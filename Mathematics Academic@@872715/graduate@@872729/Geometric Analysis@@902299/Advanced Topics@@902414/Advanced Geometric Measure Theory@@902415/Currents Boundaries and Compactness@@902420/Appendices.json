No numerical approximation is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for a justification of several properties of the current $T = \\partial\\llbracket E\\rrbracket$ and for the computation of its mass $M(T)$.\n\n**Part 1: Justification**\n\nFirst, we establish that the set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of finite perimeter. The set $E$ is the union of a closed rectangle $R = [0,L]\\times[0,H]$ and a closed semicircular region $\\bar{S} = \\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\ (x-\\tfrac{L}{2})^{2}+(y-H)^{2}\\le r^{2},\\ y\\ge H\\}$. The topological boundary $\\partial E$ is composed of a finite number of smooth ($C^\\infty$) curves: four line segments and one circular arc. Specifically, $\\partial E$ consists of the segments $[0,L]\\times\\{0\\}$, $\\{0\\}\\times[0,H]$, $\\{L\\}\\times[0,H]$, $[0, \\frac{L}{2}-r]\\times\\{H\\}$, $[\\frac{L}{2}+r, L]\\times\\{H\\}$, and the arc $\\{(x,y) : (x-\\frac{L}{2})^2+(y-H)^2=r^2, yH\\}$. A set whose boundary is piecewise $C^1$ is a set with a Lipschitz boundary. A classical result in geometric measure theory states that any bounded open set with a Lipschitz boundary is a set of finite perimeter (a Caccioppoli set). The perimeter of $E$, denoted $\\operatorname{Per}(E)$, is defined as the total variation of the distributional gradient of its characteristic function $\\chi_E$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Per}(E) = \\sup \\left\\{ \\int_E \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{v} \\, d\\mathcal{L}^2 : \\mathbf{v} \\in C_c^1(\\mathbb{R}^2; \\mathbb{R}^2), \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_{L^\\infty} \\le 1 \\right\\} = |D\\chi_E|(\\mathbb{R}^2)\n$$\nSince $E$ is a bounded set with a piecewise $C^1$ boundary, its perimeter is finite.\n\nNext, we address the properties of the currents. The current $\\llbracket E \\rrbracket$ is the $2$-current associated with the characteristic function $\\chi_E$ of the set $E$. It acts on any smooth $2$-form $\\omega$ with compact support as $\\langle \\llbracket E \\rrbracket, \\omega \\rangle = \\int_E \\omega$. Since $E$ is a bounded measurable set, its Lebesgue measure $\\mathcal{L}^2(E)$ is finite, which equals the mass of the current, $M(\\llbracket E \\rrbracket) = \\mathcal{L}^2(E)$. As $\\llbracket E \\rrbracket$ is defined by integration over a set with integer multiplicity (here, $1$), it is an integral current.\n\nThe boundary current $T$ is defined by duality via Stokes' theorem for currents. For any smooth $1$-form $\\phi$ with compact support, we have:\n$$\n\\langle T, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\partial \\llbracket E \\rrbracket, \\phi \\rangle := \\langle \\llbracket E \\rrbracket, d\\phi \\rangle = \\int_E d\\phi\n$$\nA fundamental theorem of Federer and Fleming states that the boundary of an integral $k$-current is an integral $(k-1)$-current. Since $\\llbracket E \\rrbracket$ is an integral $2$-current, its boundary $T = \\partial \\llbracket E \\rrbracket$ is an integral $1$-current.\n\nNow, we relate the mass of $T$ to the perimeter of $E$. The Gauss–Green theorem for sets of finite perimeter states that the distributional gradient $D\\chi_E$ is a vector-valued Radon measure represented as $D\\chi_E = -\\nu_E \\mathcal{H}^1 \\lfloor_{\\partial^*E}$, where $\\partial^*E$ is the reduced boundary of $E$, $\\nu_E$ is the measure-theoretic outward unit normal vector field on $\\partial^*E$, and $\\mathcal{H}^1$ is the $1$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The perimeter is given by $\\operatorname{Per}(E) = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\partial^*E)$.\n\nThe structure theorem for integral currents asserts that the boundary current $T = \\partial \\llbracket E \\rrbracket$ corresponds to integration over the reduced boundary $\\partial^*E$ with the appropriate orientation. Specifically, $T$ is the rectifiable current $\\tau(\\partial^*E, 1, \\tau_E)$, where $\\tau_E$ is the oriented unit tangent field on $\\partial^*E$ compatible with the outward normal $\\nu_E$ and the orientation of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The mass of this current is, by definition:\n$$\nM(T) = \\int_{\\partial^*E} 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1 = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\partial^*E)\n$$\nCombining these results, we have $M(T) = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\partial^*E) = \\operatorname{Per}(E)$. For a set $E$ with a piecewise $C^1$ boundary, the reduced boundary $\\partial^*E$ coincides with the topological boundary $\\partial E$ except for a finite set of points (the corners), which has $\\mathcal{H}^1$-measure zero. Therefore, $\\mathcal{H}^1(\\partial^*E) = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\partial E)$, where the latter is the standard arclength of the boundary curve. Thus, $M(T)$ is precisely the geometric perimeter of the set $E$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation**\n\nTo compute $M(T)$, we calculate the arclength of the boundary of $E$, $\\partial E$. The boundary is composed of five distinct pieces:\n1.  The bottom edge of the rectangle: A line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(L,0)$. Its length is $L$.\n2.  The left edge of the rectangle: A line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(0,H)$. Its length is $H$.\n3.  The right edge of the rectangle: A line segment from $(L,0)$ to $(L,H)$. Its length is $H$.\n4.  The parts of the top edge of the rectangle not covered by the base of the semicircle. This consists of two segments:\n    - From $(0,H)$ to $(\\frac{L}{2}-r, H)$, with length $\\frac{L}{2}-r$.\n    - From $(\\frac{L}{2}+r, H)$ to $(L,H)$, with length $L - (\\frac{L}{2}+r) = \\frac{L}{2}-r$.\n    The total length of these two segments is $(\\frac{L}{2}-r) + (\\frac{L}{2}-r) = L-2r$.\n5.  The semicircular arc of radius $r$. The circumference of a full circle of radius $r$ is $2\\pi r$. The length of the semicircular arc is half of this, which is $\\pi r$.\n\nThe total mass $M(T)$ is the sum of the lengths of these boundary components:\n$$\nM(T) = \\operatorname{Per}(E) = L + H + H + (L-2r) + \\pi r\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\nM(T) = 2L + 2H - 2r + \\pi r = 2L + 2H + (\\pi-2)r\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the mass of the boundary current $T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2L+2H+(\\pi-2)r}$$", "id": "3027348"}, {"introduction": "A key strength of the current framework is its elegant behavior under mappings, captured by the pushforward operation.

We are asked to analyze the pushforward current $f_{\\#}T$ and compute the ratio of its mass to the mass of $T$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the pushforward current $f_{\\#}T$. By definition, its action on a test $1$-form $\\omega$ is $f_{\\#}T(\\omega) = T(f^{\\#}\\omega)$, where $f^{\\#}\\omega$ is the pullback of $\\omega$ by $f$. The pullback is defined at a point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for a tangent vector $v \\in T_x\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ as\n$$\n(f^{\\#}\\omega)_x(v) = \\omega_{f(x)}(Df_x v)\n$$\nFor the map $f(x) = 2x$, the differential $Df_x$ is the linear map that multiplies vectors by $2$, represented by the matrix $2I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. Thus, $Df_x v = 2v$. Substituting this into the pullback definition, we get\n$$\n(f^{\\#}\\omega)_x(v) = \\omega_{2x}(2v)\n$$\nNow we can compute the action of $f_{\\#}T$:\n$$\nf_{\\#}T(\\omega) = T(f^{\\#}\\omega) = \\int_{S^{1}} f^{\\#}\\omega\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use a parametrization of $S^{1}$. Let $\\gamma: [0, 2\\pi] \\to S^{1}$ be the standard counterclockwise parametrization $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos(t), \\sin(t))$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin(t), \\cos(t))$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{1}} f^{\\#}\\omega = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (f^{\\#}\\omega)_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) \\, dt\n$$\nUsing the expression for the pullback, we have:\n$$\n(f^{\\#}\\omega)_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t)) = \\omega_{f(\\gamma(t))}(Df_{\\gamma(t)}\\gamma'(t)) = \\omega_{2\\gamma(t)}(2\\gamma'(t))\n$$\nThe integral for $f_{\\#}T(\\omega)$ is therefore:\n$$\nf_{\\#}T(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\omega_{2\\gamma(t)}(2\\gamma'(t)) \\, dt\n$$\nLet us define a new path $\\eta(t) = f(\\gamma(t)) = 2\\gamma(t)$. This path parametrizes a circle of radius $2$, centered at the origin, which we denote $C_2$. The tangent vector to this new path is $\\eta'(t) = 2\\gamma'(t)$.

Since the determinant of the Jacobian $Df_x$ is $\\det(2I) = 4  0$, the map $f$ is orientation-preserving. Therefore, $f_{\\#}T$ is the $1$-dimensional integral current with geometric support on the circle of radius $2$, oriented counterclockwise, and with multiplicity $1$.\n\nNext, we compute the masses $M(T)$ and $M(f_{\\#}T)$ and their ratio.

So, as $\\omega$ ranges over all forms with sup-comass at most $1$, $\\phi=f^{\\#}\\omega$ ranges over all forms with sup-comass at most $2$.\nWe can now rewrite the expression for $M(f_{\\#}T)$:\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = \\sup\\left\\{ T(\\phi) : \\phi \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{2}), \\ \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} |\\phi_x| \\leq 2 \\right\\}\n$$\nLet's introduce a new form $\\psi = \\phi/2$.

Therefore, we have derived from first principles that\n$$\nM(f_{\\#}T) = 2 M(T)\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the geometric interpretation: since $f_{\\#}T$ is the current on a circle of radius $2$, its mass is the length of this circle, $M(f_{\\#}T) = 2\\pi(2) = 4\\pi$.

Its action on a test function $\\phi$ is:\n$$\nV_n(\\phi) = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + V_{C_{1+1/n}}(\\phi)\n$$\nThe action of a varifold $V_\\Gamma$ associated with a curve $\\Gamma$ is given by integration over the curve:\n$$\nV_\\Gamma(\\phi) = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\phi(x, T_x\\Gamma) \\, d\\mathcal{H}^1(x)\n$$\nwhere $T_x\\Gamma$ is the unoriented tangent line to $\\Gamma$ at $x$.\n\nFor the circle $C_r$, we can use the parameterization $\\gamma_r(t) = (r\\cos t, r\\sin t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The length element is $d\\mathcal{H}^1 = r dt$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma_r'(t) = (-r\\sin t, r\\cos t)$, and the unoriented tangent line $T_{\\gamma_r(t)}C_r$ is the one-dimensional subspace spanned by $(-\\sin t, \\cos t)$. Let us denote this line by $L(t)$, which is independent of the radius $r$.\n\nThe action of $V_{C_r}$ on $\\phi$ is:\n$$\nV_{C_r}(\\phi) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_r(t), L(t)) r \\, dt\n$$\nThus, for $V_n$, we have:\n$$\nV_n(\\phi) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_1(t), L(t)) \\cdot 1 \\, dt + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t)) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\, dt\n$$\nWe want to find the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. The first term is constant with respect to $n$. For the second term, we consider the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi\\left(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t)\\right) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\, dt\n$$\nThe test function $\\phi$ is continuous and has compact support. The function $(r,t) \\mapsto \\phi(\\gamma_r(t), L(t))r$ is continuous on $(0, \\infty) \\times [0, 2\\pi]$. As $n\\to\\infty$, $1+1/n \\to 1$ and $\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t) \\to \\gamma_1(t)$ uniformly in $t$. By continuity of $\\phi$, the integrand $\\phi(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t))(1+1/n)$ converges to $\\phi(\\gamma_1(t), L(t)) \\cdot 1$ for each $t$. Since the integration domain $[0, 2\\pi]$ is compact and the integrand is bounded (as $\\phi$ has compact support), we can apply the dominated convergence theorem (or simply the continuity of the parametric integral) to interchange the limit and the integral:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} V_n(\\phi) = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left[ \\phi\\left(\\gamma_{1+1/n}(t), L(t)\\right) \\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\right] dt\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} V_n(\\phi) = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\phi(\\gamma_1(t), L(t)) \\cdot 1 \\, dt = V_{C_1}(\\phi) + V_{C_1}(\\phi) = 2V_{C_1}(\\phi)\n$$\nThis holds for any test function $\\phi$, so the sequence of varifolds $\\{V_n\\}_{n\\geq 1}$ converges weakly to the varifold $V = 2V_{C_1}$. This is the varifold associated with the unit circle $C_1$ with a constant multiplicity of $2$.\n\nThe mass of the limiting varifold $V = 2V_{C_1}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\|V\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = \\|2V_{C_1}\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 2\\|V_{C_1}\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2)\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the mass of a varifold associated with a smooth curve $\\Gamma$ with multiplicity $1$ is its length: $\\|V_{\\Gamma}\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = \\mathcal{H}^1(\\Gamma)$.\nFor the unit circle $C_1$, its length (1D Hausdorff measure) is its circumference:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^1(C_1) = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi\n$$\nTherefore, the mass of the limiting varifold is:\n$$\n\\|V\\|(\\mathbb{R}^2) = 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^1(C_1) = 2(2\\pi) = 4\\pi\n$$\n\nSummary of results:\n- The mass of the limiting current is $0$.\n- The mass of the limiting varifold is $4\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  4\\pi\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3027378"}]}
