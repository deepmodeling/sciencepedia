The assumption of a radially symmetric Kähler potential $\\varphi(s)$ where $s = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |z^{i}|^{2}$ is justified by the $U(n+1)$ invariance. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution (up to normalization). Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Derivation of the Kähler-Einstein Metric Potential\n\nLet the Kähler potential be $\\varphi(s)$, where $s = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} z^{k}\\bar{z}^{k}$. The components of the Hermitian metric $g_{i\\bar{j}}$ are given by $g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\varphi}{\\partial z^{i}\\,\\partial \\bar{z}^{j}}$. Using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial\\bar{z}^{j}} = \\frac{d\\varphi}{ds} \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial\\bar{z}^{j}} = \\varphi'(s) z^{j} $$\n$$ g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^{i}} \\left( \\varphi'(s) z^{j} \\right) = \\varphi'(s)\\delta_{ij} + z^{j} \\frac{\\partial(\\varphi'(s))}{\\partial z^{i}} = \\varphi'(s)\\delta_{ij} + z^{j} \\varphi''(s) \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial z^{i}} $$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial z^{i}} = \\bar{z}^{i}$, we obtain the metric tensor:\n$$ g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\varphi'(s)\\delta_{ij} + \\varphi''(s)\\bar{z}^{i}z^{j} $$\nThis matrix is of the form $A + u v^{\\dagger}$, where $A = \\varphi'(s)I_{n}$, $u = \\varphi''(s)\\bar{z}$, and $v = z$.

Due to the rotational symmetry, $h$ must be constant. Let's denote this constant by $C$.\n$$ \\ln \\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}) = -\\lambda\\varphi(s) - C $$\nExponentiating both sides gives $\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}) = K e^{-\\lambda\\varphi(s)}$, where $K = e^{-C}$ is a positive constant.\nWe now have the ordinary differential equation for $\\varphi(s)$:\n$$ (\\varphi'(s))^{n-1} \\frac{d}{ds}(s\\varphi'(s)) = K e^{-\\lambda\\varphi(s)} $$\nThe standard metric on $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is the Fubini-Study metric, whose potential is known to be logarithmic.

The standard normalization for the Fubini-Study metric corresponds to choosing $C_{0}=1$. With this choice, we find $\\lambda = n+1$. The Kähler potential for the unique (up to scaling and isometries) Kähler-Einstein metric on $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ is:\n$$ \\varphi(s) = \\ln(1+s) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |z^{i}|^{2}\\right) $$\n\n### Verification and Scalar Curvature for $n=1$ ($\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$)\n\nFor $n=1$, the space is $\\mathbb{CP}^{1} \\cong S^{2}$.

For $n=1$, this is $S = 2g^{1\\bar{1}}R_{1\\bar{1}}$.\nThe Ricci tensor is $R_{i\\bar{j}} = -\\partial_{i}\\partial_{\\bar{j}} \\ln\\det(g)$. For $n=1$, $\\det(g) = g_{1\\bar{1}}$.\n$$ R_{1\\bar{1}} = -\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial z\\partial\\bar{z}} \\ln(g_{1\\bar{1}}) = -\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial z\\partial\\bar{z}} (-2\\ln(1+|z|^{2})) = 2 \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial z\\partial\\bar{z}} \\ln(1+|z|^{2}) = 2g_{1\\bar{1}} $$\nThe inverse metric is $g^{1\\bar{1}} = (g_{1\\bar{1}})^{-1}$.\n$$ S = 2g^{1\\bar{1}}R_{1\\bar{1}} = 2 (g_{1\\bar{1}})^{-1} (2g_{1\\bar{1}}) = 4 $$\nThe real scalar curvature for $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ is $4$.\n\n### Scalar Curvature for General $n$\n\nFor any Kähler-Einstein metric, the Ricci tensor $R_{i\\bar{j}}$ is proportional to the metric tensor $g_{i\\bar{j}}$. From the definitions $\\rho=\\sqrt{-1}R_{i\\bar{j}}dz^i \\wedge d\\bar{z}^j$ and $\\omega=\\sqrt{-1}g_{i\\bar{j}}dz^i \\wedge d\\bar{z}^j$, the condition $\\rho=\\lambda\\omega$ implies:\n$$ R_{i\\bar{j}} = \\lambda g_{i\\bar{j}} $$\nThe real scalar curvature is defined as $S = 2 g^{i\\bar{j}} R_{i\\bar{j}}$. Substituting the relation for $R_{i\\bar{j}}$:\n$$ S = 2 g^{i\\bar{j}} (\\lambda g_{i\\bar{j}}) = 2\\lambda (g^{i\\bar{j}} g_{i\\bar{j}}) $$\nThe term $g^{i\\bar{j}} g_{i\\bar{j}} = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} g^{i\\bar{j}} g_{i\\bar{j}}$ is a scalar invariant. Due to the homogeneity of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ under the action of $U(n+1)$, we can compute this invariant at any convenient point. Let us choose a point where $z = (r, 0, \\dots, 0)$ with $r \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$. At this point, $s = r^{2}$. The metric tensor components are:\n$$ g_{1\\bar{1}} = \\varphi'(s) + \\varphi''(s) r^{2} = \\varphi'(s) + s\\varphi''(s) $$\n$$ g_{i\\bar{i}} = \\varphi'(s) \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\} $$\n$$ g_{i\\bar{j}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j $$\nThe metric matrix is diagonal at this point. Its inverse $g^{i\\bar{j}}$ is also diagonal with components being the reciprocal of the diagonal elements of $g_{i\\bar{j}}$.\nThe contraction $g^{i\\bar{j}} g_{i\\bar{j}}$ becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g^{i\\bar{i}} g_{i\\bar{i}} = g^{1\\bar{1}}g_{1\\bar{1}} + \\sum_{i=2}^{n} g^{i\\bar{i}}g_{i\\bar{i}} = 1 + \\sum_{i=2}^{n} 1 = 1 + (n-1) = n $$\nThus, the scalar invariant $g^{i\\bar{j}} g_{i\\bar{j}}$ is equal to $n$.\nThe scalar curvature is therefore:\n$$ S = 2\\lambda n $$\nUsing our derived value $\\lambda = n+1$ for the normalized Fubini-Study metric, we obtain:\n$$ S = 2n(n+1) $$\nThis general formula is consistent with our result for $n=1$, which gives $S = 2(1)(1+1) = 4$.\n\nThe final results are: the real scalar curvature for $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ is $4$, and for $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ it is $2n(n+1)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4  2n(n+1) \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3031553"}, {"introduction": "The existence of a Kähler-Einstein metric is not guaranteed and is deeply connected to an algebraic concept known as K-stability.

The problem is stated objectively using standard mathematical terminology and contains no inconsistencies or missing information.\n\nWe begin by validating the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Manifold: Complex projective line, $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$.\n- Reference Kähler form: Fubini–Study form $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$.\n- Kähler potential for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{FS}}(z,\\bar{z})=\\ln(1+|z|^{2})$.\n- Definition of Kähler form from potential: $\\omega=\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\phi$.\n- Kähler-Einstein property of $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ on $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$: $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}})=2\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$.\n- Governing equation: The unnormalized Kähler-Ricci flow (KRF) is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\,\\omega(t) = -\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t))$.\n- Initial condition: $\\omega(0) = \\omega_{0} = a_{0}\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ for a constant $a_{0}0$.\n- Formula for the Ricci form: $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)=-\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\ln\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})$.\n- Property of the Ricci form: For a constant $c0$, $\\mathrm{Ric}(c\\,\\omega)=\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)$.\n- Ansatz for the solution: The evolving Kähler form is of the form $\\omega(t) = a(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$, where $a(t)$ is a function of time $t$ only.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a standard exercise in Kähler geometry. All premises, including the properties of the Fubini-Study metric and the definition of the Kähler-Ricci flow, are fundamental and factually correct. The problem is self-contained and consistent. The ansatz is a standard method for solving the KRF on homogeneous spaces. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The problem asks for the explicit form of the function $a(t)$ under the given conditions. We substitute the ansatz $\\omega(t) = a(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ into the Kähler-Ricci flow equation.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the KRF equation is the time derivative of $\\omega(t)$. Since $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ is a time-independent form and $a(t)$ is a function of $t$ only, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\,\\omega(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\big(a(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}\\big) = \\frac{da(t)}{dt}\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}} = a'(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the KRF equation involves the Ricci form of $\\omega(t)$, which is $-\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t))$. We need to compute $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = \\mathrm{Ric}(a(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}})$. Let $g_{\\mathrm{FS},i\\bar{j}}$ be the components of the metric tensor corresponding to $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$. The metric tensor for $\\omega(t)$ is then $g_{i\\bar{j}}(t) = a(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{FS},i\\bar{j}}$.\n\nThe Ricci form is given by $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega) = -\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\ln\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}})$. Since we are on $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$, the complex dimension is $n=1$. The metric tensor is represented by a single component $g_{1\\bar{1}}$, so its determinant is just the component itself: $\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}(t)) = g_{1\\bar{1}}(t) = a(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{FS},1\\bar{1}}$.\n\nNow we compute the Ricci form of $\\omega(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = -\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\ln\\big(\\det(g_{i\\bar{j}}(t))\\big) = -\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\ln\\big(a(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{FS},1\\bar{1}}\\big)\n$$\nUsing the property of the logarithm, $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(y)$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = -\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\big(\\ln(a(t)) + \\ln(g_{\\mathrm{FS},1\\bar{1}})\\big)\n$$\nSince $a(t)$ is a function of time $t$ only and does not depend on the spatial complex coordinates $z$ and $\\bar{z}$, the Dolbeault operators $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$ acting on $\\ln(a(t))$ are zero: $\\partial(\\ln(a(t))) = 0$ and $\\bar{\\partial}(\\ln(a(t))) = 0$. Consequently, $\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\ln(a(t))=0$.\nThis simplifies the expression for the Ricci form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = -\\sqrt{-1}\\,\\partial\\bar{\\partial}\\,\\ln(g_{\\mathrm{FS},1\\bar{1}}) = \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}})\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the Ricci form is invariant under scaling by a purely time-dependent (i.e., spatially constant) factor, a generalization of the property cited in the problem for a numerical constant.\n\nThe problem states the Kähler-Einstein identity for $\\mathbb{CP}^{1}$: $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}) = 2\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$.\nTherefore, the RHS of the KRF equation is:\n$$\n-\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega(t)) = -\\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}) = -2\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\n\nNow, we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$$\na'(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}} = -2\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nSince $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ is a volume form (and thus non-zero everywhere), we can equate the scalar coefficients to obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $a(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = -2\n$$\n\nWe solve this simple first-order ODE by direct integration:\n$$\n\\int da = \\int -2\\,dt\n$$\n$$\na(t) = -2t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We determine $C$ using the initial condition $\\omega(0) = a_{0}\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$. Our ansatz gives $\\omega(0) = a(0)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$, which implies $a(0) = a_{0}$.\nSubstituting $t=0$ into the solution for $a(t)$:\n$$\na(0) = -2(0) + C = C\n$$\nThus, the constant of integration is $C = a_{0}$.\nThe explicit closed-form expression for $a(t)$ is:\n$$\na(t) = a_{0} - 2t\n$$\nThis solution is valid as long as the metric remains positive definite, i.e., $a(t)  0$, which holds for $t  a_{0}/2$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the convergence of the normalized metric $\\tilde{\\omega}(t) = \\omega(t)/a(t)$.\nSubstituting the ansatz $\\omega(t) = a(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$, we find:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\omega}(t) = \\frac{a(t)\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}}{a(t)} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nfor all $t  a_{0}/2$. The normalized metric is constant in time and is equal to the Fubini-Study metric. Therefore, it does not dynamically evolve but remains fixed at the Kähler-Einstein metric $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$. This is expected behavior for an initial metric that is already homothetic to an Einstein metric. The unnormalized flow simply shrinks the manifold to a point in finite time, while the normalized flow, which rescales the volume to be constant, reveals that the \"shape\" of the metric is already at its fixed point, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{FS}}$. The convergence is trivial in this case.\n\nThe final answer required is the closed-form expression for $a(t)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a_{0} - 2t}\n$$", "id": "3031602"}]}
