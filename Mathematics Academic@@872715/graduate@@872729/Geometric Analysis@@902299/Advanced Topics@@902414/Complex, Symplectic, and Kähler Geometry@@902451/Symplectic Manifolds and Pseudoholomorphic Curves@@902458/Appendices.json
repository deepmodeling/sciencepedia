Using Cartan's magic formula, $\\mathcal{L}_X \\omega = d(\\iota_X \\omega) + \\iota_X(d\\omega)$, and the fact that $\\omega$ is a closed form ($d\\omega=0$), the condition for $X$ to be symplectic simplifies to:\n$$d(\\iota_X \\omega) = 0$$\nThis means that a vector field $X$ is symplectic if and only if the $1$-form $\\iota_X \\omega$ is a closed form.\n\n**Relationship between Symplectic and Hamiltonian Vector Fields:**\nBy definition, a vector field $X$ is Hamiltonian if the $1$-form $\\iota_X \\omega$ is an exact form. Since any exact form is also closed (because $d(df) = d^2 f = 0$ for any function $f$), it follows immediately that every Hamiltonian vector field is symplectic.\n\nThe distinction between symplectic and Hamiltonian vector fields reduces to the distinction between closed and exact $1$-forms. The first de Rham cohomology group, $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$, is defined as the quotient space of closed $1$-forms by exact $1$-forms. Therefore, $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$ measures the obstruction for a symplectic vector field to be Hamiltonian.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R}) = 0$, then every symplectic vector field on $M$ is Hamiltonian.**\nIf $X$ is a symplectic vector field, the $1$-form $\\iota_X \\omega$ is closed, as established above. The condition $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R}) = 0$ means that every closed $1$-form on $M$ is also an exact form. Therefore, $\\iota_X \\omega$ must be exact. This implies there exists a smooth function $H \\colon M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\iota_X \\omega = dH$. This is precisely the definition of a Hamiltonian vector field. Thus, the statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. On the standard $2$-torus $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2/\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with coordinates $(x,y)$ modulo $1$ and symplectic form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$, the constant vector field $X = \\partial_x$ generates a symplectic flow that is not Hamiltonian.**\nFirst, we verify that $X = \\partial_x$ is symplectic on $(T^2, \\omega = dx \\wedge dy)$. We compute the $1$-form $\\iota_X \\omega$:\n$$ \\iota_X \\omega = \\iota_{\\partial_x} (dx \\wedge dy) = (\\iota_{\\partial_x} dx) \\wedge dy - dx \\wedge (\\iota_{\\partial_x} dy) $$\nUsing the definitions $dx(v) = v_x$ and $dy(v) = v_y$, we have $\\iota_{\\partial_x} dx = dx(\\partial_x) = 1$ and $\\iota_{\\partial_x} dy = dy(\\partial_x) = 0$.\n$$ \\iota_X \\omega = 1 \\cdot dy - dx \\cdot 0 = dy $$\nTo check if $X$ is symplectic, we check if this form is closed:\n$$ d(\\iota_X \\omega) = d(dy) = 0 $$\nSince $d(\\iota_X \\omega)=0$, the vector field $X = \\partial_x$ is symplectic.\nNext, we determine if $X$ is Hamiltonian. This requires the form $\\iota_X \\omega = dy$ to be exact. If $dy$ were exact, there would exist a smooth function $H \\colon T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $dH = dy$. On $T^2$, this would mean $dH = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} dy = dy$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = 1$. Integrating the latter gives $H(x,y) = y + c(x)$. The former condition then implies $c'(x)=0$, so $c(x)$ is a constant, say $c_0$. Thus, $H(x,y) = y + c_0$. However, this function is not well-defined on the torus $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2/\\mathbb{Z}^2$, because points $(x,y)$ and $(x, y+1)$ are identified, but $H(x, y+1) = (y+1)+c_0 = H(x,y)+1 \\neq H(x,y)$. Therefore, no such global function $H$ exists, and the form $dy$ is not exact. The vector field $X$ is thus symplectic but not Hamiltonian.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. For any symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$, a vector field $X$ is symplectic if and only if $\\iota_X \\omega$ is exact.**\nThis statement asserts that the set of symplectic vector fields is identical to the set of Hamiltonian vector fields.\nThe implication \"if $\\iota_X \\omega$ is exact, then $X$ is symplectic\" is true. If $\\iota_X \\omega$ is exact, it is also closed, so $d(\\iota_X \\omega) = 0$, which is the condition for $X$ to be symplectic.\nThe implication \"if $X$ is symplectic, then $\\iota_X \\omega$ is exact\" is false in general. A vector field $X$ being symplectic means $\\iota_X \\omega$ is closed. This form is exact only if its cohomology class is zero. As demonstrated in the analysis of option B, the vector field $X = \\partial_x$ on the torus $T^2$ is symplectic, but $\\iota_X \\omega = dy$ is not exact. Therefore, the \"if and only if\" statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The quotient of the space of symplectic vector fields by the subspace of Hamiltonian vector fields is canonically isomorphic to $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$ via $X \\mapsto [\\iota_X \\omega]$.**\nLet $\\text{Vect}_\\text{symp}(M)$ be the real vector space of symplectic vector fields and $\\text{Vect}_\\text{Ham}(M)$ be the subspace of Hamiltonian vector fields. Consider the map $\\Phi \\colon \\text{Vect}_\\text{symp}(M) \\to H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$ defined by $\\Phi(X) = [\\iota_X \\omega]$.\n1.  **Well-defined:** If $X \\in \\text{Vect}_\\text{symp}(M)$, then $\\iota_X \\omega$ is a closed $1$-form, so its cohomology class $[\\iota_X \\omega]$ is a well-defined element of $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$.\n2.  **Linearity:** The map $X \\mapsto \\iota_X \\omega$ is linear, and the projection to cohomology is linear, so $\\Phi$ is a linear map.\n3.  **Kernel:** The kernel of $\\Phi$ consists of vector fields $X$ such that $\\Phi(X)=0$. This means $[\\iota_X \\omega]=0$, which is equivalent to the form $\\iota_X \\omega$ being exact. By definition, these are precisely the Hamiltonian vector fields. So, $\\ker(\\Phi) = \\text{Vect}_\\text{Ham}(M)$.\n4.  **Surjectivity:** We need to show that for any class $[\\alpha] \\in H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$, there exists a symplectic vector field $X$ such that $\\Phi(X) = [\\alpha]$. Let $\\alpha$ be a closed $1$-form representing the class $[\\alpha]$. Since $\\omega$ is a non-degenerate $2$-form, the map from vector fields to $1$-forms, $X \\mapsto \\iota_X \\omega$, is an isomorphism of vector bundles $TM \\to T^*M$. Thus, there exists a unique vector field $X_\\alpha$ such that $\\iota_{X_\\alpha} \\omega = \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha$ is a closed form, we have $d(\\iota_{X_\\alpha} \\omega) = d\\alpha = 0$, which means $X_\\alpha$ is a symplectic vector field. Then $\\Phi(X_\\alpha) = [\\iota_{X_\\alpha} \\omega] = [\\alpha]$, showing the map is surjective.\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for vector spaces, $\\text{Vect}_\\text{symp}(M) / \\ker(\\Phi) \\cong \\text{im}(\\Phi)$. Substituting our findings, we get $\\text{Vect}_\\text{symp}(M) / \\text{Vect}_\\text{Ham}(M) \\cong H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})$. The isomorphism is the one described.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. If $M$ is simply connected, then every symplectic vector field on $M$ is Hamiltonian.**\nA manifold $M$ being simply connected means its fundamental group is trivial, $\\pi_1(M) = \\{e\\}$. By the Hurewicz theorem, the first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $H_1(M;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(M)_{ab}$. If $\\pi_1(M)$ is trivial, so is $H_1(M;\\mathbb{Z})$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem provides an isomorphism $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(M;\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{R})$. Since $H_1(M;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\{0\\}$, the only homomorphism from it to $\\mathbb{R}$ is the zero map. Thus, $H^1(M;\\mathbb{R})=\\{0\\}$.

A map $u: \\Sigma \\to M$ from a Riemann surface $(\\Sigma, j)$ to an almost complex manifold $(M, J)$ is $J$-holomorphic if it satisfies the equation $\\bar{\\partial}_{j,J}u = 0$, where $\\bar{\\partial}_{j,J}u = \\frac{1}{2}(du + J \\circ du \\circ j)$.\n\nThe deformation theory of $J$-holomorphic maps starts by considering the linearization of this equation. For a fixed domain $(\\Sigma, j)$, the linearization of the $\\bar{\\partial}_{j,J}$ operator at a solution $u$ is a real-linear elliptic operator, known as the Cauchy-Riemann operator:\n$$D_u : \\Gamma(\\Sigma, u^*TM) \\to \\Omega^{0,1}(\\Sigma, u^*TM)$$\nHere, $\\Gamma(\\Sigma, u^*TM)$ is the space of smooth sections of the pullback tangent bundle $u^*TM$, which represents the tangent space to the space of maps. $\\Omega^{0,1}(\\Sigma, u^*TM)$ is the space of $(0,1)$-forms on $\\Sigma$ with values in $u^*TM$.\n\nThe expected dimension of the space of solutions for a *fixed* domain is the real Fredholm index of $D_u$. We can compute this index using the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, or more specifically for Riemann surfaces, the Riemann-Roch theorem. The pullback bundle $u^*TM$ is a complex vector bundle over $\\Sigma$ of rank $n = \\frac{1}{2}\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} M$. The associated complex operator is the Dolbeault operator $\\bar{\\partial}_{u^*TM}$. The Riemann-Roch theorem gives its complex index:\n$$ \\text{index}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\bar{\\partial}_{u^*TM}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}H^0(\\Sigma, u^*TM) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}H^1(\\Sigma, u^*TM) = c_1(u^*TM)[\\Sigma] + \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{C}}(u^*TM)(1-g) $$\nwhere $g$ is the genus of $\\Sigma$, and $c_1(u^*TM)[\\Sigma]$ is the degree of the bundle, i.e., the first Chern class of $u^*TM$ evaluated on the fundamental class of $\\Sigma$. The real index is twice the complex index.\n\nThe terms are identified as follows:\n- $\\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{C}}(u^*TM) = n = \\frac{1}{2}\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M$.\n- The degree of the pullback bundle is $c_1(u^*TM)[\\Sigma] = \\langle u^*c_1(TM), [\\Sigma] \\rangle = \\langle c_1(TM), u_*[\\Sigma] \\rangle$. Since the map $u$ represents the homology class $A \\in H_2(M; \\mathbb{Z})$, we have $u_*[\\Sigma] = A$. Thus, $c_1(u^*TM)[\\Sigma] = \\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle$, which we denote by $c_1(A)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the real index, we get:\n$$ \\text{index}_{\\mathbb{R}}(D_u) = 2 \\left( \\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + n(1-g) \\right) = 2\\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M(1-g) $$\nThis expression gives the expected dimension of the space of $J$-holomorphic maps from a fixed domain $(\\Sigma, j)$.\n\nThe full moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,k}(A, J)$ also involves deformations of the domain curve $(\\Sigma, j)$ and its $k$ marked points. The theory of Fredholm operators on families shows that the virtual dimension of the total moduli space is the sum of the index for the fixed-domain problem and the dimension of the space of possible domains.\n\nThe space of domains is the moduli space of stable curves of genus $g$ with $k$ marked points, $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,k}$.

This dimension formula correctly accounts for the automorphisms of the domain.\n\nThe expected real dimension of $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,k}(A, J)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,k}(A, J) = \\text{index}_{\\mathbb{R}}(D_u) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,k} $$\nAssuming $2g-2+k>0$, we have:\n$$ \\dim = \\left( 2\\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M(1-g) \\right) + (6g-6+2k) $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ \\dim = 2\\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M - g\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M + 6g - 6 + 2k $$\n$$ \\dim = 2\\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + (\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M - 6)(1-g) - (\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M-6) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}M - 6 + 2k $$\n$$ \\dim = (\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} M - 6)(1-g) + 2\\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + 2k $$\nThis formula is the general expression for the expected real dimension and holds more generally even when $2g-2+k \\le 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation for the Specific Case**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this dimension for $M=\\mathbb{C}P^2$, with $A$ being the class of a projective line, and $g=0$.\nThe givens for the specific case are:\n- $M = \\mathbb{C}P^2$, so its real dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} M = 4$.

For $M=\\mathbb{C}P^2$, we have $n=2$:\n$$ c(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = (1+H)^3 = 1+3H+3H^2+H^3(\\text{in } H^*(\\mathbb{C}P^2;\\mathbb{Z}))$$\nThe first Chern class is the term of degree $2$, so $c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2) = 3H$.\nThe evaluation on the homology class $A=L$ is given by the intersection product:\n$$ \\langle c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2), L \\rangle = \\int_L 3H = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H \\smile \\text{PD}(L) $$\nSince the Poincaré dual of the line class $L$ is the hyperplane class $H$, we have:\n$$ \\langle c_1(T\\mathbb{C}P^2), L \\rangle = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H \\smile H = 3 \\int_{\\mathbb{C}P^2} H^2 = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3 $$\nNow we substitute all values into the general dimension formula:\n$$ \\dim = (\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} M - 6)(1-g) + 2\\langle c_1(TM), A \\rangle + 2k $$\n$$ \\dim = (4-6)(1-0) + 2(3) + 2k $$\n$$ \\dim = (-2)(1) + 6 + 2k = -2 + 6 + 2k = 4+2k $$\nThe expected real dimension for this case is $4+2k$.\n\n**Part 3: Verification by Geometric Count**\n\nWe now verify this result by a direct count of parameters for the specified moduli space. The moduli space is $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{0,k}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, L)$, which parametrizes degree-$1$ maps from $\\mathbb{P}^1$ to $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ with $k$ marked points. A degree-$1$ map is an embedding whose image is a projective line.\n\n1.  **Parameters for the map:** A map $u: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{C}P^2$ of degree $1$ is given in homogeneous coordinates $[s:t]$ on $\\mathbb{P}^1$ by $u([s:t])=[P_0(s,t):P_1(s,t):P_2(s,t)]$, where $P_0, P_1, P_2$ are linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree $1$. Each $P_i(s,t)=a_i s + b_i t$ is determined by $2$ coefficients. The map is thus specified by $3 \\times 2 = 6$ coefficients $(a_0, b_0, a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2) \\in \\mathbb{C}^6$. The condition that the polynomials are linearly independent means the $3 \\times 2$ matrix of coefficients has rank $2$, which is an open condition.\n    Since the coordinates on the target $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ are homogeneous, scaling all coefficients by a non-zero complex number $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$ does not change the map. Thus, the space of such maps is an open subset of the projective space $\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{C}^6) = \\mathbb{P}^5$. This space has complex dimension $5$.\n\n2.  **Parameters for marked points:** We have $k$ marked points $z_1, \\dots, z_k$ on the domain $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Each point adds one complex parameter. This gives $k$ additional complex parameters.\n\n3.  **Total parameters before quotienting:** The total space of data (map, marked points) has complex dimension $5+k$.\n\n4.  **Quotient by reparametrizations:** We must quotient by the group of reparametrizations of the domain, which is the automorphism group of $\\mathbb{P}^1$, $\\text{Aut}(\\mathbb{P}^1) \\cong \\text{PGL}(2, \\mathbb{C})$. This is a complex Lie group of dimension $3$. An automorphism $\\phi \\in \\text{PGL}(2, \\mathbb{C})$ acts on our data as $(u, \\{z_i\\}) \\mapsto (u \\circ \\phi^{-1}, \\{\\phi(z_i)\\})$.\n\n5.  **Final dimension:** The complex dimension of the moduli space is the dimension of the parameter space minus the dimension of the group acting (for a generic point):\n    $$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} \\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{0,k}(\\mathbb{C}P^2, L) = (5+k) - 3 = 2+k $$\nThe expected real dimension is twice the complex dimension:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} = 2(2+k) = 4+2k $$\nThis result from the geometric count matches the result from the index theorem derivation, which validates our formula for this case. The question asks for the final answer as a single closed-form expression in terms of $k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4+2k}\n$$", "id": "3033830"}]}
