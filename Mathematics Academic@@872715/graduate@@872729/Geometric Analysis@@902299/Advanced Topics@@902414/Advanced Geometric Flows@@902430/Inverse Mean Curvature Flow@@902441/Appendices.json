The radius $R$ is a positive constant.\n\nFirst, we identify the outward unit normal vector field $\\nu$ on $S_{R}^{n-1}$. At any point $x \\in S_{R}^{n-1}$, the position vector $x$ is orthogonal to the tangent space and points outward. The magnitude of this vector is $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle x, x \\rangle} = R$. To obtain a unit normal vector, we normalize the position vector:\n$$\n\\nu(x) = \\frac{x}{R}\n$$\nThis defines the outward unit normal vector field on the sphere.\n\nNext, we must compute the second fundamental form $II(X, Y) = \\langle \\nabla_{X} \\nu, Y \\rangle$ for tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_{x} S_{R}^{n-1}$. The term $\\nabla_{X} \\nu$ is the covariant derivative of the vector field $\\nu$ in the direction of the tangent vector $X$, using the ambient Euclidean connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with its standard flat metric, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is simply the standard directional derivative of vector fields.\n\nTo compute $\\nabla_X \\nu$, we can consider the vector field $\\nu(y) = y/R$ defined on an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ containing the sphere (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$). Let $X$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (which can be a tangent vector at a point $x$ on the sphere). The directional derivative is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{X} \\nu = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\nu(x+tX) - \\nu(x)}{t}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{X} \\nu = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{x+tX}{R} - \\frac{x}{R}}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{1}{R}(x+tX-x)}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{tX}{R}}{t} = \\frac{X}{R}\n$$\nThis result, $\\nabla_{X} \\nu = \\frac{X}{R}$, is valid for any point $x \\in S_{R}^{n-1}$ and any tangent vector $X \\in T_{x} S_{R}^{n-1}$.\n\nNow we can write the second fundamental form.

Thus, for tangent vectors $X, Y$, we have $g(X, Y) = \\langle X, Y \\rangle$. This allows us to express the second fundamental form in terms of the induced metric:\n$$\nII(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{R} g(X, Y)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature $H$, which is defined as the trace of the second fundamental form with respect to the induced metric, $H = \\operatorname{tr}_{g}(II)$.
