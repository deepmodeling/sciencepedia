The key quantities are the reduced distance $l(x,\\tau)$ and the reduced volume $\\tilde{V}(\\tau)$, together with the smoothness and bounded curvature of $g(t)$ on $[t_0-\\varepsilon,t_0]$.\n\nStep 1: Short-time asymptotics of the reduced distance. In normal coordinates centered at $x_0$ for the metric $g(t_0)$, for points $x$ near $x_0$, the metric is approximately Euclidean up to $O(|x|^2)$ corrections. Over the infinitesimal backward time interval $[t_0-\\tau,t_0]$ with small $\\tau$, the curvature term $R(\\gamma(s),t_0-s)$ is bounded, so $\\int_0^\\tau \\sqrt{s} R(\\gamma(s),t_0-s)\\,ds = O(\\tau^{3/2})$, which is $o(1)$ after dividing by $2\\sqrt{\\tau}$ in the definition of $l(x,\\tau)$. Hence the dominant contribution comes from the kinetic term $\\int_0^\\tau \\sqrt{s} |\\gamma'(s)|^2_{g(t_0-s)} ds$. To leading order, we may replace $g(t_0-s)$ by $g(t_0)$ and work in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nIn the Euclidean case with $R \\equiv 0$, the Euler–Lagrange equation for minimizing\n$$\nL(\\gamma) := \\int_0^\\tau \\sqrt{s} \\left|\\gamma'(s)\\right|^2 ds\n$$\nsubject to $\\gamma(0)=x_0$ and $\\gamma(\\tau)=x$ yields $\\frac{d}{ds}\\left( \\sqrt{s}\\,\\gamma'(s) \\right) = 0$, so $\\gamma'(s) = c\\, s^{-1/2}$ for a constant vector $c$. The endpoint condition gives\n$$\nx - x_0 = \\int_0^\\tau \\gamma'(s)\\,ds = c \\int_0^\\tau s^{-1/2}\\,ds = c \\cdot 2\\sqrt{\\tau} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = \\frac{x-x_0}{2\\sqrt{\\tau}}.\n$$\nThus $\\left|\\gamma'(s)\\right|^2 = \\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{4\\tau} s^{-1}$ and\n$$\nL(\\gamma_{\\min}) = \\int_0^\\tau \\sqrt{s} \\cdot \\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{4\\tau} s^{-1}\\,ds = \\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{4\\tau} \\int_0^\\tau s^{-1/2}\\,ds = \\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{4\\tau} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{\\tau} = \\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{2\\sqrt{\\tau}}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nl_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(x,\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\tau}} L(\\gamma_{\\min}) = \\frac{|x-x_0|^2}{4\\tau}.\n$$\nFor the general smooth Ricci flow, by smoothness of $g(t)$ and bounded curvature, this Euclidean asymptotic persists locally: for $x$ within $O(\\sqrt{\\tau})$ of $x_0$,\n$$\nl(x,\\tau) = \\frac{d_{g(t_0)}(x,x_0)^2}{4\\tau} + o(1) \\quad \\text{as } \\tau \\to 0^+,\n$$\nwith the $o(1)$ uniform on compact sets after parabolic rescaling. The curvature contributes lower-order corrections, and the metric variation $g(t_0-s)$ differs from $g(t_0)$ by $O(s)$, which enters the functional at $O(\\tau)$ and hence does not alter the leading Gaussian structure.\n\nStep 2: Asymptotics of the reduced volume. Using the above, in normal coordinates and parabolic rescaling $x = \\exp_{x_0}(\\sqrt{\\tau}\\,\\xi)$ with $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, we have\n$$\nl(x,\\tau) = \\frac{|\\xi|^2}{4} + o(1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d\\mu_{g(t_0-\\tau)}(x) = \\left(1 + O(\\tau |\\xi|^2) \\right) (\\sqrt{\\tau})^n d\\xi,\n$$\nwhere $d\\xi$ denotes the Euclidean Lebesgue measure expressed via the exponential chart, and the Jacobian of the exponential map in normal coordinates is $1 + O(\\tau|\\xi|^2)$ while the time variation contributes $O(\\tau)$. Thus\n$$\n\\tilde{V}(\\tau) = (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2} \\int_M e^{-l(x,\\tau)} \\, d\\mu_{g(t_0-\\tau)}(x) \\approx (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{|\\xi|^2}{4}\\right) \\left(1 + o(1)\\right) \\, \\tau^{n/2} \\, d\\xi,\n$$\nwhere we used the change of variables $x = \\exp_{x_0}(\\sqrt{\\tau}\\,\\xi)$, so $d\\mu$ carries a factor $\\tau^{n/2}$, and the domain in $\\xi$ expands to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as $\\tau \\to 0^+$. The normalization $(4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2}$ cancels the $\\tau^{n/2}$ from the Jacobian, leaving the standard Gaussian integral. By dominated convergence and the classical Gaussian integral\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{|\\xi|^2}{4}\\right) \\, d\\xi = (4\\pi)^{n/2},\n$$\nwe obtain\n$$\n\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\tilde{V}(\\tau) = (4\\pi)^{-n/2} \\cdot (4\\pi)^{n/2} = 1.\n$$\nThis argument is valid for complete smooth solutions with bounded curvature, as assumed, and relies only on local normal-coordinate expansions and the leading-order Euclidean behavior.\n\nStep 3: Geometric interpretation. The reduced volume $\\tilde{V}(\\tau)$ is a scale-covariant, monotone quantity under the Ricci flow that compares the evolving geometry to the Gaussian geometry of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ at parabolic scale $\\sqrt{\\tau}$. The limit $\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\tilde{V}(\\tau) = 1$ encodes that, near the base point and at very short backward times, the geometry, after parabolic rescaling, looks Euclidean and the weighted measure $e^{-l} d\\mu$ matches the Euclidean Gaussian. Consequently, at sufficiently small scales around $x_0$, there is no local collapsing: volume ratios of balls at scale $\\sqrt{\\tau}$ are comparable to those in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and the tangent flow at the base point is the flat Gaussian model. This is the local manifestation of the non-local-collapsing principle: the reduced volume provides a renormalized measure of local volume that, in the short-time limit, achieves the maximal Euclidean value.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Correct. The derivation above shows $\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\tilde{V}(\\tau) = 1$. The change of variables $x = \\exp_{x_0}(\\sqrt{\\tau}\\,\\xi)$ and the leading-order expression $l \\sim |\\xi|^2/4$ demonstrate that $e^{-l} d\\mu$ converges to the Euclidean Gaussian measure, encoding asymptotically Euclidean geometry at scale $\\sqrt{\\tau}$. This rules out local collapsing at $x_0$ at very small scales, as the renormalized volume matches the Euclidean value.\n\nB. Incorrect. The reduced volume is not the raw volume ratio of geodesic balls; it is an integral of the Gaussian weight $e^{-l}$ with a specific normalization. The limit being $1$ does not require the curvature tensor to vanish identically near $x_0$; it follows from smoothness and the local Euclidean asymptotics. Moreover, the statement about equality if and only if vanishing curvature is false in this short-time limit context.\n\nC. Incorrect. The limit is $1$ for any smooth Ricci flow regardless of global flatness; it is a local short-time property tied to the Euclidean tangent geometry at $x_0$ after parabolic rescaling. It does not detect global flatness of $M$.\n\nD. Incorrect. Noncompactness does not force the limit to be $0$ because the Gaussian weight $e^{-l}$ ensures integrability, and the normalization exactly matches the Gaussian integral yielding the limit $1$. The integral localizes near $x_0$ at scale $\\sqrt{\\tau}$, so infinite volume at infinity is irrelevant to the limit.\n\nE. Incorrect. The existence of the limit $1$ is a local smoothness result and does not require nonnegative Ricci curvature. Bounded curvature and smoothness suffice for the normal-coordinate and parabolic scaling argument to conclude $\\lim_{\\tau \\to 0^+} \\tilde{V}(\\tau) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, only option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3032464"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the reduced volume approaches the Euclidean value of $1$ in the short-time limit, a natural next question is to determine the rate of this convergence.
