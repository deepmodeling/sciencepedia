We will address these sequentially.\n\nFirst, we derive the local expression for $\\omega$ on the chart $U_{0}$. The Fubini–Study form is defined by the curvature of the hyperplane line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ with its induced metric $h_1$. The problem provides the definition of the form as\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2\\pi}\\,\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log h_1.\n$$\nIn the affine chart $U_{0}$ with inhomogeneous coordinates $z_{1}, \\dots, z_{n}$, a local holomorphic frame $s_1$ for $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is chosen such that the metric component is given by the scalar function $H(z, \\bar{z}) = h_1(s_1, s_1) = 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |z_{j}|^{2} = 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} z_{j}\\bar{z}_{j}$.\nOur task is to compute $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2\\pi}\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log H$.

The problem suggests using foundational results, such as Chern–Weil theory. This approach allows us to bypass direct integration, which is considerably more complex.\n\nAccording to Chern-Weil theory, the de Rham cohomology class of the first Chern form $c_{1}(L, h)$ of a Hermitian line bundle $(L,h)$ represents the first Chern class $c_{1}(L) \\in H^{2}(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. The first Chern form is $c_{1}(L,h) = \\frac{i}{2\\pi}F_{A}$, where $F_A$ is the curvature of the Chern connection. In a local holomorphic frame $s$ with metric $h(s,s)=H$, the curvature is $F_A = \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log H$.\nFor our bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ with metric $h_1$ and potential $H=h_1(s_1, s_1)$, the first Chern form is:\n$$\nc_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1), h_{1}) = \\frac{i}{2\\pi} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log H.\n$$\nThe problem defines $\\omega = \\frac{i}{2\\pi}\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log H$. Therefore, we can directly identify $\\omega$ with the first Chern form of the hyperplane bundle:\n$$\n\\omega = c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1), h_{1}).\n$$\nIn terms of cohomology classes, $[\\omega] = c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1))$. The cohomology ring of complex projective space is well known: $H^{*}(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[u] / \\langle u^{n+1} \\rangle$, where $u$ is a generator of $H^{2}(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}, \\mathbb{Z})$. The standard choice for this generator is the first Chern class of the hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, i.e., $u = c_{1}(\\mathcal{O}(1))$.\nThus, we have $[\\omega] = u$. The form $\\omega$ represents the generator of the second integral cohomology group of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$.\n\nThe integral of a top-degree form over a compact manifold depends only on its cohomology class. We need to evaluate $\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega^{n}$. The cohomology class of $\\omega^{n}$ is $[\\omega^{n}] = [\\omega]^{n} = u^{n}$. The integral is therefore\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega^{n} = \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} u^{n}.\n$$\nBy the definition of the intersection pairing in the cohomology of $\\mathbb{CP}^{n}$, the integral of the $n$-th power of the generator over the fundamental cycle $[\\mathbb{CP}^{n}]$ is unity:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} u^{n} = 1.\n$$\nThis result can be understood geometrically: $u$ represents the class of a hyperplane $\\mathbb{CP}^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^{n}$, and $u^n$ represents the intersection of $n$ generic hyperplanes, which is a single point. Integrating this class over the manifold counts the number of points, which is $1$.\n\nHaving established that $\\int_{\\mathbb{PAN}^{n}} \\omega^{n} = 1$, we can now compute the total volume:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}_{\\omega}(\\mathbb{CP}^{n}) = \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{\\mathbb{CP}^{n}} \\omega^{n} = \\frac{1}{n!} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{n!}.\n$$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the total volume as a function of the dimension $n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{n!}}$$", "id": "3030384"}, {"introduction": "The Hermitian-Yang-Mills (HYM) equation, $\\sqrt{-1}\\Lambda_{\\omega} F_{A} = \\mu$, provides a canonical choice of connection by relating a bundle's curvature $F_A$ to the base manifold's Kähler form $\\omega$.

Since $\\mu(L) = \\mu(E)$, the condition $\\mu(S') \\leq \\mu(E)$ holds for all rank-$1$ subbundles. Thus, $E$ is **semistable**.\n\n    -   **Stability**: The condition for stability is that for any proper subbundle $S' \\subset E$, the strict inequality $\\mu(S')  \\mu(E)$ must hold. We have found subbundles, namely the direct summands $S_1$ and $S_2$, for which $\\mu(S_1) = \\mu(S_2) = \\mu(E)$. Since the equality holds, the strict inequality required for stability is violated.
