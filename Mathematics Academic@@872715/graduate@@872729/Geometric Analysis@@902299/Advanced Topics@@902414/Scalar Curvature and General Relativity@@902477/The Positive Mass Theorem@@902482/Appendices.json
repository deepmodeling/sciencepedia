It is a standard problem in geometric analysis and mathematical physics, providing all necessary definitions and conditions. It does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and has a unique, well-defined solution. The problem serves as a fundamental check of the definition of ADM mass for the trivial case of Minkowski spacetime.\n\n**Step 2: Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first is a direct computation of the ADM mass for Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$. The second is an explanation of the result in the context of the positive mass theorem.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the ADM Mass**\n\nWe are given the manifold $M=\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and the metric $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$ in global Cartesian coordinates, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nFirst, we verify that this manifold is asymptotically flat according to the given definition. The condition is that $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} + h_{ij}$ where $h_{ij} \\in o(|x|^{-1})$. In our case, $g_{ij} - \\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} - \\delta_{ij} = 0$. The zero tensor trivially satisfies the condition $h_{ij} \\in o(|x|^{-1})$, since $\\lim_{|x|\\to\\infty} |x| \\|h_{ij}\\| = \\lim_{|x|\\to\\infty} |x| \\cdot 0 = 0$. The first derivatives of the metric components are $\\partial_k g_{ij} = \\partial_k \\delta_{ij} = 0$, which also satisfy the required decay conditions. Thus, $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$ is indeed an asymptotically flat manifold.\n\nNext, we compute the integrand $\\left(\\partial_{j}g_{ij}-\\partial_{i}g_{jj}\\right)$ for the ADM mass formula. The summation convention is used for repeated indices.\nThe metric components $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$ are constant throughout $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThe first term in the integrand is $\\partial_{j}g_{ij}$. Since $g_{ij}$ are constants, their partial derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\partial_{j}g_{ij} = \\partial_{j}\\delta_{ij} = 0\n$$\nThe second term involves the trace of the metric, $g_{jj} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} g_{jj}$.\n$$\ng_{jj} = g_{11} + g_{22} + g_{33} = \\delta_{11} + \\delta_{22} + \\delta_{33} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nThe trace of the metric is the constant $3$. The partial derivative of the trace is therefore zero:\n$$\n\\partial_{i}g_{jj} = \\partial_{i}(3) = 0\n$$\nCombining these results, the expression inside the integral is:\n$$\n\\partial_{j}g_{ij}-\\partial_{i}g_{jj} = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nNow we can evaluate the surface integral over the sphere $S_r$ of radius $r$:\n$$\n\\int_{S_{r}}\\left(\\partial_{j}g_{ij}-\\partial_{i}g_{jj}\\right)\\nu^{i}\\,dA = \\int_{S_{r}} (0) \\nu^{i}\\,dA = 0\n$$\nThe integral is zero for any radius $r$.\n\nFinally, we take the limit as $r \\to \\infty$ to find the ADM mass:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\delta) = \\frac{1}{16\\pi G}\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\int_{S_{r}}\\left(\\partial_{j}g_{ij}-\\partial_{i}g_{jj}\\right)\\nu^{i}\\,dA = \\frac{1}{16\\pi G}\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} 0 = 0\n$$\nThe ADM mass of Euclidean $3$-space is $0$.\n\n**Part 2: Consistency with the Positive Mass Theorem**\n\nThe positive mass theorem (proven by Schoen-Yau and Witten) makes a statement about the ADM mass of certain manifolds. The fundamental statement is as follows:\nLet $(M^{n}, g)$ be a complete, asymptotically flat manifold of dimension $n \\ge 3$ with non-negative scalar curvature $R \\ge 0$. Then its ADM mass is non-negative, $m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(g) \\ge 0$.\nFurthermore, the rigidity part of the theorem states that $m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(g) = 0$ if and only if $(M, g)$ is isometric to the Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\delta)$.\n\nWe must verify that our manifold, $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$, satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem for $n=3$.\n1.  **Completeness:** Standard Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$ is a complete metric space.\n2.  **Asymptotic Flatness:** As verified in Part 1, $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$ is asymptotically flat.\n3.  **Non-negative Scalar Curvature:** For the Euclidean metric $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$, the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ are all zero because the derivatives of the metric components are zero. Consequently, the Riemann curvature tensor $R^{i}{}_{jkl}$ is identically zero. The Ricci tensor $R_{jk}$ is also zero, and therefore the scalar curvature $R = g^{jk}R_{jk}$ is zero. The condition $R \\ge 0$ is satisfied, as $0 \\ge 0$.\n\nSince all hypotheses of the positive mass theorem are satisfied, the theorem applies. The rigidity statement asserts that $m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(g) = 0$ if and only if $(M, g)$ is isometric to $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$. Our manifold is precisely $(\\mathbb{R}^{3}, \\delta)$, so the \"if\" direction of the rigidity statement implies that its ADM mass must be $0$.\n\nOur direct calculation yielded $m_{\\mathrm{ADM}}(\\delta) = 0$. This result is perfectly consistent with, and indeed required by, the rigidity case of the positive mass theorem.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct but related analyses of the given Riemannian manifold $(M^3, g)$. We will address each in turn. The manifold is $M^3 = \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ with the metric $g_{ij} = u^4 \\delta_{ij}$, where $u(x) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2|x|}$ and $m  0$. Here, $r = |x|$.\n\n### 1. Asymptotic Flatness\n\nAn $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is asymptotically flat of order $\\tau  \\frac{n-2}{2}$ if there exists a compact set $K \\subset M$ and a diffeomorphism $\\Phi: M \\setminus K \\to \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus B_R(0)$ for some large ball $B_R(0)$, such that in the coordinates induced by $\\Phi$, the metric components $g_{ij}$ satisfy:\n1.  $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} + O(r^{-\\tau})$\n2.  $\\partial_k g_{ij} = O(r^{-\\tau-1})$\n3.  $\\partial_l \\partial_k g_{ij} = O(r^{-\\tau-2})$\n\nas $r \\to \\infty$. The problem asks to verify this for $n=3$ and order $\\tau=1$.\n\nThe metric components are given by $g_{ij}(x) = (1 + \\frac{m}{2r})^4 \\delta_{ij}$. We analyze the behavior for large $r$.\n\n**Condition 1**: We expand the conformal factor for large $r$:\n$$\n\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^4 = 1 + 4\\left(\\frac{m}{2r}\\right) + 6\\left(\\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^2 + \\dots = 1 + \\frac{2m}{r} + \\frac{3m^2}{2r^2} + O(r^{-3})\n$$\nThus, the metric components are:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\left(1 + \\frac{2m}{r} + O(r^{-2})\\right)\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} + \\frac{2m}{r}\\delta_{ij} + O(r^{-2})\n$$\nSo, $g_{ij} - \\delta_{ij} = O(r^{-1})$. This satisfies the first condition for $\\tau=1$.\n\n**Condition 2**: We compute the first partial derivatives of the metric components. Let $f(r) = (1 + \\frac{m}{2r})^4$.\n$$\n\\partial_k g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} \\partial_k f(r) = \\delta_{ij} \\frac{df}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^k}\n$$\nWe have $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^k} = \\frac{x_k}{r}$. The derivative of $f(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dr} = 4\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^3 \\left(-\\frac{m}{2r^2}\\right) = -\\frac{2m}{r^2}\\left(1 + O(r^{-1})\\right) = O(r^{-2})\n$$\nSo, the partial derivative of the metric is:\n$$\n\\partial_k g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} \\left(-\\frac{2m}{r^2} + O(r^{-3})\\right) \\frac{x_k}{r} = -\\frac{2m x_k}{r^3}\\delta_{ij} + O(r^{-4})\n$$\nSince $|x_k| \\le r$, the magnitude of this term is bounded by a multiple of $r/r^3 = r^{-2}$. Thus, $\\partial_k g_{ij} = O(r^{-2})$. This satisfies the second condition for $\\tau=1$.\n\n**Condition 3**: We compute the second partial derivatives.\n$$\n\\partial_l \\partial_k g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} \\partial_l \\left( \\frac{df}{dr} \\frac{x_k}{r} \\right) = \\delta_{ij} \\left( \\frac{d^2f}{dr^2} \\frac{x_l}{r} \\frac{x_k}{r} + \\frac{df}{dr} \\left( \\frac{\\delta_{kl}}{r} - \\frac{x_k x_l}{r^3} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nWe need the second derivative of $f(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dr^2} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ -\\frac{2m}{r^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right)^3 \\right] = \\frac{4m}{r^3}\\left(1 + O(r^{-1})\\right) + O(r^{-4}) = O(r^{-3})\n$$\nSubstituting the orders of magnitude:\n$$\n\\partial_l \\partial_k g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij} \\left( O(r^{-3}) O(1) + O(r^{-2}) O(r^{-1}) \\right) = O(r^{-3})\n$$\nThis satisfies the third condition for $\\tau=1$.\nTherefore, the metric $g$ is asymptotically flat of order $1$.\n\n### 2. ADM Mass Calculation\n\nThe ADM mass for an asymptotically flat $3$-manifold is defined by the limit of a surface integral (with $c=1$):\n$$\nm_{\\text{ADM}} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi G} \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\oint_{S_R} \\sum_{i,j=1}^3 (\\partial_j g_{ij} - \\partial_i g_{ii}) \\nu^i dS\n$$\nwhere $S_R$ is a coordinate sphere of radius $R$, $\\partial_i$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^i$, $\\nu^i = x^i/R$ is the outward unit normal vector to $S_R$ in the background Euclidean metric, and $dS$ is the surface element of $S_R$ in the Euclidean metric. Note that indices are raised and lowered with the Euclidean metric $\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nLet's compute the terms in the integrand.\nThe metric components are $g_{ij} = u^4 \\delta_{ij}$.\nThe trace of the metric is $g_{ii} = \\sum_i g_{ii} = g_{11} + g_{22} + g_{33} = u^4 + u^4 + u^4 = 3u^4$.\nIts derivative is:\n$$\n\\partial_i g_{ii} = \\partial_i(3u^4) = 12u^3 \\partial_i u\n$$\nWe know $\\partial_i u = \\partial_i(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}) = \\frac{m}{2} \\partial_i(r^{-1}) = \\frac{m}{2}(-r^{-2})\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x^i} = -\\frac{m}{2r^2}\\frac{x_i}{r} = -\\frac{mx_i}{2r^3}$.\nSo, $\\partial_i g_{ii} = 12u^3 (-\\frac{mx_i}{2r^3}) = -\\frac{6mu^3 x_i}{r^3}$.\n\nNext, we compute the divergence term $\\sum_j \\partial_j g_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^3 \\partial_j g_{ij} = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\partial_j (u^4 \\delta_{ij}) = \\sum_{j=1}^3 (4u^3 (\\partial_j u) \\delta_{ij}) = 4u^3 (\\partial_i u)\n$$\n(The summation over $j$ picks out the $i$-th component because of the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$).\nSubstituting $\\partial_i u$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^3 \\partial_j g_{ij} = 4u^3 \\left(-\\frac{mx_i}{2r^3}\\right) = -\\frac{2mu^3 x_i}{r^3}\n$$\nNow we combine the two terms inside the integral (note the indices in the formula: $(\\partial_j g_{ij} - \\partial_i g_{jj}) \\nu^i$):\n$$\n\\sum_j \\partial_j g_{ij} - \\partial_i g_{jj} = \\left(-\\frac{2mu^3 x_i}{r^3}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{6mu^3 x_i}{r^3}\\right) = \\frac{4mu^3 x_i}{r^3}\n$$\nThe full integrand, before integrating, is the scalar product of this vector with the normal vector $\\nu^i = x^i/R$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 (\\sum_j \\partial_j g_{ij} - \\partial_i g_{jj}) \\nu^i = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\left(\\frac{4mu^3 x_i}{r^3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x_i}{R}\\right) = \\frac{4mu^3}{r^3 R} \\sum_{i=1}^3 (x_i)^2 = \\frac{4mu^3}{r^3 R} r^2 = \\frac{4mu^3}{rR}\n$$\nWe evaluate this on the sphere $S_R$, so we set $r=R$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{4mu^3}{rR} \\right|_{r=R} = \\frac{4m u(R)^3}{R^2}\n$$\nwhere $u(R) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2R}$. This expression is constant on the sphere $S_R$. The integral is the value of the integrand multiplied by the surface area of the Euclidean sphere, which is $4\\pi R^2$:\n$$\n\\oint_{S_R} \\dots dS = \\left(\\frac{4m u(R)^3}{R^2}\\right) (4\\pi R^2) = 16\\pi m u(R)^3\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ADM mass by taking the limit as $R \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nm_{\\text{ADM}} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi G} \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\left(16\\pi m u(R)^3\\right) = \\frac{m}{G} \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2R}\\right)^3\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\frac{m}{2R} = 0$, we have:\n$$\nm_{\\text{ADM}} = \\frac{m}{G} \\cdot (1+0)^3 = \\frac{m}{G}\n$$\nThe problem statement notes that the parameter $m$ is related to the physical mass $M$ by $m=GM$. Substituting this gives $m_{ADM} = GM/G = M$, confirming the ADM mass is the physical mass $M$. The question asks for the answer in terms of the parameter $m$.\n\n### 3. Vanishing Scalar Curvature\n\nThe scalar curvature $R_g$ of a metric $g = \\psi^{\\frac{4}{n-2}}\\delta$ on an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is given by the formula:\n$$\nR_g = -\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\psi^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\Delta_\\delta \\psi\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_\\delta$ is the Euclidean Laplacian.\nIn our case, $n=3$, so the metric has the form $g = \\psi^4 \\delta$. By comparison with the given metric $g=u^4 \\delta$, we identify $\\psi=u$. The formula for the scalar curvature becomes:\n$$\nR_g = -\\frac{4(3-1)}{3-2} u^{-\\frac{3+2}{3-2}} \\Delta_\\delta u = -8 u^{-5} \\Delta_\\delta u\n$$\nTo show that $R_g=0$, we must show that $u(x)$ is a harmonic function on the domain $M^3 = \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, i.e., $\\Delta_\\delta u = 0$.\nThe function is $u(x) = 1 + \\frac{m}{2r}$, where $r=|x|$. The Euclidean Laplacian in spherical coordinates is $\\Delta_\\delta = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}) + \\text{angular parts}$. Since $u$ depends only on $r$, the angular parts vanish.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{2r}\\right) = -\\frac{m}{2r^2}\n$$\nNow we compute $\\Delta_\\delta u$:\n$$\n\\Delta_\\delta u = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2 \\left(-\\frac{m}{2r^2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(-\\frac{m}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2}(0) = 0\n$$\nThis calculation is valid for all $r \\neq 0$, which corresponds to the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Since $\\Delta_\\delta u = 0$ on this domain, the scalar curvature is:\n$$\nR_g = -8 u^{-5} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe scalar curvature of the metric $g$ vanishes on its entire domain $M^3$.

Compute energy integral:\n   $$M_{ADM}=\\frac1{4\\pi G}\\int|\\nabla u|_g^2\\,dV_g\n     =\\frac1G\\int_a^\\infty\\Psi^2(u')^2\\rho^2\\,d\\rho\n     =\\frac1G\\int_a^\\infty\\frac{(2a)^2}{(\\rho+a)^2}d\\rho\n     =\\frac{4a^2}{G}\\Bigl[-\\frac1{\\rho+a}\\Bigr]_a^\\infty\n     =\\frac{4a^2}{G}\\,\\frac1{2a}\n     =\\frac{2a}{G}\n     =M.$$\n6. Therefore the integral equals the mass parameter $M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{M}$$", "id": "919707"}]}
