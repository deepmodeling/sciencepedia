## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the Reilly formula as a potent integral identity derived from the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula and the divergence theorem. While its derivation is an exercise in fundamental [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818), its true power is revealed in its applications. This chapter explores how the Reilly formula serves as a versatile and incisive tool, bridging the gap between the local analysis of [partial differential equations](@entry_id:143134) and the global geometry of manifolds. We will demonstrate its utility in three principal arenas: the [spectral geometry](@entry_id:186460) of the Laplacian, the derivation of sharp [geometric inequalities](@entry_id:197381) and [rigidity theorems](@entry_id:198222) for domains, and the modern theory of [geometric stability](@entry_id:193596) and metric convergence. Throughout these applications, a common theme emerges: the Reilly formula quantitatively links the geometry of a manifold and its boundary to the analytic behavior of functions defined upon it, allowing geometric information to be extracted from analytic assumptions, and vice versa.

### Applications in Spectral Geometry

One of the most fruitful applications of the Reilly formula and its underlying principles is in [spectral geometry](@entry_id:186460), the study of the relationship between the spectrum of differential operators, such as the Laplace-Beltrami operator $-\Delta$, and the geometry of the underlying manifold. The eigenvalues of $-\Delta$ are fundamental [geometric invariants](@entry_id:178611), and establishing bounds on them is a central goal.

The integrated Bochner identity, from which the Reilly formula is derived, proves particularly powerful when applied to an [eigenfunction](@entry_id:149030) $u$ of the Laplacian, satisfying $-\Delta u = \lambda u$. On a compact manifold $(M^n, g)$ with a smooth boundary $\partial M$, the Reilly formula relates an integral over $M$ involving curvature to a boundary integral involving the [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454) $\mathrm{II}$ and mean curvature $H$. The precise form of this boundary integral is sensitive to the boundary conditions imposed on the [eigenfunction](@entry_id:149030) $u$.

For an eigenfunction, the general boundary term can be expressed in terms of its normal derivative $\partial_\nu u$ and tangential gradient $\nabla_T u$. For the two most common boundary conditions, the term simplifies significantly. Under a Neumann boundary condition ($\partial_\nu u = 0$), the boundary integral reduces to $\int_{\partial M} \mathrm{II}(\nabla_T u, \nabla_T u) \,dA$. If the boundary is convex (i.e., $\mathrm{II} \ge 0$), this term is non-negative. Under a Dirichlet boundary condition ($u=0$), the tangential gradient $\nabla_T u$ vanishes, and the boundary integral becomes $\int_{\partial M} H (\partial_\nu u)^2 \,dA$. If the boundary is [mean-convex](@entry_id:193370) ($H \ge 0$), this term is also non-negative. This non-negativity is the crucial observation that allows for the extension of powerful eigenvalue estimates from closed manifolds to [manifolds with boundary](@entry_id:159788) [@problem_id:3035919].

A classic result for closed manifolds, the Lichnerowicz-Obata theorem, states that if a closed manifold $(M^n, g)$ has Ricci curvature $\operatorname{Ric} \ge (n-1)g$, then the first nonzero eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian satisfies $\lambda_1 \ge n$. The Reilly formula permits a direct analogue for [manifolds with boundary](@entry_id:159788). Consider a [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) $(M^n, g)$ with a convex boundary and Ricci curvature $\operatorname{Ric} \ge (n-1)g$. Applying the Reilly formula to a first Neumann eigenfunction $u$ and using the non-negativity of the boundary term, one can follow the logic of the Lichnerowicz argument to establish the sharp lower bound $\lambda_1 \ge n$.

Furthermore, the Reilly formula provides insight into the rigidity of this inequality. For equality to hold, i.e., $\lambda_1 = n$, all inequalities in the derivation must become equalities. This forces the boundary term $\int_{\partial M} \mathrm{II}(\nabla_T u, \nabla_T u) \,dA$ to be zero, and it forces the [eigenfunction](@entry_id:149030) to satisfy the equation $\nabla^2 u = -u g$ in the interior. This [overdetermined system](@entry_id:150489) of equations has a unique solution (up to isometries), constraining the geometry of the manifold itself. The conclusion is a powerful rigidity theorem: a manifold with a convex boundary and $\operatorname{Ric} \ge (n-1)g$ has $\lambda_1 = n$ if and only if it is isometric to the standard hemisphere $S^n_+$ with its [totally geodesic](@entry_id:183906) boundary [@problem_id:3036313].

A parallel story unfolds for the Dirichlet problem. For a domain $\Omega$ in the standard sphere $S^n$, one can prove that if the boundary $\partial \Omega$ has non-negative mean curvature, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\Omega)$ satisfies $\lambda_1(\Omega) \ge n$. The rigidity case is again informative. The standard hemisphere $B$, whose boundary is a [totally geodesic](@entry_id:183906) equator (and thus has zero [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147)), is a domain where this bound is achieved. Indeed, one can explicitly construct the first [eigenfunction](@entry_id:149030) on the hemisphere—it is simply the restriction of a coordinate function of the ambient Euclidean space—and verify that its eigenvalue is exactly $n$. This demonstrates that the hemisphere is the rigid model for this particular spectral inequality, a fact rigorously established through Reilly-type arguments [@problem_id:3036308].

### Geometric Inequalities and Rigidity of Domains

Shifting focus from abstract manifolds to domains in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where the Ricci curvature is identically zero, the Reilly formula becomes a powerful tool for proving [geometric inequalities](@entry_id:197381) involving the boundary of a domain. In this context, the formula connects the boundary mean curvature $H$ to the geometry of the domain itself.

A prototypical application is the proof of the Heintze-Karcher inequality. Consider a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with a smooth, strictly [mean-convex](@entry_id:193370) boundary $\Sigma = \partial\Omega$. To probe its geometry, one can introduce an auxiliary function, typically the solution to a Poisson problem such as $\Delta u = n$ in $\Omega$ with a Dirichlet condition $u=0$ on $\Sigma$. For such a function, the Reilly formula takes the form:
$$
\int_{\Omega} \big( n^2 - |\nabla^2 u|^2 \big) \,dV = \int_{\Sigma} H (\partial_\nu u)^2 \,dA
$$
The left-hand side can be bounded above using the fundamental algebraic inequality $|\nabla^2 u|^2 \ge \frac{1}{n}(\Delta u)^2$, which gives $\int_{\Omega} (n^2 - |\nabla^2 u|^2) \,dV \le n(n-1)|\Omega|$. The boundary integral on the right-hand side can be related to the integral of $1/H$ via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, using the fact from the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271) that $\int_{\Sigma} \partial_\nu u \,dA = \int_\Omega \Delta u \,dV = n|\Omega|$. Combining these steps meticulously yields the Heintze-Karcher inequality:
$$
\int_{\Sigma} \frac{1}{H} \,dA \ge n |\Omega|
$$
(Note: The problem context in `3025650` and `3035566` involves $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and a factor of $n+1$, while `3035606` involves $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a factor of $n$. We adopt the notation of the formula's dimension $n$ for consistency in our chapter's narrative.)

As with spectral estimates, analyzing the equality case is profoundly revealing. Equality in the Heintze-Karcher inequality can hold only if equality holds in both the Hessian inequality and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality used in its proof. Equality in the former forces $\nabla^2 u$ to be a multiple of the metric, specifically $\nabla^2 u = g$. In Euclidean space, this implies that $u$ must be a quadratic polynomial of the form $u(x) = \frac{1}{2}|x - x_0|^2 + c$. The boundary condition $u=0$ then forces $\Sigma$ to be a sphere. This remarkable conclusion—that only spheres achieve equality—showcases the Reilly formula's role as a cornerstone of modern [rigidity theory](@entry_id:180985) [@problem_id:3025650]. The general form of the formula, valid for any [smooth function](@entry_id:158037) $u$ with $\Delta u=f$ and $u=0$ on the boundary, stands as a fundamental tool from which such applications are derived [@problem_id:3035603].

### Stability and Almost-Rigidity Theorems

Rigidity theorems characterize geometric objects that perfectly satisfy the equality condition of an inequality. A deeper and more modern question is that of stability, or "almost-rigidity": if a geometric object *almost* satisfies the equality condition, must it be geometrically *close* to the rigid model? The Reilly formula and its associated proof techniques are central to answering such questions affirmatively.

Consider the stability of the Heintze-Karcher inequality. If the Heintze-Karcher deficit, $\delta_{\mathrm{HK}}(\Sigma)$, which measures the gap in the inequality, is small, one expects the boundary $\Sigma$ to be close to a sphere. The notion of "closeness" can be made precise in several ways. One way is to measure the deviation of $\Sigma$ from being umbilical at every point. A sphere is characterized by its [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454) being a pure trace, i.e., $A = \frac{H}{n}g$. The traceless part, $\mathring{A} = A - \frac{H}{n}g$, is therefore a measure of non-sphericity. A careful analysis of the proof of the Heintze-Karcher inequality, either through the PDE method involving Reilly's formula or a comparison method using parallel surfaces, reveals that the deficit $\delta_{\mathrm{HK}}(\Sigma)$ controls the $L^2$-norm of $\mathring{A}$. A small deficit implies that the surface is almost umbilical in an integral sense. After appropriate normalization to account for scaling, one can establish a quantitative estimate of the form $\|\mathring{A}\|_{L^2(\Sigma)} \le C(n) \varepsilon^{1/2}$ for a small deficit $\varepsilon$. This provides a powerful stability result, confirming that nearly optimal domains are indeed nearly spherical [@problem_id:3035606].

This stability can be extended to a much stronger form of [geometric convergence](@entry_id:201608). By combining the almost-umbilicity control derived from a small Heintze-Karcher deficit with deep results from [regularity theory](@entry_id:194071) (like Allard's theorem) and compactness theorems for convex bodies (like the Blaschke selection theorem), one can prove a remarkable result. A sequence of convex domains $\Omega_k$ whose boundaries have a deficit tending to zero will, after normalization, converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a Euclidean ball. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance provides a global measure of metric similarity. Proving this requires constructing an almost-isometry between the domain $\Omega_k$ and a ball, a construction made possible by the high-order geometric control ($C^{1,\alpha}$-closeness of the boundary to a sphere) that ultimately traces back to the initial analytic estimate on the traceless [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454). This connects the Reilly formula to the [large-scale structure](@entry_id:158990) of [metric spaces](@entry_id:138860) [@problem_id:3035566].

This theme of stability extends to [spectral geometry](@entry_id:186460). Obata's rigidity theorem is a perfect candidate for a stability analysis. Consider a sequence of closed manifolds $(M_i, g_i)$ with Ricci curvature $\operatorname{Ric} \ge (n-1)g_i$ whose first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(M_i)$ approaches the sharp lower bound $n$. The proof of the Lichnerowicz estimate shows that the "spectral gap" $\lambda_1(M_i) - n$ is precisely equal to an integral of terms measuring the failure of the manifold to be the sphere and the failure of the eigenfunction to satisfy the Hessian equation $\nabla^2 u = -u g$. If $\lambda_1(M_i) \to n$, these integral error terms must vanish. This "almost-rigidity in an integral sense" is the crucial input for the powerful Cheeger-Colding [almost rigidity](@entry_id:180460) theory. Combined with Gromov's [compactness theorem](@entry_id:148512) for spaces with a lower Ricci [curvature bound](@entry_id:634453), this theory allows one to conclude that the sequence of manifolds must converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to the [model space](@entry_id:637948), the unit sphere $S^n$. The Reilly-Bochner technique provides the analytic key that unlocks this profound [geometric convergence](@entry_id:201608) theorem, illustrating a deep interplay between analysis, geometry, and the modern theory of metric [limit spaces](@entry_id:636945) [@problem_id:3036342].

In conclusion, the Reilly formula is far more than a mere curiosity of vector [calculus on manifolds](@entry_id:270207). It is a foundational principle that, when applied with judicious choices of functions and in various geometric settings, yields a rich harvest of results. From providing sharp bounds on fundamental [geometric invariants](@entry_id:178611) and characterizing canonical spaces like spheres and hemispheres, to grounding the modern and powerful theories of [geometric stability](@entry_id:193596), the Reilly formula exemplifies the deep and beautiful unity of [geometric analysis](@entry_id:157700).
