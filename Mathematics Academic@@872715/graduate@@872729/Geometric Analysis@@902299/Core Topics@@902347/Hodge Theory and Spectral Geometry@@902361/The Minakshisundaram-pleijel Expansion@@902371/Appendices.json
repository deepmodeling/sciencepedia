This \"confining\" effect increases the probability of heat returning to its origin, resulting in a positive correction term $a_1(x)t$.\n-   If $R(x)0$ (like on a hyperbolic surface), the volume expands faster, so heat spreads out more readily, decreasing the return probability and leading to a negative correction.\nThus, scalar curvature is precisely the local geometric quantity that governs the leading-order deviation of diffusion from the Euclidean case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}R(x)}$$", "id": "3036116"}, {"introduction": "The power of the heat kernel expansion extends beyond closed manifolds to the physically and mathematically rich context of domains with boundaries.
