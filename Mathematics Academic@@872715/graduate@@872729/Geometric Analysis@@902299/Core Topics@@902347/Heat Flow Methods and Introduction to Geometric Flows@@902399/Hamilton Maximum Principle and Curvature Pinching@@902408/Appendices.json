The solution process will now be executed.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Scalar Curvature Evolution Equation\n\nThe evolution of the scalar curvature under Ricci flow is a standard result derived from the variation of the scalar curvature with respect to the metric. Let $g(t)$ be a path of metrics and let $h_{ij} = \\partial_t g_{ij}$. The general formula for the variation of the scalar curvature $R$ is:\n$$ \\partial_t R = -\\Delta(\\text{tr}_g h) + \\text{div}(\\text{div} h) - \\langle h, \\mathrm{Ric} \\rangle_g $$\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the positive Laplace-Beltrami operator, $\\text{div}$ is the divergence operator, and the inner product is the standard one on symmetric 2-tensors.\n\nFor the Ricci flow, we have $h_{ij} = -2 \\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}$. We compute each term in the formula:\n1.  **Trace term**: The trace of $h$ is $\\text{tr}_g h = g^{ij}h_{ij} = g^{ij}(-2\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}) = -2R$.\n2.  **Divergence terms**: First, we find the divergence of the tensor $h$. We work with the contravariant form $h^{ij} = g^{ik}g^{jl}h_{kl} = g^{ik}g^{jl}(-2\\mathrm{Ric}_{kl}) = -2\\mathrm{Ric}^{ij}$. The divergence is a vector with components $(\\text{div} h)^i = \\nabla_j h^{ji}$. Using the contracted second Bianchi identity, $\\nabla_j \\mathrm{Ric}^{ji} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^i R$, we get:\n    $$ (\\text{div} h)^i = \\nabla_j (-2\\mathrm{Ric}^{ji}) = -2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^i R\\right) = -\\nabla^i R $$\n    The double divergence is the divergence of this vector field:\n    $$ \\text{div}(\\text{div} h) = \\nabla_i (\\text{div} h)^i = \\nabla_i(-\\nabla^i R) = -\\Delta R $$\n3.  **Inner product term**: The inner product of $h$ and the Ricci tensor is:\n    $$ \\langle h, \\mathrm{Ric} \\rangle_g = h_{ij}\\mathrm{Ric}^{ij} = (-2\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij})\\mathrm{Ric}^{ij} = -2|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 $$\n\nSubstituting these three results back into the variation formula yields:\n$$ \\partial_t R = -\\Delta(-2R) + (-\\Delta R) - (-2|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2) $$\n$$ \\partial_t R = 2\\Delta R - \\Delta R + 2|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 $$\n$$ \\partial_t R = \\Delta R + 2|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 $$\nThis is the desired scalar curvature evolution equation.\n\n### Part 2: Application of the Maximum Principle\n\nWe have the evolution equation for scalar curvature, which is a parabolic PDE:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} R = \\Delta R + 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}|^{2}\n$$\nLet $m(t) = \\min_{x \\in M} R(x,t)$. By the compactness of $M$, for any time $t$, there exists at least one point $x_t \\in M$ where this minimum is achieved, i.e., $R(x_t, t) = m(t)$.\nAt such a point of spatial minimum $x_t$, we have the following conditions on the spatial derivatives of $R$:\n1. The gradient vanishes: $\\nabla R(x_t, t) = 0$.\n2. The Hessian is positive semi-definite: $\\nabla^2 R(x_t, t) \\ge 0$.\nThe Laplacian, being the trace of the Hessian, is therefore non-negative: $\\Delta R(x_t, t) = g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\nabla_j R(x_t, t) \\ge 0$.\n\nHamilton's maximum principle for parabolic equations states that at a point $(x_t, t)$ where the spatial minimum is achieved, the time derivative of the minimum function $m(t)$ satisfies:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} m(t) \\ge \\partial_t R(x_t, t) = \\Delta R(x_t, t) + 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}(x_t, t)|^{2}\n$$\nwhere the inequality holds in the sense of forward difference quotients, and for almost every $t$.\nUsing $\\Delta R(x_t, t) \\ge 0$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} m(t) \\ge 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}(x_t, t)|^{2}\n$$\nNow we use the provided curvature pinching estimate, $|\\mathrm{Ric}|^{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{n} R^{2}$. At the point $x_t$, we have $R(x_t, t) = m(t)$, so:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{Ric}(x_t, t)|^{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{n} R(x_t, t)^{2} = \\frac{1}{n} m(t)^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our inequality for $\\frac{d}{dt}m(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} m(t) \\ge \\frac{2}{n} m(t)^{2}\n$$\nThis is the differential inequality that governs the evolution of the spatial minimum of the scalar curvature.\n\n### Part 3: Solving for the Lower Barrier Function\n\nWe seek the optimal monotone lower barrier function $b(t)$ by solving the ordinary differential equation (ODE) corresponding to the inequality derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{db}{dt} = \\frac{2}{n} b^{2}\n$$\nwith the initial condition $b(0) = m_0$. This is a separable first-order ODE.\nAssuming $b \\ne 0$, we can separate variables:\n$$\n\\frac{db}{b^{2}} = \\frac{2}{n} dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from $t=0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{b(0)}^{b(t)} \\frac{d\\beta}{\\beta^{2}} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{2}{n} d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\right]_{m_0}^{b(t)} = \\left[ \\frac{2}{n} \\tau \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{b(t)} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{m_0}\\right) = \\frac{2}{n} t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{b(t)} + \\frac{1}{m_0} = \\frac{2t}{n}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $b(t)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{b(t)} = \\frac{2t}{n} - \\frac{1}{m_0} = \\frac{2m_0 t - n}{n m_0}\n$$\n$$\nb(t) = -\\frac{n m_0}{2m_0 t - n} = \\frac{n m_0}{n - 2m_0 t}\n$$\nThis solution is valid provided $m_0 \\ne 0$. If $m_0 = 0$, the ODE $\\frac{db}{dt} = \\frac{2}{n}b^2$ with $b(0)=0$ has the unique solution $b(t)=0$ for all $t$. Our formula gives $b(t) = \\frac{0}{n-0} = 0$, so it holds for $m_0 = 0$ as well.\n\nBy the comparison principle for ODEs, since $m(0) = b(0)$ and $\\frac{dm}{dt} \\ge \\frac{2}{n}m^2$ while $\\frac{db}{dt} = \\frac{2}{n}b^2$, we have $m(t) \\ge b(t)$ for all $t \\in [0, T)$. Thus, $b(t)$ is indeed a lower barrier function for the minimum scalar curvature.\n\nThe explicit closed-form expression for the optimal monotone lower barrier function is:\n$$\nb(t) = \\frac{n m_{0}}{n - 2 m_{0} t}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n m_{0}}{n - 2 m_{0} t}}$$", "id": "3029549"}, {"introduction": "To extend the maximum principle from scalars to tensors, we must analyze the evolution at the boundary of a desired convex set of operators.

This is a contraction of the $(0,2)$-tensor $S$ with the vector $v$. To better understand this, we use the associated self-adjoint $(1,1)$-tensor $A$, defined by $S(u,w) = g(Au, w)$. In component form, this relation is:\n$$\nS_{ij} u^i w^j = g_{kl} (Au)^k w^l = g_{kl} (A^k_i u^i) w^l\n$$\nBy relabeling the index $l$ to $j$, we have $S_{ij} u^i w^j = g_{kj} A^k_i u^i w^j$. Since this must hold for all vectors $u$ and $w$, we can equate the components:\n$$\nS_{ij} = g_{kj} A^k_i\n$$\nLet's now consider the vector $y = Av$. Its contravariant components are $y^k = A^k_i v^i$. Its covariant components are $y_k = g_{kl} y^l = g_{kl} A^l_i v^i$.\nUsing the relation $S_{ij} = g_{kj} A^k_i$, our term $S_{ik} v^i$ becomes:\n$$\nS_{ik} v^i = (g_{jk} A^j_i) v^i = g_{jk} (A^j_i v^i) = g_{jk} y^j = y_k\n$$\nSo, the expression $S_{ik} v^i$ represents the $k$-th covariant component of the vector $y=Av$. We can denote this by $(Av)_k$. Similarly, $S_{lj} v^j = (Av)_l$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our main expression, we get:\n$$\n\\langle Q(S), v \\otimes v \\rangle = g^{kl}\\, (Av)_k\\, (Av)_l\n$$\nThis expression is the squared norm of the vector $Av$ with respect to the metric $g$:\n$$\ng^{kl}\\, (Av)_k\\, (Av)_l = g(Av, Av) = \\|Av\\|^2_g\n$$\nThus, the problem reduces to computing the value of $g(Av, Av)$ given the hypotheses.\n\nThe hypotheses are:\n1. $S$ is nonnegative definite at $p$, meaning $S(u,u) \\ge 0$ for all $u \\in T_p M$. In terms of the operator $A$, this is $g(Au, u) \\ge 0$. This implies that $A$ is a nonnegative definite operator. Since $S$ is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor, the associated operator $A$ is self-adjoint with respect to $g$.\n2. We are given a nonzero vector $v \\in T_p M$ such that $S(v,v) = 0$. This translates to $g(Av, v) = 0$.\n\nNow we must use these facts. Let $A$ be a nonnegative definite, self-adjoint operator on the finite-dimensional real inner product space $(T_p M, g)$. Because $A$ is nonnegative definite and self-adjoint, it admits a unique nonnegative definite, self-adjoint square root, which we will call $B$, such that $A = B^2$.\nUsing this decomposition, the condition $g(Av, v) = 0$ can be rewritten:\n$$\ng(B^2v, v) = g(B(Bv), v) = 0\n$$\nSince $B$ is self-adjoint, we can move it to the other argument of the inner product:\n$$\ng(Bv, Bv) = 0\n$$\nThis is the definition of the squared norm of the vector $Bv$:\n$$\n\\|Bv\\|^2_g = 0\n$$\nFor a positive-definite inner product such as a Riemannian metric, the norm of a vector is zero if and only if the vector itself is the zero vector. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\nBv = 0\n$$\nNow we can evaluate $Av$:\n$$\nAv = B(Bv) = B(0) = 0\n$$\nThe condition $g(Av, v) = 0$ for a nonnegative definite self-adjoint operator $A$ implies that $v$ is in the kernel of $A$.\n\nFinally, the quantity we set out to compute is $g(Av, Av)$. Since we have rigorously established that $Av=0$, the computation is trivial:\n$$\ng(Av, Av) = g(0, 0) = 0\n$$\nThe value of the scalar is therefore $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3029506"}, {"introduction": "We now arrive at a pinnacle application of the tensor maximum principle: proving the invariance of a pinched curvature condition in dimension three.

It's more convenient to express this as $|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 = 2(\\mu_1^2+\\mu_2^2+\\mu_3^2) + 2(\\mu_1\\mu_2+\\mu_2\\mu_3+\\mu_3\\mu_1)$.\n$|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 = 2\\mu_1^2 + 2(\\mu_2^2+\\mu_3^2) + 2\\mu_1(\\mu_2+\\mu_3) + 2\\mu_2\\mu_3 = 2\\mu_1^2 + 2(x^2-2y) + 2\\mu_1 x + 2y = 2\\mu_1^2 + 2x^2 - 2y + 2\\mu_1 x$.\nThe inequality is:\n$$ \\mu_1^2 + y + \\epsilon \\left( 2\\mu_1^2 + 2x^2 - 2y + 2\\mu_1 x \\right) \\ge 0 $$\n$$ \\mu_1^2(1+2\\epsilon) + y(1-2\\epsilon) + 2\\epsilon(x^2 + \\mu_1 x) \\ge 0 $$\nSubstitute $\\mu_1(1+2\\epsilon) = -2\\epsilon x$:\n$$ \\mu_1(-2\\epsilon x) + y(1-2\\epsilon) + 2\\epsilon(x^2 + \\mu_1 x) \\ge 0 $$\n$$ -2\\epsilon \\mu_1 x + y(1-2\\epsilon) + 2\\epsilon x^2 + 2\\epsilon \\mu_1 x \\ge 0 $$\n$$ 2\\epsilon x^2 + (1-2\\epsilon)y \\ge 0 $$\nSubstituting back $x=\\mu_2+\\mu_3$ and $y=\\mu_2\\mu_3$, the final condition is:\n$$ 2\\epsilon (\\mu_2+\\mu_3)^2 + (1-2\\epsilon)\\mu_2\\mu_3 \\ge 0 $$\nFor the cone $\\mathcal{C}_\\epsilon$ to be invariant, this inequality must hold for any values of $\\mu_2$ and $\\mu_3$ that can arise at a boundary point. At the chosen point, there are no further constraints on the sectional curvatures $\\mu_2, \\mu_3$. Thus, the quadratic form in variables $\\mu_2, \\mu_3$ on the left must be positive semi-definite.\nLet us homogenize by setting $\\mu_3 = t\\mu_2$. For $\\mu_2 \\ne 0$, the inequality becomes:\n$$ 2\\epsilon \\mu_2^2(1+t)^2 + (1-2\\epsilon)t\\mu_2^2 \\ge 0 \\implies 2\\epsilon(1+t)^2 + (1-2\\epsilon)t \\ge 0 $$\n$$ 2\\epsilon(1+2t+t^2) + t - 2\\epsilon t \\ge 0 $$\n$$ 2\\epsilon t^2 + (4\\epsilon+1-2\\epsilon)t + 2\\epsilon \\ge 0 $$\n$$ 2\\epsilon t^2 + (1+2\\epsilon)t + 2\\epsilon \\ge 0 $$\nFor this quadratic polynomial in $t$ to be non-negative for all real $t$, its discriminant must be less than or equal to zero. Also, the leading coefficient $2\\epsilon$ must be non-negative, so $\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\n$$ D = (1+2\\epsilon)^2 - 4(2\\epsilon)(2\\epsilon) \\le 0 $$\n$$ (1+4\\epsilon+4\\epsilon^2) - 16\\epsilon^2 \\le 0 $$\n$$ 1+4\\epsilon-12\\epsilon^2 \\le 0 $$\n$$ 12\\epsilon^2 - 4\\epsilon - 1 \\ge 0 $$\nThe roots of the quadratic equation $12\\epsilon^2 - 4\\epsilon - 1 = 0$ are:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(12)(-1)}}{2(12)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16+48}}{24} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{24} = \\frac{4 \\pm 8}{24} $$\nThe roots are $\\epsilon_1 = \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\epsilon_2 = \\frac{-4}{24} = -\\frac{1}{6}$.\nSince the parabola $f(\\epsilon)=12\\epsilon^2-4\\epsilon-1$ opens upwards, the inequality $f(\\epsilon) \\ge 0$ is satisfied for $\\epsilon \\in (-\\infty, -1/6] \\cup [1/2, \\infty)$.\nCombined with the condition $\\epsilon \\ge 0$, the solution set is $[1/2, \\infty)$.\nThe problem asks for the smallest $\\epsilon^*$ such that the cone $\\mathcal{C}_\\epsilon$ is invariant for all $\\epsilon \\ge \\epsilon^*$. This requires the interval $[\\epsilon^*, \\infty)$ to be the solution set we just found.\nThe smallest such value is therefore $\\epsilon^* = 1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3029543"}]}
