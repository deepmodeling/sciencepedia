We proceed by contradiction.\n\nAssume that $u_d$ is smooth throughout the entire domain $B^3$. The domain $B^3$ is a contractible topological space. A well-known result in algebraic topology states that any continuous map from a contractible space to any other topological space is null-homotopic, i.e., homotopic to a constant map. Since $u_d$ is assumed smooth, it is continuous, and thus there exists a homotopy between $u_d$ and a constant map $c: B^3 \\to S^2$, where $c(x) = p$ for some fixed point $p \\in S^2$.\n\nThis homotopy, defined on the bulk $B^3$, can be restricted to the boundary $\\partial B^3 = S^2$. On the boundary, the map $u_d$ is prescribed to be $g_d$, i.e., $u_d|_{S^2} = g_d$. The constant map $c$ restricted to the boundary, $c|_{S^2}$, is also a constant map. Therefore, the existence of a homotopy on $B^3$ implies that the boundary map $g_d: S^2 \\to S^2$ is homotopic to a constant map.\n\nTopological degree is an invariant under homotopy. This means that if two maps are homotopic, they must have the same degree. The degree of any constant map from $S^2$ to $S^2$ is $0$. Therefore, if $g_d$ were homotopic to a constant map, we would have $\\deg(g_d) = 0$.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the boundary map $g_d$ has topological degree $d$, and we are given that $d \\ge 2$. This leads to the contradiction $d = 0$, which is false.\n\nThe initial assumption that $u_d$ is smooth everywhere in $B^3$ must be incorrect. Consequently, $u_d$ must have at least one singularity in the interior of $B^3$.

We consider the family of rescaled maps $u_r(y) := u_d(x_0 + ry)$ for $y \\in B_1(0)$ as the scaling factor $r$ approaches $0$. A subsequence of these maps converges to a \"tangent map\" $u_0: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$.\n\nThis tangent map $u_0$ is itself a non-constant, energy-minimizing harmonic map, and it is homogeneous of degree $0$. This homogeneity implies that $u_0(y)$ depends only on the direction of $y$, i.e., $u_0(y) = \\phi(y/|y|)$ for some map $\\phi: S^2 \\to S^2$. The condition that $u_0$ is a harmonic map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$ implies that its \"profile\" map $\\phi$ is a harmonic map from $S^2$ to $S^2$.\n\nThe normalized energy density can be related to the energy of the tangent map. By performing a change of variables $x = x_0 + ry$ in the integral, with $dx = r^3 dy$ and $\\nabla_x = r^{-1} \\nabla_y$, we get:\n$$\nr^{-1} \\int_{B_{r}(x_{0})} \\frac{1}{2} |\\nabla_x u_{d}(x)|^{2} \\, dx = r^{-1} \\int_{B_{1}(0)} \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\frac{1}{r}\\nabla_y u_{d}(x_0+ry)\\right|^{2} r^3 \\, dy = \\int_{B_{1}(0)} \\frac{1}{2} |\\nabla_y u_r(y)|^{2} \\, dy = E(u_r; B_1(0))\n$$\nTaking the limit as $r \\to 0^+$, and using the energy convergence of the blow-up sequence, we find:\n$$\n\\Theta(u_{d},x_{0}) = \\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} E(u_r; B_1(0)) = E(u_0; B_1(0))\n$$\nNow we compute the energy of the tangent map $u_0(y) = \\phi(y/|y|)$ in the unit ball $B_1(0)$.

Since $u_d$ is a minimizer, all its singularities must have indices of the same sign, which must match the sign of the total degree.
