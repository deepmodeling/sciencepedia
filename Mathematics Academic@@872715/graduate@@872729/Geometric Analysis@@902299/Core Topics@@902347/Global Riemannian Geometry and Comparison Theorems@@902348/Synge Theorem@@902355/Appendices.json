We are asked to compute the index form $I(V,V)$ for a specific vector field $V$ along a closed geodesic $\\gamma$ on the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ and to interpret the result in the context of Synge's theorem.\n\nThe index form is given by the formula:\n$$\nI(V,V) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\Big( \\langle D_{t} V, D_{t} V \\rangle - \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\Big) \\, dt\n$$\nWe are given several conditions on the vector field $V$ and the geodesic $\\gamma$.\n1. $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which implies $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)| = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n2. $V$ is a parallel vector field along $\\gamma$, meaning its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is zero: $D_{t} V = 0$.\n3. $V$ has unit length: $|V(t)| = 1$ for all $t$.\n4. $V$ is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector: $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nLet us first simplify the integrand using the given information. The first term in the integrand is $\\langle D_{t} V, D_{t} V \\rangle$. Since we are given that $D_{t} V = 0$, this term is identically zero:\n$$\n\\langle D_{t} V, D_{t} V \\rangle = \\langle 0, 0 \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThus, the index form simplifies to:\n$$\nI(V,V) = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the term involving the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. The manifold is the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ with its standard round metric, which is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor is given by the formula:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = K \\left( \\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, $K=1$, and we substitute $X=V$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma} = 1 \\cdot \\left( \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle V - \\langle V, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nWe can now use the properties of $\\gamma$ and $V$. Since $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = |\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Since $V$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, we have $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$. Substituting these into the expression for the curvature tensor gives:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma} = (1)V - (0)\\dot{\\gamma} = V\n$$\nNow we substitute this result back into the integrand for the index form:\n$$\n\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\langle V, V \\rangle\n$$\nSince $V$ is a unit vector field, we have $\\langle V(t), V(t) \\rangle = |V(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$. The integrand is therefore constant and equal to $1$.\n\nWe can now compute the integral:\n$$\nI(V,V) = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} 1 \\, dt = - [t]_{0}^{2\\pi} = -(2\\pi - 0) = -2\\pi\n$$\nThe value of the index form is $-2\\pi$.\n\nThe sign of this result is central to Synge's theorem and its related arguments. Synge's theorem states that a compact, orientable, even-dimensional Riemannian manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature must be simply connected. A related result is that a compact, odd-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature must be orientable.\n\nThe core of the proof relies on the second variation of the energy functional, which is given by the index form. A geodesic is a critical point of the energy functional. If the second variation (the index form) can be made negative for some variation field, the geodesic is not a local minimum of energy (and therefore not a minimum of length). Such a geodesic is called unstable.\n\nOur calculation, $I(V,V) = -2\\pi  0$, explicitly demonstrates that the great circle geodesic $\\gamma$ is unstable. The existence of even one such vector field $V$ for which the index form is negative implies that the index of the geodesic is at least $1$.\n\nThe argument for Synge's theorem for simple connectivity proceeds by contradiction. Assume $M$ is a compact, orientable, even-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature, but is *not* simply connected. Then there exists a non-trivial homotopy class of loops. In this class, there must be a loop of minimum length, which is a closed geodesic $\\gamma$. Because $M$ is orientable, one can construct a non-trivial periodic parallel vector field $V$ along $\\gamma$ that is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ (as in this problem). The second variation formula for such a field in a positively curved space yields a negative value, as we have explicitly calculated for $S^n$. This implies that $\\gamma$ is not a true local minimum of length, contradicting the assumption that it was the shortest loop in its homotopy class. Therefore, no such non-trivial loop can exist, and the manifold must be simply connected ($\\pi_1(M) = \\{e\\}$).\n\nOur specific result $I(V,V) = -2\\pi$ provides a concrete calculation underpinning this fundamental argument in Riemannian geometry, showing how positive curvature forces global topological properties.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2\\pi}\n$$", "id": "2992056"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of vector fields under parallel transport along a closed loop, known as holonomy, provides another key to unlocking the topological implications of curvature.

This action is free and properly discontinuous. The quotient space $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold. Since $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is the image of the compact set $[0,1]^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ under the quotient map $p \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$, the manifold $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is compact. The metric $g_0$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is defined such that the projection $p$ is a local isometry from $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$ to $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$.\n\n2.  **Curvature:** Sectional curvature is a local geometric invariant. Since $p$ is a local isometry, the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$ at any point must be equal to the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$ at the corresponding points. The standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\text{eucl}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is flat; its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its sectional curvature is identically zero, $K_{\\text{eucl}} \\equiv 0$. Therefore, the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$ is also identically zero, $K \\equiv 0$. This means the sectional curvature is non-negative ($K \\ge 0$) but not strictly positive ($K  0$).\n\n3.  **Fundamental Group:** The space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the universal covering space of $\\mathbb{T}^n$, as $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is simply connected. The fundamental group of the base space, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^n)$, is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations of the covering. The deck transformations are precisely the integer translations by vectors in $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Thus, the fundamental group of the $n$-torus is $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$. For any $n \\ge 1$, this group is non-trivial. In particular, $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is not simply connected.\n\n4.  **Orientability:** An orientation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by a choice of a continuous, non-vanishing $n$-form, e.g., $dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$. A diffeomorphism $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is orientation-preserving if the determinant of its Jacobian matrix is positive. The deck transformations are translations $T_v(x) = x+v$ for $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The Jacobian of $T_v$ is the identity matrix, whose determinant is $1$. Therefore, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is by orientation-preserving isometries. Because the group of deck transformations preserves orientation, the orientation of the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ descends to a well-defined orientation on the quotient manifold $\\mathbb{T}^n$. Hence, $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is orientable for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The construction via the quotient $\\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$ with $g_0$ making $p$ a local isometry gives a compact Riemannian manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$ that is locally isometric to $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$, hence has sectional curvature $K \\equiv 0$.**\nAs established in points $1$ and $2$ of our analysis, $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is compact. By definition of $g_0$, it is locally isometric to $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$. Since sectional curvature is a local property, the zero curvature of Euclidean space implies that the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$ is identically zero, $K \\equiv 0$. The statement is a correct description of the flat torus.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Synge’s theorem states that any compact even-dimensional orientable manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature is simply connected; therefore $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}, g_0)$ must be simply connected.**\nThis statement makes a crucial error in its premise. The version of Synge's theorem provided in the problem (and its standard formulation) requires *strictly positive* sectional curvature ($K  0$), not merely non-negative ($K \\ge 0$). The manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}, g_0)$ has $K \\equiv 0$, so it does not satisfy the strict inequality. Furthermore, the conclusion that $\\mathbb{T}^{2m}$ must be simply connected is false; as we showed in point $3$, its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2m}$, which is non-trivial for $m \\ge 1$. The flat torus is the classic counterexample demonstrating that the strict positivity condition in Synge's theorem cannot be weakened to non-negativity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The fundamental group of $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, so in even dimension the simply-connectedness conclusion of Synge’s theorem cannot be deduced without the strict positivity of sectional curvature.**\nAs shown in point $3$, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$. For any even dimension $n=2m \\ge 2$, the manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}, g_0)$ is compact, orientable, and has non-negative sectional curvature ($K \\equiv 0$). However, it is not simply connected. This demonstrates that if the hypothesis of Synge's theorem is weakened from $K  0$ to $K \\ge 0$, the conclusion of simple-connectedness no longer holds. Therefore, the strict positivity of sectional curvature is an essential hypothesis. The statement accurately captures this fact.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In odd dimension, Synge’s theorem predicts non-orientability under positive sectional curvature; thus $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m+1}, g_0)$ provides a counterexample.**\nThis statement misrepresents the theorem. The problem states that for a compact, odd-dimensional manifold, positive sectional curvature implies *orientability*. This statement claims the opposite, that it predicts *non-orientability*. This is fundamentally wrong. Secondly, $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m+1}, g_0)$ has $K \\equiv 0$ and thus does not satisfy the hypothesis of positive sectional curvature. A manifold cannot be a counterexample to a theorem whose hypotheses it does not meet.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.

As detailed in point $4$ of our analysis, the deck transformations for the covering $p \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$ are the integer translations. Translations are rigid motions whose differentials are the identity map, which has determinant $1$. Since the deck transformations are orientation-preserving, the orientation of the simply connected cover $\\mathbb{R}^n$ projects to a consistent orientation on the quotient $\\mathbb{T}^n$.
