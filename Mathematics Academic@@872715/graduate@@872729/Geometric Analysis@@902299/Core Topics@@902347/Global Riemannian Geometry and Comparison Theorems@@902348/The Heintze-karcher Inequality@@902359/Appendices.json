We must derive the constants $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{sum}}$ for $H_* = H$ and $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{avg}}$ for $H_* = H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ using a prescribed set of tools.\n\nLet us begin by relating the volume of $\\Omega$ to an integral over its boundary $M$. The coarea formula provides the necessary framework. We consider the inward normal flow $F(p,t) = p - t\\nu(p)$ for $p \\in M$ and $t \\ge 0$. The Jacobian of this map, restricted to the tangent space of $M$, is given by $J(p,t) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (1 - t\\kappa_i(p))$. This represents the infinitesimal area scaling factor of a surface element on $M$ as it is transported to a parallel surface inside $\\Omega$.\n\nThe volume of the domain $\\Omega$ can be expressed by integrating the areas of these parallel surfaces. For each point $p \\in M$, let $d(p)$ be the distance from $p$ along the inward normal to the cut locus of $M$. The segment $\\{p - t\\nu(p) : t \\in [0, d(p))\\}$ lies entirely inside $\\Omega$. The volume of $\\Omega$ is precisely the volume swept by these normal segments:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega) = \\int_{M} \\left( \\int_{0}^{d(p)} J(p,t) \\, dt \\right) d\\mu(p)\n$$\nwhere $d\\mu$ is the volume element on $M$. Note that this formulation correctly accounts for the volume, as it integrates the Jacobian determinant of the map from $(p,t)$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ over the set $U = \\{(p,t) \\in M \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ | t  d(p)\\}$.\n\nOur next step is to find an upper bound for the Jacobian $J(p,t)$. We are given that $J(p,t) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (1 - t\\kappa_i(p))$. The domain is convex, which means $\\kappa_i(p) \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ and $p \\in M$. For the Jacobian to be well-defined and non-negative, we must have $1-t\\kappa_i(p) \\ge 0$ for all $i$, which holds for $t \\le 1/\\max_i(\\kappa_i(p))$. Let us apply the arithmetic-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality to the $n-1$ non-negative numbers $\\{1 - t\\kappa_i(p)\\}_{i=1}^{n-1}$.\n\nThe geometric mean of these numbers is $\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (1 - t\\kappa_i(p))\\right)^{1/(n-1)} = (J(p,t))^{1/(n-1)}$.\nThe arithmetic mean is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (1 - t\\kappa_i(p)) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left( (n-1) - t\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\kappa_i(p) \\right) = 1 - t \\left( \\frac{1}{n-1}H(p) \\right) = 1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)\n$$\nThe AM-GM inequality states that the geometric mean is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. Thus,\n$$\n(J(p,t))^{1/(n-1)} \\le 1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)\n$$\nRaising both sides to the power of $n-1$, we get an upper bound for the Jacobian:\n$$\nJ(p,t) \\le (1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n-1}\n$$\nThis inequality is valid for $t$ such that all terms $1-t\\kappa_i(p)$ are non-negative. This condition implies $1-tH_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p) \\ge 0$, since $H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is the average of the $\\kappa_i$.\n\nNow, we substitute this bound into the volume integral. The distance to the cut locus $d(p)$ is bounded by the distance to the first focal point, $t_{\\text{focal}}(p) = 1/\\max_i(\\kappa_i(p))$. Since $H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_i \\kappa_i(p) \\le \\max_i \\kappa_i(p)$, it follows that $1/H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p) \\ge 1/\\max_i \\kappa_i(p) = t_{\\text{focal}}(p)$. Therefore, $d(p) \\le t_{\\text{focal}}(p) \\le 1/H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)$. This ensures that for $t \\in [0, d(p)]$, the term $1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)$ is non-negative, and the inequality for $J(p,t)$ holds.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega) = \\int_{M} \\left( \\int_{0}^{d(p)} J(p,t) \\, dt \\right) d\\mu(p) \\le \\int_{M} \\left( \\int_{0}^{d(p)} (1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n-1} \\, dt \\right) d\\mu(p)\n$$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{d(p)} (1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n-1} \\, dt = \\left[ -\\frac{(1 - t H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n}}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\right]_{0}^{d(p)} = \\frac{1 - (1 - d(p)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n}}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)}\n$$\nSince $d(p) H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p) \\le 1$, the term $(1 - d(p)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))$ is non-negative. Therefore, $(1 - d(p)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n} \\ge 0$. This leads to the bound:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - (1 - d(p)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n}}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\le \\frac{1}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the inequality for the volume, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega) \\le \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\, d\\mu(p) = \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\, d\\mu(p)\n$$\nRearranging this inequality gives the result for the averaged mean curvature $H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\, d\\mu(p) \\ge n \\, \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the constant for the averaged mean curvature convention as $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{avg}} = n$.\n\nNext, we derive the constant for the sum-of-principal-curvatures mean curvature, $H(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\kappa_i(p)$. By definition, $H(p) = (n-1)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)$. We can substitute this into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H(p)} \\, d\\mu(p) = \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{(n-1)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\, d\\mu(p) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\, d\\mu(p)\n$$\nUsing the inequality we just derived for $H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n-1} \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\, d\\mu(p) \\ge \\frac{1}{n-1} (n \\, \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)) = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)\n$$\nThus, we have the inequality for the sum convention:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H(p)} \\, d\\mu(p) \\ge \\frac{n}{n-1} \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)\n$$\nThis gives the constant for the sum-of-curvatures convention as $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{sum}} = \\frac{n}{n-1}$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that these constants are sharp. Sharpness is established by identifying a case where the inequality becomes an equality. Let us examine the conditions for equality in our derivation.\n1. The AM-GM inequality becomes an equality if and only if all terms are equal: $1-t\\kappa_1(p) = \\dots = 1-t\\kappa_{n-1}(p)$, which implies $\\kappa_1(p) = \\dots = \\kappa_{n-1}(p)$. This means the boundary $M$ must be umbilical at every point. For a closed boundary, this implies $M$ is a sphere.\n2. The inequality $\\frac{1 - (1 - d(p)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n}}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)} \\le \\frac{1}{n H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)}$ becomes an equality if $(1 - d(p)H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p))^{n} = 0$, which implies $d(p) = 1/H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)$.\n\nConsider a ball $\\Omega = B_R$ of radius $R$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Its boundary $M = \\partial B_R$ is a sphere of radius $R$.\n- The inward normal points to the center. The principal curvatures are constant and equal: $\\kappa_i = 1/R$ for all $i$. This satisfies the first condition for equality.\n- The mean curvatures are $H_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{R} = 1/R$ and $H = (n-1)/R$.\n- The cut locus for any point on the sphere is the center of the ball, so the distance to the cut locus is $d(p) = R$ for all $p \\in M$.\n- Let's check the second condition: $d(p) = 1/H_{\\mathrm{avg}}(p)$ becomes $R = 1/(1/R) = R$, which is true.\nSince both conditions for equality hold for a ball, we can expect the constant to be sharp. Let's verify by direct computation.\nLet $\\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega) = V_n R^n$ and $\\mathrm{Area}(M) = nV_n R^{n-1}$, where $V_n$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nFor $H_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{avg}}} \\, d\\mu = \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{1/R} \\, d\\mu = R \\int_{M} d\\mu = R \\cdot \\mathrm{Area}(M) = R \\cdot (nV_n R^{n-1}) = nV_n R^n = n \\, \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H_{\\mathrm{avg}}} d\\mu = n \\, \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)$ for a ball, so $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{avg}} = n$ is sharp.\n\nFor $H$:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H} \\, d\\mu = \\int_{M} \\frac{1}{(n-1)/R} \\, d\\mu = \\frac{R}{n-1} \\int_{M} d\\mu = \\frac{R}{n-1} \\mathrm{Area}(M) = \\frac{R}{n-1} (nV_n R^{n-1}) = \\frac{n}{n-1} V_n R^n = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\int_{M} \\frac{1}{H} d\\mu = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Omega)$ for a ball, so $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{sum}} = \\frac{n}{n-1}$ is sharp.\n\nThe pair of sharp constants is $(C_{n}^{\\mathrm{sum}}, C_{n}^{\\mathrm{avg}}) = (\\frac{n}{n-1}, n)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{n}{n-1}  n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3035616"}, {"introduction": "While the sphere represents the equality case of the Heintze-Karcher inequality, true understanding comes from exploring shapes where the inequality is strict.
