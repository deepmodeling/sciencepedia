The problem provides the metric $g$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ in Cartesian coordinates $x^\\mu = (x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, x, y, z)$ as the line element $ds^2 = -\\mathrm{d}t^{2}+\\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\\mathrm{d}y^{2}+\\mathrm{d}z^{2}$. The components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are the coefficients of the terms $\\mathrm{d}x^\\mu \\mathrm{d}x^\\nu$. Thus, we can write the metric tensor as a matrix:\n$$\ng_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThese components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are constant throughout the spacetime manifold in these coordinates.\n\nThe Einstein field equations are $G_{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi G\\,T_{\\mu\\nu}$, where $G_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor. A vacuum solution is defined by the condition $T_{\\mu\\nu}=0$, which implies $G_{\\mu\\nu}=0$. We must demonstrate that the given metric leads to $G_{\\mu\\nu}=0$.\n\nThe Einstein tensor is defined as $G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu\\nu}$, where $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor and $R$ is the Ricci scalar (the trace of the Ricci tensor). To find these, we must first compute the Riemann curvature tensor, $R^\\rho{}_{\\sigma\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nThe Riemann tensor is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection components, the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$. The Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by two conditions: it is torsion-free and metric-compatible. These conditions lead to the following formula for the Christoffel symbols in terms of the metric tensor:\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ are the components of the inverse metric. In our case, the metric components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are constant for all $\\mu,\\nu$. Therefore, all partial derivatives of the metric components with respect to the coordinates $x^\\sigma$ are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial x^\\gamma} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\n$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that all components of the connection are zero:\n$$\n\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0\n$$\nThis result signifies that the coordinate basis vectors $(\\partial_t, \\partial_x, \\partial_y, \\partial_z)$ are parallel-transported along themselves, which is a key feature of a flat spacetime with Cartesian coordinates.\n\nNext, we calculate the Riemann curvature tensor using its definition in terms of the Christoffel symbols:\n$$\nR^\\rho{}_{\\sigma\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\lambda\\mu} \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\sigma\\nu} - \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\lambda\\nu} \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\sigma\\mu}\n$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ are identically zero, their derivatives are also zero. The terms quadratic in the Christoffel symbols are likewise zero. Consequently, all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero:\n$$\nR^\\rho{}_{\\sigma\\mu\\nu} = 0\n$$\nThe vanishing of the Riemann curvature tensor is the defining characteristic of a flat (i.e., non-curved) spacetime.\n\nFrom the Riemann tensor, we compute the Ricci tensor, $R_{\\mu\\nu}$, by contracting the first and third indices:\n$$\nR_{\\mu\\nu} = R^\\rho{}_{\\mu\\rho\\nu}\n$$\nSince all components of the Riemann tensor are zero, all components of the Ricci tensor must also be zero:\n$$\nR_{\\mu\\nu} = 0\n$$\nThe Ricci scalar, $R$, is the trace of the Ricci tensor, computed as $R = g^{\\mu\\nu}R_{\\mu\\nu}$. With $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$, the Ricci scalar is also zero:\n$$\nR = 0\n$$\nNow we can compute the Einstein tensor, $G_{\\mu\\nu}$:\n$$\nG_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(0)g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0\n$$\nSince we have shown that $G_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ for the Minkowski metric, the Einstein field equations $G_{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi G\\,T_{\\mu\\nu}$ become $0 = 8\\pi G\\,T_{\\mu\\nu}$. Assuming the gravitational constant $G$ is non-zero, this implies that the stress-energy tensor must be zero, $T_{\\mu\\nu}=0$. This confirms that the flat Minkowski spacetime is a vacuum solution of General Relativity.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to classify the causal character of the tangent vector field $v=\\partial_{t}+\\partial_{x}$. This is done by evaluating its squared norm, $g(v,v)$. The vector $v$ has components $v^\\mu$ in the coordinate basis $(\\partial_t, \\partial_x, \\partial_y, \\partial_z)$, which we can write as $(\\partial_0, \\partial_1, \\partial_2, \\partial_3)$. Decomposing $v$ in this basis gives $v = 1 \\cdot \\partial_t + 1 \\cdot \\partial_x + 0 \\cdot \\partial_y + 0 \\cdot \\partial_z$. Thus, the contravariant components of the vector are $v^\\mu = (1, 1, 0, 0)$.\n\nThe squared norm is computed by contracting the vector with itself using the metric:\n$$\ng(v,v) = g_{\\mu\\nu} v^{\\mu} v^{\\nu} = \\sum_{\\mu=0}^{3} \\sum_{\\nu=0}^{3} g_{\\mu\\nu} v^{\\mu} v^{\\nu}\n$$\nUsing the diagonal form of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and the components of $v^\\mu$:\n$$\ng(v,v) = g_{00}v^{0}v^{0} + g_{11}v^{1}v^{1} + g_{22}v^{2}v^{2} + g_{33}v^{3}v^{3}\n$$\nSubstituting the values $g_{00}=-1$, $g_{11}=1$, $g_{22}=1$, $g_{33}=1$ and $v^0=1$, $v^1=1$, $v^2=0$, $v^3=0$:\n$$\ng(v,v) = (-1)(1)^2 + (1)(1)^2 + (1)(0)^2 + (1)(0)^2 = -1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe causal character of a vector $v$ is determined by the sign of its squared norm:\n- If $g(v,v)  0$, the vector is timelike.\n- If $g(v,v)  0$, the vector is spacelike.\n- If $g(v,v) = 0$, the vector is null or lightlike.\n\nSince $g(v,v)=0$, the vector $v=\\partial_{t}+\\partial_{x}$ is a null vector. This corresponds to the world-line of a particle moving at the speed of light in the positive $x$-direction. The final answer required is the numerical value of $g(v,v)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2995498"}, {"introduction": "A critical test for any new physical theory is its ability to reproduce the results of the successful theory it supersedes in the appropriate limit.

The Riemann tensor components in the orthonormal frame are defined by $\\Omega^{\\hat{a}}{}_{\\hat{b}} = \\frac{1}{2} R^{\\hat{a}}{}_{\\hat{b}\\hat{c}\\hat{d}} \\omega^{\\hat{c}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{d}}$.\n\nWe compute the curvature two-forms:\n- $\\Omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} = d\\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} + \\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{c}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{c}}{}_{\\hat{1}}$. The sum over $\\hat{c}$ only has non-zero terms for $\\hat{c} \\in \\{\\hat{0}, \\hat{1}\\}$, but $\\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{0}}=0$ and $\\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{1}}=0$. In fact, only terms with $\\hat{c} \\neq \\hat{0}, \\hat{1}$ contribute, which are zero. So $\\Omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} = d\\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} = d(f'(r)\\omega^{\\hat{0}}) = df'(r) \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{0}} + f'(r)d\\omega^{\\hat{0}}$.\n  $df'(r) = f''(r)dr = f''(r)f(r)\\omega^{\\hat{1}}$.\n  $d\\omega^{\\hat{0}} = -f'(r) \\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}$.\n  $\\Omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} = f''(r)f(r) \\omega^{\\hat{1}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{0}} + f'(r)(-f'(r) \\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}) = -(f''(r)f(r) + (f'(r))^2) \\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}$.\n  The derivatives of $f(r) = (1-2M/r)^{1/2}$ are $f'(r) = \\frac{M}{r^2}f(r)^{-1}$ and $f''(r) = -\\frac{2M}{r^3}f(r)^{-1} - \\frac{M^2}{r^4}f(r)^{-3}$.\n  The coefficient is $-(f''f + (f')^2) = -((-\\frac{2M}{r^3} - \\frac{M^2}{r^4f^2}) + \\frac{M^2}{r^4f^2}) = \\frac{2M}{r^3}$.\n  So, $\\Omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} = \\frac{2M}{r^3} \\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}$. This implies $R^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}\\hat{0}\\hat{1}} = \\frac{2M}{r^3}$.\n\n- $\\Omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}} = d\\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}} + \\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}} = 0 + (f'\\omega^{\\hat{0}}) \\wedge (-\\frac{f}{r}\\omega^{\\hat{2}}) = -\\frac{f'f}{r}\\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{2}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}\\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{2}}$.\n  This implies $R^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{0}\\hat{2}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n\n- $\\Omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{3}} = d\\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{3}} + \\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{3}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}\\omega^{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{3}}$.\n  This implies $R^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{3}\\hat{0}\\hat{3}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n\n- $\\Omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}} = d\\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}} + \\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{0}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}} + \\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{3}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{3}}{}_{\\hat{2}}$. The term with $\\omega^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}}$ is zero. The sum gives just $d\\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}}$. A detailed calculation shows $\\Omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}\\omega^{\\hat{1}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{2}}$.\n  This implies $R^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{1}\\hat{2}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n\n- $\\Omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{3}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}\\omega^{\\hat{1}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{3}}$.\n  This implies $R^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{3}\\hat{1}\\hat{3}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n\n- $\\Omega^{\\hat{2}}{}_{\\hat{3}} = d\\omega^{\\hat{2}}{}_{\\hat{3}} + \\omega^{\\hat{2}}{}_{\\hat{1}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{3}} = \\frac{1-f(r)^2}{r^2} \\omega^{\\hat{2}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{3}} = \\frac{2M/r}{r^2} \\omega^{\\hat{2}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{3}} = \\frac{2M}{r^3}\\omega^{\\hat{2}} \\wedge \\omega^{\\hat{3}}$.\n  This implies $R^{\\hat{2}}{}_{\\hat{3}\\hat{2}\\hat{3}} = \\frac{2M}{r^3}$.\n\nThe problem specifies to use the vacuum condition $R_{\\mu\\nu}=0$. The non-zero Ricci tensor components in the orthonormal frame must be zero. For instance, $R_{\\hat{2}\\hat{2}}=R^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{0}\\hat{2}}+R^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{1}\\hat{2}}+R^{\\hat{3}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{3}\\hat{2}}$. The fully covariant components are more convenient.\n$R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{1}\\hat{0}\\hat{1}} = \\eta_{\\hat{0}\\hat{0}} R^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{1}\\hat{0}\\hat{1}} = - \\frac{2M}{r^3}$.\n$R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{2}\\hat{0}\\hat{2}} = \\eta_{\\hat{0}\\hat{0}} R^{\\hat{0}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{0}\\hat{2}} = - (-\\frac{M}{r^3}) = \\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n$R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{3}\\hat{0}\\hat{3}} = \\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n$R_{\\hat{1}\\hat{2}\\hat{1}\\hat{2}} = \\eta_{\\hat{1}\\hat{1}} R^{\\hat{1}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{1}\\hat{2}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n$R_{\\hat{1}\\hat{3}\\hat{1}\\hat{3}} = -\\frac{M}{r^3}$.\n$R_{\\hat{2}\\hat{3}\\hat{2}\\hat{3}} = \\eta_{\\hat{2}\\hat{2}} R^{\\hat{2}}{}_{\\hat{3}\\hat{2}\\hat{3}} = \\frac{2M}{r^3}$.\nAll other components, not related to these by symmetry, are zero. The vacuum condition holds, e.g., $R_{\\hat{2}\\hat{2}}=R^{\\hat{c}}{}_{\\hat{2}\\hat{c}\\hat{2}} = \\eta^{00}R_{0202} + \\eta^{11}R_{1212} + \\eta^{33}R_{3232} = -(\\frac{M}{r^3}) + (-\\frac{M}{r^3}) + (\\frac{2M}{r^3}) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Kretschmann Scalar**\nThe Kretschmann scalar is $K = R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$. In an orthonormal frame, this simplifies to the sum of the squares of all individual components of the Riemann tensor in that frame, as $R^{\\hat{a}\\hat{b}\\hat{c}\\hat{d}} = \\eta^{\\hat{a}\\hat{e}}\\eta^{\\hat{b}\\hat{f}}\\eta^{\\hat{c}\\hat{g}}\\eta^{\\hat{d}\\hat{h}} R_{\\hat{e}\\hat{f}\\hat{g}\\hat{h}}$.\nWe sum over all non-zero components, taking into account symmetries. Due to the symmetries of the Riemann tensor ($R_{abcd}=-R_{bacd}=-R_{abdc}=R_{cdab}$), for each unique component type like $R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{1}\\hat{0}\\hat{1}}$, there are several terms in the full sum that contribute. It is equivalent to summing the squares of all independent components and multiplying by the appropriate factors.\nThe total sum is the sum of contributions from each of the six independent non-zero component types:\n$$\nK = 4 \\left( (R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{1}\\hat{0}\\hat{1}})^2 + (R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{2}\\hat{0}\\hat{2}})^2 + (R_{\\hat{0}\\hat{3}\\hat{0}\\hat{3}})^2 + (R_{\\hat{1}\\hat{2}\\hat{1}\\hat{2}})^2 + (R_{\\hat{1}\\hat{3}\\hat{1}\\hat{3}})^2 + (R_{\\hat{2}\\hat{3}\\hat{2}\\hat{3}})^2 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\nK = 4 \\left( \\left(-\\frac{2M}{r^3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{M}{r^3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{M}{r^3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{M}{r^3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{M}{r^3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2M}{r^3}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nK = 4 \\frac{M^2}{r^6} \\left( (-2)^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nK = 4 \\frac{M^2}{r^6} \\left( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 \\right) = 4 \\frac{M^2}{r^6} (12)\n$$\n$$\nK(r) = \\frac{48M^2}{r^6}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of Singularities**\nA true physical singularity corresponds to a divergence in a scalar invariant constructed from the curvature, while a coordinate singularity is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system where a scalar invariant remains finite.\n\n- At $r=2M$ (the Schwarzschild radius), the metric components $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ are singular in Schwarzschild coordinates. However, the Kretschmann scalar is:\n  $$\n  K(r=2M) = \\frac{48M^2}{(2M)^6} = \\frac{48M^2}{64M^6} = \\frac{3}{4M^4}\n  $$\n  Since $K$ is finite at $r=2M$, this is not a true curvature singularity. It is a coordinate singularity, and the surface $r=2M$ is an event horizon.\n\n- At $r=0$:\n  $$\n  \\lim_{r\\to 0} K(r) = \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{48M^2}{r^6} = \\infty\n  $$\n  The Kretschmann scalar diverges as $r \\to 0$. This indicates that the spacetime curvature becomes infinite. Therefore, $r=0$ is a true, physical curvature singularity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{48M^2}{r^6}}\n$$", "id": "2995545"}]}
