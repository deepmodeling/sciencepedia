The Margulis lemma (in its nonpositive curvature form) guarantees the existence of a positive constant (a “Margulis constant”) for a given metric that controls the small-displacement part of the fundamental group: for any point $x \\in M$, the subgroup generated by deck transformations whose displacement at $x$ is below that constant is virtually nilpotent, and this gives rise to the thick-thin decomposition threshold.

This constant defines the threshold for the \"thin part\" of the manifold with respect to the metric $\\bar{g}$. A point $x \\in M$ is in the thin part if there exists a non-trivial deck transformation $\\gamma \\in \\pi_{1}(M)$ such that its displacement at $x$ is less than $\\mu_{\\bar{g}}$.

The value $\\mu_{\\bar{g}}$ is the displacement threshold defining the thin region for the manifold $(M, \\bar{g})$.\n\nOur goal is to find the corresponding threshold, $\\varepsilon_{g}$, for the original manifold $(M,g)$. This means we must find the value $\\varepsilon_{g}$ such that the condition $d_{g}(x, \\gamma x) < \\varepsilon_{g}$ is equivalent to the condition $d_{\\bar{g}}(x, \\gamma x) < \\mu_{\\bar{g}}$.\n\nTo relate the two conditions, we use the given scaling law for distances (Fact 1): for any positive constant $c > 0$, the distance functions for the metrics $g$ and $cg$ are related by:\n$$d_{c g}(p,q) = \\sqrt{c} \\, d_{g}(p,q)$$\nIn our case, the scaling constant is $c = \\frac{1}{b^2}$.

Thus, for the displacement of a deck transformation $\\gamma$ at point $x$, we have:\n$$d_{\\bar{g}}(x, \\gamma x) = \\frac{1}{b} d_{g}(x, \\gamma x)$$\nNow we can substitute this expression into the thin-part condition for the metric $\\bar{g}$:\n$$d_{\\bar{g}}(x, \\gamma x) < \\mu_{\\bar{g}} \\implies \\frac{1}{b} d_{g}(x, \\gamma x) < \\mu_{\\bar{g}}$$\nTo find the condition in terms of the displacement $d_{g}(x, \\gamma x)$, we multiply both sides of the inequality by $b$. Since $b > 0$, the inequality direction is preserved:\n$$d_{g}(x, \\gamma x) < b \\mu_{\\bar{g}}$$\nThis inequality, $d_{g}(x, \\gamma x) < b \\mu_{\\bar{g}}$, defines the thin-part condition with respect to the original metric $g$. The problem asks for the effective thin-part threshold $\\varepsilon_{g}$ for $(M,g)$. By comparing our derived inequality with the general form $d_{g}(x, \\gamma x) < \\varepsilon_{g}$, we can directly identify $\\varepsilon_{g}$.\nThus, the threshold for the metric $g$ is:\n$$\\varepsilon_{g} = b \\mu_{\\bar{g}}$$\nThis is the explicit closed-form analytic expression for the thin-part threshold for $(M,g)$ in terms of the given quantities $b$ and $\\mu_{\\bar{g}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{b \\mu_{\\bar{g}}}$$", "id": "3000746"}, {"introduction": "The Margulis lemma guarantees that thin parts of a hyperbolic $3$-manifold consist of tubes around short geodesics.
