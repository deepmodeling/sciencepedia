A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe action of an element $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ on a point $z \\in \\mathbb{H}^{2} \\cup S^{1}$ is given by the Möbius transformation $M(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. We will analyze the properties of the given elements $A$ and $B$.\n\nLet us define the diagonal matrices\n$$\nD_t = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(t)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad D_s = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(s)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-s) \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe elements $A$ and $B$ are given as $A = P D_t P^{-1}$ and $B = P D_s P^{-1}$.\n\n**Part 1: Properties of $A$ and $B$**\n\n1.  **Commutativity**: We are asked to establish that $A$ and $B$ commute. We compute the products $AB$ and $BA$:\n    $$\n    AB = (P D_t P^{-1})(P D_s P^{-1}) = P D_t (P^{-1}P) D_s P^{-1} = P D_t I D_s P^{-1} = P (D_t D_s) P^{-1}.\n    $$\n    $$\n    BA = (P D_s P^{-1})(P D_t P^{-1}) = P D_s (P^{-1}P) D_t P^{-1} = P D_s I D_t P^{-1} = P (D_s D_t) P^{-1}.\n    $$\n    Since $D_t$ and $D_s$ are diagonal matrices, they commute:\n    $$\n    D_t D_s = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(t)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(s)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(t+s)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-(t+s)) \\end{pmatrix} = D_s D_t.\n    $$\n    Therefore, $AB = P (D_t D_s) P^{-1} = P (D_s D_t) P^{-1} = BA$. The elements $A$ and $B$ commute.\n\n2.  **Hyperbolicity**: An element $M \\in \\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ is hyperbolic if its trace satisfies $|\\operatorname{tr}(M)|  2$. The trace is invariant under conjugation, i.e., $\\operatorname{tr}(PMP^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}(M)$.\n    For element $A$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(A) = \\operatorname{tr}(P D_t P^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}(D_t) = \\exp(t) + \\exp(-t) = 2\\cosh(t).\n    $$\n    Since $t  0$, we have $\\cosh(t)  1$, which implies $|\\operatorname{tr}(A)| = 2\\cosh(t)  2$. Thus, $A$ is a hyperbolic element.\n    Similarly, for element $B$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}(B) = \\operatorname{tr}(P D_s P^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}(D_s) = \\exp(s) + \\exp(-s) = 2\\cosh(s).\n    $$\n    Since $s  0$, we have $\\cosh(s)  1$, which implies $|\\operatorname{tr}(B)| = 2\\cosh(s)  2$. Thus, $B$ is also a hyperbolic element.\n\n3.  **Shared Fixed Points**: A point $x \\in S^{1}$ is a fixed point of an element $M$ if $M(x) = x$.\n    Let $x$ be a fixed point of $A$. Then $A(x) = x$, which is equivalent to $(P D_t P^{-1})(x) = x$. Applying $P^{-1}$ to both sides, we get $D_t(P^{-1}(x)) = P^{-1}(x)$. This means that $P^{-1}(x)$ is a fixed point of the transformation associated with $D_t$.\n    The transformation for $D_t$ is $z \\mapsto \\frac{\\exp(t)z + 0}{0z + \\exp(-t)} = \\exp(2t)z$. The fixed points are the solutions to $\\exp(2t)z = z$. Since $t  0$, $\\exp(2t) \\neq 1$, so the only finite solution is $z = 0$. The other fixed point is at infinity, as $\\lim_{z\\to\\infty} \\exp(2t)z = \\infty$.\n    Thus, the fixed points of the transformation $D_t$ are $\\{0, \\infty\\}$.\n    This implies that the set of values for $P^{-1}(x)$ must be $\\{0, \\infty\\}$. Consequently, the set of fixed points of $A$ is $\\{P(0), P(\\infty)\\}$.\n    The exact same argument holds for $B$, as its diagonalizable form $D_s$ also has fixed points $\\{0, \\infty\\}$. Therefore, the fixed points of $B$ are also $\\{P(0), P(\\infty)\\}$.\n    Conclusion: $A$ and $B$ have the same set of fixed points.\n\n4.  **Shared Axis**: For a hyperbolic element, its axis is the unique geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ connecting its two fixed points on the ideal boundary $S^{1}$. Since $A$ and $B$ are both hyperbolic and share the same two fixed points, they must share the same axis of translation.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Common Fixed Points**\n\nThe common fixed points are $x_{+} = P(\\infty)$ and $x_{-} = P(0)$, where $P$ is the Möbius transformation corresponding to the matrix $P = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe transformation is $P(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$.\n\nWe compute the image of $0$:\n$$\nx_{-} = P(0) = \\frac{a(0)+b}{c(0)+d} = \\frac{b}{d}.\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined because the problem states $d \\neq 0$.\n\nWe compute the image of $\\infty$:\n$$\nx_{+} = P(\\infty) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} P(z) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{az+b}{cz+d} = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{a + b/z}{c + d/z} = \\frac{a}{c}.\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined because the problem states $c \\neq 0$.\n\nSince $a, b, c, d$ are the entries of a matrix in $\\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, they are real numbers. Therefore, the fixed points $a/c$ and $b/d$ are real numbers and lie on the ideal boundary $\\mathbb{R} \\subset S^{1}$.\n\nThe unordered pair of common fixed points is $\\{\\frac{a}{c}, \\frac{b}{d}\\}$.\n\nTo distinguish them, we can analyze the dynamics. For $D_t(z) = \\exp(2t)z$ with $t0$, the origin $z=0$ is a repulsive fixed point, and $z=\\infty$ is an attractive fixed point. The conjugating map $P$ is a homeomorphism, so it preserves the nature of the fixed points. Therefore, $x_{-} = P(0) = b/d$ is the repulsive fixed point and $x_{+} = P(\\infty) = a/c$ is the attractive fixed point for both $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe problem asks for the unordered pair, which we express as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a}{c}  \\frac{b}{d} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2986378"}, {"introduction": "Having established the geometric consequence of commutativity, we now apply Preissman's theorem directly to a fundamental algebraic structure.

It is a standard problem in the intersection of Riemannian geometry and geometric group theory.\n\nThe problem asks for two things: an identification of the closed geodesic $\\gamma_{A}$ and an explanation for its primitivity, followed by a determination of the structure of the centralizer $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ and the computation of the index $\\big[C_{\\Gamma}(A) : \\langle A \\rangle \\big]$.\n\nFirst, we address the geodesic $\\gamma_{A}$. The manifold $M$ is the quotient space $M = \\mathbb{H}^{3}/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is the group of deck transformations, which is isomorphic to the fundamental group $\\pi_{1}(M)$. An element $A \\in \\Gamma$ is a loxodromic isometry of the universal cover $\\mathbb{H}^{3}$. A loxodromic isometry $A$ has exactly two fixed points on the boundary at infinity $\\partial\\mathbb{H}^{3}$, and it preserves the unique geodesic $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$ connecting these two points. The action of $A$ on $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$ is a translation by a certain distance, called the translation length of $A$. The projection of this invariant axis to the quotient manifold, $\\gamma_{A} = \\pi(\\mathrm{Ax}(A))$, is a closed geodesic. The length of $\\gamma_{A}$ is the translation length of $A$. A closed geodesic is defined as primitive if it is not a multiple wrapping of another, shorter, closed geodesic. In the context of the fundamental group, a closed geodesic corresponding to an element $g \\in \\Gamma$ is primitive if and only if the element $g$ is primitive. An element $g \\in \\Gamma$ is primitive if it cannot be written in the form $h^k$ for any $h \\in \\Gamma$ and any integer $k$ with $|k|1$. The problem statement explicitly assumes that the element $A \\in \\Gamma$ is primitive. Therefore, the associated closed geodesic $\\gamma_{A}$ is, by definition, a primitive closed geodesic in $M$.\n\nNext, we analyze the centralizer $C_{\\Gamma}(A) = \\{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma : \\gamma A = A \\gamma\\}$.\nFirst, we establish that $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is an abelian subgroup of $\\Gamma$. Let $\\gamma$ be any element in $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$. Since $\\gamma$ commutes with $A$, $\\gamma$ must map the set of fixed points of $A$ to itself. For a loxodromic isometry $A$, the fixed point set in $\\partial\\mathbb{H}^3$ consists of a source and a sink. As an element of $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbb{C})$, $\\gamma$ is an orientation-preserving isometry. An orientation-preserving isometry that maps the endpoints of a geodesic (the axis $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$) to themselves must either fix both endpoints or swap them. If $\\gamma$ were to swap the endpoints, it would be an elliptic rotation of order $2$ around a geodesic perpendicular to $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$. However, the group $\\Gamma$ is given as torsion-free, meaning it contains no elements of finite order other than the identity. Thus, any non-identity element $\\gamma \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ must fix the endpoints of $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$. This implies that $\\gamma$ must preserve the axis $\\mathrm{Ax}(A)$.\nAny two isometries of $\\mathbb{H}^{3}$ that preserve the same geodesic axis commute. This is a standard fact that can be seen by conjugating the axis to be, for instance, the vertical axis in the upper half-space model, where such isometries are compositions of dilations and rotations around that axis, actions which commute. Therefore, any two elements $\\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2} \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ commute with each other. This shows that $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is an abelian subgroup of $\\Gamma$.\n\nSince $A$ is a loxodromic isometry, it is of infinite order. Thus, $A$ is a non-trivial element of $\\Gamma$. The centralizer $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ contains $A$, so $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\nThe manifold $M$ is a closed orientable hyperbolic $3$-manifold. This implies that its sectional curvature is constant and equal to $-1$. Therefore, $M$ has strictly negative sectional curvature. We are instructed to use Preissman’s theorem, which states that for a compact manifold with strictly negative sectional curvature, any non-trivial abelian subgroup of its fundamental group is infinite cyclic.\nSince $M$ is a closed manifold, it is compact. Its fundamental group is $\\pi_{1}(M) \\cong \\Gamma$. We have established that $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is a non-trivial abelian subgroup of $\\Gamma$. By Preissman's theorem, $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ must be an infinite cyclic group, which is isomorphic to the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. The problem asks to determine the integer $r \\ge 0$ such that $C_{\\Gamma}(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{r}$. From our deduction, we have $r=1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the index $\\big[C_{\\Gamma}(A) : \\langle A \\rangle \\big]$.\nSince $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ is an infinite cyclic group, there exists a generator $B \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$ such that $C_{\\Gamma}(A) = \\langle B \\rangle$. Since $A \\in C_{\\Gamma}(A)$, $A$ must be a power of the generator $B$. So, we can write $A = B^k$ for some non-zero integer $k$.\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: $A$ is a primitive element in $\\Gamma$. By definition, this means $A$ cannot be expressed as a proper power of any other element in $\\Gamma$. That is, one cannot write $A = g^n$ for any $g \\in \\Gamma$ and integer $n$ with $|n|  1$.\nApplying this to our finding that $A = B^k$, the primitivity of $A$ forces $|k| \\le 1$. Since $A$ is not the identity, $k \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $|k|=1$, which implies $k=1$ or $k=-1$.\nIf $k=1$, then $A=B$. In this case, the subgroup generated by $A$ is $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle B \\rangle$, which is the entire centralizer group $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$.\nIf $k=-1$, then $A=B^{-1}$. The subgroup generated by $A$ is $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle B^{-1} \\rangle$. Since a cyclic group is generated by an element or its inverse, $\\langle B^{-1} \\rangle = \\langle B \\rangle = C_{\\Gamma}(A)$.\nIn both possible cases, we conclude that the subgroup $\\langle A \\rangle$ is equal to the group $C_{\\Gamma}(A)$.\nThe index of a subgroup in a group, $[G:H]$, is the number of distinct left (or right) cosets of $H$ in $G$. When the subgroup is the group itself, i.e., $H=G$, there is only one coset, which is $H$ itself. Thus, the index is $1$.\nFor our problem, the index is $\\big[C_{\\Gamma}(A) : \\langle A \\rangle \\big] = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2986415"}, {"introduction": "The power of Preissman's theorem in constraining abelian subgroups might suggest that all abelian structures related to the fundamental group are trivial.

There exist many examples of compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds (which have constant sectional curvature $K=-1$) with non-trivial first homology, i.e., with first Betti number $b_1 = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H_1(M, \\mathbb{Q}))  0$. Such manifolds can be constructed, for instance, via Dehn surgery on certain links in the $3$-sphere or as fiber bundles over the circle.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. If $M = \\Gamma \\backslash \\mathbb{H}^n$ is a compact quotient of hyperbolic $n$-space by a torsion-free uniform lattice $\\Gamma$, then $M$ has strictly negative sectional curvature and $H_1(M,\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{ab}}$; in particular, if there exists a surjective homomorphism $\\Gamma \\twoheadrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$, then $H_1(M,\\mathbb{Z})$ has a $\\mathbb{Z}$ summand.\n\nThis statement is correct.\n1.  Hyperbolic $n$-space $\\mathbb{H}^n$ has constant sectional curvature $K = -1$. A manifold $M$ constructed as the quotient of $\\mathbb{H}^n$ by a discrete, torsion-free, co-compact group of isometries $\\Gamma$ (a uniform lattice) is a compact Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature $K = -1$. It thus satisfies the hypotheses of Preissman's theorem.\n2.  The fundamental group of such a manifold is $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\Gamma$.\n3.  The first homology group is $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(M)^{\\mathrm{ab}} \\cong \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{ab}}$.\n4.  If there exists a surjective group homomorphism $\\phi: \\Gamma \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, this homomorphism must factor through the abelianization $\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{ab}}$, since the codomain $\\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian. This means there is a surjective homomorphism $\\bar{\\phi}: \\Gamma^{\\mathrm{ab}} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n5.  $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a finitely generated abelian group. The existence of a surjective homomorphism from it onto $\\mathbb{Z}$ implies that its free part is non-trivial; specifically, by the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, it must have at least one direct summand isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis statement correctly outlines a general mechanism responsible for the existence of non-trivial homology in this class of manifolds. Such manifolds are known to exist; for instance, any compact hyperbolic manifold that fibers over a circle has a fundamental group that surjects onto $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. The Riemannian product $S_{g_1} \\times S_{g_2}$ of two closed hyperbolic surfaces, equipped with the product metric, is strictly negatively curved and has nontrivial first homology, showing that Preissman’s theorem fails in dimension $4$.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The primary error is the claim that the product manifold $S_{g_1} \\times S_{g_2}$ with the product metric is \"strictly negatively curved\". Let the sectional curvature of $S_{g_1}$ and $S_{g_2}$ be $K_1 = -1$ and $K_2 = -1$ respectively. For a product manifold $M_1 \\times M_2$, the sectional curvature of a plane spanned by a tangent vector from $T M_1$ and a tangent vector from $T M_2$ is zero. Therefore, $S_{g_1} \\times S_{g_2}$ has sectional curvatures which are non-positive ($K \\le 0$) but not strictly negative. It contains planes of zero curvature. Consequently, this manifold does not satisfy the hypotheses of Preissman's theorem, and it cannot be used as an example to illustrate properties of manifolds that do. The statement that this \"shows that Preissman's theorem fails\" is also a misrepresentation. The theorem does not fail; its hypotheses are simply not met. It is true that $\\pi_1(S_{g_1} \\times S_{g_2}) \\cong \\pi_1(S_{g_1}) \\times \\pi_1(S_{g_2})$ contains non-cyclic abelian subgroups (e.g., $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$), which is precisely what Preissman's theorem would forbid if the curvature were strictly negative.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The flat torus $T^n$ has $H_1(T^n,\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$, which demonstrates that the abelianization of $\\pi_1$ can be large even under strictly negative curvature hypotheses.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The flat torus $T^n$ is a compact manifold whose standard metric has sectional curvature identically equal to zero ($K \\equiv 0$). It does not satisfy the \"strictly negative curvature\" hypothesis. Therefore, any observation about the torus, while true in its own context, does not provide a demonstration for what can happen \"under strictly negative curvature hypotheses\". It is a logically invalid argument to use an example that violates the premise to prove a conclusion about cases where the premise holds.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, statements A and C provide correct and distinct demonstrations of why compact, negatively curved manifolds can have non-trivial first homology. Statement A provides a concrete class of examples, while statement C describes the underlying group-theoretic mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2986407"}]}
