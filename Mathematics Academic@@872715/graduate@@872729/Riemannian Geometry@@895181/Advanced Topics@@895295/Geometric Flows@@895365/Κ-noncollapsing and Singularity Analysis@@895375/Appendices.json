The metric components are constant functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe Levi-Civita connection is defined by its Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$, which are computed from the metric tensor components as follows:\n$$ \\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{li}}{\\partial x^{j}} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial x^{i}} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{l}} \\right) $$\nwhere $g^{kl}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor. For the Euclidean metric, $g^{kl} = \\delta^{kl}$. Since all components $g_{ij}$ are constant, their partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate $x^j$ are zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^{k}} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j, k $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that they are all identically zero:\n$$ \\Gamma^{k}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 $$\n\nNext, we use the fundamental definition of the Riemann curvature tensor $R^{l}_{ijk}$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols:\n$$ R^{l}_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{l}_{ik}}{\\partial x^{j}} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{l}_{ij}}{\\partial x^{k}} + \\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\left( \\Gamma^{m}_{ik} \\Gamma^{l}_{mj} - \\Gamma^{m}_{ij} \\Gamma^{l}_{mk} \\right) $$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ are zero on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, their partial derivatives are also zero. Consequently, every term in the expression for $R^{l}_{ijk}$ is zero. This means all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero:\n$$ R^{l}_{ijk} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the Riemann curvature tensor field $\\mathrm{Rm}$ for $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ is the zero tensor.\n\nNow we analyze the premise of the $\\kappa$-noncollapsing condition: $|\\mathrm{Rm}| \\le r^{-2}$ on the geodesic ball $B_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}(x,r)$. Since $\\mathrm{Rm} = 0$, its pointwise norm $|\\mathrm{Rm}|$ is also $0$. For any scale $r > 0$, the quantity $r^{-2}$ is positive. The inequality $0 \\le r^{-2}$ is therefore always true.\n\nThis means that for $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$, the premise of the implication is always satisfied for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and any $r > 0$. For the manifold to be $\\kappa$-noncollapsed, the conclusion of the implication must therefore hold for all $x$ and $r$. The condition simplifies to:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}(B_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}(x,r)) \\ge \\kappa r^{n} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, r > 0 $$\n\nThe final step is to compute the volume of a geodesic ball in Euclidean space. A geodesic ball $B_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}(x,r)$ is the set of points $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that the Euclidean distance $d(x,y) \\le r$. This is the standard $n$-dimensional Euclidean ball of radius $r$. Its volume, derived from the Euclidean volume form $dx^{1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{n}$, is given by the well-known formula:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}(B_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}(x,r)) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2} + 1)} r^{n} $$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function. Let us denote the volume of the unit $n$-ball by $\\omega_{n} = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2} + 1)}$.\n\nSubstituting this volume into the inequality, we get:\n$$ \\omega_{n} r^{n} \\ge \\kappa r^{n} $$\nSince $r > 0$, we can divide both sides by $r^{n}$ without changing the inequality:\n$$ \\omega_{n} \\ge \\kappa $$\nThis inequality must hold for $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}})$ to be $\\kappa$-noncollapsed. The problem asks for the largest possible value of the constant $\\kappa$. From the inequality, the supremum for $\\kappa$ is precisely $\\omega_{n}$.\n\nTherefore, the largest constant $\\kappa$ is the volume of the unit $n$-ball in Euclidean space.\n$$ \\kappa = \\omega_{n} = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2} + 1)} $$\nThis expression is a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$, as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} } $$", "id": "3006910"}, {"introduction": "The geometric notion of non-collapsing is powerfully controlled by an analytic quantity: Perelman's $\\mathcal{W}$-entropy.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question in differential geometry. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nLet's begin by simplifying the expression for the $\\mathcal{W}$-entropy functional. Given that we are in Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\mathrm{Euc}})$, the scalar curvature is $R \\equiv 0$. The functional becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, f, \\tau) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left(\\tau |\\nabla f|^2 + f - n\\right) (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp(-f) \\, dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}}\n$$\nThe problem is to find the infimum of this functional, $\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau)$, over the set of all smooth functions $f$ satisfying the normalization condition. This is a problem in the calculus of variations. The minimizer of $\\mathcal{W}$, if it exists, must satisfy the associated Euler-Lagrange equation.\n\nA fundamental result from Perelman's work is that the critical points of the $\\mathcal{W}$-functional (for a fixed metric $g$ and scale $\\tau$) are functions $f$ that define a steady, shrinking, or expanding gradient Ricci soliton, depending on a parameter. Specifically, the Euler-Lagrange equation for a minimizer of $\\mathcal{W}(g, f, \\tau)$ is the gradient shrinking soliton equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(g) + \\nabla^2 f - \\frac{1}{2\\tau} g = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\mathrm{Ric}(g)$ is the Ricci tensor of the metric $g$, and $\\nabla^2 f$ is the Hessian of $f$.\n\nFor our case, the metric is the Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For this metric, the Ricci tensor is identically zero: $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}) = 0$. The equation for the minimizer $f$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 f = \\frac{1}{2\\tau} g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}\n$$\nIn standard Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, this equation reads:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} = \\frac{1}{2\\tau} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Integrating this equation twice with respect to the spatial variables yields the general solution for $f(x)$:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{4\\tau} |x - x_0|^2 + C\n$$\nfor some constant vector $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and a scalar constant $C$. The functional $\\mathcal{W}$ and the normalization condition are invariant under translations of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so we can set $x_0 = 0$ without loss of generality. The candidate minimizer is thus of the form $f(x) = \\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau} + C$.\n\nWe must now use the normalization condition to determine the constant $C$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau} + C\\right)\\right) \\, dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-C) \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\, dV_{g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}} = 1\n$$\nThe integrand is the probability density function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean $0$ and covariance matrix $2\\tau I_n$. Its integral over all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is exactly $1$. Therefore, the condition becomes $\\exp(-C) \\cdot 1 = 1$, which implies $C=0$.\n\nThus, the unique function (up to isometries) that minimizes the $\\mathcal{W}$-functional is:\n$$\nf_0(x) = \\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\n$$\nThe infimum $\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau)$ is the value of the functional evaluated at this minimizing function $f_0$.\n\nLet's compute $\\mathcal{W}(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, f_0, \\tau)$. First, we need the gradient of $f_0$:\n$$\n\\nabla f_0(x) = \\nabla \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\tau} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4\\tau} (2x_1, \\dots, 2x_n) = \\frac{x}{2\\tau}\n$$\nThe squared norm of the gradient is:\n$$\n|\\nabla f_0(x)|^2 = \\left|\\frac{x}{2\\tau}\\right|^2 = \\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau^2}\n$$\nNow we substitute $f_0$, $|\\nabla f_0|^2$, and $R=0$ into the expression for $\\mathcal{W}$:\n$$\n\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau) = \\mathcal{W}(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, f_0, \\tau) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left(\\tau \\left(\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau^2}\\right) + \\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau} - n\\right) (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\, dV\n$$\n$$\n\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left(\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau} + \\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau} - n\\right) (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\, dV\n$$\n$$\n\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\left(\\frac{|x|^2}{2\\tau} - n\\right) (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\, dV\n$$\nWe can split this into two integrals:\n$$\n\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau) = \\frac{1}{2\\tau} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |x|^2 (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\, dV - n \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} (4\\pi\\tau)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right) \\, dV\n$$\nThe second integral is the integral of a probability density function, which equals $1$. The first integral is the expectation of the squared norm of a random vector $X \\sim N(0, 2\\tau I_n)$. The expectation $\\mathbb{E}[|X|^2]$ is the sum of the variances of its components:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X|^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[X_i^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2\\tau = 2n\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting these values back:\n$$\n\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau) = \\frac{1}{2\\tau} (2n\\tau) - n(1) = n - n = 0\n$$\nThe fact that this is indeed the infimum is guaranteed by the sharp logarithmic Sobolev inequality, which is saturated precisely by the Gaussian density corresponding to our function $f_0$. This calculation confirms that the value obtained at the critical point is the global minimum.\n\n### Conclusion on Significance\nThe value $\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau) = 0$ is significant for several reasons in the context of singularity analysis. Perelman's entropy $\\mu(g, \\tau)$ is monotonic along the Ricci flow, serving as a measure of the geometric \"complexity\" or \"disorder\" of a space.\n- A value of $0$ for flat space establishes it as a baseline or \"ground state\" for this entropy.\n- The minimizer $f_0$ for $\\mathcal{W}$ makes $(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, f_0)$ a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton. Such solitons are exact models for the asymptotic behavior of Type I singularities that can form under the Ricci flow.\n- The fact that Euclidean space admits such a soliton structure and has $\\mu=0$ solidifies its role as the fundamental model space against which formation of singularities in other geometries is measured. The non-negativity of Perelman's entropy for a large class of manifolds, $\\mu(g, \\tau) \\ge 0$, further highlights that flat space represents the lowest entropy state.\n\nThe exact value of $\\mu(g_{\\mathrm{Euc}}, \\tau)$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3006904"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical framework of non-collapsing relies on precise conditions, and understanding their necessity is as important as applying the theorems themselves.

In dimension $2$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\mathrm{Ric} = K g$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Ric} > 0$ on the entire manifold, which is a stronger condition than $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$. Consequently, the Bishop–Gromov theorem applies.\n\nThe volume of a geodesic ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin (where $t=0$) is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(o,R)) = \\int_{B_g(o,R)} dV_g = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R \\tanh t \\, dt \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi \\left[\\ln(\\cosh t)\\right]_0^R = 2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh R).\n$$\nFor large $R$, since $\\cosh R \\approx \\frac{1}{2} e^R$, we have $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(o,R)) \\approx 2\\pi \\ln(\\frac{1}{2}e^R) = 2\\pi (R-\\ln 2) \\approx 2\\pi R$. The volume grows linearly with the radius at large scales, not quadratically as in the Euclidean plane.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The Bishop–Gromov theorem with $\\mathrm{Ric}\\ge 0$ implies a uniform positive lower bound $\\inf_{x\\in M,\\,r0} \\operatorname{Vol}\\!\\left(B_{g}(x,r)\\right)/r^{n} \\ge c0$ on any complete manifold, so it guarantees $\\kappa$-noncollapsing at all scales without further hypotheses.**\n\nThe Bishop–Gromov theorem states that for a fixed point $x$, the ratio $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(x,r))/r^n$ is a non-increasing function of $r$. It does not imply that this ratio is uniformly bounded below by a positive constant $c > 0$ over all points $x$ and radii $r$. For the cigar soliton, let's consider the ball centered at the origin $o$. The volume ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(o,r))}{r^2} = \\frac{2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh r)}{r^2}.\n$$\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, using L'Hôpital's rule, this limit is:\n$$\n\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\frac{2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh r)}{r^2} = \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\frac{2\\pi \\tanh r}{2r} = \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\pi \\tanh r}{r} = 0,\n$$\nsince $\\tanh r \\to 1$. Thus, the infimum of the volume ratio over all $r0$ (even for a fixed point $x=o$) is $0$. The premise of the statement is false.\n**Verdict for A: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. In the cigar soliton, for points $p$ with $t_{0}\\to\\infty$, the ball volumes at the curvature scale satisfy $\\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}\\!\\left(B_{g_{\\mathrm{cig}}}(p,r)\\right)}{r^{2}} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; 0 \\quad \\text{as}\\quad r\\asymp \\cosh t_{0},\\;\\; t_{0}\\to\\infty, $ so there is collapsing at the curvature scale even though $K(p)\\to 0$.**\n\nLet $p$ be a point with geodesic coordinate $t_0 \\gg 1$. Let the radius be $r = c \\cosh t_0$ for some constant $c > 0$. The distance from the origin $o$ to $p$ is $t_0$. For $t_0$ large enough, $r = c \\cosh t_0 > t_0$. By the triangle inequality, the ball $B_g(p,r)$ is contained in the ball $B_g(o, t_0+r)$ and contains the ball $B_g(o, r-t_0)$.\nWe can bound the volume of $B_g(p,r)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(o, r-t_0)) \\le \\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(p,r)) \\le \\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(o, r+t_0)).\n$$\nUsing the volume formula for balls centered at the origin:\n$$\n2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh(r-t_0)) \\le \\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(p,r)) \\le 2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh(r+t_0)).\n$$\nWe analyze the ratio $\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(p,r))/r^2$. Let's examine the upper bound:\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(p,r))}{r^2} \\le \\frac{2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh(r+t_0))}{r^2} = \\frac{2\\pi \\ln(\\cosh(c \\cosh t_0 + t_0))}{(c \\cosh t_0)^2}.\n$$\nFor $t_0 \\to \\infty$, the argument of $\\ln \\cosh$ is dominated by $c \\cosh t_0$.\nThe numerator behaves like $2\\pi \\ln\\left(\\cosh(c \\cosh t_0)\\right) \\approx 2\\pi (c \\cosh t_0)$.\nThe denominator is $c^2 \\cosh^2 t_0$. The ratio is thus approximately\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi c \\cosh t_0}{c^2 \\cosh^2 t_0} = \\frac{2\\pi}{c \\cosh t_0}.\n$$\nAs $t_0 \\to \\infty$, this upper bound goes to $0$. Since the volume ratio is non-negative, by the squeeze theorem, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{t_0 \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}(B_g(p,r))}{r^2} = 0, \\quad \\text{for } r \\asymp \\cosh t_0.\n$$\nThis demonstrates volume collapse at the curvature scale $r \\asymp K(p)^{-1/2}$, even though the curvature at $p$, $K(p) = \\operatorname{sech}^2 t_0$, tends to $0$.\n**Verdict for B: Correct.**\n\n**C. The $\\kappa$-noncollapsing hypothesis requires the upper curvature bound $|\\mathrm{Rm}|\\le r^{-2}$ on the entire ball $B_{g}(x,r)$. For the cigar, when $r\\sim K(p)^{-1/2}$ and $t_{0}\\gg 1$, the ball $B_{g_{\\mathrm{cig}}}(p,r)$ contains regions where $K\\gg r^{-2}$ (near the origin), so the hypothesis fails; therefore Bishop–Gromov alone cannot enforce noncollapsing at this curvature scale.**\n\nLet's analyze this statement part by part.\n1.  The problem correctly states the definition of $\\kappa$-noncollapsing, which requires the curvature bound $|\\mathrm{Rm}| \\le r^{-2}$ (or $|K| \\le r^{-2}$ in 2D) to hold on the *entire* ball $B_g(x,r)$.\n2.  We consider a point $p$ at $t_0 \\gg 1$ and a radius $r \\asymp K(p)^{-1/2} = \\cosh t_0$. The condition for non-collapsing would be $K(q) \\le r^{-2} \\approx \\operatorname{sech}^2 t_0$ for all points $q \\in B_g(p,r)$.\n3.  As shown in the analysis for B, for large $t_0$, the radius $r \\approx \\cosh t_0$ is greater than the distance $t_0$ of $p$ from the origin. Thus, the ball $B_g(p,r)$ contains the origin $o$ (where $t=0$).\n4.  At the origin, the curvature is $K(0) = \\operatorname{sech}^2(0) = 1$.\n5.  The required curvature bound is $K(q) \\le \\operatorname{sech}^2 t_0$ for all $q \\in B_g(p,r)$. At the point $o \\in B_g(p,r)$, we have $K(o) = 1$. For $t_0 > 0$, $\\operatorname{sech}^2 t_0  1$. So the condition $K(o) \\le \\operatorname{sech}^2 t_0$ is violated. For $t_0 \\gg 1$, $1 \\gg \\operatorname{sech}^2 t_0$, so the violation is severe.\n6.  The hypothesis for $\\kappa$-noncollapsing fails. The conclusion \"therefore Bishop–Gromov alone cannot enforce noncollapsing at this curvature scale\" is also correct. The cigar soliton is a manifold with $\\mathrm{Ric} > 0$, so the Bishop-Gromov theorem applies. However, as shown in B, volume collapse occurs at the specified scale. This provides a direct counterexample to the idea that the Bishop-Gromov theorem by itself is sufficient to prevent such collapse. The statement accurately identifies the reason why non-collapsing theorems do not apply to this situation.\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\n**D. The cigar soliton has negative Ricci curvature at infinity, so the Bishop–Gromov theorem does not apply there; this failure explains the collapse at large scales.**\n\nThe Ricci curvature is $\\mathrm{Ric} = K g$ with $K(t) = \\operatorname{sech}^2 t$. The function $\\operatorname{sech}^2 t$ is strictly positive for all real $t$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $K(t) \\to 0$, but it approaches $0$ from the positive side. The Ricci curvature is positive everywhere on the manifold. The statement that it has negative Ricci curvature is factually incorrect. The Bishop-Gromov theorem (for $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$) applies everywhere on the cigar. The collapse is not due to a failure of the theorem's hypothesis.\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If one strengthens $\\mathrm{Ric}\\ge 0$ by adding a uniform upper curvature bound $|\\mathrm{Rm}|\\le r^{-2}$ on $B_{g}(x,r)$, the Bishop–Gromov theorem by itself yields $\\operatorname{Vol}\\!\\left(B_{g}(x,r)\\right)\\ge \\kappa r^{n}$ for some $\\kappa0$, with no further geometric input.**\n\nThis statement suggests that the non-collapsing property is a simple consequence of the Bishop-Gromov theorem once the curvature bound hypothesis is added. This is a mischaracterization of the theory. The Bishop-Gromov theorem leverages a *lower* bound on Ricci curvature to establish the *monotonicity* of the volume ratio, which yields a volume *upper* bound. In contrast, non-collapsing theorems (e.g., Cheeger's finiteness theorem, Perelman's non-collapsing theorem) use both a lower Ricci curvature bound and an upper sectional curvature bound to establish a volume *lower* bound. The proofs of these non-collapsing results are considerably more complex than the proof of the Bishop-Gromov theorem and involve different techniques (e.g., harmonic radius estimates). The Bishop-Gromov theorem \"by itself\" does not utilize an upper curvature bound and cannot single-handedly produce a volume lower bound. The statement misattributes a deep and difficult result to a more elementary one.\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{BC}}$$", "id": "3006913"}]}
