A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe problem asks for the solution to the Ricci flow equation $\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$ with the initial condition $g(0) = g_{0}$ on the 3-sphere $S^{3}$, where $g_{0}$ is the round metric.\n\nFirst, we characterize the initial metric $g_{0}$. The round metric on a sphere has constant sectional curvature. A metric with constant sectional curvature is necessarily an Einstein metric. An Einstein metric $g$ is defined by the condition that its Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric itself:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g) = \\lambda g\n$$\nfor some constant $\\lambda$. For the initial metric $g_{0}$, we have:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) = \\lambda_{0} g_{0}\n$$\nThe constant $\\lambda_{0}$ can be related to the scalar curvature, $R(g_{0})$. The scalar curvature is the trace of the Ricci tensor with respect to the metric. For a manifold of dimension $n$, this is $R = \\operatorname{tr}_{g}(\\operatorname{Ric}) = g^{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$. Given $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\lambda g_{ij}$, the scalar curvature is:\n$$\nR = g^{ij}(\\lambda g_{ij}) = \\lambda g^{ij}g_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta^{i}_{i} = \\lambda n\n$$\nThe problem is set on $S^{3}$, so the dimension is $n=3$. Therefore, for the initial metric, we have the relation:\n$$\nR(g_{0}) = 3 \\lambda_{0} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda_{0} = \\frac{R(g_{0})}{3}\n$$\nThus, the Ricci tensor of the initial metric is explicitly given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) = \\frac{R(g_{0})}{3} g_{0}\n$$\nSince the initial metric is the round metric on a sphere, its Ricci curvature is positive, which implies $R(g_{0}) > 0$.\n\nThe high degree of symmetry of the initial condition suggests an ansatz for the solution of the form:\n$$\ng(t) = c(t) g_{0}\n$$\nwhere $c(t)$ is a time-dependent scaling function with $c(0)=1$ to satisfy the initial condition $g(0) = 1 \\cdot g_{0} = g_{0}$. This ansatz assumes that the Ricci flow preserves the Einstein property of the metric, only rescaling its overall size.\n\nWe now analyze the terms of the Ricci flow equation under this ansatz. The left-hand side is the time derivative of $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} (c(t) g_{0}) = \\frac{dc}{dt} g_{0} = c'(t) g_{0}\n$$\nFor the right-hand side, we need to compute $\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\operatorname{Ric}(c(t) g_{0})$. The problem directs us to use the scaling behavior of curvature. For a metric $\\tilde{g} = Cg$ where $C$ is a positive constant, the components of the Ricci tensor are invariant: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}(\\tilde{g}) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}(g)$. In our case, for any fixed time $t$, $c(t)$ is a spatially constant scaling factor. Therefore, the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$ is identical to the Ricci tensor of $g_{0}$ as a $(0,2)$-tensor field:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0})\n$$\nSubstituting our known expression for $\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0})$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{R(g_{0})}{3} g_{0}\n$$\nNow, we substitute both sides back into the Ricci flow equation $\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$:\n$$\nc'(t) g_{0} = -2 \\left( \\frac{R(g_{0})}{3} g_{0} \\right)\n$$\nThis is an equation between two $(0,2)$-tensors. Since $g_{0}$ is a non-degenerate metric field, we can equate the scalar coefficients:\n$$\nc'(t) = -\\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $c(t)$. We can solve it by direct integration with respect to time $t$:\n$$\nc(t) = \\int -\\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3} \\, dt = -\\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3} t + K\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. We determine $K$ using the initial condition $c(0)=1$:\n$$\nc(0) = -\\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3} (0) + K = 1 \\implies K=1\n$$\nSo, the scaling function is:\n$$\nc(t) = 1 - \\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3} t\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our ansatz gives the explicit closed-form expression for the metric $g(t)$:\n$$\ng(t) = \\left(1 - \\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3} t\\right) g_{0}\n$$\nThis solution is valid as long as the metric remains a Riemannian metric, which means the scaling factor $c(t)$ must be positive. The extinction time $T$ is the time when the metric degenerates, i.e., when $c(T)=0$.\n$$\n1 - \\frac{2 R(g_{0})}{3} T = 0 \\implies T = \\frac{3}{2 R(g_{0})}\n$$\nSince $R(g_{0}) > 0$, the extinction time is positive and finite.

The information provided is sufficient and consistent for a full derivation.\n\nThis problem is divided into two parts. First, we will derive the explicit extinction time for the Ricci flow on a round $3$-sphere by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for its radius. Second, we will derive an upper bound for the extinction time using the maximum principle and verify that it matches the explicit time.\n\n### Part 1: Explicit Calculation of Extinction Time\n\nThe Ricci flow is defined by the evolution equation for the metric tensor $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nThe initial condition is a round metric $g(0)$ on the $3$-sphere $S^3$ with constant sectional curvature $K(0) = 1/r_0^2$, where $r_0$ is the initial radius. The Ricci flow preserves the property of being a round metric. Therefore, for any time $t \\ge 0$, the metric $g(t)$ is a round metric on $S^3$ with some radius $r(t)$. The sectional curvature at time $t$ is $K(t) = 1/r(t)^2$.\n\nFor a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ with constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ is given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1) K g$. In our case, the dimension is $n=3$, so the Ricci tensor of the metric $g(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (3-1) K(t) g(t) = 2 \\frac{1}{r(t)^2} g(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Ricci flow equation gives:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\left( \\frac{2}{r(t)^2} g(t) \\right) = -\\frac{4}{r(t)^2} g(t)\n$$\nTo obtain an ODE for the radius $r(t)$, we can express the time-dependent metric $g(t)$ in terms of a fixed reference metric. Let $g_{std}$ be the standard metric of the unit-radius sphere. Then the metric $g(t)$ corresponding to a sphere of radius $r(t)$ is $g(t) = r(t)^2 g_{std}$. Taking the time derivative, we get:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( r(t)^2 g_{std} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} r(t)^2 \\right) g_{std} = 2 r(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} g_{std}\n$$\nNow we equate our two expressions for $\\partial_t g(t)$:\n$$\n2 r(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} g_{std} = -\\frac{4}{r(t)^2} g(t) = -\\frac{4}{r(t)^2} (r(t)^2 g_{std}) = -4 g_{std}\n$$\nThis implies the following ODE for $r(t)$:\n$$\n2 r(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} = -4\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\frac{d}{dt} (r(t)^2) = -4$. Integrating this equation with respect to time $t$ yields:\n$$\nr(t)^2 = -4t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. We use the initial condition $r(0) = r_0$ to determine $C$:\n$$\nr(0)^2 = r_0^2 = -4(0) + C \\implies C = r_0^2\n$$\nThus, the evolution of the squared radius is given by:\n$$\nr(t)^2 = r_0^2 - 4t\n$$\nThe extinction time $T$ is the time at which the manifold collapses to a point, which corresponds to the radius becoming zero, $r(T)=0$. Setting $t=T$ and $r(T)=0$ in the equation above:\n$$\n0 = r_0^2 - 4T\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we find the explicit extinction time:\n$$\nT = \\frac{r_0^2}{4}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Bound from the Maximum Principle and Verification\n\nThe evolution equation for the scalar curvature $R$ under the Ricci flow in any dimension $n$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} R = \\Delta R + 2 |\\operatorname{Ric}|^2\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator with respect to the metric $g(t)$, and $|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 = g^{ik}g^{jl}R_{ij}R_{kl}$ is the squared norm of the Ricci tensor. We are given the pointwise inequality $|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{n} R^2$. For dimension $n=3$, this becomes:\n$$\n|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{3} R^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the scalar curvature evolution equation gives a differential inequality:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} R \\geq \\Delta R + \\frac{2}{3} R^2\n$$\nLet $R_{min}(t) = \\inf_{x \\in S^3} R(x, t)$. By the maximum principle, at a point $(x_t, t)$ where the spatial minimum of $R$ is achieved, we have $\\Delta R(x_t, t) \\geq 0$. Therefore, at this point, the time derivative of $R$ must satisfy:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} R(x_t, t) \\geq \\frac{2}{3} (R(x_t, t))^2\n$$\nThis implies that the function $R_{min}(t)$ must satisfy the differential inequality $\\frac{d}{dt} R_{min}(t) \\geq \\frac{2}{3} (R_{min}(t))^2$ (in a weak sense).\nLet's analyze the corresponding ODE, $\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{2}{3} u^2$, with initial condition $u(0) = R_{min}(0)$. This is a separable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{u^2} = \\frac{2}{3} dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{u(0)}^{u(t)} \\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{\\tilde{u}^2} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{2}{3} d\\tilde{t} \\implies \\left[-\\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}}\\right]_{u(0)}^{u(t)} = \\frac{2}{3} t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{u(t)} + \\frac{1}{u(0)} = \\frac{2}{3} t \\implies u(t) = \\frac{u(0)}{1 - \\frac{2}{3} u(0) t}\n$$\nBy the comparison principle for ODEs, since $R_{min}'(t) \\ge \\frac{2}{3} R_{min}(t)^2$ and $u'(t) = \\frac{2}{3} u(t)^2$, we have $R_{min}(t) \\geq u(t)$ as long as the solution exists. The solution $u(t)$ blows up to infinity when its denominator is zero, i.e., at time $t = \\frac{3}{2u(0)}$. Since the scalar curvature must remain finite for a smooth solution, the maximal existence time $T$ of the Ricci flow must be bounded by this blow-up time:\n$$\nT \\leq \\frac{3}{2 R_{min}(0)} = \\frac{3}{2 \\inf_{S^3} R(\\cdot, 0)}\n$$\nNow we evaluate this bound for our initial condition. The initial metric has constant sectional curvature $K = 1/r_0^2$. The scalar curvature $R$ of a manifold of dimension $n$ with constant sectional curvature $K$ is $R = n(n-1)K$. For $n=3$, our initial scalar curvature is:\n$$\nR(\\cdot, 0) = 3(3-1)\\frac{1}{r_0^2} = \\frac{6}{r_0^2}\n$$\nSince this is constant over $S^3$, we have $\\inf_{S^3} R(\\cdot, 0) = \\frac{6}{r_0^2}$.\nSubstituting this value into our upper bound for $T$:\n$$\nT \\leq \\frac{3}{2 \\left( \\frac{6}{r_0^2} \\right)} = \\frac{3 r_0^2}{12} = \\frac{r_0^2}{4}\n$$\nThis upper bound on the maximal existence time, $T \\leq \\frac{r_0^2}{4}$, agrees perfectly with the exact extinction time $T = \\frac{r_0^2}{4}$ derived in the first part. This agreement is expected because for the round sphere metric, which is an Einstein metric, the inequality $|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{n} R^2$ becomes an equality. Furthermore, because the scalar curvature $R(t)$ is spatially constant for all time, $\\Delta R(t) = 0$. Consequently, the evolution of $R(t)$ satisfies the ODE $\\frac{d R}{dt} = \\frac{2}{3} R^2$ exactly.\nThe final answer is the expression for the extinction time $T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{r_0^2}{4}}$$", "id": "2978478"}, {"introduction": "Hamilton's theorem hinges on the remarkable fact that for a 3-manifold, positive Ricci curvature is not just preserved but improved by the flow.

This provides a direct algebraic relationship between the Riemann curvature tensor $R$, the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$, the scalar curvature $S$, and the metric $g$. In component form, for an orthonormal basis, this relationship is:\n$$\nR_{ijkl} = (\\delta_{ik}R_{jl} - \\delta_{il}R_{jk} + \\delta_{jl}R_{ik} - \\delta_{jk}R_{il}) - \\frac{S}{2}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})\n$$\nwhere $R_{ij}$ are the components of the Ricci tensor and $S = \\operatorname{tr}_g(\\mathrm{Ric}) = R_{kk}$ is the scalar curvature.\nIn the given orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ that diagonalizes the Ricci tensor, we have $R_{ij} = \\lambda_i \\delta_{ij}$. The scalar curvature is $S = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$.\n\nThe curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}$ acts on the space of $2$-forms $\\Lambda^2 T_pM$. This is a $3$-dimensional vector space. A natural orthonormal basis for this space is given by $\\{ \\omega_{23}, \\omega_{31}, \\omega_{12} \\}$, where $\\omega_{ij} = e_i \\wedge e_j$.\n\nWe now find the matrix of $\\mathcal{R}$ in this basis. The matrix entries are given by $\\mathcal{R}_{AB} = \\langle \\mathcal{R}(\\omega_A), \\omega_B \\rangle$, assuming this basis is orthonormal with respect to the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. The problem defines the action of $\\mathcal{R}$ via the formula $\\langle \\mathcal{R}(\\omega),\\eta\\rangle = R_{ijkl}\\,\\omega_{ij}\\,\\eta_{kl}$.

We compute the off-diagonal terms of the matrix of $\\mathcal{R}$. For example, consider the entry corresponding to $\\omega_{12}$ and $\\omega_{23}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathcal{R}(\\omega_{12}), \\omega_{23} \\rangle = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} R_{ijkl}(\\omega_{12})_{ij}(\\omega_{23})_{kl}\n$$\nThe non-zero components for $(\\omega_{12})_{ij}$ are for $(i,j)=(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$. For $(\\omega_{23})_{kl}$ they are for $(k,l)=(2,3)$ and $(3,2)$. The sum expands to terms involving $R_{1223}$, $R_{1232}$, $R_{2123}$, and $R_{2132}$. All of these are multiples of $R_{1223}$. Let's compute $R_{1223}$ using the formula for the Riemann tensor:\n$$\nR_{1223} = (\\delta_{12}R_{23} - \\delta_{13}R_{22} + \\delta_{22}R_{13} - \\delta_{23}R_{12}) - \\frac{S}{2}(\\delta_{12}\\delta_{23} - \\delta_{13}\\delta_{22})\n$$\nSince we are in an orthonormal basis where the Ricci tensor is diagonal, all terms are zero: $\\delta_{ij}=0$ for $i\\ne j$ and $R_{ij}=0$ for $i\\ne j$. Thus, $R_{1223}=0$. By symmetry, all off-diagonal elements of the matrix of $\\mathcal{R}$ in this basis are zero. Therefore, $\\{\\omega_{23}, \\omega_{31}, \\omega_{12}\\}$ is an eigenbasis for $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries. Let's compute one, for $\\omega_{12}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{(12)} = \\langle \\mathcal{R}(\\omega_{12}), \\omega_{12} \\rangle = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} R_{ijkl}(\\omega_{12})_{ij}(\\omega_{12})_{kl}\n$$\nThe non-zero components are $(\\omega_{12})_{12}=1$ and $(\\omega_{12})_{21}=-1$.

From the formula for $R_{ijkl}$:\n$$\nK_{12} = R_{1212} = (R_{11} + R_{22}) - \\frac{S}{2} = \\lambda_1+\\lambda_2 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2+\\lambda_3) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2-\\lambda_3)\n$$\nSo, the eigenvalue associated with $\\omega_{12}$ is $\\mu_{(12)} = 4 K_{12} = 2(\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2-\\lambda_3)$.\nBy cyclic permutation of indices, the three eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{R}$ are:\n$$\n\\mu_{(12)} = 2(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3) \\\\\n\\mu_{(23)} = 2(\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1) \\\\\n\\mu_{(31)} = 2(\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2)\n$$\nGiven the ordering $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\lambda_3 > 0$, we can determine the largest and smallest eigenvalues.\nLet's compare them.\n$\\mu_{(12)} - \\mu_{(31)} = 2(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3) - 2(\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2) = 4(\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3) \\geq 0$.\n$\\mu_{(31)} - \\mu_{(23)} = 2(\\lambda_3 + \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2) - 2(\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1) = 4(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2) \\geq 0$.\nThus, $\\mu_{(12)} \\geq \\mu_{(31)} \\geq \\mu_{(23)}$.\nThe maximum and minimum eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\max} = \\mu_{(12)} = 2(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3) \\\\\n\\mu_{\\min} = \\mu_{(23)} = 2(\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the optimal lower bound for the ratio $\\rho = \\frac{\\mu_{\\min}}{\\mu_{\\max}}$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{2(\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1)}{2(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3)} = \\frac{\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1}{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3}\n$$\nWe need to find the infimum of this expression subject to the constraints:\n$1.$ $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\lambda_3 > 0$\n$2.$ $\\lambda_3 \\geq \\delta\\,\\lambda_1$ for $\\delta \\in [\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n\nThe expression for $\\rho$ is homogeneous of degree $0$ in the variables $\\lambda_i$. This means we can normalize one of them without loss of generality. Let's set $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The constraints become:\n$1.$ $1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\lambda_3 > 0$\n$2.$ $\\lambda_3 \\geq \\delta$\nCombining these, we have $1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\lambda_3 \\geq \\delta$. The domain for $(\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ is a triangle in the $\\lambda_2\\lambda_3$-plane.\nThe function to minimize is:\n$$\nf(\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = \\frac{\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - 1}{1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3}\n$$\nWe analyze the behavior of $f$ over the domain $D = \\{(\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) | 1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\lambda_3 \\geq \\delta\\}$. We compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\lambda_2} = \\frac{(1)(1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3) - (\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - 1)(1)}{(1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3)^2} = \\frac{2 - 2\\lambda_3}{(1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3)^2}\n$$\nSince $\\lambda_3 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\leq 1$, we have $1 - \\lambda_3 \\geq 0$, so $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\lambda_2} \\geq 0$. The function is non-decreasing with respect to $\\lambda_2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\lambda_3} = \\frac{(1)(1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3) - (\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 - 1)(-1)}{(1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3)^2} = \\frac{2\\lambda_2}{(1 + \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3)^2}\n$$\nSince $\\lambda_2 \\geq \\lambda_3 \\geq \\delta \\geq \\frac{1}{2} > 0$, we have $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\lambda_3} > 0$. The function is strictly increasing with respect to $\\lambda_3$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $f(\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ on the domain $D$, we should choose the smallest possible values for both $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$. The domain is the triangle with vertices $(\\delta, \\delta)$, $(1, \\delta)$, and $(1,1)$. The minimum value for both variables is achieved at the vertex $(\\delta, \\delta)$.\nSo, the minimum occurs when $\\lambda_2 = \\delta$ and $\\lambda_3 = \\delta$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the function $f$:\n$$\n\\rho(\\delta) = f(\\delta, \\delta) = \\frac{\\delta + \\delta - 1}{1 + \\delta - \\delta} = 2\\delta - 1\n$$\nThis corresponds to the choice $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3) = (c, c\\delta, c\\delta)$ for any $c>0$, which satisfies all constraints.\nFor $\\delta=1/2$, the lower bound is $0$. This case corresponds to $\\mu_{\\min}=0$, where the manifold can be flat in one plane direction.\nFor $\\delta=1$, the lower bound is $1$. This corresponds to the Einstein case $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3$, where all sectional curvatures are equal, so $\\mu_{\\min}=\\mu_{\\max}$.\n\nThe optimal lower bound for the ratio $\\rho(\\delta)$ is $2\\delta-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\delta - 1}\n$$", "id": "2978473"}]}
