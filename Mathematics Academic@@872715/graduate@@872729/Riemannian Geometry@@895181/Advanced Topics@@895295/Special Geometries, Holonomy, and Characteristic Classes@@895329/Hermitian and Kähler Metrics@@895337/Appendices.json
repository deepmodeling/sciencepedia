In local holomorphic coordinates $\\{z^j\\}$, the Hermitian metric is specified by the components $g_{j\\bar{k}} = g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^j}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}^k})$. The problem states that these components are the entries of a constant positive-definite Hermitian matrix $H$, so $g_{j\\bar{k}} = H_{j\\bar{k}}$.\n\nThe fundamental $2$-form $\\omega$ associated with the Hermitian metric $g$ is a real $(1,1)$-form. Its definition is $\\omega(X,Y) = g_R(JX, Y)$, where $g_R$ is the associated Riemannian metric, which is the real part of the Hermitian metric. In local holomorphic coordinates, this form is given by the standard expression:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} g_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}\n$$\nIn our case, the components $g_{j\\bar{k}} = H_{j\\bar{k}}$ are constants. Substituting this into the expression for $\\omega$ gives:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}\n$$\nTo show that this metric is Kähler, we must demonstrate that $\\omega$ is a closed form, i.e., its exterior derivative $\\mathrm{d}\\omega$ is zero. We compute the exterior derivative:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\mathrm{d} \\left( \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k} \\right)\n$$\nSince the exterior derivative is a linear operator and the components $H_{j\\bar{k}}$ are constants, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\, \\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k})\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the exterior derivative (Leibniz rule), we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}) = (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j})) \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k} - \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge (\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}))\n$$\nA fundamental property of the exterior derivative is that $\\mathrm{d}^2 = 0$. The coordinate functions $z^j$ and $\\bar{z}^k$ are $0$-forms. Their derivatives, $\\mathrm{d}z^j$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^k$, are $1$-forms. Applying the exterior derivative again yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j}) = \\mathrm{d}^2 z^{j} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}) = \\mathrm{d}^2 \\bar{z}^{k} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back, we find:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k}) = 0 \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^{k} - \\mathrm{d}z^{j} \\wedge 0 = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} H_{j\\bar{k}} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$, the form $\\omega$ is closed. A Hermitian metric whose fundamental $2$-form is closed is, by definition, a Kähler metric. Thus, the given metric $g$ together with the complex structure $J$ defines a Kähler structure on $\\mathbb{C}^n$.\n\nPart 2: Compute the Ricci form $\\rho$.\n\nThe problem provides the definition of the Ricci form $\\rho$ of a Kähler metric in local holomorphic coordinates as:\n$$\n\\rho = -i \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log(\\det(g_{j\\bar{k}}))\n$$\nwhere $\\partial$ and $\\bar{\\partial}$ are the Dolbeault operators. The action of $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$ on a function $f$ is given by:\n$$\n\\partial \\bar{\\partial} f = \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^j \\partial \\bar{z}^k} \\mathrm{d}z^j \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^k\n$$\nIn this problem, the components of the metric tensor are given by the constant matrix $H$, i.e., $g_{j\\bar{k}} = H_{j\\bar{k}}$. Let $G$ be the matrix with these components. Then the determinant, $\\det(G) = \\det(H_{j\\bar{k}})$, is the determinant of a constant matrix. Consequently, $\\det(g_{j\\bar{k}})$ is a constant value. Let's denote this constant by $C$.\n$$\nC = \\det(g_{j\\bar{k}})\n$$\nSince $H$ is a positive-definite Hermitian matrix, its determinant $C$ is a positive real constant.\n\nWe now evaluate the function inside the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$ operator:\n$$\nf(z^1, \\dots, z^n) = \\log(\\det(g_{j\\bar{k}})) = \\log(C)\n$$\nThis function $f$ is a constant function on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. We compute its second-order partial derivatives with respect to the complex coordinates $z^j$ and $\\bar{z}^k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}^k} = \\frac{\\partial (\\log C)}{\\partial \\bar{z}^k} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^j \\partial \\bar{z}^k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^j} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bar{z}^k} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^j}(0) = 0\n$$\nSince all second-order partial derivatives are zero, the $(1,1)$-form $\\partial \\bar{\\partial} f$ is identically zero:\n$$\n\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log(\\det(g_{j\\bar{k}})) = \\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} 0 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}z^j \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^k = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the definition of the Ricci form, we get:\n$$\n\\rho = -i \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThe Ricci form is the zero $2$-form.\n\nThis result can be interpreted in the context of the geometry of the metric. The metric $g$ is described as \"flat\". A flat metric possesses a vanishing Riemann curvature tensor. The Christoffel symbols for this metric, calculated in the global coordinate system $\\{z^j\\}$, are $\\Gamma^p_{jk} = g^{p\\bar{q}} \\frac{\\partial g_{j\\bar{q}}}{\\partial z^k}$. Since the metric components $g_{j\\bar{q}}=H_{j\\bar{q}}$ are constants, their derivatives are zero, which implies that all Christoffel symbols vanish. The components of the Riemann curvature tensor are expressions involving the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives. If all $\\Gamma^p_{jk}$ are zero, the Riemann tensor is identically zero.\n\nThe Ricci curvature tensor, $R_{j\\bar{k}}$, is a contraction of the Riemann tensor. Therefore, if the Riemann tensor is zero, the Ricci tensor must also be zero. For a Kähler metric, the components of the Ricci tensor are related to the potential function $\\log(\\det(g_{p\\bar{q}}))$ by $R_{j\\bar{k}} = -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^j \\partial \\bar{z}^k} \\log(\\det(g_{p\\bar{q}}))$. Our calculation confirms that $R_{j\\bar{k}}=0$ for all $j,k$. The Ricci form $\\rho$ is constructed from the Ricci tensor components as $\\rho = i \\sum_{j,k} R_{j\\bar{k}} \\mathrm{d}z^j \\wedge \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}^k$. A vanishing Ricci tensor thus directly implies a vanishing Ricci form, $\\rho=0$.

Calculate $d\\omega$ (Kähler condition):**\nUsing the product rule $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta - \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} d(\\varphi^{k} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{k}) = \\frac{i}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (d\\varphi^{k} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{k} - \\varphi^{k} \\wedge d\\overline{\\varphi}^{k}).\n$$\nWe evaluate each term in the sum:\n-   For $k=1$: $d\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} - \\varphi^{1} \\wedge d\\overline{\\varphi}^{1} = 0 \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} - \\varphi^{1} \\wedge 0 = 0$.\n-   For $k=2$: $d\\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2} - \\varphi^{2} \\wedge d\\overline{\\varphi}^{2} = 0 \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2} - \\varphi^{2} \\wedge 0 = 0$.\n-   For $k=3$: $d\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3} - \\varphi^{3} \\wedge d\\overline{\\varphi}^{3} = (\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2}) \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3} - \\varphi^{3} \\wedge (\\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2})$.\n\nSumming these results gives:\n$$\nd\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\left( \\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3} - \\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2} \\right).\n$$\nSince $\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}$ is a $(2,1)$-form and $\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}$ is a $(1,2)$-form, they are linearly independent, and thus $d\\omega \\neq 0$. Therefore, the metric is **not Kähler**.\n\n**2. Calculate $d(\\omega^2)$ (Balanced condition):**\nWe first compute $\\omega^2 = \\omega \\wedge \\omega$. Let $\\eta_k = \\frac{i}{2} \\varphi^k \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^k$. Then $\\omega = \\eta_1 + \\eta_2 + \\eta_3$. Since $\\varphi^k$ and $\\overline{\\varphi}^k$ are $1$-forms, $\\eta_k \\wedge \\eta_k = (\\frac{i}{2})^2 (\\varphi^k \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^k) \\wedge (\\varphi^k \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^k) = 0$.\nSo, $\\omega^2 = (\\eta_1+\\eta_2+\\eta_3) \\wedge (\\eta_1+\\eta_2+\\eta_3) = 2(\\eta_1 \\wedge \\eta_2 + \\eta_1 \\wedge \\eta_3 + \\eta_2 \\wedge \\eta_3)$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the property $d(\\omega^2) = d(\\omega \\wedge \\omega) = d\\omega \\wedge \\omega + (-1)^{\\deg\\omega} \\omega \\wedge d\\omega$. Since $\\omega$ is a $2$-form, $\\deg\\omega=2$, so $d(\\omega^2) = 2 d\\omega \\wedge \\omega$.\nWe have $d\\omega$ from above. We wedge it with $\\omega$:\n$$\nd\\omega \\wedge \\omega = \\frac{i}{2} \\left( \\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3} - \\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2} \\right) \\wedge \\frac{i}{2} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\varphi^{k} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{k} \\right).\n$$\nLet's examine the terms. The first part of $d\\omega$ is $\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}$. When wedged with any of the terms $\\varphi^{k} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{k}$, it results in zero because a basis form is repeated. For example:\n-   $(\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}) \\wedge (\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1}) = 0$ due to the repeated $\\varphi^1$.\n-   $(\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}) \\wedge (\\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}) = 0$ due to the repeated $\\varphi^2$.\n-   $(\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}) \\wedge (\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}) = 0$ due to the repeated $\\overline{\\varphi}^3$.\n\nSimilarly, the second part of $d\\omega$, which is $-\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}$, also gives zero when wedged with any term $\\varphi^{k} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{k}$.\n-   $(\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}) \\wedge (\\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1}) = 0$ due to the repeated $\\overline{\\varphi}^1$.\n-   $(\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}) \\wedge (\\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}) = 0$ due to the repeated $\\overline{\\varphi}^2$.\n-   $(\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2}) \\wedge (\\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3}) = 0$ due to the repeated $\\varphi^3$.\n\nTherefore, $d\\omega \\wedge \\omega = 0$, which implies $d(\\omega^2) = 0$. The metric is **balanced**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A Hermitian metric on a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$ is balanced precisely when $d\\omega^{n-1} = 0$.**\nThis statement is a verbatim repetition of the definition of a balanced metric provided in the problem statement. As such, within the context of the problem, it is definitionally true. It also matches the standard definition in the mathematical literature.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. On the Iwasawa manifold with the above left-invariant $\\omega$, one has $d\\omega^{2} = 0$ but $d\\omega \\neq 0$, so the metric is balanced and non-Kähler.**\nOur derivation shows that for the given metric on the Iwasawa manifold (where $n=3$), $d\\omega \\neq 0$ and $d(\\omega^{3-1}) = d(\\omega^2) = 0$. The statement's claims align perfectly with our calculations. The conclusion that the metric is balanced ($d\\omega^2=0$) and non-Kähler ($d\\omega\\neq 0$) is therefore correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. For the above $\\omega$ on the Iwasawa manifold, $d\\omega = 0$, hence the metric is Kähler.**\nOur calculation explicitly showed that $d\\omega = \\frac{i}{2} ( \\varphi^{1} \\wedge \\varphi^{2} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{3} - \\varphi^{3} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{1} \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^{2} ) \\neq 0$. This statement is a direct contradiction of our findings.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For the above $\\omega$ on the Iwasawa manifold, $d\\omega^{2} \\neq 0$, so the metric is not balanced.**\nOur calculation showed that $d(\\omega^2)=0$. This statement directly contradicts our finding. The metric is balanced.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Any complex parallelizable manifold is Kähler.**\nA manifold is Kähler if it admits *any* Kähler metric. A complex parallelizable manifold admits a global holomorphic frame. The Iwasawa manifold is given as an example of a complex parallelizable manifold. We have shown that one particular metric is not Kähler. To disprove this statement, we must show that the Iwasawa manifold admits *no* Kähler metric whatsoever.\nA fundamental property of compact Kähler manifolds is the Hodge symmetry $h^{p,q} = h^{q,p}$, where $h^{p,q}$ are the Hodge numbers (dimensions of Dolbeault cohomology groups $H^{p,q}_{\\bar{\\partial}}(M)$). For the Iwasawa manifold, the Hodge numbers can be computed from the Lie algebra cohomology.\nThe space of holomorphic $1$-forms $H^{1,0}_{\\bar{\\partial}}$ is spanned by the classes of $\\varphi^1, \\varphi^2, \\varphi^3$, so $h^{1,0}=3$.\nThe space of antiholomorphic $1$-forms $H^{0,1}_{\\bar{\\partial}}$ is spanned by the classes of $\\bar{\\partial}$-closed $(0,1)$-forms modulo $\\bar{\\partial}$-exact forms. Since $\\bar{\\partial}\\overline{\\varphi}^1=0$, $\\bar{\\partial}\\overline{\\varphi}^2=0$, and $\\bar{\\partial}\\overline{\\varphi}^3=\\overline{\\varphi}^1 \\wedge \\overline{\\varphi}^2$, the closed forms are spanned by $\\overline{\\varphi}^1$ and $\\overline{\\varphi}^2$. As there are no exact invariant $(0,1)$-forms, $h^{0,1}=2$.\nSince $h^{1,0} = 3 \\neq h^{0,1} = 2$, Hodge symmetry fails. Therefore, the Iwasawa manifold cannot admit any Kähler metric. This provides a direct counterexample to the statement.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2979139"}]}
