The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and provides all necessary definitions. Therefore, it is valid and we may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe isoperimetric profile of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is defined as the function $I_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(v)$ which gives the infimum of the perimeter for all measurable sets of a given volume $v  0$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(v) \\coloneqq \\inf\\{ \\mathrm{Per}(E) : E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\text{ measurable},\\ \\mathrm{Vol}(E) = v \\}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathrm{Vol}(E)$ is the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure and $\\mathrm{Per}(E)$ is the perimeter in the sense of sets of finite variation (BV theory).\n\nThe problem suggests using the method of Schwarz symmetrization (or spherical decreasing rearrangement). Let $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a measurable set with finite, positive volume $\\mathrm{Vol}(E) = v$. Its Schwarz symmetrization, denoted $E^*$, is defined as the open ball centered at the origin having the same volume as $E$. That is, $E^* = B_R(0)$, the ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin, where $R$ is chosen such that $\\mathrm{Vol}(B_R(0)) = v$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in geometric measure theory, a generalization of the Polya-Szego inequality, states that the perimeter of a set does not increase under Schwarz symmetrization. For any set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ with finite perimeter, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Per}(E^*) \\le \\mathrm{Per}(E)\n$$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{Vol}(E^*) = \\mathrm{Vol}(E) = v$. This inequality implies that for any set $E$ considered in the infimum problem, there exists a ball $E^*$ of the same volume whose perimeter is smaller or equal. Consequently, the infimum of the perimeter must be attained by a ball. The sets which attain this infimum, known as isoperimetric minimizers, are therefore Euclidean balls.\n\nTo find the explicit form of $I_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(v)$, we need to calculate the perimeter of a ball in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as a function of its volume $v$. Let $B_R$ be a ball of radius $R$. Its volume is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}(B_R) = \\omega_n R^n\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_n$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The perimeter of this ball, which is the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume (or surface area) of its boundary sphere $\\partial B_R$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Per}(B_R) = n \\omega_n R^{n-1}\n$$\nWe are given that the ball has volume $v$. We can thus express the radius $R$ in terms of $v$:\n$$\nv = \\omega_n R^n \\implies R^n = \\frac{v}{\\omega_n} \\implies R = \\left(\\frac{v}{\\omega_n}\\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $R$ into the formula for the perimeter yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Per}(B_R) = n \\omega_n \\left( \\left(\\frac{v}{\\omega_n}\\right)^{1/n} \\right)^{n-1} = n \\omega_n \\left(\\frac{v}{\\omega_n}\\right)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Per}(B_R) = n \\omega_n v^{\\frac{n-1}{n}} (\\omega_n)^{-\\frac{n-1}{n}} = n \\omega_n^{1 - \\frac{n-1}{n}} v^{\\frac{n-1}{n}} = n \\omega_n^{\\frac{1}{n}} v^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}\n$$\nSince balls are the minimizers, this value is precisely the infimum for a given volume $v$. Thus, the isoperimetric profile is:\n$$\nI_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(v) = n \\omega_n^{1/n} v^{(n-1)/n}\n$$\nThe sets that attain this infimum are, up to null sets and translations, the Euclidean balls of volume $v$.\n\nFinally, the classical Euclidean isoperimetric inequality is a direct consequence of the definition of the isoperimetric profile. For any measurable set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ of finite perimeter, we have $\\mathrm{Per}(E) \\ge I_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}(\\mathrm{Vol}(E))$.

For small $v$, the isoperimetric profile is given by the perimeter of the corresponding geodesic ball $B_{p_0}(r)$, so $I_{M}(v) = P(B_{p_0}(r))$.\n\nFirst, we find the asymptotic expansion for the perimeter $P(r) = P(B_{p_0}(r))$ by differentiating the volume expansion with respect to the radius $r$.

Infinitude of the Perimeter $P_{M}(E)$**\n\nThe set $E$ is a countable union of disjoint sets $E_k = \\varphi(R_k \\times B)$. The sets $E_k$ are separated by a positive distance in the $x_2$ direction. For such a configuration, a fundamental property of the De Giorgi perimeter (which follows from the properties of BV functions) is its additivity:\n$$\nP_M(E) = P_M\\left(\\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} E_k\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} P_M(E_k).\n$$\nWe compute the perimeter of a single component $E_k$. The perimeter $P_M(E_k)$ is, by definition for such a regular set, the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of its boundary, $\\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\\partial E_k)$.\nThe set $\\widetilde{E}_k = R_k \\times B = ([0,1] \\times [a_k, a_k+w_k]) \\times B$ is a product of a rectangle and a ball. Its boundary in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has several parts. When we map to the torus $M = \\mathbb{T}^n$, the faces of $\\widetilde{E}_k$ at $x_1=0$ and $x_1=1$ are identified. These faces are $(\\{0\\} \\times [a_k, a_k+w_k]) \\times B$ and $(\\{1\\} \\times [a_k, a_k+w_k]) \\times B$. Because they are identified, they do not belong to the boundary of $E_k$ in $M$.\nThe boundary $\\partial E_k$ in $M$ is composed of:\n1.  A \"top\" face $\\varphi(([0,1] \\times \\{a_k+w_k\\}) \\times B)$ and a \"bottom\" face $\\varphi(([0,1] \\times \\{a_k\\}) \\times B)$. Since $\\varphi$ is an isometry on $U$, the area of each face is the Euclidean area of its preimage, which is $\\mathcal{L}^1([0,1]) \\times \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) = \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B)$. The total contribution from these two faces is $2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B)$.\n2.  A \"side wall\" $\\varphi(([0,1] \\times [a_k, a_k+w_k]) \\times \\partial B)$. The $(n-1)$-dimensional measure of this product surface is the product of the measures of the component manifolds, as the ambient spaces $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$ are orthogonal. The area is $\\mathcal{L}^2([0,1] \\times [a_k, a_k+w_k]) \\times \\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B) = w_k \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B)$.\n\nThus, the perimeter of each component $E_k$ is:\n$$\nP_M(E_k) = 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) + w_k \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B).\n$$\nThe total perimeter of $E$ is the sum over all $k$:\n$$\nP_M(E) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} P_M(E_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) + w_k \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B) \\right).\n$$\nWe can split the sum:\n$$\nP_M(E) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) \\right) + \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} w_k \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B) \\right).\n$$\nThe second term is finite: $\\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B) \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} w_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{H}^{n-3}(\\partial B)$.\nHowever, the first term is a sum of a constant positive value:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) = 2 \\cdot \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 1.\n$$\nSince $\\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B)  0$ (as $r0$), this sum diverges to infinity. Therefore, $P_M(E) = \\infty$.\n\nThis construction provides an example of a set on the torus with finite volume but infinite perimeter, demonstrating that the isoperimetric inequality does not hold for arbitrary measurable sets.\n\n**4. Computation of the Riemannian Volume $\\mathrm{Vol}_{M}(E)$**\n\nAs derived in section 2, the exact value of the Riemannian volume of $E$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Vol}_{M}(E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathcal{L}^{n-2}(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^{(n-2)/2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} r^{n-2}.\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^{(n-2)/2} r^{n-2}}{2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "3031285"}]}
