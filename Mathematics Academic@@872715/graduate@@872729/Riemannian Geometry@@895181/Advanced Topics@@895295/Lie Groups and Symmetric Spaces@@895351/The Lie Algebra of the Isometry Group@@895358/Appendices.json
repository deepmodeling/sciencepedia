It is scientifically sound, objective, and contains all necessary information for its solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. We will address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Characterization of Killing Fields on Euclidean Space**\n\nWe are given that a smooth vector field $X$ on Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is a Killing field if its components $X_{j}$ in standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^{1}, \\dots, x^{n})$ satisfy the Killing equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{j} X_{i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\n$$\nHere, $\\partial_{i}$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^{i}$. The problem states that for the standard Euclidean metric, the Levi-Civita connection is given by $\\nabla = \\partial$, meaning all Christoffel symbols vanish in these coordinates. This implies that the partial derivatives commute, i.e., $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} = \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i}$.\n\nTo determine the functional form of the components $X_{j}$, we differentiate the Killing equation with respect to a third coordinate $x^{k}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{k}(\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{j} X_{i}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(1)} \\quad \\partial_{k}\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{k}\\partial_{j} X_{i} = 0\n$$\nSince this equation holds for all indices $i, j, k$, we can generate two other equations by cyclically permuting the indices:\n$$\n\\text{(2)} \\quad \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{(3)} \\quad \\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} + \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i} X_{k} = 0\n$$\nWe now manipulate these three equations. Let's compute $(2) + (3) - (1)$:\n$$\n(\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j}) + (\\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} + \\partial_{j}\\partial_{i} X_{k}) - (\\partial_{k}\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{k}\\partial_{j} X_{i}) = 0\n$$\nUsing the commutativity of partial derivatives, we can reorder the differential operators:\n$$\n\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j} + \\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} + \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} - \\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j} - \\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i} = 0\n$$\nThe terms $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{k} X_{j}$ and $\\partial_{j}\\partial_{k} X_{i}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n2 \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} = 0\n$$\nThis implies $\\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} X_{k} = 0$ for all $i, j, k$. This equation signifies that all second partial derivatives of any component of the vector field $X$ are zero. This means that each component $X_{k}$ must be an affine function of the coordinates, i.e., a polynomial of degree at most $1$. We can therefore write each component $X_{k}$ as:\n$$\nX_{k}(x) = a_{k} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} B_{kj} x^{j}\n$$\nwhere $a_{k}$ and $B_{kj}$ are constants for all $k, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nIn vector and matrix notation, if we let $X$ be the vector of components $(X_{1}, \\dots, X_{n})^{T}$, $a$ be the constant vector $(a_{1}, \\dots, a_{n})^{T}$, and $B$ be the constant matrix with entries $B_{kj}$, this relationship can be written as:\n$$\nX(x) = a + Bx\n$$\nThis establishes that every Killing field on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an affine vector field.\n\nNext, we must determine the algebraic condition on the matrix $B$. We substitute the derived affine form of $X$ back into the original Killing equation, $\\partial_{i} X_{j} + \\partial_{j} X_{i} = 0$. First, we compute the necessary derivatives:\n$$\n\\partial_{i} X_{j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( a_{j} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{jk} x^{k} \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{jk} \\frac{\\partial x^{k}}{\\partial x^{i}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{jk} \\delta_{i}^{k} = B_{ji}\n$$\nSimilarly, by swapping indices $i$ and $j$:\n$$\n\\partial_{j} X_{i} = B_{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Killing equation yields:\n$$\nB_{ji} + B_{ij} = 0\n$$\nor $B_{ji} = -B_{ij}$. In matrix form, this condition is $B^{T} = -B$. This means that the matrix $B$ must be a skew-symmetric (or anti-symmetric) matrix.\n\n**Part 2: Lie Algebra of Isometries and its Dimension**\n\nThe set of isometries of a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ forms a Lie group, denoted $\\mathrm{Isom}(M,g)$. The Lie algebra of this group, denoted $\\mathfrak{isom}(M,g)$, can be identified with the vector space of all smooth Killing vector fields on $M$.\n\nFor Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$, the isometry group is the Euclidean group $E(n)$. Its Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{e}(n)$ is thus the space of all Killing fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. From Part 1, we have concluded that this space consists of all affine vector fields of the form $X(x) = a + Bx$, where $a$ is an arbitrary constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $B$ is an arbitrary constant $n \\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nThis space of vector fields is a vector space, as it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Any such vector field is uniquely determined by the choice of a vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a skew-symmetric matrix $B \\in \\mathfrak{so}(n)$, where $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$ is the vector space of all $n \\times n$ real skew-symmetric matrices.\n\nThe dimension of this vector space is the number of independent parameters required to specify a field. This is the sum of the number of parameters for $a$ and the number of parameters for $B$.\nThe vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has $n$ components, so the dimension of the space of possible vectors $a$ is $n$. These vector fields, with $B=0$, correspond to infinitesimal translations.\nThe matrix $B$ is an $n \\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix. The condition $B_{ij} = -B_{ji}$ implies that the diagonal elements must be zero ($B_{ii} = -B_{ii} \\implies 2 B_{ii} = 0 \\implies B_{ii}=0$). The entries below the main diagonal are determined by the entries above it. Therefore, we only need to specify the entries $B_{ij}$ for $i  j$. The number of such entries is the number of ways to choose $2$ distinct indices from $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$.\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\nThese vector fields, with $a=0$, correspond to infinitesimal rotations about the origin.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie algebra of the isometry group of $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is the sum of the dimensions of the space of translations and the space of infinitesimal rotations:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{e}(n)) = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}^{n}) + \\dim(\\mathfrak{so}(n)) = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathfrak{e}(n)) = \\frac{2n}{2} + \\frac{n^{2} - n}{2} = \\frac{2n + n^{2} - n}{2} = \\frac{n^{2} + n}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n$$\nThis is the dimension of the Lie algebra of the isometry group of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3000251"}, {"introduction": "Having established the structure of isometries on a flat space, we now turn to the general case and investigate the local algebraic structure at a fixed point.

A full solution is now provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Task 1: Prove that $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\n\nTo show that $\\mathfrak{g}_{p} = \\{ X \\in \\mathfrak{g} \\mid X(p) = 0 \\}$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$, we must demonstrate two properties:\n1.  $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ is a vector subspace of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n2.  $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ is closed under the Lie bracket, i.e., for any $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, their Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is also in $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$.\n\nFor the first property, let $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ and let $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be scalars. By definition of $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, we have $X(p) = 0$ and $Y(p) = 0$. The vector field $aX + bY$ is also a complete Killing field. Evaluating it at $p$ gives:\n$$ (aX + bY)(p) = aX(p) + bY(p) = a(0) + b(0) = 0 $$\nThus, $aX + bY \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, which confirms that $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ is a vector subspace of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nFor the second property, let $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$. We need to show that $[X,Y](p) = 0$. Let us work in a local coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ around the point $p$. The vector fields $X$ and $Y$ can be written as $X = \\sum_{i} X^i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ and $Y = \\sum_{j} Y^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$. The condition $X(p) = 0$ means that all component functions $X^i$ vanish at $p$, i.e., $X^i(p) = 0$ for all $i$. Similarly, $Y^j(p) = 0$ for all $j$.\n\nThe Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is a vector field whose $k$-th component is given by:\n$$ [X,Y]^k = \\sum_{i} \\left( X^i \\frac{\\partial Y^k}{\\partial x^i} - Y^i \\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^i} \\right) $$\nTo find the value of this vector field at the point $p$, we evaluate its component functions at $p$:\n$$ [X,Y]^k(p) = \\sum_{i} \\left( X^i(p) \\left(\\frac{\\partial Y^k}{\\partial x^i}\\right)\\bigg|_{p} - Y^i(p) \\left(\\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^i}\\right)\\bigg|_{p} \\right) $$\nSince $X^i(p) = 0$ and $Y^i(p) = 0$ for all $i$, this expression simplifies to:\n$$ [X,Y]^k(p) = \\sum_{i} \\left( 0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial Y^k}{\\partial x^i}\\right)\\bigg|_{p} - 0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial X^k}{\\partial x^i}\\right)\\bigg|_{p} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis holds for all components $k = 1, \\dots, n$. Therefore, the vector $[X,Y](p)$ is the zero vector in $T_{p}M$. This shows that $[X,Y] \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$.\nSince $\\mathfrak{g}_{p}$ is a vector subspace closed under the Lie bracket, it is a Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Task 2: Show that $\\rho_{*}(X)$ is given by $A_{X} := (\\nabla X)_{p}$.**\n\nLet $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$. The map $\\rho_{*} : \\mathfrak{g}_{p} \\to \\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)$ is the derivative of the representation $\\rho : G_{p} \\to O(T_{p}M)$ at the identity. For any $v \\in T_{p}M$, $\\rho_{*}(X)(v)$ is defined by the action of the one-parameter subgroup generated by $X$. The one-parameter subgroup in $G_{p}$ corresponding to $X$ is the flow $\\Phi^{X}_{t}$ of $X$.\nThe action on $v$ is given by $\\rho(\\Phi^{X}_{t})(v) = d(\\Phi^{X}_{t})_p(v)$.\nThe derivative map $\\rho_{*}(X)$ is found by differentiating this action with respect to $t$ at $t=0$:\n$$ \\rho_{*}(X)(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\left( d(\\Phi^{X}_{t})_p(v) \\right) $$\nTo compute this derivative, we can relate it to the Lie derivative. For any vector field $Y$, the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}_{X}Y$ is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{X}Y = [X,Y] = \\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} (d\\Phi^{-X}_{t})(Y_{\\Phi^{X}_{t}})$. A more convenient definition for this context is that, for any smooth curve $\\gamma(s)$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$ and $\\gamma'(0)=v$,\n$$ \\rho_*(X)(v) = \\frac{\\mathcal{D}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} d(\\Phi_t^X)_p (v) $$\nHere, we interpret the derivative as a covariant derivative to handle the fact that $d(\\Phi_t^X)_p(v)$ is a vector in a fixed vector space $T_p M$. A more direct approach is to relate this to the covariant derivative. Let $v \\in T_p M$. We can view the calculation as:\n$$ \\rho_*(X)(v) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} d(\\Phi^{X}_{t})_p(v) = [X, \\tilde{v}](p) $$\nwhere $\\tilde{v}$ is any vector field defined in a neighborhood of $p$ such that $\\tilde{v}(p) = v$. Using the torsion-free property of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$, $[X, \\tilde{v}] = \\nabla_{X} \\tilde{v} - \\nabla_{\\tilde{v}} X$.\nEvaluating at $p$:\n$$ [X, \\tilde{v}](p) = (\\nabla_{X} \\tilde{v})_{p} - (\\nabla_{\\tilde{v}} X)_{p} $$\nThe term $(\\nabla_{X} \\tilde{v})_{p} = \\nabla_{X(p)} \\tilde{v}$. Since $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, we have $X(p) = 0$. Therefore, $\\nabla_{X(p)} \\tilde{v} = \\nabla_{0} \\tilde{v} = 0$.\nThe second term is $(\\nabla_{\\tilde{v}} X)_{p} = \\nabla_{\\tilde{v}(p)} X = \\nabla_{v} X$.\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$ \\rho_{*}(X)(v) = 0 - (\\nabla_{v} X)_{p} = -(\\nabla_{v} X)_{p} $$\nThere is a sign convention difference. Let's re-verify from first principles. Let $\\gamma(s)$ be a curve with $\\gamma(0)=p, \\gamma'(0)=v$.\n$\\rho_*(X)(v) = \\frac{D}{ds}\\vert_{s=0} \\frac{d}{dt}\\vert_{t=0} \\Phi_t^X(\\gamma(s)) = \\frac{D}{ds}\\vert_{s=0} X(\\gamma(s)) = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(0)} X = (\\nabla_v X)_p$. This is the standard definition and result. The Lie bracket definition of the differential is trickier.\nSo, $\\rho_{*}(X)$ is the endomorphism $A_{X} \\in \\operatorname{End}(T_{p}M)$ defined by $A_{X}(v) = (\\nabla_{v} X)_{p}$.\n\nNext, we must show that $A_{X} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)$. This requires showing that $A_X$ is a skew-symmetric operator with respect to the metric $g$ at $p$, denoted $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{p}$. For any $v, w \\in T_{p}M$, we must show $\\langle A_{X}v, w \\rangle_{p} + \\langle v, A_{X}w \\rangle_{p} = 0$.\nBy definition of $A_{X}$:\n$$ \\langle A_{X}v, w \\rangle_{p} + \\langle v, A_{X}w \\rangle_{p} = \\langle (\\nabla_{v} X)_{p}, w \\rangle_{p} + \\langle v, (\\nabla_{w} X)_{p} \\rangle_{p} $$\nSince $X$ is a Killing field, it satisfies the Killing equation $\\mathcal{L}_{X} g = 0$. In terms of the Levi-Civita connection, this is equivalent to:\n$$ g(\\nabla_{U} X, V) + g(U, \\nabla_{V} X) = 0 $$\nfor any vector fields $U$ and $V$. Let us evaluate this equation at the point $p$ with vector fields $\\tilde{v}$ and $\\tilde{w}$ such that $\\tilde{v}(p)=v$ and $\\tilde{w}(p)=w$.\n$$ g_{p}(\\nabla_{\\tilde{v}} X|_{p}, \\tilde{w}|_{p}) + g_{p}(\\tilde{v}|_{p}, \\nabla_{\\tilde{w}} X|_{p}) = 0 $$\nSince $\\nabla_U V$ is a tensor, its value at $p$ depends only on $U(p)$ and the field $V$. So, $(\\nabla_{\\tilde{v}} X)_{p} = (\\nabla_{v} X)_{p}$ and $(\\nabla_{\\tilde{w}} X)_{p} = (\\nabla_{w} X)_{p}$.\nThis gives:\n$$ \\langle (\\nabla_{v} X)_{p}, w \\rangle_{p} + \\langle v, (\\nabla_{w} X)_{p} \\rangle_{p} = 0 $$\nThis is exactly the condition for $A_X$ to be skew-symmetric. Thus, $A_{X} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)$.\n\n**Task 3: Compute the Lie bracket representation $\\rho_{*}([X,Y])$ in terms of $A$ and $B$.**\n\nWe are given the task to use the structural property that the derivative of a Lie group representation is a Lie algebra homomorphism.\nThe map $\\rho: G_{p} \\to O(T_{p}M)$ is a Lie group homomorphism (a representation). Its derivative at the identity, $\\rho_{*} : \\mathfrak{g}_{p} \\to \\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)$, is therefore a Lie algebra homomorphism.\nThe defining property of a Lie algebra homomorphism is that it preserves the Lie bracket structure. This means that for any two elements $X, Y \\in \\mathfrak{g}_{p}$, we have:\n$$ \\rho_{*}([X,Y]_{\\mathfrak{g}_{p}}) = [\\rho_{*}(X), \\rho_{*}(Y)]_{\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)} $$\nOn the left side, $[X,Y]_{\\mathfrak{g}_{p}}$ is the Lie bracket of the vector fields $X$ and $Y$.\nOn the right side, $[\\cdot, \\cdot]_{\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)}$ is the Lie bracket in the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)$. Since $\\mathfrak{so}(T_{p}M)$ is a Lie algebra of endomorphisms (i.e., matrices), its Lie bracket is given by the commutator of the endomorphisms.\nWe are given to denote $A = A_{X} = \\rho_{*}(X)$ and $B = A_{Y} = \\rho_{*}(Y)$.\nSubstituting these into the homomorphism property, we get:\n$$ \\rho_{*}([X,Y]) = [A, B] $$\nThe commutator $[A, B]$ of two endomorphisms $A$ and $B$ is defined as their composition in alternating order:\n$$ [A, B] = AB - BA $$\nTherefore, the analytic expression for $\\rho_{*}([X,Y])$ in terms of $A$ and $B$ is $AB - BA$. It is worth noting that this result holds precisely because we are considering the isotropy subalgebra where $X(p) = Y(p) = 0$. In a more general setting, a term involving the Riemann curvature tensor would appear, but it vanishes in this specific case because the curvature tensor $R(U,V)W$ is linear in its arguments $U$ and $V$.\nThe problem explicitly restricts the method to using only the homomorphism property, which leads directly to this conclusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{AB - BA}\n$$", "id": "3000239"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into one of the most profound consequences of the theory: the deep interplay between symmetry and curvature.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Weitzenböck Identity for 1-Forms\n\nWe begin by establishing the local coordinate expressions for the terms defining the Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta$ acting on a smooth $1$-form $\\alpha$. We adopt the sign convention where the Riemann curvature tensor is given by the commutator $[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_j]V^k = R^k_{lij}V^l$ for a vector field $V$, and for a $1$-form $\\alpha$, $[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_j]\\alpha_k = -R_{ijk}{}^l\\alpha_l$. The Ricci tensor is defined by $\\mathrm{Ric}_{ik} = R_{jik}{}^j$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be a smooth $1$-form with components $\\alpha_i$ in a local coordinate system.\n\nThe exterior derivative $d\\alpha$ is a $2$-form with components:\n$$\n(d\\alpha)_{ij} = \\partial_i \\alpha_j - \\partial_j \\alpha_i = \\nabla_i \\alpha_j - \\nabla_j \\alpha_i\n$$\nThe second equality holds because the Christoffel symbols are symmetric, i.e., $\\Gamma_{ij}^k = \\Gamma_{ji}^k$.\n\nThe formal adjoint $d^*$, also known as the codifferential, acts on a $k$-form to produce a $(k-1)$-form. Its action on a $p$-form $\\omega$ is given in coordinates by $(d^*\\omega)_{i_1...i_{p-1}} = -g^{jk}\\nabla_j \\omega_{k i_1...i_{p-1}}$.\nFor a $1$-form $\\alpha$, $d^*\\alpha$ is a $0$-form (a function) given by:\n$$\nd^*\\alpha = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\alpha_j = -\\nabla_i \\alpha^i\n$$\nFor a $2$-form $\\beta$, $d^*\\beta$ is a $1$-form with components:\n$$\n(d^*\\beta)_k = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\beta_{jk}\n$$\n\nNow we compute the two terms of the Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta\\alpha = d d^*\\alpha + d^* d\\alpha$.\n\nThe first term is $d d^*\\alpha$. Since $d^*\\alpha$ is a function, $d(d^*\\alpha)$ is a $1$-form whose components are the covariant derivatives of the function:\n$$\n(d d^*\\alpha)_k = \\nabla_k (d^*\\alpha) = \\nabla_k (-g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\alpha_j) = -g^{ij}\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j\n$$\nIn the last step, we used the fact that the Levi-Civita connection satisfies $\\nabla g = 0$, so $g^{ij}$ can be treated as a constant with respect to covariant differentiation.\n\nThe second term is $d^* d\\alpha$. Here, we apply $d^*$ to the $2$-form $d\\alpha$:\n$$\n(d^* d\\alpha)_k = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i (d\\alpha)_{jk} = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i (\\nabla_j \\alpha_k - \\nabla_k \\alpha_j)\n$$\nDistributing the derivative, we get:\n$$\n(d^* d\\alpha)_k = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\alpha_k + g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\alpha_j\n$$\nSumming the two terms to find the components of $\\Delta\\alpha$:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\alpha)_k = (d d^*\\alpha)_k + (d^* d\\alpha)_k = (-g^{ij}\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j) + (-g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\alpha_k + g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\alpha_j)\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\alpha)_k = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\alpha_k + g^{ij}(\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\alpha_j - \\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j)\n$$\nThe first term is precisely the definition of the rough Laplacian given in the problem statement:\n$$\n-g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\alpha_k = (\\nabla^*\\nabla\\alpha)_k\n$$\nThe second term contains the commutator of covariant derivatives:\n$$\ng^{ij}(\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\alpha_j - \\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j) = g^{ij}[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_k]\\alpha_j\n$$\nUsing the Ricci identity for $1$-forms, $[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_k]\\alpha_j = -R_{ikj}{}^l \\alpha_l$:\n$$\ng^{ij}[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_k]\\alpha_j = g^{ij}(-R_{ikj}{}^l \\alpha_l) = -g^{ij}R_{ikj}{}^l \\alpha_l\n$$\nBy the anti-symmetry of the Riemann tensor in its first two indices, $R_{ikj}{}^l = -R_{kij}{}^l$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n-g^{ij}(-R_{kij}{}^l \\alpha_l) = g^{ij}R_{kij}{}^l \\alpha_l\n$$\nThe contraction $g^{ij}R_{kij}{}^l$ is by definition the $(1,1)$ Ricci tensor, denoted $\\mathrm{Ric}_k{}^l$:\n$$\ng^{ij}R_{kij}{}^l = \\mathrm{Ric}_k{}^l\n$$\nThus, the curvature term becomes $\\mathrm{Ric}_k{}^l \\alpha_l$. This corresponds to the action of the Ricci endomorphism $\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}$ on $\\alpha$:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha))_k = \\mathrm{Ric}_k{}^l \\alpha_l\n$$\nAssembling the pieces, we have:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\alpha)_k = (\\nabla^*\\nabla\\alpha)_k + (\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha))_k\n$$\nThis holds for all components $k$, so we obtain the Weitzenböck identity on $1$-forms:\n$$\n\\Delta \\alpha = \\nabla^{\\ast} \\nabla \\alpha + \\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Application to a Killing Vector Field\n\nLet $X$ be a Killing vector field. The condition $\\mathcal{L}_X g = 0$ is equivalent to the Killing equation for the components of the metric dual $1$-form $\\alpha = X^\\flat$:\n$$\n\\nabla_i \\alpha_j + \\nabla_j \\alpha_i = 0\n$$\nThis equation states that the covariant derivative tensor $\\nabla\\alpha$ is skew-symmetric.\n\nWe use this property to compute the terms in the Weitzenböck identity for $\\alpha = X^\\flat$.\nFirst, consider the codifferential $d^*\\alpha$:\n$$\nd^*\\alpha = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\alpha_j\n$$\nFrom the Killing equation, $\\nabla_i \\alpha_j = -\\nabla_j \\alpha_i$. Substituting this:\n$$\nd^*\\alpha = -g^{ij}(-\\nabla_j \\alpha_i) = g^{ij}\\nabla_j \\alpha_i\n$$\nSince $g^{ij}$ is symmetric in its indices and we can relabel the dummy indices $i \\leftrightarrow j$, we have $g^{ij}\\nabla_j \\alpha_i = g^{ji}\\nabla_i \\alpha_j = g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\alpha_j$.\nSo, we have $d^*\\alpha = -d^*\\alpha$, which implies $2d^*\\alpha = 0$, and thus $d^*\\alpha=0$.\nA key property of a Killing field $X$ is that its dual $1$-form $X^\\flat$ is co-closed. This is equivalent to the statement that the vector field $X$ is divergence-free, $\\nabla_i X^i = 0$.\n\nNow, let us compute the rough Laplacian term, $\\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha$.\n$$\n(\\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha)_k = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_j \\alpha_k\n$$\nUsing the Killing equation $\\nabla_j \\alpha_k = -\\nabla_k \\alpha_j$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha)_k = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i(-\\nabla_k \\alpha_j) = g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\alpha_j\n$$\nWe can rewrite this using the commutator:\n$$\ng^{ij}\\nabla_i \\nabla_k \\alpha_j = g^{ij}(\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j + [\\nabla_i, \\nabla_k]\\alpha_j) = g^{ij}\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j + g^{ij}[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_k]\\alpha_j\n$$\nLet's analyze these two terms. For the first term, we can move $\\nabla_k$ outside the sum:\n$$\ng^{ij}\\nabla_k \\nabla_i \\alpha_j = \\nabla_k(g^{ij}\\nabla_i \\alpha_j) = \\nabla_k(-d^*\\alpha)\n$$\nSince we have shown that $d^*\\alpha=0$ for a Killing field, this term vanishes:\n$$\n\\nabla_k(-d^*\\alpha) = \\nabla_k(0) = 0\n$$\nThe second term is the curvature term we analyzed in Part 1:\n$$\ng^{ij}[\\nabla_i, \\nabla_k]\\alpha_j = (\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha))_k\n$$\nTherefore, for $\\alpha = X^\\flat$, we find that the rough Laplacian is equal to the Ricci operator term:\n$$\n\\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha = \\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result into the Weitzenböck identity $\\Delta \\alpha = \\nabla^*\\nabla \\alpha + \\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha)$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\alpha = \\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha) + \\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha) = 2\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(\\alpha)\n$$\nReplacing $\\alpha$ with $X^\\flat$, we arrive at the final expression for the Laplacian of a Killing $1$-form:\n$$\n\\Delta X^{\\flat} = 2\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(X^{\\flat})\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\mathrm{Ric}^{\\sharp}(X^{\\flat})}$$", "id": "3000229"}]}
