The analysis involves geodesic completeness, minimal path length, and the value of the infimum of lengths of all such paths.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is a well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically sound question within differential geometry. We proceed with the solution, addressing each part of the prompt in sequence.\n\n**Geodesic Incompleteness of $M$**\n\nA Riemannian manifold is defined as geodesically complete if every geodesic can be extended to be defined for all real numbers as its parameter. To demonstrate that $M$ is geodesically incomplete, we must produce a geodesic in $M$ that cannot be extended for all time.\n\nThe metric on $M$ is the restriction of the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$, the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection are all identically zero. The geodesic equation, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$, thus simplifies to the ordinary differential equation $\\ddot{\\gamma}(t)=0$. The solutions are of the form $\\gamma(t) = at+b$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ are constant vectors. These correspond to straight lines parameterized at a constant speed. For a unit-speed geodesic, we require the norm of the velocity vector to be one, i.e., $\\|a\\|_{g} = 1$.\n\nConsider a geodesic that originates in $M$ and is directed toward the puncture at $(0,0)$. Let's choose the starting point at $t=0$ to be $(1,0) \\in M$ and the velocity vector to be $(-1,0)$, which has a unit norm. The equation for this unit-speed geodesic is:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = (1,0) + t(-1,0) = (1-t, 0)\n$$\nThis curve describes a straight line in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For this curve to be a geodesic *in $M$*, its image must be contained in $M$ for its domain of definition. The curve $\\gamma(t)$ lies in $M$ if and only if $\\gamma(t) \\neq (0,0)$. The condition $\\gamma(t)=(0,0)$ implies $(1-t, 0)=(0,0)$, which occurs precisely at $t=1$.\nConsequently, the geodesic $\\gamma(t)=(1-t,0)$ is well-defined as a curve in $M$ for $t \\in (-\\infty, 1)$. However, at the parameter value $t=1$, the curve reaches the point $(0,0)$, which has been excluded from the manifold $M$. Therefore, this geodesic cannot be extended to $t=1$ or any later time while remaining within $M$. The maximal interval of existence for this geodesic starting at $t=0$ is a proper subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. This demonstrates that the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete.\n\n**Lower Bound for Path Length**\n\nLet $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to M$ be an arbitrary piecewise smooth curve in the class $\\mathcal{C}$, which means $\\gamma(0)=p=(-1,0)$ and $\\gamma(1)=q=(1,0)$. The Riemannian length of $\\gamma$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_g$ is the standard Euclidean norm induced by the inner product $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$.\n\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus for vector-valued functions, the total displacement vector is the integral of the velocity vector:\n$$\nq - p = \\gamma(1) - \\gamma(0) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe take the norm of both sides of this equation:\n$$\n\\|q - p\\|_{g} = \\left\\| \\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right\\|_{g}\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the straight-line distance in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ between $p$ and $q$:\n$$\n\\|q - p\\|_{g} = \\|(1,0) - (-1,0)\\|_{g} = \\|(2,0)\\|_{g} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = 2\n$$\nFor the right-hand side, we apply the integral form of the triangle inequality (also known as the Minkowski integral inequality), which is a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality: for any integrable vector-valued function $v(t)$, it holds that $\\|\\int v(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\| \\le \\int \\|v(t)\\| \\, \\mathrm{d}t$. Applying this inequality with $v(t)=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\left\\| \\int_{0}^{1} \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right\\|_{g} \\le \\int_{0}^{1} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = L(\\gamma)\n$$\nCombining these results yields the inequality:\n$$\n2 = \\|q-p\\|_{g} \\le L(\\gamma)\n$$\nThis proves that any admissible path $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}$ has a length of at least $2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the condition for equality, $L(\\gamma) = 2$. Equality in the integral triangle inequality holds if and only if the vector function $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ has a constant direction for almost every $t \\in [0,1]$. This implies there exists a constant unit vector $u$ and a non-negative scalar function $f(t) = \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_g$ such that $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = f(t)u$ for almost all $t$.\nSubstituting this into the displacement integral gives:\n$$\nq-p = \\int_{0}^{1} f(t)u \\, \\mathrm{d}t = u \\left(\\int_{0}^{1} f(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the direction of $u$ must be the same as the direction of $q-p = (2,0)$. Therefore, the unit vector must be $u=(1,0)$.\nThe trajectory of the curve can be recovered by integrating the velocity:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\gamma(0) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{\\gamma}(s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s = p + \\int_{0}^{t} f(s)u \\, \\mathrm{d}s = (-1,0) + \\left(\\int_{0}^{t} f(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right)(1,0)\n$$\nLet $s(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s$. The function $s(t)$ is continuous, non-decreasing, and gives the arc length of the curve from parameter $0$ to $t$. The position is $\\gamma(t) = (-1+s(t), 0)$.\nThe total length is $L(\\gamma) = \\int_0^1 f(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = s(1)$. The equality condition $L(\\gamma)=2$ requires $s(1)=2$. We also have $s(0)=0$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist some $t_0 \\in (0,1)$ such that $s(t_0)=1$.\nAt this parameter value $t_0$, the curve's position is:\n$$\n\\gamma(t_0) = (-1+s(t_0), 0) = (-1+1, 0) = (0,0)\n$$\nThis means that any path whose length is exactly $2$ must pass through the origin $(0,0)$. However, by definition, any curve $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}$ must have its image entirely within $M = \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. Therefore, no curve in $\\mathcal{C}$ can achieve the length $2$. We must have the strict inequality $L(\\gamma) > 2$ for all $\\gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}$.\n\n**One-Parameter Family of Admissible Curves**\n\nWe now construct a family of admissible curves $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ that bypass the origin and whose lengths can be made arbitrarily close to the lower bound of $2$. For any $\\varepsilon$ such that $0  \\varepsilon  1$, consider the piecewise smooth curve $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ composed of three segments:\n1.  $\\gamma_1$: The straight line segment from $p=(-1,0)$ to the point $p_\\varepsilon=(-\\varepsilon,0)$.\n2.  $\\gamma_2$: The upper semicircle of radius $\\varepsilon$ centered at the origin, connecting $p_\\varepsilon=(-\\varepsilon,0)$ to $q_\\varepsilon=(\\varepsilon,0)$.\n3.  $\\gamma_3$: The straight line segment from $q_\\varepsilon=(\\varepsilon,0)$ to $q=(1,0)$.\n\nFor any $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$, this curve $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ is in $\\mathcal{C}$. We calculate the length of each segment:\n-   The length of $\\gamma_1$ is the Euclidean distance between $(-1,0)$ and $(-\\varepsilon,0)$, which is $L(\\gamma_1) = \\sqrt{(-1-(-\\varepsilon))^2} = 1-\\varepsilon$.\n-   The length of the semicircle $\\gamma_2$ is half the circumference of a circle with radius $\\varepsilon$, which is $L(\\gamma_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi\\varepsilon) = \\pi\\varepsilon$.\n-   The length of $\\gamma_3$ is the Euclidean distance between $(\\varepsilon,0)$ and $(1,0)$, which is $L(\\gamma_3) = \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^2} = 1-\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe total length of $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ is the sum of these lengths:\n$$\nL(\\gamma_\\varepsilon) = L(\\gamma_1) + L(\\gamma_2) + L(\\gamma_3) = (1-\\varepsilon) + \\pi\\varepsilon + (1-\\varepsilon) = 2 + (\\pi - 2)\\varepsilon\n$$\nWe can now examine the limit of these lengths as the bypass scale $\\varepsilon$ approaches zero:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0^+} L(\\gamma_\\varepsilon) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0^+} \\left(2 + (\\pi - 2)\\varepsilon\\right) = 2\n$$\nThis demonstrates that we can find curves in $\\mathcal{C}$ whose lengths are arbitrarily close to $2$.\n\n**The Infimum Value**\n\nThe infimum of a set of real numbers is its greatest lower bound. Let $S = \\{L(\\gamma) : \\gamma \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$ be the set of lengths of all admissible curves connecting $p$ and $q$. We are asked to find $L_{\\ast} = \\inf S$.\n\nFrom our analysis on the lower bound for path length, we established that for any $\\gamma\\in\\mathcal{C}$, $L(\\gamma) \\ge 2$. This implies that $2$ is a lower bound for the set $S$. The definition of the infimum requires it to be greater than or equal to any lower bound, so:\n$$\nL_{\\ast} = \\inf S \\ge 2\n$$\nFrom our construction of a one-parameter family of curves, we showed that $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^+} L(\\gamma_\\varepsilon) = 2$. This means that for any $\\delta > 0$, there exists a curve in $\\mathcal{C}$ (namely, $\\gamma_\\varepsilon$ for a sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$) whose length is less than $2+\\delta$. According to the definition of an infimum, if for every $\\delta>0$ there is an element of the set less than $2+\\delta$, the infimum must be less than or equal to $2$:\n$$\nL_{\\ast} = \\inf S \\le 2\n$$\nCombining the two inequalities $L_{\\ast} \\ge 2$ and $L_{\\ast} \\le 2$, we are forced to conclude that\n$$\nL_{\\ast} = 2\n$$\nThis result illustrates a key consequence of geodesic incompleteness as described by the Hopf-Rinow theorem. The Riemannian distance $d_M(p,q)$ is defined as the infimum of path lengths, so $d_M(p,q)=2$. However, because the space is not complete, there is no guarantee that this infimum is achieved by any curve, i.e., there is no length-minimizing geodesic in $M$ connecting $p$ and $q$. Indeed, we have shown that the infimum is not attained.\n\nThe exact value of the infimum is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3028612"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the consequences of incompleteness, we now turn to the archetypal example of a complete, compact manifold: the sphere.

No rounding is required, and no physical units are to be used in the final expression.", "solution": "We start from the core definitions. The Riemannian distance $d(x,y)$ between two points $x,y$ in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths, with respect to $g$, of all piecewise smooth curves joining $x$ to $y$. A geodesic is a curve $\\gamma$ satisfying the geodesic equation with respect to the Levi-Civita connection, and locally it extremizes (and in particular, for sufficiently short segments, minimizes) the length functional. A compact Riemannian manifold is complete as a metric space, and by the Hopf–Rinow theorem, in a complete, connected Riemannian manifold any two points can be joined by a minimizing geodesic.\n\nOn the round sphere $S^{2}_{R}$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, geodesics are exactly the great circles, i.e., intersections of $S^{2}_{R}$ with two-dimensional linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ passing through the origin. This classical fact can be justified intrinsically by observing that the geodesic curvature of a great circle is zero, and extrinsically by noting that a great circle is a circle of radius $R$ lying in a plane through the origin and has acceleration purely normal to the sphere, with vanishing tangential component under the Levi-Civita connection; hence it satisfies the geodesic equation.\n\nFix $p \\in S^{2}_{R}$. Any plane through the origin containing $p$ also contains $-p$ and intersects $S^{2}_{R}$ in a great circle. On that great circle, parameterize the arc from $p$ to $-p$ by the central angle $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$ at the center $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Along a great circle of radius $R$, the arclength element is $R \\, d\\theta$ because the circle is a Euclidean circle of radius $R$ sitting in a plane, and the length of an arc subtending angle $\\theta$ is $R \\theta$ when angles are measured in radians. Therefore, the length of the geodesic arc from $p$ to $-p$ along any great circle is\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} R \\, d\\theta = R \\pi.\n$$\nThis shows that $d(p,-p) \\leq R \\pi$. To see that this is in fact the exact distance, we note that any curve on the sphere connecting $p$ to $-p$ must, when projected radially onto the plane containing any chosen great circle through $p$ and $-p$, have length at least that of the corresponding circular arc, and the minimizing curves are segments of great circles. More intrinsically, by the completeness of $S^{2}_{R}$ and Hopf–Rinow, there exists a minimizing geodesic between $p$ and $-p$; every geodesic joining these points lies on a great circle and necessarily subtends central angle $\\pi$, so its length is $R \\pi$. Thus the infimum is achieved and equals $R \\pi$, hence\n$$\nd(p,-p) = R \\pi.\n$$\n\nNext, we explain the existence of multiple distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$ and relate it to the cut locus. The cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p$ in a Riemannian manifold is, informally, the set of endpoints of maximal distance-minimizing geodesic segments emanating from $p$, equivalently the closure of points where different minimizing geodesics from $p$ coalesce or where the exponential map ceases to be injective. On $S^{2}_{R}$, the cut locus of $p$ is the singleton $\\{-p\\}$. Indeed, for any $q \\in S^{2}_{R}$ with $q \\neq -p$, there is a unique great circle determined by the plane spanned by $p$ and $q$, and among the two arcs from $p$ to $q$ on this great circle, the shorter one has central angle strictly less than $\\pi$ and is the unique minimizing geodesic. At $q = -p$, however, every plane through the origin containing $p$ yields a great circle containing $-p$, and along each such great circle there are two antipodal half-circles from $p$ to $-p$ of length $R \\pi$. The set of such planes is parametrized by the unit vectors in the tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$; hence there is a continuum of distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$. Moreover, beyond $-p$ along any such geodesic, the curve ceases to minimize distance, reflecting that the injectivity radius at $p$ is $R \\pi$ and that $\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact Riemannian distance between antipodal points on the round sphere of radius $R$ is $R \\pi$, angles understood in radians, and the multiplicity of minimizing geodesics at the antipode is precisely the manifestation of the cut locus being the antipodal point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi R}$$", "id": "2998901"}, {"introduction": "A common point of confusion is equating the concept of completeness with compactness.

A Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if every geodesic can be extended for all values of its parameter $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. Consider a unit-speed geodesic moving along a vertical line towards the boundary $y=0$. For a unit-speed parameterization $t$, the arc-length is simply the elapsed parameter time. The arc-length from any point $(x_0, y_0)$ with $y_0>0$ to a point $(x_0, \\epsilon)$ with $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ is $L = |\\ln(\\epsilon/y_0)| = \\ln(y_0/\\epsilon)$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, $L \\to \\infty$. This implies that the boundary $\\{y=0\\}$ is infinitely far away from any point in the manifold. A geodesic, parameterized by arc-length, would require an infinite amount of time to reach this boundary. Therefore, no geodesic can leave the manifold in finite time. Every geodesic is defined for all $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$, and the manifold is geodesically complete.\n\nThe Hopf-Rinow theorem provides several equivalent characterizations of completeness for a Riemannian manifold. One of the equivalences states that a manifold $(M, g)$ is geodesically complete if and only if the associated metric space $(M, d)$ is complete, where $d$ is the distance function induced by the metric $g$. Our finding that the distance to the boundary is infinite implies that any Cauchy sequence of points in $(M, d)$ must have a limit point within $M$ (i.e., its $y$-coordinate is bounded away from zero), meaning $(M, d)$ is a complete metric space. Thus, by the Hopf-Rinow theorem, $(M, g)$ is geodesically complete, which is consistent with our direct analysis of the geodesic paths.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left| \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{y_{0}}\\right) \\right|}\n$$", "id": "3028591"}]}
