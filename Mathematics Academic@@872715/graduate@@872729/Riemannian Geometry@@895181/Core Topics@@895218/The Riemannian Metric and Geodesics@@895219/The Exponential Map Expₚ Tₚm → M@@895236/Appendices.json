Thus, the zeroth-order term is:\n$$g_{ij}(0) = \\delta_{ij}$$\n\n**Step 2: First-Order Term, $\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k}(0)$**\nIn geodesic normal coordinates, the radial lines through the origin are geodesics parametrized by arc length (up to a constant factor). A line $x^i(t) = c^i t$, where $c^i$ are constants, corresponds to the geodesic $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(t \\sum_i c^i e_i)$. The geodesic equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^k_{ij}(x(t)) \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$$\nFor $x^i(t) = c^i t$, we have $\\frac{dx^i}{dt} = c^i$ and $\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0$. Substituting these into the geodesic equation gives:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij}(c^1t, \\dots, c^nt) c^i c^j = 0$$\nThis holds for any choice of constants $c^i$ and for $t$ in a neighborhood of $0$. Setting $t=0$, we get:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij}(0) c^i c^j = 0$$\nSince this must hold for all vectors $(c^1, \\dots, c^n)$, the symmetric part of the tensor $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(0)$ must be zero.

On $S^n$, for any point $q \\in S^n$ that is not the antipodal point of $p$ (i.e., $q \\neq -p$), there is a unique shortest geodesic connecting $p$ to $q$. However, for the antipodal point $q=-p$, there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$, namely all the semicircles of great circles passing through $p$ and $-p$. The length of each of these geodesics is $\\pi$. Thus, the cut locus of $p$ is precisely the singleton set containing the antipodal point: $\\text{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\n\nThe injectivity radius at $p$ is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, \\text{Cut}(p)) = d(p, -p) $$\nAs established, the distance on the unit sphere between a point and its antipode is the length of a minimal geodesic path, which is $\\pi$.\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\pi $$\nThis value is the same as the distance to the first conjugate point, as expected for a symmetric space like the sphere.
