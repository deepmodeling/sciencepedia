Each $\\gamma_s$ is a curve parameterized by the longitude $\\varphi=t$ at a constant colatitude $\\theta=\\theta(s)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the length $L(s)$ of the curve $\\gamma_s$. The length functional is given by $L(\\gamma_s) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\sqrt{g_{\\gamma_s(t)}\\!\\left(\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t),\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t)\\right)}\\,dt$.\n\nTo evaluate the integrand, we first find the tangent vector to the curve $\\gamma_s$. In the given coordinates, the curve is $(\\theta, \\varphi) = (\\theta(s), t)$. The tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t)$ is found by differentiating with respect to the parameter $t$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\theta(s), \\frac{d}{dt}t\\right) = \\left(0, 1\\right)\n$$\nIn the tangent space basis $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi}\\right\\}$, this corresponds to the vector $\\dot{\\gamma}_s(t) = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi}$.\n\nNext, we compute the squared norm of this tangent vector using the metric $g$.

A curve is a geodesic if and only if it is a critical point of the length functional for all smooth variations fixing the endpoints. For a family of closed curves, this principle means that a curve $\\gamma_0$ is a closed geodesic if the first variation of its length is zero for any smooth variation $\\gamma_s$ through closed curves.\n\nIn our case, the variation is determined by the choice of the smooth function $\\theta(s)$. The term $\\theta'(0)$ characterizes the infinitesimal change of the variation away from the initial curve $\\gamma_0$. For $\\gamma_0$ to be a critical point of the length functional, its first variation must be zero for *any* choice of variation, which means for any choice of a smooth function $\\theta(s)$. This implies the first variation must be zero for any possible value of $\\theta'(0)$.\n\nIf we choose a non-trivial variation, for instance one where $\\theta'(0) \\neq 0$, the condition\n$$\n2\\pi\\theta'(0)\\cos(\\theta_0) = 0\n$$\nmust hold. Since this must be true for any $\\theta'(0)$, including non-zero values, the other factor must be zero:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta_0) = 0\n$$\nThe domain for the colatitude is $\\theta_0 \\in (0,\\pi)$. The only value in this interval for which $\\cos(\\theta_0)=0$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nThe latitude circle corresponding to $\\theta_0 = \\pi/2$ is the equator. For any other latitude circle, where $\\theta_0 \\neq \\pi/2$, we have $\\cos(\\theta_0) \\neq 0$. For such a circle, we can always choose a variation (e.g., with $\\theta'(0)=1$) for which the first variation of length is non-zero. Therefore, these latitude circles are not critical points of the length functional and hence are not geodesics. This calculation demonstrates that the equator is the only latitude circle that satisfies a necessary condition to be a geodesic.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the explicit closed-form expression for $\\left.\\dfrac{d}{ds}\\right|_{s=0}L(s)$ under the assumption that the variation is normalized by $\\theta'(0)=1$. Substituting $\\theta'(0)=1$ into our general expression for the first variation gives:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{ds}\\right|_{s=0}L(s) = 2\\pi(1)\\cos(\\theta_0) = 2\\pi\\cos(\\theta_0)\n$$\nThis expression represents the rate of change of the circumference of a latitude circle as it is moved \"down\" (towards the south pole) along the sphere with unit \"speed\" in the $\\theta$ direction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi\\cos(\\theta_{0})}\n$$", "id": "2976661"}, {"introduction": "While the length functional is intuitive, the energy functional, $E(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})\\,dt$, is often more convenient analytically due to the absence of a square root.

Since $e_2(t)$ is parallel transported, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}e_2(t)=0$, so $J'(t) = y'(t)e_2(t)$.\n$J''(t) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J'(t) = y''(t)e_2(t) + y'(t)\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}e_2(t) = y''(t)e_2(t)$.\nSubstituting this into the Jacobi equation yields:\n$$\ny''(t)e_2(t) + \\frac{1}{R^{2}} y(t)e_2(t) = 0\n$$\nThis reduces to the scalar ordinary differential equation for the coefficient $y(t)$:\n$$\ny''(t) + \\frac{1}{R^{2}} y(t) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution for this equation is $y(t) = A\\cos(t/R) + B\\sin(t/R)$ for some constants $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nWe are given the initial conditions $J(0) = 0$ and $J'(0) \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $J(0)=0$ implies $y(0)=0$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$y(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$.\nSo the solution must be of the form $y(t) = B\\sin(t/R)$.\nThe derivative is $y'(t) = \\frac{B}{R}\\cos(t/R)$. The condition $J'(0) \\neq 0$ implies $y'(0) \\neq 0$, which means $\\frac{B}{R} \\neq 0$, so $B \\neq 0$.\nA conjugate point to $p=\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ occurs at time $t>0$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t)=0$. We must find the first positive time $t_{\\mathrm{conj}}$ for which $J(t_{\\mathrm{conj}})=0$.\n$J(t)=y(t)e_2(t)=0$ if and only if $y(t)=0$. Since $B \\neq 0$, we require $\\sin(t/R)=0$.\nThe solutions for $t>0$ are given by $t/R = n\\pi$ for integers $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe first positive time is for $n=1$, which gives $t = \\pi R$.\nThus, the first conjugate time to $p$ along any unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma_v$ is $t_{\\mathrm{conj}} = \\pi R$.\n\nSecond, we use this result to analyze the properties of geodesic segments.\nA fundamental result from the theory of variations (specifically, the Morse-Schoenberg theorem) states that a geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is the unique length-minimizing curve between its endpoints if and only if there are no points conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along $\\gamma$ in the interval $(0,t)$.\nFrom our calculation, conjugate points to $p$ along any geodesic occur at distances (or times for a unit-speed geodesic) $n\\pi R$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots\\}$. The first conjugate point appears at distance $\\pi R$.\nTherefore, for any $t \\in (0, t_{\\mathrm{conj}})=(0, \\pi R)$, the geodesic segment $\\gamma_v|_{[0,t]}$ from $p$ to $\\exp_{p}(tv)$ is the unique shortest path between these two points.\nAnother key result states that the exponential map $\\exp_{p}: T_{p}M \\to M$ is a local diffeomorphism, and it fails to be a diffeomorphism precisely at vectors $u \\in T_{p}M$ for which $\\exp_{p}(u)$ is a conjugate point to $p$.\nSince the first conjugate points occur at a distance of $\\pi R$ from $p$ in any direction, the exponential map $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism when restricted to the open ball $B_{\\pi R}(0)$ in the tangent space $T_{p}S^{2}_{R}$. The image $\\exp_{p}(B_{\\pi R}(0))$ is the entire sphere minus the single point antipodal to $p$.\nAt $t = t_{\\mathrm{conj}} = \\pi R$, the geodesic segment $\\gamma_v|_{[0,\\pi R]}$ reaches the first conjugate point. At this point, the geodesic is no longer guaranteed to be a *unique* minimizer. The existence of a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ with $J(0)=J(\\pi R)=0$ implies there is a one-parameter family of curves from $p$ to $\\gamma_v(\\pi R)$ with lengths close to the geodesic length, indicating that the geodesic fails to be a strict local minimizer. On the sphere, all geodesics starting from $p$ converge at the antipodal point after a distance of $\\pi R$.\n\nThird, we determine the cut locus $C(p)$ and the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$.\nThe cut locus $C(p)$ is the set of points $q$ for which the geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$ is minimizing but ceases to be so if extended any further. This corresponds to either $q$ being the first conjugate point to $p$ along a minimizing geodesic, or there being at least two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$.\nOn the sphere $S^2_R$, due to its symmetry, the situation is simple. For any initial direction $v \\in T_pS^2_R$, the geodesic $\\gamma_v(t)$ travels along a great circle. All great circles passing through $p$ intersect again at a single common point: the antipodal point to $p$, let's denote it $-p$. The distance along any of these great circles from $p$ to $-p$ is $\\pi R$.\nThis common point of intersection, $-p$, is the first conjugate point to $p$ along any geodesic starting from $p$.\nTherefore, the cut locus of $p$ consists of this single point: $C(p) = \\{-p\\}$.\nAt this antipodal point, there are infinitely many distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$, corresponding to all the great semicircle paths.\n\nThe injectivity radius at $p$, $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is defined as the distance from $p$ to its cut locus, which is the supremal radius $r$ such that $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism on the open ball $B_r(0) \\subset T_pS^2_R$.\nAs established, this radius corresponds to the distance to the first conjugate point.\n$$\n\\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, C(p)) = d(p, -p)\n$$\nThe distance between a point and its antipode on a sphere of radius $R$ is half the circumference of a great circle. The circumference is $2\\pi R$, so the distance is $\\pi R$. This is consistent with our finding that $t_{\\mathrm{conj}} = \\pi R$ for a unit-speed geodesic.\nTherefore, the injectivity radius of any point $p$ on the sphere $S^2_R$ is $\\pi R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi R}$$", "id": "2976646"}]}
