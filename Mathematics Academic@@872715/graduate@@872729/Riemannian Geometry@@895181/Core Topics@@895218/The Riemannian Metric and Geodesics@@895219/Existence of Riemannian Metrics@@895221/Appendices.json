Cover $M$ by coordinate charts $\\{(U_{i}, \\varphi_{i})\\}_{i \\in I}$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. On each $U_{i}$, use the standard Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and pull it back to $U_{i}$ to obtain a smooth, symmetric, positive-definite $(0,2)$-tensor $g_{i} = \\varphi_{i}^{*}\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. Choose a locally finite partition of unity $\\{\\psi_{i}\\}_{i \\in I}$ subordinate to $\\{U_{i}\\}$.

Each $g_{i}$ is symmetric, and linear combinations with scalar coefficients preserve symmetry. For positive-definiteness, fix $p \\in M$ and $v \\in T_{p}M \\setminus \\{0\\}$. For every $i$ with $\\psi_{i}(p) > 0$, one has $g_{i,p}(v,v) > 0$. Since $\\psi_{i}(p) \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{i} \\psi_{i}(p) = 1$, it follows that\n$$\ng_{p}(v,v) = \\sum_{i \\in I} \\psi_{i}(p) \\, g_{i,p}(v,v) > 0,\n$$\nbecause it is a convex combination of strictly positive numbers. Thus $g$ is a Riemannian metric. This construction uses only partitions of unity and local inner products; no curvature constraints are invoked at any step. Therefore, the existence of a Riemannian metric is independent of curvature requirements.\n\nHow curvature enters only after a metric choice. The Riemann curvature tensor in Riemannian geometry is defined via the Levi-Civita connection associated to a chosen metric. Given a Riemannian metric $g$, there exists a unique affine connection $\\nabla$ on $TM$ that is torsion-free and satisfies $\\nabla g = 0$. This is the Levi-Civita connection, determined by $g$. The curvature tensor $R^{g}$ is then defined, for vector fields $X, Y, Z$, by\n$$\nR^{g}(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z,\n$$\nwhich depends on $\\nabla$, hence on $g$. Different choices of $g$ yield different Levi-Civita connections and potentially different curvature tensors. Absent a choice of metric (or another canonical connection), a smooth manifold does not carry a canonical notion of Riemannian curvature. While one can choose arbitrary affine connections $\\nabla$ on $TM$ without a metric and form their curvature tensors $R^{\\nabla}$, such choices are not canonical; Riemannian curvature refers to the curvature of the Levi-Civita connection of a particular metric.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This asserts exactly the standard partition-of-unity construction of a Riemannian metric on a smooth, paracompact manifold and explicitly notes that curvature conditions play no role in the construction. The argument above establishes this directly. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This claims equivalence between the existence of a Riemannian metric and the existence of a torsion-free flat connection (curvature zero). The existence of a Riemannian metric does not imply flatness; many Riemannian manifolds have nonzero curvature. Conversely, the existence of a flat torsion-free affine connection does not characterize the existence of a Riemannian metric, and in any case, smooth manifolds admit affine connections regardless of metric, and flatness is a strong additional condition unrelated to the metric’s existence. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This states that in Riemannian geometry, the curvature tensor is defined only after choosing a metric via the unique torsion-free, metric-compatible connection, and that it depends on $g$. As explained, $R^{g}$ arises from the Levi-Civita connection associated to $g$, so it depends on $g$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. This claims a canonical notion of Riemann curvature on any smooth manifold without any structure. There is no canonical connection or metric on a general smooth manifold, so there is no canonical Riemannian curvature. Any curvature tensor requires a choice (of connection), and in Riemannian geometry, the canonical choice is the Levi-Civita connection determined by a chosen metric. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This is a linear-algebraic fact used in the gluing construction: convex combinations of symmetric positive-definite bilinear forms are symmetric positive-definite. Symmetry is preserved by linear combination, and for any nonzero $v$, each $b_{i}(v,v) > 0$; with $\\lambda_{i} \\geq 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_{i} = 1$, one has $b(v,v) = \\sum \\lambda_{i} b_{i}(v,v) > 0$.

The provided values $\\phi_{1}(0,0) = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\phi_{2}(0,0) = \\frac{2}{5}$ are consistent with the function definitions, as $\\rho(x)$ is an even function, which implies $\\int_{-1/2}^{0} \\rho(t) dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \\rho(t) dt$, leading to $\\sigma(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Also, $\\rho_{0}(0) = 1$. Thus, $\\phi_{1}(0,0) = \\sigma(0) + \\frac{1}{10}\\rho_{0}(0) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$. The property $\\phi_{1}+\\phi_{2}=1$ is explicitly defined. The support conditions for the partition of unity are also readily verifiable from the definitions. The problem is self-contained, mathematically sound, well-posed, and objective. It poses a clear question that can be answered through direct computation based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we construct the local expressions for the metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$. The pullback of the Euclidean metric $\\delta$ by a linear map represented by a matrix $A$ has a component matrix given by $A^T A$. Here, the ambient coordinates on $M$ are $(x,y)$, and the standard basis for the tangent space at any point is $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\}$.\n\nFor $g_1 = \\varphi_1^* \\delta$ on $U_1$, the map is $\\varphi_1(u) = A_1 u$ with $A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix representation of $g_1$ in the $(x,y)$ coordinate system, which we denote by $G_1$, is constant on $U_1$:\n$$\nG_1 = A_1^T A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe local expression is $g_1 = 4(dx \\otimes dx) + 1(dy \\otimes dy)$.\n\nFor $g_2 = \\varphi_2^* \\delta$ on $U_2$, the map is $\\varphi_2(u) = A_2 u$ with $A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix representation of $g_2$, denoted by $G_2$, is constant on $U_2$:\n$$\nG_2 = A_2^T A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}^T \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe local expression is $g_2 = 1(dx \\otimes dx) + 1(dx \\otimes dy) + 1(dy \\otimes dx) + 5(dy \\otimes dy)$.\n\nNext, we verify that $g = \\phi_1 g_1 + \\phi_2 g_2$ defines a symmetric positive-definite tensor field on the overlap region $U_1 \\cap U_2 = \\{(x,y) \\in M : -\\frac{1}{2} < x < \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. The matrix representation of $g$ at a point $q \\in U_1 \\cap U_2$ is $G(q) = \\phi_1(q) G_1 + \\phi_2(q) G_2$.\n- **Symmetry**: The matrices $G_1$ and $G_2$ are symmetric, as they are of the form $A^T A$. Since $\\phi_1(q)$ and $\\phi_2(q)$ are scalars, the linear combination $G(q)$ is also a symmetric matrix. Thus, $g$ is a symmetric tensor field.\n- **Positive-Definiteness**: A metric is positive-definite if for any non-zero tangent vector $v$, $g(v,v) > 0$. In matrix form, this means $v^T G(q) v > 0$ for all non-zero vectors $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\nThe matrices $G_1$ and $G_2$ are positive-definite because their corresponding linear maps $A_1$ and $A_2$ are invertible ($\\det(A_1) = 2 \\neq 0$, $\\det(A_2) = 2 \\neq 0$). Thus, for any $v \\neq 0$, $v^T G_1 v > 0$ and $v^T G_2 v > 0$.\nThe expression for $v^T G(q) v$ is:\n$$\nv^T G(q) v = v^T(\\phi_1(q) G_1 + \\phi_2(q) G_2)v = \\phi_1(q) (v^T G_1 v) + \\phi_2(q) (v^T G_2 v).\n$$\nThis is a convex combination. We must show that the coefficients $\\phi_1(q)$ and $\\phi_2(q)$ are strictly positive for any $q = (x,y)$ in the open set $U_1 \\cap U_2$.\nFor $x \\in (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, $\\rho(x) = \\exp(-\\frac{1}{1-(2x)^2}) > 0$. Thus $\\rho_0(x) = \\rho(x)/\\rho(0) > 0$. Also, the integral $\\int_{-1/2}^x \\rho(t) dt$ is strictly positive for $x > -\\frac{1}{2}$. It follows that $\\sigma(x) > 0$ for $x \\in (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. Since $\\phi_1(x,y) = \\sigma(x) + \\frac{1}{10}\\rho_0(x)$, $\\phi_1(q)$ is the sum of two strictly positive terms and is therefore strictly positive on $U_1 \\cap U_2$.\nFor $\\phi_2(q) = 1 - \\phi_1(q)$, we note that $\\phi_2(q) = 0$ only if $\\phi_1(q)=1$. From the definition, $\\sigma(x) = 1$ only for $x \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\rho_0(x)$ is non-zero only for $x \\in (-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. On the overlap $U_1 \\cap U_2$, $x < \\frac{1}{2}$, so $\\sigma(x) < 1$. Since $\\phi_1(x,y) = \\sigma(x) + \\frac{1}{10}\\rho_0(x)$, it is not immediately obvious that $\\phi_1(q) < 1$. However, the problem statement asserts $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\}$ is a partition of unity, which implies $\\phi_1, \\phi_2 \\ge 0$. As $\\phi_1(x,y)=1$ only for $x \\ge 1/2$, we have $\\phi_1(q) < 1$ for $q \\in U_1 \\cap U_2$, and thus $\\phi_2(q) > 0$.\nSince $\\phi_1(q) > 0$, $\\phi_2(q) > 0$, $v^T G_1 v > 0$, and $v^T G_2 v > 0$ for $v \\neq 0$, the sum $\\phi_1(q) (v^T G_1 v) + \\phi_2(q) (v^T G_2 v)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $g$ is positive-definite everywhere on $U_1 \\cap U_2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix of $g(p)$ at the point $p = (0,0)$. At this point, we are given $\\phi_1(p) = \\frac{3}{5}$ and $\\phi_2(p) = \\frac{2}{5}$. The matrix $G(p)$ is:\n$$\nG(p) = \\frac{3}{5} G_1 + \\frac{2}{5} G_2 = \\frac{3}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{2}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nG(p) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{12}{5} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \\\\ \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{10}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{14}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \\\\ \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{13}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 14 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 13 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(G(p) - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{14}{5} - \\lambda & \\frac{2}{5} \\\\ \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{13}{5} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{14}{5} - \\lambda\\right) \\left(\\frac{13}{5} - \\lambda\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\left(\\frac{14}{5} + \\frac{13}{5}\\right)\\lambda + \\frac{14 \\cdot 13}{25} - \\frac{4}{25} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\frac{27}{5}\\lambda + \\frac{182-4}{25} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\frac{27}{5}\\lambda + \\frac{178}{25} = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\frac{27}{5} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{27}{5}\\right)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{178}{25}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{27}{5} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{729}{25} - \\frac{712}{25}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{27}{5} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{17}{25}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{27}{5} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{5} \\right] = \\frac{27 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{10}.\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{27 + \\sqrt{17}}{10}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{27 - \\sqrt{17}}{10}$.

The induced metric $g$ is the pullback of the Euclidean metric $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, denoted by $g = \\Phi^{*}\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$.\n\nThe components of the metric tensor $g$ in the coordinate system $(\\theta, z)$ are given by $g_{ij} = \\langle \\partial_i\\Phi, \\partial_j\\Phi \\rangle$, where $i,j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, and $\\partial_1 = \\partial_\\theta$, $\\partial_2 = \\partial_z$.\n\nFirst, we compute the tangent basis vectors by differentiating $\\Phi$ with respect to the coordinates $\\theta$ and $z$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\theta}\\Phi = \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}\\big(R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta, z\\big) = \\big(-R\\sin\\theta, R\\cos\\theta, 0\\big)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{z}\\Phi = \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\big(R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta, z\\big) = \\big(0, 0, 1\\big)\n$$\nThese two vectors form a basis for the tangent space $T_p C_R$ at each point $p \\in C_R$.\n\nNext, we compute the components of the metric tensor $g$ by taking the Euclidean inner product of these basis vectors:\n$$\ng_{\\theta\\theta} = \\langle \\partial_{\\theta}\\Phi, \\partial_{\\theta}\\Phi \\rangle = \\langle \\big(-R\\sin\\theta, R\\cos\\theta, 0\\big), \\big(-R\\sin\\theta, R\\cos\\theta, 0\\big) \\rangle\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\theta\\theta} = (-R\\sin\\theta)^2 + (R\\cos\\theta)^2 + 0^2 = R^2\\sin^2\\theta + R^2\\cos^2\\theta = R^2(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) = R^2\n$$\n\n$$\ng_{zz} = \\langle \\partial_{z}\\Phi, \\partial_{z}\\Phi \\rangle = \\langle \\big(0, 0, 1\\big), \\big(0, 0, 1\\big) \\rangle = 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1\n$$\n\n$$\ng_{\\theta z} = g_{z\\theta} = \\langle \\partial_{\\theta}\\Phi, \\partial_{z}\\Phi \\rangle = \\langle \\big(-R\\sin\\theta, R\\cos\\theta, 0\\big), \\big(0, 0, 1\\big) \\rangle\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\theta z} = (-R\\sin\\theta)(0) + (R\\cos\\theta)(0) + (0)(1) = 0\n$$\nIn matrix form, with respect to the coordinate basis $(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_z)$, the metric tensor is:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{\\theta\\theta} & g_{\\theta z} \\\\ g_{z\\theta} & g_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} R^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe line element $ds^2$ associated with this metric is given by $ds^2 = \\sum_{i,j} g_{ij} du^i du^j$:\n$$\nds^2 = g_{\\theta\\theta} d\\theta^2 + 2 g_{\\theta z} d\\theta dz + g_{zz} dz^2 = R^2 d\\theta^2 + dz^2\n$$\n\nTo verify that this metric is flat, we must show that its Riemann curvature tensor vanishes. The components of the Riemann tensor $R^i_{jkl}$ can be computed from the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$. The formula for the Christoffel symbols is:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial u^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial u^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial u^l} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $(g^{kl})$ is the inverse of the metric tensor $(g_{ij})$ and $u^i$ are the coordinates $(\\theta, z)$.\n\nThe metric components are $g_{\\theta\\theta} = R^2$, $g_{zz} = 1$, and $g_{\\theta z} = 0$. Since $R$ is a constant, all these components are constant functions of the coordinates $\\theta$ and $z$.\nTherefore, all partial derivatives of the metric components with respect to the coordinates are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial u^k} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i,j,k \\in \\{\\theta, z\\}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find:\n$$\n\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0\n$$\nAll Christoffel symbols of the second kind are identically zero for this metric in these coordinates.\n\nThe components of the Riemann curvature tensor are given by:\n$$\nR^i_{jkl} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^i_{jl}}{\\partial u^k} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^i_{jk}}{\\partial u^l} + \\sum_{p} \\left( \\Gamma^p_{jl}\\Gamma^i_{pk} - \\Gamma^p_{jk}\\Gamma^i_{pl} \\right)\n$$\nSince all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. Consequently, every term in the expression for $R^i_{jkl}$ is zero.\n$$\nR^i_{jkl} = 0 - 0 + \\sum_{p} (0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0) = 0\n$$\nThe Riemann curvature tensor vanishes identically, which confirms, from first principles, that the induced metric on the cylinder is flat. This is consistent with the geometric intuition that a cylinder can be unrolled into a flat plane without distortion.\n\nThe final answer is the explicit expression for the line element derived above.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{ds^{2} = R^{2} d\\theta^{2} + dz^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2975264"}]}
