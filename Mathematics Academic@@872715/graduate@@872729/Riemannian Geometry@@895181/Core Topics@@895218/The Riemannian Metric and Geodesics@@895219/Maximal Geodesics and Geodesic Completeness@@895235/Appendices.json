The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of Riemannian geometry, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution.\n\nThe Riemannian manifold is $(M,g)$, where $M$ is the open strip in the Euclidean plane defined by $M = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : 0  x  1\\}$, and the metric $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric $dx^{2}+dy^{2}$ restricted to $M$. Since $M$ is an open submanifold of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, its Levi-Civita connection is the restriction of the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Consequently, the geodesics of $(M,g)$ are segments of straight lines, as given by the general solution $\\gamma(t) = p + tv$, for as long as the path remains inside $M$.\n\n**Task 1: Metric Incompleteness**\n\nTo show that $(M,g)$ is not metrically complete, we must construct a Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ that does not converge to a point within $M$. Let us consider the sequence of points $\\{p_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in $M$ defined by $p_{n} = (\\frac{1}{n+2}, 0)$. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, the $x$-coordinate $x_{n} = \\frac{1}{n+2}$ satisfies $0  \\frac{1}{n+2}  1$, so each point $p_{n}$ is indeed in $M$.\n\nNext, we show that $\\{p_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence. The distance between two points $p_{n}$ and $p_{m}$ in $(M,g)$ is the Euclidean distance in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$d(p_{n}, p_{m}) = \\|p_{n} - p_{m}\\| = \\left\\| \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2}, 0\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{m+2}, 0\\right) \\right\\| = \\left| \\frac{1}{n+2} - \\frac{1}{m+2} \\right|$$\nFor any $\\epsilon  0$, we need to find an integer $N$ such that for all $n,m  N$, $d(p_{n}, p_{m})  \\epsilon$.\nUsing the triangle inequality, for $n,m  N$:\n$$d(p_{n}, p_{m}) \\le \\left| \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right| + \\left| \\frac{1}{m+2} \\right| = \\frac{1}{n+2} + \\frac{1}{m+2}  \\frac{1}{N+2} + \\frac{1}{N+2} = \\frac{2}{N+2}$$\nWe can ensure $\\frac{2}{N+2}  \\epsilon$ by choosing $N$ such that $N+2  \\frac{2}{\\epsilon}$, or $N  \\frac{2}{\\epsilon} - 2$. Such an integer $N$ exists for any $\\epsilon  0$. Thus, $\\{p_{n}\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nNow, we examine the convergence of this sequence. In the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the sequence converges to:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} p_{n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{n+2}, 0\\right) = (0, 0)$$\nThe limit point $p_{\\infty} = (0,0)$ has an $x$-coordinate of $0$, which does not satisfy the condition $0  x  1$ for membership in $M$. Therefore, the limit point is not in $M$. Since a convergent sequence in a metric space has a unique limit, and the limit of $\\{p_{n}\\}$ in the larger space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not in $M$, the sequence cannot converge to any point within $M$. This demonstrates that $(M,g)$ is not a metrically complete space.\n\n**Task 2: Geodesic Incompleteness**\n\nA Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if every maximal geodesic can be defined for all parameter values $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The geodesics in $(M,g)$ are straight lines. Let's consider a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at a point $p=(x_{0}, y_{0}) \\in M$ with a non-zero velocity component in the $x$-direction, $v=(v_{x}, v_{y})$ with $v_{x} \\neq 0$. The path is given by $\\gamma(t) = (x_{0}+tv_{x}, y_{0}+tv_{y})$.\n\nFor this path to remain in $M$, its $x$-coordinate must satisfy $0  x_{0}+tv_{x}  1$.\nIf $v_{x}  0$, the geodesic moves towards the boundary line $x=1$. The condition $x_{0}+tv_{x}  1$ implies $tv_{x}  1-x_{0}$, or $t  \\frac{1-x_{0}}{v_{x}}$. The geodesic exits $M$ at the finite positive time $t = \\frac{1-x_{0}}{v_{x}}$.\nIf $v_{x}  0$, the geodesic moves towards the boundary line $x=0$. The condition $x_{0}+tv_{x}  0$ implies $tv_{x}  -x_{0}$. Since $v_{x}$ is negative, dividing by it reverses the inequality: $t  \\frac{-x_{0}}{v_{x}} = \\frac{x_{0}}{|v_{x}|}$. The geodesic exits $M$ at the finite positive time $t=\\frac{x_{0}}{|v_{x}|}$.\n\nIn either case, if $v_{x} \\neq 0$, the geodesic cannot be extended for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its maximal domain of definition is a finite open interval, not $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. This failure of at least one geodesic to be defined for all real parameter values means that $(M,g)$ is not geodesically complete. This is consistent with the Hopf-Rinow theorem, which states that geodesic completeness is equivalent to metric completeness for a connected Riemannian manifold. Since we found $(M,g)$ to be metrically incomplete, it must also be geodesically incomplete.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Forward Endpoint $t_{+}$**\n\nWe are given a point $p=(x_{0},y_{0}) \\in M$, which means $0  x_{0}  1$. We are also given an initial velocity $v=(v_{x},v_{y})$ such that $|v|=\\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}=1$ and $v_{x}0$. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with velocity $v$ is given by:\n$$\\gamma(t) = p + tv = (x_{0}, y_{0}) + t(v_{x}, v_{y}) = (x_{0} + tv_{x}, y_{0} + tv_{y})$$\nThis is a unit-speed geodesic. We seek the forward endpoint $t_{+}$ of the maximal open interval of definition $(t_{-}, t_{+})$. This is the largest positive time for which the geodesic remains in $M$. The condition for $\\gamma(t) \\in M$ is $0  x(t)  1$, where $x(t) = x_{0} + tv_{x}$. The $y$-coordinate $y(t) = y_{0}+tv_{y}$ is not restricted.\n\nWe must satisfy the two inequalities for $t  0$:\n1. $x_{0} + tv_{x}  0$\n2. $x_{0} + tv_{x}  1$\n\nLet's analyze the first inequality. We are given $x_{0}0$ and $v_{x}0$. For any $t  0$, the term $tv_{x}$ is positive. Therefore, $x_{0} + tv_{x}$ is also positive, and this inequality is always satisfied for $t0$.\n\nNow let's analyze the second inequality, which imposes the actual constraint:\n$$x_{0} + tv_{x}  1$$\nWe can solve for $t$:\n$$tv_{x}  1 - x_{0}$$\nSince we are given $v_{x}  0$, we can divide by $v_{x}$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$t  \\frac{1 - x_{0}}{v_{x}}$$\nThis inequality gives the upper bound on the parameter $t$ for which the geodesic stays within $M$. The geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is defined on the interval $[0, T)$ for any $T \\le \\frac{1 - x_{0}}{v_{x}}$. The maximal such interval for positive time extends up to, but does not include, the point where the path hits the boundary. The supremum of all such $t$ values is the forward endpoint $t_{+}$.\nTherefore, the forward endpoint of the maximal interval is:\n$$t_{+} = \\frac{1 - x_{0}}{v_{x}}$$\nFor completeness, the backward endpoint $t_{-}$ would be found by considering $t0$. The condition $x_0 + tv_x  0$ with $v_x  0$ gives $tv_x  -x_0$, so $t  -x_0/v_x$. Thus $t_{-} = -x_0/v_x$. The full maximal interval is $(-\\frac{x_0}{v_x}, \\frac{1-x_0}{v_x})$. The problem only asks for $t_{+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1-x_{0}}{v_{x}}}$$", "id": "2983402"}, {"introduction": "While removing points from a manifold can lead to incompleteness, the nature of this incompleteness depends critically on the metric.

We will proceed in two steps as requested.\n\nFirst, we will show that a geodesic with initial conditions corresponding to no initial angular velocity remains purely radial. Geodesics are critical points of the energy functional. For a curve $\\gamma(t) = (r(t), \\omega(t))$ in polar coordinates, where $r(t) \\in (0,1)$ is the radial coordinate and $\\omega(t) \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is the angular coordinate, the tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. The metric in these coordinates is given as $g_{\\alpha} = r^{2\\alpha} (dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\Omega^{2})$. The squared norm of the tangent vector is therefore $g_{\\alpha}(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = r(t)^{2\\alpha} (\\dot{r}(t)^{2} + r(t)^{2} \\|\\dot{\\omega}(t)\\|^{2}_{d\\Omega^{2}})$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}}$ is the norm on the tangent space of $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ induced by its standard metric $d\\Omega^{2}$.\n\nThe energy functional is $E(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int g_{\\alpha}(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) dt$. The Lagrangian for this system is:\n$$ L(r, \\dot{r}, \\omega, \\dot{\\omega}) = \\frac{1}{2} r^{2\\alpha} (\\dot{r}^{2} + r^{2} \\|\\dot{\\omega}\\|^{2}_{d\\Omega^{2}}) $$\nThe metric $g_{\\alpha}$ is invariant under rotations, which act as isometries on the spheres of constant radius $r$. This rotational symmetry implies that the Lagrangian does not depend on the angular coordinate $\\omega$ itself, only on its velocity $\\dot{\\omega}$. In the language of variational calculus, the angular coordinates are cyclic. By Noether's theorem, this symmetry leads to a conserved quantity, which can be interpreted as the angular momentum.\n\nLet's derive this conservation law from the Euler-Lagrange equations. The equations for the angular coordinates $\\omega$ lead to the conservation of the conjugate momentum. More formally, let's consider the quantity $|J(t)| = r(t)^{2(\\alpha+1)} \\|\\dot{\\omega}(t)\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}}$, which represents the magnitude of the conserved angular momentum. Its constancy along any geodesic can be shown by deriving the full geodesic equations. However, a more direct argument is that since the Lagrangian has no explicit dependence on $\\omega$, the generalized momentum conjugate to $\\omega$ is covariantly conserved. The magnitude of this momentum vector is constant. Let's denote this constant value by $C$.\n$$ C = r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\|\\dot{\\omega}(t)\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}} $$\nThe value of this constant $C$ is determined by the initial conditions of the geodesic. The problem specifies the initial conditions at $t=0$ as $r(0) = r_{0} \\in (0,1)$ and $\\dot{\\omega}(0) = 0$. The initial magnitude of the angular velocity is $\\|\\dot{\\omega}(0)\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}} = 0$.\nSubstituting these initial conditions into the conservation equation, we find the value of the constant $C$:\n$$ C = r(0)^{2\\alpha+2} \\|\\dot{\\omega}(0)\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}} = r_{0}^{2\\alpha+2} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nSince $C$ must be zero for all time $t$ along the geodesic, we have:\n$$ r(t)^{2\\alpha+2} \\|\\dot{\\omega}(t)\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}} = 0 $$\nThe geodesic exists within the manifold $M$, where $r(t) \\in (0,1)$. Thus, $r(t)$ is strictly positive. This implies that the other factor in the product must be zero:\n$$ \\|\\dot{\\omega}(t)\\|_{d\\Omega^{2}} = 0 $$\nThis means that the angular velocity vector $\\dot{\\omega}(t)$ is the zero vector for all $t$. Integrating with respect to time gives $\\omega(t) = \\omega(0) =$ constant. This completes the demonstration that the geodesic is purely radial.\n\nNext, we determine the maximal arc-length $s_{\\ast}$ for an inward-moving radial geodesic starting at $r=r_0$. A radial geodesic is a curve $\\gamma(s) = (r(s), \\omega_{0})$, where $s$ is the arc-length parameter and $\\omega_0$ is a constant position on $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. For such a curve, $\\dot{\\omega} = 0$, so its velocity vector is $\\gamma'(s) = \\frac{dr}{ds} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\n\nThe condition for $s$ to be the arc-length parameter is that the tangent vector has unit length with respect to the metric $g_{\\alpha}$, i.e., $g_{\\alpha}(\\gamma'(s), \\gamma'(s)) = 1$.\n$$ g_{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{dr}{ds} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, \\frac{dr}{ds} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) = r(s)^{2\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^{2} = 1 $$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$$ r(s)^{\\alpha} \\frac{dr}{ds} = \\pm 1 $$\nThe problem states that the geodesic moves inward, which means the radius $r$ decreases as the arc-length $s$ increases. Therefore, the derivative $\\frac{dr}{ds}$ must be negative. We must choose the negative sign:\n$$ r^{\\alpha} \\frac{dr}{ds} = -1 $$\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating.\n$$ r^{\\alpha} dr = -ds $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state $(s, r) = (0, r_{0})$ to a generic state $(s, r(s))$.\n$$ \\int_{r_{0}}^{r(s)} \\rho^{\\alpha} d\\rho = \\int_{0}^{s} (-1) d\\tau $$\nThe condition $\\alpha  -1$ ensures that $\\alpha+1  0$, so the integral on the left is well-defined and non-singular at the lower limit of integration for the final calculation.

The maximal arc-length $s_{\\ast}$ corresponds to the geodesic reaching the puncture at $r=0$. We can find this value by taking the limit of $s(r)$ as $r$ approaches $0$ from above ($r \\to 0^{+}$).\n$$ s_{\\ast} = \\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} \\left( \\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1} - r^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} \\right) $$\nSince $\\alpha  -1$, the exponent $\\alpha+1$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the term $r^{\\alpha+1}$ approaches $0$ as $r \\to 0^{+}$.\n$$ \\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} r^{\\alpha+1} = 0 $$\nSubstituting this limit into the expression for $s_{\\ast}$ yields the final result:\n$$ s_{\\ast} = \\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1} - 0}{\\alpha+1} = \\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1} $$\nThis finite value indicates that for $\\alpha  -1$, the manifold $(M, g_{\\alpha})$ is geodesically incomplete towards the puncture at the origin.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{r_{0}^{\\alpha+1}}{\\alpha+1}} $$", "id": "2983384"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a metric structure can lead to incompleteness, we now explore the reverse: can we choose a metric to make a seemingly incomplete space complete?

Therefore, $|\\ln(1/s)| = \\ln(1/s)$.\nThe definite integral is:\n$$\nL_{g}(\\gamma) = \\left[ -\\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{s}\\right)\\right) \\right]_{r_0}^r = -\\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\right) - \\left(-\\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r_0}\\right)\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nL_{g}(\\gamma) = \\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r_0}\\right)\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(A) - \\ln(B) = \\ln(A/B)$, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nL_{g}(\\gamma) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln(1/r_0)}{\\ln(1/r)}\\right)\n$$\nThis can also be written as $\\ln\\left(\\frac{-\\ln(r_0)}{-\\ln(r)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln(r_0)}{\\ln(r)}\\right)$. Given the definition of $\\Omega(r)$, the form using $\\ln(1/r)$ is more direct.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2983368"}]}
