We shall proceed with the solution by systematically applying the given definitions.\n\nLet the ambient space be $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ equipped with its standard Euclidean metric, denoted by the inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$, and the associated Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ of a vector field $Y$ along a vector field $X$ is simply the directional derivative of the components of $Y$ in the direction of $X$.\n\nThe surface $S$ is given by the immersion $i: U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the position vector $\\mathbf{x}(u,v) = i(u,v)$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(u,v) = \\left(u, v, \\frac{1}{2}(a u^2 + 2buv + cv^2)\\right)\n$$\nfor real constants $a, b, c$. We are interested in the geometric properties at the point corresponding to $(u,v) = (0,0)$, which is $\\mathbf{x}(0,0) = (0,0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the tangent basis vectors on the surface, which are the images of the coordinate basis vectors $\\partial_u$ and $\\partial_v$ under the differential of the immersion, $di$.

Let $(A_{ij})$ be the matrix representing $A_{\\nu}$, so $A_{\\nu}e_i = \\sum_l A_{li} e_l$. Then $\\langle A_{\\nu}e_i, e_j \\rangle = \\langle \\sum_l A_{li} e_l, e_j \\rangle = \\sum_l A_{li} \\delta_{lj} = A_{ji}$.\nSo, $h_{ij}^{1} = A_{ji}$. The matrix of $A_{\\nu}$ is:\n$$\n[A_{\\nu}] = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{11}  A_{12} \\\\ A_{21}  A_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} h_{11}^{1}  h_{21}^{1} \\\\ h_{12}^{1}  h_{22}^{1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} h_{11}^{1}  h_{12}^{1} \\\\ h_{12}^{1}  h_{22}^{1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace and determinant of this matrix are:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}) = h_{11}^{1} + h_{22}^{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A_{\\nu}) = h_{11}^{1}h_{22}^{1} - (h_{12}^{1})^2\n$$\nOur goal is to express $|B|^2(p) = (h_{11}^{1})^2 + 2(h_{12}^{1})^2 + (h_{22}^{1})^2$ using only $\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu})$ and $\\det(A_{\\nu})$.\nLet's consider the square of the trace:\n$$\n(\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}))^2 = (h_{11}^{1} + h_{22}^{1})^2 = (h_{11}^{1})^2 + 2h_{11}^{1}h_{22}^{1} + (h_{22}^{1})^2\n$$\nComparing this with the expression for $|B|^2(p)$, we can write:\n$$\n(\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}))^2 = \\left( (h_{11}^{1})^2 + 2(h_{12}^{1})^2 + (h_{22}^{1})^2 \\right) + 2h_{11}^{1}h_{22}^{1} - 2(h_{12}^{1})^2\n$$\n$$\n(\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}))^2 = |B|^2(p) + 2(h_{11}^{1}h_{22}^{1} - (h_{12}^{1})^2)\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is exactly the determinant of $A_{\\nu}$.\n$$\n(\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}))^2 = |B|^2(p) + 2\\det(A_{\\nu})\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $|B|^2(p)$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\n|B|^2(p) = (\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}))^2 - 2\\det(A_{\\nu})\n$$\nThis result expresses the squared norm of the second fundamental form for a surface in terms of the trace and determinant of its shape operator, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(\\operatorname{tr}(A_{\\nu}))^2 - 2\\det(A_{\\nu})}\n$$", "id": "3003228"}]}
