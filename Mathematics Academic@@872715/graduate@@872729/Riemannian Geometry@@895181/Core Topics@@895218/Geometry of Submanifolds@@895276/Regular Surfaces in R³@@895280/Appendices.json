The points $(x, y, z)$ on the cone satisfy the equation $z = \\lambda\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$, where $\\lambda > 0$ is a constant. We are tasked with constructing a suitable parametrization, computing the rank of its differential, and identifying the parameter value corresponding to the singular point of the cone.\n\n**1. Construction of the Parametrization**\n\nTo construct a parametrization that respects the rotational symmetry about the $z$-axis, we use a coordinate system analogous to cylindrical coordinates. Let the parameter $u$ represent the radial distance from the $z$-axis in the $xy$-plane, i.e., $u = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. Let the parameter $v$ be the angle in the $xy$-plane, measured from the positive $x$-axis.\n\nThe standard relationships are:\n$x = u \\cos(v)$\n$y = u \\sin(v)$\n\nSubstituting $u = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ into the cone's equation gives $z = \\lambda u$. We must define the domain for the parameters $(u,v)$. To cover the entire cone, $u$ must range from $0$ (for the apex) to infinity. Thus, we define $u \\in [0, \\infty)$. The angle $v$ must cover a full circle, so we define $v \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThis yields the parametrization $X: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the parameter domain is $U = [0, \\infty) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$ and the map $X$ is given by:\n$$X(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)) = (u \\cos(v), u \\sin(v), \\lambda u)$$\nThe component functions of $X(u,v)$ are constructed from polynomials, trigonometric functions, and constants. These functions are infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) on their entire domains. Therefore, the map $X$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ map.\n\n**2. Computation of the Differential $dX$ and its Rank**\n\nA point on a parametrized surface is regular if the differential map $dX$ at that point is injective, which for a surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ means its rank is $2$. The rank of $dX$ is the dimension of the image of the map, which is spanned by the partial derivative vectors $X_u = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial u}$ and $X_v = \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial v}$. The rank is $2$ if and only if these two vectors are linearly independent.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative vectors:\n$$X_u(u,v) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (u \\cos(v), u \\sin(v), \\lambda u) = (\\cos(v), \\sin(v), \\lambda)$$\n$$X_v(u,v) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} (u \\cos(v), u \\sin(v), \\lambda u) = (-u \\sin(v), u \\cos(v), 0)$$\n\nThe matrix of the differential $dX$ (the Jacobian matrix) with respect to the standard basis is formed by these column vectors:\n$$dX_{(u,v)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(v)  -u \\sin(v) \\\\ \\sin(v)  u \\cos(v) \\\\ \\lambda  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nTo determine where the vectors $X_u$ and $X_v$ are linearly independent, we compute their cross product. The vectors are linearly independent if and only if their cross product is non-zero.\n$$X_u \\times X_v = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i}  \\mathbf{j}  \\mathbf{k} \\\\ \\cos(v)  \\sin(v)  \\lambda \\\\ -u \\sin(v)  u \\cos(v)  0 \\end{vmatrix}$$\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n$$X_u \\times X_v = \\mathbf{i} ((\\sin(v))(0) - (\\lambda)(u \\cos(v))) - \\mathbf{j} ((\\cos(v))(0) - (\\lambda)(-u \\sin(v))) + \\mathbf{k} ((\\cos(v))(u \\cos(v)) - (\\sin(v))(-u \\sin(v)))$$\n$$X_u \\times X_v = (-\\lambda u \\cos(v)) \\mathbf{i} - (\\lambda u \\sin(v)) \\mathbf{j} + (u (\\cos^{2}(v) + \\sin^{2}(v))) \\mathbf{k}$$\n$$X_u \\times X_v = (-\\lambda u \\cos(v), -\\lambda u \\sin(v), u)$$\n\nThe rank of $dX$ is $2$ if $X_u \\times X_v \\neq (0, 0, 0)$. The rank drops below $2$ if $X_u \\times X_v = (0, 0, 0)$. This condition requires:\n1. $-\\lambda u \\cos(v) = 0$\n2. $-\\lambda u \\sin(v) = 0$\n3. $u = 0$\n\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ is a given, the first two equations are satisfied if and only if $u=0$ or, for $u \\neq 0$, if both $\\cos(v)=0$ and $\\sin(v)=0$, which is impossible. Therefore, the sole condition that makes the cross product vanish is $u=0$.\n\n**3. Identification of the Singular Point**\n\nThe rank of the differential $dX$ drops from $2$ only when $u=0$.\n- For any parameter value $(u,v)$ with $u > 0$, the cross product $X_u \\times X_v$ is non-zero. This implies that $X_u$ and $X_v$ are linearly independent, so the rank of $dX$ is $2$. These correspond to the regular points of the cone.\n- For the parameter value $u=0$, the cross product is $X_u \\times X_v = (0, 0, 0)$. At $u=0$, the partial derivative vectors are:\n$$X_u(0,v) = (\\cos(v), \\sin(v), \\lambda)$$\n$$X_v(0,v) = (0, 0, 0)$$\nThe set of vectors $\\{X_u, X_v\\}$ is linearly dependent because $X_v$ is the zero vector. The vector $X_u$ is non-zero for any $v$ because $\\lambda > 0$. Therefore, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{X_u(0,v), X_v(0,v)\\}$ is $1$. This confirms that the rank of $dX$ at any point $(0,v)$ is $1$.\n\nThe unique parameter value common to all points in the parameter domain where the rank of $dX$ drops from $2$ to $1$ is $u=0$. This corresponds to the point $X(0,v) = (0, 0, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which is the apex of the cone. This failure of the rank condition is precisely why the apex is a singular point and the cone is not a regular surface in its entirety.\n\nThe problem asks for the single parameter value at which the rank drops. This value is $u=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2988476"}, {"introduction": "Having established the criteria for a regular surface, we now turn to quantifying its geometry.

By the Euler-Lagrange equations, this implies that the conjugate momentum $p_{\\varphi}$ is conserved along any geodesic:\n$$ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\varphi}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\varphi} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\varphi}}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe conserved quantity is therefore:\n$$ C = p_{\\varphi} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\varphi}} = \\frac{1}{2}R^{2}(2\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi}) = R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi} $$\nThis is the first integral associated with the rotational symmetry of the sphere.\n\nFinally, we express this quantity $C$ in terms of $R$, $\\theta$, and the angle $\\alpha$. We are given a unit-speed geodesic, so $s$ is arc length and the tangent vector $v = \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\partial_{\\varphi}$ has unit norm, i.e., $g(v,v)=1$.\n$$ g(v,v) = R^{2}\\dot{\\theta}^{2} + R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi}^{2} = 1 $$\nThe meridian direction corresponds to curves with fixed $\\varphi$, so its tangent vector is in the direction of $u = \\partial_{\\theta}$. The squared norm of this vector is $\\|u\\|^{2} = g(\\partial_{\\theta}, \\partial_{\\theta}) = R^{2}$, so $\\|u\\|=R$.\nThe angle $\\alpha$ between the geodesic tangent $v$ and the meridian direction vector $u$ is given by the dot product formula:\n$$ \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{g(v, u)}{\\|v\\| \\|u\\|} $$\nThe inner product is $g(v, u) = g(\\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\partial_{\\varphi}, \\partial_{\\theta}) = \\dot{\\theta}g_{\\theta\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}g_{\\varphi\\theta} = \\dot{\\theta}R^{2}$.\nSubstituting into the angle formula:\n$$ \\cos\\alpha = \\frac{\\dot{\\theta}R^{2}}{1 \\cdot R} = R\\dot{\\theta} $$\nTo relate $\\dot{\\varphi}$ to $\\alpha$, we interpret $\\alpha$ as the oriented angle from the normalized meridian direction to the tangent vector $v$. An orthonormal basis for the tangent plane is $\\{e_{\\theta}, e_{\\varphi}\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{R}\\partial_{\\theta}, \\frac{1}{R\\sin\\theta}\\partial_{\\varphi}\\}$. The unit tangent vector $v$ can be expressed as $v = (\\cos\\alpha) e_{\\theta} + (\\sin\\alpha) e_{\\varphi}$.\nWe also have $v = \\dot{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta} + \\dot{\\varphi}\\partial_{\\varphi} = (R\\dot{\\theta})e_{\\theta} + (R\\sin\\theta \\dot{\\varphi})e_{\\varphi}$.\nComparing the coefficients of $e_{\\varphi}$ gives:\n$$ R\\sin\\theta\\dot{\\varphi} = \\sin\\alpha \\implies \\dot{\\varphi} = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{R\\sin\\theta} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\dot{\\varphi}$ into the formula for the conserved quantity $C$:\n$$ C = R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\dot{\\varphi} = R^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{R\\sin\\theta} \\right) = R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\alpha $$\nThis result, known as Clairaut's relation, expresses the conserved angular momentum about the axis of rotation in terms of the position ($\\theta$) and the direction of the geodesic ($\\alpha$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{R\\sin\\theta\\sin\\alpha}$$", "id": "2988400"}]}
