The components are:\n1. The Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^M$ of the ambient manifold $(M, g)$, which is used to define the second fundamental form.\n2. The second fundamental form $B_g(X,Y) = (\\nabla^M_X Y)^{\\perp_g}$.\n3. The induced metric on the submanifold, $g_{\\Sigma}$, and its inverse, which is used to compute the trace.\n\nLet us denote the quantities computed with respect to the scaled metric $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$ with a subscript $\\lambda$, e.g., $\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}$, $B_{g_{\\lambda}}$, $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}$, and $H_{g_{\\lambda}}$.\n\nStep 1: Transformation of the Levi-Civita Connection\nThe Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^M$ is uniquely determined by the metric $g$ through the Koszul formula. For vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $M$, the connection $\\nabla^M$ satisfies:\n$$ 2g(\\nabla^M_X Y, Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) - g(X, [Y,Z]) + g(Y, [Z,X]) + g(Z, [X,Y]) $$\nLet $\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}$ be the Levi-Civita connection corresponding to the metric $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$. It must satisfy the same formula with $g$ replaced by $g_{\\lambda}$:\n$$ 2g_{\\lambda}(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z) = X(g_{\\lambda}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{\\lambda}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{\\lambda}(X,Y)) - g_{\\lambda}(X, [Y,Z]) + g_{\\lambda}(Y, [Z,X]) + g_{\\lambda}(Z, [X,Y]) $$\nSubstituting $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$ into the left-hand side gives $2\\lambda^2 g(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z)$.\nSubstituting into the right-hand side, and using the fact that $\\lambda$ is a constant so its derivative is zero (e.g., $X(\\lambda^2 g(Y,Z)) = \\lambda^2 X(g(Y,Z))$), we get:\n$$ \\lambda^2 \\left( X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) - g(X, [Y,Z]) + g(Y, [Z,X]) + g(Z, [X,Y]) \\right) $$\nThis expression is exactly $\\lambda^2$ times the right-hand side of the original Koszul formula for $\\nabla^M$. Thus, we have the equality:\n$$ 2\\lambda^2 g(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z) = \\lambda^2 \\left( 2g(\\nabla^M_X Y, Z) \\right) $$\nSince $\\lambda > 0$, we can divide by $2\\lambda^2$ to obtain:\n$$ g(\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y, Z) = g(\\nabla^M_X Y, Z) $$\nThis holds for all vector fields $Z$. Since the metric $g$ is non-degenerate, this implies that the two vectors are identical:\n$$ \\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y = \\nabla^M_X Y $$\nThe Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant homothetic scaling of the metric.\n\nStep 2: Transformation of the Second Fundamental Form\nThe second fundamental form with respect to $g_{\\lambda}$ is defined as $B_{g_{\\lambda}}(X, Y) = (\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}}$ for vector fields $X, Y$ tangent to $\\Sigma$.\nFrom Step 1, we know that $\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y = \\nabla^M_X Y$. Therefore, $B_{g_{\\lambda}}(X, Y) = (\\nabla^M_X Y)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}}$.\nThe operation $(\\cdot)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the normal bundle $N\\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $g_{\\lambda}$. At any point $p \\in \\Sigma$, the tangent space of the ambient manifold decomposes as $T_p M = T_p \\Sigma \\oplus (N\\Sigma)_p$. This decomposition is orthogonal, meaning that for any $v \\in T_p \\Sigma$ and $w \\in (N\\Sigma)_p$, we have $g(v, w) = 0$.\nThe orthogonality condition with respect to the new metric $g_{\\lambda}$ is $g_{\\lambda}(v, w) = \\lambda^2 g(v, w)$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, it is clear that $g_{\\lambda}(v, w) = 0$ if and only if $g(v, w) = 0$. This means that the notion of orthogonality between the tangent and normal spaces is unchanged. The subspaces $T_p\\Sigma$ and $(N\\Sigma)_p$ remain orthogonal under the scaled metric.\nThe projection of a vector $V \\in T_p M$ onto the normal space $(N\\Sigma)_p$ depends only on the direct sum decomposition $T_p M = T_p \\Sigma \\oplus (N\\Sigma)_p$, not on the specific values of the inner product. Since this decomposition is the same for both metrics, the projection operator itself is unchanged. That is, $(\\cdot)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}} = (\\cdot)^{\\perp_{g}}$.\nCombining these results, we find that the second fundamental form is invariant under the scaling:\n$$ B_{g_{\\lambda}}(X, Y) = (\\nabla^{M, \\lambda}_X Y)^{\\perp_{\\lambda}} = (\\nabla^M_X Y)^{\\perp_{g}} = B_g(X, Y) $$\n\nStep 3: Transformation of the Induced Metric and its Inverse\nThe induced metric on $\\Sigma$ with respect to $g$ is $g_{\\Sigma}$, defined by $g_{\\Sigma}(X, Y) = g(X, Y)$ for $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(T\\Sigma)$.\nThe induced metric with respect to $g_{\\lambda}$ is $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}$, defined by $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}(X, Y) = g_{\\lambda}(X, Y)$ for $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(T\\Sigma)$.\nUsing the scaling relation $g_{\\lambda} = \\lambda^2 g$, we have:\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}(X, Y) = \\lambda^2 g(X, Y) = \\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma}(X, Y) $$\nSo, the induced metric scales by a factor of $\\lambda^2$: $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma} = \\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma}$.\nNow, let's consider the components of the inverse metric, which are used to compute the trace. In a local coordinate system $\\{x^i\\}$ on $\\Sigma$, with basis vectors $e_i = \\partial/\\partial x^i$, the components of the induced metric are $g_{\\Sigma, ij} = g_{\\Sigma}(e_i, e_j)$. The components of its inverse, $g_{\\Sigma}^{ij}$, satisfy $g_{\\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\Sigma, kj} = \\delta^i_j$.\nThe components of the scaled induced metric are $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma, ij} = \\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma, ij}$. Let the inverse components be $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij}$. By definition of the inverse, we must have:\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma, kj} = \\delta^i_j $$\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} (\\lambda^2 g_{\\Sigma, kj}) = \\delta^i_j $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 (g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\Sigma, kj}) = \\delta^i_j $$\nComparing this with $g_{\\Sigma}^{ik} g_{\\Sigma, kj} = \\delta^i_j$, we see that $\\lambda^2 g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ik} = g_{\\Sigma}^{ik}$, which implies:\n$$ g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij} = \\lambda^{-2} g_{\\Sigma}^{ij} $$\nThe components of the inverse induced metric scale by a factor of $\\lambda^{-2}$.\n\nStep 4: Assembling the Final Result\nThe mean curvature vector is defined as the trace of the second fundamental form. In local coordinates, this is:\n$$ H_g = g_{\\Sigma}^{ij} B_g(e_i, e_j) $$\nThe mean curvature vector with respect to the scaled metric $g_{\\lambda}$ is:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij} B_{g_{\\lambda}}(e_i, e_j) $$\nNow, we substitute the transformation laws derived in the previous steps:\n1. $g_{\\lambda, \\Sigma}^{ij} = \\lambda^{-2} g_{\\Sigma}^{ij}$ (from Step 3)\n2. $B_{g_{\\lambda}}(e_i, e_j) = B_g(e_i, e_j)$ (from Step 2)\nSubstituting these into the expression for $H_{g_{\\lambda}}$ gives:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = (\\lambda^{-2} g_{\\Sigma}^{ij}) B_g(e_i, e_j) $$\nFactoring out the constant $\\lambda^{-2}$:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = \\lambda^{-2} \\left( g_{\\Sigma}^{ij} B_g(e_i, e_j) \\right) $$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is precisely the definition of the original mean curvature vector, $H_g$.\nTherefore, we arrive at the final scaling law:\n$$ H_{g_{\\lambda}} = \\lambda^{-2} H_g $$\nThe mean curvature vector scales inversely with the square of the homothetic scaling factor $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda^{-2} H_{g}}$$", "id": "3000892"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract principles to a classic geometric construction, this problem invites you to compute the mean curvature of a cone in Euclidean space [@problem_id:3000913].

We will derive this by directly computing the shape operator of the cone.\n\nFirst, we establish our sign convention for the curvature quantities. Let $M$ be an oriented hypersurface embedded in an ambient Riemannian manifold $\\bar{M}$, with a chosen unit normal vector field $\\nu$. The shape operator (or Weingarten map) $S_p: T_p M \\to T_p M$ at a point $p \\in M$ is defined by $S_p(v) = -(\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu)^{\\top}$, where $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is the covariant derivative in $\\bar{M}$ and $(\\cdot)^{\\top}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the tangent space $T_p M$. The mean curvature scalar, which we will denote by the symbol $h$ to avoid confusion with the vector, is the trace of the shape operator: $h_M(p) = \\text{tr}(S_p)$. The mean curvature vector is then defined as $H_M(p) = h_M(p) \\nu(p)$. In the context of this problem, the ambient manifold is Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, so the covariant derivative $\\bar{\\nabla}$ is the standard directional derivative, which we denote by $D$.\n\nLet $x$ be a point on the cone $C \\setminus \\{0\\}$. By definition, $x$ can be written as $x = r p$ for a unique $r > 0$ and $p \\in \\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{S}^m$. The problem states that the cone is oriented by the unit normal field $\\nu_C(x) = \\nu_C(r p) := \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$, where $\\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$ is the unit normal to $\\Sigma$ within the tangent space $T_p \\mathbb{S}^m$. This means $\\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$ is orthogonal to $T_p \\Sigma$ and also tangent to $\\mathbb{S}^m$ at $p$, which implies $\\langle \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p), p \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_x C$ at $x=rp$ is an $m$-dimensional vector space. It is spanned by vectors arising from differentiating the position vector $x=rp$ with respect to $r$ and with respect to parameters on $\\Sigma$. The radial direction gives the tangent vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(rp) = p$. Tangent vectors to $\\Sigma$ at $p$, which form an $(m-1)$-dimensional space $T_p\\Sigma$, also lie in $T_x C$. Since any vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$ is tangent to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^m$ at $p$, it is orthogonal to the position vector $p$. Thus, $T_x C$ is the orthogonal direct sum of the radial direction and the tangential directions from $\\Sigma$: $T_x C = \\text{span}\\{p\\} \\oplus T_p\\Sigma$. Consequently, an orthonormal basis for $T_x C$ can be formed by $\\{p, e_1, \\ldots, e_{m-1}\\}$, where $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_{m-1}\\}$ is any orthonormal basis for $T_p\\Sigma$.\n\nTo compute the mean curvature scalar $h_C(x) = \\text{tr}(S_C)$, we will find the trace of the shape operator $S_C$ with respect to this basis.\n$h_C(x) = \\langle S_C(p), p \\rangle + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \\langle S_C(e_i), e_i \\rangle$.\n\nLet's compute the action of $S_C(v) = -(D_v \\nu_C)^{\\top}$ on the basis vectors.\n\n1.  Action on the radial vector $p$:\n    We compute $D_p \\nu_C$. This is the directional derivative of the field $\\nu_C$ in the direction $p$. The normal field is given by $\\nu_C(rp') = \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p')$. To find the derivative at $x=rp$ in the direction $p$, we consider the curve $\\gamma(t) = (r+t)p$. The normal along this curve is $\\nu_C(\\gamma(t)) = \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)$, which is constant. Therefore,\n    $$\n    D_p \\nu_C = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_C((r+t)p) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) = 0.\n    $$\n    This implies $S_C(p) = - (0)^{\\top} = 0$. The principal curvature in the radial direction is $0$. Thus, the first term in the trace expansion, $\\langle S_C(p), p \\rangle$, is $0$.\n\n2.  Action on a tangential vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$:\n    Let $v$ be any vector in $T_p\\Sigma$. To compute $D_v\\nu_C$, we consider a curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $C$ passing through $x=rp$ at $t=0$ with velocity $v$. Let $\\alpha(s)$ be a curve in $\\Sigma$ with $\\alpha(0)=p$ and $\\alpha'(0)=v$. We can define a curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $C$ as $\\gamma(t) = r \\cdot \\alpha(t/r)$. Its velocity at $t=0$ is $\\gamma'(0) = r \\cdot \\alpha'(0) \\cdot (1/r) = v$, as desired. The normal vector field along this curve is $\\nu_C(\\gamma(t)) = \\nu_{\\Sigma}(\\alpha(t/r))$. The directional derivative is:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_C = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_C(\\gamma(t)) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(\\alpha(t/r)).\n    $$\n    Using the chain rule, this becomes:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_C = \\left( \\frac{d}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=0} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(\\alpha(s)) \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{r} D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}.\n    $$\n    Here $D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is the covariant derivative of the vector field $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ (defined on $\\Sigma$) in the direction $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$, calculated in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. We relate this to the geometry of $\\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{S}^m$. Let $\\bar{\\nabla}$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $\\mathbb{S}^m$. The Gauss formula for $\\mathbb{S}^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ states $D_X Y = \\bar{\\nabla}_X Y - \\langle X, Y \\rangle P$, where $P$ is the position vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^m$ (i.e. the outward normal). Applying this to the vector field $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ (which is tangent to $\\mathbb{S}^m$ along $\\Sigma$) and a vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$, we get:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = \\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} - \\langle v, \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) \\rangle p.\n    $$\n    Since $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is the normal to $\\Sigma$ within $T_p\\mathbb{S}^m$, it is orthogonal to any vector $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$. Thus, $\\langle v, \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) \\rangle = 0$. This simplifies the expression to $D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = \\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}$.\n    By definition of the shape operator $S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}$ of $\\Sigma$ in $\\mathbb{S}^m$ (with respect to normal $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$), we have $S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v) = -(\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma})^{\\top_{\\Sigma}}$, where $\\top_{\\Sigma}$ is projection onto $T_p\\Sigma$. As $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is a unit vector field on $\\Sigma$, $\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma}$ is automatically orthogonal to $\\nu_{\\Sigma}$, meaning it lies in $T_p \\Sigma$. So, $\\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = -S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v)$.\n    Combining these results, we find:\n    $$\n    D_v \\nu_C = \\frac{1}{r} D_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{1}{r} \\bar{\\nabla}_v \\nu_{\\Sigma} = -\\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v).\n    $$\n    The shape operator of the cone acts on $v \\in T_p\\Sigma$ as $S_C(v) = -(D_v \\nu_C)^{\\top}$. The vector $S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v)$ is in $T_p\\Sigma$, which is a subspace of $T_x C$. Therefore, the projection $(\\cdot)^{\\top}$ is the identity on this vector:\n    $$\n    S_C(v) = - \\left( -\\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v) \\right) = \\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(v).\n    $$\n\nNow we compute the mean curvature scalar $h_C(x)$. Let $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_{m-1}\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_p\\Sigma$.\n$$\nh_C(x) = \\text{tr}(S_C) = \\langle S_C(p), p \\rangle + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \\langle S_C(e_i), e_i \\rangle \\\\\n= 0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r} S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(e_i), e_i \\right\\rangle \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \\langle S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}(e_i), e_i \\rangle \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{r} \\text{tr}(S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m}).\n$$\nThe quantity $\\text{tr}(S_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathbb{S}^m})$ is, by definition, the mean curvature scalar of $\\Sigma$ as a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{S}^m$, denoted in the problem by $H_{\\Sigma}(p)$. So, $h_C(rp) = \\frac{H_{\\Sigma}(p)}{r}$.\n\nFinally, the mean curvature vector $H_C$ at $x=rp$ is given by $H_C(x) = h_C(x) \\nu_C(x)$. Substituting the expressions for the scalar curvature and the normal vector:\n$$\nH_C(r p) = \\frac{H_{\\Sigma}(p)}{r} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p).\n$$\n\nThe singular behavior of $H_C$ as $r \\to 0$ is evident from this formula. As the point $x=rp$ approaches the apex of the cone at the origin ($r \\to 0$), the magnitude of the mean curvature vector, $\\|H_C(rp)\\| = \\frac{|H_{\\Sigma}(p)|}{r}$, blows up at a rate of $r^{-1}$, provided that $H_{\\Sigma}(p) \\neq 0$. The apex of the cone is a curvature singularity.\n\nA special and important case arises when $\\Sigma$ is a minimal hypersurface in $\\mathbb{S}^m$. By definition, this means its mean curvature scalar is zero everywhere, i.e., $H_{\\Sigma}(p) = 0$ for all $p \\in \\Sigma$. In this situation, the formula for the mean curvature vector of the cone yields:\n$$\nH_C(rp) = \\frac{0}{r} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } r>0.\n$$\nThis demonstrates the significant result that the cone over a minimal hypersurface of the sphere is itself a minimal hypersurface in Euclidean space (away from the singular apex).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{H_{\\Sigma}(p)}{r} \\nu_{\\Sigma}(p)}\n$$", "id": "3000913"}, {"introduction": "To truly grasp the geometric meaning of the mean curvature vector, it helps to understand what it captures and what it leaves out.

Thus, the decomposition is orthogonal. The Pythagorean theorem gives $|A|^2 = |A^\\circ|^2 + |\\frac{1}{m}g \\otimes H|^2$. The norm-squared of the second term is $|\\frac{1}{m}g \\otimes H|^2 = \\frac{1}{m^2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^m (g(e_i,e_j))^2 |H|^2 = \\frac{m}{m^2}|H|^2 = \\frac{1}{m}|H|^2$ for an orthonormal basis. So, the identity $|A|^2=|A^\\circ|^2+\\frac{1}{m}\\,|H|^2$ holds. The statement is correct.\n\n**C. Incorrect.** A minimal immersion has $H \\equiv 0$. The decomposition becomes $A = A^\\circ$. This means the second fundamental form is trace-free, but not necessarily zero. A totally geodesic immersion ($A \\equiv 0$) is minimal, but the converse is false. For example, the catenoid in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is minimal ($H=0$) but curved ($A \\neq 0$), so for it, $A^\\circ = A \\neq 0$.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** In codimension one, $A^\\circ \\equiv 0$ means the hypersurface is totally umbilic, which is equivalent to all principal curvatures being equal at each point. This first part is correct. However, the claim that this characterizes only totally geodesic hypersurfaces in a space form is false. A sphere $S^m(r)$ in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ is totally umbilic (all principal curvatures are $1/r$) but not totally geodesic.\n\n**E. Correct.** For a closed surface ($m=2$) in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the Gauss equation is $S_g = |H|^2 - |A|^2$, where $S_g$ is the scalar curvature. Using the identity from B, $|A|^2 = |A^\\circ|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}|H|^2$, we can express $|A^\\circ|^2 = |A|^2 - \\frac{1}{2}|H|^2 = (|H|^2 - S_g) - \\frac{1}{2}|H|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}|H|^2 - S_g$. Integrating over the surface $M$ gives $\\int_M |A^\\circ|^2 d\\mu_g = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_M |H|^2 d\\mu_g - \\int_M S_g d\\mu_g$. The first integral on the right is half the Willmore energy, which is a conformal invariant. The second integral, by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, equals $4\\pi\\chi(M)$, a topological invariant. Since the integral is a linear combination of a conformal invariant and a topological invariant, it is itself conformally invariant.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A, B, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "3000896"}]}
