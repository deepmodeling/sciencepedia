We can proceed with a step-by-step solution based on the provided data and fundamental principles of Riemannian geometry.\n\nThe total space is the Lie group $S^{3} \\cong \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ equipped with a bi-invariant metric $g$ of constant sectional curvature $1$. The frame $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}\\}$ is a global left-invariant orthonormal frame. For a bi-invariant metric on a Lie group, the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ for left-invariant vector fields $X, Y$ is given by the formula $\\nabla_{X}Y = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$. We will use this formula throughout the solution.\n\nThe problem specifies the vertical and horizontal distributions as $V = \\mathrm{span}\\{E_{3}\\}$ and $H = \\mathrm{span}\\{E_{1}, E_{2}\\}$. This means $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are horizontal vector fields, and $E_{3}$ is a vertical vector field. The horizontal and vertical projection operators are denoted by $h$ and $v$, respectively. For our frame, we have:\n$h(E_{1}) = E_{1}$, $v(E_{1}) = 0$\n$h(E_{2}) = E_{2}$, $v(E_{2}) = 0$\n$h(E_{3}) = 0$, $v(E_{3}) = E_{3}$\n\nThe Lie bracket relations are given as:\n$[E_{1}, E_{2}] = 2E_{3}$\n$[E_{2}, E_{3}] = 2E_{1}$\n$[E_{3}, E_{1}] = 2E_{2}$\n\nThe O'Neill tensors $A$ and $T$ are defined for any vector fields $E,F$ on $S^3$ as:\n$A_{E}F := v(\\nabla_{hE}hF) + h(\\nabla_{hE}vF)$\n$T_{E}F := h(\\nabla_{vE}vF) + v(\\nabla_{vE}hF)$\n\n**1. Computation of O'Neill Tensors $A$ and $T$**\n\nWe compute $A_{E_{1}}E_{2}$ by setting $E = E_{1}$ and $F = E_{2}$ in the definition of $A$. Since $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are horizontal fields, we have $hE_{1} = E_{1}$, $vE_{1} = 0$, $hE_{2} = E_{2}$, and $vE_{2} = 0$.\n$$A_{E_{1}}E_{2} = v(\\nabla_{hE_{1}}hE_{2}) + h(\\nabla_{hE_{1}}vE_{2})$$\n$$A_{E_{1}}E_{2} = v(\\nabla_{E_{1}}E_{2}) + h(\\nabla_{E_{1}}0)$$\nThe second term is $0$. For the first term, we use the connection formula:\n$$\\nabla_{E_{1}}E_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}[E_{1}, E_{2}] = \\frac{1}{2}(2E_{3}) = E_{3}$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$A_{E_{1}}E_{2} = v(E_{3})$$\nSince $E_{3}$ is a vertical vector field, its vertical projection is itself, $v(E_{3}) = E_{3}$.\nThus, $A_{E_{1}}E_{2} = E_{3}$.\n\nNext, we compute $T_{E_{3}}E_{3}$ by setting $E = E_{3}$ and $F = E_{3}$ in the definition of $T$. Since $E_{3}$ is a vertical field, we have $vE_{3} = E_{3}$ and $hE_{3} = 0$.\n$$T_{E_{3}}E_{3} = h(\\nabla_{vE_{3}}vE_{3}) + v(\\nabla_{vE_{3}}hE_{3})$$\n$$T_{E_{3}}E_{3} = h(\\nabla_{E_{3}}E_{3}) + v(\\nabla_{E_{3}}0)$$\nThe second term is $0$. For the first term, we have:\n$$\\nabla_{E_{3}}E_{3} = \\frac{1}{2}[E_{3}, E_{3}] = 0$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$T_{E_{3}}E_{3} = h(0) = 0$$\n\nSo, the explicit computations yield $A_{E_{1}}E_{2} = E_{3}$ and $T_{E_{3}}E_{3} = 0$.\n\n**2. Computation of Sectional Curvature in $S^{3}$**\n\nThe problem states that the total space $S^{3}$ has constant sectional curvature $K_{S^3} = 1$. As a verification, we can compute the sectional curvature of the horizontal plane $\\mathrm{span}\\{E_{1}, E_{2}\\}$ from the Lie algebra data. For a bi-invariant metric, the Riemann curvature tensor is given by $R(X,Y)Z = -\\frac{1}{4}[[X,Y],Z]$. The sectional curvature for an orthonormal pair of vectors $X,Y$ is $K(X,Y) = \\langle R(X,Y)Y, X \\rangle$.\nFor the orthonormal pair $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}\\}$, we have:\n$$K(E_{1}, E_{2}) = \\langle R(E_{1}, E_{2})E_{2}, E_{1} \\rangle = \\langle -\\frac{1}{4}[[E_{1}, E_{2}], E_{2}], E_{1} \\rangle$$\nWe compute the inner bracket first:\n$$[E_{1}, E_{2}] = 2E_{3}$$\nThen the outer bracket:\n$$[[E_{1}, E_{2}], E_{2}] = [2E_{3}, E_{2}] = 2[E_{3}, E_{2}] = 2(-[E_{2}, E_{3}]) = 2(-2E_{1}) = -4E_{1}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for curvature:\n$$K(E_{1}, E_{2}) = \\langle -\\frac{1}{4}(-4E_{1}), E_{1} \\rangle = \\langle E_{1}, E_{1} \\rangle$$\nSince $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}\\}$ is an orthonormal frame, $\\langle E_{1}, E_{1} \\rangle = 1$.\nTherefore, the sectional curvature of the horizontal $2$-plane is $K(E_{1}, E_{2}) = 1$. This is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n**3. & 4. Determination of Base Curvature and Verification with O'Neill's Formula**\n\nO'Neill's fundamental equations relate the curvature of the total space to the curvature of the base space. For a Riemannian submersion, the sectional curvature $K_{base}$ of the base manifold $B$ is related to the sectional curvature $K_{total}$ of the total space $M$ by the horizontal curvature formula. For a plane in $B$ spanned by the projection of two orthonormal horizontal vectors $X, Y$ from $M$, the formula is:\n$$K_{base}(\\pi_{*}X, \\pi_{*}Y) = K_{total}(X, Y) + 3\\|A_{X}Y\\|^{2}$$\nWe apply this formula to our setting, with the orthonormal horizontal vector fields $X = E_{1}$ and $Y = E_{2}$. The base space is $S^{2}$ with the Fubini-Study metric. We wish to compute its sectional curvature $K_{S^2}$.\n\nFrom Part 2, we have the sectional curvature in the total space for the horizontal plane:\n$$K_{total}(E_{1}, E_{2}) = 1$$\nFrom Part 1, we have the O'Neill tensor component:\n$$A_{E_{1}}E_{2} = E_{3}$$\nWe compute the squared norm of this vector. Since $\\{E_1, E_2, E_3\\}$ is an orthonormal frame, $\\|E_3\\|^2 = \\langle E_3, E_3 \\rangle = 1$.\n$$\\|A_{E_{1}}E_{2}\\|^{2} = \\|E_{3}\\|^{2} = 1$$\n\nNow we substitute these values into O'Neill's horizontal curvature formula:\n$$K_{S^2}(\\pi_{*}E_{1}, \\pi_{*}E_{2}) = K_{total}(E_{1}, E_{2}) + 3\\|A_{E_{1}}E_{2}\\|^{2}$$\n$$K_{S^2}(\\pi_{*}E_{1}, \\pi_{*}E_{2}) = 1 + 3(1) = 4$$\n\nThe frame $\\{E_{1}, E_{2}\\}$ is a global frame for the horizontal distribution $H$, and all structure constants are constant. This implies that the geometry is homogeneous, and the sectional curvature of the base manifold is constant. The problem's hint that $\\mathbb{C}\\mathrm{P}^{1}$ with the Fubini-Study metric is isometric to a round $2$-sphere is consistent with this result of constant curvature. A round $2$-sphere of radius $R$ has constant sectional curvature $1/R^{2}$. Our result $K_{S^2} = 4$ corresponds to a sphere of radius $R = 1/2$.\n\nThe final task is to report the numerical value obtained for the base sectional curvature.

The differential of $\\pi$ is computed on the coordinate basis vectors $\\{\\partial_r, \\partial_\\theta, \\partial_z\\}$.\nGiven $\\pi(r,\\theta,z) = (u,v) = (r, \\theta-\\lambda z)$, the Jacobian matrix of $\\pi$ is\n$$\nJ_\\pi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThus, the differential maps the basis vectors as:\n$d\\pi(\\partial_r) = \\partial_u$, $d\\pi(\\partial_\\theta) = \\partial_v$, and $d\\pi(\\partial_z) = -\\lambda \\partial_v$.\n\nThe vertical space $\\mathcal{V} = \\ker(d\\pi)$ consists of vectors $W = a\\partial_r + b\\partial_\\theta + c\\partial_z$ such that $d\\pi(W) = 0$.\n$d\\pi(W) = a d\\pi(\\partial_r) + b d\\pi(\\partial_\\theta) + c d\\pi(\\partial_z) = a\\partial_u + (b-\\lambda c)\\partial_v$.\nFor this to be zero, we need $a=0$ and $b=\\lambda c$.\nThus, the vertical space $\\mathcal{V}_p$ at any point $p$ is spanned by the vector field $U_0 = \\lambda\\partial_\\theta + \\partial_z$.\nTo find the unit vertical vector field $U$, we normalize $U_0$ using the metric $g=dr^2+r^2d\\theta^2+dz^2$.\n$g(U_0, U_0) = g(\\lambda\\partial_\\theta + \\partial_z, \\lambda\\partial_\\theta + \\partial_z) = \\lambda^2 g(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta) + g(\\partial_z, \\partial_z) = \\lambda^2 r^2 + 1$.\nSo, the unit vertical vector field is $U = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}} (\\lambda\\partial_\\theta + \\partial_z)$.\n\nThe horizontal space $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{V}^{\\perp}$ consists of vectors $W$ such that $g(W, U_0) = 0$.\nLet $W = a\\partial_r + b\\partial_\\theta + c\\partial_z$.\n$g(W, U_0) = g(a\\partial_r + b\\partial_\\theta + c\\partial_z, \\lambda\\partial_\\theta + \\partial_z) = b\\lambda g(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta) + c g(\\partial_z, \\partial_z) = b\\lambda r^2 + c = 0$.\nA basis for $\\mathcal{H}$ can be constructed. The vector $\\partial_r$ is horizontal since for it $b=c=0$.\nFor a second basis vector, orthogonal to $\\partial_r$, we can choose a vector of the form $b\\partial_\\theta + c\\partial_z$. The condition becomes $c = -b\\lambda r^2$. We can choose $b_0 = \\partial_\\theta - \\lambda r^2 \\partial_z$.\nThe set $\\{\\partial_r, b_0\\}$ forms an orthogonal basis for $\\mathcal{H}$.\nTo get an orthonormal frame $\\{X_1, X_2\\}$, we normalize these vectors.\n$g(\\partial_r, \\partial_r) = 1$, so we choose $X_1 = \\partial_r$.\n$g(b_0,b_0) = g(\\partial_\\theta-\\lambda r^2\\partial_z, \\partial_\\theta-\\lambda r^2\\partial_z) = g(\\partial_\\theta,\\partial_\\theta) + (\\lambda r^2)^2 g(\\partial_z,\\partial_z) = r^2 + \\lambda^2 r^4 = r^2(1+\\lambda^2 r^2)$.\nSo, $X_2 = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}} (\\partial_\\theta - \\lambda r^2 \\partial_z)$.\n\nNow we verify that $d\\pi$ is an isometry from $\\mathcal{H}$ to $T_{\\pi(p)}\\mathbb{R}^2$. At a point $p=(r,\\theta,z)$, we have $\\pi(p)=(u,v)=(r, \\theta-\\lambda z)$. Note that $u=r$.\n$g(X_1, X_1) = 1$.\n$d\\pi(X_1) = d\\pi(\\partial_r) = \\partial_u$. And $h(\\partial_u, \\partial_u) = 1$. This matches.\n$g(X_2, X_2) = 1$ by construction.\n$d\\pi(X_2) = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}} d\\pi(\\partial_\\theta - \\lambda r^2 \\partial_z) = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}} (\\partial_v - \\lambda r^2 (-\\lambda \\partial_v)) = \\frac{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}{r\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}} \\partial_v = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}}{r} \\partial_v$.\n$h(d\\pi(X_2), d\\pi(X_2)) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}}{r}\\right)^2 h(\\partial_v, \\partial_v) = \\frac{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}{r^2} \\frac{u^2}{1+\\lambda^2 u^2}$.\nWith $u=r$, this becomes $\\frac{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}{r^2} \\frac{r^2}{1+\\lambda^2 r^2} = 1$. This matches.\nFinally, $g(X_1, X_2)=0$. $h(d\\pi(X_1), d\\pi(X_2)) = h(\\partial_u, \\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}}{r}\\partial_v) = 0$ since $h$ is diagonal in $(u,v)$.\nThus, $\\pi$ is a Riemannian submersion.\n\nThe frame is:\n$U = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}}(\\lambda\\partial_\\theta + \\partial_z)$,\n$X_1 = \\partial_r$,\n$X_2 = \\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2 r^2}}(\\partial_\\theta - \\lambda r^2 \\partial_z)$.\n\n**Task 2: Compute O'Neill tensors and find $\\alpha, \\beta$**\n\nWe need the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ of $g$.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the O'Neill tensor under a specific one-parameter deformation of the Riemannian metric, known as a Cheeger deformation. The primary tasks are to derive the relationship between the deformed tensor $T^{(t)}$ and the original tensor $T$, and then to interpret the result geometrically.\n\nFirst, let us determine the structure of the deformed metric $g_{t}$. The problem defines $g_t$ as the unique metric on $M$ that makes the map $\\sigma : M \\times G \\to M$, given by $\\sigma(p,h) = h \\cdot p$, a Riemannian submersion from $(M \\times G, g \\oplus t^{-1}Q)$. This construction is a non-standard but well-defined way to introduce a Cheeger-type deformation. The horizontal and vertical distributions for the action $\\pi: M \\to B$ are denoted by $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ respectively. The metric $g_t$ can be shown to preserve this decomposition, i.e., $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ remain orthogonal with respect to $g_t$. The deformation only affects the metric's restriction to these subbundles. A full derivation starting from the submersion condition on $\\sigma$ reveals that for any two tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p M$, the metric $g_t$ is given by:\n$$\ng_{t}(X,Y) = g(\\operatorname{hor}(X), \\operatorname{hor}(Y)) + \\frac{1}{t+1} g(\\operatorname{ver}(X), \\operatorname{ver}(Y))\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{hor}$ and $\\operatorname{ver}$ are the orthogonal projections onto $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ with respect to the original metric $g$. For $X, Y \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{H})$, we have $g_t(X,Y) = g(X,Y)$. For $U, V \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{V})$, we have $g_t(U,V) = \\frac{1}{t+1} g(U,V)$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to relate the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^{(t)}$ of $g_t$ to the connection $\\nabla$ of $g$. We use the Koszul formula, which defines the Levi-Civita connection uniquely. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$:\n$$\n2 g_{t}(\\nabla^{(t)}_{X} Y, Z) = X(g_{t}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{t}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{t}(X,Y)) + g_{t}([X,Y],Z) - g_{t}([X,Z],Y) - g_{t}([Y,Z],X)\n$$\nWe want to compute $T^{(t)}_{U}V = \\operatorname{hor}(\\nabla^{(t)}_{U}V)$ for vertical vector fields $U,V \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{V})$. To do this, we compute $g_{t}(\\nabla^{(t)}_{U}V, X)$ for an arbitrary horizontal vector field $X \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{H})$. With this choice of vector fields, the Koszul formula for $\\nabla^{(t)}$ simplifies significantly.\n\nLet $U,V \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{V})$ and $X \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{H})$.\n1.  Since $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ are $g_t$-orthogonal, $g_{t}(V,X) = 0$ and $g_{t}(U,X) = 0$. The first two terms of the Koszul formula vanish: $U(g_{t}(V,X)) = 0$ and $V(g_{t}(U,X)) = 0$.\n2.  The third term is $-X(g_{t}(U,V))$. Since $U,V$ are vertical, $g_{t}(U,V) = \\frac{1}{t+1} g(U,V)$. So this term becomes $-\\frac{1}{t+1} X(g(U,V))$.\n3.  The term $g_{t}([U,V],X)$ is zero. The Lie bracket of two vertical vector fields is vertical because the vertical distribution $\\mathcal{V}$ is integrable (its leaves are the orbits of the group action). Since $X$ is horizontal, $g_{t}([U,V],X) = 0$.\n4.  For the term $-g_{t}([U,X],V)$, we have $g_{t}([U,X],V) = g_{t}(\\operatorname{ver}([U,X]),V)$ because $V$ is vertical. This evaluates to $\\frac{1}{t+1} g(\\operatorname{ver}([U,X]),V) = \\frac{1}{t+1} g([U,X],V)$.\n5.  Similarly, the term $-g_{t}([V,X],U)$ becomes $-\\frac{1}{t+1} g([V,X],U)$.\n\nCombining these results, the Koszul formula for $2 g_{t}(\\nabla^{(t)}_{U}V, X)$ yields:\n$$\n2 g_{t}(\\nabla^{(t)}_{U}V, X) = -\\frac{1}{t+1} X(g(U,V)) - \\frac{1}{t+1} g([U,X],V) - \\frac{1}{t+1} g([V,X],U)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is $2 g_{t}(\\operatorname{hor}(\\nabla^{(t)}_{U}V), X) = 2 g_{t}(T^{(t)}_{U}V, X)$. Since both $T^{(t)}_{U}V$ and $X$ are horizontal, $g_{t}(T^{(t)}_{U}V, X) = g(T^{(t)}_{U}V, X)$.\nTherefore:\n$$\n2 g(T^{(t)}_{U}V, X) = \\frac{1}{t+1} \\left( -X(g(U,V)) - g([U,X],V) - g([V,X],U) \\right)\n$$\nNow, we recall the expression for the original O'Neill tensor $T$. Applying the Koszul formula for the metric $g$ to compute $2 g(\\nabla_{U}V, X) = 2 g(T_{U}V, X)$ with the same choices of vector fields $(U,V \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{V}), X \\in \\Gamma(\\mathcal{H}))$ gives:\n$$\n2 g(T_{U}V, X) = -X(g(U,V)) - g([U,X],V) - g([V,X],U)\n$$\nComparing the two expressions, we find:\n$$\n2 g(T^{(t)}_{U}V, X) = \\frac{1}{t+1} (2 g(T_{U}V, X))\n$$\nThis implies $g(T^{(t)}_{U}V, X) = g(\\frac{1}{t+1} T_{U}V, X)$. Since this equality must hold for all horizontal vector fields $X$, and since both $T^{(t)}_{U}V$ and $T_{U}V$ are horizontal vector fields by definition, we conclude that the vector fields themselves are related by:\n$$\nT^{(t)}_{U}V = \\frac{1}{t+1} T_{U}V\n$$\nThis relation holds for any pair of vertical vector fields $U,V$. As this defines the tensor, we have the closed-form expression:\n$$\nT^{(t)} = \\frac{1}{t+1} T\n$$\n\nNow we analyze this result.\nThe fibers are totally geodesic if and only if their second fundamental form vanishes identically. The tensor $T$ measures this second fundamental form. A fiber is totally geodesic if and only if $T_{U}V = 0$ for all vertical $U,V$. The statement that the fibers become \"more totally geodesic\" means that the magnitude of $T^{(t)}$ decreases.\n\nLet us consider the norm of the second fundamental form vector $T^{(t)}_{U}V$. Its norm with respect to $g_t$ is:\n$$\n\\|T^{(t)}_{U}V\\|_{g_{t}}^2 = g_{t}(T^{(t)}_{U}V, T^{(t)}_{U}V)\n$$\nSince $T^{(t)}_{U}V$ is a horizontal vector, the metric $g_t$ on it is the same as $g$:\n$$\n\\|T^{(t)}_{U}V\\|_{g_t}^2 = g(T^{(t)}_{U}V, T^{(t)}_{U}V) = g\\left(\\frac{1}{t+1} T_{U}V, \\frac{1}{t+1} T_{U}V\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{t+1}\\right)^2 g(T_{U}V, T_{U}V) = \\frac{1}{(t+1)^2} \\|T_{U}V\\|_{g}^2\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find $\\|T^{(t)}_{U}V\\|_{g_t} = \\frac{1}{t+1} \\|T_{U}V\\|_{g}$. The function $f(t) = (t+1)^{-1}$ is strictly decreasing for $t>0$. Therefore, as $t$ increases, the magnitude of the second fundamental form vector decreases. This process happens for any non-zero initial second fundamental form.\nThe precise condition under which the fibers become more totally geodesic as $t$ increases is that they are not already totally geodesic. In terms of the O'Neill tensor, this condition is $T \\neq 0$. If $T=0$, the fibers are totally geodesic, and they remain so, since $T^{(t)}=0$ for all $t$.\n\nFinally, we examine the limiting behavior as $t \\to \\infty$. As $t \\to \\infty$, the factor $\\frac{1}{t+1} \\to 0$.\nConsequently, the tensor $T^{(t)}$ approaches the zero tensor:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T^{(t)} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t+1} T = 0\n$$\nIn the limit, the O'Neill tensor vanishes, which means the fibers of the submersion $\\pi:(M, g_t) \\to (B, \\bar{g})$ become totally geodesic. This phenomenon is a key feature of Cheeger-Gromov collapsing theory, where the fibers shrink to points and their extrinsic curvature vanishes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T^{(t)} = \\frac{1}{t+1} T}$$", "id": "2989144"}]}
