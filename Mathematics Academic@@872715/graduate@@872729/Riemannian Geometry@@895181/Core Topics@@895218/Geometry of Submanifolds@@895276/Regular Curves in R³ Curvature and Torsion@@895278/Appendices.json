It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the curvature and Frenet–Serret apparatus of a straight line, defined by the parametric equation $\\gamma(t) = p + v t$, where $p, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are constant vectors and $v$ is nonzero. The analysis must be based on the fundamental definitions in terms of the arc-length parameter $s$.\n\n(a) Reparametrization by arc length and computation of curvature $\\kappa(s)$.\n\nFirst, we find the arc-length function $s(t)$. The tangent vector with respect to the parameter $t$ is the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\n\\gamma^{\\prime}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(p + v t) = v\n$$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this vector:\n$$\n\\|\\gamma^{\\prime}(t)\\| = \\|v\\|\n$$\nSince $v$ is a constant nonzero vector, the speed $\\|v\\|$ is a positive constant. Let us denote this constant by $c = \\|v\\|  0$.\n\nThe arc-length function $s(t)$, measured from $t=0$, is given by the integral of the speed:\n$$\ns(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\|\\gamma^{\\prime}(\\xi)\\| \\,d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{t} c \\,d\\xi = c t\n$$\nThus, we have the relationship $s = c t$. To reparametrize the curve by arc length, we express $t$ as a function of $s$:\n$$\nt(s) = \\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{s}{\\|v\\|}\n$$\nWe substitute this into the original equation for $\\gamma$ to obtain the arc-length parametrization, which we also denote by $\\gamma(s)$:\n$$\n\\gamma(s) = p + v \\, t(s) = p + v \\frac{s}{\\|v\\|} = p + \\left(\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right) s\n$$\nThis is the equation of the line parametrized by its arc length.\n\nNext, we compute the unit tangent vector $T(s)$, which is defined as the derivative of the arc-length-parametrized curve with respect to $s$:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{d\\gamma}{ds}(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( p + \\left(\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\\right) s \\right)\n$$\nSince $p$ and $v$ are constant vectors, the term $\\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}$ is also a constant vector. The derivative is therefore:\n$$\nT(s) = \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}\n$$\nWe observe that the unit tangent vector $T(s)$ is a constant vector; it does not change as $s$ varies. This is geometrically intuitive, as a straight line always points in the same direction.\n\nThe curvature, $\\kappa(s)$, is defined as the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\left\\| \\frac{dT}{ds}(s) \\right\\|\n$$\nSince $T(s)$ is a constant vector, its derivative with respect to $s$ is the zero vector:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{ds}(s) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|} \\right) = \\vec{0}\n$$\nTherefore, the curvature is the magnitude of the zero vector, which is zero for all $s$:\n$$\n\\kappa(s) = \\|\\vec{0}\\| = 0\n$$\nThe curvature of a straight line is identically zero, which confirms the intuition that curvature measures the failure of a curve to be a straight line.\n\n(b) The Frenet–Serret apparatus.\n\nThe Frenet–Serret frame $\\{T(s), N(s), B(s)\\}$ and the torsion $\\tau(s)$ are constructed from the derivatives of the curve. The construction begins after computing $T(s)$ and $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$.\n\nThe first Frenet–Serret equation is $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$. The principal normal vector, $N(s)$, is defined as the unit vector in the direction of $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$. Specifically, for curves where $\\kappa(s) \\neq 0$, it is given by:\n$$\nN(s) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa(s)} \\frac{dT}{ds}(s)\n$$\nAs we found in part (a), for a straight line, $\\kappa(s) = 0$ for all $s$. Consequently, the denominator in the expression for $N(s)$ is zero. Moreover, the numerator $\\frac{dT}{ds}(s)$ is also the zero vector. The expression becomes $\\frac{\\vec{0}}{0}$, which is indeterminate. The principal normal vector $N(s)$ is therefore not well-defined.\n\nGeometrically, $N(s)$ points in the direction the curve is turning. A straight line does not turn, so there is no unique direction of turning. At any point on the line, any unit vector orthogonal to the tangent vector $T$ could be chosen as a normal, but there is no canonical choice determined by the geometry of the curve itself.\n\nThe binormal vector $B(s)$ is defined by the cross product $B(s) = T(s) \\times N(s)$. Since $N(s)$ is not well-defined, $B(s)$ is also not well-defined.\n\nFinally, the torsion $\\tau(s)$ is defined via the Frenet–Serret equation $\\frac{dB}{ds}(s) = -\\tau(s) N(s)$. Since both $B(s)$ and $N(s)$ are undefined, the torsion $\\tau(s)$ is also not defined within this formal framework. The entire Frenet–Serret apparatus collapses for a curve with zero curvature.\n\nThe implication is that the concept of torsion, which measures the rate at which a curve twists out of its osculating plane (the plane spanned by $T$ and $N$), is not applicable to a straight line because a unique osculating plane does not exist. Although by convention the torsion of a straight line is taken to be $0$, this is an assignment made for consistency, not a value derived from a well-defined Frenet–Serret apparatus.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2988149"}, {"introduction": "While curvature measures a curve's bending, torsion measures its twisting out of a plane. This practice [@problem_id:2988157] provides a perfect opportunity to explore this concept by analyzing a planar curve.

Express your final answer as a single analytic expression for $\\tau(t)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the torsion $\\tau(t)$ of a given curve and a conceptual explanation for the result, based on the foundational definitions of the Frenet–Serret framework.\n\nThe curve is given by $\\gamma(t) = (a \\sin t, a \\sin t \\cos t, 0)$. The crucial observation is that the third component of $\\gamma(t)$ is identically zero for all $t$. This means the entire curve lies within the $z=0$ plane (the $xy$-plane). We will now show how this geometric fact leads to zero torsion.\n\n1.  **Tangent Vector $T(t)$**: The tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)$ is the derivative of $\\gamma(t)$. All its components will also lie in the $xy$-plane, as the derivative of the zero third component is zero.\n    $$ \\gamma'(t) = (a \\cos t, a(\\cos^2 t - \\sin^2 t), 0) = (a \\cos t, a \\cos(2t), 0) $$\n    The unit tangent vector $T(t) = \\gamma'(t)/\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|$ is a scalar multiple of $\\gamma'(t)$. Therefore, its third component is also zero: $T(t) = (T_x(t), T_y(t), 0)$.\n\n2.  **Principal Normal Vector $N(t)$**: The principal normal vector $N(t)$ is defined in the direction of the derivative of the tangent vector, $T'(t)$. Since $T(t)$ has a zero third component for all $t$, its derivative $T'(t)$ will also have a zero third component: $T'(t) = (T_x'(t), T_y'(t), 0)$.\n    The unit normal vector $N(t) = T'(t)/\\|T'(t)\\|$ is therefore also a vector in the $xy$-plane: $N(t) = (N_x(t), N_y(t), 0)$.\n\n3.  **Binormal Vector $B(t)$**: The binormal vector is defined by the cross product $B(t) = T(t) \\times N(t)$. Since both $T(t)$ and $N(t)$ lie in the $xy$-plane, their cross product must be perpendicular to this plane. Let's compute it:\n    $$ B(t) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{i}  \\mathbf{j}  \\mathbf{k} \\\\ T_x(t)  T_y(t)  0 \\\\ N_x(t)  N_y(t)  0 \\end{pmatrix} = (0, 0, T_x(t)N_y(t) - T_y(t)N_x(t)) $$\n    Since $B(t)$ must be a unit vector, its magnitude must be 1. This means $B(t)$ can only be one of two possible vectors: $(0, 0, 1)$ or $(0, 0, -1)$. On any open interval where the curvature is non-zero (so that $B(t)$ is well-defined), $B(t)$ must be a continuous function of $t$. Since it can only take discrete values, it must be a constant vector. Let's say $B(t) = B_0$, where $B_0$ is either $(0,0,1)$ or $(0,0,-1)$.\n\n4.  **Torsion $\\tau(t)$**: Torsion is defined by the Frenet–Serret equation $B'(t) = -\\tau(t) s'(t) N(t)$, where $s'(t)=\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|$ is the speed.\n    Since we established that $B(t)$ is a constant vector $B_0$, its derivative with respect to $t$ is the zero vector:\n    $$ B'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(B_0) = \\vec{0} $$\n    Substituting this into the Frenet–Serret equation gives:\n    $$ \\vec{0} = -\\tau(t) s'(t) N(t) $$\n    On the open set where the curvature is non-zero, the unit normal vector $N(t)$ is, by definition, not the zero vector. The curve is regular, so the speed $s'(t)$ is also non-zero. For the product of these three terms to be the zero vector, the scalar coefficient $\\tau(t)$ must be zero.\n    Therefore, $\\tau(t) = 0$ for all $t$ where $\\kappa(t) \\neq 0$.\n\n**Explanation**: Torsion is the geometric measure of a curve's failure to be planar. It quantifies the rate at which the osculating plane (the plane of best fit) twists as one moves along the curve. For the given lemniscate, the curve is, by construction, entirely contained within the $z=0$ plane. This means its osculating plane is always the $z=0$ plane, and thus it does not twist at all. The rate of twisting, which is the torsion, is therefore identically zero. The curvature, which measures bending *within* the plane, is generally non-zero and non-constant because the curve is neither a straight line nor a circle. A zero torsion and non-zero curvature are perfectly compatible; they describe a non-trivial curve that is confined to a plane.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2988157"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the special cases of zero curvature and zero torsion, we now turn to the general case of a curve that both bends and twists in space.

No flaws were identified.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which is divided into three parts: derivation of general formulas for curvature and torsion, application of these formulas to the given curve, and asymptotic analysis of the results.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Formulas for Curvature $\\kappa(t)$ and Torsion $\\tau(t)$**\n\nLet $\\gamma(t)$ be a regular curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The derivatives with respect to the parameter $t$ are denoted by primes, e.g., $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$. The arc length parameter is $s$, and the relationship between derivatives with respect to $t$ and $s$ is given by the chain rule: $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{ds}{dt} \\frac{d}{ds}$. The speed is $v(t) = \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|$. Thus, $\\frac{d}{ds} = \\frac{1}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|} \\frac{d}{dt}$.\n\nThe unit tangent vector is defined as $T(t) = \\frac{\\gamma'(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$.\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ is defined by the first Frenet–Serret equation, $\\frac{dT}{ds} = \\kappa N$, where $N$ is the principal normal unit vector. From this, we have $\\kappa = \\|\\frac{dT}{ds}\\|$.\nUsing the chain rule, we can express $\\frac{dT}{ds}$ in terms of $t$:\n$\\frac{dT}{ds} = \\frac{dT/dt}{ds/dt} = \\frac{T'(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$.\nTherefore, $\\kappa(t) = \\left\\| \\frac{T'(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|} \\right\\| = \\frac{\\|T'(t)\\|}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$.\n\nTo find $T'(t)$, we differentiate $T(t) = \\frac{\\gamma'(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$:\n$T'(t) = \\frac{\\gamma''(t)\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| - \\gamma'(t)\\frac{d}{dt}(\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2}$.\nThe derivative of the norm is $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma'(t) \\cdot \\gamma'(t))^{1/2} = \\frac{\\gamma'(t) \\cdot \\gamma''(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$.\nSubstituting this back gives:\n$T'(t) = \\frac{\\gamma''(t)\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 - \\gamma'(t)(\\gamma'(t) \\cdot \\gamma''(t))}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3}$.\n\nThe vector $\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)$ relates to $T'(t)$. Consider the cross product $\\gamma'(t) \\times T'(t)$:\n$\\gamma'(t) \\times T'(t) = \\gamma'(t) \\times \\left( \\frac{\\gamma''(t)\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 - \\gamma'(t)(\\gamma'(t) \\cdot \\gamma''(t))}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3} \\right)$.\nSince $\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma'(t) = 0$, the second term vanishes:\n$\\gamma'(t) \\times T'(t) = \\frac{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2(\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t))}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3} = \\frac{\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$.\nTaking the norm of both sides and noting that $\\gamma'(t) = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|T(t)$ is orthogonal to $T'(t)$ (since $\\|T(t)\\|=1$), we have $\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times T'(t)\\| = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| \\|T'(t)\\|$.\nSo, $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| \\|T'(t)\\| = \\frac{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|}$, which implies $\\|T'(t)\\| = \\frac{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\kappa(t)$:\n$\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\|T'(t)\\|}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|} = \\frac{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3}$.\n\nNext, we derive the formula for the torsion $\\tau(t)$. The binormal vector is $B = T \\times N$. The torsion is defined by the third Frenet–Serret equation, $\\frac{dB}{ds} = -\\tau N$.\nFrom the derivation for $\\kappa$, we have $\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t) = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| (\\gamma'(t) \\times T'(t)) = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 (T(t) \\times T'(t))$.\nAlso, $T'(t) = \\kappa(t) \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| N(t)$.\nSo, $\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t) = \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^2 (T(t) \\times (\\kappa(t) \\|\\gamma'(t)\\| N(t))) = \\kappa(t) \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3 (T \\times N) = \\kappa(t) \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3 B$.\nUsing our formula for $\\kappa(t)$, this simplifies to $\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t) = \\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\| B(t)$, so $B(t) = \\frac{\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|}$.\n\nThe calculation of $\\tau(t)$ is facilitated by considering the scalar triple product $(\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'') \\cdot \\gamma'''$.\nWe have $\\gamma' = vT$, $\\gamma'' = v'T + v^2\\kappa N$ (where $v = \\|\\gamma'\\|$).\nThen $\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'' = (vT) \\times (v'T+v^2\\kappa N) = v^3\\kappa(T \\times N) = v^3\\kappa B$.\nDifferentiating $\\gamma''$ gives:\n$\\gamma''' = \\frac{d}{dt}(v'T+v^2\\kappa N) = v''T + v'T' + (2vv'\\kappa+v^2\\kappa')N + v^2\\kappa N'$.\nWe only need the component along $B$ for the scalar product. Using the Frenet–Serret formulas, $T' = v\\kappa N$ and $N' = -v\\kappa T + v\\tau B$.\nThe component of $\\gamma'''$ along $B$ comes from the term $v^2 \\kappa N'$:\n$(\\gamma''')_B = v^2\\kappa(v\\tau B) = v^3\\kappa\\tau B$.\nThus, $(\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'') \\cdot \\gamma''' = (v^3\\kappa B) \\cdot \\gamma''' = (v^3\\kappa B) \\cdot (... + v^3\\kappa\\tau B) = v^6\\kappa^2\\tau$.\nWe also have $\\|\\gamma' \\times \\gamma''\\|^2 = \\|v^3\\kappa B\\|^2 = v^6\\kappa^2$.\nTherefore, $\\tau = \\frac{(\\gamma' \\times \\gamma'') \\cdot \\gamma'''}{v^6\\kappa^2} = \\frac{(\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)) \\cdot \\gamma'''(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|^2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Curve $\\gamma(t) = (t, t^2, t^3)$**\n\nWe compute the necessary derivatives of $\\gamma(t)$:\n$\\gamma'(t) = (1, 2t, 3t^2)$\n$\\gamma''(t) = (0, 2, 6t)$\n$\\gamma'''(t) = (0, 0, 6)$\n\nNext, we compute the vector and scalar products:\n$\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t) = \\left| \\begin{matrix} \\mathbf{i}  \\mathbf{j}  \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1  2t  3t^2 \\\\ 0  2  6t \\end{matrix} \\right| = (12t^2 - 6t^2)\\mathbf{i} - (6t - 0)\\mathbf{j} + (2 - 0)\\mathbf{k} = (6t^2, -6t, 2)$.\n\n$(\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)) \\cdot \\gamma'''(t) = (6t^2, -6t, 2) \\cdot (0, 0, 6) = 12$.\n\nNow we compute the required norms:\n$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (2t)^2 + (3t^2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 9t^4}$.\n$\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\| = \\sqrt{(6t^2)^2 + (-6t)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36t^4 + 36t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}$.\n\nUsing the derived formulas, we find the curvature $\\kappa(t)$:\n$\\kappa(t) = \\frac{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|}{\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}}{(1 + 4t^2 + 9t^4)^{3/2}}$.\n\nFor the torsion $\\tau(t)$, we need $\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|^2 = (2\\sqrt{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1})^2 = 4(9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1)$:\n$\\tau(t) = \\frac{(\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)) \\cdot \\gamma'''(t)}{\\|\\gamma'(t) \\times \\gamma''(t)\\|^2} = \\frac{12}{4(9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1)} = \\frac{3}{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}$.\n\n**Part 3: Asymptotic Analysis as $t \\to \\infty$**\n\nWe examine the behavior of $\\kappa(t)$ and $\\tau(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$ by considering the highest power of $t$ in each part of the expressions.\n\nFor the curvature $\\kappa(t) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}}{(1 + 4t^2 + 9t^4)^{3/2}}$:\nThe numerator behaves as $2\\sqrt{9t^4} = 2(3t^2) = 6t^2$.\nThe denominator behaves as $(9t^4)^{3/2} = ((3t^2)^2)^{3/2} = (3t^2)^3 = 27t^6$.\nThus, the leading-order asymptotic behavior is:\n$\\kappa(t) \\sim \\frac{6t^2}{27t^6} = \\frac{2}{9t^4}$.\n\nFor the torsion $\\tau(t) = \\frac{3}{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}$:\nThe denominator is dominated by the term $9t^4$.\nThus, the leading-order asymptotic behavior is:\n$\\tau(t) \\sim \\frac{3}{9t^4} = \\frac{1}{3t^4}$.\n\nThe results are the exact expressions for $\\kappa(t)$ and $\\tau(t)$, and their asymptotic forms as $t \\to \\infty$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\pmatrix{\n\\frac{2\\sqrt{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}}{(1 + 4t^2 + 9t^4)^{3/2}}  \\frac{3}{9t^4 + 9t^2 + 1}  \\frac{2}{9t^4}  \\frac{1}{3t^4}\n}\n}\n$$", "id": "2988166"}]}
