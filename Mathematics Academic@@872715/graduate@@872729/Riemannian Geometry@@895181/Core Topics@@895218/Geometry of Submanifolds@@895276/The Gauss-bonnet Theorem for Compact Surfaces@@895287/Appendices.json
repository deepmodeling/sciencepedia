The definitions and premises are scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem investigates the local and global properties of the flat two-dimensional torus, $T^2$, defined as the quotient space $T^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\Lambda$ for some lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. The Riemannian metric on $T^2$ is the one induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, given in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ by $ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2$. This means the quotient map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a local isometry. A fundamental consequence of this definition is that the intrinsic Gaussian curvature of this \"flat torus\" is identically zero, $K \\equiv 0$.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of a Local Isometric Immersion**\n\nWe are asked to construct a smooth isometric immersion $\\varphi: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ for a coordinate neighborhood $U \\subset T^2$, such that the image $\\varphi(U)$ has Gaussian curvature $K=0$. The neighborhood $U$ is chosen such that its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ is an open rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nLet this open rectangle in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ be $V = (u_1, u_2) \\times (v_1, v_2)$. Since the quotient map $\\pi$ is a local isometry, the neighborhood $(U, g_U)$ is isometric to the rectangle $(V, g_{Euc})$, where $g_U$ is the metric on $U$ and $g_{Euc}$ is the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In coordinates $(u, v)$ on $V$, the metric is given by the first fundamental form $ds^2 = du^2 + dv^2$. Our task reduces to finding a smooth isometric immersion of this rectangle $V$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nA surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ has zero Gaussian curvature if and only if it is a developable surface. The simplest non-planar example of a developable surface is a right circular cylinder. Let us define a mapping $\\varphi: V \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ that wraps the rectangle onto a piece of a cylinder. For simplicity, we choose a cylinder of radius $R=1$ whose axis is the $z$-axis. Let the map be:\n$$ \\varphi(u, v) = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), v) $$\nThis map is smooth (infinitely differentiable) since its component functions are smooth. To verify that it is an isometric immersion, we must compute its first fundamental form and check that its partial derivatives are linearly independent.\n\nThe partial derivatives of $\\varphi$ with respect to the coordinates $u$ and $v$ are:\n$$ \\varphi_u = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial u} = (-\\sin(u), \\cos(u), 0) $$\n$$ \\varphi_v = \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial v} = (0, 0, 1) $$\nThe coefficients of the first fundamental form ($E$, $F$, $G$) are the inner products of these tangent vectors:\n$$ E = \\varphi_u \\cdot \\varphi_u = (-\\sin(u))^2 + (\\cos(u))^2 + 0^2 = \\sin^2(u) + \\cos^2(u) = 1 $$\n$$ F = \\varphi_u \\cdot \\varphi_v = (-\\sin(u))(0) + (\\cos(u))(0) + (0)(1) = 0 $$\n$$ G = \\varphi_v \\cdot \\varphi_v = 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 $$\nThe induced metric on the image surface $\\varphi(V)$ is therefore $ds^2 = E \\, du^2 + 2F \\, du \\, dv + G \\, dv^2 = 1 \\, du^2 + 0 + 1 \\, dv^2 = du^2 + dv^2$. This is identical to the Euclidean metric on the domain $V$. Thus, the map $\\varphi$ is an isometry.\n\nThe map is an immersion because the cross product of the partial derivatives is non-zero:\n$$ \\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i}  \\mathbf{j}  \\mathbf{k} \\\\ -\\sin(u)  \\cos(u)  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{vmatrix} = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), 0) $$\nSince $\\|\\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v\\| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(u) + \\sin^2(u)} = 1 \\neq 0$, the vectors $\\varphi_u$ and $\\varphi_v$ are linearly independent everywhere, confirming that $\\varphi$ is an immersion.\n\nFinally, we must verify that the Gaussian curvature of the image surface $\\varphi(U)$ is zero. The unit normal vector to the surface is $\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v}{\\|\\varphi_u \\times \\varphi_v\\|} = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), 0)$. The second partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\varphi_{uu} = (-\\cos(u), -\\sin(u), 0) $$\n$$ \\varphi_{uv} = (0, 0, 0) $$\n$$ \\varphi_{vv} = (0, 0, 0) $$\nThe coefficients of the second fundamental form ($L$, $M$, $N$) are the inner products of these vectors with the normal $\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$ L = \\varphi_{uu} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (-\\cos(u))(\\cos(u)) + (-\\sin(u))(\\sin(u)) + (0)(0) = -(\\cos^2(u) + \\sin^2(u)) = -1 $$\n$$ M = \\varphi_{uv} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, 0) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0 $$\n$$ N = \\varphi_{vv} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, 0) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0 $$\nThe Gaussian curvature $K$ is given by the formula $K = \\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2}$. Substituting the values we found:\n$$ K = \\frac{(-1)(0) - 0^2}{(1)(1) - 0^2} = 0 $$\nThus, the constructed map $\\varphi(u,v) = (\\cos(u), \\sin(u), v)$ is a smooth isometric immersion of a rectangular piece of the flat torus into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as a surface with zero Gaussian curvature.\n\n**Part 2: Non-existence of a Global Isometric Embedding**\n\nWe must explain why no smooth embedded isometric immersion of the entire compact flat torus $T^2$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ exists. This is a classic result in differential geometry. The argument proceeds in two stages.\n\nFirst, we argue that any compact, connected, smooth surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ must have at least one point of strictly positive Gaussian curvature. Let $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be such a surface. Since $S$ is compact, it is closed and bounded. Consider the function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(p) = \\|p\\|^2$, the squared distance from the origin. Since $S$ is compact and $f$ is continuous, $f$ must attain a maximum value at some point $p_0 \\in S$. At this point $p_0$, the surface $S$ is tangent to the sphere of radius $R = \\|p_0\\|$ centered at the origin, and $S$ lies entirely inside or on this sphere. This implies that the principal curvatures of $S$ at $p_0$, with respect to the outward-pointing normal (from the perspective of the sphere), must both be less than or equal to the curvature of the sphere, which is $1/R$. More importantly, for the surface $S$ itself, considered with its intrinsic normal, this geometric configuration means that at $p_0$, the surface bends away from the tangent plane in the same direction locally. This forces both principal curvatures $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$ to have the same sign (or be zero). Therefore, the Gaussian curvature $K(p_0) = \\kappa_1(p_0) \\kappa_2(p_0)$ must be non-negative, $K(p_0) \\ge 0$. A more rigorous theorem by van Heijenoort shows that a compact, connected surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ must have a point of strictly positive Gaussian curvature.\n\nIf there were a smooth isometric embedding of the flat torus $T^2$ into $\\mathbb{R}^3$, its image would be a compact, connected, smooth surface $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Because the embedding is isometric, the Gaussian curvature of $S$ (the extrinsic curvature) must be identical to the intrinsic curvature of the flat torus, which is $K \\equiv 0$. This contradicts the theorem that any such surface must have a point with $K > 0$.\n\nAn alternative line of reasoning that avoids directly invoking the $K>0$ theorem is as follows. Suppose a compact, connected, smoothly embedded surface $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ has Gaussian curvature $K \\equiv 0$ everywhere. The theory of developable surfaces shows that such a surface must be a \"generalized cylinder\"—a surface foliated by a family of parallel lines. However, a compact surface cannot contain a straight line, as a line is non-compact. The only way for such a surface to be compact is if it is entirely contained within a plane (i.e., it is a domain in a plane with boundary).\n\nThis leads to the second stage of the argument: justifying why the torus $T^2$ cannot be smoothly embedded in a plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is a topological impossibility. The torus and the plane have different topological properties. For instance, the genus of the torus is $g(T^2)=1$, while any subset of the plane is either planar (genus $0$) or a collection of such regions. A smooth embedding is a homeomorphism onto its image, which preserves topological properties like genus. Since $1 \\neq 0$, no such embedding is possible. Alternatively, consider a non-separating simple closed curve on the torus (e.g., a \"longitude\"). If the torus were embedded in the plane, the image of this curve would be a simple closed curve in the plane. By the Jordan Curve Theorem, this curve must separate the plane into a bounded interior and an unbounded exterior. This contradicts the fact that the original curve did not separate the torus.\n\nIn summary, a smooth isometric embedding of $T^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ would require its image to be a compact surface with $K \\equiv 0$. Geometric constraints on compact surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ imply such a surface must be planar. However, topological constraints forbid the embedding of a torus into a plane. This contradiction proves that no such global embedding exists. It is noteworthy that the Nash-Kuiper theorem allows for a $C^1$ isometric embedding, but such an embedding is highly wrinkled and not smooth ($C^2$ or higher).\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Integral**\n\nWe are asked to determine the value of $\\int_{T^2} K \\, dA$ for the flat torus.\n\nAs established, the metric on this torus is, by definition, the one induced by the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to T^2$ is a local isometry. The Gaussian curvature $K$ is an intrinsic property of the Riemannian metric, meaning it can be calculated entirely from the metric tensor components $g_{ij}$ and their derivatives in a local coordinate chart. Since the metric on $T^2$ is locally identical to the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$, its Gaussian curvature must be locally identical to that of the Euclidean plane.\n\nThe standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is flat, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its Gaussian curvature is $K_{Euc} = 0$ at every point. By local isometry, the Gaussian curvature of the flat torus $T^2$ must also be identically zero, $K_{T^2} \\equiv 0$.\n\nThe integral is therefore the integral of a function that is zero everywhere on the domain of integration:\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} K \\, dA = \\int_{T^2} 0 \\, dA\n$$\nThe integral of a zero function over any domain is zero.\n$$\n\\int_{T^2} 0 \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThis result can be verified using the global Gauss-Bonnet theorem for compact surfaces without boundary, which states:\n$$ \\int_{T^2} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi(T^2) $$\nwhere $\\chi(T^2)$ is the Euler characteristic of the torus. The Euler characteristic of a torus is $\\chi(T^2) = 0$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n$$ \\int_{T^2} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThis confirms the result obtained by direct evaluation of the integrand.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2997415"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to the sphere, the archetypal surface with constant positive curvature.

The Gaussian curvature of $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ with this metric is constant and equal to $1$.\n\nThe quantity we need to compute is the total Gaussian curvature, which is the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the entire surface:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{RP}^2} K_g\\, dA_g\n$$\nwhere $dA_g$ is the area element on $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ induced by the metric $g$.\nSince we have established that $K_g$ is constantly equal to $1$ on $\\mathbb{RP}^2$, the integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{RP}^2} 1 \\cdot dA_g = \\text{Area}(\\mathbb{RP}^2)\n$$\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the total area of the real projective plane.\n\nTo find $\\text{Area}(\\mathbb{RP}^2)$, we use the fact that $\\pi : S^2 \\to \\mathbb{RP}^2$ is a covering map of degree $2$. This means that for every point $p \\in \\mathbb{RP}^2$, its preimage $\\pi^{-1}(p)$ consists of exactly two points in $S^2$. Since $\\pi$ is also a local isometry, it preserves the area element locally. For a covering map of degree $d$ between two compact Riemannian manifolds, this local preservation of area implies a global relationship between their total areas: the area of the covering space is $d$ times the area of the base space.\n\nIn our case, the covering space is $S^2$, the base space is $\\mathbb{RP}^2$, and the degree of the cover is $d=2$. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(S^2) = 2 \\cdot \\text{Area}(\\mathbb{RP}^2)\n$$\nThe problem provides the area of the unit $2$-sphere: $\\text{Area}(S^2) = 4\\pi$. We can now solve for the area of $\\mathbb{RP}^2$:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = \\frac{\\text{Area}(S^2)}{2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{2} = 2\\pi\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for the total Gaussian curvature, we find:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{RP}^2} K_g\\, dA_g = \\text{Area}(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = 2\\pi\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part of the task is to verify this result using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ without boundary states that:\n$$\n\\int_{M} K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\, \\chi(M)\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, $dA$ is the area element, and $\\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of the manifold $M$. This theorem holds for both orientable and non-orientable surfaces.\n\nWe apply this theorem to our manifold $M = \\mathbb{RP}^2$. The left-hand side is the total Gaussian curvature, which we just computed to be $2\\pi$. The right-hand side is $2\\pi$ times the Euler characteristic of $\\mathbb{RP}^2$. The problem provides the known value $\\chi(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = 1$.\nLet's compute the right-hand side of the Gauss-Bonnet equation:\n$$\n2\\pi \\, \\chi(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = 2\\pi \\cdot 1 = 2\\pi\n$$\nOur computed value for the integral is $\\int_{\\mathbb{RP}^2} K_g\\, dA_g = 2\\pi$. The value predicted by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is $2\\pi \\, \\chi(\\mathbb{RP}^2) = 2\\pi$. Since these values are equal, the result is verified.\n\nThe final answer is the computed value of the total Gaussian curvature.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi}\n$$", "id": "2997386"}]}
