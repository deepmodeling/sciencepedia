All terms are standard and the premises are consistent. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the shape operator for a unit-speed curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and then to characterize when the curve is totally geodesic and totally umbilic.\n\nLet $\\gamma: I \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a smooth, embedded, unit-speed curve with arc-length parameter $s \\in I$. The ambient space is the Euclidean plane $(\\mathbb{R}^2, \\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle)$ with its standard flat Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$.\n\nAt each point $\\gamma(s)$, we have a positively oriented orthonormal frame $\\{T(s), N(s)\\}$, where $T(s) = \\gamma'(s)$ is the unit tangent vector and $N(s)$ is the unit normal vector. Since they form an orthonormal basis for $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, we have:\n$$ \\langle T(s), T(s) \\rangle = 1 $$\n$$ \\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 1 $$\n$$ \\langle T(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa(s)$ of the curve is defined by the relation $\\nabla_{T(s)} T(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$. The connection $\\nabla$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is flat, so for a vector field $V$ along $\\gamma$, $\\nabla_{T(s)}V(s)$ is simply the ordinary derivative of the vector components with respect to $s$, i.e., $V'(s)$.\n\nOur first goal is to find an expression for the shape operator $S_s$. The shape operator (or Weingarten map) $S_s$ is a linear map on the tangent space of the submanifold, $S_s: T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I) \\to T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$. The tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$ is a one-dimensional vector space spanned by $T(s)$. The shape operator is defined by the formula $S_s(X) = -(\\nabla_X N)^\\top$ for any $X \\in T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$, where $(\\cdot)^\\top$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$.\n\nTo determine the action of $S_s$, we only need to compute $S_s(T(s))$. We begin by analyzing the vector $\\nabla_{T(s)} N(s)$. Let us differentiate the orthogonality condition $\\langle T(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0$ with respect to the arc-length parameter $s$. Using the product rule for the connection:\n$$ \\nabla_{T(s)} \\langle T(s), N(s) \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla_{T(s)} T(s), N(s) \\rangle + \\langle T(s), \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nSubstituting the definition $\\nabla_{T(s)} T(s) = \\kappa(s) N(s)$:\n$$ \\langle \\kappa(s) N(s), N(s) \\rangle + \\langle T(s), \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nSince $N(s)$ is a unit vector, $\\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 1$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\kappa(s) + \\langle T(s), \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis gives the tangential component of $\\nabla_{T(s)} N(s)$:\n$$ \\langle T(s), \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s) \\rangle = -\\kappa(s) $$\nNext, we determine the normal component. Any vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be decomposed with respect to the basis $\\{T(s), N(s)\\}$. So we can write:\n$$ \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s) = \\langle \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s), T(s) \\rangle T(s) + \\langle \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s), N(s) \\rangle N(s) $$\nTo find the coefficient of $N(s)$, we differentiate the condition $\\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 1$:\n$$ \\nabla_{T(s)} \\langle N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 2 \\langle \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis implies that $\\langle \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s), N(s) \\rangle = 0$. Therefore, the vector $\\nabla_{T(s)} N(s)$ has no component in the normal direction $N(s)$; it is purely tangential.\nSubstituting the components back, we get:\n$$ \\nabla_{T(s)} N(s) = (-\\kappa(s)) T(s) + (0) N(s) = -\\kappa(s) T(s) $$\nThis relation, along with $\\nabla_T T = \\kappa N$, constitutes the Frenet-Serret formulas for a plane curve.\n\nNow we can apply the definition of the shape operator:\n$$ S_s(T(s)) = -\\left(\\nabla_{T(s)} N(s)\\right)^\\top $$\nSubstituting the expression we found for $\\nabla_{T(s)} N(s)$:\n$$ S_s(T(s)) = -(-\\kappa(s) T(s))^\\top = (\\kappa(s) T(s))^\\top $$\nThe vector $\\kappa(s) T(s)$ is already in the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$. The orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace containing it is the vector itself. Thus, $(\\kappa(s) T(s))^\\top = \\kappa(s) T(s)$.\nThe action of the shape operator on the basis vector $T(s)$ is:\n$$ S_s(T(s)) = \\kappa(s) T(s) $$\nSince any vector $X \\in T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$ can be written as $X = cT(s)$ for some scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the action of $S_s$ on $X$ is $S_s(X) = S_s(cT(s)) = cS_s(T(s)) = c(\\kappa(s)T(s)) = \\kappa(s)(cT(s)) = \\kappa(s)X$.\nThis means the shape operator $S_s$ is simply scalar multiplication by the curvature $\\kappa(s)$ on the tangent space. In the basis $\\{T(s)\\}$, its matrix representation is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[\\kappa(s)]$.\n\nNext, we characterize the conditions for $\\gamma(I)$ to be totally geodesic and totally umbilic.\n\nA submanifold is **totally geodesic** if its second fundamental form, $h$, is identically zero. The second fundamental form is related to the shape operator by $\\langle h(X,Y), \\xi \\rangle = g(S_\\xi(X), Y)$ for any normal vector field $\\xi$. Thus, $h=0$ if and only if all shape operators are zero. For our curve, this means $S_s = 0$ for all $s \\in I$.\nFrom $S_s(T(s)) = \\kappa(s)T(s)$, the operator $S_s$ is the zero operator if and only if $\\kappa(s) = 0$.\nTherefore, the curve $\\gamma(I)$ is totally geodesic if and only if its curvature $\\kappa(s)$ is zero for all $s \\in I$. Geometrically, a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with zero curvature is a straight line, which is a geodesic in the Euclidean plane.\n\nA submanifold is **totally umbilic** at a point if its shape operator at that point is proportional to the identity map on the tangent space. That is, $S_p = \\lambda(p) \\cdot \\mathrm{Id}_{T_pM}$ for some scalar function $\\lambda(p)$.\nFor our one-dimensional submanifold $\\gamma(I)$, the tangent space $T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$ at each point is one-dimensional. Any linear operator on a one-dimensional vector space is automatically a scalar multiple of the identity map. As we have shown, for any $X \\in T_{\\gamma(s)}\\gamma(I)$, $S_s(X) = \\kappa(s)X$. This is precisely the form $\\lambda(s) \\cdot \\mathrm{Id}$ with $\\lambda(s) = \\kappa(s)$.\nTherefore, any smooth curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a totally umbilic submanifold at every point. The property of being totally umbilic is intrinsic to being a one-dimensional submanifold and imposes no constraints on the curvature function $\\kappa(s)$.\n\nFinally, we address the relationship between total umbilicity and the constancy of $\\kappa(s)$. As established, total umbilicity is always satisfied for any curve. The condition that $\\kappa(s)$ is a constant, say $\\kappa(s) = \\kappa_0$, is a stronger condition. It specifies that the curve is a totally umbilic submanifold with *constant mean curvature*. The mean curvature for a hypersurface is the trace of the shape operator, which in this one-dimensional case is just $\\kappa(s)$. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, curves with constant curvature $\\kappa_0 \\neq 0$ are arcs of circles with radius $1/|\\kappa_0|$, and curves with constant curvature $\\kappa_0 = 0$ are straight lines. So, total umbilicity does not imply constant $\\kappa(s)$, but constant $\\kappa(s)$ describes a special class of totally umbilic curves.\n\nThe final answer requested is the closed-form expression for the shape operator. This operator acts as scalar multiplication by $\\kappa(s)$, so the function $\\kappa(s)$ completely determines it.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\kappa(s)}\n$$", "id": "3005507"}, {"introduction": "Moving from curves to higher-dimensional objects, we now explore a fundamental theorem for totally umbilic hypersurfaces residing in a space form.

Derivation of the Second Fundamental Form $B$**\n\nThe second fundamental form $B$ is a tensor of type $(0,2)$ on $\\Sigma_r$ with values in the normal bundle. It is related to the shape operator $S: T\\Sigma_r \\to T\\Sigma_r$ by the relation $\\bar{g}(B(X,Y), \\eta) = g(S(X),Y)$ for any tangent vector fields $X, Y$ on $\\Sigma_r$ and any normal vector field $\\eta$. Since $\\Sigma_r$ is a hypersurface, the normal bundle is one-dimensional, spanned by $\\nu$. We can write $B(X,Y)$ as a scalar multiple of $\\nu$. The relation simplifies to $B(X,Y) = g(S(X),Y)\\nu$.\n\nThe shape operator $S$ is defined via the Weingarten equation, which relates the ambient connection to the intrinsic and normal connections. For a tangent vector field $X$ on $\\Sigma_r$, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu = (\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu)^T + (\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu)^N\n$$\nwhere $(\\cdot)^T$ and $(\\cdot)^N$ denote projections onto the tangent and normal bundles of $\\Sigma_r$, respectively. By definition, the shape operator is $S(X) = -(\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu)^T$, and the normal connection is $\\nabla_X^\\perp \\nu = (\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu)^N$.\n\nTo compute $\\bar{\\nabla}_X \\nu$, we use Jacobi fields. Let $q \\in \\Sigma_r$ and $X_q \\in T_q\\Sigma_r$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be the minimal geodesic from $p$ to $q$ with $\\gamma(0)=p$, $\\gamma(r)=q$, and $\\gamma'(r)=\\nu(q)$. There exists a Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ satisfying the initial conditions $J(0)=0$ and $J(r)=X_q$. The vector field $\\nu$ along the geodesic is simply $\\gamma'(t)$, so $\\bar{\\nabla}_{X_q} \\nu$ at $q$ is given by the covariant derivative of the velocity field of a geodesic variation, which evaluates to the covariant derivative of the Jacobi field:\n$$\n\\bar{\\nabla}_{X_q} \\nu = \\bar{\\nabla}_{J(r)} \\gamma'(t) \\Big|_{t=r} = \\frac{D}{dt}J(t)\\Big|_{t=r} = J'(r)\n$$\nThe Jacobi equation in a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$ is $J'' + K J = 0$. For $S^n$, $K=1$, so we have $J''(t) + J(t) = 0$.\nThe general solution for $J(t)$ is $J(t) = A \\cos(t) + C \\sin(t)$, where $A$ and $C$ are vectors in $T_p S^n$. The condition $J(0)=0$ implies $A=0$, so $J(t) = C \\sin(t)$.\nThe condition $J(r) = X_q$ gives $X_q = C \\sin(r)$. Since $r \\in (0, \\pi)$, $\\sin(r) \\neq 0$, so we can solve for $C$: $C = \\frac{X_q}{\\sin(r)}$.\nThus, the Jacobi field is $J(t) = \\frac{\\sin(t)}{\\sin(r)}X_q$.\nIts derivative is $J'(t) = \\frac{\\cos(t)}{\\sin(r)}X_q$.\nAt $t=r$, we have $J'(r) = \\frac{\\cos(r)}{\\sin(r)}X_q = \\cot(r) X_q$.\nTherefore, $\\bar{\\nabla}_{X_q} \\nu = \\cot(r) X_q$.

We denote the constant $-\\cot(r)$ by $\\lambda_r$.\n$$\n\\nabla_Z^\\perp(B(X,Y)) = \\nabla_Z^\\perp(\\lambda_r g(X,Y) \\nu)\n$$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for the normal connection $\\nabla^\\perp$:\n$$\n\\nabla_Z^\\perp(\\lambda_r g(X,Y) \\nu) = (Z[\\lambda_r g(X,Y)]) \\nu + \\lambda_r g(X,Y) (\\nabla_Z^\\perp \\nu)\n$$\nWe analyze each part of this expression:\n- The radius $r$ is constant over the hypersurface $\\Sigma_r$. Therefore, $\\lambda_r = -\\cot(r)$ is a constant function on $\\Sigma_r$, and its derivative along any tangent vector field $Z$ is $Z[\\lambda_r]=0$.\n- The connection $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection for the metric $g$, so it is metric-compatible, i.e., $\\nabla g=0$. This implies $Z[g(X,Y)] = g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)$.\n- Combining these, $Z[\\lambda_r g(X,Y)] = Z[\\lambda_r]g(X,Y) + \\lambda_r Z[g(X,Y)] = 0 + \\lambda_r (g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y))$.\n- As established in Part 1, $\\nabla_Z^\\perp \\nu = 0$ for any vector field $Z$ tangent to the hypersurface. This is a general property for a unit normal field on a hypersurface, as $\\bar{g}(\\nabla_Z^\\perp \\nu, \\nu) = \\frac{1}{2}Z(\\bar{g}(\\nu,\\nu)) = \\frac{1}{2}Z(1) = 0$, and $\\nabla_Z^\\perp \\nu$ must be a multiple of $\\nu$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\nabla_Z^\\perp(B(X,Y))$:\n$$\n\\nabla_Z^\\perp(B(X,Y)) = \\lambda_r (g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)) \\nu + \\lambda_r g(X,Y) (0) = \\lambda_r (g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)) \\nu\n$$\nNow we assemble the full expression for $(\\nabla_Z B)(X,Y)$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_Z B)(X,Y) = \\lambda_r (g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)) \\nu - B(\\nabla_Z X, Y) - B(X, \\nabla_Z Y)\n$$\nSubstitute the definition of $B$ in the last two terms:\n$$\nB(\\nabla_Z X, Y) = \\lambda_r g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) \\nu\n$$\n$$\nB(X, \\nabla_Z Y) = \\lambda_r g(X, \\nabla_Z Y) \\nu\n$$\nSo, the full expression becomes:\n$$\n(\\nabla_Z B)(X,Y) = \\lambda_r (g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)) \\nu - \\lambda_r g(\\nabla_Z X, Y) \\nu - \\lambda_r g(X, \\nabla_Z Y) \\nu\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla_Z B)(X,Y) = (\\lambda_r g(\\nabla_Z X, Y)\\nu + \\lambda_r g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)\\nu) - \\lambda_r g(\\nabla_Z X, Y)\\nu - \\lambda_r g(X, \\nabla_Z Y)\\nu = 0\n$$\nSince this holds for arbitrary tangent vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $\\Sigma_r$, the tensor $\\nabla B$ is identically zero.\n\n**3. Conclusion on Parallelism of $B$**\n\nA tensor is defined to be parallel if its covariant derivative is zero. Our computation in Part 2 shows that $(\\nabla_Z B)(X,Y) = 0$ for all $X,Y,Z \\in \\mathfrak{X}(\\Sigma_r)$. This means $\\nabla B = 0$.\nTherefore, the second fundamental form $B$ of the geodesic sphere $\\Sigma_r$ is parallel. This is a specific instance of a more general theorem stating that a totally umbilic hypersurface in a space of constant curvature has a parallel second fundamental form, which is a consequence of the Codazzi equation. Our explicit calculation confirms this result.\n\nThe final answer requested is the closed-form analytic expression for $\\nabla B$. As demonstrated, this is the zero tensor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3005511"}]}
