This criterion is met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound question within the field of Riemannian geometry. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Sectional Curvature\n\nThe sectional curvature of a non-degenerate plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{X, Y\\}$ is given by the formula:\n$$ K(\\sigma) = \\frac{g(R(X,Y)Y, X)}{g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)^2} $$\nwhere $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_X\\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y\\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. We consider vector fields $X$ and $Y$ that are lifts of vector fields from $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively. That is, at any point $(p_1, p_2) \\in M$, $X_{(p_1,p_2)} = (X_{1,p_1}, 0)$ and $Y_{(p_1,p_2)} = (0, Y_{2,p_2})$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of such fields.\nThe product metric $g$ is defined as $g(V,W) = g_1(V_1, W_1) + g_2(V_2, W_2)$ for $V=(V_1,V_2)$ and $W=(W_1,W_2)$. For our mixed fields $X=(X_1,0)$ and $Y=(0,Y_2)$, we have $g(X,Y) = g_1(X_1,0) + g_2(0,Y_2) = 0$.\n\nThe Lie bracket of $X$ and $Y$ vanishes, $[X,Y]=0$. To see this, consider local coordinates $(x^i)$ on $M_1$ and $(y^a)$ on $M_2$. $X$ can be written as $X = \\sum_i f^i(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ and $Y$ as $Y = \\sum_a h^a(y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^a}$. Since the components of $X$ do not depend on $y^a$ and the components of $Y$ do not depend on $x^i$, their partial derivatives commute, which results in $[X,Y]=0$.\n\nNext, we determine the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X Y$ using the Koszul identity for the Levi-Civita connection, which is a direct consequence of metric-compatibility and the torsion-free property:\n$$ 2g(\\nabla_U V, W) = U(g(V,W)) + V(g(U,W)) - W(g(U,V)) + g([U,V], W) - g([U,W], V) - g([V,W], U) $$\nLet $U=X$ and $V=Y$. Let $W$ be an arbitrary test vector field which is a lift from either $M_1$ or $M_2$.\n\nCase 1: $W$ is a lift from $M_1$, so $W=(W_1,0)$.\n$g(Y,W) = g_1(0, W_1) + g_2(Y_2, 0) = 0$.\n$g(X,W) = g_1(X_1, W_1)$, which is a function on $M$ that only depends on the $M_1$ coordinates.\n$g(X,Y) = 0$.\nThe Koszul formula becomes:\n$2g(\\nabla_X Y, W) = X(g(Y,W)) + Y(g(X,W)) - W(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],W) - g([X,W],Y) - g([Y,W],X)$.\n*   $X(g(Y,W)) = X(0) = 0$.\n*   $Y(g(X,W))$: As $Y$ differentiates with respect to $M_2$ coordinates and $g(X,W)$ only depends on $M_1$ coordinates, this term is $0$.\n*   $W(g(X,Y)) = W(0) = 0$.\n*   $g([X,Y],W) = g(0,W) = 0$.\n*   $[X,W]$ is a vector field on $M_1$ because both $X$ and $W$ are. So $[X,W]=([X_1,W_1],0)$. Then $g([X,W],Y)=g_1(0, [X_1,W_1]) + g_2(Y_2,0)=0$.\n*   $[Y,W]=0$ because their components depend on disjoint sets of coordinates. So $g([Y,W],X)=g(0,X)=0$.\nEvery term on the right-hand side is $0$. Thus, $g(\\nabla_X Y, W)=0$ for any field $W$ tangent to the $M_1$ factor. This implies the $M_1$ component of $\\nabla_X Y$ is zero.\n\nCase 2: $W$ is a lift from $M_2$, so $W=(0,W_2)$.\nA similar analysis shows that all terms on the right-hand side of the Koszul formula are zero. For instance, $X(g(Y,W))$ vanishes because $g(Y,W)=g_2(Y_2,W_2)$ depends only on $M_2$ coordinates. This implies $g(\\nabla_X Y, W)=0$ for any field $W$ tangent to the $M_2$ factor. The $M_2$ component of $\\nabla_X Y$ is therefore also zero.\n\nSince both components of $\\nabla_X Y$ are zero, we must have $\\nabla_X Y = 0$.\nFrom the torsion-free property, $\\nabla_X Y - \\nabla_Y X = [X,Y] = 0$, so $\\nabla_X Y = \\nabla_Y X$. Thus, $\\nabla_Y X = 0$ as well.\n\nNow we compute the curvature term $R(X,Y)Y$:\n$$ R(X,Y)Y = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Y) - \\nabla_Y(\\nabla_X Y) - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Y $$\nWe established that $[X,Y]=0$ and $\\nabla_X Y=0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ R(X,Y)Y = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Y) - \\nabla_Y(0) - 0 = \\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Y) $$\nThe vector field $\\nabla_Y Y$ is tangent to the $M_2$ factor. This is because for any test field $W$ from the $M_1$ factor, $g(\\nabla_Y Y, W) = Y(g(Y,W)) - g(Y, \\nabla_Y W) = Y(0) - g(Y, 0) = 0$, where we used that $\\nabla_Y W=0$ (by swapping the roles of $X$ and $Y$, and $Y$ and $W$ from our earlier calculation). So, $\\nabla_Y Y$ is a vector field of the form $(0, V_2)$.\nNow we apply $\\nabla_X$ to this field. As we have shown, for any vector field $Z=(0,Z_2)$ purely tangent to the $M_2$ factor, $\\nabla_X Z=0$.\nTherefore, $\\nabla_X(\\nabla_Y Y) = 0$.\nThis means $R(X,Y)Y = 0$.\n\nFinally, the sectional curvature of the mixed plane $\\sigma = \\operatorname{span}\\{X,Y\\}$ is:\n$$ K(\\sigma) = \\frac{g(R(X,Y)Y, X)}{g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)^2} = \\frac{g(0, X)}{g(X,X)g(Y,Y)} = 0 $$\n(assuming $X$ and $Y$ are non-zero).\n\nThe sectional curvature of any mixed plane in a product manifold is identically zero.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. By applying the Koszul identity to vector fields lifted from $M_1$ and $M_2$, one finds $\\nabla_XY=\\nabla_YX=0$ and $[X,Y]=0$ for mixed fields $X=(X_1,0)$ and $Y=(0,Y_2)$. Consequently the curvature operator satisfies $R(X,Y)Y=0$, so the sectional curvature of the mixed plane $\\sigma=\\operatorname{span}\\{X,Y\\}$ is $0$. Geometrically, geodesics along the two factors commute and produce infinitesimal rectangles that close without angle defect or holonomy, reflecting flatness in directions that span different factors.**\n*   The steps of the derivation are precisely what we have established: $[X,Y]=0$, $\\nabla_XY=0$, leading to $R(X,Y)Y=0$ and thus $K(X,Y)=0$. The reasoning is sound and follows from first principles.\n*   The geometric interpretation is correct. The vanishing of the curvature tensor for a plane means that parallel transport around an infinitesimal loop in that plane induces no rotation (no holonomy). This is geometrically described as infinitesimal rectangles closing, which reflects local flatness in those mixed directions.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The sectional curvature of a mixed plane equals the arithmetic mean of the sectional curvatures coming from $M_1$ and $M_2$ because curvature adds linearly under products; geometrically, the product bends as the average of its constituent curvatures.**\n*   This statement is factually incorrect. The sectional curvature of a mixed plane is always $0$, not a function of the curvatures of the factor manifolds (unless they happen to be $0$). Curvature does not add linearly or average in this way for product manifolds.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Mixed planes have strictly negative sectional curvature unless both $(M_1,g_1)$ and $(M_2,g_2)$ are flat, because directions from different factors diverge and produce hyperbolic behavior; geometrically, geodesics in orthogonal factors pull apart, creating negative curvature.**\n*   This statement is factually incorrect. The sectional curvature is $0$, not strictly negative. For example, the product of two spheres $S^2 \\times S^2$ everywhere has positive sectional curvature for planes tangent to the factors, but zero sectional curvature for all mixed planes. The geometric intuition presented is misleading for product manifolds.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The sectional curvature in mixed planes vanishes only at points where both factors are locally symmetric spaces, since symmetry forces cancellation of curvature contributions; geometrically, the product is flat in mixed directions precisely at symmetric points.**\n*   This statement imposes a completely unnecessary and false condition. The sectional curvature of mixed planes is zero for *any* product manifold, regardless of whether the factors are locally symmetric. The property $\\nabla R = 0$ for symmetric spaces is not relevant to this calculation.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2977661"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of simple product spaces, we now investigate how curvature emerges when the factors are coupled in a more complex way.

This ratio is constant.\nThe sectional curvature is $K_{\\text{warp}}(\\sigma) = -\\lambda^2$.\n\n**Geodesic Deviation Interpretation**\n\nGeodesic deviation is described by the Jacobi equation, which governs the separation vector $J(s)$ between nearby geodesics. For a geodesic with unit tangent vector $T$, the equation simplifies for the component $h(s)$ of $J(s)$ perpendicular to $T$:\n$$h''(s) + K h(s) = 0$$\nwhere $K$ is the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by $T$ and the separation direction, and $s$ is the arc length along the geodesic. The problem specifies geodesics initially tangent to $e_r=\\partial_r$ and a separation field along $e_y$. The vector field $T=\\partial_r$ is tangent to a geodesic, and the curvature of the plane $\\sigma=\\mathrm{span}\\{e_r, e_y\\}$ is $K$.\n\nFor the **product metric**, $K_{\\text{prod}}=0$. The Jacobi equation is $h''(s)=0$. The solution is $h(s)=h(0)+h'(0)s$. This indicates that the distance between nearby geodesics grows linearly. This is the characteristic behavior in a flat (zero curvature) space like the Euclidean plane.\n\nFor the **warped product metric**, $K_{\\text{warp}}=-\\lambda^2$, which is a negative constant since $\\lambda0$. The Jacobi equation is $h''(s) - \\lambda^2 h(s)=0$. The general solution is a linear combination of $\\exp(\\lambda s)$ and $\\exp(-\\lambda s)$, or equivalently, $\\sinh(\\lambda s)$ and $\\cosh(\\lambda s)$. For geodesics starting at the same point ($h(0)=0$) with a small initial separation velocity ($h'(0) \\neq 0$), the solution is $h(s) = \\frac{h'(0)}{\\lambda}\\sinh(\\lambda s)$. For large $s$, this grows as $\\exp(\\lambda s)$. The negative sign of the curvature causes geodesics to diverge exponentially. The magnitude of the curvature, $|K| = \\lambda^2$, determines the rate of this exponential divergence. A larger $\\lambda$ implies a more strongly curved space and a more rapid separation of geodesics.

It poses a standard, non-trivial question in differential geometry. I will proceed to solve the problem by analyzing each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of a surface $S \\subset M^3$ is given by the **Gauss equation**:\n$$K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + \\det(L_p)$$\nwhere $p \\in S$, $\\sigma = T_p S$, $K^S(p)$ is the intrinsic Gauss curvature of $S$ at $p$, $K^M_p(\\sigma)$ is the sectional curvature of the ambient manifold $M$ for the tangent plane $\\sigma$, and $L_p$ is the shape operator (or Weingarten map) of $S$ at $p$ with respect to a chosen unit normal. The determinant of the shape operator is the product of the principal curvatures, $\\det(L_p) = k_1 k_2$. The second fundamental form is nonzero if and only if the shape operator is nonzero, which is true if at least one principal curvature is nonzero. The problem asks for examples where $K^S(p) \\neq K^M_p(\\sigma)$, which requires $\\det(L_p) = k_1 k_2 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe primary geometric consequences of the intrinsic curvature $K^S(p)$ are:\n1.  **Sum of angles in a geodesic triangle**: For a small geodesic triangle $\\Delta$ on $S$ enclosing a point $p$, the sum of its interior angles $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$ is given by the approximation:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\alpha_i \\approx \\pi + K^S(p) \\cdot \\text{Area}(\\Delta)$$\n    Thus, the sum is greater than, equal to, or less than $\\pi$ according as $K^S(p)$ is positive, zero, or negative.\n2.  **Circumference of a geodesic circle**: The circumference $L(s)$ of a small geodesic circle of radius $s$ centered at $p$ has the expansion:\n    $$L(s) = 2\\pi s \\left(1 - \\frac{K^S(p)}{6}s^2 + O(s^4)\\right)$$\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $M = \\mathbb{H}^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $-1$, and $S$ a horosphere.**\n\nA horosphere $S$ in hyperbolic $3$-space $\\mathbb{H}^3$ is intrinsically isometric to the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is a standard result; for instance, in the upper half-space model $\\{(x,y,z) | z  0\\}$, the planes $z = \\text{const}$ are horospheres, and the induced metric $ds^2 = (dx^2+dy^2)/z^2$ is conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric, and by a change of coordinates becomes exactly the Euclidean metric.\n-   Intrinsic curvature: $K^S(p) = 0$ for all $p \\in S$.\n-   Ambient curvature: $M = \\mathbb{H}^3$ has constant sectional curvature $K^M = -1$, so $K^M_p(\\sigma) = -1$.\n-   The curvatures differ: $K^S(p) = 0 \\neq -1 = K^M_p(\\sigma)$.\n-   Gauss equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 \\implies 0 = -1 + k_1 k_2 \\implies k_1 k_2 = 1$. A horosphere is totally umbilic, meaning $k_1 = k_2$. Therefore, $k_1^2=1$. By choosing the appropriate normal direction, we have $k_1 = k_2 = 1$. The second fundamental form is nonzero. The example fits the problem's criteria.\n-   Geometric consequence: Since $K^S(p) = 0$, for any geodesic triangle on $S$, the sum of interior angles is exactly $\\pi$. This contrasts with geodesic triangles in the ambient space $\\mathbb{H}^3$ (or on a totally geodesic surface within it), which have $K=-1$ and thus an angle sum less than $\\pi$. The statement is accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $M = \\mathbb{H}^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $-1$, and $S$ a totally geodesic plane.**\n\nA surface $S$ is totally geodesic by definition if its second fundamental form is identically zero. This implies its shape operator is zero, so $k_1=k_2=0$.\n-   The problem asks for examples \"because the second fundamental form is nonzero.\" This example explicitly violates this condition.\n-   Let's check the claims for completeness. Using the Gauss Equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 = -1 + 0 = -1$. The statement claims $K^M_p(\\sigma) = -1$ and $K^S(p) = -1$, which is correct.\n-   Geometric consequence: The statement claims that for small geodesic triangles on $S$, the sum of interior angles equals $\\pi$. This is incorrect. Since $K^S(p) = -1$, the sum of interior angles is strictly less than $\\pi$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The example does not satisfy the premise of a nonzero second fundamental form, and the stated geometric consequence is false.\n\n**C. $M = S^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $1$, and $S$ a geodesic sphere of (intrinsic) radius $r \\in (0,\\pi/2)$.**\n\nA geodesic sphere $S$ of radius $r$ in a space of constant curvature $C=1$ is a standard example.\n-   Ambient curvature: $K^M_p(\\sigma) = 1$.\n-   A geodesic sphere is totally umbilic. The principal curvatures are equal and given by $k_1 = k_2 = \\cot r$. Since $r \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\cot r \\neq 0$, so the second fundamental form is nonzero.\n-   Gauss equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 = 1 + (\\cot r)(\\cot r) = 1 + \\cot^2 r = \\csc^2 r$.\n-   Since $r \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, we have $0  \\sin r  1$, so $\\csc^2 r = 1/\\sin^2 r  1$. The curvatures differ: $K^S(p)  1 = K^M_p(\\sigma)$. The example fits the problem's criteria.\n-   Geometric consequence: The circumference of a small geodesic circle of radius $s$ is given by the expansion $L(s) = 2\\pi s (1 - \\frac{K^S(p)}{6}s^2 + o(s^2))$. Substituting $K^S(p) = \\csc^2 r$, we get $L(s) = 2\\pi s (1 - \\frac{\\csc^2 r}{6}s^2 + o(s^2))$, which matches the formula given.\n-   Comparison: A totally geodesic $S^2 \\subset S^3$ (a great sphere) has intrinsic curvature $K=1$. Its geodesic circle circumference would be $L_{geo}(s) = 2\\pi s (1 - \\frac{1}{6}s^2 + o(s^2))$. Since $\\csc^2 r  1$, the negative correction term for $S$ is larger in magnitude than for the totally geodesic sphere ($-\\frac{\\csc^2 r}{6}  -\\frac{1}{6}$). Thus, $L(s)$ is strictly smaller for small $s$. The stated consequence is accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. $M = \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with zero sectional curvature, and $S$ a standard torus of revolution.**\n\nFor $M = \\mathbb{R}^3$, the ambient sectional curvature is always zero: $K^M_p(\\sigma) = 0$.\n-   Gauss equation becomes $K^S(p) = k_1 k_2$. This is Gauss's *Theorema Egregium*. The problem asks for $K^S \\neq K^M$, which means we need $k_1 k_2 \\neq 0$.\n-   At a saddle point on the inner equator of a torus of revolution (with major radius $R$ and minor radius $r$), the two principal curvatures have opposite signs. One corresponds to the meridian circle (radius $r$) and the other to the latitudinal circle (radius $R-r$). With the standard outward normal, the principal curvatures are $k_1 = -1/r  0$ and $k_2 = 1/(R-r)  0$. The statement gives $k_1  0$ and $k_2  0$, which is just a change in labeling but correctly identifies that they have opposite signs. Thus, the product $K^S(p) = k_1 k_2  0$. Since $K^M_p(\\sigma) = 0$, the curvatures differ and the second fundamental form is nonzero. The example fits the criteria.\n-   Geometric consequence: Since $K^S(p)  0$, for sufficiently small geodesic triangles near $p$, the sum of interior angles will be less than $\\pi$. The statement is accurate.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. $M = S^{3}$ with constant sectional curvature $1$, and $S$ a totally geodesic great $2$-sphere.**\n\n-   As in option B, this is an example where the second fundamental form is zero by definition ($k_1=k_2=0$), so it does not meet the problem's central requirement. A totally geodesic surface is shaped as \"flatly\" as possible within the ambient manifold.\n-   Gauss equation: $K^S(p) = K^M_p(\\sigma) + k_1 k_2 = 1 + 0 = 1$. The intrinsic and ambient curvatures are equal.\n-   Geometric consequence: The claim that for geodesic triangles on this surface, the angle sum is greater than $\\pi$ is correct, since $K^S = 1  0$. However, the example itself is explicitly excluded by the problem's premise \"identify examples in which the ambient sectional curvature ... differs from the intrinsic Gauss curvature ... because the second fundamental form is nonzero\".\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The example does not satisfy the stated conditions of the problem.\n\nConclusion: Options A, C, and D are correct presentations of examples satisfying the problem's requirements, along with accurate geometric consequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2977668"}]}
