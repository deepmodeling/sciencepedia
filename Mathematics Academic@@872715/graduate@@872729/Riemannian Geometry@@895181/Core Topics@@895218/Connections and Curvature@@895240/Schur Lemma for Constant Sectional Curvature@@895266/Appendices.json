In particular, explain why this is consistent with Schur’s lemma for constant sectional curvature on connected manifolds of dimension $n\\ge 3$. Provide as your final answer the constant sectional curvature $k$ of $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n,g\\right)$. Your final answer must be a single real number with no units and no further explanation.", "solution": "Let $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n, g\\right)$ be the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, where $g$ is the standard Euclidean metric. We work in the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$. In these coordinates, the metric tensor is given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The inverse metric tensor is $g^{ij} = \\delta^{ij}$. The tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ at any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ has a canonical basis given by the coordinate vector fields $\\left\\{\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^n$.\n\nThe first step is to compute the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, for the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. These symbols are defined by the Koszul formula, which in coordinates is:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right) $$\nIn our case, the metric components $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ are constant throughout $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Therefore, all their partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates $x^i$ are zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} = 0 $$\nfor all indices $i, j, k, l$. Substituting these into the formula for the Christoffel symbols yields:\n$$ \\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 $$\nThus, all Christoffel symbols are identically zero for the standard Euclidean metric in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nNext, we compute the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. The definition of the Riemann tensor is $R(X, Y)Z = \\nabla_X \\nabla_Y Z - \\nabla_Y \\nabla_X Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]} Z$ for vector fields $X, Y, Z$. Its components, denoted $R^l_{ijk}$, in a coordinate basis are given by:\n$$ R^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{jk}}{\\partial x^i} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ik}}{\\partial x^j} + \\sum_{m=1}^n \\left( \\Gamma^m_{ik} \\Gamma^l_{mj} - \\Gamma^m_{jk} \\Gamma^l_{mi} \\right) $$\nSince we have established that all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero, their partial derivatives are also zero. Consequently, every term on the right-hand side of the equation for $R^l_{ijk}$ is zero:\n$$ R^l_{ijk} = 0 - 0 + \\sum_{m=1}^n (0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0) = 0 $$\nThis means all components of the Riemann curvature tensor are zero. Therefore, the Riemann curvature tensor itself is identically zero, which we write as $R=0$.\n\nNow, we compute the sectional curvature $K_p(\\sigma)$. The sectional curvature of a $2$-dimensional plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$ at a point $p$ is defined using any two linearly independent vectors $u, v$ that span $\\sigma$. A common formula uses an orthonormal basis $\\{u,v\\}$ for $\\sigma$:\n$$ K_p(\\sigma) = K(u,v) = g(R(u,v)v, u) $$\nSince the Riemann tensor $R$ is zero, $R(u,v)v=0$ for any choice of vectors $u,v$. Therefore, the sectional curvature is:\n$$ K_p(\\sigma) = g(0, u) = 0 $$\nThis result holds for any point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and any $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$. This shows that Euclidean space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n, g\\right)$ has constant sectional curvature $k=0$.\n\nWe must justify that the statement $R=0$ is equivalent to the statement that the sectional curvature is a constant $k=0$.\nThe implication $R=0 \\implies K=0$ was just demonstrated. If the Riemann tensor is zero, the sectional curvature must be zero.\nFor the converse implication, $K=0 \\implies R=0$, we start from the assumption that the sectional curvature $K_p(\\sigma)$ is zero for all points $p$ and all $2$-planes $\\sigma$. A space of constant sectional curvature $k$ is known to have a Riemann tensor of the form:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = k \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right) $$\nIn our case, the sectional curvature is constant with value $k=0$. Substituting $k=0$ into this formula gives:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = 0 \\cdot \\left( g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y \\right) = 0 $$\nThis shows that $R(X,Y)Z$ is the zero vector for all vector fields $X, Y, Z$, meaning the Riemann tensor is $R=0$. Thus, $K=0$ implies $R=0$, and the two conditions are equivalent.\n\nFinally, we consider this result in the context of Schur's lemma. Schur's lemma states that if $(M,g)$ is a connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \\ge 3$, and if the sectional curvature $K_p(\\sigma)$ at each point $p \\in M$ is isotropic (i.e., it depends only on the point $p$, not on the choice of the $2$-plane $\\sigma$ at that point, so $K_p(\\sigma) = k(p)$), then the function $k(p)$ must be a constant $k$ over all of $M$.\n\nLet's check the conditions for $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n, g\\right)$, assuming $n \\ge 3$:\n$1$. $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a connected manifold.\n$2$. The dimension is $n \\ge 3$.\n$3$. We computed that the sectional curvature is $K_p(\\sigma) = 0$ for all $p$ and all $\\sigma$. This means that at any given point $p$, the sectional curvature is independent of the choice of the $2$-plane $\\sigma$; its value is always $0$. So, the isotropy condition is satisfied with $k(p)=0$.\n\nSchur's lemma then concludes that $k(p)$ must be a global constant. Our calculation shows $k(p)=0$ for all $p$, which is indeed a constant function. Our result is therefore perfectly consistent with Schur's lemma; it is a direct verification of a case where the premise of the lemma holds, and the conclusion is explicitly shown to be true by direct calculation.\n\nThe constant sectional curvature $k$ of Euclidean space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^n,g\\right)$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2989334"}, {"introduction": "Having established the baseline case of zero curvature, we now explore the profound geometric consequences of a non-zero constant sectional curvature $k$.
