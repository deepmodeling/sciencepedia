In Euclidean space, geodesics are straight lines, and the unique minimizing geodesic between two points is the straight line segment joining them. In $M$, geodesics are the same straight lines as long as they remain in $M$; a straight-line segment is an admissible minimizing geodesic if and only if it does not pass through the removed point.\n\nLet $p=(a,0)$ with $a0$. For a point $x=(u,v)\\in M$, the straight segment from $p$ to $x$ passes through the origin if and only if $p$, $x$, and $(0,0)$ are colinear and $(0,0)$ lies between $p$ and $x$. Colinearity with $p=(a,0)$ forces $v=0$, and the condition that $(0,0)$ lies between $p$ and $x$ is equivalent to the existence of $t\\in(0,1)$ such that\n$$\np+t(x-p)=(0,0).\n$$\nWriting coordinates gives $a+t(u-a)=0$, so $t=\\frac{a}{a-u}$. The condition $t\\in(0,1)$ is equivalent to $u0$. Therefore, the straight segment from $p$ to $x$ is excluded precisely when $x$ lies on the negative $x$-axis, i.e., when $x=(u,0)$ with $u0$.\n\nFor any $x\\in M$ not on the negative $x$-axis, the unique straight segment from $p$ to $x$ does not meet the origin and hence is an admissible unique minimizing geodesic in $M$. Thus such points are not in the cut locus.\n\nFor $x=(u,0)$ with $u0$, the straight segment from $p$ to $x$ would pass through the removed point and is not available in $M$. Any path in $M$ from $p$ to such $x$ must detour around the origin. The infimum of lengths equals the Euclidean distance $|x-p|$, but this infimum is not attained by any curve in $M$. Moreover, the detour can be taken on either side of the origin (above or below), producing two distinct families of paths with equal limiting length. Hence, for points along the negative $x$-axis, a minimizing geodesic is not realized. This set of points forms the cut locus. Thus, the cut locus in $M$ is the open ray $\\{(x,0) : x  0\\}$.
