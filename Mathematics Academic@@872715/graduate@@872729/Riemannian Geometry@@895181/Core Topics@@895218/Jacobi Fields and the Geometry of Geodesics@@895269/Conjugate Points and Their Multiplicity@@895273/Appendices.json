The statement that $\\gamma(t) = p+tv$ is a geodesic in Euclidean space is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis begins with the Jacobi equation for a vector field $J$ along a geodesic $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe manifold in question is $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with its standard Euclidean metric. A fundamental property of Euclidean space is that it is flat. This means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. In any standard coordinate system for $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are all zero, which directly implies that the components of the Riemann tensor $R^l_{ijk}$ are also zero. Therefore, $R(X, Y)Z = 0$ for any vector fields $X, Y, Z$.\n\nWith $R \\equiv 0$, the Jacobi equation simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J = 0\n$$\nNext, we analyze the operator $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ in the context of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For the standard coordinate system, the covariant derivative of a vector field along a curve is simply the ordinary derivative of its components with respect to the curve parameter. Let $J(t)$ be a vector field along $\\gamma(t)$, which can be expressed as a vector-valued function $J: [0,L] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is given by $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J(t) = J'(t) = \\frac{dJ}{dt}$.\n\nConsequently, the Jacobi equation becomes the following second-order ordinary differential equation for the vector function $J(t)$:\n$$\nJ''(t) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $t$ yields the general solution for a Jacobi field in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$:\n$$\nJ(t) = At + B\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe first task is to determine all *normal* Jacobi fields. A Jacobi field $J$ is normal if it is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ for all $t \\in [0,L]$. The geodesic is given by $\\gamma(t) = p+tv$, so its velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = v$, which is a constant vector.\n\nThe normality condition is $\\langle J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$. Substituting the expressions for $J(t)$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\langle At + B, v \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\forall t \\in [0,L]\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product, this becomes:\n$$\nt \\langle A, v \\rangle + \\langle B, v \\rangle = 0\n$$\nSince this equation must hold for all $t$ in the interval $[0,L]$ (with $L0$), the polynomial in $t$ must be identically zero. This requires both of its coefficients to be zero:\n$$\n\\langle A, v \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle B, v \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis means that the constant vectors $A$ and $B$ must both be orthogonal to the direction vector $v$ of the geodesic. Let $v^{\\perp}$ denote the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by $v$. Then, the normal Jacobi fields along $\\gamma$ are precisely those of the form $J(t) = At + B$ with $A, B \\in v^{\\perp}$.\n\nThe second task is to deduce the multiplicity of a conjugate point. A point $\\gamma(t_1)$ is conjugate to a point $\\gamma(t_0)$ along $\\gamma$ (with $t_1  t_0$) if there exists a non-zero Jacobi field $J(t)$ such that $J(t_0) = 0$ and $J(t_1) = 0$. The multiplicity of the conjugate point is the dimension of the vector space of all such Jacobi fields.\n\nWe are asked for the multiplicity of a conjugate point at $t=L$ relative to $t=0$. We must find the dimension of the space of Jacobi fields $J(t)$ satisfying $J(0)=0$ and $J(L)=0$. We use the general form for a Jacobi field, $J(t) = At+B$, where $A, B$ are arbitrary constant vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n$1$. The condition $J(0)=0$:\n$$\nJ(0) = A(0) + B = B = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the vector $B$ must be the zero vector. Any Jacobi field vanishing at $t=0$ must be of the form $J(t) = At$.\n\n$2$. The condition $J(L)=0$:\n$$\nJ(L) = AL = 0\n$$\nSince the problem specifies $L  0$, this equation implies that the vector $A$ must be the zero vector, $A=0$.\n\nFor a Jacobi field to satisfy both boundary conditions, we must have $A=0$ and $B=0$. This means the only Jacobi field satisfying $J(0)=0$ and $J(L)=0$ is the trivial (zero) Jacobi field, $J(t)=0$ for all $t$.\n\nBy definition, a conjugate point requires the existence of a *non-zero* Jacobi field satisfying the boundary conditions. Since no such field exists, there are no points conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe multiplicity is the dimension of the vector space of Jacobi fields satisfying the conditions. This space is $\\{0\\}$, which contains only the zero vector. The dimension of the trivial vector space is $0$.\n\nTherefore, the multiplicity of any conjugate point at $t=L$ relative to $t=0$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2971996"}, {"introduction": "Having established that curvature is a necessary ingredient for the existence of conjugate points, we now turn to a simple yet illustrative curved space.

The multiplicity of the conjugate point is defined as the dimension of the vector space of all such Jacobi fields.\n\nThe Riemannian metric for the surface of revolution is given in coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ as $ds^{2} = dr^{2} + \\phi(r)^{2} d\\theta^{2}$. The warping function is specified as $\\phi(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r)$, with the constant $\\kappa  0$. The geodesic $\\gamma$ under consideration is a meridian, which can be parameterized by its arc length $r$ as $\\gamma(r) = (r, \\theta_0)$, where $\\theta_0$ is a constant. The tangent vector to this geodesic is $\\gamma'(r) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$. The metric component $g_{rr}=1$, so $|\\gamma'(r)| = \\sqrt{g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r})} = 1$, confirming that $r$ is the arc-length parameter.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional manifold, we analyze the Jacobi equation for a normal Jacobi field. A Jacobi field $J(r)$ normal to the geodesic $\\gamma(r)$ can be expressed as $J(r) = f(r) E(r)$, where $E(r)$ is a unit vector field normal to $\\gamma'(r)$ and parallel transported along $\\gamma$. The scalar function $f(r)$ must satisfy the Jacobi equation:\n$$f''(r) + K(r) f(r) = 0$$\nHere, $K(r)$ is the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point $\\gamma(r)$.\n\nFor a surface of revolution with the metric $ds^2 = dr^2 + \\phi(r)^2 d\\theta^2$, the Gaussian curvature is given by the formula $K(r) = -\\frac{\\phi''(r)}{\\phi(r)}$.

This implies the surface is locally isometric to a sphere of radius $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.\n\nThe Jacobi equation for the normal variation becomes a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients:\n$$ f''(r) + \\kappa f(r) = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this harmonic oscillator equation is:\n$$ f(r) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nTo find conjugate points to the origin $r=0$, we seek a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(r)$ that vanishes at $r=0$. The condition $J(0)=0$ implies $f(0)=0$. Applying this initial condition:\n$$ f(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A $$\nThus, we must have $A=0$. The Jacobi field must be of the form $f(r) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r)$. For this to be a non-trivial field, we require $B \\neq 0$.\n\nA conjugate point occurs at a value $r_c  0$ where this non-trivial Jacobi field vanishes again, i.e., $f(r_c)=0$.\n$$ f(r_c) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r_c) = 0 $$\nSince $B \\neq 0$, it must be that $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r_c) = 0$.

The multiplicity is the dimension of the space of all Jacobi fields along $\\gamma$ that vanish at both $r=0$ and $r=r_c$. A Jacobi field on a $2$-dimensional manifold can have a tangential and a normal component. A tangential Jacobi field has the form $(ar+b)\\gamma'(r)$. For this field to vanish at $r=0$ and $r=r_c  0$, we require $b=0$ and $a r_c = 0$, which implies $a=0$. Thus, only the trivial tangential Jacobi field vanishes at two distinct points. We therefore only need to consider normal Jacobi fields.\n\nThe space of normal Jacobi fields is $1$-dimensional. We found that any normal Jacobi field that vanishes at $r=0$ must correspond to a function $f(r) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\, r)$ for some constant $B$. We now check which of these fields also vanish at $r_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$:\n$$ f\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\right) = B \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\right) = B \\sin(\\pi) = 0 $$\nThis equation is satisfied for any value of the constant $B$. This signifies that the entire $1$-dimensional space of normal Jacobi fields that vanish at $r=0$ also vanishes at $r_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}$. The basis for this space of fields consists of a single non-zero field (e.g., taking $B=1$).\nConsequently, the dimension of the space of Jacobi fields vanishing at both points is $1$.

Simplification of the Jacobi Equation**\nThe geodesic $\\sigma(\\tau)$ starts at $p$ with initial velocity $tv$. By definition of the exponential map, $\\sigma(\\tau) = \\exp_p(\\tau(tv))$.

Let's denote this target subspace as $U = (P_1 v)^\\perp \\subset T_{\\sigma(1)}S^n$. Our map is effectively $L: v^\\perp \\to U$.\n\nTo compute its determinant, we choose a convenient basis. Let $\\{e_2, \\dots, e_n\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $v^\\perp$. Then, because $P_1$ is an isometry, the set $\\{P_1(e_2), \\dots, P_1(e_n)\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the image subspace $U$.\nLet's represent the map $L$ as a matrix with respect to these bases. For any basis vector $e_i \\in v^\\perp$ (where $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$):\n$$L(e_i) = \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t} P_1(e_i)$$\nThe coordinates of $L(e_i)$ in the basis $\\{P_1(e_2), \\dots, P_1(e_n)\\}$ are $(\\dots, 0, \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}, 0, \\dots)$, with the non-zero entry at the $(i-1)$-th position.\nThe matrix representation of $L$ is therefore a diagonal matrix of size $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$:\n$$[L] = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n0  \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n0  0  \\dots  \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t} I_{n-1}$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$\\det\\left(d\\exp_{p}\\big|_{t v}\\big|_{v^{\\perp}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}\\right)^{n-1}$$\n\n**5. Conjugate Points and Multiplicity**\nA point $q = \\exp_p(tv)$ is conjugate to $p$ along the geodesic $\\sigma$ if the differential of the exponential map $d\\exp_p|_{tv}$ is singular. Since the component of the differential along the geodesic direction itself is non-singular (it corresponds to a tangential Jacobi field which grows linearly), the singularity of the overall map is determined by the singularity of its restriction to the orthogonal subspace.\nThe map $d\\exp_p|_{tv}|_{v^\\perp}$ becomes singular if and only if its determinant is zero.\n$$\\det\\left(d\\exp_{p}\\big|_{t v}\\big|_{v^{\\perp}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}\\right)^{n-1} = 0$$\nFor $t0$, this condition is met when $\\sin(t)=0$, which implies $t = k\\pi$ for any positive integer $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. The points $q_k = \\exp_p(k\\pi v)$ are the conjugate points to $p$ along the geodesic ray defined by $v$.\n\nThe multiplicity of a conjugate point is the dimension of the null space (kernel) of the singular map $d\\exp_{p}\\big|_{t v}\\big|_{v^{\\perp}}$. When $t=k\\pi$, the map becomes the zero map on $v^\\perp$ since $\\frac{\\sin(k\\pi)}{k\\pi}=0$. The null space is therefore the entire domain $v^\\perp$. The dimension of this space is $n-1$.\nThus, each conjugate point $q_k$ has multiplicity $n-1$. For $S^n$, the first conjugate point at $t=\\pi$ is the antipodal point to $p$, and the second at $t=2\\pi$ is $p$ itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\sin(t)}{t}\\right)^{n-1}}$$", "id": "2971988"}]}
