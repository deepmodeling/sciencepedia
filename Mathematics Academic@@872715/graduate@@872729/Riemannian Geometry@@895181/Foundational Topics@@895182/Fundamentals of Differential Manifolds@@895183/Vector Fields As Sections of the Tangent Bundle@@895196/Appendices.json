This shows that option A is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the smoothness of the map $\\sigma$.**\nA vector field is defined as *smooth* if the section map $\\sigma: M \\to TM$ is a smooth map. In our case, the map is $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$. A map from a manifold to a product manifold is smooth if and only if each of its component functions is smooth.\n\nThe map $\\sigma(x)$ can be written in terms of its component functions, $\\sigma(x) = (g_1(x), g_2(x))$, where:\n- $g_1(x) = x$\n- $g_2(x) = |x|$\n\nWe need to check if both $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ are smooth functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. A function is smooth if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$).\n\n- The first component, $g_1(x) = x$, is a simple linear function. Its derivative is $g_1'(x) = 1$, its second derivative is $g_1''(x)=0$, and all higher derivatives are zero. Thus, $g_1(x)$ is infinitely differentiable and smooth everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- The second component, $g_2(x) = |x|$, is the absolute value function. It is defined piecewise:\n$$ g_2(x) = |x| = \\begin{cases} x  \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\ -x  \\text{if } x  0 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function is continuous everywhere. Let's examine its differentiability at $x=0$.\nThe right-hand derivative at $x=0$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h}{h} = 1 $$\nThe left-hand derivative at $x=0$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-h}{h} = -1 $$\nSince the left-hand and right-hand derivatives at $x=0$ are not equal ($1 \\neq -1$), the function $g_2(x) = |x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.\n\nBecause a function must be at least once differentiable to be considered for smoothness (infinite differentiability), the failure to be differentiable at even one point means $g_2(x)$ is not a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince one of the component functions of $\\sigma(x)$, namely $g_2(x)=|x|$, is not smooth, the map $\\sigma(x)$ itself is not a smooth map. Therefore, the vector field represented by $\\sigma$ is not a smooth vector field. This corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options.**\n- **Option C:** This statement is false. The zero vector field, represented by $\\sigma_0(x) = (x, 0)$, is a perfectly smooth vector field, as both component functions $g_1(x)=x$ and $g_2(x)=0$ are smooth. It vanishes everywhere. Similarly, the vector field $\\sigma_2(x) = (x, x^2)$ is smooth and vanishes at $x=0$. Vanishing at a point is not an obstruction to smoothness.\n- **Option D:** This statement is false. The tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is always trivial, meaning it is diffeomorphic to the product manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$. For the case $n=1$, the identification $T\\mathbb{R} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the standard and correct way to give $T\\mathbb{R}$ coordinates.\n- **Option E:** This statement is false. Injectivity is not a requirement for a section map to define a smooth vector field. For instance, consider the smooth vector field given by $\\sigma_c(x) = (x, \\cos(x))$. This map is not injective, because for example $\\sigma_c(0)=(0,1)$ and $\\sigma_c(2\\pi)=(2\\pi,1)$.

If any approximation were required, it would be specified in significant figures; here, provide the exact value.", "solution": "We begin by establishing the necessary mathematical framework. The space of quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$ is identified with $\\mathbb{R}^4$ via the basis $\\{1, i, j, k\\}$. A quaternion $q = q_0 + q_1 i + q_2 j + q_3 k$ corresponds to the vector $(q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$. The Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by $\\langle p, q \\rangle = \\mathrm{Re}(p\\bar{q})$, and the squared norm is $\\|q\\|^2 = \\langle q, q \\rangle = |q|^2 = q\\bar{q} = q_0^2 + q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2$.\n\nThe unit sphere $S^3$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is the set of points with unit norm, which corresponds to the set of unit quaternions, $S^3 = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{H} : |q|=1\\}$. This set forms a Lie group under quaternion multiplication, isomorphic to $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We denote this group by $G = S^3$. The identity element is $e=1$.\n\nThe Lie algebra of $G$, denoted $\\mathfrak{g}$, is the tangent space to $G$ at the identity, $\\mathfrak{g} = T_e G$. The tangent space to $S^3$ at a point $p \\in S^3$ is the set of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ orthogonal to the position vector $p$, i.e., $T_p S^3 = \\{ v \\in \\mathbb{H} : \\langle p, v \\rangle = 0 \\}$. For $p=e=1$, this condition becomes $\\langle 1, v \\rangle = \\mathrm{Re}(1\\bar{v}) = \\mathrm{Re}(\\bar{v}) = \\mathrm{Re}(v) = 0$. Thus, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the space of purely imaginary quaternions, $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathrm{Im}(\\mathbb{H})$.\n\n**1. Construction of the vector field $X$**\n\nFollowing the problem, we construct a left-invariant vector field. A left-invariant vector field $X$ on a Lie group $G$ is uniquely determined by its value at the identity, $X_e \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. For any other point $q \\in G$, the vector $X_q$ is obtained by left-translating $X_e$. The left-translation map by $q$ is $L_q: G \\to G$, defined by $L_q(p) = qp$. The vector $X_q$ is the pushforward of $X_e$ by $L_q$: $X_q = (dL_q)_e(X_e)$.\n\nWe choose a fixed non-zero element from the Lie algebra, for instance, $v = i \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. So we set $X_e = i$. Since $L_q$ is a linear map on $\\mathbb{H}$, its differential is the map itself, i.e., $(dL_q)_p(w) = qw$. At $p=e=1$, we have $(dL_q)_e(v) = qv$. Thus, the vector field $X$ is defined by $X_q = qi$.\n\nWe now justify that $X$ meets the required properties.\n- **$X$ is tangent to $S^3$**: We must show that for any $q \\in S^3$, the vector $X_q$ lies in the tangent space $T_q S^3$. This requires showing $X_q$ is orthogonal to the position vector $q$. Let $q = q_0 + q_1 i + q_2 j + q_3 k$. Then $X_q = qi = (q_0+q_1i+q_2j+q_3k)i = q_0i - q_1 +q_3j -q_2k$. In coordinates, $q=(q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3)$ and $X_q=(-q_1, q_0, q_3, -q_2)$. The Euclidean inner product is:\n$$ \\langle q, X_q \\rangle = q_0(-q_1) + q_1(q_0) + q_2(q_3) + q_3(-q_2) = -q_0q_1 + q_1q_0 + q_2q_3 - q_3q_2 = 0 $$\nSince $\\langle q, X_q \\rangle = 0$, $X_q$ is orthogonal to $q$ and is therefore tangent to $S^3$ at $q$.\n\n- **$X$ is smooth**: The components of the vector $X_q=(-q_1, q_0, q_3, -q_2)$ are linear functions of the coordinates of $q$, which are smooth functions on $S^3$. Therefore, $X$ is a smooth vector field.\n\n- **$X$ is nowhere vanishing**: Suppose $X_q=0$ for some $q \\in S^3$. This means $qi=0$. Since $q \\in S^3$, we have $|q|=1$, so $q$ is non-zero and invertible with inverse $q^{-1} = \\bar{q}$. Multiplying $qi=0$ on the left by $q^{-1}$ gives $q^{-1}(qi) = (q^{-1}q)i = 1 \\cdot i = i = 0$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $X_q$ is never zero.\n\n**2. Length of the vector field $X$**\n\nThe Riemannian metric on $S^3$ is the one induced by the Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The length of a tangent vector is its standard Euclidean norm. The squared length of $X_q$ is $\\|X_q\\|^2$:\n$$ \\|X_q\\|^2 = \\|qi\\|^2 = |qi|^2 $$\nThe norm of a product of quaternions is the product of their norms, so $|qi| = |q||i|$. Since $q \\in S^3$, $|q|=1$. The quaternion $i$ has norm $|i|=1$.\n$$ \\|X_q\\|^2 = |q|^2|i|^2 = 1^2 \\cdot 1^2 = 1 $$\nThe length of $X$ at every point $q$ is $\\|X_q\\| = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The vector field $X(q)=qi$ has constant unit length everywhere.\n\n**3. Integral curves of $X$**\n\nAn integral curve $\\gamma(t)$ of $X$ is a path on $S^3$ whose tangent vector at each point is given by the vector field at that point. This is expressed by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}(t) = X_{\\gamma(t)} $$\nSubstituting our vector field $X_q=qi$, we get the ODE for $\\gamma(t) \\in S^3$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = \\gamma(t)i $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE in the non-commutative algebra of quaternions. Given an initial condition $\\gamma(0) = q_0 \\in S^3$, the solution is given by right multiplication with the quaternion exponential:\n$$ \\gamma(t) = q_0 \\exp(ti) $$\nFor a pure imaginary quaternion $u$ with $u^2=-1$, the exponential is $\\exp(\\theta u) = \\cos(\\theta) + u\\sin(\\theta)$. Since $i^2=-1$, we have:\n$$ \\exp(ti) = \\cos(t) + i\\sin(t) $$\nThe solution is $\\gamma(t) = q_0(\\cos t + i\\sin t)$.\n\nWe now show that every integral curve is a closed embedded circle.\n- **Closedness**: The curve is periodic. $\\gamma(t)$ returns to its starting point when $\\exp(ti)$ returns to $1$. This happens when $t$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, since $\\cos(t)=1$ and $\\sin(t)=0$. The minimal positive period $T$ is $2\\pi$. Therefore, the integral curves are closed.\n$$ \\gamma(t+2\\pi) = q_0 \\exp((t+2\\pi)i) = q_0 \\exp(ti)\\exp(2\\pi i) = q_0\\exp(ti)(\\cos(2\\pi)+i\\sin(2\\pi)) = \\gamma(t) \\cdot 1 = \\gamma(t) $$\n- **Embedded Circle**: The curve can be written as $\\gamma(t) = q_0\\cos t + (q_0 i)\\sin t$. Let $u=q_0$ and $v=q_0 i$. As vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, their norms are $\\|u\\| = |q_0| = 1$ and $\\|v\\| = |q_0 i| = |q_0||i| = 1$. We have shown that $\\langle q, qi \\rangle = 0$, so $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal. Thus, $\\{u,v\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for a $2$-dimensional plane through the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The curve $\\gamma(t)$ traces a unit circle in this plane. The intersection of such a plane with the unit sphere $S^3$ is a great circle. A great circle is a closed curve which is trivially embedded in $S^3$.\n\n**Final Computation**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal positive period of the integral curves for the normalized vector field. In our construction, we chose $X_e = i$, which resulted in a vector field $X$ that already has unit length everywhere, $\\|X_q\\|=1$. Thus, no further normalization is required.\n\nThe integral curves of this unit-length field are given by $\\gamma(t) = q_0 \\exp(ti)$. We have already determined that the minimal positive period $T$ for these curves occurs when $\\exp(Ti)=1$, which gives $T=2\\pi$.\n\nAlternatively, since the vector field is of unit length, the parameter $t$ of the integral curve $\\gamma(t)$ is the arc length. The length of a closed integral curve is its minimal period. The integral curves are great circles of the unit sphere $S^3$. A great circle on a sphere of radius $R$ has circumference $2\\pi R$. Since $S^3$ has radius $R=1$, its great circles have length $2\\pi$. Therefore, the minimal period must be $2\\pi$.\n\nThe minimal positive period of these integral curves is $2\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi}$$", "id": "3006105"}]}
