The vector bundle $E$ is trivial, $E = U \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so any section $s$ can be written globally in terms of the constant frame fields $\\{s_{1}, s_{2}\\}$, which correspond to the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. A section $s$ can be represented by a column vector of its component functions, $f = \\begin{pmatrix} f^{1} \\\\ f^{2} \\end{pmatrix}$, such that $s = f^{1}s_{1} + f^{2}s_{2}$.\n\nThe connection $\\nabla$ is given by $\\nabla = d + A$, where $d$ is the exterior derivative and $A \\in \\Omega^{1}(U; \\operatorname{End}(\\mathbb{R}^{2}))$ is the connection $1$-form matrix. The condition for a section $s$ to be parallel, $\\nabla s = 0$, translates into a condition on its component vector $f$:\n$$\n\\nabla s = (d+A)(f) = df + A \\wedge f = df + Af = 0\n$$\nThe wedge product is implicit when a matrix of $1$-forms acts on a vector of functions (0-forms). Thus, we have the first-order system of partial differential equations $df = -Af$.\n\nWe are looking for a local frame of parallel sections $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$. A frame is a set of sections that are pointwise linearly independent. Let the component vectors of $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ with respect to the frame $\\{s_{1}, s_{2}\\}$ be arranged as the columns of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $G(x,y)$. For $\\{e_{1}, e_{2}\\}$ to be a frame, the matrix $G(x,y)$ must be invertible for all $(x,y) \\in U$, i.e., $G \\in \\operatorname{GL}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nThe condition that both $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are parallel sections is equivalent to the matrix equation:\n$$\ndG + AG = 0\n$$\nThis is a system of first-order partial differential equations for the matrix-valued function $G$. A necessary condition for the existence of a solution to this system is the integrability condition. We can derive this condition by applying the exterior derivative $d$ to the equation $dG = -AG$.\nUsing the property $d^{2} = 0$ on the left side, we get $d(dG) = 0$.\nApplying $d$ to the right side and using the product rule for exterior derivatives ($d(M \\wedge N) = dM \\wedge N + (-1)^{p} M \\wedge dN$ for a $p$-form $M$):\n$$\nd(-AG) = -(dA)G + A \\wedge (dG)\n$$\nHere, $A$ is a matrix of $1$-forms and $G$ is a matrix of $0$-forms, so the product rule simplifies. Setting the results equal:\n$$\n0 = -(dA)G + A \\wedge (dG)\n$$\nNow, substitute $dG = -AG$ into this equation:\n$$\n0 = -(dA)G + A \\wedge (-AG) = -(dA)G - (A \\wedge A)G = -(dA + A \\wedge A)G\n$$\nThe expression $F^{\\nabla} = dA + A \\wedge A$ is the curvature $2$-form of the connection. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-F^{\\nabla}G = 0\n$$\nSince $G$ is an invertible matrix (as it represents a frame), we can multiply by its inverse $G^{-1}$ from the right to obtain:\n$$\nF^{\\nabla} = 0\n$$\nThis shows that the vanishing of the curvature, $F^{\\nabla}=0$, is a necessary condition for the existence of a parallel frame. The Frobenius integrability theorem states that on a simply connected domain $U$, this condition is also sufficient. The simple-connectedness of $U$ guarantees that for any two points $p_{0}, p_{1} \\in U$, the result of parallel transporting an initial frame from $p_{0}$ to $p_{1}$ is independent of the path taken between them. This allows for a well-defined parallel frame $G(p)$ for all $p \\in U$ by choosing an initial condition $G(p_{0}) = G_{0}$ (e.g., $G_{0}=I$) and parallel transporting it everywhere.\n\nPart 2: Explicit Construction\n\nWe are given the connection $1$-form on $U = \\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\, dx + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\, dy\n$$\nLet $A_{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $A_{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So, $A = A_{x}dx$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the curvature $F^{\\nabla} = dA + A \\wedge A$ vanishes.\nThe term $dA$ is:\n$$\ndA = d(A_{x}dx + A_{y}dy) = d(A_{x}) \\wedge dx + d(A_{y}) \\wedge dy\n$$\nSince $A_{x}$ and $A_{y}$ are constant matrices, their exterior derivatives $d(A_{x})$ and $d(A_{y})$ are zero. Thus, $dA = 0$.\nThe term $A \\wedge A$ is:\n$$\nA \\wedge A = (A_{x}dx + A_{y}dy) \\wedge (A_{x}dx + A_{y}dy) = (A_{x}A_{y} - A_{y}A_{x}) dx \\wedge dy\n$$\nWe compute the matrix commutator:\n$$\nA_{x}A_{y} - A_{y}A_{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $A \\wedge A = 0$.

This implies that $G$ is a function of $x$ only, so we write $G(x,y) = G(x)$.\nEquation $(1)$ becomes an ordinary differential equation for $G(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dG}{dx} = - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} G(x)\n$$\nLet $G(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} a(x) & b(x) \\\\ c(x) & d(x) \\end{pmatrix}$.

This gives the initial values: $a(0)=1$, $b(0)=0$, $c(0)=0$, $d(0)=1$.\n\nFrom (c), $\\frac{dc}{dx}=0 \\implies c(x)$ is a constant. Using $c(0)=0$, we have $c(x)=0$ for all $x$.\nFrom (d), $\\frac{dd}{dx}=0 \\implies d(x)$ is a constant. Using $d(0)=1$, we have $d(x)=1$ for all $x$.\n\nSubstitute these results into (a) and (b):\nFrom (a), $\\frac{da}{dx} = -c(x) = 0 \\implies a(x)$ is a constant. Using $a(0)=1$, we have $a(x)=1$.\nFrom (b), $\\frac{db}{dx} = -d(x) = -1$. Integrating with respect to $x$ gives $b(x) = \\int -1 \\, dx = -x + K$ for some constant $K$.
