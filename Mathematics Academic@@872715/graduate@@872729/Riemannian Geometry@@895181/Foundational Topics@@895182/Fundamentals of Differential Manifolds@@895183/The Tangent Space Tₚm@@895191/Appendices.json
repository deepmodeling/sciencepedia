A derivation at $p$ is a linear map $v: C^{\\infty}(M) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the product rule (Leibniz rule):\n$$v(fg) = f(p)v(g) + g(p)v(f) \\quad \\forall f, g \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$$\nwhere $C^{\\infty}(M)$ is the algebra of smooth real-valued functions on $M$.\n\nFor each coordinate $x^{i}$, we define an operator $\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}$ by its action on any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}(f) := \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)$$\nThis operator is a derivation because it is linear and satisfies the Leibniz rule, inheriting these properties directly from the standard partial derivative.\n\nTo show that the set $\\left\\{\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ forms a basis for $T_{p}M$, we must prove linear independence and that it spans the space.\n- **Linear Independence**: Assume a linear combination is the zero derivation: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p} = 0$ for some coefficients $c^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying this derivation to the coordinate function $x^{j}$ for any $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ gives:\n$$0 = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}\\right)(x^{j}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c^{i} \\delta^{j}{}_{i} = c^{j}$$\nThus, $c^{j}=0$ for all $j$, proving linear independence.\n- **Spanning**: Let $v \\in T_{p}M$ be an arbitrary derivation. For any $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$, Taylor's theorem at $p$ gives $f(x) = f(p) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p)(x^{i} - p^{i}) + O((x-p)^{2})$. Any derivation $v$ annihilates constants, so $v(f(p))=0$. Applying $v$ to the expansion and using the Leibniz rule shows that $v$ annihilates terms of order $2$ and higher in $(x-p)$. Thus, $v(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) v(x^{i})$. If we define the coefficients $v^{i} := v(x^{i})$, we can write $v(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}(p) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v^{i} \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right|_{p}\\right)(f)$.

For any smooth function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$, its differential at $p$, denoted $df|_{p}$, is an element of $T_{p}^{*}M$ defined by its action on any $v \\in T_{p}M$:\n$$df|_{p}(v) = v(f)$$\nWe construct the dual basis $\\{dx^{i}|_{p}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ by taking the differentials of the coordinate functions $x^{i}$.
