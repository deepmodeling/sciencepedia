In our case, the manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the Euclidean metric $g = \\delta_{ij} dx^i \\otimes dx^j$, the orientation is standard, and the volume form is $\\mathrm{vol}_g = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$. The coframe $(dx^1, dx^2, dx^3)$ is orthonormal, which means $\\langle dx^i, dx^j \\rangle = \\delta^{ij}$.\n\n**1.a. Calculation of $*(dx^i)$**\n\nThe Hodge star of a $1$-form is a $(3-1)=2$-form. Let's determine $*(dx^1)$. Since it is a $2$-form, it can be written as a linear combination of the basis $2$-forms:\n$$*(dx^1) = c_1 (dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) + c_2 (dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) + c_3 (dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)$$\nWe use the defining property of the Hodge star with $\\beta=dx^1$ and $\\alpha$ being each of the basis $1$-forms.\n\n- Let $\\alpha = dx^1$:\n$$dx^1 \\wedge *(dx^1) = \\langle dx^1, dx^1 \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g = 1 \\cdot (dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $*(dx^1)$:\n$$dx^1 \\wedge (c_1 dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + c_2 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 + c_3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = c_1 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nComparing the two expressions, we find $c_1=1$.\n\n- Let $\\alpha = dx^2$:\n$$dx^2 \\wedge *(dx^1) = \\langle dx^2, dx^1 \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g = 0 \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}_g = 0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $*(dx^1)$:\n$$dx^2 \\wedge (1 \\cdot dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + c_2 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 + c_3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = c_2 dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 = c_2 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nThis implies $c_2=0$.\n\n- Let $\\alpha = dx^3$:\n$$dx^3 \\wedge *(dx^1) = \\langle dx^3, dx^1 \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g = 0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $*(dx^1)$:\n$$dx^3 \\wedge (1 \\cdot dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + 0 \\cdot dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 + c_3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = c_3 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 = c_3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nThis implies $c_3=0$.\n\nThus, we have found $*(dx^1) = dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$.\nThe problem has a cyclic symmetry in the indices $(1,2,3)$ because the volume form $dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$ is invariant under cyclic permutation of the indices. Applying this symmetry, we obtain:\n$$*(dx^2) = dx^3 \\wedge dx^1$$\n$$*(dx^3) = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$$\n\n**1.b. Calculation of $*(dx^i \\wedge dx^j)$**\n\nThe Hodge star of a $2$-form is a $(3-2)=1$-form. Let's determine $*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)$. It can be written as:\n$$*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = c_1 dx^1 + c_2 dx^2 + c_3 dx^3$$\nThe basis of $2$-forms is $(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3, dx^3 \\wedge dx^1, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)$. With the Euclidean metric, this basis is orthonormal. So, $\\langle dx^i \\wedge dx^j, dx^k \\wedge dx^l \\rangle = 1$ if $(k,l)$ is an even permutation of $(i,j)$, and $0$ for the pairs we will test.\n\n- Let $\\alpha = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$:\n$$(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) \\wedge *(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = \\langle dx^1 \\wedge dx^2, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g = 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{vol}_g$$\nSubstituting the expression for $*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)$:\n$$(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) \\wedge (c_1 dx^1 + c_2 dx^2 + c_3 dx^3) = c_3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nSo, $c_3=1$.\n\n- Let $\\alpha = dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$:\n$$(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) \\wedge *(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = \\langle dx^2 \\wedge dx^3, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g = 0$$\nSubstituting:\n$$(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) \\wedge (c_1 dx^1 + c_2 dx^2 + 1 \\cdot dx^3) = c_1 dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 = c_1 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nSo, $c_1=0$.\n\n- Let $\\alpha = dx^3 \\wedge dx^1$:\n$$(dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) \\wedge *(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = \\langle dx^3 \\wedge dx^1, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\rangle \\mathrm{vol}_g = 0$$\nSubstituting:\n$$(dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) \\wedge (0 \\cdot dx^1 + c_2 dx^2 + 1 \\cdot dx^3) = c_2 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 = c_2 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nSo, $c_2=0$.\n\nTherefore, $*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = dx^3$.\nBy cyclic symmetry, we also have $*(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) = dx^1$ and $*(dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) = dx^2$.\n\nThe problem asks for $*(dx^i \\wedge dx^j)$ for $1 \\le i < j \\le 3$:\n- For $(i,j)=(1,2)$: $*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = dx^3$.\n- For $(i,j)=(2,3)$: $*(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) = dx^1$.\n- For $(i,j)=(1,3)$: $*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^3) = *(-dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) = -(*(dx^3 \\wedge dx^1)) = -dx^2$.\n\n### Part 2: Generalization for an Orthonormal Coframe\n\nLet $(\\theta^1, \\theta^2, \\theta^3)$ be any local oriented orthonormal coframe on a $3$-manifold $(M,g)$. The volume form is $\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\theta^1 \\wedge \\theta^2 \\wedge \\theta^3$. The Levi-Civita symbol $\\varepsilon_{ijk}$ is defined with $\\varepsilon_{123}=+1$ and total antisymmetry.\n\nThe results from Part 1 suggest a general pattern. For $*\\theta^i$, which is a $2$-form:\n$$*\\theta^i = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j,k=1}^3 \\varepsilon_{ijk} \\theta^j \\wedge \\theta^k$$\nLet's check this for $i=1$:\n$*\\theta^1 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\varepsilon_{123} \\theta^2 \\wedge \\theta^3 + \\varepsilon_{132} \\theta^3 \\wedge \\theta^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 \\cdot \\theta^2 \\wedge \\theta^3 + (-1)(-\\theta^2 \\wedge \\theta^3)) = \\theta^2 \\wedge \\theta^3$. This matches our result. The other cases follow by symmetry.\n\nFor $*(\\theta^i \\wedge \\theta^j)$, which is a $1$-form, the results from Part 1 suggest:\n$$*(\\theta^i \\wedge \\theta^j) = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\varepsilon_{ijk} \\theta^k$$\nLet's check for $(i,j)=(1,2)$:\n$*(\\theta^1 \\wedge \\theta^2) = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\varepsilon_{12k}\\theta^k = \\varepsilon_{123}\\theta^3 = \\theta^3$. This matches.\nFor $(i,j)=(1,3)$:\n$*(\\theta^1 \\wedge \\theta^3) = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\varepsilon_{13k}\\theta^k = \\varepsilon_{132}\\theta^2 = -\\theta^2$. This also matches.\nThe formula correctly captures all signs and permutations.\n\n### Part 3: Computation and Integration\n\nWe are given the $1$-form $\\alpha = x^1 dx^1 + x^2 dx^2 + x^3 dx^3$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**3.a. Computation of $*\\alpha$**\n\nThe Hodge star operator is linear. We apply it to $\\alpha$:\n$$*\\alpha = *(x^1 dx^1 + x^2 dx^2 + x^3 dx^3)$$\nUsing the linearity of $*$ and treating the functions $x^i$ as scalars:\n$$*\\alpha = x^1 *(dx^1) + x^2 *(dx^2) + x^3 *(dx^3)$$\nSubstituting the results from Part 1:\n$$*\\alpha = x^1 (dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) + x^2 (dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) + x^3 (dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)$$\n\n**3.b. Evaluation of the integral $\\int_{S^2} *\\alpha$**\n\nWe want to evaluate the integral of the $2$-form $\\omega = *\\alpha$ over the unit sphere $S^2$, which is the boundary of the unit ball $B^3 = \\{(x^1,x^2,x^3) | (x^1)^2+(x^2)^2+(x^3)^2 \\le 1\\}$. The orientation of $S^2$ is given by the outward unit normal, which is the standard boundary orientation inherited from $B^3$.\n\nWe can use the generalized Stokes' theorem, which states that for a differential $(n-1)$-form $\\omega$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold-with-boundary $M$, we have $\\int_{\\partial M} \\omega = \\int_M d\\omega$.\nIn our case, $M=B^3$ and $\\partial M = S^2$, and $\\omega=*\\alpha$ is a $2$-form.\n$$\\int_{S^2} *\\alpha = \\int_{B^3} d(*\\alpha)$$\nFirst, we compute the exterior derivative $d(*\\alpha)$:\n$$d(*\\alpha) = d(x^1 dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 + x^2 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 + x^3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)$$\nWe compute the derivative of each term:\n$$d(x^1 dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) = (dx^1) \\wedge (dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\n$$d(x^2 dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) = (dx^2) \\wedge (dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) = dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\n$$d(x^3 dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = (dx^3) \\wedge (dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) = dx^3 \\wedge dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 = dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nSumming these terms, we get:\n$$d(*\\alpha) = (1+1+1) dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 = 3 \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{S^2} *\\alpha = \\int_{B^3} 3 \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$$\nThe term $dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$ is the volume form on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. So the integral is $3$ times the volume of the unit ball $B^3$.\nThe volume of a ball of radius $R$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. For the unit ball, $R=1$, so its volume is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\n$$\\int_{S^2} *\\alpha = 3 \\times \\mathrm{Volume}(B^3) = 3 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi = 4\\pi$$\nThe value of the integral is $4\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi}$$", "id": "3006156"}, {"introduction": "A key subtlety in the theory of integration on manifolds is the requirement of orientability for defining a global volume form.

Compute the integral\n$$\n\\int_{M_{L,w}} \\rho,\n$$\nand express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for a series of arguments and a calculation concerning the Möbius band $M_{L,w}$. We will address each part in sequence, starting with the validation of the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the well-established mathematical fields of differential geometry and Riemannian geometry. It is well-posed, providing all necessary information: the construction of the manifold $M_{L,w}$ as a quotient of the rectangle $D = [0,L] \\times [-w,w]$ with the identification $(0,y) \\sim (L,-y)$, the induced Riemannian metric $g$, and a well-defined function $f$ to be used in constructing a density $\\rho$. The problem is objective and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we will demonstrate that $M_{L,w}$ is non-orientable. An $n$-dimensional manifold is orientable if it admits an atlas of coordinate charts $\\{(U_{\\alpha}, \\phi_{\\alpha})\\}$ such that for any two overlapping charts $(U_{\\alpha}, \\phi_{\\alpha})$ and $(U_{\\beta}, \\phi_{\\beta})$, the determinant of the Jacobian of the transition map $\\phi_{\\beta} \\circ \\phi_{\\alpha}^{-1}$ is positive on the overlap $\\phi_{\\alpha}(U_{\\alpha} \\cap U_{\\beta})$.\n\nLet $\\pi: D \\to M_{L,w}$ be the quotient map. We can define an atlas for $M_{L,w}$ with two charts.\nLet $U_1 = \\pi((0,L) \\times (-w,w))$. The coordinate map is $\\phi_1^{-1}: p \\mapsto (x,y)$ where $p=\\pi(x,y)$.\nLet $V_2 = \\pi(([0, \\frac{3L}{4})) \\times (-w,w))$ and $V_3 = \\pi((\\frac{L}{4}, L]) \\times (-w,w))$. The set $U_2 = V_2 \\cup V_3$ covers the whole manifold. We define a second coordinate chart on a subset of $U_2$ that covers the identification seam. Let's consider an open set $A = \\pi((\\frac{L}{2}, L) \\times (-w,w))$ and an open set $B = \\pi([0, \\frac{L}{2}) \\times (-w,w))$. Their union, after considering the identification, covers the seam.\nLet's define a coordinate chart $\\phi_A^{-1}$ on $A$ using the coordinates $(x,y)$ from $D$.\nLet's define a coordinate chart $\\phi_B'^{-1}$ on the part of $M_{L,w}$ corresponding to $B$, but using coordinates that are compatible across the seam. For a point $p=\\pi(x,y)$ with $x \\in (\\frac{L}{2}, L)$, let its coordinates be $(x_A, y_A)=(x,y)$. The same point, viewed from the \"other side\" of the identification, corresponds to a point near $x=0$.\nThe identification is $(0,y) \\sim (L,-y)$. This suggests a coordinate transformation for charts crossing the identification line. Let's define two charts covering the seam.\nLet $U_a = \\pi( (\\frac{3L}{4}, L) \\times (-w,w) \\cup [0, \\frac{L}{4}) \\times (-w,w) )$. We can define coordinates $(x',y')$ on $U_a$. For a point $p = \\pi(x,y) \\in U_a$:\nif $x \\in [0, \\frac{L}{4})$, let $(x',y') = (x,y)$.\nif $x \\in (\\frac{3L}{4}, L)$, let $(x',y') = (x-L, -y)$. Note that $x' \\in (-\\frac{L}{4}, 0)$.\nLet $U_b = \\pi( (0,L) \\times (-w,w))$. Coordinates are $(x,y)$.\nThe overlap is $U_a \\cap U_b$, which corresponds to two disjoint regions in $D$: $(\\frac{3L}{4}, L)\\times(-w,w)$ and $(0, \\frac{L}{4})\\times(-w,w)$. Let's focus on the region where $x \\in (\\frac{3L}{4}, L)$. On this region, a point has coordinates $(x,y)$ in the $U_b$ chart and $(x-L, -y)$ in the $U_a$ chart.\nThe transition map from the $(x,y)$ coordinates to the $(x',y')$ coordinates is $\\Psi(x,y) = (x',y') = (x-L, -y)$.\nThe Jacobian matrix of this transition map is\n$$ J_{\\Psi} = \\frac{\\partial(x',y')}{\\partial(x,y)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial y'}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this Jacobian is $\\det(J_{\\Psi}) = -1$.\nSince there exists a transition map with a negative Jacobian determinant, the manifold $M_{L,w}$ is non-orientable.\nA manifold admits a globally defined, nowhere-vanishing top-degree form (a volume form) if and only if it is orientable. Since $M_{L,w}$ is a $2$-dimensional non-orientable manifold, it does not admit a nowhere-vanishing global $2$-form.\n\nNext, we define the density bundle and the Riemannian density. A $k$-form $\\omega$ has local coordinate expressions that transform according to the pullback, which involves the determinant of the Jacobian of the coordinate change. Specifically, if $\\omega = f(x) dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$ and $x=\\phi(x')$, then $\\phi^*\\omega = (f \\circ \\phi) (\\det J_{\\phi}) dx'^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx'^n$. For a global form to exist, the sign of $\\det J_{\\phi}$ must be consistent.\nA density is a section of a line bundle $|\\Lambda^n T^*M|$, the density bundle. Its local representation $s(x)$ transforms under a coordinate change $x=\\phi(x')$ according to the rule $s'(x') = | \\det J_{\\phi} | (s \\circ \\phi)(x')$. The absolute value makes this transformation rule valid even for orientation-reversing coordinate changes (where $\\det J_{\\phi} < 0$).\nGiven a Riemannian metric $g$ with components $g_{ij}$ in a local chart $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$, the Riemannian volume element is defined locally as $\\omega_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$. Under a coordinate change $x=\\phi(x')$, the metric components transform as $G' = J_{\\phi}^T G J_{\\phi}$, where $G, G'$ are the matrices of metric components. Thus $\\det(G') = (\\det J_{\\phi})^2 \\det(G)$, which implies $\\sqrt{\\det(G')} = |\\det J_{\\phi}| \\sqrt{\\det(G)}$.\nLet the local representation of the Riemannian density $\\mu_g$ be the function $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}$. In the new coordinates, this function is $\\sqrt{\\det(g'_{ij})}$. We have $\\sqrt{\\det(g'_{ij}(x'))} = |\\det J_{\\phi}| \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij}(\\phi(x')))}$. This is precisely the transformation law for a density. Therefore, the collection of local functions $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}$ for all charts in an atlas pieces together to form a globally well-defined smooth section of the density bundle $|\\Lambda^2 T^*M_{L,w}|$. This global section is the Riemannian density $\\mu_g$.\n\nNow, we verify that the function $f: M_{L,w} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is well-defined. The function is given as the descent of $f^{\\sim}(x,y) = 3 + \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}) y^2$ from the rectangle $D$. For $f$ to be well-defined on the quotient space, $f^{\\sim}$ must be constant on the equivalence classes defined by the identification. The identification is $(0,y) \\sim (L,-y)$. We check if $f^{\\sim}(0,y) = f^{\\sim}(L,-y)$ for all $y \\in [-w,w]$.\nAt $x=0$, we have\n$$ f^{\\sim}(0,y) = 3 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 0}{L}\\right) y^2 = 3 + \\cos(0) y^2 = 3 + y^2 $$\nAt $x=L$, with the $y$-coordinate flipped, we have\n$$ f^{\\sim}(L,-y) = 3 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi L}{L}\\right) (-y)^2 = 3 + \\cos(2\\pi) y^2 = 3 + (1) y^2 = 3 + y^2 $$\nSince $f^{\\sim}(0,y) = f^{\\sim}(L,-y)$, the function $f$ is well-defined on $M_{L,w}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the integral $\\int_{M_{L,w}} \\rho$, where $\\rho = f \\mu_g$. The integral of a density over a manifold can be computed by integrating its local representation over the domain of a coordinate chart (or by using a partition of unity for multiple charts). Here, the manifold $M_{L,w}$ is, up to a set of measure zero (the identified boundary), covered by the single chart $\\pi|_{(0,L)\\times(-w,w)}$. The integral over $M_{L,w}$ is thus given by the integral over the fundamental domain $D=[0,L]\\times[-w,w]$.\nThe metric $g$ is induced by the standard Euclidean metric $g_0 = dx^2 + dy^2$ on $D$. In the local coordinates $(x,y)$, the matrix of metric components is $g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The determinant is $\\det(g_{ij}) = 1$.\nThe local representation of the Riemannian density $\\mu_g$ is $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\nThe density $\\rho = f \\mu_g$ has the local representation $f^\\sim(x,y) \\cdot 1 = 3 + \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}) y^2$.\nThe integral is therefore:\n$$ \\int_{M_{L,w}} \\rho = \\int_{D} f^{\\sim}(x,y) \\, dx \\, dy = \\int_{-w}^{w} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( 3 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) y^{2} \\right) dx \\, dy $$\nWe can separate the integral using Fubini's theorem:\n$$ \\int_{M_{L,w}} \\rho = \\int_{-w}^{w} \\int_{0}^{L} 3 \\, dx \\, dy + \\int_{-w}^{w} \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) y^{2} \\, dx \\, dy $$\nThe first term is:\n$$ \\int_{-w}^{w} \\int_{0}^{L} 3 \\, dx \\, dy = \\int_{-w}^{w} [3x]_0^L \\, dy = \\int_{-w}^{w} 3L \\, dy = [3Ly]_{-w}^w = 3L(w) - 3L(-w) = 6Lw $$\nFor the second term, we first integrate with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) y^{2} \\, dx = y^2 \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx $$\n$$ = y^2 \\left[ \\frac{L}{2\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_0^L = y^2 \\left( \\frac{L}{2\\pi} (\\sin(2\\pi) - \\sin(0)) \\right) = y^2 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThe integral of the second term over the entire domain is therefore $0$.\nCombining the results, the total integral is:\n$$ \\int_{M_{L,w}} \\rho = 6Lw + 0 = 6Lw $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6Lw}\n$$", "id": "3006154"}, {"introduction": "The abstract machinery of induced metrics and volume forms finds powerful application in the study of submanifolds and variational problems.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Induced Metric and Area Formula**\n\nLet the local coordinates on $\\Omega$ be $(x^{1}, x^{2})$. The immersion into $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is given by $F(x^1, x^2) = (x^1, x^2, u(x^1, x^2))$. The tangent vectors to the surface $\\Gamma_u = F(\\Omega)$ are obtained by taking the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to the coordinates $x^1$ and $x^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^1} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x^1}{\\partial x^1}, \\frac{\\partial x^2}{\\partial x^1}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^1} \\right) = \\left( 1, 0, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^1} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^2} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x^1}{\\partial x^2}, \\frac{\\partial x^2}{\\partial x^2}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^2} \\right) = \\left( 0, 1, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe components of the induced metric tensor $g$ are given by the inner products of these tangent vectors in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which has the standard Euclidean metric $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$. Let $u_i = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^i}$.\n$$\ng_{11} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^1}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^1} \\right\\rangle = \\langle (1, 0, u_1), (1, 0, u_1) \\rangle = 1^2 + 0^2 + (u_1)^2 = 1 + (u_1)^2\n$$\n$$\ng_{12} = g_{21} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^1}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^2} \\right\\rangle = \\langle (1, 0, u_1), (0, 1, u_2) \\rangle = 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 + u_1 u_2 = u_1 u_2\n$$\n$$\ng_{22} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^2}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x^2} \\right\\rangle = \\langle (0, 1, u_2), (0, 1, u_2) \\rangle = 0^2 + 1^2 + (u_2)^2 = 1 + (u_2)^2\n$$\nIn matrix form, the metric tensor is:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{11} & g_{12} \\\\ g_{21} & g_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + (u_1)^2 & u_1 u_2 \\\\ u_1 u_2 & 1 + (u_2)^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we connect this to the expression involving the Jacobian matrix $Du$. The Jacobian of $u: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is the $1 \\times 2$ matrix $Du = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 & u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its transpose is $(Du)^T = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The product is:\n$$\n(Du)^T (Du) = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 & u_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (u_1)^2 & u_1 u_2 \\\\ u_1 u_2 & (u_2)^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAdding the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nI + (Du)^T (Du) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} (u_1)^2 & u_1 u_2 \\\\ u_1 u_2 & (u_2)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + (u_1)^2 & u_1 u_2 \\\\ u_1 u_2 & 1 + (u_2)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = g\n$$\nThis verifies the expression for the metric tensor $g$. The volume form on the surface $\\Gamma_u$ in local coordinates $(x^1, x^2)$ is $\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2$. The determinant of $g$ is:\n$$\n\\det(g) = (1 + (u_1)^2)(1 + (u_2)^2) - (u_1 u_2)^2 = 1 + (u_2)^2 + (u_1)^2 + (u_1)^2 (u_2)^2 - (u_1)^2 (u_2)^2 = 1 + (u_1)^2 + (u_2)^2\n$$\nThe area of the graph $\\Gamma_u$ over the domain $\\Omega$ is the integral of the volume form over the surface, which translates to an integral over the parameter domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = \\int_{F(\\Omega)} \\mathrm{vol}_g = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx^1 dx^2 = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sqrt{\\det(I + (Du)^T (Du))} \\, dx\n$$\nThis confirms the formula given in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Area for $u(x) = k|x|^2$**\n\nWe are given the function $u(x^1, x^2) = k((x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2)$. We first compute its partial derivatives:\n$$\nu_1 = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^1} = 2kx^1\n$$\n$$\nu_2 = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x^2} = 2kx^2\n$$\nThe integrand for the area integral is $\\sqrt{1 + (u_1)^2 + (u_2)^2}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 + (2kx^1)^2 + (2kx^2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4k^2((x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2)} = \\sqrt{1 + 4k^2|x|^2}\n$$\nThe area is the integral of this quantity over the disk $\\Omega$ of radius $R$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sqrt{1 + 4k^2|x|^2} \\, dx^1 dx^2\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we switch to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x^1 = r\\cos\\theta$, $x^2 = r\\sin\\theta$. In these coordinates, $|x|^2 = r^2$ and the area element is $dx^1 dx^2 = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$. The domain $\\Omega$ is described by $0 \\le r \\le R$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R \\sqrt{1 + 4k^2 r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nSince the integrand is independent of $\\theta$, the integration over $\\theta$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = 2\\pi \\int_0^R r \\sqrt{1 + 4k^2 r^2} \\, dr\n$$\nWe use the substitution $s = 1 + 4k^2 r^2$. Then $ds = 8k^2 r \\, dr$, so $r \\, dr = \\frac{1}{8k^2} ds$. We also change the limits of integration:\n- When $r=0$, $s = 1 + 4k^2(0)^2 = 1$.\n- When $r=R$, $s = 1 + 4k^2 R^2$.\nThis substitution is valid for $k \\ne 0$. If $k=0$, the area is simply $\\int_{\\Omega} 1 \\, dx^1 dx^2 = \\pi R^2$. For $k \\ne 0$, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = 2\\pi \\int_1^{1+4k^2 R^2} \\sqrt{s} \\left(\\frac{1}{8k^2} ds\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{8k^2} \\int_1^{1+4k^2 R^2} s^{\\frac{1}{2}} ds\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = \\frac{\\pi}{4k^2} \\left[ \\frac{s^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right]_1^{1+4k^2 R^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4k^2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\left[ s^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right]_1^{1+4k^2 R^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = \\frac{\\pi}{6k^2} \\left( (1 + 4k^2 R^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 1^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{6k^2} \\left( (1 + 4k^2 R^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the closed-form area for $k \\ne 0$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Minimal Surface Equation**\n\nWe consider the area functional $\\mathcal{A}(u; \\Omega) = \\int_{\\Omega} L(Du) \\, dx$, where the Lagrangian is $L(Du) = \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}$. We introduce a variation $u_\\varepsilon = u + \\varepsilon\\varphi$ where $\\varphi \\in C^\\infty_c(\\Omega)$. The first variation is the derivative of $\\mathcal{A}(u_\\varepsilon; \\Omega)$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$ at $\\varepsilon=0$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(u_\\varepsilon; \\Omega) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla(u+\\varepsilon\\varphi)|^2} \\, dx = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u + \\varepsilon\\nabla\\varphi|^2} \\, dx\n$$\n$|\\nabla u + \\varepsilon\\nabla\\varphi|^2 = \\langle \\nabla u + \\varepsilon\\nabla\\varphi, \\nabla u + \\varepsilon\\nabla\\varphi \\rangle = |\\nabla u|^2 + 2\\varepsilon \\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla \\varphi \\rangle + \\varepsilon^2 |\\nabla\\varphi|^2$.\nWe compute the derivative with respect to $\\varepsilon$ and then set $\\varepsilon=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} \\mathcal{A}(u_\\varepsilon; \\Omega) = \\left. \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2 + 2\\varepsilon \\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla \\varphi \\rangle + \\varepsilon^2 |\\nabla\\varphi|^2} \\, dx \\right|_{\\varepsilon=0}\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_{\\Omega} \\left. \\frac{2 \\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla \\varphi \\rangle + 2\\varepsilon |\\nabla \\varphi|^2}{2\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2 + 2\\varepsilon \\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla \\varphi \\rangle + \\varepsilon^2 |\\nabla\\varphi|^2}} \\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla \\varphi \\rangle}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}} \\, dx\n$$\nThis is the first variation. To find the Euler-Lagrange equation, we use integration by parts (the Divergence Theorem). Let $\\vec{V} = \\frac{\\nabla u}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}}$. The integral is $\\int_{\\Omega} \\langle \\vec{V}, \\nabla\\varphi \\rangle \\, dx$.\nWe use the identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\varphi \\vec{V}) = \\langle \\nabla\\varphi, \\vec{V} \\rangle + \\varphi (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V})$. Therefore, $\\langle \\vec{V}, \\nabla\\varphi \\rangle = \\nabla \\cdot (\\varphi \\vec{V}) - \\varphi (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V})$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot (\\varphi \\vec{V}) - \\varphi (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) \\right) \\, dx = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot (\\varphi \\vec{V}) \\, dx - \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) \\, dx\n$$\nBy the Divergence Theorem, $\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot (\\varphi \\vec{V}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\varphi \\vec{V} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\, dS$, where $\\vec{n}$ is the outward normal to the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. Since $\\varphi \\in C^\\infty_c(\\Omega)$, $\\varphi$ vanishes on and near the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. Thus, this boundary integral is zero.\nSo, the first variation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} \\mathcal{A}(u_\\varepsilon; \\Omega) = - \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi (\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V}) \\, dx = - \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi \\, \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\nabla u}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}} \\right) dx\n$$\nThe condition for $u$ to be a critical point of the area functional (i.e., for the first variation to be zero for all admissible $\\varphi$) is that the expression inside the integral multiplying $\\varphi$ must be identically zero. This is the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations.\nTherefore, the minimal surface equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\nabla u}{\\sqrt{1 + |\\nabla u|^2}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is the partial differential equation satisfied by a function $u$ whose graph is a minimal surface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6k^{2}} \\left( \\left(1 + 4k^{2}R^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - 1 \\right)}$$", "id": "3006168"}]}
