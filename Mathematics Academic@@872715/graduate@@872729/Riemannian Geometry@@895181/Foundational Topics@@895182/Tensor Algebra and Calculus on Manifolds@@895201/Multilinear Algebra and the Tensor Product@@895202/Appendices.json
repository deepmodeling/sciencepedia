The map $A$ is defined by the relation $g(Au,v) = S(u,v)$ for all vectors $u,v \\in T_pM$. We will work in the given basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ for $T_pM$.\n\nLet $[A]$ be the matrix representing the endomorphism $A$ with respect to this basis, such that $A(e_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 [A]^i_j e_i$. Let $[G]$ be the matrix representing the metric $g$, with entries $g_{ij} = g(e_i, e_j)$. Let $[S]$ be the matrix representing the tensor $S$, with entries $S_{ij} = S(e_i, e_j)$.\n\nThe defining equation can be expressed in components by setting $u=e_j$ and $v=e_k$:\n$$ S(e_j, e_k) = g(A(e_j), e_k) $$\nThe left side is, by definition, the component $S_{jk}$ of the tensor $S$.\n$$ S_{jk} = S(e_j, e_k) $$\nThe right side can be expanded using the component representation of $A$:\n$$ g(A(e_j), e_k) = g\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^3 [A]^i_j e_i, e_k\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 [A]^i_j g(e_i, e_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^3 [A]^i_j g_{ik} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 g_{ki} [A]^i_j $$\nThe last step holds because $g$ is a symmetric tensor, so its matrix representation $[G]$ is symmetric, $g_{ik}=g_{ki}$.

It requires the application of standard definitions and computational procedures for tensors on a Riemannian manifold. We shall proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address them in order.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Decomposition\nLet $T$ be a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n$. We seek a decomposition of the form $T = S + c\\,g$, where $S$ is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor, and $c$ is a scalar function. The conditions imposed on $S$ are that it is trace-free with respect to $g$ and $g$-orthogonal to $g$.\n\nIn component form, the decomposition is $T_{ij} = S_{ij} + c\\,g_{ij}$, which implies $S_{ij} = T_{ij} - c\\,g_{ij}$.\n\nThe first condition is that $S$ is trace-free with respect to $g$. The trace of a $(0,2)$-tensor $A$ with respect to $g$ is defined as $\\mathrm{tr}_g(A) = g^{ij}A_{ij}$, where $g^{ij}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor $g^{-1}$.\nApplying this condition to $S$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}_g(S) = g^{ij}S_{ij} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{ij}$:\n$$\ng^{ij}(T_{ij} - c\\,g_{ij}) = 0\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the contraction operator:\n$$\ng^{ij}T_{ij} - c\\,g^{ij}g_{ij} = 0\n$$\nWe recognize $g^{ij}T_{ij}$ as the trace of $T$ with respect to $g$, denoted $\\mathrm{tr}_g(T)$. The term $g^{ij}g_{ij}$ is the trace of the identity map on the tangent space. By definition, $g^{ij}g_{jk} = \\delta^i_k$, so contracting with $g_{ij}$ (or $g_{ik}$) gives:\n$$\ng^{ij}g_{ij} = \\delta^j_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} 1 = n\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the equation for $c$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}_g(T) - c\\,n = 0\n$$\nSolving for $c$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nc = \\frac{\\mathrm{tr}_g(T)}{n}\n$$\nThis uniquely determines the scalar $c$ and consequently the tensor $S = T - \\frac{\\mathrm{tr}_g(T)}{n}g$.\n\nThe second condition is that $S$ is $g$-orthogonal to $g$. The inner product on the space of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensors $\\mathrm{Sym}^2 T^*_p M$ induced by $g$ is given by $\\langle A, B \\rangle_g = g^{ik}g^{jl}A_{ij}B_{kl}$ for any two tensors $A, B \\in \\mathrm{Sym}^2 T^*_p M$. We need to show that $\\langle S, g \\rangle_g = 0$.\nLet us compute this inner product:\n$$\n\\langle S, g \\rangle_g = g^{ik}g^{jl}S_{ij}g_{kl}\n$$\nWe can first contract the pair of indices $l$ and $k$. Since $g^{jl}g_{kl} = \\delta^j_k$:\n$$\n\\langle S, g \\rangle_g = g^{ik} S_{ij} \\delta^j_k\n$$\nContracting with the Kronecker delta $\\delta^j_k$ replaces the index $j$ with $k$:\n$$\n\\langle S, g \\rangle_g = g^{ik}S_{ik}\n$$\nThis is precisely the definition of the trace of $S$ with respect to $g$, $\\mathrm{tr}_g(S)$.\n$$\n\\langle S, g \\rangle_g = \\mathrm{tr}_g(S)\n$$\nSince we constructed $S$ to be trace-free (i.e., $\\mathrm{tr}_g(S) = 0$), it follows directly that $\\langle S, g \\rangle_g = 0$. Thus, the condition of being trace-free implies the condition of being $g$-orthogonal to $g$. The decomposition is therefore unique and consistent with both stated properties.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of Traces and Components\nWe are given the metric and tensor components at point $p$ in a specific coordinate system where $n=3$:\n$$\ng_{ij}(p) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2  0  0 \\\\\n0  3  0 \\\\\n0  0  6\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\nT_{ij}(p) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4  1  2 \\\\\n1  6  3 \\\\\n2  3  5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we find the components of the inverse metric $g^{ij}$. Since $g_{ij}$ is a diagonal matrix, $g^{ij}$ is also a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the reciprocals of the diagonal entries of $g_{ij}$:\n$$\ng^{ij}(p) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1/2  0  0 \\\\\n0  1/3  0 \\\\\n0  0  1/6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the $g$-trace of $T$, $\\mathrm{tr}_g(T) = g^{ij}T_{ij}$. As $g^{ij}$ is diagonal, the sum simplifies:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}_g(T) = g^{11}T_{11} + g^{22}T_{22} + g^{33}T_{33} = \\frac{1}{2}(4) + \\frac{1}{3}(6) + \\frac{1}{6}(5) = 2 + 2 + \\frac{5}{6} = 4 + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{29}{6}\n$$\nNow, we compute the scalar $c$ using the formula derived in Part 1, with $n=3$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{\\mathrm{tr}_g(T)}{n} = \\frac{29/6}{3} = \\frac{29}{18}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the components of the traceless part $S$ using $S_{ij} = T_{ij} - c\\,g_{ij}$:\n$$\nS_{ij} = T_{ij} - \\frac{29}{18}g_{ij}\n$$\nThe diagonal components are:\n$$\nS_{11} = T_{11} - \\frac{29}{18}g_{11} = 4 - \\frac{29}{18}(2) = 4 - \\frac{29}{9} = \\frac{36-29}{9} = \\frac{7}{9}\n$$\n$$\nS_{22} = T_{22} - \\frac{29}{18}g_{22} = 6 - \\frac{29}{18}(3) = 6 - \\frac{29}{6} = \\frac{36-29}{6} = \\frac{7}{6}\n$$\n$$\nS_{33} = T_{33} - \\frac{29}{18}g_{33} = 5 - \\frac{29}{18}(6) = 5 - \\frac{29}{3} = \\frac{15-29}{3} = -\\frac{14}{3}\n$$\nThe off-diagonal components of $g_{ij}$ are zero, so the off-diagonal components of $S_{ij}$ are the same as those of $T_{ij}$:\n$$\nS_{12} = T_{12} = 1, \\quad S_{13} = T_{13} = 2, \\quad S_{23} = T_{23} = 3\n$$\nDue to symmetry, $S_{21}=1$, $S_{31}=2$, and $S_{32}=3$. The component matrix for $S$ is:\n$$\nS_{ij}(p) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n7/9  1  2 \\\\\n1  7/6  3 \\\\\n2  3  -14/3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Computation of the Squared Norm of S\nThe squared norm of $S$ is given by the inner product of $S$ with itself:\n$$\n\\|S\\|^2 = \\langle S, S \\rangle_g = g^{ik}g^{jl}S_{ij}S_{kl}\n$$\nSince $g^{ij}$ is diagonal, i.e., $g^{ab}=0$ for $a \\neq b$, the only non-zero terms in the sum occur when $i=k$ and $j=l$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\|S\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 g^{ii}g^{jj}S_{ij}S_{kl}\\delta_i^k\\delta_j^l = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\sum_{j=1}^3 g^{ii}g^{jj}(S_{ij})^2\n$$\nWe can split this sum into contributions from the diagonal components ($i=j$) and the off-diagonal components ($i \\neq j$).\n$$\n\\|S\\|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^3 (g^{ii})^2(S_{ii})^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} g^{ii}g^{jj}(S_{ij})^2\n$$\nSince $S_{ij} = S_{ji}$, the off-diagonal sum can be written as $2 \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le 3} g^{ii}g^{jj}(S_{ij})^2$.\n\nFirst, the diagonal contribution:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 (g^{ii})^2(S_{ii})^2 = (g^{11})^2(S_{11})^2 + (g^{22})^2(S_{22})^2 + (g^{33})^2(S_{33})^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{7}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2\\left(-\\frac{14}{3}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{49}{81} + \\frac{1}{9}\\frac{49}{36} + \\frac{1}{36}\\frac{196}{9} = \\frac{49}{324} + \\frac{49}{324} + \\frac{196}{324} = \\frac{294}{324}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction: $\\frac{294}{324} = \\frac{147}{162} = \\frac{49}{54}$.\n\nNext, the off-diagonal contribution:\n$$\n2 \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le 3} g^{ii}g^{jj}(S_{ij})^2 = 2\\left( g^{11}g^{22}(S_{12})^2 + g^{11}g^{33}(S_{13})^2 + g^{22}g^{33}(S_{23})^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= 2\\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(1)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)(2)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)(3)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= 2\\left( \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{9}{18} \\right) = 2\\left( \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= 2\\left( \\frac{1+2+3}{6} \\right) = 2\\left( \\frac{6}{6} \\right) = 2\n$$\nThe total squared norm is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\|S\\|^2 = \\frac{49}{54} + 2 = \\frac{49 + 108}{54} = \\frac{157}{54}\n$$\nThe number $157$ is prime, so this fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{157}{54}}\n$$", "id": "2984655"}]}
