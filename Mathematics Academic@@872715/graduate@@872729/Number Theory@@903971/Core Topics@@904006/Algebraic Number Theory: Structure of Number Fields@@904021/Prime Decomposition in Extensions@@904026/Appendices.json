This is described by the Dedekind-Kummer theorem. Let $\\bar{f}(x) = f(x) \\pmod p$. If $\\bar{f}(x)$ factors into distinct irreducible polynomials in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ as $\\bar{f}(x) = \\bar{g_1}(x)^{a_1} \\cdots \\bar{g_r}(x)^{a_r}$, then the ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ factors into prime ideals as $p\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_1^{a_1} \\cdots \\mathfrak{p}_r^{a_r}$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_i = (p, g_i(w))$ and $g_i(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is any monic lift of $\\bar{g_i}(x)$.

The number of prime factors is $r(p)=r$.\n\nFor a quadratic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, the factorization of a prime $p$ (not dividing the index, which is $1$ here) is also determined by the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{D_K}{p})$:\n1. If $(\\frac{D_K}{p}) = 1$, $p$ splits into two distinct prime ideals: $p\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$. Here, $r(p)=2$, $e_1=e_2=1$, $f_1=f_2=1$.\n2. If $(\\frac{D_K}{p}) = -1$, $p$ is inert, and $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ remains a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Here, $r(p)=1$, $e_1=1$, $f_1=2$.\n3. If $(\\frac{D_K}{p}) = 0$ (i.e., $p|D_K$), $p$ ramifies: $p\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}^2$. Here, $r(p)=1$, $e_1=2$, $f_1=1$.\n\nWe now analyze each prime in $S=\\{2,3,5,13,17\\}$.

To determine the splitting behavior for $p=2$, we compute the Kronecker symbol $(\\frac{D_K}{2}) = (\\frac{13}{2})$. This is given by the formula $(\\frac{d}{2}) = (-1)^{(d^2-1)/8}$. For $d=13$, this is $(-1)^{(169-1)/8} = (-1)^{168/8} = (-1)^{21} = -1$.\nSince $(\\frac{13}{2})=-1$, the prime $2$ is inert.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $2$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\equiv x^2+x+1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ since $\\bar{f}(0)=1$ and $\\bar{f}(1)=1$.\nThus, $2\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nThe factorization is trivial: $2\\mathcal{O}_K = (2)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(2)=1$. There is one prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = 2\\mathcal{O}_K$ with ramification index $e_1=1$ and residue degree $f_1 = \\deg(x^2+x+1)=2$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nAnalysis for $p=3$:\nWe compute the Legendre symbol: $(\\frac{13}{3}) = (\\frac{13 \\pmod 3}{3}) = (\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\nSince $(\\frac{13}{3})=1$, the prime $3$ splits.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $3$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\equiv x^2 - x \\equiv x(x-1) \\pmod 3$.\nThe polynomial factors into two distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_3$.\nThus, $3\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits into two distinct prime ideals: $3\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nThe ideals are $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (3, w-0) = (3,w)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (3, w-1)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(3)=2$.\nFor both ideals, the ramification index is $e_i=1$ and the residue degree is $f_i=1$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 + e_2 f_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nAnalysis for $p=5$:\nWe compute the Legendre symbol: $(\\frac{13}{5}) = (\\frac{13 \\pmod 5}{5}) = (\\frac{3}{5})$. The quadratic residues mod $5$ are $1^2=1$ and $2^2=4$. Since $3$ is not a quadratic residue, $(\\frac{3}{5}) = -1$.\nSince $(\\frac{13}{5})=-1$, the prime $5$ is inert.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $5$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\pmod 5$.\nWe check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$: $\\bar{f}(0)=-3\\equiv 2$, $\\bar{f}(1)=-3\\equiv 2$, $\\bar{f}(2)=-1\\equiv 4$, $\\bar{f}(3)=3$, $\\bar{f}(4)=9\\equiv 4$. There are no roots, so the quadratic polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\nThus, $5\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a prime ideal.\nThe factorization is trivial: $5\\mathcal{O}_K = (5)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(5)=1$. There is one prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = 5\\mathcal{O}_K$ with $e_1=1$ and $f_1=2$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nAnalysis for $p=13$:\nThe prime $p=13$ is the discriminant of the field, $D_K=13$. Therefore, $13$ ramifies.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $13$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\pmod{13}$. The discriminant of this polynomial is $1-4(-3)=13 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$, so it has a single repeated root. The root of the derivative $2x-1$ is $x \\equiv 2^{-1} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}$.\nSo, $\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv (x-7)^2 \\pmod{13}$. (Check: $(x-7)^2=x^2-14x+49 \\equiv x^2-x+10 \\equiv x^2-x-3 \\pmod{13}$.)\nThus, $13\\mathcal{O}_K$ ramifies as the square of a prime ideal: $13\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}^2$.\nThe prime ideal is $\\mathfrak{p} = (13, w-7)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(13)=1$.\nThe ramification index is $e_1=2$ and the residue degree is $f_1=1$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nAnalysis for $p=17$:\nWe compute the Legendre symbol using quadratic reciprocity: $(\\frac{13}{17}) = (\\frac{17}{13})(-1)^{\\frac{13-1}{2}\\frac{17-1}{2}} = (\\frac{17 \\pmod{13}}{13})(-1)^{6 \\cdot 8} = (\\frac{4}{13}) = (\\frac{2^2}{13}) = 1$.\nSince $(\\frac{13}{17})=1$, the prime $17$ splits.\nUsing the polynomial method, we reduce $f(x)=x^2-x-3$ modulo $17$:\n$\\bar{f}(x) = x^2 - x - 3 \\pmod{17}$.\nWe find the roots using the quadratic formula in $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$: $x = (2^{-1})(1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(-3)}) = 9(1 \\pm \\sqrt{13})$. We need to find the square root of $13$ modulo $17$. We check squares: $8^2=64=3 \\cdot 17 + 13 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$. So $\\sqrt{13} \\equiv \\pm 8$.\nThe roots are $x_1 = 9(1+8) = 9(9) = 81 = 4 \\cdot 17 + 13 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$, and $x_2 = 9(1-8) = 9(-7) = -63 = -4 \\cdot 17 + 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{17}$.\nSo, $\\bar{f}(x) \\equiv (x-5)(x-13) \\pmod{17}$.\nThus, $17\\mathcal{O}_K$ splits into two distinct prime ideals: $17\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nThe ideals are $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (17, w-5)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (17, w-13)$.\nThe number of prime factors is $r(17)=2$.\nFor both ideals, $e_i=1$ and $f_i=1$.\nVerification: $e_1 f_1 + e_2 f_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\nFinal Calculation:\nWe have determined the number of distinct prime factors $r(p)$ for each prime $p \\in S$:\n$r(2)=1$ (inert)\n$r(3)=2$ (split)\n$r(5)=1$ (inert)\n$r(13)=1$ (ramified)\n$r(17)=2$ (split)\n\nThe problem asks for the product $R=\\prod_{p \\in S} r(p)$.\n$R = r(2) \\cdot r(3) \\cdot r(5) \\cdot r(13) \\cdot r(17) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nThe value of $R$ is a single integer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3021225"}, {"introduction": "Having surveyed the basic splitting types, we now take a deeper look at ramification, a crucial phenomenon in number theory.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured to address the four parts of the problem in the order presented.\n\n**1) Discriminant and Ring of Integers**\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^{3} - x - 1$. This matches the form $x^{3} + ax + b$ with coefficients $a = -1$ and $b = -1$. We use the provided formula for the discriminant of a monic cubic polynomial:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = -4a^{3} - 27b^{2} $$\nSubstituting the values of $a$ and $b$:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = -4(-1)^{3} - 27(-1)^{2} = -4(-1) - 27(1) = 4 - 27 = -23 $$\nThe discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $\\Delta(f) = -23$.\nA fundamental theorem in algebraic number theory states that for a number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is a root of a monic irreducible polynomial $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the discriminant of the polynomial $\\Delta(f)$ is related to the field discriminant $\\Delta_K$ by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta(f) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]^2 \\Delta_K $$\nwhere $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$ is the index of the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nIf $\\Delta(f)$ is a square-free integer, then the index must be $1$, which implies that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ is the full ring of integers, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$. In our case, $\\Delta(f) = -23$, which is a prime number and therefore square-free. Thus, we conclude that $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$.\nFurthermore, with the index being $1$, the field discriminant is equal to the polynomial discriminant: $\\Delta_K = \\Delta(f) = -23$.\n\n**2) Reduction Modulo p and Factorization**\nWe are given $p = 23$. We reduce the polynomial $f(x) = x^{3} - x - 1$ modulo $23$ to obtain a polynomial $\\bar{f}(x) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{23}[x]$.\n$$ \\bar{f}(x) = x^{3} - x - 1 \\pmod{23} $$\nTo factor $\\bar{f}(x)$, we search for its roots in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{23}$.\nLet's test a value suggested by the problem, $x=3$:\n$$ \\bar{f}(3) = 3^{3} - 3 - 1 = 27 - 3 - 1 = 23 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23} $$\nSo, $(x-3)$ is a factor of $\\bar{f}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{23}[x]$.\nLet's test another suggested value, $x=10$:\n$$ \\bar{f}(10) = 10^{3} - 10 - 1 = 1000 - 11 = 989 $$\nTo evaluate this modulo $23$, we divide $989$ by $23$: $989 = 43 \\times 23$. Thus, $989 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}$.\nSo, $(x-10)$ is also a factor.\nSince we have found two roots, $3$ and $10$, we can find the third. For a cubic $x^3+cx^2+...$, the sum of the roots is $-c$. Here the coefficient of $x^2$ is $0$, so the sum of the roots is $0$. Let the roots be $r_1, r_2, r_3$. We have $r_1=3, r_2=10$. Then $3 + 10 + r_3 = 0 \\pmod{23}$, which means $13 + r_3 = 0 \\pmod{23}$, so $r_3 = -13 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{23}$.\nThe roots are $3, 10, 10$. This indicates a repeated root at $x=10$.\nThe factorization of $\\bar{f}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{23}[x]$ is:\n$$ \\bar{f}(x) = (x-3)(x-10)^{2} $$\nThe irreducible factors are $(x-3)$ (degree $1$) and $(x-10)$ (degree $1$). Counting with multiplicity, the sum of the degrees of these factors is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$, which correctly equals the degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. As required, we have verified that there is a repeated factor, namely $(x-10)$.\n\n**3) Ramification and Residue Degrees**\nWe use Dedekind's factorization theorem. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$ (from part 1), the factorization of the ideal $(p)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is determined by the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo $p$.\nThe factorization $f(x) \\equiv (x-3)^{1}(x-10)^{2} \\pmod{23}$ gives two distinct irreducible factors, $\\bar{f_1}(x) = x-3$ and $\\bar{f_2}(x) = x-10$.\nAccording to the theorem, the ideal $(23)$ factors into prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ as:\n$$ (23) = \\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1} \\mathfrak{p}_2^{e_2} $$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (23, \\alpha-3)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (23, \\alpha-10)$. These correspond to the ideals the problem named $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_{10}$ respectively.\nThe exponents $e_i$ are the ramification indices, and they are equal to the exponents in the polynomial factorization. Thus:\n- For $\\mathfrak{p}_3 = (23, \\alpha-3)$, the exponent is $1$. So, $e(\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mid 23) = 1$.\n- For $\\mathfrak{p}_{10} = (23, \\alpha-10)$, the exponent is $2$. So, $e(\\mathfrak{p}_{10} \\mid 23) = 2$.\nThe residue degrees $f_i = f(\\mathfrak{p}_i \\mid 23)$ are the degrees of the corresponding irreducible polynomial factors.\n- For $\\mathfrak{p}_3$, the factor is $(x-3)$, which has degree $1$. So, $f(\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mid 23) = 1$.\n- For $\\mathfrak{p}_{10}$, the factor is $(x-10)$, which has degree $1$. So, $f(\\mathfrak{p}_{10} \\mid 23) = 1$.\nWe check the fundamental relation $\\sum_i e_i f_i = [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$:\n$$ e(\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mid 23) f(\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mid 23) + e(\\mathfrak{p}_{10} \\mid 23) f(\\mathfrak{p}_{10} \\mid 23) = (1)(1) + (2)(1) = 1 + 2 = 3 $$\nThis matches $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=3$, confirming our analysis. The exponents are $e(\\mathfrak{p}_{3} \\mid 23) = 1$ and $e(\\mathfrak{p}_{10} \\mid 23) = 2$.\n\n**4) Source of Ramification**\nA rational prime $p$ is said to ramify in a number field $K$ if the ideal $(p)\\mathcal{O}_K$ has a prime factor with multiplicity (ramification index) greater than $1$. From part 3, the factorization of $(23)$ is $\\mathfrak{p}_3^{1} \\mathfrak{p}_{10}^{2}$. Since the exponent of $\\mathfrak{p}_{10}$ is $2 > 1$, the prime $p=23$ ramifies in $K$.\nThe theoretical source of this ramification is given by Dedekind's discriminant theorem, which states that a prime $p$ ramifies in $K$ if and only if $p$ divides the field discriminant $\\Delta_K$. In part 1, we computed $\\Delta_K = -23$. Since $23$ is a divisor of $-23$, the prime $p=23$ must ramify in $K$.\nThe connection between the discriminant and the reduction of $f(x)$ is as follows: A polynomial has a multiple root if and only if its discriminant is zero. For the polynomial $\\bar{f}(x) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, its discriminant, $\\Delta(\\bar{f})$, is the discriminant of $f(x)$ reduced modulo $p$. That is, $\\Delta(\\bar{f}) = \\Delta(f) \\pmod p$.\nThus, $\\bar{f}(x)$ has a multiple root if and only if $\\Delta(f) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$.\nIn our case, $\\Delta(f) = -23$, so for $p=23$, we have $\\Delta(f) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23}$. This implies that $\\bar{f}(x)$ must have a multiple root in $\\mathbb{F}_{23}$, which we explicitly found in part 2: the root $10$ has multiplicity $2$.\nIn the context where Dedekind's factorization theorem applies (i.e., when $p$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$, which is true here as the index is $1$), the exponent of a prime ideal factor of $(p)$ is equal to the multiplicity of the corresponding root in the factorization of $\\bar{f}(x)$. Therefore, the existence of a multiple root of $\\bar{f}(x)$ modulo $p$ is the direct cause of ramification at $p$.\nThe final question asks for the value of $e(\\mathfrak{p}_{10} \\mid 23)$. As determined in part 3, this is the exponent of the factor $(x-10)$ in the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo $23$, which is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3021248"}, {"introduction": "We now advance to a higher-degree extension, the cyclotomic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$, which has degree six over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

Report your final result as the ordered tuple $(f(2),f(3),f(5),f(11),f(13),f(7))$. No rounding is required; provide exact integers.", "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed and factually correct exercise in algebraic number theory. It is based on established principles, free of ambiguities, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ be the cyclotomic field generated by a primitive seventh root of unity, $\\zeta_7$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_7]$. The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\varphi(7) = 6$, where $\\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. The Galois group is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$.\n\nFor a rational prime $p$, the ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_K$ factors in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ as a product of prime ideals. In a Galois extension, this factorization is of the form $p\\mathcal{O}_K = (\\mathfrak{P}_1 \\cdots \\mathfrak{P}_g)^e$, where $e$ is the ramification index, $f$ is the residue degree of each prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}_i$, and $g$ is the number of such ideals. These quantities are related by the fundamental formula $efg=[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=6$.\n\nThe splitting behavior of a prime $p$ in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ depends on whether $p$ divides $n$. Here, $n=7$. We analyze two distinct cases.\n\nCase 1: The prime $p$ does not divide $7$.\nThis case applies to $p \\in \\{2, 3, 5, 11, 13\\}$. A key theorem in the theory of cyclotomic fields states that a rational prime $p$ is unramified in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ if and only if $p$ does not divide $n$. For an unramified prime, the ramification index is $e=1$.\n\nThe residue degree $f$ is the order of the decomposition group $D(\\mathfrak{P}|p)$, which for an abelian extension like $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is generated by the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$. The action of $\\text{Frob}_p$ on $\\zeta_7$ is given by $\\text{Frob}_p(\\zeta_7) = \\zeta_7^p$. The order of this automorphism in the Galois group $G$ determines $f$. Under the canonical isomorphism $G \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, this corresponds to finding the multiplicative order of the residue class of $p$ modulo $7$. The number of prime ideals is then $g = 6/(ef) = 6/f$.\n\nWe proceed to compute the order of each prime modulo $7$:\n- For $p=2$: We compute the powers of $2$ modulo $7$: $2^1 \\equiv 2$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$. The order of $2$ is $3$. Thus, the residue degree is $f(2)=3$. The splitting type is $(e,f,g) = (1, 3, 6/3) = (1, 3, 2)$.\n\n- For $p=3$: We compute the powers of $3$ modulo $7$: $3^1 \\equiv 3$, $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 2$, $3^3 \\equiv 6$, $3^4 \\equiv 4$, $3^5 \\equiv 5$, $3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$. The order of $3$ is $6$. Thus, the residue degree is $f(3)=6$. The splitting type is $(e,f,g) = (1, 6, 6/6) = (1, 6, 1)$, meaning the ideal $3\\mathcal{O}_K$ is inert.\n\n- For $p=5$: We compute the powers of $5$ modulo $7$: $5^1 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 4$, $5^3 \\equiv 20 \\equiv 6$, $5^4 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 2$, $5^5 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 3$, $5^6 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$. The order of $5$ is $6$. Thus, the residue degree is $f(5)=6$. The splitting type is $(e,f,g) = (1, 6, 1)$, so $5\\mathcal{O}_K$ is also inert.\n\n- For $p=11$: We consider $11 \\pmod 7$, which is $4$. We compute the powers of $4$ modulo $7$: $4^1 \\equiv 4$, $4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 2$, $4^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$. The order of $4$ is $3$. Thus, the residue degree is $f(11)=3$. The splitting type is $(e,f,g) = (1, 3, 2)$.\n\n- For $p=13$: We consider $13 \\pmod 7$, which is $6 \\equiv -1$. We compute the powers of $-1$ modulo $7$: $(-1)^1 \\equiv -1$, $(-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$. The order of $-1$ is $2$. Thus, the residue degree is $f(13)=2$. The splitting type is $(e,f,g) = (1, 2, 6/2) = (1, 2, 3)$.\n\nCase 2: The prime $p$ divides $7$.\nThis case applies to $p=7$. A prime $p$ ramifies in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ if and only if $p|n$. When $n=p$ is a prime number, the prime $p$ is totally ramified in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$.\nTotal ramification means that there is only one prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $p$, so $g=1$, and the ramification index is equal to the degree of the extension, $e = [K:\\mathbb{Q}]=6$.\nSubstituting these values into the fundamental relation $efg=6$, we get $6 \\cdot f \\cdot 1 = 6$, which implies that the residue degree must be $f(7)=1$.\nThe splitting type for $p=7$ is $(e,f,g)=(6,1,1)$.\nThe unique prime ideal lying over $7$ is $(1-\\zeta_7)$, and the factorization is $7\\mathcal{O}_K = (1-\\zeta_7)^6$. The residue field $\\mathcal{O}_K/(1-\\zeta_7)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$, which is an extension of degree $f=1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nIn summary, the residue degrees are:\n$f(2) = 3$\n$f(3) = 6$\n$f(5) = 6$\n$f(11) = 3$\n$f(13) = 2$\n$f(7) = 1$\n\nThe problem asks for the final result as the ordered tuple $(f(2), f(3), f(5), f(11), f(13), f(7))$. Assembling the values, we obtain the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 1)}$$", "id": "3021235"}]}
