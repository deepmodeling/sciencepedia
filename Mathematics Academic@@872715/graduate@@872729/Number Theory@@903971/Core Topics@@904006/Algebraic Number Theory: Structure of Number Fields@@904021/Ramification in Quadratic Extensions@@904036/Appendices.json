Otherwise, it is a complex embedding. For $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, the two embeddings are $\\sigma_{1}(a+b\\sqrt{d}) = a+b\\sqrt{d}$ and $\\sigma_{2}(a+b\\sqrt{d}) = a-b\\sqrt{d}$.\n\n- If $d>0$, then $\\sqrt{d}$ is a real number. For any element $x \\in K$, both $\\sigma_1(x)$ and $\\sigma_2(x)$ are real numbers. Thus, for $d>0$, the field $K$ is called a real quadratic field and has two real embeddings ($\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$).\n- If $d0$, then $\\sqrt{d}$ is a purely imaginary number. For any $x = a+b\\sqrt{d} \\in K$ with $b \\neq 0$, the values $\\sigma_1(x)$ and $\\sigma_2(x)$ are not real. Thus, for $d0$, the field $K$ is called an imaginary quadratic field and has zero real embeddings. It has a pair of complex conjugate embeddings ($\\sigma_{2}(x)=\\overline{\\sigma_{1}(x)}$).\n\nNow we analyze the sign of $\\Delta_{K} = (\\det(M))^2$. Let $\\{\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}\\}$ be an integral basis. The determinant is $\\det(M) = \\sigma_{1}(\\alpha_1)\\sigma_{2}(\\alpha_2) - \\sigma_{2}(\\alpha_1)\\sigma_{1}(\\alpha_2)$.\n\nCase 1: $d>0$ (Two real embeddings).\nIn this case, $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ are real embeddings. Since the basis elements $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}$ are in $K$, their images $\\sigma_{j}(\\alpha_{i})$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ are all real numbers. Consequently, the matrix $M$ is a real matrix. Its determinant, $\\det(M)$, is a real number. The discriminant is $\\Delta_{K} = (\\det(M))^2$. Since $\\det(M)$ is a non-zero real number (as the basis elements are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$), its square must be positive. Therefore, if $K$ has two real embeddings, $\\Delta_{K} > 0$. This is observed in our calculations for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ ($\\Delta_K = 8 > 0$) and $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ ($\\Delta_K=5 > 0$).\n\nCase 2: $d0$ (Zero real embeddings).\nIn this case, the embeddings are a complex conjugate pair, $\\sigma_{2} = \\overline{\\sigma_{1}}$. Let us denote $\\sigma_1$ by $\\sigma$. Then $\\sigma_2 = \\overline{\\sigma}$. The matrix $M$ takes the form:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma(\\alpha_{1})  \\overline{\\sigma(\\alpha_{1})} \\\\ \\sigma(\\alpha_{2})  \\overline{\\sigma(\\alpha_{2})} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet $z_{1} = \\sigma(\\alpha_{1})$ and $z_{2} = \\sigma(\\alpha_{2})$. The determinant is $\\det(M) = z_{1}\\overline{z_{2}} - \\overline{z_{1}}z_{2}$.\nIf we write $z_{1} = u_{1} + iv_{1}$ and $z_{2} = u_{2} + iv_{2}$, then:\n$\\det(M) = (u_{1}+iv_{1})(u_{2}-iv_{2}) - (u_{1}-iv_{1})(u_{2}+iv_{2})$\n$= (u_{1}u_{2}+v_{1}v_{2} + i(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})) - (u_{1}u_{2}+v_{1}v_{2} + i(u_{1}v_{2}-u_{2}v_{1}))$\n$= 2i(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})$.\nSince $\\{\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, the complex numbers $\\{z_{1}, z_{2}\\}$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that the term $u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2}$ is a non-zero real number. Thus, $\\det(M)$ is a non-zero purely imaginary number.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_{K} = (\\det(M))^2 = (2i(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2}))^2 = -4(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})^2$.\nSince $(u_{2}v_{1}-u_{1}v_{2})^2 > 0$, the discriminant $\\Delta_{K}$ must be negative. Therefore, if $K$ has zero real embeddings, $\\Delta_{K}  0$. This is observed for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$ ($\\Delta_K=-4  0$) and $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ ($\\Delta_K=-3  0$).\n\nIn summary, the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ is determined by the number of real embeddings: it is positive if there are two real embeddings ($d>0$) and negative if there are zero real embeddings ($d0$). This corresponds to the sign of $(-1)^{r_2}$, where $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex embeddings.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4  -3  8  5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3021882"}, {"introduction": "With a solid grasp of the discriminant, we can now explore its primary function: predicting how rational primes decompose in a quadratic extension.

It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in number theory. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe field in question is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$. Since $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right]$. An integral generator for $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the element $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{13}}{2}$. Its minimal polynomial, $f(x)$, is found as follows:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{13}}{2} \\implies 2\\alpha - 1 = \\sqrt{13} $$\n$$ (2\\alpha - 1)^2 = 13 \\implies 4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha + 1 = 13 $$\n$$ 4\\alpha^2 - 4\\alpha - 12 = 0 \\implies \\alpha^2 - \\alpha - 3 = 0 $$\nThus, the monic minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $f(x) = x^2 - x - 3$. The discriminant of this polynomial is $D_{poly} = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 1 + 12 = 13$. This coincides with the given field discriminant $\\Delta_K = 13$.\n\nThe behavior of a rational prime $p$ in the extension $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is determined by the factorization of the ideal $(p) = p\\mathcal{O}_K$. According to a fundamental theorem of algebraic number theory (Dedekind's criterion), for a prime $p$ not dividing the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]$, the factorization of $(p)$ mirrors the factorization of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ modulo $p$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]$, the index is $1$, so this criterion holds for all primes $p$.\n\nThe factorization of $f(x) \\pmod p$ is determined by its discriminant, $D_{poly} = 13$.\n1.  If $p$ divides the discriminant of the field $\\Delta_K$, then $p$ **ramifies**. The ideal $(p)$ factors as $\\mathfrak{p}^2$ for some prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. In this case, $s(p)=0$.\n2.  If $p$ does not divide $\\Delta_K$, its behavior is determined by whether the discriminant is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This is captured by the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{p}\\right)$ for odd primes $p$, and by the Kronecker symbol for $p=2$.\n    -   If $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{p}\\right) = 1$, then $f(x) \\pmod p$ splits into two distinct linear factors. The prime $p$ **splits**, meaning $(p) = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$ for distinct prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_1, \\mathfrak{p}_2$. In this case, $s(p)=1$.\n    -   If $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{p}\\right) = -1$, then $f(x) \\pmod p$ is irreducible. The prime $p$ is **inert**, meaning $(p)$ remains a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. In this case, $s(p)=-1$.\n\nWe will now apply this framework to each prime $p \\leq 17$, with $\\Delta_K = 13$. The primes to check are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17$.\n\n- **For $p=2$**: We evaluate the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{13}{2}\\right)$. Since $13 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$, the symbol is $\\left(\\frac{13}{2}\\right) = -1$. Thus, $2$ is inert in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. $s(2)=-1$.\n- **For $p=3$**: We evaluate the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{13}{3}\\right)$.\n  $\\left(\\frac{13}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{13 \\pmod 3}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1$. Thus, $3$ splits in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. $s(3)=1$.\n- **For $p=5$**: We evaluate $\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right)$. Using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity:\n  $\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{13-1}{2}\\frac{5-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) (-1)^{(6)(2)} = \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)$.\n  We can evaluate $\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)$ using reciprocity again: $\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{5-1}{2}\\frac{13-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$.\n  Finally, $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{3-1}{2}\\frac{5-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -1$.\n  Alternatively, and more directly, $\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = -1$, since $3$ is not a square modulo $5$. Thus, $5$ is inert. $s(5)=-1$.\n- **For $p=7$**: We evaluate $\\left(\\frac{13}{7}\\right)$.\n  $\\left(\\frac{13}{7}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{7}\\right)$. Since $7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, this is $-1$. Thus, $7$ is inert. $s(7)=-1$.\n- **For $p=11$**: We evaluate $\\left(\\frac{13}{11}\\right)$.\n  $\\left(\\frac{13}{11}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right)$. Since $11 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$, we have $\\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right) = -1$. Thus, $11$ is inert. $s(11)=-1$.\n- **For $p=13$**: The prime $13$ is the discriminant of the field, $\\Delta_K=13$. Therefore, $p=13$ is the only prime that ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. $s(13)=0$.\n- **For $p=17$**: We evaluate $\\left(\\frac{13}{17}\\right)$. Using Quadratic Reciprocity:\n  $\\left(\\frac{13}{17}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{17}{13}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{13-1}{2}\\frac{17-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{17 \\pmod{13}}{13}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{13}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^2}{13}\\right) = 1$.\n  Thus, $17$ splits in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. $s(17)=1$.\n\nSummarizing the results for $s(p)$:\n- $s(2)=-1$\n- $s(3)=1$\n- $s(5)=-1$\n- $s(7)=-1$\n- $s(11)=-1$\n- $s(13)=0$\n- $s(17)=1$\n\nThe final result is reported as the specified row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1  1  -1  -1  -1  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3021888"}, {"introduction": "The theory of ramification is defined with respect to the maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_K$, but what happens in smaller subrings?

The questions posed are standard exercises in the theory of quadratic fields and their orders. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and objective. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe solution is constructed based on the fundamental definitions as requested.\n\nFirst, we identify the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. For a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ being a square-free integer, the ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$, we have $d=6$, which is square-free. Since $6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{6}]$.\n\nNext, we identify the order and its conductor. The order is given as $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{150}]$. We can simplify the generator: $\\sqrt{150} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 6} = 5\\sqrt{6}$. So, the order is $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[5\\sqrt{6}]$. This is clearly a subring of $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{6}]$.\nThe conductor of the order $\\mathcal{R}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the ideal $\\mathfrak{f} = \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K \\mid \\alpha\\mathcal{O}_K \\subseteq \\mathcal{R}\\}$. Let an element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ be written as $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{6}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $\\alpha$ to be in the conductor $\\mathfrak{f}$, two conditions must be met, based on $\\alpha \\cdot 1 \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and $\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt{6} \\in \\mathcal{R}$ (since $\\{1, \\sqrt{6}\\}$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$):\n1.  $\\alpha \\cdot 1 = a + b\\sqrt{6} \\in \\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[5\\sqrt{6}]$. An element of $\\mathcal{R}$ is of the form $x + y(5\\sqrt{6})$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Comparing coefficients of $\\sqrt{6}$, we must have $b$ as a multiple of $5$.\n2.  $\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = (a+b\\sqrt{6})\\sqrt{6} = 6b + a\\sqrt{6} \\in \\mathcal{R}$. Comparing coefficients of $\\sqrt{6}$, we must have $a$ as a multiple of $5$.\nSo, any element $\\alpha \\in \\mathfrak{f}$ must be of the form $5a' + 5b'\\sqrt{6} = 5(a'+b'\\sqrt{6})$ for some integers $a', b'$. This means $\\mathfrak{f} = 5\\mathcal{O}_K$. The integer $f=5$ generating this principal ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is often called the conductor of the order.\n\nNow we verify the divisibility conditions for $p=5$.\nThe conductor is $f=5$. Clearly, $p=5$ divides $f=5$.\nThe discriminant of the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ is $\\Delta_K = 4d = 4 \\cdot 6 = 24$. The prime $p=5$ does not divide $\\Delta_K = 24$. The verification is successful.\n\nNext, we determine the factorization of the ideal $(p) = (5)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{6}]$. Since $p=5$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{6}]]=1$, we can use Dedekind's criterion with the minimal polynomial of the generator $\\sqrt{6}$, which is $P(x) = x^2 - 6$. We reduce this polynomial modulo $5$:\n$P(x) \\equiv x^2 - 6 \\equiv x^2 - 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nThis polynomial factors as $(x-1)(x+1) \\pmod{5}$. Since it splits into two distinct linear factors, the ideal $(5)$ splits into two distinct prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_K$:\n$(5)\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathfrak{p}_1 \\mathfrak{p}_2$, where $\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (5, \\sqrt{6}-1)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (5, \\sqrt{6}+1)$.\nThis confirms that $5$ splits in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. This is consistent with the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{p}) = (\\frac{24}{5}) = (\\frac{4}{5}) = 1$.\n\nNow, we determine the factorization of $(p) = (5)$ in the non-maximal order $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{150}]$. The prime $p=5$ divides the conductor $f=5$. The decomposition of $(p)\\mathcal{R}$ is analyzed by examining the quotient ring $\\mathcal{R}/(p)\\mathcal{R}$.\n$\\mathcal{R}/(5)\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{150}]/(5) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2-150, 5)$.\nReducing the polynomial modulo $5$, we get $x^2 - 150 \\equiv x^2 - 0 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{5}$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{R}/(5)\\mathcal{R} \\cong \\mathbb{F}_5[x]/(x^2)$.\nThis quotient ring is not a field; it has nilpotent elements (e.g., $\\bar{x}$). Thus, the ideal $(5)\\mathcal{R}$ is not prime. The ring $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]/(x^2)$ has a unique prime ideal, which is $(\\bar{x})$. Its square is $(\\bar{x})^2 = (\\bar{x}^2) = (0)$.\nThis implies that there is a unique prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $\\mathcal{R}$ lying over $5$. This ideal corresponds to $(\\bar{x})$ and is given by $\\mathfrak{P} = (5, \\sqrt{150})_{\\mathcal{R}}$. The nilpotency of $(\\bar{x})$ implies that $\\mathfrak{P}^2 \\subseteq (5)\\mathcal{R}$. This situation is described as the prime $5$ being ramified in the order $\\mathcal{R}$. The factorization is conventionally written as $(5)\\mathcal{R} = \\mathfrak{P}^2$, noting that this describes the ramification behavior even though equality might not hold as $\\mathcal{R}$ is not a Dedekind domain.\n\nFinally, we compute the quantity $\\nu_p(\\Delta(\\mathcal{R})) - \\nu_p(\\Delta_K)$, where $p=5$.\nThe field discriminant is $\\Delta_K = 24$. The $5$-adic valuation is $\\nu_5(\\Delta_K) = \\nu_5(24) = 0$, since $5$ does not divide $24$.\nThe discriminant of the order $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{150}]$ with $\\mathbb{Z}$-basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{150}\\}$ is given by:\n$\\Delta(\\mathcal{R}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Tr}(1 \\cdot 1)  \\text{Tr}(1 \\cdot \\sqrt{150}) \\\\ \\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{150} \\cdot 1)  \\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{150} \\cdot \\sqrt{150}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Tr}(1)  \\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{150}) \\\\ \\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{150})  \\text{Tr}(150) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe trace of an element $a+b\\sqrt{6} \\in K$ is $2a$. So, $\\text{Tr}(1)=2$, $\\text{Tr}(\\sqrt{150}) = \\text{Tr}(5\\sqrt{6})=0$, and $\\text{Tr}(150)=2 \\cdot 150=300$.\n$\\Delta(\\mathcal{R}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  300 \\end{pmatrix} = 600$.\nThe $5$-adic valuation of this discriminant is $\\nu_5(\\Delta(\\mathcal{R})) = \\nu_5(600)$. We factor $600 = 6 \\cdot 100 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 10^2 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5)^2 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.\nThus, $\\nu_5(600) = 2$.\nThe desired quantity is $\\nu_5(\\Delta(\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{150}])) - \\nu_5(\\Delta_K) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n\nThis result can be verified using the general formula relating the discriminant of an order to the field discriminant: $\\Delta(\\mathcal{R}) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathcal{R}]^2 \\Delta_K$.\nThe index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathcal{R}]$ is the determinant of the change-of-basis matrix from a basis of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ to a basis of $\\mathcal{R}$. Using bases $\\{1, \\sqrt{6}\\}$ for $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and $\\{1, 5\\sqrt{6}\\}$ for $\\mathcal{R}$, the matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  5 \\end{pmatrix}$, with determinant $5$. So the index is $5$. This is, by definition, the conductor integer $f$.\n$\\Delta(\\mathcal{R}) = 5^2 \\cdot 24 = 25 \\cdot 24 = 600$, which matches our prior calculation.\nThen, $\\nu_p(\\Delta(\\mathcal{R})) - \\nu_p(\\Delta_K) = \\nu_p(f^2 \\Delta_K) - \\nu_p(\\Delta_K)$. Using the property $\\nu_p(ab) = \\nu_p(a) + \\nu_p(b)$, this becomes $( \\nu_p(f^2) + \\nu_p(\\Delta_K) ) - \\nu_p(\\Delta_K) = \\nu_p(f^2) = 2\\nu_p(f)$.\nWith $p=5$ and $f=5$, this is $2\\nu_5(5) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3021894"}]}
