The roots of $x^4-2=0$ are $\\sqrt[4]{2}$, $i\\sqrt[4]{2}$, $-\\sqrt[4]{2}$, and $-i\\sqrt[4]{2}$. The splitting field is thus $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$. The polynomial $x^4-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for $p=2$, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, $i \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$, so $[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})] = 2$. By the tower law, $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})][\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $8$. An automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on the generators $\\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $i$. There are $4$ choices for $\\sigma(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ (the roots of $x^4-2$) and $2$ choices for $\\sigma(i)$ (the roots of $x^2+1$). This gives $8$ automorphisms. Let's define $r$ and $s$ by:\n$r(\\sqrt[4]{2}) = i\\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $r(i) = i$.\n$s(\\sqrt[4]{2}) = \\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $s(i) = -i$.\nOne can check that $r$ has order $4$, $s$ has order $2$, and they satisfy the relation $srs^{-1}=r^{-1}$. Thus, $G$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order $8$, $D_4$.\n\nFor any prime $p$, the degree of the extension is related to the number of primes $g$ lying over $p$, the ramification index $e$, and the residue degree $f$ by the formula $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = gef$. Since $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, $e$ and $f$ are the same for all primes $\\mathfrak{P}$ lying over $p$. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = ef$. The number of distinct primes above $p$ is $g = [G:D_{\\mathfrak{P}}] = |G|/|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|$.\n\nWe now analyze each prime individually.\n\nCase $p=2$:\nThe prime $p=2$ is the one for which Eisenstein's criterion applies to $x^4-2$. The discriminant of the polynomial $x^4-2$ is $-256(2)^3 = -2^{11}$. The discriminant of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ is also a power of $2$. The discriminant of $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is $-4=-2^2$. This means $p=2$ is the only prime that ramifies in $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTo determine the structure of the decomposition, we consider the extension of local fields $K_{\\mathfrak{P}}/\\mathbb{Q}_2$, where $\\mathfrak{P}$ is a prime of $K$ over $2$. The degree of this local extension is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|$. The field $K_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the compositum of $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt[4]{2})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}_2(i)$.\nThe polynomial $x^4-2$ is an Eisenstein polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Thus, the extension $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt[4]{2})/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is a totally ramified extension of degree $4$. Its ramification index is $e_1=4$ and its residue degree is $f_1=1$.\nThe polynomial $x^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ because $-1 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, so by Hensel's lemma, $-1$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}_2(i)/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is an unramified quadratic extension. Its ramification index is $e_2=1$ and its residue degree is $f_2=2$.\nThe compositum $K_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$ is the extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ obtained by adjoining generators for a totally ramified extension and an unramified extension. The intersection of these two extensions is $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Therefore, the ramification index of the compositum is $e = e_1=4$ and the residue degree is $f = f_2 = 2$.\nThe degree of the local extension is $[K_{\\mathfrak{P}}:\\mathbb{Q}_2]=ef = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\nThe order of the decomposition group is equal to this degree, so $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = 8$.\nFor $p=2$, we found $e=4$ and $f=2$. Since $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = 8 = |G|$, we have $g=1$. This means $2$ is totally ramified in a specific sense, as $(2)=\\mathfrak{P}^e$ is not true, but there is only one prime ideal above $2$. The values satisfy $gef=1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$. The inertia group $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ has order $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=e=4$.\n\nCase $p=3$:\nThe prime $p=3$ does not divide the discriminant of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, so it is unramified. This means $e=1$ for any prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $3$. The inertia group $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is trivial. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = f$.\nTo find $f$, we analyze the decomposition in the tower $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(i) \\subset K$.\n1. Extension $\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}$: Since $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, the prime $3$ is inert in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. So $3\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} = \\mathfrak{p}_3$ is a prime ideal. For this sub-extension, we have $g_1=1$, $e_1=1$, $f_1=2$. The residue field $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)}/\\mathfrak{p}_3 \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{3^2} = \\mathbb{F}_9$.\n2. Extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$: We consider the factorization of $x^4-2$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_9$. The field $\\mathbb{F}_9$ can be constructed as $\\mathbb{F}_3[t]/(t^2+1)$. Let $j$ be a root of $t^2+1=0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_9$, so $j^2=-1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Thus, $2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_9$. The polynomial becomes $x^4-2 \\equiv x^4-j^2 = (x^2-j)(x^2+j) \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}_3}$. Now we must check if $j$ and $-j$ are squares in $\\mathbb{F}_9$. The multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_9^*$ is cyclic of order $8$. An element $y$ is a square if and only if $y^{(9-1)/2}=y^4=1$. Let's check for $j$: $j^4 = (j^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$. So $j$ is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_9$. Similarly, $(-j)^4 = (-1)^4 j^4 = 1$, so $-j$ is also a square. Therefore, $x^4-2$ splits into four distinct linear factors over $\\mathbb{F}_9$.\nBy the theory of Kummer extensions (or Dedekind's theorem), this implies that the prime $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ splits completely in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. For this stage, we have $g_2=4$, $e_2=1$, $f_2=1$.\nCombining the results for the full extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$:\nThe number of primes is $g=g_1 g_2 = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$.\nThe ramification index is $e=e_1 e_2 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe residue degree is $f=f_1 f_2 = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\nCheck: $gef=4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 8$. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = ef = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nCase $p=5$:\nThe prime $p=5$ is also unramified, so $e=1$ and $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=1$. Again, $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=f$.\n1. Extension $\\mathbb{Q}(i)/\\mathbb{Q}$: Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the prime $5$ splits in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We have $5\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(i)} = \\mathfrak{p}_5 \\mathfrak{p}'_5$, for example $\\mathfrak{p}_5 = (2+i)$. For this sub-extension, we have $g_1=2$, $e_1=1$, $f_1=1$. The residue field for each prime factor is $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n2. Extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$: We consider the factorization of $x^4-2$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_5$. The polynomial is $x^4-2 \\equiv x^4+3 \\pmod 5$.\nWe check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$: $f(0)=3$, $f(1)=4$, $f(2)=16+3 \\equiv 4$, $f(3)=81+3 \\equiv 4$, $f(4)=(-1)^4+3=4$. There are no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\nTo check for irreducibility, we can test for roots in the extension field $\\mathbb{F}_{5^2}=\\mathbb{F}_{25}$. A root $x$ would satisfy $x^4 = -3 = 2$. This requires $2$ to be a fourth power in $\\mathbb{F}_{25}^*$. The group $\\mathbb{F}_{25}^*$ is cyclic of order $24$. An element $y$ is a fourth power if and only if $y^{24/\\gcd(4,24)} = y^6 = 1$. For $y=2$, we compute $2^6=64 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$. Since $4 \\neq 1$, $2$ is not a fourth power in $\\mathbb{F}_{25}$. Thus, $x^4+3$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{25}$. A quartic polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ that has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ must be irreducible. Hence, $x^4+3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\nThis implies that the prime $\\mathfrak{p}_5$ is inert in the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. For this stage, we have $g_2=1$, $e_2=1$, $f_2=4$.\nCombining the results for the full extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$:\nThe prime $5$ splits into two primes $\\mathfrak{p}_5, \\mathfrak{p}_5'$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and each of these remains inert in the extension to $K$. So, there are $g=2$ primes above $5$ in $K$.\nFor a given prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ above $p=5$, the ramification index is $e = e(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}_5)e(\\mathfrak{p}_5/5) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThe residue degree is $f = f(\\mathfrak{P}/\\mathfrak{p}_5)f(\\mathfrak{p}_5/5) = 4 \\cdot 1 = 4$.\nCheck: $gef=2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 8$. The order of the decomposition group is $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = ef = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$.\n\nIn summary:\n- For $p=2$: $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=8$. The prime is ramified ($e=4, f=2$). The non-trivial inertia group $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=4$ signals ramification. The fact that $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=|G|$ implies $g=1$, so the prime ideal does not split.\n- For $p=3$: $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=2$. The prime is unramified ($e=1, f=2$). The triviality of $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ shows it is unramified. The order $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=2$ implies $g=|G|/|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}| = 8/2=4$. The prime $3$ splits into $4$ distinct primes.\n- For $p=5$: $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=4$. The prime is unramified ($e=1, f=4$). The triviality of $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ shows it is unramified. The order $|D_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=4$ implies $g=8/4=2$. The prime $5$ splits into $2$ distinct primes.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix of these orders.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n8 & 2 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3025526"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond its order, the internal structure of the decomposition group $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ reveals a richer story.

The field $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $F(X) = X^3 - 2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, because its roots are $\\alpha, \\zeta_3 \\alpha, \\zeta_3^2 \\alpha$, and $L$ contains both $\\alpha$ and $\\zeta_3$. Therefore, $L/K$ is a Galois extension.\n\nLet us analyze the structure of this extension by considering its subfields.\nLet $K_u = K(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\zeta_3)$. The minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $X^2+X+1$. Its discriminant is $-3$. In $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, a $2$-adic unit $u \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$ is a square if and only if $u \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. Since $-3 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$, $-3$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Thus, $X^2+X+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nHence, $[K_u : K] = 2$.\nThe discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\zeta_3\\}$ is $-3$, which is a $2$-adic unit. This implies that the extension $K_u/K$ is unramified. The ramification index is $e(K_u/K) = 1$ and the residue field degree is $f(K_u/K) = 2$. The residue field of $K_u$ is $\\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$. $K_u$ is the maximal unramified subextension of $L/K$.\n\nLet $K_r = K(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha^3 = 2$. The polynomial $f(X) = X^3 - 2$ is an Eisenstein polynomial with respect to the prime $p=2$ of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. By Eisenstein's criterion, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nHence, $[K_r : K] = 3$.\nSince the minimal polynomial is Eisenstein, the extension $K_r/K$ is totally ramified. The ramification index is $e(K_r/K) = 3$ and the residue field degree is $f(K_r/K) = 1$. The ramification index $e=3$ is prime to the residue characteristic $p=2$, so this is a tamely ramified extension.\n\nThe field $L = K(\\zeta_3, \\alpha)$ is the compositum of $K_u$ and $K_r$. Since their degrees over $K$ are $2$ and $3$, which are coprime, the degree of the composite extension is $[L:K] = [K_u:K][K_r:K] = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\nThe ramification index of the composite extension is $e(L/K) = e(K_u/K) \\cdot e(K_r/K) = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3$.\nThe residue field degree is $f(L/K) = f(K_u/K) \\cdot f(K_r/K) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\nAs a check, $[L:K] = e(L/K)f(L/K) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n\nLet $G = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. For an extension of local fields, there is a unique prime $\\mathfrak{P}$ in the ring of integers of $L$ lying above the prime $(2)$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The decomposition group $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is defined as the subgroup of $G$ consisting of automorphisms that fix $\\mathfrak{P}$. For an extension of local fields, the Galois group acts transitively on the primes above the base prime, and since there is only one such prime, the entire Galois group must be the decomposition group. Thus, $D_{\\mathfrak{P}} = G$.\n\nWe now determine the structure of $G \\cong D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$. $G$ is a group of order $6$. There are two possibilities: the cyclic group $C_6$ or the symmetric group $S_3$.\nThe extension contains the unramified part $K_u$ and the totally ramified part $K_r$. Let's choose generators for $G$.\nLet $\\tau \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_u)$. This is the subgroup corresponding to the fixed field $K_u$. Its order is $[L:K_u] = [K_r:K] = 3$. We can define $\\tau$ by its action on the generators: $\\tau(\\zeta_3) = \\zeta_3$ and $\\tau(\\alpha) = \\zeta_3\\alpha$. It follows that $\\tau^3 = \\mathrm{id}$.\nLet $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_r)$. This subgroup corresponds to the fixed field $K_r$. Its order is $[L:K_r] = [K_u:K] = 2$.

We compute the action of the conjugate $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}$ on the generators $\\alpha$ and $\\zeta_3$. Since $\\sigma^{-1}=\\sigma$:\n$\\sigma\\tau\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\sigma\\tau(\\alpha) = \\sigma(\\zeta_3\\alpha) = \\sigma(\\zeta_3)\\sigma(\\alpha) = \\zeta_3^{-1}\\alpha$.\n$\\sigma\\tau\\sigma(\\zeta_3) = \\sigma\\tau(\\zeta_3^{-1}) = \\sigma(\\zeta_3^{-1})$ (since $\\tau$ fixes $\\zeta_3$) $= (\\zeta_3^{-1})^{-1} = \\zeta_3$.\nMeanwhile, $\\tau^{-1}$ acts as $\\tau^{-1}(\\alpha) = \\zeta_3^{-1}\\alpha$ and $\\tau^{-1}(\\zeta_3) = \\zeta_3$.\nThe actions of $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}$ and $\\tau^{-1}$ on the generators are identical, so the automorphisms are the same: $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}$.\nThe relations $\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{id}$, $\\tau^3 = \\mathrm{id}$, and $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}$ are the defining relations for the symmetric group on $3$ elements, $S_3$. Thus, $D_{\\mathfrak{P}} = G \\cong S_3$.\n\nThe analysis of the inertia group and Frobenius element confirms this structure.\nThe inertia group $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the kernel of the surjective homomorphism from $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ to the Galois group of the residue field extension, $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{2^2}/\\mathbb{F}_2)$.\nThe order of $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the ramification index $e(L/K) = 3$. In $S_3$, the unique subgroup of order $3$ is the alternating group $A_3$. This subgroup is generated by any $3$-cycle. In our case, $I_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$.\nThe residue characteristic is $p=2$. The order of the inertia group, $|I_{\\mathfrak{P}}|=3$, is prime to $p$. Therefore, the wild inertia subgroup is trivial, and $I_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is the tame inertia subgroup. From the structure of Galois groups of local fields, $I_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K_u) = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$, which is consistent.\n\nA lift of the Frobenius element to $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ is any element in $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}$ whose image generates $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{2^2}/\\mathbb{F}_2)$. The quotient is $D_{\\mathfrak{P}}/I_{\\mathfrak{P}} \\cong S_3/A_3 \\cong C_2$. The non-identity coset is represented by $\\sigma$. Thus, we can take $\\sigma$ as a lift of Frobenius. The action by conjugation of this lift on the tame inertia subgroup $I_{\\mathfrak{P}} = \\langle \\tau \\rangle$ is given by the relation we already derived: $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}$.\n\nThe final task is to determine the order of the commutator subgroup $[D_{\\mathfrak{P}}, D_{\\mathfrak{P}}]$. We have established that $D_{\\mathfrak{P}} \\cong S_3$. We need to find the order of $[S_3, S_3]$.\nThe commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ of a group $G$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators $[g,h] = ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ for $g,h \\in G$.\nFor $G=S_3$, let's compute the commutator of our generators $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$:\n$[\\sigma, \\tau] = \\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1}\\tau^{-1} = (\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1})\\tau^{-1} = \\tau^{-1}\\tau^{-1} = \\tau^{-2} = \\tau$.\nSince $\\tau$ is an element of the commutator subgroup $[S_3, S_3]$, the entire cyclic subgroup generated by $\\tau$ must be contained in $[S_3, S_3]$. That is, $\\langle \\tau \\rangle \\subseteq [S_3, S_3]$.\nThe subgroup $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$ is isomorphic to $A_3$ and has order $3$.\nFurthermore, the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$ is the smallest normal subgroup of $G$ such that the quotient $G/[G,G]$ (the abelianization of $G$) is abelian.\nThe quotient group $S_3/\\langle \\tau \\rangle \\cong S_3/A_3 \\cong C_2$ is abelian.

Treat $f_{2}$ as a quadratic in $y = x^{2}$ to compute its discriminant in $\\mathbb{Q}[y]$, and use resolvent considerations to explicitly describe generators for the quadratic subfields of $L$. Conclude that $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order $8$.\n3. Using the decomposition group and Frobenius element framework, explain how the factorization patterns of $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ modulo an unramified prime $p$ encode the cycle types of Frobenius in $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ and $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, respectively. In particular, identify the conjugacy-class data corresponding to:\n   - $f_{1} \\bmod p$ factoring as a product of one linear factor and one irreducible quadratic factor over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\n   - $f_{2} \\bmod p$ factoring as a product of two irreducible quadratic factors over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\n4. Show that $K$ and $L$ are linearly disjoint over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and hence that the Frobenius classes in $\\operatorname{Gal}(KL/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ equidistribute independently according to Chebotarev. Then compute the Dirichlet density of rational primes $p$ unramified in both $K$ and $L$ for which simultaneously:\n   - $f_{1} \\bmod p$ factors as one linear factor times one irreducible quadratic factor over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$, and\n   - $f_{2} \\bmod p$ factors as a product of two irreducible quadratic factors over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$.\n\nGive your final answer as a single reduced fraction. No rounding is required. Do not include any units.", "solution": "We will address the four parts of the problem sequentially.\n\n**1. Analysis of $f_{1}(x)$ and $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$**\n\nLet $f_{1}(x) = x^{3} - x - 1$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ as it has no rational roots (by the Rational Root Theorem, the only candidates are $\\pm 1$, neither of which is a root).\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible cubic polynomial is either the symmetric group $S_{3}$ or the alternating group $A_{3} \\cong C_{3}$. The specific group is determined by the discriminant of the polynomial. For a depressed cubic of the form $x^{3} + ax + b$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -4a^{3} - 27b^{2}$. For $f_{1}(x)$, we have $a = -1$ and $b = -1$.\n\nThe discriminant of $f_{1}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta_{1} = -4(-1)^{3} - 27(-1)^{2} = -4(-1) - 27(1) = 4 - 27 = -23 $$\nThe Galois group is $A_{3}$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\Delta_{1} = -23$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group must be the full symmetric group.\nThus, if $K$ is the splitting field of $f_{1}(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we have $\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_{3}$. The order of this group is $|S_{3}|=6$. The unique quadratic subfield of $K$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_{1}}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23})$.\n\n**2. Analysis of $f_{2}(x)$ and $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$**\n\nLet $f_{2}(x) = x^{4} - 2x^{2} + 2$. This polynomial can be shown to be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $y=x^{2}$, so we have the quadratic $y^{2}-2y+2=0$, whose roots are $y = 1 \\pm i$. The roots of $f_{2}(x)$ are therefore $\\pm\\sqrt{1+i}$ and $\\pm\\sqrt{1-i}$, and the splitting field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{1+i}, \\sqrt{1-i})$.\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial $x^4+px^2+q$ is $z^3-pz^2-4qz+4pq=0$. For $f_2(x)$, with $p=-2, q=2$, this is $z^3+2z^2-8z-16=0$, which factors as $(z+2)(z^2-8)=0$. The roots are $-2, \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since there is exactly one rational root, the Galois group $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to either $D_8$ or $C_4$.\n\nThese two groups can be distinguished by the number of quadratic subfields in the splitting field $L$. A $C_4$ extension has a unique quadratic subfield, while a $D_8$ extension has three. The quadratic subfields of the splitting field of an irreducible $x^4+px^2+q$ are generated by $\\sqrt{q}$, $\\sqrt{p^2-4q}$, and $\\sqrt{q(p^2-4q)}$. For $f_2(x)$, these are:\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{(-2)^2-4(2)}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-8}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$\n- $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2(-8)}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-16}) = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$\nSince these three fields are distinct, $L$ contains three quadratic subfields. This confirms that the Galois group must be the dihedral group of order 8. So, $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong D_{8}$. The generators for the three quadratic subfields can be taken as $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{-2}$, and $i$.\n\n**3. Factorization Patterns and Frobenius Elements**\n\nFor a prime $p$ unramified in a number field, the Frobenius element $\\operatorname{Frob}_{p}$ acts as a permutation on the roots of the defining polynomial. The cycle structure of this permutation corresponds to the degrees of the irreducible factors of the polynomial modulo $p$.\n\nFor $f_{1}(x)$ and $G_{1} = \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_{3}$:\nThe group $S_{3}$ has 3 conjugacy classes, corresponding to cycle structures:\n- $(1,1,1)$: identity element, size $1$. Corresponds to $f_{1} \\pmod p$ splitting into three linear factors.\n- $(1,2)$: transpositions, size $3$. Corresponds to $f_{1} \\pmod p$ factoring into one linear and one irreducible quadratic factor.\n- $(3)$: $3$-cycles, size $2$. Corresponds to $f_{1} \\pmod p$ being irreducible.\nThe first condition of the problem, $f_{1} \\pmod p$ factoring as (linear)(quadratic), corresponds to $\\operatorname{Frob}_{p}$ for $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ being in the conjugacy class of transpositions in $S_{3}$. This class contains $3$ elements.\n\nFor $f_{2}(x)$ and $G_{2} = \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong D_{8}$:\nThe group $D_{8}$ can be viewed as a subgroup of $S_{4}$. It has $5$ conjugacy classes, and the cycle structures of its elements as permutations of the 4 roots are:\n- $\\{id\\}$: size $1$, cycle type $(1,1,1,1)$. $f_{2} \\pmod p$ splits completely.\n- $\\{r, r^{3}\\}$: size $2$, cycle type $(4)$. $f_{2} \\pmod p$ is irreducible.\n- $\\{s, r^{2}s\\}$: size $2$, cycle type $(1,1,2)$. $f_{2} \\pmod p$ has two linear factors and one quadratic factor.\n- $\\{r^{2}\\}$: size $1$, cycle type $(2,2)$. $f_{2} \\pmod p$ factors into two irreducible quadratics.\n- $\\{rs, r^{3}s\\}$: size $2$, cycle type $(2,2)$. $f_{2} \\pmod p$ also factors into two irreducible quadratics.\nThe second condition of the problem, $f_{2} \\pmod p$ factoring as a product of two irreducible quadratics, corresponds to $\\operatorname{Frob}_{p}$ for $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ having cycle structure $(2,2)$. The elements in $D_{8}$ with this structure belong to two distinct conjugacy classes: one of size $1$ and one of size $2$. In total, there are $1+2=3$ such elements.\n\n**4. Linear Disjointness and Density Calculation**\n\nTwo Galois extensions $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are linearly disjoint if $K \\cap L = \\mathbb{Q}$. A common subfield must have a degree dividing both $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=6$ and $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$. The greatest common divisor is $\\gcd(6,8)=2$. Thus, any non-trivial common subfield must be quadratic.\nThe unique quadratic subfield of $K$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23})$.\nThe quadratic subfields of $L$ are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\nFor two fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_{1}})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_{2}})$ to be equal (with $d_1, d_2$ square-free integers), we must have $d_{1}=d_{2}$. Clearly, $-23$ is not equal to $2$, $-2$, or $-1$. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23})$ is not any of the quadratic subfields of $L$.\nTherefore, $K \\cap L = \\mathbb{Q}$, and the fields are linearly disjoint.\n\nThis implies that the Galois group of the composite field $KL$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$$ \\operatorname{Gal}(KL/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_{3} \\times D_{8} $$\nThe order of this group is $|S_{3} \\times D_{8}| = |S_{3}| \\cdot |D_{8}| = 6 \\cdot 8 = 48$. The Frobenius element $\\operatorname{Frob}_{p}$ in $S_{3} \\times D_{8}$ is a pair $(\\sigma, \\tau)$, where $\\sigma$ is the Frobenius for $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\tau$ is the Frobenius for $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nBy the Chebotarev density theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which $\\operatorname{Frob}_{p}$ lies in a certain collection of conjugacy classes $C$ is $|C|/|G|$. Since the extensions are linearly disjoint, the factorization patterns modulo $p$ for $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are independent events.\nThe density of primes $p$ for which $f_{1} \\pmod p$ factors as (linear)(quadratic) is the proportion of elements in $S_{3}$ that are transpositions:\n$$ d_{1} = \\frac{|\\text{class of transpositions}|}{|S_{3}|} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe density of primes $p$ for which $f_{2} \\pmod p$ factors as (quadratic)(quadratic) is the proportion of elements in $D_{8}$ with cycle structure $(2,2)$:\n$$ d_{2} = \\frac{3}{|D_{8}|} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nThe density of primes for which both conditions hold simultaneously is the product of their individual densities. The set of ramified primes is a finite set which does not affect the Dirichlet density.\n$$ d = d_{1} \\times d_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3}{16} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$$", "id": "3025579"}]}
