It consists of a standard set of tasks in algebraic number theory. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe quadratic number field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{34})$. We are asked to perform a series of tasks related to its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and its group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$.\n\n1. Identification of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and the Field Norm\n\nFor a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is determined by the value of $d$ modulo $4$. In our case, $d=34$. Since $34$ is not divisible by any perfect square other than $1$, it is square-free. We check its congruence class: $34 = 4 \\times 8 + 2$, so $34 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nFor cases where $d \\equiv 2$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is given by $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$. Therefore, for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{34})$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{34}] = \\{x+y\\sqrt{34} \\mid x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nAn arbitrary element $\\alpha \\in K$ can be written as $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{34}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ is defined by the product of the element and its Galois conjugate. The conjugate of $\\alpha$ is $\\overline{\\alpha} = a-b\\sqrt{34}$.\nThe norm is thus $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\overline{\\alpha} = (a+b\\sqrt{34})(a-b\\sqrt{34}) = a^2 - 34b^2$.\nFor an element $x+y\\sqrt{34} \\in K$ (where $x,y$ are generally in $\\mathbb{Q}$, but specifically in $\\mathbb{Z}$ if the element is in $\\mathcal{O}_K$), the norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x+y\\sqrt{34}) = x^2 - 34y^2$.\n\n2. Continued Fraction Expansion and Pell's Equation\n\nTo find the fundamental unit of $\\mathcal{O}_K$, we study the solutions to the Pell-type equation $x^2 - 34y^2 = \\pm 1$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The minimal positive integer solution $(x,y)$ to this equation is found via the simple continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{34}$. We compute this expansion using the standard algorithm. Let $\\xi_0 = \\sqrt{34}$.\n\n$a_0 = \\lfloor\\sqrt{34}\\rfloor = 5$, since $5^2 = 25$ and $6^2 = 36$.\n$\\xi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}-5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+5}{34-25} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+5}{9}$.\n$a_1 = \\lfloor\\xi_1\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{5+\\sqrt{34}}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{5+5.83\\dots}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.20\\dots \\rfloor = 1$.\n\n$\\xi_2 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{34}+5}{9}-1} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{34}-4} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{34-16} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{18} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{2}$.\n$a_2 = \\lfloor\\xi_2\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+\\sqrt{34}}{2}\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+5.83\\dots}{2}\\rfloor = \\lfloor 4.91\\dots \\rfloor = 4$.\n\n$\\xi_3 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{2}-4} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{34}-4} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{34-16} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{34}+4)}{18} = \\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{9}$.\n$a_3 = \\lfloor\\xi_3\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+\\sqrt{34}}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor\\frac{4+5.83\\dots}{9}\\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.09\\dots \\rfloor = 1$.\n\n$\\xi_4 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{34}+4}{9}-1} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{34}-5} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+5)}{34-25} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{34}+5)}{9} = \\sqrt{34}+5$.\n$a_4 = \\lfloor\\sqrt{34}+5\\rfloor = 5+5 = 10$.\n\n$\\xi_5 = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{34}+5)-10} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}-5} = \\xi_1$.\nSince $\\xi_5=\\xi_1$, the sequence of partial quotients $a_i$ is periodic from $a_1$ onwards. The continued fraction expansion of $\\sqrt{34}$ is $[5; \\overline{1, 4, 1, 10}]$. The length of the period is $k=4$.\n\nThe fundamental solution to $x^2 - 34y^2 = (-1)^k$ is given by the numerator $p_{k-1}$ and denominator $q_{k-1}$ of the $(k-1)$-th convergent of this expansion. Here $k=4$, so we need the $3$rd convergent, $p_3/q_3$. We calculate the convergents using the recurrence relations $p_n = a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}$ and $q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}$, with initial values $p_{-2}=0, p_{-1}=1$ and $q_{-2}=1, q_{-1}=0$.\n\n$a_0=5: \\quad p_0 = 5(1)+0=5, \\quad q_0=5(0)+1=1$.\n$a_1=1: \\quad p_1 = 1(5)+1=6, \\quad q_1=1(1)+0=1$.\n$a_2=4: \\quad p_2 = 4(6)+5=29, \\quad q_2=4(1)+1=5$.\n$a_3=1: \\quad p_3 = 1(29)+6=35, \\quad q_3=1(5)+1=6$.\n\nThe convergent is $p_3/q_3 = 35/6$. This gives the candidate solution $(x,y)=(35,6)$. We check this in the associated Pell-type equation. Since the period length $k=4$ is even, we expect this solution to satisfy $x^2-34y^2=1$:\n$35^2 - 34(6^2) = 1225 - 34(36) = 1225 - 1224 = 1$.\nThe equation is satisfied. The pair $(x,y)=(35,6)$ is the minimal positive integer solution to $x^2 - 34y^2 = 1$.\n\n3. Construction of a Unit and Analysis via Dirichlet's Unit Theorem\n\nAn element $\\epsilon \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unit if its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\epsilon)$ is $\\pm 1$. The solution $(x,y)=(35,6)$ found in part 2 gives us the element $\\epsilon = 35+6\\sqrt{34}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{34}]$. Its norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\epsilon) = 35^2 - 34(6^2) = 1$. As its norm is $1$, $\\epsilon$ is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$.\n\nWe now explain from first principles why the subgroup $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle = \\{\\epsilon^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ has a finite index in the full group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$. The argument relies on the Dirichlet Unit Theorem.\n\nThe theorem states that for a number field $K$, the group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is a finitely generated abelian group with structure $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} \\cong \\mu(K) \\times \\mathbb{Z}^r$, where $\\mu(K)$ is the finite group of roots of unity in $K$ and $r$ is the rank. The rank is given by $r = r_1+r_2-1$, where $r_1$ is the number of real embeddings of $K$ and $r_2$ is the number of conjugate pairs of complex embeddings.\n\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{34})$, since $340$, it is a real quadratic field. It has two distinct real embeddings into $\\mathbb{C}$: $\\sigma_1(a+b\\sqrt{34}) = a+b\\sqrt{34}$ and $\\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{34}) = a-b\\sqrt{34}$. Both map into $\\mathbb{R}$, so $r_1=2$ and $r_2=0$. The rank of the unit group is $r = 2+0-1 = 1$. The roots of unity in a real quadratic field are only $\\{1, -1\\}$, so $\\mu(K) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$.\nThus, the structure of the unit group is $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} \\cong \\{\\pm 1\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies the existence of a fundamental unit $\\epsilon_1  1$ such that any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ can be uniquely written in the form $u = \\pm \\epsilon_1^n$ for some integer $n$.\n\nThe connection to this structure is made via the logarithmic embedding $L: K^{\\times} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{r_1+r_2}$. For our field, $L: K^{\\times} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by $L(\\alpha) = (\\ln|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|, \\ln|\\sigma_2(\\alpha)|)$. For any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$, we have $N(u) = \\sigma_1(u)\\sigma_2(u) = \\pm 1$. Taking absolute values, $|\\sigma_1(u)||\\sigma_2(u)| = 1$. Applying the natural logarithm, we get $\\ln|\\sigma_1(u)| + \\ln|\\sigma_2(u)| = 0$. This shows that the image of the units, $L(\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times})$, is contained in the $1$-dimensional subspace (a line) $H = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1+x_2 = 0\\}$.\n\nThe Dirichlet Unit Theorem further specifies that $L(\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times})$ is a lattice of rank $r=1$ in this subspace $H$. A rank-$1$ lattice is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}\\mathbf{v}$ for some basis vector $\\mathbf{v}$. This basis vector is the image of the fundamental unit, $\\mathbf{v} = L(\\epsilon_1)$.\nThe kernel of the logarithmic map restricted to $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times$ consists of units $u$ with $|\\sigma_i(u)|=1$ for all $i$. These are precisely the roots of unity, so $\\ker(L|_{\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times}) = \\mu(K) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n\nThe theory of continued fractions ensures that for $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ with $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, the unit $\\epsilon = x+y\\sqrt{d}$ constructed from the minimal positive integer solution to $x^2-dy^2=1$ is precisely the fundamental unit $\\epsilon_1  1$. In our case, $\\epsilon = 35+6\\sqrt{34}$ is the fundamental unit.\nThus, $L(\\epsilon)$ is a generator for the lattice $L(\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times})$. This means that for any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$, its image $L(u)$ must be an integer multiple of $L(\\epsilon)$, i.e., $L(u) = nL(\\epsilon)$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis implies $L(u) - L(\\epsilon^n) = L(u/\\epsilon^n) = \\mathbf{0}$. An element whose image under $L$ is the zero vector must be in the kernel of $L$, which is $\\{\\pm 1\\}$. So, $u/\\epsilon^n = \\pm 1$, which means $u = \\pm \\epsilon^n$.\nThis confirms that every unit is of the form $\\pm \\epsilon^n$. The group of units is $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times = \\{\\pm \\epsilon^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The subgroup generated by $\\epsilon$ is $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle = \\{\\epsilon^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\nThe quotient group $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} / \\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$ has elements which are the cosets $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$ and $(-\\epsilon)\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$, which is just $\\{1\\cdot\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle, -1\\cdot\\langle\\epsilon\\rangle\\}$. This quotient group is isomorphic to $\\{\\pm 1\\}$. The index of the subgroup $\\langle \\epsilon \\rangle$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is the order of this quotient group, which is $|\\{\\pm 1\\}|=2$. Since the index is $2$, it is finite.\n\n4.

The tasks of computing a norm and finding a fundamental unit are well-defined mathematical operations within this context. The problem references known theoretical results (e.g., that the index of circular units in the full unit group of $K^+$ is the class number of $K^+$, which is $1$ for $n=9$), making the request to find a fundamental unit from circular units feasible and meaningful. No flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. We will address them in order.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_9)$**\n\nThe field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)$ is the $9^{th}$ cyclotomic field. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\phi(9) = 9(1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = 6$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_9$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the $9^{th}$ cyclotomic polynomial, $\\Phi_9(x)$.\n$$ \\Phi_9(x) = \\frac{x^9 - 1}{x^3 - 1} = x^6 + x^3 + 1 $$\nThe roots of $\\Phi_9(x)$ are the primitive $9^{th}$ roots of unity, which are $\\zeta_9^a$ for $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The set of exponents is $\\{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}$. So, we can write $\\Phi_9(x)$ as:\n$$ \\Phi_9(x) = \\prod_{a \\in \\{1,2,4,5,7,8\\}} (x - \\zeta_9^a) $$\nThe embeddings $\\sigma: K \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ are determined by the automorphisms of $K$, which are given by $\\sigma_a: \\zeta_9 \\mapsto \\zeta_9^a$ for $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nThe norm of an element $\\alpha \\in K$ is the product of its Galois conjugates. For $\\alpha = 1 - \\zeta_9$, the conjugates are $\\sigma_a(1 - \\zeta_9) = 1 - \\sigma_a(\\zeta_9) = 1 - \\zeta_9^a$.\nThus, the norm is:\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_9) = \\prod_{a \\in \\{1,2,4,5,7,8\\}} \\sigma_a(1 - \\zeta_9) = \\prod_{a \\in \\{1,2,4,5,7,8\\}} (1 - \\zeta_9^a) $$\nThis product is precisely the value of the cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_9(x)$ evaluated at $x = 1$.\n$$ N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(1 - \\zeta_9) = \\Phi_9(1) = 1^6 + 1^3 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\nThis result aligns with the general theorem that for $n=p^k$ where $p$ is a prime, $N_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q}}(1-\\zeta_n) = \\Phi_n(1) = p$. Here, $n=9=3^2$, so the norm is $3$.\n\n**Part 2: Construction of a fundamental unit of $K^{+}$**\n\nThe field $K^{+}$ is the maximal real subfield of $K$, given by $K^{+} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1})$. Let $\\eta = \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1} = 2\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{9})$. The degree of this field over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[K^+:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{\\phi(9)}{2} = 3$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\eta$ can be derived from the minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_9$. We have $\\zeta_9^6 + \\zeta_9^3 + 1 = 0$. Dividing by $\\zeta_9^3$ yields $\\zeta_9^3 + 1 + \\zeta_9^{-3} = 0$.\nThe powers of $\\eta$ are:\n$\\eta = \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}$\n$\\eta^2 = \\zeta_9^2 + 2 + \\zeta_9^{-2}$\n$\\eta^3 = \\zeta_9^3 + 3\\zeta_9 + 3\\zeta_9^{-1} + \\zeta_9^{-3} = (\\zeta_9^3 + \\zeta_9^{-3}) + 3(\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) = -1 + 3\\eta$.\nThus, the minimal polynomial for $\\eta$ is $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe problem directs us to construct a unit from circular units. The circular units of $K$ are generated by elements of the form $\\varepsilon_a = \\frac{1-\\zeta_9^a}{1-\\zeta_9}$ for $a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. For $a$ coprime to $n$, the ideal $(1-\\zeta_n^a)$ is the same as $(1-\\zeta_n)$, so their ratio is a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nLet's choose a simple generator, taking $a=2$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_2 = \\frac{1 - \\zeta_9^2}{1 - \\zeta_9} = 1 + \\zeta_9 $$\nThis is a unit in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)$. To obtain a unit in the real subfield $K^+$, we project $\\varepsilon_2$ from $K$ to $K^+$ by taking its norm, $N_{K/K^+}$. The non-trivial Galois automorphism of $K/K^+$ is complex conjugation, $\\sigma_{-1}: \\zeta_9 \\mapsto \\zeta_9^{-1}$.\n$$ u = N_{K/K^+}(\\varepsilon_2) = \\varepsilon_2 \\cdot \\sigma_{-1}(\\varepsilon_2) = (1 + \\zeta_9)(1 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) $$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$$ u = 1 + \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1} + \\zeta_9 \\zeta_9^{-1} = 1 + (\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) + 1 = 2 + (\\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}) $$\nExpressed in terms of our generator $\\eta$ for $K^+$, the unit is $u = 2 + \\eta$.\n\nTo confirm $u$ is a unit, we compute its norm in $K^+/\\mathbb{Q}$: $N_{K^+/\\mathbb{Q}}(u) = N_{K^+/\\mathbb{Q}}(2+\\eta)$. This is related to the minimal polynomial $f(x)=x^3-3x+1$ of $\\eta$. The norm of an element $\\alpha - \\beta$ is $N(\\alpha - \\beta) = (-1)^{\\text{deg}} f(\\beta)$, so $N(2+\\eta) = N(\\eta - (-2)) = (-1)^3 f(-2)$.\n$$ N_{K^+/\\mathbb{Q}}(2+\\eta) = -((-2)^3 - 3(-2) + 1) = -(-8 + 6 + 1) = -(-1) = 1 $$\nSince its norm is $1$, $u=2+\\zeta_9+\\zeta_9^{-1}$ is indeed a unit in $\\mathcal{O}_{K^+}$.\n\nFinally, we must justify that this is a fundamental unit. By Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the rank of the unit group of $K^+$ is $r_1+r_2-1$, where $r_1=3$ is the number of real embeddings and $r_2=0$ is the number of complex embeddings. The rank is $3+0-1=2$. A set of fundamental units will be a basis of two elements for the free part of the unit group.\nA major result in the theory of cyclotomic fields (Washington's theorem) states that the index of the group of circular units in the full group of units of $K^+$ is equal to the class number $h_{K^+}$ of $K^+$. For $n=9$, it is known that $h_9^+=1$. This means the circular units generate the entire unit group $\\mathcal{O}_{K^+}^\\times$. The unit $u=2+\\zeta_9+\\zeta_9^{-1}$ we constructed is one of the standard generators for the group of circular units. Therefore, it can be chosen as part of a basis for the unit group, which makes it a fundamental unit.\n\nThus, an explicit fundamental unit is $2 + \\zeta_9 + \\zeta_9^{-1}$.\nThe final answer is composed of the norm and this unit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3  2+\\zeta_9+\\zeta_9^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3030628"}, {"introduction": "After constructing candidate units, as we did in the previous practices [@problem_id:3030585] [@problem_id:3030628], a crucial question remains: do these units form a fundamental set?

This means $\\log|\\sigma_i(u)|=0$ for all real embeddings $\\sigma_i$, and $2\\log|\\tau_j(u)|=0$ for all complex embeddings $\\tau_j$. This is equivalent to $|\\sigma_i(u)|=1$ and $|\\tau_j(u)|=1$ for all $i,j$. A unit whose all conjugates have absolute value $1$ is a root of unity (by a theorem of Kronecker). So, $\\ker(\\lambda) = W_K$, the group of roots of unity in $K$.\n*   **The connection:** The units $u_1, \\dots, u_m$ are multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if and only if their images under the logarithmic map, $\\lambda(u_1), \\dots, \\lambda(u_m)$, are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Z}$.

This is $\\log|\\prod_\\rho \\rho(u)| = \\log|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u)|$. Since $u$ is a unit, its norm is $\\pm 1$, so $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u)|=1$. Thus $\\log|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u)| = \\log(1) = 0$. This confirms that $\\lambda(u)$ lies in the hyperplane $H$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\nThe problem asks for a criterion to determine if a set of units $\\{u_1, \\dots, u_m\\}$ from the unit group $E_K$ of a number field $K$ are multiplicatively independent modulo the group of roots of unity $W_K$.\n\nA set of units $\\{u_1, \\dots, u_m\\}$ is multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if an equation of the form $u_1^{a_1} \\cdots u_m^{a_m} = \\zeta$, where $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\zeta \\in W_K$, implies that $a_1 = \\dots = a_m = 0$.\n\nThe logarithmic embedding $\\lambda: E_K \\to \\mathbb{R}^{r_1+r_2}$ is a group homomorphism. Its kernel consists of units $u$ for which $\\lambda(u) = \\mathbf{0}$. This condition, $\\log|\\rho(u)| = 0$ for all embeddings $\\rho$, implies $|\\rho(u)|=1$ for all $\\rho$. A theorem by Kronecker states that an algebraic integer all of whose conjugates have absolute value 1 must be a root of unity. Therefore, $\\ker(\\lambda) = W_K$.\n\nApplying $\\lambda$ to the equation $u_1^{a_1} \\cdots u_m^{a_m} = \\zeta$, we get:\n$$ \\lambda(u_1^{a_1} \\cdots u_m^{a_m}) = \\lambda(\\zeta) $$\n$$ a_1\\lambda(u_1) + \\cdots + a_m\\lambda(u_m) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe multiplicative independence of $\\{u_1, \\dots, u_m\\}$ modulo $W_K$ is thus equivalent to the linear independence of the vectors $\\{\\lambda(u_1), \\dots, \\lambda(u_m)\\}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$, and hence over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe problem defines the matrix $M$ as the $(r_1+r_2) \\times m$ matrix whose columns are the vectors $\\lambda(u_1), \\dots, \\lambda(u_m)$. The set of these column vectors is linearly independent if and only if the matrix $M$ has rank $m$. The rank of a matrix is defined as the size of its largest non-zero minor. Therefore, the rank of $M$ is $m$ if and only if there exists an $m \\times m$ submatrix of $M$ (an $m \\times m$ minor) with a non-zero determinant. This establishes the fundamental determinant-based criterion.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on this principle.\n\n**A. The units $u_1,\\dots,u_m$ are multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if and only if the matrix $M$ has column rank $m$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{r_1 + r_2}$; equivalently, when $m = r$, at least one $r \\times r$ minor of $M$ has nonzero determinant. The weight $2$ on complex embeddings is essential in the definition of $\\lambda$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The first part, \"if and only if the matrix $M$ has column rank $m$\", is precisely the conclusion derived above. The equivalence for the case $m=r$, \"at least one $r \\times r$ minor of $M$ has nonzero determinant,\" is a direct application of the definition of rank for a matrix whose number of columns equals the rank. The final sentence regarding the weight $2$ is also correct in the context of the standard formulation of algebraic number theory. This factor ensures that the sum of the components of $\\lambda(u)$ is $\\log|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(u)|$, which is $0$ for a unit, placing the image in the hyperplane $H$. This property is foundational for the definition of the regulator and its role in the class number formula. While a test for independence could be constructed without this factor (see B), the factor is essential to the canonical definition of $\\lambda$ and its theoretical properties.\n\n**B. The units $u_1,\\dots,u_m$ are multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if and only if the matrix defined exactly as in the statement for $M$ but without the factor $2$ on complex embeddings has column rank $m$; equivalently, when $m = r$, at least one $r \\times r$ minor of that matrix has nonzero determinant.**\n\nLet $\\lambda'$ be the embedding without the factor of $2$. A linear combination $\\sum_{j=1}^m c_j \\lambda(u_j) = \\mathbf{0}$ is equivalent to $\\sum_{j=1}^m c_j \\lambda'(u_j) = \\mathbf{0}$. This is because the components of $\\lambda(u)$ are either identical to or twice the components of $\\lambda'(u)$. Thus, the linear independence of $\\{\\lambda(u_j)\\}$ is equivalent to the linear independence of $\\{\\lambda'(u_j)\\}$. So, this statement also describes a mathematically valid test. However, the problem explicitly defines the matrix $M$ using the standard map $\\lambda$ and asks for a criterion. Option A provides this criterion for $M$. Option B provides a criterion for a different matrix $M'$, which is not the one defined in the problem's setup. Therefore, A is a more direct and appropriate answer to the question as posed.\n\n**C. The units $u_1,\\dots,u_r$ are multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if and only if the determinant of the full $(r_1 + r_2) \\times r$ matrix $M$ is nonzero.**\n\nThe matrix $M$ is of size $(r_1+r_2) \\times r$. Since $r = r_1+r_2-1$, the matrix $M$ is an $(r+1) \\times r$ matrix. A non-square matrix does not have a determinant. This statement is mathematically meaningless.\n\n**D. If $m = r$, then $u_1,\\dots,u_r$ are multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if and only if, after deleting any one row of $M$ to obtain an $r \\times r$ square matrix, the determinant of that square matrix is nonzero.**\n\nThis statement concerns the special case $m=r$. Because the image of $\\lambda$ lies in the hyperplane $H$, the sum of the rows of the matrix $M$ is the zero vector. A key property that follows from this is that if the rank of the $(r+1) \\times r$ matrix $M$ is $r$, then any $r \\times r$ submatrix formed by deleting a single row has a non-zero determinant. Conversely, if any such submatrix has a non-zero determinant, the rank is $r$. So the mathematical content of the statement is correct for the case $m=r$. However, the problem asks for a general criterion for $m \\le r$. This option fails to provide a criterion for $m  r$ and is therefore not general.\n\n**E. It is sufficient to restrict to the complex embeddings: $u_1,\\dots,u_m$ are multiplicatively independent modulo torsion if and only if, upon taking only the $r_2$ rows corresponding to complex embeddings (with the weight $2$), the resulting $r_2 \\times m$ matrix has column rank $m$; equivalently, when $m = r_2$, at least one $r_2 \\times r_2$ minor has nonzero determinant.**\n\nThis statement is false. It claims that the real embeddings can be ignored. Consider a number field $K$ with $r_10$ and $r_2  0$. We can choose $m$ such that $r_2  m \\le r$. For example, if $K$ is the splitting field of $x^4-x-1$, we have $r_1=2, r_2=1$, so $r=2$. Dirichlet's theorem guarantees the existence of $m=2$ multiplicatively independent units. Option E's criterion would involve checking if a $r_2 \\times m = 1 \\times 2$ matrix has rank $m=2$, which is impossible. Thus, the criterion fails. More generally, there is no reason why linear dependence in the full log-vectors should be detectable by only looking at the components from complex embeddings.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides a criterion that is correct, based on the standard definitions provided in the problem, and general for all allowed values of $m$. The other options are either mathematically incorrect (C, E), not general enough (D), or refer to a non-standard construction not defined in the problem context (B).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3030625"}]}
