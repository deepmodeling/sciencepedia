The validation process confirms the problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information. We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic number field, where $d$ is a squarefree integer not equal to $1$. An element $\\alpha \\in K$ is an algebraic integer if its minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has integer coefficients. Any element $\\alpha \\in K$ can be written as $\\alpha = a + b\\sqrt{d}$ for unique $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ (if $b \\neq 0$) is given by\n$$ (x - \\alpha)(x - \\sigma(\\alpha)) = x^2 - (\\alpha + \\sigma(\\alpha))x + \\alpha\\sigma(\\alpha) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the non-trivial automorphism of $K$ that sends $\\sqrt{d}$ to $-\\sqrt{d}$. The two coefficients are the trace and norm of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha + \\sigma(\\alpha) = (a+b\\sqrt{d}) + (a-b\\sqrt{d}) = 2a $$\n$$ \\operatorname{N}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\sigma(\\alpha) = (a+b\\sqrt{d})(a-b\\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2 $$\nFor $\\alpha$ to be an algebraic integer, its trace and norm must be integers. Thus, we require:\n$1$. $2a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n$2$. $a^2 - db^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nLet $m = 2a$, so $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a = \\frac{m}{2}$. Substituting this into the norm condition gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{2}\\right)^2 - db^2 = \\frac{m^2}{4} - db^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nMultiplying by $4$ gives $m^2 - 4db^2 \\in 4\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $b = \\frac{n}{k}$ with $n,k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $k0$, and $\\gcd(n,k)=1$. The condition becomes $m^2 - 4d\\frac{n^2}{k^2} \\in 4\\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $k^2$ must divide $4dn^2$. Since $\\gcd(n,k)=1$, $k^2$ must divide $4d$. Since $d$ is squarefree, any prime factor of $k$ other than $2$ can appear at most to the first power in $d$, so it cannot appear to the second power in $k^2$. This forces $k$ to be either $1$ or $2$.\nSo, $b$ must be of the form $\\frac{j}{2}$ for some integer $j$. Let's write $\\alpha = \\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{j}{2}\\sqrt{d} = \\frac{m+j\\sqrt{d}}{2}$.\nThe norm condition $a^2-db^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ becomes $(\\frac{m}{2})^2 - d(\\frac{j}{2})^2 = \\frac{m^2-dj^2}{4} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis requires $m^2 - dj^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, where $m,j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe analyze this congruence based on the value of $d$ modulo $4$:\nCase I: $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ or $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe squares modulo $4$ are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 0$, $3^2 \\equiv 1$.\nIf $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, the congruence is $m^2 - 2j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. If $j$ is odd ($j^2 \\equiv 1$), then $m^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, which is impossible. Thus $j$ must be even, $j=2k$. Then $m^2 - 2(4k^2) \\equiv m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, which implies $m$ must be even, $m=2l$. So, $\\alpha = \\frac{2l+2k\\sqrt{d}}{2} = l+k\\sqrt{d}$ with $l,k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ and an integral basis is $\\{1, \\sqrt{d}\\}$.\nIf $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the congruence is $m^2 - 3j^2 \\equiv m^2+j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. If $j$ is odd ($j^2 \\equiv 1$), then $m^2 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, which is impossible. Thus $j$ must be even. As before, this implies $m$ must also be even. The ring of integers is again $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ with basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{d}\\}$.\n\nCase II: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe congruence is $m^2 - j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. This condition holds if and only if $m$ and $j$ have the same parity ($m \\equiv j \\pmod{2}$).\nIf $m, j$ are both even, $m=2l, j=2k$, then $\\alpha = l+k\\sqrt{d}$, an element of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$.\nIf $m, j$ are both odd, $m=2l+1, j=2k+1$, then $\\alpha = \\frac{(2l+1)+(2k+1)\\sqrt{d}}{2} = l+k\\sqrt{d} + \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$.\nAll algebraic integers in $K$ can be expressed as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $1$ and $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$.\nThe element $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ is itself an integer, as its minimal polynomial is $x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4} = 0$, and since $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $(1-d)/4$ is an integer. Thus, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$, and an integral basis is $\\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\}$.\n\nNow we analyze the four given fields:\n- For $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, we have $d=5$. Since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, this is Case II. An integral basis is $\\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\}$.\n- For $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$, we have $d=13$. Since $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, this is Case II. An integral basis is $\\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\}$.\n- For $K_3 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we have $d=-3$. Since $-3 = 4(-1) + 1$, we have $-3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This is Case II. An integral basis is $\\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\}$.\n- For $K_4 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$, we have $d=-7$. Since $-7 = 4(-2) + 1$, we have $-7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This is Case II. An integral basis is $\\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-7}}{2}\\}$.\n\nAll four fields fall under Case II. We now compute the field discriminant $D_K$ for the general case $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, using the integral basis $\\{\\beta_1, \\beta_2\\} = \\{1, \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\}$. The discriminant is defined as $D_{K} = \\det(\\operatorname{Tr}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\beta_{i}\\beta_{j}))$. We compute the entries of the matrix:\n- $\\beta_1^2 = 1^2 = 1$. $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_1^2) = \\operatorname{Tr}(1) = \\operatorname{Tr}(1+0\\sqrt{d}) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n- $\\beta_1\\beta_2 = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$. $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_1\\beta_2) = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{d}) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n- $\\beta_2\\beta_1 = \\beta_1\\beta_2$, so $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_2\\beta_1) = 1$.\n- $\\beta_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{d}+d}{4} = \\frac{1+d}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{d}$.\n$\\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_2^2) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1+d}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{d}\\right) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1+d}{4} = \\frac{1+d}{2}$.\n\nThe matrix of traces is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_1^2)  \\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_1\\beta_2) \\\\ \\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_2\\beta_1)  \\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta_2^2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 1  \\frac{1+d}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe discriminant is the determinant of this matrix:\n$$ D_K = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 1  \\frac{1+d}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = (2)\\left(\\frac{1+d}{2}\\right) - (1)(1) = (1+d) - 1 = d. $$\nSo for any quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the field discriminant is $D_K = d$.\n\nWe apply this result to find the discriminant for each specific field:\n- For $K_1=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ with $d=5$: $D_{K_1}=5$.\n- For $K_2=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$ with $d=13$: $D_{K_2}=13$.\n- For $K_3=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ with $d=-3$: $D_{K_3}=-3$.\n- For $K_4=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$ with $d=-7$: $D_{K_4}=-7$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix of these discriminants in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5  13  -3  -7 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3010135"}, {"introduction": "Minkowski's bound provides a powerful gateway to computing the class group by limiting the search space for ideal class generators.

We follow the specified sequence of steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the fundamental parameters of the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=53$. Since $d=53$ is a square-free integer, we check its residue modulo $4$. We have $53 = 4 \\times 13 + 1$, so $53 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. For a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, the absolute discriminant is $D_{K} = d$ and the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right]$.

As $53  0$, $K$ is a real quadratic field, which means it has $r_1=2$ real embeddings and $r_2=0$ pairs of complex embeddings. The discriminant is $D_{K} = 53$. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n$$\nM_{K} = \\left(\\frac{2!}{2^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{0}\\sqrt{|53|} = \\frac{2}{4}\\sqrt{53} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{53}\n$$\nTo assess this bound, we can approximate its value. Since $7^2=49$ and $8^2=64$, we know $7  \\sqrt{53}  8$. Thus, the Minkowski bound is in the range $3.5  M_{K}  4$. A more precise value is $M_{K} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(7.28) = 3.64$.\nMinkowski's theorem asserts that every ideal class in the class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\leq M_{K}$. The class group is generated by the classes of prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ for which $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\leq M_{K}$. We must therefore investigate the prime ideals whose norms are less than or equal to the integer part of the bound, $\\lfloor M_{K} \\rfloor = 3$. The rational primes to consider are $p=2$ and $p=3$.\n\nWe now analyze the splitting behavior of the rational primes $p=2$ and $p=3$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The splitting of a prime $p$ in the ring of integers of a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is determined by the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{D_K}{p}\\right)$ for odd primes $p$, and by the residue of $D_K$ modulo $8$ for $p=2$.\nFor $p=2$, the discriminant is $D_K = 53$. We check its residue modulo $8$: $53 = 6 \\times 8 + 5$, so $53 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. For a quadratic field with discriminant $D_K$, the prime $2$ is inert if $D_K \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. Thus, $2$ is inert in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. This means the ideal $2\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. We denote it by $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2)$. The norm of this prime ideal is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = N(2\\mathcal{O}_{K}) = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nFor $p=3$, we compute the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{D_K}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{53}{3}\\right)$.

Its norm is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3) = N(3\\mathcal{O}_{K}) = 3^2 = 9$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Dedekind's criterion on the minimal polynomial of $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{53}}{2}$, which is $f(x) = x^2 - x - \\left(\\frac{53-1}{4}\\right) = x^2 - x - 13$.\n- Modulo $2$: $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x - 1 \\equiv x^2 + x + 1 \\pmod{2}$. This polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (since $f(0) \\equiv 1$ and $f(1) \\equiv 1$), so it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This confirms that $2$ is inert.\n- Modulo $3$: $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - x - 13 \\equiv x^2 - x - 1 \\pmod{3}$. This polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ (since $f(0) \\equiv -1$, $f(1) \\equiv -1$, and $f(2) \\equiv 1$), so it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. This confirms that $3$ is inert.\n\nWe can now deduce the possible norms of prime ideals below the Minkowski bound. We are searching for prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ such that $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\leq M_K \\approx 3.64$. The norm of a prime ideal is always a prime power, $p^k$ for some rational prime $p$ and integer $k \\geq 1$.\n- Is there a prime ideal with norm $2$? A prime ideal of norm $2$ would have to lie over the rational prime $p=2$. This would require $2$ to split or ramify. Since $2$ is inert, the only prime ideal above $2$ is $(2)$ itself, with norm $4$. Thus, there are no prime ideals with norm $2$.\n- Is there a prime ideal with norm $3$? A prime ideal of norm $3$ would have to lie over the rational prime $p=3$. Since $3$ is inert, the only prime ideal above $3$ is $(3)$, with norm $9$.

An element $\\alpha=a+b\\omega \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) has norm:\n$$N(\\alpha) = N(a+b\\omega) = (a+b\\omega)(a+b\\bar{\\omega}) = a^2 + ab(\\omega+\\bar{\\omega}) + b^2\\omega\\bar{\\omega} = a^2+ab+6b^2$$\nThis can also be written as $N(\\alpha) = (a+\\frac{b}{2})^2 + \\frac{23}{4}b^2$. Since the norm is a sum of squares, it is always non-negative.\n\n- **Are prime ideals of norm $2$ principal?**\nWe seek $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $N(\\alpha)=2$. This requires solving $a^2+ab+6b^2=2$ for integers $a, b$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=2$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nIf $b \\ne 0$, then $|b| \\ge 1$. The norm is $N(\\alpha)=(a+\\frac{b}{2})^2+\\frac{23}{4}b^2 \\ge \\frac{23}{4}b^2 \\ge \\frac{23}{4} = 5.75$.\nSince $5.752$, there are no integer solutions for $a, b$ when $b \\ne 0$.\nTherefore, there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $2$. The ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$ are not principal.\n\n- **Are prime ideals of norm $3$ principal?**\nWe seek $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that $N(\\alpha)=3$. This requires solving $a^2+ab+6b^2=3$.\nUsing the same argument as above, if $b \\ne 0$, $N(\\alpha) \\ge 5.75  3$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=3$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\nTherefore, there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $3$. The ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$ are not principal.\n\n**Step 5: Relations in the Class Group**\n\nThe class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the classes $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$.\nFrom $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2 \\mathfrak{p}_2'$, we have $[\\mathfrak{p}_2][\\mathfrak{p}_2'] = [ (2) ] = 1$, where $1$ is the identity class (the class of principal ideals). Thus $[\\mathfrak{p}_2'] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^{-1}$. Since $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field, the class of a conjugate ideal $\\bar{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is the inverse of the class of $\\mathfrak{a}$. Indeed, $\\mathfrak{p}_2' = (2, \\omega-1) = (2, \\bar{\\omega}) = \\bar{\\mathfrak{p}}_2$.\n\nWe must determine the order of the generator $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n- Is $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = 1$? This would imply $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$ is principal. $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2^2)=N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)^2 = 2^2=4$. We check for elements of norm $4$: $a^2+ab+6b^2=4$. Again, if $b \\ne 0$, $N(\\alpha) \\ge 5.75  4$. If $b=0$, $a^2=4 \\implies a=\\pm 2$. The elements $\\pm 2$ generate the ideal $(2)=\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_2'$. Since $\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\ne \\mathfrak{p}_2'$, we have $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 \\ne (2)$. As there are no other principal ideals of norm $4$, $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$ is not principal. So, $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 \\ne 1$.\n\n- Is $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^3 = 1$? This would imply $\\mathfrak{p}_2^3$ is principal. We look for an element of norm $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2^3)=8$. We solve $a^2+ab+6b^2=8$.\nIf $b=\\pm 1$, the equation becomes $a^2 \\pm a + 6 = 8 \\implies a^2\\pm a - 2 = 0$.\nFor $b=1$, $a^2+a-2=0 \\implies (a+2)(a-1)=0$, so $a=1$ or $a=-2$.\nThis gives two elements with norm $8$: $\\alpha_1 = 1+\\omega$ and $\\alpha_2 = -2+\\omega$.\nLet's analyze the principal ideal $(\\alpha_1)=(1+\\omega)$. $N(1+\\omega)=8=2^3$. So $(1+\\omega)$ must be a product of three prime ideals above $2$.\nTo find its factorization, we check if $1+\\omega$ is in $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ or $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$.\nIn the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$, $\\omega$ maps to the root $0$. Thus $1+\\omega \\mapsto 1+0=1 \\not\\equiv 0$. So $1+\\omega \\notin \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\nIn the quotient ring $\\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_2' \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$, $\\omega$ maps to the root $1$. Thus $1+\\omega \\mapsto 1+1=2 \\equiv 0$. So $1+\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2'$.\nSince $(1+\\omega)$ is divisible by $\\mathfrak{p}_2'$ but not by $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, its factorization must be $(1+\\omega) = (\\mathfrak{p}_2')^3$.\nThis implies that $(\\mathfrak{p}_2')^3$ is a principal ideal, so $[\\mathfrak{p}_2']^3=1$ in the class group. Since $[\\mathfrak{p}_2']\\ne 1$, the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2']$ is exactly $3$. As $[\\mathfrak{p}_2'] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^{-1}$, the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is also $3$.\n\nNow we find the relation between $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$. Consider the element $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$, which has norm $N(\\omega)=6$. The principal ideal $(\\omega)$ has norm $6$, so its prime factorization is $(\\omega)=\\mathfrak{q}_2\\mathfrak{q}_3$, where $\\mathfrak{q}_2$ is a prime ideal above $2$ and $\\mathfrak{q}_3$ is a prime ideal above $3$.\n- Divisibility by a prime ideal above $2$: $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(2,\\omega)$. Clearly $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_2$. So $\\mathfrak{q}_2 = \\mathfrak{p}_2$.\n- Divisibility by a prime ideal above $3$: $\\mathfrak{p}_3=(3,\\omega)$. Clearly $\\omega \\in \\mathfrak{p}_3$. So $\\mathfrak{q}_3 = \\mathfrak{p}_3$.\nThus, we have the ideal equality $(\\omega) = \\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3$.\nThis gives a relation in the class group:\n$$[(\\omega)] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2][\\mathfrak{p}_3] = 1$$\nThis implies that $[\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^{-1}$. Using the fact that $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ has order $3$, we can write this as $[\\mathfrak{p}_3] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2$.\n\n**Conclusion: The Class Number**\n\nThe class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the classes $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$. We have found that $[\\mathfrak{p}_3]$ is a power of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. Therefore, the class group is generated solely by $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ (or any other non-trivial class). It is a cyclic group.\nWe have established that the order of the generator $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is $3$.\nThus, the class group is $Cl(K) = \\{[\\mathcal{O}_K], [\\mathfrak{p}_2], [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2\\}$, which is a cyclic group of order $3$.\nThe class number $h_K$ is the order of the class group.\n$$h_K = |Cl(K)| = 3$$\nThe analysis confirms that the class group is cyclic, generated by an element of order $3$. The exact value of the class number is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "3010119"}]}
