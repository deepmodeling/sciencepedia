This is the ring of integers of the quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. As the ring of integers of a number field, $R$ is a Dedekind domain, which means every non-zero proper ideal has a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals.\n\nThe factorization of a rational prime ideal $(p)$ in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is determined by the behavior of the minimal polynomial of the generator of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ modulo $p$. For $R = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, the element $\\omega$ satisfies the minimal polynomial $x^2 - x + 1 = 0$. The ring can be described as $R \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2 - x + 1)$.\n\nTo understand the factorization of the ideal $(2)$, we consider the quotient ring $R/(2)$:\n$$R/(2) \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2-x+1)}{(2)} \\cong \\frac{(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})[x]}{(x^2-x+1)}$$\nIn the field with two elements, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, addition and subtraction are the same, so the polynomial $x^2-x+1$ becomes $x^2+x+1$.\n\nThe structure of the ideal $(2)$ in $R$ depends on the factorization of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+x+1$ over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nWe test for roots of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n-   $f(0) = 0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0$\n-   $f(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 \\neq 0$\nSince $f(x)$ is a degree-$2$ polynomial with no roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nAccording to a fundamental theorem in algebraic number theory (Dedekind-Kummer theorem), because the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the ideal $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $R$. Such a prime is called inert.\n\nSince $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $R$, its factorization into prime ideals is simply $(2)$ itself.\n\nThe problem asks whether the element $2 \\in R$ is a prime element. An element $p$ in a commutative ring with unity is prime if the principal ideal $(p)$ is a non-zero prime ideal. Since we have established that $(2)$ is a prime ideal in $R$, the element $2$ is, by definition, a prime element in $R$. (Note: In $R$, which is a principal ideal domain (PID), the concepts of prime and irreducible elements coincide. One could also show $2$ is irreducible by demonstrating it has no non-trivial factors, which can be done using norms. The norm of an element $a+b\\omega$ is $N(a+b\\omega) = a^2+ab+b^2$. If $2=\\alpha\\beta$ for non-units $\\alpha, \\beta \\in R$, then $N(2)=N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$, so $4=N(\\alpha)N(\\beta)$. Since $\\alpha, \\beta$ are not units, $N(\\alpha)>1$ and $N(\\beta)>1$, forcing $N(\\alpha)=N(\\beta)=2$. However, the equation $a^2+ab+b^2=2$ has no integer solutions for $a$ and $b$, so no element of norm $2$ exists. Thus, $2$ is irreducible and hence prime.)\n\nFinally, we must determine the ramification index $e$. The problem gives the general form for the decomposition of $(2)$ as $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}^e$, where $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal and $e$ is the ramification index. This form implies that the ideal $(2)$ is a power of a single prime ideal, which is true for both inert and totally ramified primes.\n\nFor our case, where $(2)$ is an inert prime ideal, the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ in the factorization is the ideal $(2)$ itself. The factorization is thus:\n$$(2) = (2)^1$$\nBy comparing this to the given form $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}^e$, we identify:\n-   The prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = (2)$.\n-   The ramification index $e = 1$.\n\nThe general relation for factorization is $\\sum_{i=1}^{g} e_i f_i = n$, where $g$ is the number of distinct prime ideal factors, $e_i$ are the ramification indices, $f_i$ are the inertia degrees, and $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the degree of the field extension.\nFor an inert prime, $g=1$. We have found $e=1$. The degree of the extension $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n=2$. Thus, $e \\cdot f = 1 \\cdot f = 2$, which implies the inertia degree is $f=2$. This is consistent, as the quotient ring $R/(2)$ is a field extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ of degree $2$.\n\nThe specific value requested by the problem is the ramification index $e$.

The set $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ forms a $\\mathbb{Q}$-basis for $K$.\n\n**Part 1: Determining the Ring of Integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ and an Integral Basis**\n\nThe ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ consists of all elements in $K$ that are roots of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. We always have the inclusion $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$. To determine if this inclusion is an equality, we use the discriminant.\n\nThe discriminant of the basis $\\{1, \\theta, \\theta^2\\}$ is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$. For a general cubic $x^3+px+q$, the discriminant is $-4p^3-27q^2$. Here, $p=0$ and $q=-2$.\n$$\nd(1, \\theta, \\theta^2) = \\text{disc}(f) = -4(0)^3 - 27(-2)^2 = -108\n$$\nThe relationship between this discriminant, the field discriminant $d_K$, and the index of the order $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ in the maximal order $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is given by:\n$$\nd(1, \\theta, \\theta^2) = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 d_K\n$$\nSubstituting the value we found:\n$$\n-108 = [\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]^2 d_K\n$$\nThis implies that the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$ must be an integer whose square divides $108 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3$. The only possible prime factors of the index are thus $2$ and $3$.\n\nWe can use a theorem which states that if the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ of $\\theta$ is Eisenstein with respect to a prime $p$, then $p$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$.\nThe polynomial $f(x)=x^3-2$ is Eisenstein for $p=2$ since $2$ divides the coefficient of $x^1$ (which is $0$) and the constant term $-2$, but $2^2=4$ does not divide $-2$, and $2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $1$. Therefore, $2$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$.\n\nTo check for the prime $p=3$, we use Dedekind's criterion. We consider the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo $3$:\n$$\n\\bar{f}(x) = x^3 - 2 \\equiv x^3 + 1 \\pmod{3}\n$$\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$, we have $x^3+1 = (x+1)(x^2-x+1) = (x+1)(x^2+2x+1) = (x+1)(x+1)^2 = (x+1)^3$.\nSo, we have one repeated factor $\\bar{g}(x) = x+1$ with multiplicity $e=3$. We lift $\\bar{g}(x)$ back to a monic polynomial $g(x) = x+1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Now we compute the polynomial $h(x)$ from the criterion:\n$$\nh(x) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( f(x) - g(x)^e \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( (x^3-2) - (x+1)^3 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nh(x) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( x^3 - 2 - (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} (-3x^2 - 3x - 3) = -x^2 - x - 1\n$$\nNow we reduce $h(x)$ modulo $3$ to get $\\bar{h}(x) = -x^2 - x - 1 \\equiv 2x^2+2x+2 \\pmod{3}$.\nDedekind's criterion states that $3$ divides the index if and only if $\\bar{g}(x)$ divides $\\bar{h}(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$. We test this by checking if the root of $\\bar{g}(x)=x+1$, which is $x=-1$, is also a root of $\\bar{h}(x)$:\n$$\n\\bar{h}(-1) = -(-1)^2 - (-1) - 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n$$\nSince $\\bar{g}(x)$ does not divide $\\bar{h}(x)$, the prime $3$ does not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]]$.\n\nSince neither $2$ nor $3$ divides the index, the index must be $1$.

The norm of a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$ is the absolute value of the field norm of its generator, $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$.\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}((3\\theta^2)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(3\\theta^2)|\n$$\nThe field norm is multiplicative: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(3\\theta^2) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(3) \\cdot N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\theta^2)$.\nFor an element $c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, its norm in a degree $n$ extension is $c^n$. Here $n=3$, so $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(3) = 3^3 = 27$.\nThe norm of $\\theta$ is given by $(-1)^n$ times the constant term of its minimal polynomial $f(x)=x^3-2$:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\theta) = (-1)^3(-2) = 2$.\nUsing the multiplicative property of the norm again:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\theta^2) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\theta))^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\nCombining these results:\n$$\nN_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(3\\theta^2) = 27 \\cdot 4 = 108\n$$\nSo, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}) = |108| = 108$.\n\nNow for the right-hand side. We found the discriminant to be $d_K = -108$.\nIts absolute value is $|d_K| = |-108| = 108$.\nThe relation is verified, as both sides equal $108$.\n\n**Part 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for a principal generator of the different ideal $\\mathfrak{D}_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}$ expressed in terms of $\\theta$.
