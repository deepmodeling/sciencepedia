The ideal class of $\\mathfrak{a}$ is $[\\mathfrak{a}] = [(\\alpha)\\mathfrak{j}^{-1}] = [(\\alpha)][\\mathfrak{j}]^{-1}$. Since $(\\alpha)$ is principal, its class is the identity. The class of $\\mathfrak{j}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{-1}$, so the class of $\\mathfrak{j}^{-1}$ is $\\mathcal{C}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal in the class $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nTaking norms, we have $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}((\\alpha)) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{j})$. The norm of a principal ideal $(\\alpha)$ is $|N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)|$.

Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be any ideal class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. From the result just derived, we know there must exist an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K$. By the hypothesis, this ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ must be principal. If $\\mathfrak{a}$ is principal, its ideal class $[\\mathfrak{a}]$ is the identity element of $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$. Since $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathcal{C}$, we have $[\\mathfrak{a}]=\\mathcal{C}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{C}$ is the identity class. As $\\mathcal{C}$ was an arbitrary class, this implies all classes are the identity class, and so $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ is the trivial group, which means the class number $h_K = 1$.\n\nFinally, we apply this framework to $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis is a quadratic field, so its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n=2$. The minimal polynomial is $x^2-2=0$, whose roots are $\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$. Both are real, so there are $r_1=2$ real embeddings and $r_2=0$ pairs of complex embeddings. The signature is $(2,0)$.\nThe ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$, which has an integral basis $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$.\nThe discriminant $d_K$ is the square of the determinant of the matrix whose entries are the embeddings of the basis elements:\n$$ d_K = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1(1) & \\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ \\sigma_2(1) & \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}) \\end{pmatrix}^2 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 & -\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}^2 = (-\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{2})^2 = (-2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8 $$\nSo, $|d_K|=8$.\nNow, we compute the Minkowski bound $M_K$ for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$$ M_K = \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\sqrt{|d_K|} = \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{0} \\sqrt{8} = \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} $$\nThe value of the bound is $M_K = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\nWe need to check all integral ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le \\sqrt{2}$. The norm of a nonzero integral ideal is a positive integer. The only positive integer less than or equal to $\\sqrt{2}$ is $1$.\nSo we must consider ideals $\\mathfrak{a}$ with $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) = 1$. The norm of an ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K:\\mathfrak{a}]$. If this index is $1$, then $\\mathfrak{a}$ must be equal to $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nThe ideal $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the principal ideal $(1)$.\nThus, the only integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K$, which is principal.\nBased on the conclusion we established, since every integral ideal with norm at most $M_K$ is principal, the class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ must be trivial.\nTherefore, the class number is $h_K = |\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_K)| = 1$.\nThe class number of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3027207"}, {"introduction": "While some number fields have a trivial class group, many do not, indicating a failure of unique factorization.

The field is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d = -5$. Since $d \\equiv -5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is given by $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.

The norm of such an element is $N(a + b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the discriminant of the field $K$. For a field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ square-free and $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is $d_K = 4d$. In our case, $d = -5$, so the discriminant is $d_K = 4(-5) = -20$.\n\nMinkowski's theorem states that every ideal class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ whose norm $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ satisfies the inequality:\n$$N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K = \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\sqrt{|d_K|}$$\nFor the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, the degree of the extension is $n = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. As an imaginary quadratic field, it has $r_1 = 0$ real embeddings and $r_2 = 1$ pair of complex conjugate embeddings. We have $|d_K| = |-20| = 20$.\nSubstituting these values into the Minkowski bound formula gives:\n$$M_K = \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{1} \\sqrt{20} = \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{5} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{\\pi}$$\nTo determine the integer upper limit for the norm, we can approximate this value.

Therefore, we only need to examine the prime ideals lying above the rational primes $p$ such that $N(\\mathfrak{p}) \\le M_K$. Since the norm of a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ lying above a rational prime $p$ is of the form $p^f$ for some integer $f \\ge 1$, we only need to consider rational primes $p \\le 2$.\n\nThe ideals to consider are those with norm $1$ or $2$.\nAn ideal of norm $1$ is unique: it is the ring $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ itself, which is the principal ideal $(1)$. This ideal represents the identity element in the ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$.\n\nNext, we consider ideals of norm $2$. To find these, we must examine the factorization of the ideal $(2)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. We use Dedekind's theorem on the factorization of primes. The minimal polynomial of the generator $\\sqrt{-5}$ is $f(x) = x^2 + 5$. We consider this polynomial modulo the prime $p=2$:\n$$x^2 + 5 \\equiv x^2 + 1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2}$$\nSince the polynomial has a repeated root $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, the prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The ideal $(2)$ factors as the square of a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, i.e., $(2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2$. The ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is given by $(2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$.\nThe norm of this ideal is $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = \\sqrt{N((2))} = \\sqrt{N(2)} = \\sqrt{2^2} = 2$. Thus, there is exactly one ideal of norm $2$, namely $\\mathfrak{p}_2$.\n\nThe ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ is generated by the classes of the prime ideals with norm less than or equal to the Minkowski bound $M_K$. In our case, the only such prime ideal that could potentially be non-principal is $\\mathfrak{p}_2$. Therefore, the class group is generated by the class of $\\mathfrak{p}_2$, denoted $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n\nTo determine the structure of the class group, we must find the order of the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. The order is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^k$ is a principal ideal.\nFrom the ramification, we know that $\\mathfrak{p}_2^2 = (2)$. The ideal $(2)$ is generated by the element $2 \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$, so it is a principal ideal. This implies that in the class group, $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [(2)] = [1]$, where $[1]$ is the identity element. This shows that the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is at most $2$.\n\nThe order is exactly $2$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not itself a principal ideal. Let us test if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is principal. If $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), then the norm of the ideal would be equal to the norm of the element:\n$$N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = N(\\alpha) = N(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$$\nWe know $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$, so we need to solve the Diophantine equation:\n$$a^2 + 5b^2 = 2$$\nfor integers $a$ and $b$.\nIf $b \\ne 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\ge 5$. In this case, $a^2 + 5b^2 \\ge 5 > 2$.\nIf $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2 = 2$. There is no integer $a$ that satisfies this equation.\nThus, there are no integer solutions $(a,b)$ to the equation $a^2 + 5b^2 = 2$. This proves that there is no element in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with norm $2$. Consequently, the ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not a principal ideal.\n\nSo, the class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity element in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$. Since $[\\mathfrak{p}_2] \\ne [1]$ and $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = [1]$, the order of the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is exactly $2$.\nThe ideal class group is generated by a single element of order $2$.
