A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the application of Minkowski's convex body theorem. Let us state the theorem for clarity. In $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, let $\\Lambda$ be a full-rank lattice and let $C$ be a centrally symmetric, convex, measurable set. If $\\operatorname{vol}(C)  2^{n} \\det(\\Lambda)$, then $C$ contains at least one nonzero point of $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe problem is set in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so the dimension is $n=2$. The lattice is $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. The set is $C_t = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : |x| + |y| \\le t\\}$.\n\nFirst, we must compute the determinant of the lattice, $\\det(\\Lambda)$. The standard integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is generated by the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which are $\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. A basis matrix $B$ for $\\Lambda$ can be formed by taking these vectors as columns:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = I_2\n$$\nThe determinant of the lattice is the absolute value of the determinant of this matrix:\n$$\n\\det(\\Lambda) = |\\det(B)| = |\\det(I_2)| = |1| = 1\n$$\nSo, the determinant of the lattice $\\Lambda=\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is $1$.\n\nNext, we must compute the volume (which is the area in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$) of the set $C_t$. The set $C_t$ is a square in the plane, rotated by $45$ degrees, with vertices at $(t, 0)$, $(0, t)$, $(-t, 0)$, and $(0, -t)$. We can compute its area, $\\operatorname{vol}(C_t)$, using a double integral.\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = \\iint_{|x|+|y|\\le t} 1 \\, dx \\, dy\n$$\nDue to the symmetry of the domain with respect to both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis, we can compute the area in the first quadrant ($x \\ge 0$, $y \\ge 0$) and multiply the result by $4$. In the first quadrant, the inequality $|x|+|y|\\le t$ simplifies to $x+y \\le t$, or $y \\le t-x$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = 4 \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{0}^{t-x} 1 \\, dy \\, dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the inner integral with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t-x} 1 \\, dy = [y]_{0}^{t-x} = t-x\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the outer integral with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = 4 \\int_{0}^{t} (t-x) \\, dx = 4 \\left[ tx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t) = 4 \\left( \\left(t \\cdot t - \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(t \\cdot 0 - \\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) \\right) = 4 \\left( t^2 - \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right) = 4 \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right) = 2t^2\n$$\nSo, the volume of the set $C_t$ is $2t^2$.\n\nNow we apply Minkowski's theorem. The theorem guarantees a nonzero point of $\\Lambda$ in $C_t$ if the following condition is met:\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_t)  2^{n} \\det(\\Lambda)\n$$\nSubstituting our values ($n=2$, $\\det(\\Lambda)=1$, $\\operatorname{vol}(C_t)=2t^2$):\n$$\n2t^2  2^2 \\cdot 1\n$$\n$$\n2t^2  4\n$$\n$$\nt^2  2\n$$\nSince the problem specifies $t  0$, this inequality is equivalent to $t  \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"exact threshold value of $t$ at which the theorem’s volume condition is met\". This is the boundary value where the strict inequality transitions, which corresponds to the equality case. This threshold value, let's call it $t_0$, is the value that makes the volume exactly equal to the critical value $2^n \\det(\\Lambda)$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{vol}(C_{t_0}) = 2^2 \\det(\\Lambda)\n$$\n$$\n2t_0^2 = 4\n$$\n$$\nt_0^2 = 2\n$$\nGiven $t_0  0$, the unique solution is $t_0 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor any $t  \\sqrt{2}$, the volume condition $\\operatorname{vol}(C_t)  4$ is satisfied, and Minkowski's theorem guarantees that $C_t$ contains a nonzero point of the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.

Derivation of the explicit inequality description of the transformed convex body $AK$.\nLet $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3) \\in AK$. By definition of a transformed set, this means there exists a vector $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in K$ such that $y = Ax$. From this relationship, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = A^{-1}y$.

Computation of the exact volume $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)$.\nWe compute this volume using two different methods to ensure correctness.\n\nMethod A: Using the volume scaling property.\nThe problem states that the Lebesgue volume scales by $|\\det(A)|$ under a linear map $A$, so $\\operatorname{vol}(AK) = |\\det(A)| \\operatorname{vol}(K)$. First, we compute the volume of the original ellipsoid $K$. The semi-axes of $K$ are given by the denominators in its defining inequality: $r_1 = 1/3$, $r_2 = 2$, and $r_3 = 1/2$. The volume of a $3D$ ellipsoid with semi-axes $r_1, r_2, r_3$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_1 r_2 r_3$.\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(K) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(2)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{9}\\pi $$\nThe determinant of the map $A = \\operatorname{diag}(3,1,2)$ is $\\det(A) = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 6$. So, $|\\det(A)| = 6$.\nTherefore, the volume of the transformed body is:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(AK) = |\\det(A)| \\operatorname{vol}(K) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9}\\pi = \\frac{24}{9}\\pi = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi $$\n\nMethod B: Direct computation from the description of $AK$.\nThe inequality for $AK$ is $y_1^2 + (\\frac{y_2}{2})^2 + y_3^2 \\leq 1$. This can be written as:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{y_1}{1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_2}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_3}{1}\\right)^2 \\leq 1 $$\nThis is an ellipsoid with semi-axes $r'_1 = 1$, $r'_2 = 2$, and $r'_3 = 1$. Its volume is:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(AK) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r'_1 r'_2 r'_3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (1)(2)(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi $$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.\n\n3. Computation of $\\det(A\\Lambda)$ and verification of the Minkowski volume inequality.\nThe lattice is given as $\\Lambda = A^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}^3$. We are asked to compute the determinant of the transformed lattice $A\\Lambda$. Applying the transformation $A$ to $\\Lambda$:\n$$ A\\Lambda = A(A^{-1}\\mathbb{Z}^3) = (AA^{-1})\\mathbb{Z}^3 = I\\mathbb{Z}^3 = \\mathbb{Z}^3 $$\nThe transformed lattice is the standard integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. The determinant of a lattice $\\Gamma = B\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is $|\\det(B)|$. For $\\mathbb{Z}^3$, the matrix $B$ is the identity matrix $I$, so its determinant is $|\\det(I)| = 1$. Thus, $\\det(A\\Lambda) = \\det(\\mathbb{Z}^3) = 1$.\nNow we must verify the inequality $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)  2^3 \\det(A\\Lambda)$. We have $\\operatorname{vol}(AK) = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi$ and $2^3 \\det(A\\Lambda) = 8 \\cdot 1 = 8$. The inequality becomes $\\frac{8}{3}\\pi  8$, which simplifies to $\\pi  3$. This is a known mathematical fact. Thus, the inequality is verified.\n\n4. Conclusion based on Minkowski's theorem and exhibition of a nonzero integer point.\nMinkowski's convex body theorem states that for a lattice $\\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and an origin-symmetric convex set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, if $\\operatorname{vol}(S)  2^n \\det(\\Gamma)$, then $S$ contains at least one non-zero point of $\\Gamma$.\nThe problem of finding a non-zero point $x \\in \\Lambda \\cap K$ is equivalent to finding a non-zero integer point $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$ in the transformed set $AK$, where $y = Ax$. We apply Minkowski's theorem to the lattice $\\Gamma = A\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^3$ and the set $S = AK$ with $n=3$.\n- $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ is a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- $AK$ is a convex set because $K$ is convex and $A$ is a linear map.\n- $AK$ is origin-symmetric because $K$ is origin-symmetric ($x \\in K \\implies -x \\in K$), which implies $y=Ax \\in AK \\implies -y = A(-x) \\in AK$.\n- We have shown in part 3 that $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)  2^3 \\det(\\mathbb{Z}^3)$.\nAll conditions of the theorem are satisfied. Therefore, there exists a non-zero point $y \\in AK \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^3$.\nTo exhibit one such point, we must find a non-zero integer vector $y = (y_1, y_2, y_3)$ that satisfies the inequality for $AK$:\n$$ y_1^2 + \\left(\\frac{y_2}{2}\\right)^2 + y_3^2 \\leq 1 $$\nConsider the point $y = (0, 1, 0)$. It is a non-zero integer vector. Substituting its components into the inequality gives:\n$$ 0^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nSince $\\frac{1}{4} \\leq 1$, the point $y = (0, 1, 0)$ is in $AK$. Another simple example is $y=(1,0,0)$, which gives $1^2+0^2+0^2=1 \\leq 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact value of $\\operatorname{vol}(AK)$ as the final answer.

We verify that $n = r_{1} + 2r_{2} = 1 + 2(1) = 3$, which is correct.\n\nNext, we compute the absolute value of the discriminant of the field, $|D_{K}|$. For a number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is a root of an irreducible monic polynomial $g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the field discriminant $D_{K}$ is related to the polynomial discriminant $\\operatorname{disc}(g)$ by the formula $\\operatorname{disc}(g) = [\\mathcal{O}_{K}:\\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha]]^{2} D_{K}$.\n\nFor the pure cubic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{m})$ with $m$ being a cubefree integer, a standard result states that if $m \\not\\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{9}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{m}]$.

By Minkowski's convex body theorem, $B_{t}$ must contain a nonzero point of the lattice $\\Lambda$. This corresponds to a nonzero algebraic integer $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ such that its image under the Minkowski embedding, $\\Psi(\\alpha)$, lies in $B_{t}$. This implies that for every embedding $\\sigma$ of $K$ (real or complex), the inequality $|\\sigma(\\alpha)| \\leq t$ holds, which is the conclusion described in the problem statement. The problem asks specifically for the value of $t^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}}\n$$", "id": "3017837"}]}
