Your derivation of the error term should be justified at least at the level of an unconditional bound of the form $O(x^{\\theta(k)})$ with an explicit $\\theta(k)$, and you may also discuss improvements obtainable from classical zero-free regions for the Riemann zeta function.\n\nAs your final output, report only the explicit closed-form expression for the leading constant $C(k)$ such that $S_{k}(x) \\sim C(k)\\,x$ as $x \\to \\infty$.", "solution": "The problem asks for an asymptotic formula for the number of $k$-free integers up to $x$, denoted $S_k(x) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} f_k(n)$. The function $f_k(n)$ is the characteristic function of $k$-free integers, where an integer $n$ is $k$-free if no prime $p$ satisfies $p^k \\mid n$. The integer $k$ is fixed and satisfies $k \\geq 2$.\n\nOur derivation proceeds in several steps. First, we determine the structure of the Dirichlet generating function $F_k(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} f_k(n) n^{-s}$. Next, we analyze its behavior near the point $s=1$. Finally, we apply a Tauberian theorem to deduce the asymptotic behavior of the summatory function $S_k(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: The Dirichlet Generating Function $F_k(s)$**\n\nAn integer $n$ is $k$-free if and only if for every prime $p$, the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$, denoted $v_p(n)$, is less than $k$. That is, $v_p(n) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$ for all primes $p$. This local characterization implies that the function $f_k(n)$ is multiplicative. If $\\gcd(m,n)=1$, then their prime factorizations are disjoint. Thus, $v_p(mn) = v_p(m)$ if $p \\mid m$ and $v_p(mn) = v_p(n)$ if $p \\mid n$. Consequently, $mn$ is $k$-free if and only if both $m$ and $n$ are $k$-free. Therefore, $f_k(mn) = f_k(m) f_k(n)$.\n\nSince $f_k(n)$ is a multiplicative function, its Dirichlet series $F_k(s)$ has an Euler product representation for $\\Re(s)  1$, where the series converges absolutely. The Euler product is given by:\n$$F_k(s) = \\prod_{p} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f_k(p^j)}{p^{js}}$$\nwhere the product is over all prime numbers $p$.\n\nBased on the definition of $f_k(n)$, we have $f_k(p^j)=1$ if $j  k$ and $f_k(p^j)=0$ if $j \\geq k$. The sum in each Euler factor is therefore a finite geometric series:\n$$\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f_k(p^j)}{p^{js}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\left(\\frac{1}{p^s}\\right)^j = 1 + \\frac{1}{p^s} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{p^{(k-1)s}} = \\frac{1 - (p^{-s})^k}{1 - p^{-s}} = \\frac{1 - p^{-ks}}{1 - p^{-s}}$$\nSubstituting this back into the product, we obtain the Euler product for $F_k(s)$:\n$$F_k(s) = \\prod_{p} \\frac{1 - p^{-ks}}{1 - p^{-s}}$$\nThis can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function, $\\zeta(s)$. The Euler product for $\\zeta(s)$ is $\\zeta(s) = \\prod_p (1-p^{-s})^{-1}$ for $\\Re(s)1$.\nWe can write $F_k(s)$ as:\n$$F_k(s) = \\left( \\prod_{p} (1-p^{-s})^{-1} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{p} (1 - p^{-ks}) \\right) = \\zeta(s) \\left( \\prod_{p} (1 - (p^k)^{-s}) \\right)$$\nThe second product is the Euler product for $1/\\zeta(ks)$. Therefore, we arrive at the crucial identity for $\\Re(s)  1$:\n$$F_k(s) = \\frac{\\zeta(s)}{\\zeta(ks)}$$\n\n**Step 2: Analytic Structure of $F_k(s)$ near $s=1$**\n\nWe now examine the analytic properties of $F_k(s)$ in a neighborhood of $s=1$. The Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ is analytic in the entire complex plane, except for a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $1$. Near $s=1$, its Laurent series expansion is $\\zeta(s) = \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\gamma + O(s-1)$, where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nThe denominator in our expression for $F_k(s)$ is $\\zeta(ks)$. Since $k \\geq 2$, when $s$ is near $1$, the argument $ks$ is near $k$. The function $\\zeta(z)$ is analytic and non-zero for all $z$ with $\\Re(z) \\ge 2$. In fact, $|\\zeta(z)-1| \\le \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty n^{-\\Re(z)} \\le \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty n^{-2} = \\zeta(2)-1  1$ for $\\Re(z) \\ge 2$. Thus, $\\zeta(ks)$ is analytic and non-zero at $s=1$. Its value is $\\zeta(k)$.\n\nThe function $F_k(s) = \\frac{\\zeta(s)}{\\zeta(ks)}$ is therefore analytic in any region where both $\\zeta(s)$ and $1/\\zeta(ks)$ are analytic. The only pole of $F_k(s)$ in the half-plane $\\Re(s) \\ge 1$ comes from the pole of $\\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$. We must ensure $\\zeta(ks)$ has no zeros on the line $\\Re(s)=1$, which would create poles for $F_k(s)$. For $s=1+it$, $\\Re(ks)=k \\ge 2$, and $\\zeta(z)$ has no zeros for $\\Re(z)\\ge 1$. Thus, $1/\\zeta(ks)$ is analytic for $\\Re(s)\\ge 1$.\n\nConsequently, $F_k(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=1$. The residue at this pole is:\n$$\\mathrm{Res}_{s=1} F_k(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1) F_k(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1) \\frac{\\zeta(s)}{\\zeta(ks)} = \\left(\\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1)\\zeta(s)\\right) \\left(\\lim_{s \\to 1} \\frac{1}{\\zeta(ks)}\\right)$$\nThe first limit is the residue of $\\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$, which is $1$. The second limit is $\\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}$ by continuity. Thus,\n$$\\mathrm{Res}_{s=1} F_k(s) = \\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}$$\n\n**Step 3: Asymptotic Formula for $S_k(x)$**\n\nThe problem specifies using a Tauberian argument. The Wiener-Ikehara Tauberian theorem is applicable here. It states that if a Dirichlet series $F(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n n^{-s}$ has non-negative coefficients ($a_n \\ge 0$), converges for $\\Re(s)1$, and can be analytically continued to $\\Re(s) \\ge 1$ except for a simple pole at $s=1$ with residue $C$, then the summatory function satisfies $\\sum_{n \\le x} a_n \\sim C x$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nOur function $F_k(s)$ and its coefficients $f_k(n)$ satisfy all these conditions:\n1. The coefficients $f_k(n)$ are either $0$ or $1$, so they are non-negative.\n2. The series $F_k(s)$ converges for $\\Re(s)1$.\n3. We have shown that $F_k(s) = \\zeta(s)/\\zeta(ks)$ is analytic for $\\Re(s) \\ge 1$ except for a simple pole at $s=1$.\n4. The residue at this pole is $C = \\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}$.\n\nApplying the theorem, we conclude that:\n$$S_k(x) = \\sum_{n \\le x} f_k(n) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)} x$$\nThe leading constant is $C(k) = \\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}$.\n\n**Step 4: Error Term Derivation**\n\nTo obtain an error term, we use a more elementary method based on the identity $f_k(n) = \\sum_{d^k \\mid n} \\mu(d)$, where $\\mu$ is the Möbius function.\n$$S_k(x) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} f_k(n) = \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\sum_{d^k \\mid n} \\mu(d)$$\nBy swapping the order of summation, with $n=m d^k$:\n$$S_k(x) = \\sum_{d^k \\le x} \\mu(d) \\sum_{m \\le x/d^k} 1 = \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} \\mu(d) \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{d^k} \\right\\rfloor$$\nUsing $\\lfloor y \\rfloor = y - \\{y\\}$, where $\\{y\\}$ is the fractional part:\n$$S_k(x) = \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} \\mu(d) \\left( \\frac{x}{d^k} - \\left\\{ \\frac{x}{d^k} \\right\\} \\right) = x \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} \\frac{\\mu(d)}{d^k} - \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} \\mu(d) \\left\\{ \\frac{x}{d^k} \\right\\}$$\nThe main term comes from the first sum. We extend it to infinity:\n$$x \\sum_{d=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mu(d)}{d^k} = x \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}$$\nThe error incurred in this extension is:\n$$\\left| -x \\sum_{d  x^{1/k}} \\frac{\\mu(d)}{d^k} \\right| \\le x \\sum_{d  x^{1/k}} \\frac{1}{d^k} \\le x \\int_{x^{1/k}-1}^{\\infty} t^{-k} dt = x \\frac{(x^{1/k}-1)^{1-k}}{k-1} = O(x \\cdot (x^{1/k})^{1-k}) = O(x^{1/k})$$\nThe second sum is also part of the error term:\n$$\\left| \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} \\mu(d) \\left\\{ \\frac{x}{d^k} \\right\\} \\right| \\le \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} |\\mu(d)| \\cdot 1 \\le \\sum_{d \\le x^{1/k}} 1 = \\lfloor x^{1/k} \\rfloor = O(x^{1/k})$$\nCombining these results, we obtain the asymptotic formula with an explicit error term exponent $\\theta(k)=1/k$:\n$$S_k(x) = \\frac{x}{\\zeta(k)} + O(x^{1/k})$$\nThis derivation fulfills the requirement for an unconditional bound. Improvements on this error term, such as the result of Walfisz, $S_k(x) = \\frac{x}{\\zeta(k)} + O\\left(x^{1/k} \\exp\\left(-c_k (\\ln x)^{3/5} (\\ln \\ln x)^{-1/5}\\right)\\right)$, are obtainable by using modern zero-free regions for the Riemann zeta function within a contour integration argument (e.g., via Perron's formula).\n\nThe problem, however, only asks for the final expression for the leading constant $C(k)$. Based on our analysis, this constant is $\\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\zeta(k)}}$$", "id": "3008379"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond main terms, this problem delves into the core mechanism connecting zero-free regions to the error term in the Prime Number Theorem.

The problem is well-posed, asking for the identification of a specific feature of a mathematical proof. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not suffer from any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution by outlining the proof of the Siegel-Walfisz theorem and identifying the source of ineffectivity.\n\nThe proof begins by using the orthogonality of Dirichlet characters to decompose $\\psi(x; q, a)$:\n$$ \\psi(x; q, a) = \\frac{1}{\\phi(q)} \\sum_{\\chi \\bmod q} \\overline{\\chi}(a) \\psi(x, \\chi) $$\nwhere $\\psi(x, \\chi) = \\sum_{n \\le x} \\chi(n) \\Lambda(n)$. This step is entirely constructive and effective.\n\nThe next step is to use the explicit formula, derived from Perron's formula, which relates $\\psi(x, \\chi)$ to the zeros $\\rho = \\beta + i\\gamma$ of the Dirichlet $L$-function $L(s, \\chi)$:\n$$ \\psi(x, \\chi) = \\delta_{\\chi_0} x - \\sum_{|\\gamma| \\le T} \\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} + O\\left(\\frac{x (\\log(qx))^2}{T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\chi_0} = 1$ if $\\chi$ is the principal character $\\chi_0$, and $0$ otherwise. The sum is over the non-trivial zeros $\\rho$ of $L(s, \\chi)$ with $0  \\Re \\rho  1$.\n\nThe main term for $\\psi(x; q, a)$ comes from the principal character, giving $\\frac{x}{\\phi(q)}$. The error term is a sum over the non-principal characters:\n$$ E(x; q, a) \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\phi(q)} \\sum_{\\chi \\ne \\chi_0} \\overline{\\chi}(a) \\sum_{\\rho_\\chi} \\frac{x^{\\rho_\\chi}}{\\rho_\\chi} $$\nThe magnitude of this error is determined by the real parts $\\beta$ of the zeros $\\rho_\\chi$. To get a strong bound, we need a zero-free region of the form $\\Re s = \\sigma  1 - \\delta(q)$ for some positive function $\\delta(q)$.\n\nFor complex characters $\\chi$ (i.e., $\\chi \\ne \\overline{\\chi}$), one can prove the Vinogradov-Korobov zero-free region, $\\sigma \\ge 1 - \\frac{c_1}{\\log(q|t|+2)}$, where $s = \\sigma + it$. The constant $c_1$ is effective. Thus, complex characters do not introduce ineffectivity.\n\nThe problem arises for real, non-principal characters $\\chi$. The standard proof technique used for $\\zeta(s)$ relies on the inequality $3 + 4\\cos\\theta + \\cos(2\\theta) \\ge 0$, which for $L$-functions translates to considering $|L(\\sigma, \\chi_0)^3 L(\\sigma+it, \\chi)^4 L(\\sigma+2it, \\chi^2)| \\ge 1$. If $\\chi$ is a complex character, $\\chi^2$ is a non-principal character. If $\\chi$ is a real, non-principal character, then $\\chi^2 = \\chi_0$ is the principal character. The pole of $L(s, \\chi_0)$ at $s=1$ is used to prevent a zero of $L(s, \\chi)$ from being too close to the line $\\sigma=1$. However, this argument is weakened if $L(1, \\chi)$ is very small, which can happen for real characters. A hypothetical real zero $\\beta$ of $L(s, \\chi)$ very close to $1$ is called a Landau-Siegel zero.\n\nTo rule out such zeros, or at least bound how close they can be to $1$, one invokes **Siegel's theorem**. Siegel's theorem states that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists a constant $C(\\epsilon)  0$ such that for any real primitive non-principal character $\\chi \\pmod q$, we have:\n$$ L(1, \\chi)  C(\\epsilon) q^{-\\epsilon} $$\nThe crucial fact is that the proof of Siegel's theorem is **ineffective**. It demonstrates the existence of $C(\\epsilon)$ without providing a method to compute it. The proof typically involves a contradiction argument comparing two hypothetical characters with Siegel zeros.\n\nThis ineffective lower bound on $L(1, \\chi)$ is then used to establish a zero-free region for $L(s, \\chi)$ for real characters. If $\\beta$ is a real zero of $L(s, \\chi)$, then by the Mean Value Theorem, $L(1, \\chi) = L(1, \\chi) - L(\\beta, \\chi) = (1-\\beta)L'(\\xi, \\chi)$ for some $\\xi \\in (\\beta, 1)$. One can effectively bound $|L'(\\xi, \\chi)| \\le c_2 (\\log q)^2$. Combining this with Siegel's theorem gives:\n$$ C(\\epsilon) q^{-\\epsilon}  L(1, \\chi) \\le c_2 (1-\\beta) (\\log q)^2 $$\n$$ \\implies 1-\\beta  \\frac{C(\\epsilon)}{c_2} q^{-\\epsilon} (\\log q)^{-2} $$\nSince $C(\\epsilon)$ is ineffective, the lower bound on $1-\\beta$ is also ineffective. This result is then extended to create a zero-free region that excludes all zeros (real or complex) of any $L(s, \\chi)$ for $\\chi \\pmod q$ from a certain area to the left of $\\sigma=1$. This is the Deuring-Heilbronn phenomenon. The resulting zero-free region has a width that depends on an ineffective constant.\n\nThe final error term in the Siegel-Walfisz theorem, $O(x \\exp(-c\\sqrt{\\log x}))$, is derived directly from this zero-free region. The constant $c$ in the exponent is proportional to the constant defining the width of the zero-free region. Because that constant is ineffective, $c$ is ineffective. The ineffectivity is therefore introduced precisely at the point where Siegel's theorem on $L(1, \\chi)$ is used to create the zero-free region for real characters.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The constant $c$ is ineffective because the proof invokes Siegel’s lower bound $L(1, \\chi) \\gg_{\\epsilon} q^{-\\epsilon}$ for real primitive characters $\\chi$, whose implied constant depends on $\\epsilon$ in a noncomputable way; the ineffectivity first enters at the step where this lower bound is converted into an exclusion of zeros $s$ with $\\Re s \\ge 1 - c'/\\log q$ for $L(s, \\chi)$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies Siegel's theorem on $L(1, \\chi)$ for real characters as the source of ineffectivity due to its noncomputable implied constant. It also correctly pinpoints the stage where this is applied: to derive a zero-free region (an \"exclusion of zeros\"). The specific form of the region mentioned, $\\Re s \\ge 1 - c'/\\log q$, is a known consequence (in the absence of an exceptional zero), and the constant $c'$ is the one that becomes ineffective. This option provides a complete and accurate account.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The constant $c$ is ineffective because the proof uses the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and the ineffectivity appears when employing zero-density estimates that assume GRH to control zeros of $L(s, \\chi)$.**\nThe Siegel-Walfisz theorem is an unconditional result; its proof does not assume GRH. Assuming GRH would yield a much stronger theorem with effective constants. This statement is fundamentally incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The constant $c$ is ineffective because the explicit formula relating $\\psi(x; q, a)$ to zeros of $L(s, \\chi)$ via Perron’s method introduces truncation errors with unknown constants; the ineffectivity first appears when choosing the height of the contour in the complex plane.**\nThe constants arising from the truncation of the contour integral in Perron's method are all effective. They can be explicitly calculated or bounded. This part of the proof is not the source of ineffectivity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The constant $c$ is ineffective because the orthogonality of characters is nonconstructive; the ineffectivity first appears when decomposing $\\psi(x; q, a)$ as an average over characters $\\chi \\bmod q$.**\nThe decomposition using orthogonality relations is a finite sum involving computable quantities. This step is fully constructive and effective. This statement is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The constant $c$ is ineffective because the Vinogradov–Korobov zero-free region for $L(s, \\chi)$ has nonexplicit constants; the ineffectivity first appears when applying the zero-free region to complex characters $\\chi$.**\nThe constants in the Vinogradov-Korobov zero-free region are effective. Furthermore, the source of ineffectivity lies with *real* characters, not complex ones, as their specific properties lead to the potential for Siegel zeros.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that correctly explains the origin of the ineffectivity in the Siegel-Walfisz theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3021422"}]}
