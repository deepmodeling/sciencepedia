According to the definition provided, $r(2)$ is the number of distinct solutions to the congruence\n$$\na(a+2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is a residue class modulo $2$. The integers modulo $2$ consist of two residue classes, represented by $a=0$ and $a=1$. We test each case:\n\nCase 1: $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\nSubstituting $a=0$ into the congruence, we get:\n$$\n0 \\cdot (0+2) \\equiv 0 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\n$$\nThis congruence is true.

Therefore, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ is not a solution.\n\nFrom these two cases, we find that there is only one residue class modulo $2$ that satisfies the condition, namely $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. Thus, the number of such residue classes is $r(2) = 1$.\n\nThis result illuminates why $p=2$ is considered an exceptional prime for the twin prime problem. For any other prime $p2$, the congruence $a(a+2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ has two distinct solutions: $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ and $a \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ (since $p2$, $0 \\not\\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$). Thus, for $p2$, we have $r(p)=2$. For $p=2$, the two potential roots $0$ and $-2$ become congruent modulo $2$, so they merge into a single root, yielding $r(2)=1$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $p=2$ and $r(2)=1$ into the formula for $f_{p}$:\n$$\nf_{2} = \\frac{1-\\frac{r(2)}{2}}{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{1-\\frac{1}{2}}{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nThe expression can be simplified.

So, $\\frac{Ax}{(z^{\\ast})^2(\\ln z^{\\ast})^3} = B$. Substituting this into the second derivative expression evaluated at $z=z^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d^2 f}{dz^2} \\right|_{z=z^{\\ast}} = 2 B + 2 B \\left( 1 + \\frac{3}{\\ln z^{\\ast}} \\right) = 4 B + \\frac{6 B}{\\ln z^{\\ast}}$$\nSince $B  0$ and $z^{\\ast}$ is large (so $\\ln z^{\\ast}  0$), the second derivative is positive. Thus, the critical point $z^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a local minimum, which is also the global minimum for $z$ in the specified range due to the function's shape.\nThe asymptotically optimal choice $z = z^{\\ast}(x)$ is therefore given by the derived expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{8A}{B}} \\frac{x^{1/2}}{(\\ln x)^{3/2}}}$$", "id": "3009399"}]}
