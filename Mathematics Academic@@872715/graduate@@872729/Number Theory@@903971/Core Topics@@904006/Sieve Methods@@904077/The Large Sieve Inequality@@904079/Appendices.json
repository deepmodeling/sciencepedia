The problem states that this largest eigenvalue, denoted $L(N,M)$, is the optimal constant in the large sieve inequality for the given set of points.\n\nThe entries of the Gram matrix $G$ are given by\n$$\nG_{j,k} = \\sum_{n=-M}^{M} \\exp\\big(2\\pi i\\, n\\, (\\alpha_{j} - \\alpha_{k})\\big) \\quad \\text{for } j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}.\n$$\nThe points are specified as $\\alpha_{j} = j/N$. Substituting this into the expression for $G_{j,k}$ yields\n$$\nG_{j,k} = \\sum_{n=-M}^{M} \\exp\\left(2\\pi i\\, n\\, \\frac{j-k}{N}\\right).\n$$\nThe matrix $G$ is Hermitian by construction ($G = TT^*$). Its eigenvalues are real and non-negative. The largest eigenvalue of $G = TT^*$ is equal to the operator norm of $G$, which is also equal to $\\|T\\|^2$. A fundamental result in linear algebra states that the non-zero eigenvalues of $TT^*$ are identical to the non-zero eigenvalues of $T^*T$. The matrix $T^*T$ is a $(2M+1) \\times (2M+1)$ matrix, whereas $G$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix. Since the problem specifies $2M+1 \\leq N$, the matrix $T^*T$ is of smaller dimension than $G$, making its analysis more straightforward. We proceed by computing the entries of $T^*T$.\n\nThe operator $T$ maps a coefficient vector $a=(a_n)_{n=-M}^M$ to a vector of samples $(Ta)_j$. Its matrix representation can be written as $(T)_{j,n'} = \\exp(2\\pi i n' \\alpha_j)$ where $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$ and the column index $n'$ runs over $\\{-M, \\dots, M\\}$. The adjoint operator $T^*$ has matrix entries $(T^*)_{n',j} = \\overline{(T)_{j,n'}} = \\exp(-2\\pi i n' \\alpha_j)$.\n\nThe entries of the matrix $T^*T$, indexed by $n,k \\in \\{-M, \\dots, M\\}$, are given by\n$$\n(T^*T)_{n,k} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (T^*)_{n,j} (T)_{j,k} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp(-2\\pi i n \\alpha_j) \\exp(2\\pi i k \\alpha_j).\n$$\nCombining the exponents and substituting $\\alpha_j = j/N$, we get\n$$\n(T^*T)_{n,k} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp(2\\pi i (k-n) \\alpha_j) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i (k-n) j}{N}\\right).\n$$\nThis is a standard sum of the $N$-th roots of unity, which is a consequence of the orthogonality of characters of the finite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$. The sum evaluates as:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i \\ell j}{N}\\right) = \\begin{cases} N  \\text{if } \\ell \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } \\ell \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{N} \\end{cases}\n$$\nIn our case, the integer $\\ell$ is $k-n$. The indices $n$ and $k$ both belong to the set $\\{-M, -M+1, \\dots, M\\}$. The difference $k-n$ therefore lies in the range\n$$\n(-M) - M \\leq k-n \\leq M - (-M),\n$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\n-2M \\leq k-n \\leq 2M.\n$$\nThe problem provides the crucial spacing condition $2M+1 \\leq N$, which implies $2M  N$.\nTherefore, the only integer multiple of $N$ in the interval $[-2M, 2M]$ is $0$. The condition $k-n \\equiv 0 \\pmod N$ can only be satisfied if $k-n = 0$, which means $k=n$.\n\nApplying this result to the entries of $T^*T$:\n- If $n \\neq k$, then $k-n \\neq 0$ and $k-n$ is not a multiple of $N$. Thus, $(T^*T)_{n,k} = 0$.\n- If $n = k$, then $k-n = 0$. Thus, $(T^*T)_{n,n} = N$.\n\nThis demonstrates that $T^*T$ is a diagonal matrix. Specifically, it is $N$ times the identity matrix of size $(2M+1) \\times (2M+1)$:\n$$\nT^*T = N \\cdot I_{2M+1}.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries. Therefore, the matrix $T^*T$ has $2M+1$ eigenvalues, all of which are equal to $N$.\n\nSince the non-zero eigenvalues of $G = TT^*$ are the same as the non-zero eigenvalues of $T^*T$, the matrix $G$ has $2M+1$ eigenvalues equal to $N$, and the remaining $N-(2M+1)$ eigenvalues must be $0$.\n\nThe largest eigenvalue of $G$ is therefore $N$.\n\nThis result provides the justification requested by the problem. The general large sieve inequality for a set of $\\delta$-spaced points yields a bound of the form $(L+\\delta^{-1}-1)$ where $L$ is the length of the trigonometric polynomial. In our problem, $L = 2M+1$ and the spacing is $\\delta=1/N$. This would suggest a bound of the form $2M+N$. The so-called \"$Q^2$\" term arises in arithmetic contexts where points are Farey fractions with denominator up to $Q$, and the bound is roughly $L+Q^2$. For the highly structured set of points $\\alpha_j=j/N$, the situation is much simpler. The term \"explicit Gram matrix computation\" refers to the calculation of the eigenvalues of $G$ or, as we have done, the related matrix $T^*T$. Our finding that $T^*T=N \\cdot I$ is a direct consequence of the orthogonality relations for characters on $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$, which is only applicable due to the regular spacing of the points. This \"perfect\" orthogonality, guaranteed by the condition $2M+1 \\le N$, ensures that the cross-terms in the expansion of $\\|Ta\\|^2$ vanish in a particular basis, simplifying the problem dramatically. For general point sets, this orthogonality is lost, the off-diagonal terms of $T^*T$ are non-zero, and the largest eigenvalue is larger and more difficult to estimate, leading to the more complex general bounds. In this special case, the largest eigenvalue is exactly $N$, demonstrating that any additional terms are unnecessary.\n\nThe exact closed-form expression for the largest eigenvalue of $G$ is $N$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{N}$$", "id": "3027660"}, {"introduction": "In practice, the sets of points we care about are rarely as uniform as in the previous exercise, but they often possess some arithmetic structure.

Since $j,l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, K-1\\}$ and $j \\neq l$, the difference $j-l$ is a non-zero integer in the range $[-(K-1), K-1]$.
