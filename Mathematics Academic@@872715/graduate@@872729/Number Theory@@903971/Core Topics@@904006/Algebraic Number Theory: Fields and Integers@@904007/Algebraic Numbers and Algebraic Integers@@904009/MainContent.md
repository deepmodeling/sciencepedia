## Introduction
In the landscape of modern mathematics, algebraic numbers and [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672) stand as a cornerstone of number theory, providing a powerful generalization of the familiar rational numbers and integers. These concepts allow us to explore the arithmetic of number systems far richer and more complex than the rationals, opening up new worlds of mathematical structure. Historically, the study of these objects was motivated by attempts to solve Diophantine equations and prove results like Fermat's Last Theorem, which led to the discovery that [unique factorization](@entry_id:152313) of numbers does not hold in all algebraic systems. This challenge necessitated a deeper, more abstract framework to restore arithmetic order.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of this framework. In the first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," we will rigorously define [algebraic numbers](@entry_id:150888) and integers, investigate their structural properties in number fields, and introduce key tools like the minimal polynomial, norm, and trace. The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," will showcase how this theory provides the foundation for solving concrete problems and connects number theory to diverse fields such as [elliptic curves](@entry_id:152409) and group theory. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer opportunities to apply these concepts to specific computational problems. We begin our journey by delving into the fundamental definitions and structural properties that form the bedrock of [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) theory.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the foundational concepts of algebraic number theory: algebraic numbers and [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672). We will define these objects rigorously, explore their structural properties, and introduce the primary [algebraic structures](@entry_id:139459) built upon them, namely [number fields](@entry_id:155558) and their [rings of integers](@entry_id:181003). The key invariants associated with these structures, such as norm, trace, and the [ideal class group](@entry_id:153974), will be developed from first principles.

### Fundamental Definitions: Algebraic Numbers and Integers

Our study begins with the central objects of interest. An **algebraic number** is a complex number $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ that is a root of a non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients. That is, there exists a non-zero polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$ [@problem_id:3007366]. For example, $\sqrt{2}$ is an algebraic number because it is a root of $f(x) = x^2 - 2$. Complex numbers that are not algebraic are called **transcendental numbers**; famous examples include $\pi$ and $e$.

A seemingly more restrictive, but ultimately equivalent, definition can be formulated using polynomials with integer coefficients. A complex number $\alpha$ is algebraic if and only if there exists a non-zero polynomial $g(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $g(\alpha) = 0$. The proof of this equivalence is straightforward. If such a $g(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ exists, it is also in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, so $\alpha$ is algebraic. Conversely, if $\alpha$ is a root of $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, we can find a common multiple $L$ of the denominators of the coefficients of $f(x)$ and consider the polynomial $g(x) = L \cdot f(x)$. This $g(x)$ is a non-zero polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and satisfies $g(\alpha) = L \cdot f(\alpha) = 0$ [@problem_id:3007366]. This equivalence is a useful technical convenience, allowing us to work with [integer polynomials](@entry_id:154064) when studying [algebraic numbers](@entry_id:150888). It also implies that a number is transcendental if and only if it is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients [@problem_id:3007366].

The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is a subset of the algebraic numbers. For any rational number $r = a/b$ with $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \neq 0$, we can construct the polynomial $f(x) = bx - a$. This is a non-zero polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, and clearly $f(r) = b(a/b) - a = 0$. Thus, every rational number is algebraic [@problem_id:3007366].

Within the vast set of [algebraic numbers](@entry_id:150888), a special subset is of paramount importance: the [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672). An **[algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088)** is a complex number that is a root of a **monic** polynomial with integer coefficients. A [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) is one whose leading coefficient is 1. That is, $\alpha$ is an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) if there exists a polynomial $h(x) = x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + c_0$ with all $c_i \in \mathbb{Z}$, such that $h(\alpha) = 0$ [@problem_id:3007378].

Every [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) is, by definition, an [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710). However, the converse is not true. The monic requirement is a significant restriction. Consider the rational number $\alpha = 1/2$. We know it is algebraic, being a root of $2x-1=0$. Is it an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088)? If it were, it would be a root of some [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) $h(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. However, the Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root $p/q$ (in lowest terms) of such a polynomial must have a denominator $q$ that divides the leading coefficient, which is 1. For $\alpha = 1/2$, the denominator is $2$, which does not divide $1$. Therefore, $1/2$ cannot be a root of any monic integer polynomial and is not an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) [@problem_id:3007366].

This example is a specific instance of a general and crucial theorem: a rational number is an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) if and only if it is an integer. The proof is a direct generalization of the argument for $1/2$. Let $r = a/b \in \mathbb{Q}$ be an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088), with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. It satisfies an equation $r^n + c_{n-1}r^{n-1} + \dots + c_0 = 0$ for $c_i \in \mathbb{Z}$. Substituting $r=a/b$ and multiplying by $b^n$ gives $a^n + c_{n-1}a^{n-1}b + \dots + c_0b^n = 0$. Rearranging, we see that $a^n = -b(c_{n-1}a^{n-1} + \dots + c_0b^{n-1})$, which implies that $b$ divides $a^n$. Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, this can only be true if $b = \pm 1$. Thus, $r = \pm a$ must be an integer [@problem_id:1805222] [@problem_id:3007378]. The converse is trivial: any integer $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a root of the [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) $x-m=0$.

### The Minimal Polynomial and Degree

For any algebraic number $\alpha$, there are many polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ that have $\alpha$ as a root. Among these, there is one that is unique and of fundamental importance. The **[minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598)** of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, denoted $m_{\alpha}(x)$, is the unique [monic polynomial](@entry_id:152311) in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of the smallest possible degree that has $\alpha$ as a root. A key property of the minimal polynomial is that it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Any other polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ with $f(\alpha)=0$ is a multiple of $m_{\alpha}(x)$ in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. The **degree** of an [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) $\alpha$ is defined as the degree of its minimal polynomial.

Let's construct some examples [@problem_id:3007346].
-   For $\alpha = \sqrt{7}$, we see that $\alpha^2 - 7 = 0$. The polynomial $x^2 - 7$ is monic. It is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, which can be verified using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=7$. Thus, $m_{\sqrt{7}}(x) = x^2-7$, and the degree of $\sqrt{7}$ is 2.
-   For $\beta = \sqrt[3]{19}$, we have $\beta^3 - 19 = 0$. The polynomial $x^3 - 19$ is monic and is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=19$. So, $m_{\sqrt[3]{19}}(x) = x^3 - 19$, and the degree of $\sqrt[3]{19}$ is 3.
-   For $\gamma = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$, a bit of algebra is needed. Squaring gives $\gamma^2 = 5 + 2\sqrt{6}$. Rearranging and squaring again yields $(\gamma^2 - 5)^2 = 24$, which simplifies to $\gamma^4 - 10\gamma^2 + 1 = 0$. The polynomial $m_{\gamma}(x) = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1$ is monic. One can show it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by verifying it has no rational roots and cannot be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients. Therefore, the degree of $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ is 4.

The concept of the minimal polynomial provides a powerful characterization of [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672). An algebraic number $\alpha$ is an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) if and only if its minimal polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, $m_{\alpha}(x)$, has all its coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$. The "if" direction is immediate from the definitions. The "only if" direction is a deeper result that follows from Gauss's Lemma on [polynomial factorization](@entry_id:151396). If $\alpha$ is an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088), it is a root of some monic $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. Its [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) $m_{\alpha}(x)$ must divide $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Gauss's Lemma implies that since both polynomials are monic, the coefficients of $m_{\alpha}(x)$ must also be integers [@problem_id:3007378]. This means that to check if an [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) is an integer, we only need to compute its minimal polynomial and inspect its coefficients.

### The Ring of Algebraic Integers and Number Fields

The sets of [algebraic numbers](@entry_id:150888) and [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672) possess rich [algebraic structures](@entry_id:139459). The set of all [algebraic numbers](@entry_id:150888), often denoted $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, forms a field. This means it is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (by non-zero elements). If $\alpha \neq 0$ is algebraic, its inverse $\alpha^{-1}$ is also algebraic. This can be seen by taking the polynomial equation $c_n\alpha^n + \dots + c_1\alpha + c_0 = 0$ and dividing by $\alpha^n$, which yields a polynomial equation for $\alpha^{-1}$ [@problem_id:3007366]. The proof that $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is closed under addition and multiplication is typically shown using the theory of [field extensions](@entry_id:153187). Moreover, the field $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is algebraically closed. While it is an infinite field, the set of algebraic numbers is countable, as it is a countable union of the finite sets of [roots of polynomials](@entry_id:154615) with integer coefficients [@problem_id:3007366].

Even more remarkably, the set of all [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672) forms a ring. This means it is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Proving this directly from the definition is not straightforward. A more powerful characterization is needed: a complex number $x$ is an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) if and only if the ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (the set of all polynomial expressions in $x$ with integer coefficients) is a finitely generated module over $\mathbb{Z}$ [@problem_id:3007378]. This module-theoretic viewpoint is key to proving that sums and products of [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672) are also [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672).

In practice, we are often interested in the algebraic numbers and integers that lie within a specific [subfield](@entry_id:155812) of $\mathbb{C}$. A **[number field](@entry_id:148388)** $K$ is a field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ that has finite dimension as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. This dimension, denoted $[K:\mathbb{Q}]$, is called the degree of the extension. Every element of a number field is an [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710).

Within any [number field](@entry_id:148388) $K$, the set of all [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672) forms a ring, called the **ring of integers** of $K$ and denoted by $\mathcal{O}_K$. Formally, $\mathcal{O}_K$ is the set of elements in $K$ that are integral over $\mathbb{Z}$; it is the **integral closure** of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$ [@problem_id:3007367]. This ring $\mathcal{O}_K$ plays a role in the number field $K$ that is analogous to the role of $\mathbb{Z}$ in the field $\mathbb{Q}$. The ring $\mathcal{O}_K$ is itself **integrally closed**, meaning any element of $K$ that is integral over $\mathcal{O}_K$ must already be in $\mathcal{O}_K$ [@problem_id:3007367].

Determining the [ring of integers](@entry_id:155711) for a given [number field](@entry_id:148388) is a non-trivial task. For a [quadratic field](@entry_id:636261) $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer, the ring of integers is given by:
-   $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] = \{a + b\sqrt{d} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ if $d \equiv 2$ or $3 \pmod{4}$.
-   $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right] = \{a + b\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ if $d \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

This shows that the "obvious" candidate ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is not always the full ring of integers. A subring of $\mathcal{O}_K$ that is also a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module of full rank is called an **order**. $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is always an order, but it is only the **maximal order** ($\mathcal{O}_K$ itself) when $d \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$. When $d \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is a proper subring of $\mathcal{O}_K$, and the index of the [additive group](@entry_id:151801) of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ in $\mathcal{O}_K$ is $[\mathcal{O}_K : \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]] = 2$ [@problem_id:3007381].

### Embeddings, Norm, and Trace

A powerful tool for studying a number field $K$ is the set of its [embeddings](@entry_id:158103) into the complex numbers. A **field embedding** is a homomorphism $\sigma: K \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that fixes the rational numbers. The number of such embeddings is exactly equal to the degree of the field, $[K:\mathbb{Q}]$.

An embedding $\sigma$ is called **real** if its image lies entirely in $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $\sigma(K) \subset \mathbb{R}$. Otherwise, it is called a **complex** embedding. Complex embeddings come in conjugate pairs: if $\sigma$ is a complex embedding, then the map $\overline{\sigma}$ (defined by $\overline{\sigma}(x) = \overline{\sigma(x)}$) is another distinct embedding. The **signature** of a [number field](@entry_id:148388) $K$ is the pair $(r_1, r_2)$, where $r_1$ is the number of real embeddings and $r_2$ is the number of pairs of [complex conjugate](@entry_id:174888) embeddings. These numbers are related to the degree by the fundamental formula $[K:\mathbb{Q}] = r_1 + 2r_2$.

For example, consider the field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt[3]{2})$. Its degree is $[K:\mathbb{Q}] = 6$. An embedding $\sigma$ is determined by where it sends the generators $\sqrt{5}$ and $\sqrt[3]{2}$. $\sigma(\sqrt{5})$ must be a root of $x^2-5=0$ (i.e., $\pm\sqrt{5}$), and $\sigma(\sqrt[3]{2})$ must be a root of $x^3-2=0$ (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega$, or $\sqrt[3]{2}\omega^2$, where $\omega$ is a complex cube root of unity). An embedding is real if and only if both $\sigma(\sqrt{5})$ and $\sigma(\sqrt[3]{2})$ are real. There are two real choices for $\sigma(\sqrt{5})$ but only one for $\sigma(\sqrt[3]{2})$. This gives $r_1 = 2 \times 1 = 2$ real [embeddings](@entry_id:158103). From the degree formula, $6 = 2 + 2r_2$, we find $r_2=2$. Thus, the signature of $K$ is $(2, 2)$ [@problem_id:3007357].

The embeddings provide a natural way to define two crucial invariants for any element $\alpha \in K$: the **trace** and the **norm**. Let $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n$ be the $n = [K:\mathbb{Q}]$ distinct embeddings of $K$ into $\mathbb{C}$. The [trace and norm](@entry_id:155207) of $\alpha$ are defined as:
-   **Trace**: $\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(\alpha)$
-   **Norm**: $\mathrm{N}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = \prod_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(\alpha)$

For a [quadratic field](@entry_id:636261) $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, there are two [embeddings](@entry_id:158103): the identity ($\sigma_1(a+b\sqrt{d}) = a+b\sqrt{d}$) and conjugation ($\sigma_2(a+b\sqrt{d}) = a-b\sqrt{d}$). The formulas for [trace and norm](@entry_id:155207) become particularly simple [@problem_id:3007391]:
-   $\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\sqrt{d}) = (a+b\sqrt{d}) + (a-b\sqrt{d}) = 2a$
-   $\mathrm{N}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\sqrt{d}) = (a+b\sqrt{d})(a-b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - b^2d$

The trace is an additive homomorphism ($\mathrm{Tr}(\alpha+\beta) = \mathrm{Tr}(\alpha)+\mathrm{Tr}(\beta)$) and the norm is a multiplicative homomorphism ($\mathrm{N}(\alpha\beta) = \mathrm{N}(\alpha)\mathrm{N}(\beta)$). The multiplicativity of the norm follows directly from the fact that [embeddings](@entry_id:158103) are multiplicative homomorphisms [@problem_id:3007391].

The [trace and norm](@entry_id:155207) are rational numbers for any $\alpha \in K$. Furthermore, if $\alpha$ is an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088) in $\mathcal{O}_K$, its [trace and norm](@entry_id:155207) are integers. This is because the set of conjugates $\{\sigma_i(\alpha)\}$ are the roots of the [minimal polynomial](@entry_id:153598) of $\alpha$ (counted with multiplicity), and these conjugates are themselves [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672). Their [elementary symmetric polynomials](@entry_id:152224) (like the sum and product) are therefore also [algebraic integers](@entry_id:151672). Since they are also rational numbers, they must be integers. The converse, however, is not generally true: an element with integer [trace and norm](@entry_id:155207) is not necessarily an [algebraic integer](@entry_id:155088), except in special cases like [quadratic fields](@entry_id:154272) [@problem_id:3007378]. The [trace and norm](@entry_id:155207) are related to the minimal polynomial. If $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ and $m_{\alpha}(x) = x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + c_0$, then $\mathrm{Tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = -c_{n-1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = (-1)^n c_0$ [@problem_id:3007346].

### Ideals in the Ring of Integers

One of the primary motivations for the development of [algebraic number](@entry_id:156710) theory was the [failure of unique factorization](@entry_id:155196) into prime elements in many [rings of integers](@entry_id:181003). For example, in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, the number 6 has two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements: $6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$.

The profound insight of Ernst Kummer and Richard Dedekind was that [unique factorization](@entry_id:152313) can be restored if one moves from factoring elements to factoring **ideals**. A key theorem states that every ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a **Dedekind domain**. This has a crucial consequence: every non-zero ideal in $\mathcal{O}_K$ can be written as a product of [prime ideals](@entry_id:154026), and this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors [@problem_id:3007356].

To quantify the extent to which $\mathcal{O}_K$ fails to be a [unique factorization domain](@entry_id:155710) (UFD) for elements, one introduces the **ideal class group**. This is constructed from the group of **fractional ideals** $I_K$, which are finitely generated $\mathcal{O}_K$-submodules of $K$. Within this group, the **principal fractional ideals** (those of the form $\alpha\mathcal{O}_K$ for some $\alpha \in K^\times$) form a subgroup $P_K$. The [ideal class group](@entry_id:153974) is the quotient group $\mathrm{Cl}_K = I_K / P_K$ [@problem_id:3007356]. Two ideals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ are in the same class if there is some element $x \in K^\times$ such that $\mathfrak{a} = x\mathfrak{b}$ [@problem_id:3007356].

The ideal class group is trivial (i.e., has only one element) if and only if every [fractional ideal](@entry_id:204191) is principal. For a Dedekind domain like $\mathcal{O}_K$, being a [principal ideal domain](@entry_id:152359) (PID) is equivalent to being a UFD. Therefore, $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a UFD if and only if its [ideal class group](@entry_id:153974) $\mathrm{Cl}_K$ is trivial [@problem_id:3007356]. A deep and fundamental theorem of the subject states that the [ideal class group](@entry_id:153974) of any number field is a finite abelian group. Its size, the **[class number](@entry_id:156164)** $h_K = |\mathrm{Cl}_K|$, serves as a primary measure of the [failure of unique factorization](@entry_id:155196).

The [unique factorization of ideals](@entry_id:154997) in $\mathcal{O}_K$ allows us to study how rational primes behave in a number field. Given a prime number $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, the [principal ideal](@entry_id:152760) $p\mathcal{O}_K$ it generates in $\mathcal{O}_K$ is generally not a [prime ideal](@entry_id:149360). It factors into a product of prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}_K$:
$$ p\mathcal{O}_K = \mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1} \mathfrak{p}_2^{e_2} \cdots \mathfrak{p}_g^{e_g} $$
Here, the $\mathfrak{p}_i$ are the distinct prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}_K$ that lie above $p$ (meaning $\mathfrak{p}_i \cap \mathbb{Z} = p\mathbb{Z}$). The exponent $e_i$ is called the **[ramification index](@entry_id:186386)** of $\mathfrak{p}_i$ over $p$. It is the largest integer $k$ such that $\mathfrak{p}_i^k$ divides $p\mathcal{O}_K$ [@problem_id:3007355]. The other important invariant is the **[inertia degree](@entry_id:195604)** $f_i$, defined as the degree of the residue [field extension](@entry_id:150367) $f_i = [\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{p}_i : \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}]$. Since $\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{p}_i$ is a finite field containing $\mathbb{F}_p = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, its cardinality is $p^{f_i}$ [@problem_id:3007355].

These indices are constrained by the degree of the number field via the fundamental relation:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^g e_i f_i = [K:\mathbb{Q}] $$
This formula is central to understanding [prime decomposition](@entry_id:198620). If the extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois, the situation simplifies greatly: the Galois group acts transitively on the [prime ideals](@entry_id:154026) $\{\mathfrak{p}_i\}$, forcing all the ramification indices and all the inertia degrees to be equal ($e_1=\dots=e_g=e$ and $f_1=\dots=f_g=f$). In this case, the formula becomes $efg = [K:\mathbb{Q}]$ [@problem_id:3007355]. These concepts form the gateway to the more advanced study of [splitting of primes](@entry_id:201129), [reciprocity laws](@entry_id:188215), and [class field theory](@entry_id:155687).
