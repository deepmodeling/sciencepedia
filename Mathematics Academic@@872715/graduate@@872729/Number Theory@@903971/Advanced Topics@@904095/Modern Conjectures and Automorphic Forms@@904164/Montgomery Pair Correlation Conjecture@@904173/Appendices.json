The expectation on the right-hand side of the definition can be expressed using the second factorial moment density, also known as the two-point correlation function $\\rho^{(2)}(x, y)$, which gives the density of finding distinct points at locations $x$ and $y$. The general formula is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sum_{\\substack{x_{m},x_{n}\\in X\\cap A\\\\ m\\neq n}} g(x_m, x_n)\\right] = \\int_{A} \\int_{A} g(x,y) \\rho^{(2)}(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nIn our case, the set is $A = [-L/2, L/2]$ and the function is $g(x_m, x_n) = f(x_n - x_m)$.\nFor a homogeneous Poisson process of intensity $\\lambda$, the positions of the points are statistically independent. This means the joint probability density of finding points at $x$ and $y$ is simply the product of their individual densities, i.e., $\\rho^{(2)}(x,y) = \\lambda \\times \\lambda = \\lambda^2$.\nGiven that the process has unit intensity, $\\lambda=1$, we have $\\rho^{(2)}(x,y) = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nSubstituting this into the definition of the distinct-pair correlation measure:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(s)\\,R_{2}^{\\mathrm{nd}}(s)\\,ds = \\lim_{L\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{L}\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} f(y-x)\\, (1) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nWe evaluate the double integral by a change of variables. Let $s = y-x$ and $u = x$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $1$. The integration domain is a square in the $(x,y)$-plane defined by $-L/2 \\le x \\le L/2$ and $-L/2 \\le y \\le L/2$. In terms of the new variables $(u,s)$, the inequalities become $-L/2 \\le u \\le L/2$ and $-L/2 \\le s+u \\le L/2$.\nRearranging the second inequality gives $-L/2 - u \\le s \\le L/2 - u$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\left( \\int_{-L/2-u}^{L/2-u} f(s) \\,ds \\right) du\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we change the order of integration. The range of $s$ is from $(-L/2 - L/2) = -L$ to $(L/2 - (-L/2)) = L$. For a fixed $s$ in $[-L, L]$, the range for $u$ is determined by the intersection of the intervals $[-L/2, L/2]$ and $[-L/2-s, L/2-s]$. The length of this intersection is $L-|s|$.\nSo, the double integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{-L}^{L} f(s) (L-|s|) \\,ds\n$$\nNow we substitute this back into the defining limit:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(s)\\,R_{2}^{\\mathrm{nd}}(s)\\,ds = \\lim_{L\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L}^{L} f(s) (L-|s|) \\,ds = \\lim_{L\\to\\infty} \\int_{-L}^{L} f(s) \\left(1-\\frac{|s|}{L}\\right) \\,ds\n$$\nSince $f$ is a Schwartz function, it is absolutely integrable. The integrand $f(s)(1-|s|/L)$ is dominated by $|f(s)|$. As $L \\to \\infty$, the term $|s|/L \\to 0$ for any fixed $s$, and the domain of integration extends to the entire real line. By the dominated convergence theorem, we can take the limit inside the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(s) \\lim_{L\\to\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{|s|}{L}\\right) \\,ds = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(s) \\cdot 1 \\,ds\n$$\nWe have thus shown that for any Schwartz test function $f$,\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(s)\\,R_{2}^{\\mathrm{nd}}(s)\\,ds = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(s)\\,ds\n$$\nThis implies that, in the sense of distributions, $R_{2}^{\\mathrm{nd}}(s) = 1$. This result is intuitive: for a Poisson process, the locations of points are uncorrelated, so the density of finding a point at any distance $s$ from another point is simply the average intensity of the process, which is $\\lambda=1$.\n\nNext, we compute the connected two-level cluster function $Y_{2}(s)$:\n$$\nY_{2}(s) = R_{2}^{\\mathrm{nd}}(s) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe function $Y_{2}(s)$ is identically zero for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the form factor $F(\\alpha)$ by taking the Fourier transform of $Y_{2}(s)$:\n$$\nF(\\alpha) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Y_{2}(s)\\,\\exp(-2\\pi i\\,\\alpha s)\\,ds = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\cdot \\exp(-2\\pi i\\,\\alpha s)\\,ds = 0\n$$\nThus, for the homogeneous Poisson model, the form factor is $F(\\alpha)=0$.\n\nThe problem also asks for a brief articulation of how this result differs from the behavior observed for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE).\nThe result for the Poisson model, $F(\\alpha) = 0$, signifies a complete absence of correlations between the points once the mean density is accounted for. The connected two-level cluster function $Y_2(s)$ is zero, indicating statistical independence.\nIn stark contrast, the GUE exhibits strong correlations. For unfolded eigenvalues with unit mean spacing, the GUE's connected two-level cluster function is $Y_{2,\\text{GUE}}(s) = -(\\sin(\\pi s)/(\\pi s))^2$. Its Fourier transform, the form factor $F_{\\text{GUE}}(\\alpha)$, is non-zero. A standard calculation yields $F_{\\text{GUE}}(\\alpha) = |\\alpha|-1$ for $|\\alpha| \\le 1$ and $F_{\\text{GUE}}(\\alpha) = 0$ for $|\\alpha|>1$.\nThe behavior near the origin for the GUE model is $F_{\\text{GUE}}(\\alpha) \\approx |\\alpha|-1$. The term \"linear frequency-side form factor\" refers to the emergence of the $|\\alpha|$ term, a feature often called the \"linear ramp\". This non-trivial structure in $F_{\\text{GUE}}(\\alpha)$ is a hallmark of the spectral rigidity and level repulsion characteristic of GUE statistics, phenomena that are entirely absent in the uncorrelated Poisson model.

It is proportional to the probability density of finding two levels separated by a normalized distance $u$.\n\nThe key features of our result, $R_{2}(u) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{3}u^{2}$ for small $u$, are the power of $u$ and the sign of the coefficient.\n\n$1$. Power of $u$: The function vanishes as $u \\to 0$, since $R_2(u) \\propto u^2$. This indicates that the probability of finding two zeros arbitrarily close to each other is zero. This phenomenon is known as \"level repulsion\" in the language of quantum chaos and random matrix theory. The levels (zeros) behave as if they repel each other.\n\n$2$. Quadratic Dependence: The leading term is proportional to $u^{2}$. The exponent, $2$, in the leading term $u^2$ dictates the nature of the repulsion. A dependence of the form $R_{2}(u) \\propto u^{\\beta}$ for small $u$ is characteristic of random matrix ensembles, where $\\beta = 1$ (linear repulsion) corresponds to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), $\\beta = 2$ (quadratic repulsion) corresponds to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), and $\\beta = 4$ (quartic repulsion) corresponds to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). The result $R_{2}(u) \\propto u^{2}$ therefore signifies *quadratic* level repulsion, which is the hallmark of GUE statistics. The conjecture's connection to GUE is profound because GUE typically models the spectra of complex quantum systems that lack time-reversal symmetry.\n\n$3$. Sign of the Coefficient: The coefficient $c = \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{3}$ is positive. This is a necessary condition for $R_{2}(u)$ to represent a probability density for small, positive $u$. A negative coefficient would imply a negative probability, which is physically and mathematically meaningless. The positive sign ensures that the probability of finding two levels at a small separation $u > 0$ is a small, positive number.\n\nIn summary, the form $R_{2}(u) \\approx c u^2$ with $c>0$ shows that the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function exhibit quadratic level repulsion at short distances, a statistical behavior identical to that of the eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices from the GUE.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3018999"}, {"introduction": "The connection between the Riemann zeros and random matrix theory can be viewed from two equivalent perspectives: real space, focusing on spacings, and frequency space, focusing on the form factor.

This requires $|\\tau| \\leq 1/2$ and $|\\alpha-\\tau| \\leq 1/2$. The second condition is equivalent to $\\alpha-1/2 \\leq \\tau \\leq \\alpha+1/2$. The region of integration for $\\tau$ is the intersection of the intervals $[-1/2, 1/2]$ and $[\\alpha-1/2, \\alpha+1/2]$. An overlap exists only if $-1 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$. For $|\\alpha| > 1$, the convolution is $0$.\nFor $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$, the integration interval is $[\\alpha-1/2, 1/2]$, and the integral is the length of this interval:\n$$\n\\int_{\\alpha-1/2}^{1/2} 1 \\,d\\tau \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; 1 - \\alpha\n$$\nFor $\\alpha \\in [-1, 0)$, the integration interval is $[-1/2, \\alpha+1/2]$, and the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{-1/2}^{\\alpha+1/2} 1 \\,d\\tau \\;=\\; \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\alpha + 1\n$$\nCombining these cases, the result is $1-|\\alpha|$ for $|\\alpha| \\leq 1$.
