The point at infinity, $\\infty$, is represented as $1/0$, for which we take $a=1$, $c=0$, and $\\gcd(1,0)=1$ by convention. The width $w_{a/c}$ of the cusp $a/c$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $w$ for which the matrix conjugation $\\sigma T^{w} \\sigma^{-1}$ is an element of $\\Gamma_{0}(N)$. Here, $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the standard translation matrix in $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$, and $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a scaling matrix satisfying $\\sigma(\\infty) = a/c$.\n\nFirst, we determine the general form of the scaling matrix $\\sigma$. Let $\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ be a matrix in $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$. The action of $\\sigma$ on $\\infty$ is given by the fractional linear transformation:\n$$ \\sigma(\\infty) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{pz+q}{rz+s} = \\frac{p}{r} $$\nThe condition $\\sigma(\\infty) = a/c$ implies $p/r = a/c$. Since the fraction $a/c$ is in lowest terms ($\\gcd(a,c)=1$) and $p, r$ are integers, it must be the case that $p=ka$ and $r=kc$ for some non-zero integer $k$. The determinant of $\\sigma$ must be $1$:\n$$ ps - qr = 1 \\implies (ka)s - q(kc) = 1 \\implies k(as-qc) = 1 $$\nSince $a, c, q, s, k$ are all integers, this implies that $k$ must be either $1$ or $-1$. We can choose $k=1$ without loss of generality, which gives $p=a$ and $r=c$. The determinant condition then becomes $as-qc=1$. By Bézout's identity, since $\\gcd(a,c)=1$, such integers $q$ and $s$ are guaranteed to exist. Thus, a valid choice for the scaling matrix is $\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & q \\\\ c & s \\end{pmatrix}$ where $as-qc=1$.\n\nNext, we must justify that the definition of the width $w_{a/c}$ is independent of the specific choice of $\\sigma$. Let $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ be two scaling matrices in $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$ mapping $\\infty$ to $a/c$. Then $\\sigma_2(\\infty) = a/c$, which implies $\\sigma_2^{-1}(a/c) = \\infty$. Applying $\\sigma_2^{-1}$ to the equation $\\sigma_1(\\infty) = a/c$ gives $\\sigma_2^{-1}\\sigma_1(\\infty) = \\infty$. This means the matrix $\\sigma_2^{-1}\\sigma_1$ is in the stabilizer of $\\infty$ in $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})$, denoted $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})_\\infty$. The elements of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})_\\infty$ are of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}$ with determinant $\\alpha\\delta=1$. For integer entries, this requires $(\\alpha,\\delta) = (1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$. So, any element of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbb{Z})_\\infty$ is of the form $\\pm T^m$ for some integer $m$.\nThus, $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 (\\pm T^m)$. Let $w$ be the width determined using $\\sigma_1$. The condition is $\\sigma_1 T^w \\sigma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$. Substituting the expression for $\\sigma_1$:\n$$ \\sigma_1 T^w \\sigma_1^{-1} = \\left( \\sigma_2 (\\pm T^m) \\right) T^w \\left( \\sigma_2 (\\pm T^m) \\right)^{-1} = \\sigma_2 (\\pm T^m) T^w (\\pm T^m)^{-1} \\sigma_2^{-1} $$\nSince $-I$ is a central element, $(\\pm I)^{-1} = \\pm I$, and the signs cancel. As powers of $T$ commute, $T^m T^w T^{-m} = T^w$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma_2 T^w \\sigma_2^{-1} $$\nThe condition $\\sigma_1 T^w \\sigma_1^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$ is therefore equivalent to $\\sigma_2 T^w \\sigma_2^{-1} \\in \\Gamma_0(N)$. Since the condition is identical for any valid scaling matrix, the smallest positive integer $w$ satisfying it is unique. Hence, the width $w_{a/c}$ is well-defined.\n\nWe now proceed to derive the expression for $w_{a/c}$. We use the matrix $\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & q \\\\ c & s \\end{pmatrix}$ with $as-qc=1$. Its inverse is $\\sigma^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} s & -q \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}$. The $w$-th power of the translation matrix is $T^w = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & w \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute the conjugate matrix:\n$$ \\sigma T^w \\sigma^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & q \\\\ c & s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & w \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s & -q \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ = \\begin{pmatrix} a & aw+q \\\\ c & cw+s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s & -q \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ = \\begin{pmatrix} as - c(aw+q) & -aq + a(aw+q) \\\\ cs - c(cw+s) & -cq + a(cw+s) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUsing the relation $as-qc=1$, we simplify the entries of the resulting matrix:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Top-left: $as - acw - cq = (as-cq) - acw = 1 - acw$\n    \\item Top-right: $-aq + a^2w + aq = a^2w$\n    \\item Bottom-left: $cs - c^2w - cs = -c^2w$\n    \\item Bottom-right: $-cq + acw + as = (as-cq) + acw = 1 + acw$\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, we have $\\sigma T^w \\sigma^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - acw & a^2w \\\\ -c^2w & 1 + acw \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor this matrix to be in $\\Gamma_0(N)$, its lower-left entry must be congruent to $0$ modulo $N$.\n$$ -c^2w \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N} \\quad \\iff \\quad c^2w \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N} $$\nThis congruence means that $N$ must divide $c^2w$. We seek the smallest positive integer $w$ for which this is true. Let $d = \\gcd(c^2, N)$. We can write $N = d \\cdot (N/d)$ and $c^2 = d \\cdot (c^2/d)$. The congruence becomes:\n$$ d \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{d} \\cdot w \\equiv 0 \\pmod{d \\cdot \\frac{N}{d}} $$\nThis is equivalent to $N \\mid c^2w$, which can be written as $\\frac{N}{d} \\mid \\frac{c^2}{d} w$.\nBy the definition of the greatest common divisor, the integers $N/d$ and $c^2/d$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(N/d, c^2/d)=1$.\nTherefore, for $N/d$ to divide the product $(c^2/d)w$, it must divide $w$.\n$$ \\frac{N}{d} \\mid w \\quad \\iff \\quad \\frac{N}{\\gcd(c^2, N)} \\mid w $$\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $w$ that satisfies this divisibility condition. The smallest such $w$ is precisely the divisor itself:\n$$ w = \\frac{N}{\\gcd(c^2, N)} $$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the width of the cusp $a/c$ in terms of $N$ and the denominator $c$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{N}{\\gcd(c^2, N)}} $$", "id": "3018285"}, {"introduction": "This exercise provides a complete case study of the modular curve $X_0(36)$, guiding you through the computation of all its essential geometric invariants.

Since $4|12$, we have $\\nu_2 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Number of elliptic points of order 3, $\\nu_3$**: The number of elliptic points of order $3$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is given by $\\nu_3 = \\prod_{p|N} (1 + (\\frac{-3}{p}))$ if $3 \\nmid N$. This formula is not quite right. A better way is to count solutions to $x^2+x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod N$. For $N=12$, this is equivalent to the system:\n    \\begin{cases} x^2+x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4 \\\\ x^2+x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 \\end{cases}\n    The first congruence, $x^2+x+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, has no solutions, as squares modulo 4 are 0 and 1.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item $x=0$: $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$\n        \\item $x=1$: $3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$\n        \\item $x=2$: $7 \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$\n        \\item $x=3$: $13 \\equiv 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    Since there is no solution modulo $4$, there is no solution modulo $12$. Therefore, $\\nu_3=0$.\n\n5.  **Genus of $X_0(12)$**: The genus $g$ of $X_0(N)$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ g(X_0(N)) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_N}{12} - \\frac{\\nu_2}{4} - \\frac{\\nu_3}{3} - \\frac{\\nu_\\infty}{2} $$\n    Substituting our computed values for $N=12$:\n    $$ g(X_0(12)) = 1 + \\frac{24}{12} - \\frac{0}{4} - \\frac{0}{3} - \\frac{6}{2} = 1 + 2 - 0 - 0 - 3 = 0 $$\n    The genus of $X_0(12)$ is $0$.\n\nNow we have all the required components to calculate the dimensions for weight $k=10$.\n\n**Dimension of the space of cusp forms $S_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12))$**:\nUsing the formula for $\\dim S_k$ with $k=10$, $g=0$, $\\nu_\\infty=6$, $\\nu_2=0$, and $\\nu_3=0$:\n$$ \\dim S_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12)) = (10-1)(0-1) + \\left(\\frac{10}{2} - 1\\right)(6) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{4} \\right\\rfloor(0) + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3} \\right\\rfloor(0) $$\n$$ \\dim S_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12)) = (9)(-1) + (5 - 1)(6) + 0 + 0 = -9 + (4)(6) = -9 + 24 = 15 $$\n\n**Dimension of the space of modular forms $M_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12))$**:\nAs established, for $k=10 > 2$, $\\dim M_k = \\dim S_k + \\nu_\\infty$.\n$$ \\dim M_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12)) = 15 + 6 = 21 $$\n\nThe dimensions are therefore $\\dim M_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12), \\chi) = 21$ and $\\dim S_{10}(\\Gamma_0(12), \\chi) = 15$.\nThe final answer is required as a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n21  15\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3018288"}]}
