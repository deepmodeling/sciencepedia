It is a well-posed question in algebraic number theory, based on established principles and free of any scientific or logical flaws. We are asked to derive the conductor of a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ using a specified set of foundational facts.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic field, where $d$ is a squarefree integer. This is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which is abelian. The Kronecker-Weber theorem, given as a foundational fact, states that every finite abelian extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is contained in a cyclotomic field. The conductor of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted $f(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is defined as the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$, where $\\zeta_m = \\exp(2\\pi i / m)$.\n\nThe arithmetic of an abelian extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is governed by its character group $X = \\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}), \\mathbb{C}^\\times)$. Since $\\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $2$, the character group $X$ also has order $2$. It consists of the trivial character, which we denote by $1$, and a single non-trivial quadratic character, which we denote by $\\chi_K$.\n\nA fundamental result in analytic number theory relates the Dedekind zeta function of $K$, $\\zeta_K(s)$, to the Dirichlet L-functions associated with the characters in $X$:\n$$\n\\zeta_K(s) = \\prod_{\\chi \\in X} L(s, \\chi)\n$$\nIn our case, $X = \\{1, \\chi_K\\}$, and since $L(s, 1) = \\zeta(s)$ (the Riemann zeta function), this factorization becomes:\n$$\n\\zeta_K(s) = L(s, 1) L(s, \\chi_K) = \\zeta(s) L(s, \\chi_K)\n$$\nThe problem statement provides the identity $\\zeta_K(s) = \\zeta(s) L(s, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})$, where $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}(n) = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{n}\\right)$ is the Dirichlet character given by the Kronecker symbol, and $\\Delta_K$ is the fundamental discriminant of $K$. Comparing these two expressions for $\\zeta_K(s)$, we uniquely identify the non-trivial character of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ as $\\chi_K = \\chi_{\\Delta_K}$.\n\nAccording to the theory of abelian extensions (a consequence of class field theory), the conductor of the extension $f(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by the conductors of the characters in its character group $X$. Specifically, $f(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the least common multiple of the conductors of all characters $\\chi \\in X$:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathrm{lcm}_{\\chi \\in X} \\{ f(\\chi) \\}\n$$\nFor our quadratic field, this is:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathrm{lcm}(f(1), f(\\chi_K))\n$$\nThe conductor of the trivial character $f(1)$ is $1$. Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = f(\\chi_K) = f(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})\n$$\nThe problem is therefore reduced to determining the conductor of the Dirichlet character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$. The character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$ is defined using the Kronecker symbol with the fundamental discriminant $\\Delta_K$. A cornerstone result concerning such characters is that if $D$ is a fundamental discriminant, the character $\\chi_D(n) = \\left(\\frac{D}{n}\\right)$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $|D|$. By definition, the conductor of a primitive character is its modulus.\nSince $\\Delta_K$ is the fundamental discriminant of $K$, the character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$ is a primitive character of modulus $|\\Delta_K|$. Therefore, its conductor is:\n$$\nf(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = |\\Delta_K|\n$$\nCombining our results, we find the conductor of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\nf(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = |\\Delta_K|\n$$\nThis provides the explicit expression for the conductor in terms of the discriminant.\n\nThe second part of the task is to prove that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f(K/\\mathbb{Q})})$. Using our result for the conductor, this is equivalent to proving that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nFirst, we establish that the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is identical to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$.\nCase 1: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = d$. In this case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$ trivially.\nCase 2: $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$. The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = 4d$. The field generated by $\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{4d}) = \\mathbb{Q}(2\\sqrt{d})$. Since $2$ is a rational number, this field is the same as $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$.\nIn all cases, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$. Thus, we need to prove that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nTo prove this inclusion, we use the theory of Gauss sums. Let $\\chi$ be a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $f(\\chi)$. The associated Gauss sum is defined as $\\tau(\\chi) = \\sum_{a=1}^{f(\\chi)} \\chi(a) \\zeta_{f(\\chi)}^a$. By its very definition, the Gauss sum $\\tau(\\chi)$ is an element of the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f(\\chi)})$.\n\nWe consider the Gauss sum for our character $\\chi = \\chi_{\\Delta_K}$, which is primitive with conductor $f(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})=|\\Delta_K|$.\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = \\sum_{a=1}^{|\\Delta_K|} \\chi_{\\Delta_K}(a) \\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|}^a\n$$\nThis sum lies in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nA fundamental identity for the square of a Gauss sum associated with a primitive quadratic character $\\chi$ is:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi)^2 = \\chi(-1) f(\\chi)\n$$\nApplying this to $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$, we get:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})^2 = \\chi_{\\Delta_K}(-1) f(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{-1}\\right) |\\Delta_K|\n$$\nThe value of the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_K}{-1}\\right)$ is $1$ if $\\Delta_K > 0$ and $-1$ if $\\Delta_K  0$. This is precisely the sign of $\\Delta_K$, denoted $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\Delta_K)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K})^2 = \\mathrm{sgn}(\\Delta_K) |\\Delta_K| = \\Delta_K\n$$\nThis implies that $\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = \\pm\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$. Since $\\tau(\\chi_{\\Delta_K}) \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$, it follows that $\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$ must also be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$. This establishes that the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{|\\Delta_K|})$.\n\nAs we showed $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K})$ and determined that $f(K/\\mathbb{Q}) = |\\Delta_K|$, we have proven that $K \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f(K/\\mathbb{Q})})$.

We will determine these by analyzing the Dirichlet character $\\chi$ that defines the extension $K$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the definition of the character $\\chi$. It is a character on the group of units of $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$, which is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. This is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. The problem states that $g=3$ is a generator. We verify this: the powers of $3$ modulo $7$ are $3^1 \\equiv 3$, $3^2 \\equiv 2$, $3^3 \\equiv 6$, $3^4 \\equiv 4$, $3^5 \\equiv 5$, and $3^6 \\equiv 1$. Since the order of $3$ is $6$, it is indeed a generator.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is defined by its value on the generator: $\\chi(3) = \\exp(2\\pi i/3)$. The order of $\\chi$ as an element of the character group is the order of its value $\\exp(2\\pi i/3)$, which is $3$. The image of $\\chi$ is the group of third roots of unity, $\\operatorname{im}(\\chi) = \\{1, \\exp(2\\pi i/3), \\exp(4\\pi i/3)\\}$.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have the isomorphism $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} / \\ker(\\chi) \\cong \\operatorname{im}(\\chi)$. This implies that the index of the kernel is equal to the order of the image: $[(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} : \\ker(\\chi)] = |\\operatorname{im}(\\chi)| = 3$. The kernel $\\ker(\\chi)$ is a subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ of order $6/3 = 2$. Specifically, $\\ker(\\chi) = \\{a \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\mid \\chi(a) = 1\\}$. Since $\\chi(3^k) = (\\exp(2\\pi i/3))^k$, we need $k$ to be a multiple of $3$. Thus, $\\ker(\\chi) = \\{3^0, 3^3\\} = \\{1, 6\\}$.\n\nThe field $K$ is defined via the standard isomorphism in cyclotomic theory, $\\psi: \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, given by $\\psi(\\sigma_a) = a$, where $\\sigma_a(\\zeta_7) = \\zeta_7^a$. The problem states that $K$ is the fixed field of the subgroup corresponding to $\\ker(\\chi)$. Let $H = \\psi^{-1}(\\ker(\\chi))$ be the corresponding subgroup of $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$. Then $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)^H$.

By definition, the conductor $f_K$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that $K$ is contained within the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$. This immediately implies that once we find $f_K$, the minimal cyclotomic field containing $K$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{f_K})$. Thus, the two parts of the question are answered by finding a single value, $f_K$.\n\nFrom class field theory, the conductor of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is equal to the conductor of its associated character group, $X_K = (\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}))^{\\wedge}$. The characters in $X_K$ can be viewed as Dirichlet characters via the Artin map. The character group $X_K$ is generated by a character which, when inflated to $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$, is precisely $\\chi$. Thus, the character group for the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ consists of the powers of $\\chi$: $X_K = \\langle \\chi \\rangle = \\{\\chi^0, \\chi, \\chi^2\\}$.\n\nThe conductor of a group of Dirichlet characters is the least common multiple (lcm) of the conductors of the individual characters in the group. So, $f_K = \\operatorname{lcm}(f(\\chi^0), f(\\chi), f(\\chi^2))$.\n\nWe must now determine the conductor of each character.\n$1$. The character $\\chi^0$ is the principal character. When viewed as a character modulo $7$, it is induced by the trivial character modulo $1$. The conductor of the trivial character is $1$. Thus, $f(\\chi^0) = 1$.\n$2$. The conductor of a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is the smallest positive integer $d$ dividing $N$ such that $\\chi$ can be defined as a character modulo $d$. A character is called primitive if its modulus cannot be lowered, i.e., if its conductor is equal to its modulus.\nIn our case, $\\chi$ is a character modulo $7$. The modulus $N=7$ is a prime number. The only proper divisor of $7$ is $d=1$. A character modulo $1$ is necessarily the trivial character (it has only one value, $\\chi(1)=1$). Our character $\\chi$ is not trivial, since, for example, $\\chi(3) = \\exp(2\\pi i/3) \\neq 1$. Therefore, $\\chi$ cannot be induced from a character modulo $1$. This forces $\\chi$ to be a primitive character modulo $7$. The conductor of a primitive character is its modulus, so $f(\\chi) = 7$.\n$3$. The character $\\chi^2$ is the complex conjugate of $\\chi$, since $\\chi^2(3) = \\exp(4\\pi i/3) = \\overline{\\exp(2\\pi i/3)} = \\overline{\\chi(3)}$. A Dirichlet character is primitive if and only if its complex conjugate is primitive. Thus, $\\chi^2$ is also a primitive character modulo $7$, and its conductor is also $f(\\chi^2) = 7$.\n\nCombining these results, the conductor of the extension $K$ is:\n$$ f_K = \\operatorname{lcm}(f(\\chi^0), f(\\chi), f(\\chi^2)) = \\operatorname{lcm}(1, 7, 7) = 7 $$\nThe conductor of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $f_K = 7$.\n\nBy the definition of the conductor of an abelian extension, the minimal cyclotomic field containing $K$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ where $m = f_K$.\nTherefore, the minimal cyclotomic field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the conductor $f_K=7$ and the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 7  \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{7}) \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "3027403"}, {"introduction": "The true power of the Kronecker-Weber theorem lies not just in identifying containing fields, but in using that knowledge to solve concrete arithmetic problems.

Second, we compute the natural density of such primes.\n\n**Part 1: Conditions for Complete Splitting**\n\nA rational prime $p$ splits completely in the biquadratic extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{13})$ if and only if it splits completely in both of the quadratic subfields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$. The problem specifies that we consider primes $p$ such that $p \\nmid 65$, which means $p \\neq 5$ and $p \\neq 13$. This ensures that $p$ is unramified in both subfields.\n\nFor a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d$ being a square-free integer, a prime $p$ that does not divide $2d$ splits completely if and only if $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This condition is expressed using the Legendre symbol as $(\\frac{d}{p}) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, for a prime $p$ to split completely in $K$, we must satisfy the following two conditions simultaneously:\n1.  $p$ splits in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, which means $(\\frac{5}{p}) = 1$.\n2.  $p$ splits in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{13})$, which means $(\\frac{13}{p}) = 1$.\n\nWe now translate these Legendre symbol conditions into congruence conditions on $p$ using the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. For distinct odd primes $p$ and $q$, this law states that $(\\frac{p}{q})(\\frac{q}{p}) = (-1)^{\\frac{(p-1)}{2}\\frac{(q-1)}{2}}$.\n\nFor the first condition, involving $q=5$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{5}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{(5-1)}{2}\\frac{(p-1)}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) (-1)^{2\\left(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{p}{5}\\right) $$\nThus, the condition $(\\frac{5}{p}) = 1$ is equivalent to $(\\frac{p}{5}) = 1$.
