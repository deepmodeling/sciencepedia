The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}_{13}$ is a local field with ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}_{13}$, maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_K = 13\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$, and residue field $k_K = \\mathcal{O}_K/\\mathfrak{p}_K \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{13}$. The extension is $L = K(\\sqrt{5})$. The discriminant of the polynomial $x^2 - 5$ is $4 \\cdot 5 = 20$. The element $5$ is a $13$-adic unit, as its valuation is $v_{13}(5) = 0$. An extension $K(\\sqrt{d})$ of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ with $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$ is unramified if and only if $d$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$. For our case, $p=13$ and $d=5$. We check if $5$ is a quadratic residue modulo $13$ using the Legendre symbol.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) \\quad (\\text{by Quadratic Reciprocity})\n$$\nSince $13 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, we have\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{13}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = -1\n$$\nBecause the quadratic residues modulo $5$ are $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 4$. As $\\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right) = -1$, $5$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$. By Hensel's lemma, this implies $5$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_{13}$. Thus, the extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension of degree $[L:K]=2$. Since $v_{13}(5)=0$, the extension is unramified. The Galois group is $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and its non-trivial element is $\\tau$, defined by $\\tau(\\sqrt{5}) = -\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nAccording to local class field theory, for an unramified extension $L/K$, the local reciprocity map $\\theta_K: K^{\\times} \\to \\mathrm{Gal}(K^{\\mathrm{ab}}/K)$ has a specific structure when restricted to $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. The kernel of the projection map $K^{\\times} \\to \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ is the norm group $N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$. For an unramified extension, the group of units $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is a subgroup of the norm group, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times} \\subset N_{L/K}(L^{\\times})$. This means that for any unit $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$, its image $\\theta_K(u)|_L$ is the identity in $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$.\n\nAny element $x \\in K^{\\times}$ can be uniquely written as $x = \\pi_K^{v_K(x)} u$, where $\\pi_K$ is a uniformizer for $K$ (e.g., $\\pi_K = 13$), $v_K$ is the valuation on $K$, and $u \\in \\mathcal{O}_K^{\\times}$ is a unit. Since $\\theta_K$ is a homomorphism, we have:\n$$\n\\theta_K(x)|_L = \\theta_K(\\pi_K^{v_K(x)} u)|_L = \\theta_K(\\pi_K)^{v_K(x)}|_L \\cdot \\theta_K(u)|_L\n$$\nAs $\\theta_K(u)|_L$ is the identity, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\theta_K(x)|_L = (\\theta_K(\\pi_K)|_L)^{v_K(x)}\n$$\nA fundamental result of local class field theory states that for an unramified extension, the image of a uniformizer under the reciprocity map is the Frobenius automorphism, $\\mathrm{Frob}_{L/K}$.\n$$\n\\theta_K(\\pi_K)|_L = \\mathrm{Frob}_{L/K}\n$$\nThus, for any $x \\in K^{\\times}$, we have the relation $\\theta_K(x)|_L = (\\mathrm{Frob}_{L/K})^{v_K(x)}$.\n\nNext, we must identify the Frobenius automorphism $\\mathrm{Frob}_{L/K}$ within the group $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K) = \\{\\mathrm{id}, \\tau\\}$. The Frobenius automorphism is the element of $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ that induces the Frobenius map $z \\mapsto z^{|k_K|} = z^{13}$ on the residue field extension $k_L/k_K$. Here $k_L = \\mathcal{O}_L/\\mathfrak{p}_L \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{13^2} \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{13}(\\bar{\\sqrt{5}})$, where $\\bar{\\sqrt{5}}$ is a root of $x^2 - 5 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{13^2}$. The action of the Frobenius map on $\\bar{\\sqrt{5}}$ is:\n$$\n(\\bar{\\sqrt{5}})^{13} = \\bar{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot (\\bar{5})^{(13-1)/2} = \\bar{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\bar{5}^6\n$$\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$, we calculate $5^6$:\n$$\n5^2 = 25 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\n$$\n$$\n5^6 = (5^2)^3 \\equiv (-1)^3 = -1 \\pmod{13}\n$$\nTherefore, the action of the Frobenius on $\\bar{\\sqrt{5}}$ is $(\\bar{\\sqrt{5}})^{13} = -\\bar{\\sqrt{5}}$. This is the action induced by the automorphism $\\tau$, since $\\tau(\\sqrt{5}) = -\\sqrt{5}$ and its reduction modulo the maximal ideal of $L$ is exactly this map. For any unramified extension of degree greater than $1$, the Frobenius automorphism is non-trivial. Thus, $\\mathrm{Frob}_{L/K} = \\tau$.\n\nNow we can apply this to the specific element $a = 13^3 \\cdot 2$. We need to compute its valuation $v_{13}(a)$. The valuation is normalized by $v_{13}(13)=1$.\n$$\nv_{13}(a) = v_{13}(13^3 \\cdot 2) = v_{13}(13^3) + v_{13}(2)\n$$\nUsing the properties of valuations, $v_{13}(13^3) = 3 \\cdot v_{13}(13) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$. Since $2$ is not divisible by $13$, it is a $13$-adic unit, meaning $v_{13}(2) = 0$.\nSo, the valuation is $v_{13}(a) = 3 + 0 = 3$.\n\nSubstituting this into our main formula:\n$$\n\\theta_K(a)|_L = (\\mathrm{Frob}_{L/K})^{v_{13}(a)} = \\tau^3\n$$\nThe Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ has order $2$, so $\\tau$ is an element of order $2$. This means $\\tau^2 = \\mathrm{id}$, where $\\mathrm{id}$ is the identity automorphism.

The group $G$ fits into a sequence of normal subgroups\n$$\n\\{1\\} \\subseteq G_{1} \\subseteq G_{0} \\subseteq G\n$$\nwhere $G_{0}$ is the inertia subgroup and $G_{1}$ is the first (or wild) ramification subgroup.\nThe orders of the quotients are given by standard ramification theory:\n1.  $|G/G_{0}| = f$, the residue degree. The quotient group $G/G_{0}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathrm{Gal}(k_L/k_K)$, where $k_L$ and $k_K$ are the residue fields of $L$ and $K$ respectively.\n2.  $|G_{0}| = e$, the ramification index.

Consequently, the order of $G_{1}$ is a power of $p$.\n4.  The quotient group $G_{0}/G_{1}$ is the tame inertia quotient. It is a cyclic group, and its order is $|G_{0}|/|G_{1}| = e/|G_{1}|$.\n\nThe problem provides the crucial condition that the extension $L/K$ is tamely ramified. By definition, this means that the ramification index $e$ is not divisible by the residue characteristic $p$, i.e., $p \\nmid e$.\nSince $G_{1}$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G_{0}$ (its order is a power of $p$), and the order of $G_{0}$ is $e$, Lagrange's theorem implies that the order of $G_{1}$ must divide $e$. The only power of $p$ that can divide a number not divisible by $p$ is $p^0=1$. Therefore, the wild inertia subgroup $G_{1}$ must be the trivial group.\n$$\nG_{1} = \\{1\\}\n$$\nThis is a fundamental result in ramification theory: an extension is tamely ramified if and only if its wild inertia subgroup is trivial.\n\nNext, we employ the results of Local Class Field Theory (LCFT). The local reciprocity map $\\theta_{L/K}: K^{\\times} \\to G$ connects the multiplicative group of the base field $K$ to the Galois group of the extension. One of the main theorems of LCFT establishes a correspondence between the filtration of the unit group of $K$ and the ramification filtration of $G$.\n\nThe group of units of $K$, $\\mathcal{O}_{K}^{\\times}$, is denoted by $U_K^0$.

The problem specifically concerns the first higher unit group, $U_K^1 = 1 + \\mathfrak{m}_{K}$.\n\nA cornerstone result of LCFT states that the reciprocity map respects these filtrations. Specifically, for an abelian extension $L/K$, the image of the group of principal units $U_K^1$ under the reciprocity map is precisely the first ramification group (wild inertia subgroup) $G_1$.\n$$\n\\theta_{L/K}(U_K^1) = G_{1}\n$$\nMore generally, the theory states that $\\theta_{L/K}(U_K^i) = G^i$, where $\\{G^{v}\\}_{v \\geq -1}$ is the ramification filtration in the upper numbering.

For a fixed uniformizer $\\pi_K$ (an element with $v_K(\\pi_K)=1$), this ideal is principal, $\\mathfrak{m}_K = (\\pi_K)$. The powers of the maximal ideal are $\\mathfrak{m}_K^n = \\{x \\in K \\mid v_K(x) \\geq n\\} = (\\pi_K^n)$ for any integer $n \\geq 1$.\n\nThe group of units of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_K^\\times = \\{x \\in K \\mid v_K(x) = 0\\}$.

If $n_1 > n_2$, then $n_1 \\geq n_2+1$. This implies that any element with valuation at least $n_1$ also has valuation at least $n_2$, so $\\mathfrak{m}_K^{n_1} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{m}_K^{n_2}$.

We seek the smallest integer $m(n)$ such that $N_{L/K}(U_L^n) \\subseteq U_K^{m(n)}$.\n\nLet $x \\in U_L^n$, so $x = 1+y$ for some $y \\in \\mathfrak{m}_L^n$, which means $v_L(y) \\geq n$. The norm of $x$ is given by\n$$\nN_{L/K}(x) = N_{L/K}(1+y) = \\prod_{\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)} \\sigma(1+y) = \\prod_{\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)} (1+\\sigma(y)).\n$$\nExpanding the product gives\n$$\nN_{L/K}(1+y) = 1 + \\sum_{\\sigma} \\sigma(y) + \\sum_{\\sigma \\neq \\tau} \\sigma(y)\\tau(y) + \\dots + \\prod_{\\sigma} \\sigma(y).\n$$\nThe first summation term is the trace, $\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(y)$. Let $z$ be the sum of all terms of degree $2$ or higher in the $\\sigma(y)$'s. Then\n$$\nN_{L/K}(1+y) = 1 + \\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(y) + z.\n$$\nWe need to find a lower bound for $v_K(N_{L/K}(1+y)-1) = v_K(\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(y) + z)$.\nFor any $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, $v_L(\\sigma(y)) = v_L(y) \\geq n$.\nThe terms in $z$ are products of at least two such elements. For example, a term $\\sigma(y)\\tau(y)$ has valuation $v_L(\\sigma(y)\\tau(y)) = v_L(\\sigma(y)) + v_L(\\tau(y)) \\geq n+n=2n$. Thus, $v_L(z) \\geq 2n$.\nUsing the relation $v_K(u) = \\frac{1}{e}v_L(u)$, we have $v_K(z) \\geq \\frac{2n}{e}$.\n\nNow we analyze the trace term. The trace map $\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}$ sends $\\mathfrak{m}_L^n$ to some ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. A standard result for a tame extension is that the trace map $\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}: \\mathfrak{m}_L^n \\to \\mathfrak{m}_K^{\\lceil n/e \\rceil}$ is surjective. This can be shown by considering the composition of the unramified and totally ramified parts of the extension. For the unramified part, $\\mathrm{Tr}$ is surjective on the rings of integers, and for the tamely and totally ramified part (where $L=K(\\pi_L)$ with $\\pi_L^e = \\pi_K u$), one computes the trace of powers of $\\pi_L$ to show that $\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(\\mathfrak{m}_L^k)$ is exactly $\\mathfrak{m}_K^{\\lceil k/e\\rceil}$.\nThis means that for any $y \\in \\mathfrak{m}_L^n$, $v_K(\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(y)) \\geq \\lceil n/e \\rceil$, and there exists some $y_0 \\in \\mathfrak{m}_L^n$ for which $v_K(\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(y_0)) = \\lceil n/e \\rceil$.\n\nThe valuation of the norm is thus\n$$\nv_K(N_{L/K}(1+y)-1) \\geq \\min(v_K(\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}(y)), v_K(z)) \\geq \\min(\\lceil n/e \\rceil, \\lceil 2n/e \\rceil).\n$$\nSince $n \\geq 1$ and $e \\geq 1$, we have $2n/e \\ge n/e$, so $\\lceil 2n/e \\rceil \\geq \\lceil n/e \\rceil$. Thus, the minimum is $\\lceil n/e \\rceil$.\nThis proves the inclusion $N_{L/K}(U_L^n) \\subseteq U_K^{\\lceil n/e \\rceil}$, so $m(n) \\geq \\lceil n/e \\rceil$. To show that $m(n) = \\lceil n/e \\rceil$ is the smallest such integer, we must show that the image is not contained in any smaller group $U_K^{\\lceil n/e \\rceil+1}$. This is equivalent to proving that the map $N_{L/K}:U_L^n \\to U_K^{\\lceil n/e \\rceil}$ is surjective.\n\nFor large enough $n$ (specifically, for $n > v_L(p)/(p-1)$), the logarithm map is an isomorphism from $U_L^n$ to $\\mathfrak{m}_L^n$ and from $U_K^m$ to $\\mathfrak{m}_K^m$. The diagram\n$$\n\\begin{CD}\nU_L^n @>N_{L/K}>> U_K^m \\\\\n@V\\log VV @VV\\log V \\\\\n\\mathfrak{m}_L^n @>>\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}> \\mathfrak{m}_K^m\n\\end{CD}\n$$\ncommutes. Since $\\mathrm{Tr}_{L/K}: \\mathfrak{m}_L^n \\to \\mathfrak{m}_K^{\\lceil n/e \\rceil}$ is surjective in the tame case, and $\\log$ is an isomorphism, the norm map is also surjective for large $n$. A more detailed analysis using an iterative argument (akin to Hensel's Lemma) on the equation $N_{L/K}(1+y)=1+z$ for $z \\in \\mathfrak{m}_K^{\\lceil n/e \\rceil}$ proves surjectivity for all $n \\geq 1$.\nTherefore, for a tame extension, the smallest integer is $m(n) = \\lceil n/e \\rceil$.\n\n### Part 3: The General (Wildly Ramified) Case\n\nIn the general case of a finite Galois extension, which may be wildly ramified ($p \\mid e$), the relationship between the filtrations is governed by the Hasse-Herbrand function $\\phi_{L/K}(u)$. This function is defined for $u \\ge 0$ as\n$$\n\\phi_{L/K}(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{dt}{[G_0:G_t]},\n$$\nwhere $G_t$ denotes the $t$-th ramification group of $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$ in the lower numbering. The function $\\phi_{L/K}$ is continuous, piecewise linear, and strictly increasing.\n\nA fundamental result of local class field theory, particularly for abelian extensions, is that the norm map transforms the filtration of higher unit groups of $L$ to that of $K$ via the function $\\phi_{L/K}$. More concretely, for an abelian extension $L/K$, the image of $U_L^n$ under the norm map is precisely $U_K^{\\phi_{L/K}(n)}$ when unit groups are defined for real indices (i.e., $U_F^x = \\{u \\mid v_F(u-1) \\ge x\\}$). This means that for any $y \\in U_L^n$, we have $v_K(N_{L/K}(y)-1) \\geq \\phi_{L/K}(n)$, and there exists some $y_0 \\in U_L^n$ for which the equality $v_K(N_{L/K}(y_0)-1) = \\phi_{L/K}(n)$ holds.\n\nFor a general Galois extension, the inclusion $N_{L/K}(U_L^n) \\subseteq U_K^{\\phi_{L/K}(n)}$ (with real indices) still holds, although equality of the sets does not (the image is contained in the group corresponding to the abelianization of the extension).\nGiven an element $x \\in U_L^n$, we know $v_L(x-1) \\geq n$. From the property above, we have $v_K(N_{L/K}(x)-1) \\geq \\phi_{L/K}(n)$.\nSince the filtration $\\{U_K^m\\}$ in the problem is defined for integer indices $m \\geq 1$, the condition $v_K(N_{L/K}(x)-1) \\geq \\phi_{L/K}(n)$ means that $N_{L/K}(x)-1$ belongs to the ideal $\\mathfrak{m}_K^m$ where $m$ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\phi_{L/K}(n)$. That is, $m = \\lceil \\phi_{L/K}(n) \\rceil$.\nThus, for any $x \\in U_L^n$, $N_{L/K}(x) \\in U_K^{\\lceil \\phi_{L/K}(n) \\rceil}$.\nThe smallest integer $m(n)$ is therefore given by $m(n) = \\lceil \\phi_{L/K}(n) \\rceil$.\n\nWe can verify this general formula against the special cases:\n1.  **Unramified case**: $e=1$. The inertia group $G_0=\\{1\\}$. Thus $[G_0:G_t]=1$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n    $\\phi_{L/K}(u) = \\int_0^u 1\\,dt = u$.\n    The formula gives $m(n) = \\lceil n \\rceil = n$. This is the correct result for unramified extensions, $N_{L/K}(U_L^n) = U_K^n$.\n2.  **Tame case**: $p \\nmid e$. The higher ramification groups $G_t$ are trivial for $t>0$. So $G_t=\\{1\\}$ for $t>0$. The inertia group $G_0$ has order $e$. Thus $[G_0:G_t] = e$ for $t>0$.\n    $\\phi_{L/K}(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{e}\\,dt = \\frac{u}{e}$.\n    The formula gives $m(n) = \\lceil n/e \\rceil$, which matches the result derived in Part 2.\n\nThus, the smallest integer $m(n)$ in the general case is expressed in terms of the Hasse-Herbrand function as $m(n) = \\lceil \\phi_{L/K}(n) \\rceil$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\lceil\\frac{n}{e}\\rceil & \\lceil \\phi_{L/K}(n) \\rceil \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3017201"}]}
