By relating the number-theoretic Kronecker symbol to the algebraic factorization of a polynomial, you will solidify your understanding of the Artin symbol as a precise predictor of prime splitting.", "problem": "Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic number field, where $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is square-free and $d \\neq 0,1$. Denote by $\\Delta_L$ the field discriminant of $L$, determined by the rule: if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ then $\\Delta_L = d$, and otherwise $\\Delta_L = 4d$. Let $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and for each rational prime $p$, consider the Artin symbol $\\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{p}\\right)$ at $p$ whenever $p$ is unramified in $L$ (that is, $p \\nmid \\Delta_L$). The Artin symbol is the conjugacy class of the Frobenius automorphism in $G$, which in this case is either the identity or the unique nontrivial element because $G$ is abelian of order $2$.\n\nImplement a program that, for a given list of $(d,p)$ pairs, computes the Artin symbol by two conceptually distinct methods and verifies their agreement:\n\n- Method A (Kronecker symbol): Using only the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right)$, classify the Frobenius element at $p$ as follows: if $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = 0$ then $p$ is ramified and the Artin symbol is not defined; if $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = 1$ then $p$ splits and the Artin symbol is the identity; if $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = -1$ then $p$ is inert and the Artin symbol is the nontrivial automorphism. Encode the three outcomes respectively as $-1$ for ramified, $0$ for the identity, and $1$ for the nontrivial element.\n\n- Method B (factoring minimal polynomials modulo $p$): Let $\\theta$ be an algebraic integer generating $\\mathcal{O}_L$ and let $f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be its monic minimal polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For quadratic fields, take\n  - if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $\\theta = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ and $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$,\n  - otherwise, $\\theta = \\sqrt{d}$ and $f(x) = x^2 - d$.\n  Reduce $f(x)$ modulo $p$ and use its factorization over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ to classify the splitting type of $p$ in $L$ and hence the Frobenius element: if $f$ has two distinct linear factors modulo $p$, then $p$ splits (encode as $0$); if $f$ is irreducible modulo $p$, then $p$ is inert (encode as $1$); if $f$ has a repeated root modulo $p$, then $p$ is ramified (encode as $-1$).\n\nJustify in your solution why the two methods agree at all rational primes $p$.\n\nYour program must produce a single line of output containing, for each test case, a boolean indicating whether the classification by Method A and Method B agree. The final line must be a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, $[\\text{True},\\text{False},\\text{True}]$.\n\nUse the following test suite of $(d,p)$ pairs, chosen to probe general behavior, the prime $p=2$, and ramification:\n\n- $d = 5$, $p = 2$,\n- $d = 5$, $p = 3$,\n- $d = 5$, $p = 5$,\n- $d = 2$, $p = 3$,\n- $d = 2$, $p = 17$,\n- $d = 13$, $p = 3$,\n- $d = 13$, $p = 2$,\n- $d = -3$, $p = 2$,\n- $d = -3$, $p = 3$,\n- $d = -3$, $p = 7$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[\\text{True},\\text{True},\\dots]$). No physical units, angle units, or percentages are involved in this problem. The correctness criterion for each test case is the boolean equality of the two classification methods.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of algebraic number theory, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and definitions, with no internal contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a justification of the equivalence of two methods for determining the behavior of a prime $p$ in a quadratic number field $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, and for a computational verification of this equivalence. The behavior of a prime $p$ can be categorized as splitting, remaining inert, or ramifying. These behaviors correspond to how the ideal $(p)$ generated by $p$ in the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_L$ of the field $L$.\n\nThe Artin symbol, $\\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{p}\\right)$, is an element of the Galois group $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ that elegantly captures this behavior for unramified primes. For a quadratic field, $G$ has two elements: the identity and a nontrivial automorphism $\\sigma: \\sqrt{d} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{d}$.\n- If $p$ splits, the Artin symbol is the identity element.\n- If $p$ is inert, the Artin symbol is the nontrivial element $\\sigma$.\n- If $p$ ramifies, the Artin symbol is not defined.\n\nThe problem defines a numerical encoding for these three cases: $0$ for split (identity), $1$ for inert (nontrivial), and $-1$ for ramified.\n\nMethod A classifies primes using the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right)$, where $\\Delta_L$ is the discriminant of the field $L$. A fundamental theorem of quadratic fields states that for an unramified prime $p$ (i.e., $p \\nmid \\Delta_L$):\n- $p$ splits in $L$ if and only if $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = 1$.\n- $p$ is inert in $L$ if and only if $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = -1$.\nA prime $p$ ramifies in $L$ if and only if $p$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta_L$, which corresponds to $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = 0$. Method A directly applies this theorem using the problem's encoding scheme.\n\nMethod B uses the factorization of the minimal polynomial $f(x)$ of a generator $\\theta$ of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_L$. This method is based on a powerful result known as Dedekind's Factorization Theorem. The theorem states that if $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ for some algebraic integer $\\theta$ with minimal polynomial $f(x)$, then the factorization of the ideal $(p)$ in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ mirrors the factorization of the polynomial $f(x)$ reduced modulo $p$ in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n- If $f(x) \\pmod p$ factors into two distinct linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, then $(p)$ splits into two distinct prime ideals in $\\mathcal{O}_L$.\n- If $f(x) \\pmod p$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, then $(p)$ remains a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ (i.e., $p$ is inert).\n- If $f(x) \\pmod p$ has a repeated factor in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$, then $(p)$ is the square of a prime ideal in $\\mathcal{O}_L$ (i.e., $p$ ramifies).\n\nThe problem formulation carefully chooses $\\theta$ in each case such that the condition $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is always satisfied, ensuring the applicability of this theorem for all primes $p$.\n\nThe justification for the equivalence of Method A and Method B rests on demonstrating that the factorization of $f(x) \\pmod p$ is governed by the value of $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right)$. A key insight is that for the specific choice of $\\theta$ and its minimal polynomial $f(x)$ given in the problem, the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ is precisely the field discriminant $\\Delta_L$.\nLet's verify this:\n1.  If $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod 4$, we have $\\theta = \\sqrt{d}$ and $f(x) = x^2 - d$. The discriminant of this polynomial is $\\operatorname{Disc}(f) = 0^2 - 4(1)(-d) = 4d$. In this case, the field discriminant is $\\Delta_L = 4d$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Disc}(f) = \\Delta_L$.\n2.  If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $\\theta = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ and $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$. The discriminant is $\\operatorname{Disc}(f) = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(\\frac{1-d}{4}) = 1 - (1-d) = d$. In this case, the field discriminant is $\\Delta_L = d$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Disc}(f) = \\Delta_L$.\n\nNow we analyze the factorization of $f(x) \\pmod p$.\n\nFor an odd prime $p$ ($p \\neq 2$):\nThe factorization of a quadratic polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is determined by its discriminant. A quadratic polynomial has two distinct roots, no roots, or a repeated root in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if and only if its discriminant is a quadratic residue, a quadratic non-residue, or zero modulo $p$, respectively. This can be expressed using the Legendre symbol.\nSince $\\operatorname{Disc}(f) = \\Delta_L$, the factorization of $f(x) \\pmod p$ is determined by $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right)$.\n- $f(x)$ splits into two distinct factors $\\iff \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = 1$. This corresponds to code $0$.\n- $f(x)$ is irreducible $\\iff \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = -1$. This corresponds to code $1$.\n- $f(x)$ has a repeated root $\\iff \\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{p}\\right) = 0$. This corresponds to code $-1$.\nThis matches the rules for Method A perfectly.\n\nFor the prime $p=2$:\nThe quadratic formula is not applicable, so we check the cases directly.\n\nCase I: $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod 4$.\n- Method A: $\\Delta_L = 4d$. Since $2 | \\Delta_L$, the Kronecker symbol $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta_L}{2}\\right) = 0$. This implies ramification (code $-1$).\n- Method B: $f(x) = x^2 - d$. We reduce modulo $2$.\n    - If $d \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, $d$ is even, so $f(x) \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$. This has a repeated root $x=0$. This implies ramification (code $-1$).\n    - If $d \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $d$ is odd, so $f(x) \\equiv x^2 - 1 \\equiv x^2 + 1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$. This has a repeated root $x=1$. This implies ramification (code $-1$).\nIn both subcases, the methods agree.\n\nCase II: $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n- Method A: $\\Delta_L = d$. The outcome depends on $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)$. By definition of the Kronecker symbol:\n    - If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right) = 1$. This implies splitting (code $0$).\n    - If $d \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$, $\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right) = -1$. This implies inert (code $1$).\n- Method B: $f(x) = x^2 - x + \\frac{1-d}{4}$. We reduce modulo $2$, which gives $f(x) \\equiv x^2+x+\\frac{1-d}{4} \\pmod 2$.\n    - If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, we can write $d = 8k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $\\frac{1-d}{4} = \\frac{-8k}{4} = -2k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. So, $f(x) \\equiv x^2+x = x(x+1) \\pmod 2$. This has two distinct roots, $0$ and $1$. It splits (code $0$).\n    - If $d \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$, we can write $d = 8k+5$. Then $\\frac{1-d}{4} = \\frac{-8k-4}{4} = -2k-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So, $f(x) \\equiv x^2+x+1 \\pmod 2$. This polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2$ ($f(0)=1, f(1)=1$), so it is irreducible. It is inert (code $1$).\nAgain, the results from both methods match perfectly.\n\nSince Method A and Method B produce identical classifications for all primes $p$ and all valid choices of $d$, their equivalence is established. The connection is the deep result that the discriminant of the minimal polynomial for a generator of the ring of integers is the field discriminant.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by implementing and comparing the two methods for\n    classifying prime splitting in quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        (5, 2),\n        (5, 3),\n        (5, 5),\n        (2, 3),\n        (2, 17),\n        (13, 3),\n        (13, 2),\n        (-3, 2),\n        (-3, 3),\n        (-3, 7),\n    ]\n\n    def kronecker_prime(a, p):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the Kronecker symbol (a/p) for an integer a and a prime p.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not isinstance(p, int) or p <= 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"p must be a prime number.\")\n\n        if p == 2:\n            if a % 2 == 0:\n                return 0\n            a_mod_8 = a % 8\n            if a_mod_8 == 1 or a_mod_8 == 7:\n                return 1\n            else:  # a_mod_8 == 3 or a_mod_8 == 5\n                return -1\n        \n        # p is an odd prime\n        if a % p == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Euler's criterion for the Legendre symbol\n        res = pow(a, (p - 1) // 2, p)\n        if res == p - 1:\n            return -1\n        return 1\n\n    def method_a(d, p):\n        \"\"\"\n        Classifies prime behavior using the Kronecker symbol of the field discriminant.\n        Encoding: -1 for ramified, 0 for split, 1 for inert.\n        \"\"\"\n        if d % 4 == 1:\n            delta_L = d\n        else:\n            delta_L = 4 * d\n        \n        k = kronecker_prime(delta_L, p)\n        \n        if k == 1:\n            return 0  # Splits\n        elif k == -1:\n            return 1  # Inert\n        else:  # k == 0\n            return -1 # Ramified\n\n    def method_b(d, p):\n        \"\"\"\n        Classifies prime behavior by factoring the minimal polynomial mod p.\n        Encoding: -1 for ramified, 0 for split, 1 for inert.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Case 1: d = 1 (mod 4)\n        if d % 4 == 1:\n            # f(x) = x^2 - x + (1-d)/4\n            if p == 2:\n                # The factorization of x^2+x+c (mod 2) depends on c.\n                # c = (1-d)/4.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first characterizing the Galois group, then deriving the action of the Frobenius automorphism for a prime ideal, extending this to the Artin symbol for a general ideal $(a)$, and finally addressing the specific questions posed.\n\n**1. Structure of the Galois Group**\nThe extension $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a finite Galois extension. The ring of integers of $L$ is $\\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_m]$. An automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is completely determined by its action on the generator $\\zeta_m$. Since $\\sigma$ must map roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\zeta_m$ (the $m$-th cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_m(x)$) to other roots, $\\sigma(\\zeta_m)$ must be another primitive $m$-th root of unity. The primitive $m$-th roots of unity are of the form $\\zeta_m^k$ for integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k < m$ and $\\gcd(k, m) = 1$.\nThis establishes a canonical isomorphism of groups:\n$$ \\Psi: (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times} \\to \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) $$\ndefined by mapping the residue class $[k]_m$ to the automorphism $\\sigma_k$ such that $\\sigma_k(\\zeta_m) = \\zeta_m^k$. The group $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is therefore abelian, of order $\\phi(m)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\n**2. The Frobenius Automorphism and the Artin Symbol**\nLet $p$ be a prime number such that $p \\nmid m$. The problem states that the ideal $(p) = p\\mathbb{Z}$ is unramified in $L$. Let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be any prime ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_L$ lying above $(p)$. The Frobenius automorphism at $\\mathfrak{p}$, denoted $\\operatorname{Frob}_{\\mathfrak{p}}$, is the unique element of $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ satisfying the condition:\n$$ \\operatorname{Frob}_{\\mathfrak{p}}(x) \\equiv x^p \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathcal{O}_L. $$\nSince the extension is abelian, the Frobenius automorphism depends only on the prime ideal $(p)$ in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$, not on the choice of $\\mathfrak{p}$ above it. We denote it by $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$. The Artin symbol for the prime ideal $(p)$ is defined as this element:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(p)}\\right) = \\operatorname{Frob}_p. $$\nTo find the explicit action of $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$, we seek the automorphism $\\sigma_k \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ that satisfies the defining congruence. Let's test the condition on the generator $\\zeta_m$. We must have $\\sigma_k(\\zeta_m) \\equiv \\zeta_m^p \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}}$. By definition of $\\sigma_k$, this is $\\zeta_m^k \\equiv \\zeta_m^p \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}}$.\nNow consider the specific automorphism $\\sigma_p$, where $p$ is the prime number. Since $\\gcd(p,m)=1$, $[p]_m \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, so $\\sigma_p$ is a valid element of $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. For any element $x = \\sum_{j} c_j \\zeta_m^j \\in \\mathcal{O}_L = \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_m]$, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_p(x) = \\sum_{j} c_j (\\sigma_p(\\zeta_m))^j = \\sum_{j} c_j (\\zeta_m^p)^j = \\sum_{j} c_j \\zeta_m^{jp}. $$\nOn the other hand, using the property $(u+v)^p \\equiv u^p + v^p \\pmod p$ in rings of characteristic $p$, and Fermat's Little Theorem ($c_j^p \\equiv c_j \\pmod p$ for $c_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), we have:\n$$ x^p = \\left(\\sum_{j} c_j \\zeta_m^j\\right)^p \\equiv \\sum_{j} c_j^p (\\zeta_m^j)^p \\equiv \\sum_{j} c_j \\zeta_m^{jp} \\pmod{p\\mathcal{O}_L}. $$\nSince $\\mathfrak{p}$ lies above $(p)$, the ideal $p\\mathcal{O}_L$ is contained in $\\mathfrak{p}$, so any congruence modulo $p\\mathcal{O}_L$ is also a congruence modulo $\\mathfrak{p}$. Thus,\n$$ x^p \\equiv \\sigma_p(x) \\pmod{\\mathfrak{p}}. $$\nThis shows that $\\sigma_p$ satisfies the defining property of the Frobenius automorphism. By uniqueness, $\\operatorname{Frob}_p = \\sigma_p$.\nTherefore, the Artin symbol for a prime ideal $(p)$ is $\\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(p)}\\right) = \\sigma_p$.\n\n**3. Action of the General Artin Symbol**\nThe problem concerns the Artin symbol for an integral ideal $(a)$, where $a$ is a positive integer with $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$. Let the prime factorization of $a$ be $a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_r^{e_r}$. Since $\\gcd(a,m)=1$, each prime factor $p_i$ is also coprime to $m$, so each ideal $(p_i)$ is unramified. The Artin symbol is extended multiplicatively from prime ideals to general ideals:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(a)}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(p_i)}\\right)^{e_i}. $$\nSubstituting the result from the previous section:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(a)}\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (\\sigma_{p_i})^{e_i}. $$\nThe group operation in $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is function composition. The composition of automorphisms $\\sigma_k$ and $\\sigma_j$ is $\\sigma_k \\circ \\sigma_j = \\sigma_{kj}$. Therefore, the product of automorphisms corresponds to the product of their indices:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(a)}\\right) = \\sigma_{p_1^{e_1}} \\circ \\sigma_{p_2^{e_2}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\sigma_{p_r^{e_r}} = \\sigma_{p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_r^{e_r}} = \\sigma_a. $$\nThe explicit action of this automorphism on the generator $\\zeta_m$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(a)}\\right)(\\zeta_m) = \\sigma_a(\\zeta_m) = \\zeta_m^a. $$\nThe corresponding residue class in $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ is found via the inverse of the canonical isomorphism $\\Psi$. Since $\\Psi([a]_m) = \\sigma_a$, the automorphism $\\sigma_a$ corresponds to the residue class $[a]_m$.\n\n**4. Specialization to $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$**\nIf we specialize to the case where $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$, the residue class corresponding to the symbol is $[a]_m = [1]_m$. This is the identity element of the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. Under the isomorphism $\\Psi$, this corresponds to the identity automorphism $\\sigma_1$ in $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The action of $\\sigma_1$ is $\\sigma_1(\\zeta_m) = \\zeta_m^1 = \\zeta_m$, which fixes $\\zeta_m$ and hence all of $L$. Thus, for $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$, the Artin symbol $\\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(a)}\\right)$ is the trivial (identity) element of the Galois group.\n\n**5. Reflection on Surjectivity**\nThe problem's phrasing \"surjectivity of the Artin map from the group of residue classes\" is non-standard. The Artin map, $\\operatorname{Art}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}$, is a homomorphism from the group of fractional ideals of $\\mathbb{Q}$ coprime to $m$, denoted $I_{\\mathbb{Q}}(m)$, to the Galois group $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. A fundamental result of class field theory is that this map is surjective. Our derivation provides the central formula needed to prove this fact.\n\nThe proof of surjectivity proceeds as follows:\n1.  We seek to show that for any given automorphism $\\sigma_k \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $[k]_m \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$, there exists an ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\in I_{\\mathbb{Q}}(m)$ such that $\\operatorname{Art}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}) = \\sigma_k$.\n2.  Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions guarantees that for any such integer $k$ with $\\gcd(k, m)=1$, there exist infinitely many prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\equiv k \\pmod m$.\n3.  Let's choose one such prime $p$. The ideal $(p)$ belongs to $I_{\\mathbb{Q}}(m)$ since $p \\nmid m$.\n4.  Our derivation established that the Artin symbol for this prime ideal is $\\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(p)}\\right) = \\sigma_p$.\n5.  Since $p \\equiv k \\pmod m$, the automorphisms $\\sigma_p$ and $\\sigma_k$ are identical, as they both map $\\zeta_m$ to $\\zeta_m^p = \\zeta_m^k$.\n6.  Therefore, we have found an ideal, namely $(p)$, that maps to the arbitrary automorphism $\\sigma_k$. This demonstrates that the Artin map $\\operatorname{Art}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}: I_{\\mathbb{Q}}(m) \\to \\operatorname{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is surjective.\n\nThe explicit calculation of the symbol for $a>0$ with $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$ shows that principal ideals $(a)$ generated by such integers are in the kernel of the Artin map. This is a crucial observation, as the main theorem of global class field theory states that the Artin map induces an isomorphism from the ray class group $\\operatorname{Cl}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(m) = I_{\\mathbb{Q}}(m) / P_{\\mathbb{Q},1}(m)$ to the Galois group, where $P_{\\mathbb{Q},1}(m)$ is the subgroup of principal ideals $(\\alpha)$ with $\\alpha>0$ and $\\alpha \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$. Our computation verifies that $P_{\\mathbb{Q},1}(m)$ is indeed contained in $\\ker(\\operatorname{Art}_{L/\\mathbb{Q}})$.\n\nIn summary, the derivation of the explicit formula $\\left(\\frac{L/\\mathbb{Q}}{(a)}\\right) = \\sigma_a$ is the cornerstone of the theory for cyclotomic fields, from which both the surjectivity of the Artin map and the full isomorphism theorem of class field theory for this case can be established.\n\nThe final answer requested is the element of $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ for the case $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. As shown, the automorphism is $\\sigma_1$, which corresponds to the identity element $[1]_m \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$. The integer representative of this class is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3024935"}, {"introduction": "The Artin symbol's utility extends far beyond abelian extensions, forming a cornerstone of modern number theory. This practice ventures into the non-abelian realm with the splitting field of $f(x) = x^3 - 2$, where the Frobenius element is a conjugacy class rather than a single automorphism [@problem_id:3024933]. By relating the cycle structure of this class to the factorization pattern of $f(x)$ modulo various primes, you will develop a concrete intuition for a concept that is foundational to advanced topics like the Langlands program.", "problem": "Let $K$ be the splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$, and let $G = \\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_3$, the symmetric group on three letters. For a rational prime $p$ that is unramified in $K$, the Artin symbol (Frobenius element) at $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{Frob}_p \\in G$, is the conjugacy class determined by the action of the Frobenius automorphism on the roots of $f(x)$ modulo $p$. The cycle type of $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is determined by the factorization pattern of $f(x)$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$: three linear factors correspond to the identity class, one linear times one irreducible quadratic corresponds to a transposition class, and an irreducible cubic corresponds to a three-cycle class. Consider the unramified primes $p \\in \\{5,7,11,13,17,19\\}$. Determine the Frobenius conjugacy class $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ in $S_3$ for each such $p$ by factoring $f(x)$ modulo $p$ and matching the cycle type to the appropriate conjugacy class.

It is a well-posed problem within the domains of algebraic number theory and representation theory, with no scientific or logical flaws.\n\nThe task is to compute the sum $S = \\sum_{p \\in \\{5,7,11,13,17,19\\}} \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_p)$, where $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}$ is the character of the standard $2$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_3$, and $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is the Artin symbol for the Galois extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $K$ is the splitting field of $f(x) = x^3 - 2$.\n\nThe solution consists of three parts:\n1.  Determining the values of the character $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}$ for each conjugacy class of $S_3$.\n2.  For each prime $p$ in the given set, determining the conjugacy class of $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ by analyzing the factorization of $f(x) \\pmod p$.\n3.  Summing the corresponding character values.\n\nFirst, we determine the character $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}$. The group $S_3$ has three conjugacy classes, which correspond to the cycle structures of the permutations:\n- The identity class, $C_e = \\{e\\}$, corresponding to cycle type $1+1+1$.\n- The class of transpositions, $C_{(12)} = \\{(12), (13), (23)\\}$, corresponding to cycle type $2+1$.\n- The class of $3$-cycles, $C_{(123)} = \\{(123), (132)\\}$, corresponding to cycle type $3$.\n\nThe character $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}$ can be found by considering the standard permutation representation of $S_3$ on $\\mathbb{C}^3$, whose character $\\chi_{\\text{perm}}$ counts the number of fixed points of a permutation. This representation decomposes into the direct sum of the trivial representation (with character $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}$) and the standard $2$-dimensional representation (with character $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}$). Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}} = \\chi_{\\text{perm}} - \\chi_{\\text{triv}}$.\n\nThe character values are:\n- For the identity class $C_e$: $\\chi_{\\text{perm}}(e)=3$, $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}(e)=1$. So, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(e) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n- For the transposition class $C_{(12)}$: $\\chi_{\\text{perm}}((12))=1$, $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}((12))=1$. So, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}((12)) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n- For the $3$-cycle class $C_{(123)}$: $\\chi_{\\text{perm}}((123))=0$, $\\chi_{\\text{triv}}((123))=1$. So, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}((123)) = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n\nSecond, we determine the conjugacy class of $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ for each prime $p \\in \\{5,7,11,13,17,19\\}$. The problem states that the cycle type of $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ matches the factorization pattern of $f(x)=x^3-2$ modulo $p$.\n- $f(x)$ splits into three linear factors: $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is the identity, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_p)=2$.\n- $f(x)$ splits into one linear and one irreducible quadratic factor: $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is a transposition, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_p)=0$.\n- $f(x)$ is irreducible: $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is a $3$-cycle, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_p)=-1$.\n\nThe factorization of $x^3-2$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ depends on the congruence class of $p$ modulo $3$.\n- If $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, the mapping $y \\mapsto y^3$ is a permutation of $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Thus, $x^3-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ has exactly one solution in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This means $f(x)$ factors into one linear and one irreducible quadratic factor. The primes in the given set satisfying this are $p=5$, $p=11$, and $p=17$. For these primes, $\\operatorname{Frob}_p$ is in the transposition class.\n    - For $p \\in \\{5, 11, 17\\}$, we have $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_p) = 0$.\n\n- If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, the equation $x^3-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ has either three distinct solutions or no solutions in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This depends on whether $2$ is a cubic residue modulo $p$. According to Euler's criterion for cubic residues, $2$ is a cubic residue modulo $p$ if and only if $2^{(p-1)/3} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. If this holds, $f(x)$ splits completely. If not, $f(x)$ is irreducible. The primes in the given set satisfying $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ are $p=7$, $p=13$, and $p=19$.\n    - For $p=7$: We evaluate $2^{(7-1)/3} = 2^2 = 4 \\pmod 7$. As $4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$, $2$ is not a cubic residue. Thus, $x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_7$. $\\operatorname{Frob}_7$ is in the $3$-cycle class, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_7) = -1$.\n    - For $p=13$: We evaluate $2^{(13-1)/3} = 2^4 = 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$. As $3 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, $2$ is not a cubic residue. Thus, $x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$. $\\operatorname{Frob}_{13}$ is in the $3$-cycle class, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_{13}) = -1$.\n    - For $p=19$: We evaluate $2^{(19-1)/3} = 2^6 = 64 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{19}$. As $7 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{19}$, $2$ is not a cubic residue. Thus, $x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_{19}$. $\\operatorname{Frob}_{19}$ is in the $3$-cycle class, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_{19}) = -1$.\n\nThird, we compute the sum $S$:\n$$\nS = \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_5) + \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_7) + \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_{11}) + \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_{13}) + \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_{17}) + \\chi_{\\mathrm{std}}(\\operatorname{Frob}_{19})\n$$\n$$\nS = 0 + (-1) + 0 + (-1) + 0 + (-1)\n$$\n$$\nS = -3\n$$\nThe sum is an exact integer as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-3}$$", "id": "3024933"}]}
