The tasks are precise and relate to standard properties of such numbers.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in formal mathematical language, free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we prove that $x$ is a Liouville number. A real number $x$ is a Liouville number if for every positive integer $m$, the inequality $\\left|x - \\frac{p}{q}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q^m}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $q > 1$.\n\nWe will use the sequence of convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ of $x$ as our rational approximations. Since $a_n$ are positive integers for all $n \\ge 1$, the denominators $q_n$ form a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers for $n \\ge 1$ ($q_1=1, q_2=2, q_3=9, \\dots$). Thus, the convergents form an infinite set of distinct rational numbers.\n\nFor any $n \\ge 1$, we are given the relation $a_{n+1} = q_n^n$. We substitute this into the fundamental inequality for continued fraction approximations, which is valid for $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{a_{n+1} q_n^2} = \\frac{1}{q_n^n \\cdot q_n^2} = \\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}}\n$$\nNow, let $m \\ge 1$ be an arbitrary integer. We want to show that there are infinitely many $n$ for which $\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n^m}$.\nFrom the inequality derived above, this condition is satisfied if:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}}  \\frac{1}{q_n^m}\n$$\nSince $q_n \\ge 1$ for all $n \\ge 1$, this is equivalent to $q_n^{n+2} > q_n^m$, which simplifies to $n+2 > m$, or $n > m-2$.\n\nFor any fixed integer $m$, the condition $n > m-2$ is satisfied for an infinite number of integers $n$. Let's ensure our indices are valid, so we must also have $n \\ge 1$. The condition becomes $n \\ge \\max(1, m-1)$. For every integer $n$ in this infinite set, the corresponding convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ satisfies:\n$$\n\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}} \\le \\frac{1}{q_n^m}\n$$\nThis establishes that for any integer $m \\ge 1$, there exists an infinite sequence of distinct rational numbers (the convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ for $n \\ge \\max(1, m-1)$) satisfying the required inequality. Therefore, $x$ is a Liouville number.\n\nSecond, we compute the irrationality exponent $\\mu(x)$, which is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu(x) := \\sup\\left\\{\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\left|x - \\frac{p}{q}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q^{\\,\\mu}} \\text{ for infinitely many } \\frac{p}{q} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\right\\}\n$$\nLet $S$ be the set of real numbers $\\mu$ for which the inequality has infinitely many solutions. We want to find $\\sup S$.\nLet $\\mu_0$ be an arbitrary real number. We test whether $\\mu_0 \\in S$. We again use the convergents $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ as our candidate solutions for $\\frac{p}{q}$.\nAs shown before, for $n \\ge 1$, we have the inequality:\n$$\n\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}}\n$$\nFor the convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ to be a solution for the exponent $\\mu_0$, it must satisfy $\\left|x - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n^{\\mu_0}}$.\nThis is guaranteed if $\\frac{1}{q_n^{n+2}} \\le \\frac{1}{q_n^{\\mu_0}}$. As $q_n > 1$ for $n \\ge 2$, this is equivalent to $n+2 \\ge \\mu_0$, or $n \\ge \\mu_0 - 2$.\n\nFor any given real number $\\mu_0$, the set of integers $n$ satisfying $n \\ge \\max(2, \\mu_0 - 2)$ is infinite. For each such $n$, the convergent $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ satisfies the inequality for the exponent $\\mu_0$. This means that for any real number $\\mu_0$, there are infinitely many rational approximations $\\frac{p}{q}$ such that $\\left|x-\\frac{p}{q}\\right|  \\frac{1}{q^{\\mu_0}}$.\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ contains every real number, i.e., $S = \\mathbb{R}$. The supremum of a set that is not bounded above is infinity.\n$$\n\\mu(x) = \\sup(\\mathbb{R}) = \\infty\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the fact that $x$ is a Liouville number, as the condition for being a Liouville number is equivalent to having an infinite irrationality exponent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\infty}$$", "id": "3029847"}, {"introduction": "After constructing a Liouville number, it is natural to investigate other known transcendental numbers.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the fundamental principles of continued fractions. For an irrational number $\\alpha = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\dots]$ with convergents $p_n/q_n$, the following properties hold.\nThe denominators $q_n$ of the convergents are given by the recurrence relation $q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 0$, with initial conditions $q_{-2}=1, q_{-1}=0$. The first few denominators for $e$ are:\n$a_0=2 \\implies q_0 = a_0 q_{-1} + q_{-2} = 2(0)+1 = 1$.\n$a_1=1 \\implies q_1 = a_1 q_0 + q_{-1} = 1(1)+0 = 1$.\n$a_2=2 \\implies q_2 = a_2 q_1 + q_0 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n$a_3=1 \\implies q_3 = a_3 q_2 + q_1 = 1(3)+1 = 4$.\nThe error in approximation by the $n$th convergent is bounded by\n$$ \\frac{1}{q_n(q_{n+1}+q_n)}  \\left| \\alpha - \\frac{p_n}{q_n} \\right|  \\frac{1}{q_n q_{n+1}} $$\nUsing $q_{n+1} = a_{n+1}q_n + q_{n-1}$, we can establish the tighter and more useful bounds:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(a_{n+1}+2)q_n^2}  \\left| \\alpha - \\frac{p_n}{q_n} \\right|  \\frac{1}{a_{n+1}q_n^2} $$\nThese principles are sufficient to analyze each statement.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThe statement is that there exist infinitely many indices $n$ such that $|\\,e - p_n/q_n\\,|  1/q_n^3$.\nFrom the upper bound on the error, a sufficient (though not strictly necessary) condition for this inequality to hold is $\\frac{1}{a_{n+1}q_n^2}  \\frac{1}{q_n^3}$, which simplifies to $q_n  a_{n+1}$.\nLet's examine this condition. The sequence of partial quotients $a_n$ is given by $a_{3k-2}=1, a_{3k-1}=2k, a_{3k}=1$ for $k \\ge 1$. Thus, $a_n$ grows at most linearly with $n$.\nThe sequence of denominators $q_n$ is strictly increasing for $n \\ge 2$ and grows at least as fast as the Fibonacci sequence (since $a_n \\ge 1$ for $n \\ge 1$), which has exponential growth. In fact, due to the large terms $a_{3k-1}=2k$, a more careful analysis shows that $q_n$ grows super-exponentially.\nThe inequality $q_n  a_{n+1}$ compares a sequence with at least exponential growth ($q_n$) to one with linear growth ($a_{n+1}$). Such an inequality can only hold for a finite number of small $n$.\nLet's check for the indices $n=3k-2$, where $a_{n+1}=a_{3k-1}=2k$ is largest. We test if $q_{3k-2}  2k$:\n- For $k=1$, $n=1$. $q_1=1$ and $a_2=2$. Is $1  2$? Yes.\n- For $k=2$, $n=4$. We compute $q_4 = a_4 q_3 + q_2 = 1(4)+3 = 7$. $a_5=2(2)=4$. Is $7  4$? No.\n- For $k=3$, $n=7$. We compute $q_5=a_5q_4+q_3=4(7)+4=32$, $q_6=a_6q_5+q_4=1(32)+7=39$, $q_7=a_7q_6+q_5=1(39)+32=71$. $a_8=2(3)=6$. Is $71  6$? No.\nSince $q_n$ grows much faster than $a_{n+1}$, the condition $q_n  a_{n+1}$ is not satisfied for $k \\ge 2$. More generally, for any fixed $\\mu  2$, the inequality $|\\,e - p_n/q_n\\,|  1/q_n^\\mu$ can only hold for a finite number of convergents. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Verdict for A: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement posits that for every fixed $\\delta  0$, there exist only finitely many convergents $p_n/q_n$ of $e$ such that $|\\,e - p_n/q_n\\,|  1/q_n^{2+\\delta}$.\nUsing the bound $|\\,e - p_n/q_n\\,|  1/(a_{n+1}q_n^2)$, the inequality in the statement is satisfied if $1/(a_{n+1}q_n^2)  1/q_n^{2+\\delta}$. This simplifies to $q_n^\\delta  a_{n+1}$.\nAs established in the analysis of option A, $a_{n+1}$ grows linearly in $n$ (for example, $a_{3k-1}=2k \\approx 2n/3$), while $q_n$ grows at least exponentially. For any fixed $\\delta  0$, the function $f(n)=q_n^\\delta$ is a (super-)exponential function of $n$, whereas $g(n)=a_{n+1}$ is a linear function of $n$. An exponential function always outgrows a linear function. Therefore, the inequality $q_n^\\delta  a_{n+1}$ can only hold for a finite number of indices $n$.\nConsequently, there are only finitely many convergents satisfying the given condition.\n\n**Verdict for D: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement claims there are only finitely many rational numbers $p/q$ with $|\\,e - p/q\\,|  1/q^3$.\nThis question relates to the irrationality measure of $e$.\nConsider a rational approximation $p/q$ to $e$.\nIf $q=1$, we seek integers $p$ such that $|e-p|  1/1^3=1$. Since $e \\approx 2.71828$, the only integers $p$ satisfying this are $p=2$ and $p=3$. There are finitely many (two) such solutions.\nIf $q \\ge 2$, the inequality is $|\\,e - p/q\\,|  1/q^3$. Since $q \\ge 2$, we have $q^3 \\ge 2q^2$, so $1/q^3 \\le 1/(2q^2)$. Thus, any such rational $p/q$ must satisfy $|\\,e - p/q\\,|  1/(2q^2)$.\nA fundamental result in the theory of continued fractions (Legendre's theorem) states that if an irrational number $\\alpha$ and a rational number $p/q$ satisfy $|\\alpha - p/q|  1/(2q^2)$, then $p/q$ must be one of the convergents of $\\alpha$.\nTherefore, any rational solution $p/q$ with $q \\ge 2$ to the given inequality must be a convergent $p_n/q_n$ of $e$.\nIn the analysis of option D, we showed that for $\\delta=1$, there are only finitely many convergents satisfying $|\\,e - p_n/q_n\\,|  1/q_n^{2+1} = 1/q_n^3$.\nCombining the finite number of solutions for $q=1$ and the finite number of solutions for $q \\ge 2$ (which must be convergents), the total number of rational solutions is finite.\n\n**Verdict for B: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe statement asserts that for the subsequence $n=3k-2$, $|\\,e - p_n/q_n\\,|$ is bounded by $\\frac{1}{(2k+2)\\,q_n^2}  \\left|\\,e - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\,\\right|  \\frac{1}{2k\\,q_n^2}$.\nWe use the general sharp bounds for approximation by convergents:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(a_{n+1}+2)q_n^2}  \\left|e - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{a_{n+1}q_n^2} $$\nThese bounds are valid for any irrational number whose partial quotients are all at least $1$ (which is true for $e$ after $a_0$).\nFor the specific subsequence of indices $n = 3k - 2$ (where $k \\ge 1$), the next partial quotient is $a_{n+1} = a_{(3k-2)+1} = a_{3k-1}$.\nAccording to the problem statement, for $k \\ge 1$, we have $a_{3k-1} = 2k$.\nSubstituting $a_{n+1} = 2k$ into the general bounds gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(2k+2)q_n^2}  \\left|e - \\frac{p_n}{q_n}\\right|  \\frac{1}{2k\\,q_n^2} $$\nThis exactly matches the statement in option C.\n\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThe statement is that the sequence of partial quotients $(a_n)$ of $e$ grows at most linearly in $n$.

For $n = 3k-2$ ($k \\ge 1$): $a_n = 1$. The ratio is $\\frac{a_n}{n} = \\frac{1}{3k-2}$. For $k=1$, $n=1$, ratio is $1$. For $k \\to \\infty$, ratio $\\to 0$.\n2. For $n = 3k-1$ ($k \\ge 1$): $a_n = 2k$. The ratio is $\\frac{a_n}{n} = \\frac{2k}{3k-1}$. For $k=1$, $n=2$, ratio is $2/2=1$. For $k \\to \\infty$, ratio $\\to 2/3$. The function $f(k) = 2k/(3k-1)$ is decreasing for $k \\ge 1$, so its maximum value in this case is $1$.\n3. For $n = 3k$ ($k \\ge 1$): $a_n = 1$. The ratio is $\\frac{a_n}{n} = \\frac{1}{3k}$. For $k=1$, $n=3$, ratio is $1/3$. For $k \\to \\infty$, ratio $\\to 0$.\n\nThe set of all values of $a_n/n$ for $n \\ge 1$ is the union of these three sequences of values.

Assume $\\alpha_1  0$ and $\\alpha_2  0$ and that each is in lowest terms.\n   - Compute $D=1$ for rational inputs.\n   - Let $B = \\max\\{3,|b_1|,|b_2|\\}$.\n   - Compute the absolute logarithmic heights $h(\\alpha_i) = \\log \\max\\{|p_i|,|q_i|\\}$.\n   - Form $A_i = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_i), |\\log \\alpha_i|, 0.1\\}$.\n   - Apply a standard explicit bound for $|b_1 \\log \\alpha_1 + b_2 \\log \\alpha_2|$ that depends on $D$, $B$, and the $A_i$, specialized to two logarithms and rational inputs as described above. This bound must be nontrivial only when $\\alpha_1^{b_1}\\alpha_2^{b_2} \\neq 1$.\n\n4. Output specification:\n   - For each test case, output a single floating-point number representing the lower bound for $|b_1 \\log \\alpha_1 + b_2 \\log \\alpha_2|$ computed by your algorithm. If the exact degeneracy condition $\\alpha_1^{b_1}\\alpha_2^{b_2} = 1$ holds in $\\mathbb{Q}$, output $0$ for that case.\n   - Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[r_1,r_2,r_3]$). No units are involved. All angles are in radians by default through the use of the natural logarithm.\n\n5. Test suite:\n   - Use the following test suite of inputs to exercise different facets of correctness:\n     - Case 1 (generic nondegenerate): $\\alpha_1 = 2 = \\frac{2}{1}$, $\\alpha_2 = 3 = \\frac{3}{1}$, $b_1 = 7$, $b_2 = -5$.\n     - Case 2 (near cancellation but nondegenerate): $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{15}{14}$, $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{9}{10}$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 1$.\n     - Case 3 (exact degeneracy): $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{8}{27}$, $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{2}{3}$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = -3$.\n     - Case 4 (moderate coefficients): $\\alpha_1 = 2 = \\frac{2}{1}$, $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{5}{4}$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_2 = 1$.\n     - Case 5 (mixed signs and moderately sized rationals): $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{7}{5}$, $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{9}{7}$, $b_1 = -2$, $b_2 = 3$.\n   - Your program must encode and run exactly these five cases and aggregate the results into the specified single-line output format.", "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of an algorithm to compute an explicit numerical lower bound for the absolute value of a linear form in two logarithms, $\\Lambda = b_1 \\log \\alpha_1 + b_2 \\log \\alpha_2$, where $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$ are positive rational numbers and $b_1, b_2$ are integers. The computation must be based on the principles of transcendental number theory.\n\n### Theoretical Foundation\n\nThe core of the solution lies in applying a theorem that provides an explicit lower bound for $|\\Lambda|$ when $\\Lambda \\neq 0$. Such bounds are fundamental results in transcendental number theory, stemming from the work of Alan Baker. We will use a modern, explicit version of these results derived from a theorem by Andrej D. Matveev, as it is a standard and powerful tool for such problems.\n\nSpecifically, we will use the version presented by Bugeaud, Mignotte, and Siksek (Annals of Mathematics, 2006), which is well-suited for practical applications. For a linear form $\\Lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i \\log \\alpha_i$ with algebraic numbers $\\alpha_i$ and integers $b_i$, their theorem provides a lower bound on $|\\Lambda|$. We must specialize this theorem to the conditions of the problem: $n=2$ logarithms of rational numbers $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$.\n\nFor rational numbers, the containing number field is $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the degree $D$ is $1$. The general theorem simplifies considerably under these conditions. The theorem states that if $\\Lambda \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\log |\\Lambda|  -C(n, D) \\cdot (1 + \\log B) \\cdot A_1 \\cdots A_n\n$$\nwhere the parameters $A_i$ relate to the heights of $\\alpha_i$, $B$ is a bound on the coefficients $|b_i|$, and $C(n, D)$ is a computable constant.\n\nFollowing the problem's specifications, we define the parameters as follows:\n- The number of logarithms is $n=2$.\n- The degree is $D=1$, as $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n- The coefficients are $b_1, b_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- The rational numbers are $\\alpha_1 = p_1/q_1$ and $\\alpha_2 = p_2/q_2$, given to be in lowest terms and positive.\n- The absolute logarithmic height of a rational $\\alpha = p/q$ is $h(\\alpha) = \\log \\max\\{|p|,|q|\\}$.\n- The quantities $A_i$ are defined as $A_i = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_i), |\\log \\alpha_i|, 0.1\\}$ for $i=1,2$.\n- The bound for the coefficients is $B = \\max\\{3, |b_1|, |b_2|\\}$.\n\nThe constant from the specialized Matveev theorem (for $D=1, n=2$) is $C_0 = 1.4 \\cdot 30^{n+3} \\cdot n^{4.5} \\cdot D^2 (1+\\log D)$. With $n=2$ and $D=1$, the term $(1+\\log D)$ becomes $(1+\\log 1) = 1$, and we have:\n$$\nC_0 = 1.4 \\cdot 30^{2+3} \\cdot 2^{4.5} \\approx 7.704 \\times 10^8\n$$\nCombining these elements, the lower bound for a non-zero $\\Lambda$ is given by:\n$$\n|\\Lambda|  \\exp\\left( -C_0 \\cdot (1 + \\log B) \\cdot A_1 \\cdot A_2 \\right)\n$$\n\n### Degeneracy Condition\n\nThe above bound is valid only if $\\Lambda \\neq 0$. The case $\\Lambda = 0$ corresponds to the degeneracy condition $\\alpha_1^{b_1} \\alpha_2^{b_2} = 1$. This occurs if and only if $b_1 \\log \\alpha_1 + b_2 \\log \\alpha_2 = \\log(\\alpha_1^{b_1}\\alpha_2^{b_2}) = \\log(1) = 0$.\n\nTo check this condition without precision loss from floating-point arithmetic, we must use exact integer computations. Let $b_i = b_i^+ - b_i^-$ where $b_i^+ = \\max(b_i, 0)$ and $b_i^- = \\max(-b_i, 0)$ are non-negative integers. The condition $\\alpha_1^{b_1} \\alpha_2^{b_2} = 1$ is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{p_1}{q_1}\\right)^{b_1} \\left(\\frac{p_2}{q_2}\\right)^{b_2} = 1 \\iff p_1^{b_1^+} q_1^{b_1^-} p_2^{b_2^+} q_2^{b_2^-} = q_1^{b_1^+} p_1^{b_1^-} q_2^{b_2^+} p_2^{b_2^-}\n$$\nThis equality involves only integer powers of integers and can be verified exactly. If this identity holds, the lower bound for $|\\Lambda|$ is $0$.\n\n### Algorithmic Procedure\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in two main stages for each test case $(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, b_1, b_2)$:\n\n1.  **Check for Degeneracy**:\n    - Given inputs $(p_1, q_1)$, $(p_2, q_2)$, $b_1$, and $b_2$.\n    - Compute the left-hand side and right-hand side of the integer identity derived above using arbitrary-precision integers.\n    - If they are equal, the linear form $\\Lambda$ is zero. The result is $0.0$.\n\n2.  **Compute the Lower Bound**:\n    - If the form is non-degenerate, calculate the required parameters for the bound:\n        a. $B = \\max\\{3, |b_1|, |b_2|\\}$.\n        b. For $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, compute $\\alpha_i = p_i/q_i$.\n        c. Compute the heights $h(\\alpha_1) = \\log(\\max\\{p_1, q_1\\})$ and $h(\\alpha_2) = \\log(\\max\\{p_2, q_2\\})$. Note that since $\\alpha_i  0$ and are in lowest terms, $p_i$ and $q_i$ are positive.\n        d. Compute $A_1 = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_1), |\\log \\alpha_1|, 0.1\\}$ and $A_2 = \\max\\{h(\\alpha_2), |\\log \\alpha_2|, 0.1\\}$.\n        e. The constant is $C_0 = 1.4 \\cdot 30^5 \\cdot 2^{4.5}$.\n        f. The final numerical lower bound is calculated as $\\exp(-C_0 \\cdot (1 + \\log B) \\cdot A_1 \\cdot A_2)$.\n\nThis procedure provides a rigorous and explicit lower bound for $|\\Lambda|$, adhering to the provided definitions and leveraging a standard result from transcendental number theory.
