We will determine its characteristic ideal, Iwasawa invariants, and elementary pseudo-isomorphic decomposition.\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic ideal of $M$, denoted $\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M)$. By definition, the characteristic ideal of a finitely generated $\\Lambda$-module is its zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$. To compute this, we consider a presentation of the module $M$. The module $M = \\Lambda/(p T^{2})$ is a cyclic module, generated by one element (the residue class of $1$) subject to a single relation. This gives the following free presentation of $M$:\n$$ \\Lambda \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\Lambda \\to M \\to 0 $$\nHere, the map $\\phi$ is multiplication by the element $p T^{2}$. In terms of matrices, $M$ is generated by one element, so we have a presentation with a $1 \\times 1$ matrix. The map $\\phi$ is represented by the matrix $A = [p T^{2}]$.\n\nThe zeroth Fitting ideal, $\\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M)$, is generated by all $1 \\times 1$ minors of the presentation matrix $A$. In this case, there is only one such minor, which is the entry $p T^{2}$ itself. Therefore, the characteristic ideal is the principal ideal generated by this element:\n$$ \\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = \\operatorname{Fitt}_{0}(M) = (p T^{2}) $$\n\nNext, we are asked to find the Iwasawa invariants $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$. These invariants are determined from the unique factorization of a generator of the characteristic ideal, as guaranteed by the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem for the Iwasawa algebra $\\Lambda$. The theorem states that any non-zero element $G(T) \\in \\Lambda$ can be uniquely written as $G(T) = p^{\\mu} f(T) U(T)$, where $\\mu \\geq 0$ is an integer, $f(T)$ is a distinguished polynomial, and $U(T)$ is a unit in $\\Lambda$. A distinguished polynomial is a monic polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}[T]$ of the form $T^{\\lambda} + a_{\\lambda-1}T^{\\lambda-1} + \\dots + a_{0}$ such that all non-leading coefficients $a_{i}$ are divisible by $p$ (i.e., $a_i \\in p\\mathbb{Z}_p$). The Iwasawa invariants are then defined as $\\mu$ and $\\lambda = \\deg(f(T))$.\n\nThe generator for our characteristic ideal is $G(T) = p T^{2}$. We can write this as:\n$$ G(T) = p^{1} \\cdot T^{2} \\cdot 1 $$\nWe identify the components of this expression with the form from the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem.\nThe power of $p$ is $p^{1}$, so we have $\\mu = 1$.\nThe polynomial part is $f(T) = T^{2}$. To confirm this is a distinguished polynomial, we check its properties. It is a monic polynomial of degree $2$. Its non-leading coefficients are the coefficient of $T^{1}$, which is $0$, and the constant term, which is also $0$. Since $0$ is an element of $p\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, the polynomial $T^{2}$ is indeed a distinguished polynomial.\nThe remaining factor is $U(T) = 1$, which is a unit in $\\Lambda$.\nThus, the factorization $p^{1} \\cdot T^{2}$ is the canonical one. From this, we identify the Iwasawa invariants:\n- The $\\mu$-invariant is the exponent of $p$, so $\\mu = 1$.\n- The $\\lambda$-invariant is the degree of the distinguished polynomial $f(T) = T^{2}$, so $\\lambda = \\deg(T^{2}) = 2$.\nThe ordered pair of invariants is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, 2)$.\n\nFinally, we identify the elementary pseudo-isomorphic decomposition of $M$. The structure theorem for finitely generated torsion $\\Lambda$-modules states that any such module is pseudo-isomorphic to a direct sum of elementary modules. A pseudo-isomorphism is a $\\Lambda$-module homomorphism with a finite kernel and cokernel. The structure of this direct sum is determined by the characteristic ideal.\n$$ M \\sim \\left( \\bigoplus_{i} \\Lambda/(p^{a_i}) \\right) \\oplus \\left( \\bigoplus_{j} \\Lambda/(g_j(T)^{b_j}) \\right) $$\nwhere each $g_j(T)$ is an irreducible distinguished polynomial. The characteristic ideal of such a direct sum is the principal ideal generated by the product of the individual generators: $\\left( p^{\\sum a_i} \\prod g_j(T)^{b_j} \\right)$.\n\nWe must match this form with our characteristic ideal $\\operatorname{char}_{\\Lambda}(M) = (p T^{2})$. The generator is $p^{1} T^{2}$.\nThe $p$-power part of the generator is $p^{1}$. This corresponds to a direct summand $\\Lambda/(p^{1}) = \\Lambda/(p)$. Thus, $\\sum a_i = 1$, which implies a single summand with $a_1=1$.\nThe polynomial part of the generator is $T^{2}$. The polynomial $g(T) = T$ is a distinguished polynomial of degree $1$ (it is monic and its constant term is $0 \\in p\\mathbb{Z}_p$) and is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[T]$ as it is of degree $1$. The factorization of the polynomial part is $T^{2} = g(T)^{2}$. This corresponds to a direct summand $\\Lambda/(T^{2})$.\nCombining these, the pseudo-isomorphic decomposition of $M$ is:\n$$ M = \\Lambda/(p T^{2}) \\sim \\Lambda/(p) \\oplus \\Lambda/(T^{2}) $$\n\nThe components of this decomposition are the $p$-power component arising from the $\\mu$-invariant, which is $\\Lambda/(p)$, and the distinguished polynomial component $\\Lambda/(T^2)$, where $T^2$ is the distinguished polynomial factor from which the $\\lambda$-invariant is derived.

We are given a nonzero element $f(T) \\in \\Lambda$, which we will denote simply as $f$. We consider the cyclic torsion $\\Lambda$-module $M = \\Lambda/(f)$. We want to construct an explicit finite free resolution of $M$.\n\nThe module $M$ is the quotient of the ring $\\Lambda$ by the principal ideal $(f)$ generated by $f$. By definition of a quotient module, there is a canonical surjective $\\Lambda$-module homomorphism $\\pi: \\Lambda \\to M$ whose kernel is $(f)$.

The image of this map is precisely the ideal $(f)$. The problem states that $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_{p}[[T]]$ is a domain and that $f$ is a nonzero element. In a domain, a nonzero element is not a zero-divisor. Therefore, the kernel of $\\mu_f$ is trivial, i.e., $\\ker(\\mu_f) = \\{0\\}$, and the map $\\mu_f$ is injective.\n\nThis means that $\\mu_f$ provides a $\\Lambda$-module isomorphism between $\\Lambda$ and its image, the ideal $(f)$:\n$$\n\\Lambda \\cong (f)\n$$\nWe can substitute $\\Lambda$ for $(f)$ in the short exact sequence above, by replacing the inclusion map with the map $\\mu_f$.

Let $C_{\\bullet}$ denote this complex, with $C_1 = \\Lambda/(T)$, $C_0 = \\Lambda/(T)$, and $C_i = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 1$. The differential is $d_1 = \\overline{\\mu_f}$.\n\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{i}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = H_i(C_{\\bullet})$.

Since $C_2=0$, the map $d_2$ is the zero map, so $\\text{im}(d_2) = 0$. Thus, $H_1(C_{\\bullet}) = \\ker(d_1) = \\ker(\\overline{\\mu_f})$. This is the kernel of the map \"multiplication by $f$\" on $\\Lambda/(T)$.\n\nFor $i \\geq 2$:\nSince $C_i=0$ for all $i \\geq 2$, the homology groups $H_i(C_{\\bullet})$ are all trivial. Thus, $\\operatorname{Tor}^{\\Lambda}_{i}(\\Lambda/(T), \\Lambda/(f)) = 0$ for all $i \\ge 2$.\n\nTo be more explicit, we analyze the module $\\Lambda/(T)$. Since $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$, the quotient by the ideal $(T)$ is $\\Lambda/(T) = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]/(T) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p$. The isomorphism sends a power series $g(T) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[[T]]$ to its constant term $g(0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$. The action of multiplication by $f$ on an element $g+(T) \\in \\Lambda/(T)$ is $f \\cdot g + (T)$. Under the isomorphism to $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, this corresponds to multiplication by $f(0)$ on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Let $\\mu_{f(0)}$ be this map.
