The group law on $E(K)$ is defined by the chord-tangent construction: for points $P,Q\\in E(K)$, the line through $P$ and $Q$ (tangent to $E$ at $P$ when $P=Q$) meets $E$ at a third point $R$, and $P+Q$ is the image of $R$ under the involution $[-1]$ on $E$ that fixes the $x$-coordinate and negates with respect to the group law.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the fundamental algebraic fact that the sum of the roots of a monic polynomial equals the negative of the coefficient of its quadratic term (Viète’s relation), carry out the following derivations in $K(x,y)$:\n\n1.

Derivation of the Inversion Map**\n\nThe inversion map for the group law, denoted by $[-1]$, is the reflection that maps a point $R$ to the sum $P+Q$. Geometrically, the inverse of a point $P=(x,y)$, denoted $-P$, is the second point on the curve with the same $x$-coordinate, such that the line through $P$ and $-P$ is a vertical line, which intersects the curve at the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$. The sum $P+(-P)$ is then the reflection of $\\mathcal{O}$, which is $\\mathcal{O}$ itself, the identity of the group.\n\nTo find the coordinates of $-P$, we rearrange the Weierstrass equation for a fixed value of $x$ to form a quadratic equation in the variable $y$:\n$$\ny^{2} + (a_{1}x+a_{3})y - (x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}) = 0.\n$$\nThis is a monic quadratic equation in $y$ of the form $y^2+By+C=0$, where $B = a_1x+a_3$. For a given $x \\in K$ (for which there are solutions), there are two solutions for $y$, say $y_1$ and $y_2$, which correspond to the $y$-coordinates of the two points on the curve with that $x$-coordinate. According to Viète's formulas, the sum of the roots of this quadratic equation is equal to the negative of the coefficient of the linear term. Thus, the sum of the $y$-solutions is:\n$$\ny_{1} + y_{2} = -(a_{1}x+a_{3}).\n$$\nIf one point is $(x,y)$, its vertical partner on the curve is $(x,y')$, where $y+y' = -(a_{1}x+a_{3})$. This gives $y' = -y - a_{1}x - a_{3}$. The inversion map $[-1]$ is precisely this mapping. Therefore, for a point $(x,y) \\in E(K)$, its image under the inversion map is:\n$$\n[-1](x,y) = (x, -y - a_{1}x - a_{3}).\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Addition Formula for Distinct Points**\n\nLet $P=(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $Q=(x_{2}, y_{2})$ be two distinct points on the curve $E(K)$ with $x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$. The line passing through $P$ and $Q$, known as the chord, is given by the equation $y=\\lambda x+\\nu$.\n\nThe slope $\\lambda$ is determined by the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}.\n$$\nThe $y$-intercept $\\nu$ can be found by substituting the coordinates of either point, for instance $P$:\n$$\ny_{1} = \\lambda x_{1} + \\nu \\implies \\nu = y_{1} - \\lambda x_{1}.\n$$\nTo find the third point of intersection, $R = (x_{R}, y_{R})$, we substitute the line equation $y=\\lambda x+\\nu$ into the Weierstrass equation:\n$$\n(\\lambda x+\\nu)^{2} + a_{1}x(\\lambda x+\\nu) + a_{3}(\\lambda x+\\nu) = x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}.\n$$\nWe expand the terms and rearrange the equation into a cubic polynomial in $x$:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2}x^{2} + 2\\lambda\\nu x + \\nu^{2} + a_{1}\\lambda x^{2} + a_{1}\\nu x + a_{3}\\lambda x + a_{3}\\nu = x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}.\n$$\nCollecting all terms on one side yields a monic cubic equation whose roots are the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points:\n$$\nx^{3} + (a_{2} - a_{1}\\lambda - \\lambda^{2})x^{2} + (a_{4} - a_{1}\\nu - a_{3}\\lambda - 2\\lambda\\nu)x + (a_{6} - \\nu^{2} - a_{3}\\nu) = 0.\n$$\nThe three roots of this cubic are $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{R}$. Applying Viète's relation for the sum of the roots, we find:\n$$\nx_{1} + x_{2} + x_{R} = -(a_{2} - a_{1}\\lambda - \\lambda^{2}) = \\lambda^{2} + a_{1}\\lambda - a_{2}.\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the $x$-coordinate of the third intersection point, $x_{R}$:\n$$\nx_{R} = \\lambda^{2} + a_{1}\\lambda - a_{2} - x_{1} - x_{2}.\n$$\nAccording to the group law definition, the sum $P+Q$ is the reflection of $R$ under the map $[-1]$. As shown in part $1$, this map fixes the $x$-coordinate. Let $P+Q = (x_{P+Q}, y_{P+Q})$. Then, $x_{P+Q} = x_{R}$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $P+Q$ is:\n$$\nx_{P+Q} = \\lambda^{2} + a_{1}\\lambda - a_{2} - x_{1} - x_{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$, we obtain the final formula for the $x$-coordinate of the sum:\n$$\nx_{P+Q} = \\left(\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\right)^{2} + a_{1}\\left(\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\right) - a_{2} - x_{1} - x_{2}.\n$$\nThis is the required expression, valid for $x_1 \\neq x_2$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Tangent Slope for Point Doubling**\n\nTo find the slope of the tangent line at a point $P=(x_{1}, y_{1})$ on the curve, we perform implicit differentiation of the Weierstrass equation with respect to $x$. Let $y' = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation is $F(x,y) = y^{2}+a_{1}xy+a_{3}y - x^{3}-a_{2}x^{2}-a_{4}x-a_{6}=0$. Differentiating gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dx} = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0.\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = a_{1}y - 3x^{2} - 2a_{2}x - a_{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y + a_{1}x + a_{3}\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{\\partial F/\\partial x}{\\partial F/\\partial y} = -\\frac{a_{1}y - 3x^{2} - 2a_{2}x - a_{4}}{2y + a_{1}x + a_{3}} = \\frac{3x^{2} + 2a_{2}x + a_{4} - a_{1}y}{2y + a_{1}x + a_{3}}.\n$$\nThe tangent slope $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{tan}}$ at the point $P=(x_{1}, y_{1})$ is the value of this derivative evaluated at that point:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{tan}} = \\frac{3x_{1}^{2} + 2a_{2}x_{1} + a_{4} - a_{1}y_{1}}{2y_{1} + a_{1}x_{1} + a_{3}}.\n$$\nThis expression is valid provided the denominator is non-zero, i.e., $2y_{1} + a_{1}x_{1} + a_{3} \\neq 0$. This condition corresponds to the tangent line at $P$ not being vertical. For point doubling, $2P = P+P$, this slope $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{tan}}$ would be used in the addition formula in place of the chord slope $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\right)^{2} + a_{1}\\left(\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\right) - a_{2} - x_{1} - x_{2}}\n$$", "id": "3026549"}, {"introduction": "Now that the general mechanics of the group law are established, we can explore special points that reveal key aspects of the group's structure.

The denominator is $3297856 = 1816^2 = (8 \\cdot 227)^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 227^2$. The numerator $23755489$ is not divisible by $2$. A check reveals it is also not divisible by the prime $227$. Therefore, the fraction is in lowest terms.\n\nThe two methods yield identical results, confirming the correctness of the calculations. The final answer is the computed value for $x(4P)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{23755489}{3297856}}\n$$", "id": "3026546"}]}
