This is the equation for the line at infinity in $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$. The homogeneous linear form $L(X,Y,Z)$ that defines this line is simply $Z$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must explain how this tangent direction relates to the vertical direction in the affine plane. We consider the affine chart defined by $Z=1$, where the coordinates are $(x,y)$ with $x=X/Z$ and $y=Y/Z$.\n\nA vertical line in this affine plane is defined by an equation of the form $x=c$ for some constant $c \\in k$. To understand its behavior in the projective plane, we homogenize this equation. Substituting $x=X/Z$, we get $X/Z=c$, which yields the homogeneous linear equation $X - cZ = 0$. This equation defines a line in $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$ that is the projective closure of the affine line $x=c$.\n\nTo find the \"direction\" of this family of parallel vertical lines, we find their common point of intersection in the projective plane. In projective geometry, parallel lines meet at a point on the line at infinity. The line at infinity is given by the equation $Z=0$. The intersection of a vertical line $X-cZ=0$ and the line at infinity $Z=0$ is found by solving the system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nX - cZ = 0 \\\\\nZ = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting $Z=0$ into the first equation immediately gives $X=0$. The coordinate $Y$ is not constrained by these equations. Thus, the intersection point is of the form $[0:Y:0]$. Since projective coordinates are homogeneous, we can scale by $Y^{-1}$ (for $Y \\neq 0$) to obtain the unique point $[0:1:0]$. This is precisely the point $O$.\n\nThis shows that the point $O=[0:1:0]$ on the curve $E$ is the point at infinity through which the projective closures of all vertical affine lines pass. Therefore, the point $O$ is the representation of the \"vertical direction\" in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$.\n\nThe connection is now clear: the tangent line to the curve $E$ *at the point that represents the vertical direction* (the point $O$) is the line $L(X,Y,Z)=Z=0$. In other words, the curve is tangent to the line at infinity at the point $O$.

The point in question is $P = (1:2:1)$. First, we confirm that $P$ lies on the curve $C$ by substituting its homogeneous coordinates into the polynomial:\n$$ F(1,2,1) = (2)^{2}(1) - (1)^{3} - (1)(1)^{2} - 2(1)^{3} = 4 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 0 $$\nSince the result is $0$, the point $P$ is indeed on the curve $C$.\n\n**Task 1: Verify that $P$ is a nonsingular point.**\n\nA point on a projective curve defined by $F(X,Y,Z)=0$ is nonsingular if the gradient of $F$ does not vanish at that point.

Since this vector is not the zero vector $(0,0,0)$, the point $P$ is a nonsingular point on the curve $C$.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the tangent line and justify that it passes through $P$.**\n\nThe tangent line to a projective curve $F=0$ at a nonsingular point $P_{0}=(X_{0}:Y_{0}:Z_{0})$ is defined by the linear equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P_{0}) \\cdot X + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P_{0}) \\cdot Y + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P_{0}) \\cdot Z = 0 $$\nUsing the gradient components calculated in Task 1 for the point $P=(1:2:1)$, the equation of the tangent line is:\n$$ (-4)X + (4)Y + (-4)Z = 0 $$\nDividing the entire equation by the common factor $-4$ yields the simplified form:\n$$ X - Y + Z = 0 $$\nThis is the equation of the projective tangent line to $C$ at $P$.\n\nTo justify from first principles that this line passes through $P$, we use Euler's homogeneous function theorem. The polynomial $F(X,Y,Z)$ is homogeneous of degree $d=3$. The theorem states that for any such polynomial:\n$$ X \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X} + Y \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y} + Z \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z} = d \\cdot F $$\nFor any point $P_{0}=(X_{0},Y_{0},Z_{0})$ on the curve $C$, we have $F(X_{0},Y_{0},Z_{0})=0$. Substituting this into Euler's theorem, we get:\n$$ X_{0} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P_{0}) + Y_{0} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P_{0}) + Z_{0} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P_{0}) = 3 \\cdot F(P_{0}) = 3 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThis equation demonstrates that the coordinates of any point $P_{0}$ on the curve satisfy the equation of the line whose coefficients are the components of the gradient evaluated at that same point $P_{0}$. Thus, the point $P_{0}$ lies on its own tangent line. For our specific point $P=(1,2,1)$, this is:\n$$ (1) \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P)\\right) + (2) \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P)\\right) + (1) \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P)\\right) = (1)(-4) + (2)(4) + (1)(-4) = -4 + 8 - 4 = 0 $$\nThis confirms that $P$ is on the line $X - Y + Z = 0$.\n\n**Task 3: Dehomogenize and find the slope.**\n\nWe dehomogenize to the affine chart where $Z \\neq 0$ by setting $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$. To find the affine equation of the curve, we divide the homogeneous equation $Y^{2} Z - X^{3} - X Z^{2} - 2 Z^{3} = 0$ by $Z^{3}$:\n$$ \\frac{Y^{2}Z}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{X^{3}}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{XZ^{2}}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{2Z^{3}}{Z^{3}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{Z}\\right)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right)^{3} - \\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right) - 2 = 0 $$\n$$ y^{2} = x^{3} + x + 2 $$\nThe projective point $P=(1:2:1)$ corresponds to the affine point $p=(x,y)=(1/1, 2/1) = (1,2)$.\n\nTo find the affine tangent line, we dehomogenize the projective tangent line equation $X - Y + Z = 0$. Since we are in the chart $Z \\neq 0$, we can divide by $Z$:\n$$ \\frac{X}{Z} - \\frac{Y}{Z} + \\frac{Z}{Z} = 0 $$\n$$ x - y + 1 = 0 $$\nThe problem asks for this line to be expressed in the form $y = mx + b$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ y = x + 1 $$\nBy comparing this to the form $y = mx + b$, we can identify the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$. The slope is $m=1$.\n\n**Task 4: Prove the well-definedness of the tangent line.**\n\nLet $P = (X_{P}:Y_{P}:Z_{P})$ be a nonsingular point on the curve $C$. Any other homogeneous representative of this point can be written as $P_{\\lambda} = (\\lambda X_{P}, \\lambda Y_{P}, \\lambda Z_{P})$ for some nonzero scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\times}$.\nThe polynomial $F$ is homogeneous of degree $d=3$. Its first-order partial derivatives, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}$, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}$, and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}$, are homogeneous polynomials of degree $d-1 = 2$.\nBy the definition of a homogeneous function of degree $k$, for any of these partial derivatives (let's use $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}$ as an example), we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P_{\\lambda}) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(\\lambda X_{P}, \\lambda Y_{P}, \\lambda Z_{P}) = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(X_{P}, Y_{P}, Z_{P}) = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P) $$\nThe same relationship holds for the other partial derivatives. Therefore, the gradient vector at $P_{\\lambda}$ is:\n$$ \\nabla F(P_{\\lambda}) = \\left(\\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial X}(P), \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Y}(P), \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial Z}(P)\\right) = \\lambda^{2} \\nabla F(P) $$\nThe tangent line at $P$ is given by the linear form $L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = \\nabla F(P) \\cdot (X,Y,Z) = 0$.\nThe tangent line at $P_{\\lambda}$ is given by the linear form $L_{P_{\\lambda}}(X,Y,Z) = \\nabla F(P_{\\lambda}) \\cdot (X,Y,Z) = 0$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nabla F(P_{\\lambda})$, we get:\n$$ L_{P_{\\lambda}}(X,Y,Z) = (\\lambda^{2} \\nabla F(P)) \\cdot (X,Y,Z) = \\lambda^{2} (\\nabla F(P) \\cdot (X,Y,Z)) = \\lambda^{2} L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = 0 $$\nSince $\\lambda \\neq 0$, $\\lambda^{2} \\neq 0$. The equation $\\lambda^{2} L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = 0$ is equivalent to the equation $L_{P}(X,Y,Z) = 0$. This means that the set of points $(X:Y:Z)$ satisfying the linear form for the tangent at $P_{\\lambda}$ is identical to the set of points satisfying the linear form for the tangent at $P$.\nIn projective geometry, two linear forms that are nonzero scalar multiples of each other define the same line. The vector of coefficients for the tangent line at $P_{\\lambda}$ is $\\nabla F(P_{\\lambda})$, which is a nonzero scalar multiple of the vector of coefficients for the tangent line at $P$, $\\nabla F(P)$. Therefore, both representatives $P$ and $P_{\\lambda}$ define the exact same projective tangent line.
