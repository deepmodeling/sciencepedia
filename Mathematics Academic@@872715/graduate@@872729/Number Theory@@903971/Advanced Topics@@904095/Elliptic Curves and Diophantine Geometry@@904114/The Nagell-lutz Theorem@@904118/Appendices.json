We are provided with the necessary tools: the injectivity of the reduction map for primes of good reduction and the Lutz–Nagell theorem.\n\nThe given elliptic curve is $E \\colon y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ with integer coefficients $a = -2$ and $b = 2$.\nFirst, we compute the discriminant of the curve, $\\Delta$. The formula for the discriminant is $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$.\n$$\n\\Delta = -16(4(-2)^3 + 27(2)^2) = -16(4(-8) + 27(4)) = -16(-32 + 108) = -16(76) = -1216\n$$\nSince $1216 = 2^6 \\times 19$, the primes of bad reduction for $E$ are the prime divisors of $\\Delta$, which are $p=2$ and $p=19$. For any prime $p$ other than $2$ or $19$, the curve $E$ has good reduction modulo $p$.\n\nWe use the fact that for a prime $p$ of good reduction, the reduction map $\\rho_p \\colon E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is an injective group homomorphism. A consequence of this injectivity is that the order of the torsion subgroup, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$, must divide the order of the group of points on the reduced curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, which is $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$.\n\nLet's compute $|E(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$ for a few small primes of good reduction.\n\n1.  Reduction modulo $p=3$:\n    The curve equation becomes $E_3 \\colon y^2 \\equiv x^3 - 2x + 2 \\pmod 3$, which simplifies to $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + x + 2 \\pmod 3$. We count the points $(x,y)$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The possible values for $y^2$ in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 2^2 \\equiv 1$.\n    Let's evaluate the right-hand side, $f(x) = x^3 + x + 2$, for each value of $x$:\n    -   If $x=0$, $f(0) = 0^3 + 0 + 2 = 2$. This is not a quadratic residue modulo $3$, so there are no points.\n    -   If $x=1$, $f(1) = 1^3 + 1 + 2 = 4 \\equiv 1$. Since $y^2=1$, we have $y=1$ or $y=2$. This gives two points: $(1,1)$ and $(1,2)$.\n    -   If $x=2$, $f(2) = 2^3 + 2 + 2 = 8 + 4 = 12 \\equiv 0$. Since $y^2=0$, we have $y=0$. This gives one point: $(2,0)$.\n    The finite points on $E(\\mathbb{F}_3)$ are $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, and $(2,0)$. Including the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$, the total number of points is $|E(\\mathbb{F}_3)| = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n    Therefore, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must be a divisor of $4$. Possible values are $1, 2, 4$.\n\n2.  Reduction modulo $p=5$:\n    The curve equation becomes $E_5 \\colon y^2 \\equiv x^3 - 2x + 2 \\pmod 5$, which is $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + 3x + 2 \\pmod 5$. We count the points for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{F}_5 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The quadratic residues in $\\mathbb{F}_5$ are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 4^2 \\equiv 1$, and $2^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 4$.\n    Let's evaluate $f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 2$ for each $x$:\n    -   If $x=0$, $f(0) = 2$. Not a quadratic residue.\n    -   If $x=1$, $f(1) = 1+3+2 = 6 \\equiv 1$. $y^2=1 \\implies y=1, 4$. Points: $(1,1), (1,4)$.\n    -   If $x=2$, $f(2) = 8+6+2 = 16 \\equiv 1$. $y^2=1 \\implies y=1, 4$. Points: $(2,1), (2,4)$.\n    -   If $x=3$, $f(3) = 27+9+2 = 38 \\equiv 3$. Not a quadratic residue.\n    -   If $x=4$, $f(4) = 64+12+2 = 78 \\equiv 3$. Not a quadratic residue.\n    The finite points on $E(\\mathbb{F}_5)$ are $(1,1), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4)$. Including $\\mathcal{O}$, the total number of points is $|E(\\mathbb{F}_5)| = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    Therefore, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must be a divisor of $5$. Possible values are $1, 5$.\n\nCombining the results, $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}|$ must divide both $4$ and $5$. The greatest common divisor is $\\text{gcd}(4,5) = 1$. This implies that $|E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}| = 1$. The only torsion point is the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nTo be thorough and as requested by the prompt, we also apply the Lutz–Nagell theorem. The theorem has two parts for a point $P=(x,y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}}$ on the curve $y^2 = x^3+Ax+B$ with $A,B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n(i) The coordinates $x, y$ must be integers.\n(ii) Either $y=0$ (the point has order $2$) or $y^2$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta$.\n\nFor our curve $E \\colon y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2$, we have $A=-2$ and $B=2$. We search for integer points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the conditions.\n\nCase 1: $y=0$.\nThe equation becomes $x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any integer root $x$ must divide the constant term $2$. The possible integer roots are $x \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$.\n-   $f(1) = 1-2+2=1 \\neq 0$\n-   $f(-1) = -1+2+2=3 \\neq 0$\n-   $f(2) = 8-4+2=6 \\neq 0$\n-   $f(-2) = -8+4+2=-2 \\neq 0$\nThere are no integer solutions for $x$. Thus, there are no torsion points of order $2$.\n\nCase 2: $y \\neq 0$.\nThe coordinate $y$ must be an integer, and $y^2$ must divide $\\Delta = -1216$. Since $y$ is an integer, $y^2$ must be a positive integer square that divides $1216$. The prime factorization of $1216$ is $2^6 \\times 19$. The square divisors of $1216$ are $1, 4, 16, 64$. We test each case:\n-   Subcase 2a: $y^2=1$, so $y=\\pm 1$. The curve equation becomes $1 = x^3 - 2x + 2$, which simplifies to $x^3 - 2x + 1 = 0$. We check for integer roots. Notice that $x=1$ is a root: $1^3-2(1)+1=0$. We can factor this polynomial as $(x-1)(x^2+x-1) = 0$. The roots of $x^2+x-1=0$ are $x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$, which are not integers. So the only integer solution is $x=1$. This gives two potential torsion points: $P=(1,1)$ and $-P=(1,-1)$.\n-   Subcase 2b: $y^2=4$, so $y=\\pm 2$. The curve equation becomes $4 = x^3 - 2x + 2$, which simplifies to $x^3 - 2x - 2 = 0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, integer roots must divide $-2$: $x \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$.\n    -   $g(1) = 1-2-2=-3 \\neq 0$\n    -   $g(-1) = -1+2-2=-1 \\neq 0$\n    -   $g(2) = 8-4-2=2 \\neq 0$\n    -   $g(-2) = -8+4-2=-6 \\neq 0$\n    There are no integer solutions.\n-   Subcase 2c: $y^2=16$, so $y=\\pm 4$. The equation is $16 = x^3 - 2x + 2$, so $x^3-2x-14=0$. Integer roots must divide 14. Testing $x \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14\\}$ shows no roots.\n-   Subcase 2d: $y^2=64$, so $y=\\pm 8$. The equation is $64 = x^3 - 2x + 2$, so $x^3-2x-62=0$. Integer roots must divide 62. Testing $x \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 31, \\pm 62\\}$ shows no roots.\n\nThe Lutz–Nagell test shows that the only possible non-identity torsion points are $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$. To determine if they are indeed torsion points, we must check if their multiples have integer coordinates. Let's compute $2P$ for $P=(1,1)$. The formula for the slope of the tangent line at $(x_1, y_1)$ is $m = \\frac{3x_1^2+a}{2y_1}$.\n$$\nm = \\frac{3(1)^2 - 2}{2(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe x-coordinate of the doubled point $2P=(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $x_2 = m^2-2x_1$.\n$$\nx_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - 2(1) = \\frac{1}{4} - 2 = -\\frac{7}{4}\n$$\nThe x-coordinate of $2P$ is not an integer. According to the first part of the Lutz-Nagell theorem, any finite torsion point must have integer coordinates. Since $x(2P)$ is not an integer, $2P$ cannot be a finite torsion point (it is also not the point at infinity). This implies that $P=(1,1)$ cannot be a torsion point, as the set of torsion points forms a group, and any multiple of a torsion point must also be a torsion point. Similarly, $-P=(1,-1)$ cannot be a torsion point.\n\nBoth methods of analysis—bounding the group order via reduction modulo primes and direct search via the Lutz-Nagell theorem—consistently lead to the conclusion that there are no finite torsion points on the curve $E$. The only torsion point is the identity element, the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$.\nTherefore, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group, $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\mathrm{tors}} = \\{\\mathcal{O}\\}$.

Thus, $p=5$ and $p=7$ are primes of good reduction for $E$.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$.**\nFor the prime $p=5$, the elliptic curve $E$ reduces to the curve $\\widetilde{E}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{5}$ with the equation:\n$$ y^{2} \\equiv x^{3}-2 \\pmod{5} \\implies y^{2} \\equiv x^{3}+3 \\pmod{5} $$\nThe point $P=(3,5)$ reduces to $\\widetilde{P} = (3 \\pmod{5}, 5 \\pmod{5}) = (3,0)$.\nTo verify $\\widetilde{P}$ is on $\\widetilde{E}$, we check its coordinates: $0^{2} \\equiv 3^{3}+3 \\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $0 \\equiv 27+3 \\equiv 30 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.

There are $6$ such points. Including the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, the group $E(\\mathbb{F}_{7})$ has $|E(\\mathbb{F}_{7})| = 6+1=7$ points.\nSince the order of the group $|E(\\mathbb{F}_{7})|=7$ is a prime number, the group is cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$. Any element other than the identity $\\mathcal{O}$ must be a generator and have order $7$. Our point $\\widetilde{P}=(3,5)$ is not the point at infinity. Therefore, its order is $o_{7}=7$.\n\n**Step 4: Orders of Torsion Points under Reduction.**\nLet $P \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$ be a torsion point of order $N$. The reduction map $\\rho_{p}: E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\rightarrow E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})$ for a prime $p$ of good reduction is a group homomorphism. This means $\\rho_{p}(Q_{1}+Q_{2}) = \\rho_{p}(Q_{1})+\\rho_{p}(Q_{2})$.\nIf $P$ has order $N$, then $NP = \\mathcal{O}$. Applying the homomorphism:\n$$ \\rho_{p}(NP) = \\rho_{p}(\\mathcal{O}) \\implies N \\cdot \\rho_{p}(P) = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} \\implies N\\widetilde{P} = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} $$\nThis shows that the order of $\\widetilde{P}$, $o_{p}$, must divide $N$.\nFurthermore, for any prime $p$ of good reduction, the reduction map restricted to the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ is injective. This is a standard result, often stated for primes $p$ not dividing $2\\Delta$, which holds for $p=5$ and $p=7$.\nLet $o_{p}$ be the order of $\\widetilde{P}$. Then $o_{p}\\widetilde{P} = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}$. By the homomorphism property, this is $\\rho_{p}(o_{p}P) = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} = \\rho_{p}(\\mathcal{O})$.\nSince the map is injective on torsion points, this implies $o_{p}P = \\mathcal{O}$.\nAs $N$ is the order of $P$ (the smallest positive integer such that $NP=\\mathcal{O}$), it must be that $N$ divides $o_{p}$.\nSince we have both $o_{p} | N$ and $N | o_{p}$, and both are positive integers, it must be that $o_{p} = N$. Thus, for a prime of good reduction where the reduction map is injective on torsion, the order of a torsion point is preserved.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation and conclusion about $P$.**\nWe are asked to compute $G=\\gcd(o_{5},o_{7})$. From our previous computations, $o_{5}=2$ and $o_{7}=7$.\n$$ G = \\gcd(2, 7) = 1 $$\nIf the point $P=(3,5)$ were a torsion point in $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ of order $N$, then according to the reasoning in Step 4, its order $N$ would be preserved under reduction for $p=5$ and $p=7$. This would imply $N=o_{5}=2$ and $N=o_{7}=7$. This is a contradiction, as $2 \\neq 7$.\nTherefore, the initial assumption that $P$ is a torsion point must be false. We conclude that $P=(3,5)$ is a point of infinite order.\n\n**Step 6: Comparison with the Nagell-Lutz theorem.**\nThe Nagell-Lutz theorem provides necessary conditions for a rational point on an elliptic curve with integer coefficients to be a torsion point. For $E: y^{2}=x^{3}+Ax+B$ with $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n1. A torsion point $P=(x,y) \\neq \\mathcal{O}$ must have integer coordinates, $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. The $y$-coordinate must satisfy either $y=0$ (for points of order $2$) or $y^{2}$ divides the discriminant $\\Delta$.\n\nOur point is $P=(3,5)$. The coordinates $x=3$ and $y=5$ are integers, so condition 1 is met.\nThe $y$-coordinate is $y=5 \\neq 0$. We must check if $y^{2}$ divides $\\Delta$.\nWe have $y^{2}=5^{2}=25$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = -1728$.\nThe prime factorization of $y^{2}$ is $5^{2}$. The prime factorization of $\\Delta$ is $-2^{6} \\cdot 3^{3}$. Since the prime $5$ does not appear in the factorization of $\\Delta$, $25$ cannot divide $-1728$.\nThe second condition of the Nagell-Lutz theorem is violated. Therefore, $P=(3,5)$ cannot be a torsion point. This conclusion is consistent with the one reached using reduction modulo primes.\n\nThe specific value requested for the final answer is $G$.\n$G = \\gcd(o_{5}, o_{7}) = \\gcd(2, 7) = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3028539"}, {"introduction": "The hypotheses of a theorem are just as important as its conclusion.

Two Weierstrass equations related by a rational change of variables of the form\n$$\nx = u^{2} x' + r, \\quad y = u^{3} y' + s u^{2} x' + t\n$$\nwith $u, r, s, t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $u \\neq 0$, define isomorphic elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$; in particular, they induce a group isomorphism on rational points preserving torsion orders.\n\nStep 1: Derive the equation for $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ and verify torsion on $E_{\\min}$.\nThe minimal model is given by\n$$\nE_{\\min}:\\quad Y^{2} = X^{3} - X\n$$\nThe change of variables is $X = 4x$ and $Y = 8y$. Substituting these into the equation for $E_{\\min}$ yields\n$$\n(8y)^{2} = (4x)^{3} - (4x) \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 64 y^{2} = 64 x^{3} - 4x \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad y^{2} = x^{3} - \\frac{1}{16} x.\n$$\nHence the scaled model is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{sc}}:\\quad y^{2} = x^{3} - \\frac{1}{16} x.\n$$\nNote that $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is not an integral model because its coefficient $-\\frac{1}{16}$ is not an integer.\n\nThe point on the minimal model is $P_{\\min} = (1, 0)$ (i.e., $(X,Y)=(1,0)$). Substituting into the equation for $E_{\\min}$ gives $0^2 = 1^3 - 1 = 0$, so $P_{\\min} \\in E_{\\min}(\\mathbb{Q})$. For a point on a short Weierstrass curve, if its $y$-coordinate is $0$, it is a $2$-torsion point. This is because reflection across the $X$-axis, which defines the group inverse, fixes the point, so $P_{\\min} = -P_{\\min}$ and thus $2P_{\\min} = \\mathcal{O}$. Thus $P_{\\min}$ is a point of order $2$ and is torsion.\n\nStep 2: Transport $P_{\\min}$ to the scaled model $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ and compute its coordinates.\nThe isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}$ from $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ to $E_{\\min}$ sends $(x, y) \\mapsto (X, Y) = (4x, 8y)$. Therefore, the inverse map sends a point $(X, Y) \\in E_{\\min}(\\mathbb{Q})$ to $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{X}{4}, \\frac{Y}{8}\\right) \\in E_{\\mathrm{sc}}(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nApplying this to $P_{\\min}$ with coordinates $(X,Y)=(1,0)$ gives the corresponding point $P_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ on $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{sc}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{0}{8}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0\\right).\n$$\nThe coordinates are $(x,y) = (1/4, 0)$. In lowest terms, the $x$-coordinate has denominator $4$.\n\nStep 3: Explain disappearance of denominators under minimalization and the role of the Nagell–Lutz theorem.\nThe two models $E_{\\min}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ are isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The point $P_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is a torsion point because torsion is preserved under isomorphism. However, the Nagell–Lutz theorem, which asserts that torsion points have integer coordinates, applies only to integral Weierstrass models. The model $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ is not an integral model, so there is no guarantee that its torsion points will have integral coordinates. Indeed, we found that $x(P_{\\mathrm{sc}}) = \\frac{1}{4}$ has a nontrivial denominator.\n\nThe model $E_{\\min}: Y^2=X^3-X$ is an integral (and minimal) model. The Nagell-Lutz theorem applies to it, and correctly predicts that its torsion point $P_{\\min}=(1,0)$ has integer coordinates. The transformation from the non-integral model $E_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ back to the integral model $E_{\\min}$ is given by $(x, y) \\mapsto (X, Y) = (4x, 8y)$. This transformation clears the denominators present in the coordinates of $P_{\\mathrm{sc}}$, producing the integral coordinates of $P_{\\min}$. This illustrates why the hypothesis of an integral model is essential for the Nagell-Lutz theorem's conclusion about integer coordinates.\n\nThe least common denominator of the $x$-coordinate of $P_{\\mathrm{sc}}$ in lowest terms is therefore $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "3028533"}]}
