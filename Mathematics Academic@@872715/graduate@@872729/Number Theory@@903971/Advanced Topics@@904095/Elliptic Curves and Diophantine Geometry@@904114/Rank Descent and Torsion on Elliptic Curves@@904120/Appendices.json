The problem asks for three things: a justification of the minimality of this model at all primes, the computation and factorization of its discriminant $\\Delta$, and the set of primes of bad reduction.\n\nAn elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be represented by many different integral Weierstrass models, all of which are isomorphic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A model is said to be minimal at a prime $p$ if the $p$-adic valuation of its discriminant, denoted $v_p(\\Delta)$, is the minimum possible among all integral models isomorphic to $E$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The set of primes of bad reduction for $E$ is the set of prime divisors of the minimal discriminant.\n\nWe begin by establishing a criterion for minimality based on first principles, as requested. Any two Weierstrass models for $E$ are related by an admissible change of variables:\n$$\nx = u^{2}x' + r, \\quad y = u^{3}y' + su^{2}x' + t\n$$\nwhere $u, r, s, t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $u \\neq 0$. The discriminant of the new model, $\\Delta'$, is related to the discriminant of the original model, $\\Delta$, by the formula $\\Delta' = u^{-12}\\Delta$.\nFor a given model with discriminant $\\Delta$ to be non-minimal at a prime $p$, there must exist another isomorphic integral model with discriminant $\\Delta'$ such that $v_p(\\Delta')  v_p(\\Delta)$. From the transformation formula for the discriminant, this is equivalent to:\n$$\nv_p(u^{-12}\\Delta)  v_p(\\Delta) \\implies -12v_p(u) + v_p(\\Delta)  v_p(\\Delta) \\implies -12v_p(u)  0 \\implies v_p(u)  0\n$$\nSo, a non-minimal model at $p$ can be transformed into a \"more minimal\" one by a change of variables where $u \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ has a positive $p$-adic valuation. Since $v_p(u)$ must be an integer (as $u$ is rational), this means $v_p(u) \\ge 1$.\nFurthermore, for the new model to be an integral model, its discriminant $\\Delta'$ must be an integer. This implies that $v_p(\\Delta') \\ge 0$.\nNow consider the condition $v_p(\\Delta') = v_p(\\Delta) - 12v_p(u)$. If a model is not minimal at $p$, there exists a change of variables with $v_p(u) \\ge 1$ yielding a new integral model. For this new model, we must have $v_p(\\Delta') \\ge 0$, which implies:\n$$\nv_p(\\Delta) - 12v_p(u) \\ge 0 \\implies v_p(\\Delta) \\ge 12v_p(u)\n$$\nSince $v_p(u) \\ge 1$, a necessary condition for a model to be non-minimal at $p$ is $v_p(\\Delta) \\ge 12$. The contrapositive of this statement provides a sufficient condition for minimality: if $v_p(\\Delta)  12$ for a prime $p$, the model must be minimal at $p$. We will use this criterion to justify the minimality of the given model at all primes.\n\nTo apply this criterion, we must first compute the discriminant $\\Delta$ for the given model. The formula for the discriminant of a short Weierstrass equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ is $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$.\nThe given coefficients are $A = -91$ and $B = 140$.

By testing small prime divisors, we find $12679 = 31 \\times 409$. The number $409$ is prime, as can be verified by checking for prime divisors up to $\\sqrt{409} \\approx 20.2$.\nThe final prime factorization of the discriminant is:\n$$\n\\Delta = 2^6 \\times 7^2 \\times 31^1 \\times 409^1\n$$\n\nHaving computed and factored $\\Delta$, we return to the justification of minimality. We check the $p$-adic valuation of $\\Delta$ for each of its prime factors:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $p=2$, $v_2(\\Delta) = 6$. Since $6  12$, the model is minimal at $p=2$.\n    \\item For $p=7$, $v_7(\\Delta) = 2$. Since $2  12$, the model is minimal at $p=7$.\n    \\item For $p=31$, $v_{31}(\\Delta) = 1$. Since $1  12$, the model is minimal at $p=31$.\n    \\item For $p=409$, $v_{409}(\\Delta) = 1$. Since $1  12$, the model is minimal at $p=409$.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor any other prime $p$, $p$ does not divide $\\Delta$, so $v_p(\\Delta) = 0$, which is also less than $12$.\nSince $v_p(\\Delta)  12$ for all primes $p$, we conclude that the given integral Weierstrass model $y^2 = x^3 - 91x + 140$ is minimal at all rational primes.\n\nFinally, we identify the set of rational primes of bad reduction. The problem states this is the set of primes dividing the minimal discriminant of $E$. Since we have established that the discriminant $\\Delta$ of our model is a minimal discriminant, the primes of bad reduction are precisely the prime factors of $\\Delta$.\nFrom the factorization $\\Delta = 2^6 \\times 7^2 \\times 31 \\times 409$, the distinct prime factors are $2$, $7$, $31$, and $409$.\nThe set of primes of bad reduction for $E$ is $\\{2, 7, 31, 409\\}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2  7  31  409\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3022305"}, {"introduction": "The method of descent hinges on translating the search for rational points on an elliptic curve to a search for points on related spaces, known as homogeneous spaces.

Rank Upper Bound ($r_{\\mathrm{upper}}$)\n\nThe problem provides a framework for deriving an upper bound on the rank $r$ of the Mordell-Weil group $E_{n^2}(\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe foundational inequality relating the rank to the $2$-Selmer group $\\mathrm{Sel}_2(E_{n^2})$ is:\n$$r \\leq \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\mathrm{Sel}_2(E_{n^2}) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} E_{n^2}[2](\\mathbb{Q})$$\nwhere $E_{n^2}[2](\\mathbb{Q})$ is the group of rational points of order dividing $2$.\nThe equation for our curve is $y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x = x(x-n)(x+n)$. The points of order $2$ are those with $y$-coordinate $y=0$, which occur at $x \\in \\{0, n, -n\\}$.

Rank Lower Bound ($r_{\\mathrm{lower}}$)\n\nA lower bound for the rank can be established by finding rational points of infinite order. For the family $E_{n^2}$, the torsion subgroup consists only of points with $y$-coordinate $y=0$ (for $n2$). Any rational point with a non-zero $y$-coordinate must be of infinite order. Finding just one such point proves that $r \\ge 1$.\nWe perform a search for integral points $(x,y)$ with $y \\ne 0$. This involves checking, for a range of integers $x$, whether the value $x^3 - n^2 x$ is a perfect square. We need only check integers $x$ for which $x^3 - n^2 x  0$. This occurs for $x \\in (-n, 0) \\cup (n, \\infty)$. We will search for integer $x$ in the ranges $[-n+1, -1]$ and $[n+1, 200]$.\n- If a point is found, we set $r_{\\mathrm{lower}}=1$.\n- If the search is unsuccessful in this range, we set $r_{\\mathrm{lower}}=0$.\n\n### 3. Analytic Rank ($r_{\\mathrm{analytic}}$)\n\nThe Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture states that the rank $r$ of an elliptic curve equals the order of vanishing of its Hasse-Weil $L$-function, $L(E, s)$, at the central point $s=1$. We will numerically approximate $L(E_{n^2}, s)$ to heuristically determine if its value at $s=1$ is zero, and if so, whether the zero is of first order. This gives a conjectured analytic rank, $r_{\\mathrm{analytic}} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Bad Primes**: The primes of bad reduction for $E_{n^2}: y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x$ are the primes dividing the discriminant $\\Delta = 2^8 n^6$. These are precisely the prime factors of $2n$.\n2.  **Compute $a_p$ Coefficients**: For each prime $p$ of good reduction, we calculate the coefficient $a_p$ of the $L$-function, defined by $a_p = p + 1 - \\#E_{n^2}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. The size of the point group over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, $\\#E_{n^2}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, is given by $1 + \\sum_{x=0}^{p-1} (1 + (\\frac{x^3 - n^2 x}{p}))$, where $(\\frac{\\cdot}{p})$ is the Legendre symbol. This leads to the formula:\n    $$a_p = -\\sum_{x=0}^{p-1} \\left(\\frac{x^3 - n^2 x}{p}\\right)$$\n3.  **Compute $a_m$ Coefficients**: The coefficients $a_m$ are multiplicative for coprime arguments. For prime powers, they obey the Hecke recurrence relation:\n    $$a_{p^k} = a_p a_{p^{k-1}} - p a_{p^{k-2}} \\quad (k \\ge 2)$$\n    with initial conditions $a_{p^0} = a_1 = 1$ and $a_{p^1} = a_p$. For a general integer $m = p_1^{k_1} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, we have $a_m = a_{p_1^{k_1}} \\cdots a_{p_r^{k_r}}$. We implement a sieve-like method to compute $a_m$ for all $m \\le N$ such that $\\gcd(m, 2n) = 1$.\n4.  **Evaluate Truncated $L$-series**: We approximate $L(E_{n^2}, s)$ using the smoothed, truncated Dirichlet series:\n    $$S_N(s) = \\sum_{\\substack{1 \\leq m \\leq N \\\\ \\gcd(m,2n)=1}} \\frac{a_m}{m^s} e^{-m/N}$$\n    We choose a cutoff $N=10000$ and a small parameter $\\varepsilon=10^{-5}$. We evaluate the sum at three points near the center: $s=1-\\varepsilon$, $s=1$, and $s=1+\\varepsilon$.\n5.  **Determine Analytic Rank**:\n    -   If $|S_N(1)|$ is close to zero (e.g., $ 10^{-3}$), and the values $S_N(1-\\varepsilon)$ and $S_N(1+\\varepsilon)$ have opposite signs and are significantly different from zero, we have numerical evidence for a simple zero. In this case, we conjecture $r_{\\mathrm{analytic}}=1$.\n    -   Otherwise, we assume the $L$-function does not vanish at $s=1$ and conjecture $r_{\\mathrm{analytic}}=0$.\n\n### 4. Final Rank Conjecture ($r_{\\mathrm{conj}}$)\n\nFinally, we synthesize the information from the three methods using the specified formula:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{conj}} = \\min(r_{\\mathrm{upper}}, \\max(r_{\\mathrm{lower}}, r_{\\mathrm{analytic}}))$$\nThis provides a robust conjecture by ensuring the rank does not exceed the rigorous upper bound, while allowing numerical evidence (either from finding a point or from the $L$-function) to suggest a positive rank.
