We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe elliptic curve $E$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the short Weierstrass equation $E: y^{2} = x^{3} - 4x$. This equation is of the form $y^{2} = x^{3} + Ax + B$ with integer coefficients $A = -4$ and $B = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the curve is nonsingular by calculating its discriminant, $\\Delta$. The formula for the discriminant is $\\Delta = -16(4A^{3} + 27B^{2})$.\nSubstituting $A = -4$ and $B = 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta = -16(4(-4)^{3} + 27(0)^{2}) = -16(4(-64)) = -16(-256) = 4096\n$$\nSince $\\Delta = 4096 \\neq 0$, the curve is nonsingular and is indeed an elliptic curve.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the torsion subgroup $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$, which consists of all rational points on $E$ of finite order. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that $E(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a finitely generated abelian group, so it has the structure $E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{r} \\oplus E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$, where $r$ is the rank and $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ is the finite torsion subgroup.\n\nTo find the torsion points, we use the Lutz-Nagell theorem. Since the coefficients $A = -4$ and $B = 0$ are integers, the theorem states that any non-identity torsion point $T = (x, y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$ must have integer coordinates, i.e., $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, it requires that either $y = 0$ or $y^{2}$ must divide the discriminant $\\Delta = 4096$.\n\nWe examine these two cases to find all possible integer points on the curve.\n\nCase 1: $y = 0$.\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the curve equation gives:\n$$\n0 = x^{3} - 4x = x(x^{2} - 4) = x(x - 2)(x + 2)\n$$\nThe integer solutions for $x$ are $x = 0$, $x = 2$, and $x = -2$. This gives us three points with integer coordinates:\n$T_1 = (0, 0)$, $T_2 = (2, 0)$, and $T_3 = (-2, 0)$.\nIn the group law for elliptic curves, points with a $y$-coordinate of $0$ are points of order $2$, because for such a point $P=(x,0)$, its inverse is $-P=(x,-0)=(x,0)=P$. Thus $2P = P+P = \\mathcal{O}$ (the point at infinity). Points of finite order are, by definition, torsion points. Therefore, $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, and $(-2,0)$ are all members of $E(\\mathbb{Q})_{\\text{tors}}$.\n\nCase 2: $y \\neq 0$.\nAccording to the Lutz-Nagell theorem, $y$ must be an integer and $y^{2}$ must divide $\\Delta = 4096$. We know that $4096 = 2^{12}$. For $y^{2}$ to be a perfect square that divides $2^{12}$, $y^{2}$ must be an even power of $2$.\nThe possible values for $y^{2}$ are:\n$y^{2} \\in \\{2^{0}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{6}, 2^{8}, 2^{10}, 2^{12}\\} = \\{1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096\\}$.\n\nWe now test each of these possibilities by substituting them into the curve equation $x^{3} - 4x = y^{2}$ and checking for integer solutions for $x$.\nLet $f(x) = x^{3} - 4x$.\n- If $y^{2} = 1$: $x^{3} - 4x - 1 = 0$.

No integer solutions.\n- If $y^{2} = 16$: $x^{3} - 4x - 16 = 0$. Integer roots must divide $-16$.\n  - For $x > 2$, $f(x)$ is increasing. $f(2)=0$, $f(3)=15$, $f(4)=48$. There is no integer $x$ for which $f(x) = 16$.\n- If $y^{2} = 64$: $x^{3} - 4x - 64 = 0$.\n  - $f(4) = 48$, $f(5) = 105$. No integer $x$ for which $f(x) = 64$.\n- If $y^{2} = 256$: $x^{3} - 4x - 256 = 0$.\n  - $f(6) = 192$, $f(7) = 315$.

No integer $x$ for which $f(x) = 4096$.\n\nWe have exhausted all possibilities under the Lutz-Nagell theorem. The only integer points on the curve are $(0, 0)$, $(2, 0)$, and $(-2, 0)$.
