## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The Diagonal Lemma, whose proof was detailed in the preceding chapter, is far more than a technical curiosity. It is the fundamental mechanism that enables a sufficiently rich [formal language](@entry_id:153638) to construct sentences that refer to their own properties. This capacity for formal self-reference is not a peripheral feature; it is the engine driving some of the most profound and impactful results in mathematical logic, with far-reaching consequences for mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. This chapter will explore the principal applications of the Diagonal Lemma, demonstrating how this single result serves as the cornerstone for the limitative theorems of Gödel and Tarski, and how it provides a deep connection between arithmetic, [computability](@entry_id:276011), and [modal logic](@entry_id:149086).

### The Limitative Theorems: Gödel and Tarski

The most immediate and celebrated applications of the Diagonal Lemma lie in establishing the inherent limitations of formal axiomatic systems. By constructing sentences that assert their own metamathematical properties, one can expose the gap between truth and [provability](@entry_id:149169).

#### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems

The First Incompleteness Theorem, a landmark of 20th-century thought, is a direct consequence of the Diagonal Lemma. Consider a consistent, recursively axiomatized theory $T$ that is strong enough to represent all [computable functions](@entry_id:152169), such as Peano Arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$). Within such a theory, we can define a formula $\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ that represents the predicate "$x$ is the Gödel number of a theorem of $T$". This formula is of complexity $\Sigma^{0}_{1}$ in the [arithmetical hierarchy](@entry_id:155689).

To construct the Gödel sentence for $T$, we apply the Diagonal Lemma to the formula $\psi(x) \equiv \neg \mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$. The lemma guarantees the existence of a sentence $G$ such that $T \vdash G \leftrightarrow \neg \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner G \urcorner)$. This sentence $G$ is a formal statement that asserts its own unprovability.

From this fixed point, the first part of the incompleteness theorem follows from the mere assumption of $T$'s consistency. If $T$ were to prove $G$, then by the properties of the [provability predicate](@entry_id:634685), $T$ would also prove $\mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner G \urcorner)$. However, from the definition of $G$, its provability in $T$ also implies the provability of $\neg \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner G \urcorner)$. A theory that proves both a statement and its negation is inconsistent. Therefore, by contraposition, if $T$ is consistent, it cannot prove $G$. Furthermore, if the axioms of $T$ are true in the standard model of arithmetic $\mathbb{N}$, then this unprovable sentence $G$ is, in fact, *true*. Since $G$ is not provable in $T$, the statement $\mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner G \urcorner)$ is false in $\mathbb{N}$, which means $\neg \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner G \urcorner)$ is true in $\mathbb{N}$. By the defining equivalence of $G$, it follows that $G$ itself must be true in $\mathbb{N}$.

The Diagonal Lemma thus provides an explicit construction of a true but unprovable sentence, demonstrating the incompleteness of any such theory $T$. To establish that the negation of $G$, $\neg G$, is also unprovable, a stronger assumption, such as the $\omega$-consistency of $T$, is required. The unprovability of both $G$ and $\neg G$ (under appropriate consistency assumptions) reveals that $G$ is an undecidable statement within the theory $T$ [@problem_id:2974915] [@problem_id:2984046] [@problem_id:2985909].

#### Tarski's Undefinability of Truth

While Gödel's theorem reveals a gap between truth and provability, Tarski's theorem, another direct application of the Diagonal Lemma, goes deeper to question the very expressibility of truth. Tarski asked whether the set of all true sentences of a language can be defined *within that same language*. A language capable of defining its own truth predicate is called "semantically closed".

Suppose for a language like that of arithmetic, $\mathcal{L}_A$, there were a formula $Tr(x)$ that defined truth in the standard model $\mathbb{N}$. This would mean that for every sentence $\varphi$ of $\mathcal{L}_A$, the Tarski [biconditional](@entry_id:264837) $\mathbb{N} \models Tr(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner) \leftrightarrow \varphi$ would hold. The Diagonal Lemma demolishes this possibility with elegant finality. Applying the lemma to the formula $\neg Tr(x)$ yields a "Liar sentence" $\lambda$ such that $\mathbb{N} \models \lambda \leftrightarrow \neg Tr(\ulcorner \lambda \urcorner)$. This sentence asserts its own falsehood.

When we instantiate the Tarski [biconditional](@entry_id:264837) for the sentence $\lambda$ itself, we get $\mathbb{N} \models Tr(\ulcorner \lambda \urcorner) \leftrightarrow \lambda$. Combining these two equivalences leads to the outright contradiction $\mathbb{N} \models \lambda \leftrightarrow \neg \lambda$. The conclusion is inescapable: no sufficiently expressive [formal language](@entry_id:153638) can be semantically closed. This establishes a fundamental constraint on [formal systems](@entry_id:634057), showing that the concept of truth for a system necessarily transcends the expressive power of the system itself [@problem_id:2983813] [@problem_id:2984063] [@problem_id:2984042].

This powerful result clarifies the required conditions for such a limitation: any language that admits an effective coding of its own syntax and in which the necessary syntactic functions are representable will be subject to this theorem. This highlights that the Diagonal Lemma is the crucial ingredient enabling the [self-reference](@entry_id:153268) that leads to paradox [@problem_id:2984080]. Tarski's theorem, in turn, guides the design of consistent, "safe" theories of truth. Since a global truth predicate is impossible, logicians have developed partial truth predicates, such as one for the class of bounded arithmetic formulas ($\Delta_0$), or stratified hierarchies of truth predicates ($T_0, T_1, \dots$), where each predicate $T_{n+1}$ can only speak of the truth of sentences that use predicates up to level $n$. In each case, the liar construction is circumvented because the paradoxical sentence falls outside the restricted domain of the truth predicate in question [@problem_id:2984048].

### Generalizations and Connections to Modal Logic

The self-referential technique of the Diagonal Lemma is not limited to producing negative or undecidable results. It is also a tool for proving deep structural theorems about provability itself, creating a bridge to the abstract study of [modal logic](@entry_id:149086).

#### Löb's Theorem and the Henkin Sentence

A natural question arises: what happens if we apply the Diagonal Lemma not to the predicate of unprovability, but to the predicate of provability itself? Applying the lemma to $\psi(x) \equiv \mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ yields a "Henkin sentence" $\theta$ such that $T \vdash \theta \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \theta \urcorner)$. This sentence asserts its own provability.

Unlike the Gödel sentence, the Henkin sentence is provable in $T$. This remarkable fact is a consequence of Löb's Theorem, which itself relies on a clever application of the Diagonal Lemma. Löb's theorem states that for any sentence $\varphi$, if $T \vdash \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner) \to \varphi$, then $T \vdash \varphi$. In other words, the only way a theory can prove that a sentence follows from its own [provability](@entry_id:149169) is if the theory already proves the sentence outright. The proof of this theorem involves constructing a fixed point $\psi$ for the formula $\mathrm{Prov}_T(y) \to \varphi$. A chain of reasoning using the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions then forces the conclusion that $T \vdash \varphi$ [@problem_id:2980184]. The Henkin sentence $\theta$ is a special case: its defining equivalence $T \vdash \theta \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \theta \urcorner)$ directly implies $T \vdash \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \theta \urcorner) \to \theta$, thereby satisfying the premise of Löb's theorem and yielding the conclusion $T \vdash \theta$ [@problem_id:2971596].

Löb's theorem also provides a streamlined proof of Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem. Let $\bot$ represent a contradiction. The consistency of $T$, $\mathrm{Con}(T)$, is the statement $\neg \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \bot \urcorner)$. Gödel's Second Theorem is the statement that if $T$ is consistent, then $T \not\vdash \mathrm{Con}(T)$. If $T$ were to prove $\mathrm{Con}(T)$, it would prove $\neg \mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \bot \urcorner)$, which is equivalent to $\mathrm{Prov}_T(\ulcorner \bot \urcorner) \to \bot$. By Löb's theorem (with $\varphi = \bot$), this would imply $T \vdash \bot$, meaning $T$ is inconsistent.

#### Provability Logic

The rich, law-like behavior of the [provability predicate](@entry_id:634685) $\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ invites an abstract, algebraic treatment. This is the domain of [provability logic](@entry_id:149023), an interdisciplinary field connecting [mathematical logic](@entry_id:140746) with [modal logic](@entry_id:149086). In this context, the modal operator $\Box$ is interpreted as arithmetical provability. The axioms and rules of the [modal logic](@entry_id:149086) system GL (Gödel-Löb) are designed to capture the behavior of $\mathrm{Prov}_{\mathsf{PA}}$.

The Diagonal Lemma is once again of central importance, particularly in the proof of Solovay's [arithmetical completeness](@entry_id:152822) theorems, which show that GL is indeed the logic of [provability](@entry_id:149169) in $\mathsf{PA}$. To prove this, one must construct, for any given finite Kripke model of GL, an "arithmetical realization" that mirrors its structure. This is achieved by assigning to each world $w$ in the Kripke frame an arithmetical sentence $S_w$. The crucial step is to ensure that these sentences interact via provability in a way that mimics the frame's [accessibility relation](@entry_id:149013). For example, a sentence $S_w$ might need to assert that if it is provable, then one of the sentences $S_v$ for a successor world $v$ must also be provable.

This complex, interdependent self-reference is made possible by the *simultaneous* version of the Diagonal Lemma. This powerful generalization allows the construction of multiple sentences $\psi_1, \dots, \psi_n$ that are simultaneous fixed points of formulas that refer to each other's Gödel numbers. This ensures that the entire modal frame can be encoded as a system of arithmetical sentences, a testament to the profound constructive power of the Diagonal Lemma [@problem_id:2980182] [@problem_id:2980163].

### Self-Reference and Nonstandard Models

Finally, the sentences constructed via the Diagonal Lemma provide a powerful lens through which to examine the structure of [nonstandard models of arithmetic](@entry_id:636869). These are models of $\mathsf{PA}$ that contain "infinite" numbers in addition to the standard [natural numbers](@entry_id:636016).

The Gödel sentence $G$ is true in the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ but can be false in a nonstandard model $M$. Since $M \models \neg G$, and $G$ is equivalent to its own unprovability, it follows that $M \models \mathrm{Prov}_{\mathsf{PA}}(\ulcorner G \urcorner)$. This means that within $M$, there exists an element $c$ that $M$ considers to be the Gödel code of a proof of $G$. Since no such proof exists among the standard [natural numbers](@entry_id:636016), this "proof code" $c$ must be a nonstandard element. The existence of such nonstandard witnesses for $\Sigma^{0}_{1}$ formulas is a key feature distinguishing nonstandard models from $\mathbb{N}$ [@problem_id:2974915] [@problem_id:2985909].

This interplay also helps clarify the scope of Tarski's theorem. Advanced model-theoretic results show that certain nonstandard models of $\mathsf{PA}$ can be expanded to a structure $\langle M, S \rangle$ that contains a "satisfaction class" $S$. This class $S$ acts as a full truth predicate for all sentences of arithmetic relative to the model $M$. This does not contradict Tarski's theorem, because the set $S$ is not definable by a formula in the original language of arithmetic. It is an external set added by expanding the language, thereby reinforcing Tarski's point: truth cannot be defined from *within*, using only the resources of the language itself [@problem_id:2984071]. The Diagonal Lemma forces a distinction between what is true and what is definable, a distinction that echoes through all of formal logic.
