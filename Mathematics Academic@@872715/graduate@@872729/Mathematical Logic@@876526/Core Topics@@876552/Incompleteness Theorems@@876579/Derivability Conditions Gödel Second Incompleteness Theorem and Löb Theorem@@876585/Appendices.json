This hinges on the correct arithmetization of the predicate $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$, which stands for \"$y$ is the code of a $T$-proof of the formula with Gödel number $x$\".\n\nA formal proof in a Hilbert-style system is a finite sequence of formulas where each formula is either an axiom or is derived from previous formulas by rules of inference (in this case, modus ponens). A formula $\\varphi$ is considered proven by such a sequence if and only if $\\varphi$ is the **last** formula in the sequence.\n\nThe definition of $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ is standardly given by $\\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$. According to the arithmetical hierarchy, for $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ to be a $\\Sigma_1$ formula, its matrix, $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$, must be a $\\Delta_0$ formula (a formula where all quantifiers are bounded).\n\nThe formula $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$ must assert two conditions:\n1.  $y$ encodes a valid $T$-proof. This is given by the predicate $\\mathrm{Prf}_T(y)$. The problem states that $\\mathrm{Prf}_T(y)$ is a primitive recursive predicate. A fundamental theorem of computability theory, provable in weak arithmetic such as $I\\Sigma_1$, states that every primitive recursive predicate is definable by a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n2.  The formula with Gödel number $x$ is the conclusion of the proof encoded by $y$. As established, this means $x$ must be the Gödel number of the last formula in the sequence encoded by $y$.\n\nLet us construct the formula for the second condition. The problem provides a standard Gödel coding apparatus for finite sequences with primitive recursive functions $\\mathrm{len}(y)$ and $\\mathrm{entry}(y,i)$, whose graphs are definable by $\\Delta_0$ formulas. A sequence is non-empty if its length is greater than $0$. The indices of a sequence of length $L$ run from $0$ to $L-1$. Therefore, the last entry is at index $\\mathrm{len}(y)-1$.\nThe assertion \"$p$ is the last line of the proof coded by $y$\" is formalized as: \"$y$ codes a non-empty sequence of formulas, and $p$ is the entry at index $\\mathrm{len}(y)-1$\".\nIn formal notation, this is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Last}(y,p) \\equiv \\mathrm{Seq}(y) \\land \\mathrm{len}(y) > 0 \\land p = \\mathrm{entry}(y, \\mathrm{len}(y)-1) $$\nHere, $\\mathrm{Seq}(y)$ is a predicate (assumed $\\Delta_0$) checking if $y$ is a valid code for a sequence. The relations $l = \\mathrm{len}(y)$ and $e = \\mathrm{entry}(y,i)$ are $\\Delta_0$. Basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, like $k = l-1$ and $l>0$, are also $\\Delta_0$. Since all components and operations are $\\Delta_0$, the composite formula $\\mathrm{Last}(y,p)$ is a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n\nNow, we can define $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$ as the conjunction of the two conditions:\n$$ \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x) \\equiv \\mathrm{Prf}_T(y) \\land \\mathrm{Last}(y,x) $$\nSince both $\\mathrm{Prf}_T(y)$ and $\\mathrm{Last}(y,x)$ are $\\Delta_0$ formulas, their conjunction, $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$, is also a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n\nFinally, the provability predicate is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Prov}_T(x) \\equiv \\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x) $$\nThis is an existential quantification of a $\\Delta_0$ formula, which by definition is a $\\Sigma_1$ formula. This standard construction is precisely what is needed to prove the Hilbert-Bernays-Löb derivability conditions, particularly the third condition, $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\to \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$, whose proof relies on the $\\Sigma_1$-completeness property for the $\\Sigma_1$ formula $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this derivation.\n\n**A.

This structure is essential for proving the derivability conditions.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Define the “last line” relation by... the maximum Gödel number...**\nThis option proposes defining the last line as the formula with the maximum Gödel number in the proof. This is conceptually incorrect. The conclusion of a proof is determined by its position in the deductive sequence, not the numerical value of its code. This option also proposes defining $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x) \\equiv \\mathrm{Prf}_T(y) \\wedge x \\in y$, which means $x$ simply appears anywhere in the proof. This is also incorrect; a formula appearing in a proof is not necessarily a theorem proven by that proof. It could be an axiom, a hypothesis in a sub-derivation, or an intermediate lemma.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The “last line” property cannot be expressed by a bounded ($\\Delta_0$) formula...**\nThis option claims that formalizing the \"last line\" property requires a $\\Pi_2$ condition. This is false. As demonstrated in the analysis of option A, the property is definable by a $\\Delta_0$ formula. The idea of quantifying over all extensions of the sequence is irrelevant to identifying the last element of a given, fixed sequence $y$. Furthermore, it claims that this higher complexity is necessary for the derivability conditions, which is the opposite of the truth. The standard proofs require $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ to be $\\Sigma_1$. A more complex predicate would invalidate the usual proof of the third derivability condition.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Define the “last line” relation by... $p$ is some line of the proof...**\nThis option defines the relation as $\\exists i<\\mathrm{len}(y)\\,\\big(p=\\mathrm{entry}(y,i)\\big)$, meaning $p$ is any formula appearing in the proof sequence. This is the same conceptual error as in option B. While this would lead to a $\\Sigma_1$ provability predicate, the predicate would not represent the correct notion of theoremhood. A formula being provable means there exists a proof that concludes with it, not a proof that merely contains it. This faulty definition would not satisfy the derivability conditions; for instance, the formalization of modus ponens (D2) would fail.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2971586"}, {"introduction": "Gödel’s theorems rely on assumptions about the consistency of the theory in question, but not all \"consistency\" notions are the same.

Relationship between $\\omega$-consistency and $1$-consistency**\n\n*   **Definition of $\\omega$-consistency:** A theory $T$ is $\\omega$-consistent if for no formula $\\varphi(x)$ with one free variable, it is the case that both $T \\vdash \\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ and, for every natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $T \\vdash \\lnot\\varphi(\\overline{n})$.

Let $\\sigma$ be a $\\Sigma_1$-sentence such that $T \\vdash \\sigma$. We must show that $\\sigma$ is true. Since $\\sigma$ is $\\Sigma_1$, it has the form $\\exists x\\,R(x)$, where $R(x)$ is a formula with only bounded quantifiers (specifically, $R(x)$ can be taken to be a primitive recursive predicate). So we have $T \\vdash \\exists x\\,R(x)$.\n    *   Assume for contradiction that $\\sigma$ is false. This means $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\lnot \\exists x\\,R(x)$, which is equivalent to $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\forall x\\,\\lnot R(x)$.\n    *   For any standard natural number $n$, it holds that $\\mathbb{N} \\models \\lnot R(n)$. Since $R(x)$ is a primitive recursive predicate, the statement $\\lnot R(\\overline{n})$ is a true sentence with no quantifiers (a $\\Pi_0$ sentence). Any theory extending Robinson Arithmetic $Q$ (such as $T$) proves all true $\\Pi_0$ sentences. Thus, for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $T \\vdash \\lnot R(\\overline{n})$.\n    *   We have now established that $T \\vdash \\exists x\\,R(x)$ and for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $T \\vdash \\lnot R(\\overline{n})$. This is precisely the definition of $T$ being $\\omega$-inconsistent, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n    *   Therefore, the assumption that $\\sigma$ is false must be wrong. The sentence $\\sigma$ must be true. This proves that $\\omega$-consistency implies $1$-consistency.\n\n*   **Strictness of Implication:** The converse is not true; $1$-consistency does not imply $\\omega$-consistency. Their existence is a known result in metamathematics. Thus, $\\omega$-consistency is a strictly stronger property than $1$-consistency.\n\n**2. Hypotheses for Incompleteness Theorems**\n\n*   **Gödel's First Theorem (Rosser's Form):** As stated in the problem, Rosser's improvement to Gödel's first theorem shows that for any consistent, recursively axiomatized theory $T$ extending $Q$, there is a sentence (the Rosser sentence) such that $T \\nvdash \\text{Rosser}_T$ and $T \\nvdash \\lnot\\text{Rosser}_T$. The only required hypothesis is **consistency**.\n\n*   **Gödel's Second Theorem:** The theorem states that if $T$ is a consistent theory (satisfying the HBL conditions), then $T \\nvdash \\mathrm{Con}(T)$. The required hypothesis is again **consistency**.\n    However, the full picture of consistency statements involves preventing the theory from proving its own *inconsistency*. That is, under what conditions can we also show $T \\nvdash \\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(T)$?\n    *   The statement of inconsistency, $\\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(T)$, is the sentence $\\lnot(\\lnot\\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner 0=1\\urvenir))$, which is logically equivalent to $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner 0=1\\urvenir)$. The predicate $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ is defined via an existential quantifier, $\\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y, x)$, making it a $\\Sigma_1$ formula. Thus, $\\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(T)$ is a $\\Sigma_1$-sentence.\n    *   If $T$ is consistent, then there is no proof of a contradiction in $T$. This means the statement $\\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(T)$ is false in the standard model of arithmetic.\n    *   If we assume $T$ is **$1$-consistent**, then by definition, $T$ cannot prove any false $\\Sigma_1$-sentences. Since $\\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(T)$ is a false $\\Sigma_1$-sentence, it follows that $T \\nvdash \\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(T)$.\n    *   Therefore, the hypothesis needed to ensure a consistent theory does not prove its own inconsistency is $1$-consistency.\n\n**3. The Witnessing Sentence**\n\n*   The gap in hypotheses is between an undecidable sentence (First Theorem) and the unprovability of the consistency statement (Second Theorem). Mere consistency suffices for both $T \\nvdash G_T$ and $T \\nvdash \\mathrm{Con}(T)$. The stronger hypothesis ($1$-consistency) is needed to show $T \\nvdash \\lnot \\mathrm{Con}(T)$.\n*   What sentence demonstrates that mere consistency is insufficient for this latter task? It must be a sentence that is provable in some theory $T'$ that is consistent but not $1$-consistent. The sentence $\\lnot \\mathrm{Con}(T')$ is the perfect candidate.\n*   Consider the theory $T' = \\mathrm{PA} + \\lnot \\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{PA})$, where $\\mathrm{PA}$ is Peano Arithmetic.\n    *   Assuming $\\mathrm{PA}$ is consistent, Gödel's Second Theorem for $\\mathrm{PA}$ states $\\mathrm{PA} \\nvdash \\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{PA})$. This implies that the theory $T'$ is also consistent.\n    *   By its construction, $T'$ proves $\\lnot \\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{PA})$.\n    *   The sentence $\\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{PA})$ is a $\\Sigma_1$-sentence. Since we assume $\\mathrm{PA}$ is consistent, $\\lnot\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathrm{PA})$ is a false statement.\n    *   So, $T'$ is a consistent theory that proves a false $\\Sigma_1$-sentence. By definition, $T'$ is **$1$-inconsistent**.\n    *   This example demonstrates that consistency alone does not prevent a theory from proving a statement of inconsistency (in this case, for the sub-theory PA). This illustrates why the stronger hypothesis of $1$-consistency is required. The sentence $\\lnot \\mathrm{Con}(\\dots)$ serves as the witness.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\omega$-consistency is the prohibition of proving $\\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ while refuting each instance $\\varphi(\\overline{n})$, and $1$-consistency is the prohibition of proving any false $\\Sigma_1$ sentence; thus $\\omega$-consistency implies $1$-consistency, but not conversely.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The solution involves three parts: a derivation of a formula in the modal logic $GL$, a translation of this derivation into a formal proof in a theory of arithmetic $T$, and a count of the uses of the given derivability conditions in the translated proof.\n\n### 1. Derivation in $GL$\n\nThe goal is to provide a finite derivation of the modal formula $\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box(q \\rightarrow p)$ in the logic $GL$. The rules of inference available are modus ponens (from $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi$, infer $\\psi$) and necessitation (from $\\vdash \\varphi$, infer $\\vdash \\Box \\varphi$). The axioms include all propositional tautologies, axiom $K: \\Box(\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow (\\Box \\varphi \\rightarrow \\Box \\psi)$, and Löb's axiom $L: \\Box(\\Box \\varphi \\rightarrow \\varphi) \\rightarrow \\Box \\varphi$.\n\nThe target formula, $\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box(q \\rightarrow p)$, is a theorem of the logic $K$, which is a sub-logic of $GL$. Therefore, we do not need to use Löb's axiom. The derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  $p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)$\n    This is an instance of a propositional tautology, so it is an axiom in $GL$.\n\n2.  $\\Box(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p))$\n    This follows from line (1) by the rule of Necessitation. Since $p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)$ is a theorem, $\\Box(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p))$ is also a theorem.\n\n3.  $\\Box(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)) \\rightarrow (\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box(q \\rightarrow p))$\n    This is an instance of the axiom schema $K$, i.e., $\\Box(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box B)$, with the substitution $A := p$ and $B := q \\rightarrow p$.\n\n4.  $\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box(q \\rightarrow p)$\n    This follows from lines (2) and (3) by Modus Ponens.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the formula in $GL$.\n\n### 2. Arithmetical Translation into a $T$-derivation\n\nThe second task is to translate the above derivation into a formal proof within the theory $T$. The interpretation maps $p$ to an arithmetical sentence $\\alpha$, $q$ to a sentence $\\beta$, and $\\Box \\varphi$ to $\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\langle \\varphi \\rangle \\urcorner)$. The final goal is to derive $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha \\urvenir)$. The only tools permitted are the derivability conditions $(D1)$, $(D2)$, $(D3)$, and propositional reasoning within $T$.\n\nWe track the GL derivation step-by-step:\n\n1.  **GL step 1:** The axiom $p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)$ is a propositional tautology.\n    **$T$-derivation step 1:** Its translation, $\\alpha \\rightarrow (\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha)$, is also a propositional tautology. Since $T$ is an extension of Peano Arithmetic, it proves all instances of propositional tautologies.\n    $$T \\vdash \\alpha \\rightarrow (\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha)$$\n    This step does not invoke any of the derivability conditions.\n\n2.  **GL step 2:** The formula $\\Box(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p))$ is derived by Necessitation.\n    **$T$-derivation step 2:** The rule of Necessitation corresponds to the derivability condition $(D1)$. Since we have established $T \\vdash \\alpha \\rightarrow (\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha)$ in the previous step, we can apply $(D1)$: if $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$.\n    $$T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\rightarrow (\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\urvenir)$$\n    This step constitutes one invocation of condition $(D1)$.\n\n3.  **GL step 3:** The formula $\\Box(p \\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)) \\rightarrow (\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box(q \\rightarrow p))$ is an instance of axiom $K$.\n    **$T$-derivation step 3:** Axiom $K$ corresponds to the derivability condition $(D2)$: $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi \\urvenir) \\rightarrow (\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir))$. We use the instance of this schema where $\\varphi$ is the sentence $\\alpha$ and $\\psi$ is the sentence $\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha$. This gives us a theorem of $T$.\n    $$T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\rightarrow (\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\big(\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha \\urvenir)\\big)$$\n    This step constitutes one invocation of condition $(D2)$. Note that condition $(D3)$, which corresponds to the modal axiom $4$ ($\\Box\\varphi \\to \\Box\\Box\\varphi$), is not needed for this derivation.\n\n4.  **GL step 4:** The final formula $\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box(q \\rightarrow p)$ is derived by Modus Ponens.\n    **$T$-derivation step 4:** We apply Modus Ponens within the theory $T$. Let $A$ be the sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\rightarrow (\\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\urvenir)$ and $B$ be the sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha \\urvenir)$. From step 2, we have $T \\vdash A$. From step 3, we have $T \\vdash A \\rightarrow B$. By Modus Ponens, we conclude $T \\vdash B$.\n    $$T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\rightarrow \\alpha \\urvenir)$$\n    This step relies on propositional reasoning within $T$ and does not invoke any of the derivability conditions.\n\n### 3. Counting Invocations\n\nThe final task is to compute the ordered triple $(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3})$ representing the number of times conditions $(D1)$, $(D2)$, and $(D3)$ were invoked in the $T$-derivation presented in Part 2.\n\n-   $n_{1}$: Condition $(D1)$ was used exactly once, in step 2 of the $T$-derivation, to internalize the provability of a tautology.\n-   $n_{2}$: Condition $(D2)$ was used exactly once, in step 3 of the $T$-derivation, as the arithmetical counterpart of the modal axiom $K$.\n-   $n_{3}$: Condition $(D3)$, $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$, was not used at all in the derivation.\n\nThus, the counts are $n_{1} = 1$, $n_{2} = 1$, and $n_{3} = 0$. The ordered triple is $(1, 1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2971576"}]}
