To appreciate this, one must first master the modern, semantic proof of the Compactness Theorem itself. This practice guides you through the ultraproduct construction and the statement of Łoś's Theorem, which provides a powerful bridge between the truth of a formula in an ultraproduct and its truth in the component structures [@problem_id:2976157].", "problem": "Select the option that correctly and precisely accomplishes all of the following in the context of First-Order logic (FO): defines the ultraproduct of a family of structures using an ultrafilter, states Łoś’s Theorem for FO formulas (not just sentences), and explains, at a level suitable for use in Lindström’s theorem, why Łoś’s Theorem supports the Compactness Theorem for FO.\n\nA. Given a family $\\{\\mathcal{M}_i : i \\in I\\}$ of $\\mathcal{L}$-structures and an ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $I$, the ultraproduct $\\prod_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_i / \\mathcal{U}$ has domain the set of $\\mathcal{U}$-equivalence classes of functions $a : I \\to \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} M_i$ (with $a(i) \\in M_i$), where $a \\sim b$ iff $\\{ i \\in I : a(i) = b(i) \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. For each function symbol $f$ of arity $n$, define $f^{\\prod/\\mathcal{U}}([a_1],\\dots,[a_n]) = [i \\mapsto f^{\\mathcal{M}_i}(a_1(i),\\dots,a_n(i))]$. For each relation symbol $R$ of arity $n$, declare $R^{\\prod/\\mathcal{U}}([a_1],\\dots,[a_n])$ to hold iff $\\{ i \\in I : R^{\\mathcal{M}_i}(a_1(i),\\dots,a_n(i)) \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. Łoś’s Theorem: for every FO formula $\\varphi(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ and $[a_1],\\dots,[a_n]$ in the ultraproduct, $$\\prod_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_i / \\mathcal{U} \\models \\varphi([a_1],\\dots,[a_n]) \\quad \\text{iff} \\quad \\{ i \\in I : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\varphi(a_1(i),\\dots,a_n(i)) \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}.$$ This supports Compactness: given a set $\\Gamma$ of FO sentences with every finite subset satisfiable, index by $I$ the set of finite $\\Delta \\subseteq \\Gamma$ and pick $\\mathcal{M}_\\Delta \\models \\Delta$. Let $\\mathcal{U}$ be an ultrafilter on $I$ extending the filter generated by the cones $X_\\varphi = \\{ \\Delta \\in I : \\varphi \\in \\Delta \\}$ for $\\varphi \\in \\Gamma$. By Łoś’s Theorem, $\\prod_{\\Delta \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_\\Delta / \\mathcal{U} \\models \\Gamma$, proving Compactness. This is a key ingredient in the characterization in Lindström’s theorem that FO is maximal among abstract logics satisfying Compactness and the Downward Löwenheim–Skolem property.\n\nB. The ultraproduct of $\\{\\mathcal{M}_i : i \\in I\\}$ with respect to a filter $\\mathcal{F}$ on $I$ is the Cartesian product $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$ with pointwise interpretation of symbols, and Łoś’s Theorem states that for each FO sentence $\\sigma$, $\\prod_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\sigma$ iff $\\{ i \\in I : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\sigma \\} \\in \\mathcal{F}$. This shows the Completeness Theorem and therefore implies Compactness, which is the main hypothesis in Lindström’s theorem.\n\nC. The ultraproduct is formed by taking the Cartesian product $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$ and interpreting relations and functions coordinatewise, using the cofinite filter to define truth: a formula holds in the ultraproduct iff it holds in $\\mathcal{M}_i$ for all but finitely many $i \\in I$. Łoś’s Theorem holds for sentences but not for formulas with free variables, and this suffices to deduce Compactness by an easy coding argument, which is the primary tool in Lindström’s theorem.\n\nD. An ultraproduct is any substructure of a direct product closed under projections, and Łoś’s Theorem asserts that if each $\\mathcal{M}_i$ satisfies an FO sentence $\\sigma$, then so does the product; this yields the Upward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem, which in turn implies Compactness and provides the core of Lindström’s theorem.", "solution": "The problem statement requires selecting the option that correctly defines the ultraproduct construction, states Łoś’s Theorem for first-order formulas, and explains the theorem's role in proving the Compactness Theorem for first-order logic (FO) within the context of Lindström's theorem. The problem statement itself is a valid directive for a task in mathematical logic. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed to analyze each option.\n\nThe core components required for a correct answer are:\n1.  **Ultraproduct Definition**: A precise definition of the structure $\\prod_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_i / \\mathcal{U}$, including its domain (as equivalence classes on the Cartesian product $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$) and the interpretation of function and relation symbols. The equivalence relation must be defined via an ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on the index set $I$.\n2.  **Łoś's Theorem**: A correct statement of the theorem for any FO formula $\\varphi(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$, not just sentences. The theorem establishes an equivalence: a formula is true in the ultraproduct for a given assignment of elements if and only if the set of indices for which the formula is true in the component structures (with the corresponding component assignments) is a member of the ultrafilter.\n3.  **Connection to Compactness and Lindström's Theorem**: A correct outline of the proof of the Compactness Theorem for FO using ultraproducts. This involves constructing a model for an infinitely satisfiable set of sentences $\\Gamma$ from models of its finite subsets. The explanation should also correctly situate this result in the context of Lindström's theorem, which characterizes FO in terms of the Compactness and Downward Löwenheim-Skolem properties.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\n1.  **Ultraproduct Definition**: Option A defines the domain of the ultraproduct $\\prod_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_i / \\mathcal{U}$ as the set of $\\mathcal{U}$-equivalence classes of functions $a: I \\to \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} M_i$ where $a(i) \\in M_i$. This is a correct, if slightly verbose, description of elements of the Cartesian product $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$. The equivalence relation is correctly stated as $a \\sim b$ iff $\\{ i \\in I : a(i) = b(i) \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. The interpretation of an $n$-ary function symbol $f$ is given by $f^{\\prod/\\mathcal{U}}([a_1],\\dots,[a_n]) = [i \\mapsto f^{\\mathcal{M}_i}(a_1(i),\\dots,a_n(i))]$, and an $n$-ary relation symbol $R$ by $R^{\\prod/\\mathcal{U}}([a_1],\\dots,[a_n])$ holding iff $\\{ i \\in I : R^{\\mathcal{M}_i}(a_1(i),\\dots,a_n(i)) \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. These definitions are standard and correct.\n\n2.  **Łoś's Theorem**: The option states that for any FO formula $\\varphi(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ and elements $[a_1], \\ldots, [a_n]$ from the ultraproduct, we have $\\prod_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_i / \\mathcal{U} \\models \\varphi([a_1],\\dots,[a_n])$ iff $\\{ i \\in I : \\mathcal{M}_i \\models \\varphi(a_1(i),\\dots,a_n(i)) \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$. This is the correct and general form of Łoś's Theorem, applicable to all formulas, as required by the problem.\n\n3.  **Connection to Compactness and Lindström's Theorem**: The explanation correctly outlines the standard ultraproduct proof of the Compactness Theorem. It starts with a set of sentences $\\Gamma$ where every finite subset $\\Delta$ has a model $\\mathcal{M}_\\Delta$. The index set $I$ is the set of all such finite subsets $\\Delta$. It correctly identifies the need for an ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$ on $I$ that extends the filter generated by the sets $X_\\varphi = \\{ \\Delta \\in I : \\varphi \\in \\Delta \\}$ for each $\\varphi \\in \\Gamma$. The existence of such an ultrafilter is guaranteed by the Ultrafilter Lemma (a consequence of the Axiom of Choice). It correctly concludes that by applying Łoś's Theorem to the ultraproduct $\\prod_{\\Delta \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_\\Delta / \\mathcal{U}$, one can show this structure is a model of all of $\\Gamma$. For any $\\sigma \\in \\Gamma$, the set $X_\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{U}$. Since for any $\\Delta \\in X_\\sigma$ we have $\\sigma \\in \\Delta$ and thus $\\mathcal{M}_\\Delta \\models \\sigma$, it follows that $X_\\sigma \\subseteq \\{ \\Delta \\in I : \\mathcal{M}_\\Delta \\models \\sigma \\}$. As ultrafilters are closed under supersets, we have $\\{ \\Delta \\in I : \\mathcal{M}_\\Delta \\models \\sigma \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$, so by Łoś's Theorem, the ultraproduct models $\\sigma$. Finally, it correctly states the significance for Lindström's theorem: FO is characterized as the maximal abstract logic satisfying both Compactness and the Downward Löwenheim-Skolem property. This entire explanation is accurate and relevant.\n\n**Verdict for Option A**: Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n1.  **Ultraproduct Definition**: This option claims the structure is built with respect to a *filter* $\\mathcal{F}$, not an ultrafilter. It also states the domain is the Cartesian product $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$, omitting the crucial step of taking a quotient by an equivalence relation. This describes a direct product, not an ultraproduct.\n\n2.  **Łoś's Theorem**: It incorrectly states the theorem for a filter $\\mathcal{F}$ and for the direct product structure. Łoś's Theorem fundamentally relies on the properties of an *ultrafilter* and the quotient structure. Furthermore, it restricts the theorem to sentences, which contradicts the problem specification.\n\n3.  **Connection to Compactness**: It makes a confused claim that Łoś's Theorem shows the Completeness Theorem, which then implies Compactness. The ultraproduct proof of Compactness is a purely semantic proof that bypasses the syntactic notions central to the Completeness Theorem.\n\n**Verdict for Option B**: Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n1.  **Ultraproduct Definition**: It incorrectly specializes the filter to be the *cofinite filter*. While the cofinite filter is a filter, it is only an ultrafilter if the index set $I$ is finite (in which case the ultraproduct is isomorphic to one of the component structures). For infinite sets, it is not an ultrafilter. The concept of an ultraproduct requires a general ultrafilter. It also omits the quotient construction.\n\n2.  **Łoś's Theorem**: It makes the factually incorrect claim that Łoś's Theorem \"holds for sentences but not for formulas with free variables\". The strength and utility of the theorem come precisely from the fact that it holds for all first-order formulas, which is proven by induction on the complexity of the formula.\n\n3.  **Connection to Compactness**: The explanation is built upon the false premise that the theorem is restricted to sentences.\n\n**Verdict for Option C**: Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n1.  **Ultraproduct Definition**: It provides a definition—\"any substructure of a direct product closed under projections\"—that is completely unrelated to the standard definition of an ultraproduct. An ultraproduct is a *quotient* of a direct product.\n\n2.  **Łoś's Theorem**: It misstates the theorem as a simple preservation property: \"if each $\\mathcal{M}_i$ satisfies an FO sentence $\\sigma$, then so does the product\". This is a weak consequence of the actual theorem and holds for products only for certain kinds of sentences (universal sentences). Łoś's Theorem is a much more powerful bi-conditional transfer principle.\n\n3.  **Connection to Compactness**: It incorrectly links Łoś's Theorem to the *Upward* Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem and then to Compactness. More importantly, it misidentifies the components of Lindström's theorem, which uses the *Downward* Löwenheim-Skolem property, not the upward one.\n\n**Verdict for Option D**: Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A provides a completely correct and precise account of all three required components: the definition of an ultraproduct, the statement of Łoś's Theorem for formulas, and the explanation of its role in proving the Compactness Theorem and its relevance to Lindström's theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2976157"}, {"introduction": "At its heart, Lindström's theorem is a result about the limits of logical expressivity.

Elementary equivalence is the special case $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv \\mathfrak{B}$ where $\\mathcal{L}$ is first-order logic.**\n\nThis option provides definitions for three central concepts.\n1.  **Logical equivalence**: Two sentences $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are logically equivalent if they are true in the same set of structures. The statement correctly defines this for first-order logic ($\\text{FO}$), using the standard notation $\\models$ for $\\models_{\\text{FO}}$.\n2.  **$\\mathcal{L}$-equivalence**: Two structures $\\mathfrak{A}$ and $\\mathfrak{B}$ are $\\mathcal{L}$-equivalent, written $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$, if they satisfy the exact same set of sentences from the logic $\\mathcal{L}$. This is the standard definition of indistinguishability with respect to a logic $\\mathcal{L}$. Formally, $Th_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\mathfrak{A}) = Th_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\mathfrak{B})$, where $Th_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\mathfrak{M}) = \\{\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{L} \\mid \\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma\\}$.\n3.  **Elementary equivalence**: This is defined as the special case of $\\mathcal{L}$-equivalence where $\\mathcal{L}$ is first-order logic ($\\text{FO}$). This is also the standard definition.\n\nAll definitions provided in this option are standard and correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$, then for all $\\tau$-structures $\\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{B}$, the implication $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B}$ implies $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$ holds. Equivalently, the partition of $\\tau$-structures into $\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'}$-classes refines the partition into $\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}}$-classes.**\n\nLet us prove the implication from the given definitions.\nAssume $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$. Also, assume we are given two $\\tau$-structures $\\mathfrak{A}$ and $\\mathfrak{B}$ such that $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B}$. We want to show that $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$.\nTo show $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$, we must show that for any sentence $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{L}$, we have $\\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma \\iff \\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma$.\n\nLet $\\sigma$ be an arbitrary sentence in $\\mathcal{L}$.\nFrom the definition of $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$, there exists a sentence $\\sigma' \\in \\mathcal{L}'$ such that for any $\\tau$-structure $\\mathfrak{M}$, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma \\iff \\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma'$.\nApplying this to $\\mathfrak{A}$ and $\\mathfrak{B}$:\n(1) $\\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma \\iff \\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma'$.\n(2) $\\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma \\iff \\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma'$.\n\nBy our assumption $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B}$, for any sentence in $\\mathcal{L}'$, including $\\sigma'$, we have:\n(3) $\\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma' \\iff \\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma'$.\n\nCombining these three equivalences, we get the chain:\n$\\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma \\iff \\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma' \\iff \\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\sigma' \\iff \\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma$.\nThis establishes that $\\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma \\iff \\mathfrak{B} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\sigma$. Since $\\sigma$ was an arbitrary sentence in $\\mathcal{L}$, we have proven that $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$.\n\nThe second part of the statement, \"the partition of $\\tau$-structures into $\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'}$-classes refines the partition into $\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}}$-classes,\" is a direct rephrasing of the implication. A partition $P_1$ refines a partition $P_2$ if every block of $P_1$ is a subset of some block of $P_2$. This is equivalent to saying that the equivalence relation corresponding to $P_1$ implies the equivalence relation corresponding to $P_2$. Here, this means $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B} \\implies \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$, then for all $\\tau$-structures $\\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{B}$, the implication $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$ implies $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B}$ holds.**\n\nThis is the converse of the implication in option B. This would only hold if $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{L}'$ have the same expressive power. If $\\mathcal{L}'$ is strictly more expressive than $\\mathcal{L}$ (i.e., $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$ but not $\\mathcal{L}' \\leq \\mathcal{L}$), then there exists a sentence $\\sigma' \\in \\mathcal{L}'$ which is not equivalent to any sentence in $\\mathcal{L}$. This means there must be structures that $\\mathcal{L}$ cannot distinguish but $\\mathcal{L}'$ can.\n\nLet's construct a counterexample. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be first-order logic, $\\text{FO}$. Let $\\mathcal{L}'$ be a logic that can express the finiteness of a structure, for instance, second-order logic ($\\text{SO}$) or $\\text{FO}$ with a quantifier for infinity, $\\text{FO}(\\exists^\\infty)$. We have $\\text{FO} \\leq \\text{SO}$.\nConsider the signature with only equality. Let $\\mathfrak{A}$ be a countably infinite set and $\\mathfrak{B}$ be an uncountable set. By the properties of first-order logic (e.g., via Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games or the Löwenheim-Skolem theorems), any two infinite sets are elementarily equivalent in this signature: $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\text{FO}} \\mathfrak{B}$.\nHowever, in $\\text{SO}$, we can express countability. There is an $\\text{SO}$-sentence $\\sigma'_{count}$ that is true in a structure if and only if its domain is countable. Then $\\mathfrak{A} \\models_{\\text{SO}} \\sigma'_{count}$ but $\\mathfrak{B} \\not\\models_{\\text{SO}} \\sigma'_{count}$. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{A} \\not\\equiv_{\\text{SO}} \\mathfrak{B}$.\nThis provides a case where $\\mathcal{L} = \\text{FO}$ and $\\mathcal{L}' = \\text{SO}$, we have $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$ but $\\mathfrak{A} \\not\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B}$. The implication is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The refinement property characterizes expressive inclusion: $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$ if and only if for all $\\tau$-structures $\\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{B}$, $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B}$ implies $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$.**\n\nThis statement claims an equivalence: $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}' \\iff (\\forall \\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{B} (\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B} \\implies \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}))$.\nThe $(\\Rightarrow)$ direction was proven correct in the analysis of option B.\nThe $(\\Leftarrow)$ direction claims: If $(\\forall \\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{B} (\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\mathfrak{B} \\implies \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}))$, then $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$.\nThis is a standard theorem in abstract model theory, but its proof requires assumptions on the logic that are stronger than what is explicitly stated in the problem's definition of an \"abstract logic\". Specifically, the proof typically requires the logic to be \"regular\", which includes closure under quantification and relativization. The problem only mentions closure under Boolean connectives and renaming. Without these additional properties, one can construct pathological \"logics\" for which this implication fails. For a statement to be correct, it must be derivable from the given premises. Since the given premises are insufficient to prove the $(\\Leftarrow)$ direction, the \"if and only if\" claim is not formally justified. An exacting analysis requires us to conclude that the statement is not necessarily true under the weak hypotheses provided.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Suppose $\\mathcal{L}$ is an extension of first-order logic (FO) that satisfies Compactness and the Downward Löwenheim–Skolem property. Then by Lindström’s theorem, $\\mathcal{L}$ is no more expressive than FO. Consequently, for every logic $\\mathcal{L}'$, one has $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$ if and only if \\emph{first-order logic (FO)} $\\leq \\mathcal{L}'$, and for all $\\tau$-structures $\\mathfrak{A},\\mathfrak{B}$, $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B}$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv \\mathfrak{B}$ (elementary equivalence).**\n\nThis option presents an application of Lindström's theorem and its consequences.\n1.  **Lindström's Theorem**: The theorem states that any regular abstract logic $\\mathcal{L}$ that is an extension of $\\text{FO}$ ($\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}$) and satisfies both the Compactness and Downward Löwenheim-Skolem properties must be equivalent in expressive power to $\\text{FO}$ ($\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\text{FO}$). The problem states $\\mathcal{L}$ is an \"extension of FO\", which implies $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}$ and that $\\mathcal{L}$ inherits the structural properties of FO needed for it to be a regular logic. Thus, applying Lindström's theorem, we conclude $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\text{FO}$. Combined with $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}$, we get $\\mathcal{L} \\equiv \\text{FO}$, meaning they have the same expressive power. The phrase \"$\\mathcal{L}$ is no more expressive than FO\" is a correct conclusion.\n2.  **First Consequence**: We must check if $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}' \\iff \\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$.\n    - $(\\Rightarrow)$: Assume $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$. We know $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}$. By transitivity of the preorder $\\leq$, we have $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$, which implies $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$.\n    - $(\\Leftarrow)$: Assume $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$. We know $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\text{FO}$. By transitivity, $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$, which implies $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$.\n    This equivalence is correct.\n3.  **Second Consequence**: We must check if $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B} \\iff \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv \\mathfrak{B}$. Elementary equivalence $\\equiv$ is just $\\equiv_{\\text{FO}}$. So we need to show $\\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} = \\equiv_{\\text{FO}}$.\n    From $\\mathcal{L} \\equiv \\text{FO}$, we have both $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\text{FO}$ and $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L}$.\n    From option B, $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\text{FO} \\implies (\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\text{FO}} \\mathfrak{B} \\implies \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B})$.\n    From option B again, $\\text{FO} \\leq \\mathcal{L} \\implies (\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B} \\implies \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\text{FO}} \\mathfrak{B})$.\n    These two implications together establish $\\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\mathcal{L}} \\mathfrak{B} \\iff \\mathfrak{A} \\equiv_{\\text{FO}} \\mathfrak{B}$. This is also correct.\n\nThe entire statement is a sound application of Lindström's theorem and its consequences.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**F. If $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$ and $T$ is any $\\mathcal{L}$-theory (a set of $\\mathcal{L}$-sentences), then there exists an $\\mathcal{L}'$-theory $T'$ such that for every $\\tau$-structure $\\mathfrak{M}$, one has $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} T$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} T'$.**\n\nLet us attempt to construct the theory $T'$ from the theory $T$.\nLet $T = \\{\\varphi_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$ be an $\\mathcal{L}$-theory, where $I$ is some index set.\nWe are given $\\mathcal{L} \\leq \\mathcal{L}'$. By definition, for each $\\varphi_i \\in T$, there exists a sentence $\\psi_i \\in \\mathcal{L}'$ such that for any structure $\\mathfrak{M}$, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\varphi_i \\iff \\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\psi_i$.\n\nLet us define the $\\mathcal{L}'$-theory $T'$ as the set of these corresponding sentences: $T' = \\{\\psi_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$.\nNow we verify if this $T'$ has the desired property.\nA structure $\\mathfrak{M}$ is a model of a theory if it satisfies every sentence in the theory.\n$\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} T \\iff \\forall i \\in I, \\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\varphi_i$.\n$\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} T' \\iff \\forall i \\in I, \\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\psi_i$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{M}$ be an arbitrary structure.\nSuppose $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} T$. Then for every $i \\in I$, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\varphi_i$. By the choice of $\\psi_i$, this implies that for every $i \\in I$, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\psi_i$. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} T'$.\nConversely, suppose $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} T'$. Then for every $i \\in I$, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} \\psi_i$. By the choice of $\\psi_i$, this implies that for every $i \\in I$, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} \\varphi_i$. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} T$.\nThus, we have shown that $\\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}} T \\iff \\mathfrak{M} \\models_{\\mathcal{L}'} T'$. This holds for any theory $T$, regardless of its size (finite, countable, or uncountable).

Take the complete theory $T=\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$ in the language of rings. Let $M=\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ (transcendence degree $0$) and let $N$ be a countable algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ and transcendence degree $1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.

By Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem there are Scott sentences $\\sigma_M,\\sigma_N\\in L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ with $M\\models\\sigma_M$, $N\\not\\models\\sigma_M$ and vice versa, so their $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories differ. This shows $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ is strictly more expressive on countable structures, and there is no conflict with Lindström’s theorem because $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ fails Compactness.\n\nB. Let $T$ be the complete theory of the countable random graph in the language with a single binary relation symbol. Let $M$ be the countable random graph and $N$ the disjoint union of two copies of the countable random graph. These are nonisomorphic but satisfy the same first-order theory (since first-order logic cannot express connectedness). Hence their difference must be witnessed by an $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-sentence. This violates Lindström’s theorem unless $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ has Compactness.\n\nC. Let $T$ be the complete theory of dense linear orders without endpoints. Take $M=(\\mathbb{Q},)$ and $N=(\\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\},)$. These are nonisomorphic countable models of the same complete first-order theory. However, since on countable structures $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ and first-order logic coincide, their $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories are the same, in harmony with Lindström’s theorem.\n\nD. Let $T=\\mathrm{RCF}$, the complete theory of real closed fields in the language of ordered rings. Let $M$ be the real closure of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (archimedean, countable) and let $N$ be the real closure of $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$ for an indeterminate $t$ (non-archimedean, countable). Then $M$ and $N$ are nonisomorphic but satisfy the same first-order theory $T$. By Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem, there are Scott sentences distinguishing them in $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$, so their $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories differ. This displays that $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ is strictly more expressive on countable structures, and this does not contradict Lindström’s theorem because $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ fails Compactness (and does not enjoy the full Löwenheim–Skolem property that characterizes first-order logic).", "solution": "We proceed from the fundamental definitions and theorems listed in the problem statement. The task is to verify, option by option, whether the proposed examples indeed yield:\n- two countable, nonisomorphic models $M,N$ of the same complete first-order theory $T$, hence $\\operatorname{Th}_{\\mathrm{FO}}(M)=\\operatorname{Th}_{\\mathrm{FO}}(N)=T$;\n- distinct $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories, which, by Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem, is equivalent to nonisomorphism on the countable domain; and\n- a correct account of the relevance to Lindström’s theorem (namely, that any strict expressive extension of first-order logic must fail Compactness or the Löwenheim–Skolem property, and $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ indeed fails Compactness).\n\nAnalysis of Option A.\n- Correctness of the first-order part: The theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$ is complete in the language of rings and admits quantifier elimination. Any algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ is a model of this complete theory. In particular, $M=\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ (transcendence degree $0$) and a countable $N$ of transcendence degree $1$ (for example, the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$) both satisfy $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$. They are nonisomorphic because algebraic closures of fields with different transcendence degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be isomorphic as fields: transcendence degree is an isomorphism invariant.\n- Distinct $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories: Since $M$ and $N$ are countable and nonisomorphic, Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem yields Scott sentences $\\sigma_M,\\sigma_N\\in L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ characterizing $M$ and $N$, respectively, up to isomorphism among countable models. Hence $M\\models \\sigma_M$ while $N\\not\\models \\sigma_M$, and conversely, so $\\operatorname{Th}_{L_{\\omega_1\\omega}}(M)\\ne \\operatorname{Th}_{L_{\\omega_1\\omega}}(N)$.\n- Relevance to Lindström’s theorem: This demonstrates that $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ is strictly more expressive than first-order logic on countable structures (first-order cannot separate elementarily equivalent models, $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ can). There is no contradiction with Lindström’s theorem because $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ fails Compactness (for example, the $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-set $\\{\\,\\exists^{\\ge n} x\\, (x=x)\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\,\\}\\cup\\{\\,\\neg \\exists^{\\ge \\aleph_0} x\\, (x=x)\\,\\}$ is finitely satisfiable but not satisfiable), so it does not satisfy the joint Compactness and Löwenheim–Skolem properties that characterize first-order logic.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nAnalysis of Option B.\n- First-order theory issue: The countable random graph $R$ is the unique (up to isomorphism) countable model of its complete first-order theory, characterized by the extension axioms: for all disjoint finite sets $U,V$ of vertices, there exists a vertex adjacent to all of $U$ and to none of $V$. Let $M=R$. The disjoint union $N=R\\sqcup R$ fails the extension axiom: take $U$ a singleton from the first component and $V$ a singleton from the second; no vertex is adjacent to all of $U$ and to none of $V$ across components. Therefore $N$ is not a model of the random graph theory, and $\\operatorname{Th}_{\\mathrm{FO}}(M)\\ne \\operatorname{Th}_{\\mathrm{FO}}(N)$.\n- The claim that first-order logic cannot express connectedness is immaterial here; the failure is already at the level of the extension axioms.\n- The discussion of Lindström’s theorem in the option is also problematic, hinging on an incorrect premise (that $M$ and $N$ share the same first-order theory).\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nAnalysis of Option C.\n- Structure and isomorphism: The theory of dense linear orders without endpoints (DLO) is complete and $\\aleph_0$-categorical: every countable model of DLO is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Q},)$. The structure $(\\mathbb{Q}\\setminus\\{0\\},)$ is still a dense linear order without endpoints and therefore is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Q},)$. Hence $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic, contrary to the requirement of nonisomorphic models.\n- The assertion that on countable structures $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ and first-order logic coincide is false. On the contrary, by Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem, $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ can distinguish nonisomorphic countable structures sharing the same first-order theory by means of Scott sentences.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nAnalysis of Option D.\n- First-order theory: The theory $\\mathrm{RCF}$ of real closed fields in the language of ordered rings is complete and admits quantifier elimination. Thus any two real closed fields, regardless of archimedean or non-archimedean behavior or transcendence degree, are elementarily equivalent. Let $M$ be the real closure of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (it is countable and archimedean), and $N$ be the real closure of $\\mathbb{Q}(t)$ for an indeterminate $t$ (it is countable and non-archimedean). These are nonisomorphic because archimedeanity is an isomorphism invariant of ordered fields. Both satisfy $\\mathrm{RCF}$.\n- Distinct $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories: As in Option A, Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem yields Scott sentences distinguishing $M$ and $N$ in $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$, hence their $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories differ.\n- Relevance to Lindström’s theorem: This again witnesses that $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ is strictly more expressive on countable structures, without contradicting Lindström’s theorem because $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ fails Compactness (and in any case does not enjoy the full constellation of properties that characterize first-order logic in Lindström’s theorem).\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nSynthesis and conceptual explanation. The key mechanism in both correct options is:\n- pick a complete first-order theory $T$ with multiple nonisomorphic countable models (for instance, $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ or $\\mathrm{RCF}$);\n- observe that first-order logic cannot distinguish these models, since they are models of the same complete theory $T$;\n- invoke Scott’s Isomorphism Theorem to obtain $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-sentences that distinguish them, proving that their $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$-theories differ.\n\nThis demonstrates a strict increase in expressive power from first-order logic to $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ on countable structures. There is no tension with Lindström’s theorem, because $L_{\\omega_1\\omega}$ fails Compactness, and Lindström’s characterization applies only to logics that extend first-order logic while preserving both Compactness and the Downward Löwenheim–Skolem property to a countable submodel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2976166"}]}
