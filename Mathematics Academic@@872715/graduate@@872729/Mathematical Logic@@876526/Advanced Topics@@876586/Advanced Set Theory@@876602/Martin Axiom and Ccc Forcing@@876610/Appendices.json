That is, for any $p, q \\in X$, there exists $r \\in P$ such that $r \\leq p$ and $r \\leq q$.\n2.  **Centered Set**: A subset $X \\subseteq P$ is called **centered** if every finite subset of $X$ has a lower bound in $P$. That is, for any finite set $\\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\} \\subseteq X$, there exists a condition $r \\in P$ such that $r \\leq p_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nAn immediate consequence of these definitions is that every centered set is also a linked set. If a set $X$ is centered, then for any two elements $p, q \\in X$, the finite subset $\\{p,q\\}$ has a lower bound, which means $p$ and $q$ are compatible. Therefore, $X$ is linked. The converse is not true; a set can be linked but not centered.\n\nWith these foundational definitions, we define the properties in question:\n\n3.  **$\\sigma$-linked**: The poset $\\mathbb{P}$ is **$\\sigma$-linked** if $P$ is the union of countably many linked sets. That is, $P = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} L_n$, where each $L_n$ is a linked subset of $P$.\n4.  **$\\sigma$-centered**: The poset $\\mathbb{P}$ is **$\\sigma$-centered** if $P$ is the union of countably many centered sets. That is, $P = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} C_n$, where each $C_n$ is a centered subset of $P$.\n5.  **Knaster (Property K)**: The poset $\\mathbb{P}$ is **Knaster** if every uncountable subset of $P$ contains an uncountable linked subset.\n6.  **Precaliber $\\aleph_1$**: The poset $\\mathbb{P}$ is **precaliber $\\aleph_1$** if every uncountable subset of $P$ contains an uncountable centered subset.\n\n**Derivation of Implications:**\n\nNow we establish the logical implications between these properties, which must hold in $\\mathsf{ZFC}$.\n\n1.  **$\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ $\\sigma$-linked**:\n    Assume $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\sigma$-centered. Then $P = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} C_n$ for some collection of centered sets $\\{C_n\\}_{n \\in \\omega}$. As established, every centered set is linked. Thus, each $C_n$ is a linked set. This means $P$ is a countable union of linked sets, so by definition, $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\sigma$-linked.\n\n2.  **$\\sigma$-linked $\\Rightarrow$ Knaster**:\n    Assume $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\sigma$-linked. Then $P = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} L_n$ where each $L_n$ is linked. Let $A \\subseteq P$ be an uncountable set. We can write $A = A \\cap P = A \\cap (\\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} L_n) = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} (A \\cap L_n)$. Since $A$ is an uncountable set written as a countable union of sets, at least one of these sets, say $A \\cap L_{n_0}$ for some $n_0 \\in \\omega$, must be uncountable. Let $B = A \\cap L_{n_0}$. Then $B$ is an uncountable subset of $A$. Since $B \\subseteq L_{n_0}$ and $L_{n_0}$ is a linked set, $B$ is a linked set. Thus, $A$ has an uncountable linked subset, which means $\\mathbb{P}$ is Knaster.\n\n3.  **Knaster $\\Rightarrow$ ccc**:\n    Assume $\\mathbb{P}$ is Knaster. Suppose for contradiction that $\\mathbb{P}$ does not satisfy the countable chain condition (ccc). Then there exists an uncountable antichain $A \\subseteq P$. Since $A$ is an uncountable set and $\\mathbb{P}$ is Knaster, $A$ must contain an uncountable linked subset, say $B \\subseteq A$. Let $p, q$ be two distinct elements of $B$. Since $B$ is linked, $p$ and $q$ are compatible. However, since $p, q \\in A$ and $A$ is an antichain, $p$ and $q$ must be incompatible. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial supposition must be false, so $\\mathbb{P}$ must satisfy the ccc.\n\nThis establishes the primary chain of implications: $\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ $\\sigma$-linked $\\Rightarrow$ Knaster $\\Rightarrow$ ccc.\n\nNow we analyze the position of precaliber $\\aleph_1$.\n\n4.  **$\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ precaliber $\\aleph_1$**:\n    Assume $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\sigma$-centered. Then $P = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} C_n$ where each $C_n$ is centered. Let $A \\subseteq P$ be an uncountable set. By the same pigeonhole principle argument as in ($2$), there must exist some $n_0 \\in \\omega$ such that $B = A \\cap C_{n_0}$ is uncountable. Since $B \\subseteq C_{n_0}$ and $C_{n_0}$ is a centered set, $B$ is also a centered set. Therefore, $A$ contains an uncountable centered subset, which proves that $\\mathbb{P}$ is precaliber $\\aleph_1$.\n\n5.  **precaliber $\\aleph_1$ $\\Rightarrow$ Knaster**:\n    Assume $\\mathbb{P}$ is precaliber $\\aleph_1$. Let $A \\subseteq P$ be an uncountable set. By definition of precaliber $\\aleph_1$, $A$ has an uncountable centered subset, say $B \\subseteq A$. Since every centered set is linked, $B$ is an uncountable linked subset of $A$. This satisfies the definition of the Knaster property.\n\nThis establishes a second chain: $\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ precaliber $\\aleph_1 \\Rightarrow$ Knaster.\n\nCombining our findings, we have the following implication structure:\n- $\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ $\\sigma$-linked $\\Rightarrow$ Knaster $\\Rightarrow$ ccc\n- $\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ precaliber $\\aleph_1 \\Rightarrow$ Knaster\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A.**\n- **Definitions**: The definitions provided for $\\sigma$-centered, $\\sigma$-linked, Knaster, and precaliber $\\aleph_1$ match the standard mathematical definitions derived above.\n- **Implications**: The stated implications, $\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ $\\sigma$-linked $\\Rightarrow$ Knaster $\\Rightarrow$ ccc, and $\\sigma$-centered $\\Rightarrow$ precaliber $\\aleph_1 \\Rightarrow$ Knaster, are precisely the chains we derived as provable in $\\mathsf{ZFC}$.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B.**\n- **Definitions**: The definitions of $\\sigma$-linked and $\\sigma$-centered are swapped.

This is the reverse of the correct implication chain, and none of these reverse implications hold in general. For example, a Souslin tree is a ccc poset that is not Knaster. Further, it claims that precaliber $\\aleph_1$ is equivalent to $\\sigma$-linked, which is false. While both imply Knaster, there is no general implication between them.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only option A presents both the correct definitions and the correct implication chains.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2976896"}, {"introduction": "The theory of forcing is not just about abstract properties; it is also an engineering discipline for constructing mathematical universes.

Detection: Given any uncountable $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)$, apply the generalized $\\Delta$-system lemma to the set of domains to obtain an uncountable subfamily with a common root $r$. If the traces on $r$ vary across uncountably many conditions, then any two such conditions are incompatible, yielding an uncountable antichain. Refinement: Redesign the forcing to use only finite conditions, namely $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{fin}}(X)=\\{p:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\operatorname{dom}(p)|\\omega\\}$ with the same extension order. Then for any uncountable subfamily, the $\\Delta$-system lemma gives a finite root $r$; there are only finitely many functions $r \\to \\{0,1\\}$, so by the pigeonhole principle uncountably many conditions agree on $r$ and, because their remainders are disjoint, are pairwise compatible. Hence $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{fin}}(X)$ is $\\omega_1$-Knaster and thus ccc.\n\nB. Detection: Check whether every uncountable subset of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)$ contains two comparable conditions; if not, the poset is not ccc. Refinement: Replace the order $\\leq$ by the relation of being an initial segment to ensure that chains are long and antichains shrink, which forces the ccc.\n\nC. Detection: Under Martin’s Axiom, any poset of size at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is ccc, so it suffices to verify $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)|\\leq 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Refinement: If $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)|2^{\\aleph_0}$, collapse $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)|$ to be at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ by adding a generic bijection; this enforces ccc.\n\nD. Detection: Use the $\\Delta$-system lemma on domains to find a common root $r$ and then quotient $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)$ by the equivalence relation “agree on $r$.” The large number of equivalence classes signals a large antichain. Refinement: Pass to the quotient poset by identifying conditions that agree on $r$; equivalence classes are centered, so the quotient is $\\sigma$-centered and hence ccc.\n\nChoose the single best option.", "solution": "We begin from the core definitions and lemmas.\n\nAn antichain in a poset $\\mathbb{P}$ is a set $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{P}$ such that for distinct $p,q\\in A$ there is no $r\\in\\mathbb{P}$ with $r\\leq p$ and $r\\leq q$. The countable chain condition (ccc) says every antichain is countable. For forcing notions built from partial functions and ordered by extension, compatibility is governed by agreement on overlaps: $p$ and $q$ are compatible if and only if $p\\cup q$ is a function, that is, $p\\restriction(\\operatorname{dom}(p)\\cap \\operatorname{dom}(q))=q\\restriction(\\operatorname{dom}(p)\\cap \\operatorname{dom}(q))$.\n\nThe generalized $\\Delta$-system lemma states that if $\\kappa$ is regular uncountable and one has a family $\\{a_\\xi:\\xi\\kappa\\}$ of sets each of cardinality less than $\\kappa$, then there exists an unbounded subfamily of size $\\kappa$ forming a $\\Delta$-system with some fixed root $r$. In our context, taking $a_\\xi=\\operatorname{dom}(p_\\xi)$ for $p_\\xi$ in an uncountable subset of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)$, the lemma yields a large subfamily of conditions whose domains intersect in the same set $r$, and whose pairwise intersections are exactly $r$.\n\nWe analyze each option.\n\nOption A. Detection. Let $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}(X)$ be uncountable. By regularity of $\\kappa$ and $|\\operatorname{dom}(p)|\\kappa$, the generalized $\\Delta$-system lemma yields an uncountable $A_0\\subseteq A$ such that $\\{\\operatorname{dom}(p):p\\in A_0\\}$ forms a $\\Delta$-system with root $r$. For each $p\\in A_0$, define the remainder $s_p=\\operatorname{dom}(p)\\setminus r$, and note that for distinct $p,q\\in A_0$ we have $s_p\\cap s_q=\\varnothing$ and $\\operatorname{dom}(p)\\cap\\operatorname{dom}(q)=r$. Now consider the trace $p\\restriction r$, which is a function $r \\to \\{0,1\\}$. If there are uncountably many distinct traces among $\\{p\\restriction r:p\\in A_0\\}$, then any two conditions with different traces on $r$ are incompatible, because they disagree on their common part of the domain. Therefore, by arranging (or detecting) such variation, one obtains an uncountable antichain. This gives a principled and standard detection mechanism: analyze an uncountable family via the $\\Delta$-system lemma and examine disagreements on the root.\n\nRefinement. Redesign the forcing to use finite conditions:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{fin}}(X)=\\{p:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\operatorname{dom}(p)|\\omega\\},\n$$\nwith the same extension order. We claim $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{fin}}(X)$ is $\\omega_1$-Knaster (and hence ccc). Let $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{fin}}(X)$ be uncountable. Apply the (classical) $\\Delta$-system lemma to the finite domains to obtain an uncountable $A_0\\subseteq A$ with a fixed finite root $r$ so that $\\{\\operatorname{dom}(p):p\\in A_0\\}$ is a $\\Delta$-system with root $r$. There are only $2^{|r|}\\omega$ many possible functions $r \\to \\{0,1\\}$. By the pigeonhole principle (applied to an uncountable set partitioned into finitely many classes), there exists an uncountable $A_1\\subseteq A_0$ such that for all $p,q\\in A_1$ we have $p\\restriction r=q\\restriction r$. For distinct $p,q\\in A_1$, the remainders $s_p$ and $s_q$ are disjoint, and $p$ and $q$ agree on $r$, so $p\\cup q$ is a function; hence $p$ and $q$ are compatible. Therefore $A_1$ is an uncountable pairwise compatible subfamily, and $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{fin}}(X)$ is $\\omega_1$-Knaster, implying ccc. This provides a concrete refinement procedure that restores ccc along with a proof that the refined poset has the desired property. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B. The detection criterion given here is: “every uncountable subset contains two comparable conditions; if not, the poset is not ccc.” This confuses chain and chain condition. The ccc restricts antichains, not the existence of comparable pairs or long chains. A poset can fail to have two comparable elements in some uncountable subset and yet be ccc, because ccc only forbids uncountable antichains, not arbitrary uncountable subsets. The proposed refinement “replace the order by initial segment” is ad hoc and lacks justification that it preserves the forcing goal; more importantly, changing the order in this way does not systematically eliminate antichains nor guarantee ccc. There is no general theorem establishing that such a modification forces the ccc for posets of partial functions; in fact, one can easily build uncountable antichains consisting of pairwise incompatible initial segments if the domains overlap and disagree. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C. The detection strategy appeals to Martin’s Axiom to infer ccc from small cardinality, but Martin’s Axiom does not assert that every poset of size at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is ccc; rather, it is a scheme about the existence of filters meeting families of dense sets in ccc posets. The implication “small cardinality implies ccc under MA” is false. The suggested “refinement” to collapse the size of the poset by adding a generic bijection is itself a forcing construction separate from the design at hand; it does not turn a non-ccc poset into a ccc one. Moreover, cardinal collapsing does not change the internal combinatorics of compatibility that determine the ccc. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D. The detection step considers quotienting by “agree on $r$” and inferring from the number of equivalence classes that there is a large antichain. However, many equivalence classes do not directly correspond to antichains in the original order; different classes can contain compatible conditions. The refinement then proposes to “identify” conditions agreeing on $r$ in a quotient poset and asserts that equivalence classes are centered and that the quotient is $\\sigma$-centered. This is not a legitimate forcing refinement: the quotient by identifying equivalent conditions alters the order in a way that does not preserve forcing equivalence in general, and even if one considers the partition by stems $r$, there can be uncountably many such classes, so there is no guarantee of a countable union (required for $\\sigma$-centered). Furthermore, pairwise agreement on $r$ does not imply that entire equivalence classes are centered with respect to the original order, since incompatibility can arise from disagreements off $r$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A provides a correct and principled detection method via the $\\Delta$-system lemma together with a sound refinement to a finite-conditions design and a proof that the refinement is ccc by the $\\omega_1$-Knaster property. This aligns with standard practice in ccc forcing: when a size bound $\\kappa$ with uncountable $\\kappa$ allows coding large antichains by varying a common root, one switches to finite conditions (or imposes a fixed finite stem) so that the $\\Delta$-system lemma plus the pigeonhole principle yield large compatible subfamilies, ensuring ccc and enabling applications of Martin’s Axiom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2976899"}, {"introduction": "The consistency proof of Martin's Axiom combined with the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis ($MA+\\neg CH$) is a crowning achievement of modern set theory, showcasing the power of iterated forcing.

Since $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$ in the final model, this establishes $\\mathrm{MA}_{\\kappa}$, which is equivalent to MA.\n\nA crucial property for this construction to succeed is that the iterated forcing $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ must itself be ccc. This ensures that $\\omega_1$ is not collapsed and that the properties of the iteration are well-behaved.\n\nWe now evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n**A. If each stage $\\Vdash_{\\mathbb{P}_\\beta}$ “$\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_\\beta$ is ccc,” then the finite support iteration $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ is ccc; the standard proof uses the $\\Delta$-system lemma on the finite supports of an uncountable antichain of conditions to find two compatible conditions, contradicting uncountability of the antichain.**\n\nThis statement is a precise articulation of a fundamental theorem in iterated forcing.\nLet $\\{p_i : i  \\omega_1\\}$ be an uncountable set of conditions in $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$. Each condition $p_i$ is a function with a finite domain, called its support, $\\mathrm{supp}(p_i) \\subset \\kappa$. The family of sets $\\{\\mathrm{supp}(p_i) : i  \\omega_1\\}$ is an uncountable family of finite subsets of $\\kappa$. By the $\\Delta$-system lemma, there exists an uncountable subset $I \\subseteq \\omega_1$ and a finite set $R \\subset \\kappa$ (the root) such that for any distinct $i, j \\in I$, we have $\\mathrm{supp}(p_i) \\cap \\mathrm{supp}(p_j) = R$.\nBy passing to a further uncountable subset (and possibly relabeling), we can assume that for all $i, j \\in I$, $p_i \\restriction R = p_j \\restriction R$. This means the conditions agree on their common support. Let $p_i$ and $p_j$ be two such conditions with $i, j \\in I$ and $i \\neq j$. Their supports are $S_i = R \\cup (S_i \\setminus R)$ and $S_j = R \\cup (S_j \\setminus R)$, where $(S_i \\setminus R)$ and $(S_j \\setminus R)$ are disjoint and non-empty. A combined condition $q$ can be defined such that $\\mathrm{supp}(q) = S_i \\cup S_j$, $q \\restriction S_i = p_i$, and $q \\restriction S_j = p_j$. Since $p_i$ and $p_j$ agree on the intersection of their supports ($R$), $q$ is well-defined and is a common extension of $p_i$ and $p_j$. Thus, $p_i$ and $p_j$ are compatible. This argument shows that any uncountable set of conditions in $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ contains a pair of compatible conditions. Therefore, no antichain in $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ can be uncountable. This means $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ has the countable chain condition (ccc). The hypothesis that each stage forcing $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_\\beta$ is forced to be ccc is essential for this proof to go through.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In $V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa}$ one has $\\mathrm{MA}_{\\kappa}$ restricted to ccc posets, and since the iteration adds $\\kappa$ many Cohen reals and has size $\\kappa$, it follows that $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$ and therefore $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$.**\n\nThis statement correctly summarizes the main achievements of the forcing construction.\n1.  $\\mathrm{MA}_{\\kappa}$ in $V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa}$: The bookkeeping argument described in the problem statement is precisely designed to ensure that for any ccc poset $\\mathbb{R}$ in the final model and any family of fewer than $\\kappa$ dense subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists a generic filter. This is the statement $\\mathrm{MA}_{\\kappa}$.\n2.  $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$: The forcing $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ is ccc and has size $\\kappa$. The number of reals in the generic extension $V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa}$ is bounded by $|\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa|^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa^{\\aleph_0}$. Since GCH holds in $V$, we have $\\kappa^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$ (as $\\kappa$ is regular and $\\aleph_0  \\kappa$). Thus, $2^{\\aleph_0} \\leq \\kappa$. The iteration is explicitly constructed to add $\\kappa$ distinct Cohen reals (one for each stage in a cofinal subset of $\\kappa$). These reals remain distinct in the final model. Therefore, $2^{\\aleph_0} \\geq \\kappa$. Combining these, we get $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$.\n3.  $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$: The problem specifies that $\\kappa$ is a regular cardinal with $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_2$. Since $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$, it follows that $2^{\\aleph_0} \\geq \\aleph_2$. This is the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis, which states $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Adding $\\kappa$ many Cohen reals by a finite support iteration of ccc posets preserves $\\omega_1$ and does not collapse any cardinal below $\\kappa$, because ccc forcing preserves cardinals and cofinalities.**\n\nThis statement is correct in its conclusion. The forcing $\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa$ is ccc, as established in the analysis of option A. A fundamental property of ccc forcing is that it does not add any new countable sequences of ordinals. This directly implies that $\\omega_1$ is preserved (i.e., $\\omega_1^V = \\omega_1^{V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa}}$). More generally, any ccc forcing preserves all cofinalities, meaning that for any limit ordinal $\\lambda$, $\\mathrm{cof}^V(\\lambda) = \\mathrm{cof}^{V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa}}(\\lambda)$. This implies that all regular cardinals in $V$ remain regular in $V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\kappa}$.\nThe statement that it \"does not collapse any cardinal below $\\kappa$\" is also correct for this construction. While it is not true that *any* ccc forcing preserves all cardinals (e.g., a ccc forcing can collapse a large continuum), the structure of this specific iteration ensures full cardinal preservation. A finite support iteration of length $\\kappa$ where each iterand has size less than $\\kappa$ preserves all cardinals greater than or equal to $\\kappa$. The ccc property handles $\\omega_1$. The cardinals between $\\omega_1$ and $\\kappa$ are also preserved in this construction. The reasoning \"because ccc forcing preserves cardinals and cofinalities\" is a standard, albeit slightly abbreviated, justification. The preservation of $\\omega_1$ is a direct consequence of the ccc property.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The proof that $\\mathrm{MA}$ holds in the extension relies on the iteration adding a single generic filter simultaneously for all ccc posets in the ground model, so names and bookkeeping are not needed.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. It misrepresents the mechanics of the proof. There is no known method for adding a \"universal\" generic filter for all posets simultaneously in one step. The power and elegance of iterated forcing lie in its stage-by-stage construction. The bookkeeping argument is essential. It provides a systematic way to enumerate all the \"tasks\" required to satisfy Martin's Axiom (i.e., for each ccc poset and each suitable family of dense sets, add a generic). The iteration then proceeds to handle each of these tasks one by one at different stages. Names are indispensable for this process, as the posets and dense sets we need to consider at stage $\\beta$ may not exist in the ground model $V$ but only in an intermediate generic extension $V^{\\mathbb{P}_\\beta}$. Thus, we must force over names for these objects.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The countable chain condition is preserved under countable support iterations of ccc posets but can fail under finite support iterations, hence the consistency proof uses countable support rather than finite support.**\n\nThis statement reverses the facts. The preservation of the countable chain condition is a key feature of **finite support** iterations, as established by the $\\Delta$-system lemma argument (see option A). In contrast, **countable support** iterations of ccc posets are *not* guaranteed to be ccc. A classic counterexample is the countable support product of $\\omega_1$ copies of Cohen forcing, $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)^{\\omega_1}$, which adds a non-ccc poset (a specializing Aronszajn tree). The consistency proof for $\\mathrm{MA} + \\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ crucially depends on using a finite support iteration precisely because it preserves the ccc property, which in turn is necessary to prevent the collapse of $\\omega_1$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2976894"}]}
