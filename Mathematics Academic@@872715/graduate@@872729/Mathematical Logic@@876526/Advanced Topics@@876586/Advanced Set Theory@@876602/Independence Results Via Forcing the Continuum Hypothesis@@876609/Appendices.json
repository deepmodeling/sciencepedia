This analysis is to be grounded in the foundational metatheorems of first-order logic.\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the relationship between the syntactic and semantic aspects of a formal theory.\n\n*   **Syntactic Notion (Derivability):** A sentence $\\varphi$ is derivable from a theory $T$, denoted $T \\vdash \\varphi$, if there exists a proof of $\\varphi$ from the axioms of $T$ using the rules of inference of first-order logic. A sentence $\\varphi$ is independent of $T$ if neither $T \\vdash \\varphi$ nor $T \\vdash \\neg \\varphi$. This is a purely formal concept dealing with sequences of symbols.\n\n*   **Semantic Notion (Truth in a Model):** A model of a theory $T$ is a mathematical structure $(M, \\in_M)$ where the axioms of $T$ are true under a specific interpretation. We write $M \\models \\psi$ to denote that the sentence $\\psi$ is true in the model $M$.\n\nA direct, \"purely syntactic\" proof of independence would require showing that no possible finite sequence of formulas constitutes a proof of $\\mathrm{CH}$ from $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, and likewise for $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$. For a theory as complex as $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, whose axioms include infinite schemes, the space of possible proofs is infinite and lacks sufficient structure to make such a direct negative demonstration feasible. There is no general algorithm for determining whether a sentence is provable in a theory like $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ (a consequence of the undecidability of first-order logic).\n\nThe bridge between the syntactic and semantic realms is provided by Gödel's Soundness and Completeness theorems for first-order logic.\n\n*   **Soundness Theorem:** If $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then for every model $M$ of $T$, it holds that $M \\models \\varphi$. (Provability implies truth in all models).\n*   **Completeness Theorem:** If for every model $M$ of $T$, it holds that $M \\models \\varphi$, then $T \\vdash \\varphi$. (Truth in all models implies provability).\n\nThese two theorems together establish that $T \\vdash \\varphi$ if and only if $\\varphi$ is true in all models of $T$. We can use this equivalence to rephrase the conditions for independence:\n\n1.  To show $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\nvdash \\neg \\mathrm{CH}$: We need to demonstrate that it is *not* the case that $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ is true in all models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. This is equivalent to finding at least one model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ in which $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ is false, i.e., a model $M_1$ such that $M_1 \\models \\mathrm{ZFC}$ and $M_1 \\models \\mathrm{CH}$. This is precisely what Gödel did by constructing the constructible universe, $L$, showing that if $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ is consistent, then $\\mathrm{ZFC} + \\mathrm{CH}$ is consistent. He showed that $L$ is a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC} + \\mathrm{V=L}$, and that $\\mathrm{V=L}$ implies $\\mathrm{GCH}$ (the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis), and thus $\\mathrm{CH}$.\n\n2.  To show $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\nvdash \\mathrm{CH}$: We need to demonstrate that it is *not* the case that $\\mathrm{CH}$ is true in all models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. This is equivalent to finding at least one model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ in which $\\mathrm{CH}$ is false, i.e., a model $M_2$ such that $M_2 \\models \\mathrm{ZFC}$ and $M_2 \\models \\neg \\mathrm{CH}$. This is what Paul Cohen did using the method of forcing. He showed that given a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, one can construct a new model (a \"forcing extension\") in which the axioms of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ still hold but $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ is true.\n\nIn summary, the model-theoretic approach is chosen because the Completeness Theorem transforms an intractable syntactic problem (exploring an infinite space of potential proofs) into a tractable, though highly sophisticated, semantic problem (constructing specific mathematical objects called models).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. By Gödel’s completeness theorem, for any first-order theory $T$ and sentence $\\varphi$, $T \\nvdash \\varphi$ if and only if $T \\cup \\{\\neg \\varphi\\}$ has a model, and $T \\nvdash \\neg \\varphi$ if and only if $T \\cup \\{\\varphi\\}$ has a model. Therefore, to establish independence of $\\mathrm{CH}$ from $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, it is necessary and sufficient (relative to consistency) to exhibit two models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ that disagree on $\\mathrm{CH}$.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the core logic. The equivalence \"$T \\nvdash \\varphi \\iff T \\cup \\{\\neg \\varphi\\}$ has a model\" is a direct and standard consequence of the Completeness Theorem. Applying this to both $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ for the theory $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ leads directly to the conclusion that independence is proven by finding two models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$: one where $\\mathrm{CH}$ is true (a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\cup \\{\\mathrm{CH}\\}$) and one where $\\mathrm{CH}$ is false (a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\cup \\{\\neg \\mathrm{CH}\\}$). The parenthetical \"relative to consistency\" correctly qualifies that these proofs demonstrate the consistency of $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ assuming $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ itself is consistent, which is the standard for such results.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The standard semantic route to independence combines Gödel’s construction of the inner model $L$ (in which $\\mathrm{CH}$ holds) with Cohen’s forcing method (which produces a forcing extension in which $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ holds). Together with soundness and completeness, this shows that syntactic non-derivability is witnessed by the existence of models with opposite truth values, explaining why model-building is central.**\nThis option correctly describes the historical and technical execution of the independence proof for $\\mathrm{CH}$. It accurately names the two key technical achievements: Gödel's constructible universe $L$ for a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\mathrm{CH}$, and Cohen's forcing for a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$. It then correctly links these specific model constructions back to the general principle: that via the metatheorems of soundness and completeness, the existence of these models is the very thing that demonstrates syntactic non-derivability. This explains *why* model-building is not just a theoretical possibility but the central and successful methodology in practice.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{CH}$ is not expressible in the first-order language of set theory, so purely syntactic methods in $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ cannot even state $\\mathrm{CH}$, making model-building the only available approach.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The Continuum Hypothesis, which posits $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$, is fully expressible as a sentence in the first-order language of set theory. The concepts of the set of natural numbers ($\\omega$), the power set operation ($P(x)$), cardinal equivalence (existence of a bijection), and the von Neumann ordinals (including $\\aleph_1$ as the first uncountable ordinal) are all definable within $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{CH}$ can be, and is, formulated as a first-order sentence. The premise of this option is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem states that any sufficiently strong consistent theory is incomplete, which directly implies that $\\mathrm{CH}$ is undecidable in $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ without needing models.**\nThis is a common misinterpretation of the Incompleteness Theorem. The theorem guarantees the *existence* of an undecidable statement for any sufficiently strong, consistent, and effectively axiomatized theory like $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. However, it does not identify any particular, mathematically natural statement (like $\\mathrm{CH}$) as being undecidable. The proof of the theorem constructs a specific, rather artificial sentence (the \"Gödel sentence\") that asserts its own unprovability. To show that a statement like $\\mathrm{CH}$ is independent requires a separate, dedicated proof. The Incompleteness Theorem only tells us that such independent statements exist, not which ones they are.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The compactness theorem ensures that if no finite subset of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ proves $\\mathrm{CH}$ or $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$, then $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ does not decide $\\mathrm{CH}$; thus one can establish undecidability by purely syntactic finite-fragment checks without constructing models.**\nThe Compactness Theorem's consequence for proofs is that if $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then some finite subset $T_0 \\subset T$ already yields $T_0 \\vdash \\varphi$. The contrapositive is that if no finite subset proves $\\varphi$, then the full theory $T$ does not prove $\\varphi$. While this is logically sound, it is not a practical method for proving independence. $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ is an infinite axiom scheme, leading to an infinite number of finite subsets to check. Furthermore, proving non-derivability from even a single finite set of axioms is generally intractable. This option misleadingly presents a theoretical consequence as a viable practical alternative to model building, which it is not. It fails to explain why model-building is the *chosen* method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2974070"}, {"introduction": "Forcing is a powerful tool for changing the universe of sets, but its precision comes from its ability to *preserve* large parts of the original structure.

For this definition to be non-trivial, it must be the case that $c \\neq 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, since if $c=0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, compatibility is impossible. This is a common and minor imprecision in mathematical statements where context implies such a restriction. Assuming this clarification, the definition given is equivalent to the standard definition of a \"homogeneous\" Boolean algebra. There are no scientific or logical contradictions in the setup. The problem is well-posed, objective, and complete enough to be solved.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the analysis of each option.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the consequences of the homogeneity of the forcing algebra $\\mathbb{B}$. The provided definition of \"weakly homogeneous\" is, under the reasonable interpretation of assuming $c \\neq 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, the standard definition of homogeneity for a Boolean algebra. This property asserts that the automorphism group $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbb{B})$ acts transitively on the non-zero elements of $\\mathbb{B}$ up to compatibility.\n\nA key result, often called the Homogeneity Lemma, states that if $\\mathbb{B}$ is homogeneous, then for any first-order formula $\\varphi(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ and any parameters $a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\in M$, the Boolean value of the statement $\\varphi(\\check{a}_1, \\ldots, \\check{a}_n)$, denoted $||\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})||$, must be either $0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ or $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$.\n\n**Proof Sketch:** Let $b = ||\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})||$. Assume for contradiction that $b \\neq 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ and $b \\neq 1_{\\mathbb{B}}$. Then its Boolean complement, $\\neg b = ||\\neg\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})||$, is also non-zero. Since $b \\neq 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, there exists a non-zero condition $p \\in \\mathbb{B}$ such that $p \\le b$. By homogeneity, for the non-zero conditions $p$ and $\\neg b$, there exists an automorphism $\\pi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbb{B})$ such that $\\pi(p)$ is compatible with $\\neg b$. Let $r = \\pi(p) \\wedge \\neg b$; then $r \\neq 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$.\nFrom $p \\le b$, we have $p \\Vdash \\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$. By the automorphism property of forcing, $\\pi(p) \\Vdash \\varphi(\\pi(\\check{\\vec{a}}))$. Since $\\vec{a} \\in M$, the canonical names $\\check{\\vec{a}}$ are fixed by any automorphism, so $\\pi(\\check{\\vec{a}}) = \\check{\\vec{a}}$. Thus, $\\pi(p) \\Vdash \\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$.\nSince $r \\le \\pi(p)$, we have $r \\Vdash \\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$.\nHowever, since $r \\le \\neg b$, we also have $r \\Vdash \\neg\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$.\nA non-zero condition $r$ cannot force a statement and its negation. This implies $r = 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, which contradicts our finding that $r \\neq 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false, and either $b = 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ or $b = 1_{\\mathbb{B}}$.\n\nWith this lemma, we can now evaluate the options.\n\n**Option A: If $\\mathbb{B}$ is weakly homogeneous, then for every sentence $\\varphi$ in the language of set theory with parameters from $M$, either $1_{\\mathbb{B}} \\Vdash \\varphi$ or $1_{\\mathbb{B}} \\Vdash \\neg \\varphi$.**\n\nThis statement is a direct reformulation of the Homogeneity Lemma. A sentence $\\varphi$ with parameters from $M$ corresponds to a formula $\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$ in the forcing language. The lemma states its Boolean value, $||\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})||$, is $0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ or $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$.\n-   If $||\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})|| = 1_{\\mathbb{B}}$, this is equivalent to $1_{\\mathbb{B}} \\Vdash \\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$.\n-   If $||\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})|| = 0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, this means $||\\neg\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})|| = \\neg 0_{\\mathbb{B}} = 1_{\\mathbb{B}}$, which is equivalent to $1_{\\mathbb{B}} \\Vdash \\neg\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})$.\nThus, the statement is a correct consequence of homogeneity.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B: If $\\mathbb{P}$ is weakly homogeneous, then for any two $M$-generic filters $G$ and $H$, the structures $M[G]$ and $M[H]$ are elementarily equivalent in the full language of set theory even when allowing parameters from $M[G]$ that are not in $M$.**\n\nThis option is incorrect. First, it refers to \"weakly homogeneous $\\mathbb{P}$,\" a term not defined in the problem. Assuming it means that the Boolean completion $\\mathbb{B}$ is weakly homogeneous, the conclusion is still false. Homogeneity only guarantees elementary equivalence for sentences with parameters from the ground model $M$. It does not guarantee full elementary equivalence, which would allow parameters from the generic extension itself.\nFor example, consider Cohen forcing $\\mathbb{P} = \\operatorname{Fn}(\\omega, 2)$, which is homogeneous. Let $G$ and $H$ be two distinct $M$-generic filters. They produce two distinct Cohen reals, $c_G \\in M[G]$ and $c_H \\in M[H]$. The statement \"the $n$-th bit of the generic real is $0$\" can be true in $M[G]$ for some $n \\in \\omega$ (using $c_G$ as a parameter) while being false in $M[H]$ (using $c_H$ as a parameter), but this does not show the models are not elementarily equivalent. More pointedly, there can exist sentences with parameters from the extension that distinguish the models. For instance, if $M$ is countable, the set of reals of $M[G]$ is not necessarily elementarily equivalent to the set of reals of $M[H]$. This statement is a known over-generalization of the consequences of homogeneity.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C: In the homogeneity-based argument, automorphisms of $\\mathbb{B}$ can be used to carry any condition $p$ and any $M$-name $\\dot{\\tau}$ to $\\pi(p)$ and $\\pi(\\dot{\\tau})$ so that forcing is preserved and $\\pi(p)$ can be made compatible with an arbitrary condition $q$, which yields that the Boolean value of $\\varphi(\\check{a})$ is determined by $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$ for every $a \\in M$.**\n\nThis statement describes the structure of the proof of the Homogeneity Lemma (and thus, of statement A).\n1.  \"automorphisms of $\\mathbb{B}$ can be used to carry any condition $p$ and any $M$-name $\\dot{\\tau}$ to $\\pi(p)$ and $\\pi(\\dot{\\tau})$ so that forcing is preserved\": This is a correct statement of the automorphism property of the forcing relation.\n2.  \"and $\\pi(p)$ can be made compatible with an arbitrary condition $q$\": This is a correct statement of the homogeneity property (assuming $p,q$ are non-zero).\n3.  \"which yields that the Boolean value of $\\varphi(\\check{a})$ is determined by $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$\": This correctly identifies the conclusion of the argument for sentences with ground model parameters. The phrase \"determined by $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$\" is slightly informal, but in this context, it clearly means that the Boolean value must be one of the two values definable from $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$ alone, namely $0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ and $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$.\nThe statement correctly links the premises (automorphism invariance, homogeneity) to the conclusion (the 0-1 law for Boolean values). The inclusion of a general name $\\dot{\\tau}$ in the first clause is part of a general principle, which is then applied to the specific case of names $\\check{a}$ to get the result. The overall description of the argument is sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option D: Homogeneity of $\\mathbb{B}$ is necessary and sufficient for: for every two $M$-generic filters $G$ and $H$ and every formula $\\varphi(\\vec{a})$ with $\\vec{a} \\in M$, one has $M[G] \\models \\varphi(\\vec{a})$ if and only if $M[H] \\models \\varphi(\\vec{a})$.**\n\nThis statement makes a claim of both sufficiency and necessity.\n-   **Sufficiency**: As shown in the analysis for option A, homogeneity implies that for any $\\varphi(\\vec{a})$, $||\\varphi(\\check{\\vec{a}})||$ is either $0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ or $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$. If it is $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$, then $M[G] \\models \\varphi(\\vec{a})$ for all generic $G$. If it is $0_{\\mathbb{B}}$, then $M[G] \\models \\neg\\varphi(\\vec{a})$ for all $G$. In either case, the truth value is constant across all generic extensions. So, homogeneity is a sufficient condition.\n-   **Necessity**: This direction states that if all generic extensions are elementarily equivalent over $M$, then $\\mathbb{B}$ must be homogeneous. The proof of this direction is significantly more advanced. It requires showing that if $\\mathbb{B}$ is not homogeneous, one can construct a sentence with parameters from $M$ whose Boolean value is not $0_{\\mathbb{B}}$ or $1_{\\mathbb{B}}$. This in turn depends on a \"Definability Lemma\" which asserts that certain automorphism-invariant elements of $\\mathbb{B}$ are the Boolean values of some formulas. The validity of this lemma for a general transitive model $M$ of ZFC is not guaranteed; it holds for \"nice\" models (e.g., countable transitive models, or models of the form $H_\\kappa$). Since the problem only assumes $M$ is a transitive model of ZFC, without these additional properties, necessity cannot be established. A meticulous analysis must acknowledge that this standard textbook equivalence has prerequisites on the ground model $M$ that are not stated.\nTherefore, the claim that homogeneity is *necessary* is not true in this full generality.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E: For a fixed homogeneous forcing notion $\\mathbb{P}$, the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) has the same truth value in $M[G]$ for all $M$-generic filters $G \\subseteq \\mathbb{P}$ over the same ground model $M$.**\n\nThe statement of the Continuum Hypothesis, $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$, is a sentence in the language of set theory. It has no free variables and its constants (like $\\omega$ or cardinals) are definable. Therefore, it is a sentence $\\varphi$ with an empty set of parameters from $M$. We assume \"homogeneous forcing notion $\\mathbb{P}$\" means its Boolean completion $\\mathbb{B}$ is homogeneous. As established in the analysis of option A, the homogeneity of $\\mathbb{B}$ implies that for any such sentence, its truth value must be the same across all generic extensions $M[G]$. Either $1_{\\mathbb{B}} \\Vdash \\text{CH}$ (in which case CH is true in all $M[G]$) or $1_{\\mathbb{B}} \\Vdash \\neg\\text{CH}$ (in which case CH is false in all $M[G]$).

The two extensions are generated by a finite-support product and a finite-support iteration of Cohen forcing, respectively.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- $\\mathbf{V}$ is a transitive model of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC).\n- The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) holds in $\\mathbf{V}$.\n- $\\kappa$ is an uncountable cardinal such that $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_{1}$.\n- The base forcing notion is Cohen forcing, $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$, consisting of finite partial functions from $\\omega$ to $2$, ordered by reverse inclusion.\n- The first forcing notion is the finite-support product $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}=\\prod_{\\xi\\kappa}^{\\mathrm{FS}}\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi}$.\n- The second forcing notion is the finite-support iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ of length $\\kappa$ of $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$.\n- $G_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ is a $\\mathbf{V}$-generic filter for $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, and $G_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is a $\\mathbf{V}$-generic filter for $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$.\n- The task is to find the value of $2^{\\omega}$ in the generic extensions $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$ and $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-defined within the standard framework of ZFC set theory and forcing.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The concepts used—ZFC, GCH, Cohen forcing, finite-support products and iterations, and generic extensions—are all standard, rigorously defined topics in mathematical logic and set theory. The question about the value of the continuum in a forcing extension is a central topic in the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem statement is precise. The forcing notions are standard constructions. The value of $2^{\\omega}$ in a model of ZFC is a well-defined cardinal, so a unique solution is expected to exist.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in formal mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained. The assumption of GCH in the ground model is a critical piece of information that is provided and is essential for the cardinality calculations. The condition $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_{1}$ is also explicit. There are no contradictions.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or outside the scope of mathematical proof. It is a standard, albeit advanced, exercise in the theory of forcing.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe will analyze the two forcing notions, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ and $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$, separately. The core of the argument relies on determining the size and the chain condition of each poset.\n\n**Preliminaries**\n\n1.  **Cohen Forcing $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$:** The set of conditions is the set of all finite partial functions $p: \\omega \\to 2$. The size of this set is $|\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)| = \\aleph_{0}$. It is a standard result that $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$ satisfies the countable chain condition (ccc), meaning every antichain in $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$ is countable.\n\n2.  **Cardinal Arithmetic with GCH:** The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) states that $2^{\\aleph_{\\alpha}} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$ for all ordinals $\\alpha$. A consequence of GCH that is crucial for our analysis is its impact on cardinal exponentiation. For any infinite cardinals $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, GCH implies $\\lambda^{\\mu} = \\lambda$ if $\\mu  \\mathrm{cf}(\\lambda)$ and $2^{\\mu} \\le \\lambda$, and $\\lambda^{\\mu} = 2^{\\mu}$ if $\\lambda \\le 2^{\\mu}$. A simpler consequence is that for any infinite cardinal $\\lambda$, $\\lambda^{\\aleph_0} = \\max(\\lambda, 2^{\\aleph_0})$. Since GCH holds in $\\mathbf{V}$, $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$. The problem states $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_1$. Therefore, in $\\mathbf{V}$, we have $(\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\max(\\kappa, \\aleph_1) = \\kappa$.\n\n**Part 1: The Finite-Support Product $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$**\n\n1.  **Cardinality of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$:** A condition in $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ is a function $p$ defined on a finite subset of $\\kappa$ (its support), where for each $\\xi$ in the support, $p(\\xi)$ is a non-trivial condition in $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi}$. The total set of conditions can be expressed as a union over all possible finite supports:\n    $$ \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}} = \\bigcup_{S \\in [\\kappa]^{\\omega}} \\prod_{\\xi \\in S} \\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi} $$\n    The number of finite subsets of $\\kappa$ is $|[\\kappa]^{\\omega}| = \\kappa$. For any finite support $S$ with $|S|=n$, the number of conditions on that support is $|\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)|^{n} = \\aleph_{0}^{n} = \\aleph_{0}$.\n    Thus, the total number of conditions is $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}| = |[\\kappa]^{\\omega}| \\cdot \\aleph_{0} = \\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa$.\n\n2.  **Chain Condition of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$:** It is a standard theorem that a finite-support product of ccc posets is ccc, provided that the ground model satisfies certain cardinal arithmetic properties. Specifically, if $\\mathbb{P}_\\xi$ is ccc for all $\\xi  \\kappa$, then $\\prod_{\\xi\\kappa}^{\\mathrm{FS}}\\mathbb{P}_\\xi$ is ccc if $(\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa$. As established in the preliminaries, GCH and $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_1$ ensure that $(\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa$. Since each factor $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi}$ is ccc, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ is ccc.\n\n3.  **Value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$:**\n    -   **Upper Bound:** Forcing with a ccc poset preserves cardinals. Any new subset of $\\omega$ in the extension $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$ corresponds to a \"name\" in $\\mathbf{V}$. The number of such subsets is bounded by the number of nice names for subsets of $\\omega$. This number is in turn bounded by $(|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}}$.\n        $$ (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]} \\leq (|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = (\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa $$\n    -   **Lower Bound:** The forcing $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ adds, for each $\\xi  \\kappa$, a generic function $g_{\\xi}: \\omega \\to 2$. These functions are distinct for distinct $\\xi$. This is because for any $\\xi \\neq \\zeta$, the set of conditions that force $g_{\\xi}(n) \\neq g_{\\zeta}(n)$ for some $n$ is dense. Consequently, in the generic extension $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$, there exists an injection from $\\kappa$ into the set of real numbers $2^{\\omega}$. This implies:\n        $$ \\kappa \\leq (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]} $$\n    -   **Conclusion for $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$:** Combining the upper and lower bounds, by the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem, we conclude that $(2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]} = \\kappa$.\n\n**Part 2: The Finite-Support Iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$**\n\n1.  **Cardinality of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$:** The forcing $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is the finite-support iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}$ of length $\\kappa$, where at each stage $\\alpha  \\kappa$, the iterand $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$ is a name for $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$. A standard result on the cardinality of finite-support iterations states that if $|\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}|$ is forced to be at most $\\lambda$ for all $\\alpha  \\kappa$, then $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}| \\leq (\\kappa \\cdot \\lambda)^{\\aleph_0}$. In our case, $1 \\Vdash_{\\alpha} |\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}| = \\aleph_{0}$, so we can take $\\lambda = \\aleph_{0}$. Thus, $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}| \\leq (\\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0)^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$. The inequality $\\kappa \\leq |\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}|$ is clear, as for each $\\alpha  \\kappa$ we can construct distinct conditions supported only at $\\{\\alpha\\}$. Therefore, $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}| = \\kappa$.\n\n2.  **Chain Condition of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$:** A fundamental theorem of forcing states that any finite-support iteration of ccc posets is ccc. That is, if for every $\\alpha  \\kappa$, it is forced that $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$ is ccc (i.e., $1_{\\alpha} \\Vdash_{\\mathbb{P}_{\\alpha}} \"\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha} \\text{ is ccc}\"$), then the iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}$ is ccc. In our case, each $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$ is a name for $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$, which is ccc. This property is absolute, so the condition holds. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is ccc.\n\n3.  **Value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$:** The argument is identical to the one for the product forcing.\n    -   **Upper Bound:** Since $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is a ccc poset of size $\\kappa$, the number of new reals added is bounded by $(|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}}$.\n        $$ (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]} \\leq (|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = (\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa $$\n    -   **Lower Bound:** The iteration adds a new Cohen real at each stage $\\alpha  \\kappa$. Let $g_{\\alpha}$ be the Cohen real added by the forcing $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$. These reals $\\{g_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha  \\kappa\\}$ form a set of size $\\kappa$ in the final model $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$. This provides an injection from $\\kappa$ to $2^{\\omega}$.\n        $$ \\kappa \\leq (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]} $$\n    -   **Conclusion for $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$:** Combining the bounds, we conclude that $(2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]} = \\kappa$.\n\n**Final Summary**\nBoth the finite-support product and the finite-support iteration of $\\kappa$ copies of Cohen forcing result in generic extensions where the value of the continuum is $\\kappa$. For both forcing notions, the key properties are that they have cardinality $\\kappa$, they satisfy the countable chain condition (ccc), and they add $\\kappa$ new Cohen reals. These properties, combined with the GCH in the ground model, uniquely determine the value of $2^{\\omega}$ in the extensions.\n\nThe value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$ is $a=\\kappa$.\nThe value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$ is $b=\\kappa$.\nThe final answer is presented as the row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\kappa  \\kappa\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2974076"}]}
