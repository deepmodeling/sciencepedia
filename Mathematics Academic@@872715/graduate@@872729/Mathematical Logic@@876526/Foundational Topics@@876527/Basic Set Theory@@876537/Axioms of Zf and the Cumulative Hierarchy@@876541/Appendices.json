The process will be conducted in two main stages: first, determining the transitive closure of the given set, and second, computing the rank of the resulting set. All steps will be justified based on the provided definitions.\n\nLet the given set be denoted by $S$. The problem statement defines this set as $S = \\{\\{0\\},\\{0,1\\},\\{0,1,2\\}\\}$.\nThe problem specifies that the numerals $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ should be interpreted as von Neumann ordinals. The definitions are provided as:\n$0 = \\emptyset$\n$1 = \\{0\\} = \\{\\emptyset\\}$\n$2 = \\{0, 1\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}$\n$3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\} = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}, \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\}$\n\nUsing these definitions, we can express the elements of the set $S$ in terms of ordinals:\n- The first element of $S$ is $\\{0\\}$, which is the definition of the ordinal $1$.\n- The second element of $S$ is $\\{0,1\\}$, which is the definition of the ordinal $2$.\n- The third element of $S$ is $\\{0,1,2\\}$, which is the definition of the ordinal $3$.\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ can be written as $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The problem is now to compute $\\rho(\\operatorname{TC}(\\{1, 2, 3\\}))$.\n\nFirst, we compute the transitive closure, $\\operatorname{TC}(S)$. The transitive closure of a set $x$, denoted $\\operatorname{TC}(x)$, is defined as the least transitive set containing $x$. A set $A$ is transitive if for every element $y \\in A$, it holds that $y \\subseteq A$.\n\nWe seek the smallest transitive set, let us call it $T$, such that $S \\subseteq T$.\nThe condition $S \\subseteq T$ means $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\subseteq T$.\nThis implies, in particular, that $3 \\in T$.\nSince $T$ must be a transitive set, the definition of transitivity requires that every element of $T$ must also be a subset of $T$. As $3 \\in T$, it must be that $3 \\subseteq T$.\nThe von Neumann ordinal $3$ is the set $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. So, the condition $3 \\subseteq T$ implies that $\\{0, 1, 2\\} \\subseteq T$.\nThis means that $0 \\in T$, $1 \\in T$, and $2 \\in T$.\n\nCombining the initial requirement that $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\subseteq T$ with the derived consequence that $\\{0, 1, 2\\} \\subseteq T$, we conclude that any transitive set $T$ containing $S$ must satisfy $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\subseteq T$.\n\nNow, let us examine the set $X = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This set is, by definition, the von Neumann ordinal $4$.\nWe must check if $X=4$ is a transitive set. A fundamental property of von Neumann ordinals is that every ordinal is a transitive set. To see this for an ordinal $\\alpha$, let $\\beta \\in \\alpha$. An element $\\gamma \\in \\beta$ implies $\\gamma  \\beta$ in the ordering of ordinals. Since $\\beta \\in \\alpha$ implies $\\beta  \\alpha$, the transitivity of the ordinal ordering gives $\\gamma  \\alpha$, which means $\\gamma \\in \\alpha$. Thus, every element of $\\beta$ is an element of $\\alpha$, so $\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha$. This holds for all $\\beta \\in \\alpha$, so $\\alpha$ is a transitive set. Consequently, $4$ is a transitive set.\n\nWe have established that any transitive set containing $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ must contain $4=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ as a subset. Since $4$ is itself a transitive set containing $S$, it must be the *least* such set.\nTherefore, the transitive closure of $S$ is the ordinal $4$:\n$\\operatorname{TC}(S) = \\operatorname{TC}(\\{1, 2, 3\\}) = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} = 4$.\n\nSecond, we compute the rank of this resulting set, i.e., $\\rho(4)$.\nThe rank function $\\rho$ is defined recursively on the cumulative hierarchy by the formula:\n$\\rho(x) = \\sup\\{\\rho(y) + 1 : y \\in x\\}$.\n\nFor any ordinal $\\alpha$, it can be proven by transfinite induction that $\\rho(\\alpha) = \\alpha$.\nBase case: $\\rho(0) = \\rho(\\emptyset) = \\sup\\{\\rho(y) + 1 : y \\in \\emptyset\\} = \\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$.\nInductive step: Assume $\\rho(\\beta) = \\beta$ for all ordinals $\\beta  \\alpha$. Since the elements of an ordinal $\\alpha$ are precisely the ordinals smaller than it, we have:\n$\\rho(\\alpha) = \\sup\\{\\rho(\\beta) + 1 : \\beta \\in \\alpha\\} = \\sup\\{\\beta + 1 : \\beta  \\alpha\\}$.\nThe supremum of the set of successor ordinals less than or equal to $\\beta+1$ for all $\\beta  \\alpha$ is $\\alpha$ itself.\nFor example, $\\rho(3) = \\sup\\{\\rho(0)+1, \\rho(1)+1, \\rho(2)+1\\} = \\sup\\{0+1, 1+1, 2+1\\} = \\sup\\{1,2,3\\} = 3$.\n\nApplying this property to our result, we seek $\\rho(4)$. Since $4$ is an ordinal, its rank is equal to itself.\n$\\rho(4) = 4$.\n\nTo be fully rigorous and cross-check, we can apply the rank definition directly to the set $4 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$\\rho(4) = \\sup\\{\\rho(y) + 1 : y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\}$\n$\\rho(4) = \\sup\\{\\rho(0)+1, \\rho(1)+1, \\rho(2)+1, \\rho(3)+1\\}$\nUsing the property $\\rho(\\alpha) = \\alpha$:\n$\\rho(4) = \\sup\\{0+1, 1+1, 2+1, 3+1\\}$\n$\\rho(4) = \\sup\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$\nThe supremum of the set of natural numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ is $4$.\n\nThus, the rank of the transitive closure of the set $\\{\\{0\\},\\{0,1\\},\\{0,1,2\\}\\}$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2968729"}]}
