Arithmetic on ordinals exhibits properties that are distinct from standard arithmetic on integers.\n\n**Background:**\n- **Ordinal Addition:** For ordinals $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the sum $\\alpha+\\beta$ is the order type of the disjoint union of a set of order type $\\alpha$ and a set of order type $\\beta$, where every element of the first set is defined to be smaller than every element of the second set. This operation is associative but not commutative. For example, $1+\\omega=\\omega$, but $\\omega+1  \\omega$.\n- **Ordinal Multiplication:** The product $\\alpha\\cdot\\beta$ is the order type of the Cartesian product of two sets with order types $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, ordered anti-lexicographically (also known as reverse lexicographical order). This operation is associative and left-distributive over addition, i.e., $\\alpha(\\beta+\\gamma) = \\alpha\\beta+\\alpha\\gamma$, but it is not right-distributive or commutative. For example, $2\\cdot\\omega = \\omega$, but $\\omega\\cdot 2 = \\omega+\\omega$.\n- **Cantor Normal Form:** Any ordinal $\\alpha  0$ can be uniquely written as a finite sum $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\beta_1}c_1 + \\omega^{\\beta_2}c_2 + \\dots + \\omega^{\\beta_k}c_k$, where $\\beta_1  \\beta_2  \\dots  \\beta_k \\ge 0$ are ordinals and $c_1, \\dots, c_k$ are positive integers.\n- A useful property for calculations involving the limit ordinal $\\omega$ is that for any ordinal $\\delta  0$ and finite ordinal (natural number) $n0$, we have $(\\delta+n)\\cdot\\omega = \\delta \\cdot \\omega$. In particular, for positive integers $k,m$, we have $(\\omega \\cdot k + m) \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^2$.\n\n**The Ordinal Division Algorithm (Right Division):**\nGiven any two ordinals $\\alpha$ (the dividend) and $\\beta  0$ (the divisor), there exist unique ordinals $\\gamma$ (the quotient) and $\\rho$ (the remainder) such that:\n$$ \\alpha = \\beta \\cdot \\gamma + \\rho $$\nand $\\rho  \\beta$.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nLet the dividend be the ordinal $\\alpha = \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 3 + 1$ and the divisor be the ordinal $\\beta = \\omega \\cdot 5 + 4$. Using the ordinal division algorithm, determine the unique quotient $\\gamma$ and remainder $\\rho$. Your answer should be the ordered pair $(\\gamma, \\rho)$.", "solution": "1.
