The final answer must be a simplified fraction.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- The problem is **scientifically grounded** in classical propositional logic, a fundamental area of mathematical logic. All definitions are standard and correct.\n- The problem is **well-posed**. It asks for a specific set of valuations and a probability, both of which can be uniquely determined from the provided information.\n- The problem is **objective**, stated in formal mathematical language without ambiguity or opinion.\n- The problem is **self-contained and consistent**. All necessary logical definitions are provided.\n- The problem does not violate any other validation criteria. It is a standard exercise in logical analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe formula is an implication of the form $A \\to B$, where the antecedent is $A = (p\\lor q)\\land(\\neg p\\lor r)$ and the consequent is $B = (q\\lor r)$.\nWe want to find the set of valuations $v$ for which $v(F) = 0$. Based on the definition of the material conditional, a formula $A \\to B$ is false if and only if the antecedent $A$ is true and the consequent $B$ is false.\nTherefore, we are looking for valuations $v$ such that:\n1. $v((p\\lor q)\\land(\\neg p\\lor r)) = 1$\n2. $v(q\\lor r) = 0$\n\nLet's analyze the second condition first, as it is simpler. For a disjunction to be false, both of its disjuncts must be false.\nFrom $v(q\\lor r) = 0$, we must have:\n$v(q) = 0$ and $v(r) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's use these necessary conditions in the first main condition, $v((p\\lor q)\\land(\\neg p\\lor r)) = 1$. For a conjunction to be true, both of its conjuncts must be true. This gives us two sub-conditions:\n2a. $v(p\\lor q) = 1$\n2b. $v(\\neg p\\lor r) = 1$\n\nWe substitute the values we found for $v(q)$ and $v(r)$ into these sub-conditions.\n\nFor sub-condition 2a:\n$v(p\\lor q) = 1$\nSubstituting $v(q)=0$, we get $v(p\\lor 0) = 1$.\nFor this disjunction to be true, at least one disjunct must be true. Since the second disjunct is $0$, the first must be $1$.\nThus, we must have $v(p) = 1$.\n\nFor sub-condition 2b:\n$v(\\neg p\\lor r) = 1$\nSubstituting $v(r)=0$, we get $v(\\neg p\\lor 0) = 1$.\nSimilarly, for this disjunction to be true, we must have $v(\\neg p) = 1$.\nBy the definition of negation, if $v(\\neg p) = 1$, then $v(p) = 0$.\n\nSo, for the formula $F$ to be false, the valuation $v$ must satisfy the following simultaneously:\n- $v(q) = 0$\n- $v(r) = 0$\n- $v(p) = 1$ (from condition 2a)\n- $v(p) = 0$ (from condition 2b)\n\nThe requirement that $v(p)=1$ and $v(p)=0$ is a contradiction. A propositional variable cannot be assigned both true and false under the same valuation. Therefore, there exists no valuation $v$ that can satisfy all the necessary conditions for $v(F)=0$. The set of valuations for which $v(F)=0$ is the empty set.\n\nBased on this derivation, we can decide whether $F$ is a tautology. A formula is a tautology if it evaluates to $1$ for every possible valuation. Since there are no valuations for which $F$ evaluates to $0$, and a valuation must map any formula to either $0$ or $1$, it must be the case that $F$ evaluates to $1$ for all valuations. Thus, $F$ is a tautology. This logical structure is known as the resolution rule in logic.\n\nFinally, we compute the probability that $F$ is false. There are three propositional variables, $p$, $q$, and $r$, each of which can take one of two values ($0$ or $1$). The total number of distinct valuations is $2^3 = 8$. The problem states that these valuations are under a uniform distribution.\n\nThe probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is \"$F$ is false\", which corresponds to a valuation $v$ making $v(F)=0$.\nLet $S$ be the set of all $8$ valuations. Let $E$ be the event that $F$ is false. The number of outcomes in $E$ is the number of valuations $v$ such that $v(F)=0$.\nAs we have shown, there are no such valuations. So, the size of the set of favorable outcomes is $|E|=0$.\nThe total number of outcomes is $|S|=8$.\nThe probability of $E$ is given by $P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|}$.\n$P(F \\text{ is false}) = \\frac{0}{8} = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is required as a simplified fraction.

First, we must simplify the given propositional formula $\\Phi_{n}$ to find two other syntactically distinct but logically equivalent formulas, $\\Psi_{n}$ and $\\Omega_{n}$, using only the specified laws. Second, we must calculate the number of truth assignments that make $\\Phi_{n}$ true.\n\n**Part 1: Simplification of $\\Phi_{n}$**\n\nThe given formula is:\n$$ \\Phi_{n} \\;=\\; \\left( z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \\big( x_{i} \\lor (x_{i} \\land y_{i}) \\big) \\right) \\;\\land\\; \\left( z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \\big( x_{i} \\lor y_{i} \\big) \\right) $$\n\nLet's begin by simplifying the sub-expressions within $\\Phi_{n}$. The term $\\big( x_{i} \\lor (x_{i} \\land y_{i}) \\big)$ inside the first major conjunct matches the structure of the absorption law $p \\lor (p \\land q) \\equiv p$, with $p$ as $x_{i}$ and $q$ as $y_{i}$. Applying this law for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we get:\n$$ x_{i} \\lor (x_{i} \\land y_{i}) \\equiv x_{i} $$\nSubstituting this result into the formula for $\\Phi_{n}$ yields a logically equivalent formula. Let us call this first simplified formula $\\Psi_n$:\n$$ \\Psi_{n} \\;=\\; \\left( z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\right) \\;\\land\\; \\left( z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \\big( x_{i} \\lor y_{i} \\big) \\right) $$\nThis formula $\\Psi_{n}$ is logically equivalent to $\\Phi_{n}$ and is syntactically distinct from it. This satisfies the requirement for one of the two formulas.\n\nNow, we simplify $\\Psi_{n}$ further. The structure of $\\Psi_{n}$ matches the distributive law $(p \\lor q) \\land (p \\lor r) \\equiv p \\lor (q \\land r)$. We can identify the components as:\n- $p \\equiv z$\n- $q \\equiv \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$\n- $r \\equiv \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} ( x_{i} \\lor y_{i} )$\n\nApplying this distributive law to $\\Psi_{n}$ gives:\n$$ \\Psi_{n} \\equiv z \\lor \\left( \\left( \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} \\lor y_{i}) \\right) \\right) $$\nBy the associativity and commutativity of the conjunction operator $\\land$, we can combine the two large conjunctions into one:\n$$ z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} \\left( x_{i} \\land (x_{i} \\lor y_{i}) \\right) $$\nNow, consider the term inside the conjunction, $x_{i} \\land (x_{i} \\lor y_{i})$. This matches the form of the second absorption law, $p \\land (p \\lor q) \\equiv p$, with $p$ as $x_i$ and $q$ as $y_i$. Applying this law, we get:\n$$ x_{i} \\land (x_{i} \\lor y_{i}) \\equiv x_{i} $$\nSubstituting this back into our expression, we obtain the simplest logically equivalent formula. Let us call this formula $\\Omega_{n}$:\n$$ \\Omega_{n} \\;=\\; z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} $$\nThis formula $\\Omega_{n}$ is logically equivalent to both $\\Phi_{n}$ and $\\Psi_{n}$, and is syntactically distinct from both. Thus, we have found two formulas, $\\Psi_n$ and $\\Omega_n$, that satisfy the conditions of the first task.\n\n**Part 2: Counting Satisfying Assignments**\n\nTo find the number of truth assignments that satisfy $\\Phi_{n}$, we can equivalently count the number of assignments that satisfy the simplified formula $\\Omega_{n}$.\nThe formula is $\\Omega_{n} = z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$.\nThe total number of propositional variables in the problem is $2n+1$: one variable $z$, $n$ variables $x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}$, and $n$ variables $y_{1}, \\dots, y_{n}$. The total number of possible truth assignments is $2^{2n+1}$.\n\nThe truth value of $\\Omega_{n}$ depends only on the variables $z, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}$. The variables $y_{1}, \\dots, y_{n}$ do not appear in $\\Omega_{n}$. This means that for any truth assignment to $(z, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n})$ that satisfies $\\Omega_n$, the formula remains satisfied regardless of the truth values assigned to $(y_{1}, \\dots, y_{n})$. There are $n$ such variables, so there are $2^n$ possible assignments for them.\n\nOur strategy will be to count the number of satisfying assignments for $\\Omega_n$ over the $n+1$ variables it depends on, and then multiply this count by $2^n$ to account for the \"don't care\" variables $y_i$.\n\nLet's count the number of falsifying assignments for $\\Omega_n$ over the variables $z, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n}$. A disjunction is false if and only if both of its disjuncts are false. Therefore, $\\Omega_n = z \\lor \\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$ is false if and only if:\n1.  $z$ must be false. There is 1 choice for the truth value of $z$.\n2.  $\\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$ must be false. This conjunction is true only in the single case where all $x_{i}$ are true ($x_1=1, x_2=1, \\dots, x_n=1$). The total number of assignments for the $n$ variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ is $2^n$. Therefore, the number of assignments for which the conjunction is false is $2^n - 1$.\n\nThe number of falsifying assignments for the variables $(z, x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is the product of the number of choices for each part: $1 \\times (2^n - 1) = 2^n - 1$.\nThe total number of truth assignments for these $n+1$ variables is $2^{n+1}$.\nThe number of satisfying assignments for $(z, x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is the total number of assignments minus the number of falsifying assignments:\n$$ N'_{\\text{sat}} = 2^{n+1} - (2^n - 1) = 2 \\cdot 2^n - 2^n + 1 = 2^n + 1 $$\nNow, we must account for the $n$ variables $y_1, \\dots, y_n$, which can take any truth value. For each of the $N'_{\\text{sat}}$ satisfying assignments for $(z, x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, there are $2^n$ possible assignments for $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$.\nTherefore, the total number of satisfying assignments for $\\Phi_n$ is:\n$$ N_{\\text{sat}} = N'_{\\text{sat}} \\times 2^n = (2^n + 1) \\times 2^n = 2^{2n} + 2^n $$\nThis can also be written as $4^n + 2^n$.

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of a limit $L$ that compares the asymptotic costs of two proof methods—truth tables and semantic tableaux—for a specific family of tautological formulas $\\{F_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$. The derivation requires finding closed-form expressions for the cost measures $T_n$ and $A_n$.\n\nFirst, we determine the cost $T_n$ of the truth-table method. The formula $F_n$ is constructed using $n$ distinct propositional variables, $\\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$. A valuation is a function that assigns a truth value (True or False) to each of these variables. Since each of the $n$ variables can independently take one of two truth values, the total number of distinct valuations is $2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2$ ($n$ times), which is $2^n$. The truth-table method for checking if a formula is a tautology requires evaluating the formula for every possible valuation of its variables. Thus, we must examine all $2^n$ valuations.\nThe number of rows in the truth table, which corresponds to the number of valuations to check, is therefore:\n$$\nT_n = 2^n\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the cost $A_n$ of the analytic tableau method. This cost is defined as the minimal number of rule applications required to close a semantic tableau for the negation of the formula, $\\lnot F_n$. We begin by analyzing the structure of $\\lnot F_n$.\nThe formula $F_n$ is defined by the recurrence:\n$$\nF_1 := p_1 \\lor \\lnot p_1, \\quad F_k := F_{k-1} \\land (p_k \\lor \\lnot p_k) \\text{ for } k \\geq 2\n$$\nThe negation of $F_n$ for $n \\geq 2$ is:\n$$\n\\lnot F_n = \\lnot \\left(F_{n-1} \\land (p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n)\\right)\n$$\nThe main connective is a negated conjunction, which corresponds to a $\\beta$-rule in the tableau method. Applying this rule expands the tableau into two branches. This constitutes one rule application.\nThe root of the tableau for $\\lnot F_n$ is expanded as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\lnot (F_{n-1} \\land (p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n)) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\lnot F_{n-1} & \\lnot (p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nLet's analyze the right branch, which contains the formula $\\lnot(p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n)$. This is a negated disjunction, which is an $\\alpha$-rule. Applying this rule adds two formulas, $\\lnot p_n$ and $\\lnot\\lnot p_n$, to the branch. The formula $\\lnot\\lnot p_n$ is equivalent to $p_n$. The branch now contains both $p_n$ and $\\lnot p_n$, which is a contradiction, so this branch closes. The closure of this right branch requires exactly one $\\alpha$-rule application.\n\nThe left branch contains the formula $\\lnot F_{n-1}$. To close this branch, we must construct a tableau for $\\lnot F_{n-1}$. The number of rule applications required to do this is, by definition, $A_{n-1}$.\nThe total number of rule applications, $A_n$, is the sum of the initial $\\beta$-rule application, the applications needed for the left branch ($A_{n-1}$), and the applications needed for the right branch ($1$). This gives the recurrence relation for $n \\geq 2$:\n$$\nA_n = 1 + A_{n-1} + 1 = A_{n-1} + 2\n$$\nTo find a closed-form solution, we need a base case. For $n=1$, the formula is $\\lnot F_1 = \\lnot(p_1 \\lor \\lnot p_1)$. This is a single $\\alpha$-node. Its expansion requires one $\\alpha$-rule application, which adds $\\lnot p_1$ and $\\lnot\\lnot p_1$ (i.e., $p_1$) to the tableau, causing it to close. Therefore, the base case is:\n$$\nA_1 = 1\n$$\nThe recurrence relation $A_n = A_{n-1} + 2$ with the initial condition $A_1 = 1$ describes an arithmetic progression. The closed-form expression for $A_n$ is:\n$$\nA_n = A_1 + (n-1)d = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n-1\n$$\nThe structure of the formula $\\lnot F_n$ is such that at each stage of decomposing $\\lnot F_k$, the only applicable rule is the $\\beta$-rule corresponding to the outermost negated conjunction. This means there is no alternative order of rule applications that could reduce the total count. Thus, $A_n = 2n-1$ is indeed the minimal number of rule applications.\n\nFinally, we compute the limit $L$:\n$$\nL := \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{T_n}{A_n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_n$ and $A_n$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{2^n}{2n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(2^n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}}{(2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{(2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}}\n$$\nThe limit of the numerator is trivially $2$. We need to evaluate the limit of the denominator:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nLet $y = (2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$. To evaluate this limit, we can consider the limit of its natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln(y) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln\\left((2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\right) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(2n-1)}{n}\n$$\nThis limit is of the indeterminate form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$, so we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule. We differentiate the numerator and the denominator with respect to $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dn}(\\ln(2n-1)) = \\frac{2}{2n-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dn}(n) = 1\n$$\nApplying the rule, we get:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{2}{2n-1}}{1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{2n-1} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln(y) = 0$, and the exponential function is continuous, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} y = \\exp\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ln(y)\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the limit of the denominator is $1$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $L$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n$$\nThe asymptotic base of the ratio of the two costs is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2984351"}]}
