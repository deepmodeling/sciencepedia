Let $X=\\{x,y\\}$ be a set of variables.

All definitions are standard and formally correct. The problem is well-posed; it provides all the necessary components (language, structure, term, assignment) to compute a unique result. The syntactic expression $x+x+y$ is slightly ambiguous as the function symbol $+$ is binary. However, because the interpretation of $+$ in the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ is ordinary addition on integers, which is associative, any valid parsing of the expression (e.g., $(x+x)+y$ or $x+(x+y)$) will yield the same result. Therefore, this ambiguity does not render the problem ill-posed. The problem is objective and contains no factual errors, contradictions, or missing information that would prevent a solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid.

This is denoted as $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(t(x,y))$.\n\nThe expression $x+x+y$ is an infix notation for a formal term built using the binary function symbol $+$. The formal structure of a term must be unambiguous. The standard convention for such expressions is left-associativity. Therefore, the term $t(x,y)$ represented by $x+x+y$ is formally the term $+(+(x,x),y)$.\n\nWe apply the definition of the evaluation map $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}$ recursively, following the structure of the term $+(+(x,x),y)$.\n\nAccording to the recursive definition of the evaluation map for a function symbol:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(+(x,x),y)) = \\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,x)) + \\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(y)\n$$\nHere, the $+$ on the right-hand side of the equation represents the ordinary addition operation in the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, as specified by the structure $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nTo proceed, we must evaluate the sub-terms $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,x))$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(y)$.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the term $+(x,x)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,x)) = \\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(x) + \\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(x)\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the variables using the base case of the recursion, which involves the variable assignment $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(x) = \\sigma(x) = 2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(y) = \\sigma(y) = 3\n$$\n\nSubstituting the value for $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(x)$ back into the expression for $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,x))$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,x)) = 2 + 2 = 4\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values of the evaluated sub-terms $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,x))$ and $\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(y)$ into the original equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(+(x,x),y)) = 4 + 3\n$$\nPerforming the final addition in $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n$$\n4 + 3 = 7\n$$\n\nThus, the evaluation of the term $t(x,y)=x+x+y$ under the given assignment is $7$. It is worth noting that if we had parsed the term as right-associative, i.e., $+(x,+(x,y))$, the result would be identical due to the associativity of addition in $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n$\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,+(x,y))) = \\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(x) + \\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(+(x,y)) = 2 + (\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(x)+\\mathrm{ev}_{\\mathcal{M},\\sigma}(y)) = 2 + (2+3) = 2+5 = 7$.\nThe result is independent of the parsing order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "2987475"}, {"introduction": "Quantifier elimination is one of the most powerful tools in model theory, allowing us to reduce complex quantified statements to simpler, quantifier-free conditions, thereby clarifying the definable sets of a theory.

This is a quadratic polynomial in $y$ with a positive leading coefficient ($1$), so its graph is a parabola opening upwards.

Thus, this part of the disjunction is always false.\n\nPart 3: $\\exists x \\left(-1 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\wedge \\alpha  -2 \\wedge x \\geq -\\alpha - 1\\right)$\nThis is equivalent to $\\alpha  -2 \\wedge \\exists x \\left(x \\in [-1, 1] \\wedge x \\geq -\\alpha - 1\\right)$.\nFor such an $x$ to exist, the interval $[-\\alpha - 1, 1]$ must be non-empty. This requires $-\\alpha - 1 \\leq 1$, which implies $-\\alpha \\leq 2$, or $\\alpha \\geq -2$. The condition $\\alpha  -2 \\wedge \\alpha \\geq -2$ is a contradiction. This part is also always false.\n\nCombining the results, $\\Phi(\\alpha)$ is equivalent to $(-2 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 2) \\vee \\text{false} \\vee \\text{false}$.\nTherefore, the quantifier-free formula equivalent to $\\Phi(\\alpha)$ is $-2 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 2$.

This property is a defining characteristic of the Rado graph, also known as the random graph.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the number of countable models of $T$ up to isomorphism, denoted $I(T, \\aleph_0)$. We are instructed to use Vaught's test. Vaught's test and related theorems in model theory connect the number of countable models to properties like completeness and $\\aleph_0$-categoricity. A theory is $\\aleph_0$-categorical if it has exactly one countable model up to isomorphism. Our strategy will be to prove that $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical.\n\nFirst, we establish that $T$ has no finite models. Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a finite model $M$ of $T$ with domain $V_M$. Let $N = |V_M|$ be the cardinality of the model. Let the elements of $V_M$ be $\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_N\\}$. We consider the extension axiom for $m=N$ and $n=0$. We can instantiate the universally quantified variables $x_1, \\dots, x_N$ with the elements $v_1, \\dots, v_N$. The antecedent of the axiom, which requires these elements to be distinct, is satisfied. The axiom then asserts the existence of an element $z \\in V_M$ such that $z \\neq v_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$. This is a contradiction, as $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_N\\}$ constitutes the entire domain $V_M$. Therefore, $T$ has no finite models.\n\nNext, we prove that $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical. To do this, we must show that any two countable models of $T$ are isomorphic. Let $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ be two countable models of $T$. Since the domains are countable, we can enumerate them: $V_1 = \\{a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots\\}$ and $V_2 = \\{b_0, b_1, b_2, \\dots\\}$. We construct an isomorphism $f: V_1 \\to V_2$ using a back-and-forth argument. This method builds the isomorphism step-by-step by creating a sequence of finite partial isomorphisms $f_k: A_k \\to B_k$, where $A_k \\subset V_1$ and $B_k \\subset V_2$.\n\n**Initialization:** Let $f_0: \\emptyset \\to \\emptyset$ be the empty function, which is a trivial partial isomorphism.\n\n**Inductive Step (Forth):** Assume we have a partial isomorphism $f_{2k}: A_{2k} \\to B_{2k}$ where $|A_{2k}|=|B_{2k}|=2k$. Let $a_i$ be the first element in the enumeration of $V_1$ that is not in $A_{2k}$. We must find an element $b \\in V_2 \\setminus B_{2k}$ to extend the isomorphism.\nLet $X = \\{x \\in A_{2k} \\mid (a_i, x) \\in E_1\\}$ and $Y = A_{2k} \\setminus X$. Let $X' = f_{2k}(X)$ and $Y' = f_{2k}(Y)$. To preserve the graph structure, we need to find $b \\in V_2$ such that for all $x' \\in X'$, $(b, x') \\in E_2$, and for all $y' \\in Y'$, $(b, y') \\notin E_2$. Also, we require $b \\notin B_{2k} = X' \\cup Y'$.\nLet $|X'| = m$ and $|Y'|=n$. Since $G_2$ is a model of $T$, the extension axiom for this pair $(m,n)$ guarantees the existence of such a vertex $b \\in V_2$ that is adjacent to all vertices in $X'$, not adjacent to any in $Y'$, and is distinct from all vertices in $B_{2k}$. We pick one such $b$ and define $f_{2k+1} = f_{2k} \\cup \\{(a_i, b)\\}$, with domain $A_{2k+1} = A_{2k} \\cup \\{a_i\\}$ and range $B_{2k+1} = B_{2k} \\cup \\{b\\}$.\n\n**Inductive Step (Back):** Now consider the partial isomorphism $f_{2k+1}: A_{2k+1} \\to B_{2k+1}$. Let $b_j$ be the first element in the enumeration of $V_2$ not in $B_{2k+1}$. Using a symmetric argument, we use the extension axioms in the model $G_1$ to find an element $a \\in V_1 \\setminus A_{2k+1}$ that has the correct adjacency relations with respect to the preimages of neighbors and non-neighbors of $b_j$ in $B_{2k+1}$. We then extend the map to $f_{2k+2}$ by setting $f_{2k+2}(a) = b_j$.\n\n**Conclusion of Construction:** By alternating between the \"forth\" and \"back\" steps, we ensure that every element of $V_1$ eventually is added to the domain and every element of $V_2$ to the range. The resulting function $f = \\bigcup_{k=0}^{\\infty} f_k$ is a total isomorphism between $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n\nSince any two countable models of $T$ are isomorphic, the theory $T$ is, by definition, $\\aleph_0$-categorical.\nA theory is $\\aleph_0$-categorical if and only if it has exactly one countable model up to isomorphism. Therefore, the number of countable models of $T$ is $1$.\n\nThis result fits within the framework of Vaught's test. A key theorem in model theory (the Ryll-Nardzewski theorem) states that a complete theory in a countable language with no finite models is $\\aleph_0$-categorical. Our finding that $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical implies its completeness. Vaught's test states that such a complete theory must have either $1$ or at least $\\aleph_0$ countable models. Having established $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical, we conclude the number of such models is exactly $1$. The fact that $T$ has quantifier elimination, as stated in the problem, is a key property that enables the back-and-forth argument, as it ensures that the \"type\" of an element over a finite set is determined by its quantifier-free formula relationships, i.e., its edge connections.\nThe number of countable models of $T$ up to isomorphism is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2987471"}]}
