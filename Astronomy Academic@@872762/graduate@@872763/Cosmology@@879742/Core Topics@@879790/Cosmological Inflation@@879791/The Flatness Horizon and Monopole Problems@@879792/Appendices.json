This phantom energy is characterized by a constant equation of state parameter $w  -1$. This phase lasts until a later time $t_f$.\n\nLet the scale factor of the universe be $a(t)$. The expansion rate is described by the Hubble parameter $H(t) = \\dot{a}/a$. In a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, the dynamics are governed by the first Friedmann equation:\n$$ H^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho - \\frac{k}{a^2} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the total energy density of the universe and $k$ is the curvature constant.\n\nThe curvature density parameter is defined as $\\Omega_k = -k / (a^2 H^2)$.
