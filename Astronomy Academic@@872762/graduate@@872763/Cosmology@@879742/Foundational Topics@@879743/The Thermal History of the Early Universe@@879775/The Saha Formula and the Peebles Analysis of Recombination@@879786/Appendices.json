The dynamics of this process are governed by the competition between atomic transition rates and the expansion of the universe. A detailed analysis, pioneered by Peebles, involves tracking the populations of hydrogen's excited states. While the $n=2$ state plays a crucial role as a bottleneck, understanding the higher levels is also important for a complete picture.\n\nThis problem focuses on the fate of a hydrogen atom in the $n=3$ excited state. Such an atom can either be photoionized by a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon or radiatively decay to a lower level. The direct decay to the ground state ($n=1$) is strongly suppressed because the emitted Lyman-$\\beta$ photon is almost certain to be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in the ground state. Therefore, the effective route for an electron in the $n=3$ state to reach the ground state is by cascading through the $n=2$ level.\n\nYour task is to calculate the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = \\Gamma_{3c} / \\Lambda_{3\\to2}$ at a CMB temperature $T$. Here, $\\Gamma_{3c}$ is the photoionization rate from the $n=3$ level, and $\\Lambda_{3\\to2}$ is the net radiative decay rate from the $n=3$ to the $n=2$ level. Derive a closed-form symbolic expression for $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nYou are provided with the following information and physical relations:\n\n1.  The photoionization cross-section for a hydrogen atom in the state with principal quantum number $n$, for a photon of energy $E > I_n$, is given by the Kramer's formula:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_n(E) = \\frac{64\\pi \\alpha a_0^2}{3\\sqrt{3} n^5} \\left(\\frac{I_1}{E}\\right)^3\n    $$\n    where $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $a_0$ is the Bohr radius, and $I_n = I_1/n^2$ is the ionization energy of the $n$-th level, with $I_1$ being the ground state ionization energy.\n\n2.  The CMB is a thermal photon bath at temperature $T$. For calculating the photoionization rate, you may use the Wien approximation for the number density of photons per unit energy, which is valid for $E \\gg k_B T$:\n    $$\n    n_\\gamma(E) dE = \\frac{8\\pi}{(hc)^3} E^2 e^{-E/k_B T} dE\n    $$\n    where $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. You should also use the fact that $I_3 \\gg k_B T$ to approximate any resulting integrals.\n\n3.

The line profile is a Voigt profile, resulting from the convolution of a Gaussian core due to thermal Doppler broadening and Lorentzian wings.
