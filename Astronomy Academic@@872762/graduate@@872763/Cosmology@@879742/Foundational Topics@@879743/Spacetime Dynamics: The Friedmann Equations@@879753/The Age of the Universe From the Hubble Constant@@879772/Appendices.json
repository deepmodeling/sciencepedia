In this simplified model, the age of the universe, often called the Hubble time, is the reciprocal of the Hubble constant, $H_0$.

The units of $H_0$ are distance/time per distance, which simplifies to an inverse time. To find the age, we must perform unit conversions to arrive at the desired unit of billions of years.\n\nFirst, let's substitute the value of $H_0$ into the equation. The units can be expressed more clearly by rearranging the fraction:\n$$t_{\\text{age}} = \\frac{1}{71.0 \\frac{\\text{km}}{\\text{s} \\cdot \\text{Mpc}}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ s} \\cdot \\text{Mpc}}{71.0 \\text{ km}}$$\nTo obtain the age in seconds, we must convert the distance unit of megaparsecs (Mpc) to kilometers (km) so that the distance units cancel. The problem provides the conversion factor: $1 \\text{ Mpc} = 3.086 \\times 10^{19} \\text{ km}$.
