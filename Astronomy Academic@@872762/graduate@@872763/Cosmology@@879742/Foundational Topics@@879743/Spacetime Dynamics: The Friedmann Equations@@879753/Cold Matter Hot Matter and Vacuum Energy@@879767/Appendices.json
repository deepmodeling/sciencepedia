The total energy density $\\rho$ is composed of several components, primarily non-relativistic matter (cold matter), radiation (hot matter), and vacuum energy (a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$).\n\nThe energy density of each component scales with the scale factor $a(t)$ as follows:\n-   Radiation (relativistic particles): $\\rho_r(a) = \\rho_{r,0} a^{-4}$\n-   Matter (non-relativistic particles): $\\rho_m(a) = \\rho_{m,0} a^{-3}$\n-   Vacuum energy (cosmological constant): $\\rho_\\Lambda(a) = \\rho_{\\Lambda,0}$\n\nHere, the subscript '0' denotes the value of a quantity at the present cosmological time, where the scale factor is normalized to $a_0 = 1$.
