By combining the definitions of trigonometric parallax, $p$, proper motion, $\\mu$, and angular size, you will derive a timescale of celestial motion. This practice is valuable because it forces you to translate between physical units (like radius $R$) and angular units on the sky, a crucial skill in observational astronomy [@problem_id:894694].", "problem": "A distant star is observed from the solar system. Its position and properties are characterized by several astrometric parameters.\n\nThe trigonometric parallax, $p$, is half the maximum apparent angular shift of a star due to the Earth's orbital motion. For small angles, the distance $d$ to the star is related to its parallax by $d = A/p$, where $A$ is one astronomical unit (the radius of Earth's orbit). By convention, if $p$ is measured in arcseconds, the distance $d$ in units of parsecs (pc) is given by $d = 1/p$. One parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond.\n\nThe star has a physical radius $R$. As seen from Earth, this physical dimension corresponds to an angular radius, $\\alpha$. For a star at distance $d$, the small-angle approximation gives $\\alpha \\approx R/d$. The angular diameter is thus $\\Theta_D = 2\\alpha$.\n\nThe star also exhibits proper motion, which is its angular velocity across the celestial sphere as seen from the solar system's barycenter. The proper motion is described by two components: $\\mu_\\alpha$ in the direction of increasing right ascension ($\\alpha$) and $\\mu_\\delta$ in the direction of increasing declination ($\\delta$). On the spherical celestial grid, a change in right ascension $\\Delta\\alpha$ corresponds to an angular arc length of $(\\Delta\\alpha)\\cos\\delta$. Consequently, the total proper motion $\\mu$ is the magnitude of the vector sum of two orthogonal velocity components: one along the parallel of declination and one along the meridian.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nA star is located at a declination $\\delta$. It has a trigonometric parallax $p$, a proper motion in right ascension $\\mu_\\alpha$, and a proper motion in declination $\\mu_\\delta$. The ratio of the star's physical radius $R$ to the astronomical unit $A$ is given by the dimensionless quantity $\\rho = R/A$.\n\nAssuming all relevant angles are small, determine the time, $\\Delta t$, it would take for the star to move across the celestial sphere by an angular distance equal to its own apparent angular diameter. The parallax $p$ and proper motion components $\\mu_\\alpha$ and $\\mu_\\delta$ are given in units of arcseconds and arcseconds per unit time, respectively. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $p, \\rho, \\mu_\\alpha, \\mu_\\delta,$ and $\\delta$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the time $\\Delta t$ required for a star to travel an angular distance equal to its own angular diameter, $\\Theta_D$. This time can be found by dividing the angular distance by the total angular speed, which is the magnitude of the proper motion, $\\mu$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Theta_D}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nWe need to derive expressions for the angular diameter $\\Theta_D$ and the total proper motion $\\mu$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the angular diameter $\\Theta_D$**\n\nThe angular radius $\\alpha$ of the star is given by the small-angle approximation $\\alpha \\approx R/d$, where $R$ is the star's physical radius and $d$ is its distance from Earth. The angular diameter is twice the angular radius, so $\\Theta_D = 2\\alpha \\approx 2R/d$.\n\nThe problem provides the ratio $\\rho = R/A$, where $A$ is the astronomical unit. So, we can write $R = \\rho A$.\n\nThe distance $d$ is related to the parallax $p$. By definition, a star at a distance of 1 parsec (pc) has a parallax of 1 arcsecond (''). Thus, for a parallax $p$ in arcseconds, the distance $d$ in parsecs is $d~[\\text{pc}] = 1/p~['']$.\n\nTo maintain consistent units for $R$ and $d$, we must express $d$ in terms of the astronomical unit $A$. The definition of the parsec is the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond. Using the small angle approximation, $1~\\text{pc} \\approx (1~A) / (1''~\\text{in radians})$. This means that distance in AU is related to distance in parsecs by $d~[A] = d~[\\text{pc}] \\times (\\text{number of AU in one pc})$. The number of AU in one pc is equal to the number of arcseconds in one radian.\nThe distance can be related to the parallax $p$ in arcseconds by $d = (1/p) \\times A / (1''~\\text{in radians})$.\n\nNow we can compute the angular diameter $\\Theta_D$. It is simpler to work with ratios.\n$$ \\Theta_D = \\frac{2R}{d} = \\frac{2 \\rho A}{d} $$\nBy definition of parallax $p$, $p = A/d$. Therefore, $d = A/p$.\n$$ \\Theta_D = \\frac{2 \\rho A}{A/p} = 2 \\rho p $$\nThis gives the angular diameter in radians if $p$ is in radians. If $p$ is in arcseconds, $\\Theta_D$ is also in arcseconds. So, the angular diameter of the star in arcseconds is $2\\rho p$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total proper motion $\\mu$**\n\nThe proper motion is given by two components: $\\mu_\\alpha = d\\alpha/dt$ and $\\mu_\\delta = d\\delta/dt$.\nThe component $\\mu_\\delta$ represents an angular velocity along a meridian of the celestial sphere.\nThe component $\\mu_\\alpha$ is a rate of change in the right ascension coordinate. At a declination $\\delta$, a differential change in right ascension $d\\alpha$ corresponds to a differential arc length on the celestial sphere of $ds_\\alpha = d\\alpha \\cos\\delta$. The angular velocity component along the parallel of declination is therefore $v_\\alpha = (d\\alpha/dt)\\cos\\delta = \\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta$.\n\nThe two components of motion, along the meridian and along the parallel of declination, are orthogonal. The magnitude of the total proper motion vector, $\\mu$, is found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\n\\mu = \\sqrt{v_\\alpha^2 + v_\\delta^2} = \\sqrt{(\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta)^2 + \\mu_\\delta^2}\n$$\nIf $\\mu_\\alpha$ and $\\mu_\\delta$ are given in arcseconds per unit time, then $\\mu$ is also in arcseconds per unit time.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the timescale $\\Delta t$**\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps. The time required for the star to travel its angular diameter is:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Theta_D~['']}{\\mu~[''/\\text{time unit}]}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\Theta_D$ and $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{2\\rho p}{\\sqrt{(\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta)^2 + \\mu_\\delta^2}}\n$$\nIf the proper motion components are given in arcseconds/year, the resulting timescale $\\Delta t$ will be in years.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2 \\rho p}{\\sqrt{(\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta)^2 + \\mu_\\delta^2}}} $$", "id": "894694"}, {"introduction": "Having established the fundamental relationships, we now turn to the practical realities of measurement.

The tangential velocity of a star, $v_t$, is determined from its trigonometric parallax, $p$, and the magnitude of its proper motion, $\\mu$. The relation can be written as $v_t = K (\\mu/p)$, where $K$ is a constant whose value depends on the system of units. The parallax $p$ (in arcseconds) is related to the distance $d$ (in parsecs) by the conventional formula $d = 1/p$.\n\nFor a particular star, the survey provides a measurement of its parallax with an uncertainty of $\\sigma_p$. The star's proper motion, $\\mu$, is determined by comparing two angular position measurements taken at the beginning and the end of a time interval of duration $T$. The uncertainty of a single position measurement in one angular direction (e.g., right ascension or declination) is $\\sigma_{pos}$.\n\nAssuming that the measurement errors for the parallax and the two positions are all statistically independent, determine the critical distance $d_c$. This is the distance at which the uncertainty in the tangential velocity, $\\sigma_{v_t}$, receives equal contributions from the uncertainty in the parallax measurement and the uncertainty in the proper motion measurement.\n\nExpress your answer for $d_c$ in parsecs, in terms of $\\mu$, $\\sigma_p$, $\\sigma_{pos}$, and $T$.

The contribution from proper motion is $\\sigma_{v_t,\\mu} = | \\partial v_t / \\partial \\mu | \\sigma_\\mu = (K/p)\\sigma_\\mu$.\n\nThe critical distance $d_c$ is where these contributions are equal: $(K\\mu/p^2)\\sigma_p = (K/p)\\sigma_\\mu$.
