The characteristic comoving scale of this ruler, set by the sound horizon at the drag epoch, is denoted by $r_s$.

This problem shifts the focus from calculation to the principles of data analysis, challenging you to distinguish between systematic and random errors in the context of a BAO measurement [@problem_id:1936579]. Properly identifying error sources, such as bias from an incorrect fiducial model versus statistical fluctuations from cosmic variance, is fundamental to correctly interpreting cosmological results.", "problem": "A cosmologist is working to constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, which characterizes the pressure-to-density ratio of dark energy and is assumed to be constant. The primary method employed is the use of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) as a \"standard ruler\". In the early universe, sound waves propagating through the primordial plasma imprinted a characteristic physical scale, the sound horizon $r_s$, onto the matter distribution. In the late-time universe, this manifests as a slight excess in the probability of finding pairs of galaxies separated by this comoving distance $r_s$.\n\nTo measure this scale from a galaxy redshift survey, an analyst must convert the observed galaxy redshift separations ($\\Delta z$) and angular separations ($\\Delta \\theta$) into comoving distances. This conversion is model-dependent, relying on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$, which are functions of the underlying cosmological parameters, including $w$. The standard analysis procedure involves assuming a \"fiducial\" cosmology to perform this conversion and then comparing the measured BAO scale to the theoretical prediction for $r_s$ to constrain the true cosmological parameters.\n\nThe cosmologist identifies two distinct sources of uncertainty that will affect the final measured value of $w$.\n\n**Source A:** The fiducial cosmological model used in the data analysis pipeline to convert redshifts and angles to comoving distances is chosen for convenience (e.g., a flat universe with $w_{\\text{fid}} = -1$, corresponding to a cosmological constant), but it may differ from the true cosmology of our universe (e.g., the true value might be $w_{\\text{true}} = -0.9$).\n\n**Source B:** The galaxy distribution observed within the finite volume of the survey is just one statistical realization of the underlying cosmic density field. This leads to an intrinsic statistical uncertainty in any measured clustering statistic, such as the galaxy power spectrum from which the BAO scale is extracted. This effect is known as \"cosmic variance\".\n\nBased on the principles of experimental physics and data analysis, which of the following statements correctly classifies and characterizes these two sources of error in the determination of $w$?\n\nA. Source A represents a random error because the true value of $w$ is unknown. Source B represents a systematic error because cosmic variance is an inherent, non-instrumental feature of the universe.\nB. Both Source A and Source B are systematic errors, as their origins are in theoretical modeling and cosmic properties, not in imperfections of the measurement apparatus.\nC. Source A is a systematic error, but its impact on the final measurement of $w$ can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the survey volume. Source B is a random error whose impact is independent of the survey volume.\nD. Source A is a systematic error that introduces a bias in the estimate of $w$ which is not guaranteed to decrease with a larger survey volume. Source B is a random error whose contribution to the uncertainty in $w$ decreases as the survey volume increases.\nE. Both Source A and Source B are random errors. The effect of Source A can be mitigated by later re-analyzing the data with different fiducial models, and the effect of Source B can be reduced by averaging data from larger or more numerous surveys.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the definitions of systematic and random errors in experimental inference. A systematic error is a bias that shifts an estimator’s expectation away from the true value and does not in general decrease with increased sample size or survey volume unless the underlying cause is modeled and corrected. A random error is a fluctuation due to finite sampling that averages down as the number of independent measurements increases, typically scaling with the inverse square root of the sample size.\n\nFor BAO measurements, observed angular and redshift separations are mapped into comoving distances using a fiducial cosmology. If the fiducial model differs from the true cosmology, this induces anisotropic dilations between the true and fiducial distance scales. These are conventionally parameterized by\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\perp}(z)=\\frac{D_{A}(z)\\,r_{s,\\text{fid}}}{D_{A,\\text{fid}}(z)\\,r_{s}}, \n\\qquad\n\\alpha_{\\parallel}(z)=\\frac{H_{\\text{fid}}(z)\\,r_{s,\\text{fid}}}{H(z)\\,r_{s}},\n$$\nwhere $D_{A}(z)$ and $H(z)$ are the true angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter, $r_{s}$ is the true sound horizon, and the subscript “fid” denotes the quantities in the fiducial cosmological model. If one fixes the fiducial mapping and does not fit for these dilation parameters (or equivalently does not propagate the model dependence of $D_{A}(z)$ and $H(z)$), the inferred BAO scale is biased relative to the true one. This bias propagates into a biased estimate of $w$, and its magnitude is not guaranteed to decrease as the survey volume increases; the mapping error is a model-assumption effect, not a finite-sample fluctuation. Therefore, Source A is a systematic error.\n\nNext, consider cosmic variance. The galaxy power spectrum estimator $\\hat{P}(k)$ has variance\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left[\\hat{P}(k)\\right]\\simeq \\frac{2}{N_{k}}\\left(P(k)+\\frac{1}{\\bar{n}}\\right)^{2},\n$$\nwhere $N_{k}$ is the number of independent Fourier modes in the bin near wavenumber $k$, $P(k)$ is the true power spectrum, and $\\bar{n}$ is the number density of tracers. In the cosmic-variance limit with negligible shot noise, this reduces to $\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{P}(k)]\\propto \\frac{P(k)^{2}}{N_{k}}$. Since $N_{k}\\propto V$ (more precisely $N_{k}\\propto V\\,k^{2}\\Delta k/(2\\pi^{2})$), the standard deviation scales as $V^{-1/2}$. Thus, the uncertainty in $w$ sourced by cosmic variance is a random error that decreases as the survey volume increases. Therefore, Source B is a random error.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because Source A is not random; it is a model-induced bias, i.e., systematic. Source B is not systematic; it is stochastic and averages down with volume.\n- B is incorrect because Source B is not a systematic bias; it is a random sampling fluctuation.\n- C is incorrect because the impact of Source A is not guaranteed to vanish with larger volume; bias persists unless the modeling is corrected. It also incorrectly states that the impact of Source B is independent of survey volume; in fact it decreases with volume.\n- D is correct: Source A is a systematic bias not guaranteed to decrease with volume, and Source B is a random error whose contribution decreases as the survey volume increases.\n- E is incorrect because Source A is not a random error; re-analysis can mitigate bias, but the classification remains systematic.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification and characterization are given by option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1936579"}]}
