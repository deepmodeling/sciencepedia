## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical underpinnings of [cosmic structure formation](@entry_id:137761) through the idealized models of spherically symmetric "top-hat" collapse and the Press-Schechter formalism. While these models are predicated on simplifying assumptions, their true power lies not in their literal depiction of reality but in their utility as a versatile and surprisingly robust framework. They serve as a foundational analytical tool that connects the primordial universe to the observed [cosmic web](@entry_id:162042), and their adaptability allows for the exploration of a vast range of physical phenomena.

This chapter will demonstrate the remarkable breadth of application of these core principles. We will move beyond the basic theory to explore how it is extended to build more realistic models of halo structure, how it is employed as a powerful probe of fundamental physics beyond the [standard cosmological model](@entry_id:159833), and how it incorporates the complex interplay of baryonic physics and gravitational dynamics. Through these examples, the [spherical collapse model](@entry_id:159843) and the Press-Schechter formalism will be revealed not as historical artifacts, but as a living theoretical laboratory for [modern cosmology](@entry_id:752086).

### Refining the Model: From Idealized Spheres to Realistic Halos

The foundational models provide a statistical description of the number of collapsed objects of a given mass. However, the [excursion set formalism](@entry_id:161517), which underpins the Press-Schechter model, contains the seeds of a much richer description of halo properties and their relationship to the cosmic environment.

#### Ellipsoidal Collapse and Environmental Effects

A primary idealization of the top-hat model is its assumption of spherical symmetry. Real cosmic overdensities are asymmetric and reside within a complex tidal field generated by the surrounding [large-scale structure](@entry_id:158990). An important extension, known as the [ellipsoidal collapse](@entry_id:159908) model, accounts for this by considering the evolution of an initially ellipsoidal perturbation. In this more realistic picture, the condition for collapse is no longer a simple density threshold. Instead, it depends on the full deformation tensor, which includes the local tidal shear.

Within the excursion set framework, this can be modeled by tracking not only the random walk of the [density contrast](@entry_id:157948) $\delta(S)$ but also that of the tidal shear, $q(S)$, as a function of the variance $S = \sigma^2(M)$. The presence of external shear generically raises the density required for collapse. This leads to a modified, shear-dependent collapse barrier of the form $\delta_c + \alpha q(S)$, where $\alpha$ is a coupling constant. The correlation between the random walks of density and shear introduces a correction to the standard [halo mass function](@entry_id:158011). For massive halos, this correction is a function of the peak height $\nu_c = \delta_c/\sigma(M)$, reflecting how the local environment systematically alters the abundance of collapsed objects [@problem_id:849774]. This formalism can be extended to derive a full bivariate [mass function](@entry_id:158970), $n(M, q)$, which provides the [number density](@entry_id:268986) of halos as a function of both their mass and their tidal shear environment, offering a far more detailed statistical description of the halo population than the simple univariate [mass function](@entry_id:158970) [@problem_id:849844].

#### Mass Accretion History and Halo Structure

The excursion set random walk provides more than just the probability of first crossing a barrier. The trajectory of the walk itself can be mapped to the [mass accretion](@entry_id:163137) history of a dark matter halo. A halo of mass $M$ at [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z$ is the endpoint of a specific path in the $(\delta, S)$ plane. The points along this path correspond to the properties of its progenitor halos at earlier times.

This connection allows us to link the internal structural properties of halos to their formation history. For instance, the concentration of a halo—a measure of its central density—is observed to be correlated with its mass and redshift. This can be understood within the [excursion set formalism](@entry_id:161517) by defining a "formation redshift," $z_f$, for a halo. A common definition is the [redshift](@entry_id:159945) at which the main progenitor first accreted a significant fraction of its final mass. This formation event corresponds to a specific [first-passage time](@entry_id:268196) problem for the progenitor's random walk. By relating the halo concentration at [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z$ to its formation [redshift](@entry_id:159945), e.g., via a simple model like $c \propto (1+z_f)/(1+z)$, one can derive the median concentration-mass relation, $c(M, z)$, directly from the statistics of the [linear density](@entry_id:158735) field. This procedure correctly predicts that less massive halos, which typically form earlier (higher $z_f$), are more concentrated than more massive halos at a given observation [redshift](@entry_id:159945) [@problem_id:849777].

#### Assembly Bias

The link between formation history and halo properties extends beyond internal structure to affect how halos are distributed in space. The standard prediction for [halo bias](@entry_id:161548)—the measure of how strongly halos cluster compared to the underlying matter distribution—depends only on halo mass. However, the excursion set framework predicts a subtler effect known as "[assembly bias](@entry_id:158211)": at a fixed mass, the clustering of halos also depends on their formation time and other assembly-history properties.

This can be explored using a two-barrier excursion set model. Consider a population of halos of mass $M$ at [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z_0$. Their formation redshift, defined as the time when their main progenitor reached mass $M/2$, corresponds to a second, higher-variance [barrier crossing](@entry_id:198645). The distribution of formation times within this halo population can be calculated, allowing one to isolate, for example, the earliest-forming and latest-forming [quartiles](@entry_id:167370). The linear bias of these subpopulations can then be computed, revealing that halos with different assembly histories cluster differently, even though they have the same final mass. Typically, for low-mass halos, earlier-forming halos are more strongly clustered (more biased) than later-forming ones. This demonstrates that halo mass is not the sole determinant of halo properties, and that a halo's large-scale environment is intertwined with its growth history [@problem_id:849838].

#### The Dynamics of Accretion

The [spherical collapse model](@entry_id:159843) also provides insights into the dynamics of matter falling onto a collapsed object. At late times, after a central object has formed, the continuing infall of surrounding matter can often be described by a [self-similar solution](@entry_id:173717). In these solutions, the spatial profile of physical quantities like density and velocity retains its shape over time, while the [characteristic scales](@entry_id:144643) of the system evolve as a power law in time. For a pressure-free, spherically symmetric infall in an Einstein-de Sitter universe, the system evolves towards an attractor solution. In the region well inside the turnaround radius but outside the very central object, the dynamics are dominated by the gravity of the central mass. This leads to a characteristic power-law profile for the infall velocity, with the velocity magnitude scaling with physical radius $R$ as $|v| \propto R^{-1/2}$. This profile represents a state of quasi-steady free-fall onto the central mass and is a fundamental feature of spherical gravitational accretion, providing a bridge between the idealized collapse model and the [hydrodynamics](@entry_id:158871) of galaxy formation [@problem_id:849840].

### Probing Fundamental Physics

The Press-Schechter framework's reliance on a few key ingredients—the statistics of the initial density field, the [linear growth](@entry_id:157553) of perturbations, and the critical collapse threshold—makes it an exceptionally sensitive tool for testing fundamental physics. Any deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the early universe or in the laws of gravity will leave its imprint on these ingredients, leading to potentially observable consequences in the abundance and properties of [dark matter halos](@entry_id:147523).

#### Primordial Non-Gaussianity

The standard model of inflation predicts that the primordial [density perturbations](@entry_id:159546) are very nearly Gaussian. However, a wide range of alternative [inflationary models](@entry_id:161366) predict small but detectable levels of non-Gaussianity, which would skew the probability distribution of the initial density field. The [halo mass function](@entry_id:158011), particularly at the high-mass end, is exponentially sensitive to the tail of this distribution and is therefore one of the most powerful probes of primordial non-Gaussianity.

This effect can be quantified by modeling the non-Gaussian probability density function (PDF) using an Edgeworth expansion, which introduces corrections to the Gaussian PDF based on its [higher-order moments](@entry_id:266936), such as the [skewness](@entry_id:178163) $S_3$. A non-zero [skewness](@entry_id:178163), parameterized by the nonlinearity parameter $f_{NL}$, alters the probability of finding the high-density peaks required to form massive halos. This results in a scale-dependent correction to the [halo mass function](@entry_id:158011) relative to the Gaussian prediction. For specific shapes of non-Gaussianity, such as the "equilateral" type, this leads to a characteristic power-law enhancement or suppression of the abundance of massive halos that scales with the peak height as $\nu_c^3$, offering a clear observational signature to constrain the physics of inflation [@problem_id:849830] [@problem_id:849816].

#### The Nature of Dark Matter and Dark Sectors

While the [standard model](@entry_id:137424) assumes dark matter to be a simple, collisionless cold fluid, its true nature remains one of the greatest mysteries in physics. The [spherical collapse](@entry_id:161208) framework can be readily adapted to explore how alternative dark matter properties would affect structure formation.

For example, in Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) models, dark matter particles have a non-negligible cross-section for scattering with each other. While these interactions have a negligible effect during the early [linear phase](@entry_id:274637) of collapse, they become important after the halo turns around and virializes. The energy dissipation and redistribution caused by self-interactions lead to a different final equilibrium state compared to the collisionless case. By applying the virial theorem to a halo profile expected from SIDM relaxation (such as an [isothermal sphere](@entry_id:159991)), one can calculate a modified virial radius and a significantly different [virial overdensity](@entry_id:756504), $\Delta_v$. This changes the predicted final state of collapsed halos, offering a way to distinguish SIDM from standard CDM [@problem_id:849791].

Similarly, one can explore new interactions within a hypothetical "dark sector." If dark matter interacts with a relativistic species like [dark radiation](@entry_id:157481), this could create a drag force on collapsing overdensities. Such a force would impede the growth of perturbations, altering the evolution of the linear [density contrast](@entry_id:157948). By solving the modified perturbation equations, one can determine the new growing mode exponent. This, in turn, changes the mapping from the initial density to the final collapse time, effectively modifying the critical density threshold $\delta_c$ and altering the predicted halo abundance [@problem_id:849827].

#### Modified Gravity

The [spherical collapse model](@entry_id:159843) is a crucial tool for testing General Relativity (GR) on cosmological scales. Many theories of [modified gravity](@entry_id:158859) (MG) postulate changes to the laws of gravity that become apparent on large scales or in low-density environments. These modifications typically alter the [growth of cosmic structure](@entry_id:750080) in two main ways: by changing the relationship between density and the [gravitational potential](@entry_id:160378) (via a modified Poisson equation), and by introducing a "[fifth force](@entry_id:157526)."

These effects are incorporated into the Press-Schechter framework by modifying the linear growth factor $D(z)$ and the critical collapse threshold $\delta_c$. For instance, in $f(R)$ gravity, the [fifth force](@entry_id:157526) enhances gravity, which both speeds up the linear growth of perturbations and lowers the density threshold required for a region to collapse. Both effects tend to increase the number of massive halos compared to GR. These modifications can be propagated through the entire [excursion set formalism](@entry_id:161517) to predict changes in derived quantities like halo merger rates, providing distinct, redshift-dependent observational tests of GR [@problem_id:849834]. Different theories predict different modifications; for example, models inspired by the [decoupling](@entry_id:160890) limit of dRGT [massive gravity](@entry_id:200045) can be modeled with an enhanced effective [gravitational constant](@entry_id:262704) during non-linear collapse, leading to a modified turnaround overdensity [@problem_id:849802]. Some theories also feature "screening mechanisms" that restore GR in high-density regions. These can be modeled as a scale-dependent modification to gravity, which imprints a unique signature on the shape of the high-mass tail of the [halo mass function](@entry_id:158011) [@problem_id:849829].

#### Primordial Isocurvature Perturbations

Finally, the collapse framework can test assumptions about the [initial conditions](@entry_id:152863) of the universe. The [standard cosmological model](@entry_id:159833) is built upon adiabatic [primordial perturbations](@entry_id:160053), where all species have the same fractional [number density](@entry_id:268986) perturbation. An alternative is an [isocurvature perturbation](@entry_id:158833), where the total energy density is initially uniform, but the relative abundances of different components (e.g., baryons and CDM) vary. Such [initial conditions](@entry_id:152863), though subdominant, are predicted by some [inflationary models](@entry_id:161366). While there is no initial total matter overdensity, gravitational evolution after [matter-radiation equality](@entry_id:161150) naturally sources a growing-mode adiabatic perturbation. By calculating the amplitude of the matter perturbation generated from an initial isocurvature mode and tracing its [linear growth](@entry_id:157553) until it reaches $\delta_c$, one can determine the initial isocurvature amplitude required for a region to collapse by a certain [redshift](@entry_id:159945). This allows observational limits on the abundance of halos to be translated into powerful constraints on non-standard physics in the early universe [@problem_id:849851].

### Integrating Complex Physics

The simplest form of the [spherical collapse model](@entry_id:159843) operates in a universe containing only dark matter. To connect its predictions to the observable universe of galaxies, it is essential to incorporate the effects of [baryons](@entry_id:193732) and to consider the interplay between [structure formation](@entry_id:158241) and the global [cosmic expansion](@entry_id:161002).

#### Baryonic Feedback

While dark matter dominates the [gravitational potential](@entry_id:160378) of halos, the [baryons](@entry_id:193732) within them form stars, [supernovae](@entry_id:161773), and [supermassive black holes](@entry_id:157796). The energy and momentum injected by these processes—collectively known as baryonic feedback—can oppose [gravitational collapse](@entry_id:161275). This feedback is particularly effective in low-mass halos, where the potential wells are shallower. It can heat and expel gas, quenching [star formation](@entry_id:160356) and suppressing the growth of the halo.

This complex physical process can be incorporated into the [spherical collapse model](@entry_id:159843) in a phenomenological way. One can model the net effect of this feedback pressure as a repulsive force that effectively weakens gravity. This can be parameterized by a mass-dependent effective gravitational constant, $G_{eff}(M)$, which approaches the standard Newtonian constant $G$ for very massive halos (where feedback is less effective) and is reduced for low-mass halos. Since the critical collapse density $\delta_c$ is tied to the collapse timescale, which depends on the strength of gravity, this modification results in a mass-dependent critical density, $\delta_c(M)$. This function increases sharply for masses below a characteristic scale, signifying that low-mass halos require a much larger initial perturbation to overcome baryonic feedback and collapse. This modification is crucial for reconciling the predicted [halo mass function](@entry_id:158011) with observed galaxy [number counts](@entry_id:160205) [@problem_id:849843].

#### Cosmological Backreaction

In a final, profound application, we can close the loop between [structure formation](@entry_id:158241) and background cosmology. The standard Friedmann equations describe a perfectly homogeneous universe. However, as structures form, the universe becomes inhomogeneous. The process of [gravitational collapse](@entry_id:161275) converts potential energy into kinetic energy, which is then dissipated as the halo virializes. The total energy of a bound halo is negative relative to the background.

This net binding energy of the entire population of cosmic structures represents a component of the universe's total [energy budget](@entry_id:201027) that is not accounted for in the homogeneous background model. This "gravitational [backreaction](@entry_id:203910)" can be modeled as an effective fluid with its own energy density, $\rho_B$, and pressure, $p_B$. The energy density is simply the integrated binding energy of all halos per unit volume. By calculating how this integrated energy density evolves with the scale factor—a calculation that involves integrating the halo binding energy over the Press-Schechter [mass function](@entry_id:158970)—and applying the fluid conservation equation, one can derive the effective [equation of state parameter](@entry_id:159133), $w_B = p_B/\rho_B$, for this [backreaction](@entry_id:203910) fluid. The result is typically a negative [equation of state](@entry_id:141675), indicating that the process of [structure formation](@entry_id:158241) itself acts as a mild dark-energy-like component, albeit one that is far too small to explain the observed cosmic acceleration. This application elegantly demonstrates the deep theoretical consistency of the cosmological model, linking the statistical mechanics of halo formation back to the dynamics of the universe as a whole [@problem_id:849828].

### Conclusion

The journey through these applications reveals the [spherical collapse](@entry_id:161208) and Press-Schechter models as far more than a simple, heuristic picture. They constitute a powerful and adaptable theoretical framework that forms a cornerstone of [modern cosmology](@entry_id:752086). By extending the model to incorporate more realistic dynamics, it provides crucial insights into the formation history and observable properties of [dark matter halos](@entry_id:147523). By modifying its core components, it transforms into a precise laboratory for testing fundamental physics, from the nature of inflation and dark matter to the validity of General Relativity itself. Finally, by integrating the complexities of baryonic feedback and [cosmological backreaction](@entry_id:157736), it serves as an indispensable bridge connecting the elegant abstractions of theory to the rich and complex tapestry of the observed universe.
