## Introduction
One of the most fundamental puzzles in cosmology is the observed dominance of matter over [antimatter](@entry_id:153431) in the universe. Standard [big bang theory](@entry_id:161690) predicts they should have been created in equal amounts, leading to mutual [annihilation](@entry_id:159364) and a cosmos filled only with radiation. The fact that we exist implies that a mechanism must have dynamically generated a slight excess of matter, a process known as [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277). This article addresses the knowledge gap left by the Standard Model of particle physics, which, while containing hints of the necessary ingredients, fails to explain the observed asymmetry. By exploring the core principles and leading theoretical models, this article will provide a comprehensive overview of how this asymmetry could have arisen. The following chapters will first lay the theoretical groundwork, then explore its application in diverse physical scenarios, and finally provide practical calculation exercises. The journey begins in "Principles and Mechanisms" by detailing the three universal Sakharov conditions that any successful theory of [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) must satisfy. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" investigates how these conditions are realized in major theoretical frameworks like [electroweak baryogenesis](@entry_id:160851) and [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" offers a chance to engage directly with the quantitative aspects of these theories through guided problems.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The existence of a cosmic [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521)—the observed prevalence of matter over [antimatter](@entry_id:153431)—is one of the most profound and well-established facts in modern cosmology. This empirical reality stands in stark contrast to the symmetric [initial conditions](@entry_id:152863) predicted by standard [big bang](@entry_id:159819) cosmology and particle physics, where matter and [antimatter](@entry_id:153431) should have been produced in equal amounts, leading to near-total [annihilation](@entry_id:159364) and a universe devoid of the baryonic structures we observe today. To explain this asymmetry, a set of general conditions must be met by any viable physical theory. This chapter elucidates these fundamental principles and explores the primary theoretical mechanisms proposed to satisfy them.

### The Sakharov Conditions: A Universal Blueprint

In 1967, Andrei Sakharov first articulated the three necessary conditions for a dynamical generation of a net [baryon number](@entry_id:157941), starting from a symmetric universe. These conditions form the bedrock of all modern theories of [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277).

1.  **Baryon Number Violation:** The most self-evident requirement is that [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) ($B$) cannot be an exactly conserved quantity. If $B$ were conserved in all interactions, the net [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) of the universe, assumed to be initially zero, would have to remain zero for all time. Therefore, some physical process must exist that can change the net count of [baryons](@entry_id:193732). While the perturbative Standard Model of particle physics conserves [baryon number](@entry_id:157941), [non-perturbative effects](@entry_id:148492) associated with the electroweak sector, as we shall see, violate it.

2.  **C and CP Violation:** Charge conjugation (C) symmetry relates particles to their antiparticles, while parity (P) relates a process to its mirror image. The combined symmetry, CP, relates the dynamics of particles to those of their mirror-imaged [antiparticles](@entry_id:155666). If C-symmetry were exact, any process that produces a baryon would have a corresponding process that produces an antibaryon at the exact same rate. Similarly, if CP-symmetry were exact, a process creating a left-handed baryon, for example, would be perfectly balanced by a process creating a right-handed antibaryon at the same rate. Summing over all helicities would again lead to zero net baryon production. Therefore, to generate an asymmetry, both C and CP symmetries must be violated. The Standard Model contains a source of CP violation in the [quark mixing](@entry_id:153163) matrix (the CKM matrix), but its effects are many orders of magnitude too small to explain the observed [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521), pointing towards a need for new sources of CP violation in physics beyond the Standard Model.

3.  **Departure from Thermal Equilibrium:** Even with [baryon number violation](@entry_id:159472) and CP violation, a net asymmetry cannot be generated if the universe remains in perfect thermal equilibrium. The CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, guarantees that particles and [antiparticles](@entry_id:155666) have exactly the same mass. In thermal equilibrium, the [number density](@entry_id:268986) of a particle species is determined solely by its mass and chemical potential. If the universe started with zero net [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) (and thus zero baryonic chemical potential), it would remain in this state of maximum entropy unless a departure from equilibrium occurred. Such a departure provides a temporal directionality, allowing CP-violating interactions to yield a net effect. This condition can be satisfied either through the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy particles or during a violent, first-order cosmological phase transition.

### The Standard Model Anomaly: Sphalerons and B+L Violation

The Standard Model, despite its shortcomings for [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277), provides a crucial ingredient: [baryon number violation](@entry_id:159472). While the [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) current is conserved classically, it suffers from a [quantum anomaly](@entry_id:146580) in the presence of the $SU(2)_L$ weak [gauge fields](@entry_id:159627). This anomaly implies that the sum of [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) and lepton number, **$B+L$**, is violated, while the difference, **$B-L$**, is conserved.

This violation is physically realized through non-perturbative field configurations known as **sphalerons**. The vacuum structure of the $SU(2)_L$ gauge theory is complex, featuring an infinite set of degenerate ground states, each characterized by an integer topological quantity called the Chern-Simons number, $N_{CS}$. These distinct vacua are separated by a finite energy barrier. The [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) is the unstable, static, saddle-point solution to the classical equations of motion that sits at the top of this barrier. At high temperatures ($T$), thermal fluctuations can provide enough energy for the system to transition from one vacuum to another, for instance from $N_{CS}=0$ to $N_{CS}=1$. Each such transition changes baryon and lepton number by $\Delta B = \Delta L = 3 N_f$, where $N_f = 3$ is the number of fermion generations. Thus, [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes change $B$ and $L$ by 3 units each, violating $B+L$ while conserving $B-L$.

The rate of these transitions at high temperatures is unsuppressed, but in the electroweak broken phase ($T  T_{EW}$), the rate becomes exponentially suppressed:
$$ \Gamma_{B+L} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{E_{sph}}{T}\right) $$
Here, **$E_{sph}$** is the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy, which is proportional to the Higgs [vacuum expectation value](@entry_id:146340) (VEV), $v$. For the Standard Model, $E_{sph} \approx \frac{2\pi v}{g} B(m_h^2/m_W^2)$, where $B$ is a numerically computed function, $g$ is the $SU(2)_L$ coupling, and $m_h$ and $m_W$ are the Higgs and W-boson masses. In extensions of the Standard Model, such as a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy depends on the detailed structure of the scalar potential. For instance, in a 2HDM, the [effective potential](@entry_id:142581) for the Higgs field acquiring the VEV can be written with an effective quartic coupling $\lambda_{eff}$ that is a combination of the fundamental couplings of the model, directly impacting the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy and thus the washout rate of any generated asymmetry [@problem_id:808860].

The [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) configuration itself is a dynamic object. Its shape and energy can be influenced by background conditions. In a hypothetical scenario with a strong primordial hypermagnetic field, for example, the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) solution deforms from a spherical shape into a tube-like configuration, and its energy can be calculated using [variational methods](@entry_id:163656), demonstrating the adaptability of these non-perturbative structures to their environment [@problem_id:808822]. Furthermore, the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) rate can be affected by pre-existing particle asymmetries. A background chemical potential for fermions coupling to the $SU(2)_L$ fields, such as left-handed top quarks, introduces a term in the [effective action](@entry_id:145780) proportional to the Chern-Simons density. Since the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) configuration has a non-zero Chern-Simons number ($N_{CS,sph} = 1/2$), this term shifts the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy, thereby altering the [transition rate](@entry_id:262384). This feedback mechanism highlights the coupled dynamics between asymmetries and the processes that violate them [@problem_id:808782].

### Mechanism I: Electroweak Baryogenesis

Electroweak [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) (EWBG) is a compelling scenario where the [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) is generated during the [electroweak phase transition](@entry_id:157670). For this mechanism to work, the phase transition must be strongly **first-order**.

A [first-order phase transition](@entry_id:144521) proceeds through the nucleation of bubbles of the true vacuum (the broken phase, where the Higgs field has a non-zero VEV, $\phi \neq 0$) within the false vacuum (the symmetric phase, $\phi = 0$). This process inherently involves a departure from thermal equilibrium. The effective potential for the Higgs field at finite temperature, $V_{\text{eff}}(\phi, T)$, must exhibit a potential barrier separating the two phases at the critical temperature, $T_c$. In the Standard Model, for the observed Higgs mass, the transition is a smooth crossover, not a [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013). New physics is therefore required. For instance, adding higher-dimensional operators to the Higgs potential, such as a $\phi^6$ term, can create the necessary barrier. The critical temperature, defined as the temperature where the symmetric and broken minima are degenerate, can be calculated from the parameters of this potential [@problem_id:808839].

The three Sakharov conditions are realized in the EWBG scenario as follows:
1.  **Departure from Equilibrium:** The expanding bubble walls are interfaces moving through the [primordial plasma](@entry_id:161751). Particles in the plasma interact with the wall, falling out of [local thermal equilibrium](@entry_id:147993). The bubble wall velocity, $v_w$, is determined by a balance between the driving pressure from the latent heat of the transition and the frictional forces exerted by the plasma. For example, particles that are massless outside the bubble but massive inside will be reflected by the wall, exerting a pressure. This hydrodynamic friction can be calculated, providing a [terminal velocity](@entry_id:147799) for the wall [@problem_id:808825].

2.  **C and CP Violation:** New sources of CP violation, originating from BSM physics (e.g., in a 2HDM), are required. These new interactions cause particles and [antiparticles](@entry_id:155666) to interact differently with the moving bubble wall. This results in a net flux of, for instance, left-handed quarks into the symmetric phase ahead of the wall, creating a chiral charge separation.

3.  **Baryon Number Violation:** The active [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes in the symmetric phase ($T > T_c$) encounter the chiral asymmetry created by the bubble wall. This asymmetry biases the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) transitions, leading to a net production of baryons over antibaryons. Once these baryons are swept up by the expanding bubble and enter the broken phase, the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes are exponentially suppressed, preserving the newly minted [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521). This "freeze-out" requires the phase transition to be sufficiently strong, which translates to a condition on the ratio of the Higgs VEV to the critical temperature, $v_c/T_c \gtrsim 1$.

### Mechanism II: Leptogenesis

Leptogenesis offers an elegant alternative, leveraging the same [see-saw mechanism](@entry_id:189557) proposed to explain the smallness of neutrino masses. In its simplest form (Type-I see-saw), one introduces heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos, $N_i$.

The core idea is to first generate a lepton asymmetry ($L$), which is then converted into a [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) ($B$) by the Standard Model's $B+L$ violating [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes, which conserve $B-L$. A non-zero $L$ (and zero initial $B$) implies a non-zero $B-L$. After sphalerons cease, they will have driven $B+L$ towards zero, but since $B-L$ is conserved, this results in a non-zero final [baryon number](@entry_id:157941), roughly $B \approx C_{sph}(B-L)$, where $C_{sph}$ is a numerical factor of order unity.

The Sakharov conditions are met within the heavy neutrino sector:
1.  **Lepton Number Violation:** The Majorana nature of the heavy neutrinos explicitly violates lepton number. A Majorana particle is its own [antiparticle](@entry_id:193607), and its interactions can change $L$ by two units.

2.  **CP Violation:** If the Yukawa couplings of the heavy neutrinos to the Standard Model Higgs and leptons are complex, the decay rates of $N_i$ into leptons and anti-leptons can differ. This is quantified by the CP asymmetry parameter, $\epsilon_i$, defined for the decay of $N_i$:
    $$ \epsilon_i = \frac{\Gamma(N_i \to L H) - \Gamma(N_i \to \bar{L} \bar{H})}{\Gamma(N_i \to L H) + \Gamma(N_i \to \bar{L} \bar{H})} $$
    This asymmetry arises from the interference between tree-level and one-loop decay diagrams. The calculation of $\epsilon_i$ depends on the specifics of the model. For instance, in theories with [extra dimensions](@entry_id:160819), one must sum over the contributions from the entire Kaluza-Klein tower of intermediate particles [@problem_id:808791]. In scenarios with nearly-degenerate heavy neutrinos, the CP asymmetry can be resonantly enhanced, a mechanism known as resonant [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520), making it possible to generate the required asymmetry even with lower heavy neutrino masses [@problem_id:808813].

3.  **Departure from Equilibrium:** This is achieved if the heavy neutrinos decay out of equilibrium. In the early universe, when $T \gg M_N$, the neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium. As the universe cools, if their decay rate, $\Gamma_N$, is smaller than the Hubble expansion rate, $H$, at $T \sim M_N$, they will fall out of equilibrium before they can decay. Their subsequent decays inject a net lepton number into the plasma.

The final asymmetry is determined by solving a set of coupled **Boltzmann equations** for the heavy [neutrino number density](@entry_id:160762) and the generated lepton asymmetry. The dynamics are governed by the interplay of decays, which source the asymmetry, and **washout** processes (inverse decays and $L$-violating scatterings), which tend to erase it. The efficiency of [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520) is often characterized by the decay parameter $K = \Gamma_N / H(T=M_N)$.

In the **weak washout regime** ($K \ll 1$), inverse decays are inefficient, and the final asymmetry is directly proportional to the CP parameter $\epsilon$. This calculation can be adapted to various cosmological histories, such as a kination-dominated era where the universe expands faster than in the standard [radiation-dominated era](@entry_id:261886), which can significantly alter the final asymmetry for a given set of particle physics parameters [@problem_id:808786].

In the **strong washout regime** ($K \gg 1$), the situation is more complex. Decays and inverse decays are rapid, keeping the heavy neutrinos close to their equilibrium abundance for some time. A net asymmetry is produced because the neutrino abundance, while close to equilibrium, is still slowly decreasing as the universe cools. The final asymmetry depends sensitively on the balance between this slow production and the strong washout, and its calculation requires solving the full coupled differential equations [@problem_id:808799].

### Alternative Pathways: CPT-Violating Baryogenesis

While out-of-equilibrium dynamics are central to the canonical mechanisms, the Sakharov conditions can be satisfied in other ways. One intriguing possibility is [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) from fundamental CPT violation. If CPT is not an exact symmetry of nature, particles and [antiparticles](@entry_id:155666) need not have the same mass.

Consider a model where a background vector field $b_\mu$ couples differently to [baryons](@entry_id:193732) and anti-baryons, inducing an [energy splitting](@entry_id:193178): $E_{B/\bar{B}}(p) = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2} \mp b_0$. Even if the universe remains in perfect thermal equilibrium, this energy difference leads to different equilibrium number densities for [baryons](@entry_id:193732) and anti-[baryons](@entry_id:193732). In a high-temperature plasma, assuming zero chemical potential, the net baryon [number density](@entry_id:268986) can be calculated directly by integrating the difference in Fermi-Dirac distributions over all momenta. For a small splitting $b_0 \ll T$, this results in a net baryon number density $\Delta n_B \propto g_B b_0 T^2$. This mechanism, sometimes called spontaneous [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) or equilibrium [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277), circumvents the need for a departure from thermal equilibrium by postulating a modification to the most [fundamental symmetries](@entry_id:161256) of quantum field theory [@problem_id:808798].

In summary, the quest to understand our [matter-dominated universe](@entry_id:158254) has led to a rich interplay between cosmology, quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241), and the search for new physics. The Sakharov conditions provide a clear roadmap, and while the Standard Model alone is insufficient, plausible and testable mechanisms like [electroweak baryogenesis](@entry_id:160851) and [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520) demonstrate how physics beyond the Standard Model can provide a compelling solution to this fundamental puzzle.
