## Introduction
The staggering imbalance between matter and antimatter in our cosmos presents one of the most significant unsolved problems in cosmology and particle physics. To explain this observed [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521), any successful theory must satisfy the three fundamental Sakharov conditions: [baryon number violation](@entry_id:159472), C and CP violation, and a departure from thermal equilibrium. While the Standard Model of particle physics offers hints, its mechanisms are insufficient on their own, pointing towards a knowledge gap that requires new theoretical insights.

This article explores a crucial piece of this puzzle: the non-perturbative violation of baryon and lepton number within the [electroweak theory](@entry_id:137910) itself. This phenomenon, known as [electroweak nonconservation](@entry_id:160648), provides a powerful mechanism that connects the generation of a particle-antiparticle asymmetry to the dynamics of the early universe.

Across the following chapters, we will build a comprehensive understanding of this topic. The "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will uncover the quantum origins of [baryon number violation](@entry_id:159472) through the [chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077) and explain the role of sphalerons, the topological field configurations that mediate these transitions. It will then detail the two leading paradigms built upon this principle: [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520) and [electroweak baryogenesis](@entry_id:160851). Subsequently, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate how these theoretical concepts serve as powerful tools to probe physics beyond the Standard Model and create fascinating links to plasma physics and the origin of [cosmic magnetic fields](@entry_id:159962). Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" chapter will allow you to apply these principles through guided problems, calculating key quantities that govern the efficiency of [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) in the early universe.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The generation of the observed [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) of the Universe stands as one of the most profound puzzles in [modern cosmology](@entry_id:752086). As established in the introductory chapter, any successful mechanism of [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) must satisfy the three Sakharov conditions: [baryon number violation](@entry_id:159472), C and CP violation, and a departure from thermal equilibrium. While the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics contains sources of CP violation and can support out-of-equilibrium dynamics during the [electroweak phase transition](@entry_id:157670), the violation of [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) is more subtle. This chapter delves into the principles and mechanisms underpinning this violation and explores the leading paradigms for how it may have given rise to the [matter-antimatter asymmetry](@entry_id:151107) we observe today.

### The Electroweak Anomaly and B+L Nonconservation

At the classical level, both [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) ($B$) and lepton number ($L$) are [conserved quantities](@entry_id:148503) in the Standard Model. However, this is no longer true at the quantum level. The coupling of fermions to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge fields gives rise to a quantum mechanical **[chiral anomaly](@entry_id:142077)**. This anomaly implies that the currents associated with [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) and lepton number, $J_B^\mu$ and $J_L^\mu$, are not conserved. Instead, their divergences are proportional to the same combination of electroweak [gauge field](@entry_id:193054) strengths:

$$
\partial_\mu J_B^\mu = \partial_\mu J_L^\mu = \frac{N_f g^2}{32\pi^2} W_{\mu\nu}^a \tilde{W}^{a\mu\nu} - \frac{N_f g'^2}{32\pi^2} B_{\mu\nu} \tilde{B}^{\mu\nu}
$$

Here, $W_{\mu\nu}^a$ and $B_{\mu\nu}$ are the field strength tensors for the $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$ [gauge fields](@entry_id:159627), respectively, with couplings $g$ and $g'$. Their duals are denoted by a tilde, e.g., $\tilde{W}^{a\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} W_{\rho\sigma}^a$. The term $N_f$ represents the number of fermion generations, which is 3 in the Standard Model.

The quantity $W\tilde{W} - B\tilde{B}$ is a [total derivative](@entry_id:137587), meaning it can be written as the divergence of a current, $K^\mu$, known as the **Chern-Simons current**. The integral of its time component, $K^0$, over all space gives the **Chern-Simons number**, $N_{CS}$. This number is a topological invariant that characterizes the vacuum structure of the [gauge theory](@entry_id:142992). The change in baryon and lepton number is therefore directly related to the change in this topological number:

$$
\Delta B = \Delta L = N_f \Delta N_{CS}
$$

Crucially, this relation implies that while $B$ and $L$ are violated individually, the combination **$B-L$ is strictly conserved** by electroweak anomaly processes. This observation is of paramount importance: if the Universe began with $B-L=0$, any process that generates a net [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) must also generate a net lepton number. This provides a deep connection between the [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) and the lepton sector.

### The Sphaleron: A Gateway for Baryon Number Violation

The [electroweak theory](@entry_id:137910) possesses a non-trivial vacuum structure. The vacua are distinguished by integer values of the Chern-Simons number, $N_{CS} \in \mathbb{Z}$. These vacua are physically equivalent and separated by finite energy barriers. For a transition between two vacua with different $N_{CS}$ to occur, the system must traverse an intermediate, high-energy field configuration.

The minimum energy configuration on the path between adjacent topological vacua is a static, unstable saddle-point solution to the classical field equations known as the **[sphaleron](@entry_id:161609)**. The [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) is not a particle, but a topologically non-trivial field configuration. Its energy, $E_{sph}$, represents the height of the energy barrier that must be overcome for a $B+L$ violating transition to occur.

The [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy in the Standard Model is proportional to the [electroweak symmetry breaking](@entry_id:161363) scale, the Higgs [vacuum expectation value](@entry_id:146340) (VEV) $v$, and inversely proportional to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling $g$:

$$
E_{sph} = \frac{2\pi v}{g} \mathcal{B}\left(\frac{\lambda}{g^2}\right) \approx \frac{8\pi v}{g}
$$

where $\mathcal{B}$ is a numerical function of the ratio of the Higgs self-coupling $\lambda$ to $g^2$, which evaluates to a number of order unity for the physical parameters.

Calculating the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy is a central task in many theories. It involves finding a saddle-point solution to the static energy functional. For example, in a Left-Right Symmetric Model with an $SU(2)_R$ [gauge group](@entry_id:144761) broken by a Higgs triplet $\Delta_R$ with VEV $v_R$, the energy of the corresponding $SU(2)_R$ [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) can be estimated using a variational [ansatz](@entry_id:184384) for the gauge and Higgs fields. By substituting [trial functions](@entry_id:756165) for the field profiles into the [energy functional](@entry_id:170311) and minimizing with respect to a variational parameter, one can obtain a robust estimate of the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy. Such calculations consistently find the scaling $E_{sph} \propto v_R/g_R$, confirming the general principle in more complex models [@problem_id:823514].

At finite temperature $T$, thermal fluctuations can provide the energy needed to surmount this barrier. The rate of [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) transitions per unit volume, $\Gamma_{sph}$, is given by:

$$
\Gamma_{sph} \approx \kappa (\alpha_W T)^4 \exp\left(-\frac{E_{sph}(T)}{T}\right)
$$

where $\alpha_W = g^2/(4\pi)$ and $\kappa$ is a numerical prefactor. In the **symmetric phase** of the early Universe (at temperatures above the electroweak scale, $T > T_c$), the Higgs VEV is zero, $v(T)=0$, leading to the disappearance of the energy barrier. Consequently, [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) transitions are rapid and unsuppressed, and $B+L$ is efficiently violated. In the **broken phase** ($T  T_c$), a non-zero VEV develops, $v(T) > 0$, and the rate becomes exponentially suppressed. The [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes effectively "freeze out".

This exponential sensitivity to the Higgs VEV has profound consequences in various cosmological scenarios. For instance, in models with [extra dimensions](@entry_id:160819), such as Randall-Sundrum models, the effective Higgs VEV can be tied to the dynamics of other fields, like the radion. If the radion field evolves with time, the [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) energy barrier and, consequently, the [transition rate](@entry_id:262384) become time-dependent. Calculating the total number of [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) events over a cosmological epoch then requires integrating the rate over time, properly accounting for the changing VEV [@problem_id:823537].

### Leptogenesis: Generating Baryons from Leptons

The conservation of $B-L$ by [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes provides the foundation for the most widely-favored mechanism for [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277): **[leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520)**. The logic is elegant:

1.  At a very high temperature, create a net lepton asymmetry ($L \neq 0$) but with zero [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) ($B=0$). This gives the Universe a non-zero $B-L$.
2.  At a later stage, when the Universe is at a temperature $T > T_c$, active electroweak sphalerons re-process this lepton asymmetry. Since they strive to erase any $B+L$ asymmetry, they convert a portion of the lepton number into [baryon number](@entry_id:157941) to bring the system closer to the equilibrium condition $B+L \approx 0$.
3.  As the Universe cools and the [electroweak phase transition](@entry_id:157670) completes ($T  T_c$), the sphalerons freeze out, locking in the generated [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521).

The challenge is thus shifted to generating a primordial lepton asymmetry. The canonical mechanism involves the out-of-equilibrium, CP-violating decays of heavy, right-handed Majorana neutrinos, often denoted $N_i$. These are gauge-singlet fermions, naturally predicted by seesaw models that explain the smallness of light neutrino masses. Being Majorana particles, they violate lepton number explicitly.

The generation of the asymmetry is a dynamic process governed by a set of coupled **Boltzmann equations**. These equations track the number densities of the heavy neutrinos, $n_N$, and the lepton asymmetry, $n_{L}$. The core of the process involves the competition between the CP-violating decays of $N$ (e.g., $N \to L+H$) that source the asymmetry, and inverse processes (inverse decays and scatterings) that tend to erase it, or **washout** the asymmetry.

A crucial condition for net asymmetry production is that the decays occur **out of equilibrium**. This is quantified by the decay parameter $K = \Gamma_N / H(T=M_N)$, where $\Gamma_N$ is the decay rate and $H$ is the Hubble rate at a temperature equal to the [neutrino mass](@entry_id:149593) $M_N$. If $K \ll 1$ (the "weak washout" regime), decays are slow compared to the expansion of the Universe, and the neutrinos decay out-of-equilibrium, efficiently producing an asymmetry. If $K \gg 1$ (the "strong washout" regime), the system remains close to equilibrium, and the final asymmetry is suppressed.

The rate of washout processes is a key input to the Boltzmann equations. For example, a lepton number violating process like $l + \chi \to H + \phi$, mediated by some new physics, would contribute to erasing a pre-existing electron-lepton asymmetry. Calculating its thermally averaged reaction rate density, $\gamma$, requires integrating the squared [matrix element](@entry_id:136260) $|\mathcal{M}|^2$ over the phase space of the interacting particles, weighted by their thermal distributions. Such calculations are a cornerstone of studying cosmological relics and asymmetries, connecting microscopic particle physics parameters to macroscopic [cosmological observables](@entry_id:747921) [@problem_id:823521].

The source term for the lepton asymmetry in the Boltzmann equations is proportional to the CP asymmetry parameter $\epsilon$ and the deviation of the heavy neutrino [distribution function](@entry_id:145626), $f_N(p, T)$, from its equilibrium form. A precise calculation must account for the full momentum dependence of this deviation. While simple approximations are often used, a more rigorous treatment shows that the net rate of lepton generation depends on a momentum-weighted integral of the deviation, $\delta f_N$. The simplifying assumption that $\delta f_N$ has the same momentum dependence as the [equilibrium distribution](@entry_id:263943) can lead to corrections, especially at lower temperatures ($T \ll M_N$), highlighting the subtleties involved in solving the full kinetic equations [@problem_id:823586].

The physics of [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520) can be further enriched by considering more complex scenarios:
-   **Resonant Leptogenesis**: If two of the heavy neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass ($|M_1 - M_2| \sim \Gamma$), the CP asymmetry can be resonantly enhanced. This allows for successful [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520) at much lower mass scales. In this regime, thermal effects become critical. The finite decay widths of the heavy neutrinos, when included in their propagators, lead to new contributions to the CP asymmetry, sometimes called "phantom terms," which can compete with or even dominate the standard contribution [@problem_id:823567].
-   **Flavored Leptogenesis**: A realistic treatment must account for the different flavors of leptons. Quantum coherence between the heavy [neutrino mass](@entry_id:149593) eigenstates, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of their [density matrix](@entry_id:139892), plays a vital role. Interactions with the thermal plasma, such as scatterings involving the top quark Yukawa coupling, can act as "measurements" that destroy this coherence, a process known as **decoherence**. The decoherence rate must be compared to the [oscillation frequency](@entry_id:269468) to determine if flavor effects are important [@problem_id:823536].
-   **Non-Markovian Effects**: The standard Boltzmann equations are a Markovian approximation, assuming that interactions are instantaneous. In reality, quantum interactions have a finite duration, leading to memory effects. A more fundamental description based on Kadanoff-Baym equations reveals that these non-Markovian effects introduce corrections to the source term for the lepton asymmetry, modifying the final prediction [@problem_id:823565].

### Electroweak Baryogenesis

An alternative paradigm is **[electroweak baryogenesis](@entry_id:160851) (EWBG)**, where the [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) is generated directly during the [electroweak phase transition](@entry_id:157670). This mechanism requires the phase transition to be strongly **first-order**. A [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013) proceeds through the [nucleation](@entry_id:140577) and expansion of bubbles of the broken phase ($\phi \neq 0$) within the surrounding symmetric phase ($\phi = 0$).

The requirement of a strong [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013) is crucial. If the transition is not strong enough, [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) processes will remain active inside the broken phase bubbles after they form, washing out any asymmetry that is generated. The criterion for [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) preservation is that the rate of [sphaleron](@entry_id:161609) transitions in the broken phase at the critical temperature, $T_c$, is sufficiently suppressed. This translates to a condition on the strength of the transition, $\xi_c = \phi_c / T_c \gtrsim 1$, where $\phi_c$ is the Higgs VEV at the critical temperature.

In the Standard Model, the phase transition is a smooth crossover, not a [first-order transition](@entry_id:155013). Therefore, EWBG requires new physics near the electroweak scale. For example, in supersymmetric models, the presence of light stop squarks can modify the Higgs [effective potential](@entry_id:142581) at finite temperature, introducing a cubic term ($\propto \phi^3$) that can generate the necessary [potential barrier](@entry_id:147595) between the symmetric and broken phases. The strength of the transition, $\xi_c$, can then be calculated directly from the parameters of this effective potential, and for certain parameter choices, the condition $\xi_c > 1$ can be satisfied [@problem_id:823519].

In this scenario, the expanding bubble walls provide the necessary departure from thermal equilibrium. As particles from the plasma pass through the wall, they interact with the spatially varying Higgs field. If these interactions violate CP, they can create a net flux of left-handed chiral charge. This chiral asymmetry then biases the [electroweak sphaleron](@entry_id:160266) processes, which are still active in the symmetric phase ahead of the wall, to produce more baryons than antibaryons.

The CP-violating [source term](@entry_id:269111) arises from the quantum mechanical interaction of fermions with the complex, spacetime-dependent mass term provided by the Higgs field in the bubble wall, $m(z) = m_0(z) e^{i\theta(z)\gamma_5}$. A semiclassical WKB approach can be used to calculate the source for the axial charge density. This source is proportional to the wall velocity $v_w$, the spatial derivative of the CP-violating phase $d\theta/dz$, and a thermal function that depends on the [fermion mass](@entry_id:159379) and temperature. By integrating this source over the wall profile, one can find the total CP-violating charge separation per unit area of the wall, which ultimately sources the [baryon asymmetry](@entry_id:161521) [@problem_id:823563]. In a simplified sense, the interaction of fermions with the [topological defect](@entry_id:161750) of the bubble wall, much like the interaction of fermions with a kink in a toy model can lead to physical effects like mass shifts, is the engine of baryon production in EWBG [@problem_id:823580].

In summary, the non-perturbative nature of the [electroweak theory](@entry_id:137910) provides a concrete mechanism for [baryon number violation](@entry_id:159472) via sphalerons. This principle is the linchpin of modern [baryogenesis](@entry_id:160277) theories, either by converting a pre-existing lepton asymmetry in [leptogenesis](@entry_id:153520) models or by directly participating in asymmetry generation during the [electroweak phase transition](@entry_id:157670) itself. While the details are complex and often require physics beyond the Standard Model, the fundamental principles provide a robust and compelling framework for understanding our matter-dominated Universe.
