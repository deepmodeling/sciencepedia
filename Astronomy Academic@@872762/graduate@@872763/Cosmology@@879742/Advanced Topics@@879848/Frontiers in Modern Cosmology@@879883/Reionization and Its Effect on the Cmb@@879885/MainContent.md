## Introduction
After the [cosmic dark ages](@entry_id:159774), the light from the first stars and galaxies instigated the universe's last major phase transition: the [epoch of reionization](@entry_id:161482). This process, in which [neutral hydrogen](@entry_id:174271) was re-ionized, profoundly transformed the cosmos from opaque to transparent and left a complex set of imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Understanding these signatures is crucial, as they provide a unique observational window into the formation of the first luminous structures and [the thermal history of the universe](@entry_id:204719). However, disentangling these faint, secondary effects from the primordial CMB signal presents a significant theoretical and observational challenge. This article provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between [reionization](@entry_id:158356) and the CMB.

The following chapters will guide you through this fascinating subject. The "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter will dissect the fundamental physics of how [reionization](@entry_id:158356) modifies the CMB, from the global damping of anisotropies to the generation of large-scale polarization and the subtle signatures arising from its patchy, inhomogeneous nature. Next, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will explore how these CMB effects are used as powerful tools in [modern cosmology](@entry_id:752086), serving as probes of galaxy formation, primordial non-Gaussianity, and exotic physics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers a chance to engage with these concepts directly through guided theoretical exercises, solidifying your understanding of this pivotal era in cosmic history.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Following the [cosmic dawn](@entry_id:157658), the light from the [first stars](@entry_id:158491) and galaxies initiated a landmark phase transition in the universe's history: the [epoch of reionization](@entry_id:161482). During this era, the [neutral hydrogen](@entry_id:174271) and helium that pervaded the [intergalactic medium](@entry_id:157642) (IGM) were once again ionized by energetic photons. This process fundamentally altered the optical properties of the cosmos, transforming it from an opaque state for Lyman-series photons to the transparent state we observe today. The free electrons liberated during [reionization](@entry_id:158356) left a distinct and complex set of imprints on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), providing a unique observational window into this crucial period. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles and physical mechanisms through which [reionization](@entry_id:158356) modifies the CMB, from its global effects on temperature and polarization to the subtle signatures of its inhomogeneous nature.

### Global Signatures: Damping and Large-Scale Polarization

The most direct consequence of a reionized IGM is that CMB photons, which have traveled largely unimpeded since the [epoch of recombination](@entry_id:158245), now have a non-zero probability of scattering off free electrons. This Thomson scattering process has two primary "global" effects on the observed CMB anisotropies.

First, scattering events randomly redirect photons, blurring any primordial temperature and polarization patterns that were imprinted at the [last scattering surface](@entry_id:157701). This leads to a suppression, or **damping**, of the primordial anisotropy power spectra. For a given line of sight, the probability of a photon *not* scattering between us and the [last scattering surface](@entry_id:157701) is $e^{-\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the total **Thomson scattering optical depth**. Since power spectra are quadratic in the anisotropy fields, the primordial CMB power spectra are uniformly damped by a factor of $e^{-2\tau}$. This effect is most prominent at small angular scales (high multipoles, $\ell$), where the primordial anisotropies are sharpest. The total observed temperature power spectrum at high $\ell$, $C_\ell$, is therefore a combination of this damped primordial signal and new anisotropies generated during and after [reionization](@entry_id:158356). This can be modeled as:

$C_\ell = A_s e^{-2\tau} \mathcal{C}_\ell^{\text{p}} + C_\ell^{\text{secondary}}$

where $A_s$ is the intrinsic amplitude of primordial [scalar perturbations](@entry_id:160338) and $\mathcal{C}_\ell^{\text{p}}$ is the [primordial power spectrum](@entry_id:159340) shape. This equation reveals a fundamental **parameter degeneracy**: the observed amplitude of the CMB [acoustic peaks](@entry_id:746227) depends on the combination $A_s e^{-2\tau}$. Disentangling the primordial amplitude from the optical depth requires independent information, a challenge we will revisit [@problem_id:845650].

The second, and perhaps more informative, global effect is the generation of **new polarization anisotropies**. Thomson scattering generates [linear polarization](@entry_id:273116) if, and only if, the incident [radiation field](@entry_id:164265) as seen by the scattering electron has a non-zero quadrupole moment. During [reionization](@entry_id:158356), a local quadrupole anisotropy in the CMB temperature field is present on large scales, primarily due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect sourced by the evolution of gravitational potential perturbations. The scattering of this large-scale quadrupole by the newly liberated electrons generates a distinctive polarization signal on large angular scales, often called the **[reionization](@entry_id:158356) bump**.

### The E-Mode Polarization Reionization Bump

To quantitatively understand the generation of polarization during [reionization](@entry_id:158356), we must model when and where the scattering events occur. This is encapsulated by the **[visibility function](@entry_id:756540)**, $g(\eta) = \dot{\tau}e^{-\tau}$, which represents the probability density of a CMB photon last scattering at a given [conformal time](@entry_id:263727) $\eta$.

A simple yet insightful model treats [reionization](@entry_id:158356) as an instantaneous event occurring at a single [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z_{re}$, corresponding to [conformal time](@entry_id:263727) $\eta_{re}$. In this optically thin limit ($\tau \ll 1$), the [visibility function](@entry_id:756540) can be approximated as a Dirac delta function: $g(\eta) = \tau_{re} \delta(\eta - \eta_{re})$, where $\tau_{re}$ is the total [optical depth](@entry_id:159017) contributed by this event. The large-scale temperature quadrupole that sources this polarization is itself generated by the time evolution of [gravitational potential](@entry_id:160378) perturbations $\Phi$. The resulting E-mode [angular power spectrum](@entry_id:161125), $C_l^{EE}$, can be derived from the [primordial power spectrum](@entry_id:159340) of the gravitational potential, $\mathcal{P}_\Phi(k)$, which we assume to be scale-invariant, $\mathcal{P}_\Phi(k) = A_\Phi$.

The calculation involves integrating the source of polarization over cosmic time, weighted by the [visibility function](@entry_id:756540) and projected onto the [celestial sphere](@entry_id:158268) using spherical Bessel functions. For instantaneous [reionization](@entry_id:158356), the E-mode transfer function $\Delta_l^E(k)$ simplifies to:

$\Delta_l^E(k) = \int_0^{\eta_0} d\eta \, g(\eta) j_l'(k(\eta_0-\eta)) = \tau_{re} j_l'(k(\eta_0-\eta_{re}))$

where $j_l'(x)$ is the derivative of the spherical Bessel function with respect to its argument. Substituting this into the general expression for the [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) and performing the integral over all comoving wavenumbers $k$ yields a [closed-form expression](@entry_id:267458) for the large-scale E-mode power spectrum generated during [reionization](@entry_id:158356) [@problem_id:912375]:

$C_l^{EE} = 2\pi A_\Phi \tau_{re}^2 \frac{l(l+1)}{(2l-1)(2l+1)(2l+3)}$

for multipoles $l \ge 2$. This spectrum has a characteristic shape, peaking at the lowest multipoles ($l \sim 2-10$) and falling off rapidly at higher $l$. The amplitude of this "[reionization](@entry_id:158356) bump" is proportional to $\tau_{re}^2$, providing a powerful method to measure the total optical depth and break the $A_s-\tau$ degeneracy.

Of course, [reionization](@entry_id:158356) was not an instantaneous process; it was extended over a finite duration in redshift. We can refine our model by describing the [visibility function](@entry_id:756540) as a Gaussian in [redshift](@entry_id:159945), $g(z)$, with a mean [redshift](@entry_id:159945) $z_{re}$ and a standard deviation $\sigma_z$ that characterizes its duration. This finite duration means that the "[last scattering surface](@entry_id:157701)" for [reionization](@entry_id:158356) is smeared out. This smearing leads to a suppression of power at smaller angular scales (larger $l$), effectively damping the [reionization](@entry_id:158356) bump. The effect can be modeled by a multiplicative damping factor, $D_l^2 \approx \exp( -\ell(\ell+1) \Theta)$, where the [damping parameter](@entry_id:167312) $\Theta$ depends on the ratio of the duration of [reionization](@entry_id:158356) in [conformal time](@entry_id:263727), $\sigma_\eta$, to the conformal [lookback time](@entry_id:260844) to the [reionization](@entry_id:158356) epoch, $\eta_0 - \eta_{re}$. Assuming a flat, [matter-dominated universe](@entry_id:158254), one can relate these [conformal time](@entry_id:263727) quantities to the redshift parameters, yielding [@problem_id:912961]:

$\Theta = \left( \frac{\sigma_\eta}{\eta_0 - \eta_{re}} \right)^2 = \frac{\sigma_z^2}{4(1+z_{re})^3\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z_{re}}}\right)^2}$

This result demonstrates that the amplitude of the [reionization](@entry_id:158356) bump constrains the total [optical depth](@entry_id:159017) $\tau$, while its shape (specifically, the fall-off at high $l$) constrains the duration of the [reionization](@entry_id:158356) epoch.

### Secondary Anisotropies from Bulk Flows

The [reionization](@entry_id:158356) epoch is not only a screen for scattering primordial anisotropies but also a source of new, secondary anisotropies generated by the physical conditions within the ionized medium itself. A key ingredient is the peculiar velocity field of [baryons](@entry_id:193732), $\mathbf{v}_b$.

The **kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect** is the Doppler shift imparted to CMB photons as they scatter off electrons with a non-zero line-of-sight velocity. This generates new temperature fluctuations, $S_{kSZ} \propto \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}_b/c$. If the incident radiation field also possesses a quadrupole, this same scattering process can generate polarization, an effect known as the **polarized kSZ effect**. The [source function](@entry_id:161358) for this effect depends on both the [velocity field](@entry_id:271461) and the local radiation environment. By modeling the [source function](@entry_id:161358) for E-modes, for instance with a phenomenological form like $S_E(k, \eta) = A k^{-1} \delta(\eta - \eta_{re})$, we can calculate the resulting polarization [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996). This particular model, representing instantaneous [reionization](@entry_id:158356) with a specific velocity [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996), yields an E-mode spectrum with a distinct scale dependence, allowing it to be distinguished in principle from the primary [reionization](@entry_id:158356) bump [@problem_id:884505].

Another, more subtle effect is the **second-order Doppler effect**, which contributes a source term to the temperature anisotropy proportional to $(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}_b/c)^2$. While this is a second-order effect, it generates anisotropies with distinct statistical properties. Assuming the baryon [velocity field](@entry_id:271461) is a Gaussian [random field](@entry_id:268702) with a known power spectrum $P_v(k)$, one can calculate the total variance of the temperature anisotropies produced by this mechanism during an instantaneous [reionization](@entry_id:158356) event. This variance is proportional to the square of the velocity dispersion, $\sigma_v^4$, demonstrating a strong dependence on the clustering and motion of matter at the [reionization](@entry_id:158356) epoch [@problem_id:880482].

### The Signature of Inhomogeneity: Patchy Reionization

Reionization did not happen uniformly throughout the universe. It was a "patchy" process, with ionized bubbles forming around the first luminous sources and gradually growing until they overlapped and filled all of space. This spatial inhomogeneity in the free electron density, $\delta n_e(\mathbf{x})$, leads to corresponding fluctuations in the Thomson optical depth, $\delta\tau(\hat{\mathbf{n}})$, along different lines of sight.

This patchiness has profound consequences, most notably the generation of **B-mode polarization**. The primordial CMB is expected to have very little B-mode power. However, as the primordial E-mode polarization pattern propagates through the patchy [reionization](@entry_id:158356) screen, the spatially varying optical depth can induce a conversion of E-modes into B-modes. The mechanism is analogous to [birefringence](@entry_id:167246): a gradient in the [optical depth](@entry_id:159017) transverse to the line of sight can effectively "rotate" the polarization plane of the scattered light.

The resulting B-mode [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996), $C_\ell^{BB}$, can be calculated by coupling the primordial E-mode power, $C_{\ell_1}^{EE}$, with the [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) of the [ionization](@entry_id:136315) fraction fluctuations, $C_{\ell_2}^{\delta_x \delta_x}$. The coupling is mediated by geometric factors related to the Wigner 3-j symbols. For instance, if we model the primordial E-modes as being dominated by the quadrupole ($\ell_1=2$) and the ionization fluctuations as having a specific [power-law spectrum](@entry_id:186309), we can compute the expected B-mode power at the quadrupole scale, $C_2^{BB}$ [@problem_id:833852]. The detection of such a B-mode signal on large to intermediate scales would be a smoking-gun signature of patchy [reionization](@entry_id:158356) and provide invaluable information about the size and distribution of the ionized bubbles.

A complementary perspective is offered by the flat-sky approximation, useful for smaller angular scales. Here, the B-mode generation is described as a convolution between the E-mode power spectrum and the [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) of optical depth fluctuations, $C_L^{\delta\tau}$. A key insight is that the conversion efficiency depends on the sine of twice the angle between the E-mode wavevector and the wavevector of the optical depth fluctuation. If we model the primordial E-modes as a sharp acoustic peak at multipole $\ell_p$ and the [optical depth](@entry_id:159017) fluctuations as being sourced by a scale-invariant power spectrum of its transverse gradient ($C_L^{|\nabla_{\perp}\delta\tau|} = K$), the generated B-mode power at the scale of the acoustic peak, $L = \ell_p$, is found to be $C_{\ell_p}^B = \mathcal{E}K/(4\pi\ell_p)$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is the power in the E-mode peak [@problem_id:845676]. This shows that the B-mode power directly probes the [power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) of the [optical depth](@entry_id:159017) gradients, which encode the [morphology](@entry_id:273085) of the [reionization](@entry_id:158356) process.

### Beyond the Power Spectrum: Non-Gaussianity

Since the observed CMB temperature is a product of the primordial signal and a spatially varying transmission factor, $\Theta^{\text{obs}}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}) \approx \Theta^{\text{pri}}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}) (1 - \delta\tau(\hat{\mathbf{n}}))$, the resulting CMB map is no longer a purely Gaussian [random field](@entry_id:268702). This product of two (largely) Gaussian fields, $\Theta^{\text{pri}}$ and $\delta\tau$, generates a specific form of **non-Gaussianity**.

The primary tool for quantifying this non-Gaussianity is the **[bispectrum](@entry_id:158545)**, or three-point [correlation function](@entry_id:137198) in harmonic space, $b_{l_1 l_2 l_3}$. For the modulation effect described, the bispectrum is generated by the correlation between the primordial field and the optical depth field. In the **squeezed limit**, where one multipole is much smaller than the other two ($l_1 \ll l_2 \approx l_3$), the [bispectrum](@entry_id:158545) takes on a particularly simple form. This limit corresponds physically to the [modulation](@entry_id:260640) of small-scale power ($l_2, l_3$) by a large-scale mode ($l_1$). The bispectrum in this regime is directly proportional to the product of the large-scale cross-[power spectrum](@entry_id:159996) between temperature and optical depth, $C_{l_1}^{\Theta\tau}$, and the small-scale temperature auto-power spectrum, $C_{l_3}^{\Theta\Theta}$ [@problem_id:845704]:

$b_{l_1 l_3 l_3} \propto - C_{l_1}^{\Theta\tau} C_{l_3}^{\Theta\Theta}$

Measuring a squeezed-limit bispectrum with this characteristic form would provide powerful evidence for patchy [reionization](@entry_id:158356) and allow us to probe the [cross-correlation](@entry_id:143353) between the large-scale density fields that source [reionization](@entry_id:158356) and the primordial temperature fluctuations.

### Observational Challenges and Parameter Estimation

While the effects of [reionization](@entry_id:158356) are rich with physical information, extracting this information from CMB data is a complex statistical challenge. As mentioned earlier, the damping of primordial power by $e^{-2\tau}$ is degenerate with the primordial amplitude $A_s$. While the large-scale polarization bump helps break this degeneracy by providing an independent measure of $\tau$, the picture is complicated by other secondary anisotropies. For example, an unconstrained kSZ component at high $\ell$ can add power that mimics a lower value of $\tau$ or a higher value of $A_s$.

Cosmological [parameter estimation](@entry_id:139349) must therefore simultaneously fit for primordial parameters, [reionization](@entry_id:158356) parameters (like $\tau$ and $\sigma_z$), and the amplitudes of various secondary anisotropies. The Fisher [information matrix](@entry_id:750640) formalism provides a framework for forecasting the precision of such measurements and understanding the covariances between parameters. Even with perfect, cosmic-variance-limited measurements of the power spectrum, residual uncertainties in one parameter can propagate to others. For instance, if the [optical depth](@entry_id:159017) $\tau$ is constrained by an external prior with variance $\sigma_0^2$ (perhaps from the polarization bump or 21cm observations), the remaining uncertainty introduces a covariance with the estimated primordial amplitude $\hat{A}_s$ given by [@problem_id:845650]:

$\text{Cov}(\hat{A}_s, \hat{\tau}) = 2 A_s \sigma_0^2$

This simple relation underscores the intricate web of degeneracies that must be navigated in our quest to understand the [epoch of reionization](@entry_id:161482). The diverse signatures left on the CMB—from global damping and polarization to the subtle B-modes and non-Gaussianities of a patchy universe—collectively provide the crucial data needed to unravel this complex and pivotal chapter in cosmic history.
