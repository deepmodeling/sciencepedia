Therefore, the rate of $^8$B neutrino production, which we can denote $r_{^8\\text{B}}$, is directly proportional to the rate of the proton capture reaction on $^7\\text{Be}$, which we denote $r_{p,7}$. This problem investigates the sensitivity of this rate to the central pressure of a star like the Sun.\n\n**Model Assumptions:**\n1.  The stellar core at its center (subscript 'c') is a fully ionized plasma. It behaves as a non-degenerate ideal gas, where the central pressure $P_c$ and mass density $\\rho_c$ are related by the equation of state $P_c = \\frac{\\rho_c k_B T_c}{\\mu m_p}$. Here, $T_c$ is the central temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_p$ is the proton mass, and $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight.\n2.  The nucleus $^7$Be is in nuclear statistical equilibrium, meaning its production rate (from $^3\\text{He} + ^4\\text{He}$) is balanced by its total destruction rate (from $^7\\text{Be} + e^-$ and $^7\\text{Be} + p$).\n3.  The volumetric rate of a thermonuclear reaction between species $i$ and $j$ is given by $r_{ij} \\propto n_i n_j \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij}$, where $n_i$ is the number density of species $i$ and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij}$ is the thermally-averaged reaction rate per particle pair.\n4.  In the dense plasma, reaction rates are enhanced by a screening factor, $f_{scr}$, such that $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij} = \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{ij,0} f_{scr,ij}$, where the subscript '0' denotes the bare (unscreened) rate. The screening factor is given by $f_{scr} = \\exp(U_{scr} / k_B T_c)$, where $U_{scr}$ is the screening potential energy.\n5.  You may assume that the screening potential energy is approximately the same for the three reactions relevant to the $^7$Be equilibrium: $U_{scr,p+^7\\text{Be}} \\approx U_{scr,e^-+^7\\text{Be}} \\approx U_{scr,^3\\text{He}+^4\\text{He}} \\equiv U_{scr}$.\n6.  The screening potential energy $U_{scr}$ is primarily a function of density and temperature. At constant temperature, it is found to be proportional to the square root of the mass density: $U_{scr} \\propto \\rho_c^{1/2}$.\n7.  For this analysis, consider the central temperature $T_c$ and the plasma composition (i.e., mass fractions $X_k$ of all species and the mean molecular weight $\\mu$) to be constant.\n\n**Problem:**\nThe first-order dependence of the $^8$B production rate on the central pressure is defined by the power-law index $\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r_{^8\\text{B}}}{\\partial \\ln P_c}$. At constant central temperature $T_c$, derive a symbolic expression for $\\alpha$. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of the screening potential energy $U_{scr}$, the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, and the central temperature $T_c$.", "solution": "1.

The rate of $^8$B production is proportional to the proton capture rate on $^7$Be: $r_{^8\\text{B}} \\propto r_{p,7}$. In terms of number densities and the screened reaction rate, this is $r_{^8\\text{B}} \\propto n_p n_{^7\\text{Be}} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{p7} = n_p n_{^7\\text{Be}} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{p7,0} f_{scr}$.\n3. The equilibrium abundance of $^7$Be is found by balancing its production ($r_{34}$) and destruction ($r_{e7} + r_{p7}$): $r_{34} = r_{e7} + r_{p7}$.

The screening factor $f_{scr}$ is common to all terms (by assumption 5) and cancels out. Since all number densities $n_k \\propto \\rho_c$ and the bare rates $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle_{k,0}$ are constant at constant $T_c$, the equilibrium equation simplifies to $\\rho_c^2 \\propto n_{^7\\text{Be}} \\rho_c$. This yields the density dependence of the $^7$Be abundance: $n_{^7\\text{Be}} \\propto \\rho_c$.\n5.
