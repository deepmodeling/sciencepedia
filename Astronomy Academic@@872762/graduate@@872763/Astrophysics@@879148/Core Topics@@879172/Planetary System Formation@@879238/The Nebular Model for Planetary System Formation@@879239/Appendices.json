Solids, in the form of \"pebbles,\" drift radially inwards due to aerodynamic drag from the sub-Keplerian gas, while the gas itself viscously accretes onto the central star. This leads to a complex interplay governing the flux of heavy elements (metals) throughout the disk.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a steady-state, gaseous protoplanetary disk at a given radius $r$ from a central star of mass $M_*$. The disk contains two components: gas and a single population of solid pebbles.\n\nThe gas has a surface density $\\Sigma_g$ and a heavy element mass fraction $Z_g$. It flows radially inward with a velocity $v_{r,g}$ due to viscosity $\\nu$:\n$$v_{r,g} = - \\frac{3\\nu}{2r}$$\n\nThe pebbles are composed entirely of heavy elements and have a surface density $\\Sigma_p$. They are subject to gas drag, which causes them to drift radially inward relative to the gas. This relative drift velocity is given by:\n$$v_{drift} = -2\\eta v_K \\frac{St}{1+St^2}$$\nwhere $v_K = \\sqrt{GM_*/r}$ is the Keplerian velocity, $St$ is the dimensionless Stokes number of the pebbles, and $\\eta$ is a parameter quantifying the gas pressure support.

Here, $\\alpha$ is the dimensionless viscosity parameter, $c_s$ is the local sound speed, and $H$ is the gas pressure scale height. For a nearly Keplerian disk, the sound speed and Keplerian velocity are related to the orbital frequency $\\Omega_K = v_K/r$ by $c_s = H\\Omega_K$.
