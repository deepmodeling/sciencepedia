Each system consists of a single planet in a circular orbit of semi-major axis $a$ around a star of radius $R_s$. A key assumption is that the orbital orientations of these systems are random and isotropic, meaning the normal vector to any given planet's orbital plane is equally likely to point in any direction in space.\n\nThe impact parameter, $b$, is a dimensionless quantity that measures the sky-projected separation between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the time of conjunction. For a circular orbit, it is given by the relation $b = \\frac{a}{R_s} |\\cos i|$, where $i$ is the inclination of the orbit. The inclination $i$ is the angle between the normal to the orbital plane and the observer's line of sight.\n\nA transit is observed if the center of the planet passes in front of the stellar disk. This occurs when the impact parameter $b$ satisfies the condition $b \\le 1$. We are interested in the statistical properties of the sub-population of planets that are observed to transit.\n\nDerive the expectation value, $\\langle b \\rangle$, of the impact parameter for this population of transiting planets.", "solution": "1.
