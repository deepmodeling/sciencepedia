By determining the optimal fractal dimension, you will uncover the physical properties that allow aggregates to minimize their differential drift and continue their growth into planetesimals [@problem_id:250793].", "problem": "In the early stages of planet formation within a protoplanetary disk, dust grains grow into larger fractal aggregates. The radial drift of these aggregates towards the central star poses a significant barrier to their continued growth. The drift is caused by a headwind from the disk gas, which is partially pressure-supported and orbits at a sub-Keplerian velocity.\n\nAn aggregate's coupling to the gas is characterized by its dimensionless stopping time (Stokes number) $\\tau_s$. For small aggregates with sizes $r_a$ much smaller than the gas mean free path (the Epstein drag regime), the stopping time is given by $t_s = \\frac{\\bar{\\rho} r_a}{\\rho_g v_{th}}$, where $\\bar{\\rho}$ is the average internal density of the aggregate, $\\rho_g$ is the ambient gas density, and $v_{th}$ is the mean thermal velocity of gas molecules.

The core is isothermal, possessing a uniform temperature $T_c(t)$ at any given time $t$. This is due to vigorous convection or very high thermal conductivity within the core. The core has a uniform density $\\rho_c$ and specific heat capacity $c_c$.\n2.  The heat capacity of the mantle is negligible compared to that of the core. Consequently, the temperature profile within the mantle adjusts instantaneously to changes in the core's temperature. This means that at any time $t$, the heat flow through the mantle can be described by the steady-state heat conduction equation. The mantle has a uniform thermal conductivity $k_m$.\n3.
