This event is assumed to be instantaneous. During the explosion, the star ejects a mass shell of mass $\\Delta M$, leaving behind a compact remnant (a neutron star or black hole) of mass $M_1' = M_1 - \\Delta M$. The ejected mass is assumed to leave the system without gravitationally interacting with the remnant or the companion star further.

The interaction between the star's magnetosphere and the infalling plasma is critical in determining the star's rotational evolution.\n\nNear the neutron star, the plasma is channeled by the magnetic field. A characteristic boundary, the magnetospheric radius $r_m$, is established where the magnetic energy density of the stellar field balances the kinetic energy density of the infalling material.\n\nIn a specific phase known as the \"propeller\" regime, the magnetosphere rotates so rapidly that infalling matter is centrifugally ejected before it can reach the stellar surface.
