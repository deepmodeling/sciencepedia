Consider a binary system consisting of a white dwarf of mass $M_1$ and a companion star. The white dwarf is surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk. The binary system orbits its common center of mass with a period $P$ in a circular orbit, which is observed at an inclination angle $i$.\n\nThe gas in the accretion disk is assumed to follow circular Keplerian orbits around the white dwarf in the binary's orbital plane. The Keplerian velocity of a gas parcel at a radius $R$ from the white dwarf is $V_K = \\sqrt{G M_1 / R}$. The white dwarf itself orbits the center of mass with a speed $K_1$.\n\nDoppler tomography reconstructs an image in a 2D velocity space $(v_x, v_y)$. These velocity coordinates represent the components of the gas's inertial velocity vector, but resolved along the axes of a reference frame that co-rotates with the binary. In this co-rotating frame, the origin is at the binary's center of mass, and the $x$-axis always points from the white dwarf towards the companion star.\n\nFor any point in the disk, its instantaneous inertial velocity vector, when expressed in the basis of the co-rotating frame, is given by $(v_x, v_y)$. The entire set of these velocity vectors from a continuous structure (like a ring in the disk) forms a corresponding structure in the Doppler tomogram.\n\nDerive the equation of the curve in the $(v_x, v_y)$ velocity plane that represents the emission from a thin ring of gas in the accretion disk at a constant radius $R$ from the white dwarf.
