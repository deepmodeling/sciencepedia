The method, in its modern form, combines photometric and spectroscopic observations to determine the star's angular and linear radius variations, which can be combined to find the distance.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a radially pulsating star. Its pulsation is periodic with an angular frequency $\\omega$. The star's observed properties vary sinusoidally with time, $t$.\n\n**Assumptions and Given Information:**\n\n1.  **Spectroscopy:** The star's radial velocity, as measured by Doppler shifts, is observed to vary as:\n    $$v_{rad}(t) = -K \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n    where $K$ is the velocity amplitude, and the convention is that positive radial velocity corresponds to redshift (recession). The physical velocity of the star's surface, $v(t) = dR/dt$, is related to the observed radial velocity by the projection factor $p$, such that $v_{rad}(t) = -p \\cdot v(t)$. Assume the star's radius is $R(t) = R_0 + \\Delta R(t)$, where $R_0$ is the mean radius and $\\Delta R(0) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Photometry:** The relationship between the star's apparent magnitude in a particular passband, $m(t)$, its angular radius $\\theta(t) = R(t)/D$ (where $D$ is the distance to the star), and its surface brightness in that passband, $S(t)$, is given by:\n    $$m(t) = C - 5 \\log_{10}(\\theta(t)) + S(t)$$\n    where $C$ is a constant. Note that both $m$ and $S$ are in magnitudes, so a smaller value means greater brightness.\n\n3.  **Observed Variations:** The photometric variations around the mean values are observed to follow these forms:\n    -   Apparent magnitude variation: $\\Delta m(t) = m(t) - \\langle m \\rangle = A_m \\sin(\\omega t)$\n    -   Surface brightness variation: $\\Delta S(t) = S(t) - \\langle S \\rangle = A_S \\sin(\\omega t)$\n    Here, $A_m$ and $A_S$ are the observed positive amplitudes of the magnitude and surface brightness variations, respectively.\n\n4.  **Known Mean Angular Size:** From the mean apparent magnitude $\\langle m \\rangle$, the mean surface brightness $\\langle S \\rangle$, and an established surface brightness-color relation, the mean angular radius of the star, $\\theta_0 = R_0/D$, has been determined.\n\n5.  **Approximation:** All radius and photometric variations are small, so that for any small quantity $x$, the approximation $10^x \\approx 1 + x \\ln(10)$ is valid.\n\n**Task:**\n\nUsing the model and information provided, derive a closed-form expression for the distance $D$ to the star in terms of the observable amplitudes $K$, $A_m$, $A_S$, the angular frequency $\\omega$, the mean angular radius $\\theta_0$, and the projection factor $p$.", "solution": "1.

The P-L relation is calibrated by measuring the periods and mean apparent magnitudes of a sample of Cepheids at a known distance. An accurate determination of the mean magnitude is therefore paramount.\n\nCepheid light curves, which show the variation of magnitude over time, are characteristically asymmetric, often exhibiting a rapid rise to maximum brightness followed by a slower decline. A simplified, yet illustrative, model for a true Cepheid light curve is given by a two-term Fourier series:\n$$m_{\\text{true}}(t) = \\bar{m} - A_1 \\cos(\\omega t) - A_2 \\cos(2\\omega t)$$\nHere, $\\bar{m}$ is the true mean magnitude, $t$ is time, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of pulsation (related to the period $P$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi/P$), and $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the amplitudes of the fundamental mode and the first overtone, respectively.

The appropriate statistical weight for each data point is thus $w = 1/\\sigma_m^2 \\propto F$. The relationship between magnitude $m$ and flux $F$ is given by $m = -a \\ln(F/F_0)$, where $F_0$ is a reference flux and $a$ is a positive constant ($a = 2.5/\\ln 10$).
