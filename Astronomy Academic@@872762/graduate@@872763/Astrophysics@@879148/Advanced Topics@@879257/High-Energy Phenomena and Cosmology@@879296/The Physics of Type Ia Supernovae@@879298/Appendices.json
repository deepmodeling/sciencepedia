The explosion unbinds the star and synthesizes heavy elements, primarily $^{56}$Ni. We will model this process to derive the net kinetic energy of the resulting ejecta.\n\n**Model Assumptions:**\n1.  Just prior to the explosion, the white dwarf has a mass $M = M_{Ch}$ and is supported by non-relativistic electron degeneracy pressure. Its structure is well-approximated by an $n=3/2$ polytrope.\n2.  The gravitational binding energy, $E_{bind}$, of an $n=3/2$ polytropic star of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is given by the relation:\n    $$E_{bind} = \\frac{3}{7} \\frac{G M^2}{R}$$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n3.  For a white dwarf described by this model, the mass and radius are related by the expression:\n    $$R M^{1/3} = K$$\n    where $K$ is a constant that depends on the composition and fundamental physical constants.\n4.  The supernova explosion is powerful enough to completely unbind the star. During the explosion, a mass $M_{Ni}$ of $^{56}$Ni is synthesized from the initial carbon and oxygen.\n5.

The problem states that a mass $M_{Ni}$ of $^{56}$Ni is synthesized, and the specific energy release per unit mass of nickel is $\\epsilon_{Ni}$. Therefore, the total nuclear energy is the product of these two quantities:\n$$E_{nuc} = M_{Ni} \\epsilon_{Ni}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the gravitational binding energy, $E_{bind}$, of the white dwarf just before the explosion. The problem provides the formula for the binding energy of an $n=3/2$ polytrope:\n$$E_{bind} = \\frac{3}{7} \\frac{G M^2}{R}$$\nThe white dwarf is at the Chandrasekhar mass, so we substitute $M = M_{Ch}$:\n$$E_{bind} = \\frac{3}{7} \\frac{G M_{Ch}^2}{R}$$\nThis expression for $E_{bind}$ depends on the radius $R$ of the white dwarf, which is not one of the allowed final parameters.
