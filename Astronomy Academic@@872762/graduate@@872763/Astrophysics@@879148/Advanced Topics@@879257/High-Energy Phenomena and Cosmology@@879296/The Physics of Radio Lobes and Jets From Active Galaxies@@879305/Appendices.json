These jets move with a bulk Lorentz factor $\\Gamma \\gg 1$. The prominent non-thermal emission observed from these jets is understood to originate from a population of highly relativistic electrons within the jet plasma.\n\nIn the jet's rest frame, referred to as the comoving frame, these energetic electrons lose energy via several radiative mechanisms. Two of the most important are:\n1.  **Synchrotron (Syn) Radiation:** An electron with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma'$ relative to the comoving plasma spirals in the jet's entrained magnetic field, $B'$. This acceleration causes the electron to radiate. The total power emitted by a single electron via the synchrotron process is $P'_{Syn} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2 U'_B$, where $\\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross-section, $c$ is the speed of light, and $U'_B = \\frac{(B')^2}{8\\pi}$ is the energy density of the magnetic field in the comoving frame (in Gaussian cgs units).\n\n2.  **Inverse Compton (IC) Scattering:** The same relativistic electrons can scatter ambient, low-energy photons to much higher energies. A primary source of such photons is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Assuming the scattering occurs in the Thomson regime, the power radiated by an electron is given by a similar formula: $P'_{IC} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2 U'_{ph}$, where $U'_{ph}$ is the energy density of the ambient photon field as measured in the jet's comoving frame.\n\nThe CMB is an isotropic, blackbody radiation field in the cosmological rest frame (approximated as the observer's frame). It has a temperature $T_{CMB}$ and a corresponding energy density $U_{CMB} = a T_{CMB}^4$, where $a$ is the radiation constant. Due to relativistic effects, the energy density of this isotropic field as measured in the comoving frame of the jet is given by the transformation $U'_{ph} = \\Gamma^2 (1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\beta^2) U_{ph}$, where $\\beta = v/c$ is the jet's bulk speed and $\\Gamma = (1-\\beta^2)^{-1/2}$ is its bulk Lorentz factor.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider a blazar with an ultra-relativistic jet, such that its bulk velocity is approximately the speed of light ($\\beta \\approx 1$). Derive an expression for the comoving magnetic field strength, $B'_{eq}$, at which the cooling rate of a relativistic electron due to synchrotron radiation is precisely equal to its cooling rate due to inverse Compton scattering off the CMB. Express your final answer in terms of the jet's bulk Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$, the CMB temperature $T_{CMB}$, and the radiation constant $a$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the comoving magnetic field strength $B'_{eq}$ where the synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling rates are equal. The cooling rate of an electron is its rate of energy loss, which is equivalent to the power it radiates. Therefore, we need to set the synchrotron power equal to the inverse Compton power in the comoving frame.\n\nThe synchrotron power radiated by a single electron is given as:\n$$P'_{Syn} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2 U'_B$$\n\nThe inverse Compton power radiated by the same electron scattering CMB photons is:\n$$P'_{IC} = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2 U'_{CMB}$$\nwhere $U'_{CMB}$ is the energy density of the CMB in the comoving frame.\n\nThe condition for the cooling rates to be equal is $P'_{Syn} = P'_{IC}$:\n$$\\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2 U'_B = \\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2 U'_{CMB}$$\n\nThe factors of $\\frac{4}{3} \\sigma_T c (\\gamma')^2$ are common to both sides and cancel out. This implies that the condition for equality of the cooling rates is independent of the individual electron's energy (as long as it is relativistic and the scattering is in the Thomson regime). The condition simplifies to an equality of the energy densities in the comoving frame:\n$$U'_B = U'_{CMB}$$\n\nNow, we must express each energy density in terms of the given physical quantities. The magnetic field energy density in the comoving frame is given by:\n$$U'_B = \\frac{(B')^2}{8\\pi}$$\n\nFor the CMB energy density, we first find its value in the comoving frame, $U'_{CMB}$, by transforming its energy density from the observer's frame, $U_{CMB}$. The transformation rule is provided:\n$$U'_{CMB} = \\Gamma^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\beta^2\\right) U_{CMB}$$\nThe problem specifies that the jet is ultra-relativistic, which means $\\beta \\approx 1$. Substituting $\\beta=1$ into the transformation equation gives:\n$$U'_{CMB} = \\Gamma^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) U_{CMB} = \\frac{4}{3} \\Gamma^2 U_{CMB}$$\n\nThe energy density of the CMB in the observer's frame is given as $U_{CMB} = a T_{CMB}^4$. Substituting this into the expression for $U'_{CMB}$:\n$$U'_{CMB} = \\frac{4}{3} \\Gamma^2 a T_{CMB}^4$$\n\nNow we return to the equality of energy densities, $U'_B = U'_{CMB}$. Let $B'_{eq}$ be the magnetic field strength that satisfies this condition.\n$$\\frac{(B'_{eq})^2}{8\\pi} = \\frac{4}{3} \\Gamma^2 a T_{CMB}^4$$\n\nFinally, we solve for $B'_{eq}$:\n$$(B'_{eq})^2 = 8\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\Gamma^2 a T_{CMB}^4\\right)$$\n$$(B'_{eq})^2 = \\frac{32\\pi}{3} \\Gamma^2 a T_{CMB}^4$$\n$$B'_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32\\pi a}{3} \\Gamma^2 T_{CMB}^4}$$\n$$B'_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{32\\pi a}{3}} \\Gamma T_{CMB}^2$$\n\nThis is the final expression for the equipartition magnetic field strength in the comoving frame.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{32\\pi a}{3}} \\Gamma T_{CMB}^2}\n$$", "id": "339048"}, {"introduction": "One of the most counterintuitive phenomena in astrophysics is the observation of \"superluminal\" motion, where components in AGN jets appear to move across the sky faster than the speed of light.
