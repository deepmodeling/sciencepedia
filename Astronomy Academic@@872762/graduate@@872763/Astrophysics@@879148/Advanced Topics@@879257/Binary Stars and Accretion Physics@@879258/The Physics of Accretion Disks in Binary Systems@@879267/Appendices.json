The disk's thermal balance is primarily governed by heating from an external source (the central star) and cooling through local radiation. We want to investigate its thermal stability at a given radius.\n\nThe key assumptions for our model are:\n1.  **Heating:** The dominant heating mechanism is irradiation by the central star. Due to the flared geometry of the disk, the intercepted flux and thus the heating rate per unit area, $Q^+_{\\rm irr}$, is directly proportional to the disk's vertical pressure scale height, $H$. We can write this as $Q^+_{\\rm irr} = C_1 H$, where $C_1$ is a constant.\n2.  **Cooling:** The disk cools by radiating energy from its surfaces. In an optically thick medium, the vertical energy transport is dominated by radiative diffusion. The resulting cooling flux per unit area from the disk is given by $Q^-_{\\rm rad} = C_2 \\frac{T^4}{\\kappa \\Sigma}$, where $T$ is the midplane temperature, $\\kappa$ is the Rosseland mean opacity, $\\Sigma$ is the surface mass density, and $C_2$ is a constant. For the purpose of analyzing rapid thermal perturbations, assume $\\Sigma$ remains constant.\n3.  **State Dependencies:** Both the scale height $H$ and the opacity $\\kappa$ are functions of the local midplane temperature $T$.
