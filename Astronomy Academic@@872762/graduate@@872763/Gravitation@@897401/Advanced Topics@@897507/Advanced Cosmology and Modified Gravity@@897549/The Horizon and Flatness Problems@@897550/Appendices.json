The curvature density parameter $\\Omega_k$ is defined as $\\Omega_k = -k c^2 / (aH)^2$ (with $k=0, \\pm 1$ being the curvature index), so a large increase in $(aH)^2$ drives $\\Omega_k$ towards zero.\n\nConsider a model of power-law inflation, where the scale factor evolves as a function of time $t$ according to $a(t) \\propto t^p$ for some constant $p > 1$.
