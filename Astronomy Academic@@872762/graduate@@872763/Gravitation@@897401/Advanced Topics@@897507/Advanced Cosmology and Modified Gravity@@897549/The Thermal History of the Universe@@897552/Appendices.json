The frequent Compton scattering between photons and electrons provides a mechanism for momentum exchange, which gives the fluid properties like viscosity. This shear viscosity plays a crucial role in damping small-scale primordial density perturbations.\n\nThe viscosity of the photon fluid can be calculated by analyzing the anisotropic stress that arises in response to a shear flow. This is achieved by solving the collisional Boltzmann equation for the photon distribution function. This problem guides you through the final steps of this calculation.\n\n**Given Information:**\n\n1.  The photon fluid has an energy density $\\rho_\\gamma$ and pressure $P_\\gamma = \\rho_\\gamma/3$. The mean free time for a photon between Compton scatterings is denoted by $\\tau_c$.\n\n2.  Consider a small-amplitude, scalar plane-wave perturbation in the fluid, characterized by a wavevector $\\vec{k}$. The perturbation in the photon distribution function can be expanded in multipole moments, $\\Theta_\\ell$. The $\\ell=1$ moment (dipole) is related to the photon fluid's bulk velocity $v_\\gamma$ by $\\Theta_1 = v_\\gamma$.\n\n3.  In the tight-coupling ($\\tau_c$ is short compared to the wave period) and quasi-static limit, the shear in the velocity field (represented by $k\\Theta_1$) sources a quadrupole moment ($\\Theta_2$) in the photon distribution. This relationship is given by:\n    $$ \\Theta_2 = C_1 k \\tau_c \\Theta_1 $$\n    where $C_1 = 4/9$ is a dimensionless constant derived from the Boltzmann equation.\n\n4.  This non-zero quadrupole moment corresponds to an anisotropic stress in the photon fluid.
