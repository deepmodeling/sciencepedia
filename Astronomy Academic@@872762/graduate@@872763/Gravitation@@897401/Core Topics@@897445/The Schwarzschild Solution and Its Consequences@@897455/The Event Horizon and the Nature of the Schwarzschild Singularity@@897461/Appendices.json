The diagram is divided into four distinct regions: Region I represents an asymptotically flat universe (like our own), Region II is the black hole interior, Region III is a second identical asymptotically flat universe, and Region IV is the white hole interior. These regions are bounded by event horizons (which are null hypersurfaces), singularities at radial coordinate $r=0$ (which are spacelike hypersurfaces), and various infinities. The key infinities are past timelike infinity ($i^{-}$), the origin of all timelike worldlines; future timelike infinity ($i^{+}$), a possible destination for timelike worldlines; past null infinity ($\\mathcal{I}^{-}$), the origin of incoming light rays; and future null infinity ($\\mathcal{I}^{+}$), the destination of outgoing light rays that escape to infinity.\n\nAn astronaut embarks on a one-way mission from our universe (Region I) into the Schwarzschild black hole.

Consequently, $r$ becomes a timelike coordinate in Region II.

Timelike worldlines that extend to infinity originate at $i^{-}$ and may end at $i^{+}$; they do not begin at $\\mathcal{I}^{-}$ nor end at $\\mathcal{I}^{+}$.\n- The Einstein-Rosen bridge between Regions I and III is spacelike; no future-directed causal curve from Region I can traverse to Region III. Region IV (white hole interior) lies to the past; a future-directed timelike curve from Region I cannot enter Region IV, nor can a curve in Region II cross into Region IV in the future direction.\n\nNow evaluate each option:\n- A: A future-directed timelike worldline from Region I cannot enter Region III; the I–III bridge is spacelike and non-traversable by causal curves. Ending at $i^{+}$ of Region III is therefore impossible. Hence A is not allowed.\n- B: After crossing $\\mathcal{H}^{+}$ into Region II, the worldline must proceed to $r=0$ in its causal future. Region IV is to the past and cannot be reached by a future-directed timelike curve from Region II.

Hence D is allowed.\n- E: Exiting back to Region I after crossing the future event horizon would require reversing the time orientation and violating the one-way nature of $\\mathcal{H}^{+}$.
