The primary laboratory is located in a valley at sea level, while the second laboratory is situated on a mountain plateau at a vertical elevation of $h = 1054$ m directly above the first. A highly stable laser at the valley laboratory emits a continuous beam of light with a constant frequency $f_0$, which is transmitted through the optical fiber to the mountain laboratory.\n\nDue to the difference in gravitational potential between the two locations, the frequency of the light measured at the mountain laboratory, $f_m$, will be different from the frequency $f_0$ emitted by the source.

The experiment takes place inside a small, spherical, empty cavity of radius $r_c$ carved out at the exact center of a large, non-rotating, spherical planet. The planet has a uniform mass density $\\rho$ and a total radius $R$, where $R \\gg r_c$.\n\nWithin this central cavity, a gamma-ray source is fixed at a position $\\vec{r}_S$ and a corresponding resonant absorber, acting as a detector, is fixed at a position $\\vec{r}_D$. The source emits gamma rays of a precise frequency $f_S$. The line connecting the source and detector is oriented radially from the planet's center, and the distance between them is $h = |\\vec{r}_D - \\vec{r}_S|$, which is much smaller than the cavity radius ($h \\ll r_c$).

The shift is $z = -gh/c^2$, where $g = G M / R^2$ is the gravitational acceleration at the planet's surface. This redshift occurs because the detector is at a higher gravitational potential.\n\nB. The shift is $z = +gh/c^2$, where $g = G M / R^2$ is the gravitational acceleration at the planet's surface. This blueshift occurs because the detector is effectively \"higher\" in the gravitational field.\n\nC. The shift is $z = 0$, because the net gravitational force at the geometric center of the planet is zero, and the experiment is performed in a small region around this point.\n\nD. The shift is $z = 0$, because Newton's shell theorem implies that the gravitational potential is constant everywhere inside the empty central cavity, meaning there is no difference in the rate of flow of time between the source and the detector.\n\nE. The shift is $z > 0$ and proportional to $\\rho h^2 / c^2$. This blueshift is caused by the non-zero tidal forces that exist within the cavity, which create a non-uniform spacetime.", "solution": "For a stationary emitter (S) and detector (D) in a static gravitational field, General Relativity gives the frequency shift as\n$$\\frac{f_{D}}{f_{S}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{g_{00}(S)}{g_{00}(D)}}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad z=\\frac{f_{D}-f_{S}}{f_{S}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{g_{00}(S)}{g_{00}(D)}}-1.$$\nIn the weak-field limit, with $g_{00} \\approx -(1 + 2\\Phi/c^2)$, this yields\n$$z \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_S - \\Phi_D}{c^2}.$$\n\nInside the cavity $r < r_c$ there is vacuum and perfect spherical symmetry. By Birkhoff’s theorem, the unique spherically symmetric vacuum solution is the Schwarzschild solution with a mass parameter equal to the mass enclosed.

The mass distribution of the planet from $r_c$ to $R$ is a superposition of such shells, so the total potential is constant everywhere inside the empty central cavity. A direct calculation gives the potential for any point inside the cavity as\n$$\\Phi(\\text{inside cavity})=\\int_{r_{c}}^{R}\\left(-G\\,\\frac{dM(a)}{a}\\right)=-G\\int_{r_{c}}^{R}\\frac{4\\pi\\rho a^{2}}{a}\\,da=-4\\pi G\\rho\\int_{r_{c}}^{R}a\\,da=-2\\pi G\\rho\\left(R^{2}-r_{c}^{2}\\right),$$\nwhich is a constant.

Option D provides the correct reasoning: the potential is constant, so there is no difference in the rate of time flow. Option C is incorrect because zero force at a single point does not imply a constant potential over a region. Options A and B are incorrect because the potential difference is zero. Option E is incorrect because the spacetime inside the cavity is flat (no tidal forces).
