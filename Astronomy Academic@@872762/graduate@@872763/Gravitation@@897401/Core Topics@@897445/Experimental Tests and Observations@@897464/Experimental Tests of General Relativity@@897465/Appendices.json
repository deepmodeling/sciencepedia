By calculating this correction, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how classical perturbations affect relativistic measurements in practical astronomical scenarios.", "problem": "**Title:** Gravitational Redshift Correction from a Planetary Quadrupole Moment\n\n**Background:**\nIn the weak-field limit of General Relativity, the gravitational redshift $z$ of a light signal traveling between two points A (emitter) and B (receiver) in a static gravitational field is given by $z \\approx (\\Phi_B - \\Phi_A)/c^2$, where $\\Phi$ is the Newtonian gravitational potential and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor a massive, rotating planet, the mass distribution is not perfectly spherical, leading to a non-spherically symmetric gravitational potential. For an axially symmetric planet, the external gravitational potential can be described by a multipole expansion. Up to the quadrupole term, this potential is given by:\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta) = -\\frac{GM}{r} \\left[ 1 - J_2 \\left(\\frac{R}{r}\\right)^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the planet's mass, $R$ is its equatorial radius, and $r$ is the radial distance from the planet's center. The parameter $J_2$ is the dimensionless zonal harmonic coefficient representing the planet's oblateness. The angle $\\theta$ is the colatitude, measured from the axis of symmetry ($\\theta=0$ at the north pole, $\\theta=\\pi/2$ at the equator). The function $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)$ is the second Legendre polynomial.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider a tower of height $h$ built on the surface of this planet at a constant colatitude $\\theta_0$. We assume $h \\ll R$. A light signal is emitted from the base of the tower (at radius $R$) and received at the top (at radius $R+h$).\n\nLet $z_0$ be the gravitational redshift that would be measured if the planet were a perfect sphere (i.e., if $J_2=0$). Let $z_{J_2}$ be the actual redshift measured on the oblate planet.\n\nCalculate the fractional correction to the redshift, $\\delta_z = \\frac{z_{J_2} - z_0}{z_0}$, caused by the planet's quadrupole moment. Your final answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $J_2$ and $\\theta_0$.", "solution": "**1. Define the Gravitational Redshift Formula**\nIn the weak-field, static limit, the gravitational redshift $z$ is given by the difference in gravitational potential between the receiver (B) and emitter (A):\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\Phi_B - \\Phi_A}{c^2}\n$$\n\n**2.

Evaluate the Derivative at the Planet's Surface**\nWe evaluate this derivative at the base of the tower, where $r=R$ and $\\theta=\\theta_0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=R, \\theta=\\theta_0} = \\frac{GM}{R^2} - \\frac{3GM J_2 R^2}{R^4} P_2(\\cos\\theta_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=R, \\theta=\\theta_0} = \\frac{GM}{R^2} \\left[ 1 - 3 J_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta_0) \\right]\n$$\n\n**6. Determine the Redshift with the Quadrupole Moment ($z_{J_2}$)**\nSubstituting the derivative back into the expression for $\\Delta\\Phi$, we find the total redshift $z_{J_2}$:\n$$\nz_{J_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{c^2} = \\frac{h}{c^2} \\left( \\frac{GM}{R^2} \\left[ 1 - 3 J_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta_0) \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nz_{J_2} = \\frac{GMh}{R^2c^2} \\left[ 1 - 3 J_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta_0) \\right]\n$$\n\n**7.
