Alex remains on Earth for the entire duration of the experiment. On their 25th birthday, Ben and Chloe immediately depart on separate starships.

Both starships travel at a constant speed $v = 0.8c$ relative to Earth, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.

A pole can seem to fit inside a shorter barn from one perspective, but not from another, leading to an apparent contradiction.

That is, $L_T = L_0/\\gamma$, where $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor. Observers in the lab frame S place detectors at the tunnel's entrance (D1) and exit (D2). They observe that the train exactly fits within the tunnel at a particular instant in their frame. This means the following two events are simultaneous in the lab frame S:\n\n*   **Event A:** The front of the train passes the detector at the tunnel exit, D2.\n*   **Event B:** The rear of the train passes the detector at the tunnel entrance, D1.\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on the train (the train's rest frame, S'), the train has its proper length $L_0$, while the tunnel is moving and its length is contracted to $L_T' = L_T/\\gamma = L_0/\\gamma^2$.
