This first practice provides a direct and quantitative test of this idea using a familiar mechanical system. By analyzing the change in a spring's extension inside an accelerating elevator, we can see precisely how a fictitious inertial force effectively modifies the local 'gravity' experienced by an object [@problem_id:1832102].", "problem": "A small block of mass $m$ is attached to a massless ideal spring with a spring constant $k$. The other end of the spring is fixed to the ceiling of an elevator. Initially, the elevator is stationary, and the block hangs in equilibrium, causing the spring to be stretched by a distance $x_0$ from its natural, un-stretched length.\n\nThe elevator then begins to move downwards with a constant acceleration of magnitude $a$, where $0 < a < g$ and $g$ is the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration. After any transient oscillations have ceased, the block reaches a new equilibrium position relative to the elevator, with the spring now stretched by a distance $x_1$.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the new equilibrium spring extension to the original equilibrium extension, $\\frac{x_1}{x_0}$. Your answer should be a dimensionless expression in terms of $a$ and $g$.", "solution": "Let downward be positive. When the elevator is stationary, the block is in static equilibrium under gravity and the spring force. The upward spring force has magnitude $k x_{0}$ and the downward weight has magnitude $m g$.

In this frame, in addition to real forces (spring upward $k x_{1}$ and weight downward $m g$), there is a fictitious force of magnitude $m a$ acting upward (opposite the frame’s downward acceleration). At equilibrium in this frame, the net force is zero:\n$$\nk x_{1} + m a - m g = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k x_{1} = m (g - a) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x_{1} = \\frac{m (g - a)}{k}.\n$$\n\nTaking the ratio of the new to the original extension,\n$$\n\\frac{x_{1}}{x_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{m (g - a)}{k}}{\\frac{m g}{k}} = \\frac{g - a}{g} = 1 - \\frac{a}{g}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{a}{g}}$$", "id": "1832102"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how acceleration can simulate gravity, we now explore the converse: how a state of free fall can effectively eliminate it. In a freely falling reference frame—a true local inertial frame—all objects accelerate together, nullifying the relative effects of gravity such as weight and buoyancy. This conceptual exercise involving a sand and water mixture challenges you to predict the outcome in a 'weightless' environment, reinforcing the core concept of what it means to be in an inertial frame in the presence of gravity [@problem_id:1832059].", "problem": "An astronaut is conducting a simple fluid dynamics experiment aboard an aircraft that flies in a parabolic trajectory to simulate a weightless environment. The experiment uses a sealed, transparent, rigid container partially filled with a mixture of fine sand and water. The density of the sand particles is significantly greater than the density of the water. At the precise moment the aircraft enters the free-fall portion of its parabolic arc, the astronaut shakes the container vigorously to ensure the sand is uniformly dispersed throughout the water. The astronaut then holds the container perfectly still relative to the cabin for the entire duration of the weightless period.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the state of the sand-water mixture as observed by the astronaut at the end of the free-fall period?\n\nA. The sand remains suspended and approximately uniformly distributed throughout the water.\nB. The sand sediments and forms a layer on the side of the container that is oriented towards the Earth's surface.\nC. The sand and water separate, with the sand particles coalescing into a single, dense, spherical cluster near the geometric center of the water volume.\nD. The sand sediments and forms a layer on the side of the container that is oriented away from the Earth's surface, i.e., towards the \"ceiling\" of the aircraft cabin.", "solution": "The aircraft follows a parabolic trajectory such that, during the free-fall segment, the aircraft, container, fluid, and particles share the same acceleration as a freely falling frame. In the container’s comoving frame, the effective gravitational acceleration is\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{g}_{\\text{eff}}=\\boldsymbol{g}-\\boldsymbol{a}_{\\text{aircraft}}\\approx \\boldsymbol{0}.\n$$\nHydrostatics then gives a uniform pressure field, since\n$$\n\\nabla p=\\rho_{f}\\,\\boldsymbol{g}_{\\text{eff}}\\approx \\boldsymbol{0},\n$$\nso there is no buoyancy force on a particle:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}_{b}=\\rho_{f} V \\boldsymbol{g}_{\\text{eff}}\\approx \\boldsymbol{0}.\n$$\nLikewise, the particle’s weight relative to the fluid vanishes in this frame, so there is no net body force to drive sedimentation in any direction.

With $g_{\\text{eff}}=0$, one has $v_{s}=0$, so neither sedimentation toward the Earth-facing side nor toward the opposite side can occur. This rules out options B and D.\n\nRegarding option C, there is no external central force field that would concentrate particles at the geometric center. Mutual gravitational attraction between particles is negligible compared to both thermal agitation and viscous resistance. The gravitational potential energy for two grains of mass $m$ separated by a distance on the order of their size $a$ is\n$$\nU_{g}\\sim \\frac{G m^{2}}{a},\n$$\nwhich satisfies $U_{g}\\ll k_{B}T$ for typical grain sizes and temperatures, preventing gravitational collapse. Any drift speed set by mutual gravity and balanced by Stokes drag would be\n$$\nv\\sim \\frac{F_{g}}{6\\pi \\mu a}\\sim \\frac{G m^{2}}{6\\pi \\mu a^{3}},\n$$\nwhich is negligibly small over the finite duration of microgravity. Thus, no spherical coalescence at the center occurs.\n\nIn the absence of net body forces and macroscopic flows (the astronaut holds the container still), the suspension’s evolution is dominated by Brownian diffusion, with mean-square displacement $\\langle x^{2}\\rangle \\sim 2 D t$ and\n$$\nD=\\frac{k_{B}T}{6\\pi \\mu a}.\n$$\nFor sand-sized particles, $a$ is large enough that $D$ is very small, so over the short free-fall interval the initially well-mixed state remains approximately uniform. Surface tension can shape the free surface of the water within the container, but it does not impose a bulk force that would gather the particles at the center of the volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the sand remains suspended and approximately uniformly distributed throughout the water by the end of the free-fall period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1832059"}, {"introduction": "The equivalence of gravity and acceleration is a powerful local principle, but it has its limits. A true gravitational field, unlike the fictitious force in a uniformly accelerating frame, is not perfectly uniform—it possesses a spatial gradient.
