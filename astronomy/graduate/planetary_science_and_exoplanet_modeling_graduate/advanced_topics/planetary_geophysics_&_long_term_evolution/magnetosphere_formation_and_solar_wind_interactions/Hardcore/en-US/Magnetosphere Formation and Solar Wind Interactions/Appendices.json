This distance is established at the boundary where the outward magnetic pressure of the planet's magnetosphere balances the inward dynamic pressure of the stellar wind.\n\nFirst, we establish the principle of pressure balance at the subsolar point of the magnetopause:\n$$P_{dyn} = P_{B}$$\nwhere $P_{dyn}$ is the dynamic pressure of the stellar wind and $P_{B}$ is the magnetic pressure just inside the magnetopause.\n\nThe dynamic pressure of the stellar wind is given by the formula $P_{dyn} = \\rho V^2$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density of the wind and $V$ is its bulk speed. The problem states that the wind is a hydrogen plasma, so the mass density can be expressed as $\\rho = n m_p$, where $n$ is the proton number density and $m_p$ is the mass of a proton.\nTherefore, the dynamic pressure is:\n$$P_{dyn} = n m_p V^2$$\n\nNext, we establish the magnetic pressure, $P_B$.

The problem specifies that the magnetic field just inside the magnetopause, $B$, is twice the planet's intrinsic dipole field at that location. This factor of $2$ accounts for the compression of the planetary magnetic field by magnetopause currents (the Chapman-Ferraro current system).\nThe magnetic field of a dipole on its equatorial plane at a distance $r$ from the center is given by:\n$$B_{dipole}(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 M}{4\\pi r^3}$$\nwhere $M$ is the magnetic dipole moment.

We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state resistive MHD induction equation and the incompressible continuity equation.\nThe induction equation in a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = 0$) is:\n$$\n0 = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}$ is the plasma velocity, $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $\\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity. The first term on the right-hand side represents the advection of magnetic flux by the plasma flow, and the second term represents the diffusion of the magnetic field.\n\nThe incompressible continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\n$$\n\nWe apply order-of-magnitude analysis to these equations for a two-dimensional current sheet of half-length $L$ and half-thickness $\\delta$. The plasma flows into the sheet along the short dimension (thickness $2\\delta$) with speed $v_{in}$ and is ejected from the ends of the sheet along the long dimension (length $2L$) with speed $v_{out}$. The upstream magnetic field magnitude is $B$, which reconnects within the layer.\n\nFrom the induction equation, we balance the advection and diffusion terms within the layer. The advection term, $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, scales as the inflow speed $v_{in}$ times the main field component $B$ over the characteristic gradient length, which is the layer half-thickness $\\delta$.\n$$\n|\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\frac{v_{in} B}{\\delta}\n$$\nThe diffusion term, $\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})$, involves two curl operators. The magnetic field changes from $+B$ to $-B$ across the thickness $2\\delta$, so $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} \\sim B/\\delta$. The second curl operates on this quantity over the same scale $\\delta$.\n$$\n|\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\frac{\\eta B}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nIn a steady state, these two effects must balance:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{in} B}{\\delta} \\sim \\frac{\\eta B}{\\delta^2} \\implies v_{in} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the continuity equation, which represents mass conservation. For an incompressible fluid with density $\\rho$, the mass flux into the layer must equal the mass flux out. Plasma flows in over an area of $2L \\times 1$ (for unit depth) from both sides, and flows out through an area of $2\\delta \\times 1$ at both ends. Considering a quadrant of the system, the inflow area is proportional to $L$ and the outflow area to $\\delta$.\n$$\n\\rho v_{in} L \\sim \\rho v_{out} \\delta \\implies v_{in} L \\sim v_{out} \\delta\n$$\nThe problem states that the outflow is Alfvénic, i.e., $v_{out}$ is equal to the upstream Alfvén speed $V_A$.

This significant discrepancy is the well-known \"fast reconnection problem\" in plasma physics. The Sweet-Parker model, being based on resistive MHD, is too slow to explain the rapid energy release observed in systems like Earth's magnetosphere and solar flares. This suggests that other, non-resistive physical processes (e.g., Hall effect, kinetic instabilities) operating in collisionless plasmas are crucial for achieving the observed fast reconnection rates.",
