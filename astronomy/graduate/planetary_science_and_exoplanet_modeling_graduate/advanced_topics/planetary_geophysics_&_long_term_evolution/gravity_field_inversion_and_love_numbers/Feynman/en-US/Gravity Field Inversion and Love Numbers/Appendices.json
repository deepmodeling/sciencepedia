            "solution": "The problem asks for two distinct derivations of the leading-order expression for the second-degree zonal harmonic coefficient, $J_2$, of a homogeneous Maclaurin spheroid with small eccentricity $e$. The first derivation is based on the spheroid's geometry and mass distribution (moments of inertia). The second is based on the theory of hydrostatic equilibrium using the fluid Love number $k_2$. Finally, the ratio of the two results is required.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $J_2$ from Moments of Inertia**\n\nThe external gravitational potential, $V$, of an axisymmetric body can be expressed as a multipole expansion in spherical harmonics. To second degree, it is given by:\n$$\nV(r, \\theta) = -\\frac{GM}{r} \\left( 1 - J_2 \\left(\\frac{a}{r}\\right)^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) + \\dots \\right)\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $a$ is the equatorial radius, $r$ is the radial distance, $\\theta$ is the colatitude, and $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)$ is the second-degree Legendre polynomial. The dimensionless coefficient $J_2$ is related to the principal moments of inertia of the body. For a body with rotational symmetry about the z-axis, this relation is:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{C - A}{Ma^2}\n$$\nHere, $C$ is the moment of inertia about the polar axis (z-axis), and $A$ is the moment of inertia about any equatorial axis (e.g., the x-axis).\n\nFor a homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution (a spheroid) with uniform density $\\rho$, equatorial semi-axis $a$, and polar semi-axis $c$, the principal moments of inertia are given by:\n$$\nC = \\frac{2}{5} M a^2\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{5} M (a^2 + c^2)\n$$\nThe difference between the principal moments of inertia is:\n$$\nC - A = \\frac{2}{5} M a^2 - \\frac{1}{5} M (a^2 + c^2) = \\frac{1}{5} M (2a^2 - a^2 - c^2) = \\frac{1}{5} M (a^2 - c^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_2$:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} M (a^2 - c^2)}{M a^2} = \\frac{1}{5} \\frac{a^2 - c^2}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left(1 - \\frac{c^2}{a^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the eccentricity $e$ such that $e^2 = 1 - c^2/a^2$. Therefore, the expression for $J_2$ for a homogeneous Maclaurin spheroid is:\n$$\nJ_{2,\\text{Maclaurin}} = \\frac{1}{5} e^2\n$$\nThis expression is exact and thus also represents the leading non-trivial order in the small parameter $e$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of $J_2$ using the Fluid Love Number Framework**\n\nThe Love number framework describes a body's response to a deforming potential. For a body rotating with angular velocity $\\omega$, the centrifugal potential $V_c$ acts as a deforming potential.\n$$\nV_c = -\\frac{1}{2} \\omega^2 r^2 \\sin^2\\theta = -\\frac{1}{3} \\omega^2 r^2 (1 - P_2(\\cos\\theta)) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 r^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 r^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThe $P_2$ component of this potential, $\\Phi_2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\omega^2 r^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)$, causes the degree-$2$ deformation. The body's response to this potential generates an additional gravitational potential, $\\Delta V_2$. The potential Love number $k_2$ is defined by the relation $\\Delta V_2 = k_2 \\Phi_2$ evaluated at the body's surface.\n\nFrom the multipole expansion, the additional potential due to the $J_2$ term is $\\Delta V_2 = \\frac{GMa^2}{r^3} J_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)$. At the surface ($r=a$), we have:\n$$\n\\Delta V_2(a) = \\frac{GM}{a} J_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThe deforming potential at the surface is:\n$$\n\\Phi_2(a) = \\frac{1}{3} \\omega^2 a^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nApplying the definition of $k_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{GM}{a} J_2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) = k_2 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\omega^2 a^2 P_2(\\cos\\theta) \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $J_2$:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{k_2 \\omega^2 a^3}{3GM}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the dimensionless rotation parameter $q = \\omega^2 a^3 / (GM)$, we get:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{3} k_2 q\n$$\nFor a homogeneous, incompressible fluid body in hydrostatic equilibrium, the theoretical value of the degree-$2$ potential Love number is $k_2 = 3/2$. Substituting this value:\n$$\nJ_{2,\\text{Love}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) q = \\frac{1}{2} q\n$$\nTo express $J_2$ in terms of $e$, we need the relationship between $q$ and $e$ for a Maclaurin spheroid in hydrostatic equilibrium, valid for small $e$. The exact equilibrium condition is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{2\\pi G \\rho} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{e^3} (3-2e^2) \\arcsin(e) - \\frac{3(1-e^2)}{e^2}\n$$\nWe expand this for small $e$, using $\\arcsin(e) = e + e^3/6 + 3e^5/40 + O(e^7)$ and $\\sqrt{1-e^2} = 1 - e^2/2 - e^4/8 + O(e^6)$. The expansion to the first non-vanishing term yields:\n$\\frac{\\omega^2}{2\\pi G \\rho} = \\left(\\frac{3}{e^2} - 3 + \\frac{4}{15}e^2 + O(e^4)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{e^2} - 3\\right) = \\frac{4}{15}e^2 + O(e^4)$.\nSo, to leading order:\n$$\n\\omega^2 \\approx \\frac{8\\pi G \\rho}{15} e^2\n$$\nNow we express $q$ in terms of $\\omega^2$. The mass is $M = \\rho V = \\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^2 c = \\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{1-e^2}$. For small $e$, $M \\approx \\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$.\n$$\nq = \\frac{\\omega^2 a^3}{GM} \\approx \\frac{\\omega^2 a^3}{G(\\rho \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3)} = \\frac{3\\omega^2}{4\\pi G \\rho}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\omega^2$:\n$$\nq \\approx \\frac{3}{4\\pi G \\rho} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi G \\rho}{15} e^2 \\right) = \\frac{24}{60} e^2 = \\frac{2}{5} e^2\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this relation for $q$ into our expression for $J_{2,\\text{Love}}$:\n$$\nJ_{2,\\text{Love}} = \\frac{1}{2} q \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{5} e^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{5} e^2\n$$\nThis is the leading-order prediction from the fluid Love number framework.\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of the Two Results**\n\nThe first method yielded $J_{2,\\text{Maclaurin}} = \\frac{1}{5}e^2$. The second method yielded the same leading-order result, $J_{2,\\text{Love}} \\approx \\frac{1}{5}e^2$. The ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{J_{2,\\text{Maclaurin}}}{J_{2,\\text{Love}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5}e^2}{\\frac{1}{5}e^2} = 1\n$$\nThe identity of the two results is expected, as they are two different but consistent formalisms for describing the same physical object: a homogeneous fluid body in hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the leading-order expression for $J_2(e)$ and the ratio.\n$J_2(e) = \\frac{1}{5}e^2$.\nRatio = $1$.",

No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The derivation of the degree-2 potential Love number, $k_2$, for a homogeneous, incompressible, self-gravitating elastic sphere proceeds by solving the equations for static equilibrium for the body under the specified tidal forcing.\n\n**Governing Equations**\nThe response of the sphere is governed by three main physical principles:\n1.  **Static Momentum Balance (Navier's Equation)**: For a body in static equilibrium, the sum of all forces (pressure gradients, elastic stresses, and gravitational body forces) is zero. Linearizing about an initial hydrostatic state $(\\rho, p_0, \\Phi_0)$, the equation is:\n    $$-\\nabla p_1 + \\rho \\nabla \\Phi_1 + \\mathbf{f}_{el} = 0$$\n    where $p_1$ is the pressure perturbation, $\\Phi_1 = \\Phi' + U$ is the sum of the induced and external tidal potentials, and $\\mathbf{f}_{el} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the force from elastic stresses $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. For an isotropic, linear elastic solid with shear modulus $\\mu$, this term is $\\mathbf{f}_{el} = \\mu (\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\frac{1}{3} \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}))$.\n2.  **Incompressibility**: The material is incompressible, so the divergence of the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ is zero:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$$\n3.  **Poisson's Equation**: The induced potential $\\Phi'$ is generated by the redistribution of mass. For an incompressible body, this redistribution occurs only at the surface. Thus, inside the sphere, the density perturbation is zero, and $\\Phi'$ satisfies Laplace's equation:\n    $$\\nabla^2 \\Phi' = 0$$\n\n**Spherical Harmonic Expansion**\nThe forcing potential has a degree-2 spherical harmonic geometry, so the response of the spherical body will have the same symmetry. We expand the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}$ and the potential perturbation $\\Phi'$ in terms of degree-2 spherical harmonics:\n-   Displacement: $\\mathbf{u}(r,\\theta,\\phi) = H(r) Y_{2m}(\\theta,\\phi) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r T(r) \\nabla_1 Y_{2m}(\\theta,\\phi)$\n-   Induced Potential: $\\Phi'(r,\\theta,\\phi) = P(r) Y_{2m}(\\theta,\\phi)$\nHere, $H(r)$ and $T(r)$ are the radial functions for radial and tangential displacement, respectively, and $P(r)$ is the radial function for the induced potential. $\\nabla_1$ is the angular part of the gradient operator.\n\n**General Solutions for the Radial Functions**\nSubstituting these forms into the governing equations yields a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the radial functions $H(r)$, $T(r)$, and $P(r)$. The general solutions regular at the origin ($r=0$) for a homogeneous sphere are known to be polynomials:\n-   From $\\nabla^2 \\Phi' = 0$: $P(r) = C_P r^2$.\n-   From the momentum equation and incompressibility:\n    $$H(r) = C_H r + D_H r^3$$\n    $$T(r) = \\frac{1}{2}C_H + \\frac{5}{6}D_H r^2$$\nThe constants $C_P$, $C_H$, and $D_H$ must be determined by the boundary conditions at the free surface $r=R$.\n\n**Boundary Conditions at the Free Surface ($r=R$)**\n1.  **Gravitational Boundary Condition**: The induced potential $\\Phi'$ must be continuous across the surface, and its radial gradient must have a discontinuity related to the surface mass density anomaly $\\sigma_s = \\rho H(R)$. This leads to the well-known relation for a homogeneous body:\n    $$P(R) = \\frac{3}{5} g H(R)$$\n2.  **Vanishing Shear Traction**: The surface is free, meaning no external forces are applied to it. Thus, the shear stress components of the traction vector must vanish at $r=R$. For a degree-2 deformation, this simplifies to one condition:\n    $$\\tau_{r\\theta}(R) = \\mu \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} + \\frac{H}{r} \\right)\\Big|_{r=R} = 0$$\n3.  **Vanishing Normal Traction**: The radial component of the traction vector must also vanish at $r=R$. This involves the radial elastic stress, the pressure perturbation, and the effect of displacing the surface in the initial gravity field. The condition is:\n    $$\\sigma_{rr}(R) = 0$$\n\n**Solving for the Coefficients and Deriving $k_2$**\nA full derivation is algebraically intensive. It involves substituting the polynomial solutions into the boundary condition equations to determine the unknown coefficients. The key intermediate result obtained from applying the stress boundary conditions is an expression for the radial surface displacement $H(R)$ as a function of the tidal potential strength $U(R)$:\n    $$H(R) = \\frac{5 U(R)}{2g + \\frac{19\\mu}{\\rho R}}$$\nThis expression encapsulates the balance between the tidal driving force and the restoring forces of elasticity and self-gravity.\n\nWe can now find $k_2$ using its definition, $k_2 = \\Phi'(R)/U(R)$, and the gravitational boundary condition, $P(R) = \\frac{3}{5} g H(R)$. The ratio of the full potentials is the ratio of their radial parts.\n$$k_2 = \\frac{P(R)}{U(R)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{5} g H(R)}{U(R)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H(R)$:\n$$k_2 = \\frac{3g}{5U(R)} \\left( \\frac{5 U(R)}{2g + \\frac{19\\mu}{\\rho R}} \\right) = \\frac{3g}{2g + \\frac{19\\mu}{\\rho R}}$$\nTo arrive at the conventional dimensionless form, we divide the numerator and denominator by $2g$:\n$$k_2 = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 + \\frac{19\\mu}{2g\\rho R}}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the degree-2 potential Love number for a homogeneous, incompressible, elastic sphere.\n\n**Fluid Limit and Physical Interpretation**\nThe problem asks to consider the limit as the shear modulus $\\mu \\to 0$. This corresponds to a body with no shear strength, i.e., a fluid. Taking the limit of our derived expression for $k_2$:\n$$\\lim_{\\mu \\to 0} k_2 = \\lim_{\\mu \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 + \\frac{19\\mu}{2g\\rho R}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 + 0} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThe fluid-limit value is $k_2 = 3/2$.\n\nThe shear modulus $\\mu$ represents the material's resistance to shear deformation. As $\\mu \\to 0$, this resistance vanishes. The body can no longer support shear stresses, and it deforms more readily under the tidal force. The tidal bulge becomes larger, which in turn generates a larger gravitational potential perturbation $\\Phi'$. Consequently, the ratio $k_2 = \\Phi'(R)/U(R)$ increases. The value $k_2 = 3/2$ is the maximum possible potential Love number for a homogeneous self-gravitating body, representing the case where only self-gravity and pressure forces counteract the tidal deformation. The presence of elasticity ($\\mu > 0$) adds an elastic restoring force that stiffens the body, reduces the deformation, and therefore lowers the value of $k_2$ below the fluid limit of $3/2$.",

This system can be solved for $C_2$ and $C_3$. After significant algebraic manipulation, the solution for $k_2$ is found to be:\n$$\nk_2 = \\frac{3\\rho_m(2\\rho_c + 3\\rho_m) + \\left[9\\rho_m + 15\\left(\\rho_c\\alpha^3 + \\rho_m(1-\\alpha^3)\\right)\\right](\\rho_c - \\rho_m)\\alpha^5}{(2\\rho_c+3\\rho_m)\\left[2\\rho_m + 5(\\rho_c-\\rho_m)\\alpha^3\\right] - 9\\rho_m(\\rho_c-\\rho_m)\\alpha^5}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = r_c/R$. This expression depends only on the densities and the core radius ratio, as required. As a check, if $\\rho_c=\\rho_m$, all terms with $(\\rho_c-\\rho_m)$ vanish. The numerator becomes $3\\rho_m(5\\rho_m) = 15\\rho_m^2$, and the denominator becomes $(5\\rho_m)(2\\rho_m)=10\\rho_m^2$. Then $k_2 = 15/10 = 3/2$, which is the correct value for a uniform fluid body.",
