            "introduction": "A fundamental question in planetary magnetism is why some planets possess long-lived magnetic fields. This exercise explores the \"other side\" of that question: how quickly would a field decay if left to its own devices? By performing a dimensional analysis of the magnetic induction equation, you will calculate the magnetic diffusion timescale, which reveals the natural lifetime of a magnetic field in a conductive core without a sustaining mechanism. This calculation for Mercury provides a concrete estimate that underscores the absolute necessity of an active dynamo to explain observed planetary magnetic fields .",

            "problem": "A conducting fluid in a planetary core evolves its magnetic field according to the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) induction equation, which contains an advective term and a resistive (diffusive) term characterized by the magnetic diffusivity. Consider Mercury’s fluid outer core as a spherical shell of thickness $L$ in which large-scale magnetic field gradients are of order $L^{-1}$. Starting from the magnetic induction equation and using dimensional analysis, derive the characteristic timescale for purely resistive evolution of the magnetic field in the shell. Then compute this timescale for Mercury using the following physically plausible parameters: electrical conductivity $\\sigma = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}$ S m$^{-1}$, magnetic permeability of free space $\\mu_{0} = 4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ H m$^{-1}$, and shell thickness $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ m. For context, decadal-scale secular variation corresponds to a timescale of order $10$ years, but your final output should be the diffusion timescale only. Use $1$ year $= 3.154 \\times 10^{7}$ s and $1$ kyr $= 10^{3}$ years. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express it in kiloyears (kyr).",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe evolution of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ in a moving, conducting fluid is described by the MHD induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the fluid velocity, $t$ is time, and $\\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity. The first term on the right-hand side, $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, represents the advection and stretching of magnetic field lines by the fluid flow (the dynamo effect). The second term, $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$, represents the dissipation of the magnetic field due to finite electrical resistance (the resistive or diffusive term).\n\nThe magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space and $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity of the fluid.\n\nThe problem asks for the characteristic timescale of *purely resistive evolution*. This corresponds to a scenario where the fluid is static, i.e., $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$. In this case, the advection term vanishes, and the induction equation simplifies to the magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nTo find the characteristic timescale, we perform a dimensional analysis of this equation. Let $\\tau_d$ be the characteristic timescale for the magnetic field to change significantly, $L$ be the characteristic length scale over which the magnetic field varies, and $B$ be a characteristic magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nWe can approximate the partial derivatives with ratios of these characteristic quantities. The time derivative on the left-hand side (LHS) has a scale of:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} \\right| \\sim \\frac{B}{\\tau_d}\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$, involves second spatial derivatives. Since the problem states that magnetic field gradients are of order $L^{-1}$, we can infer that the Laplacian scales as $L^{-2}$. Thus, the diffusive term on the right-hand side (RHS) has a scale of:\n$$\n|\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}| \\sim \\eta \\frac{B}{L^2}\n$$\nFor the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the scales of the LHS and RHS must be of the same order of magnitude:\n$$\n\\frac{B}{\\tau_d} \\sim \\eta \\frac{B}{L^2}\n$$\nSolving for the timescale $\\tau_d$, we find:\n$$\n\\tau_d \\sim \\frac{L^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic magnetic diffusion (or resistive) timescale.

Discretization**\nWe define a uniform radial grid with $N$ points over the nondimensional radius $\\hat{r}$. To avoid the singularity at $\\hat{r}=0$, the grid points are set as $\\hat{r}_i = (i+1)h$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, where the grid spacing is $h=1/N$. This grid spans the interval $[h, 1]$. The unknown functions $S(\\hat{r})$ and $G(\\hat{r})$ are represented by their values on these grid points, $S_i = S(\\hat{r}_i)$ and $G_i = G(\\hat{r}_i)$.\n\nThe state vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is formed by concatenating the discretized scalars:\n$$ \\mathbf{x} = [S_0, S_1, \\dots, S_{N-1}, G_0, G_1, \\dots, G_{N-1}]^T $$\nThis is a vector of size $2N$.\n\n**2. Finite-Difference Operators**\nWe use second-order finite-difference approximations for the derivatives.\nFor an interior point $\\hat{r}_i$ ($1 \\le i \\le N-2$):\nThe second derivative is approximated by the central difference formula:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 f}{d\\hat{r}^2} \\bigg|_{\\hat{r}_i} \\approx \\frac{f_{i+1} - 2f_i + f_{i-1}}{h^2} $$\nFor the boundary conditions, we need one-sided approximations for the first derivative:\n- At the inner boundary $\\hat{r}_0$: $f'(\\hat{r}_0) \\approx \\frac{-3f_0 + 4f_1 - f_2}{2h}$ (second-order forward difference).\n- At the outer boundary $\\hat{r}_{N-1}$: $f'(\\hat{r}_{N-1}) \\approx \\frac{3f_{N-1} - 4f_{N-2} + f_{N-3}}{2h}$ (second-order backward difference).\n\n**3. Matrix Assembly**\nThe discretized system is cast into the generalized eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{x} = \\hat{\\sigma}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{x}$. The matrices $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$ are of size $2N \\times 2N$.\n\n- **Matrix M:** This matrix isolates the terms proportional to the eigenvalue $\\hat{\\sigma}$. The nondimensional equations show that $\\hat{\\sigma}$ multiplies $S$ and $G$. For the interior points where the differential equations hold, the corresponding diagonal entries of $\\mathbf{M}$ are $1$. For the boundary points, where the equations are replaced by algebraic constraints independent of $\\hat{\\sigma}$, the corresponding rows of $\\mathbf{M}$ are zero. Thus, $M_{i,i} = 1$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N-2\\}$, $M_{N+i,N+i}=1$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N-2\\}$, and all other entries are zero.\n\n- **Matrix L:** This matrix represents the spatial differential operators and coupling terms.\n  - **Interior Rows ($1 \\le i \\le N-2$):**\n    - The $i$-th row corresponds to the $S$ equation at $\\hat{r}_i$:\n      $$ L_{i,i-1} = \\frac{1}{h^2}, \\quad L_{i,i} = -\\frac{2}{h^2} - \\frac{l(l+1)}{\\hat{r}_i^2}, \\quad L_{i,i+1} = \\frac{1}{h^2}, \\quad L_{i,N+i} = \\hat{\\alpha}(\\hat{r}_i) $$\n    - The $(N+i)$-th row corresponds to the $G$ equation at $\\hat{r}_i$:\n      $$ L_{N+i,N+i-1} = \\frac{1}{h^2}, \\quad L_{N+i,N+i} = -\\frac{2}{h^2} - \\frac{l(l+1)}{\\hat{r}_i^2}, \\quad L_{N+i,N+i+1} = \\frac{1}{h^2}, \\quad L_{N+i,i} = \\hat{\\alpha}(\\hat{r}_i)\\frac{l(l+1)}{\\hat{r}_i^2} $$\n  - **Boundary Rows:**\n    - **Row 0 (Inner BC for S):** $S'(\\hat{r}_0) - \\frac{l+1}{\\hat{r}_0}S_0 = 0$ is discretized as:\n      $$ \\left(-\\frac{3}{2h} - \\frac{l+1}{\\hat{r}_0}\\right)S_0 + \\left(\\frac{4}{2h}\\right)S_1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2h}\\right)S_2 = 0 $$\n      This sets the coefficients $L_{0,0}, L_{0,1}, L_{0,2}$.\n    - **Row N (Inner BC for G):** $G'(\\hat{r}_0) - \\frac{l}{\\hat{r}_0}G_0=0$ is discretized as:\n      $$ \\left(-\\frac{3}{2h} - \\frac{l}{\\hat{r}_0}\\right)G_0 + \\left(\\frac{4}{2h}\\right)G_1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2h}\\right)G_2 = 0 $$\n      This sets the coefficients $L_{N,N}, L_{N,N+1}, L_{N,N+2}$.\n    - **Row 2N-1 (Outer BC for G):** $G(\\hat{r}_{N-1})=0$ is a simple Dirichlet condition:\n      $$ G_{N-1} = 0 \\implies L_{2N-1, 2N-1} = 1 $$\n    - **Row N-1 (Outer BC for S):** $S'(\\hat{r}_{N-1}) + (l+1)S_{N-1}=0$ is discretized as:\n      $$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2h}\\right)S_{N-3} - \\left(\\frac{4}{2h}\\right)S_{N-2} + \\left(\\frac{3}{2h} + l+1\\right)S_{N-1} = 0 $$\n      This sets the coefficients $L_{N-1,N-3}, L_{N-1,N-2}, L_{N-1,N-1}$.\n\n**4. Solving and Post-processing**\nThe generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using `scipy.linalg.eig(L, M)`. Because the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is singular, the solver may produce infinite eigenvalues, which are unphysical and must be filtered out. Among the finite eigenvalues, we identify the one with the largest real part, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\max} = \\max(\\Re\\{\\hat{\\sigma}\\})$. This nondimensional growth rate is then converted to its dimensional form:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\max} = \\hat{\\sigma}_{\\max} \\frac{\\eta}{R^2} $$\nA dynamo is considered viable if it has a growing mode, i.e., $\\sigma_{\\max} > 0$.

This advanced practice demonstrates how such intricate dynamics can be captured and understood through simplified stochastic models. By conceptualizing the evolution of the dipole's amplitude as a particle moving in a double-well potential, you will apply the principles of first-passage theory to calculate the mean time between reversals, offering a powerful link between the microscopic parameters of a dynamo model and macroscopic, paleomagnetic observables .",

            "problem": "You will build and analyze a reduced model for global magnetic field reversals in a mean-field alpha–Omega (α–Ω) dynamo, focusing on the mean interval between reversals and its validation against paleomagnetic benchmarks. Start from the magnetohydrodynamic induction equation and the mean-field decomposition, and proceed to a one-dimensional stochastic amplitude equation that captures the large-scale axial dipole dynamics near a supercritical bifurcation. Then, using well-established first-passage theory for overdamped Langevin dynamics, derive and implement a formula for the mean time between noise-driven transitions (reversals) between the two stable polarity states. The final numerical results must be computed and reported in millions of years (Myr), rounded to three decimals, and compared to provided paleomagnetic targets.\n\nBegin with the following foundational base.\n\n1. Magnetohydrodynamic induction equation for the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ with velocity field $\\mathbf{U}$ and magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{U} \\times \\mathbf{B}) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}.\n$$\n\n2. Mean-field decomposition with Reynolds averaging and scale separation, introducing the turbulent electromotive force $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times \\left(\\langle \\mathbf{U} \\rangle \\times \\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle + \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}} \\right) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}} \\approx \\alpha \\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle - \\beta_t \\nabla \\times \\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the pseudo-scalar representing the alpha-effect (helical correlations) and $\\beta_t$ is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity. In an alpha–Omega (α–Ω) dynamo, large-scale shear $\\Omega$ couples poloidal and toroidal field components.\n\n3. Near the onset of dynamo action, the dynamics of the axial dipole amplitude $A(t)$ can be captured by a normal form for a supercritical pitchfork with cubic saturation, subject to fluctuations representing variability in $\\alpha$ and flow. This motivates a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) with additive Gaussian white noise of strength $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}A = \\left(\\mu A - \\beta A^3\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\, \\mathrm{d}W_t,\n$$\nwith $\\mu > 0$ measuring the net supercriticality (proportional to the dimensionless dynamo number combining $\\alpha$ and $\\Omega$ effects), $\\beta > 0$ a nonlinear saturation coefficient, and $W_t$ a Wiener process.\n\nYour tasks are as follows.\n\na) Using only the fundamental base above, argue why the stochastic amplitude equation can be written as an overdamped Langevin dynamics in a double-well potential $V(A)$, and identify $V(A)$ up to an additive constant. Carefully specify the correspondence between the SDE and the potential gradient flow.\n\nb) Using classical first-passage theory for overdamped Langevin motion in a smooth double-well potential, derive from first principles an analytical expression for the mean time between sign reversals (transitions between the two stable minima), expressed in terms of $\\mu$, $\\beta$, and $\\sigma$, and a specified base time scale $t_0$ that converts the nondimensional time to physical units of millions of years (Myr). You must assume the regime where the two stable equilibria exist and are separated by a single saddle. Your derivation must make explicit the barrier height and the relevant curvatures at the minimum and at the saddle.\n\nc) Implement a complete and runnable program that computes the mean reversal interval in Myr for each parameter set below, using your derived expression. For validation against paleomagnetic records, compute the absolute difference between the model prediction and the provided target mean reversal interval, and report whether this difference is less than or equal to a given tolerance.\n\nImplementation requirements.\n\n- You must use the analytical expression derived in part (b); do not perform direct stochastic simulation.\n- If the parameters do not produce a bistable double-well (for example, if $\\mu \\le 0$ or $\\beta \\le 0$), return a floating-point Not-a-Number for the predicted mean and propagate the comparison as not within tolerance.\n- All final reported time values must be in Myr, rounded to three decimals.\n- The program must be deterministic and require no input.\n\nTest suite.\n\nCompute the results for the following three cases, each specified by $(\\mu,\\beta,\\sigma,t_0)$ along with the paleomagnetic target mean and an absolute tolerance, all times in Myr.\n\n- Case 1 (moderate noise, frequent reversals): $\\mu = 30.0$, $\\beta = 1.0$, $\\sigma = 20.2$, $t_0 = 1.0$, target $= 0.45$, tolerance $= 0.10$.\n- Case 2 (weaker driving, intermediate reversals): $\\mu = 15.0$, $\\beta = 1.0$, $\\sigma = 10.0$, $t_0 = 1.0$, target $= 0.90$, tolerance $= 0.15$.\n- Case 3 (strongly stable, rare reversals): $\\mu = 10.0$, $\\beta = 1.0$, $\\sigma = 3.0$, $t_0 = 1.0$, target $= 100.0$, tolerance $= 30.0$.\n\nFinal output format.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing all results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each case, in order, output a triple consisting of:\n- the predicted mean reversal interval in Myr rounded to three decimals,\n- the absolute difference to the target in Myr rounded to three decimals,\n- a boolean indicating whether the absolute difference is less than or equal to the tolerance.\n\nThus the output list contains $3$ tuples flattened in sequence, yielding $9$ entries total, for example\n$[x_1,\\Delta_1,b_1,x_2,\\Delta_2,b_2,x_3,\\Delta_3,b_3]$,\nwhere each $x_i$ and $\\Delta_i$ are floats rounded to three decimals and each $b_i$ is a boolean.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a valid problem in theoretical planetary physics.\n\n**Part a) Identification of the Double-Well Potential**\n\nThe provided stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the axial dipole amplitude $A(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}A = \\left(\\mu A - \\beta A^3\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\, \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThis equation is a canonical example of an overdamped Langevin equation, which describes the motion of a particle in a potential $V(A)$ subject to a deterministic force $F(A)$ and a stochastic force term. The general form is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}A = F(A)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\, \\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nIn a gradient system, the deterministic force is derived from the potential as $F(A) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}A}$.\n\nBy comparing the two equations, we identify the deterministic force component as:\n$$\nF(A) = \\mu A - \\beta A^3\n$$\nTo find the potential $V(A)$, we must integrate the negative of the force with respect to $A$:\n$$\nV(A) = - \\int F(A) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = - \\int \\left(\\mu A - \\beta A^3\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\nV(A) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mu A^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\\beta A^4\\right) + C_0\n$$\nwhere $C_0$ is an arbitrary constant of integration. We can set $C_0 = 0$ without loss of generality, as it only shifts the potential vertically and does not affect the dynamics. Thus, the potential is:\n$$\nV(A) = \\frac{1}{4}\\beta A^4 - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu A^2\n$$\nTo demonstrate that this represents a double-well potential, we must find its extrema by setting the first derivative (the force) to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}A} = \\beta A^3 - \\mu A = A(\\beta A^2 - \\mu) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system is near a supercritical bifurcation, implying $\\mu > 0$, and that there is nonlinear saturation, implying $\\beta > 0$. Under these conditions, the fixed points (extrema) are:\n$$\nA_0 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}}\n$$\nTo determine the stability of these points, we examine the second derivative of the potential, $V''(A)$:\n$$\nV''(A) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}A^2} = 3\\beta A^2 - \\mu\n$$\nAt $A = A_0 = 0$, the curvature is $V''(0) = -\\mu$. Since $\\mu > 0$, this is negative, indicating that $A_0 = 0$ is a local maximum. This corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the deterministic dynamics.\n\nAt $A = A_{\\pm} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\beta}$, the curvature is:\n$$\nV''\\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}}\\right) = 3\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}\\right) - \\mu = 3\\mu - \\mu = 2\\mu\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, this is positive, indicating that $A_{\\pm}$ are local minima. These correspond to the two stable fixed points of the deterministic dynamics, representing the two stable magnetic polarity states.\n\nThe existence of two minima ($A_{\\pm}$) separated by a maximum ($A_0$) confirms that $V(A)$ is a double-well potential for $\\mu > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$. The magnetic field reversals are noise-driven transitions between these two potential wells.\n\n**Part b) Derivation of the Mean Reversal Interval**\n\nThe mean time for a particle to escape from one potential well over a barrier, driven by noise, is described by Kramers' escape rate theory. In the overdamped limit, for a system described by $\\mathrm{d}A = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}A}\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$, the mean first-passage time (MFPT) $\\tau$ to escape from a minimum $A_{min}$ over a saddle $A_{saddle}$ is given by the Arrhenius-type formula:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{|V''(A_{saddle})| V''(A_{min})}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\,\\Delta V}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta V = V(A_{saddle}) - V(A_{min})$ is the height of the potential barrier. Some literature defines the SDE in terms of a diffusion coefficient $D=\\sigma^2/2$, in which case the argument of the exponential is $\\Delta V/D$.\n\nFrom Part (a), we have all the necessary components:\n1.  The stable minima are at $A_{min} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu/\\beta}$. We can choose the positive root for calculation due to symmetry: $A_{min} = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\beta}$.\n2.  The saddle point is at $A_{saddle} = 0$.\n3.  The potential values at these points are:\n    $$\n    V(A_{saddle}) = V(0) = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    V(A_{min}) = V\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\beta} - \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\beta} = -\\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\beta}\n    $$\n4.  The potential barrier height $\\Delta V$ is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\Delta V = V(A_{saddle}) - V(A_{min}) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\beta}\n    $$\n5.  The curvatures (second derivatives) at these points are:\n    $$\n    V''(A_{min}) = V''\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\beta}}\\right) = 2\\mu\n    $$\n    $$\n    V''(A_{saddle}) = V''(0) = -\\mu \\implies |V''(A_{saddle})| = \\mu\n    $$\n\nNow, we substitute these quantities into the MFPT formula:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{(\\mu)(2\\mu)}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2(\\mu^2/4\\beta)}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{2\\mu^2}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\beta\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu\\sqrt{2}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\beta\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{\\mu} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\beta\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the mean reversal interval $\\tau$ in non-dimensional time units. To convert this to a physical time $T$ in millions of years (Myr), we multiply by the provided base time scale $t_0$ (in Myr):\n$$\nT = t_0 \\cdot \\tau = t_0 \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{\\mu} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\beta\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression to be implemented.\n\n**Part c) Implementation**\n\nThe derived formula for the mean reversal interval $T$ will be implemented in a Python program. The program will first validate the parameters for each test case to ensure $\\mu > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$, as the double-well potential structure relies on these conditions. If the conditions are not met, the result will be Not-a-Number (NaN) as required. Otherwise, it will compute $T$, calculate the absolute difference to the paleomagnetic target, and evaluate the tolerance condition. The results will be rounded and formatted as specified.",
