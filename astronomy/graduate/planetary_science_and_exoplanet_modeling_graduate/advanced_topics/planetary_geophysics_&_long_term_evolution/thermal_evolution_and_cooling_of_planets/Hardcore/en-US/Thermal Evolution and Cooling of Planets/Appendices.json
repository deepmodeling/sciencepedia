There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the nondimensional group controlling convection, its evaluation, and a stability assessment based on that value. We begin with the governing equations for an incompressible fluid under the Boussinesq approximation.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.  **Conservation of Mass (Continuity):** For an incompressible fluid, the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ is solenoidal.\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum (Navier-Stokes):**\n    $$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\right) = -\\nabla P + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\rho \\mathbf{g} $$\n    Here, $P$ is the pressure, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector.\n3.  **Conservation of Energy (Heat Equation):**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T = \\kappa \\nabla^2 T $$\n    Here, $T$ is the temperature and $\\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe Boussinesq approximation assumes that density variations are small and only affect the buoyancy term. The density $\\rho$ is related to a reference density $\\rho_0$ at a reference temperature $T_0$ by:\n$$ \\rho = \\rho_0 (1 - \\alpha (T-T_0)) $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansivity. The momentum equation can be written in terms of perturbations from a hydrostatic reference state. Let $P = P_{hydro} + p$ and $\\rho = \\rho_0 + \\rho'$, where $\\nabla P_{hydro} = \\rho_0 \\mathbf{g}$ and $\\rho' = -\\rho_0 \\alpha (T-T_0)$. For mantle convection, the viscous forces are dominant over inertial forces (infinite Prandtl number limit). The Prandtl number is $Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho_0 \\kappa}$. Using the given values, $Pr = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{21}}{(4.50 \\times 10^3)(1.0 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{24}$, which is enormous. Thus, the inertial term $\\rho(\\partial_t \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\mathbf{u})$ is negligible. The momentum equation simplifies to the Stokes equation with a buoyancy term:\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} - \\rho_0 \\alpha (T-T_0) \\mathbf{g} $$\nLet's set the coordinate system with the z-axis pointing upwards, so $\\mathbf{g} = -g \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The temperature field is decomposed into a linear conductive profile $T_{cond}(z)$ and a perturbation $\\theta$:\n$$ T(x,y,z,t) = T_b - \\Delta T \\frac{z}{d} + \\theta(x,y,z,t) $$\nwhere $T_b$ is the temperature at the bottom boundary ($z=0$) and $\\Delta T$ is the superadiabatic temperature drop across the layer of thickness $d$. The buoyancy term can now be written in terms of the perturbation $\\theta$. The non-hydrostatic part of the buoyancy term is $-\\rho_0 \\alpha \\theta g$. The momentum equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla p_{dyn} + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\rho_0 \\alpha g \\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nwhere $p_{dyn}$ is the dynamic pressure. Substituting the temperature decomposition into the energy equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\theta - u_z \\frac{\\Delta T}{d} = \\kappa \\nabla^2 \\theta $$\nwhere $u_z$ is the vertical component of velocity.\n\nWe now nondimensionalize these equations using the specified scales:\n-   Length: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x}/d$\n-   Time: $t' = t / (d^2/\\kappa)$\n-   Velocity: $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} / (\\kappa/d)$\n-   Temperature perturbation: $\\theta' = \\theta / \\Delta T$\n-   Dynamic pressure: $p'_{dyn} = p_{dyn} / (\\eta \\kappa / d^2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the Stokes and energy equations and dropping the primes for clarity:\n**Momentum Equation:**\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla \\left(p'_{dyn} \\frac{\\eta \\kappa}{d^2}\\right) + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\left(\\mathbf{u}' \\frac{\\kappa}{d}\\right) + \\rho_0 \\alpha g (\\theta' \\Delta T) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\n$$ 0 = -\\left(\\frac{\\eta \\kappa}{d^3}\\right) \\nabla' p'_{dyn} + \\left(\\frac{\\eta \\kappa}{d^3}\\right) \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{u}' + (\\rho_0 \\alpha g \\Delta T) \\theta' \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $d^3/(\\eta \\kappa)$:\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla' p'_{dyn} + \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{u}' + \\left(\\frac{\\rho_0 \\alpha g \\Delta T d^3}{\\eta \\kappa}\\right) \\theta' \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nThe nondimensional group that appears is the **Rayleigh number**, $Ra$:\n$$ Ra = \\frac{\\rho_0 \\alpha g \\Delta T d^3}{\\eta \\kappa} $$\nThis number represents the ratio of buoyant driving forces to viscous and thermal diffusive dissipation.\n\n**Energy Equation:**\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\theta' \\Delta T)}{\\partial (t' d^2/\\kappa)} + \\left(\\mathbf{u}' \\frac{\\kappa}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\nabla'}{d}\\right) (\\theta' \\Delta T) - u'_z \\frac{\\kappa}{d} \\frac{\\Delta T}{d} = \\kappa \\frac{\\nabla'^2}{d^2} (\\theta' \\Delta T) $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\kappa \\Delta T}{d^2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\theta'}{\\partial t'} + \\left(\\frac{\\kappa \\Delta T}{d^2}\\right) (\\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla') \\theta' - \\left(\\frac{\\kappa \\Delta T}{d^2}\\right) u'_z = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa \\Delta T}{d^2}\\right) \\nabla'^2 \\theta' $$\nDividing by $(\\kappa \\Delta T/d^2)$ yields the dimensionless energy equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta'}{\\partial t'} + \\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla' \\theta' - u'_z = \\nabla'^2 \\theta' $$\n\nThe controlling nondimensional parameter is the Rayleigh number, $Ra$. We now evaluate it using the provided values (using $\\rho$ for $\\rho_0$ as given):\n$$ Ra = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}) (4.50 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) (3.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{K}) (2.8 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^3}{(5.0 \\times 10^{21}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\,s}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}})} $$\nCalculating the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (3.0 \\times 10^{-5}) (4.50 \\times 10^{3}) (9.81) (3.00 \\times 10^{2}) (2.8^3 \\times 10^{18}) $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (397.305) (21.952 \\times 10^{18}) \\approx 8.7218 \\times 10^{21} $$\nCalculating the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (5.0 \\times 10^{21}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{15} $$\nThus, the Rayleigh number is:\n$$ Ra = \\frac{8.7218 \\times 10^{21}}{5.0 \\times 10^{15}} = 1.74436 \\times 10^6 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $Ra = 1.74 \\times 10^6$.\n\nTo determine if the mantle is convecting, we compare this value to the critical Rayleigh number, $Ra_c$, for the onset of convection.

Since $1.74 \\times 10^6 \\gg 1708$, the Rayleigh number for this planetary mantle is many orders of magnitude larger than the critical value.

The assumption that properties like $\\rho, g, \\alpha, \\kappa, k,$ and $\\Delta T$ are identical for both cases is a standard simplifying assumption in such comparative studies, allowing for the isolation of the effect of viscosity. There are no contradictions.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in planetary geodynamics. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to determine the relationship between the convective heat flux $q$ and the mantle viscosity $\\eta$, and then use this relationship to find the ratio of heat flux for a hydrated (\"wet\") mantle to that of a dry mantle. The derivation will be based on the principles of thermal boundary layer theory for high Rayleigh number convection.\n\nThe problem states that the mantle is in the mobile-lid regime and has a marginally stable thermal boundary layer. This implies that the local Rayleigh number of the upper thermal boundary layer, $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\delta}$, is approximately equal to a critical value, $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The local Rayleigh number is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\delta} = \\frac{\\rho g \\alpha \\Delta T \\delta^3}{\\kappa \\eta}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the thickness of the thermal boundary layer, $\\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, and $\\Delta T$ is the temperature drop across the boundary layer. The other parameters are density $\\rho$, gravitational acceleration $g$, thermal expansivity $\\alpha$, and thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$.\n\nThe condition of marginal stability is thus expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\delta} \\approx \\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is a constant on the order of $10^3$. We can treat this as an equality to solve for the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho g \\alpha \\Delta T \\delta^3}{\\kappa \\eta} = \\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta^3$:\n$$\n\\delta^3 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\kappa \\eta}{\\rho g \\alpha \\Delta T}\n$$\nThus, the thickness of the thermal boundary layer depends on viscosity as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\kappa}{\\rho g \\alpha \\Delta T} \\right)^{1/3} \\eta^{1/3}\n$$\nThis shows that $\\delta \\propto \\eta^{1/3}$.\n\nNext, we use Fourier's law of heat conduction to express the heat flux through this boundary layer. The problem specifies that conservation of energy in the boundary layer is a key principle, which means the convective heat flux from the mantle's interior is transported conductively through the quasi-static boundary layer. The heat flux $q$ is therefore given by:\n$$\nq = k \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. This shows that $q \\propto \\delta^{-1}$.\n\nWe can now combine these two relationships to find how the heat flux $q$ depends on viscosity $\\eta$. Substituting the expression for $\\delta$ into the equation for $q$:\n$$\nq = k \\Delta T \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\kappa}{\\rho g \\alpha \\Delta T} \\right)^{1/3} \\eta^{1/3} \\right)^{-1} = k \\Delta T \\left( \\frac{\\rho g \\alpha \\Delta T}{\\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\kappa} \\right)^{1/3} \\eta^{-1/3}\n$$\nSince all parameters except viscosity ($\\rho, g, \\alpha, \\Delta T, \\kappa, k, \\mathrm{Ra}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$) are identical for both the wet and dry cases, we can express this as a proportionality:\n$$\nq \\propto \\eta^{-1/3}\n$$\n\nWith this scaling law, we can compute the ratio of the convective heat flux in the hydrated mantle, $q_{\\mathrm{wet}}$, to that in the dry mantle, $q_{\\mathrm{dry}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{q_{\\mathrm{dry}}} = \\frac{A \\eta_{\\mathrm{wet}}^{-1/3}}{A \\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}}^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}}} \\right)^{-1/3}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of proportionality, and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{wet}}$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}}$ are the viscosities of the wet and dry mantles, respectively.\n\nThe problem provides the rheological law relating viscosity to water content $C_w$:\n$$\n\\eta(C_{w}) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}} \\left( \\frac{C_{w}}{C_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)^{-r}\n$$\nHere, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}}$ is the viscosity at the reference water content $C_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The \"dry\" mantle case corresponds to this reference state, so its viscosity is indeed $\\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}}$. The \"wet\" mantle has a water content $C_{w} = 100$ ppm wt. Its viscosity, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{wet}}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{wet}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}} \\left( \\frac{100 \\text{ ppm wt}}{C_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)^{-r}\n$$\nThe reference water content is given as $C_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10$ ppm wt. Therefore, the ratio of viscosities is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{dry}}} = \\left( \\frac{100 \\text{ ppm wt}}{10 \\text{ ppm wt}} \\right)^{-r} = (10)^{-r}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this viscosity ratio into the expression for the heat flux ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{q_{\\mathrm{dry}}} = \\left( (10)^{-r} \\right)^{-1/3} = (10)^{r/3}\n$$\n\nThe problem gives the value of the water-weakening exponent as $r = 1.2$. We can now compute the numerical value of the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{q_{\\mathrm{dry}}} = (10)^{1.2/3} = (10)^{0.4}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n(10)^{0.4} \\approx 2.5118864...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $2.512$.\n\nThus, the presence of $100$ ppm wt of water in the mantle, compared to a reference state of $10$ ppm wt, enhances the convective heat flux by a factor of approximately $2.512$ due to the reduction in mantle viscosity.",

Use exactly these parameter values:\n\n- Test Case A (Earth-like baseline, monotonic heat loss):\n  - $C_m = 4.8 \\times 10^{27}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$,\n  - $T_s = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n  - $\\alpha = 3.6 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{W/K}$,\n  - $\\beta = 1.0$,\n  - $H_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{W}$,\n  - $\\lambda = 1.5 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$,\n  - $T_0 = 1600\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n  - $t_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Test Case B (boundary case: no internal heating):\n  - $C_m = 4.8 \\times 10^{27}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$,\n  - $T_s = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n  - $\\alpha = 3.6 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{W/K}$,\n  - $\\beta = 1.0$,\n  - $H_0 = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{W}$,\n  - $\\lambda = 1.5 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$,\n  - $T_0 = 1600\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n  - $t_f = 5.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- Test Case C (nonlinear heat loss sensitivity):\n  - $C_m = 4.8 \\times 10^{27}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$,\n  - $T_s = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n  - $\\alpha = \\dfrac{4.7 \\times 10^{13}}{\\left(1300\\right)^{1.3}}\\ \\mathrm{W/K^{1.3}}$,\n  - $\\beta = 1.3$,\n  - $H_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{W}$,\n  - $\\lambda = 1.5 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$,\n  - $T_0 = 1600\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n  - $t_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Formulate the ODE $C_m \\,\\dfrac{dT_m}{dt} = H_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) - \\alpha \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^\\beta$ and implement a robust numerical integrator that respects the physical constraint $T_m(t) \\ge T_s$.\n- For each test case, compute $T_\\mathrm{eq}$, the stability boolean by evaluating the sign of $f'(T_\\mathrm{eq})$, and $T_m(t_f)$.\n- Produce the single-line output in the exact format $[[T_\\mathrm{eq,A}, \\text{is\\_stable,A}, T_m(t_f)\\text{,A}],[T_\\mathrm{eq,B}, \\text{is\\_stable,B}, T_m(t_f)\\text{,B}],[T_\\mathrm{eq,C}, \\text{is\\_stable,C}, T_m(t_f)\\text{,C}]]$, with the temperatures rounded to two decimal places, and booleans as plain $\\text{True}$ or $\\text{False}$.",
            "solution": "The energy balance for a planet’s mantle provides the fundamental base: the rate of change of internal energy equals internal heating minus outward heat loss. Let the mantle temperature be $T_m(t)$, the constant total mantle heat capacity be $C_m$ in $\\mathrm{J/K}$, internal heating be $H(t)$ in $\\mathrm{W}$, and heat loss be $Q(T_m)$ in $\\mathrm{W}$. Conservation of energy yields\n$$\nC_m \\,\\frac{dT_m}{dt} \\;=\\; H(t) \\;-\\; Q(T_m).\n$$\nWith prescribed radiogenic heating $H(t) = H_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $H_0$ is the initial heating and $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, and a physically motivated monotonic heat-loss parameterization $Q(T_m) = \\alpha \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^\\beta$ with $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$, the governing ODE becomes\n$$\nC_m \\,\\frac{dT_m}{dt} \\;=\\; H_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\;-\\; \\alpha \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^\\beta,\n$$\nwith the physical constraint $T_m(t) \\ge T_s$.\n\nFixed points (thermal equilibria) under constant heating satisfy\n$$\nH_0 \\;=\\; Q(T_m) \\;=\\; \\alpha \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^\\beta.\n$$\nDenoting any equilibrium temperature by $T_\\mathrm{eq}$, the equilibrium condition is the root of the function\n$$\ng(T_m) \\;=\\; \\alpha \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^\\beta \\;-\\; H_0.\n$$\nFor $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$, the function $g(T_m)$ is strictly increasing on $T_m \\ge T_s$, so there is a unique solution $T_\\mathrm{eq} \\ge T_s$ for each $H_0 \\ge 0$. In particular, $H_0 = 0$ gives $T_\\mathrm{eq} = T_s$, and $H_0  0$ gives $T_\\mathrm{eq}  T_s$.\n\nLinear stability of $T_\\mathrm{eq}$ follows from linearizing the ODE about $T_\\mathrm{eq}$. Define\n$$\nf(T_m) \\;\\equiv\\; \\frac{1}{C_m} \\left( H_0 - Q(T_m) \\right).\n$$\nThe linearized evolution for a small perturbation $\\delta T$ from equilibrium is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\,\\delta T}{dt} \\;=\\; f'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) \\,\\delta T,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nf'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) \\;=\\; -\\frac{1}{C_m} \\, Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq}).\n$$\nFor the power-law heat loss $Q(T_m) = \\alpha \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^\\beta$, the derivative is\n$$\nQ'(T_m) \\;=\\; \\alpha \\,\\beta \\left(T_m - T_s\\right)^{\\beta - 1}.\n$$\nEvaluated at equilibrium $T_\\mathrm{eq}$ with $T_\\mathrm{eq} \\ge T_s$, we have $Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) \\ge 0$ and strictly $Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq})  0$ for $H_0  0$. Therefore,\n$$\nf'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) \\;=\\; -\\frac{Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq})}{C_m} \\;\\; 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad H_0  0,\n$$\nwhich implies exponential decay of perturbations and linear stability. In the boundary case $H_0 = 0$ with $T_\\mathrm{eq} = T_s$, the one-sided derivative $Q'(T)$ for $T  T_s$ remains nonnegative, and the sign of the restoring term for small positive perturbations is negative, confirming stability in the physically relevant domain $T_m \\ge T_s$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n\n1. Equilibrium computation: For $H_0 \\ge 0$, solve $H_0 = \\alpha \\left(T_\\mathrm{eq} - T_s\\right)^\\beta$. Because $g(T_m)$ is strictly increasing, the solution is unique. For $H_0 = 0$, $T_\\mathrm{eq} = T_s$. For $H_0  0$, invert the monotonic relation to obtain $T_\\mathrm{eq}$ satisfying the equilibrium condition.\n\n2. Stability classification: Evaluate $Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) = \\alpha \\,\\beta \\left(T_\\mathrm{eq} - T_s\\right)^{\\beta - 1}$. The equilibrium is stable if $f'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) = - Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq}) / C_m  0$, which holds whenever $Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq})  0$. In the boundary case $T_\\mathrm{eq} = T_s$, stability is verified by the sign of the restoring term for $T_m  T_s$.\n\n3. Time integration: Numerically integrate\n$$\n\\frac{dT_m}{dt} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{C_m} \\left( H_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) - \\alpha \\left(\\max\\{T_m - T_s, 0\\}\\right)^\\beta \\right)\n$$\nfrom $t = 0$ to $t = t_f$ with initial $T_m(0) = T_0$, using an adaptive ODE solver with suitable absolute and relative tolerances. The $\\max\\{T_m - T_s, 0\\}$ enforces the physical constraint $T_m \\ge T_s$ by nullifying heat loss if a numerical trajectory attempts to dip below $T_s$. Extract $T_m(t_f)$ and round to two decimals.\n\nTest suite application:\n\n- Test Case A computes $T_\\mathrm{eq}$ for $H_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{W}$ and baseline parameters, classifies stability, and integrates to $t_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{s}$. For $\\beta = 1.0$, equilibrium is uniquely determined and stable.\n\n- Test Case B sets $H_0 = 0$ as a boundary case. The only equilibrium is $T_\\mathrm{eq} = T_s$, and stability is ensured by the monotonicity of $Q(T_m)$ for $T_m  T_s$. Integration demonstrates cooling toward $T_s$.\n\n- Test Case C uses nonlinear heat loss with $\\beta = 1.3$ and $\\alpha$ chosen such that $\\alpha \\left(1300\\right)^{1.3} \\approx 4.7 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{W}$ to probe sensitivity. Stability follows from the positivity of $Q'(T_\\mathrm{eq})$ and the solution demonstrates the impact of stronger-than-linear heat-loss dependence.\n\nThe program implements these steps, computes the requested quantities for each test case, and prints a single line containing $[[T_\\mathrm{eq,A}, \\text{is\\_stable,A}, T_m(t_f)\\text{,A}],[T_\\mathrm{eq,B}, \\text{is\\_stable,B}, T_m(t_f)\\text{,B}],[T_\\mathrm{eq,C}, \\text{is\\_stable,C}, T_m(t_f)\\text{,C}]]$ with temperatures rounded to two decimal places and booleans indicating stability.",
