This first exercise reinforces this core idea by having you derive the orbital distance corresponding to the outer edge of the HZ. By applying the inverse-square law for radiation, you will calculate the 'maximum greenhouse' limit for a Sun-like star, providing a quantitative anchor for the HZ concept. ",

Consider a Sun-like star with luminosity $L_{\\star}$ and the Sun’s luminosity $L_{\\odot}$. Assume isotropic stellar radiation and no intervening absorption between the star and the planet so that the stellar flux at distance $a$ follows the inverse-square law. \n\nStarting from first principles, use the inverse-square scaling of radiative flux and the definition of $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to derive an analytic expression for the orbital distance $a$ (in AU) corresponding to a given $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $L_{\\star}/L_{\\odot}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and definitions for a unique solution are provided. The physical principles invoked—the inverse-square law for radiative flux and the definition of a habitable zone boundary via an effective stellar flux—are standard in planetary science and astrophysics. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins from first principles, specifically the inverse-square law for the flux of isotropically radiated energy. The radiative flux $F$ at a distance $r$ from a source with luminosity $L$ is given by:\n$$F = \\frac{L}{4 \\pi r^{2}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the star in question has a luminosity $L_{\\star}$ and the planet orbits it at a distance $a$. The flux received by this planet, $F_{\\mathrm{planet}}$, is therefore:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{planet}} = \\frac{L_{\\star}}{4 \\pi a^{2}}$$\nThe problem defines the effective stellar flux, $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, as the ratio of $F_{\\mathrm{planet}}$ to the flux received by Earth from the Sun. The Earth orbits the Sun (luminosity $L_{\\odot}$) at a distance of $1$ Astronomical Unit ($1~\\mathrm{AU}$). The flux received by Earth, $F_{\\mathrm{Earth}}$, is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{Earth}} = \\frac{L_{\\odot}}{4 \\pi (1~\\mathrm{AU})^{2}}$$\nAccording to the problem's definition of $S_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{planet}}}{F_{\\mathrm{Earth}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{\\mathrm{planet}}$ and $F_{\\mathrm{Earth}}$ into this definition yields:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\frac{L_{\\star}}{4 \\pi a^{2}}}{\\frac{L_{\\odot}}{4 \\pi (1~\\mathrm{AU})^{2}}}$$\nThe factor of $4 \\pi$ cancels, and we can rearrange the expression to group the luminosity and distance terms:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{\\star}}{L_{\\odot}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{(1~\\mathrm{AU})^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{L_{\\star}}{L_{\\odot}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1~\\mathrm{AU}}{a}\\right)^{2}$$\nThe problem requires an expression for the orbital distance $a$ in units of AU. Let us represent this quantity as $a_{\\mathrm{AU}} = a / (1~\\mathrm{AU})$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{\\star}}{L_{\\odot}}\\right) \\frac{1}{a_{\\mathrm{AU}}^{2}}$$\nWe now solve for $a_{\\mathrm{AU}}$, which is the desired analytic expression for the orbital distance in AU.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{AU}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\left(\\frac{L_{\\star}}{L_{\\odot}}\\right)$$\n$$a_{\\mathrm{AU}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\star}/L_{\\odot}}{S_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the orbital distance $a$ in AU.\n\nNext, we apply this expression to the specific case given in the problem: a Sun-like star with $L_{\\star} = L_{\\odot}$ (so the luminosity ratio $L_{\\star}/L_{\\odot} = 1$) and an outer-edge HZ threshold of $S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.36$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{AU}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.36}}$$\n$$a_{\\mathrm{AU}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.36}} = \\frac{1}{0.6} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{AU}} = 1.666...$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures.\n$$a_{\\mathrm{AU}} \\approx 1.67$$\nThus, the outer-edge HZ distance is $1.67~\\mathrm{AU}$.\n\nThe physical meaning of this result is that for a star with the same luminosity as our Sun, the outer boundary of the habitable zone is located at approximately $1.67$ times the Earth-Sun distance. A planet at this distance receives only $36\\%$ of the stellar flux that Earth receives. This specific threshold, $S_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.36$, corresponds to a climatic limit often called the \"maximum greenhouse\" limit in 1-D climate models. It represents the maximum distance at which a terrestrial planet with a dense carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$) atmosphere could maintain surface temperatures above the freezing point of water ($273.15~\\mathrm{K}$). Beyond this distance, it is theorized that even an atmosphere saturated with $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ would be insufficient to prevent runaway glaciation, rendering the planet inhospitable to life as we know it. This calculation represents a static, first-order approximation. The concept of the HZ has evolved to incorporate factors such as stellar evolution (which causes the HZ to migrate outwards over billions of years), atmospheric composition and clouds, planetary mass, and orbital eccentricity, all of which introduce significant complexity beyond this simple flux-based definition.",

A more effective approach is to change the variable of integration from time $t$ to the true anomaly $\\theta$. This tranformation is facilitated by Kepler's second law of planetary motion, which states that the specific angular momentum, $h$, is a constant of motion. The magnitude of the specific angular momentum is twice the rate at which area is swept by the radius vector $\\vec{r}$:\n$$\nh = |\\vec{r} \\times \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}| = r^{2} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the differential element of time $dt$ in terms of the differential element of the true anomaly $d\\theta$:\n$$\ndt = \\frac{r^{2}}{h} d\\theta\n$$\nWe can now substitute this into the integral for $\\overline{S}$.

If desiccation occurs, find the desiccation time by solving for the root of $g(t) = M_{H}(t) - f_{H}\\,M_{\\mathrm{ocean},0}$ using a bracketing root finder; convert to megayears and round appropriately.\n- Prepare the output as a list of lists for the three test cases: $[\\,[f_{\\mathrm{loss}}, b, \\tau_{\\mathrm{desic}}], \\ldots]$, where $b$ is $1$ if desiccation occurs and $0$ otherwise, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{desic}}$ is the desiccation time in megayears or $-1.0$ if no desiccation occurs.\n\nScientific realism and connection to the habitable zone concept: Low-mass stars exhibit extended pre-main-sequence phases with elevated XUV fluxes. The habitable zone, defined by ranges of stellar flux permitting surface liquid water, evolves as the star contracts and its bolometric luminosity changes. Hydrodynamic escape powered by XUV can remove large quantities of water from planets that will later lie within the classical habitable zone, effectively altering their potential habitability. The model above quantifies the cumulative water loss and assesses whether desiccation occurs before the habitable zone stabilizes, thereby integrating atmospheric escape physics with the temporal evolution of habitability.\n\nThe numerical method using piecewise flux history, energy-limited escape with diffusion cap, and robust integration ensures coverage of cases where energy-limited escape dominates, where diffusion supply limits escape, and where cold-trapping yields negligible hydrogen supply. The test suite thus probes a typical pre-main-sequence M-dwarf scenario, a sub-Earth diffusion-limited edge case, and a boundary case with partial loss.",
