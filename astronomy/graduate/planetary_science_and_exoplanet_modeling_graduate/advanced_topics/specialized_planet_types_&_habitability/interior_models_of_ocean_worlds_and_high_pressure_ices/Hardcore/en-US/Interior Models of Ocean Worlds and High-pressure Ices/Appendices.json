This first practice establishes the baseline by guiding you through a first-principles derivation of the central pressure inside a simplified, uniform-density sphere.

Let the sphere have radius $R$, total mass $M$, and constant density $\\rho$. Assume Newtonian gravity with gravitational constant $G$ and hydrostatic equilibrium. Use the following foundational relations: the hydrostatic equilibrium equation $dP/dr=-\\rho\\,g(r)$, the interior gravitational acceleration $g(r)=G\\,m(r)/r^{2}$, and the enclosed mass $m(r)=4\\pi\\int_{0}^{r}\\rho\\,r'^{2}\\,dr'$.

The model is defined by a constant density $\\rho$, total radius $R$, and total mass $M$. We begin with the fundamental equations provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the enclosed mass $m(r)$ at a radius $r$ by integrating the density.

            "problem": "An interior model of an icy ocean world must include a thermodynamically consistent phase transition between high-pressure ice phases. Around the ice VI–ice VII boundary at approximately $P \\sim 2$ GPa and laboratory temperature $T \\approx 300$ K, a naive stitching of phase-specific Equation of State (EOS) segments can yield a non-convex, non-monotonic pressure–molar volume isotherm.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the coexistence pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{coex}}$, for a first-order phase transition described by a given non-monotonic equation of state (EOS), $P(v)$. The procedure to enforce thermodynamic consistency is the Maxwell construction.\n\nThe fundamental condition for two phases, denoted by subscripts $1$ and $2$, to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at a constant temperature $T$ is the equality of their pressures $P$ and molar Gibbs free energies $g$.\nThe coexistence pressure $P_{\\mathrm{coex}}$ is thus the pressure at which the two phases coexist. Let the molar volumes of the two phases at this pressure be $v_1$ and $v_2$. The equilibrium conditions are:\n$$P(v_1) = P(v_2) = P_{\\mathrm{coex}}$$\n$$g(T, P_{\\mathrm{coex}}, \\text{phase } 1) = g(T, P_{\\mathrm{coex}}, \\text{phase } 2)$$\nThe molar Gibbs free energy $g$ is related to the molar Helmholtz free energy $f$ by the definition $g = f + Pv$. Therefore, the second condition becomes:\n$$f(v_1) + P_{\\mathrm{coex}}v_1 = f(v_2) + P_{\\mathrm{coex}}v_2$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the difference in Helmholtz free energy between the two states:\n$$f(v_2) - f(v_1) = -P_{\\mathrm{coex}}(v_2 - v_1)$$\nThe problem statement provides the fundamental thermodynamic relation at constant temperature $T$:\n$$df = -P\\,dv$$\nWe can find the difference in Helmholtz free energy between states $(T, v_1)$ and $(T, v_2)$ by integrating this relation along the path defined by the given (partially unphysical) EOS, $P(v)$:\n$$f(v_2) - f(v_1) = \\int_{f(v_1)}^{f(v_2)} df = -\\int_{v_1}^{v_2} P(v)\\,dv$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $f(v_2) - f(v_1)$, we arrive at the Maxwell construction condition:\n$$-P_{\\mathrm{coex}}(v_2 - v_1) = -\\int_{v_1}^{v_2} P(v)\\,dv$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{coex}}(v_2 - v_1) = \\int_{v_1}^{v_2} P(v)\\,dv$$\nThis is the \"equal area rule,\" which states that the area of the rectangle with height $P_{\\mathrm{coex}}$ and width $(v_2 - v_1)$ is equal to the area under the $P(v)$ curve from $v_1$ to $v_2$. An equivalent and useful form is:\n$$\\int_{v_1}^{v_2} \\bigl(P(v) - P_{\\mathrm{coex}}\\bigr)\\,dv = 0$$\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific EOS provided:\n$$P(v) = P_{m} + a(v - v_{m}) + b(v - v_{m})^3$$\nwhere $P_m$, $v_m$, $a$, and $b$ are constants. This EOS exhibits a particular symmetry. Let us define a shifted molar volume $\\delta v = v - v_m$ and a shifted pressure $p(\\delta v) = P(v) - P_m$. The EOS becomes:\n$$p(\\delta v) = a(\\delta v) + b(\\delta v)^3$$\nThis function $p(\\delta v)$ is an odd function of $\\delta v$, since $p(-\\delta v) = a(-\\delta v) + b(-\\delta v)^3 = -(a(\\delta v) + b(\\delta v)^3) = -p(\\delta v)$.\n\nThe coexistence volumes $v_1$ and $v_2$ must satisfy $P(v_1) = P(v_2) = P_{\\mathrm{coex}}$. In terms of the shifted variables, let $\\delta v_1 = v_1 - v_m$ and $\\delta v_2 = v_2 - v_m$. The conditions are:\n$P_m + p(\\delta v_1) = P_m + p(\\delta v_2) = P_{\\mathrm{coex}}$, which implies $p(\\delta v_1) = p(\\delta v_2)$.\nFor an odd function like $p(\\delta v)$ (and assuming we are in the region with three real roots for a given pressure, which is the case for a van der Waals-like loop), the equality $p(\\delta v_1) = p(\\delta v_2)$ for $\\delta v_1 \\neq \\delta v_2$ requires a symmetric relationship. Specifically, we will show that $\\delta v_1 = -\\delta v_2$.\nThe condition $p(\\delta v_1) = p(\\delta v_2)$ gives:\n$a(\\delta v_1) + b(\\delta v_1)^3 = a(\\delta v_2) + b(\\delta v_2)^3$\n$a(\\delta v_1 - \\delta v_2) + b(\\delta v_1^3 - \\delta v_2^3) = 0$\nSince $v_1 \\neq v_2$, we have $\\delta v_1 \\neq \\delta v_2$, so we can divide by $(\\delta v_1 - \\delta v_2)$:\n$a + b(\\delta v_1^2 + \\delta v_1 \\delta v_2 + \\delta v_2^2) = 0$.\n\nNow we consider the Maxwell integral condition:\n$$\\int_{v_1}^{v_2} \\bigl(P(v) - P_{\\mathrm{coex}}\\bigr)\\,dv = 0$$\nLet's substitute $P(v) = P_m + p(\\delta v)$ and $P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = P_m + p(\\delta v_1)$. The integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{\\delta v_1}^{\\delta v_2} \\bigl( P_m + p(\\delta v) - (P_m + p(\\delta v_1)) \\bigr)\\,d(\\delta v) = 0$$\n$$\\int_{\\delta v_1}^{\\delta v_2} \\bigl( p(\\delta v) - p(\\delta v_1) \\bigr)\\,d(\\delta v) = 0$$\nLet's test the hypothesis that the symmetry of the problem implies a symmetric solution, namely $P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = P_m$.\nIf $P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = P_m$, then $p(\\delta v_1) = P_{\\mathrm{coex}} - P_m = 0$.\nSo, $a(\\delta v_1) + b(\\delta v_1)^3 = 0$, which gives $\\delta v_1(a + b(\\delta v_1)^2) = 0$.\nThe non-trivial roots for $\\delta v_1$ are $\\delta v_1^2 = -a/b$. Since the problem is set up for a phase transition, we know that $a  0$ and $b  0$, so $-a/b  0$. The two coexistence volumes are therefore given by:\n$$\\delta v_1 = -\\sqrt{-a/b} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\delta v_2 = +\\sqrt{-a/b}$$\nThis satisfies the symmetry condition $\\delta v_1 = -\\delta v_2$.\n\nNow, we must verify if this solution satisfies the Maxwell integral condition:\n$$\\int_{-\\sqrt{-a/b}}^{+\\sqrt{-a/b}} ( P(v) - P_m )\\,dv = \\int_{-\\sqrt{-a/b}}^{+\\sqrt{-a/b}} p(\\delta v)\\,d(\\delta v) = \\int_{-\\sqrt{-a/b}}^{+\\sqrt{-a/b}} \\bigl(a(\\delta v) + b(\\delta v)^3\\bigr)\\,d(\\delta v)$$\nThe integrand $p(\\delta v) = a(\\delta v) + b(\\delta v)^3$ is an odd function. The integral of any odd function over an interval that is symmetric about the origin, such as $[-\\alpha, \\alpha]$, is identically zero.\nTherefore, the integral condition is satisfied for $P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = P_m$.\n\nThe unique coexistence pressure is thus equal to the pressure at the center of symmetry of the cubic EOS.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = P_m$$\nThe problem provides the value of $P_m$:\n$$P_m = 2.00 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{Pa}$$\nTo express this in gigapascals (GPa), we use the conversion $1\\ \\text{GPa} = 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = 2.00\\ \\text{GPa}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{coex}} = 2.000\\ \\text{GPa}$$\nThe other constants, $a$, $b$, and $v_m$, are necessary to define a physically meaningful non-monotonic isotherm, but due to the specific symmetry of the cubic model, their values are not needed to determine the coexistence pressure.",
