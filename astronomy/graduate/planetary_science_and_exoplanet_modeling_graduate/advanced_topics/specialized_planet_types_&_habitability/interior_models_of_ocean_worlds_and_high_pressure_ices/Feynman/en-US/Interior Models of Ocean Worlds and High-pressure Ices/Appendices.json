Let the sphere have radius $R$, total mass $M$, and constant density $\\rho$. Assume Newtonian gravity with gravitational constant $G$ and hydrostatic equilibrium.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the central pressure, $P_{c}$, of a self-gravitating sphere of uniform density from first principles, and then the calculation of its ratio to a provided reference pressure, $P_{c,\\mathrm{inc}}$. The model is defined by a constant density $\\rho$, total radius $R$, and total mass $M$. We begin with the fundamental equations provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the enclosed mass $m(r)$ at a radius $r$ by integrating the density. As the density $\\rho$ is constant, the integral provided, $m(r)=4\\pi\\int_{0}^{r}\\rho\\,r'^{2}\\,dr'$, simplifies to:\n$$\nm(r) = 4\\pi\\rho \\int_{0}^{r} r'^{2}\\,dr' = 4\\pi\\rho \\left[ \\frac{r'^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{r} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\rho r^{3}\n$$\nThis is the mass contained within a sphere of radius $r$.\n\nNext, we find the gravitational acceleration $g(r)$ at radius $r$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the identification and calculation of the dimensionless parameter that governs thermal convection in a sublayer of high-pressure ice, treated as a Boussinesq fluid. Before providing a solution, the problem statement is validated.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem provides a complete set of physical parameters for a clearly defined physical scenario: solid-state convection in a planetary ice layer.\nThe extracted givens are:\n- Sublayer thickness: $H = 50\\,\\mathrm{km}$\n- Temperature contrast: $\\Delta T = 50\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Density: $\\rho = 1600\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Thermal expansivity: $\\alpha = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- Thermal diffusivity: $\\kappa = 1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Dynamic viscosity: $\\eta = 1.0\\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n- Physical model: Boussinesq fluid, infinite Prandtl number limit.\n- Non-dimensionalization scales: length scale $H$ and time scale $H^{2}/\\kappa$.\n- Critical value for convection onset: $Ra_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 10^{3}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing the standard Boussinesq model for thermal convection, a cornerstone of planetary physics and geodynamics.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution, and is stated in objective, formal language. It is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe dynamics of a convecting Boussinesq fluid are described by the momentum and heat transport equations. Given the infinite Prandtl number limit, inertial forces are negligible, and the momentum balance is described by the Stokes equation, which balances pressure gradients, viscous forces, and buoyancy forces.\n\nThe momentum equation is:\n$$0 = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\rho \\mathbf{g}$$\nHere, $p$ is the dynamic pressure, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the fluid velocity, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\rho\\mathbf{g}$ is the buoyancy force. The Boussinesq approximation links density $\\rho$ to temperature $T$ via a reference density $\\rho_0$ and the thermal expansivity $\\alpha$: $\\rho = \\rho_0(1 - \\alpha(T-T_0))$. The buoyancy term can be expressed as a perturbation: $\\rho\\mathbf{g} = \\rho_0\\mathbf{g} - \\rho_0\\alpha(T - T_0)\\mathbf{g}$. The term $\\rho_0\\mathbf{g}$ is balanced by a background hydrostatic pressure gradient, leaving the thermal buoyancy force $- \\rho_0\\alpha(T - T_0)\\mathbf{g}$ to drive the flow. Let $\\mathbf{g} = -g\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ points vertically upwards. The momentum equation becomes:\n$$0 = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\rho_0 \\alpha (T-T_0) g \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$$\n\nThe heat transport equation is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) T = \\kappa \\nabla^2 T$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nWe non-dimensionalize these equations using the provided scales: length by $H$ and time by $H^2/\\kappa$. Let primed variables denote dimensionless quantities: $\\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r}/H$, $t' = t\\kappa/H^2$. The velocity scale is $U = H / (H^2/\\kappa) = \\kappa/H$, so $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u}/U = \\mathbf{u}H/\\kappa$. We scale the temperature difference by the total contrast across the layer, $\\Delta T$. Let $T' = (T - T_0)/\\Delta T$. A suitable pressure scale $\\Pi$ is derived by balancing terms. Substituting the scaled variables into the momentum equation:\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\Pi}{H}\\nabla' p' + \\eta\\frac{\\kappa}{H^3}\\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{u}' + \\rho_0 \\alpha (\\Delta T T') g \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$$\nTo make the equation dimensionless, we can multiply all terms by $H^3/(\\eta\\kappa)$:\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\Pi H^2}{\\eta\\kappa}\\nabla' p' + \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{u}' + \\frac{g\\alpha\\rho_0\\Delta T H^3}{\\kappa\\eta} T' \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$$\nBy choosing the pressure scale $\\Pi = \\eta\\kappa/H^2$, the coefficient of the pressure term becomes $1$. The dimensionless momentum equation is:\n$$0 = -\\nabla' p' + \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{u}' + Ra \\, T' \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$$\nThe dimensionless group that emerges is the Rayleigh number, $Ra$, defined as:\n$$Ra = \\frac{g\\alpha\\rho_0\\Delta T H^3}{\\kappa\\eta}$$\nThis number represents the ratio of the driving buoyancy to the dissipative viscous forces and thermal diffusion, and thus controls the onset and vigor of convection. The reference density $\\rho_0$ is taken as the provided mean density $\\rho$.\n\nApplying the same non-dimensionalization to the heat transport equation yields:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta T \\kappa}{H^2}\\frac{\\partial T'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\kappa}{H}\\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta T}{H}\\nabla' T' = \\kappa \\frac{\\Delta T}{H^2} \\nabla'^2 T'$$\nDividing by $\\kappa\\Delta T/H^2$ gives the dimensionless form, which depends on no other parameters:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T'}{\\partial t'} + \\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla' T' = \\nabla'^2 T'$$\nThis confirms that $Ra$ is the single controlling parameter for this system.\n\nWe now compute the value of $Ra$ using the given data. All parameters must be in SI units.\n$H = 50\\,\\mathrm{km} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$$Ra = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(1600\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(50\\,\\mathrm{K})(5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s})}$$\nWe calculate the numerator:\n$$N = (10)(1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(1.6 \\times 10^{3})(50)(125 \\times 10^{12})$$\n$$N = (1.6)(50)(125) \\times (10^{-3} \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{12}) = 80 \\times 125 \\times 10^{12} = 10000 \\times 10^{12} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$D = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6})(1.0 \\times 10^{18}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{12}$$\nThe Rayleigh number is the ratio of these two values:\n$$Ra = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{16}}{1.0 \\times 10^{12}} = 1.0 \\times 10^4$$\nThe calculated Rayleigh number is $Ra = 10000$. The problem provides a critical value of $Ra_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 10^{3}$ for the onset of convection. Since $Ra > Ra_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the sublayer is expected to be convectively unstable.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of this parameter, rounded to three significant figures.

It requires satisfying multiple constraints, which is a standard procedure in setting up numerical simulations. The constraints are not contradictory, as a valid range for the grid spacing $\\Delta r$ can be found. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed with Solution\nThe objective is to find the minimum integer value of $N_r$ that satisfies all constraints. The number of radial cells is related to the shell thickness $H$ and the uniform grid spacing $\\Delta r$ by the equation:\n$$N_r = \\frac{H}{\\Delta r}$$\nTo minimize $N_r$, we must maximize the grid spacing $\\Delta r$.
