It presents a standard problem in introductory planetary science that can be solved using fundamental physical principles.\n\n**Part (a): Mean Density Calculation**\n\nThe mean density, denoted by $\\bar{\\rho}$, of a celestial body is defined as its total mass $M$ divided by its total volume $V$.\n$$\n\\bar{\\rho} = \\frac{M}{V}\n$$\nThe problem states that the planet can be approximated as a sphere.

The zero-pressure (uncompressed) densities, $\\rho_0$, of these materials are well-established:\n- Common silicate minerals (e.g., olivine, pyroxene) that form planetary mantles have $\\rho_0$ in the range of approximately $3.2 - 3.5\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$. Even crustal rocks like granite have $\\rho_0 \\approx 2.7\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$.\n- Iron, the primary constituent of planetary cores, has a zero-pressure density of $\\rho_{0, \\text{Fe}} \\approx 7.9\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$.\n\n$2$. **Effect of Self-Compression:** The planet has a mass of $M = 5\\,M_{\\oplus}$, which is substantial. Its own gravity will generate immense pressures in its interior, compressing the constituent materials. The relationship between pressure and density for a material is described by its Equation of State (EOS). A fundamental property of all materials with a finite bulk modulus $K$ (where $K = -V (\\partial P / \\partial V)_T = \\rho (\\partial P / \\partial \\rho)_T$) is that an increase in pressure $P$ leads to an increase in density $\\rho$. Since pressure increases with depth inside a planet, the local density at any point inside the planet will be greater than its zero-pressure density. Consequently, the mean density $\\bar{\\rho}$ of the planet as a whole must be greater than the mass-averaged zero-pressure density $\\bar{\\rho}_0$ of its constituent materials.\n$$ \\bar{\\rho} > \\bar{\\rho}_0 $$\n\n$3$. **Argument and Conclusion:** The calculated mean density for the exoplanet is $\\bar{\\rho} \\approx 1.764\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the planet has a rock-only composition. The least dense plausible bulk rocky material (silicates) has a zero-pressure density of $\\rho_0 \\gtrsim 2.7\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$. For a planet of $5\\,M_{\\oplus}$, self-compression would significantly increase its density, so its mean density $\\bar{\\rho}$ must be strictly greater than this value. If the planet also contained an iron core, its average zero-pressure density $\\bar{\\rho}_0$ would be even higher, and thus the final compressed mean density $\\bar{\\rho}$ would be higher still.\n\nWe have the following inequality:\n$$\n\\bar{\\rho}_{\\text{calculated}} \\approx 1.764\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\rho}_{\\text{expected for rock-only}} > \\rho_{0, \\text{rock}} \\gtrsim 2.7\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}\n$$\nThere is a clear contradiction. The calculated mean density of the planet ($1.764\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$) is substantially lower than even the *uncompressed* density of the least dense plausible rocky materials. Since compression can only increase density, it is physically impossible for a planet made only of rock (and/or iron) to have such a low mean density.\n\nTherefore, a rock-only composition is **not feasible**. The planet's low density indicates that it must possess a significant fraction of low-density materials. Plausible candidates include a massive water/ice layer ($\\rho_0 \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$) or, more likely for a close-in planet, a voluminous, low-mass envelope of hydrogen and helium gas. This composition is characteristic of a \"mini-Neptune\" rather than a rocky \"super-Earth\".",

This derivation begins with two fundamental laws: the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law.\n\nThe equation of hydrostatic equilibrium describes the balance of forces on a fluid element in a gravitational field. For a plane-parallel atmosphere, it is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho(z) g\n$$\nwhere $P(z)$ is the pressure at altitude $z$, $\\rho(z)$ is the atmospheric density at that altitude, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, which is assumed to be constant.\n\nThe ideal gas law relates pressure, density, and temperature:\n$$\nP = \\rho \\frac{k_B T}{m}\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $m$ is the mean molecular mass of the atmospheric constituents. For the given $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$-dominated atmosphere, $m$ is the mass of a single $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ molecule.\n\nSince the atmosphere is assumed to be isothermal, the temperature $T$ is constant.

The problem states that the absorption radius is the planet's radius $R_p$, so $A_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\pi R_p^2$. The flux at distance $a$ is $F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}(a,t) = F_{\\mathrm{XUV},\\oplus}(t)\\,\\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}}{a}\\right)^{2}$.\nThus,\n$$P_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\epsilon \\, \\pi R_p^2 \\, F_{\\mathrm{XUV},\\oplus}(t) \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}}{a}\\right)^2$$\nThe power required to overcome gravity is the mass-loss rate $\\dot{M}$ multiplied by the gravitational potential per unit mass at the escape radius, which is taken here as $R_p$. This potential is $\\Phi = \\frac{G M_p}{R_p}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{esc}} = \\dot{M} \\frac{G M_p}{R_p}$$\nEquating $P_{\\mathrm{abs}} = P_{\\mathrm{esc}}$:\n$$\\epsilon \\, \\pi R_p^2 \\, F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}(a,t) = \\dot{M} \\frac{G M_p}{R_p}$$\nSolving for the mass-loss rate $\\dot{M}(t)$:\n$$\\dot{M}(t) = \\frac{\\epsilon \\pi R_p^3 F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}(a,t)}{G M_p} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\pi R_p^3}{G M_p} \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}}{a}\\right)^2 F_{\\mathrm{XUV},\\oplus}(t)$$\nLet's define a constant prefactor $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{\\epsilon \\pi R_p^3}{G M_p} \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{AU}}{a}\\right)^2$$\nSo, $\\dot{M}(t) = C \\cdot F_{\\mathrm{XUV},\\oplus}(t)$.\n\nThe total mass lost, $\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{lost}}$, over the interval from $t=0$ to $t_{final} = 1\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$ is the time integral of $\\dot{M}(t)$:\n$$\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{lost}} = \\int_0^{t_{\\mathrm{final}}} \\dot{M}(t) \\, dt$$\nThe stellar flux model is piecewise, so the integral must be split at $t=t_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{lost}} = \\int_0^{t_{\\mathrm{sat}}} C \\cdot F_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\, dt + \\int_{t_{\\mathrm{sat}}}^{t_{\\mathrm{final}}} C \\cdot F_{\\oplus,0} \\left(\\frac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{-\\beta} \\, dt$$\nSolving the integrals:\n$$\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{lost}} = C \\cdot F_{\\mathrm{sat}} [t]_0^{t_{\\mathrm{sat}}} + C \\cdot F_{\\oplus,0} t_0^{\\beta} \\left[ \\frac{t^{1-\\beta}}{1-\\beta} \\right]_{t_{\\mathrm{sat}}}^{t_{\\mathrm{final}}}$$\n$$\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{lost}} = C \\left( F_{\\mathrm{sat}} t_{\\mathrm{sat}} + \\frac{F_{\\oplus,0} t_0^{\\beta}}{1-\\beta} \\left( t_{\\mathrm{final}}^{1-\\beta} -
