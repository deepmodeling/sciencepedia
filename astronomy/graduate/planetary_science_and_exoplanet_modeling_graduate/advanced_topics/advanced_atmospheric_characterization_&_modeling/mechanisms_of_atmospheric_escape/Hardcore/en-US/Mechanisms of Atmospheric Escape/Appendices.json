It is free of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step derivation of the target ratio $R$, followed by its numerical evaluation and interpretation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Escape Speed ($v_{\\rm esc}$)**\n\nThe escape speed is the minimum initial speed a particle must have to overcome the gravitational pull of a massive body and reach an infinite distance with zero residual velocity. We use the principle of conservation of energy.\nLet a particle of mass $m$ be at a distance $r$ from the center of a planet of mass $M_p$. Its total energy $E$ is the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and gravitational potential energy $U$:\n$$ E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GM_p m}{r} $$\nThe condition for escape is that the particle can reach $r \\to \\infty$. At this infinite distance, the potential energy is $U_\\infty = \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{GM_p m}{r}\\right) = 0$. The minimum escape condition corresponds to the particle arriving at infinity with zero kinetic energy, $K_\\infty = 0$. Thus, the total energy of a minimally escaping particle is $E = 0$.\nBy conservation of energy, the initial energy at radius $r$ must also be zero. We define the speed at this point as the escape speed, $v = v_{\\rm esc}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\rm esc}^2 - \\frac{GM_p m}{r} = 0 $$\nSolving for $v_{\\rm esc}$, we find that the particle mass $m$ cancels:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\rm esc}^2 = \\frac{GM_p}{r} $$\n$$ v_{\\rm esc}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_p}{r}} $$\nFor the exoplanet in question, the escape speed at the exobase radius $r_e$ is:\n$$ v_{\\rm esc} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_p}{r_e}} $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Most Probable Thermal Speed ($v_p$)**\n\nThe speeds of particles in a gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ are described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution. For a 3D gas, the probability distribution function $f(v)$ is given by:\n$$ f(v) = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of a gas particle and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe most probable speed, $v_p$, is the speed at which this function $f(v)$ reaches its maximum value. To find this maximum, we take the derivative of $f(v)$ with respect to $v$ and set it to zero. We can ignore the constant pre-factor, as it does not affect the location of the maximum.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dv} \\left[ v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\right] = 0 $$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$ 2v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) + v^2 \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2mv}{2k_B T}\\right) \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ 2v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) - \\frac{mv^3}{k_B T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) = 0 $$\nWe can factor out the common term $v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right)$. The non-trivial solution (where $v \\neq 0$) is found by setting the remaining term to zero:\n$$ 2 - \\frac{mv^2}{k_B T} = 0 $$\nSolving for $v$, which is now the most probable speed $v_p$:\n$$ v_p^2 = \\frac{2k_B T}{m} $$\n$$ v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_B T}{m}} $$\nFor atomic hydrogen ($m = m_{\\mathrm{H}}$) at the exobase temperature $T_e$:\n$$ v_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_B T_e}{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}} $$\n\n**3. Formation of the Ratio $R$**\n\nThe problem defines the dimensionless ratio $R$ as $v_{\\rm esc}/v_p$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$ R = \\frac{v_{\\rm esc}}{v_p} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_p}{r_e}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_B T_e}{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}}} $$\nCombining the terms under a single square root:\n$$ R = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_p}{r_e} \\cdot \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{2k_B T_e}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_p m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{r_e k_B T_e}} $$\nThis parameter, often denoted by $\\lambda$ in literature, is the Jeans parameter. It represents the ratio of the gravitational potential energy to the thermal energy of a particle at the exobase.\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation of $R$**\n\nWe now substitute the given physical parameters into the expression for $R$:\n*   $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n*   $M_p = 3.00 \\times 10^{25}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n*   $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.6735575 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n*   $r_e = 2.20 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n*   $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n*   $T_e = 8000\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term inside the square root:\n$$ GM_p m_{\\mathrm{H}} = (6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}) \\cdot (3.00 \\times 10^{25}) \\cdot (1.6735575 \\times 10^{-27}) \\approx 3.35111 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\nNext, calculate the denominator term:\n$$ r_e k_B T_e = (2.20 \\times 10^{7}) \\cdot (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\cdot (8000) \\approx 2.42994 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\nNow, compute the ratio and its square root:\n$$ R = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.35111 \\times 10^{-12}}{2.42994 \\times 10^{-12}}} = \\sqrt{1.37909...} \\approx 1.174348... $$\nRounding the final value to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ R \\approx 1.174 $$\n\n**5. Qualitative Interpretation**\nThe dimensionless ratio $R = v_{\\rm esc}/v_p \\approx 1.174$ is a critical diagnostic for the mode of atmospheric escape.\n*   **Jeans escape** is an slow, particle-by-particle evaporative process that dominates when the gas is largely gravitationally bound. This corresponds to the case where the mean thermal energy is much smaller than the gravitational potential energy, meaning $v_p \\ll v_{\\rm esc}$. This regime is typically associated with $R \\gtrsim 10$.\n*   **Hydrodynamic escape**, or \"blow-off\", is a rapid, collective outflow of the atmosphere as a fluid. It occurs when the thermal energy of the gas is comparable to or exceeds the gravitational potential energy. This implies that the thermal pressure is sufficient to overcome gravity and drive a planetary wind. This regime is characterized by a small value of $R$, typically $R \\lesssim 2$ or $3$.\n\nOur calculated value of $R \\approx 1.174$ is very small and falls squarely within the hydrodynamic escape regime. This indicates that the thermal speed of hydrogen atoms at the exobase is nearly equal to the escape speed. Under these conditions, a substantial fraction of the gas particles has sufficient energy to escape, the upper atmosphere is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and a massive outflow will occur. This result is consistent with the physical description of a close-in mini-Neptune experiencing intense stellar heating, which is the exact scenario where hydrodynamic blow-off is expected to be the dominant mass-loss mechanism.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the mass loss rate, $\\dot{M}$, for an isothermal, steady, spherically symmetric planetary wind (a Parker-type wind).

The equation has a critical point (the sonic point) where the left-hand side is zero, i.e., $v = c_s$. For the velocity gradient $\\frac{dv}{dr}$ to remain finite and non-zero at this point, the right-hand side must also be zero. Let the sonic radius be $r_c$.\nThe conditions at the sonic point are:\n$$ v(r_c) = c_s \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2c_s^2 r_c - GM_p = 0 $$\nSolving for the sonic radius gives:\n$$ r_c = \\frac{GM_p}{2c_s^2} = \\frac{GM_p m}{2k_B T} $$\n\nTo find the velocity profile of the unique transonic solution, we integrate the wind equation. We can express the wind equation as a Bernoulli-like integral.

The velocity at the base, $v_0 = v(r_0)$, is determined by the requirement that it lie on the transonic solution. Let $x = v_0^2/c_s^2$. At $r=r_0$, the equation becomes:\n$$ x - \\ln(x) = \\frac{4r_c}{r_0} + 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_c}\\right) - 3 $$\nLet the dimensionless Jeans parameter at the base be $\\lambda_0 = \\frac{GM_p}{r_0 c_s^2} = \\frac{GM_p m}{r_0 k_B T}$. We note that $\\frac{r_c}{r_0} = \\frac{GM_p/2c_s^2}{r_0} = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{2}$.\nThe right hand side, let's call it $K$, is:\n$$ K = 4\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_0}{2}\\right) + 4\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{\\lambda_0}\\right) - 3 = 2\\lambda_0 - 4\\ln(\\lambda_0) + 4\\ln(2) - 3 $$\nThe equation to solve for $x$ is $x - \\ln(x) = K$. To solve for $x$, we rearrange into a form solvable by the Lambert $W$ function, which is defined by $z = W(z) e^{W(z)}$.\n$$ \\ln(x) - x = -K \\implies \\ln(x) + (-\\ln(e^x)) = -K $$\n$$ \\ln(x/e^x) = -K \\implies x e^{-x} = e^{-K} $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ gives $(-x) e^{(-x)} = -e^{-K}$. This matches the definition of the $W$ function with argument $z = -e^{-K}$ and solution $W(z) = -x$.\n$$ -x = W(-e^{-K}) \\implies x = -W(-e^{-K}) $$\nThe argument $-e^{-K}$ is negative. For a subsonic base ($r_0  r_c$, which means $\\lambda_0  2$), the argument is in the interval $(-1/e, 0)$, where two real branches of the $W$ function exist: the principal branch $W_0(z) \\in [-1,0)$ and the lower branch $W_{-1}(z) \\in (-\\infty, -1]$.\nThe physical condition of a subsonic base is $v_0  c_s$, which means $x = v_0^2/c_s^2  1$. This requires us to choose the principal branch $W_0$, since $-W_0(-e^{-K}) \\in (0,1]$.\nThe base velocity is therefore:\n$$ v_0 = c_s \\sqrt{x} = c_s \\sqrt{-W_0(-e^{-K})} $$\nThe mass loss rate is $\\dot{M} = 4\\pi r_0^2 \\rho_0 v_0$. Substituting the expression for $v_0$:\n$$ \\dot{M} = 4\\pi r_0^2 \\rho_0 c_s \\sqrt{-W_0(-e^{-K})} $$\nTo obtain the final expression, we substitute $c_s = \\sqrt{k_B T/m}$ and the expression for $-e^{-K}$:\n$$ -e^{-K} = -\\exp\\left(-(2\\lambda_0 - 4\\ln(\\lambda_0) + 4\\ln(2) - 3)\\right) = -e^3 \\exp(-2\\lambda_0) \\exp(4\\ln(\\lambda_0)) \\exp(-4\\ln(2)) $$\n$$ -e^{-K} = -e^3 \\exp(-2\\lambda_0) \\lambda_0^4 \\frac{1}{16} = -\\frac{e^3}{16} \\lambda_0^4 \\exp(-2\\lambda_0) $$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_0 = \\frac{GM_p m}{k_B T r_0}$ gives the final expression for the mass loss rate.\n\nThe dependence of $\\dot{M}$ on $M_p$ arises from two interrelated effects, both stemming from the sonic-point regularity condition.\nFirst, the sonic radius $r_c = GM_p/(2c_s^2)$ is directly proportional to $M_p$. The mass loss rate can be expressed as $\\dot{M} = 4\\pi r_c^2 \\rho_c c_s$, where $\\rho_c$ is the density at the sonic point. This introduces a polynomial dependence on planet mass, $\\dot{M} \\propto M_p^2$.\nSecond, the subsonic part of the wind ($rr_c$) behaves like a quasi-hydrostatic atmosphere. The density must decrease significantly for the gas to climb out of the planet's gravitational well to reach the sonic point. This introduces an exponential dependence. For a deeply bound atmosphere ($\\lambda_0 \\gg 1$), the density at the sonic point is approximately $\\rho_c \\approx \\rho_0 \\exp(2-\\lambda_0)$. The term $\\exp(-\\lambda_0) = \\exp(-GM_p m / (k_B T r_0))$ shows that $\\rho_c$, and thus $\\dot{M}$, depends exponentially and very sensitively on $M_p$. A more massive planet creates a deeper potential well, leading to an exponentially lower density at the sonic point and an exponentially smaller mass loss rate. This exponential suppression is the dominant effect for gravitationally bound atmospheres. The full solution involving the Lambert $W$ function captures this behavior exactly.",

            "solution": "The user has requested the computation of a dimensionless ratio $\\Xi$ that compares the rate of enthalpy advection in a planetary outflow to the total absorbed stellar XUV power. The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All conditions for validity are met, as the problem is based on established principles of atmospheric escape, provides all necessary data and definitions, and is framed in precise, objective language. The calculation proceeds as follows.\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $\\Xi$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Xi \\equiv \\frac{\\dot{M} \\, h(T_{b})}{\\eta \\, \\pi \\, R_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{2} \\, F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}}\n$$\nThe numerator, $\\dot{M} \\, h(T_{b})$, represents the rate at which enthalpy is advected by the outflow at its base, where the temperature is $T_{b}$. The denominator, $\\eta \\, \\pi \\, R_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{2} \\, F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}$, represents the total XUV power absorbed by the atmosphere, which drives the outflow.\n\nFirst, we must determine the expression for the specific enthalpy per unit mass, $h(T_b)$. The problem states that the outflow is predominantly atomic hydrogen, which can be treated as a monatomic ideal gas. For a monatomic ideal gas, the adiabatic index is $\\gamma = 5/3$, as given. The specific enthalpy $h$ is the sum of the specific internal energy $u$ and the specific pressure-volume product $Pv = P/\\rho$, where $P$ is pressure and $\\rho$ is mass density.\n$$\nh = u + \\frac{P}{\\rho}\n$$\nFor a monatomic ideal gas, the specific internal energy per unit mass is given by:\n$$\nu = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{H}}\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight, and $m_H$ is the mass of a hydrogen atom.\nThe ideal gas law relates pressure, density, and temperature:\n$$\nP = \\rho \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{H}}\n$$\nThis gives the term $P/\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{P}{\\rho} = \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{H}}\n$$\nCombining these, the specific enthalpy is:\n$$\nh(T) = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{H}} + \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{H}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{H}}\n$$\nAlternatively, using the adiabatic index $\\gamma$, the specific heat capacity at constant pressure is $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\frac{k_B}{\\mu m_H}$, and $h(T) = c_p T$. For $\\gamma = 5/3$, the prefactor is $\\frac{5/3}{5/3 - 1} = \\frac{5/3}{2/3} = 5/2$, confirming the result.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $h(T_b)$ into the definition of $\\Xi$:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\frac{\\dot{M} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\frac{k_{B} T_{b}}{\\mu m_{H}} \\right)}{\\eta \\, \\pi \\, R_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{2} \\, F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}} = \\frac{5 \\dot{M} k_{B} T_{b}}{2 \\eta \\pi \\mu m_{H} R_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{2} F_{\\mathrm{XUV}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\dot{M} = 1.00 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{kg \\, s^{-1}}$\n- $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J \\, K^{-1}}$\n- $T_{b} = 8000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\eta = 0.20$\n- $\\mu = 1.0$\n- $m_{H} = 1.6735575 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- $R_{\\mathrm{abs}} = 1.20 \\, R_{p} = 1.20 \\times (1.2742 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 1.52904 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $F_{\\mathrm{XUV}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{W \\, m^{-2}}$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rate of enthalpy advection (numerator):\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{adv}} = \\dot{M} h(T_{b}) = (1.00 \\times 10^{9}) \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23})(8000)}{(1.0)(1.6735575 \\times 10^{-27})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{adv}} \\approx (1.00 \\times 10^{9}) \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\times 6.600030 \\times 10^{7} \\right) \\approx 1.6500075 \\times 10^{17} \\ \\mathrm{W}\n$$\nNext, let's calculate the total absorbed XUV power (denominator):\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\eta \\pi R_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{2} F_{\\mathrm{XUV}} = (0.20) \\pi (1.52904 \\times 10^{7})^{2} (1.0 \\times 10^{3})\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{abs}} \\approx (0.20) \\pi (2.337964 \\times 10^{14}) (1.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\approx 1.469000 \\times 10^{17} \\ \\mathrm{W}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\Xi$:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\frac{\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{adv}}}{P_{\\mathrm{abs}}} \\approx \\frac{1.6500075 \\times 10^{17}}{1.469000 \\times 10^{17}} \\approx 1.123218\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\n\\Xi \\approx 1.123\n$$\nThis value, being greater than $1$, indicates that the enthalpy advected by the outflow is comparable to, or even slightly exceeds, the total stellar energy input assumed to drive the flow. This suggests that the energy-limited approximation, which assumes this ratio is very small, is not valid for this particular planetary system under the given conditions.",
