The concept of optical depth is central to this, determining whether the disk is transparent or opaque to its own thermal radiation.

            "problem": "A circumplanetary disk (CPD) surrounding a Jupiter-mass planet is modeled locally at a radius where the vertical structure is approximately isothermal and gas and dust are well mixed. Consider the vertical transport of radiation through the disk column at this location using the framework of radiative transfer (RT). The Rosseland mean opacity (RMO) in the temperature regime dominated by icy grains can be approximated by the law $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}=\\kappa_{0} T^{2}$ in cgs units, where $\\kappa_{0}=2 \\times 10^{-4}$, the opacity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}$ is in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$, and the temperature $T$ is in $\\mathrm{K}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of radiative transfer in astrophysical disks, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and objective in its language. The simplifying assumption of a vertically constant opacity, given the context of an \"approximately isothermal\" structure and a single specified temperature for evaluation, is a standard pedagogical simplification and does not constitute a contradiction. The problem will be solved as stated.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the vertical optical depth from the midplane to the surface of a circumplanetary disk, followed by a numerical evaluation and a qualitative assessment of the radiative transfer regime.\n\nFirst, we begin with the definition of differential optical depth, $d\\tau$, along a vertical path $z$:\n$$\nd\\tau_z = \\kappa \\rho \\, dz\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the opacity and $\\rho$ is the mass density. The vertical optical depth, which we will denote as $\\tau$, from the midplane (defined as $z=0$) to the disk's surface (at $z \\to \\infty$) is the integral of this quantity:\n$$\n\\tau = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}(z) \\rho(z) \\, dz\n$$\nHere, we use the Rosseland mean opacity, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}$, as specified. The problem states to assume that $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}$ can be treated as independent of height $z$ for the purpose of this integration. This allows us to factor $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}$ out of the integral:\n$$\n\\tau = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(z) \\, dz\n$$\nNext, we use the definition of the surface density, $\\Sigma$, which is the total mass per unit area in a column integrated through the entire disk height:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\rho(z) \\, dz\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the vertical density profile is symmetric about the midplane, which means $\\rho(z) = \\rho(-z)$. Due to this symmetry, the integral of density from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ is exactly twice the integral from $0$ to $+\\infty$:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\rho(z) \\, dz + \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} \\rho(z) \\, dz = 2 \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} \\rho(z) \\, dz\n$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the integral we need in terms of the surface density:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} \\rho(z) \\, dz = \\frac{\\Sigma}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for the optical depth $\\tau$, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$\n\\tau = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}} \\frac{\\Sigma}{2}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the vertical optical depth from the midplane to the disk surface.\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical evaluation. We are given the opacity law $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}} = \\kappa_0 T^2$, with the constant $\\kappa_0 = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\, \\mathrm{g}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{K}^{-2}$ and a temperature $T = 120 \\, \\mathrm{K}$. First, we calculate the value of the Rosseland mean opacity:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}} = (2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (120)^2 = (2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 14400 = 2.88 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\, \\mathrm{g}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we use the derived formula for $\\tau$ with the calculated $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and the given surface density $\\Sigma = 300 \\, \\mathrm{g} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{(2.88 \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\, \\mathrm{g}^{-1}) \\times (300 \\, \\mathrm{g} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^{-2})}{2}\n$$\nThe units cancel, yielding a dimensionless optical depth, as expected.\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{2.88 \\times 300}{2} = 2.88 \\times 150 = 432\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $432$ already has exactly three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we must determine the radiative transfer regime. The two primary regimes are optically thin, where $\\tau \\ll 1$, and optically thick, where $\\tau \\gg 1$. Our calculated value is $\\tau = 432$. Since $432$ is significantly greater than $1$, the disk at this location is described as being **optically thick**. In an optically thick medium, photons are absorbed and re-emitted many times as they travel, and their transport can be described by a diffusion process.",

The streaming instability is a leading mechanism that can rapidly concentrate dust and pebbles into gravitationally bound \"planetesimals,\" the building blocks of larger bodies.

Your solution must proceed from fundamental definitions and well-tested physical relations, and it must explicitly state and use units consistently. The output must be a single line containing the results for all test cases, aggregated as specified below.\n\nThe physical setup is a geometrically thin CPD in Keplerian rotation about a planet of mass $M_p$. Assume a vertically isothermal disk in hydrostatic equilibrium and apply the following foundational bases:\n\n- Newtonian gravity with gravitational constant $G$, Keplerian angular frequency $\\Omega_K(r) = \\sqrt{G M_p / r^3}$, and Keplerian orbital speed $v_K(r) = r \\, \\Omega_K(r)$.\n- Ideal gas with isothermal sound speed $c_s(r) = \\sqrt{k_B T(r) / (\\mu m_p)}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_p$ is the proton mass, and $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight.\n- Vertical hydrostatic equilibrium yields a Gaussian vertical density profile with scale height $H(r) = c_s(r) / \\Omega_K(r)$ and midplane gas density $\\rho_{g,0}(r) = \\Sigma_g(r) / \\left( \\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\, H(r) \\right)$, where $\\Sigma_g(r)$ is the gas surface density.\n- For small solids in the Epstein drag regime, the stopping time is $t_s(r,s) = \\dfrac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g,0}(r) \\, v_{\\mathrm{th}}(r)}$, where $s$ is the particle radius, $\\rho_s$ is the internal density of solids, and the mean thermal speed is $v_{\\mathrm{th}}(r) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{8}{\\pi}} \\, c_s(r)$. The Stokes number is $St(r,s) = \\Omega_K(r) \\, t_s(r,s)$.\n- In steady state with vertical turbulent diffusion parameterized by the Shakura–Sunyaev turbulent diffusivity parameter $\\alpha$, the dust scale height is $H_d(r) = H(r) \\, \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + St(r,s)}}$ and the midplane dust-to-gas density ratio is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}}(r) = \\dfrac{\\rho_{d,0}(r)}{\\rho_{g,0}(r)} = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_d(r)}{\\Sigma_g(r)} \\, \\dfrac{H(r)}{H_d(r)}$, where $\\Sigma_d(r)$ is the dust surface density. Define the local metallicity as $Z(r) \\equiv \\Sigma_d(r)/\\Sigma_g(r)$.\n\nAdopt the widely used thresholds for triggering streaming instability in protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks:\n\n- The aerodynamic coupling must be within a favorable window: $St_{\\min} \\le St(r,s) \\le St_{\\max}$ with $St_{\\min} = 10^{-2}$ and $St_{\\max} = 1$.\n- The midplane dust enrichment must be sufficient: $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}}(r) \\ge 1$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, proceed as follows:\n\n- Use a parametric CPD structure:\n  - Gas surface density profile $\\Sigma_g(r) = \\Sigma_0 \\left( \\dfrac{r}{r_0} \\right)^{-p}$.\n  - Temperature profile $T(r) = T_0 \\left( \\dfrac{r}{r_0} \\right)^{-q}$.\n- The dust surface density is parameterized by a baseline metallicity and a ring enhancement:\n  - $\\Sigma_d(r) = Z_0 \\, \\Sigma_g(r) \\left[ 1 + A \\, \\exp \\left( - \\dfrac{(r - r_{\\mathrm{ring}})^2}{2 w^2} \\right) \\right]$,\n  where $A$ is a dimensionless amplitude, $r_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ is the ring center radius, and $w$ is the ring width.\n\nYour program must:\n\n- Use the constants $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, kg^{-1} \\, s^{-2}}$, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J \\, K^{-1}}$, $m_p = 1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Use the planetary and unit constants $M_J = 1.898 \\times 10^{27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and $R_J = 7.1492 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, and set $M_p = M_J$.\n- Use mean molecular weight $\\mu = 2.34$ and solid density $\\rho_s = 1500 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}$.\n- Use the CPD parameters $r_0 = 10 R_J$, $\\Sigma_0 = 2 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-2}}$, $T_0 = 400 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, $p = 1$, and $q = 0.5$.\n- Evaluate on a uniform radial grid from $r_{\\min} = 5 R_J$ to $r_{\\max} = 100 R_J$ with $N = 50$ points.\n- Apply the Epstein regime formulas consistently as stated.\n- Trigger streaming instability where both $St_{\\min} \\le St(r,s) \\le St_{\\max}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}}(r) \\ge 1$ are simultaneously satisfied.\n\nTest suite:\n\nCompute the set of radii $r$ (in meters) that satisfy the triggering criteria for each of the following four cases. In all cases use the shared parameters above and the gas and temperature profiles specified. For each case, the particle size $s$, turbulence parameter $\\alpha$, baseline metallicity $Z_0$, and ring parameters $(A, r_{\\mathrm{ring}}, w)$ are as listed:\n\n- Case $1$: $s = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, $Z_0 = 0.03$, $A = 1.0$, $r_{\\mathrm{ring}} = 50 R_J$, $w = 5 R_J$.\n- Case $2$: $s = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$, $Z_0 = 0.05$, $A = 0.0$, $r_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ arbitrary, $w$ arbitrary.\n- Case $3$: $s = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$, $Z_0 = 0.04$, $A = 0.0$, $r_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ arbitrary, $w$ arbitrary.\n- Case $4$: $s = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, $Z_0 = 0.04$, $A = 0.0$, $r_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ arbitrary, $w$ arbitrary.\n\nRequired final output format:\n\n- For each case, produce the list of all radii on the grid that meet the triggering criteria. Each list must contain radii expressed in meters and rounded to the nearest $10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Aggregate the four lists into a single line in the exact format: a comma-separated list of the four case lists, enclosed in square brackets, for example, $\\left[ [r_{1,1}, r_{1,2}, \\dots], [ \\dots ], [ \\dots ], [ \\dots ] \\right]$, with no additional text.\n- If no radius satisfies the criteria in a given case, output an empty list $[ \\ ]$ for that case.\n\nAngles do not appear in this problem. All physical quantities must be expressed in SI base units. The final printed radii must be in meters, rounded to the nearest $10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, as specified.\n\nYour program must implement the physics from the stated base definitions and compute the results for all four cases. The program must not require user input and must print a single line in the exact required format. The answers are lists of floats or integers (the rounded radii), making them directly testable.",
            "solution": "We begin from the fundamental physics of a circumplanetary disk (CPD) in Keplerian rotation. The gravitational parameter is $G$, and the planet mass is $M_p$, so the Keplerian angular frequency at cylindrical radius $r$ is $\\Omega_K(r) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{G M_p}{r^3}}$. Keplerian speed is $v_K(r) = r \\, \\Omega_K(r)$. Under the ideal gas assumption, the isothermal sound speed is $c_s(r) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{k_B T(r)}{\\mu m_p}}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_p$ is the proton mass, and $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight (dimensionless). In vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, the density is Gaussian in $z$ with scale height $H(r) = \\dfrac{c_s(r)}{\\Omega_K(r)}$, and the midplane gas density is $\\rho_{g,0}(r) = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_g(r)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\, H(r)}$.\n\nWe parameterize the gas surface density and temperature as power laws:\n$\\Sigma_g(r) = \\Sigma_0 \\left( \\dfrac{r}{r_0} \\right)^{-p}$ and $T(r) = T_0 \\left( \\dfrac{r}{r_0} \\right)^{-q}$, with given constants $\\Sigma_0$, $T_0$, $p$, $q$, and $r_0$.\n\nFor small solid particles in the Epstein regime, the stopping time is derived from the drag force proportional to the relative velocity and the mean thermal speed of gas molecules. The thermal speed is $v_{\\mathrm{th}}(r) = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{8}{\\pi}} \\, c_s(r)$. The stopping time is\n$t_s(r,s) = \\dfrac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g,0}(r) \\, v_{\\mathrm{th}}(r)}$,\nwhere $\\rho_s$ is the internal density of the solid and $s$ is its radius. The dimensionless Stokes number is the product of orbital frequency and stopping time:\n$St(r,s) = \\Omega_K(r) \\, t_s(r,s)$.\n\nWe next relate midplane dust enrichment to disk turbulence. In steady state with turbulent diffusion characterized by the Shakura–Sunyaev parameter $\\alpha$, the dust scale height is $H_d(r) = H(r) \\, \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + St(r,s)}}$. The midplane dust-to-gas density ratio equals the ratio of surface densities scaled by the ratio of scale heights (for Gaussian vertical distributions):\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}}(r) = \\dfrac{\\rho_{d,0}(r)}{\\rho_{g,0}(r)} = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_d(r)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\, H_d(r)} \\Big/ \\dfrac{\\Sigma_g(r)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\, H(r)} = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_d(r)}{\\Sigma_g(r)} \\, \\dfrac{H(r)}{H_d(r)} = Z(r) \\, \\sqrt{1 + \\dfrac{St(r,s)}{\\alpha}}$,\nwhere we used $H/H_d = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\alpha + St}{\\alpha}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\dfrac{St}{\\alpha}}$, and $Z(r) = \\Sigma_d(r)/\\Sigma_g(r)$ is the local metallicity.\n\nThe widely used necessary conditions for triggering the streaming instability include:\n- An aerodynamic coupling within a favorable band, typically $St_{\\min} \\le St(r,s) \\le St_{\\max}$, with $St_{\\min} = 10^{-2}$ and $St_{\\max} = 1$.\n- A sufficiently large midplane dust-to-gas density ratio, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}}(r) \\ge 1$.\n\nGiven a parametric metallicity profile for dust that includes an enhancement ring\n$\\Sigma_d(r) = Z_0 \\, \\Sigma_g(r) \\, \\left[ 1 + A \\, \\exp \\left( - \\dfrac{(r - r_{\\mathrm{ring}})^2}{2w^2} \\right) \\right]$,\nwe have $Z(r) = Z_0 \\, \\left[ 1 + A \\, \\exp \\left( - \\dfrac{(r - r_{\\mathrm{ring}})^2}{2w^2} \\right) \\right]$.\n\nAlgorithmic procedure:\n1. Define constants in SI: $G$, $k_B$, $m_p$, $M_J$, $R_J$, and adopt $M_p = M_J$, mean molecular weight $\\mu$, and solid density $\\rho_s$.\n2. Construct the radial grid with $N$ points uniformly spanning $r_{\\min}$ to $r_{\\max}$.\n3. For each radius $r$:\n   - Compute $T(r)$ and $c_s(r)$.\n   - Compute $\\Omega_K(r)$ and $H(r)$.\n   - Compute $\\Sigma_g(r)$ and $\\rho_{g,0}(r)$.\n   - Compute $v_{\\mathrm{th}}(r)$, then $t_s(r,s)$, and $St(r,s)$.\n   - Compute $Z(r)$ from the dust parameterization and then $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}}(r) = Z(r) \\, \\sqrt{1 + \\dfrac{St(r,s)}{\\alpha}}$.\n4. Apply the streaming instability criteria $St_{\\min} \\le St \\le St_{\\max}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mid}} \\ge 1$. Collect all radii $r$ that satisfy both.\n5. Round each selected radius to the nearest $10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n6. Repeat steps for each test case with its parameters. Return the four lists in a single-line aggregate format.\n\nNotably, by substituting $\\rho_{g,0}(r) = \\dfrac{\\Sigma_g(r)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}H(r)}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\propto c_s$ into $t_s$, one finds $St(r,s) = \\Omega_K \\, \\dfrac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g,0} v_{\\mathrm{th}}} \\propto \\dfrac{\\rho_s s}{\\Sigma_g(r)}$, which shows that, within the Epstein regime for vertically isothermal disks, $St$ primarily depends on $s$ and $\\Sigma_g(r)$ and not explicitly on $T(r)$, reinforcing physical intuition and providing a consistency check for the implementation.\n\nWe now apply this algorithm to the four specified cases with shared CPD parameters $r_0 = 10 R_J$, $\\Sigma_0 = 2 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-2}}$, $T_0 = 400 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, $p = 1$, $q = 0.5$, $M_p = M_J$, radial bounds $r_{\\min} = 5 R_J$, $r_{\\max} = 100 R_J$, and $N = 50$. The case parameters are:\n- Case $1$: $s = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, $Z_0 = 0.03$, $A = 1.0$, $r_{\\mathrm{ring}} = 50 R_J$, $w = 5 R_J$.\n- Case $2$: $s = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$, $Z_0 = 0.05$, $A = 0.0$.\n- Case $3$: $s = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$, $Z_0 = 0.04$, $A = 0.0$.\n- Case $4$: $s = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\alpha = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, $Z_0 = 0.04$, $A = 0.0$.\n\nThe final program computes and prints the lists of rounded radii in meters for each case, aggregated into a single line, for direct evaluation. The units are strictly SI, and radii are reported in meters rounded to the nearest $10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.",
