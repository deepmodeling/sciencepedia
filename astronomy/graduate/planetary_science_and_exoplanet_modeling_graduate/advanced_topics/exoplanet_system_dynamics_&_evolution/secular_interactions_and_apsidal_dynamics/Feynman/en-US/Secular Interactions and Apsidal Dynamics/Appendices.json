The gravitational constant is set to $G = 4\\pi^2$ in the system of units where mass is in solar masses ($M_\\odot$), distance is in astronomical units (AU), and time is in years (yr). This choice simplifies Kepler's Third Law.\n\nThe procedure begins by processing each test case's parameters: the stellar mass $M_\\star$, the planet masses $m_i$, and their semi-major axes $a_i$. From these, we calculate a set of fundamental quantities. The mean motion for each planet, $n_i$, is computed using the formula $n_i = \\sqrt{G(M_\\star + m_i)/a_i^3}$. The orbital-separation ratios, $\\alpha_{ij} = \\min(a_i, a_j) / \\max(a_i, a_j)$ for $i \\neq j$, are also calculated. These ratios are always less than $1$ and serve as the arguments for the Laplace coefficients.\n\nThe elements of the interaction matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are functions of the Laplace coefficients $b_{s}^{(m)}(\\alpha)$. As per the problem, these coefficients are defined by an integral, $b_s^{(m)}(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\cos(m\\psi)}{(1-2\\alpha\\cos\\psi+\\alpha^2)^s} d\\psi$. We implement a function to numerically evaluate this integral for $s=3/2$ and $m \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, which are the orders required for the eccentricity evolution problem. This is achieved using a high-precision adaptive quadrature routine, `scipy.integrate.quad`, which is well-suited for the smooth, periodic integrand. The necessary coefficients, $b_{3/2}^{(1)}(\\alpha_{ij})$ and $b_{3/2}^{(2)}(\\alpha_{ij})$, are computed and stored for each unique $\\alpha_{ij}$ value.\n\nWith the mean motions and Laplace coefficients determined, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is constructed. The diagonal elements, $A_{ii} = \\frac{n_i}{4} \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{m_j}{M_\\star + m_i} \\alpha_{ij} b_{3/2}^{(1)}(\\alpha_{ij})$, represent the precession rate of planet $i$'s orbit due to the averaged influence of all other planets.

The `numpy.linalg.eig` function is employed to compute the eigenvalues $g_k$ (the secular eigenfrequencies) and the right eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_k$ (the secular eigenmodes). The problem specifies that the modes should be sorted by ascending eigenfrequency, so the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors are reordered accordingly. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are guaranteed to be real, a consequence of the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the problem, ensuring a stable, non-runaway evolution of eccentricities.\n\nThe initial state of the system is captured by the complex eccentricity vector $\\mathbf{z}(0)$, constructed from the initial eccentricities $e_i(0)$ and longitudes of periapsis $\\varpi_i(0)$. The propagation of the solution to a time $T$ is performed in the basis of the eigenvectors. First, the initial state vector $\\mathbf{z}(0)$ is decomposed into the eigenbasis by solving the linear system $\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{z}(0)$ for the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$, where $\\mathbf{V}$ is the matrix whose columns are the sorted eigenvectors. This is numerically achieved using `numpy.linalg.solve`. The time-evolved state is then synthesized by advancing the phase of each component: $\\mathbf{z}(T) = \\sum_k c_k \\mathbf{v}_k \\exp(i g_k T)$. This summation is efficiently computed using matrix-vector products.\n\nFinally, from the propagated complex vector $\\mathbf{z}(T)$, we extract the physical orbital elements. The eccentricity of each planet at time $T$ is the magnitude of its corresponding complex eccentricity, $e_i(T) = |z_i(T)|$. The longitude of periapsis is its argument, $\\varpi_i(T) = \\arg(z_i(T))$. The angles are then normalized to lie within the specified interval $[0, 2\\pi)$ using the modulo operator. The six resulting floating-point numbers for each case, $[e_1(T), e_2(T), e_3(T), \\varpi_1(T), \\varpi_2(T), \\varpi_3(T)]$, are rounded to six decimal places and formatted into a string that precisely matches the required output structure.",
