This energy is largely dictated by the relative velocity of the colliding bodies at the moment of contact. This exercise takes you back to first principles—the conservation of mechanical energy—to derive this fundamental quantity for an idealized, yet highly instructive, scenario. By deriving the contact velocity for a parabolic encounter, you will establish a crucial baseline for impact energy and appreciate the foundational assumptions that underpin more complex hydrodynamical simulations of moon formation .",

            "problem": "Consider two self-gravitating, approximately spherical planetary bodies of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ and physical radii $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ that approach each other on a nearly radial, near-parabolic trajectory prior to a giant impact. Assume the following foundational principles and conditions hold until first contact: (i) Newton's law of universal gravitation, (ii) conservation of total mechanical energy for the isolated two-body system, (iii) the shell theorem implying that the external gravitational field of each spherical body is equivalent to that of a point mass located at its center as long as the separation exceeds the sum of the radii, (iv) negligible dissipative effects (no significant aerodynamic drag, tidal dissipation, or radiative losses) prior to contact, and (v) negligible external perturbations from a third body (for example, a host star), so that a two-body description is valid.\n\nStarting only from these principles, derive a closed-form expression for the relative speed at first contact, $v_{c}$, expressed in terms of $G$, $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$, $R_{1}$, and $R_{2}$, under the near-parabolic approach condition. Treat the relative separation at first contact as $r = R_{1} + R_{2}$ and define near-parabolic as total two-body mechanical energy being approximately zero prior to contact. Provide the expression for $v_{c}$ and explain, based on your derivation, the assumptions and limits under which this expression is applicable in the context of giant impacts and moon formation.\n\nExpress your final derived result symbolically; no numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics, is well-posed with a complete and consistent setup, and is directly relevant to the specified field of planetary science.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of conservation of total mechanical energy to the isolated two-body system, as stipulated by the problem's conditions. The total mechanical energy, $E_{\\text{total}}$, of the system is the sum of its total kinetic energy, $K$, and its gravitational potential energy, $U$.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = K + U$$\nAccording to condition (ii), this total energy is conserved throughout the approach, up until the moment of first contact.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy, $U$, for two spherical masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ separated by a distance $r$ between their centers is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation (principle i) and simplified by the shell theorem (principle iii):\n$$U(r) = - \\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{r}$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the system can be most conveniently expressed in terms of the relative motion. In an inertial frame, such as the center-of-mass frame (valid for an isolated system, per condition v), the total kinetic energy is equivalent to the kinetic energy of the relative motion. This is given by:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu v_{\\text{rel}}^{2}$$\nwhere $v_{\\text{rel}}$ is the relative speed between the two bodies and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the system, defined as:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}}$$\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system at any point in time before contact is:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu v_{\\text{rel}}^{2} - \\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{r}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the bodies approach on a \"near-parabolic\" trajectory, which is explicitly defined as the total two-body mechanical energy being approximately zero, i.e., $E_{\\text{total}} \\approx 0$. For the purpose of this derivation, we will take this to mean $E_{\\text{total}} = 0$. This condition corresponds to the bodies having zero relative velocity at an infinite initial separation.\n\nWe apply the conservation of energy by equating the energy at infinite separation (which is $0$) to the energy at the moment of first contact. At first contact, the distance between the centers of the two bodies is the sum of their physical radii, $r = R_{1} + R_{2}$. The relative speed at this moment is the contact velocity, $v_{c}$. Substituting these values into the energy equation, we have:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu v_{c}^{2} - \\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} = 0$$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for $v_{c}^{2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\mu v_{c}^{2} = \\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}$$\nNext, we substitute the definition of the reduced mass, $\\mu = \\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} \\right) v_{c}^{2} = \\frac{G m_{1} m_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}$$\nAssuming non-zero masses, we can cancel the term $m_{1} m_{2}$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{m_{1} + m_{2}} \\right) v_{c}^{2} = \\frac{G}{R_{1} + R_{2}}$$\nSolving for $v_{c}^{2}$ yields:\n$$v_{c}^{2} = 2G \\frac{m_{1} + m_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}$$\nFinally, taking the square root gives the closed-form expression for the relative speed at first contact:\n$$v_{c} = \\sqrt{2G \\frac{m_{1} + m_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}}$$\nThis result is equivalent to the escape velocity from a combined mass $M = m_{1} + m_{2}$ at a distance $r = R_{1} + R_{2}$. This is a direct consequence of the parabolic trajectory assumption, where the kinetic energy at any point must exactly balance the gravitational potential energy, resulting in zero total energy.\n\nThe assumptions and limits under which this expression is applicable are as follows:\n1.  **Parabolic Encounter ($E_{\\text{total}} = 0$)**: This assumes the two bodies have zero relative velocity at infinite separation. This condition establishes a lower bound on the impact speed. Any pre-existing relative velocity at infinity (a hyperbolic encounter, $E_{\\text{total}}  0$) would add to the final kinetic energy, resulting in a higher impact speed. The derived $v_{c}$ is often referred to as the \"mutual escape velocity\" at contact.\n2.  **Perfectly Spherical, Rigid Bodies**: The use of the $1/r$ potential via the shell theorem assumes the bodies are perfect spheres whose mass distributions are spherically symmetric. It also implicitly assumes they are rigid and do not deform under mutual tidal forces during approach. In reality, tidal deformation would occur, storing some energy and slightly modifying the potential from the simple inverse-square law, thus altering the final velocity.\n3.  **No Pre-Impact Dissipation**: The derivation assumes conservation of mechanical energy (condition iv). It neglects energy loss from effects like tidal flexing (which generates heat), atmospheric drag (if atmospheres are present), or any other dissipative process prior to physical contact. Such effects would reduce the kinetic energy and thus lower the impact speed compared to this idealized value.\n4.  **Isolated Two-Body System**: The model (condition v) ignores gravitational perturbations from other bodies, such as a host star. For impacts in a star system, the three-body problem (impactor, target, star) is more accurate. The two-body approximation is valid when the encounter is rapid and occurs over a distance much smaller than the bodies' orbital radii around the star.\n5.  **Impact Parameter**: The derived expression is for the magnitude of the relative velocity vector at contact. It holds true for any impact parameter (the perpendicular distance between the initial velocity vectors) that results in a collision, from a direct head-on impact to a grazing one. The direction of the velocity vector at contact, however, will depend on the impact parameter, which is a critical factor in determining the angular momentum of the resulting debris and the potential for forming a moon.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided data are consistent and physically realistic within the context of planetary science. The problem is a valid exercise in orbital mechanics and its application to moon formation theories. Therefore, a reasoned solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum specific angular momentum, $l_{\\min}$, required for a test particle to maintain a stable circular orbit just outside the fluid Roche limit of the proto-Earth. The condition for a stable circular orbit of a test particle of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from a central body of mass $M$ is that the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. From Newton's law of universal gravitation, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $v$ is the orbital velocity. Solving for $v$ yields:\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\n$$\nThe specific angular momentum, $l$, is the angular momentum per unit mass. For a circular orbit, the position vector $\\vec{r}$ and velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ are orthogonal, so the magnitude of the specific angular momentum is $l = |\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}| = r v$. Substituting the expression for $v$:\n$$\nl = r \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{G M r}\n$$\nThe problem states that tidal forces disrupt aggregation inside the Roche limit, $R_{L}$. Therefore, the minimum orbital radius for a stable, self-gravitating body to exist is $r = R_{L}$. The specific angular momentum corresponding to this orbit is the minimum required for material to potentially accrete into a moon, $l_{\\min}$.\n$$\nl_{\\min} = \\sqrt{G M R_{L}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a fluid, strengthless rubble-pile satellite orbiting a planet. The well-tested fluid Roche limit relation for this scenario is given by:\n$$\nR_{L} \\approx C R_{p} \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{p}}{\\rho_{s}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nwhere $R_{p}$ is the radius of the primary body (the proto-Earth), $\\rho_{p}$ is the mean density of the primary, $\\rho_{s}$ is the bulk density of the satellite material, and $C$ is a constant approximately equal to $2.44$. Substituting this expression for $R_{L}$ into our equation for $l_{\\min}$:\n$$\nl_{\\min} = \\sqrt{G M \\left( 2.44 R_{p} \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{p}}{\\rho_{s}}\\right)^{1/3} \\right)}\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the characteristic specific angular momentum, $l_{\\mathrm{can}}$, for material in a canonical giant-impact scenario. This scenario is characterized by a near-parabolic approach ($v_{\\infty} \\approx 0$) and a grazing pericenter ($r_{p} \\approx R_{p}$).\nFor an orbit under a central gravitational force, both energy and angular momentum are conserved. The specific orbital energy $\\mathcal{E}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2} v^2 - \\frac{G M}{r}\n$$\nA parabolic trajectory is defined by having a total specific energy of zero, $\\mathcal{E}=0$. This is consistent with the condition that the asymptotic speed $v_{\\infty}$ is zero. At pericenter, the closest point of approach, the velocity $v_{p}$ and position vector of magnitude $r_{p}$ are perpendicular. The specific angular momentum is thus $l_{\\mathrm{can}} = r_{p} v_{p}$.\nUsing the conservation of energy at pericenter for a parabolic orbit:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2} v_{p}^2 - \\frac{G M}{r_{p}} = 0\n$$\nSolving for the pericenter velocity $v_{p}$:\n$$\nv_{p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r_{p}}}\n$$\nNow, we can find the specific angular momentum at pericenter:\n$$\nl_{\\mathrm{can}} = r_{p} v_{p} = r_{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r_{p}}} = \\sqrt{2 G M r_{p}}\n$$\nUsing the given assumption of a grazing impact, we set the pericenter distance equal to the planet's radius, $r_{p} \\approx R_{p}$. This yields the expression for the canonical specific angular momentum:\n$$\nl_{\\mathrm{can}} = \\sqrt{2 G M R_{p}}\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the ratio $l_{\\min}/l_{\\mathrm{can}}$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\min}}{l_{\\mathrm{can}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{G M \\left( 2.44 R_{p} \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{p}}{\\rho_{s}}\\right)^{1/3} \\right)}}{\\sqrt{2 G M R_{p}}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling the common terms $\\sqrt{G M R_{p}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\min}}{l_{\\mathrm{can}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.44 \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{p}}{\\rho_{s}}\\right)^{1/3}}{2}} = \\sqrt{1.22 \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{p}}{\\rho_{s}}\\right)^{1/3}}\n$$\nThis final expression depends only on the densities of the planet and the satellite material and the constant factor from the Roche limit formula. We now substitute the given numerical values: $\\rho_{p} = 5510 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$ and $\\rho_{s} = 3300 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{p}}{\\rho_{s}} = \\frac{5510}{3300} \\approx 1.669697\n$$\nNow we compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\min}}{l_{\\mathrm{can}}} = \\sqrt{1.22 \\left( \\frac{5510}{3300} \\right)^{1/3}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.22 \\times (1.669697)^{1/3}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\min}}{l_{\\mathrm{can}}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.22 \\times 1.186350} \\approx \\sqrt{1.447347} \\approx 1.203057\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{l_{\\min}}{l_{\\mathrm{can}}} \\approx 1.203\n$$\nThe fact that this ratio is greater than $1$ signifies that a canonical grazing impact imparts sufficient angular momentum to place ejecta into an orbit beyond the Roche limit, which is a necessary condition for that material to coalesce and form a moon.",
