This exercise guides you through the foundational task of deriving the relationship between a planet's total radius and the mass of its gaseous envelope. By applying the principles of hydrostatic equilibrium and an ideal gas equation of state to a simple two-layer model, you will build a mathematical description of how the observable size of a sub-Neptune is determined by the properties of its core and its thin, overlying atmosphere . This derivation is a cornerstone of planetary modeling, providing the essential link between a planet's composition and its physical dimensions.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-layer sub-Neptune planet relevant to the core-powered mass loss scenario: an inert rocky core of mass $M_{c}$ and radius $R_{c}$ overlain by an isothermal Hydrogen/Helium ($\\text{H/He}$) envelope. The envelope has mass $M_{\\mathrm{env}}$ equal to a specified fraction $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ of the core mass, so $M_{\\mathrm{env}} = f_{\\mathrm{env}} M_{c}$, and its temperature $T$ is uniform and set by the planet’s equilibrium with its host star. Assume the envelope obeys the ideal-gas equation of state (EOS), with $P(r) = \\rho(r) k_{B} T / (\\mu m_{p})$, where $P$ is pressure, $\\rho$ is density, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\mu$ is the mean molecular weight in units of the proton mass $m_{p}$, and $r$ is the radial coordinate. Assume hydrostatic equilibrium $dP/dr = -\\rho(r) g(r)$ and neglect envelope self-gravity so that $g(r) = G M_{c} / r^{2}$, with $G$ the Newtonian gravitational constant. Let the outer boundary of the envelope define the planetary radius $R$, with the photospheric pressure determined by the Eddington approximation $P(R) = (2/3)\\, g(R)/\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is a constant Rosseland mean opacity.

            "solution": "The derivation proceeds from the fundamental equations of atmospheric structure. The governing equation is that of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\rho(r) g(r)\n$$\nwhere $P(r)$ is the pressure, $\\rho(r)$ is the density, and $g(r)$ is the gravitational acceleration at a radial distance $r$. We are given the ideal gas law, which we can rearrange to express density in terms of pressure:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\frac{P(r) \\mu m_{p}}{k_{B} T}\n$$\nWe are also given that the gravitational acceleration is dominated by the core, so $g(r) = G M_{c} / r^{2}$. Substituting these into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium yields a first-order differential equation for the pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = -P(r) \\frac{\\mu m_{p}}{k_{B} T} \\frac{G M_{c}}{r^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we should work in the thin-envelope limit, where the envelope thickness is much smaller than the core radius, $R - R_{c} \\ll R_{c}$. In this limit, it is appropriate to approximate the radial coordinate $r$ within the envelope as the constant core radius $R_{c}$ in terms that vary slowly with radius. Thus, we approximate the gravitational acceleration as being constant throughout the envelope:\n$$\ng(r) \\approx g(R_{c}) = \\frac{G M_{c}}{R_{c}^{2}}\n$$\nWith this approximation, the differential equation for pressure simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{P} = -\\left( \\frac{\\mu m_{p} g(R_{c})}{k_{B} T} \\right) dr = -\\frac{dr}{H}\n$$\nHere, we have defined the constant pressure scale height $H$ as:\n$$\nH = \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu m_{p} g(R_{c})} = \\frac{k_{B} T R_{c}^{2}}{G M_{c} \\mu m_{p}}\n$$\nWe can integrate the simplified differential equation from a radius $r$ within the envelope to the planet's outer radius $R$:\n$$\n\\int_{P(r)}^{P(R)} \\frac{dP'}{P'} = -\\frac{1}{H} \\int_{r}^{R} dr' \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(R)}{P(r)}\\right) = -\\frac{R-r}{H}\n$$\nThis gives the pressure profile as a function of radius:\n$$\nP(r) = P(R) \\exp\\left(\\frac{R-r}{H}\\right)\n$$\nThe total mass of the envelope, $M_{\\mathrm{env}}$, is found by integrating its density profile from the base of the envelope at $r=R_{c}$ to its top at $r=R$:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{env}} = \\int_{R_{c}}^{R} 4\\pi r^{2} \\rho(r) dr\n$$\nUsing the ideal gas law, $\\rho(r) = P(r) \\mu m_{p} / (k_{B} T)$, and again applying the thin-envelope approximation by setting $r^{2} \\approx R_{c}^{2}$ inside the integral, we get:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{env}} \\approx 4\\pi R_{c}^{2} \\int_{R_{c}}^{R} \\frac{P(r) \\mu m_{p}}{k_{B} T} dr\n$$\nSubstituting the pressure profile $P(r)$:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{env}} \\approx 4\\pi R_{c}^{2} \\frac{\\mu m_{p}}{k_{B} T} \\int_{R_{c}}^{R} P(R) \\exp\\left(\\frac{R-r}{H}\\right) dr\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{R_{c}}^{R} \\exp\\left(\\frac{R-r}{H}\\right) dr = \\left[ -H \\exp\\left(\\frac{R-r}{H}\\right) \\right]_{R_{c}}^{R} = -H\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{R-R_{c}}{H}\\right)\\right) = H\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{R-R_{c}}{H}\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the mass equation gives:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{env}} \\approx 4\\pi R_{c}^{2} \\frac{\\mu m_{p} P(R)}{k_{B} T} H \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{R-R_{c}}{H}\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nFrom the definition of the scale height, we have $\\frac{\\mu m_{p} H}{k_{B} T} = \\frac{1}{g(R_{c})} = \\frac{R_{c}^{2}}{G M_{c}}$.

In the core-powered mass-loss framework, the planet’s cooling luminosity $L(t)$ drives a hydrodynamic outflow whose temperature at the radiative–convective boundary (RCB) is set by the planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Assume the following widely used and observationally calibrated ingredients:\n\n- The equilibrium temperature scales with orbital period $P$ for a Sun-like host as $T_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ and $a \\propto P^{2/3}$ (from Kepler’s third law), hence $T_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n- The hydrodynamic mass-loss rate from the RCB is exponentially sensitive to the escape parameter $\\lambda \\equiv \\dfrac{G M}{R c_{s}^{2}}$, where $M$ and $R$ are the gravitational mass and radius at the sonic point, and $c_{s}^{2} \\propto T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for a hydrogen–helium gas with fixed mean molecular weight. This exponential sensitivity implies that the boundary between “stripped” and “retained” atmospheres is well-approximated by a contour of constant $\\lambda$ over the timescale on which $L(t)$ supplies work to the outflow. You may take this critical escape parameter, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, to be independent of $P$ for purposes of determining the radius–period scaling of the atmospheric-loss boundary.\n- Along the valley in radius–period space, the planets have been stripped to bare rocky cores, so the planetary radius at the valley equals the rocky core radius $R_{c}$.

The escape parameter $\\lambda$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{G M}{R c_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ and $R$ are the planet's mass and radius (evaluated at the sonic point, which is proportional to the overall planetary radius), and $c_s$ is the sound speed at the base of the outflow.\n\nFor planets located in the valley, they have been stripped of their atmospheres. Thus, their mass is their core mass, $M = M_c$, and their radius is their core radius, $R = R_c$. The valley's location in radius-period space is therefore described by the condition:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{G M_{c}}{R_{c} c_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nSince $G$ is a universal constant and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is assumed to be constant along the valley, we can express this relationship as a proportionality:\n$$\n\\frac{M_{c}}{R_{c} c_{s}^{2}} \\propto \\text{constant} \\implies M_{c} \\propto R_{c} c_{s}^{2}\n$$\nThe problem provides the scaling for the sound speed. For a gas of fixed mean molecular weight, the sound speed squared is proportional to the temperature, $c_{s}^{2} \\propto T_{\\mathrm{RCB}}$, where $T_{\\mathrm{RCB}}$ is the temperature at the radiative-convective boundary. This temperature is set by the planet's equilibrium temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Thus, we have $c_{s}^{2} \\propto T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The problem also provides the scaling of equilibrium temperature with orbital period $P$ for a Sun-like star:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\propto P^{-1/3}\n$$\nCombining these, we find the dependence of the sound speed on the orbital period:\n$$\nc_{s}^{2} \\propto P^{-1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our proportionality for $M_c$:\n$$\nM_{c} \\propto R_{c} P^{-1/3}\n$$\nThis equation relates the core mass, core radius, and orbital period of planets along the radius valley.
