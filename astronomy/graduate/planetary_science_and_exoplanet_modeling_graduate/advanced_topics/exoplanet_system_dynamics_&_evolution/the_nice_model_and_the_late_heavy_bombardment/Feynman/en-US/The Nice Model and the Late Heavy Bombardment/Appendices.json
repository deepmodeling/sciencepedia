A giant planet of mass $M_{p}$ orbits the Sun of mass $M_{\\odot}$ initially on a nearly circular heliocentric orbit with semimajor axis $a$. A single planetesimal of mass $m$ initially moves on a nearly circular heliocentric orbit with semimajor axis $a_{d}$ in the planetesimal disk.

Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   System: Sun–planet–planetesimal under Newtonian gravity.\n-   Planet mass: $M_{p}$.\n-   Sun mass: $M_{\\odot}$.\n-   Planet's initial orbit: nearly circular heliocentric, semimajor axis $a$.\n-   Planetesimal mass: $m$.\n-   Planetesimal's initial orbit: nearly circular heliocentric, semimajor axis $a_{d}$.\n-   Interaction: A close gravitational encounter ejects the planetesimal.\n-   Planetesimal's final state: Marginally bound (parabolic) heliocentric escape trajectory.\n-   Planetesimal's final heliocentric orbital energy: $E=0$.\n-   Mass hierarchy: $m \\ll M_{p}$.\n-   Simplifications: Neglect Sun's recoil; encounter is instantaneous.\n-   Energy formula: Two-body orbital energy is $E=-G M_{\\odot} \\mu/(2a)$.\n-   Conservation Law: Conservation of total heliocentric angular momentum for the planet–planetesimal subsystem is to be invoked.\n-   Approximation: Planet's eccentricity change is negligible, so its angular momentum is $L_{p} \\approx M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}$.\n-   Ejection condition: The ejection is prograde, meaning the planetesimal's heliocentric angular momentum increases.\n-   Objective: Derive the sign and magnitude of the change in the planet's semimajor axis, $\\Delta a$, in terms of $m$, $M_{p}$, $a$, and $a_{d}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of celestial mechanics (Newtonian gravity, orbital energy, angular momentum) and describes a canonical process in planetary migration theories like the Nice model. All concepts are standard in astrophysics.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient initial conditions, conservation laws, and simplifying assumptions to determine a unique solution for $\\Delta a$. The assumptions, such as instantaneous encounter and negligible eccentricity change for the planet, are standard in introductory treatments of this topic and render the problem solvable.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal language devoid of any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the change in the planet's semimajor axis, $\\Delta a$, resulting from the gravitational ejection of a planetesimal. We will use the specified conservation of angular momentum for the planet-planetesimal system.\n\nLet the initial state (before the encounter) be denoted by subscript $i$ and the final state (after the encounter) by subscript $f$.\n\nThe heliocentric angular momentum of the planet, in a nearly circular orbit of semimajor axis $a$, is given as $L_{p} \\approx M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}$.\nThe planet's initial angular momentum is $L_{p, i} = M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}$.\nAfter the encounter, its semimajor axis is $a_{f} = a + \\Delta a$. Its final angular momentum is $L_{p, f} = M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} (a + \\Delta a)}$.\nThe change in the planet's angular momentum, $\\Delta L_{p} = L_{p, f} - L_{p, i}$, can be found by linearizing for a small change $\\Delta a$:\n$$ \\Delta L_{p} \\approx \\frac{dL_{p}}{da} \\Delta a = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a} \\right) \\Delta a = M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} a^{-1/2} \\right) \\Delta a $$\n$$ \\Delta L_{p} = \\frac{M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}}{2\\sqrt{a}} \\Delta a $$\n\nThe planetesimal is initially in a nearly circular orbit of semimajor axis $a_{d}$. Its initial angular momentum is $L_{m, i} = m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a_{d}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the total heliocentric angular momentum of the planet-planetesimal subsystem is conserved during the encounter.\n$$ L_{p, i} + L_{m, i} = L_{p, f} + L_{m, f} $$\nThis implies that the change in the planet's angular momentum is equal and opposite to the change in the planetesimal's angular momentum:\n$$ \\Delta L_{p} = L_{p, f} - L_{p, i} = -(L_{m, f} - L_{m, i}) = -\\Delta L_{m} $$\n\nTo proceed, we must determine the final angular momentum of the planetesimal, $L_{m, f}$. The planetesimal is ejected onto a parabolic orbit ($E=0$, eccentricity $e=1$). The encounter can be analyzed within the framework of the circular restricted three-body problem, for which the Tisserand parameter is approximately conserved. The Tisserand parameter $T$ with respect to the planet (with semimajor axis $a_{p}$) for a small body with semimajor axis $a_{m}$, eccentricity $e_{m}$, and inclination $i_m$ is:\n$$ T = \\frac{a_{p}}{a_{m}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{m}}{a_{p}}(1-e_{m}^2)} \\cos(i_{m}) $$\nWe assume the orbits are coplanar ($i_{m}=0, \\cos(i_{m})=1$) and the planet's orbit is fixed at $a_p=a$.\n\nInitially, the planetesimal has $a_{m, i} = a_{d}$ and $e_{m, i} \\approx 0$. The initial Tisserand parameter is:\n$$ T_{i} = \\frac{a}{a_{d}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{d}}{a}(1-0^2)} = \\frac{a}{a_{d}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{d}}{a}} $$\n\nFinally, the planetesimal is on a parabolic orbit, so its heliocentric energy is $E_{m,f} = 0$. Since $E_{m,f} = -G M_{\\odot} m / (2 a_{m,f})$, this implies $1/a_{m,f} = 0$. The specific angular momentum is $h_m = L_m/m = \\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a_m (1-e_m^2)}$. We can rewrite the Tisserand parameter as:\n$$ T = \\frac{a}{a_{m}} + \\frac{2 h_m}{\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}} = \\frac{a}{a_{m}} + \\frac{2 L_m}{m \\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}} $$\nFor the final state, with $1/a_{m,f} = 0$, the Tisserand parameter becomes:\n$$ T_{f} = 0 + \\frac{2 L_{m, f}}{m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}} $$\n\nBy conservation of the Tisserand parameter, $T_{i} \\approx T_{f}$:\n$$ \\frac{a}{a_{d}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{d}}{a}} = \\frac{2 L_{m, f}}{m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}} $$\nWe can solve for the final angular momentum of the planetesimal, $L_{m, f}$:\n$$ L_{m, f} = \\frac{m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a}}{2} \\left( \\frac{a}{a_{d}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{d}}{a}} \\right) = m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\left( \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2a_{d}} + \\sqrt{a_{d}} \\right) $$\n\nNow we can compute the change in the planetesimal's angular momentum, $\\Delta L_{m}$:\n$$ \\Delta L_{m} = L_{m, f} - L_{m, i} = m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\left( \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2a_{d}} + \\sqrt{a_{d}} \\right) - m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a_{d}} $$\n$$ \\Delta L_{m} = m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2a_{d}} $$\nThe problem states the ejection is prograde, meaning $\\Delta L_m > 0$. Our result is positive, consistent with this condition.\n\nFrom angular momentum conservation, $\\Delta L_{p} = -\\Delta L_{m}$:\n$$ \\Delta L_{p} = -m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2a_{d}} $$\n\nFinally, we equate our two expressions for $\\Delta L_{p}$ to solve for $\\Delta a$:\n$$ \\frac{M_{p}\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}}{2\\sqrt{a}} \\Delta a = -m\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\frac{a^{3/2}}{2a_{d}} $$\nWe cancel the common term $\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}/2$ from both sides:\n$$ \\frac{M_{p}}{\\sqrt{a}} \\Delta a = -m \\frac{a^{3/2}}{a_{d}} $$\nSolving for $\\Delta a$:\n$$ \\Delta a = -\\frac{m}{M_{p}} \\frac{a^{3/2} \\sqrt{a}}{a_{d}} = -\\frac{m}{M_{p}} \\frac{a^2}{a_{d}} $$\n\nThe result shows that the change in the planet's semimajor axis is negative, meaning the planet migrates inward. This is the expected outcome: to eject a planetesimal (giving it energy and angular momentum), the planet must lose energy and angular momentum, causing its orbit to shrink. The magnitude of the change is proportional to the mass ratio $m/M_{p}$ and the geometric factor $a^2/a_{d}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of celestial mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving the maximum impact parameter, $b_{\\max}$, for a collision. Consider a test particle of mass $m$ approaching a target body of mass $M$ and radius $R$. Far from the target, the particle's speed is $v_{\\infty}$. The trajectory is a two-body hyperbolic orbit. We use the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum.\n\nThe specific mechanical energy $\\mathcal{E}$ (energy per unit mass of the projectile) is conserved. At an infinite distance from the target ($r \\to \\infty$), the potential energy is zero, so the energy is purely kinetic:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2}v_{\\infty}^2 $$\nAt any point $(r, v)$ on the trajectory, the energy is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \\frac{GM}{r} $$\nBy conservation of energy, these two expressions must be equal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{1}{2}v_{\\infty}^2 \\quad (*)$$\n\nThe specific angular momentum $h$ (angular momentum per unit mass) is also conserved. The impact parameter $b$ is defined as the perpendicular distance between the target and the projectile's initial velocity vector at $r \\to \\infty$. The magnitude of the specific angular momentum is given by:\n$$ h = b v_{\\infty} $$\nAt the point of closest approach (pericenter), with distance $r_p$ and speed $v_p$, the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector. Thus, the angular momentum at pericenter is:\n$$ h = r_p v_p $$\nBy conservation of angular momentum:\n$$ r_p v_p = b v_{\\infty} \\quad (**) $$\n\nA collision occurs if the pericenter distance is less than or equal to the target's radius, $r_p \\le R$. The maximum impact parameter, $b_{\\max}$, corresponds to a grazing trajectory where the pericenter distance is exactly the radius of the target, $r_p = R$. For this case, equation $(**)$ becomes:\n$$ R v_p = b_{\\max} v_{\\infty} $$\nwhere $v_p$ is the speed at pericenter, $r_p = R$. We can express $v_p$ as:\n$$ v_p = \\frac{b_{\\max} v_{\\infty}}{R} $$\nNow, we apply the energy conservation equation $(*)$ at the pericenter of this grazing trajectory ($r=R$, $v=v_p$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}v_p^2 - \\frac{GM}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}v_{\\infty}^2 $$\nSolving for $v_p^2$:\n$$ v_p^2 = v_{\\infty}^2 + \\frac{2GM}{R} $$\nSubstitute the expression for $v_p$ from the angular momentum conservation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{b_{\\max} v_{\\infty}}{R}\\right)^2 = v_{\\infty}^2 + \\frac{2GM}{R} $$\n$$ \\frac{b_{\\max}^2 v_{\\infty}^2}{R^2} = v_{\\infty}^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}\\right) $$\n$$ b_{\\max}^2 = R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}\\right) $$\nThe escape speed from the surface of the target is defined as $v_{\\mathrm{esc}} = \\sqrt{2GM/R}$, so $v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2 = 2GM/R$. Substituting this into the equation for $b_{\\max}^2$:\n$$ b_{\\max}^2 = R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2}\\right) $$\nTaking the square root gives the expression for the maximum impact parameter:\n$$ b_{\\max} = R \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2}} $$\n\nThe collision cross-section, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{coll}}$, is the area of a disk of radius $b_{\\max}$ through which an incoming projectile must pass to collide with the target.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{coll}} = \\pi b_{\\max}^2 = \\pi R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2}\\right) $$\nThe purely geometric cross-section, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{geom}}$, is the physical area of the target, $\\pi R^2$. The gravitational focusing enhancement factor, $F$, is the ratio of these two cross-sections:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{coll}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{geom}}} = \\frac{\\pi R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2}\\right)}{\\pi R^2} = 1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2} $$\n\nNow, we explain how gravitational focusing modifies the impact velocity distribution. The enhancement factor $F$ depends inversely on the square of the asymptotic speed, $v_{\\infty}$. As $v_{\\infty} \\to 0$, $F \\to \\infty$. As $v_{\\infty} \\to \\infty$, $F \\to 1$. This means that the collision cross-section is significantly enlarged for slower-moving projectiles. Their trajectories are more easily bent by the target's gravity, \"funneling\" them toward the target. In contrast, faster projectiles are less affected and their cross-section is close to the geometric one. The collision rate for a population of impactors is proportional to $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{coll}} v_{\\infty}$, which in turn is proportional to $F(v_{\\infty})$. Because $F$ is much larger for small $v_{\\infty}$, the probability of collision is strongly biased towards slower impactors. If we consider the original population of LHB objects with a certain velocity distribution, the sub-population that actually impacts a given target will be skewed towards the lower end of that velocity distribution.\n\nThis bias differs between Earth and the Moon because the enhancement factor $F$ depends on the target's escape velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$. Earth's mass is much greater than the Moon's, resulting in a significantly higher escape velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{esc},\\oplus} \\approx 11.2\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ vs. $v_{\\mathrm{esc},\\leftmoon} \\approx 2.4\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$). The term $v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^2/v_{\\infty}^2$ is therefore much larger for Earth than for the Moon for any given $v_{\\infty}$. This means gravitational focusing is a much more powerful effect for Earth. The bias towards selecting low-$v_{\\infty}$ impactors is far more pronounced for Earth. For the Moon, with its low escape velocity, the enhancement factor $F_{\\leftmoon}$ is always close to $1$ for typical LHB velocities, so its impacting population's velocity distribution more closely resembles the ambient LHB velocity distribution.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the gravitational focusing enhancement factors for Earth and the Moon, $F_{\\oplus}/F_{\\leftmoon}$, given $v_{\\infty} = 14\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, $v_{\\mathrm{esc},\\oplus} = 11.186\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, and $v_{\\mathrm{esc},\\leftmoon} = 2.38\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe enhancement factor for Earth is:\n$$ F_{\\oplus} = 1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc},\\oplus}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{11.186}{14}\\right)^2 $$\nThe enhancement factor for the Moon is:\n$$ F_{\\leftmoon} = 1 + \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc},\\leftmoon}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{2.38}{14}\\right)^2 $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\oplus}}{F_{\\leftmoon}} = \\frac{1 + \\left(\\frac{11.186}{14}\\right)^2}{1 + \\left(\\frac{2.38}{14}\\right)^2} $$\nLet's compute the values:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{11.186}{14}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.799)^2 \\approx 0.638401 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{2.38}{14}\\right)^2 = (0.17)^2 = 0.0289 $$\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\oplus}}{F_{\\leftmoon}} = \\frac{1 + 0.638401}{1 + 0.0289} = \\frac{1.638401}{1.0289} \\approx 1.592372 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.592$.",

The total expected number of impacts is $\\mu_N = \\mu_w + \\mu_o$.\n\nThe joint probability of observing $k$ impacts in the window and $N-k$ in the complement is the product of two independent Poisson probabilities:\n$$\nP(k \\text{ in window, } N-k \\text{ in complement}) = P(k; \\mu_w) \\times P(N-k; \\mu_o) = \\frac{\\mu_w^k e^{-\\mu_w}}{k!} \\frac{\\mu_o^{N-k} e^{-\\mu_o}}{(N-k)!}\n$$\nThe probability of observing a total of $N$ impacts over the entire duration $T$ is:\n$$\nP(N \\text{ total}) = P(N; \\mu_N) = \\frac{\\mu_N^N e^{-\\mu_N}}{N!} = \\frac{(\\mu_w + \\mu_o)^N e^{-(\\mu_w + \\mu_o)}}{N!}\n$$\nThe conditional likelihood of observing $k$ impacts in the window, given a total of $N$ impacts, is the ratio of these probabilities:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} \\equiv P(k \\text{ in window } | N \\text{ total}) = \\frac{P(k \\text{ in window, } N-k \\text{ in complement})}{P(N \\text{ total})}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_w^k e^{-\\mu_w}}{k!} \\frac{\\mu_o^{N-k} e^{-\\mu_o}}{(N-k)!}}{\\frac{(\\mu_w + \\mu_o)^N e^{-(\\mu_w + \\mu_o)}}{N!}} = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!} \\frac{\\mu_w^k \\mu_o^{N-k}}{(\\mu_w + \\mu_o)^N}\n$$\nThis is the probability mass function for a binomial distribution $\\text{Binom}(N, p)$, where the probability of \"success\" (an impact falling in the window) is $p = \\frac{\\mu_w}{\\mu_w + \\mu_o}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}\n$$\nWe now apply this general formula to our two specific models, $M_0$ and $M_1$.\n\n**Model $M_0$ (Steady State)**\nThis model assumes a constant impact rate $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda_0$.\nThe expected number of impacts in the LHB window is $\\mu_{0,w} = \\int_{\\text{LHB window}} \\lambda_0 dt = \\lambda_0 w$.\nThe expected number of impacts in the complement is $\\mu_{0,o} = \\int_{\\text{complement}} \\lambda_0 dt = \\lambda_0 o$.\nThe \"success\" probability for model $M_0$ is:\n$$\np_0 = \\frac{\\mu_{0,w}}{\\mu_{0,w} + \\mu_{0,o}} = \\frac{\\lambda_0 w}{\\lambda_0 w + \\lambda_0 o} = \\frac{w}{w+o} = \\frac{w}{T}\n$$\nThe conditional likelihood for model $M_0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(M_0) = \\binom{N}{k} p_0^k (1-p_0)^{N-k} = \\binom{N}{k} \\left(\\frac{w}{T}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{o}{T}\\right)^{N-k}\n$$\n\n**Model $M_1$ (Transient LHB)**\nThis model assumes a piecewise constant rate: $\\lambda_H$ in the window and $\\lambda_L$ in the complement, with $\\lambda_H = f \\lambda_L$. The enhancement factor is given as $f=6$.\nThe expected number of impacts in the LHB window is $\\mu_{1,w} = \\int_{\\text{LHB window}} \\lambda_H dt = \\lambda_H w = f \\lambda_L w$.\nThe expected number of impacts in the complement is $\\mu_{1,o} = \\int_{\\text{complement}} \\lambda_L dt = \\lambda_L o$.\nThe \"success\" probability for model $M_1$ is:\n$$\np_1 = \\frac{\\mu_{1,w}}{\\mu_{1,w} + \\mu_{1,o}} = \\frac{f \\lambda_L w}{f \\lambda_L w + \\lambda_L o} = \\frac{fw}{fw+o}\n$$\nThe conditional likelihood for model $M_1$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(M_1) = \\binom{N}{k} p_1^k (1-p_1)^{N-k} = \\binom{N}{k} \\left(\\frac{fw}{fw+o}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{o}{fw+o}\\right)^{N-k}\n$$\n\n**Likelihood Ratio $K$**\nWe can now compute the desired likelihood ratio $K = \\mathcal{L}(M_1)/\\mathcal{L}(M_0)$.\n$$\nK = \\frac{\\binom{N}{k} \\left(\\frac{fw}{fw+o}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{o}{fw+o}\\right)^{N-k}}{\\binom{N}{k} \\left(\\frac{w}{T}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{o}{T}\\right)^{N-k}}\n$$\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k}$ cancels. Rearranging the terms:\n$$\nK = \\frac{(fw)^k o^{N-k}}{(fw+o)^N} \\times \\frac{T^N}{w^k o^{N-k}}\n$$\nThe terms $w^k$ and $o^{N-k}$ also cancel:\n$$\nK = \\frac{f^k}{(fw+o)^N} \\times T^N = f^k \\left(\\frac{T}{fw+o}\\right)^N\n$$\nSubstituting $T = w+o$:\n$$\nK = f^k \\left(\\frac{w+o}{fw+o}\\right)^N\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the likelihood ratio.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n$N = 22$\n$k = 11$\n$f = 6$\n$w = 0.10$ Ga\n$o = 0.50$ Ga\n$T = w+o = 0.60$ Ga\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $K$:\n$$\nK = 6^{11} \\left(\\frac{0.10 + 0.50}{6 \\times 0.10 + 0.50}\\right)^{22}\n$$\n$$\nK = 6^{11} \\left(\\frac{0.60}{0.60 + 0.50}\\right)^{22}\n$$\n$$\nK = 6^{11} \\left(\\frac{0.60}{1.10}\\right)^{22} = 6^{11} \\left(\\frac{6}{11}\\right)^{22}\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$6^{11} = 362,797,056$\n$\\left(\\frac{6}{11}\\right) \\approx 0.545454...$\n$\\left(\\frac{6}{11}\\right)^{22} \\approx 1.6166410 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$$\nK \\approx 362,797,056 \\times (1.6166410 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 586.538\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $587$.\nThe large value of $K$ indicates that the observed data are much more likely under the LHB model ($M_1$) than under the steady-state model ($M_0$), providing strong evidence in favor of a transient spike in the impact flux.",
