This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation of the RV signal induced by a single starspot on a rotating star. By working through this problem , you will build a quantitative link between the physical properties of the star and spot—such as rotation speed, limb darkening, and spot contrast—and the amplitude of the resulting spurious RV signal.",

            "problem": "Consider a rigidly rotating star observed at inclination angle $i$ (the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the line of sight), with projected equatorial rotational velocity $v \\sin i$. The unspotted stellar photosphere has specific intensity described by linear limb darkening, $I(\\mu) = I_{c}\\,[1 - u (1 - \\mu)]$, where $\\mu = \\cos \\gamma$ is the cosine of the angle $\\gamma$ between the local surface normal and the line of sight, $I_{c}$ is the disk-center intensity, and $u \\in [0,1]$ is the linear limb darkening coefficient. The disk-integrated flux of the unspotted star is $F_{\\star} = \\pi R^{2} I_{c} (1 - u/3)$, where $R$ is the stellar radius.\n\nA single, circular cool spot of small fractional projected area $f \\ll 1$ (defined such that, when the spot is at disk center, it covers fraction $f$ of the stellar disk area $\\pi R^{2}$) is located at latitude $\\ell$ on the stellar surface. The spot has contrast $\\chi \\in [0,1]$ relative to the local photosphere, meaning its specific intensity is $I_{\\text{spot}}(\\mu) = \\chi\\, I(\\mu)$ at the same $\\mu$. Assume the star's spectral lines are narrow compared to the rotational broadening, so that radial velocity (RV) is measured as the flux-weighted centroid of the rotationally broadened profile. Work in the small-spot (first-order in $f$) approximation, neglecting any changes to the stellar rotation law or line-shape other than the removal of spot flux.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be the rotational phase (stellar longitude), defined such that $\\phi = 0$ when the spot transits the central meridian. The local line-of-sight rotational velocity at the spot location is $v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi) = (v \\sin i)\\, \\cos \\ell \\, \\sin \\phi$. The spot projection factor is $\\mu(\\phi) = \\cos \\ell \\cos \\phi \\sin i + \\sin \\ell \\cos i$. Assume $i$ and $\\ell$ satisfy $i < \\ell$, so the spot remains visible for all phases (i.e., $\\mu(\\phi) > 0$ for all $\\phi$).\n\nUsing only first principles of flux-weighted RV centroids and the above intensity law, derive the closed-form analytic expression for the semi-amplitude $K_{\\text{RV}}$ of the fundamental (one-per-rotation) harmonic of the RV variation induced by the spot, as a function of $f$, $u$, $\\chi$, $\\ell$, $i$, and $v \\sin i$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is necessary. The final answer must be an exact expression.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the semi-amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the radial velocity (RV) variation induced by a single cool spot on a rotating star. We will derive this from first principles using the provided model parameters.\n\nThe total RV of a star is the flux-weighted average of the line-of-sight velocities over its visible disk. For an unspotted, rigidly rotating star, the RV is zero by symmetry. The presence of a spot, which has a different intensity than the surrounding photosphere, breaks this symmetry and induces a non-zero RV.\n\nThe observed RV, $v_{\\text{RV}}$, can be expressed as the perturbation caused by the spot. In the small-spot approximation ($f \\ll 1$), the change in RV is primarily due to the flux \"missing\" from the spot area, as the spot is darker than the photosphere. The RV induced by the spot is given by the velocity of the missing flux, weighted by the magnitude of this flux deficit, and normalized by the total flux of the immaculate star, $F_{\\star}$.\n\nThe flux deficit from the spot region at a given rotational phase $\\phi$ is $\\Delta F(\\phi)$. The spot has intensity $I_{\\text{spot}}(\\mu) = \\chi I(\\mu)$, where $I(\\mu)$ is the photospheric intensity and $\\chi$ is the spot contrast. The intensity difference is thus $I(\\mu) - I_{\\text{spot}}(\\mu) = (1-\\chi)I(\\mu)$.\nThe physical area of the spot on the stellar surface is $A_{\\text{spot}}$. The problem defines $f$ as the fractional projected area at disk center ($\\mu=1$), so $A_{\\text{spot}} = f \\pi R^2$. The projected area of the spot at phase $\\phi$ is $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{p}}(\\phi) = A_{\\text{spot}} \\mu(\\phi) = f \\pi R^2 \\mu(\\phi)$, where $\\mu(\\phi)$ is the cosine of the emission angle for the spot.\n\nFor a small spot, we can treat the intensity and velocity as constant over the spot's projected area. The flux deficit is then:\n$$ \\Delta F(\\phi) = (1-\\chi) I(\\mu(\\phi)) \\mathcal{A}_{\\text{p}}(\\phi) = (1-\\chi) I(\\mu(\\phi)) f \\pi R^2 \\mu(\\phi) $$\nThe RV perturbation is given, to first order in $f$, by:\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) \\approx - \\frac{\\Delta F(\\phi) \\cdot v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi)}{F_{\\star}} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that removing flux from a receding part of the star (positive $v_{\\text{loc}}$) causes a net blueshift (negative $v_{\\text{RV}}$), and vice-versa.\n\nWe are given the following expressions:\nLocal line-of-sight velocity at the spot: $v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi) = (v \\sin i)\\, \\cos \\ell \\, \\sin \\phi$\nLimb-darkening law: $I(\\mu) = I_{c}\\,[1 - u (1 - \\mu)] = I_c[1 - u + u\\mu]$\nTotal unspotted stellar flux: $F_{\\star} = \\pi R^{2} I_{c} (1 - u/3)$\nSpot projection factor: $\\mu(\\phi) = \\cos \\ell \\cos \\phi \\sin i + \\sin \\ell \\cos i$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi)$:\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = - \\frac{(1-\\chi) \\{I_c[1 - u + u\\mu(\\phi)]\\} \\{f \\pi R^2 \\mu(\\phi)\\} \\{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell \\sin \\phi\\}}{\\pi R^{2} I_{c} (1 - u/3)} $$\nCanceling common terms ($I_c$, $\\pi R^2$):\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = - f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\sin\\phi \\, [1 - u + u\\mu(\\phi)] \\mu(\\phi) $$\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = - f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\sin\\phi \\, [(1-u)\\mu(\\phi) + u\\mu(\\phi)^2] $$\nLet's define a constant prefactor $C$:\n$$ C = - f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} $$\nThen, $v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = C \\sin\\phi \\, [(1-u)\\mu(\\phi) + u\\mu(\\phi)^2]$.\n\nWe need to find the semi-amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of $v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi)$. This is the amplitude of the term with frequency $1$ per rotation (i.e., terms in $\\sin\\phi$ and $\\cos\\phi$). The RV variation is an odd function of $\\phi$ because it is a product of $v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi) \\propto \\sin\\phi$ (odd) and a flux term that depends on $\\mu(\\phi) \\propto \\cos\\phi$ (even). An odd function's Fourier series contains only sine terms. The fundamental harmonic is therefore of the form $b_1 \\sin\\phi$, and its semi-amplitude is $K_{\\text{RV}} = |b_1|$.\n\nThe Fourier coefficient $b_1$ is given by:\n$$ b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) \\sin\\phi \\, d\\phi $$\nThe condition $i < \\ell$ ensures the spot is always visible ($\\mu(\\phi) > 0$), so the integration range $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is correct.\n$$ b_1 = \\frac{C}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin^2\\phi \\, [(1-u)\\mu(\\phi) + u\\mu(\\phi)^2] \\, d\\phi $$\nLet's substitute $\\mu(\\phi) = A_1 \\cos\\phi + B_1$, where $A_1 = \\cos\\ell \\sin i$ and $B_1 = \\sin\\ell \\cos i$.\n$$ b_1 = \\frac{C}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin^2\\phi \\, \\left[ (1-u)(A_1 \\cos\\phi + B_1) + u(A_1 \\cos\\phi + B_1)^2 \\right] \\, d\\phi $$\nWe expand the integrand and use the following definite integrals over $[-\\pi, \\pi]$:\n$\\int \\sin^2\\phi \\, d\\phi = \\pi$\n$\\int \\sin^2\\phi \\cos\\phi \\, d\\phi = 0$\n$\\int \\sin^2\\phi \\cos^2\\phi \\, d\\phi = \\int (\\frac{\\sin(2\\phi)}{2})^2 d\\phi = \\frac{1}{4} \\int \\sin^2(2\\phi) d\\phi = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi$\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$ \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\left[ (1-u)A_1 \\sin^2\\phi\\cos\\phi + (1-u)B_1 \\sin^2\\phi + u(A_1^2 \\sin^2\\phi\\cos^2\\phi + 2A_1B_1 \\sin^2\\phi\\cos\\phi + B_1^2 \\sin^2\\phi) \\right] d\\phi $\n$= (1-u)A_1 (0) + (1-u)B_1 (\\pi) + uA_1^2 (\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + 2uA_1B_1 (0) + uB_1^2 (\\pi) $\n$= \\pi \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right] $\n\nNow we find $b_1$:\n$$ b_1 = \\frac{C}{\\pi} \\cdot \\pi \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right] = C \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right] $$\nThe semi-amplitude is $K_{\\text{RV}} = |b_1|$. The prefactor $C$ is negative since all its components are positive. The term in the brackets is non-negative since $u \\in [0,1]$, $A_1$, and $B_1$ are constructed from sines and cosines of angles in $[0, \\pi/2]$. Thus, the term is $\\ge 0$.\nSo, $K_{\\text{RV}} = -C \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right]$.\n$$ K_{\\text{RV}} = f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right] $$\nSubstituting back $A_1 = \\cos\\ell \\sin i$ and $B_1 = \\sin\\ell \\cos i$:\n$$ K_{\\text{RV}} = f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\left[ (1-u)(\\sin\\ell \\cos i) + u(\\sin\\ell \\cos i)^2 + \\frac{u}{4}(\\cos\\ell \\sin i)^2 \\right] $$\nThis can be written as the final closed-form expression:\n$$ K_{\\text{RV}} = f (1-\\chi) \\frac{v \\sin i \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\left[ (1-u)\\sin\\ell \\cos i + u\\sin^2\\ell \\cos^2 i + \\frac{u}{4}\\cos^2\\ell \\sin^2 i \\right] $$\nThis expression gives the semi-amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the spot-induced RV signal as a function of the required parameters.",

            "problem": "A solar-type star with photospheric properties closely resembling the Sun is observed to search for exoplanets using the Radial Velocity (RV) technique. The measured RV time series is contaminated by stellar activity processes that span multiple characteristic timescales.

Assume the instrument contributes negligible noise compared to stellar sources for this exercise.\n\nThe four stellar activity contributions are:\n\n1. Solar-like acoustic $p$-mode oscillations: model the dominant contribution as a narrow-band single-mode sinusoid $x_{\\mathrm{osc}}(t)=A_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\cos(2\\pi f_0 t+\\phi)$ with semi-amplitude $A_{\\mathrm{osc}}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, frequency $f_0=3.1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, and a phase $\\phi$ that is independent and uniformly distributed in $[0,2\\pi)$ across different exposures whenever the separation between exposure midpoints exceeds a few oscillation periods.\n\n2.

For the oscillations and short-timescale granulation, assume independence between exposure-averaged measurements because the separation between exposures is longer than their correlation times.

Thus, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{osc}}) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2\\,\\mathrm{sinc}^2(\\pi f_0 T)$.\n    The phases are independent between exposures, so the $E$ measurements are independent. The variance of the nightly average is reduced by a factor of $E$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{osc, night}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{osc}})}{E} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2}{2E} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\pi f_0 T)}{\\pi f_0 T} \\right)^2 $$\n    Substituting the given values: $A_{\\mathrm{osc}}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $E=4$, $T=900\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $f_0=3.1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    The argument of the sinc function is $\\pi f_0 T = \\pi (3.1\\times 10^{-3})(900) = 2.79\\pi$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{osc, night}} = \\frac{(0.5)^2}{2(4)} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(2.79\\pi)}{2.79\\pi} \\right)^2 = \\frac{0.25}{8} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(2.79\\pi)}{2.79\\pi} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.0001528\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\n\n2.  **Granulation (short-timescale, $\\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}}$)**\n    For an OU process, the variance of the time-averaged signal over a single exposure is given. Since the exposures are independent ($\\tau_{g,1}=250\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is less than the intra-night cadence), the nightly variance is this single-exposure variance divided by $E$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\frac{2\\sigma_{g,1}^2\\tau_{g,1}}{T}-\\frac{2\\sigma_{g,1}^2\\tau_{g,1}^2}{T^2}\\left(1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{g,1}}\\right)\\right)\\right] $$\n    Substituting $\\sigma_{g,1}=0.8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\tau_{g,1}=250\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $T=900\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $E=4$.

Thus, the signal is perfectly correlated across the $E=4$ exposures. Averaging does not reduce the variance. The nightly variance is simply the variance of a single time-averaged exposure.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,2, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{2\\sigma_{g,2}^2\\tau_{g,2}}{T}-\\frac{2\\sigma_{g,2}^2\\tau_{g,2}^2}{T^2}\\left(1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{g,2}}\\right)\\right) $$\n    Substituting $\\sigma_{g,2}=0.6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\tau_{g,2}=2.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $T=900\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

The true signal is a superposition of a single circular planet and stellar activity, modeled as follows. The planet has period $P_p \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{d}$ and semi-amplitude $K \\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$; its contribution can be written as $v_p(t) = K \\sin\\left(2\\pi t/P_p + \\phi\\right)$ with unknown phase $\\phi$.

Sensitivity to priors, examining the posterior for $K$ and $\\theta$.\n    3.  Residual periodograms, specifically the generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram $P_\\mathrm{LS}(P)$ of residuals after subtracting the GP posterior mean.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is an accurate and realistic description of a standard challenge in exoplanetology: disentangling a weak planetary signal from correlated stellar activity noise in radial velocity data. The use of Gaussian Processes with quasi-periodic kernels is a state-of-the-art technique. The numerical values for observation count, baseline, planet parameters, and stellar rotation period are all physically plausible for a solar-type star. The diagnostic methods described are routinely used in Bayesian statistical modeling and are particularly relevant to this field. The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of astrophysics and statistics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks to identify which set of diagnostic outcomes provides the strongest evidence for a specific, well-defined model pathology (overfitting by the GP resulting in absorption of the planetary signal). This is a well-posed question of scientific and statistical interpretation that admits a single best answer based on understanding the described model and its failure modes.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language common to the fields of statistics and physics. All models, quantities, and diagnostics are formally defined. There is no ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion-based phrasing.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, unrealism, etc.). The setup is self-contained, consistent, and represents a non-trivial but solvable problem in data analysis.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to identify the signature of an overfitting Gaussian Process (GP) activity model that incorrectly absorbs the true planetary signal, $v_p(t)$. \"Overfitting\" in this context means the GP model is too flexible and fits not just the stellar activity $a(t)$, but also the planetary signal $v_p(t)$ and potentially some of the white noise $\\epsilon_i$.\n\nLet's analyze the expected consequences of this specific failure mode on the three provided diagnostics, and how these would change when the overfitting is mitigated by a \"tightened\" prior. A tightened prior favoring larger $\\ell$ forces the GP to be smoother, making it less capable of modeling the relatively short-period, coherent sinusoidal signal from the planet.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity to Priors and the Planet Parameter $K$**:\n    - **Overfitting (Broad Prior)**: If the GP is overly flexible, its posterior mean, $\\hat{a}(t)$, will model both the true activity and the planet signal: $\\hat{a}(t) \\approx a(t) + v_p(t)$. Consequently, the Keplerian component of the model, $v_p(t)$, has nothing left to fit. The posterior probability distribution for the planet's semi-amplitude $K$ will therefore be concentrated at or near $K=0$.\n    - **Mitigated (Tightened Prior)**: When the GP is constrained to be smoother (larger $\\ell$), it can no longer fit the planetary signal. The signal $v_p(t)$ is now \"left over\" for the Keplerian component to model. As a result, the posterior for $K$ should shift away from zero to a value consistent with the true signal strength, i.e., $K \\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n    - **In summary**: A strong indicator of the GP absorbing the planet signal is a posterior for $K$ that is near zero under broad priors, but increases significantly towards the true value under tightened priors.\n\n2.  **Posterior Predictive Checks and Coverage ($C$)**:\n    - **Overfitting (Broad Prior)**: An overfitted model follows the data points too closely. This often leads to overconfidence, where the model underestimates its own uncertainty. The posterior predictive intervals $I_i^{95\\%}$ become too narrow. When intervals are narrower than the true stochasticity of the data generating process, they will fail to contain the observed data points as often as they should. Thus, the empirical coverage $C$ will drop well below the nominal level of $0.95$.\n    - **Mitigated (Tightened Prior)**: A better-specified, less flexible model will have more realistic uncertainty estimates. Its predictive intervals will be wider and better calibrated. This will cause the coverage statistic $C$ to increase towards the nominal $0.95$ value.\n    - **In summary**: Overfitting is indicated by poor coverage ($C \\ll 0.95$) under broad priors, which improves ($C \\approx 0.95$) under tightened priors.\n\n3.  **Residual Periodograms**:\n    - The problem specifies the periodogram of residuals *after subtracting the GP posterior mean*, i.e., the periodogram of $r'_i = y_i - \\hat{a}(t_i)$.\n    - **Overfitting (Broad Prior)**: As established, the GP posterior mean absorbs the planet signal, $\\hat{a}(t_i) \\approx a(t_i) + v_p(t_i)$. The residuals are then $r'_i = (v_p(t_i) + a(t_i) + \\epsilon_i) - \\hat{a}(t_i) \\approx \\epsilon_i$. The periodogram of these residuals, which are approximately white noise, will be flat and show no significant peak at the planet's period $P_p$.\n    - **Mitigated (Tightened Prior)**: With the smoother GP, the posterior mean only models the activity, $\\hat{a}(t_i) \\approx a(t_i)$. The residuals are now $r'_i = (v_p(t_i) + a(t_i) + \\epsilon_i) - \\hat{a}(t_i) \\approx v_p(t_i) + \\epsilon_i$. The periodogram of these residuals will now contain the planetary signal, exhibiting a strong, significant peak at $P_p$.\n    - **In summary**: This form of overfitting is indicated by the absence of a peak at $P_p$ in the GP-subtracted residual periodogram under broad priors, and the emergence of a clear peak at $P_p$ under tightened priors.\n\nCombining these three points, the strongest evidence for the GP overfitting and absorbing the planet signal is a composite outcome where, upon moving from a broad to a tightened prior:\n- The posterior for $K$ shifts from near-zero to a significant value.\n- The posterior predictive coverage improves from poor ($<0.95$) to nominal ($\\approx 0.95$).\n- A significant peak at $P_p$ emerges in the periodogram of the residuals $y_i - \\hat{a}(t_i)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under broad GP priors, the posterior predictive intervals are unusually narrow with $C \\approx 0.65$ (well below $0.95$), the residual periodogram has no significant peak at $P_p \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{d}$ (i.e., $P_\\mathrm{LS}(50\\,\\mathrm{d})$ is comparable to the median power), and the posterior for $K$ concentrates at $K \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. Under tightened priors favoring larger $\\ell$, the coverage improves to $C \\approx 0.93$, a clear residual peak emerges at $P_p$ (i.e., $P_\\mathrm{LS}(50\\,\\mathrm{d})$ exceeds the $1\\%$ false-alarm level), and the posterior for $K$ shifts to $K \\approx 0.9\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.**\n- This option presents a scenario that perfectly matches all three diagnostic signatures derived above. The low coverage ($C \\approx 0.65$), suppressed planet signal ($K \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$), and flat residual periodogram under broad priors all point to an overconfident, overfitted GP absorbing the planet's power. The recovery of coverage ($C \\approx 0.93$), the planet's amplitude ($K \\approx 0.9\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$), and the appearance of the planet's signal in the GP residuals under tightened priors confirm this diagnosis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under broad GP priors, the coverage is nominal $C \\approx 0.95$, and the residual periodogram shows a strong peak at $P_p \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{d}$. Tightening the priors removes the $50\\,\\mathrm{d}$ peak while the posterior for $K$ remains stable at $K \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.**\n- This scenario describes the opposite of what is expected. The broad prior model appears to be working well (nominal coverage, planet signal is left in residuals). Tightening the prior seems to cause the GP to absorb the planet signal (\"removes the $50\\,\\mathrm{d}$ peak\"), which is counter-intuitive as a smoother GP should be less able to do this. The stability of $K$ at a high value is inconsistent with the peak's removal.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under broad GP priors, the predictive intervals are very wide with $C \\approx 0.99$, the residual periodogram shows power concentrated near $P_\\mathrm{rot} \\approx 25\\,\\mathrm{d}$ but no notable feature near $P_p \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{d}$, and tightening the priors does not change these patterns while the posterior for $K$ shrinks further toward $K \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.**\n- The high coverage ($C \\approx 0.99$) indicates overly wide predictive intervals, which is a sign of an *underfitted* or overly conservative model, not an overfitted one. The model is essentially saying \"I don't know\", which is the opposite of overconfidence. The scenario describes a failure to detect the planet, not an absorption of its signal through overfitting.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under both prior choices, the posterior predictive residual autocorrelation function is consistent with whitened noise, the coverage is $C \\approx 0.94$, the residual periodogram is flat with no peaks exceeding standard false-alarm thresholds, and the posterior for $K$ is stable at $K \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.**\n- This option describes an ideal, robust analysis. The model results are stable against changes in the prior, the coverage is nominal, the residuals are white, and the planet is securely detected. This is the goal of a successful analysis, not a sign of a problem like overfitting.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Widening the GP priors increases the Bayesian model evidence by a factor of $10^6$ relative to tightened priors, but the coverage remains $C \\approx 0.95$, the residual periodogram is unchanged, and the posterior for $K$ is unchanged at $K \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.**\n- This option presents a contradiction. If the broad prior GP were overfitting and absorbing the planet signal, the posterior for $K$ would necessarily decrease. The fact that $K$ is stable at $K \\approx 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and the residuals are unchanged means the planet signal is not being absorbed. The large increase in model evidence for the more complex model without any change in the physical parameters of interest can be a subtle sign of problems, but the scenario as described is inconsistent with the specific failure mode of the GP absorbing planetary power.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion: Option A is the only one that provides a self-consistent and theoretically sound set of diagnostic outcomes for the case where a flexible GP model overfits and absorbs a planetary signal.",
