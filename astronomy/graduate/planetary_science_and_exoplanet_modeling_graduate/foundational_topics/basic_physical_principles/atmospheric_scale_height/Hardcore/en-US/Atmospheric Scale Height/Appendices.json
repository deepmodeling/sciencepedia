            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All necessary data and assumptions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical principles. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to derive the atmospheric density profile and the expression for the scale height, $H$, starting from the principles of hydrostatic equilibrium and the Ideal Gas Law.\n\nThe equation of hydrostatic equilibrium describes the balance between the upward pressure-gradient force and the downward gravitational force on a fluid element. For a parcel of gas of area $A$ and infinitesimal height $dz$ at an altitude $z$, the net force is zero. The pressure difference $dP$ over the height $dz$ results in an upward force $-A\\,dP$. The gravitational force is $dF_g = -dm\\,g = -(\\rho A\\,dz)g$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The equilibrium condition is $-A\\,dP - \\rho g A\\,dz = 0$, which simplifies to the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g\n$$\nHere, $P$ is the pressure. The negative sign indicates that pressure decreases as altitude $z$ increases.\n\nThe Ideal Gas Law relates pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of particles. It can be written as $P V = N k_B T$, where $N$ is the number of particles, $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Rearranging, we get $P = (N/V) k_B T = n k_B T$, where $n$ is the number density of particles. The mass density $\\rho$ is related to the number density $n$ by $\\rho = n \\bar{m}$, where $\\bar{m}$ is the mean mass of a gas particle. The problem defines the mean molecular weight $\\mu$ as a dimensionless quantity in units of the hydrogen atom mass, $m_H$. Thus, $\\bar{m} = \\mu m_H$. Substituting this into the density relation, we get $\\rho = n \\mu m_H$, or $n = \\rho / (\\mu m_H)$. Substituting this expression for $n$ into the Ideal Gas Law gives:\n$$\nP = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\mu m_H}\\right) k_B T\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations. We can eliminate one variable to find the atmospheric profile. To find the density profile, we first solve for the pressure profile. From the Ideal Gas Law, we can express density in terms of pressure:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{P \\mu m_H}{k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho$ into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\left(\\frac{P \\mu m_H}{k_B T}\\right) g\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables. The problem states the atmosphere is isothermal, meaning $T$ is constant. It is also assumed that $\\mu$ and $g$ are constant with altitude.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P} dP = -\\frac{\\mu m_H g}{k_B T} dz\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from a reference altitude $z_0$ (with pressure $P_0$) to an arbitrary altitude $z$ (with pressure $P(z)$):\n$$\n\\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} \\frac{dP'}{P'} = -\\int_{z_0}^{z} \\frac{\\mu m_H g}{k_B T} dz'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P(z)) - \\ln(P_0) = -\\frac{\\mu m_H g}{k_B T} (z - z_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(z)}{P_0}\\right) = -\\frac{z - z_0}{\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H g}\\right)}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the pressure profile:\n$$\nP(z) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - z_0}{\\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H g}}\\right)\n$$\nThe term in the denominator of the exponent has units of length and represents the characteristic e-folding distance for the pressure. This is the atmospheric scale height, $H$.\n$$\nH \\equiv \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H g}\n$$\nSince the atmosphere is isothermal, the Ideal Gas Law $P = \\rho \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H}$ implies that pressure is directly proportional to density, $P \\propto \\rho$. Therefore, the density profile follows the same exponential decay:\n$$\n\\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - z_0}{H}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we evaluate the scale heights for the hot Jupiter (HJ) and the super-Earth (SE) and compute their ratio.\nThe scale height for the hot Jupiter is:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = \\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}\n$$\nThe scale height for the super-Earth is:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{SE}} = \\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the two scale heights is:\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}}{\\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{SE}}}}\n$$\nThe constants $k_B$ and $m_H$ cancel, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{T_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{g_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe substitute the given values:\n$T_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = 2.3$, $g_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{SE}} = 700\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}} = 29$, $g_{\\mathrm{SE}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\left(\\frac{2000}{700}\\right) \\left(\\frac{29}{2.3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{25}{10}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\left(\\frac{20}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{290}{23}\\right) (2.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} \\approx (2.85714...) \\times (12.60869...) \\times (2.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} \\approx 90.06211...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $90.06$.\n\nFinally, regarding the implications for transmission spectra:\nThe atmospheric scale height $H$ quantifies the vertical extent of a planet's atmosphere. A larger scale height implies a more \"puffed-up\" or extended atmosphere. During a planetary transit, starlight is filtered through this atmosphere, and atomic or molecular species absorb light at specific wavelengths, creating spectral features. The amplitude of these absorption features is proportional to the total path length of starlight through the absorbing region of the atmosphere. Under the simplifying assumption that this amplitude scales linearly with $H$, our result shows that the scale height of the hot Jupiter is approximately $90$ times larger than that of the super-Earth. This implies that the transmission spectral features for the hot Jupiter would be significantly more pronounced and thus easier to detect than for the super-Earth, all other parameters being equal. This is why hot, low-gravity planets with low-mean-molecular-weight atmospheres (like hot Jupiters) are considered prime targets for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy.",

The problem is well-posed and leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Pressure Scale Height $H(z)$\n\nThe local pressure scale height, $H(z)$, is defined by the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P} \\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{H(z)}\n$$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure and $z$ is the altitude.\n\nThe problem states that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The equation for hydrostatic equilibrium is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho(z) g\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(z)$ is the atmospheric density at altitude $z$, and $g$ is the constant gravitational acceleration.\n\nSubstituting the hydrostatic equilibrium equation into the definition of scale height gives:\n$$\n\\frac{-\\rho(z) g}{P(z)} = -\\frac{1}{H(z)}\n$$\nSolving for $H(z)$, we find:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{P(z)}{\\rho(z) g}\n$$\nThe problem also assumes the atmosphere behaves as an ideal gas. The Ideal Gas Law can be written in terms of density as:\n$$\nP(z) = \\rho(z) R_{specific} T(z)\n$$\nwhere $T(z)$ is the temperature at altitude $z$ and $R_{specific}$ is the specific gas constant for the atmospheric gas. The specific gas constant is related to the universal gas constant $R_u$ and the molar mass $M$ of the gas by:\n$$\nR_{specific} = \\frac{R_u}{M}\n$$\nSubstituting the Ideal Gas Law into the expression for $H(z)$:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{\\rho(z) R_{specific} T(z)}{\\rho(z) g} = \\frac{R_{specific} T(z)}{g}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the local scale height is directly proportional to the local temperature $T(z)$. To find $H(z)$, we must first determine the temperature profile $T(z)$.\n\nThe atmosphere is described as dry and adiabatic. For an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium undergoing an adiabatic process, we can find the temperature lapse rate, $\\Gamma = -\\frac{dT}{dz}$. We start with the first law of thermodynamics in terms of specific enthalpy, $h$:\n$$\ndh = Tds + vdP\n$$\nwhere $ds$ is the change in specific entropy and $v = 1/\\rho$ is the specific volume. For an adiabatic process, $ds = 0$. So, $dh = vdP = \\frac{1}{\\rho} dP$.\nThe change in specific enthalpy is also given by $dh = c_p dT$, where $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\nEquating the two expressions for $dh$:\n$$\nc_p dT = \\frac{1}{\\rho} dP\n$$\nNow, substitute the hydrostatic equilibrium relation $dP = -\\rho g dz$:\n$$\nc_p dT = \\frac{1}{\\rho} (-\\rho g dz) = -g dz\n$$\nRearranging gives the dry adiabatic lapse rate $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = -\\frac{dT}{dz} = \\frac{g}{c_p}\n$$\nSince $g$ and $c_p$ are given as constants, the lapse rate $\\Gamma$ is constant. We can integrate this equation to find the temperature profile $T(z)$, with the boundary condition $T(z=0) = T_0$:\n$$\n\\int_{T_0}^{T(z)} dT' = \\int_{0}^{z} (-\\Gamma) dz'\n$$\n$$\nT(z) - T_0 = -\\Gamma z\n$$\n$$\nT(z) = T_0 - \\Gamma z = T_0 - \\left(\\frac{g}{c_p}\\right) z\n$$\nNow we can substitute this expression for $T(z)$ into our equation for the scale height $H(z)$:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{R_{specific}}{g} T(z) = \\frac{R_{specific}}{g} \\left( T_0 - \\frac{g}{c_p} z \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $R_{specific} = R_u/M$, we arrive at the final analytical expression for the local pressure scale height as a function of altitude:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{R_u}{Mg} \\left( T_0 - \\frac{g}{c_p} z \\right)\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation of $H(z)$\n\nFirst, we compile the numerical values of the constants in SI units:\n- $g = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $T_0 = 220\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $c_p = 850\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $R_u = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $M = 44.01\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} = 0.04401\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nNext, we calculate the specific gas constant $R_{specific}$ and the dry adiabatic lapse rate $\\Gamma$:\n$$\nR_{specific} = \\frac{R_u}{M} = \\frac{8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}{0.04401\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 188.9221226\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{g}{c_p} = \\frac{3.7\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}}{850\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} \\approx 0.00435294\\,\\mathrm{K\\,m^{-1}}\n$$\nNow we can evaluate $H(z)$ at the required altitudes.

The upward acceleration helps support the atmosphere, making it more extended (larger true scale height) than gravity alone would suggest.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $T = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\mu = 2.3$\n- $g = 10\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $a = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $m_u = 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe product $\\mu m_u = 2.3 \\times (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\approx 3.81923985 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nPlugging these into the expression for $\\Delta H$:\n$$\n\\Delta H = - \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})}{(3.81923985 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) \\times (10 - 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H = - \\frac{6.903245 \\times 10^{-21}}{(3.81923985 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (10) \\times (9.5)}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H = - \\frac{6.903245 \\times 10^{-21}}{3.62827786 \\times 10^{-25}} \\approx -19027.15\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $-19030\\,\\mathrm{m}$, which is $-1.903 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$.",
