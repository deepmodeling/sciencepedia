            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All necessary data and assumptions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical principles. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to derive the atmospheric density profile and the expression for the scale height, $H$, starting from the principles of hydrostatic equilibrium and the Ideal Gas Law.\n\nThe equation of hydrostatic equilibrium describes the balance between the upward pressure-gradient force and the downward gravitational force on a fluid element. For a parcel of gas of area $A$ and infinitesimal height $dz$ at an altitude $z$, the net force is zero. The pressure difference $dP$ over the height $dz$ results in an upward force $-A\\,dP$. The gravitational force is $dF_g = -dm\\,g = -(\\rho A\\,dz)g$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The equilibrium condition is $-A\\,dP - \\rho g A\\,dz = 0$, which simplifies to the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g\n$$\nHere, $P$ is the pressure. The negative sign indicates that pressure decreases as altitude $z$ increases.\n\nThe Ideal Gas Law relates pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of particles. It can be written as $P V = N k_B T$, where $N$ is the number of particles, $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Rearranging, we get $P = (N/V) k_B T = n k_B T$, where $n$ is the number density of particles. The mass density $\\rho$ is related to the number density $n$ by $\\rho = n \\bar{m}$, where $\\bar{m}$ is the mean mass of a gas particle. The problem defines the mean molecular weight $\\mu$ as a dimensionless quantity in units of the hydrogen atom mass, $m_H$. Thus, $\\bar{m} = \\mu m_H$. Substituting this into the density relation, we get $\\rho = n \\mu m_H$, or $n = \\rho / (\\mu m_H)$. Substituting this expression for $n$ into the Ideal Gas Law gives:\n$$\nP = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\mu m_H}\\right) k_B T\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations. We can eliminate one variable to find the atmospheric profile. To find the density profile, we first solve for the pressure profile. From the Ideal Gas Law, we can express density in terms of pressure:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{P \\mu m_H}{k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho$ into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\left(\\frac{P \\mu m_H}{k_B T}\\right) g\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables. The problem states the atmosphere is isothermal, meaning $T$ is constant. It is also assumed that $\\mu$ and $g$ are constant with altitude.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P} dP = -\\frac{\\mu m_H g}{k_B T} dz\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from a reference altitude $z_0$ (with pressure $P_0$) to an arbitrary altitude $z$ (with pressure $P(z)$):\n$$\n\\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} \\frac{dP'}{P'} = -\\int_{z_0}^{z} \\frac{\\mu m_H g}{k_B T} dz'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P(z)) - \\ln(P_0) = -\\frac{\\mu m_H g}{k_B T} (z - z_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(z)}{P_0}\\right) = -\\frac{z - z_0}{\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H g}\\right)}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the pressure profile:\n$$\nP(z) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - z_0}{\\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H g}}\\right)\n$$\nThe term in the denominator of the exponent has units of length and represents the characteristic e-folding distance for the pressure. This is the atmospheric scale height, $H$.\n$$\nH \\equiv \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H g}\n$$\nSince the atmosphere is isothermal, the Ideal Gas Law $P = \\rho \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_H}$ implies that pressure is directly proportional to density, $P \\propto \\rho$. Therefore, the density profile follows the same exponential decay:\n$$\n\\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - z_0}{H}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we evaluate the scale heights for the hot Jupiter (HJ) and the super-Earth (SE) and compute their ratio.\nThe scale height for the hot Jupiter is:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = \\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}\n$$\nThe scale height for the super-Earth is:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{SE}} = \\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the two scale heights is:\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}}{\\frac{k_B T_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}} m_H g_{\\mathrm{SE}}}}\n$$\nThe constants $k_B$ and $m_H$ cancel, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{T_{\\mathrm{SE}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{g_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe substitute the given values:\n$T_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = 2.3$, $g_{\\mathrm{HJ}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{SE}} = 700\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{SE}} = 29$, $g_{\\mathrm{SE}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\left(\\frac{2000}{700}\\right) \\left(\\frac{29}{2.3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{25}{10}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} = \\left(\\frac{20}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{290}{23}\\right) (2.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} \\approx (2.85714...) \\times (12.60869...) \\times (2.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{HJ}}}{H_{\\mathrm{SE}}} \\approx 90.06211...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $90.06$.\n\nFinally, regarding the implications for transmission spectra:\nThe atmospheric scale height $H$ quantifies the vertical extent of a planet's atmosphere. A larger scale height implies a more \"puffed-up\" or extended atmosphere. During a planetary transit, starlight is filtered through this atmosphere, and atomic or molecular species absorb light at specific wavelengths, creating spectral features. The amplitude of these absorption features is proportional to the total path length of starlight through the absorbing region of the atmosphere. Under the simplifying assumption that this amplitude scales linearly with $H$, our result shows that the scale height of the hot Jupiter is approximately $90$ times larger than that of the super-Earth. This implies that the transmission spectral features for the hot Jupiter would be significantly more pronounced and thus easier to detect than for the super-Earth, all other parameters being equal. This is why hot, low-gravity planets with low-mean-molecular-weight atmospheres (like hot Jupiters) are considered prime targets for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the atmospheric scale height $H$ and the mean molecular weight $\\mu$ from first principles, followed by a numerical calculation of $\\mu$. The derivation begins with two fundamental physical laws: the equation of hydrostatic balance and the Ideal Gas Law.\n\nFirst, we consider the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a static fluid in a uniform gravitational field. This equation states that the change in pressure $dP$ over a differential change in altitude $dz$ is balanced by the weight of the fluid element:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho(z) g\n$$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho(z)$ is the density of the atmosphere at altitude $z$, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, which is assumed to be constant. The negative sign indicates that pressure decreases with increasing altitude.\n\nNext, we use the Ideal Gas Law to relate pressure, density, and temperature. For a gas composed of particles with a mean mass $m$, the Ideal Gas Law can be written as:\n$$\nP = n k_B T\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of particles (number of particles per unit volume), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The density $\\rho$ is related to the number density $n$ and the mean particle mass $m$ by $\\rho = n m$. We can therefore express the number density as $n = \\rho/m$. Substituting this into the Ideal Gas Law gives:\n$$\nP = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{m}\\right) k_B T\n$$\nThe problem states the atmosphere is isothermal, so $T$ is constant. For a well-mixed atmosphere, the mean particle mass $m$ is also constant. We can rearrange this equation to express density in terms of pressure:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{m P}{k_B T}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for density into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = - \\left( \\frac{m P}{k_B T} \\right) g\n$$\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation for the pressure $P(z)$. We can rearrange it to separate the variables $P$ and $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{P} = -\\frac{mg}{k_B T} dz\n$$\nTo find how pressure varies with altitude, we integrate this equation. We assume that all quantities on the right side ($m$, $g$, $k_B$, $T$) are constant. Integrating from a reference altitude $z_0$ (with pressure $P_0$) to a general altitude $z$ (with pressure $P(z)$) gives:\n$$\n\\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} \\frac{1}{P'} dP' = -\\frac{mg}{k_B T} \\int_{z_0}^{z} dz'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P(z)) - \\ln(P_0) = -\\frac{mg}{k_B T} (z - z_0)\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nP(z) = P_0 \\exp\\left( -\\frac{mg}{k_B T}(z - z_0) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the barometric formula for an isothermal atmosphere.
