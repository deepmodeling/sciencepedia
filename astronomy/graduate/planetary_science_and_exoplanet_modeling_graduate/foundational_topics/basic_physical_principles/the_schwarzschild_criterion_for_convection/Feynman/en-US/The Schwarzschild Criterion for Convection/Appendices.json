The derivation will proceed from first principles as requested.\n\nThe fundamental relations we will use are:\n1.  The First Law of Thermodynamics for a reversible process, expressed per unit mass: $Tds = du + Pdv$. Using the definitions of specific enthalpy $h \\equiv u + Pv$ and specific heat at constant pressure $c_p \\equiv (\\partial h / \\partial T)_P$, this can be written as $Tds = c_p dT - v dP$, where $T$ is temperature, $s$ is specific entropy, $u$ is specific internal energy, $P$ is pressure, $v$ is specific volume ($v=1/\\rho$, where $\\rho$ is density), and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n2.  The Ideal Gas Equation of State, per unit mass: $Pv = RT$, where $R$ is the specific gas constant.\n3.  The Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium: $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g$, where $z$ is the vertical coordinate and $g$ is the local acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the dimensionless adiabatic temperature gradient, $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} \\equiv \\left(\\partial \\ln T / \\partial \\ln P\\right)_{s}$. The subscript $s$ indicates that the derivative is taken at constant specific entropy, which corresponds to an adiabatic process.\n\nFor an adiabatic process, $ds = 0$. The first law of thermodynamics becomes:\n$$c_p dT - v dP = 0$$\nUsing the ideal gas law, we replace the specific volume $v$ with $\\frac{RT}{P}$:\n$$c_p dT - \\frac{RT}{P} dP = 0$$\nRearranging the terms to separate variables $T$ and $P$:\n$$c_p dT = \\frac{RT}{P} dP$$\n$$\\frac{dT}{T} = \\frac{R}{c_p} \\frac{dP}{P}$$\nRecognizing that $d(\\ln T) = \\frac{dT}{T}$ and $d(\\ln P) = \\frac{dP}{P}$, we can write:\n$$d(\\ln T) = \\frac{R}{c_p} d(\\ln P)$$\nFrom this differential relation, the derivative of $\\ln T$ with respect to $\\ln P$ at constant entropy is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln T}{\\partial \\ln P}\\right)_{s} = \\frac{R}{c_p}$$\nTherefore, the first required expression is:\n$$\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} = \\frac{R}{c_p}$$\nFor an ideal gas, the specific heats are related by Mayer's relation, $c_p - c_v = R$, where $c_v$ is the specific heat at constant volume. The ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma \\equiv c_p / c_v$. We can express $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}}$ in terms of $\\gamma$:\n$$\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} = \\frac{c_p - c_v}{c_p} = 1 - \\frac{c_v}{c_p} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma}$$\n$$\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}$$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate, $\\Gamma_d \\equiv -dT/dz$ along an adiabatic displacement in a hydrostatic stratification. This represents the rate at which the temperature of a parcel of gas decreases as it rises adiabatically.\nWe start again from the relation for an adiabatic process:\n$$c_p dT = \\frac{1}{\\rho} dP$$\nTo find the variation with height $z$, we divide by $dz$:\n$$c_p \\frac{dT}{dz} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{dP}{dz}$$\nThe atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium, so we substitute $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g$:\n$$c_p \\frac{dT}{dz} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} (-\\rho g) = -g$$\nThe rate of change of temperature with height for the adiabatically displaced parcel is therefore:\n$$\\left(\\frac{dT}{dz}\\right)_{s} = -\\frac{g}{c_p}$$\nBy definition, the dry adiabatic lapse rate is $\\Gamma_d = - \\left(\\frac{dT}{dz}\\right)_s$. Thus, the second required expression is:\n$$\\Gamma_d = \\frac{g}{c_p}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these expressions for the given parameters.\nThe gas is an ideal diatomic gas, for which $\\gamma = 7/5$.\nThe value of $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}}$ is:\n$$\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma} = \\frac{7/5 - 1}{7/5} = \\frac{2/5}{7/5} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\nAs a decimal rounded to three significant figures:\n$$\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} \\approx 0.285714... \\approx 0.286$$\n\nTo evaluate $\\Gamma_d = g/c_p$, we need the value of $c_p$. The problem states that for this gas, $c_p = 7R/2$. We also need the specific gas constant $R$. The problem provides parameters that allow us to determine $R$. The pressure scale height, $H_p$, is defined for an ideal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium as $H_p \\equiv \\frac{P}{\\rho g}$. Using the ideal gas law $P = \\rho RT$, this becomes $H_p = \\frac{\\rho R T}{\\rho g} = \\frac{RT}{g}$.\nWe are given $g = 10\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$, $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $H_p = 8\\,\\mathrm{km} = 8000\\,\\mathrm{m}$. We can substitute these values to find $\\Gamma_d$.\nWe have two paths:\n1.  Calculate $R$ first, then $c_p$, then $\\Gamma_d$.\n2.  Substitute the expression for $c_p$ in terms of $R$ into the formula for $\\Gamma_d$, and then use the formula for $H_p$ to eliminate $R$ and $g$.\n\nLet's follow the second, more direct path to demonstrate consistency.\n$$\\Gamma_d = \\frac{g}{c_p} = \\frac{g}{7R/2} = \\frac{2g}{7R}$$\nFrom the scale height relation, we have $\\frac{g}{R} = \\frac{T}{H_p}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\Gamma_d$:\n$$\\Gamma_d = \\frac{2}{7} \\left(\\frac{g}{R}\\right) = \\frac{2}{7} \\frac{T}{H_p}$$\nNow, we can insert the given numerical values:\n$$T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$H_p = 8\\,\\mathrm{km}$$\n$$\\Gamma_d = \\frac{2}{7} \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}{8\\,\\mathrm{km}} = \\frac{600}{56} \\,\\mathrm{K\\,km^{-1}} = \\frac{75}{7} \\,\\mathrm{K\\,km^{-1}}$$\nAs a decimal rounded to three significant figures:\n$$\\Gamma_d \\approx 10.71428... \\,\\mathrm{K\\,km^{-1}} \\approx 10.7 \\,\\mathrm{K\\,km^{-1}}$$\nThe derivations are complete, and the numerical values have been calculated as required.\nThe derived expressions are $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}$ and $\\Gamma_d = \\frac{g}{c_p}$.\nThe evaluated numerical values are $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} = 0.286$ and $\\Gamma_d = 10.7\\,\\mathrm{K\\,km^{-1}}$.\nThe final answer is the row vector containing these two values.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Schwarzschild and Ledoux criteria for convection from first principles and the subsequent calculation of the stability excesses for a given exoplanet envelope layer.\n\nThe first principle for determining convective stability is to analyze the motion of a fluid parcel displaced from its equilibrium position. A layer is convectively stable if a parcel displaced vertically returns to its original position. It is unstable if the parcel continues to move away from its original position. This is governed by the buoyancy force, which depends on the density difference between the parcel and its surrounding environment.\n\nConsider a parcel of fluid at an initial pressure $P$ and radius $r$. The properties of the parcel (subscript $p$) and the environment (subscript $e$) are initially identical: $\\rho_p = \\rho_e$, $T_p = T_e$, $\\mu_p = \\mu_e$. Let us displace this parcel upward by a small distance $\\delta r  0$ to a new pressure level $P' = P+\\delta P$. Since pressure decreases with height, $\\delta P  0$. The new density of the parcel is $\\rho'_p$ and the new density of the surrounding environment is $\\rho'_e$.\n\nThe layer is stable if the displaced parcel is denser than its new surroundings, causing it to sink back. The stability condition is $\\rho'_p  \\rho'_e$. For a small displacement, we can write this as a condition on the density gradients. The density difference is $\\Delta\\rho = \\rho'_p - \\rho'_e \\approx \\left[ \\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)_p - \\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)_e \\right] \\delta r$. For stability, $\\Delta\\rho  0$ for an upward displacement ($\\delta r  0$), which implies $\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)_p  \\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)_e$.\n\nIn a body in hydrostatic equilibrium, $\\frac{dP}{dr} = -g\\rho$, where $g$ is the local acceleration due to gravity. Since $g0$ and $\\rho0$, $\\frac{dP}{dr}  0$. It is more convenient to use pressure $P$ as the independent variable. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{d}{dr} = \\frac{dP}{dr} \\frac{d}{dP}$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dr} \\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dP}\\right)_p  \\frac{dP}{dr} \\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dP}\\right)_e\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dP}{dr}$ is negative, we must reverse the inequality when dividing by it:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dP}\\right)_p  \\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dP}\\right)_e\n$$\nTo work with the dimensionless gradients provided in the problem, we convert this to a condition on the logarithmic derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{P}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dP}\\right)_p  \\frac{P}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dP}\\right)_e \\implies \\left(\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P}\\right)_p  \\left(\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P}\\right)_e\n$$\nThis is the general condition for convective stability in terms of logarithmic pressure derivatives of density.\n\nNext, we express these derivatives in terms of thermal and compositional gradients. The density $\\rho$ is a function of pressure $P$, temperature $T$, and mean molecular weight $\\mu$. The total differential of $\\ln\\rho$ is:\n$$\nd\\ln\\rho = \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln P}\\right)_{T,\\mu} d\\ln P + \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln T}\\right)_{P,\\mu} d\\ln T + \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln\\mu}\\right)_{P,T} d\\ln\\mu\n$$\nUsing the thermodynamic derivatives defined in the problem, $\\delta \\equiv -\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln T}\\right)_{P,\\mu}$ and $\\phi \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln\\mu}\\right)_{P,T}$, this becomes:\n$$\nd\\ln\\rho = \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln P}\\right)_{T,\\mu} d\\ln P - \\delta\\, d\\ln T + \\phi\\, d\\ln\\mu\n$$\nFor an ideal gas ($P \\propto \\rho T/\\mu$), $\\rho \\propto P T^{-1} \\mu$. Taking the logarithm gives $\\ln\\rho = \\ln P - \\ln T + \\ln \\mu + \\text{constant}$. From this, we find $\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\rho}{\\partial\\ln P}\\right)_{T,\\mu}=1$, which is consistent with the provided values $\\delta=1$ and $\\phi=1$.\nThus, the logarithmic pressure derivative of density is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P} = 1 - \\delta \\frac{d\\ln T}{d\\ln P} + \\phi \\frac{d\\ln\\mu}{d\\ln P}\n$$\nNow we apply this to the environment and the parcel.\n\nFor the environment (subscript $e$), the gradients are the actual gradients present in the layer: $\\frac{d\\ln T_e}{d\\ln P} = \\nabla$ and $\\frac{d\\ln\\mu_e}{d\\ln P} = \\nabla_\\mu$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P}\\right)_e = 1 - \\delta\\nabla + \\phi\\nabla_\\mu\n$$\nFor the displaced parcel (subscript $p$), the displacement is assumed to be rapid and adiabatic. Therefore, the parcel's temperature gradient follows the adiabatic temperature gradient, $\\frac{d\\ln T_p}{d\\ln P} = \\nabla_{\\text{ad}}$. The parcel's composition does not have time to change, so it remains fixed: $\\frac{d\\ln\\mu_p}{d\\ln P} = 0$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P}\\right)_p = 1 - \\delta\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} + \\phi(0) = 1 - \\delta\\nabla_{\\text{ad}}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the stability condition $\\left(\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P}\\right)_p  \\left(\\frac{d\\ln\\rho}{d\\ln P}\\right)_e$:\n$$\n1 - \\delta\\nabla_{\\text{ad}}  1 - \\delta\\nabla + \\phi\\nabla_\\mu\n$$\n$$\n-\\delta\\nabla_{\\text{ad}}  -\\delta\\nabla + \\phi\\nabla_\\mu\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\nabla  \\delta\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} + \\phi\\nabla_\\mu\n$$\nDividing by $\\delta$ (which is positive) yields the stability condition:\n$$\n\\nabla  \\nabla_{\\text{ad}} + \\frac{\\phi}{\\delta}\\nabla_\\mu\n$$\nThis is the **Ledoux criterion** for convective stability. A layer becomes convectively unstable when the actual temperature gradient $\\nabla$ exceeds the threshold $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}} + \\frac{\\phi}{\\delta}\\nabla_\\mu$. A positive composition gradient ($\\nabla_\\mu  0$, i.e., mean molecular weight increasing with depth/pressure) has a stabilizing effect.\n\nThe **Schwarzschild criterion** is derived by ignoring the effect of the composition gradient, which is equivalent to setting $\\nabla_\\mu = 0$ in the Ledoux criterion. The stability condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla  \\nabla_{\\text{ad}}\n$$\nThis criterion states that a layer is unstable if the actual temperature gradient is super-adiabatic ($\\nabla  \\nabla_{\\text{ad}}$).\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless excesses $E_{\\mathrm{S}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$, defined as the difference between the actual thermal gradient and the respective instability thresholds.\nThe Schwarzschild instability threshold is $\\nabla_{\\text{ad}}$.

This occurs when the background atmosphere cools with height faster than the displaced parcel cools by adiabatic expansion.\n\nLet us formally derive the necessary quantities. The physical (or ambient) temperature lapse rate is defined as the rate of temperature decrease with increasing geometric height $z$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(P) = -\\frac{dT}{dz}\n$$\nTo evaluate this derivative, we use the chain rule to change the independent variable from height $z$ to the natural logarithm of pressure, $\\ln P$, as the problem requires computation on a $\\ln P$ grid.\n$$\n\\Gamma(P) = -\\frac{dT}{d\\ln P} \\frac{d\\ln P}{dz}\n$$\nThe term $d\\ln P/dz$ can be related to the pressure scale height, $H_p$, which is defined as:\n$$\nH_p = -P \\left( \\frac{dP}{dz} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we have $dP/dz = -P/H_p$. The derivative of $\\ln P$ with respect to $z$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln P}{dz} = \\frac{d\\ln P}{dP} \\frac{dP}{dz} = \\frac{1}{P} \\left( -\\frac{P}{H_p} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{H_p}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Gamma(P)$ yields:\n$$\n\\Gamma(P) = -\\frac{dT}{d\\ln P} \\left( -\\frac{1}{H_p(P)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{H_p(P)} \\frac{dT}{d\\ln P}\n$$\nNext, we must express the pressure scale height $H_p(P)$ in terms of the given atmospheric properties. We start from its definition in terms of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, $dP/dz = -\\rho g$:\n$$\nH_p(P) = -P \\left( \\frac{dP}{dz} \\right)^{-1} = -P (-\\rho g)^{-1} = \\frac{P}{\\rho g}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. We use the ideal gas equation of state, $P = \\rho R T$, to eliminate the density $\\rho$. The specific gas constant $R$ is given by the universal gas constant $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ divided by the mean molecular mass $M$, so $R=R_{\\mathrm{u}}/M$. Substituting $\\rho = P/(RT)$ into the expression for $H_p$:\n$$\nH_p(P) = \\frac{P}{(P/(RT)) g} = \\frac{RT(P)}{g} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{u}} T(P)}{M g}\n$$\nNow, we can write the full expression for the physical lapse rate in terms of the given functions and constants:\n$$\n\\Gamma(P) = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{u}} T(P)}{M g} \\right)^{-1} \\frac{dT}{d\\ln P} = \\frac{M g}{R_{\\mathrm{u}} T(P)} \\frac{dT}{d\\ln P}\n$$\nThe second key quantity is the dry adiabatic lapse rate, $\\Gamma_d(P)$. This is the rate at which a parcel of gas cools as it expands adiabatically while rising. It is given as:\n$$\n\\Gamma_d(P) = \\frac{g}{c_p(P)}\n$$\nwhere $c_p(P)$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure.\n\nThe Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability is met when the physical lapse rate exceeds the adiabatic lapse rate:\n$$\n\\Gamma(P)  \\Gamma_d(P)\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{M g}{R_{\\mathrm{u}} T(P)} \\frac{dT}{d\\ln P}  \\frac{g}{c_p(P)}\n$$\nSince $g  0$, we can simplify this to:\n$$\n\\frac{M}{R_{\\mathrm{u}} T(P)} \\frac{dT}{d\\ln P}  \\frac{1}{c_p(P)}\n$$\nThis inequality must be evaluated at each point on the pressure grid.\n\nThe numerical implementation will proceed as follows:\n1.  For each test case, establish the constants $g$, $M$, $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and the functions $T(P)$ and $c_p(P)$.\n2.  Construct a grid of $N=2001$ points uniformly spaced in $\\ln P$ over the domain $[P_{\\min}, P_{\\max}]$, and the corresponding pressure grid $P_i = \\exp((\\ln P)_i)$.\n3.  Evaluate the temperature $T_i = T(P_i)$ and heat capacity $c_{p,i} = c_p(P_i)$ for all points $i$ on the grid.\n4.  Numerically compute the derivative $(dT/d\\ln P)_i$ at each grid point. We will use a second-order central difference for interior points and second-order one-sided differences for the endpoints, as implemented by `numpy.gradient`.\n5.  Calculate the physical lapse rate $\\Gamma_i$ and the adiabatic lapse rate $\\Gamma_{d,i}$ at each grid point using the formulas derived above.\n6.  For each grid point $i$, determine if the Schwarzschild criterion $\\Gamma_i  \\Gamma_{d,i}$ is satisfied. This yields a boolean array indicating unstable points.\n7.  Identify all contiguous segments of unstable grid points. A segment from index $i_{start}$ to $i_{end}$ corresponds to a convective interval $[P_{start}, P_{end}] = [P_{i_{start}}, P_{i_{end}}]$.\n8.  Round the pressure endpoints of each interval to the nearest integer.\n9.  Collect the list of intervals for each test case and format the final output as specified. If no unstable points are found for a case, an empty list is returned.",
