It is scientifically grounded in the principles of blackbody radiation, well-posed with sufficient information for all required tasks, and objectively stated.

This flux is the integral of the spectral flux, $F = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_{\\lambda} d\\lambda$. For a real object with wavelength-dependent emissivity $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$ and a surface/atmospheric temperature profile $T_{\\mathrm{phys}}$, the emitted spectral flux is $F_{\\lambda} = \\epsilon(\\lambda) \\pi B_{\\lambda}(T_{\\mathrm{phys}})$. In a planetary atmosphere, emission at different wavelengths originates from different altitudes, which have different physical temperatures.\nThe temperature $T_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 673.9\\,\\mathrm{K}$ was derived by applying Wien's law, which is strictly valid for an ideal blackbody, to the peak of the observed spectrum. The peak of the observed spectrum, however, is the maximum of $F_\\lambda = \\epsilon(\\lambda) \\pi B_{\\lambda}(T_{\\mathrm{phys}}(\\lambda))$, not of $B_{\\lambda}$ itself.\n\n1.  **Wavelength-Dependent Emissivity and Molecular Absorption:** A real planetary atmosphere has a highly structured emissivity spectrum, characterized by strong molecular absorption bands (low $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$) and relatively transparent \"windows\" (high $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$). The peak of a spectrum at $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 4.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is particularly significant, as this corresponds to a very strong absorption band of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). Emission at the center of such a strong band originates from high altitudes in the planet's atmosphere, where the gas is optically thick and the temperature is typically lower than in deeper layers. In contrast, the atmospheric windows allow us to see emission from deeper, hotter layers.\n\n2.  **Bias against Effective Temperature:** The effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is determined by the total power radiated across all wavelengths. The bulk of this power is emitted through the atmospheric windows, where the emissivity is high and the temperature of the emitting layers is high. The flux in strong absorption bands, coming from cold upper layers, contributes relatively little to the total integrated flux. Therefore, $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is generally representative of the higher temperatures of the deeper atmospheric layers.\n\nIn conclusion, the temperature $T_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 673.9\\,\\mathrm{K}$ inferred from the peak at the $4.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ CO$_2$ band is a brightness temperature that probes the cold, high-altitude region of the planet's atmosphere. This value is expected to be significantly *lower* than the planet's effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which is a flux-weighted average temperature dominated by emission from hotter, deeper regions of the atmosphere. The temperature derived from a single spectral feature is thus a valuable probe of atmospheric structure but is not a measure of the planet's overall energy balance.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Top-of-Atmosphere Radiance**\nThe TOA monochromatic radiance, $I_\\lambda(\\text{TOA})$, for a non-scattering, plane-parallel atmosphere viewed at nadir is the sum of two components: 1) the surface emission attenuated by the atmosphere, and 2) the emission from the atmosphere itself.\n\n1.  The surface is Lambertian and assumed to be a blackbody (emissivity of $1$), so it emits with a spectral radiance given by Planck's law, $B_\\lambda(T_s)$.\n2.  The atmospheric transmittance, $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$, is the fraction of surface radiation that passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed.\n3.  The atmospheric spectral absorptivity, $\\alpha_\\lambda$, is the fraction of radiation absorbed. For a non-scattering medium, $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda + \\alpha_\\lambda = 1$.\n4.  By Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, for a medium in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the spectral emissivity $\\epsilon_\\lambda$ is equal to the spectral absorptivity $\\alpha_\\lambda$. Thus, $\\epsilon_\\lambda = \\alpha_\\lambda = 1 - \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$, which implies $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda = 1 - \\epsilon_\\lambda$.\n5.  The radiance from the surface that reaches the TOA is $B_\\lambda(T_s) \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda = B_\\lambda(T_s) (1 - \\epsilon_\\lambda)$.\n6.  The atmosphere is isothermal with temperature $T_a$, so it emits with a spectral radiance of $\\epsilon_\\lambda B_\\lambda(T_a)$.\n\nCombining these components, the total TOA monochromatic nadir radiance is:\n$$I_\\lambda(\\text{TOA}) = B_\\lambda(T_s) (1 - \\epsilon_\\lambda) + \\epsilon_\\lambda B_\\lambda(T_a)$$\nThis equation represents a linear combination of the radiances from the surface and the atmosphere, weighted by the atmospheric transmittance and emissivity, respectively.\n\n**Calculation of Brightness Temperature**\nThe spectral radiance of an ideal blackbody is given by Planck's law:\n$$B_\\lambda(T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1}$$\nThe problem is for a wavelength $\\lambda = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. This falls within the specified atmospheric window, so the atmospheric emissivity is $\\epsilon_\\lambda = 0.15$.

A planet's spectrally integrated emission is characterized by an *effective temperature* $T_{eff}$, defined by this law. The brightness temperature $T_b(\\lambda)$ we calculated is, by contrast, a monochromatic (narrowband) quantity.\nIn this problem, the atmosphere has a spectral window at $8-12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ where it is largely transparent ($\\epsilon_\\lambda=0.15$). In this window, an observer sees a mix of emission dominated by the warm surface at $T_s=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This is why the brightness temperature $T_b(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 295.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is close to the surface temperature.\nOutside this window, the atmosphere is optically thick ($\\epsilon_\\lambda = 1$). An observer looking at the planet at these wavelengths would see only the emission from the top of the atmosphere, making a measurement of $I_\\lambda(\\text{TOA}) = B_\\lambda(T_a)$, which corresponds to a brightness temperature of $T_b(\\lambda) = T_a = 260\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe effective temperature $T_{eff}$, derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law applied to the total spectrum, would be an average of these different brightness temperatures, weighted by their energetic contribution. Since a large part of the thermal spectrum is emitted from the colder $260\\,\\mathrm{K}$ layer, $T_{eff}$ would be significantly lower than $295\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and closer to $260\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The atmospheric window thus allows us to probe the warmer surface, resulting in a band-specific brightness temperature that is much higher than the planet's overall effective temperature. This is a key principle used in remote sensing to determine surface temperatures of planets with atmospheres.",

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The governing energy balance equation is $C \\frac{dT}{dt} = S(t) - \\varepsilon\\sigma T^{4}$.\n- $C$ is the areal heat capacity per unit area.\n- $T(t)$ is the surface temperature as a function of time $t$.\n- $S(t)$ is the time-dependent net absorbed stellar radiative flux, given by $S(t) = S_{0} + S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t)$.\n- $\\varepsilon$ is the surface longwave emissivity.\n- $\\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.\n- $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the diurnal forcing.\n- $S_{1}$ is assumed to be sufficiently small relative to $S_{0}$.\n- The mean temperature $\\bar{T}$ is defined by the steady-state balance $\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{4} = S_{0}$.\n- The desired solution is for the steady periodic response $T(t) = \\bar{T} + \\theta(t)$, where $\\theta(t) = \\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}}\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$.\n- The objective is to find expressions for the amplitude $\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ and the phase lag $\\phi$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the fundamental principle of energy conservation and the well-established Stefan–Boltzmann law for thermal radiation. This is a canonical problem in planetary science and climate modeling. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It describes a first-order ordinary differential equation with a periodic forcing function. The assumption of a small forcing amplitude ($S_1 \\ll S_0$) justifies the linearization, which ensures a unique, stable, steady-state periodic solution exists. The goals are clearly defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, unbiased, and formal language.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: All necessary parameters ($C$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\sigma$, $\\bar{T}$, $S_{1}$, $\\omega$) are provided symbolically. There are no contradictions. The definition of $\\bar{T}$ is consistent with the overall energy balance.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The model is a simplification (e.g., airless, homogeneous surface) but is a standard and physically plausible first-order approximation used in exoplanet characterization.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the governing energy balance equation:\n$$\nC \\frac{dT}{dt} = S(t) - \\varepsilon\\sigma T^{4}\n$$\nWe are given the form of the absorbed flux $S(t) = S_{0} + S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t)$ and we seek a solution of the form $T(t) = \\bar{T} + \\theta(t)$, where $\\bar{T}$ is the constant mean temperature and $\\theta(t)$ represents the small diurnal temperature variation. Substituting these into the governing equation yields:\n$$\nC \\frac{d}{dt}(\\bar{T} + \\theta(t)) = (S_{0} + S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t)) - \\varepsilon\\sigma (\\bar{T} + \\theta(t))^{4}\n$$\nSince $\\bar{T}$ is a constant, its time derivative is zero, so the left-hand side (LHS) becomes $C \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$. For the right-hand side (RHS), we linearize the thermal emission term $\\varepsilon\\sigma T^{4}$ around the mean temperature $\\bar{T}$. This is justified by the problem statement's assumption that $S_{1}$ is small, implying that the resulting temperature oscillation $\\theta(t)$ is small compared to $\\bar{T}$ (i.e., $|\\theta(t)| \\ll \\bar{T}$).\n\nUsing a first-order Taylor series expansion for the function $f(T) = T^{4}$ around $T = \\bar{T}$:\n$$\nT^{4} = (\\bar{T} + \\theta)^{4} \\approx \\bar{T}^{4} + \\left.\\frac{d(T^{4})}{dT}\\right|_{T=\\bar{T}} \\theta = \\bar{T}^{4} + 4\\bar{T}^{3}\\theta\n$$\nSubstituting this linearization back into the energy balance equation:\n$$\nC \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = (S_{0} + S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t)) - \\varepsilon\\sigma (\\bar{T}^{4} + 4\\bar{T}^{3}\\theta)\n$$\n$$\nC \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = S_{0} + S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t) - \\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{4} - 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}\\theta\n$$\nThe mean temperature $\\bar{T}$ is defined by the steady-state balance $S_{0} = \\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{4}$. Using this definition, the constant terms on the RHS cancel out:\n$$\nC \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t) - 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}\\theta\n$$\nRearranging this gives a standard first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients for the temperature perturbation $\\theta(t)$:\n$$\nC \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}\\theta = S_{1}\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nTo find the steady-state periodic solution, it is convenient to use complex analysis. We introduce a complex forcing term $S_{c}(t) = S_{1}e^{i\\omega t}$ and seek a complex solution $\\theta_{c}(t) = \\tilde{\\theta}e^{i\\omega t}$, where $\\tilde{\\theta}$ is a complex amplitude. The physical solution $\\theta(t)$ will be the real part of $\\theta_{c}(t)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nC \\frac{d}{dt}(\\tilde{\\theta}e^{i\\omega t}) + 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}(\\tilde{\\theta}e^{i\\omega t}) = S_{1}e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\n$$\nC (i\\omega \\tilde{\\theta}e^{i\\omega t}) + 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}(\\tilde{\\theta}e^{i\\omega t}) = S_{1}e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nDividing through by $e^{i\\omega t}$ (which is never zero), we can solve for the complex amplitude $\\tilde{\\theta}$:\n$$\n(iC\\omega + 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3})\\tilde{\\theta} = S_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\theta} = \\frac{S_{1}}{4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3} + iC\\omega}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the solution in the form $\\theta(t) = \\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}}\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$. This is the real part of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}} e^{i(\\omega t - \\phi)} = (\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}} e^{-i\\phi})e^{i\\omega t}$. By comparing this with $\\theta_{c}(t) = \\tilde{\\theta}e^{i\\omega t}$, we can identify $\\tilde{\\theta} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}} e^{-i\\phi}$.\n\nThe amplitude of the temperature oscillation, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}}$, is the magnitude of the complex amplitude $\\tilde{\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}} = |\\tilde{\\theta}| = \\left|\\frac{S_{1}}{4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3} + iC\\omega}\\right| = \\frac{|S_{1}|}{|4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3} + iC\\omega|}\n$$\nAssuming $S_{1}$ is a positive amplitude, $|S_{1}|=S_{1}$. The magnitude of the complex denominator is $\\sqrt{(4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3})^{2} + (C\\omega)^{2}}$. Therefore, the amplitude is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}} = \\frac{S_{1}}{\\sqrt{(4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3})^{2} + (C\\omega)^{2}}}\n$$\nThe phase lag $\\phi$ is related to the argument of $\\tilde{\\theta}$. We have $\\arg(\\tilde{\\theta}) = -\\phi$. From the expression for $\\tilde{\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\arg(\\tilde{\\theta}) = \\arg\\left(\\frac{S_{1}}{4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3} + iC\\omega}\\right) = \\arg(S_{1}) - \\arg(4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3} + iC\\omega)\n$$\nSince $S_{1}$ is a positive real number, $\\arg(S_{1})=0$. Thus:\n$$\n-\\phi = - \\arg(4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3} + iC\\omega)\n$$\nThe argument of a complex number $a+ib$ is $\\arctan(b/a)$. In our case, $a = 4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}$ and $b = C\\omega$. Both are positive physical quantities, so the argument is in the first quadrant.\n$$\n\\phi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{C\\omega}{4\\varepsilon\\sigma\\bar{T}^{3}}\\right)\n$$\nThese expressions for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{amp}}$ and $\\phi$ are the required closed-form analytical results.",
