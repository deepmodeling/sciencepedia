            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of equations and boundary conditions to derive the pressure profile within a simplified model of a planetary interior. The problem is a standard exercise in hydrostatic equilibrium and is free of any invalidating flaws.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the pressure profile, $P(r)$, inside a self-gravitating sphere of uniform density $\\rho$ and radius $R$. The derivation proceeds in three main steps: first, determining the enclosed mass $M(r)$; second, finding the gravitational acceleration $g(r)$; and third, integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to find $P(r)$.\n\nThe first step is to find the mass $M(r)$ enclosed within a radius $r$, where $0 \\le r \\le R$. The problem provides the mass-continuity relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}r} = 4 \\pi r^{2} \\rho $$\nThis ordinary differential equation can be solved by direct integration from the center (where $r=0$ and $M=0$) to an arbitrary radius $r$. Since the density $\\rho$ is given as a constant:\n$$ M(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}r'} \\, \\mathrm{d}r' = \\int_{0}^{r} 4 \\pi (r')^{2} \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}r' $$\n$$ M(r) = 4 \\pi \\rho \\int_{0}^{r} (r')^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}r' = 4 \\pi \\rho \\left[ \\frac{(r')^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{r} $$\n$$ M(r) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\rho r^{3} $$\nThis result confirms that the enclosed mass is simply the volume of a sphere of radius $r$ multiplied by the constant density $\\rho$.\n\nThe second step is to determine the local gravitational acceleration $g(r)$ at radius $r$. The problem states this follows from Newtonian gravity for the enclosed mass:\n$$ g(r) = \\frac{G M(r)}{r^{2}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $M(r)$ derived above yields:\n$$ g(r) = \\frac{G}{r^{2}} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\rho r^{3} \\right) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho r $$\nThis shows that the gravitational acceleration inside a uniform sphere increases linearly with the distance from the center.\n\nThe third and final step is to solve for the pressure profile $P(r)$. The planet is in hydrostatic equilibrium, satisfying the equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}r} = - \\rho \\, g(r) $$\nThe negative sign indicates that pressure must increase toward the center to counteract the inward pull of gravity. Substituting the expression for $g(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}r} = - \\rho \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho r \\right) = - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} r $$\nTo find $P(r)$, we integrate this equation with respect to $r$:\n$$ P(r) = \\int \\left( - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} r \\right) \\mathrm{d}r = - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} \\int r \\, \\mathrm{d}r $$\n$$ P(r) = - \\frac{4}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} \\frac{r^{2}}{2} + C = - \\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} r^{2} + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To determine $C$, we apply the boundary condition that the pressure at the surface of the planet ($r=R$) is zero, i.e., $P(R) = 0$.\n$$ P(R) = - \\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} R^{2} + C = 0 $$\nSolving for $C$, we find:\n$$ C = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} R^{2} $$\nSubstituting this value of $C$ back into the general expression for $P(r)$:\n$$ P(r) = - \\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} r^{2} + \\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} R^{2} $$\nFactoring out the common terms provides the final closed-form analytical expression for the pressure profile:\n$$ P(r) = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi G \\rho^{2} (R^{2} - r^{2}) $$\nThis expression gives the pressure at any radius $r$ within the exoplanetary model, for $0 \\le r \\le R$, in terms of the given physical constants and parameters.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for two main tasks: first, to derive the vertical momentum equation from first principles and define a nondimensional parameter quantifying departures from hydrostatic equilibrium; second, to calculate the value of this parameter for a specific hot Jupiter atmosphere model.\n\nThe problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics applied to planetary atmospheres, a standard practice in the field. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the constraints are consistent and physically plausible for the context of a hot Jupiter.\n\nFirst, we derive the vertical momentum equation. We consider a small, fixed-mass fluid parcel of volume $\\delta V$ and density $\\rho$. According to Newton's second law, the net force on the parcel equals its mass times its acceleration. The acceleration of the fluid parcel is given by the material derivative of the velocity vector, $\\frac{D\\vec{v}}{Dt}$. The mass of the parcel is $m = \\rho \\delta V$.\n\nWe focus on the vertical component ($z$-direction) of the motion. The forces acting on the fluid parcel in the vertical direction are the pressure gradient force and the gravitational force. Let the parcel have a horizontal cross-sectional area $\\delta A$ and a vertical thickness $\\delta z$, so $\\delta V = \\delta A \\delta z$. The pressure on the bottom surface at height $z$ is $P(z)$ and on the top surface at $z+\\delta z$ is $P(z+\\delta z)$. The net pressure force in the vertical direction is $F_{P,z} = P(z) \\delta A - P(z+\\delta z) \\delta A = -[P(z+\\delta z) - P(z)] \\delta A$. For an infinitesimally small parcel, this is approximately $F_{P,z} \\approx -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} \\delta z \\delta A = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} \\delta V$.\n\nThe gravitational force is $F_{g,z} = -mg = -(\\rho \\delta V) g$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, defined as positive, and the negative sign indicates the force is directed downward (in the negative $z$ direction).\n\nThe problem states that vertical Coriolis and viscous terms are negligible. Therefore, the sum of vertical forces is $\\sum F_z = F_{P,z} + F_{g,z} = (-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} - \\rho g)\\delta V$.\n\nThe vertical component of Newton's second law for the fluid parcel is $m \\frac{Dw}{Dt} = \\sum F_z$, where $w$ is the vertical component of the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$. Substituting the expressions for mass and force:\n$$(\\rho \\delta V) \\frac{Dw}{Dt} = \\left(-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} - \\rho g\\right) \\delta V$$\nDividing by the mass density $\\rho$ and the volume $\\delta V$ yields the vertical momentum equation:\n$$\\frac{Dw}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} - g$$\n\nHydrostatic equilibrium is the state in which there is no vertical acceleration, $\\frac{Dw}{Dt} = 0$. In this case, the vertical momentum equation reduces to a balance between the pressure gradient force and gravity:\n$$-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} - g = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g$$\nThe regime in which this balance holds is when the material vertical acceleration, $\\frac{Dw}{Dt}$, is negligible compared to the gravitational acceleration, $g$. A nondimensional parameter that quantifies the departure from hydrostatic balance can be defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the material vertical acceleration to the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration. This parameter, which we denote by $\\epsilon$, is precisely what the problem asks for:\n$$\\epsilon \\equiv \\frac{|Dw/Dt|}{g}$$\nThe condition for the validity of the hydrostatic approximation is $\\epsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\epsilon$ for the given hot Jupiter model. The material derivative of the vertical velocity $w$ is given by:\n$$\\frac{Dw}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + w \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}$$\nThe problem provides an approximation for its magnitude based on scale analysis:\n$$\\left|\\frac{Dw}{Dt}\\right| \\approx \\left|\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t}\\right| + \\left|u \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right| + \\left|v \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\\right| + \\left|w \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}\\right|$$\nWe use the characteristic scales provided to estimate each term:\n$|\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t}| \\sim \\frac{W}{\\tau}$, $|u \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}| \\sim U \\frac{W}{L_h}$, $|v \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}| \\sim V \\frac{W}{L_h}$, and $|w \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}| \\sim W \\frac{W}{H}$.\n\nThe given characteristic scales are:\n- $U = 3.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\text{m s}^{-1}$\n- $V = 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\text{m s}^{-1}$\n- $W = 50 \\, \\text{m s}^{-1}$\n- $L_h = 1.5 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m}$\n- $H = 5.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{m}$\n- $\\tau = 6.0 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\text{s}$\n- $g = 12 \\, \\text{m s}^{-2}$\n\nWe now compute the magnitude of each term in the material derivative:\n1.

The derivatives transform as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho}{dr} = \\frac{d\\rho}{d\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\frac{d\\xi}{dr} = (\\rho_c n \\theta^{n-1})\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\right) $$\nSubstituting these into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{K(n+1)}{n}\\frac{1}{a^2 \\xi^2}\\frac{d}{a d\\xi}\\left( (a\\xi)^2 (\\rho_c \\theta^n)^{(1-n)/n} \\frac{\\rho_c n \\theta^{n-1}}{a}\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi} \\right) = -4 \\pi G \\rho_c\\theta^n $$\nAfter simplification, the expression becomes:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{(n+1)K \\rho_c^{(1/n)-1}}{4 \\pi G a^2}\\right] \\frac{1}{\\xi^2}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) = - \\theta^n $$\nThe length scale $a$ is chosen to make the term in brackets equal to $1$:\n$$ a^2 = \\frac{(n+1)K \\rho_c^{(1-n)/n}}{4 \\pi G} \\implies a = \\left[\\frac{(n+1)K}{4\\pi G}\\right]^{1/2}\\rho_c^{(1-n)/(2n)} $$\nWith this choice, we arrive at the general Lane-Emden equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\xi^2}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) + \\theta^n = 0 $$\nFor the specific case $n=1$, the equation for the length scale $a$ simplifies significantly, as the term involving $\\rho_c$ vanishes:\n$$ a = \\left[\\frac{(1+1)K}{4\\pi G}\\right]^{1/2}\\rho_c^{(1-1)/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{4\\pi G}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2\\pi G}} $$\nThe Lane-Emden equation for $n=1$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\xi^2}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) + \\theta = 0 $$\nwhich can also be written as $\\xi^2\\theta'' + 2\\xi\\theta' + \\xi^2\\theta = 0$.\n\n### Numerical Solution Strategy\nThe Lane-Emden equation for $n=1$ is a second-order ordinary differential equation. This specific case has a well-known analytical solution, $\\theta(\\xi) = \\frac{\\sin(\\xi)}{\\xi}$, which satisfies the boundary conditions $\\theta(0)=1$ and $\\theta'(0)=0$. The first zero, $\\xi_1$, where the density and pressure become zero, corresponds to the first non-trivial root of $\\sin(\\xi)$, which is $\\xi_1=\\pi$. The physical radius is $R=a\\xi_1$.\n\nAlthough an analytical solution exists, the problem requires a numerical solution. To proceed numerically, we first convert the second-order ODE into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let $y_0 = \\theta$ and $y_1 = \\theta' = d\\theta/d\\xi$. The system is:\n$$ \\frac{dy_0}{d\\xi} = y_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dy_1}{d\\xi} = -\\frac{2}{\\xi}y_1 - y_0 $$\nA singularity exists at $\\xi=0$ due to the $1/\\xi$ term. We cannot start the integration at $\\xi=0$. Instead, we use a series expansion for $\\theta(\\xi)$ around $\\xi=0$ to find initial values at a small, non-zero $\\xi_{start}$. The general series solution is of the form $\\theta(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k \\xi^k$. Applying the boundary conditions, the series for the $n=1$ case is found to be:\n$$ \\theta(\\xi) = 1 - \\frac{1}{6}\\xi^2 + \\frac{1}{120}\\xi^4 - \\dots $$\nThe derivative is:\n$$ \\theta'(\\xi) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{30}\\xi^3 - \\dots $$\nWe use these truncated series to set initial conditions at a small $\\xi_{start} \\ll 1$:\n$$ y_0(\\xi_{start}) \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\xi_{start}^2}{6} $$\n$$ y_1(\\xi_{start}) \\approx -\\frac{\\xi_{start}}{3} $$\nWith these initial values, we can use a numerical integrator (such as a Runge-Kutta method, as implemented in `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`) to solve the system from $\\xi_{start}$ outwards. An event-finding capability is used to precisely locate the first root $\\xi_1$ where $y_0(\\xi) = \\theta(\\xi)$ crosses zero.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Numerically solve the $n=1$ Lane-Emden ODE system with the specified initial conditions to find $\\xi_1$. The result of this numerical integration should be extremely close to the analytical value, $\\pi$.\n2.  For each pair of $(K, \\rho_c)$ from the test suite, calculate the characteristic length scale $a = \\sqrt{K/(2\\pi G)}$. Notice that for $n=1$, $a$ is independent of the central density $\\rho_c$.\n3.  Compute the physical radius of the sphere using $R = a \\xi_1$.\n4.  Round the final value of $R$ for each case to three significant figures.\n\nThe implementation will carry out these steps to produce the required output.",
