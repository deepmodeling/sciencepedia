            "solution": "The problem is to determine the maximum-likelihood estimate for the surface age $T$ of a geological unit on an exoplanet, based on crater counts in two diameter bins. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in planetary science, mathematically well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of data and assumptions.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the model for the expected number of observed craters in each bin as a function of the unknown age $T$. Then, the likelihood function for the observed counts is constructed. Finally, this function is maximized with respect to $T$ to find the estimator, which is then evaluated numerically.\n\n**1. Modeling the Expected Crater Counts**\n\nLet $T$ be the surface age in gigayears (Gyr). The derivation is performed for a generic bin $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\n- **Primary Craters:** The formation of primary craters is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process with a production rate $R_i$ (in units of $\\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$). The effective area over which craters are counted is $A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = g A_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, where $A_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total mapped area and $g$ is the usable coverage fraction. The mean number of primary craters formed in bin $i$ over time $T$ is given by the product of rate, area, and time:\n$$ \\lambda_{P,i}(T) = R_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}} T $$\n\n- **Secondary Craters:** The problem states that residual secondary craters are produced in proportion to primary craters, with a constant, bin-independent ratio $q$. We model the formation of these secondaries as an independent Poisson process with a rate proportional to the primary rate, i.e., $q R_i$. Therefore, the total rate of crater *formation* (primaries plus secondaries) in bin $i$ is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{form},i} = R_i + qR_i = (1+q)R_i $$\nThe superposition of two independent Poisson processes is another Poisson process. Thus, the mean number of total craters (primary and secondary) formed in bin $i$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{form},i}(T) = R_{\\mathrm{form},i} A_{\\mathrm{eff}} T = (1+q)R_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}} T $$\n\n- **Detected Craters:** Not all formed craters are detected. Detection is an independent Bernoulli process with a bin-dependent probability $p_i$. According to the property of binomial thinning, if the number of formed craters $K_{\\mathrm{form},i}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{form},i}$, then the number of detected craters $N_i$ also follows a Poisson distribution with a mean $\\lambda_i$ that is scaled by the detection probability $p_i$:\n$$ \\lambda_i(T) = p_i \\lambda_{\\mathrm{form},i}(T) = p_i (1+q) R_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}} T $$\nThis expression for $\\lambda_i(T)$ represents the expected number of observed craters in bin $i$ as a function of the surface age $T$.\n\n**2. The Likelihood Function**\n\nThe problem states that crater counts in disjoint diameter bins are independent conditional on the surface age $T$. The observed counts are $N_1$ and $N_2$. Since each $N_i$ is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $\\lambda_i(T)$, the probability of observing the specific count $N_i$ is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$ P(N_i | T) = \\frac{(\\lambda_i(T))^{N_i} \\exp(-\\lambda_i(T))}{N_i!} $$\nThe joint likelihood function $L(T)$ for observing the pair of counts $(N_1, N_2)$ is the product of the individual probabilities due to their conditional independence:\n$$ L(T) = P(N_1 | T) \\cdot P(N_2 | T) = \\frac{(\\lambda_1(T))^{N_1} \\exp(-\\lambda_1(T))}{N_1!} \\cdot \\frac{(\\lambda_2(T))^{N_2} \\exp(-\\lambda_2(T))}{N_2!} $$\n\n**3. Maximum-Likelihood Estimation**\n\nTo find the value of $T$ that maximizes $L(T)$, it is more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(T) = \\ln(L(T))$:\n$$ \\ell(T) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\lambda_1(T)^{N_1} \\lambda_2(T)^{N_2} \\exp(-(\\lambda_1(T) + \\lambda_2(T)))}{N_1! N_2!} \\right) $$\n$$ \\ell(T) = N_1 \\ln(\\lambda_1(T)) + N_2 \\ln(\\lambda_2(T)) - (\\lambda_1(T) + \\lambda_2(T)) - \\ln(N_1! N_2!) $$\nLet us substitute the expression for $\\lambda_i(T) = p_i (1+q) R_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}} T$. We can define constants $C_i = p_i (1+q) R_i A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, such that $\\lambda_i(T) = C_i T$. The log-likelihood becomes:\n$$ \\ell(T) = N_1 \\ln(C_1 T) + N_2 \\ln(C_2 T) - (C_1 T + C_2 T) + \\text{const.} $$\n$$ \\ell(T) = N_1(\\ln C_1 + \\ln T) + N_2(\\ln C_2 + \\ln T) - (C_1 + C_2)T + \\text{const.} $$\n$$ \\ell(T) = (N_1 + N_2)\\ln T - (C_1 + C_2)T + \\text{const.} $$\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative with respect to $T$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{dT} = \\frac{N_1 + N_2}{T} - (C_1 + C_2) = 0 $$\nSolving for the maximum-likelihood estimator $\\hat{T}$:\n$$ \\hat{T} = \\frac{N_1 + N_2}{C_1 + C_2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ \\hat{T} = \\frac{N_1 + N_2}{p_1(1+q)R_1 A_{\\mathrm{eff}} + p_2(1+q)R_2 A_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nWe can factor out the common terms in the denominator to obtain the final expression for the estimator:\n$$ \\hat{T} = \\frac{N_1 + N_2}{(1+q)A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1 R_1 + p_2 R_2)} $$\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Total mapped area: $A_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.20 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{2}$\n- Usable coverage fraction: $g = 0.85$\n- Observed counts: $N_1 = 410$, $N_2 = 68$\n- Detection probabilities: $p_1 = 0.92$, $p_2 = 0.99$\n- Secondary-to-primary ratio: $q = 0.20$\n- Primary-production rates: $R_1 = 2.10 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$, $R_2 = 3.10 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = g A_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.85 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{2}) = 1.02 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{2} $$\nNext, we compute the terms in the estimator formula.\nTotal observed crater count:\n$$ N_1 + N_2 = 410 + 68 = 478 $$\nThe secondary crater enhancement factor:\n$$ 1+q = 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 $$\nThe weighted sum of production rates, adjusted for detection probability:\n$$ p_1 R_1 + p_2 R_2 = (0.92)(2.10 \\times 10^{-4}) + (0.99)(3.10 \\times 10^{-5}) \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1} $$\n$$ p_1 R_1 = 1.932 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1} $$\n$$ p_2 R_2 = 0.3069 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1} $$\n$$ p_1 R_1 + p_2 R_2 = (1.932 + 0.3069) \\times 10^{-4} = 2.2389 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1} $$\nNow, we combine these parts into the denominator of the estimator for $\\hat{T}$:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (1+q)A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1 R_1 + p_2 R_2) $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (1.20) \\times (1.02 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{2}) \\times (2.2389 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 1.20 \\times 1.02 \\times 2.2389 \\times 10^{2} \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1} \\approx 274.04136 \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we calculate the estimated age $\\hat{T}$:\n$$ \\hat{T} = \\frac{478}{274.04136 \\ \\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}} \\approx 1.7442646 \\ \\mathrm{Gyr} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ \\hat{T} \\approx 1.744 \\ \\mathrm{Gyr} $$",

The team used a “buffered, center-in” counting strategy to mitigate edge effects and partial craters at the ROI boundary: for each diameter bin with lower bound $D_{\\min}$, they considered only crater centers lying within the interior subset of the ROI at points whose Euclidean distance to the ROI boundary is at least $r = D_{\\min}/2$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard principles of planetary science (crater counting), mathematically well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three tasks. We will address them sequentially.\n\n**Task 1: Derive the effective counting area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(D_{\\min})$**\n\nThe Region of Interest (ROI) is a rectangle of width $W$ and height $H$. Let us define a coordinate system such that the ROI occupies the region $0 \\leq x \\leq W$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq H$. The boundary of the ROI is composed of four line segments: $x=0$, $x=W$, $y=0$, and $y=H$.\n\nThe \"buffered, center-in\" counting strategy for a diameter bin with lower bound $D_{\\min}$ requires that the center of any counted crater, $(x, y)$, must be located at a Euclidean distance of at least $r = D_{\\min}/2$ from the ROI boundary.\n\nThe distance from an interior point $(x, y)$ to the four boundary lines are:\n- Distance to $x=0$ is $x$.\n- Distance to $x=W$ is $W-x$.\n- Distance to $y=0$ is $y$.\n- Distance to $y=H$ is $H-y$.\n\nThe condition that the point is at least a distance $r$ from the boundary means it must satisfy all four inequalities simultaneously:\n$x \\geq r$\n$W-x \\geq r \\implies x \\leq W-r$\n$y \\geq r$\n$H-y \\geq r \\implies y \\leq H-r$\n\nThese inequalities define a new, smaller, interior rectangle. The range for the $x$-coordinate is $[r, W-r]$, and the range for the $y$-coordinate is $[r, H-r]$.\nThe width of this effective counting region is $(W-r) - r = W - 2r$.\nThe height of this effective counting region is $(H-r) - r = H - 2r$.\n\nThe effective counting area, $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the product of its width and height:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (W - 2r)(H - 2r) $$\nThe problem states that the buffer distance is $r = D_{\\min}/2$. Substituting this into the area expression gives the effective area as a function of the minimum diameter $D_{\\min}$ for a given bin:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(D_{\\min}) = (W - 2(D_{\\min}/2))(H - 2(D_{\\min}/2)) $$\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(D_{\\min}) = (W - D_{\\min})(H - D_{\\min}) $$\nThis formula is valid as long as $W > D_{\\min}$ and $H > D_{\\min}$, which is true for all bins in this problem.\n\n**Task 2: Derive the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for the age $t$**\n\nThe expected number of craters, $d\\mu$, forming per unit time per unit area in an infinitesimal diameter range $[D, D+dD]$ is given by the differential production function $\\phi(D)$.

The observation completeness (detection efficiency) is constant in each bin with $\\eta_{1} = 0.9$, $\\eta_{2} = 0.8$, and $\\eta_{3} = 0.6$, and preservation is assumed to be unity in all bins. Assume crater counts are unsaturated and that resurfacing is negligible over the timescales considered.\n\nLet $T$ denote the unknown surface age in gigayears (gigayears (Gyr)). Adopt a Gamma prior for $T$ with shape $a = 2$ and rate $b = 0.5$ (so that the prior density is proportional to $T^{a-1} \\exp(-b T)$ for $T > 0$). Using the fundamental properties of the Poisson process and Bayes’ rule, derive the posterior distribution for $T$ from first principles and compute the posterior mean of $T$.\n\nRound your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in gigayears (Gyr). The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of information. It is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the posterior mean of the surface age $T$, given crater counts in three diameter bins. We will use Bayesian inference, which combines the likelihood of the observed data with a prior distribution for the parameter $T$.\n\nFirst, we determine the expected number of craters, $\\lambda_i(T)$, in each bin $i$ as a function of the surface age $T$. The problem states that this is the product of the surface area $A$, the observation completeness $\\eta_i$, the age $T$, and the integrated crater production function over the bin's diameter range $[D_{i, \\text{min}}, D_{i, \\text{max}}]$. The differential production function is given as $\\phi(D) = k D^{-q}$, with $k = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ km$^{-1}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ and $q=2$.\n\nThe integrated production function for bin $i$ is:\n$$ C_i = \\int_{D_{i, \\text{min}}}^{D_{i, \\text{max}}} \\phi(D) \\,dD = \\int_{D_{i, \\text{min}}}^{D_{i, \\text{max}}} k D^{-2} \\,dD $$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$ C_i = \\left[ -k D^{-1} \\right]_{D_{i, \\text{min}}}^{D_{i, \\text{max}}} = k \\left( \\frac{1}{D_{i, \\text{min}}} - \\frac{1}{D_{i, \\text{max}}} \\right) $$\nWe can now calculate $C_i$ for each of the three bins:\nFor bin $1$ ($[1, 2]$ km):\n$$ C_1 = k \\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{k}{2} $$\nFor bin $2$ ($[2, 5]$ km):\n$$ C_2 = k \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{5} \\right) = k \\left( \\frac{5 - 2}{10} \\right) = \\frac{3k}{10} $$\nFor bin $3$ ($[5, 10]$ km):\n$$ C_3 = k \\left( \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{10} \\right) = k \\left( \\frac{2 - 1}{10} \\right) = \\frac{k}{10} $$\n\nThe expected number of craters in bin $i$ is $\\lambda_i(T) = A \\eta_i C_i T$. It is convenient to define a constant rate coefficient $\\Lambda_i = A \\eta_i C_i$, such that $\\lambda_i(T) = \\Lambda_i T$. The units of $\\Lambda_i$ are inverse time (Gyr$^{-1}$).\n\nCrater formation is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process. The probability of observing $k_i$ craters in bin $i$, given the expected count $\\lambda_i(T)$, is described by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$ P(k_i | T) = \\frac{(\\lambda_i(T))^{k_i} \\exp(-\\lambda_i(T))}{k_i!} = \\frac{(\\Lambda_i T)^{k_i} \\exp(-\\Lambda_i T)}{k_i!} $$\nSince the counts in disjoint bins are independent, the total likelihood of observing the set of counts $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3\\}$ is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$ L(T) = P(k_1, k_2, k_3 | T) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} P(k_i | T) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{(\\Lambda_i T)^{k_i} \\exp(-\\Lambda_i T)}{k_i!} $$\nFor the purpose of finding the posterior distribution for $T$, we can treat any factors not depending on $T$ as part of the normalization constant. The likelihood is therefore proportional to:\n$$ L(T) \\propto \\prod_{i=1}^{3} T^{k_i} \\exp(-\\Lambda_i T) = T^{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} k_i} \\exp\\left(-T \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Lambda_i\\right) $$\n\nThe prior distribution for $T$ is given as a Gamma distribution, $T \\sim \\text{Gamma}(a, b)$, with shape $a=2$ and rate $b=0.5$ Gyr$^{-1}$. The prior probability density function is:\n$$ p(T) \\propto T^{a-1} \\exp(-bT) $$\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability density for $T$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$ p(T | k_1, k_2, k_3) \\propto L(T) \\cdot p(T) $$\n$$ p(T | k_1, k_2, k_3) \\propto \\left( T^{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} k_i} \\exp\\left(-T \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Lambda_i\\right) \\right) \\cdot \\left( T^{a-1} \\exp(-bT) \\right) $$\nCombining the terms involving $T$:\n$$ p(T | k_1, k_2, k_3) \\propto T^{a - 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} k_i} \\exp\\left(-T \\left(b + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Lambda_i\\right)\\right) $$\nThis expression has the functional form of a Gamma distribution. Thus, the posterior distribution is also a Gamma distribution, $T | \\{k_i\\} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(a', b')$, with updated parameters:\nPosterior shape: $a' = a + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} k_i$\nPosterior rate: $b' = b + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Lambda_i$\n\nThe mean of a Gamma distribution with shape $a'$ and rate $b'$ is $E[T] = a'/b'$. The posterior mean of $T$ is therefore:\n$$ E[T | k_1, k_2, k_3] = \\frac{a'}{b'} = \\frac{a + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} k_i}{b + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\Lambda_i} $$\nWe now substitute the numerical values provided.\nThe sum of observed craters is $\\sum k_i = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 88 + 51 + 13 = 152$.\nThe prior parameters are $a=2$ and $b=0.5$ Gyr$^{-1}$.\nThe area is $A = 5 \\times 10^5$ km$^2$, and the production function parameter is $k = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ km$^{-1}$ Gyr$^{-1}$.\nThe rate coefficients $\\Lambda_i = A \\eta_i C_i$ are:\n$$ \\Lambda_1 = A \\eta_1 \\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right) = (5 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (0.9) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^{-4}}{2}\\right) = 45 \\text{ Gyr}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_2 = A \\eta_2 \\left(\\frac{3k}{10}\\right) = (5 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (0.8) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3 \\cdot 2 \\times 10^{-4}}{10}\\right) = 24 \\text{ Gyr}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Lambda_3 = A \\eta_3 \\left(\\frac{k}{10}\\right) = (5 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (0.6) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^{-4}}{10}\\right) = 6 \\text{ Gyr}^{-1} $$\nThe sum of the rate coefficients is $\\sum \\Lambda_i = 45 + 24 + 6 = 75$ Gyr$^{-1}$.\n\nThe posterior parameters are:\n$$ a' = 2 + 152 = 154 $$\n$$ b' = 0.5 + 75 = 75.5 \\text{ Gyr}^{-1} $$\nThe posterior mean age is:\n$$ E[T | k_1, k_2, k_3] = \\frac{154}{75.5} \\text{ Gyr} \\approx 2.039735 \\text{ Gyr} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the posterior mean age is $2.040$ Gyr.",
