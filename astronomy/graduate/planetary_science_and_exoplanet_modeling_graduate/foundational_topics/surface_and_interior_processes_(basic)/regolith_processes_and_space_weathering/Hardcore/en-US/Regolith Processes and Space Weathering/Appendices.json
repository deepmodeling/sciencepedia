The idealizations are explicitly stated and serve to create a solvable, introductory-level physics problem. The problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, a general expression for the implanted dose is derived. Second, the numerical values for the dose and the volumetric concentration are calculated.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Implanted Dose**\n\nThe problem defines particle flux, $F$, as the number of particles crossing a unit area per unit time. Given that the flux is constant in time and spatially uniform, the total number of ions, $N$, incident on a surface area $A$ over an exposure duration $t$ is given by the product of flux, area, and time:\n$$\nN = F \\cdot A \\cdot t\n$$\nThe problem states that the sticking probability is unity, and sputter erosion is negligible. This means that every ion that is incident on the surface is implanted and retained. Therefore, the total number of implanted ions is equal to the total number of incident ions, $N$.\n\nThe implanted dose, which we will denote as $D_{implanted}$, is defined as the total number of implanted ions per unit area.\n$$\nD_{implanted} = \\frac{N}{A}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N$ into the definition of dose, we obtain the general expression for the implanted dose in terms of flux and time:\n$$\nD_{implanted} = \\frac{F \\cdot A \\cdot t}{A} = F \\cdot t\n$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of the implanted dose using the provided values $F = 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{ions\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ and $t = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\nD_{implanted} = (10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\cdot (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 10^{12+6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}} = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe implanted dose is $10^{18}$ ions per square meter.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Volumetric Concentration**\n\nThe volumetric concentration, $C$, is the number of implanted ions per unit volume. The problem states that all implanted ions are retained and uniformly distributed within a surface layer of thickness $d$.\n\nThe total number of ions implanted over an area $A$ is $N = D_{implanted} \\cdot A$. The volume, $V$, in which these ions are contained is the product of the area $A$ and the thickness $d$:\n$$\nV = A \\cdot d\n$$\nThe volumetric concentration $C$ is thus:\n$$\nC = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{D_{implanted} \\cdot A}{A \\cdot d} = \\frac{D_{implanted}}{d}\n$$\nTo calculate the numerical value of the concentration, we must use consistent units. The dose $D_{implanted}$ is in units of $\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$, so the thickness $d$ must be converted to meters.\nThe given thickness is $d = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We convert this to meters:\n$$\nd = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNow we can compute the concentration $C$ using the calculated dose $D_{implanted} = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ and the thickness $d = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\nC = \\frac{10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}}{1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 1 \\times 10^{18 - (-7)}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} = 1 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}\n$$\nThe resulting volumetric concentration is $1 \\times 10^{25}$ ions per cubic meter.\n\nThe two final numerical values are the implanted dose, $1 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{ions\\,m^{-2}}$, and the volumetric concentration, $1 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{ions\\,m^{-3}}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the diurnal thermal skin depth, $\\delta$, in a planetary regolith, modeled as a semi-infinite half-space. The derivation must start from the principles of energy conservation and Fourier's law of heat conduction.\n\nFirst, we derive the one-dimensional heat equation. Consider a small cylindrical volume element of the regolith with cross-sectional area $A$ and thickness $dz$, oriented with its axis along the depth direction $z$. The internal energy $U$ of this element is given by $dU = m c T$, where $m$ is the mass, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $T(z, t)$ is the temperature. The mass is $m = \\rho V = \\rho A dz$, where $\\rho$ is the bulk density. Thus, the internal energy is $dU = \\rho A c T dz$. The rate of change of internal energy in this volume element is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(dU) = \\rho A c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} dz\n$$\nAccording to the principle of energy conservation, this rate of change must equal the net rate of heat flow into the volume. Fourier's law of heat conduction states that the heat flux $q$ (energy per unit area per unit time) is proportional to the negative temperature gradient: $q = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Since heat flow is one-dimensional (along $z$), the rate of heat flowing into the element at depth $z$ is $Q_{in} = A q(z) = -A k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z}$. The rate of heat flowing out at depth $z+dz$ is $Q_{out} = A q(z+dz) = -A k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z+dz}$.\n\nThe net rate of heat flow into the element is $Q_{net} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}$:\n$$\nQ_{net} = -A k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z} - \\left(-A k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z+dz}\\right) = A k \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z+dz} - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z} \\right)\n$$\nFor an infinitesimally small $dz$, the term in the parenthesis is the definition of the second partial derivative with respect to $z$ multiplied by $dz$:\n$$\nQ_{net} \\approx A k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2} dz\n$$\nEquating the rate of change of internal energy with the net heat flow (and assuming no internal heat sources):\n$$\n\\rho A c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} dz = A k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2} dz\n$$\nDividing by $\\rho A c dz$, we obtain the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nWe define the thermal diffusivity, $\\kappa = \\frac{k}{\\rho c}$, so the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the surface temperature is forced by a sinusoidal oscillation. Let the temperature at any depth $z$ and time $t$ be represented as $T(z, t)$. It is convenient to work with complex variables. Let the surface temperature be $T(0, t) = T_{avg} + \\Delta T_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$, where $T_{avg}$ is the average temperature, $\\Delta T_0$ is the amplitude of the oscillation at the surface, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The complex representation of this boundary condition is $T_c(0, t) = T_{avg} + \\Delta T_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$. We seek a solution of the form $T_c(z, t) = T_{avg} + \\theta_c(z, t)$, where $\\theta_c(z, t)$ is a complex function representing the oscillating part of the temperature. Substituting this into the heat equation, we find that $\\theta_c(z, t)$ must also satisfy the heat equation.\n\nWe look for a solution of the form $\\theta_c(z, t) = f(z) \\exp(i\\omega t)$, which represents a wave of frequency $\\omega$ propagating in the $z$ direction. Substituting this into the heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [f(z) \\exp(i\\omega t)] = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} [f(z) \\exp(i\\omega t)]\n$$\n$$\ni\\omega f(z) \\exp(i\\omega t) = \\kappa \\frac{d^2f}{dz^2} \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nThis simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation for $f(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dz^2} - \\frac{i\\omega}{\\kappa} f(z) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $f(z) = C_1 \\exp(\\gamma z) + C_2 \\exp(-\\gamma z)$, where $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\kappa}$. We can find $\\gamma$ by noting that $i = \\exp(i\\pi/2)$, so $\\sqrt{i} = \\exp(i\\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\kappa}} \\sqrt{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}} (1+i)\n$$\nThe solution for $\\theta_c(z, t)$ is thus:\n$$\n\\theta_c(z, t) = [C_1 \\exp(\\gamma z) + C_2 \\exp(-\\gamma z)] \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nWe apply two boundary conditions. First, for a semi-infinite medium, the temperature fluctuations must remain bounded as $z \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp(\\gamma z) = \\exp(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z) \\exp(i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z)$ grows exponentially with $z$, which is unphysical. Therefore, its coefficient must be zero, $C_1 = 0$.\nThe second boundary condition is at the surface, $z=0$, where the oscillating part of the temperature has amplitude $\\Delta T_0$. So, $\\theta_c(0, t) = \\Delta T_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$.\n$$\n\\theta_c(0, t) = C_2 \\exp(0) \\exp(i\\omega t) = C_2 \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nComparing with the boundary condition gives $C_2 = \\Delta T_0$. The solution for the complex temperature oscillation is:\n$$\n\\theta_c(z, t) = \\Delta T_0 \\exp(-\\gamma z) \\exp(i\\omega t) = \\Delta T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}(1+i)z\\right) \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_c(z, t) = \\Delta T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z\\right) \\exp\\left(i\\left(\\omega t - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe physical temperature oscillation is the real part of $\\theta_c(z, t)$:\n$$\n\\theta(z, t) = \\text{Re}[\\theta_c(z, t)] = \\Delta T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z\\right) \\cos\\left(\\omega t - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z\\right)\n$$\nThe amplitude of the temperature oscillation at depth $z$ is $A(z) = \\Delta T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}z\\right)$. The thermal skin depth $\\delta$ is defined as the e-folding depth where the amplitude decays to $\\exp(-1)$ of its surface value $A(0) = \\Delta T_0$.\n$$\nA(\\delta) = A(0) \\exp(-1) \\implies \\Delta T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}\\delta\\right) = \\Delta T_0 \\exp(-1)\n$$\nComparing the exponents gives:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\kappa}}\\delta = 1 \\implies \\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\kappa}{\\omega}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\kappa = k / (\\rho c)$, we arrive at the desired expression for the thermal skin depth:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k}{\\rho c \\omega}}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate $\\delta$ for the given parameters: $P=12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $k=0.02\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $\\rho=1500\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, and $c=700\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nFirst, we convert the period $P$ to SI units (seconds) and find the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n$$\nP = 12\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s\\,h^{-1}} = 43200\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{P} = \\frac{2\\pi}{43200}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nNow we substitute these values into the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (0.02\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}{(1500\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (700\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{43200}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\\right)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.04}{(1.05 \\times 10^6) \\times (\\frac{2\\pi}{43200})}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.04 \\times 43200}{1.05 \\times 10^6 \\times 2\\pi}}\\,\\mathrm{m} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{2.1 \\times 10^6 \\pi}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1728}{6597344.57}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00026191}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.0161838\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding the final result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\delta \\approx 0.0162\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThis corresponds to a thermal skin depth of approximately $1.62$ centimeters.",

The equation for the total density becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = F \\left( \\sum_i I_i p_i - (1-r) \\sum_i Y_i x_i \\right)\n$$\n\nWe are interested in the evolution of the composition fractions, $x_i = N_i/N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation with respect to time $t$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left(\\frac{N_i}{N_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{N_i}{N_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} - x_i \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state composition, which is defined by the condition $\\mathrm{d}x_i/\\mathrm{d}t = 0$. This implies:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = x_i \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the derivatives:\n\n$$\nF I_i p_i - (1-r) F Y_i x_i + G(s_i - x_i) = x_i \\left[ F \\left( \\sum_j I_j p_j - (1-r) \\sum_j Y_j x_j \\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nThe steady-state composition fractions are denoted by $x_i^\\star$. Dividing the entire equation by the solar wind flux $F$ and defining the normalized mixing rate $\\gamma = G/F$, we obtain a system of equations for $x_i^\\star$ that is independent of the absolute value of $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n\n$$\nI_i p_i - (1-r) Y_i x_i^\\star + \\gamma(s_i - x_i^\\star) = x_i^\\star \\left( \\sum_j I_j p_j - (1-r) \\sum_j Y_j x_j^\\star \\right)\n$$\n\nLet's define the average implantation yield $\\bar{I} = \\sum_j I_j p_j$ and the surface-averaged sputter yield $\\bar{Y}(x^\\star) = \\sum_j Y_j x_j^\\star$. The equation simplifies to:\n\n$$\nI_i p_i + \\gamma s_i - \\left[(1-r) Y_i + \\gamma\\right] x_i^\\star = x_i^\\star \\left( \\bar{I} - (1-r) \\bar{Y}(x^\\star) \\right)\n$$\n\nRearranging to solve for $x_i^\\star$:\n\n$$\nI_i p_i + \\gamma s_i = x_i^\\star \\left[ (1-r) Y_i + \\gamma + \\bar{I} - (1-r) \\bar{Y}(x^\\star) \\right]\n$$\n\nLet the term in the brackets be the common denominator term $K(x^\\star)$:\n\n$$\nK(x^\\star) = (1-r) Y_i + \\gamma + \\bar{I} - (1-r) \\sum_j Y_j x_j^\\star\n$$\n\nThis can be rewritten to separate the $i$-dependent part from the common part:\n\n$$\nK(x^\\star) = (1-r) (Y_i - \\bar{Y}(x^\\star)) + \\gamma + \\bar{I}\n$$\n\nSo, for each species $i$, we have:\n\n$$\nx_i^\\star = \\frac{I_i p_i + \\gamma s_i}{(1-r) (Y_i - \\sum_j Y_j x_j^\\star) + \\gamma + \\sum_j I_j p_j}\n$$\n\nThis is a system of three coupled, nonlinear algebraic equations for the three unknowns $x_{\\mathrm{O}}^\\star$, $x_{\\mathrm{Si}}^\\star$, and $x_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\star$. Due to the constraint $\\sum_i x_i = 1$, only two of these equations are independent. We can select two equations, for instance for $i=\\mathrm{O}$ and $i=\\mathrm{Si}$, and use the constraint $x_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\star = 1 - x_{\\mathrm{O}}^\\star - x_{\\mathrm{Si}}^\\star$ to create a system of two coupled nonlinear equations in two variables.\n\nLet $x_1 = x_{\\mathrm{O}}^\\star$ and $x_2 = x_{\\mathrm{Si}}^\\star$. Then $x_3 = x_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\star = 1 - x_1 - x_2$. The system to solve is:\n$$\nf_1(x_1, x_2) = x_1 \\left( (1-r) Y_1 + K(x_1, x_2) \\right) - (I_1 p_1 + \\gamma s_1) = 0\n$$\n$$\nf_2(x_1, x_2) = x_2 \\left( (1-r) Y_2 + K(x_1, x_2) \\right) - (I_2 p_2 + \\gamma s_2) = 0\n$$\nwhere $K(x_1, x_2) = \\gamma + \\bar{I} - (1-r)(Y_1 x_1 + Y_2 x_2 + Y_3 (1 - x_1 - x_2))$.\n\nThis system is quadratic in $x_1$ and $x_2$ and is best solved using a numerical root-finding algorithm. The initial guess for the solver can be based on the subsurface composition $\\{s_i\\}$.\n\nThe implementation will define a function representing this system and use `scipy.optimize.root` to find the solution $(x_1, x_2)$, from which $x_3$ is computed. This procedure is repeated for each test case.",
