This practice explores the Arrhenius relationship, a fundamental principle from materials science that governs this temperature dependence in thermally activated processes like mantle creep. By calculating the viscosity contrast across a typical temperature range found in the upper mantle, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for why the cold outer thermal boundary layer of a planet forms a strong, brittle lithosphere capable of moving over the much weaker, hotter asthenosphere below .",
