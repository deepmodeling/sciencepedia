The application to basaltic lava flow in a tube-like channel on a super-Earth is a scientifically plausible scenario in planetary science. The given physical properties are realistic for basaltic lava. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear physical situation, the necessary governing physical principles (momentum balance), all required parameters, and well-defined boundary conditions, leading to a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and unambiguous scientific language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe starting point is the steady-state momentum balance equation for an incompressible Newtonian fluid, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation under steady conditions:\n$$ \\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{f}_b $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{f}_b$ is the body force per unit volume.\n\nWe apply the conditions given in the problem statement to simplify this equation.\n1.  The flow is steady, so time derivatives are zero.\n2.  The flow is fully developed and unidirectional along the $x$-axis. This implies the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = (u(y, z), 0, 0)$.\n3.  The channel width $b$ is much larger than the gap $2h$, so we can neglect sidewall effects and assume the flow is two-dimensional in the $x$-$y$ plane. Thus, the velocity profile depends only on $y$, so $\\mathbf{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$.\n4.  The incompressibility condition, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$, gives $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$, which is consistent with fully developed flow where the velocity profile does not change along the flow direction.\n5.  With $\\mathbf{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$, the advective term $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$ becomes $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\mathbf{i} = 0$.\n6.  The viscous term simplifies: $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} = \\eta \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\mathbf{i} = \\eta \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} \\mathbf{i}$.\n7.  The body force is gravity, $\\mathbf{f}_b = \\rho \\mathbf{g}_p$. The gravitational acceleration vector $\\mathbf{g}_p$ points vertically downward. In the inclined coordinate system, it has a component $g_p \\sin\\theta$ along the positive $x$-direction (downslope) and a component $-g_p \\cos\\theta$ along the $y$-direction. Thus, $\\mathbf{f}_b = (\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta, -\\rho g_p \\cos\\theta, 0)$.\n\nSubstituting these simplified terms into the vector momentum equation gives:\n$$ 0 = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2}\\mathbf{i} + (\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta, -\\rho g_p \\cos\\theta, 0) $$\nThis vector equation can be decomposed into its scalar components:\n$x$-component: $0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\eta \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} + \\rho g_p \\sin\\theta$\n$y$-component: $0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} - \\rho g_p \\cos\\theta$\n$z$-component: $0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$\n\nThe condition of \"no imposed pressure gradient along $x$\" implies that the flow is driven entirely by gravity. This means the pressure gradient in the direction of flow, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, is zero.\nWith $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0$, the $x$-momentum equation becomes a simple ordinary differential equation for $u(y)$:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} + \\rho g_p \\sin\\theta = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{\\eta} $$\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$. The first integration yields:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{\\eta} y + C_1 $$\nThe second integration gives the general form of the velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions. The problem states the no-slip boundary condition applies at the two rigid plates, which are located at $y = h$ and $y = -h$.\n1.  $u(h) = 0$: $0 = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} h^2 + C_1 h + C_2$\n2.  $u(-h) = 0$: $0 = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} (-h)^2 - C_1 h + C_2 = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} h^2 - C_1 h + C_2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $0 = 2 C_1 h$, which implies $C_1 = 0$. This is expected, as the symmetric geometry and boundary conditions dictate a symmetric (even) velocity profile. Substituting $C_1 = 0$ into the first equation gives:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} h^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} h^2 $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the expression for $u(y)$, we obtain the velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = -\\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} y^2 + \\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} h^2 $$\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} (h^2 - y^2) $$\nThis is a parabolic velocity profile with its maximum at the center of the channel ($y=0$).\n\nNext, we compute the volumetric flux $Q$. It is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the channel, which is from $y=-h$ to $y=h$ and of width $b$.\n$$ Q = \\int_{A} u(y) dA = \\int_0^b \\int_{-h}^h u(y) dy dz = b \\int_{-h}^h u(y) dy $$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $u(y)$:\n$$ Q = b \\int_{-h}^h \\frac{\\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} (h^2 - y^2) dy $$\nWe can factor out the constants:\n$$ Q = \\frac{b \\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} \\int_{-h}^h (h^2 - y^2) dy $$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$ \\int_{-h}^h (h^2 - y^2) dy = \\left[ h^2y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h}^h = \\left( h^3 - \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right) - \\left( -h^3 - \\frac{(-h)^3}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} h^3 \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{2}{3} h^3 \\right) = \\frac{4}{3} h^3 $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{b \\rho g_p \\sin\\theta}{2\\eta} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} h^3 \\right) = \\frac{2 b \\rho g_p h^3 \\sin\\theta}{3 \\eta} $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the volumetric flux.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values to compute $Q$:\n- $\\rho = 2.90 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $\\eta = 3.00 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$\n- $g_{p} = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $\\theta = 4.00\\,\\mathrm{degrees}$\n- $h = 0.400\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $b = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$ Q = \\frac{2 (10.0\\,\\mathrm{m}) (2.90 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (12.0\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) (0.400\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 \\sin(4.00^\\circ)}{3 (3.00 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s})} $$\nThe sine of the angle is $\\sin(4.00^\\circ) \\approx 0.069756$.\n$$ Q = \\frac{2 \\times 10.0 \\times 2900 \\times 12.0 \\times (0.400)^3 \\times 0.069756}{3 \\times 30.0} \\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{20.0 \\times 2900 \\times 12.0 \\times 0.0640 \\times 0.069756}{90.0} \\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{44544 \\times 0.069756}{90.0} \\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{3107.249...}{90.0} \\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ Q = 34.5249... \\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThe input values are given to three significant figures.

The physical principles invoked—Newtonian fluid dynamics and heat conduction—are fundamental. The provided parameters for an icy satellite are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary data and a clear set of simplifying assumptions (e.g., neglecting latent heat) required to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and formal. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be formulated.\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum dynamic viscosity, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}}$, that allows a cryolava flow to travel a distance $L$ before it freezes solid. This involves two competing processes: the flow of the cryolava, governed by its viscosity, and its cooling, governed by heat conduction. The flow can reach the specified length $L$ only if the time it takes to travel this distance is less than or equal to the time it takes for the flow to freeze. The maximum viscosity corresponds to the case where the travel time equals the freezing time.\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic timescale for the cryolava to freeze. The problem states that freezing is controlled by conductive heat loss into the substrate. The timescale for thermal diffusion, $\\tau_c$, over a characteristic length scale, in this case the flow thickness $h$, is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{h^2}{\\kappa}\n$$\nThis timescale represents the time available for the lava to flow before it solidifies. The problem's assumption to neglect latent heat simplifies the freezing process to this single conductive cooling timescale. Let's designate this as the freezing time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}} = \\frac{h^2}{\\kappa}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}} = \\frac{(1.3\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.69}{1.3 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.3 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis is the total time the cryolava has to flow.\n\nNext, we derive the average velocity of the cryolava flow. We model the flow as a sheet of a Newtonian fluid of thickness $h$ on a slope with angle $\\alpha$. Let's establish a coordinate system with the $x$-axis pointing downslope, parallel to the substrate, and the $z$-axis perpendicular to the substrate, pointing upwards into the flow. The base of the flow is at $z=0$ and the free surface is at $z=h$.\n\nFor steady, uniform, laminar flow, the momentum equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to a balance between the gravitational driving force and the viscous retarding force. The component of gravitational acceleration parallel to the slope is $g \\sin(\\alpha)$. The balance of forces per unit volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau_{zx}}{dz} + \\rho g \\sin(\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{zx}$ is the shear stress. For a Newtonian fluid, $\\tau_{zx} = \\eta \\frac{du}{dz}$, where $u(z)$ is the velocity in the $x$-direction and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. Assuming $\\eta$ is constant, we have:\n$$\n\\eta \\frac{d^2u}{dz^2} = -\\rho g \\sin(\\alpha)\n$$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to $z$ yields:\n$$\n\\eta \\frac{du}{dz} = -\\rho g z \\sin(\\alpha) + C_1\n$$\nWe apply the boundary condition of negligible shear stress at the free surface ($z=h$), which means $\\tau_{zx}(h) = \\eta \\frac{du}{dz}\\Big|_{z=h} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = -\\rho g h \\sin(\\alpha) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = \\rho g h \\sin(\\alpha)\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back, we get the expression for the velocity gradient:\n$$\n\\eta \\frac{du}{dz} = \\rho g \\sin(\\alpha) (h - z)\n$$\nIntegrating again with respect to $z$ gives the velocity profile $u(z)$:\n$$\n\\eta u(z) = \\rho g \\sin(\\alpha) \\left(hz - \\frac{z^2}{2}\\right) + C_2\n$$\nWe apply the no-slip boundary condition at the base of the flow ($z=0$), which states $u(0)=0$.\n$$\n\\eta u(0) = 0 = \\rho g \\sin(\\alpha) (0) + C_2 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nThus, the velocity profile is:\n$$\nu(z) = \\frac{\\rho g \\sin(\\alpha)}{\\eta} \\left(hz - \\frac{z^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the distance the flow travels, we need the mean flow velocity, $\\bar{u}$, which is obtained by averaging $u(z)$ over the flow thickness $h$:\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^h u(z) dz = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^h \\frac{\\rho g \\sin(\\alpha)}{\\eta} \\left(hz - \\frac{z^2}{2}\\right) dz\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{\\rho g \\sin(\\alpha)}{\\eta h} \\left[ \\frac{hz^2}{2} - \\frac{z^3}{6} \\right]_0^h = \\frac{\\rho g \\sin(\\alpha)}{\\eta h} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{2} - \\frac{h^3}{6} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{\\rho g \\sin(\\alpha)}{\\eta h} \\left(\\frac{2h^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho g h^2 \\sin(\\alpha)}{3\\eta}\n$$\nThe flow must travel the distance $L$ within the freezing time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}}$. The maximum viscosity, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}}$, corresponds to the slowest possible flow (lowest $\\bar{u}$) that can still achieve this. Therefore, we set the travel distance equal to the product of the mean velocity and the freezing time:\n$$\nL = \\bar{u} \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\bar{u}$ (with $\\eta=\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}}$) and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}}$:\n$$\nL = \\left( \\frac{\\rho g h^2 \\sin(\\alpha)}{3\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{h^2}{\\kappa} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we can solve this equation for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{\\rho g h^4 \\sin(\\alpha)}{3 L \\kappa}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the maximum dynamic viscosity.

The language is objective and precise. The provided parameters are scientifically plausible for Pluto. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nWe establish a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, z)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the dome and $z$ is the vertical height from the substrate. The dome's surface is described by its thickness $h(r)$, so the surface is at $z=h(r)$. The dome is axisymmetric.\n\nThe problem states that the dome is \"shallow,\" which implies the shallow-slope approximation: $|\\frac{dh}{dr}| \\ll 1$. Under this approximation, the pressure at any point $(r, z)$ within the cryolava is hydrostatic and given by the weight of the material above it:\n$$ P(r, z) = \\rho g (h(r) - z) $$\nThe horizontal pressure gradient, which drives the flow, is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r} = \\rho g \\frac{dh}{dr} $$\nNote that $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r}$ is independent of depth $z$ under this approximation.\n\nWe consider the force balance on a thin, vertical, annular element of the dome between radii $r$ and $r+dr$. The horizontal force due to the pressure gradient, integrated over the volume of this element ($dV = 2\\pi r dr h(r)$), drives the material outward. This driving force must be balanced by the retarding shear stress at the base of the element.\n\nThe net radial force on the element due to the pressure is the integral of the pressure gradient force over the element's volume. Since the pressure gradient is constant with depth, this force, $dF_p$, is:\n$$ dF_p = \\left(-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r}\\right) dV = \\left(-\\rho g \\frac{dh}{dr}\\right) (2\\pi r h(r) dr) $$\nThis outward-driving force is balanced by the inward-acting basal shear force, $dF_s$, exerted by the shear stress $\\tau_b$ on the basal area $dA = 2\\pi r dr$:\n$$ dF_s = \\tau_b dA = \\tau_b (2\\pi r dr) $$\nIn quasi-static equilibrium, these forces balance: $dF_p = dF_s$.\n$$ \\left(-\\rho g \\frac{dh}{dr}\\right) (2\\pi r h(r) dr) = \\tau_b (2\\pi r dr) $$\nSimplifying, we obtain the expression for the basal shear stress, which is consistent with the problem's description of \"overburden ($\\rho g h$) times slope ($-dh/dr$)\":\n$$ \\tau_b = -\\rho g h(r) \\frac{dh}{dr} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that for a dome where height decreases with radius ($dh/dr < 0$), the shear stress $\\tau_b$ is positive, as expected.\n\nThe material ceases to flow and the dome reaches its final, stable shape when the driving stress no longer exceeds the material's yield strength. At every point, the basal shear stress must be less than or equal to the yield strength. The maximal extent is achieved when the basal shear stress is exactly equal to the yield strength, $\\tau_b = \\tau_y$.\n$$ \\tau_y = -\\rho g h \\frac{dh}{dr} $$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation for the dome's profile $h(r)$. We can solve it by integrating.\n$$ \\tau_y dr = -\\rho g h dh $$\nWe integrate this equation from the center of the dome ($r=0$) to the edge of the dome ($r=R$). The corresponding heights are from the maximum central thickness, $h(0) = H_{\\max}$, to the edge thickness, $h(R) = 0$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{R} \\tau_y dr = \\int_{H_{\\max}}^{0} -\\rho g h dh $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ \\tau_y [r]_{0}^{R} = -\\rho g \\left[\\frac{h^2}{2}\\right]_{H_{\\max}}^{0} $$\n$$ \\tau_y (R - 0) = -\\rho g \\left(\\frac{0^2}{2} - \\frac{H_{\\max}^2}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\tau_y R = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho g H_{\\max}^2 $$\nSolving for the maximum central thickness, $H_{\\max}$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$ H_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{2 \\tau_y R}{\\rho g} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\tau_y R}{\\rho g}} $$\n\n### Calculation\nWe are given the following parameters, which must be converted to standard SI units:\n-   $\\tau_y = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-1}\\ s^{-2}}$\n-   $R = 18\\ \\mathrm{km} = 18 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\rho = 920\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}$\n-   $g = 0.62\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $H_{\\max}$:\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (18 \\times 10^{3})}{920 \\times 0.62}} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.08 \\times 10^{9}}{570.4}}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{1893408.1346...}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} \\approx 1375.997\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilometers, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ H_{\\max} \\approx 1.375997\\ \\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ H_{\\max} \\approx 1.376\\ \\mathrm{km} $$",
