            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of a characteristic timescale for the vertical homogenization of a passive tracer in a planetary atmosphere. The process must begin with a formal derivation from the principle of mass conservation.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nWe begin with the continuity equation for a tracer species with number density $n_t$. For a passive tracer with no local sources or sinks in a one-dimensional vertical framework, this equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_t}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_{t,z}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nwhere $t$ is time, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, and $\\Phi_{t,z}$ is the vertical flux of the tracer.\n\nThe problem states that turbulent eddy mixing dominates. The vertical eddy diffusive flux is parameterized by an eddy diffusivity $K_{zz}$ and is proportional to the gradient of the tracer's mixing ratio, $f = n_t/n$, where $n$ is the number density of the background atmosphere. This is because turbulence mixes potential temperature and mixing ratio, not absolute temperature or density. The flux is given by a Fickian-like law:\n$$\n\\Phi_{t,z} = -K_{zz} n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSubstituting the flux into the continuity equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_t}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( K_{zz} n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right) = 0\n$$\nWe can rewrite $n_t$ as $f \\cdot n$. Assuming the background atmosphere is in a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = 0$), the time derivative becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n_t}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (f n)}{\\partial t} = n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem states that $K_{zz}$ is spatially uniform (constant with $z$). Thus, we can write:\n$$\nn \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = K_{zz} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $n$ gives the governing equation for the mixing ratio $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\frac{K_{zz}}{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right)\n$$\nThe atmosphere is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermal. The ideal gas law is $P = n k_B T$, and the hydrostatic equation is $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g = -n \\mu m_u g$, where $P$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature, $g$ is gravity, $\\mu$ is the mean molecular mass in atomic mass units, and $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit. Since $T$ is constant:\n$$\nk_B T \\frac{dn}{dz} = -n \\mu m_u g \\implies \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{dn}{dz} = -\\frac{\\mu m_u g}{k_B T}\n$$\nBy definition, the pressure scale height is $H = \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_u g}$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{dn}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{H}$. This yields the familiar barometric distribution for number density: $n(z) = n_0 \\exp(-z/H)$.\n\nSubstituting $\\frac{dn}{dz} = -n/H$ into the governing equation for $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\frac{K_{zz}}{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial z} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + n \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} \\right) = K_{zz} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{dn}{dz} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = K_{zz} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} - \\frac{1}{H} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation for the mixing ratio $f$. The $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2}$ term represents diffusion, while the $-\\frac{1}{H}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$ term represents an effective advection arising from the atmospheric density stratification.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Characteristic Timescale**\n\nA characteristic timescale, $\\tau$, for a physical process described by a differential equation can be estimated via dimensional analysis. We balance the temporal derivative with the dominant spatial derivative term. The term \"homogenization\" implies a smoothing process, which is fundamentally diffusive. The highest-order spatial derivative, the diffusion term, governs this smoothing at the smallest scales.\nLet $L$ be the characteristic vertical length scale of the tracer distribution that is to be homogenized. We can approximate the derivatives as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\tau} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta f}{L^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta f$ is the characteristic variation in the mixing ratio over the layer. By balancing the time-derivative term with the diffusion term in the governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\tau} \\sim K_{zz} \\frac{\\Delta f}{L^2}\n$$\nThis yields the characteristic timescale for vertical eddy diffusion:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{K_{zz}}\n$$\nThis is the standard definition of the diffusive timescale. It represents the approximate time required for turbulent eddies to mix a substance across a vertical distance $L$.\n\n**Step 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem specifies the layer thickness to be $L = 2H$. First, we must calculate the pressure scale height $H$.\n$$\nH = \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu m_u g}\n$$\nUsing the provided parameters:\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 220 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\mu = 28$\n- $m_u = 1.660539 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- $g = 12 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-2}}$\n\nThe mean molecular mass in kilograms is $m = \\mu m_u = 28 \\times (1.660539 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 4.6495092 \\times 10^{-26} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$\nH = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ K^{-1}}) \\times (220 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{(4.6495092 \\times 10^{-26} \\ \\mathrm{kg}) \\times (12 \\ \\mathrm{m \\ s^{-2}})} = \\frac{3.0374278 \\times 10^{-21} \\ \\mathrm{J}}{5.579411 \\times 10^{-25} \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ m \\ s^{-2}}} \\approx 5444.03 \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe thickness of the homopause region is $L = 2H \\approx 2 \\times 5444.03 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 10888.06 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the mixing timescale $\\tau$ using the derived formula and the given eddy diffusivity $K_{zz} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}}$.\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{K_{zz}} = \\frac{(2H)^2}{K_{zz}} = \\frac{4H^2}{K_{zz}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{(10888.06 \\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{100 \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.1855185 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{m^2}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}}} = 1,185,518.5 \\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nTo express this timescale in days, we use the conversion $1 \\ \\mathrm{day} = 86400 \\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{days}} = \\frac{1,185,518.5 \\ \\mathrm{s}}{86400 \\ \\mathrm{s/day}} \\approx 13.721279 \\ \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $13.7 \\ \\mathrm{days}$.\n\n**Step 4: Commentary**\n\nThe calculated vertical mixing timescale of approximately $13.7$ days provides a quantitative measure of how rapidly the bulk composition of the atmosphere is homogenized by turbulence in the region below the homopause. This timescale serves as a critical benchmark against which chemical timescales can be compared.\n\nIf a chemical species has a photochemical lifetime that is significantly longer than this mixing timescale (e.g., months or years), transport will dominate over chemical loss. As a result, the species' mixing ratio will be vertically constant, or \"well-mixed,\" throughout this atmospheric layer. Examples of such species on Earth are N$_2$O and CH$_4$.\n\nConversely, if a species has a lifetime much shorter than $13.7$ days, its vertical distribution will be determined primarily by the local balance of photochemical production and loss, and it will not be well-mixed. Its mixing ratio will exhibit significant vertical gradients.\n\nTherefore, this timescale helps delineate which chemical constituents will conform to the \"well-mixed\" assumption in models of the homosphere, and which will require explicit treatment of both chemical kinetics and transport.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the criteria of being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem statement is based on fundamental principles of atmospheric physics, namely the hydrostatic equilibrium and the Ideal Gas Law. The physical scenario of diffusive separation in a planetary thermosphere is a well-established concept. All necessary physical constants and planetary parameters are provided, and their values are scientifically plausible for a super-Earth exoplanet. The assumptions of an isothermal layer and locally constant gravity are standard and appropriate for a first-order analysis over a narrow altitude range. The problem is well-posed, as it requests a derivation followed by a calculation for which a unique solution exists. The language is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the species-specific density profile for an isothermal atmospheric layer in hydrostatic equilibrium, identify the scale height, and then compute it for atomic oxygen on a given exoplanet.\n\nWe begin with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, which describes the balance between the pressure gradient force and the gravitational force on a fluid element. For a single atmospheric species $i$ in a diffusively separated atmosphere, the partial pressure $P_i$ changes with altitude $z$ according to:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_i}{dz} = -\\rho_i(z) g(z)\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_i(z)$ is the mass density of species $i$ at altitude $z$, and $g(z)$ is the local gravitational acceleration.\n\nWe model the gas using the Ideal Gas Law, which relates the partial pressure $P_i$, number density $n_i$, and temperature $T$:\n$$\nP_i = n_i k_B T\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The mass density $\\rho_i$ is related to the number density $n_i$ and the mass of a single particle of species $i$, $m_i$, by:\n$$\n\\rho_i = n_i m_i\n$$\nSubstituting $n_i = P_i / (k_B T)$ into the mass density equation gives:\n$$\n\\rho_i = \\frac{P_i m_i}{k_B T}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\rho_i$ back into the hydrostatic equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_i}{dz} = -\\left(\\frac{P_i m_i}{k_B T}\\right) g(z)\n$$\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation. We rearrange it to separate the variables $P_i$ and $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_i}{P_i} = -\\frac{m_i g(z)}{k_B T} dz\n$$\nThe problem states that we are examining a narrow isothermal layer, so $T$ is constant. It also allows the approximation that the gravitational acceleration $g$ can be taken as constant over the local altitude range, specifically $g(z) \\approx g(z_t)$. Integrating from a reference altitude $z_0$ to an altitude $z$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{P_i(z_0)}^{P_i(z)} \\frac{dP'_i}{P'_i} = -\\frac{m_i g}{k_B T} \\int_{z_0}^{z} dz'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_i(z)}{P_i(z_0)}\\right) = -\\frac{m_i g}{k_B T} (z - z_0)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the pressure profile for species $i$:\n$$\nP_i(z) = P_i(z_0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - z_0}{\\frac{k_B T}{m_i g}}\\right)\n$$\nSince $T$ is constant, the number density profile $n_i(z) = P_i(z) / (k_B T)$ has the same exponential form:\n$$\nn_i(z) = n_i(z_0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z - z_0}{\\frac{k_B T}{m_i g}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required local species-specific exponential density profile. This profile is typically written as $n_i(z) = n_i(z_0) \\exp\\left(-(z-z_0)/H_i\\right)$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the species-dependent scale height, $H_i$:\n$$\nH_i = \\frac{k_B T}{m_i g}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the scale height is inversely proportional to the mass of the species, $m_i$. In the thermosphere, diffusive separation allows each species to establish its own scale height. A lighter species (smaller $m_i$) will have a larger scale height $H_i$, meaning its density decreases more slowly with altitude compared to a heavier species. This explains why, as altitude increases, the atmosphere transitions from being dominated by heavier species (like molecular nitrogen, $m_{\\mathrm{N}_2} = 28\\,m_u$) to lighter species (like atomic oxygen, $m_{\\mathrm{O}} = 16\\,m_u$, and eventually hydrogen).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the atomic oxygen scale height, $H_{\\mathrm{O}}$, at the transition altitude $z_t = 4.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

For consistency, we will perform calculations in SI units and convert to $\\mathrm{km^{-1}}$ at the end where necessary.\n\nThe mass difference is:\n$$ m_i - \\bar{m} = (16 - 28.97) m_u = -12.97 m_u $$\n$$ m_i - \\bar{m} = -12.97 \\times (1.660539 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\approx -2.15462 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg} $$\n\n1.  Gravitational separation term:\n    $$ - \\frac{(m_i - \\bar{m})g}{k_B T} = - \\frac{(-2.15462 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (9.2\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (420\\,\\mathrm{K})} $$\n    $$ = \\frac{1.98225 \\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{N}}{5.79873 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}} \\approx 3.4185 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}} $$\n    Converting to $\\mathrm{km^{-1}}$:\n    $$ 3.4185 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}} \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{m\\,km^{-1}} = 0.034185\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}} $$\n\n2.  Thermal diffusion term:\n    It is more direct to calculate this term using units of $\\mathrm{km^{-1}}$.\n    $$ - \\alpha_{T,i} \\frac{1}{T} \\frac{dT}{dz} = -(0.75) \\times \\frac{1}{420\\,\\mathrm{K}} \\times (4\\,\\mathrm{K\\,km^{-1}}) $$\n    $$ = - \\frac{0.75 \\times 4}{420}\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}} = - \\frac{3}{420}\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}} = - \\frac{1}{140}\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}} $$\n    $$ \\approx -0.00714286\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}} $$\n\nFinally, we sum the two contributions:\n$$ \\frac{d \\ln f_i}{dz} = (0.034185\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}}) + (-0.007143\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d \\ln f_i}{dz} \\approx 0.027042\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.0270\\,\\mathrm{km^{-1}}$. The positive sign indicates that the mixing ratio of atomic oxygen increases with altitude at this location, as the effect of gravitational separation is stronger than that of thermal diffusion.",
