            "problem": "A cold, hydrogen–helium (H–He) giant planet can be approximated by a polytropic interior. Assume a spherically symmetric, self-gravitating fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium obeying the polytropic relation $P = K \\rho^{1 + 1/n}$ with index $n = 1$, where $P$ is pressure, $\\rho$ is mass density, and $K$ is a constant that encodes thermodynamic state and composition.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a planetary structure based on a polytropic equation of state with index $n=1$. The analysis proceeds by solving the equations of stellar structure for this specific case to derive a mass-radius relationship, which is then used to calculate radii for planets of different masses.\n\nThe fundamental governing equations provided are:\n1.  The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n    $$ \\frac{dP}{dr} = - \\frac{G M(r) \\rho(r)}{r^2} $$\n2.  The equation of mass continuity:\n    $$ \\frac{dM(r)}{dr} = 4 \\pi r^2 \\rho(r) $$\n3.  The polytropic equation of state for index $n=1$:\n    $$ P = K \\rho^{1 + 1/n} = K \\rho^2 $$\nIn these equations, $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $r$ is the radial coordinate from the center, $M(r)$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $K$ is the polytropic constant.\n\nTo solve this system, we employ the Lane-Emden formalism. This involves normalizing the density and radius to dimensionless variables. We define a dimensionless function $\\theta(\\xi)$ and a dimensionless radius $\\xi$ as follows:\n$$ \\rho(r) = \\rho_c \\theta^n(\\xi) = \\rho_c \\theta(\\xi) \\quad (\\text{for } n=1) $$\n$$ r = a \\xi $$\nwhere $\\rho_c$ is the central density and $a$ is a characteristic length scale. Substituting these into the governing equations leads to the Lane-Emden equation, a second-order ordinary differential equation for $\\theta(\\xi)$.\n\nFirst, we combine the hydrostatic equilibrium and mass continuity equations by differentiating the former:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{\\rho}\\frac{dP}{dr}\\right) = -G \\frac{dM(r)}{dr} = -4\\pi G r^2\\rho $$\nNext, we substitute the polytropic relation $P = K\\rho^{1+1/n}$. The pressure gradient is $\\frac{dP}{dr} = K(1+\\frac{1}{n})\\rho^{1/n}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}$.\nFor $n=1$, this is $\\frac{dP}{dr} = 2K\\rho\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}$. The structure equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{\\rho} (2K\\rho\\frac{d\\rho}{dr})\\right) = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(2Kr^2\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right) = -4\\pi G r^2\\rho $$\nSubstituting $\\rho = \\rho_c\\theta$ and $r = a\\xi$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d}{a d\\xi}\\left(2K(a\\xi)^2 \\frac{d(\\rho_c\\theta)}{a d\\xi}\\right) = -4\\pi G (a\\xi)^2 (\\rho_c\\theta) $$\n$$ \\frac{2K\\rho_c a^2}{a^2} \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) = -4\\pi G a^2 \\xi^2 \\rho_c\\theta $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\pi G a^2}{K} \\xi^2 \\theta $$\nTo obtain the canonical form of the Lane-Emden equation, we choose the length scale $a$ such that the coefficient on the right-hand side is $1$.\n$$ a^2 = \\frac{K}{2\\pi G} \\implies a = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2\\pi G}} $$\nWith this choice, the Lane-Emden equation for $n=1$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\xi^2}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2 \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) = -\\theta $$\nThe physical solution must be finite at the center ($\\xi=0$), so we impose the boundary conditions $\\theta(0)=1$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}|_{\\xi=0}=0$. The solution satisfying these conditions is:\n$$ \\theta(\\xi) = \\frac{\\sin(\\xi)}{\\xi} $$\nThe surface of the planet, $R$, is defined by the radius where the density first becomes zero. This corresponds to the first non-trivial root of $\\theta(\\xi)$, which we denote $\\xi_1$. For $\\theta(\\xi) = \\frac{\\sin(\\xi)}{\\xi}$, this occurs when $\\sin(\\xi_1) = 0$, giving $\\xi_1 = \\pi$.\n\nThe total radius of the planet is therefore $R = a \\xi_1 = a \\pi$. Substituting the expression for $a$:\n$$ R = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{2\\pi G}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi^2 K}{2\\pi G}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi K}{2G}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the radius $R$. A key feature of this result is that $R$ depends only on the constants $K$ and $G$. It is independent of the planet's total mass $M$ or its central density $\\rho_c$. This establishes the mass-radius scaling for an $n=1$ polytrope: the radius is constant for a given $K$.\n\nThe problem states that for a mass $M=1\\,M_J$, the radius is $R=1\\,R_J$. This allows us to fix the value of the constant $K$. Let's call it $K_J$.\n$$ R_J = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi K_J}{2G}} $$\nWe are then asked to compute the radii for planets of mass $0.3\\,M_J$ and $3\\,M_J$, assuming they are described by the same physics (i.e., an $n=1$ polytrope with the same constant $K_J$).\nAccording to our derived mass-radius relation, the radius is independent of mass. Therefore, the radii of these two planets will be identical to the radius of the Jupiter-mass planet.\nRadius for $0.3\\,M_J$ planet: $R_{0.3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi K_J}{2G}} = R_J$.\nRadius for $3\\,M_J$ planet: $R_{3.0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi K_J}{2G}} = R_J$.\nExpressed in units of Jupiter radii ($R_J$) and rounded to four significant figures, both radii are $1.000$.\n\nThe problem also asks for a qualitative comparison with realistic models. The $n=1$ polytrope prediction of a mass-independent radius ($R \\propto M^0$) provides a surprisingly reasonable first approximation for the behavior of gas giant exoplanets in the mass range of roughly $0.5$ to $5$ Jupiter masses, where the observed mass-radius relationship is relatively flat.\n\nHowever, a single polytropic index is an oversimplification. The true equation of state (EOS) of a hydrogen-helium mixture is complex. The discrepancy arises because the model fails to account for the changing physics of the planetary interior as mass increases. As mass and central pressure increase, electron degeneracy pressure becomes progressively more important in supporting the planet against gravitational collapse. For very massive giant planets and brown dwarfs, the EOS approaches that of a non-relativistic, degenerate Fermi gas, for which the pressure-density relation is $P \\propto \\rho^{5/3}$. This corresponds to a polytropic index of $n = \\frac{1}{5/3 - 1} = \\frac{3}{2}$. For an $n=3/2$ polytrope, the mass-radius relation is $R \\propto M^{-1/3}$, meaning the radius decreases with increasing mass.\n\nTherefore, realistic models predict that the radius of a cold H-He planet does not remain constant. It increases with mass for low-mass planets, reaches a plateau or a maximum around a few Jupiter masses, and then decreases for higher masses as degeneracy pressure dominates. The $n=1$ model artificially represents the entire mass range with the physics of the \"plateau\" region, thus missing the turnover and subsequent contraction at higher masses. For instance, a realistic $3\\,M_J$ planet would be slightly smaller in radius than Jupiter. The physical origin of this discrepancy is the failure of the simple $P=K\\rho^2$ relation to capture the transition toward a state dominated by electron degeneracy.",

The model must be grounded in fundamental physical principles and widely accepted approximations. The target system is a sub-Neptune-like planet with total mass $M$ and observed radius $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The planet is modeled as an Earth-like rocky core of mass $M_{\\mathrm{c}}$ overlain by an isothermal hydrogen-helium envelope of mass $M_{\\mathrm{env}}$ with heavy molecule enrichment (metallicity) characterized by a mass fraction $Z_{\\mathrm{env}}$. The envelope mass fraction is defined as $f_{\\mathrm{env}} = M_{\\mathrm{env}} / M$, and the objective is to determine the minimum $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ for which the model radius $R$ equals or exceeds $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$.\n\nYour program must implement the following physics and approximations, operating strictly in International System of Units (SI):\n\n- The model includes a rocky core and a gaseous envelope. The core mass is $M_{\\mathrm{c}} = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{env}}) M$ and the envelope mass is $M_{\\mathrm{env}} = f_{\\mathrm{env}} M$.\n- The core radius $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ follows a widely used approximate mass-radius scaling for Earth-like composition: $R_{\\mathrm{c}} = R_\\oplus \\left( \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{c}}}{M_\\oplus} \\right)^\\alpha$, where $R_\\oplus$ and $M_\\oplus$ are the Earth radius and Earth mass, and $\\alpha$ is a constant exponent taken as $0.27$.\n- The envelope is treated as isothermal with temperature $T$ and obeys the Ideal Gas Law. Hydrostatic equilibrium is enforced through $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g$, where $P$ is pressure, $z$ is altitude, $\\rho$ is mass density, and $g$ is local gravitational acceleration. Combined with the Ideal Gas Law $P = \\rho R_{\\mathrm{gas}} T$ with $R_{\\mathrm{gas}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mu m_{\\mathrm{H}}}$, one obtains the exponential pressure profile $P(z) = P_{\\mathrm{b}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{H}\\right)$, where $P_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is the pressure at the base of the envelope (top of the core), and $H = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\mu m_{\\mathrm{H}} g}$ is the scale height.

The model treats the planet as a rocky core plus an isothermal ideal-gas envelope. The solution proceeds from hydrostatic equilibrium and the Ideal Gas Law, along with a mass-radius scaling for the rocky core.\n\nStep $1$ (Core radius model): Assume Earth-like composition for the core.

Note that $g = \\frac{G M}{R^2}$ with $R = R_{\\mathrm{c}} + \\Delta R$ is itself a function of the total radius, requiring iterative consistency for $R$.\n\nStep $5$ (Fixed-point iteration for radius): For a given $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ and $Z_{\\mathrm{env}}$, compute $M_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$.

Note the following qualitative behavior:\n- As $f_{\\mathrm{env}} \\to 0$, $R \\to R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and typically $R  R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ for sub-Neptune targets, because the core alone is too compact.\n- As $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ increases, the base pressure $P_{\\mathrm{b}}$ increases, enhancing $\\Delta R$, and although $R_{\\mathrm{c}}$ decreases with lower core mass, the envelope thickness generally dominates, causing $R$ to increase. Higher $Z_{\\mathrm{env}}$ increases $\\mu$, which reduces the scale height $H$, decreasing $\\Delta R$ and thus requiring a larger $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ to reach the same $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$.\n\nUse bisection on $f_{\\mathrm{env}} \\in [0, f_{\\mathrm{max}}]$ (with $f_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.5$) to find the minimum fraction such that $R(f_{\\mathrm{env}}; Z_{\\mathrm{env}}) \\ge R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. If $R(0; Z_{\\mathrm{env}}) \\ge R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, the minimum fraction is $0$. If $R(f_{\\mathrm{max}}; Z_{\\mathrm{env}})  R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, return $f_{\\mathrm{max}}$ to indicate the bracket was insufficient.\n\nStep $7$ (Units and constants): Convert $M$ and $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ from Earth units to SI using $M_\\oplus$ and $R_\\oplus$. Use:\n- $G$ for Newton's gravitational constant,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ for the Boltzmann constant,\n- $m_{\\mathrm{H}}$ for the mass of a hydrogen atom,\n- $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HHe}} = 2.3$,\n- $\\mu_Z = 18$,\n- $P_{\\mathrm{ph}} = 2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nStep $8$ (Test suite and output): Evaluate the minimum $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ for the four test cases specified:\n- Case $1$: $Z_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.0$, $T = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Case $2$: $Z_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.5$, $T = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Case $3$: $Z_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.9$, $T = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Case $4$: $Z_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.0$, $T = 400\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nRound each result to six decimal places and output as a single line in the format $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4]$, where $x_i$ are unitless decimal fractions.\n\nThis approach connects the exoplanet mass-radius relationship to atmospheric structure via hydrostatic equilibrium and the Ideal Gas Law, translates envelope metallicity into mean molecular weight effects on scale height, and employs an iterative, physically consistent radius computation combined with root-bracketing on envelope mass fraction. The model’s behavior with respect to $Z_{\\mathrm{env}}$ is physically intuitive: larger $\\mu$ reduces $H$, which raises the required $f_{\\mathrm{env}}$ to achieve a given $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The cold-temperature edge case further reduces $H$, serving as a boundary condition that increases the minimum fraction and tests algorithmic robustness.",
