I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: a symbolic derivation of the flux-density contrast ratio followed by a numerical evaluation.\n\n#### Part 1: Symbolic Derivation\n\nThe observed spectral flux density, $F_{\\lambda}$, from an unresolved source is the spectral radiance, $B_{\\lambda}$, integrated over the solid angle, $\\Omega$, subtended by the source.\n$$\nF_{\\lambda} = \\int_{\\Omega} B_{\\lambda} \\,d\\omega\n$$\nFor an isotropic blackbody, the spectral radiance $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ is uniform across the emitting surface. Since the source is unresolved, its angular size is small, and the integral simplifies to the product of the spectral radiance and the total solid angle.\n$$\nF_{\\lambda} = B_{\\lambda}(T) \\Omega\n$$\nA spherical source of radius $R$ at a distance $d$ subtends a solid angle $\\Omega$ given by the ratio of its projected area (a disk of area $\\pi R^2$) to the square of the distance.\n$$\n\\Omega = \\frac{\\pi R^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nTherefore, the spectral flux density from the object is:\n$$\nF_{\\lambda} = B_{\\lambda}(T) \\frac{\\pi R^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nWe apply this general expression to both the star ($\\star$) and the planet ($p$).\n\nFor the star:\n$$\nF_{\\star} = B_{\\lambda}(T_{\\star}) \\frac{\\pi R_{\\star}^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nFor the planet:\n$$\nF_{p} = B_{\\lambda}(T_{p}) \\frac{\\pi R_{p}^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the flux-density contrast ratio, $F_{p}/F_{\\star}$.

For any given wavelength $\\lambda$, the starlight suppression region spans the angular range from an Inner Working Angle (IWA) to an Outer Working Angle (OWA). Based on the diffraction scaling law $\\theta \\propto \\lambda/D$, this interval is given by:\n$$I(\\lambda) = [\\theta_{\\text{IWA}}(\\lambda), \\theta_{\\text{OWA}}(\\lambda)] = \\left[k_{\\min} \\frac{\\lambda}{D}, k_{\\max} \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\right]$$\n\nThe instrument operates over a spectral band of wavelengths $\\lambda$ from a minimum wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{min}}$ to a maximum wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.

This corresponds to the intersection of all monochromatic dark hole intervals $I(\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda \\in [\\lambda_{\\text{min}}, \\lambda_{\\text{max}}]$:\n$$\\theta \\in I_{\\text{eff}} = \\bigcap_{\\lambda \\in [\\lambda_{\\text{min}}, \\lambda_{\\text{max}}]} I(\\lambda) = [\\theta_{\\text{IWA,eff}}, \\theta_{\\text{OWA,eff}}]$$\n\nThe inner boundary of this intersection, $\\theta_{\\text{IWA,eff}}$, must be an angle-$\\theta$ that is greater than or equal to the IWA of *every* wavelength in the band. Since $\\theta_{\\text{IWA}}(\\lambda) = k_{\\min} \\lambda/D$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\lambda$, the most restrictive (largest) IWA occurs at the longest wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$\\theta_{\\text{IWA,eff}} = \\sup_{\\lambda \\in [\\lambda_{\\text{min}}, \\lambda_{\\text{max}}]} \\left( k_{\\min} \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\right) = k_{\\min} \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}}{D} = k_{\\min} \\frac{\\lambda_0(1+B/2)}{D} = k_{\\min}\\frac{\\lambda_0+\\Delta\\lambda/2}{D}$$\n\nConversely, the outer boundary of the intersection, $\\theta_{\\text{OWA,eff}}$, must be an angle-$\\theta$ that is less than or equal to the OWA of *every* wavelength in the band.

Starting from the above base, derive an unbiased estimator $\\hat{E}$ of the complex speckle field $E$ in terms of the measured differences $D_{a} = N_{+,a} - N_{-,a}$ and $D_{b} = N_{+,b} - N_{-,b}$, and the known probe $p$.\n2. Under the stated photon noise model, derive the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for the complex estimator as the ratio of $|E|$ to the root-mean-square error of $\\hat{E}$ in the complex plane. Express your SNR in closed form as a function of $|E|$ and $|p|$.\n3. For a scientifically plausible observing case in which the mean speckle intensity satisfies $|E|^{2} = 100$ photo-electrons per exposure and the probe intensity satisfies $|p|^{2} = 900$ photo-electrons per exposure, compute the numerical value of the SNR of the complex estimator. Round your answer to four significant figures and express it as a pure number without units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Fourier optics and statistical estimation theory as applied to high-contrast astronomical imaging. The premises are physically realistic, the terminology is precise, and the problem is mathematically well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe task is to derive an estimator for a complex electric field $E$, find its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and compute a numerical value for a specific case. The solution is structured in three parts corresponding to the three tasks.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Unbiased Estimator $\\hat{E}$**\n\nLet $E$ be the unknown complex speckle electric field and $p$ be the known complex probe field. The four measurements correspond to total fields of $E+p$, $E-p$, $E+i\\,p$, and $E-i\\,p$. The mean detected photo-electron count, denoted by $\\langle N \\rangle$, is the squared modulus of the total complex field.\n\nThe mean counts for the four exposures are:\n1.  For the field $F_{+,a} = E+p$:\n    $\\langle N_{+,a} \\rangle = |E+p|^{2} = |E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})$\n2.  For the field $F_{-,a} = E-p$:\n    $\\langle N_{-,a} \\rangle = |E-p|^{2} = |E|^{2} + |p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})$\n3.  For the field $F_{+,b} = E+i\\,p$:\n    $\\langle N_{+,b} \\rangle = |E+i\\,p|^{2} = |E|^{2} + |i\\,p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Re(E\\,(i\\,p)^{*}) = |E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Re(-i\\,E\\,p^{*})$\n    Using the identity $\\Re(-i\\,Z) = \\Im(Z)$ for any complex number $Z$, this becomes:\n    $\\langle N_{+,b} \\rangle = |E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})$\n4.  For the field $F_{-,b} = E-i\\,p$:\n    $\\langle N_{-,b} \\rangle = |E-i\\,p|^{2} = |E|^{2} + |i\\,p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Re(E\\,(i\\,p)^{*}) = |E|^{2} + |p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})$\n\nThe problem defines the measurement differences $D_{a} = N_{+,a} - N_{-,a}$ and $D_{b} = N_{+,b} - N_{-,b}$. We compute their expectation values:\n$$\n\\langle D_{a} \\rangle = \\langle N_{+,a} \\rangle - \\langle N_{-,a} \\rangle = \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})\\right) - \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})\\right) = 4\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})\n$$\n$$\n\\langle D_{b} \\rangle = \\langle N_{+,b} \\rangle - \\langle N_{-,b} \\rangle = \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})\\right) - \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})\\right) = 4\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})\n$$\nWe can construct a complex quantity from these expectations:\n$$\n\\langle D_{a} \\rangle + i\\,\\langle D_{b} \\rangle = 4\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*}) + i\\,4\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*}) = 4 \\left( \\Re(E\\,p^{*}) + i\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*}) \\right) = 4\\,E\\,p^{*}\n$$\nSince the expectation of the measurements $N$ equals the mean counts $\\langle N \\rangle$, and expectation is a linear operator, we have $\\langle D_a + i D_b \\rangle = 4 E p^*$. This suggests that $\\frac{1}{4}(D_a + i D_b)$ is an unbiased estimator for the product $E\\,p^{*}$. To estimate $E$, we divide by the known complex conjugate of the probe, $p^{*}$:\n$$\n\\hat{E} = \\frac{D_{a} + i\\,D_{b}}{4\\,p^{*}}\n$$\nThis estimator is unbiased, as its expectation value is:\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{E} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{D_{a} + i\\,D_{b}}{4\\,p^{*}} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\langle D_{a} + i\\,D_{b} \\rangle}{4\\,p^{*}} = \\frac{4\\,E\\,p^{*}}{4\\,p^{*}} = E\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**\n\nThe SNR for the complex estimator is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the true field, $|E|$, to the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the estimator, $\\mathrm{RMSE}(\\hat{E})$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{|E|}{\\mathrm{RMSE}(\\hat{E})}\n$$\nThe mean-square error (MSE) is $\\mathrm{MSE}(\\hat{E}) = \\langle |\\hat{E} - \\langle\\hat{E}\\rangle |^{2} \\rangle$. Since $\\hat{E}$ is an unbiased estimator, $\\langle\\hat{E}\\rangle = E$, and the MSE is equal to the variance of the complex random variable $\\hat{E}$, denoted $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{E})$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{E}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{D_{a} + i\\,D_{b}}{4\\,p^{*}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{|4\\,p^{*}|^{2}} \\mathrm{Var}(D_{a} + i\\,D_{b}) = \\frac{1}{16\\,|p|^{2}} \\mathrm{Var}(D_{a} + i\\,D_{b})\n$$\nThe measurements $N_{+,a}, N_{-,a}, N_{+,b}, N_{-,b}$ are statistically independent Poisson variables. Consequently, the derived quantities $D_{a} = N_{+,a} - N_{-,a}$ and $D_{b} = N_{+,b} - N_{-,b}$ are uncorrelated, as they are formed from disjoint sets of independent variables. Therefore, the variance of their complex sum is the sum of their individual variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D_{a} + i\\,D_{b}) = \\mathrm{Var}(D_{a}) + \\mathrm{Var}(D_{b})\n$$\nThe variance of a Poisson random variable is equal to its mean. For the difference of two independent variables, the variances add:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D_{a}) = \\mathrm{Var}(N_{+,a} - N_{-,a}) = \\mathrm{Var}(N_{+,a}) + \\mathrm{Var}(N_{-,a}) = \\langle N_{+,a} \\rangle + \\langle N_{-,a} \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the mean counts:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D_{a}) = \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})\\right) + \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Re(E\\,p^{*})\\right) = 2\\,|E|^{2} + 2\\,|p|^{2}\n$$\nSimilarly, for $D_b$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D_{b}) = \\mathrm{Var(N_{+,b})} + \\mathrm{Var(N_{-,b})} = \\langle N_{+,b} \\rangle + \\langle N_{-,b} \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D_{b}) = \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} + 2\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})\\right) + \\left(|E|^{2} + |p|^{2} - 2\\,\\Im(E\\,p^{*})\\right) = 2\\,|E|^{2} + 2\\,|p|^{2}\n$$\nNow we assemble the variance of $\\hat{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{E}) = \\frac{1}{16\\,|p|^{2}} \\left( (2\\,|E|^{2} + 2\\,|p|^{2}) + (2\\,|E|^{2} + 2\\,|p|^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{4\\,|E|^{2} + 4\\,|p|^{2}}{16\\,|p|^{2}} = \\frac{|E|^{2} + |p|^{2}}{4\\,|p|^{2}}\n$$\nThe RMSE is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE}(\\hat{E}) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{E})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{|E|^{2} + |p|^{2}}{4\\,|p|^{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{|E|^{2} + |p|^{2}}}{2\\,|p|}\n$$\nFinally, we write the SNR expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{|E|}{\\mathrm{RMSE}(\\hat{E})} = \\frac{|E|}{\\frac{\\sqrt{|E|^{2} + |p|^{2}}}{2\\,|p|}} = \\frac{2\\,|E|\\,|p|}{\\sqrt{|E|^{2} + |p|^{2}}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation of the SNR**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Mean speckle intensity: $|E|^{2} = 100$ photo-electrons\n- Mean probe intensity: $|p|^{2} = 900$ photo-electrons\n\nFrom these, we find the magnitudes of the fields:\n- $|E| = \\sqrt{100} = 10$\n- $|p| = \\sqrt{900} = 30$\n\nSubstituting these values into the SNR expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{2\\,(10)\\,(30)}{\\sqrt{100 + 900}} = \\frac{600}{\\sqrt{1000}} = \\frac{600}{10\\,\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{60}{\\sqrt{10}}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{60}{\\sqrt{10}} = 6\\,\\sqrt{10} \\approx 6 \\times 3.16227766 \\approx 18.97366596\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the SNR is $18.97$.",
