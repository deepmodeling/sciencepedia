Therefore, it is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived in two main stages as requested: first, determining the terminal vertical velocity, and second, solving the differential equation for the pebble's vertical position to find the settling time.\n\nLet $m$ be the mass of the pebble. The forces acting on the pebble in the vertical ($z$) direction are the vertical component of the star's gravity, $F_g$, and the gas drag force, $F_d$.\n\nThe gravitational force is given by $F_g = m g_z$. Using the provided approximation for the gravitational acceleration, we have:\n$$F_g = - m \\Omega^2 z$$\n\nThe gas drag force in the Epstein regime is given by $F_d = - \\frac{m}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} (v_p - v_g)$, where $v_p$ is the particle velocity and $v_g$ is the gas velocity. In the vertical direction, the particle velocity is $v_z = dz/dt$ and the gas is assumed to be stationary, so its vertical velocity is $0$. Therefore, the vertical drag force is:\n$$F_d = - \\frac{m}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} v_z$$\n\nNewton's second law for the pebble's vertical motion is $m \\frac{dv_z}{dt} = \\sum F_z = F_g + F_d$.\n$$m \\frac{dv_z}{dt} = -m \\Omega^2 z - \\frac{m}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} v_z$$\n\nThe problem states to neglect the particle's vertical inertia, which corresponds to the terminal velocity assumption. This is equivalent to setting the acceleration term $\\frac{dv_z}{dt}$ to $0$. This approximation is valid in the strong coupling limit where the stopping time is very short compared to the dynamical timescale ($1/\\Omega$), so the particle adjusts its velocity to the local net force almost instantaneously.\nSetting the left side to zero and cancelling the mass $m$ from all terms, we get the force balance equation:\n$$0 = - \\Omega^2 z - \\frac{1}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} v_z$$\n\nSolving for the terminal vertical velocity $v_z$ as a function of $z$:\n$$v_z = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} z$$\nThis is the first required part of the derivation. The negative sign indicates that for $z>0$, the velocity is downward, directed towards the midplane ($z=0$), as expected for settling.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part: finding the settling time. The velocity $v_z$ is by definition the rate of change of the vertical position $z$, so $v_z = \\frac{dz}{dt}$. Substituting our expression for $v_z$:\n$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = - (\\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}}) z$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $z(t)$. The term $\\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$ is constant under the problem's assumptions. We can solve this equation by separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{dz}{z} = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\, dt$$\n\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state at $t=0$ where $z(0)=H_g$ to a time $t$ where the position is $z(t)$:\n$$\\int_{z(0)}^{z(t)} \\frac{1}{z'} dz' = \\int_0^t - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\, dt'$$\n$$\\left[ \\ln(z') \\right]_{H_g}^{z(t)} = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\left[ t' \\right]_0^t$$\n$$\\ln(z(t)) - \\ln(H_g) = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{z(t)}{H_g}\\right) = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t$$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the vertical position as a function of time:\n$$z(t) = H_g \\exp(- \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t)$$\n\nThe problem defines the e-folding settling time, $t_{\\mathrm{set}}$, as the time at which the height is reduced by a factor of $e$, i.e., $z(t_{\\mathrm{set}}) = H_g / e = H_g \\exp(-1)$. We substitute this into our solution:\n$$H_g \\exp(-1) = H_g \\exp(- \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t_{\\mathrm{set}})$$\n\nCancelling $H_g$ and equating the exponents, we find:\n$$-1 = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t_{\\mathrm{set}}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{set}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}}}$$\n\nFinally, we must express this result in terms of the fundamental parameters provided: $\\Omega$, $\\rho_{g0}$, $c_s$, $\\rho_s$, and $s$. We substitute the given expression for the stopping time, $t_{\\mathrm{stop}} = \\frac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g0} c_s}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{set}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega^2 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g0} c_s} \\right)}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{set}} = \\frac{\\rho_{g0} c_s}{\\Omega^2 \\rho_s s}$$\n\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the e-folding settling time.",

It is a valid problem. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the mass growth rate, $\\frac{dM}{dt}=\\dot{M}$, in terms of the specified variables. We begin with the given formula for the accretion rate:\n$$ \\dot{M}=2 R_{\\mathrm{acc}}\\,\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{peb}}\\,v_{\\mathrm{rel}} $$\nThe problem states that the capture radius is the Hill radius, $R_{\\mathrm{acc}}=R_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and the relative velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\approx \\frac{3}{2}\\Omega R_{\\mathrm{acc}}$.

It is a standard problem in the field of planet formation theory.\n\nThe problem asks for two main components: a physical justification for the dependence of the pebble isolation mass ($M_\\mathrm{iso}$) on disk parameters, and the calculation of $M_\\mathrm{iso}$ for three specific cases.\n\nFirst, we address the physical justification. The pebble isolation mass, $M_\\mathrm{iso}$, is defined as the planet mass required to form a pressure maximum in the gas disk just exterior to the planet's orbit. This pressure maximum acts as a barrier, trapping inwardly drifting pebbles and halting their accretion onto the planet. The formation of this pressure maximum is contingent on the planet's ability to open a substantial gap in the gas density profile. The depth and width of this gap are determined by a competition between the planet's gravitational torque, which clears material from its co-orbital region, and two primary restoring mechanisms: gas pressure and turbulent viscosity.\n\n1.  **Dependence on the disk aspect ratio, $h \\equiv H/r$**: The parameter $h$ represents the ratio of the gas pressure scale height $H$ to the orbital radius $r$. A larger value of $h$ signifies a \"thicker\" or \"hotter\" disk, where thermal pressure is more significant. Gas pressure acts to resist the compression needed to form a gap. The planet's gravitational influence is confined within its Hill radius, $R_\\mathrm{H} = r (M_p / (3 M_*))^{1/3}$, where $M_p$ is the planet mass and $M_*$ is the stellar mass. For a gap to open, the planet's gravitational influence must overcome the thermal pressure of the gas. The condition for deep gap opening is often expressed as $R_\\mathrm{H} \\gtrsim H$. Substituting the definitions, we get $r (M_p / (3 M_*))^{1/3} \\gtrsim h r$, which simplifies to $M_p / M_* \\gtrsim 3 h^3$. This indicates that the mass required to open a gap scales steeply with the aspect ratio, specifically as $M_p \\propto h^3$. A physically thicker, higher-pressure disk (larger $h$) offers more resistance to gap formation, thus requiring a more massive planet to achieve pebble isolation. This explains the strong $M_\\mathrm{iso} \\propto (h/0.05)^3$ dependence in the provided empirical formula.\n\n2.  **Dependence on the turbulent viscosity parameter, $\\alpha$**: Turbulent viscosity, parameterized by the Shakura–Sunyaev parameter $\\alpha$, acts as a diffusive process that counteracts gap opening. Turbulence drives the transport of angular momentum and mass through the disk, effectively trying to refill the density gap cleared by the planet. A higher viscosity (larger $\\alpha$) corresponds to a more efficient refilling process. To overcome this stronger viscous diffusion and maintain a deep enough gap to create a pressure maximum, the planet must exert a stronger gravitational torque. The planetary torque scales with the planet's mass squared, so a more massive planet is required. Therefore, $M_\\mathrm{iso}$ must be an increasing function of $\\alpha$. The given formula includes the term $0.34 + (\\log_{10}\\alpha + 3.0)/6$. As $\\alpha$ increases, $\\log_{10}\\alpha$ increases, and consequently $M_\\mathrm{iso}$ increases, which is consistent with this physical reasoning. The logarithmic dependence is an empirical result from hydrodynamical simulations, reflecting the complex interplay between viscous and planetary torques.\n\nNext, we evaluate $M_\\mathrm{iso}$ for the three specified cases using the provided formula:\n$$\nM_\\mathrm{iso} \\approx 25\\,M_\\oplus \\left(\\frac{h}{0.05}\\right)^{3}\\left[0.34 + \\frac{\\log_{10}\\alpha + 3.0}{6}\\right]\n$$\nThe result is requested in units of Earth masses, $M_\\oplus$. We can compute the ratio $M_\\mathrm{iso}/M_\\oplus$.\n\n**Case A: $h = 0.03$, $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$**\nFirst, we compute the two main factors.\nThe aspect ratio term is $\\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.05}\\right)^3 = (0.6)^3 = 0.216$.\nThe viscosity term requires evaluating $\\log_{10}\\alpha = \\log_{10}(10^{-3}) = -3$.\nThe term in brackets is $0.34 + \\frac{-3 + 3.0}{6} = 0.34 + \\frac{0}{6} = 0.34$.\nCombining these, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{M_\\mathrm{iso, A}}{M_\\oplus} = 25 \\times 0.216 \\times 0.34 = 5.4 \\times 0.34 = 1.836\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the result is $1.836$.\n\n**Case B: $h = 0.05$, $\\alpha = 10^{-4}$**\nThe aspect ratio term is $\\left(\\frac{0.05}{0.05}\\right)^3 = 1^3 = 1$.\nThe viscosity term requires evaluating $\\log_{10}\\alpha = \\log_{10}(10^{-4}) = -4$.\nThe term in brackets is $0.34 + \\frac{-4 + 3.0}{6} = 0.34 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{0.34 \\times 6 - 1}{6} = \\frac{2.04 - 1}{6} = \\frac{1.04}{6} \\approx 0.173333...$\nCombining these, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{M_\\mathrm{iso, B}}{M_\\oplus} = 25 \\times 1 \\times \\left(\\frac{1.04}{6}\\right) = \\frac{26}{6} = \\frac{13}{3} \\approx 4.333333...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the result is $4.333$.\n\n**Case C: $h = 0.07$, $\\alpha = 10^{-2}$**\nThe aspect ratio term is $\\left(\\frac{0.07}{0.05}\\right)^3 = (1.4)^3 = 2.744$.\nThe viscosity term requires evaluating $\\log_{10}\\alpha = \\log_{10}(10^{-2}) = -2$.\nThe term in brackets is $0.34 + \\frac{-2 + 3.0}{6} = 0.34 + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{0.34 \\times 6 + 1}{6} = \\frac{2.04 + 1}{6} = \\frac{3.04}{6} \\approx 0.506666...$\nCombining these, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{M_\\mathrm{iso, C}}{M_\\oplus} = 25 \\times 2.744 \\times \\left(\\frac{3.04}{6}\\right) = 68.6 \\times \\left(\\frac{3.04}{6}\\right) = \\frac{208.544}{6} \\approx 34.757333...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the result is $34.76$.\n\nPrincipal sources of uncertainty in this model, and the validity domain of the formula, deserve comment. The expression for $M_\\mathrm{iso}$ is an empirical fit to numerical hydrodynamical simulations. As such, its coefficients carry uncertainties, and its form may vary depending on the specific code, grid resolution, and physical ingredients included in the simulations. The formula is derived assuming a simple, locally isothermal equation of state and a constant $\\alpha$-viscosity, which are significant simplifications of the complex physics of real protoplanetary disks, where radiative transfer and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are important. The formula is calibrated for typical disk parameters, roughly $h \\in [0.02, 0.1]$ and $\\alpha \\in [10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$. Outside this range, its predictions may be unreliable. For instance, for very low $\\alpha$, the logarithmic term could lead to a non-physical negative isolation mass, indicating a breakdown of the fit. Despite these limitations, the formula provides a valuable and widely used estimate for the core mass at which giant planet formation can begin.\n\nThe three calculated values are $1.836 \\, M_\\oplus$, $4.333 \\, M_\\oplus$, and $34.76 \\, M_\\oplus$.",
