The concepts of Keplerian shear, gas drag in the Epstein regime, stopping time, and vertical settling are all canonical components of this field.

Therefore, it is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived in two main stages as requested: first, determining the terminal vertical velocity, and second, solving the differential equation for the pebble's vertical position to find the settling time.\n\nLet $m$ be the mass of the pebble. The forces acting on the pebble in the vertical ($z$) direction are the vertical component of the star's gravity, $F_g$, and the gas drag force, $F_d$.\n\nThe gravitational force is given by $F_g = m g_z$. Using the provided approximation for the gravitational acceleration, we have:\n$$F_g = - m \\Omega^2 z$$\n\nThe gas drag force in the Epstein regime is given by $F_d = - \\frac{m}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} (v_p - v_g)$, where $v_p$ is the particle velocity and $v_g$ is the gas velocity. In the vertical direction, the particle velocity is $v_z = dz/dt$ and the gas is assumed to be stationary, so its vertical velocity is $0$. Therefore, the vertical drag force is:\n$$F_d = - \\frac{m}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} v_z$$\n\nNewton's second law for the pebble's vertical motion is $m \\frac{dv_z}{dt} = \\sum F_z = F_g + F_d$.\n$$m \\frac{dv_z}{dt} = -m \\Omega^2 z - \\frac{m}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} v_z$$\n\nThe problem states to neglect the particle's vertical inertia, which corresponds to the terminal velocity assumption. This is equivalent to setting the acceleration term $\\frac{dv_z}{dt}$ to $0$. This approximation is valid in the strong coupling limit where the stopping time is very short compared to the dynamical timescale ($1/\\Omega$), so the particle adjusts its velocity to the local net force almost instantaneously.\nSetting the left side to zero and cancelling the mass $m$ from all terms, we get the force balance equation:\n$$0 = - \\Omega^2 z - \\frac{1}{t_{\\mathrm{stop}}} v_z$$\n\nSolving for the terminal vertical velocity $v_z$ as a function of $z$:\n$$v_z = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} z$$\nThis is the first required part of the derivation. The negative sign indicates that for $z>0$, the velocity is downward, directed towards the midplane ($z=0$), as expected for settling.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part: finding the settling time. The velocity $v_z$ is by definition the rate of change of the vertical position $z$, so $v_z = \\frac{dz}{dt}$. Substituting our expression for $v_z$:\n$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = - (\\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}}) z$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $z(t)$. The term $\\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$ is constant under the problem's assumptions. We can solve this equation by separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{dz}{z} = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\, dt$$\n\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state at $t=0$ where $z(0)=H_g$ to a time $t$ where the position is $z(t)$:\n$$\\int_{z(0)}^{z(t)} \\frac{1}{z'} dz' = \\int_0^t - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\, dt'$$\n$$\\left[ \\ln(z') \\right]_{H_g}^{z(t)} = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\left[ t' \\right]_0^t$$\n$$\\ln(z(t)) - \\ln(H_g) = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{z(t)}{H_g}\\right) = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t$$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the vertical position as a function of time:\n$$z(t) = H_g \\exp(- \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t)$$\n\nThe problem defines the e-folding settling time, $t_{\\mathrm{set}}$, as the time at which the height is reduced by a factor of $e$, i.e., $z(t_{\\mathrm{set}}) = H_g / e = H_g \\exp(-1)$. We substitute this into our solution:\n$$H_g \\exp(-1) = H_g \\exp(- \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t_{\\mathrm{set}})$$\n\nCancelling $H_g$ and equating the exponents, we find:\n$$-1 = - \\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}} t_{\\mathrm{set}}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{set}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega^2 t_{\\mathrm{stop}}}$$\n\nFinally, we must express this result in terms of the fundamental parameters provided: $\\Omega$, $\\rho_{g0}$, $c_s$, $\\rho_s$, and $s$. We substitute the given expression for the stopping time, $t_{\\mathrm{stop}} = \\frac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g0} c_s}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{set}} = \\frac{1}{\\Omega^2 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_s s}{\\rho_{g0} c_s} \\right)}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{set}} = \\frac{\\rho_{g0} c_s}{\\Omega^2 \\rho_s s}$$\n\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the e-folding settling time.",

It is a valid problem. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the mass growth rate, $\\frac{dM}{dt}=\\dot{M}$, in terms of the specified variables. We begin with the given formula for the accretion rate:\n$$ \\dot{M}=2 R_{\\mathrm{acc}}\\,\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{peb}}\\,v_{\\mathrm{rel}} $$\nThe problem states that the capture radius is the Hill radius, $R_{\\mathrm{acc}}=R_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and the relative velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\approx \\frac{3}{2}\\Omega R_{\\mathrm{acc}}$.

Derivation of Regime Boundaries**\n\n**Regime 1: Suppression of Pebble Capture**\n\nPebble accretion relies on aerodynamic drag to dissipate a pebble's kinetic energy, allowing for gravitational capture. This process is efficient only if the pebble can be slowed down significantly during its passage through the embryo's gravitational sphere of influence, which is of order the Hill radius $r_H$.\n\nA robust order-of-magnitude criterion for capture is that the aerodynamic stopping time, $t_{\\mathrm{stop}}$, must be less than or comparable to the time it takes for the pebble to cross the Hill sphere, $t_{\\mathrm{cross}}$.\nThe crossing time is $t_{\\mathrm{cross}} \\approx \\frac{2r_H}{\\Delta v}$.\n\nThe boundary case where pebble capture becomes inefficient is therefore $t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\approx t_{\\mathrm{cross}}$.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{stop}} \\approx \\frac{2r_H}{\\Delta v} $$\nSubstituting $\\Delta v = v_K \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{stop}} = \\mathrm{St}/\\Omega = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot (a/v_K)$, we can solve for the limiting value of $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{St} \\cdot a}{v_K} \\approx \\frac{2r_H}{v_K \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2}} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx \\frac{2r_H}{\\mathrm{St} \\cdot a} = \\frac{2}{\\mathrm{St}} \\left(\\frac{r_H}{a}\\right) $$\nUsing our calculated values for $r_H/a$ and the given $\\mathrm{St}$:\n$$ \\frac{r_H}{a} = \\frac{5.51 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}}{1.496 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.00368 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx \\frac{2}{0.1} (0.00368) = 20 \\times 0.00368 = 0.0736 $$\nThus, pebble capture is expected to be suppressed for $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.074$.\n\n**Regime 2: Onset of Collisional Fragmentation**\n\nWhen pebble capture is suppressed, the embryo can still grow by colliding with planetesimals (if present). This is dominated by gravity. However, if the collision energy is too high, the impact will lead to net mass loss (fragmentation or erosion) rather than accretion.\nA standard criterion for the transition from accretional to destructive collisions is when the kinetic energy of the encounter at infinity, $\\frac{1}{2}m(\\Delta v)^2$, becomes comparable to the gravitational binding energy of the target. For a small body hitting a larger one, this simplifies to the condition that the approach velocity $\\Delta v$ is comparable to the escape velocity of the larger body, $v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$.\nWhen $\\Delta v \\gtrsim v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$, collisions become increasingly destructive.\n\nThe boundary is therefore at $\\Delta v \\approx v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$:\n$$ v_K \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx v_{\\mathrm{esc}} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{esc}}}{v_K} $$\nUsing our calculated values:\n$$ \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx \\frac{3.72 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{2.98 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.125 $$\nThus, collisional fragmentation is expected to become the dominant process for $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.125$.\n\n**Summary of Regimes**\nBased on these derivations, we define three distinct regimes based on the embryo's random velocity, parameterized by $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2}$:\n1.  **Pebble Accretion**: $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\lesssim 0.074$.\n2.  **Planetesimal Accretion**: $0.074 \\lesssim \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\lesssim 0.125$.\n3.  **Collisional Fragmentation**: $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.125$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Pebble capture is suppressed once $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.074$; planetesimal accretion dominates for $0.074 \\lesssim \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\lesssim 0.125$; for $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.125$, collisions are too energetic for accretion and collisional fragmentation/destruction dominates.**\n    This statement perfectly matches our derived thresholds. The value for pebble capture suppression, $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.074$, is consistent with our calculation. The transition to the fragmentation regime at $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.125$ is also consistent with our calculation. The overall physical picture presented is correct.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Pebble capture is suppressed when $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim r_H/a \\approx 0.0037$; planetesimal accretion dominates for $0.0037 \\lesssim \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\lesssim 0.01$; beyond $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.01$, collisional fragmentation dominates.**\n    The threshold for pebble capture suppression is incorrect. It neglects the crucial factor of $2/\\mathrm{St} = 2/0.1 = 20$. The threshold for fragmentation is also incorrect; $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx 0.01$ implies $\\Delta v \\approx 298\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, which is much less than $v_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\approx 3720\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. Collisions at this speed would be accretional.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Pebble capture remains efficient up to $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\approx 0.3$; planetesimal accretion dominates for $0.3 \\lesssim \\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\lesssim 0.5$; only for $\\sqrt{e^2 + i^2} \\gtrsim 0.5$ does collisional fragmentation dominate.**\n    Both thresholds given in this option are significantly larger than the values derived from the physical parameters. An eccentricity/inclination of $0.3$ is far too high for efficient pebble capture, and fragmentation would dominate long before $\\sqrt{e^2+i^2}$ reaches $0.5$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. For $\\mathrm{St} = 0.1$, gas drag ensures pebbles are always captured regardless of $e$ and $i$; collisional fragmentation never dominates in this setting.**\n    This statement is physically false. At sufficiently high encounter velocities (large $e$ and $i$), the kinetic energy of the pebbles will overwhelm the ability of gas drag to slow them down for capture. Likewise, high-velocity collisions inevitably lead to fragmentation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
