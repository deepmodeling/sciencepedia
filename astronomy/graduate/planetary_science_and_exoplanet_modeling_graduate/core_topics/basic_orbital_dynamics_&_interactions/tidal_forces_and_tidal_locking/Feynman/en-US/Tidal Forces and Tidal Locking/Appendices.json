This exercise challenges you to use scaling relations, a powerful tool in astrophysics, to determine how the tidal force on a planet in the habitable zone depends on the mass of its host star . By combining the tidal force equation with the stellar mass-luminosity relation and the definition of a habitable zone, you will develop a key intuition for how stellar properties dictate the tidal environment of their planets.",

            "problem": "The tidal force, $F_T$, exerted by a star of mass $M_s$ on an orbiting planet of mass $m_p$ and radius $R_p$ at a distance $D$ can be approximated by the expression $F_T \\approx \\frac{2 G M_s m_p R_p}{D^3}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. This force is responsible for phenomena like oceanic tides and tidal locking.\n\nWe wish to compare the tidal forces experienced by identical Earth-like planets (i.e., where $m_p$ and $R_p$ are considered constant) that are orbiting different main-sequence stars. A key factor in this comparison is the planet's location within the star's habitable zone. The habitable zone is defined as the region around a star where a planet can maintain liquid water on its surface. For this problem, assume a planet is located at the center of its star's habitable zone if it receives the same energy flux (power per unit area) as Earth receives from the Sun.\n\nFor main-sequence stars, their luminosity $L_s$ (total power output) is related to their mass $M_s$ by the approximate power law $L_s \\propto M_s^\\alpha$, with the exponent $\\alpha = 3.5$.\n\nAssuming the tidal force $F_T$ on such a planet in the habitable zone scales with the star's mass $M_s$ according to the relation $F_T \\propto M_s^\\gamma$, determine the numerical value of the exponent $\\gamma$.

            "solution": "The goal is to find the exponent $\\gamma$ in the scaling relation $F_T \\propto M_s^\\gamma$.\n\nWe are given the expression for the tidal force:\n$$F_T \\approx \\frac{2 G M_s m_p R_p}{D^3}$$\nThe problem states that we are considering identical Earth-like planets, which means the planet's mass $m_p$ and radius $R_p$ are constant. The gravitational constant $G$ and the factor of 2 are also constants. Therefore, we can write the proportionality for the tidal force as:\n$$F_T \\propto \\frac{M_s}{D^3}$$\nThis shows how the tidal force depends on the star's mass $M_s$ and the orbital distance $D$.\n\nNext, we need to determine how the orbital distance $D$ depends on the star's mass $M_s$. The problem specifies that the planet is located in the center of the habitable zone, which is defined by the condition that the planet receives a constant energy flux, $f_0$. The energy flux received by a planet from its star of luminosity $L_s$ at a distance $D$ is given by the inverse-square law:\n$$f = \\frac{L_s}{4\\pi D^2}$$\nAccording to the habitable zone definition provided, this flux is a constant, $f = f_0$.\n$$\\frac{L_s}{4\\pi D^2} = f_0$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the distance $D$:\n$$D^2 = \\frac{L_s}{4\\pi f_0}$$\nSince $4\\pi$ and $f_0$ are constants, we can establish a scaling relation between the distance $D$ and the star's luminosity $L_s$:\n$$D^2 \\propto L_s \\implies D \\propto L_s^{1/2}$$\n\nThe problem provides the mass-luminosity relation for main-sequence stars:\n$$L_s \\propto M_s^\\alpha$$\nWe can substitute this into our scaling relation for $D$:\n$$D \\propto (M_s^\\alpha)^{1/2} = M_s^{\\alpha/2}$$\nThis equation tells us how the habitable zone distance scales with the mass of the star.\n\nNow we can substitute this scaling for $D$ back into our scaling relation for the tidal force $F_T$:\n$$F_T \\propto \\frac{M_s}{D^3} \\propto \\frac{M_s}{(M_s^{\\alpha/2})^3}$$\nUsing the rules of exponents, we can simplify this expression:\n$$F_T \\propto \\frac{M_s}{M_s^{3\\alpha/2}} = M_s^{1 - 3\\alpha/2}$$\nBy comparing this result with the given form $F_T \\propto M_s^\\gamma$, we can identify the exponent $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = 1 - \\frac{3\\alpha}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical value for $\\alpha = 3.5$ to calculate $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = 1 - \\frac{3 \\times 3.5}{2} = 1 - \\frac{10.5}{2} = 1 - 5.25$$\n$$\\gamma = -4.25$$\nThe result $-4.25$ already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed. This negative exponent implies that planets in the habitable zones of more massive stars experience significantly weaker tidal forces.",

Begin from Newtonian gravitation and the definition of a tidal bulge characterized by a potential perturbation that scales with the host star mass and falls off with separation. Model the response of the planet with a linear rheology characterized by a quadrupolar tidal Love number and a constant time lag. Assume the following physical regime: a circular orbit, zero obliquity, tides raised on the planet by the star dominate, and the orbit-averaged torque can be represented by a leading-order term proportional to the desynchronization between the planetary spin and the orbital mean motion. Do not assume any specific shortcut or pre-derived formula; derive the governing ordinary differential equation for the spin evolution from conservation of angular momentum, the scaling of the tidal torque, and the definition of the planet’s moment of inertia.\n\nYour derivation must explicitly use the following foundational bases:\n\n- Newton’s law of universal gravitation: the gravitational acceleration of a mass $m$ due to a mass $M$ at separation $r$ is $G M / r^{2}$.\n- The definition of the orbital mean motion for a circular orbit: $n = \\sqrt{G M_{\\star} / a^{3}}$.\n- The definition of the planet’s axial moment of inertia: $C = \\alpha m_{p} R_{p}^{2}$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$ is a dimensionless factor.\n- The qualitative fact that, in the constant time-lag description, the net tidal torque on the planet is opposite in sign to the desynchronization and scales with the host-star mass, the planet’s radius, and declines steeply with orbital separation.\n\nWith these, you must:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The user's request is to derive the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing planetary spin evolution under tidal torques within the constant time-lag model, solve it to find the tidal locking timescale, and use this solution to investigate the scaling of this timescale with orbital distance.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Governing ODE for Spin Evolution\n\nThe evolution of a planet's spin angular momentum, $L$, is dictated by the net external torque, $\\Gamma$, acting upon it. The fundamental equation of motion for rotation is $\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\Gamma$. The spin angular momentum of the planet, assuming it is a rigid body rotating about a principal axis, is $L = C\\Omega$, where $C$ is the moment of inertia about the spin axis and $\\Omega$ is the spin angular rate. The problem states that $C = \\alpha m_p R_p^2$, where $m_p$ is the planet's mass, $R_p$ is its radius, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless factor related to the internal mass distribution. Assuming $C$ is constant, the equation of motion becomes:\n$$\nC \\frac{d\\Omega}{dt} = \\Gamma\n$$\nOur primary task is to derive the expression for the tidal torque, $\\Gamma$.\n\n1.  **Tidal Potential:** A star of mass $M_{\\star}$ at a distance $a$ from a planet raises a tide. The gravitational potential from the star at a point $\\vec{r}$ relative to the planet's center can be expanded. The term responsible for the dominant, quadrupolar tide is:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{\\mathrm{tide}}(\\vec{r}) \\approx -\\frac{G M_{\\star} r^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)\n    $$\n    where $r=|\\vec{r}|$, $\\theta$ is the angle from the star-planet axis, and $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)$ is the second-order Legendre polynomial. This potential field attempts to deform the planet into a prolate spheroid aligned with the star.\n\n2.  **Planetary Response and the Tidal Bulge:** The planet is not perfectly rigid and deforms under the influence of $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{tide}}$. This deformation is characterized by the dimensionless quadrupolar tidal Love number, $k_2$. The resulting mass redistribution within the planet creates a perturbation to the planet's own gravitational potential. The external potential perturbation from this tidal bulge is given by:\n    $$\n    \\Delta\\Phi_p(\\vec{r}) = -k_2 \\left(\\frac{R_p}{r}\\right)^5 \\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta')\n    $$\n    where $\\theta'$ is the angle relative to the axis of the bulge.\n\n3.  **Constant Time-Lag and Bulge Misalignment:** Due to internal friction, the planet's response to the tidal forcing is not instantaneous. In the constant time-lag model, this delay is parametrized by $\\Delta t$. The planet rotates at a rate $\\Omega$ while orbiting at a mean motion $n$. The tidal bulge is therefore carried along with the planet's rotation, leading to a misalignment between the bulge's major axis and the line connecting the star and planet. The angle of this misalignment, $\\delta$, is proportional to the desynchronization, $(\\Omega - n)$, and the time lag, $\\Delta t$. For a small lag, the angle is:\n    $$\n    \\delta \\approx (\\Omega - n)\\Delta t\n    $$\n    If $\\Omega > n$ (supersynchronous rotation), the bulge is carried ahead of the star-planet line ($\\delta > 0$). If $\\Omega < n$ (subsynchronous rotation), the bulge lags behind ($\\delta < 0$).\n\n4.  **Tidal Torque Calculation:** The misaligned bulge is now subject to a differential gravitational pull from the star, which results in a net torque. The torque exerted by the star on the planet's tidally deformed mass distribution can be formally calculated. The standard result for the axial component of this torque, to leading order, is:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma = - \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{G M_{\\star}^2 R_p^5}{a^6} k_2 \\sin(2\\delta)\n    $$\n    The negative sign indicates that the torque acts to reduce the misalignment. If the bulge leads ($\\delta > 0$), the torque is negative, slowing the planet's rotation. If the bulge lags ($\\delta < 0$), the torque is positive, speeding it up. In both cases, the torque drives the spin rate $\\Omega$ towards the mean motion $n$.\n\n5.  **The Final ODE:** For small tidal lags and desynchronization, the angle $\\delta$ is small, allowing the approximation $\\sin(2\\delta) \\approx 2\\delta = 2(\\Omega - n)\\Delta t$. Substituting this into the torque expression yields:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma \\approx -3 \\frac{G M_{\\star}^2 R_p^5}{a^6} k_2 \\Delta t (\\Omega - n)\n    $$\n    We now insert this torque into the equation of motion, $C\\frac{d\\Omega}{dt} = \\Gamma$, with $C = \\alpha m_p R_p^2$:\n    $$\n    (\\alpha m_p R_p^2) \\frac{d\\Omega}{dt} = -3 \\frac{G M_{\\star}^2 R_p^5}{a^6} k_2 \\Delta t (\\Omega - n)\n    $$\n    Dividing by $C$ gives the final ODE for the spin rate $\\Omega(t)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\Omega}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{3 k_2 G M_{\\star}^2 R_p^3}{\\alpha m_p a^6} \\Delta t \\right) (\\Omega - n)\n    $$\n    This equation is of the form $\\frac{d\\Omega}{dt} = -K(\\Omega - n)$, where $K$ is a positive constant representing the inverse timescale of the tidal decay.\n\n### Part 2: Solution and Tidal Locking Timescale\n\nThe derived ODE is a first-order linear differential equation. Letting the desynchronization be $y(t) = \\Omega(t) - n$, the equation is $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -Ky$, with $y(0) = \\Omega_0 - n$. The solution is $y(t) = y(0)e^{-Kt}$. Substituting back for $\\Omega(t)$:\n$$\n\\Omega(t) = n + (\\Omega_0 - n) e^{-Kt}\n$$\nThis solution shows that the spin rate $\\Omega(t)$ exponentially approaches the synchronous state $\\Omega=n$ with a characteristic e-folding time of $1/K$.\n\nThe tidal locking time, $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$, is defined as the time required for the desynchronization to fall to a small fraction $\\varepsilon$ of the mean motion, i.e., $|\\Omega(t) - n| \\le \\varepsilon n$. Using our solution:\n$$\n|\\Omega(t_{\\mathrm{lock}}) - n| = |(\\Omega_0 - n) e^{-Kt_{\\mathrm{lock}}}| = |\\Omega_0 - n| e^{-Kt_{\\mathrm{lock}}} = \\varepsilon n\n$$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$:\n$$\ne^{-Kt_{\\mathrm{lock}}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon n}{|\\Omega_0 - n|} \\implies -Kt_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon n}{|\\Omega_0 - n|}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\frac{1}{K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\Omega_0 - n|}{\\varepsilon n}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K$ gives the full equation for the locking time:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{lock}} = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha m_p a^6}{3 k_2 G M_{\\star}^2 R_p^3 \\Delta t} \\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\Omega_0 - n|}{\\varepsilon n}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Scaling Law with Semi-Major Axis\n\nThe expression for $t_{\\mathrm{lock}}$ reveals its dependence on the semi-major axis $a$. The dominant term is the pre-factor, which scales as $a^6$. The orbital mean motion also depends on $a$ as $n = \\sqrt{GM_{\\star}/a^3} \\propto a^{-3/2}$. The logarithmic term thus has a weaker, secondary dependence on $a$.\nTo first order, the scaling law is $t_{\\mathrm{lock}} \\propto a^6$.\nThis extremely strong dependence means that tidal locking is highly sensitive to orbital distance.\nThe empirical scaling exponent $s$ can be computed from two simulations at different semi-major axes, $a_A$ and $a_B$, with corresponding locking times $t_{\\mathrm{lock},A}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{lock},B}$:\n$$\ns_{AB} = \\frac{\\ln(t_{\\mathrm{lock},B} / t_{\\mathrm{lock},A})}{\\ln(a_B / a_A)}\n$$\nIf the scaling were a perfect power law $t_{\\mathrm{lock}} \\propto a^s$, then $s_{AB}$ would be exactly $s$. Due to the logarithmic term's dependence on $a$, the empirical exponent $s_{AB}$ will deviate slightly from $6$. As $a$ increases, $n$ decreases. For a fast initial rotator ($\\Omega_0 \\gg n$), the argument of the logarithm, $\\frac{|\\Omega_0-n|}{n} \\approx \\frac{\\Omega_0}{n}$, increases. This makes the logarithmic factor larger for larger $a$, causing the empirical exponent $s_{AB}$ to be slightly greater than $6$.",

At distances $r$ much larger than the anti-de Sitter (AdS) curvature scale $\\ell$ but smaller than the crossover scale to higher-dimensional gravity, the effective 4D gravitational potential is given by:\n$$\n\\Phi(r) = - \\frac{GM}{r} - \\frac{2GM\\ell^2}{3r^3}\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $\\ell$ is the AdS curvature length scale, a fundamental parameter of the model.\n\nA small, spherical satellite of uniform density $\\rho_{sat}$ orbits this central mass $M$. The satellite is held together solely by its own self-gravity. The Roche limit is the orbital distance at which such a satellite is disrupted by the tidal forces of the central body. For the purpose of this problem, we define the Roche limit as the distance $d$ where the tidal force exerted by the central mass on a test particle at the satellite's surface (on the line connecting the centers of the two bodies) exactly balances the satellite's own gravitational pull on that particle.\n\nLet $d_R$ be the classical Roche limit calculated using the standard Newtonian potential ($\\ell=0$). The modified potential introduces a correction, leading to a new Roche limit $d_R'$. Assuming the correction is small, we can write $d_R' = d_R(1+\\delta)$, where $\\delta \\ll 1$ is the leading-order fractional correction.\n\nDerive an expression for this fractional correction $\\delta$ in terms of the central mass $M$, the satellite's density $\\rho_{sat}$, the AdS length scale $\\ell$, and the gravitational constant $G$.",
            "solution": "We balance the tidal acceleration from the modified potential against the satellite’s self‐gravity.\n\n1.  Write the effective potential and its derivatives:\n$$\n\\Phi(r)=-\\frac{GM}{r}-\\frac{2GM\\ell^2}{3r^3}, \n\\quad\n\\Phi'(r)=\\frac{GM}{r^2}+\\frac{2GM\\ell^2}{r^4},\n\\quad\n\\Phi''(r)=-\\frac{2GM}{r^3}-\\frac{8GM\\ell^2}{r^5}.\n$$\n\n2.
