All mathematical and physical constructs (Pauli operators, Fock spaces, bosonic operators, tensor products) are standard and rigorously defined. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks to identify the system and bath Hilbert spaces based on the given composite space structure and the action of the Hamiltonian components. The provided information is complete and consistent, leading to a unique decomposition. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, formal, and objective, using standard terminology from quantum theory. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the identification and characterization of the system Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{S}$ and the bath Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{B}$. The analysis begins from the foundational principle that the Hilbert space of a composite system is the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of its constituent subsystems.\n\nThe total Hilbert space of the composite system is given as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\otimes\\left(\\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression presents $\\mathcal{H}$ as a tensor product of two distinct Hilbert spaces: the space $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ and the space $\\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$. According to the principle of system decomposition, these two factors correspond to the system and the bath.\n\nTo confirm which factor is the system and which is the bath, we analyze the structure of the given Hamiltonian, $H = H_{S} + H_{B} + H_{I}$. The operators in each term act on specific parts of the total Hilbert space.\nIn quantum mechanics, an operator of the form $A \\otimes B$ acting on a space $\\mathcal{H}_1 \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_2$ means that operator $A$ acts on $\\mathcal{H}_1$ and operator $B$ acts on $\\mathcal{H}_2$. An operator $A$ on $\\mathcal{H}_1$ is formally written as $A \\otimes I_2$ on the composite space, where $I_2$ is the identity on $\\mathcal{H}_2$.\n\n1.  The term $H_{S} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\,\\sigma_{z} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\,\\sigma_{x}$ involves the Pauli operators $\\sigma_{z}$ and $\\sigma_{x}$. These are $2 \\times 2$ matrices that act on a two-dimensional complex vector space, which is precisely $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$. Thus, $H_{S}$ acts non-trivially only on the $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ factor of $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n2.  The term $H_{B} = \\sum_{k\\in K}\\hbar\\omega_{k}\\,b_{k}^{\\dagger}b_{k}$ involves the bosonic creation and annihilation operators $b_{k}^{\\dagger}$ and $b_{k}$. By definition, for each $k \\in K$, these operators act on the corresponding Fock space $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$. The sum over all $k$ means this operator acts on the entire tensor product space $\\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$. Thus, $H_{B}$ acts non-trivially only on the $\\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ factor of $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n3.  The interaction term $H_{I} = \\sigma_{z}\\sum_{k\\in K}\\bigl(g_{k}\\,b_{k} + g_{k}^{*}\\,b_{k}^{\\dagger}\\bigr)$ explicitly demonstrates the coupling. It is a product of an operator $\\sigma_z$ acting on the $\\mathbb{C}^2$ space and an operator $\\sum_{k\\in K}\\bigl(g_{k}\\,b_{k} + g_{k}^{*}\\,b_{k}^{\\dagger}\\bigr)$ acting on the $\\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ space.\n\nThis analysis unambiguously confirms the decomposition. The \"system\" is the two-level entity described by $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$, and the \"bath\" is the collection of bosonic modes described by $\\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we identify:\nThe **System Hilbert Space** is $\\mathcal{H}_{S} = \\mathbb{C}^{2}$.\nThe **Bath Hilbert Space** is $\\mathcal{H}_{B} = \\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$.\n\nNext, we characterize each space:\n\n**System Hilbert Space $\\mathcal{H}_{S}$:**\n-   **Structure**: $\\mathcal{H}_{S} = \\mathbb{C}^{2}$ is the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space that describes a two-level quantum system (a qubit or a spin-1/2 particle).\n-   **Dimension**: The dimension is, by definition, $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{S}) = 2$.\n\n**Bath Hilbert Space $\\mathcal{H}_{B}$:**\n-   **Structure**: $\\mathcal{H}_{B} = \\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ is a tensor product of the individual Fock spaces $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ for each mode $k$ in the countable set $K$. Each $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ is the Hilbert space for a single quantum harmonic oscillator.\n-   **Basis Characterization**: For each mode $k$, the Fock space $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ possesses a countable orthonormal basis of number states, $\\{|n_{k}\\rangle\\}_{n_{k}=0}^{\\infty}$, where $n_{k}$ is the occupation number of the mode. A basis for the total bath space $\\mathcal{H}_{B}$ is formed by taking the tensor product of basis states from each individual mode space. A general basis vector can be written as:\n    $$\n    |\\{n_{k}\\}_{k\\in K}\\rangle = \\bigotimes_{k\\in K} |n_{k}\\rangle_k\n    $$\n    where $\\{n_{k}\\}_{k\\in K}$ is a sequence of non-negative integers specifying the occupation number for every mode in the bath. This constitutes the multi-mode Fock basis.\n-   **Separability**: Each individual Fock space $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ is a separable Hilbert space, as it has a countable orthonormal basis. Since the index set $K$ is countable, the tensor product $\\mathcal{H}_{B} = \\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ is also a separable Hilbert space.\n-   **Dimension**: For each mode $k$, the space $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$ is infinite-dimensional, as the occupation number $n_{k}$ can be any non-negative integer ($n_{k} \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$). The tensor product of an infinite number of non-trivial spaces (or even one infinite-dimensional space with any non-trivial space) is infinite-dimensional. Thus, the dimension of the bath Hilbert space is $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{B}) = \\infty$.\n\nIn summary, the problem's inputs lead to the following characterizations:\n-   $\\mathcal{H}_{S} = \\mathbb{C}^{2}$\n-   $\\mathcal{H}_{B} = \\bigotimes_{k\\in K}\\mathcal{F}_{k}$\n-   $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{S}) = 2$\n-   $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{B}) = \\infty$\n\nThese results are collected into the required matrix format for the final answer.",

Summing the components in Gauge $\\mathcal{G}_1$:\n$$ H = H_{S}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} + H_{B} + H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} = \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} \\sigma_z + \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\hbar \\lambda \\,\\sigma_z \\,(a + a^{\\dagger}) $$\nSumming the components in Gauge $\\mathcal{G}_2$:\n$$ H = H_{S}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} + H_{B} + H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} \\sigma_z + \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left( \\hbar \\lambda \\,\\sigma_z \\,(a + a^{\\dagger}) + \\frac{\\hbar \\delta}{2} \\sigma_z \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} \\sigma_z + \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\hbar \\lambda \\,\\sigma_z \\,(a + a^{\\dagger}) $$\nThe total Hamiltonian $H$ is indeed the same in both partitions.\n\nTo find the ground state and its energy, we must diagonalize $H$. The operator $\\sigma_z$ commutes with the entire Hamiltonian:\n$$ [\\sigma_z, H] = \\left[\\sigma_z, \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} \\sigma_z\\right] + \\left[\\sigma_z, \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right] + \\left[\\sigma_z, \\hbar \\lambda \\,\\sigma_z \\,(a + a^{\\dagger})\\right] = 0 + 0 + \\hbar\\lambda (a+a^\\dagger) [\\sigma_z, \\sigma_z] = 0 $$\nSince $[H, \\sigma_z] = 0$, the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in the eigenbasis of $\\sigma_z$. Let $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $\\sigma_z$ with eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$, respectively. We can consider the action of $H$ on the two subspaces spanned by $|\\uparrow\\rangle \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$ and $|\\downarrow\\rangle \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$, where $\\mathcal{H}_B$ is the Fock space of the boson.\n\nFor the spin-up subspace ($\\sigma_z \\to +1$), the effective Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} + \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\hbar \\lambda (a + a^{\\dagger}) $$\nThis describes a displaced harmonic oscillator. To find its energy spectrum, we complete the square by defining a new bosonic operator $b = a + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$. Since $\\lambda$ and $\\omega$ are real, $b^{\\dagger} = a^{\\dagger} + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$. These new operators satisfy the canonical commutation relation $[b, b^{\\dagger}] = [a, a^{\\dagger}] = 1$. We can express $a$ and $a^{\\dagger}$ as $a = b - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$ and $a^{\\dagger} = b^{\\dagger} - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$. Substituting these into the oscillator part of $H_{\\uparrow}$:\n$$ \\hbar \\omega a^{\\dagger} a + \\hbar \\lambda (a + a^{\\dagger}) = \\hbar \\omega \\left(b^{\\dagger} - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}\\right)\\left(b - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}\\right) + \\hbar \\lambda \\left(b - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega} + b^{\\dagger} - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\hbar \\omega \\left(b^{\\dagger} b - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega} (b + b^{\\dagger}) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\omega^2}\\right) + \\hbar \\lambda (b + b^{\\dagger}) - \\frac{2\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} = \\hbar \\omega b^{\\dagger} b - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\nInserting this back into $H_{\\uparrow}$:\n$$ H_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} + \\hbar \\omega b^{\\dagger} b - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} = \\hbar \\omega \\left(b^{\\dagger} b + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\nThe ground state of this Hamiltonian corresponds to the vacuum of the $b$ operators, with energy eigenvalue:\n$$ E_{\\uparrow, GS} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\n\nFor the spin-down subspace ($\\sigma_z \\to -1$), the effective Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H_{\\downarrow} = -\\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} + \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\hbar \\lambda (a + a^{\\dagger}) $$\nThis is a displaced harmonic oscillator with coupling $g=-\\lambda$. The same procedure applies. We define a new operator $c = a - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$ (with $c^\\dagger = a^\\dagger - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$ and $[c, c^\\dagger]=1$). The Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$ H_{\\downarrow} = \\hbar \\omega \\left(c^{\\dagger} c + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\nThe ground state energy of this block is:\n$$ E_{\\downarrow, GS} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\n\nThe true ground state energy of the total system, $E_{GS}$, is the minimum of these two energies:\n$$ E_{GS} = \\min(E_{\\uparrow, GS}, E_{\\downarrow, GS}) = \\min \\left( \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2}, -\\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} \\right) + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\n$$ E_{GS} = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\omega_0 + \\delta| + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\nThe problem states that $\\omega_0 + \\delta  0$, so $|\\omega_0 + \\delta| = \\omega_0 + \\delta$. Therefore, the minimum energy is $E_{\\downarrow, GS}$.\n$$ E_{GS} = \\langle H \\rangle_{GS} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} - \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} $$\nThis is the total ground-state energy of the system. As it is an eigenvalue of the total Hamiltonian $H$, its value must be independent of the chosen gauge (partitioning).\n\nNext, we explicitly demonstrate this gauge invariance. The ground state of the system is the state corresponding to the energy $E_{\\downarrow, GS}$:\n$$ |GS\\rangle = |\\downarrow\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi_{\\downarrow, GS}\\rangle $$\nwhere $|\\phi_{\\downarrow, GS}\\rangle$ is the ground state of the oscillator part of $H_{\\downarrow}$. This state is the vacuum for the operator $c = a - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$, i.e., $c |\\phi_{\\downarrow, GS}\\rangle = 0$. This implies $(a - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega})|\\phi_{\\downarrow, GS}\\rangle = 0$. This defines $|\\phi_{\\downarrow, GS}\\rangle$ as a coherent state $|\\alpha\\rangle$ with displacement $\\alpha = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}$. So, $|GS\\rangle = |\\downarrow\\rangle \\otimes |\\alpha = \\lambda/\\omega\\rangle$.\n\nNow we compute the ground-state expectation values of relevant operators.\n$$ \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle_{GS} = \\langle \\downarrow | \\sigma_z | \\downarrow \\rangle \\langle \\alpha | \\alpha \\rangle = (-1)(1) = -1 $$\n$$ \\langle a + a^{\\dagger} \\rangle_{GS} = \\langle \\downarrow | \\downarrow \\rangle \\langle \\alpha | a + a^{\\dagger} | \\alpha \\rangle = (1)(\\alpha + \\alpha^*) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega} + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega} = \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\omega} $$\n$$ \\langle a^{\\dagger}a \\rangle_{GS} = \\langle \\alpha | a^{\\dagger}a | \\alpha \\rangle = |\\alpha|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\omega^2} $$\nThese expectation values are properties of the physical ground state and are thus gauge-invariant.\n\nLet's compute the total energy using the partition of Gauge $\\mathcal{G}_1$:\n$\\langle H \\rangle_{GS}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} = \\langle H_{S}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} \\rangle_{GS} + \\langle H_{B} \\rangle_{GS} + \\langle H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} \\rangle_{GS}$.\n$$ \\langle H_{S}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} \\rangle_{GS} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} \\sigma_z \\right\\rangle_{GS} = \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle_{GS} = -\\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} $$\n$$ \\langle H_{B} \\rangle_{GS} = \\left\\langle \\hbar \\omega \\left(a^{\\dagger} a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right\\rangle_{GS} = \\hbar \\omega \\left(\\langle a^{\\dagger}a \\rangle_{GS} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\hbar \\omega \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\omega^2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} $$\n$$ \\langle H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} \\rangle_{GS} = \\langle \\hbar \\lambda \\,\\sigma_z \\,(a + a^{\\dagger}) \\rangle_{GS} = \\hbar \\lambda \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle_{GS} \\langle a + a^{\\dagger} \\rangle_{GS} = \\hbar \\lambda (-1) \\left(\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\omega}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} $$\nSumming these contributions:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle_{GS}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} = -\\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right) - \\frac{2\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} - \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} $$\nThis matches our directly calculated $E_{GS}$.\n\nNow we compute the total energy using the partition of Gauge $\\mathcal{G}_2$:\n$\\langle H \\rangle_{GS}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} = \\langle H_{S}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} \\rangle_{GS} + \\langle H_{B} \\rangle_{GS} + \\langle H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} \\rangle_{GS}$.\nThe bath part $\\langle H_B \\rangle_{GS}$ is the same.\n$$ \\langle H_{S}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} \\rangle_{GS} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} \\sigma_z \\right\\rangle_{GS} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} \\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle_{GS} = -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} $$\n$$ \\langle H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} \\rangle_{GS} = \\left\\langle \\hbar \\lambda \\,\\sigma_z \\,(a + a^{\\dagger}) + \\frac{\\hbar \\delta}{2} \\sigma_z \\right\\rangle_{GS} = \\langle H_{I}^{(\\mathcal{G}_1)} \\rangle_{GS} + \\left\\langle \\frac{\\hbar \\delta}{2} \\sigma_z \\right\\rangle_{GS} = -\\frac{2\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} - \\frac{\\hbar \\delta}{2} $$\nSumming these contributions:\n$$ \\langle H \\rangle_{GS}^{(\\mathcal{G}_2)} = -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{2\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} - \\frac{\\hbar \\delta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\lambda^2}{\\omega} - \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_0 + \\delta)}{2} $$\nThis also matches $E_{GS}$. We have explicitly shown that while the expectation values of the system Hamiltonian ($\\langle H_S \\rangle$) and the interaction Hamiltonian ($\\langle H_I \\rangle$) are gauge-dependent, their sum, and thus the total energy, is gauge-invariant.\n\nThe final quantity requested is the total ground-state energy, which is a physical observable and must be independent of the gauge choice. Its expression is derived above.",
