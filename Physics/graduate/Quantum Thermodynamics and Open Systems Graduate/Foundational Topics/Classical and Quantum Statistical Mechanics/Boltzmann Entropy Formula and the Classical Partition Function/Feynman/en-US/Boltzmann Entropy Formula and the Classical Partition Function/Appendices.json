The system is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature $T$, described by the canonical ensemble. The inverse temperature is $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**1. The Canonical Partition Function $Z_N(T)$**\n\nThe canonical partition function $Z_N$ for a classical system of $N$ distinguishable degrees of freedom (here, distinguishable oscillators) is given by the integral over the entire $2N$-dimensional phase space, normalized by $h^N$:\n$$Z_N = \\frac{1}{h^N} \\int \\dots \\int \\exp(-\\beta H(\\{q_i, p_i\\})) \\prod_{i=1}^N dq_i dp_i$$\nSince the Hamiltonian is a sum of independent terms, $H = \\sum_{i=1}^N H_i$, the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\beta H)$ becomes a product of individual Boltzmann factors:\n$$Z_N = \\frac{1}{h^N} \\int \\dots \\int \\prod_{i=1}^N \\exp(-\\beta H_i(q_i, p_i)) \\, dq_i dp_i$$\nThe multidimensional integral can be separated into a product of $N$ identical one-particle integrals:\n$$Z_N = \\prod_{i=1}^N \\left[ \\frac{1}{h} \\iint \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left[\\frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q_i^2\\right]\\right) dq_i dp_i \\right]$$\nLet $Z_1$ be the partition function for a single oscillator. Since all oscillators are identical, $Z_N = (Z_1)^N$. We now compute $Z_1$:\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\beta\\frac{p^2}{2m}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\beta\\frac{m\\omega^2q^2}{2}\\right) dp \\, dq$$\nThis integral is a product of two Gaussian integrals:\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{2m}p^2\\right) dp \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta m\\omega^2}{2}q^2\\right) dq \\right)$$\nUsing the standard Gaussian integral formula $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, we evaluate each integral:\nThe momentum integral gives:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{2m}p^2\\right) dp = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\beta/(2m)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}}$$\nThe position integral gives:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta m\\omega^2}{2}q^2\\right) dq = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{(\\beta m\\omega^2)/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m\\omega^2}}$$\nMultiplying these results yields $Z_1$:\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m\\omega^2}} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2 m}{m\\beta^2\\omega^2}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{h\\beta\\omega}$$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}$$\nThe total partition function for $N$ oscillators is therefore:\n$$Z_N(T) = (Z_1)^N = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)^N$$\n\n**2. The Helmholtz Free Energy $F(T)$**\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is related to the canonical partition function by the fundamental relation $F = -k_B T \\ln Z_N$.\n$$F(T) = -k_B T \\ln\\left[\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)^N\\right]$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(x^a) = a\\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$F(T) = -N k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)$$\n\n**3. The Internal Energy $U(T)$**\n\nThe average internal energy $U$ can be calculated from the partition function as $U = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta} \\ln Z_N$.\nFirst, we express $\\ln Z_N$ in terms of $\\beta$:\n$$\\ln Z_N = \\ln\\left[\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{h\\omega\\beta}\\right)^N\\right] = N \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{h\\omega\\beta}\\right) = N(\\ln(2\\pi) - \\ln(h\\omega) - \\ln\\beta)$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta} \\ln Z_N = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta} [N(\\text{const} - \\ln\\beta)] = -N \\frac{1}{\\beta}$$\nThus, the internal energy is:\n$$U = - \\left(-\\frac{N}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{N}{\\beta}$$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$U(T) = N k_B T$$\nThis result is consistent with the classical equipartition theorem, where each of the $2N$ quadratic degrees of freedom ($p_i^2$ and $q_i^2$) contributes $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$ to the total energy.\n\n**4. The Entropy $S(T)$**\n\nThe entropy $S$ can be derived from the thermodynamic relation $F = U - TS$, which gives $S = (U-F)/T$.\nUsing our expressions for $U(T)$ and $F(T)$:\n$$S(T) = \\frac{1}{T} \\left[ N k_B T - \\left(-N k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)\\right) \\right]$$\n$$S(T) = \\frac{1}{T} \\left[ N k_B T + N k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right) \\right]$$\nSimplifying by factoring out $N k_B T$:\n$$S(T) = N k_B \\left[1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)\\right]$$\nAlternatively, we could use $S = -(\\partial F/\\partial T)_{N, \\omega}$, which yields the same result.\n\n**5. The Heat Capacity $C(T)$**\n\nThe heat capacity at constant external parameters (here, fixed $\\omega$) is defined as $C = (\\partial U / \\partial T)_{N, \\omega}$.\nUsing our result for the internal energy $U(T) = N k_B T$:\n$$C(T) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} (N k_B T)$$\nSince $N$ and $k_B$ are constants, the derivative is:\n$$C(T) = N k_B$$\nThis is the classical Dulong-Petit law for this system, indicating that the heat capacity is independent of temperature.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\nThe derived quantities are:\n- $Z_{N}(T) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)^N$\n- $F(T) = -N k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)$\n- $U(T) = N k_B T$\n- $S(T) = N k_B \\left[1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{h\\omega}\\right)\\right]$\n- $C(T) = N k_B$\nThese will be presented in a single row matrix as the final answer.",

We must calculate the volume of this constrained region in the $3N$-dimensional configuration space.\n\nSince the particles are identical, we cannot distinguish which specific particles are in which subvolume. We must consider all possible ways of partitioning the $N$ particles into two groups of $N/2$. The number of ways to choose which $N/2$ particles occupy the left subvolume is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{N/2}$.\nFor any single such choice, the chosen $N/2$ particles are confined to $V_L$, and the remaining $N/2$ particles are confined to $V_R$. The configuration-space volume for this specific partition is:\n$$\n\\left( \\int_{V_L} d^{3(N/2)}q \\right) \\left( \\int_{V_R} d^{3(N/2)}q \\right) = (V/2)^{N/2} (V/2)^{N/2} = (V/2)^N\n$$\nThe total accessible configuration-space volume is the sum over all such partitions.

Change in Entropy**\nThe change in entropy is defined as $\\Delta S = S_{\\mathrm{unconstrained}} - S_{\\mathrm{constrained}}$.

Since $\\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{k} = 2^N$ and $\\binom{N}{N/2}$ is a single (the largest) term in this sum for even $N$, it follows that $2^N > \\binom{N}{N/2}$. Thus, the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$, and $\\Delta s > 0$. This is physically consistent, as adding a constraint to a system reduces its number of accessible microstates and therefore its entropy ($S_{\\mathrm{unconstrained}} > S_{\\mathrm{constrained}}$).\nThe expression is a closed-form analytic result in terms of $N$, as requested.",

A principled method for this is the Poisson summation formula, which for a function $f(x)$ states $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(n) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(k)$, where $\\hat{f}(k)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(x)$.\n\nLet $f(x) = \\exp(-\\alpha x^2)$. The sum we need is related to $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(n) = f(0) + 2 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} f(n) = 1 + 2S$. The Fourier transform is:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\alpha x^2} e^{-2\\pi i k x} dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 k^2}{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\nApplying the Poisson summation formula:\n$$\n1 + 2S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 k^2}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} \\left(1 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 k^2}{\\alpha}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 k^2}{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\nIn the limit $\\alpha \\to 0$, the argument of the exponential in the sum, $-\\pi^2/\\alpha$, becomes very large and negative. The sum is dominated by the $k=1$ term and is of order $\\exp(-\\pi^2/\\alpha)$, which is exponentially small and can be neglected for an asymptotic expansion in powers of $\\sqrt{\\alpha} \\sim \\lambda_T/L$. Therefore, the asymptotic approximation for $S$ is:\n$$\nS \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} = \\sqrt{\\pi \\cdot \\frac{4L^2}{\\pi\\lambda_T^2}} = \\frac{2L}{\\lambda_T}\n$$\nThis gives the 1D sum approximation:\n$$\nS \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2L}{\\lambda_T}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{L}{\\lambda_T} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe 3D quantum partition function is $Z_{\\mathrm{q}} = S^3$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{q}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\n$$\nWe expand this expression and keep terms up to the first correction in the small parameter $\\lambda_T/L$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{q}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\n$$\nThe leading term is $(L/\\lambda_T)^3$, which is exactly $Z_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. The first nontrivial correction term is the next term in the expansion:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{q}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)^3 - \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda_T}\\right)^2 = Z_{\\mathrm{cl}} - \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{L^2}{\\lambda_T^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $Z_{\\mathrm{q}}/Z_{\\mathrm{cl}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{q}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{cl}}} \\approx \\frac{ (L/\\lambda_T)^3 - \\frac{3}{2}(L/\\lambda_T)^2 }{ (L/\\lambda_T)^3 } = 1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{(L/\\lambda_T)^2}{(L/\\lambda_T)^3} = 1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\lambda_T}{L}\n$$\nThe correction term represents the quantum effects due to the finite size of the box and the wave nature of the particle, which are ignored in the purely classical treatment.",
