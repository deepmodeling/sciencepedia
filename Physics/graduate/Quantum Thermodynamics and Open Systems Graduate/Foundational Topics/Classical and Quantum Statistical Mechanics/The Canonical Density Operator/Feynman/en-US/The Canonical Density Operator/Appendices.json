A complete and reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe thermal equilibrium state of a quantum system at a fixed inverse temperature $\\beta$ can be derived from the principle of maximum entropy. This principle posits that the equilibrium density operator $\\rho$ is the one that maximizes the von Neumann entropy, $S(\\rho) = -\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho)$, subject to constraints. For the canonical ensemble, the constraints are that the state is normalized, $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$, and that the average energy is fixed to a value $U$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho H) = U$.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this constrained optimization problem. We seek to maximize the functional:\n$$\nL(\\rho) = -\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho) - \\lambda_{0}(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) - 1) - \\beta(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho H) - U)\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda_0$ and $\\beta$ are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the normalization and energy constraints, respectively. The multiplier for the energy constraint is conventionally denoted by $\\beta$ and is identified with the inverse temperature.\n\nTo find the maximum, we take the functional derivative of $L(\\rho)$ with respect to $\\rho$ and set it to zero. Using the identity $\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho} \\operatorname{Tr}(f(\\rho)) = f'(\\rho)^T$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta \\rho} = -(\\ln \\rho + I) - \\lambda_{0}I - \\beta H = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\ln \\rho$:\n$$\n\\ln \\rho = - (1 + \\lambda_{0})I - \\beta H\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the form of the density operator:\n$$\n\\rho = \\exp(-(1+\\lambda_0)I - \\beta H) = \\exp(-(1+\\lambda_0)) \\exp(-\\beta H)\n$$\nThe multiplier $\\lambda_0$ is determined by the normalization constraint $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) = \\exp(-(1+\\lambda_0)) \\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta H)) = 1\n$$\nThis implies $\\exp(-(1+\\lambda_0)) = \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta H))}$. We define the partition function as $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta H))$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\rho$, we obtain the canonical density operator, also known as the Gibbs state:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H)}{Z}\n$$\nNow, we apply this general result to the specific system. The Hamiltonian is $H = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_z$. The calculations are to be performed in the eigenbasis of $\\sigma_z$, denoted $\\{|{+}\\rangle, |{-}\\rangle\\}$. In this basis, the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_z$ is represented as:\n$$\n\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenstates are $|{+}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|{-}\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = \\frac{\\omega}{2}$ and $E_- = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}$. The Hamiltonian in this basis is diagonal:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\omega}{2}  0 \\\\ 0  -\\frac{\\omega}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the partition function $Z$:\n$$\nZ = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta H)) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{+,-\\}} \\langle i | \\exp(-\\beta H) | i \\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta E_+) + \\exp(-\\beta E_-)\n$$\n$$\nZ = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we construct the matrix for the operator $\\exp(-\\beta H)$:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\beta H) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-\\beta E_+)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-\\beta E_-) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe density matrix $\\rho_\\beta$ is then obtained by dividing by $Z$:\n$$\n\\rho_\\beta = \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this matrix, we identify its four elements in the ordered basis $\\{|{+}\\rangle, |{-}\\rangle \\}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\beta,++} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}{2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}, \\quad \\rho_{\\beta,+-} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{\\beta,-+} = 0, \\quad \\rho_{\\beta,--} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}{2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nFinally, we determine the Bloch vector $\\boldsymbol{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ for the state $\\rho_\\beta$. The components of the Bloch vector are given by $r_i = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho_\\beta \\sigma_i)$. The Pauli matrices are $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -i \\\\ i  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nr_x = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho_\\beta \\sigma_x) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{Z} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{Z} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\dots \\\\ \\dots  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\nr_y = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho_\\beta \\sigma_y) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{Z} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -i \\\\ i  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{Z} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\dots \\\\ \\dots  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\nr_z = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho_\\beta \\sigma_z) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{Z} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nr_z = \\frac{1}{Z} \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{-2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}{2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)} = -\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe Bloch vector is $\\boldsymbol{r} = (0, 0, -\\tanh(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}))$.\n\nWe now assemble the seven requested quantities into a single row matrix:\n$(\\rho_{\\beta,++}, \\rho_{\\beta,+-}, \\rho_{\\beta,-+}, \\rho_{\\beta,--}, r_x, r_y, r_z)$.\nThe final expressions are:\n$\\rho_{\\beta,++} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\omega/2)}{2 \\cosh(\\beta\\omega/2)}$, $\\rho_{\\beta,+-} = 0$, $\\rho_{\\beta,-+} = 0$, $\\rho_{\\beta,--} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta\\omega/2)}{2 \\cosh(\\beta\\omega/2)}$, $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, $r_z = -\\tanh(\\beta\\omega/2)$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard problem in quantum statistical mechanics that can be solved using fundamental principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds in five steps as requested by the problem.\n\n1.  **Energy Eigenvalues and Degeneracies**\n    A spin-$1$ system is characterized by the spin quantum number $s=1$. The operator for the projection of the spin onto the $z$-axis, $S_z$, has eigenvalues $m_s$ where $m_s$ takes values in $\\{-s, -s+1, \\dots, s\\}$. For $s=1$, the eigenvalues of $S_z$ are $m_s \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The corresponding orthonormal eigenstates are denoted by $|m_s\\rangle$, i.e., $|-1\\rangle$, $|0\\rangle$, and $|+1\\rangle$. These states form a basis for the system's Hilbert space.\n\n    The Hamiltonian of the system is given by $H = D S_{z}^{2}$, where $D$ is a positive energy scale. Since the basis states $|m_s\\rangle$ are eigenstates of $S_z$, they are also eigenstates of $H$:\n    $$ H |m_s\\rangle = D S_{z}^{2} |m_s\\rangle = D m_s^2 |m_s\\rangle $$\n    The energy eigenvalues $E_{m_s}$ are therefore $E_{m_s} = D m_s^2$.\n    We can now calculate the energy for each value of $m_s$:\n    - For $m_s = 0$: The energy eigenvalue is $E_0 = D(0)^2 = 0$. This energy level is non-degenerate, as it corresponds to a single state $|0\\rangle$.\n    - For $m_s = +1$: The energy eigenvalue is $E_1 = D(1)^2 = D$.\n    - For $m_s = -1$: The energy eigenvalue is $E_{-1} = D(-1)^2 = D$.\n    The states $|+1\\rangle$ and $|-1\\rangle$ have the same energy $D$. Therefore, this energy level is doubly degenerate.\n\n    In summary, the system has two distinct energy levels:\n    - A ground state with energy $E_g = 0$ and degeneracy $g_g = 1$.\n    - An excited state with energy $E_e = D$ and degeneracy $g_e = 2$.\n\n2.  **Partition Function and Mean Energy**\n    The canonical partition function $Z$ is defined as the trace of the Boltzmann factor, $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H)]$. In the energy eigenbasis, this is a sum over all states:\n    $$ Z = \\sum_{i} g_i \\exp(-\\beta E_i) $$\n    where $g_i$ is the degeneracy of the energy level $E_i$. Using the results from the previous step:\n    $$ Z(\\beta) = g_g \\exp(-\\beta E_g) + g_e \\exp(-\\beta E_e) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta \\cdot 0) + 2 \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta D) $$\n    $$ Z(\\beta) = 1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D) $$\n    The mean energy $\\langle H \\rangle$ of the system is given by the statistical mechanics formula:\n    $$ \\langle H \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln Z(\\beta) $$\n    Substituting the expression for $Z(\\beta)$:\n    $$ \\langle H \\rangle(\\beta) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)) $$\n    $$ \\langle H \\rangle(\\beta) = - \\frac{1}{1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)) $$\n    $$ \\langle H \\rangle(\\beta) = - \\frac{1}{1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)} \\cdot (2 \\exp(-\\beta D) \\cdot (-D)) $$\n    $$ \\langle H \\rangle(\\beta) = \\frac{2 D \\exp(-\\beta D)}{1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)} $$\n\n3.  **Energy Variance**\n    The variance of the energy, $\\operatorname{Var}(H)$, is defined as $\\operatorname{Var}(H) = \\langle H^2 \\rangle - \\langle H \\rangle^2$. In the canonical ensemble, a convenient relation exists:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(H) = -\\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} $$\n    We differentiate the expression for $\\langle H \\rangle(\\beta)$ with respect to $\\beta$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( \\frac{2 D \\exp(-\\beta D)}{1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)} \\right) $$\n    Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $(u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v^2$, with $u = 2 D \\exp(-\\beta D)$ and $v = 1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)$:\n    $$ u' = -2 D^2 \\exp(-\\beta D) $$\n    $$ v' = -2 D \\exp(-\\beta D) $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{(-2 D^2 \\exp(-\\beta D))(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D)) - (2 D \\exp(-\\beta D))(-2 D \\exp(-\\beta D))}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D))^2} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{-2 D^2 \\exp(-\\beta D) - 4 D^2 \\exp(-2\\beta D) + 4 D^2 \\exp(-2\\beta D)}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D))^2} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{-2 D^2 \\exp(-\\beta D)}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D))^2} $$\n    Therefore, the energy variance is:\n    $$ \\operatorname{Var}(H) = \\frac{2 D^2 \\exp(-\\beta D)}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D))^2} $$\n\n4.  **Heat Capacity and Qualitative Behavior**\n    The heat capacity at constant volume, $C$, is defined as $C = \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial T}$. Using the chain rule, we can express this in terms of $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n    $$ C = \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} \\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T} $$\n    Since $\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial T} = -\\frac{1}{k_B T^2} = -k_B \\beta^2$, we have:\n    $$ C(\\beta) = \\left( -\\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\beta} \\right) \\left( k_B \\beta^2 \\right) = k_B \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(H) $$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(H)$:\n    $$ C(\\beta) = k_B \\beta^2 \\left( \\frac{2 D^2 \\exp(-\\beta D)}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D))^2} \\right) = \\frac{2 k_B (\\beta D)^2 \\exp(-\\beta D)}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-\\beta D))^2} $$\n    To analyze the qualitative behavior, we examine the low and high temperature limits. Let $y = \\beta D = D/(k_B T)$.\n    - **Low temperature limit ($T \\to 0$, $\\beta \\to \\infty$, $y \\to \\infty$):**\n      In this limit, $\\exp(-y) \\to 0$. The numerator approaches zero faster than the denominator approaches $1$. Specifically, $C(y) \\approx 2 k_B y^2 \\exp(-y)$, which goes to $0$ as $y \\to \\infty$. This is because the exponential decay dominates the polynomial growth. The system freezes into the ground state.\n    - **High temperature limit ($T \\to \\infty$, $\\beta \\to 0$, $y \\to 0$):**\n      For small $y$, we use the Taylor expansion $\\exp(-y) \\approx 1 - y$.\n      $$ C(y) \\approx \\frac{2 k_B y^2 (1 - y)}{(1 + 2(1 - y))^2} = \\frac{2 k_B y^2 (1 - y)}{(3 - 2y)^2} $$\n      As $y \\to 0$, this becomes $C(y) \\approx \\frac{2 k_B y^2}{3^2} = \\frac{2}{9} k_B (\\beta D)^2$. This approaches $0$ as $\\beta \\to 0$. At high temperatures, all states are approximately equally populated, and adding more heat does not significantly change the populations or the mean energy.\n    Since the heat capacity $C$ is non-negative and approaches zero at both low and high temperatures, it must exhibit a maximum at some intermediate temperature. This peak is known as a Schottky anomaly.\n\n5.  **Maximum of Heat Capacity**\n    To find the inverse temperature $\\beta_{\\star}$ at which the heat capacity is maximum, we must solve $\\frac{dC}{d\\beta} = 0$. It is simpler to work with the dimensionless variable $y = \\beta D$ and take the derivative of the logarithm of $C(y)$ (ignoring the constant prefactor $2k_B$). Let $f(y) = \\frac{y^2 \\exp(-y)}{(1 + 2 \\exp(-y))^2}$. The maximum occurs when $\\frac{d \\ln f(y)}{dy} = 0$.\n    $$ \\ln f(y) = 2\\ln(y) - y - 2\\ln(1 + 2 \\exp(-y)) $$\n    Differentiating with respect to $y$:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dy}\\ln f(y) = \\frac{2}{y} - 1 - 2 \\frac{1}{1+2\\exp(-y)} \\cdot (2\\exp(-y) \\cdot (-1)) = \\frac{2}{y} - 1 + \\frac{4\\exp(-y)}{1+2\\exp(-y)} $$\n    Setting the derivative to zero:\n    $$ \\frac{2}{y} - 1 + \\frac{4\\exp(-y)}{1+2\\exp(-y)} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{2 - y}{y} = - \\frac{4\\exp(-y)}{1+2\\exp(-y)} $$\n    $$ (2 - y)(1 + 2\\exp(-y)) = -4y \\exp(-y) $$\n    $$ 2 + 4\\exp(-y) - y - 2y\\exp(-y) = -4y \\exp(-y) $$\n    $$ 2 - y + 4\\exp(-y) + 2y\\exp(-y) = 0 $$\n    $$ y - 2 = 4\\exp(-y) + 2y\\exp(-y) $$\n    $$ y - 2 = 2 \\exp(-y) (2 + y) $$\n    This is a transcendental equation for the value $y_{\\star}$ where the heat capacity is maximum. We must solve it numerically. Let $g(y) = y - 2 - 2(y+2)\\exp(-y)$. We seek the root of $g(y)=0$.\n    Testing values shows the root lies between $y=2$ and $y=3$. Using a numerical solver (such as Newton's method or fixed-point iteration), we find the solution:\n    $$ y_{\\star} \\approx 2.6546 $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $y_{\\star} = \\beta_{\\star} D = 2.655$.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The stated definitions, operators, and constraints are standard in quantum statistical mechanics for describing a grand canonical ensemble of non-interacting fermions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to derive the equilibrium density operator $\\rho$ by maximizing the von Neumann entropy $S = -\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho)$ subject to the constraints on normalization, average energy, and average particle number. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The functional to be maximized is:\n$$\nL(\\rho) = S - \\lambda_{0}(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) - 1) - \\beta(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho H) - E) - \\gamma(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho N) - \\bar{N})\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{0}$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are Lagrange multipliers. For physical consistency with thermodynamics, we have pre-emptively identified the multiplier for the energy constraint as $\\beta$. We will later relate $\\gamma$ to the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\nTo find the maximum, we take the functional derivative of $L$ with respect to $\\rho$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta \\rho} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\rho} \\left( -\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho \\ln \\rho) - \\lambda_{0}\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) - \\beta\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho H) - \\gamma\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho N) \\right) = 0\n$$\nUsing the identity for the derivative of the trace, $\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta A}\\operatorname{Tr}(f(A)) = f'(A)^T$, and noting that $\\rho$, $H$, and $N$ are Hermitian, we get:\n$$\n-(\\ln \\rho + I) - \\lambda_{0}I - \\beta H - \\gamma N = 0\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity operator. Solving for $\\ln \\rho$:\n$$\n\\ln \\rho = -(\\lambda_{0}+1)I - \\beta H - \\gamma N\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the form of the density operator:\n$$\n\\rho = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{0}+1)I - \\beta H - \\gamma N)\n$$\nThe multiplier $\\lambda_0$ is determined by the normalization constraint $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\exp(-(\\lambda_{0}+1)I - \\beta H - \\gamma N)\\right) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{0}+1)) \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\exp(-\\beta H - \\gamma N)\\right) = 1\n$$\nThis implies $\\exp(-(\\lambda_{0}+1)) = \\frac{1}{Z}$, where $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta H - \\gamma N))$ is the grand canonical partition function. The density operator is thus:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(-\\beta H - \\gamma N)\n$$\nThe standard physical identification for the multiplier associated with the particle number $N$ is $\\gamma = -\\beta\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The equilibrium density operator, also known as the Gibbs state, is therefore:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp(-\\beta(H - \\mu N))\n$$\nwith the partition function $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta(H - \\mu N)))$.\n\nThe grand canonical Hamiltonian is $K = H - \\mu N$. Substituting the given expressions for $H$ and $N$:\n$$\nK = \\sum_{k} \\epsilon_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger}c_{k} - \\mu \\sum_{k} c_{k}^{\\dagger}c_{k} = \\sum_{k} (\\epsilon_{k} - \\mu) c_{k}^{\\dagger}c_{k}\n$$\nThe operators for different modes $k$ commute, i.e., $[c_k^\\dagger c_k, c_{k'}^\\dagger c_{k'}] = 0$ for all $k, k'$, because the operators for different modes anticommute. Thus, the grand Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting single-mode operators $K_k = (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k^\\dagger c_k$. This implies that the exponential of $K$ and thus the density operator $\\rho$ factorizes into a product over the modes:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\sum_k K_k\\right) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\prod_k \\exp(-\\beta K_k) = \\prod_k \\rho_k\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_k = \\frac{1}{Z_k} \\exp(-\\beta K_k)$ is the single-mode density operator and $Z_k = \\operatorname{Tr}_k(\\exp(-\\beta K_k))$ is the single-mode partition function. The total partition function is $Z = \\prod_k Z_k$.\n\nThe correlation matrix is defined as $C_{k k'} = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho\\, c_k^\\dagger c_{k'})$. We evaluate this by considering two cases.\n\nCase 1: $k \\neq k'$.\nThe trace can be written over the product Fock space of all modes.\n$$\nC_{k k'} = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\left(\\prod_j \\rho_j\\right) c_k^\\dagger c_{k'} \\right) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\rho_k c_k^\\dagger \\rho_{k'} c_{k'} \\prod_{j \\neq k, k'} \\rho_j \\right)\n$$\nSince the operators act on different Hilbert spaces, the trace can be separated:\n$$\nC_{k k'} = \\left(\\operatorname{Tr}_k(\\rho_k c_k^\\dagger)\\right) \\left(\\operatorname{Tr}_{k'}(\\rho_{k'} c_{k'})\\right) \\prod_{j \\neq k, k'} \\operatorname{Tr}_j(\\rho_j)\n$$\nBy construction, $\\operatorname{Tr}_j(\\rho_j)=1$ for any $j$. Let's evaluate $\\operatorname{Tr}_{k'}(\\rho_{k'} c_{k'})$. The Fock basis for mode $k'$ consists of the vacuum state $|0\\rangle_{k'}$ and the single-particle state $|1\\rangle_{k'}$. Any operator diagonal in the occupation number basis, such as $\\rho_{k'}$, has the form $A|0\\rangle\\langle 0| + B|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$. The operators $c_{k'}$ and $c_{k'}^\\dagger$ are purely off-diagonal in this basis: $c_{k'}|0\\rangle=0$, $c_{k'}|1\\rangle=|0\\rangle$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}_{k'}(\\rho_{k'} c_{k'}) = \\langle 0|_{k'} \\rho_{k'} c_{k'} |0\\rangle_{k'} + \\langle 1|_{k'} \\rho_{k'} c_{k'} |1\\rangle_{k'} = \\langle 0|_{k'} \\rho_{k'} (0) + \\langle 1|_{k'} \\rho_{k'} |0\\rangle_{k'} = 0\n$$\nThe last term is zero because $\\rho_{k'}$ is diagonal in the Fock basis $\\{|0\\rangle_{k'}, |1\\rangle_{k'}\\}$. Therefore, for $k \\neq k'$, $C_{k k'} = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $k = k'$.\nWe need to compute the diagonal elements $C_{k k} = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho\\, c_k^\\dagger c_k)$, which are the average occupation numbers $n_k$.\n$$\nn_k = C_{k k} = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( \\left(\\prod_j \\rho_j\\right) c_k^\\dagger c_k \\right) = \\left(\\operatorname{Tr}_k(\\rho_k c_k^\\dagger c_k)\\right) \\prod_{j \\neq k} \\operatorname{Tr}_j(\\rho_j) = \\operatorname{Tr}_k(\\rho_k c_k^\\dagger c_k)\n$$\nFor a single fermionic mode $k$, the number operator $n_k = c_k^\\dagger c_k$ has eigenvalues $0$ and $1$. The single-mode partition function $Z_k$ is:\n$$\nZ_k = \\operatorname{Tr}_k\\left(\\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)n_k)\\right) = \\sum_{n=0,1} \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)n)\n$$\n$$\nZ_k = \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\cdot 0) + \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\cdot 1) = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))\n$$\nThe average occupation number $n_k = \\langle n_k \\rangle$ is then:\n$$\nn_k = \\operatorname{Tr}_k(\\rho_k n_k) = \\frac{1}{Z_k} \\operatorname{Tr}_k\\left(n_k \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)n_k)\\right)\n$$\nThe trace is also a sum over the eigenvalues of $n_k$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}_k(\\dots) = \\sum_{n=0,1} n \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)n) = (0)\\exp(0) + (1)\\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)) = \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))\n$$\nCombining these results gives the average occupation number:\n$$\nn_k = C_{k k} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))$ yields the standard Fermi-Dirac distribution:\n$$\nC_{k k} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)) + 1}\n$$\nCombining the results for $k=k'$ and $k \\neq k'$ using the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{k k'}$, we obtain the final expression for the correlation matrix:\n$$\nC_{k k'} = \\delta_{k k'} \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)) + 1}\n$$\nThis result reflects that in the grand canonical ensemble of non-interacting fermions, the modes are uncorrelated, and the average occupation of each mode follows the Fermi-Dirac statistics.",
