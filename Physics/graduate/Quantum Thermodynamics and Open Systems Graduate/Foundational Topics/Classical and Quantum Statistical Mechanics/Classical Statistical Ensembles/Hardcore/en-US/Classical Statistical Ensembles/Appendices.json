A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe microcanonical ensemble at fixed energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$ is characterized by the constrained density of states, $\\omega(E,L)$. This quantity is proportional to the volume of the region of phase space defined by the constraints $H=E$ and $p_{\\phi}=L$. The phase space coordinates are $(r, \\phi, p_r, p_\\phi)$.\n\nThe density of states $\\omega(E,L)$ can be formally written as an integral over the entire phase space, using Dirac delta functions to enforce the constraints:\n$$\n\\omega(E,L) \\propto \\int dr \\, d\\phi \\, dp_r \\, dp_\\phi \\, \\delta(H - E) \\, \\delta(p_\\phi - L)\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian is $H = \\frac{p_r^2}{2m} + \\frac{p_\\phi^2}{2mr^2} + V(r)$. The potential $V(r)$ confines the particle to the region $0 \\le r < R$. Substituting the Hamiltonian and integrating over $p_\\phi$ gives:\n$$\n\\omega(E,L) \\propto \\int_0^R dr \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_r \\, \\delta\\left(\\frac{p_r^2}{2m} + \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - E\\right)\n$$\nThe integrand is independent of $\\phi$, so the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$.\n$$\n\\omega(E,L) \\propto 2\\pi \\int_0^R dr \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_r \\, \\delta\\left(\\frac{p_r^2}{2m} + \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - E\\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral over $p_r$, we use the property of the delta function: $\\int g(x) \\delta(f(x)) dx = \\sum_i \\frac{g(x_i)}{|f'(x_i)|}$, where $f(x_i)=0$. Here, $f(p_r) = \\frac{p_r^2}{2m} + \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - E$. The roots are $p_r = \\pm\\sqrt{2m\\left(E - \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}\\right)}$. The derivative is $f'(p_r) = \\frac{p_r}{m}$.\nThe integral over $dp_r$ becomes the sum over the two roots:\n$$\n\\int dp_r \\, \\delta(f(p_r)) = \\frac{1}{|p_{r,1}/m|} + \\frac{1}{|p_{r,2}/m|} = \\frac{2m}{|p_r|} = \\frac{2m}{\\sqrt{2m\\left(E - \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}\\right)}}\n$$\nThis expression is valid only if the argument of the square root is positive, which requires $E > \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}$. This condition sets the lower limit for the radial integration, $r_{min}$. We must have $r^2 > \\frac{L^2}{2mE}$, so $r_{min} = \\frac{|L|}{\\sqrt{2mE}}$. The particle is also confined by the hard wall at $r=R$. Thus, for the accessible phase space to be non-empty, we must have $r_{min} < R$, which implies $\\frac{|L|}{\\sqrt{2mE}} < R$, or $E > \\frac{L^2}{2mR^2}$. This defines the valid energy domain for this system.\n\nSubstituting the result of the $p_r$ integration, $\\omega(E,L)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\omega(E,L) \\propto \\int_{|L|/\\sqrt{2mE}}^R \\frac{2m}{\\sqrt{2m\\left(E - \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}\\right)}} dr = \\int_{|L|/\\sqrt{2mE}}^R \\frac{2mr}{\\sqrt{2mEr^2 - L^2}} dr\n$$\nLet's perform the integration. We can use the substitution $u = 2mEr^2 - L^2$, which gives $du = 4mE r dr$, so $r dr = \\frac{du}{4mE}$.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{2m}{\\sqrt{u}} \\left(\\frac{du}{4mE}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2E} \\int u^{-1/2} du = \\frac{1}{2E} (2u^{1/2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{u}}{E} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mEr^2 - L^2}}{E}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2mEr^2 - L^2}}{E} \\right]_{|L|/\\sqrt{2mE}}^R = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mER^2 - L^2}}{E} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE\\left(\\frac{L^2}{2mE}\\right) - L^2}}{E} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mER^2 - L^2}}{E}\n$$\nThus, the density of states is:\n$$\n\\omega(E,L) = C \\frac{\\sqrt{2mER^2 - L^2}}{E}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe Boltzmann entropy $S(E,L)$, up to an additive constant, is given by $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. We identify $\\Omega$ with $\\omega(E,L)$.\n$$\nS(E,L) = k_B \\ln\\left(C \\frac{\\sqrt{2mER^2 - L^2}}{E}\\right) = k_B \\ln(C) + k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2mER^2 - L^2}}{E}\\right)\n$$\nAs requested, we can neglect the additive constant $k_B \\ln(C)$.\n$$\nS(E,L) = k_B \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2mER^2 - L^2) - \\ln(E) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we compute the microcanonical temperature $T$ using the given definition:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E} \\right)_{L} = k_B \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2mER^2 - L^2) - \\ln(E) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} = k_B \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{2mER^2 - L^2} (2mR^2) - \\frac{1}{E} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} = k_B \\left[ \\frac{mR^2}{2mER^2 - L^2} - \\frac{1}{E} \\right]\n$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} = k_B \\left[ \\frac{mER^2 - (2mER^2 - L^2)}{E(2mER^2 - L^2)} \\right] = k_B \\left[ \\frac{L^2 - mER^2}{E(2mER^2 - L^2)} \\right]\n$$\nFinally, we invert this expression to find the temperature $T(E,L)$:\n$$\nT(E,L) = \\frac{1}{k_B} \\frac{E(2mER^2 - L^2)}{L^2 - mER^2}\n$$\nThe domain of energies for which this expression is valid is determined by the condition for the existence of a non-empty phase space, which we found to be $E > \\frac{L^2}{2mR^2}$. For this range of energies, the term $(2mER^2 - L^2)$ is always positive. The temperature $T$ is positive when the denominator $(L^2 - mER^2)$ is also positive, which occurs for $E < \\frac{L^2}{mR^2}$. For $E > \\frac{L^2}{mR^2}$, the temperature becomes negative, which is a valid physical result for this system under the Boltzmann entropy definition due to the non-monotonic behavior of the density of states. The expression for $T(E,L)$ itself is valid for the entire domain where the state is physically possible.\n\nThe domain of validity for the expression is therefore $E > \\frac{L^2}{2mR^2}$. The expression gives the temperature in Kelvin, as required, due to the factor of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, representing a standard and fundamental derivation in classical statistical mechanics. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n### Part 1: Justification and Expression for the Canonical Partition Function $Z_N(\\beta,V)$\n\nThe canonical partition function for a quantum system is given by the trace of the Boltzmann operator, $Z = \\text{Tr}(\\exp(-\\beta \\hat{H}))$, where $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The trace is taken over a complete basis of states for the $N$-particle Hilbert space. A foundational principle of quantum mechanics states that identical particles are indistinguishable. Consequently, the many-body wavefunctions must be either symmetric (for bosons) or antisymmetric (for fermions) under the exchange of any two particles. The trace must therefore be calculated using a basis of such (anti)symmetrized states.\n\nIn the classical, non-degenerate limit (high temperature and low density), the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the particles is much smaller than the average interparticle separation. In this regime, the probability of multiple particles occupying the same single-particle quantum state is negligible. The quantum statistics of both bosons and fermions converge to the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.\n\nThe transition from the quantum sum over discrete states to a classical integral over continuous phase space is achieved by two fundamental considerations:\n\n(i) **Quantum Coarse-Graining of Phase Space:** The Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously specified with arbitrary precision. The phase space for a single particle in one dimension is divided into cells of area $\\Delta q \\Delta p \\approx h$, where $h$ is Planck's constant. For $N$ particles in three dimensions, the $6N$-dimensional phase space is divided into elementary cells of volume $h^{3N}$. Therefore, the sum over quantum states can be approximated by an integral over phase space, with the measure $d^{3N}q \\, d^{3N}p$ rendered dimensionless by dividing by $h^{3N}$.\n\n(ii) **Indistinguishability and the Gibbs Factor:** If we were to integrate over the phase space of $N$ distinguishable particles, we would be overcounting the number of distinct physical microstates. Since the particles are identical, a configuration where particle $i$ has coordinates $(\\mathbf{q}_i, \\mathbf{p}_i)$ and particle $j$ has coordinates $(\\mathbf{q}_j, \\mathbf{p}_j)$ is physically identical to one where their coordinates are swapped. In the classical limit, where particles are almost always in different states, there are $N!$ such permutations of the $N$ particles that correspond to the same single quantum state. To correct for this overcounting, we must divide the classical phase-space integral by a factor of $N!$. This is known as the Gibbs correction factor.\n\nCombining these two principles, the canonical partition function for $N$ identical, non-interacting particles in the classical limit is given by:\n$$Z_N(\\beta, V) = \\frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \\int d^{3N}q \\int d^{3N}p \\, \\exp(-\\beta H(\\mathbf{q}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{q}_N, \\mathbf{p}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{p}_N))$$\n\n### Part 2: Evaluation of $Z_N(\\beta,V)$ for the Ideal Gas\n\nFor a monatomic ideal gas, the Hamiltonian consists only of the kinetic energy terms and is independent of particle positions: $H = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m}$. Substituting this into the expression for $Z_N$:\n$$Z_N = \\frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \\int d^{3N}q \\int d^{3N}p \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m}\\right)$$\nThe integral separates into a product of integrals over position and momentum coordinates.\nThe integral over the position coordinates gives:\n$$\\int d^{3N}q = \\left(\\int_V d^3q_1\\right) \\left(\\int_V d^3q_2\\right) \\dots \\left(\\int_V d^3q_N\\right) = V^N$$\nThe integral over the momentum coordinates also separates into a product of $N$ identical integrals, one for each particle:\n$$\\int d^{3N}p \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{p}_i^2\\right) = \\left[ \\int d^3p \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) \\right]^N$$\nThe single-particle momentum integral is a three-dimensional Gaussian integral. We can evaluate it by separating it into Cartesian components ($p^2 = p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2$):\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_x^2}{2m}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_y \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_y^2}{2m}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_z^2}{2m}\\right)$$\nUsing the standard result for a Gaussian integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, with $a = \\beta/(2m)$, each one-dimensional integral evaluates to $\\sqrt{2m\\pi/\\beta}$.

This is the expectation value of the observable $A$ in the ensemble defined by the original Hamiltonian $H$, which is equivalent to evaluating the expectation value in the $\\lambda$-perturbed ensemble, $\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}$, at the point $\\lambda = 0$.\n\nThe expectation value of $A$ in the perturbed ensemble is given by:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_{\\lambda} A) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})}{Z(\\lambda)} A \\right) = \\frac{1}{Z(\\lambda)} \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) \\right)\n$$\nwhere a cyclic property of the trace, $\\mathrm{Tr}(XY) = \\mathrm{Tr}(YX)$, was used in the last step.\n\nTo relate this to derivatives of $\\ln Z(\\lambda)$, we first compute the first derivative of $\\ln Z(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\ln Z(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{Z(\\lambda)} \\frac{d Z(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda}\n$$\nThe derivative of the partition function $Z(\\lambda)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d Z(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) \\right) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\exp(-\\beta (H + \\lambda A)) \\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate the derivative of the matrix exponential, we use the fact that $[A, H] = 0$. This implies that $[H + \\lambda A, -\\beta A] = [H, -\\beta A] + [\\lambda A, -\\beta A] = -\\beta[H, A] - \\beta\\lambda[A, A] = 0$. Since the operator exponent $-\\beta H_{\\lambda}$ commutes with its derivative with respect to $\\lambda$ (which is $-\\beta A$), the standard chain rule for differentiation applies:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) = \\left(\\frac{d(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})}{d\\lambda}\\right) \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) = (-\\beta A) \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{d Z(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d Z(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda} = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( -\\beta A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) \\right) = -\\beta \\, \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) \\right)\n$$\nNow we can write the derivative of $\\ln Z(\\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\ln Z(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{Z(\\lambda)} \\left( -\\beta \\, \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) \\right) \\right) = -\\beta \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}\\left( A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}) \\right)}{Z(\\lambda)}\n$$\nRecognizing the expression for $\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}$, we find the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\ln Z(\\lambda) = -\\beta \\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium expectation value for the unperturbed system, we evaluate this expression at $\\lambda = 0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\ln Z(\\lambda) \\right|_{\\lambda=0} = -\\beta \\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda=0} = -\\beta \\langle A \\rangle\n$$\nSolving for $\\langle A \\rangle$ yields the first required expression:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left. \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\ln Z(\\lambda) \\right|_{\\lambda=0}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the equilibrium variance $\\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$. We proceed by calculating the second derivative of $\\ln Z(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{d\\lambda^2} \\ln Z(\\lambda) = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\ln Z(\\lambda) \\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( -\\beta \\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda} \\right) = -\\beta \\frac{d\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}}{d\\lambda}\n$$\nWe must now differentiate $\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))}{Z(\\lambda)}$ using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{Z(\\lambda) \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})) - \\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})) \\frac{dZ(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda}}{[Z(\\lambda)]^2}\n$$\nThe derivative in the numerator is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(A \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})\\right) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(A (-\\beta A) \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})\\right) = -\\beta \\, \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(A^2 \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda})\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this, along with the previously found expression for $\\frac{dZ(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda} = -\\beta \\, \\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{Z(\\lambda)[-\\beta \\, \\mathrm{Tr}(A^2 \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))] - [\\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))][-\\beta \\, \\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))]}{[Z(\\lambda)]^2}\n$$\nFactoring out $-\\beta$ and separating the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}}{d\\lambda} = -\\beta \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(A^2 \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))}{Z(\\lambda)} - \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(A \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\lambda}))}{Z(\\lambda)}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nWe recognize the terms in the brackets as the expectation value of $A^2$ and the square of the expectation value of $A$, both in the perturbed ensemble:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}}{d\\lambda} = -\\beta \\left( \\langle A^2 \\rangle_{\\lambda} - \\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}^2 \\right) = -\\beta \\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle_{\\lambda}\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for the second derivative of $\\ln Z(\\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{d\\lambda^2} \\ln Z(\\lambda) = -\\beta \\frac{d\\langle A \\rangle_{\\lambda}}{d\\lambda} = -\\beta \\left( -\\beta \\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle_{\\lambda} \\right) = \\beta^2 \\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle_{\\lambda}\n$$\nTo find the variance for the unperturbed system, we evaluate this expression at $\\lambda = 0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2}{d\\lambda^2} \\ln Z(\\lambda) \\right|_{\\lambda=0} = \\beta^2 \\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle_{\\lambda=0} = \\beta^2 \\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle\n$$\nSolving for the variance $\\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle$ yields the second required expression:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta A)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} \\left. \\frac{d^2}{d\\lambda^2} \\ln Z(\\lambda) \\right|_{\\lambda=0}\n$$\nThese results show that the first and second cumulants of the observable $A$ can be systematically generated by differentiating the cumulant generating function, which is the logarithm of the generalized partition function.",
