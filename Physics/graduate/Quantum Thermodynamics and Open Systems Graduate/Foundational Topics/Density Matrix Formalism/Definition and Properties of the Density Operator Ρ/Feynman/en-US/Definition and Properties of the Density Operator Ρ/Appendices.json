            "problem": "In the setting of quantum thermodynamics and open quantum systems, the reduced state of a two-level system (a qubit) interacting with an environment at some fixed time is represented by a density operator $\\rho$ on a two-dimensional Hilbert space. By definition, a density operator is a linear operator that is Hermitian, positive semidefinite, and has unit trace. Any qubit operator can be expanded on the basis formed by the identity $\\mathbb{I}$ and the Pauli matrices $\\{\\sigma_{x},\\sigma_{y},\\sigma_{z}\\}$, which obey the algebra $\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j}=\\delta_{ij}\\mathbb{I}+i\\sum_{k}\\epsilon_{ijk}\\sigma_{k}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta and $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics, is well-posed with a clear objective, and is free of any contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. The task is to diagonalize a general qubit density operator and find its eigenvalues based on its fundamental properties and algebraic structure, which is a standard and formalizable problem in quantum information theory.\n\nLet the Hilbert space of the qubit be $\\mathcal{H}$, with $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}) = 2$. Any linear operator on $\\mathcal{H}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the identity operator $\\mathbb{I}$ and the three Pauli operators $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$, and $\\sigma_z$. We can write the set of Pauli operators as a vector $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$. The density operator $\\rho$ is, by definition, a Hermitian operator with unit trace.\n\nA general operator $A$ can be written as $A = c_0 \\mathbb{I} + \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, where $c_0$ is a complex number and $\\vec{c}$ is a complex vector.\nThe condition that $\\rho$ is Hermitian, $\\rho = \\rho^\\dagger$, requires the expansion coefficients to be real. This is because $\\mathbb{I}^\\dagger = \\mathbb{I}$ and $\\sigma_i^\\dagger = \\sigma_i$ for $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$. Thus, $\\rho$ must be of the form $\\rho = a_0 \\mathbb{I} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, where $a_0$ is a real number and $\\vec{a}$ is a real vector.\n\nThe condition that $\\rho$ has unit trace, $\\text{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$, allows us to determine the coefficient $a_0$. The Pauli operators are traceless, $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_i) = 0$, and the identity operator in two dimensions has a trace of $2$, $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbb{I}) = 2$.\nApplying the trace to the expansion of $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}(a_0 \\mathbb{I} + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = a_0 \\text{Tr}(\\mathbb{I}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_i) = 2a_0\n$$\nFor $\\text{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$, we must have $2a_0 = 1$, which implies $a_0 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nBy defining a new real vector $\\vec{r} = 2\\vec{a}$, we can write the general density operator for a qubit in the standard Bloch form:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})\n$$\nThe problem asks for the eigenvalues of this operator $\\rho$ in terms of the length of the Bloch vector, $r = \\lVert\\vec{r}\\rVert = \\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2}$. We are required to perform this derivation without selecting a specific basis. A purely algebraic method is most suitable.\n\nLet the eigenvalues of $\\rho$ be denoted by $\\lambda$. An operator satisfies its own characteristic equation. We can find a polynomial equation that $\\rho$ satisfies and then solve for its roots, which will be the eigenvalues. To do this, we compute $\\rho^2$:\n$$\n\\rho^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} (\\mathbb{I} + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\mathbb{I}^2 + 2(\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})\\mathbb{I} + (\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2 \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{I}$ is the identity, $\\mathbb{I}^2 = \\mathbb{I}$. The main term to evaluate is $(\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2$. This term can be expanded as:\n$$\n(\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2 = \\left( \\sum_{i=x,y,z} r_i \\sigma_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=x,y,z} r_j \\sigma_j \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} r_i r_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j\n$$\nWe use the provided Pauli algebra relation $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\delta_{ij}\\mathbb{I} + i\\sum_{k} \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k$. Substituting this into the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} r_i r_j \\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\sum_{i,j} r_i r_j \\left( \\delta_{ij}\\mathbb{I} + i\\sum_{k} \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} r_i r_j \\delta_{ij}\\mathbb{I} + i \\sum_{i,j,k} \\epsilon_{ijk} r_i r_j \\sigma_k\n$$\nThe first term simplifies due to the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} r_i r_j \\delta_{ij}\\mathbb{I} = \\sum_{i} r_i^2 \\mathbb{I} = (r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2)\\mathbb{I} = r^2 \\mathbb{I}\n$$\nThe second term involves the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$, which is antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two indices (e.g., $\\epsilon_{ijk} = -\\epsilon_{jik}$). The product $r_i r_j$ is symmetric in the indices $i$ and $j$. The sum of a product of a symmetric tensor ($r_i r_j$) and an antisymmetric tensor ($\\epsilon_{ijk}$) over the shared indices ($i,j$) is zero. Formally:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} \\epsilon_{ijk} r_i r_j = 0\n$$\nThis is because this sum represents the $k$-th component of the cross product $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{r}$, which is the zero vector.\nTherefore, we arrive at the crucial identity:\n$$\n(\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})^2 = r^2 \\mathbb{I}\n$$\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\rho^2$:\n$$\n\\rho^2 = \\frac{1}{4} (\\mathbb{I} + 2(\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) + r^2 \\mathbb{I}) = \\frac{1+r^2}{4}\\mathbb{I} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})\n$$\nOur goal is to find a polynomial in $\\rho$. We can express the term $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ using the definition of $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I} + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) \\implies \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma} = 2\\rho - \\mathbb{I}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our equation for $\\rho^2$:\n$$\n\\rho^2 = \\frac{1+r^2}{4}\\mathbb{I} + \\frac{1}{2}(2\\rho - \\mathbb{I}) = \\frac{1+r^2}{4}\\mathbb{I} + \\rho - \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{I}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho^2 = \\rho + \\left(\\frac{1+r^2}{4} - \\frac{2}{4}\\right)\\mathbb{I} = \\rho + \\frac{r^2-1}{4}\\mathbb{I}\n$$\nRearranging this gives a quadratic operator equation that $\\rho$ must satisfy:\n$$\n\\rho^2 - \\rho - \\frac{r^2-1}{4}\\mathbb{I} = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the operator $\\rho$ must be the roots of the corresponding scalar characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - \\frac{r^2-1}{4} = 0\n$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $\\lambda$ using the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c = -\\frac{r^2-1}{4}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)\\left(-\\frac{r^2-1}{4}\\right)}}{2(1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + (r^2-1)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{r^2}}{2}\n$$\nSince $r$ is the Euclidean norm (length) of the vector $\\vec{r}$, it is by definition non-negative, $r \\ge 0$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{r^2} = r$.\nThe two eigenvalues of the density operator $\\rho$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{1+r}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1-r}{2}\n$$\nThe final defining property of $\\rho$, positive semidefiniteness, requires all eigenvalues to be non-negative. This imposes the constraint $r \\le 1$ so that $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$, but the expression for the eigenvalues in terms of $r$ is independent of this constraint.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the density operator formalism. The definitions provided are standard and the tasks are well-posed, forming a logical progression from a specific example to a general proof. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires a rigorous, non-trivial derivation based on first principles as specified.\n\nA density operator $\\rho$ for a quantum system on the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^{2}$ is a linear operator $\\rho: \\mathbb{C}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{C}^{2}$ that satisfies three defining properties:\n1.  $\\rho$ is Hermitian: $\\rho = \\rho^{\\dagger}$.\n2.  $\\rho$ is positive semidefinite: $\\langle \\psi | \\rho | \\psi \\rangle \\ge 0$ for all vectors $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2}$.\n3.  $\\rho$ has unit trace: $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho) = 1$.\n\nSince $\\rho$ is a finite-dimensional Hermitian operator, the spectral theorem guarantees that it is diagonalizable and its eigenvalues are real. Let the eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. The positive semidefiniteness condition implies that these eigenvalues must be non-negative, $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge 0$. The unit trace condition, when evaluated in the eigenbasis of $\\rho$, becomes $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 1$.\n\nThe purity of the state $\\rho$ is given by $\\mathcal{P} = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho^{2})$. In the eigenbasis of $\\rho$, where $\\rho$ is diagonal with entries $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, the operator $\\rho^{2}$ is diagonal with entries $\\lambda_1^2$ and $\\lambda_2^2$. Therefore, the purity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues as $\\mathcal{P} = \\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2$.\n\n1. Construct an explicit example of a mixed state $\\rho$ with purity $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho^{2})=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe seek eigenvalues $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ that satisfy the constraints for a density operator and the specified purity condition. This gives the following system of equations:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\ge 0, \\quad \\lambda_2 \\ge 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\lambda_1$ from the first equation into the second gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_1^2 + (1 - \\lambda_1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_1^2 + (1 - 2\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_1^2) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n2\\lambda_1^2 - 2\\lambda_1 + 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n4\\lambda_1^2 - 4\\lambda_1 + 2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n4\\lambda_1^2 - 4\\lambda_1 + 1 = 0\n$$\nThis is a perfect square trinomial:\n$$\n(2\\lambda_1 - 1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThis equation has a unique solution $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Consequently, $\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\lambda_1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Both eigenvalues are non-negative, so this is a valid spectrum for a density operator.\n\nAn explicit example of a density operator with these eigenvalues is the one that is diagonal in the standard computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} I_2\n$$\nwhere $I_2$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. This is the maximally mixed state.\n\nTo justify that this is a mixed state, we must show it is not a pure state. A state is pure if and only if its density operator is a projector onto a one-dimensional subspace, which is equivalent to the condition of idempotency, $\\rho^2 = \\rho$. For our example:\n$$\n\\rho^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} I_2\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} I_2\n$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{4} I_2 \\neq \\frac{1}{2} I_2$, we have $\\rho^2 \\neq \\rho$. Thus, the state is not pure; it is mixed. Alternatively, a state is mixed if and only if its purity is strictly less than $1$. For this state, $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho^2) = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\frac{1}{4} I_2) = \\frac{1}{4} \\operatorname{Tr}(I_2) = \\frac{1}{4}(2) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}  1$, the state is confirmed to be mixed.\n\n2. Prove that the minimal purity for any density operator on $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe seek to find the minimum value of the purity $\\mathcal{P} = \\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2$ subject to the constraints on the eigenvalues of a density operator on $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2 \\ge 0\n$$\nWe can express the problem as a constrained minimization of a function of one variable. Using $\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\lambda_1$, the purity becomes a function of $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}(\\lambda_1) = \\lambda_1^2 + (1 - \\lambda_1)^2\n$$\nThe constraints $\\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\lambda_1 \\ge 0$ require that $\\lambda_1$ must lie in the closed interval $[0, 1]$. We need to find the minimum of $\\mathcal{P}(\\lambda_1)$ for $\\lambda_1 \\in [0, 1]$.\nExpanding the function:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}(\\lambda_1) = \\lambda_1^2 + 1 - 2\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_1^2 = 2\\lambda_1^2 - 2\\lambda_1 + 1\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $\\lambda_1$, representing an upward-opening parabola. The minimum is located at its vertex. We find the vertex by taking the first derivative with respect to $\\lambda_1$ and setting it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{P}}{d\\lambda_1} = 4\\lambda_1 - 2\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{d\\mathcal{P}}{d\\lambda_1} = 0$ yields $4\\lambda_1 - 2 = 0$, so $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince the critical point $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ is within the interval $[0, 1]$, and the second derivative $\\frac{d^2\\mathcal{P}}{d\\lambda_1^2} = 4  0$, this point corresponds to a global minimum.\nThe minimum value of the purity is obtained by substituting $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ back into the purity function:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{min}} = \\mathcal{P}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 1 + 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe maximum purity occurs at the boundaries of the interval: $\\mathcal{P}(0) = 1$ and $\\mathcal{P}(1) = 1$, corresponding to pure states. Thus, the minimal achievable purity for any density operator on $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n3. Conclude why no ensemble decomposition can make the purity smaller and identify the saturation condition.\n\nThe purity $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho^2)$ is a basis-independent property of the density operator $\\rho$ itself. Its value is uniquely determined by the spectrum (the set of eigenvalues) of $\\rho$. An ensemble decomposition, such as $\\rho = \\sum_i p_i |\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i|$ with $p_i \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_i p_i = 1$, is a description of how the state $\\rho$ might be prepared. Different decompositions can lead to the same final density operator $\\rho$. However, the purity is a function of the final state $\\rho$, not the specific path of its preparation.\n\nOur proof in part $2$ minimized the purity over all possible valid eigenvalue spectra for a density operator on $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$. We found a global minimum of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Since this minimum was derived from the fundamental constraints on $\\rho$ itself, it represents a lower bound for the purity of *any* physically-realizable density operator for a qubit. No matter what ensemble of pure states is used to construct $\\rho$, the resulting density operator will have a set of eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2\\}$ that satisfy $\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2=1$ and $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2 \\ge 0$. As proven, any such set of eigenvalues yields a purity $\\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, no ensemble decomposition can produce a state with purity smaller than this fundamental limit.\n\nThe condition on the spectrum that saturates this minimum is precisely the condition found at the minimum of the purity function: $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. This implies $\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The minimum purity is achieved if and only if the eigenvalues of the density operator are equal: $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is the defining spectral property of the maximally mixed state for a qubit.\n\nThe minimal achievable purity over all density operators on $\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}$.",

This is consistent with the fact that unitary transformations preserve the spectrum of $\\rho$, as the eigenvalues of $\\rho$ are $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 \\pm |\\vec{r}|)$.\n\nThe energy of any state $\\rho'$ accessible from $\\rho$ via a unitary transformation is given by:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle' = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho' H) = \\frac{\\omega r'_z}{2}\n$$\nwhere $r'_z$ is the z-component of the transformed Bloch vector $\\vec{r}'$. To find the minimum energy, we must find the minimum possible value of $r'_z$ under the constraint that $|\\vec{r}'| = |\\vec{r}|$. The set of all possible vectors $\\vec{r}'$accessible from $\\vec{r}$ through rotations forms a sphere of radius $R = |\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2}$ centered at the origin of the Bloch sphere.\n\nThe value of the expression $\\frac{\\omega r'_z}{2}$ is minimized by minimizing $r'_z$, since $\\omega  0$. For a vector $\\vec{r}'$ constrained to a sphere of radius $R$, its z-component $r'_z$ lies in the range $[-R, R]$. The minimum value is thus $-R$. This minimum is achieved when the vector $\\vec{r}'$ points along the negative z-axis, i.e., $\\vec{r}' = (0, 0, -R)$. This state is the passive state $\\rho_p$, and its Bloch vector is $\\vec{r}_p = (0, 0, -|\\vec{r}|)$.\n\nThe minimum energy is therefore:\n$$\n\\langle E \\rangle_{min} = \\frac{\\omega}{2} (\\min r'_z) = \\frac{\\omega}{2} (-|\\vec{r}|) = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ergotropy by subtracting the minimum energy from the initial energy:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}(\\rho,H) = \\langle E \\rangle_{initial} - \\langle E \\rangle_{min} = \\frac{\\omega r_z}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}(\\rho,H) = \\frac{\\omega}{2} \\left(r_z + \\sqrt{r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the closed-form analytic expression for the ergotropy of the given qubit system in terms of $\\omega$ and the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$.",
