A solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to determine the eigenvalues of the operator $\\rho(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})$. A direct but clumsy approach would be to write out the matrix representation and solve the characteristic equation. A more elegant and fundamental method, which adheres to the spirit of the problem statement, is to use the algebraic properties of the Pauli matrices.\n\nLet $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$ corresponding to an eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n$$ \\rho(\\vec{r}) |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\nLet us define the operator $M = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(I + M) |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\n$$ (I + M) |\\psi\\rangle = 2\\lambda |\\psi\\rangle $$\n$$ M |\\psi\\rangle = (2\\lambda - 1) |\\psi\\rangle $$\nThis shows that if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$, then $\\lambda' = 2\\lambda - 1$ is an eigenvalue of $M$. Conversely, if $\\lambda'$ is an eigenvalue of $M$, then $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\lambda')$ is an eigenvalue of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$. Our problem is thus reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the operator $M = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\nWe will find the eigenvalues of $M$ by first computing its square, $M^2$.\n$$ M^2 = (\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})^2 = (\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})(\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) $$\nA fundamental identity for the Pauli matrices is:\n$$ (\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})(\\vec{b}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) = (\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b})I + i(\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} $$\nwhere $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are any two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply this identity by setting $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b} = \\vec{r}$.\n$$ M^2 = (\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r})I + i(\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{r})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} $$\nThe cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector, so $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{r} = \\vec{0}$. The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its norm, $\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r} = |\\vec{r}|^2$. The identity simplifies to:\n$$ M^2 = |\\vec{r}|^2 I $$\nNow, let $\\lambda'$ be an eigenvalue of $M$ with corresponding eigenvector $|\\phi\\rangle \\neq 0$.\n$$ M|\\phi\\rangle = \\lambda'|\\phi\\rangle $$\nApplying the operator $M$ to both sides yields:\n$$ M^2|\\phi\\rangle = M(\\lambda'|\\phi\\rangle) = \\lambda' (M|\\phi\\rangle) = \\lambda'(\\lambda'|\\phi\\rangle) = (\\lambda')^2 |\\phi\\rangle $$\nUsing our result for $M^2$, we also have:\n$$ M^2|\\phi\\rangle = (|\\vec{r}|^2 I)|\\phi\\rangle = |\\vec{r}|^2 |\\phi\\rangle $$\nEquating the two expressions for $M^2|\\phi\\rangle$:\n$$ (\\lambda')^2 |\\phi\\rangle = |\\vec{r}|^2 |\\phi\\rangle $$\nSince $|\\phi\\rangle$ is a non-zero vector, we must have:\n$$ (\\lambda')^2 = |\\vec{r}|^2 $$\nThis equation for $\\lambda'$ has two solutions:\n$$ \\lambda' = \\pm \\sqrt{|\\vec{r}|^2} = \\pm |\\vec{r}| $$\nThese are the two eigenvalues of the operator $M = \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\nFinally, we use the relationship $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\lambda')$ to find the eigenvalues of the density operator $\\rho(\\vec{r})$.\nFor $\\lambda' = +|\\vec{r}|$, we obtain the first eigenvalue, which we denote $\\lambda_+$:\n$$ \\lambda_{+} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + |\\vec{r}|) $$\nFor $\\lambda' = -|\\vec{r}|$, we obtain the second eigenvalue, which we denote $\\lambda_-$:\n$$ \\lambda_{-} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - |\\vec{r}|) $$\nThese are the two eigenvalues of $\\rho(\\vec{r})$ expressed solely as a function of the norm $|\\vec{r}|$. The problem statement requires an ordered pair $(\\lambda_{+}, \\lambda_{-})$. As $|\\vec{r}| \\ge 0$, it is clear that $\\lambda_{+} \\ge \\lambda_{-}$, so this ordering is natural.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\frac{1 \\pm |\\vec{r}|}{2}$. The condition for positive semidefiniteness, $\\lambda_{\\pm} \\ge 0$, requires $1 \\pm |\\vec{r}| \\ge 0$. This implies $|\\vec{r}| \\le 1$, which is consistent with the constraint given in the problem statement. The trace is $\\text{Tr}(\\rho) = \\lambda_{+} + \\lambda_{-} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + |\\vec{r}|) + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - |\\vec{r}|) = 1$, as required for a density operator.

This is consistent with our definition of $C$.\n\nFor the shape of this packet to be invariant under time evolution generated by $\\hat{H}$, the variances $\\Delta x^2$ and $\\Delta p^2$ must be constant in time. This imposes a constraint on the possible values of these variances. The time evolution of the second moments of position and momentum is governed by a system of coupled differential equations. The condition for stationary variances ($\\frac{d\\Delta x^2}{dt}=0$, $\\frac{d\\Delta p^2}{dt}=0$) in a harmonic potential for a state that already has zero covariance (which is a defining feature of HUR-saturating states) is that the time derivative of the covariance must also be zero. The evolution equation for the covariance is $\\frac{d}{dt}\\text{cov}(x,p) = \\frac{\\Delta p^2}{m} - m\\omega^2\\Delta x^2$. For a stationary shape, we set this derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta p^2}{m} - m\\omega^2\\Delta x^2 = 0 \\implies \\Delta p^2 = m^2\\omega^2\\Delta x^2\n$$\nThis condition ensures dynamical compatibility. We must solve this simultaneously with the minimal-uncertainty condition $\\Delta x^2 \\Delta p^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}$. Substituting the dynamical condition into the uncertainty product:\n$$\n\\Delta x^2 (m^2\\omega^2 \\Delta x^2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} \\implies (\\Delta x^2)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4m^2\\omega^2}\n$$\nTaking the positive root, the unique dynamically compatible width is $\\Delta x^2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}$.\nThe parameter $C$ is thus uniquely determined: $C = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2(\\hbar/2m\\omega)} = m\\omega$.\nThe exponential term in the wavefunction becomes $-\\frac{C}{2\\hbar}(x-x_0)^2 = -\\frac{m\\omega}{2\\hbar}(x-x_0)^2$. Normalization requires $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1$, which sets the normalization constant to $N = (\\frac{m\\omega}{\\pi\\hbar})^{1/4}$. The explicit form of the wavefunction is:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = \\left(\\frac{m\\omega}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left(\\frac{ip_0x}{\\hbar} - \\frac{m\\omega}{2\\hbar}(x-x_0)^2\\right)\n$$\n\nPart 3: Variances of Dimensionless Quadratures\n\nThese dynamically compatible minimal-uncertainty states are known as coherent states. For these states, we have determined the variances:\n$$\n\\Delta x^2 = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p^2 = m^2\\omega^2 \\Delta x^2 = m^2\\omega^2 \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}\\right) = \\frac{m\\hbar\\omega}{2}\n$$\nThese variances are constant in time, confirming the shape-invariance.

The system consists of two spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles, so the total spin quantum number $s$ can be $s=0$ (singlet) or $s=1$ (triplet). The Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}=\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{2}$ decomposes into a direct sum of the corresponding eigenspaces: $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{H}_{s=0} \\oplus \\mathcal{H}_{s=1}$. The dimension of the singlet space $\\mathcal{H}_{s=0}$ is $1$, and the dimension of the triplet space $\\mathcal{H}_{s=1}$ is $3$.\n\nThe spectral decomposition of the identity operator on $\\mathcal{H}$ is $I = P_{0} + P_{1}$, where $P_{0}$ is the projector onto the singlet space and $P_{1}$ is the projector onto the triplet space. In terms of the total spin basis states $|s, m\\rangle$, these projectors are given by:\n$$\nP_{0} = |s=0, m=0\\rangle\\langle s=0, m=0|\n$$\n$$\nP_{1} = \\sum_{m=-1}^{+1} |s=1, m\\rangle\\langle s=1, m| = |1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| + |1, 0\\rangle\\langle 1, 0| + |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1|\n$$\nThe initial state of the system is given as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\bigl(|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle+|\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle\\bigr)$. Using the standard identification of the product basis states with the total spin basis states, we have $|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle = |1, 1\\rangle$ and $|\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle$. Thus, the initial state is:\n$$\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\bigl(|1, 1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle\\bigr)\n$$\nTo verify that this state lies entirely in the triplet eigenspace, we apply the projector $P_{1}$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$\nP_{1}|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( \\sum_{m'=-1}^{+1} |1, m'\\rangle\\langle 1, m'| \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\bigl(|1, 1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle\\bigr) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis states, $\\langle 1, m'|1, m\\rangle = \\delta_{m'm}$, the sum reduces to:\n$$\nP_{1}|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\bigl(|1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1|1, 1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1|1, -1\\rangle\\bigr) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\bigl(|1, 1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle\\bigr) = |\\psi\\rangle\n$$\nSince $P_{1}|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$, the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $P_{1}$ with eigenvalue $1$, which confirms that it is an element of the triplet eigenspace $\\mathcal{H}_{s=1}$. Consequently, the probability of obtaining the outcome $s=1$ upon measuring $S^2$ is $\\text{Tr}(P_{1} |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|) = \\langle\\psi|P_{1}|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. The initial density operator is $\\rho_{\\text{in}} = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$.\n\nSecond, we derive the post-measurement states for the two specified scenarios, conditioned on observing the outcome corresponding to $s=1$.\n\n(i) For an ideal Lüders instrument, the state update rule for an initial state $\\rho_{\\text{in}}$ and an outcome associated with projector $P_k$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P_{k} \\rho_{\\text{in}} P_{k}}{\\text{Tr}(P_{k} \\rho_{\\text{in}} P_{k})}\n$$\nIn our case, the outcome is $s=1$, so the projector is $P_{1}$. The post-measurement state $\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{P_{1} \\rho_{\\text{in}} P_{1}}{\\text{Tr}(P_{1} \\rho_{\\text{in}})}\n$$\nAs established, $P_{1}|\\psi\\rangle=|\\psi\\rangle$, which implies $\\langle\\psi|P_1 = \\langle\\psi|$. The numerator becomes $P_{1}|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|P_{1} = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi| = \\rho_{\\text{in}}$. The denominator is the probability, $\\text{Tr}(P_1 \\rho_{\\text{in}}) = 1$. Therefore, the post-measurement state is unchanged:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\rho_{\\text{in}} = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi| = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl(|1, 1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle\\bigr)\\bigl(\\langle 1, 1| + \\langle 1, -1|\\bigr)\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl( |1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| + |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1| + |1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1| + |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| \\bigr)\n$$\nThis is a pure state, maintaining the quantum coherence between the $|1, 1\\rangle$ and $|1, -1\\rangle$ components.\n\n(ii) For an ideal von Neumann measurement resolving the degeneracy, we measure the complete set of commuting observables $\\{S^2, S_z\\}$. The projectors for this refined measurement are $P_{s,m} = |s, m\\rangle\\langle s, m|$. The probability of obtaining the joint outcome $(s, m)$ is $p(s,m) = \\text{Tr}(P_{s,m} \\rho_{\\text{in}})$. The post-measurement state for this outcome is $|s, m\\rangle\\langle s, m|$.\nFor $s=1$, the possible values for $m$ are $+1, 0, -1$. The probabilities are:\n$$\np(1, 1) = \\text{Tr}(|1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| \\rho_{\\text{in}}) = |\\langle 1, 1|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\np(1, 0) = \\text{Tr}(|1, 0\\rangle\\langle 1, 0| \\rho_{\\text{in}}) = |\\langle 1, 0|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\np(1, -1) = \\text{Tr}(|1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1| \\rho_{\\text{in}}) = |\\langle 1, -1|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe total probability of measuring $s=1$ is $P(s=1) = p(1,1) + p(1,0) + p(1,-1) = \\frac{1}{2} + 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$. The coarse-grained state $\\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}}$ is constructed by forming a statistical mixture of the post-measurement states for each possible $m$, weighted by their conditional probabilities $p(m|s=1) = p(s=1, m) / P(s=1)$.\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}} = \\sum_{m=-1}^{+1} p(m|s=1) |1, m\\rangle\\langle 1, m| = \\frac{1/2}{1} |1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| + \\frac{0}{1} |1, 0\\rangle\\langle 1, 0| + \\frac{1/2}{1} |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1|\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl( |1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| + |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1| \\bigr)\n$$\nThis is a mixed state, where the coherence between the $|1, 1\\rangle$ and $|1, -1\\rangle$ components has been destroyed.\n\nThird, we compute the trace distance $D(\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}}, \\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}})$. The trace distance is defined as $D(\\rho_{1}, \\rho_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\rho_{1} - \\rho_{2}\\|_{1}$, where $\\|X\\|_{1}$ is the trace norm, equal to the sum of the singular values of $X$. For a self-adjoint operator, the singular values are the absolute values of its eigenvalues.\nLet's define the difference operator $\\Delta = \\rho_{\\mathrm{L}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}\\bigl( |1, 1\\rangle\\langle 1, -1| + |1, -1\\rangle\\langle 1, 1| \\bigr)\n$$\nThis operator is self-adjoint. It acts non-trivially only on the subspace spanned by $\\{|1, 1\\rangle, |1, -1\\rangle\\}$. In this basis, the matrix representation of $\\Delta$ is:\n$$\n[\\Delta] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle 1, 1|\\Delta|1, 1\\rangle  \\langle 1, 1|\\Delta|1, -1\\rangle \\\\ \\langle 1, -1|\\Delta|1, 1\\rangle  \\langle 1, -1|\\Delta|1, -1\\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda^{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = +\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$. The other two eigenvalues of $\\Delta$ in the full $4$-dimensional space are $0$, corresponding to eigenvectors orthogonal to this subspace (i.e., $|1,0\\rangle$ and $|0,0\\rangle$).\nThe trace norm of $\\Delta$ is the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\|\\Delta\\|_{1} = |\\lambda_{1}| + |\\lambda_{2}| + |0| + |0| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right| + \\left|-\\frac{1}{2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n$$\nFinally, the trace distance is:\n$$\nD(\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}}, \\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\rho_{\\mathrm{L}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{vN}}\\|_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis result quantifies the distinguishability between the pure state resulting from the Lüders update and the mixed state from the coarse-grained von Neumann measurement.",
