In the context of catalytic thermal operations, energy conservation leads to a time-translation covariance, which imposes powerful selection rules on the structure of the quantum channel describing the system's evolution. This exercise guides you through deriving these structural constraints from first principles, providing insight into which transitions are allowed or forbidden based solely on their associated energy differences, or Bohr frequencies . By completing this practice, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how fundamental symmetries shape the landscape of possible thermodynamic transformations.",

            "problem": "Consider a finite-dimensional quantum system $S$ with Hamiltonian $H_{S}$ having three distinct energy eigenvalues $E_{0}$, $E_{1}$, and $E_{2}$, which are evenly spaced as $E_{0} = 0$, $E_{1} = \\Delta$, and $E_{2} = 2 \\Delta$, where $\\Delta > 0$. The degeneracies of these energy levels are $g_{0} = 2$, $g_{1} = 3$, and $g_{2} = 2$, respectively. The system $S$ interacts with a heat bath $B$ at inverse temperature $\\beta$ and a catalyst $C$ via a global unitary $U$ such that $[U, H_{S} + H_{B} + H_{C}] = 0$. The catalyst $C$ is returned to its initial state at the end of the process, defining a catalytic thermal operation on $S$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the reduced dynamics on $S$ is a Completely Positive and Trace Preserving (CPTP) quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ that is covariant under time translations generated by $H_{S}$, i.e., for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\n\\exp(- i H_{S} t) \\, \\mathcal{E}(\\rho) \\, \\exp(i H_{S} t) \\;=\\; \\mathcal{E}\\!\\left(\\exp(- i H_{S} t) \\, \\rho \\, \\exp(i H_{S} t)\\right).\n$$\nThis covariance implies selection rules for the reduced channel: $\\mathcal{E}$ cannot mix operators belonging to different Bohr frequency sectors, where a Bohr frequency $\\omega$ is defined by differences of system energies, $\\omega = E_{i} - E_{j}$.\n\nWork in the energy-eigenoperator basis $\\{ |E_{i}, \\alpha \\rangle \\langle E_{j}, \\beta | \\}$ where $i,j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\{1,\\dots,g_{i}\\}$, $\\beta \\in \\{1,\\dots,g_{j}\\}$. The operator space decomposes into disjoint sectors labeled by Bohr frequencies $\\omega \\in \\{-2\\Delta, -\\Delta, 0, \\Delta, 2\\Delta\\}$, with each sector spanned by all basis elements $|E_{i}, \\alpha \\rangle \\langle E_{j}, \\beta |$ satisfying $E_{i} - E_{j} = \\omega$. Within each sector, the reduced channel may have nonzero matrix elements mapping between operators in the same sector, while all cross-sector elements must vanish due to covariance.\n\nStarting from the above physical constraints and definitions, derive the sector-wise selection rules and compute the total number $N_{\\text{allowed}}$ of distinct allowed operator-to-operator transitions in the matrix representation of $\\mathcal{E}$ with respect to the energy-eigenoperator basis, i.e., the total number of matrix entries that can be nonzero under the selection rules imposed by time-translation covariance and energy conservation, for the given degeneracies $g_{0} = 2$, $g_{1} = 3$, $g_{2} = 2$. Provide your final answer as a single integer. No rounding is required. The answer has no physical units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of allowed non-zero matrix elements in the representation of a quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ acting on a system $S$. The channel is constrained by time-translation covariance, which imposes specific selection rules.\n\nThe Hilbert space of the system $S$, denoted $\\mathcal{H}_S$, is composed of three energy eigenspaces. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_S$ is the sum of the degeneracies of its energy levels:\n$$d_S = g_{0} + g_{1} + g_{2} = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7$$\nThe channel $\\mathcal{E}$ is a linear map on the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_S$, denoted $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$. The dimension of this operator space is $d_S^2 = 7^2 = 49$. We will work in the basis of operators $\\{ |E_{i}, \\alpha \\rangle \\langle E_{j}, \\beta | \\}$, where $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, $\\alpha \\in \\{1, \\dots, g_i\\}$, and $\\beta \\in \\{1, \\dots, g_j\\}$. There are $d_S^2 = 49$ such basis operators.\n\nThe problem states that the channel $\\mathcal{E}$ is covariant with respect to time translations generated by the system Hamiltonian $H_S$. This is expressed by the commutation relation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} \\circ \\mathcal{U}_t = \\mathcal{U}_t \\circ \\mathcal{E}\n$$\nfor all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $\\mathcal{U}_t$ is the superoperator representing time evolution:\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}_t(\\rho) = \\exp(-i H_S t) \\rho \\exp(i H_S t)\n$$\nLet us analyze the action of $\\mathcal{U}_t$ on a basis operator $O_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta} = |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle \\langle E_j, \\beta|$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}_t(O_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta}) = \\exp(-i H_S t) |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle \\langle E_j, \\beta| \\exp(i H_S t)\n$$\nSince $|E_i, \\alpha\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_S$ with eigenvalue $E_i$, we have $H_S |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle = E_i |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle$, and thus $\\exp(-i H_S t) |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle = \\exp(-i E_i t) |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle$. Applying this, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}_t(O_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta}) = (\\exp(-i E_i t) |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle) (\\exp(i E_j t) \\langle E_j, \\beta|) = \\exp(-i(E_i - E_j) t) |E_i, \\alpha\\rangle \\langle E_j, \\beta|\n$$\nThe quantity $\\omega = E_i - E_j$ is the Bohr frequency associated with the operator $O_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta}$. The above equation shows that the basis operators $O_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta}$ are eigenvectors of the superoperator $\\mathcal{U}_t$ with eigenvalues $\\exp(-i \\omega t)$.\n\nThe covariance condition $[\\mathcal{E}, \\mathcal{U}_t]=0$ implies, by Schur's lemma, that $\\mathcal{E}$ cannot map between eigenspaces of $\\mathcal{U}_t$ corresponding to different eigenvalues. As the eigenvalues are determined by the Bohr frequencies $\\omega$, this means that $\\mathcal{E}$ can only map an operator with a given Bohr frequency to a linear combination of operators with the same Bohr frequency.\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(O_{ij}^{\\alpha\\beta}) = \\sum_{k,l,\\gamma,\\delta \\text{ s.t. } E_k-E_l = E_i-E_j} c_{kl\\gamma\\delta}^{ij\\alpha\\beta} O_{kl}^{\\gamma\\delta}\n$$\nThis means the matrix representation of $\\mathcal{E}$ in this basis is block-diagonal, where each block corresponds to a subspace of operators sharing the same Bohr frequency. The total number of allowed non-zero matrix elements, $N_{\\text{allowed}}$, is the sum of the number of elements in each of these blocks. If the dimension of the subspace (sector) corresponding to frequency $\\omega$ is $D_\\omega$, the corresponding block in the matrix of $\\mathcal{E}$ is a $D_\\omega \\times D_\\omega$ matrix, which has $D_\\omega^2$ elements. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{\\text{allowed}} = \\sum_{\\omega} D_\\omega^2\n$$\nWe must first identify the possible Bohr frequencies and then calculate the dimension $D_\\omega$ for each. The energy levels are $E_0=0$, $E_1=\\Delta$, and $E_2=2\\Delta$. The possible Bohr frequencies $\\omega = E_i - E_j$ are:\n$$\n\\omega \\in \\{E_0-E_0, E_1-E_1, E_2-E_2, E_1-E_0, E_2-E_1, E_0-E_1, E_1-E_2, E_2-E_0, E_0-E_2\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega \\in \\{0, 0, 0, \\Delta, \\Delta, -\\Delta, -\\Delta, 2\\Delta, -2\\Delta \\}\n$$\nThe distinct Bohr frequencies are $\\omega \\in \\{-2\\Delta, -\\Delta, 0, \\Delta, 2\\Delta\\}$.\n\nNow, we compute the dimension $D_\\omega$ of each sector, which is the number of basis operators $|E_i, \\alpha\\rangle\\langle E_j, \\beta|$ with $E_i - E_j = \\omega$.\nThe degeneracies are $g_0 = 2$, $g_1 = 3$, $g_2 = 2$.\n\n1.  Sector $\\omega=0$: This corresponds to $E_i - E_j = 0$, which means $i=j$. The transitions are within the same energy eigenspace.\n    - For $i=j=0$, the number of operators is $g_0 \\times g_0 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    - For $i=j=1$, the number of operators is $g_1 \\times g_1 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    - For $i=j=2$, the number of operators is $g_2 \\times g_2 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    The total dimension of this sector is $D_0 = g_0^2 + g_1^2 + g_2^2 = 4 + 9 + 4 = 17$.\n\n2.  Sector $\\omega=\\Delta$: This corresponds to $E_i - E_j = \\Delta$. The possible pairs are $(i,j)=(1,0)$ and $(i,j)=(2,1)$.\n    - For $(i,j)=(1,0)$, the number of operators is $g_1 \\times g_0 = 3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n    - For $(i,j)=(2,1)$, the number of operators is $g_2 \\times g_1 = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    The total dimension of this sector is $D_\\Delta = (g_1 g_0) + (g_2 g_1) = 6 + 6 = 12$.\n\n3.  Sector $\\omega=-\\Delta$: This corresponds to $E_i - E_j = -\\Delta$. The possible pairs are $(i,j)=(0,1)$ and $(i,j)=(1,2)$.\n    - For $(i,j)=(0,1)$, the number of operators is $g_0 \\times g_1 = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    - For $(i,j)=(1,2)$, the number of operators is $g_1 \\times g_2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n    The total dimension of this sector is $D_{-\\Delta} = (g_0 g_1) + (g_1 g_2) = 6 + 6 = 12$.\n\n4.  Sector $\\omega=2\\Delta$: This corresponds to $E_i - E_j = 2\\Delta$. The only possible pair is $(i,j)=(2,0)$.\n    - The number of operators is $g_2 \\times g_0 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    The total dimension of this sector is $D_{2\\Delta} = g_2 g_0 = 4$.\n\n5.  Sector $\\omega=-2\\Delta$: This corresponds to $E_i - E_j = -2\\Delta$. The only possible pair is $(i,j)=(0,2)$.\n    - The number of operators is $g_0 \\times g_2 = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    The total dimension of this sector is $D_{-2\\Delta} = g_0 g_2 = 4$.\n\nAs a check, the sum of the dimensions of all sectors should be the total dimension of the operator space: $D_0 + D_\\Delta + D_{-\\Delta} + D_{2\\Delta} + D_{-2\\Delta} = 17 + 12 + 12 + 4 + 4 = 49$, which equals $d_S^2$. The decomposition is correct.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of allowed transitions $N_{\\text{allowed}}$ by summing the squares of the dimensions of each block:\n$$\nN_{\\text{allowed}} = D_0^2 + D_\\Delta^2 + D_{-\\Delta}^2 + D_{2\\Delta}^2 + D_{-2\\Delta}^2\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{allowed}} = 17^2 + 12^2 + 12^2 + 4^2 + 4^2\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{allowed}} = 289 + 144 + 144 + 16 + 16\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{allowed}} = 289 + 288 + 32\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{allowed}} = 577 + 32 = 609\n$$\nThe total number of allowed operator-to-operator transitions is $609$.",
