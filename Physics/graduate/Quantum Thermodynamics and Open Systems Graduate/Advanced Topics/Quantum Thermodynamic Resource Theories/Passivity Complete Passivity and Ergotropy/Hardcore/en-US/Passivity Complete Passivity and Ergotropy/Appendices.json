In the framework of quantum resource theories for thermodynamics, extractable work by cyclic unitary control is defined as the decrease in average energy $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] - \\operatorname{Tr}[U \\rho U^{\\dagger} H]$ due to a unitary $U$ that acts only on the system.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two main results: first, to derive the necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum state to be passive with respect to a given Hamiltonian, and second, to apply this condition to a specific three-level system to determine its passivity and compute its ergotropy.\n\nLet the quantum system be described by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$, with dimension $d$. The system's Hamiltonian is given as $H = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} |E_{i}\\rangle\\langle E_{i}|$, where $\\{|E_{i}\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis of energy eigenvectors and $\\{E_{i}\\}$ are the corresponding energy eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are nondegenerate and ordered such that $E_{1}  E_{2}  \\dots  E_{d}$. The state of the system is described by a density operator $\\rho$.\n\nA state $\\rho$ is defined as passive if no work can be extracted from it by any cyclic unitary process. The work extracted by applying a unitary $U$ is the change in the average energy, $W = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] - \\operatorname{Tr}[U \\rho U^{\\dagger} H]$. Thus, a state $\\rho$ is passive if and only if for all unitary operators $U$ acting on $\\mathcal{H}$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] \\leq \\operatorname{Tr}[U \\rho U^{\\dagger} H]\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to stating that the state $\\rho$ has the minimum possible average energy among all states that are unitarily equivalent to it. Let $\\mathcal{O}_{\\rho} = \\{U \\rho U^{\\dagger} \\,|\\, U \\text{ is unitary}\\}$ be the orbit of $\\rho$ under the unitary group. Then $\\rho$ is passive if and only if $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] = \\min_{\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{O}_{\\rho}} \\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma H]$.\n\nLet us analyze the average energy $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma H]$ for any state $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{O}_{\\rho}$. Since $H$ is diagonal in the $\\{|E_i\\rangle\\}$ basis, the average energy is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma H] = \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\sigma \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} |E_{i}\\rangle\\langle E_{i}|\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} \\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma |E_{i}\\rangle\\langle E_{i}|] = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} \\langle E_{i} | \\sigma | E_{i} \\rangle\n$$\nThe quantity $\\langle E_{i} | \\sigma | E_{i} \\rangle$ is the $i$-th diagonal element of the matrix representation of $\\sigma$ in the energy eigenbasis. Let us denote this by $\\sigma_{ii}$. So, $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma H] = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} \\sigma_{ii}$.\n\nAll states $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{O}_{\\rho}$ are isospectral to $\\rho$, meaning they share the same set of eigenvalues. Let the spectral decomposition of $\\rho$ be $\\rho = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} p_{j} |p_{j}\\rangle\\langle p_{j}|$, where $\\{p_{j}\\}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\rho$ and $\\{|p_j\\rangle\\}$ are the corresponding eigenvectors. As $\\rho$ is a density operator, $p_j \\geq 0$ for all $j$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{d} p_j = 1$. Let us sort these eigenvalues in non-increasing order: $p_1^{\\downarrow} \\ge p_2^{\\downarrow} \\ge \\dots \\ge p_d^{\\downarrow}$.\n\nA fundamental result from matrix analysis, the Schur-Horn theorem, states that for a Hermitian matrix $\\sigma$, the vector of its diagonal elements, $(\\sigma_{11}, \\sigma_{22}, \\dots, \\sigma_{dd})$, is majorized by the vector of its eigenvalues, $(p_1^{\\downarrow}, p_2^{\\downarrow}, \\dots, p_d^{\\downarrow})$. We denote this by $(\\sigma_{ii}) \\prec (p_j^{\\downarrow})$.\n\nOur problem is now reduced to finding the minimum value of the expression $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} \\sigma_{ii}$ subject to the constraint that the vector $(\\sigma_{11}, \\dots, \\sigma_{dd})$ is majorized by the vector of eigenvalues of $\\rho$, $(p_1^{\\downarrow}, \\dots, p_d^{\\downarrow})$.\n\nWe can invoke the rearrangement inequality. For any two sets of real numbers $\\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^d$ and $\\{b_i\\}_{i=1}^d$, the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^d a_i b_i$ is minimized when one set is sorted in non-decreasing order and the other in non-increasing order. A more general result stemming from majorization theory states that for two vectors $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_d)$ and $y=(y_1, \\dots, y_d)$ such that $x \\succ y$, and for a sorted vector $a=(a_1, \\dots, a_d)$ with $a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\dots \\le a_d$, the inequality $\\sum_i a_i x_i^{\\downarrow} \\le \\sum_i a_i y_i$ holds, where $x_i^{\\downarrow}$ are the components of $x$ sorted non-increasingly. In our context, this translates to $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} p_i^{\\downarrow} \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i \\sigma_{ii}$ because the vector of energies $E=(E_1, \\dots, E_d)$ is sorted non-decreasingly and the vector of eigenvalues $p^{\\downarrow}=(p_1^{\\downarrow}, \\dots, p_d^{\\downarrow})$ is sorted non-increasingly, and $(\\sigma_{ii}) \\prec (p_j^{\\downarrow})$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible average energy for any state with the same spectrum as $\\rho$ is:\n$$\nE_{\\min} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} p_{i}^{\\downarrow}\n$$\nThis minimum is achieved when the diagonal elements $\\sigma_{ii}$ are precisely the sorted eigenvalues, i.e., $\\sigma_{ii} = p_i^{\\downarrow}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, d$. If the diagonal elements of a matrix are its eigenvalues, the matrix must be diagonal. Thus, the state that achieves this minimum energy is $\\rho_{\\text{pass}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_{i}^{\\downarrow} |E_{i}\\rangle\\langle E_{i}|$. This state is, by definition, passive.\n\nNow we can prove the necessary and sufficient condition.\n\n**Sufficiency ($\\Leftarrow$)**: Assume $\\rho$ is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, $\\rho = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i |E_i\\rangle\\langle E_i|$, and its populations $p_i$ are monotonically non-increasing with energy, i.e., $p_1 \\ge p_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge p_d$. The eigenvalues of this $\\rho$ are $\\{p_i\\}$, so $p_i = p_i^{\\downarrow}$. The energy of this state is $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i p_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i p_i^{\\downarrow} = E_{\\min}$. For any unitary $U$, the state $\\sigma = U \\rho U^{\\dagger}$ has energy $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\sigma H] = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i \\sigma_{ii}$. As shown above, $\\sum E_i \\sigma_{ii} \\ge \\sum E_i p_i^{\\downarrow} = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H]$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Tr}[U \\rho U^{\\dagger} H] \\ge \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H]$ for all $U$, which means $\\rho$ is passive.\n\n**Necessity ($\\Rightarrow$)**: Assume $\\rho$ is a passive state. By definition, its energy $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H]$ is the minimum possible among all states in its unitary orbit. We have shown this minimum is $E_{\\min} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i p_i^{\\downarrow}$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i \\rho_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_i p_i^{\\downarrow}$. Since $(\\rho_{ii}) \\prec (p_j^{\\downarrow})$ and $E_1  \\dots  E_d$, the equality holds if and only if the sequence $(\\rho_{11}, \\dots, \\rho_{dd})$ is a permutation of $(p_1^{\\downarrow}, \\dots, p_d^{\\downarrow})$ which is sorted in the same non-increasing order. Thus, it must be that $\\rho_{ii} = p_i^{\\downarrow}$ for all $i$. This means the diagonal elements of $\\rho$ in the energy basis are its own eigenvalues. This property implies that $\\rho$ must be diagonal in this basis. So, $\\rho = \\sum_i \\rho_{ii} |E_i\\rangle\\langle E_i|$. The populations $\\rho_{ii}$ are equal to $p_i^{\\downarrow}$, which are sorted non-increasingly: $\\rho_{11} \\ge \\rho_{22} \\ge \\dots \\ge \\rho_{dd}$. This completes the proof.\n\nNow, we consider the specific three-level system.\nThe Hamiltonian is $H = \\mathrm{diag}(0, \\epsilon, 2\\epsilon)$. The energy eigenvalues are $E_1 = 0$, $E_2 = \\epsilon$, and $E_3 = 2\\epsilon$. We assume $\\epsilon  0$, consistent with the non-degeneracy condition $E_1  E_2  E_3$.\nThe state is given as $\\rho = \\mathrm{diag}(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)$ in the energy eigenbasis.\n\nTo determine if $\\rho$ is passive, we check the two conditions from our derived theorem:\n1.  Is $\\rho$ diagonal in the energy eigenbasis? Yes, by its given form.\n2.  Are its populations (diagonal elements) monotonically non-increasing with energy? The populations are $p_1 = 0.5$, $p_2 = 0.3$, $p_3 = 0.2$. The corresponding energies are $E_1=0$, $E_2=\\epsilon$, $E_3=2\\epsilon$. We check the ordering: $p_1 = 0.5 \\ge p_2 = 0.3 \\ge p_3 = 0.2$. This condition is satisfied.\nSince both conditions are met, the state $\\rho$ is passive.\n\nFinally, we compute the ergotropy, which is the maximum extractable work:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}(\\rho) := \\max_{U} \\left( \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] - \\operatorname{Tr}[U \\rho U^{\\dagger} H] \\right) = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] - \\min_{U} \\operatorname{Tr}[U \\rho U^{\\dagger} H]\n$$\nThe minimum energy, as we established, is achieved by the passive state $\\rho_{\\text{pass}}$ that is isospectral to $\\rho$. The eigenvalues of the given $\\rho$ are $\\{0.5, 0.3, 0.2\\}$. Since these are already sorted non-increasingly, the passive state associated with this spectrum is $\\rho_{\\text{pass}} = \\mathrm{diag}(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)$, which is identical to the given state $\\rho$.\nTherefore, $\\rho = \\rho_{\\text{pass}}$.\nThe ergotropy is then:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}(\\rho) = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] - \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_{\\text{pass}} H] = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] - \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho H] = 0\n$$\nThis is consistent with the fact that $\\rho$ is a passive state, from which no work can be extracted.\n\nThe question asks for the value of $\\mathcal{W}(\\rho)/\\epsilon$.\nSince $\\mathcal{W}(\\rho) = 0$, the value is $\\mathcal{W}(\\rho)/\\epsilon = 0/\\epsilon = 0$.\nThe result is a pure number, as required.",

Let the system be prepared in a stationary state $\\rho$ that is diagonal in the energy basis with populations $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.3$, and $p_2=0.2$. The fundamental base for this problem comprises: (i) the definition of a passive state as one from which no work can be extracted by any cyclic unitary on a single copy, equivalently that the populations are nonincreasing with energy, (ii) the definition of a completely passive state as one from which no work can be extracted by cyclic unitaries on any number of copies, and (iii) the well-established characterization that the only completely passive states for a finite-dimensional nondegenerate Hamiltonian are Gibbs states of the form $\\rho_{\\beta}=\\exp(-\\beta H)/Z$ for some inverse temperature $\\beta$, where $Z=\\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H)]$.\n\nUsing only these principles, do the following:\n\n- Establish whether the single-copy state $\\rho$ is passive or not.\n- Establish whether $\\rho$ is completely passive or not by checking if there exists an inverse temperature $\\beta$ such that the given populations are consistent with a Gibbs distribution for the specified energy spacings.\n- Construct the two-copy system with total Hamiltonian $H^{(2)}=H\\otimes \\mathbb{I}+\\mathbb{I}\\otimes H$ and initial state $\\rho^{\\otimes 2}$.

The given populations are $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.3$, $p_2=0.2$ and the energies are $E_0=0E_1=1E_2=2.5$. The populations satisfy $p_0\\geq p_1\\geq p_2$, i.e., $0.5\\geq 0.3\\geq 0.2$.

Since $\\rho$ is diagonal in the energy basis, $\\rho^{\\otimes 2}$ is diagonal in the product energy basis $\\{|i\\rangle\\otimes|j\\rangle\\}$ with eigenvalues $p_i p_j$ and energies $E_i+E_j$.\n\nWe list all product basis elements, their energies, and their probabilities:\n- $|0\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle$: energy $0$, probability $0.5\\cdot 0.5=0.25$.\n- $|0\\rangle\\otimes|1\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle$: energy $1$, probabilities $0.5\\cdot 0.3=0.15$ each.\n- $|1\\rangle\\otimes|1\\rangle$: energy $2$, probability $0.3\\cdot 0.3=0.09$.\n- $|0\\rangle\\otimes|2\\rangle$, $|2\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle$: energy $2.5$, probabilities $0.5\\cdot 0.2=0.10$ each.\n- $|1\\rangle\\otimes|2\\rangle$, $|2\\rangle\\otimes|1\\rangle$: energy $3.5$, probabilities $0.3\\cdot 0.2=0.06$ each.\n- $|2\\rangle\\otimes|2\\rangle$: energy $5$, probability $0.2\\cdot 0.2=0.04$.\n\nSort the energies in ascending order and the probabilities in descending order:\n- Energies (with degeneracies): $0$ (one state), $1$ (two states), $2$ (one state), $2.5$ (two states), $3.5$ (two states), $5$ (one state).\n- Probabilities descending: $0.25$, $0.15$, $0.15$, $0.10$, $0.10$, $0.09$, $0.06$, $0.06$, $0.04$.\n\nAssign the largest probabilities to the lowest energies to construct the passive arrangement:\n- Energy $0$: assign $0.25$.\n- Energy $1$: assign $0.15$, $0.15$.\n- Energy $2$: assign $0.10$.\n- Energy $2.5$: assign $0.10$, $0.09$.\n- Energy $3.5$: assign $0.06$, $0.06$.\n- Energy $5$: assign $0.04$.\n\nCompute the minimal average energy under this arrangement:\n$$\n\\langle H^{(2)}\\rangle_{\\text{min}}=0\\cdot 0.25+1\\cdot(0.15+0.15)+2\\cdot 0.10+2.5\\cdot(0.10+0.09)+3.5\\cdot(0.06+0.06)+5\\cdot 0.04.\n$$\nEvaluate term by term:\n$$\n1\\cdot(0.15+0.15)=0.30,\\quad 2\\cdot 0.10=0.20,\\quad 2.5\\cdot(0.10+0.09)=2.5\\cdot 0.19=0.475,\n$$\n$$\n3.5\\cdot(0.06+0.06)=3.5\\cdot 0.12=0.42,\\quad 5\\cdot 0.04=0.20,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\langle H^{(2)}\\rangle_{\\text{min}}=0+0.30+0.20+0.475+0.42+0.20=1.595.\n$$\n\nThe maximum extractable work for two copies is therefore\n$$\nW_{2}=\\langle H^{(2)}\\rangle_{\\text{initial}}-\\langle H^{(2)}\\rangle_{\\text{min}}=1.6-1.595=0.005.\n$$\n\nThis is strictly positive, demonstrating activation of passivity: although one copy is passive (no work can be extracted), two copies allow work extraction. Expressing the final answer to four significant figures gives $5.000\\times 10^{-3}$ in the Hamiltonian’s energy units.",
