By working directly with the collective spin algebra, you will derive the transition rate for spontaneous emission as a function of the Dicke state quantum numbers, $J$ and $M$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the spontaneous emission transition rate, denoted here as $\\Gamma_{M \\to M-1}$, from a Dicke state $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$ to $\\lvert J,M-1\\rangle$ within the fully symmetric manifold of $N$ two-level atoms. The derivation will be based on the provided physical model and the formalism of the quantum master equation in the Lindblad form.\n\nThe system's dynamics are governed by a Markovian quantum master equation for the density operator $\\hat{\\rho}$. The problem states that the environment is the vacuum at zero temperature and that a single collective quantum jump operator, proportional to the collective spin-lowering operator $\\hat{J}_{-}$, describes the system's dissipative evolution. The Lindblad master equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}, \\hat{\\rho}] + \\mathcal{D}[\\hat{L}](\\hat{\\rho})\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}$ is the system Hamiltonian and $\\mathcal{D}[\\hat{L}]$ is the dissipator for the jump operator $\\hat{L}$. The dissipator has the form:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}[\\hat{L}](\\hat{\\rho}) = \\hat{L} \\hat{\\rho} \\hat{L}^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{L}^{\\dagger} \\hat{L} \\hat{\\rho} + \\hat{\\rho} \\hat{L}^{\\dagger} \\hat{L} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a single collective jump operator $\\hat{L}$ proportional to $\\hat{J}_{-}$. Let us write $\\hat{L} = \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\hat{J}_{-}$, where $\\kappa$ is a rate constant to be determined. The collective spin-lowering operator is defined as $\\hat{J}_{-} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(i)}$. Its Hermitian conjugate is the collective spin-raising operator, $\\hat{L}^{\\dagger} = \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\hat{J}_{+}$.\n\nTo determine the value of $\\kappa$, we consider the case of a single atom, where $N=1$. In this case, the collective operators reduce to the single-atom operators: $\\hat{J}_{-} \\to \\hat{\\sigma}_{-}$ and $\\hat{J}_{+} \\to \\hat{\\sigma}_{+}$. The master equation for a single two-level atom undergoing spontaneous emission into a vacuum environment is well-known and is characterized by the single-atom spontaneous emission rate $\\gamma_{0}$. The jump operator is $\\hat{L}_{1} = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{0}} \\hat{\\sigma}_{-}$.\n\nFor the collective system of $N$ atoms confined to a volume much smaller than the wavelength cubed ($V \\ll \\lambda^3$), all atoms couple identically and in-phase to the common electromagnetic field modes. The total system-environment interaction leads to a collective jump operator that is the sum of the individual contributions, scaled by the single-atom coupling strength. This results in a collective jump operator $\\hat{L} = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{0}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\hat{\\sigma}_{-}^{(i)} = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{0}} \\hat{J}_{-}$. Therefore, the rate constant $\\kappa$ is the single-atom spontaneous emission rate $\\gamma_{0}$.\n\nThe master equation for the collective system is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}, \\hat{\\rho}] + \\gamma_{0} \\left( \\hat{J}_{-} \\hat{\\rho} \\hat{J}_{+} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{J}_{+} \\hat{J}_{-} \\hat{\\rho} + \\hat{\\rho} \\hat{J}_{+} \\hat{J}_{-} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe transition rate from a pure state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ due to the action of a jump operator $\\hat{L}$ is given by the total rate of leaving that state, which is the expectation value of the operator $\\hat{L}^{\\dagger}\\hat{L}$ in that state. For our system initially in the Dicke state $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$, the transition rate is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{total}} = \\langle J,M | \\hat{L}^{\\dagger}\\hat{L} | J,M \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting $\\hat{L} = \\sqrt{\\gamma_{0}}\\hat{J}_{-}$, we get:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{total}} = \\langle J,M | (\\sqrt{\\gamma_{0}}\\hat{J}_{+}) (\\sqrt{\\gamma_{0}}\\hat{J}_{-}) | J,M \\rangle = \\gamma_{0} \\langle J,M | \\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-} | J,M \\rangle\n$$\nThe action of the operator $\\hat{J}_{-}$ on a Dicke state $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$ produces a state proportional to $\\lvert J,M-1\\rangle$. This means the total rate of leaving state $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$ corresponds entirely to the transition rate from $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$ to $\\lvert J,M-1\\rangle$. So, $\\Gamma_{M \\to M-1} = \\Gamma_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nTo evaluate the expectation value, we use the fundamental properties of angular momentum operators. The total angular momentum operator squared, $\\hat{J}^{2}$, can be expressed in terms of the raising, lowering, and $z$-component operators as:\n$$\n\\hat{J}^{2} = \\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-} + \\hat{J}_{z}^{2} - \\hat{J}_{z}\n$$\nRearranging for $\\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-}$, we find:\n$$\n\\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-} = \\hat{J}^{2} - \\hat{J}_{z}^{2} + \\hat{J}_{z}\n$$\nThe Dicke states $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$ are eigenstates of both $\\hat{J}^{2}$ and $\\hat{J}_{z}$:\n$$\n\\hat{J}^{2} \\lvert J,M\\rangle = J(J+1)\\hbar^2 \\lvert J,M\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{J}_{z} \\lvert J,M\\rangle = M\\hbar \\lvert J,M\\rangle\n$$\nIn this context, it is conventional to work in units where $\\hbar=1$, so the eigenvalues are $J(J+1)$ and $M$. Applying the operator $\\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-}$ to the state $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-} \\lvert J,M\\rangle = (\\hat{J}^{2} - \\hat{J}_{z}^{2} + \\hat{J}_{z}) \\lvert J,M\\rangle = (J(J+1) - M^{2} + M) \\lvert J,M\\rangle\n$$\nThe expectation value is therefore:\n$$\n\\langle J,M | \\hat{J}_{+}\\hat{J}_{-} | J,M \\rangle = (J(J+1) - M^{2} + M) \\langle J,M | J,M \\rangle = J(J+1) - M(M-1)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the transition rate:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{M \\to M-1} = \\gamma_{0} [J(J+1) - M(M-1)]\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring the polynomial in $J$ and $M$:\n$$\nJ(J+1) - M(M-1) = J^{2} + J - M^{2} + M = (J^{2} - M^{2}) + (J+M)\n$$\n$$\n= (J-M)(J+M) + (J+M) = (J+M)(J-M+1)\n$$\nThus, the general expression for the spontaneous emission transition rate from state $\\lvert J,M\\rangle$ to $\\lvert J,M-1\\rangle$ is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{M \\to M-1} = \\gamma_{0} (J+M)(J-M+1)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the transition rate as a function of $J$, $M$, and $\\gamma_0$.",

The emission rate from the localized excited state $|e_{j}\\rangle$ into $(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})$ is proportional to\n$$\n\\Gamma_{j}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})\\propto \\left| \\hat{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{d}_{j} \\right|^{2}=\\left| d\\,(\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}) \\right|^{2}=d^{2}\\,\\left| \\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j} \\right|^{2}.\n$$\nHence the incoherent sum weighted by the mixture probabilities $|c_{j}|^{2}$ is\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})\\propto \\sum_{j=1}^{N}|c_{j}|^{2}\\,d^{2}\\,\\left|\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}\\right|^{2}.\n$$\n\nDefine the collective enhancement factor as the ratio\n$$\n\\eta(\\hat{p};\\{\\hat{e}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\},\\{c_{j}\\})\\equiv \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{col}}(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})}{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{inc}}(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates and canceling common constants gives the closed-form expression\n$$\n\\eta(\\hat{p};\\{\\hat{e}_{j}\\},\\{\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\},\\{c_{j}\\})=\\frac{\\left|\\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\\,(\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j})\\,\\exp\\!\\left(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\right)\\right|^{2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N}|c_{j}|^{2}\\,\\left|\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}\\right|^{2}}.\n$$\nThis dimensionless factor compares the collectively enhanced rate for the coherent single-excitation state to the incoherent sum of single-atom rates into the same mode, explicitly capturing the impact of polarization mismatch via the factors $\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}$ and spatial phase factors via $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j})$.\n\nTo identify “dark polarizations,” note that emission into the selected $(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})$ mode is completely suppressed when the numerator vanishes:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\\,(\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j})\\,\\exp\\!\\left(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\right)=0.\n$$\nDefine the complex “collective dipole” vector\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{k})\\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\\,\\hat{e}_{j}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\right).\n$$\nThen the emission amplitude into $(\\mathbf{k},\\hat{p})$ is proportional to $\\hat{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{k})$. Because physical polarizations must satisfy $\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{k}=0$, the accessible $\\hat{p}$ form a two-dimensional space transverse to $\\hat{k}$. A polarization $\\hat{p}$ is dark if and only if it lies in the transverse subspace and is orthogonal to the transverse projection of $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{k}=0,\\quad \\hat{p}\\cdot\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\hat{k}\\hat{k}^{\\top}\\right)\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{k})\\right]=0,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. If $\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\hat{k}\\hat{k}^{\\top}\\right)\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{k})=\\mathbf{0}$, then both transverse polarizations are dark for that $\\mathbf{k}$; otherwise, exactly one transverse polarization (the one orthogonal to the transverse projection of $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{k})$) is dark and the orthogonal transverse polarization is bright.\n\nFor the special case of the symmetric single-excitation Dicke state (often called the “$W$ state”) with $c_{j}=1/\\sqrt{N}$, the overall factor $1/\\sqrt{N}$ cancels between numerator and denominator, yielding\n$$\n\\eta(\\hat{p})=\\frac{\\left|\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j})\\,\\exp\\!\\left(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\right)\\right|^{2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left|\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j}\\right|^{2}},\n$$\nand the same darkness condition applies with $c_{j}=1/\\sqrt{N}$. In all cases, the impact of polarization mismatch is encoded by the factors $(\\hat{p}\\cdot\\hat{e}_{j})$ in the numerator, which weight the coherent sum, versus their squared magnitudes in the denominator, which weight the incoherent reference. When all $\\hat{e}_{j}$ are identical and the phases are equal (small-sample Dicke limit $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\approx\\text{constant}$), $\\eta(\\hat{p})$ reduces to the familiar superradiant enhancement independent of polarization mismatch, whereas any dispersion in $\\hat{e}_{j}$ and/or spatial phases modulates the numerator and can create dark polarizations by destructive interference in the collective dipole.",
