            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is based on standard principles of the theory of open quantum systems, specifically non-Markovian dynamics governed by a Nakajima–Zwanzig master equation. All terms are mathematically well-defined, and the tasks are formalizable and solvable. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the evolution of the qubit coherence $\\rho_{01}(t)$. Second, we determine the conditions under which the resulting dynamical map is completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP).\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Decoherence Function $G(t)$**\n\nThe evolution of the density matrix $\\rho(t)$ is given by the integro-differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}K(t-\\tau)\\,\\rho(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\n$$\nThe memory kernel is $K(t)=\\Gamma \\exp(-\\gamma t)\\,\\mathcal{M}$, where $\\Gamma0$, $\\gamma0$, and the superoperator $\\mathcal{M}$ describes pure dephasing:\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}[\\rho]=\\sigma_{z}\\rho\\,\\sigma_{z}-\\rho\n$$\nWe work in the eigenbasis of the Pauli operator $\\sigma_z$, which is $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$. In this basis, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The density matrix is $\\rho(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}(t)  \\rho_{01}(t) \\\\ \\rho_{10}(t)  \\rho_{11}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the action of the superoperator $\\mathcal{M}$ on an arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{z}\\rho\\,\\sigma_{z} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}  \\rho_{01} \\\\ \\rho_{10}  \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}  -\\rho_{01} \\\\ -\\rho_{10}  \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}[\\rho] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}  -\\rho_{01} \\\\ -\\rho_{10}  \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}  \\rho_{01} \\\\ \\rho_{10}  \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -2\\rho_{01} \\\\ -2\\rho_{10}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe master equation acts only on the off-diagonal elements (coherences) of the density matrix. The populations $\\rho_{00}(t)$ and $\\rho_{11}(t)$ are constant in time. We focus on the upper off-diagonal element, $\\rho_{01}(t)$. The equation of motion for this element is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho_{01}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\Gamma \\exp(-\\gamma(t-\\tau)) (-2\\rho_{01}(\\tau)) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho_{01}(t) = -2\\Gamma \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-\\gamma(t-\\tau)) \\rho_{01}(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThis is a linear homogeneous integro-differential equation. The integral is a convolution of the functions $\\exp(-\\gamma t)$ and $\\rho_{01}(t)$. We solve this equation using the Laplace transform, denoted by $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\tilde{f}(s)$. Let $\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\rho_{01}(t)\\}$.\n\nApplying the Laplace transform to both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho_{01}(t)\\right\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{-2\\Gamma (\\exp(-\\gamma t) * \\rho_{01}(t))\\right\\}\n$$\nUsing the properties of the Laplace transform for derivatives and convolutions:\n$$\ns\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s) - \\rho_{01}(0) = -2\\Gamma \\mathcal{L}\\{\\exp(-\\gamma t)\\} \\mathcal{L}\\{\\rho_{01}(t)\\}\n$$\n$$\ns\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s) - \\rho_{01}(0) = -2\\Gamma \\frac{1}{s+\\gamma} \\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s)\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s) \\left(s + \\frac{2\\Gamma}{s+\\gamma}\\right) = \\rho_{01}(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s) \\left(\\frac{s(s+\\gamma) + 2\\Gamma}{s+\\gamma}\\right) = \\rho_{01}(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\rho}_{01}(s) = \\frac{s+\\gamma}{s^2 + \\gamma s + 2\\Gamma} \\rho_{01}(0)\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression of the form $\\rho_{01}(t) = G(t)\\rho_{01}(0)$. By definition, the decoherence function $G(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function $\\tilde{G}(s)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{G}(s) = \\frac{s+\\gamma}{s^2 + \\gamma s + 2\\Gamma}\n$$\nTo find $G(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\tilde{G}(s)\\}$, we analyze the roots of the quadratic denominator $s^2 + \\gamma s + 2\\Gamma = 0$. The roots are $s_{\\pm} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma}}{2}$. The behavior of the solution depends on the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta = \\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma$. It is convenient to introduce the parameter $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma}$.\n\nThe transfer function can be rewritten by completing the square in the denominator:\n$$\ns^2 + \\gamma s + 2\\Gamma = \\left(s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 + 2\\Gamma - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4} = \\left(s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma}\\right)^2 = \\left(s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 - \\Omega^2\n$$\nAnd the numerator can be written as:\n$$\ns+\\gamma = \\left(s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\n$$\nSo, we have:\n$$\n\\tilde{G}(s) = \\frac{s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}{\\left(s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 - \\Omega^2} + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\frac{1}{\\left(s+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2 - \\Omega^2}\n$$\nWe use the standard Laplace transform pairs:\n$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{s-a}{(s-a)^2-k^2}\\right\\} = \\exp(at)\\cosh(kt)$\n$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{k}{(s-a)^2-k^2}\\right\\} = \\exp(at)\\sinh(kt)$\n\nHere, $a=-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}$ and $k=\\Omega$. This gives:\n$$\nG(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}\\right)\\cosh(\\Omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\Omega} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}\\right)\\sinh(\\Omega t)\n$$\n$$\nG(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}\\right) \\left( \\cosh(\\Omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\Omega} \\sinh(\\Omega t) \\right)\n$$\nThis single expression for $G(t)$ is valid for all parameter regimes:\n1.  **Overdamped ($\\gamma^2  8\\Gamma$):** $\\Omega$ is real and positive. The expression remains as is.\n2.  **Critically damped ($\\gamma^2 = 8\\Gamma$):** $\\Omega \\to 0$. We take the limit: $\\lim_{\\Omega\\to 0} \\frac{\\sinh(\\Omega t)}{\\Omega} = t$ and $\\lim_{\\Omega\\to 0} \\cosh(\\Omega t) = 1$. This yields $G(t) = \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2})(1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}t)$.\n3.  **Underdamped ($\\gamma^2  8\\Gamma$):** $\\Omega$ is imaginary. Let $\\Omega = i\\omega$, where $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{8\\Gamma - \\gamma^2}$ is real. Using $\\cosh(i\\omega t) = \\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\sinh(i\\omega t) = i\\sin(\\omega t)$, the expression becomes $G(t) = \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2})(\\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2i\\omega} i\\sin(\\omega t)) = \\exp(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2})(\\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\omega}\\sin(\\omega t))$, which is real-valued.\n\nThus, the final unified expression for the decoherence function is:\n$$\nG(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}\\right) \\left[ \\cosh\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-8\\Gamma}\\right) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-8\\Gamma}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-8\\Gamma}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Conditions for a CPTP Map**\n\nA quantum evolution $\\rho(0) \\to \\rho(t) = \\Lambda_t[\\rho(0)]$ must be a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Trace Preservation (TP):**\nThe rate of change of the trace is $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho(t)) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\frac{d\\rho}{dt})$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dt}\\right) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} K(t-\\tau) \\rho(\\tau) d\\tau\\right) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\Gamma \\exp(-\\gamma(t-\\tau)) \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathcal{M}[\\rho(\\tau)]) d\\tau\n$$\nWe evaluate the trace of the generator part:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathcal{M}[\\rho]) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\sigma_z \\rho \\sigma_z - \\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\sigma_z \\rho \\sigma_z) - \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho)\n$$\nUsing the cyclic property of the trace, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\sigma_z\\rho\\sigma_z) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\sigma_z^2\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(I\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho)$.\nThus, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathcal{M}[\\rho]) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho) - \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho) = 0$.\nThis implies $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho(t)) = 0$, so $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho(t)) = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho(0))$ for all time. The map $\\Lambda_t$ is trace-preserving for all $\\Gamma, \\gamma$.\n\n**Complete Positivity (CP):**\nA map $\\Lambda_t$ is completely positive if and only if its Choi matrix, $C(\\Lambda_t) = (\\mathcal{I} \\otimes \\Lambda_t)[|\\Psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Psi^+|]$, is positive semi-definite. Here, $|\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)$ is a maximally entangled state on a bipartite system.\n\nThe dynamical map acts as $\\Lambda_t[\\rho] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}  G(t)\\rho_{01} \\\\ G(t)\\rho_{10}  \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix}$. We apply this to one subsystem (say, B) of the state $\\rho_{\\Psi^+} = |\\Psi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Psi^+| = \\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle\\langle00| + |00\\rangle\\langle11| + |11\\rangle\\langle00| + |11\\rangle\\langle11|)$.\nUsing the operator-sum representation of $\\rho_{\\Psi^+} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=0,1} |i\\rangle\\langle j|_A \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|_B$:\n$$\nC(\\Lambda_t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=0,1} |i\\rangle\\langle j|_A \\otimes \\Lambda_{t,B}(|i\\rangle\\langle j|_B)\n$$\nThe map acts on the basis operators as: $\\Lambda_t(|0\\rangle\\langle0|) = |0\\rangle\\langle0|$, $\\Lambda_t(|1\\rangle\\langle1|) = |1\\rangle\\langle1|$, $\\Lambda_t(|0\\rangle\\langle1|) = G(t)|0\\rangle\\langle1|$, and $\\Lambda_t(|1\\rangle\\langle0|) = G(t)|1\\rangle\\langle0|$.\nSubstituting these into the sum gives the Choi matrix:\n$$\nC(\\Lambda_t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( |0\\rangle\\langle0|\\otimes|0\\rangle\\langle0| + G(t)|0\\rangle\\langle1|\\otimes|0\\rangle\\langle1| + G(t)|1\\rangle\\langle0|\\otimes|1\\rangle\\langle0| + |1\\rangle\\langle1|\\otimes|1\\rangle\\langle1| \\right)\n$$\nIn the standard basis $\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}$, this corresponds to the matrix:\n$$\nC(\\Lambda_t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  G(t) \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ G(t)  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $C(\\Lambda_t)$ to be positive semi-definite, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative. The eigenvalues are $0, 0$ (from the middle block) and the eigenvalues of the submatrix $\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  G(t) \\\\ G(t)  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues of this submatrix are $\\frac{1}{2}(1 \\pm G(t))$.\nThe condition for complete positivity is therefore $1 \\pm G(t) \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $|G(t)| \\le 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nWe must check if this condition imposes any constraints on $\\Gamma$ and $\\gamma$. We analyze $G(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ with $\\Gamma  0, \\gamma  0$.\nWe note that $G(t)$ is the solution to the ODE $G'' + \\gamma G' + 2\\Gamma G = 0$ with initial conditions $G(0)=1$ and $G'(0)=0$. The initial condition $G'(0)=0$ follows directly from the original integro-differential equation. The second derivative at $t=0$ is $G''(0) = -\\gamma G'(0) - 2\\Gamma G(0) = -2\\Gamma  0$. Since $G(0)=1$, $G'(0)=0$, and $G''(0)0$, $t=0$ is a local maximum, and $G(t)$ initially decreases from $1$.\n\n- **Case $\\gamma^2 \\ge 8\\Gamma$ (overdamped and critically damped regimes):**\nThe derivative is $G'(t) = -e^{-\\gamma t/2} \\frac{2\\Gamma}{\\Omega} \\sinh(\\Omega t)$ (with the limit taken for the critical case). Since all parameters are positive and $\\sinh(x) \\ge 0$ for $x \\ge 0$, we have $G'(t) \\le 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The function is monotonically decreasing. Since $G(0)=1$ and $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} G(t)=0$, we have $0 \\le G(t) \\le 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The condition $|G(t)| \\le 1$ is satisfied.\n\n- **Case $\\gamma^2  8\\Gamma$ (underdamped regime):**\nThe function $G(t)$ oscillates with a decaying envelope. The local extrema occur when $G'(t)=0$.\n$G'(t) = -e^{-\\gamma t/2} \\frac{2\\Gamma}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t)$. The extrema are at $t_n = n\\pi/\\omega$ for integer $n \\ge 0$.\nThe values at these extrema are $G(t_n) = e^{-\\gamma n\\pi/(2\\omega)} \\cos(n\\pi) = (-1)^n e^{-\\gamma n\\pi/(2\\omega)}$.\nThe magnitude is $|G(t_n)| = e^{-\\gamma n\\pi/(2\\omega)}$. Since $\\gamma, \\omega  0$ and $n\\ge 0$, the exponent is non-positive. Thus, $|G(t_n)| \\le 1$ for all $n$.\nSince $G(t)$ starts at a maximum of $1$ and all its subsequent extrema have magnitude no larger than $1$, the function remains bounded by $[-1, 1]$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The condition $|G(t)| \\le 1$ is satisfied.\n\nIn all cases, for any given $\\Gamma0$ and $\\gamma0$, the condition $|G(t)| \\le 1$ is satisfied for all $t \\ge 0$. Therefore, the dynamical map $\\Lambda_t$ is completely positive and trace-preserving for all $t \\ge 0$ provided the given conditions $\\Gamma  0$ and $\\gamma  0$ hold. No further constraints are required.\n\nThe final answer required is the expression for $G(t)$.\n$$\nG(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}\\right) \\left[ \\cosh\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma}\\right) + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 8\\Gamma}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is valid for all parameter regimes, including the limiting case $\\gamma^2 = 8\\Gamma$.",

These probabilities are related to the Bloch damping factors $\\lambda_i(t)$ by:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_0(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\lambda_1(t)+\\lambda_2(t)+\\lambda_3(t)) \\\\\np_1(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\lambda_1(t)-\\lambda_2(t)-\\lambda_3(t)) \\\\\np_2(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\lambda_1(t)+\\lambda_2(t)-\\lambda_3(t)) \\\\\np_3(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\lambda_1(t)-\\lambda_2(t)+\\lambda_3(t))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_1(t) = \\lambda_2(t) = e^{-t}\\cosh(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+e^{-2t})$ and $\\lambda_3(t) = e^{-2t}$:\n$$\np_0(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(1+e^{-2t}) + e^{-2t}) = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 1+e^{-2t} + e^{-2t}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+e^{-2t}).\n$$\n$$\np_1(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\lambda_1(t)-\\lambda_1(t)-e^{-2t}) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-e^{-2t}).\n$$\n$$\np_2(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\lambda_1(t)+\\lambda_1(t)-e^{-2t}) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-e^{-2t}).\n$$\n$$\np_3(t) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(1+e^{-2t}) + e^{-2t}) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-(1+e^{-2t})+e^{-2t}) = 0.\n$$\nFor any $t \\geq 0$, $0  e^{-2t} \\leq 1$. Therefore, $p_0(t)  0$, $p_1(t) \\geq 0$, $p_2(t) \\geq 0$, and $p_3(t)=0$. Since all $p_\\mu(t) \\geq 0$ for $t \\in [0,T]$, the map $\\Phi(t)$ is completely positive for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\n\nNow, we prove trace-distance contractivity. The trace distance between two qubit states $\\rho_A$ and $\\rho_B$ with Bloch vectors $\\vec{r}_A$ and $\\vec{r}_B$ is $D(\\rho_A, \\rho_B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\vec{r}_A - \\vec{r}_B\\|$. For the evolved states $\\rho_A(t)$ and $\\rho_B(t)$, the distance is $D(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\vec{r}_A(t) - \\vec{r}_B(t)\\|$. Since $\\vec{r}(t) = \\Lambda(t)\\vec{r}(0)$ with $\\Lambda(t) = \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_1(t), \\lambda_2(t), \\lambda_3(t))$, we have $D(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\Lambda(t)(\\vec{r}_A(0)-\\vec{r}_B(0))\\|$. The dynamics is contractive if $\\frac{d}{dt}D(t) \\leq 0$ for all initial state pairs and for all $t \\in [0,T]$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\frac{d}{dt}\\|\\Lambda(t)\\vec{v}\\|^2 \\leq 0$ for any vector $\\vec{v}$. This holds if $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\lambda_i(t)^2) \\leq 0$ for each $i=1,2,3$.\nFor $i=3$: $\\lambda_3(t)^2 = e^{-4t}$. $\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-4t}) = -4e^{-4t}  0$ for all $t$.\nFor $i=1,2$: $\\lambda_1(t)^2 = (e^{-t}\\cosh(t))^2 = e^{-2t}\\cosh^2(t)$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\lambda_1(t)^2 = -2e^{-2t}\\cosh^2(t) + e^{-2t}(2\\cosh(t)\\sinh(t)) = 2e^{-2t}\\cosh(t)(\\sinh(t)-\\cosh(t)).\n$$\nUsing $\\sinh(t)-\\cosh(t) = -e^{-t}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\lambda_1(t)^2 = 2e^{-2t}\\cosh(t)(-e^{-t}) = -2e^{-3t}\\cosh(t).\n$$\nFor $t \\geq 0$, $e^{-3t}  0$ and $\\cosh(t) \\geq 1$, so $\\frac{d}{dt}\\lambda_1(t)^2  0$.\nSince the derivatives of all $\\lambda_i(t)^2$ are non-positive, the trace distance is a monotonically non-increasing function of time for any pair of initial states. The BLP non-Markovianity measure $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{BLP}}$ is defined as the integral over the revivals of distinguishability, $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{BLP}} = \\max_{\\rho_A,\\rho_B}\\int_{\\frac{dD}{dt}0} \\frac{dD(t)}{dt} dt$. As $\\frac{dD(t)}{dt} \\leq 0$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$, the integrand is never positive. Consequently, the BLP measure is zero: $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{BLP}}(0,T) = 0$.\n\nNext, we analyze the generator in canonical form and compute the RHP measure. The problem specifies using Hilbert-Schmidt orthonormal Lindblad operators $L_k = \\sigma_k/\\sqrt{2}$. The canonical GKSL form for a unital map is $\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\sum_k \\kappa_k(t) (L_k \\rho L_k^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\{L_k^\\dagger L_k, \\rho\\})$, where $\\kappa_k(t)$ are the canonical rates.\nSubstituting $L_k = \\sigma_k/\\sqrt{2}$ and $L_k^\\dagger L_k = \\mathbb{I}/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\kappa_k(t) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_k}{\\sqrt{2}} \\rho \\frac{\\sigma_k}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mathbb{I}}{2}, \\rho\\right\\}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\frac{\\kappa_k(t)}{2} (\\sigma_k \\rho \\sigma_k - \\rho).\n$$\nComparing this to the given master equation, $\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho(t)=\\sum_{k=1}^{3}\\gamma_{k}(t)\\bigl[\\sigma_{k}\\,\\rho(t)\\,\\sigma_{k}-\\rho(t)\\bigr]$, we identify the relationship $\\gamma_k(t) = \\frac{\\kappa_k(t)}{2}$, which implies $\\kappa_k(t) = 2\\gamma_k(t)$.\nThe canonical rates are:\n$\\kappa_1(t) = 2\\gamma_1(t) = 1$.\n$\\kappa_2(t) = 2\\gamma_2(t) = 1$.\n$\\kappa_3(t) = 2\\gamma_3(t) = -\\tanh(t)$.\nA dynamical map is CP-divisible if and only if all canonical rates $\\kappa_k(t)$ are non-negative for all time. Here, for $t0$, $\\tanh(t)0$, so $\\kappa_3(t)0$. The presence of a negative rate implies that the dynamics is not CP-divisible, hence it is non-Markovian in the RHP sense.\nThe RHP measure $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{RHP}}$ is the time integral of the sum of the absolute values of the negative rates:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{RHP}}(0,T) = \\int_0^T \\sum_k \\max(0, -\\kappa_k(t)) dt.\n$$\nFor our rates, only $\\kappa_3(t)$ can be negative:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{RHP}}(0,T) = \\int_0^T \\max(0, -(-\\tanh(t))) dt = \\int_0^T \\max(0, \\tanh(t)) dt.\n$$\nSince $\\tanh(t) \\geq 0$ for $t \\in [0,T]$ (with $T0$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{RHP}}(0,T) = \\int_0^T \\tanh(t) dt = [\\ln(\\cosh(t))]_0^T = \\ln(\\cosh(T)) - \\ln(\\cosh(0)) = \\ln(\\cosh(T)) - \\ln(1) = \\ln(\\cosh(T)).\n$$\nIn conclusion, the dynamics is completely positive for all $t$, yet it is not CP-divisible as revealed by the negative canonical rate $\\kappa_3(t)$, leading to a non-zero RHP measure $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{RHP}}(0,T) = \\ln(\\cosh(T))$. However, the map is always contractive with respect to the trace distance, which means it is P-divisible, resulting in a vanishing BLP measure $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{BLP}}(0,T) = 0$. This highlights the distinction between different notions of quantum non-Markovianity.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{RHP}}(0,T), \\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{BLP}}(0,T))$.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid and well-posed exercise in computational quantum physics. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of open quantum systems, specifically non-Markovian dynamics described by a Lorentzian spectral density. The problem is self-contained, providing two alternative but equivalent theoretical models—the pseudomode (PM) model and the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM)—and requests a numerical validation of their equivalence. All necessary parameters, initial conditions, and a clear metric for comparison are provided. The task adheres to the principles of scientific verifiability and logical consistency.\n\nThe core of the validation lies in demonstrating, first analytically and then numerically, that the two provided systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the excited-state amplitude $c_e(t)$ are mathematically identical.\n\nWe begin by establishing the analytical equivalence. The problem provides two models for the dynamics of the two-level system (TLS) amplitude $c_e(t)$ and an auxiliary amplitude.\n\nThe first model is the pseudomode (PM) representation, described by a set of coupled, first-order, linear ODEs for the TLS amplitude $c_e(t)$ and the pseudomode amplitude $b(t)$. In a frame rotating at the central frequency of the environmental mode, $\\omega_c$, the equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}c_e(t) = -i\\,g\\,b(t) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}b(t) = -\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}+i\\delta\\right)b(t) - i\\,g\\,c_e(t) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2})\n$$\nHere, $g$ is the TLS-pseudomode coupling strength, $\\kappa$ is the pseudomode damping rate, and $\\delta = \\Omega - \\omega_c$ is the detuning between the TLS transition frequency $\\Omega$ and the pseudomode frequency $\\omega_c$. The initial conditions are $c_e(0)=1$ and $b(0)=0$, corresponding to the TLS being initially excited and the environment (represented by the pseudomode) being in its vacuum state.\n\nThe second model is the first-tier Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) representation, suitable for an environment with an exponential correlation function. This is described by a coupled set of ODEs for $c_e(t)$ and a single auxiliary memory variable $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}c_e(t) = -g^2\\,y(t) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 3})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = c_e(t) - \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}+i\\delta\\right)y(t) \\quad (\\text{Eq. 4})\n$$\nThe initial conditions are specified as $c_e(0)=1$ and $y(0)=0$.\n\nOur objective is to show that these two systems are equivalent. We can achieve this by formally solving for $b(t)$ in the PM model and substituting it back into the equation for $\\dot{c}_e(t)$, thereby deriving the HEOM structure.\n\nLet $\\gamma = \\frac{\\kappa}{2}+i\\delta$. Equation (2) is a first-order inhomogeneous linear ODE for $b(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}b(t) + \\gamma\\,b(t) = -i\\,g\\,c_e(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be solved using the method of integrating factors. The solution for $b(t)$ with the initial condition $b(0)=0$ is given by:\n$$\nb(t) = e^{-\\gamma t} \\int_0^t e^{\\gamma \\tau} (-i\\,g\\,c_e(\\tau)) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nRearranging the exponential terms, we have:\n$$\nb(t) = -i\\,g \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma (t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting this formal solution for $b(t)$ into Equation (1) for $\\dot{c}_e(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}c_e(t) = -i\\,g \\left(-i\\,g \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma (t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}c_e(t) = -g^2 \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma (t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nThis is a non-Markovian integro-differential equation for $c_e(t)$, where the dynamics at time $t$ depend on the history of the amplitude $c_e(\\tau)$ for all $\\tau  t$.\n\nNow, let us examine the auxiliary variable $y(t)$ as defined in the problem statement for the HEOM derivation:\n$$\ny(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}+i\\delta)(t-\\tau)}\\,c_e(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)}\\,c_e(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\n$$\nBy comparing this definition with our derived equation for $\\dot{c}_e(t)$, we immediately obtain the first HEOM equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}c_e(t) = -g^2\\,y(t)\n$$\nThis matches Equation (3).\n\nNext, we must find the equation of motion for $y(t)$. We differentiate its definition with respect to time $t$ using the Leibniz integral rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n= \\left[ e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)}c_e(\\tau) \\right]_{\\tau=t} + \\int_0^t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)}c_e(\\tau) \\right) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nThe first term evaluates to $e^0 c_e(t) = c_e(t)$. The partial derivative inside the integral is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( e^{-\\gamma t} e^{\\gamma \\tau} c_e(\\tau) \\right) = -\\gamma e^{-\\gamma t} e^{\\gamma \\tau} c_e(\\tau) = -\\gamma e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau)\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\dot{y}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = c_e(t) + \\int_0^t \\left( -\\gamma e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau) \\right) \\,d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = c_e(t) - \\gamma \\int_0^t e^{-\\gamma(t-\\tau)} c_e(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nRecognizing the integral as the definition of $y(t)$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = c_e(t) - \\gamma y(t) = c_e(t) - \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2}+i\\delta\\right)y(t)\n$$\nThis matches Equation (4).\n\nFinally, the initial condition for $y(t)$ is found from its definition:\n$$\ny(0) = \\int_0^0 e^{-\\gamma(-\\tau)}c_e(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that the initial conditions are consistent across both models. Thus, we have analytically proven that the PM and single-tier HEOM descriptions are mathematically equivalent representations of the same underlying physical dynamics.\n\nFor numerical implementation, the complex-valued ODEs must be converted to real-valued systems.\nLet $c_e = c_{er} + i c_{ei}$, $b = b_r + i b_i$, and $y = y_r + i y_i$.\n\nFor the PM model, the system $\\vec{z}(t) = [c_{er}, c_{ei}, b_r, b_i]^T$ evolves according to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} c_{er} \\\\ c_{ei} \\\\ b_r \\\\ b_i \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  0  g \\\\\n0  0  -g  0 \\\\\n0  g  -\\kappa/2  \\delta \\\\\n-g  0  -\\delta  -\\kappa/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} c_{er} \\\\ c_{ei} \\\\ b_r \\\\ b_i \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwith initial condition $\\vec{z}(0) = [1, 0, 0, 0]^T$.\n\nFor the HEOM model, the system $\\vec{w}(t) = [c_{er}, c_{ei}, y_r, y_i]^T$ evolves as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} c_{er} \\\\ c_{ei} \\\\ y_r \\\\ y_i \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  -g^2  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  -g^2 \\\\\n1  0  -\\kappa/2  \\delta \\\\\n0  1  -\\delta  -\\kappa/2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} c_{er} \\\\ c_{ei} \\\\ y_r \\\\ y_i \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwith initial condition $\\vec{w}(0) = [1, 0, 0, 0]^T$.\n\nThe numerical procedure is to integrate both systems of ODEs from $t=0$ to $t=T$ using a high-precision solver. The excited-state population, $P_e(t) = |c_e(t)|^2 = c_{er}(t)^2 + c_{ei}(t)^2$, is calculated from the solution of each system. The final metric, $\\Delta$, is the maximum absolute difference between the two resulting population trajectories, $|P_e^{\\text{pm}}(t) - P_e^{\\text{heom}}(t)|$, over the time grid. Since the models are analytically equivalent, any non-zero $\\Delta$ will be attributable to the finite precision of the numerical integration.",
