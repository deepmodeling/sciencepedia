This exercise  uses the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism to derive the condition for a dephasing map to be completely positive, linking it directly to the dephasing rate $\\gamma(t)$. This establishes the foundational connection between the generator-level view (CP-divisibility) and the map-level signatures of non-Markovianity, such as information backflow.",

            "problem": "Consider a single qubit interacting with a dephasing environment so that its dynamics is generated by a time-local Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad (GKSL) master equation with a real, bounded rate $\\,\\gamma(t)\\,$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho(t)=\\frac{\\gamma(t)}{2}\\Big(\\sigma_{z}\\,\\rho(t)\\,\\sigma_{z}-\\rho(t)\\Big),\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{z}$ is the Pauli-$z$ operator. Let $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ denote the intermediate dynamical map propagating states from time $s$ to time $t$ (with $t\\ge s$), defined by $\\rho(t)=\\Lambda_{t,s}\\rho(s)$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definition of complete positivity via the Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism, the GKSL structure above, and the operational definition of the Breuer–Laine–Piilo (BLP) information backflow as the time derivative of the trace distance between two states, carry out the following:\n\n1. Solve the master equation at the level of matrix elements to obtain the scalar coherence-contraction factor $c(t,s)$ such that, for the off-diagonal elements in the computational basis, $\\rho_{01}(t)=c(t,s)\\,\\rho_{01}(s)$ and $\\rho_{10}(t)=c(t,s)\\,\\rho_{10}(s)$, while the populations are unchanged.\n\n2. Construct the Choi matrix $J_{t,s}$ of the intermediate map $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ using the maximally entangled state $|\\Phi\\rangle=(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ via $J_{t,s}=(\\Lambda_{t,s}\\otimes \\mathbb{I})\\big(|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|\\big)$, and compute its eigenvalues explicitly in terms of $c(t,s)$. Determine the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}(t,s)$.\n\n3. Using the complete positivity criterion that a linear map is completely positive if and only if its Choi matrix is positive semidefinite, show that for the qubit dephasing dynamics considered here, complete positivity of $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ reduces to the bound $0\\le c(t,s)\\le 1$. Explain how violations of this bound are related to the sign of the rate $\\gamma(t)$.\n\n4.

It represents a standard yet fundamental exercise in the theory of open quantum systems. All provided definitions and equations are standard in the field, and the tasks are logically structured, leading to a unique and verifiable solution. We may therefore proceed with solving the problem.\n\nLet the qubit density matrix in the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ be $\\rho(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}(t)  \\rho_{01}(t) \\\\ \\rho_{10}(t)  \\rho_{11}(t) \\end{pmatrix}$.

Coherence-Contraction Factor $c(t,s)$**\n\nWe solve these differential equations for the interval from an initial time $s$ to a final time $t$.\nThe equations for the diagonal elements (populations) imply they are constant in time:\n$$\n\\rho_{00}(t) = \\rho_{00}(s) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\rho_{11}(t) = \\rho_{11}(s)\n$$\nThe equations for the off-diagonal elements (coherences) are first-order linear ordinary differential equations. For $\\rho_{01}(t)$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\rho_{01}} d\\rho_{01} = -\\gamma(t) dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $s$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\rho_{01}(s)}^{\\rho_{01}(t)} \\frac{1}{\\rho_{01}} d\\rho_{01} = -\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{01}(t)}{\\rho_{01}(s)}\\right) = -\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{01}(t) = \\rho_{01}(s) \\exp\\left(-\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nThe solution for $\\rho_{10}(t)$ is identical due to the symmetry of the equations, and since $\\rho$ is Hermitian, $\\rho_{10} = \\rho_{01}^*$. Given $\\gamma(t)$ is real, if $\\rho_{01}(s)$ is real, $\\rho_{01}(t)$ remains real. In general:\n$$\n\\rho_{10}(t) = \\rho_{10}(s) \\exp\\left(-\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nBy comparing these solutions to the form required by the problem, $\\rho_{01}(t)=c(t,s)\\,\\rho_{01}(s)$, we identify the coherence-contraction factor as:\n$$\nc(t,s) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Choi Matrix $J_{t,s}$ and its Eigenvalues**\n\nThe dynamical map $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ acts on an arbitrary density matrix $\\rho$ as:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{t,s}(\\rho) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{00}  c(t,s)\\rho_{01} \\\\ c(t,s)\\rho_{10}  \\rho_{11} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Choi matrix $J_{t,s}$ is defined by applying the map to one part of a maximally entangled state. Let $|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$. The corresponding density operator is $|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi| = \\frac{1}{2}(|00\\rangle\\langle00| + |00\\rangle\\langle11| + |11\\rangle\\langle00| + |11\\rangle\\langle11|)$.\nUsing the identity $|ab\\rangle\\langle cd| = |a\\rangle\\langle c| \\otimes |b\\rangle\\langle d|$, we apply the map $(\\Lambda_{t,s} \\otimes \\mathbb{I})$:\n$$\n(\\Lambda_{t,s} \\otimes \\mathbb{I})(|a\\rangle\\langle c| \\otimes |b\\rangle\\langle d|) = \\Lambda_{t,s}(|a\\rangle\\langle c|) \\otimes |b\\rangle\\langle d|\n$$\nWe apply this to each term of $|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|$:\n- $(\\Lambda_{t,s}\\otimes\\mathbb{I})(|00\\rangle\\langle00|) = \\Lambda_{t,s}(|0\\rangle\\langle0|) \\otimes |0\\rangle\\langle0| = |0\\rangle\\langle0| \\otimes |0\\rangle\\langle0| = |00\\rangle\\langle00|$.\n- $(\\Lambda_{t,s}\\otimes\\mathbb{I})(|00\\rangle\\langle11|) = \\Lambda_{t,s}(|0\\rangle\\langle1|) \\otimes |0\\rangle\\langle1| = c(t,s)|0\\rangle\\langle1| \\otimes |0\\rangle\\langle1| = c(t,s)|00\\rangle\\langle11|$.\n- $(\\Lambda_{t,s}\\otimes\\mathbb{I})(|11\\rangle\\langle00|) = \\Lambda_{t,s}(|1\\rangle\\langle0|) \\otimes |1\\rangle\\langle0| = c(t,s)|1\\rangle\\langle0| \\otimes |1\\rangle\\langle0| = c(t,s)|11\\rangle\\langle00|$.\n- $(\\Lambda_{t,s}\\otimes\\mathbb{I})(|11\\rangle\\langle11|) = \\Lambda_{t,s}(|1\\rangle\\langle1|) \\otimes |1\\rangle\\langle1| = |1\\rangle\\langle1| \\otimes |1\\rangle\\langle1| = |11\\rangle\\langle11|$.\n\nSumming these up, the Choi matrix $J_{t,s}$ is:\n$$\nJ_{t,s} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Big( |00\\rangle\\langle00| + c(t,s)|00\\rangle\\langle11| + c(t,s)|11\\rangle\\langle00| + |11\\rangle\\langle11| \\Big)\n$$\nIn the standard basis $\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}$, this corresponds to the matrix:\n$$\nJ_{t,s} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  c(t,s) \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ c(t,s)  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is block-diagonal. Two eigenvalues are immediately seen to be $0$. The other two are the eigenvalues of the top-left and bottom-right $2\\times2$ block, $\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  c(t,s) \\\\ c(t,s)  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic equation is $(\\frac{1}{2}-\\lambda)^2 - (\\frac{c(t,s)}{2})^2 = 0$, which yields $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{c(t,s)}{2}$.\nThe four eigenvalues of $J_{t,s}$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1+c(t,s)}{2}, \\quad \\lambda_2 = \\frac{1-c(t,s)}{2}, \\quad \\lambda_3 = 0, \\quad \\lambda_4 = 0\n$$\nThe smallest eigenvalue is therefore $\\lambda_{\\min}(t,s) = \\min\\left(\\frac{1-c(t,s)}{2}, 0\\right)$. Assuming $c(t,s) \\leq 1$, the smallest eigenvalue is $\\frac{1-c(t,s)}{2}$. If $c(t,s)  1$, it becomes negative and is still the minimum. Therefore, in general, the smallest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\min}(t,s) = \\frac{1-c(t,s)}{2}$.\n\n**3. Complete Positivity and the Sign of $\\gamma(t)$**\n\nA linear map is completely positive (CP) if and only if its Choi matrix is positive semidefinite, meaning all its eigenvalues are non-negative.\nFor $J_{t,s}$ to be positive semidefinite, we must have $\\lambda_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$.\n- $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1+c(t,s)}{2} \\ge 0 \\implies c(t,s) \\ge -1$.\n- $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1-c(t,s)}{2} \\ge 0 \\implies c(t,s) \\le 1$.\n- $\\lambda_3=\\lambda_4=0$ are non-negative.\nSo, the map $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ is CP if and only if $-1 \\le c(t,s) \\le 1$.\nThe decoherence factor is $c(t,s) = \\exp(-\\int_s^t \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau)$. Since the exponent is real, $c(t,s)$ is always positive. Thus, the condition $c(t,s) \\ge -1$ is always satisfied. The CP condition for $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ reduces to $c(t,s) \\le 1$. The bound stated in the problem, $0 \\le c(t,s) \\le 1$, is thus equivalent to $c(t,s) \\le 1$.\n\nA violation of this bound, $c(t,s)1$, implies the map $\\Lambda_{t,s}$ is not completely positive.\n$$\nc(t,s)  1 \\iff \\exp\\left(-\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)  1 \\iff -\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau  0 \\iff \\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau  0\n$$\nFor the integral of $\\gamma(t)$ to be negative, $\\gamma(t)$ must be negative over some subinterval of $[s,t]$. The standard GKSL theory, which ensures a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) dynamical semigroup, requires $\\gamma(t) \\ge 0$ for all $t$. When this is violated, the dynamics are no longer guaranteed to be CP-divisible. A negative $\\gamma(t)$ is thus a signature of non-Markovianity and is the underlying cause for potential violations of the complete positivity of the finite-time map $\\Lambda_{t,s}$.\n\n**4. BLP Information Backflow Rate $\\sigma(t)$**\n\nWe consider the optimal pair of initial states, which are orthogonal and lie on the equator of the Bloch sphere. We choose the eigenstates of $\\sigma_x$:\n$\\rho_1(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I}+\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\rho_2(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbb{I}-\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nAt time $t$, these states evolve under the map $\\Lambda_{t,0}$ with decoherence factor $c(t,0) = \\exp(-\\int_0^t \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau)$.\n$$\n\\rho_1(t) = \\Lambda_{t,0}(\\rho_1(0)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  c(t,0) \\\\ c(t,0)  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_2(t) = \\Lambda_{t,0}(\\rho_2(0)) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -c(t,0) \\\\ -c(t,0)  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace distance is $D(\\rho_1(t), \\rho_2(t)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\rho_1(t)-\\rho_2(t)\\|_1$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$ is the trace norm (sum of absolute values of eigenvalues).\nThe difference is:\n$$\n\\rho_1(t) - \\rho_2(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 0  2c(t,0) \\\\ 2c(t,0)  0 \\end{pmatrix} = c(t,0) \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = c(t,0)\\sigma_x\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are $\\pm c(t,0)$. The trace norm is $|c(t,0)| + |-c(t,0)| = 2|c(t,0)|$.\nSince $c(t,0)$ is always positive, $|c(t,0)| = c(t,0)$. So the trace distance is:\n$$\nD(t) \\equiv D\\big(\\rho_{1}(t),\\rho_{2}(t)\\big) = \\frac{1}{2} (2 c(t,0)) = c(t,0) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nThe instantaneous rate of change of the trace distance, $\\sigma(t)$, is its time derivative:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} D(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right) = c(t,0) \\cdot (-\\gamma(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = -\\gamma(t) c(t,0) = -\\gamma(t)\\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nInformation backflow, a key signature of non-Markovianity, is defined by $\\sigma(t)0$. Since $c(t,0)$ is always positive, this occurs if and only if $\\gamma(t)0$.\nThe required expressions in terms of $\\gamma(t)$ and its integrals are:\n- Smallest eigenvalue: $\\lambda_{\\min}(t,s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\int_{s}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)\\right)$\n- BLP rate: $\\sigma(t) = -\\gamma(t)\\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma(\\tau)d\\tau\\right)$",

Analysis via CP-Divisibility**\n\nA dynamical map generated by a time-local GKLS master equation is completely positive (CP)-divisible if and only if all the decay rates in the generator are non-negative for all times. In this case, there is a single rate, $\\gamma(t)$.\n\nThe evolution is considered non-Markovian in the sense of violating CP-divisibility whenever this condition is not met, i.e., when $\\gamma(t)  0$. Given that $\\gamma(t) = \\alpha \\sin(\\omega t)$ and $\\alpha  0$, the condition for non-Markovianity simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sin(\\omega t)  0\n$$\nWe analyze this condition over a single period of the driving, $t \\in [0, T]$, where $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.

Analysis via the BLP Information Backflow Criterion**\n\nThe Breuer–Laine–Piilo (BLP) criterion quantifies non-Markovianity by the backflow of information from the environment to the system, which is signaled by an increase in the distinguishability of quantum states. The distinguishability is measured by the trace distance, $D(\\rho_1, \\rho_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}|\\rho_1 - \\rho_2|$. For any pair of initial states $\\rho_1(0)$ and $\\rho_2(0)$, a Markovian evolution (specifically, a CP-divisible one) implies that $D(\\rho_1(t), \\rho_2(t))$ is a non-increasing function of time. An increase in the trace distance, $\\frac{dD}{dt}  0$, signifies non-Markovian behavior.\n\nFirst, we solve the master equation. In the standard basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, the equation for the matrix elements yields that the populations $\\rho_{00}$ and $\\rho_{11}$ are constant, which is characteristic of pure dephasing. The off-diagonal elements (coherences) evolve according to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho_{01}(t)}{dt} = -\\gamma(t)\\rho_{01}(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation with the solution:\n$$\n\\rho_{01}(t) = \\rho_{01}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\gamma(s) ds\\right)\n$$\nLet's compute the integrated rate, which we denote as $\\Gamma(t)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(t) = \\int_0^t \\gamma(s) ds = \\int_0^t \\alpha\\sin(\\omega s) ds = \\alpha \\left[-\\frac{\\cos(\\omega s)}{\\omega}\\right]_0^t = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega}(1 - \\cos(\\omega t))\n$$\nThus, the coherences decay as $\\rho_{01}(t) = \\rho_{01}(0)\\exp(-\\Gamma(t))$.\n\nThe trace distance between two qubit states is given by $D(\\rho_1, \\rho_2) = \\frac{1}{2}|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|$, where $\\vec{r}_i$ are the Bloch vectors of the states. The evolution of the Bloch vector components for this dephasing channel is $r_x(t) = r_x(0)e^{-\\Gamma(t)}$, $r_y(t) = r_y(0)e^{-\\Gamma(t)}$, and $r_z(t) = r_z(0)$. The trace distance evolves as:\n$$\nD(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\Delta r_x(0)e^{-\\Gamma(t)})^2 + (\\Delta r_y(0)e^{-\\Gamma(t)})^2 + (\\Delta r_z(0))^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\Delta r_x(0)^2 + \\Delta r_y(0)^2)e^{-2\\Gamma(t)} + \\Delta r_z(0)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\vec{r}(0) = \\vec{r}_1(0) - \\vec{r}_2(0)$. To maximize the potential for information backflow, we must choose an initial pair of states for which the trace distance is most sensitive to changes in $\\Gamma(t)$. This is achieved by maximizing the prefactor of the term $e^{-2\\Gamma(t)}$. We set $\\Delta r_z(0) = 0$, meaning the initial states have the same populations. To maximize the initial distinguishability, we choose two orthogonal states, which makes $|\\Delta \\vec{r}(0)|=2$. The optimal states are therefore orthogonal and lie on the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere, for example $|\\psi_1(0)\\rangle = |+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$ and $|\\psi_2(0)\\rangle = |-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)$. For this pair, $D(0) = 1$.

Since $D(t)  0$, this requires $-\\gamma(t)  0$, or $\\gamma(t)  0$. This is precisely the same condition found for the violation of CP-divisibility: $t \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}, \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega})$.\n\nThe total information backflow, $\\mathcal{N}_{BLP}$, over one period is the total increase in trace distance, calculated by integrating $\\sigma(t)$ over the interval where it is positive:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{BLP} = \\int_{\\pi/\\omega}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\sigma(t) dt = \\int_{\\pi/\\omega}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\frac{dD(t)}{dt} dt\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, this integral is the net change in $D(t)$ over the interval:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{BLP} = D\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\right) - D\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate $D(t)$ at the endpoints of the backflow interval:\nAt $t = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$:\n$$\nD\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega}(1 - \\cos(\\pi))\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega}(1 - (-1))\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\nAt $t = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$:\n$$\nD\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega}(1 - \\cos(2\\pi))\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega}(1-1)\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the total information backflow accumulated over one period is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{BLP} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\nThis quantity is positive since $\\alpha  0$ and $\\omega  0$, confirming the existence of non-Markovianity as detected by the BLP measure.\n\nThe two required quantities are the fraction of the period with violated CP-divisibility and the total BLP backflow over one period.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is a valid, well-posed problem in the field of quantum thermodynamics and open systems. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Equations of Motion and P-Divisibility Condition\n\nThe starting point is the time-local master equation for the density operator $\\rho(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho(t) = \\sum_{i\\in\\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i(t)\\,\\big(\\sigma_i\\,\\rho(t)\\,\\sigma_i - \\rho(t)\\big)\n$$\nWe use the Bloch-vector representation $\\rho(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\mathbb{I} + \\vec{r}(t)\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}\\big)$, where $\\vec{r}(t) = (r_x(t), r_y(t), r_z(t))$ is the Bloch vector and $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli operators. The components of the Bloch vector are given by $r_k(t) = \\text{Tr}\\big(\\sigma_k \\rho(t)\\big)$.\n\nTo find the equations of motion for $r_k(t)$, we take the time derivative and use the master equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dr_k(t)}{dt} = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\sigma_k \\frac{d\\rho(t)}{dt}\\right) = \\sum_{i\\in\\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i(t) \\text{Tr}\\big(\\sigma_k (\\sigma_i \\rho(t) \\sigma_i - \\rho(t))\\big)\n$$\nUsing the cyclic property of the trace, $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k \\sigma_i \\rho(t) \\sigma_i) = \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_i \\sigma_k \\sigma_i \\rho(t))$. We use the identity for Pauli matrices $\\sigma_i \\sigma_k \\sigma_i = (2\\delta_{ik}-1)\\sigma_k$.\nIf $i=k$, $\\sigma_k \\sigma_k \\sigma_k = \\mathbb{I}\\sigma_k = \\sigma_k$. The identity gives $(2\\delta_{kk}-1)\\sigma_k = \\sigma_k$.\nIf $i \\neq k$, let $(i, k, j)$ be a cyclic permutation. Then $\\sigma_i \\sigma_k = - \\sigma_k \\sigma_i = -i\\sigma_j$. So $\\sigma_i \\sigma_k \\sigma_i = (-i\\sigma_j)\\sigma_i = -i(\\sigma_j \\sigma_i) = -i(-i\\sigma_k) = -\\sigma_k$. The identity gives $(2\\delta_{ik}-1)\\sigma_k = -\\sigma_k$.\nThe identity holds. Substituting it into the trace expression:\n$$\n\\frac{dr_k(t)}{dt} = \\sum_{i\\in\\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i(t) \\text{Tr}\\big( ( (2\\delta_{ik}-1)\\sigma_k - \\sigma_k) \\rho(t)\\big)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dr_k(t)}{dt} = \\left( \\sum_{i\\in\\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i(t) (2\\delta_{ik}-2) \\right) r_k(t)\n$$\nSince $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k \\rho(t)) = r_k(t)$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dr_k(t)}{dt} = \\left( \\sum_{i\\in\\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i(t) (2\\delta_{ik}-2) \\right) r_k(t)\n$$\nThe sum can be explicitly written for a given $k$. The term is non-zero only for $i\\neq k$, where $\\delta_{ik}=0$ and the factor is $-2$.\n$$\n\\frac{dr_k(t)}{dt} = -2\\left( \\sum_{i \\neq k} \\gamma_i(t) \\right) r_k(t)\n$$\nThis gives the decoupled equations of motion for the components of the Bloch vector:\n$$\n\\frac{dr_x(t)}{dt} = -2(\\gamma_y(t) + \\gamma_z(t)) r_x(t) \\\\\n\\frac{dr_y(t)}{dt} = -2(\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_z(t)) r_y(t) \\\\\n\\frac{dr_z(t)}{dt} = -2(\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_y(t)) r_z(t)\n$$\nThese are of the form $\\frac{dr_k(t)}{dt} = -\\kappa_k(t) r_k(t)$. The contraction rates are:\n$$\n\\kappa_x(t) = 2(\\gamma_y(t) + \\gamma_z(t)) \\\\\n\\kappa_y(t) = 2(\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_z(t)) \\\\\n\\kappa_z(t) = 2(\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_y(t))\n$$\nNext, we derive the condition for P-divisibility. The map is P-divisible if the infinitesimal propagator $\\Lambda_{t+\\delta t, t}$ is a positive map for all $t \\ge 0$. For an infinitesimally small time step $\\delta t  0$, the propagator is $\\Lambda_{t+\\delta t, t} \\approx \\mathbb{I} + \\mathcal{L}_t \\delta t$, where $\\mathcal{L}_t$ is the generator from the master equation.\n$$\n\\Lambda_{t+\\delta t, t}[\\rho] \\approx \\rho + \\delta t \\sum_i \\gamma_i(t)(\\sigma_i \\rho \\sigma_i - \\rho) = (1 - \\delta t \\sum_i \\gamma_i(t))\\rho + \\delta t \\sum_i \\gamma_i(t) \\sigma_i \\rho \\sigma_i\n$$\nThis is a Pauli channel. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda[\\rho] = \\sum_{k=0}^3 c_k \\sigma_k \\rho \\sigma_k$, with $\\sigma_0 = \\mathbb{I}$, is positive if and only if the following conditions on its coefficients $c_k$ are met:\n$c_0+c_1-c_2-c_3 \\ge 0$, $c_0-c_1+c_2-c_3 \\ge 0$, $c_0-c_1-c_2+c_3 \\ge 0$, and $\\sum_k c_k \\ge 0$.\nFor our infinitesimal map, the coefficients are $c_0 = 1 - \\delta t \\sum_{i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i(t)$ and $c_i = \\delta t \\gamma_i(t)$ for $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$.\n1. $\\sum_k c_k = (1 - \\delta t \\sum_i \\gamma_i) + \\delta t \\sum_i \\gamma_i = 1 \\ge 0$. This is always satisfied.\n2. $c_0+c_x-c_y-c_z = (1 - \\delta t(\\gamma_x+\\gamma_y+\\gamma_z)) + \\delta t \\gamma_x - \\delta t \\gamma_y - \\delta t \\gamma_z = 1 - 2\\delta t(\\gamma_y+\\gamma_z) \\ge 0$.\n3. $c_0-c_x+c_y-c_z = 1 - 2\\delta t(\\gamma_x+\\gamma_z) \\ge 0$.\n4. $c_0-c_x-c_y+c_z = 1 - 2\\delta t(\\gamma_x+\\gamma_y) \\ge 0$.\nFor these inequalities to hold for any arbitrarily small $\\delta t  0$, the coefficients of $\\delta t$ must be non-positive, or rather, the terms $2\\delta t (\\dots)$ must not be greater than $1$. In the limit $\\delta t \\to 0$, this requires:\n$$\n\\gamma_y(t) + \\gamma_z(t) \\ge 0 \\\\\n\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_z(t) \\ge 0 \\\\\n\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_y(t) \\ge 0\n$$\nThese are the necessary and sufficient conditions for P-divisibility. In terms of the contraction rates, this is equivalent to $\\kappa_x(t) \\ge 0$, $\\kappa_y(t) \\ge 0$, and $\\kappa_z(t) \\ge 0$.\n\n### Part 2: P-Divisibility vs CP-Divisibility\n\nWe are given the rates $\\gamma_x(t) = \\alpha$, $\\gamma_y(t) = \\alpha$, and $\\gamma_z(t) = -\\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$, with $\\alpha, \\beta, \\omega  0$. We apply the P-divisibility conditions derived above:\n1. $\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_y(t) = \\alpha + \\alpha = 2\\alpha \\ge 0$. Since $\\alpha  0$, this is always satisfied.\n2. $\\gamma_x(t) + \\gamma_z(t) = \\alpha - \\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t) \\ge 0$.\n3. $\\gamma_y(t) + \\gamma_z(t) = \\alpha - \\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t) \\ge 0$.\n\nConditions 2 and 3 are identical. For this inequality to hold for all times $t$, it must hold for the worst case, which is when $\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$ is maximal. The maximum value of $\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$ is $1$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n\\alpha - \\beta(1) \\ge 0 \\implies \\alpha \\ge \\beta\n$$\nThis is the condition on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that guarantees P-divisibility for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we examine CP-divisibility. A GKSL master equation $\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho(t) = \\sum_k \\gamma_k(t) \\mathcal{D}[L_k]\\rho$ is CP-divisible if and only if all rates $\\gamma_k(t)$ are non-negative for all $t$. The given master equation is in this canonical form with Lindblad operators $L_i = \\sigma_i$. Thus, for CP-divisibility, we need $\\gamma_i(t) \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$.\n- $\\gamma_x(t) = \\alpha \\ge 0$. This is true since $\\alpha  0$.\n- $\\gamma_y(t) = \\alpha \\ge 0$. This is also true.\n- $\\gamma_z(t) = -\\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$. Since $\\beta  0$, this rate is non-positive. It is negative whenever $\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)  0$.\n\nTherefore, on any interval where $\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)  0$, we have $\\gamma_z(t)  0$, which violates the condition for CP-divisibility. This means the dynamics fails to be CP-divisible. This conclusion holds irrespective of the condition $\\alpha \\ge \\beta$.\n\n### Part 3: RHP Non-Markovianity Measure\n\nThe Rivas–Huelga–Plenio (RHP) measure of non-Markovianity, for a dynamics in the canonical GKSL form, is defined as the time integral of the sum of the absolute values of the negative decoherence rates.\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\int_0^\\tau \\sum_k \\max(0, -\\gamma_k(t)) dt\n$$\nThe problem asks for this measure over one full period, $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. We evaluate the integrand for the given rates:\n- For $\\gamma_x(t) = \\alpha  0$: $\\max(0, -\\gamma_x(t)) = \\max(0, -\\alpha) = 0$.\n- For $\\gamma_y(t) = \\alpha  0$: $\\max(0, -\\gamma_y(t)) = \\max(0, -\\alpha) = 0$.\n- For $\\gamma_z(t) = -\\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$: $\\max(0, -\\gamma_z(t)) = \\max(0, -(-\\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t))) = \\max(0, \\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t))$.\nSince $\\beta  0$ and $\\sin^{2}(\\omega t) \\ge 0$, the term $\\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$ is always non-negative.\nSo, $\\max(0, \\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)) = \\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)$.\n\nThe RHP measure is the integral of the sum of these terms over the interval $[0, 2\\pi/\\omega]$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\left(0 + 0 + \\beta\\sin^{2}(\\omega t)\\right) dt = \\beta \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\sin^{2}(\\omega t) dt\n$$\nThis is the requested explicit integral. To evaluate it, we use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\beta \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\cos(2\\omega t)) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left[ t - \\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\sin(2\\omega t) \\right]_0^{2\\pi/\\omega}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} - \\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\sin\\left(2\\omega \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\right)\\right) - \\left(0 - \\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\sin(0)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} - \\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\sin(4\\pi) - 0 \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\sin(4\\pi) = 0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{RHP}} = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta \\pi}{\\omega}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the RHP non-Markovianity over one period.",
