We need the steady-state populations. For resonant driving ($\\Delta=0$), the coherent evolution of populations is mediated by a term proportional to $i\\Omega(\\rho_{23}-\\rho_{32})$. The steady state for the coherence $\\rho_{23}$ is found from $\\dot{\\rho}_{23}=0$:\n   $$0 = i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}(\\rho_{22}-\\rho_{33}) - \\gamma_t \\rho_{23} \\implies \\rho_{23} = \\frac{i\\Omega}{2\\gamma_t}(\\rho_{22}-\\rho_{33})$$\n   where $\\gamma_t=\\gamma_{pd}+\\frac12[\\Gamma_c(2n_c+1)+\\Gamma_h(2n_h+1)]$ is the total decay rate of the coherence $\\rho_{23}$.

We now need to solve the system of linear equations for the populations. After a lengthy but straightforward algebraic calculation, one can solve for $(\\rho_{22}-\\rho_{33})$:\n   $$J_{\\rm cool} = \\hbar\\omega_c W \\frac{\\Gamma_c\\Gamma_h(n_h - n_c)}{\\Gamma_c(n_c+1)[\\Gamma_h(n_h+1)+W] + \\Gamma_h n_h[\\Gamma_c n_c+W] + W[\\Gamma_c n_c + \\Gamma_h(n_h+1)]}$$\n   Collecting terms in $W$ in the denominator, this can be written in the form $J_{\\rm cool} = \\frac{A \\cdot W}{B + C \\cdot W}$, where $A, B, C$ are positive constants (for $n_h > n_c$):\n   $$J_{\\rm cool} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_c \\Gamma_c\\Gamma_h(n_h-n_c) \\cdot W}{\\Gamma_c\\Gamma_h(n_c+1)(n_h+1) + \\Gamma_h n_h \\Gamma_c n_c + W[\\Gamma_c(n_c+1)+\\Gamma_h n_h + \\Gamma_c n_c + \\Gamma_h(n_h+1)]}$$\n\n3. **Optimize with respect to $W$ (and $\\Omega$):** The cooling power has the form $f(W) = \\frac{A W}{B + C W}$. The derivative with respect to $W$ is:\n   $$\\frac{dJ_{\\rm cool}}{dW} = \\frac{A(B+CW) - ACW}{(B+CW)^2} = \\frac{AB}{(B+CW)^2}$$\n   Since $A>0$ and $B>0$, the derivative is always positive. This means $J_{\\rm cool}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $W$. Therefore, the maximum cooling power is achieved in the limit of infinite driving strength, $W \\to \\infty$ (which corresponds to $\\Omega \\to \\infty$).\n\n4. **Calculate the maximum power:**\n   $$J_{\\rm cool}^{\\max} = \\lim_{W\\to\\infty} \\frac{A W}{B + C W} = \\frac{A}{C}$$\n   The numerator constant is $A = \\hbar\\omega_c \\Gamma_c\\Gamma_h(n_h-n_c)$. The coefficient of $W$ in the denominator is $C = \\Gamma_c(n_c+1) + \\Gamma_h n_h + \\Gamma_c n_c + \\Gamma_h(n_h+1) = \\Gamma_c(2n_c+1) + \\Gamma_h(2n_h+1)$.
