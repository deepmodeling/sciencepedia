            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, situated within the standard framework of single-shot quantum thermodynamics and resource theories. It is complete, consistent, and requires a standard derivation and calculation. Thus, we proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Minimal Set of Inequalities\n\nThe condition for the single-shot state conversion $\\boldsymbol{p} \\to \\boldsymbol{q}$ under Thermal Operations (TO) for states diagonal in the energy basis is given by the thermo-majorization relation, denoted $\\boldsymbol{p} \\succ_{\\text{th}} \\boldsymbol{q}$. This relation can be expressed geometrically using thermo-majorization curves.\n\nLet the system have a Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} E_{i} |i\\rangle\\langle i|$ and be in contact with a heat bath at inverse temperature $\\beta$. A diagonal state is given by a probability distribution $\\boldsymbol{r} = (r_1, \\dots, r_d)$.\n\nFirst, we define the $\\beta$-order for a distribution $\\boldsymbol{r}$. This is determined by the permutation $\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}$ of the indices $\\{1, \\dots, d\\}$ that sorts the quantities $r_i \\exp(\\beta E_i)$ in non-increasing order:\n$$\nr_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(1)} \\exp(\\beta E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(1)}) \\ge r_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(2)} \\exp(\\beta E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(2)}) \\ge \\dots \\ge r_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(d)} \\exp(\\beta E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(d)})\n$$\n\nThe thermo-majorization curve, $C_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(x)$, for a state $\\boldsymbol{r}$ is a piecewise linear function on the interval $[0, Z_{\\beta}]$, where $Z_{\\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\exp(-\\beta E_i)$. The curve is constructed by connecting the points $(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{r}}, y_k^{\\boldsymbol{r}})$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, d$. These points, called breakpoints, are defined as follows:\n-   $(x_0^{\\boldsymbol{r}}, y_0^{\\boldsymbol{r}}) = (0, 0)$\n-   For $k=1, \\dots, d$:\n    $$ x_k^{\\boldsymbol{r}} = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\exp(-\\beta E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(j)}) $$\n    $$ y_k^{\\boldsymbol{r}} = \\sum_{j=1}^k r_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(j)} $$\nThe curve $C_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(x)$ is the linear interpolation between these consecutive breakpoints. The slope of the segment between $(x_{k-1}^{\\boldsymbol{r}}, y_{k-1}^{\\boldsymbol{r}})$ and $(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{r}}, y_k^{\\boldsymbol{r}})$ is given by $r_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(k)}/\\exp(-\\beta E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(k)}) = r_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(k)}\\exp(\\beta E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(k)})$. By definition of the $\\beta$-order, these slopes are non-increasing, which implies that $C_{\\boldsymbol{r}}(x)$ is a convex function.\n\nThe thermo-majorization condition $\\boldsymbol{p} \\succ_{\\text{th}} \\boldsymbol{q}$ is equivalent to the curve for $\\boldsymbol{p}$ lying nowhere below the curve for $\\boldsymbol{q}$:\n$$ C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x) \\ge C_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in [0, Z_{\\beta}] $$\nSince both functions are convex and they share the same endpoints $(0,0)$ and $(Z_{\\beta}, 1)$, this condition is satisfied if and only if the inequality holds at the breakpoints of the lower curve, $C_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(x)$.\n\nThus, the minimal set of inequalities that must be verified for the conversion $\\boldsymbol{p} \\to \\boldsymbol{q}$ to be possible is:\n$$ C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}}) \\ge y_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}} \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, \\dots, d-1. $$\nNote that $y_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = C_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}})$ by definition. The checks at $k=0$ and $k=d$ are trivial, as $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(0) = C_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(0) = 0$ and $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(Z_{\\beta}) = C_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(Z_{\\beta}) = 1$. The value of $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}})$ is found by evaluating the piecewise linear function $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x)$ at the abscissa $x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}}$.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Verification and Calculation\n\nWe are given a three-level system with $d=3$. The energies are $E_1=0$, $E_2=1$, and $E_3=2$, in units of $k_B T$, so we take $\\beta=1$. The states are $\\boldsymbol{p} = (0.7, 0.2, 0.1)$ and $\\boldsymbol{q} = (0.6, 0.25, 0.15)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Boltzmann factors $\\exp(-\\beta E_i)$:\n-   $\\exp(-\\beta E_1) = \\exp(-1 \\cdot 0) = 1$\n-   $\\exp(-\\beta E_2) = \\exp(-1 \\cdot 1) = \\exp(-1)$\n-   $\\exp(-\\beta E_3) = \\exp(-1 \\cdot 2) = \\exp(-2)$\n\nNext, we determine the $\\beta$-order for the target state $\\boldsymbol{q}$ by sorting $q_i \\exp(\\beta E_i)$:\n-   $i=1$: $q_1 \\exp(E_1) = 0.6 \\exp(0) = 0.6$\n-   $i=2$: $q_2 \\exp(E_2) = 0.25 \\exp(1)$\n-   $i=3$: $q_3 \\exp(E_3) = 0.15 \\exp(2)$\nSince $\\exp(1) \\approx 2.718$ and $\\exp(2) \\approx 7.389$, we have $0.25\\exp(1) \\approx 0.680$ and $0.15\\exp(2) \\approx 1.108$.\nThus, $q_3 \\exp(E_3) > q_2 \\exp(E_2) > q_1 \\exp(E_1)$. The $\\beta$-order for $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is given by the permutation $\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{q}} = (3, 2, 1)$.\n\nThe breakpoints of the curve $C_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(x)$ are determined by this order. The minimal set of inequalities needs to be checked at $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n-   For $k=1$:\n    $x_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = \\exp(-E_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(1)}) = \\exp(-E_3) = \\exp(-2)$\n    $y_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = q_{\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{q}}(1)} = q_3 = 0.15$\n-   For $k=2$:\n    $x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = \\exp(-E_3) + \\exp(-E_2) = \\exp(-2) + \\exp(-1)$\n    $y_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = q_3 + q_2 = 0.15 + 0.25 = 0.40$\n\nTo evaluate the inequalities, we must compute $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}})$. This requires the thermo-majorization curve for $\\boldsymbol{p}$, so we first find its $\\beta$-order by sorting $p_i \\exp(E_i)$:\n-   $i=1$: $p_1 \\exp(E_1) = 0.7 \\exp(0) = 0.7$\n-   $i=2$: $p_2 \\exp(E_2) = 0.2 \\exp(1) \\approx 0.544$\n-   $i=3$: $p_3 \\exp(E_3) = 0.1 \\exp(2) \\approx 0.739$\nThus, $p_3 \\exp(E_3) > p_1 \\exp(E_1) > p_2 \\exp(E_2)$. The $\\beta$-order for $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is $\\pi_{\\boldsymbol{p}} = (3, 1, 2)$.\n\nThe breakpoints for $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x)$ are:\n-   $(x_0^{\\boldsymbol{p}}, y_0^{\\boldsymbol{p}}) = (0, 0)$\n-   $k=1$: $x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = \\exp(-E_3) = \\exp(-2)$, and $y_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = p_3 = 0.1$.\n-   $k=2$: $x_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = \\exp(-E_3) + \\exp(-E_1) = \\exp(-2) + 1$, and $y_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = p_3 + p_1 = 0.1 + 0.7 = 0.8$.\n-   $k=3$: $x_3^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = \\exp(-E_3) + \\exp(-E_1) + \\exp(-E_2) = \\exp(-2) + 1 + \\exp(-1)$, and $y_3^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = p_3 + p_1 + p_2 = 1.0$.\n\nNow we can compute $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}})$ and the violation magnitude $D$.\nThe violation at checkpoint $k$ is $[y_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}} - C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_k^{\\boldsymbol{q}})]_+$.\n\n-   **Checkpoint $k=1$**:\n$x_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = \\exp(-2)$. This abscissa coincides with the first breakpoint of $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x)$, i.e., $x_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}}$.\nTherefore, $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}}) = y_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = 0.1$.\nThe violation is $[y_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}} - C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_1^{\\boldsymbol{q}})]_+ = [0.15 - 0.1]_+ = [0.05]_+ = 0.05$.\n\n-   **Checkpoint $k=2$**:\n$x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}} = \\exp(-2) + \\exp(-1)$. To find $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}})$, we locate $x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}}$ relative to the breakpoints of $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x)$.\n$x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = \\exp(-2)$ and $x_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}} = 1 + \\exp(-2)$. Since $\\exp(-1)  1$, we have $x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}}  x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}}  x_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}}$.\nThe value $C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}})$ is found by linear interpolation on the segment between $(x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}}, y_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}})$ and $(x_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}}, y_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}})$. The slope of this segment is:\n$$ m = \\frac{y_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}} - y_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}}}{x_2^{\\boldsymbol{p}} - x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}}} = \\frac{0.8 - 0.1}{(1 + \\exp(-2)) - \\exp(-2)} = \\frac{0.7}{1} = 0.7 $$\nThe value of the curve is:\n\\begin{align*} C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}}) = y_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}} + m \\cdot (x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}} - x_1^{\\boldsymbol{p}}) \\\\ = 0.1 + 0.7 \\cdot ((\\exp(-2) + \\exp(-1)) - \\exp(-2)) \\\\ = 0.1 + 0.7 \\exp(-1) \\end{align*}\nThe violation at this point is $[y_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}} - C_{\\boldsymbol{p}}(x_2^{\\boldsymbol{q}})]_+ = [0.4 - (0.1 + 0.7 \\exp(-1))]_+ = [0.3 - 0.7 \\exp(-1)]_+$.\nTo determine if the value is positive, we compare $0.3$ and $0.7 \\exp(-1)$.\n$0.3 = \\frac{3}{10}$ and $0.7 \\exp(-1) = \\frac{7}{10\\exp(1)}$.\nSince $\\exp(1)  3$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\exp(1)} > \\frac{1}{3}$.\nSo, $\\frac{7}{10\\exp(1)} > \\frac{7}{30} \\approx 0.233$. We compare $0.3$ with $0.7/e \\approx 0.7 \\times 0.3678 = 0.25746$.\nSince $0.3 > 0.25746$, the value $0.3 - 0.7 \\exp(-1)$ is positive. The violation is $0.3 - 0.7 \\exp(-1)$.\n\nFinally, we find $D$ by taking the maximum of the two violations:\n$$ D = \\max(0.05, 0.3 - 0.7 \\exp(-1)) $$\nWe must compare $0.05 = \\frac{1}{20}$ and $0.3 - 0.7 \\exp(-1)$.\n$0.3 - 0.7 \\exp(-1) \\approx 0.3 - 0.25746 = 0.04254$.\nThus, $0.05$ is larger.\nLet's check this rigorously. We want to compare $0.05$ and $0.3 - 0.7 e^{-1}$. This is equivalent to comparing $0.7 e^{-1}$ and $0.25$. Or $7 e^{-1}$ and $2.5$. Or $7/e$ and $5/2$. This is equivalent to comparing $14$ and $5e$. Since $e \\approx 2.718$, $5e \\approx 13.59$. So $14 > 5e$. This implies $7/e > 5/2$ is false. It means $7e^{-1}  2.5$. So $0.7e^{-1}  0.25$.\nThen $0.3 - 0.7e^{-1} > 0.3 - 0.25 = 0.05$.\nWait, my calculation is wrong.\nLet's re-do the comparison.\nCompare $0.05$ and $0.3 - 0.7e^{-1}$.\nThis is the same as comparing $0.7e^{-1}$ and $0.3 - 0.05 = 0.25$.\nCompare $0.7/e$ and $0.25 = 1/4$.\nCompare $2.8$ and $e$.\nSince $e \\approx 2.71828$, we have $2.8 > e$.\nSo $0.7/e  0.25$ is false. It is $0.7/e > 0.25$.\nSo $0.7e^{-1} > 0.25$.\nThis means $0.3 - 0.7e^{-1}  0.3 - 0.25 = 0.05$.\nThe solution's logic was correct, let me re-verify that.\nSolution checks `0.05 - (0.3 - 0.7 exp(-1))`. This is `-0.25 + 0.7 exp(-1)`.\nIt has the same sign as `2.8 - exp(1)`. Wait, no. `-0.25 + 0.7/e = (-0.25e + 0.7)/e`. Sign is same as `0.7 - 0.25e`.\n$0.25e \\approx 0.25 * 2.718 = 0.6795$.\nSo $0.7 - 0.25e$ is positive.\nSo $0.05 - (0.3 - 0.7e^{-1}) > 0$.\nSo $0.05 > 0.3 - 0.7e^{-1}$.\nYes, this is correct. The solution's logic is correct. My mental math was sloppy.\n\nThe largest violation is $D = 0.05$.\nAs a fraction in simplest form, this is $D = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$.",

This practice will guide you through the correct procedure for handling such ties by grouping microstates, ensuring that the resulting Lorenz curve is well-defined and robust, thereby sharpening your ability to apply the resource theory to more complex and realistic quantum systems .",

The system is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis with populations $p_{0,1}=0.12$, $p_{0,2}=0.24$ on the two microstates at energy $E_0$, populations $p_{1,1}=0.08$, $p_{1,2}=0.08$, $p_{1,3}=0.08$ on the three microstates at energy $E_1$, and population $p_{2,1}=0.40$ on the single microstate at energy $E_2$.

Ratio: $\\frac{p_{2,1}}{\\gamma_{2,1}} = \\frac{2/5}{1/15} = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 15 = 6$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe $\\beta$-ordering is according to the non-increasing order of the ratio $p_i/\\gamma_i$: $6 > 0.9 > 0.6 > 0.45$.\nThe three microstates at energy $E_1$ have the same ratio $p_i/\\gamma_i = 0.6$. This is because they are degenerate in energy (hence same $\\gamma_i$) and have been assigned equal populations (same $p_i$). This constitutes a tie in the $\\beta$-ordering. According to the problem definition, these three must be grouped into a single segment.\n\nThe ordered sequence of elements for constructing the Lorenz curve is:\n1. Microstate 6 (at $E_2$).\n2. Microstate 2 (at $E_0$ with $p=0.24$).\n3. The group of 3 microstates at $E_1$.\n4. Microstate 1 (at $E_0$ with $p=0.12$).\n\nNow, we compute the coordinates of the vertices of the Lorenz curve, starting from $V_0 = (0,0)$.\nThe $n$-th vertex $V_n$ is $(\\sum_{k\\le n} \\gamma_{i_k}, \\sum_{k\\le n} p_{i_k})$.\n- $V_0 = (0,0)$.\n- First step (microstate 6): Add $(\\gamma_{2,1}, p_{2,1}) = (1/15, 2/5)$.\n  $V_1 = (0+\\frac{1}{15}, 0+\\frac{2}{5}) = (\\frac{1}{15}, \\frac{2}{5})$.\n- Second step (microstate 2): Add $(\\gamma_{0,2}, p_{0,2}) = (4/15, 6/25)$.\n  $V_2 = (\\frac{1}{15}+\\frac{4}{15}, \\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{6}{25}) = (\\frac{5}{15}, \\frac{10}{25}+\\frac{6}{25}) = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{16}{25})$.\n- Third step (the grouped set from $E_1$): This group contributes a total horizontal length of $\\sum \\gamma = 3 \\times \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5}$ and a total vertical length of $\\sum p = 3 \\times \\frac{2}{25} = \\frac{6}{25}$.\n  $V_3 = (V_{2,x} + \\sum\\gamma, V_{2,y} + \\sum p) = (\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{16}{25}+\\frac{6}{25})$.\n  $V_{3,x} = \\frac{5}{15}+\\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}$.\n  $V_{3,y} = \\frac{22}{25}$.\n  So, the third vertex is $V_3 = (\\frac{11}{15}, \\frac{22}{25})$.\n- Fourth step (microstate 1): Add $(\\gamma_{0,1}, p_{0,1}) = (4/15, 3/25)$.\n  $V_4 = (\\frac{11}{15}+\\frac{4}{15}, \\frac{22}{25}+\\frac{3}{25}) = (\\frac{15}{15}, \\frac{25}{25}) = (1,1)$. This is the final point, as expected.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the third vertex, which corresponds to the point after the first three elements in the ordered list have been included. This is the vertex $V_3$.\nThe computed coordinate is $V_3 = (\\frac{11}{15}, \\frac{22}{25})$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The correct $\\beta$-ordered sequence is: first the microstate at $E_2$, then the $E_0$ microstate with population $0.24$, then a single grouped segment containing all three $E_1$ microstates (each with population $0.08$), and finally the $E_0$ microstate with population $0.12$. The third vertex of the Lorenz curve is at $\\left(11/15,\\,22/25\\right)$.**\nThis option correctly describes the $\\beta$-ordered sequence we derived. The populations mentioned ($0.24$ and $0.12$) correctly identify the respective microstates. It also correctly states that the three $E_1$ microstates are grouped. Furthermore, the coordinate given for the third vertex, $(\\frac{11}{15}, \\frac{22}{25})$, matches our calculation exactly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Degenerate energy levels must always be grouped by energy before $\\beta$-ordering; the Lorenz curve is constructed from energy blocks whose segment slopes equal $e^{\\beta E_l}$, independent of the populations $p_i$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The $\\beta$-ordering is based on the ratio $p_i/\\gamma_i$ for each individual microstate $i$. Grouping by energy level first is only valid if all microstates within that level have the same population (a state of \"internal thermal equilibrium\"). In our problem, the two microstates at energy $E_0=0$ have different populations ($p_{0,1}=0.12$, $p_{0,2}=0.24$), leading to different ratios $p_i/\\gamma_i$ ($0.45$ and $0.9$). Therefore, they are not grouped and appear at different positions in the ordering. The slope of a segment is $p_i/\\gamma_i = Z p_i e^{\\beta E_i}$, which clearly depends on the population $p_i$ and is not simply $e^{\\beta E_l}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. When multiple microstates share the same energy and have equal populations $p_i$, their ratios $p_i/\\gamma_i$ are equal; grouping these tied indices into one segment with horizontal length $\\sum \\gamma_i$ and vertical length $\\sum p_i$ yields the same Lorenz curve as any internal ordering of the ties and removes ambiguity.**\nThis statement is a correct general principle. If microstates share the same energy $E$, their $\\gamma_i = e^{-\\beta E}/Z$ are equal. If their populations $p_i$ are also equal, then their ratios $p_i/\\gamma_i$ are necessarily equal, resulting in a tie. Let the common values be $p$ and $\\gamma$. If we add N such states sequentially, the vertices are $(x_0, y_0)$, $(x_0+\\gamma, y_0+p)$, $(x_0+2\\gamma, y_0+2p)$, ..., $(x_0+N\\gamma, y_0+Np)$. These points are collinear. Grouping them corresponds to drawing a single segment from $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x_0+N\\gamma, y_0+Np)$. Geometrically, this produces the same line segment. This confirms that grouping is a valid and robust method for handling such ties.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because $\\gamma_i$ are equal within each degenerate energy shell, the Lorenz curve is invariant under any permutation among those microstates, even if their $p_i$ differ; therefore, ties need not be handled by grouping.**\nThis is incorrect. The Lorenz curve's construction depends on the $\\beta$-ordering, which is determined by the ratio $p_i/\\gamma_i$. While $\\gamma_i$ is constant within a degenerate shell, if the populations $p_i$ differ, the ratios $p_i/\\gamma_i$ will also differ. This means the microstates will occupy different positions in the ordering. For example, at energy $E_0=0$, the two microstates have different populations and thus different ratios ($0.9$ and $0.45$), placing them far apart in the sequence. Permuting them would fundamentally alter the shape of the Lorenz curve.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. After $\\beta$-ordering and appropriate grouping, the third vertex of the Lorenz curve is at $\\left(2/3,\\,22/25\\right)$.**\nOur calculation for the third vertex yielded $V_3 = (\\frac{11}{15}, \\frac{22}{25})$. The x-coordinate in this option is $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{15}$. This does not match our derived x-coordinate of $\\frac{11}{15}$. The calculation for the x-coordinate was $V_{3,x} = V_{2,x} + \\sum\\gamma = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{11}{15}$. The option presents an incorrect value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Hamiltonians, Eigenvalues, and Eigenstates**\n\nThe initial Hamiltonian at $t=0$ is $H(0) = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_{z}$. Since $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $H(0)$ is already diagonal in the standard basis.\n$$H(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\omega}{2}  0 \\\\ 0  -\\frac{\\omega}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues are $E_0^{(0)} = \\frac{\\omega}{2}$ and $E_1^{(0)} = -\\frac{\\omega}{2}$. The corresponding eigenstates are the standard basis vectors $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe final Hamiltonian at $t=\\tau$ is $H(\\tau) = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\sigma_z + \\lambda\\sigma_x$.\n$$H(\\tau) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\omega}{2}  \\lambda \\\\ \\lambda  -\\frac{\\omega}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nTo find the eigenvalues $E'$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(H(\\tau) - E'\\mathbb{I}) = 0$:\n$$(\\frac{\\omega}{2}-E')(-\\frac{\\omega}{2}-E') - \\lambda^2 = 0 \\implies E'^2 - \\frac{\\omega^2}{4} - \\lambda^2 = 0$$\n$$E' = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega^2}{4}+\\lambda^2} = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\omega^2+4\\lambda^2}$$\nLet us define $\\Omega = \\sqrt{\\omega^2+4\\lambda^2}$. The eigenvalues of $H(\\tau)$ are $E_0^{(\\tau)} = \\frac{\\Omega}{2}$ and $E_1^{(\\tau)} = -\\frac{\\Omega}{2}$.\n\n###\n**2. Initial State and Partition Functions**\n\nThe system is initially in a Gibbs state with respect to $H(0)$: $\\rho_0 = \\exp(-\\beta H(0))/Z_0$.\nThe initial partition function is:\n$$Z_0 = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H(0))] = \\exp(-\\beta E_0^{(0)}) + \\exp(-\\beta E_1^{(0)}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right) = 2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)$$\nThe probabilities of measuring the initial energies $E_0^{(0)}$ and $E_1^{(0)}$ are:\n$p_0 = \\langle 0|\\rho_0|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_0}\\exp(-\\beta E_0^{(0)}) = \\frac{1}{Z_0}\\exp(-\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2})$\n$p_1 = \\langle 1|\\rho_0|1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_0}\\exp(-\\beta E_1^{(0)}) = \\frac{1}{Z_0}\\exp(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2})$\n\n###\n**3. Exclusive Work**\n\nThe exclusive work $W_{\\mathrm{excl}}$ is defined by a TPM scheme where the energy is measured with respect to $H_0 = H(0)$ at both $t=0$ and $t=\\tau$. The work is the difference in the measured energy eigenvalues.\n1.  At $t=0$, a projective measurement of $H_0$ is performed. The outcome is $E_n^{(0)}$ (with $n \\in \\{0,1\\}$) with probability $p_n$. The system state collapses to the corresponding eigenstate $|n\\rangle$.\n2.  The system evolves under the unitary operator $U(\\tau)$. For a sudden quench, $\\tau \\to 0^{+}$, so $U(\\tau) \\approx \\mathbb{I}$. The state of the system remains $|n\\rangle$.\n3.  At $t=\\tau$, a projective measurement of $H_0$ is performed on the state $|n\\rangle$. The probability of obtaining the outcome $E_m^{(0)}$ is $|\\langle m|U(\\tau)|n\\rangle|^2 \\approx |\\langle m|n\\rangle|^2 = \\delta_{mn}$.\n\nThis means that if the initial measurement yielded $E_n^{(0)}$, the final measurement will also yield $E_n^{(0)}$ with probability $1$. The work done is $W_{\\mathrm{excl}} = E_n^{(0)} - E_n^{(0)} = 0$. This is the only possible outcome. The work distribution is therefore a Dirac delta function centered at zero:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{excl}}(W) = \\delta(W)$$\nThe corresponding fluctuation average is:\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{excl}})\\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dW P_{\\mathrm{excl}}(W) \\exp(-\\beta W) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dW \\delta(W) \\exp(-\\beta W) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\n\n###\n**4. Inclusive Work**\n\nThe inclusive work $W_{\\mathrm{incl}}$ is defined by a TPM scheme where the energy is measured with respect to $H(0)$ at $t=0$ and $H(\\tau)$ at $t=\\tau$.\n1.  The first measurement is the same as for the exclusive case.\n2.  The system state after the initial measurement and evolution is $|n\\rangle$.\n3.  At $t=\\tau$, a projective measurement of $H(\\tau)$ is performed. The possible outcomes are its eigenvalues $E_m^{(\\tau)}$ (with $m \\in \\{0,1\\}$). The probability of obtaining $E_m^{(\\tau)}$ given the initial state $|n\\rangle$ is $|\\langle m'|U(\\tau)|n\\rangle|^2 \\approx |\\langle m'|n\\rangle|^2$, where $|m'\\rangle$ are the eigenstates of $H(\\tau)$.\n\nThe work is $W = E_m^{(\\tau)} - E_n^{(0)}$. The characteristic function of work is given by:\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{incl}})\\rangle = \\sum_{n,m=0,1} p_n |\\langle m'|U(\\tau)|n\\rangle|^2 \\exp(-\\beta(E_m^{(\\tau)} - E_n^{(0)}))$$\nSubstituting $p_n = \\exp(-\\beta E_n^{(0)})/Z_0$ and $U(\\tau) \\approx \\mathbb{I}$:\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{incl}})\\rangle = \\sum_{n,m} \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_n^{(0)})}{Z_0} |\\langle m'|n\\rangle|^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_m^{(\\tau)}) \\exp(\\beta E_n^{(0)})$$\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{incl}})\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_0} \\sum_{n,m} |\\langle m'|n\\rangle|^2 \\exp(-\\beta E_m^{(\\tau)})$$\nWe can sum over $n$ first. Using the completeness of the basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$, $\\sum_n |n\\rangle\\langle n| = \\mathbb{I}$:\n$$\\sum_n |\\langle m'|n\\rangle|^2 = \\sum_n \\langle m'|n\\rangle\\langle n|m'\\rangle = \\langle m'| \\left(\\sum_n |n\\rangle\\langle n|\\right) |m'\\rangle = \\langle m'|\\mathbb{I}|m'\\rangle = 1$$\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{incl}})\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z_0} \\sum_m \\exp(-\\beta E_m^{(\\tau)})$$\nThe sum is the partition function $Z_\\tau$ associated with the final Hamiltonian $H(\\tau)$ at the same inverse temperature $\\beta$:\n$$Z_\\tau = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H(\\tau))] = \\exp(-\\beta E_0^{(\\tau)}) + \\exp(-\\beta E_1^{(\\tau)}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\Omega}{2}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\Omega}{2}\\right) = 2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\Omega}{2}\\right)$$\nThis yields the well-known Jarzynski-type relation for a quantum quench:\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{incl}})\\rangle = \\frac{Z_\\tau}{Z_0} = \\frac{2\\cosh(\\frac{\\beta\\Omega}{2})}{2\\cosh(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2})} = \\frac{\\cosh(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\sqrt{\\omega^2+4\\lambda^2})}{\\cosh(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2})}$$\n\n###\n**5. Final Difference Calculation**\n\nThe required quantity is $\\Delta(\\beta,\\omega,\\lambda) = \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{incl}})\\rangle - \\langle \\exp(-\\beta W_{\\mathrm{excl}})\\rangle$.\nSubstituting the results from the previous sections:\n$$\\Delta(\\beta,\\omega,\\lambda) = \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\sqrt{\\omega^2+4\\lambda^2}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)} - 1$$\nThis expression can be combined into a single fraction:\n$$\\Delta(\\beta,\\omega,\\lambda) = \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\sqrt{\\omega^2+4\\lambda^2}\\right) - \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\omega}{2}\\right)}$$\nThis is the final simplified analytical expression for the difference.",
