This exercise explores the transpose map, a classic example that is positive but not completely positive.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a standard and well-defined problem in quantum information theory concerning the properties of quantum dynamical maps. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and objective.\n\nThe analysis begins with the explicit construction of the operator $X$. The bipartite system is described by the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{A} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{B}$, where $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{A}) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_{B}) = d$, with $d \\geq 2$. We are given the maximally entangled state:\n$$\n|\\Phi_{d}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |i\\rangle_{B}\n$$\nThe corresponding density operator $\\rho_{\\Phi}$ is given by the outer product $|\\Phi_{d}\\rangle\\langle \\Phi_{d}|$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\Phi} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |i\\rangle_{B} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\langle j|_{A} \\otimes \\langle j|_{B} \\right)\n$$\nExpanding this expression yields:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\Phi} = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} (|i\\rangle_{A}\\langle j|_{A}) \\otimes (|i\\rangle_{B}\\langle j|_{B})\n$$\nThe operator $X$ is defined as the result of applying the map $\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\otimes T$ to $\\rho_{\\Phi}$. The map $\\mathbb{I}_{d}$ is the identity map on operators on subsystem $A$, and $T$ is the transpose map on operators on subsystem $B$. The transpose map is defined with respect to the computational basis $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ by its action on matrix units: $T(|k\\rangle\\langle l|) = |l\\rangle\\langle k|$. Applying the map $\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\otimes T$ to $\\rho_{\\Phi}$:\n$$\nX = (\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\otimes T)(\\rho_{\\Phi}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\mathbb{I}_{d}(|i\\rangle_{A}\\langle j|_{A}) \\otimes T(|i\\rangle_{B}\\langle j|_{B})\n$$\nUsing the definitions of the maps, we get:\n$$\nX = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} (|i\\rangle_{A}\\langle j|_{A}) \\otimes (|j\\rangle_{B}\\langle i|_{B})\n$$\nThis is the explicit construction of $X$. To understand its properties, we identify this operator. Let us consider the SWAP operator $S$, which is defined by its action on basis vectors: $S(|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B}) = |l\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |k\\rangle_{B}$. Let's compute the action of our operator $X$ on an arbitrary basis vector $|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B}$:\n$$\nX (|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} (|i\\rangle_{A}\\langle j|_{A}) \\otimes (|j\\rangle_{B}\\langle i|_{B}) \\right) (|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B})\n$$\n$$\nX (|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} (|i\\rangle_{A}\\langle j|_{A}|k\\rangle_{A}) \\otimes (|j\\rangle_{B}\\langle i|_{B}|l\\rangle_{B})\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis, $\\langle j|k\\rangle = \\delta_{jk}$ and $\\langle i|l\\rangle = \\delta_{il}$, we can evaluate the sums:\n$$\nX (|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_{A} \\delta_{jk} \\otimes |j\\rangle_{B} \\delta_{il}\n$$\nThe sum over $j$ collapses due to $\\delta_{jk}$, setting $j=k$. The sum over $i$ collapses due to $\\delta_{il}$, setting $i=l$. This yields:\n$$\nX (|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B}) = \\frac{1}{d} |l\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |k\\rangle_{B} = \\frac{1}{d} S(|k\\rangle_{A} \\otimes |l\\rangle_{B})\n$$\nSince this holds for a complete basis of $\\mathcal{H}_{A} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{B}$, we have established that $X = \\frac{1}{d} S$. The operator $X$ is the SWAP operator scaled by a factor of $\\frac{1}{d}$.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of $X$, we can find the eigenvalues of the SWAP operator $S$. The problem statement guides us to use a basis-independent argument based on the decomposition of the total Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{H}_{A} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{B}$ into symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces. Since $\\mathcal{H}_{A}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{B}$ are isomorphic $d$-dimensional spaces, we can denote them both by $\\mathcal{H}_d$. The tensor product space $\\mathcal{H}_d \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_d$ decomposes into the direct sum of the symmetric subspace, $\\mathcal{S}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, and the antisymmetric subspace, $\\mathcal{A}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_d \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_d = \\mathcal{S}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\oplus \\mathcal{A}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)\n$$\nAny vector $|\\psi_S\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{S}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ is, by definition, symmetric under the exchange of the two subsystems. The SWAP operator $S$ performs this exchange. Therefore, for any $|\\psi_S\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{S}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, we have $S|\\psi_S\\rangle = +1 \\cdot |\\psi_S\\rangle$.\nSimilarly, any vector $|\\psi_A\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{A}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ is, by definition, antisymmetric under the exchange of the two subsystems. Thus, for any $|\\psi_A\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{A}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, we have $S|\\psi_A\\rangle = -1 \\cdot |\\psi_A\\rangle$.\nThis shows that the SWAP operator $S$ has two distinct eigenvalues: $+1$ and $-1$. The entire symmetric subspace is the eigenspace for the eigenvalue $+1$, and the entire antisymmetric subspace is the eigenspace for the eigenvalue $-1$. The dimensions of these subspaces are $\\dim(\\mathcal{S}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)) = \\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$ and $\\dim(\\mathcal{A}^2(\\mathcal{H}_d)) = \\frac{d(d-1)}{2}$. Since $d \\geq 2$, both subspaces are non-empty, and both eigenvalues exist.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $X = \\frac{1}{d} S$ are the eigenvalues of $S$ scaled by $\\frac{1}{d}$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $X$ are $\\frac{+1}{d}$ and $\\frac{-1}{d}$.\n\nThe smallest of these two eigenvalues is $\\frac{-1}{d}$.\n\nNow, we explain why $X$ is not a valid quantum state. A density operator, which represents a quantum state, must be a positive-semidefinite operator, meaning all of its eigenvalues must be non-negative. We found that $X$ has an eigenvalue of $\\frac{-1}{d}$. Since $d \\geq 2$, this eigenvalue is strictly negative. Therefore, $X$ is not a positive-semidefinite operator and cannot represent a valid quantum state.\n\nThis result demonstrates that the transpose map $T$ is not completely positive. A map $\\Lambda$ is completely positive (CP) if the extended map $\\mathbb{I}_{k} \\otimes \\Lambda$ is positive for all $k \\geq 1$. A positive map is one that maps positive-semidefinite operators to positive-semidefinite operators. In our case, we tested the map $\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\otimes T$. We started with a valid density operator $\\rho_{\\Phi}$, which is positive-semidefinite by construction. We found that $(\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\otimes T)(\\rho_{\\Phi}) = X$, and $X$ is not a positive-semidefinite operator. This shows that the map $\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\otimes T$ is not a positive map. By the definition of complete positivity, the failure of $\\mathbb{I}_d \\otimes T$ to be positive implies that $T$ is not a completely positive map.\n\nHowever, the map $T$ itself is positive. To see this, let $\\rho_B$ be any density operator on $\\mathcal{H}_B$. In the computational basis, it is represented by a matrix $[\\rho_B]$. The operator $T(\\rho_B)$ is represented by the transposed matrix $[\\rho_B]^T$. A hermitian matrix and its transpose have the same characteristic polynomial and thus the same eigenvalues. Since $\\rho_B$ is positive-semidefinite, all its eigenvalues are non-negative. Consequently, all eigenvalues of $T(\\rho_B)$ are also non-negative, which means $T(\\rho_B)$ is positive-semidefinite. Thus, $T$ maps positive operators to positive operators, so $T$ is a positive map.\n\nIn summary, the transpose map $T$ is an example of a map that is positive but not completely positive, and the operator $X$ is the vehicle for demonstrating this fact. The smallest eigenvalue of this operator $X$ is $-\\frac{1}{d}$.",

The Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is preserved under this map: $\\langle X, Y \\rangle_{\\mathrm{HS}} = \\langle \\mathrm{vec}(X) | \\mathrm{vec}(Y) \\rangle$.\n\nThe orthonormal operator basis $\\{B_k\\}$ thus corresponds to an orthonormal basis of vectors $\\{|\\mathrm{vec}(B_k)\\rangle\\}$ for the space $\\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}$.\n\nTo derive the conditions on $A=[a_{ij}]$ for $\\Phi$ to be CP, we first find an operator-sum representation (Kraus representation) for $\\Phi$. If the matrix $A$ is positive semidefinite ($A \\ge 0$), it can be decomposed as $A = V V^\\dagger$ for some matrix $V$. The elements of $A$ are $a_{ij} = \\sum_k V_{ik} (V^\\dagger)_{kj} = \\sum_k V_{ik} \\overline{V_{jk}}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\Phi(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^3 \\left( \\sum_k V_{ik} \\overline{V_{jk}} \\right) \\sigma_i \\rho \\sigma_j $$\n$$ \\Phi(\\rho) = \\sum_k \\left( \\sum_i V_{ik} \\sigma_i \\right) \\rho \\left( \\sum_j \\overline{V_{jk}} \\sigma_j \\right) $$\nLet's define the Kraus operators $E_k = \\sum_i V_{ik} \\sigma_i$. Then their adjoints are $E_k^\\dagger = (\\sum_j V_{jk} \\sigma_j)^\\dagger = \\sum_j \\overline{V_{jk}} \\sigma_j^\\dagger = \\sum_j \\overline{V_{jk}} \\sigma_j$.\nThus, the map can be written as $\\Phi(\\rho) = \\sum_k E_k \\rho E_k^\\dagger$. Since any map that can be written in this form is completely positive, the condition $A \\ge 0$ is sufficient for $\\Phi$ to be CP. Conversely, any CP map has a Kraus representation, which implies that its coefficient matrix $A$ must be positive semidefinite. Therefore, the condition $A \\ge 0$ is both necessary and sufficient.\n\n### Matrix Representation of the Choi Matrix\n\nNow we construct the matrix representation of $C_\\Phi$ using this insight. The standard Choi matrix for a map with Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$ is $J(\\Phi) = \\sum_k |\\mathrm{vec}(E_k)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(E_k)|$. The operator defined in the problem is $C_\\Phi = S J(\\Phi) S$, where $S$ is the swap operator on $\\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}$. The swap operator's action on a vectorized operator is $S|\\mathrm{vec}(X)\\rangle = |\\mathrm{vec}(X^T)\\rangle$.\nTherefore,\n$$ C_\\Phi = S \\left( \\sum_k |\\mathrm{vec}(E_k)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(E_k)| \\right) S = \\sum_k |\\mathrm{vec}(E_k^T)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(E_k^T)| $$\nWe need to express $E_k^T$ in the Pauli basis. The transpose of a Pauli operator is $\\sigma_i^T = \\sum_{j=0}^{3} \\Gamma_{ji} \\sigma_j$, where $\\Gamma = \\mathrm{diag}(1, 1, -1, 1)$.\n$$ E_k^T = \\left(\\sum_i V_{ik} \\sigma_i\\right)^T = \\sum_i V_{ik} \\sigma_i^T = \\sum_i V_{ik} \\sum_j \\Gamma_{ji} \\sigma_j = \\sum_j \\left(\\sum_i V_{ik} \\Gamma_{ji}\\right) \\sigma_j = \\sum_j (V\\Gamma^T)_{kj} \\sigma_j $$\nSince $\\Gamma$ is symmetric, $\\Gamma^T = \\Gamma$. Thus $E_k^T = \\sum_j (V\\Gamma)_{kj} \\sigma_j$.\nVectorizing this expression:\n$$ |\\mathrm{vec}(E_k^T)\\rangle = \\sum_j (V\\Gamma)_{kj} |\\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_j)\\rangle $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C_\\Phi$:\n$$ C_\\Phi = \\sum_k \\left( \\sum_j (V\\Gamma)_{kj} |\\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_j)\\rangle \\right) \\left( \\sum_l \\overline{(V\\Gamma)}_{kl} \\langle \\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_l)| \\right) $$\n$$ C_\\Phi = \\sum_{j,l} \\left( \\sum_k (V\\Gamma)_{kj} (\\overline{V\\Gamma})_{kl} \\right) |\\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_j)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_l)| $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the $(j,l)$-th element of the matrix $(V\\Gamma)(V\\Gamma)^\\dagger$:\n$$ (V\\Gamma)(V\\Gamma)^\\dagger = V\\Gamma\\Gamma^\\dagger V^\\dagger = V\\Gamma\\Gamma V^\\dagger $$\nSince $\\Gamma$ is real and diagonal with entries $\\pm 1$, $\\Gamma^\\dagger = \\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma\\Gamma=I$. The expression simplifies to $V V^\\dagger = A$.\nSo, we have a compact representation of the Choi matrix:\n$$ C_\\Phi = \\sum_{j,l=0}^3 a_{jl} |\\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_j)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_l)| $$\nThe problem asks for the matrix representation of $J(\\Phi)$ (which is $C_\\Phi$) in the orthonormal operator basis $\\{B_k\\}$. By the isomorphism between operators and vectors, this is equivalent to finding the matrix of $C_\\Phi$ in the orthonormal basis of vectors $\\{|\\mathrm{vec}(B_k)\\rangle\\}$.\nLet the matrix representation be $M$. Its elements are $M_{ij} = \\langle \\mathrm{vec}(B_i) | C_\\Phi | \\mathrm{vec}(B_j) \\rangle$.\nWe have $|\\mathrm{vec}(\\sigma_k)\\rangle = \\sqrt{2} |\\mathrm{vec}(B_k)\\rangle$.\n$$ C_\\Phi = \\sum_{j,l} a_{jl} (\\sqrt{2}|\\mathrm{vec}(B_j)\\rangle)(\\sqrt{2}\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(B_l)|) = 2 \\sum_{j,l} a_{jl} |\\mathrm{vec}(B_j)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(B_l)| $$\nThe matrix elements are then:\n$$ M_{ij} = \\langle \\mathrm{vec}(B_i) | \\left( 2 \\sum_{k,l} a_{kl} |\\mathrm{vec}(B_k)\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(B_l)| \\right) | \\mathrm{vec}(B_j) \\rangle $$\nUsing the orthonormality $\\langle \\mathrm{vec}(B_i) | \\mathrm{vec}(B_k) \\rangle = \\delta_{ik}$:\n$$ M_{ij} = 2 \\sum_{k,l} a_{kl} \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} = 2 a_{ij} $$\nThus, the matrix representation of $J(\\Phi)$ in the specified orthonormal basis is $2A$.\n\nThe condition for complete positivity is that the Choi matrix must be positive semidefinite. The matrix representation of a positive semidefinite operator in any orthonormal basis must be a positive semidefinite matrix. Therefore, $2A \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $A \\ge 0$, which confirms our earlier derivation.\n\nThe final answer is the compact expression for this matrix representation.",
