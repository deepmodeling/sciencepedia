The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and free of any scientific or factual unsoundness. It is well-posed and asks for a specific derivation based on the provided information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the system, $\\rho_{S}$, are governed by the GKSL master equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho_{S}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H_{S}, \\rho_{S}] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{S})\n$$\nwhere the first term describes the unitary evolution and $\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{S})$ is the dissipator, describing the decoherent effects of the environment. Given the jump operators $L_{+} = \\sigma_{+}$ with rate $\\gamma_{+}$ and $L_{-} = \\sigma_{-}$ with rate $\\gamma_{-}$, the dissipator is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{S}) = \\gamma_{+} \\left( \\sigma_{+} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{+}^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{ \\sigma_{+}^{\\dagger} \\sigma_{+}, \\rho_{S} \\} \\right) + \\gamma_{-} \\left( \\sigma_{-} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{-}^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{ \\sigma_{-}^{\\dagger} \\sigma_{-}, \\rho_{S} \\} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the relations $\\sigma_{+}^{\\dagger} = \\sigma_{-}$ and $\\sigma_{-}^{\\dagger} = \\sigma_{+}$, the dissipator can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{S}) = \\gamma_{+} \\left( \\sigma_{+} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{-} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{ \\sigma_{-} \\sigma_{+}, \\rho_{S} \\} \\right) + \\gamma_{-} \\left( \\sigma_{-} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{+} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{ \\sigma_{+} \\sigma_{-}, \\rho_{S} \\} \\right)\n$$\nThe system Hamiltonian is $H_{S} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} \\sigma_{z}$. Let the eigenstates of $\\sigma_{z}$ be $|e\\rangle$ (excited) and $|g\\rangle$ (ground), such that $\\sigma_z |e\\rangle = +1 |e\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_z |g\\rangle = -1 |g\\rangle$. The corresponding energies are $E_e = +\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}$ and $E_g = -\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}$. The energy gap is $E_e - E_g = \\hbar\\omega$. The operators $\\sigma_{+}$ and $\\sigma_{-}$ act as raising and lowering operators between these states: $\\sigma_{+} = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$ and $\\sigma_{-} = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$. We also have the projector relations: $\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-} = |e\\rangle\\langle e| \\equiv P_e$ and $\\sigma_{-}\\sigma_{+} = |g\\rangle\\langle g| \\equiv P_g$.\n\nWe are interested in the dynamics of the populations of the energy eigenstates. Let $p_e(t) = \\langle e | \\rho_S(t) | e \\rangle$ and $p_g(t) = \\langle g | \\rho_S(t) | g \\rangle$. The time evolution of the excited state population is given by $\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = \\langle e | \\frac{d\\rho_S}{dt} | e \\rangle$.\n\nThe commutator term does not contribute to population dynamics: $\\langle e | [H_S, \\rho_S] | e \\rangle = \\langle e | H_S \\rho_S - \\rho_S H_S | e \\rangle = E_e \\langle e|\\rho_S|e\\rangle - \\langle e|\\rho_S|e\\rangle E_e = 0$.\n\nWe analyze the contribution from the dissipator term by term:\nFor the $\\gamma_{+}$ term:\n$$\n\\langle e | \\gamma_{+} ( \\sigma_{+} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{-} - \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{-} \\sigma_{+} \\rho_{S} + \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{-} \\sigma_{+})) | e \\rangle = \\gamma_{+} \\langle e | \\sigma_{+} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{-} | e \\rangle - \\frac{\\gamma_{+}}{2} \\langle e | P_g \\rho_S + \\rho_S P_g | e \\rangle\n$$\nThe first part is $\\gamma_{+} \\langle e | |e\\rangle\\langle g| \\rho_S |g\\rangle\\langle e| | e \\rangle = \\gamma_{+} \\langle g | \\rho_S | g \\rangle = \\gamma_{+} p_g$. This represents absorption.\nThe second part is zero because $\\langle e|P_g = \\langle e|g\\rangle\\langle g| = 0$ and $P_g|e\\rangle = |g\\rangle\\langle g|e\\rangle = 0$.\nSo the $\\gamma_{+}$ term contributes $+\\gamma_{+} p_g$ to $\\frac{dp_e}{dt}$.\n\nFor the $\\gamma_{-}$ term:\n$$\n\\langle e | \\gamma_{-} ( \\sigma_{-} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{+} - \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{+} \\sigma_{-} \\rho_{S} + \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{+} \\sigma_{-})) | e \\rangle = \\gamma_{-} \\langle e | \\sigma_{-} \\rho_{S} \\sigma_{+} | e \\rangle - \\frac{\\gamma_{-}}{2} \\langle e | P_e \\rho_S + \\rho_S P_e | e \\rangle\n$$\nThe first part is zero because $\\sigma_{+}|e\\rangle = |e\\rangle\\langle g|e\\rangle = 0$.\nThe second part is $-\\frac{\\gamma_{-}}{2} ( \\langle e |P_e \\rho_S| e \\rangle + \\langle e |\\rho_S P_e| e \\rangle ) = -\\frac{\\gamma_{-}}{2} ( \\langle e |e\\rangle\\langle e| \\rho_S | e \\rangle + \\langle e | \\rho_S | e \\rangle\\langle e| e \\rangle ) = -\\frac{\\gamma_{-}}{2} (p_e + p_e) = -\\gamma_{-} p_e$. This represents emission.\nSo the $\\gamma_{-}$ term contributes $-\\gamma_{-} p_e$ to $\\frac{dp_e}{dt}$.\n\nCombining these results, the rate equation for the excited state population is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = \\gamma_{+} p_g - \\gamma_{-} p_e\n$$\nDue to conservation of probability, $p_e + p_g = 1$, we have $\\frac{dp_g}{dt} = -\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = \\gamma_{-} p_e - \\gamma_{+} p_g$.\n\nThe unique stationary state is found by setting the time derivatives to zero, $\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = 0$. Let the stationary populations be $p_e^{ss}$ and $p_g^{ss}$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{+} p_g^{ss} - \\gamma_{-} p_e^{ss} = 0 \\implies \\frac{p_e^{ss}}{p_g^{ss}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{+}}{\\gamma_{-}}\n$$\nThe problem requires that this stationary state is the thermal Gibbs state $\\rho_{\\beta}$ at inverse temperature $\\beta$. The Gibbs state is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta H_{S})}{Z} = \\frac{1}{Z} \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-\\beta E_e) & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\exp(-\\beta E_g) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H_{S})] = \\exp(-\\beta E_e) + \\exp(-\\beta E_g)$ is the partition function.\nThe populations in the thermal state are $p_e^{th} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_e)}{Z}$ and $p_g^{th} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_g)}{Z}$.\n\nFor the stationary state to be the thermal state, we must have $p_e^{ss} = p_e^{th}$ and $p_g^{ss} = p_g^{th}$. Therefore, the ratio of the stationary populations must equal the ratio of the thermal populations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma_{+}}{\\gamma_{-}} = \\frac{p_e^{ss}}{p_g^{ss}} = \\frac{p_e^{th}}{p_g^{th}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_e)/Z}{\\exp(-\\beta E_g)/Z} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_e)}{\\exp(-\\beta E_g)}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma_{+}}{\\gamma_{-}} = \\exp(-\\beta (E_e - E_g))\n$$\nSubstituting the energy values $E_e = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}$ and $E_g = -\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}$, the energy difference is $E_e - E_g = \\hbar\\omega$.\nThis yields the final relation, known as the detailed balance condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma_{+}}{\\gamma_{-}} = \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega)\n$$\nThis relationship ensures that the dynamics generated by the GKSL master equation drive the system to the correct thermal equilibrium state.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it represents a standard, well-posed problem in the theory of open quantum systems, specifically the derivation of the Lindblad master equation for a spin-boson model. All provided information is scientifically grounded, self-consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe system in question is a two-level quantum system (a qubit) whose free dynamics are governed by the Hamiltonian $H=\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}\\sigma_{z}$. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are the excited state $|e\\rangle$ and the ground state $|g\\rangle$, corresponding to the eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$ of the Pauli operator $\\sigma_z$, respectively. The energy eigenvalues are thus $E_e = +\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}$ and $E_g = -\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}$. The energy difference between these levels defines the system's characteristic Bohr frequency, $\\Delta E = E_e - E_g = \\omega_0$.

The system part of this interaction is $\\sigma_x$. To analyze the dissipative dynamics under the secular approximation, we must decompose the system operator $\\sigma_x$ into the eigenoperators of the free Hamiltonian's adjoint action, i.e., operators $A$ satisfying $[H, A] = -\\omega A$ for some Bohr frequency $\\omega$. The operator $\\sigma_x$ can be written in terms of the ladder operators $\\sigma_+ = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$ and $\\sigma_- = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$ as $\\sigma_x = \\sigma_+ + \\sigma_-$.\nLet's find the Bohr frequencies associated with these ladder operators.\nFor $\\sigma_-$, we have:\n$$[H, \\sigma_-] = \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\sigma_z, |g\\rangle\\langle e|\\right] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2} (\\sigma_z |g\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle e| \\sigma_z) = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(-1 \\cdot |g\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle e| \\cdot 1) = -\\omega_0 |g\\rangle\\langle e| = -\\omega_0 \\sigma_-$$\nThis means $\\sigma_-$ is an eigenoperator with Bohr frequency $\\omega = \\omega_0$. This operator induces a downward transition from $|e\\rangle$ to $|g\\rangle$, corresponding to the system losing energy $\\omega_0$.\n\nFor $\\sigma_+$, we have:\n$$[H, \\sigma_+] = \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}\\sigma_z, |e\\rangle\\langle g|\\right] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2} (\\sigma_z |e\\rangle\\langle g| - |e\\rangle\\langle g| \\sigma_z) = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(1 \\cdot |e\\rangle\\langle g| - |e\\rangle\\langle g| \\cdot (-1)) = \\omega_0 |e\\rangle\\langle g| = \\omega_0 \\sigma_+$$\nThis means $\\sigma_+$ is an eigenoperator with Bohr frequency $\\omega = -\\omega_0$. This operator induces an upward transition from $|g\\rangle$ to $|e\\rangle$, corresponding to the system gaining energy $\\omega_0$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system's reduced density matrix $\\rho_S$, under the Born, Markov, and secular approximations, is described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. For this system, it takes the form:\n$$\\frac{d\\rho_S}{dt} = -i[H, \\rho_S] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_S)$$\nThe dissipative part, or Lindbladian $\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_S)$, is a sum over the contributions from each jump process:\n$$\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_S) = G(\\omega_0) \\left( \\sigma_- \\rho_S \\sigma_+ - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_+ \\sigma_-, \\rho_S\\} \\right) + G(-\\omega_0) \\left( \\sigma_+ \\rho_S \\sigma_- - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_- \\sigma_+, \\rho_S\\} \\right)$$\nHere, the operators $\\sigma_-$ and $\\sigma_+$ are the jump operators. The rate $G(\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the downward transition (decay rate), and $G(-\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the upward transition (excitation rate). These rates are determined by the Fourier transform of the bath correlation function, evaluated at the corresponding Bohr frequency:\n$$G(\\omega) = \\lambda^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{i\\omega\\tau} \\langle B(\\tau) B(0) \\rangle_{\\beta}$$\nwhere $B(\\tau) = e^{iH_B \\tau} B e^{-iH_B \\tau}$ is the bath operator in the interaction picture with respect to the bath Hamiltonian $H_B$, and the expectation value $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{\\beta}$ is taken over the thermal Gibbs state of the bath $\\rho_B = \\exp(-\\beta H_B) / \\mathrm{Tr}[\\exp(-\\beta H_B)]$.\n\nThe problem states that the environment is a bosonic bath characterized by a spectral density $J(\\omega)$ and the Bose-Einstein distribution $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega)=\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega)-1}$. The spectral density $J(\\omega)$ is conventionally defined for $\\omega > 0$ and encapsulates the coupling strength $\\lambda^2$ and the density of bath modes at frequency $\\omega$. The rates $G(\\omega_0)$ and $G(-\\omega_0)$ can be expressed in terms of $J(\\omega_0)$ and $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$ through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n\nThe downward rate $G(\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the system losing energy $\\omega_0$ to the bath (emission). This process can be spontaneous or stimulated by the thermal excitations already present in the bath. The rate is therefore proportional to $J(\\omega_0)$ and the factor $(n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0) + 1)$:\n$$G(\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) (n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0) + 1)$$\n\nThe upward rate $G(-\\omega_0)$ corresponds to the system gaining energy $\\omega_0$ from the bath (absorption). This process can only occur if the bath has thermal excitations to provide the energy. The rate is therefore proportional to $J(\\omega_0)$ and the number of thermal bosons $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$:\n$$G(-\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$$\n\nNow we express these rates solely in terms of $J(\\omega_0)$ and $\\beta$ by substituting the definition of $n_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\omega_0)$:\n$$G(\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} + 1 \\right) = J(\\omega_0) \\left( \\frac{1 + \\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} \\right) = J(\\omega_0) \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0)}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}$$\n$$G(-\\omega_0) = J(\\omega_0) \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}$$\nThese are the final expressions for the transition rates.\n\nFinally, we must verify the quantum detailed balance condition, $G(-\\omega_{0})=\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_{0})\\,G(\\omega_{0})$. This condition ensures that, in the absence of external driving, the system will eventually thermalize to the Gibbs state at the same temperature as the bath. Let's substitute our derived expressions into the right-hand side of the condition:\n$$\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_0) G(\\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\beta \\omega_0) \\left( J(\\omega_0) \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0)}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} \\right)$$\n$$= J(\\omega_0) \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_0) \\exp(\\beta \\omega_0)}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1} = J(\\omega_0) \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\omega_0) - 1}$$\nThis result is precisely our expression for $G(-\\omega_0)$. Thus, the condition $G(-\\omega_{0})=\\exp(-\\beta \\omega_{0})\\,G(\\omega_{0})$ is verified.\n\nThe final answer requires the closed-form expressions for $G(\\omega_0)$ and $G(-\\omega_0)$.\n$G(\\omega_0)$ is the downward (emission) transition rate.\n$G(-\\omega_0)$ is the upward (absorption) transition rate.",

The associated rates are denoted $\\gamma_{\\downarrow}$ and $\\gamma_{\\uparrow}$, respectively.\n\nThe GKSL dissipator is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_D(\\rho) = \\gamma_{\\downarrow} \\left( \\sigma_- \\rho \\sigma_+ - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_+ \\sigma_-, \\rho\\} \\right) + \\gamma_{\\uparrow} \\left( \\sigma_+ \\rho \\sigma_- - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_- \\sigma_+, \\rho\\} \\right)\n$$\nStandard microscopic derivation shows that the rates are proportional to the Fourier transform of the bath correlation function, $\\tilde{C}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}t \\, \\exp(i\\omega t) C(t)$, evaluated at the relevant transition frequency.\nThe relaxation process $|1\\rangle \\to |0\\rangle$ involves the system releasing energy $\\hbar \\omega_0$ to the bath. The corresponding rate is proportional to the bath's ability to absorb this energy, which is given by the spectral density at positive frequency $\\omega_0$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\downarrow} \\propto \\tilde{C}(\\omega_0)\n$$\nThe excitation process $|0\\rangle \\to |1\\rangle$ requires the system to absorb energy $\\hbar \\omega_0$ from the bath. The rate is proportional to the bath's ability to provide this energy, given by the spectral density at negative frequency $-\\omega_0$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow} \\propto \\tilde{C}(-\\omega_0)\n$$\nThe prefactors relating rates to the spectral density are identical for both processes. The bath is in a thermal state, so its correlation function must satisfy the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, which relates the correlation function at positive and negative frequencies:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}(-\\omega) = \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega) \\tilde{C}(\\omega)\n$$\nThe ratio of the excitation rate to the relaxation rate can now be computed. Using the KMS condition with $\\omega = \\omega_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma_{\\uparrow}}{\\gamma_{\\downarrow}} = \\frac{\\tilde{C}(-\\omega_0)}{\\tilde{C}(\\omega_0)} = \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0)\n$$\nThis is the detailed balance condition, which ensures that in the absence of external driving, the system equilibrates to the correct thermal Gibbs state with respect to its Hamiltonian $H_S$.\n\nTask 2: Onsager reciprocity in linear response\n\nNext, we analyze the system coupled to two independent reservoirs, labeled $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, near equilibrium. The population dynamics of the excited state, $p_1(t)$, follows a classical master equation. The total rate of change of $p_1$ is the sum of inflows minus the sum of outflows:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_1}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)} + \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)}) p_0 - (\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(2)}) p_1\n$$\nUsing the conservation of probability, $p_0(t) = 1 - p_1(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_1}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)} + \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)}) - \\left( \\sum_{i=1,2} \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)} \\right) p_1\n$$\nIn the steady state ($\\mathrm{d}p_1/\\mathrm{d}t = 0$), the excited state population $p_1^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is:\n$$\np_1^{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)}}{\\sum_{i} (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)})}\n$$\nAnd the ground state population $p_0^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is:\n$$\np_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} = 1 - p_1^{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)}}{\\sum_{i} (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)})}\n$$\nThe steady-state flux out of reservoir $i$ is defined as $J_i = \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)} p_0^{\\mathrm{ss}} - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)} p_1^{\\mathrm{ss}}$. Substituting the expressions for $p_0^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $p_1^{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nJ_i = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)} \\sum_{j} \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(j)} - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)} \\sum_{j} \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(j)}}{\\sum_{j} (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(j)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(j)})}\n$$\nFor $i=1$, the numerator is $\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)}(\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(2)}) - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)}(\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)} + \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)}) = \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)}\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(2)} - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)}\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)}$.\nThus, we have:\n$$\nJ_1 = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)}\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(2)} - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)}\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)}}{\\sum_{j=1,2} (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(j)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(j)})}\n$$\nBy symmetry, $J_2 = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)}\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)} - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(2)}\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)}}{\\sum_{j=1,2} (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(j)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(j)})} = -J_1$, which reflects the conservation of probability flux in the steady state.\n\nWe now linearize these expressions in the small affinities $|X_i| \\ll 1$. The given parametrization is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(i)} = r_{i} \\exp(-X_i/2) \\approx r_i(1 - X_i/2)\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(i)} = r_{i} \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0) \\exp(X_i/2) \\approx r_i \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0)(1 + X_i/2)\n$$\nLet's denote $e_0 = \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0)$. The numerator of $J_1$ is linearized as:\n$$\nN_1 = \\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(1)}\\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(2)} - \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(1)}\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(2)} \\approx [r_1 e_0 (1+X_1/2)] [r_2 (1-X_2/2)] - [r_1 (1-X_1/2)] [r_2 e_0 (1+X_2/2)]\n$$\n$$\nN_1 = r_1 r_2 e_0 \\left[ (1 + \\frac{X_1}{2} - \\frac{X_2}{2}) - (1 - \\frac{X_1}{2} + \\frac{X_2}{2}) \\right] + \\mathcal{O}(X^2) = r_1 r_2 e_0 (X_1 - X_2)\n$$\nThe numerator is of first order in $X_i$. For the overall flux to be linear, we need only the zeroth-order term of the denominator $D = \\sum_{j} (\\gamma_{\\uparrow}^{(j)} + \\gamma_{\\downarrow}^{(j)})$.\n$$\nD_0 = D|_{X_1=X_2=0} = \\sum_{j=1,2} (r_j e_0 + r_j) = (r_1 + r_2)(1 + e_0)\n$$\nThus, to linear order in affinities, the flux is:\n$$\nJ_1 \\approx \\frac{r_1 r_2 e_0 (X_1 - X_2)}{(r_1 + r_2)(1+e_0)} = \\frac{r_1 r_2 \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0)}{(r_1+r_2)(1+\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0))} (X_1 - X_2)\n$$\nWe also have $J_2 = -J_1$. The linear response matrix $L_{ij}$ is defined by the relation $J_i = \\sum_{j} L_{ij} X_j$. By expanding the expressions for $J_1$ and $J_2$:\n$$\nJ_1 = \\left(\\frac{r_1 r_2 e_0}{(r_1+r_2)(1+e_0)}\\right) X_1 - \\left(\\frac{r_1 r_2 e_0}{(r_1+r_2)(1+e_0)}\\right) X_2\n$$\n$$\nJ_2 = -\\left(\\frac{r_1 r_2 e_0}{(r_1+r_2)(1+e_0)}\\right) X_1 + \\left(\\frac{r_1 r_2 e_0}{(r_1+r_2)(1+e_0)}\\right) X_2\n$$\nBy comparing coefficients, we identify the off-diagonal elements of the response matrix:\n$$\nL_{12} = -\\frac{r_1 r_2 \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0)}{(r_1+r_2)(1+\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0))}\n$$\n$$\nL_{21} = -\\frac{r_1 r_2 \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0)}{(r_1+r_2)(1+\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_0))}\n$$\nWe observe that $L_{12} = L_{21}$, which is a manifestation of the Onsager reciprocity relations for this system. The quantity to be computed is their difference:\n$$\nL_{12} - L_{21} = 0\n$$\nThis result is robust and independent of the specific symmetric parametrization of the rates, as long as it is consistent with the perturbed detailed balance condition.",
