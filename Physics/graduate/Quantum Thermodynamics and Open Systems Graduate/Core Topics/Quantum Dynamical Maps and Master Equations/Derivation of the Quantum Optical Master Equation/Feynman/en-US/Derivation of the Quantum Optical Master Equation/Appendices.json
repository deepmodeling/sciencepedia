A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe dynamics of the density matrix $\\rho$ for the two-level system are described by the Lindblad master equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}[H(t), \\rho] + \\mathcal{L}[\\rho]\n$$\nThe basis states are the excited state $\\lvert e \\rangle$ and ground state $\\lvert g \\rangle$. We can represent them as $\\lvert e \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\lvert g \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The Pauli operators are $\\sigma_z = \\lvert e \\rangle \\langle e \\rvert - \\lvert g \\rangle \\langle g \\rvert$, $\\sigma_x = \\lvert e \\rangle \\langle g \\rvert + \\lvert g \\rangle \\langle e \\rvert$, $\\sigma_+ = \\lvert e \\rangle \\langle g \\rvert$, and $\\sigma_- = \\lvert g \\rangle \\langle e \\rvert$.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian in the Schrödinger picture (lab frame) is $H(t) = H_0 + H_I(t)$. The free Hamiltonian is $H_0 = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} \\sigma_z$, setting the energy origin midway between the levels. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_I(t) = -\\mu E_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\sigma_x = -\\hbar \\Omega \\cos(\\omega t) \\sigma_x$.\n\nThe Lindblad superoperator $\\mathcal{L}[\\rho]$ accounts for the incoherent processes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[\\rho] = \\Gamma_1 \\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_-]\\rho + R \\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_+]\\rho + \\frac{\\gamma^*}{2}\\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_z]\\rho\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}[A]\\rho = A\\rho A^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\{A^\\dagger A, \\rho\\}$. The first term is spontaneous emission, the second is incoherent pumping, and the third is pure dephasing.\n\nTo simplify the equations, we transform to a frame rotating at the drive frequency $\\omega$. The density matrix in the rotating frame is $\\tilde{\\rho} = U^\\dagger \\rho U$, with the unitary operator $U(t) = \\exp(-i \\omega t \\sigma_z / 2)$. The master equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{\\rho}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}[H_R, \\tilde{\\rho}] + \\mathcal{L}[\\tilde{\\rho}]\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian in the rotating frame is $H_R = U^\\dagger H(t) U + i\\hbar(\\dot{U}^\\dagger)U$.\n$$\nH_R = \\frac{\\hbar(\\omega_0 - \\omega)}{2}\\sigma_z - \\hbar\\Omega \\cos(\\omega t) (\\sigma_x \\cos(\\omega t) + \\sigma_y \\sin(\\omega t))\n$$\nApplying the RWA consists of time-averaging over one optical cycle, which eliminates the terms oscillating at $2\\omega$. With the resonance condition $\\omega = \\omega_0$, the detuning is $\\Delta = \\omega_0 - \\omega = 0$. The Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$$\nH_{RWA} = -\\frac{\\hbar \\Omega}{2}\\sigma_x\n$$\nThe master equation in the rotating frame is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i\\Omega}{2}[\\sigma_x, \\tilde{\\rho}] + \\Gamma_1 \\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_-]\\tilde{\\rho} + R \\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_+]\\tilde{\\rho} + \\frac{\\gamma^*}{2}\\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_z]\\tilde{\\rho}\n$$\nWe derive the equations of motion for the elements of $\\tilde{\\rho} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{ee} & \\rho_{eg} \\\\ \\rho_{ge} & \\rho_{gg} \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that in the rotating frame these elements are expected to be slowly varying. Using $\\rho_{gg} = 1 - \\rho_{ee}$ and $\\rho_{ge} = \\rho_{eg}^*$:\n\n1.  For the excited state population $\\rho_{ee} = \\langle e \\rvert \\tilde{\\rho} \\lvert e \\rangle$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\rho}_{ee} = \\Omega \\mathrm{Im}(\\rho_{eg}) - (\\Gamma_1+R)\\rho_{ee} + R\n    $$\n2.  For the coherence $\\rho_{ge} = \\langle g \\rvert \\tilde{\\rho} \\lvert e \\rangle$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{\\rho}_{ge} = -\\frac{i\\Omega}{2}(\\rho_{gg} - \\rho_{ee}) - \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_1}{2} + \\frac{R}{2} + \\gamma^*\\right)\\rho_{ge} = -i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}(1 - 2\\rho_{ee}) - \\Gamma_2 \\rho_{ge}\n    $$\n    Here we used the given definition $\\Gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Gamma_1 + R) + \\gamma^*$.\n\nTo find the steady state, we set the time derivatives to zero, $\\dot{\\rho}_{ee} = 0$ and $\\dot{\\rho}_{ge} = 0$. Let the steady-state values be denoted by the superscript $(\\infty)$.\nFrom the second equation, we solve for the steady-state coherence $\\rho_{ge}^{(\\infty)}$:\n$$\n0 = -i\\frac{\\Omega}{2}(1 - 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)}) - \\Gamma_2 \\rho_{ge}^{(\\infty)} \\implies \\rho_{ge}^{(\\infty)} = -i\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\Gamma_2}(1 - 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)})\n$$\nThe requested coherence $\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)}$ is the complex conjugate:\n$$\n\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)} = (\\rho_{ge}^{(\\infty)})^* = i\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\Gamma_2}(1 - 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)})\n$$\nThis shows that the real part of $\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)}$ is zero, and its imaginary part is $\\mathrm{Im}(\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)}) = \\frac{\\Omega}{2\\Gamma_2}(1 - 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)})$.\n\nNow, we use the steady-state condition for the first equation, $\\dot{\\rho}_{ee} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = \\Omega \\mathrm{Im}(\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)}) - (\\Gamma_1+R)\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} + R\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $\\mathrm{Im}(\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)})$:\n$$\n0 = \\Omega \\left( \\frac{\\Omega}{2\\Gamma_2}(1 - 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)}) \\right) - (\\Gamma_1+R)\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} + R\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{2\\Gamma_2} - \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Gamma_2}\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} - (\\Gamma_1+R)\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} + R\n$$\nWe solve for $\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} \\left( \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Gamma_2} + \\Gamma_1+R \\right) = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{2\\Gamma_2} + R\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\Gamma_2$ gives the first required expression:\n$$\n\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 + R \\Gamma_2}{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1 + R)\\Gamma_2}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)}$. First, we find the population difference $w^{(\\infty)} = \\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} - \\rho_{gg}^{(\\infty)} = 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} - 1$:\n$$\n1 - 2\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} = 1 - 2\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 + R\\Gamma_2}{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1+R)\\Gamma_2} = \\frac{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1+R)\\Gamma_2 - \\Omega^2 - 2R\\Gamma_2}{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1+R)\\Gamma_2} = \\frac{(\\Gamma_1-R)\\Gamma_2}{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1+R)\\Gamma_2}\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{eg}^{(\\infty)} = i\\frac{\\Omega}{2\\Gamma_2} \\left( \\frac{(\\Gamma_1-R)\\Gamma_2}{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1+R)\\Gamma_2} \\right) = i \\frac{\\Omega(\\Gamma_1-R)}{2(\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1 + R)\\Gamma_2)}\n$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\nFinally, we determine the condition for population inversion, which is $\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} > \\rho_{gg}^{(\\infty)}$, or $\\rho_{ee}^{(\\infty)} > \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 + R \\Gamma_2}{\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1 + R)\\Gamma_2} > \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSince the denominator is a sum of non-negative rates and a squared frequency, it is strictly positive. We can multiply both sides by $2(\\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1 + R)\\Gamma_2)$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega^2 + R \\Gamma_2\\right) > \\Omega^2 + (\\Gamma_1 + R)\\Gamma_2\n$$\n$$\n\\Omega^2 + 2R\\Gamma_2 > \\Omega^2 + \\Gamma_1\\Gamma_2 + R\\Gamma_2\n$$\n$$\nR\\Gamma_2 > \\Gamma_1\\Gamma_2\n$$\nSince $\\Gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Gamma_1+R)+\\gamma^* > 0$, we can divide by $\\Gamma_2$:\n$$\nR > \\Gamma_1\n$$\nThis inequality shows that population inversion is only possible if the incoherent pumping rate $R$ exceeds the spontaneous emission rate $\\Gamma_1$. The condition is independent of the driving field Rabi frequency $\\Omega$ and the pure dephasing rate $\\gamma^*$. The minimal pump rate $R_{\\mathrm{inv}}$ above which inversion occurs is the boundary of this condition. Thus, the third required expression is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\Gamma_1\n$$\nThe final results are collected as a row matrix.",

Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Master Equation Coefficients\n\nThe general form of the interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{\\mathrm{I}} = A \\otimes B$. To derive the master equation, we decompose the system operator $A$ into its eigenoperators with respect to the system Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{S}}$. An eigenoperator $A(\\omega)$ satisfies the relation $[H_{\\mathrm{S}}, A(\\omega)] = -\\omega A(\\omega)$.\n\nThe system Hamiltonian is $H_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}\\sigma_{z}$. Its eigenstates are the excited state $|e\\rangle$ and ground state $|g\\rangle$ with energies $+\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{2}$ respectively. The transition frequency is $\\omega_0$. The system operator is $A = \\sigma_{x} = \\sigma_{+} + \\sigma_{-}$, where $\\sigma_{+} = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$ and $\\sigma_{-} = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$ are the Pauli raising and lowering operators.\n\nWe test if $\\sigma_{-}$ and $\\sigma_{+}$ are eigenoperators:\n$[H_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\sigma_{-}] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}[\\sigma_z, \\sigma_-] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(-2\\sigma_-) = -\\omega_0 \\sigma_-$.\nThus, $\\sigma_{-}$ is an eigenoperator $A(\\omega_0)$ with frequency $\\omega = \\omega_0$.\n$[H_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\sigma_{+}] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}[\\sigma_z, \\sigma_+] = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(+2\\sigma_+) = \\omega_0 \\sigma_+$.\nThis implies $[H_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\sigma_{+}] = -(-\\omega_0) \\sigma_{+}$. Thus, $\\sigma_{+}$ is an eigenoperator $A(-\\omega_0)$ with frequency $\\omega = -\\omega_0$.\n\nThe operator decomposition is $A = \\sigma_x = A(\\omega_0) + A(-\\omega_0)$.\n\nWithin the Born-Markov approximation, the dynamics are described by a Lindblad master equation:\n$\\dot{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{S}} = -i[H_{\\mathrm{S}} + H_{\\mathrm{LS}}, \\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}] + \\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{S}})$\nThe Lamb shift Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{LS}}$ and the dissipator $\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{S}})$ are constructed from the eigenoperators and coefficients derived from the bath correlation function $C(t) = \\langle B(t)B(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{B}}$. At zero temperature ($T=0$), the bath is in the vacuum state, and the correlation function is:\n$C(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}\\omega\\,J(\\omega)\\exp(-i\\omega t)$\n\nThe rates in the master equation are determined by the one-sided Fourier transform of the correlation function, $\\gamma(\\omega)$:\n$\\gamma(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}t\\,\\exp(i\\omega t)C(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}\\omega'\\,J(\\omega') \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}t\\,\\exp(i(\\omega-\\omega')t) = 2\\pi\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}\\omega'\\,J(\\omega')\\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$.\nThis yields $\\gamma(\\omega) = 2\\pi J(\\omega)$ for $\\omega > 0$ and $\\gamma(\\omega) = 0$ for $\\omega \\le 0$.\n\nThe Lamb shift kernel $S(\\omega)$ is related to $\\gamma(\\omega)$ via the Kramers-Kronig relations:\n$S(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\text{P.V.}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}\\nu\\,\\frac{\\gamma(\\nu)}{\\omega - \\nu} = \\text{P.V.}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\mathrm{d}\\nu\\,\\frac{J(\\nu)}{\\omega - \\nu}$, where P.V. denotes the Cauchy Principal Value.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Spontaneous Emission Rate $\\Gamma$\n\nThe dissipator is given by $\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\{\\omega_0, -\\omega_0\\}} \\gamma(\\omega) \\left( A(\\omega)\\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}A^{\\dagger}(\\omega) - \\frac{1}{2}\\{A^{\\dagger}(\\omega)A(\\omega), \\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}\\} \\right)$.\nThe sum has two terms:\n$1$. For $\\omega=\\omega_0$: $A(\\omega_0) = \\sigma_-$. The rate is $\\gamma(\\omega_0)$. This term describes spontaneous emission.\n$2$. For $\\omega=-\\omega_0$: $A(-\\omega_0) = \\sigma_+$. The rate is $\\gamma(-\\omega_0)$. This term describes excitation from the bath.\n\nSince $\\omega_0 > 0$, $\\gamma(-\\omega_0) = 0$ at zero temperature. Thus, the excitation process is forbidden. The dissipator simplifies to:\n$\\mathcal{D}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}) = \\gamma(\\omega_0)\\left( \\sigma_{-}\\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}\\sigma_{+} - \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}, \\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}\\} \\right)$\nThe rate for spontaneous emission $\\Gamma$ is the coefficient of this dissipative channel.\n$\\Gamma = \\gamma(\\omega_0) = 2\\pi J(\\omega_0)$\nSubstituting the given spectral density $J(\\omega) = \\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\exp(-\\omega/\\omega_c)$:\n$\\Gamma = 2\\pi \\eta\\,\\omega_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{\\omega_{c}}\\right)$\n\nIn this model, at $T=0$, the counter-rotating terms (e.g., $\\sigma_{+}b_{\\omega}^{\\dagger}$) do not induce real transitions and therefore do not modify the spontaneous emission rate $\\Gamma$. The rate is determined solely by the resonant interaction at the system's transition frequency $\\omega_0$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of the Lamb Shift $\\Delta$\n\nThe Lamb shift Hamiltonian is given by $H_{\\mathrm{LS}} = \\sum_{\\omega \\in \\{\\omega_0, -\\omega_0\\}} S(\\omega) A^{\\dagger}(\\omega)A(\\omega)$.\n- For $\\omega=\\omega_0$: $S(\\omega_0)A^{\\dagger}(\\omega_0)A(\\omega_0) = S(\\omega_0)\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-} = S(\\omega_0)|e\\rangle\\langle e|$.\n- For $\\omega=-\\omega_0$: $S(-\\omega_0)A^{\\dagger}(-\\omega_0)A(-\\omega_0) = S(-\\omega_0)\\sigma_{-}\\sigma_{+} = S(-\\omega_0)|g\\rangle\\langle g|$.\n\nSo, $H_{\\mathrm{LS}} = S(\\omega_0)|e\\rangle\\langle e| + S(-\\omega_0)|g\\rangle\\langle g|$. This can be expressed using $\\sigma_z = |e\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle g|$ and $I = |e\\rangle\\langle e| + |g\\rangle\\langle g|$:\n$H_{\\mathrm{LS}} = \\frac{1}{2}(S(\\omega_0) + S(-\\omega_0))I + \\frac{1}{2}(S(\\omega_0) - S(-\\omega_0))\\sigma_z$\n\nThe total system Hamiltonian becomes $H'_{\\mathrm{S}} = H_{\\mathrm{S}} + H_{\\mathrm{LS}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\omega_0 + S(\\omega_0) - S(-\\omega_0)\\right)\\sigma_z + \\text{const}\\cdot I$.\nThe renormalized transition frequency is $\\omega'_0 = \\omega_0 + S(\\omega_0) - S(-\\omega_0)$.\nThe total frequency shift, or Lamb shift, is $\\Delta = \\omega'_0 - \\omega_0 = S(\\omega_0) - S(-\\omega_0)$.\n\nThe term $S(\\omega_0)$ is the contribution from the rotating terms, while the term $-S(-\\omega_0)$ is the contribution from the counter-rotating terms.

The goal is to derive, implement, and compare the population dynamics of the excited state under a non-Markovian model with memory and under the Markovian quantum optical master equation.\n\nStarting point and physical setup:\n- The system Hamiltonian is $H_\\mathrm{S} = \\hbar \\omega_0 \\sigma_+ \\sigma_-$, where $\\omega_0$ is the transition angular frequency and $\\sigma_\\pm$ are the raising/lowering operators for the two-level system.\n- The reservoir Hamiltonian is $H_\\mathrm{B} = \\sum_k \\hbar \\omega_k b_k^\\dagger b_k$, where $b_k$ are bosonic annihilation operators.\n- The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_\\mathrm{I} = \\hbar \\sum_k \\left( g_k \\sigma_+ b_k + g_k^* \\sigma_- b_k^\\dagger \\right)$, assumed to satisfy the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA).

            "solution": "The analysis of the provided problem proceeds in two stages. First, we perform the required derivations for the Markovian decay rate and the non-Markovian excited state amplitude. Second, based on these analytical results, we outline the numerical implementation to compute the specified deviation metric for the given test cases.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Markovian Decay Rate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{M}$**\n\nThe Markovian decay rate, $\\gamma_\\mathrm{M}$, is obtained within the Born-Markov approximation. It is directly related to the reservoir's spectral density, $J(\\omega)$, evaluated at the system's transition frequency, $\\omega_0$. This relationship is a manifestation of Fermi's Golden Rule. The rate for population decay is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_\\mathrm{M} = 2\\pi J(\\omega_0)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a Lorentzian spectral density:\n$$\nJ(\\omega) = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda^2}{2\\pi \\left[(\\omega - \\omega_0)^2 + \\lambda^2\\right]}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_0$ is the characteristic coupling rate and $\\lambda$ is the spectral width, or inverse memory time, of the reservoir. Substituting $\\omega = \\omega_0$ into the expression for $J(\\omega)$ yields:\n$$\nJ(\\omega_0) = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda^2}{2\\pi \\left[(\\omega_0 - \\omega_0)^2 + \\lambda^2\\right]} = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda^2}{2\\pi \\lambda^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_0}{2\\pi}\n$$\nTherefore, the effective Markovian decay rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma_\\mathrm{M} = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_0}{2\\pi} \\right) = \\gamma_0\n$$\nThis is a key result: the Markovian decay rate is identical to the coupling strength parameter $\\gamma_0$. The population of the excited state in the Markovian model, $P_e^\\mathrm{M}(t)$, is thus described by a simple exponential decay:\n$$\nP_e^\\mathrm{M}(t) = P_e(0) e^{-\\gamma_\\mathrm{M} t} = e^{-\\gamma_0 t}\n$$\nwhere we have used the initial condition $P_e(0) = 1$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Non-Markovian Amplitude $c_e(t)$**\n\nThe non-Markovian dynamics are governed by the integro-differential equation for the excited-state amplitude $c_e(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} c_e(t) = - \\int_0^t f(t-\\tau) c_e(\\tau)\\, d\\tau\n$$\nwith the initial condition $c_e(0) = 1$. The kernel $f(t-\\tau)$ is the reservoir correlation (or memory) function. For a zero-temperature reservoir, it is the one-sided Fourier transform of the spectral density:\n$$\nf(\\tau) = \\int_0^\\infty J(\\omega) e^{-i(\\omega-\\omega_0)\\tau} d\\omega\n$$\nAssuming that the system frequency $\\omega_0$ is large compared to other relevant frequencies, we can extend the lower integration limit from $0$ to $-\\infty$ without significant error. Let $x = \\omega - \\omega_0$.\n$$\nf(\\tau) \\approx \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda^2}{2\\pi (x^2 + \\lambda^2)} e^{-ix\\tau} dx = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda^2}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-ix\\tau}}{x^2 + \\lambda^2} dx\n$$\nThis integral can be solved using the residue theorem. For $\\tau > 0$, we close the contour in the lower half-plane, enclosing the simple pole at $x = -i\\lambda$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-ix\\tau}}{(x-i\\lambda)(x+i\\lambda)} dx = -2\\pi i \\, \\text{Res}(x=-i\\lambda) = -2\\pi i \\left( \\frac{e^{-i(-i\\lambda)\\tau}}{-2i\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda} e^{-\\lambda\\tau}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $f(\\tau)$:\n$$\nf(\\tau) = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda^2}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda} e^{-\\lambda\\tau} \\right) = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda}{2} e^{-\\lambda\\tau}\n$$\nThe dynamical equation for $c_e(t)$ can be solved efficiently using the Laplace transform. Let $C_e(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{c_e(t)\\}$ and $F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}$. The equation transforms to:\n$$\ns C_e(s) - c_e(0) = -F(s) C_e(s)\n$$\nThe Laplace transform of the exponential kernel is $F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda}{2} e^{-\\lambda t}\\} = \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda/2}{s+\\lambda}$. Using $c_e(0)=1$, we solve for $C_e(s)$:\n$$\nC_e(s) [s + F(s)] = 1 \\implies C_e(s) = \\frac{1}{s + F(s)} = \\frac{1}{s + \\frac{\\gamma_0 \\lambda/2}{s+\\lambda}} = \\frac{s+\\lambda}{s(s+\\lambda) + \\gamma_0\\lambda/2} = \\frac{s+\\lambda}{s^2 + \\lambda s + \\gamma_0\\lambda/2}\n$$\nTo find $c_e(t)$, we perform the inverse Laplace transform of $C_e(s)$. The behavior of the solution depends on the roots of the denominator, $s^2 + \\lambda s + \\gamma_0\\lambda/2 = 0$. The roots are given by:\n$$\ns_{\\pm} = \\frac{-\\lambda \\pm \\sqrt{\\lambda^2 - 2\\gamma_0\\lambda}}{2}\n$$\nThe nature of the solution is determined by the sign of the discriminant $\\Delta = \\lambda^2 - 2\\gamma_0\\lambda$. We distinguish three regimes:\n\n**Case A: Overdamped Regime ($\\lambda > 2\\gamma_0$)**\nThe discriminant is positive, leading to two distinct real roots. Let $\\Omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 - 2\\gamma_0\\lambda}}{2}$. The inverse Laplace transform is found via partial fraction expansion, yielding:\n$$\nc_e(t) = e^{-\\lambda t/2} \\left( \\cosh(\\Omega t) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Omega} \\sinh(\\Omega t) \\right)\n$$\nThis corresponds to a monotonic, non-oscillatory decay, which is faster than the Markovian exponential at short times due to the $e^{-\\lambda t/2}$ prefactor.\n\n**Case B: Underdamped (Oscillatory) Regime ($\\lambda < 2\\gamma_0$)**\nThe discriminant is negative, leading to complex conjugate roots. Let $\\Omega' = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\gamma_0\\lambda - \\lambda^2}}{2}$. The solution involves trigonometric functions, corresponding to oscillations in the amplitude:\n$$\nc_e(t) = e^{-\\lambda t/2} \\left( \\cos(\\Omega' t) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Omega'} \\sin(\\Omega' t) \\right)\n$$\nThe population $P_e^\\mathrm{NM}(t) = |c_e(t)|^2$ will exhibit damped oscillations, a clear signature of non-Markovian dynamics where information flows back from the reservoir to the system.\n\n**Case C: Critically Damped Regime ($\\lambda = 2\\gamma_0$)**\nThe discriminant is zero, resulting in a single repeated real root at $s = -\\lambda/2$. The inverse Laplace transform gives:\n$$\nc_e(t) = e^{-\\lambda t/2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} t \\right)\n$$\nThis represents the boundary case between monotonic and oscillatory decay.\n\nIn all cases, the non-Markovian population is $P_e^\\mathrm{NM}(t) = |c_e(t)|^2$. Since $c_e(t)$ is real-valued in all three regimes, this is simply $(c_e(t))^2$.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe program will implement these derived analytical solutions. For each test case, specified by the parameters $(\\gamma_0, \\lambda, T)$, the following steps are performed:\n1. A uniform time grid of $N=4001$ points is created over the interval $[0, T]$.\n2. The Markovian population $P_e^\\mathrm{M}(t) = e^{-\\gamma_0 t}$ is calculated on this grid.\n3. The non-Markovian population $P_e^\\mathrm{NM}(t)$ is calculated by first determining the regime (overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped) based on the ratio $\\lambda/(2\\gamma_0)$ and then applying the corresponding analytical formula for $c_e(t)$ and squaring the result.\n4. The maximum absolute deviation, $\\Delta_\\mathrm{max} = \\max_{t} |P_e^\\mathrm{NM}(t) - P_e^\\mathrm{M}(t)|$, is computed over the time grid.\n5. The result for each case is rounded to six decimal places as required.\nThe provided test cases are designed to probe the different dynamical regimes and the approach to the Markovian limit.",
