Understanding their relative intensities is crucial for interpreting experimental data. This exercise  bridges the gap between quantum mechanics and statistical physics by asking you to apply the fundamental Boltzmann distribution. By calculating the thermal population ratio of these two exciton states, you will gain a quantitative understanding of why the lower-energy A exciton typically dominates optical measurements at room temperature.",

            "problem": "Consider a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) such as molybdenum disulfide ($\\text{MoS}_2$), in which strong spin-orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the valence band at the Brillouin zone corners, producing two spin-split valence subbands. Direct interband optical transitions at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys from the upper valence subband to the conduction band minimum form the so-called $A$ exciton, while transitions from the lower valence subband form the $B$ exciton. Assume the conduction band spin splitting is negligible compared to the valence band splitting, so that the energy separation between the $B$ and $A$ excitonic transitions is equal to the valence band spin-orbit splitting $\\Delta_{v}$. In thermal quasi-equilibrium at temperature $T$, assume that excitons are noninteracting, their subband degeneracies are equal, and their populations are governed by Boltzmann statistics.\n\nStarting from the Boltzmann distribution of populations over discrete energy states, derive an expression for the ratio of thermal populations $N_{B}/N_{A}$ of $B$ to $A$ excitons in terms of $\\Delta_{v}$, the Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, and the temperature $T$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the ratio of thermal populations of $B$ excitons to $A$ excitons, $N_{B}/N_{A}$, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The system is described as being in thermal quasi-equilibrium at a temperature $T$, with populations governed by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nAccording to the principles of statistical mechanics, the population $N_i$ of a quantum state with energy $E_i$ and degeneracy $g_i$ at thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$N_i \\propto g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nLet the energy of the $A$ exciton state be denoted by $E_A$ and its degeneracy by $g_A$. The population of $A$ excitons, $N_A$, is then proportional to:\n$$N_A \\propto g_A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, let the energy of the $B$ exciton state be $E_B$ and its degeneracy be $g_B$. The population of $B$ excitons, $N_B$, is proportional to:\n$$N_B \\propto g_B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the $A$ exciton is formed from a transition involving the upper valence subband, while the $B$ exciton is formed from a transition involving the lower valence subband. This implies that the $B$ exciton has a higher energy than the $A$ exciton. The energy separation between these two excitonic transitions is given as the valence band spin-orbit splitting, $\\Delta_{v}$. Therefore, we can write the relationship between their energies as:\n$$E_B - E_A = \\Delta_{v}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the populations, $N_B/N_A$. Using the proportionality relations from the Boltzmann distribution, we can write the ratio as:\n$$\\frac{N_B}{N_A} = \\frac{g_B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{g_A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_{B}T}\\right)}$$\n\nThe problem specifies the assumption that the subband degeneracies are equal, which means $g_A = g_B$. The degeneracy factors in the numerator and denominator thus cancel out:\n$$\\frac{N_B}{N_A} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_{B}T}\\right)}$$\n\nUsing the property of exponential functions, $\\frac{\\exp(x)}{\\exp(y)} = \\exp(x-y)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\\frac{N_B}{N_A} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_{B}T} - \\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_A - E_B}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the energy difference $E_A - E_B = -\\Delta_{v}$ into the equation, we arrive at the final symbolic expression for the ratio of populations:\n$$\\frac{N_B}{N_A} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{v}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThis concludes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must evaluate this ratio numerically using the provided values: $\\Delta_{v} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The Boltzmann constant $k_B$ in units of electron-volts per Kelvin is approximately $k_B \\approx 8.6173 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$:\n$$k_B T \\approx (8.6173 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the exponent $-\\frac{\\Delta_{v}}{k_{B}T}$:\n$$-\\frac{\\Delta_{v}}{k_{B}T} \\approx -\\frac{0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx -5.8023$$\n\nFinally, we compute the exponential of this value to find the ratio:\n$$\\frac{N_B}{N_A} = \\exp(-5.8023) \\approx 0.0030198$$\n\nThe problem requires the final ratio to be rounded to three significant figures as a dimensionless number.\nRounding $0.0030198$ to three significant figures gives $0.00302$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond their intrinsic properties, the true potential of 2D materials is often unlocked by our ability to actively tune them. Mechanical strain is one of the most powerful tools for this \"strain engineering,\" allowing for continuous modification of the electronic band structure. This practice  introduces the foundational concept of deformation potential theory, a first-order model that connects macroscopic strain to microscopic changes in band energies.

            "problem": "Consider a monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) with a direct bandgap at the Brillouin-zone corner point $K$. In the harmonic elastic regime, treat the uniform in-plane strain as a small perturbation to the crystal potential. For an equi-biaxial strain state, the strain tensor can be written with components $\\epsilon_{xx}=\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon_{yy}=\\epsilon$, with $\\epsilon_{xy}=0$, where $\\epsilon$ is the scalar magnitude of the applied biaxial strain. In linear deformation-potential theory, the leading (first-order) correction to the energy of a band edge is governed by a hydrostatic deformation potential that couples to the scalar invariant of the strain tensor. Using this framework and symmetry considerations appropriate for the $K$ valley in a monolayer TMD, derive, from first principles, an expression for the bandgap change $\\Delta E_{g}$ in terms of the conduction-band and valence-band hydrostatic deformation potentials and the strain tensor. Then evaluate $\\Delta E_{g}$ under a small equi-biaxial tensile strain of magnitude $\\epsilon=0.01$ given that the difference of the hydrostatic deformation potentials satisfies $a_{c}-a_{v}=5\\,\\text{eV}$. Finally, discuss the validity of the linear regime for $\\epsilon=0.01$ in the context of neglecting higher-order (quadratic) strain corrections to the band-edge energies. Express your final numerical value for $\\Delta E_{g}$ in electronvolts (eV) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The bandgap, $E_g$, is defined as the energy difference between the conduction band minimum (CBM), $E_c$, and the valence band maximum (VBM), $E_v$. For the direct gap at the $K$ point, we have:\n$$E_g = E_c - E_v$$\nWhen the material is subjected to strain, the band edge energies shift. According to the linear deformation-potential theory stated in the problem, the first-order change in the energy of a band edge is proportional to the scalar invariant of the strain tensor. For a two-dimensional system, the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is given by:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} & \\epsilon_{xy} \\\\ \\epsilon_{yx} & \\epsilon_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe primary scalar invariant is the trace of the tensor, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}$.\n\nThe change in the CBM energy, $\\Delta E_c$, is given by its coupling to the strain via the conduction band hydrostatic deformation potential, $a_c$:\n$$\\Delta E_c = a_c \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = a_c (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\nSimilarly, the change in the VBM energy, $\\Delta E_v$, is determined by the valence band hydrostatic deformation potential, $a_v$:\n$$\\Delta E_v = a_v \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = a_v (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\n\nThe new bandgap, $E'_g$, under strain is the difference between the new band edge energies:\n$$E'_g = (E_c + \\Delta E_c) - (E_v + \\Delta E_v)$$\nThe change in the bandgap, $\\Delta E_g$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta E_g = E'_g - E_g = [(E_c + \\Delta E_c) - (E_v + \\Delta E_v)] - (E_c - E_v)$$\n$$\\Delta E_g = \\Delta E_c - \\Delta E_v$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta E_c$ and $\\Delta E_v$:\n$$\\Delta E_g = a_c (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) - a_v (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\nFactoring out the strain term gives the general expression for the bandgap change in terms of the deformation potentials and the strain tensor components:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (a_c - a_v)(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\nFor the specific case of equi-biaxial strain described, we have $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (a_c - a_v)(2\\epsilon)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the bandgap change.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation, we are given the following values:\n- The scalar magnitude of the tensile strain: $\\epsilon = 0.01$. Since it is tensile, $\\epsilon$ is positive.\n- The difference of the hydrostatic deformation potentials: $a_c - a_v = 5\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (5\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (2 \\times 0.01)$$\n$$\\Delta E_g = (5\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (0.02)$$\n$$\\Delta E_g = 0.1\\,\\text{eV}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as $0.1000\\,\\text{eV}$. The positive sign indicates that the bandgap increases under this specific tensile strain and for the given deformation potentials.\n\nFinally, for the discussion on the validity of the linear regime, the linear deformation-potential theory represents the first-order term of a Taylor series expansion of the band-edge energy with respect to strain. The full expansion can be written as:\n$$E(\\epsilon) = E(0) + \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\epsilon^2}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon^2 + O(\\epsilon^3)$$\nThe linear approximation is valid if the contribution from the linear term is significantly larger than the contribution from the quadratic and higher-order terms. For the change in energy, this means:\n$$|\\Delta E_{\\text{linear}}| = \\left| \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon \\right| \\gg |\\Delta E_{\\text{quadratic}}| = \\left| \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\epsilon^2}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon^2 \\right|$$\nThe strain magnitude given is $\\epsilon = 0.01$, which corresponds to a $1\\%$ lattice deformation. In solid-state physics, a strain of $1\\%$ is often considered the upper limit of the linear elastic regime for bulk materials. For 2D materials like TMDs, which can be more flexible, this value is still substantial and lies at the boundary where non-linear effects in the electronic structure can become apparent.\n\nThe validity of neglecting the quadratic term depends on the magnitude of the second-order deformation potentials (related to $\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\epsilon^2}$) relative to the first-order potentials ($a_c$, $a_v$). Without knowledge of these second-order coefficients, a precise quantification of the error is not possible. However, we can state that for a strain of $\\epsilon = 0.01$, the quadratic term's contribution, scaling with $\\epsilon^2 = 0.0001$, may not be entirely negligible. Experimental and computational studies on specific TMDs (like $\\text{MoS}_2$ or $\\text{WSe}_2$) have shown that bandgaps can exhibit a noticeably non-linear (often parabolic) dependence on strain, and that other phenomena, such as a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, can occur at strain levels in the $1-2\\%$ range.\n\nIn conclusion, while the linear model provides a valuable and straightforward first-order estimation, applying it at $\\epsilon=0.01$ is an approximation. One should be aware that higher-order corrections might be required for a more accurate description, and the calculated value of $\\Delta E_g = 0.1000\\,\\text{eV}$ should be understood as the leading-order contribution to the total bandgap change.",
