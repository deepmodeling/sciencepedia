Direct interband optical transitions at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys from the upper valence subband to the conduction band minimum form the so-called $A$ exciton, while transitions from the lower valence subband form the $B$ exciton. Assume the conduction band spin splitting is negligible compared to the valence band splitting, so that the energy separation between the $B$ and $A$ excitonic transitions is equal to the valence band spin-orbit splitting $\\Delta_{v}$. In thermal quasi-equilibrium at temperature $T$, assume that excitons are noninteracting, their subband degeneracies are equal, and their populations are governed by Boltzmann statistics.\n\nStarting from the Boltzmann distribution of populations over discrete energy states, derive an expression for the ratio of thermal populations $N_{B}/N_{A}$ of $B$ to $A$ excitons in terms of $\\Delta_{v}$, the Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, and the temperature $T$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the ratio of thermal populations of $B$ excitons to $A$ excitons, $N_{B}/N_{A}$, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The system is described as being in thermal quasi-equilibrium at a temperature $T$, with populations governed by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\nAccording to the principles of statistical mechanics, the population $N_i$ of a quantum state with energy $E_i$ and degeneracy $g_i$ at thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$N_i \\propto g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nLet the energy of the $A$ exciton state be denoted by $E_A$ and its degeneracy by $g_A$. The population of $A$ excitons, $N_A$, is then proportional to:\n$$N_A \\propto g_A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, let the energy of the $B$ exciton state be $E_B$ and its degeneracy be $g_B$.

This implies that the $B$ exciton has a higher energy than the $A$ exciton. The energy separation between these two excitonic transitions is given as the valence band spin-orbit splitting, $\\Delta_{v}$. Therefore, we can write the relationship between their energies as:\n$$E_B - E_A = \\Delta_{v}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the populations, $N_B/N_A$. Using the proportionality relations from the Boltzmann distribution, we can write the ratio as:\n$$\\frac{N_B}{N_A} = \\frac{g_B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{g_A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_{B}T}\\right)}$$\n\nThe problem specifies the assumption that the subband degeneracies are equal, which means $g_A = g_B$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the change in the direct bandgap of a monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) under equi-biaxial strain, a numerical evaluation of this change for a specific strain, and a discussion on the validity of the linear model used.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Bandgap Change $\\Delta E_g$**\n\nThe bandgap, $E_g$, is defined as the energy difference between the conduction band minimum (CBM), $E_c$, and the valence band maximum (VBM), $E_v$. For the direct gap at the $K$ point, we have:\n$$E_g = E_c - E_v$$\nWhen the material is subjected to strain, the band edge energies shift. According to the linear deformation-potential theory stated in the problem, the first-order change in the energy of a band edge is proportional to the scalar invariant of the strain tensor. For a two-dimensional system, the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is given by:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} & \\epsilon_{xy} \\\\ \\epsilon_{yx} & \\epsilon_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe primary scalar invariant is the trace of the tensor, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}$.\n\nThe change in the CBM energy, $\\Delta E_c$, is given by its coupling to the strain via the conduction band hydrostatic deformation potential, $a_c$:\n$$\\Delta E_c = a_c \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = a_c (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\nSimilarly, the change in the VBM energy, $\\Delta E_v$, is determined by the valence band hydrostatic deformation potential, $a_v$:\n$$\\Delta E_v = a_v \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = a_v (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\n\nThe new bandgap, $E'_g$, under strain is the difference between the new band edge energies:\n$$E'_g = (E_c + \\Delta E_c) - (E_v + \\Delta E_v)$$\nThe change in the bandgap, $\\Delta E_g$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta E_g = E'_g - E_g = [(E_c + \\Delta E_c) - (E_v + \\Delta E_v)] - (E_c - E_v)$$\n$$\\Delta E_g = \\Delta E_c - \\Delta E_v$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta E_c$ and $\\Delta E_v$:\n$$\\Delta E_g = a_c (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}) - a_v (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\nFactoring out the strain term gives the general expression for the bandgap change in terms of the deformation potentials and the strain tensor components:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (a_c - a_v)(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy})$$\nFor the specific case of equi-biaxial strain described, we have $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (a_c - a_v)(2\\epsilon)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the bandgap change.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $\\Delta E_g$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- The scalar magnitude of the tensile strain: $\\epsilon = 0.01$. Since it is tensile, $\\epsilon$ is positive.\n- The difference of the hydrostatic deformation potentials: $a_c - a_v = 5\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (5\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (2 \\times 0.01)$$\n$$\\Delta E_g = (5\\,\\text{eV}) \\times (0.02)$$\n$$\\Delta E_g = 0.1\\,\\text{eV}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as $0.1000\\,\\text{eV}$. The positive sign indicates that the bandgap increases under this specific tensile strain and for the given deformation potentials.\n\n**Part 3: Discussion on the Validity of the Linear Regime**\n\nThe linear deformation-potential theory represents the first-order term of a Taylor series expansion of the band-edge energy with respect to strain. The full expansion can be written as:\n$$E(\\epsilon) = E(0) + \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\epsilon^2}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon^2 + O(\\epsilon^3)$$\nThe linear approximation is valid if the contribution from the linear term is significantly larger than the contribution from the quadratic and higher-order terms. For the change in energy, this means:\n$$|\\Delta E_{\\text{linear}}| = \\left| \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon \\right| \\gg |\\Delta E_{\\text{quadratic}}| = \\left| \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\epsilon^2}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\epsilon^2 \\right|$$\nThe strain magnitude given is $\\epsilon = 0.01$, which corresponds to a $1\\%$ lattice deformation. In solid-state physics, a strain of $1\\%$ is often considered the upper limit of the linear elastic regime for bulk materials. For 2D materials like TMDs, which can be more flexible, this value is still substantial and lies at the boundary where non-linear effects in the electronic structure can become apparent.\n\nThe validity of neglecting the quadratic term depends on the magnitude of the second-order deformation potentials (related to $\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\epsilon^2}$) relative to the first-order potentials ($a_c$, $a_v$). Without knowledge of these second-order coefficients, a precise quantification of the error is not possible. However, we can state that for a strain of $\\epsilon = 0.01$, the quadratic term's contribution, scaling with $\\epsilon^2 = 0.0001$, may not be entirely negligible. Experimental and computational studies on specific TMDs (like $\\text{MoS}_2$ or $\\text{WSe}_2$) have shown that bandgaps can exhibit a noticeably non-linear (often parabolic) dependence on strain, and that other phenomena, such as a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, can occur at strain levels in the $1-2\\%$ range.\n\nIn conclusion, while the linear model provides a valuable and straightforward first-order estimation, applying it at $\\epsilon=0.01$ is an approximation. One should be aware that higher-order corrections might be required for a more accurate description, and the calculated value of $\\Delta E_g = 0.1000\\,\\text{eV}$ should be understood as the leading-order contribution to the total bandgap change.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided \"Fundamental base for analysis\" consists of established principles in the solid-state physics of two-dimensional materials and their nanostructures. The problem is a valid test of applying these principles to deduce the electronic properties of $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanoribbons.\n\nThe core principles for analysis are:\n1.  **Valley Projection:** The projection of bulk Brillouin zone corner points $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K}^{\\prime}$ onto the $1$D Brillouin zone of the nanoribbon edge depends on the edge orientation (zigzag vs. armchair). The parallel momentum component $k_{\\parallel}$ is a good quantum number.\n2.  **Intervalley Hybridization:** For zigzag edges, $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K}^{\\prime}$ project to distinct $k_{\\parallel}$ values, suppressing hybridization between states originating from the two valleys. For armchair edges, they project to the same $k_{\\parallel}$, allowing strong hybridization.\n3.  **Edge States and Metallicity:** Reduced atomic coordination at the edge creates unsaturated \"dangling bonds.\" These can form electronic states within the bulk band gap. If these bands are partially filled (i.e., cross the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$) and are not gapped by hybridization, the edge becomes metallic.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on these principles.\n\n**Statement A: A Mo-terminated zigzag edge generically hosts metallic bands derived from Mo $d$ orbitals due to reduced coordination, and by the same argument an S-terminated zigzag edge and an armchair edge are always metallic as well.**\n\nThis statement consists of two parts. The first part claims that a Mo-terminated zigzag edge is metallic. This is consistent with the base analysis: reduced Mo coordination creates dangling bonds from Mo $d$ orbitals, and the zigzag orientation suppresses gapping mechanisms like intervalley hybridization. These states are known to be partially filled, leading to metallicity.\n\nThe second part of the statement claims that \"by the same argument\" S-terminated zigzag edges and armchair edges are \"always metallic\". This is an invalid overgeneralization.\n-   **Armchair Edge:** The \"Fundamental base for analysis\" explicitly states that for the armchair orientation, $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K}^{\\prime}$ valleys project to the same $k_{\\parallel}$, allowing for \"strong intervalley hybridization.\" This hybridization is a mechanism that can open a gap in the edge state spectrum, leading to semiconducting behavior. Thus, armchair edges are not \"always metallic\". In fact, ideal stoichiometric armchair $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanoribbons are typically semiconducting.\n-   **S-terminated Zigzag Edge:** The argument does not apply in the same way. The dangling bonds at an S-terminated edge originate from sulfur $p$ orbitals, not molybdenum $d$ orbitals. The energy levels and electron filling of these states are different. Standard electron counting rules show that the dangling bond states of the S-terminated zigzag edge are typically fully occupied and lie within the valence band, thus not crossing $E_{F}$ and not leading to metallicity.\n\nThe logic \"by the same argument\" is flawed because the atomic termination and edge orientation fundamentally change the conditions.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Statement B: For an ideal Mo-terminated zigzag edge without passivation, the conservation of $k_{\\parallel}$ implies that the $K$ and $K^{\\prime}$ valleys project to different $k_{\\parallel}$ values, which suppresses intervalley hybridization at a given $k_{\\parallel}$. Combined with partially filled Mo $d$-derived dangling-bond states from reduced edge coordination, this allows edge bands to cross $E_{F}$, yielding metallicity.**\n\nThis statement provides a step-by-step physical argument for the metallicity of the Mo-terminated zigzag edge. Let's break it down against the provided base:\n1.  \"...the $K$ and $K^{\\prime}$ valleys project to different $k_{\\parallel}$ values...\": This is a direct quote of the principle given in the \"Fundamental base for analysis\" for zigzag edges.\n2.  \"...which suppresses intervalley hybridization at a given $k_{\\parallel}$...\": This is the direct and correct consequence of the valleys projecting to different momenta. To hybridize, states must have the same conserved quantum numbers, including $k_{\\parallel}$.\n3.  \"...partially filled Mo $d$-derived dangling-bond states from reduced edge coordination...\": This is precisely the situation described in the third principle of the base analysis. The atoms at the Mo-edge have fewer S neighbors, leaving dangling bonds with Mo $d$-orbital character. The partial filling ensures these states lie near $E_F$.\n4.  \"...this allows edge bands to cross $E_{F}$, yielding metallicity.\": The combination of partially filled states and the suppression of hybridization (which could have opened a gap) correctly leads to the conclusion of a metallic edge band crossing $E_{F}$.\n\nThis statement is a complete and correct application of the provided principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Statement C: The armchair edge must be metallic because translation symmetry along the armchair direction forbids intervalley mixing; the edge states are dominated by S $p$ orbitals that necessarily cross $E_{F}$.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods.\n1.  \"...translation symmetry along the armchair direction forbids intervalley mixing...\": This is a direct contradiction to the \"Fundamental base for analysis,\" which states that for the armchair orientation, the valleys project to the *same* $k_{\\parallel}$, which *allows strong intervalley hybridization*.\n2.  \"...edge states are dominated by S $p$ orbitals...\": The problem states that the low-energy bands near the gap in the bulk are dominated by Mo $d$ orbitals. While S $p$ orbitals participate in bonding, the states most likely to form edge states in the gap are derived from the Mo $d$ orbitals that constitute the bulk band edges.\n3.  \"...that necessarily cross $E_{F}$...\": This is an unsubstantiated claim. As explained in the analysis of statement A, the strong intervalley mixing allowed at armchair edges typically opens a gap, making the edge semiconducting, not metallic.\n\nThe primary premise of this statement is factually incorrect according to the problem's own base.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Statement D: Chemical passivation of a Mo-terminated zigzag edge (for example, by S or H adsorption) can saturate dangling bonds and open a gap in the edge spectrum, suppressing metallic edge conduction.**\n\nThis statement describes the effect of passivation.\n-   The metallic nature of the Mo-zigzag edge is due to \"unsaturated orbitals ('dangling bonds')\", as per the base analysis.\n-   Chemical passivation involves adsorbing atoms (like S or H) onto the edge atoms, forming new chemical bonds.\n-   This process \"saturates\" the dangling bonds, meaning the previously unsaturated orbitals now participate in these new, stable bonds.\n-   By eliminating the dangling bond states, which were responsible for the metallic band within the bulk gap, the electronic structure is altered. These states are typically moved to energies far from $E_{F}$ (deep into the valence or high into the conduction bands).\n-   The removal of the states at $E_{F}$ results in the opening of a gap in the edge spectrum and the suppression of metallic conduction. This is a standard and physically sound concept.\n\nThe statement is a logical consequence of the principles underlying edge state physics.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Statement E: Strong spin-orbit coupling in $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ enforces an insulating edge in the absence of a nontrivial topological invariant; therefore, zigzag edges cannot be metallic in a topologically trivial $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ monolayer.**\n\nThis statement makes an erroneous connection between topology and edge metallicity.\n-   The physics of topological insulators establishes a bulk-boundary correspondence: a bulk with a nontrivial topological invariant must host protected, gapless boundary states.\n-   The converse is not true. A topologically trivial material is not guaranteed to have insulating boundaries. It simply lacks the *topological protection* for any boundary states it might have.\n-   Metallic edge states can still exist for non-topological reasons, often called \"trivial\" or \"accidental\" edge states. Their existence depends on specific details like crystal symmetry and surface/edge termination, rather than a bulk topological property.\n-   The metallicity of the Mo-terminated zigzag edge in $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ is a well-known example of such an accidental metallic state, arising from the dangling bonds and symmetries discussed in statement B. Monolayer $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ is considered a topologically trivial semiconductor.\n-   Therefore, the premise that \"strong spin-orbit coupling...enforces an insulating edge in the absence of a nontrivial topological invariant\" is false. Strong spin-orbit coupling might modify the edge bands, but it does not generically eliminate metallicity in a trivial insulator.\n\nThe argument presented is logically flawed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Statement F: A high density of states at $E_{F}$ associated with a flat or weakly dispersive Mo-terminated zigzag edge band can satisfy a Stoner-like criterion $I N(E_{F}) \\gtrsim 1$ (with $I$ the exchange interaction parameter), favoring spontaneous spin polarization and spin splitting of the metallic edge band even if the bulk is nonmagnetic.**\n\nThis statement proposes a magnetic instability at the Mo-zigzag edge.\n-   From statement B, we established that the Mo-zigzag edge is metallic, meaning it has a finite density of states at the Fermi level, $N(E_{F})$.\n-   Detailed calculations show that these edge states form a relatively flat, or weakly dispersive, band. A flat band ($E(k) \\approx \\text{constant}$) leads to a very high density of states, since $N(E) \\propto \\int dS / |\\nabla_k E|$, and the gradient is small.\n-   The Stoner criterion for itinerant ferromagnetism, $I \\cdot N(E_{F}) \\gtrsim 1$, states that if the product of the effective electron-electron exchange interaction strength ($I$) and the density of states at the Fermi level ($N(E_F)$) is greater than unity, the non-magnetic (paramagnetic) state becomes unstable.\n-   The system can then lower its total energy by spontaneously spin-polarizing, which means creating an imbalance between spin-up and spin-down electrons. This results in ferromagnetism and a spin-splitting of the electronic bands.\n-   The bulk $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ is non-magnetic. The statement correctly suggests that this magnetic instability can be a purely edge-related phenomenon, driven by the unique electronic structure (flat bands) of the zigzag termination.\n\nThis is a standard and physically correct application of the Stoner model to a system with a high density of states at the Fermi level.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
