It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the complete solution.\n\n**Derivation of Landau Level Degeneracy**\n\nWe aim to find the total degeneracy of a single Landau level per unit area. This degeneracy arises from three sources: orbital degeneracy, spin degeneracy, and valley degeneracy.\n\nFirst, we determine the orbital degeneracy by counting the number of available quantum states for a given Landau level. We consider a 2D system of area $A = L_x \\times L_y$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The problem specifies a gauge choice that preserves translational symmetry along one direction. We choose the Landau gauge, $\\mathbf{A} = (0, Bx, 0)$, which satisfies $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a charged particle is modified by the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$. For a low-energy electron in graphene (charge $q = -e$), the canonical momentum $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}$ is replaced by the mechanical momentum $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\Pi}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q\\mathbf{A} = \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e\\mathbf{A}$.\n\nIn the Landau gauge, the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on the $y$ coordinate. Consequently, the momentum operator in the $y$-direction, $\\hat{p}_y$, commutes with the Hamiltonian, $[\\hat{H}, \\hat{p}_y] = 0$. This means that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are also eigenstates of $\\hat{p}_y$. We can write the wavefunction in the form of a plane wave in the $y$-direction:\n$$ \\Psi(x, y) = e^{i k_y y} \\phi(x) $$\nwhere $\\hbar k_y$ is the eigenvalue of the momentum operator $\\hat{p}_y$.\n\nThe center of the cyclotron orbit in the classical picture is given by $x_c = x - v_y / \\omega_c$, where $\\omega_c = eB/m$ is the cyclotron frequency. Using $m v_y = p_y$, this becomes $x_c = x - p_y / (eB)$. In the quantum mechanical description, the center of the particle's wavefunction in the $x$-direction is given by the expectation value related to the conserved momentum $k_y$:\n$$ x_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB} $$\nThis value $x_0$ represents the guiding center of the quantum state's probability distribution along the $x$-axis. For the electron to be confined within the sample of width $L_x$, its guiding center must lie within the sample. We can impose the condition $0 \\le x_0 \\le L_x$. This translates to a constraint on the allowed values of $k_y$:\n$$ 0 \\le -\\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB} \\le L_x $$\n$$ -\\frac{eBL_x}{\\hbar} \\le k_y \\le 0 $$\nThe range of allowed values for $k_y$ is therefore $\\Delta k_y = \\frac{eBL_x}{\\hbar}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the number of discrete values $k_y$ can take within this range. Applying periodic boundary conditions along the $y$-direction of length $L_y$ (a standard approach for large systems that yields the correct density of states), we require that the wavefunction is periodic: $\\Psi(x, y+L_y) = \\Psi(x,y)$. This implies $e^{i k_y (y+L_y)} = e^{i k_y y}$, which leads to the quantization of $k_y$:\n$$ k_y L_y = 2\\pi n_y \\implies k_y = \\frac{2\\pi n_y}{L_y} $$\nwhere $n_y$ is an integer. The separation between adjacent allowed values of $k_y$ is $\\delta k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{L_y}$.\n\nThe number of distinct orbital states, $N_{\\text{orb}}$, for a single Landau level is the total allowed range of $k_y$ divided by the spacing between discrete $k_y$ values:\n$$ N_{\\text{orb}} = \\frac{\\Delta k_y}{\\delta k_y} = \\frac{eBL_x/\\hbar}{2\\pi/L_y} = \\frac{eB L_x L_y}{2\\pi\\hbar} $$\nUsing the definitions of the sample area $A = L_x L_y$ and the reduced Planck constant $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$, we find the orbital degeneracy:\n$$ N_{\\text{orb}} = \\frac{eBA}{h} $$\nThis is the number of orbital states per Landau level. This result is universal for any 2D electron gas and corresponds to the number of magnetic flux quanta, $\\Phi_0 = h/e$, that penetrate the sample area $A$.\n\nThe problem states that graphene possesses additional internal degrees of freedom. There is a twofold spin degeneracy ($g_s = 2$) and a twofold valley degeneracy ($g_v = 2$, for the K and K' valleys). To get the total degeneracy of a Landau level, we multiply the orbital degeneracy by these factors:\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} = g_s g_v N_{\\text{orb}} = (2)(2) \\frac{eBA}{h} = \\frac{4eBA}{h} $$\nThe problem asks for the degeneracy per unit area, which we denote as $n_B$:\n$$ n_B = \\frac{N_{\\text{total}}}{A} = \\frac{4eB}{h} $$\nFinally, expressing this in terms of the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$, as requested:\n$$ n_B = \\frac{4eB}{2\\pi\\hbar} = \\frac{2eB}{\\pi\\hbar} $$\n\n**Qualitative Effect of Zeeman Energy**\n\nIn the absence of a Zeeman effect, each orbital Landau level with energy $E_n$ is fourfold degenerate, corresponding to spin-up and spin-down electrons in each of the two valleys (K and K').\n\nThe application of a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ couples to the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s$. This interaction is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_Z = - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$. The electron's magnetic moment is related to its spin $\\mathbf{S}$ by $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_s = -g_s \\mu_B \\mathbf{S}/\\hbar$, where $\\mu_B = e\\hbar/(2m_e)$ is the Bohr magneton and $g_s \\approx 2$ is the electron g-factor. For a field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the Zeeman energy becomes:\n$$ E_Z = g_s \\mu_B B S_z/\\hbar $$\nThe spin projection $S_z$ has eigenvalues $\\pm\\hbar/2$. Thus, the Zeeman interaction splits the energy of the spin-up ($S_z = +\\hbar/2$) and spin-down ($S_z = -\\hbar/2$) states. The energy of a Landau level $E_n$ is shifted by $\\Delta E_Z$:\n$$ E_{n, \\text{spin}} = E_n \\pm \\frac{1}{2} g_s \\mu_B B $$\nThis energy correction **lifts the spin degeneracy**. Each original fourfold degenerate Landau level splits into two distinct energy levels, separated by the Zeeman energy $\\Delta E_{\\text{split}} = g_s \\mu_B B$. Each of these new levels remains twofold degenerate due to the preserved valley degeneracy.\n\nIn the strong-field regime, this splitting is significant. In experiments such as quantum Hall measurements or scanning tunneling spectroscopy, this effect is observed as a splitting of each main Landau peak (or Hall plateau) into two.\n\nThe condition under which the spin degeneracy is **effectively lifted** is when the Zeeman splitting energy is larger than the energy broadening $\\Gamma$ of the Landau levels. This broadening can be caused by thermal effects (proportional to $k_B T$) or by disorder-induced scattering (inversely proportional to the quasiparticle lifetime $\\tau$, $\\Gamma \\sim \\hbar/\\tau$). Therefore, the spin splitting becomes resolvable when:\n$$ g_s \\mu_B B > \\Gamma $$\nFor massless Dirac fermions specifically, the Landau level energies scale as $E_n \\propto \\sqrt{B}$, whereas the Zeeman splitting scales as $\\Delta E_Z \\propto B$. In the strong-field limit (large $B$), the Zeeman splitting grows faster than the separation between low-index Landau levels, which can lead to a complex reordering of the energy spectrum where spin-split levels from one orbital index $n$ can cross levels from an adjacent index $n+1$.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established theory of nanoelectronics and condensed matter physics, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. The model for transport in graphene, including the Dirac Hamiltonian and Landauer-Büttiker framework, is standard in the field.\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts as requested: finding the mode-resolved transmission probabilities, deriving the general expression for the Fano factor, and evaluating its limiting value.\n\n### Part 1: Mode-Resolved Transmission Probabilities $T_n$\n\nWe begin with the two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian for massless fermions in graphene:\n$$ H = - i \\hbar v_{F} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} = - i \\hbar v_{F} (\\sigma_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\sigma_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}) $$\nwhere $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y)$ are the Pauli matrices. The eigenstates $\\Psi$ of this Hamiltonian satisfy the time-independent Dirac equation $H\\Psi = E\\Psi$.\n\nTo find the dispersion relation, we can operate with $H$ twice:\n$$ H^2 \\Psi = (-i \\hbar v_F)^2 (\\sigma_x \\partial_x + \\sigma_y \\partial_y)^2 \\Psi = -\\hbar^2 v_F^2 (\\partial_x^2 + \\partial_y^2) I \\Psi = -\\hbar^2 v_F^2 \\nabla^2 \\Psi $$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, and we have used the properties $\\sigma_x^2 = \\sigma_y^2 = I$ and $\\{\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y\\} = 0$. Since $H^2 \\Psi = E^2 \\Psi$, we have:\n$$ (-\\partial_x^2 - \\partial_y^2)\\Psi = \\left(\\frac{E}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)^2 \\Psi $$\nWe consider solutions that are plane waves in the transport direction $x$ and confined in the transverse direction $y$. A wavefunction for a given transverse mode $n$ can be written as $\\Psi_n(x,y) = \\phi_n(y) e^{i k_x x}$, where $\\phi_n(y)$ is the transverse mode profile. Substituting this into the equation above gives:\n$$ (k_x^2 - \\partial_y^2)\\phi_n(y) = \\left(\\frac{E}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)^2 \\phi_n(y) $$\nThe infinite-mass boundary conditions at $y=0$ and $y=W$ lead to quantization of the transverse momentum. The problem provides the resulting quantized transverse wave numbers:\n$$ q_n = \\frac{(n + 1/2)\\pi}{W} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots $$\nThese are the eigenvalues of the operator $-i\\partial_y$, such that $\\partial_y^2 \\phi_n(y) = -q_n^2 \\phi_n(y)$. The dispersion relation for the $n$-th mode is thus:\n$$ E_n(k_x) = \\pm \\hbar v_F \\sqrt{k_x^2 + q_n^2} $$\nThe problem requires evaluating transport at energy $E=0$, which corresponds to the Dirac point in undoped graphene. Setting $E=0$ in the dispersion relation yields:\n$$ 0 = \\hbar v_F \\sqrt{k_x^2 + q_n^2} \\implies k_x^2 = -q_n^2 $$\nSince $q_n$ is real and non-zero for all $n \\ge 0$, the longitudinal wave vector $k_x$ must be imaginary:\n$$ k_x = \\pm i q_n $$\nThis indicates that all modes at the Dirac point are evanescent, decaying or growing exponentially along the $x$-direction with a characteristic length $1/q_n$. The transport through the graphene strip of length $L$ is a process of quantum tunneling.\n\nFor a one-dimensional system described by the Dirac equation, the transmission through a region of length $L$ that supports only evanescent modes with decay constant $\\kappa$ is given by $T = \\text{sech}^2(\\kappa L)$. This result arises from the relativistic nature of the charge carriers, which suppresses back-reflection at the interfaces with the ideal contacts. Applying this to each independent transport channel (mode) in our graphene strip, the decay constant is $\\kappa_n = q_n$. Therefore, the mode-resolved transmission probability $T_n$ at energy $E=0$ is:\n$$ T_n = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(q_n L)} = \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{(n+1/2)\\pi L}{W}\\right) $$\n\n### Part 2: Fano Factor $F$ in terms of $\\{T_n\\}$\n\nThe Landauer-Büttiker formalism provides expressions for electrical current and shot noise. At zero temperature and for a small applied bias voltage $V$, the total electrical current $I$ is given by the Landauer formula for conductance $G$:\n$$ I = G V = \\left(\\frac{M e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n\\right) V $$\nwhere $M=4$ is the total degeneracy factor for graphene (2 for spin and 2 for valley), $e$ is the elementary charge, and $h$ is Planck's constant. The sum is over all transverse modes $n$.\n\nThe zero-frequency shot noise power spectral density $S_I$ at zero temperature is given by:\n$$ S_I = \\frac{2 M e^3 |V|}{h} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n(1-T_n) $$\nThis expression describes the partition noise arising from the probabilistic nature of electron transmission.\n\nThe Fano factor $F$ is defined as the ratio of the actual shot noise $S_I$ to the Poissonian noise value $2e|I|$ that would be expected for uncorrelated charge carriers:\n$$ F = \\frac{S_I}{2e|I|} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_I$ and $I$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{2 M e^3 |V|}{h} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n(1-T_n)}{2e \\left| \\left(\\frac{M e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n\\right) V \\right|} $$\nThe factors $2$, $M$, $e^3$, $|V|$, and $h$ cancel out, yielding the Fano factor in terms of the set of transmission probabilities $\\{T_n\\}$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n(1-T_n)}{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n - \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n^2}{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n^2}{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n} $$\n\n### Part 3: Limiting Value of $F$ in the Evanescent Transport Regime ($W \\gg L$)\n\nThe evanescent transport regime is defined by $W \\gg L$. In this limit, the aspect ratio $L/W$ is small. Consequently, the argument of the $\\text{sech}$ function in $T_n$, which is $(n+1/2)\\pi L/W$, is very small for a large number of modes. This means that many channels are nearly perfectly open ($T_n \\approx 1$).\n\nThe discrete sum over modes $n$ can be accurately approximated by an integral. Let $k_y = (n+1/2)\\pi/W$. The spacing between consecutive values of $k_y$ is $\\Delta k_y = \\pi/W$. As $W \\to \\infty$, this spacing becomes infinitesimal, and the sum $\\sum_n f(k_y)$ can be replaced by an integral $\\int f(k_y) \\frac{dn}{dk_y} dk_y$. Since $dn/dk_y = W/\\pi$, we have:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f(k_y) \\approx \\frac{W}{\\pi} \\int_{\\pi/(2W)}^\\infty f(k_y) dk_y \\approx \\frac{W}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^\\infty f(k_y) dk_y $$\nThe lower limit of the integral can be taken as $0$ because $\\pi/(2W) \\to 0$ in the limit $W \\gg L$.\n\nWe now evaluate the two sums required for the Fano factor using this integral approximation.\nFirst, the sum of transmissions $\\sum_n T_n$:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\text{sech}^2(k_y L) \\approx \\frac{W}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\text{sech}^2(k_y L) dk_y $$\nLet $u = k_y L$, so $dk_y = du/L$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\frac{W}{\\pi L} \\int_0^\\infty \\text{sech}^2(u) du = \\frac{W}{\\pi L} [\\tanh(u)]_0^\\infty = \\frac{W}{\\pi L} (1-0) = \\frac{W}{\\pi L} $$\nNext, the sum of squared transmissions $\\sum_n T_n^2$:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n^2 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\text{sech}^4(k_y L) \\approx \\frac{W}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\text{sech}^4(k_y L) dk_y $$\nUsing the same substitution $u = k_y L$:\n$$ \\frac{W}{\\pi L} \\int_0^\\infty \\text{sech}^4(u) du $$\nThis integral can be solved by recognizing that $\\text{sech}^2(u) = \\frac{d}{du}\\tanh(u)$:\n$$ \\int \\text{sech}^4(u) du = \\int \\text{sech}^2(u) (1-\\tanh^2(u)) du = \\int (1 - \\tanh^2(u)) d(\\tanh u) $$\nThis evaluates to $\\tanh(u) - \\frac{1}{3}\\tanh^3(u)$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\text{sech}^4(u) du = \\left[ \\tanh(u) - \\frac{1}{3}\\tanh^3(u) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - (0) = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nTherefore, the sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty T_n^2 \\approx \\frac{W}{\\pi L} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} $$\nFinally, we substitute these results into the expression for the Fano factor:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_n T_n^2}{\\sum_n T_n} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\frac{W}{\\pi L}}{\\frac{W}{\\pi L}} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThis gives the limiting value of the Fano factor.\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{3} $$",
