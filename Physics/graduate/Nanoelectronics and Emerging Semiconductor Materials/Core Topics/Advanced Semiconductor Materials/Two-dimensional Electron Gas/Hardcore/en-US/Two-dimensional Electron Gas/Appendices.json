For a single subband, the total density of states per unit area, $g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E)$, is defined as $\\frac{dN}{dE}$, where $N$ is the number of states per unit area.\n\nFrom the dispersion relation $E = E_i + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$, we can write $k^2 = \\frac{2m^*(E-E_i)}{\\hbar^2}$. Differentiating with respect to $E$ gives $2k \\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{2m^*}{\\hbar^2}$.\nThe number of states per unit area, $N(E)$, up to energy $E$ is:\n$$N(E) = g_s g_v \\int_0^{k(E)} \\frac{2\\pi k'}{ (2\\pi)^2} dk' = \\frac{g_s g_v}{4\\pi} k(E)^2 = \\frac{g_s g_v}{4\\pi} \\frac{2m^*(E-E_i)}{\\hbar^2}$$\nThe density of states per unit area is the derivative of $N(E)$ with respect to energy $E$:\n$$g_{2\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{dN(E)}{dE} = \\frac{g_s g_v m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$$\nThis is a constant, independent of energy, for $E \\ge E_i$, and zero otherwise, which is consistent with the problem statement.\nGiven $g_s=2$ and $g_v=1$, the DOS per subband is:\n$$g_{2\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} = \\frac{m^*}{\\pi\\hbar^2}$$\nThe total sheet density of electrons, $n_s$, is the sum of contributions from all occupied subbands:\n$$n_s(\\mu, T) = \\sum_i \\int_{E_i}^{\\infty} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} f(E, \\mu, T) \\, dE$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $T=0$, the onset of occupation of the second subband occurs when $\\mu$ crosses $E_2$, and the threshold sheet density is $n_{\\mathrm{th}} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} (E_2 - E_1)$.**\n\nAt absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(E,\\mu,0)$ is a step function: it is $1$ for $E  \\mu$ and $0$ for $E  \\mu$.\nThe second subband, which has states for $E \\ge E_2$, begins to be occupied precisely when the chemical potential $\\mu$ reaches the subband edge energy $E_2$. At this threshold, $\\mu = E_2$.\nThe total sheet density $n_s$ is the sum of densities in both subbands, $n_s = n_1 + n_2$.\nThe density in the second subband is:\n$$n_2 = \\int_{E_2}^{\\infty} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} f(E, \\mu=E_2, T=0) \\, dE = \\int_{E_2}^{E_2} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} \\, dE = 0$$\nThe density in the first subband is:\n$$n_1 = \\int_{E_1}^{\\infty} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} f(E, \\mu=E_2, T=0) \\, dE = \\int_{E_1}^{E_2} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} \\cdot 1 \\, dE = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} [E]_{E_1}^{E_2} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E_2-E_1)$$\nThe threshold sheet density is therefore $n_{\\mathrm{th}} = n_1 + n_2 = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E_2 - E_1)$.\nThe statement is entirely consistent with the principles of $T=0$ statistics for a 2DEG.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. For a multisubband 2DEG with constant two-dimensional density of states per subband, the total sheet density at finite temperature is $n_s = \\sum_i g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\, k_B T \\,\\ln\\!\\left( 1 + \\exp\\!\\left[(\\mu - E_i)/(k_B T)\\right] \\right)$.**\n\nWe need to calculate the carrier density in a single subband $i$ at finite temperature $T$.\n$$n_i = \\int_{E_i}^{\\infty} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} f(E, \\mu, T) \\, dE = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} \\int_{E_i}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\exp((E-\\mu)/k_B T) + 1} \\, dE$$\nLet $x = (E-\\mu)/(k_B T)$, so $dE = k_B T \\, dx$. The lower limit of integration becomes $x_i = (E_i - \\mu)/(k_B T)$.\n$$n_i = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} k_B T \\int_{x_i}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{e^x + 1} \\, dx$$\nThe antiderivative of $(e^x+1)^{-1}$ is $-\\ln(1+e^{-x})$.\n$$n_i = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} k_B T \\left[ -\\ln(1+e^{-x}) \\right]_{x_i}^{\\infty}$$\n$$n_i = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} k_B T \\left( \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (-\\ln(1+e^{-x})) - (-\\ln(1+e^{-x_i})) \\right)$$\n$$n_i = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} k_B T \\left( -\\ln(1) + \\ln(1+\\exp\\left[-\\frac{E_i-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right]) \\right)$$\n$$n_i = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} k_B T \\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[\\frac{\\mu-E_i}{k_B T}\\right]\\right)$$\nThe total sheet density $n_s$ is the sum over all subbands, $n_s = \\sum_i n_i$. Thus, the expression given in the option is correct. This is a standard result for 2D systems with parabolic bands.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**C. For GaAs with $m^* = 0.067\\, m_e$, $g_s=2$, $g_v=1$, and $E_2 - E_1 = 25\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, the zero-temperature threshold sheet density for the onset of second-subband occupation is approximately $7 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$.**\n\nFrom option A, the threshold density is $n_{\\mathrm{th}} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} (E_2 - E_1)$. First, we calculate the constant density of states $g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$ in SI units.\n$$g_{2\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{m^*}{\\pi\\hbar^2} = \\frac{0.067 \\times (9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})}{\\pi (1.055 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s})^2}$$\n$$g_{2\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{6.103 \\times 10^{-32}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{3.4967 \\times 10^{-68}\\,\\mathrm{J^2 s^2}} \\approx 1.745 \\times 10^{36}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2} J^{-1}}$$\nNext, we convert the energy separation to Joules.\n$$E_2 - E_1 = 25\\,\\mathrm{meV} = 25 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 4.005 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nNow, we calculate the threshold density $n_{\\mathrm{th}}$ in SI units ($\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$).\n$$n_{\\mathrm{th}} = (1.745 \\times 10^{36}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2} J^{-1}}) \\times (4.005 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\approx 6.989 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$$\nFinally, we convert the result to $\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $1\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = 10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$.\n$$n_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 6.989 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}} = 6.989 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$$\nThis value is approximately $7 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The option states a value of $7 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which is incorrect by a factor of $10$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. At any finite $T0$, the second subband remains completely unoccupied unless $\\mu  E_2 + k_B T$; thermal smearing does not produce any occupation for $\\mu  E_2$.**\n\nThe occupation of any electronic state with energy $E$ at temperature $T0$ is determined by the Fermi-Dirac function $f(E,\\mu,T)$, which is non-zero for any finite energy $E$. The \"tail\" of the distribution extends to arbitrarily high energies, although the occupation probability decreases exponentially.\nThe second subband contains states with energies $E \\ge E_2$. The occupation probability for a state at the bottom of this subband, $E=E_2$, is $f(E_2,\\mu,T) = [\\exp((E_2-\\mu)/k_B T) + 1]^{-1}$. For any finite $T0$ and finite $\\mu$, this probability is strictly greater than zero. Therefore, the second subband can never be \"completely unoccupied\".\nThe total number of electrons in the second subband, $n_2$, is given by the integral derived in option B:\n$$n_2 = g_{2\\mathrm{D}} k_B T \\ln\\left(1+\\exp\\left[\\frac{\\mu-E_2}{k_B T}\\right]\\right)$$\nFor any $T0$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$, so $n_2  0$. The statement that the subband is completely unoccupied is false. The very nature of thermal smearing is that it populates states above the chemical potential.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. At $T=0$, the derivative $\\mathrm{d} n_s / \\mathrm{d} \\mu$ exhibits a step increase by $g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$ when $\\mu$ passes $E_2$, while $n_s(\\mu)$ itself remains continuous across $\\mu = E_2$.**\n\nAt $T=0$, the sheet density $n_s$ is found by integrating the DOS up to the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n$$n_s(\\mu) = \\sum_i \\int_{E_i}^{\\mu} g_{2\\mathrm{D}} \\, dE \\cdot \\Theta(\\mu-E_i) = \\sum_i g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_i)\\Theta(\\mu-E_i)$$\nwhere $\\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. For the two-subband system:\n$$n_s(\\mu) = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_1)\\Theta(\\mu-E_1) + g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_2)\\Theta(\\mu-E_2)$$\nLet's check the continuity of $n_s(\\mu)$ at $\\mu=E_2$.\n- As $\\mu \\to E_2^{-}$ (from below), $n_s(\\mu) = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_1)$. The limit is $g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E_2-E_1)$.\n- As $\\mu \\to E_2^{+}$ (from above), $n_s(\\mu) = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_1) + g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_2)$. The limit is $g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E_2-E_1) + g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E_2-E_2) = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(E_2-E_1)$.\nSince the left and right limits are equal, $n_s(\\mu)$ is continuous at $\\mu=E_2$.\nNow, let's examine the derivative $\\mathrm{d} n_s / \\mathrm{d} \\mu$. This quantity is the total density of states at the Fermi level.\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} n_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\mu} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\mu} \\left[ g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_1)\\Theta(\\mu-E_1) \\right] + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\mu} \\left[ g_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu-E_2)\\Theta(\\mu-E_2) \\right]$$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} n_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\mu} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\Theta(\\mu-E_1) + g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\Theta(\\mu-E_2)$$\nThis shows that $\\mathrm{d}n_s/\\mathrm{d}\\mu$ is a staircase function.\n- For $E_1  \\mu  E_2$, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} n_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\mu} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\cdot 1 + g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\cdot 0 = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$.\n- For $\\mu  E_2$, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} n_s}{\\mathrm{d} \\mu} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\cdot 1 + g_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\cdot 1 = 2g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$.\nAs $\\mu$ passes through $E_2$, the derivative discontinuously jumps from $g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$ to $2g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$. The magnitude of this step increase is $2g_{2\\mathrm{D}} - g_{2\\mathrm{D}} = g_{2\\mathrm{D}}$.\nBoth clauses of the statement are correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**",

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement. The task is to compute the exchange-correlation induced change in the energy spacing between the first two subbands, $\\delta \\Delta E_{21}$, of a two-dimensional electron gas confined in an infinite quantum well. The calculation is to be performed within the Local Density Approximation (LDA) using first-order perturbation theory. The solution involves a series of computational steps for each set of given material and structural parameters. All calculations are performed in SI units, with the final result converted to electronvolts (eV).\n\nThe fundamental physical constants used in the calculation are the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$, the electron rest mass $m_e$, the elementary charge $e$, and the vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$.\n\nThe overall procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Parameter Initialization**: The input parameters for each case are the effective mass ratio $m^\\ast/m_e$, the relative dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_r$, the quantum well width $w$, and the total sheet density $n_s$. From these, we derive the effective mass $m^\\ast = (m^\\ast/m_e) m_e$ and other system-specific constants in SI units.\n\n2.  **Subband Structure and Density of States**: The non-interacting subband energies for an infinite quantum well of width $w$ are given by\n    $$ E_n^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n^2}{2 m^\\ast w^2} $$\n    for subband index $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The two-dimensional density of states, including spin degeneracy, is constant with energy and is given by\n    $$ g_{\\mathrm{2D}} = \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} $$\n\n3.  **Determination of Fermi Level and Subband Occupancies**: At zero temperature ($T=0$), all states up to the Fermi energy $E_F$ are occupied. The sheet density of an individual subband $n$ is $n_n = g_{\\mathrm{2D}} (E_F - E_n^{(0)})$ if $E_F  E_n^{(0)}$, and $0$ otherwise. The total sheet density $n_s$ is the sum of individual subband occupancies: $n_s = \\sum_n n_n$.\n    To find the number of occupied subbands, $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$, and the Fermi energy $E_F$, we can determine $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ by finding the integer $k$ for which the target density $n_s$ lies between the density required to populate the $k$-th subband and that required to populate the $(k+1)$-th subband. Let $n_s^{\\mathrm{crit}}(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} g_{\\mathrm{2D}}(E_k^{(0)} - E_i^{(0)})$ be the density at which $E_F$ is exactly equal to $E_k^{(0)}$. We find $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ such that $n_s^{\\mathrm{crit}}(N_{\\mathrm{occ}})  n_s \\le n_s^{\\mathrm{crit}}(N_{\\mathrm{occ}}+1)$.\n    Once $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ is known, $E_F$ is found by solving the linear equation:\n    $$ n_s = \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} g_{\\mathrm{2D}} (E_F - E_n^{(0)}) \\implies E_F = \\frac{n_s}{N_{\\mathrm{occ}} g_{\\mathrm{2D}}} + \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} E_n^{(0)} $$\n    The individual subband occupancies $n_n$ are then calculated for $n = 1, \\dots, N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$.\n\n4.  **Electron Density Profile**: The three-dimensional electron density $n(z)$ along the confinement direction $z \\in [0, w]$ is constructed by summing the contributions from all occupied subbands:\n    $$ n(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} n_n |\\psi_n(z)|^2 = \\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} n_n \\frac{2}{w} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n \\pi z}{w}\\right) $$\n    This density is computed on a fine, uniform grid of $z$ points for subsequent numerical calculations.\n\n5.  **Exchange-Correlation Potential**: The LDA potential $V_{\\mathrm{xc}}(z)$ is the sum of exchange $v_x(n(z))$ and correlation $v_c(n(z))$ components, evaluated at each point on the $z$ grid.\n    a.  **Exchange Potential**: The Dirac exchange potential is computed as:\n        $$ v_x(n) = - \\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r} n^{1/3} $$\n    b.  **Correlation Potential**: The Perdew-Zunger correlation potential requires translation into effective atomic units. The effective Bohr radius $a_B^\\ast$ and Hartree energy $E_H^\\ast$ are computed:\n        $$ a_B^\\ast = \\frac{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\hbar^2}{m^\\ast e^2} \\quad , \\quad E_H^\\ast = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^\\ast (a_B^\\ast)^2} $$\n        For a given density $n(z)$, the dimensionless Wigner-Seitz radius is $r_s(z) = \\left(\\frac{3}{4 \\pi n(z) (a_B^\\ast)^3}\\right)^{1/3}$. The potential $v_c(n)$ is then calculated using the provided piecewise parameterization for the correlation energy $\\varepsilon_c(r_s)$ and its derivative, which gives the dimensionless potential $v_c(r_s) = \\varepsilon_c(r_s) - \\frac{r_s}{3} \\frac{d\\varepsilon_c}{dr_s}$. The physical potential is $v_c(n) = v_c(r_s) E_H^\\ast$. At points where $n(z) = 0$, the potential $V_{\\mathrm{xc}}(z)$ is also $0$.\n\n6.  **Energy Correction Calculation**: The first-order perturbative energy shifts for the first ($n=1$) and second ($n=2$) subbands are calculated by numerically integrating:\n    $$ \\Delta E_n = \\int_0^w |\\psi_n(z)|^2 V_{\\mathrm{xc}}(z) \\, dz = \\int_0^w \\frac{2}{w} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n \\pi z}{w}\\right) V_{\\mathrm{xc}}(z) \\, dz $$\n    This integration is performed using Simpson's rule for high accuracy.\n\n7.  **Final Result**: The desired quantity is the change in the subband spacing, $\\delta \\Delta E_{21} = \\Delta E_2 - \\Delta E_1$. This result, calculated in Joules, is converted to electronvolts by dividing by the elementary charge $e$.\n\nThis systematic procedure is implemented in the following Python program to solve for each of the test cases provided.",
