It describes a realistic scenario in nanoimprint lithography that can be modeled using fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. All necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the applied pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, required to fill a trench of width $w$ and depth $h$ in a time $t$, and then to compute its value for specific parameters. The flow of the viscous resist is modeled as a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow in a channel.\n\nLet us set up a coordinate system. Let the $x$-axis be aligned with the trench depth, with the entrance at $x=0$ and the bottom of the trench at $x=h$. The trench width is along the $y$-axis, extending from $y=-w/2$ to $y=w/2$. The flow velocity is predominantly in the $x$-direction, $u_x$, and varies across the width, $u_x = u_x(y)$. The position of the moving resist front at time $t$ is denoted by $x(t)$.\n\nThe flow is governed by the steady, incompressible Stokes equation. For the given geometry and assumptions (lubrication-dominated flow, negligible inertia), the equation simplifies. The pressure $P$ varies only along the length of the filled portion of the trench, $x(t)$. The pressure gradient at any instant $t$ is approximated as being constant over the filled length $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\frac{P_{front} - P_{entrance}}{x(t)}\n$$\nThe pressure at the entrance is the applied pressure, $P_{entrance}$, and the pressure at the front is the ambient reference pressure, $P_{front}$. The applied pressure drop is $\\Delta P = P_{entrance} - P_{front}$. Thus, the pressure gradient is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{x(t)}\n$$\nThe $x$-component of the Stokes equation for this one-dimensional velocity profile $u_x(y)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\eta \\frac{d^2 u_x}{dy^2} = \\frac{dP}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{x(t)}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the resist viscosity.\n\nWe solve this second-order ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $u_x(y)$ by integrating twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_x}{dy} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\eta x(t)} y + C_1\n$$\n$$\nu_x(y) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions. Due to the symmetry of the flow profile about the centerline ($y=0$), the velocity gradient must be zero at $y=0$, which implies $C_1=0$. The no-slip boundary condition requires the velocity to be zero at the trench sidewalls, $u_x(\\pm w/2)=0$. Applying this to find $C_2$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{8\\eta x(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting the constants back, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$\nu_x(y) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left( \\frac{w^2}{4} - y^2 \\right)\n$$\nNext, we calculate the volumetric flow rate per unit out-of-plane length, $Q'$, by integrating the velocity profile across the trench width:\n$$\nQ' = \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} u_x(y) \\,dy = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} \\left( \\frac{w^2}{4} - y^2 \\right) \\,dy\n$$\n$$\nQ' = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left[ \\frac{w^2}{4}y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-w/2}^{w/2} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left( 2 \\left( \\frac{w^3}{8} - \\frac{w^3}{24} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left( \\frac{w^3}{6} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ' = \\frac{\\Delta P w^3}{12 \\eta x(t)}\n$$\nMass conservation at the advancing front relates the volumetric flow rate $Q'$ to the speed of the front, $v_f = dx/dt$. The volume filled per unit out-of-plane length in a time $dt$ is $dV' = Q' dt$. This volume is also equal to the area of the front ($w \\times 1$) moving a distance $dx$, so $dV' = w \\,dx$. Equating these gives:\n$$\nQ' = w \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for $Q'$ to obtain a differential equation for the front position $x(t)$:\n$$\nw \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta P w^3}{12 \\eta x(t)}\n$$\nAssuming the applied pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is constant during the filling process, we can separate variables:\n$$\nx \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta}\n$$\n$$\nx \\,dx = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta} \\,dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state ($t=0$, $x=0$) to the final state where the trench is completely filled ($t=t_{fill}$, $x=h$):\n$$\n\\int_0^h x \\,dx = \\int_0^{t_{fill}} \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta} \\,dt\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^h = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta} [t]_0^{t_{fill}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{h^2}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2 t_{fill}}{12 \\eta}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for the required pressure drop $\\Delta P$. Replacing $t_{fill}$ with the prescribed time $t$ from the problem statement:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{h^2}{2} \\frac{12 \\eta}{w^2 t} = \\frac{6 \\eta h^2}{w^2 t}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the applied pressure drop.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta P$ using the given parameters:\n$w=100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$h=100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\eta=500\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{6 (500\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) (1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{(1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 (0.1\\,\\mathrm{s})}\n$$\nThe terms $(1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out since $w=h$:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{6 \\times 500\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}}{0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{3000}{0.1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 30000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer in kilopascals (kPa).

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no discernible flaws and provides sufficient information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks: first, to derive the leading-order relationship between volumetric shrinkage $\\epsilon_v$ and linear shrinkage $\\epsilon_l$ under the assumption of isotropic contraction; second, to use this relationship to compute the final width of a line feature after polymerization.\n\nThe analysis begins within the framework of continuum kinematics. The material deformation is described by the deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$, which maps material points from an initial (reference) configuration to a final (deformed) configuration. The problem states that the contraction is isotropic, which implies that the deformation is uniform in all directions. This is characterized by a deformation gradient tensor of the form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a scalar known as the uniform principal stretch, and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. In a $3$-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, $\\mathbf{F}$ is represented by the matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe value of $\\lambda$ represents the ratio of a final length to its initial length in any direction. Since this is a contraction, we expect $\\lambda < 1$.\n\nThe local change in volume is given by the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor, $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$. For the given isotropic deformation, we have:\n$$\nJ = \\det(\\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = \\lambda^3 \\det(\\mathbf{I}) = \\lambda^3\n$$\nThe quantity $J$ also represents the ratio of the final volume $V$ to the initial volume $V_0$, i.e., $J = \\frac{V}{V_0}$. Thus, we have $\\frac{V}{V_0} = \\lambda^3$.\n\nThe volumetric shrinkage $\\epsilon_v$ is defined as $\\epsilon_v = \\frac{V_0 - V}{V_0}$. We can express this in terms of $J$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_v = 1 - \\frac{V}{V_0} = 1 - J\n$$\nSubstituting $J = \\lambda^3$, we obtain a relationship between volumetric shrinkage and the principal stretch:\n$$\n\\epsilon_v = 1 - \\lambda^3\n$$\n\nNext, we relate the linear shrinkage $\\epsilon_l$ to the principal stretch $\\lambda$. The linear shrinkage in any principal direction is defined as $\\epsilon_l = \\frac{L_0 - L}{L_0}$, where $L_0$ is an initial length and $L$ is the final length after contraction. The principal stretch is precisely the ratio of final to initial length, $\\lambda = \\frac{L}{L_0}$. Substituting this into the definition of $\\epsilon_l$ yields:\n$$\n\\epsilon_l = 1 - \\frac{L}{L_0} = 1 - \\lambda\n$$\nThis allows us to express the stretch $\\lambda$ in terms of the linear shrinkage:\n$$\n\\lambda = 1 - \\epsilon_l\n$$\n\nNow we derive the exact relationship between $\\epsilon_v$ and $\\epsilon_l$ by substituting the expression for $\\lambda$ into the equation for $\\epsilon_v$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_v = 1 - (1 - \\epsilon_l)^3\n$$\nThis equation is the exact relation for isotropic contraction.\n\nTo find the relationship to leading order in small strains, we assume that the linear strain is small, i.e., $\\epsilon_l \\ll 1$.

The leading-order term is the one with the lowest power of $\\epsilon_l$. Therefore, the leading-order relationship is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_v \\approx 3\\epsilon_l\n$$\n\nThis completes the first part of the problem.

We are asked to compute the final line width $w$ using the derived leading-order relation.\n\nFrom the derived relation, we can find the linear shrinkage $\\epsilon_l$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_l = \\frac{\\epsilon_v}{3}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $\\epsilon_v$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_l = \\frac{0.06}{3} = 0.02\n$$\nThe value $\\epsilon_l = 0.02$ is small compared to $1$, which provides justification for using the small-strain approximation.\n\nThe linear shrinkage for the line width is given by the definition:\n$$\n\\epsilon_l = \\frac{w_0 - w}{w_0}\n$$\nWe need to solve for the final width, $w$. Rearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_l w_0 = w_0 - w\n$$\n$$\nw = w_0 - \\epsilon_l w_0 = w_0 (1 - \\epsilon_l)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given initial width $w_0 = 28\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and the calculated linear shrinkage $\\epsilon_l = 0.02$:\n$$\nw = 28 \\times (1 - 0.02) = 28 \\times 0.98\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\nw = 27.44\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $27.44$ already has four significant figures.\nThus, the final line width after polymerization is $27.44\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.",
