Consider a single, long trench of rectangular cross-section in the stamp with width $w$ and depth $h$, with the out-of-plane trench length much larger than both $w$ and $h$ so that a two-dimensional approximation per unit out-of-plane length is appropriate. The resist at elevated temperature is incompressible, of constant viscosity $\\eta$, and obeys no-slip on solid boundaries.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a realistic scenario in nanoimprint lithography that can be modeled using fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. All necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the applied pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, required to fill a trench of width $w$ and depth $h$ in a time $t$, and then to compute its value for specific parameters. The flow of the viscous resist is modeled as a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow in a channel.\n\nLet us set up a coordinate system. Let the $x$-axis be aligned with the trench depth, with the entrance at $x=0$ and the bottom of the trench at $x=h$. The trench width is along the $y$-axis, extending from $y=-w/2$ to $y=w/2$. The flow velocity is predominantly in the $x$-direction, $u_x$, and varies across the width, $u_x = u_x(y)$. The position of the moving resist front at time $t$ is denoted by $x(t)$.\n\nThe flow is governed by the steady, incompressible Stokes equation. For the given geometry and assumptions (lubrication-dominated flow, negligible inertia), the equation simplifies. The pressure $P$ varies only along the length of the filled portion of the trench, $x(t)$. The pressure gradient at any instant $t$ is approximated as being constant over the filled length $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = \\frac{P_{front} - P_{entrance}}{x(t)}\n$$\nThe pressure at the entrance is the applied pressure, $P_{entrance}$, and the pressure at the front is the ambient reference pressure, $P_{front}$. The applied pressure drop is $\\Delta P = P_{entrance} - P_{front}$. Thus, the pressure gradient is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{x(t)}\n$$\nThe $x$-component of the Stokes equation for this one-dimensional velocity profile $u_x(y)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\eta \\frac{d^2 u_x}{dy^2} = \\frac{dP}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{x(t)}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the resist viscosity.\n\nWe solve this second-order ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $u_x(y)$ by integrating twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_x}{dy} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\eta x(t)} y + C_1\n$$\n$$\nu_x(y) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions. Due to the symmetry of the flow profile about the centerline ($y=0$), the velocity gradient must be zero at $y=0$, which implies $C_1=0$. The no-slip boundary condition requires the velocity to be zero at the trench sidewalls, $u_x(\\pm w/2)=0$. Applying this to find $C_2$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{8\\eta x(t)}\n$$\nSubstituting the constants back, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$\nu_x(y) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left( \\frac{w^2}{4} - y^2 \\right)\n$$\nNext, we calculate the volumetric flow rate per unit out-of-plane length, $Q'$, by integrating the velocity profile across the trench width:\n$$\nQ' = \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} u_x(y) \\,dy = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\int_{-w/2}^{w/2} \\left( \\frac{w^2}{4} - y^2 \\right) \\,dy\n$$\n$$\nQ' = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left[ \\frac{w^2}{4}y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-w/2}^{w/2} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left( 2 \\left( \\frac{w^3}{8} - \\frac{w^3}{24} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta x(t)} \\left( \\frac{w^3}{6} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ' = \\frac{\\Delta P w^3}{12 \\eta x(t)}\n$$\nMass conservation at the advancing front relates the volumetric flow rate $Q'$ to the speed of the front, $v_f = dx/dt$. The volume filled per unit out-of-plane length in a time $dt$ is $dV' = Q' dt$. This volume is also equal to the area of the front ($w \\times 1$) moving a distance $dx$, so $dV' = w \\,dx$. Equating these gives:\n$$\nQ' = w \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for $Q'$ to obtain a differential equation for the front position $x(t)$:\n$$\nw \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta P w^3}{12 \\eta x(t)}\n$$\nAssuming the applied pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is constant during the filling process, we can separate variables:\n$$\nx \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta}\n$$\n$$\nx \\,dx = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta} \\,dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state ($t=0$, $x=0$) to the final state where the trench is completely filled ($t=t_{fill}$, $x=h$):\n$$\n\\int_0^h x \\,dx = \\int_0^{t_{fill}} \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta} \\,dt\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^h = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2}{12 \\eta} [t]_0^{t_{fill}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{h^2}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta P w^2 t_{fill}}{12 \\eta}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for the required pressure drop $\\Delta P$.

Let the resist thickness be denoted by $h(t)$, and the substrate recession by $L_{s}(t)$.

Express your answer in minutes and round your final answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the shortest etch time, denoted as $t_{etch}$, that satisfies two distinct criteria in a nanoimprint lithography process. First, it must be long enough to completely remove a residual resist layer of a given initial thickness. Second, it must be short enough to ensure that the etching of the underlying substrate does not exceed a specified maximum loss.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Initial residual layer thickness: $h(0) = h_0 = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n-   Resist etch rate: $R = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}$\n-   Substrate etch rate: $R_s = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}$\n-   Maximum allowable substrate loss: $L_{\\max} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nWe shall formulate a mathematical constraint for each criterion.\n\nFirst, let us consider the condition for clearing the residual resist layer. The thickness of the resist, $h(t)$, decreases over time according to the rate equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = -R\n$$\nAssuming the etch rate $R$ is constant, we can integrate this equation with respect to time from $t=0$ to a final time $t_{etch}$. The initial condition is $h(0) = h_0$.\n$$\n\\int_{h_0}^{h(t_{etch})} dh = \\int_{0}^{t_{etch}} -R \\, dt\n$$\nThis integration yields the thickness of the resist at time $t_{etch}$:\n$$\nh(t_{etch}) - h_0 = -R \\cdot t_{etch}\n$$\nFor the residual layer to be completely cleared, its final thickness must be less than or equal to zero, i.e., $h(t_{etch}) \\le 0$. To find the shortest time that achieves this, we set the final thickness to be exactly zero, $h(t_{etch}) = 0$.\n$$\n0 - h_0 = -R \\cdot t_{etch}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{etch}$ gives the minimum time required to clear the resist:\n$$\nt_{etch} = \\frac{h_0}{R}\n$$\nTherefore, any valid process time must be greater than or equal to this value. This is our first constraint:\n$$\nt_{etch} \\ge \\frac{h_0}{R} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{50\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the constraint on the substrate loss. The substrate etches at a rate $R_s$ once exposed. The problem specifies a conservative assumption: \"any exposed substrate experiences the plasma for the full etch duration\". This simplifies the model by assuming the substrate loss, $L_s(t)$, is linearly proportional to the total etch time $t_{etch}$, starting from $t=0$. The rate of substrate recession is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dL_s}{dt} = R_s\n$$\nIntegrating this equation from $t=0$ to $t_{etch}$, with the initial condition $L_s(0) = 0$, gives the total substrate loss:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L_s(t_{etch})} dL_s = \\int_{0}^{t_{etch}} R_s \\, dt\n$$\n$$\nL_s(t_{etch}) = R_s \\cdot t_{etch}\n$$\nThe problem states that this loss must not exceed the maximum allowable value $L_{\\max}$:\n$$\nL_s(t_{etch}) \\le L_{\\max}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L_s(t_{etch})$ gives our second constraint on the etch time:\n$$\nR_s \\cdot t_{etch} \\le L_{\\max}\n$$\n$$\nt_{etch} \\le \\frac{L_{\\max}}{R_s} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{5\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\n\nTo satisfy both process requirements simultaneously, the etch time $t_{etch}$ must lie within the interval defined by these two constraints:\n$$\n\\frac{h_0}{R} \\le t_{etch} \\le \\frac{L_{\\max}}{R_s}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated numerical values:\n$$\n0.6\\,\\mathrm{min} \\le t_{etch} \\le 2.0\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nThe question asks for the shortest etch time that fulfills both conditions.
