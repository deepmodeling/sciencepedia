A direct current $I$ flows along the $x$-direction, and a uniform magnetic flux density $B$ is applied along the $z$-direction. The Hall voltage $V_H$ is measured across the width $w$ along the $y$-direction.

The setup is standard for a Hall measurement, and the material (a-IGZO) is a well-characterized semiconductor. All provided numerical values are physically realistic for a thin-film device. The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\n\n**Derivation of Transverse Electric Field and Hall Voltage**\n\nWe begin from first principles. The charge carriers are electrons, each with charge $-q$. The current $I$ flows in the $+x$-direction, which implies that the electron drift velocity, $\\vec{v}_d$, is in the $-x$-direction. We can write $\\vec{v}_d = -v_d \\hat{i}$, where $v_d$ is the positive drift speed. The magnetic field is given as $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe magnetic component of the Lorentz force, $\\vec{F}_B$, acting on an electron is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_B = (-q) (\\vec{v}_d \\times \\vec{B}) = (-q) ((-v_d \\hat{i}) \\times (B \\hat{k}))\n$$\nUsing the vector cross product rule $\\hat{i} \\times \\hat{k} = -\\hat{j}$, we get:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_B = (-q) (-v_d B) (\\hat{i} \\times \\hat{k}) = q v_d B (-\\hat{j}) = -q v_d B \\hat{j}\n$$\nThis magnetic force acts in the $-y$-direction, causing electrons to accumulate on one side of the channel (at $y=0$, for a channel defined from $y=0$ to $y=w$). This charge separation establishes a transverse electric field, the Hall field $\\vec{E}_H$, which points from the side with a net positive charge (electron-deficient) to the side with a net negative charge (electron-rich). Thus, $\\vec{E}_H$ points in the $-y$-direction. We can write it as $\\vec{E}_H = E_y \\hat{j}$, where $E_y$ is the magnitude of the field component, which will be negative.\n\nThis Hall field exerts an electric force, $\\vec{F}_E$, on the electrons:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_E = (-q) \\vec{E}_H = -q E_y \\hat{j}\n$$\nIn steady state, the transverse current is zero, which means the net transverse force on the charge carriers must be zero. The magnetic force is balanced by the electric force:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_B + \\vec{F}_E = 0\n$$\n$$\n-q v_d B \\hat{j} - q E_y \\hat{j} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the transverse electric field component, $E_y$:\n$$\nE_y = -v_d B\n$$\nNext, we relate the drift speed $v_d$ to the total current $I$. The current density vector $\\vec{J}$ is given by $\\vec{J} = n(-q)\\vec{v}_d$. Since $\\vec{v}_d = -v_d \\hat{i}$, the current density is $\\vec{J} = n(-q)(-v_d \\hat{i}) = n q v_d \\hat{i}$. The magnitude of the current density is $J_x = n q v_d$. The total current $I$ is the product of the current density and the cross-sectional area $A$ perpendicular to the current flow, where $A = w t$:\n$$\nI = J_x A = (n q v_d) (w t)\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the drift speed $v_d$ as:\n$$\nv_d = \\frac{I}{n q w t}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $v_d$ into the equation for $E_y$, we find the dependence of the transverse electric field:\n$$\nE_y = -\\left(\\frac{I}{n q w t}\\right) B = -\\frac{IB}{n q w t}\n$$\nThe Hall voltage $V_H$ is the potential difference across the width $w$. Using the standard definition $V_H = E_y w$, we get:\n$$\nV_H = \\left(-\\frac{IB}{n q w t}\\right) w = -\\frac{IB}{n q t}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that for $n$-type carriers, the Hall voltage is negative, which is consistent with the problem's stated convention.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of the Hall Voltage**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression for $V_H$. All values must be in SI units.\n-   $I = 1.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $B = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n-   $n = 6.00 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n-   $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $t = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$\nV_H = -\\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.30)}{(6.00 \\times 10^{23}) (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) (1.00 \\times 10^{-7})}\n$$\n$$\nV_H = -\\frac{3.60 \\times 10^{-4}}{9.612 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx -0.0374531835\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$\nV_H \\approx -0.03745\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Thickness Sensitivity**\n\nThe thickness sensitivity $S_t$ is defined as the logarithmic derivative:\n$$\nS_t \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln |V_H|}{\\partial \\ln t}\n$$\nFrom our derivation, the magnitude of the Hall voltage is:\n$$\n|V_H| = \\left| -\\frac{IB}{n q t} \\right| = \\frac{IB}{n q t}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln|V_H| = \\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{n q t}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{nq}\\right) - \\ln(t)\n$$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{nq}\\right)$ is a constant with respect to the thickness $t$. To find $S_t$, we differentiate $\\ln|V_H|$ with respect to $\\ln(t)$. Let $u = \\ln(t)$, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(t)}$.\n$$\nS_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(t)} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{nq}\\right) - \\ln(t) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_t = 0 - \\frac{\\partial(\\ln t)}{\\partial(\\ln t)} = -1\n$$\nThus, the thickness sensitivity $S_t$ is exactly $-1$. This dimensionless number indicates that a $1\\%$ increase in thickness results in a $1\\%$ decrease in the magnitude of the Hall voltage, a relationship of inverse proportionality.",

The sample is known to be close to compensation in the sense that electron and hole densities are comparable. Assume that charge transport is well described by a classical Drude-type response of electrons and holes, with scattering times independent of $B$.\n\nStarting from the force balance on a charge carrier in electric and magnetic fields and the definition of mobility, reason about how the concurrent presence of electrons and holes near compensation can produce simultaneously a small Hall voltage and a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance (defined as the relative change in longitudinal resistivity with $B$). Then, propose a measurement protocol that can separate the electron and hole contributions to transport and allow determination of the electron density $n$, hole density $p$, electron mobility $\\mu_n$, and hole mobility $\\mu_p$, under realistic experimental constraints typical of nanoelectronic devices.\n\nWhich of the following statements best capture the correct physical explanation and provide a valid measurement design to separate $n$ and $p$ contributions?\n\nA. In a nearly compensated semiconductor where $n \\approx p$, the transverse currents induced by the magnetic field for electrons and holes largely cancel, suppressing the Hall field, while the opposite cyclotron deflections of the two carrier types reduce the net longitudinal conductivity, yielding large magnetoresistance. To separate $n$ and $p$, measure both the longitudinal and transverse voltages versus $B$ over a wide range, construct the even-in-$B$ longitudinal response and the odd-in-$B$ Hall response by reversing $B$ to remove contact offsets, and perform a global fit of the resulting $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ and $\\rho_{xy}(B)$ to a two-carrier transport model to extract $n$, $p$, $\\mu_n$, and $\\mu_p$.\n\nB. The small Hall voltage is primarily caused by high contact resistance at the Hall probes, and the large magnetoresistance arises from weak localization. To deconvolve $n$ and $p$, use a Corbino disk geometry so that a Hall voltage can be measured without any longitudinal current.\n\nC. At compensation, the Hall voltage vanishes because the Lorentz force is zero, and the magnetoresistance grows because the effective mass increases strongly with magnetic field. To separate $n$ and $p$, measure only the zero-field resistivity as a function of temperature and use Matthiessen’s rule to ascribe the changes to electron and hole mobilities.\n\nD.

The magnetoresistance, defined as $\\left[\\rho_{xx}(B) - \\rho_{xx}(0)\\right]/\\rho_{xx}(0)$, is thus quadratic in $B$ at low fields.

Away from exact compensation, $\\sigma_{xy}$ is small but nonzero, yielding a small Hall voltage whose sign depends on the imbalance. This analysis explains how a compensated semiconductor can exhibit large magnetoresistance with a small Hall voltage.\n\nA realistic separation of electron and hole contributions requires careful measurement design:\n\n- One must remove spurious mixing of longitudinal and transverse signals caused by probe misalignment and contact asymmetry. This is achieved by reversing $B$ and constructing the odd-in-$B$ Hall response and the even-in-$B$ longitudinal response: $\\rho_{xy}(B) = \\left[V_{xy}(+B) - V_{xy}(-B)\\right]/\\left(2 I\\right)$ and $\\rho_{xx}(B) = \\left[V_{xx}(+B) + V_{xx}(-B)\\right]/\\left(2 I\\right)$ using a four-terminal measurement with current $I$.\n- With $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ and $\\rho_{xy}(B)$ obtained over a wide $B$-range, a global fit to the two-carrier Drude model yields $n$, $p$, $\\mu_n$, and $\\mu_p$. The wide-field leverage is crucial because the different $B$ scalings of $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{xy}$ for electrons and holes help break parameter degeneracies.\n- An alternative route that further breaks parameter degeneracy is to use an electrostatic gate. If the gate capacitance per unit area is $C_g$ and the thin film of thickness $t$ is sufficiently depleted or accumulated uniformly across its thickness by the gate field, then a gate voltage change $\\Delta V_g$ induces a known electron density change $\\Delta n \\approx C_g \\Delta V_g/(e t)$. If holes are not significantly modulated over the gate range, the gate serves as a controlled perturbation of $n$. Measuring the gate-induced change in the low-field Hall slope $d\\rho_{xy}/dB$ and the change in the zero-field resistivity $\\rho_{xx}(0)$ provides additional independent relationships among $n$, $p$, $\\mu_n$, and $\\mu_p$, which, combined with the field-dependent data and proper symmetrization/antisymmetrization, enable unique extraction of all four parameters. This strategy is compatible with Alternating Current (AC) lock-in detection to enhance signal-to-noise without altering the DC transport physics.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option correctly identifies the physical mechanism: in a compensated system, electron and hole transverse responses cancel, suppressing the Hall voltage, while the magnetic field diminishes longitudinal conductivity for both carrier types, producing large magnetoresistance. The measurement protocol described (wide-range $B$, construction of even and odd components by field reversal, and global fitting to a two-carrier model) is standard and effective for extracting $n$, $p$, $\\mu_n$, and $\\mu_p$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Attributing the small Hall voltage primarily to high contact resistance is incorrect; contact resistance can affect measured voltages but does not intrinsically suppress the odd-in-$B$ Hall response when proper four-terminal measurements and antisymmetrization are used. Weak localization can cause magnetoresistance at low $B$ and low temperature, but the described non-saturating, approximately quadratic magnetoresistance up to $10\\,\\mathrm{T}$ at $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is dominated by classical two-carrier physics, not quantum interference. Moreover, the Corbino disk geometry eliminates the Hall voltage by design; it measures longitudinal conductivity without a Hall contribution and therefore cannot be used to measure the Hall voltage or separate $n$ and $p$ via Hall data. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. The Lorentz force does not vanish at compensation; it acts on each carrier independently. Compensation reduces the net Hall voltage by cancellation of electron and hole contributions, not by eliminating the Lorentz force. The claim of effective mass increasing strongly with magnetic field as the cause of magnetoresistance is not part of the classical Drude mechanism here; in Drude, the mass is constant and the field dependence arises from cyclotron motion and the tensor nature of conductivity. Measuring only zero-field resistivity versus temperature and invoking Matthiessen’s rule cannot separately determine $n$, $p$, $\\mu_n$, and $\\mu_p$ in a two-carrier system without additional constraints. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. The proposed electrostatic gating strategy is sound under the stated thin-film conditions: a known $C_g$ provides a controlled perturbation $\\Delta n$ while $p$ remains approximately fixed over a limited gate range. By tracking changes in the low-field Hall slope and $\\rho_{xx}(0)$, and combining with field-dependent data after proper symmetrization/antisymmetrization, one can uniquely solve for $n$, $p$, $\\mu_n$, and $\\mu_p$ because the gate-induced shifts add independent constraints that break the parameter degeneracy inherent in fitting two-carrier transport from a single bias point. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. Illumination that creates balanced electron–hole pairs typically drives the system toward stronger compensation, which further suppresses the Hall voltage rather than increasing it linearly. The relationship between light intensity and Hall voltage in a two-carrier system is nontrivial and depends on recombination, mobilities, and carrier lifetimes; it does not directly yield $p$ without a model and additional measurements. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choices are A and D.",
