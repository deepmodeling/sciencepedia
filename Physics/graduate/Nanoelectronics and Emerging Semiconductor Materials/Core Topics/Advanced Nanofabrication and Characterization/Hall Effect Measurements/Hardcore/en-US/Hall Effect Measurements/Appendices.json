A direct current $I$ flows along the $x$-direction, and a uniform magnetic flux density $B$ is applied along the $z$-direction. The Hall voltage $V_H$ is measured across the width $w$ along the $y$-direction.

The setup is standard for a Hall measurement, and the material (a-IGZO) is a well-characterized semiconductor. All provided numerical values are physically realistic for a thin-film device. The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\n\n**Derivation of Transverse Electric Field and Hall Voltage**\n\nWe begin from first principles. The charge carriers are electrons, each with charge $-q$. The current $I$ flows in the $+x$-direction, which implies that the electron drift velocity, $\\vec{v}_d$, is in the $-x$-direction. We can write $\\vec{v}_d = -v_d \\hat{i}$, where $v_d$ is the positive drift speed. The magnetic field is given as $\\vec{B} = B \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe magnetic component of the Lorentz force, $\\vec{F}_B$, acting on an electron is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_B = (-q) (\\vec{v}_d \\times \\vec{B}) = (-q) ((-v_d \\hat{i}) \\times (B \\hat{k}))\n$$\nUsing the vector cross product rule $\\hat{i} \\times \\hat{k} = -\\hat{j}$, we get:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_B = (-q) (-v_d B) (\\hat{i} \\times \\hat{k}) = q v_d B (-\\hat{j}) = -q v_d B \\hat{j}\n$$\nThis magnetic force acts in the $-y$-direction, causing electrons to accumulate on one side of the channel (at $y=0$, for a channel defined from $y=0$ to $y=w$). This charge separation establishes a transverse electric field, the Hall field $\\vec{E}_H$, which points from the side with a net positive charge (electron-deficient) to the side with a net negative charge (electron-rich). Thus, $\\vec{E}_H$ points in the $-y$-direction. We can write it as $\\vec{E}_H = E_y \\hat{j}$, where $E_y$ is the magnitude of the field component, which will be negative.\n\nThis Hall field exerts an electric force, $\\vec{F}_E$, on the electrons:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_E = (-q) \\vec{E}_H = -q E_y \\hat{j}\n$$\nIn steady state, the transverse current is zero, which means the net transverse force on the charge carriers must be zero. The magnetic force is balanced by the electric force:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_B + \\vec{F}_E = 0\n$$\n$$\n-q v_d B \\hat{j} - q E_y \\hat{j} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the transverse electric field component, $E_y$:\n$$\nE_y = -v_d B\n$$\nNext, we relate the drift speed $v_d$ to the total current $I$. The current density vector $\\vec{J}$ is given by $\\vec{J} = n(-q)\\vec{v}_d$. Since $\\vec{v}_d = -v_d \\hat{i}$, the current density is $\\vec{J} = n(-q)(-v_d \\hat{i}) = n q v_d \\hat{i}$. The magnitude of the current density is $J_x = n q v_d$. The total current $I$ is the product of the current density and the cross-sectional area $A$ perpendicular to the current flow, where $A = w t$:\n$$\nI = J_x A = (n q v_d) (w t)\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the drift speed $v_d$ as:\n$$\nv_d = \\frac{I}{n q w t}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $v_d$ into the equation for $E_y$, we find the dependence of the transverse electric field:\n$$\nE_y = -\\left(\\frac{I}{n q w t}\\right) B = -\\frac{IB}{n q w t}\n$$\nThe Hall voltage $V_H$ is the potential difference across the width $w$. Using the standard definition $V_H = E_y w$, we get:\n$$\nV_H = \\left(-\\frac{IB}{n q w t}\\right) w = -\\frac{IB}{n q t}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that for $n$-type carriers, the Hall voltage is negative, which is consistent with the problem's stated convention.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of the Hall Voltage**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression for $V_H$. All values must be in SI units.\n-   $I = 1.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $B = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n-   $n = 6.00 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n-   $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $t = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$\nV_H = -\\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.30)}{(6.00 \\times 10^{23}) (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) (1.00 \\times 10^{-7})}\n$$\n$$\nV_H = -\\frac{3.60 \\times 10^{-4}}{9.612 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx -0.0374531835\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$\nV_H \\approx -0.03745\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Thickness Sensitivity**\n\nThe thickness sensitivity $S_t$ is defined as the logarithmic derivative:\n$$\nS_t \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln |V_H|}{\\partial \\ln t}\n$$\nFrom our derivation, the magnitude of the Hall voltage is:\n$$\n|V_H| = \\left| -\\frac{IB}{n q t} \\right| = \\frac{IB}{n q t}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln|V_H| = \\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{n q t}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{nq}\\right) - \\ln(t)\n$$\nThe term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{nq}\\right)$ is a constant with respect to the thickness $t$. To find $S_t$, we differentiate $\\ln|V_H|$ with respect to $\\ln(t)$. Let $u = \\ln(t)$, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(t)}$.\n$$\nS_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(t)} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{IB}{nq}\\right) - \\ln(t) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_t = 0 - \\frac{\\partial(\\ln t)}{\\partial(\\ln t)} = -1\n$$\nThus, the thickness sensitivity $S_t$ is exactly $-1$. This dimensionless number indicates that a $1\\%$ increase in thickness results in a $1\\%$ decrease in the magnitude of the Hall voltage, a relationship of inverse proportionality.",

The inverse of a generic $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor our resistivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$, the determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) = \\rho_{xx}(B) \\cdot \\rho_{xx}(B) - \\rho_{xy}(B) \\cdot (-\\rho_{xy}(B)) = \\rho_{xx}^2(B) + \\rho_{xy}^2(B)\n$$\nThe inverse tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, is then:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(B) = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{xx}^2(B) + \\rho_{xy}^2(B)} \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{xx}(B)  -\\rho_{xy}(B) \\\\ \\rho_{xy}(B)  \\rho_{xx}(B) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the general form of the conductivity tensor, we can identify its components:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(B) = \\frac{\\rho_{xx}(B)}{\\rho_{xx}^2(B) + \\rho_{xy}^2(B)}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(B) = \\frac{-\\rho_{xy}(B)}{\\rho_{xx}^2(B) + \\rho_{xy}^2(B)}\n$$\nThis derivation provides the required analytic mapping from the measured resistivity components to the conductivity components.\n\nNext, we use these expressions to compute the conductivity components at $B = 10\\,\\text{T}$ using the given measured values:\n$\\rho_{xx}(10\\,\\text{T}) = 3.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\rho_{xy}(10\\,\\text{T}) = 2.40 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\Omega\\,\\text{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the common denominator, $\\rho_{xx}^2 + \\rho_{xy}^2$:\n$$\n\\rho_{xx}^2 = (3.00 \\times 10^{-5})^2 = 9.00 \\times 10^{-10} \\, (\\Omega\\,\\text{m})^2\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{xy}^2 = (2.40 \\times 10^{-4})^2 = 5.76 \\times 10^{-8} \\, (\\Omega\\,\\text{m})^2\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{xx}^2 + \\rho_{xy}^2 = (9.00 \\times 10^{-10}) + (5.76 \\times 10^{-8}) = (0.09 \\times 10^{-8}) + (5.76 \\times 10^{-8}) = 5.85 \\times 10^{-8} \\, (\\Omega\\,\\text{m})^2\n$$\nNow we compute the conductivity components. The unit of conductivity is Siemens per meter ($\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$), which is equivalent to $(\\Omega\\,\\text{m})^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(10\\,\\text{T}) = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\,\\text{m}}{5.85 \\times 10^{-8} \\, (\\Omega\\,\\text{m})^2} = \\frac{3.00}{5.85} \\times 10^3\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} \\approx 512.8205\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(10\\,\\text{T}) = 512.8\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(10\\,\\text{T}) = \\frac{-2.40 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\Omega\\,\\text{m}}{5.85 \\times 10^{-8} \\, (\\Omega\\,\\text{m})^2} = \\frac{-2.40}{5.85} \\times 10^4\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} \\approx -4102.564\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(10\\,\\text{T}) = -4103\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we address the numerical stability and error propagation at large Hall angles. The Hall angle $\\theta_H$ is defined by $\\tan\\theta_H = \\sigma_{xy}/\\sigma_{xx}$. Using our derived relations:\n$$\n\\tan\\theta_H = \\frac{\\sigma_{xy}}{\\sigma_{xx}} = \\frac{-\\rho_{xy}/(\\rho_{xx}^2 + \\rho_{xy}^2)}{\\rho_{xx}/(\\rho_{xx}^2 + \\rho_{xy}^2)} = -\\frac{\\rho_{xy}}{\\rho_{xx}}\n$$\nA large Hall angle means $|\\tan\\theta_H| \\gg 1$, which implies $|\\rho_{xy}| \\gg \\rho_{xx}$. In our case, $|\\rho_{xy}|/\\rho_{xx} = (2.40 \\times 10^{-4})/(3.00 \\times 10^{-5}) = 8$, which is significantly greater than $1$. We are indeed in the large Hall angle regime.\n\nLet's examine the inversion formulas in this limit:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{-\\rho_{xy}}{\\rho_{xx}^2 + \\rho_{xy}^2} \\approx \\frac{-\\rho_{xy}}{\\rho_{xy}^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{xy}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{\\rho_{xx}}{\\rho_{xx}^2 + \\rho_{xy}^2} \\approx \\frac{\\rho_{xx}}{\\rho_{xy}^2}\n$$\nThe propagation of measurement uncertainties $\\delta\\rho_{xx}$ and $\\delta\\rho_{xy}$ to the conductivity components is analyzed through these approximate forms.\nFor $\\sigma_{xy}$, the relative uncertainty is $|\\frac{\\delta\\sigma_{xy}}{\\sigma_{xy}}| \\approx |\\frac{\\delta\\rho_{xy}}{\\rho_{xy}}|$. Since $\\rho_{xy}$ is the larger measured quantity, its relative measurement uncertainty is often small, making the calculation of $\\sigma_{xy}$ numerically stable and robust.\n\nFor $\\sigma_{xx}$, the situation is different. The relative uncertainty in $\\sigma_{xx}$ is given by propagation of error:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\sigma_{xx}}{\\sigma_{xx}}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\delta\\rho_{xx}}{\\rho_{xx}}\\right)^2 + \\left(-2\\frac{\\delta\\rho_{xy}}{\\rho_{xy}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\delta\\rho_{xx}}{\\rho_{xx}}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\rho_{xy}}{\\rho_{xy}}\\right)^2\n$$\nAt large Hall angles, $\\rho_{xx}$ is very small. Even if the absolute experimental uncertainty $\\delta\\rho_{xx}$ is small, the relative uncertainty $\\delta\\rho_{xx}/\\rho_{xx}$ can be very large. This large relative uncertainty in the small measured quantity $\\rho_{xx}$ propagates directly into a large relative uncertainty in the calculated diagonal conductivity $\\sigma_{xx}$. For instance, if a tiny portion of the large transverse voltage (related to $\\rho_{xy}$) is inadvertently measured as part of the longitudinal voltage (due to slight probe misalignment), this can introduce an error in $\\rho_{xx}$ that is a significant fraction of its true value. Consequently, extracting an accurate value for $\\sigma_{xx}$ from resistivity measurements is numerically challenging and potentially unstable in the large Hall angle limit, requiring extremely high-precision measurements of $\\rho_{xx}$.",
