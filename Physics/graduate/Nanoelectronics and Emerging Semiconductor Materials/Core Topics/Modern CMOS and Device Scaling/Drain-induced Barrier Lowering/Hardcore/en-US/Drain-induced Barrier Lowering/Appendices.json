            "problem": "A Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) or a short-channel transistor in an emerging semiconductor channel is measured to obtain two transfer characteristics, drain current versus gate voltage, $I_{d}(V_{g})$, at drain biases $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, under identical body bias and temperature. The goal is to extract Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) using the constant-current method. From first principles, in the subthreshold regime where transport is diffusion-dominated and the source-to-channel barrier height sets the current, the gate voltage controls the surface potential predominantly through the gate oxide capacitance while the drain can couple electrostatically into the channel and lower the source barrier. At a fixed subthreshold current, a change in $V_{d}$ that lowers the barrier must be compensated by a decrease in $V_{g}$ to keep the barrier height, and therefore $I_{d}$, constant.\n\nWhich choice below gives a scientifically rigorous and practically robust procedure to extract DIBL from the two $I_{d}(V_{g})$ curves using the constant-current method, and correctly justifies the choice of the reference current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the subthreshold regime?\n\nA. Select a reference current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ normalized to geometry (for example, per unit width $W$ or per active perimeter for multi-gate devices) that lies well within the diffusion-dominated subthreshold region where the semi-log $I_{d}$–$V_{g}$ curves at $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ are parallel (same subthreshold swing within experimental tolerance), above the noise floor and below regimes influenced by gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) or trap-assisted tunneling at high $V_{d}$. From each curve, read the gate voltages $V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}$ and $V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}$ at which $I_{d}=I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ for $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$, respectively. Compute DIBL as a positive quantity via $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left(V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}-V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}\\right)/\\left(1\\,\\mathrm{V}-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right)$ and report it in $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$, ensuring the same temperature and body bias are maintained. Justify $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in subthreshold so that the extraction reflects barrier control rather than series resistance, velocity saturation, or mobility effects present in strong inversion, and is not contact-limited (verified by geometry normalization and parallelism of semi-log slopes).\n\nB. Choose $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ at the peak transconductance region in strong inversion to maximize sensitivity, then for each $V_{d}$ linearly extrapolate $I_{d}$–$V_{g}$ to define a threshold voltage $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}/\\Delta V_{d}$. Strong inversion is preferred because the on-current is larger and thus has better signal-to-noise.\n\nC. At a fixed gate voltage $V_{g}$ in subthreshold, compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left[\\ln I_{d}(V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V})-\\ln I_{d}(V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV})\\right]/\\left(1\\,\\mathrm{V}-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right)$, and pick $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ as the minimum measurable current to avoid self-heating. This captures the drain-control of the barrier via the current ratio.\n\nD. Select $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the subthreshold regime as in A, but compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left(V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}-V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}\\right)/\\left(1\\,\\mathrm{V}-50\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\right)$ so that a lower threshold at higher $V_{d}$ yields a negative DIBL; report the signed value to distinguish barrier lowering from barrier raising.\n\nE. Choose $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ just below the onset of strong inversion to avoid GIDL, and compute $\\mathrm{DIBL}$ from the difference of subthreshold swing values between $V_{d}=1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{d}=50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ divided by $\\Delta V_{d}$, since DIBL primarily alters the slope of $\\log I_{d}$ versus $V_{g}$ in subthreshold.",
            "solution": "Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) is the phenomenon where the electrostatic potential from the drain terminal influences the channel potential near the source, effectively lowering the source-to-channel potential barrier. This leads to a reduction in the threshold voltage, $V_{th}$, as the drain-source voltage, $V_{ds}$, is increased. A simple linear model is often used to quantify this effect:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{th}}(V_{ds}) = V_{\\mathrm{th,0}} - \\lambda V_{ds} $$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{th,0}}$ is the threshold voltage at a very low $V_{ds}$ and $\\lambda$ is the DIBL parameter, typically expressed in units of $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$. By convention, $\\lambda$ is a positive quantity.\n\nThe constant-current method is a standard technique for extracting $\\lambda$. It is based on the physics of the subthreshold regime, where the drain current $I_d$ is dominated by diffusion and depends exponentially on the barrier height. The barrier height, in turn, is linearly controlled by the gate voltage $V_g$. An approximate expression for the subthreshold current is:\n$$ I_d \\propto \\exp\\left(\\frac{q(V_g - V_{th})}{n k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $n$ is the subthreshold slope factor (body-effect coefficient), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nTo keep the current $I_d$ constant at a chosen reference value $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, the term $(V_g - V_{th})$ must be kept constant, assuming $n$ does not change significantly with $V_d$.\nLet's consider two measurements at two different drain biases, a low bias $V_{d}^{\\mathrm{low}}$ (given as $50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and a high bias $V_{d}^{\\mathrm{high}}$ (given as $1\\,\\mathrm{V}$). Let the corresponding gate voltages required to achieve the current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ be $V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}$ and $V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}$, and the threshold voltages be $V_{th}^{\\mathrm{low}}$ and $V_{th}^{\\mathrm{high}}$.\nAt $I_d = I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, we have:\n$$ V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}) = V_g^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{high}}) $$\nRearranging this equation gives the change in threshold voltage:\n$$ \\Delta V_{th} = V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{high}}) - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}) = V_g^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} $$\nThe DIBL parameter $\\lambda$ is defined as the negative rate of change of $V_{th}$ with $V_d$:\n$$ \\lambda = -\\frac{\\Delta V_{th}}{\\Delta V_d} = - \\frac{V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{high}}) - V_{th}(V_d^{\\mathrm{low}})}{V_d^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta V_{th}$ from the constant-current condition:\n$$ \\lambda = - \\frac{V_g^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}}{V_d^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}} = \\frac{V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}}{V_d^{\\mathrm{high}} - V_d^{\\mathrm{low}}} $$\nSince an increase in $V_d$ lowers the barrier, a smaller $V_g$ is required to achieve the same current. Thus, $V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}  V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}$, which makes the numerator $(V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{high}})$ a positive quantity. This formulation correctly yields a positive DIBL parameter, consistent with convention.\nFor the specific values given:\n$$ \\mathrm{DIBL} = \\frac{V_g^{\\mathrm{low}} - V_g^{\\mathrm{high}}}{1\\,\\mathrm{V} - 50\\,\\mathrm{mV}} $$\n\nThe choice of the reference current $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is critical for the validity of the measurement.\n$1$. The method is derived from the subthreshold current equation, so $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ must be chosen in this regime, where a plot of $\\log(I_d)$ versus $V_g$ is linear.\n$2$. The current must be high enough to be well above the experimental noise floor and background leakage currents.\n$3$. The current must be low enough to be in the diffusion-dominated transport regime, away from strong inversion where drift current, series resistance, mobility degradation, and velocity saturation effects become prominent and confound the measurement.\n$4$. Parasitic leakage mechanisms that are exacerbated by high drain bias, such as Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL), must be avoided. GIDL occurs at low $V_g$ and high $V_d$, so $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ should be chosen at a gate voltage sufficiently above the GIDL onset region.\n$5$. Normalizing the current to the device width ($I_d/W$) is standard practice for comparing devices of different sizes, as it corresponds to a fixed current density.\n$6$. The method works best when the subthreshold swing (SS) is approximately the same at both drain biases, meaning the semi-log $I_d$-$V_g$ curves are parallel. This validates the assumption that $\\Delta V_g$ directly reflects $\\Delta V_{th}$.\n\nA. This option provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the constant-current method. It correctly specifies the choice of $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ in the appropriate region, considering all major practical issues (noise, GIDL, parallelism of curves). The formula $\\mathrm{DIBL}=\\left(V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}-V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}\\right)/\\Delta V_d$ is correct and follows convention by yielding a positive value. The justification for using the subthreshold regime is precise, correctly distinguishing barrier control from confounding strong-inversion effects.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. This option describes the linear extrapolation method (or $g_m$-max method), not the constant-current method. DIBL is fundamentally related to the barrier height controlling subthreshold conduction. While it does impact strong inversion, extracting it from this regime introduces significant errors from $V_d$-dependent effects like mobility degradation, velocity saturation, and series resistance, which are not directly part of the definition of DIBL. Maximizing signal-to-noise at the expense of introducing large, unaccounted-for systematic errors is scientifically unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. This is not the constant-current method, but a \"constant-gate-voltage\" or \"conductance\" method. The formula is dimensionally incorrect for DIBL; it yields a quantity with units of $\\mathrm{V}^{-1}$, whereas DIBL is a voltage shift per volt of drain bias (dimensionless, or $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$). The quantity calculated is $\\Delta(\\ln I_d) / \\Delta V_d$, which is related to $\\mathrm{DIBL}/(n k_B T/q)$, not DIBL itself. Additionally, choosing the minimum measurable current is risky as it is closest to the noise floor and potential leakage artifacts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. This option uses the correct methodology for selecting $I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, but the formula for DIBL is $\\left(V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}-V_{g}^{\\mathrm{low}}\\right)/\\Delta V_d$. As established, $V_{g}^{\\mathrm{high}}  V_g^{\\mathrm{low}}$, so this computation results in a negative value. While mathematically this represents the same physical effect, the universal convention in semiconductor physics is to define and report DIBL as a positive quantity (e.g., $80\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}$, not $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}$). The name \"Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering\" already specifies the direction of the effect. Using a non-standard sign convention is not \"practically robust\" as it can cause confusion. Option A uses the correct, standard convention.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nE. The premise of this option is fundamentally flawed. DIBL is a shift of the $I_d$-$V_g$ characteristic along the voltage axis, corresponding to a change in threshold voltage $V_{th}$. It does not primarily alter the slope, which is the subthreshold swing ($SS$). While short-channel effects can also cause $SS$ to depend on $V_d$, this is a separate effect from DIBL. The constant-current method for DIBL extraction is most accurate when the slopes are parallel (i.e., $SS$ is constant), not when their difference is measured. This option confuses two different short-channel effects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that presents a fully correct, rigorous, and conventionally standard procedure for extracting DIBL using the constant-current method.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities related to Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) in a short-channel MOSFET. First, the DIBL coefficient, and second, the corresponding change in barrier height.\n\n**1. Quantification of Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)**\n\nDIBL is a short-channel effect where the drain voltage affects the potential barrier between the source and the channel, thereby influencing the threshold voltage $V_T$. It is quantified as the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift per unit increase in drain-to-source voltage $V_D$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} = -\\frac{dV_T}{dV_D}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the threshold voltage typically decreases as the drain voltage increases.\n\nIn this problem, the threshold voltage is determined by the constant-current method, where $V_T$ is defined as the gate voltage $V_G$ at which the drain current per unit width reaches a specific value $I_D^*$. The problem provides two such points:\n- At $V_{D,1} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the threshold voltage is $V_{T,1} = V_{G,1} = 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- At $V_{D,2} = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the threshold voltage is $V_{T,2} = V_{G,2} = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nWe can approximate the derivative with a finite difference calculation using the two given data points:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta V_T}{\\Delta V_D} = -\\frac{V_{T,2} - V_{T,1}}{V_{D,2} - V_{D,1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T = V_{G,2} - V_{G,1} = 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V} = -0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_D = V_{D,2} - V_{D,1} = 1.000\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.950\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the DIBL value:\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} = -\\frac{-0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.950\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.118}{0.950}\\,\\mathrm{V/V} \\approx 0.12421\\,\\mathrm{V/V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\n\\text{DIBL} \\approx 0.12421\\,\\mathrm{V/V} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{1\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 124.21\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $124\\,\\mathrm{mV/V}$.\n\n**2. Estimation of Barrier Height Decrease**\n\nIn the subthreshold region of a MOSFET, the drain current is controlled by the rate of thermionic emission of electrons over the potential energy barrier between the source and the channel. The current is exponentially dependent on the height of this barrier, $\\phi_B$: $I_D \\propto \\exp(-q\\phi_B / (k_B T))$.\n\nThe condition of constant current ($I_D = I_D^*$) implies that the net barrier height $\\phi_B$ is the same for both measurement conditions. The barrier height is modulated by both the gate voltage $V_G$ and the drain voltage $V_D$. An increase in $V_D$ from $V_{D,1}$ to $V_{D,2}$ causes a lowering of the barrier, which would increase the current. To counteract this and maintain a constant current, the gate voltage is reduced from $V_{G,1}$ to $V_{G,2}$. This reduction in $V_G$ raises the barrier.\n\nThe magnitude of the barrier lowering caused by the change in drain voltage must be equal to the magnitude of the barrier raising caused by the compensatory change in gate voltage. The problem specifically instructs us to interpret the barrier height decrease as \"the change in electron energy associated with the observed gate-voltage reduction\".\n\nThe observed gate-voltage reduction is:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_G| = V_{G,1} - V_{G,2} = 0.410\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.292\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe change in potential energy, $\\Delta E$, for a particle with charge $q$ moving through a potential difference $\\Delta V$ is $\\Delta E = q\\Delta V$. For an electron, the charge is $q = -e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. A reduction in gate voltage from $V_{G,1}$ to $V_{G,2}$ (a potential change of $\\Delta V_G = V_{G,2} - V_{G,1} = -0.118\\,\\mathrm{V}$) causes an increase in the potential energy barrier for an electron.\n\nThe magnitude of this energy change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_B| = |(-e)(\\Delta V_G)| = e \\cdot |V_{G,2} - V_{G,1}| = e \\cdot (0.118\\,\\mathrm{V})\n$$\nWhen an energy change is expressed in units of electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), its numerical value is equal to the magnitude of the potential difference in volts through which the elementary charge moves. Therefore, the magnitude of the barrier energy change is:\n$$\n|\\Delta E_B| = 0.118\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis value represents the magnitude of the barrier raising due to the gate voltage reduction, which, by the principle of compensation, must be equal to the magnitude of the barrier lowering induced by the increase in drain voltage. So, the decrease in the source-channel barrier height is $0.118\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This result is already given to three significant figures.",
