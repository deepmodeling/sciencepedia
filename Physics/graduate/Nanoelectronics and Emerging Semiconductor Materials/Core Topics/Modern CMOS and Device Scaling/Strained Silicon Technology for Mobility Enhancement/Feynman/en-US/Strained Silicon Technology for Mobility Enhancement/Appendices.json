            "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and validated against the required criteria of scientific soundness, objectivity, and completeness. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiclassical carrier transport in semiconductors, a standard and well-established topic in solid-state physics and nanoelectronics. The scenario of mobility enhancement in strained silicon is a canonical example used in the field. The given parameters—a $15\\%$ decrease in conductivity effective mass and a $20\\%$ increase in momentum relaxation time—are physically plausible for biaxial tensile strain. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear definition of the quantity to be calculated. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution is warranted.\n\nWe begin from the first principles of the semiclassical model of electron transport, often referred to as the Drude model, which is a simplified consequence of the Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. The equation of motion for the average momentum $\\vec{p}$ of an electron in an electric field $\\vec{E}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = -e\\vec{E} - \\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\tau}\n$$\nHere, $-e\\vec{E}$ represents the force exerted by the electric field on the electron (with elementary charge $e$), and the term $-\\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\tau}$ is a phenomenological representation of momentum loss due to scattering events, where $\\tau$ is the average momentum relaxation time.\n\nIn the steady-state condition for low-field drift, the average momentum is constant, so $\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = 0$. This yields:\n$$\n0 = -e\\vec{E} - \\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\tau}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state momentum gives:\n$$\n\\vec{p} = -e\\tau\\vec{E}\n$$\nThe drift velocity $\\vec{v}_d$ of the charge carriers is related to their momentum through the conductivity effective mass, $m_c^*$, by the relation $\\vec{p} = m_c^* \\vec{v}_d$. Substituting this into the momentum expression, we find:\n$$\nm_c^* \\vec{v}_d = -e\\tau\\vec{E}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the drift velocity as:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_d = -\\left(\\frac{e\\tau}{m_c^*}\\right)\\vec{E}\n$$\nThe drift mobility, $\\mu$, is defined as the magnitude of the proportionality constant relating the drift velocity to the electric field, i.e., $\\vec{v}_d = -\\mu\\vec{E}$. By comparing the two preceding expressions for $\\vec{v}_d$, we identify the mobility as:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{e\\tau}{m_c^*}\n$$\nThis fundamental expression connects the macroscopic transport property, mobility, to the microscopic parameters of the material: the momentum relaxation time $\\tau$ and the conductivity effective mass $m_c^*$. The elementary charge $e$ is a fundamental constant.\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional mobility enhancement, which we denote as $\\eta$. This is defined as:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{strained}} - \\mu_{\\text{unstrained}}}{\\mu_{\\text{unstrained}}}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this expression as:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{strained}}}{\\mu_{\\text{unstrained}}} - 1\n$$\nUsing our derived formula for mobility, we can write the expressions for the mobility in the strained and unstrained states, denoted by the subscripts 'strained' and 'unstrained', respectively:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{strained}} = \\frac{e\\tau_{\\text{strained}}}{m_{c, \\text{strained}}^*} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_{\\text{unstrained}} = \\frac{e\\tau_{\\text{unstrained}}}{m_{c, \\text{unstrained}}^*}\n$$\nNow, we form the ratio $\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{strained}}}{\\mu_{\\text{unstrained}}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{strained}}}{\\mu_{\\text{unstrained}}} = \\frac{\\frac{e\\tau_{\\text{strained}}}{m_{c, \\text{strained}}^* }}{\\frac{e\\tau_{\\text{unstrained}}}{m_{c, \\text{unstrained}}^*} } = \\left(\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{strained}}}{\\tau_{\\text{unstrained}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m_{c, \\text{unstrained}}^*}{m_{c, \\text{strained}}^*}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\eta$, we obtain the general formula for the fractional mobility enhancement in terms of the changes in the microscopic parameters:\n$$\n\\eta = \\left(\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{strained}}}{\\tau_{\\text{unstrained}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m_{c, \\text{unstrained}}^*}{m_{c, \\text{strained}}^*}\\right) - 1\n$$\nThe problem provides the specific changes for these parameters due to strain.

Thus, $\\phi_{s,inv} = 2\\phi_F$. The expression for $V_T$ becomes:\n$$V_T = V_{FB} + 2\\phi_F + V_{depletion}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the change in threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_T$, resulting from the strain.

Therefore, to leading order, the shift in threshold voltage is:\n$$\\Delta V_T = \\Delta V_{FB} + 2\\Delta\\phi_F$$\n\nNext, we analyze the change in the flat-band voltage, $\\Delta V_{FB}$. The flat-band voltage is defined by the difference in work functions between the gate metal ($\\Phi_M$) and the semiconductor ($\\Phi_S$), adjusted for any fixed charges in the oxide ($Q_f$):\n$$V_{FB} = \\frac{\\Phi_M - \\Phi_S}{q} - \\frac{Q_f}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe problem specifies negligible changes in oxide fixed charge, so $\\Delta Q_f = 0$. The gate metal work function $\\Phi_M$ is also constant. Therefore, any change in $V_{FB}$ must come from a change in the semiconductor work function $\\Phi_S$.\n\nThe work function of the $p$-type semiconductor, $\\Phi_S$, is the energy difference between the vacuum level, $E_{vac}$, and the Fermi level, $E_F$:\n$$\\Phi_S = E_{vac} - E_F$$\nThe position of the Fermi level $E_F$ in a uniformly doped semiconductor is determined by the doping concentration, temperature, and band structure. For a $p$-type semiconductor, the hole concentration $p_0$ is equal to the acceptor concentration $N_A$ (assuming full ionization). $p_0$ is given by:\n$$p_0 = N_A = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_v$ is the effective density of states in the valence band and $E_v$ is the valence band edge energy. The problem states that the valence band edge remains unchanged, so $E_v$ is constant. For a leading-order approximation, we assume the strain-induced change in the effective mass, and thus in $N_v$, is a higher-order effect and can be neglected. Since $N_A$, $T$, and $k_B$ are also constant, the energy difference $E_F - E_v$ must remain constant for the equation to hold. Because $E_v$ is constant, the Fermi level $E_F$ must also be constant.\nSince $E_{vac}$ is a fixed energy reference and $E_F$ is constant, the semiconductor work function $\\Phi_S$ does not change.

The strain induces a shift $\\Delta E_c$ in the conduction band, while the valence band remains unchanged ($\\Delta E_v = 0$). The new bandgap $E_g'$ is:\n$$E_g' = E_c' - E_v' = (E_c + \\Delta E_c) - E_v = (E_c - E_v) + \\Delta E_c = E_g + \\Delta E_c$$\nThe change in the bandgap is therefore $\\Delta E_g = \\Delta E_c$.\n\nAssuming the effective densities of states $N_c$ and $N_v$ do not change to leading order, the ratio of the intrinsic carrier concentrations is:\n$$\\frac{n_i}{n_i'} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_c N_v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)}{\\sqrt{N_c N_v} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g'}{2k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_g' - E_g}{2k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting this ratio back into the expression for $\\Delta\\phi_F$:\n$$\\Delta\\phi_F = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta E_g}{2q}$$\nSince $\\Delta E_g = \\Delta E_c$, we have:\n$$\\Delta\\phi_F = \\frac{\\Delta E_c}{2q}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into our expression for $\\Delta V_T$:\n$$\\Delta V_T = 2\\Delta\\phi_F = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_c}{2q}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta E_c}{q}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the leading-order shift in the threshold voltage.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value.
