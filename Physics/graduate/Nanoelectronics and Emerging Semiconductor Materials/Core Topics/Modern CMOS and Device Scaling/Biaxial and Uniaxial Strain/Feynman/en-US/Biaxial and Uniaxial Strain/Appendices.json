            "problem": "A thin epitaxial semiconductor film of thickness $t$ is grown coherently on a semi-infinite substrate. The film is laterally extended in the $x$-$y$ plane and has a free surface at $z=t$, with the interface at $z=0$. Assume linear elasticity and small strains. Consider two elasticity cases for the film: (i) mechanically isotropic, characterized by Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, and (ii) elastically anisotropic with cubic symmetry, oriented such that the crystallographic $(001)$ plane coincides with the film surface, and the in-plane axes are $[100]$ and $[010]$. Let the cubic elastic stiffness tensor in Voigt notation be defined by $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, and $c_{44}$, and the corresponding elastic compliance tensor by $s_{11}$, $s_{12}$, and $s_{44}$.\n\nSuppose the film experiences an equi-biaxial in-plane state due to lattice mismatch, with $\\sigma_{x}=\\sigma_{y}=\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon_{x}=\\epsilon_{y}=\\epsilon$, and the out-of-plane surface is traction-free.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elasticity and continuum mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information to determine a unique solution, and framed using objective, formal language. The scenario described—an epitaxial thin film under biaxial strain—is a standard and physically realistic problem in materials science and semiconductor device physics.\n\nThe task is to derive the effective biaxial modulus $M$ for two cases of a thin film under an equi-biaxial plane-stress state, defined by $\\sigma_{x}=\\sigma_{y}=\\sigma$, $\\epsilon_{x}=\\epsilon_{y}=\\epsilon$, and $M=\\sigma/\\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, we justify the plane-stress assumption, where all stress components involving the out-of-plane $z$-direction are zero or negligible. The film is thin, with thickness $t$, and has a traction-free surface at $z=t$. The traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ on a surface with normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is given by $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. For the free surface at $z=t$, the normal vector is $\\mathbf{n} = (0, 0, 1)$. The traction-free condition $\\mathbf{t}=\\mathbf{0}$ implies:\n$$ \\sigma_{zx} = 0, \\quad \\sigma_{zy} = 0, \\quad \\sigma_{zz} = 0 \\quad \\text{at } z=t $$\nIn the absence of body forces, the equations of mechanical equilibrium are $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 0$, which in component form are $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = 0$ (using summation convention). The relevant equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yx}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zy}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yz}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nFor a film grown coherently on a large substrate, it is reasonable to assume that the stress and strain fields are uniform in the lateral ($x, y$) directions, meaning derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ vanish. The equilibrium equations simplify to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial z} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zy}}{\\partial z} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nThese equations imply that $\\sigma_{zx}$, $\\sigma_{zy}$, and $\\sigma_{zz}$ are constant throughout the film thickness. Since they are zero at the free surface $z=t$, they must be zero everywhere within the film. Therefore, $\\sigma_{zx} = \\sigma_{zy} = \\sigma_{zz} = 0$. For the equi-biaxial state in the specified material symmetries (isotropic and (001) cubic), the in-plane shear stresses are also zero, $\\sigma_{xy}=0$. This establishes the state of plane stress, $\\sigma_z = \\sigma_{zx} = \\sigma_{zy} = 0$.\n\n1. Effective biaxial modulus $M$ for the isotropic film.\n\nWe begin with the generalized Hooke's law for an isotropic material, expressing strains in terms of stresses:\n$$ \\epsilon_{x} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{x} - \\nu (\\sigma_{y} + \\sigma_{z}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{y} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{y} - \\nu (\\sigma_{x} + \\sigma_{z}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{z} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{z} - \\nu (\\sigma_{x} + \\sigma_{y}) ] $$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\nWe apply the conditions for the equi-biaxial plane-stress state:\n- Plane stress: $\\sigma_{z} = 0$.\n- Equi-biaxial stress: $\\sigma_{x} = \\sigma_{y} = \\sigma$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\epsilon_x$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{x} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma - \\nu (\\sigma + 0) ] = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} (1-\\nu) $$\nSimilarly for $\\epsilon_y$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{y} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma - \\nu (\\sigma + 0) ] = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} (1-\\nu) $$\nThis confirms that the in-plane strains are equal, $\\epsilon_x = \\epsilon_y$, which we denote as $\\epsilon$.\nThe problem defines the effective biaxial modulus as $M = \\sigma / \\epsilon$. From the derived relation $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} (1-\\nu)$, we can write the ratio:\n$$ M = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\frac{\\sigma}{E} (1-\\nu)} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu} $$\n\n2. Effective biaxial modulus $M$ for the cubic (001) film.\n\nFor an anisotropic material, it is often more direct to work with the stiffness formulation of Hooke's law, expressing stresses in terms of strains. For a cubic crystal with axes aligned with the coordinates ($x \\leftrightarrow [100], y \\leftrightarrow [010], z \\leftrightarrow [001]$), the constitutive relations are:\n$$ \\sigma_{x} = c_{11}\\epsilon_{x} + c_{12}\\epsilon_{y} + c_{12}\\epsilon_{z} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y} = c_{12}\\epsilon_{x} + c_{11}\\epsilon_{y} + c_{12}\\epsilon_{z} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{z} = c_{12}\\epsilon_{x} + c_{12}\\epsilon_{y} + c_{11}\\epsilon_{z} $$\nwhere $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, and $c_{44}$ are the independent elastic stiffness constants in Voigt notation.\nWe apply the given conditions:\n- Plane stress: $\\sigma_{z} = 0$.\n- Equi-biaxial strain: $\\epsilon_{x} = \\epsilon_{y} = \\epsilon$.\n\nUsing the third equation for $\\sigma_{z}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{z} = 0 = c_{12}\\epsilon + c_{12}\\epsilon + c_{11}\\epsilon_{z} $$\n$$ 0 = 2c_{12}\\epsilon + c_{11}\\epsilon_{z} $$\nFrom this, we solve for the out-of-plane strain $\\epsilon_z$ in terms of the in-plane strain $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{z} = -\\frac{2c_{12}}{c_{11}}\\epsilon $$\nThis relation describes the Poisson effect for this specific loading condition and material symmetry. Now, we substitute this expression for $\\epsilon_z$ into the equation for $\\sigma_x$. The problem specifies an equi-biaxial stress state $\\sigma_x = \\sigma_y = \\sigma$.\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_{x} = c_{11}\\epsilon_{x} + c_{12}\\epsilon_{y} + c_{12}\\epsilon_{z} $$\nSubstituting $\\epsilon_{x} = \\epsilon$, $\\epsilon_{y} = \\epsilon$, and the derived expression for $\\epsilon_z$:\n$$ \\sigma = c_{11}\\epsilon + c_{12}\\epsilon + c_{12} \\left(-\\frac{2c_{12}}{c_{11}}\\epsilon\\right) $$\nFactoring out $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\left( c_{11} + c_{12} - \\frac{2c_{12}^2}{c_{11}} \\right) \\epsilon $$\nThe effective biaxial modulus is $M = \\sigma / \\epsilon$. Therefore, we obtain:\n$$ M = c_{11} + c_{12} - \\frac{2c_{12}^2}{c_{11}} $$\nThis expression gives the biaxial modulus for a (001)-oriented cubic film under plane stress, solely in terms of the stiffness constants $c_{11}$ and $c_{12}$, as required.\n\nThe final answers for the two cases are thus derived.",

The negative sign indicates that the out-of-plane ($z$) valleys are lowered in energy relative to the in-plane ($x$, $y$) valleys.\n\n(c) We are asked to compute the ratio of electron populations $R = N_{\\text{out}}/N_{\\text{in}}$ under the biaxial $(001)$ strain at $T=300\\,\\text{K}$.\n$N_{\\text{out}}$ is the population in the two out-of-plane valleys ($\\pm[001]$), which share the energy shift $\\Delta E_z$.\n$N_{\\text{in}}$ is the population in the four in-plane valleys ($\\pm[100], \\pm[010]$), which share the energy shift $\\Delta E_x = \\Delta E_y$.\nUnder nondegenerate statistics, the population of a single valley is proportional to $\\exp(-\\Delta E/k_{B}T)$. Assuming the same density-of-states for each valley, we have:\n$$\nN_{\\text{out}} \\propto 2 \\exp(-\\Delta E_z / k_{B}T) \\\\\nN_{\\text{in}} \\propto 4 \\exp(-\\Delta E_x / k_{B}T)\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$\nR = \\frac{N_{\\text{out}}}{N_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{2 \\exp(-\\Delta E_z / k_{B}T)}{4 \\exp(-\\Delta E_x / k_{B}T)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_z - \\Delta E_x}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$:\n$$\nk_B T = (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV/K}) (300\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 0.025852\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nNow we compute the exponent:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\Delta E_z - \\Delta E_x}{k_B T} = -\\frac{-0.08112432\\,\\text{eV}}{0.025852\\,\\text{eV}} \\approx 3.138006\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(3.138006) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\times 23.05608 \\approx 11.52804\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, gives $R=11.53$.\nThis high ratio indicates a significant repopulation of electrons from the higher-energy in-plane valleys to the lower-energy out-of-plane valleys due to the strain-induced splitting.",
