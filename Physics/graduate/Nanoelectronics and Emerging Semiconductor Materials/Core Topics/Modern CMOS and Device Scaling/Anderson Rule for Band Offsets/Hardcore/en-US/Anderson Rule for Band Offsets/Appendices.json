The conduction band minimum ($E_c$) and valence band maximum ($E_v$) are related by the bandgap, $E_g$, such that $E_c = E_v + E_g$. The conduction band offset is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c} = E_{c}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}} - E_{c}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = \\left(E_{v}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}} + E_{g}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}}\\right) - \\left(E_{v}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + E_{g}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c} = \\left(E_{v}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}} - E_{v}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}}\\right) + \\left(E_{g}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}} - E_{g}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}}\\right) = \\Delta E_{v} + \\Delta E_{g}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the difference in bandgaps, $\\Delta E_{g}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{g} = E_{g}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}} - E_{g}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = 2.16\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 1.42\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.74\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nNow, compute the XPS-inferred conduction band offset, $\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}} = \\Delta E_{v}^{\\mathrm{XPS}} + \\Delta E_{g} = -0.60\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 0.74\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.14\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Conduction Band Offset via Anderson's Rule**\n\nAnderson’s rule posits that when two semiconductors form a heterojunction, their vacuum energy levels ($E_{vac}$) align. The electron affinity, $\\chi$, is the energy required to move an electron from the conduction band minimum ($E_c$) to the vacuum level, i.e., $\\chi = E_{vac} - E_c$.\nThis implies $E_c = E_{vac} - \\chi$.\nUsing this relation, the conduction band offset, $\\Delta E_{c}$, is predicted as:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{Anderson}} = E_{c}^{\\mathrm{AlAs}} - E_{c}^{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = \\left(E_{vac} - \\chi^{\\mathrm{AlAs}}\\right) - \\left(E_{vac} - \\chi^{\\mathrm{GaAs}}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $E_{vac}$ is continuous across the interface:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{Anderson}} = \\chi^{\\mathrm{GaAs}} - \\chi^{\\mathrm{AlAs}}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided electron affinities:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{Anderson}} = 4.07\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 3.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.57\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Reporting Final Values and Deviation**\n\nThe problem requires reporting three quantities: $\\Delta E_{v}^{\\mathrm{XPS}}$, $\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}}$, and the deviation $\\delta = \\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}} - \\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{Anderson}}$. We round these to four significant figures as requested.\n\n1.  The XPS-based valence band offset:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{v}^{\\mathrm{XPS}} = -0.60\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\rightarrow -0.6000\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n    $$\n2.  The XPS-inferred conduction band offset:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}} = 0.14\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\rightarrow 0.1400\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n    $$\n3.  The deviation $\\delta$:\n    $$\n    \\delta = \\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}} - \\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{Anderson}} = 0.1400\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.5700\\,\\mathrm{eV} = -0.4300\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n    $$\nThe large deviation $\\delta$ highlights the known limitations of Anderson's rule, which neglects interface dipoles and other effects that are implicitly captured by the experimental XPS measurement.\n\nThe final values to be reported are $\\Delta E_{v}^{\\mathrm{XPS}}$, $\\Delta E_{c}^{\\mathrm{XPS}}$, and $\\delta$.",
