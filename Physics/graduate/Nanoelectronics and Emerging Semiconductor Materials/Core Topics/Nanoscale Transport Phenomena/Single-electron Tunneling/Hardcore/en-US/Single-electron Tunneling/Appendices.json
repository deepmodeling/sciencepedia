            "solution": "This problem requires us to derive the relationships between measured experimental quantities and the intrinsic parameters of a symmetric Single-Electron Transistor (SET), and then to calculate the values of these parameters and their uncertainties. The solution is presented in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the relation for total island capacitance $C_{\\Sigma}$\n\nThe Coulomb staircase in the current-voltage ($I-V_{sd}$) characteristic arises because new charge states on the island become energetically accessible for transport as the source-drain bias $V_{sd}$ is increased. Each step corresponds to the opening of a new conduction channel.\n\nIn the orthodox theory for a symmetric SET ($C_1 = C_2$), the source-drain voltage steps $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$ that lead to sequential opening of transport channels are separated by a voltage related to the energy required to add an additional electron to the system. This energy scale is governed by the total capacitance $C_{\\Sigma}$. The established relationship, which can be derived from the boundaries of consecutive stability regions (Coulomb diamonds), is:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}} = \\frac{e}{C_{\\Sigma}} $$\nThis relation indicates that an increase in bias by $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$ provides just enough energy to overcome the charging energy $e^2/C_{\\Sigma}$ associated with adding another electron to the transport cycle. Therefore, the total capacitance can be expressed as:\n$$ C_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{e}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}} $$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the relation for tunnel resistance $R_T$\n\nThe zero-bias resistance $R_0$ is measured at a gate-charge degeneracy point. At such a point, the gate-induced charge makes the electrostatic energies for two adjacent island charge states equal, meaning there is no energy barrier for the island charge to fluctuate between them. Consequently, for an infinitesimally small source-drain bias ($V_{sd} \\to 0$), the Coulomb blockade is lifted.\n\nWhen the Coulomb blockade is lifted, the SET behaves electrically as a classical circuit consisting of its two tunnel junctions connected in series. Since the SET is symmetric, the two junctions have identical tunnel resistances, $R_1 = R_2 = R_T$. The total resistance of two resistors in series is their sum. Therefore, the measured zero-bias resistance $R_0$ is:\n$$ R_0 = R_1 + R_2 = R_T + R_T = 2R_T $$\nFrom this, the single-junction tunnel resistance $R_T$ is:\n$$ R_T = \\frac{R_0}{2} $$\n\n### Part 3: Uncertainty Propagation and Numerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the best-estimate values for $C_{\\Sigma}$ and $R_T$ using the provided mean values.\n\n**Best estimate for $C_{\\Sigma}$:**\n$$ C_{\\Sigma} = \\frac{e}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}} = \\frac{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}~\\mathrm{C}}{10.40 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 1.54055 \\times 10^{-17}~\\mathrm{F} $$\nConverting to attofarads ($1~\\mathrm{aF} = 10^{-18}~\\mathrm{F}$), we get $C_{\\Sigma} \\approx 15.4055~\\mathrm{aF}$.

We must first find the standard error of the mean for the measured quantities $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$ and $R_0$.\n\n**Uncertainty in $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$:**\nThe spacing $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$ is the difference between two step edge positions. Assuming the noise affecting the edge positions is independent, the variance of a single step-spacing measurement is the sum of the variances of the two edge positions: $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta V) = s_{\\mathrm{edge}}^2 + s_{\\mathrm{edge}}^2 = 2s_{\\mathrm{edge}}^2$. The standard deviation of a single step-spacing measurement is thus $s_{\\Delta V} = \\sqrt{2} s_{\\mathrm{edge}}$. The mean step spacing $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$ is estimated from $N=16$ steps. The standard error of this mean, which we denote as $u(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}})$, is:\n$$ u(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}) = \\frac{s_{\\Delta V}}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} s_{\\mathrm{edge}}}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times 0.24~\\mathrm{mV}}{\\sqrt{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times 0.24}{4}~\\mathrm{mV} \\approx 0.08485~\\mathrm{mV} $$\n\n**Uncertainty in $R_0$:**\nThe mean resistance $R_0$ is estimated from $M=18$ repetitions, with a sample standard deviation of $s_{R_0}$. The standard error of the mean, $u(R_0)$, is:\n$$ u(R_0) = \\frac{s_{R_0}}{\\sqrt{M}} = \\frac{5.2~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega}{\\sqrt{18}} = \\frac{5.2}{3\\sqrt{2}}~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega \\approx 1.2257~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega $$\n\nNow, we propagate these uncertainties to $C_{\\Sigma}$ and $R_T$ using first-order (linear) error propagation.\n\n**Uncertainty in $C_{\\Sigma}$:**\nFor $C_{\\Sigma} = e/\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}$, treating $e$ as an exact constant, the uncertainty $u(C_{\\Sigma})$ is:\n$$ u(C_{\\Sigma}) = \\left| \\frac{\\partial C_{\\Sigma}}{\\partial (\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}})} \\right| u(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}) = \\left| -\\frac{e}{(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}})^2} \\right| u(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}) = \\frac{C_{\\Sigma}}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}} u(\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{sd}}) $$\n$$ u(C_{\\Sigma}) \\approx \\frac{15.4055~\\mathrm{aF}}{10.40~\\mathrm{mV}} \\times (0.08485~\\mathrm{mV}) \\approx 0.1257~\\mathrm{aF} $$\n\n**Uncertainty in $R_T$:**\nFor $R_T = R_0/2$, the uncertainty $u(R_T)$ is:\n$$ u(R_T) = \\left| \\frac{\\partial R_T}{\\partial R_0} \\right| u(R_0) = \\frac{1}{2} u(R_0) $$\n$$ u(R_T) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\times (1.2257~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega) \\approx 0.6129~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega $$\n\nThe problem asks for the best-estimate numerical values of $C_{\\Sigma}$ (in aF) and $R_T$ (in k$\\Omega$), rounded to three significant figures.\n- Best estimate for $C_{\\Sigma}$: $15.4~\\mathrm{aF}$\n- Best estimate for $R_T$: $114~\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$",
