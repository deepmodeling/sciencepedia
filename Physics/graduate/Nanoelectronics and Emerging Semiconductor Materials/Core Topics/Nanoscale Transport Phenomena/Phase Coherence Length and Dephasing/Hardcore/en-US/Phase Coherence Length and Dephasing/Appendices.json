The transport is phase coherent over a temperature-dependent length $L_{\\phi}(T)$ set by electron dephasing. Universal Conductance Fluctuations (UCF) are measured in a perpendicular magnetic field strong enough to break time-reversal symmetry but weak enough not to alter the diffusion constant, so that the symmetry class is unitary and the prefactor of the UCF amplitude is temperature independent.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds in two stages: first, a derivation of the scaling of the root-mean-square (rms) Universal Conductance Fluctuations (UCF) amplitude with the phase-coherence length, and second, the extraction of the temperature-dependence exponent from the provided data.\n\nThe quasi-one-dimensional nanowire has a length $L$, width $w$, and thickness $t$, with the hierarchy of scales given as $L \\gg L_{\\phi}(T) \\gg \\max\\{w, t\\}$. The condition $L \\gg L_{\\phi}(T)$ allows us to treat the wire as a series of incoherent segments. We can model the total length $L$ as being composed of $N$ statistically independent segments, each of length equal to the phase coherence length, $L_{\\phi}$. The number of such segments is given by:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}}$$\nSince the segments are arranged in series, the total resistance $R$ of the wire is the sum of the resistances $R_i$ of each individual segment:\n$$R = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i$$\nThe fluctuations in the total resistance, $\\delta R = R - \\langle R \\rangle$, are the sum of the fluctuations of the individual segments, $\\delta R_i = R_i - \\langle R_i \\rangle$.\n$$\\delta R = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\delta R_i$$\nAccording to the problem statement, these segments fluctuate independently. For statistically independent random variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. Therefore, the variance of the total resistance, $\\mathrm{Var}(R) = \\langle (\\delta R)^2 \\rangle$, is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(R) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(R_i)$$\nAs all segments have the same length $L_{\\phi}$ and are statistically identical, their resistance variances are equal: $\\mathrm{Var}(R_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(R_{\\phi})$ for all $i$. Thus:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(R) = N \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(R_{\\phi}) = \\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}} \\mathrm{Var}(R_{\\phi})$$\nThe root-mean-square resistance fluctuation, $\\delta R_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\delta R_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(R)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}}} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(R_{\\phi})} = \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}}\\right)^{1/2} \\delta R_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}}$$\nwhere $\\delta R_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}}$ is the rms resistance fluctuation of a single phase-coherent segment of length $L_{\\phi}$.\n\nNext, we relate the resistance fluctuations to the conductance fluctuations. For small fluctuations, where $\\delta R \\ll \\langle R \\rangle$, the conductance fluctuation $\\delta G$ can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion of $G = 1/R$ around the average resistance $\\langle R \\rangle$:\n$$\\delta G = G - \\langle G \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\langle R \\rangle + \\delta R} - \\frac{1}{\\langle R \\rangle} \\approx -\\frac{\\delta R}{\\langle R \\rangle^2}$$\nThe rms conductance fluctuation $\\delta G_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ is then related to $\\delta R_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ by:\n$$\\delta G_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\langle (\\delta G)^2 \\rangle} \\approx \\sqrt{\\left\\langle \\left( -\\frac{\\delta R}{\\langle R \\rangle^2} \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\delta R)^2 \\rangle}}{\\langle R \\rangle^2} = \\frac{\\delta R_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\langle R \\rangle^2}$$\nThe average resistance of the wire is $\\langle R \\rangle = N \\langle R_{\\phi} \\rangle = \\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}} \\langle R_{\\phi} \\rangle$, where $\\langle R_{\\phi} \\rangle$ is the average resistance of a segment of length $L_{\\phi}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\delta R_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ and $\\langle R \\rangle$:\n$$\\delta G_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\approx \\frac{(L/L_{\\phi})^{1/2} \\delta R_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}}}{(L/L_{\\phi})^2 \\langle R_{\\phi} \\rangle^2} = \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}}\\right)^{-3/2} \\frac{\\delta R_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}}}{\\langle R_{\\phi} \\rangle^2}$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\delta R_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}}}{\\langle R_{\\phi} \\rangle^2}$ is precisely the rms conductance fluctuation, $\\delta G_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}}$, of a single phase-coherent segment. The theory of Universal Conductance Fluctuations states that for a single coherent conductor (where the sample length is the coherence length), the rms amplitude of conductance fluctuations is a universal constant of the order of the conductance quantum, $e^2/h$.\n$$\\delta G_{\\phi, \\mathrm{rms}} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$$\nHere, $C$ is a numerical prefactor that depends on the symmetry class. The problem states the symmetry is unitary, so $C$ is a specific constant. Consequently, the rms conductance fluctuation for the entire wire is:\n$$\\delta G_{\\mathrm{rms}} = C \\frac{e^2}{h} \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\phi}}\\right)^{-3/2}$$\nThe length of the wire $L$ is a constant. Therefore, the scaling of the dimensionless UCF amplitude with the coherence length is:\n$$\\frac{\\delta G_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{e^2/h} \\propto L_{\\phi}^{3/2}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we use the provided data to find the exponent $m$ in the assumed temperature dependence of the coherence length, $L_{\\phi}(T) \\propto T^{-m}$. Let us denote the dimensionless UCF amplitude as $Y(T) = \\delta G_{\\mathrm{rms}}(T) / (e^2/h)$. Combining the two proportionalities:\n$$Y(T) \\propto L_{\\phi}^{3/2} \\propto (T^{-m})^{3/2} = T^{-3m/2}$$\nThis establishes a power-law relationship $Y(T) = A T^{-3m/2}$ for some constant $A$. To determine the exponent, we can analyze the relationship in logarithmic form:\n$$\\ln(Y) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{3m}{2} \\ln(T)$$\nThis equation is of the form $y = c + b x$, where $y = \\ln(Y)$, $x = \\ln(T)$, and the slope is $b = -3m/2$.

Squaring the values of $Y$:\n- $Y_1^2 = (0.632455532)^2 \\approx 0.400000000$\n- $Y_2^2 = (0.447213595)^2 \\approx 0.200000000$\n- $Y_3^2 = (0.282842712)^2 \\approx 0.080000000$\n- $Y_4^2 = (0.200000000)^2 = 0.040000000$\n- $Y_5^2 = (0.141421356)^2 \\approx 0.020000000$\n\nThe data have been constructed to high precision such that a simple relationship is evident. Let's check the product $Y_i^2 T_i$:\n- $Y_1^2 T_1 = 0.4 \\times 0.10 = 0.04$\n- $Y_2^2 T_2 = 0.2 \\times 0.20 = 0.04$\n- $Y_3^2 T_3 = 0.08 \\times 0.50 = 0.04$\n- $Y_4^2 T_4 = 0.04 \\times 1.00 = 0.04$\n- $Y_5^2 T_5 = 0.02 \\times 2.00 = 0.04$\nThe data perfectly fits the relation $Y^2 T = 0.04$, which means $Y^2 \\propto T^{-1}$.\nFrom our theoretical derivation, $Y \\propto T^{-3m/2}$, which implies $Y^2 \\propto (T^{-3m/2})^2 = T^{-3m}$.\nComparing the exponent of $T$ from the data analysis with our derived expression:\n$$-3m = -1$$\nSolving for $m$ yields:\n$$m = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis result is in perfect agreement with the standard theoretical prediction for dephasing due to electron-electron interactions (Nyquist noise) in a quasi-one-dimensional diffusive conductor, where the dephasing rate is $\\tau_{\\phi}^{-1} \\propto T^{2/3}$. Since the dephasing length $L_{\\phi} = \\sqrt{D \\tau_{\\phi}}$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant, it follows that $L_{\\phi} \\propto \\sqrt{\\tau_{\\phi}} \\propto (\\tau_{\\phi}^{-1})^{-1/2} \\propto (T^{2/3})^{-1/2} = T^{-1/3}$. The predicted exponent is indeed $m = 1/3$.\n\nThe final step is to report the numerical value of $m$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$m = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333333...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $m = 0.3333$.",

Substituting the expressions for the electrochemical potentials, $\\mu_S = E_F + eV/2$ and $\\mu_D = E_F - eV/2$, the integral for the current simplifies to an average of the transmission probability $T(E)$ over the energy window of width $eV$ centered at $E_F$:\n$$I = \\frac{e}{h}\\int_{E_F - eV/2}^{E_F + eV/2} dE\\,T(E)$$\nThe transmission probability through the AB ring, $T(E)$, contains an oscillatory component due to quantum interference between the two paths. For a symmetric two-path interferometer, $T(E)$ can be written as:\n$$T(E) = T_{bg}(E) + T_{osc}(E) \\cos(\\phi(E))$$\nwhere $T_{bg}(E)$ is a slowly varying background transmission, $T_{osc}(E)$ is the amplitude of the interference term, and $\\phi(E)$ is the total phase difference between the two paths. This phase difference consists of a magnetic flux-dependent Aharonov-Bohm phase $\\phi_{AB}$ and a dynamic phase from the path-length difference $\\Delta L = L_1 - L_2$.\n$$\\phi(E) = k(E) \\Delta L + \\phi_{AB}$$\nThe problem states the dispersion is approximately linear near $E_F$. The energy-wavenumber relation is $E - E_0 \\approx \\hbar v_F (k - k_0)$. Thus, the wavenumber $k(E)$ can be approximated as a linear function of energy around $E_F$:\n$$k(E) \\approx k_F + \\frac{E - E_F}{\\hbar v_F}$$\nwhere $k_F$ is the Fermi wavenumber. The phase difference becomes:\n$$\\phi(E) \\approx \\left(k_F + \\frac{E-E_F}{\\hbar v_F}\\right) \\Delta L + \\phi_{AB} = \\phi_0 + \\frac{(E-E_F)\\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}$$\nwhere $\\phi_0 = k_F \\Delta L + \\phi_{AB}$ is the phase difference at the Fermi energy.\n\nThe oscillatory part of the current, $I_{osc}$, is obtained by integrating the oscillatory part of the transmission:\n$$I_{osc} = \\frac{e}{h}\\int_{E_F - eV/2}^{E_F + eV/2} dE\\, T_{osc}(E) \\cos\\left(\\phi_0 + \\frac{(E-E_F)\\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)$$\nAssuming $T_{osc}(E)$ is approximately constant over the narrow energy window $eV$, we treat it as $T_{osc}(E_F)$. Let $u = E - E_F$, so $du = dE$. The integral becomes:\n$$I_{osc} \\approx \\frac{e}{h} T_{osc}(E_F) \\int_{-eV/2}^{+eV/2} du\\, \\cos\\left(\\phi_0 + \\frac{u \\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\\int_{-eV/2}^{+eV/2} \\cos\\left(\\phi_0 + \\frac{u \\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}\\right) du = \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{\\Delta L} \\sin\\left(\\phi_0 + \\frac{u \\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}\\right) \\right]_{-eV/2}^{+eV/2}$$\n$$= \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{\\Delta L} \\left[ \\sin\\left(\\phi_0 + \\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right) - \\sin\\left(\\phi_0 - \\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(A+B) - \\sin(A-B) = 2\\cos(A)\\sin(B)$, the integral evaluates to:\n$$= \\frac{2\\hbar v_F}{\\Delta L} \\cos(\\phi_0) \\sin\\left(\\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I_{osc}$:\n$$I_{osc} \\approx \\frac{e}{h} T_{osc}(E_F) \\cos(\\phi_0) \\left( \\frac{2\\hbar v_F}{\\Delta L} \\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right)$$\nThe zero-bias limit of the differential conductance $G=dI/dV$ is often used to define visibility. However, at finite bias $V$, the observed quantity is often the chord conductance $G=I/V$. In this context, the amplitude of the current oscillations is what matters. The amplitude of $I_{osc}$ is modulated by the factor derived above. Let's analyze the zero-bias limit. For small $V$, $\\sin(x) \\approx x$.\n$$I_{osc}(V \\to 0) \\approx \\frac{e}{h} T_{osc}(E_F) \\cos(\\phi_0) \\left( \\frac{2\\hbar v_F}{\\Delta L} \\right) \\left(\\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right) = \\frac{e^2 V}{h} T_{osc}(E_F) \\cos(\\phi_0)$$\nThe oscillatory part of the conductance at low bias is $G_{osc} = I_{osc}/V = \\frac{e^2}{h} T_{osc}(E_F) \\cos(\\phi_0)$. The visibility is proportional to the amplitude of this term, $T_{osc}(E_F)$.\nAt finite bias $V$, we can rewrite the full expression for $I_{osc}$ to make the modulating factor explicit:\n$$I_{osc} \\approx \\left[ \\frac{e^2 V}{h} T_{osc}(E_F) \\cos(\\phi_0) \\right] \\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right)}{\\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}}$$\nThe visibility of the oscillations, which is proportional to the amplitude of $I_{osc}$ (or $G_{osc}=I_{osc}/V$), is modulated by the sinc function, $\\mathrm{sinc}(x) = \\sin(x)/x$:\n$$\\text{Visibility} \\propto \\left| \\mathrm{sinc}\\left(\\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}\\right) \\right|$$\nThis sinc function decay arises from averaging the oscillatory function $\\cos(\\phi(E))$ over a finite energy window of width $eV$. Electrons with different energies acquire different phase shifts, and their contributions interfere, reducing the net oscillation amplitude. This is the \"dephasing\" effect due to energy averaging.\n\n### Calculation of Voltage\n\nThe visibility is reduced to one-half of its zero-bias value when the sinc function equals $1/2$. The zero-bias value corresponds to $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\mathrm{sinc}(x) = 1$.\nLet $x = \\frac{eV\\Delta L}{2\\hbar v_F}$. We must solve the equation:\n$$\\mathrm{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis is a transcendental equation, which we must solve numerically. The smallest positive root is sought, as this corresponds to the first time the visibility drops to half its maximum.\nSolving $\\sin(x) = x/2$ yields $x \\approx 1.89549$.\n\nNow we solve for the voltage $V$:\n$$V = \\frac{2 x \\hbar v_F}{e \\Delta L}$$\nWe use the given values and physical constants in SI units:\n- $x \\approx 1.89549$ (dimensionless)\n- $\\hbar = 1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$ (reduced Planck constant)\n- $v_F = 1.50 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $e = 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$ (elementary charge)\n- $\\Delta L = 2.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$V = \\frac{2 \\times (1.89549) \\times (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}) \\times (1.50 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m/s})}{(1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})}$$\n$$V \\approx \\frac{5.9979 \\times 10^{-29}}{3.2044 \\times 10^{-26}}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V \\approx 1.87179 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$V \\approx 1.87\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$",
