            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a standard, solvable problem in condensed matter physics without internal contradictions, factual unsoundness, or ambiguity. All necessary physical parameters, definitions, and boundary conditions for a unique solution are provided. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the density of states per unit area, $D(E)$, and the quantum capacitance per unit area, $C_q/A$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Density of States $D(E)$**\n\nThe density of states per unit area, $D(E)$, is defined as the number of single-particle states per unit energy per unit area. We begin by considering the states in the two-dimensional $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The number of allowed states $dN$ within a differential area element $d^2\\mathbf{k}$ in $\\mathbf{k}$-space for a sample of real-space area $A$ is given by:\n$$dN = g \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} d^2\\mathbf{k}$$\nwhere $g$ is the total degeneracy factor. The problem states that due to spin-momentum locking, the spin degeneracy is removed, and there is no valley degeneracy. Thus, the total degeneracy factor is $g=1$. We are interested in quantities per unit area, so we can consider the density of states $dn = dN/A$:\n$$dn = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} d^2\\mathbf{k}$$\nThe energy dispersion relation is isotropic, $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\pm \\hbar v_F |\\mathbf{k}|$, which suggests using polar coordinates in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. Let $|\\mathbf{k}| = k$. The differential area element is $d^2\\mathbf{k} = k \\, dk \\, d\\theta$. Substituting this into the expression for $dn$:\n$$dn = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} k \\, dk \\, d\\theta$$\nTo find the number of states in a thin annulus between $k$ and $k+dk$, we integrate over the angle $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$:\n$$dn = \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\frac{k \\, dk}{(2\\pi)^2} = 2\\pi \\frac{k \\, dk}{(2\\pi)^2} = \\frac{k}{2\\pi} dk$$\nBy definition, the density of states per unit area $D(E)$ satisfies $dn = D(E) dE$. Therefore:\n$$D(E) dE = \\frac{k}{2\\pi} dk$$\nThis gives the relation $D(E) = \\frac{k}{2\\pi} \\frac{dk}{dE}$.\nWe use the given dispersion relation to find the relationship between $k$ and $E$. For the conduction band ($E0$), we have $E = \\hbar v_F k$. For the valence band ($E0$), we have $E = -\\hbar v_F k$. In both cases, the magnitude of the wave vector is $k = |E| / (\\hbar v_F)$.\nNow, we find the derivative $dk/dE$. For $E0$, $k = E/(\\hbar v_F)$, so $dk/dE = 1/(\\hbar v_F)$.\nSubstituting $k$ and $dk/dE$ into the expression for $D(E)$:\n$$D(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{E}{\\hbar v_F} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar v_F} \\right) = \\frac{E}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nThis expression is for $E0$. For $E0$, a similar calculation yields $D(E) = \\frac{-E}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2}$. A general expression valid for both bands is:\n$$D(E) = \\frac{|E|}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nThis is the functional form of the density of states per unit area for the helical Dirac fermion surface state.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Quantum Capacitance $C_q/A$**\n\nThe problem defines the quantum capacitance $C_q$ as the derivative of charge density with respect to electrochemical potential. Let the charge density (charge per unit area) be $\\sigma$. Let the electrochemical potential be $\\mu_{ec}$. Then the quantum capacitance per unit area is $C_q/A = d\\sigma/d\\mu_{ec}$.\nThe charge carriers are electrons, so the added charge is $dQ = -e dN_e$, where $dN_e$ is the number of added electrons. The electrochemical potential energy for an electron is $\\mu$, so the potential is $\\mu_{ec} = \\mu/(-e)$. The charge density is $\\sigma = -e n$, where $n$ is the electron density per unit area.\nTherefore, the quantum capacitance per unit area is:\n$$ \\frac{C_q}{A} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\mu_{ec}} = \\frac{d(-en)}{d(\\mu/(-e))} = e^2 \\frac{dn}{d\\mu} $$\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$ K), all states up to the chemical potential $\\mu$ (which is the Fermi energy $E_F$) are filled, and all states above it are empty. The electron density $n$ is found by integrating the density of states from the charge neutrality point (the Dirac point, $E=0$) up to the chemical potential $\\mu$. Assuming $\\mu  0$ as given:\n$$n(\\mu) = \\int_0^\\mu D(E) dE$$\nThen, the derivative $dn/d\\mu$ is simply the density of states at the chemical potential, by the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n$$\\frac{dn}{d\\mu} = D(\\mu)$$\nSo, the quantum capacitance per unit area at $T=0$ K is given by:\n$$\\frac{C_q}{A} = e^2 D(\\mu)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $D(E)$:\n$$\\frac{C_q}{A} = e^2 \\frac{|\\mu|}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values into this formula.\nThe given parameters in SI units are:\n- $v_{F} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ m/s\n- $\\mu = 0.080$ eV $= 0.080 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}) = 1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-20}$ J\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}$ C\n- $\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $(\\hbar v_F)^2$:\n$$\\hbar v_F = (1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m/s}) = 5.272859085 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ J·m}$$\n$$(\\hbar v_F)^2 = (5.272859085 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ J·m})^2 \\approx 2.78030 \\times 10^{-57} \\text{ J}^2\\text{·m}^2$$\nNow we compute the capacitance per unit area in SI units (F/m$^2$):\n$$\\frac{C_q}{A} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2 \\times (1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-20})}{2\\pi \\times (2.78030 \\times 10^{-57})} \\frac{\\text{C}^2 \\text{·J}}{\\text{J}^2 \\text{·m}^2}$$\n$$\\frac{C_q}{A} \\approx \\frac{3.29033 \\times 10^{-58}}{1.74690 \\times 10^{-56}} \\frac{\\text{C}^2}{\\text{J·m}^2} \\approx 0.018835 \\text{ F/m}^2$$\nThe unit $\\text{C}^2/\\text{J}$ is equivalent to the Farad, $F$.\nThe problem requires the answer in units of nF/cm$^2$. We perform the conversion:\n$1$ F/m$^2 = \\frac{10^9 \\text{ nF}}{(100 \\text{ cm})^2} = \\frac{10^9 \\text{ nF}}{10^4 \\text{ cm}^2} = 10^5$ nF/cm$^2$.\nSo, we multiply our result by $10^5$:\n$$\\frac{C_q}{A} \\approx 0.018835 \\times 10^5 \\text{ nF/cm}^2 \\approx 1883.5 \\text{ nF/cm}^2$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\\frac{C_q}{A} \\approx 1880 \\text{ nF/cm}^2$$",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Quantum Capacitance\nThe quantum capacitance per unit area, $C_{q}$, is defined as $C_{q} = e^{2} \\dfrac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}$. The quantity $n$ represents the net charge carrier density per unit area, which is the density of electrons in the conduction band minus the density of holes in the valence band.\n\nThe density of electrons, $n_{e}$, is given by the integral of the DOS times the occupation probability over the conduction band ($E  0$):\n$$n_{e}(\\mu, T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} D(E) f(E; \\mu, T) dE$$\nThe density of holes, $n_{h}$, is the density of unoccupied states in the valence band ($E  0$):\n$$n_{h}(\\mu, T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} D(E) [1 - f(E; \\mu, T)] dE$$\nThe net carrier density is $n(\\mu, T) = n_{e}(\\mu, T) - n_{h}(\\mu, T)$.\n\nLet us first evaluate $n_{e}(\\mu, T)$. Substituting the given DOS, $D(E) = \\frac{g_{s} g_{v} E}{2 \\pi (\\hbar v_{F})^{2}}$ for $E  0$. Let $A = \\frac{g_{s} g_{v}}{2 \\pi (\\hbar v_{F})^{2}}$.\n$$n_{e}(\\mu, T) = A \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right)} dE$$\nLet's perform a change of variables: $x = E/(k_{B}T)$ and define the reduced chemical potential $\\mu' = \\mu/(k_{B}T)$. Then $E = x k_{B}T$ and $dE = k_{B}T dx$.\n$$n_{e}(\\mu, T) = A (k_{B}T)^{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{1 + \\exp(x - \\mu')} dx$$\nThis integral is related to the complete Fermi-Dirac integral $F_{j}(z) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(j+1)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{j}}{1 + \\exp(x-z)} dx$. For $j=1$, $\\Gamma(2)=1$, so the integral is $F_{1}(\\mu') = -\\text{Li}_{2}(-\\exp(\\mu'))$, where $\\text{Li}_{2}$ is the dilogarithm function.\n$$n_{e}(\\mu, T) = A (k_{B}T)^{2} [-\\text{Li}_{2}(-\\exp(\\mu'))]$$\n\nNext, we evaluate $n_{h}(\\mu, T)$. The DOS for $E  0$ is $D(E) = -A E$.\n$$n_{h}(\\mu, T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} (-AE) \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right)} \\right] dE$$\nUsing the identity $1 - f(E; \\mu) = f(-E; -\\mu)$, we get:\n$$n_{h}(\\mu, T) = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} (-E) f(-E; -\\mu, T) dE$$\nLet $E' = -E$.

Work in the International System of Units (SI) and express all final capacitances in $\\mathrm{F/m^2}$.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to graphene at zero temperature, use the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base:\n\n- The reduced Planck constant is $\\hbar$, the elementary charge is $e$, and the Fermi velocity in graphene is $v_F$.\n- Graphene has a linear energy-momentum relation near the Dirac point, $E(k) = \\hbar v_F |k|$.\n- The two-dimensional density of states (DOS) including spin and valley degeneracy is $D(E) = \\dfrac{2 |E|}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2}$.\n- The net carrier density at zero temperature satisfies $n = \\operatorname{sgn}(E_F)\\, \\dfrac{E_F^2}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2}$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy measured from the Dirac point and $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\cdot)$ denotes the sign function.\n- The quantum capacitance per unit area is $C_q(n) = e^2 D(E_F)$ evaluated at the Fermi energy corresponding to $n$.\n- The electrostatic relation between charge, voltage, and geometric capacitance is $e n = C_{geom} V_{ox}$.\n- The channel potential shift is related to the Fermi energy by $V_{ch} = E_F/e$.\n\nDerive a self-consistent relation for $n$ as a function of $V_g$ by combining the above, and then compute the total differential capacitance $C_{tot}(V_g) = d(e n)/dV_g$. Do not use any pre-derived shortcut expressions for the target quantity; instead, begin from the stated fundamental base and derive the needed relations.\n\nImplement a program that:\n- Uses constants $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, $\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$, $\\epsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$, and $v_F = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- For each test case, computes $C_{geom}$, solves self-consistently for $n(V_g)$ using the zero-temperature graphene relations, and evaluates $C_{tot}(V_g)$ via the differential definition $C_{tot}(V_g) = d(e n)/dV_g$.\n- Handles the limit $V_g \\rightarrow 0$ carefully so that the program remains numerically stable and physically consistent with the vanishing quantum capacitance at the Dirac point.\n\nUse the following test suite (each tuple is $(\\epsilon_r, t\\,\\mathrm{in\\,nm}, V_g\\,\\mathrm{in\\,V})$):\n- Case A: $(3.9, 300.0, +1.0)$ for silicon dioxide.\n- Case B: $(3.9, 300.0, -1.0)$ for silicon dioxide (opposite polarity).\n- Case C: $(20.0, 10.0, +0.05)$ for hafnium dioxide (high-$\\kappa$).\n- Case D: $(3.2, 1.0, +0.2)$ for hexagonal boron nitride (ultrathin dielectric).\n- Case E: $(1.0, 100.0, +5.0)$ for a vacuum gap.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the values of $C_{tot}(V_g)$ for the above test cases in $\\mathrm{F/m^2}$, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as specified in the test suite (e.g., \"[$c_A, c_B, c_C, c_D, c_E$]\").",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the standard zero-temperature model of a graphene field-effect transistor, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of physical relations and parameters, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no identifiable flaws. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the total differential capacitance per unit area, $C_{tot}(V_g)$, of a back-gated graphene sheet, defined as $C_{tot}(V_g) = dQ/dV_g$, where $Q=en$ is the induced charge density and $V_g$ is the applied gate voltage relative to the neutrality point. The derivation will start from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nThe total gate voltage $V_g$ is partitioned between the voltage drop across the dielectric, $V_{ox}$, and the shift in the graphene channel's electrochemical potential per unit charge, $V_{ch}$.\n$$V_g = V_{ox} + V_{ch}$$\nThe charge density $Q=en$ on the graphene is related to the dielectric voltage $V_{ox}$ through the geometric capacitance per unit area, $C_{geom}$:\n$$e n = C_{geom} V_{ox}$$\nwhere $C_{geom} = \\epsilon/t = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 / t$. The channel potential $V_{ch}$ is related to the Fermi energy $E_F$ (measured from the Dirac point) by:\n$$V_{ch} = E_F / e$$\nSubstituting these relations into the voltage partition equation gives a self-consistent expression for the gate voltage:\n$$V_g = \\frac{e n}{C_{geom}} + \\frac{E_F}{e}$$\nAt zero temperature, the net carrier density $n$ is determined by the states filled up to the Fermi energy $E_F$:\n$$n = \\int_{0}^{E_F} D(E')\\,dE' = \\int_{0}^{E_F} \\frac{2 E'}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2} \\,dE' = \\frac{E_F^2}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nThis expression is valid for $E_F  0$ (electrons). For $E_F  0$ (holes), the density $n$ is negative, so the general relation is:\n$$n = \\operatorname{sgn}(E_F)\\, \\frac{E_F^2}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nFrom this, we see that $\\operatorname{sgn}(n) = \\operatorname{sgn}(E_F)$. In the self-consistent equation for $V_g$, both terms on the right-hand side, $e n/C_{geom}$ and $E_F/e$, have the same sign as $E_F$. Therefore, the sign of the gate voltage must also be the same: $\\operatorname{sgn}(V_g) = \\operatorname{sgn}(E_F) = \\operatorname{sgn}(n)$. This allows us to work with magnitudes:\n$$|V_g| = \\frac{e |n|}{C_{geom}} + \\frac{|E_F|}{e}$$\nSubstituting $|n| = E_F^2 / (\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2)$:\n$$|V_g| = \\frac{e}{C_{geom}} \\frac{E_F^2}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2} + \\frac{|E_F|}{e}$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $|E_F|$. Let $x = |E_F|$. We have:\n$$\\left( \\frac{e}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2} \\right) x^2 + \\frac{1}{e} x - |V_g| = 0$$\nTo find the total capacitance, $C_{tot} = d(en)/dV_g$, it is most elegant to use the chain rule and the concept of quantum capacitance, $C_q$. The total capacitance can be viewed as a series combination of the geometric and quantum capacitances. To show this, we differentiate the voltage equation $V_g = V_{ox} + V_{ch}$ with respect to the charge $Q = en$:\n$$\\frac{dV_g}{dQ} = \\frac{dV_{ox}}{dQ} + \\frac{dV_{ch}}{dQ}$$\nBy definition, $C_{tot}^{-1} = dV_g/dQ$. From $Q = C_{geom} V_{ox}$, we have $C_{geom}^{-1} = dV_{ox}/dQ$. The term $dV_{ch}/dQ$ represents the inverse of the capacitance of the graphene channel itself, which is the quantum capacitance, $C_q$. Thus, $C_q^{-1} = dV_{ch}/dQ$. This gives the series capacitor model:\n$$C_{tot}^{-1} = C_{geom}^{-1} + C_q^{-1} \\implies C_{tot} = \\frac{C_{geom} C_q}{C_{geom} + C_q}$$\nThe quantum capacitance is defined as $C_q = e^2 D(E_F)$, where $D(E_F)$ is the density of states at the Fermi level.\n$$C_q(E_F) = e^2 \\cdot \\frac{2 |E_F|}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nTo compute $C_{tot}$, we must first find $|E_F|$ for a given $V_g$ by solving the quadratic equation, then compute $C_q$, and finally combine it with $C_{geom}$.\n\nHowever, a more direct and numerically robust expression for $C_{tot}(V_g)$ can be derived. Solving the quadratic equation for $|E_F|$ (taking the physically meaningful positive root) yields:\n$$|E_F| = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{e} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{e^2} + 4 \\left( \\frac{e}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2} \\right) |V_g|}}{2 \\left( \\frac{e}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2} \\right)}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C_q$:\n$$C_q = \\frac{2 e^2}{\\pi (\\hbar v_F)^2} |E_F| = C_{geom} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4 e^3 |V_g|}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2}} \\right)$$\nLet us define a dimensionless parameter grouping the constants, $K = \\frac{4 e^3}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$C_q = C_{geom} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|} - 1 \\right)$$\nNow, substituting this into the series capacitor formula for $C_{tot}$:\n$$C_{tot} = \\frac{C_{geom} \\left[ C_{geom} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|} - 1 \\right) \\right]}{C_{geom} + C_{geom} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|} - 1 \\right)} = \\frac{C_{geom} \\left( \\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|} - 1 \\right)}{1 + \\left( \\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|} - 1 \\right)}$$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression for the total capacitance:\n$$C_{tot}(V_g) = C_{geom} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|}} \\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad K = \\frac{4 e^3}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2}$$\nThis expression is valid for any $V_g$. For $V_g \\to 0$, $K|V_g| \\to 0$, and using the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1+x/2$ for small $x$, we find $C_{tot}(V_g) \\approx C_{geom}(1 - (1 - K|V_g|/2)) = C_{geom} K |V_g|/2$. Since $C_{geom}$ is in the denominator of $K$, $C_{tot}$ is independent of $C_{geom}$ in this limit and goes to $0$ as $V_g \\to 0$. This correctly reflects the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. For large $|V_g|$, the square root term dominates, causing $C_{tot} \\to C_{geom}$, which corresponds to the limit where the quantum capacitance becomes very large and no longer limits the total capacitance. This formula provides a robust basis for the numerical implementation. Note that the sign of $V_g$ does not affect the magnitude of the capacitance, as expected from the electron-hole symmetry of the model.\n\nThe algorithm for the program is as follows:\n1. For each test case $(\\epsilon_r, t, V_g)$, first compute $C_{geom} = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 / t$. Note that $t$ must be in meters.\n2. Compute the constant factor $K = \\frac{4 e^3}{\\pi C_{geom} (\\hbar v_F)^2}$.\n3. Calculate the total capacitance using the final derived formula $C_{tot}(V_g) = C_{geom} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + K|V_g|}} \\right)$. This single formula is numerically stable and valid for all $V_g$, including $V_g = 0$ where it correctly yields $C_{tot} = 0$.",
