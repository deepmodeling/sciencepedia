            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Oersted field generated by a uniform current in a heavy metal (HM) slab and its comparison to a typical field-like spin-orbit torque effective field. The first step is to apply Ampère's law in its magnetostatic form for the magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = I_{\\mathrm{enc}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}$ is a closed loop and $I_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ is the total current passing through the surface enclosed by the loop.\n\nThe system is an infinitely wide slab of thickness $t$ occupying the region $-t \\leq z \\leq 0$. The current density is uniform, $\\mathbf{J}_{c} = J_{c} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n\nFrom the symmetry of the problem, we can deduce the form of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$. Because the slab is infinite in the $x$ and $y$ directions and the current is uniform, the magnetic field cannot depend on the $x$ or $y$ coordinates. Thus, $\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}(z)$. The current flows in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction. By the right-hand rule (or from the Biot-Savart law, $d\\mathbf{B} \\propto d\\mathbf{l} \\times \\mathbf{r}$), the magnetic field lines must circulate around the current. For a sheet of current in the $xy$-plane, the field will be parallel to the plane. By considering the cancellation of field components from different parts of the infinite slab, we find that the magnetic field must be oriented along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction. Therefore, the magnetic field takes the form $\\mathbf{H}(z) = H_y(z) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nFurthermore, the problem possesses an anti-symmetry with respect to the central plane of the current-carrying slab, which is at $z = -t/2$. The field at a distance $d$ above this plane must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the field at a distance $d$ below it. This implies $H_y(-t/2 + d) = -H_y(-t/2 - d)$. For a point $z$, its distance from the center is $z - (-t/2) = z+t/2$. The symmetrically opposite point is at $-t/2 - (z+t/2) = -t-z$. Thus, we have the symmetry relation $H_y(z) = -H_y(-t-z)$.\n\nTo find the field at the ferromagnet (FM) interface, $z = 0^{+}$, we consider a rectangular Amperian loop in the $y-z$ plane with length $L$ along the $y$-direction. Let the loop be positioned symmetrically with respect to the slab's center, extending from $z' = -t-z$ to $z$ (where $z \\ge 0$). The integral $\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\int_{\\text{top}} \\mathbf{H}(z) \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} + \\int_{\\text{bottom}} \\mathbf{H}(-t-z) \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = L H_y(z) - L H_y(-t-z)\n$$\nThe integrals over the vertical segments are zero as $\\mathbf{H}$ is perpendicular to $d\\mathbf{l}$ along these paths.\n\nUsing the symmetry relation $H_y(-t-z) = -H_y(z)$, the loop integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = L H_y(z) - L(-H_y(z)) = 2 L H_y(z)\n$$\nFor any $z \\ge 0$, the Amperian loop encloses the entire current-carrying slab (from $z=0$ to $z=-t$). The total enclosed current $I_{\\mathrm{enc}}$ is the current density $J_c$ multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the slab defined by the loop, which is $L \\times t$.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{enc}} = J_c (L \\times t)\n$$\nApplying Ampère's law, we equate the two expressions:\n$$\n2 L H_y(z) = J_c L t\n$$\nSolving for $H_y(z)$ for $z \\ge 0$:\n$$\nH_y(z) = \\frac{1}{2} J_c t\n$$\nThis result is valid for any position above the slab, including the FM interface at $z=0^{+}$. The Oersted field vector at this interface is thus:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{Oe}} = \\frac{1}{2} J_c t \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThe problem states to use the relation $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{H}$, which is appropriate given the assumption of unity relative permeability.
