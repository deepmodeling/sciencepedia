The given numerical values are physically plausible for typical heavy-metal/ferromagnet heterostructures. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\n**1. Derivation of the Effective Damping-Like Field ($\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$)**\n\na. A charge current with density $\\vec{j} = j \\hat{x}$ flowing in the heavy metal generates a transverse pure spin current via the Spin Hall Effect (SHE). This spin current is injected into the adjacent ferromagnet.\n\nb. The injected spin current density, expressed as an equivalent charge current density, is $j_s = \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j$. Each electron in this current carries an angular momentum of $\\hbar/2$. Therefore, the flux of angular momentum per unit area (spin current density) is given by:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{spin}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e} j_s = \\frac{\\hbar \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j}{2e}\n$$\nThe spin polarization is given as $\\hat{\\sigma} \\parallel +\\hat{y}$.\n\nc. This spin current is completely absorbed within the ferromagnet of thickness $t_F$. The absorption of spin angular momentum exerts a torque on the local magnetization. In the LLG formalism, this torque is modeled as arising from an effective damping-like field, $H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$.\n\nd. The magnitude of this field, when expressed as a magnetic flux density $\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j}{2e M_s t_F}\n$$\nThis direct relationship comes from equating the rate of angular momentum transfer from the spin current to the torque exerted by the effective field on the magnetization. The expression on the right-hand side has units of Tesla.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Steady-State Domain Wall Velocity ($v$)**\n\na. The problem specifies a rigid Néel wall under steady flow. The dynamics are described by the one-dimensional collective-coordinate model. In this model, the SOT exerts a pressure or effective force on the domain wall, driving its motion. This driving force is balanced by the Gilbert damping force, which opposes the motion.\n\nb. The driving force from SOT on a Néel wall is equivalent to the force exerted by the effective transverse field $H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$.\n\nc. The velocity $v$ of the domain wall is related to the driving field via the domain wall mobility. Below the Walker breakdown field, the velocity is a linear function of the driving magnetic flux density (B-field). For a transverse field $B_{\\perp} = \\mu_0 H_{\\perp}$ applied to a domain wall, the velocity is given by:\n$$\nv = \\mu B_{\\perp} = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma \\Delta}{\\alpha}\\right) B_{\\perp}\n$$\nwhere the mobility $\\mu = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta}{\\alpha}$ has units of (m/s)/T.\n\nd. The damping-like SOT acts as an effective transverse field with flux density $\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$. Substituting $B_{\\perp} = \\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$ into the velocity equation gives:\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta}{\\alpha} (\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}})\n$$\ne. Substituting the previously derived expression for $\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j}{2e M_s t_F} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the steady-state domain wall velocity.\n\n**3.

The profile function $\\theta(r)$ depends only on $r$, so we denote its derivative with respect to $r$ as $\\theta'(r) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dr}$.\n\nThe derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_r\\mathbf{m} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{m}}{\\partial\\theta} = \\theta'(r) \\big( \\cos\\theta(r)\\cos\\varphi, \\cos\\theta(r)\\sin\\varphi, -\\sin\\theta(r) \\big)\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to $\\varphi$ is:\n$$\n\\partial_\\varphi\\mathbf{m} = \\big( -\\sin\\theta(r)\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta(r)\\cos\\varphi, 0 \\big)\n$$\nNext, we compute the cross product $\\partial_r\\mathbf{m} \\times \\partial_\\varphi\\mathbf{m}$:\n$$\n\\partial_r\\mathbf{m} \\times \\partial_\\varphi\\mathbf{m} = \\theta'(r)\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} & \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} & \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\\\\n\\cos\\theta\\cos\\varphi & \\cos\\theta\\sin\\varphi & -\\sin\\theta \\\\\n-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi & \\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta'(r) \\big[ (\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\varphi)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} + (\\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\varphi)\\mathbf{\\hat{j}} + (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta(\\cos^2\\varphi + \\sin^2\\varphi))\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\big]\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta'(r) \\big( \\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\varphi, \\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\varphi, \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\big)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the scalar triple product by taking the dot product with $\\mathbf{m}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{m} \\cdot (\\partial_r\\mathbf{m} \\times \\partial_\\varphi\\mathbf{m}) = \\theta'(r) \\big[ (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi)(\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\varphi) + (\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi)(\\sin^2\\theta\\sin\\varphi) + (\\cos\\theta)(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta) \\big]\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta'(r) \\big[ \\sin^3\\theta\\cos^2\\varphi + \\sin^3\\theta\\sin^2\\varphi + \\sin\\theta\\cos^2\\theta \\big]\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta'(r) \\big[ \\sin^3\\theta(\\cos^2\\varphi + \\sin^2\\varphi) + \\sin\\theta\\cos^2\\theta \\big]\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta'(r) \\big[ \\sin^3\\theta + \\sin\\theta\\cos^2\\theta \\big] = \\theta'(r)\\sin\\theta(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n= \\theta'(r)\\sin\\theta(r)\n$$\nThe integrand simplifies significantly.

The differential is $d\\theta = \\frac{d\\theta}{dr}dr$. The limits of integration are determined by the boundary conditions for $\\theta(r)$:\nAs $r \\to 0$, $\\theta \\to \\theta(0) = \\pi$.\nAs $r \\to \\infty$, $\\theta \\to \\theta(\\infty) = 0$.\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\theta(0)}^{\\theta(\\infty)} \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\pi}^{0} \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta\n$$\nEvaluating this definite integral:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\big[ -\\cos\\theta \\big]_{\\pi}^{0}\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( (-\\cos(0)) - (-\\cos(\\pi)) \\big)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -1 - (-(-1)) \\big) = \\frac{1}{2} (-1 - 1)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1\n$$\nThis result depends only on the boundary values of $\\theta(r)$ at the origin and at infinity, not on the specific functional form of the skyrmion profile $\\theta(r)$, confirming its topological nature. For the given boundary conditions, the topological charge is indeed $-1$.",
