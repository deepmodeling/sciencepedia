Analytical Derivation\n\n#### a) Effective Damping-Like Field ($B_{\\mathrm{DL}} = \\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$)\nA charge current density $\\mathbf{j} = j \\hat{x}$ in the heavy metal generates a transverse spin current density $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{spin}}$ via the Spin Hall Effect (SHE), which is injected into the ferromagnet. The magnitude of the spin current density (in units of angular momentum per area per time) is given by:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{spin}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e} j_s = \\frac{\\hbar \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j}{2e}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}$ is the spin Hall angle, and $j_s = \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j$ is the magnitude of the spin charge current.\n\nAssuming this spin current is absorbed uniformly across the ferromagnetic layer of thickness $t_F$, it exerts a torque density (torque per unit volume) on the magnetization. The magnitude of this damping-like torque density is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{DL}} = \\frac{J_{\\text{spin}}}{t_F} = \\frac{\\hbar \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j}{2e t_F}\n$$\nIn the LLG formalism, this torque is phenomenologically described by an effective magnetic field, $H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$. The torque term is $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{DL}} \\propto \\mathbf{M} \\times (\\mathbf{M} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$, and its strength is related to $H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$ by equating the prefactors from the microscopic and phenomenological forms. This leads to the standard expression for the effective field magnitude:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}} j}{2e M_s t_F}\n$$\n\n#### b) Steady-State Domain Wall Velocity ($v$)\nIn the one-dimensional collective-coordinate model for a rigid domain wall, the driving force from the SOT is balanced by the dissipative force from Gilbert damping. For a Néel wall, the damping-like SOT acts as an effective transverse magnetic field $H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$. The steady-state velocity $v$ of the wall is linearly proportional to the driving field. The standard formula derived from the 1D model is:\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta}{\\alpha} B_{\\mathrm{drive}}\n$$\nwhere $B_{\\mathrm{drive}} = \\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{drive}}$ is the driving field in Tesla, $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}T^{-1}}$, $\\Delta$ is the wall width parameter, and $\\alpha$ is the Gilbert damping.\nIn our case, the driving field is $B_{\\mathrm{DL}} = \\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}}$. Therefore, the velocity is:\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta}{\\alpha} (\\mu_0 H_{\\mathrm{DL}})\n$$\n\n### 2.
