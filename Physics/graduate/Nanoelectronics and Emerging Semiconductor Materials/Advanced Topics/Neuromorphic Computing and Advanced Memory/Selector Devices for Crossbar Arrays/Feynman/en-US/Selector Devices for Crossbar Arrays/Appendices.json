This foundational exercise guides you through a worst-case analysis of a crossbar array, using basic circuit laws to derive the minimum selector nonlinearity, $S$, required to maintain a reliable read margin .

            "problem": "Consider an idealized square crossbar array of size $N \\times N$ implemented with two-terminal memory devices in series with nonlinear selector devices at each cross-point. Each memory device is modeled as a linear resistor that can be in either the low-resistance state $R_{\\text{ON}}$ or the high-resistance state $R_{\\text{OFF}}$. Each selector device is modeled by a nonlinear two-terminal current-voltage characteristic so that the series branch current at an applied branch voltage $V$ is denoted $I(V)$. Define the selector nonlinearity metric as $S = I(V_{\\text{read}})/I(V_{\\text{half}})$, where $V_{\\text{half}} = V_{\\text{read}}/2$.\n\nAssume the standard half-bias read scheme: the selected word line is driven to $+V_{\\text{read}}$, the selected bit line is held at $0$, and all unselected word lines and bit lines are held at $+V_{\\text{read}}/2$. Assume ideal interconnects with zero line resistance and perfect voltage sources that pin the line potentials. The selected cell is in the low-resistance state $R_{\\text{ON}}$. For worst-case sneak-path analysis, assume all other cells along the selected bit line (except the selected cell) are in $R_{\\text{ON}}$. Cells not on the selected bit line are arbitrary but remain biased according to the described scheme.\n\nUsing Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Ohm’s law, determine the minimum selector nonlinearity $S$ required to ensure that the total sneak current entering the selected bit line from all half-selected cells is strictly less than one tenth of the selected-cell current. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression. If your result is independent of $R_{\\text{ON}}$ and $R_{\\text{OFF}}$ under the stated assumptions, show this explicitly. No numerical values are provided; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum selector nonlinearity, $S$, required to ensure that the total sneak current is less than one-tenth of the selected cell's current in an $N \\times N$ crossbar array under a half-bias read scheme.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the voltages and currents within the array based on the provided half-bias scheme. Let the selected cell be at the intersection of word line $i$ and bit line $j$.\n\nThe applied voltages are:\n-   Selected word line ($WL_i$): $V_{WL,sel} = +V_{\\text{read}}$\n-   Selected bit line ($BL_j$): $V_{BL,sel} = 0$\n-   Unselected word lines ($WL_{k \\neq i}$): $V_{WL,unsel} = +V_{\\text{read}}/2$\n-   Unselected bit lines ($BL_{l \\neq j}$): $V_{BL,unsel} = +V_{\\text{read}}/2$\n\nThe voltage $V$ across any cell at the intersection of a word line $WL_a$ and a bit line $BL_b$ is given by the difference in potential, $V = V_{WL,a} - V_{BL,b}$.\n\nWe now analyze the voltage across and current through the different types of cells in the array. The problem states that the current through a series branch (memory element + selector) is given by a function $I(V)$, where $V$ is the voltage across the branch. This function implicitly depends on the state of the memory element, $R_{\\text{ON}}$ or $R_{\\text{OFF}}$. Let's denote the current for an ON-state cell as $I_{\\text{ON}}(V)$ and for an OFF-state cell as $I_{\\text{OFF}}(V)$.\n\n1.  **The Selected Cell:**\n    The selected cell is at $(i, j)$. The voltage across it is:\n    $$V_{\\text{selected}} = V_{WL,sel} - V_{BL,sel} = V_{\\text{read}} - 0 = V_{\\text{read}}$$\n    The problem specifies that the selected cell is in the low-resistance state, $R_{\\text{ON}}$. Therefore, the current through the selected cell is:\n    $$I_{\\text{selected}} = I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{read}})$$\n    This is the desired signal current that we are trying to read.\n\n2.  **Sneak Path Analysis:**\n    The total sneak current is the sum of all unwanted currents that flow into the selected bit line, $BL_j$. The potential of $BL_j$ is held at $0$. Currents can enter $BL_j$ from cells connected to it at unselected word lines $WL_{k \\neq i}$. There are $N-1$ such word lines.\n\n    Consider a cell at the intersection of an unselected word line $WL_k$ (where $k \\neq i$) and the selected bit line $BL_j$. The voltage across this cell is:\n    $$V_{\\text{sneak}} = V_{WL,unsel} - V_{BL,sel} = \\frac{V_{\\text{read}}}{2} - 0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{read}}}{2}$$\n    The problem defines $V_{\\text{half}} = V_{\\text{read}}/2$, so the voltage across these cells is $V_{\\text{half}}$. These cells are referred to as half-selected.\n\n    For the worst-case sneak path analysis on the selected bit line, we must assume a scenario that maximizes the sneak current. This occurs when the impedance of the sneak paths is minimal. The problem explicitly states this assumption: \"all other cells along the selected bit line ... are in $R_{\\text{ON}}$\".\n\n    Thus, the current through each of these $N-1$ half-selected cells on the selected bit line is $I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{half}})$.\n    The total sneak current, $I_{\\text{sneak,total}}$, entering the selected bit line is the sum of the currents from these $N-1$ cells:\n    $$I_{\\text{sneak,total}} = \\sum_{k=1, k \\neq i}^{N} I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{half}}) = (N-1) I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{half}})$$\n    We note that other cells in the array do not contribute current to the selected bit line. Cells on unselected bit lines ($BL_{l \\neq j}$) have currents that flow into their respective bit lines, not the selected one. Cells at the intersection of unselected word lines and unselected bit lines have zero voltage across them ($V_{\\text{read}}/2 - V_{\\text{read}}/2 = 0$) and thus contribute no current.\n\n3.  **The Condition for Minimum Nonlinearity:**\n    The problem requires that the total sneak current be strictly less than one-tenth of the selected-cell current:\n    $$I_{\\text{sneak,total}}  \\frac{1}{10} I_{\\text{selected}}$$\n    Substituting our derived expressions for the currents:\n    $$(N-1) I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{half}})  \\frac{1}{10} I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{read}})$$\n\n4.  **Applying the Nonlinearity Metric:**\n    The selector nonlinearity metric, $S$, is defined as $S = I(V_{\\text{read}})/I(V_{\\text{half}})$. In the context of reading an ON-state cell and analyzing worst-case sneak paths through other ON-state cells, this metric logically applies to the ON-state current-voltage characteristic. Thus, we have:\n    $$S = \\frac{I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{read}})}{I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{half}})}$$\n    We can rearrange our inequality to isolate this ratio:\n    $$\\frac{I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{read}})}{I_{\\text{ON}}(V_{\\text{half}})}  10(N-1)$$\n    Substituting the definition of $S$ into this inequality yields:\n    $$S  10(N-1)$$\n    The problem asks for the minimum value of $S$ required to ensure this strict inequality. For a continuous variable $S$, there is no minimum value that satisfies a strict inequality; there is only a greatest lower bound (infimum). In the context of engineering and physics problems of this nature, \"minimum required\" refers to this boundary value. Any value of $S$ greater than $10(N-1)$ will satisfy the condition. The limiting value is therefore $10(N-1)$.\n\n5.  **Dependence on Resistance States:**\n    The derivation shows that the required nonlinearity $S$ is a function only of the array size $N$. The result is independent of the specific values of $R_{\\text{ON}}$ and $R_{\\text{OFF}}$. This is because the problem's formulation abstracts the detailed physics of the series combination into a single branch current characteristic, $I(V)$. The nonlinearity $S$ is defined as a ratio of these currents, which causes the specific functional form of $I_{\\text{ON}}(V)$, and thus the value of $R_{\\text{ON}}$, to cancel out from the final inequality governing $S$. The resistance $R_{\\text{OFF}}$ does not appear at all, as the worst-case analysis for sneak current during a read operation only involves ON-state cells.\n\nThe minimum required selector nonlinearity is the value that defines the boundary for the acceptable operation region.",

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the selector nonlinearity $S$ and the read-disturb probability $P_{\\text{disturb}}$.\n\n**1. Selector Nonlinearity, $S$**\n\nThe selector nonlinearity $S$ is defined as the ratio of the ON-state current at the selected voltage $V_{T}$ to the ON-state current at the unselected half-bias voltage $V_{T}/2$.\n$$S = \\frac{I_{\\text{on}}(V_{T})}{I_{\\text{on}}(V_{T}/2)}$$\nThe ON-state current-voltage characteristic is given by the linear model $I_{\\text{on}}(V) = g_{\\text{on}}(V - V_{H})$ for $V \\geq V_{H}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the voltage across an unselected device:\n$$V_{\\text{unselected}} = \\frac{V_{T}}{2} = \\frac{1.8~\\text{V}}{2} = 0.9~\\text{V}$$\nSince $V_{\\text{unselected}} = 0.9~\\text{V}$ is greater than $V_{H} = 0.7~\\text{V}$, the ON-state model is applicable for the unselected device current calculation as per the stated conditions.\n\nThe current through a selected device (at voltage $V_{T}$) is:\n$$I_{\\text{on}}(V_{T}) = g_{\\text{on}}(V_{T} - V_{H})$$\nThe current through an unselected device (at voltage $V_{T}/2$) is:\n$$I_{\\text{on}}(V_{T}/2) = g_{\\text{on}}\\left(\\frac{V_{T}}{2} - V_{H}\\right)$$\nThe nonlinearity $S$ is the ratio of these two currents. The term $g_{\\text{on}}$ cancels out:\n$$S = \\frac{g_{\\text{on}}(V_{T} - V_{H})}{g_{\\text{on}}\\left(\\frac{V_{T}}{2} - V_{H}\\right)} = \\frac{V_{T} - V_{H}}{\\frac{V_{T}}{2} - V_{H}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$S = \\frac{1.8 - 0.7}{\\frac{1.8}{2} - 0.7} = \\frac{1.1}{0.9 - 0.7} = \\frac{1.1}{0.2} = 5.5$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $S = 5.50$.\n\n**2. Read-Disturb Probability, $P_{\\text{disturb}}$**\n\nThe probability of a stochastic event with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$ occurring within a time interval $t$ is given by $P(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. In this problem, an OFF-state device is subjected to a constant read voltage $V_{\\text{read}}$ for a duration $t_r$. The hazard rate $\\lambda(V_{\\text{read}})$ is therefore constant during the pulse.\nThe read-disturb probability is:\n$$P_{\\text{disturb}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda(V_{\\text{read}}) \\cdot t_{r})$$\nThe hazard rate $\\lambda(V)$ is given by the Arrhenius model:\n$$\\lambda(V) = f_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(V)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nwhere the activation barrier $U(V)$ is given by:\n$$U(V) = E_{a}\\left(1 - \\frac{V}{V_{T}}\\right)$$\nWe first calculate the necessary components for $V=V_{\\text{read}}$.\nThe thermal energy $k_{B}T$, using the Boltzmann constant $k_{B} \\approx 8.61733 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}$:\n$$k_{B}T = (8.61733 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (330~\\text{K}) \\approx 0.028437~\\text{eV}$$\nThe activation barrier at the read voltage $V_{\\text{read}} = 1.2~\\text{V}$:\n$$U(V_{\\text{read}}) = E_{a}\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{\\text{read}}}{V_{T}}\\right) = (2.1~\\text{eV})\\left(1 - \\frac{1.2~\\text{V}}{1.8~\\text{V}}\\right) = (2.1~\\text{eV})\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = (2.1~\\text{eV})\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 0.7~\\text{eV}$$\nNow we can compute the exponent in the hazard rate expression:\n$$\\frac{U(V_{\\text{read}})}{k_{B}T} = \\frac{0.7~\\text{eV}}{0.028437~\\text{eV}} \\approx 24.6158$$\nNext, we calculate the hazard rate $\\lambda(V_{\\text{read}})$:\n$$\\lambda(V_{\\text{read}}) = (5.0 \\times 10^{12}~\\text{s}^{-1}) \\exp(-24.6158) \\approx (5.0 \\times 10^{12}~\\text{s}^{-1})(2.0487 \\times 10^{-11}) \\approx 102.435~\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe argument of the exponential for the probability calculation is $\\lambda(V_{\\text{read}}) \\cdot t_{r}$:\n$$\\lambda(V_{\\text{read}}) \\cdot t_{r} = (102.435~\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-7}~\\text{s}) \\approx 1.02435 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nSince this value is much less than $1$, the probability can be accurately approximated by $P_{\\text{disturb}} \\approx \\lambda(V_{\\text{read}}) \\cdot t_{r}$. However, we will compute the exact value from the formula.\n$$P_{\\text{disturb}} = 1 - \\exp(-1.02435 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 1.02430 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the read-disturb probability is $1.02 \\times 10^{-5}$.",

With $\\exp(10)\\approx 2.202646579\\times 10^{4}$ and $\\exp(3.5)\\approx 33.11545196$, we obtain\n$$\n\\exp(13.5)\\approx 2.202646579\\times 10^{4}\\times 33.11545196 \\approx 7.29416369\\times 10^{5}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{off}}(V_{\\mathrm{th,on}})\\approx 1.0\\times 10^{-12}\\times 7.29416369\\times 10^{5} = 7.29416369\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{A}.\n$$\nThe corresponding load drop is\n$$\nR_{L}\\, I_{\\mathrm{off}}(V_{\\mathrm{th,on}}) = 1000\\times 7.29416369\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 7.29416369\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nV_{s,\\mathrm{high}} \\approx 0.9 + 7.29416369\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.900729416369\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the minimum practical applied source voltage $V_{s,\\mathrm{low}}$ that yields a measurable off-state current at or above the noise floor while staying in the off-state. We enforce $I_{\\mathrm{off}}(V_{\\mathrm{low}})=I_{\\min}$ to find the corresponding device voltage $V_{\\mathrm{low}}$; then we add the series drop $I_{\\min} R_{L}$ to obtain $V_{s,\\mathrm{low}}$. Solve\n$$\nI_{\\min} = I_{0}\\exp(\\alpha V_{\\mathrm{low}}) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\exp(\\alpha V_{\\mathrm{low}})=\\frac{I_{\\min}}{I_{0}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad V_{\\mathrm{low}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{I_{\\min}}{I_{0}}\\right).\n$$\nWith $I_{\\min}=1.0\\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{A}$ and $I_{0}=1.0\\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A}$,\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\min}}{I_{0}}=10^{4}, \\quad \\ln\\!\\left(10^{4}\\right)=4\\ln(10)\\approx 4\\times 2.302585093\\approx 9.210340372,\n$$\ngiving\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{low}}=\\frac{9.210340372}{15}\\ \\mathrm{V}\\approx 0.614022691\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\nThe source voltage at this operating point includes the load drop $I_{\\min} R_{L}$:\n$$\nV_{s,\\mathrm{low}} = V_{\\mathrm{low}} + I_{\\min} R_{L} = 0.614022691\\ \\mathrm{V} + \\left(1.0\\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{A}\\right)\\times \\left(1000\\ \\Omega\\right) = 0.614022691\\ \\mathrm{V} + 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.614032691\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$\n\nWe now verify that maximizing the selector nonlinearity $S$ under the safety constraint indeed chooses $V_{s,\\mathrm{high}}$. By definition,\n$$\nS(V)=\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{off}}(V)}{I_{\\mathrm{off}}(V/2)}=\\frac{I_{0}\\exp(\\alpha V)}{I_{0}\\exp(\\alpha V/2)}=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha V}{2}\\right).\n$$\nThus $S(V)$ is strictly increasing in the device voltage $V$. Under the stability constraint $R_{L}\\beta$, crossing into the NDR region would latch; therefore the maximum permissible device voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{th,on}}$ from below, and the corresponding maximum safe applied source voltage is $V_{s,\\mathrm{high}}$ as computed above. Hence, the safe read window that avoids latching while maximizing $S$ is the applied source voltage interval $\\big(V_{s,\\mathrm{low}},V_{s,\\mathrm{high}}\\big)$ computed from the off-state branch.\n\nFinally, round both boundaries to four significant figures and report in volts:\n$$\nV_{s,\\mathrm{low}}\\approx 0.6140\\ \\mathrm{V}, \\quad V_{s,\\mathrm{high}}\\approx 0.9007\\ \\mathrm{V}.\n$$",
