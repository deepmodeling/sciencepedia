            "problem": "A two-terminal Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) device based on titanium dioxide $\\text{TiO}_2$ can be modeled as a nanoscale metal–insulator–metal stack of thickness $D$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$, in which oxygen vacancy migration creates a bilayer structure: a highly doped, oxygen-deficient region $\\text{TiO}_{2-x}$ of width $w(t)$ with low resistivity and an undoped region of width $D - w(t)$ with high resistivity. Electrons carry the external circuit current $i(t)$ through the stack, while oxygen vacancies drift inside the solid in response to the internal electric field. The boundary between the two regions is assumed to move with the local vacancy drift velocity. Use the following foundational relations:\n- Drift motion: the average drift velocity of mobile ions (oxygen vacancies) satisfies $v_{d} = \\mu_{v} E$, where $\\mu_{v}$ is the vacancy mobility and $E$ is the local electric field.\n- Ohm’s law in a uniform medium: $J = \\sigma E$, and the resistance of a uniform slab of length $L$ and cross-section $A$ is $R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$, where $\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}$.\n- Series conduction through the two regions implies the same $i(t)$ flows through both subregions.\n\nDefine $R_{ON}$ as the resistance that would be measured if the entire film of thickness $D$ were in the low-resistivity state, so that $R_{ON} := \\rho_{ON} \\frac{D}{A}$, and $R_{OFF}$ analogously for the high-resistivity state. Starting from these fundamentals and the geometric partition of the film, derive the governing relation for the rate of change of $w(t)$ driven solely by ionic drift. Explicitly express the drift-induced rate $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ in terms of $\\mu_{v}$, $R_{ON}$, $D$, and $i(t)$, based on a physically consistent field in the doped region and the linkage between electronic current and internal electric field.\n\nIn addition, enumerate the minimal set of modeling approximations that are required to obtain a strictly linear relation in the current $i(t)$ for the boundary motion, specifically addressing field uniformity, material parameters, transport mechanisms, geometry, and any neglected effects.\n\nProvide, as your final answer, a single closed-form algebraic expression for the drift-induced $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ written only in terms of $\\mu_{v}$, $R_{ON}$, $D$, and $i(t)$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the rate of change of the width of the conductive region, $w(t)$, in a simplified model of a two-terminal RRAM device. The derivation must be based on the provided physical principles and definitions.\n\nThe fundamental assumption stated in the problem is that the boundary at $x=w(t)$ between the doped ($\\text{TiO}_{2-x}$) and undoped ($\\text{TiO}_2$) regions moves with the local drift velocity of the mobile oxygen vacancies, $v_d$. The rate of change of the boundary position is therefore equal to this velocity:\n$$\n\\frac{dw(t)}{dt} = v_d\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the constitutive relation for ionic drift: $v_d = \\mu_v E$, where $\\mu_v$ is the vacancy mobility and $E$ is the local electric field driving the drift. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dw(t)}{dt} = \\mu_v E\n$$\n\nThe crucial step is to determine the relevant electric field, $E$. The problem specifies that the derivation should be \"based on a physically consistent field in the doped region\". This instructs us to use the electric field within the low-resistivity, doped region of width $w(t)$, which we denote as $E_{ON}$. The oxygen vacancies are being driven through this conductive medium, causing its boundary to extend or retract.\n$$\n\\frac{dw(t)}{dt} = \\mu_v E_{ON}\n$$\n\nNext, we relate the electric field $E_{ON}$ to the electronic current $i(t)$ flowing through the device. The problem provides Ohm's law in a uniform medium in its local form, $J = \\sigma E$. Here, $J$ is the current density and $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity. In the doped region, the conductivity is $\\sigma_{ON}$, which is the reciprocal of the resistivity, $\\rho_{ON}$.\n$$\nJ_{ON} = \\sigma_{ON} E_{ON} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{ON}} E_{ON}\n$$\n\nThe current density $J_{ON}$ is the total current $i(t)$ flowing through the device divided by its uniform cross-sectional area, $A$. This is based on the assumption of uniform current flow across the device area.\n$$\nJ_{ON} = \\frac{i(t)}{A}\n$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $J_{ON}$, we can solve for the electric field $E_{ON}$ in the doped region:\n$$\n\\frac{i(t)}{A} = \\frac{E_{ON}}{\\rho_{ON}} \\implies E_{ON} = \\rho_{ON} \\frac{i(t)}{A}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $E_{ON}$ back into the equation for the rate of change of $w(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dw(t)}{dt} = \\mu_v \\left( \\rho_{ON} \\frac{i(t)}{A} \\right) = \\mu_v \\frac{\\rho_{ON}}{A} i(t)\n$$\n\nThe final step is to express this result in terms of the given parameter $R_{ON}$. The problem defines $R_{ON}$ as the resistance of the device if the entire film were in the low-resistivity state: $R_{ON} := \\rho_{ON} \\frac{D}{A}$. We can rearrange this definition to find an expression for the term $\\frac{\\rho_{ON}}{A}$ that appears in our equation for $\\frac{dw}{dt}$:\n$$\nR_{ON} = \\rho_{ON} \\frac{D}{A} \\implies \\frac{\\rho_{ON}}{A} = \\frac{R_{ON}}{D}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into our equation yields the final governing relation for the drift-induced boundary motion:\n$$\n\\frac{dw(t)}{dt} = \\mu_v \\left( \\frac{R_{ON}}{D} \\right) i(t)\n$$\nThis expression gives the rate of change of the conductive region's width solely in terms of the specified variables $\\mu_v$, $R_{ON}$, $D$, and the instantaneous current $i(t)$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the minimal set of modeling approximations required to obtain this strictly linear relationship between $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ and $i(t)$. The derivation above rested on several key simplifying assumptions:\n\n1.  **Field and Geometry:**\n    *   The model assumes a one-dimensional geometry where the electric field and current density are uniform across the cross-sectional area $A$.\n    *   The electric field $E_{ON}$ is assumed to be uniform throughout the entire doped region of width $w(t)$. This neglects space charge effects or non-uniformities in doping concentration that would lead to a position-dependent field.\n    *   The boundary between the doped and undoped regions is an idealized, sharp, planar interface.\n\n2.  **Material Parameters:**\n    *   The mobility of oxygen vacancies, $\\mu_v$, is treated as a constant. In reality, mobility is a strong function of temperature and can also depend on the electric field strength, which would introduce non-linearity.\n    *   The resistivity of the doped region, $\\rho_{ON}$, is assumed to be a constant, independent of local vacancy concentration, temperature, or field strength.\n\n3.  **Transport Mechanisms:**\n    *   Ionic motion is exclusively due to drift, described by the linear relation $v_d = \\mu_v E$. This is valid only for low fields. Non-linearities in drift velocity at high fields are ignored.\n    *   Diffusion of vacancies, which would be driven by concentration gradients and contribute a term proportional to the second spatial derivative of the concentration, is neglected.\n    *   The electronic conduction mechanism is purely ohmic ($J = \\sigma E$). Non-ohmic mechanisms like tunneling or Poole-Frenkel emission are not considered.\n\n4.  **Neglected Physical Effects:**\n    *   Joule heating is ignored. The current $i(t)$ generates heat, which would raise the device temperature. Since vacancy mobility $\\mu_v$ is typically thermally activated (Arrhenius-like dependence), this creates a strong non-linear feedback loop between the current and the rate of boundary motion. Assuming an isothermal system is critical for linearity.\n    *   The model decouples the boundary dynamics from the high-resistivity region. The determination of $\\frac{dw}{dt}$ relies only on the field in the conductive region, $E_{ON}$. A more complex model might consider the field in the insulating region, $E_{OFF}$, or the field right at the interface, which would depend on the properties of both regions and make the dynamics non-linear with respect to current $i(t)$ because the total resistance depends on $w(t)$.",

Coefficient of Variation, $\\mathrm{CV}_G$**\n\nNow we can compute the coefficient of variation.\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_G = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(G)}}{\\mathbb{E}[G]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda_M (\\sigma_g^2 + \\mu_g^2)}}{\\lambda_M \\mu_g}$$\nFor the case where $\\mathbb{E}[M] = \\lambda_M > 0$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_G = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda_M}\\sqrt{\\sigma_g^2 + \\mu_g^2}}{\\lambda_M \\mu_g} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_M}} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sigma_g^2 + \\mu_g^2}}{\\mu_g}$$\nThis can also be written in terms of the coefficient of variation of a single filament, $\\mathrm{CV}_g = \\sigma_g/\\mu_g$:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_G = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[M]}} \\sqrt{1 + \\mathrm{CV}_g^2}$$\nAs per the problem statement, if $\\mathbb{E}[M] = \\lambda_M = 0$, the conductance $G$ is identically $0$, so $\\mathbb{E}[G]=0$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(G)=0$. The coefficient of variation becomes an indeterminate $0/0$ form. The problem provides the specific definition that in this case, $\\mathrm{CV}_G$ is to be taken as infinite. This is consistent with the derived formula, as the denominator $\\sqrt{\\lambda_M}$ approaches $0$.\n\nThe formulas derived above are sufficient to implement the required program.",
