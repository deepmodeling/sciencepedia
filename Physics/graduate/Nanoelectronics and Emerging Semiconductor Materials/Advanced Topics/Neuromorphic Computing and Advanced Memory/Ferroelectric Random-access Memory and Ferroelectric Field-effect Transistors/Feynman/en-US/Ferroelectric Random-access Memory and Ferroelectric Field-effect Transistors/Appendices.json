The device is an n-channel FeFET, which can be modeled as a metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor (MFS) capacitor.

Each device has an intrinsic threshold voltage $V_{th,0}$ and a remanent polarization $P_r$ that induces bound charge density at the gate interface. The ferroelectric contribution shifts the effective threshold voltage according to the capacitor relation, where bound charge density modifies the gate potential via an effective gate capacitance per unit area $C_{ox}$. Treating the ferroelectric bound charge density as a sheet charge of magnitude $P_r$ and using the capacitor relation $Q = C V$ with $Q = P_r$ per unit area, the polarization-induced threshold shift has magnitude $|P_r|/C_{ox}$. The sign depends on the stored bit: define bit $1$ to correspond to a polarization orientation that lowers the threshold and bit $0$ to correspond to a polarization orientation that raises the threshold. The readout uses a comparator at a fixed decision voltage $V_{cmp}$ that classifies the device as storing bit $1$ if the measured effective threshold is less than or equal to $V_{cmp}$, and bit $0$ otherwise.

With the charge per unit area $Q$ being $P_r$, the shift is $P_r/C_{ox}$.\n\nLet us define the random variable $\\Delta V_P = P_r/C_{ox}$.

The word is uncorrectable if the number of errors $k$ is greater than $t$. The word failure probability, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}$, is thus:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}(t) = P(k > t) = \\sum_{k=t+1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThis is the survival function of the binomial distribution. The first task is to find the minimal integer $t \\ge 0$ such that this probability is less than or equal to the target word failure probability, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$ \\text{Find minimal integer } t \\text{ such that } \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}(t) \\le \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{target}} $$\nThis is found by iterating $t$ from $0, 1, 2, \\dots$ and calculating $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}(t)$ until the condition is met. The corresponding value of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}(t)$ is the final reported word failure probability.\n\nThe second task is to find the minimum number of redundancy bits, $r$, required to construct a code that can correct up to $t$ errors for a word of length $n$. The sphere-packing bound (or Hamming bound) gives a lower limit on $r$. It states that a code must have enough redundancy to uniquely identify every possible error pattern it is designed to correct. For a binary code of length $n$ that corrects up to $t$ errors, the $2^r$ redundant states must be able to distinguish the error patterns for each of the $2^{n-r}$ valid codewords. The number of error patterns of weight $i$ is $\\binom{n}{i}$. Thus, for each codeword, we must be able to identify all error patterns up to weight $t$. The bound is:\n$$ 2^r \\ge \\sum_{i=0}^{t} \\binom{n}{i} $$\nTo find the minimal integer $r$, we first compute the volume of the Hamming ball $V(n,t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{t} \\binom{n}{i}$, and then solve for $r$:\n$$ r \\ge \\log_2(V(n,t)) $$\nThe minimal integer $r$ is therefore:\n$$ r = \\lceil \\log_2(V(n,t)) \\rceil $$\nwhere $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$ is the ceiling function. For numerical stability with large $n$ and $t$, the sum for $V(n,t)$ is best computed in the log domain using `logsumexp` and `gammaln` functions.\n\n**Part 3: Computational Procedure**\n\nThe final output is a list of results for each test case. The overall procedure for each case is:\n1. Calculate the effective standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n2. Calculate the arguments of the CDF $\\Phi$ for $P(\\text{error}_0)$ and $P(\\text{error}_1)$.\n3. Compute the BER, $p$, using the formula derived in Part 1. Special care is taken for very small probabilities using logarithmic representations to maintain numerical precision.\n4. Search for the minimal integer $t$ by evaluating $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}(t)$ for $t=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ until $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}(t) \\le \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{target}}$. The final $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}$ is this value.\n5. Compute the sum $V(n,t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{t} \\binom{n}{i}$.\n6. Calculate the minimal integer redundancy $r = \\lceil \\log_2(V(n,t)) \\rceil$.\n7. Collate the four computed values: $[\\text{BER}, r, t, \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{word}}]$.\n\nThe following program implements this procedure.",
