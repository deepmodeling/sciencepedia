            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary physical models, equations, and parameters to compute a unique and meaningful solution. The problem requires the development of a computational model for the effective charge carrier mobility in a polycrystalline semiconductor film, accounting for temperature- and time-dependent grain growth and defect passivation during an annealing process.\n\nThe solution is constructed by systematically applying the provided physical relations. The effective mobility, $\\mu_{eff}(T,t)$, for an anneal temperature $T$ and anneal time $t$, is determined by combining the grain boundary limited mobility, $\\mu_{gb}(T,t)$, and the intrinsic bulk mobility, $\\mu_{bulk}(T_{op})$, using Matthiessen's rule. The calculation proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we define all constants and parameters provided.

The provided relation for the substrate response is in the Fourier domain: $\\hat{p}(k) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{E}_s k \\hat{w}(k)$. For a single sinusoidal mode of deflection $w(x) = A \\cos(kx)$, this relationship transforms directly into real space as the substrate acts like a linear foundation with a wavenumber-dependent stiffness. The traction $p(x)$ is a restoring force, so for an upward deflection $w(x)>0$, the traction is downward, $p(x)<0$. The relation is:\n$$p(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{E}_s k w(x)$$\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$D_f \\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} + N \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{E}_s k w(x) = 0$$\nWe now substitute the assumed sinusoidal deflection profile $w(x) = A\\cos(kx)$:\n$$\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -k^2 A\\cos(kx) = -k^2 w(x)$$\n$$\\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = k^4 A\\cos(kx) = k^4 w(x)$$\nThe equilibrium equation becomes:\n$$D_f (k^4 w) + N (-k^2 w) + \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{E}_s k w = 0$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($w \\neq 0$), the coefficients must sum to zero:\n$$D_f k^4 - N k^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{E}_s k = 0$$\nSince wrinkling requires a non-zero wavenumber ($k > 0$), we can divide by $k$:\n$$D_f k^3 - N k + \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{E}_s = 0$$\nThis equation gives the required compressive force $N$ to sustain a wrinkle pattern of wavenumber $k$. We can solve for $N$:\n$$N(k) = D_f k^2 + \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2k}$$\nThe onset of wrinkling corresponds to the minimum possible compressive force that can induce an instability. We find this by minimizing $N(k)$ with respect to the wavenumber $k$:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dk} = 2 D_f k - \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2k^2} = 0$$\nSolving for the critical wavenumber $k_c$:\n$$4 D_f k_c^3 = \\bar{E}_s \\implies k_c = \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{4D_f}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nThe critical compressive force $N_c$ is found by substituting $k_c$ back into the expression for $N(k)$:\n$$N_c = N(k_c) = D_f k_c^2 + \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2k_c}$$\nFrom the minimization condition, we have $\\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2k_c^2} = 2 D_f k_c$, which implies $\\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2k_c} = 2 D_f k_c^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $N_c$:\n$$N_c = D_f k_c^2 + 2 D_f k_c^2 = 3 D_f k_c^2$$\nNow, we express $N_c$ in terms of the given material properties. First, substitute the expression for $k_c$:\n$$N_c = 3 D_f \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{4D_f}\\right)^{2/3} = 3 D_f^{1/3} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{4}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{3}{4^{2/3}} (D_f \\bar{E}_s^2)^{1/3}$$\nThe problem asks for the critical strain $\\epsilon_c$. Using the given plane-strain relation $N = \\bar{E}_f h \\epsilon$, we have $\\epsilon_c = \\frac{N_c}{\\bar{E}_f h}$:\n$$\\epsilon_c = \\frac{1}{\\bar{E}_f h} \\left( \\frac{3}{4^{2/3}} (D_f \\bar{E}_s^2)^{1/3} \\right)$$\nNow replace the bending stiffness $D_f$ with its definition in terms of the plane-strain modulus: $D_f = \\frac{E_f h^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2)} = \\frac{\\bar{E}_f h^3}{12}$.\n$$\\epsilon_c = \\frac{3}{4^{2/3} \\bar{E}_f h} \\left( \\frac{\\bar{E}_f h^3}{12} \\bar{E}_s^2 \\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{3}{4^{2/3} \\bar{E}_f h} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_f h^3 \\bar{E}_s^2}{12}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n$$\\epsilon_c = \\frac{3}{4^{2/3} \\bar{E}_f h} \\frac{\\bar{E}_f^{1/3} h \\bar{E}_s^{2/3}}{12^{1/3}} = \\frac{3}{4^{2/3} \\cdot 12^{1/3}} \\frac{\\bar{E}_f^{1/3}}{\\bar{E}_f} \\bar{E}_s^{2/3}$$\nSimplifying the numerical prefactor: $4^{2/3} \\cdot 12^{1/3} = (16)^{1/3} \\cdot (12)^{1/3} = (16 \\cdot 12)^{1/3} = 192^{1/3} = (64 \\cdot 3)^{1/3} = 4 \\cdot 3^{1/3}$.\n$$\\epsilon_c = \\frac{3}{4 \\cdot 3^{1/3}} \\left( \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{\\bar{E}_f} \\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{4} \\left( \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{\\bar{E}_f} \\right)^{2/3}$$\n\n**(b) Calculation of the Ratio $R$**\n\nWe need to compute the ratio $R = \\dfrac{\\epsilon_c}{\\epsilon_E(L=\\lambda_c/2)}$.\nFrom part (a), the critical force for wrinkling is $N_c = 3 D_f k_c^2$. The corresponding critical strain is $\\epsilon_c = \\dfrac{N_c}{\\bar{E}_f h} = \\dfrac{3 D_f k_c^2}{\\bar{E}_f h}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the Euler buckling strain $\\epsilon_E$ for a free-standing film of length $L = \\lambda_c/2$. The critical wavelength for wrinkling is $\\lambda_c = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_c}$. Therefore, the length of the beam for the buckling problem is $L = \\frac{\\lambda_c}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{k_c}$.\n\nThe Euler buckling load for a pinned-pinned beam of length $L$ is given as $N_E(L) = \\dfrac{\\pi^2 D_f}{L^2}$. Substituting $L = \\pi/k_c$:\n$$N_E(L=\\lambda_c/2) = \\frac{\\pi^2 D_f}{(\\pi/k_c)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 D_f}{\\pi^2/k_c^2} = D_f k_c^2$$\nThe corresponding Euler buckling strain $\\epsilon_E$ is obtained using the same force-strain relation:\n$$\\epsilon_E(L=\\lambda_c/2) = \\frac{N_E(L=\\lambda_c/2)}{\\bar{E}_f h} = \\frac{D_f k_c^2}{\\bar{E}_f h}$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\epsilon_c}{\\epsilon_E(L=\\lambda_c/2)} = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{3 D_f k_c^2}{\\bar{E}_f h}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{D_f k_c^2}{\\bar{E}_f h}\\right)}$$\nAll terms cancel except for the numerical factor:\n$$R = 3$$\nThis result signifies that the elastic substrate provides a significant stabilizing effect. The strain required to wrinkle the film is precisely three times the strain required to buckle a free-standing film segment whose length is one half of the natural wrinkling wavelength.",

We can see that the term $B$ will be dominant, so we expect $B$ to be slightly less than $1201.43\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nLet's use an iterative approach. A first approximation is $B_0 \\approx 1201.43$.\nThe correction term is $-0.10 \\ln(B_0) \\approx -0.10 \\ln(1201.43) \\approx -0.10(7.09) = -0.709$.\nA better approximation is $B_1 \\approx 1201.43 - 0.709 = 1200.72\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nLet's verify this value:\n$1200.72 + 0.10 \\ln(1200.72) = 1200.72 + 0.10(7.0906) \\approx 1200.72 + 0.709 = 1201.429$, which is very close to the target value of $1201.43$.\nThus, the required bandwidth is $B \\approx 1200.7\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$B \\approx 1.20 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$",
