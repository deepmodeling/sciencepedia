It describes a standard, idealized model for moiré superlattices which is fundamental to the study of twisted and strained bilayer systems in condensed matter physics and nanoelectronics. The provided principles are correct statements relating real-space and reciprocal-space lattices. The problem is formalizable and requires a rigorous application of vector algebra and lattice concepts. No flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions are present.\n\nWe will proceed with a step-by-step derivation for the square and hexagonal lattices, and then compare the results to find the common expression for the moiré period.\n\n**Part (a) and (b): Square Lattice**\n\nThe primitive real-space vectors for Layer A (the unstrained square lattice) are given as $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\nAccording to the provided principle (i), the corresponding primitive reciprocal-space vectors, which we will denote as $\\{\\mathbf{b}_{i}\\}$, must satisfy the condition $\\mathbf{a}_{i}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j}=2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$:\n$\\mathbf{a}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = 2\\pi \\implies (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}})\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = 2\\pi$\n$\\mathbf{a}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = 0 \\implies (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = 0$\nThese two conditions uniquely determine $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$:\n$\\mathbf{a}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = 0 \\implies (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}})\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = 0$\n$\\mathbf{a}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = 2\\pi \\implies (a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = 2\\pi$\nThese two conditions uniquely determine $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\nSo, for Layer A, the primitive reciprocal vectors are $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nLayer B is an identical lattice subjected to a uniform, isotropic dilation by a factor of $\\lambda = 1+\\epsilon$. According to principle (ii), its reciprocal lattice vectors, denoted $\\{\\mathbf{b}'_{i}\\}$, are scaled by a factor of $1/\\lambda$ with directions preserved:\n$\\mathbf{b}'_{1} = \\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a(1+\\epsilon)}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$\n$\\mathbf{b}'_{2} = \\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a(1+\\epsilon)}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n\nAccording to principle (iii), the primitive moiré reciprocal vectors, $\\{\\mathbf{G}_{M,i}\\}$, are the differences between the nearly coincident reciprocal vectors of the two layers. For the unrotated case, these are the differences between corresponding primitive vectors:\n$\\mathbf{G}_{M,1} = \\mathbf{b}'_{1} - \\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon} - 1\\right)\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{1 - (1+\\epsilon)}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{1} = -\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{1} = -\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$\n$\\mathbf{G}_{M,2} = \\mathbf{b}'_{2} - \\mathbf{b}_{2} = -\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{2} = -\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n\nThe orientation of the moiré fringes is perpendicular to the corresponding moiré reciprocal vectors. Since $\\mathbf{G}_{M,1}$ is parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{G}_{M,2}$ is parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, the moiré pattern forms a square superlattice that is aligned with the underlying crystal lattices. Fringes associated with spatial frequency $\\mathbf{G}_{M,1}$ run parallel to the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$-axis, and fringes associated with $\\mathbf{G}_{M,2}$ run parallel to the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$-axis.\n\nThe real-space moiré lattice vectors, $\\{\\mathbf{A}_{M,i}\\}$, define the periodicity of the superlattice. They have a reciprocal relationship with the moiré reciprocal vectors: $\\mathbf{A}_{M,i}\\cdot \\mathbf{G}_{M,j}=2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$. The moiré period along a principal direction is the magnitude of the corresponding moiré lattice vector.\nSince $\\mathbf{G}_{M,i} = -\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{i}$, we can find $\\mathbf{A}_{M,i}$ by assuming it is proportional to $\\mathbf{a}_{i}$, such that $\\mathbf{A}_{M,i} = C\\mathbf{a}_{i}$.\nSubstituting into the reciprocity condition for $i=j$:\n$(C\\mathbf{a}_{i})\\cdot\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{i}\\right) = 2\\pi$\n$C \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\right) (\\mathbf{a}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}_{i}) = 2\\pi$\n$C \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\right) (2\\pi) = 2\\pi$\n$C = -\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$\nThus, the real-space moiré vectors are $\\mathbf{A}_{M,i} = -\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{a}_{i}$.\n\nThe moiré period for the square lattice, $L_{\\mathrm{sqr}}(\\epsilon)$, is the magnitude of these vectors.\n$L_{\\mathrm{sqr}}(\\epsilon) = |\\mathbf{A}_{M,1}| = |\\mathbf{A}_{M,2}| = \\left|-\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right| |\\mathbf{a}_{1}| = \\frac{1+\\epsilon}{|\\epsilon|} a$. We use $|\\epsilon|$ as period is a positive quantity, and $1+\\epsilon > 0$ is guaranteed by the condition $|\\epsilon| \\ll 1$.\n\n**Part (c): Hexagonal Lattice**\n\nThe primitive real-space vectors for the hexagonal lattice are $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right)$.\nNote that the magnitudes are $|\\mathbf{a}_{1}|=a$ and $|\\mathbf{a}_{2}|=a\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2})^{2}+(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^{2}}=a\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{3}{4}}=a$.\nThe derivation proceeds analogously. We first find the reciprocal vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$ for Layer A.\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$:\n$\\mathbf{a}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = 2\\pi$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = 0$. Solving this system yields $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right)$.\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$:\n$\\mathbf{a}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = 0$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}\\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = 2\\pi$. Solving this system yields $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right)$.\n\nThe structure of the problem is identical to the square case. Layer B is dilated by $\\lambda = 1+\\epsilon$, so its reciprocal vectors are $\\mathbf{b}'_{i} = \\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{i}$.\nThe moiré reciprocal vectors are $\\mathbf{G}_{M,i} = \\mathbf{b}'_{i} - \\mathbf{b}_{i} = -\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\mathbf{b}_{i}$.\nThe orientation of the hexagonal moiré superlattice is aligned with the underlying hexagonal lattices, as there is no rotation.\n\nThe real-space moiré lattice vectors $\\mathbf{A}_{M,i}$ are related to the crystal vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{i}$ by the same scaling factor $C = -\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$.\n$\\mathbf{A}_{M,i} = -\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\mathbf{a}_{i}$.\n\nThe moiré period along the primitive directions, $L_{\\mathrm{hex}}(\\epsilon)$, is the magnitude of the primitive moiré lattice vectors.\n$L_{\\mathrm{hex}}(\\epsilon) = |\\mathbf{A}_{M,i}| = \\left|-\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right| |\\mathbf{a}_{i}|$.\nSince $|\\mathbf{a}_{1}| = |\\mathbf{a}_{2}| = a$ for the hexagonal lattice as chosen, the period is:\n$L_{\\mathrm{hex}}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1+\\epsilon}{|\\epsilon|} a$.\n\n**Part (d): Comparison**\n\nComparing the results from parts (b) and (c):\n$L_{\\mathrm{sqr}}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{a(1+\\epsilon)}{|\\epsilon|}$\n$L_{\\mathrm{hex}}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{a(1+\\epsilon)}{|\\epsilon|}$\n\nThe expressions are identical. They do not differ by any geometric factor. This is a general result for any 2D Bravais lattice under pure isotropic strain (dilation) with no rotation: the moiré period, defined as the length of the primitive moiré superlattice vectors, is given by the same expression, provided the length of the primitive vectors of the unstrained lattice is $a$.\n\nThe common moiré period $L(\\epsilon)$ is therefore $\\frac{a(1+\\epsilon)}{|\\epsilon|}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the moiré superlattice period $L(\\theta,\\epsilon)$ for a heterostructure with lattice mismatch $\\epsilon$ and twist angle $\\theta$, followed by a numerical calculation and a discussion of the angle's effect.\n\nThe starting point is the local interlayer displacement field, given by $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{r}$, where the operator $\\mathbf{M}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{M} = (1+\\epsilon)\\mathbf{R}(\\theta) - \\mathbf{I}$.

The Taylor expansions for the trigonometric functions are $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$ and $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\mathbf{M}$:\nThe diagonal elements become:\n$$ (1+\\epsilon)\\cos\\theta - 1 \\approx (1+\\epsilon)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}\\right) - 1 = 1 + \\epsilon - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} - \\frac{\\epsilon\\theta^2}{2} - 1 = \\epsilon - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} - \\frac{\\epsilon\\theta^2}{2} $$\nThe off-diagonal elements become:\n$$ (1+\\epsilon)\\sin\\theta \\approx (1+\\epsilon)\\theta = \\theta + \\epsilon\\theta $$\nNeglecting terms beyond quadratic order (i.e., of order $3$ or higher, such as $\\epsilon\\theta^2$), the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is approximated as:\n$$ \\mathbf{M} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} & -(\\theta + \\epsilon\\theta) \\\\ \\theta + \\epsilon\\theta & \\epsilon - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo simplify further and capture the leading-order behavior, we can retain only terms linear in $\\epsilon$ and $\\theta$:\n$$ \\mathbf{M} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon & -\\theta \\\\ \\theta & \\epsilon \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix represents a combination of a scaling by a factor $\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2+\\theta^2}$ and a rotation.

For any vector $\\mathbf{v}$, the squared magnitude of $\\mathbf{Mv}$ is $|\\mathbf{Mv}|^2 = \\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{M}^T \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{M}^T\\mathbf{M} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon & \\theta \\\\ -\\theta & \\epsilon \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon & -\\theta \\\\ \\theta & \\epsilon \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon^2+\\theta^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\epsilon^2+\\theta^2 \\end{pmatrix} = (\\epsilon^2+\\theta^2)\\mathbf{I} $$\nThus, $|\\mathbf{Mv}|^2 = (\\epsilon^2+\\theta^2)|\\mathbf{v}|^2$, which means $|\\mathbf{Mv}| = \\sqrt{\\epsilon^2+\\theta^2}|\\mathbf{v}|$. This result is exact to quadratic order in $\\epsilon$ and $\\theta$. Using the more precise form of $\\mathbf{M}$ and expanding the result would yield the same expression up to quadratic order.\n\nThe moiré superlattice period $L$ is defined as the magnitude of the smallest nonzero translation vector $\\mathbf{T}$ such that $|\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{T})|$ equals the magnitude of a primitive real-space lattice vector of the reference lattice (graphene), which is $a_{\\mathrm{g}}$.\nThe condition is $|\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{T})| = a_{\\mathrm{g}}$.\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{T}) = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{T}$, we get $|\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{T}| = a_{\\mathrm{g}}$.\nUsing the result from a moment ago, $|\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{T}| = \\sqrt{\\epsilon^2+\\theta^2}|\\mathbf{T}|$.\nLet $L = |\\mathbf{T}|$ be the moiré period. The condition becomes:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\epsilon^2+\\theta^2} L = a_{\\mathrm{g}} $$\nSolving for $L$, we obtain the analytical expression for the moiré superlattice period as a function of the twist angle $\\theta$ and the lattice mismatch $\\epsilon$:\n$$ L(\\theta, \\epsilon) = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{g}}}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}} $$\n\nNext, we compute the zero-twist ($\\theta=0$) moiré period for the graphene/hBN heterostructure, using the given values $a_{\\mathrm{g}} = 0.246~\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\epsilon = 0.018$.\nFor $\\theta=0$, the expression for the period simplifies to:\n$$ L(0, \\epsilon) = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{g}}}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{g}}}{|\\epsilon|} $$\nSince $\\epsilon = 0.018$ is positive, $|\\epsilon|=\\epsilon$.\n$$ L(0, \\epsilon) = \\frac{0.246~\\mathrm{nm}}{0.018} $$\nThe numerical calculation gives:\n$$ L(0, \\epsilon) = \\frac{246}{18}~\\mathrm{nm} = \\frac{41}{3}~\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 13.666...~\\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $13.67~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the leading-order effect of a small but nonzero twist angle $\\theta$ on the moiré period. The general expression is $L(\\theta, \\epsilon) = a_{\\mathrm{g}} / \\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}$.\nFor a fixed lattice mismatch $\\epsilon$, if we introduce a small twist angle $\\theta \\neq 0$, the denominator $\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}$ becomes larger than $\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2} = |\\epsilon|$. Consequently, the moiré period $L(\\theta, \\epsilon)$ decreases. The leading-order effect of a small twist angle is to shorten the moiré period.\n\nThe regime in which twist dominates over lattice mismatch in setting the period is when the contribution from the angle, $\\theta^2$, is significantly larger than the contribution from the mismatch, $\\epsilon^2$. This condition is expressed as $\\theta^2 \\gg \\epsilon^2$, or more simply $|\\theta| \\gg |\\epsilon|$ (since both are small real numbers and $\\theta$ is in radians). In this twist-dominated regime, the expression for the moiré period can be approximated as:\n$$ L(\\theta, \\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{g}}}{\\sqrt{\\theta^2}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{g}}}{|\\theta|} $$\nUnder these conditions, the moiré period is determined almost entirely by the twist angle and is inversely proportional to it, with the lattice mismatch playing a negligible role.",

The reciprocal vectors of the rotated layer, $\\boldsymbol{G}_{2}'$, are:\n$\\boldsymbol{G}_{2,x}' = \\boldsymbol{R}(\\theta)\\boldsymbol{G}_x = G\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + G\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$\n$\\boldsymbol{G}_{2,y}' = \\boldsymbol{R}(\\theta)\\boldsymbol{G}_y = -G\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + G\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$\n\n**Moiré Reciprocal Vectors:**\nThe moiré reciprocal vectors $\\boldsymbol{g}_m$ are the differences $\\boldsymbol{G}_{2}' - \\boldsymbol{G}_{1}'$:\n$\\boldsymbol{g}_{mx} = \\boldsymbol{G}_{2,x}' - \\boldsymbol{G}_{1,x}' = (G\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + G\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) - (1-\\epsilon)G\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} = G\\epsilon\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + G\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$\n$\\boldsymbol{g}_{my} = \\boldsymbol{G}_{2,y}' - \\boldsymbol{G}_{1,y}' = (-G\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + G\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) - (1+\\nu\\epsilon)G\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} = -G\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} - G\\nu\\epsilon\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$\n\n**Moiré Wavelengths:**\nThe wavelengths are given by $L = 2\\pi/|\\boldsymbol{g}_m|$.\n$L_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\boldsymbol{g}_{mx}|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{(G\\epsilon)^2 + (G\\theta)^2}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{G\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}}$\n$L_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\boldsymbol{g}_{my}|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{(-G\\theta)^2 + (-G\\nu\\epsilon)^2}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{G\\sqrt{\\theta^2 + \\nu^2\\epsilon^2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{\\theta^2 + \\nu^2\\epsilon^2}}$\n\n**Normalized Wavelengths and Aspect Ratio:**\nThe normalized wavelengths are:\n$L_x/a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}}$\n$L_y/a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\theta^2 + \\nu^2\\epsilon^2}}$\n\nThe aspect ratio $r = L_y/L_x$ is:\n$r = \\frac{L_y}{L_x} = \\frac{a/\\sqrt{\\theta^2 + \\nu^2\\epsilon^2}}{a/\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon^2 + \\theta^2}{\\theta^2 + \\nu^2\\epsilon^2}}$\n\nThese are the final expressions required by the problem.",
