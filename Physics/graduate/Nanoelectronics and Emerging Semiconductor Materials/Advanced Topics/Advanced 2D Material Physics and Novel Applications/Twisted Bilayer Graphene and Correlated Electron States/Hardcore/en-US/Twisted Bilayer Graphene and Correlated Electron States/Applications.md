## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the fundamental principles governing the electronic structure of [twisted bilayer graphene](@entry_id:145647) (TBG), focusing on the emergence of a moiré superlattice, the formation of nearly flat electronic bands at a magic twist angle, and the theoretical underpinnings of the resulting correlated electron phenomena. Having built this foundation, we now turn our attention to the rich and diverse landscape of applications and interdisciplinary connections that have made TBG a cornerstone of modern [condensed matter](@entry_id:747660) physics. This chapter will not reteach the core principles but will instead explore how they are manifested, probed, and extended in a variety of experimental, theoretical, and computational contexts. We will see how TBG serves as an unprecedentedly tunable platform for realizing and studying exotic phases of [quantum matter](@entry_id:162104), from [unconventional superconductivity](@entry_id:141315) to [topological insulators](@entry_id:137834), and how it connects to broader themes in physics, materials science, and computational modeling.

### Probing the Correlated States: From Transport to Local Spectroscopy

The theoretical prediction of correlated phenomena in TBG is confirmed through a suite of sophisticated experimental techniques. These probes provide the essential link between abstract models and measurable reality, each offering a unique window into the system's electronic properties.

#### Macroscopic Transport and Thermodynamic Signatures

The most direct evidence for correlated states comes from electronic transport measurements. In a typical experiment, the [carrier density](@entry_id:199230) $n$ of a TBG device is controlled by an electrostatic gate voltage. This density is directly related to the moiré [filling factor](@entry_id:146022) $\nu$, defined as the number of charge carriers per moiré unit cell, via the relation $\nu = n A_m$, where $A_m$ is the area of the moiré unit cell. For a typical [magic angle](@entry_id:138416) of $\theta \approx 1.1^\circ$, one full electron per moiré cell corresponds to a density on the order of $10^{11}$ to $10^{12} \, \text{cm}^{-2}$. While a non-interacting, fourfold degenerate (spin and valley) [flat band](@entry_id:137836) would only become insulating when completely empty or completely full (at fillings $\nu=0$ and $\nu=\pm 4$, respectively), experiments reveal pronounced peaks in resistivity at integer fillings such as $\nu = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$. This is a hallmark of strong [electron-electron interactions](@entry_id:139900), which lift the spin-[valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) and open correlation-driven [energy gaps](@entry_id:149280). These many-body phenomena, often referred to as Mott-like insulating states, cannot be explained by single-particle physics and are a primary signature of the correlated electron landscape in TBG .

Beyond simple resistivity, [magnetotransport](@entry_id:1127603) provides deeper insights. The application of a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ quantizes the electron orbits into Landau levels, giving rise to [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) in resistance. The resulting "Landau fan"—a pattern of features in the plane of [carrier density](@entry_id:199230) $n$ versus magnetic field $B$—is a powerful diagnostic tool. According to the Streda formula, the slope of a Landau fan line is directly proportional to the total Chern number of the gapped state, which in turn encodes the degeneracy of the [electronic bands](@entry_id:175335). For instance, near [charge neutrality](@entry_id:138647), the Landau levels in TBG are observed to be twofold degenerate, indicating that the initial fourfold spin-[valley degeneracy](@entry_id:137132) is spontaneously broken. Upon moving to the correlated insulator at filling $\nu = \pm 2$, the degeneracy is further reduced to one, signaling a complete lifting of all symmetries. Furthermore, the phase of these [quantum oscillations](@entry_id:142355) reveals the Berry phase of the quasiparticles. A measured phase of $\pi$ (intercept $\beta \approx 0.5$) near neutrality confirms the persistence of Dirac-like character, while a trivial phase of $0$ (intercept $\beta \approx 0$) emerging from the [correlated insulators](@entry_id:139618) indicates that a gap has opened and the quasiparticles have become massive .

The metallic states separating the [correlated insulators](@entry_id:139618) in TBG are often as fascinating as the insulators themselves. In many correlated systems, such as the cuprate [high-temperature superconductors](@entry_id:156354), resistivity is observed to increase linearly with temperature ($\rho \propto T$), a behavior that defies conventional electron-phonon or [electron-electron scattering](@entry_id:152847) theories and is a signature of a "[strange metal](@entry_id:138796)." TBG also exhibits this linear-in-temperature resistivity over a wide range. This behavior can be analyzed within the framework of Planckian dissipation, a hypothesis that posits a universal upper bound on the scattering rate of quasiparticles, given by $\tau^{-1} \approx k_B T / \hbar$. By fitting experimental resistivity data to a Drude model modified by this scattering mechanism, one can extract the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality, providing a quantitative link between TBG and the broader mystery of strange metallicity in [strongly correlated electron systems](@entry_id:183796) .

Complementing transport measurements, thermodynamic probes can directly access fundamental quantities like the electronic compressibility, $\kappa = (\partial n / \partial \mu)_T$, which measures how the chemical potential $\mu$ changes with carrier density. A powerful technique for measuring $\kappa$ involves sensing the capacitance between the TBG sheet and a nearby gate. This measured capacitance is a series combination of a geometric capacitance, fixed by the device geometry, and a "quantum capacitance," $C_Q = e^2 (\partial n / \partial \mu)$, which is directly proportional to the compressibility. An incompressible state, such as a correlated insulator with an energy gap, has $\partial n / \partial \mu \to 0$, causing $C_Q$ to vanish and the total measured capacitance to plummet. Conversely, strong interactions can sometimes lead to negative electronic compressibility, where electrons effectively attract each other. This counterintuitive phenomenon manifests as an enhancement of the total capacitance beyond the geometric value. Capacitance spectroscopy thus provides a direct [thermodynamic signature](@entry_id:185212) of interaction-driven gaps and instabilities .

#### Local Spectroscopic Probes

While transport and capacitance measurements provide macroscopic information averaged over the entire device, [scanning tunneling microscopy](@entry_id:145374) and spectroscopy (STM/STS) offer a view into the electronic structure at the atomic and moiré length scales. By positioning a sharp metallic tip above the TBG surface and measuring the differential tunneling conductance $dI/dV$, STS provides a direct map of the [local density of states](@entry_id:136852) (LDOS). When TBG enters a superconducting state, STS reveals the characteristic energy gap $\Delta$ as a region of suppressed LDOS around the Fermi energy ($eV=0$), flanked by sharp "coherence peaks" at $eV = \pm\Delta$. Because the flat-band wavefunctions are spatially localized in the $AA$-stacked regions of the [moiré pattern](@entry_id:264251), the superconducting order parameter is expected to be spatially modulated. Indeed, STS measurements show that the gap magnitude $\Delta(\mathbf{r})$ is largest in the $AA$ regions and smaller in the $AB/BA$ regions, providing real-space visualization of the inhomogeneous nature of moiré superconductivity.

Furthermore, the detailed shape of the STS spectrum carries crucial information. In many cases, the coherence peaks are asymmetric, with the peak at negative bias (probing occupied states) being different in height from the peak at positive bias (probing empty states). This asymmetry is a direct reflection of particle-hole asymmetry in the normal-state band structure, which is a known feature of realistic TBG models. It is important to note, however, that extrinsic factors such as an energy-dependent tunneling [matrix element](@entry_id:136260) can also contribute to such asymmetry, a caveat that must be considered in a rigorous analysis .

### Harnessing and Tuning Topology

One of the most profound aspects of TBG is its capacity to host topologically non-trivial electronic states. These states are characterized by global properties of the band structure, such as the Berry curvature and Chern number, which are robust to local perturbations and give rise to quantized [transport phenomena](@entry_id:147655).

#### Symmetry, External Fields, and Topological Bands

The topology of the moiré bands is intimately linked to the system's symmetries. In an idealized Bistritzer-MacDonald model, a combination of twofold rotation and [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094), denoted $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$, protects the existence of Dirac points at the moiré Brillouin zone corners, ensuring the system is a gapless semimetal. A key experimental tuning knob is the perpendicular displacement field, $D$, which is controlled by a dual-gate device geometry. This field applies an electrostatic [potential difference](@entry_id:275724) between the two graphene layers, explicitly breaking the inversion-like $C_{2z}$ symmetry. The breaking of $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$ lifts the protection of the Dirac points, allowing a band gap to open at [charge neutrality](@entry_id:138647). Crucially, in this gapped state, the bands are no longer required to have zero Berry curvature. While [time-reversal symmetry](@entry_id:138094) $\mathcal{T}$ remains intact and ensures the total Chern number summed over both valleys is zero, the individual bands can acquire non-zero valley-resolved Chern numbers, $C_K = -C_{K'}$. This state is known as a quantum valley Hall insulator and is a direct consequence of electrically controllable symmetry breaking .

#### The Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect

The existence of these electrically tunable topological bands paves the way for one of the most striking discoveries in TBG: the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). The QAHE is a phenomenon where a material exhibits a perfectly quantized Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{xy} = C e^2/h$ with integer $C$, in the complete absence of an external magnetic field. This requires the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry, typically through [magnetic ordering](@entry_id:143206), in a topologically non-trivial band. In TBG, this can be achieved by aligning the graphene with its hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. This alignment breaks sublattice symmetry (related to $C_{2z}$), which, combined with strong [electron-electron interactions](@entry_id:139900), helps to open a robust gap and stabilize a valley-polarized ferromagnetic state. In this state, only one valley is occupied, so the net Chern number of the system becomes that of the occupied valley, $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_K \neq 0$. Experiments have demonstrated hysteretic and quantized Hall plateaus at integer fillings (e.g., $\nu=-2$) with $\sigma_{xy} = \pm 2 e^2/h$, corresponding to a Chern number of $C=\pm 2$. Remarkably, the sign of the quantization can be flipped by reversing the direction of the perpendicular [displacement field](@entry_id:141476) $D$, demonstrating unprecedented electrical control over a [macroscopic quantum state](@entry_id:192759) .

The connection between the zero-field topological state and the conventional quantum Hall effect at finite magnetic field is elegantly described by the Streda formula. This relation predicts that the lines of constant integer Hall conductivity in the $(n, B)$ plane (the Landau fan) should have a slope proportional to the total Chern number of the many-body state. For a system that is already a Chern insulator with $\mathcal{C}=C$ at $B=0$, the subsequent Landau levels add to this integer, leading to quantum Hall states with total Chern number $C+m$, where $m$ is the Landau level index. This predicts a characteristic shift in the entire Landau fan, which has been experimentally confirmed and provides a powerful link between zero-field topology and finite-field [magnetotransport](@entry_id:1127603) .

As the magnetic field increases, the interplay between the single-particle Zeeman energy ($E_Z \propto B$), the interaction-driven Coulomb energy ($E_C \propto \sqrt{B}$), and other intrinsic anisotropies leads to a rich phase diagram of so-called quantum Hall ferromagnets. The system spontaneously polarizes its flavor (spin, valley, or orbital) to maximize the energy gap. By modeling the field dependence of these competing [energy scales](@entry_id:196201), one can predict a sequence of phase transitions between different flavor-polarized states as the magnetic field is swept .

### The Enigma of Moiré Superconductivity

Perhaps the most celebrated discovery in TBG is the emergence of superconductivity. This superconductivity is unconventional, appearing in close proximity to correlated insulating states and exhibiting properties that differ from traditional BCS superconductors. A central question is the nature of the Cooper pairing—specifically, its symmetry. This can be investigated using Josephson junctions, where the TBG superconductor is connected by two conventional superconducting leads. The [current-phase relation](@entry_id:202338) (CPR) and its response to a magnetic field (the Fraunhofer pattern) serve as powerful probes of [pairing symmetry](@entry_id:139531). In many experiments, the Fraunhofer pattern is highly anomalous: it is asymmetric with respect to reversing the magnetic field ($I_c(B) \neq I_c(-B)$), and its interference nodes are lifted. Such [non-reciprocity](@entry_id:168607) is a smoking-gun signature of broken time-reversal symmetry *within the superconducting state itself*. This, combined with a highly skewed CPR, points towards exotic pairing symmetries, such as a chiral $d+id$ state, that are forbidden in most conventional materials .

### The Broader Moiré Landscape and Interdisciplinary Frontiers

The study of TBG has catalyzed a much broader investigation into [moiré materials](@entry_id:143547), while also highlighting the importance of real-world material properties and fostering connections to other fields of physics.

#### Real-World Effects: Asymmetry and Disorder

While idealized models are useful, understanding real devices requires accounting for deviations from perfection. One common experimental observation is a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry: the phase diagram on the electron-doped side often looks different from the hole-doped side. This has two primary origins. First, the non-interacting band structure itself has a slight intrinsic particle-hole asymmetry due to effects like lattice relaxation. Second, the long-range Hartree component of the Coulomb interaction renormalizes the bands in an asymmetric way. Because the flat conduction band wavefunctions are more localized in the $AA$-stacking regions than their valence band counterparts, they experience a stronger repulsive interaction upon electron doping. This combination of intrinsic and interaction-induced effects leads to a significant and observable asymmetry in the electronic properties .

Another crucial real-world factor is structural disorder, particularly small variations in the twist angle across a device, $\theta(\mathbf{r}) = \bar{\theta} + \delta\theta(\mathbf{r})$. Since the electronic bandwidth $W$ is exquisitely sensitive to the twist angle near the [magic angle](@entry_id:138416), even minute spatial fluctuations in $\theta$ can lead to significant spatial variations in the local bandwidth and, consequently, the local correlation-driven energy gap. This creates a complex landscape of superconducting and insulating domains. The macroscopic transport properties of such an inhomogeneous sample, such as the superconducting resistive transition, can be effectively modeled using concepts from statistical physics, framing the problem as a percolation transition on a random resistor network  .

#### Beyond Twisted Bilayer Graphene

The fundamental principles of moiré engineering are not limited to TBG. By changing the constituent layers, one can design a vast family of moiré [heterostructures](@entry_id:136451) with distinct properties.
- **Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene (TDBG)**, which consists of two rotated Bernal-stacked bilayers, offers a compelling alternative to TBG. TDBG lacks the $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry that protects the Dirac points in TBG, and its bandwidth and topology are highly tunable with a perpendicular [displacement field](@entry_id:141476). This enhanced tunability makes TDBG an excellent platform for realizing robust and switchable Chern insulating states, complementing the [phase diagram](@entry_id:142460) of TBG which prominently features superconductivity .
- **TMD Heterobilayers**, formed by stacking two different [transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers](@entry_id:193833) (e.g., WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), introduce another crucial ingredient: strong [spin-orbit coupling](@entry_id:143520) (SOC). The intrinsic Ising-type SOC in TMDs pins the electron spins to the out-of-plane direction, with the preferred orientation depending on the valley. This has profound consequences. For instance, it can give rise to "Ising superconductivity," a novel phase that is remarkably robust against in-plane magnetic fields that would destroy conventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the strong SOC lifts the spin degeneracy of Landau levels from the outset, creating a distinct magneto-transport spectrum compared to the fourfold degenerate levels in TBG. Comparing and contrasting these different moiré platforms reveals universal principles while also highlighting the unique opportunities afforded by engineering the symmetries and interactions of the constituent layers .

In conclusion, [twisted bilayer graphene](@entry_id:145647) and its relatives have transcended their initial role as a condensed matter curiosity. They have become rich, tunable quantum simulators where fundamental concepts of topology, strong correlation, and symmetry can be explored and controlled with unprecedented precision. The applications and interdisciplinary connections discussed in this chapter, from precision electronic measurements to concepts in statistical and [high-energy physics](@entry_id:181260), underscore the field's vitality and its promise for uncovering new frontiers of quantum science.
