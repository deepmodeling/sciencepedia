The materials specified, $\\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\\mathrm{Ga}_{0.47}\\mathrm{As}$ and $\\mathrm{AlAs}$, are commonly used in RTD fabrication, and the provided physical parameters (bandgaps, electron affinities, temperature) are within realistic ranges for these materials.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary data and explicit assumptions required to derive a unique solution. The required output is precisely defined. The problem is neither underspecified nor overconstrained.\n- **Objective:** The problem is articulated using precise, technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the zero-bias electron barrier height, $\\Phi_B$, which is defined as the energy difference between the conduction band minimum of the barrier material, $E_{C,\\mathrm{barrier}}$, and the emitter quasi-Fermi level, $E_F$. We begin by establishing the energy band alignment at the heterojunction.\n\nThe electron affinity, $\\chi$, is defined as the energy required to move an electron from the conduction band minimum, $E_C$, to the vacuum level, $E_{vac}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\chi = E_{vac} - E_C $$\nTherefore, the conduction band minimum can be expressed relative to the vacuum level as:\n$$ E_C = E_{vac} - \\chi $$\nThe problem specifies the use of Anderson's rule, which posits that the vacuum energy level, $E_{vac}$, is continuous across the interface of the heterojunction. This means that at the interface between the $\\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\\mathrm{Ga}_{0.47}\\mathrm{As}$ emitter and the $\\mathrm{AlAs}$ barrier, we have:\n$$ E_{vac,\\mathrm{well}} = E_{vac,\\mathrm{barrier}} $$\nThe conduction band offset, $\\Delta E_C$, is the difference in the conduction band energy minima between the two materials. It is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta E_C = E_{C,\\mathrm{barrier}} - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_C$ in terms of electron affinity, we get:\n$$ \\Delta E_C = (E_{vac,\\mathrm{barrier}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{barrier}}) - (E_{vac,\\mathrm{well}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{well}}) $$\nGiven the continuity of the vacuum level, $E_{vac,\\mathrm{barrier}} = E_{vac,\\mathrm{well}}$, the expression for the conduction band offset simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta E_C = \\chi_{\\mathrm{well}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{barrier}} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the conduction band offset. Using the provided values:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{well}} = 4.90\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{barrier}} = 3.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe numerical value of the conduction band offset is:\n$$ \\Delta E_C = 4.90\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 3.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.40\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe barrier height, $\\Phi_B$, is defined as the energy difference between the conduction band edge of the barrier and the quasi-Fermi level in the emitter:\n$$ \\Phi_B = E_{C,\\mathrm{barrier}} - E_F $$\nTo derive a computable expression for $\\Phi_B$, we can rewrite this equation by introducing the conduction band edge of the emitter material, $E_{C,\\mathrm{well}}$:\n$$ \\Phi_B = (E_{C,\\mathrm{barrier}} - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}}) + (E_{C,\\mathrm{well}} - E_F) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\Phi_B = (E_{C,\\mathrm{barrier}} - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}}) - (E_F - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}}) $$\nThe first term, $(E_{C,\\mathrm{barrier}} - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}})$, is the conduction band offset $\\Delta E_C$. The second term, $(E_F - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}})$, is the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level and the conduction band edge in the heavily doped emitter, which is given in the problem statement. Thus, the derived expression for the barrier height is:\n$$ \\Phi_B = \\Delta E_C - (E_F - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta E_C$:\n$$ \\Phi_B = (\\chi_{\\mathrm{well}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{barrier}}) - (E_F - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}}) $$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $\\Phi_B$. We have already calculated $\\Delta E_C = 1.40\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, and the problem provides:\n$$ E_F - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}} = 0.12\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Phi_B$:\n$$ \\Phi_B = 1.40\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.12\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.28\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe problem requires the final numerical result to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the value is $1.280\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nFinal derived expressions:\nConduction band offset: $\\Delta E_C = \\chi_{\\mathrm{well}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{barrier}}$\nBarrier height: $\\Phi_B = (\\chi_{\\mathrm{well}} - \\chi_{\\mathrm{barrier}}) - (E_F - E_{C,\\mathrm{well}})$\nFinal numerical result: $\\Phi_B = 1.280\\ \\mathrm{eV}$",

            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics, specifically the theory of quantum transport in mesoscopic systems. It is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing a sufficient basis for a rigorous derivation.\n\nWe begin by modeling the quasi-bound state in the quantum well as a single discrete energy level at energy $E_0$. The coupling of this state to the continuous spectra of states in the left ($L$) and right ($R$) contacts (reservoirs) broadens the level and gives it a finite lifetime. This physical situation can be formally described using the Green's function formalism.\n\nThe retarded Green's function for the isolated, uncoupled discrete level is given by:\n$$\nG_0^R(E) = \\frac{1}{E - E_0 + i\\eta}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal positive quantity. When the level is coupled to the contacts, its properties are modified. This modification is captured by a complex self-energy, $\\Sigma^R(E)$. The full, or \"dressed,\" Green's function is then given by the Dyson equation:\n$$\nG^R(E) = \\left[ (G_0^R(E))^{-1} - \\Sigma^R(E) \\right]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{E - E_0 - \\Sigma^R(E)}\n$$\nThe self-energy $\\Sigma^R(E)$ is the sum of contributions from the coupling to each contact: $\\Sigma^R(E) = \\Sigma_L^R(E) + \\Sigma_R^R(E)$. The imaginary part of the self-energy is related to the escape or partial decay rates, $\\Gamma_L$ and $\\Gamma_R$, which represent the rates at which an electron in the well tunnels out into the left and right contacts, respectively. The relationship is:\n$$\n\\text{Im}(\\Sigma_{i}^R(E)) = -\\frac{\\Gamma_{i}(E)}{2}\n$$\nfor $i \\in \\{L, R\\}$. The real part of the self-energy, $\\text{Re}(\\Sigma^R(E))$, produces an energy shift of the resonance level $E_0$. For simplicity and as is common in the wide-band approximation (where the density of states in the contacts and the tunnel coupling are assumed to be constant over the energy range of the resonance), we can neglect the energy dependence of $\\Gamma_{L,R}$ and the real part of $\\Sigma^R(E)$ (or, equivalently, assume that $E_0$ is the already-renormalized energy). Thus, the total self-energy becomes a constant imaginary value:\n$$\n\\Sigma^R(E) \\approx \\Sigma_L^R + \\Sigma_R^R = -i \\frac{\\Gamma_L}{2} - i \\frac{\\Gamma_R}{2} = -i \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Dyson equation gives the dressed Green's function for the quasi-bound state:\n$$\nG^R(E) = \\frac{1}{E - E_0 + i \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}}\n$$\nThe transmission probability $T(E)$ through this single-level system is given by the Landauer–Büttiker formula, which in the Green's function formalism for a two-terminal device is expressed as:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_L(E) |G^R(E)|^2 \\Gamma_R(E)\n$$\nUsing our constant- $\\Gamma$ approximation, this becomes:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R \\left| \\frac{1}{E - E_0 + i \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}} \\right|^2\n$$\nCalculating the squared modulus of the complex denominator, we obtain the energy-dependent transmission probability, which is the Breit-Wigner formula:\n$$\nT(E) = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E - E_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThis expression describes a Lorentzian resonance centered at $E_0$.\n\nWith this result, we can determine the requested quantities.\n\n1.  **Maximum Resonant Transmission, $T_{\\text{max}}$**\n    The transmission is maximized at the resonance energy, $E = E_0$. Substituting this into the expression for $T(E)$:\n    $$\n    T_{\\text{max}} = T(E=E_0) = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E_0 - E_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    T_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}\n    $$\n    For the symmetric case where the barriers are identical ($t_L = t_R$), the escape rates are equal, $\\Gamma_L = \\Gamma_R = \\Gamma_0$. The maximum transmission becomes $T_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{4 \\Gamma_0^2}{(\\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_0)^2} = \\frac{4 \\Gamma_0^2}{(2\\Gamma_0)^2} = 1$, corresponding to perfect transmission. For any asymmetry, $\\Gamma_L \\neq \\Gamma_R$, the denominator $(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2$ is strictly greater than $4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R$ (this follows from $(\\Gamma_L - \\Gamma_R)^2 > 0$). Consequently, $T_{\\text{max}}  1$. Asymmetry breaks the impedance matching between the incoming and outgoing channels, increasing reflection and reducing peak transmission below unity.\n\n2.  **Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM), $\\Delta E$**\n    The FWHM is the energy width $\\Delta E = |E_+ - E_-|$, where $E_+$ and $E_-$ are the energies at which the transmission is half of its maximum value, i.e., $T(E_\\pm) = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\text{max}}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E_\\pm - E_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2} \\right] = \\frac{2 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}\n    $$\n    Canceling the $\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R$ terms and inverting both sides:\n    $$\n    (E_\\pm - E_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}{2}\n    $$\n    Solving for $(E_\\pm - E_0)^2$:\n    $$\n    (E_\\pm - E_0)^2 = \\frac{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}{2} - \\frac{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}{4} = \\frac{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}{4}\n    $$\n    Taking the square root gives the detuning from the resonance center:\n    $$\n    E_\\pm - E_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\n    $$\n    The two energies are $E_+ = E_0 + \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}$ and $E_- = E_0 - \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}$. The FWHM is their difference:\n    $$\n    \\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = \\left(E_0 + \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right) - \\left(E_0 - \\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}\\right) = \\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R\n    $$\n    The total energy broadening of the resonance is the sum of the partial decay widths into the left and right contacts.\n\n3.  **Lifetime of the Quasi-bound State, $\\tau$**\n    The lifetime $\\tau$ of the quasi-bound state is related to the total probability per unit time of an electron escaping the well. This total escape rate is the sum of the escape rates to the left and right, $\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R$. In quantum mechanics, energy and time are conjugate variables linked by the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$. The lifetime of a state with an energy width (uncertainty) of $\\Delta E$ is given by the time-energy uncertainty principle, $\\tau \\approx \\hbar/\\Delta E$. More formally, the pole of the Green's function is at the complex energy $E = E_0 - i\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2}$. The time evolution of the state's wavefunction amplitude $\\psi(t)$ includes a factor $\\exp(-iEt/\\hbar)$. The probability density $|\\psi(t)|^2$ therefore decays as $\\exp \\left[ -2 \\cdot \\text{Im}(E) \\cdot t / \\hbar \\right] = \\exp \\left[ -(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R) t / \\hbar \\right]$. This is an exponential decay of the form $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$, which defines the lifetime $\\tau$ as:\n    $$\n    \\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}\n    $$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Combining this with the FWHM result, we confirm the relation $\\Delta E \\cdot \\tau = \\hbar$.\n\nThe final results are collected as follows.\n$T_{\\text{max}}$: The maximum transmission probability at resonance.\n$\\tau$: The lifetime of the quasi-bound state.\n$\\Delta E$: The full-width at half-maximum of the transmission resonance.",

The measured terminal voltage is therefore the sum of the intrinsic RTD voltage and the voltage drop across the parasitics.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor device physics and circuit theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and phrased objectively. No flaws that would invalidate the problem have been identified.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relationship between measured and intrinsic differential resistance, an analysis of how parasitic series resistance affects the observed negative differential resistance (NDR), a proposal for a de-embedding procedure, and a final calculation of the intrinsic NDR magnitude from given experimental data.\n\nWe begin by modeling the system as an intrinsic resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in series with a total parasitic resistance, $R_s$. This parasitic resistance is the sum of the contact resistance, $R_c$, and the access resistance, $R_a$.\n$$R_s = R_c + R_a$$\nThe entire series combination is treated as a two-terminal device. Let $I$ be the current flowing through the device. Let $V_{\\mathrm{int}}$ be the voltage drop across the intrinsic RTD, and $V_m$ be the total measured voltage across the terminals. According to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, the measured voltage is the sum of the intrinsic voltage and the voltage drop across the parasitic series resistance, $V_p$.\n$$V_m = V_{\\mathrm{int}} + V_p$$\nThe parasitic resistance is assumed to be linear and bias-independent, so the voltage drop across it is given by Ohm's Law:\n$$V_p = I \\cdot R_s$$\nSubstituting this into the KVL equation, we express the measured voltage as a function of the current $I$:\n$$V_m(I) = V_{\\mathrm{int}}(I) + I \\cdot R_s$$\nThe small-signal differential resistance is defined as the derivative of voltage with respect to current. The measured differential resistance, $r_m$, and the intrinsic differential resistance, $r_{\\mathrm{int}}$, are therefore:\n$$r_m = \\frac{dV_m}{dI}$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{int}}}{dI}$$\nTo find the relationship between $r_m$ and $r_{\\mathrm{int}}$, we differentiate the expression for $V_m(I)$ with respect to the current $I$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dI} V_m(I) = \\frac{d}{dI} (V_{\\mathrm{int}}(I) + I \\cdot R_s)$$\nUsing the sum rule for differentiation:\n$$\\frac{dV_m}{dI} = \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{int}}}{dI} + \\frac{d}{dI}(I \\cdot R_s)$$\nSince $R_s$ is given as a constant, its derivative with respect to $I$ is zero, and $\\frac{d}{dI}(I \\cdot R_s) = R_s$. Substituting the definitions for $r_m$ and $r_{\\mathrm{int}}$, we arrive at the fundamental relationship:\n$$r_m = r_{\\mathrm{int}} + R_s$$\nThis equation is the answer to the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate how the parasitic series resistance, $R_s$, alters the apparent NDR magnitude. The intrinsic device exhibits NDR when $r_{\\mathrm{int}}  0$. Let the intrinsic NDR be $r_{\\mathrm{int}} = -|r_{\\mathrm{int}}|$. The measured differential resistance is then $r_m = -|r_{\\mathrm{int}}| + R_s$. Since $R_s$ is a physical resistance, it is strictly positive ($R_s  0$). This means that $r_m$ is always algebraically greater (less negative) than $r_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\nThe measured NDR magnitude is $|r_m| = |-|r_{\\mathrm{int}}| + R_s|$.\nThere are two scenarios:\n1.  If the intrinsic NDR magnitude is greater than the parasitic resistance ($|r_{\\mathrm{int}}|  R_s$), then $r_m  0$. The measured NDR magnitude is $|r_m| = |r_{\\mathrm{int}}| - R_s$. In this case, the measured NDR magnitude is attenuated by the value of the series resistance.\n2.  If the intrinsic NDR magnitude is less than or equal to the parasitic resistance ($|r_{\\mathrm{int}}| \\le R_s$), then $r_m \\ge 0$. The measured differential resistance is non-negative, and the NDR phenomenon is completely masked in the external measurement.\nIn summary, parasitic series resistance invariably reduces the apparent magnitude of NDR and can even suppress its observation entirely.\n\nTo de-embed the parasitics from measured current-voltage ($I$-$V$) data, one must first determine $R_s$. A physically justified method is to measure the differential resistance $r_m$ at a high bias point, far into the monotonically increasing region of the $I$-$V$ characteristic beyond the valley point. In this region, the intrinsic differential resistance $r_{\\mathrm{int}}$ of the RTD is typically small and positive, and can often be neglected in comparison to $R_s$. Thus, one can approximate $R_s \\approx r_m$ in this high-bias regime. Once an accurate value for $R_s$ is obtained (either by this method or independent characterization as stated in the problem), one can \"correct\" the measured voltage data. For each measured data point $(I_i, V_{m,i})$, the corresponding intrinsic voltage point $V_{\\mathrm{int},i}$ is calculated using the rearranged KVL equation:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{int},i} = V_{m,i} - I_i \\cdot R_s$$\nPlotting $V_{\\mathrm{int},i}$ versus $I_i$ yields the de-embedded, intrinsic $I$-$V$ characteristic of the RTD.\n\nFinally, we compute the intrinsic NDR magnitude $|r_{\\mathrm{int}}(I^{\\star})|$ using the provided data.\nThe total parasitic series resistance $R_s$ is:\n$$R_s = R_c + R_a = 7\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} + 15\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} = 22\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$$\nThe relationship derived earlier is $r_m = r_{\\mathrm{int}} + R_s$. We can solve for the intrinsic differential resistance, $r_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{int}} = r_m - R_s$$\nAt the bias point $I^{\\star} = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, the measured small-signal differential resistance is $r_m(I^{\\star}) = -18\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{int}}(I^{\\star}) = -18\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} - 22\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega} = -40\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$$\nThe problem asks for the intrinsic NDR magnitude, which is the absolute value of this result:\n$$|r_{\\mathrm{int}}(I^{\\star})| = |-40\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}| = 40\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$$\nThe answer must be rounded to three significant figures. To express $40$ with three significant figures, we write it as $40.0$.\nThus, the intrinsic NDR magnitude is $40.0\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$.",
