A solution will be provided.\n\nThe gate capacitance per unit length, $C'$, is defined as the magnitude of the charge per unit length on one of the conductors, $Q'$, divided by the potential difference, $V$, between the two conductors:\n$$\nC' = \\frac{Q'}{V}\n$$\nThe system is a coaxial capacitor. The inner conductor is the semiconductor nanowire surface at radius $r = r_w$. The outer conductor is the metal gate at radius $r = r_w + t_{ox}$. The region between them, $r_w < r < r_w + t_{ox}$, is filled with a dielectric of permittivity $\\epsilon_{ox}$.\n\nTo find the potential difference $V$, we first determine the electric field $\\vec{E}$ in the dielectric region using Gauss's law. We assume a charge per unit length $+Q'$ on the inner conductor and $-Q'$ on the outer conductor. By cylindrical symmetry, the electric field must be purely radial, $\\vec{E} = E(r)\\hat{r}$.\n\nConsider a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $r$ ($r_w < r < r_w + t_{ox}$) and arbitrary length $L$. The charge enclosed by this surface is $Q_{enc} = Q'L$. Gauss's law in a dielectric medium states $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_{ox}}$.\n\nThe electric flux through the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder is zero because $\\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to the surface normal. The flux is non-zero only through the side wall, which has an area of $2\\pi r L$.\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = E(r) \\cdot (2\\pi r L)\n$$\nEquating this with the expression from Gauss's law:\n$$\nE(r) (2\\pi r L) = \\frac{Q'L}{\\epsilon_{ox}}\n$$\nSolving for the magnitude of the electric field $E(r)$:\n$$\nE(r) = \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox} r}\n$$\nThe potential difference $V$ between the inner and outer conductors is the line integral of the electric field from the inner conductor to the outer conductor:\n$$\nV = V_{inner} - V_{outer} = -\\int_{r_w + t_{ox}}^{r_w} E(r) dr = \\int_{r_w}^{r_w + t_{ox}} E(r) dr\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E(r)$:\n$$\nV = \\int_{r_w}^{r_w + t_{ox}} \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox} r} dr = \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}} \\int_{r_w}^{r_w + t_{ox}} \\frac{1}{r} dr\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\nV = \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}} \\left[ \\ln(r) \\right]_{r_w}^{r_w + t_{ox}} = \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}} \\left( \\ln(r_w + t_{ox}) - \\ln(r_w) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_w + t_{ox}}{r_w}\\right) = \\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t_{ox}}{r_w}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we can find the capacitance per unit length $C'$:\n$$\nC' = \\frac{Q'}{V} = \\frac{Q'}{\\frac{Q'}{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}} \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t_{ox}}{r_w}\\right)}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the analytical expression for the gate capacitance per unit length:\n$$\nC' = \\frac{2\\pi \\epsilon_{ox}}{\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{t_{ox}}{r_w}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given values:\n$r_{w} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t_{ox} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\epsilon_{ox} = 20\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n$\\epsilon_{0} = 8.854\\,187\\,817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $C'$:\n$$\nC' = \\frac{2\\pi (20 \\epsilon_{0})}{\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right)} = \\frac{40\\pi \\epsilon_{0}}{\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)} = \\frac{40\\pi \\epsilon_{0}}{\\ln(1.4)}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nC' = \\frac{40\\pi (8.854\\,187\\,817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m})}{\\ln(1.4)}\n$$\n$$\nC' \\approx \\frac{1.112650056 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}}{0.3364722366}\n$$\n$$\nC' \\approx 3.3068218 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in units of nanofarads per meter ($\\mathrm{nF/m}$).

The given numerical values are plausible for a research-grade nanowire transistor. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe total resistance of the Nanowire Field-Effect Transistor (NWFET) as seen from the external terminals is the series combination of the source contact resistance ($R_S$), the channel resistance ($R_{ch}$), and the drain contact resistance ($R_D$).\nBased on the problem statement, $R_S = R_D = R_c$. The total resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_S + R_{ch} + R_D = 2R_c + R_{ch}$$\nThe gate voltage, $V_g$, modulates the channel conductance $G_{ch}$, and thus the channel resistance $R_{ch} = 1/G_{ch}$. Consequently, $R_{ch}$ is a function of $V_g$, which we denote as $R_{ch}(V_g)$. The contact resistances, $R_c$, are assumed to be independent of $V_g$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's laws, for a small applied external drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$, the resulting drain current $I_d$ is given by Ohm's law for the entire device:\n$$I_d = \\frac{V_{ds}}{R_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{V_{ds}}{2R_c + R_{ch}(V_g)}$$\nThe measured transconductance, $g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}}$, is defined as the partial derivative of the drain current $I_d$ with respect to the gate voltage $V_g$, holding the external drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$ constant:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_g} \\bigg|_{V_{ds}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_d$, we can compute this derivative:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_g} \\left( \\frac{V_{ds}}{2R_c + R_{ch}(V_g)} \\right) = V_{ds} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{(2R_c + R_{ch}(V_g))^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial R_{ch}(V_g)}{\\partial V_g}$$\nThis expression relates the measured transconductance to the rate of change of the channel resistance with respect to gate voltage.\n\nNext, we define the intrinsic transconductance, $g_{m,\\mathrm{int}}$. The problem states this is the transconductance that would be measured if the contacts were ideal, i.e., $R_c = 0$. For an ideal device, the total resistance is simply the channel resistance, $R_{ch}(V_g)$. The drain current, which we can call $I_{d,\\mathrm{int}}$, would be:\n$$I_{d,\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{V_{ds}}{R_{ch}(V_g)}$$\nThe intrinsic transconductance is then the derivative of this ideal current with respect to $V_g$ at the same constant external $V_{ds}$:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{d,\\mathrm{int}}}{\\partial V_g} \\bigg|_{V_{ds}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_g} \\left( \\frac{V_{ds}}{R_{ch}(V_g)} \\right) = V_{ds} \\cdot \\frac{-1}{(R_{ch}(V_g))^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial R_{ch}(V_g)}{\\partial V_g}$$\nWe now have two expressions, one for $g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}}$ and one for $g_{m,\\mathrm{int}}$. Both contain the term $V_{ds} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial R_{ch}(V_g)}{\\partial V_g}$. We can rearrange the expression for $g_{m,\\mathrm{int}}$ to solve for this term:\n$$V_{ds} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial R_{ch}(V_g)}{\\partial V_g} = -g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} \\cdot (R_{ch}(V_g))^2$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}}$:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{-1}{(2R_c + R_{ch}(V_g))^2} \\cdot \\left( -g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} \\cdot (R_{ch}(V_g))^2 \\right)$$\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} = g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} \\cdot \\frac{(R_{ch}(V_g))^2}{(2R_c + R_{ch}(V_g))^2}$$\nThe quantities $R_c$, $R_{ch}$, and $g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}}$ in the problem statement are all evaluated at the same specific operating point, so we can drop the explicit functional dependence notation. To find the intrinsic transconductance $g_{m,\\mathrm{int}}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} = g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} \\cdot \\frac{(2R_c + R_{ch})^2}{R_{ch}^2} = g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} \\left( \\frac{2R_c + R_{ch}}{R_{ch}} \\right)^2$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} = g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2R_c}{R_{ch}} \\right)^2$$\nThis is the desired expression for the de-embedded intrinsic transconductance.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n- $R_{c} = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\Omega$\n- $R_{ch} = 4.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\Omega$\n- $g_{m,\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.200\\,\\mathrm{mS} = 0.200 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless correction factor:\n$$\\left( 1 + \\frac{2R_c}{R_{ch}} \\right)^2 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{2 \\cdot (1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega)}{4.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega} \\right)^2 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^3}{4.00 \\times 10^3} \\right)^2$$\n$$= (1 + 0.500)^2 = (1.500)^2 = 2.250$$\nThe calculation maintains the precision of the input values.\n\nFinally, we compute $g_{m,\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$g_{m,\\mathrm{int}} = (0.200\\,\\mathrm{mS}) \\cdot (2.250) = 0.450\\,\\mathrm{mS}$$\nThe input values are given to three significant figures, so the final answer should also be expressed with three significant figures.",

We consider a small-signal AC analysis. Let a sinusoidal gate voltage with a small amplitude be applied to the gate terminal, represented in phasor form as $V_g$. This time-varying voltage induces a time-varying charge on the gate, $Q_g$.\n\nThe gate current, $I_g$, is the time rate of change of the gate charge. For a sinusoidal signal with angular frequency $\\omega$, this relationship is given by:\n$$I_g = \\frac{dQ_g}{dt}$$\nIn the phasor domain, for a signal with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, this becomes:\n$$I_g = j\\omega Q_g$$\nThe total gate capacitance, $C_{gg}$, relates the small-signal gate charge $Q_g$ to the small-signal gate voltage $V_g$:\n$$Q_g = C_{gg} V_g$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the gate current gives:\n$$I_g = j\\omega C_{gg} V_g$$\nThe transconductance, $g_m$, relates the resulting small-signal drain current, $I_d$, to the small-signal gate voltage $V_g$ under the condition of a short-circuited output (drain-source AC voltage is zero):\n$$I_d = g_m V_g$$\nThe short-circuit current gain, $A_i$, is the ratio of the drain current phasor to the gate current phasor:\n$$A_i = \\frac{I_d}{I_g}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_d$ and $I_g$:\n$$A_i = \\frac{g_m V_g}{j\\omega C_{gg} V_g} = \\frac{g_m}{j\\omega C_{gg}}$$\nBy definition, $f_T$ is the frequency where the magnitude of this gain is unity.

To understand how geometric scaling affects $f_T$, we must analyze how $g_m$ and $C_{gg}$ change as the nanowire radius $r_w$ and oxide thickness $t_{ox}$ are reduced.\n\nThe total gate capacitance $C_{gg}$ of a nanowire FET is not solely determined by electrostatics. It is a series combination of the electrostatic (oxide) capacitance, $C_{ox}$, and the quantum capacitance of the one-dimensional channel, $C_q$:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{gg}} = \\frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{1}{C_q} \\quad \\implies \\quad C_{gg} = \\frac{C_{ox} C_q}{C_{ox} + C_q}$$\nThe quantum capacitance $C_q$ arises from the finite density of states (DOS) in the semiconductor channel and represents a fundamental limit on the amount of charge that can be induced for a given change in channel potential. It is given by $C_q = e^2 g(E_F)$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $g(E_F)$ is the DOS per unit energy at the Fermi level.\n\nThe electrostatic capacitance for a gate-all-around nanowire of length $L$ can be modeled as a cylindrical capacitor:\n$$C_{ox} = \\frac{2\\pi\\epsilon_{ox}L}{\\ln(1 + t_{ox}/r_w)}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{ox}$ is the oxide permittivity.\n\n**Effect of reducing oxide thickness $t_{ox}$:**\nReducing $t_{ox}$ causes the logarithmic term $\\ln(1 + t_{ox}/r_w)$ to decrease, which leads to a significant increase in $C_{ox}$. As $C_{ox}$ increases, $C_{gg}$ also increases, approaching $C_q$ as an upper limit:\n$$\\lim_{C_{ox} \\to \\infty} C_{gg} = \\lim_{C_{ox} \\to \\infty} \\frac{C_q}{1 + C_q/C_{ox}} = C_q$$\nThis is the **quantum capacitance limit (QCL)**. The transconductance $g_m$ is a measure of the gate's control over the channel current. Better gate control, achieved by increasing $C_{ox}$ (i.e., reducing $t_{ox}$), increases $g_m$. However, like $C_{gg}$, $g_m$ also saturates in the QCL because the ability to modulate charge becomes limited by the channel's DOS, not by the gate insulator. Since both $g_m$ and $C_{gg}$ saturate as they become limited by $C_q$, their ratio, $f_T$, also approaches a saturation value. Initially, reducing $t_{ox}$ improves $f_T$, but this improvement diminishes and eventually ceases once the device is deep in the QCL. At this point, $f_T$ is limited by intrinsic channel properties such as carrier velocity, not by the gate oxide geometry.\n\n**Effect of reducing nanowire radius $r_w$:**\nReducing $r_w$ has two main effects. First, for a fixed $t_{ox}$, a smaller $r_w$ increases the ratio $t_{ox}/r_w$, which increases the logarithm in the denominator of $C_{ox}$ and thus weakly decreases $C_{ox}$. However, the dominant effect of reducing $r_w$ is the enhancement of quantum confinement in the 1D channel. This increases the energy separation between the quantized subbands.\n\nThe quantum capacitance $C_q$ depends on the DOS, which is a sum over the available subbands. When $r_w$ is reduced, the subband energies increase. For a given gate voltage and carrier concentration, the Fermi level may fall into a region with a lower total DOS, for example, if higher subbands are pushed too high in energy to be populated. A lower DOS results in a smaller $C_q$.\n\nTherefore, aggressive scaling of the nanowire radius $r_w$ can lead to a *reduction* in the quantum capacitance $C_q$. This is a fundamental limitation. A smaller $C_q$ provides a lower ceiling for both $C_{gg}$ and $g_m$. While the ratio $g_m/C_{gg}$ might seem insensitive as both are proportional to $C_q$ in the QCL, a reduced $C_q$ signifies a degradation in the fundamental charge-modulation capability of the channel, which can negatively impact the maximum achievable $f_T$. In summary, reducing $t_{ox}$ is generally beneficial for $f_T$ up to the QCL, whereas reducing $r_w$ improves electrostatic integrity (suppressing short-channel effects) but can ultimately limit performance by lowering the quantum capacitance.",
