            "problem": "A resonant tunneling diode (RTD) comprising a gallium arsenide (GaAs) quantum well between aluminum gallium arsenide ($\\text{Al}_x\\text{Ga}_{1-x}\\text{As}$) barriers relies on monolayer-level control of the well width to place the quasi-bound state in resonance with the emitter conduction band. Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) are the two dominant epitaxial techniques used for III–V semiconductor heterostructure growth. Briefly discuss, grounded in physical mechanisms of epitaxy, how MBE versus MOCVD differ in their capability for monolayer control, interface abruptness, and alloy disorder, and how these differences impact the resonance energy and linewidth in RTDs.\n\nThen, consider a GaAs/$\\text{Al}_{0.3}\\text{Ga}_{0.7}\\text{As}$ double-barrier RTD with a GaAs well of nominal width $L$ oriented along $(001)$. Assume the following:\n- The conduction band offset is sufficiently large, so that for the first bound state the infinite square well approximation is valid, i.e., $E_1 \\ll V_0$ for barrier height $V_0$.\n- The electron in the well can be described within the single-band effective mass approximation with effective mass $m^{\\ast} = 0.067\\,m_e$, where $m_e$ is the electron rest mass.\n- The GaAs lattice constant is $a_0 = 0.5653\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and a single monolayer step along $(001)$ changes the well width by $\\Delta L_{\\mathrm{ML}} = a_0/2$.\n- The target first resonance energy relative to the GaAs conduction band edge is $E_{\\mathrm{target}} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and the acceptable energy tolerance is $\\delta E = 0.003\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nStarting from the time-independent one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass $m^{\\ast}$ in a square well of width $L$, derive the quantization condition for the bound state energies and obtain the expression for $E_n$ in the infinite square well limit. Use this to:\n1. Determine the nominal $L$ that places the $n=1$ level at $E_{\\mathrm{target}}$.\n2.

            "solution": "The physical origin of monolayer control and its impact on the resonance in resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) is rooted in how epitaxial methods implement flux control and surface kinetics. Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) utilizes thermal effusion of elemental sources in ultra-high vacuum with real-time surface monitoring via Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED). This enables sub-monolayer flux control and observation of RHEED oscillations, which directly count monolayer completion, yielding highly abrupt interfaces and minimal alloy disorder due to low adatom energy and surface-limited reactions. In contrast, Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) relies on precursor chemistry and gas-phase transport, where surface reactions, precursor decomposition, and hydrogen passivation introduce kinetic delays and longer saturation times, reducing interface abruptness. MOCVD can produce high-quality layers and excellent uniformity, but monolayer precision is more challenging, and alloy disorder (compositional fluctuations in $\\text{Al}_x\\text{Ga}_{1-x}\\text{As}$) can be comparatively larger. In RTDs, less abrupt interfaces and greater alloy disorder broaden the resonance (increased linewidth through elastic and inelastic scattering) and introduce fluctuations in the well energy due to variations in the local conduction band edge and effective mass. Therefore, the resonance energy and its reproducibility are more sensitive to monolayer-scale errors and alloy disorder, favoring MBE when sub-monolayer precision is required.\n\nWe now perform the requested calculation using fundamental quantum mechanics for a particle in a one-dimensional square well.

            "problem": "Consider a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) based on a double-barrier heterostructure exhibiting Negative Differential Resistance (NDR). In steady-state direct current operation at the valley bias (the bias corresponding to the valley of the current–voltage characteristic), the off-resonant tunneling current through the active region is spatially uniform and can be described by a valley current density $J_{v,0}$ that scales with the device area. In addition, due to etched sidewalls and Fermi-level pinning, edge-localized states form a parasitic conduction channel along the perimeter that is Ohmic under the valley bias with an effective linear conductance per unit length $g_{\\ell}$. Treat the total valley current as the sum of the uniform off-resonant tunneling contribution and the edge-channel contribution. At the peak bias (the bias corresponding to the resonant peak), the current density is $J_{p}$ and is uniform across the active area.\n\nAssume a square mesa of side length $L$ patterned into the RTD active region.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of a square resonant tunneling diode (RTD) as a function of its area $A$. The PVR is defined as the ratio of the peak current, $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, to the valley current, $I_{\\mathrm{valley}}$. We must construct expressions for these two currents based on the physical model provided.\n\nFirst, let us define the currents based on the given parameters. The device is a square mesa with side length $L$. Its area is $A = L^2$ and its perimeter is $P = 4L$.\n\nThe peak current, $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, occurs at the peak bias voltage. The problem states that at this bias, the current density, $J_p$, is uniform across the active area $A$. The total current is therefore the product of the current density and the area:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = J_p A$$\n\nNext, we consider the valley current, $I_{\\mathrm{valley}}$, which occurs at the valley bias voltage, $V_v$. The problem specifies that this current is composed of two parallel contributions: a uniform off-resonant tunneling current through the bulk of the device and a parasitic leakage current along the etched perimeter.\n\nThe first component is the area-dependent off-resonant tunneling current, which we denote as $I_{v, \\text{area}}$. This is described by a uniform valley current density, $J_{v,0}$. Similar to the peak current, this contribution is the product of its density and the device area:\n$$I_{v, \\text{area}} = J_{v,0} A$$\n\nThe second component is the edge-channel contribution, $I_{v, \\text{edge}}$. This current flows through parasitic states along the perimeter of the mesa. The problem states that this channel behaves as an Ohmic conductor with an effective linear conductance per unit length, $g_{\\ell}$. The total conductance of the edge channel, $G_{\\text{edge}}$, is the product of this linear conductance and the total perimeter length, $P$:\n$$G_{\\text{edge}} = g_{\\ell} P$$\nThe current flowing through this channel is driven by the valley bias, $V_v$. According to Ohm's law, the edge current is:\n$$I_{v, \\text{edge}} = G_{\\text{edge}} V_v = (g_{\\ell} P) V_v$$\n\nTo express this current in terms of the area $A$, we need to relate the perimeter $P$ to the area $A$ for the square geometry.\nGiven $A = L^2$, the side length is $L = \\sqrt{A}$.\nThe perimeter is $P = 4L$, so we can substitute $L = \\sqrt{A}$ to get:\n$$P = 4\\sqrt{A}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the perimeter back into the equation for the edge current:\n$$I_{v, \\text{edge}} = g_{\\ell} (4\\sqrt{A}) V_v = 4 g_{\\ell} V_v \\sqrt{A}$$\n\nThe total valley current, $I_{\\mathrm{valley}}$, is the sum of the area-dependent and perimeter-dependent components, as the conduction paths are in parallel:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{valley}} = I_{v, \\text{area}} + I_{v, \\text{edge}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for each component:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{valley}} = J_{v,0} A + 4 g_{\\ell} V_v \\sqrt{A}$$\n\nFinally, we can construct the peak-to-valley ratio, $\\mathrm{PVR}$, using its definition, $\\mathrm{PVR} = I_{\\mathrm{peak}} / I_{\\mathrm{valley}}$.\n$$\\mathrm{PVR} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{I_{\\mathrm{valley}}} = \\frac{J_p A}{J_{v,0} A + 4 g_{\\ell} V_v \\sqrt{A}}$$\nThis expression gives the PVR as a function of the device area $A$ and the constants $J_p$, $J_{v,0}$, $g_{\\ell}$, and $V_v$.

This occurs when the imaginary part of $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is zero.\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{g_{d} + j\\omega C_{j}} + j\\omega L_{s}$$\nWe rationalize the first term:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega) = \\frac{g_{d} - j\\omega C_{j}}{g_{d}^2 + (\\omega C_j)^2} + j\\omega L_{s} = \\frac{g_{d}}{g_{d}^2 + \\omega^2 C_{j}^2} + j\\left(\\omega L_{s} - \\frac{\\omega C_{j}}{g_{d}^2 + \\omega^2 C_{j}^2}\\right)$$\nSetting the imaginary part to zero at $\\omega = \\omega_0$:\n$$\\mathrm{Im}\\{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0)\\} = \\omega_0 L_{s} - \\frac{\\omega_0 C_{j}}{g_{d}^2 + \\omega_0^2 C_{j}^2} = 0$$\nSince we are looking for a non-zero resonant frequency, we can divide by $\\omega_0$:\n$$L_{s} = \\frac{C_{j}}{g_{d}^2 + \\omega_0^2 C_{j}^2}$$\nNow, we solve for $\\omega_0^2$:\n$$L_{s}(g_{d}^2 + \\omega_0^2 C_{j}^2) = C_{j}$$\n$$L_{s}g_{d}^2 + L_{s}\\omega_0^2 C_{j}^2 = C_{j}$$\n$$\\omega_0^2 L_{s} C_{j}^2 = C_{j} - L_{s}g_{d}^2$$\n$$\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{C_{j} - L_{s}g_{d}^2}{L_{s} C_{j}^2} = \\frac{1}{L_{s}C_{j}} - \\left(\\frac{g_d}{C_j}\\right)^2$$\nWe substitute the extracted and given values: $g_d = -4.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}$, $C_j = 50.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$, and $L_s = 40.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{H}$.\n$$L_s C_j = (40.0 \\times 10^{-12})(50.0 \\times 10^{-15}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-24}\\,\\mathrm{s}^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{g_d}{C_j}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{-4.80 \\times 10^{-3}}{50.0 \\times 10^{-15}}\\right)^2 = \\left(-0.096 \\times 10^{12}\\right)^2 = 9.216 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $\\omega_0^2$:\n$$\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2.0 \\times 10^{-24}} - 9.216 \\times 10^{21} = 5.0 \\times 10^{23} - 0.09216 \\times 10^{23} = 4.90784 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2$$\nThe angular frequency $\\omega_0$ is the square root of this value:\n$$\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{4.90784 \\times 10^{23}} = \\sqrt{49.0784 \\times 10^{22}} \\approx 7.0056 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nThe self-resonant frequency $f_0$ is $\\omega_0/(2\\pi)$:\n$$f_0 = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi} \\approx \\frac{7.0056 \\times 10^{11}}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.11495 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 111.495\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the predicted self-resonant frequency is $111.5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\n### Part 4: Stability Condition at $\\omega_0$\nAt the resonant frequency $\\omega_0$, the input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0)$ is purely real. Let's denote it by $R_{\\mathrm{in},0}$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in},0} = \\mathrm{Re}\\{Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0)\\} = \\frac{g_{d}}{g_{d}^2 + \\omega_0^2 C_{j}^2}$$\nFrom the derivation in Part 3, we know that $g_{d}^2 + \\omega_0^2 C_{j}^2 = C_j/L_s$. Substituting this gives:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in},0} = \\frac{g_d}{C_j/L_s} = \\frac{g_d L_s}{C_j}$$\nNumerically:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in},0} = \\frac{(-4.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S})(40.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{H})}{50.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}} = -3.84\\,\\Omega$$\nThis negative resistance indicates the device is active at $\\omega_0$. The input admittance at this frequency is also purely real:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0) = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{in},0}} = \\frac{1}{-3.84\\,\\Omega} \\approx -0.2604\\,\\mathrm{S}$$\nWhen a shunt load conductance $G_L$ is connected at the input port, the total admittance of the loaded circuit is $Y_{\\mathrm{total}}(\\omega) = Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega) + G_L$. For small-signal stability, the real part of the total admittance must be positive for any frequency where oscillation might occur. At the resonant frequency $\\omega_0$, the total admittance is purely real: $Y_{\\mathrm{total}}(\\omega_0) = Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0) + G_L$.\nTo prevent oscillation at this frequency, the total conductance of the parallel circuit must be positive, which provides damping to any perturbation. The stability condition at $\\omega_0$ is therefore:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0) + G_L > 0$$\n$$G_L > -Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0) = -\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{in},0}} = -\\frac{C_j}{g_d L_s}$$\nThe threshold value of $G_L$ for stability at $\\omega_0$ is:\n$$G_{L, \\text{threshold}} = -Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega_0) = \\frac{1}{3.84\\,\\Omega} \\approx 0.2604\\,\\mathrm{S}$$\nThe condition is $G_L > G_{L, \\text{threshold}}$.\n\nThe question asks for the numerical value of $f_0$ in GHz, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$f_0 \\approx 111.5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$$",
