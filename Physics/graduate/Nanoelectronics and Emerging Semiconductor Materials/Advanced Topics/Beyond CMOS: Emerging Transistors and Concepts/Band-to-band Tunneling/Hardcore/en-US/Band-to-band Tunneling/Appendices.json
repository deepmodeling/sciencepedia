            "solution": "The problem statement describes a standard physical scenario of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) in a reverse-biased semiconductor homojunction and provides a complete, consistent, and physically plausible set of parameters. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be determined.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the width of the tunneling energy window. This window is defined by the range of energies for which there are occupied initial states on the $p^{+}$ side and available empty final states on the $n^{+}$ side. The tunneling process is elastic, meaning the electron's energy is conserved.\n\nWe are instructed to use the zero-temperature approximation for the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This implies:\n1.  On the $p^{+}$ side, the initial states in the valence band are considered fully occupied for energies $E$ up to the hole quasi-Fermi level, $E_{Fp}$. So, occupied states exist for $E \\leq E_{Fp}$.\n2.  On the $n^{+}$ side, the final states in the conduction band are considered completely empty for energies $E$ at or above the electron quasi-Fermi level, $E_{Fn}$. So, empty states exist for $E \\geq E_{Fn}$.\n\nFor tunneling to occur at a specific energy $E$, both conditions must be met simultaneously. Thus, the tunneling energy window is the set of energies $E$ satisfying $E_{Fn} \\leq E \\leq E_{Fp}$. The width of this window, $\\Delta E_{\\text{window}}$, is the difference between the upper and lower bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = E_{Fp} - E_{Fn}\n$$\nThis window is non-zero only if $E_{Fp} > E_{Fn}$.\n\nLet's establish the energy levels of the system. We will measure all energies in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) relative to the valence band edge on the $p^{+}$ side, which we set as the reference energy:\n$$\nE_{v,p}(0) = 0\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe conduction band edge on the $p^{+}$ side is then:\n$$\nE_{c,p}(0) = E_{v,p}(0) + E_{g} = E_{g}\n$$\nwhere $E_{g} = 0.354\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is the bandgap energy.\n\nThe problem provides the position of the hole quasi-Fermi level on the $p^{+}$ side as:\n$$\nE_{Fp} = E_{v,p}(0) - 0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nSubstituting our reference energy, we get the upper bound of the tunneling window:\n$$\nE_{Fp} = 0\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV} = -0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe condition that initial states lie within the valence band at the source ($E \\leq E_{v,p}(0)$) is satisfied, as $E_{Fp} = -0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\leq 0\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nNext, we determine the energy levels on the $n^{+}$ side. A reverse bias of $V_{R} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}$ is applied across the intrinsic region. This raises the potential on the $n^{+}$ side relative to the $p^{+}$ side, causing the electron energy bands on the $n^{+}$ side to be lowered by an amount $qV_{R}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge. In units of electronvolts, this energy shift is numerically equal to $V_R$.\nThe conduction band edge on the $n^{+}$ side, $E_{c,n}(d)$, is therefore:\n$$\nE_{c,n}(d) = E_{c,p}(0) - qV_{R} = E_{g} - qV_{R}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nE_{c,n}(d) = 0.354\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} = -0.146\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe problem provides the position of the electron quasi-Fermi level on the $n^{+}$ side as:\n$$\nE_{Fn} = E_{c,n}(d) + 0.030\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis gives the lower bound of the tunneling window:\n$$\nE_{Fn} = -0.146\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.030\\ \\mathrm{eV} = -0.116\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe condition that final states lie within the conduction band at the destination ($E \\geq E_{c,n}(d)$) is satisfied, as $E_{Fn} = -0.116\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\geq -0.146\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nSince $E_{Fp} = -0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is greater than $E_{Fn} = -0.116\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, a tunneling window exists. Now we can calculate its width:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = E_{Fp} - E_{Fn} = (-0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV}) - (-0.116\\ \\mathrm{eV})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = -0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.116\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.096\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, we can derive a symbolic expression for the window width. Let $\\delta_p = E_{v,p}(0) - E_{Fp} = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\delta_n = E_{Fn} - E_{c,n}(d) = 0.030\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe width is $\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = E_{Fp} - E_{Fn}$.\nSubstituting the definitions:\n$$\nE_{Fp} = E_{v,p}(0) - \\delta_p\n$$\n$$\nE_{Fn} = E_{c,n}(d) + \\delta_n = (E_{c,p}(0) - qV_R) + \\delta_n = (E_{v,p}(0) + E_g - qV_R) + \\delta_n\n$$\nSo, the width is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = (E_{v,p}(0) - \\delta_p) - (E_{v,p}(0) + E_g - qV_R + \\delta_n)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = qV_R - E_g - \\delta_p - \\delta_n\n$$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.354\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.020\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.030\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} - (0.354 + 0.020 + 0.030)\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{window}} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.404\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.096\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nWe begin by solving Poisson's equation to find the electric field profile $F(x)$ across the depletion region.\n\n**1. Electric Field in the $p$-side Depletion Region ($-x_{p} \\le x \\le 0$)**\nThe Poisson equation is $\\frac{d F}{d x} = \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$F(x) = \\int \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} dx = \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x + C_{1}$$\nUsing the boundary condition $F(-x_{p}) = 0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{-q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} (-x_{p}) + C_{1} \\implies C_{1} = -\\frac{q N_{A} x_{p}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$$\nThus, the electric field in the $p$-side is:\n$$F(x) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} (x + x_{p})$$\n\n**2. Electric Field in the $n$-side Depletion Region ($0 \\le x \\le x_{n}$)**\nThe Poisson equation is $\\frac{d F}{d x} = \\frac{+q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$.\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$F(x) = \\int \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} dx = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x + C_{2}$$\nUsing the boundary condition $F(x_{n}) = 0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x_{n} + C_{2} \\implies C_{2} = -\\frac{q N_{D} x_{n}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$$\nThus, the electric field in the $n$-side is:\n$$F(x) = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} (x - x_{n})$$\n\n**3. Peak Electric Field and Charge Neutrality**\nThe electric field must be continuous at the metallurgical junction, $x = 0$.\n$$F(x=0^{-}) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x_{p}$$\n$$F(x=0^{+}) = -\\frac{q N_{D}}{\\epsilon_{s}} x_{n}$$\nEquating these gives the charge neutrality condition for the depletion region:\n$$-\\frac{q N_{A} x_{p}}{\\epsilon_{s}} = -\\frac{q N_{D} x_{n}}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\implies q N_{A} x_{p} = q N_{D} x_{n}$$\nThe field is maximal at $x=0$. The peak field magnitude is $F_{\\max} = |F(0)|$:\n$$F_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{A} x_{p}}{\\epsilon_{s}} = \\frac{q N_{D} x_{n}}{\\epsilon_{s}}$$\n\n**4. Total Potential Drop and Depletion Width**\nThe total potential drop $V$ across the junction is the integral of the electric field from $-x_{p}$ to $x_{n}$. Geometrically, this is the area of the triangular-shaped field profile.\n$$V = -\\int_{-x_{p}}^{x_{n}} F(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base}) \\times (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} (x_{p} + x_{n}) F_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} W F_{\\max}$$\n\n**5. Expressing $F_{\\max}$ and $W$ in terms of $V$**\nWe need to relate $W$ and $F_{\\max}$ to the doping concentrations. From the charge neutrality condition $N_{A} x_{p} = N_{D} x_{n}$ and the total width $W = x_{p} + x_{n}$, we can solve for $x_{p}$ and $x_{n}$:\n$$x_{p} = W \\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_{n} = W \\frac{N_{A}}{N_{A} + N_{D}}$$\nSubstitute the expression for $x_{p}$ into the equation for $F_{\\max}$:\n$$F_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\left( W \\frac{N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\right) = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} W$$\nWe now have a system of two equations relating $V$, $W$, and $F_{\\max}$:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} W F_{\\max}$$\n$$F_{\\max} = \\left( \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\right) W$$\nFrom the second equation, we express $W$ in terms of $F_{\\max}$:\n$$W = F_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ F_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} \\right) \\right] F_{\\max} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} F_{\\max}^{2}$$\nSolving for $F_{\\max}$ in terms of $V$:\n$$F_{\\max}^{2} = \\frac{2qV}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}} \\implies F_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}}}$$\nTo find $W$ in terms of $V$, we use $W = 2V/F_{\\max}$:\n$$W = \\frac{2V}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{A} N_{D}}{N_{A} + N_{D}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4V^{2} \\epsilon_{s} (N_{A} + N_{D})}{2qV N_{A} N_{D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2V\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}}}$$\n\n**6. Deriving the Minimum Reverse Bias for BTBT**\nThe condition for the onset of strong BTBT is that the peak field reaches the critical value, $F_{\\max} = F_{c}$. We use the relationship derived between the total potential $V$ and $F_{\\max}$:\n$$V = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} F_{\\max}^{2}$$\nAt the onset of tunneling, we set $F_{\\max} = F_{c}$ and the corresponding total potential is $V = V_{bi} + V_{R}^{\\star}$:\n$$V_{bi} + V_{R}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s} F_{c}^{2}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}}$$\nSolving for the minimum required reverse bias, $V_{R}^{\\star}$:\n$$V_{R}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s} F_{c}^{2}}{2q} \\frac{N_{A} + N_{D}}{N_{A} N_{D}} - V_{bi}$$\nThe expression can also be written as:\n$$V_{R}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{s} F_{c}^{2}}{2q} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{A}} + \\frac{1}{N_{D}} \\right) - V_{bi}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the required reverse bias.",

These lengths are the distances from the junction where the generation rate drops to a fraction $\\alpha$ of its peak value, $G(0)$.\nThe peak generation rate occurs where the electric field magnitude is maximum, i.e., at $x=0$:\n$$ G(0) = G_0 \\exp\\left(-B/|E(0)|\\right) = G_0 \\exp\\left(-B/|E_{max}|\\right) $$\nThe condition defining the boundaries is $G(x) = \\alpha G(0)$:\n$$ G_0 \\exp\\left(-B/|E(x)|\\right) = \\alpha \\left( G_0 \\exp\\left(-B/|E_{max}|\\right) \\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{B}{|E(x)|} = \\ln(\\alpha) - \\frac{B}{|E_{max}|} $$\n$$ \\frac{B}{|E(x)|} = \\frac{B}{|E_{max}|} - \\ln(\\alpha) = \\frac{B}{|E_{max}|} + \\ln(1/\\alpha) $$\nThis equation defines a constant threshold field magnitude, let's call it $|E_{thresh}|$, at which the generation rate is $\\alpha G(0)$.\n$$ |E(x)| = |E_{thresh}| \\quad \\text{where} \\quad |E_{thresh}| = \\frac{B}{\\frac{B}{|E_{max}|} + \\ln(1/\\alpha)} $$\nNote that since $0  \\alpha  1$, we have $\\ln(1/\\alpha)  0$, which ensures $|E_{thresh}|  |E_{max}|$.\n\nWe now find the locations on both sides of the junction where $|E(x)| = |E_{thresh}|$.\nOn the $n$-side, we are looking for a position $x = L_n(\\alpha)  0$.\n$$ |E(L_n(\\alpha))| = \\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon} (W_n - L_n(\\alpha)) = |E_{thresh}| $$\n$$ W_n - L_n(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{thresh}|}{q N_D} $$\n$$ L_n(\\alpha) = W_n - \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{thresh}|}{q N_D} $$\nWe can express $W_n$ in terms of $|E_{max}|$: $W_n = \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{max}|}{q N_D}$.\n$$ L_n(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{max}|}{q N_D} - \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{thresh}|}{q N_D} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{q N_D} (|E_{max}| - |E_{thresh}|) $$\n\nOn the $p$-side, we are looking for a position $x  0$ whose distance from the junction is $L_p(\\alpha)$, i.e., $x = -L_p(\\alpha)$.\n$$ |E(-L_p(\\alpha))| = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon} (-L_p(\\alpha) + W_p) = |E_{thresh}| $$\n$$ W_p - L_p(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{thresh}|}{q N_A} $$\n$$ L_p(\\alpha) = W_p - \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{thresh}|}{q N_A} $$\nSimilarly, we express $W_p$ in terms of $|E_{max}|$: $W_p = \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{max}|}{q N_A}$.\n$$ L_p(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{max}|}{q N_A} - \\frac{\\varepsilon |E_{thresh}|}{q N_A} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{q N_A} (|E_{max}| - |E_{thresh}|) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = L_n(\\alpha)/L_p(\\alpha)$.\n$$ R = \\frac{L_n(\\alpha)}{L_p(\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{q N_D} (|E_{max}| - |E_{thresh}|)}{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{q N_A} (|E_{max}| - |E_{thresh}|)} $$\nThe term $(|E_{max}| - |E_{thresh}|)$ and the constants $\\varepsilon/q$ cancel out, provided $|E_{thresh}|  |E_{max}|$, which is true.\n$$ R = \\frac{1/N_D}{1/N_A} = \\frac{N_A}{N_D} $$\nThe ratio is independent of the parameter $\\alpha$ and all other physical constants, depending only on the doping concentrations.\nThe two quantities to be computed are $x_{\\text{peak}} = 0$ and $R = N_A/N_D$. The problem asks for $x_{\\text{peak}}$ in nanometers, which is $0$ nm.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix containing $x_{\\text{peak}}$ and $R$.",
