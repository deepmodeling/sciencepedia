It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The given physical parameters are realistic for the GaN-on-diamond material system in high-power electronics.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the equivalent Kapitza length, $L_{K}$, and its physical interpretation. The derivation begins from the fundamental laws governing heat conduction in the bulk material and across the interface.\n\n1.  **Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction:** For one-dimensional, steady-state heat flow, the heat flux $q''$ (in units of $\\mathrm{W \\ m^{-2}}$) through a material is related to the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ and the material's thermal conductivity $k$ by Fourier's Law:\n    $$q'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\n    For a layer of material with a constant thermal conductivity $k$ and thickness $L$, across which a constant heat flux $q''$ flows, the law can be integrated to find the temperature drop, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{layer}}$, across the layer:\n    $$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{layer}} = q'' \\frac{L}{k}$$\n\n2.  **Definition of Thermal Boundary Resistance (Kapitza Resistance):** The thermal boundary resistance, $R_K$ (in units of $\\mathrm{m^2 \\ K \\ W^{-1}}$), defines the relationship between the heat flux $q''$ crossing an interface and the resulting abrupt temperature discontinuity, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{int}}$, at that interface:\n    $$R_K = \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{int}}}{q''}$$\n    Therefore, the temperature drop across the interface can be expressed as:\n    $$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{int}} = q'' R_K$$\n\n3.  **Derivation of the Equivalent Kapitza Length, $L_K$:** The problem defines $L_{K}$ as the thickness of the gallium nitride (GaN) layer that would produce the same temperature drop as the GaN/diamond interface under the same heat flux. To find the expression for $L_K$, we equate the temperature drop across this hypothetical GaN layer of thickness $L_K$ with the temperature drop across the interface.\n    $$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{layer}}(L=L_K) = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{int}}$$\n    Substituting the expressions from steps $1$ and $2$, using the thermal conductivity of GaN, $k_{\\mathrm{GaN}}$:\n    $$q'' \\frac{L_K}{k_{\\mathrm{GaN}}} = q'' R_K$$\n    Assuming a non-zero heat flux ($q'' \\neq 0$), we can cancel $q''$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $$\\frac{L_K}{k_{\\mathrm{GaN}}} = R_K$$\n    Solving for $L_K$ yields the desired analytical expression:\n    $$L_K = k_{\\mathrm{GaN}} R_K$$\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation of $L_K$:** We now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression.\n    -   $k_{\\mathrm{GaN}} = 160 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$\n    -   $R_{K} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2} \\ K \\ W^{-1}}$\n    \n    $$L_K = (160 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2} \\ K \\ W^{-1}})$$\n    $$L_K = 400 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n    $$L_K = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\n5.  **Unit Conversion and Final Answer:** The problem requires the final value to be expressed in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$). Using the conversion $1 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$:\n    $$L_K = (4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (10^9 \\ \\mathrm{nm \\ m^{-1}})$$\n    $$L_K = 4.0 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 4000 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n    The problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $4000$. To express this with three significant figures of precision, we write it in scientific notation as $4.00 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n6.  **Physical Interpretation:** The final step is to interpret the meaning of this result by comparing $L_K$ to the actual GaN layer thickness, $t_{\\mathrm{GaN}} = 500 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The computed Kapitza length of $4000 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ signifies that the thermal resistance of the GaN/diamond interface is equivalent to the thermal resistance of an additional $4000 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ of GaN, and since this value is eight times larger than the actual GaN layer thickness of $500 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ ($4000/500 = 8$), the interface is the dominant contributor to the total through-thickness thermal resistance under these conditions.",

            "problem": "A metallic line heater of width $w$ and length $L_h$ is patterned atop a thin film of thickness $L$ composed of an emerging semiconductor material. The film has intrinsic cross-plane thermal conductivity $k$ and volumetric heat capacity $C_f$. The film is supported on a semi-infinite crystalline substrate whose thermal properties are sufficiently high that, in the low-frequency limit described below, its temperature at the film–substrate interface can be treated as fixed at $T_0$. The film–substrate interface exhibits a finite thermal boundary resistance (Kapitza resistance), denoted $R_K$, which produces a temperature discontinuity proportional to the local heat flux crossing the interface. In a three-omega (3$\\omega$) measurement, the heater is driven by an alternating current at angular frequency $\\omega$, producing an oscillatory Joule heating with angular frequency $2\\omega$ and surface heat flux amplitude $q_0$ into the film.\n\nAssume the following measurement regime and idealizations are satisfied:\n\n- The heat flow is one-dimensional and cross-plane in the film, aligned with the film thickness direction $x$, with $x=0$ at the heater–film surface and $x=L$ at the film–substrate interface.\n- The thermal penetration depth in the film at angular frequency $2\\omega$, defined as $\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha_f}{2\\omega}}$ with $\\alpha_f = \\frac{k}{C_f}$, is much larger than $L$, so that the film behaves quasi-statically within each oscillation and the cross-plane temperature profile is approximately linear at the oscillation timescale.\n- The substrate acts as an isothermal sink at the interface in this low-frequency limit, so the substrate-side interfacial temperature is $T_0$.\n\nStarting from the one-dimensional energy conservation and Fourier’s law of heat conduction in the film, together with the interfacial boundary condition that relates the temperature discontinuity to the interfacial heat flux through the Kapitza resistance, derive the relationship between the measured oscillatory surface temperature amplitude at the heater, $\\Delta T$, and the applied heat flux amplitude $q_0$, in terms of $k$, $L$, and $R_K$, under the stated quasi-static conditions.

The setup described is a standard idealization of the $3\\omega$ method for thin film characterization. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient assumptions (1D flow, quasi-static limit) to permit a unique, analytic solution without internal contradictions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\n\nThe objective is to first derive the relationship between the heater temperature oscillation amplitude, $\\Delta T$, and the applied heat flux amplitude, $q_0$, then to find the expression for the apparent thermal conductivity, $k_{\\mathrm{app}}$, and finally to propose a measurement strategy to decouple $k$ and $R_K$.\n\nLet $\\Delta T(x)$ represent the amplitude of the oscillatory temperature component at position $x$ within the film. The total temperature at any point is $T(x,t) = T_{DC}(x) + \\Delta T(x) \\exp(i2\\omega t)$, and the heat flux is $q(x,t) = q_{DC} + q_{AC}(x) \\exp(i2\\omega t)$. We are concerned with the amplitudes of the AC components.\n\nThe assumption of a quasi-static regime ($\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha_f}{2\\omega}} \\gg L$) implies that the heat stored within the film due to its heat capacity is negligible during an oscillation cycle. This means the heat flux is approximately uniform across the film's thickness. Thus, the AC heat flux amplitude is constant, $q_{AC}(x) = q_0$, for $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n\nUnder steady-state or quasi-static one-dimensional heat flow, Fourier's law of heat conduction is given by:\n$$q_0 = -k \\frac{d(\\Delta T(x))}{dx}$$\nThis differential equation implies that the temperature profile is linear with respect to $x$. We can integrate this equation from the surface ($x=0$) to an arbitrary depth $x$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{x} q_0 \\,dx' = \\int_{\\Delta T(0)}^{\\Delta T(x)} -k \\,d(\\Delta T')$$\n$$q_0 x = -k (\\Delta T(x) - \\Delta T(0))$$\nThe problem defines $\\Delta T$ as the measured surface temperature amplitude, so $\\Delta T \\equiv \\Delta T(0)$. Rearranging the equation gives the temperature profile:\n$$\\Delta T(x) = \\Delta T(0) - \\frac{q_0}{k}x = \\Delta T - \\frac{q_0 x}{k}$$\nThis expression describes the temperature oscillation amplitude at any point $x$ inside the film.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at the film–substrate interface ($x=L$). The thermal boundary resistance $R_K$ is defined by the temperature discontinuity across the interface, which is proportional to the heat flux crossing it:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{film}}(L) - \\Delta T_{\\text{substrate}}(L) = q_0 R_K$$\nHere, $\\Delta T_{\\text{film}}(L)$ is the temperature amplitude on the film side of the interface, and $\\Delta T_{\\text{substrate}}(L)$ is the temperature amplitude on the substrate side. According to the problem statement, the substrate acts as an isothermal sink in this low-frequency limit, meaning its temperature does not oscillate. Therefore, $\\Delta T_{\\text{substrate}}(L) = 0$. The boundary condition simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{film}}(L) = q_0 R_K$$\nWe can also find $\\Delta T_{\\text{film}}(L)$ by evaluating our derived temperature profile at $x=L$:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{film}}(L) = \\Delta T(L) = \\Delta T - \\frac{q_0 L}{k}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\Delta T_{\\text{film}}(L)$:\n$$q_0 R_K = \\Delta T - \\frac{q_0 L}{k}$$\nSolving for the measured surface temperature amplitude $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\Delta T = q_0 R_K + \\frac{q_0 L}{k}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta T}{q_0} = \\frac{L}{k} + R_K$$\nThis is the desired relationship. It shows that the total measured thermal resistance ($\\frac{\\Delta T}{q_0}$) is the series sum of the film's intrinsic thermal resistance ($\\frac{L}{k}$) and the interface thermal resistance ($R_K$).\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the apparent thermal conductivity, $k_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The problem states this is obtained by the flawed practice of neglecting $R_K$ and attributing the entire measured thermal resistance to the film:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta T}{q_0} = \\frac{L}{k_{\\mathrm{app}}}$$\nBy equating the physically correct expression for the total resistance with the one used to define $k_{\\mathrm{app}}$, we get:\n$$\\frac{L}{k_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{L}{k} + R_K$$\nTo solve for $k_{\\mathrm{app}}$, we first find a common denominator on the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{L}{k_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{L + k R_K}{k}$$\nInverting both sides and multiplying by $L$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{app}} = L \\left( \\frac{k}{L + k R_K} \\right)$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{kL}{L + kR_K}$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the apparent thermal conductivity in terms of the true conductivity $k$, the film thickness $L$, and the Kapitza resistance $R_K$. As expected, $k_{\\mathrm{app}}  k$ because $R_K  0$.\n\nFinally, we propose a measurement strategy to decouple $k$ and $R_K$. The relationship derived, $R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{q_0} = \\frac{L}{k} + R_K$, contains two unknowns, $k$ and $R_K$. To solve for both, one must perform a series of measurements where a parameter is varied. The film thickness $L$ is a suitable parameter.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  Fabricate a set of samples with varying film thicknesses $L_i$ ($i=1, 2, ..., N$), while keeping the material composition and interface properties (and thus $k$ and $R_K$) constant across all samples.\n2.  For each sample, perform the low-frequency $3\\omega$ measurement to obtain the total thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{total}, i} = \\frac{\\Delta T_i}{q_{0,i}}$.\n3.  Plot the measured total resistance $R_{\\text{total}, i}$ as a function of the film thickness $L_i$.\n4.  The governing equation, $R_{\\text{total}} = (\\frac{1}{k})L + R_K$, is in the form of a linear equation $y = mx + c$.\n    -   The dependent variable $y$ is the measured total resistance $R_{\\text{total}}$.\n    -   The independent variable $x$ is the film thickness $L$.\n    -   The slope $m$ is the reciprocal of the intrinsic thermal conductivity, $m = \\frac{1}{k}$.\n    -   The y-intercept $c$ is the thermal boundary resistance, $c = R_K$.\n5.  By performing a linear least-squares fit to the experimental data points ($L_i, R_{\\text{total}, i}$), one can extract the slope and y-intercept. The intrinsic thermal conductivity is then calculated as $k = \\frac{1}{\\text{slope}}$, and the thermal boundary resistance is directly given by the y-intercept. This method effectively decouples the bulk and interface thermal resistances.",

It is the integral over phonon modes of the energy per phonon, the group velocity normal to the interface, the transmission probability, and the difference in phonon occupation numbers.\nFor a small temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_1 - T_2$, where $T_1 = T + \\Delta T/2$ and $T_2 = T - \\Delta T/2$, the Bose-Einstein distribution difference can be linearized: $f(\\omega, T_1) - f(\\omega, T_2) \\approx \\frac{\\partial f(\\omega, T)}{\\partial T} \\Delta T$. The thermal boundary conductance $G$ is defined as $G = J_Q / \\Delta T$.\n\nThe general expression for conductance, summing over all phonon polarizations $p$ (one longitudinal $l$, two transverse $t$) in material 1, is:\n$$\nG = \\sum_{p \\in \\{1\\}} \\int_{v_{p,z}0} \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\alpha_{1\\to 2, p}(\\mathbf{k}) \\hbar\\omega_p(\\mathbf{k}) v_{p,z}(\\mathbf{k}) \\frac{\\partial f(\\omega_p, T)}{\\partial T}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{1\\to 2, p}$ is the transmission probability for a phonon of polarization $p$ and wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ from material 1 to 2, $\\hbar\\omega_p(\\mathbf{k})$ is the phonon energy, $v_{p,z}(\\mathbf{k})$ is the group velocity component normal to the interface, and $f(\\omega, T) = (e^{\\hbar\\omega/k_B T} - 1)^{-1}$ is the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n\nWithin the Debye approximation for an isotropic solid, the dispersion is linear, $\\omega_p = v_p k$, and the group velocity $v_p$ is constant for each polarization. We can transform the integral over wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ to an integral over frequency $\\omega$. In spherical coordinates, $d^3k = k^2 \\sin\\theta \\,dk\\,d\\theta\\,d\\phi$ and $v_{p,z} = v_p \\cos\\theta$. Integrating over the hemisphere of phonons incident on the interface ($0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi/2$) gives:\n$$\nG = \\sum_{p \\in \\{1\\}} \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 v_{p,1}^2} \\int_0^{\\omega_{\\max}} \\omega^2 \\left( \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\alpha_{1\\to 2, p}(\\omega, \\theta) \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta \\right) \\hbar\\omega \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} \\, d\\omega\n$$\nWe define an angle-averaged transmission probability $\\langle\\alpha_{p}(\\omega)\\rangle = 2 \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\alpha_{1\\to 2, p}(\\omega, \\theta) \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nG = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} \\sum_{p \\in \\{1\\}} \\frac{1}{v_{p,1}^2} \\int_0^{\\omega_{\\max}} \\omega^2 \\langle\\alpha_{p}(\\omega)\\rangle \\hbar\\omega \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} \\, d\\omega\n$$\nThe sum is over the polarizations in material 1: $\\sum_{p \\in \\{1\\}} \\rightarrow \\frac{\\langle\\alpha_{l}\\rangle}{v_{l,1}^2} + \\frac{2\\langle\\alpha_{t}\\rangle}{v_{t,1}^2}$. The upper integration limit $\\omega_{\\max}$ is the minimum of the Debye cutoff frequencies of the two materials, $\\omega_{\\max} = \\min(k_B\\Theta_{D,1}/\\hbar, k_B\\Theta_{D,2}/\\hbar)$, as phonons must be able to propagate on both sides.\n\nTo obtain a dimensionless integral, we substitute $x = \\hbar\\omega / (k_B T)$. This gives $d\\omega = (k_B T / \\hbar) dx$, $\\omega^2 = (k_B T x / \\hbar)^2$, and the kernel $\\hbar\\omega \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} = k_B \\frac{x^2 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2}$. The conductance becomes:\n$$\nG = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{8\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\left( \\frac{\\langle\\alpha_{l}\\rangle}{v_{l,1}^2} + \\frac{2\\langle\\alpha_{t}\\rangle}{v_{t,1}^2} \\right) \\int_0^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} \\, dx\n$$\nwhere $x_{\\max} = \\hbar\\omega_{\\max}/(k_B T) = \\min(\\Theta_{D,1}, \\Theta_{D,2})/T$. This form applies when $\\langle\\alpha_p\\rangle$ is independent of frequency, which is true for both DMM and the specified AMM simplification.\n\n**1. Diffuse Mismatch Model (DMM)**\n\nThe DMM assumes that all phonons incident on the interface are scattered diffusely, losing all memory of their origin. The probability of transmission into material 2 is the ratio of the flux of available modes in material 2 to the total flux of available modes in both materials. The mode flux rate per unit area per unit frequency is proportional to $\\sum_p 1/v_p^2$.\nThus, the transmission probability $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{DMM}}$ is independent of incident polarization, angle, and frequency:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\mathrm{DMM}} = \\frac{\\sum_{p \\in \\{2\\}} 1/v_{p,2}^2}{\\sum_{p \\in \\{1\\}} 1/v_{p,1}^2 + \\sum_{p \\in \\{2\\}} 1/v_{p,2}^2} = \\frac{1/v_{\\ell,2}^2 + 2/v_{t,2}^2}{(1/v_{\\ell,1}^2 + 2/v_{t,1}^2) + (1/v_{\\ell,2}^2 + 2/v_{t,2}^2)}\n$$\nSince $\\langle\\alpha_{l}\\rangle = \\langle\\alpha_{t}\\rangle = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{DMM}}$, we substitute this into the general expression for $G$:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{DMM}} = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{8\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\left( \\frac{1}{v_{\\ell,1}^2} + \\frac{2}{v_{t,1}^2} \\right) \\alpha_{\\mathrm{DMM}} \\int_0^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2} \\, dx\n$$\nThis simplifies to a symmetric form:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{DMM}} = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{8\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{v_{\\ell,1}^2} + \\frac{2}{v_{t,1}^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{v_{\\ell,2}^2} + \\frac{2}{v_{t,2}^2} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{1}{v_{\\ell,1}^2} + \\frac{2}{v_{t,1}^2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{v_{\\ell,2}^2} + \\frac{2}{v_{t,2}^2} \\right)} \\int_0^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} \\, dx\n$$\n\n**2. Acoustic Mismatch Model (AMM)**\n\nThe AMM treats phonons as plane waves at a specular interface. The problem specifies using a simplified model that neglects mode conversion and is polarization-resolved. This typically implies using the transmission coefficient for normal incidence, which depends on the acoustic impedance $Z_p = \\rho v_p$. The energy transmission coefficient for a wave of polarization $p$ from material 1 to 2 is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{p, 1\\to 2} = \\frac{4 Z_{p,1} Z_{p,2}}{(Z_{p,1} + Z_{p,2})^2}\n$$\nThis value is independent of angle and frequency, so we set $\\langle\\alpha_{p}\\rangle = \\alpha_{p, 1\\to 2}$. We compute this separately for longitudinal ($p=l$) and transverse ($p=t$) polarizations:\n$$\n\\alpha_{l} = \\frac{4 (\\rho_1 v_{\\ell,1})(\\rho_2 v_{\\ell,2})}{(\\rho_1 v_{\\ell,1} + \\rho_2 v_{\\ell,2})^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha_{t} = \\frac{4 (\\rho_1 v_{t,1})(\\rho_2 v_{t,2})}{(\\rho_1 v_{t,1} + \\rho_2 v_{t,2})^2}\n$$\nThe conductance is then:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{AMM}} = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{8\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_{l}}{v_{\\ell,1}^2} + \\frac{2\\alpha_{t}}{v_{t,1}^2} \\right) \\int_0^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} \\, dx\n$$\nIt is important to note that this formulation for $G_{\\mathrm{AMM}}$ is not symmetric with respect to interchange of materials 1 and 2, which is a known artifact of this simplification. The calculation is performed from the perspective of flux originating in material 1.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nFor each test case, we will numerically evaluate the definite integral $I(x_{\\max}) = \\int_0^{x_{\\max}} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2} \\, dx$ and combine it with the material-dependent prefactors for DMM and AMM.\nThe constants are Boltzmann constant $k_B=1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$ and reduced Planck constant $\\hbar=1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$.\nThe temperature is $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.",
