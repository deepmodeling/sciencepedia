It is a standard application of a well-established physical model.\n-   **Action**: Proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe rate of a thermally activated process, $R$, is described by the Arrhenius equation, where the rate is proportional to an exponential factor involving the activation energy, $W$, and the thermal energy, $k_B T$:\n$$R \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the defect creation rate, $R_{cr}$, follows this behavior, and the activation energy, $W(E)$, is a function of the electric field $E$:\n$$W(E) = W_0 - \\alpha E$$\nSubstituting this expression for the activation energy into the Arrhenius relation for the defect creation rate gives:\n$$R_{cr}(E) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_0 - \\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe exponential term can be separated:\n$$R_{cr}(E) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe problem defines the time-to-failure, $\\mathrm{TTF}(E)$, as being inversely proportional to the defect creation rate:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) \\propto \\frac{1}{R_{cr}(E)}$$\nTherefore, the field dependence of $\\mathrm{TTF}(E)$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSince the temperature $T$ is constant, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{W_0}{k_B T}\\right)$ is also a constant. We can combine this with the proportionality constant into a single pre-factor, $A_0$. This leads to the exponential field dependence known as the $E$-model:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k_B T} E\\right)$$\nThis model is conventionally written in the form:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E)$$\nBy comparing the derived expression with the conventional form, we identify the field acceleration factor, $\\gamma$, as:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\alpha}{k_B T}$$\nThis confirms that $\\gamma$ encapsulates the sensitivity of the failure time to the electric field, which is determined by the material's barrier-lowering parameter $\\alpha$ relative to the available thermal energy $k_B T$.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $\\gamma$ from the experimental data, we use the model equation for the two given data points:\n$$ \\mathrm{TTF}_1 = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_1) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{TTF}_2 = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_2) $$\nTo eliminate the unknown pre-factor $A_0$, we take the ratio of these two equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2} = \\frac{A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_1)}{A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_2)} = \\exp(-\\gamma E_1 - (-\\gamma E_2)) = \\exp(\\gamma(E_2 - E_1)) $$\nTo solve for $\\gamma$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2}\\right) = \\gamma(E_2 - E_1) $$\nIsolating $\\gamma$ yields the final expression for its calculation:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2}\\right)}{E_2 - E_1} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression. The units of time for $\\mathrm{TTF}$ will cancel.

Local Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability of the fixed point, we analyze the system's response to small perturbations. This is done by linearizing the system dynamics around $(T^\\ast, n^\\ast)$ using the Jacobian matrix $J$:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial n} \\end{pmatrix}_{T=T^\\ast, n=n^\\ast} $$\nwhere $f(T,n) = dT/dt$ and $g(T,n) = dn/dt$. The fixed point is locally stable if and only if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix have strictly negative real parts. If any eigenvalue has a non-negative real part, the perturbations will grow, leading to an unstable runaway condition.\n\nThe procedure for each voltage $V$ is as follows:\n1.  Numerically solve the transcendental equation to find the fixed-point defect density $n^\\ast$.\n2.  Calculate the corresponding fixed-point temperature $T^\\ast$.\n3.  Evaluate the four components of the Jacobian matrix at $(T^\\ast, n^\\ast)$ using the expressions provided in the problem.\n4.  Compute the eigenvalues of the resulting $2 \\times 2$ matrix.\n5.  If both eigenvalues have negative real parts, the system is stable, and the output is the temperature $T^\\ast$. Otherwise, the system is unstable (runaway), and the output is $-1.0$.\n\nThis procedure is implemented in the provided code to generate the results for the test suite.",
