            "problem": "A monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide nanoribbon (for concreteness, a tungsten diselenide channel) forms a two-terminal mesoscopic constriction supporting a single, spin-degenerate quantum mode. A top gate tunes the elastic scattering potential so that the transmission probability of this mode is a gate-controlled parameter $T \\in [0,1]$. The device is operated at an electron temperature $\\theta_{\\mathrm{el}}$ satisfying $k_{B} \\theta_{\\mathrm{el}} \\ll e V$ with a constant direct current (DC) source-drain bias $V0$, so that thermal noise is negligible compared to partition (shot) noise.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a canonical scenario in mesoscopic physics—shot noise in a quantum point contact—using standard assumptions and definitions from the field of nanoelectronics. All necessary conditions are provided for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and I will proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the zero-frequency current-noise spectral density, $S_I(0)$, for a single spin-degenerate quantum mode with transmission probability $T$, under an applied bias voltage $V$. The system is at a sufficiently low temperature that thermal noise can be neglected ($k_B \\theta_{\\mathrm{el}} \\ll eV$). We begin from the Landauer picture of transport and the provided definition of noise in terms of charge fluctuations.\n\nIn the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, a conductor is viewed as a scattering region connecting reservoirs of electrons. Here, we have a source and a drain, held at chemical potentials $\\mu_S$ and $\\mu_D$, respectively. The applied bias voltage is $V = (\\mu_S - \\mu_D)/e$. Without loss of generality, we can set $\\mu_D = \\mu_F$ (the equilibrium Fermi level) and $\\mu_S = \\mu_F + eV$. The transport of charge occurs as electrons from the source attempt to transmit through the constriction to the drain. The condition $k_B \\theta_{\\mathrm{el}} \\ll eV$ allows us to approximate the Fermi-Dirac distributions in the reservoirs as step functions, characteristic of zero temperature. Thus, the source reservoir has filled states up to energy $\\mu_S$, and the drain has filled states up to $\\mu_D$. An energy window of width $eV$ is thereby created, within which electrons can travel from source to drain.\n\nThe problem specifies a single, spin-degenerate mode. Let us first consider a single spin channel (e.g., spin-up). In a one-dimensional channel, the number of available electronic states per unit energy is $1/h$. Over a finite time interval $\\tau$, the number of states, $N_{\\text{inc, spin}}$, incident on the scatterer from the source within the energy window $[\\mu_D, \\mu_S]$ is given by the product of the density of states per unit time and the energy window width:\n$$\nN_{\\text{inc, spin}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{h} \\right) (\\mu_S - \\mu_D) \\tau = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h}\n$$\nThese incident states are occupied in the source reservoir and empty in the drain reservoir. For each of these $N_{\\text{inc, spin}}$ states, the single electron occupying it undergoes a scattering event. This event can be modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial: the electron is transmitted to the drain with probability $T$, or reflected back to the source with probability $R = 1-T$.\n\nLet $n_T$ be the number of electrons transmitted to the drain during the time $\\tau$. The statistics of $n_T$ follow a binomial distribution, $B(N_{\\text{inc, spin}}, T)$. The mean number of transmitted electrons is:\n$$\n\\langle n_T \\rangle = N_{\\text{inc, spin}} T = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} T\n$$\nThe variance of the number of transmitted electrons is a standard result for a binomial distribution:\n$$\n\\langle (n_T - \\langle n_T \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = N_{\\text{inc, spin}} T(1-T) = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} T(1-T)\n$$\nThe total charge transmitted to the drain in time $\\tau$ is $Q = e n_T$. The average transmitted charge is $\\langle Q \\rangle = e \\langle n_T \\rangle$. The fluctuation in the transmitted charge is $\\delta Q = Q - \\langle Q \\rangle = e(n_T - \\langle n_T \\rangle)$. The variance of the charge fluctuation, $\\langle \\delta Q^2 \\rangle$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\langle \\delta Q^2 \\rangle = \\langle (e(n_T - \\langle n_T \\rangle))^2 \\rangle = e^2 \\langle (n_T - \\langle n_T \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = e^2 \\left( \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} \\right) T(1-T)\n$$\nThe problem defines the zero-frequency current-noise spectral density as $S_I(0) = 2 \\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\langle \\delta Q^2 \\rangle / \\tau$. Substituting our expression for $\\langle \\delta Q^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\nS_{I, \\text{spin}}(0) = 2 \\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left[ e^2 \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} T(1-T) \\right] = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T(1-T)\n$$\nThis expression is for a single spin channel. The problem states that the mode is spin-degenerate. This means there are two independent, parallel channels for transport: one for spin-up electrons and one for spin-down electrons. We assume the transmission probability $T$ is the same for both. Since the channels are independent, the total charge fluctuation is the sum of the fluctuations from each channel, $\\delta Q_{\\text{total}} = \\delta Q_{\\uparrow} + \\delta Q_{\\downarrow}$. The total variance of the charge is the sum of the individual variances because the cross-correlation term $\\langle \\delta Q_{\\uparrow} \\delta Q_{\\downarrow} \\rangle$ is zero for independent processes:\n$$\n\\langle \\delta Q_{\\text{total}}^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\delta Q_{\\uparrow}^2 \\rangle + \\langle \\delta Q_{\\downarrow}^2 \\rangle\n$$\nConsequently, the total noise spectral density is the sum of the noise from each channel:\n$$\nS_I(0) = S_{I,\\uparrow}(0) + S_{I,\\downarrow}(0) = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T(1-T) + \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T(1-T)\n$$\n$$\nS_I(0) = \\frac{4e^3 V}{h} T(1-T)\n$$\nThis is the celebrated formula for shot noise in a single spin-degenerate channel at zero temperature. The product $T(1-T)$ captures the essence of partition noise: the noise is maximal when the partitioning of the electron stream is most uncertain and vanishes when transmission is either perfect ($T=1$) or completely blocked ($T=0$), as there is no partitioning in these deterministic limits.\n\nNext, we must find the value of $T$ that maximizes $S_I(0)$ in the interval $[0,1]$. The noise $S_I(0)$ is a function of $T$, with all other parameters ($e, V, h$) being positive constants. We seek to maximize the function $f(T) = T(1-T) = T-T^2$. To find the extremum, we compute the first derivative with respect to $T$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dS_I(0)}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left[ \\frac{4e^3 V}{h} (T-T^2) \\right] = \\frac{4e^3 V}{h} (1 - 2T)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero yields:\n$$\n\\frac{4e^3 V}{h} (1 - 2T) = 0 \\implies 1 - 2T = 0 \\implies T = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo verify that this corresponds to a maximum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2S_I(0)}{dT^2} = \\frac{d}{dT} \\left[ \\frac{4e^3 V}{h} (1 - 2T) \\right] = -\\frac{8e^3 V}{h}\n$$\nSince $e$, $V$, and $h$ are all positive constants, the second derivative is negative for all $T$. This confirms that $T = 1/2$ is a local maximum. As the function $S_I(0)$ is a downward-opening parabola with roots at $T=0$ and $T=1$, this local maximum is the global maximum on the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nThus, the shot noise is maximized when the transmission and reflection probabilities are equal, representing the point of maximum uncertainty in the electron's fate at the scatterer.\n\nThe final results are the expression for the noise spectral density $S_I(0)$ and the value of $T$ which maximizes it.",

Validation Using Extracted Givens:**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, a cornerstone of mesoscopic physics. Shot noise as a consequence of charge quantization and probabilistic scattering is a well-established phenomenon. The Y-splitter is a standard model system. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information (biasing, scattering probabilities, physical regime) to derive the noise correlators. The given constraint $R + T_1 + T_2 = 1$ ensures conservation of probability. The problem setup leads to unique, meaningful solutions for the noise expressions.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from condensed matter physics. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, standard problem in mesoscopic physics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Noise Correlators\n\nThe derivation proceeds by relating the macroscopic current noise to the microscopic fluctuations in the number of charge carriers, which are governed by the statistical partitioning of electrons at the Y-splitter.\n\n**2.1. Incident Electron Flux**\nIn the Landauer picture, the applied voltage $V$ opens an energy window of width $eV$ for transport. In the low-temperature limit ($k_BT \\ll eV$), the source reservoir (terminal $0$) at potential $V$ injects electrons into the conductor, while the drain reservoirs (terminals $1$ and $2$) at ground potential only absorb electrons. For a single spinless conducting channel, the rate at which electrons are injected from the source is given by the number of available states per unit time within the energy window $[0, eV]$. This rate is:\n$$ \\frac{dN_{inj}}{dt} = \\int_{0}^{eV} \\frac{1}{h} dE = \\frac{eV}{h} $$\nThis constitutes an incident particle current. The associated incident electrical current is $I_{inj} = e \\frac{dN_{inj}}{dt} = \\frac{e^2 V}{h}$.\n\n**2.2. Charge Partitioning Statistics**\nEach injected electron acts as an independent trial. According to the problem statement, an electron incident from the source has three possible, mutually exclusive outcomes:\n1.  Transmission to drain $1$ with probability $T_1$.\n2.  Transmission to drain $2$ with probability $T_2$.\n3.  Reflection back to the source with probability $R$.\nThe probabilities are constrained by $T_1 + T_2 + R = 1$.\n\nConsider a long time interval $\\tau$. The total number of electrons injected from the source during this interval is $N_0 = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h}$. Let $N_1$ be the number of electrons collected at drain $1$, $N_2$ the number collected at drain $2$, and $N_R$ the number reflected back to the source. These numbers are random variables, and their sum is fixed: $N_1 + N_2 + N_R = N_0$. The joint probability distribution of $(N_1, N_2, N_R)$ is a multinomial distribution with parameters $N_0$ and probabilities $(T_1, T_2, R)$.\n\n**2.3. Number Fluctuations**\nFor a multinomial distribution, the statistical moments (mean, variance, and covariance) of the counts in each category are well-known.\nThe average number of electrons arriving at drain $\\alpha \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ is:\n$$ \\langle N_\\alpha \\rangle = N_0 T_\\alpha $$\nThe variance in the number of electrons arriving at drain $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\langle (\\Delta N_\\alpha)^2 \\rangle = \\mathrm{Var}(N_\\alpha) = N_0 T_\\alpha (1 - T_\\alpha) $$\nwhere $\\Delta N_\\alpha = N_\\alpha - \\langle N_\\alpha \\rangle$.\nThe covariance between the number of electrons arriving at drains $1$ and $2$ is:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta N_1 \\Delta N_2 \\rangle = \\mathrm{Cov}(N_1, N_2) = -N_0 T_1 T_2 $$\nThe negative sign indicates that if an electron is found in drain $1$, it cannot be in drain $2$, leading to an anti-correlation in their respective counts.\n\n**2.4. From Number Fluctuations to Current Noise**\nThe zero-frequency current noise spectral density $S_{\\alpha\\beta}(0)$ is related to the long-time-limit fluctuations of the total charge transferred. The fluctuation in charge transferred to terminal $\\alpha$ over a time $\\tau$ is $\\Delta Q_\\alpha = e \\Delta N_\\alpha$. The relation between the noise spectral density and the second moment of charge fluctuations is:\n$$ S_{\\alpha\\beta}(0) = \\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{\\tau} \\langle \\Delta Q_\\alpha \\Delta Q_\\beta \\rangle = \\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\langle \\Delta N_\\alpha \\Delta N_\\beta \\rangle $$\nThis formula is consistent with the definition provided in the problem statement for shot noise, where current pulses are delta-like and uncorrelated in time.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the number (co)variances and the total number of injected electrons, $N_0 = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h}$.\n\n**Auto-correlator $S_{11}(0)$:**\n$$ S_{11}(0) = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\langle (\\Delta N_1)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\left[ N_0 T_1 (1-T_1) \\right] $$\nSubstituting $N_0$:\n$$ S_{11}(0) = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} \\right) T_1 (1-T_1) \\right] = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1 (1-T_1) $$\nUsing the constraint $1 - T_1 = T_2 + R$, this can also be written as $S_{11}(0) = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1(T_2+R)$. This form highlights that the noise at terminal $1$ arises from the partitioning of the incident electron stream into two groups: those that enter terminal $1$ and those that do not.\n\n**Auto-correlator $S_{22}(0)$:**\nBy symmetry, the derivation for $S_{22}(0)$ is identical:\n$$ S_{22}(0) = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\langle (\\Delta N_2)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\left[ N_0 T_2 (1-T_2) \\right] $$\n$$ S_{22}(0) = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_2 (1-T_2) $$\nThis can also be written as $S_{22}(0) = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_2(T_1+R)$.\n\n**Cross-correlator $S_{12}(0)$:**\n$$ S_{12}(0) = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\langle \\Delta N_1 \\Delta N_2 \\rangle = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\left[ -N_0 T_1 T_2 \\right] $$\nSubstituting $N_0$:\n$$ S_{12}(0) = \\frac{2e^2}{\\tau} \\left[ -\\left( \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} \\right) T_1 T_2 \\right] = -\\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1 T_2 $$\n\nThe units of these expressions are consistent. The factor $\\frac{e^3V}{h}$ has units of $(\\text{Coulomb})^3 (\\text{Joule}/\\text{Coulomb}) / (\\text{Joule} \\cdot \\text{second}) = \\text{C}^2/\\text{s} = (\\text{C}/\\text{s})^2 \\cdot \\text{s} = \\text{A}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}$. Since noise spectral density is measured in $\\text{A}^2/\\text{Hz}$, which is $\\text{A}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}$, the units are correct.\n\n### Step 3: Discussion of the Cross-Correlator $S_{12}(0)$\n\n**Sign of $S_{12}(0)$:**\nThe expression for the cross-correlator is $S_{12}(0) = -\\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1 T_2$. Since the elementary charge $e$, the Planck constant $h$, and the applied voltage $V$ are positive, and the transmission probabilities $T_1$ and $T_2$ are non-negative ($0 \\leq T_{1,2} \\leq 1$), the cross-correlator $S_{12}(0)$ is always negative or zero. A negative cross-correlation signifies that the current fluctuations in the two drains are anti-correlated. An instantaneous increase in current at drain $1$ is statistically associated with a simultaneous decrease in current at drain $2$. This is a direct manifestation of charge conservation and the fermionic nature of electrons: an electron partitioned into one drain cannot simultaneously enter the other. This partitioning is the source of the anti-correlation.\n\n**Conditions for $S_{12}(0)$ to vanish:**\n$S_{12}(0) = 0$ if and only if $T_1 T_2 = 0$. This occurs if $T_1 = 0$ or $T_2 = 0$. Physically, this means that if one of the drains is completely pinched off (i.e., its transmission probability is zero), no current flows to it, and thus its current cannot be correlated with any other terminal.\n\n**Conditions for $S_{12}(0)$ to be extremal:**\nThe extremum of $S_{12}(0)$ corresponds to the maximum of its magnitude, $|S_{12}(0)| = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1 T_2$. To find this extremum, we need to maximize the product $T_1 T_2$ subject to the constraints $T_1 \\ge 0$, $T_2 \\ge 0$, and $T_1+T_2 \\le 1$ (since $R = 1 - T_1 - T_2 \\ge 0$).\nLet the total transmission probability be $T_{tot} = T_1 + T_2 = 1 - R$. For a fixed reflection $R$ (and thus a fixed $T_{tot}$), we maximize $T_1(T_{tot} - T_1)$. This is a quadratic function of $T_1$ which is maximal when $T_1 = T_{tot}/2$. This implies $T_1 = T_2 = (1-R)/2$. The maximum magnitude is then $|S_{12}(0)| = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} \\left(\\frac{1-R}{2}\\right)^2$.\nTo find the absolute maximum, we can also vary $R$. The function $\\left(\\frac{1-R}{2}\\right)^2$ is maximized when $R$ is minimized. The minimum possible value for $R$ is $R=0$. In this case, $T_1 = T_2 = 1/2$. This corresponds to a perfectly symmetric, non-reflecting Y-splitter. The extremal (most negative) value of the cross-correlator is:\n$$ S_{12}(0)_{ext} = -\\frac{2e^3 V}{h} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{e^3 V}{2h} $$\n\nSummary of results:\n$S_{11}(0) = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1 (1-T_1)$\n$S_{22}(0) = \\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_2 (1-T_2)$\n$S_{12}(0) = -\\frac{2e^3 V}{h} T_1 T_2$\nThese will be formatted as a row matrix for the final answer.",

We can substitute the expressions for $I$ and $S_I$ to find an expression for $F$ for a specific realization of the transmission eigenvalues $\\{T_n\\}$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{S_I}{2eI} = \\frac{\\frac{4e^3V}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n(1-T_n)}{2e \\left(\\frac{2e^2V}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n\\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling common factors ($\\frac{4e^3V}{h}$) from the numerator and denominator yields:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n(1-T_n)}{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n}\n$$\nThis expression gives the Fano factor for a single conductor with a specific set of $N$ transmission eigenvalues. Note that this result is independent of the assumption of spin degeneracy, as the prefactors cancel.\n\nThe problem asks for the ensemble-averaged Fano factor in the self-averaging limit, as the number of channels $N \\to \\infty$. In this limit, macroscopic quantities for a single large system converge to their ensemble averages. This is a direct consequence of the law of large numbers. The numerator and denominator are sums of $N$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. We can rewrite the expression for $F$ as:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N} (T_n - T_n^2)}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n}\n$$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the sample averages converge to the expectation values (ensemble averages) over the probability distribution $P(T)$. Let us define the ensemble average of a function $g(T)$ as:\n$$\n\\langle g(T) \\rangle = \\int_0^1 g(T) P(T) \\, dT\n$$\nApplying this to the numerator and denominator, we find:\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n = \\langle T \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N} (T_n - T_n^2) = \\langle T - T^2 \\rangle = \\langle T(1-T) \\rangle\n$$\nThus, the Fano factor in the self-averaging limit is the ratio of these ensemble averages:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\langle T(1-T) \\rangle}{\\langle T \\rangle} = \\frac{\\int_0^1 T(1-T)P(T)dT}{\\int_0^1 T P(T)dT}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the ensemble-averaged Fano factor.\n\nNext, we evaluate this general expression for the specific bimodal probability density function given by:\n$$\nP(T)=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta(T-T_1)+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta(T-T_2)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function, and $T_1, T_2$ are fixed parameters in the interval $(0,1)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the denominator, $\\langle T \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\int_0^1 T \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta(T-T_1)+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta(T-T_2) \\right] dT\n$$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, $\\int g(x)\\delta(x-a)dx = g(a)$, we get:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}T_1 + \\frac{1}{2}T_2 = \\frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the numerator, $\\langle T(1-T) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle T(1-T) \\rangle = \\int_0^1 T(1-T) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta(T-T_1)+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\delta(T-T_2) \\right] dT\n$$\nAgain, using the sifting property:\n$$\n\\langle T(1-T) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}T_1(1-T_1) + \\frac{1}{2}T_2(1-T_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(T_1 - T_1^2 + T_2 - T_2^2)\n$$\n\nFinally, we find the Fano factor $F$ by taking the ratio of these two results:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\langle T(1-T) \\rangle}{\\langle T \\rangle} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(T_1 - T_1^2 + T_2 - T_2^2)}{\\frac{1}{2}(T_1 + T_2)}\n$$\n$$\nF = \\frac{T_1 - T_1^2 + T_2 - T_2^2}{T_1 + T_2}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by rearranging the terms in the numerator:\n$$\nF = \\frac{(T_1 + T_2) - (T_1^2 + T_2^2)}{T_1 + T_2}\n$$\nSeparating this into two fractions gives the final simplified form:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{T_1^2 + T_2^2}{T_1 + T_2}\n$$\nThis is the required simplified analytic expression for the Fano factor for the given bimodal distribution of transmission eigenvalues.",
