This practice challenges you to bridge the gap between microscopic physics and macroscopic models by deriving this temperature dependence from fundamental carrier scattering processes.

            "problem": "A solid-state electron subjected to a uniform electric field experiences drift acceleration and inelastic scattering by phonons. Impact ionization is the process by which a high-energy carrier creates an electron-hole pair when its kinetic energy exceeds a threshold energy. Under stationary transport in a homogeneous semiconductor, the impact ionization coefficient is the expected number of ionizing events per unit length. Consider a wide bandgap material where the dominant energy-relaxing mechanisms for high-energy electrons are acoustic phonon scattering and emission of longitudinal optical phonons. Assume that the drift velocity under high fields saturates with temperature and that the total scattering rate is the sum of independent contributions.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions that (i) the mean free path is the drift velocity divided by the total scattering rate, and (ii) the probability to traverse a required acceleration distance without an energy-relaxing collision decays exponentially with the ratio of distance to mean free path, derive the temperature dependence of the Chynoweth parameters for the impact ionization coefficient. In the Chynoweth description, the impact ionization coefficient as a function of electric field and temperature is parameterized by a prefactor and an exponential field dependence. Your derivation must begin from the above definitions and the stated microscopic model assumptions, and logically arrive at a form where both the prefactor and the field scale depend on temperature through the scattering mechanisms and the drift velocity.\n\nYou are provided a microscopically motivated model for the temperature dependence of the mean free path. Let the temperature be $T$ expressed in $\\mathrm{K}$. Let the drift velocity under high fields be $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)$, and the total scattering rate be $W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T)$. Assume\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = \\frac{v_0}{1 + c\\,T},\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T) = W_{\\mathrm{ac}}(T) + W_{\\mathrm{op}}(T),\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{ac}}(T) = C_{\\mathrm{ac}}\\, T,\n\\quad\nW_{\\mathrm{op}}(T) = C_{\\mathrm{op}}\\left[N_{\\mathrm{op}}(T) + 1\\right],\n\\quad\nN_{\\mathrm{op}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{\\mathrm{op}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) - 1},\n$$\nwhere $v_0$ is a velocity scale in $\\mathrm{cm/s}$, $c$ is a small positive constant in $\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ that captures the reduction of saturation velocity with temperature, $C_{\\mathrm{ac}}$ is an acoustic phonon scattering proportionality constant in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $C_{\\mathrm{op}}$ is an optical phonon scattering constant in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\hbar \\omega_{\\mathrm{op}}$ is the longitudinal optical phonon energy in $\\mathrm{eV}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant in $\\mathrm{eV/K}$. The mean free path is\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)}{W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T)}.\n$$\nLet the threshold energy for impact ionization be $\\varepsilon_i$ in $\\mathrm{eV}$. Under the acceleration between energy-relaxing collisions, an electron must traverse a distance equal to the energy gain per unit field to reach the threshold, and the survival probability against inelastic scattering over that distance is exponential.\n\nFrom this microscopic picture, derive functional expressions for the temperature-dependent Chynoweth parameters $A(T)$ and $B(T)$ in terms of $\\lambda(T)$ and $\\varepsilon_i$, where the impact ionization coefficient obeys a temperature-dependent exponential field law. You must start from the definitions above and show how $A(T)$ and $B(T)$ emerge from $\\lambda(T)$ and $\\varepsilon_i$ without introducing any additional phenomenological formulas.\n\nThen, using the derived form, fit the temperature-dependent Chynoweth parameters to the following experimental datasets of impact ionization coefficient $\\alpha(E,T)$ measured as a function of electric field $E$ at several temperatures. The electric field $E$ is given in $\\mathrm{MV/cm}$ and the impact ionization coefficient $\\alpha$ is given in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. All temperatures $T$ are in $\\mathrm{K}$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard problem in semiconductor physics, requiring the derivation of a simplified impact ionization model and its application to experimental data. All necessary physical models, constants, and data are provided. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Chynoweth Parameters $A(T)$ and $B(T)$\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Chynoweth parameters from a microscopic model of impact ionization. The Chynoweth law is an empirical formula for the impact ionization coefficient $\\alpha$ as a function of the electric field $E$:\n$$\n\\alpha(E,T) = A(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B(T)}{E}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A(T)$ is a temperature-dependent prefactor and $B(T)$ is a temperature-dependent critical field. Our goal is to derive expressions for $A(T)$ and $B(T)$ based on the provided physical assumptions.\n\n1.  **Energy Gain Condition**: An electron must gain a kinetic energy equal to the ionization threshold energy, $\\varepsilon_i$, to initiate an impact ionization event. In a uniform electric field $E$, the energy gained by an electron with charge $q$ over a distance $x$ is $qEx$. For an electron to reach the threshold energy, it must travel a minimum distance $x_i$ without any energy-relaxing collisions, such that $qEx_i = \\varepsilon_i$.\n    The problem provides $\\varepsilon_i$ in units of electron-Volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). It is convenient to measure energy in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and the electric field in units of $\\mathrm{V/cm}$. In this system, the elementary charge $q$ is numerically $1$. The condition becomes $E x_i = \\varepsilon_i$, which gives the required ballistic (collision-free) distance:\n    $$\n    x_i = \\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{E}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Survival Probability**: The problem states that the probability for an electron to traverse a distance $x$ without an energy-relaxing collision is given by an exponential decay law, $P(x) = \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda(T)$ is the temperature-dependent mean free path. The probability for an electron to travel the required distance $x_i$ and thus gain the energy $\\varepsilon_i$ is called the survival probability, $P_{\\text{surv}}$:\n    $$\n    P_{\\text{surv}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_i}{\\lambda(T)}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{E \\lambda(T)}\\right)\n    $$\n    This is the probability that an electron becomes a \"lucky\" electron, capable of causing ionization.\n\n3.  **Ionization Rate**: The impact ionization coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined as the expected number of ionizing events per unit length. This can be interpreted as the reciprocal of the average distance an electron travels between ionization events, $\\langle x_{\\text{ion}} \\rangle$.\n    $$\n    \\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\langle x_{\\text{ion}} \\rangle}\n    $$\n    We can model the ionization process as a sequence of independent trials. Each trial corresponds to an electron traveling one mean free path, $\\lambda(T)$. The probability of success in any given trial (i.e., the electron becoming \"lucky\") is $P_{\\text{surv}}$. The process of waiting for the first success follows a geometric distribution. The expected number of trials required to achieve the first success is $1/P_{\\text{surv}}$.\n    The average distance traveled for one ionization event is the distance per trial, $\\lambda(T)$, multiplied by the expected number of trials:\n    $$\n    \\langle x_{\\text{ion}} \\rangle = \\lambda(T) \\times \\frac{1}{P_{\\text{surv}}} = \\lambda(T) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{E \\lambda(T)}\\right)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Identification of Chynoweth Parameters**: Substituting this into the expression for $\\alpha$, we get:\n    $$\n    \\alpha(E,T) = \\frac{1}{\\langle x_{\\text{ion}} \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(T)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{E \\lambda(T)}\\right)\n    $$\n    By comparing this derived form with the Chynoweth law, $\\alpha(E,T) = A(T) \\exp(-B(T)/E)$, we can identify the parameters $A(T)$ and $B(T)$.\n\n    The prefactor $A(T)$ is:\n    $$\n    A(T) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(T)}\n    $$\n    The units are correct: if $\\lambda$ is in $\\mathrm{cm}$, $A$ is in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, matching the units of $\\alpha$.\n\n    The exponential term gives us $B(T)$. The electric field $E$ is given in $\\mathrm{MV/cm}$. We must be careful with units. Let $E_{MV}$ be the field in $\\mathrm{MV/cm}$ and $E_V$ be the field in $\\mathrm{V/cm}$. Then $E_V = E_{MV} \\times 10^6$. Our derivation for the exponent used $E_V$. The exponent is $-\\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{E_V \\lambda(T)} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{(E_{MV} \\times 10^6) \\lambda(T)}$.\n    We are matching this to the form $-\\frac{B_{MV}}{E_{MV}}$, where $B_{MV}$ is the critical field in units of $\\mathrm{MV/cm}$.\n    Thus, by comparison:\n    $$\n    B(T) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{10^6 \\lambda(T)}\n    $$\n    The units are correct: if $\\varepsilon_i$ is in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\lambda$ in $\\mathrm{cm}$, the quantity $\\varepsilon_i/\\lambda$ has units of $\\mathrm{V/cm}$. Dividing by $10^6$ correctly converts this to $\\mathrm{MV/cm}$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Parameters\n\n**Fitted Parameters $\\hat{A}(T)$ and $\\hat{B}(T)$**\n\nTo find the best-fit parameters from the experimental data, we linearize the Chynoweth equation:\n$$\n\\ln(\\alpha) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{B}{E}\n$$\nThis is a linear relation of the form $y = m x + c$, where $y = \\ln(\\alpha)$, $x = 1/E$, the slope is $m = -B$, and the y-intercept is $c = \\ln(A)$. For each temperature dataset, we perform a linear least-squares regression on the transformed data points $(1/E_j, \\ln(\\alpha_j))$.\nThe fitted parameters are then:\n$$\n\\hat{B}(T) = -\\text{slope}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{A}(T) = \\exp(\\text{intercept})\n$$\n\n**Model-Predicted Parameters $A_{\\mathrm{model}}(T)$ and $B_{\\mathrm{model}}(T)$**\n\nThese parameters are computed by first calculating the mean free path $\\lambda(T)$ using the provided microscopic model and constants for each temperature $T \\in \\{250\\,\\mathrm{K}, 300\\,\\mathrm{K}, 400\\,\\mathrm{K}\\}$.\n\nThe calculation steps for a given $T$ are:\n1.  Calculate the Bose-Einstein distribution for optical phonons:\n    $N_{\\mathrm{op}}(T) = \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{\\mathrm{op}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) - 1\\right]^{-1}$\n2.  Calculate the total scattering rate $W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T)$:\n    $W_{\\mathrm{op}}(T) = C_{\\mathrm{op}}\\left[N_{\\mathrm{op}}(T) + 1\\right]$\n    $W_{\\mathrm{ac}}(T) = C_{\\mathrm{ac}}\\, T$\n    $W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T) = W_{\\mathrm{ac}}(T) + W_{\\mathrm{op}}(T)$\n3.  Calculate the saturated drift velocity $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)$:\n    $v_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = \\frac{v_0}{1 + c\\,T}$\n4.  Calculate the mean free path $\\lambda(T)$:\n    $\\lambda(T) = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)}{W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(T)}$\n5.  Calculate the model parameters using the expressions derived in Part 1:\n    $A_{\\mathrm{model}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(T)}$\n    $B_{\\mathrm{model}}(T) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{10^6 \\lambda(T)}$\n\nThe following program implements these calculations for the three given datasets, performs the fitting, and reports the results in the specified format. All final values are rounded to three significant figures.",

Consider a one-dimensional, one-sided abrupt $p^{+}$–$n^{-}$ diode model in which the donor concentration $N_{D}$ is uniform across the drift thickness $t$, and adopt the following fundamental laws and well-tested relationships: (i) Poisson’s equation for the electric field in a uniformly doped region, $\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge and $\\varepsilon_{s}$ is the semiconductor permittivity; (ii) the electrostatic relation $V = \\int_{0}^{L} E(x)\\,dx$ between the electric field profile $E(x)$ and the applied reverse bias $V$ over the depleted length $L$; and (iii) a Chynoweth-type electron impact ionization coefficient for GaN, $\\alpha(E) = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{B}{E}\\right)$, where $A$ and $B$ are material parameters.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a detailed, physically consistent model of avalanche breakdown in a GaN p-n diode, including standard physics equations (Poisson's equation, Chynoweth's law) and a plausible model for field plate edge termination. All necessary parameters, constants, and test cases are provided. The task is to implement this model numerically to find the breakdown voltage, which is a standard procedure in semiconductor device engineering. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by determining the breakdown voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BR}}$ for a one-dimensional GaN $p^+$-$n^-$ diode. The breakdown voltage is defined as the minimum reverse bias voltage $V$ that satisfies either of two conditions:\n1.  The effective peak electric field $E_{0,\\mathrm{eff}}$ at the junction reaches the critical field $E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Let this voltage be $V_{\\mathrm{BR,crit}}$.\n2.  The ionization integral across the depletion region equals unity. Let this voltage be $V_{\\mathrm{BR,int}}$.\nThe final breakdown voltage is thus $V_{\\mathrm{BR}} = \\min(V_{\\mathrm{BR,crit}}, V_{\\mathrm{BR,int}})$.\n\nThe model is divided into two operational regimes based on the applied reverse voltage $V$ relative to the full-depletion voltage $V_{\\mathrm{fd}}$, defined as:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{fd}} = \\frac{q N_{D} t^{2}}{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $N_D$ is the donor concentration, $t$ is the drift region thickness, and $\\varepsilon_s$ is the semiconductor permittivity.\n\nFor a given reverse voltage $V$, we first determine the depletion width $W$, the depleted length $L$ over which the field is non-zero, and the electric field profile $E(x)$.\n\n**1. Partial Depletion Regime ($V \\le V_{\\mathrm{fd}}$)**\nIn this regime, the depletion region extends only partially into the drift region.\n- Depletion width: $W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} V}{q N_{D}}}$\n- Depleted length: $L = W$\n- The electric field is triangular, peaking at the junction ($x=0$) and decaying linearly to zero at the edge of the depletion region ($x=W$):\n$$\nE(x) = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}(W - x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [0, W]\n$$\n- The peak electric field at $x=0$ is $E_0 = E(0) = \\frac{q N_D W}{\\varepsilon_s} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 q N_D V}{\\varepsilon_s}}$.\n\n**2. Full Depletion Regime ($V  V_{\\mathrm{fd}}$)**\nIn this regime, the entire drift region is depleted, and a further increase in voltage raises the electric field across the entire region.\n- Depletion width: $W = t$\n- Depleted length: $L = t$\n- The electric field is trapezoidal, with a non-zero value $E_t$ at the far contact ($x=t$):\n$$\nE(x) = E_{t} + \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}(t - x), \\quad \\text{where } E_{t} = \\frac{V}{t} - \\frac{q N_{D} t}{2 \\varepsilon_{s}} \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [0, t]\n$$\n- The peak electric field at $x=0$ is $E_0 = E(0) = \\frac{V}{t} + \\frac{q N_D t}{2 \\varepsilon_s}$.\n\n**Edge Termination and Field Suppression**\nA field plate structure suppresses the peak electric field. This is modeled by an effective field profile $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x) = \\gamma E(x)$, where $\\gamma$ is a voltage-dependent suppression factor:\n$$\n\\gamma(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + C_{j}(V)/C_{\\mathrm{fp,eff}}(V)}\n$$\nThis factor depends on the ratio of the junction capacitance per unit area, $C_j = \\varepsilon_s/W(V)$, to the effective field plate capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\mathrm{fp,eff}}(V)$. The latter is given by $C_{\\mathrm{fp,eff}} = \\kappa \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}/t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, with $\\kappa = \\min(1, L_{\\mathrm{fp}}/W(V))$. If there is no field plate ($L_{\\mathrm{fp}}=0$), then $C_{\\mathrm{fp,eff}}=0$ and $\\gamma=1$. The effective peak field is $E_{0,\\mathrm{eff}}(V) = \\gamma(V) E_0(V)$.\n\n**Numerical Solution Strategy**\nBoth breakdown conditions lead to non-linear equations in $V$ that must be solved numerically. We use a root-finding algorithm (`scipy.optimize.brentq`) for this purpose, as the relevant functions are monotonic with respect to voltage.\n\n**a) Critical Field Breakdown Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{BR,crit}}$)**\nWe solve for the voltage $V$ that satisfies $E_{0,\\mathrm{eff}}(V) = E_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. This is equivalent to finding the root of the residual function:\n$$\nf_1(V) = \\gamma(V) E_0(V) - E_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0\n$$\n\n**b) Ionization Integral Breakdown Voltage ($V_{\\mathrm{BR,int}}$)**\nThe avalanche condition is met when the ionization integral equals one. The electron ionization coefficient for GaN is given by the Chynoweth law, $\\alpha(E) = A e^{-B/E}$. We solve for the voltage $V$ that satisfies:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L(V)} \\alpha\\left(\\gamma(V) E(x, V)\\right) dx = 1\n$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the root of the residual function:\n$$\nf_2(V) = \\left( \\int_{0}^{L(V)} A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{\\gamma(V) E(x, V)}\\right) dx \\right) - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe definite integral is computed numerically at each step of the root-finding process using `scipy.integrate.quad`.\n\nFor each test case, we compute $V_{\\mathrm{BR,crit}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{BR,int}}$ by finding the roots of $f_1(V)$ and $f_2(V)$ within a plausible voltage range. The smaller of the two resulting voltages is the device's breakdown voltage $V_{\\mathrm{BR}}$, which is then rounded to one decimal place as required.",

This simplification breaks down in modern, scaled devices where the field changes rapidly over short distances.

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional carrier transport model under a uniform electric field in which impact ionization is described by a renewal process of ionization events. You are asked to incorporate nonlocal effects by tracking the distance since the last ionization event and to compile a dead-space distribution that parameterizes a nonlocal impact ionization coefficient. The goal is to derive and implement a nonlocal ionization rate model that accounts for the distance a carrier must travel to accumulate sufficient energy to cause another ionization event.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n\n- A carrier of charge $q$ gains potential energy per unit distance equal to $q E$, where $E$ is the electric field magnitude. Express energy in electron volts and electric field in volt per meter, using the standard correspondence that an electron gaining $1$ electron volt traverses a potential drop of $1$ volt. Under a constant electric field $E$, the minimal travel distance required to gain an ionization threshold energy $\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}$ (in electron volts) is the dead space $d_{0}$ given by $d_{0} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{th}} / E$ in meters.\n- For the local description of impact ionization in a uniform field, use a widely accepted empirical Townsend-like form of the local impact ionization coefficient $\\alpha_{0}(E)$ that depends on $E$ as $\\alpha_{0}(E) = A \\exp(-B/E)$, where $A$ has units of inverse meter and $B$ has units of volt per meter.\n\nTask:\n\n1. Starting from the general definition of the hazard function $h(s)$ (ionization rate per unit length conditioned on the ionization not yet occurring after a distance $s$), construct a piecewise constant hazard model appropriate for a dead-space process: $h(s) = 0$ for $s  d_{0}$ and $h(s) = \\alpha_{0}(E)$ for $s \\ge d_{0}$. Using this hazard, derive the associated pathlength Probability Density Function (PDF) $p_{S}(s)$ for the distance $S$ to the next ionization event and then derive the mean pathlength $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ in terms of $d_{0}$ and $\\alpha_{0}(E)$.\n2.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model for nonlocal impact ionization in semiconductors, which is a key topic in advanced device physics. The provided parameters are physically plausible, and the tasks are clearly defined, leading to a unique, meaningful solution. We will proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we derive the probability density function for the ionization pathlength and its mean value. Second, we use this result to derive the expression for the nonlocal ionization coefficient. Third, we outline the computational procedure to be implemented.\n\n**Part 1: Pathlength Probability Density Function (PDF) and Mean Pathlength**\n\nThe distance $S$ to the next ionization event is modeled as a continuous random variable. Its statistical properties can be derived from the hazard function $h(s)$, which represents the instantaneous rate of ionization at a distance $s$, given that ionization has not yet occurred. The relationship between the PDF $p_S(s)$, the survival function $R(s) = P(Ss)$, and the hazard function $h(s)$ is given by:\n$$\nh(s) = \\frac{p_S(s)}{R(s)}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the survival function as:\n$$\nR(s) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^s h(u) \\, du\\right)\n$$\nAnd consequently, the PDF is:\n$$\np_S(s) = h(s)R(s) = h(s) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^s h(u) \\, du\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines a piecewise constant hazard function that incorporates a \"dead space\" $d_0$. The dead space is the minimum distance a carrier must travel under an electric field $E$ to gain the threshold energy $\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}$ required for impact ionization. This is given by $d_0 = \\varepsilon_{\\text{th}} / E$. Before this distance, the ionization probability is zero. After this distance, the carrier is assumed to ionize with a constant local rate $\\alpha_0(E)$. The hazard function is thus:\n$$\nh(s) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{for } s  d_0 \\\\ \\alpha_0(E)  \\text{for } s \\ge d_0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_0(E) = A \\exp(-B/E)$ is the local Townsend-like ionization coefficient.\n\nFirst, we compute the integrated hazard, $H(s) = \\int_0^s h(u) \\, du$.\nFor $s  d_0$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\int_0^s 0 \\, du = 0\n$$\nFor $s \\ge d_0$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\int_0^{d_0} 0 \\, du + \\int_{d_0}^s \\alpha_0(E) \\, du = 0 + \\alpha_0(E) [u]_{d_0}^s = \\alpha_0(E)(s - d_0)\n$$\nNow we can determine the PDF $p_S(s)$:\nFor $s  d_0$, $h(s)=0$, so $p_S(s)=0$. This confirms that ionization is impossible before traversing the dead space.\nFor $s \\ge d_0$, $h(s)=\\alpha_0(E)$, so:\n$$\np_S(s) = \\alpha_0(E) \\exp(-\\alpha_0(E)(s - d_0))\n$$\nIn summary, the PDF for the ionization pathlength $S$ is that of a shifted exponential distribution:\n$$\np_S(s) = \\begin{cases} 0  \\text{for } s  d_0 \\\\ \\alpha_0(E) \\exp(-\\alpha_0(E)(s - d_0))  \\text{for } s \\ge d_0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nNext, we derive the mean pathlength $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ using the definition of the expected value:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s \\, p_S(s) \\, ds = \\int_{d_0}^{\\infty} s \\, \\alpha_0(E) \\exp(-\\alpha_0(E)(s - d_0)) \\, ds\n$$\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution $x = s - d_0$, which implies $s = x + d_0$ and $ds = dx$. The lower limit of integration becomes $d_0 - d_0 = 0$. For brevity, let $\\alpha_0 = \\alpha_0(E)$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (x + d_0) \\, \\alpha_0 e^{-\\alpha_0 x} \\, dx\n$$\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\, \\alpha_0 e^{-\\alpha_0 x} \\, dx + d_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\alpha_0 e^{-\\alpha_0 x} \\, dx\n$$\nThe first integral is the expected value of a standard exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\alpha_0$, which is equal to $1/\\alpha_0$. The second integral is $d_0$ times the integral of a PDF over its entire support, which is $1$.\nTherefore, the mean pathlength is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_0(E)} + d_0\n$$\nThis result is intuitively satisfying: the average distance to ionization is the sum of the deterministic dead space distance and the average distance traveled after the carrier is able to ionize.\n\n**Part 2: Nonlocal Effective Impact Ionization Coefficient**\n\nRenewal theory states that for a process where events (ionizations) occur sequentially and the time (or distance) between them is an independent and identically distributed random variable, the long-run average rate of events is the reciprocal of the mean time (or distance) between them.\nThe problem defines the nonlocal effective impact ionization coefficient, $\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E)$, as this long-run average number of ionizations per unit length. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb{E}[S]}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[S]$ derived in Part 1:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E) = \\frac{1}{d_0 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha_0(E)}}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically rearranged to:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E) = \\frac{\\alpha_0(E)}{1 + d_0 \\, \\alpha_0(E)}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the nonlocal ionization coefficient. It correctly shows that $\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E)$ is always less than the local coefficient $\\alpha_0(E)$ due to the dead space effect. In the limit where the dead space $d_0 \\to 0$, we recover the local model, as $\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E) \\to \\alpha_0(E)$.\n\n**Part 3: Computational Implementation**\n\nThe final task is to implement a program to calculate $\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E)$ for several sets of parameters. The algorithm for each test case is as follows:\nGiven a set of parameters $\\{E, \\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}, A, B\\}$:\n1.  Calculate the local ionization coefficient $\\alpha_0(E)$ using its definition:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_0(E) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B}{E}\\right)\n    $$\n2.  Calculate the dead space $d_0$:\n    $$\n    d_0 = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}}{E}\n    $$\n3.  Calculate the nonlocal effective ionization coefficient $\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E)$ using the derived formula:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E) = \\frac{\\alpha_0(E)}{1 + d_0 \\, \\alpha_0(E)}\n    $$\nThe program will iterate through the provided test cases, perform these calculations for each, and store the resulting values of $\\alpha_{\\text{nl}}(E)$. The final output will be a single line containing these results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.",
