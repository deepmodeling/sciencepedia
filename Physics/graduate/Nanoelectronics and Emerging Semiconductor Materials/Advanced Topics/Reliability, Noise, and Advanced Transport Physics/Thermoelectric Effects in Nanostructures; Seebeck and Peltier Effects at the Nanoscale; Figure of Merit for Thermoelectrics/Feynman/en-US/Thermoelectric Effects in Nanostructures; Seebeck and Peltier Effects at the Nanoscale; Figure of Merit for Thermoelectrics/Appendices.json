            "problem": "A metal–semiconductor nanoscale junction carries a steady direct current $I$ under near-isothermal conditions at the junction.

            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part analysis of the heat generated at a metal-semiconductor nanoscale junction. First, we must derive the fundamental relationships governing thermoelectric effects from the principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics. Second, we apply these relationships to calculate the Peltier heat rate for the given junction parameters.\n\n### Part 1: Theoretical Framework\n\nWe begin with the framework of coupled transport phenomena, which describes the simultaneous flow of charge and heat. In a continuous medium, the electric current density, $J_e$, and the entropy current density, $J_s$, are linearly related to the thermodynamic forces. A proper choice of conjugate fluxes and forces that ensures the Onsager reciprocal relations hold is $(J_e, J_s)$ and the forces $X_e = -\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi$ and $X_s = -\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T$, where $\\phi$ is the electric potential and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The phenomenological equations are:\n$$J_e = L_{ee} X_e + L_{es} X_s = L_{ee} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi\\right) + L_{es} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T\\right)$$\n$$J_s = L_{se} X_e + L_{ss} X_s = L_{se} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi\\right) + L_{ss} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T\\right)$$\nThe Onsager reciprocal relation, a consequence of microreversibility, states that the matrix of kinetic coefficients $L_{ij}$ is symmetric, so $L_{es} = L_{se}$.\n\nWe can now define the key thermoelectric coefficients in terms of these kinetic coefficients.\n\n1.  **Seebeck Coefficient ($S$)**: The Seebeck effect describes the voltage generated across a material in the presence of a temperature gradient under the condition of zero electric current ($J_e = 0$).\n    Setting $J_e = 0$ in the first equation:\n    $$0 = L_{ee} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi\\right) + L_{es} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T\\right)$$\n    $$L_{ee}\\nabla\\phi = -L_{es}(-\\nabla T) = L_{es}\\nabla T$$\n    The Seebeck coefficient is defined as the resulting open-circuit voltage gradient per unit temperature gradient, $S = \\frac{\\nabla\\phi}{\\nabla T}$.\n    $$S = \\frac{L_{es}}{L_{ee}}$$\n\n2.  **Peltier Coefficient ($\\Pi$)**: The Peltier effect describes the heat carried by an electric current under isothermal conditions ($\\nabla T = 0$). The heat current density is $J_Q = T J_s$.\n    Setting $\\nabla T = 0$ in the transport equations:\n    $$J_e = L_{ee} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi\\right)$$\n    $$J_s = L_{se} \\left(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi\\right)$$\n    Substituting the expression for $(-\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla\\phi)$ from the $J_e$ equation into the $J_s$ equation:\n    $$J_s = L_{se} \\left(\\frac{J_e}{L_{ee}}\\right) = \\frac{L_{se}}{L_{ee}} J_e$$\n    The heat current density is thus $J_Q = T J_s = T \\frac{L_{se}}{L_{ee}} J_e$. The Peltier coefficient $\\Pi$ is defined as the ratio of the heat current density to the electric current density under isothermal conditions, $\\Pi = \\frac{J_Q}{J_e}$.\n    $$\\Pi = T \\frac{L_{se}}{L_{ee}}$$\n\nUsing the Onsager relation $L_{es} = L_{se}$, we can connect the Seebeck and Peltier coefficients.\n$$\\Pi = T \\frac{L_{se}}{L_{ee}} = T \\frac{L_{es}}{L_{ee}} = T S$$\nThis fundamental result, $\\Pi = ST$, is the second Kelvin (or Thomson) relation.\n\n### Part 2: Energy Conservation and Heat Decomposition at the Junction\n\nNow, we analyze the heat generation within the control volume enclosing the junction. We apply the principle of energy conservation under steady-state conditions. The total heat rate released into the control volume, $\\dot{Q}$, is the net rate of energy flowing into it. The energy is carried by the electric current $I$.\n\nThe total energy current $I_E$ is the sum of the electric potential energy current $I \\phi$ and the heat current $I_Q$. Thus, $I_E = I_Q + I \\phi$. The heat current itself is related to the Peltier coefficient of the material, $I_Q = \\Pi I$.\n\nThe problem states that a positive current $I$ corresponds to electron flow from the metal (m) into the semiconductor (s). This means the conventional current flows from the semiconductor to the metal ($s \\to m$).\n\nEnergy enters the control volume from the semiconductor side at a rate $I_{E,s} = I_{Q,s} + I \\phi_s = \\Pi_s I + I \\phi_s$.\nEnergy leaves the control volume into the metal side at a rate $I_{E,m} = I_{Q,m} + I \\phi_m = \\Pi_m I + I \\phi_m$.\n\nThe net heat rate released into the control volume is the difference between the energy inflow and outflow:\n$$\\dot{Q} = I_{E,s} - I_{E,m} = (\\Pi_s I + I \\phi_s) - (\\Pi_m I + I \\phi_m)$$\n$$\\dot{Q} = (\\Pi_s - \\Pi_m)I + (\\phi_s - \\phi_m)I$$\nThe term $(\\phi_s - \\phi_m)$ represents the voltage drop across the junction due to its ohmic contact resistance $R$. According to Ohm's law, $\\phi_s - \\phi_m = IR$. The term $(\\Pi_s - \\Pi_m)$ is the relative Peltier coefficient of the junction, which we denote as $\\Pi_{sm}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\dot{Q}$:\n$$\\dot{Q} = \\Pi_{sm}I + (IR)I = \\Pi_{sm}I + I^2 R$$\nThis equation shows that the total interfacial heat rate $\\dot{Q}$ is decomposed into two distinct contributions:\n1.  A thermoelectric Peltier contribution, $\\dot{Q}_P = \\Pi_{sm}I$. This term is reversible with respect to the current direction.\n2.  A resistive Joule contribution, $\\dot{Q}_J = I^2 R$. This term is irreversible and always positive.\n\nThe problem asks for the Peltier heat rate, $\\dot{Q}_P$. Using the Kelvin relation $\\Pi_{sm} = S_{sm}T$, where $S_{sm} = S_s - S_m$ is the Seebeck coefficient of the semiconductor relative to the metal, we can express the Peltier heat rate entirely in terms of the Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, and current:\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = S_{sm} T I$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Current: $I = 83.5~\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 83.5 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{A}$\n-   Relative Seebeck coefficient: $S = S_{sm} = +237~\\mu\\mathrm{V}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} = 237 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n-   Absolute temperature: $T = 307~\\mathrm{K}$\n-   Contact resistance: $R = 510~\\Omega$ (This value is needed for the Joule heat term, not the Peltier heat rate.)\n\nWe calculate the Peltier heat rate $\\dot{Q}_P$:\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = S T I = (237 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (307~\\mathrm{K}) \\times (83.5 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{A})$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = (237 \\times 307 \\times 83.5) \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{W}$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = 6075376.5 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{W}$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = 6.0753765 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in microwatts ($\\mu\\mathrm{W}$), where $1~\\mu\\mathrm{W} = 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{W}$.\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = 6.0753765~\\mu\\mathrm{W}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\dot{Q}_P = 6.075~\\mu\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe positive sign indicates that, for the given current direction and material properties, the Peltier effect contributes to heat being released at the junction.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for an expression for the Seebeck coefficient $S$ of a one-dimensional ballistic nanowire with a rectangular tunnel barrier. The derivation will proceed in five steps: 1) establishing the formal expression for $S$ in the linear response regime using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism; 2) applying the low-temperature Sommerfeld expansion to obtain the Mott relation; 3) calculating the energy-dependent transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation and its logarithmic derivative; 4) using the given fabrication constraint to eliminate unknown device parameters; and 5) combining these results to find the final expression for $S$.\n\nFirst, we begin with the Landauer-Büttiker formula for the electrical current $I$ through a single spin-degenerate conducting channel. The current is driven by differences in the electrochemical potential and temperature of the source (S) and drain (D) reservoirs.\n$$ I = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{T}(E) [f_S(E) - f_D(E)] dE $$\nHere, $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ is the transmission probability, $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $f_{S,D}(E) = (1 + \\exp((E - \\mu_{S,D})/(k_B T_{S,D})))^{-1}$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions in the source and drain.\nIn the linear-response regime, we consider an infinitesimal voltage bias $\\delta V = V_S - V_D$ and temperature bias $\\delta T = T_S - T_D$. A convenient set of variables is a common mode chemical potential $\\mu$ and temperature $T$, with differential biases applied such that $\\mu_S = \\mu + e\\delta V/2$, $\\mu_D = \\mu-e\\delta V/2$. For electron charge $q=-e$, the electrochemical potential is $\\mu_{\\text{ec}} = \\mu - eV$, so $\\mu_{S,D} = \\mu - e V_{S,D}$. The difference is $\\mu_S-\\mu_D = -e(V_S-V_D) = -e\\delta V$. Using the Taylor expansion of the Fermi function difference:\n$$ f_S(E) - f_D(E) \\approx \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right) \\left[ (\\mu_S - \\mu_D) + \\frac{E-\\mu}{T}(T_S - T_D) \\right] $$\nThe charge current $I$ (for charge $q=-e$) is:\n$$ I = \\frac{2(-e)}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right) \\left[ (-e\\delta V) + \\frac{E-\\mu}{T}(\\delta T) \\right] dE $$\n$$ I = \\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E)(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E})dE\\right)\\delta V + \\left(\\frac{2(-e)}{hT} \\int (E-\\mu)\\mathcal{T}(E)(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E})dE\\right)\\delta T $$\nThe Seebeck coefficient $S$ is defined as $S = \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta T}$ under the open-circuit condition ($I=0$). Setting $I=0$ gives:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta T} = -\\frac{\\frac{2(-e)}{hT} \\int (E-\\mu)\\mathcal{T}(E)(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E})dE}{\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\int \\mathcal{T}(E)(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E})dE} = -\\frac{1}{(-e)T}\\frac{\\int (E-\\mu)\\mathcal{T}(E)(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E})dE}{\\int \\mathcal{T}(E)(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E})dE} $$\nLet's define the transport integrals $L_n = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (E-\\mu)^n \\mathcal{T}(E) (-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}) dE$. Then $S = -\\frac{1}{qT} \\frac{L_1}{L_0} = -\\frac{1}{(-e)T} \\frac{L_1}{L_0} = \\frac{1}{eT} \\frac{L_1}{L_0}$.\n\nSecond, in the low-temperature limit ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta$), the term $-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}$ is a sharply peaked function around $E=\\mu$. This allows the use of the Sommerfeld expansion to evaluate the integrals $L_n$. To leading order,\n$$ L_0 = \\int \\mathcal{T}(E) (-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}) dE \\approx \\mathcal{T}(\\mu) $$\n$$ L_1 = \\int (E-\\mu) \\mathcal{T}(E) (-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}) dE \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2(k_B T)^2}{3} \\left. \\frac{d\\mathcal{T}(E)}{dE} \\right|_{E=\\mu} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $S$:\n$$ S \\approx \\frac{1}{eT} \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^2(k_B T)^2}{3} \\mathcal{T}'(\\mu)}{\\mathcal{T}(\\mu)} = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3e} \\frac{\\mathcal{T}'(\\mu)}{\\mathcal{T}(\\mu)} = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3e} \\left. \\frac{d\\ln(\\mathcal{T}(E))}{dE} \\right|_{E=\\mu} $$\nThis is the well-known Mott formula. A common convention for electrons ($q=-e$) is $S = - \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3|e|} \\frac{\\sigma'}{\\sigma}$. Let's re-verify the sign. For electrons, $S=V/\\delta T$. If hot electrons are more transmissive, they flow to the cold side, making it more negative. So $V_{cold}  V_{hot}$, which means $\\delta V$ has the opposite sign to $\\delta T$. So $S0$. Our formula gives $S \\propto \\mathcal{T}'(\\mu)$. For tunneling, higher energy means higher transmission, so $\\mathcal{T}'(\\mu) > 0$, giving $S>0$. There is a sign error in my linear response derivation. Let's use the standard definition $S = -\\frac{\\delta V}{\\delta T}$.\nThen $S = -\\frac{G_T}{G}$, where $I = G \\delta V + G_T \\delta T$. From above, $G = \\frac{2e^2}{h}L_0$ and $G_T = -\\frac{2e}{hT}L_1$. So $S = -(\\frac{-2e/hT}{2e^2/h}) \\frac{L_1}{L_0} = \\frac{1}{eT}\\frac{L_1}{L_0}$. The derivation was right, but my physical intuition was off. Let's trust the math: $S = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3e} \\frac{d\\ln \\mathcal{T}}{dE}$.\n\nThird, we evaluate the logarithmic derivative of the transmission probability. The WKB approximation for transmission through a rectangular barrier of height $U_0$ and width $d$ for an electron of energy $E  U_0$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T}(E) = \\exp\\left(-2d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*(U_0-E)}}{\\hbar}\\right) $$\nwhere $m^*$ is the effective mass and $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$ is the reduced Planck constant. The natural logarithm is:\n$$ \\ln(\\mathcal{T}(E)) = -2d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar} (U_0-E)^{1/2} $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $E$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ln(\\mathcal{T}(E))}{dE} = -2d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(U_0-E)^{-1/2}(-1)\\right) = d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar} (U_0-E)^{-1/2} $$\nEvaluating this derivative at the chemical potential $E=\\mu$ and using the definition $\\Delta = U_0 - \\mu$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d\\ln(\\mathcal{T}(E))}{dE} \\right|_{E=\\mu} = d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{U_0-\\mu}} = d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar\\sqrt{\\Delta}} $$\n\nFourth, we use the fabrication constraint $\\mathcal{T}(\\mu) = \\tau$, where $0  \\tau \\ll 1$. From the WKB expression:\n$$ \\tau = \\exp\\left(-2d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*(U_0-\\mu)}}{\\hbar}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-2d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*\\Delta}}{\\hbar}\\right) $$\nTaking the logarithm, we get an expression for the unknown parameters $d$ and $m^*$:\n$$ \\ln(\\tau) = -2d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*\\Delta}}{\\hbar} = -2 \\left(d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar}\\right) \\sqrt{\\Delta} $$\nSolving for the group of unknown parameters:\n$$ d\\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*}}{\\hbar} = -\\frac{\\ln(\\tau)}{2\\sqrt{\\Delta}} $$\nSubstitute this back into the expression for the logarithmic derivative:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d\\ln(\\mathcal{T}(E))}{dE} \\right|_{E=\\mu} = \\left(-\\frac{\\ln(\\tau)}{2\\sqrt{\\Delta}}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Delta}} = -\\frac{\\ln(\\tau)}{2\\Delta} $$\n\nFifth, we substitute this result back into the Mott formula for the Seebeck coefficient. It seems my sign was wrong after all, and the standard electron formula $S = -(\\pi^2 k_B^2 T / 3e) (\\sigma'/\\sigma)$ is correct. Let's adopt that.\n$$ S = -\\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3e} \\left( \\left. \\frac{d\\ln(\\mathcal{T}(E))}{dE} \\right|_{E=\\mu} \\right) $$\n$$ S = -\\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}{3e} \\left(-\\frac{\\ln(\\tau)}{2\\Delta}\\right) $$\n$$ S = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 T \\ln(\\tau)}{6e\\Delta} $$\nSince $\\tau \\ll 1$, $\\ln(\\tau)$ is negative. All other quantities ($k_B$, $T$, $e$, $\\Delta$) are positive. Therefore, the Seebeck coefficient $S$ is negative, which is the correct sign for electron transport dominated by tunneling through a barrier above the chemical potential.",

For this optimal form, the transport integrals become:\n$$L_0 = A \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right)_{E=E^\\star}$$\n$$L_1 = A (E^\\star-\\mu) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right)_{E=E^\\star}$$\nThe functional $Q$ then becomes a simple function of $E^\\star$:\n$$\nQ(E^\\star) = \\frac{\\left[ A(E^\\star-\\mu) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right)_{E=E^\\star} \\right]^2}{A \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right)_{E=E^\\star}} = A (E^\\star-\\mu)^2 \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right)_{E=E^\\star}\n$$\nThe functional optimization problem is thus reduced to a simple single-variable optimization: finding the energy $E^\\star$ that maximizes this function.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Stationarity Condition**\n\nWe must find the maximum of $F(E^\\star) = (E^\\star-\\mu)^2 \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E}\\right)_{E=E^\\star}$. Let's introduce the dimensionless variable $y = (E-\\mu)/(k_B T)$. The Fermi window function becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial E} = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_B T}\\right) + 1\\right]^2} = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2} = \\frac{1}{4 k_B T} \\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the function to be maximized, we get a function of $y$:\n$$\n\\tilde{F}(y) = (y k_B T)^2 \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2} \\propto y^2 \\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2}\n$$\nTo maximize $\\tilde{F}(y)$, we only need to maximize the dimensionless function $g(y) = y^2 \\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2}$. We find the stationary points by setting its derivative with respect to $y$ to zero, for $y \\ne 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dy} = 2y \\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2} + y^2 \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nDividing by $y \\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2}$ (since we are looking for non-trivial solutions $y \\ne 0$):\n$$\n2 + y \\frac{(e^y+1)^2}{e^y} \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{e^y}{(e^y+1)^2}\\right) = \\frac{e^y(e^y+1)^2 - e^y \\cdot 2(e^y+1)e^y}{(e^y+1)^4} = \\frac{e^y(e^y+1) - 2e^{2y}}{(e^y+1)^3} = \\frac{e^y(1-e^y)}{(e^y+1)^3}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the stationarity equation:\n$$\n2 + y \\frac{(e^y+1)^2}{e^y} \\frac{e^y(1-e^y)}{(e^y+1)^3} = 0\n$$\n$$\n2 + y \\frac{1-e^y}{1+e^y} = 0\n$$\n$$\n2(1+e^y) + y(1-e^y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n2(e^y+1) = y(e^y-1)\n$$\nThis is the stationarity condition for the optimal dimensionless offset, $y^\\star$. Rearranging, we get a transcendental equation for $y^\\star$:\n$$\ny^\\star = 2 \\frac{e^{y^\\star}+1}{e^{y^\\star}-1} = 2 \\coth\\left(\\frac{y^\\star}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Connection to the Mahan–Sofo Criterion**\n\nThe Mahan–Sofo criterion addresses the question of what material properties would lead to the highest possible thermoelectric figure of merit, $ZT = S^2 GT/\\kappa$. Their analysis concluded that for a given electronic thermal conductivity, the optimal \"transport distribution function\" (which combines density of states and scattering effects) is a Dirac delta function, positioned at an optimal energy away from the Fermi level.\n\nOur result for maximizing the power factor $S^2 G$ directly mirrors this conclusion. We have rigorously shown that within the Landauer-Büttiker framework, the ideal transmission function $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ to maximize $S^2 G$ is precisely a Dirac delta function, $\\mathcal{T}(E) = A \\delta(E-E^\\star)$. The transmission function $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ in this ballistic, coherent transport model plays the same role as the transport distribution function in the semi-classical Boltzmann model used by Mahan and Sofo. Our derivation of the specific optimal energy offset $y^\\star$ is the explicit solution for the delta function's optimal position for maximizing the power factor.\n\n**4. Numerical Computation of $y^\\star$**\n\nThe optimal offset $y^\\star$ is the solution to the transcendental equation $y = 2 \\coth(y/2)$. The function $g(y)$ we maximized is even, so there is a positive solution $y^\\star$ and a negative solution $-y^\\star$, which yield the same maximal power factor. We solve for the positive root. This equation cannot be solved analytically but is straightforward to solve numerically using methods like fixed-point iteration or Newton-Raphson. Solving the equation $y - 2\\coth(y/2) = 0$ yields a numerical value.\n$$\ny^\\star \\approx 2.39935\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the optimal dimensionless offset is $2.399$.",
