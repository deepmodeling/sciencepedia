The factor of $1/3$ arises from averaging over spatial directions.\n\nThe problem specifies the Debye model for a three-dimensional, isotropic solid. In this model:\n1.  The dispersion relation is linear: $\\omega = v q$, where $v$ is a single, averaged sound speed, independent of frequency and polarization. The group velocity $v_{g} = d\\omega/dq = v$.\n2.  There is a cutoff frequency $\\omega_{D}$, the Debye frequency, such that the total number of vibrational modes equals $3N$, where $N$ is the number of atoms.

The BTE becomes:\n$$ iq v_x \\tilde{g} + \\frac{\\tilde{g}}{\\tau} = -v_x (iq \\Delta T) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial T} $$\nSolving for the complex amplitude $\\tilde{g}$:\n$$ \\tilde{g}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{-iq v_x \\Delta T (\\partial f_0 / \\partial T)}{1/\\tau + iq v_x} = \\frac{-iq v_x \\tau \\Delta T (\\partial f_0 / \\partial T)}{1 + iq v_x \\tau} $$\nThe heat flux along the $x$-direction for a single phonon mode (characterized by a specific frequency, polarization, velocity magnitude $v$, and relaxation time $\\tau$) is found by integrating the energy flux over all propagation directions. The contribution from phonons with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is $v_x \\hbar\\omega g$. The total heat flux is $J_x(x) = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{J}_x e^{iqx}\\}$, where $\\tilde{J}_x$ is the complex amplitude of the flux integrated over all solid angles:\n$$ \\tilde{J}_x = \\int_{4\\pi} v_x (\\hbar \\omega) \\tilde{g}(\\mathbf{v}) D(\\omega) \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi} $$\nwhere $D(\\omega)$ is the density of states and the integration is normalized by $4\\pi$. Substituting $\\tilde{g}$:\n$$ \\tilde{J}_x = \\int_{4\\pi} v_x \\hbar \\omega \\frac{-iq v_x \\tau \\Delta T (\\partial f_0 / \\partial T)}{1 + iq v_x \\tau} D(\\omega) \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi} $$\nLet $C_{\\mathrm{mode}} = \\hbar \\omega (\\partial f_0 / \\partial T) D(\\omega)$ be the modal heat capacity.\n$$ \\tilde{J}_x = -iq \\Delta T \\int_{4\\pi} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} \\frac{v_x^2 \\tau}{1 + iq v_x \\tau} \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi} $$\nThe effective thermal conductivity for this mode, $k_{\\mathrm{eff,mode}}(q)$, relates the flux to the temperature gradient via Fourier's law in the spatial frequency domain: $\\tilde{J}_x = -k_{\\mathrm{eff,mode}}(q) (iq \\Delta T)$. Comparing this with the expression above, we get:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff,mode}}(q) = \\int_{4\\pi} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} \\frac{v_x^2 \\tau}{1 + iq v_x \\tau} \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi} $$\nWe use spherical coordinates where $v_x = v \\mu$, with $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$. The integral over solid angle $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi = -d\\mu d\\phi$ becomes:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff,mode}}(q) = C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\phi}{4\\pi} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2}{1 + iq v \\tau \\mu} d\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2}{1 + iq v \\tau \\mu} d\\mu $$\nThe problem is steady-state, so the effective conductivity must be a real quantity that relates the dissipative flux (in phase with $\\nabla T$) to the gradient. We take the real part of the expression. Let $a = qv\\tau = q\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the mean free path.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff,mode}}(q) = \\text{Re} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2 (1 - ia\\mu)}{1 + a^2\\mu^2} d\\mu \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2}{1 + a^2\\mu^2} d\\mu $$\nThe bulk thermal conductivity for this mode is $k_{\\mathrm{bulk,mode}} = \\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau$. The suppression function $S(a)$ is the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{eff,mode}}(q) / k_{\\mathrm{bulk,mode}}$:\n$$ S(a) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2}{1 + a^2\\mu^2} d\\mu}{\\frac{1}{3} C_{\\mathrm{mode}} v^2 \\tau} = \\frac{3}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2}{1 + a^2\\mu^2} d\\mu $$\nTo evaluate the integral: let $u=a\\mu$, so $d\\mu=du/a$.\n$$ \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{\\mu^2}{1 + a^2\\mu^2} d\\mu = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\frac{(u/a)^2}{1+u^2} \\frac{du}{a} = \\frac{1}{a^3} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\frac{u^2}{1+u^2} du = \\frac{1}{a^3} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1+u^2}\\right) du $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{a^3} [u - \\arctan(u)]_{-a}^{a} = \\frac{1}{a^3} [ (a - \\arctan(a)) - (-a - \\arctan(-a)) ] = \\frac{2a - 2\\arctan(a)}{a^3} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $S(a)$:\n$$ S(a) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left[ \\frac{2a - 2\\arctan(a)}{a^3} \\right] = \\frac{3(a - \\arctan(a))}{a^3} = \\frac{3}{a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\arctan(a)}{a} \\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Effective Thermal Conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(q)$**\n\nThe total effective thermal conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(q)$ is obtained by integrating the contributions from all phonons, weighted by their contribution to the bulk conductivity, over the mean free path ($\\Lambda$) spectrum.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(q) = \\int_0^{\\infty} S(q\\Lambda) \\frac{dk_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)}{d\\Lambda} d\\Lambda $$\nFrom the given cumulative spectrum, we find the differential contribution to thermal conductivity, $\\frac{dk_{\\mathrm{cum}}}{d\\Lambda}$:\n$$ \\frac{dk_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)}{d\\Lambda} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\Lambda_{\\max}}, & 0 \\le \\Lambda \\le \\Lambda_{\\max} \\\\ 0, & \\Lambda > \\Lambda_{\\max} \\end{cases} $$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(q)$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(q) = \\int_0^{\\Lambda_{\\max}} S(q\\Lambda) \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\Lambda_{\\max}} d\\Lambda = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{\\Lambda_{\\max}} \\int_0^{\\Lambda_{\\max}} \\frac{3}{(q\\Lambda)^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\arctan(q\\Lambda)}{q\\Lambda} \\right) d\\Lambda $$\nWe perform a change of variables with $a = q\\Lambda$, so $d\\Lambda = da/q$.
