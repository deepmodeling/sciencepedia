All provided parameters are physically realistic for the specified material class and experimental conditions. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts: first, determining the equilibrium carrier densities; second, deriving the small-signal Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetime; and third, calculating the numerical values for the lifetimes and their final ratio.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Carrier Concentrations**\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations of electrons ($n_0$) and holes ($p_0$) are determined by the interplay of charge neutrality and the law of mass action. The charge neutrality condition in a semiconductor doped with both donors and acceptors is given by:\n$$ p_0 + N_{D}^{+} = n_0 + N_{A}^{-} $$\nwhere $N_{D}^{+}$ is the concentration of ionized donors and $N_{A}^{-}$ is the concentration of ionized acceptors. The problem states that all dopants are fully ionized, so $N_{D}^{+} = N_{D}$ and $N_{A}^{-} = N_{A}$.\n\nThe law of mass action for a non-degenerate semiconductor at thermal equilibrium states that the product of the electron and hole concentrations is a constant, equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$:\n$$ n_0 p_0 = n_i^2 $$\n\nWe analyze the $n$-type and $p$-type samples separately.\n\nFor the $n$-type sample:\nThis sample is doped only with donors, so $N_{A} = 0$, and the given donor density is $N_{D} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The charge neutrality equation becomes:\n$$ p_0 + N_{D} = n_0 $$\nSince the doping concentration $N_{D} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ is many orders of magnitude greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, the material is strongly $n$-type.\nThis implies that the majority carrier concentration, $n_0$, is much larger than the minority carrier concentration, $p_0$. Thus, we can approximate the neutrality equation as:\n$$ n_0 \\approx N_{D} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} $$\nThe minority carrier concentration $p_0$ can then be found from the law of mass action:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} $$\n\nFor the $p$-type sample:\nThis sample is doped only with acceptors, so $N_{D} = 0$, and the given acceptor density is $N_{A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The charge neutrality equation becomes:\n$$ p_0 = n_0 + N_{A} $$\nSince $N_{A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\gg n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, the material is strongly $p$-type.

Derivation of the Small-Signal Effective SRH Lifetime**\n\nThe net recombination rate through a single-level trap, $U_{SRH}$, is given by the Shockley-Read-Hall expression:\n$$ U_{SRH} = \\frac{np - n_i^2}{\\tau_{p0}(n+n_1) + \\tau_{n0}(p+p_1)} $$\nHere, $n$ and $p$ are the total carrier concentrations under illumination. The characteristic lifetimes for holes and electrons are defined as $\\tau_{p0} = (N_t \\sigma_p v_{th})^{-1}$ and $\\tau_{n0} = (N_t \\sigma_n v_{th})^{-1}$, respectively, where $N_t$ is the trap density, $\\sigma_p$ and $\\sigma_n$ are the capture cross-sections, and $v_{th}$ is the thermal velocity. The terms $n_1$ and $p_1$ are carrier concentrations when the Fermi level aligns with the trap energy level $E_t$:\n$$ n_1 = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_t - E_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_1 = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_t}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that the trap level is at midgap, i.e., $E_t = E_i$. This simplifies $n_1$ and $p_1$ to:\n$$ n_1 = n_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_1 = n_i $$\nThe SRH rate expression becomes:\n$$ U_{SRH} = \\frac{np - n_i^2}{\\tau_{p0}(n+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p+n_i)} $$\nUnder low-level injection, a small excess concentration of electron-hole pairs, $\\Delta n = \\Delta p$, is generated. The total concentrations are $n = n_0 + \\Delta n$ and $p = p_0 + \\Delta p = p_0 + \\Delta n$. Substituting these into the numerator:\n$$ np - n_i^2 = (n_0 + \\Delta n)(p_0 + \\Delta n) - n_0p_0 = n_0p_0 + n_0\\Delta n + p_0\\Delta n + (\\Delta n)^2 - n_0p_0 $$\nFor low injection, the $(\\Delta n)^2$ term is negligible. Thus, the numerator simplifies to:\n$$ np - n_i^2 \\approx (n_0 + p_0)\\Delta n $$\nIn the denominator, we also assume $\\Delta n$ is small compared to the equilibrium concentrations, so $n \\approx n_0$ and $p \\approx p_0$. The denominator becomes:\n$$ \\tau_{p0}(n_0+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+n_i) $$\nThe net recombination rate is then approximated as:\n$$ U_{SRH} \\approx \\frac{(n_0 + p_0)\\Delta n}{\\tau_{p0}(n_0+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+n_i)} $$\nThe small-signal effective lifetime, $\\tau_{eff}$, is defined by the relation $U_{SRH} = \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau_{eff}}$. By comparing the two expressions for $U_{SRH}$, we derive the formula for the effective lifetime:\n$$ \\tau_{eff} = \\frac{\\tau_{p0}(n_0+n_i) + \\tau_{n0}(p_0+n_i)}{n_0+p_0} $$\n\n**3.

Carrier Densities ($n$ and $p$)**\nThe electron and hole densities are found by integrating their respective densities of states multiplied by their occupation probabilities:\n$$ n = \\int_{E_g}^\\infty D_{c,m}(E) f_c(E) dE \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} D_{v,m}(E) [1-f_v(E)] dE $$\nUsing the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation and the DOS form $D_m \\propto E^{m/2-1}$, both integrals result in a temperature dependence of $(k_B T)^{m/2}$. This term is the core of the effective density of states ($N_{c,m}$ and $N_{v,m}$).\n$$ n = N_{c,m}(T) \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}-E_g}{k_B T}\\right) \\propto (k_B T)^{m/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}-E_g}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ p = N_{v,m}(T) \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_{Fp}}{k_B T}\\right) \\propto (k_B T)^{m/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{-E_{Fp}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe product $np$ is then:\n$$ np \\propto (k_B T)^{m/2} (k_B T)^{m/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}-E_{Fp}-E_g}{k_B T}\\right) = (k_B T)^m \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}-E_{Fp}-E_g}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Temperature Scaling of $B_m$**\nNow we can find the scaling of $B_m = R_{\\mathrm{rad}} / (np)$:\n$$ B_m(T) \\propto \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{np} \\propto \\frac{(k_B T)^{m/2} \\exp\\left(\\dots\\right)}{(k_B T)^m \\exp\\left(\\dots\\right)} = (k_B T)^{m/2 - m} = (k_B T)^{-m/2} $$\nThe scaling exponent is therefore $\\alpha_m = -m/2$.\n\n**4. Exponents for Each Dimension**\nWe can now calculate the exponent for each dimensionality $m$:\n-   For **3D bulk** ($m=3$): $\\alpha_3 = -3/2$.\n-   For **2D quantum wells** ($m=2$): $\\alpha_2 = -2/2 = -1$.\n-   For **1D nanowires** ($m=1$): $\\alpha_1 = -1/2$.\n-   For **0D quantum dots** ($m=0$): $\\alpha_0 = -0/2 = 0$. In the 0D case, the density of states is a series of delta functions. The integral for the effective density of states becomes a constant, independent of temperature. This is consistent with the general formula yielding a temperature dependence of $(k_B T)^0=1$.\n\nThe requested row vector of exponents $[\\alpha_3\\ \\alpha_2\\ \\alpha_1\\ \\alpha_0]$ is therefore $[-3/2 \\ -1 \\ -1/2 \\ 0]$.",
