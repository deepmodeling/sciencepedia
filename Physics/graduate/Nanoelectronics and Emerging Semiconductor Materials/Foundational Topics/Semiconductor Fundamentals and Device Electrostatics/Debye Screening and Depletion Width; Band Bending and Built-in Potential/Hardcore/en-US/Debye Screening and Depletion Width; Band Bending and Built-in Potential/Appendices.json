            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard, well-posed exercise in semiconductor device physics. All parameters are physically realistic for a silicon $p$-$n$ junction, and the underlying model (abrupt junction, depletion approximation) is a fundamental concept in the field. The givens are self-contained and consistent, and the tasks are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution will proceed by addressing the three requested parts in sequence.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Depletion Width Partition\n\nThe depletion approximation posits that within the depletion region, which extends from $x = -W_p$ to $x = W_n$, the mobile carriers (electrons and holes) are negligible. The space charge density, $\\rho(x)$, is therefore determined solely by the fixed, ionized dopant atoms.\nOn the $p$-side, for $x \\in [-W_p, 0]$, the charge density is due to ionized acceptors: $\\rho(x) = -q N_A$.\nOn the $n$-side, for $x \\in [0, W_n]$, the charge density is due to ionized donors: $\\rho(x) = +q N_D$.\n\nAn essential condition for the $p$-$n$ junction as a whole is overall charge neutrality. The total negative charge in the $p$-side depletion region must exactly balance the total positive charge in the $n$-side depletion region. Let $A$ be the cross-sectional area of the planar junction.\n\nThe total positive charge $Q_+$ in the $n$-type depletion region is:\n$$\nQ_+ = \\int_0^{W_n} A \\rho(x) dx = \\int_0^{W_n} A (q N_D) dx = q A N_D W_n\n$$\n\nThe total negative charge $Q_-$ in the $p$-type depletion region is:\n$$\nQ_- = \\int_{-W_p}^{0} A \\rho(x) dx = \\int_{-W_p}^{0} A (-q N_A) dx = -q A N_A W_p\n$$\n\nFor charge neutrality, $Q_+ + Q_- = 0$:\n$$\nq A N_D W_n - q A N_A W_p = 0\n$$\n$$\nN_D W_n = N_A W_p\n$$\nThis equation represents the charge balance condition. By rearranging this expression, we obtain the ratio of the depletion widths:\n$$\n\\frac{W_n}{W_p} = \\frac{N_A}{N_D}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the ratio of the depletion widths extending into the $n$-side and $p$-side is inversely proportional to the ratio of the doping densities on those same sides. The depletion region extends farther into the more lightly doped side.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Built-in Potential and Depletion Widths\n\nFirst, the built-in potential, $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$, is calculated. At thermal equilibrium, $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$ is the potential difference across the junction required to align the Fermi levels of the isolated $p$-type and $n$-type materials. It is given by the expression:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration. The term $V_T = k_B T/q$ is the thermal voltage.\nAt $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$, the thermal voltage is approximately $V_T \\approx 0.02585\\,\\text{V}$.\nUsing the given doping and intrinsic concentrations:\n$N_A = 3.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_D = 6.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$n_i = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$\n\nThe argument of the logarithm is:\n$$\n\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{16})(6.0 \\times 10^{17})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{34}}{1.0 \\times 10^{20}} = 1.8 \\times 10^{14}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{bi}} \\approx (0.02585\\,\\text{V}) \\ln(1.8 \\times 10^{14}) \\approx (0.02585\\,\\text{V})(32.824) \\approx 0.8485\\,\\text{V}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the total depletion width $W$. This is derived by twice integrating Poisson’s equation, $d^2\\phi/dx^2 = -\\rho(x)/\\varepsilon_s$, and relating the total potential drop to $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$. This procedure yields the standard formula for the total depletion width $W = W_n + W_p$:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_s V_{\\mathrm{bi}}}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)}\n$$\nFor calculation, we must use consistent SI units. The permittivity of silicon is $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F/m}) \\approx 1.036 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{F/m}$. The doping concentrations must be converted to $\\text{m}^{-3}$:\n$N_A = 3.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} = 3.0 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$N_D = 6.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} = 6.0 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\nThe elementary charge is $q \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$.\n\nLet's compute the reciprocal sum of concentrations:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} + \\frac{1}{6.0 \\times 10^{23}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3.0} \\times 10^{-22}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{60} \\times 10^{-22}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{20+1}{60}\\right) \\times 10^{-22} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{m}^3\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the equation for $W$:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.036 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{F/m}) \\times (0.8485\\,\\text{V})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}} \\left(3.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{m}^3\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{(1.097 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (3.5 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{m}^3)} = \\sqrt{3.840 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{m}^2} \\approx 1.960 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nIn more convenient units, $W \\approx 196.0\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nFinally, we partition this total width into $W_n$ and $W_p$ using the charge balance condition derived in Part 1:\n$W_n = W \\left(\\frac{N_A}{N_A + N_D}\\right)$ and $W_p = W \\left(\\frac{N_D}{N_A + N_D}\\right)$.\nNumerically, the ratio $N_A/N_D = (3.0 \\times 10^{16}) / (6.0 \\times 10^{17}) = 0.05$.\nThus, $N_D$ is $20$ times larger than $N_A$.\n$N_A + N_D = (3.0 \\times 10^{16}) + (6.0 \\times 10^{17}) = (0.3 \\times 10^{17}) + (6.0 \\times 10^{17}) = 6.3 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$\nW_n = (196.0\\,\\text{nm}) \\left(\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{16}}{6.3 \\times 10^{17}}\\right) = (196.0\\,\\text{nm}) \\left(\\frac{1}{21}\\right) \\approx 9.33\\,\\text{nm}\n$$\n$$\nW_p = (196.0\\,\\text{nm}) \\left(\\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{17}}{6.3 \\times 10^{17}}\\right) = (196.0\\,\\text{nm}) \\left(\\frac{20}{21}\\right) \\approx 186.7\\,\\text{nm}\n$$\nAs a check, $W_n + W_p \\approx 9.33 + 186.7 = 196.03\\,\\text{nm}$, which is consistent. We also see that $W_p/W_n \\approx 186.7/9.33 \\approx 20$, which matches $N_D/N_A$.\n\n### Part 3: Conceptual Explanation\n\nThe asymmetric extension of the depletion region is a direct consequence of the charge balance requirement $N_D W_n = N_A W_p$. To establish equilibrium, a certain amount of total charge per unit area, e.g., $Q' = q N_D W_n$, must be exposed on the $n$-side to balance the exposed charge $Q' = q N_A W_p$ on the $p$-side. On the side with a higher doping concentration (here, the $n$-side with $N_D = 6.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$), the required charge density is high. Therefore, only a narrow region $W_n$ needs to be depleted of mobile carriers to uncover the necessary total fixed charge. Conversely, on the lightly doped side (the $p$-side with $N_A = 3.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$), the density of fixed charges is much lower. To accumulate the same total charge magnitude, the depletion region must extend much deeper, resulting in a significantly wider $W_p$.\n\nThis phenomenon can also be viewed in terms of electrostatic screening. The Debye screening length, $L_D = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_s k_B T / (q^2 n_{maj})}$, where $n_{maj}$ is the majority carrier concentration, characterizes the distance over which an electric field is screened in a doped semiconductor. A higher doping level leads to a shorter Debye length, signifying a more effective screening of electric fields. Although mobile carriers are depleted in the space charge region, the underlying principle holds: the more heavily doped material is more \"electrically robust\" and resists the penetration of the electric field. Consequently, the field penetrates only a short distance ($W_n$) into the heavily doped $n$-side, while it extends much farther ($W_p$) into the lightly doped $p$-side.\n\nThe partition of the electrostatic potential drop follows the same asymmetry. The total potential drop is the built-in potential $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$. The potential drop across the $n$-side, $\\Delta V_n$, and the $p$-side, $\\Delta V_p$, can be found by integrating the electric field over each region. The electric field profile is triangular, peaking at $x=0$. The potential drop on each side is the area of the corresponding triangle in the field plot.\n$$\n\\Delta V_n = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathcal{E}_{max}| W_n = \\frac{q}{2\\varepsilon_s} N_D W_n^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_p = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathcal{E}_{max}| W_p = \\frac{q}{2\\varepsilon_s} N_A W_p^2\n$$\nThe ratio of the potential drops is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V_n}{\\Delta V_p} = \\frac{N_D W_n^2}{N_A W_p^2}\n$$\nUsing the charge balance relation $N_D W_n = N_A W_p$, we can substitute $N_D = N_A (W_p/W_n)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V_n}{\\Delta V_p} = \\frac{N_A (W_p/W_n) W_n^2}{N_A W_p^2} = \\frac{W_p W_n}{W_p^2} = \\frac{W_n}{W_p}\n$$\nFinally, using the result from Part 1, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V_n}{\\Delta V_p} = \\frac{N_A}{N_D}\n$$\nSince $N_D \\gg N_A$ in this case, it follows that $\\Delta V_p \\gg \\Delta V_n$. This confirms that the majority of the built-in potential drops across the lightly doped side of the junction, corresponding to the side with the larger depletion width.\n\nThe value requested for the final answer is the ratio $W_n/W_p$:\n$$\n\\frac{W_n}{W_p} = \\frac{N_A}{N_D} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}}{6.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}} = \\frac{3.0}{60} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $0.05000$.",

The ratio simplifies to:\n$$\nR(u_s) = \\frac{|\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{q} u_s| \\frac{q}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}{2 \\left| \\sinh\\left(\\frac{u_s}{2}\\right) \\right|} = \\frac{|u_s|}{2 \\left| \\sinh\\left(\\frac{u_s}{2}\\right) \\right|}\n$$\nThe function $R(u_s)$ is even, so we only need to consider $u_s  0$. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{u_s}{2 \\sinh(u_s/2)}  0.9\n$$\nTo find the maximum allowed value of $u_s$, we solve the equality:\n$$\n\\frac{u_{s,max}}{2 \\sinh(u_{s,max}/2)} = 0.9 \\implies u_{s,max} = 1.8 \\sinh(u_{s,max}/2)\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $u_{s,max}$. Let $x = u_{s,max}/2$. The equation to solve for $x  0$ is $2x = 1.8\\sinh(x)$, or $h(x) = 0.9\\sinh(x) - x = 0$. This equation has a non-trivial positive root that must be found numerically. Let this root be $x_{max}$. Then, $u_{s,max} = 2x_{max}$.\n\nOnce $u_{s,max}$ is found, the physical potential threshold $\\phi_{\\max}$ is determined for a given temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\max} = u_{s,max} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{q}\n$$\nBy the symmetry of the error function $R(u_s)$, the valid range for $\\phi_s$ is symmetric around $0$, so $\\phi_{\\min} = -\\phi_{\\max}$. The final range is $[\\phi_{\\min}, \\phi_{\\max}]$. The value of $u_{s,max}$ is a universal constant for this problem, independent of temperature. The program will first compute this constant and then apply it to each temperature in the test suite.",

This exercise moves beyond static models to explore the rich physics governing the Debye length ($L_D$), particularly the competing effects of thermal energy and carrier freeze-out at low temperatures .

            "problem": "A bulk, uniformly doped, $n$-type semiconductor with shallow donors of binding energy $E_B$ and donor degeneracy factor $g_D$ is considered. The donor concentration $N_D$ is fixed, the semiconductor relative permittivity is $\\varepsilon_r$ (assume the permittivity $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r$ is weakly temperature dependent and may be treated as constant over the range of interest), and the conduction band is parabolic with electron effective mass $m_e^*$. Assume the carriers are nondegenerate except where explicitly stated otherwise. The effective density of states (EDOS) in the conduction band is $N_C(T)$, and the donor level lies $E_B$ below the conduction band minimum. Starting from Poisson’s equation and equilibrium statistical mechanics, define the Debye screening length $L_D$ via the linear response of charge density to a small electrostatic perturbation and derive how $L_D$ scales with temperature $T$ in the following limiting regimes:\n- the extrinsic, fully ionized, nondegenerate regime at sufficiently high $T$,\n- the freeze-out regime at cryogenic $T$ where most donors are neutral.\nUse Fermi–Dirac statistics for donor occupancy, the Boltzmann approximation for conduction electrons when appropriate, and the parabolic-band EDOS. Based on these derivations, identify the correct statements about $L_D(T)$ and its implications for screening and depletion width/band bending. Select all that apply.\n\nA. In the nondegenerate, fully ionized regime with $n \\approx N_D$, the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann response gives $L_D \\propto \\sqrt{T}$ for fixed $N_D$, so $L_D$ decreases as $T$ is lowered. In the freeze-out regime, charge neutrality with Fermi–Dirac donor statistics and the parabolic-band EDOS yields $n(T) \\approx \\sqrt{g_D N_D N_C(T)} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{E_B}{2 k_B T}\\right)$ and therefore $L_D(T) \\propto \\exp\\!\\left(\\dfrac{E_B}{4 k_B T}\\right) \\, T^{1/8}$ up to material-dependent prefactors, so $L_D$ grows rapidly at cryogenic temperatures. Hence $L_D(T)$ is non-monotonic and exhibits a minimum near the onset of freeze-out; the depletion width and band-bending length scales expand at cryogenic $T$.\n\nB. $L_D$ decreases monotonically with decreasing $T$ for any $N_D$ because both the permittivity and $k_B T$ decrease with $T$, so screening always strengthens and the depletion width shrinks.\n\nC. $L_D$ increases monotonically as $T$ decreases because carriers always freeze out; the high-temperature dependence is negligible, so the depletion width always expands with cooling and there is no minimum in $L_D(T)$.\n\nD. If $N_D$ is high enough that the electron gas remains degenerate down to cryogenic temperatures, donor freeze-out is negligible and the appropriate screening is Thomas–Fermi rather than Debye; the screening length remains finite and is only weakly temperature dependent as $T \\to 0$, avoiding the exponential growth predicted by nondegenerate freeze-out.",
            "solution": "The analysis of the Debye length $L_D$ requires examining the temperature dependence of the screening carrier concentration in different regimes. The Debye length is generally defined via the linearized Poisson equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\phi/L_D^2$. For a system with mobile electrons and ionizable donors, the screening is due to both, and the inverse square of the Debye length is given by:\n$$ L_D^{-2} = \\frac{q^2}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{n_0}{k_B T} + \\frac{N_{D0}^+(N_D - N_{D0}^+)}{N_D k_B T} \\right) $$\nwhere $n_0$ is the equilibrium electron density and $N_{D0}^+$ is the ionized donor density.\n\n**Analysis of Statement A:**\n\n1.  **High-Temperature (Fully Ionized) Regime:** At high temperatures, all donors are ionized, so $n_0 \\approx N_D$ and $N_D - N_{D0}^+ \\approx 0$. The screening is dominated by the mobile electrons. The expression simplifies to $L_D^{-2} \\approx \\frac{q^2 n_0}{\\varepsilon k_B T}$. Since $n_0 \\approx N_D$ is constant, we get:\n    $$ L_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{q^2 N_D}} \\propto \\sqrt{T} $$\n    Thus, as temperature $T$ is lowered from this regime, $L_D$ decreases. This part of the statement is correct.\n\n2.  **Low-Temperature (Freeze-Out) Regime:** At cryogenic temperatures, $n_0 \\ll N_D$ and most donors are neutral ($N_D - N_{D0}^+ \\approx N_D$). The charge neutrality condition is $n_0 \\approx N_{D0}^+$. The screening term becomes $L_D^{-2} \\approx \\frac{q^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T} (n_0 + n_0) = \\frac{2q^2 n_0}{\\varepsilon k_B T}$.\n    The electron concentration $n_0$ is found by solving the charge neutrality equation $n_0 = N_D^+$, which, for the freeze-out regime, yields:\n    $$ n_0(T) \\approx \\sqrt{g_D N_D N_C(T)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{2 k_B T}\\right) $$\n    The effective density of states $N_C(T) \\propto T^{3/2}$. Therefore, $n_0(T) \\propto T^{3/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{2 k_B T}\\right)$.\n    Substituting this into the expression for $L_D$:\n    $$ L_D^2 = \\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{2q^2 n_0(T)} \\propto \\frac{T}{T^{3/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_B}{2 k_B T}\\right)} = T^{1/4} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_B}{2 k_B T}\\right) $$\n    $$ L_D(T) \\propto T^{1/8} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_B}{4 k_B T}\\right) $$\n    The exponential term dominates at low $T$, causing $L_D$ to grow rapidly as $T$ decreases. This part of the statement is correct.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since $L_D$ decreases with decreasing $T$ at high temperatures and increases with decreasing $T$ at low temperatures, the function $L_D(T)$ is non-monotonic and must have a minimum. A larger screening length implies weaker screening, allowing electric fields and band bending to extend over larger distances. Thus, depletion widths expand at cryogenic temperatures. Statement A is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D:**\n\nIf the doping density $N_D$ is high enough to cause the donor impurity states to form an impurity band that merges with the conduction band, the semiconductor becomes metallic. The electron gas is degenerate ($E_F > E_C$) and its concentration $n \\approx N_D$ is independent of temperature. In this case, donor freeze-out does not occur.\nThe appropriate screening model for a degenerate electron gas is the **Thomas-Fermi model**. The Thomas-Fermi screening length $L_{TF}$ is given by:\n$$ L_{TF} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{q^2 D(E_F)}} $$\nwhere $D(E_F)$ is the density of states at the Fermi energy. For a degenerate gas at low temperatures ($k_B T \\ll E_F$), $D(E_F)$ is approximately constant and non-zero. Consequently, $L_{TF}$ is finite and largely independent of temperature as $T \\to 0$. This behavior is fundamentally different from the exponential growth of the Debye length in the non-degenerate freeze-out regime. Therefore, screening remains effective at cryogenic temperatures. Statement D is correct.\n\n**Statements B and C** are incorrect as they claim monotonic behavior, contradicting the derived non-monotonic nature of $L_D(T)$ in the non-degenerate case.",
