The flat-band condition is reached when the energy bands in the semiconductor are not bent, which requires an applied gate voltage that offsets both the metal–semiconductor work function difference and any effective oxide charge.

            "solution": "The flat-band voltage, $V_{\\text{FB}}$, is the gate voltage applied to a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitor that results in zero band bending in the semiconductor. This condition is achieved when the applied voltage precisely counteracts the built-in potential arising from the work function difference between the metal and the semiconductor, $\\phi_{\\text{ms}}$, and the voltage drop across the oxide due to fixed charges, $Q'_{\\text{ox}}$. The formula for the flat-band voltage is:\n$$V_{\\text{FB}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\text{m}} - \\phi_{\\text{s}}}{q} - \\frac{Q'_{\\text{ox}}}{C'_{\\text{ox}}}$$\nHere, $\\phi_{\\text{m}}$ is the metal work function, $\\phi_{\\text{s}}$ is the semiconductor work function, $q$ is the elementary charge, $Q'_{\\text{ox}}$ is the fixed oxide charge per unit area, and $C'_{\\text{ox}}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area. We will calculate each term separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the semiconductor work function, $\\phi_{\\text{s}}$. The work function is defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level, $E_{\\text{vac}}$, and the Fermi level, $E_{\\text{F}}$:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{s}} = E_{\\text{vac}} - E_{\\text{F}}$$\nThe semiconductor's electron affinity, $\\chi$, is the energy difference between the vacuum level and the conduction band edge, $E_{\\text{c}}$:\n$$\\chi = E_{\\text{vac}} - E_{\\text{c}}$$\nCombining these, we express $\\phi_{\\text{s}}$ as:\n$$\\phi_{\\text{s}} = (E_{\\text{vac}} - E_{\\text{c}}) + (E_{\\text{c}} - E_{\\text{F}}) = \\chi + (E_{\\text{c}} - E_{\\text{F}})$$\nTo find the position of the Fermi level, $E_{\\text{F}}$, we use the properties of the p-type silicon substrate. For a nondegenerate p-type semiconductor, the hole concentration, $p$, is related to the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_{\\text{i}}$, and the energy separation between the intrinsic level, $E_{\\text{i}}$, and the Fermi level, $E_{\\text{F}}$, by:\n$$p = n_{\\text{i}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{\\text{i}} - E_{\\text{F}}}{k_{\\text{B}}T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. Assuming complete ionization of the acceptor dopants, the hole concentration is equal to the acceptor concentration, $p = N_{\\text{A}}$.
