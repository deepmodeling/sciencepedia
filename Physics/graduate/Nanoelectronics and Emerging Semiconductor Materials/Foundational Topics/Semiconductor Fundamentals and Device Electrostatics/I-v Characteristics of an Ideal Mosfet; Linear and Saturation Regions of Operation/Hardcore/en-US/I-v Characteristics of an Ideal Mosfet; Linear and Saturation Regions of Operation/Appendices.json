            "problem": "Consider an ideal, long-channel, $n$-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) operated in strong inversion, with negligible series resistances, no velocity saturation, and no channel-length modulation. The channel has width $W$ and length $L$, electron mobility $\\mu_{n}$, and oxide capacitance per unit area $C_{ox}$. The source is at $x=0$ and the drain at $x=L$. The gate-source voltage $V_{GS}$ exceeds the threshold voltage $V_{T}$ so that $V_{OV} \\equiv V_{GS} - V_{T} > 0$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the small-signal on-resistance $R_{on}$ and the saturation drain current $I_{D,sat}$ for an ideal n-channel MOSFET from first principles, and then to determine how these quantities scale when the channel width $W$ is doubled.\n\nWe begin by applying the gradual-channel approximation. The drain current $I_D$ is constant along the channel (from source at $x=0$ to drain at $x=L$) and is carried by the drift of electrons in the inversion layer. The current $I_D$ at any position $x$ is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the magnitude of the mobile inversion charge density per unit area $|Q_i(x)|$, the electron mobility $\\mu_n$, and the magnitude of the lateral electric field $E(x) = \\frac{dV}{dx}$, where $V(x)$ is the channel potential.\n\nThe inversion charge density per unit area, as given, is $Q_i(x) = -C_{ox}\\big(V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)\\big)$. A conducting channel exists for $V_{GS} - V_T > V(x)$. Since the mobile charge carriers are electrons, the charge is negative. The magnitude of the mobile charge density is $|Q_i(x)| = C_{ox}\\big(V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)\\big)$.\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ can thus be written as:\n$$I_D = W |Q_i(x)| \\mu_n E(x) = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\big(V_{GS} - V_T - V(x)\\big) \\frac{dV}{dx}$$\nThis equation holds for a position $x$ along the channel, provided the device is operating in the linear (triode) region. To find the total current as a function of the terminal voltages, we must integrate along the channel. We rearrange the equation to separate variables $x$ and $V$:\n$$I_D \\, dx = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\big(V_{GS} - V_T - V\\big) \\, dV$$\nWe integrate this expression from the source to the drain. The position $x$ goes from $0$ to $L$, and the channel potential $V(x)$ goes from $V(0)=0$ (source potential) to $V(L)=V_{DS}$ (drain potential).\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} I_D \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{V_{DS}} W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\big(V_{GS} - V_T - V\\big) \\, dV$$\nSince $I_D$ is constant with respect to $x$, and $W$, $\\mu_n$, $C_{ox}$ are constants, we have:\n$$I_D \\int_{0}^{L} dx = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{V_{DS}} \\big((V_{GS} - V_T) - V\\big) \\, dV$$\n$$I_D L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_{0}^{V_{DS}}$$\n$$I_D L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\nSolving for $I_D$, we obtain the general current-voltage relationship in the linear region:\n$$I_D = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\nThis equation is valid as long as a continuous channel exists from source to drain, i.e., $|Q_i(L)| \\ge 0$, which implies $V_{GS} - V_T - V_{DS} \\ge 0$, or $V_{DS} \\le V_{GS} - V_T$.\n\nFirst, we derive the small-signal on-resistance $R_{on}$. It is defined in the limit of very small drain-source voltage, $V_{DS} \\to 0$:\n$$R_{on} = \\lim_{V_{DS} \\to 0} \\frac{V_{DS}}{I_D}$$\nFor $V_{DS} \\to 0$, the quadratic term $\\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2$ in the expression for $I_D$ becomes negligible compared to the linear term. The expression for $I_D$ simplifies to:\n$$I_D \\approx \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS}$$\nThe channel conductance $G_{on} = I_D/V_{DS}$ in this limit is:\n$$G_{on} = \\frac{1}{R_{on}} = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)$$\nTherefore, the on-resistance is:\n$$R_{on} = \\frac{L}{W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)}$$\n\nNext, we derive the saturation drain current $I_{D,sat}$. Saturation begins when the channel pinches off at the drain end ($x=L$). This occurs when the inversion charge density at the drain becomes zero: $|Q_i(L)| = 0$. Using the expression for the charge, this condition is:\n$$C_{ox}\\big(V_{GS} - V_T - V(L)\\big) = 0$$\nSince $V(L) = V_{DS}$, the pinch-off condition is met at a specific drain-source voltage, known as the saturation voltage $V_{DS,sat}$:\n$$V_{DS,sat} = V_{GS} - V_T$$\nThe saturation current $I_{D,sat}$ is the value of the drain current at the onset of saturation, i.e., when $V_{DS} = V_{DS,sat}$. We substitute $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_T$ into the general $I_D$ equation derived earlier:\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)(V_{GS} - V_T) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right)$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right)$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\nFor $V_{DS} > V_{DS,sat}$, in this ideal model with no channel-length modulation, the current remains constant at this value.\n\nNow, we evaluate how $R_{on}$ and $I_{D,sat}$ change when the channel width $W$ is doubled to $2W$, while all other parameters ($L$, $\\mu_n$, $C_{ox}$, $V_{GS}$, $V_T$) remain fixed.\nLet the initial values be $R_{on,1}$ and $I_{D,sat,1}$ corresponding to width $W$.\n$$R_{on,1} = \\frac{L}{W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)}$$\n$$I_{D,sat,1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\nLet the new values be $R_{on,2}$ and $I_{D,sat,2}$ corresponding to the new width $W' = 2W$.\nThe new on-resistance is:\n$$R_{on,2} = \\frac{L}{(2W) \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{L}{W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} R_{on,1}$$\nThe multiplicative change factor for $R_{on}$ is $\\frac{R_{on,2}}{R_{on,1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe new saturation current is:\n$$I_{D,sat,2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(2W)}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{W}{L} \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right) = 2 I_{D,sat,1}$$\nThe multiplicative change factor for $I_{D,sat}$ is $\\frac{I_{D,sat,2}}{I_{D,sat,1}} = 2$.\n\nThe two dimensionless multiplicative change factors, ordered as ($R_{on}$ factor, $I_{D,sat}$ factor), are $(\\frac{1}{2}, 2)$.",

            "solution": "### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ in an n-channel MOSFET is due to the drift of electrons in the inversion layer from the source to the drain. Let $y$ be the position along the channel, with $y=0$ at the source and $y=L$ at the drain, where $L$ is the channel length. The channel width is $W$. The channel potential at position $y$ is $V(y)$, with boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ (source is grounded) and $V(L)=V_{DS}$.\n\nThe drift current is driven by the lateral electric field $E_y(y) = -\\frac{dV(y)}{dy}$. Under the charge-sheet approximation, the inversion charge per unit area, $Q_I(y)$ (a negative quantity for electrons), is related to the local gate-to-channel voltage, $V_{GS} - V(y)$.\nUsing the one-dimensional parallel-plate capacitor model for the gate stack, the magnitude of the mobile inversion charge per unit area is given by:\n$$|Q_I(y)| = C_{ox} (V_{GC}(y) - V_{TH}) = C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(y) - V_{TH})$$\nThis expression is valid as long as an inversion channel exists, i.e., for $V_{GS} - V(y) \\ge V_{TH}$.\n\nThe sheet conductivity of the inversion layer is $\\sigma_s(y) = |Q_I(y)| \\mu$. The resistance $dR$ of a differential segment of the channel of length $dy$ is:\n$$dR = \\frac{dy}{W \\sigma_s(y)} = \\frac{dy}{W \\mu |Q_I(y)|} = \\frac{dy}{W \\mu C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(y) - V_{TH})}$$\nAccording to Ohm's law, the voltage drop $dV(y)$ across this differential resistance is $dV = I_D dR$. The drain current $I_D$ must be constant along the channel.\n$$dV = I_D \\frac{dy}{W \\mu C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(y) - V_{TH})}$$\nTo find the total current, we rearrange and integrate along the channel from source to drain.\n$$I_D \\, dy = W \\mu C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{TH} - V) \\, dV$$\n$$\\int_0^L I_D \\, dy = \\int_0^{V_{DS}} W \\mu C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{TH} - V) \\, dV$$\nSince $I_D$, $W$, $\\mu$, and $C_{ox}$ are constants:\n$$I_D [y]_0^L = W \\mu C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_{TH})V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_0^{V_{DS}}$$\n$$I_D L = W \\mu C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_{TH})V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\nThis yields the general current-voltage relationship for the ideal long-channel MOSFET:\n$$I_D = \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_{TH})V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right)$$\n\n**Condition for Saturation**\nThe above equation holds as long as an inversion channel exists along the entire length of the device, i.e., $|Q_I(y)| > 0$ for all $y \\in [0, L]$. The inversion charge is weakest at the drain end ($y=L$), where the channel potential is highest ($V(L) = V_{DS}$). The channel is said to \"pinch off\" at the drain when the inversion charge density there drops to zero. The condition for this is:\n$$|Q_I(L)| = C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(L) - V_{TH}) = 0$$\n$$V_{GS} - V_{DS} - V_{TH} = 0$$\nThis gives the drain-to-source voltage at which saturation begins:\n$$V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{TH}$$\nThis value is defined as the saturation voltage, $V_{D,\\text{sat}} \\equiv V_{GS} - V_{TH}$.\nThe region where $0 \\le V_{DS} < V_{D,\\text{sat}}$ is the linear (or triode) region.
