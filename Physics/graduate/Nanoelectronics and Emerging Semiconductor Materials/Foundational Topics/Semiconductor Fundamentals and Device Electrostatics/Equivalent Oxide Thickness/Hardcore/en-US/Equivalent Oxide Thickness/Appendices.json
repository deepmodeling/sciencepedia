Let us define the constant scaling factor $k = \\frac{\\kappa_{IL}}{\\kappa_{hk}}$. Then, $t_{EOT} = t_{IL} + k \\, t_{hk}$.\nFor a general linear combination of two correlated random variables $X$ and $Y$ of the form $Z = aX + bY$, the variance of $Z$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(Z) = a^{2} \\text{Var}(X) + b^{2} \\text{Var}(Y) + 2ab \\, \\text{Cov}(X,Y)\n$$\nThe covariance, $\\text{Cov}(X,Y)$, is related to the correlation coefficient $\\rho_{XY}$ and the standard deviations $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$ by $\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \\rho_{XY} \\sigma_X \\sigma_Y$.\n\nIn our specific case, $X=t_{IL}$, $Y=t_{hk}$, $Z=t_{EOT}$, $a=1$, and $b=k=\\frac{\\kappa_{IL}}{\\kappa_{hk}}$.

These two are in parallel, so $C_{\\text{semiconductor}} = C_s + C_{\\text{it}}$. The response of interface traps is frequency-dependent.\n\nAt high frequency (HF), the interface traps cannot respond to the fast AC signal. Therefore, their contribution is null ($C_{\\text{it}} \\approx 0$). The semiconductor capacitance is simply the depletion capacitance: $C_{\\text{semiconductor, HF}} = C_s$.

We denote the true oxide capacitance as $C_{\\text{ox,true}}$. From Equation 1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{ox,true}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{HF}}} - \\frac{1}{C_s} = \\frac{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{HF}}}{C_s C_{\\mathrm{HF}}} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{ox,true}} = \\frac{C_s C_{\\mathrm{HF}}}{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{HF}}} $$\nThe corresponding correct EOT is $t_{\\text{EOT,true}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} / C_{\\text{ox,true}}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Incorrect EOT**\nThe incorrect analysis uses the low-frequency measurement, $C_{\\mathrm{LF}}$, but erroneously neglects the interface trap capacitance, assuming $C_{\\text{semiconductor}} = C_s$. Let the incorrectly extracted oxide capacitance be $C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}$. The flawed model is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}} + \\frac{1}{C_s} $$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} - \\frac{1}{C_s} = \\frac{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{LF}}}{C_s C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}} = \\frac{C_s C_{\\mathrm{LF}}}{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} $$\nThe corresponding incorrect EOT is $t_{\\text{EOT,incorrect}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2} / C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Fractional Error**\nThe fractional error in the extracted EOT is defined as:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{t_{\\text{EOT,incorrect}} - t_{\\text{EOT,true}}}{t_{\\text{EOT,true}}} $$\nSubstituting the definitions of EOT in terms of oxide capacitances:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}}{C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}}{C_{\\text{ox,true}}}}{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}}{C_{\\text{ox,true}}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{ox,true}}}{C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}} - 1 $$\nNow, substituting the expressions for $C_{\\text{ox,true}}$ and $C_{\\text{ox,incorrect}}$:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = \\frac{\\frac{C_s C_{\\mathrm{HF}}}{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{HF}}}}{\\frac{C_s C_{\\mathrm{LF}}}{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{LF}}}} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{HF}}}{C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{LF}}}{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{HF}}} \\right) - 1 $$\nWe are given the values: $C_{s} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mF/m^2}$, $C_{\\mathrm{HF}} = 7.80\\,\\mathrm{mF/m^2}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{LF}} = 9.50\\,\\mathrm{mF/m^2}$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the fractional error:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = \\left( \\frac{7.80}{9.50} \\right) \\left( \\frac{10.0 - 9.50}{10.0 - 7.80} \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = \\left( \\frac{7.80}{9.50} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.50}{2.20} \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = (0.8210526...) \\times (0.2272727...) - 1 $$\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = 0.18660287... - 1 $$\n$$ \\text{Fractional Error} = -0.8133971... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fractional error is $-0.8134$.\n\n**4. Proposed Correction Strategy**\nThe error arises from misinterpreting a low-frequency measurement. The high capacitance value at low frequency, $C_{\\mathrm{LF}}$, is not solely due to the oxide and depletion regions, but includes a significant contribution from interface traps, $C_{\\text{it}}$. The incorrect analysis attributes this extra capacitance to the oxide, leading to an erroneously high $C_{\\text{ox}}$ and thus an erroneously small $t_{\\mathrm{EOT}}$.\n\nThe correction strategy involves a proper two-frequency measurement analysis to deconvolve the different capacitive components. This procedure, often called the high-low frequency method, consists of the following steps:\n\n1.  **Extract True Oxide Capacitance, $C_{\\text{ox}}$:** Perform a high-frequency $C$-$V$ measurement. In the depletion region, use the measured total capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{HF}}$ and the independently known (or calculated) depletion capacitance $C_s$ to find the true oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\text{ox,true}}$, using Equation 1:\n    $$ C_{\\text{ox,true}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{HF}} C_s}{C_s - C_{\\mathrm{HF}}} $$\n    This value is independent of interface trap effects.\n\n2.  **Calculate Corrected EOT, $t_{\\mathrm{EOT}}$:** The \"corrected\" EOT is the true EOT, calculated directly from the true oxide capacitance:\n    $$ t_{\\text{EOT,true}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{SiO}_2}}{C_{\\text{ox,true}}} $$\n\n3.  **Extract Interface Trap Capacitance, $C_{\\text{it}}$:** Use the now-known true value of $C_{\\text{ox,true}}$ along with the low-frequency measurement $C_{\\mathrm{LF}}$ in Equation 2 to solve for the total semiconductor capacitance at low frequency, $C_s + C_{\\text{it}}$.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{C_s + C_{\\text{it}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} - \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{ox,true}}} $$\n    This yields:\n    $$ C_s + C_{\\text{it}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{LF}} C_{\\text{ox,true}}}{C_{\\text{ox,true}} - C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} $$\n    Since $C_s$ is known, the interface trap capacitance can be isolated:\n    $$ C_{\\text{it}} = \\left( \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{LF}} C_{\\text{ox,true}}}{C_{\\text{ox,true}} - C_{\\mathrm{LF}}} \\right) - C_s $$\n    This quantity, $C_{\\text{it}}$, can then be used to calculate the density of interface states, $D_{\\text{it}} = C_{\\text{it}}/q$, where $q$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThis strategy correctly allocates the capacitive contributions, using the HF data to find the static gate stack property ($C_{\\text{ox}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{EOT}}$) and using the combined HF and LF data to find the dynamic interface property ($C_{\\text{it}}$).",
