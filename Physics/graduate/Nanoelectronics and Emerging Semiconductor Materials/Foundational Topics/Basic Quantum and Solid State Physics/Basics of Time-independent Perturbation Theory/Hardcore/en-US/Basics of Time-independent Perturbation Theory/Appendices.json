The application of time-independent perturbation theory and symmetry arguments (specifically, parity) to analyze the effect of a defect is a fundamental and correct approach in quantum mechanics. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem asks for the conditions under which a specific outcome ($E^{(1)}=0$, $E^{(2)}\\neq 0$) occurs. This is a well-defined question. The problem statement includes a key instruction: \"The unperturbed eigenstates $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ are nondegenerate (ignore accidental degeneracies)\". While the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator has essential degeneracies (states with the same principal quantum number $N = 2n_r + \\ell$ but different $\\ell$ are degenerate, where $n_r$ is the radial quantum number), the instruction to treat them as nondegenerate is a common pedagogical simplification. It directs the solver to use the formulas of nondegenerate perturbation theory and focus on the consequences of symmetry, which is the core of the problem. This assumption, though a simplification of the real physical system, makes the problem unambiguous and solvable within the specified framework.\n\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is phrased in precise, objective, and standard scientific language. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid** as a pedagogical exercise in quantum mechanics. It sets up a standard model and asks a well-posed question about the consequences of symmetry within perturbation theory, providing a clear (though idealized) framework for the analysis. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe core of the problem relies on the parity selection rule for matrix elements. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the parity operator, which performs an inversion of coordinates: $\\mathbf{r} \\to -\\mathbf{r}$. The unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$ is inversion-symmetric, so $[\\mathcal{P}, H_0] = 0$. This means its eigenstates $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ can be chosen to be eigenstates of parity, which they are: $\\mathcal{P}|n \\ell m\\rangle = (-1)^\\ell |n \\ell m\\rangle$.\n\nThe perturbation $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ is centered at the origin and has a definite parity under inversion:\n-   Even perturbation: $\\mathcal{P}V'\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = V'(-\\mathbf{r}) = +V'(\\mathbf{r})$.\n-   Odd perturbation: $\\mathcal{P}V'\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = V'(-\\mathbf{r}) = -V'(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\n**First-Order Energy Shift:**\nAccording to nondegenerate perturbation theory, the first-order energy shift for a state $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ is given by the diagonal matrix element:\n$$ E^{(1)} = \\langle n \\ell m | V' | n \\ell m \\rangle $$\nLet's evaluate this using parity. The matrix element is an integral over all space. We can insert the identity operator $\\mathcal{P}^{-1}\\mathcal{P} = 1$ twice:\n$$ E^{(1)} = \\langle n \\ell m | \\mathcal{P}^{-1}\\mathcal{P} V' \\mathcal{P}^{-1}\\mathcal{P} | n \\ell m \\rangle $$\nUsing the fact that $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ is a parity eigenstate, $\\mathcal{P}|n \\ell m\\rangle = (-1)^\\ell |n \\ell m\\rangle$, and $\\langle n \\ell m|\\mathcal{P}^{-1} = \\langle n \\ell m|\\mathcal{P} = (-1)^\\ell \\langle n \\ell m|$.\n$$ E^{(1)} = \\langle n \\ell m| ((-1)^\\ell) (\\mathcal{P} V' \\mathcal{P}^{-1}) ((-1)^\\ell) | n \\ell m \\rangle = (-1)^{2\\ell} \\langle n \\ell m | (\\mathcal{P} V' \\mathcal{P}^{-1}) | n \\ell m \\rangle $$\nSince $(-1)^{2\\ell}=1$, we have:\n$$ E^{(1)} = \\langle n \\ell m | V'(-\\mathbf{r}) | n \\ell m \\rangle $$\nIf $V'$ is an odd function, $V'(-\\mathbf{r}) = -V'(\\mathbf{r})$. Then:\n$$ E^{(1)} = \\langle n \\ell m | -V' | n \\ell m \\rangle = -E^{(1)} $$\nThis implies $2E^{(1)}=0$, so $E^{(1)}=0$.\nIf $V'$ is an even function, $V'(-\\mathbf{r}) = +V'(\\mathbf{r})$. Then $E^{(1)}=E^{(1)}$, which gives no constraint. In general, for an even perturbation, $E^{(1)}$ is nonzero.\nTherefore, for the first-order shift to vanish *for any state* due to symmetry, the perturbation $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ must be **odd**.\n\n**Second-Order Energy Shift:**\nThe second-order energy shift is given by:\n$$ E^{(2)} = \\sum_{k' \\ne n\\ell m} \\frac{|\\langle k' | V' | n \\ell m \\rangle|^2}{E_{n\\ell m} - E_{k'}} $$\nwhere the sum is over all other states $|k'\\rangle = |n' \\ell' m'\\rangle$.\nFor $E^{(2)}$ to be nonzero, there must exist at least one state $|k'\\rangle$ for which the off-diagonal matrix element $\\langle k' | V' | n \\ell m \\rangle$ is nonzero.\nLet's analyze the parity of this matrix element. For it to be nonzero, the integrand $\\psi_{k'}^*(\\mathbf{r}) V'(\\mathbf{r}) \\psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r})$ must have an even part. The parity of the integrand is the product of the parities of its factors: $P_{\\text{integrand}} = P_{k'} \\times P_{V'} \\times P_{n\\ell m}$. For the integral to be non-zero, we must have $P_{\\text{integrand}} = +1$.\n\nWe are working under the condition derived above, that $V'$ is odd ($P_{V'} = -1$), to make $E^{(1)}=0$. The condition for a nonzero matrix element becomes:\n$$ P_{k'} \\times (-1) \\times P_{n\\ell m} = +1 \\implies P_{k'} = -P_{n\\ell m} $$\nThis means that an odd perturbation $V'$ only connects states of opposite parity. The initial state $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ has parity $(-1)^\\ell$. A non-zero matrix element requires the final state $|n' \\ell' m'\\rangle$ to have parity $(-1)^{\\ell'} = -(-1)^\\ell$. This condition can be met, for example, if $\\ell' = \\ell \\pm 1$.\nSince the problem assumes an infinite ladder of bound states, states with the required opposite parity are guaranteed to exist. Therefore, for an odd-parity perturbation, the matrix elements for the second-order shift are generically nonzero, leading to $E^{(2)} \\neq 0$.\n\n**Summary of Conditions:** A centrally-located, odd-parity perturbation $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ will produce a vanishing first-order energy shift for any parity eigenstate, but a generically nonzero second-order energy shift via coupling to states of opposite parity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ is odd under inversion through the center and transforms as the $q=0$ spherical component of a rank-$1$ tensor (a centered electric dipole aligned with $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$). For any definite-parity state $|n \\ell m\\rangle$, the first-order diagonal matrix element vanishes by parity, but the second-order shift is generically nonzero via virtual coupling to opposite-parity states obeying $\\Delta \\ell = \\pm 1$.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement perfectly matches our derivation. An electric dipole potential, e.g., $V' \\propto z$, is odd under inversion. As shown, this leads to $E^{(1)}=0$ for any parity eigenstate. A potential proportional to $z$ (or any component of a polar vector) transforms as a rank-1 spherical tensor. The Wigner-Eckart theorem dictates that such a perturbation induces transitions with selection rules $\\Delta \\ell = \\pm 1$. A change in $\\ell$ by an odd integer changes the parity of the state since $(-1)^{\\ell \\pm 1} = -(-1)^\\ell$. Thus, the perturbation couples the initial state to states of opposite parity, resulting in a non-zero second-order sum. The statement is entirely correct.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B) $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ is spherically symmetric and even under inversion (a scalar defect centered at $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{0}$). For any state with $\\ell \\neq 0$, the first-order shift vanishes because the wavefunction vanishes at $r=0$, while the second-order shift is nonzero due to virtual coupling to $\\ell=0$ states.**\n-   **Analysis:** This statement presents multiple issues.\n    1.  The perturbation is even. As derived, an even perturbation generally yields a *nonzero* first-order shift, $E^{(1)} \\neq 0$. The statement claims $E^{(1)}=0$ for states with $\\ell \\neq 0$ by arguing that their wavefunctions vanish at the origin. This is only true if the potential is a delta function, $V'(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\delta(\\mathbf{r})$. For a more general, smooth, even potential, $E^{(1)} = \\int |\\psi_{n\\ell m}|^2 V' d^3r$ would not be zero.\n    2.  Most importantly, this condition does not apply to all states. For s-wave states ($\\ell=0$), the wavefunction is non-zero at the origin, and $E^{(1)}$ would be non-zero even for a delta-function potential. The problem asks for a condition that applies to a *given* (i.e., any) parity eigenstate.\n    3.  The reasoning for the second-order shift is flawed. A spherically symmetric (scalar) perturbation is a rank-0 tensor. By the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it cannot change the angular momentum quantum numbers, so $\\Delta \\ell = 0$ and $\\Delta m = 0$. It cannot cause \"virtual coupling to $\\ell=0$ states\" if the initial state has $\\ell \\neq 0$.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C) $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ is odd under inversion but displaced by a small vector $\\delta \\mathbf{r} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ from the center. For parity eigenstates the first-order shift still vanishes, while the second-order shift remains zero to all orders linear in $|\\delta \\mathbf{r}|$.**\n-   **Analysis:** Let the odd potential be $V_0(\\mathbf{r})$. The displaced potential is $V'(\\mathbf{r}) = V_0(\\mathbf{r} - \\delta\\mathbf{r})$. The first-order shift is $E^{(1)} = \\int |\\psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 V_0(\\mathbf{r} - \\delta\\mathbf{r}) d^3\\mathbf{r}$. The integrand's symmetry is broken. The wavefunction density $|\\psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ is symmetric about $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{0}$, but the potential is antisymmetric about $\\mathbf{r}=\\delta\\mathbf{r}$. The overall integrand has no definite parity with respect to the origin, so the integral is not guaranteed to be zero. In fact, a Taylor expansion $V_0(\\mathbf{r}-\\delta\\mathbf{r}) \\approx V_0(\\mathbf{r}) - \\delta\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\nabla V_0(\\mathbf{r})$ leads to $E^{(1)} \\approx -\\delta\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\langle n \\ell m | \\nabla V_0 | n \\ell m \\rangle$. Because $V_0$ is odd, its gradient $\\nabla V_0$ is even. The matrix element of an even operator between states of the same parity is generally non-zero. Thus, $E^{(1)}$ is generally non-zero and linear in $|\\delta\\mathbf{r}|$. The premise that the first-order shift \"still vanishes\" is false.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D) $V'(\\mathbf{r})$ is odd under inversion through the center and the unperturbed level $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ is part of a twofold $\\pm m$ degeneracy. In any orthonormal basis within the degenerate subspace, the first-order energy shift for each basis vector vanishes, but the second-order shift is nonzero.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option introduces degeneracy, which directly contradicts the problem's explicit premise: \"The unperturbed eigenstates $|n \\ell m\\rangle$ are nondegenerate\". A solution must adhere to the problem's setup. Proposing a condition that violates a stated premise is invalid within the context of the problem. While the physical reasoning within the option is sound (an odd perturbation does not lift this degeneracy to first order because all matrix elements of $V'$ within the degenerate subspace are zero by parity, and the second-order shift is non-zero for the same reasons as in option A), it cannot be a correct answer because it rejects the problem's own rules. A meticulous reading requires rejecting any option inconsistent with the given premises.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the ground-state static polarizability $\\alpha$ of a shallow donor in gallium arsenide (GaAs) and its numerical evaluation. The system is modeled within the Effective Mass Approximation as a hydrogenic atom with modified parameters.\n\nThe starting point is the second-order energy correction to the non-degenerate ground state due to a perturbation $H'$. The general formula from time-independent perturbation theory for the energy shift of a state $|n^{(0)}\\rangle$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_n^{(2)} = \\sum_{k \\neq n} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)} | H' | n^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$ and its eigenstates $|k^{(0)}\\rangle$ and eigenvalues $E_k^{(0)}$ correspond to the hydrogenic donor problem. The perturbation is given by $H' = -eEz$, where $\\mathbf{E} = E\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is the applied uniform static electric field.\n\nFor the ground state, which we denote as $|1s\\rangle$ or $|100\\rangle$, the energy shift is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{1s}^{(2)} = \\sum_{k \\neq 1s} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)} | (-eEz) | 1s^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{1s}^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\nFactoring out the terms related to the electric field gives:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{1s}^{(2)} = (eE)^2 \\sum_{k \\neq 1s} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)} | z | 1s^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{1s}^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the static polarizability $\\alpha$ through the relation $\\Delta E^{(2)} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E^2$. Equating the two expressions for the second-order energy shift, we find an expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E^2 = (eE)^2 \\sum_{k \\neq 1s} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)} | z | 1s^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{1s}^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = -2e^2 \\sum_{k \\neq 1s} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)} | z | 1s^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{1s}^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}\n$$\nSince the ground state energy $E_{1s}^{(0)}$ is the lowest energy, the denominator $(E_{1s}^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)})$ is negative for all $k \\neq 1s$. This ensures that $\\alpha$ is a positive quantity, as physically expected. We can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\n\\alpha = 2e^2 \\sum_{k \\neq 1s} \\frac{|\\langle k^{(0)} | z | 1s^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_k^{(0)} - E_{1s}^{(0)}}\n$$\nThe direct evaluation of this sum-over-states is complex. However, the problem allows the use of well-tested results for the hydrogenic problem and scaling arguments. The Hamiltonian for the donor is:\n$$\nH_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*} \\nabla^2 - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r r}\n$$\nThis has the same mathematical form as the Hamiltonian for a standard hydrogen atom in vacuum:\n$$\nH_H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla^2 - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}\n$$\nThe donor Hamiltonian can be obtained from the hydrogen Hamiltonian by the following substitutions:\n1.  The electron mass $m_e$ is replaced by the effective mass $m^*$.\n2.  The vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$ is replaced by the medium permittivity $\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r$.\n\nThe polarizability of the ground state of a standard hydrogen atom is a well-established result:\n$$\n\\alpha_H = \\frac{9}{2} (4\\pi \\varepsilon_0) a_0^3\n$$\nwhere $a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}$ is the Bohr radius. To find the polarizability $\\alpha$ for the donor, we apply the aforementioned substitutions to the expression for $\\alpha_H$.\n\nFirst, the Bohr radius $a_0$ is transformed into an effective Bohr radius $a_B^*$ for the donor:\n$$\na_B^* = \\frac{4\\pi(\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r)\\hbar^2}{m^* e^2}\n$$\nThe polarizability formula involves the product of permittivity and a length cubed. Applying the substitutions to the hydrogen polarizability formula, we get:\n$$\n(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0) \\rightarrow (4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_0^3 \\rightarrow (a_B^*)^3\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the donor polarizability:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{9}{2} (4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r) (a_B^*)^3\n$$\nTo facilitate numerical calculation and to explicitly show the scaling, we can express $a_B^*$ in terms of $a_0$:\n$$\na_B^* = \\frac{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r\\hbar^2}{m^* e^2} = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}\\right) \\frac{m_e \\varepsilon_r}{m^*} = a_0 \\frac{m_e \\varepsilon_r}{m^*}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $a_B^*$ into the formula for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{9}{2} (4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r) \\left( a_0 \\frac{m_e \\varepsilon_r}{m^*} \\right)^3 = \\frac{9}{2} (4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 a_0^3) \\varepsilon_r \\left(\\frac{m_e}{m^*}\\right)^3 \\varepsilon_r^3\n$$\nCombining the terms with $\\varepsilon_r$, we arrive at the final symbolic expression:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{9}{2} (4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 a_0^3) \\left(\\frac{m_e}{m^*}\\right)^3 \\varepsilon_r^4\n$$\nThis expression clearly shows that the donor polarizability is the hydrogen polarizability $\\alpha_H = \\frac{9}{2}(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 a_0^3)$ multiplied by a dimensionless scaling factor $S = (\\frac{m_e}{m^*})^3 \\varepsilon_r^4$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n-   $m^*/m_e = 0.067$\n-   $\\varepsilon_r = 12.9$\n-   $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}$\n-   $a_0 = 5.29177210903 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m}$\n\nLet's calculate the components of the expression for $\\alpha$:\nThe dimensionless ratio terms:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m_e}{m^*}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.067}\\right)^3 \\approx (14.92537)^3 \\approx 3324.508\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_r^4 = (12.9)^4 = 27585.1761\n$$\nThe constant prefactors:\n$$\n\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5\n$$\n$$\n4\\pi \\approx 12.5663706\n$$\nThe remaining physical constants:\n$$\na_0^3 = (5.29177210903 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m})^3 \\approx 1.48187671 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{m}^3\n$$\nSubstituting all values into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = 4.5 \\times (4\\pi \\times 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (1.48187671 \\times 10^{-31}) \\times (3324.508) \\times (27585.1761)\n$$\nThe units are $(\\text{F}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-1}) \\cdot \\text{m}^3 = \\text{F}\\cdot\\text{m}^2 = (\\text{C}\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1})\\cdot\\text{m}^2 = \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}$, which is the required unit.\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 4.5 \\times (1.112650056 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times (1.48187671 \\times 10^{-31}) \\times (3324.508) \\times (27585.1761) \\, \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx (7.41503 \\times 10^{-41}) \\times (3324.508) \\times (27585.1761) \\, \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx (7.41503 \\times 10^{-41}) \\times (9.16918 \\times 10^7) \\, \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx 6.8003 \\times 10^{-33} \\, \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the numerical value for the polarizability is $6.80 \\times 10^{-33} \\, \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\cdot\\text{V}^{-1}$.",
