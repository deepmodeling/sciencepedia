This practice challenges you to derive the primitive vectors for the common body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices starting from their more familiar conventional representations . By calculating the primitive cell volume, you will directly verify the number of lattice points per cell, a foundational skill for any quantitative analysis of crystal structures.",

            "problem": "Consider two common Bravais lattices relevant to nanoelectronics and emerging semiconductor materials: the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice, typical of refractory metals, and the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, typical of many conductors. Let the conventional cubic cell of each lattice have lattice constant $a$ and be spanned by the orthonormal Cartesian basis $\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}\\}$ with edges of length $a$ along these directions.\n\nStarting from the conventional cubic description, construct a valid set of three primitive lattice vectors for the bcc lattice and, independently, for the fcc lattice.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of primitive lattice vectors for the body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattices, starting from their description in a conventional cubic cell of side length $a$. From these vectors, the volume of the primitive unit cell, $V_{\\text{prim}}$, is to be calculated and expressed as a fraction of the conventional cell volume, $a^3$. Finally, this result must be verified by counting the number of lattice points within the conventional cell.\n\nA Bravais lattice is an infinite array of discrete points with an arrangement and orientation that appears exactly the same from whichever of the points the array is viewed. Any lattice point can be reached from any other by a translation vector of the form $\\boldsymbol{R} = n_1 \\boldsymbol{a}_1 + n_2 \\boldsymbol{a}_2 + n_3 \\boldsymbol{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers and $\\{\\boldsymbol{a}_1, \\boldsymbol{a}_2, \\boldsymbol{a}_3\\}$ is a set of linearly independent primitive lattice vectors. The volume of the primitive cell, which is a minimum-volume cell containing exactly one lattice point, is given by the scalar triple product $V_{\\text{prim}} = |\\boldsymbol{a}_1 \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a}_2 \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_3)|$.\n\nLet the conventional cubic cell be defined by an origin at one corner and spanned by the orthonormal Cartesian basis $\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}\\}$, with edges of length $a$ aligned with these axes.\n\n**1. Body-Centered Cubic (bcc) Lattice**\n\nA bcc lattice is formed by placing lattice points at the corners of a conventional cubic cell and one additional point at the center of the cube. The coordinates of the corner points are $(ia, ja, ka)$ for integers $i, j, k$, and the body-centered points are located at positions displaced by $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})$ from each corner point.\n\nTo construct the primitive vectors, we select three linearly independent vectors that connect a chosen lattice point (the origin) to other lattice points, such that integer linear combinations of these vectors generate all lattice points and only lattice points. A common and valid choice for the bcc primitive vectors connects the lattice point at the origin to the body centers of three adjacent conventional cells. However, a more symmetric choice connects the origin point to three of its eight nearest neighbors, which are the body-centered points. Let us choose the following set of vectors:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\nTo justify this choice, we must show that these vectors generate the entire bcc lattice. For example, the vector to the nearest corner point along the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ axis, $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, can be formed by the sum $\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$. Similarly, $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} = \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}}$ and $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} = \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}}$. This confirms that all corner points of the infinite cubic lattice can be generated. The vector to the body center of the cell at the origin is $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}}$. This shows that the body-center points are also generated. This set of vectors thus correctly spans the bcc lattice.\n\nThe volume of the bcc primitive cell, $V_{\\text{prim,bcc}}$, is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of these vectors:\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,bcc}} = |\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{bcc}} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{bcc}} \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{bcc}})| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -a/2 & a/2 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & -a/2 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & a/2 & -a/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,bcc}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |(-1)(1-1) - 1(-1-1) + 1(1-(-1))| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0 + 2 + 2| = \\frac{4a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{2} $$\nThe dimensionless fraction of the conventional cell volume $a^3$ is:\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\text{prim,bcc}}}{a^3} = \\frac{a^3/2}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTo verify this, we count the number of lattice points per conventional bcc cell. There are $8$ corner points, each shared by $8$ adjacent cells, contributing $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ lattice point. There is $1$ body-centered point entirely within the cell, contributing $1$ lattice point. The total is $1+1=2$ lattice points per conventional cell. The volume per lattice point is therefore $V_{\\text{conv}}/2 = a^3/2$, which matches our derived $V_{\\text{prim,bcc}}$.\n\n**2. Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) Lattice**\n\nAn fcc lattice is formed by placing lattice points at the corners of a conventional cubic cell and at the center of each of its six faces.\n\nA convenient set of primitive vectors connects the lattice point at the origin to the centers of the three faces that meet at that origin:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) $$\nTo justify this choice, we verify that these vectors can generate the lattice. The vector to the nearest corner point along the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ axis is given by $\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{fcc}} - \\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} - (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$. Symmetrical combinations generate $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$ and $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$. Thus, all corner points are generated. The face-centered points are generated directly by the primitive vectors themselves (for the three faces meeting at the origin) and by sums like $\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + 2\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})$, which represents the center of the face on the $xy$-plane of the adjacent cell along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$. The set is therefore a valid basis for the fcc lattice.\n\nThe volume of the fcc primitive cell, $V_{\\text{prim,fcc}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,fcc}} = |\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,\\text{fcc}} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{a}_{2,\\text{fcc}} \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_{3,\\text{fcc}})| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a/2 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & 0 & a/2 \\\\ a/2 & a/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\text{prim,fcc}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0(0-1) - 1(0-1) + 1(1-0)| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0 + 1 + 1| = \\frac{2a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{4} $$\nThe dimensionless fraction of the conventional cell volume $a^3$ is:\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\text{prim,fcc}}}{a^3} = \\frac{a^3/4}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nTo verify this, we count the lattice points per conventional fcc cell. There are $8$ corners, contributing $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ lattice point. There are $6$ face centers, each shared by $2$ adjacent cells, contributing $6 \\times (1/2) = 3$ lattice points. The total is $1+3=4$ lattice points per conventional cell. The volume per lattice point is therefore $V_{\\text{conv}}/4 = a^3/4$, which matches our derived $V_{\\text{prim,fcc}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the two dimensionless volume fractions $V_{\\text{prim}}/a^{3}$ in the order (bcc, fcc).\nFor bcc, the fraction is $1/2$.\nFor fcc, the fraction is $1/4$.\nThe result is presented as a single row matrix.",

Express your answers as exact, closed-form expressions in terms of $\\pi$ and radicals. Provide the three packing fractions in the order SC, BCC, FCC, and do not round. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The packing fraction, which we denote as $PF$, is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by atoms within a unit cell to the total volume of the unit cell. For a crystal with identical spherical atoms, this can be expressed as:\n$$\nPF = \\frac{N_{\\text{atoms}} \\times V_{\\text{atom}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{atoms}}$ is the number of atoms per conventional unit cell, $V_{\\text{atom}}$ is the volume of a single atom (sphere), and $V_{\\text{cell}}$ is the volume of the conventional unit cell.\n\nThe problem specifies a conventional cubic unit cell of edge length $a$, so its volume is $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3$. The atoms are modeled as hard spheres of radius $r$, so the volume of a single atom is $V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. The problem states that the radius $r$ is determined by the condition that nearest-neighbor spheres are in contact. We will now apply this framework to each of the three specified cubic lattices.\n\n**1. Simple Cubic (SC) Lattice**\n\nIn the SC structure, there is one lattice point at each of the $8$ corners of the cube. Each corner atom is shared equally among the $8$ unit cells that meet at that corner. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit cell is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{SC}} = 8 \\, (\\text{corners}) \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\, (\\text{atom per corner}) = 1\n$$\nIn the SC lattice, the nearest neighbors are located along the edges of the cube. The centers of two adjacent corner atoms are separated by the lattice constant $a$. The nearest-neighbor contact condition implies that the distance between their centers is twice the sphere's radius, $2r$. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$\n2r = a \\implies r = \\frac{a}{2}\n$$\nThe total volume occupied by atoms in the unit cell is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{atoms, SC}} = N_{\\text{SC}} \\times V_{\\text{atom}} = 1 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}\n$$\nThe packing fraction for the SC lattice is the ratio of this volume to the cell volume $a^3$:\n$$\nPF_{\\text{SC}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{atoms, SC}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}}{a^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n$$\n\n**2. Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\n\nIn the BCC structure, there is one lattice point at each of the $8$ corners and one lattice point at the geometric center of the cube. The corner atoms are shared as before, while the body-center atom is entirely contained within the unit cell. The number of atoms per unit cell is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{BCC}} = \\left(8 \\times \\frac{1}{8}\\right) + 1 = 2\n$$\nIn the BCC lattice, the closest distance between atoms is along the space diagonal of the cube, connecting a corner atom to the body-center atom. The length of the space diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$. This diagonal contains half of one corner atom, the full diameter of the body-center atom, and half of the opposite corner atom. The total length is therefore $r + 2r + r = 4r$. The nearest-neighbor contact condition gives the relation:\n$$\n4r = a\\sqrt{3} \\implies r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n$$\nThe total volume occupied by atoms in the unit cell is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{atoms, BCC}} = N_{\\text{BCC}} \\times V_{\\text{atom}} = 2 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3}}{64} = \\frac{\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{8}\n$$\nThe packing fraction for the BCC lattice is:\n$$\nPF_{\\text{BCC}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{atoms, BCC}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{8}}{a^3} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8}\n$$\n\n**3. Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice**\n\nIn the FCC structure, there is one lattice point at each of the $8$ corners and one at the center of each of the $6$ faces.

The number of atoms per unit cell is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{FCC}} = \\left(8 \\times \\frac{1}{8}\\right) + \\left(6 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 + 3 = 4\n$$\nIn the FCC lattice, the closest distance is between a corner atom and an adjacent face-centered atom, along a face diagonal. The length of a face diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$. This diagonal contains half of one corner atom, the full diameter of the face-center atom, and half of the opposite corner atom on that face. The total length is $r + 2r + r = 4r$.
