            "problem": "A bulk, degenerately $n$-type emerging semiconductor is measured at temperature $T$ with direct-current conductivity $\\sigma$. The conduction at $T$ is dominated by one isotropic valley characterized by a conductivity effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ and electron density $n$. Assume that elastic scattering processes can be described by a single relaxation time $\\tau$ for that valley. Starting only from Newton’s second law and the definitions of drift velocity, current density, and conductivity, and invoking the momentum-relaxing form of the collision term consistent with the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) under the Relaxation-Time Approximation (RTA), derive an expression for $\\tau$ in terms of $\\sigma$, $n$, $m^{\\ast}$, and fundamental constants.

In your discussion, derive a closed-form analytic relation between the single-band apparent relaxation time and the true relaxation time of the primary band in terms of the ratios $\\eta = n_{2}/n_{1}$ and $r = \\mu_{2}/\\mu_{1}$, and explain the physical origin of any uncertainty introduced into $\\tau$ by multiband contributions to $\\sigma$.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard principles of solid-state physics and provides sufficient, consistent information for a complete solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the momentum relaxation time $\\tau$ for electrons in a single isotropic conduction band. We begin from Newton's second law applied to an average electron in the presence of a static electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. The net force on the electron is the sum of the electrostatic force and a frictional force representing momentum-relaxing scattering events.\n\nIn steady state (direct-current, or DC, conditions), the average momentum of the electron ensemble is constant, which implies the average acceleration is zero. The governing equation for the momentum $\\mathbf{p} = m^{\\ast}\\mathbf{v}_d$ of an electron with effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ and drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}_{net} = \\mathbf{F}_{elec} + \\mathbf{F}_{scat} = 0\n$$\nThe electrostatic force is given by $\\mathbf{F}_{elec} = -e\\mathbf{E}$, where $-e$ is the charge of an electron.\nThe scattering force, within the Relaxation-Time Approximation (RTA), is treated as a damping term that drives the average momentum back to zero. The rate of momentum loss due to scattering is given by $-\\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the momentum relaxation time. Thus, the scattering force can be written as $\\mathbf{F}_{scat} = -\\frac{m^{\\ast}\\mathbf{v}_d}{\\tau}$.\n\nSubstituting these forces into the steady-state equation of motion:\n$$\n-e\\mathbf{E} - \\frac{m^{\\ast}\\mathbf{v}_d}{\\tau} = 0\n$$\nSolving for the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_d = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is defined as the net charge flow per unit area per unit time. For electrons with density $n$ and charge $-e$, the current density is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = n(-e)\\mathbf{v}_d\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{v}_d$ into the equation for $\\mathbf{J}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = n(-e)\\left(-\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}\\right) = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThis equation relates the current density to the applied electric field. It is the microscopic form of Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma\\mathbf{E}$, where $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity. By comparing the two expressions for $\\mathbf{J}$, we can identify the conductivity as:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Drude formula for conductivity. The problem asks for an expression for the relaxation time $\\tau$. Rearranging the above equation gives the desired result:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{m^{\\ast}\\sigma}{ne^2}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to evaluate $\\tau$ using the provided parameters. The parameters are:\n- Electron density $n = 5.00 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- Effective mass $m^{\\ast} = 0.20\\, m_{0}$\n- Conductivity $\\sigma = 2.00 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$\n- Elementary charge $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- Electron rest mass $m_{0} = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nWe must use a consistent set of units (SI). The density $n$ must be converted from $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$:\n$$\nn = 5.00 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{18}\\ (\\text{10}^{-2} \\text{ m})^{-3} = 5.00 \\times 10^{18} \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}\n$$\nThe effective mass is:\n$$\nm^{\\ast} = 0.20 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 1.82187674 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{(1.82187674 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg})(2.00 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}})}{(5.00 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{3.64375348 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot S \\cdot m^{-1}}}{ (5.00 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}})(2.566970 \\times 10^{-38}\\ \\mathrm{C^2}) }\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{3.64375348 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot S \\cdot m^{-1}}}{1.283485 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3} \\cdot C^2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\approx 2.83896 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result in femtoseconds ($1\\ \\mathrm{fs} = 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{s}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\tau = 2.83896 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 28.3896 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 28.4\\ \\mathrm{fs}\n$$\n\nThe final task is to discuss the effect of multiband conduction. If conduction occurs in parallel through two bands (labeled $1$ and $2$), the total conductivity $\\sigma_{tot}$ is the sum of the individual conductivities:\n$$\n\\sigma_{tot} = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\sigma = ne\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the mobility, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{tot} = n_1 e \\mu_1 + n_2 e \\mu_2\n$$\nIf an experimentalist measures $\\sigma_{tot}$ and the total carrier density $n_{tot} = n_1 + n_2$, and incorrectly assumes a single-band model using the parameters of the primary band (band $1$), they would calculate an apparent mobility $\\mu_{app}$ and an apparent relaxation time $\\tau_{app}$. Let us assume the inversion uses the total density $n_{tot}$ and the primary band's effective mass $m_1^{\\ast}$.\nThe apparent conductivity is modeled as $\\sigma_{tot} = n_{tot} e \\mu_{app} = (n_1+n_2)e\\mu_{app}$. From this, the apparent mobility is:\n$$\n\\mu_{app} = \\frac{\\sigma_{tot}}{(n_1+n_2)e} = \\frac{n_1 e \\mu_1 + n_2 e \\mu_2}{(n_1+n_2)e} = \\frac{n_1 \\mu_1 + n_2 \\mu_2}{n_1+n_2}\n$$\nThe apparent mobility is a carrier-density-weighted average of the individual mobilities.\nThe apparent relaxation time $\\tau_{app}$ is then calculated from this apparent mobility using the primary band's effective mass: $\\tau_{app} = \\frac{m_1^{\\ast} \\mu_{app}}{e}$. The true relaxation time of the primary band is $\\tau_1 = \\frac{m_1^{\\ast} \\mu_1}{e}$.\nTo find the relationship between $\\tau_{app}$ and $\\tau_1$, we substitute the expression for $\\mu_{app}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{app} = \\frac{m_1^{\\ast}}{e} \\left( \\frac{n_1 \\mu_1 + n_2 \\mu_2}{n_1+n_2} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\mu_1$ and $n_1$:\n$$\n\\tau_{app} = \\frac{m_1^{\\ast} \\mu_1}{e} \\left( \\frac{n_1(1 + (n_2/n_1)(\\mu_2/\\mu_1))}{n_1(1 + n_2/n_1)} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the definitions $\\tau_1 = \\frac{m_1^{\\ast}\\mu_1}{e}$, $\\eta = n_2/n_1$, and $r = \\mu_2/\\mu_1$, we arrive at the closed-form relation:\n$$\n\\tau_{app} = \\tau_1 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\eta r}{1 + \\eta} \\right)\n$$\nThis relation reveals how the apparent relaxation time, derived from a single-band model, is biased by the presence of a second conduction channel. The physical origin of the uncertainty introduced into $\\tau$ stems from this very effect. A single macroscopic measurement of conductivity $\\sigma_{tot}$ convolves the contributions from all carrier populations. Without additional information to deconvolve these contributions (e.g., from temperature-dependent Hall measurements or Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations), one is forced to use a simplified model.\nThe single-band model erroneously attributes all conduction to a single population. The term $\\frac{1+\\eta r}{1+\\eta}$ is a correction factor that quantifies this error.\n- If the second band is more mobile ($r > 1$), the factor is greater than $1$, causing the apparent relaxation time $\\tau_{app}$ to overestimate the true primary-band relaxation time $\\tau_1$. This is because the highly mobile carriers in the second band contribute disproportionately to the total conductivity, making the \"average\" carrier appear more mobile (and thus have a longer relaxation time) than the carriers in the primary band actually are.\n- If the second band is less mobile ($r < 1$), the factor is less than $1$, leading to an underestimation of $\\tau_1$. The less mobile carriers act as a drag on the total conductivity, making the \"average\" carrier seem less mobile than those in the primary band.\nThe uncertainty in the extracted value of $\\tau$ is therefore a model-induced systematic error arising from ignorance of the true band structure and carrier distribution, specifically the parameters $\\eta$ and $r$ for all other contributing bands.",

The drift mobility is defined by $\\mu(T) = \\sigma(T)/(n(T)\\,e)$. Treat the band as parabolic and isotropic, and express $D(E)$ and $v_{x}^{2}(E)$ in terms of $m^{*}$ and $E$. Use a controlled low-temperature expansion (Sommerfeld expansion) up to order $\\big(k_{B}T/E_{F}\\big)^{2}$, where $E_{F}$ is the Fermi energy determined by $n$ and $m^{*}$.\n\nTasks:\n- Compute the exact low-temperature mobility $\\mu_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)$ by inserting $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E)$ into the conductivity integral, then expanding to order $\\big(k_{B}T/E_{F}\\big)^{2}$.\n- Compute the separate low-temperature mobilities $\\mu_{\\mathrm{alloy}}(T)$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ by inserting $\\tau_{\\mathrm{alloy}}(E)$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(E)$ individually into the conductivity integral and expanding to the same order. Combine them using Matthiessen’s rule at the mobility level, $1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{M}}(T) = 1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{alloy}}(T) + 1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$, to obtain $\\mu_{\\mathrm{M}}(T)$.\n- Evaluate the ratio $R \\equiv \\mu_{\\mathrm{exact}}(T)/\\mu_{\\mathrm{M}}(T)$ numerically at $T=77\\,\\mathrm{K}$, using $m^{*}=0.05\\,m_{e}$ and $n=2.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, with the given $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.
