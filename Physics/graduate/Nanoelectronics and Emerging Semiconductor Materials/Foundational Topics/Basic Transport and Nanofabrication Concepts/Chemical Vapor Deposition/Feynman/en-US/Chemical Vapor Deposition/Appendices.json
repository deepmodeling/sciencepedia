            "problem": "A low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process deposits a solid film from a dilute gaseous precursor species denoted by $A$. Consider a single, flat wafer over which a steady, one-dimensional boundary layer of gas of thickness $\\delta$ forms. The gas is isothermal, behaves ideally, and contains $A$ at a bulk concentration $C_{b}$ sufficiently small that $A$ can be treated as a dilute species in an otherwise inert carrier. The transport of $A$ across the boundary layer is by molecular diffusion with constant diffusivity $D$, and convection within the boundary layer can be neglected. At the wafer surface (taken as $y=0$), species $A$ incorporates into the solid via a first-order surface reaction with respect to the surface concentration, namely a surface reaction rate per area $r_{s}$ given by $r_{s} = k_{s} C_{s}$, where $C_{s}$ is the concentration of $A$ at the surface and $k_{s}$ is a kinetic coefficient. Let $y=\\delta$ denote the edge of the boundary layer, where the concentration of $A$ is $C_{b}$.\n\nStarting only from the steady one-dimensional species continuity in the gas film, Fick’s first law for a dilute species, and the boundary condition that the molar flux into the surface equals the surface consumption rate, derive a closed-form expression for the steady deposition flux $J$ onto the wafer in terms of $D$, $\\delta$, $k_{s}$, and $C_{b}$. Then introduce the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient $k_{g}$ defined by $k_{g} = D/\\delta$ and express $J$ solely in terms of $k_{s}$, $k_{g}$, and $C_{b}$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single, closed-form symbolic expression in $k_{s}$, $k_{g}$, and $C_{b}$ only.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe net molar flux $J$ in a CVD process can be modeled by considering the series resistances of gas-phase mass transport and surface reaction. The flux balance at steady state is given by:\n$$J = k_g (C_{\\infty} - C_s) = k_s C_s$$\nwhere $k_g$ is the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient, $k_s$ is the first-order surface reaction rate constant, $C_{\\infty}$ is the precursor concentration in the bulk gas, and $C_s$ is the precursor concentration at the substrate surface.\n\nBy eliminating the unknown surface concentration $C_s$, we can express the flux $J$ in terms of the known bulk concentration $C_{\\infty}$:\nFrom $J = k_s C_s$, we have $C_s = J/k_s$. Substituting this into the transport equation:\n$$J = k_g \\left( C_{\\infty} - \\frac{J}{k_s} \\right)$$\n$$J \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_g}{k_s} \\right) = k_g C_{\\infty}$$\n$$J = \\frac{k_g}{1 + k_g/k_s} C_{\\infty} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_g} + \\frac{1}{k_s}} \\right) C_{\\infty}$$\nThe problem defines the normalized rate as $j_n = J/C_{\\infty}$. Therefore,\n$$j_n = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_g} + \\frac{1}{k_s}}$$\nThis expression shows two limiting regimes based on temperature. The surface reaction rate constant $k_s$ is strongly temperature-dependent, following an Arrhenius law, $k_s(T) = A \\exp(-E_a/(k_B T))$, where $E_a$ is the activation energy. The mass transport coefficient $k_g$ is only weakly dependent on temperature.\n\n1.  **Low-Temperature Regime (Reaction-Limited)**: At low temperatures, $k_s$ is small ($k_s \\ll k_g$), so $1/k_s \\gg 1/k_g$. The expression for $j_n$ simplifies to $j_n(T) \\approx k_s(T)$.\n2.  **High-Temperature Regime (Transport-Limited)**: At high temperatures, the reaction is very fast ($k_s \\gg k_g$), so $1/k_s \\ll 1/k_g$. The expression for $j_n$ simplifies to $j_n(T) \\approx k_g$. This constant value is the transport-limited plateau, $j_{n}^{\\text{plat}}$.\n\nFirst, we must correct the measured concentrations and calculate the normalized rates $j_n(T)$ for all data points.

The bending moment per unit width is thus:\n$$\nM \\approx F_f \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2}\n$$\nFrom the theory of plate bending under biaxial loading, the relationship between the applied bending moment $M$ and the resulting curvature $\\kappa$ for a plate (the substrate) is given by:\n$$\nM = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa\n$$\nHere, $E_s$, $\\nu_s$, and $t_s$ are the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thickness of the substrate, respectively.\nEquating the two expressions for the moment $M$ yields:\n$$\n(\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2} = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} \\kappa\n$$\nSolving for the film stress $\\sigma_f$, we obtain the Stoney equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\frac{t_s^2}{6 t_f} \\kappa\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is the biaxial modulus of the substrate, denoted as $M_s$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_f = M_s \\frac{t_s^2}{6 t_f} \\kappa\n$$\nWe can now calculate the intrinsic stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{int}}$, by applying this equation to the state of the wafer immediately after deposition at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{dep}}$, using the corresponding measured curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{dep}}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} = M_s \\frac{t_s^2}{6 t_f} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{dep}}\n$$\nThe given values must be converted to base SI units for calculation:\nSubstrate Young's modulus: $E_s = 130\\ \\mathrm{GPa} = 130 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\nSubstrate Poisson's ratio: $\\nu_s = 0.28$\nSubstrate thickness: $t_s = 725\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} = 725 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\nFilm thickness: $t_f = 300\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 300 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\nCurvature at deposition temperature: $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 1.328 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the biaxial modulus of the silicon substrate, $M_s$:\n$$\nM_s = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s} = \\frac{130 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{1 - 0.28} = \\frac{130 \\times 10^9}{0.72}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} \\approx 1.80556 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nNext, we substitute all values into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{int}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} = \\left(\\frac{130 \\times 10^9}{1 - 0.28}\\right) \\frac{(725 \\times 10^{-6})^2}{6 \\times (300 \\times 10^{-9})} (1.328 \\times 10^{-2})\n$$\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n$$\nt_s^2 = (725 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 = 5.25625 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\n$$\n6 t_f = 6 \\times (300 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 1.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the main equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} = (1.80556 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\times \\frac{5.25625 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2}{1.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\times (1.328 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} = (1.80556 \\times 10^{11}) \\times (0.292014) \\times (1.328 \\times 10^{-2})\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} \\approx 6.9997 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in gigapascals (GPa). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{GPa} = 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} \\approx 0.69997\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{int}} \\approx 0.700\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n$$\nThe positive sign of the stress indicates that it is tensile, which is consistent with the given positive (convex) curvature. This value represents the stress generated intrinsically during the growth of the silicon nitride film at $800\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.",
