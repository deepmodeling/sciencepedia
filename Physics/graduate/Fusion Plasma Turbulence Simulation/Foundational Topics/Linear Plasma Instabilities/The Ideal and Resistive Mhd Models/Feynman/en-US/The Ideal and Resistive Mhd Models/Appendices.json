The governing equations are the standard, simplified resistive MHD equations. The initial condition, $\\mathbf{B}(x, t=0) = B_0 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, is divergence-free, as required by $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, since $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\partial_z (B_0 \\sin(k x)) = 0$. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary equations, initial conditions, and simplifying assumptions provided. The setup is consistent and leads to a well-posed initial value problem for a partial differential equation. All terms are clearly defined and objective. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the equation governing the time evolution of the magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}$, and then solve it for the given initial condition.\n\nFirst, we derive the magnetic induction equation. We start with the Maxwell-Faraday law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nNext, we substitute for the electric field, $\\mathbf{E}$, using Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J} - \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J} - \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nThe current density, $\\mathbf{J}$, is related to the magnetic field via Ampère's law (in the magnetostatic approximation), $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta_m \\equiv \\eta / \\mu_0$, we obtain the general magnetic induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times (\\eta_m \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a static fluid, $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$, which eliminates the first term on the right-hand side. The electrical resistivity $\\eta$, and thus the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_m$, is a uniform constant scalar. Therefore, $\\eta_m$ can be moved outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta_m \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWe use the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. Applying this to $\\mathbf{B}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta_m(\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nFrom Maxwell's equations (or as a standalone law of magnetostatics), the magnetic field is always divergence-free, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. This simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\eta_m \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is the magnetic diffusion equation, which governs the evolution of the magnetic field in a static, uniformly resistive medium.\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the given initial condition $\\mathbf{B}(x, t=0) = B_0 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The magnetic field has only a $z$-component, $\\mathbf{B} = B_z(x, t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and it depends only on the spatial coordinate $x$ and time $t$. The Laplacian operator simplifies accordingly:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) (B_z(x, t) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{\\partial^2 B_z}{\\partial x^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nsince derivatives with respect to $y$ and $z$ are zero. The vector PDE reduces to a scalar PDE for the component $B_z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial t} = \\eta_m \\frac{\\partial^2 B_z}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional diffusion (or heat) equation. We seek a solution of the form $B_z(x, t) = A(t) F(x)$ that satisfies the initial condition $B_z(x, 0) = B_0 \\sin(k x)$. This suggests a spatial dependence of $F(x) = \\sin(k x)$. Let's assume a solution of the form:\n$$\nB_z(x, t) = A(t) \\sin(k x)\n$$\nSubstituting this ansatz into the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [A(t) \\sin(k x)] = \\eta_m \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [A(t) \\sin(k x)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\sin(k x) = \\eta_m A(t) \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}[\\sin(k x)]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\sin(k x) = \\eta_m A(t) [-k^2 \\sin(k x)]\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we can divide by $\\sin(k x)$, which yields an ordinary differential equation for the time-dependent amplitude $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - \\eta_m k^2 A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the general solution:\n$$\nA(t) = C \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. We determine $C$ from the initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$\nB_z(x, 0) = A(0) \\sin(k x) = B_0 \\sin(k x)\n$$\nThis implies that $A(0) = B_0$. From our solution for $A(t)$, we have $A(0) = C \\exp(0) = C$. Thus, $C=B_0$. The time-dependent amplitude is:\n$$\nA(t) = B_0 \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)\n$$\nThe complete solution for the magnetic field evolution is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}(x, t) = B_0 \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t) \\sin(k x) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the decay rate $\\gamma$ such that the magnetic field amplitude decays as $\\exp(-\\gamma t)$. From our solution, the amplitude of the magnetic field, which is the prefactor to the spatial part, is $B_0 \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)$. By comparing this with the form $B_0 \\exp(-\\gamma t)$, we can directly identify the decay rate $\\gamma$.\n$$\n\\exp(-\\gamma t) = \\exp(-\\eta_m k^2 t)\n$$\nTherefore, the decay rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\eta_m k^2\n$$\nThe units of magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_m$ are $\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the units of wavenumber $k$ are $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The units of $\\gamma$ are therefore $(\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{m}^{-1})^2 = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as requested.",

All provided parameters are within physically plausible ranges for a tokamak plasma, and the question pertains to a standard and important topic within magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The problem is valid.\n\nThe central task is to compute the Lundquist number $S$ and interpret its value. The Lundquist number is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the ratio of the resistive magnetic diffusion time, $\\tau_R$, to the Alfvén crossing time, $\\tau_A$. It is defined as:\n$$S = \\frac{\\tau_R}{\\tau_A}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the Alfvén crossing time, $\\tau_A$. This is the time it takes for an Alfvén wave to travel across the characteristic length scale of the system, $L$. The formula is:\n$$\\tau_A = \\frac{L}{v_A}$$\nwhere $v_A$ is the Alfvén speed. The Alfvén speed in a single-fluid MHD model is given by:\n$$v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnetic field strength, $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, and $\\rho$ is the plasma mass density.\nSubstituting the given values: $B = 3\\,\\text{T}$, $\\rho = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$, $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{N/A}^2$, and $L = 0.5\\,\\text{m}$.\nFirst, we calculate the Alfvén speed:\n$$v_A = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (10^{-6})}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{4\\pi \\times 10^{-13}}} \\approx 2.676 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{m/s}$$\nThen, we calculate the Alfvén crossing time:\n$$\\tau_A = \\frac{0.5\\,\\text{m}}{2.676 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{m/s}} \\approx 1.868 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nNext, we determine the resistive magnetic diffusion time, $\\tau_R$. This is the characteristic time scale on which magnetic fields diffuse through a resistive plasma over the length scale $L$. It is given by:\n$$\\tau_R = \\frac{\\mu_0 L^2}{\\eta}$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the plasma's electrical resistivity. The problem specifies the use of the classical Spitzer resistivity for a fully ionized plasma with effective charge $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$. The standard formula for parallel Spitzer resistivity is:\n$$\\eta \\approx 5.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ln \\Lambda}{T_e^{3/2}}$$\nwhere the electron temperature $T_e$ must be in units of electron-volts (eV), $\\ln \\Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm, and the resulting resistivity $\\eta$ is in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}$.\nThe given parameters are $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1$, $\\ln \\Lambda = 17$, and $T_e = 2\\,\\text{keV}$. We must convert the temperature to eV:\n$$T_e = 2\\,\\text{keV} = 2 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{eV}$$\nNow, we can calculate the resistivity:\n$$\\eta \\approx 5.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\frac{(1)(17)}{(2 \\times 10^3)^{3/2}} = \\frac{8.84 \\times 10^{-4}}{(2000)^{1.5}} \\approx \\frac{8.84 \\times 10^{-4}}{89442.7} \\approx 9.883 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}$$\nWith the resistivity calculated, we find the resistive diffusion time:\n$$\\tau_R = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{N/A}^2) (0.5\\,\\text{m})^2}{9.883 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (0.25)}{9.883 \\times 10^{-9}}\\,\\text{s} \\approx 31.78\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the Lundquist number $S$ by taking the ratio of the two time scales:\n$$S = \\frac{\\tau_R}{\\tau_A} \\approx \\frac{31.78\\,\\text{s}}{1.868 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{s}} \\approx 1.701 \\times 10^8$$\nA more direct calculation of $S$ can be performed using the combined expression, which avoids intermediate rounding:\n$$S = \\frac{\\mu_0 L v_A}{\\eta} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (0.5) (2.676 \\times 10^6)}{9.883 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 1.701 \\times 10^8$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$S \\approx 1.70 \\times 10^8$$\n\nFor the qualitative interpretation, we compare our calculated Lundquist number to the critical value for the onset of the plasmoid instability in a reconnection layer, given as $S_c \\approx 10^4$.\nWe find that our calculated value, $S \\approx 1.70 \\times 10^8$, is vastly larger than the critical value:\n$$S \\gg S_c$$\nThis has profound implications for the nature of magnetic reconnection. The classical steady-state model of reconnection (Sweet-Parker model) predicts a very slow reconnection rate for such high $S$ values. However, the condition $S > S_c$ indicates that the thin current sheet, which is central to the reconnection process, is unstable to a tearing-type instability. This instability breaks the monolithic current sheet into a chain of smaller magnetic islands, or \"plasmoids\". The formation, growth, and violent ejection of these plasmoids disrupt the simple Sweet-Parker layer, leading to a reconnection process that is much faster, bursty, and chaotic. This \"plasmoid-unstable\" regime is believed to be the dominant mode of fast reconnection in many high-$S$ systems, including tokamak plasmas and solar flares. Therefore, for the given tokamak-relevant parameters, one should expect a fast, plasmoid-mediated reconnection regime rather than slow, steady Sweet-Parker reconnection.",

The tests must cover (1) nonlinear ideal dynamics, (2) linear waves with dissipation, and (3) pure resistive diffusion.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\n1.  **Orszag–Tang (O-T) Vortex in $2$D Ideal MHD:** This is a classic, canonical problem for testing compressible MHD codes. It evolves from smooth initial conditions to a complex state with shocks and current sheets, rigorously testing the nonlinear and shock-capturing aspects of a solver. This matches requirement (1).\n    -   *Verification Metric 1: Constancy of total energy.* In ideal MHD, the total energy $E_{tot} = \\int (\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0} + \\frac{p}{\\gamma-1}) dV$ is a conserved quantity. Verifying that it remains constant (within numerical error) is a fundamental test of the scheme's conservation properties. **Correct.**\n    -   *Verification Metric 2: Small $L_2$ norm of $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$.* The solenoidal constraint, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, is a primary law of MHD. While not all numerical schemes enforce this exactly, a good solver must keep the numerical divergence small. Monitoring the norm of $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$ is a standard and crucial verification step. **Correct.**\n    -   *Verification Metric 3: Agreement of shock/current-sheet morphology.* For complex nonlinear problems without analytic solutions, comparing the results (e.g., shock locations, feature morphology) against a well-established high-resolution benchmark simulation is a standard verification technique (code-to-code comparison). **Correct.**\n\n2.  **Decaying Shear Alfvén Waves:** This is a canonical problem for testing linear wave propagation and the implementation of dissipative terms, matching requirement (2). An initial linear wave is imposed on a uniform magnetized plasma.\n    -   *Verification Metric 1: Phase speed equals the Alfvén speed.* Linear shear Alfvén waves in a uniform plasma with magnetic field $B_0$ and density $\\rho_0$ propagate along the background field at the Alfvén speed, $v_A = B_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho_0}$. Small dissipation does not significantly alter the real part of the frequency for long wavelengths. This is a direct consequence of linear MHD theory. **Correct.**\n    -   *Verification Metric 2: Exponential amplitude decay at the predicted rate.* In resistive-viscous MHD, a linear wave mode with wavenumber $k$ experiences damping. For a shear Alfvén wave, the damping rate is $\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2}(\\eta + \\nu) k^2$, where $\\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. Verifying that the wave amplitude decays as $e^{-\\Gamma t}$ is a precise, quantitative test of the solver's implementation of these dissipative terms. **Correct.**\n\n3.  **Resistive Diffusion of a Magnetic Slab:** This test isolates the resistive part of the MHD equations in the absence of flow ($\\mathbf{v}=0$), matching requirement (3). The governing equation simplifies to the magnetic diffusion equation, $\\partial_t \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$, where $\\eta$ is uniform.\n    -   *Verification Metric 1: Error-function broadening with width growing like $\\sqrt{t}$.* This is the exact analytic solution to the $1$D diffusion equation for a step-function-like initial condition. A key feature of diffusion is the characteristic length scale $L$ growing as $L \\sim \\sqrt{\\eta t}$. This is a perfect quantitative verification. **Correct.**\n    -   *Verification Metric 2: Conservation of total magnetic flux.* For the magnetic diffusion equation on a periodic domain, the volume-averaged magnetic field, $\\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V}\\int_V \\mathbf{B} dV$, is conserved. This follows from $\\partial_t \\langle \\mathbf{B} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_V \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} dV = \\frac{\\eta}{V} \\oint_{\\partial V} \\nabla \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0$ for periodic boundaries. The total flux is proportional to this average. This is a check on a fundamental conservation law. **Correct.**\n    -   *Verification Metric 3: Normed errors decreasing under grid refinement.* This is the definition of a convergence study, which is the cornerstone of numerical verification. Any valid verification suite must include this. **Correct.**\n\n**Conclusion on Option A:** All three proposed tests are canonical, scientifically correct, and directly address the stated requirements. The verification metrics are quantitative and derived from fundamental MHD principles. This option is a stringently designed verification suite. **Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n-   **Test 2: Decaying fast magnetosonic waves:** The proposal is to compare the measured phase speed to the Alfvén speed. This is incorrect. The phase speed of a fast magnetosonic wave depends on the sound speed $c_s$ and the Alfvén speed $v_A$ in a complex manner, and is always greater than or equal to $v_A$. Furthermore, the damping rate of a fast wave is physically different from that of a shear Alfvén wave, as it involves compression. Using the wrong theoretical prediction for verification is invalid. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Test 3: Resistive diffusion of a magnetic slab:** The proposal is to verify exponential decay of the *net* magnetic flux. As established previously, the net (or volume-averaged) magnetic flux is a conserved quantity in a periodic domain. It does not decay. Additionally, a non-sinusoidal \"slab\" profile is composed of multiple Fourier modes and will not decay with a single exponential rate. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion on Option B:** This option contains multiple fundamental scientific errors regarding wave properties and conservation laws in MHD. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n-   **Test 1: Orszag–Tang vortex in ideal MHD:** The proposal is to verify \"monotonic decay of the total energy due to shock heating.\" This is a fundamental conceptual error. In the exact theory of ideal MHD, total energy is strictly conserved. Shocks convert kinetic to internal energy, but their sum is constant. A numerical scheme should be verified by how well it *conserves* this energy, not by measuring a decay that constitutes numerical error. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Test 3: Resistive diffusion with spatially varying magnetic diffusivity:** The problem statement specifies that the solver supports *uniform* transport coefficients. Proposing a test that requires a spatially varying coefficient is inconsistent with the problem's constraints. Furthermore, advocating for verification via \"visual resemblance\" and \"qualitative error bars\" rejects the quantitative rigor required for a \"stringent verification suite.\" **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion on Option C:** This option contains a fundamental misconception about energy conservation in ideal MHD and proposes a test that is both inconsistent with the solver's capabilities and methodologically weak. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n-   **Test 1 & 2: Hall-MHD phenomena (O-T vortex, whistler waves):** The problem is to verify an *ideal and resistive MHD* solver. Hall-MHD is a more complex model that includes two-fluid effects via the Hall term in Ohm's law. Whistler waves are a feature of Hall-MHD, not standard MHD. Testing a standard MHD code with phenomena it is not designed to model is illogical. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Test 3: Resistive diffusion with line-tied boundaries:** The problem statement specifies the solver supports *periodic domains*. Line-tied boundaries are a physically and numerically distinct boundary condition. This test is incompatible with the stated capabilities of the solver. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion on Option D:** This option proposes tests for a different physical model (Hall-MHD) and for different boundary conditions (line-tied) than those specified for the solver in question. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that proposes a scientifically sound, canonical, and internally consistent verification suite that matches all the requirements and constraints given in the problem statement.",
