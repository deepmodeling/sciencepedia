            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated and found to be valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in plasma kinetic theory. Initially, the requirement to provide a numerical answer in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ without supplying numerical values for plasma parameters ($n_e$, $\\Delta$) or wave parameters ($k$) suggests the problem is underspecified. However, a full derivation reveals that the Landau damping rate for the specified waterbag distribution is exactly zero, a result that is independent of any specific parameter values. Thus, the problem is self-contained and solvable as stated.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the dispersion relation and the computation of the Landau damping rate for electron plasma waves in an unmagnetized plasma with a waterbag equilibrium distribution function.\n\nThe starting points are the linearized Vlasov and Poisson equations for electrons. The ion background is fixed and neutralizing.\nThe Vlasov equation for the perturbed electron distribution function, $f_1(x, v, t)$, linearized around the equilibrium $f_0(v)$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} - \\frac{e E_1}{m_{e}} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v} = 0\n$$\nwhere $E_1(x,t)$ is the perturbed electric field, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $m_e$ is the electron mass. We assume perturbations of the form $\\exp(i k x - i \\omega t)$, where $k$ is the real wavenumber and $\\omega = \\omega_r + i\\gamma$ is the complex frequency. Substituting this form into the linearized Vlasov equation gives:\n$$\n-i\\omega f_1 + ikv f_1 - \\frac{e E_1}{m_{e}} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v} = 0\n$$\nSolving for the perturbed distribution function $f_1$ yields:\n$$\nf_1(v) = \\frac{e E_1}{m_{e}} \\frac{1}{i(kv - \\omega)} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v} = -i \\frac{e E_1}{m_{e}} \\frac{1}{\\omega - kv} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v}\n$$\nNext, we use Poisson's equation. The problem statement gives $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} = \\frac{e}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\left(n_{i} - n_{e} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f\\, dv\\right)$. The total distribution is $f = f_0 + f_1$. The ion density $n_i$ is constant and equal to the equilibrium electron density $n_e$ for neutrality. The perturbed electron density is $n_{e1} = n_e \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(v) dv$.\nThe linearized Poisson equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{e n_e}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(v) dv\n$$\nApplying the plane wave form $E_1 \\propto \\exp(ikx - i\\omega t)$, this becomes:\n$$\nik E_1 = -\\frac{e n_e}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_1(v) dv\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial wave mode ($E_1 \\neq 0$), we substitute the expression for $f_1(v)$:\n$$\nik E_1 = -\\frac{e n_e}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( -i \\frac{e E_1}{m_{e}} \\frac{1}{\\omega - kv} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v} \\right) dv\n$$\nCanceling the common factor $i E_1$ from both sides gives:\n$$\nk = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\omega - kv} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v} dv\n$$\nThe integral over velocity must be interpreted using the Landau contour prescription. For an initially growing wave, $\\Im(\\omega)  0$, the pole at $v = \\omega/k$ is in the upper half of the complex velocity plane, and the integration path along the real velocity axis is well-defined. The result is then analytically continued to the entire complex $\\omega$-plane.\nRearranging the equation yields the general dispersion relation for electrostatic waves:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k} \\int_{L} \\frac{1}{\\omega - kv} \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v} dv = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\int_{L} \\frac{f_0'(v)}{v - \\omega/k} dv\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}$ is the square of the electron plasma frequency, and $f_0'(v) = \\frac{d f_{0}}{d v}$. The standard form of the dielectric function is $\\epsilon(\\omega, k) = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\int_{L} \\frac{f_0'(v)}{v - \\omega/k} dv$. The dispersion relation is given by $\\epsilon(\\omega, k) = 0$. Using the electron charge $q=-e$, the Vlasov equation contains a term $+\\frac{e}{m_e}E_1 \\frac{df_0}{dv}$, which leads to the dielectric function $1 + \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\int_L \\frac{f_0'(v)}{v - \\omega/k} dv = 0$.\n\nNow we apply this to the specific waterbag distribution:\n$$\nf_{0}(v) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2 \\Delta},  |v| \\le \\Delta, \\\\\n0,  |v|  \\Delta.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe derivative of this function is given in terms of Dirac delta functions:\n$$\nf_0'(v) = \\frac{d}{dv} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} [H(v+\\Delta) - H(v-\\Delta)] \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} [\\delta(v+\\Delta) - \\delta(v-\\Delta)]\n$$\nwhere $H(v)$ is the Heaviside step function.\nWe substitute this derivative into the velocity integral of the dispersion relation. Let $u = \\omega/k$.\n$$\n\\int_L \\frac{f_0'(v)}{v - u} dv = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} \\frac{\\delta(v+\\Delta) - \\delta(v-\\Delta)}{v - u} dv\n$$\nUsing the sifting property of the delta function, $\\int g(x) \\delta(x-a) dx = g(a)$:\n$$\n\\int_L \\frac{f_0'(v)}{v - u} dv = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{1}{-\\Delta - u} - \\frac{1}{\\Delta - u} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\Delta + u} - \\frac{1}{\\Delta - u} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} \\frac{-(\\Delta - u) - (\\Delta + u)}{(\\Delta+u)(\\Delta-u)} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta} \\frac{-2\\Delta}{\\Delta^2 - u^2} = \\frac{1}{u^2 - \\Delta^2}\n$$\nThis result is valid for any complex $u$ as long as $u \\neq \\pm \\Delta$. The integral is an analytic function of $u$ except for simple poles at $u=\\pm \\Delta$. The Landau contour prescription is trivially satisfied as there are no singularities of the integrand on the real axis unless $u$ is real and equals $\\pm \\Delta$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the dispersion relation $1 + \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\int \\frac{f_0'}{v - \\omega/k}dv = 0$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{(\\omega/k)^2 - \\Delta^2} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2} \\frac{1}{\\omega^2/k^2 - \\Delta^2} = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2 - k^2\\Delta^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$:\n$$\n\\omega^2 - k^2\\Delta^2 = -\\omega_p^2\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^2 = k^2\\Delta^2 - \\omega_p^2\n$$\nThe complex frequency $\\omega$ is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\omega = \\pm \\sqrt{k^2\\Delta^2 - \\omega_p^2}\n$$\nFor waves to propagate, we need $\\omega^2 > 0$, so $k^2\\Delta^2 > \\omega_p^2$. In this case, the frequency $\\omega$ is purely real. If $k^2\\Delta^2  \\omega_p^2$, then $\\omega$ is purely imaginary, representing a purely growing or decaying (non-oscillatory) mode, not Landau damping of a propagating wave. The damping rate for a propagating wave, $\\gamma = \\Im(\\omega)$, is defined for the case where $\\omega_r \\neq 0$.\nIn our result, $\\omega$ is always either purely real or purely imaginary. In either case, for a propagating wave, the imaginary part of the frequency is zero.\n$$\n\\gamma = 0\n$$\nThus, the electron plasma waves in a plasma with a waterbag distribution are undamped. The result is $0 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe absence of damping can be explained by analyzing the resonance condition and the structure of $f_0'(v)$. Landau damping arises from the net exchange of energy between the wave and particles moving at or near the wave's phase velocity, $v_{ph} = \\Re(\\omega)/k = \\omega_r/k$. The rate of this energy exchange is proportional to the slope of the distribution function at the phase velocity, $f_0'(v_{ph})$.\n\nFor the waterbag distribution, for a propagating wave, the phase velocity is:\n$$\n|v_{ph}| = \\frac{|\\omega_r|}{k} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k^2\\Delta^2 - \\omega_p^2}}{k} = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}}\n$$\nSince $\\omega_p^2/k^2 > 0$, it is clear that $|v_{ph}|  \\Delta$.\nThe waterbag distribution has a flat top, meaning the slope $f_0'(v)$ is zero for all velocities $|v|  \\Delta$. Since the wave's phase velocity $|v_{ph}|$ falls within this range, the slope at the resonant velocity is exactly zero: $f_0'(v_{ph})=0$. Therefore, there is no net energy exchange between the wave and the resonant particles. This is the physical reason for the absence of Landau damping.\n\nIn contrast, for a Maxwellian equilibrium distribution, $f_M(v) \\propto \\exp(-v^2/v_{th}^2)$, the function and its derivative are non-zero for all velocities. A Maxwellian distribution has \"exponential tails\", meaning there is a small but finite population of particles at any velocity, no matter how high. When an electron plasma wave propagates, its phase velocity $v_{ph}$ is typically greater than the thermal velocity $v_{th}$, but because of the tails, there are always particles with $v \\approx v_{ph}$. The derivative $f_M'(v_{ph})$ is non-zero (and negative for $v_{ph} > 0$), leading to a net transfer of energy from the wave to the particles, and thus wave damping.\n\nMathematically, the difference lies in the analytic properties of the velocity integral.\nFor the waterbag, the compact support and piecewise constant nature of $f_0(v)$ leads to a dispersion relation that is a simple algebraic (rational) function of $\\omega^2$. The solutions for $\\omega$ are the roots of this algebraic equation, which turn out to be purely real or imaginary.\nFor the Maxwellian, the infinite support of $f_0(v)$ leads to a dispersion function involving the transcendental plasma dispersion function, $Z(\\zeta)$, where $\\zeta = \\omega/(k v_{th}\\sqrt{2})$. This function is complex for real arguments, which fundamentally introduces an imaginary part to the frequency $\\omega$ for any real $k$. This mathematical feature reflects the physical presence of a continuum of resonant particles at all velocities. The absence of a velocity gradient within the waterbag distribution effectively eliminates the mathematical structure that gives rise to Landau damping.",

There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe stability of the plasma is governed by the Penrose criterion, which is derived from the linear Vlasov-Poisson dispersion relation. The criterion states that an instability exists (i.e., there is a solution to the dispersion relation with $\\text{Im}(\\omega)  0$ for some real wavenumber $k$) if and only if the distribution function $f_0(v)$ has a local minimum at some velocity $v=v_m$ such that the Penrose integral is positive:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f_0'(v)}{v - v_m} dv  0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Cauchy principal value. A simpler, sufficient condition for instability is the mere existence of a local minimum in the velocity distribution function $f_0(v)$. For the symmetric two-stream distribution, this condition is found to be both necessary and sufficient.\n\nWe will therefore find the condition under which the given distribution function $f_0(v)$ develops a local minimum.\nThe distribution function is:\n$$\nf_{0}(v) = C \\left[ \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v - U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v + U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{n_{e}}{2 \\sqrt{\\pi} v_{th}}$ is a positive constant.\n\nThis function is symmetric with respect to $v=0$, i.e., $f_0(v) = f_0(-v)$. An extremum will occur where the first derivative is zero, $\\frac{df_0}{dv} = 0$.\nThe first derivative of $f_0(v)$ with respect to $v$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{df_0}{dv} = C \\left[ \\left( -\\frac{2(v - U)}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v - U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + \\left( -\\frac{2(v + U)}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v + U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{df_0}{dv} = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\left[ (v - U) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v - U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + (v + U) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v + U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nWe test for an extremum at $v=0$. Evaluating the derivative at $v=0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{df_0}{dv} \\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\left[ (-U) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(-U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + (U) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{U^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} [ -U + U ] \\exp\\left( - \\frac{U^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, $v=0$ is always an extremum of the distribution function. To determine whether it is a local minimum or a local maximum, we must examine the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2}$, at $v=0$. A positive sign indicates a local minimum (instability), while a negative sign indicates a local maximum (stability). The transition between stability and instability occurs at the critical point where the extremum becomes a flat inflection point, i.e., $\\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2}|_{v=0} = 0$.\n\nWe compute the second derivative of $f_0(v)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\frac{d}{dv} \\left[ (v - U) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v - U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + (v + U) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v + U)^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule, the derivative of a term like $(v-a) \\exp(-(v-a)^2/b^2)$ is $\\left[1 - \\frac{2(v-a)^2}{b^2}\\right] \\exp(-(v-a)^2/b^2)$. Applying this, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{2(v - U)^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v - U)^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{2(v + U)^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(v + U)^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the extremum $v=0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} \\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{2(-U)^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{(-U)^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{2(U)^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{U^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} \\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{2C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\left[ 2 \\left(1 - \\frac{2U^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\exp\\left( - \\frac{U^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} \\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{4C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{U^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{2U^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right)\n$$\nAn instability exists if $v=0$ is a local minimum, which requires $\\left. \\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} \\right|_{v=0}  0$. The factor $-\\frac{4C}{v_{th}^{2}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{U^2}{v_{th}^{2}} \\right)$ is always negative. Therefore, the condition for instability becomes:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{2U^2}{v_{th}^2}  0 \\implies 1  \\frac{2U^2}{v_{th}^2} \\implies U^2  \\frac{v_{th}^2}{2} \\implies U  \\frac{v_{th}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nConversely, the system is stable if $v=0$ is a local maximum, which requires $\\left. \\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} \\right|_{v=0}  0$. This leads to:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{2U^2}{v_{th}^2}  0 \\implies U  \\frac{v_{th}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe critical threshold $U_c$ that separates the stable and unstable regimes is the value of $U$ for which the second derivative is zero. This marks the transition from a single-peaked distribution (stable) to a double-peaked distribution with a minimum at $v=0$ (unstable).\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2f_0}{dv^2} \\right|_{v=0} = 0 \\implies 1 - \\frac{2U_c^2}{v_{th}^2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $U_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{2U_c^2}{v_{th}^2} = 1 \\implies U_c^2 = \\frac{v_{th}^2}{2}\n$$\nSince $U_c$ is a speed magnitude, it must be non-negative.

For $U  U_c$, the distribution has a local minimum at $v=0$, satisfying the Penrose criterion for instability. For $U \\le U_c$, the distribution has a single maximum at $v=0$ (or a flat top at $U=U_c$), and the system is stable.",

The Landau damping rate normalized to the electron plasma frequency is the dimensionless quantity $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}} = -\\operatorname{Im}(\\hat{\\omega})$, which is unitless.\n\nYour task is to implement a numerical solver that:\n- Represents $Z(\\xi)$ via the Faddeeva function $w(z)$ using the identity $Z(\\xi) = i \\sqrt{\\pi}\\, w(\\xi)$, where $w(z) = e^{-z^{2}} \\operatorname{erfc}(-i z)$.\n- Solves for the complex root $\\hat{\\omega}$ of the normalized dielectric function\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\hat{\\omega}, \\hat{k}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\hat{k}^{2}} \\left[ 1 + \\hat{\\xi}\\, Z(\\hat{\\xi}) \\right] = 0, \\quad \\hat{\\xi} = \\frac{\\hat{\\omega}}{\\hat{k}},\n$$\nusing a two-dimensional nonlinear root-finding method on the real and imaginary parts of $\\varepsilon$.\n- Computes and returns $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}} = -\\operatorname{Im}(\\hat{\\omega})$.\n\nIn addition, quantify the sensitivity of $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ to numerical errors in $Z(\\xi)$ by introducing a controlled multiplicative perturbation of the form $Z_{\\epsilon}(\\xi) = (1 + \\epsilon)\\, Z(\\xi)$ and recomputing the damping rate for several values of $\\epsilon$. This models a relative numerical error in the evaluation of $Z(\\xi)$.\n\nImplement your program to evaluate and output the following test suite:\n- Case 1 (happy path): $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.2$, $\\epsilon = 0.0$.\n- Case 2 (near machine precision perturbation): $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.2$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-8}$.\n- Case 3 (small perturbation): $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.2$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-5}$.\n- Case 4 (moderate perturbation): $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.2$, $\\epsilon = 10^{-3}$.\n- Case 5 (boundary in $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$): $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.05$, $\\epsilon = 0.0$.\n- Case 6 (edge in $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$): $k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = 0.5$, $\\epsilon = 0.0$.\n\nUse the normalization $\\hat{k} = \\sqrt{2}\\,k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and return the numerical values of $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ for each case. No physical units are required because the output is dimensionless.\n\nFinal output format requirement: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, \"[result1,result2,result3]\"). Each result must be a single floating-point number $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ corresponding to the cases listed above, ordered as given.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the numerical computation of the Landau damping rate of electron plasma waves in an unmagnetized, collisionless plasma with a Maxwellian electron distribution. The solution involves finding the complex roots of the electrostatic dielectric function. This will be accomplished by implementing a numerical root-finding algorithm. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis will be performed to quantify the effect of numerical errors in the plasma dispersion function on the calculated damping rate.\n\nThe fundamental equation to be solved is the dispersion relation, given by $\\varepsilon(\\omega, k) = 0$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the dielectric function. For the specified plasma conditions, the normalized form of this equation is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\hat{\\omega}, \\hat{k}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\hat{k}^{2}} \\left[ 1 + \\hat{\\xi}\\, Z(\\hat{\\xi}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\hat{\\omega} = \\omega/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ is the complex wave frequency normalized to the electron plasma frequency, $\\hat{k} = k v_{\\mathrm{th}}/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ is the wavenumber normalized using the electron thermal speed $v_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and $\\hat{\\xi} = \\hat{\\omega}/\\hat{k}$ is their ratio. The function $Z(\\hat{\\xi})$ is the plasma dispersion function. The damping rate is given by the negative of the imaginary part of the frequency root, $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}} = -\\operatorname{Im}(\\hat{\\omega})$. The problem also specifies the normalization relationship $\\hat{k} = \\sqrt{2}\\,k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the electron Debye length.\n\nThe task is to find the complex root $\\hat{\\omega} = \\hat{\\omega}_r + i \\hat{\\omega}_i$ for given values of $\\hat{k}$. This is equivalent to solving a system of two coupled, nonlinear real equations for two real variables, $\\hat{\\omega}_r$ and $\\hat{\\omega}_i$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}\\left[ \\varepsilon(\\hat{\\omega}_r + i\\hat{\\omega}_i, \\hat{k}) \\right] = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Im}\\left[ \\varepsilon(\\hat{\\omega}_r + i\\hat{\\omega}_i, \\hat{k}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nTo evaluate the dielectric function, we must compute the plasma dispersion function $Z(\\xi)$. The problem provides the relation $Z(\\xi) = i \\sqrt{\\pi}\\, w(\\xi)$, where $w(\\xi) = e^{-\\xi^{2}} \\operatorname{erfc}(-i \\xi)$ is the Faddeeva function. A robust numerical implementation of $w(\\xi)$ is available in the SciPy library as `scipy.special.wofz`.\n\nA numerical root-finding algorithm is required to solve this system. The `scipy.optimize.root` function is well-suited for this purpose. It requires an initial guess for the solution vector $(\\hat{\\omega}_r, \\hat{\\omega}_i)$. A physically motivated initial guess significantly improves the likelihood of convergence to the correct root (the forward-propagating, damped Langmuir wave). In the long-wavelength limit ($k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} \\ll 1$), the real part of the frequency is well-approximated by the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation, $\\omega^2 \\approx \\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{\\text{th,rms}}^2$. Using the problem's definition $v_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{2} v_{\\text{th,rms}}$, this becomes $\\omega^2 \\approx \\omega_{pe}^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k^2 v_{\\mathrm{th}}^2$. In normalized units, this provides an excellent initial guess for the real part:\n$$\n\\hat{\\omega}_r \\approx \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3}{2} \\hat{k}^2}\n$$\nFor the imaginary part, Landau damping is known to be weak for small $\\hat{k}$, implying $\\hat{\\omega}_i$ is a small negative number. A reasonable initial guess such as $\\hat{\\omega}_i = -0.01$ is sufficient to guide the solver towards the damped root ($\\operatorname{Im}(\\omega)  0$).\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is conducted by introducing a controlled multiplicative perturbation $\\epsilon$ into the plasma dispersion function, defining a perturbed function $Z_{\\epsilon}(\\xi) = (1 + \\epsilon)\\, Z(\\xi)$. The dispersion relation is then re-solved using this perturbed function:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{1}{\\hat{k}^{2}} \\left[ 1 + \\hat{\\xi}\\, (1 + \\epsilon)Z(\\hat{\\xi}) \\right] = 0\n$$\nBy solving for $\\hat{\\omega}$ for various small values of $\\epsilon$, we can observe the resulting change in the damping rate, $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}}$.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  For each test case defined by $(k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}, \\epsilon)$:\n2.  Calculate the normalized wavenumber $\\hat{k} = \\sqrt{2}\\,k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$.\n3.  Establish an initial guess for the root $(\\hat{\\omega}_r, \\hat{\\omega}_i)$ using the Bohm-Gross relation and a small negative imaginary part.\n4.  Define a target function that takes a vector $(\\hat{\\omega}_r, \\hat{\\omega}_i)$ and returns the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\hat{\\omega}, \\hat{k})$, incorporating the perturbation $\\epsilon$.\n5.  Invoke the `scipy.optimize.root` solver to find the root $(\\hat{\\omega}_{r, \\text{sol}}, \\hat{\\omega}_{i, \\text{sol}})$.\n6.  The Landau damping rate is then $\\gamma/\\omega_{\\mathrm{pe}} = -\\hat{\\omega}_{i, \\text{sol}}$.\n7.  Collect the results from all test cases and format them into the specified output string.
