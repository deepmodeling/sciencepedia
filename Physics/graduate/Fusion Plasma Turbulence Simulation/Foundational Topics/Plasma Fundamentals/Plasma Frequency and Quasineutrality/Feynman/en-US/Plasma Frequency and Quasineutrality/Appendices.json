We assume plane-wave perturbations of the form $f_1 \\propto e^{i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t)}$, where subscript $1$ denotes a first-order perturbed quantity. Under this assumption, the differential operators become algebraic: $\\partial_t \\rightarrow -i\\omega$ and $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nThe provided equations are already linearized for small perturbations around a zero-velocity, uniform-density equilibrium ($n_{s0}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{s0}=0$, $\\mathbf{E}_0=0$).\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** For a species $s$ with mass $m_s$ and charge $q_s$, the perturbed velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{s1}$ is related to the perturbed electric field $\\mathbf{E}_1$:\n    $$m_s (-i\\omega) \\mathbf{v}_{s1} = q_s \\mathbf{E}_1 \\implies \\mathbf{v}_{s1} = \\frac{i q_s}{\\omega m_s} \\mathbf{E}_1$$\n\n2.  **Continuity Equation:** The perturbed density $n_{s1}$ is related to the perturbed velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{s1}$:\n    $$(-i\\omega) n_{s1} + n_{s0} (i\\mathbf{k}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{s1} = 0 \\implies \\omega n_{s1} = n_{s0} (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{s1})$$\n    Substitute the expression for $\\mathbf{v}_{s1}$ from the momentum equation:\n    $$\\omega n_{s1} = n_{s0} \\left( \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\frac{i q_s}{\\omega m_s} \\mathbf{E}_1 \\right) = \\frac{i q_s n_{s0}}{\\omega m_s} (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1)$$\n    Solving for $n_{s1}$:\n    $$n_{s1} = \\frac{i q_s n_{s0}}{\\omega^2 m_s} (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1)$$\n\n3.  **Gauss's Law:** The perturbed electric field is related to the perturbed charge density $\\rho_1 = \\sum_s q_s n_{s1}$:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\epsilon_0} \\implies (i\\mathbf{k}) \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\sum_s q_s n_{s1}$$\n    Substitute the expression for $n_{s1}$:\n    $$i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\sum_s q_s \\left( \\frac{i q_s n_{s0}}{\\omega^2 m_s} (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1) \\right)$$\n    $$i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1) = \\frac{i (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1)}{\\epsilon_0 \\omega^2} \\sum_s \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{m_s}$$\n    For a non-trivial solution ($\\mathbf{E}_1 \\neq 0$) and longitudinal waves ($\\mathbf{k} \\parallel \\mathbf{E}_1$, so $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1 \\neq 0$), we can cancel the $i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1)$ term from both sides, yielding the dispersion relation:\n    $$1 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 \\omega^2} \\sum_s \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{m_s}$$\n    Rearranging gives:\n    $$\\omega^2 = \\sum_s \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_s}$$\n    This shows that the total oscillation frequency squared is the sum of the squared plasma frequencies of each species, where the plasma frequency for species $s$ is defined as:\n    $$\\omega_{ps}^2 = \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_s}$$\n\n**Expression for Ion Plasma Frequency ($\\omega_{pi}$)**\nFor ions ($s=i$), we have charge $q_i = Ze$ and equilibrium density $n_{i0}$ (written as $n_i$ in the problem).\n$$\\omega_{pi}^2 = \\frac{n_i (Ze)^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_i} = \\frac{Z^2 n_i e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_i}$$\nTherefore, the ion plasma frequency is:\n$$\\omega_{pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Z^2 n_i e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_i}}$$\n\n**Ratio of Ion to Electron Plasma Frequency ($\\omega_{pi}/\\omega_{pe}$)**\nFor electrons ($s=e$), we have charge $q_e = -e$ and equilibrium density $n_{e0}$ (written as $n_e$).\n$$\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_e (-e)^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e} = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_e}$$\nThe ratio of the squared frequencies is:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} = \\frac{Z^2 n_i e^2 / (\\epsilon_0 m_i)}{n_e e^2 / (\\epsilon_0 m_e)} = \\frac{Z^2 n_i m_e}{n_e m_i}$$\nUsing the quasineutrality condition $n_e = Z n_i$:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} = \\frac{Z^2 n_i m_e}{(Z n_i) m_i} = \\frac{Z m_e}{m_i}$$\nTaking the square root gives the ratio of the frequencies:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{pi}}{\\omega_{pe}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Z m_e}{m_i}}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation for Deuterium**\nFor deuterium, $Z=1$ and the mass ratio is given as $m_i/m_e \\approx 3670$.\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{pi}}{\\omega_{pe}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1) m_e}{m_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m_i/m_e}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3670}}$$\nSince $\\sqrt{3600} = 60$, we have $\\sqrt{3670} \\approx 60.58$.

This is incorrect. The ion charge squared is $(Ze)^2 = Z^2 e^2$, not $Ze^2$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\omega_{pi} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{Z^2 \\, n_i \\, e^2}{\\epsilon_0 \\, m_i}}$ and, with quasineutrality, $\\dfrac{\\omega_{pi}}{\\omega_{pe}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{n_i}{n_e}} \\approx 1$ for deuterium.**\n-   The expression for $\\omega_{pi}$ is correct.\n-   The expression for the ratio $\\dfrac{\\omega_{pi}}{\\omega_{pe}}$ is $\\sqrt{\\dfrac{n_i}{n_e}}$. This is incorrect. The derivation correctly shows the ratio depends on masses and charge state, not just number densities in this manner. The correct ratio is $\\sqrt{Z m_e / m_i}$.\n-   For deuterium ($Z=1$), quasineutrality gives $n_i=n_e$, making their ratio $\\sqrt{n_i/n_e}=1$. This is grossly incorrect; the ion plasma frequency is much lower than the electron plasma frequency due to the large ion mass.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The given equations are fundamental laws of physics. The parameters provided are realistic for the core of a magnetic confinement fusion device. The assumptions, such as a cold-electron linear response, are standard approximations in this field for deriving the plasma conductivity at frequencies much lower than the electron cyclotron frequency. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data and constants. The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed with Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the magnitude of the displacement current density to the magnitude of the conduction current density. The Ampère–Maxwell law is given as:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the conduction current density, and the displacement current density is $\\mathbf{J}_D = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$. We need to find the ratio $\\frac{|\\mathbf{J}_D|}{|\\mathbf{J}|}$.\n\nLet the electric field be time-harmonic, as specified:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}(t) = \\mathbf{E}_0 \\exp(-i\\omega t) $$\nThe time derivative operator can be replaced by multiplication with $-i\\omega$. The displacement current density is then:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}_D = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega\\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} $$\nThe magnitude of the displacement current density is $|\\mathbf{J}_D| = \\omega \\varepsilon_0 |\\mathbf{E}|$.\n\nNext, we derive the conduction current density $\\mathbf{J}$ from the linearized, collisionless electron momentum equation under the cold-electron assumption:\n$$ m_e \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_e}{\\partial t} = -e \\mathbf{E} $$\nFor a time-harmonic perturbation, this becomes:\n$$ -i\\omega m_e \\mathbf{v}_e = -e \\mathbf{E} $$\nSolving for the electron fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}_e$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_e = \\frac{e \\mathbf{E}}{i\\omega m_e} = -i \\frac{e}{m_e\\omega} \\mathbf{E} $$\nThe conduction current is primarily due to the motion of electrons, as the ions are much more massive and their response at this frequency is negligible in this simple model.

The electron diamagnetic drift frequency is given by $\\omega_{*e} = \\mathbf{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{de}$, where $\\mathbf{v}_{de}$ is the electron diamagnetic drift velocity. In magnitude, this is often approximated as:\n$$ \\omega \\approx |\\omega_{*e}| \\approx k_y v_{de} = k_y \\frac{|\\nabla p_e|}{n_e e B} $$\nAssuming an isothermal plasma with constant temperature, the pressure gradient is $\\nabla p_e = \\nabla(n_e k_B T_e) = k_B T_e \\nabla n_e$. The density gradient scale length $L_n$ is defined by $|\\nabla n_e|/n_e = 1/L_n$. Substituting these gives:\n$$ \\omega \\approx k_y \\frac{k_B T_e (n_e/L_n)}{n_e e B} = \\frac{k_y k_B T_e}{e B L_n} $$\nNote that the given electron temperature $T_e=3.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ is an energy unit. The quantity $k_B T_e$ in the formula is precisely this energy expressed in Joules.

The code enforces a discrete quasineutrality constraint of the form $\\sum_{s} Z_{s}\\,\\delta n_{s} - \\delta n_{e} = 0$ at each time update to determine the electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)$, where $s$ indexes ion species with charge number $Z_{s}$, $\\delta n_{s}$ and $\\delta n_{e}$ are perturbed densities, and $\\mathbf{x}$ and $t$ denote position and time, respectively. However, due to numerical noise (for example, from finite particle sampling or aliasing on the grid), a small but nonzero residual charge density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ may persist, so that the exact constraint is not satisfied pointwise.\n\nUsing only the following foundations: the charge continuity equation $\\partial_{t}\\rho + \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, Gauss’s law $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho/\\epsilon_{0}$, Faraday’s law $\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\partial_{t}\\mathbf{B}$ (so that electrostatic fields satisfy $\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$), and a linearized electron momentum balance along the electric field with immobile ions (so that electron inertia relates $\\partial_{t}\\mathbf{u}_{e}$ to $\\mathbf{E}$), reason qualitatively and quantitatively about the impact of $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ on the fields and fluctuations, and about diagnostics to verify that quasineutrality is being enforced to the fidelity required for ion-scale turbulence.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct about the impact of numerical noise on enforcing $\\sum_{s} Z_{s}\\,\\delta n_{s} - \\delta n_{e} = 0$ and about robust diagnostics to verify quasineutrality in such simulations:\n\nA. In a regime where the true dynamics is slow compared to the characteristic electron charge response and the Debye length is small compared to resolved scales, a persistent nonzero $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ acts as a source for high-frequency electrostatic oscillations.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective question regarding numerical methods in plasma physics, a common scenario in the development and verification of simulation codes. We are asked to evaluate the physical consequences of a residual charge density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$, that arises from numerical noise in a gyrokinetic simulation, and to assess the validity of several proposed diagnostic methods. The analysis will be based on the provided fundamental equations: charge continuity $\\partial_{t}\\rho + \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, Gauss’s law $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho/\\epsilon_{0}$, the electrostatic condition $\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$, and a linearized electron momentum balance.\n\nFirst, let us combine the fundamental equations to describe the plasma's natural response to a charge imbalance. We are given a linearized electron momentum balance for immobile ions, where the electron fluid acceleration is driven by the electric field: $m_e \\partial_{t}\\mathbf{u}_{e} \\approx -e\\mathbf{E}$. The current density is dominated by electrons, so $\\mathbf{J} \\approx \\mathbf{J}_e = -e n_e \\mathbf{u}_e$. For small perturbations around a uniform background with density $n_{e0}$, the time derivative of the current is $\\partial_t \\mathbf{J} \\approx -e n_{e0} \\partial_t \\mathbf{u}_e$. Substituting the momentum balance, we get $\\partial_t \\mathbf{J} \\approx \\frac{n_{e0} e^2}{m_e} \\mathbf{E}$.\n\nNow, we take the time derivative of the continuity equation, $\\partial_{t}^2 \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot (\\partial_t \\mathbf{J}) = 0$. Substituting our expression for $\\partial_t \\mathbf{J}$:\n$$ \\partial_{t}^2 \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{n_{e0} e^2}{m_e} \\mathbf{E} \\right) = 0 $$\nAssuming a spatially uniform background density $n_{e0}$, we can pull the constants out of the divergence:\n$$ \\partial_{t}^2 \\rho + \\frac{n_{e0} e^2}{m_e} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) = 0 $$\nUsing Gauss's law, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho / \\epsilon_0$, we eliminate $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\partial_{t}^2 \\rho + \\frac{n_{e0} e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0} \\rho = 0 $$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, describing charge density oscillations. The characteristic frequency is the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}$, defined by $\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_{e0} e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}$. This derivation shows that any local charge imbalance $\\rho$ will tend to oscillate at $\\omega_{pe}$, a very high frequency. The gyrokinetic model is intended for low-frequency ion-scale turbulence ($\\omega \\ll \\omega_{pe}$) and assumes quasineutrality, $\\rho=0$, holds. A numerical residual $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ violates this assumption and will excite these spurious high-frequency oscillations.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. In a regime where the true dynamics is slow compared to the characteristic electron charge response and the Debye length is small compared to resolved scales, a persistent nonzero $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ acts as a source for high-frequency electrostatic oscillations. In linear response with immobile ions, the induced oscillations occur at a characteristic frequency set by the background electron charge density, so their presence can be detected by a peak in the spectrum of the domain-averaged electric field energy near that frequency.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The described regime is the standard justification for the gyrokinetic model. As derived above, a charge imbalance source will excite oscillations at the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}$, which is determined by the background electron density $n_{e0}$ (and fundamental constants). A persistent $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ due to numerical noise acts as a continuous driver for these oscillations. These charge oscillations create an oscillating electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ via Gauss's law. The energy in the electric field, which is proportional to $E^2$, will therefore also oscillate. A frequency analysis (e.g., a Fast Fourier Transform) of the time history of the total electric field energy, $\\int |\\mathbf{E}|^2 dV$, would reveal a distinct peak at or near $\\omega_{pe}$. Detecting such a peak is a classic method for identifying the unphysical excitation of plasma oscillations in a simulation that should be filtering them out.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If the volume-average of $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ is zero, then $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ can not excite any electric field because Gauss’s law only constrains the box-averaged electric field. Therefore, checking the volume-average of $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$ suffices to certify quasineutrality.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Gauss's law, $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho/\\epsilon_{0}$, is a local differential equation relating the field's divergence to the charge density at each point in space. It is not limited to a constraint on averages. A charge distribution with zero net charge can and does produce an electric field. A simple example is an electric dipole, which consists of two opposite charges ($+q$ and $-q$) separated by a distance, having zero total charge, but producing a non-zero electric field. In the context of a simulation, a charge residual like $\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}(\\mathbf{x}) = A \\cos(k_x x)$ has a zero volume average over a periodic domain, but it will source a non-zero electric field $E_x(\\mathbf{x}) = (A/k_x \\epsilon_0) \\sin(k_x x)$. Therefore, ensuring that the total residual charge $\\int \\rho_{\\mathrm{res}} dV$ is zero is a necessary condition (often enforced in periodic systems) but is completely insufficient for certifying local quasineutrality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A stringent diagnostic is to compute the Fourier-space residual $R_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\left|\\sum_{s} Z_{s}\\, \\delta n_{s,\\mathbf{k}} - \\delta n_{e,\\mathbf{k}}\\right| \\Big/ \\max\\!\\left(\\left|\\sum_{s} Z_{s}\\, \\delta n_{s,\\mathbf{k}}\\right|,\\left| \\delta n_{e,\\mathbf{k}}\\right|\\right)$ for each wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, and verify that $R_{\\mathbf{k}}$ decreases under simultaneous refinement of the time step and grid spacing at fixed physical parameters.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The numerator, $\\left|\\sum_{s} Z_{s}\\, \\delta n_{s,\\mathbf{k}} - \\delta n_{e,\\mathbf{k}}\\right|$, is the magnitude of the violation of the quasineutrality constraint for the Fourier mode with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. The denominator normalizes this error by the typical magnitude of the ion and electron charge density fluctuations at that same scale, yielding a relative error. Examining this relative error for each $\\mathbf{k}$ is a stringent test because it checks the validity of the constraint across all resolved spatial scales, rather than just as a global or volume-averaged quantity. The second part of the statement describes a convergence test. For a valid numerical scheme, the error (which $R_{\\mathbf{k}}$ measures) should systematically decrease as the numerical resolution (grid spacing and time step) is increased. This is a standard and essential procedure in code verification to ensure the discrete solution is approaching the true solution of the model equations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. When the numerical time step resolves the electron charge response timescale, charge residuals are self-correcting through numerical dispersion, so monitoring the discrete continuity equation $\\partial_{t}\\rho + \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$ is unnecessary.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Firstly, the premise is antithetical to the problem's context. An ion-scale gyrokinetic simulation is specifically designed to work with time steps $\\Delta t$ that are much larger than the electron charge response timescale ($1/\\omega_{pe}$), i.e., $\\omega_{pe}\\Delta t \\gg 1$. If one were to resolve this timescale, a different, more computationally expensive algorithm (like an explicit electromagnetic simulation) would be used instead of a quasineutrality constraint. Secondly, the conclusion is unsound. Numerical dispersion is a numerical artifact that causes different wavenumbers to propagate at incorrect speeds; it does not \"self-correct\" violations of fundamental conservation laws. A violation of charge continuity represents a fundamental flaw in the algorithm's integrity. Far from being unnecessary, monitoring charge conservation is a critical diagnostic. Failure to do so can allow unphysical charge to accumulate, generating spurious fields that corrupt or destroy the simulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In codes that do not evolve $\\mathbf{E}$ explicitly (for example, electrostatic gyrokinetic solvers where $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$ is determined from a constraint), the discrete Gauss’s law $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\rho/\\epsilon_{0}$ is irrelevant and cannot be used as a diagnostic.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. In the described code, the potential $\\phi$ is found by solving an approximation to Gauss's law (the quasineutrality condition). The code does, however, contain all the information needed to check the original, un-approximated law. At any time, one can compute the charge density $\\rho$ from the particle/distribution function data and the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ from the potential $\\phi$. One can then independently calculate both sides of Gauss's law, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$ and $\\rho/\\epsilon_0$, using discrete difference operators and the available data. Comparing these two quantities provides a powerful *a posteriori* diagnostic. The degree to which they differ is a direct measure of how much the numerical solution deviates from satisfying the fundamental law that was approximated by the quasineutrality constraint. It is therefore a highly relevant diagnostic, not an irrelevant one.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. A practical diagnostic is to compute the temporal cross-correlation $C = \\left\\langle \\left(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}\\right)(t)\\, \\left[-\\partial_{t}\\rho\\right](t) \\right\\rangle \\Big/ \\left(\\left\\langle \\left(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}\\right)^{2}\\right\\rangle^{1/2}\\, \\left\\langle \\left(\\partial_{t}\\rho\\right)^{2}\\right\\rangle^{1/2}\\right)$, which should be close to $+1$ if the discrete continuity equation is satisfied; sustained departures indicate sources of charge non-conservation that can feed quasineutrality errors.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The expression for $C$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two fields $X = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$ and $Y = -\\partial_t \\rho$. The charge continuity equation is $\\partial_t \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, which can be rewritten as $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = -\\partial_t \\rho$. If a numerical algorithm perfectly satisfies a discrete analogue of this equation, then the two numerical quantities representing $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$ and $-\\partial_t \\rho$ will be identical. The correlation coefficient of a variable with itself is exactly $+1$. Any numerical procedure that fails to perfectly conserve charge will introduce a source or sink term $S$, such that $\\partial_t \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = S$. In this case, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} \\neq -\\partial_t \\rho$, and the correlation $C$ will be less than $+1$. A sustained departure of $C$ from $+1$ is therefore a direct and robust indicator of a breakdown in numerical charge conservation. Such a breakdown is a primary source of quasineutrality violations ($\\rho_{\\mathrm{res}}$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
