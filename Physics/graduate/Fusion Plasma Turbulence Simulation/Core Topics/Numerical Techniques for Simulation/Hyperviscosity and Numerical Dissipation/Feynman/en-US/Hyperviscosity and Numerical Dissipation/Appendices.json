It is a standard numerical stability analysis exercise that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe evolution of a single Fourier mode amplitude, $\\hat{\\phi}_k(t)$, under the influence of the hyperviscosity operator is described by the linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}_k}{dt} = \\lambda_k \\hat{\\phi}_k\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_k$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to the wavenumber $k$. For the given hyperviscosity term of order $n=2$, the eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = -\\nu_2 k^4\n$$\n\nThe problem states that this ODE is discretized in time using an explicit Forward Euler scheme. Let $\\hat{\\phi}_k^j$ denote the value of the Fourier amplitude at time step $j$. The Forward Euler update is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}_k^{j+1} - \\hat{\\phi}_k^j}{\\Delta t} = \\lambda_k \\hat{\\phi}_k^j\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the time step. Rearranging this equation gives the update rule for $\\hat{\\phi}_k$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\phi}_k^{j+1} = \\hat{\\phi}_k^j + \\Delta t (\\lambda_k \\hat{\\phi}_k^j) = (1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t) \\hat{\\phi}_k^j\n$$\nThe term $G_k = 1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t$ is the amplification factor for the mode $k$. For the numerical scheme to be stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any mode. This prevents the unbounded growth of any component of the numerical solution. The stability condition is therefore:\n$$\n|G_k| \\le 1 \\quad \\forall k\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_k$, we have:\n$$\n|1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t| \\le 1\n$$\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_k = -\\nu_2 k^4$ is a real, non-positive number, since the hyperviscosity coefficient $\\nu_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{m}^4/\\mathrm{s}$ is positive. The stability condition for a real, non-positive eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in a Forward Euler scheme is a well-known result. We can derive it by considering the inequality $|1 + \\lambda \\Delta t| \\le 1$. Since $\\lambda \\Delta t \\le 0$, we have:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t \\le 1\n$$\nThe right side of the inequality, $1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t \\le 1$, simplifies to $\\lambda_k \\Delta t \\le 0$, which is always satisfied given that $\\lambda_k \\le 0$ and $\\Delta t \\ge 0$. The left side of the inequality provides the non-trivial constraint:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 + \\lambda_k \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n-2 \\le \\lambda_k \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{-2}{\\lambda_k} = \\frac{2}{-\\lambda_k} = \\frac{2}{|\\lambda_k|}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_k$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\nu_2 k^4}\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all wavenumbers $k$ resolved on the numerical grid. To ensure global stability, the time step $\\Delta t$ must be chosen to satisfy the most restrictive case. The right-hand side of the inequality is minimized when the denominator, $\\nu_2 k^4$, is maximized. This occurs at the highest representable wavenumber, $k_{\\max}$. Therefore, the maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\nu_2 k_{\\max}^4}\n$$\nThe problem provides the grid spacing $\\Delta x = \\pi/5000 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and defines the maximum wavenumber as the Nyquist wavenumber, $k_{\\max} = \\pi/\\Delta x$.\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\pi/5000 \\, \\mathrm{m}} = 5000 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can substitute the numerical values for $\\nu_2$ and $k_{\\max}$ into the expression for $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\nu_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^4}{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\max} = 5 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^4}{\\mathrm{s}}) (5 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1})^4}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) (5^4 \\times (10^3)^4)} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) (625 \\times 10^{12})} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{2.0 \\times 625 \\times 10^{(-11+12)}} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{1250 \\times 10^1} \\, \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{2}{12500} \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{6250} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 0.00016 \\, \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in microseconds ($\\mu\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\n1 \\, \\mathrm{s} = 10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = 0.00016 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{s} = 160 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nFinally, we must round the answer to four significant figures.

The coefficients are:\n$$\nc_{i-2} = -r, \\quad c_{i-1} = 4r, \\quad c_{i} = 1-6r, \\quad c_{i+1} = 4r, \\quad c_{i+2} = -r\n$$\nA convex combination requires all coefficients to be non-negative, $c_{j} \\geq 0$, and their sum to be unity, $\\sum_j c_j = 1$. Let's check the sum of the coefficients:\n$$\n\\sum c_j = (-r) + (4r) + (1-6r) + (4r) + (-r) = 1 + (-1+4-6+4-1)r = 1 + 0r = 1\n$$\nThe sum is always unity. However, for the coefficients to be non-negative, we would need:\n$$\n-r \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4r \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1-6r \\geq 0\n$$\nSince the problem specifies that $\\nu_h > 0$, $\\Delta t > 0$, and $\\Delta x > 0$, the parameter $r = \\nu_h \\Delta t / \\Delta x^4$ must be strictly positive, $r > 0$. The condition $-r \\geq 0$ can therefore never be satisfied for any nonzero $r$.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The update can **never** be written as a convex combination for any nonzero $r$. A sufficient condition for a numerical scheme to satisfy a discrete maximum principle (DMP) is that the update is a convex combination. Since this condition is violated, the scheme is not guaranteed to satisfy the DMP. The presence of negative coefficients ($c_{i\\pm2}=-r$) means that the solution can develop overshoots (local maxima increasing in time) or undershoots (local minima decreasing in time), which are non-physical oscillations, even if the scheme is numerically stable.\n\n**Part 2: Amplification Factor and Positivity Condition**\n\nWe perform a discrete Fourier analysis (von Neumann analysis) by considering a single Fourier mode, $u_{j}^{n} = \\hat{u}^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} j \\theta)$, where $\\theta = k \\Delta x$. The amplification factor $G(\\theta)$ is defined such that $u_{j}^{n+1} = G(\\theta)u_{j}^{n}$. Substituting the Fourier mode into the discrete update scheme gives:\n$$\nG(\\theta) \\hat{u}^{n} \\exp(\\mathrm{i}i\\theta) = \\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}i\\theta) - r \\left( \\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}(i-2)\\theta) - 4\\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}(i-1)\\theta) + 6\\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}i\\theta) - 4\\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}(i+1)\\theta) + \\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}(i+2)\\theta) \\right)\n$$\nDividing by the common factor $\\hat{u}^{n}\\exp(\\mathrm{i}i\\theta)$, we obtain the amplification factor $G(\\theta)$:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = 1 - r \\left( \\exp(-2\\mathrm{i}\\theta) - 4\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + 6 - 4\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + \\exp(2\\mathrm{i}\\theta) \\right)\n$$\nWe can simplify the expression in the parenthesis by grouping the complex exponential terms:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = 1 - r \\left[ (\\exp(2\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + \\exp(-2\\mathrm{i}\\theta)) - 4(\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta)) + 6 \\right]\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\phi) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\phi)}{2}$, this becomes:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = 1 - r \\left[ 2\\cos(2\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 6 \\right]\n$$\nTo simplify further, we use the trigonometric identities $\\cos(\\theta) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\cos(2\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1 = 2(1-2\\sin^2(\\theta/2))^2-1$:\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\cos(2\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 6 &= 2(2\\cos^2(\\theta)-1) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 6 \\\\\n&= 4\\cos^2(\\theta) - 8\\cos(\\theta) + 4 \\\\\n&= 4(\\cos(\\theta) - 1)^2 \\\\\n&= 4\\left( (1-2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)) - 1 \\right)^2 \\\\\n&= 4\\left( -2\\sin^2(\\theta/2) \\right)^2 \\\\\n&= 4\\left( 4\\sin^4(\\theta/2) \\right) \\\\\n&= 16\\sin^4(\\theta/2)\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting this simplified expression back into the equation for $G(\\theta)$:\n$$\nG(\\theta) = 1 - 16 r \\sin^4(\\frac{\\theta}{2})\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the largest value $r_{\\max}$ such that $G(\\theta) \\geq 0$ for all $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. This condition prevents sign reversals of Fourier components, which is a key mechanism for generating overshoots and undershoots.\n$$\n1 - 16 r \\sin^4(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\geq 0\n$$\n$$\n1 \\geq 16 r \\sin^4(\\frac{\\theta}{2})\n$$\nSince $r > 0$, we can write:\n$$\nr \\leq \\frac{1}{16 \\sin^4(\\frac{\\theta}{2})}\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all values of $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. The most restrictive case (i.e., the one that places the tightest upper bound on $r$) occurs when the term $\\sin^4(\\theta/2)$ reaches its maximum value. For $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, the argument $\\theta/2$ is in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$. The function $\\sin(\\phi)$ is maximized on this interval at $\\phi = \\pi/2$, which corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi$.\nThe maximum value is:\n$$\n\\max_{\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]} \\sin^4(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) = \\sin^4(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (1)^4 = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this maximum value into the inequality gives the most restrictive condition on $r$:\n$$\nr \\leq \\frac{1}{16 \\cdot 1} \\implies r \\leq \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\nTherefore, the largest value of $r$ that guarantees $G(\\theta) \\geq 0$ for all modes is $r_{\\max} = 1/16$.",
