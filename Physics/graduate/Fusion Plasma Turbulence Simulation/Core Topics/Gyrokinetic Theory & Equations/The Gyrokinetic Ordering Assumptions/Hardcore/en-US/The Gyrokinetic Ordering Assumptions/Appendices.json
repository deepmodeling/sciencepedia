A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the ion gyroradius from first principles, evaluating it for the given parameters, and then calculating the GK small parameter $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is described by the Lorentz force. In the absence of an electric field, the force on an ion of charge $q$ and mass $m_i$ moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by:\n$$ \\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\nFor a singly charged ion, the charge is $q=+e$. This force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, so it does no work on the particle, and the particle's kinetic energy and speed remain constant. The force causes the ion to undergo circular motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. This motion is called gyromotion.\n\nLet $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_\\parallel + \\vec{v}_\\perp$, where $\\vec{v}_\\parallel$ is the component of velocity parallel to $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{v}_\\perp$ is the component perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$. The force only depends on the perpendicular component:\n$$ |\\vec{F}| = e |\\vec{v}_\\perp \\times \\vec{B}| = e v_\\perp B $$\nwhere $v_\\perp = |\\vec{v}_\\perp|$. This force provides the centripetal acceleration, $a_c = v_\\perp^2 / \\rho_i$, necessary for circular motion of radius $\\rho_i$. Applying Newton's second law, $F = m_i a_c$:\n$$ e v_\\perp B = \\frac{m_i v_\\perp^2}{\\rho_i} $$\nSolving for the gyroradius $\\rho_i$ gives:\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{m_i v_\\perp}{e B} $$\nThis expression depends on the perpendicular speed $v_\\perp$. The problem asks for the *thermal* ion gyroradius, which requires selecting a characteristic speed for a population of ions in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T_i$.\n\n**1. Definition of Thermal Speed**\n\nFor a plasma in thermal equilibrium, the ion velocities follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. For an isotropic distribution, the average kinetic energy is equally partitioned among the three degrees of freedom, with each degree of freedom holding an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T_{i,K}$, where $T_{i,K}$ is the ion temperature in Kelvin and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. It is standard in plasma physics to express temperature in units of energy (e.g., electronvolts, eV), where $T_i = k_B T_{i,K}$.\n\nThe gyromotion is a two-dimensional phenomenon occurring in the plane perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$. The kinetic energy associated with this perpendicular motion is $K_\\perp = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_\\perp^2$. The average perpendicular kinetic energy corresponds to two degrees of freedom:\n$$ \\langle K_\\perp \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_\\perp^2 \\right\\rangle = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2} T_i\\right) = T_i $$\nHere, $T_i$ denotes the ion temperature in units of energy (Joules). The characteristic perpendicular speed is therefore defined as the speed corresponding to this average perpendicular energy, which is the root-mean-square (RMS) perpendicular speed:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_{ti}^2 = T_i \\implies v_{ti} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_i}{m_i}} $$\nWe adopt this definition for the characteristic thermal speed $v_\\perp$ in the gyroradius formula. This is a standard and physically justified convention.\n\n**2. Derivation of Symbolic $\\rho_i$**\n\nSubstituting $v_\\perp = v_{ti} = \\sqrt{2T_i/m_i}$ into the expression for $\\rho_i$:\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{m_i}{e B} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_i}{m_i}} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_i^2}}{e B} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 T_i}}{\\sqrt{m_i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_i T_i}}{e B} $$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the thermal ion gyroradius. In this formula, $T_i$ must be in units of Joules.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation for Deuterium**\n\nWe are given the parameters in SI units, except for the ion temperature, which is $T_i = 10 \\text{ keV}$. We first convert this to Joules using the provided conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = e\\,\\mathrm{J}$:\n$$ T_i = 10 \\text{ keV} = 10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ eV} = 10^4 \\text{ eV} $$\n$$ T_i(\\text{J}) = 10^4 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}) \\, \\mathrm{J} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\mathrm{J} $$\nNow we substitute the numerical values into the expression for $\\rho_i$:\n- $m_i = m_D = 3.343583719 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $T_i = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $B = 3\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\times (3.343583719 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-15})}}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times 3} $$\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{1.0714426 \\times 10^{-41}}}{4.8065299 \\times 10^{-19}} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{3.2732898 \\times 10^{-21}}{4.8065299 \\times 10^{-19}} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\rho_i = 0.681023 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m} = 6.81023 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the result in millimeters ($1 \\text{ m} = 10^3 \\text{ mm}$):\n$$ \\rho_i = 6.81023 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\rho_i \\approx 6.81 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**4. Computation of $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe dimensionless parameter $\\epsilon$ is defined as $\\epsilon = \\rho_i / L$. Using the unrounded value for $\\rho_i$ and the given $L = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{6.81023 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{0.3 \\, \\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\epsilon = 0.0227007... $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\epsilon \\approx 0.0227$.\n\n**5. Comment on the Gyrokinetic Ordering**\n\nThe fundamental assumption of the gyrokinetic ordering is that the parameter $\\epsilon = \\rho_i/L$ is much less than unity, i.e., $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Our calculation for these representative tokamak parameters yields $\\epsilon \\approx 0.0227$. Since $0.0227$ is a small number, significantly less than $1$, we conclude that the small gyroradius assumption underpinning the gyrokinetic framework is quantitatively well-justified for this scenario.\n\nThe final requested answer is the pair $(\\rho_i \\text{ in mm}, \\epsilon)$ rounded to three significant figures.\n- $\\rho_i \\approx 6.81$\n- $\\epsilon \\approx 0.0227$",

All necessary information is provided, and the parameters are physically realistic for a magnetically confined fusion plasma. The problem requests the derivation of a fundamental ordering parameter in gyrokinetic theory, a numerical calculation, and an interpretation of the result, all of which are standard exercises in plasma physics.\n\nThe starting point is the equilibrium Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for ions, where the probability of a state is proportional to the factor $\\exp(-H/T_i)$. The Hamiltonian $H$ for a single ion of mass $m_i$ and charge $Z_i e$ moving with velocity $v$ in an electrostatic potential $\\phi$ is given as:\n$$\nH = \\frac{1}{2} m_i v^2 + Z_i e \\phi\n$$\nHere, $\\frac{1}{2} m_i v^2$ is the kinetic energy and $Z_i e \\phi$ is the potential energy. $T_i$ is the ion temperature, which represents the characteristic thermal energy of the ion population.\n\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian into the Maxwell–Boltzmann factor gives:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{H}{T_i}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m_i v^2 + Z_i e \\phi}{T_i}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be separated into two parts:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m_i v^2}{T_i}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Z_i e \\phi}{T_i}\\right)\n$$\nThe first term, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m_i v^2}{T_i}\\right)$, describes the unperturbed Maxwellian velocity distribution, where the kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2} m_i v^2$ is, on average, of the order of the thermal energy $T_i$. The second term, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Z_i e \\phi}{T_i}\\right)$, describes how the presence of the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ modifies this distribution.\n\nThe gyrokinetic framework is a perturbative theory that assumes the fluctuations, represented here by the potential $\\phi$, are of small amplitude. This assumption allows for a systematic expansion of the governing equations. For the particle distribution function, a small-amplitude assumption implies that the distribution is only weakly perturbed from its equilibrium Maxwellian form. This is mathematically equivalent to the condition that the argument of the exponential factor containing the potential energy is small in magnitude.\n\nThe expansion of the exponential function for a small argument $x$ is $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$. Applying this to the potential-dependent term, we get:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Z_i e \\phi}{T_i}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{Z_i e \\phi}{T_i}\n$$\nThis linear approximation is valid only if the magnitude of the argument is much less than unity:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{Z_i e \\phi}{T_i} \\right| \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition states that the potential energy associated with the electrostatic fluctuations, $Z_i e \\phi$, must be much smaller than the characteristic thermal energy of the particles, $T_i$. The dimensionless parameter that quantifies this ordering is therefore $\\frac{Z_i e \\phi}{T_i}$. For a consistent gyrokinetic expansion, this parameter must be small. This is the dimensionless amplitude parameter required by the problem.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the value of this parameter for the given core-ion parameters: $T_i = 5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $\\phi = 50\\,\\mathrm{V}$, and $Z_i = 1$. The problem specifies that $T_i$ is given in units of energy (kilo-electron-volts), a standard convention in plasma physics that absorbs the Boltzmann constant $k_B$. An electron-volt ($eV$) is a unit of energy defined as the energy gained by a particle with one elementary charge $e$ when accelerated through a potential difference of $1$ volt.\nTherefore, a temperature of $T_i = 5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ is equivalent to an energy of:\n$$\nT_i = 5 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 5000\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe potential energy term, for $Z_i=1$, is $e \\phi$. With $\\phi = 50\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the potential energy is:\n$$\ne \\phi = e \\cdot (50\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 50\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nNow we can compute the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{e \\phi}{T_i}$ (since $Z_i=1$):\n$$\n\\frac{e \\phi}{T_i} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{5000\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{50}{5000} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01\n$$\nThe units of energy ($\\mathrm{eV}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless number.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether this value is consistent with the small-amplitude assumption. The derived ordering criterion is that this parameter must be much less than $1$. Our calculated value is $0.01$. Since $0.01 \\ll 1$, the given parameters are indeed consistent with the small-amplitude ordering assumption that underpins the validity of the gyrokinetic model for describing turbulence in the plasma core.",

An alternative common form is $D_{gB} \\sim \\rho_* D_B$, where $\\rho_* = \\rho_i/L$ and $D_B = T_i/(eB)$ is the Bohm diffusivity. Since $\\rho_* \\propto B^{-1}$ and $D_B \\propto B^{-1}$, we again find $D_{gB} \\propto B^{-2}$.\n\n**Task 2: Analysis of Ordering Violations**\n\n**(i) Case of large amplitude fluctuations: $e\\phi/T_i \\sim O(1)$**\n\nIn this case, the fluctuation amplitude is no longer small. We retain the other assumptions, such as $k_\\perp \\rho_i \\sim O(1)$. We again start from $D \\sim \\phi/B$.\nThe revised amplitude ordering is:\n$$ \\frac{e\\phi}{T_i} \\sim O(1) \\implies \\phi \\sim \\frac{T_i}{e} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D$:\n$$ D \\sim \\frac{1}{B} \\left(\\frac{T_i}{e}\\right) = \\frac{T_i}{eB} $$\nThis is the definition of the **Bohm diffusion** coefficient, $D_B$. The scaling with the magnetic field is immediately apparent from the formula:\n$$ D \\propto B^{-1} $$\nThis indicates a transition from the gyro-Bohm regime to a less favorable, Bohm-like transport regime.\n\n**(ii) Case of strong parallel dynamics: $k_\\parallel \\sim k_\\perp$**\n\nHere, the turbulence is isotropic, violating the standard GK assumption of strong anisotropy ($k_\\parallel \\ll k_\\perp$). The saturation mechanism is given by the balance of the nonlinear shearing rate, $\\omega_E$, and the parallel streaming decorrelation rate, $\\gamma_\\parallel$.\n$$ \\omega_E \\sim \\gamma_\\parallel $$\nUsing the provided definitions:\n$$ k_\\perp v_E \\sim k_\\parallel v_{th,i} \\implies \\frac{k_\\perp^2 \\phi}{B} \\sim k_\\parallel v_{th,i} $$\nWe apply the condition for this violation, $k_\\parallel \\sim k_\\perp$:\n$$ \\frac{k_\\perp^2 \\phi}{B} \\sim k_\\perp v_{th,i} $$\nSolving for the fluctuation amplitude $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi \\sim \\frac{B v_{th,i}}{k_\\perp} $$\nTo determine the transport scaling, we substitute this $\\phi$ back into $D \\sim \\phi/B$:\n$$ D \\sim \\frac{1}{B} \\left(\\frac{B v_{th,i}}{k_\\perp}\\right) = \\frac{v_{th,i}}{k_\\perp} $$\nWe are still assuming that the perpendicular scale is gyro-radius-scale, i.e., $k_\\perp \\rho_i \\sim O(1)$, which implies $k_\\perp \\sim 1/\\rho_i$.\n$$ D \\sim v_{th,i} \\rho_i $$\nNow, we check the magnetic field scaling. Since $v_{th,i}$ is independent of $B$ and $\\rho_i \\propto B^{-1}$:\n$$ D \\propto B^{-1} $$\nThis is again a Bohm-like scaling. We can show this is consistent with Case (i). Let's determine the implied fluctuation amplitude for Case (ii).\nFrom $\\phi \\sim B v_{th,i} / k_\\perp$ and $k_\\perp \\sim 1/\\rho_i$:\n$$ \\phi \\sim B v_{th,i} \\rho_i = B v_{th,i} \\left(\\frac{v_{th,i}}{\\Omega_i}\\right) = B v_{th,i} \\left(\\frac{m_i v_{th,i}}{eB}\\right) = \\frac{m_i v_{th,i}^2}{e} $$\nNormalizing this amplitude:\n$$ \\frac{e\\phi}{T_i} \\sim \\frac{e}{T_i} \\left(\\frac{m_i v_{th,i}^2}{e}\\right) = \\frac{m_i v_{th,i}^2}{T_i} $$\nSince $T_i = m_i v_{th,i}^2/2$ (up to a factor of order unity), we find:\n$$ \\frac{e\\phi}{T_i} \\sim O(1) $$\nThis shows that the loss of strong anisotropy, combined with the stated saturation mechanism, forces the fluctuation amplitude to be large, collapsing this case into the same regime as Case (i). Both violations lead to Bohm-like transport with $D \\propto B^{-1}$.\n\n**Task 3: Option Evaluation**\n\n- **Summary of Results**:\n    - Standard GK ordering: $D \\propto B^{-2}$ (gyro-Bohm).\n    - Violation (i) $e\\phi/T_i \\sim O(1)$: $D \\propto B^{-1}$ (Bohm-like).\n    - Violation (ii) $k_\\parallel \\sim k_\\perp$: $D \\propto B^{-1}$ (Bohm-like), as it implies $e\\phi/T_i \\sim O(1)$.\n\n- **Diagnostics for Ordering Breakdown**:\n    - To check if $e\\phi/T_i \\sim O(\\epsilon)$ is violated, one must directly measure the statistical distribution of $e\\phi/T_i$ in a simulation. A probability density function (PDF) with significant weight near unity signals breakdown.\n    - To check if $k_\\parallel/k_\\perp \\sim O(\\epsilon)$ is violated, one must analyze the fluctuation power spectrum in wavenumber space, $S(k_\\perp, k_\\parallel)$. If the power is not confined to a narrow region where $k_\\parallel \\ll k_\\perp$, this ordering has broken down. Monitoring spectral anisotropy is the direct diagnostic.\n    - To confirm the transport scaling ($D \\propto B^{-2}$ vs $D \\propto B^{-1}$), the definitive test is to perform a series of simulations where $B$ is scanned while other relevant dimensionless parameters are held constant, and measure the resulting diffusivity $D$.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n**A.** The scaling for case (i) is stated as Bohm-like, $D \\sim T_i/(eB)$ or $D \\propto B^{-1}$. This is **Correct**. The scaling for case (ii) is also stated to become Bohm-like with $D \\propto B^{-1}$ due to $e\\phi/T_i$ being driven to $O(1)$. This is **Correct**. The proposed diagnostics are: monitoring the PDF of $e\\phi/T_i$, monitoring spectral anisotropy $k_\\parallel/k_\\perp$, and performing scans in $B$ to test the transport scaling. These are precisely the correct and most direct diagnostics. This option is fully consistent with our derivations. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** The scaling for case (i) is stated as $D \\propto B^{-2}$. This is **Incorrect**. The scaling for case (ii) is stated as $D \\propto B^{-3}$. This is **Incorrect**. The diagnostics (Courant number, energy conservation) test numerical fidelity, not the validity of the physical model's assumptions. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** The scaling for case (i) is stated as $D \\propto B^{-2}$. This is **Incorrect**. The scaling for case (ii) is stated as $D \\propto B^{0}$. This is **Incorrect**. The diagnostics are indirect and not primary for the specified violations. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** The scaling for case (i), $D \\propto B^{-1}$, is correct. However, the scaling for case (ii) is stated as remaining gyro-Bohm, $D \\propto B^{-2}$. This is **Incorrect**. The diagnostic part is partially reasonable (measuring parallel correlation lengths) but incorrectly dismisses the importance of $B$ scans for transport validation. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** The scaling for both cases is stated as remaining gyro-Bohm, $D \\propto B^{-2}$. This is **Incorrect**. The proposed diagnostic (electron skin depth) is irrelevant to the ion-scale, electrostatic GK ordering breakdown being discussed. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the physics and the proposed options, Option A is the only one that correctly describes the scaling laws in both scenarios and proposes a complete and appropriate set of diagnostic methods.",
