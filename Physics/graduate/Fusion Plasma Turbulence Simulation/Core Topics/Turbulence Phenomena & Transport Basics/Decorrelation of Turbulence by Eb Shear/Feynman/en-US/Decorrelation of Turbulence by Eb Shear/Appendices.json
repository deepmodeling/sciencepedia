            "solution": "The evolution of the fluctuation is governed by the advection equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} + V_{E}(x)\\,\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial y}=0\n$$\nWith $V_{E}(x) = S x$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} + S x \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial y}=0\n$$\nTo find the evolution of the carrier wavenumber $\\mathbf{k}(t) = (k_x(t), k_y(t))$, we use the eikonal approximation.

Substituting a plane-wave form $\\varphi \\propto \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} - i\\omega t)$ into the equation gives:\n$$\n-i\\omega + S x (i k_y) = 0\n$$\nThis yields the position-dependent dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega(\\mathbf{k}, x, y) = S k_y x\n$$\nThe evolution of the wavenumber components along a ray path is given by the Hamiltonian ray-tracing equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dk_x}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial x} \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\frac{dk_y}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial y}\n$$\nUsing our expression for $\\omega$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{dk_y}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(S k_y x) = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $k_y$ is a constant of motion, consistent with the homogeneity of the system in the $y$ direction. Thus, $k_y(t) = k_y(0) = k_y$, where $k_y$ is the constant initial poloidal wavenumber.\nFor the radial wavenumber $k_x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dk_x}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(S k_y x) = -S k_y\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to time from $t=0$ to a general time $t$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{k_x(0)}^{k_x(t)} dk'_x = \\int_{0}^{t} (-S k_y) dt'\n$$\n$$\nk_x(t) - k_x(0) = -S k_y t\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $k_x(0) = k_{x0}$, we obtain the evolution law for the radial wavenumber:\n$$\nk_x(t) = k_{x0} - S k_y t\n$$\nTherefore, the evolution of the carrier wavenumber vector is $\\mathbf{k}(t) = \\big(k_{x0} - S k_y t, k_y\\big)$.\n\nThis result shows how spectral anisotropy develops. At $t=0$, the fluctuation is characterized by $|k_{x0}| \\ll |k_y|$, meaning the wave vector is almost purely in the poloidal ($y$) direction. As time progresses, the magnitude of the radial wavenumber, $|k_x(t)|$, grows linearly with time. This signifies a tilting of the wave fronts and a transfer of fluctuation energy in k-space from low $k_x$ to high $k_x$. The initially poloidally-oriented spectrum is sheared out along the $k_x$ axis.\n\nNext, we derive the shear suppression time $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$ using the given dephasing criterion, $|k_{x}(t)|\\,L_{x}=1$. This criterion physically means that decorrelation occurs when the phase variation across the radial width of the streamer, $L_x$, becomes of order unity, causing destructive interference and breakup of the coherent structure.\nSubstituting our expression for $k_x(t)$:\n$$\n|k_{x0} - S k_y t_{\\mathrm{supp}}| L_x = 1\n$$\nThe problem specifies that for the numerical evaluation, we should take $k_{x0} \\approx 0$. Applying this simplification to the symbolic derivation:\n$$\n|-S k_y t_{\\mathrm{supp}}| L_x = 1\n$$\nSince $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$ is a time, it must be non-negative. We can rearrange to solve for $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$:\n$$\n|S k_y| t_{\\mathrm{supp}} L_x = 1\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{supp}} = \\frac{1}{|S k_y| L_x}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the shear suppression time.\n\nNow, we explain why radially extended streamers are preferentially suppressed. Radially extended streamers are, by definition, structures with a large radial extent, i.e., large $L_x$. Our derived expression shows that $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$ is inversely proportional to $L_x$. A larger $L_x$ results in a smaller $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$, which signifies faster (and thus more effective) suppression. This occurs because a larger radial extent means the top and bottom of the streamer experience a greater velocity difference $\\Delta V_E = S L_x$, leading to more rapid tearing of the structure. The problem notes this happens even when $k_y$ is small. Our formula shows $t_{\\mathrm{supp}} \\propto 1/|k_y|$, which would suggest slow suppression for small $k_y$. However, the suppression *rate* is $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{supp}} \\equiv 1/t_{\\mathrm{supp}} = |S k_y| L_x$. This rate depends on the product $|k_y| L_x$. In many turbulence scenarios, large, transport-driving eddies (streamers) are characterized by both large $L_x$ and small $k_y$. The large value of $L_x$ can make the product $|k_y| L_x$ large enough for efficient suppression, even if $k_y$ itself is small. This demonstrates that E$\\times$B shear is particularly effective at suppressing the most radially elongated, and often most transport-relevant, turbulent structures.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$ for the given parameters:\n$S=7.5\\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{y}\\rho_{s}=0.06 \\implies k_y = 0.06 / \\rho_s$\n$L_{x}=12\\,\\rho_{s}$\n$k_{x0}\\approx 0$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $t_{\\mathrm{supp}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{supp}} = \\frac{1}{|S k_y L_x|} = \\frac{1}{\\left| (7.5 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.06}{\\rho_s}\\right) \\times (12\\,\\rho_{s}) \\right|}\n$$\nThe $\\rho_s$ units cancel out, as expected:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{supp}} = \\frac{1}{7.5 \\times 10^{4} \\times 0.06 \\times 12}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nCalculate the denominator:\n$$\n7.5 \\times 10^{4} \\times 0.06 \\times 12 = 7.5 \\times 0.72 \\times 10^{4} = 5.4 \\times 10^{4}\n$$\nSo, the suppression time in seconds is:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{supp}} = \\frac{1}{5.4 \\times 10^{4}}\\ \\text{s} \\approx 1.85185 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in microseconds ($\\mu\\text{s}$).

The Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}\\left(\\frac{dI}{dt}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma_E}\\left(\\frac{dI}{dt}\\right) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I}\\left(\\frac{d\\gamma_E}{dt}\\right) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma_E}\\left(\\frac{d\\gamma_E}{dt}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} - \\gamma_E - 2\\mu I & -I \\\\ \\sigma & -\\nu \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEvaluating the Jacobian at the fixed point $(I_*, \\gamma_{E*})$:\n$$\nJ_* = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} - \\gamma_{E*} - 2\\mu I_* & -I_* \\\\ \\sigma & -\\nu \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the steady-state condition $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} - \\gamma_{E*} - \\mu I_* = 0$, the top-left element becomes $\\mu I_* - 2\\mu I_* = -\\mu I_*$.\nThus, the Jacobian at the fixed point is:\n$$\nJ_* = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu I_* & -I_* \\\\ \\sigma & -\\nu \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J_* - \\lambda I_{\\text{matrix}}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu I_* - \\lambda & -I_* \\\\ \\sigma & -\\nu - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(-\\mu I_* - \\lambda)(-\\nu - \\lambda) - (-I_*)(\\sigma) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\lambda + \\mu I_*)(\\lambda + \\nu) + \\sigma I_* = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + (\\nu + \\mu I_*)\\lambda + \\mu\\nu I_* + \\sigma I_* = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + (\\nu + \\mu I_*)\\lambda + (\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)I_* = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\lambda$. The roots are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-(\\nu + \\mu I_*) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\nu + \\mu I_*)^2 - 4(\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)I_*}}{2}\n$$\nFor a stable focus, the eigenvalues must be a complex conjugate pair with a negative real part. The real part is $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda) = -\\frac{\\nu + \\mu I_*}{2}$. Since $\\nu, \\mu, I_* > 0$, the real part is negative, so the fixed point is stable. For the eigenvalues to be complex, the discriminant must be negative:\n$$\n\\Delta = (\\nu + \\mu I_*)^2 - 4(\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)I_* < 0\n$$\nThe imaginary part of the eigenvalues is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda) = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{-\\Delta}}{2} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{4(\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)I_* - (\\nu + \\mu I_*)^2}}{2}\n$$\nThe small-amplitude oscillation angular frequency $\\omega$ is the magnitude of the imaginary part of the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\omega = |\\mathrm{Im}(\\lambda)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{4(\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)I_* - (\\nu + \\mu I_*)^2}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting $I_* = \\frac{\\nu \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}}{\\sigma + \\mu\\nu}$ into the term $4(\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)I_*$:\n$4(\\mu\\nu + \\sigma)\\left(\\frac{\\nu \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}}{\\sigma + \\mu\\nu}\\right) = 4\\nu\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$.\nSo, we can simplify the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{4\\nu\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} - (\\nu + \\mu I_*)^2}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for $\\omega$.\n\n**3.
