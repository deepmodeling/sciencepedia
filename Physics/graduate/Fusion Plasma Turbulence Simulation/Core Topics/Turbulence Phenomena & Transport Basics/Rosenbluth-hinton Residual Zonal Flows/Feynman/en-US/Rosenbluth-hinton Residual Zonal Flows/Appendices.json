            "problem": "Consider an electrostatic, collisionless, axisymmetric tokamak in the large-aspect-ratio limit with inverse aspect ratio $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, safety factor $q$, and magnetic shear $s \\equiv (r/q)(dq/dr)$. Focus on the long-wavelength zonal perturbations of the electric potential $\\phi(r,t)$ that are poloidally and toroidally symmetric (i.e., $m=n=0$), with initial amplitude $\\phi(r,0) = \\phi_{0}(r)$ and radial wavenumber $k_{r}$ satisfying $k_{r}\\rho_{i} \\ll 1$, where $\\rho_{i}$ is the ion Larmor radius. Assume single ion species with Maxwellian distribution, adiabatic electrons, and neglect finite plasma beta, collisions, and sources/sinks.\n\nUsing the linear gyrokinetic framework and the conservation properties of collisionless dynamics, derive the residual zonal flow level $R_{\\text{RH}}$ (the Rosenbluth–Hinton residual), defined as\n$$\nR_{\\text{RH}} \\equiv \\frac{\\phi(r,t \\to \\infty)}{\\phi_{0}(r)} \\, ,\n$$\nin terms of the parameters $q$, $\\epsilon$, and $s$ in the stated ordering.

The final answer must be a single expression; do not present it as an inequality or an equation to be solved.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Rosenbluth–Hinton residual zonal flow level, $R_{\\text{RH}} \\equiv \\phi(t \\to \\infty)/\\phi_0$, in a collisionless, electrostatic, large-aspect-ratio tokamak. The derivation will be performed within the linear gyrokinetic framework, assuming quasi-neutrality.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the evolution of the zonal flow potential from its initial value $\\phi_0(r)$ to its final, steady-state value $\\phi(r, t \\to \\infty) \\equiv \\phi_\\infty(r)$ is the conservation of the total charge associated with the zonal flow mode in an isolated system. This can be conceptualized by treating the plasma as a dielectric medium with a frequency-dependent capacitance. An initial charge separation is created to support the initial potential $\\phi_0$. This charge is then held by the plasma, and as the system relaxes to its final state, the potential adjusts according to the change in the plasma's effective capacitance.\n\nLet $Q_{ZF}$ be the charge per unit volume associated with the zonal flow mode. This charge is related to the potential $\\phi$ through an effective capacitance $C$ of the plasma, $Q_{ZF} = C \\phi$. As the system is assumed to be isolated (no sources or sinks), $Q_{ZF}$ is conserved over time. Therefore, we have:\n$$ C(t=0^+) \\phi(t=0^+) = C(t \\to \\infty) \\phi(t \\to \\infty) $$\nThe initial potential is given as $\\phi_0$. The residual level is then the ratio of the initial to the final capacitance:\n$$ R_{\\text{RH}} = \\frac{\\phi_\\infty}{\\phi_0} = \\frac{C(t=0^+)}{C(t \\to \\infty)} $$\nThe problem thus reduces to determining the plasma's effective capacitance in the high-frequency limit ($t \\to 0^+$), which corresponds to the initial response, and in the zero-frequency limit ($t \\to \\infty$), which corresponds to the final relaxed state. The capacitance is determined by the plasma's polarization properties.\n\nThe total effective capacitance of the system is the sum of the classical and neoclassical contributions: $C(t) = C_{cl} + C_{neo}(t)$. The neoclassical contribution is time-dependent (or frequency-dependent) because it involves particle motion over orbital timescales.\n\n**1. High-Frequency Capacitance ($t \\to 0^+$)**\nIn the immediate aftermath of the potential being established ($t \\to 0^+$), the timescale is too short for particles to drift significantly or move along the magnetic field lines. The response is dominated by the rapid gyromotion of ions. This gives rise to the classical polarization current and charge density. The effective capacitance in this limit is purely the classical capacitance, $C(t=0^+) = C_{cl}$.\nThe classical ion polarization density $\\delta\\rho_{cl}$ for a perturbation with radial wavenumber $k_r$ is given by:\n$$ \\delta\\rho_{cl} = \\frac{n_0 m_i}{B^2} k_r^2 \\phi = \\frac{n_0 Z^2 e^2}{T_i} k_r^2 \\rho_{ti}^2 \\phi $$\nwhere $n_0$ is the ion density, $m_i$ the ion mass, $T_i$ the ion temperature, $B$ the magnetic field strength, $Z e$ the ion charge, and $\\rho_{ti} = \\sqrt{T_i/m_i}/\\Omega_{ci}$ is the thermal ion Larmor radius with $\\Omega_{ci} = ZeB/m_i$. The classical capacitance is the coefficient relating charge and potential:\n$$ C_{cl} \\propto \\frac{n_0 Z^2 e^2}{T_i} k_r^2 \\rho_{ti}^2 $$\n\n**2. Low-Frequency Capacitance ($t \\to \\infty$)**\nAs time progresses towards infinity ($t \\to \\infty$), the system relaxes to a new steady state. On these long timescales, particles have time to drift and transit or bounce along field lines. This leads to an additional, much larger polarization known as neoclassical polarization. The final capacitance is the sum of the classical and the fully developed neoclassical capacitance: $C(t \\to \\infty) = C_{cl} + C_{neo}$.\nNeoclassical polarization in the collisionless limit arises from the distinct orbital dynamics of trapped and passing ions in the toroidal magnetic geometry. Due to the conservation of canonical toroidal angular momentum, $P_\\zeta$, the flux-surface-averaged density of passing ions cannot change in response to a purely radial electric field. Consequently, passing ions do not contribute to the shielding of the zonal potential in the long-time limit.\nTrapped ions, however, are not constrained in the same way. Their banana-shaped orbits can undergo a radial drift in the presence of the zonal potential, leading to a significant charge separation. This effect constitutes the neoclassical polarization.\n\nWe can estimate the magnitude of the neoclassical capacitance relative to the classical one with a scaling argument. The polarization capacitance is proportional to the density of the polarizing particles and the square of their characteristic radial displacement or orbit size.\n- Classical capacitance is due to all ions (fraction $1$) with a characteristic radial scale of the Larmor radius $\\rho_i$: $C_{cl} \\propto n_0 \\rho_i^2$.\n- Neoclassical capacitance is due only to trapped ions. The fraction of trapped ions, $f_t$, in a large-aspect-ratio tokamak ($\\epsilon = r/R_0 \\ll 1$) is $f_t \\approx \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}$. The characteristic radial size of their orbits is the banana width, $\\Delta r_b$. For a deeply trapped particle, $\\Delta r_b \\approx \\frac{v_\\parallel}{\\Omega_{cp}} \\approx \\frac{q v_\\perp}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\Omega_{ci}} \\approx \\frac{q \\rho_i}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}$, where $\\Omega_{cp} = ZeB_p/m_i$ is the poloidal gyrofrequency and $q \\approx rB_t/RB_p$.\nThus, the neoclassical capacitance scales as:\n$$ C_{neo} \\propto n_0 f_t (\\Delta r_b)^2 \\approx n_0 \\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{q \\rho_i}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\right)^2 = n_0 \\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\frac{q^2 \\rho_i^2}{\\epsilon} = n_0 \\frac{q^2 \\rho_i^2}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} $$\nThe ratio of the neoclassical to classical capacitance is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{C_{neo}}{C_{cl}} \\propto \\frac{n_0 q^2 \\rho_i^2 / \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{n_0 \\rho_i^2} = \\frac{q^2}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} $$\nA full kinetic calculation over the ion distribution function is required to find the precise numerical coefficient. This calculation yields:\n$$ \\frac{C_{neo}}{C_{cl}} = c_0 \\frac{q^2}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} $$\nwhere the numerical constant $c_0 \\approx 1.63$. We will use the commonly cited value $c_0 = 1.6$ for this derivation.\n\n**3. Final Residual Level**\nThe residual zonal flow level is now found by substituting the expressions for the capacitance into the conservation relation:\n$$ R_{\\text{RH}} = \\frac{C_{cl}}{C_{cl} + C_{neo}} = \\frac{1}{1 + C_{neo}/C_{cl}} $$\n$$ R_{\\text{RH}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1.6 \\frac{q^2}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}} $$\n\n**4. Dependence on Magnetic Shear ($s$)**\nThe problem asks for the dependence on $q$, $\\epsilon$, and $s$. In the standard large-aspect-ratio, circular flux surface model, the leading-order expression for the collisionless neoclassical polarization does not depend on the magnetic shear $s$. The shear primarily affects the parallel connection length and can modify orbit topology, but its effect on the banana width and the trapped particle fraction is of higher order in $\\epsilon$. Therefore, in the limit considered, the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual is independent of $s$.\n\nThe final expression is thus a function of $q$ and $\\epsilon$ only.",

            "problem": "Consider electrostatic drift-wave turbulence interacting with axisymmetric zonal flows in a large-aspect-ratio tokamak. Treat the dynamics in a collisionless, radially local annulus where flux surfaces are nested and magnetic shear is weak. Work with normalized, dimensionless variables: let $Z(t)$ denote the zonal-flow amplitude (proportional to the $E \\times B$ shearing rate, normalized to a characteristic linear growth rate), and let $I(t)$ denote the turbulence intensity (normalized free energy density). Assume that the interaction is captured by energy-transfer arguments and mean-field closures that do not rely on geometry-specific shortcut formulas.\n\nAs a fundamental base, use the following widely accepted facts:\n- Zonal flows are driven by the divergence of the Reynolds stress (RS) of the turbulence, transferring free energy from the fluctuations into the mean flow. Denote the RS drive by a coefficient $\\,\\alpha>0\\,$ such that the instantaneous drive scales linearly with $\\,I\\,$.\n- Turbulence is quenched by $E \\times B$ shear with a suppression term that scales bilinearly in the zonal-flow amplitude and turbulence intensity, with coefficient $\\,\\eta>0\\,$.\n- Turbulence has an effective nonlinear self-damping (cascade) that scales like $\\,I^{2}\\,$ with coefficient $\\,\\beta>0\\,$, and a net linear drive $\\,\\gamma>0\\,$ from the background gradients.\n- Zonal flows experience geodesic curvature coupling to compressible motions known as the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM), which in the collisionless limit produces a transient relaxation. Due to the Rosenbluth–Hinton residual effect (Rosenbluth–Hinton (RH) residual), a finite fraction of the zonal flow persists after the GAM transient. Model this by introducing a residual response factor $\\,\\mathcal{R}\\in(0,1)\\,$ that multiplies the effective RS-to-zonal-flow transfer.

            "problem": "You are to implement a complete, runnable program that computes the residual level of axisymmetric zonal flow after linear collisionless relaxation in a large-aspect-ratio tokamak, known as the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual, by emulating a linearized initial-value approach in velocity space. The computational task targets Geodesic Acoustic Modes (GAM) in the geodesic-curvature-driven zonal flow relaxation problem with adiabatic electrons. The acronym definitions are: Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM) and Rosenbluth-Hinton (RH).\n\nThe computational base must follow from first principles of the linearized drift-kinetic description for ions, quasineutrality with adiabatic electrons, and energy-momentum conservation. The ions are assumed to have a Maxwellian background with thermal speed $v_{\\mathrm{th}}$ defined by $v_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{2 T_i / m_i}$ under normalized units with Boltzmann constant equal to $1$. The magnetic geometry is approximated by a circular, large-aspect-ratio tokamak with safety factor $q$, retaining the dominant geodesic curvature coupling. The radial wavenumber is assumed long-wavelength so that finite Larmor radius effects are negligible. The goal is to extract the long-time residual response of the zonal potential from the linearized initial-value system without time-stepping, by projecting onto the zero-frequency component implied by invariants of the linear operator.\n\nStarting from fundamental laws and core definitions:\n- Conservation of particles and momentum from the linearized drift-kinetic equation for ions in the presence of a zonal electric field $E_r(t)$, together with quasineutrality and adiabatic electron response.\n- The ion distribution function perturbation $g$ obeys phase mixing along field lines in the collisionless limit, while the zonal potential $\\varphi(t)$ evolves under polarization and parallel compressibility driven by geodesic curvature.\n- The asymptotic residual $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv \\varphi(\\infty)/\\varphi(0)$ arises from the projection onto the zero-frequency subspace of the linearized operator, and can be written purely as a velocity-space integral over a pitch-dependent geodesic weight that captures parallel compressibility.\n\nIn the large-aspect-ratio limit with circular flux surfaces, the leading-order geodesic curvature dependence of the parallel compressibility can be represented by a pitch-dependent weight $w(\\xi)$, where $\\xi \\equiv v_\\parallel / v$ is the pitch cosine. For a symmetric distribution of pitch, use $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$ and the geodesic weight model $w(\\xi) = 1 - \\xi^2/2$ to represent the dominant passing and trapped contributions to compressibility.

The pitch-angle integral over $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$ is likewise evaluated numerically using a specified number of pitch grid points $N_\\xi$.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case, constructs the $v_\\parallel$ and $\\xi$ grids, performs the numerical quadratures to estimate $\\mathcal{I}$, and then computes the residual $\\mathcal{R}$. This emulates extracting the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual from a linearized initial-value system via its zero-frequency invariant, and allows you to verify convergence with respect to the $v_\\parallel$ grid and the pitch resolution.\n\nUse normalized units with Boltzmann constant equal to $1$ throughout. No physical units appear in the final outputs; all outputs are dimensionless floats.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case 1 (happy path): $q = 1.5$, $N_{v_\\parallel} = 32$, $N_\\xi = 32$.\n- Case 2 (refined grid): $q = 1.5$, $N_{v_\\parallel} = 128$, $N_\\xi = 128$.\n- Case 3 (coarse grid, edge): $q = 1.5$, $N_{v_\\parallel} = 8$, $N_\\xi = 8$.\n- Case 4 (boundary condition): $q = 0.0$, $N_{v_\\parallel} = 32$, $N_\\xi = 32$.\n- Case 5 (larger $q$): $q = 2.5$, $N_{v_\\parallel} = 64$, $N_\\xi = 64$.\n- Case 6 (very large $q$, edge): $q = 5.0$, $N_{v_\\parallel} = 64$, $N_\\xi = 64$.\n\nFixed parameters used internally in the program to define the Maxwellian are $T_i = 1.0$ and $m_i = 1.0$, with the integration cutoff chosen as $L = \\alpha v_{\\mathrm{th}}$ with $\\alpha = 4.0$.
