The equation is valid in the leading edge of the front where $I \\ll 1$. The initial condition $I(r,0)$ is compactly supported.\n\nThis equation is a form of the Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov (FKPP) equation, which models the invasion of an unstable state ($I=0$) by a stable state. We seek a traveling wave solution that propagates with a constant speed $v_f$. Such a solution can be written in terms of a co-moving coordinate $\\xi = r - v_f t$, such that $I(r,t) = f(\\xi)$. The function $f(\\xi)$ represents the stationary profile of the wave in the frame moving with speed $v_f$.\n\nWe transform the partial differential equation (PDE) for $I(r,t)$ into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $f(\\xi)$.

At this leading edge, the turbulence intensity $I(r,t)$ is by definition very small, i.e., $I(r,t) \\to 0$. In this limit, the nonlinear saturation term, which is quadratic in $I$, becomes negligible compared to the linear terms.

Mechanism of Front Invasion**\nIn a linearly damped region, the parameter $\\gamma$ is positive. If the intensity $I$ is small, the dynamics are dominated by the linear term, $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} \\approx -\\gamma I$, which causes any small perturbation to decay exponentially. The state $I=0$ is linearly stable.\n\nHowever, a front can invade this stable region due to the interplay between diffusion and nonlinearity. A traveling front is a solution that connects a region of high turbulence intensity, say $I=I_{+}$, to the turbulence-free region $I=0$. The diffusion term, $D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} I}{\\partial r^{2}}$, transports turbulence energy from the high-intensity region into the leading edge of the front where $I$ is small. This diffusive influx can raise the local value of $I$ to a point where the nonlinear \"source\" terms, $\\mu I^2 - \\nu I^3$, overcome the linear damping term $-\\gamma I$. For this to happen, the reaction term $f(I)$ must become positive. The roots of $f(I)=0$ determine the thresholds for this behavior. As will be shown, under certain conditions, there exists an unstable threshold $I_{-}$ such that for $I > I_{-}$, $f(I) > 0$. If diffusion raises $I$ above this threshold $I_{-}$, the intensity will locally grow towards the high-intensity stable state $I_{+}$. This process, where diffusion from the front \"ignites\" the nonlinear growth ahead of it, allows the front to propagate in a self-sustaining manner into the linearly stable region.\n\n**2. Bistability Condition and the Finite Amplitude State $I_{+}$**\nBistability refers to the existence of two stable, homogeneous steady states. Homogeneous steady states are solutions where $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} = 0$ and spatial derivatives are zero. The governing equation reduces to the algebraic equation $f(I)=0$:\n$$\n-\\gamma I + \\mu I^2 - \\nu I^3 = 0\n$$\n$$\nI(-\\gamma + \\mu I - \\nu I^2) = 0\n$$\nOne solution is the trivial state $I_0 = 0$. Other solutions are the roots of the quadratic equation $\\nu I^2 - \\mu I + \\gamma = 0$:\n$$\nI_{\\pm} = \\frac{\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma}}{2\\nu}\n$$\nFor these roots to be real and distinct, the discriminant must be positive: $\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma > 0$, which implies $0 < \\gamma < \\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\nu}$. Since $\\mu, \\nu, \\gamma$ are all positive, both roots $I_{-}$ and $I_{+}$ are positive when they are real.\n\nTo determine stability, we analyze the sign of the derivative $f'(I)$ at each fixed point. A fixed point $I_*$ is stable if $f'(I_*) < 0$.\n$$\nf'(I) = -\\gamma + 2\\mu I - 3\\nu I^2\n$$\n- At $I_0 = 0$: $f'(0) = -\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma > 0$, $f'(0) < 0$, so the $I_0=0$ state is always stable.\n- At $I_{\\pm}$: We use the fact that $\\gamma = \\mu I_{\\pm} - \\nu I_{\\pm}^2$. Substituting this into $f'(I_{\\pm})$:\n$$\nf'(I_{\\pm}) = -(\\mu I_{\\pm} - \\nu I_{\\pm}^2) + 2\\mu I_{\\pm} - 3\\nu I_{\\pm}^2 = \\mu I_{\\pm} - 2\\nu I_{\\pm}^2 = I_{\\pm}(\\mu - 2\\nu I_{\\pm})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{\\pm}$:\n$$\n\\mu - 2\\nu I_{\\pm} = \\mu - 2\\nu \\left( \\frac{\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma}}{2\\nu} \\right) = \\mu - (\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma}) = \\mp\\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma}\n$$\nTherefore, $f'(I_{+}) = I_{+}(-\\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma}) < 0$ and $f'(I_{-}) = I_{-}(+\\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4\\nu\\gamma}) > 0$.\n\nThus, $I_{+}$ is a stable fixed point and $I_{-}$ is an unstable fixed point. Bistability, the coexistence of two stable states ($I_0=0$ and $I=I_{+}>0$), occurs when $I_{+}$ exists as a real, positive, and distinct root from $I_0$.
