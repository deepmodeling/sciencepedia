Substituting into Poisson’s equation gives\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\phi}{\\lambda_D^2},\\quad \\text{with}\\quad \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} = \\sum_s \\frac{n_{s0} q_s^2}{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_s}.\n$$\nFor a single dominant screening species of charge magnitude $e$ and temperature $T$, this reduces to $1/\\lambda_D^2 \\approx n e^2/(\\varepsilon_0 k_B T)$, i.e.,\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T}{n e^2}}.\n$$\nThe number of particles within the Debye sphere is defined by\n$$\nN_D = n \\cdot \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\lambda_D^3.\n$$\nThe mean interparticle spacing $a$ is defined by $(4\\pi/3) a^3 n = 1$, so $a = \\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi n}\\right)^{1/3}$ and one sees immediately that\n$$\nN_D = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_D}{a}\\right)^3.\n$$\nThus, $N_D \\sim 1$ implies $\\lambda_D \\sim a$, i.e., the screening length is comparable to the interparticle spacing. When $N_D \\ll 1$, there are fewer than one particle within a Debye sphere, and there is no meaningful collective rearrangement: screening becomes ineffective and many-body correlation effects dominate.\n\nIt is also useful to connect $N_D$ to the Coulomb coupling parameter $\\Gamma$, which compares mean Coulomb potential energy to thermal energy,\n$$\n\\Gamma \\equiv \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 a k_B T}.\n$$\nUsing $a = (3/(4\\pi n))^{1/3}$ and $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T/(n e^2)}$, we can derive a universal relation for singly charged species. First write\n$$\nN_D = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} n \\lambda_D^3 = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\, n \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T}{n e^2}\\right)^{3/2} \n= \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\, \\varepsilon_0^{3/2} (k_B T)^{3/2} n^{-1/2} e^{-3},\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\Gamma^{3/2} \n= \\left(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi n}{3}\\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nMultiplying yields\n$$\nN_D \\Gamma^{3/2} \n= \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right) \\varepsilon_0^{3/2} (k_B T)^{3/2} n^{-1/2} e^{-3} \n\\cdot \\left(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi n}{3}\\right)^{1/2}\n= \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{3/2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nN_D = 3^{-3/2}\\, \\Gamma^{-3/2} \\approx 0.19245\\, \\Gamma^{-3/2}.\n$$\nThis shows that $N_D \\sim 1$ corresponds to $\\Gamma \\sim 1/3$, and that for strongly coupled plasmas with $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$, one has $N_D \\ll 1$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\nOption A:\nThis statement asserts that in white dwarf interiors, ions are strongly coupled ($\\Gamma_i \\gtrsim 1$), $N_D \\lesssim 1$, collective behavior breaks down, and screening is dominated by correlations and degenerate electrons (Thomas–Fermi screening). Let us estimate $\\Gamma_i$ for representative ion parameters $n_i \\sim 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $T_i \\sim 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The mean spacing is\n$$\na = \\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi n_i}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx \\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi \\times 10^{35}}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 1.34 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}.\n$$\nThe Coulomb energy scale is $e^2/(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0) \\approx 2.3067 \\times 10^{-28}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m}$, and $k_B T \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{J}$ at $T=10^6\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Hence\n$$\n\\Gamma_i \\approx \\frac{2.3067 \\times 10^{-28}}{(1.34 \\times 10^{-12})(1.38 \\times 10^{-17})} \\approx 12.5,\n$$\nso $\\Gamma_i \\gg 1$. Using $N_D \\approx 0.19245\\, \\Gamma^{-3/2}$,\n$$\nN_D \\approx 0.19245 \\times (12.5)^{-3/2} \\approx 4.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\ll 1.\n$$\nThus the ionic component has $N_D \\ll 1$ and is strongly coupled; mean-field Debye shielding is invalid, and electron screening arises from degeneracy (Thomas–Fermi). The physical characterization is correct. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B:\nSolar wind near $1\\,\\mathrm{AU}$ with $n_e \\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $T_e \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Converting $n_e$ to SI, $n_e \\approx 5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. Using\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}},\n$$\nwith $k_B T_e \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$, we get\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(8.854 \\times 10^{-12})(1.602 \\times 10^{-18})}{(5 \\times 10^6)(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}} \n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1.418 \\times 10^{-29}}{1.283 \\times 10^{-31}}} \\approx \\sqrt{110.5} \\approx 10.5\\,\\mathrm{m}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nN_D = n_e \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\lambda_D^3 \\approx (5 \\times 10^6)\\times \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\times (10.5)^3 \\approx 2.4 \\times 10^{10}.\n$$\nThis is $\\gg 1$, indicating robust collective behavior and effective Debye shielding. The claim $N_D \\sim 1$ and breakdown of collective effects is incorrect. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C:\nNeutron star crust with $n_i \\sim 10^{36}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$ and $T \\sim 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$, electrons degenerate. Estimating the ionic $\\Gamma$,\n$$\na \\approx \\left(\\frac{3}{4\\pi \\times 10^{36}}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 6.18 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m},\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\Gamma_i \\approx \\frac{2.3067 \\times 10^{-28}}{(6.18 \\times 10^{-13})(1.38 \\times 10^{-17})} \\approx 27.1,\n$$\nso\n$$\nN_D \\approx 0.19245 \\times (27.1)^{-3/2} \\approx 1.36 \\times 10^{-3} \\ll 1.\n$$\nThus the ionic component is strongly coupled with $N_D \\lesssim 1$ (indeed $\\ll 1$). Classical Debye shielding does not apply; screening is governed by degenerate electrons (Thomas–Fermi screening) and strong ion correlations. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption D:\nDiffuse intergalactic medium with $n_e \\sim 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $T_e \\sim 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Convert $n_e$ to SI: $n_e \\approx 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. Compute\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(8.854 \\times 10^{-12})(1.38 \\times 10^{-23})(10^{6})}{(10)(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}} \n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1.221 \\times 10^{-28}}{2.566 \\times 10^{-37}}} \\approx \\sqrt{4.758 \\times 10^{8}} \\approx 2.18 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}.\n$$\nThen\n$$\nN_D = n_e \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\lambda_D^3 \\approx 10 \\times \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\times (2.18 \\times 10^4)^3 \\approx 4.36 \\times 10^{14}.\n$$\nThis is $\\gg 1$, so collective behavior is extraordinarily robust; the claim $N_D \\ll 1$ is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption E:\nThe statement claims that when $N_D \\sim 1$, $\\lambda_D  a$ and screening efficiency increases. From the exact relation $N_D = (\\lambda_D/a)^3$, $N_D \\sim 1$ implies $\\lambda_D \\sim a$, not $\\lambda_D  a$, and smaller $N_D$ corresponds to $\\lambda_D  a$. Moreover, decreasing $N_D$ reduces the number of particles available to rearrange within a screening volume, making screening less effective, not more. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption F:\nWhen $N_D \\sim 1$, one has $\\lambda_D \\sim a$ and, via $N_D \\Gamma^{3/2} = 3^{-3/2}$, $\\Gamma \\sim 1/3$. This indicates the mean Coulomb potential energy is a significant fraction of $k_B T$. As $N_D$ decreases further ($\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$), strong coupling sets in: binary collisions and many-body correlations dominate, and the collisionless Boltzmann (Vlasov) description without collision terms ceases to be reliable. Screening is ineffective beyond short-range correlations, and mean-field Debye shielding breaks down. This statement correctly captures the physics of the breakdown. Verdict: Correct.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are A, C, and F. The solar wind and intergalactic medium have $N_D \\gg 1$ and exhibit robust collective behavior with effective Debye shielding, whereas dense, relatively cold ionic matter in compact object interiors exhibits $N_D \\lesssim 1$ or $\\ll 1$, strong coupling, and ineffective classical screening.",
