This practice  moves from theory to computation, challenging you to implement the fundamental \"realizability conditions\" that any set of moments must satisfy. By developing a program to test these inequalities, you gain a crucial skill for validating fluid models and interpreting data from kinetic simulations.",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, non-relativistic astrophysical plasma characterized by a velocity distribution function $f(v)$ that is non-negative and integrable over all real velocities $v$. Let the number density $n$, the bulk velocity $u$, and the central moments be defined by the fundamental moment integrals\n$$\nn = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(v)\\, dv,\\qquad\nu = \\frac{1}{n}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v\\, f(v)\\, dv,\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (v - u)^k\\, f(v)\\, dv,\\qquad k\\in\\{2,3,4\\}.\n$$\nThe quantity $\\mu_2$ is the second central moment and equals the squared thermal speed $\\Theta$ given by $\\Theta = \\mu_2$. The third central moment $\\mu_3$ is related to the heat flux density in the one-dimensional frame (up to multiplicative physical constants not needed for this purely mathematical verification task), and the fourth central moment $\\mu_4$ characterizes the kurtosis of the distribution.\n\nIn the kinetic moment hierarchy derived from the Vlasov equation (or from the Boltzmann equation without collisions for collisionless dynamics), closures are required to express higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones. This problem focuses on the numerical realizability and verification of such closures based on necessary inequalities implied by the non-negativity of $f(v)$ and on the signature of the Maximum Entropy (ME) closure. Maximum Entropy (ME) refers to the closure that maximizes the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy subject to constraints on $n$, $u$, and $\\Theta$, which yields a Gaussian (Maxwellian) in velocity.\n\nYou must write a program that, for each provided test case, takes $(n, u, \\Theta, \\mu_3, \\mu_4)$ as input and returns two boolean outputs:\n- The first boolean $B_{\\mathrm{real}}$ verifies general numerical realizability of the moment set by checking:\n  1. Positivity constraints: $n > 0$ and $\\Theta > 0$.\n  2. The Cauchy–Schwarz-type inequality implied by the non-negativity of $f(v)$: $\\mu_4 \\ge \\mu_2^2$.\n  3. The mixed-moment Cauchy–Schwarz bound: $\\lvert \\mu_3 \\rvert \\le \\sqrt{\\mu_4\\, \\mu_2}$.\n\n- The second boolean $B_{\\mathrm{ME}}$ verifies ME-closure consistency, defined as the moment relations characteristic of a Maxwellian: $\\mu_3 = 0$ and $\\mu_4 = 3\\, \\mu_2^2$. In practice, numerical floating-point comparisons must use a small tolerance.\n\nScientific and unit requirements:\n- All inputs and computed quantities must be treated in the following units: $n$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $u$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\Theta$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^2$, $\\mu_3$ in $\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}^3$, and $\\mu_4$ in $\\mathrm{m}^4/\\mathrm{s}^4$.\n- All comparisons requiring equality should use a relative tolerance appropriate for floating-point arithmetic.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement your program for the following six test cases. Each test case is a tuple $(n, u, \\Theta, \\mu_3, \\mu_4)$ with values in the specified units.\n\n1. Typical Maxwellian, realistic astrophysical values:\n   - $n = 10^6$, $u = 3\\times 10^4$, $\\Theta = 10^8$, $\\mu_3 = 0$, $\\mu_4 = 3\\times (10^8)^2 = 3\\times 10^{16}$.\n\n2.

Non-Maxwellian but realizable (moderate kurtosis, non-zero skewness within bounds):\n   - $n = 10^6$, $u = 10^3$, $\\Theta = 10^6$, $\\mu_4 = 2\\times (10^6)^2 = 2\\times 10^{12}$, $\\mu_3 = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\mu_4\\, \\Theta} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2\\times 10^{18}}$.\n\n4.

Unrealizable due to excessive skewness violating the Cauchy–Schwarz bound:\n   - $n = 10^6$, $u = 0$, $\\Theta = 10^8$, $\\mu_4 = 3\\times (10^8)^2 = 3\\times 10^{16}$, $\\mu_3 = 2\\sqrt{\\mu_4\\, \\Theta} = 2\\sqrt{3\\times 10^{24}}$.\n\n6.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics, specifically the moment method for solving the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation. The definitions of the number density $n$, bulk velocity $u$, and central moments $\\mu_k$ are standard. The realizability conditions are necessary consequences of the non-negativity of the distribution function $f(v)$, and the Maximum Entropy (ME) closure conditions correctly specify the properties of a Maxwellian distribution. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to develop a computational procedure to validate sets of moments $(n, u, \\Theta, \\mu_3, \\mu_4)$ against two distinct criteria: general numerical realizability, $B_{\\mathrm{real}}$, and consistency with a Maximum Entropy (Maxwellian) closure, $B_{\\mathrm{ME}}$. Given that $\\Theta = \\mu_2$, we will use $\\Theta$ in the expressions for consistency.\n\nFirst, we address the general numerical realizability, represented by the boolean $B_{\\mathrm{real}}$. A set of moments is realizable if there could exist at least one non-negative distribution function $f(v) \\ge 0$ that would produce these moments. This imposes several mathematical constraints that must be satisfied.\n\n1.  **Positivity Constraints**: The number density $n$ must be positive, $n > 0$, as it represents a count of particles per unit volume. The thermal speed squared, $\\Theta = \\mu_2$, represents the variance of the velocity distribution. For any distribution that is not a Dirac delta function, this variance must be strictly positive, $\\Theta > 0$. A value of $\\Theta = 0$ corresponds to a \"cold\" plasma where all particles have the same velocity $u$, but the problem specifies $\\Theta > 0$.\n\n2.  **Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality for Kurtosis**: The condition $\\mu_4 \\ge \\mu_2^2$ is a fundamental statistical inequality. Let $X = v-u$ be a random variable with probability density proportional to $f(v)$. Its mean is $E[X] = \\mu_1 = 0$. The central moments are $\\mu_k = E[X^k]$. The inequality can be written as $E[X^4] \\ge (E[X^2])^2$. This is a direct consequence of Jensen's inequality for the convex function $\\phi(z) = z^2$ applied to the random variable $Y = X^2$: $E[Y^2] \\ge (E[Y])^2$. It can also be seen as stating that the variance of $X^2$ is non-negative: $\\mathrm{Var}(X^2) = E[(X^2)^2] - (E[X^2])^2 = \\mu_4 - \\mu_2^2 \\ge 0$. Substituting $\\Theta$ for $\\mu_2$, this condition is $\\mu_4 \\ge \\Theta^2$.\n\n3.  **Mixed-Moment Cauchy–Schwarz Bound**: The condition $\\lvert \\mu_3 \\rvert \\le \\sqrt{\\mu_4\\, \\mu_2}$ arises from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied to an inner product space where functions are weighted by $f(v)$. Consider the inner product $\\langle g, h \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(v) h(v) f(v) dv$. Let $g(v) = (v-u)$ and $h(v) = (v-u)^2$. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states $\\lvert \\langle g, h \\rangle \\rvert^2 \\le \\langle g, g \\rangle \\langle h, h \\rangle$. This translates to:\n    $$\n    \\left| \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (v-u)^3 f(v) dv \\right|^2 \\le \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (v-u)^2 f(v) dv \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (v-u)^4 f(v) dv \\right)\n    $$\n    Dividing by $n^2$, we obtain $(\\mu_3 n)^2 \\le (\\mu_2 n)(\\mu_4 n)$, which simplifies to $\\mu_3^2 \\le \\mu_2 \\mu_4$. Taking the square root gives $|\\mu_3| \\le \\sqrt{\\mu_2 \\mu_4}$. With $\\Theta = \\mu_2$, the condition is $|\\mu_3| \\le \\sqrt{\\mu_4 \\Theta}$.\n\nThe boolean $B_{\\mathrm{real}}$ is the logical conjunction of these three conditions:\n$B_{\\mathrm{real}} = (n > 0) \\land (\\Theta > 0) \\land (\\mu_4 \\ge \\Theta^2) \\land (|\\mu_3| \\le \\sqrt{\\mu_4 \\Theta})$.\n\nSecond, we address the consistency with the Maximum Entropy (ME) closure, represented by the boolean $B_{\\mathrm{ME}}$. The ME principle states that, given a set of constraints, the most likely distribution is the one that maximizes the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy $S = -\\int f(v) \\ln f(v) dv$. When the constraints are fixed values for $n$, $u$, and $\\Theta$, the resulting distribution is a Gaussian, or Maxwellian:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{M}}(v) = n \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\Theta} \\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(v-u)^2}{2\\Theta}\\right)\n$$\nThe moments of this specific distribution must satisfy certain relationships.\n\n1.  **Skewness**: The Gaussian distribution is symmetric about its mean $u$. Consequently, all its odd central moments are zero. In particular, the third central moment, related to skewness, must be zero: $\\mu_3 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Kurtosis**: The even central moments of a Gaussian with variance $\\Theta$ are given by $\\mu_{2k} = \\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!} \\Theta^k$. For the fourth central moment ($k=2$), this yields $\\mu_4 = \\frac{4!}{2^2 2!} \\Theta^2 = \\frac{24}{8} \\Theta^2 = 3\\Theta^2 = 3\\mu_2^2$.\n\nThe boolean $B_{\\mathrm{ME}}$ is the logical conjunction of these two specific equalities. As these are checks for equality between floating-point numbers, a numerical tolerance is required. We use a standard relative tolerance $r_{tol}$ and absolute tolerance $a_{tol}$ to check if two numbers $a$ and $b$ are close, i.e., $|a-b| \\le a_{tol} + r_{tol} |b|$.\n$B_{\\mathrm{ME}} = (\\mathrm{isclose}(\\mu_3, 0)) \\land (\\mathrm{isclose}(\\mu_4, 3\\Theta^2))$.\n\nThe final implementation will process each test case by sequentially applying these two sets of checks to generate the pair of booleans $[B_{\\mathrm{real}}, B_{\\mathrm{ME}}]$.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in theoretical plasma physics. I will now proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Derivation\nThe goal is to find the closure coefficient $C(\\kappa)$ from the relation $\\langle v^{4} \\rangle = C(\\kappa)\\,\\langle v^{2} \\rangle^{2}$. This can be rewritten as:\n$$\nC(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\langle v^{4} \\rangle}{\\langle v^{2} \\rangle^{2}}\n$$\nWe must first compute the second and fourth velocity moments, $\\langle v^{2} \\rangle$ and $\\langle v^{4} \\rangle$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the $m$-th moment is:\n$$\n\\langle v^{m} \\rangle = \\frac{4\\pi}{n}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{m+2}\\,f(v)\\,dv\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f(v)$ gives:\n$$\n\\langle v^{m} \\rangle = \\frac{4\\pi A}{n}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{m+2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\,\\theta^{2}}\\right)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dv\n$$\nThe normalization condition is $n = 4\\pi A \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\,\\theta^{2}}\\right)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dv$.\nWe can express the ratio $\\frac{4\\pi A}{n}$ as:\n$$\n\\frac{4\\pi A}{n} = \\frac{1}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\,\\theta^{2}}\\right)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dv}\n$$\nTherefore, the moment $\\langle v^m \\rangle$ can be written as a ratio of integrals, which conveniently eliminates the normalization constant $A$:\n$$\n\\langle v^{m} \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{m+2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\,\\theta^{2}}\\right)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dv}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\,\\theta^{2}}\\right)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dv}\n$$\nLet us define a general integral $J_{p}$ as:\n$$\nJ_{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{p} \\left(1 + \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\,\\theta^{2}}\\right)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dv\n$$\nIn terms of these integrals, the moments are:\n$$\n\\langle v^{2} \\rangle = \\frac{J_{4}}{J_{2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle v^{4} \\rangle = \\frac{J_{6}}{J_{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $C(\\kappa)$:\n$$\nC(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\langle v^{4} \\rangle}{\\langle v^{2} \\rangle^{2}} = \\frac{J_{6}/J_{2}}{(J_{4}/J_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{J_{6} J_{2}}{J_{4}^{2}}\n$$\nTo evaluate $J_{p}$, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = \\frac{v^{2}}{\\kappa \\theta^{2}}$.\nThen $v^{2} = \\kappa \\theta^{2} x$, which implies $v = \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\theta x^{1/2}$.\nThe differential is $dv = \\sqrt{\\kappa} \\theta \\frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} dx$.\nThe integral $J_p$ becomes:\n$$\nJ_{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\theta x^{1/2})^{p} (1+x)^{-(\\kappa+1)} \\left(\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\theta \\frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\nJ_{p} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{\\kappa} \\theta)^{p+1}}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{p/2} x^{-1/2} (1+x)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dx\n$$\n$$\nJ_{p} = \\frac{(\\kappa \\theta^{2})^{(p+1)/2}}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{(p-1)/2} (1+x)^{-(\\kappa+1)} dx\n$$\nThe integral is a representation of the Beta function, $B(z_{1}, z_{2}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z_{1}-1} (1+t)^{-(z_{1}+z_{2})} dt$.\nBy comparison, we set $z_{1}-1 = \\frac{p-1}{2}$, which gives $z_{1} = \\frac{p+1}{2}$.\nAnd $z_{1}+z_{2} = \\kappa+1$, which gives $z_{2} = \\kappa+1 - z_{1} = \\kappa+1 - \\frac{p+1}{2} = \\kappa - \\frac{p-1}{2}$.\nThe integral converges for $z_{1} > 0$ and $z_{2} > 0$. The condition $z_2 > 0$ requires $\\kappa > \\frac{p-1}{2}$. For $p=6$, this is $\\kappa > \\frac{5}{2}$, which is precisely the condition given in the problem statement, confirming the problem is well-posed.\n\nSo, $J_{p}$ is given by:\n$$\nJ_{p} = \\frac{(\\kappa \\theta^{2})^{(p+1)/2}}{2} B\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}, \\kappa - \\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the relation $B(z_{1}, z_{2}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(z_{1})\\Gamma(z_{2})}{\\Gamma(z_{1}+z_{2})}$, we get:\n$$\nJ_{p} = \\frac{(\\kappa \\theta^{2})^{(p+1)/2}}{2} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\kappa+1)}\n$$\nNow we can form the ratio for $C(\\kappa) = \\frac{J_{6} J_{2}}{J_{4}^{2}}$. The prefactors involving $\\kappa$ and $\\theta$ will cancel:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\kappa\\theta^2)^{(6+1)/2} (\\kappa\\theta^2)^{(2+1)/2}}{[(\\kappa\\theta^2)^{(4+1)/2}]^2} = \\frac{(\\kappa\\theta^2)^{7/2} (\\kappa\\theta^2)^{3/2}}{(\\kappa\\theta^2)^{10/2}} = \\frac{(\\kappa\\theta^2)^{10/2}}{(\\kappa\\theta^2)^{5}}=1\n$$\nThe factor of $1/2$ and $\\Gamma(\\kappa+1)$ in each $J_p$ term also cancels in the ratio:\n$$\nC(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\left[\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\right] \\left[\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\kappa-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right]}{\\left[\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right]^{2}}\n$$\nWe simplify this expression using the recurrence relation of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)$.\nLet's group the terms:\n$$\nC(\\kappa) = \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{7}{2})\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2})^{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2})^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we simplify the constant part involving numerical arguments:\n$\\Gamma(\\frac{7}{2}) = \\frac{5}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2})$\n$\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2}) = \\frac{3}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2})$\nSo, $\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{7}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2})} = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{2})} = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2})}{\\frac{3}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2})} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe constant part is $(\\frac{5}{2})(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nNext, we simplify the $\\kappa$-dependent part:\n$\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{1}{2}) = (\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2})\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2})$\n$\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2}) = (\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})$\nSo, $\\frac{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{1}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2})} = \\kappa-\\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\frac{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2})} = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})}{(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})\\Gamma(\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2})} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2}}$.\nThe $\\kappa$-dependent part is $(\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2})(\\frac{1}{\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2}}) = \\frac{\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2}}{\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2}}$.\n\nCombining both parts, we get:\n$$\nC(\\kappa) = \\frac{5}{3} \\frac{\\kappa-\\frac{3}{2}}{\\kappa-\\frac{5}{2}}\n$$\nTo present this in a more elegant form, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $2$:\n$$\nC(\\kappa) = \\frac{5}{3} \\frac{2\\kappa-3}{2\\kappa-5}\n$$\nAs a final check, in the limit $\\kappa \\to \\infty$, the kappa distribution approaches a Maxwellian distribution. For a Maxwellian, it is known that $\\langle v^4 \\rangle / \\langle v^2 \\rangle^2 = 15/9 = 5/3$.\nOur result gives $\\lim_{\\kappa \\to \\infty} C(\\kappa) = \\lim_{\\kappa \\to \\infty} \\frac{5}{3} \\frac{2\\kappa-3}{2\\kappa-5} = \\frac{5}{3} \\lim_{\\kappa \\to \\infty} \\frac{2-3/\\kappa}{2-5/\\kappa} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\nThe result correctly reproduces the Maxwellian limit, which provides confidence in the derivation.",

The model is given by $q_{\\parallel}(s) \\approx - \\chi \\, \\partial_s T_{\\parallel}(s) - \\beta \\, T_{\\parallel}(s) \\, \\partial_s u_{\\parallel}(s)$. The dataset consists of $M$ samples, where for each sample $i$, we have the measured heat flux $Q_i = q_{\\parallel}(s_i)$, and the regressors $A_i = \\partial_s T_{\\parallel}(s_i)$ and $B_i = T_{\\parallel}(s_i) \\, \\partial_s u_{\\parallel}(s_i)$, along with a positive weight $w_i$.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the values of $\\chi$ and $\\beta$ that best fit the model to the data. The \"best fit\" is defined in the sense of weighted least squares. We first construct the objective function, which is the weighted sum of squared residuals, $\\mathcal{L}(\\chi, \\beta)$. The model's prediction for the heat flux at sample $i$ is $\\hat{Q}_i = - \\chi A_i - \\beta B_i$. The residual for sample $i$ is the difference between the measured value $Q_i$ and the predicted value $\\hat{Q}_i$:\n$$\nr_i = Q_i - \\hat{Q}_i = Q_i - (-\\chi A_i - \\beta B_i) = Q_i + \\chi A_i + \\beta B_i\n$$\nThe weighted least-squares criterion seeks to minimize the sum of the squares of these residuals, with each term weighted by $w_i$.
