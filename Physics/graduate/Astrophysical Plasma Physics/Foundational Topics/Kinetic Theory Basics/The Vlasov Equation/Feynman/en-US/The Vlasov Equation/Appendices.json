A crucial skill for any plasma physicist is the ability to connect this microscopic description to the macroscopic, fluid-like quantities we can observe, such as density, temperature, and pressure. This exercise bridges this gap by having you calculate the scalar pressure from a given Maxwellian distribution, a fundamental calculation in kinetic theory . Furthermore, it pushes you to consider the real-world applicability of the Vlasov model by identifying the physical conditions under which a collisionless description is valid for an astrophysical plasma like the solar wind.",

            "problem": "In astrophysical plasma physics, the collisionless kinetic description employs the Vlasov equation, which governs the evolution of the single-particle distribution function under self-consistent electromagnetic fields while neglecting binary collisions. Consider a stationary, spatially homogeneous proton population in the solar wind modeled by an isotropic Maxwellian distribution\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\;=\\; n_{0}\\,(\\pi\\,v_{th}^{2})^{-3/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{v^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $n_{0}$ is the number density, $m$ is the proton mass, and $v_{th}$ is the thermal speed parameter. Starting from the kinetic-theory definition of scalar pressure as the isotropic second velocity moment of the distribution function, derive the scalar pressure $p$ of this Maxwellian in terms of $m$, $n_{0}$, and $v_{th}$, and express the result as a single closed-form analytic expression. Then, based on the collisionless Vlasov description, identify the minimal set of physical assumptions on collisionality and characteristic scales under which this collisionless treatment remains valid for the expanding solar wind near one Astronomical Unit (AU). No numerical evaluation is required, and no units need to be reported in the final expression; provide the pressure symbolically.",
            "solution": "The problem requires two distinct tasks: first, to derive the scalar pressure $p$ for a proton population described by an isotropic Maxwellian distribution function, and second, to identify the physical assumptions that validate the use of the collisionless Vlasov equation for the expanding solar wind.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the scalar pressure $p$.\nThe general definition of the pressure tensor, $\\mathbf{P}$, for a particle species of mass $m$ is given by the second central moment of its distribution function $f(\\boldsymbol{v})$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} = m \\int (\\boldsymbol{v} - \\boldsymbol{u})(\\boldsymbol{v} - \\boldsymbol{u}) f(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\, d^3v\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is the mean (bulk) velocity of the population, defined as $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\frac{1}{n} \\int \\boldsymbol{v} f(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\, d^3v$, with $n = \\int f(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\, d^3v$ being the number density.\n\nThe given distribution function is\n$$\nf(\\boldsymbol{v}) = n_{0}\\,(\\pi\\,v_{th}^{2})^{-3/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{v^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $v = |\\boldsymbol{v}|$. This function is isotropic, meaning it depends only on the magnitude of the velocity, not its direction. It is also an even function of the velocity vector components, i.e., $f(-\\boldsymbol{v}) = f(\\boldsymbol{v})$. The mean velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is calculated by integrating $\\boldsymbol{v}f(\\boldsymbol{v})$ over all of velocity space. Since the integrand $\\boldsymbol{v}f(\\boldsymbol{v})$ is an odd function of $\\boldsymbol{v}$, its integral over the symmetric domain of all velocity space is zero. Thus, the bulk velocity is $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This corresponds to the problem's description of a \"stationary\" population (in its own reference frame).\n\nWith $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, the pressure tensor simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} = m \\int \\boldsymbol{v}\\boldsymbol{v} f(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\, d^3v\n$$\nThe problem asks for the scalar pressure $p$. For an isotropic distribution, the pressure tensor is diagonal and its diagonal components are equal: $P_{xx} = P_{yy} = P_{zz} = p$. The scalar pressure is conventionally defined as one-third of the trace of the pressure tensor:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{P}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P_{ii}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the components of $\\mathbf{P}$:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3} m \\int (v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2) f(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\, d^3v = \\frac{m}{3} \\int v^2 f(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\, d^3v\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given Maxwellian distribution for $f(\\boldsymbol{v})$:\n$$\np = \\frac{m}{3} \\int v^2 \\left( n_{0}\\,(\\pi\\,v_{th}^{2})^{-3/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{v^{2}}{v_{th}^{2}}\\right) \\right) \\, d^3v\n$$\nWe can pull the constants out of the integral:\n$$\np = \\frac{m n_{0}}{3} (\\pi v_{th}^2)^{-3/2} \\int v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\, d^3v\n$$\nThe integrand is spherically symmetric. Therefore, we can evaluate the integral in spherical velocity coordinates, where the volume element is $d^3v = 4\\pi v^2 dv$:\n$$\n\\int v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\, d^3v = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) (4\\pi v^2) \\, dv = 4\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^4 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\, dv\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{2n} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^{n+1} a^n} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. In our case, $x=v$, $n=2$, and $a=1/v_{th}^2$.\nThe double factorial is $(2(2)-1)!! = 3!! = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$.\nSo, the integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^4 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v^2}{v_{th}^2}\\right) \\, dv = \\frac{3!!}{2^{2+1} (1/v_{th}^2)^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/v_{th}^2}} = \\frac{3}{8 v_{th}^{-4}} \\sqrt{\\pi v_{th}^2} = \\frac{3}{8} v_{th}^4 \\cdot v_{th} \\sqrt{\\pi} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\pi}}{8} v_{th}^5\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the pressure:\n$$\np = \\frac{m n_{0}}{3} (\\pi v_{th}^2)^{-3/2} \\left[ 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\pi}}{8} v_{th}^5 \\right) \\right]\n$$\nLet's simplify the constants and powers of $\\pi$ and $v_{th}$:\n$$\np = \\left(\\frac{m n_{0}}{3}\\right) \\left(\\pi^{-3/2} v_{th}^{-3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{12\\pi \\sqrt{\\pi}}{8} v_{th}^5\\right)\n$$\nThe numerical factors are $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe powers of $\\pi$ are $\\pi^{-3/2} \\cdot \\pi^1 \\cdot \\pi^{1/2} = \\pi^{-3/2+1+1/2} = \\pi^0 = 1$.\nThe powers of $v_{th}$ are $v_{th}^{-3} \\cdot v_{th}^5 = v_{th}^2$.\nCombining these terms yields the final expression for the scalar pressure:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{2} m n_{0} v_{th}^2\n$$\n\nSecond, we identify the minimal set of physical assumptions under which the collisionless Vlasov treatment is valid for the expanding solar wind near one Astronomical Unit (AU).\nThe Vlasov equation describes the dynamics of a distribution function under the influence of smooth, long-range, self-consistent electromagnetic fields, while explicitly neglecting the effects of short-range particle-particle interactions (collisions). The term \"collisionless\" is an approximation whose validity depends on the separation of physical scales. The minimal set of assumptions can be stated as follows:\n\n1.  **Scale Separation of Lengths**: The characteristic length scale of the plasma phenomena being studied, $L_{char}$, must be much smaller than the mean free path for binary collisions, $\\lambda_{mfp}$. For the large-scale structure of the expanding solar wind, the characteristic length is the scale over which macroscopic quantities (like density or temperature) vary significantly. This scale is on the order of the heliocentric distance itself, so $L_{char} \\approx r$. Therefore, the condition becomes $\\lambda_{mfp} \\gg r$. For the solar wind near $1$ AU, the proton-proton collisional mean free path is indeed on the order of $1$ AU or larger, making the collisionless approximation appropriate for describing its global expansion.\n\n2.  **Scale Separation of Times**: Equivalently, the characteristic timescale of the plasma phenomena, $\\tau_{char}$, must be much shorter than the mean time between collisions, $\\tau_c$. For solar wind expansion, the characteristic time is the expansion time, $\\tau_{char} \\approx L_{char}/U_{sw} \\approx r/U_{sw}$, where $U_{sw}$ is the bulk solar wind speed. The condition is thus $\\tau_c \\gg r/U_{sw}$. Since $\\tau_c = \\lambda_{mfp}/v_{th}$ and typically $v_{th} \\sim U_{sw}$, this condition is largely equivalent to the length scale separation.\n\n3.  **Dominance of Collective Behavior**: The Vlasov equation is a mean-field theory. Its applicability requires that the plasma's behavior is governed by collective interactions mediated by long-range fields, rather than by discrete binary encounters. This is true for a system that qualifies as a plasma, which is quantitatively expressed by the condition that the number of particles in a Debye sphere, $N_D$, is much greater than one ($N_D \\gg 1$). The Debye sphere has a radius equal to the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. For the solar wind near $1$ AU, $N_D$ is extremely large (typically $> 10^{10}$), so this fundamental assumption is robustly satisfied.\n\nIn summary, the key justification for the collisionless Vlasov description of the solar wind on large scales is that the plasma is sufficiently hot and tenuous such that the mean free path against Coulomb collisions is comparable to or larger than the macroscopic scale of the system itself.",

The characteristic equations relating these points are:\n$$\nv_t = v_b + a\\Delta, \\quad x_t = v_b \\Delta + \\frac{1}{2}a\\Delta^2\n$$\nWe can solve this system for $\\Delta$ and $v_b$. Substituting $v_b = v_t - a\\Delta$ from the first equation into the second gives a quadratic equation for $\\Delta$:\n$$\nx_t = (v_t - a\\Delta)\\Delta + \\frac{1}{2}a\\Delta^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{2}a\\Delta^2 - v_t\\Delta + x_t = 0\n$$\nThe solution depends on whether $a=0$ or $a\\neq 0$.\n\nCase 1: $a=0$\nThe equation simplifies to $-v_t\\Delta + x_t = 0$, yielding $\\Delta = x_t/v_t$. For a valid physical trajectory from the inflow boundary, we require:\n1. $v_t > 0$: The particle must be moving from $x=0$ towards $x=x_t$.\n2. $0 < \\Delta \\le t_f$: The particle must have left the boundary after $t=0$ and arrived at or before $t=t_f$.\nThe boundary velocity is $v_b = v_t$, which is positive as required.\n\nCase 2: $a\\neq0$\nThe quadratic equation for $\\Delta$ has solutions\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{v_t \\pm \\sqrt{v_t^2 - 2ax_t}}{a} $$\nInstead of testing both roots, we can use a more physical approach. From the characteristic equations, we can derive the energy-like relation $v_t^2 - v_b^2 = 2ax_t$. Since we require an inflow velocity $v_b > 0$, we must have $v_b^2 = v_t^2 - 2ax_t > 0$. This gives the boundary velocity as $v_b = \\sqrt{v_t^2 - 2ax_t}$. The discriminant $D = v_t^2 - 2ax_t$ must be positive. Once $v_b$ is found, $\\Delta$ is uniquely determined from $v_t = v_b + a\\Delta$ as $\\Delta = (v_t - v_b)/a$.\n\nThe complete set of conditions for a non-zero contribution when $a\\neq0$ is:\n1. $D = v_t^2 - 2ax_t > 0$: A real, positive-velocity solution at the boundary must exist.\n2. Calculate $v_b = \\sqrt{D}$ and $\\Delta = (v_t - v_b)/a$.\n3. $0 < \\Delta \\le t_f$: The transit time must be physically meaningful.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the boundary crossing time is $s=t_f-\\Delta$. The value of the distribution function is then determined by the piecewise inflow boundary condition:\n$$\nf_{\\text{in}}(v_b,s)=\n\\begin{cases}\nM(v_b;U_{\\text{up}},v_{\\text{th,up}}), & 0\\le s<t_s, \\\\\nM(v_b;U_{\\text{dn}},v_{\\text{th,dn}}), & s\\ge t_s,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $M(v;U,v_{\\text{th}})=\\frac{n_0}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,v_{\\text{th}}}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(v-U)^2}{2 v_{\\text{th}}^2}\\right)$ with $n_0=1$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the required physical quantities by numerically integrating over the velocity grid $v \\in [v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}]$ with $N_v$ points and spacing $\\Delta v$. The integrals are approximated by sums:\n- Number density (with $n_0=1$ normalization): $n = \\int f dv \\approx \\sum_i f(x_t, v_i, t_f) \\Delta v$.\n- Mean velocity: $u = \\frac{1}{n} \\int vf dv \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i v_i f(x_t, v_i, t_f) \\Delta v$. We report $u/U_{\\text{up}}$.\n- Upstream density fraction: $\\phi = \\frac{\\int f_{\\text{up}} dv}{\\int f dv} \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{upstream}} f(x_t, v_i, t_f)}{\\sum_i f(x_t, v_i, t_f)}$, where the upstream sum is over contributions with $s < t_s$.\n\nThe algorithm is implemented for each test case by discretizing the velocity domain, applying the characteristic-based logic for each grid point $(x_t, v_i, t_f)$ to calculate $f(x_t, v_i, t_f)$, and then performing the summations to find $n$, $u/U_{\\text{up}}$, and $\\phi$.",
