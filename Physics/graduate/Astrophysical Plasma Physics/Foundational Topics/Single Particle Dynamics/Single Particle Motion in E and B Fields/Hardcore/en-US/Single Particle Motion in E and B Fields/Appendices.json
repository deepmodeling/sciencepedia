It is a standard exercise in classical electrodynamics concerning single particle motion in uniform, static, and parallel electric and magnetic fields. All necessary information is provided, and the quantities to be derived are clearly defined.\n\nThe motion of a particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ in electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by the Lorentz force law, combined with Newton's second law for non-relativistic motion:\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe given fields are $\\mathbf{E} = E\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\mathbf{B} = B\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $E$ and $B$ are the constant magnitudes of the fields, assumed to be non-negative.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the particle's speed is $v_0$, and its velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}(0)$ makes a pitch angle $\\alpha$ with the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis. We can decompose the initial velocity into components parallel and perpendicular to the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis (and thus to both $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$):\nThe component parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is $v_{z}(0) = v_0 \\cos(\\alpha)$.\nThe component perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ has magnitude $v_{\\perp}(0) = v_0 \\sin(\\alpha)$.\nThus, the initial velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v}(0) = v_{\\perp}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\perp} + v_{z}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\perp}$ is a unit vector in the $x-y$ plane.\n\nFirst, we derive the gyroperiod $T_c$. The gyroperiod is the time taken for the particle to complete one orbit in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. This motion is driven by the magnetic force component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$ and thus has no component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$; it does not affect the gyromotion. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force for the circular motion:\n$$\nm \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{r_c} = |q| v_{\\perp} B\n$$\nwhere $r_c$ is the gyroradius. The angular frequency of this gyration, known as the cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$, is:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r_c} = \\frac{|q| B}{m}\n$$\nThe gyroperiod $T_c$ is the time for one full circle ($2\\pi$ radians):\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{2\\pi m}{|q| B}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the characteristic acceleration timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}}$, defined as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}} \\equiv v_{0} / |\\frac{dv}{dt}|_{t=0}$, where $v = |\\mathbf{v}|$ is the particle's speed. To find the rate of change of speed $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, we start from the expression for the squared speed, $v^2 = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$. Differentiating both sides with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(v^2) = 2v \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = 2\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the equation of motion for $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}$:\n$$\nv \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right) = \\frac{q}{m} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}))\n$$\nThe term $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ is a scalar triple product involving two identical vectors, $\\mathbf{v}$, and is therefore identically zero. This confirms that the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity and does no work, thus it cannot change the particle's speed or kinetic energy. The rate of change of speed is solely due to the electric field:\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{q}{mv} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E})\n$$\nWe evaluate this expression at $t=0$. At this instant, $v = v_0$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}(0)$.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\frac{q}{m v_0} (\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{E})\n$$\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = (v_{\\perp}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\perp} + v_{z}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\cdot (E\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = v_{z}(0) E = (v_0 \\cos(\\alpha)) E\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the rate of change of speed at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\frac{q}{m v_0} (v_0 E \\cos(\\alpha)) = \\frac{q E \\cos(\\alpha)}{m}\n$$\nThe definition of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}}$ requires the absolute value of this rate:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\left|\\frac{q E \\cos(\\alpha)}{m}\\right| = \\frac{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}{m}\n$$\nNote that the absolute value $|\\cos(\\alpha)|$ is necessary as the pitch angle $\\alpha$ can range from $0$ to $\\pi$. Using this, the acceleration timescale is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}} = \\frac{v_{0}}{\\left|\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}} = \\frac{v_{0}}{\\frac{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}{m}} = \\frac{m v_0}{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}\n$$\nThis expression becomes singular if $\\alpha = \\pi/2$, which is physically correct as the initial velocity is perpendicular to the electric field, leading to zero initial rate of change of speed.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R \\equiv \\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}} / T_c$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}}}{T_c} = \\frac{\\frac{m v_0}{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}}{\\frac{2\\pi m}{|q| B}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling the common terms $|q|$ and $m$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{m v_0}{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|} \\cdot \\frac{|q| B}{2\\pi m} = \\frac{v_0 B}{2\\pi E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the dimensionless ratio $R$ in terms of the given parameters.",

The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe motion of the charged particle is governed by the Lorentz force law, $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$. The particle's acceleration is $\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{F}/m$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the time-integrated parallel acceleration**\n\nWe are asked to find $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a_{\\parallel}(t)\\,dt$. The parallel component of the acceleration, $a_{\\parallel}$, is the projection of the total acceleration vector $\\mathbf{a}$ onto the direction of the magnetic field, given by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\mathbf{B}/|\\mathbf{B}|$.\n$$a_{\\parallel}(t) = \\mathbf{a}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{E}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t)) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$$\nThe electric field is given as parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$, so $\\mathbf{E}(t) = E_{\\parallel}(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, where $E_{\\parallel}(t) = E_{0}\\exp(-t^{2}/\\tau^{2})$. Thus, $\\mathbf{E}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = E_{\\parallel}(t)$.\nThe magnetic force term, $\\mathbf{v}(t) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t)$, is by definition perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}(t)$, and therefore perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. So, $(\\mathbf{v}(t) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t)) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = 0$.\nThe parallel acceleration simplifies to:\n$$a_{\\parallel}(t) = \\frac{q}{m}E_{\\parallel}(t) = \\frac{qE_{0}}{m}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right)$$\nThe time-integrated parallel acceleration is the total change in the parallel velocity, $\\Delta v_{\\parallel}$.\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a_{\\parallel}(t)\\,dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{qE_{0}}{m}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right) dt = \\frac{qE_{0}}{m} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right) dt$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp(-ax^{2}) dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. Here, $x=t$ and $a=1/\\tau^2$.\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right) dt = \\sqrt{\\pi / (1/\\tau^{2})} = \\tau\\sqrt{\\pi}$$\nTherefore, the time-integrated parallel acceleration is:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a_{\\parallel}(t)\\,dt = \\frac{qE_{0}\\tau\\sqrt{\\pi}}{m}$$\nThis quantity represents the net change in the particle's velocity component parallel to the magnetic field, $\\Delta v_{\\parallel}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the new mirror ratio $R' = B_{m}'/B_{0}$**\n\nAfter the pulse, the particle moves in a static magnetic field. Its motion conserves two quantities: the total kinetic energy $K$ and the first adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment) $\\mu$.\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2})$$\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp}^{2}}{B}$$\nThe problem states that during the pulse, the first adiabatic invariant $\\mu$ is conserved, and the particle remains at $z=0$, where $B=B_0$. So, during the pulse, we have:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp}^{2}(t)}{B_{0}} = \\text{constant}$$\nSince $m$ and $B_0$ are constants, the perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp}(t)$ must also be constant during the pulse. Thus, the perpendicular speed after the pulse, which we denote $v_{\\perp f}$, is equal to the initial perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp 0}$.\n$$v_{\\perp f} = v_{\\perp 0}$$\nThe parallel speed after the pulse, $v_{\\parallel f}$, is the initial parallel speed $v_{\\parallel 0}$ plus the change $\\Delta v_{\\parallel}$ calculated in the first part.\n$$v_{\\parallel f} = v_{\\parallel 0} + \\Delta v_{\\parallel} = v_{\\parallel 0} + \\frac{qE_{0}\\tau\\sqrt{\\pi}}{m}$$\nNow, consider the particle's motion after the pulse. At $z=0$, the magnetic field is $B_0$, and the particle's velocity components are $v_{\\parallel f}$ and $v_{\\perp f}$. The particle travels along the field line to a mirror point, where its parallel velocity becomes zero, $v_{\\parallel}'=0$. Let the magnetic field at this new mirror point be $B_{m}'$. The particle's speed at the mirror point is purely perpendicular, $v' = v_{\\perp}'$.\n\nBy conservation of energy between $z=0$ (after the pulse) and the mirror point:\n$$K_f = K' \\implies \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\parallel f}^{2} + v_{\\perp f}^{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\perp}')^{2}$$\n$$(v_{\\perp}')^{2} = v_{\\parallel f}^{2} + v_{\\perp f}^{2}$$\nBy conservation of the magnetic moment $\\mu$ between $z=0$ (after the pulse) and the mirror point:\n$$\\mu_f = \\mu' \\implies \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp f}^{2}}{B_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\perp}')^{2}}{B_{m}'}$$\n$$\\frac{v_{\\perp f}^{2}}{B_{0}} = \\frac{(v_{\\perp}')^{2}}{B_{m}'}$$\nWe want to find the new mirror ratio $R' = B_{m}'/B_{0}$. From the conservation of $\\mu$, we have:\n$$R' = \\frac{B_{m}'}{B_{0}} = \\frac{(v_{\\perp}')^{2}}{v_{\\perp f}^{2}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $(v_{\\perp}')^{2}$ from energy conservation:\n$$R' = \\frac{v_{\\parallel f}^{2} + v_{\\perp f}^{2}}{v_{\\perp f}^{2}} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{v_{\\parallel f}}{v_{\\perp f}}\\right)^{2}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $v_{\\parallel f}$ and $v_{\\perp f}$:\n$$R' = 1 + \\frac{\\left(v_{\\parallel 0} + \\frac{qE_{0}\\tau\\sqrt{\\pi}}{m}\\right)^{2}}{v_{\\perp 0}^{2}}$$\nThis gives the new mirror ratio in terms of the initial parameters and pulse characteristics.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the time-integrated parallel acceleration and the new mirror ratio.",

The Lorentz transformation for the electric field is given by $\\mathbf{E}' = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{d}}^2}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{d}}+1} \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}}{c^2} (\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E})$.\nTo make $\\mathbf{E}' = \\mathbf{0}$, the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$ must be perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ (to cancel the vector $\\mathbf{E}$), so we can assume $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$. The condition for $\\mathbf{E}'=\\mathbf{0}$ simplifies to $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nTo solve for $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, we take the cross product with $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} + (\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nUsing the vector triple product identity $(\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{C} = (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{A}$, we get:\n$(\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B} = (\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\nSince the boost direction $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. This simplifies the term to $-B^2 \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\nSubstituting back into the equation: $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} - B^2 \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nThis gives the drift velocity:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\n$$\nFor the given fields, $\\mathbf{E}=E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{B}=B_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the drift velocity is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{(E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\times (B_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})}{B_{0}^2} = \\frac{E_{0} B_{0}}{B_{0}^2} (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{E_{0}}{B_{0}} (-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = -\\frac{E_{0}}{B_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nThe components of the drift velocity are $(v_{dx}, v_{dy}, v_{dz}) = (0, -E_0/B_0, 0)$.\n\n**Part 2: Particle Trajectory in the Drift Frame $S'$**\n\nIn the frame $S'$, the electric field is $\\mathbf{E}'=\\mathbf{0}$. The magnetic field transforms as $\\mathbf{B}' = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathbf{B} - \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}}{c^2} \\times \\mathbf{E})$. Since $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$, we get $\\mathbf{B}'=\\mathbf{B}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{d}}$, where $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{d}} = (1 - v_{\\mathrm{d}}^2/c^2)^{-1/2} = (1 - E_0^2/(c^2B_0^2))^{-1/2}$. Thus, $\\mathbf{B}' = B_0 \\sqrt{1 - E_0^2/(c^2B_0^2)} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nNext, we find the particle's initial velocity $\\mathbf{u}'(0)$ in frame $S'$. The initial velocity in $S$ is $\\mathbf{u}(0) = v_{\\parallel 0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The frame $S'$ moves with velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{d}} = -(E_0/B_0)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. Using the Lorentz velocity transformation for a boost along the y-axis:\n$u'_{x} = u_{x}/\\gamma_d(1-u_y v_d/c^2) \\implies u'_{0x} = 0$.\n$u'_{y} = (u_{y} - v_d)/(1-u_y v_d/c^2) \\implies u'_{0y} = (0 - (-E_0/B_0))/(1-0) = E_0/B_0$.\n$u'_{z} = u_{z}/\\gamma_d(1-u_y v_d/c^2) \\implies u'_{0z} = v_{\\parallel 0}/\\gamma_d$.\nThe initial velocity in $S'$ is $\\mathbf{u}'(0) = (E_0/B_0)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}' + (v_{\\parallel 0}/\\gamma_d)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}'$.\n\nThe motion in $S'$ is governed by the relativistic Lorentz force law with only a magnetic field: $d\\mathbf{p}'/dt' = q(\\mathbf{u}' \\times \\mathbf{B}')$. Since the magnetic force does no work, the particle's energy and Lorentz factor $\\gamma'$ in this frame are constant. The motion is a helix.\nThe parallel velocity is constant: $u'_{z}(t') = u'_{0z} = v_{\\parallel 0}/\\gamma_d$.\nThe perpendicular motion is circular with angular frequency given by the relativistic cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_c = \\frac{q B'}{m \\gamma'}$.\nThe particle's Lorentz factor in $S'$ is $\\gamma' = \\gamma_0 \\gamma_d$.\nSo, $\\Omega_c = \\frac{q (B_0/\\gamma_d)}{m (\\gamma_0 \\gamma_d)} = \\frac{q B_0}{m \\gamma_0 \\gamma_d^2} = \\frac{q B_0}{m \\gamma_0} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right)$.\nThe perpendicular speed is $u'_\\perp = E_0/B_0$. The radius of gyration is $r'_g = \\frac{u'_\\perp}{\\Omega_c} = \\frac{E_0/B_0}{\\Omega_c} = \\frac{m \\gamma_0 E_0}{q B_0^2 (1 - E_0^2/(c^2B_0^2))}$.\n\nThe initial conditions in $S'$ are $\\mathbf{r}'(0) = \\mathbf{0}$ at $t'=0$ (since $\\mathbf{r}(0)=\\mathbf{0}, t=0$ in $S$). The velocity components in the $x'y'$-plane are $u'_{x}(t') = r'_g \\Omega_c \\sin(\\Omega_c t')$, $u'_{y}(t') = r'_g \\Omega_c \\cos(\\Omega_c t')$, which upon integration from $\\mathbf{r}'(0)=\\mathbf{0}$ yield:\n$x'(t') = \\int_0^{t'} u'_{x}(\\tau)d\\tau = r'_g (1 - \\cos(\\Omega_c t'))$\n$y'(t') = \\int_0^{t'} u'_{y}(\\tau)d\\tau = r'_g \\sin(\\Omega_c t')$\nThe parallel motion is:\n$z'(t') = u'_{0z}t' = (v_{\\parallel 0}/\\gamma_d) t'$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $r'_g$, $\\Omega_c$, $v_{\\parallel 0}$, and $\\gamma_d$:\n$x'(t') = \\frac{m \\gamma_0 E_0}{q B_0^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right)} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{q B_0}{m \\gamma_0} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right) t'\\right)\\right)$\n$y'(t') = \\frac{m \\gamma_0 E_0}{q B_0^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right)} \\sin\\left(\\frac{q B_0}{m \\gamma_0} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right) t'\\right)$\n$z'(t') = \\frac{c\\sqrt{1-\\gamma_{0}^{-2}}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right)^{-1/2}} t' = c \\sqrt{\\left(1 - \\gamma_0^{-2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2 B_0^2}\\right)} t'$\nThese are the final expressions for the trajectory in the drift frame.",
