It is a standard exercise in classical electrodynamics concerning single particle motion in uniform, static, and parallel electric and magnetic fields. All necessary information is provided, and the quantities to be derived are clearly defined.\n\nThe motion of a particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$ in electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by the Lorentz force law, combined with Newton's second law for non-relativistic motion:\n$$\nm \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe given fields are $\\mathbf{E} = E\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\mathbf{B} = B\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $E$ and $B$ are the constant magnitudes of the fields, assumed to be non-negative.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the particle's speed is $v_0$, and its velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}(0)$ makes a pitch angle $\\alpha$ with the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis. We can decompose the initial velocity into components parallel and perpendicular to the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis (and thus to both $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$):\nThe component parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is $v_{z}(0) = v_0 \\cos(\\alpha)$.\nThe component perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ has magnitude $v_{\\perp}(0) = v_0 \\sin(\\alpha)$.\nThus, the initial velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v}(0) = v_{\\perp}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\perp} + v_{z}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\perp}$ is a unit vector in the $x-y$ plane.\n\nFirst, we derive the gyroperiod $T_c$. The gyroperiod is the time taken for the particle to complete one orbit in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. This motion is driven by the magnetic force component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$. The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$ and thus has no component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$; it does not affect the gyromotion. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force for the circular motion:\n$$\nm \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{r_c} = |q| v_{\\perp} B\n$$\nwhere $r_c$ is the gyroradius. The angular frequency of this gyration, known as the cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$, is:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r_c} = \\frac{|q| B}{m}\n$$\nThe gyroperiod $T_c$ is the time for one full circle ($2\\pi$ radians):\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{2\\pi m}{|q| B}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the characteristic acceleration timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}}$, defined as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}} \\equiv v_{0} / |\\frac{dv}{dt}|_{t=0}$, where $v = |\\mathbf{v}|$ is the particle's speed. To find the rate of change of speed $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, we start from the expression for the squared speed, $v^2 = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$. Differentiating both sides with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(v^2) = 2v \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) = 2\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the equation of motion for $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}$:\n$$\nv \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right) = \\frac{q}{m} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}))\n$$\nThe term $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ is a scalar triple product involving two identical vectors, $\\mathbf{v}$, and is therefore identically zero. This confirms that the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity and does no work, thus it cannot change the particle's speed or kinetic energy. The rate of change of speed is solely due to the electric field:\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{q}{mv} (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{E})\n$$\nWe evaluate this expression at $t=0$. At this instant, $v = v_0$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}(0)$.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\frac{q}{m v_0} (\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{E})\n$$\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = (v_{\\perp}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{\\perp} + v_{z}(0)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\cdot (E\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = v_{z}(0) E = (v_0 \\cos(\\alpha)) E\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the rate of change of speed at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\frac{q}{m v_0} (v_0 E \\cos(\\alpha)) = \\frac{q E \\cos(\\alpha)}{m}\n$$\nThe definition of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}}$ requires the absolute value of this rate:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\left|\\frac{q E \\cos(\\alpha)}{m}\\right| = \\frac{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}{m}\n$$\nNote that the absolute value $|\\cos(\\alpha)|$ is necessary as the pitch angle $\\alpha$ can range from $0$ to $\\pi$. Using this, the acceleration timescale is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}} = \\frac{v_{0}}{\\left|\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}} = \\frac{v_{0}}{\\frac{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}{m}} = \\frac{m v_0}{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}\n$$\nThis expression becomes singular if $\\alpha = \\pi/2$, which is physically correct as the initial velocity is perpendicular to the electric field, leading to zero initial rate of change of speed.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R \\equiv \\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}} / T_c$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{accel}}}{T_c} = \\frac{\\frac{m v_0}{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}}{\\frac{2\\pi m}{|q| B}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling the common terms $|q|$ and $m$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{m v_0}{|q| E |\\cos(\\alpha)|} \\cdot \\frac{|q| B}{2\\pi m} = \\frac{v_0 B}{2\\pi E |\\cos(\\alpha)|}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the dimensionless ratio $R$ in terms of the given parameters.",

The field has a minimum $B_{0}$ at the magnetic equator $z=0$ and increases monotonically to larger values $B(z)>B_{0}$ toward the mirror regions at $|z|>0$. The particle is initially located at $z=0$ with perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp 0}$ and parallel speed $v_{\\parallel 0}$, and is mirror-trapped (i.e., would reflect before reaching regions where $B(z)$ exceeds some finite maximum $B_{\\max}$).

Calculation of the time-integrated parallel acceleration**\n\nWe are asked to find $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a_{\\parallel}(t)\\,dt$. The parallel component of the acceleration, $a_{\\parallel}$, is the projection of the total acceleration vector $\\mathbf{a}$ onto the direction of the magnetic field, given by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\mathbf{B}/|\\mathbf{B}|$.\n$$a_{\\parallel}(t) = \\mathbf{a}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac{q}{m}(\\mathbf{E}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t)) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$$\nThe electric field is given as parallel to $\\mathbf{B}$, so $\\mathbf{E}(t) = E_{\\parallel}(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$, where $E_{\\parallel}(t) = E_{0}\\exp(-t^{2}/\\tau^{2})$. Thus, $\\mathbf{E}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = E_{\\parallel}(t)$.\nThe magnetic force term, $\\mathbf{v}(t) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t)$, is by definition perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}(t)$, and therefore perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}$. So, $(\\mathbf{v}(t) \\times \\mathbf{B}(t)) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = 0$.\nThe parallel acceleration simplifies to:\n$$a_{\\parallel}(t) = \\frac{q}{m}E_{\\parallel}(t) = \\frac{qE_{0}}{m}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right)$$\nThe time-integrated parallel acceleration is the total change in the parallel velocity, $\\Delta v_{\\parallel}$.\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} a_{\\parallel}(t)\\,dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{qE_{0}}{m}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right) dt = \\frac{qE_{0}}{m} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right) dt$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp(-ax^{2}) dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$.

Calculation of the new mirror ratio $R' = B_{m}'/B_{0}$**\n\nAfter the pulse, the particle moves in a static magnetic field.

So, during the pulse, we have:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp}^{2}(t)}{B_{0}} = \\text{constant}$$\nSince $m$ and $B_0$ are constants, the perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp}(t)$ must also be constant during the pulse. Thus, the perpendicular speed after the pulse, which we denote $v_{\\perp f}$, is equal to the initial perpendicular speed $v_{\\perp 0}$.\n$$v_{\\perp f} = v_{\\perp 0}$$\nThe parallel speed after the pulse, $v_{\\parallel f}$, is the initial parallel speed $v_{\\parallel 0}$ plus the change $\\Delta v_{\\parallel}$ calculated in the first part.\n$$v_{\\parallel f} = v_{\\parallel 0} + \\Delta v_{\\parallel} = v_{\\parallel 0} + \\frac{qE_{0}\\tau\\sqrt{\\pi}}{m}$$\nNow, consider the particle's motion after the pulse. At $z=0$, the magnetic field is $B_0$, and the particle's velocity components are $v_{\\parallel f}$ and $v_{\\perp f}$. The particle travels along the field line to a mirror point, where its parallel velocity becomes zero, $v_{\\parallel}'=0$. Let the magnetic field at this new mirror point be $B_{m}'$. The particle's speed at the mirror point is purely perpendicular, $v' = v_{\\perp}'$.\n\nBy conservation of energy between $z=0$ (after the pulse) and the mirror point:\n$$K_f = K' \\implies \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\parallel f}^{2} + v_{\\perp f}^{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\perp}')^{2}$$\n$$(v_{\\perp}')^{2} = v_{\\parallel f}^{2} + v_{\\perp f}^{2}$$\nBy conservation of the magnetic moment $\\mu$ between $z=0$ (after the pulse) and the mirror point:\n$$\\mu_f = \\mu' \\implies \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp f}^{2}}{B_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}m(v_{\\perp}')^{2}}{B_{m}'}$$\n$$\\frac{v_{\\perp f}^{2}}{B_{0}} = \\frac{(v_{\\perp}')^{2}}{B_{m}'}$$\nWe want to find the new mirror ratio $R' = B_{m}'/B_{0}$. From the conservation of $\\mu$, we have:\n$$R' = \\frac{B_{m}'}{B_{0}} = \\frac{(v_{\\perp}')^{2}}{v_{\\perp f}^{2}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $(v_{\\perp}')^{2}$ from energy conservation:\n$$R' = \\frac{v_{\\parallel f}^{2} + v_{\\perp f}^{2}}{v_{\\perp f}^{2}} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{v_{\\parallel f}}{v_{\\perp f}}\\right)^{2}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $v_{\\parallel f}$ and $v_{\\perp f}$:\n$$R' = 1 + \\frac{\\left(v_{\\parallel 0} + \\frac{qE_{0}\\tau\\sqrt{\\pi}}{m}\\right)^{2}}{v_{\\perp 0}^{2}}$$\nThis gives the new mirror ratio in terms of the initial parameters and pulse characteristics.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the time-integrated parallel acceleration and the new mirror ratio.",
