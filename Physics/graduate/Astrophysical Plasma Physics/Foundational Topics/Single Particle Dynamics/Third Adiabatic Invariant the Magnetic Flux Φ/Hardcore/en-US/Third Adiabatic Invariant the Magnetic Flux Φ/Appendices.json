This problem presents a compelling astrophysical scenario where a planet's magnetic dynamo weakens over geological timescales.

            "problem": "A charged particle is trapped within a planetary magnetosphere, which is well-approximated by the magnetic field of a pure dipole with moment $\\mathbf{m}$. The particle executes three distinct periodic motions: a fast gyration about a magnetic field line, an intermediate-speed bounce between magnetic mirror points, and a slow azimuthal drift around the planet. For slow changes to the magnetic field, each of these motions has an associated adiabatic invariant.\n\nWe are interested in the third adiabatic invariant, $\\Phi$, which is associated with the slow drift motion. For a dipole field, this invariant can be defined as the total magnetic flux passing through the region of the equatorial plane external to the particle's drift orbit. The drift orbit, for particles mirroring near the equator, can be approximated as a circle of radius $R$ in the equatorial plane. Thus, the invariant is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_R^\\infty B_{eq}(r) (2\\pi r) dr\n$$\nwhere $B_{eq}(r)$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field in the equatorial plane at a radial distance $r$ from the center of the dipole.

You will examine a charged particle trapped within a slowly compressing astrophysical flux rope, a common structure in solar and stellar coronae. The exercise requires you to first justify the conservation of $\\Phi$ by relating it to the MHD principle of frozen-in magnetic flux, and then use this conservation to calculate the effect of compression on the particle's orbit.

            "problem": "Consider an axisymmetric coronal flux rope in an astrophysical plasma, idealized as a thin torus with a nearly uniform axial magnetic field $B(t)$ threading its interior. A single charged particle is magnetically trapped and executes fast gyro-motion and bounce motion, while its guiding center drifts azimuthally around the torus on a closed drift shell of instantaneous major radius $R(t)$, lying in a plane perpendicular to the axial field. Assume a strict hierarchy of timescales: the gyro-period $T_{\\mathrm{gyro}}$, bounce period $T_{\\mathrm{bounce}}$, and drift period $T_{\\mathrm{drift}}$ satisfy $T_{\\mathrm{gyro}}, T_{\\mathrm{bounce}}, T_{\\mathrm{drift}} \\ll \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the characteristic timescale over which the magnetic configuration is slowly compressed or expanded; and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\gg \\tau$ so that collisions are negligible. The plasma evolution is governed by ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), meaning the electric field is such that magnetic field lines are frozen into the plasma flow, and any induced electric field from the slow evolution satisfies Faraday’s law.\n\nStarting only from Faraday’s law, the Lorentz force, and the guiding-center reduction in an axisymmetric magnetic geometry, argue why the third adiabatic invariant associated with the particle’s azimuthal drift — the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ linking the drift shell — is conserved under the assumed slow, axisymmetric compression/expansion. Then, modeling the axial magnetic field inside the torus as spatially uniform with magnitude $B(t)$, use the conservation of the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ linked by the drift shell to determine the final drift-shell radius $R_{f}$ after a slow compression from an initial state with magnetic field magnitude $B_{i}$ and drift-shell radius $R_{i}$ to a final state with $B_{f}$.

            "solution": "**Part 1: Argument for the Conservation of the Third Adiabatic Invariant ($\\Phi$)**\n\nThe problem requires an argument for the conservation of the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ enclosed by the particle's drift shell, based on the provided physical principles.\n\n1.  **Ideal MHD and Frozen-In Flux:** The problem states the plasma evolution is governed by ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). A fundamental consequence of ideal MHD (which combines Faraday's Law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\partial \\mathbf{B}/\\partial t$, and the ideal Ohm's Law, $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{plasma}} \\times \\mathbf{B} = 0$) is Alfvén's frozen-in flux theorem. This theorem states that the magnetic flux through any closed loop that moves with the local plasma fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{plasma}}$ is constant in time.\n\n2.  **Drift Shell Motion:** The particle's drift shell is a surface defined by its guiding-center motion. The evolution of this shell under slow compression is determined by the plasma flow. The timescale for evolution, $\\tau$, is much longer than the particle's drift period, meaning the particle samples the entire shell many times before the shell itself moves. The forces causing the shell to compress (primarily the induced electric field via the $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ drift, which is the dominant component of the bulk plasma motion perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$) are the same forces driving the bulk plasma. Therefore, it is appropriate to identify the velocity of the drift shell with the local plasma fluid velocity.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the particle's drift shell moves with the plasma fluid, and the magnetic flux through any such moving loop is conserved according to Alfvén's theorem, the third adiabatic invariant $\\Phi$ (the magnetic flux enclosed by the drift shell) must be conserved during the slow compression. Therefore, $\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Final Radius**\n\nHaving established that the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ is conserved, we can relate the initial and final states of the system.\n$$\n\\Phi_i = \\Phi_f\n$$\nThe problem simplifies the geometry by modeling the axial magnetic field as spatially uniform with magnitude $B(t)$, and the drift shell as having a radius $R(t)$. The area enclosed by the circular drift shell is $A(t) = \\pi R(t)^2$. The magnetic flux through this area is:\n$$\n\\Phi(t) = \\mathbf{B}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{A}(t) = B(t) A(t) \\cos(0) = B(t) \\pi R(t)^2\n$$\nApplying the conservation of flux, we have:\n$$\nB_i \\pi R_i^2 = B_f \\pi R_f^2\n$$\nThe factor of $\\pi$ cancels on both sides:\n$$\nB_i R_i^2 = B_f R_f^2\n$$\nWe are asked to solve for the final radius, $R_f$:\n$$\nR_f^2 = R_i^2 \\frac{B_i}{B_f}\n$$\n$$\nR_f = R_i \\sqrt{\\frac{B_i}{B_f}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\nInitial magnetic field, $B_{i} = 2.7 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}$\nInitial radius, $R_{i} = 19.4\\ \\mathrm{Mm}$\nFinal magnetic field, $B_{f} = 5.9 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n\n$$\nR_f = 19.4 \\ \\mathrm{Mm} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.7 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}}{5.9 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}}}\n$$\n$$\nR_f = 19.4 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.7}{5.9}}\\ \\mathrm{Mm}\n$$\n$$\nR_f \\approx 19.4 \\times \\sqrt{0.457627...}\\ \\mathrm{Mm}\n$$\n$$\nR_f \\approx 19.4 \\times 0.6764814...\\ \\mathrm{Mm}\n$$\n$$\nR_f \\approx 13.12374...\\ \\mathrm{Mm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR_f \\approx 13.12\\ \\mathrm{Mm}\n$$",
