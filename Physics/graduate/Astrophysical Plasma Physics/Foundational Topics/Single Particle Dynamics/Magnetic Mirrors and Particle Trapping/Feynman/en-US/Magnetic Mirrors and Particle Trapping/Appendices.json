By starting with the relativistic Lorentz force, you will derive the mirror force and discover that the critical pitch angle for trapping depends only on the geometry of the magnetic field—a surprisingly elegant result that holds true even at extreme energies.

            "problem": "A charged particle of rest mass $m$ and charge $q$ with Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ moves in a magnetostatic, axisymmetric magnetic mirror field in an astrophysical plasma. The magnetic field magnitude $B$ varies smoothly along the field-line arc length $s$, increasing from an equatorial value $B_{0}$ (at $s=0$) to a maximum $B_{\\mathrm{m}}$ at the mirror point. The particle experiences no electric field and the magnetic field varies on spatial and temporal scales that are long compared to the particle’s gyroradius and gyroperiod, so that guiding-center motion and the adiabatic invariants are applicable. The particle’s speed $v$ (and hence $\\gamma$) remains constant along the trajectory because the magnetic force does no work. Let the local pitch angle $\\alpha(s)$ be defined by $\\tan\\alpha(s)=v_{\\perp}(s)/v_{\\parallel}(s)$, where $v_{\\perp}(s)$ and $v_{\\parallel}(s)$ are the components of the velocity perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field, respectively.\n\nStarting from the Lorentz force and the conservation laws appropriate to slowly varying magnetostatic fields in Special Relativity, derive the parallel mirror force felt by the particle, $F_{\\parallel}(s)$, as a function of $B(s)$, $\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}s$, $m$, $q$, $\\gamma$, $v$, and $\\alpha(s)$, under the guiding-center approximation. Then, using conservation of total energy and the first adiabatic invariant for relativistic motion, derive the reflection condition and obtain the critical equatorial pitch angle $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (defined at $s=0$ where $B=B_{0}$) required for reflection at $B=B_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Introduce the mirror ratio $R=B_{\\mathrm{m}}/B_{0}$ and express your final answer for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in radians as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $R$. No numerical evaluation is required; provide the analytic expression only.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in relativistic electrodynamics and plasma physics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for two derivations followed by a final expression for the critical pitch angle.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Parallel Mirror Force, $F_{\\parallel}(s)$\n\nThe motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is governed by the relativistic Lorentz force equation. Given that the electric field is zero, $\\vec{E} = \\vec{0}$, the force $\\vec{F}$ on the particle is:\n$$ \\vec{F} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{p}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\nwhere $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m \\vec{v}$ is the relativistic momentum, $q$ is the charge, $m$ is the rest mass, $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity, $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic force does no work, which is consistent with $\\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0$. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the particle, $E_k = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, is constant. Since $m$ and $c$ are constants, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ and the particle's speed $v$ are also constant throughout the motion.\n\nThe mirror force, $F_{\\parallel}$, is the component of the force on the particle's guiding center parallel to the magnetic field line. This force arises from the spatial gradient of the magnetic field magnitude. We can derive this force by considering the change in the particle's parallel momentum. The parallel component of the force is what changes the parallel component of the velocity, $v_{\\parallel}$. The equation of motion for the parallel component is:\n$$ F_{\\parallel} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{\\parallel}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\gamma m v_{\\parallel})}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $m$ are constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ F_{\\parallel} = \\gamma m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\parallel}}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nThe total speed squared is constant: $v^2 = v_{\\perp}^2 + v_{\\parallel}^2 = \\text{constant}$. Differentiating this with respect to time $t$ gives:\n$$ 2v_{\\perp}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + 2v_{\\parallel}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\parallel}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\parallel}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{v_{\\parallel}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $F_{\\parallel}$:\n$$ F_{\\parallel} = -\\gamma m \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{v_{\\parallel}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nTo find $\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}/\\mathrm{d}t$, we use the first adiabatic invariant. For relativistic motion, the conserved quantity is the magnetic moment, which can be expressed in terms of the perpendicular momentum $p_{\\perp} = \\gamma m v_{\\perp}$. The invariant quantity is $I_1 = p_{\\perp}^2/B$.\n$$ \\frac{(\\gamma m v_{\\perp})^2}{B(s)} = \\text{constant} $$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $m$ are constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2(s)}{B(s)} = \\text{constant} $$\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left(\\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{B}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{2v_{\\perp}}{B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{B^2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}/\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{2B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nThe total time derivative of $B$ as experienced by the particle's guiding center is $\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}t = (\\vec{v}_{GC} \\cdot \\nabla)B$. In the guiding-center approximation, we use the parallel velocity component, $\\vec{v}_{GC} \\approx v_{\\parallel} \\hat{b}$, where $\\hat{b} = \\vec{B}/B$. The derivative along the field line is $\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}s = \\hat{b} \\cdot \\nabla B$. Thus, $\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}t = v_{\\parallel} (\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}s)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{\\perp}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{2B} v_{\\parallel} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}s} $$\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for $F_{\\parallel}$:\n$$ F_{\\parallel} = -\\gamma m \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{v_{\\parallel}} \\left( \\frac{v_{\\perp} v_{\\parallel}}{2B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}s} \\right) = -\\frac{\\gamma m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}s} $$\nThe term $\\mu = \\frac{\\gamma m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B}$ can be identified as the magnitude of the relativistic magnetic moment. The force is thus $F_{\\parallel} = -\\mu (\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}s)$.\nThe problem requires the force as a function of $B(s)$, $\\mathrm{d}B/\\mathrm{d}s$, $m$, $q$, $\\gamma$, $v$, and $\\alpha(s)$. We have the pitch angle definition $\\tan\\alpha(s) = v_{\\perp}(s)/v_{\\parallel}(s)$. From this and $v^2=v_{\\perp}^2+v_{\\parallel}^2$, we get $v_{\\perp}(s) = v \\sin\\alpha(s)$. Substituting this into the force expression:\n$$ F_{\\parallel}(s) = - \\frac{\\gamma m (v \\sin\\alpha(s))^2}{2B(s)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}s} $$\nThis expression depends on the specified variables. Note that the charge $q$ is not present in the final expression for the force.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Reflection Condition and Critical Pitch Angle $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$\n\nWe use the conservation of total energy and the first adiabatic invariant. As established, conservation of energy implies that $v$ and $\\gamma$ are constant. The first adiabatic invariant, derived from the constancy of the magnetic moment, leads to the relation (as shown above):\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2(s)}{B(s)} = \\text{constant} $$\nUsing $v_{\\perp}(s) = v \\sin\\alpha(s)$ and noting that $v$ is constant, the invariant relation can be written in terms of the pitch angle $\\alpha(s)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha(s)}{B(s)} = \\text{constant} $$\nLet's apply this relation between the equatorial plane (where $s=0$, $B=B_0$, and the pitch angle is $\\alpha_0$) and a general point $s$ on the field line:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha_0}{B_0} = \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha(s)}{B(s)} $$\nThis shows that as a particle moves into a region of stronger magnetic field ($B(s) > B_0$), its pitch angle $\\alpha(s)$ must increase.\nReflection occurs at the \"mirror point,\" which is the location where the particle's parallel velocity becomes zero, $v_{\\parallel} = 0$. At this point, the particle's velocity is entirely perpendicular to the magnetic field, so $v_{\\perp}=v$. This implies that the pitch angle at the reflection point is $\\alpha = \\pi/2$, for which $\\sin\\alpha = 1$.\nLet $B_{\\mathrm{refl}}$ be the magnetic field strength at the reflection point. Applying the invariant relation up to this point:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha_0}{B_0} = \\frac{\\sin^2(\\pi/2)}{B_{\\mathrm{refl}}} = \\frac{1}{B_{\\mathrm{refl}}} $$\nThe problem defines the critical equatorial pitch angle, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$, as the angle required for reflection to occur precisely at the point of maximum magnetic field, $B_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Therefore, for a particle starting with pitch angle $\\alpha_0 = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$, its reflection field is $B_{\\mathrm{refl}} = B_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}}{B_0} = \\frac{1}{B_{\\mathrm{m}}} $$\nSolving for $\\sin^2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$ \\sin^2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{B_0}{B_{\\mathrm{m}}} $$\nThe problem defines the mirror ratio $R = B_{\\mathrm{m}}/B_0$. Thus, $B_0/B_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1/R$.\n$$ \\sin^2\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{1}{R} $$\nTaking the square root (pitch angles are in $[0, \\pi/2]$, so sine is non-negative):\n$$ \\sin\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}} $$\nFinally, solving for the critical angle $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in radians gives the desired expression:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}}\\right) $$\nAny particle with an initial equatorial pitch angle $\\alpha_0  \\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$ will have a required reflection field $B_{\\mathrm{refl}} = B_0/\\sin^2\\alpha_0 > B_m$, and will thus pass through the mirror and escape. Particles with $\\alpha_0 \\ge \\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$ will be trapped.",
