            "solution": "The problem is to derive the compression ratio $r$ and temperature ratio $T_2/T_1$ for a steady, plane-parallel shock from the fundamental conservation laws of fluid dynamics, and then to evaluate these quantities for specific given parameters. The plasma is treated as an ideal monatomic gas. The derivation starts from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, which express the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across the shock front.\n\nLet the upstream state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the downstream state by subscript $2$. In the rest frame of the shock, the conservation laws are:\n1. Conservation of mass flux:\n$$ \\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2 $$\n2. Conservation of momentum flux:\n$$ P_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = P_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2 $$\n3. Conservation of energy flux:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 + h_1 = \\frac{1}{2} u_2^2 + h_2 $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $u$ is the fluid speed, $P$ is the pressure, and $h$ is the specific enthalpy. For an ideal gas with adiabatic index $\\gamma$, the specific enthalpy is given by $h = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{P}{\\rho}$.\n\nThe problem defines the compression ratio as $r \\equiv \\rho_2 / \\rho_1$. From the mass conservation equation, we can express the downstream velocity $u_2$ in terms of the upstream velocity $u_1$ and the compression ratio $r$:\n$$ u_2 = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} u_1 = \\frac{u_1}{r} $$\n\nNext, we rearrange the momentum conservation equation to solve for the pressure difference:\n$$ P_2 - P_1 = \\rho_1 u_1^2 - \\rho_2 u_2^2 $$\nSubstituting $u_2 = u_1/r$ and $\\rho_2 = r\\rho_1$:\n$$ P_2 - P_1 = \\rho_1 u_1^2 - (r\\rho_1)\\left(\\frac{u_1}{r}\\right)^2 = \\rho_1 u_1^2 - \\frac{\\rho_1 u_1^2}{r} = \\rho_1 u_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) $$\nTo express this in terms of the upstream Mach number $M_1 \\equiv u_1 / c_{s1}$, where $c_{s1}^2 = \\gamma P_1 / \\rho_1$, we divide by $P_1$:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} - 1 = \\frac{\\rho_1 u_1^2}{P_1} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) $$\nUsing $c_{s1}^2$, we can write $\\rho_1/P_1 = \\gamma/c_{s1}^2$. Thus, $\\frac{\\rho_1 u_1^2}{P_1} = \\frac{\\gamma u_1^2}{c_{s1}^2} = \\gamma M_1^2$.\nThis gives a relation for the pressure ratio:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = 1 + \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\quad (*)$$\n\nNow we use the energy conservation equation.

We solve for $r$ by substituting the expression for $P_2/P_1$ from $(*)$ into $(**)$:\n$$ M_1^2 + \\frac{2}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{M_1^2}{r^2} + \\frac{2}{r(\\gamma-1)} \\left[ 1 + \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ M_1^2 + \\frac{2}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{M_1^2}{r^2} + \\frac{2}{r(\\gamma-1)} + \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2}{r(\\gamma-1)} - \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2}{r^2(\\gamma-1)} $$\nMultiply the entire equation by $r^2(\\gamma-1)$ to clear denominators:\n$$ r^2(\\gamma-1)M_1^2 + 2r^2 = (\\gamma-1)M_1^2 + 2r + 2\\gamma r M_1^2 - 2\\gamma M_1^2 $$\nRearrange this into a quadratic equation. A known shortcut is to recognize that one solution must be the trivial \"no-shock\" case where $r=1$. Factoring out $(r-1)$ from the rearranged equation yields the physical shock solution:\n$$ r = \\frac{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}{2 + (\\gamma-1)M_1^2} $$\n\nNext, we derive the temperature ratio $T_2/T_1$. For an ideal gas, the equation of state is $P=nk_BT$, where $n$ is the number density. Since $n = \\rho/m$ where $m$ is the mean particle mass, $P = (\\rho/m)k_B T$. Therefore, $T$ is proportional to $P/\\rho$. The temperature ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2/\\rho_2}{P_1/\\rho_1} = \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{P_2}{P_1} $$\nWe find the pressure ratio first. From equation $(*)$ and our derived formula for $r$:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = 1 + \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) = 1 + \\gamma M_1^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{2 + (\\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2 - (\\gamma-1)}{\\gamma+1} $$\nFinally, we find the temperature ratio:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{2 + (\\gamma-1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2 - (\\gamma-1)}{\\gamma+1} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we evaluate these expressions for a monatomic gas ($\\gamma = 5/3$) and an upstream Mach number of $M_1=20$.\nFirst, we find the values of constants:\n$\\gamma = 5/3$\n$M_1 = 20 \\implies M_1^2 = 400$\n$\\gamma+1 = 5/3 + 1 = 8/3$\n$\\gamma-1 = 5/3 - 1 = 2/3$\n\nCalculate the compression ratio $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{(\\frac{8}{3})(400)}{2 + (\\frac{2}{3})(400)} = \\frac{3200/3}{2 + 800/3} = \\frac{3200/3}{(6+800)/3} = \\frac{3200}{806} = \\frac{1600}{403} \\approx 3.9702233... $$\nRounding to six significant figures, $r = 3.97022$.\n\nCalculate the temperature ratio $T_2/T_1$. We first find the pressure ratio $P_2/P_1$:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{2(\\frac{5}{3})(400) - (\\frac{2}{3})}{8/3} = \\frac{4000/3 - 2/3}{8/3} = \\frac{3998/3}{8/3} = \\frac{3998}{8} = \\frac{1999}{4} = 499.75 $$\nThen, we find the temperature ratio:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2/P_1}{r} = \\frac{1999/4}{1600/403} = \\frac{1999 \\times 403}{4 \\times 1600} = \\frac{805597}{6400} = 125.87453125 $$\nRounding to six significant figures, $T_2/T_1 = 125.875$.",

A standard approach is to integrate this equation across the shock front to obtain a jump condition. The speed of the fluid is $u(x)$ and the speed of the scattering centers is $w(x)$.

The spectral index becomes a function of momentum, $q(p)$, by substituting $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)$ into the derived formula:\n$$\nq(p) = q(r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)) = \\frac{3 r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)}{r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p) - 1}\n$$\nwhere the effective compression ratio is given by:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p) = r_{\\mathrm{sub}} + (r_{\\mathrm{tot}} - r_{\\mathrm{sub}})W(p) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad W(p) = 1 - \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{p}{p_c}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right]\n$$\nThis model captures how low-momentum particles see the subshock compression $r_{\\mathrm{sub}}$, while high-momentum particles see the total shock compression $r_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, leading to a curved (concave) spectrum.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computations**\n\nWe compute $q_{\\mathrm{low}} \\equiv q(p_{\\mathrm{low}})$, $q_{\\mathrm{high}} \\equiv q(p_{\\mathrm{high}})$, and $\\Delta \\equiv q_{\\mathrm{low}} - q_{\\mathrm{high}}$ for $p_{\\mathrm{low}} = 10^{-3}p_c$ and $p_{\\mathrm{high}} = 10^{3}p_c$.\n\n**Case A:** $(r_{\\mathrm{sub}}, r_{\\mathrm{tot}}, p_c, \\alpha) = (3.5, 6.0, 1.0, 1.0)$\n- For $p_{\\mathrm{low}}/p_c = 10^{-3}$, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_{\\mathrm{low}}) = 3.5 + 2.5(1 - e^{-0.001}) \\approx 3.50249875$.\n  $q_{\\mathrm{low}} = \\frac{3 \\times 3.50249875}{3.50249875 - 1} \\approx 4.198803$.\n- For $p_{\\mathrm{high}}/p_c = 10^{3}$, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_{\\mathrm{high}}) \\approx 3.5 + 2.5(1) = 6.0$.\n  $q_{\\mathrm{high}} = \\frac{3 \\times 6.0}{6.0 - 1} = 3.6$.\n- $\\Delta = 4.198803 - 3.600000 = 0.598803$.\n- Result A: $[4.198803, 3.600000, 0.598803]$\n\n**Case B:** $(r_{\\mathrm{sub}}, r_{\\mathrm{tot}}, p_c, \\alpha) = (4.0, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0)$\n- Here, $r_{\\mathrm{sub}} = r_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, so $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p) = 4.0$ for all $p$.\n- $q_{\\mathrm{low}} = q_{\\mathrm{high}} = \\frac{3 \\times 4.0}{4.0 - 1} = 4.0$.\n- $\\Delta = 4.0 - 4.0 = 0.0$.\n- Result B: $[4.000000, 4.000000, 0.000000]$\n\n**Case C:** $(r_{\\mathrm{sub}}, r_{\\mathrm{tot}}, p_c, \\alpha) = (3.2, 7.0, 1.0, 2.0)$\n- For $p_{\\mathrm{low}}/p_c = 10^{-3}$, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_{\\mathrm{low}}) = 3.2 + 3.8(1 - e^{-10^{-6}}) \\approx 3.2000038$.\n  $q_{\\mathrm{low}} = \\frac{3 \\times 3.2000038}{3.2000038 - 1} \\approx 4.363631$.\n- For $p_{\\mathrm{high}}/p_c = 10^{3}$, $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_{\\mathrm{high}}) \\approx 3.2 + 3.8(1) = 7.0$.\n  $q_{\\mathrm{high}} = \\frac{3 \\times 7.0}{7.0 - 1} = 3.5$.\n- $\\Delta = 4.363631 - 3.500000 = 0.863631$.\n- Result C: $[4.363631, 3.500000, 0.863631]$",
