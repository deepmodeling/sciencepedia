            "problem": "A dilute population of relativistic cosmic-ray ions of charge $q0$ and rest mass $m$ streams through a uniform magnetized background plasma with a uniform background magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{0}=B_{0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Consider a small-amplitude, monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ and wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, propagating obliquely in the $x$–$z$ plane at an angle $\\theta\\in(0,\\pi/2)$ with respect to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$, so that $k_{\\parallel}=k\\cos\\theta$ and $k_{\\perp}=k\\sin\\theta$, where $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$. A test cosmic-ray ion has speed $v$, Lorentz factor $\\gamma=(1-v^{2}/c^{2})^{-1/2}$, and pitch angle $\\alpha$ (the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$), with pitch-angle cosine $\\mu=\\cos\\alpha=v_{\\parallel}/v$. Let $\\Omega\\equiv q B_{0}/(m c)$ denote the nonrelativistic ion gyrofrequency, so that the relativistic gyrofrequency is $\\Omega/\\gamma$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the Lorentz force and the phase-locking definition of cyclotron resonance for a charged particle interacting with a weak plane wave, derive the resonance condition for oblique propagation by enforcing stationary phase for the $n$-th cyclotron harmonic, where $n$ is an integer (including $n=0$ for the Landau resonance and $n=\\pm 1,\\pm 2,\\dots$ for cyclotron harmonics).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the cyclotron resonance condition for a relativistic charged particle interacting with a plane electromagnetic wave in a uniform magnetic field, and then solving for the resonant pitch-angle cosine. The derivation must start from first principles.\n\nLet the uniform background magnetic field be $\\mathbf{B}_{0} = B_{0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. A cosmic-ray ion with charge $q > 0$ and rest mass $m$ moves in this field. In the absence of any other forces, the particle's motion is governed by the Lorentz force equation, $d\\mathbf{p}/dt = (q/c)\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{0}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = m\\gamma\\mathbf{v}$ is the relativistic momentum and $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor. The velocity of the particle $\\mathbf{v}$ can be decomposed into a component parallel to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$, $v_{\\parallel}$, which is constant, and a component perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$, which rotates at the relativistic gyrofrequency $\\Omega_{rel} = qB_{0}/(m\\gamma c)$. The nonrelativistic gyrofrequency is given as $\\Omega = qB_{0}/(mc)$, so we have $\\Omega_{rel} = \\Omega/\\gamma$. The particle executes a helical trajectory. The position of the particle at time $t$ can be written as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}_{gc}(t) + \\boldsymbol{\\rho}(t)$, where $\\mathbf{r}_{gc}(t)$ is the guiding center position moving with velocity $v_{\\parallel}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}(t)$ is the gyration vector in the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$. The magnitude of the gyroradius is $\\rho_L = v_{\\perp}/\\Omega_{rel}$. Let the gyrophase be $\\phi(t) = \\Omega_{rel}t + \\phi_0$. We can write the particle's velocity and position (with a suitable choice of coordinates and initial conditions) as:\n$v_{\\parallel} = v \\mu = v \\cos\\alpha$\n$v_{\\perp} = v \\sqrt{1-\\mu^2} = v \\sin\\alpha$\n$\\mathbf{v}(t) = (v_{\\perp}\\cos\\phi(t), -v_{\\perp}\\sin\\phi(t), v_{\\parallel})$\n$\\mathbf{r}(t) = (\\rho_L \\sin\\phi(t) + x_{gc}, \\rho_L \\cos\\phi(t) + y_{gc}, v_{\\parallel}t + z_0)$\n\nNow, consider a small-amplitude plane electromagnetic wave with electric field $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{E}_{0} \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)]$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. The wave propagates in the $x$-$z$ plane, so $\\mathbf{k} = k_{\\perp}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_{\\parallel}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, with $k_{\\perp} = k\\sin\\theta$ and $k_{\\parallel} = k\\cos\\theta$.\n\nA sustained, coherent energy exchange between the wave and the particle, which defines resonance, occurs when the particle experiences a force that is persistently in or out of phase with its velocity. This requires a phase-locking between the particle's motion and the wave it experiences. The particle at position $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ sees a wave with phase $\\Phi(t) = \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\omega t$. To analyze the interaction, we expand the wave field experienced by the particle into its frequency components. The phase is:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = k_{\\perp}x(t) + k_{\\parallel}z(t) - \\omega t $$\n$$ \\Phi(t) = k_{\\perp}(\\rho_L \\sin\\phi(t) + x_{gc}) + k_{\\parallel}(v_{\\parallel}t + z_0) - \\omega t $$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\Phi(t) = (k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega)t + k_{\\perp}\\rho_L\\sin\\phi(t) + (k_{\\perp}x_{gc} + k_{\\parallel}z_0) $$\nThe term $k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$ represents the Doppler shift of the wave frequency due to the particle's parallel motion. The frequency seen by an observer moving with the particle's guiding center is $\\omega' = \\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$.\n\nThe full wave field experienced by the particle is proportional to $\\exp[i\\Phi(t)]$. The term involving $\\sin\\phi(t)$ is periodic. We can use the Jacobi-Anger expansion to decompose this part of the phase into a sum over harmonics of the gyromotion:\n$$ e^{i z \\sin\\phi} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(z) e^{in\\phi} $$\nwhere $J_n(z)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order $n$, and the argument is $z = k_{\\perp}\\rho_L = k_{\\perp}v_{\\perp}/\\Omega_{rel}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the wave phase, the wave field experienced by the particle can be expressed as a superposition of modes:\n$$ e^{i\\Phi(t)} = \\left( \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(k_{\\perp}\\rho_L) e^{in\\phi(t)} \\right) e^{i(k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega)t + i\\phi_{const}} $$\nwhere $\\phi_{const}$ contains the constant phase terms. Since $\\phi(t) = \\Omega_{rel}t + \\phi_0$, this becomes:\n$$ e^{i\\Phi(t)} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} J_n(k_{\\perp}\\rho_L) e^{i(k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega + n\\Omega_{rel})t + in\\phi_0 + i\\phi_{const}} $$\nThis shows that the particle interacts not with a single frequency $\\omega$, but with a spectrum of frequencies Doppler-shifted by its parallel motion and broken into cyclotron harmonics $n$ by its perpendicular motion. Each integer $n$ corresponds to a harmonic of the interaction. The integer $n=0$ corresponds to the Landau resonance, while $n \\neq 0$ correspond to the cyclotron resonances.\n\nResonance occurs when the particle sees a static field in its oscillating frame for one of these harmonics. This means the phase of one of the harmonic components must be stationary. The \"interaction phase\" for the $n$-th harmonic is $\\Psi_n(t) = (k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega + n\\Omega_{rel})t + \\text{constants}$.\nThe condition for resonance is that the time derivative of this phase is zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Psi_n}{dt} = 0 $$\n$$ k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - \\omega + n\\Omega_{rel} = 0 $$\nThis gives the fundamental cyclotron resonance condition:\n$$ \\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} = n\\Omega_{rel} $$\n\nThis condition has a clear physical interpretation. The left side, $\\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$, is the wave frequency as seen in the reference frame of the particle's guiding center. The right side, $n\\Omega_{rel}$, is an integer multiple of the particle's relativistic gyrofrequency. Resonance occurs when the Doppler-shifted wave frequency matches an integer multiple of the particle's orbital frequency. This allows for a persistent, cumulative transfer of energy between the wave and the particle. The question asks why only the parallel component of the Doppler shift, $k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$, survives. The full Doppler shift would be $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} + k_{\\perp}\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}(t)$. The perpendicular term $\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp}$ oscillates at the gyrofrequency. Its effect is not averaged to zero; rather, its periodic nature is what gives rise to the spectrum of cyclotron harmonics $n$. The process of expanding the interaction into Fourier harmonics (the Jacobi-Anger expansion) effectively performs the \"gyro-phase averaging\" by separating the interaction into components that can lead to secular (long-term) effects. The parallel Doppler shift $k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel}$, being constant, provides a uniform shift to all harmonics.\n\nNow, we solve the resonance condition for the pitch-angle cosine, $\\mu_n(\\theta)$. We substitute the given definitions into the resonance equation $\\omega - k_{\\parallel}v_{\\parallel} - n\\Omega_{rel} = 0$:\n-   Parallel wavevector number: $k_{\\parallel} = k \\cos\\theta$\n-   Parallel particle velocity: $v_{\\parallel} = v \\mu$\n-   Relativistic gyrofrequency: $\\Omega_{rel} = \\Omega/\\gamma$\n\nThe resonance condition becomes:\n$$ \\omega - (k \\cos\\theta)(v \\mu) - n\\frac{\\Omega}{\\gamma} = 0 $$\nWe are asked to find the resonant pitch-angle cosine, which we denote as $\\mu_n(\\theta)$ to emphasize its dependence on the harmonic number $n$ and the wave propagation angle $\\theta$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $\\mu$:\n$$ (k v \\cos\\theta) \\mu = \\omega - n\\frac{\\Omega}{\\gamma} $$\nAssuming $k v \\cos\\theta \\neq 0$ (which is true since $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $k \\neq 0$, and $v \\neq 0$), we can divide to find $\\mu_n(\\theta)$:\n$$ \\mu_{n}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\omega - \\frac{n\\Omega}{\\gamma}}{k v \\cos\\theta} $$\nThis is the final expression for the resonant pitch-angle cosine for the $n$-th harmonic. For a resonance to be physically possible for a particle with total speed $v$, the required parallel speed $v_{\\parallel} = v\\mu_n(\\theta)$ must not exceed $v$. This implies that the magnitude of the pitch-angle cosine must be less than or equal to $1$, i.e., $|\\mu_n(\\theta)| \\le 1$.",

Evaluate $U_{\\rm cr}$ and Compute $\\epsilon$**\n\nWe use the given values in cgs units:\n- $n_{\\rm cr} = 1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $p_{\\min} = m_{p}c$, $p_{\\max} = 10^{5} m_{p}c$\n- $m_p c^2 \\approx 1.503 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{erg}$\n- $c \\approx 3.00 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$\n\nThe term $\\frac{p_{\\min} p_{\\max}}{p_{\\max} - p_{\\min}}$ can be approximated since $p_{\\max} \\gg p_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\min} p_{\\max}}{p_{\\max} - p_{\\min}} = \\frac{p_{\\min} p_{\\max}}{p_{\\max}(1 - p_{\\min}/p_{\\max})} \\approx p_{\\min} $$\nThe ratio $\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}} = 10^5$, so $\\ln(10^5) = 5\\ln(10) \\approx 11.513$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $U_{\\rm cr}$:\n$$ U_{\\rm cr} \\approx n_{\\rm cr} c \\times p_{\\min} \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{p_{\\min}}\\right) $$\n$$ U_{\\rm cr} \\approx n_{\\rm cr} c (m_p c) \\ln(10^5) = n_{\\rm cr} (m_p c^2) \\ln(10^5) $$\n$$ U_{\\rm cr} \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1.503 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{erg}) \\times 11.513 \\approx 1.730 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{erg/cm^3} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{u_B}{U_{\\rm cr}} \\approx \\frac{3.979 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{erg/cm^3}}{1.730 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{erg/cm^3}} \\approx 0.02299 $$\n\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\epsilon = 0.0230$.",
