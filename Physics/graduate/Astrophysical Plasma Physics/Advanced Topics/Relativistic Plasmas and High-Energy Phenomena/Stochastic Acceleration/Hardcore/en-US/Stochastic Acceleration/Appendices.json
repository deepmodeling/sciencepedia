It is a standard, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem in theoretical astrophysics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires determining the momentum scaling of the acceleration time, $t_{\\text{acc}}(p)$. This is achieved by first finding the scaling of the particle's spatial mean free path, $\\lambda(p)$, then the spatial diffusion coefficient, $\\kappa(p)$, and finally relating this to $t_{\\text{acc}}(p)$.\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path, $\\lambda(p)$**\n\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, is determined by the rate at which a particle's pitch angle is scattered. For an ultra-relativistic particle with speed $v \\approx c$, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pitch-angle scattering frequency, $\\nu_s$: $\\lambda \\approx c/\\nu_s$.\n\nThe pitch-angle scattering frequency is derived from quasi-linear theory (QLT). The pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\mu\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the cosine of the pitch angle, is given by:\n$$\nD_{\\mu\\mu} \\approx \\frac{\\pi \\Omega}{2 B_0^2} (1 - \\mu^2) k_{\\text{res}} P(k_{\\text{res}})\n$$\nThe scattering frequency $\\nu_s$ is of the order of $D_{\\mu\\mu}$ averaged over pitch angle. For a scaling analysis, we can establish the proportionality:\n$$\n\\nu_s \\propto \\Omega \\frac{k_{\\text{res}} P(k_{\\text{res}})}{B_0^2}\n$$\nWe need to find the momentum dependence of each term on the right-hand side. The background field $B_0$ is constant.\n\n-   **Resonant Wavenumber, $k_{\\text{res}}$**: Resonant scattering occurs when the particle's gyroradius, $r_g$, matches the wavelength of the turbulence, i.e., $k_{\\text{res}} \\sim 1/r_g$. Given $r_{g} = p c / (e B_{0})$, the scaling with momentum $p$ is:\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{res}} \\propto \\frac{1}{r_g} \\propto \\frac{1}{p}\n    $$\n-   **Gyrofrequency, $\\Omega$**: The relativistic gyrofrequency is $\\Omega = v/r_g \\approx c/r_g$. Its scaling is:\n    $$\n    \\Omega \\propto \\frac{1}{r_g} \\propto \\frac{1}{p}\n    $$\n-   **Turbulent Power, $P(k_{\\text{res}})$**: The power spectrum is given as $P(k) = C k^{-q}$. At the resonant wavenumber, its scaling is:\n    $$\n    P(k_{\\text{res}}) \\propto k_{\\text{res}}^{-q} \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)^{-q} = p^q\n    $$\nNow, we substitute these scalings into the expression for the scattering frequency $\\nu_s$:\n$$\n\\nu_s \\propto \\Omega \\cdot k_{\\text{res}} \\cdot P(k_{\\text{res}}) \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right) \\cdot (p^q) = p^{q-2}\n$$\nThe mean free path $\\lambda(p)$ is then:\n$$\n\\lambda(p) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_s} \\propto \\frac{1}{p^{q-2}} = p^{2-q}\n$$\n\n2.  **Spatial Diffusion Coefficient, $\\kappa(p)$**\n\nThe spatial diffusion coefficient for particles moving parallel to the magnetic field is related to the mean free path by $\\kappa(p) \\approx \\frac{1}{3} v \\lambda(p)$. Since we consider ultra-relativistic particles where $v \\approx c$ is constant, the scaling of $\\kappa(p)$ is the same as that of $\\lambda(p)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(p) \\propto \\lambda(p) \\propto p^{2-q}\n$$\n\n3.  **Acceleration Time, $t_{\\text{acc}}(p)$**\n\nSecond-order Fermi acceleration is a diffusive process in momentum space. The characteristic acceleration time is defined as $t_{\\text{acc}} = p^2 / D_{pp}$, where $D_{pp}$ is the momentum diffusion coefficient. For stochastic acceleration by Alfvén waves moving at speed $v_A$, the momentum diffusion coefficient is related to the spatial diffusion coefficient by:\n$$\nD_{pp} \\sim \\left(\\frac{v_A}{c}\\right)^2 \\frac{p^2}{\\kappa(p)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $t_{\\text{acc}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{acc}}(p) \\sim \\frac{p^2}{D_{pp}} \\sim \\frac{p^2}{\\left(\\frac{v_A}{c}\\right)^2 \\frac{p^2}{\\kappa(p)}} = \\left(\\frac{c}{v_A}\\right)^2 \\kappa(p)\n$$\nSince $c$ and $v_A$ are constants with respect to the particle momentum, the scaling of the acceleration time follows that of the spatial diffusion coefficient:\n$$\nt_{\\text{acc}}(p) \\propto \\kappa(p) \\propto p^{2-q}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the scaling relationship as $t_{\\text{acc}}(p) \\propto p^{\\alpha}$. By comparing the exponents, we find:\n$$\n\\alpha = 2-q\n$$\n\n4.  **Calculate Exponents for Specific Turbulence Models**\n\nWe now apply this general result to the two cases given in the problem.\n\n-   **Kraichnan Turbulence**: The spectral index is $q = 3/2$. The scaling exponent $\\alpha_{\\text{Kraichnan}}$ is:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{\\text{Kraichnan}} = 2 - q = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n    $$\n-   **Kolmogorov Turbulence**: The spectral index is $q = 5/3$. The scaling exponent $\\alpha_{\\text{Kolmogorov}}$ is:\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{\\text{Kolmogorov}} = 2 - q = 2 - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} - \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\nThe requested output is the pair of exponents $(\\alpha_{\\text{Kraichnan}}, \\alpha_{\\text{Kolmogorov}})$.",

This final practice explores the crucial competition between stochastic energy gains and systematic energy losses in shaping the final particle energy spectrum. By analyzing the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation that includes both processes, you will discover how their balance naturally gives rise to a high-energy cutoff in the distribution . Understanding the origin and location of this spectral feature is essential for interpreting observations of non-thermal radiation from sources like galaxy clusters and supernova remnants.",

            "problem": "Consider an isotropic population of relativistic charged particles embedded in a homogeneous, magnetized astrophysical plasma. The particles interact stochastically with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, undergoing second-order Fermi acceleration. Let the isotropic phase-space distribution be $f(p)$, where $p$ is the particle momentum. Assume the dynamics in momentum space are governed by the isotropic Fokker–Planck equation for stochastic acceleration with momentum diffusion and radiative losses,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n= \\frac{1}{p^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left[ p^{2} D_{pp}(p) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} - p^{2} \\dot{p}(p) f \\right] + Q(p) - \\frac{f}{t_{\\text{esc}}},\n$$\nwhere $D_{pp}(p)$ is the momentum diffusion coefficient, $\\dot{p}(p)$ is the systematic momentum loss rate, $Q(p)$ is an injection term localized around a low momentum $p_{0}$, and $t_{\\text{esc}}$ is a momentum-independent escape time. In many astrophysical settings with turbulence that is broad-band and approximately scale-free over the resonant range, stochastic acceleration yields a momentum diffusion coefficient of the form $D_{pp}(p) = \\alpha p^{2}$ with $\\alpha > 0$ approximately constant.

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated as sound. It is scientifically grounded in the standard theoretical framework of stochastic particle acceleration in astrophysical plasmas, specifically using the Fokker–Planck equation. The provided forms for the momentum diffusion coefficient, $D_{pp}(p) = \\alpha p^{2}$, and the momentum loss rate, $\\dot{p}(p) = - \\beta p^{2}$, are well-established approximations for second-order Fermi acceleration and radiative (synchrotron/inverse-Compton) losses for relativistic particles, respectively. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear differential equation and a set of simplifying assumptions (steady state, high-momentum limit) that allow for the derivation of a unique, meaningful asymptotic solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the particle distribution function $f(p)$ are described by the given Fokker–Planck equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n= \\frac{1}{p^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left[ p^{2} D_{pp}(p) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} - p^{2} \\dot{p}(p) f \\right] + Q(p) - \\frac{f}{t_{\\text{esc}}}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the steady-state solution, which implies $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = 0$. We are also instructed to consider the high-momentum asymptotic regime ($p \\gg p_{0}$) where the injection term is negligible ($Q(p) \\approx 0$) and to assume that particle escape is also negligible ($t_{\\text{esc}} \\to \\infty$, so $\\frac{f}{t_{\\text{esc}}} \\approx 0$). Applying these conditions simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{p^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left[ p^{2} D_{pp}(p) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} - p^{2} \\dot{p}(p) f \\right]\n$$\nMultiplying by $p^{2}$ (for $p \\neq 0$), we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ p^{2} D_{pp}(p) \\frac{df}{dp} - p^{2} \\dot{p}(p) f \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the quantity in the square brackets, which represents the net particle flux in momentum space, must be a constant. Let this constant be $S_{p}$.\n$$\nS_{p} = p^{2} D_{pp}(p) \\frac{df}{dp} - p^{2} \\dot{p}(p) f = \\text{constant}\n$$\nIn the high-momentum limit, far from any particle source at low momentum $p_{0}$, there can be no net flux of particles towards infinite momentum. Radiative losses will eventually remove particles from the system at very high momenta. Therefore, the particle flux must vanish in this limit, so the constant is zero.\n$$\np^{2} D_{pp}(p) \\frac{df}{dp} - p^{2} \\dot{p}(p) f = 0\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given forms for the diffusion coefficient, $D_{pp}(p) = \\alpha p^{2}$ (with $\\alpha > 0$), and the momentum loss rate, $\\dot{p}(p) = - \\beta p^{2}$ (with $\\beta > 0$):\n$$\np^{2} (\\alpha p^{2}) \\frac{df}{dp} - p^{2} (-\\beta p^{2}) f = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha p^{4} \\frac{df}{dp} + \\beta p^{4} f = 0\n$$\nFor non-zero momentum $p$, we can divide by $\\alpha p^{4}$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dp} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} f = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{f} = -\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} dp\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{df}{f} = -\\int \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} dp\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(f) = -\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} p + C_{1}\n$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides gives the functional form of the steady-state distribution function in the high-momentum regime:\n$$\nf(p) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} p\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C = \\exp(C_{1})$ is a normalization constant. This solution exhibits a clear exponential cutoff.\n\nNext, we explain the origin of this cutoff from first principles by comparing the characteristic timescales for acceleration and energy loss.\n\nThe characteristic acceleration time, $t_{\\text{acc}}$, is the time required for the momentum to increase by an amount of order $p$ due to stochastic interactions. It can be estimated from the diffusion coefficient as $t_{\\text{acc}} \\sim p^{2} / D_{pp}(p)$. Using the given form $D_{pp}(p) = \\alpha p^{2}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{acc}}(p) = \\frac{p^{2}}{D_{pp}(p)} = \\frac{p^{2}}{\\alpha p^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe acceleration timescale is independent of momentum.\n\nThe characteristic loss time, $t_{\\text{loss}}$, is the time over which a particle loses a significant fraction of its momentum due to radiative processes. It is defined as $t_{\\text{loss}} \\sim p / |\\dot{p}(p)|$. Using the given form $\\dot{p}(p) = -\\beta p^{2}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{loss}}(p) = \\frac{p}{|\\dot{p}(p)|} = \\frac{p}{|-\\beta p^{2}|} = \\frac{p}{\\beta p^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta p}\n$$\nThe loss timescale is inversely proportional to momentum.\n\nThe competition between these two processes determines the particle distribution.\nAt low momenta, $t_{\\text{loss}}(p) = 1/(\\beta p)$ is large, while $t_{\\text{acc}}(p) = 1/\\alpha$ is constant. For sufficiently small $p$, we have $t_{\\text{acc}} \\ll t_{\\text{loss}}$. In this regime, acceleration is much more efficient than energy loss, and particles are systematically pushed to higher momenta.\nAs momentum $p$ increases, the loss timescale $t_{\\text{loss}}(p)$ decreases. A critical momentum, which we call the cutoff momentum $p_{c}$, is reached when the loss timescale becomes equal to the acceleration timescale. At and beyond this momentum, particles lose energy as fast as they gain it, which effectively prevents them from being accelerated further. This creates a sharp suppression, or cutoff, in the particle distribution.\n\nFinally, we determine the cutoff momentum $p_{c}$ by equating the acceleration and loss timescales:\n$$\nt_{\\text{acc}}(p_{c}) = t_{\\text{loss}}(p_{c})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the timescales:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\beta p_{c}}\n$$\nSolving for $p_{c}$ gives:\n$$\n\\beta p_{c} = \\alpha\n$$\n$$\np_{c} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the exponential cutoff derived from the Fokker-Planck equation, $f(p) \\propto \\exp(-p/p_{c})$, where a comparison of exponents shows that the characteristic momentum scale is indeed $p_{c} = \\alpha/\\beta$.",
