Since $B_\\phi = 0$, the relation $\\frac{r\\sin\\theta\\,d\\phi}{B_\\phi}$ implies that $d\\phi=0$ for a finite displacement. This means the field lines lie in meridional planes (planes of constant $\\phi$).\n\nWe consider the relation between the $r$ and $\\theta$ components:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{r\\,d\\theta}{B_\\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $B_r$ and $B_\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{\\left(\\frac{2\\mathcal{M}\\cos\\theta}{r^{3}}\\right)} = \\frac{r\\,d\\theta}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{M}\\sin\\theta}{r^{3}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe terms $\\mathcal{M}$ and $r^3$ cancel from the denominators, simplifying the equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{2\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{r\\,d\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it to separate the variables $r$ and $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{r} = 2\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\,d\\theta\n$$\nWe integrate both sides:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{dr}{r} = \\int 2\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\,d\\theta\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\ln(r) = 2\\ln(\\sin\\theta) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Note that since $r>0$ and $\\sin\\theta \\ge 0$ in the northern hemisphere (and we can extend by symmetry), we can omit the absolute value signs. Rearranging using properties of logarithms:\n$$\n\\ln(r) = \\ln(\\sin^2\\theta) + C\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the general equation for a field line:\n$$\nr = \\exp(\\ln(\\sin^2\\theta) + C) = \\exp(C) \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\nLet's define a new constant $C_0 = \\exp(C)$. The field line equation is $r = C_0 \\sin^2\\theta$.\n\nNow we relate this to the magnetic latitude $\\lambda$ and the McIlwain $L$ parameter. We are given $\\lambda = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta$, which implies $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\lambda$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\nr = C_0 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\lambda\\right) = C_0 \\cos^2\\lambda\n$$\nThe constant $C_0$ can be identified by considering the equatorial crossing of the field line. At the magnetic equator, $\\lambda=0$ and $r=r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Substituting these values into our equation:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eq}} = C_0 \\cos^2(0) = C_0 (1)^2 = C_0\n$$\nThus, the constant of integration $C_0$ is the equatorial crossing distance $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The field line equation is:\n$$\nr = r_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\cos^2\\lambda\n$$\nFinally, we use the definition of the McIlwain $L$ parameter, $L \\equiv r_{\\mathrm{eq}}/R_E$, where $R_E$ is Earth's mean radius. This gives $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = L R_E$. Substituting this into the field line equation gives the desired relation:\n$$\nr = L R_E \\cos^2\\lambda\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the L-value**\n\nWe are given a point in the magnetosphere with geocentric distance $r = 3R_E$ and magnetic latitude $\\lambda = 30^{\\circ}$. We use the equation derived in Task 1 to solve for the $L$ value of the field line passing through this point.\nThe equation is $r = L R_E \\cos^2\\lambda$. We can rearrange this to solve for $L$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{r}{R_E \\cos^2\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $r=3R_E$ and $\\lambda=30^{\\circ}$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{3R_E}{R_E \\cos^2(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{3}{\\cos^2(30^{\\circ})}\n$$\nThe value of $\\cos(30^{\\circ})$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, $\\cos^2(30^{\\circ}) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $L$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{3}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 3 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4\n$$\nThe McIlwain $L$ value of the field line is $4$.\n\n**Task 3: Verification of Consistency**\n\nWe need to verify consistency with equatorial mapping.\nFrom Task 2, we found that the field line passing through ($r=3R_E$, $\\lambda=30^{\\circ}$) has an $L$ value of $L=4$.\nUsing the definition of the $L$ parameter, we find the equatorial crossing distance $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for this field line:\n$$\nL = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{R_E} \\implies r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = L R_E = 4 R_E\n$$\nNow we check if the general field line equation, $r = r_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\cos^2\\lambda$, is satisfied by the given point ($r=3R_E$, $\\lambda=30^{\\circ}$) and the calculated $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 4R_E$.\nWe substitute $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and $\\lambda$ into the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\cos^2\\lambda = (4R_E)\\cos^2(30^{\\circ})\n$$\nAs calculated before, $\\cos^2(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\cos^2\\lambda = (4R_E) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = 3R_E\n$$\nThis result, $3R_E$, is precisely the given radial distance $r$ of the point. The relation $r = r_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\cos^2\\lambda$ holds true, confirming the consistency of our calculations.\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of $L$.",

Before proceeding to a solution, the problem statement is validated.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- An energetic electron is trapped on a closed drift shell.\n- The McIlwain L-parameter, $L$, is fixed.\n- The equatorial magnetic field magnitude at the shell is denoted by $B_{eq}$.\n- $B_{eq}$ increases slowly and monotonically over a time scale $\\tau$.\n- $\\tau$ is long compared to the electron's gyration period.\n- $\\tau$ is short compared to the electron's collisional scattering time.\n- There is no parallel electric field.\n- Guiding-center theory applies.\n- The first adiabatic invariant (magnetic moment), $\\mu$, is conserved.\n- The first task is to determine how the perpendicular kinetic energy, $E_{\\perp}$, responds to a small fractional increase in the equatorial magnetic field, $\\Delta B$.\n- The second task is to compute the multiplicative betatron energy gain factor, $E_{\\perp,f}/E_{\\perp,i}$, for a fractional increase $\\Delta B / B_{eq} = 0.20$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Soundness**: The problem describes betatron acceleration of a charged particle in a magnetosphere, a fundamental process in plasma astrophysics. The key condition—a slow change in the magnetic field relative to the gyration period—is the standard requirement for the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant. All premises are consistent with established principles of plasma physics and guiding-center theory.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is specified with sufficient information to yield a unique solution. The conservation of the magnetic moment provides a direct and unambiguous relationship between the quantities of interest ($E_{\\perp}$ and $B_{eq}$).\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from magnetospheric physics and is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is predicated on the fundamental principle stated in the problem: the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant, or magnetic moment, $\\mu$. This principle holds because the magnetic field changes on a time scale that is much longer than the particle's gyration period, making the change \"adiabatic\" with respect to the gyromotion.\n\nThe magnetic moment, $\\mu$, for a charged particle is defined as the ratio of its kinetic energy perpendicular to the magnetic field, $E_{\\perp}$, to the magnitude of the local magnetic field, $B$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{E_{\\perp}}{B}\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\perp}^2$, with $m$ being the electron mass and $v_{\\perp}$ the component of its velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field vector.\n\nThe conservation of $\\mu$ implies that this ratio remains constant throughout the evolution of the system. Therefore, the perpendicular kinetic energy $E_{\\perp}$ must change in direct proportion to the magnetic field strength $B$.\n$$\nE_{\\perp} = \\mu B \\implies E_{\\perp} \\propto B\n$$\nThis directly addresses the first part of the problem. For a small change in the magnetic field, from $B$ to $B + \\Delta B$, the perpendicular energy changes from $E_{\\perp}$ to $E_{\\perp} + \\Delta E_{\\perp}$. The relationship implies that the fractional changes are equal:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\perp}}{E_{\\perp}} = \\frac{\\Delta B}{B}\n$$\nThis energization mechanism is known as betatron acceleration.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we compare the initial state (subscript $i$) and the final state (subscript $f$) of the electron. The problem specifies that the change occurs in the equatorial magnetic field, $B_{eq}$. The conservation of the magnetic moment is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{E_{\\perp,i}}{B_{eq,i}} = \\frac{E_{\\perp,f}}{B_{eq,f}}\n$$\nHere, $E_{\\perp,i}$ and $B_{eq,i}$ are the initial perpendicular kinetic energy and equatorial magnetic field, respectively, and $E_{\\perp,f}$ and $B_{eq,f}$ are their final values. We are asked to compute the multiplicative betatron energy gain factor, defined as the ratio $E_{\\perp,f}/E_{\\perp,i}$. Rearranging the conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\perp,f}}{E_{\\perp,i}} = \\frac{B_{eq,f}}{B_{eq,i}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the fractional increase in the equatorial magnetic field is $0.20$. This fractional increase is defined relative to the initial field strength:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta B}{B_{eq}} = \\frac{B_{eq,f} - B_{eq,i}}{B_{eq,i}} = 0.20\n$$\nWe can solve this equation for the ratio of the final to initial magnetic field strengths:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{eq,f}}{B_{eq,i}} - 1 = 0.20\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{B_{eq,f}}{B_{eq,i}} = 1 + 0.20 = 1.20\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the energy gain factor, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\perp,f}}{E_{\\perp,i}} = 1.20\n$$\nThus, a $20\\%$ increase in the equatorial magnetic field strength results in a $20\\%$ increase in the electron's perpendicular kinetic energy. The multiplicative energy gain factor is $1.20$.",

This is a classic problem in magnetospheric plasma physics.\n\n**1. Foundational Principles**\n\nThe evolution of a distribution of particles in phase space is governed by the Boltzmann equation. For the collisionless plasma of the magnetosphere, this reduces to the Vlasov equation for the phase space density $f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{p}, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} f + q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{p}} f = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}$ is position, $\\mathbf{p}$ is momentum, $t$ is time, $\\mathbf{v}$ is velocity, $q$ is charge, and $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields. Liouville's theorem, a consequence of this equation for a Hamiltonian system, states that the PSD is conserved along a particle's trajectory in phase space ($df/dt = 0$).\n\nFor particles trapped in a planetary magnetic field, it is convenient to transform from $(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{p})$ to a set of coordinates based on adiabatic invariants, which are approximately conserved quantities associated with the three periodic components of particle motion:\n1.  The first adiabatic invariant, $\\mu$, is related to the fast gyromotion around a magnetic field line.\n2.  The second adiabatic invariant, $J$, is related to the bounce motion between magnetic mirror points.\n3.  The third adiabatic invariant, $\\Phi_d$, is related to the slow drift motion around the Earth. The McIlwain $L$-shell parameter is a proxy for this, with $\\Phi_d \\propto 1/L$ in a dipole field.\n\nIn these coordinates, the PSD is expressed as $f(\\mu, J, L, t)$. If all invariants were perfectly conserved, $f$ would be constant for a given particle population. However, wave-particle interactions can violate these invariants, leading to transport in phase space.\n\n**2. Derivation of the 1D Radial Diffusion Equation**\n\nWhen interactions with waves cause small, random changes in the invariants, the evolution of the PSD is no longer described by the simple Vlasov equation but by a Fokker-Planck equation, which accounts for stochastic transport. The general form is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha_i} \\left( D_{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha_j} \\right) - \\mathcal{L} + \\mathcal{S}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j \\in \\{\\mu, J, L\\}$ are the invariant coordinates, $D_{ij}$ are the elements of the diffusion tensor, $\\mathcal{L}$ is a loss operator, and $\\mathcal{S}$ is a source operator.\n\nThe problem requires us to reduce this general equation to a one-dimensional equation in $L$ and $t$. This reduction is justified by the following assumptions:\n\n*   **Fixed Particle Population**: We consider the PSD at fixed first and second invariants, $\\mu$ and $J$. This means we are analyzing a specific population of electrons (e.g., those with a fixed energy and equatorial pitch angle at a given $L$-shell). This eliminates diffusion in $\\mu$ and $J$ from our direct consideration, and $f$ becomes a function $f(L,t)$.\n*   **Dominance of Radial Diffusion**: The problem specifies that radial transport is driven by magnetohydrodynamic Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) waves. These waves have frequencies comparable to the particle drift frequencies (minutes to tens of minutes). Resonant interaction with these waves primarily violates the third adiabatic invariant, causing particles to diffuse across $L$-shells. We assume this is the dominant transport mechanism.\n*   **Simplified Loss Term**: Pitch-angle scattering by other waves (e.g., Whistler-mode chorus or hiss) violates $\\mu$ and $J$, scattering particles into the atmospheric loss cone. Instead of modeling the complex diffusion in pitch-angle space, this process is simplified to a single loss term, $\\mathcal{L} = f/\\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a characteristic loss timescale. This is a valid approximation if the timescale for precipitation is much faster than the timescale for scattering back out of the loss cone.\n*   **Simplified Diffusion Operator**: The formal expression for radial diffusion flux conservation leads to a term like $L^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left( \\frac{D_{LL}}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} \\right)$. However, the problem specifies the analysis is for a \"narrow range of $L$\" and assumes a \"spatially uniform radial diffusion coefficient\" ($D_{LL}$). Under this local approximation, the geometric factor $L^2$ is treated as constant and can be absorbed into an effective diffusion coefficient, simplifying the operator to $D_{LL} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial L^2}$.\n\nWith these justifications and assumptions (constant $D_{LL}$ and $\\tau$), the full Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation for $f(L,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = D_{LL} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial L^2} - \\frac{f}{\\tau} + S(L,t)\n$$\nwhere $S(L,t)$ is a source term.\n\n**3. Solution for an Impulsive Source**\n\nThe problem asks for the solution after a substorm-associated injection, modeled as an \"impulsive source concentrated at $L \\approx 6$, occurring at $t=0$\". This corresponds to an instantaneous source, which sets the initial condition for the evolution at $t > 0$. We model this as:\n$$\nf(L, t=0^+) = A \\, \\delta(L-L_0)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the injection, $L_0 = 6.0$ is the injection location, and $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function. For $t > 0$, the source term $S(L,t)$ is zero, and we must solve the homogeneous PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = D_{LL} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial L^2} - \\frac{f}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis is a standard linear partial differential equation. We can simplify it by making the substitution $f(L,t) = g(L,t) e^{-t/\\tau}$. Differentiating and substituting into the PDE, we find that the loss terms cancel:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} e^{-t/\\tau} - \\frac{g}{\\tau} e^{-t/\\tau}\\right) = D_{LL} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial L^2} e^{-t/\\tau}\\right) - \\frac{g e^{-t/\\tau}}{\\tau}\n$$\n$$\n\\implies \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t} = D_{LL} \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial L^2}\n$$\nThis is the standard heat or diffusion equation. The initial condition for $g$ is $g(L,0) = f(L,0) e^0 = A \\, \\delta(L-L_0)$.\n\nThe solution to the heat equation on an unbounded domain ($-\\infty < L < \\infty$) for a delta-function initial condition is its Green's function, which is a Gaussian:\n$$\ng(L,t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D_{LL} t}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(L-L_0)^2}{4 D_{LL} t} \\right)\n$$\nThe exponential term describes the diffusive spreading of the initial impulse, while the pre-factor ensures conservation of the total quantity $\\int g(L,t) \\, dL = A$.\n\nFinally, we transform back to the original function $f(L,t)$ by multiplying by the decay factor $e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n\n**4. Final Expression for $f(L,t)$**\n\nThe closed-form expression for the phase space density $f(L,t)$ following an impulsive injection is the product of the diffusion solution and the loss term:\n$$\nf(L,t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D_{LL} t}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(L-L_0)^2}{4 D_{LL} t} \\right) e^{-t/\\tau}\n$$\nThis can be combined into a single expression:\n$$\nf(L,t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi D_{LL} t}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(L-L_0)^2}{4 D_{LL} t} - \\frac{t}{\\tau} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation provides the PSD at any evaluation point $(L,t)$ given the injection amplitude $A$, injection location $L_0$, radial diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$, and loss timescale $\\tau$.
