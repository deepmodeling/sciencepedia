            "problem": "A Kerr black hole of mass $M$ with dimensionless spin parameter $a \\ll 1$ is threaded by a large-scale, stationary, axisymmetric, magnetically dominated, force-free magnetosphere. Let $r_H$ denote the black hole horizon radius and let $B_H$ denote the characteristic magnitude of the magnetic field measured just outside the horizon by a locally non-rotating observer.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics, specifically the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information and constraints to determine the required leading-order scaling relation through dimensional and symmetry analysis. The language used is objective and precise.\n\nThe objective is to determine the electromagnetic power, $P$, extracted from a Kerr black hole as a function of the horizon magnetic field, $B_H$, the horizon radius, $r_H$, and the dimensionless spin parameter, $a$, in the small-spin limit ($a \\ll 1$). The derivation will rely solely on dimensional analysis and fundamental physical symmetries. We work in geometrized units where the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to unity, i.e., $G=c=1$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the dimensions of the relevant physical quantities in this system of units. In geometrized units, mass, length, and time all share the same dimension, which we denote as $[L]$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Power, $P$, is defined as energy per unit time. Energy has dimensions of mass, which in geometrized units is length. Time also has dimensions of length. Therefore, power is dimensionless: $[P] = [\\text{Energy}]/[\\text{Time}] = [M]/[T] = [L]/[L] = 1$.\n    \\item The horizon radius, $r_H$, is a length, so its dimension is $[r_H] = [L]$.\n    \\item The spin parameter, $a$, is explicitly stated to be dimensionless, so $[a] = 1$.\n    \\item The magnetic field, $B_H$. The energy density of an electromagnetic field is proportional to the square of the field strength, $B^2$. The stress-energy tensor, $T^{\\mu\\nu}$, has components representing energy density. The dimensions of energy density are $[\\text{Energy}]/[\\text{Volume}] = [M]/[L^3] = [L]/[L^3] = [L]^{-2}$. Since the components of the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\text{EM}}$ scale as $B^2$, we must have $[B_H^2] = [L]^{-2}$. This implies that the dimension of the magnetic field is $[B_H] = [L]^{-1}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe seek a monomial expression for the power $P$ of the form:\n$$P = \\kappa B_H^{\\alpha} r_H^{\\beta} a^{\\gamma}$$\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are exponents to be determined, and $\\kappa$ is a dimensionless coefficient that accounts for all factors not fixed by this analysis.\n\nWe apply dimensional analysis to this equation:\n$$[P] = [\\kappa] [B_H]^{\\alpha} [r_H]^{\\beta} [a]^{\\gamma}$$\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$$1 = (1) ([L]^{-1})^{\\alpha} ([L])^{\\beta} (1)^{\\gamma}$$\n$$[L]^0 = [L]^{-\\alpha + \\beta}$$\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the exponent of $[L]$ must be zero. This gives us the constraint:\n$$-\\alpha + \\beta = 0 \\implies \\alpha = \\beta$$\n\nNext, we incorporate physical reasoning based on the problem's assumptions.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The problem describes an electromagnetic energy-extraction mechanism. The source of the energy is the rotational energy of the black hole, but the medium for its extraction is the electromagnetic field. The power extracted must therefore scale with the total electromagnetic energy available, which is related to the energy density of the magnetic field. The energy density is proportional to $B_H^2$. Consequently, the power $P$ must be proportional to $B_H^2$. This fixes the exponent $\\alpha=2$.\n    \\item From our dimensional constraint $\\alpha = \\beta$, it immediately follows that $\\beta=2$.\n    \\item The Blandford-Znajek mechanism relies on the rotation of the black hole, which is parameterized by the spin $a$. A non-rotating black hole ($a=0$) has a static spacetime (Schwarzschild), and by the laws of black hole mechanics, its energy (mass) cannot be reduced through classical processes. Therefore, the power extracted must be zero when $a=0$, i.e., $P(a=0)=0$.\n    \\item Furthermore, the total radiated power is an intrinsically positive quantity representing a flow of energy away from the black hole. It should not depend on the direction of the black hole's spin (i.e., the sign of $a$). A functional dependence of $P \\propto a$ would be unphysical as it would imply the sign of the power flow changes with the spin's direction. The leading-order dependence on $a$ for small $a$ must therefore be an even power of $a$. Since $P(a=0) = 0$, the lowest possible non-zero power in the expansion of $P(a)$ around $a=0$ is $a^2$. This fixes the exponent $\\gamma=2$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nCombining these results, we find the exponents $\\alpha=2$, $\\beta=2$, and $\\gamma=2$. The leading-order dependence of the electromagnetic power on the given quantities is:\n$$P = \\kappa B_H^2 r_H^2 a^2$$\n\nThe dimensionless coefficient $\\kappa$ encapsulates the details of the process that cannot be determined by dimensional analysis alone. Its physical meaning relates to factors that modulate the efficiency of the energy extraction. Specifically, $\\kappa$ accounts for:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The geometry of the magnetic field. The power depends on the integral of the magnetic flux over the horizon, and not just on a single characteristic value $B_H$. Different field configurations (e.g., split-monopole versus parabolic) result in different values of $\\kappa$.\n    \\item The angular velocity of the magnetic field lines, $\\Omega_F$. The power extraction depends on the 'slip' between the horizon's angular velocity $\\Omega_H$ and $\\Omega_F$. The power is typically proportional to a factor of $(\\Omega_F/\\Omega_H)(1 - \\Omega_F/\\Omega_H)$, which is maximized for $\\Omega_F = \\Omega_H/2$. This factor is absorbed into $\\kappa$.\n    \\item The properties of the astrophysical 'load' at a large distance, which the magnetic field lines connect to. This load determines the value of $\\Omega_F$ and the overall impedance of the magnetospheric circuit, thereby affecting the total power output.\n    \\item Any dimensionless numerical factors (e.g., $1/(2\\pi)$, $1/6$) that arise from a full integration of the energy flux over the horizon surface.\n\\end{itemize}\nIn summary, $\\kappa$ represents the overall efficiency of the Blandford-Znajek process for a given magnetic field structure and astrophysical environment.\n\nThe final expression for the leading-order electromagnetic power is derived from the established dependencies.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System**: Steady, axisymmetric, force-free magnetosphere powered by the Blandford–Znajek mechanism.\n- **Approximation**: The large-scale poloidal magnetic field far from the black hole is approximated by a split-monopole configuration.\n- **Coordinates**: Spherical coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$.\n- **Poloidal Magnetic Field**: $\\vec{B} = B_r \\hat{r}$, with $B_r(r,\\theta) = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta)$ and $B_{\\theta}(r,\\theta)=0$.\n- **Constants**: $B_0$ and $r_0$ are constants.\n- **Function**: $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cdot)$ is the sign function.\n- **Equatorial Plane**: At $\\theta=\\pi/2$, there is a razor-thin current sheet.\n- **Assumptions for calculation**: Neglect any toroidal field ($B_{\\phi}=0$) and electric field ($\\vec{E}=\\vec{0}$).\n- **Task 1**: Show why an equatorial current sheet must form.\n- **Task 2**: Compute the surface current density $\\vec{K}$ required to sustain the reversal of $B_r$.\n- **Final Answer Requirement**: A single analytic expression for the magnitude of the surface current density, $K$, as a function of $r$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses a standard, albeit simplified, model (the split-monopole field) in the context of black hole astrophysics and the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. The underlying physics relies on Maxwell's equations and their boundary conditions, which are fundamental principles of electromagnetism. The setup is a valid idealization used in theoretical astrophysics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a well-defined magnetic field configuration and asks for the physical source (a surface current) required to sustain it.

No flaws are identified. The apparent contradiction of a \"force-free\" magnetosphere with a field that might not be force-free is resolved by recognizing that the problem focuses on calculating the source for the given static field, an essential step before analyzing the full plasma dynamics. The curl of the given field is indeed zero everywhere except at the equator, which is consistent with the current being confined to a sheet.\n\n### Step 3: Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, demonstrating the necessity of a current sheet, and second, calculating its density.\n\n**Part 1: Justification for the Equatorial Current Sheet**\n\nIn a steady state, the relationship between magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ is given by Ampere's Law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. A non-zero current density must exist in any region where the magnetic field has a non-zero curl.\n\nThe given magnetic field is $\\vec{B}(r, \\theta) = B_r(r, \\theta) \\hat{r}$, with $B_r = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta)$, and $B_\\theta = B_\\phi = 0$. We compute the curl of $\\vec{B}$ in spherical coordinates. The general form of the curl is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta}(\\sin\\theta B_{\\phi}) - \\frac{\\partial B_{\\theta}}{\\partial\\phi} \\right] \\hat{r} + \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial B_r}{\\partial\\phi} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r B_{\\phi}) \\right] \\hat{\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r B_{\\theta}) - \\frac{\\partial B_r}{\\partial\\theta} \\right] \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\nSubstituting $B_\\theta=0$, $B_\\phi=0$, and noting that $B_r$ is independent of $\\phi$ (due to axisymmetry), the expression for the curl simplifies significantly to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = -\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial B_r}{\\partial\\theta} \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\nLet's analyze the derivative $\\frac{\\partial B_r}{\\partial\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_r}{\\partial\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} \\left[ B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta) \\right] = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} (\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta))\n$$\nThe sign function, $\\mathrm{sgn}(x)$, is piecewise constant. For $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2)$, $\\cos\\theta > 0$, so $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta)=1$. For $\\theta \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi]$, $\\cos\\theta < 0$, so $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta)=-1$. In these open intervals, the function is constant with respect to $\\theta$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} (\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos\\theta)) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } \\theta \\neq \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, for all points not on the equatorial plane, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\vec{0}$. This implies that the volume current density $\\vec{J} = \\vec{0}$ everywhere except possibly at the equator, $\\theta = \\pi/2$.\n\nAt the equator itself, the function $B_r(r, \\theta)$ is discontinuous. As $\\theta$ approaches $\\pi/2$ from the northern hemisphere ($\\theta \\to (\\pi/2)^-$), $B_r$ approaches $B_{0}(r_{0}/r)^{2}$. As $\\theta$ approaches $\\pi/2$ from the southern hemisphere ($\\theta \\to (\\pi/2)^+$), $B_r$ approaches $-B_{0}(r_{0}/r)^{2}$. This jump discontinuity means the derivative $\\frac{\\partial B_r}{\\partial\\theta}$ is singular at $\\theta=\\pi/2$, mathematically corresponding to a Dirac delta function. A curl that is zero everywhere except for a singularity on a surface indicates the presence of a surface current density $\\vec{K}$ on that surface. Thus, the reversal of the radial magnetic field across the equator necessitates the existence of an equatorial current sheet.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Surface Current Density**\n\nTo find the surface current density $\\vec{K}$, we use the boundary condition for the magnetic field across a surface hosting a current:\n$$\n\\hat{n} \\times (\\vec{B}_2 - \\vec{B}_1) = \\mu_0 \\vec{K}\n$$\nHere, the surface is the equatorial plane $\\theta=\\pi/2$. We define region 1 as the southern hemisphere ($\\theta > \\pi/2$) and region 2 as the northern hemisphere ($\\theta < \\pi/2$). The unit normal vector $\\hat{n}$ points from region 1 to region 2. In spherical coordinates at the equator, this vector points in the direction of decreasing $\\theta$, so $\\hat{n} = -\\hat{\\theta}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the magnetic fields on either side of the boundary:\n- $\\vec{B}_2$ is the field in region 2, evaluated at the boundary:\n$$\n\\vec{B}_2 = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\vec{B}(r, \\theta=\\pi/2-\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos(\\pi/2-\\epsilon)) \\hat{r} = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} (+1) \\hat{r} = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{r}\n$$\n- $\\vec{B}_1$ is the field in region 1, evaluated at the boundary:\n$$\n\\vec{B}_1 = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\vec{B}(r, \\theta=\\pi/2+\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\cos(\\pi/2+\\epsilon)) \\hat{r} = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} (-1) \\hat{r} = -B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{r}\n$$\n\nThe difference in the magnetic field across the boundary is:\n$$\n\\vec{B}_2 - \\vec{B}_1 = B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{r} - \\left(-B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{r}\\right) = 2 B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{r}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these results into the boundary condition equation:\n$$\n\\mu_0 \\vec{K} = \\hat{n} \\times (\\vec{B}_2 - \\vec{B}_1) = (-\\hat{\\theta}) \\times \\left(2 B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{r}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the right-hand rule for the spherical coordinate basis vectors, we have $\\hat{\\theta} \\times \\hat{r} = -\\hat{\\phi}$. Therefore, $(-\\hat{\\theta}) \\times \\hat{r} = -(-\\hat{\\phi}) = \\hat{\\phi}$.\n$$\n\\mu_0 \\vec{K} = 2 B_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\nSolving for the surface current density vector $\\vec{K}$:\n$$\n\\vec{K}(r) = \\frac{2 B_{0}}{\\mu_0} \\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2} \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\nThe current is purely azimuthal, which is consistent with creating a poloidal magnetic field structure that is symmetric about the polar axis.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this surface current density, which is denoted by $K = |\\vec{K}|$.\n$$\nK(r) = \\frac{2 B_{0}}{\\mu_0} \\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThis expression gives the required surface current density in amperes per meter needed to support the split-monopole magnetic field configuration.",

It is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation.\n\nWe are working in geometrized units where $G=c=1$. The spacetime is that of a slowly-rotating Kerr black hole, which allows us to treat the event horizon as a sphere of radius $r_H$ rotating with angular velocity $\\Omega_H$. The horizon is threaded by an axisymmetric, stationary, force-free magnetosphere. The magnetic field lines corotate with a constant angular velocity $\\Omega_F$.

The law relates the tangential electric field in the frame of the membrane, $\\vec{E'}$, to the surface current density, $\\vec{K}$, via $\\vec{E'}_{tan} = R_H \\vec{K}$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the electric field. In a stationary, axisymmetric, force-free magnetosphere, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ in the frame of a Zero-Angular-Momentum-Observer (ZAMO, which is stationary with respect to distant stars) is given by the ideal MHD condition $\\vec{E} + \\vec{v}_F \\times \\vec{B} = 0$, where $\\vec{v}_F$ is the velocity of the field lines. Given that the field lines rotate with angular velocity $\\Omega_F$, the velocity at a position $\\vec{r}$ is $\\vec{v}_F = \\vec{\\Omega}_F \\times \\vec{r}$, which on the horizon sphere has a magnitude $v_F = \\Omega_F r_H \\sin\\theta$ in the $\\hat{\\phi}$ direction.\nThe electric field in the ZAMO frame is thus $\\vec{E} = -\\vec{v}_F \\times \\vec{B}$.\nThe horizon itself is rotating with angular velocity $\\Omega_H$, so a point on the horizon has velocity $\\vec{v}_H = \\Omega_H r_H \\sin\\theta \\hat{\\phi}$ with respect to the ZAMO frame.\nThe electric field in the frame comoving with the horizon, $\\vec{E'}$, is given by the standard Lorentz transformation:\n$$\n\\vec{E'} = \\vec{E} + \\vec{v}_H \\times \\vec{B}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\vec{E}$:\n$$\n\\vec{E'} = (-\\vec{v}_F \\times \\vec{B}) + (\\vec{v}_H \\times \\vec{B}) = (\\vec{v}_H - \\vec{v}_F) \\times \\vec{B}\n$$\nThe relative velocity is purely toroidal: $\\vec{v}_H - \\vec{v}_F = (\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F) r_H \\sin\\theta \\hat{\\phi}$. The magnetic field has a poloidal component $\\vec{B}_p = B_r \\hat{r} + B_\\theta \\hat{\\theta}$.

By comparing the $\\hat{\\theta}$ components, we find:\n$$\n-B_\\phi = 4\\pi K_\\theta \\implies B_\\phi = -4\\pi K_\\theta = -(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) r_H \\sin\\theta B_r\n$$\nThe poloidal current $I(\\Psi)$ flowing within a flux surface $\\Psi$ is related to the toroidal magnetic field $B_\\phi$ at that surface by the integrated form of Ampere's law in axisymmetry: $4\\pi I(\\Psi) = \\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = B_\\phi \\cdot (2\\pi \\varpi)$, where $\\varpi = r_H \\sin\\theta$ is the cylindrical radius.\n$$\nI(\\Psi) = \\frac{2\\pi r_H \\sin\\theta B_\\phi}{4\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2} r_H \\sin\\theta B_\\phi\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $B_\\phi$:\n$$\nI(\\Psi) = \\frac{1}{2} r_H \\sin\\theta \\big[ -(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) r_H \\sin\\theta B_r \\big] = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) r_H^2 \\sin^2\\theta B_r\n$$\nFinally, we use the given definition of the magnetic flux function $\\Psi(\\theta)$, which is $\\partial_\\theta \\Psi(\\theta) = 2\\pi r_H^2 B_r(\\theta)\\sin\\theta$. We can express $B_r$ in terms of $\\partial_\\theta \\Psi$:\n$$\nB_r = \\frac{\\partial_\\theta \\Psi}{2\\pi r_H^2 \\sin\\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I(\\Psi)$:\n$$\nI(\\Psi) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) r_H^2 \\sin^2\\theta \\left( \\frac{\\partial_\\theta \\Psi}{2\\pi r_H^2 \\sin\\theta} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) \\sin\\theta \\partial_\\theta \\Psi\n$$\nThis is the Znajek regularity relation, expressing the poloidal current $I$ in terms of the horizon and field line properties. We can write it as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F) \\sin\\theta \\partial_\\theta \\Psi\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Differential Jet Power\n\nThe jet power is carried away from the black hole by the Poynting flux. The Poynting vector is given by $\\vec{S} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\vec{E} \\times \\vec{B}$. We are interested in the radially outward component, $S_r$, at the horizon. In stationary, axisymmetric FFE, $S_r = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}E_\\theta B_\\phi$.\nAt the horizon, the ZAMO-frame poloidal electric field is $E_\\theta = \\Omega_F r_H \\sin\\theta B_r$, and the toroidal magnetic field is $B_\\phi = -(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) r_H \\sin\\theta B_r$, as found in Part 1. Substituting these into the expression for $S_r$:\n$$ S_r = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} (\\Omega_F r_H \\sin\\theta B_r) \\cdot \\big(-(\\Omega_F - \\Omega_H) r_H \\sin\\theta B_r\\big) = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{4\\pi} (r_H \\sin\\theta B_r)^2 $$\nFor power to be extracted from the black hole ($S_r > 0$), we require $\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F) > 0$, which is satisfied for $0  \\Omega_F  \\Omega_H$.\nThe differential jet power per unit solid angle is $dP/d\\Omega = S_r r_H^2$.\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = S_r r_H^2 = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{4\\pi} (r_H \\sin\\theta B_r)^2 r_H^2 = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{4\\pi} (r_H^2 \\sin\\theta B_r)^2 $$\nThe problem asks for this quantity in terms of $\\Omega_F$, $\\Omega_H$, and $\\partial_\\theta \\Psi$. We use the relation $\\partial_\\theta \\Psi = 2\\pi r_H^2 B_r \\sin\\theta$, which gives $r_H^2 B_r \\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\partial_\\theta \\Psi$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $dP/d\\Omega$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\partial_\\theta \\Psi}{2\\pi} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{16\\pi^3} (\\partial_\\theta \\Psi)^2 $$\nThis is the desired expression for the differential jet power per unit solid angle.\n\n### Part 3: Jet Power for a Specific Flux Distribution\n\nWe are given the flux distribution:\n$$\n\\Psi(\\theta) = 2\\pi B_0 r_H^2 \\big[(1-\\cos\\theta) + \\varepsilon \\sin^2\\theta\\big]\n$$\nFirst, we compute its derivative with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\partial_\\theta \\Psi = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( 2\\pi B_0 r_H^2 \\big[1-\\cos\\theta + \\varepsilon \\sin^2\\theta\\big] \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_\\theta \\Psi = 2\\pi B_0 r_H^2 \\left[ \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(1-\\cos\\theta) + \\varepsilon \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(\\sin^2\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivatives are $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}(1-\\cos\\theta) = \\sin\\theta$ and $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}(\\sin^2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$.\n$$\n\\partial_\\theta \\Psi = 2\\pi B_0 r_H^2 (\\sin\\theta + 2\\varepsilon \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta) = 2\\pi B_0 r_H^2 \\sin\\theta (1 + 2\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\partial_\\theta \\Psi$ into our result from Part 2:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{16\\pi^3} (\\partial_\\theta \\Psi)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{16\\pi^3} \\left[ 2\\pi B_0 r_H^2 \\sin\\theta (1 + 2\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta) \\right]^2\n$$\nSquaring the term in the brackets:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F)}{16\\pi^3} \\left[ 4\\pi^2 B_0^2 r_H^4 \\sin^2\\theta (1 + 2\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta)^2 \\right]\n$$\nFinally, we simplify the numerical and $\\pi$ factors:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{16\\pi^3} B_0^2 r_H^4 \\Omega_F(\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F) \\sin^2\\theta (1 + 2\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} B_0^2 r_H^4 \\Omega_F (\\Omega_H - \\Omega_F) \\sin^2\\theta (1 + 2\\varepsilon \\cos\\theta)^2\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the jet power per unit solid angle as a function of the specified parameters.",
