            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the critical radius for a smooth transonic solution in Parker's model of a stellar wind, its numerical evaluation for solar parameters, and a physical explanation for its location.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics for a steady, spherically symmetric flow.\n\nThe equation of mass conservation (continuity equation) states that the mass outflow rate $\\dot{M}$ is constant:\n$$ \\dot{M} = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho v = \\text{constant} $$\nwhere $r$ is the radial distance, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $v$ is the radial velocity.

From the equation of state:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dr} = \\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p} \\frac{d\\rho}{dr} $$\nWe can identify the isothermal sound speed squared as:\n$$ c_s^2 = \\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p} $$\nThis provides the expression for $c_s$ as requested: $c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p}}$.\n\nUsing $c_s^2$, the pressure gradient term in the momentum equation becomes $\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{dP}{dr} = \\frac{c_s^2}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}$.

This requires the flow to pass through a sonic point, where $v=c_s$. At this point, the denominator of the wind equation, $v^2 - c_s^2$, becomes zero. For the velocity gradient $\\frac{dv}{dr}$ to be finite and non-zero (i.e., for the solution to be smooth and accelerating), the numerator must also be zero at the same location. This unique location is the critical radius, $r_c$.\n\nThe condition for the critical point is that at $r=r_c$, we have $v=c_s$ and the numerator is zero:\n$$ 2c_s^2 r_c - GM = 0 $$\nSolving for $r_c$ gives the expression for the critical radius:\n$$ r_c = \\frac{GM}{2c_s^2} $$\nThis is the condition for a smooth transonic solution.\n\nNext, we evaluate these quantities numerically for the given solar parameters.\n$T_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $M = M_{\\odot} = 1.98847 \\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\mu = 0.6$.\nConstants: $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$, $m_p = 1.6726219 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and $R_{\\odot} = 6.957 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the isothermal sound speed, $c_s^2$:\n$$ c_s^2 = \\frac{k_B T_0}{\\mu m_p} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) (1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(0.6)(1.6726219 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg})} $$\n$$ c_s^2 \\approx \\frac{2.0709735 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{1.0035731 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 2.06359 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}} $$\nThe isothermal sound speed is:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{2.06359 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}} \\approx 1.4365 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 143.7\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, calculate the critical radius $r_c$:\n$$ r_c = \\frac{GM_{\\odot}}{2c_s^2} = \\frac{(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}) (1.98847 \\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg})}{2(2.06359 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}})} $$\n$$ r_c \\approx \\frac{1.327124 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-2}}}{4.12718 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}} \\approx 3.21558 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer as the ratio $r_c/R_{\\odot}$:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{R_{\\odot}} = \\frac{3.21558 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{m}}{6.957 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 4.62218 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $4.62$.\n\nFinally, we explain why $r_c$ lies a few solar radii from the photosphere. The location of the critical point is determined by a balance between the thermal energy of the gas, which drives the expansion, and the gravitational potential energy, which resists it. The condition $r_c = GM/(2c_s^2)$ can be rearranged to compare energies. The gravitational potential energy per unit mass is $-GM/r$, and a measure of the thermal energy per unit mass is proportional to $c_s^2$. Specifically, at $r_c$, we have $\\frac{GM}{r_c} = 2c_s^2$. The magnitude of the gravitational potential energy per particle at $r_c$ is $\\frac{GM\\mu m_p}{r_c}$, which, using the expression for $c_s^2$, is equal to $2k_B T_0$. This means the critical point occurs where the gravitational binding energy per particle is comparable to (twice) its thermal energy.\n\nWe can re-express this in terms of characteristic velocities. The escape velocity from the solar surface (photosphere) at $r=R_{\\odot}$ is $v_{esc,\\odot} = \\sqrt{2GM_{\\odot}/R_{\\odot}} \\approx 618\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The thermal sound speed in the hot corona ($T_0 \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{K}$) is $c_s \\approx 144\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The ratio of these speeds is $v_{esc,\\odot}/c_s \\approx 4.3$.\nWe can write $r_c$ in terms of this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{R_{\\odot}} = \\frac{GM_{\\odot}}{2c_s^2 R_{\\odot}} = \\frac{R_{\\odot}}{R_{\\odot}} \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{2GM_{\\odot}/R_{\\odot}}{c_s^2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{v_{esc,\\odot}}{c_s}\\right)^2 $$\nSince the escape velocity from the surface is a few times larger than the coronal sound speed ($v_{esc,\\odot} \\approx 4.3 c_s$), the critical radius must be a few solar radii:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{R_{\\odot}} \\approx \\frac{1}{4}(4.3)^2 \\approx 4.6 $$\nThe high temperature of the corona makes the thermal energy a significant fraction of the gravitational binding energy, pushing the critical point for acceleration to supersonic speeds out to several solar radii, thereby enabling a powerful stellar wind. If the corona were cooler, $c_s$ would be smaller, and $r_c$ would be much larger, effectively shutting off the wind.",

The advective timescale over the same scale length is\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{adv}} = \\frac{L}{u} = \\frac{2.08839\\times 10^{11}}{2.0\\times 10^{7}} = 1.044195\\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{s}.\n$$\n\n6. The requested ratio is\n$$\n\\Pi \\equiv \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{cond}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{adv}}} = \\frac{1.781227\\times 10^{2}}{1.044195\\times 10^{4}} = 0.0170584.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures,\n$$\n\\Pi = 0.017.\n$$\n\nSanity check (not required for the final reported value): The Spitzer–Härm heat flux is $q_{\\mathrm{SH}} = -\\kappa_{\\parallel}\\,\\mathrm{d}T_{e}/\\mathrm{d}r$. Using $\\kappa_{\\parallel} = 2.535221883\\times 10^{9}$ and $\\mathrm{d}T_{e}/\\mathrm{d}r = -7.1839\\times 10^{-6}$ in consistent cgs units,\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{SH}} = \\left(2.535221883\\times 10^{9}\\right)\\times \\left(7.1839\\times 10^{-6}\\right) = 1.8213\\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1},\n$$\nwhich is consistent with $q_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1.8\\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since $\\Pi \\ll 1$, thermal conduction acts faster than advection over $L$, supporting the local isothermal approximation at $r_{0}$ in this collisional framework.",
