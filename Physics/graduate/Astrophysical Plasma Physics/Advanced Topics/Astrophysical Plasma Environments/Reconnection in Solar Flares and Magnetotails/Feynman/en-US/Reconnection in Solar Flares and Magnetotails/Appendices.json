            "solution": "The problem presents a valid and well-posed question in the domain of astrophysical plasma physics. It is scientifically grounded in resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and provides a complete set of parameters to derive and evaluate the Sweet–Parker reconnection timescale. The parameters are physically realistic for the specified environment (Earth's magnetotail). The problem is objective and free of any of the invalidating flaws listed in the instructions.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. The Sweet–Parker model considers a steady-state (${\\partial}/{\\partial t} = 0$) two-dimensional reconnection scenario. We establish a coordinate system where the magnetic field is primarily in the $x$-direction and reverses across a current sheet centered at $y=0$. The plasma flows into the sheet from the $\\pm y$ directions (inflow) and is ejected along the $\\pm x$ directions (outflow). The reconnection layer has a macroscopic half-length $L$ and a microscopic half-thickness $\\delta$.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of mass conservation. The mass flux into the rectangular reconnection volume of dimensions $2L \\times 2\\delta$ must equal the mass flux out of it. Assuming a uniform density $\\rho$, we have:\n$$ \\rho v_{in} (2L) = \\rho v_{out} (2\\delta) $$\nwhere $v_{in}$ is the inflow speed and $v_{out}$ is the outflow speed. This simplifies to:\n$$ v_{in} L = v_{out} \\delta $$\n\nSecond, the problem states to assume the outflow speed is Alfvénic, determined by the upstream magnetic field $B_0$ and plasma density $\\rho = n m_p$. The Alfvén speed $v_A$ is given by:\n$$ v_{out} = v_A = \\frac{B_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}} $$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability.\n\nThird, we use the principles of electrodynamics. In steady state, Faraday's law is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$. For a $2$D system with reconnection occurring, this implies a uniform, non-zero electric field $\\mathbf{E} = E_z \\hat{z}$ perpendicular to the reconnection plane. Outside the resistive layer, in the ideal inflow region, the ideal Ohm's law $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = 0$ holds. With inflow velocity $\\mathbf{v} \\approx \\pm v_{in} \\hat{y}$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} \\approx \\pm B_0 \\hat{x}$, the magnitude of the reconnection electric field is:\n$$ E_z = v_{in} B_0 $$\n\nInside the thin resistive layer, the full resistive Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$, must be used, where $\\eta$ is the plasma resistivity and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density. At the central stagnation point ($x=0, y=0$), both the local velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ and magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ are zero. Here, the Ohm's law simplifies to $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$. The current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is found from Ampère's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$. The dominant component is $J_z$, which arises from the sharp gradient of $B_x$ across the layer thickness $2\\delta$:\n$$ J_z = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_z \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y} \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{(-B_0) - (B_0)}{2\\delta} = \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 \\delta} $$\nEquating the electric field at the stagnation point to the global reconnection electric field gives:\n$$ v_{in} B_0 = E_z = \\eta J_z = \\eta \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 \\delta} $$\nThis yields a relationship for the inflow speed:\n$$ v_{in} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\delta} $$\n\nWe now have a system of three key equations:\n1. $v_{in} L = v_{out} \\delta$\n2. $v_{out} = v_A$\n3. $v_{in} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\delta}$\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2), we express the layer half-thickness $\\delta$ as $\\delta = L (v_{in} / v_{out}) = L (v_{in} / v_A)$. Substituting this into equation (3):\n$$ v_{in} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 (L v_{in} / v_A)} = \\frac{\\eta v_A}{\\mu_0 L v_{in}} $$\nSolving for $v_{in}$:\n$$ v_{in}^2 = \\frac{\\eta v_A}{\\mu_0 L} $$\nThe Lundquist number, $S$, is defined as $S = \\mu_0 L v_A / \\eta$. We can rewrite the expression for $v_{in}^2$ as:\n$$ v_{in}^2 = v_A^2 \\left( \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 L v_A} \\right) = \\frac{v_A^2}{S} $$\nThus, the Sweet–Parker inflow speed is:\n$$ v_{in} = \\frac{v_A}{\\sqrt{S}} $$\nThe global advection timescale, $t_{\\mathrm{SP}}$, is the characteristic time for plasma to be advected into the reconnection site from the macroscopic scale $L$. This is given by $t_{\\mathrm{SP}} = L/v_{in}$.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{SP}} = \\frac{L}{v_A / \\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{L \\sqrt{S}}{v_A} $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the timescale.\n\nNow, we evaluate this timescale numerically using the provided parameters, converted to SI units:\n- $B_0 = 20\\,\\mathrm{nT} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- $n = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 0.3 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $L = 10^5\\,\\mathrm{km} = 1.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $T_e = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $\\ln\\Lambda = 20$\n- $Z = 1$\n- $m_p = 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H\\,m^{-1}}$\n\n1.

            "introduction": "Having established that the slow, collisional Sweet-Parker model often fails to match observations, we must ask a more fundamental question: under what conditions is a purely resistive description of a plasma even valid? This exercise delves into the crucial transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection by comparing the characteristic scale length of the resistive diffusion region with the ion inertial length. By deriving the critical Lundquist number $S_c$ that marks this transition , you will establish the physical threshold where a more complex, two-fluid or kinetic description of the plasma becomes essential to capture the physics of fast reconnection.",

            "problem": "A planar, quasi-steady current sheet of half-length $L$ forms in a magnetized plasma such as the solar corona or Earth's magnetotail during magnetic reconnection. Upstream of the sheet, the magnetic field magnitude is $B$ and the ion number density is $n_i$. The plasma is sufficiently magnetized that the outflow along the sheet reaches the local Alfvén speed $V_A$. The non-ideal electric field in the layer arises either from collisional resistivity (Spitzer-type) or from collisionless two-fluid effects (for example, the Hall term and electron inertia).\n\nStarting only from Faraday's law, Ampère's law, and the collisional form of the generalized Ohm's law, construct a scaling argument for the thickness $\\delta$ of the steady-state diffusion region in resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Then, define the ion inertial length $d_i$ in terms of upstream parameters and universal constants, and impose the threshold condition that demarcates the onset of collisionless non-idealness by requiring the resistive diffusion-region thickness to equal the ion inertial length. Finally, use the conventional definition of the Lundquist number $S$ to express this threshold as a critical Lundquist number $S_c$ in closed form, in terms of $L$, $n_i$, the ion mass $m_i$, the elementary charge $e$, and the vacuum permeability $\\mu_0$.\n\nProvide your final answer as the single analytic expression for $S_c$. Do not evaluate numerically. No rounding is required. The final expression is dimensionless, so no units need to be included in the boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a critical Lundquist number, $S_c$, which signifies the threshold where the thickness of a resistive magnetic diffusion region becomes comparable to the ion inertial length. The derivation must start from Faraday's law, Ampère's law, and the collisional form of the generalized Ohm's law.\n\nFirst, we set up a scaling analysis for a quasi-steady, planar reconnection layer, a model often referred to as the Sweet-Parker model. Let the current sheet have a half-length $L$ in the $x$-direction and a half-thickness $\\delta$ in the $y$-direction. The magnetic field is primarily in the $x$-direction upstream of the sheet, with magnitude $B$, and it reverses across the sheet (i.e., $B_x(y) \\approx -B_x(-y)$). Plasma flows into the sheet along the $y$-direction with a speed $V_{in}$ and is ejected along the $x$-direction with an outflow speed $V_{out}$.\n\nThe problem states we must use three fundamental laws:\n1.  **Faraday's Law**: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$. For a system in a quasi-steady state, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} \\approx 0$, which implies $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$. In a two-dimensional ($x, y$) geometry, this means the out-of-plane component of the electric field, $E_z$, is spatially uniform. This is the reconnection electric field.\n\n2.  **Collisional Ohm's Law**: $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{V} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$, where $\\eta$ is the resistivity and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density. We evaluate this law in two distinct regions:\n    *   In the upstream inflow region, far from the central sheet (i.e., $|y| \\gg \\delta$), the plasma is highly conductive and the resistive term is negligible ($\\eta \\mathbf{J} \\approx 0$). Here, the magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B} \\approx (B, 0, 0)$ and the inflow velocity is $\\mathbf{V} \\approx (0, -V_{in}, 0)$. The ideal Ohm's law gives $\\mathbf{E} \\approx -\\mathbf{V} \\times \\mathbf{B} = - (0, -V_{in}, 0) \\times (B, 0, 0) = (0, 0, V_{in}B)$. Thus, the reconnection electric field is $E_z \\approx V_{in}B$.\n    *   At the very center of the diffusion region ($x=0, y=0$), the magnetic field passes through zero ($B=0$) by symmetry. The convective term $\\mathbf{V} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ vanishes, and Ohm's law reduces to its non-ideal form: $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$. The current is directed out of the plane, so $E_z = \\eta J_z$.\n\n    Equating the expressions for the uniform electric field $E_z$ from both regions yields a key relationship:\n    $$V_{in}B \\approx \\eta J_z$$\n\n3.  **Ampère's Law**: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$. Across the current sheet, the magnetic field $B_x$ changes by approximately $2B$ over a distance of $2\\delta$. Using a scaling analysis for the $z$-component, $(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_z = \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y}$. In the narrow sheet approximation ($L \\gg \\delta$), the term $\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y}$ dominates. Thus, we can write the scaling for the current density as:\n    $$\\mu_0 J_z \\sim \\frac{B}{\\delta} \\implies J_z \\sim \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this scaling for $J_z$ back into our result from Ohm's law:\n$$V_{in}B \\sim \\eta \\left(\\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta}\\right) \\implies V_{in} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\delta}$$\nThis provides one equation relating the inflow speed $V_{in}$ to the sheet thickness $\\delta$. To solve for $\\delta$, we require a second, independent relationship. This is provided by the principle of mass conservation. For a steady, incompressible flow, the mass flux into the reconnection region must equal the mass flux out. The area for inflow is $2L$ (the length of the sheet), and the area for outflow is $2\\delta$ (the thickness of the outflow jets).\n$$V_{in} \\cdot (2L) = V_{out} \\cdot (2\\delta)$$\n$$V_{in}L = V_{out}\\delta$$\nThe problem states that the outflow speed is the local Alfvén speed, $V_{out} = V_A$. The Alfvén speed is defined using upstream parameters as $V_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}$, where $\\rho \\approx n_i m_i$ is the mass density (ion mass $m_i$ dominates).\n$$V_{in} = V_A \\frac{\\delta}{L}$$\nWe now have two expressions for $V_{in}$. Equating them allows us to solve for $\\delta$:\n$$\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0 \\delta} \\sim V_A \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\implies \\delta^2 \\sim \\frac{\\eta L}{\\mu_0 V_A}$$\nThis gives the scaling for the thickness of the resistive diffusion region:\n$$\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta L}{\\mu_0 V_A}}$$\n\nThe next step is to define the ion inertial length, $d_i$. This is the characteristic length scale below which ion inertia becomes important. It is defined as the speed of light $c$ divided by the ion plasma frequency $\\omega_{pi}$:\n$$d_i = \\frac{c}{\\omega_{pi}}$$\nThe ion plasma frequency is $\\omega_{pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_i e^2}{\\epsilon_0 m_i}}$. Using the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0}$, we can eliminate $\\epsilon_0 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 c^2}$:\n$$d_i = c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 m_i}{n_i e^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{n_i e^2 \\mu_0 c^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2}}$$\n\nThe problem posits a threshold condition for the onset of collisionless effects, which occurs when the resistive diffusion layer thickness $\\delta$ becomes as small as the ion inertial length $d_i$. Let $\\eta_c$ be the value of resistivity at this threshold.\n$$\\delta = d_i \\implies \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta_c L}{\\mu_0 V_A}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2}}$$\nSquaring both sides and simplifying gives the condition on the critical resistivity $\\eta_c$:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_c L}{\\mu_0 V_A} = \\frac{m_i}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2} \\implies \\eta_c = \\frac{m_i V_A}{n_i e^2 L}$$\nFinally, we express this threshold in terms of the Lundquist number $S$. The Lundquist number is a dimensionless parameter representing the ratio of the resistive diffusion timescale, $\\tau_R = \\frac{\\mu_0 L^2}{\\eta}$, to the Alfvén transit time, $\\tau_A = \\frac{L}{V_A}$.\n$$S = \\frac{\\tau_R}{\\tau_A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 L^2 / \\eta}{L / V_A} = \\frac{\\mu_0 L V_A}{\\eta}$$\nThe critical Lundquist number, $S_c$, corresponds to the value of $S$ when the resistivity is $\\eta = \\eta_c$:\n$$S_c = \\frac{\\mu_0 L V_A}{\\eta_c}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\eta_c$:\n$$S_c = \\frac{\\mu_0 L V_A}{\\left(\\frac{m_i V_A}{n_i e^2 L}\\right)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 L V_A n_i e^2 L}{m_i V_A}$$\nThe Alfvén speed $V_A$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for the critical Lundquist number:\n$$S_c = \\frac{\\mu_0 n_i e^2 L^2}{m_i}$$\nThis expression depends only on the system size $L$, the upstream ion density $n_i$, and fundamental constants, as required. It can also be written as $S_c = (L/d_i)^2$, which is a standard result for the transition from slow, resistive (Sweet-Parker) reconnection to fast, collisionless (Hall) reconnection.",

Substituting this into the momentum relation gives:\n$$ \\rho_1 v_{n1} \\left(v_{n1} \\frac{B_{t1}}{B_n}\\right) = \\frac{B_n B_{t1}}{\\mu_0} \\implies \\rho_1 v_{n1}^2 = \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0} $$\nThis yields a crucial property of a switch-off shock: the upstream normal inflow speed is the normal Alfvén speed, $v_{n1} = \\frac{B_n}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho_1}} = v_{A,n1}$.\n\nNow we analyze the normal momentum conservation equation (2):\n$$ p_1 + \\rho_1 v_{n1}^2 + \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_2 + \\rho_2 v_{n2}^2 + \\frac{B_{t2}^2}{2\\mu_0} $$\nApplying the SOS condition ($B_{t2} = 0$) and substituting $\\rho_1 v_{n1}^2 = B_n^2/\\mu_0$:\n$$ p_1 + \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0} + \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_2 + \\rho_2 v_{n2}^2 $$\nFrom mass conservation, $v_{n2} = (\\rho_1/\\rho_2)v_{n1}$. Thus $\\rho_2 v_{n2}^2 = \\rho_2 (\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2})^2 v_{n1}^2 = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} (\\rho_1 v_{n1}^2) = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0}$.\nSubstituting this back gives:\n$$ p_1 + \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0} + \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_2 + \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0} $$\nRearranging for the pressure increase, $p_2 - p_1$:\n$$ p_2 - p_1 = \\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}\\right) + \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} $$\nThis equation shows that the plasma is heated (pressure increases) by two effects: compression associated with the normal magnetic field component and, more significantly, the annihilation of the tangential magnetic field.\n\nThe problem asks for an approximation under two conditions:\n1.  **Large $\\theta$ ($B_{t1} \\gg B_n$):** The magnetic field is nearly tangential to the shock. This means $B_n = B \\cos\\theta$ is small, and $B_{t1} = B \\sin\\theta$ is large. In the equation for $p_2 - p_1$, the term $\\frac{B_n^2}{\\mu_0}(1 - \\rho_1/\\rho_2)$ is of order $\\cos^2\\theta$, while the term $\\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0}$ is of order $\\sin^2\\theta$. For large $\\theta$, we can neglect the $B_n^2$ term as a leading-order approximation.\n2.  **Low-$\\beta$ limit:** This assumption, $\\beta_1 = p_1 / (B_1^2 / (2\\mu_0)) \\ll 1$, primarily ensures that the magnetic field dynamics dominate the plasma thermodynamics upstream.\n\nApplying the large-$\\theta$ approximation, we obtain the key result for the pressure jump:\n$$ p_2 - p_1 \\approx \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} $$\nThis explicitly demonstrates that the thermal pressure increase is driven by the dissipation of the upstream tangential magnetic pressure.\nUsing the ideal gas law, $p = n k_B T$, the pressure jump is:\n$$ n_2 k_B T_2 - n_1 k_B T_1 \\approx \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} $$\nThe problem further instructs to assume that \"the density compression is subleading\". This is an instruction to approximate $n_2 \\approx n_1$. Applying this approximation:\n$$ n_1 k_B T_2 - n_1 k_B T_1 \\approx \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} \\implies n_1 k_B (T_2 - T_1) \\approx \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2\\mu_0} $$\nSolving for the temperature increase $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$:\n$$ \\Delta T \\approx \\frac{B_{t1}^2}{2 \\mu_0 n_1 k_B} $$\nSubstituting $B_{t1} = B \\sin\\theta$, we arrive at the final analytical expression:\n$$ \\Delta T \\approx \\frac{(B \\sin\\theta)^2}{2 \\mu_0 n_1 k_B} $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the provided parameters:\n-   $n_1 = 2.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $T_1 = 1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n-   $B = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n-   $\\theta = 80^{\\circ}$\n-   $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}$\n-   $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nFirst, we compute the numerator, $(B \\sin\\theta)^2$:\n$$ (B \\sin\\theta)^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times \\sin(80^{\\circ}))^2 \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.98480775)^2 \\approx 0.9698463 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{T}^2 $$\nNext, we compute the denominator, $2 \\mu_0 n_1 k_B$:\n$$ 2 \\mu_0 n_1 k_B = 2 \\times (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{15}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) $$\n$$ = (16\\pi \\times 1.380649) \\times 10^{-15} \\approx 6.93965 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{J/(m^3 K)} $$\nNow we calculate the ratio for $\\Delta T$:\n$$ \\Delta T \\approx \\frac{0.9698463 \\times 10^{-6}}{6.93965 \\times 10^{-14}} \\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 0.139755 \\times 10^8 \\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 13.9755 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThe temperature increase is approximately $13.9755$ mega-Kelvin (MK).
