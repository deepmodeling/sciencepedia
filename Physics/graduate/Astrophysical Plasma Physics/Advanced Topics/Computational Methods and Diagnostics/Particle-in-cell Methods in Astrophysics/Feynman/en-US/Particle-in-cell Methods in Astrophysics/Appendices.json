It is a standard derivation problem in the specified field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) scheme, also known as the first-order scheme ($p=1$), uses a shape function $S_1(y)$ which can be derived from the convolution of the Nearest-Grid-Point (NGP) or zeroth-order shape function, $S_0(y)$, with itself. The NGP shape function is a rectangular or \"top-hat\" function centered at the origin:\n$$\nS_0(y) = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if } |y| \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |y| > \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe convolution to obtain the unnormalized CIC shape function, which we denote $S_{1,u}(y)$, is given by:\n$$\nS_{1,u}(y) = (S_0 * S_0)(y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} S_0(z) S_0(y-z) dz\n$$\nThe integrand is non-zero only when both $S_0(z)$ and $S_0(y-z)$ are non-zero. This requires $|z| \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$ and $|y-z| \\le \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$. The second condition is equivalent to $y - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\le z \\le y + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$. Therefore, the integral is non-zero only for $z$ in the intersection of the intervals $[-\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}, \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}]$ and $[y - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}, y + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}]$. The integral's value is the length of this intersection region.\n\nWe analyze the overlap for different ranges of $y$:\n1.  For $|y| \\ge \\Delta x$, there is no overlap between the two intervals. Thus, $S_{1,u}(y) = 0$.\n2.  For $0 \\le y < \\Delta x$, the intersection interval for $z$ is $[y - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}, \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}]$. The length of this interval is $\\frac{\\Delta x}{2} - (y - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}) = \\Delta x - y$. So, $S_{1,u}(y) = \\Delta x - y$.\n3.  For $-\\Delta x < y < 0$, the intersection interval for $z$ is $[-\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}, y + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}]$. The length of this interval is $(y + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}) - (-\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}) = y + \\Delta x$. So, $S_{1,u}(y) = y + \\Delta x$.\n\nCombining these results, we can write the unnormalized CIC shape function as a single expression:\n$$\nS_{1,u}(y) = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\Delta x - |y| & \\text{if } |y| \\le \\Delta x \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |y| > \\Delta x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is a triangular function with support over $[- \\Delta x, \\Delta x]$, a base of width $2\\Delta x$, and a peak value of $\\Delta x$ at $y=0$.\n\nFor charge-conserving deposition schemes, the shape function must satisfy the partition of unity property, meaning the sum of its values at a particle's position, evaluated relative to all interacting grid points, must equal $1$. A particle at position $x_p = x_i + x$ with $x \\in [0, \\Delta x]$ interacts only with grid points $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$. The sum of the unnormalized shape functions is:\n$$\nS_{1,u}(x_p - x_i) + S_{1,u}(x_p - x_{i+1}) = S_{1,u}(x) + S_{1,u}(x - \\Delta x)\n$$\nUsing our derived expression for $S_{1,u}(y)$:\n- Since $x \\in [0, \\Delta x]$, we have $S_{1,u}(x) = \\Delta x - x$.\n- Since $x - \\Delta x \\in [-\\Delta x, 0]$, we have $S_{1,u}(x - \\Delta x) = (x - \\Delta x) + \\Delta x = x$.\nThe sum is $(\\Delta x - x) + x = \\Delta x$. To satisfy the partition of unity, we must normalize the shape function by dividing by this sum, $\\Delta x$. The normalized CIC shape function, let's call it $W(y)$, is:\n$$\nW(y) = \\frac{S_{1,u}(y)}{\\Delta x} = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 - \\frac{|y|}{\\Delta x} & \\text{if } |y| \\le \\Delta x \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } |y| > \\Delta x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe weights $w_L$ and $w_R$ are the values of this normalized shape function evaluated at the particle's position relative to the left and right grid centers, respectively.\n\nThe particle is at an absolute position $x_p = x_i + x$, where $x \\in [0, \\Delta x]$ is the local coordinate relative to the left grid center $x_i$.\nThe weight assigned to the left grid center $x_i$ is $w_L$:\n$$\nw_L = W(x_p - x_i) = W(x)\n$$\nSince $x \\ge 0$, $|x| = x$. Therefore,\n$$\nw_L = 1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe weight assigned to the right grid center $x_{i+1} = x_i + \\Delta x$ is $w_R$:\n$$\nw_R = W(x_p - x_{i+1}) = W(x - \\Delta x)\n$$\nSince $x \\in [0, \\Delta x]$, the argument $y = x - \\Delta x$ is in the range $[-\\Delta x, 0]$. Thus, $|y| = |x - \\Delta x| = -(x - \\Delta x) = \\Delta x - x$. Therefore,\n$$\nw_R = 1 - \\frac{|x-\\Delta x|}{\\Delta x} = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta x - x}{\\Delta x} = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\\right) = \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nWe can verify the charge conservation constraint: $w_L + w_R = (1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}) + \\frac{x}{\\Delta x} = 1$. This is consistent.\n\nThe deposited charges $Q_L$ and $Q_R$ at the left and right cell centers are the particle's charge $q$ multiplied by the respective weights:\nThe charge deposited at the left center $x_i$ is:\n$$\nQ_L = q \\cdot w_L = q \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\\right)\n$$\nThe charge deposited at the right center $x_{i+1}$ is:\n$$\nQ_R = q \\cdot w_R = q \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe final answer requires these four quantities—$w_L$, $w_R$, $Q_L$, $Q_R$—in a single row matrix.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum number of particles per cell, $N_p$, needed to keep the fractional root-mean-square (RMS) error of the charge deposited on a grid node below a certain threshold $\\epsilon$. The derivation must be based on first principles of the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method, specifically the cloud-in-cell (CIC) charge deposition scheme, and statistical analysis using the central limit theorem context.\n\nLet the one-dimensional grid have nodes at positions $x_j = j \\Delta x$, where $j$ is an integer and $\\Delta x$ is the uniform grid spacing. We focus on a single grid node, which we can place at the origin $x_j=0$ without loss of generality. This node is at the interface between two adjacent cells: Cell L covering the interval $[-\\Delta x, 0]$ and Cell R covering $[0, \\Delta x]$. Each cell contains $N_p$ macro-particles. Thus, a total of $2N_p$ particles from these two cells can contribute charge to the node at $x_j=0$.\n\nThe charge deposition uses the first-order B-spline, or cloud-in-cell (CIC), shape function $S(u)$. For a particle at position $x_p$ and a grid node at $x_j$, the fraction of the particle's charge assigned to the node is given by $S(x_p - x_j)$. The function $S(u)$ is a triangular function defined as:\n$$\nS(u) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    1 - \\frac{|u|}{\\Delta x} & \\text{if } |u| \\leq \\Delta x \\\\\n    0 & \\text{if } |u| > \\Delta x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe charge deposited at node $x_j$ by a single particle $k$ with charge $q_p$ at position $x_k$ is $Q_k = q_p S(x_k - x_j)$.\n\nThe problem states that the instantaneous particle positions are independent and uniformly distributed within their respective cells. Let's analyze the charge contribution from a single particle to the node at $x_j=0$.\n\nConsider a particle in Cell R, with position $x$ being a random variable uniformly distributed in $[0, \\Delta x]$. The probability density function is $p(x) = 1/\\Delta x$ for $x \\in [0, \\Delta x]$. The charge this particle contributes to the node at $x_j=0$ is a random variable $Q_{part}$:\n$$\nQ_{part}(x) = q_p S(x - 0) = q_p S(x) = q_p \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\\right)\n$$\nWe calculate the mean (expected value) $E[Q_{part}]$ of this contribution:\n$$\n\\mu_{part} = E[Q_{part}] = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta x} Q_{part}(x) p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta x} q_p \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} dx\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{part} = \\frac{q_p}{\\Delta x} \\left[ x - \\frac{x^2}{2\\Delta x} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta x} = \\frac{q_p}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\Delta x - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2\\Delta x} \\right) = \\frac{q_p}{2}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the variance $\\text{Var}(Q_{part}) = E[Q_{part}^2] - (E[Q_{part}])^2$. First, we find the mean of the square of the contribution:\n$$\nE[Q_{part}^2] = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta x} [Q_{part}(x)]^2 p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta x} q_p^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} dx\n$$\n$$\nE[Q_{part}^2] = \\frac{q_p^2}{\\Delta x} \\int_{0}^{\\Delta x} \\left(1 - \\frac{2x}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{x^2}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\right) dx = \\frac{q_p^2}{\\Delta x} \\left[ x - \\frac{x^2}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{x^3}{3(\\Delta x)^2} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\nE[Q_{part}^2] = \\frac{q_p^2}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\Delta x - \\Delta x + \\frac{\\Delta x}{3} \\right) = \\frac{q_p^2}{3}\n$$\nThe variance for a single particle's contribution is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{part}^2 = \\text{Var}(Q_{part}) = E[Q_{part}^2] - \\mu_{part}^2 = \\frac{q_p^2}{3} - \\left(\\frac{q_p}{2}\\right)^2 = q_p^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{q_p^2}{12}\n$$\nA particle in Cell L has a position $x$ uniformly distributed in $[-\\Delta x, 0]$. Its contribution to the node at $x_j=0$ is $Q_{part}(x) = q_p S(x) = q_p(1 - |x|/\\Delta x) = q_p(1 + x/\\Delta x)$. By symmetry, the calculation for the mean and variance yields the same results: $\\mu_{part} = q_p/2$ and $\\sigma_{part}^2 = q_p^2/12$.\n\nThe total charge on the node, $Q_{node}$, is the sum of the contributions from the $2N_p$ independent particles in the two adjacent cells. The central limit theorem concerns the distribution of such a sum. A key foundation of the theorem is how the mean and variance of the sum relate to the properties of the individual random variables.\nThe mean of the sum is the sum of the means:\n$$\n\\mu_{node} = E[Q_{node}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{2N_p} E[Q_{part, k}] = 2N_p \\cdot \\mu_{part} = 2N_p \\left(\\frac{q_p}{2}\\right) = N_p q_p\n$$\nSince the particle positions are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\sigma_{node}^2 = \\text{Var}(Q_{node}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2N_p} \\text{Var}(Q_{part, k}) = 2N_p \\cdot \\sigma_{part}^2 = 2N_p \\left(\\frac{q_p^2}{12}\\right) = \\frac{N_p q_p^2}{6}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the charge on the node is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_{node} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_p q_p^2}{6}} = q_p \\sqrt{\\frac{N_p}{6}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the fractional root-mean-square error as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, $\\sigma_{node}/\\mu_{node}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{node}}{\\mu_{node}} = \\frac{q_p \\sqrt{\\frac{N_p}{6}}}{N_p q_p} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_p}\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6N_p}}\n$$\nThis fractional error is due to the discrete particle noise.

For a plane wave of the form $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{F}_0 \\exp(i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t))$, the centered finite-difference operators correspond to the following substitutions in the Fourier domain:\nThe time derivative (leapfrog scheme) is replaced by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow -\\frac{2i}{\\Delta t} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) $$\nThe spatial derivatives are replaced by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\rightarrow \\frac{2i}{\\Delta x_j} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_j \\Delta x_j}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } j \\in \\{x, y, z\\} $$\nApplying these transformations to Maxwell's equations in Fourier space ($i\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega \\mathbf{B}$ and $i\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{B} = -i\\frac{\\omega}{c^2} \\mathbf{E}$) yields the discrete-analogue equations:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\tilde{\\omega} \\mathbf{B} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{c^2} \\mathbf{E} $$\nwhere we have defined the numerical wavevector $\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}$ and numerical frequency $\\tilde{\\omega}$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\equiv \\left( \\frac{2}{\\Delta x} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}\\right), \\frac{2}{\\Delta y} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_y \\Delta y}{2}\\right), \\frac{2}{\\Delta z} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_z \\Delta z}{2}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\omega} \\equiv \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) $$\nCombining the two discrete-analogue equations, we get:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\times (\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\mathbf{E}) = -\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{c^2} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{c^2} (\\tilde{\\omega} \\mathbf{E}) $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - |\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}^2}{c^2} \\mathbf{E} $$\nFor a transverse electromagnetic wave, we have $\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$, which leads to the numerical dispersion relation:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}|^2 = \\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}^2}{c^2} $$\nSubstituting the definitions of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $\\tilde{\\omega}$, we obtain the general discrete dispersion relation for the Yee scheme:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{2}{c\\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\Delta y}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_y \\Delta y}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\Delta z}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_z \\Delta z}{2}\\right) $$\nCanceling the common factor of $4$, we arrive at the standard form:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(c \\Delta t)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\Delta y^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_y \\Delta y}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\Delta z^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_z \\Delta z}{2}\\right) $$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Numerical Phase Velocity\n\nWe now apply the specific parameters given in the problem statement.\nThe grid is uniform: $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = \\Delta z = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\nThe wave propagates along the $x$-axis: $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, 0, 0)$, so $k_y = k_z = 0$.\nThe dispersion relation simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(c \\Delta t)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\nTaking the positive square root of both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{c \\Delta t} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\nThe problem specifies the time step via the relation $c \\Delta t = 0.9\\,\\Delta x/\\sqrt{3}$. This implies a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number of $S \\equiv c \\Delta t \\sqrt{3}/\\Delta x = 0.9$. From this, we have the ratio $\\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe are also given the wave number $k_x = 0.8\\,\\pi/\\Delta x$.\nSubstituting these into the simplified dispersion relation:\n$$ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega \\Delta t}{2}\\right) = \\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_x \\Delta x}{2}\\right) = \\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(0.8\\,\\pi/\\Delta x) \\Delta x}{2}\\right) = \\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin\\left(0.4\\,\\pi\\right) $$\nWe can solve for $\\omega$:\n$$ \\omega = \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin(0.4\\,\\pi)\\right) $$\nThe numerical phase velocity is defined as $v_{\\phi} = \\omega / |\\mathbf{k}| = \\omega/k_x$.\n$$ v_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{k_x} \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin(0.4\\,\\pi)\\right) $$\nTo evaluate this, let's express it in terms of the speed of light $c$:\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\phi}}{c} = \\frac{1}{c k_x \\Delta t} \\cdot 2 \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin(0.4\\,\\pi)\\right) $$\nUsing $k_x = \\frac{0.8\\pi}{\\Delta x}$ and $\\Delta t = \\frac{0.9\\Delta x}{c\\sqrt{3}}$, we have $c k_x \\Delta t = \\frac{0.8\\pi}{\\Delta x} \\frac{0.9\\Delta x}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{0.72\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\phi}}{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{0.72\\pi} \\cdot 2 \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin(0.4\\,\\pi)\\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{0.72\\pi} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sin(0.4\\,\\pi)\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\sin(0.4\\,\\pi) \\approx 0.9510565$\n$\\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.5196152$\nArgument of $\\arcsin$: $(0.5196152) \\times (0.9510565) \\approx 0.494178$\n$\\arcsin(0.494178) \\approx 0.516876$ radians.\nThe pre-factor is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{0.72\\pi} \\approx \\frac{3.46410}{2.26195} \\approx 1.53146$.\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\phi}}{c} \\approx 1.53146 \\times 0.516876 \\approx 0.7916215 $$\nUsing the value $c = 299792458\\,\\text{m s}^{-1}$, the numerical phase velocity is:\n$$ v_{\\phi} = 0.7916215 \\times 299792458\\,\\text{m s}^{-1} \\approx 237330364\\,\\text{m s}^{-1} $$\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of the NCI Risk Parameter $\\chi$\n\nThe NCI risk parameter is defined as $\\chi \\equiv v_b / v_{\\phi}$. First, we calculate the beam speed $v_b$ for a relativistic electron with Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 20$.\n$$ v_b = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{20^2}} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{400}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}} $$\nThe ratio of the beam speed to the speed of light is:\n$$ \\frac{v_b}{c} = \\sqrt{0.9975} \\approx 0.9987492 $$\nThe beam speed in meters per second is:\n$$ v_b = 0.9987492 \\times 299792458\\,\\text{m s}^{-1} \\approx 299417937\\,\\text{m s}^{-1} $$\nNow we can compute the parameter $\\chi$:\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{v_b}{v_{\\phi}} = \\frac{v_b/c}{v_{\\phi}/c} \\approx \\frac{0.9987492}{0.7916215} \\approx 1.2616499 $$\nThe condition $\\chi > 1$ indicates that the particle beam travels faster than the phase velocity of the numerical wave mode, which is the necessary condition for Numerical Cherenkov Instability.\nRounding the value of $\\chi$ to four significant figures gives $1.262$.",
