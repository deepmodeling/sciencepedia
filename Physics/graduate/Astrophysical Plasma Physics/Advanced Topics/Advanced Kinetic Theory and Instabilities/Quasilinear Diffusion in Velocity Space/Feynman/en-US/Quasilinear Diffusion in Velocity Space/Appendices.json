All quantities are dimensionless, so no physical units are required.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Test case $1$ (mass conservation under constant diffusion):\n  - Domain endpoints: $v_{\\min} = -\\,4$, $v_{\\max} = 4$.\n  - Grid: $N = 201$ uniformly spaced points, so $\\Delta v = (v_{\\max} - v_{\\min})/(N-1)$.\n  - Initial condition: $f_0(v) = \\exp(-\\,v^2)$.\n  - Diffusion coefficient: $D(v) = D_0$ with $D_0 = 0.1$.\n  - Time step: $\\Delta t = 0.5 \\,\\Delta v^2 / D_0$.\n  - Number of time steps: $n_{\\text{steps}} = 250$.\n  - Boundary conditions: zero flux at $v_{\\min}$ and $v_{\\max}$.\n  - Output for this test: the relative mass deviation after evolution,\n    $$\n    R_1 \\;=\\; \\frac{M_{\\text{final}} - M_{\\text{initial}}}{M_{\\text{initial}}},\n    \\quad \\text{where} \\quad\n    M = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f_i \\,\\Delta v.\n    $$\n- Test case $2$ (zero-flux boundary enforcement under velocity-dependent diffusion):\n  - Domain endpoints: $v_{\\min} = -\\,4$, $v_{\\max} = 4$.\n  - Grid: $N = 201$ uniformly spaced points.\n  - Initial condition: $f_0(v) = \\exp\\!\\big(-\\,(v-1)^2\\big)$.\n  - Diffusion coefficient: $D(v) = \\dfrac{D_0}{1+v^2}$ with $D_0 = 0.2$.\n  - Time step: $\\Delta t = 0.45 \\,\\Delta v^2 / \\max_v D(v)$.\n  - Number of time steps: $n_{\\text{steps}} = 1$.\n  - Boundary conditions: zero flux at $v_{\\min}$ and $v_{\\max}$.\n  - Output for this test: the mean absolute value of the boundary fluxes computed by the scheme at the two domain boundaries in the performed step,\n    $$\n    R_2 \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Big( \\big|F_{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\big| \\;+\\; \\big|F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}}\\big| \\Big),\n    $$\n    where $F_{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $F_{N-\\frac{1}{2}}$ denote the left and right boundary fluxes respectively.

            "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a numerical scheme to solve the one-dimensional quasilinear diffusion equation, which models wave-particle interactions in a collisionless astrophysical plasma. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information to construct a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the distribution function $f(v,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f(v,t)}{\\partial t} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} \\left[ D(v) \\,\\frac{\\partial f(v,t)}{\\partial v} \\right]\n$$\nThis equation is defined on a one-dimensional velocity domain $v \\in [v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}]$. The boundary conditions are of the zero-flux (Neumann) type, meaning that no particles escape the domain:\n$$\nF(v) \\equiv -\\,D(v)\\,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\bigg|_{v=v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}} \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation numerically, we will implement the specified finite-volume method.\n\n**1. Discretization**\n\nThe continuous velocity domain $[v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}]$ is discretized into $N$ points, $v_i$, with uniform spacing $\\Delta v$. These points are treated as the centers of $N$ control volumes (or cells). The grid points are given by:\n$$\nv_i \\;=\\; v_{\\min} \\,+\\, i\\,\\Delta v, \\qquad \\text{for } i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1\n$$\nwhere the grid spacing is $\\Delta v = (v_{\\max} - v_{\\min}) / (N-1)$. The cell $C_i$ associated with the point $v_i$ is the interval $[v_i - \\Delta v/2, v_i + \\Delta v/2]$. The discrete value $f_i^n$ represents the cell-averaged value of the distribution function in cell $C_i$ at time $t^n = n\\,\\Delta t$.\n\nThe finite-volume method is derived by integrating the PDE over a control volume $C_i$:\n$$\n\\int_{v_i - \\Delta v/2}^{v_i + \\Delta v/2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\, dv \\;=\\; \\int_{v_i - \\Delta v/2}^{v_i + \\Delta v/2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v} \\left[ D(v) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\right] \\, dv\n$$\nApproximating the time derivative and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to the right-hand side yields:\n$$\n\\Delta v \\frac{f_i^{n+1} - f_i^n}{\\Delta t} \\;\\approx\\; \\left[ -D \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\right]_{v_i + \\Delta v/2} - \\left[ -D \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\right]_{v_i - \\Delta v/2}\n$$\nThe terms on the right are the diffusive fluxes $F$ at the cell interfaces. Let $F_{i+1/2}^n$ denote the flux at the interface between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$, located at $v = v_i + \\Delta v/2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{f_i^{n+1} - f_i^n}{\\Delta t} \\;=\\; \\frac{F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n}{\\Delta v}\n$$\nRearranging gives the explicit time-update formula specified in the problem:\n$$\nf_i^{n+1} \\;=\\; f_i^n \\,-\\, \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta v} \\left( F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n \\right)\n$$\nThis update rule holds for the interior cells, i.e., for $i = 1, \\dots, N-2$. Special care is required for the boundary cells $i=0$ and $i=N-1$.\n\n**2. Flux Calculation and Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe problem specifies how to approximate the fluxes at the interfaces. The flux $F_{i+1/2}^n$ is computed using a centered difference for the gradient and an arithmetic average for the diffusion coefficient:\n$$\nF_{i+1/2}^n \\;=\\; -D_{i+1/2} \\frac{f_{i+1}^n - f_i^n}{\\Delta v}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad D_{i+1/2} = \\frac{D(v_i) + D(v_{i+1})}{2} = \\frac{D_i + D_{i+1}}{2}\n$$\nThis formula applies to the internal interfaces for $i = 0, \\dots, N-2$.\n\nThe zero-flux boundary conditions are imposed at the edges of the full numerical domain, which are at $v_0 - \\Delta v/2$ and $v_{N-1} + \\Delta v/2$. These correspond to the locations of the fluxes $F_{-1/2}$ and $F_{N-1/2}$. The condition is enforced by setting these boundary fluxes to zero for all time steps $n$:\n$$\nF_{-1/2}^n \\;=\\; 0, \\qquad F_{N-1/2}^n \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nWith these boundary fluxes, the update rules for the first and last cells become:\n- For $i=0$: $f_0^{n+1} = f_0^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta v} \\left( F_{1/2}^n - F_{-1/2}^n \\right) = f_0^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta v} F_{1/2}^n$\n- For $i=N-1$: $f_{N-1}^{n+1} = f_{N-1}^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta v} \\left( F_{N-1/2}^n - F_{N-3/2}^n \\right) = f_{N-1}^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta v} F_{N-3/2}^n$\n\n**3. Time Step and Stability**\n\nThe explicit scheme is conditionally stable. The problem provides a sufficient condition for stability and positivity:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\;\\le\\; \\frac{\\Delta v^2}{2 \\max_{v \\in [v_{\\min},v_{\\max}]} D(v)}\n$$\nEach test case specifies a time step $\\Delta t$ that adheres to this criterion.\n\n**4. Implementation of Test Cases**\n\nThe numerical scheme is implemented in a Python function that executes the time-stepping loop. This function is then called for each of the three test cases with the specified parameters.\n\n- **Test Case 1 (Mass Conservation):** The total mass is defined as $M = \\int f(v,t) dv$, approximated numerically by the sum $M \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f_i \\Delta v$. A conservative numerical scheme should preserve this quantity to within machine precision. The relative mass deviation $R_1 = (M_{\\text{final}} - M_{\\text{initial}}) / M_{\\text{initial}}$ is calculated after $n_{\\text{steps}} = 250$.\n\n- **Test Case 2 (Boundary Flux Enforcement):** The scheme imposes zero flux at the boundaries by setting $F_{-1/2}$ and $F_{N-1/2}$ to $0$ directly. The output $R_2$ is the mean absolute value of these imposed fluxes: $R_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lvert F_{-1/2} \\rvert + \\lvert F_{N-1/2} \\rvert)$. By design, this value is exactly $0$.\n\n- **Test Case 3 (Positivity):** The distribution function $f(v,t)$ is a probability density and must remain non-negative. The chosen time step respects the stability condition, which is also sufficient to ensure positivity. The simulation is run for $n_{\\text{steps}} = 300$, and the final distribution $f_i^{n_{\\text{steps}}}$ is checked for non-negativity at all grid points. The boolean result $R_3$ will be `True` if all $f_i \\ge 0$. A small floating-point tolerance is used in the check to account for potential round-off errors.",
