A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the equilibrium condition for a one-dimensional current sheet. We begin with the fundamental equation for force balance in a plasma in static equilibrium. The steady-state momentum equation for a fluid, neglecting gravity, viscosity, and inertial terms ($\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$), is:\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nHere, $p$ is the scalar thermal pressure, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional system where all quantities vary only with the coordinate $x$. The pressure is $p(x)$, and the magnetic field is given as $\\mathbf{B} = B_{y}(x)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The pressure gradient is therefore:\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\frac{dp}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\n\nThe current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is related to the magnetic field by Ampère's law. In a steady state, this is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$. For the given magnetic field configuration, we compute the curl:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times (B_{y}(x)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} - \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nSince the system is one-dimensional with variation only in $x$, the term $\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z}$ is zero. Thus, the current density is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} ( \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} ) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe current flows in the $z$-direction, perpendicular to both the direction of spatial variation ($x$) and the reconnecting magnetic field ($y$).\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $\\nabla p$, $\\mathbf{J}$, and $\\mathbf{B}$ back into the force balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\right) \\times ( B_y(x) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} )\n$$\nThe cross product on the right-hand side is evaluated as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nEquating the components along $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, we obtain the scalar differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} = - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx}\n$$\nThe term on the right-hand side can be expressed as the derivative of the magnetic pressure, $p_B = \\frac{B_y^2}{2\\mu_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{B_y^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\left( 2 B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_y \\frac{dB_y}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our force balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} = - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( p(x) + \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is the first required result: the constraint relating the thermal pressure and magnetic field profiles. Integrating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that the sum of the thermal pressure and the magnetic pressure is constant across the current sheet:\n$$\np(x) + \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThis represents the principle of total pressure balance in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nTo find the value of this constant, we use the given conditions in the upstream region (far from the sheet, at large $|x|$). There, the pressure is $p_{\\mathrm{up}}$ and the magnetic field magnitude is $B_{\\mathrm{up}}$. So, the constant is:\n$$\n\\text{constant} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nTherefore, the pressure balance equation holds for all $x$:\n$$\np(x) + \\frac{B_y(x)^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the required thermal pressure $p(0)$ at the midplane ($x=0$). We are given that the reconnecting magnetic field component vanishes at the midplane: $B_y(0)=0$. Applying the pressure balance equation at $x=0$:\n$$\np(0) + \\frac{B_y(0)^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\n$$\np(0) + \\frac{0^2}{2\\mu_0} = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the midplane thermal pressure:\n$$\np(0) = p_{\\mathrm{up}} + \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the magnetic pressure in the upstream region is converted into thermal pressure at the center of the current sheet to maintain equilibrium. This is consistent with a Harris sheet equilibrium, where a peak in plasma density (and thus thermal pressure, assuming constant temperature) exists at the sheet's center to balance the external magnetic field pressure.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values to calculate $p(0)$.\nGiven:\n$B_{\\mathrm{up}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n$p_{\\mathrm{up}} = 1.38\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{H/m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the upstream magnetic pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{up}}^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7})} = \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{8\\pi \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{90}{8\\pi} = \\frac{45}{4\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nNow, we add the upstream thermal pressure:\n$$\np(0) = 1.38 + \\frac{45}{4\\pi}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\np(0) \\approx 1.38 + \\frac{45}{4 \\times 3.14159265...} \\approx 1.38 + 3.581056...\n$$\n$$\np(0) \\approx 4.961056...\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\np(0) \\approx 4.961\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$",

The upstream reconnecting magnetic field has magnitude $B_0$, the upstream number density is $n_0$, and the current sheet has a characteristic half-thickness $\\delta$. Assume a quasi-steady, two-dimensional ($2$-D) geometry with ignorable $z$-direction, and neglect the displacement current.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an estimate of the peak amplitude of the out-of-plane quadrupolar magnetic field, $B_z$, in a collisionless, anti-parallel magnetic reconnection layer, expressed in terms of the upstream magnetic field magnitude, $B_0$. The derivation will be performed using scaling analysis based on first principles, as guided by the problem statement. All mathematical entities will be written in LaTeX as required.\n\nThe problem is set in a $2$-D geometry, which we take to be the $x-y$ plane, with the $z$-direction being ignorable ($\\partial/\\partial z = 0$). The reconnecting magnetic field, $B_x$, is anti-parallel and reverses its sign across the current sheet centered at $y=0$. The half-thickness of this sheet is $\\delta$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Express $B_z$ in terms of $\\delta$ and $U_H$**\n\nThe out-of-plane magnetic field component, $B_z$, is generated by in-plane electric currents, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\perp} = J_x \\hat{x} + J_y \\hat{y}$. The relationship between the magnetic field and the current density is given by Ampère's law. Neglecting the displacement current, as stated in the problem, we have:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} $$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.\n\nThe components of the curl in our $2$-D system give the sources for the in-plane currents:\n$$ (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_x = \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z} = \\mu_0 J_x $$\n$$ (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_y = \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x} = \\mu_0 J_y $$\nGiven that the geometry is $2$-D with an ignorable $z$-direction, all derivatives with respect to $z$ are zero ($\\partial/\\partial z = 0$). The equations simplify to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y} = \\mu_0 J_x $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x} = \\mu_0 J_y $$\nWe can estimate the magnitude of these terms using a scaling analysis. The characteristic length scale over which the fields and currents vary within the diffusion region is the current sheet half-thickness, $\\delta$. Let $B_z$ denote the characteristic peak amplitude of the out-of-plane field and $J$ denote the characteristic magnitude of the in-plane Hall current, i.e., $J \\sim |\\mathbf{J}_{\\perp}|$. The derivatives can be approximated by ratios of the characteristic quantities:\n$$ \\frac{B_z}{\\delta} \\sim \\mu_0 J $$\nThis scaling relation provides an estimate for the peak out-of-plane magnetic field in terms of the in-plane current magnitude and the sheet thickness:\n$$ B_z \\sim \\mu_0 J \\delta $$\nThe problem then asks to express this in terms of the electron-ion drift speed, defined as $U_H \\equiv J / (n_0 e)$, where $n_0$ is the upstream number density and $e$ is the elementary charge. Substituting $J = n_0 e U_H$ into our expression for $B_z$, we get:\n$$ B_z \\sim \\mu_0 \\delta n_0 e U_H $$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate $J$ in favor of upstream parameters**\n\nThe second part of the task is to relate $J$ to the upstream reconnecting magnetic field, $B_0$. This is achieved by considering the primary current that supports the reversal of the magnetic field $B_x$. This current flows in the out-of-plane direction, $J_z$.\n\nFrom the $z$-component of Ampère's law:\n$$ (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_z = \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y} = \\mu_0 J_z $$\nIn a thin current sheet geometry, the gradient of the reversing field component is much larger than other terms, so $|\\partial B_x / \\partial y| \\gg |\\partial B_y / \\partial x|$. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\mu_0 J_z \\approx -\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y} $$\nThe problem instructs us to estimate this by considering the total change in $B_x$ across the full thickness of the sheet, $2\\delta$. The field $B_x$ changes from approximately $-B_0$ to $+B_0$ over this distance. We can estimate the magnitude of the derivative as:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y} \\right| \\sim \\frac{|B_0 - (-B_0)|}{2\\delta} = \\frac{2B_0}{2\\delta} = \\frac{B_0}{\\delta} $$\nSubstituting this into the scaled Ampère's law gives the characteristic magnitude of the out-of-plane current density, $J_z$:\n$$ \\mu_0 J_z \\sim \\frac{B_0}{\\delta} \\implies J_z \\sim \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 \\delta} $$\nNow, a crucial step is to relate the magnitude of the in-plane Hall current, $J$, to the out-of-plane current, $J_z$. The problem states that we are in the Hall regime, where the in-plane current is primarily carried by electrons. In this regime, the same population of electrons flowing within the thin current sheet is responsible for all components of the current density $\\mathbf{J}$. The Hall effect, described by the $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ term in the generalized Ohm's law, couples the different current components. A standard approximation, consistent with more detailed analysis and simulations, is that the characteristic magnitudes of the in-plane and out-of-plane current densities are of the same order. Thus, we introduce the key approximation:\n$$ J \\sim J_z $$\nUsing this, we can now estimate the magnitude of the in-plane current $J$ in terms of the upstream field $B_0$:\n$$ J \\sim \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 \\delta} $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $J$ back into our result from Step 1, $B_z \\sim \\mu_0 J \\delta$:\n$$ B_z \\sim \\mu_0 \\left( \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 \\delta} \\right) \\delta $$\nThe terms $\\mu_0$ and $\\delta$ cancel, yielding the final estimate for the peak amplitude of the quadrupolar Hall magnetic field:\n$$ B_z \\sim B_0 $$\nThis fundamental result indicates that the self-generated out-of-plane magnetic field in Hall reconnection has a peak amplitude comparable to the magnitude of the initial reconnecting magnetic field. The problem asks for the final expression in terms of $B_0$ only, omitting numerical coefficients of order unity, which is precisely what this scaling relation represents.",

The mass density is $\\rho = n_{i} m_{i}$.\nFirst, convert the ion number density $n_i$ to SI units (m$^{-3}$):\n$$ n_{i} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 0.2 \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{-3} = 0.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} $$\nThe mass density $\\rho$ is calculated using the proton mass $m_p \\approx 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$ \\rho = n_{i} m_{p} = (0.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}})(1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 0.33452 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}} $$\nThe upstream magnetic field is $B_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nT} = 20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}$, and the permeability of free space is $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A}$.\nNow we can compute $V_A$:\n$$ V_{A} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}}{\\sqrt{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A})(0.33452 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}})}} $$\n$$ V_{A} = \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}}{\\sqrt{4.2037 \\times 10^{-28}}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx \\frac{20 \\times 10^{-9}}{2.0503 \\times 10^{-14}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 9.7547 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the dimensionless ratio $R$**\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{0.1\\, B_{0}\\, V_{A}} $$\nFirst, we compute the denominator:\n$$ 0.1\\, B_{0}\\, V_{A} = 0.1 \\times (20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\times (9.7547 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) $$\n$$ 0.1\\, B_{0}\\, V_{A} = 1.95094 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m} $$\nNow we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{2.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}}{1.95094 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/m}} \\approx 1.07640 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$ R \\approx 1.08 $$\nThe quantity $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} / (B_0 V_A)$ represents the dimensionless reconnection rate. A value of approximately $0.1$ is typical for fast, collisionless reconnection, which corresponds to our calculated $R \\approx 1$.",
