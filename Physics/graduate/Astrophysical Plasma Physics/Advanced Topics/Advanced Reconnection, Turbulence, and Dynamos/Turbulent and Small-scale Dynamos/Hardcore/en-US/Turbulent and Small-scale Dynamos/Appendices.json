A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the critical magnetic Reynolds number for a small-scale dynamo in the $Pm \\ll 1$ regime. We begin with the provided model for the net growth rate of magnetic energy at a scale $l$:\n$$\n\\gamma(l) \\sim \\sigma_{l} - \\frac{\\eta}{l^{2}}\n$$\nThe first term represents amplification by turbulent stretching, and the second term represents dissipation by Ohmic diffusion. The symbol `~` indicates proportionality. To obtain a specific functional form for estimation, we will treat the given scalings as approximate equalities, which is standard practice in such phenomenological models.\n\nThe local stretching rate $\\sigma_{l}$ is given by the scaling $\\sigma_{l} \\sim \\delta u_{l}/l$. The velocity increment $\\delta u_{l}$ scales as $\\delta u_{l} \\sim U(l/L)^{h}$. Combining these, we obtain the scale-dependent stretching rate:\n$$\n\\sigma_{l} \\sim \\frac{U(l/L)^{h}}{l} = \\frac{U}{L^{h}} l^{h-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the growth rate $\\gamma(l)$, we get:\n$$\n\\gamma(l) \\approx C \\frac{U}{L^{h}} l^{h-1} - \\frac{\\eta}{l^{2}}\n$$\nwhere we have included a constant of proportionality $C$ of order unity arising from the scaling relations. For the purpose of this estimate, we can set $C=1$, as is common in such arguments. The essential physics is captured by the powers of the variables. Thus, we analyze the function:\n$$\n\\gamma(l) = \\frac{U}{L^{h}} l^{h-1} - \\eta l^{-2}\n$$\nThe dynamo is most efficient at the scale $l_{\\ast}$ where this growth rate is maximal. To find $l_{\\ast}$, we differentiate $\\gamma(l)$ with respect to $l$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma}{dl} = \\frac{U}{L^{h}}(h-1)l^{h-2} - \\eta(-2)l^{-3} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(h-1)\\frac{U}{L^{h}}l_{\\ast}^{h-2} + 2\\eta l_{\\ast}^{-3} = 0\n$$\nSince $h \\in (0,1)$, the term $(h-1)$ is negative. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $l_{\\ast}$:\n$$\n2\\eta l_{\\ast}^{-3} = -(h-1)\\frac{U}{L^{h}}l_{\\ast}^{h-2} = (1-h)\\frac{U}{L^{h}}l_{\\ast}^{h-2}\n$$\nMultiplying by $l_{\\ast}^{3}$ and rearranging gives:\n$$\nl_{\\ast}^{h+1} = \\frac{2\\eta L^{h}}{(1-h)U}\n$$\nSolving for $l_{\\ast}$:\n$$\nl_{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{2\\eta L^{h}}{(1-h)U} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{h+1}}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we would check the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2\\gamma}{dl^2}$. It can be shown to be negative at $l=l_{\\ast}$ for $h \\in (0,1)$, confirming that $l_{\\ast}$ corresponds to a maximum growth rate.\n\nFor the dynamo mechanism to be considered part of the inertial-range dynamics, the scale of fastest growth $l_{\\ast}$ must be less than or equal to the outer scale of turbulence $L$. This gives the condition for the onset of dynamo action:\n$$\nl_{\\ast} \\leq L\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $l_{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{2\\eta L^{h}}{(1-h)U} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{h+1}} \\leq L\n$$\nTo simplify this inequality, we raise both sides to the power of $(h+1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\eta L^{h}}{(1-h)U} \\leq L^{h+1}\n$$\nWe can divide both sides by $L^h$ (since $L0$):\n$$\n\\frac{2\\eta}{(1-h)U} \\leq L\n$$\nRearranging the terms to group them into the magnetic Reynolds number, $Rm \\equiv UL/\\eta$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{1-h} \\leq \\frac{UL}{\\eta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2}{1-h} \\leq Rm\n$$\nThis inequality gives the condition for a self-sustaining small-scale dynamo. The critical magnetic Reynolds number, $Rm_{\\rm crit}$, is the minimum value of $Rm$ for which this condition is met. Therefore, our analytic estimate is:\n$$\nRm_{\\rm crit} = \\frac{2}{1-h}\n$$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical reason for the dependence of $Rm_{\\rm crit}$ on $h$, specifically why it is higher for smoother flows ($h \\to 1$).\nThe dynamo's efficacy hinges on the ability of the turbulent flow to stretch magnetic field lines. The intensity of this stretching is measured by $\\sigma_l \\sim l^{h-1}$. The exponent $h-1$ is negative for $h \\in (0,1)$, which means that stretching becomes stronger at smaller scales. This is the key to the small-scale dynamo: it operates most efficiently at small scales where stretching is most vigorous.\n\nIn the case of a very rough flow (e.g., $h=1/3$ for Kolmogorov turbulence), the exponent $h-1 = -2/3$ is significantly negative, indicating a strong enhancement of stretching at smaller scales. This makes the dynamo mechanism very efficient.\n\nAs the flow becomes smoother, the roughness exponent $h$ approaches $1$. In the limit $h \\to 1$, the exponent $h-1$ approaches $0$. The stretching rate $\\sigma_l \\sim l^{h-1}$ becomes nearly independent of the scale $l$. This means the flow lacks the strong differential stretching at small scales which is crucial for efficient magnetic field amplification. A flow with scale-independent stretching is far less effective at amplifying magnetic fields against diffusion.\n\nTo overcome this intrinsic inefficiency of a smooth flow, the overall amplitude of the turbulence, as measured by the magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$, must be substantially larger. Our derived result, $Rm_{\\rm crit} = 2/(1-h)$, mathematically captures this physical reality. As $h \\to 1$, the denominator $(1-h) \\to 0$, causing $Rm_{\\rm crit}$ to diverge. This signifies that an extremely high Reynolds number is required to trigger a dynamo in a flow that is almost smooth, consistent with the fact that smoother flows are poorer dynamos. The analysis is valid for the $Pm \\ll 1$ regime where the resistive scale falls within the rough inertial range characterized by $h1$.",

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\nThe problem describes the kinematic phase of a dynamo. In this phase, the magnetic field is too weak to exert a significant back-reaction (Lorentz force) on the fluid flow. The velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is thus considered a given, independent of $\\boldsymbol{B}$.

The time evolution of the field amplitude can therefore be described by the equation:\n$$\nB(t) = B_{0} \\exp(\\gamma_{k} t)\n$$\nThis exponential growth continues until the magnetic energy density becomes comparable to the kinetic energy density of the turbulent eddies at the relevant scale $l$. At this point, the Lorentz force is no longer negligible, the kinematic approximation breaks down, and the dynamo process enters a nonlinear saturation phase. The problem defines this saturation threshold by the equipartition condition, where the magnetic field strength reaches a value $B_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. This condition is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2}}{2\\,\\mu_{0}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho\\,u_{l}^{2}\n$$\nFrom this relation, we can solve for the equipartition magnetic field strength, $B_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{2} = \\mu_{0} \\rho u_{l}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}} = u_{l} \\sqrt{\\mu_{0} \\rho}\n$$\nThe saturation time, $t_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, is the time at which the growing magnetic field $B(t)$ reaches this equipartition value $B_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. We set $B(t_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = B_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}} = B_{0} \\exp(\\gamma_{k} t_{\\mathrm{sat}})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, we first divide by $B_{0}$ and then take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{B_{0}} = \\exp(\\gamma_{k} t_{\\mathrm{sat}})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{B_{0}}\\right) = \\gamma_{k} t_{\\mathrm{sat}}\n$$\nIsolating $t_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ gives the general symbolic solution:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{k}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{B_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $B_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we get:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{k}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{u_{l} \\sqrt{\\mu_{0} \\rho}}{B_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression. First, we compute the value of the equipartition field strength, $B_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}} = (1.2 \\times 10^{4}) \\sqrt{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (1.67 \\times 10^{-21})}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}} = (1.2 \\times 10^{4}) \\sqrt{2.09858... \\times 10^{-27}}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx (1.2 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (4.58103... \\times 10^{-14})\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx 5.4972... \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nNext, we compute the ratio $\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{B_{0}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{B_{0}} \\approx \\frac{5.4972... \\times 10^{-10}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-18}} = 5.4972... \\times 10^{8}\n$$\nNow we can calculate $t_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\frac{1}{2.50 \\times 10^{-12}} \\ln(5.4972... \\times 10^{8})\n$$\nThe value of the natural logarithm is:\n$$\n\\ln(5.4972... \\times 10^{8}) \\approx 20.1250...\n$$\nFinally, we compute $t_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\approx \\frac{20.1250...}{2.50 \\times 10^{-12}}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\approx 8.0500... \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\approx 8.05 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$",
