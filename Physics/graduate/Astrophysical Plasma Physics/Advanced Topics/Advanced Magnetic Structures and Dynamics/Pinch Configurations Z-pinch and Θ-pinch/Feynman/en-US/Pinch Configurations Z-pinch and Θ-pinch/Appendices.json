The term $\\frac{2C}{r^{2}}$ would diverge as $r \\to 0$ unless $C=0$. Setting $C=0$ ensures finite energy density and also satisfies the provided condition $B_{\\theta}(0)=0$.

Plasma beta, $\\beta \\equiv p / (B^2 / (2\\mu_0))$, is the ratio of plasma thermal pressure to magnetic pressure. It quantifies the relative importance of thermal and magnetic effects.\n\nIn the Z-pinch configuration, the confining magnetic field $B_\\theta$ is generated by the plasma's own axial current $J_z$. The result $\\beta_g = p(0) / (B^2(a) / (2\\mu_0)) = 2$ indicates that the peak thermal pressure on the axis is twice the magnetic pressure at the plasma-vacuum boundary. This is a $\\beta \\sim 1$ regime, meaning that thermal pressure and magnetic pressure are of comparable magnitude. The plasma is neither completely dominated by the magnetic field ($\\beta \\ll 1$, where plasma would be \"frozen\" to field lines) nor behaving like an unmagnetized fluid ($\\beta \\gg 1$, where the field would be passively carried by the plasma). The structure of the Z-pinch is inherently a balance between the inward Lorentz force and the outward pressure gradient, leading to this $\\beta \\sim 1$ state.\n\nIn contrast, the $\\theta$-pinch involves an externally applied axial magnetic field $B_z$ and an induced azimuthal plasma current $J_\\theta$. The static force balance equation $\\nabla p = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ becomes $\\frac{dp}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r = J_\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta \\times B_z \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z = J_\\theta B_z \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r$. Using Ampère's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{dB_z}{dr}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta = \\mu_0 J_\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta$, we find $J_\\theta = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\frac{dB_z}{dr}$. Substituting this into the force balance gives $\\frac{dp}{dr} = -\\frac{B_z}{\\mu_0}\\frac{dB_z}{dr} = -\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{B_z^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right)$. This integrates to $p(r) + \\frac{B_z(r)^2}{2\\mu_0} = \\text{constant}$. This relation shows that thermal pressure and magnetic pressure are in a \"pressure balance\". This structure allows for regimes where the plasma can be a high-beta plasma ($\\beta \\gg 1$). For example, a strong external field can confine a plasma that almost completely expels the magnetic field from its interior (a diamagnetic effect), resulting in high internal thermal pressure $p$ and a very low internal magnetic field $B_z$, hence a very high local beta. The Z-pinch, whose confining field is created by the plasma current itself, does not have this freedom and is intrinsically a $\\beta \\sim 1$ configuration.",

This implies $dr = 0$, meaning that the magnetic field lines lie on cylindrical surfaces of constant radius. We are particularly interested in the field lines at the plasma-vacuum interface, $r=a$, as their geometry governs the stability against external kink modes.
