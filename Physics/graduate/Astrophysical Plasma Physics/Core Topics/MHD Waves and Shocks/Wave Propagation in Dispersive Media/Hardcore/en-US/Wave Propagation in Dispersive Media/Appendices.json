            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, thus it is deemed valid. We proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe derivation starts from the linearized electron fluid equations for an unmagnetized, collisionless plasma, coupled with Poisson's equation. The equilibrium state is a uniform plasma with electron number density $n_0$, zero electron fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$, and zero electric field $\\mathbf{E}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. The ions form a stationary, charge-neutralizing background with density $n_i = n_0$.\n\nWe consider small perturbations from equilibrium:\n$n_e( \\mathbf{r}, t) = n_0 + n_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n$\\mathbf{v}_e(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{v}_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n$\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{E}_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n$P_e(\\mathbf{r}, t) = P_0 + P_1(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n\nThe fundamental equations are:\n1.  **Continuity Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial n_e}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n_e \\mathbf{v}_e) = 0$\n2.  **Momentum Equation:** $m_e n_e \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_e}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v}_e \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}_e\\right) = -e n_e \\mathbf{E} - \\nabla P_e$\n3.  **Poisson's Equation:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{e(n_i - n_e)}{\\varepsilon_0}$\n\nLinearizing these equations by keeping only first-order terms in the perturbations (e.g., $n_1, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{E}_1$) yields:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial t} + n_0 (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1) = 0$\n2.  $m_e n_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}_1}{\\partial t} = -e n_0 \\mathbf{E}_1 - \\nabla P_1$\n3.  $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1 = -\\frac{e n_1}{\\varepsilon_0}$\n\nTo close the system, we need an equation of state relating $P_1$ to $n_1$. For the one-dimensional compression characteristic of a Langmuir wave, the process is assumed to be adiabatic, governed by $P_e n_e^{-\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$. Linearizing this relation gives $\\frac{P_1}{P_0} = \\gamma \\frac{n_1}{n_0}$. Using the ideal gas law for the equilibrium pressure, $P_0 = n_0 k_B T_e$, we find the pressure perturbation: $P_1 = \\gamma k_B T_e n_1$. For one-dimensional longitudinal waves, kinetic theory justifies the use of an adiabatic index $\\gamma = 3$. Thus, $\\nabla P_1 = 3 k_B T_e \\nabla n_1$.\n\nWe seek plane wave solutions of the form $f_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = f_1 \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)]$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. This transforms the differential operators as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\to -i\\omega$ and $\\nabla \\to i\\mathbf{k}$. Since Langmuir waves are longitudinal, $\\mathbf{k} \\parallel \\mathbf{E}_1$, and we can treat the vector quantities as scalars ($k$, $v_1$, $E_1$) along the direction of propagation.\n\nThe linearized equations in Fourier space become:\n1.  $-i\\omega n_1 + i k n_0 v_1 = 0 \\implies \\omega n_1 = k n_0 v_1$\n2.  $-i\\omega m_e n_0 v_1 = -e n_0 E_1 - i k (3 k_B T_e n_1)$\n3.  $i k E_1 = -\\frac{e n_1}{\\varepsilon_0} \\implies E_1 = \\frac{i e n_1}{k \\varepsilon_0}$\n\nNow, we combine these algebraic equations to find the dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$.\nFrom (1), we express the velocity perturbation as $v_1 = \\frac{\\omega n_1}{k n_0}$.\nSubstitute the expression for $E_1$ from (3) into (2):\n$-i\\omega m_e n_0 v_1 = -e n_0 \\left(\\frac{i e n_1}{k \\varepsilon_0}\\right) - i k (3 k_B T_e n_1)$\n\nDividing by $-i n_1$ (assuming a non-trivial wave, $n_1 \\neq 0$):\n$\\omega m_e n_0 \\frac{v_1}{n_1} = \\frac{e^2 n_0}{k \\varepsilon_0} + 3 k k_B T_e$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $v_1/n_1 = \\omega/(k n_0)$ from (1):\n$\\omega m_e n_0 \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{k n_0}\\right) = \\frac{e^2 n_0}{k \\varepsilon_0} + 3 k k_B T_e$\n\n$\\frac{\\omega^2 m_e}{k} = \\frac{e^2 n_0}{k \\varepsilon_0} + 3 k k_B T_e$\n\nMultiplying by $k/m_e$ gives:\n$\\omega^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e} + 3 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e} k^2$\n\nThis is the Bohm-Gross dispersion relation for Langmuir waves, including the leading-order thermal correction. The first term is the square of the electron plasma frequency, $\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e}$. We can also define a characteristic electron thermal velocity squared as $v_{th}^2 = k_B T_e/m_e$. The dispersion relation is thus:\n$\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 + 3 v_{th}^2 k^2$\n\nNow we proceed with the numerical calculation. First, we convert the electron density to SI units:\n$n_e = 10^6 \\, \\text{cm}^{-3} = 10^6 \\times (10^{-2} \\, \\text{m})^{-3} = 10^{12} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the electron plasma frequency squared, using the provided constants:\n$\\omega_{pe}^2 = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_e} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}) (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C})^2}{(8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F m}^{-1})(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})}$\n$\\omega_{pe}^2 \\approx 3.18029 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{s}^{-2}$\n\nThe problem states $\\omega = 1.1\\,\\omega_{pe}$, so $\\omega^2 = (1.1)^2 \\omega_{pe}^2 = 1.21\\,\\omega_{pe}^2$.\nWe rearrange the dispersion relation to solve for the wavenumber $k$:\n$k^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2}{3 v_{th}^2} = \\frac{1.21\\,\\omega_{pe}^2 - \\omega_{pe}^2}{3(k_B T_e / m_e)} = \\frac{0.21\\,\\omega_{pe}^2}{3(k_B T_e / m_e)} = 0.07 \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2 m_e}{k_B T_e}$\n\nLet's calculate the value of $k^2$:\n$k_B T_e = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J K}^{-1})(10^5 \\, \\text{K}) = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}$\n$k^2 = 0.07 \\frac{(3.18029 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{s}^{-2})(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg})}{1.380649 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 146.882 \\, \\text{m}^{-2}$\n\nThe wavenumber $k$ is the positive root:\n$k = \\sqrt{146.882} \\approx 12.1195 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nThe wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k$:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{12.1195 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}} \\approx 0.51843 \\, \\text{m}$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the wavelength is $0.518 \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the validity of the warm correction and the fluid model. The fluid approximation requires that the wavelength of the phenomenon be much larger than the Debye length, $\\lambda \\gg \\lambda_D$. This condition is expressed as $k\\lambda_D \\ll 1$. The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is given by $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}$.\nWe can relate $k\\lambda_D$ directly to the parameters of the problem. From the dispersion relation:\n$\\omega^2 = \\omega_{pe}^2 (1 + 3 \\frac{k^2 v_{th}^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2}) = \\omega_{pe}^2 (1 + 3 k^2 (\\frac{v_{th}}{\\omega_{pe}})^2)$\nRecognizing that $\\lambda_D = v_{th}/\\omega_{pe}$, this becomes:\n$\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} = 1 + 3 (k\\lambda_D)^2$\nSolving for $k\\lambda_D$:\n$k\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{pe}^2} - 1\\right)}$\n\nUsing the given $\\omega = 1.1\\,\\omega_{pe}$:\n$k\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}\\left((1.1)^2 - 1\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{3}} = \\sqrt{0.07} \\approx 0.265$\n\nThe value $k\\lambda_D \\approx 0.265$ is less than $1$, but it is not \"much less than 1\". This indicates that the system is on the borderline of the fluid model's validity. When $k\\lambda_D$ is not small, kinetic effects that are ignored in the fluid model become important. The most significant of these is collisionless (Landau) damping. This damping arises from the resonant interaction of electrons with the wave, which occurs when the wave's phase velocity, $v_{ph} = \\omega/k$, is comparable to the electron thermal velocity.\n\nLet's evaluate the ratio of the phase velocity to the thermal velocity:\n$\\frac{v_{ph}}{v_{th}} = \\frac{\\omega/k}{v_{th}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{pe}} \\frac{\\omega_{pe}}{k v_{th}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{pe}} \\frac{1}{k\\lambda_D}$\n$\\frac{v_{ph}}{v_{th}} = \\frac{1.1}{\\sqrt{0.07}} \\approx \\frac{1.1}{0.265} \\approx 4.15$\n\nThe phase velocity is approximately $4.15$ times the thermal velocity. While this is large enough that the bulk of the electrons do not interact with the wave, there is a non-negligible population in the tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution that moves at speeds near $v_{ph}$. These electrons can exchange energy with the wave, leading to damping. Strong Landau damping typically occurs for $v_{ph}/v_{th} \\lesssim 3$. At $v_{ph}/v_{th} \\approx 4.15$, the damping is weak but not zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the thermal correction to the dispersion relation is essential, as it allows for wave propagation at $\\omega > \\omega_{pe}$. However, the very parameters that make the thermal correction significant ($k>0$) also push the system towards a regime where the underlying fluid model is only marginally valid. A more accurate kinetic treatment would reveal that the wave is damped over time and distance. The calculated wavelength is a valid first-order approximation, but the assumption of a purely real $\\omega$ and $k$ is an idealization.",

For electrons ($q_e=-e$) and singly ionized ions ($q_i=+e$), we have $\\lambda_{De}^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_0 e^2}$ and $\\lambda_{Di}^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_i}{n_0 e^2}$.\n- $v_{ts} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T_s}{m_s}}$ is the thermal speed of species $s$.\n- $\\xi_s = \\frac{\\omega}{k v_{ts}}$ is the ratio of the wave's phase speed to the thermal speed of species $s$.\n- $Z(\\xi_s)$ is the plasma dispersion function.\n\nThe problem specifies the ion-acoustic regime, where the phase speed $\\omega/k$ is between the ion and electron thermal speeds: $v_{ti} \\ll \\omega/k \\ll v_{te}$. This implies $|\\xi_i| \\gg 1$ and $|\\xi_e| \\ll 1$. We use the corresponding asymptotic expansions for $Z(\\xi_s)$:\nFor electrons ($|\\xi_e| \\ll 1$):\n$$ Z(\\xi_e) \\approx i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\exp(-\\xi_e^2) - 2\\xi_e(1 - \\frac{2}{3}\\xi_e^2 + \\dots) \\approx i\\sqrt{\\pi} - 2\\xi_e $$\nThe electron susceptibility becomes:\n$$ \\chi_e \\approx \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} [1 + \\xi_e(i\\sqrt{\\pi} - 2\\xi_e)] = \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} [1 - 2\\xi_e^2 + i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\xi_e] $$\nFor ions ($|\\xi_i| \\gg 1$), writing $\\omega = \\omega_r + i\\gamma$ with $|\\gamma| \\ll |\\omega_r|$:\n$$ Z(\\xi_i) \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\xi_i}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2\\xi_i^2} + \\frac{3}{4\\xi_i^4} + \\dots\\right) + i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\exp(-\\xi_i^2) $$\nThe ion susceptibility becomes:\n$$ \\chi_i \\approx \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{Di}^2} \\left[1 + \\xi_i\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\xi_i} - \\frac{1}{2\\xi_i^3} - \\frac{3}{4\\xi_i^5} + \\dots \\right) + i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\xi_i\\exp(-\\xi_i^2) \\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{Di}^2} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2\\xi_i^2} - \\frac{3}{4\\xi_i^4} + i\\sqrt{\\pi}\\xi_i\\exp(-\\xi_i^2) \\right] $$\nSubstituting $\\xi_i = \\omega/(k v_{ti})$ and $\\lambda_{Di}^2 = (k_B T_i / m_i) / \\omega_{pi}^2$ where $\\omega_{pi}^2 = n_0 e^2 / (\\epsilon_0 m_i)$, we can re-express the real part of $\\chi_i$:\n$$ \\text{Re}(\\chi_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{Di}^2} \\left[ -\\frac{k^2 v_{ti}^2}{2\\omega^2} - \\frac{3k^4 v_{ti}^4}{4\\omega^4} \\right] = -\\frac{v_{ti}^2}{2\\lambda_{Di}^2 \\omega^2} - \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^4}{4\\lambda_{Di}^2 \\omega^4} = -\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} - \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^2 \\omega_{pi}^2}{2\\omega^4} = -\\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^2}{2\\omega^2}\\right) $$\nThe full dispersion relation is $\\epsilon(k, \\omega) = 1 + \\chi_e + \\chi_i = 0$. We separate it into real and imaginary parts, $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r + i\\epsilon_i$.\n\nFirst, we find the real part of the frequency, $\\omega_r$, by solving $\\epsilon_r(k, \\omega_r) = 0$. Using the limit $k\\lambda_{De} \\ll 1$, the term $1/(k^2\\lambda_{De}^2)$ is dominant in $\\text{Re}(\\chi_e)$, so we take $\\text{Re}(\\chi_e) \\approx 1/(k^2\\lambda_{De}^2)$. The '1' from $1+\\chi_e+\\chi_i$ is also negligible compared to $1/(k^2\\lambda_{De}^2)$.\n$$ \\epsilon_r(k, \\omega_r) \\approx \\frac{1}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_r^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^2}{2\\omega_r^2}\\right) = 0 $$\nLet's define the ion sound speed $C_s = \\sqrt{k_B T_e/m_i}$. We can write $\\frac{1}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} = \\frac{n_0 e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e k^2} = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2 m_i}{k_B T_e k^2} = \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{k^2 C_s^2}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{k^2 C_s^2} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_r^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^2}{2\\omega_r^2}\\right) \\implies \\omega_r^2 \\approx k^2 C_s^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^2}{2\\omega_r^2}\\right) $$\nTo leading order, $\\omega_r^2 \\approx k^2 C_s^2$. Substituting this into the correction term gives:\n$$ \\omega_r^2 \\approx k^2 C_s^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{3k^2 v_{ti}^2}{2k^2 C_s^2}\\right) = k^2 C_s^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{3v_{ti}^2}{2C_s^2}\\right) $$\nUsing $v_{ti}^2 = 2k_B T_i/m_i$ and $C_s^2 = k_B T_e/m_i$, we get $\\frac{v_{ti}^2}{C_s^2} = 2\\frac{T_i}{T_e}$.\n$$ \\omega_r^2 \\approx k^2 C_s^2 \\left(1 + 3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}\\right) = k^2 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i} \\left(1 + 3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}\\right) $$\nThis is the real frequency including the leading finite-ion-temperature correction, as requested.\n\nNext, we calculate the damping rate $\\gamma$. For weak damping ($|\\gamma| \\ll |\\omega_r|$), $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$ \\gamma = - \\frac{\\epsilon_i(k, \\omega_r)}{\\partial \\epsilon_r / \\partial \\omega |_{\\omega=\\omega_r}} $$\nThe imaginary part of $\\epsilon$ receives contributions from both species. However, the condition $\\xi_i \\gg 1$ makes the ion contribution $\\text{Im}(\\chi_i) \\propto \\exp(-\\xi_i^2)$ exponentially small. The problem asks for the leading-order electron Landau damping, so we neglect ion damping.\n$$ \\epsilon_i(k, \\omega_r) \\approx \\text{Im}(\\chi_e) = \\frac{1}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} \\sqrt{\\pi}\\xi_e = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} \\frac{\\omega_r}{k v_{te}} $$\nThe derivative of the real part is, to lowest order:\n$$ \\epsilon_r(\\omega) \\approx \\frac{1}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} - \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_r}{\\partial \\omega} \\approx \\frac{2\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^3} $$\nAt $\\omega = \\omega_r$, and using $\\omega_r^2/(k^2 C_s^2) \\approx 1$, which means $\\omega_r^2 / \\omega_{pi}^2 \\approx k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_r}{\\partial \\omega} \\right|_{\\omega_r} \\approx \\frac{2\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega_r^3} \\approx \\frac{2}{\\omega_r^3} \\frac{\\omega_r^2}{k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} = \\frac{2}{\\omega_r k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} $$\nNow we assemble the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma \\approx - \\frac{ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{k^2 \\lambda_{De}^2} \\frac{\\omega_r}{k v_{te}} }{ \\frac{2}{\\omega_r k^2\\lambda_{De}^2} } = - \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\omega_r^2}{2kv_{te}} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\omega_r^2$ and the definitions for $C_s$ and $v_{te}$:\n$$ \\gamma = - \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2kv_{te}} \\left[ k^2 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i} \\left(1 + 3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}\\right) \\right] = - \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} k}{2\\sqrt{2k_B T_e/m_e}} \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i} \\left(1 + 3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}\\right) $$\n$$ \\gamma = -k \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{8}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_e}} \\frac{m_e}{m_i} \\left(1 + 3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}\\right) $$\nThis expression for $\\gamma(k)$ is the first required result.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the minimal temperature ratio $R = T_e/T_i$ for which the mode is \"weakly damped\". The criteria are:\n1. $|\\gamma|/\\omega_r \\leq \\delta$, with $\\delta=0.05$.\n2. $\\xi_i \\geq \\alpha$, with $\\alpha=2$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the ratio $|\\gamma|/\\omega_r$:\n$$ \\frac{|\\gamma|}{\\omega_r} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\omega_r^2/(2kv_{te})}{\\omega_r} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\omega_r}{2kv_{te}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi} k \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}(1+3T_i/T_e)}}{2k\\sqrt{2k_B T_e/m_e}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi m_e}{8m_i}} \\sqrt{1 + 3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}} $$\nCondition 1 becomes:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi m_e}{8m_i}} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3}{R}} \\leq \\delta $$\nFor any electron-ion plasma, $m_i \\gg m_e$. For a proton-electron plasma, $m_i/m_e \\approx 1836$. The left side is very small. For example, assuming $R \\ge 1$, we have $\\sqrt{1+3/R} \\le 2$. The term $\\sqrt{\\pi m_e/(8 m_i)} \\approx \\sqrt{\\pi/(8 \\times 1836)} \\approx 0.0146$. The product is $\\approx 0.029$, which is less than $\\delta=0.05$. Rearranging for $R$, we get $R \\geq 3 / (\\frac{8\\delta^2}{\\pi}\\frac{m_i}{m_e} - 1)$, which yields a very small lower bound on $R$ (e.g., $R \\gtrsim 0.28$ for hydrogen).\n\nNext, we evaluate Condition 2: $\\xi_i \\geq \\alpha = 2$.\n$$ \\xi_i^2 = \\frac{\\omega_r^2}{k^2 v_{ti}^2} = \\frac{k^2 \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}(1+3T_i/T_e)}{k^2 \\frac{2k_B T_i}{m_i}} = \\frac{T_e}{2T_i}\\left(1+3\\frac{T_i}{T_e}\\right) = \\frac{R}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{3}{R}\\right) = \\frac{R}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} $$\nThe condition $\\xi_i \\geq 2$ becomes $\\xi_i^2 \\geq 4$:\n$$ \\frac{R}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\geq 4 \\implies \\frac{R}{2} \\geq \\frac{5}{2} \\implies R \\geq 5 $$\nTo satisfy both conditions, $R$ must satisfy both inequalities. Since $5$ is a much more restrictive lower bound than the one derived from the first condition for any physical ion mass, the minimal temperature ratio is determined solely by the second condition.\nThe minimal value of $T_e/T_i$ is therefore $5$.\nThis result is an exact number derived from the given criteria.\n\nThe final answer is a matrix containing the expression for $\\gamma$ and the number $5$.",
