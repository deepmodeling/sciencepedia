            "problem": "A collisionless, magnetized astrophysical plasma is modeled as a gyrotropic fluid with distinct pressures perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field, denoted by $p_{\\perp}$ and $p_{\\parallel}$, respectively. In the double-adiabatic Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) theory, the perpendicular and parallel pressures follow adiabatic invariants that, for a fluid element, imply $p_{\\perp}$ scales with the product of mass density $\\rho$ and magnetic field strength $B$, and $p_{\\parallel}$ scales with $\\rho^{3}$ and $B^{-2}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective polytropic indices, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, for a collisionless, magnetized plasma described by the Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) double-adiabatic theory under two specific compression scenarios. The effective polytropic index is defined by the relation $p \\propto \\rho^{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$, where $p$ is the relevant pressure and $\\rho$ is the mass density.\n\nThe foundational principles provided are:\n1.  The CGL adiabatic invariants for a fluid element, which imply the following scalings for perpendicular pressure $p_{\\perp}$ and parallel pressure $p_{\\parallel}$:\n    $$p_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho B$$\n    $$p_{\\parallel} \\propto \\frac{\\rho^3}{B^2}$$\n    where $B$ is the magnetic field strength.\n\n2.  The conservation of magnetic flux (ideal MHD frozen-in condition) for a slender flux tube of cross-sectional area $A$:\n    $$\\Phi = B A = \\text{constant}$$\n\n3.  The conservation of mass for a fluid element within a segment of the flux tube of length $L$:\n    $$M = \\rho A L = \\text{constant}$$\n\nWe will analyze the two specified compression paths separately to determine the corresponding effective polytropic index.\n\n**Case 1: Perpendicular Compression**\n\nIn this scenario, the compression occurs such that the length of the flux tube segment, $L$, is held fixed, while its cross-sectional area, $A$, decreases. We are asked to find the effective polytropic index for the perpendicular pressure, $p_{\\perp}$. Let us denote this index as $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\perp}$. Our goal is to find the exponent in the relation $p_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho^{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\perp}}$.\n\nFrom the mass conservation principle, $\\rho A L$ is constant. Since $L$ is constant, this relation simplifies to:\n$$\\rho A = \\text{constant}$$\nThis implies that the mass density $\\rho$ is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\\rho \\propto \\frac{1}{A} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad A \\propto \\frac{1}{\\rho}$$\n\nNext, from the magnetic flux conservation principle, $B A$ is constant. This implies that the magnetic field strength $B$ is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$B \\propto \\frac{1}{A}$$\n\nWe can now establish a relationship between the magnetic field strength $B$ and the mass density $\\rho$. By substituting the expression for $A$ from the mass conservation result into the flux conservation result, we get:\n$$B \\propto \\frac{1}{A} \\propto \\frac{1}{1/\\rho} = \\rho$$\nThus, during a perpendicular compression, the magnetic field strength scales linearly with the mass density:\n$$B \\propto \\rho$$\n\nNow we use the CGL scaling for the perpendicular pressure, $p_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho B$. We substitute the derived relationship $B \\propto \\rho$ into this scaling:\n$$p_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho \\cdot B \\propto \\rho \\cdot \\rho = \\rho^2$$\n\nBy comparing this result, $p_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho^2$, with the definition of the effective polytropic index, $p_{\\perp} \\propto \\rho^{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\perp}}$, we can identify the index.\n$$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\perp} = 2$$\n\n**Case 2: Parallel Compression**\n\nIn this scenario, the compression occurs such that the cross-sectional area of the flux tube, $A$, is held fixed, while its length, $L$, decreases. We are asked to find the effective polytropic index for the parallel pressure, $p_{\\parallel}$. Let us denote this index as $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\parallel}$. Our goal is to find the exponent in the relation $p_{\\parallel} \\propto \\rho^{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\parallel}}$.\n\nFrom the magnetic flux conservation principle, $B A$ is constant. Since the cross-sectional area $A$ is held constant in this case, it follows that the magnetic field strength $B$ must also be constant:\n$$B = \\text{constant}$$\n\nNext, from the mass conservation principle, $\\rho A L$ is constant. Since $A$ is constant, this relation simplifies to:\n$$\\rho L = \\text{constant}$$\nThis implies that the mass density $\\rho$ is inversely proportional to the length of the flux tube segment $L$:\n$$\\rho \\propto \\frac{1}{L}$$\n\nNow we use the CGL scaling for the parallel pressure, $p_{\\parallel} \\propto \\rho^3 / B^2$. We have already established that for this compression path, the magnetic field strength $B$ is constant. Therefore, the term $B^2$ is also a constant and can be absorbed into the proportionality constant. The scaling for $p_{\\parallel}$ thus depends only on the mass density $\\rho$:\n$$p_{\\parallel} \\propto \\rho^3$$\n\nBy comparing this result, $p_{\\parallel} \\propto \\rho^3$, with the definition of the effective polytropic index, $p_{\\parallel} \\propto \\rho^{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\parallel}}$, we can identify the index.\n$$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\parallel} = 3$$\n\nIn summary, for perpendicular compression, the effective polytropic index for $p_{\\perp}$ is $2$. For parallel compression, the effective polytropic index for $p_{\\parallel}$ is $3$. The problem asks for these two values in a single row matrix.",

Its conservation for the plasma fluid leads to the first CGL equation of state:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{p_{\\perp}}{\\rho B}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{p_{\\perp}(t)}{\\rho(t) B(t)} = \\text{constant}\n$$\n- The second adiabatic invariant (longitudinal invariant) is $J = \\oint v_{\\parallel} ds$.

The linearized equations are:\n\n1.  **Mass Continuity**: $\\frac{\\partial \\delta \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 \\nabla \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{v} = 0$.\n    In Fourier space: $-i\\omega \\delta \\rho + i \\rho_0 (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{v}) = 0 \\implies \\omega \\delta \\rho = \\rho_0 k \\delta v_z$.\n\n2.  **Ideal Induction Equation**: $\\frac{\\partial \\delta \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\delta \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0)$.\n    In Fourier space: $-i\\omega \\delta \\mathbf{B} = i\\mathbf{k} \\times (\\delta \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}_0) = ik B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times (\\delta \\mathbf{v} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$.\n    Using the vector identity $\\mathbf{A} \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{C}) = \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}) - \\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$, we get:\n    $-i\\omega \\delta \\mathbf{B} = ik B_0 (\\delta \\mathbf{v} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{v})) = ik B_0 \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp$.\n    This implies $\\delta \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{k B_0}{\\omega} \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp$. A key consequence is that $\\delta \\mathbf{B}$ is purely transverse, so $\\delta B_z = 0$. The first-order perturbation to the magnetic field magnitude is $\\delta B = 0$.\n\n3.  **Double-Adiabatic Laws**: The closure relations for the CGL model are $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{p_\\perp}{\\rho B} \\right) = 0$ and $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{p_\\parallel B^2}{\\rho^3} \\right) = 0$. Linearizing these in Fourier space, and using $\\delta B=0$:\n    - $-i\\omega \\left( \\frac{\\delta p_\\perp}{p_{\\perp 0}} - \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho_0} \\right) = 0 \\implies \\delta p_\\perp = p_{\\perp 0} \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$.\n    - $-i\\omega \\left( \\frac{\\delta p_\\parallel}{p_{\\parallel 0}} - 3\\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho_0} \\right) = 0 \\implies \\delta p_\\parallel = 3 p_{\\parallel 0} \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho_0}$.\n\n4.  **Momentum Equation**: $\\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial \\delta \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\nabla \\times \\delta \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}_0$.\n    We need the linearized divergence of the pressure tensor, $\\nabla \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P}$. The perturbed pressure tensor is $\\delta \\mathbf{P} = \\delta p_\\perp \\mathbf{I} + (\\delta p_\\parallel - \\delta p_\\perp) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + (p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}) \\delta(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}})$.\n    The unit vector perturbation is $\\delta\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\perp}{B_0}$. So, $\\delta(\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}) = \\delta\\hat{\\mathbf{b}}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\delta\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\frac{\\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp}{B_0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\frac{\\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp}{B_0}$.\n    The divergence becomes $\\nabla \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P} = i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P} = ik\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P}$.\n    $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P} = \\delta p_\\perp \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + (\\delta p_\\parallel - \\delta p_\\perp)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + (p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}) \\left(\\frac{(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp)}{B_0}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\frac{\\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp}{B_0}\\right) = \\delta p_\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + (p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}) \\frac{\\delta\\mathbf{B}_\\perp}{B_0}$.\n    So, $\\nabla \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{P} = ik \\left( \\delta p_\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{B_0} \\delta \\mathbf{B}_\\perp \\right)$.\n    The momentum equation in Fourier space is:\n    $-i\\omega \\rho_0 \\delta \\mathbf{v} = - ik \\left( \\delta p_\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{B_0} \\delta \\mathbf{B} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (i\\mathbf{k} \\times \\delta \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}_0$.\n    The magnetic term simplifies to $\\frac{ikB_0}{\\mu_0}(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\delta \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{ikB_0}{\\mu_0}\\delta \\mathbf{B}$.\n    $-i\\omega \\rho_0 \\delta \\mathbf{v} = -ik \\delta p_\\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} - ik \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{B_0} \\delta \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{ikB_0}{\\mu_0} \\delta \\mathbf{B}$.\n\nFor transverse waves, we look for solutions with $\\delta \\mathbf{v} = \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp$ and $\\delta v_z = 0$. This implies $\\delta \\rho = 0$, and thus $\\delta p_\\perp = 0$ and $\\delta p_\\parallel = 0$. The momentum equation's component along $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is trivially satisfied ($0=0$), and the perpendicular component becomes:\n$-i\\omega \\rho_0 \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp = -ik \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{B_0} \\delta \\mathbf{B} + \\frac{ikB_0}{\\mu_0} \\delta \\mathbf{B}$.\nSubstitute $\\delta \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{k B_0}{\\omega} \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp$:\n$-i\\omega \\rho_0 \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp = -ik \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{B_0} \\left(-\\frac{k B_0}{\\omega} \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp\\right) + \\frac{ikB_0}{\\mu_0} \\left(-\\frac{k B_0}{\\omega} \\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp\\right)$.\nAssuming a non-trivial solution $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp \\ne 0$, we cancel $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_\\perp$ and $-i$:\n$\\omega \\rho_0 = - \\frac{k^2}{\\omega}(p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}) + \\frac{k^2 B_0^2}{\\mu_0 \\omega}$.\nMultiplying by $\\omega$ and dividing by $\\rho_0$ yields the dispersion relation:\n$$ \\omega^2 = k^2 \\left( \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0 \\rho_0} - \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{\\rho_0} \\right) $$\nDefining the Alfvén speed $v_A = \\sqrt{B_0^2 / (\\mu_0 \\rho_0)}$, this is $\\omega^2 = k^2 \\left(v_A^2 - \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{\\rho_0} \\right)$.\n\n### Firehose Instability Condition and Growth Rate\n\nInstability occurs when $\\omega^2 < 0$, which means $\\omega$ becomes purely imaginary ($\\omega = i\\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the growth rate). The condition for instability is:\n$v_A^2 - \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{\\rho_0} < 0$, which is equivalent to:\n$$ p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0} > \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0} $$\nThis is the firehose instability criterion. It is triggered when the pressure anisotropy exceeds the magnetic pressure.\nThe growth rate $\\gamma$ is given by $\\gamma^2 = -\\omega^2$:\n$$ \\gamma^2 = k^2 \\left( \\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{\\rho_0} - \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0 \\rho_0} \\right) \\quad \\implies \\quad \\gamma = |k| \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0}}{\\rho_0} - v_A^2} $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe now use the provided parameters to evaluate the stability and compute the fastest-growing wavenumber.\n1.  **Check Instability Condition**: We check if $p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0} > \\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0}$.\n    -   Pressure anisotropy term: $p_{\\parallel 0} - p_{\\perp 0} = (3.0 \\times 10^{-11} - 6.0 \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\text{Pa} = 2.4 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{Pa}$.\n    -   Magnetic pressure term: $\\frac{B_0^2}{\\mu_0} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{T})^2}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{N}\\,\\text{A}^{-2}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-17}}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}}\\ \\text{Pa} \\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{Pa}$.\n    -   Since $2.4 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{Pa} > 1.989 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\text{Pa}$, the criterion is met. The plasma is firehose unstable. The stability verdict is $1$.\n\n2.  **Compute Fastest-Growing Wavenumber $k_{\\text{fg}}$**:\n    The growth rate $\\gamma$ is directly proportional to the wavenumber $k$. The problem defines the fastest-growing mode as the one corresponding to the maximum wavenumber $k_{\\text{fg}}$ allowed by the CGL validity criterion, $k \\rho_i \\le \\epsilon = 0.1$. Therefore, $k_{\\text{fg}} = \\epsilon / \\rho_i$.\n    We must calculate the ion Larmor radius $\\rho_i = v_{\\perp \\text{th}}/\\Omega_i$.\n\n    -   **Perpendicular thermal speed $v_{\\perp \\text{th}}$**:\n        $v_{\\perp \\text{th}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 p_{\\perp 0}}{\\rho_0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{Pa})}{8.0 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}}} = \\sqrt{1.5 \\times 10^9}\\ \\text{m/s} \\approx 38729.8\\ \\text{m/s}$.\n\n    -   **Ion gyrofrequency $\\Omega_i$**:\n        $\\Omega_i = \\frac{q_i B_0}{m_i} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{T})}{1.67262192369 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\text{kg}} \\approx 0.47895\\ \\text{rad/s}$.\n\n    -   **Ion Larmor radius $\\rho_i$**:\n        $\\rho_i = \\frac{v_{\\perp \\text{th}}}{\\Omega_i} \\approx \\frac{38729.8\\ \\text{m/s}}{0.47895\\ \\text{rad/s}} \\approx 80863\\ \\text{m}$.\n\n    -   **Fastest-growing wavenumber $k_{\\text{fg}}$**:\n        $k_{\\text{fg}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\rho_i} = \\frac{0.1}{80863\\ \\text{m}} \\approx 1.23666 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $k_{\\text{fg}} = 1.24 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final composite result consists of the stability verdict ($1$) and the calculated wavenumber $k_{\\text{fg}}$.",
