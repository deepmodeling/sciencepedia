It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in plasma physics. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the scaling of Spitzer resistivity, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}$, with the effective ion charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and for a subsequent calculation.\n\nWe begin with the definition of electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$, from a simple momentum-balance (Drude-like) model for electrons in a plasma. In steady state, the force on the electron fluid from a uniform DC electric field, $\\mathbf{E}$, is balanced by the frictional drag from collisions with ions. The electron momentum equation is:\n$$ 0 = -n_e e \\mathbf{E} - n_e m_e \\nu_{ei} \\mathbf{u}_e $$\nwhere $-e$ is the electron charge, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $n_e$ is the electron number density, $\\mathbf{u}_e$ is the mean electron fluid velocity (drift velocity), and $\\nu_{ei}$ is the total momentum-transfer collision frequency for electrons with all ion species.\n\nThe electric current density is given by $\\mathbf{j} = -n_e e \\mathbf{u}_e$. Rearranging the momentum equation for $\\mathbf{u}_e$ gives $\\mathbf{u}_e = -\\frac{e \\mathbf{E}}{m_e \\nu_{ei}}$. Substituting this into the expression for current density yields:\n$$ \\mathbf{j} = -n_e e \\left( -\\frac{e \\mathbf{E}}{m_e \\nu_{ei}} \\right) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}} \\mathbf{E} $$\nBy Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{j} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$, the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ is:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\nu_{ei}} $$\nThe electrical resistivity, $\\eta$, is the inverse of conductivity, $\\eta = 1/\\sigma$. Therefore:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{m_e \\nu_{ei}}{n_e e^2} $$\nThe total electron-ion collision frequency, $\\nu_{ei}$, in a plasma with multiple ion species is the sum of the collision frequencies with each species $i$:\n$$ \\nu_{ei} = \\sum_i \\nu_{ei}^{(i)} $$\nFrom kinetic theory for small-angle Coulomb collisions in a Maxwellian plasma, the momentum-transfer frequency for electrons colliding with an ion species $i$ of charge $Z_i e$ and number density $n_i$ is given by:\n$$ \\nu_{ei}^{(i)} = n_i \\frac{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{3} \\left( \\frac{Z_i e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\right)^2 \\frac{\\ln \\Lambda}{m_e^{1/2} (k_B T_e)^{3/2}} $$\nwhere $\\ln \\Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm, $T_e$ is the electron temperature, $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. From this expression, we can see the scaling relationship:\n$$ \\nu_{ei}^{(i)} \\propto n_i Z_i^2 T_e^{-3/2} \\ln \\Lambda $$\nThe total collision frequency is then:\n$$ \\nu_{ei} = \\sum_i \\nu_{ei}^{(i)} \\propto \\left( \\sum_i n_i Z_i^2 \\right) T_e^{-3/2} \\ln \\Lambda $$\nSubstituting this scaling for $\\nu_{ei}$ into the expression for resistivity $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta \\propto \\frac{\\left( \\sum_i n_i Z_i^2 \\right) T_e^{-3/2} \\ln \\Lambda}{n_e} $$\nThe problem introduces the effective charge number, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, defined as:\n$$ Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_i n_i Z_i^2}{\\sum_i n_i Z_i} $$\nThe plasma is quasineutral, so the electron density is $n_e = \\sum_i n_i Z_i$. We can thus rewrite the sum in the numerator as $\\sum_i n_i Z_i^2 = n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Substituting this into the resistivity scaling gives:\n$$ \\eta \\propto \\frac{(n_e Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}) T_e^{-3/2} \\ln \\Lambda}{n_e} $$\n$$ \\eta \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} T_e^{-3/2} \\ln \\Lambda $$\nThis is the classical Spitzer resistivity scaling, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}$. For fixed $T_e$ and $\\ln \\Lambda$, the resistivity is directly proportional to the effective charge:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the task. We note that this simplified derivation neglects a weak dependence on $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that arises from a full kinetic treatment (the Spitzer-Härm factor), but it correctly captures the primary scaling requested by the problem.\n\nNext, we compute $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the given mixture of hydrogen ($Z_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1, n_{\\mathrm{H}} = 9.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$) and carbon ($Z_{\\mathrm{C}} = 6, n_{\\mathrm{C}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$).\nThe numerator of the $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ expression is:\n$$ \\sum_i n_i Z_i^2 = n_{\\mathrm{H}} Z_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{C}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}}^2 = (9.0 \\times 10^{19})(1)^2 + (1.0 \\times 10^{19})(6)^2 $$\n$$ = (9.0 \\times 10^{19}) + (36.0 \\times 10^{19}) = 45.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3} $$\nThe denominator is the electron density $n_e$:\n$$ n_e = \\sum_i n_i Z_i = n_{\\mathrm{H}} Z_{\\mathrm{H}} + n_{\\mathrm{C}} Z_{\\mathrm{C}} = (9.0 \\times 10^{19})(1) + (1.0 \\times 10^{19})(6) $$\n$$ = (9.0 \\times 10^{19}) + (6.0 \\times 10^{19}) = 15.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3} $$\nThe effective charge for the mixture, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(mix)}}$, is the ratio:\n$$ Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(mix)}} = \\frac{45.0 \\times 10^{19}}{15.0 \\times 10^{19}} = 3.0 $$\nThe reference case is a pure hydrogen plasma. For a pure plasma, there is only one ion species ($i=H$), so $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ simplifies to the ion charge number:\n$$ Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(H)}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{H}} Z_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{n_{\\mathrm{H}} Z_{\\mathrm{H}}} = Z_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1 $$\nFinally, we evaluate the multiplicative change in resistivity. The problem states that $T_e$ and $\\ln \\Lambda$ are the same for the mixture and the pure hydrogen plasma. Based on our derived scaling, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}} \\propto Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the ratio of resistivities is equal to the ratio of the effective charge numbers:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}^{\\mathrm{(mix)}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}^{\\mathrm{(H)}}} = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(mix)}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{(H)}}} = \\frac{3.0}{1} = 3.0 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}^{\\mathrm{(mix)}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{Sp}}^{\\mathrm{(H)}}} = 3.000 $$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln \\Lambda$, for a specified astrophysical plasma.

The Long-Distance Cutoff, $b_{\\max}$**\n\nThe long-distance cutoff, $b_{\\max}$, represents the maximum impact parameter beyond which the Coulomb interaction between two charged particles becomes ineffective. Two physical phenomena impose such a limit.\n\nFirst, in a plasma, the electrostatic potential of a test charge is screened by the surrounding mobile charges. This collective effect, known as Debye screening, limits the range of the potential to the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. Beyond this distance, the potential of a given charge is effectively neutralized. For a plasma with electrons at temperature $T_e$ and number density $n_e$, the Debye length is given by:\n$$\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}$$\nUsing the SI values:\n$$\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{(8.854\\,187... \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) (8.01088... \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J})}{(1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) (1.602\\,176... \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}} \\approx 1.6620 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nSecond, the presence of a magnetic field confines charged particles to helical trajectories along the magnetic field lines. The radius of this circular motion is the Larmor radius, $r_L$. This confinement restricts the distance over which an electron can interact with another particle in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. The Larmor radius is determined by balancing the magnetic Lorentz force with the centripetal force: $e v_\\perp B = m_e v_\\perp^2 / r_L$. This gives $r_L = m_e v_\\perp / (e B)$. For the characteristic perpendicular speed $v_\\perp$, we use the thermal speed $v_{\\mathrm{th}}$ defined in the problem as $v_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{2 k_B T_e / m_e}$. Thus, the electron Larmor radius is:\n$$r_L = \\frac{m_e v_{\\mathrm{th}}}{e B} = \\frac{m_e}{e B} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T_e}{m_e}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_e k_B T_e}}{e B}$$\nUsing the SI values:\n$$r_L = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 (9.109\\,383... \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (8.01088... \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J})}}{(1.602\\,176... \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{T})} \\approx 2.3844 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe effective maximum impact parameter $b_{\\max}$ is the smaller of these two length scales, as an interaction is cut off by whichever effect occurs over the shorter distance.\n$$b_{\\max} = \\min(\\lambda_D, r_L)$$\nComparing the calculated values:\n$$\\lambda_D \\approx 1.66 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_L \\approx 2.38 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nWe see that $\\lambda_D \\ll r_L$. Therefore, Debye screening is the dominant cutoff mechanism at long distances for this plasma.\n$$b_{\\max} = \\lambda_D \\approx 1.6620 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**2. The Short-Distance Cutoff, $b_{\\min}$**\n\nThe short-distance cutoff, $b_{\\min}$, represents the minimum impact parameter for which the standard collisional theory (based on small-angle scattering) is valid. Two physical considerations provide this lower limit.\n\nFirst, the classical picture breaks down for very small impact parameters that lead to large-angle scattering events ($ 90^\\circ$). The Spitzer model is based on the cumulative effect of many small-angle deflections. A convenient classical cutoff, $b_c$, is the impact parameter that corresponds to a $90^\\circ$ deflection. For an electron scattering off a stationary ion of charge $Ze$, this is given by equating the initial kinetic energy and the Coulomb potential energy at the distance of closest approach. A common definition for this cutoff equates the potential energy at distance $b_{c}$ to the characteristic kinetic energy. For a $90^\\circ$ deflection, the distance of closest approach is equal to the impact parameter $b$. Equating the potential energy to twice the average kinetic energy, $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}m_e v_{th}^2 = m_e v_{th}^2 = 2 k_B T_e$, gives the classical cutoff for a $Z=1$ ion:\n$$b_c = \\frac{Z e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 (m_e v_{\\mathrm{th}}^2)} = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 (2 k_B T_e)} = \\frac{e^2}{8 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}$$\nUsing the SI values:\n$$b_c = \\frac{(1.602\\,176... \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}{8 \\pi (8.854\\,187... \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) (8.01088... \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J})} \\approx 1.4404 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nSecond, quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit on how well a particle can be localized. According to the uncertainty principle, an electron with thermal momentum $p = m_e v_{\\mathrm{th}}$ cannot be localized to a region smaller than its thermal de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda_{dB}$. This sets a quantum mechanical lower limit on the impact parameter.\n$$\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{m_e v_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 m_e k_B T_e}}$$\nUsing the SI values:\n$$\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{6.626\\,070... \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}}{\\sqrt{2 (9.109\\,383... \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (8.01088... \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{J})}} \\approx 1.7345 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe effective minimum impact parameter $b_{\\min}$ must be the larger of these two cutoffs because a collision cannot be treated classically at a length scale smaller than the quantum uncertainty in position.\n$$b_{\\min} = \\max(b_c, \\lambda_{dB})$$\nComparing the calculated values:\n$$b_c \\approx 1.44 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_{dB} \\approx 1.73 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nWe find that $b_c \\ll \\lambda_{dB}$. For this hot plasma, the quantum diffraction limit is dominant.\n$$b_{\\min} = \\lambda_{dB} \\approx 1.7345 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Coulomb Logarithm, $\\ln \\Lambda$**\n\nWith the physically justified cutoffs determined, we can now compute the argument of the logarithm, $\\Lambda$, and then the logarithm itself.\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{b_{\\max}}{b_{\\min}} = \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_{dB}}$$\nUsing the more precise values calculated earlier:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{1.66197... \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}}{1.73450... \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 9.5818 \\times 10^{14}$$\nThe Coulomb logarithm is the natural logarithm of this ratio:\n$$\\ln \\Lambda = \\ln(9.5818 \\times 10^{14}) \\approx 34.4984$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $34.50$.",

            "solution": "The problem is divided into two parts: ($a$) a qualitative explanation of the limitations of the truncated Sonine expansion for calculating collisional transport coefficients, and ($b$) a quantitative calculation of the error in the Spitzer resistivity when using a truncated expansion.\n\n($a$) The calculation of transport coefficients like electrical resistivity in a plasma from first principles begins with the solution of the Fokker–Planck (FP) kinetic equation for the electron distribution function, $f_e$. In the presence of a weak electric field $E$, the distribution function is perturbed slightly from its equilibrium Maxwellian form, $f_M$. We can write $f_e = f_M + \\delta f$, where the perturbation $|\\delta f| \\ll f_M$. Substituting this into the FP equation and retaining only terms linear in $\\delta f$ and $E$ yields a linearized kinetic equation for $\\delta f$.\n\nThe electric field drives an electric current, which is carried by the anisotropic part of the distribution function. This anisotropy is captured by projecting the kinetic equation onto the $l=1$ spherical harmonic (the Legendre polynomial $P_1(\\cos \\theta) = v_x/v$, where $v_x$ is the velocity component along the electric field). This results in an equation for the velocity-dependent part of the $l=1$ component of $\\delta f$. To solve this equation, one employs a spectral method, expanding the velocity dependence in a basis of orthogonal polynomials. For perturbations around a Maxwellian, the natural basis functions are the generalized Sonine polynomials, $S_{n}^{(3/2)}(x)$, where $x=m_e v^2 / (2 k_B T_e)$ is the dimensionless kinetic energy. These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the Maxwellian-weighted inner product.\n\nThe core limitation of truncating this expansion arises from the complex velocity dependence of the Coulomb collision operator. The collision frequency between electrons and ions, $\\nu_{ei}$, is not constant but is strongly dependent on the electron speed $v$, scaling as $\\nu_{ei}(v) \\propto v^{-3}$. This means that low-energy (slow) electrons are highly collisional and are easily scattered, while high-energy (fast) electrons are nearly collisionless.\n\nWhen the Sonine expansion is truncated, for instance, by retaining only the leading term ($n=0$), the solution for the perturbation $\\delta f$ is approximated by a function proportional to the first Sonine polynomial, $S_{0}^{(3/2)}(x)$, which is a constant. This assumes a very simple velocity structure for the perturbation that does not accurately represent the physical situation. The electric field accelerates all electrons, but the velocity-dependent collision frequency means that slow electrons are immediately scattered, while fast electrons continue to accelerate, gaining energy and becoming even less collisional. This process creates a significant distortion in the electron distribution function, where there is a deficit of slow electrons and a surplus of fast-moving electrons in the direction of the electric field, relative to a simple shifted Maxwellian.\n\nThese distortions are described by the higher-order Sonine polynomials ($n \\ge 1$). For example, the $n=1$ polynomial, $S_{1}^{(3/2)}(x) = \\frac{5}{2} - x$, accounts for heat flow and the primary energy-dependent correction. By truncating the series at the leading term, one effectively averages the collision frequency over the entire distribution, neglecting the crucial fact that a small number of high-energy, low-collisionality electrons can carry a disproportionate fraction of the total electric current. This failure to account for the \"runaway\" tendency of faster electrons leads to an underestimation of the true electrical conductivity, or equivalently, an overestimation of the resistivity. The truncated approach is only exact in the unphysical limit of a constant collision frequency, where the collision operator's matrix representation, $C_{nm}$, would be diagonal. For realistic Coulomb collisions in a plasma with finite ion charge $Z_i$, $C_{nm}$ is a full matrix, and its off-diagonal elements couple the different Sonine modes, reflecting the complex nature of the collision process. The accuracy of the calculated resistivity therefore depends on the number of terms retained in the expansion, with the full \"Spitzer\" result corresponding to the solution of the infinite system.\n\n($b$) We now compute the quantitative error resulting from a one-term truncation compared to a two-term truncation.\n\nFirst, we consider the leading-term approximation, which retains only the $n=0$ term. The coefficient $a_0^{(1)}$ is given by\n$$\na_0^{(1)} = \\frac{b_0}{C_{00}}\n$$\nUsing the provided values, $b_0 = 1$ and $C_{00} = 1$:\n$$\na_0^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\nThe resistivity in this approximation is $\\eta_{(1)} \\propto 1/a_0^{(1)}$.\n\nNext, we consider the two-mode Galerkin model, where the expansion is truncated after $n=1$. The coefficients $a_0^{(2)}$ and $a_1^{(2)}$ are found by solving the $2 \\times 2$ linear system:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{00}  C_{01} \\\\\nC_{10}  C_{11}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{0}^{(2)} \\\\\na_{1}^{(2)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb_{0} \\\\\nb_{1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the given dimensionless values $C_{00} = 1$, $C_{11} = 6$, $C_{01} = C_{10} = 0.4$, $b_0 = 1$, and $b_1 = 0.15$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0.4 \\\\\n0.4  6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{0}^{(2)} \\\\\na_{1}^{(2)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0.15\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe only need to solve for $a_0^{(2)}$ to find the resistivity. We can use Cramer's rule. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is:\n$$\n\\det(C) = (C_{00})(C_{11}) - (C_{01})(C_{10}) = (1)(6) - (0.4)(0.4) = 6 - 0.16 = 5.84\n$$\nThe numerator for the solution of $a_0^{(2)}$ is the determinant of the matrix with the first column replaced by the vector $b$:\n$$\n\\det(C_{a_0}) = (b_0)(C_{11}) - (C_{01})(b_1) = (1)(6) - (0.4)(0.15) = 6 - 0.06 = 5.94\n$$\nThus, the solution for $a_0^{(2)}$ is:\n$$\na_0^{(2)} = \\frac{\\det(C_{a_0})}{\\det(C)} = \\frac{5.94}{5.84} = \\frac{297}{292}\n$$\nThe resistivity in this two-term approximation is $\\eta_{(2)} \\propto 1/a_0^{(2)}$.\n\nThe relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\eta}$ resulting from retaining only the leading term is defined as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\eta} = \\frac{\\eta_{(1)} - \\eta_{(2)}}{\\eta_{(2)}}\n$$\nSince resistivity is inversely proportional to the coefficient $a_0$, let $\\eta_{(k)} = \\kappa/a_0^{(k)}$ for some constant of proportionality $\\kappa$. Substituting this into the error formula:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\eta} = \\frac{\\kappa/a_0^{(1)} - \\kappa/a_0^{(2)}}{\\kappa/a_0^{(2)}} = \\frac{1/a_0^{(1)}}{1/a_0^{(2)}} - 1 = \\frac{a_0^{(2)}}{a_0^{(1)}} - 1\n$$\nNow we substitute the computed values for $a_0^{(1)}$ and $a_0^{(2)}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\eta} = \\frac{297/292}{1} - 1 = \\frac{297}{292} - \\frac{292}{292} = \\frac{5}{292}\n$$\nTo obtain the final numerical result, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\eta} = \\frac{5}{292} \\approx 0.017123287...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\eta} \\approx 0.01712\n$$",
