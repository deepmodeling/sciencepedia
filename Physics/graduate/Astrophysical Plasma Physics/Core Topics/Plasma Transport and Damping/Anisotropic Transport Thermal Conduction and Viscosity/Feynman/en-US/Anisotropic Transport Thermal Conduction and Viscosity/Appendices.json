This first practice explores parallel thermal conduction, which is dominated by the motion of the lightest and most mobile charged particles: the electrons. By deriving the ratio of electron to ion parallel conductivity, $\\kappa_{e\\parallel}/\\kappa_{i\\parallel}$, from basic kinetic principles, you will gain a quantitative understanding of why ion heat conduction is often negligible in astrophysical models. This is a crucial simplification for studying phenomena like the solar wind and galaxy clusters .",

Let $s \\in \\{e,i\\}$ label species ($e$ for electrons, $i$ for ions), with number density $n_s$, temperature $T_s$, mass $m_s$, and thermal speed $v_{ts} \\equiv \\sqrt{2 k_B T_s/m_s}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The parallel heat flux of species $s$ is described by $q_{s\\parallel} = - \\kappa_{s\\parallel} \\partial_{\\parallel} T_s$, where $\\kappa_{s\\parallel}$ is the parallel thermal conductivity.

The dependence $\\propto T^{5/2}$ arises from the product of the energy-carrying capacity and the collision time scaling, and the mass dependence enters through both the thermal speed and collision dynamics.\n\nTo evaluate for a hydrogen plasma with $T_e = T_i$ and $m_i/m_e = 1836$, we set $T_e/T_i = 1$:\n$$\\frac{\\kappa_{e\\parallel}}{\\kappa_{i\\parallel}} \\sim \\left( 1 \\right)^{5/2} \\left( \\frac{m_i}{m_e} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{1836}.$$\n\nWe now compute the square root.

Consequently, ion heat conduction can be safely neglected in many astrophysical contexts when estimating parallel heat transport, with electrons dominating the energy flux along magnetic field lines.",

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular electron heat flux, $q_{\\parallel}/q_{\\perp}$, in a strongly magnetized, weakly collisional plasma. The derivation will be constructed from the fundamental principles provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe electron heat flux $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is driven by the electron temperature gradient $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} T_{e}$. In an anisotropic medium with a uniform magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$, this relationship is described by a thermal conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{q} = - \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} T_{e}\n$$\nWe define the direction parallel to the magnetic field with the unit vector $\\boldsymbol{b} = \\boldsymbol{B}/B$. The component of the heat flux parallel to $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is given by:\n$$\nq_{\\parallel} = \\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} = - \\kappa_{\\parallel} (\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} T_{e} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}) = - \\kappa_{\\parallel} \\nabla_{\\parallel} T_{e}\n$$\nThe component of the heat flux perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{q}_{\\perp} = \\boldsymbol{q} - q_{\\parallel} \\boldsymbol{b} = - \\kappa_{\\perp} \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\perp} T_{e}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the perpendicular heat flux is therefore $q_{\\perp} = \\kappa_{\\perp} |\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\perp} T_{e}|$.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitudes of the heat fluxes is:\n$$\n\\frac{q_{\\parallel}}{q_{\\perp}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\parallel} |\\nabla_{\\parallel} T_{e}|}{\\kappa_{\\perp} |\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\perp} T_{e}|}\n$$\nThis ratio depends on the structure of the temperature gradient. To isolate the intrinsic anisotropy of the transport process itself, we evaluate this ratio under the condition where the characteristic scale-lengths of the temperature variation are comparable in both directions, i.e., $|\\nabla_{\\parallel} T_{e}| \\approx |\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\perp} T_{e}|$. In this case, the ratio of the heat fluxes is approximately equal to the ratio of the thermal conductivities:\n$$\n\\frac{q_{\\parallel}}{q_{\\perp}} \\approx \\frac{\\kappa_{\\parallel}}{\\kappa_{\\perp}}\n$$\nOur task reduces to finding the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular thermal conductivities, $\\kappa_{\\parallel}/\\kappa_{\\perp}$.\n\nAccording to the problem's specified base, the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ is proportional to the product of a specific heat per particle (of order the Boltzmann constant $k_B$) and an appropriate diffusion coefficient $D$. Assuming the proportionality factor is an isotropic scalar, the ratio of conductivities is equal to the ratio of diffusion coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_{\\parallel}}{\\kappa_{\\perp}} \\propto \\frac{D_{\\parallel}}{D_{\\perp}}\n$$\nWe can assume the proportionality constants cancel to yield an equality for the ratio.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient $D$ is described by a random-walk process, where $D \\sim \\ell^{2}/\\tau_{\\text{corr}}$, with $\\ell$ being the characteristic step size and $\\tau_{\\text{corr}}$ being the correlation time of the walk. We apply this model to electron motion parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nFirst, we consider transport parallel to $\\boldsymbol{B}$. The magnetic field does not constrain electron motion along the field lines. The motion is effectively a $1$-dimensional random walk, where an electron travels freely until it is scattered by a collision.\nThe characteristic step size $\\ell_{\\parallel}$ for this process is the mean free path $\\lambda$, which is the average distance traveled between collisions.\nThe correlation time $\\tau_{\\text{corr}, \\parallel}$ is the average time between scattering events, which is the collision time $\\tau$.\nThe parallel diffusion coefficient is therefore:\n$$\nD_{\\parallel} \\sim \\frac{\\ell_{\\parallel}^{2}}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}, \\parallel}} = \\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{\\tau}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider transport perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}$. In a strong magnetic field (where $\\rho \\ll \\lambda$, or equivalently, $\\omega_{ce} \\tau \\gg 1$), an electron's motion is dominated by rapid gyration around a magnetic field line. A collision causes an abrupt change in the electron's velocity, which in turn causes the center of its gyration (the guiding center) to jump to a new position on a different field line. Perpendicular transport is thus a $2$-dimensional random walk of these guiding centers.\nThe characteristic step size $\\ell_{\\perp}$ of this random walk is the size of the gyro-orbit, which is of the order of the Larmor radius $\\rho$.\nThe correlation time $\\tau_{\\text{corr}, \\perp}$ is the time between these random jumps, which is again the collision time $\\tau$, since collisions are the causal event.\nThe perpendicular diffusion coefficient is therefore:\n$$\nD_{\\perp} \\sim \\frac{\\ell_{\\perp}^{2}}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}, \\perp}} = \\frac{\\rho^{2}}{\\tau}\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the conductivities by taking the ratio of the diffusion coefficients. The symbol `~` in the problem base indicates a scaling relation, where numerical factors of order unity are omitted. Proceeding under this interpretation, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_{\\parallel}}{\\kappa_{\\perp}} = \\frac{D_{\\parallel}}{D_{\\perp}} \\sim \\frac{\\lambda^{2}/\\tau}{\\rho^{2}/\\tau} = \\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{\\rho^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThus, the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular electron heat flux, under the assumption of comparable gradient scale lengths, is given by $(\\lambda/\\rho)^{2}$.\n\nThe problem also asks to determine the scaling of this ratio with $(\\lambda/\\rho)^{2}$. Since the derived ratio is exactly $(\\lambda/\\rho)^{2}$, it scales linearly with this quantity. The expression itself is the final answer. The provided definitions are $\\lambda = v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\tau$ and $\\rho = v_{\\mathrm{th}} / \\omega_{ce}$, which gives the well-known result that the ratio scales as $(\\omega_{ce} \\tau)^2$. The problem, however, requests the answer in terms of $\\lambda$ and $\\rho$.",
