            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded in the principles of resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. Part (a) requires the derivation of the magnetic diffusion equation from fundamental electromagnetic laws under specific plasma conditions. Part (b) requires the use of this derived equation to determine the characteristic resistive diffusion time for a current sheet.\n\n**Part (a): Derivation of the Magnetic Diffusion Equation**\n\nWe begin with the three fundamental laws provided in the problem statement for a resistive MHD plasma:\n$1$. Maxwell–Faraday’s law: $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}$\n$2$. Ampère’s law (with negligible displacement current): $\\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$\n$3$. The resistive Ohm’s law: $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\left( \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right)$\n\nThe problem specifies that the plasma is static, meaning its bulk velocity is zero: $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$. Substituting this condition into Ohm's law (3) simplifies it significantly:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\left( \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{0} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right) = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ in terms of the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ and conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\mathbf{E}$ into Faraday’s law (1):\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = -\\nabla \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\mathbf{J} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the plasma is homogeneous, which implies that the scalar conductivity $\\sigma$ is uniform in space. Therefore, the term $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}$ can be treated as a constant and pulled outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left( \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J} \\right)\n$$\nNext, we use Ampère’s law (2) to replace the current density $\\mathbf{J}$. From $\\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$, we have $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}} \\left( \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right)$. Substituting this into the evolving equation for $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left( \\nabla \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right) \\right)\n$$\nSince the magnetic permeability of free space $\\mu_{0}$ is a fundamental constant, it can also be moved outside the spatial derivatives:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0} \\sigma} \\left( \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify the double curl term, we employ the vector calculus identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{A}$. Applying this identity to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the magnetic field is solenoidal, which is a fundamental property expressed by the Gauss's law for magnetism, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. Using this condition, the vector identity simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla(0) - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{B} = - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our equation for $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0} \\sigma} \\left( - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{B} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0} \\sigma} \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nFinally, we use the given definition for the magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta \\equiv (\\mu_{0} \\sigma)^{-1}$. This yields the desired magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for part (a). This equation describes how the magnetic field diffuses through a stationary, resistive conductor.\n\n**Part (b): Characteristic Resistive Diffusion Time**\n\nWe now use the derived diffusion equation, $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{B}$, to determine the characteristic resistive diffusion time, $t_{\\eta}$. This is accomplished through a dimensional analysis or scaling argument based on the terms in the equation.\n\nLet $t_{\\eta}$ represent the characteristic time scale over which the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ evolves. Let $L$ represent the characteristic length scale over which $\\mathbf{B}$ varies spatially. We can approximate the derivatives by the ratio of the characteristic quantities:\n- The time derivative term, $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B}$, scales as the magnitude of the field change, $|\\delta \\mathbf{B}| \\sim |\\mathbf{B}|$, divided by the characteristic time, $t_{\\eta}$. So, $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{B} \\sim \\frac{|\\mathbf{B}|}{t_{\\eta}}$.\n- The Laplacian term, $\\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{B}$, represents second-order spatial derivatives. The operator $\\nabla^{2}$ has dimensions of $1/(\\text{length})^{2}$. Thus, this term scales as the magnitude of the field $|\\mathbf{B}|$ divided by the square of the characteristic length scale $L$. So, $\\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{B} \\sim \\frac{|\\mathbf{B}|}{L^{2}}$.\n\nSubstituting these scaling relations into the diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\mathbf{B}|}{t_{\\eta}} \\sim \\eta \\left( \\frac{|\\mathbf{B}|}{L^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field, $|\\mathbf{B}|$, appears on both sides and can be canceled, assuming it is non-zero. This leaves a relationship between the characteristic scales:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t_{\\eta}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{L^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional current sheet where the dominant spatial variation occurs over a scale corresponding to the sheet's half-thickness, $a$. Therefore, the characteristic length scale is $L=a$. Substituting this into our scaling relation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t_{\\eta}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{a^{2}}\n$$\nSolving for the characteristic diffusion time $t_{\\eta}$, we find:\n$$\nt_{\\eta} \\sim \\frac{a^{2}}{\\eta}\n$$\nIn the context of characteristic time scales derived from differential equations, the proportionality constant is typically taken to be of order unity. In the absence of specific boundary conditions or a full solution for a particular mode, the expression $\\frac{a^{2}}{\\eta}$ is the standard definition of the resistive diffusion time. The problem asks for a single closed-form analytic expression, which is precisely this result. Although the problem mentions expressing the time in seconds, since no numerical values are provided for $a$ or $\\eta$, the answer must remain in its symbolic, analytic form. If $a$ were given in meters and $\\eta$ in meters-squared per second, the resulting $t_{\\eta}$ would be in seconds.\n\nThe characteristic resistive diffusion time across the current sheet is therefore:\n$$\nt_{\\eta} = \\frac{a^{2}}{\\eta}\n$$",

The parameter $\\Delta'$ from the outer ideal solution drives the instability.\n\nThe standard scaling laws for the growth rate $\\gamma$ and the inner layer width $\\delta$ in the constant-$\\psi$ regime are derived from the linearized resistive MHD equations. We will utilize the established scaling for $\\delta$. The scaling of the layer width is found by balancing terms in the governing equations, leading to a relation that connects $\\delta$ to the instability drive $\\Delta'$, the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_m$, and the local magnetic shear.\n\nThe scaling for $\\delta$ is:\n$$ \\delta \\propto (\\Delta')^{1/5} \\eta_m^{2/5} \\left( \\frac{k B_y'(0)}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}} \\right)^{-2/5} $$\nTo express this in terms of the given parameters $a$ and $S$, we must relate $k$, $B_y'(0)$, and $\\eta_m$ to them.\n-   The magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_m$ is related to the Lundquist number $S$ by its definition, $S = a v_A / \\eta_m$, which gives $\\eta_m = a v_A / S$.\n-   A characteristic scale for the magnetic field gradient is $B_y'(0) \\approx B_0/a$, where $B_0$ is the characteristic magnetic field far from the sheet and $a$ is the sheet's half-thickness.\n-   The most unstable tearing modes typically have a wavenumber $k$ on the order of the inverse of the macroscopic scale, so we take $k \\approx 1/a$.\n\nSubstituting these relationships into the scaling for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\frac{k B_y'(0)}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}} \\approx \\frac{1/a \\cdot B_0/a}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}} = \\frac{B_0/\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}{a^2} = \\frac{v_A}{a^2} $$\nNow, substituting for all terms in the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta \\propto (\\Delta')^{1/5} \\left( \\frac{a v_A}{S} \\right)^{2/5} \\left( \\frac{v_A}{a^2} \\right)^{-2/5} $$\nLet's collect the powers of the various terms:\n$$ \\delta \\propto (\\Delta')^{1/5} (a v_A)^{2/5} S^{-2/5} (v_A)^{-2/5} (a^2)^{2/5} $$\n$$ \\delta \\propto (\\Delta')^{1/5} a^{2/5} v_A^{2/5} S^{-2/5} v_A^{-2/5} a^{4/5} $$\n$$ \\delta \\propto (\\Delta')^{1/5} a^{6/5} S^{-2/5} $$\nIt is conventional to work with the dimensionless stability parameter $\\Delta' a$. We can rewrite the expression as:\n$$ \\delta \\propto (\\Delta' a)^{1/5} a^{-1/5} a^{6/5} S^{-2/5} = (\\Delta' a)^{1/5} a S^{-2/5} $$\nAssuming the constant of proportionality is unity for this scaling analysis, we have:\n$$ \\delta = a S^{-2/5} (\\Delta' a)^{1/5} $$\n\n**Step 1.2: Grid Spacing vs. Inner-Layer Width**\nThe problem requires that the relative error in the amplitude of the numerical Laplacian be bounded by $\\varepsilon$. The continuum Laplacian operator in Fourier space is multiplication by $-q^2$. The finite-difference operator symbol is $\\hat{L}(q) = -\\frac{4}{\\Delta x^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{q \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe relative error $E_r$ is:\n$$ E_r = \\left| \\frac{\\hat{L}(q) - (-q^2)}{-q^2} \\right| = \\left| 1 - \\frac{4}{(q \\Delta x)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{q \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\right| $$\nThe characteristic wavenumber of the inner layer is $q \\sim 1/\\delta$. To resolve the layer, we require $\\Delta x \\ll \\delta$, which means the argument of the sine function, $z \\equiv \\frac{q \\Delta x}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\delta}$, is small. We can Taylor expand $\\sin(z) \\approx z - z^3/6 + \\dots$\n$$ E_r = \\left| 1 - \\frac{1}{z^2} \\left( z - \\frac{z^3}{6} + O(z^5) \\right)^2 \\right| = \\left| 1 - \\frac{1}{z^2} \\left( z^2 - \\frac{z^4}{3} + O(z^6) \\right) \\right| $$\n$$ E_r = \\left| 1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{z^2}{3} + O(z^4) \\right) \\right| \\approx \\frac{z^2}{3} $$\nSubstituting back $z = \\Delta x / (2\\delta)$:\n$$ E_r \\approx \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta x}{2\\delta} \\right)^2 = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{12 \\delta^2} $$\nThe condition $E_r \\le \\varepsilon$ imposes a constraint on the maximum allowed grid spacing $\\Delta x$:\n$$ \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{12 \\delta^2} \\le \\varepsilon \\implies \\Delta x \\le \\sqrt{12\\varepsilon} \\delta = 2\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon} \\delta $$\nThe problem defines the maximum allowed grid spacing as $\\Delta x_{\\min}$. Thus:\n$$ \\Delta x_{\\min} = 2\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon} \\delta $$\n\n**Step 1.3: Final Expression for $\\Delta x_{\\min}$**\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta$ from Step 1.1 into the result from Step 1.2:\n$$ \\Delta x_{\\min} = 2\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon} \\left( a S^{-2/5} (\\Delta' a)^{1/5} \\right) $$\nThis expression gives the maximum grid spacing that ensures the numerical discretization of the Laplacian term, which governs resistivity in the inner layer, is accurate to a relative error $\\varepsilon$. Since $a$ has units of length (meters are specified in the prompt as the desired unit) and all other parameters ($S$, $\\Delta'a$, $\\varepsilon$) are dimensionless, the resulting $\\Delta x_{\\min}$ will have units of length.\n\n**Part 2: Bias in Growth Rate due to Under-resolution**\n\nUnder-resolution means the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ is larger than the maximum allowed value, $\\Delta x  \\Delta x_{\\min}$. This implies that the parameter $z = \\Delta x / (2\\delta)$ is not small, and the numerical Laplacian significantly deviates from the continuum one.\n\nThe numerical scheme effectively replaces the physical magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_m$ with a numerically modified one, $\\eta_{m, \\text{num}}$. The diffusion term is $\\eta_m \\nabla^2 \\psi$, which in Fourier space is $-\\eta_m q^2 \\psi$. The numerical counterpart is $\\eta_m \\hat{L}(q) \\psi$. The effective numerical diffusivity is therefore:\n$$ \\eta_{m, \\text{num}} = \\eta_m \\frac{|\\hat{L}(q)|}{q^2} = \\eta_m \\frac{4}{(q \\Delta x)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{q \\Delta x}{2}\\right) $$\nFor any non-zero $q \\Delta x$, the term $\\frac{4}{(q\\Delta x)^2} \\sin^2(\\frac{q \\Delta x}{2})$ is strictly less than $1$. Therefore, under-resolution always leads to an effective magnetic diffusivity that is smaller than the physical one: $\\eta_{m, \\text{num}}  \\eta_m$.\n\nThe growth rate of the constant-$\\psi$ tearing mode scales with resistivity as $\\gamma \\propto \\eta_m^{3/5}$. The numerically measured growth rate, $\\gamma_{\\text{num}}$, will therefore scale with the effective numerical diffusivity:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{num}} \\propto (\\eta_{m, \\text{num}})^{3/5} $$\nThe ratio of the numerical to the continuum growth rate is:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{num}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{cont}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{m, \\text{num}}}{\\eta_m}\\right)^{3/5} = \\left( \\frac{4}{(q\\Delta x)^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{q \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\right)^{3/5} $$\nSince the base is less than $1$, we have $\\gamma_{\\text{num}}  \\gamma_{\\text{cont}}$. Thus, under-resolution causes the tearing mode growth rate to be systematically underestimated.\n\nFor a leading-order calculation of this bias when the resolution is marginally insufficient (i.e., $\\Delta x / \\delta$ is small but non-negligible), we use the Taylor expansion derived previously:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta_{m, \\text{num}}}{\\eta_m} \\approx 1 - \\frac{(q\\Delta x)^2}{12} = 1 - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{12\\delta^2} $$\nThe growth rate ratio becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{num}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{cont}}} \\approx \\left( 1 - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{12\\delta^2} \\right)^{3/5} $$\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1-u)^n \\approx 1-nu$ for small $u$:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{num}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{cont}}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{12\\delta^2} = 1 - \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{20\\delta^2} $$\nThis leading-order calculation confirms that the numerical growth rate is lower than the continuum value, and the relative error in the growth rate, $(\\gamma_{\\text{cont}} - \\gamma_{\\text{num}})/\\gamma_{\\text{cont}}$, is proportional to $(\\Delta x/\\delta)^2$.",
