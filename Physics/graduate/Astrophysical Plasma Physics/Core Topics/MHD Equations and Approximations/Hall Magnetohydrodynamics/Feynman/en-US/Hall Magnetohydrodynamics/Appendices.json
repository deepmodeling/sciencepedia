A determination of the base SI units for the Hall coefficient $\\eta_{H}$ based on dimensional consistency.\n\nLet $[Q]$ denote the physical dimension of a quantity $Q$.

The full equation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{1}{ne} (\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{1}{ne} \\nabla P_e + \\frac{m_e}{ne^2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial t} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the bulk fluid velocity, $\\eta$ is the resistivity, $n$ is the electron number density, $e$ is the elementary charge, $P_e$ is the electron pressure, and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n\nWe apply the simplifying assumptions given in the problem statement:\n1.  The ions are locked into a rigid lattice, so their bulk velocity is zero. The bulk fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is a mass-weighted average of ion and electron velocities. Since the electron mass is negligible compared to the ion mass, the bulk velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is effectively the ion velocity, which is given as negligible.

The problem is framed within HMHD, neglecting electron pressure gradients, electron inertia, and compressibility, and assuming a quasi-neutral plasma with uniform ion density $n$, uniform scalar resistivity $\\eta$, and negligible displacement current.\n\nThe fundamental laws we begin with are:\n1.  **Faraday's Law of Induction**:\n    $$\n    \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n    where $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\n2.  **Generalized Ohm's Law**: In its full form, this law relates the electric field to currents and fluid motions.

This allows us to express $\\mathbf{J}$ as $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$.\n\nTo compare the relevant physical effects, we derive the magnetic induction equation.

The terms on the right-hand side represent, respectively, the advection of the magnetic field with the bulk plasma flow, the Hall effect, and resistive diffusion.\n\nThe problem asks to consider the breakdown of \"electron frozen-in\" due to resistivity. The magnetic field is frozen into the electron fluid when the advection of the field with the electron velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_e$, dominates over resistive diffusion. The electron fluid velocity is given by $\\mathbf{v}_e = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{J}/(ne)$.

The breakdown of the electron frozen-in condition occurs when these two terms become comparable in magnitude.\n\nThe problem asks to compare the \"Hall advection contribution\" and the resistive diffusion. In the context of a planar current sheet, it is standard to analyze the central region where the magnetic field reverses and gradients are strongest. In this region, the bulk plasma inflow velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ can be considered negligible ($\\mathbf{v} \\approx 0$). In this case, the electron velocity is dominated by the current drift: $\\mathbf{v}_e \\approx -\\mathbf{J}/(ne)$. The electron-frame advection term becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v}_e \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\approx \\nabla \\times \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{ne} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{ne} \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nThis is precisely the Hall term (up to a sign, depending on convention). Thus, under the reasonable assumption of negligible bulk flow at the sheet's center, the problem reduces to comparing the magnitude of the Hall term with the resistive diffusion term.\n\nThe threshold condition is therefore:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J})| \\sim \\left|\\frac{1}{ne} \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{J})\\right|\n$$\nSince $\\eta$, $n$, and $e$ are given as uniform constants, they can be taken outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\eta |\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}| \\sim \\frac{1}{ne} |\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{J})|\n$$\nWe now perform a scale analysis for the planar current sheet of characteristic half-thickness $\\delta$. The magnetic field of magnitude $B$ reverses over this scale.\n-   The gradient operator scales as $|\\nabla| \\sim 1/\\delta$.\n-   From Ampere's Law, the current density $J$ required to support this field change is $J = |\\mathbf{J}| \\sim \\frac{|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}|}{\\mu_0} \\sim \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta}$.\n-   In the current sheet geometry, the current $\\mathbf{J}$ is largely perpendicular to the reversing magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, so $|\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{J}| \\sim BJ$.\n\nLet's scale the two terms in our threshold condition:\n-   **Resistive diffusion term scale**:\n    $$\n    \\eta |\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}| \\sim \\eta \\frac{J}{\\delta} \\sim \\eta \\frac{B/\\mu_0\\delta}{\\delta} = \\frac{\\eta B}{\\mu_0 \\delta^2}\n    $$\n-   **Hall term scale**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{ne} |\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{J})| \\sim \\frac{1}{ne} \\frac{|\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{J}|}{\\delta} \\sim \\frac{1}{ne\\delta} (BJ) \\sim \\frac{1}{ne\\delta} B \\left(\\frac{B}{\\mu_0 \\delta}\\right) = \\frac{B^2}{ne\\mu_0 \\delta^2}\n    $$\nThe threshold condition is met when these scales are equal. Let $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ be the magnetic field magnitude at this threshold:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta B_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\mu_0 \\delta^2} = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{crit}}^2}{ne\\mu_0 \\delta^2}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial solution where $B_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\neq 0$, we can cancel common factors of $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, $\\mu_0$, and $\\delta^2$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{ne}\n$$\nSolving for the critical magnetic field $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{crit}} = n e \\eta\n$$\nThis result gives the magnetic field strength at which the Hall effect and resistive diffusion are of comparable importance in the dynamics of the magnetic field evolution within the current sheet. For fields stronger than $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the Hall effect dominates, while for fields weaker than $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, resistive diffusion is the more significant mechanism for breaking the frozen-in condition. The problem asks for the result in SI units, and as the derivation was performed using fundamental equations in their SI form (including $\\mu_0$), the resulting expression is inherently in SI units, yielding $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ in tesla provided $n$, $e$, and $\\eta$ are in their respective SI units ($m^{-3}$, $C$, and $\\Omega \\cdot m$).",
