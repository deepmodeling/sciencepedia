This practice goes to the heart of this assumption by asking you to derive the timescales for two competing processes: the advection of the magnetic field with the plasma flow and the diffusion of the field due to resistivity. By calculating their ratio, the magnetic Reynolds number $R_m$, for a typical astrophysical scenario, you will gain a quantitative understanding of why the ideal MHD model is so remarkably successful for describing large-scale cosmic plasmas .",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of characteristic timescales for magnetic advection and diffusion from the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) induction equation, followed by a calculation for a specific astrophysical scenario.\n\nFirst, we derive the induction equation. The starting point is the Maxwell-Faraday law of induction:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\nFor a conducting fluid (plasma), the electric field in the fluid's rest frame is related to the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ by Ohm's law. For a simple collisional plasma with a scalar, uniform electrical conductivity $\\sigma$, the generalized Ohm's law is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}$ is the bulk flow velocity of the plasma. We can rearrange this to express the electric field as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma} - \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe first term, $\\mathbf{J}/\\sigma$, represents resistive effects, while the second term, $-\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, is the motional electric field induced by the plasma moving through the magnetic field.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mathbf{E}$ into the Faraday law gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{J}}{\\sigma} - \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nIn the low-frequency limit characteristic of MHD, the displacement current is neglected in Ampere's law, which becomes $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$, where $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. We can therefore write the current density as $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$. Substituting this into our evolving equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right)\n$$\nWe define the magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta$, as $\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma}$. The problem states $\\eta$ is uniform. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\eta \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$ on the second term, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\eta \\left[ \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} \\right]\n$$\nA fundamental constraint from Maxwell's equations is Gauss's law for magnetism, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. Applying this constraint simplifies the equation to the final form of the induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\underbrace{\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})}_{\\text{Advection/Induction}} + \\underbrace{\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}}_{\\text{Diffusion/Resistivity}}\n$$\nThis equation describes how the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ evolves in time due to two competing processes: advection with the plasma flow and diffusion through the plasma.\n\nNext, we use dimensional reasoning to find the characteristic timescales. Let $L$ be a characteristic length scale, $U$ be a characteristic flow speed, and $B_0$ be a characteristic magnetic field strength. The operators can be approximated by their characteristic scales: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{1}{t}$, $\\nabla \\sim \\frac{1}{L}$, and $\\nabla^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{L^2}$.\n\nThe terms in the induction equation have the following characteristic magnitudes:\n-   Rate of change: $|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}| \\sim \\frac{B_0}{t}$\n-   Advection term: $|\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})| \\sim \\frac{1}{L} U B_0 = \\frac{U B_0}{L}$\n-   Diffusion term: $|\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}| \\sim \\eta \\frac{B_0}{L^2}$\n\nThe characteristic advection timescale, $t_{\\mathrm{adv}}$, is the time over which the magnetic field changes significantly due to advection. We find it by balancing the rate of change term with the advection term:\n$$\n\\frac{B_0}{t_{\\mathrm{adv}}} \\sim \\frac{U B_0}{L} \\implies t_{\\mathrm{adv}} = \\frac{L}{U}\n$$\nThe characteristic diffusion timescale, $t_{\\eta}$, is the time over which the field changes significantly due to diffusion. We find it by balancing the rate of change term with the diffusion term:\n$$\n\\frac{B_0}{t_{\\eta}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta B_0}{L^2} \\implies t_{\\eta} = \\frac{L^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R} \\equiv t_{\\eta}/t_{\\mathrm{adv}}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{t_{\\eta}}{t_{\\mathrm{adv}}} = \\frac{L^2/\\eta}{L/U} = \\frac{LU}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis dimensionless number is known as the magnetic Reynolds number, $R_m$.\n\nWe are given the following parameters for a coronal loop:\n$L = 7.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$U = 1.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\eta = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{(7.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (1.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = (7.0 \\times 1.5) \\times 10^{(7+5)} = 10.5 \\times 10^{12} = 1.05 \\times 10^{13}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The result $1.05 \\times 10^{13}$ is already in this form.\n\nRegarding the divergence-free constraint, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, its evolution is governed by taking the divergence of the induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla \\cdot [\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})] + \\nabla \\cdot [\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}]\n$$\nThe divergence of any curl is identically zero, so $\\nabla \\cdot [\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})] = 0$. Assuming uniform $\\eta$, the divergence and Laplacian operators commute, so $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla^2(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$. This yields a diffusion equation for $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) = \\eta \\nabla^2(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nIf $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ initially everywhere, this equation ensures it remains zero for all time. In the ideal limit, $\\eta \\to 0$, we have $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) = 0$. This means that if the magnetic field is initially divergence-free, it will remain so for all time under the evolution of the ideal MHD equations. This property is known as the solenoidal constraint.\n\nFinally, the value of $\\mathcal{R}$ informs the applicability of ideal MHD. The ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ compares the magnitude of the advection term to the diffusion term:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\text{Advection term}|}{|\\text{Diffusion term}|} \\sim \\frac{U B_0 / L}{\\eta B_0 / L^2} = \\frac{UL}{\\eta} = \\mathcal{R}\n$$\n-   If $\\mathcal{R} \\gg 1$, the advection term dominates over the diffusion term. The magnetic field lines are effectively \"frozen-in\" to the plasma and are transported with the flow. The resistive diffusion term is negligible. In this regime, the ideal MHD approximation ($\\eta = 0$) is excellent.\n-   If $\\mathcal{R} \\ll 1$, diffusion dominates, and the magnetic field slips through the plasma. Resistive effects are crucial, and ideal MHD is invalid.\n\nOur calculated value is $\\mathcal{R} = 1.05 \\times 10^{13}$, which is vastly greater than $1$. This signifies that for the large-scale dynamics of the specified coronal loop, magnetic advection is overwhelmingly dominant, by a factor of about ten trillion. Therefore, except for regions with extremely small length scales (e.g., intense current sheets where $L$ becomes very small), the ideal MHD model is a highly accurate description of the plasma physics.",
