This principle, known as quasineutrality, allows us to model plasmas as single conducting fluids rather than tracking individual charged particles. This exercise challenges you to quantify the limits of this crucial approximation by starting from Gauss's law and the electron fluid momentum balance. By deriving the fractional charge separation, you will see how it depends on the ratio of the Debye length to the characteristic scale of the plasma, providing a concrete understanding of when and why the quasineutrality assumption holds .",

            "solution": "The problem is to derive and evaluate the fractional departure from quasineutrality, $\\delta$, in a weakly ionized hydrogen plasma under specific approximations. The derivation will start from the provided fundamental equations: Gauss's law and the steady-state electron force balance.\n\nThe given equations are:\n1.  Gauss's Law for the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$$\n    where $\\rho$ is the net charge density and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\n2.  The steady-state electron force balance equation, which indicates that the electric force on the electrons is balanced by the pressure gradient force:\n    $$-e n_{e} \\boldsymbol{E} - \\nabla p_{e} = \\boldsymbol{0}$$\n    where $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, and $p_{e}$ is the electron pressure.\n3.  The electron pressure is given by the ideal gas law for an isothermal fluid at temperature $T_{e}$:\n    $$p_{e} = n_{e} k_{B} T_{e}$$\n    where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$. From the force balance equation, we have:\n$$-e n_{e} \\boldsymbol{E} = \\nabla p_{e}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{e}$ and noting that $T_{e}$ is constant (isothermal), we get:\n$$-e n_{e} \\boldsymbol{E} = \\nabla (n_{e} k_{B} T_{e}) = k_{B} T_{e} \\nabla n_{e}$$\nSolving for $\\boldsymbol{E}$ gives:\n$$\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{e n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e}$$\nThis electric field is the ambipolar electric field, which arises due to the pressure gradient in the electron fluid.\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{E}$ into Gauss's law. Taking the divergence of $\\boldsymbol{E}$:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{e n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$$\nThe charge density $\\rho$ for a singly ionized hydrogen plasma (composed of electrons with charge $-e$ and ions (protons) with charge $+e$) is given by:\n$$\\rho = e n_{i} - e n_{e} = e(n_{i} - n_{e})$$\nwhere $n_{i}$ is the ion number density.\n\nSubstituting for $\\rho$ and rearranging the equation, we get:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{e n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right) = \\frac{e(n_{i} - n_{e})}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$$\nWe can solve for the difference in number densities, $(n_{i} - n_{e})$:\n$$n_{i} - n_{e} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{e^{2}} \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right)$$\nSince $k_{B}$ and $T_{e}$ are constants, they can be moved outside the divergence operator:\n$$n_{i} - n_{e} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} k_{B} T_{e}}{e^{2}} \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right)$$\nThe fractional departure from quasineutrality is defined as $\\delta \\equiv \\frac{|n_{i} - n_{e}|}{n_{e}}$. Dividing the above equation by $n_{e}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{n_{i} - n_{e}}{n_{e}} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} k_{B} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}} \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right)$$\nWe recognize the term $\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} k_{B} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}$ as the square of the electron Debye length, $\\lambda_{D}^{2}$. The definition is:\n$$\\lambda_{D} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} k_{B} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}}$$\nThe term in the divergence can be rewritten using the identity $\\nabla(\\ln n_{e}) = \\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e}$. Thus, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e}) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\ln n_{e}) = \\nabla^{2} (\\ln n_{e})$.\nSo, the exact expression for the fractional charge imbalance is:\n$$\\frac{n_{i} - n_{e}}{n_{e}} = -\\lambda_{D}^{2} \\nabla^{2} (\\ln n_{e})$$\nThe problem asks for an order-of-magnitude expression. We use the given characteristic scale length for density variations, $L_{n}$, defined by $|\\nabla \\ln n_{e}| \\sim L_{n}^{-1}$. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^{2}$ has a characteristic magnitude of $L_{n}^{-2}$. Specifically, $|\\nabla^{2}(\\ln n_{e})| \\sim |\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\ln n_{e})| \\sim \\frac{1}{L_{n}} |\\nabla \\ln n_{e}| \\sim \\frac{1}{L_{n}} \\left(\\frac{1}{L_{n}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L_{n}^{2}}$.\nTaking the magnitude of the fractional imbalance, we find the order-of-magnitude estimate for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{|n_{i} - n_{e}|}{n_{e}} \\sim \\lambda_{D}^{2} \\frac{1}{L_{n}^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{D}}{L_{n}}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for $\\delta$.\n\nFor the second part, we evaluate $\\delta$ numerically.

This condition confirms that the plasma can have a quasineutral interior, validating the physical setup.\n\nNow, we compute $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{D}}{L_{n}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{35.6326\\ \\mathrm{m}}{3.085677581 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$\\delta = (1.15477 \\times 10^{-15})^{2} \\approx 1.33349 \\times 10^{-30}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fractional departure from quasineutrality is:\n$$\\delta \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-30}$$\nThis extremely small value illustrates that for macroscopic systems with large density scale lengths, the quasineutrality approximation ($n_{i} \\approx n_{e}$) is exceptionally accurate.",

The Rotation Measure (RM) is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{RM} = \\frac{e^3}{8\\pi^2 c^3 m_e^2 \\epsilon_0} \\int_0^D n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds$$\n\nFor astrophysical calculations, it is standard to use a numerical prefactor such that if $n_e$ is in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $B_\\parallel$ is in $\\mu\\mathrm{G}$, and the path length $s$ is in parsecs (pc), the RM is given in $\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{RM} [\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}] \\approx 0.8115 \\int_0^D n_e(s)[\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]\\,B_\\parallel(s)[\\mu\\mathrm{G}]\\,ds[\\mathrm{pc}]$$\nThe integral $\\mathcal{I} = \\int_0^{2200} n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds$ is split into three segments: $\\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{I}_A + \\mathcal{I}_B + \\mathcal{I}_C$.\n\nSegment A ($0 \\le s < 600\\,\\mathrm{pc}$):\nThe integral of the cosine term over two full periods ($s=0$ to $s=600$) is zero.\n$$\\mathcal{I}_A = \\int_0^{600} \\left[0.030 + 0.015 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi s}{300}\\right)\\right] (1.5) ds = 1.5 \\times 0.030 \\times 600 = 27\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\mu G\\,pc}$$\n\nSegment B ($600 \\le s < 1700\\,\\mathrm{pc}$):\nThe integral is split into a constant density part and a Gaussian part.\nPart 1 (constant): $2.0 \\int_{600}^{1700} 0.045 ds = 2.0 \\times 0.045 \\times (1700-600) = 99$.\nPart 2 (Gaussian): $2.0 \\times 0.18 \\int_{600}^{1700} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-1150)^2}{2(200)^2}\\right) ds$.\nThe integral of a Gaussian $\\exp(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2})$ is $\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma \\cdot \\mathrm{erf}(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma})$. For our integral with $\\mu=1150, \\sigma=200$, the value is approximately $0.36 \\times \\sqrt{2\\pi}(200) \\times \\text{erf}(\\frac{1700-1150}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 200}) = 0.36 \\times 501.32 \\times 0.99388 \\approx 179.37$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{I}_B = 99 + 179.37 = 278.37\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\mu G\\,pc}$.\n\nSegment C ($1700 \\le s \\le 2200\\,\\mathrm{pc}$):\n$$\\mathcal{I}_C = \\int_{1700}^{2200} (0.025) (-1.2) ds = -0.03 \\times (2200-1700) = -15\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\mu G\\,pc}$$\n\nTotal integral:\n$$\\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{I}_A + \\mathcal{I}_B + \\mathcal{I}_C = 27 + 278.37 - 15 = 290.37\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\mu G\\,pc}$$\n\nFinal RM value:\n$$\\mathrm{RM} = 0.8115 \\times \\mathcal{I} = 0.8115 \\times 290.37 \\approx 235.645\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $236\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$.\nThe consistency assessment shows that the calculated value of $236\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$ is in excellent agreement with the observed value of $230 \\pm 10\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$.",
