            "solution": "The problem is to derive and evaluate the fractional departure from quasineutrality, $\\delta$, in a weakly ionized hydrogen plasma under specific approximations. The derivation will start from the provided fundamental equations: Gauss's law and the steady-state electron force balance.\n\nThe given equations are:\n1.  Gauss's Law for the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$$\n    where $\\rho$ is the net charge density and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space.\n2.  The steady-state electron force balance equation, which indicates that the electric force on the electrons is balanced by the pressure gradient force:\n    $$-e n_{e} \\boldsymbol{E} - \\nabla p_{e} = \\boldsymbol{0}$$\n    where $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, and $p_{e}$ is the electron pressure.\n3.  The electron pressure is given by the ideal gas law for an isothermal fluid at temperature $T_{e}$:\n    $$p_{e} = n_{e} k_{B} T_{e}$$\n    where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$. From the force balance equation, we have:\n$$-e n_{e} \\boldsymbol{E} = \\nabla p_{e}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{e}$ and noting that $T_{e}$ is constant (isothermal), we get:\n$$-e n_{e} \\boldsymbol{E} = \\nabla (n_{e} k_{B} T_{e}) = k_{B} T_{e} \\nabla n_{e}$$\nSolving for $\\boldsymbol{E}$ gives:\n$$\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{e n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e}$$\nThis electric field is the ambipolar electric field, which arises due to the pressure gradient in the electron fluid.\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{E}$ into Gauss's law. Taking the divergence of $\\boldsymbol{E}$:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{E} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{e n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$$\nThe charge density $\\rho$ for a singly ionized hydrogen plasma (composed of electrons with charge $-e$ and ions (protons) with charge $+e$) is given by:\n$$\\rho = e n_{i} - e n_{e} = e(n_{i} - n_{e})$$\nwhere $n_{i}$ is the ion number density.\n\nSubstituting for $\\rho$ and rearranging the equation, we get:\n$$\\nabla \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{e n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right) = \\frac{e(n_{i} - n_{e})}{\\varepsilon_{0}}$$\nWe can solve for the difference in number densities, $(n_{i} - n_{e})$:\n$$n_{i} - n_{e} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{e^{2}} \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k_{B} T_{e}}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right)$$\nSince $k_{B}$ and $T_{e}$ are constants, they can be moved outside the divergence operator:\n$$n_{i} - n_{e} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} k_{B} T_{e}}{e^{2}} \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e} \\right)$$\nThe fractional departure from quasineutrality is defined as $\\delta \\equiv \\frac{|n_{i} - n_{e}|}{n_{e}}$.

The definition is:\n$$\\lambda_{D} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0} k_{B} T_{e}}{n_{e} e^{2}}}$$\nThe term in the divergence can be rewritten using the identity $\\nabla(\\ln n_{e}) = \\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e}$. Thus, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\frac{1}{n_{e}} \\nabla n_{e}) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\ln n_{e}) = \\nabla^{2} (\\ln n_{e})$.\nSo, the exact expression for the fractional charge imbalance is:\n$$\\frac{n_{i} - n_{e}}{n_{e}} = -\\lambda_{D}^{2} \\nabla^{2} (\\ln n_{e})$$\nThe problem asks for an order-of-magnitude expression. We use the given characteristic scale length for density variations, $L_{n}$, defined by $|\\nabla \\ln n_{e}| \\sim L_n^{-1}$. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^{2}$ has a characteristic magnitude of $L_n^{-2}$. Specifically, we can estimate the magnitude as $|\\nabla^{2}(\\ln n_{e})| \\sim |\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\ln n_{e})| \\sim \\frac{1}{L_n} |\\nabla \\ln n_{e}| \\sim \\frac{1}{L_n} \\left(\\frac{1}{L_n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L_n^2}$.\nTaking the magnitude of the fractional imbalance, we find the order-of-magnitude estimate for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{|n_{i} - n_{e}|}{n_{e}} \\sim \\lambda_{D}^{2} \\frac{1}{L_{n}^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{D}}{L_{n}}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for $\\delta$.\n\nFor the second part, we evaluate $\\delta$ numerically.

This condition confirms that the plasma can have a quasineutral interior, validating the physical setup.\n\nNow, we compute $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{D}}{L_{n}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{35.6326\\ \\mathrm{m}}{3.085677581 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$\\delta = (1.15477 \\times 10^{-15})^{2} \\approx 1.33349 \\times 10^{-30}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fractional departure from quasineutrality is:\n$$\\delta \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-30}$$\nThis extremely small value illustrates that for macroscopic systems with large density scale lengths, the quasineutrality approximation ($n_{i} \\approx n_{e}$) is exceptionally accurate.",

The angle of rotation $\\psi$ after propagating a distance $D$ is half the total phase difference between the L and R modes:\n$$\\psi = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi_L - \\phi_R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^D (k_L(s) - k_R(s)) ds = \\frac{\\omega}{2c} \\int_0^D (n_L(s) - n_R(s)) ds$$\nThe difference in refractive indices is:\n$$n_L - n_R = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{2\\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega_p^2 |\\Omega_e|}{2\\omega^3}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{2\\omega^2} - \\frac{\\omega_p^2 |\\Omega_e|}{2\\omega^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\omega_p^2 |\\Omega_e|}{\\omega^3}$$\nThe rotation angle depends on the sign of the line-of-sight magnetic field, $B_\\parallel$. By convention, positive rotation is for a field pointing towards the observer. We can explicitly include the sign by writing $|\\Omega_e| = e |B_\\parallel|/m_e$ and noting that the sign of the effect is carried by $B_\\parallel$. The fundamental expression for the phase difference properly handles this, leading to:\n$$\\psi = \\frac{1}{2c\\omega^2} \\int_0^D \\frac{e B_\\parallel(s)}{m_e} \\omega_p^2(s) ds$$\nSubstituting $\\omega_p^2 = n_e e^2 / (m_e \\epsilon_0)$:\n$$\\psi = \\frac{1}{2c\\omega^2} \\int_0^D \\frac{e B_\\parallel}{m_e} \\frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0} ds = \\frac{e^3}{2c m_e^2 \\epsilon_0 \\omega^2} \\int_0^D n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds$$\nThe problem asks for the dependence on wavelength $\\lambda$. Using $\\omega = 2\\pi c / \\lambda$, we get $\\omega^2 = 4\\pi^2 c^2 / \\lambda^2$:\n$$\\psi = \\frac{e^3}{2c m_e^2 \\epsilon_0 (4\\pi^2 c^2 / \\lambda^2)} \\int_0^D n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds = \\left( \\frac{e^3}{8\\pi^2 c^3 m_e^2 \\epsilon_0} \\int_0^D n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds \\right) \\lambda^2$$\nThis is of the form $\\psi = (\\mathrm{RM}) \\lambda^2$. The Rotation Measure (RM) is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{RM} = \\frac{e^3}{8\\pi^2 c^3 m_e^2 \\epsilon_0} \\int_0^D n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds$$\nThis is the desired expression.\n\n**Calculation of the Rotation Measure**\n\nTo calculate the RM, we first evaluate the constant prefactor and then the integral. A common convention expresses the RM as:\n$$\\mathrm{RM} \\approx 0.8115 \\int_0^D n_e(s)[\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]\\,B_\\parallel(s)[\\mu\\mathrm{G}]\\,ds[\\mathrm{pc}]$$\nThe integral $\\mathcal{I} = \\int_0^{2200} n_e(s) B_\\parallel(s) ds$ is split into three segments: $\\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{I}_A + \\mathcal{I}_B + \\mathcal{I}_C$.\n\nSegment A ($0 \\le s < 600\\,\\mathrm{pc}$):\n$$\\mathcal{I}_A = \\int_0^{600} \\left[0.030 + 0.015 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi s}{300}\\right)\\right] (1.5) ds$$\n$$= 1.5 \\left[ 0.030 s + 0.015 \\frac{300}{2\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi s}{300}\\right) \\right]_0^{600}$$\n$$= 1.5 \\left[ \\left(0.030 \\times 600 + \\frac{2.25}{\\pi}\\sin(4\\pi)\\right) - (0) \\right] = 1.5 \\times 18 = 27\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\,\\mu G\\,pc}$$\n\nSegment B ($600 \\le s < 1700\\,\\mathrm{pc}$):\n$$\\mathcal{I}_B = \\int_{600}^{1700} \\left[ 0.045 + 0.18 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-1150)^2}{2(200)^2}\\right) \\right] (2.0) ds$$\nThe integral is split into two parts:\nPart 1 (constant density): $2.0 \\int_{600}^{1700} 0.045 ds = 2.0 \\times 0.045 \\times (1700-600) = 0.09 \\times 1100 = 99$.\nPart 2 (Gaussian): $2.0 \\times 0.18 \\int_{600}^{1700} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-1150)^2}{2(200)^2}\\right) ds$.\nThe integral of a Gaussian $\\int \\exp(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2})dx$ with $\\mu=1150\\,\\mathrm{pc}$ and $\\sigma=200\\,\\mathrm{pc}$ is approximately $\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ over its full range. The limits from $600$ to $1700\\,\\mathrm{pc}$ correspond to $\\mu \\pm 2.75\\sigma$, which captures most of the area. The integral is $\\int_{600}^{1700} \\exp(...) ds \\approx 498.25\\,\\mathrm{pc}$.\nSo, this part is $0.36 \\times 498.25 \\approx 179.37$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{I}_B = 99 + 179.37 = 278.37\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\,\\mu G\\,pc}$.\n\nSegment C ($1700 \\le s \\le 2200\\,\\mathrm{pc}$):\n$$\\mathcal{I}_C = \\int_{1700}^{2200} (0.025) (-1.2) ds = -0.03 \\int_{1700}^{2200} ds$$\n$$= -0.03 \\times (2200-1700) = -0.03 \\times 500 = -15\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\,\\mu G\\,pc}$$\n\nTotal integral:\n$$\\mathcal{I} = \\mathcal{I}_A + \\mathcal{I}_B + \\mathcal{I}_C = 27 + 278.37 - 15 = 290.37\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}\\,\\mu G\\,pc}$$\n\nFinal RM value:\n$$\\mathrm{RM} = 0.8115 \\times \\mathcal{I} = 0.8115 \\times 290.37 \\approx 235.645\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $236\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\n**Consistency Assessment**: The calculated value $\\mathrm{RM} \\approx 236\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$ is in excellent agreement with the observed value $\\mathrm{RM}_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 230 \\pm 10\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$.
