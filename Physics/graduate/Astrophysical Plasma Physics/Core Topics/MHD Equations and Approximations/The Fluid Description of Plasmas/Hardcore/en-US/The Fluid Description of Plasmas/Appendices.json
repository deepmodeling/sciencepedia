            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the resistive heating term in a plasma, its expression in terms of characteristic astrophysical parameters, and a numerical evaluation for a specific scenario. The solution is structured in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Resistive Heating Term\n\nWe begin by considering the energy balance in the plasma. The rate at which the electromagnetic field does work on the charged particles (the plasma) per unit volume is given by $\\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{E}$, where $\\vec{J}$ is the current density and $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field. This work can be partitioned into work that changes the bulk kinetic energy of the fluid and work that increases its internal (thermal) energy.\n\nThe problem states that the plasma is described by a generalized Ohm's law, which in its resistive MHD form is:\n$$\n\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} = \\eta \\vec{J}\n$$\nHere, $\\vec{v}$ is the fluid velocity, $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $\\eta$ is the scalar electrical resistivity. We can express the electric field as $\\vec{E} = \\eta \\vec{J} - \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the work done by the field, we get:\n$$\n\\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\vec{J} \\cdot (\\eta \\vec{J} - \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) = \\eta (\\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{J}) - \\vec{J} \\cdot (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})\n$$\nUsing the scalar triple product identity $\\vec{A} \\cdot (\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{C}) = \\vec{C} \\cdot (\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B})$, we can rewrite the second term:\n$$\n-\\vec{J} \\cdot (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) = - \\vec{B} \\cdot (\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{v}) = \\vec{B} \\cdot (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{J}) = \\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B})\n$$\nThe term $\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B}$ is the Lorentz force density acting on the fluid. Therefore, $\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B})$ represents the rate of work done by the Lorentz force on the bulk fluid, which contributes to the change in the fluid's kinetic energy.\n\nThe full expression for the work done by the field is thus:\n$$\n\\vec{J} \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\eta J^2 + \\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B})\n$$\nwhere $J^2 = |\\vec{J}|^2$.\n\nThe total energy imparted by the electromagnetic field to the plasma is thus split into two components. The term $\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{J} \\times \\vec{B})$ is the mechanical work that changes the kinetic energy of the plasma. The other term, which we denote as $Q_{\\eta}$, represents the energy dissipation that is not converted into ordered kinetic energy. By the first law of thermodynamics, this energy must appear as an increase in the plasma's internal energy, i.e., as heat. This process is known as Ohmic or Joule heating.\n\nThe resistive contribution to the thermal energy equation, or the volumetric Ohmic heating rate, is therefore:\n$$\nQ_{\\eta} = \\eta J^2\n$$\nTo show that this term is positive definite, we examine its components. The electrical resistivity $\\eta$ is a physical property of the medium and is non-negative ($\\eta \\ge 0$). For any real plasma, it is strictly positive ($\\eta  0$). The term $J^2 = |\\vec{J}|^2$ is the squared magnitude of the current density vector. As the square of a real vector's magnitude, it is always non-negative ($J^2 \\ge 0$). Consequently, the product $\\eta J^2$ is always greater than or equal to zero. This heating is an irreversible process, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, increasing the entropy of the system. Thus, the resistive heating term is positive definite for any current-carrying resistive plasma.\n\nPart 2: Expressing the Heating Rate in Terms of $B, \\rho, L, S$\n\nWe have the volumetric Ohmic heating rate $Q_{\\eta} = \\eta J^2$. To express this in terms of the characteristic parameters $B$ (magnetic field), $\\rho$ (mass density), $L$ (length scale), and $S$ (Lundquist number), we first relate the current density $\\vec{J}$ to the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ using Ampère's law without the displacement current:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J} \\implies \\vec{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\vec{B}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the current density is $J = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} |\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}|$. For a characteristic-scale analysis, we can approximate the curl operator as division by the characteristic length scale $L$:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}| \\sim \\frac{B}{L}\n$$\nThis gives a characteristic current density of:\n$$\nJ \\sim \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 L}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the heating rate:\n$$\nQ_{\\eta} \\sim \\eta \\left( \\frac{B}{\\mu_0 L} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\eta B^2}{\\mu_0^2 L^2}\n$$\nNext, we use the definition of the Lundquist number $S$ to express $\\eta$ in terms of the other parameters.\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\mu_0 L v_A}{\\eta} \\implies \\eta = \\frac{\\mu_0 L v_A}{S}\n$$\nThe Alfvén speed $v_A$ is defined as $v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\mu_0 L}{S} \\left( \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}} \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu_0} L B}{S \\sqrt{\\rho}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\eta$ back into our equation for $Q_{\\eta}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\eta} \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu_0} L B}{S \\sqrt{\\rho}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{B^2}{\\mu_0^2 L^2} \\right) = \\frac{B^3}{\\mu_0^{3/2} S L \\sqrt{\\rho}}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the characteristic volumetric Ohmic heating rate in terms of $B$, $\\rho$, $L$, and $S$.\n\nPart 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the volumetric Ohmic heating rate for an accretion disk corona with the following parameters:\n- $B = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n- Number density $n = 1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Characteristic length $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Lundquist number $S = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}$\n\nWe are given that the plasma is fully ionized hydrogen, so the mass density is $\\rho = m_p n$, where $m_p$ is the proton mass, $m_p \\approx 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.

The term $(i k \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) \\times B_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ simplifies to $i k B_0 \\mathbf{b}$.\nSo, the induction equation simplifies to:\n$$ -i\\omega \\mathbf{b} = i k \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\left( B_0 \\mathbf{v} - \\frac{i k B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\mathbf{b} \\right) = i k B_0 (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{v}) + \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) $$\n$$ \\omega \\mathbf{b} = k B_0 (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times (-\\mathbf{v})) - i\\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) $$\nFrom the momentum equation, we substitute $\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{k B_0}{\\omega \\rho \\mu_0} \\mathbf{b}$:\n$$ \\omega \\mathbf{b} = k B_0 \\left( \\frac{k B_0}{\\omega \\rho \\mu_0} \\mathbf{b} \\right) - i\\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) $$\n$$ \\omega \\mathbf{b} = \\frac{k^2 B_0^2}{\\omega \\rho \\mu_0} \\mathbf{b} - i\\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) $$\nUsing the Alfvén speed definition $v_A^2 = B_0^2 / (\\mu_0 \\rho)$:\n$$ \\left( \\omega - \\frac{k^2 v_A^2}{\\omega} \\right) \\mathbf{b} + i \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right) (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $\\omega$:\n$$ (\\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2) \\mathbf{b} + i \\omega \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right) (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b}) = 0 $$\nThis equation describes the polarization of the waves. To find the dispersion relation, we write it in component form. Let $\\mathbf{b} = b_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + b_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, so $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{b} = b_x \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - b_y \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\nThe system of equations for $(b_x, b_y)$ is:\n$$ (\\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2) b_x - i \\omega \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right) b_y = 0 $$\n$$ (\\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2) b_y + i \\omega \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right) b_x = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$ (\\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2)^2 - \\left[ -i \\omega \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right) \\right] \\left[ i \\omega \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right) \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ (\\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2)^2 - \\omega^2 \\left( \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} \\right)^2 = 0 $$\nThis yields two families of solutions:\n$$ \\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2 = \\pm \\omega \\frac{k^2 B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} $$\nThis is the dispersion relation for parallel-propagating transverse waves in Hall MHD. In the absence of the Hall term (the right-hand side), we recover the ideal MHD Alfvén wave dispersion relation $\\omega^2 = k^2 v_A^2$, which gives a constant phase velocity $v_{ph} = \\omega/k = v_A$.\n\nTo analyze the Hall MHD relation, we express the Hall parameter in terms of the ion inertial length $d_i = \\sqrt{m_i/(\\mu_0 n e^2)}$. We use the identity $v_A / \\Omega_i = d_i$, where $\\Omega_i = e B_0 / m_i$ is the ion cyclotron frequency.\nThe term $\\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 n e} = \\frac{B_0 m_i}{\\mu_0 (m_i n) e} = \\frac{B_0 m_i}{\\mu_0 \\rho e} = \\frac{v_A^2}{B_0} \\frac{m_i}{e} = \\frac{v_A^2}{\\Omega_i}$.\nSo the dispersion relation becomes:\n$$ \\omega^2 - k^2 v_A^2 = \\pm \\omega \\frac{k^2 v_A^2}{\\Omega_i} $$\nDividing by $k^2$ and defining the phase velocity $v_{ph} = \\omega/k$:\n$$ v_{ph}^2 - v_A^2 = \\pm \\frac{\\omega}{k} \\frac{k v_A^2}{\\Omega_i} = \\pm v_{ph} \\frac{k v_A^2}{\\Omega_i} $$\nUsing $v_A/\\Omega_i = d_i$, the term $\\frac{k v_A^2}{\\Omega_i} = k v_A (v_A/\\Omega_i) = k v_A d_i$.\n$$ v_{ph}^2 \\mp v_{ph} (k v_A d_i) - v_A^2 = 0 $$\nDividing by $v_A^2$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{v_{ph}}{v_A}\\right)^2 \\mp \\left(\\frac{v_{ph}}{v_A}\\right) (k d_i) - 1 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the normalized phase velocity $v_{ph}/v_A$. Solving for $v_{ph}/v_A$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{v_{ph}}{v_A} = \\frac{\\pm k d_i + \\sqrt{(k d_i)^2 + 4}}{2} $$\nWe consider positive frequency and phase velocity. The branch with the `$+$' sign before $k d_i$ is the right-hand circularly polarized wave, known as the whistler-polarized or fast wave branch. The branch with the `$-$' sign is the left-hand circularly polarized wave, or ion-cyclotron wave branch. The problem specifies the whistler-polarized branch:\n$$ \\frac{v_{ph}}{v_A} = \\frac{k d_i + \\sqrt{(k d_i)^2 + 4}}{2} $$\nThe condition for the transition is that the phase velocity equals twice the ideal MHD Alfvén speed, i.e., $v_{ph} = 2 v_A$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$$ 2 = \\frac{k d_i + \\sqrt{(k d_i)^2 + 4}}{2} $$\nLet $X = k d_i$.\n$$ 4 = X + \\sqrt{X^2 + 4} $$\n$$ 4 - X = \\sqrt{X^2 + 4} $$\nSquaring both sides (noting we must have $4-X \\ge 0$):\n$$ (4 - X)^2 = X^2 + 4 $$\n$$ 16 - 8X + X^2 = X^2 + 4 $$\n$$ 16 - 8X = 4 $$\n$$ 12 = 8X $$\n$$ X = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\nThe dimensionless wavenumber is $k d_i = 3/2$. This solution is consistent with the condition $X \\le 4$.",
