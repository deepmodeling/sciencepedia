            "introduction": "The foundation of synchrotron radiation lies in the energy lost by an accelerated relativistic charge. This first exercise takes you back to first principles, starting from the general Liénard formula for radiated power. By applying it to the specific case of a particle in uniform circular motion within a magnetic field, you will derive the total energy radiated in a single revolution . This calculation is not merely an academic exercise; it forms the basis for understanding radiation reaction forces and estimating the synchrotron cooling times of electrons in astrophysical environments like pulsar magnetospheres and supernova remnants.",

            "introduction": "Moving from a single particle to a large ensemble, the total radiated power depends critically on the spatial arrangement of the emitters. This practice explores the fundamental distinction between incoherent and coherent emission by considering a beam of $N$ electrons . You will discover how randomly phased electrons lead to a power that scales linearly with $N$, while electrons bunched into a volume smaller than the radiation wavelength produce a dramatic enhancement where the power scales as $N^2$. This principle of constructive interference is the cornerstone of powerful modern radiation sources like Free-Electron Lasers and explains superradiant phenomena observed in astrophysics.",

            "problem": "A particle accelerator is designed to operate as a source of synchrotron radiation. It accelerates a beam of $N$ electrons, each with elementary charge $e$, to a highly relativistic energy $E$. The beam is constrained to a circular path of radius $R$. The accelerator can be operated in two distinct modes.\n\n**Mode 1 (Incoherent):** The $N$ electrons are distributed with random phasing around the circumference of the circular path. The average separation between electrons is much larger than the characteristic wavelength of the emitted radiation.\n\n**Mode 2 (Coherent):** All $N$ electrons are collected into a single, compact bunch. The volume of this bunch is much smaller than the characteristic wavelength of the emitted radiation.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{incoherent}}$ be the total electromagnetic power radiated by the beam in Mode 1, and $P_{\\text{coherent}}$ be the total power radiated by the beam in Mode 2. Assuming the energy $E$ and radius of curvature $R$ are identical for the electrons in both modes, determine the ratio $\\frac{P_{\\text{coherent}}}{P_{\\text{incoherent}}}$. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters.",
            "solution": "We consider the radiated power from $N$ electrons moving on identical circular orbits of radius $R$ with the same energy $E$. Let $P_{1}$ denote the total synchrotron power radiated by a single electron on this trajectory. By the relativistic Larmor formula specialized to circular motion, $P_{1}$ depends on $e$, $E$, and $R$, but its explicit form is not needed because it cancels in the desired ratio.\n\nKey principle: For electromagnetic radiation, the observable power is proportional to the squared magnitude of the total field. For $N$ emitters with complex field amplitudes $A_{j}$ at the detector,\n$$\nI \\propto \\left|\\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_{j}\\right|^{2}=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} |A_{j}|^{2}+\\sum_{\\substack{i,j=1\\\\ i\\neq j}}^{N} A_{i}A_{j}^{*}.\n$$\n\nMode 1 (Incoherent): The electrons are randomly phased and separated by distances much larger than the relevant wavelength, so the cross terms average to zero over time or ensemble:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\sum_{\\substack{i,j=1\\\\ i\\neq j}}^{N} A_{i}A_{j}^{*}\\right\\rangle=0.\n$$\nTherefore, the average intensity and thus the total radiated power add linearly:\n$$\nP_{\\text{incoherent}}=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} P_{1}=N P_{1}.\n$$\n\nMode 2 (Coherent): The bunch size is much smaller than the characteristic wavelength, so all emitters have (approximately) the same phase, $A_{j}\\approx A_{1}$ for all $j$. Then the fields add coherently:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_{j}\\approx N A_{1}\\quad \\Rightarrow\\quad I \\propto |N A_{1}|^{2}=N^{2} |A_{1}|^{2}.\n$$\nHence the total radiated power scales quadratically with $N$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{coherent}}=N^{2} P_{1}.\n$$\n\nTaking the ratio, which is independent of $E$, $R$, and $e$ because $P_{1}$ cancels,\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\text{coherent}}}{P_{\\text{incoherent}}}=\\frac{N^{2} P_{1}}{N P_{1}}=N.\n$$\nThis result follows from linear superposition of fields and the definitions of incoherent versus coherent addition under the given assumptions about phasing and bunch size relative to the characteristic wavelength.",
