It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe system is governed by the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the electron's envelope function $\\psi(x,y,z)$ with effective mass $m^{*}$. In three dimensions, this is:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} \\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y,z) + V(x,y,z) \\psi(x,y,z) = E \\psi(x,y,z)$$\nInside the quantum dot, i.e., for $x \\in (0,L)$, $y \\in (0,L)$, and $z \\in (0,L)$, the potential $V(x,y,z)=0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\right) \\psi(x,y,z) = E \\psi(x,y,z)$$\nThe potential is infinite outside this region, which imposes the boundary condition that the wavefunction $\\psi$ must be zero on the faces of the cube.\n\nWe solve this partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables. Let the wavefunction be a product of three one-dimensional functions: $\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. Substituting this into the equation and dividing by $\\psi(x,y,z)$ yields:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} \\left( \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} + \\frac{1}{Z(z)}\\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2} \\right) = E$$\nSince each term on the left-hand side depends on an independent variable, each must be equal to a constant. We can write:\n$$\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -k_x^2 X(x)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = -k_y^2 Y(y)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2} = -k_z^2 Z(z)$$\nwhere the total energy $E$ is related to these separation constants by:\n$$E = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)$$\nLet's solve the equation for $X(x)$. The general solution is $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x) + B \\cos(k_x x)$. The boundary conditions require $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L)=0$.\nFrom $X(0)=0$, we get $A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x)$.\nFrom $X(L)=0$, we get $A \\sin(k_x L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(k_x L) = 0$. This implies $k_x L = n_x \\pi$, where $n_x$ is an integer. The value $n_x=0$ would lead to $k_x=0$ and thus $X(x)=0$, a trivial solution. Negative integers for $n_x$ do not produce new physical states, as they only change the sign of the wavefunction. Therefore, the quantum number $n_x$ must be a positive integer: $n_x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\nThe allowed values for the wavevector component $k_x$ are quantized:\n$$k_x = \\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}, \\quad n_x = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nBy symmetry, the same logic applies to the $y$ and $z$ directions, yielding:\n$$k_y = \\frac{n_y \\pi}{L}, \\quad n_y = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\n$$k_z = \\frac{n_z \\pi}{L}, \\quad n_z = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$$\nThe discrete energy spectrum of the electron is found by substituting these quantized wavevectors into the expression for the total energy $E$:\n$$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} \\left( \\left(\\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_z \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\right)$$\n$$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m^{*} L^2} (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)$$\nA unique spatial state is defined by a unique triplet of positive integer quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$.\n\nThe problem defines the density of states for this 0D system, $g_{0D}(E)$, as a sum of Dirac delta distributions at each allowed energy level, weighted by the level's degeneracy. We are asked to construct this as a sum over all allowed quantum numbers.\n\nA single spatial state defined by $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ has energy $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z}$. The problem specifies a twofold spin degeneracy, meaning each spatial state can accommodate two electrons (spin-up and spin-down). Therefore, each unique triplet $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ corresponds to 2 quantum states. The total density of states is the sum of contributions from all possible states. To account for all states, we sum over all allowed values of the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$.\n\nThe contribution of a single spatial state $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, including its twofold spin degeneracy, to the total DOS is $2 \\cdot \\delta(E - E_{n_x, n_y, n_z})$.\n\nThe total density of states $g_{0D}(E)$ is the sum of these contributions over all possible combinations of positive integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$:\n$$g_{0D}(E) = \\sum_{n_x=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_y=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_z=1}^{\\infty} 2 \\cdot \\delta(E - E_{n_x, n_y, n_z})$$\nSubstituting the expression for the energy eigenvalues, we obtain the final expression for the density of states:\n$$g_{0D}(E) = 2 \\sum_{n_x=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_y=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_z=1}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(E - \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m^{*} L^2} (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the density of states as a series of infinitely sharp peaks at the discrete energy levels. The summation structure automatically accounts for the orbital degeneracy (multiple combinations of $\\{n_x, n_y, n_z\\}$ yielding the same sum of squares) and the prefactor of $2$ accounts for the spin degeneracy, as required.",

The derivation requested is a standard textbook exercise, and the numerical task is clearly defined. There are no contradictions in the givens.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Tight-Binding Hamiltonian**\nWe start from the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a 2D region where the potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is zero:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^*} \\nabla^2 \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nIn Cartesian coordinates, $\\mathbf{r} = (x,y)$, the Laplacian is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$. We discretize the domain onto a square lattice where each point is indexed by integers $(i,j)$, such that $x=ia$ and $y=ja$, with $a$ being the lattice constant. The wavefunction at a lattice site is denoted $\\psi(ia, ja) \\equiv \\psi_{i,j}$.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are approximated using the second-order central finite difference formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{(ia,ja)} \\approx \\frac{\\psi(x+a, y) - 2\\psi(x, y) + \\psi(x-a, y)}{a^2} = \\frac{\\psi_{i+1,j} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j}}{a^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2}\\bigg|_{(ia,ja)} \\approx \\frac{\\psi(x, y+a) - 2\\psi(x, y) + \\psi(x, y-a)}{a^2} = \\frac{\\psi_{i,j+1} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i,j-1}}{a^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Schrödinger equation yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^*} \\left( \\frac{\\psi_{i+1,j} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j}}{a^2} + \\frac{\\psi_{i,j+1} - 2\\psi_{i,j} + \\psi_{i,j-1}}{a^2} \\right) = E \\psi_{i,j}\n$$\nLet us define the hopping parameter $t = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^* a^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n-t \\left( \\psi_{i+1,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j} + \\psi_{i,j+1} + \\psi_{i,j-1} - 4\\psi_{i,j} \\right) = E \\psi_{i,j}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n4t \\psi_{i,j} - t(\\psi_{i+1,j} + \\psi_{i-1,j} + \\psi_{i,j+1} + \\psi_{i,j-1}) = E \\psi_{i,j}\n$$\nThis equation has the form of a matrix eigenvalue problem, $(H\\Psi)_k = E \\Psi_k$, where $\\Psi$ is a vector whose components $\\Psi_k$ are the wavefunction values $\\psi_{i,j}$ at the sites inside the quantum dot. The index $k$ is a single flattened index corresponding to the 2D coordinate pair $(i,j)$.\n\nBy comparing the rearranged equation with the matrix form $\\sum_l H_{kl} \\Psi_l = E \\Psi_k$, we can identify the Hamiltonian matrix elements:\n- The term multiplying $\\psi_{i,j}$ on the left-hand side gives the on-site (diagonal) element. For a site $k$ corresponding to $(i,j)$, this is $H_{kk} = 4t$. In the general case with an external potential $V_k$, this would be $H_{kk} = 4t + V_k$. Since $V=0$ inside the dot, this matches the given $H_{ii} = 4t$.\n- The term multiplying a nearest-neighbor wavefunction, e.g., $\\psi_{i+1,j}$, gives the off-diagonal element connecting site $(i,j)$ to site $(i+1,j)$. This is $H_{k,l} = -t$ where $l$ corresponds to a nearest neighbor of $k$.\n- For any two sites $k,l$ that are not nearest neighbors, the corresponding coefficient is zero, so $H_{k,l}=0$.\n\nThe Dirichlet boundary conditions ($\\psi=0$ outside the dot) are handled naturally by this construction. When constructing the Hamiltonian matrix, we only consider sites $(i,j)$ that are inside the circular dot. If a site $(i,j)$ is at the edge of the dot, one or more of its neighbors, e.g., $(i+1,j)$, may lie outside. In the finite difference equation for site $(i,j)$, the term $\\psi_{i+1,j}$ is set to zero, which is equivalent to not having a hopping term ($H_{k,l}=0$) between the inside site and the outside site. This is achieved by building the Hamiltonian matrix only over the basis of sites within the dot.\n\n**Numerical Implementation and Analysis**\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Define Geometry**: For a given radius $R_{\\mathrm{sites}}$, identify all integer coordinates $(i,j)$ satisfying the condition $i^2 + j^2 \\le R_{\\mathrm{sites}}^2$. These form the set of $N$ lattice sites of the quantum dot. A mapping is created from each coordinate pair $(i,j)$ to a unique matrix index $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n2.  **Calculate Hopping Parameter $t$**: The parameter $t = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m^* a^2}$ is calculated using the provided physical constants in SI units ($\\hbar$, $m_e$, $a$) and the effective mass ratio $m^*/m_e$. The result is converted from Joules to electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) by dividing by the elementary charge $e$.\n3.  **Construct Hamiltonian $H$**: An $N \\times N$ matrix is initialized to zeros. We iterate through each site $k$ (with coordinates $(i,j)$) in the dot.\n    - The diagonal element is set: $H_{k,k} = 4t$.\n    - For each of the four nearest neighbors of $(i,j)$, we check if the neighbor is also within the dot. If it is, and its matrix index is $l$, we set the off-diagonal element $H_{k,l} = -t$. Since the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, $H_{l,k} = H_{k,l}$.\n4.  **Compute Density of States**: For each test case $(E, \\eta)$, the DOS is calculated using the formula $g(E) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\operatorname{Im} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[ G(E+i\\eta) \\right]$, where $G(z) = (zI - H)^{-1}$ is the Green's function matrix. This involves:\n    - Forming the complex matrix $A = (E + i\\eta)I - H$.\n    - Computing its inverse $G = A^{-1}$.\n    - Calculating the trace of the resulting matrix, $\\operatorname{Tr}(G)$.\n    - Taking the imaginary part and scaling by $-1/\\pi$.\n\n**Analysis of the Broadening Parameter $\\eta$**:\nThe DOS for a finite system with discrete energy levels $E_n$ is formally a sum of Dirac delta functions: $g(E) = \\sum_n \\delta(E-E_n)$. The formula involving $\\eta$ replaces each delta function with a Lorentzian distribution of width $\\eta$: $g(E) = \\sum_n \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\eta}{(E-E_n)^2 + \\eta^2}$.\n- **Cases 1, 2, 3 ($R_{\\mathrm{sites}}=3, E=4t$)**: These cases explore the effect of $\\eta$ at the center of the energy band.\n    - For a very small $\\eta$ ($10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), the Lorentzians are extremely sharp. The value of $g(E)$ will be significant only if $E$ is extremely close to an eigenvalue $E_n$. Otherwise, it will be near zero.\n    - As $\\eta$ increases to $10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the Lorentzians broaden. This acts as an energy averaging. The value of $g(E)$ will reflect the density of eigenvalues in an energy window of width $\\sim \\eta$ around $E$. Since $E=4t$ is the center of the band for an infinite lattice, we expect a high density of states in this region. Thus, increasing $\\eta$ from a very small value should increase $g(E)$ by capturing more contributions from nearby states.\n- **Case 4 ($R_{\\mathrm{sites}}=3, E=50t$)**: The eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian lie within the band $[0, 8t]$. The energy $E=50t$ is far outside this band. For any eigenvalue $E_n$, the term $(E-E_n)^2$ will be very large, making every term in the sum for $g(E)$ infinitesimally small. We expect $g(E)$ to be approximately zero.\n- **Case 5 ($R_{\\mathrm{sites}}=1, E=4t$)**: This dot is much smaller ($N=5$ sites) than the $R_{\\mathrm{sites}}=3$ dot ($N=29$ sites). A smaller system has fewer total states and a larger spacing between energy levels. The total DOS integrated over all energies is equal to the number of states, so we expect the value of $g(E)$ at any given energy to be significantly smaller for the smaller dot. Interestingly, for the $R_{\\mathrm{sites}}=1$ geometry, $E=4t$ is a highly degenerate eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian, which will lead to a large value of $g(4t)$ that is inversely proportional to $\\eta$.",

The program must start from the following fundamental bases and facts:\n\n- The density of states (DOS) $g(E)$ is defined as the number of quantum states per unit area per unit energy at energy $E$ for a two-dimensional system.\n- Under periodic boundary conditions in real space of area $A$, discrete wave vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ in reciprocal space occupy a uniform grid, and the number of states per unit area corresponding to a differential area $d^2k$ in reciprocal space is $d^2k/(2\\pi)^2$.\n- For a two-dimensional parabolic conduction band, the energy dispersion is $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_c + \\hbar^2\\lVert \\mathbf{k}\\rVert^2/(2m^\\ast)$, where $E_c$ is the band edge energy, $m^\\ast$ is the effective mass, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n- To numerically count states at energy $E$, represent the Dirac delta function $\\delta(E - E(\\mathbf{k}))$ by a normalized Gaussian of energy width $\\eta$,\n$$\n\\delta_\\eta\\big(E - E(\\mathbf{k})\\big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\eta}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\big(E - E(\\mathbf{k})\\big)^2}{2\\eta^2}\\right),\n$$\nand approximate the $k$-space integral by a finite sum over a uniform square grid in $\\mathbf{k}$ with spacing $\\Delta k$ and domain cutoff $k_{\\max}$.\n\nAlgorithm specification:\n- Construct a square grid of $k_x$ and $k_y$ over $[-k_{\\max},k_{\\max}] \\times [-k_{\\max},k_{\\max}]$ with $N_k$ points per axis, spacing $\\Delta k = 2k_{\\max}/(N_k-1)$.\n- For each grid point, compute $E(\\mathbf{k})$ using the parabolic dispersion, and form the Gaussian weight $\\delta_\\eta\\big(E - E(\\mathbf{k})\\big)$.\n- Sum the weights over the grid, multiply by $\\Delta k^2$, and normalize by $(2\\pi)^2$ to obtain $g(E)$ per unit area. Include a spin degeneracy factor of $g_s = 2$ (no valley degeneracy).\n- The domain cutoff $k_{\\max}$ must be chosen as a multiple of the constant-energy circle radius $k_0$ that satisfies $E - E_c = \\hbar^2 k_0^2/(2m^\\ast)$, i.e., $k_{\\max} = f \\, k_0$ for a given factor $f$.\n\nYour program must evaluate the numerical DOS and compare it to the exact analytical DOS for a two-dimensional parabolic band with spin degeneracy $g_s = 2$ and zero valley degeneracy, which is constant for $E > E_c$. The analytical DOS per unit area per unit energy is\n$$\ng_{\\text{exact}}(E) = \\frac{g_s\\,m^\\ast}{2\\pi\\,\\hbar^2} \\quad \\text{for } E > E_c,\\quad \\text{and } g_{\\text{exact}}(E)=0 \\text{ for } E \\le E_c.\n$$\nYour program must compute the relative error as a dimensionless float,\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\big|g_{\\text{num}}(E) - g_{\\text{exact}}(E)\\big|}{g_{\\text{exact}}(E)},\n$$\nfor each test case where $E > E_c$.\n\nUnit specifications:\n- Energies $E$ and $E_c$ must be treated in electronvolts (eV) in the test suite and converted to joules (J) internally. The broadening $\\eta$ must be treated in electronvolts (eV) and converted to joules (J). The output relative errors are dimensionless floats (no unit).\n- Effective mass $m^\\ast$ is specified as a multiple of the electron mass $m_e$ (unitless multiplier), internally converted to kilograms (kg).\n- Wave vector $k$ has units of meters inverse ($\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), handled internally.\n\nConvergence discussion requirement:\n- Your solution must reason from the base definitions to explain why the two-dimensional DOS is constant for a parabolic band and how the numerical scheme converges with finer $k$-space grid spacing $\\Delta k$ and sufficiently large $k_{\\max}$. Address the roles of discretization error, domain truncation error, and the choice of broadening $\\eta$ relative to the energy resolution implied by the $k$-grid spacing (through $\\mathrm{d}E/\\mathrm{d}k$).\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case, use $E_c = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and spin degeneracy $g_s = 2$.\n\nProvide the following five parameter sets, each as a tuple $(f_{m^\\ast}, E\\,\\mathrm{(eV)}, N_k, \\eta\\,\\mathrm{(eV)}, f)$ where $f_{m^\\ast}$ is the multiplier on $m_e$ and $f$ sets $k_{\\max} = f\\,k_0$:\n\n1. $(0.067, 0.2, 601, 0.005, 3.0)$ — happy path: fine grid, moderate broadening, sufficiently large domain.\n2. $(0.067, 0.2, 81, 0.005, 3.0)$ — coarse grid: same energy and domain, smaller $N_k$ to test discretization error.\n3. $(0.067, 0.001, 601, 0.0002, 3.0)$ — near band edge: small energy and small broadening, tests sensitivity near $E_c$.\n4. $(0.067, 0.2, 401, 0.005, 0.8)$ — domain truncation: $f < 1$ so $k_{\\max}$ does not cover the constant-energy circle, tests truncation error.\n5. $(0.067, 0.2, 81, 0.03, 3.0)$ — coarse grid with large broadening: tests whether increasing $\\eta$ mitigates discretization effects.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the relative errors for the five test cases, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the test suite above. For example: \"[e1,e2,e3,e4,e5]\".",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard computational physics task rooted in the fundamental principles of semiconductor statistical mechanics. All necessary parameters and methods are explicitly defined, permitting a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the two-dimensional ($2$D) density of states (DOS), $g(E)$, for a parabolic energy band, both analytically and via a numerical k-space discretization, and to evaluate the relative error of the numerical method.\n\nFirst, we derive the analytical expression for the $2$D DOS for a parabolic band to establish the theoretical baseline and address the required discussion on why it is constant. The DOS per unit area is defined as the sum over all allowed quantum states $\\mathbf{k}$ per unit energy, including a spin degeneracy factor $g_s$. In the continuous limit for a large area $A$, the sum over discrete $\\mathbf{k}$-states is replaced by an integral over k-space:\n$$\ng(E) = \\frac{g_s}{A} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\delta(E - E(\\mathbf{k})) \\longrightarrow g_s \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\delta(E - E(\\mathbf{k}))\n$$\nThe energy dispersion relation is given as $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\lVert \\mathbf{k} \\rVert^2}{2m^\\ast}$, where $E_c$ is the conduction band minimum, $m^\\ast$ is the effective mass, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For simplicity, we express the energy in terms of the magnitude of the wave vector, $k = \\lVert \\mathbf{k} \\rVert$, as $E(k) = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^\\ast}$.\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we transform to polar coordinates in k-space, where the differential area element is $d^2k = k \\, dk \\, d\\theta$.\n$$\ng(E) = g_s \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_0^\\infty dk \\, \\frac{k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\delta\\left(E - \\left(E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^\\ast}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe integrand is independent of the angle $\\theta$, so the angular integral yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\ng(E) = \\frac{g_s}{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty k \\, dk \\, \\delta\\left(E - E_c - \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^\\ast}\\right)\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables to evaluate the remaining integral. Let $u = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^\\ast}$. The differential is $du = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^\\ast} dk$, which gives $k \\, dk = \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\hbar^2} du$. The integration limits change from $k \\in [0, \\infty)$ to $u \\in [E_c, \\infty)$.\n$$\ng(E) = \\frac{g_s}{2\\pi} \\int_{E_c}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{m^\\ast}{\\hbar^2}\\right) du \\, \\delta((E-E_c) - (u-E_c)) = \\frac{g_s m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\int_{E_c}^\\infty du \\, \\delta(E - u)\n$$\nBy the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, the integral is $1$ if the point $u=E$ lies within the integration domain—that is, if $E > E_c$—and $0$ otherwise. Therefore, the analytical DOS for a $2$D parabolic band is:\n$$\ng_{\\text{exact}}(E) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{g_s m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} & \\text{for } E > E_c \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } E \\le E_c \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that for energies above the band edge, the $2$D DOS is constant, a hallmark feature of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).\n\nNext, we formalize the numerical procedure. The task is to approximate the k-space integral by a sum over a discrete grid. The Dirac delta function, $\\delta(x)$, is unsuited for direct numerical evaluation and is thus regularized using a normalized Gaussian function of width $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\delta(E - E(\\mathbf{k})) \\approx \\delta_\\eta(E - E(\\mathbf{k})) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\eta}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(E - E(\\mathbf{k}))^2}{2\\eta^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe continuous integral $\\iint dk_x dk_y$ is replaced by a sum over grid points $(k_{x,i}, k_{y,j})$ with a uniform spacing $\\Delta k$, such that the area element becomes $\\Delta k^2$. The numerical DOS, $g_{\\text{num}}(E)$, is then calculated as:\n$$\ng_{\\text{num}}(E) = \\frac{g_s}{(2\\pi)^2} \\sum_{i,j} \\delta_\\eta(E - E(k_{x,i}, k_{y,j})) \\Delta k^2\n$$\nThe sum is performed over a square grid in k-space defined by $k_x, k_y \\in [-k_{\\max}, k_{\\max}]$, with $N_k$ points along each axis and spacing $\\Delta k = 2k_{\\max}/(N_k-1)$.\n\nThe numerical accuracy of this method is subject to three primary sources of error, which we must analyze:\n$1$. Discretization Error: This arises from approximating the continuous integral with a finite Riemann sum. The accuracy depends on the grid density. A coarser grid (larger $\\Delta k$, smaller $N_k$) provides a poorer approximation of the integral. As $N_k \\to \\infty$ (and thus $\\Delta k \\to 0$), the sum converges to the integral, and this error diminishes. Test Case $2$ ($N_k=81$) is designed to exhibit larger discretization error compared to Test Case $1$ ($N_k=601$).\n$2$. Domain Truncation Error: The integral is taken over a finite square, $[-k_{\\max}, k_{\\max}]^2$, instead of the infinite k-plane. The integrand, $\\delta_\\eta(E - E(\\mathbf{k}))$, is maximally concentrated on the constant-energy circle defined by $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E$. The radius of this circle is $k_0 = \\sqrt{2m^\\ast(E-E_c)}/\\hbar$. If $k_{\\max}$ is not significantly larger than $k_0$ (i.e., the factor $f$ in $k_{\\max} = f \\cdot k_0$ is not large enough), the calculation will omit contributions from parts of k-space where the Gaussian is non-negligible, leading to an underestimation of the DOS. Test Case $4$ ($f=0.8$) deliberately truncates the domain before the constant-energy circle is fully enclosed, which is expected to produce a large error.\n$3$. Broadening Error: The Gaussian function is an approximation of the Dirac delta function. The choice of the broadening parameter, $\\eta$, is critical. For the approximation to be valid, $\\eta$ should be small. However, on a discrete grid, if $\\eta$ is smaller than the characteristic energy spacing between adjacent k-points, $\\Delta E_{\\text{grid}} \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}k}|_{k_0} \\Delta k$, the Gaussian may become too narrow, \"falling between\" grid points and leading to a noisy, inaccurate sum. Conversely, a very large $\\eta$ over-smooths the DOS, reducing energy resolution and poorly approximating the delta function. A suitable $\\eta$ must be large enough to smoothly sample the discrete k-points but small enough to represent a sharp energy level. Test Case $5$ explores how a large $\\eta$ can mitigate the noise from a coarse grid by averaging over more states, potentially reducing the error observed in Test Case $2$ at the cost of physical resolution.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by first defining the physical constants and the test case parameters. For each case, all inputs in electronvolts (eV) are converted to SI units (Joules). The analytical DOS, $g_{\\text{exact}}$, is computed as a reference. The k-space grid is constructed according to the specified $N_k$ and $k_{\\max}$, which is derived from $E$ and $m^\\ast$. The energy $E(\\mathbf{k})$ is calculated for every point on the grid. Subsequently, the Gaussian weights are computed and summed, applying the appropriate normalization factors to obtain $g_{\\text{num}}$. Finally, the relative error, $\\varepsilon = |g_{\\text{num}} - g_{\\text{exact}}|/g_{\\text{exact}}$, is calculated and stored. This process is repeated for all five test cases. The final output is a list of these relative errors.",
