The additivity of rates $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}=\\sum_{i}\\Gamma_{i}$ assumes statistically independent, Poissonian events. If scattering events are temporally or spatially correlated (for example, impurity potentials dynamically dressed by phonons, carrier trapping–detrapping sequences that condition subsequent momentum relaxation, or clustering of impurities creating multiple small-angle deflections in rapid succession), the waiting-time distribution is not exponential, and simple rate additivity fails. In such cases, the effective transport relaxation time is not given by the inverse of a sum of independent instantaneous rates, and consequently the mobility cannot be constructed from a naive sum.\n\n(ii) Energy-dependent relaxation times with dissimilar exponents. In general, for a parabolic band and nondegenerate statistics, the mobility involves the energy average\n$$\n\\mu=\\frac{2 q}{3 m^{*} k_{B} T}\\,\\frac{\\int E\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E)\\,f_{0}(E)\\,g(E)\\,dE}{\\int f_{0}(E)\\,g(E)\\,dE},\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E)}=\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}(E)}.\n$$\nSuppose $\\tau_{i}(E)=C_{i}\\,E^{r_{i}}$ (possibly with temperature prefactors). If the exponents $r_{i}$ differ across mechanisms, then\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E)=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i} C_{i}^{-1} E^{-r_{i}}}\n$$\ndoes not factor out of the integral, and the harmonic-sum relation $1/\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}=\\sum_{i} 1/\\mu_{i}$ does not hold. Only in special cases—such as energy-independent $\\tau_{i}$, or mechanisms sharing the same energy exponent so that a common factorization is possible—does Matthiessen’s rule become a good approximation. When the energy dependences are dissimilar, the nonlinearity of the averaging operation over $E$ prevents additivity of mobilities, leading to quantitative deviations that can be substantial, especially when one mechanism dominates at low energies and another at high energies.\n\nIn summary, the calculated total mobility under the stated energy-independent and uncorrelated assumptions is obtained by adding rates and using $\\mu=q\\tau/m^{*}$. However, correlated scattering and differing energy dependences in relaxation times break the conditions required for Matthiessen’s rule to be valid, and the mobility must then be computed from the full energy-dependent integral rather than from additive mobilities.",

For a spatially uniform system in a steady state ($dv/dt = 0$), the momentum balance equation is:\n$$qE - \\frac{m^\\ast v}{\\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{e})} = 0$$\nSolving for the drift velocity $v$ gives the first key relation, which defines the electron mobility $\\mu(T_\\mathrm{e}) = q \\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{e})/m^\\ast$:\n$$v = \\frac{q\\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{e})}{m^\\ast} E = \\mu(T_\\mathrm{e}) E$$\nHere, the electron temperature $T_\\mathrm{e}$ is an unknown that must be determined from the energy balance.\n\n**2. Steady-State Energy Balance**\n\nThe second moment of the BTE describes energy conservation. In a steady state, the average power gained by an electron from the electric field (Joule heating) is exactly balanced by the average power it loses to the semiconductor lattice (e.g., via phonon emission).\n\nThe power input per electron is the dot product of force and velocity, $P_\\mathrm{in} = F \\cdot v = (qE)v = qEv$. Since $v$ and $E$ have the same sign, this product is always non-negative, correctly representing energy gain.\n\nThe average kinetic energy of an electron in the gas, assuming a 3D thermal velocity distribution, is $\\frac{3}{2}k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{e}$. The lattice acts as a thermal reservoir at temperature $T_\\mathrm{L}$, corresponding to a thermal equilibrium energy of $\\frac{3}{2}k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{L}$. The excess energy of an average electron is thus $\\frac{3}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}(T_\\mathrm{e} - T_\\mathrm{L})$. The rate of energy loss to the lattice is modeled by dividing this excess energy by the constant energy relaxation time $\\tau_\\mathrm{E}$:\n$$P_\\mathrm{loss} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}k_\\mathrm{B}(T_\\mathrm{e} - T_\\mathrm{L})}{\\tau_\\mathrm{E}}$$\nEquating power gain and loss ($P_\\mathrm{in} = P_\\mathrm{loss}$):\n$$qEv = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B}(T_\\mathrm{e} - T_\\mathrm{L})}{\\tau_\\mathrm{E}}$$\nThis equation provides the second key relation. We can rearrange it to express the electron temperature $T_\\mathrm{e}$ in terms of $v$ and $E$. Note that the product $Ev = E(\\mu E) = \\mu E^2$ is always non-negative, ensuring that Joule heating leads to $T_\\mathrm{e} \\ge T_\\mathrm{L}$.\n$$T_\\mathrm{e} = T_\\mathrm{L} + \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{q\\tau_\\mathrm{E}}{k_\\mathrm{B}} Ev$$\n\n**3. Coupled System and Nonlinear Equation for Drift Velocity**\n\nWe now have a system of two coupled equations for the two unknowns, $v$ and $T_\\mathrm{e}$:\n$$v = \\frac{q E}{m^\\ast} \\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{e})$$\n$$T_\\mathrm{e} = T_\\mathrm{L} + \\frac{2 q \\tau_\\mathrm{E}}{3 k_\\mathrm{B}} Ev$$\nWe introduce the specified model for the momentum relaxation time:\n$$\\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{e}) = \\tau_0 \\left(\\frac{T_\\mathrm{ref}}{T_\\mathrm{e}}\\right)^\\alpha$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_\\mathrm{e}$ into the model for $\\tau_\\mathrm{m}$, and then substituting that into the equation for $v$, we obtain a single, self-consistent nonlinear equation for the drift velocity $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{q E \\tau_0}{m^\\ast} \\left( \\frac{T_\\mathrm{ref}}{T_\\mathrm{L} + \\frac{2 q \\tau_\\mathrm{E}}{3 k_\\mathrm{B}} Ev} \\right)^\\alpha$$\nThis equation must be solved for $v$. A unique, physically meaningful solution is guaranteed to exist. For $E > 0$, we seek a solution $v > 0$. The left side, $f(v) = v$, is linear with slope $1$. The right side, $g(v)$, is a monotonically decreasing function of $v$ that starts at a positive value $g(0) > 0$ and tends to $0$ as $v \\to \\infty$. A unique intersection point is therefore guaranteed. A similar argument holds for $E < 0$ and $v < 0$.\n\n**4. Drift-Diffusion Model and Comparison Ratio**\n\nThe drift-diffusion model assumes that carriers remain in thermal equilibrium with the lattice, i.e., $T_\\mathrm{e} = T_\\mathrm{L}$. This corresponds to the low-field limit where Joule heating is negligible. The mobility is thus a constant, $\\mu_0$, evaluated at $T_\\mathrm{L}$.\n$$\\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{L}) = \\tau_0 \\left(\\frac{T_\\mathrm{ref}}{T_\\mathrm{L}}\\right)^\\alpha$$\nThe low-field mobility is $\\mu_0 = \\frac{q \\tau_\\mathrm{m}(T_\\mathrm{L})}{m^\\ast}$, and the drift-diffusion velocity is:\n$$v_\\mathrm{dd} = \\mu_0 E = \\frac{q \\tau_0 E}{m^\\ast} \\left(\\frac{T_\\mathrm{ref}}{T_\\mathrm{L}}\\right)^\\alpha$$\nThe problem specifies $T_\\mathrm{ref} = T_\\mathrm{L} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, which simplifies this to $v_\\mathrm{dd} = \\frac{q \\tau_0 E}{m^\\ast}$. Let's denote the magnitude of this velocity as $v_0 = |v_\\mathrm{dd}| = \\frac{q \\tau_0 |E|}{m^\\ast}$.\n\nWe seek the ratio $r = v_\\mathrm{hydro} / v_\\mathrm{dd}$. Since $v_\\mathrm{hydro}$ and $v_\\mathrm{dd}$ share the sign of $E$, this is equivalent to the ratio of their magnitudes, $r = |v_\\mathrm{hydro}| / |v_\\mathrm{dd}| = v_\\mathrm{mag} / v_0$. Let $E_\\mathrm{abs} = |E|$. The equation for the hydrodynamic velocity magnitude $v_\\mathrm{mag} = |v_\\mathrm{hydro}|$ becomes:\n$$v_\\mathrm{mag} = \\frac{q E_\\mathrm{abs} \\tau_0}{m^\\ast} \\left( \\frac{T_\\mathrm{L}}{T_\\mathrm{L} + \\frac{2 q \\tau_\\mathrm{E}}{3 k_\\mathrm{B}} E_\\mathrm{abs} v_\\mathrm{mag}} \\right)^\\alpha = v_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2q\\tau_\\mathrm{E} E_\\mathrm{abs}}{3k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{L}} v_\\mathrm{mag} \\right)^{-\\alpha}$$\nDividing by $v_0$ and substituting $r = v_\\mathrm{mag}/v_0$:\n$$r = \\left( 1 + \\frac{2q\\tau_\\mathrm{E} E_\\mathrm{abs}}{3k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{L}} (r v_0) \\right)^{-\\alpha}$$\nLet's define a dimensionless parameter $\\beta$ that quantifies the heating effect:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{2q\\tau_\\mathrm{E} E_\\mathrm{abs} v_0}{3k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{2q\\tau_\\mathrm{E} E_\\mathrm{abs}}{3k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{L}} \\left( \\frac{q \\tau_0 E_\\mathrm{abs}}{m^\\ast} \\right) = \\frac{2 q^2 \\tau_0 \\tau_\\mathrm{E} E^2}{3 m^\\ast k_\\mathrm{B} T_\\mathrm{L}}$$\nNote that $\\beta$ depends on $E^2$, so it is independent of the sign of the field. The final equation for the ratio $r$ is:\n$$r = (1 + \\beta r)^{-\\alpha}$$\nThis can be rewritten as $r(1 + \\beta r)^\\alpha - 1 = 0$.\n\n**5. Numerical Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe final task is to solve the nonlinear equation $h(r) = r(1 + \\beta r)^\\alpha - 1 = 0$ for the ratio $r$.\nGiven that $\\alpha \\ge 0$ and $\\beta \\ge 0$:\n- At $r=0$, $h(0) = -1$.\n- As carrier heating reduces mobility for $\\alpha > 0$, we expect $v_\\mathrm{hydro} \\le v_\\mathrm{dd}$, which implies $0 < r \\le 1$.\n- At $r=1$, $h(1) = 1(1 + \\beta)^\\alpha - 1 \\ge 0$.\nSince $h(r)$ is continuous and monotonic for $r>0$, and we have found that $h(0) < 0$ and $h(1) \\ge 0$, a unique root is guaranteed to exist in the interval $(0, 1]$.\nA robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the bisection method or Brent's method, can be applied to the function $h(r)$ on the interval $[0, 1]$ to find the value of $r$ for each test case. The special case $\\alpha=0$ yields $r - 1 = 0$, so $r=1$, which serves as a useful check.\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each test case $(E, \\alpha, \\tau_\\mathrm{E})$, calculate the dimensionless parameter $\\beta$.\n2. If $\\alpha=0$, the result is $r=1$.\n3. If $\\alpha>0$, solve the equation $h(r) = r(1 + \\beta r)^\\alpha - 1 = 0$ for $r$ using a numerical root-finder on the interval $(0, 1]$.\n4. Collect the values of $r$ for all test cases.",
