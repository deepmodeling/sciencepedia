The concepts of Fermi-Dirac statistics, the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation, chemical potential, and temperature are all fundamental principles in this field. The problem is well-posed, providing clear definitions and a specific, unambiguous objective. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information (given the standard definitions of the distributions are assumed), or scientifically unsound premises. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe first step is to express the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution and its Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) approximation in terms of the given dimensionless parameter $\\eta$.\n\nThe FD distribution for fermions is given by:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right) + 1}$$\nThe problem defines the dimensionless parameter $\\eta = \\frac{\\mu-E}{k_{B}T}$. We can see that $\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T} = -\\eta$. Substituting this into the FD distribution gives:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E(\\eta)) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-\\eta) + 1}$$\n\nThe MB distribution is an approximation to the FD distribution valid in the nondegenerate limit, where the occupation probability of any given state is very small. This occurs when the energy $E$ is significantly higher than the Fermi level $\\mu$, i.e., $E - \\mu \\gg k_{B}T$. In terms of $\\eta$, this condition is equivalent to $-\\eta \\gg 0$, or $\\eta \\ll 0$.\nIn this limit, $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\exp(-\\eta) \\gg 1$. The term $+1$ in the denominator of the FD distribution becomes negligible compared to the exponential term:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu-E}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThis approximation is the MB distribution:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{MB}}(E(\\eta)) = \\exp(\\eta)$$\n\nNow, we can derive the expression for the relative error, $\\delta(\\eta)$, as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\\delta(\\eta) = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E) - f_{\\mathrm{MB}}(E)}{f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E)} = 1 - \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{MB}}(E)}{f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E)}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{\\mathrm{FD}}(E(\\eta))$ and $f_{\\mathrm{MB}}(E(\\eta))$:\n$$\\delta(\\eta) = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(\\eta)}{\\frac{1}{\\exp(-\\eta) + 1}}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\delta(\\eta) = 1 - \\exp(\\eta) \\left( \\exp(-\\eta) + 1 \\right)$$\nDistributing the $\\exp(\\eta)$ term:\n$$\\delta(\\eta) = 1 - \\left( \\exp(\\eta)\\exp(-\\eta) + \\exp(\\eta) \\right) = 1 - \\left( \\exp(0) + \\exp(\\eta) \\right) = 1 - (1 + \\exp(\\eta))$$\nThis leads to the final expression for the relative error:\n$$\\delta(\\eta) = -\\exp(\\eta)$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to find the threshold value $\\eta^{\\ast}$ such that $|\\delta(\\eta)| < 0.01$ for all $\\eta < \\eta^{\\ast}$.\nWe start with the inequality:\n$$|\\delta(\\eta)| < 0.01$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta(\\eta)$:\n$$|-\\exp(\\eta)| < 0.01$$\nSince the exponential function $\\exp(\\eta)$ is always positive for any real $\\eta$, the absolute value simply removes the negative sign:\n$$\\exp(\\eta) < 0.01$$\nTo solve for $\\eta$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Since the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is a strictly increasing function for $x>0$, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(\\eta)) < \\ln(0.01)$$\n$$\\eta < \\ln(0.01)$$\nThe problem asks for the threshold value $\\eta^{\\ast}$ such that the condition is satisfied for all $\\eta < \\eta^{\\ast}$. The derived solution is the set of all $\\eta$ in the interval $(-\\infty, \\ln(0.01))$. By comparing this interval to the required form $(-\\infty, \\eta^{\\ast})$, we can directly identify $\\eta^{\\ast}$.\nThus, the threshold value is:\n$$\\eta^{\\ast} = \\ln(0.01)$$\nThis is a closed-form expression as required.\n\nThe two results are the expression for the relative error, $\\delta(\\eta) = -\\exp(\\eta)$, and the threshold value, $\\eta^{\\ast} = \\ln(0.01)$.",

The quantity to be differentiated is:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{J}{T^2}\\right) = \\ln(A^*) + \\ln\\left( F_1\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_C - \\phi_B}{k_B} x\\right) \\right) $$\nThe slope $S$ is:\n$$ S = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{J}{T^2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\ln(F_1(\\eta'(x))) \\right] $$\nUsing the chain rule and the property of Fermi-Dirac integrals $\\frac{dF_j(\\eta)}{d\\eta} = j F_{j-1}(\\eta)$:\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{F_1(\\eta')} \\frac{dF_1(\\eta')}{d\\eta'} \\frac{d\\eta'}{dx} = \\frac{F_0(\\eta')}{F_1(\\eta')} \\left( \\frac{E_F - E_C - \\phi_B}{k_B} \\right) $$\nBy definition, the extracted barrier height is $\\phi_B^{(\\mathrm{MB})} = -k_B S$. Let $\\Delta = E_F - E_C$.\n$$ \\phi_B^{(\\mathrm{MB})} = -k_B \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta - \\phi_B}{k_B} \\frac{F_0(\\eta')}{F_1(\\eta')} \\right] = (\\phi_B - \\Delta) \\frac{F_0(\\eta')}{F_1(\\eta')} $$\nwhere $\\eta' = (\\Delta - \\phi_B)/(k_B T)$. The extraction error is $\\delta\\phi = \\phi_B^{(\\mathrm{MB})} - \\phi_B$.\n$$ \\delta\\phi = (\\phi_B - \\Delta) \\frac{F_0\\left(\\frac{\\Delta - \\phi_B}{k_B T}\\right)}{F_1\\left(\\frac{\\Delta - \\phi_B}{k_B T}\\right)} - \\phi_B $$\n\nNow, a specific case is considered: $\\phi_B = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $\\Delta = E_F-E_C = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nWe first compute the argument of the Fermi-Dirac integrals:\n$$ \\eta' = \\frac{\\Delta - \\phi_B}{k_B T} = \\frac{0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{k_B T} = 0 $$\nWe need to evaluate $F_0(0)$ and $F_1(0)$.\nThe Fermi-Dirac integral of order $0$ is $F_0(\\eta) = \\ln(1+e^\\eta)$.\n$$ F_0(0) = \\ln(1+e^0) = \\ln(2) $$\nThe Fermi-Dirac integral of order $1$ for $\\eta=0$ is a known constant:\n$$ F_1(0) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{1+e^\\epsilon} d\\epsilon = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12} $$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\phi_B^{(\\mathrm{MB})}$:\n$$ \\phi_B^{(\\mathrm{MB})} = (0.25 - 0.25) \\frac{F_0(0)}{F_1(0)} = 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\pi^2/12} = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe extraction error $\\delta\\phi$ is then:\n$$ \\delta\\phi = \\phi_B^{(\\mathrm{MB})} - \\phi_B = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV} = -0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\delta\\phi = -0.2500\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The negative sign indicates that the incorrectly extracted barrier height is significantly lower than the true value. This happens because when $E_F$ is at the barrier peak, the current is only weakly dependent on temperature ($J \\propto T^2$), leading to a near-zero slope on the Richardson plot, which is misinterpreted as a near-zero activation barrier.\n\nFinally, we propose a correction procedure to find the true $\\phi_B$. The derived relationship for the slope $S$ at a given temperature $T$ is:\n$$ S k_B = (\\Delta - \\phi_B) \\frac{F_0\\left(\\frac{\\Delta - \\phi_B}{k_B T}\\right)}{F_1\\left(\\frac{\\Delta - \\phi_B}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nThis equation relates the measured slope $S$ to two unknowns: the barrier height $\\phi_B$ and the Fermi level position $\\Delta = E_F-E_C$. To solve for $\\phi_B$, $\\Delta$ must be determined independently. The position of the Fermi level $\\Delta$ is determined by the carrier concentration $n$ and temperature $T$ through the relation:\n$$ n = N_C(T) F_{1/2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $N_C(T) = 2(m_n k_B T / 2\\pi\\hbar^2)^{3/2}$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band.\nThe correction procedure is as follows:\n1. Determine the semiconductor's electron effective mass $m_n$ and carrier concentration $n$ through independent measurements (e.g., cyclotron resonance and Hall effect measurements, respectively).\n2. For a given temperature $T$, calculate $N_C(T)$. Then, solve the equation $n/N_C(T) = F_{1/2}(\\Delta/(k_B T))$ numerically to find the value of $\\Delta = E_F-E_C$.\n3. Measure the emission current density $J$ over a range of temperatures and construct the Richardson plot of $\\ln(J/T^2)$ versus $1/T$. Determine the local slope $S$ at a chosen temperature $T$.\n4. Let $X = \\Delta - \\phi_B$. The measured slope and the known $\\Delta$ are related through the transcendental equation:\n$$ S k_B = X \\frac{F_0(X/(k_B T))}{F_1(X/(k_B T))} $$\nSolve this equation numerically for $X$.\n5. The true barrier height is then calculated as $\\phi_B = \\Delta - X$. This procedure correctly accounts for the Fermi-Dirac statistics and yields the true barrier height.",
