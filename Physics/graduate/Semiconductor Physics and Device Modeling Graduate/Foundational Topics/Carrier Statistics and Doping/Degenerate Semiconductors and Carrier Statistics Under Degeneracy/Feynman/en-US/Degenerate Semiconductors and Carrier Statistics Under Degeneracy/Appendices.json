The conclusions are calculable and verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n### **Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe position of the Fermi level $E_F$ is determined by the principle of charge neutrality. The general charge neutrality equation is:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nwhere $p$ is the hole concentration, $n$ is the electron concentration, $N_D^+$ is the concentration of ionized donors, and $N_A^-$ is the concentration of ionized acceptors.\n\nThe problem states that the semiconductor is heavily n-type, so the Fermi level will be in the upper part of the bandgap or in the conduction band, far from the valence band edge $E_V$. Consequently, the hole concentration $p$ is negligible ($p \\ll n$). The problem also states that at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the shallow dopants are effectively fully ionized, which implies $N_D^+ \\approx N_D$ and $N_A^- \\approx N_A$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the charge neutrality equation simplifies to:\n$$N_D \\approx n + N_A$$\nThis allows us to determine the free electron concentration $n$:\n$$n \\approx N_D - N_A$$\nThe electron concentration $n$ is related to the Fermi level $E_F$ and the conduction band structure. For a 3D parabolic band, this relationship is given by the Fermi-Dirac integral of order $1/2$:\n$$n = N_C F_{1/2}\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_C}{k_B T}\\right) = N_C F_{1/2}(\\eta_F)$$\nwhere $\\eta_F = (E_F - E_C)/(k_B T)$ is the reduced Fermi energy. The function $F_{1/2}(\\eta_F)$ has two important limits:\n1.  **Non-degenerate limit** ($\\eta_F \\ll 0$, i.e., $E_F$ is several $k_B T$ below $E_C$): $F_{1/2}(\\eta_F) \\approx e^{\\eta_F}$. This leads to $n \\approx N_C e^{-(E_C - E_F)/k_B T}$.\n2.  **Degenerate limit** ($\\eta_F \\gg 0$, i.e., $E_F$ is several $k_B T$ above $E_C$): $F_{1/2}(\\eta_F) \\approx \\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\eta_F^{3/2}$.\n\nWe will now analyze the two samples.\n\n**Sample 1 (Uncompensated):**\n- $N_D = 5.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $N_A \\approx 0$\nThe net electron concentration is $n_1 \\approx N_D - N_A = 5.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nWe can find the position of the Fermi level $E_{F1}$ by solving:\n$$n_1 = N_C F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F1})$$\n$$5.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = (2.8\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F1})$$\n$$F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F1}) = \\frac{5.0}{2.8} \\approx 1.786$$\nSince $F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F1}) > 1$, the non-degenerate approximation is invalid. The system must be degenerate, meaning $\\eta_{F1} > 0$ and $E_{F1} > E_C$.\nUsing the degenerate approximation to estimate the position:\n$$1.786 \\approx \\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\eta_{F1}^{3/2}$$\n$$\\eta_{F1}^{3/2} \\approx 1.786 \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\approx 2.375$$\n$$\\eta_{F1} \\approx (2.375)^{2/3} \\approx 1.78$$\nSo, for Sample 1, the Fermi level is located at $E_{F1} \\approx E_C + 1.78 k_B T$. This confirms donor-induced degeneracy, with the Fermi level pushed into the conduction band.\n\n**Sample 2 (Compensated):**\n- $N_D = 5.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $N_A = 4.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\nThe net electron concentration is $n_2 \\approx N_D - N_A = 1.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nThe acceptors have \"compensated\" for most of the donors. The position of the new Fermi level $E_{F2}$ is found by solving:\n$$n_2 = N_C F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F2})$$\n$$1.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = (2.8\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F2})$$\n$$F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F2}) = \\frac{1.0}{2.8} \\approx 0.357$$\nSince $F_{1/2}(\\eta_{F2})  1$, the system is likely non-degenerate or only weakly degenerate. We can use the non-degenerate approximation $F_{1/2}(\\eta_F) \\approx e^{\\eta_F}$:\n$$e^{\\eta_{F2}} \\approx 0.357$$\n$$\\eta_{F2} \\approx \\ln(0.357) \\approx -1.03$$\nThis value of $\\eta_{F2} \\approx -1.03$ is negative, which means the Fermi level has moved into the bandgap: $E_{F2} \\approx E_C - 1.03 k_B T$. The non-degenerate approximation is reasonably valid here.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusions:**\n1.  Compensation drastically reduces the free electron concentration from $n_1 = 5.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ to $n_2 = 1.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n2.  This reduction in $n$ causes the Fermi level to shift downwards significantly.\n3.  The Fermi level moves from a position $E_{F1} \\approx E_C + 1.78 k_B T$ (well inside the conduction band, degenerate) to a position $E_{F2} \\approx E_C - 1.03 k_B T$ (inside the bandgap, non-degenerate).\n4.  The total downward shift is $\\Delta E_F = E_{F2} - E_{F1} \\approx (-1.03 - 1.78)k_B T = -2.81 k_B T$. This shift is on the order of several $k_B T$.\n5.  Therefore, compensation has lifted the degeneracy that was present in the uncompensated sample.\n\n### **Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. With compensation, $E_F$ remains well above $E_C$ because $N_D$ is still greater than $N_C$, so degeneracy is essentially unchanged.**\nThe premise that the Fermi level position is dictated by the total donor density $N_D$ is incorrect. It is dictated by the *net free electron concentration*, which is $n \\approx N_D - N_A$. In the compensated sample, $n = 1.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, which is less than $N_C$. Our calculation shows $E_F$ moves below $E_C$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Compensation reduces the net electron concentration to $N_D-N_A$, pulling $E_F$ downward from above $E_C$ to below $E_C$ by an amount on the order of $k_B T$, thereby weakening or lifting degeneracy.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes our findings. Compensation reduces $n$ to $N_D - N_A$. This lower $n$ requires a lower $E_F$. Our calculation explicitly shows $E_F$ moving from above $E_C$ (degenerate) to below $E_C$ (non-degenerate). The calculated shift is $-2.81 k_B T$, which is \"on the order of $k_B T$\". The degeneracy is lifted.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Compensation increases the number of ionized donors and pushes $E_F$ further into the conduction band because the presence of acceptors raises $E_F$.**\nThis statement is physically incorrect. The presence of acceptors provides states at energy $E_A$ for electrons to occupy. This removes free electrons from the conduction band, thus *lowering* the Fermi level $E_F$, not raising it. Pushing $E_F$ further into the conduction band would imply an *increase* in degeneracy, which is the opposite of the actual effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Compensation pins $E_F$ near the intrinsic level $E_i$ regardless of the value of $N_D-N_A$, because neutrality with both dopant types overrides the band statistics.**\nPinning near the intrinsic level $E_i$ only occurs for a perfectly compensated semiconductor ($N_D = N_A$) or when the net doping $N_D - N_A$ is comparable to the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ (which is $\\sim 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for Si). In this problem, the net doping is $N_D - N_A = 1.0\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, which is many orders of magnitude larger than $n_i$. The material remains strongly n-type, and $E_F$ will be in the upper half of the bandgap, far from $E_i$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, in a $p$-$n$ junction arises from the band bending required to align the Fermi level, $E_F$, to a constant value throughout the device at thermal equilibrium. The total potential energy difference across the junction for an electron is $qV_{bi}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge. This energy difference equals the difference in the conduction band edge energies between the neutral $p$-side and the neutral $n$-side.\n\nLet $E_c$ and $E_v$ denote the conduction and valence band edges, respectively. Subscripts $n$ and $p$ will refer to the neutral $n$-type and $p$-type regions. The built-in potential energy is given by:\n$$qV_{bi} = E_{c,p} - E_{c,n}$$\nWe can express this relation by inserting the constant Fermi level $E_F$ and the bandgap $E_g$:\n$$qV_{bi} = (E_{c,p} - E_{v,p}) + (E_{v,p} - E_F) - (E_{c,n} - E_F)$$\nRecognizing that $E_g = E_{c,p} - E_{v,p}$, a material constant, this becomes:\n$$qV_{bi} = E_g + (E_{v,p} - E_F) + (E_F - E_{c,n})$$\nThis equation is general and holds irrespective of the carrier statistics used.\n\nFirst, we will find the built-in potential using the exact Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics, denoted as $V_{bi}^{\\mathrm{FD}}$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Quantum Capacitance ($C_{Q}$)**\n\nThe first step is to determine the density of states per unit area for a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a parabolic band structure. The energy-momentum dispersion relation is given by $E(\\vec{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^{\\star}}$, where $k = |\\vec{k}|$ is the magnitude of the wavevector. The number of states in $k$-space up to a radius $k$ for a sample of area $A$ is given by the area of the circle $\\pi k^2$ multiplied by the degeneracy $g$, and divided by the area per state in k-space, $(2\\pi)^2/A$.\nThe number of states per unit area with wavevector magnitude less than $k$ is:\n$$N(k) = \\frac{g \\cdot \\pi k^2}{(2\\pi)^2} = \\frac{g k^2}{4\\pi}$$\nThe density of states in energy, $D_{2D}(E)$, is defined as the number of states per unit area per unit energy. We can find this by differentiating $N$ with respect to $E$:\n$$D_{2D}(E) = \\frac{dN}{dE} = \\frac{dN}{dk} \\frac{dk}{dE}$$\nFrom the dispersion relation, $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m^{\\star} E}}{\\hbar}$. Differentiating this gives $\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{\\frac{m^{\\star}}{2E}}$.\nAlso, from $N(k)$, we have $\\frac{dN}{dk} = \\frac{g k}{2\\pi}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $D_{2D}(E)$:\n$$D_{2D}(E) = \\left(\\frac{g k}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sqrt{\\frac{m^{\\star}}{2E}}\\right) = \\frac{g}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2 m^{\\star} E}}{\\hbar}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{m^{\\star}}{2E}} = \\frac{g m^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$$\nA key result for a 2DEG with a parabolic band is that its density of states $D_{2D}$ is constant, independent of energy.\n\nThe sheet carrier density $n_{s}$ is found by integrating the product of the density of states and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function $f(E)$ over all energies, starting from the subband edge, which we set to $E=0$.\n$$n_{s} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} D_{2D}(E) f(E) dE$$\nThe problem specifies the degenerate limit, which corresponds to the zero-temperature ($T=0$) approximation. At $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac function is a step function: $f(E) = 1$ for $E \\le \\mu$ and $f(E) = 0$ for $E  \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the electrochemical potential (equivalent to the Fermi energy $E_F$ measured from the band edge).\nThe integral becomes:\n$$n_{s} = \\int_{0}^{\\mu} D_{2D} dE = D_{2D} \\int_{0}^{\\mu} dE = D_{2D} \\mu$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D_{2D}$:\n$$n_{s} = \\frac{g m^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\mu$$\nThe quantum capacitance per unit area $C_{Q}$ is defined as $C_{Q} = q^{2} \\frac{\\partial n_{s}}{\\partial \\mu}$. Taking the derivative of $n_{s}$ with respect to $\\mu$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial n_{s}}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\left(\\frac{g m^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\mu\\right) = \\frac{g m^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} = D_{2D}$$\nTherefore, the quantum capacitance is:\n$$C_{Q} = q^2 \\frac{g m^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Total Capacitance ($C$)**\n\nThe MOS capacitor in accumulation can be modeled as two capacitors in series: the oxide capacitance $C_{ox}$ and the quantum capacitance of the accumulation layer $C_{Q}$. When a small-signal gate voltage $dV_{G}$ is applied, it is partitioned across the oxide ($dV_{ox}$) and the semiconductor ($d\\psi_{s}$).\n$$dV_{G} = dV_{ox} + d\\psi_{s}$$\nThe total capacitance of the structure per unit area, $C$, is defined as $C = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{dV_{G}}$, where $dQ_{s}$ is the change in the sheet charge density in the accumulation layer.\nThe component capacitances relate the charge to the potential drops. The oxide capacitance is $C_{ox} = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{dV_{ox}}$. The potential change across the semiconductor, $d\\psi_{s}$, is related to the change in the electrochemical potential by $d\\mu = q d\\psi_{s}$. The quantum capacitance definition can be rewritten as:\n$$C_{Q} = q^2 \\frac{\\partial n_{s}}{\\partial \\mu} = q \\frac{\\partial (q n_{s})}{\\partial (q \\psi_{s})} = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{d\\psi_{s}}$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express the potential drops in terms of the charge change $dQ_{s}$:\n$$dV_{ox} = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{C_{ox}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d\\psi_{s} = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{C_{Q}}$$\nSubstituting these into the voltage partitioning equation:\n$$dV_{G} = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{dQ_{s}}{C_{Q}} = dQ_{s} \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{1}{C_{Q}}\\right)$$\nThe total capacitance is $C = \\frac{dQ_{s}}{dV_{G}}$, so by rearranging the above equation, we get the expression for the inverse of the total capacitance:\n$$\\frac{1}{C} = \\frac{dV_{G}}{dQ_{s}} = \\frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{1}{C_{Q}}$$\nThis is the characteristic formula for capacitors in series. The total capacitance is therefore:\n$$C = \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{ox}} + \\frac{1}{C_{Q}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{C_{ox}C_{Q}}{C_{ox}+C_{Q}}$$\nThe quantum capacitance $C_{Q}$ limits the total capacitance when it is the smaller of the two capacitances. In a series combination, the total capacitance is always less than the smallest individual capacitance. If $C_{Q} \\ll C_{ox}$, then the denominator $C_{ox} + C_{Q} \\approx C_{ox}$, and the total capacitance becomes $C \\approx \\frac{C_{ox}C_{Q}}{C_{ox}} = C_{Q}$. Thus, the quantum capacitance limits the total capacitance when $C_{Q}$ is significantly smaller than $C_{ox}$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Critical Oxide Thickness ($t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}}$)**\n\nThe critical oxide thickness $t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}}$ is the thickness at which the quantum capacitance equals the oxide capacitance, i.e., $C_{Q} = C_{ox}$.\nWe equate the expressions for $C_{Q}$ and $C_{ox}$:\n$$\\frac{q^2 g m^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{ox} \\varepsilon_{0}}{t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}}}$$\nSolving for $t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2 \\kappa_{ox} \\varepsilon_{0}}{q^2 g m^{\\star}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. First, we compute the total degeneracy $g$ and the effective mass $m^{\\star}$:\n$g = g_{s} g_{v} = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n$m^{\\star} = 0.19 \\, m_{0} = 0.19 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg}) = 1.7307829 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg}$.\n\nThe constants are:\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}$\n$\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n$\\kappa_{ox} = 3.9$\n$\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{F/m}$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{2\\pi(1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34})^2 (3.9) (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12})}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2 (4) (1.7307829 \\times 10^{-31})}$$\nNumerator:\n$$2\\pi(1.11212... \\times 10^{-68}) (3.45313... \\times 10^{-11}) = 2.41215... \\times 10^{-78} \\, \\text{J}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\cdot \\text{F/m}$$\nDenominator:\n$$(2.56696... \\times 10^{-38}) (4) (1.73078... \\times 10^{-31}) = 1.77740... \\times 10^{-68} \\, \\text{C}^2 \\cdot \\text{kg}$$\nDivision:\n$$t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{2.41215... \\times 10^{-78}}{1.77740... \\times 10^{-68}} \\, \\text{m} = 1.35711... \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}$$\nThe problem requests the answer in nanometers ($1 \\, \\text{nm} = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}$), rounded to three significant figures.\n$$t_{ox,\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.35711... \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} = 0.135711... \\, \\text{nm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.136 \\, \\text{nm}$.",
