This elegant approximation treats the donor electron and its host ion as a miniature hydrogen atom, but with its properties modified by the semiconductor crystal. This practice will guide you through deriving the donor binding energy, $E_{B}$, from first principles and then performing a sensitivity analysis to determine how it responds to changes in the material's effective mass, $m^*$, and relative permittivity, $\\epsilon_{r}$ .

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes the standard hydrogenic model for a shallow donor impurity in a semiconductor, which is a fundamental concept in solid-state physics. All required information and definitions are provided. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem starts with the time-independent Schrödinger equation for an electron in the presence of a screened Coulomb potential, within the effective mass approximation:\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m^{\\ast}} \\nabla^{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r} r}\\right] \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\, \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThis equation is mathematically analogous to the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom, which describes a single electron of mass $m_{e}$ orbiting a proton in a vacuum. The standard hydrogen atom equation is:\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{e}} \\nabla^{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} r}\\right] \\psi_{\\text{H}}(\\mathbf{r}) = E_{\\text{H}} \\, \\psi_{\\text{H}}(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe ground-state energy for the hydrogen atom is a well-known result from quantum mechanics, given by:\n$$\nE_{\\text{H},1} = - \\frac{m_{e} e^{4}}{2 (4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} \\hbar)^{2}} = - \\frac{m_{e} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the lowest energy eigenvalue, and its magnitude represents the ionization energy of hydrogen, approximately $13.6 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\nTo find the ground-state energy of the donor electron, we can use the result for the hydrogen atom by making the following substitutions based on the comparison of the two Schrödinger equations:\n1. The electron rest mass $m_{e}$ is replaced by the effective mass of the electron in the conduction band, $m^{\\ast}$.\n2. The permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_{0}$ is replaced by the total permittivity of the semiconductor medium, which is $\\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r}$.\n\nApplying these substitutions to the hydrogen ground-state energy formula gives the ground-state energy $E$ of the donor electron:\n$$\nE = - \\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} (\\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r})^{2} \\hbar^{2}} = - \\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\epsilon_{r}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nThe donor ground-state binding energy, $E_{B}$, is defined as the energy required to ionize the donor, which is the energy needed to move the electron from this bound state to the bottom of the conduction band (where its energy is taken as zero). Thus, $E_{B}$ is the magnitude of the ground-state energy $E$.\n$$\nE_{B} = |E| = \\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\epsilon_{r}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression shows the functional dependence of the binding energy on $m^{\\ast}$ and $\\epsilon_{r}$: $E_B \\propto m^{\\ast}$ and $E_B \\propto \\epsilon_{r}^{-2}$.\n\nNext, we must compute the differential fractional sensitivities, $S_{m^{\\ast}}$ and $S_{\\epsilon_{r}}$, defined as $S_{x} = \\partial (\\ln E_{B}) / \\partial (\\ln x)$.\nFirst, we take the natural logarithm of $E_{B}$:\n$$\n\\ln(E_{B}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m^{\\ast} e^{4}}{32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\epsilon_{r}^{2} \\hbar^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ln(E_{B}) = \\ln(m^{\\ast}) + \\ln(e^{4}) - \\ln(32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\hbar^{2}) - \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}^{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(E_{B}) = \\ln(m^{\\ast}) - 2 \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}) + C\n$$\nwhere $C = \\ln(e^{4}) - \\ln(32 \\pi^{2} \\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\hbar^{2})$ is a constant with respect to $m^{\\ast}$ and $\\epsilon_{r}$.\n\nThe sensitivity to $m^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\nS_{m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln E_{B})}{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})} \\left[\\ln(m^{\\ast}) - 2 \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}) + C\\right]\n$$\nSince $\\ln(m^{\\ast})$ and $\\ln(\\epsilon_{r})$ are independent variables, the partial derivative with respect to $\\ln(m^{\\ast})$ treats $\\ln(\\epsilon_{r})$ as a constant.\n$$\nS_{m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})}{\\partial (\\ln m^{\\ast})} - 0 + 0 = 1\n$$\nThe sensitivity to $\\epsilon_{r}$ is:\n$$\nS_{\\epsilon_{r}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln E_{B})}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})} \\left[\\ln(m^{\\ast}) - 2 \\ln(\\epsilon_{r}) + C\\right]\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\ln(\\epsilon_{r})$ treats $\\ln(m^{\\ast})$ as a constant.\n$$\nS_{\\epsilon_{r}} = 0 - 2 \\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon_{r})} + 0 = -2\n$$\nSo, we have $S_{m^{\\ast}} = 1$ and $S_{\\epsilon_{r}} = -2$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the first-order fractional change in $E_{B}$ due to small fractional changes in $m^{\\ast}$ and $\\epsilon_{r}$. The definition of sensitivity can be approximated for small changes:\n$$\nS_{x} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln E_{B})}{\\partial (\\ln x)} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta(\\ln E_{B})}{\\Delta(\\ln x)}\n$$\nFor a small fractional change $\\Delta x / x$, we have $\\Delta(\\ln x) = \\ln(x + \\Delta x) - \\ln(x) = \\ln(1 + \\Delta x / x) \\approx \\Delta x / x$. Thus, the sensitivity relates the fractional change in $E_B$ to the fractional change in $x$:\n$$\nS_x \\approx \\frac{\\Delta E_{B} / E_{B}}{\\Delta x / x} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\Delta E_B}{E_B} \\approx S_x \\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{x}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a fractional change of $\\pm 0.10$. Let this be $\\delta = \\pm 0.10$.\n\nFor a fractional change in effective mass, $\\Delta m^{\\ast} / m^{\\ast} = \\delta$:\nThe resulting first-order fractional change in $E_B$ is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_B}{E_B}\\right)_{m^{\\ast}} = S_{m^{\\ast}} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta m^{\\ast}}{m^{\\ast}}\\right) = (1)(\\delta) = \\delta = \\pm 0.10\n$$\nThe magnitude of this fractional change is $|(\\Delta E_B / E_B)_{m^{\\ast}}| = |\\pm 0.10| = 0.10$.\n\nFor a fractional change in relative permittivity, $\\Delta \\epsilon_{r} / \\epsilon_{r} = \\delta$:\nThe resulting first-order fractional change in $E_B$ is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_B}{E_B}\\right)_{\\epsilon_{r}} = S_{\\epsilon_{r}} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\epsilon_{r}}{\\epsilon_{r}}\\right) = (-2)(\\delta) = -2\\delta = \\mp 0.20\n$$\nThe magnitude of this fractional change is $|(\\Delta E_B / E_B)_{\\epsilon_{r}}| = |\\mp 0.20| = 0.20$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of these magnitudes, specifically the magnitude due to the $\\epsilon_{r}$ change divided by the magnitude due to the $m^{\\ast}$ change.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\left|\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_B}{E_B}\\right)_{\\epsilon_{r}}\\right|}{\\left|\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_B}{E_B}\\right)_{m^{\\ast}}\\right|} = \\frac{0.20}{0.10} = 2\n$$\nThe ratio is a pure number, $2$. This indicates that the binding energy is twice as sensitive to fractional changes in the relative permittivity as it is to fractional changes in the effective mass.",

            "solution": "The task is to determine the equilibrium Fermi level, $E_F$, in crystalline silicon at a temperature $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for various compensated doping concentrations. The solution must account for the incomplete ionization of donor atoms.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the equilibrium state of a semiconductor is charge neutrality. The total charge density, $\\rho$, must be zero. The charge density is composed of contributions from mobile positive charges (holes, $p$), mobile negative charges (electrons, $n$), fixed positive charges (ionized donors, $N_D^+$), and fixed negative charges (ionized acceptors, $N_A^-$). The charge neutrality condition is stated as:\n$$ \\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-) = 0 $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge. This simplifies to the particle balance equation:\n$$ p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^- $$\nTo solve for $E_F$, we must express each term in this equation as a function of $E_F$.\n\n1.  **Free Carrier Concentrations:** The problem specifies that non-degenerate carrier statistics apply. Therefore, the electron concentration $n$ in the conduction band and the hole concentration $p$ in the valence band can be described by the Boltzmann approximation:\n    $$ n(E_F) = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n    $$ p(E_F) = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n    Here, $N_c$ and $N_v$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. $E_C$ and $E_V$ are the energies of the conduction and valence band edges. $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n2.  **Ionized Acceptor Concentration:** The problem states that shallow acceptors are to be considered fully ionized at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This implies that every acceptor atom has captured an electron, becoming a fixed negative charge. Thus, the concentration of ionized acceptors, $N_A^-$, is equal to the total acceptor doping concentration, $N_A$:\n    $$ N_A^- = N_A $$\n\n3.  **Ionized Donor Concentration:** The problem requires that incomplete ionization of donors be taken into account. The ionization of donors is governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics for the discrete donor energy level $E_D$. The probability that a donor level is occupied by an electron (i.e., the donor is neutral) is given by:\n    $$ f_D(E_D) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\n    The term $g_D$ is the degeneracy factor of the donor level, given as $g_D = 2$. This factor accounts for the two possible spin states of an electron occupying the donor site. The concentration of ionized donors, $N_D^+$, is the total donor concentration $N_D$ multiplied by the probability that a donor state is empty (unoccupied), which is $1 - f_D(E_D)$:\n    $$ N_D^+(E_F) = N_D \\left[ 1 - f_D(E_D) \\right] = N_D \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{g_D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)} \\right] $$\n    Through algebraic simplification, this yields the standard expression for the ionized donor concentration:\n    $$ N_D^+(E_F) = \\frac{N_D}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\n\nBy substituting these expressions for $p$, $n$, $N_A^-$, and $N_D^+$ into the charge neutrality equation, we obtain a single non-linear equation in the unknown variable $E_F$:\n$$ N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right) + \\frac{N_D}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) + N_A $$\nTo solve this equation numerically, we define a function $f(E_F)$ whose root corresponds to the equilibrium Fermi level:\n$$ f(E_F) = p(E_F) - n(E_F) + N_D^+(E_F) - N_A = 0 $$\n$$ f(E_F) = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right) - N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) + \\frac{N_D}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)} - N_A = 0 $$\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_B = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$, which gives $k_B T \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $E_V = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $E_g = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, which implies $E_C = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- The donor level is at $E_D = E_C - 0.045\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.045\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.075\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- The donor degeneracy factor is $g_D = 2$\n- The effective densities of states are $N_c = 2.8 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $N_v = 1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n\nThe function $f(E_F)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $E_F$ over the physically meaningful domain $[E_V, E_C]$. At the lower bound $E_F = E_V$, the hole term $p$ is large and positive, making $f(E_V)>0$. At the upper bound $E_F = E_C$, the electron term $n$ is large and negative, making $f(E_C)0$. This guarantees the existence of a unique root within the bandgap. This root can be efficiently found using a numerical method like Brent's method.\n\nThe algorithmic approach is to:\n1.  Implement the function $f(E_F)$ in software.\n2.  For each test case defined by a pair of doping concentrations $(N_D, N_A)$, use a root-finding algorithm to solve $f(E_F)=0$ for $E_F$ within the search interval $[0, 1.12]\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.

The dimensionless variational energy is $\\tilde{E}(\\tilde{a}) = \\langle\\psi_{norm}|\\tilde{H}|\\psi_{norm}\\rangle$.\n    The kinetic energy expectation value is $\\langle -\\tilde{\\nabla}^2 \\rangle = 1/\\tilde{a}^2$.\n    The potential energy expectation value is:\n    $$ \\langle V \\rangle = \\int \\psi_{norm}^* \\left( -\\frac{2}{\\tilde{r}} e^{-\\tilde{r}/\\tilde{L}_D} \\right) \\psi_{norm} \\, d\\tilde{V} = \\frac{-8}{\\tilde{a}^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\tilde{r} e^{-\\tilde{r}(2/\\tilde{a} + 1/\\tilde{L}_D)} d\\tilde{r} $$\n    Using the integral $\\int_0^\\infty x e^{-bx} dx = 1/b^2$, we get:\n    $$ \\langle V \\rangle = \\frac{-8}{\\tilde{a}^3} \\frac{1}{(2/\\tilde{a} + 1/\\tilde{L}_D)^2} = \\frac{-8 \\tilde{a}^2 \\tilde{L}_D^2}{\\tilde{a}^3 (2\\tilde{L}_D + \\tilde{a})^2} = -\\frac{8 \\tilde{L}_D^2}{\\tilde{a}(2\\tilde{L}_D + \\tilde{a})^2} $$\n    The total dimensionless energy is:\n    $$ \\tilde{E}(\\tilde{a}, \\tilde{L}_D) = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}^2} - \\frac{8 \\tilde{L}_D^2}{\\tilde{a}(2\\tilde{L}_D + \\tilde{a})^2} $$\n\n2.  **Variational Minimization for $L_D = a_B^*$**:\n    This case corresponds to $\\tilde{L}_D = 1$. The energy expression simplifies to:\n    $$ \\tilde{E}(\\tilde{a}) = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}^2} - \\frac{8}{\\tilde{a}(2 + \\tilde{a})^2} $$\n    To find the minimum, we set the derivative with respect to $\\tilde{a}$ to zero:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\tilde{E}}{d\\tilde{a}} = -\\frac{2}{\\tilde{a}^3} - 8 \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}^2 (2+\\tilde{a})^2} - \\frac{2}{\\tilde{a}(2+\\tilde{a})^3} \\right) = 0 $$\n    $$ -\\frac{2}{\\tilde{a}^3} + \\frac{8}{\\tilde{a}^2 (2+\\tilde{a})^2} + \\frac{16}{\\tilde{a}(2+\\tilde{a})^3} = 0 $$\n    Multiplying by $\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{a}^3(2+\\tilde{a})^3$ gives:\n    $$ -(2+\\tilde{a})^3 + 4\\tilde{a}(2+\\tilde{a}) + 8\\tilde{a}^2 = 0 $$\n    $$ -(8 + 12\\tilde{a} + 6\\tilde{a}^2 + \\tilde{a}^3) + (8\\tilde{a} + 4\\tilde{a}^2) + 8\\tilde{a}^2 = 0 $$\n    $$ -\\tilde{a}^3 + 6\\tilde{a}^2 - 4\\tilde{a} - 8 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tilde{a}^3 - 6\\tilde{a}^2 + 4\\tilde{a} + 8 = 0 $$\n    By inspection (or the rational root theorem), we find that $\\tilde{a}=2$ is a root: $2^3 - 6(2^2) + 4(2) + 8 = 8 - 24 + 8 + 8 = 0$.\n    The value of the variational parameter that minimizes the energy is $a_{\\min} = 2 a_B^*$. Substituting this back into the energy expression:\n    $$ \\tilde{E}_{\\min} = \\tilde{E}(2) = \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{8}{2(2+2)^2} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{8}{32} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = 0 $$\n    So, the estimated ground-state energy for the screened case is $E_{\\min}(L_D=a_B^*) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Binding Energy Calculation**:\n    The binding energy for the screened case is:\n    $$ E_B(L_D=a_B^*) = \\max\\{-E_{\\min}(L_D=a_B^*), 0\\} = \\max\\{0, 0\\} = 0 $$\n    For the unscreened case, $L_D \\to \\infty$ ($\\tilde{L}_D \\to \\infty$). The energy expression becomes the standard hydrogenic one:\n    $$ \\tilde{E}(\\tilde{a}) = \\lim_{\\tilde{L}_D \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}^2} - \\frac{8 \\tilde{L}_D^2}{\\tilde{a}(2\\tilde{L}_D + \\tilde{a})^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}^2} - \\frac{8}{\\tilde{a}(2)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{a}^2} - \\frac{2}{\\tilde{a}} $$\n    Minimizing gives $\\frac{d\\tilde{E}}{d\\tilde{a}} = -2/\\tilde{a}^3 + 2/\\tilde{a}^2 = 0 \\implies \\tilde{a}=1$. The minimum energy is $\\tilde{E}_{\\min} = 1-2 = -1$.\n    Thus, $E_{\\min}(0) = -R^*$. The unscreened binding energy is:\n    $$ E_B(0) = \\max\\{-E_{\\min}(0), 0\\} = \\max\\{-(-R^*), 0\\} = R^* $$\n\n4.  **Reduction Fraction**:\n    Finally, we compute the reduction fraction $\\delta$:\n    $$ \\delta = \\frac{E_{B}(0) - E_{B}(L_D=a_B^*)}{E_{B}(0)} = \\frac{R^* - 0}{R^*} = 1 $$\n    This result indicates that for this variational model, the binding energy is completely eliminated when the screening length equals the effective Bohr radius.",
