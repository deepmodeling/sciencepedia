The parameters and conditions are unambiguous.\n- **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained.

A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Part (a): Analysis of the approximation $n \\approx n_{i}$\nWe begin with the charge neutrality condition for an uncompensated, n-type semiconductor, assuming complete ionization of shallow donors ($N_D^+ = N_D$):\n$$n - p = N_{D}$$\nThe mass-action law in thermal equilibrium states that $np = n_{i}^{2}$. We can express the hole concentration $p$ as $p = n_{i}^{2}/n$. Substituting this into the neutrality equation yields:\n$$n - \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n} = N_{D}$$\nMultiplying by $n$ and rearranging gives a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$:\n$$n^{2} - N_{D}n - n_{i}^{2} = 0$$\nThis equation governs the electron concentration in terms of the donor concentration $N_{D}$ and the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}(T)$. The physically valid solution (since concentration must be positive) is obtained from the quadratic formula:\n$$n = \\frac{-(-N_{D}) + \\sqrt{(-N_{D})^{2} - 4(1)(-n_{i}^{2})}}{2(1)} = \\frac{N_{D} + \\sqrt{N_{D}^{2} + 4n_{i}^{2}}}{2}$$\nWe wish to find the conditions under which the approximation $n \\approx n_{i}$ is valid. This approximation implies that the semiconductor behaves as if it were intrinsic, despite the presence of dopants. Let's analyze the exact solution for $n$.\nThe expression can be rewritten as:\n$$n = n_{i} \\left( \\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}}\\right)^{2} + 1} \\right)$$\nFor $n$ to be approximately equal to $n_{i}$, the term $\\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}}$ must be much smaller than $1$. Let's denote $x = \\frac{N_{D}}{2n_{i}}$. The condition is $x \\ll 1$. In this case, we can use the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+x^2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. However, substituting this back into the expression for $n$ gives $n \\approx n_i(x + 1 + x^2/2) = n_i + N_D/2 + N_D^2/(8n_i)$, which is a bit complex.\n\nA more direct approach is to consider the limit $N_D \\ll 2n_i$ in the original solution for $n$. If $N_D$ is small, then $N_D^2$ is much smaller than $4n_i^2$. The term under the square root becomes $\\sqrt{N_{D}^{2} + 4n_{i}^{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{4n_{i}^{2}} = 2n_{i}$.\nSubstituting this approximation into the solution for $n$:\n$$n \\approx \\frac{N_{D} + 2n_{i}}{2} = n_{i} + \\frac{N_{D}}{2}$$\nFor the approximation $n \\approx n_i$ to hold, the second term, $\\frac{N_{D}}{2}$, must be negligible compared to $n_{i}$. This leads to the condition:\n$$\\frac{N_{D}}{2} \\ll n_{i} \\quad \\text{or simply} \\quad N_{D} \\ll n_{i}(T)$$\nIn conclusion, the approximation that the electron concentration $n$ is nearly equal to the intrinsic concentration $n_i$ is valid when the donor concentration $N_{D}$ is substantially smaller than the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i(T)$. Since $n_{i}(T)$ is a strong, exponentially increasing function of temperature $T$, for any lightly doped sample (fixed $N_D$), there is a sufficiently high temperature range where this condition is met and the semiconductor behaves intrinsically. This requires the assumption that donors are completely ionized, which is typically true at these higher temperatures.\n\n### Part (b): Calculation of $N_{D,\\max}$ at $T = 450\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nThe criterion for the approximation is given as $\\frac{|n - n_{i}|}{n_{i}} \\leq \\delta$, where $\\delta = 0.01$. Since doping is n-type ($N_D > 0$), the electron concentration $n$ will be greater than $n_i$. Thus, $|n - n_{i}| = n - n_{i}$. The criterion becomes:\n$$\\frac{n - n_{i}}{n_{i}} \\leq \\delta \\implies n \\leq (1+\\delta)n_{i}$$\nTo find the maximum donor concentration $N_{D,\\max}$ that satisfies this, we use the relationship between $n$, $N_D$, and $n_i$ derived from charge neutrality and mass action:\n$$N_{D} = n - p = n - \\frac{n_{i}^{2}}{n}$$\n$N_{D}$ is an increasing function of $n$ for $n > n_i$. Therefore, $N_{D,\\max}$ corresponds to the maximum allowed value of $n$, which is $n = (1+\\delta)n_{i}$. Substituting this into the equation for $N_D$:\n$$N_{D,\\max} = (1+\\delta)n_i - \\frac{n_i^2}{(1+\\delta)n_i} = n_i \\left( (1+\\delta) - \\frac{1}{1+\\delta} \\right)$$\n$$N_{D,\\max} = n_i \\left( \\frac{(1+\\delta)^2 - 1}{1+\\delta} \\right) = n_i \\left( \\frac{1 + 2\\delta + \\delta^2 - 1}{1+\\delta} \\right) = n_i \\frac{2\\delta + \\delta^2}{1+\\delta}$$\nNow we must calculate $n_i(T)$ at $T = 450\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nFirst, calculate the bandgap $E_{g}$ at $T = 450\\,\\mathrm{K}$ using the Varshni relation:\n$$E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = E_{g0} - \\frac{\\alpha T^{2}}{T+\\beta} = 1.17\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{(4.73\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) (450\\,\\mathrm{K})^{2}}{450\\,\\mathrm{K} + 636\\,\\mathrm{K}}$$\n$$E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.17 - \\frac{4.73\\times 10^{-4} \\times 202500}{1086}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.17 - \\frac{95.7825}{1086}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n$$E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 1.17 - 0.0881975 = 1.0818025\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nNext, calculate the effective densities of states $N_c$ and $N_v$ at $T=450\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$N_{c}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = N_{c}(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{K}}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{3/2} = (2.80\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(1.5)^{1.5} \\approx 5.1439\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$N_{v}(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = N_{v}(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{K}}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{3/2} = (1.04\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(1.5)^{1.5} \\approx 1.9106\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nNow calculate the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$:\n$$n_i(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\sqrt{N_{c}(450\\,\\mathrm{K})N_{v}(450\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{g}(450\\,\\mathrm{K})}{2k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe term in the exponent is:\n$$\\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}T} = \\frac{1.0818025\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2 \\times (8.617333\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (450\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{1.0818025}{0.077556} \\approx 13.9486$$\nThe pre-exponential factor is:\n$$\\sqrt{N_{c}N_{v}} = \\sqrt{(5.1439\\times 10^{19})(1.9106\\times 10^{19})}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\approx \\sqrt{9.8273\\times 10^{38}}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\approx 3.1349\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nSo, the intrinsic concentration is:\n$$n_i(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx (3.1349\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\exp(-13.9486) \\approx (3.1349\\times 10^{19})(8.756\\times 10^{-7})\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n$$n_i(450\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2.7449\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nFinally, we can calculate $N_{D,\\max}$ using $\\delta = 0.01$ and the derived formula:\n$$N_{D,\\max} = n_i \\frac{2(0.01) + (0.01)^2}{1+0.01} = n_i \\frac{0.0201}{1.01} \\approx n_i(0.019901)$$\n$$N_{D,\\max} \\approx (2.7449\\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) (0.019901) \\approx 5.4627\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nRounding the answer to three significant figures, we get $5.46 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.",

Even if electrons are moderately degenerate, the correction enters only through $F_{1/2}(\\eta)$ and does not overcome the dominant exponential dependence on $E_{g}/(k_{B}T)$, so the mass action prediction of extremely small $p$ remains valid across a wide temperature range.",

In the principal axes of each valley, the dispersion is $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_l^2}{m_l} + \\frac{k_{t1}^2}{m_t} + \\frac{k_{t2}^2}{m_t}\\right)$, where $m_l$ and $m_t$ are the longitudinal and transverse band-edge effective masses of the valley, and $E_c$ is the conduction-band edge. The crystal is uniformly $n$-type doped such that the Fermi level satisfies $E_F - E_c \\gg k_B T$ at $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ (degenerate statistics). Assume elastic, isotropic momentum relaxation characterized by an energy-independent relaxation time $\\tau$ in the low-field regime, and neglect band nonparabolicity.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of the density of states, equilibrium occupation under Fermi-Dirac statistics, and Drude-type low-field transport, determine which effective mass governs the equilibrium electron concentration and which effective mass governs low-field conductivity in this degenerate regime. For a silicon-like case with $g_v = 6$, $m_l = 0.916\\,m_0$, and $m_t = 0.190\\,m_0$, identify the correct statements about the definitions and numerical values of these two masses and their roles.\n\nChoose the single best option:\n\nA. The equilibrium electron concentration is governed by a density-of-states effective mass equal to the geometric mean of the principal masses, and the low-field conductivity is governed by a conductivity effective mass defined by a directional harmonic average of the inverse principal masses. For silicon with the given parameters, the density-of-states effective mass is approximately $0.32\\,m_0$, and the conductivity effective mass is approximately $0.26\\,m_0$. Degenerate statistics change the occupation via Fermi-Dirac integrals but do not change which mass enters which quantity.\n\nB. Under degenerate conditions, the conductivity effective mass replaces the density-of-states mass in the effective density of states, because transport-weighted high-energy states dominate. Therefore, the equilibrium electron concentration is governed by the conductivity mass, yielding approximately $0.26\\,m_0$ in silicon, while transport is governed by the density-of-states mass, approximately $0.32\\,m_0$.\n\nC. For any parabolic band, the density-of-states and conductivity effective masses are identical and equal to the transverse mass; thus both equilibrium concentration and conductivity are governed by $m_t$ for silicon.\n\nD. The mass entering transport is the geometric mean of the principal masses because it maximizes the number of available states, while the mass entering the effective density of states is the harmonic average because it weights inverse masses; for silicon this yields approximately $0.26\\,m_0$ for the density-of-states mass and $0.32\\,m_0$ for the conductivity mass.",

A solution will be derived based on fundamental principles.\n\n### Derivation of Effective Masses\n\n**1. Density-of-States Effective Mass ($m_d^*$ or $m_{dos}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium electron concentration, $n$, is determined by the integral of the density of states, $g(E)$, multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac occupation probability, $f(E)$:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^\\infty g(E) f(E) dE$$\nThe density of states is derived by counting the number of states in $k$-space per unit energy. For a single valley, the number of states (including spin degeneracy) within a volume $V_k$ in $k$-space is $N_k = 2 V_k / (2\\pi)^3$. The surface of constant energy $\\mathcal{E} = E - E_c$ is an ellipsoid defined by $\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_l^2}{m_l} + \\frac{k_{t1}^2}{m_t} + \\frac{k_{t2}^2}{m_t}\\right)$.\n\nThe volume of this ellipsoid is $V_k(\\mathcal{E}) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{2\\mathcal{E}}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{m_l m_t m_t}$.\nThe cumulative number of states up to energy $E$ for a single valley is:\n$$N_1(E) = \\frac{2}{(2\\pi)^3} V_k(E-E_c) = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2(E-E_c)}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} (m_l m_t^2)^{1/2}$$\nThe density of states for a single valley is $g_1(E) = \\frac{dN_1(E)}{dE}$:\n$$g_1(E) = \\frac{(m_l m_t^2)^{1/2} \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E-E_c}$$\nTo define an effective mass, we compare this to the DOS for a standard isotropic parabolic band, $g_{iso}(E) = \\frac{(m^*)^{3/2} \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E-E_c}$. Equating $g_1(E)$ and $g_{iso}(E)$, we find the density-of-states effective mass per valley:\n$$(m_d^*)^{3/2} = (m_l m_t^2)^{1/2} \\implies m_d^* = (m_l m_t^2)^{1/3}$$\nThis is the geometric mean of the three principal effective masses. The total density of states for the semiconductor is $g(E) = g_v \\cdot g_1(E)$. The quantity $m_d^*$ is the fundamental mass parameter that characterizes the density of states.\nFor the silicon-like case:\n$$m_d^* = (0.916\\,m_0 \\cdot (0.190\\,m_0)^2)^{1/3} = m_0 (0.916 \\cdot 0.0361)^{1/3} = m_0 (0.0330676)^{1/3} \\approx 0.321\\,m_0$$\nThe equilibrium concentration $n$ is governed by this mass. The fact that the statistics are degenerate ($E_F - E_c \\gg k_B T$) changes the occupation function $f(E)$ to a step function, altering the result of the integral for $n$, but it does not change the underlying $g(E)$ or the definition of $m_d^*$.\n\n**2. Conductivity Effective Mass ($m_c^*$ or $m_{cond}$)**\n\nLow-field conductivity is given by the Drude-like expression $\\sigma = n e \\mu$. The mobility $\\mu$ depends on the effective mass and scattering time $\\tau$. For an anisotropic band, the response to an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is tensorial. In the principal axes of a single valley, the inverse effective mass tensor is:\n$$\\mathbf{M}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/m_l & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/m_t & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/m_t \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe conductivity tensor for one valley is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{valley} = \\frac{n_v e^2 \\tau}{1} \\mathbf{M}^{-1}$, where $n_v = n/g_v$ is the electron density per valley.\nThe total conductivity of the crystal is the sum of contributions from all valleys. For silicon ($g_v=6$), the valleys are oriented along the $\\pm x, \\pm y, \\pm z$ axes (crystal axes). We must average the conductivity tensors of all valleys. Due to the cubic symmetry of the crystal, the total conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ becomes isotropic, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. The scalar conductivity $\\sigma$ is given by any of the diagonal elements, for example, $\\sigma_{xx}$.\n$$\\sigma = \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{total}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{g_v} \\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{valley,i})$$\nFor each valley, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{valley,i}) = \\frac{n_v e^2 \\tau}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{1}{m_t} + \\frac{1}{m_t}\\right)$.\nSo, $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{3} g_v \\left[ \\frac{n}{g_v} e^2 \\tau \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right)$.\nWe define the conductivity effective mass $m_c^*$ via the isotropic Drude formula $\\sigma = \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{m_c^*}$. Comparing these expressions gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{m_c^*} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{m_l} + \\frac{2}{m_t}\\right)$$\nThis shows that $m_c^*$ is derived from a harmonic average of the inverse principal masses, averaged over the equivalent crystal directions.\nFor the silicon-like case:\n$$\\frac{1}{m_c^*} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{0.916\\,m_0} + \\frac{2}{0.190\\,m_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3m_0} \\left(1.0917 + 10.5263\\right) = \\frac{11.618}{3m_0} \\approx \\frac{3.873}{m_0}$$\n$$m_c^* = \\frac{m_0}{3.873} \\approx 0.258\\,m_0$$\nThe assumption of an energy-independent $\\tau$ and parabolic bands means this result holds regardless of whether the statistics are degenerate or non-degenerate. Transport involves an average over all carriers, and this effective mass represents the appropriate average for the entire electron population $n$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The equilibrium electron concentration is governed by a density-of-states effective mass equal to the geometric mean of the principal masses, and the low-field conductivity is governed by a conductivity effective mass defined by a directional harmonic average of the inverse principal masses. For silicon with the given parameters, the density-of-states effective mass is approximately $0.32\\,m_0$, and the conductivity effective mass is approximately $0.26\\,m_0$. Degenerate statistics change the occupation via Fermi-Dirac integrals but do not change which mass enters which quantity.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivations.\n-   $m_d^* = (m_l m_t^2)^{1/3}$ is the geometric mean.\n-   $1/m_c^* = \\frac{1}{3}(1/m_l + 2/m_t)$ is the directional harmonic average.\n-   Calculated values are $m_d^* \\approx 0.32\\,m_0$ and $m_c^* \\approx 0.26\\,m_0$.\n-   The role of the masses is independent of the statistics under the stated assumptions.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under degenerate conditions, the conductivity effective mass replaces the density-of-states mass in the effective density of states, because transport-weighted high-energy states dominate. Therefore, the equilibrium electron concentration is governed by the conductivity mass, yielding approximately $0.26\\,m_0$ in silicon, while transport is governed by the density-of-states mass, approximately $0.32\\,m_0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The density of states is an intrinsic property of the band structure and is not altered by occupation statistics. It confuses and swaps the roles of the two effective masses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For any parabolic band, the density-of-states and conductivity effective masses are identical and equal to the transverse mass; thus both equilibrium concentration and conductivity are governed by $m_t$ for silicon.**\nThis is incorrect. The two masses are identical only for an isotropic band ($m_l = m_t$), not for any parabolic band. For silicon, $m_l \\neq m_t$, and our calculations show $m_d^* \\neq m_c^*$. Neither mass is equal to $m_t = 0.190\\,m_0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The mass entering transport is the geometric mean of the principal masses because it maximizes the number of available states, while the mass entering the effective density of states is the harmonic average because it weights inverse masses; for silicon this yields approximately $0.26\\,m_0$ for the density-of-states mass and $0.32\\,m_0$ for the conductivity mass.**\nThis statement incorrectly swaps the definitions and roles of the two masses. The geometric mean ($m_d^*$) governs the density of states, while the harmonic average ($m_c^*$) governs transport (conductivity). The numerical values are also assigned to the wrong quantities.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
