            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between electron concentration $n$ and the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ for a three-dimensional free electron gas at temperature $T=0$, and then to use this relationship to calculate $k_F$ for a given electron concentration.\n\nThe analysis begins by considering the allowed quantum states for a free electron in a cubic crystal of side length $L$ and volume $V = L^3$. We impose Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), which stipulate that the wavefunction must be periodic with the lattice, i.e., $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$, and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ directions. The solutions to the free-particle Schrödinger equation under these conditions are plane waves of the form $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe PBC quantize the allowed components of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The conditions require:\n$$k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_x, \\quad k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_y, \\quad k_z = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_z$$\nwhere $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are any integers. These allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors form a uniform grid in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The separation between adjacent points along any axis is $\\frac{2\\pi}{L}$. The volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space associated with each single allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-state is:\n$$\\Delta V_k = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}$$\n\nAt absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy all available single-particle energy states up to the Fermi energy $E_F$. For an isotropic dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m_e^*}$, this means all states with a wavevector magnitude $|\\mathbf{k}|$ less than or equal to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ are filled. These occupied states form a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, known as the Fermi sphere, with a radius of $k_F$.\n\nThe volume of this Fermi sphere is:\n$$V_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$$\n\nThe total number of orbital states, $N_{states}$, within the Fermi sphere is found by dividing the volume of the Fermi sphere by the volume per state, $\\Delta V_k$.\n$$N_{states} = \\frac{V_k}{\\Delta V_k} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{\\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}} = \\frac{4\\pi k_F^3 V}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}$$\n\nThe problem states there is a two-fold spin degeneracy, meaning each orbital state (defined by a unique $\\mathbf{k}$) can be occupied by two electrons (one with spin up, one with spin down). Therefore, the total number of electrons, $N$, is twice the number of occupied orbital states.\n$$N = 2 \\times N_{states} = 2 \\times \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}$$\n\nThe electron concentration $n$ is defined as the total number of electrons per unit volume, $n = N/V$.\n$$n = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2} \\right) = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}$$\nThis is the required closed-form relationship between the electron concentration $n$ and the Fermi wavevector $k_F$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate $k_F$ for a heavily doped silicon sample with an electron concentration of $n = 3.0 \\times 10^{20}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. First, we rearrange the derived relationship to solve for $k_F$:\n$$k_F^3 = 3\\pi^2 n$$\n$$k_F = (3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3}$$\n\nThe final answer for $k_F$ must be in units of inverse nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$). We must convert the given concentration $n$ to units of $\\mathrm{nm}^{-3}$.\nWe know that $1\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^7\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. Therefore, $1\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3 = (10^7\\ \\mathrm{nm})^3 = 10^{21}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^3$.\nThe concentration is:\n$$n = 3.0 \\times 10^{20}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{20}}{(1\\ \\mathrm{cm})^3} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{20}}{(10^7\\ \\mathrm{nm})^3} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{20}}{10^{21}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^3} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-3}$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $n$ into the expression for $k_F$:\n$$k_F = (3\\pi^2 \\times 0.30\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-3})^{1/3} = (0.90\\pi^2\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-3})^{1/3}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$k_F = (0.90 \\times (3.14159...)^2)^{1/3}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\n$$k_F \\approx (0.90 \\times 9.8696044)^{1/3}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\n$$k_F \\approx (8.88264396)^{1/3}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\n$$k_F \\approx 2.070861\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$k_F \\approx 2.071\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$",

Total mobility is a weighted average of valley mobilities, weighted by carrier population ($\\mu = (\\sum n_i \\mu_i) / n_{\\text{tot}}$). A single-valley model would use single \"effective\" parameters ($m^*_{\\text{eff}}$, $\\tau_{\\text{eff}}$), obscuring the parallel conduction mechanism.\n\n**Outcome:** The numerical results show that Valley 1, with its very light effective mass, has extremely high mobility and dominates the total conductivity ($\\sigma_1 \\approx 98\\%$ of $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}$) despite having only 60% of the electrons. The other valleys contribute very little. A single-valley model using simple averaged parameters would fail to capture this disproportionate contribution from the high-mobility channel and would drastically underestimate the overall conductivity.",
