We impose Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), which stipulate that the wavefunction must be periodic with the lattice, i.e., $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$, and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ directions. The solutions to the free-particle Schrödinger equation under these conditions are plane waves of the form $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe PBC quantize the allowed components of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The conditions require:\n$$k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_x, \\quad k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_y, \\quad k_z = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_z$$\nwhere $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are any integers.

The volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space associated with each single allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-state is:\n$$\\Delta V_k = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}$$\n\nAt absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy all available single-particle energy states up to the Fermi energy $E_F$. For an isotropic dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m_e^*}$, this means all states with a wavevector magnitude $|\\mathbf{k}|$ less than or equal to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ are filled. These occupied states form a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, known as the Fermi sphere, with a radius of $k_F$.\n\nThe volume of this Fermi sphere is:\n$$V_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$$\n\nThe total number of orbital states, $N_{states}$, within the Fermi sphere is found by dividing the volume of the Fermi sphere by the volume per state, $\\Delta V_k$.\n$$N_{states} = \\frac{V_k}{\\Delta V_k} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{\\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}} = \\frac{4\\pi k_F^3 V}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}$$\n\nThe problem states there is a two-fold spin degeneracy, meaning each orbital state (defined by a unique $\\mathbf{k}$) can be occupied by two electrons (one with spin up, one with spin down).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the threshold electron density for degeneracy in a heavily doped semiconductor, modeled as a three-dimensional noninteracting electron gas with a parabolic and isotropic conduction band.\n\nFirst, we derive the density of states, $g(E)$. We begin by counting the allowed quantum states in $k$-space.

We must also account for the degeneracies. The total degeneracy is the product of the spin degeneracy, $g_s=2$, and the valley degeneracy, $g_v$. The problem states that spin degeneracy is implicitly accounted for, which we take to mean the standard factor of $2$ is included.\n\nThe total number of states is:\n$$\nN(k) = g_s g_v \\frac{\\text{Volume of } k\\text{-sphere}}{\\text{Volume per state}} = (2 g_v) \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k^3}{\\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}} = g_v V \\frac{k^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe density of states in $k$-space per unit volume of the crystal is $\\mathcal{N}(k) = \\frac{N(k)}{V} = g_v \\frac{k^3}{3\\pi^2}$.\n\nTo find the density of states per unit energy, $g(E)$, we use the relationship $g(E) = \\frac{d\\mathcal{N}}{dE}$. Using the chain rule, $g(E) = \\frac{d\\mathcal{N}}{dk} \\frac{dk}{dE}$.\nFirst, we find $\\frac{d\\mathcal{N}}{dk}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{N}}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk}\\left(g_v \\frac{k^3}{3\\pi^2}\\right) = g_v \\frac{k^2}{\\pi^2}\n$$\nNext, we find $\\frac{dk}{dE}$ from the given parabolic dispersion relation, $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$, where $E$ is the energy measured from the conduction band minimum.\nFrom the dispersion relation, we have $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*E}}{\\hbar}$.

In this limit ($k_B T \\ll E_F$), the Fermi-Dirac distribution function approaches a step function: $f(E) \\approx 1$ for $E < E_F$ and $f(E) \\approx 0$ for $E > E_F$. This corresponds to the low-temperature limit ($T \\to 0$), where all states up to the Fermi energy are occupied.

That is, $E_F \\gg k_B T$. A non-degenerate gas, which obeys Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, corresponds to the opposite limit. The problem defines the threshold for degeneracy by the condition $E_F = \\alpha k_B T$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless parameter typically greater than $1$ (e.g., $\\alpha=3$ or $\\alpha=5$ for strong degeneracy).\n\nTo find the threshold electron density $n_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$, we substitute the condition $E_F = \\alpha k_B T$ into our expression for $n$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{th}}(T) = \\frac{g_v}{3\\pi^2} \\left(\\frac{2m^* (\\alpha k_B T)}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the threshold density as a function of temperature.\n\nThe validity of this model for a heavily doped semiconductor rests on several physical conditions:\n1.  **Parabolic Band:** The model assumes $E \\propto k^2$. This is only accurate near the minimum of the conduction band (e.g., the $\\Gamma$-valley for GaAs). The Fermi energy must be small compared to the energy separation to higher, non-parabolic parts of the band or to other energy valleys (L, X valleys).\n2.  **Effective Mass:** This concept is a direct consequence of the parabolic band approximation and encapsulates the influence of the periodic crystal potential on electron dynamics. Its validity is tied to the validity of the parabolic approximation.\n3.  **Heavy Doping:** The dopant concentration must be high enough to produce an electron density $n$ that satisfies $n \\ge n_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$, pushing the Fermi level well into the conduction band and justifying the degenerate approximation.\n4.  **Homogeneous Medium/Plane Waves:** This approximation neglects scattering from the random potential of ionized dopants. It is justified if the Fermi wavelength $\\lambda_F = 2\\pi/k_F$ is much smaller than the average distance between dopants, and if the potential fluctuations are slow on the scale of $\\lambda_F$. Strong screening in a dense electron gas helps to smooth out these potentials, lending support to this approximation.\n5.  **Non-interacting Gas:** Electron-electron Coulomb interactions are neglected. In a high-density gas, these interactions are significantly screened, making the average kinetic energy ($E_F$) much larger than the average potential energy of interaction. This justifies treating the electrons as an ideal gas.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $n_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$ for gallium arsenide (GaAs) using the given parameters:\n-   $m^{*} = 0.067 \\, m_{e} = 0.067 \\times (9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 6.103287 \\times 10^{-32}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n-   $g_{v} = 1$\n-   $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n-   $\\alpha = 5$\n-   $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n-   $\\hbar = 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s}$\n\nWe calculate the argument of the power term first:\n$$\n\\frac{2m^* \\alpha k_B T}{\\hbar^2} = \\frac{2 \\times (6.103287 \\times 10^{-32}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times 5 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{2m^* \\alpha k_B T}{\\hbar^2} \\approx \\frac{2.52834 \\times 10^{-51}\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot J}}{1.11212 \\times 10^{-68}\\,\\mathrm{J^2 \\cdot s^2}} \\approx 2.2734 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $n_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} \\left( 2.2734 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}} \\right)^{3/2} \\approx \\frac{1}{29.6088} \\left( 1.0841 \\times 10^{26}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 3.6614 \\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}\n$$\nTo express this result in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, we use the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, which implies $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = (100\\,\\mathrm{cm})^{-3} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{th}} = (3.6614 \\times 10^{24}) \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 3.6614 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the threshold density is $3.66 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.",

Using the derived total conductivity $\\sigma$ from $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma\\mathbf{E}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{|\\mathbf{v}_d|}{|\\mathbf{E}|} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{J}/(q n_{\\text{tot}})|}{|\\mathbf{E}|} = \\frac{|\\sigma \\mathbf{E}| / (q n_{\\text{tot}})}{|\\mathbf{E}|} = \\frac{\\sigma}{q n_{\\text{tot}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{q n_{\\text{tot}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{n_i q^2 \\tau_i}{m_i^*} = \\frac{1}{n_{\\text{tot}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i \\left(\\frac{q\\tau_i}{m_i^*}\\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that the mobility of an individual valley is $\\mu_i = \\frac{q\\tau_i}{m_i^*}$, the total mobility is the carrier-density-weighted average of the individual valley mobilities:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i \\mu_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} n_i}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nFirst, we calculate the total electron density $n_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$\nn_{\\text{tot}} = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = (3.0 \\times 10^{23}) + (1.5 \\times 10^{23}) + (0.50 \\times 10^{23}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the conductivity contribution from each valley, $\\sigma_i = \\frac{n_i q^2 \\tau_i}{m_i^*}$, using the provided SI values.\n\nFor valley 1:\n$$\nm_1^* = 0.067 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}) \\approx 6.103287 \\times 10^{-32} \\, \\text{kg}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_1 = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{23})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2(2.0 \\times 10^{-13})}{6.103287 \\times 10^{-32}} \\approx 25235.3 \\, \\text{S/m}\n$$\nFor valley 2:\n$$\nm_2^* = 0.50 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}) = 4.55469185 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_2 = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{23})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2(5.0 \\times 10^{-14})}{4.55469185 \\times 10^{-31}} \\approx 422.69 \\, \\text{S/m}\n$$\nFor valley 3:\n$$\nm_3^* = 1.00 \\times (9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}) = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_3 = \\frac{(0.50 \\times 10^{23})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2(3.0 \\times 10^{-14})}{9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}} \\approx 42.27 \\, \\text{S/m}\n$$\nThe total conductivity $\\sigma$ is the sum:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3 \\approx 25235.3 + 422.69 + 42.27 = 25700.26 \\, \\text{S/m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\sigma = 2.570 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{S/m}$.\n\nNow we calculate the total drift mobility $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\sigma}{q n_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{25700.26}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})(5.0 \\times 10^{23})} \\approx \\frac{25700.26}{80108.83} \\approx 0.320811 \\, \\text{m}^2/(\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s})\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\mu = 0.3208 \\, \\text{m}^2/(\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{s})$.\n\n### Comparison with Single-Valley Model\n\nThe multi-valley result differs from a single-valley model both in its mathematical structure and its physical outcome.\n\n**Structure:** In the multi-valley model, the total conductivity is the simple sum of the conductivities of the parallel valley channels, $\\sigma = \\sum_i \\sigma_i$. This reflects the principle of parallel conductors in an electrical circuit. The total mobility is a weighted average of individual valley mobilities, with the weighting factor being the electron population of each valley, $\\mu = (\\sum_i n_i \\mu_i) / (\\sum_i n_i)$. In contrast, a single-valley model for the total population $n_{\\text{tot}}$ would be described by a single effective mass $m_{\\text{eff}}^*$ and a single relaxation time $\\tau_{\\text{eff}}$, yielding $\\sigma_{\\text{single}} = (n_{\\text{tot}} q^2 \\tau_{\\text{eff}}) / m_{\\text{eff}}^*$. This structure obscures the underlying parallel conduction mechanism and requires the ad-hoc definition of \"effective\" average parameters, which are not simple arithmetic means of the valley parameters.\n\n**Outcome:** The numerical result highlights the importance of the multi-valley structure. Valley 1, with its very low effective mass ($m_1^* = 0.067\\,m_0$) and high relaxation time ($\\tau_1 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\text{s}$), has an extremely high mobility. Consequently, its conductivity contribution ($\\sigma_1 \\approx 25235\\,\\text{S/m}$) completely dominates the total conductivity, accounting for over $98\\%$ of the total, despite having only $60\\%$ of the total electrons ($n_1/n_{\\text{tot}} = 3/5$). The other two valleys, with heavier effective masses and shorter relaxation times, are far less conductive. If one were to incorrectly model this system with, for instance, a simple average effective mass and relaxation time, the result would drastically underestimate the total conductivity, as it would fail to capture the disproportionate contribution from the single high-mobility channel. The multi-valley model correctly shows that overall transport properties can be governed by a small but highly mobile subset of the total carrier population.",
