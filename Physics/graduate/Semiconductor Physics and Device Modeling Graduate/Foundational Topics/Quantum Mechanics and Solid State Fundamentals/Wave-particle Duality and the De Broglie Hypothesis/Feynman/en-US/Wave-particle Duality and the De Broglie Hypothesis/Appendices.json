I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe canonical partition function for a single particle in a three-dimensional volume $V$ is given by integrating the Boltzmann factor over all phase space coordinates, normalized by Planck's constant to the power of the number of degrees of freedom ($3$ in this case).\n$$\nZ_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\iint d^3\\mathbf{r} \\, d^3\\mathbf{p} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E(\\mathbf{p})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe integration over the spatial coordinates $d^3\\mathbf{r}$ over the volume $V$ simply yields a factor of $V$. The energy is given by the parabolic dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{p}) = \\mathbf{p}^2/(2m^*) = (p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2)/(2m^*)$. The partition function becomes:\n$$\nZ_1 = \\frac{V}{h^3} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{p_x^2}{2m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{p_y^2}{2m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{p_z^2}{2m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} dp_z\n$$\nEach of the three momentum integrals is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. In our case, the constant $a$ is $a = 1/(2m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$. Thus, each integral evaluates to $\\sqrt{2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}$.\nThe product of the three identical integrals is $(\\sqrt{2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T})^3 = (2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)^{3/2}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Z_1$:\n$$\nZ_1 = \\frac{V}{h^3} (2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)^{3/2}\n$$\nThe thermal de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda_T$, is defined as the length scale that makes the single-particle translational partition function dimensionless when expressed as $Z_1 = V/\\lambda_T^3$. By comparing the two expressions for $Z_1$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{\\lambda_T^3} = \\frac{V}{h^3} (2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_T^3} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}{h}\\right)^3\n$$\nTaking the cube root of both sides and inverting gives the desired expression for the thermal de Broglie wavelength:\n$$\n\\lambda_T = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the task.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for electrons and holes in GaAs at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the thermal energy term $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$:\n$k_{\\mathrm{B}}T = (1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 4.141947\\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nFor electrons, $m_e^* = 0.067\\,m_0$:\n$m_e^* = 0.067 \\times (9.10938356\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 6.103287\\times 10^{-32}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe term in the square root is:\n$2\\pi m_e^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T = 2\\pi (6.103287\\times 10^{-32}\\,\\mathrm{kg})(4.141947\\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}) = 1.58838\\times 10^{-51}\\,\\mathrm{kg^2\\,m^2/s^2}$.\nThe square root is:\n$\\sqrt{2\\pi m_e^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\sqrt{1.58838\\times 10^{-51}} = 3.98545\\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m/s}$.\nFinally, the thermal de Broglie wavelength for electrons is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{T,e} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m_e^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} = \\frac{6.62607015\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}}{3.98545\\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m/s}} = 1.6625\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 16.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\nFor holes, $m_h^* = 0.5\\,m_0$:\n$m_h^* = 0.5 \\times (9.10938356\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 4.554692\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe term in the square root is:\n$2\\pi m_h^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T = 2\\pi (4.554692\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})(4.141947\\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}) = 1.18536\\times 10^{-50}\\,\\mathrm{kg^2\\,m^2/s^2}$.\nThe square root is:\n$\\sqrt{2\\pi m_h^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\sqrt{1.18536\\times 10^{-50}} = 1.08874\\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m/s}$.\nFinally, the thermal de Broglie wavelength for holes is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{T,h} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m_h^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} = \\frac{6.62607015\\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}}{1.08874\\times 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m/s}} = 6.086\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\nThe wave-like behavior of a particle is more pronounced for a larger de Broglie wavelength. From the formula $\\lambda_T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{m^*}$, the particle with the smaller effective mass will have the larger thermal de Broglie wavelength.\nSince $m_e^* = 0.067\\,m_0 < m_h^* = 0.5\\,m_0$, it follows that $\\lambda_{T,e} > \\lambda_{T,h}$. Our calculation confirms this: $16.6\\,\\mathrm{nm} > 6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nTherefore, electrons exhibit more pronounced wave-like behavior than holes under these conditions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\lambda_{T,e} \\approx 16.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\lambda_{T,h} \\approx 6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; electrons exhibit more pronounced wave-like behavior.**\n- The calculated numerical values for $\\lambda_{T,e}$ ($16.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) and $\\lambda_{T,h}$ ($6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) match this option.\n- The inference that electrons exhibit more pronounced wave-like behavior is also correct, as $\\lambda_{T,e} > \\lambda_{T,h}$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\lambda_{T,e} \\approx 6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\lambda_{T,h} \\approx 16.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; holes exhibit more pronounced wave-like behavior.**\n- The calculated numerical values for electrons and holes are swapped. This is incorrect.\n- The inference is based on the incorrect premise that $\\lambda_{T,h} > \\lambda_{T,e}$. Since the premise is false, the conclusion is also incorrect in this context.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\lambda_{T,e} \\approx \\lambda_{T,h} \\approx 4.3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; both carriers are equally wave-like because temperature alone sets $\\lambda_T$.**\n- The statement that $\\lambda_T$ is set by temperature alone is false, as shown by the derived formula $\\lambda_T = h / \\sqrt{2\\pi m^*k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}$, which explicitly depends on the effective mass $m^*$.\n- Consequently, the claim that both carriers are equally wave-like ($\\lambda_{T,e} \\approx \\lambda_{T,h}$) is incorrect because their effective masses are different.\n- The numerical value of $4.3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ corresponds to the thermal de Broglie wavelength of a free electron with mass $m_0$, not the effective mass carriers in GaAs. Calculations show $\\lambda_T(m_0) = \\lambda_{T,h} \\sqrt{m_h^*/m_0} = 6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\times \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 4.3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This confirms the error in using $m_0$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\lambda_{T,e} \\approx 29.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\lambda_{T,h} \\approx 10.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; electrons exhibit more pronounced wave-like behavior.**\n- While the inference that electrons are more wave-like is correct, the numerical values are not.\n- The ratio of the given values is $\\lambda_{T,e}/\\lambda_{T,h} \\approx 29.4/10.8 \\approx 2.72$. This ratio correctly matches the theoretical ratio $\\sqrt{m_h^*/m_e^*} = \\sqrt{0.5/0.067} \\approx 2.73$.\n- However, the absolute magnitudes are incorrect. They seem to be calculated using a temperature of approximately $T \\approx 100\\,\\mathrm{K}$ instead of the specified $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. For example, $\\lambda_T \\propto 1/\\sqrt{T}$, so a change from $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $100\\,\\mathrm{K}$ would increase $\\lambda_T$ by a factor of $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$. Our calculated values become $16.6\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 28.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $6.1\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 10.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which closely match the values in this option. Since the problem specifies $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, these values are incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It describes a canonical magnetic focusing experiment in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), a standard topic in semiconductor physics. We can proceed to derive the requested expression.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Lorentz force law for an electron of charge $-e$ and effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ oriented perpendicular to the plane of the 2DEG. The force is given by $\\vec{F} = -e(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$. Since $\\vec{v}$ is in the plane of the 2DEG and $\\vec{B}$ is perpendicular to it, the force vector $\\vec{F}$ lies within the plane and is always orthogonal to the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$. This constant perpendicular force acts as a centripetal force, causing the electron to follow a circular trajectory. The magnitude of this force is $F = evB$, where $v = |\\vec{v}|$ and $B = |\\vec{B}|$.\n\nFor uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the centripetal force required is $F_c = \\frac{m^{\\ast}v^2}{R_c}$, where $R_c$ is the radius of the circle, known as the cyclotron radius. Transport is dominated by electrons at the Fermi energy, so their speed is the Fermi speed, $v_F$. Equating the magnetic force to the centripetal force for these electrons yields:\n$$ e v_F B = \\frac{m^{\\ast} v_F^2}{R_c} $$\nSolving this equation for the cyclotron radius $R_c$ gives:\n$$ R_c = \\frac{m^{\\ast} v_F}{eB} $$\nThe problem requires starting from the de Broglie hypothesis, which relates the crystal momentum of a particle, $\\vec{p}$, to its wave vector, $\\vec{k}$, through the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$: $\\vec{p} = \\hbar \\vec{k}$. For the assumed isotropic, parabolic conduction band, the crystal momentum is equivalent to the kinetic momentum, so $p = m^{\\ast}v$. For electrons at the Fermi surface, the magnitude of the momentum is the Fermi momentum, $p_F = m^{\\ast}v_F$, and the magnitude of the wave vector is the Fermi wave vector, $k_F$. Therefore, we establish the connection:\n$$ m^{\\ast} v_F = \\hbar k_F $$\nBy substituting this into the expression for the cyclotron radius, we can express $R_c$ in terms of the Fermi wave vector $k_F$ instead of the Fermi velocity:\n$$ R_c = \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{eB} $$\nThis step effectively incorporates the wave-particle duality of the electron into the description of its classical trajectory.\n\nMagnetic focusing peaks are observed when electrons launched from the injector are focused onto the collector. The geometry consists of two points separated by a distance $L$ along a straight, specularly reflecting boundary. A focusing event occurs when the trajectory of an electron bridges this distance. The problem states that the integer index $n \\geq 1$ corresponds to the number of half-orbits (or boundary-to-boundary chord spans) connecting the injector and collector. Each half-orbit is a semi-circle with a diameter of $2R_c$. An electron trajectory consisting of $n$ such consecutive semi-circles, joined by $n-1$ specular reflections at the boundary, will cover a total distance along the boundary equal to $n$ times the diameter of the cyclotron orbit. Therefore, the condition for the $n$-th focusing peak is:\n$$ L = n (2R_c) $$\nLetting $B_n$ be the magnetic field value corresponding to the $n$-th peak, we can substitute our expression for $R_c$:\n$$ L = n \\left( 2 \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{e B_n} \\right) $$\nWe can now solve for $B_n$:\n$$ B_n = \\frac{2n\\hbar k_F}{eL} $$\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of the 2D sheet density $n_s$. We must relate $k_F$ to $n_s$. In a 2DEG, the available electronic states in k-space form a uniform grid. At low temperatures, states are filled up to the Fermi energy, forming a circle in k-space with radius $k_F$ (the Fermi circle). The area occupied by a single electronic state in k-space, considering the real-space area $A$, is $(2\\pi)^2/A$. The total number of states $N$ within the Fermi circle of area $\\pi k_F^2$, accounting for the twofold spin degeneracy ($g_s=2$), is:\n$$ N = g_s \\frac{\\text{Area in k-space}}{\\text{Area per state}} = 2 \\frac{\\pi k_F^2}{(2\\pi)^2 / A} = \\frac{2A\\pi k_F^2}{4\\pi^2} = \\frac{A k_F^2}{2\\pi} $$\nThe sheet density $n_s$ is the number of electrons per unit area, $n_s = N/A$.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps:\n1.  Determine the quantized energy levels for transverse motion within the QPC constriction.\n2.  Calculate the number of conducting modes at the Fermi energy.\n3.  Apply the Landauer formula to find the conductance.\n\n**1. Transverse Mode Quantization**\n\nThe QPC acts as an electronic waveguide of width $W$. The problem specifies hard-wall boundary conditions, which means the electron wavefunction must be zero at the edges of the constriction. This is analogous to the \"particle in a one-dimensional box\" problem for the transverse motion (let's say, along the $y$-direction).\n\nA standing wave is formed in the transverse direction, requiring the width $W$ to be an integer multiple of half the transverse de Broglie wavelength, $\\lambda_{y,n}$:\n$$W = n \\frac{\\lambda_{y,n}}{2}, \\quad n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$$\nHere, $n$ is the transverse mode index, a positive integer.\n\nAccording to the de Broglie hypothesis, the momentum is related to wavelength by $p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$. Thus, the transverse momentum $p_y$ is quantized:\n$$p_{y,n} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda_{y,n}} = \\frac{nh}{2W}$$\nThe kinetic energy associated with this transverse motion forms a set of discrete energy subbands, $E_n$:\n$$E_n = \\frac{p_{y,n}^2}{2m^*} = \\frac{1}{2m^*} \\left(\\frac{nh}{2W}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8m^* W^2}$$\nwhere $m^*$ is the effective mass of an electron in the 2DEG.\n\n**2. Number of Conducting Modes**\n\nTransport occurs for electrons at the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The total energy of an electron is the sum of its longitudinal (propagating) and transverse (quantized) kinetic energies:\n$$E_F = E_{\\text{longitudinal}} + E_n$$\nFor an electron to propagate through the constriction (i.e., for the mode to be \"open\" or \"conducting\"), its longitudinal kinetic energy must be non-negative: $E_{\\text{longitudinal}} \\ge 0$. This imposes the condition that the transverse energy cannot exceed the Fermi energy:\n$$E_n \\le E_F$$\nThe problem states that the Fermi wavelength $\\lambda_F$ in the reservoirs is constant. The Fermi energy is related to $\\lambda_F$ by:\n$$E_F = \\frac{p_F^2}{2m^*} = \\frac{(h/\\lambda_F)^2}{2m^*} = \\frac{h^2}{2m^*\\lambda_F^2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_n$ and $E_F$ into the inequality $E_n \\le E_F$ gives:\n$$\\frac{n^2 h^2}{8m^* W^2} \\le \\frac{h^2}{2m^*\\lambda_F^2}$$\nWe can simplify this by canceling common terms ($h^2$, $m^*$, $2$):\n$$\\frac{n^2}{4W^2} \\le \\frac{1}{\\lambda_F^2}$$\n$$n^2 \\le \\frac{4W^2}{\\lambda_F^2}$$\nSince $n$ must be positive, we can take the square root of both sides:\n$$n \\le \\frac{2W}{\\lambda_F}$$\nThe total number of open transverse modes, denoted by $N$, is the largest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. This is precisely the definition of the floor function:\n$$N = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2W}{\\lambda_F} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\n**3. Conductance from the Landauer Formula**\n\nThe Landauer formula gives the zero-temperature linear-response conductance $G$ as a sum over all available conducting channels:\n$$G = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\sum_{\\text{channels}} T_{\\text{channel}}$$\nwhere $T_{\\text{channel}}$ is the transmission probability of a given channel. The problem specifies:\n- The transport is ballistic and adiabatic, so each open mode transmits with unit probability ($T=1$).\n- There is a twofold spin degeneracy for each transverse mode.\n- There is no valley degeneracy.\n\nFor each of the $N$ open transverse modes, there are two spin channels (spin-up and spin-down). Therefore, the total number of conducting channels is $2N$. Since each channel has a transmission probability of $1$, the summation becomes:\n$$G = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\sum_{i=1}^{2N} (1) = \\frac{2Ne^2}{h}$$\nThe term $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$ is the quantized conductance, including spin.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $N$ and the gate-voltage-dependent width, $W(V_g)$, to obtain the final expression for $G(V_g)$. The width is given as:\n$$W(V_g) = W_0 - \\alpha V_g$$\nThe number of open modes as a function of the gate voltage $V_g$ is:\n$$N(V_g) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2(W_0 - \\alpha V_g)}{\\lambda_F} \\right\\rfloor$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for conductance yields the final result:\n$$G(V_g) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} N(V_g) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2(W_0 - \\alpha V_g)}{\\lambda_F} \\right\\rfloor$$\nThis expression gives the conductance in plateaus quantized in units of $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$, which is the characteristic experimental signature of a QPC. The expression is in terms of the required parameters $W_0$, $\\alpha$, $\\lambda_F$, $e$, and $h$. The units of $e^2/h$ are Siemens, so the expression is dimensionally correct for conductance. The floor function, $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$, is a well-defined mathematical function, making this a closed-form analytic expression.",
