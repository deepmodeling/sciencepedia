It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics, specifically the band structure of silicon and phonon-assisted electronic transitions. The provided data are standard and accurate, and the problem is well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. All necessary information is present, and the question is formulated with sufficient clarity and objectivity. Therefore, I will proceed with a detailed solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the properties of a phonon involved in an indirect interband transition in silicon.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this process is the conservation of crystal momentum. For an electronic transition from an initial state with wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}_i$ to a final state with wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}_f$, mediated by a photon of wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ and a phonon of wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$, the conservation law is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{k}_f = \\boldsymbol{k}_i + \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\mathrm{ph}} \\pm \\boldsymbol{q} + \\boldsymbol{G} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{G}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector. The sign of $\\boldsymbol{q}$ depends on whether a phonon is absorbed ($+$) or emitted ($-$).\n\nThe problem provides several simplifying conditions:\n1.  The initial state is the valence-band maximum (VBM), which is at the center of the Brillouin zone (BZ), the $\\Gamma$ point. Thus, the initial electron wavevector is $\\boldsymbol{k}_i = \\boldsymbol{k}_v = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n2.  The final state is one of the six equivalent conduction-band minima (CBM), located in the $\\Delta$ valleys. We denote the wavevector of such a minimum as $\\boldsymbol{k}_c$.\n3.  The photon wavevector is considered negligible, $\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\mathrm{ph}} \\approx \\boldsymbol{0}$. This is a standard and highly accurate approximation, as the momentum of a photon with energy on the order of the bandgap is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crystal momentum corresponding to the BZ dimensions.\n4.  The process is a \"normal\" (non-umklapp) process, which implies that no reciprocal lattice vector is involved, so $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the conservation equation yields:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{k}_c = \\boldsymbol{0} + \\boldsymbol{0} \\pm \\boldsymbol{q} + \\boldsymbol{0} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{k}_c = \\pm \\boldsymbol{q} $$\nThis result shows that the required phonon wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$ must be equal in magnitude and direction (or anti-direction) to the wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}_c$ of the final electron state in the conduction band minimum, measured from the BZ center.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the minimal-magnitude phonon wavevector, $q = |\\boldsymbol{q}|$. From our conservation analysis, this is simply the magnitude of the CBM wavevector, $q = |\\boldsymbol{k}_c|$.\n\nThe problem states that the CBMs are located along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions at a wavevector magnitude of $k_0 = \\eta \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}}$, where $\\eta = 0.85$ and the lattice constant of silicon is $a_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 5.431~\\text{\\AA}$. Therefore, the required phonon wavevector magnitude is:\n$$ q = k_0 = \\eta \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}} $$\n\nWe now compute the numerical value. We must use SI units, so we convert the lattice constant from angstroms to meters:\n$a_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 5.431~\\text{\\AA} = 5.431 \\times 10^{-10}~\\text{m}$.\n$$ q = (0.85) \\frac{2\\pi}{5.431 \\times 10^{-10}~\\text{m}} $$\n$$ q \\approx \\frac{5.3407075}{5.431 \\times 10^{-10}}~\\text{m}^{-1} \\approx 9.83375 \\times 10^9~\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nRounding this value to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$ q \\approx 9.83 \\times 10^9~\\text{m}^{-1} $$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to identify the phonon branches that can provide a phonon with this wavevector. The wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$ must connect the $\\Gamma$ point ($\\boldsymbol{k}=\\boldsymbol{0}$) to a CBM at $\\boldsymbol{k}_c$. Since the CBMs lie along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ directions in reciprocal space, the phonon wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$ must also be directed along one of these axes, e.g., $\\boldsymbol{q} = q \\hat{k}_x$. In the standard representation of the face-centered cubic (FCC) Brillouin zone, which applies to the diamond-cubic structure of silicon, the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ axes correspond to the high-symmetry lines denoted as $\\Gamma$-$X$.\n\nThe zone boundary along this direction is the $X$ point, which is located at a wavevector magnitude of $k_X = \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}}$. The magnitude of our required phonon wavevector is $q = 0.85 \\frac{2\\pi}{a_{\\mathrm{Si}}} = 0.85 \\, k_X$. Since $q  k_X$, the phonon wavevector lies within the first Brillouin zone, along the $\\Gamma-X$ line.\n\nAlong any high-symmetry line such as $\\Gamma-X$, the phonon dispersion relation for silicon has multiple branches. For a diatomic basis in the diamond-cubic structure (which has $2$ atoms per primitive cell), there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ phonon branches. Three are acoustic (TA, LA) and three are optical (TO, LO). Along the $\\Gamma-X$ direction ([100]), the two transverse branches (TA and TO) are degenerate. This results in four distinct dispersion curves:\n1.  Transverse Acoustic (TA)\n2.  Longitudinal Acoustic (LA)\n3.  Transverse Optical (TO), doubly degenerate\n4.  Longitudinal Optical (LO)\n\nThe question asks which of these branches possess modes at the required wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$, based on momentum conservation alone. Since the wavevector $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is on the $\\Gamma-X$ line and is strictly between $\\Gamma$ and $X$, phonon modes exist on all four of these branches at this specific wavevector. The problem explicitly states to ignore matrix-element selection rules, which might forbid transitions involving certain phonon symmetries. Therefore, based on the sole criterion of momentum conservation, any of these four branches can supply the necessary phonon.\n\nUsing the provided integer coding:\n-   Transverse Acoustic (TA) $\\rightarrow 1$\n-   Longitudinal Acoustic (LA) $\\rightarrow 2$\n-   Transverse Optical (TO) $\\rightarrow 3$\n-   Longitudinal Optical (LO) $\\rightarrow 4$\n\nAll four branch classes are possible. The corresponding codes are $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the numerical value of $q$ and the integer codes for the possible phonon branches.",

We shall proceed with a first-principles derivation.\n\nThe conductivity effective mass is derived by considering the response of charge carriers to an applied electric field within the Drude model framework, extended to account for the multivalley and anisotropic nature of the conduction band in silicon.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between an applied electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and the resulting steady-state drift velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_i$ for an electron in a single valley $i$. The equation of motion for an electron, including the scattering term from the Drude model, is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{M}_i \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\boldsymbol{M}_i \\boldsymbol{v}(t)}{\\tau} = -e\\boldsymbol{E} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{M}_i$ is the effective mass tensor for valley $i$, $\\tau$ is the momentum relaxation time (assumed to be valley-independent), and $-e$ is the charge of an electron.

Substituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{v}_i$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{J}_i = n_i (-e) (-e\\tau \\boldsymbol{M}_i^{-1} \\boldsymbol{E}) = n_i e^2 \\tau \\boldsymbol{M}_i^{-1} \\boldsymbol{E} $$\nThis defines the conductivity tensor for valley $i$ as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_i = n_i e^2 \\tau \\boldsymbol{M}_i^{-1}$.\n\nSilicon has $N=6$ equivalent conduction band minima (valleys) located along the $\\pm[100]$, $\\pm[010]$, and $\\pm[001]$ directions. The problem states that these valleys have equal occupancy. If the total electron concentration is $n$, then the concentration in each valley is $n_i = n/N = n/6$.\n\nThe total current density $\\boldsymbol{J}$ is the sum of the contributions from all six valleys:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{J} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\boldsymbol{J}_i = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_i \\right) \\boldsymbol{E} = \\left( \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\boldsymbol{M}_i^{-1} \\right) \\boldsymbol{E} $$\nThe total conductivity tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{total} = \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\boldsymbol{M}_i^{-1}$.\n\nThe inverse effective mass tensor $\\boldsymbol{M}^{-1}$ is diagonal in a coordinate system aligned with the principal axes of the constant-energy ellipsoid. For a valley oriented along the $k_z$ axis, the longitudinal mass is $m_l$ and the two transverse masses are $m_t$.

This is a classic problem in semiconductor physics, addressing hot-electron effects and intervalley scattering, which are the physical origins of the Gunn effect and negative differential resistance (NDR). The provided model is a self-consistent energy-balance formulation, which we will implement as specified.\n\nThe core of the model lies in the interplay between the electron temperature, $T_e$, and the ensemble drift velocity, $v_d$. As the electric field $E$ increases, electrons gain energy. At steady state, this energy gain is balanced by energy loss to the crystal lattice, primarily through phonon scattering. This balance elevates the electron temperature $T_e$ above the lattice temperature $T_l$. A higher $T_e$ alters electron mobility and, crucially, enables electrons to transfer from the central, high-mobility $\\Gamma$ valley to higher-energy, low-mobility satellite valleys ($L$ and $X$). This redistribution of a non-degenerate electron population, governed by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, reduces the overall average velocity of the ensemble.\n\nThe problem specifies a set of coupled equations that model this behavior. A self-consistent solution for the pair $(v_d, T_e)$ must be found for each given electric field $E$. The prescribed method is a fixed-point iteration scheme.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters and governing equations in the International System of Units (SI). All energy values must be converted from electron-volts (eV) to Joules (J) by multiplying by the elementary charge $q$.\n\nThe physical constants are:\n- Elementary charge $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- Boltzmann's constant $k_B = 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$.\n- Electron rest mass $m_0 = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nThe material parameters for GaAs are used to define valley-specific properties for the $\\Gamma$, $L$, and $X$ valleys (indexed by $i$):\n- Effective masses $m_i^*$: $m_{\\Gamma}^* = 0.067 m_0$, $m_{L}^* = 0.22 m_0$, $m_{X}^* = 0.85 m_0$.\n- Valley degeneracies $g_i$: $g_{\\Gamma} = 1$, $g_{L} = 4$, $g_{X} = 3$.\n- Energy separations from the $\\Gamma$ minimum: $\\Delta_L = 0.29\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, $\\Delta_X = 0.48\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- Low-field mobilities $\\mu_{i,0}$: $\\mu_{\\Gamma,0} = 0.85\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V\\cdot s)}$, $\\mu_{L,0} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V\\cdot s)}$, $\\mu_{X,0} = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V\\cdot s)}$.\n- Momentum relaxation exponents $\\alpha_i$: $\\alpha_{\\Gamma} = 1.5$, $\\alpha_{L} = 1.0$, $\\alpha_{X} = 1.0$.\n\nFrom the low-field mobilities, we determine the momentum relaxation time at the lattice temperature, $\\tau_{m0,i}$, for each valley $i$ using the relation from the relaxation time approximation:\n$$\n\\tau_{m0,i} = \\frac{\\mu_{i,0} m_i^*}{q}\n$$\n\nThe model's key equations are:\n1.  **Single-Valley Transport:** The drift velocity $v_i$ and mobility $\\mu_i$ in each valley depend on the electron temperature $T_e$:\n    $$\n    v_i(E, T_e) = \\mu_i(T_e) E\n    $$\n    where the mobility is given by $\\mu_i(T_e) = \\frac{q \\tau_{m,i}(T_e)}{m_i^*}$, and the momentum relaxation time $\\tau_{m,i}$ follows a power-law dependence on $T_e$:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{m,i}(T_e) = \\tau_{m0,i} \\left( \\frac{T_l}{T_e} \\right)^{\\alpha_i}\n    $$\n    This captures the effect of increased scattering at higher electron temperatures.\n\n2.  **Valley Populations:** The fraction of electrons $f_i$ in each valley is determined by a quasi-thermal equilibrium at temperature $T_e$. The population weights $W_i$ are proportional to the density of states, which scales as $g_i (m_i^*)^{3/2}$, and a Boltzmann factor for the satellite valleys:\n    $$\n    W_{\\Gamma}(T_e) = g_{\\Gamma} (m_{\\Gamma}^*)^{3/2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    W_j(E, T_e) = g_j (m_j^*)^{3/2} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\Delta_j^{\\mathrm{eff}}(E, T_e)}{k_B T_e} \\right), \\quad j \\in \\{L, X\\}\n    $$\n    The model includes a field-assisted barrier lowering mechanism, which reduces the effective energy separation $\\Delta_j$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_j^{\\mathrm{eff}}(E,T_e) = \\max\\left\\{ \\Delta_j - \\beta q E \\ell_{\\Gamma}(E,T_e),\\, 0 \\right\\}\n    $$\n    Here, $\\beta$ is a given factor, and $\\ell_{\\Gamma}(E,T_e) = v_{\\Gamma}(E,T_e) \\tau_{m,\\Gamma}(T_e)$ is the mean free path in the $\\Gamma$ valley. The population fractions are then found by normalization:\n    $$\n    f_i = \\frac{W_i}{W_{\\Gamma} + W_{L} + W_{X}}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Ensemble Drift Velocity:** The total drift velocity $v_d$ is the average of the single-valley velocities, weighted by their respective population fractions:\n    $$\n    v_d(E, T_e) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\Gamma,L,X\\}} f_i(E, T_e) v_i(E, T_e)\n    $$\n\n4.  **Energy Balance:** The electron temperature $T_e$ is determined by the steady-state energy balance equation, which equates the power gained per electron from the field, $qEv_d$, to the power lost to the lattice. The latter is modeled as $\\frac{3}{2} k_B (T_e - T_l) / \\tau_E$, where $\\tau_E$ is the energy relaxation time. Rearranging for $T_e$ gives the update rule for the iteration:\n    $$\n    T_e = T_l + \\frac{2 q E v_d \\tau_E}{3 k_B}\n    $$\n\nThese equations are coupled and must be solved self-consistently. The algorithm proceeds as follows for each electric field $E$ and set of parameters $(T_l, \\tau_E, \\beta)$:\n1.  Initialize the electron temperature: $T_e \\leftarrow T_l$. For the special case $E=0$, the velocity is $v_d=0$ and $T_e=T_l$ trivially.\n2.  Begin a fixed-point iteration loop that continues until the change in $T_e$ between successive iterations is below a tolerance of $10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n3.  Inside the loop:\n    a. Using the current value of $T_e$, calculate $\\tau_{m,i}$, $\\mu_i$, and $v_i$ for each valley.\n    b. Calculate the $\\Gamma$-valley mean free path $\\ell_{\\Gamma}$ and then the effective barriers $\\Delta_{L,X}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n    c. Calculate the population weights $W_i$ and the normalized fractions $f_i$.\n    d. Compute the ensemble drift velocity $v_d$ as the weighted average of the valley velocities.\n    e. Compute an updated electron temperature $T_e^{\\text{new}}$ using the energy balance equation with the just-calculated $v_d$.\n    f. Set $T_e \\leftarrow T_e^{\\text{new}}$ for the next iteration.\n4.  Once the loop terminates, the final computed value of $v_d$ is taken as the solution, which is then rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nThis procedure is implemented in a Python script. The script pre-calculates constant factors like $\\tau_{m0,i}$ and the density-of-states prefactors $g_i (m_i^*)^{3/2}$ for efficiency. A function encapsulates the iterative solver, which is then called for each specified electric field in each of the $4$ test cases. The final results are collected and formatted into the specified list-of-lists structure.",
