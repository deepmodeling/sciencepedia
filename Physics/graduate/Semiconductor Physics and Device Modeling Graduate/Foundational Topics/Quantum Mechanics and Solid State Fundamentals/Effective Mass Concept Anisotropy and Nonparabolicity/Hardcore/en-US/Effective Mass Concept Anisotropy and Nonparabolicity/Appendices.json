            "introduction": "The parabolic band approximation, where effective mass is constant, provides a simplified picture of carrier dynamics. In reality, as carriers gain energy and move away from the band edge, the band structure deviates from a simple parabola, a phenomenon known as nonparabolicity. This practice demonstrates how to quantify the impact of this energy-dependent mass on a key macroscopic parameter: the effective density of states. By working through the derivation for the widely used Kane model, you will learn how to define a temperature-dependent density-of-states mass, $m_d(T)$, which is crucial for accurately calculating carrier concentrations at finite temperatures .",
