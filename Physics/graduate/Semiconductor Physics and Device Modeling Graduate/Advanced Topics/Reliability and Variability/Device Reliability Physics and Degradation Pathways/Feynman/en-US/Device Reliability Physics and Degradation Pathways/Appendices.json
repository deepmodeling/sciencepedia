            "problem": "A damascene copper interconnect in a back-end-of-line metallization stack fails by electromigration, which is driven by a thermally activated atomic transport process under electron wind force. The failure rate increases with increasing current density due to enhanced momentum transfer, and increases with temperature due to higher atomic mobility. For two otherwise identical straight interconnect segments (same line width, length, microstructure, interfaces, and barrier conditions), let the current densities be $J_1$ and $J_2$, the effective current exponent be $n$, and the activation energy for the rate-limiting process be $E_a$. Assume both segments are stressed isothermally at temperature $T$, and that the damage rate is proportional to a power law in current density and has Arrhenius temperature dependence.\n\nUsing these fundamentals, derive the scaling of the mean time to failure (MTTF) with $J$ and $T$ and obtain a closed-form expression for the lifetime ratio $R \\equiv \\mathrm{MTTF}_1/\\mathrm{MTTF}_2$ between the two segments in terms of $J_1$, $J_2$, $n$, $E_a$, $T$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is based on the well-established physical model for electromigration failure in semiconductor interconnects, known as Black's equation. The provided parameters are physically realistic, and the problem is self-contained and well-posed.\n\nThe problem states that the damage rate is proportional to a power law in current density ($J$) and has an Arrhenius temperature dependence. The mean time to failure (MTTF) is inversely proportional to this damage rate. This relationship is the basis for Black's equation.\n\nFirst, we establish the functional form for the MTTF. The damage rate, $\\mathcal{R}_D$, can be written as:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_D \\propto J^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $J$ is the current density, $n$ is the current exponent, $E_a$ is the activation energy for the diffusion process, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe mean time to failure is inversely proportional to the damage rate, as a specific amount of accumulated damage leads to failure.\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_D} $$\nCombining these proportionalities, we derive the scaling of MTTF with $J$ and $T$, which is Black's equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF} = A J^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nHere, $A$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the material properties, geometry, and microstructure of the interconnect line.\n\nThe problem describes two interconnect segments, labeled $1$ and $2$, which are \"otherwise identical\" and stressed isothermally at the same temperature $T$. This means the pre-factor $A$, the activation energy $E_a$, the current exponent $n$, and the temperature $T$ are the same for both segments. The only difference is the current density, which is $J_1$ for segment $1$ and $J_2$ for segment $2$.\n\nWe can write the MTTF for each segment using Black's equation:\nFor segment $1$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF}_1 = A J_1^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nFor segment $2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTTF}_2 = A J_2^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem asks for a closed-form expression for the lifetime ratio $R \\equiv \\mathrm{MTTF}_1 / \\mathrm{MTTF}_2$. We can find this by taking the ratio of the two expressions above:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathrm{MTTF}_1}{\\mathrm{MTTF}_2} = \\frac{A J_1^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)}{A J_2^{-n} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nSince the pre-factor $A$ and the temperature $T$ are identical for both segments, the term $A$ and the exponential term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$ cancel out. This is a crucial simplification that arises from the isothermal stress condition. The problem provides values for $E_a$ and $T$, but they are not needed for the calculation of the ratio $R$ under these specific conditions.\n\nThe expression for $R$ simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{J_1^{-n}}{J_2^{-n}} = \\left(\\frac{J_1}{J_2}\\right)^{-n} = \\left(\\frac{J_2}{J_1}\\right)^n $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the lifetime ratio $R$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $R$ using the given numerical values:\n$J_1 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{MA/cm}^2$\n$J_2 = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MA/cm}^2$\n$n = 1.1$\n\nThe units of current density ($\\mathrm{MA/cm}^2$) cancel in the ratio $J_2/J_1$.\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{1.2}{0.8}\\right)^{1.1} = (1.5)^{1.1} $$\nWe can compute this value:\n$$ R = 1.5620803... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 1.562 $$",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe survival function $S(t)$ is related to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(t)$ by the relation $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$.\n\nFor a single reference subarea of area $A_{0}$, the CDF is given as:\n$$F_{A_{0}}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the survival function for the subarea is:\n$$S_{A_{0}}(t) = 1 - F_{A_{0}}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that for a total area $A = N A_{0}$, the total survival function $S_{A}(t)$ follows the weakest-link model, where the survival of the whole is the product of the survival of its independent parts:\n$$S_{A}(t) = \\left[S_{A_{0}}(t)\\right]^{N}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{A_{0}}(t)$:\n$$S_{A}(t) = \\left[\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)\\right]^{N} = \\exp\\left(-N\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)$$\nSince $A = N A_{0}$, we can write $N = \\frac{A}{A_{0}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $S_{A}(t)$:\n$$S_{A}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)$$\n\nThe CDF for the total area $A$ is then:\n$$F_{A}(t) = 1 - S_{A}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)$$\nThis shows that the breakdown time for the total area $A$ also follows a Weibull distribution. We can identify its scale parameter $\\eta(A)$ by writing the CDF in the standard form $F_{A}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta(A)}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right)$. Comparing the two forms gives:\n$$\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta(A)}\\right)^{\\beta} = \\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\left(\\eta(A)\\right)^{\\beta}} = \\frac{A}{A_{0}} \\frac{1}{\\left(\\eta_{0}\\right)^{\\beta}}$$\n$$\\eta(A) = \\eta_{0} \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{A}\\right)^{1/\\beta}$$\n\nThe problem defines $t_{63}(A)$ as the time at which $F_{A}(t_{63}(A)) = 1 - \\exp(-1)$. Let us solve for this time:\n$$1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\left(\\frac{t_{63}(A)}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right) = 1 - \\exp(-1)$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\left(\\frac{t_{63}(A)}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right) = \\exp(-1)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\left(\\frac{t_{63}(A)}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta} = -1$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{t_{63}(A)}{\\eta_{0}}\\right)^{\\beta} = \\frac{A_{0}}{A}$$\nSolving for $t_{63}(A)$:\n$$\\frac{t_{63}(A)}{\\eta_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{A}\\right)^{1/\\beta}$$\n$$t_{63}(A) = \\eta_{0} \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{A}\\right)^{1/\\beta}$$\nThis completes the first task, deriving the dependence of $t_{63}(A)$ on $A$. This time corresponds to the characteristic lifetime (scale parameter) $\\eta(A)$ of the Weibull distribution for the total area $A$.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio $r = \\frac{t_{63}(2A)}{t_{63}(A)}$. Using the derived expression for $t_{63}(A)$:\n$$t_{63}(2A) = \\eta_{0} \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{2A}\\right)^{1/\\beta}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$r = \\frac{t_{63}(2A)}{t_{63}(A)} = \\frac{\\eta_{0} \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{2A}\\right)^{1/\\beta}}{\\eta_{0} \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{A}\\right)^{1/\\beta}} = \\frac{\\left(A_{0}/(2A)\\right)^{1/\\beta}}{\\left(A_{0}/A\\right)^{1/\\beta}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{2A} \\cdot \\frac{A}{A_{0}}\\right)^{1/\\beta} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1/\\beta}$$\nThe problem states that $\\beta=2$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been meticulously validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in reliability physics and statistical modeling, well-posed with a clear and complete set of instructions, and internally consistent. All necessary data, models, and procedures are specified, making it a solvable problem. Accordingly, a complete solution is provided below.\n\nThe core of the task is to perform a comparative analysis of three lifetime distribution models—Weibull, Log-Normal, and Log-Logistic—on several synthetic datasets representing semiconductor device failures. The analysis involves three main stages: data generation, model fitting via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) under right-censoring, and model selection using a hybrid criterion that combines statistical fit, via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), with a physical interpretability constraint.\n\nFirst, the necessary datasets are generated according to the specifications. For each dataset, a parent distribution is defined, and a sample of a specified size is drawn. Right-censoring is then applied, where any failure time exceeding a given censoring time is replaced by that censoring time, and its status is marked as censored. This process mimics accelerated life testing where experiments are terminated before all devices fail. For reproducibility, a specific pseudorandom number generator seed is used for each dataset. All time quantities are handled in seconds ($s$).\n\nSecond, for each dataset, we fit the three specified parametric lifetime models. The fitting process is based on maximizing the log-likelihood function for right-censored data.

The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) consists of finding the parameter values $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ that maximize this function. Computationally, this is achieved by minimizing the negative log-likelihood using numerical optimization algorithms. To ensure that the model parameters remain in their valid domains (e.g., shape and scale parameters must be positive), we reparameterize them. For a positive parameter $p$, we optimize its logarithm, $\\log p$, over the real line.\n\nThe specific negative log-likelihood functions, which are the objective functions for our numerical minimization, are as follows.

These are best computed using library functions for the normal distribution's log-PDF and log-survival function (logsf) for numerical stability.\n\n3.  **Log-Logistic Model**: Parameters are scale $\\alpha > 0$ and shape $\\beta > 0$. We optimize over $\\boldsymbol{\\phi} = [\\log \\alpha, \\log \\beta]$.\n    The log-PDF is $\\log f_{\\text{LL}}(t) = \\log\\beta + (\\beta-1)\\log t - \\beta\\log\\alpha - 2\\log(1 + (t/\\alpha)^\\beta)$.\n    The log-survival is $\\log S_{\\text{LL}}(t) = -\\log(1 + (t/\\alpha)^\\beta)$. We use `np.log1p` for the term $\\log(1+x)$ to maintain precision.\n\nThird, after obtaining the MLE parameters $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ and the corresponding maximum log-likelihood value $\\log L(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ for each model, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), an estimator of prediction error and thereby relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. It is defined as:\n$$\nAIC = 2k - 2\\log L(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of estimated parameters in the model. For all three models considered here, $k=2$.\n\nFinally, we apply the specified model selection rule. This rule integrates the statistical evidence (AIC) with a physics-based constraint. The constraint reflects the expectation that wear-out failure mechanisms, common in semiconductor devices, should exhibit a monotonically increasing hazard function. Among the three models, only the Weibull model with shape parameter $m > 1$ satisfies this condition.\n\nThe selection procedure is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the AIC for all three models. Let the minimum AIC be $AIC_{\\min}$.\n2.  Form a candidate set of models whose AIC values are close to the minimum, specifically, models for which $AIC - AIC_{\\min} \\le \\Delta$, with the specified tolerance $\\Delta=2$.\n3.  Check if this candidate set contains any physically interpretable model (i.e., a Weibull fit with $\\widehat{m} > 1$).\n4.  If it does, the selected model is the one with the lowest AIC from this subset of interpretable candidates.\n5.  If it does not, the selected model is simply the one with the overall minimum AIC.\n\nOnce the best model is selected, we determine the physical interpretability flag ($1$ if the chosen model is Weibull with $\\widehat{m}>1$, $0$ otherwise). We also compute the AIC difference between the selected model and the best-fitting non-selected model (the runner-up). The final output for each dataset is a list containing the selected model's code ($0$: Weibull, $1$: Log-Normal, $2$: Log-Logistic), the interpretability flag, and the calculated AIC difference. This entire process is repeated for each of the five specified datasets. The implementation uses `scipy.optimize.minimize` for MLE and `numpy` for numerical computations and data generation.",
