It uses standard models (Poisson's equation, depletion approximation) and realistic physical parameters. The phenomenon of punchthrough is a critical short-channel effect in MOSFETs, and its analysis using this model is a standard academic exercise. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants, material properties, device parameters, and a clear physical model to derive a unique solution for the critical channel length. The language is objective and precise. The condition $N_{D} \\gg N_{A}$ (specifically, $10^{20} \\gg 10^{17}$) is satisfied, justifying the use of the one-sided junction approximation. All data are consistent and physically realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived and computed.\n\n**Derivation of Critical Channel Length**\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(x)$ is the space-charge density and $\\varepsilon_{s} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nWe model the lateral source-body and drain-body junctions as one-sided abrupt $p$-$n$ junctions. Since the donor concentration in the n-type regions ($N_D$) is much greater than the acceptor concentration in the p-type body ($N_A$), the depletion region extends almost entirely into the p-type body. We can thus approximate the space-charge density within this depletion region of width $W$ (on the p-side) as:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = -q N_{A} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < x < W\n$$\nHere, $x=0$ is the metallurgical junction and $x=W$ is the edge of the depletion region in the p-type body.\n\nPoisson's equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nIntegrating once with respect to $x$ gives the electric field $E(x) = -d\\psi/dx$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} x + C_{1}\n$$\nThe electric field must be zero at the edge of the depletion region, $x=W$. So, $-E(W) = (d\\psi/dx)|_{x=W} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} W + C_{1} \\implies C_{1} = -\\frac{q N_{A} W}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nThus, the electric field is $E(x) = - \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} (W - x)$.\n\nIntegrating again gives the potential $\\psi(x)$:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} (W-x)^{2} + C_{2}\n$$\nLet's set the potential at the edge of the depletion region (in the neutral p-type body, which is at potential $V_B=0\\mathrm{V}$) to be the reference potential, $\\psi(W) = 0$. This gives $C_{2} = 0$.\nThe potential distribution is then:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = -\\frac{q N_{A}}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} (W-x)^{2}\n$$\nThe total potential drop across this one-sided depletion region is the difference in potential between $x=0$ and $x=W$. Since the potential drop across the heavily doped n-side is negligible, this is approximately the total junction potential, $V_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$\nV_{\\text{total}} = |\\psi(0) - \\psi(W)| = \\left| -\\frac{q N_{A} W^{2}}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} - 0 \\right| = \\frac{q N_{A} W^{2}}{2\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nSolving for the depletion width $W$ gives the general formula for a one-sided abrupt junction:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} V_{\\text{total}}}{q N_{A}}}\n$$\nNow, we apply this result to the source-body and drain-body junctions.\n\n1.  **Source-Body Junction:** The source and body are both at $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$, so the applied reverse bias is $V_{S} - V_{B} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The total potential drop across the junction is just the built-in potential, $V_{\\text{total, S}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}}$. The source-side lateral depletion width, $W_S$, is:\n    $$\n    W_S = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} \\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}}}{q N_{A}}}\n    $$\n2.  **Drain-Body Junction:** The drain is at $V_{D} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and the body is at $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The applied reverse bias is $V_{D} - V_{B} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0\\,\\mathrm{V} = V_D$. The total potential drop is $V_{\\text{total, D}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_{D}$. The drain-side lateral depletion width, $W_D$, is:\n    $$\n    W_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} (\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_{D})}{q N_{A}}}\n    $$\n\n**Punchthrough Condition:**\nPunchthrough occurs when the two lateral depletion regions meet. The critical channel length, $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is the channel length at the onset of this condition, so it is the sum of the two depletion widths.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{crit}} = W_S + W_D\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $W_S$ and $W_D$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} \\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}}}{q N_{A}}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} (\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_{D})}{q N_{A}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}{q N_{A}}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}}} + \\sqrt{\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_{D}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the critical channel length.\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nFirst, we calculate the required intermediate values.\n- Thermal voltage, $V_T$:\n  $$\n  V_{T} = \\frac{k_{B} T}{q} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}\n  $$\n- Built-in potential, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}}$:\n  $$\n  \\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} = V_{T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{A}N_{D}}{n_{i}^{2}}\\right) = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{2}}\\right)\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln(10^{17}) = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (17 \\ln(10)) \\approx 1.01184\\,\\mathrm{V}\n  $$\n- Permittivity of silicon, $\\varepsilon_{s}$:\n  $$\n  \\varepsilon_{s} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\varepsilon_{0} = 11.7 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm}) \\approx 1.03595 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm}\n  $$\n- Pre-factor term in the $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ expression:\n  $$\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}{q N_{A}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.03595 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm})}{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})(1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})}} \\approx 1.1440 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm/V^{1/2}}\n  $$\n- Square root potential terms:\n  $$\n  \\sqrt{\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.01184\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 1.00590\\,\\mathrm{V^{1/2}}\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\sqrt{\\phi_{\\mathrm{bi}} + V_{D}} = \\sqrt{1.01184\\,\\mathrm{V} + 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\sqrt{2.01184\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 1.41840\\,\\mathrm{V^{1/2}}\n  $$\n- Finally, calculate $L_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ in cm:\n  $$\n  L_{\\mathrm{crit}} = (1.1440 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm/V^{1/2}}) \\left( 1.00590\\,\\mathrm{V^{1/2}} + 1.41840\\,\\mathrm{V^{1/2}} \\right)\n  $$\n  $$\n  L_{\\mathrm{crit}} = (1.1440 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\times (2.42430) \\approx 2.7734 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n  $$\n- Convert to nanometers ($1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{nm}$):\n  $$\n  L_{\\mathrm{crit}} = (2.7734 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 277.34\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n  $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $277\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nLet's re-run the calculation with slightly higher precision to check rounding.\n$W_S = 1.1440 \\times 10^{-5} \\times \\sqrt{1.01184} = 1.1506 \\times 10^{-5}$ cm.\n$W_D = 1.1440 \\times 10^{-5} \\times \\sqrt{2.01184} = 1.6226 \\times 10^{-5}$ cm.\n$L_{crit} = W_S + W_D = (1.1506 + 1.6226) \\times 10^{-5} = 2.7732 \\times 10^{-5}$ cm.\nIn nm: $277.32$ nm.\nRounding to three significant figures still gives $277$.\nWait, double checking the pre-factor:\n$2 \\times 1.035949...e-12 / (1.602176...e-19 \\times 1e17) = 1.2931...e-10$.\nsqrt(1.2931...e-10) = 1.1371...e-5 cm/V^1/2.\n$L_{crit} = 1.1371e-5 \\times (\\sqrt{1.01184} + \\sqrt{2.01184}) = 1.1371e-5 \\times (1.00590 + 1.41840) = 1.1371e-5 \\times 2.4243 = 2.7567e-5$ cm.\nIn nm: $275.67$ nm.\nRounding to three significant figures, the correct result is $276$ nm.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe phenomenon of reach-through, or punchthrough, in a BJT occurs when the depletion regions of the emitter-base (EB) and collector-base (CB) junctions expand into the base region and merge. This event eliminates the neutral base, causing the collector potential to directly influence the emitter, thus leading to a loss of current gain and transistor action. The critical condition for reach-through corresponds to the neutral base width becoming zero. Therefore, the minimum physical base width $W_{B,\\min}$ required to prevent reach-through is the sum of the depletion widths extending into the p-type base from the emitter-base junction ($x_{pE}$) and the collector-base junction ($x_{pC}$) under the specified operating biases.\n$$W_{B,\\min} = x_{pE} + x_{pC}$$\nTo find these depletion widths, we must first determine the total potential across each junction.\n\n**1. Calculation of Built-in Potentials ($V_{bi}$)**\nThe built-in potential across an abrupt $p$-$n$ junction is determined by the doping concentrations on either side ($N_{A}$ and $N_{D}$) and the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$V_{bi} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nwhere $V_T = k_B T / e$ is the thermal voltage.\n\nFor the emitter-base ($n^+$-$p$) junction, $N_D = N_E = 2.0 \\times 10^{19} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $N_A = N_B = 1.0 \\times 10^{17} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$V_{bi,E} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_E N_B}{n_i^2}\\right) = (2.5852 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{19})(1.0 \\times 10^{17})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2}\\right)$$\n$$V_{bi,E} = (2.5852 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^{16}) \\approx 0.96996 \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nFor the collector-base ($p$-$n$) junction, $N_A = N_B = 1.0 \\times 10^{17} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $N_D = N_C = 5.0 \\times 10^{16} \\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$V_{bi,C} = V_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_B N_C}{n_i^2}\\right) = (2.5852 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{17})(5.0 \\times 10^{16})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2}\\right)$$\n$$V_{bi,C} = (2.5852 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{V}) \\ln(5.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\approx 0.81534 \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Junction Potentials ($V_j$)**\nThe total potential drop across a junction is $V_j = V_{bi} - V_{applied}$, where $V_{applied}$ is the externally applied voltage ($V_{applied} > 0$ for forward bias).\n\nFor the emitter-base junction, $V_{EB} = 0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$, which implies $V_{BE} = -V_{EB} = 0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$. This is a zero-bias condition.\n$$V_{j,E} = V_{bi,E} - V_{BE} = V_{bi,E} - 0 \\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.96996 \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nFor the collector-base junction, it is reverse-biased at $V_{CB} = 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$. In the notation for junction potential, this corresponds to an applied voltage of $V_{BC} = -V_{CB} = -3.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$V_{j,C} = V_{bi,C} - V_{BC} = V_{bi,C} - (-3.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}) = V_{bi,C} + 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_{j,C} \\approx 0.81534 \\,\\mathrm{V} + 3.0 \\,\\mathrm{V} = 3.81534 \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**3. Derivation and Calculation of Depletion Widths**\nAs per the problem statement, we derive the depletion width from Poisson's equation under the depletion approximation. For a $p$-$n$ junction with metallurgical junction at $x=0$, the charge density $\\rho(x)$ is:\n$$\\rho(x) = \\begin{cases} -e N_A & -x_p < x < 0 \\\\ +e N_D & 0 < x < x_n \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nPoisson's equation is $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}$. Integrating once yields the electric field $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$. With boundary conditions $E(-x_p)=0$ and $E(x_n)=0$, we get:\n$$E(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{eN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x+x_p) & -x_p < x < 0 \\\\ -\\frac{eN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x-x_n) & 0 < x < x_n \\end{cases}$$\nThe total potential $V_j$ is the integral of the electric field across the depletion region:\n$$V_j = -\\int_{-x_p}^{x_n} E(x)\\,dx = \\frac{e}{2\\epsilon_s}(N_A x_p^2 + N_D x_n^2)$$\nThe charge neutrality condition requires $e N_A x_p = e N_D x_n$. Substituting $x_n = (N_A/N_D)x_p$ into the expression for $V_j$ and solving for $x_p$ yields the depletion width on the p-side:\n$$x_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_s V_j}{e} \\frac{N_D}{N_A(N_A + N_D)}}$$\nWe now apply this formula to our two junctions.

            "problem": "A uniformly doped bulk Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) with a short channel can exhibit punchthrough when the source and drain depletion regions merge under drain bias. Consider an $n$-channel device fabricated on a $p$-type silicon body with baseline acceptor doping $N_{A}$, contacted by highly doped $n^{+}$ source and drain regions of donor concentration $N_{D} \\gg N_{A}$. The transistor is biased in the off-state such that the body is depleted across the channel, the source is at $0$ potential, and a reverse drain-to-body bias $V_{D}$ is applied. The temperature is $T$, the intrinsic carrier density is $n_{i}$, the silicon permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{s}$, and the elementary charge is $q$.\n\nAssume:\n- An abrupt one-sided $p$-$n^{+}$ junction on each side, and the depletion approximation holds in the $p$-type body.\n- One-dimensional electrostatics along the channel direction with no generation-recombination in the depletion region.\n- Punchthrough initiates when the sum of the source-side and drain-side depletion widths just equals the physical channel length $L$.\n\nA design mitigation using symmetric pocket (halo) implants increases the local body doping uniformly in a compact sense by $N_{h}$, raising the effective body doping to $N_{\\text{eff}} = N_{A} + N_{h}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the minimum halo implant doping concentration, $N_{h}$, needed to prevent punchthrough in a short-channel MOSFET up to a maximum drain bias $V_{D,\\max}$, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The derivation will be based on first principles, specifically Poisson's equation and the depletion approximation for abrupt, one-sided $p$-$n^{+}$ junctions.\n\nThe core physical model is based on Poisson's equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ to the net charge density $\\rho$ in the semiconductor:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{s}$ is the permittivity of silicon. The problem specifies a one-dimensional analysis along the channel, so the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nWithin the depletion region on the $p$-side of a $p$-$n^{+}$ junction, the depletion approximation assumes that the mobile carrier concentrations are negligible compared to the ionized acceptor concentration. With the halo implant, the effective acceptor concentration is $N_{\\text{eff}} = N_{A} + N_{h}$. Therefore, the charge density in the depletion region is $\\rho(x) = -q N_{\\text{eff}}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge.\nPoisson's equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{q N_{\\text{eff}}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}\n$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $x$ yields the electric field $E(x) = -d\\phi/dx$ and the potential $\\phi(x)$. Let the depletion region extend a width $W$ into the $p$-type body from the metallurgical junction at $x=0$. Applying the boundary condition that the electric field is zero at the edge of the depletion region (at $x=-W$), we find the electric field profile:\n$$\nE(x) = -\\frac{q N_{\\text{eff}}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}(x+W) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad -W \\le x \\le 0\n$$\nThe potential difference across this depletion region, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is found by integrating the electric field from $x=-W$ to $x=0$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{total}} = -\\int_{-W}^{0} E(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-W}^{0} \\frac{q N_{\\text{eff}}}{\\varepsilon_{s}}(x+W) \\, dx = \\frac{q N_{\\text{eff}}}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} W^2\n$$\nSolving for the depletion width $W$ gives the standard expression for a one-sided abrupt junction:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} V_{\\text{total}}}{q N_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nThis formula is applied to both the source and drain junctions. The total potential $V_{\\text{total}}$ across a junction is the sum of the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ and the applied reverse bias. The problem specifies that the source is at $0$ potential and a drain bias $V_D$ is applied.\nFor the source-body junction, the applied reverse bias is zero, so $V_{\\text{total},S} = V_{bi}$. The depletion width $W_S$ is:\n$$\nW_S = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} V_{bi}}{q N_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nFor the drain-body junction, the applied reverse bias is $V_D$, so $V_{\\text{total},D} = V_{bi} + V_D$. The depletion width $W_D$ is:\n$$\nW_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} (V_{bi} + V_D)}{q N_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nPunchthrough occurs when the two depletion regions merge. According to the problem statement, the punchthrough condition is met when the sum of the depletion widths equals the physical channel length $L$:\n$$\nW_S + W_D = L\n$$\nWe want to find the minimum doping $N_h$ required to prevent punchthrough up to a maximum drain bias $V_{D,\\max}$. This means we set the punchthrough condition at $V_D = V_{D,\\max}$.\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} V_{bi}}{q N_{\\text{eff}}}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s} (V_{bi} + V_{D,\\max})}{q N_{\\text{eff}}}} = L\n$$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}{q N_{\\text{eff}}}} \\left( \\sqrt{V_{bi}} + \\sqrt{V_{bi} + V_{D,\\max}} \\right) = L\n$$\nWe can now solve for the effective doping concentration $N_{\\text{eff}}$ required to satisfy this condition:\n$$\n\\sqrt{N_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}{q}} \\left( \\sqrt{V_{bi}} + \\sqrt{V_{bi} + V_{D,\\max}} \\right)\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields:\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}{q L^2} \\left( \\sqrt{V_{bi}} + \\sqrt{V_{bi} + V_{D,\\max}} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimum required halo implant doping, $N_h$. Since $N_{\\text{eff}} = N_{A} + N_{h}$, the minimum $N_h$ is given by:\n$$\nN_{h} = N_{\\text{eff}} - N_{A} = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{s}}{q L^2} \\left( \\sqrt{V_{bi}} + \\sqrt{V_{bi} + V_{D,\\max}} \\right)^2 - N_{A}\n$$\nThis is the derived analytic expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically.
