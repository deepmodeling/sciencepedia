The physical parameters are realistic, and the classical approximation is valid for the given temperature and frequency range. The problem statement is complete and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nAccording to the Johnson–Nyquist theorem, the thermal noise of a resistor $R$ at absolute temperature $T$ can be modeled as a noise voltage source. The problem specifies the use of a one-sided power spectral density (PSD), which describes the noise power distribution over positive frequencies. For a resistor in the classical regime, the one-sided voltage noise PSD, denoted $S_v(f)$, is white (i.e., constant with frequency) and is given by:\n$$ S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R $$\nThe units of $S_v(f)$ are volts-squared per hertz ($\\text{V}^2/\\text{Hz}$).\n\nThis noise voltage is passed through an ideal LTI filter with a frequency response $H(f)$. The PSD of the output voltage, $S_{out}(f)$, is related to the input PSD, $S_v(f)$, by the equation:\n$$ S_{out}(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_v(f) $$\n\nThe mean-square voltage at the output, $\\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle$, is obtained by integrating the output PSD over all frequencies. Since we are using a one-sided PSD, the integration is performed from $f=0$ to $f=\\infty$:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S_{out}(f) \\, df = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 S_v(f) \\, df $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $S_v(f)$ and $|H(f)|$. The noise PSD is $S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R$. The filter is an ideal brick-wall filter with magnitude response $|H(f)| = 1$ for $0 \\le f \\le B$ and $|H(f)| = 0$ for $f  B$. Therefore, $|H(f)|^2$ is a rectangular function:\n$$\n|H(f)|^2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{for } 0 \\le f \\le B \\\\\n0  \\text{for } f  B\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for the mean-square output voltage:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 (4 k_B T R) \\, df $$\nSince $4 k_B T R$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 \\, df $$\nWe now use the definition of the filter response to evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R \\left( \\int_{0}^{B} 1 \\, df + \\int_{B}^{\\infty} 0 \\, df \\right) $$\nThe second integral is zero. The first integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{B} 1 \\, df = [f]_{0}^{B} = B - 0 = B $$\nThus, the mean-square output noise voltage is:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R B $$\n\nThe problem asks for the root-mean-square (RMS) output noise voltage, $v_{\\text{rms}}$, which is the square root of the mean-square voltage:\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{4 k_B T R B} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J}/\\text{K}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n- $R = 1000\\,\\Omega$\n- $B = 100\\,\\text{kHz} = 10^5\\,\\text{Hz}$\n\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 300 \\times 1000 \\times 10^5} $$\nLet's compute the value inside the square root:\n$$ 4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 300 \\times 1000 \\times 10^5 = 4 \\times 1.380649 \\times 3 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 10^2 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^5 $$\n$$ = 12 \\times 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23+2+3+5} = 16.567788 \\times 10^{-13} $$\nThis can be written in a more convenient form for taking the square root:\n$$ 1.6567788 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{V}^2 $$\nNow we take the square root:\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{1.6567788 \\times 10^{-12}} \\,\\text{V} $$\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{1.6567788} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-12}} \\,\\text{V} $$\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} \\approx 1.28715919 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{V} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in microvolts ($\\mu\\text{V}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\text{V} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{V}$.\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} \\approx 1.28715919 \\,\\mu\\text{V} $$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures.

Round your answer to four significant figures and express the result in microvolts.",
            "solution": "The derivation begins from the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT), which provides a general relationship between the fluctuations in a system at thermal equilibrium and its response to external perturbations. For a linear, passive electrical one-port network characterized by an impedance $Z(f)$, the FDT dictates that the spectral density of thermal voltage fluctuations is related to the dissipative part of its impedance, which is the resistance $R(f) = \\text{Re}[Z(f)]$.\n\nIn the general quantum mechanical case, the one-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the open-circuit noise voltage is given by\n$$S_v(f) = 4 R(f) \\frac{hf}{2} \\coth\\left(\\frac{hf}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem specifies a measurement at low frequencies. We verify that the classical limit, $hf \\ll k_B T$, is applicable. For the highest temperature $T_2 = 600\\,\\text{K}$ and the maximum frequency within the bandwidth, which for a center frequency sufficiently low is approximately $f_{\\text{max}} \\approx B = 10.0\\,\\text{MHz} = 1.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Hz}$, we have $hf_{\\text{max}} \\approx (6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s})(1.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 6.626 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\text{J}$.

Since $hf_{\\text{max}} \\ll k_B T_2$, the classical approximation is highly accurate. In this limit, using the Taylor expansion $\\coth(x) \\approx 1/x$ for small $x$, the PSD simplifies to the well-known Johnson-Nyquist formula:\n$$S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R(f)$$\nThe problem states that the resistances are frequency-independent, so we write $R(f)=R$.\n\nThe system consists of two resistive segments in series, $R_1$ at temperature $T_1$ and $R_2$ at temperature $T_2$. This is a non-equilibrium system, as there is no single global temperature. However, the problem specifies that we can apply the FDT locally under conditions of local thermal equilibrium. This means we can model each resistive segment as an independent noise source, where the noise characteristics of each segment are determined by its own resistance and temperature.\n\nWe model the noisy resistor $R_1$ as an ideal noiseless resistor $R_1$ in series with a thermal noise voltage source $v_{n1}(t)$. The one-sided PSD of this source is:\n$$S_{v1}(f) = 4 k_B T_1 R_1$$\nSimilarly, the noisy resistor $R_2$ is modeled as an ideal noiseless resistor $R_2$ in series with a thermal noise voltage source $v_{n2}(t)$, with a one-sided PSD of:\n$$S_{v2}(f) = 4 k_B T_2 R_2$$\nThe total noise voltage across the series combination is the sum of the individual noise voltages: $v_n(t) = v_{n1}(t) + v_{n2}(t)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the noise sources are uncorrelated. Thermal noise arises from the random, thermally-agitated motion of charge carriers within a conductor. As the two resistive segments are physically distinct macroscopic components, the microscopic random fluctuations of charge carriers in segment $1$ are statistically independent of the fluctuations in segment $2$. This lack of correlation between the microscopic stochastic processes is the physical basis for treating the macroscopic noise voltage sources $v_{n1}(t)$ and $v_{n2}(t)$ as uncorrelated random variables. Mathematically, this means their cross-correlation is zero: $\\langle v_{n1}(t) v_{n2}(t+\\tau) \\rangle = 0$ for all $\\tau$.\n\nFor uncorrelated noise sources, the PSD of their sum is the sum of their individual PSDs. Therefore, the total one-sided noise voltage PSD across the series combination is:\n$$S_{v,tot}(f) = S_{v1}(f) + S_{v2}(f) = 4 k_B T_1 R_1 + 4 k_B T_2 R_2$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n$$S_{v,tot}(f) = 4 k_B (T_1 R_1 + T_2 R_2)$$\nThis result is often referred to as the \"sum of Nyquist contributions in a non-isothermal conductor\" or sometimes attributed to Burgess's theorem.\n\nThe total open-circuit mean-square noise voltage, $\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle$, is obtained by integrating the PSD over the specified one-sided measurement bandwidth $B$. Since the PSD is constant (white noise) over the frequency range of interest, this integral simplifies to a multiplication:\n$$\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle = \\int_0^B S_{v,tot}(f) \\, df = S_{v,tot} \\times B$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{v,tot}$, we arrive at the desired expression for the open-circuit mean-square noise voltage:\n$$\\langle v_n^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B B (T_1 R_1 + T_2 R_2)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically.

No contradictions are present.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem requires the derivation of the input-referred gate voltage noise power spectral density, $S_{v_{g}}(f)$. This derivation proceeds in two main steps: first, establishing the expression for the output drain current noise PSD, and second, referring this noise back to an equivalent noise source at the gate.\n\nAccording to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, any dissipative element in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$ will exhibit thermal noise. For a simple resistor with resistance $R$, this manifests as a voltage noise source with PSD $S_v(f) = 4k_BTR$ or a current noise source with PSD $S_i(f) = 4k_BT/R = 4k_BTG$, where $G$ is the conductance and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This noise is \"white,\" meaning its PSD is independent of frequency $f$ over a broad range.\n\nIn a MOSFET operating in saturation, the channel is a distributed resistive element where charge carriers (electrons or holes) are in random thermal motion. This motion gives rise to fluctuations in the drain current, which constitute the thermal channel noise. The problem states this noise is modeled by a current source connected in parallel with the drain-source terminals. The power spectral density of this drain current noise, $S_{i_d}(f)$, is given by a modified form of the Nyquist formula. Instead of using the output conductance $g_{ds}$, the effective noise-generating conductance of the saturated channel is shown to be proportional to the transconductance $g_m$. The expression is:\n$$\nS_{i_d}(f) = 4 k_B T \\gamma g_m\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the dimensionless excess noise factor that accounts for the non-uniform potential and charge distribution along the channel, as well as possible hot-carrier effects. For a long-channel MOSFET in saturation, theory predicts $\\gamma = 2/3$. The noise is white for the specified midband frequencies.\n\nThe next step is to find the equivalent input-referred voltage noise, $v_g$. By definition, this is a fictitious voltage noise source placed in series with the gate of a now-noiseless transistor, such that it produces the exact same noise current at the drain as the original intrinsic noise source.\n\nUsing the small-signal model of the MOSFET, the drain current $i_{d,out}$ produced by a small-signal gate voltage $v_g$ is given by:\n$$\ni_{d,out} = g_m v_g\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the transconductance $g_m$ is considered noiseless for this transformation. To relate the power spectral densities, we use the property that for a linear time-invariant system, the output PSD is the input PSD multiplied by the squared magnitude of the transfer function. In this case, the transfer function from the input voltage noise to the output current noise is $g_m$. Therefore, the PSD of the output current produced by the input-referred source is:\n$$\nS_{i_{d,out}}(f) = |g_m|^2 S_{v_g}(f) = g_m^2 S_{v_g}(f)\n$$\nBy the definition of input-referred noise, this output noise PSD must be equal to the intrinsic drain current noise PSD, $S_{i_d}(f)$.\n$$\nS_{i_{d,out}}(f) = S_{i_d}(f)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the two PSDs:\n$$\ng_m^2 S_{v_g}(f) = 4 k_B T \\gamma g_m\n$$\nTo find the input-referred gate voltage noise PSD, $S_{v_g}(f)$, we solve for it by dividing both sides by $g_m^2$. Since $g_m  0$ for a functioning transistor, this is a valid operation.\n$$\nS_{v_g}(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T \\gamma g_m}{g_m^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final result:\n$$\nS_{v_g}(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T \\gamma}{g_m}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the input-referred gate voltage noise PSD for a MOSFET in saturation, under the given assumptions. The result is independent of frequency $f$, consistent with the white noise model.",
