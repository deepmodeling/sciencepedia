            "solution": "The problem asks for the root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage at the output of an ideal filter connected to a resistor at thermal equilibrium. The derivation begins with the Johnson–Nyquist theorem, which describes the thermal noise generated by a resistor.\n\nFirst, let us validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- Resistor value: $R = 1\\,\\text{k}\\Omega = 1000\\,\\Omega$\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n- Filter type: Ideal linear time-invariant (LTI) brick-wall filter\n- Filter magnitude response: $|H(f)| = 1$ for $0 \\le f \\le B$ and $|H(f)| = 0$ for $f > B$\n- Measurement bandwidth: $B = 100\\,\\text{kHz} = 10^5\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- Physical constant: Boltzmann constant, $k_B=1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J}/\\text{K}$\n- Assumption: The system is in the classical regime, where $hf \\ll k_B T$.\n- Assumption: The resistor's thermal noise is white within the band of interest.\n- Assumption: A one-sided description of power spectral densities is to be used.\n- Objective: Derive and compute the numerical value of the RMS output noise voltage, $v_{\\text{rms}}$, in microvolts, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The physical parameters are realistic, and the classical approximation is valid for the given temperature and frequency range. The problem statement is complete and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nAccording to the Johnson–Nyquist theorem, the thermal noise of a resistor $R$ at absolute temperature $T$ can be modeled as a noise voltage source. The problem specifies the use of a one-sided power spectral density (PSD), which describes the noise power distribution over positive frequencies. For a resistor in the classical regime, the one-sided voltage noise PSD, denoted $S_v(f)$, is white (i.e., constant with frequency) and is given by:\n$$ S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R $$\nThe units of $S_v(f)$ are volts-squared per hertz ($\\text{V}^2/\\text{Hz}$).\n\nThis noise voltage is passed through an ideal LTI filter with a frequency response $H(f)$. The PSD of the output voltage, $S_{out}(f)$, is related to the input PSD, $S_v(f)$, by the equation:\n$$ S_{out}(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_v(f) $$\n\nThe mean-square voltage at the output, $\\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle$, is obtained by integrating the output PSD over all frequencies. Since we are using a one-sided PSD, the integration is performed from $f=0$ to $f=\\infty$:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S_{out}(f) \\, df = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 S_v(f) \\, df $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $S_v(f)$ and $|H(f)|$. The noise PSD is $S_v(f) = 4 k_B T R$. The filter is an ideal brick-wall filter with magnitude response $|H(f)| = 1$ for $0 \\le f \\le B$ and $|H(f)| = 0$ for $f > B$. Therefore, $|H(f)|^2$ is a rectangular function:\n$$\n|H(f)|^2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for } 0 \\le f \\le B \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } f > B\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for the mean-square output voltage:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 (4 k_B T R) \\, df $$\nSince $4 k_B T R$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^2 \\, df $$\nWe now use the definition of the filter response to evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R \\left( \\int_{0}^{B} 1 \\, df + \\int_{B}^{\\infty} 0 \\, df \\right) $$\nThe second integral is zero. The first integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{B} 1 \\, df = [f]_{0}^{B} = B - 0 = B $$\nThus, the mean-square output noise voltage is:\n$$ \\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle = 4 k_B T R B $$\n\nThe problem asks for the root-mean-square (RMS) output noise voltage, $v_{\\text{rms}}$, which is the square root of the mean-square voltage:\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\langle v_{out}^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{4 k_B T R B} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\text{J}/\\text{K}$\n- $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n- $R = 1000\\,\\Omega$\n- $B = 100\\,\\text{kHz} = 10^5\\,\\text{Hz}$\n\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 300 \\times 1000 \\times 10^5} $$\nLet's compute the value inside the square root:\n$$ 4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 300 \\times 1000 \\times 10^5 = 4 \\times 1.380649 \\times 3 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 10^2 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^5 $$\n$$ = 12 \\times 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23+2+3+5} = 16.567788 \\times 10^{-13} $$\nThis can be written in a more convenient form for taking the square root:\n$$ 1.6567788 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{V}^2 $$\nNow we take the square root:\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{1.6567788 \\times 10^{-12}} \\,\\text{V} $$\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{1.6567788} \\times \\sqrt{10^{-12}} \\,\\text{V} $$\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} \\approx 1.28715919 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{V} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in microvolts ($\\mu\\text{V}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\text{V} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{V}$.\n$$ v_{\\text{rms}} \\approx 1.28715919 \\,\\mu\\text{V} $$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures.

Let the transconductance be defined by $g_{m}=\\partial I_{D}/\\partial V_{GS}$ about the operating point.

The use of a transconductance $g_m$ and an excess noise factor $\\gamma$ are standard in semiconductor device modeling. The concept of input-referred noise is a fundamental technique in analog circuit analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a specific quantity, $S_{v_{g}}(f)$, in terms of a clearly defined set of parameters ($k_B$, $T$, $\\gamma$, $g_m$). The method of derivation is explicitly constrained, ensuring a unique path to the solution.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The language is technical and precise, devoid of subjectivity or ambiguity. All terms are standard in the field of electronics and physics.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary information and states its simplifying assumptions clearly (e.g., midband frequency, negligible parasitic resistances). No contradictions are present.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem requires the derivation of the input-referred gate voltage noise power spectral density, $S_{v_{g}}(f)$. This derivation proceeds in two main steps: first, establishing the expression for the output drain current noise PSD, and second, referring this noise back to an equivalent noise source at the gate.\n\nAccording to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, any dissipative element in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$ will exhibit thermal noise. For a simple resistor with resistance $R$, this manifests as a voltage noise source with PSD $S_v(f) = 4k_BTR$ or a current noise source with PSD $S_i(f) = 4k_BT/R = 4k_BTG$, where $G$ is the conductance and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This noise is \"white,\" meaning its PSD is independent of frequency $f$ over a broad range.\n\nIn a MOSFET operating in saturation, the channel is a distributed resistive element where charge carriers (electrons or holes) are in random thermal motion. This motion gives rise to fluctuations in the drain current, which constitute the thermal channel noise. The problem states this noise is modeled by a current source connected in parallel with the drain-source terminals. The power spectral density of this drain current noise, $S_{i_d}(f)$, is given by a modified form of the Nyquist formula. Instead of using the output conductance $g_{ds}$, the effective noise-generating conductance of the saturated channel is shown to be proportional to the transconductance $g_m$. The expression is:\n$$\nS_{i_d}(f) = 4 k_B T \\gamma g_m\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the dimensionless excess noise factor that accounts for the non-uniform potential and charge distribution along the channel, as well as possible hot-carrier effects. For a long-channel MOSFET in saturation, theory predicts $\\gamma = 2/3$. The noise is white for the specified midband frequencies.\n\nThe next step is to find the equivalent input-referred voltage noise, $v_g$. By definition, this is a fictitious voltage noise source placed in series with the gate of a now-noiseless transistor, such that it produces the exact same noise current at the drain as the original intrinsic noise source.\n\nUsing the small-signal model of the MOSFET, the drain current $i_{d,out}$ produced by a small-signal gate voltage $v_g$ is given by:\n$$\ni_{d,out} = g_m v_g\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the transconductance $g_m$ is considered noiseless for this transformation. To relate the power spectral densities, we use the property that for a linear time-invariant system, the output PSD is the input PSD multiplied by the squared magnitude of the transfer function. In this case, the transfer function from the input voltage noise to the output current noise is $g_m$. Therefore, the PSD of the output current produced by the input-referred source is:\n$$\nS_{i_{d,out}}(f) = |g_m|^2 S_{v_g}(f) = g_m^2 S_{v_g}(f)\n$$\nBy the definition of input-referred noise, this output noise PSD must be equal to the intrinsic drain current noise PSD, $S_{i_d}(f)$.\n$$\nS_{i_{d,out}}(f) = S_{i_d}(f)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the two PSDs:\n$$\ng_m^2 S_{v_g}(f) = 4 k_B T \\gamma g_m\n$$\nTo find the input-referred gate voltage noise PSD, $S_{v_g}(f)$, we solve for it by dividing both sides by $g_m^2$. Since $g_m > 0$ for a functioning transistor, this is a valid operation.\n$$\nS_{v_g}(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T \\gamma g_m}{g_m^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final result:\n$$\nS_{v_g}(f) = \\frac{4 k_B T \\gamma}{g_m}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the input-referred gate voltage noise PSD for a MOSFET in saturation, under the given assumptions. The result is independent of frequency $f$, consistent with the white noise model.",
