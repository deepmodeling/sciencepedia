The problem provides this relationship as:\n$$T_j - T_a = R_{\\mathrm{th}}\\,P(T_j)$$\nwhere $T_j$ is the junction temperature, $T_a$ is the ambient temperature, $R_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is the thermal resistance, and $P(T_j)$ is the temperature-dependent power dissipation.

The total derivative $\\frac{d I_C}{d T_j}$ represents how the collector current changes with junction temperature under the fixed external circuit conditions ($V_{GE}$ and $V_{CE}$).\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for $\\frac{d P_{gen}}{d T_j}$:\n$$\\frac{d P_{gen}}{d T_j} = \\frac{d I_C}{d T_j} V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} + I_C \\left( \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial I_C}\\right|_{T_j} \\frac{d I_C}{d T_j} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial T_j}\\right|_{I_C} \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms by factoring out $\\frac{d I_C}{d T_j}$:\n$$\\frac{d P_{gen}}{d T_j} = \\left( V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} + I_C \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial I_C}\\right|_{T_j} \\right) \\frac{d I_C}{d T_j} + I_C \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial T_j}\\right|_{I_C}$$\n\nNow, we can state the neutral-stability condition by equating the slopes of heat generation and removal. This condition defines the critical thermal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}} = \\left( V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} + I_C \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial I_C}\\right|_{T_j} \\right) \\frac{d I_C}{d T_j} + I_C \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial T_j}\\right|_{I_C}$$\nThis is the derived neutral-stability condition. To find the numerical value for $R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$, we evaluate the right-hand side using the small-signal parameters given for the operating point $(I_{C0}, V_{CE0}, T_{j0})$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $I_{C0} = 150\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $V_{CE0} = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial T}\\right|_{I_C} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/K}$\n- $\\left.\\frac{d I_C}{d T}\\right|_{V_{GE},V_{CE}} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{A/K}$\n- $\\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial I_C}\\right|_{T} = 12 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}$\n\nLet's compute the terms on the right-hand side of the expression for $\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}}$.\nThe first term is $\\left( V_{CE0} + I_{C0} \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial I_C}\\right|_{T} \\right) \\left.\\frac{d I_C}{d T}\\right|_{V_{GE},V_{CE}}$.\nThe part inside the parenthesis is:\n$$V_{CE0} + I_{C0} \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial I_C}\\right|_{T} = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{V} + (150\\,\\mathrm{A})(12 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}) = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{V} + 1.8\\,\\mathrm{V} = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nSo, the first term is:\n$$(4.2\\,\\mathrm{V})(0.80\\,\\mathrm{A/K}) = 3.36\\,\\mathrm{W/K}$$\n\nThe second term is $I_{C0} \\left.\\frac{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\partial T}\\right|_{I_C}$.\n$$(150\\,\\mathrm{A})(3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/K}) = 0.525\\,\\mathrm{W/K}$$\n\nNow, we sum the two terms to find the total slope of power generation:\n$$\\frac{d P_{gen}}{d T_j} = 3.36\\,\\mathrm{W/K} + 0.525\\,\\mathrm{W/K} = 3.885\\,\\mathrm{W/K}$$\n\nAt the neutral-stability limit, this slope equals $\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}} = 3.885\\,\\mathrm{W/K}$$\nSolving for $R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1}{3.885}\\,\\mathrm{K/W} \\approx 0.2574002574\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 0.2574\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$$",
