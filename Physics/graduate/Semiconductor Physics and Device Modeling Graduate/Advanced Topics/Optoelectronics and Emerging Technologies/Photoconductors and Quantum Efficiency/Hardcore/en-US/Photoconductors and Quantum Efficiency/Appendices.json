As per my protocol, I will first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Detector quantum efficiency: $\\eta$\n- Integration time: $T$\n- Incident baseline photon flux: $\\Phi$ (photons per second)\n- Noise model: Shot noise is dominant.\n- Statistical distribution: The number of detected counts in one integration follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda=\\eta \\Phi T$.\n- Required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): $\\text{SNR}=3$\n- Change in flux to be detected: $\\Delta \\Phi$\n- Constraint: Small-signal regime, $\\Delta \\Phi \\ll \\Phi$.\n- Definition: The noise level is set by the baseline flux $\\Phi$.\n- Objective: Derive a closed-form analytic expression for the minimal detectable $\\Delta \\Phi$ in terms of $\\eta$, $\\Phi$, and $T$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of quantum optics and signal detection. The use of a Poisson distribution to model photon counting is a standard and fundamental concept. The assumption of shot-noise-limited detection is common and realistic for such experiments.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear objective (derive $\\Delta \\Phi$) with a complete set of parameters ($\\eta$, $\\Phi$, $T$) and a specific constraint ($\\text{SNR}=3$). The small-signal approximation ($\\Delta \\Phi \\ll \\Phi$) clarifies how to define the noise, ensuring a unique solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimal detectable change in flux, $\\Delta \\Phi$, based on a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) criterion. The derivation will be built from the first principles of Poisson counting statistics.\n\n1.  **Mean Detected Counts**: The number of photons detected by the system is a random variable. For an incident photon flux $\\Psi$, a detector quantum efficiency $\\eta$, and an integration time $T$, the mean number of detected counts, $\\lambda$, is given by $\\lambda = \\eta \\Psi T$. This process is described by a Poisson distribution.\n\n2.  **Baseline and Signal Conditions**:\n    -   **Baseline**: With a baseline flux of $\\Phi$, the mean number of detected counts, denoted $\\lambda_b$, is $\\lambda_b = \\eta \\Phi T$.\n    -   **Signal-plus-Baseline**: When the flux increases by a small amount $\\Delta \\Phi$, the total flux becomes $\\Phi + \\Delta \\Phi$. The mean number of detected counts, denoted $\\lambda_s$, is $\\lambda_s = \\eta (\\Phi + \\Delta \\Phi) T$.\n\n3.  **Definition of Signal ($S$)**: In this context, the \"Signal\" is the change in the *expected* number of detected counts resulting from the change in flux $\\Delta \\Phi$. It is the difference between the mean counts with the signal present and the mean counts of the baseline.\n    $$S = \\lambda_s - \\lambda_b$$\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\lambda_s$ and $\\lambda_b$:\n    $$S = \\eta (\\Phi + \\Delta \\Phi) T - \\eta \\Phi T = \\eta \\Phi T + \\eta \\Delta \\Phi T - \\eta \\Phi T$$\n    $$S = \\eta \\Delta \\Phi T$$\n\n4.  **Definition of Noise ($N$)**: For a Poisson process, the variance of the number of counts is equal to its mean. The noise is defined as the standard deviation of the measurement, which is the square root of the variance. The problem states that in the small-signal regime ($\\Delta \\Phi \\ll \\Phi$), the noise level is set by the baseline. Therefore, the noise $N$ is the standard deviation of the baseline count distribution.\n    $$N = \\sigma_{\\text{baseline}} = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\text{counts}_{\\text{baseline}})}$$\n    Since the variance of a Poisson distribution is equal to its mean:\n    $$\\text{Var}(\\text{counts}_{\\text{baseline}}) = \\lambda_b = \\eta \\Phi T$$\n    Thus, the noise is:\n    $$N = \\sqrt{\\eta \\Phi T}$$\n    This is the fundamental shot noise of the baseline measurement.\n\n5.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: The SNR is the ratio of the signal $S$ to the noise $N$.\n    $$\\text{SNR} = \\frac{S}{N} = \\frac{\\eta \\Delta \\Phi T}{\\sqrt{\\eta \\Phi T}}$$\n\n6.  **Solving for Minimal Detectable $\\Delta \\Phi$**: The problem defines the detection limit as the point where $\\text{SNR} = 3$. We set the derived expression for SNR equal to $3$ and solve for $\\Delta \\Phi$.\n    $$3 = \\frac{\\eta \\Delta \\Phi T}{\\sqrt{\\eta \\Phi T}}$$\n    To isolate $\\Delta \\Phi$, we rearrange the equation:\n    $$3 \\sqrt{\\eta \\Phi T} = \\eta \\Delta \\Phi T$$\n    $$\\Delta \\Phi = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\eta \\Phi T}}{\\eta T}$$\n    This expression can be simplified by bringing the denominator terms under the square root:\n    $$\\Delta \\Phi = \\frac{3}{\\eta T} \\sqrt{\\eta \\Phi T} = 3 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta \\Phi T}{(\\eta T)^2}} = 3 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta \\Phi T}{\\eta^2 T^2}}$$\n    Canceling common factors of $\\eta$ and $T$ inside the square root gives the final expression for the minimal detectable change in flux:\n    $$\\Delta \\Phi = 3 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Phi}{\\eta T}}$$\nThis expression represents the smallest change in photon flux that can be distinguished from the baseline noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of $3$ in a single measurement.",

We will address these tasks sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of the Number of Detected Photons, $N_{\\gamma}$**\n\nThe fundamental process is the emission of Cherenkov radiation by a charged particle moving through a dielectric medium with refractive index $n$ at a speed $v$ such that $v > c/n$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The differential number of photons produced per unit path length $dx$ and per unit wavelength $d\\lambda$ is given by the Frank–Tamm formula:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2N_{\\text{prod}}}{dx\\,d\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha}{\\lambda^2} \\sin^2\\theta_c\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha \\approx 1/137.036$ is the fine-structure constant and $\\theta_c$ is the Cherenkov angle, defined by $\\cos\\theta_c = \\frac{1}{n\\beta}$, with $\\beta = v/c$.\n\nThe problem states that the particle is ultra-relativistic, which implies its speed parameter is $\\beta \\approx 1$. The Cherenkov condition $\\beta > 1/n$ is satisfied since $n = 1.0014 > 1$. For $\\beta \\approx 1$, the sine-squared term becomes:\n$$\n\\sin^2\\theta_c = 1 - \\cos^2\\theta_c \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\n$$\nThe spectral yield of produced photons is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2N_{\\text{prod}}}{dx\\,d\\lambda} = \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha}{\\lambda^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\n$$\nThese photons are produced along the particle's trajectory of length $L$ inside the radiator. A photon produced at a depth $x$ must travel the remaining distance $L-x$ to exit the radiator. During this travel, it is subject to absorption, characterized by an absorption length $\\Lambda$. The probability of a photon surviving this path is given by an exponential attenuation factor, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L-x}{\\Lambda}\\right)$.\n\nAfter exiting the radiator, the photon must pass through a window with transmission $T_{\\mathrm{w}}$, be within the geometric acceptance of the imaging system $A_{\\mathrm{g}}$, and finally be detected by a photodetector with a wavelength-dependent quantum efficiency $\\mathrm{QE}(\\lambda)$.\n\nThe differential number of *detected* photons, $dN_{\\gamma}$, from a segment $dx$ at depth $x$ and in a wavelength interval $d\\lambda$ is the product of the number of produced photons and all subsequent efficiency factors:\n$$\ndN_{\\gamma} = \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha}{\\lambda^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L-x}{\\Lambda}\\right) T_{\\mathrm{w}} A_{\\mathrm{g}} \\mathrm{QE}(\\lambda) \\,dx\\,d\\lambda\n$$\nTo find the total number of detected photons, $N_{\\gamma}$, we must integrate this expression over the entire path length of the radiator, from $x=0$ to $x=L$, and over the entire sensitive wavelength range of the detector, from $\\lambda=\\lambda_1$ to $\\lambda=\\lambda_2$:\n$$\nN_{\\gamma} = \\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} \\int_0^L \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha}{\\lambda^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L-x}{\\Lambda}\\right) T_{\\mathrm{w}} A_{\\mathrm{g}} \\mathrm{QE}(\\lambda) \\,dx\\,d\\lambda\n$$\nMost terms are constant with respect to one or both integration variables.
