A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe provided block Hamiltonian for one spin sector is a generic two-band Hamiltonian, which can be expressed in the form $h(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. By comparing with the given expression, we identify the vector $\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left(A k_x, A k_y, M - B|\\mathbf{k}|^2\\right).\n$$\nThe energy eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian are given by $E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\pm |\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})|$, which correspond to the conduction ($+$) and valence ($-$) bands.\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\pm \\sqrt{(A k_x)^2 + (A k_y)^2 + (M - B|\\mathbf{k}|^2)^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{A^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2 + (M - B|\\mathbf{k}|^2)^2}.\n$$\nThe eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are spinors in the two-dimensional orbital basis. Let us denote the basis states as $|\\phi_1\\rangle$ and $|\\phi_2\\rangle$, which are the eigenstates of $\\sigma_z$ with eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$, respectively. These represent the two distinct orbital characters (e.g., electron-like and hole-like). The \"dominant orbital character\" of an energy eigenstate is determined by which of these two basis states has a larger projection weight.\n\nFor a general eigenstate of $h(\\mathbf{k})$, the dominant orbital character is determined by the sign of the $d_z(\\mathbf{k})$ component of the $\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})$ vector. To be precise, for the conduction band eigenstate (with energy $E_+ = +|\\mathbf{d}|$), the population of the $|\\phi_1\\rangle$ state is greater than the $|\\phi_2\\rangle$ state if and only if $d_z > 0$. Conversely, the population of $|\\phi_2\\rangle$ is dominant if $d_z < 0$. The opposite holds for the valence band eigenstate. Therefore, we can track the dominant orbital character of the conduction band by tracking the sign of $d_z(\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nThe problem defines \"band inversion\" as the exchange of this dominant orbital character between two momentum regimes: the center of the Brillouin zone ($\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$) and the large momentum limit ($|\\mathbf{k}| \\to \\infty$). This implies that the sign of $d_z(\\mathbf{k})$ for the conduction band must be different in these two limits.\n\nLet's evaluate $d_z(\\mathbf{k})$ at these two points.\n1.  At the $\\Gamma$ point, $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$:\n    The momentum is zero, so $|\\mathbf{k}|^2 = 0$. The $d_z$ component is:\n    $$\n    d_z(\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}) = M - B(0)^2 = M.\n    $$\n    The sign of the $d_z$ component at the zone center is therefore $\\operatorname{sgn}(M)$.\n\n2.  In the limit of large momentum, $|\\mathbf{k}| \\to \\infty$:\n    The term $B|\\mathbf{k}|^2$ dominates over the constant term $M$. Thus, we can approximate $d_z(\\mathbf{k})$ as:\n    $$\n    d_z(|\\mathbf{k}| \\to \\infty) \\approx -B|\\mathbf{k}|^2.\n    $$\n    Since $|\\mathbf{k}|^2$ is strictly positive for non-zero momentum and $B \\neq 0$, the sign of this expression is determined solely by the sign of $-B$.\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{sgn}\\left(d_z(|\\mathbf{k}| \\to \\infty)\\right) = \\operatorname{sgn}(-B) = -\\operatorname{sgn}(B).\n    $$\n\nFor band inversion to occur, the dominant orbital character must switch. This requires the sign of $d_z(\\mathbf{k})$ to be opposite in the two regimes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(d_z(\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0})\\right) \\neq \\operatorname{sgn}\\left(d_z(|\\mathbf{k}| \\to \\infty)\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting the results from our analysis:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(M) \\neq -\\operatorname{sgn}(B).\n$$\nThis inequality holds if and only if the signs of $M$ and $B$ are the same:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(M) = \\operatorname{sgn}(B).\n$$\nIf two non-zero real numbers have the same sign, their ratio must be positive.\n$$\n\\frac{M}{B} > 0.\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the band gap closes at a finite momentum $|\\mathbf{k}| = \\sqrt{M/B}$ and reopens, which is the hallmark of a topological phase transition driven by band inversion.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $\\operatorname{sgn}(M/B)$. Since the condition for band inversion is $M/B > 0$, the value of the sign function is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\frac{M}{B}\\right) = +1.\n$$",

Let $\\psi(y) = \\phi(y)\\chi$, where $\\chi$ is a constant spinor and $\\phi(y)$ is a scalar function. Substituting this form:\n$$\n(A\\partial_y\\phi(y))\\chi + M(y)\\phi(y)\\sigma_x\\chi = 0\n$$\nThis equation holds if $\\chi$ is an eigenvector of $\\sigma_x$, such that $\\sigma_x\\chi = \\lambda\\chi$, where $\\lambda = \\pm 1$ are the eigenvalues of $\\sigma_x$. The equation for the spatial part $\\phi(y)$ then becomes:\n$$\nA\\frac{d\\phi}{dy} + \\lambda M(y)\\phi = 0\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{\\phi} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{A}M(y)dy\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $y$ gives:\n$$\n\\ln(\\phi(y)) - \\ln(\\phi(0)) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{A}\\int_0^y M(y')dy'\n$$\nThe solution for the spatial envelope is:\n$$\n\\phi(y) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{A}\\int_0^y M(y')dy'\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a normalization constant. The full wavefunction is $\\psi(y) = \\phi(y)\\chi_\\lambda$, where $\\chi_\\lambda$ is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\nFor the state to be a normalizable bound state, the wavefunction must decay to zero as $y \\to \\pm\\infty$. Let us analyze the asymptotic behavior of the exponent. Define the integrated mass term $W(y) = \\int_0^y M(y')dy'$.\n- As $y \\to +\\infty$, $M(y) \\to +M_0 > 0$. Therefore, $W(y) \\sim M_0 y \\to +\\infty$.\n- As $y \\to -\\infty$, $M(y) \\to -M_0 < 0$. Let $y=-z$ with $z>0$. $W(-z) = \\int_0^{-z} M(y')dy'$. For large $z$, $M(y') \\approx -M_0$, so $W(-z) \\approx \\int_0^{-z}(-M_0)dy' = M_0 z = -M_0 y \\to +\\infty$.\n\nIn both limits, $y \\to \\pm\\infty$, the integral $W(y) = \\int_0^y M(y')dy'$ diverges to $+\\infty$.\nThe wavefunction behaves as $\\psi(y) \\sim \\exp(-\\lambda W(y)/A)$. For this to decay to zero in both limits, we must have $\\lambda/A > 0$. Since $A>0$ is given, this forces $\\lambda > 0$. The only positive eigenvalue of $\\sigma_x$ is $\\lambda=+1$.\n\nThus, there exists a unique normalizable bound state, and it must be an eigenstate of $\\sigma_x$ with eigenvalue $+1$. The internal Pauli-matrix structure of this state, which we denote $\\psi_0(y)$, is that of the spinor $\\chi_+$, satisfying $\\sigma_x\\chi_+ = \\chi_+$. A standard choice is $\\chi_+ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The full zero-energy bound state is:\n$$\n\\psi_0(y) = \\mathcal{N} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{A}\\int_0^y M(y')dy'\\right)\\chi_+\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization constant ensuring $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi_0^\\dagger(y)\\psi_0(y)dy = 1$.\n\n**Part 2: Dispersion Relation $E(k_x)$**\n\nNow we consider the full Hamiltonian with $k_x \\neq 0$:\n$$\nH = A\\,k_x\\,\\sigma_x + A\\,k_y\\,\\sigma_y + M(y)\\,\\sigma_z = H_0 + A\\,k_x\\,\\sigma_x\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dispersion $E(k_x)$ obtained by projecting $H$ onto the bound state subspace. Since the zero-energy subspace of $H_0$ is one-dimensional and spanned by $|\\psi_0\\rangle$, the energy of the resulting edge mode is given by the expectation value:\n$$\nE(k_x) = \\langle\\psi_0|H|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_0|H_0 + A\\,k_x\\,\\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle\n$$\nThis can be split into two terms:\n$$\nE(k_x) = \\langle\\psi_0|H_0|\\psi_0\\rangle + \\langle\\psi_0|A\\,k_x\\,\\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle\n$$\nThe first term is zero because $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ is a zero-energy eigenstate of $H_0$:\n$$\n\\langle\\psi_0|H_0|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_0|0 \\cdot |\\psi_0\\rangle = 0\n$$\nThe second term gives the dispersion:\n$$\nE(k_x) = \\langle\\psi_0|A\\,k_x\\,\\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle = A\\,k_x\\langle\\psi_0|\\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle\n$$\nBy construction, $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $\\sigma_x$ with eigenvalue $+1$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle = (+1)|\\psi_0\\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expectation value:\n$$\n\\langle\\psi_0|\\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_0|(+1)|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_0|\\psi_0\\rangle\n$$\nAssuming the state is normalized, $\\langle\\psi_0|\\psi_0\\rangle=1$. Thus, the expectation value is $1$.\nThe projection is considered exact because the perturbation term, $A k_x \\sigma_x$, does not couple the zero-energy bound state to the continuum states of $H_0$. This is a consequence of $H_0$ having a chiral symmetry, as it anticommutes with $\\sigma_x$: $\\{H_0, \\sigma_x\\} = 0$. This ensures the Hamiltonian remains block-diagonal in a basis that separates the zero mode from the continuum, making the projection an exact method to find the low-energy dispersion.\n\nThe final result for the energy dispersion is:\n$$\nE(k_x) = A\\,k_x \\cdot 1 = A\\,k_x\n$$\nThis linear dispersion is the characteristic feature of a single helical Dirac mode at the edge of a topological insulator.",

Due to time-reversal symmetry, there is a pair of counter-propagating states at each edge. We can model this as one spin-polarized channel propagating clockwise (CW) around the sample's perimeter and another spin-polarized channel propagating counter-clockwise (CCW). Each of these channels is ballistic and has a quantized conductance of $G_0 = \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n\nThe contacts are labeled $1, 2, 3, 4$ in CW order.\n- The CW channel connects the contacts in the sequence $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 1$.\n- The CCW channel connects the contacts in the sequence $1 \\to 4 \\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the contacts are ideal and completely equilibrate incoming channels. This means that any particle entering a contact `i` from an edge channel is thermalized to the contact's chemical potential $\\mu_i = -e V_i$. The contact then injects particles into both of its outgoing edge channels (one CW, one CCW) according to this potential.\n\nWe can apply the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The net current $I_i$ flowing from the external lead into contact $i$ is the difference between the current injected by contact $i$ into the sample and the current it absorbs from the sample.\n\nFor contact $i$ at potential $V_i$, it injects a current of $G_0 V_i$ into the CW channel and $G_0 V_i$ into the CCW channel. The total current injected is $2 G_0 V_i$.\nContact $i$ receives current from the CW channel coming from contact $i-1$ (indices are cyclic, so for $i=1$, $i-1=4$) and from the CCW channel coming from contact $i+1$. The total absorbed current is $G_0 V_{i-1} + G_0 V_{i+1}$.\n\nThus, the net current at contact $i$ is:\n$$I_i = 2 G_0 V_i - (G_0 V_{i-1} + G_0 V_{i+1}) = G_0 (2V_i - V_{i-1} - V_{i+1})$$\n\nWe can write a system of four linear equations for the four contacts:\n1. $I_1 = G_0 (2V_1 - V_4 - V_2)$\n2. $I_2 = G_0 (2V_2 - V_1 - V_3)$\n3. $I_3 = G_0 (2V_3 - V_2 - V_4)$\n4. $I_4 = G_0 (2V_4 - V_3 - V_1)$\n\nNow, we apply the specific conditions for this measurement:\n- $I_1 = I$\n- $I_3 = -I$\n- $I_2 = 0$ (contact $2$ is a voltage probe)\n- $I_4 = 0$ (contact $4$ is a voltage probe)\n\nThe equations become:\n1. $\\frac{I}{G_0} = 2V_1 - V_2 - V_4$\n2. $0 = 2V_2 - V_1 - V_3$\n3. $-\\frac{I}{G_0} = 2V_3 - V_2 - V_4$\n4. $0 = 2V_4 - V_1 - V_3$\n\nFrom equation (2), since $I_2 = 0$, we have:\n$$2V_2 = V_1 + V_3$$\nFrom equation (4), since $I_4 = 0$, we have:\n$$2V_4 = V_1 + V_3$$\nComparing these two results, we immediately find:\n$$2V_2 = 2V_4 \\implies V_2 = V_4$$\n\nThis is a key result. The potentials at the two transverse voltage probes are identical.\n\n**Calculation of the Hall Resistance ($R_H$)**\nThe Hall voltage is defined as $V_H = V_2 - V_4$. Based on our finding:\n$$V_H = V_2 - V_2 = 0$$\nThe Hall resistance is therefore:\n$$R_H = \\frac{V_H}{I} = \\frac{0}{I} = 0$$\nThe dimensionless coefficient $r_H$ is:\n$$r_H = 0$$\n\n**Calculation of the Longitudinal Resistance ($R_L$)**\nThe longitudinal voltage is defined as $V_L = V_2 - V_3$. We need to find this potential difference in terms of the current $I$.\nLet's use equation (1) and substitute $V_4 = V_2$:\n$$\\frac{I}{G_0} = 2V_1 - V_2 - V_2 = 2V_1 - 2V_2 = 2(V_1 - V_2)$$\nFrom equation (2), we have the relation $V_1 = 2V_2 - V_3$. We substitute this expression for $V_1$ into the equation for $I$:\n$$\\frac{I}{G_0} = 2((2V_2 - V_3) - V_2) = 2(V_2 - V_3)$$\nNow we can solve for the longitudinal voltage difference $V_L = V_2 - V_3$:\n$$V_L = V_2 - V_3 = \\frac{I}{2G_0}$$\nThe longitudinal resistance is:\n$$R_L = \\frac{V_L}{I} = \\frac{I/(2G_0)}{I} = \\frac{1}{2G_0}$$\nSubstituting the conductance quantum $G_0 = \\frac{e^2}{h}$:\n$$R_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{h}{e^2}$$\nThe dimensionless coefficient $r_L$ is:\n$$r_L = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n**Dependence on Contact Configuration**\nThe problem asks whether the Hall plateau depends on the chosen contact configuration. Our calculation for the specified configuration ($I$ from $1$ to $3$, $V_H$ between $2$ and $4$) yields $R_H = 0$. This is not the universally cited quantized value for the QSH effect. Let us consider an alternative \"standard\" Hall measurement on the same device: current injected at $1$ and extracted at $4$ ($I_1=I, I_4=-I, I_2=I_3=0$), with the Hall voltage measured between $2$ and $3$. In this case, the equations yield $V_2-V_3 = I/(4G_0)$ and $V_2-V_{\\text{other_side}} \\neq 0$. The measured four-terminal resistance depends sensitively on which terminals are used for current and voltage. For example, a configuration with current from $1$ to $4$ and voltage from $2$ to $3$ gives $R = (V_2-V_3)/I = h/(4e^2)$, while another configuration might yield $h/(2e^2)$ or $h/e^2$ under different assumptions about probes. The calculated value of $R_H = 0$ for the given geometry and a non-zero value for others clearly demonstrates that the measured Hall resistance is not a universal constant but depends strongly on the specific four-terminal configuration.",
