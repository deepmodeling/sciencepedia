            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electrostatics and statistical mechanics as applied to semiconductors, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is stated in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$, which is a direct consequence of Gauss's law for electricity:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is the total volume charge density and $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the material. For silicon, we have $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$, where $\\varepsilon_r=11.7$ is the relative permittivity and $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe total charge density in the semiconductor is the sum of contributions from mobile electrons (density $n$), mobile holes (density $p$), ionized donor atoms (density $N_D^+$), and ionized acceptor atoms (density $N_A^-$):\n$$\n\\rho = q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-)\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge.\nThe problem specifies an $n$-type semiconductor, so we assume the acceptor concentration is negligible, $N_A^- \\approx 0$. In an $n$-type material, the majority carriers are electrons, so the hole concentration $p$ is much smaller than the electron concentration $n$ and can be neglected, $p \\approx 0$. The problem also states that donors are fully ionized, so the density of ionized donors equals the total donor concentration, $N_D^+ = N_D$. Under these assumptions, the charge density simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = q(N_D - n(\\mathbf{r}))\n$$\nIt is crucial to note that while the donor concentration $N_D$ is spatially uniform, the electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ varies with position in response to the potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ into Poisson's equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon}(N_D - n(\\mathbf{r}))\n$$\nThe next step is to relate the local electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ to the local potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$. The problem states that the electron gas is nondegenerate. For a nondegenerate semiconductor in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, the carrier concentration follows Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The electron density is given by:\n$$\nn(\\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F_n} - E_i(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_0$ is the equilibrium electron density in the absence of the perturbation (i.e., where $\\phi=0$). In this neutral region, the potential energy reference for electrons is $-q\\phi = 0$. The potential energy of an electron at a point where the potential is $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is $-q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$. Therefore, the electron density becomes:\n$$\nn(\\mathbf{r}) = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nIn the undisturbed, charge-neutral bulk, $n_0$ must balance the positive charge of the ionized donors, so $n_0 = N_D$. Substituting this into the expression for $n(\\mathbf{r})$ yields:\n$$\nn(\\mathbf{r}) = N_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into Poisson's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon}\\left(N_D - N_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nThis is the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The problem asks for the linearized field equation, which is valid for a \"small\" potential perturbation. A small potential is one for which the potential energy is much less than the thermal energy, i.e., $|q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})| \\ll k_B T$. This allows us to use a first-order Taylor expansion for the exponential term, $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$ for small $x$. Letting $x = \\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}$, we get:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx 1 + \\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting this linearization into the Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\left(1 + \\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{q^2 N_D}{\\varepsilon k_B T}\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe resulting linearized field equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) - \\frac{q^2 N_D}{\\varepsilon k_B T}\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is a form of the screened Poisson equation. It describes how the potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is \"screened\" by the mobile electron gas. A typical solution to this equation (e.g., for a point charge source) shows an exponential decay of the form $\\exp(-r/L_D)$, where $L_D$ is the characteristic screening length. By comparing our derived equation to the standard form $\\nabla^2 \\phi - \\frac{1}{L_D^2}\\phi = 0$, we identify the screening length $L_D$ as:\n$$\nL_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{q^2 N_D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 k_B T}{q^2 N_D}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the screening length decreases with increasing doping concentration ($L_D \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_D}$) and increases with temperature ($L_D \\propto \\sqrt{T}$).\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for $L_D$ in silicon at $T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ for the given donor concentrations. The physical constants are:\n- Relative permittivity of Si, $\\varepsilon_r = 11.7$\n- Permittivity of free space, $\\varepsilon_0 \\approx 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_B \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n- Elementary charge, $q \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- Temperature, $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe doping concentrations $N_D$ are given in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and must be converted to $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ by multiplying by $(100\\ \\mathrm{cm/m})^3 = 10^6$:\n- $N_{D1} = 10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 10^{21}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $N_{D2} = 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $N_{D3} = 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 10^{25}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n\nThe numerator of the term inside the square root is constant:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 k_B T = (11.7)(8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m})(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K})(300\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 4.288 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{F \\cdot J/m}\n$$\nThe square of the elementary charge is:\n$$\nq^2 = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C})^2 \\approx 2.566 \\times 10^{-38}\\ \\mathrm{C}^2\n$$\nNow we compute $L_D$ for each case:\n\n1.

The Debye screening length $L_D$ is the fundamental length scale that governs how electric fields penetrate into a conducting medium. Any electrostatic potential variation is screened by the mobile charge carriers (electrons in this case) and decays exponentially with a characteristic length of $L_D$.\n\nOur calculations show a strong dependence of $L_D$ on the doping concentration: $L_D$ ranges from $129.3\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ for light doping ($10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) down to just $1.293\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ for heavy doping ($10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). This has profound implications for semiconductor device engineering, particularly for scaling.\n\nAs devices like MOSFETs are miniaturized, their characteristic dimensions (e.g., gate length) shrink. To maintain proper device operation and prevent \"short-channel effects\"—where the source and drain terminals electrostatically dominate the channel, leading to a loss of control by the gate—it is crucial to confine the electric fields from the source and drain junctions. The extent of these fields is characterized by the depletion region width, which is directly related to the Debye length.\n\nBy increasing the doping concentration (and thus decreasing $L_D$), engineers can create more abrupt junctions with smaller depletion widths. For example, the very small $L_D$ of $1.293\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ in heavily-doped silicon means that any stray potential is screened out over a very short distance, allowing for extremely compact source and drain regions that do not interfere with the transistor's channel. The calculated values clearly demonstrate that as desired device dimensions shrink into the tens of nanometers, doping levels must be in the range of $10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ or higher to ensure electrostatic integrity.\n\nHowever, it is critical to state the assumptions under which these conclusions hold. This derivation relies on the nondegenerate approximation, which assumes the Fermi level is several $k_B T$ away from the band edge. For silicon at $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, this assumption becomes less accurate for doping concentrations approaching and exceeding $\\approx 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Therefore, while the calculation for $N_D = 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ follows from the problem's premises, in a real physical system at this concentration, the semiconductor is degenerate, and a more accurate model using Fermi-Dirac statistics would be required. The general trend of decreasing screening length with increasing doping, however, remains correct and is a cornerstone of modern device design.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the design and evaluation of an adaptive grid refinement strategy for simulating one-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures. The core principle is to tailor the local grid spacing to the local physical length scale, which in this electrostatic context is the Debye screening length, $L_D(x)$. We will first establish the physical and numerical principles, then detail the algorithms for both a uniform and an adaptive grid, and finally define the metric for computational savings.\n\nThe fundamental physical principle is that of Debye screening. In a semiconductor with mobile charge carriers, an electrostatic potential perturbation is screened out over a characteristic distance. This distance, the Debye length, arises from the balance between the electrostatic forces driving carriers and their thermal diffusion. For a nondegenerate semiconductor under the Boltzmann approximation, the electron density $n(x)$ is related to the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$ and temperature $T$ by $n(x) \\propto \\exp(q\\phi(x)/k_B T)$. Linearizing this response for a small potential perturbation about an equilibrium density $n_{eq}$ leads to Poisson's equation in the form $\\nabla^2\\phi - \\phi/L_D^2 = 0$. The characteristic length $L_D$ is given by:\n$$L_D(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon(x) k_B T}{q^2 n(x)}}$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon(x)$ is the local electrical permittivity, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $n(x)$ is the local equilibrium electron density. The problem specifies using the approximations $\\varepsilon(x) = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r(x)$ and $n(x) \\approx N_D(x)$, where $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\\varepsilon_r(x)$ is the relative permittivity, and $N_D(x)$ is the donor doping concentration. Thus, our working formula is:\n$$L_D(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r(x) k_B T}{q^2 N_D(x)}}$$\n\nThe numerical principle informing the grid design is that the local grid spacing $h(x)$ must be sufficiently small to accurately resolve variations in the solution. Since the potential varies on the scale of $L_D(x)$, a common heuristic in numerical simulations is to set the local grid spacing to be a fraction of this characteristic length, i.e., $h(x) \\approx \\beta L_D(x)$ for some factor $\\beta  1$. This ensures that there are several grid points within each Debye length, which is crucial for the accuracy of numerical methods like finite differences or finite volumes.\n\nFirst, we define a baseline uniform grid for comparison. A uniform grid must use a single spacing $h_{\\mathrm{uni}}$ throughout the entire domain $[0,L]$. To ensure adequate resolution everywhere, this spacing must be chosen to resolve the smallest physical length scale present in the problem. This corresponds to the minimum Debye length, $L_{D,\\min}$, which occurs where the term $\\varepsilon_r(x)/N_D(x)$ is minimal. As $N_D(x)$ typically varies over much larger orders of magnitude than $\\varepsilon_r(x)$, the minimum Debye length is found where the doping concentration $N_D(x)$ is maximum.\nLet $L_{D,\\min} = \\min_{x\\in[0,L]} L_D(x)$. The uniform grid spacing is then set as:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{uni}} = \\beta L_{D,\\min}$$\nThe number of grid intervals required to span the domain of length $L$ is $N_{\\mathrm{int,uni}} = \\lceil L / h_{\\mathrm{uni}} \\rceil$. Including both endpoints, the total number of nodes in the uniform grid is:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{uni}} = N_{\\mathrm{int,uni}} + 1$$\n\nNext, we design the adaptive grid. This approach avoids the inefficiency of using a globally fine mesh when only small regions of the domain require it. The grid is generated iteratively, starting from $x_0=0$. The step size $h_i$ to get from node $x_i$ to $x_{i+1}$ is determined by a set of rules:\n1.  **Local physics constraint**: The step size is primarily determined by the local Debye length: $h_{\\mathrm{prop}}(x_i) = \\beta L_D(x_i)$.\n2.  **Growth rate constraint**: To maintain numerical stability and low discretization error, the size of adjacent grid cells should not change too abruptly. This is enforced by limiting the step size $h_i$ relative to the previous step $h_{i-1}$: $h_i \\le r \\cdot h_{i-1}$, where $r>1$ is the maximum growth factor.\n3.  **Maximum size constraint**: A global upper bound $h_{\\max}$ is applied to the step size, ensuring a minimum level of resolution everywhere.\n\nCombining these constraints, the step size from a node at position $x_i$ is calculated as:\n$$h_i = \\min\\left(\\beta L_D(x_i), r \\cdot h_{i-1}, h_{\\max}\\right)$$\nFor the first step from $x_0=0$, the previous step size $h_{-1}$ is initialized to $h_{\\mathrm{prev}} = \\beta L_D(0)$, as specified. The node positions are generated via $x_{i+1} = x_i + h_i$. This process continues until the domain end $L$ is reached. To ensure the grid terminates exactly at $L$, if a calculated step $x_i + h_i$ would exceed $L$, the last node is placed precisely at $L$. The total number of nodes generated constitutes $N_{\\mathrm{adap}}$.\n\nFinally, the computational savings of the adaptive grid relative to the uniform grid is quantified by the fractional reduction in the number of nodes:\n$$S = 1 - \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{adap}}}{N_{\\mathrm{uni}}}$$\nA positive value of $S$ indicates that the adaptive grid is more efficient, requiring fewer computational nodes to satisfy the local resolution requirements across the domain. The implementation will involve defining functions for the spatially varying properties $\\varepsilon_r(x)$ and $N_D(x)$ for each test case, and then executing the described algorithms to compute $N_{\\mathrm{uni}}$, $N_{\\mathrm{adap}}$, and $S$.",
