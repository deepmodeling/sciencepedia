The front gate voltage is applied relative to the back gate. The front gate oxide has thickness $t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, the silicon film has thickness $t_{\\mathrm{si}}$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and the buried oxide (BOX) has thickness $t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$.\n\nYou may assume the following:\n- Quasi-static conditions and uniformly distributed, one-dimensional normal fields, neglecting fringing fields and quantum confinement.\n- Linear, homogeneous dielectrics with $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{f}$, where $\\rho_{f}$ is the free charge density.\n- In strong inversion, the silicon film interior is fully depleted of mobile carriers and any inversion charge is confined to an infinitesimally thin sheet at the front interface.\n- In accumulation, the front interface hosts an infinitesimally thin sheet of majority carriers whose response screens the normal electric field inside the silicon film.\n\nStarting from Gauss’s law and the continuity conditions for the normal component of electric displacement across interfaces, derive how the applied front gate voltage divides across the front gate oxide, the silicon film, and the buried oxide in the two regimes:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the voltage division across a fully depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FD-SOI) MOSFET stack in two distinct operating regimes: accumulation and inversion. We will then calculate the fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across the silicon film for each case.\n\nLet us define a one-dimensional coordinate system, $z$, perpendicular to the layers, with $z=0$ at the front gate/oxide interface. The front gate is at potential $V_G$, and the back gate (handle wafer) is grounded, $V_{BG}=0$. The interfaces are located at:\n-   Front oxide/silicon interface: $z = t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$\n-   Silicon/buried oxide interface: $z = t_{\\mathrm{ox}} + t_{\\mathrm{si}}$\n-   Buried oxide/back gate interface: $z = t_{\\mathrm{ox}} + t_{\\mathrm{si}} + t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$\n\nThe total applied voltage $V_G$ is divided across the three dielectric layers:\n$$V_G = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$ are the potential drops across the front gate oxide, silicon film, and buried oxide, respectively.\n\nUnder the one-dimensional approximation with no charge in the bulk of the dielectrics, the electric field $E$ is constant within each layer. The voltage drop across a layer of thickness $t$ is $\\Delta V = E \\cdot t$. The electric displacement field is $D = \\epsilon E$. We can express the voltage drop in terms of the displacement field $D$ and the capacitance per unit area of each layer, $C = \\epsilon/t$:\n$$ \\Delta V = E \\cdot t = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon} \\cdot t = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon/t} = \\frac{D}{C} $$\nThus, the voltage drops are:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}, \\quad \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{si}}}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}}, \\quad \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{BOX}}}{C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} $$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}/t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}/t_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}/t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$.\n\nWe now analyze the two specified regimes based on the problem's assumptions.\n\n**1. Accumulation at the Front Interface**\n\nThe problem states that in accumulation, the sheet of majority carriers at the front interface \"screens the normal electric field inside the silicon film.\" This is an idealized statement implying that the mobile accumulation charge effectively terminates the electric field lines originating from the front gate. This screening means the electric field inside the silicon film must be zero:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0 $$\nConsequently, the electric displacement field in the silicon is also zero:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} E_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0 $$\nThe voltage drop across the silicon film is therefore zero:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} = E_{\\mathrm{si}} \\cdot t_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0 $$\nThe fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across the silicon film in accumulation is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\frac{0}{V_G} = 0 $$\nThis is an exact result based on the ideal screening assumption.\n\n**2. Inversion at the Front Interface**\n\nIn this regime, the problem states the silicon film is \"fully depleted.\" This means the film is devoid of mobile charge carriers and behaves as a simple, uniform dielectric. Although an inversion charge sheet exists at the front interface, the voltage division across the bulk of the layers is determined by the series combination of their capacitances. In this simplified electrostatic model, we consider the stack as three capacitors in series between the front and back gates.\n\nFor capacitors in series, the displacement field $D$ is constant throughout the stack, assuming no net charge at the internal interfaces (a consequence of the \"fully depleted\" idealization for the bulk potential division).\n$$ D = D_{\\mathrm{ox}} = D_{\\mathrm{si}} = D_{\\mathrm{BOX}} $$\nThe total voltage $V_G$ is the sum of the voltage drops across the series capacitors:\n$$ V_G = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{ox}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} + \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} + \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} $$\n$$ V_G = D \\left( \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} + \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} \\right) $$\nThe voltage drop across the silicon film is:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}} = \\frac{D}{C_{\\mathrm{si}}} $$\nThe fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across the silicon film is the ratio of the potential drop across silicon to the total potential drop:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{D/C_{\\mathrm{si}}}{D \\left( C_{\\mathrm{ox}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{si}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}^{-1} \\right)} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{si}}^{-1}}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{si}}^{-1} + C_{\\mathrm{BOX}}^{-1}} $$\nSubstituting $C^{-1} = t/\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} + t_{\\mathrm{si}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} + t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}/\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given parameters:\n-   $t_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n-   $t_{\\mathrm{si}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} = 11.7\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n-   $t_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = 3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\n\nThe vacuum permittivity $\\epsilon_0$ will cancel from the numerator and denominator.\n$$ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}/\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{1.8}{3.9} \\approx 0.461538\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n$$ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{si}}}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}/\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{8.0}{11.7} \\approx 0.683761\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n$$ \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}}{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BOX}}/\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{150}{3.9} \\approx 38.461538\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe fraction becomes:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{si}}}{V_G} \\right)_{\\mathrm{inv}} = \\frac{0.683761}{0.461538 + 0.683761 + 38.461538} = \\frac{0.683761}{39.606837} \\approx 0.0172637 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.01726$.\n\nThe two fractions are $0$ for the accumulation regime and $0.01726$ for the inversion regime.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in semiconductor device physics that asks for the derivation of the transconductance of a long-channel Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) MOSFET. All necessary parameters and starting principles are provided.\n\nThe derivation of the front-gate transconductance, $g_{m} \\equiv \\partial I_{D} / \\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$, proceeds in three main steps:\n1.  Derive the drain current $I_D$ by integrating the drift current along the channel.\n2.  Establish the relationship between the inversion charge $Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}$ and the gate voltages ($V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{GB}}$) and the silicon potential $\\psi$ using the capacitive model of the device.\n3.  Differentiate the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the front-gate voltage $V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ to obtain $g_m$.\n\nStep 1: Drain Current $I_D$\nThe drain current $I_D$ in a MOSFET is driven by the drift of inversion charge carriers in the channel. For a device of width $W$ with carrier mobility $\\mu$, the drift current at a position $y$ along the channel is given by:\n$$I_D = W \\mu [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)] E(y)$$\nwhere $-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)$ is the mobile inversion charge per unit area (a positive quantity for an n-channel MOSFET) and $E(y) = dV/dy$ is the local electric field, with $V(y)$ being the channel quasi-Fermi potential. Substituting for $E(y)$:\n$$I_D = W \\mu [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)] \\frac{dV}{dy}$$\nWe can separate variables and integrate along the channel from the source ($y=0$, $V=0$) to the drain ($y=L$, $V=V_D$):\n$$I_D \\int_0^L dy = W \\mu \\int_0^{V_D} [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(V)] dV$$\nAs $I_D$ is constant along the channel in steady state, this becomes:\n$$I_D L = W \\mu \\int_0^{V_D} [-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(V)] dV$$\nLet $Q_n(y) = -Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(y)$ be the mobile electron charge per unit area (a positive quantity). The charge $Q_n$ is a function of the difference between the silicon potential and the local quasi-Fermi potential. For a long-channel device, we can assume $\\psi \\approx \\psi_s$ (the source-end potential) is constant along the channel. Thus, $Q_n$ depends on $V$ as $Q_n(\\psi_s - V)$. To evaluate the integral for $I_D$, we linearize $Q_n(V)$ around the source ($V=0$):\n$$Q_n(V) \\approx Q_n(V=0) + \\left. \\frac{\\partial Q_n}{\\partial V} \\right|_{V=0} V$$\nwhere $Q_n(V=0) = Q_{n,s}$ is the charge density at the source. The derivative is:\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial Q_n}{\\partial V} \\right|_{V=0} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial Q_n(\\psi_s - V)}{\\partial V} \\right|_{V=0} = \\frac{\\partial Q_n}{\\partial (\\psi_s-V)} \\frac{d(\\psi_s-V)}{dV} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial Q_n}{\\partial \\psi}\\right|_{\\psi=\\psi_s} (-1) = -C_q$$\nThis uses the definition $C_q \\equiv \\partial Q_n / \\partial \\psi = -\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}/\\partial\\psi$. This shows that the mobile charge decreases towards the drain, as expected. So, the linearization is:\n$$[-Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}(V)] = Q_n(V) \\approx Q_{n,s} - C_q V$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $I_D$:\n$$I_D L = W \\mu \\int_0^{V_D} (Q_{n,s} - C_q V) dV = W \\mu \\left[ Q_{n,s}V - \\frac{1}{2}C_q V^2 \\right]_0^{V_D}$$\n$$I_D = \\frac{W\\mu}{L} \\left( Q_{n,s}V_D - \\frac{1}{2}C_q V_D^2 \\right)$$\n\nStep 2: Relation between Charge and Gate Voltage\nThe FDSOI device can be modeled as a network of capacitors. The problem directs us to use Gauss's law and charge neutrality. For the entire MOS structure, the sum of charges must be zero. Let $Q_{Gf}$ and $Q_{Gb}$ be the charges on the front and back gates, and $Q_{si}$ be the charge in the silicon film.\n$$Q_{Gf} + Q_{Gb} + Q_{si} = 0$$\nThe gate charges are $Q_{Gf} = C_f(V_{\\mathrm{GF}} - \\psi)$ and $Q_{Gb} = C_b(V_{\\mathrm{GB}} - \\psi)$. The silicon charge is $Q_{si} = Q_{\\mathrm{inv}} + Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$, where $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ is the fixed depletion charge in the fully depleted film.\n$$C_f(V_{\\mathrm{GF}} - \\psi) + C_b(V_{\\mathrm{GB}} - \\psi) + Q_{\\mathrm{inv}} + Q_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 0$$\nTo find the relationship between small-signal changes, we differentiate this equation with respect to $V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$, holding $V_{\\mathrm{GB}}$ constant. This is evaluated at the source end, where $\\psi=\\psi_s$. We treat $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ as a constant.\n$$C_f\\left(1 - \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}\\right) + C_b\\left(0 - \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = 0$$\nWe relate $\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ to $\\partial \\psi_s/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ using the chain rule and the definition of $C_q$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = \\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial \\psi_s} \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = -C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the differentiated charge-balance equation:\n$$C_f - C_f \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} - C_b \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} - C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = 0$$\n$$C_f = (C_f + C_b + C_q) \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nThis gives the change in silicon potential with respect to the front-gate voltage:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = \\frac{C_f}{C_f + C_b + C_q}$$\nWe are interested in the change of the mobile charge $Q_{n,s} = -Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = \\frac{\\partial (-Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s})}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = -\\frac{\\partial Q_{\\mathrm{inv},s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = - \\left( -C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} \\right) = C_q \\frac{\\partial \\psi_s}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\partial \\psi_s/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} = C_q \\left( \\frac{C_f}{C_f + C_b + C_q} \\right) = \\frac{C_f C_q}{C_f + C_b + C_q}$$\n\nStep 3: Transconductance $g_m$\nThe front-gate transconductance is defined as $g_m = \\partial I_D / \\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$. We differentiate the expression for $I_D$ from Step 1:\n$$g_m = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} \\left[ \\frac{W\\mu}{L} \\left( Q_{n,s}V_D - \\frac{1}{2}C_q V_D^2 \\right) \\right]$$\n$$g_m = \\frac{W\\mu}{L} \\left( V_D \\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} - \\frac{1}{2}V_D^2 \\frac{\\partial C_q}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}} \\right)$$\nThe problem gives $C_q$ as a parameter for the final expression, which implies it should be treated as a constant for the purpose of this differentiation. This is a standard approximation in this context. Therefore, we set $\\partial C_q / \\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}} = 0$. The expression for $g_m$ simplifies to:\n$$g_m = \\frac{W\\mu V_D}{L} \\frac{\\partial Q_{n,s}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}}$$\nNote that this is the same result that would be obtained by using the linear approximation for the current, $I_D \\approx (W\\mu/L)Q_{n,s}V_D$, valid for small $V_D$.\nFinally, we substitute the result for $\\partial Q_{n,s}/\\partial V_{\\mathrm{GF}}$ from Step 2:\n$$g_m = \\frac{W\\mu V_D}{L} \\left( \\frac{C_f C_q}{C_f + C_b + C_q} \\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the transconductance in terms of the given parameters.",

Using this approximation inside the bracket gives the first-order result:\n$$\\Delta T \\approx \\epsilon T_0 (1 + 0)^{-m} = \\epsilon T_0$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\Delta T \\approx \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{D} I_{D0}}{T_{0}}\\right) T_0 = R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{D} I_{D0}$$\n\nNext, we find the first-order expression for the mobility reduction factor, $\\frac{\\mu(T)}{\\mu_{0}}$.\n$$\\frac{\\mu(T)}{\\mu_{0}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-m}$$\nUsing a first-order binomial expansion $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$ for small $x = \\Delta T / T_0$:\n$$\\frac{\\mu(T)}{\\mu_{0}} \\approx 1 - m \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}$$\nSubstituting our first-order expression for $\\Delta T$:\n$$\\frac{\\mu(T)}{\\mu_{0}} \\approx 1 - m \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{D} I_{D0}}{T_{0}}$$\n\nFinally, we find the self-heating corrected drain current $I_{D}$. From the problem definition, $I_{D} = I_{D0} \\frac{\\mu(T)}{\\mu_{0}}$.\nUsing the first-order expression for the mobility reduction factor:\n$$I_{D} \\approx I_{D0}\\left(1 - m \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{D} I_{D0}}{T_{0}}\\right)$$\nThis set of three expressions is self-consistent to first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe final results are:\n1. Self-heating corrected drain current $I_{D}$: $I_{D0}\\left(1 - m \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{D} I_{D0}}{T_{0}}\\right)$\n2.
