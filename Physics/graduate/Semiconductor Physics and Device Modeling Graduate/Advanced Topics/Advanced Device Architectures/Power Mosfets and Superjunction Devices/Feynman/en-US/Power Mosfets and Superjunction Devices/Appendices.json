The analysis relies on the Poisson equation and the depletion approximation, which are fundamental principles of device physics. The provided values for doping concentrations, dimensions, critical field, and breakdown voltage are realistic for silicon-based power MOSFETs. A critical condition for ideal SJ operation is lateral charge balance. The problem both states this as a premise (\"the lateral charge is balanced\") and provides data that are consistent with it. We verify this consistency:\n    -   The charge per unit area in the n-column is $Q'_{n} = q N_{D} w_{n}$.\n    -   The charge per unit area in the p-column is $Q'_{p} = q N_{A} w_{p}$.\n    -   Charge balance requires $Q'_{n} = Q'_{p}$, which simplifies to $N_{D} w_{n} = N_{A} w_{p}$.\n    -   Let's check this with the given values. First, we must use consistent units, so we convert widths to cm: $w_{n} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$ and $w_{p} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$.\n    -   $N_{D} w_{n} = (1.05 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}) = 1.26 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$.\n    -   $N_{A} w_{p} = (7.00 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}) \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}) = 1.26 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$.\n    -   Since $N_{D} w_{n} = N_{A} w_{p}$, the provided data are internally consistent with the stated condition of charge balance.\n-   **Well-Posedness and Objectivity**: The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to determine the thickness $W$. The explicit statement about the flat vertical electric field, which is a direct consequence of the charge balance, makes the problem solvable. The language is objective and precise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, internally consistent, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the total depleted epitaxial thickness $W$ of a superjunction drift region required to support a breakdown voltage $BV$ of $650\\,\\text{V}$.\n\nThe starting point is the Poisson equation, which relates the divergence of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ to the net space charge density $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{s}}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{s}$ is the permittivity of silicon. In the off-state, the drift region is fully depleted of mobile carriers, so the space charge density is determined by the ionized dopants. In the n-columns, $\\rho = q N_{D}$, and in the p-columns, $\\rho = -q N_{A}$, where $q$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe problem states that the vertical behavior dominates and that the electric field is spatially flat in the vertical direction. Let us denote the vertical direction by $y$. The statement implies that the vertical component of the electric field, $E_{y}$, is constant with respect to $y$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial E_{y}}{\\partial y} = 0$. We now demonstrate that this is a direct consequence of the charge balance condition.\n\nConsider a thin horizontal slice of the drift region with thickness $dy$ and spanning one lateral period of width $w_{n} + w_{p}$. The total charge $dQ$ in this volume element is the sum of the charge in the n-column and p-column sections:\n$$\ndQ = (q N_{D} \\cdot w_{n} \\cdot L - q N_{A} \\cdot w_{p} \\cdot L) dy\n$$\nwhere $L$ is an arbitrary length in the third dimension. The average space charge density $\\rho_{\\text{avg}}$ in this slice is the total charge $dQ$ divided by the volume of the slice, $dV = (w_{n} + w_{p}) \\cdot L \\cdot dy$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{dQ}{dV} = \\frac{q (N_{D} w_{n} - N_{A} w_{p}) L \\, dy}{(w_{n} + w_{p}) L \\, dy} = \\frac{q (N_{D} w_{n} - N_{A} w_{p})}{w_{n} + w_{p}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies perfect lateral charge balance, which means $N_{D} w_{n} = N_{A} w_{p}$. Substituting this into the expression for the average charge density gives:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{avg}} = 0\n$$\nSince the problem assumes the one-dimensional vertical behavior is dominant, we can analyze the macroscopic vertical field profile using this averaged charge density. The one-dimensional Poisson equation in the vertical direction is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{y}}{dy} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{avg}}}{\\epsilon_{s}}\n$$\nWith $\\rho_{\\text{avg}} = 0$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{y}}{dy} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y$ yields $E_{y}(y) = \\text{constant}$. This confirms the problem's premise of a spatially flat (uniform) vertical electric field, which is a hallmark of an ideal superjunction structure.\n\nBreakdown occurs when the magnitude of the electric field at any point in the semiconductor reaches the critical field, $E_{c}$. Since $E_{y}$ is constant throughout the drift region of thickness $W$, at the breakdown voltage $BV$, the electric field must be equal to $E_{c}$ everywhere along the vertical axis.\n$$\nE_{y} = E_{c}\n$$\nThe breakdown voltage $BV$ is defined as the integral of the electric field magnitude across the drift region from one terminal to the other (from $y=0$ to $y=W$):\n$$\nBV = \\int_{0}^{W} E_{y}(y) \\, dy\n$$\nSubstituting the constant field $E_{y} = E_{c}$:\n$$\nBV = \\int_{0}^{W} E_{c} \\, dy = E_{c} \\int_{0}^{W} dy = E_{c} W\n$$\nThis linear relationship between breakdown voltage and drift region thickness is the defining advantage of the superjunction concept over a conventional, uniformly doped drift region.\n\nWe can now solve for the required thickness $W$:\n$$\nW = \\frac{BV}{E_{c}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $BV = 650\\,\\text{V}$\n-   $E_{c} = 2.8 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{V}/\\text{cm}$\n\n$$\nW = \\frac{650\\,\\text{V}}{2.8 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{V}/\\text{cm}} \\approx 0.0023214\\,\\text{cm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$). Since $1\\,\\text{cm} = 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$\nW \\approx 0.0023214\\,\\text{cm} \\times \\frac{10^{4}\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{1\\,\\text{cm}} \\approx 23.214\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\nW \\approx 23.2\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nThe other parameters ($w_{n}$, $w_{p}$, $N_{D}$, $N_{A}$) were essential for validating the premise of the problem—that is, confirming the charge balance condition which leads to the uniform vertical electric field. Once this physical model is established, the calculation of $W$ depends only on $BV$ and $E_{c}$.",

This energy corresponds to the electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor, which is dissipated as heat during the subsequent discharge transition in a hard-switched topology.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for the work, $dW$, required to move an infinitesimal charge, $dq$, against an electric potential, $v'$, is given by:\n$$dW = v' \\, dq$$\nThe total work done, $E$, to charge the capacitor from a voltage of $0$ to $V$ is the integral of this expression. This work is stored as potential energy in the electric field of the capacitor.\n$$E = \\int dW = \\int_{q(0)}^{q(V)} v' \\, dq$$\nThe problem provides the relationship between charge and voltage for the nonlinear capacitor: $dq = C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v') \\, dv'$. We can use this to change the variable of integration from charge $q$ to voltage $v'$. The limits of integration for the voltage are from $0$ to $V$.\n$$E = \\int_0^V v' C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v') \\, dv'$$\nThis is the general expression for the energy stored in the nonlinear output capacitance when charged to a voltage $V$.\n\nNext, we apply this general expression to the specific functional form of $C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(V)$ given for the superjunction MOSFET:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v') = C_{a}\\left(1+\\frac{v'}{V_{a}}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} + C_{b}\\left(1+\\frac{v'}{V_{b}}\\right)^{-1}$$\nSubstituting this into the energy integral gives:\n$$E = \\int_0^V v' \\left[ C_{a}\\left(1+\\frac{v'}{V_{a}}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} + C_{b}\\left(1+\\frac{v'}{V_{b}}\\right)^{-1} \\right] dv'$$\nWe can separate this into two integrals, $E = E_a + E_b$:\n$$E_a = C_a \\int_0^V v' \\left(1+\\frac{v'}{V_{a}}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} dv'$$\n$$E_b = C_b \\int_0^V v' \\left(1+\\frac{v'}{V_{b}}\\right)^{-1} dv'$$\n\nTo solve the integral for $E_a$, we perform a substitution.

Thus, $N_{A} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(N_{0}, \\sigma_{N}^{2})$.\n- $N_{D}$ and $N_{A}$ are independent random variables.\n- The target concentration is $N_{0} = 1 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n\nThe charge-balance criterion is given by the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{|N_{D}-N_{A}|}{N_{0}}\\leq 0.02\n$$\nWe are asked to find the probability of this event occurring.\n\nTo solve this, we define a new random variable $X$ as the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations:\n$$\nX = N_{D} - N_{A}\n$$\nThe charge-balance criterion can be rewritten in terms of $X$:\n$$\n\\frac{|X|}{N_{0}} \\leq 0.02 \\implies |X| \\leq 0.02 N_{0} \\implies -0.02 N_{0} \\leq X \\leq 0.02 N_{0}\n$$\nThe problem is now to calculate the probability $P(-0.02 N_{0} \\leq X \\leq 0.02 N_{0})$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability distribution of $X$. Since $N_{D}$ and $N_{A}$ are independent Gaussian random variables, their difference $X$ is also a Gaussian random variable. The parameters of the distribution for $X$ are found as follows:\nThe mean of $X$, denoted $\\mu_{X}$, is:\n$$\n\\mu_{X} = E[X] = E[N_{D} - N_{A}] = E[N_{D}] - E[N_{A}] = N_{0} - N_{0} = 0\n$$\nThe variance of $X$, denoted $\\sigma_{X}^{2}$, is (due to independence):\n$$\n\\sigma_{X}^{2} = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(N_{D} - N_{A}) = \\mathrm{Var}(N_{D}) + \\mathrm{Var}(N_{A}) = \\sigma_{N}^{2} + \\sigma_{N}^{2} = 2\\sigma_{N}^{2}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of $X$ is therefore $\\sigma_{X} = \\sqrt{2\\sigma_{N}^{2}} = \\sigma_{N}\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the random variable $X$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $2\\sigma_{N}^{2}$:\n$$\nX \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 2\\sigma_{N}^{2})\n$$\nThe probability we need to find is given by the integral of the probability density function (PDF) of $X$, $f_{X}(x)$, over the specified interval:\n$$\nP(-0.02 N_{0} \\leq X \\leq 0.02 N_{0}) = \\int_{-0.02 N_{0}}^{0.02 N_{0}} f_{X}(x) dx\n$$\nwhere the PDF for $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{X}, \\sigma_{X}^{2})$ is:\n$$\nf_{X}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{X}\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_{X})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{X}^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(\\sigma_{N}\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2(2\\sigma_{N}^{2})}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{N}\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{4\\sigma_{N}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability is:\n$$\nP = \\int_{-0.02 N_{0}}^{0.02 N_{0}} \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{N}\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{4\\sigma_{N}^{2}}\\right) dx\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the error function, $\\operatorname{erf}(z)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\operatorname{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{z} \\exp(-t^{2}) dt\n$$\nLet's perform a substitution in our integral. Let $t = \\frac{x}{2\\sigma_{N}}$. Then $x = 2\\sigma_{N}t$ and $dx = 2\\sigma_{N}dt$. The limits of integration for $t$ become:\nLower limit: $\\frac{-0.02 N_{0}}{2\\sigma_{N}} = -\\frac{0.01 N_{0}}{\\sigma_{N}}$\nUpper limit: $\\frac{0.02 N_{0}}{2\\sigma_{N}} = \\frac{0.01 N_{0}}{\\sigma_{N}}$\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$\nP = \\int_{-0.01 N_{0}/\\sigma_{N}}^{0.01 N_{0}/\\sigma_{N}} \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{N}\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp(-t^{2}) (2\\sigma_{N} dt) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{-0.01 N_{0}/\\sigma_{N}}^{0.01 N_{0}/\\sigma_{N}} \\exp(-t^{2}) dt\n$$\nSince $\\exp(-t^{2})$ is an even function, the integral from $-a$ to $a$ is twice the integral from $0$ to $a$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{0.01 N_{0}/\\sigma_{N}} \\exp(-t^{2}) dt\n$$\nBy the definition of the error function, this is:\n$$\nP = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{0.01 N_{0}}{\\sigma_{N}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires substituting the value $N_{0} = 1 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n$$\nP = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{0.01 \\times (1 \\times 10^{16})}{\\sigma_{N}}\\right) = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{1 \\times 10^{14}}{\\sigma_{N}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the probability. The argument of the error function is dimensionless, as $N_{0}$ and $\\sigma_{N}$ have the same units ($\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$).",
