            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the electrostatic scaling length, $\\lambda$, for a symmetric double-gate ultra-thin-body (UTB) MOSFET operating in the subthreshold regime. The derivation will be based on an energy balance principle, consistent with the provided approximations of volume inversion and negligible mobile charge, which allow the system's electrostatics to be analyzed using Laplace's equation. The final step is to compute the numerical value of $\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem is physically well-posed and internally consistent, providing a valid framework for analysis. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe scaling length $\\lambda$ characterizes the exponential decay of a potential perturbation along the channel, which we denote by $\\phi(x)$, where $x$ is the position along the channel. The key approximation is that for an ultra-thin silicon body, this potential perturbation is uniform in the direction perpendicular to the channel (the vertical direction). This is the essence of the \"volume inversion\" approximation in this context.\n\nWe can derive the governing equation for $\\phi(x)$ by considering the electrostatic energy stored in a differential segment of the channel. The total electrostatic energy is composed of two components:\n$1$. Energy stored in the lateral electric field within the silicon film.\n$2$. Energy stored in the vertical electric field, which corresponds to the energy stored in the gate capacitors.\n\nLet us define the energy per unit area of the channel.\nThe lateral electric field is $E_x = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$. The problem states to use the fundamental energy density expression $u = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon | \\mathbf{E} |^2$. Integrating this density over the silicon film thickness, $t_{\\mathrm{si}}$, gives the lateral energy stored per unit channel area, $u_{\\mathrm{lateral}}$:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{lateral}} = \\int_{-t_{\\mathrm{si}}/2}^{t_{\\mathrm{si}}/2} \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} E_x^2 dz = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{si}} \\left(-\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{si}} \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2$$\nHere, we have used the approximation that $\\phi$, and thus $E_x$, is constant over the vertical dimension $z$ inside the silicon film.\n\nThe energy stored in the gate capacitors per unit area is given by the formula $u_{gate} = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2$. Here, $V$ represents the potential across the capacitor, which is the channel potential perturbation $\\phi(x)$. The total capacitance per unit area from the two symmetric gates is given as $C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}}$. Therefore, the vertical energy stored per unit channel area, $u_{\\mathrm{vertical}}$, is:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{vertical}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}} \\phi^2$$\n\nThe total electrostatic energy $U$ per unit channel width is the integral of the sum of these energy densities along the channel length:\n$$U[\\phi] = \\int \\left( u_{\\mathrm{lateral}} + u_{\\mathrm{vertical}} \\right) dx = \\int \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} t_{\\mathrm{si}} \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}} \\phi^2 \\right] dx$$\n\nThe potential profile $\\phi(x)$ that physically manifests is the one that minimizes this total energy functional $U[\\phi]$.

Treating the two gates as electrostatically in parallel, the effective oxide capacitance per unit area is\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}} = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}.\n$$\nThe gate overdrive $V_{OV}$ partitions between the channel quasi-Fermi level shift and the voltage drop across the oxide, producing the relation\n$$\nV_{OV} = \\frac{E_F}{q} + \\frac{Q_i(E_F)}{C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}}}.\n$$\nThis equation must be solved self-consistently for $E_F$ given $V_{OV}$ and the dependence of $Q_i$ on $E_F$ via the subband occupancy $N_{s,n}(E_F)$. Note that $E_F$ and $E_n$ are handled in $\\mathrm{J}$ for numerical stability.\n\nFor transport, we adopt drift–diffusion with the relaxation-time approximation. The per-subband mobility is\n$$\n\\mu_n = \\frac{q \\tau_n}{m_t},\n$$\nwith a simple subband-dependent scattering time model provided as an input:\n$$\n\\tau_n = \\frac{\\tau_0}{1 + \\alpha (n-1)},\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_0$ is a baseline relaxation time and $\\alpha$ characterizes the increased scattering in higher subbands due to confinement and intersubband processes. The effective mobility under parallel conduction across subbands is the carrier-density-weighted average,\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^N N_{s,n} \\mu_n}{\\sum_{n=1}^N N_{s,n}}.\n$$\nTo quantify contributions, we compute the fractional contribution of each subband to $Q_i$,\n$$\nf_{Q,n} = \\frac{q N_{s,n}}{Q_i},\n$$\nand the fractional contribution of each subband to the conductivity weight (equivalently to the numerator of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$),\n$$\nf_{\\sigma,n} = \\frac{N_{s,n} \\mu_n}{\\sum_{m=1}^N N_{s,m} \\mu_m}.\n$$\nBy construction, $\\sum_{n=1}^N f_{Q,n} = 1$ and $\\sum_{n=1}^N f_{\\sigma,n} = 1$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n1. For given $T_{\\mathrm{si}}$, $m_z$, and $N$, compute $E_n$ for $n=1,\\dots,N$ via the infinite square well formula.\n2. Form $C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}} = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{t_{\\mathrm{ox}}}$.\n3. Define the function\n$$\nF(E_F) = \\frac{E_F}{q} + \\frac{Q_i(E_F)}{C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}}} - V_{OV},\n$$\nand solve $F(E_F)=0$ for $E_F$ numerically using a bracketing method. A robust bracket in energy space, e.g., from a sufficiently negative lower bound to a positive upper bound in $\\mathrm{J}$, ensures convergence because $Q_i(E_F)$ is monotonically increasing with $E_F$ and thus $F(E_F)$ is strictly increasing.\n4. With $E_F$ determined, compute $N_{s,n}$, $Q_i$, per-subband mobilities $\\mu_n$, the effective mobility $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and the fractional contributions $f_{Q,n}$ and $f_{\\sigma,n}$.\n5. Repeat for all provided test cases.\n\nNumerical and physical constants:\n- Use SI units throughout: thicknesses in $\\mathrm{m}$, energies in $\\mathrm{J}$, temperatures in $\\mathrm{K}$, charges in $\\mathrm{C}$, capacitance per unit area in $\\mathrm{F/m^2}$, mobilities in $\\mathrm{m^2/(V\\cdot s)}$.\n- Elementary charge $q$, Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$, reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$, vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$, and electron rest mass $m_0$ must be used with standard accepted values.\n\nTest suite coverage rationale:\n- Case A ($T_{\\mathrm{si}}=5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $t_{\\mathrm{ox}}=1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is a canonical UTB configuration with pronounced volume inversion and moderate quantum confinement.\n- Case B ($T_{\\mathrm{si}}=2.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) probes stronger confinement where higher subbands are significantly depopulated; this is a boundary condition for minimal volume inversion thickness.\n- Case C ($T_{\\mathrm{si}}=8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) tests thicker bodies where more subbands may contribute; it examines sensitivity to reduced confinement under still symmetric gating.\n- Case D ($t_{\\mathrm{ox}}=3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) examines the oxide-limited electrostatic partition, reducing $C_{\\mathrm{ox,eff}}$ and thereby increasing the fraction of $V_{OV}$ that raises $E_F$, impacting both $Q_i$ and the distribution across subbands.\n\nOutput formatting:\n- For each case, output a list $[Q_i,\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}},f_{Q,1},f_{Q,2},f_{Q,3},f_{Q,4},f_{\\sigma,1},f_{\\sigma,2},f_{\\sigma,3},f_{\\sigma,4}]$ with all elements rounded to six decimal places.\n- Aggregate the four case lists in a single top-level list and print it as one line.\n\nThis completes the principle-based derivation and algorithmic mapping required for implementation.",
