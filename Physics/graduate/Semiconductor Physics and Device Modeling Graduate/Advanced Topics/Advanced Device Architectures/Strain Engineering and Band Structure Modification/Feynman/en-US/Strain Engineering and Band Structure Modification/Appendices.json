Since we are taking a ratio, the constant prefactors will cancel, and the scattering rate is effectively proportional to the square root of the final kinetic energy:\n$$ \\Gamma \\propto \\sqrt{E_{f}} $$\nThe core task is to determine the final kinetic energy of the electron, $E_f$, in the target valley for both the unstrained and strained cases.\n\n**Case 1: Unstrained Crystal**\nIn the unstrained crystal, all $6$ valley minima are at the same energy level, which we can set as the reference energy, $E_{c} = 0$.\n- The initial total energy of the electron is $E_{total, i} = E_{c} + E_{i} = E_{i}$.\n- The electron scatters to another valley (with the same minimum energy $E_{c}$) by emitting a phonon of energy $\\hbar \\Omega_{iv}$.\n- By energy conservation, the final total energy is $E_{total, f} = E_{total, i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} = E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}$.\n- The final kinetic energy in the target valley, $E_{f, unstrained}$, is the final total energy minus the energy of the valley minimum:\n$$ E_{f, unstrained} = E_{total, f} - E_{c} = (E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}) - 0 = E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} $$\nFor this process to be possible, the final kinetic energy must be positive, i.e., $E_{i} > \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}$.\nThe scattering rate in the unstrained case, $\\Gamma_{unstrained}$, is proportional to the square root of this final kinetic energy:\n$$ \\Gamma_{unstrained} \\propto \\sqrt{E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}} $$\n\n**Case 2: Strained Crystal**\nUnder strain, the initial valley is a lowered $\\Delta_{z}$ valley with its minimum at $E_{c}^{(L)}$. The target valley is a raised $\\Delta_{x,y}$ valley with its minimum at $E_{c}^{(H)} = E_{c}^{(L)} + \\Delta E$.\n- The initial kinetic energy is $E_{i}$ relative to the minimum $E_{c}^{(L)}$. So, the initial total energy of the electron is $E_{total, i} = E_{c}^{(L)} + E_{i}$.\n- The electron scatters to the raised valley, emitting a phonon of energy $\\hbar \\Omega_{iv}$.\n- By energy conservation, the final total energy is $E_{total, f} = E_{total, i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} = E_{c}^{(L)} + E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}$.\n- The final total energy is also equal to the sum of the final valley's minimum energy and the electron's final kinetic energy, $E_{f, strained}$: $E_{total, f} = E_{c}^{(H)} + E_{f, strained}$.\n- Equating the expressions for $E_{total, f}$:\n$$ E_{c}^{(H)} + E_{f, strained} = E_{c}^{(L)} + E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} $$\n- Substituting $E_{c}^{(H)} = E_{c}^{(L)} + \\Delta E$:\n$$ (E_{c}^{(L)} + \\Delta E) + E_{f, strained} = E_{c}^{(L)} + E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} $$\n- Solving for the final kinetic energy in the strained case, $E_{f, strained}$:\n$$ E_{f, strained} = E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} - \\Delta E $$\nFor this process to occur, we must have $E_{i} > \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} + \\Delta E$.\nThe scattering rate in the strained case, $\\Gamma_{strained}$, is proportional to the square root of this final kinetic energy:\n$$ \\Gamma_{strained} \\propto \\sqrt{E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} - \\Delta E} $$\n\n**Ratio Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{\\Gamma_{strained}}{\\Gamma_{unstrained}}$. Using the proportionalities derived above:\n$$ \\frac{\\Gamma_{strained}}{\\Gamma_{unstrained}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} - \\Delta E}}{\\sqrt{E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} - \\Delta E}{E_{i} - \\hbar \\Omega_{iv}}} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n- $E_{i} = 100\\,\\text{meV}$\n- $\\hbar \\Omega_{iv} = 60\\,\\text{meV}$\n- $\\Delta E = 30\\,\\text{meV}$\n\nFirst, check the energy conservation conditions:\n- Unstrained threshold: $E_{i} = 100\\,\\text{meV} > \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} = 60\\,\\text{meV}$. The condition is met.\n- Strained threshold: $E_{i} = 100\\,\\text{meV} > \\hbar \\Omega_{iv} + \\Delta E = 60\\,\\text{meV} + 30\\,\\text{meV} = 90\\,\\text{meV}$. The condition is met.\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Gamma_{strained}}{\\Gamma_{unstrained}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100\\,\\text{meV} - 60\\,\\text{meV} - 30\\,\\text{meV}}{100\\,\\text{meV} - 60\\,\\text{meV}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10\\,\\text{meV}}{40\\,\\text{meV}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the ratio is $0.5000$. The information about effective masses $m_{l}$ and $m_{t}$ is not needed for the final numerical ratio as the density-of-states prefactor containing $m_d$ cancels out.",
