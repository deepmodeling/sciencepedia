Threshold Condition: The front-surface potential is fixed at $\\psi_{s} = \\psi_{T}$, where $\\psi_{T}$ is a constant independent of back-gate bias.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It describes a standard, albeit idealized, electrostatic model of an FD-SOI transistor. The assumptions are physically motivated simplifications commonly used in introductory device physics to derive first-order analytical models. The problem is self-contained, unambiguous, and seeks a derivable quantity based on fundamental principles of electrostatics.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem can be solved by considering the charge balance within the silicon film, which acts as a floating body electrostatically coupled to the front and back gates. Based on overall charge neutrality for the gate-insulator-semiconductor system, the sum of the charges on the external gate plates must be equal and opposite to the net charge within the silicon film.\n\nLet $V_{G}$ be the front-gate voltage and $V_{\\mathrm{BG}}$ be the back-gate voltage. According to the problem's assumption, the entire silicon film can be represented by a single potential node, $\\psi_{s}$. The voltage drop across the front-gate oxide is $V_{G} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},f} - \\psi_{s}$. The charge per unit area on the front-gate plate, $Q_f$, is given by the capacitor relation:\n$$Q_{f} = C_{f} (V_{G} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},f} - \\psi_{s})$$\n\nSimilarly, the voltage drop across the buried oxide (back-gate insulator) is $V_{\\mathrm{BG}} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},b} - \\psi_{s}$. The charge per unit area on the back-gate plate, $Q_b$, is:\n$$Q_{b} = C_{b} (V_{\\mathrm{BG}} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},b} - \\psi_{s})$$\n\nThe total charge per unit area within the silicon film, $Q_{\\mathrm{si}}$, consists of the depletion charge and the inversion charge. The problem states that the inversion charge is negligible at threshold. The depletion charge is due to ionized acceptor atoms, which are negatively charged. Therefore, the net charge in the silicon is $Q_{\\mathrm{si}} = -Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$, where $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}} = q N_{A} t_{\\mathrm{si}}$ is the magnitude of the depletion charge.\n\nFor charge neutrality of the entire device structure, the sum of charges on the gate plates and the charge in the silicon must be zero:\n$$Q_{f} + Q_{b} + Q_{\\mathrm{si}} = 0$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the charges, we obtain the general charge balance equation:\n$$C_{f} (V_{G} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},f} - \\psi_{s}) + C_{b} (V_{\\mathrm{BG}} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},b} - \\psi_{s}) - Q_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 0$$\n\nThis equation relates the gate voltages ($V_{G}$, $V_{\\mathrm{BG}}$) to the silicon potential $\\psi_{s}$. The problem specifies the threshold condition. At threshold, the front-gate voltage is defined as the threshold voltage, $V_{G} = V_{T}$, and the front-surface potential is fixed at a constant value, $\\psi_{s} = \\psi_{T}$. Substituting these conditions into the charge balance equation gives an implicit relationship between $V_{T}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{BG}}$:\n$$C_{f} (V_{T} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},f} - \\psi_{T}) + C_{b} (V_{\\mathrm{BG}} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},b} - \\psi_{T}) - Q_{\\mathrm{dep}} = 0$$\n\nWe are asked to find the sensitivity of the front-gate threshold voltage with respect to the back-gate voltage, which is the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial V_{T}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}}$. We can find this by differentiating the entire threshold equation with respect to $V_{\\mathrm{BG}}$. In this context, $V_{T}$ is a function of $V_{\\mathrm{BG}}$. All other parameters, namely $C_{f}$, $C_{b}$, $V_{\\mathrm{FB},f}$, $V_{\\mathrm{FB},b}$, $\\psi_{T}$, and $Q_{\\mathrm{dep}}$, are constants as per the problem statement.\n\nApplying the differentiation operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}}$ to the equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} \\left[ C_{f} (V_{T} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},f} - \\psi_{T}) + C_{b} (V_{\\mathrm{BG}} - V_{\\mathrm{FB},b} - \\psi_{T}) - Q_{\\mathrm{dep}} \\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} [0]$$\n\nDifferentiating term-by-term:\n$$C_{f} \\frac{\\partial V_{T}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} - 0 - 0 + C_{b} \\frac{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} - 0 - 0 - 0 = 0$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$C_{f} \\frac{\\partial V_{T}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} + C_{b} = 0$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the desired derivative $\\frac{\\partial V_{T}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}}$:\n$$C_{f} \\frac{\\partial V_{T}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} = -C_{b}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{T}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{BG}}} = -\\frac{C_{b}}{C_{f}}$$\n\nThis result shows that the sensitivity of the front-gate threshold voltage to the back-gate voltage is given by the negative ratio of the back-gate capacitance to the front-gate capacitance. This is a fundamental characteristic of double-gated or FD-SOI devices, representing the capacitive voltage division between the two gates that controls the potential of the silicon channel.",

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\nThe dynamic behavior of the body potential, $V_{B}(t)$, is governed by charge conservation at the floating body node. We apply Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), which states that the algebraic sum of currents entering the node must be zero. The currents involved are:\n1. The impact ionization current, $I_{\\mathrm{II}}(t)$, which injects charge (holes) into the body.\n2. The recombination current, $I_{\\mathrm{recomb}}(V_{B})$, which removes charge from the body.\n3. The displacement current due to the body capacitance, $I_{C}(t) = C_{B} \\frac{dV_{B}(t)}{dt}$, which accounts for the change in stored charge on the capacitor as the body potential changes.\n\nAccording to KCL, the sum of currents leaving the node equals the sum of currents entering the node:\n$$I_{C}(t) + I_{\\mathrm{recomb}}(V_{B}) = I_{\\mathrm{II}}(t)$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the currents:\n$$C_{B} \\frac{dV_{B}(t)}{dt} + G_{B}\\,V_{B}(t) = I_{0}\\,u(t)$$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the unit-step function $u(t) = 1$, so the equation simplifies to:\n$$C_{B} \\frac{dV_{B}(t)}{dt} + G_{B}\\,V_{B}(t) = I_{0}$$\nThis is the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To put it in standard form, we divide by $C_{B}$:\n$$\\frac{dV_{B}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{G_{B}}{C_{B}}V_{B}(t) = \\frac{I_{0}}{C_{B}}$$\n\n**Solution of the Differential Equation**\nThis equation describes a system with a characteristic time constant $\\tau = \\frac{C_{B}}{G_{B}}$. The general solution is the sum of a transient (homogeneous) part and a steady-state (particular) part.\nThe general solution for a first-order system with a step input is of the form:\n$$V_{B}(t) = V_{B,\\text{ss}} + (V_{B}(0^{+}) - V_{B,\\text{ss}}) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nwhere $V_{B,\\text{ss}}$ is the steady-state potential as $t \\to \\infty$ and $V_{B}(0^{+})$ is the initial potential at $t = 0^{+}$.\n\nThe potential across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so the initial condition at $t=0^{+}$ is the same as at $t=0^{-}$.\n$$V_{B}(0^{+}) = V_{B}(0^{-}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe steady-state potential is found by setting the time derivative to zero in the differential equation, as the potential no longer changes:\n$$G_{B}\\,V_{B,\\text{ss}} = I_{0} \\implies V_{B,\\text{ss}} = \\frac{I_{0}}{G_{B}}$$\nSubstituting $V_{B}(0^{+})$, $V_{B,\\text{ss}}$, and $\\tau$ into the general solution:\n$$V_{B}(t) = \\frac{I_{0}}{G_{B}} + \\left(0 - \\frac{I_{0}}{G_{B}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{C_{B}/G_{B}}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression for the body potential for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$V_{B}(t) = \\frac{I_{0}}{G_{B}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{B}}{C_{B}}t\\right)\\right)$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are asked to evaluate $V_B(t)$ at $t = 25\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ using the given parameter values.\n- $C_{B} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- $G_{B} = 120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n- $I_{0} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $t = 25 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the steady-state voltage, $V_{B,\\text{ss}}$, and the time constant, $\\tau$.\n$$V_{B,\\text{ss}} = \\frac{I_{0}}{G_{B}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{10}{120}\\,\\mathrm{V} = \\frac{1}{12}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{C_{B}}{G_{B}} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}}{120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}} = 0.01 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\nNow, we substitute these values and the time $t$ into the solution for $V_{B}(t)$:\n$$V_{B}(25\\,\\mathrm{ns}) = \\frac{1}{12} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{ns}}{10\\,\\mathrm{ns}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$V_{B}(25\\,\\mathrm{ns}) = \\frac{1}{12} (1 - \\exp(-2.5))$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-2.5) \\approx 0.0820849986$$\n$$V_{B}(25\\,\\mathrm{ns}) \\approx \\frac{1}{12} (1 - 0.0820849986) = \\frac{1}{12} (0.9179150014)$$\n$$V_{B}(25\\,\\mathrm{ns}) \\approx 0.07649291678\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$V_{B}(25\\,\\mathrm{ns}) \\approx 0.07649\\,\\mathrm{V}$$",

Fourier's law of heat conduction in one dimension ($z$) states that the heat flux $q_z$ is proportional to the temperature gradient:\n$$q_z = -k \\frac{dT}{dz}$$\nHere, $q_z$ is the heat flux (power per unit area), $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and $T$ is the temperature. We are given a uniform areal power density $q''$ generated in the channel, which must conduct through the BOX to the substrate. Let the heat flow be in the positive $z$-direction, from the channel at $z=0$ to the substrate interface at $z=t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$. The heat flux is therefore constant and equal to $q''$, but it flows from high temperature to low temperature. Let the channel temperature be $T$ and the substrate temperature be the ambient reference $T_0$. The heat flows from $T$ to $T_0$. To align with the direction of heat flow, let's set the coordinate system with $z=0$ at the channel and $z=t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$ at the substrate. The heat flux in the $+z$ direction is $q_z = q''$.\n\nFourier's Law is $q'' = -k_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{dT}{dz}$. We can separate variables and integrate.\n$$q'' dz = -k_{\\mathrm{ox}} dT$$\nWe integrate from the channel ($z=0$, $T=T$) to the substrate ($z=t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}$, $T=T_0$):\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} q'' dz = \\int_{T}^{T_0} -k_{\\mathrm{ox}} dT$$\nSince $q''$ and $k_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ are constant:\n$$q'' [z]_0^{t_{\\mathrm{BOX}}} = -k_{\\mathrm{ox}} [T]_T^{T_0}$$\n$$q'' (t_{\\mathrm{BOX}} - 0) = -k_{\\mathrm{ox}} (T_0 - T)$$\n$$q'' t_{\\mathrm{BOX}} = k_{\\mathrm{ox}} (T - T_0)$$\nThe steady-state temperature rise of the channel is defined as $\\Delta T = T - T_0$.

Substituting these into the equation yields the desired expression for the temperature-dependent saturation current:\n$$I_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}(T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu(T) C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(T))^2$$\n\n### Task 3: Computation of the Ratio $R$\n\nThe task is to compute the ratio $R = I_{D,\\mathrm{sat,PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}}) \\big/ I_{D,\\mathrm{sat,FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}})$, where $T_{\\mathrm{PD}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{FD}}$ are the final steady-state temperatures of the PD-SOI and FD-SOI devices, respectively.\n\nUsing the expression for $I_{D,\\mathrm{sat}}(T)$, the ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{\\mathrm{PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}}) C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{ov,PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}}))^2}{\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{\\mathrm{FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}}) C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{ov,FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}}))^2}$$\nThe common prefactor $\\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L}$ cancels out.\n$$R = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}})}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}})} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ov,PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}})}{V_{\\mathrm{ov,FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}})} \\right)^2$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the temperature rise for each device using the result from Task 1.\nThe given parameters are $q'' = 1.0 \\times 10^7 \\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 1.4 \\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nFor the PD-SOI device: $t_{\\mathrm{BOX,PD}} = 150 \\,\\mathrm{nm} = 150 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{PD}} = \\frac{q'' t_{\\mathrm{BOX,PD}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^7 \\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) (150 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.4 \\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.5}{1.4} = \\frac{15}{14} \\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe final temperature is $T_{\\mathrm{PD}} = T_0 + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{PD}} = 300 + \\frac{15}{14} = \\frac{4215}{14} \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFor the FD-SOI device: $t_{\\mathrm{BOX,FD}} = 25 \\,\\mathrm{nm} = 25 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\frac{q'' t_{\\mathrm{BOX,FD}}}{k_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^7 \\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) (25 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.4 \\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = \\frac{0.25}{1.4} = \\frac{2.5}{14} = \\frac{5}{28} \\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe final temperature is $T_{\\mathrm{FD}} = T_0 + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{FD}} = 300 + \\frac{5}{28} = \\frac{8405}{28} \\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the temperature-dependent parameters, $\\mu(T)$ and $V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(T)$, for each device.\nThe mobility is given by $\\mu(T) = \\mu_0 (T/T_0)^{-m}$ with $m = 1.6$. The ratio of mobilities is:\n$$\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}})}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 (T_{\\mathrm{PD}}/T_0)^{-m}}{\\mu_0 (T_{\\mathrm{FD}}/T_0)^{-m}} = \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{PD}}}{T_{\\mathrm{FD}}} \\right)^{-m} = \\left( \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{T_{\\mathrm{PD}}} \\right)^{m}$$\n$$\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{T_{\\mathrm{PD}}} = \\frac{8405/28}{4215/14} = \\frac{8405}{28} \\cdot \\frac{14}{4215} = \\frac{8405}{2 \\cdot 4215} = \\frac{8405}{8430}$$\nSo, the mobility ratio is $\\left( \\frac{8405}{8430} \\right)^{1.6}$.\n\nThe threshold voltage is $V_T(T) = V_{T0} - \\alpha(T - T_0)$ with $\\alpha = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{V\\,K^{-1}}$.\nThe overdrive voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(T) = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_T(T) = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - (V_{T0} - \\alpha \\Delta T) = (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{T0}) + \\alpha \\Delta T$.\n\nFor the PD-SOI device: $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.80 \\,\\mathrm{V}$, $V_{T0,\\mathrm{PD}} = 0.35 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ov,PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}}) = (0.80 - 0.35) + (1.8 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{15}{14}\\right) = 0.45 + \\frac{0.027}{14} = \\frac{6.3 + 0.027}{14} = \\frac{6.327}{14} \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nFor the FD-SOI device: $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.80 \\,\\mathrm{V}$, $V_{T0,\\mathrm{FD}} = 0.25 \\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{ov,FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}}) = (0.80 - 0.25) + (1.8 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{5}{28}\\right) = 0.55 + \\frac{0.009}{28} = \\frac{15.4 + 0.009}{28} = \\frac{15.409}{28} \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNow we compute the ratio of the squared overdrive voltages:\n$$\\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ov,PD}}(T_{\\mathrm{PD}})}{V_{\\mathrm{ov,FD}}(T_{\\mathrm{FD}})} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{6.327/14}{15.409/28} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{6.327}{14} \\cdot \\frac{28}{15.409} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot 6.327}{15.409} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{12.654}{15.409} \\right)^2$$\n\nFinally, we combine the mobility and overdrive ratios to find $R$:\n$$R = \\left( \\frac{8405}{8430} \\right)^{1.6} \\times \\left( \\frac{12.654}{15.409} \\right)^2$$\nCalculating the numerical values for the terms:\n$$\\left( \\frac{8405}{8430} \\right)^{1.6} \\approx (0.9970344)^{1.6} \\approx 0.995267$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{12.654}{15.409} \\right)^2 \\approx (0.8212084)^2 \\approx 0.674383$$\n$$R \\approx 0.995267 \\times 0.674383 \\approx 0.671194$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 0.6712$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless, as required.",
