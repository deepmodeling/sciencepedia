            "solution": "We begin by applying the one-dimensional steady-state continuity equation for excess minority carriers (electrons) in the $p$-type base. Let the position coordinate $x$ range from $x=0$ at the emitter-base junction edge to $x=W_B$ at the collector-base junction edge. The excess electron concentration is denoted by $\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$. The continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\delta n_p(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p(x)}{L_n^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$ is the electron diffusion length. The problem specifies that we assume negligible recombination, which is equivalent to the short-base limit $W_B \\ll L_n$. In this limit, the recombination term $\\delta n_p(x)/L_n^2$ is negligible compared to the diffusion term. The continuity equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\delta n_p(x)}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear function: $\\delta n_p(x) = C_1 x + C_2$.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions.\n1. At the emitter-base junction ($x=0$), which is forward-biased with voltage $V_{BE}$, the law of the junction under low-level injection gives:\n$$ \\delta n_p(0) = n_{p0} (\\exp(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_B T}) - 1) = n_{p0} (\\exp(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}) - 1) $$\n2. At the collector-base junction ($x=W_B$), which is strongly reverse-biased, the excess carrier concentration is effectively zero:\n$$ \\delta n_p(W_B) = 0 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition to the general solution:\n$$ C_1 W_B + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -C_1 W_B $$\nSo, $\\delta n_p(x) = C_1(x - W_B)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$ \\delta n_p(0) = C_1(0 - W_B) = -C_1 W_B \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{W_B} $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back, we find the linear excess electron profile in the base:\n$$ \\delta n_p(x) = \\delta n_p(0) \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{W_B} \\right) $$\nThe collector current $I_C$ is driven by the diffusion of these electrons. Since recombination is neglected, the electron current density is constant across the base.

To express $Q_F$ in terms of $I_C$, we rearrange the $I_C$ equation: $A_E q \\delta n_p(0) = \\frac{I_C W_B}{D_n}$. Substituting this into the expression for $Q_F$:\n$$ Q_F = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{I_C W_B}{D_n} \\right) W_B = \\frac{I_C W_B^2}{2 D_n} $$\nThis completes the first task. Now, we derive the diffusion capacitance $C_{\\pi} = dQ_F/dV_{BE}$. For forward-active operation, $V_{BE} \\gg V_T$, so $I_C \\propto \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$. We can write $I_C(V_{BE}) = I_S \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$, where $I_S$ is a saturation current that depends on device geometry and doping.\nUsing the chain rule:\n$$ C_{\\pi} = \\frac{dQ_F}{dV_{BE}} = \\frac{dQ_F}{dI_C} \\frac{dI_C}{dV_{BE}} $$\nFrom our expression for $Q_F$, the first derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dQ_F}{dI_C} = \\frac{d}{dI_C} \\left( \\frac{I_C W_B^2}{2 D_n} \\right) = \\frac{W_B^2}{2 D_n} $$\nThe second derivative, the transconductance $g_m$, is:\n$$ \\frac{dI_C}{dV_{BE}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{BE}} \\left( I_S \\exp(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}) \\right) = I_S \\exp(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}) \\cdot \\frac{1}{V_T} = \\frac{I_C}{V_T} $$\nCombining these results gives the expression for $C_{\\pi}$:\n$$ C_{\\pi} = \\left( \\frac{W_B^2}{2 D_n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{I_C}{V_T} \\right) $$\nNow we can compute the numerical value.

Rounded to four significant figures, $C_{\\pi} = 0.2418\\,\\mathrm{pF}$.\n\nFor the second part of the task, we independently identify the expressions for $g_m$ and $\\tau_F$ from our derivation.\nThe transconductance $g_m$ was already derived as part of the $C_{\\pi}$ calculation:\n$$ g_m = \\frac{dI_C}{dV_{BE}} = \\frac{I_C}{V_T} $$\nThe forward transit time, $\\tau_F$, is the average time for a minority carrier to diffuse across the base. For the simplified model where $Q_F$ is linearly proportional to $I_C$, it is defined as the ratio of the stored charge to the current:\n$$ \\tau_F = \\frac{Q_F}{I_C} $$\nUsing our expression for $Q_F$:\n$$ \\tau_F = \\frac{I_C W_B^2 / (2 D_n)}{I_C} = \\frac{W_B^2}{2 D_n} $$\nNow we check the product $g_m \\tau_F$:\n$$ g_m \\tau_F = \\left( \\frac{I_C}{V_T} \\right) \\left( \\frac{W_B^2}{2 D_n} \\right) $$\nThis expression is identical to the one we derived for $C_{\\pi}$. Therefore, within the assumptions of this idealized model (linear profile, negligible recombination), the relation $C_{\\pi} = g_m \\tau_F$ is an exact identity.\nThe absolute fractional deviation is:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{|C_{\\pi} - g_m \\tau_F|}{C_{\\pi}} = \\frac{|C_{\\pi} - C_{\\pi}|}{C_{\\pi}} = 0 $$\nThe condition $\\Delta \\le 0.01$ is satisfied, as $0 \\le 0.01$. This confirms the consistency of the derived quantities within the specified physical model. The final required answer is the numerical value of $C_{\\pi}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the collector space-charge transit time, $\\tau_{C}$, for electrons in an $n$-$p$-$n$ Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). The process involves two main steps: first, deriving a theoretical expression for $\\tau_{C}$, and second, substituting the given numerical values to find its value.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Collector Transit Time, $\\tau_{C}$**\n\nThe collector transit time, $\\tau_{C}$, represents the time an electron takes to travel across the base-collector (BC) space-charge region (SCR), which has a width of $W_{SC}$. This time can be defined by integrating the reciprocal of the electron's velocity, $v(x)$, over the path length:\n$$ \\tau_C = \\int_0^{W_{SC}} \\frac{dx}{v(x)} $$\nThe coordinate system is set up with the metallurgical junction at $x=0$ and the SCR extending into the lightly doped collector from $x=0$ to $x=W_{SC}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that electron transport is drift-dominated and velocity saturation is neglected. Therefore, the electron velocity is proportional to the local electric field magnitude, $|\\mathcal{E}(x)|$:\n$$ v(x) = \\mu_n |\\mathcal{E}(x)| $$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ is the constant electron mobility.

In this model, the electric field $|\\mathcal{E}(x)|$ decreases linearly to zero at the edge of the depletion region, $x=W_{SC}$. Consequently, the velocity $v(W_{SC})$ becomes zero, causing the integrand to diverge at $x=W_{SC}$ and yielding an infinite transit time. This divergence is a known artifact of the simplified depletion approximation. To obtain a finite, physically meaningful estimate, an effective transit time is calculated using the average carrier velocity, $\\bar{v}$:\n$$ \\tau_C = \\frac{W_{SC}}{\\bar{v}} $$\nThe average velocity $\\bar{v}$ is the spatial average of the velocity profile $v(x)$ over the width of the SCR:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{W_{SC}} \\int_0^{W_{SC}} v(x) dx = \\frac{1}{W_{SC}} \\int_0^{W_{SC}} \\mu_n |\\mathcal{E}(x)| dx $$\nSince $\\mu_n$ is constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{\\mu_n}{W_{SC}} \\int_0^{W_{SC}} |\\mathcal{E}(x)| dx $$\nThe integral of the electric field magnitude across a region is, by definition, the total electrostatic potential drop over that region, which we denote as $V_{total}$.\n$$ V_{total} = \\int_0^{W_{SC}} |\\mathcalE(x)| dx $$\nFor a reverse-biased $p$-$n$ junction, this total potential drop is the sum of the built-in potential, $V_{bi}$, and the applied reverse-bias voltage, $V_{CB}$.\n$$ V_{total} = V_{bi} + V_{CB} $$\nBy substituting the definition of $V_{total}$ into the expression for the average velocity, we find:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{\\mu_n V_{total}}{W_{SC}} $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\bar{v}$ back into our equation for $\\tau_C$:\n$$ \\tau_C = \\frac{W_{SC}}{\\bar{v}} = \\frac{W_{SC}}{(\\mu_n V_{total} / W_{SC})} = \\frac{W_{SC}^2}{\\mu_n V_{total}} $$\nThis is the desired expression for the collector transit time in terms of the SCR width $W_{SC}$, the electron mobility $\\mu_n$, and the total potential drop $V_{total}$.\n\n**2.

Minority-carrier transport across the base is diffusion-dominated, with electron diffusion coefficient $D_{n}$ that is set by the Einstein relation and is independent of $W_{B}$ under the stated operating conditions. Recombination in the neutral base during transit is negligible because the minority-carrier lifetime is much longer than the characteristic transport time, and the emitter injection establishes a boundary condition of minority-electron concentration $n(0)=n_{E}$ at the emitter-base edge ($x=0$), with the collector-base depletion region acting as an absorbing boundary $n(W_{B})=0$ at $x=W_{B}$. The base resistance $R_{B}$ is the ohmic spreading resistance from the external base contact to the active emitter edge, modeled as lateral current flow through a rectangular slab of base material of length $L_{\\text{lat}}$, width $W_{\\text{lat}}$, and thickness equal to the neutral base width $W_{B}$.

Base Transit Time ($\\tau_{B}$)**\n\nThe transport of minority carriers (electrons) in the neutral p-type base is governed by the steady-state continuity equation. As stated, the internal electric field is negligible (diffusion-dominated transport) and recombination is negligible. The one-dimensional continuity equation for the excess minority-electron concentration $n'(x)$ simplifies to:\n$$ D_{n} \\frac{d^2 n'(x)}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion coefficient. The boundary conditions are given as an injected concentration $n(0) = n_{E}$ at the emitter-base junction edge ($x=0$) and $n(W_{B}) = 0$ at the collector-base junction edge ($x=W_{B}$). Assuming low-level injection, the excess concentration $n'(x)$ is approximately equal to the total concentration $n(x)$ as the equilibrium concentration $n_{p0}$ is very small. Thus, we solve for $n(x)$ with boundary conditions $n(0) = n_{E}$ and $n(W_{B}) = 0$.\n\nThe general solution to the differential equation is a linear function:\n$$ n(x) = Ax + B $$\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=W_{B}$:\n$$ n(W_{B}) = A W_{B} + B = 0 \\implies B = -A W_{B} $$\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ n(0) = A(0) + B = n_{E} \\implies B = n_{E} $$\nCombining these results, we find $A = -n_{E}/W_{B}$. The minority-carrier concentration profile in the base is therefore:\n$$ n(x) = n_{E} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{W_{B}} \\right) $$\nThe total excess minority charge, $Q_{B}$, stored in the neutral base is the integral of the charge density $q n(x)$ over the volume of the base, which has an emitter area $A_{E}$ and neutral width $W_{B}$:\n$$ Q_{B} = \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} q A_{E} n(x) dx = q A_{E} \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} n_{E} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x}{W_{B}} \\right) dx $$\n$$ Q_{B} = q A_{E} n_{E} \\left[ x - \\frac{x^2}{2W_{B}} \\right]_{0}^{W_{B}} = q A_{E} n_{E} \\left( W_{B} - \\frac{W_{B}^2}{2W_{B}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} q A_{E} n_{E} W_{B} $$\nThe collector current, $I_{C}$, is driven by the diffusion of electrons at the collector edge of the neutral base ($x=W_{B}$).

The resistance $R$ of a conductor with resistivity $\\rho$, length $L$, and cross-sectional area $A$ is $R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$.\nFor the lateral base resistance, the current flows along the length $L_{\\text{lat}}$. The cross-sectional area through which this current flows is the product of the lateral width $W_{\\text{lat}}$ and the thickness, which is the neutral base width $W_{B}$. So, $A = W_{\\text{lat}} W_{B}$. The base resistivity $\\rho_{B}$ is given as $\\rho_{B} = 1/(q \\mu_{p} N_{A})$.\nSubstituting these into the resistance formula, we get:\n$$ R_{B} = \\rho_{B} \\frac{L_{\\text{lat}}}{W_{\\text{lat}} W_{B}} = \\frac{1}{q \\mu_{p} N_{A}} \\frac{L_{\\text{lat}}}{W_{\\text{lat}} W_{B}} $$\nThe problem states that $q$, $\\mu_{p}$, $N_{A}$, $L_{\\text{lat}}$, and $W_{\\text{lat}}$ are constants. Therefore, the scaling of the base resistance with the neutral base width is:\n$$ R_{B} \\propto \\frac{1}{W_{B}} \\propto W_{B}^{-1} $$\n\n**3. Unity-Gain Cutoff Frequency ($f_{T}$)**\n\nThe unity-gain cutoff frequency $f_{T}$ is fundamentally related to the total forward transit time $\\tau_{F}$ of the device by the relation $f_{T} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\tau_{F}}$. The problem provides simplifying assumptions that the emitter and collector delay contributions are negligible, and depletion-layer capacitance effects are also negligible compared to the diffusion charge. Under these assumptions, the total forward transit time is dominated by the base transit time:\n$$ \\tau_{F} \\approx \\tau_{B} $$\nThus, the cutoff frequency can be expressed as:\n$$ f_{T} \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\tau_{B}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{2 D_{n}}{W_{B}^2} = \\frac{D_{n}}{\\pi W_{B}^2} $$\nSince $D_{n}$ and $\\pi$ are constants, the scaling of the cutoff frequency with the neutral base width is:\n$$ f_{T} \\propto \\frac{1}{W_{B}^2} \\propto W_{B}^{-2} $$\n\n**4. Calculation of Ratios**\n\nWe are given a design change where the neutral base width $W_{B}$ is reduced to $W_{B}' = W_{B}/2$. We now compute the ratios of the new (primed) values to the old (unprimed) values.\n\nFor the base transit time $\\tau_{B}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{B}'}{\\tau_{B}} = \\frac{(W_{B}')^2 / (2 D_{n})}{W_{B}^2 / (2 D_{n})} = \\left(\\frac{W_{B}'}{W_{B}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{W_{B}/2}{W_{B}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\nFor the base resistance $R_{B}$:\n$$ \\frac{R_{B}'}{R_{B}} = \\frac{C / W_{B}'}{C / W_{B}} = \\frac{W_{B}}{W_{B}'} = \\frac{W_{B}}{W_{B}/2} = 2 $$\nwhere $C = \\frac{L_{\\text{lat}}}{q \\mu_{p} N_{A} W_{\\text{lat}}}$ is the collection of constants.\n\nFor the cutoff frequency $f_{T}$:\n$$ \\frac{f_{T}'}{f_{T}} = \\frac{D_{n} / (\\pi (W_{B}')^2)}{D_{n} / (\\pi W_{B}^2)} = \\left(\\frac{W_{B}}{W_{B}'}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{W_{B}}{W_{B}/2}\\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4 $$\n\nThe three requested dimensionless ratios are $\\tau_{B}'/\\tau_{B} = 1/4$, $R_{B}'/R_{B} = 2$, and $f_{T}'/f_{T} = 4$.",
