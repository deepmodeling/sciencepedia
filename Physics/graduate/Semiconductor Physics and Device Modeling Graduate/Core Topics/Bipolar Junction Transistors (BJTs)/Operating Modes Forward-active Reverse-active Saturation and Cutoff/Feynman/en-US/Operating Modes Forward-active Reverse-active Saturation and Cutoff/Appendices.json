The operating modes (forward-active, saturation) are central concepts in BJT theory. The provided data values are realistic for a silicon BJT operating at room temperature. The problem is fundamentally sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient data to uniquely determine the requested parameters, $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}$ and $V_A$, within the framework of the standard simplified BJT models. The question is structured to guide the derivation from first principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Self-Contained and Consistent:** The problem contains all necessary data. A verification check (not shown here, but performed internally) confirms that the two datasets are mutually consistent with the underlying physical model, reinforcing the problem's validity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution follows.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of two parameters: the saturation boundary voltage, $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}$, and the Early voltage, $V_A$.\n\n**1. Saturation Boundary Voltage ($V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}$)**\n\nThe operating modes of a BJT are defined by the bias state (forward or reverse) of its two junctions: the base-emitter (BE) junction and the collector-base (CB) junction.\n- **Forward-Active Mode:** The BE junction is forward-biased ($V_{BE}  0$), and the CB junction is reverse-biased ($V_{BC}  0$).\n- **Saturation Mode:** The BE junction is forward-biased ($V_{BE}  0$), and the CB junction is also forward-biased ($V_{BC}  0$).\n\nThe transition, or boundary, between the forward-active region and the saturation region occurs at the point where the CB junction bias transitions from reverse to forward. The simplest and most direct definition of this boundary is the condition where the collector-base voltage is zero.\n$$V_{BC} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe voltages across the transistor terminals are related by Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):\n$$V_{CE} = V_{CB} + V_{BE}$$\nBy rearranging this equation, we can express $V_{CB}$ in terms of $V_{CE}$ and $V_{BE}$:\n$$V_{CB} = V_{CE} - V_{BE}$$\nThe saturation boundary voltage, $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}$, is the value of $V_{CE}$ at which the transistor enters saturation. Applying the boundary condition $V_{BC} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to the KVL equation yields:\n$$0 = V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} - V_{BE}$$\nThis gives a direct relationship for the saturation boundary voltage:\n$$V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} = V_{BE}$$\nThe problem asks for $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}}$ at the \"given drive level\". This drive level is specified in the second set of measurements (the output characteristics), which were performed at a constant base-emitter voltage:\n$$V_{BE} = 0.700\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nTherefore, the saturation boundary voltage at this drive level is:\n$$V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.700\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**2. Early Voltage ($V_A$)**\n\nThe Early effect, or base-width modulation, describes the increase in collector current $I_C$ with increasing collector-emitter voltage $V_{CE}$ in the forward-active region. This effect arises because an increase in $V_{CE}$ leads to an increase in the reverse bias across the CB junction ($V_{CB} = V_{CE} - V_{BE}$). This wider depletion region reduces the effective neutral base width, which in turn increases the collector diffusion current (as $I_C$ is inversely proportional to the base width).\n\nThe problem states that this dependence can be linearized. The standard model for the collector current that includes the Early effect is:\n$$I_C = I_{S} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{n V_T}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\\right)$$\nFor a fixed base-emitter voltage $V_{BE}$, the term $I_S \\exp(V_{BE}/(nV_T))$ is constant. Let's call this constant $I_{C0}$, which represents the collector current extrapolated to $V_{CE}=0$. The equation becomes:\n$$I_C(V_{CE}) = I_{C0} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE}}{V_A}\\right)$$\nThis is the equation of a straight line in the $I_C$-$V_{CE}$ plane. If we extrapolate this line, it will intersect the $V_{CE}$-axis (where $I_C = 0$) at $V_{CE} = -V_A$.\n$$0 = I_{C0} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_{CE,\\text{intercept}}}{V_A}\\right) \\implies V_{CE,\\text{intercept}} = -V_A$$\nWe can determine $V_A$ by finding this intercept using the two data points from the output characteristics measurement, which were taken at a constant $V_{BE}=0.700\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThe data points are $(V_{CE,a}, I_{C,a}) = (2.0\\,\\mathrm{V}, 2.17\\,\\mathrm{mA})$ and $(V_{CE,b}, I_{C,b}) = (6.0\\,\\mathrm{V}, 2.59\\,\\mathrm{mA})$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope, $m$, of the $I_C$-$V_{CE}$ characteristic:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta I_C}{\\Delta V_{CE}} = \\frac{I_{C,b} - I_{C,a}}{V_{CE,b} - V_{CE,a}} = \\frac{(2.59 - 2.17)\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{(6.0 - 2.0)\\,\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.42\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{4.0\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 0.105\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}$$\nNow, using the point-slope form of a linear equation, $I_C - I_{C,a} = m(V_{CE} - V_{CE,a})$, we can find the $V_{CE}$-intercept by setting $I_C = 0$:\n$$0 - I_{C,a} = m(V_{CE,\\text{intercept}} - V_{CE,a})$$\nSolving for $V_{CE,\\text{intercept}}$:\n$$-I_{C,a} = m \\cdot V_{CE,\\text{intercept}} - m \\cdot V_{CE,a}$$\n$$V_{CE,\\text{intercept}} = V_{CE,a} - \\frac{I_{C,a}}{m}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$V_{CE,\\text{intercept}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - \\frac{2.17\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{0.105\\,\\mathrm{mA/V}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - 20.666... \\,\\mathrm{V} = -18.666... \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe Early voltage $V_A$ is the negative of this intercept:\n$$V_A = -V_{CE,\\text{intercept}} = -(-18.666... \\,\\mathrm{V}) = 18.666... \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**Final Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\n1.  $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.700\\,\\mathrm{V}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.7000\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n2.  $V_A = 18.666... \\,\\mathrm{V}$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $V_A = 18.67\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe final answers are $V_{CE,\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.7000\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_A = 18.67\\,\\mathrm{V}$.",

This condition is defined as the onset of saturation, which is the boundary of the forward-active region. In the forward-active region, the collector current $I_C$ is related to the base current $I_B$ by the forward current gain $\\beta_F$. The base current at the edge of saturation, denoted as $I_{B,sat}$, is therefore given by:\n$$I_{B,sat} = \\frac{I_C}{\\beta_F}$$\nThis is the component of the base current that supports the collector current flow.\n\nThe problem states that the base drive is increased by an overdrive factor $m$, such that the actual base current, $I_B$, is:\n$$I_B = m \\cdot I_{B,sat}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{B,sat}$:\n$$I_B = m \\frac{I_C}{\\beta_F}$$\n\nWhen the base current $I_B$ exceeds $I_{B,sat}$, the transistor is driven into saturation. The portion of the base current greater than $I_{B,sat}$ is the excess base current, or overdrive current, denoted as $I_{BS}$. This current does not contribute to the collector current (which is fixed at $I_C$ in this application) but instead supplies the charge for recombination processes associated with saturation.\n$$I_{BS} = I_B - I_{B,sat}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_B$ and $I_{B,sat}$:\n$$I_{BS} = m \\cdot I_{B,sat} - I_{B,sat} = (m - 1)I_{B,sat}$$\n$$I_{BS} = (m-1) \\frac{I_C}{\\beta_F}$$\n\nThe problem defines that this excess base current, $I_{BS}$, sustains an \"extra stored charge\" due to saturation, which we denote as $Q_S$. This charge has an associated \"effective recombination lifetime\" $\\tau_S$. The relationship between the current and the charge it sustains is given by the fundamental charge-control equation:\n$$I_{BS} = \\frac{Q_S}{\\tau_S}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"incremental stored charge penalty,\" which is precisely this extra stored charge $Q_S$. We can solve for $Q_S$:\n$$Q_S = I_{BS} \\cdot \\tau_S$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{BS}$:\n$$Q_S = (m-1) \\frac{I_C}{\\beta_F} \\tau_S$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $I_C = 50\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- $\\beta_F = 100$\n- $\\tau_S = 300\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $m = 3$\n\n$$Q_S = (3 - 1) \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{100} (300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$Q_S = 2 \\cdot \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-3}}{100} \\cdot (300 \\times 10^{-9})\\,\\mathrm{C}$$\n$$Q_S = 2 \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (300 \\times 10^{-9})\\,\\mathrm{C}$$\n$$Q_S = (1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (300 \\times 10^{-9})\\,\\mathrm{C}$$\n$$Q_S = 300 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C}$$\n\nTo express this result in nanocoulombs ($\\mathrm{nC}$), we use the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{nC} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}$:\n$$Q_S = 0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$Q_S = 0.300\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\nThe forward transit time $\\tau_F = 100\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ was not needed to calculate the incremental saturation charge $Q_S$, but it would be required to find the total stored charge in the device.",

For a small variation around the operating point, we can write the total differential of $I_C$:\n$$dI_C = \\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}} dV_{BE,\\mathrm{int}} + \\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}} dV_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}$$\nThe partial derivatives are the small-signal parameters, the transconductance $g_m$ and the intrinsic output conductance $g_o$:\n$g_m = \\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}} \\left[ I_S \\exp\\left( \\frac{V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_T} \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_A} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{V_T} I_S \\exp\\left( \\frac{V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_T} \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_A} \\right) = \\frac{I_C}{V_T}$.\n$g_o = \\frac{\\partial I_C}{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}} \\left[ I_S \\exp\\left( \\frac{V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_T} \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_A} \\right) \\right] = I_S \\exp\\left( \\frac{V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}}{V_T} \\right) \\frac{1}{V_A}$.\nRecognizing that $I_C = I_S \\exp(V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}/V_T) (1 + V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}/V_A)$, we can write $I_S \\exp(V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}}/V_T) = I_C / (1 + V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}/V_A)$.\nThus, $g_o = \\frac{I_C}{V_A(1 + V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}/V_A)} = \\frac{I_C}{V_A + V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}}}$.\n\nAt the operating point, these parameters are $g_{m0} = I_{C0}/V_T$ and $g_{o0} = I_{C0}/(V_A + V_{CE,int,0})$.\nThe differentials of the internal voltages are found from their definitions, noting that $V_{BS}$ is constant ($dV_{BS}=0$):\n$d V_{BE,\\mathrm{int}} = d(V_{BS} - I_B R_B) = -dI_B R_B = -d(I_C/\\beta) R_B = -\\frac{R_B}{\\beta} dI_C$.\n$d V_{CE,\\mathrm{int}} = d(V_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}} - I_C R_C) = dV_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}} - R_C dI_C$.\n\nSubstituting these into the differential expression for $dI_C$:\n$$dI_C = g_m \\left(-\\frac{R_B}{\\beta} dI_C\\right) + g_o \\left(dV_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}} - R_C dI_C\\right)$$\nWe evaluate this at the operating point, so we use $g_{m0}$ and $g_{o0}$:\n$$dI_C = -g_{m0} \\frac{R_B}{\\beta} dI_C + g_{o0} dV_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}} - g_{o0} R_C dI_C$$\nNow, we group terms to solve for the output conductance $g_{out} = dI_C / dV_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}}$:\n$$dI_C \\left(1 + g_{m0} \\frac{R_B}{\\beta} + g_{o0} R_C\\right) = g_{o0} dV_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}}$$\n$$g_{out} = \\frac{dI_C}{dV_{CE,\\mathrm{ext}}} = \\frac{g_{o0}}{1 + g_{m0} \\frac{R_B}{\\beta} + g_{o0} R_C}$$\nThe apparent Early voltage is $V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} = I_{C0} / g_{out}$:\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{I_{C0}}{g_{o0}} \\left(1 + g_{m0} \\frac{R_B}{\\beta} + g_{o0} R_C\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $g_{m0}$ and $g_{o0}$:\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{I_{C0}}{I_{C0}/(V_A + V_{CE,int,0})} \\left(1 + \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_T} \\frac{R_B}{\\beta} + \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_A + V_{CE,int,0}} R_C\\right)$$\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} = (V_A + V_{CE,int,0}) \\left(1 + \\frac{I_{C0} R_B}{\\beta V_T} + \\frac{I_{C0} R_C}{V_A + V_{CE,int,0}}\\right)$$\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} = (V_A + V_{CE,int,0}) + (V_A + V_{CE,int,0}) \\frac{I_{C0} R_B}{\\beta V_T} + I_{C0} R_C$$\nThis expression depends on $V_{CE,int,0}$, which is not provided. To obtain the requested closed-form expression, we must make the standard approximation that the transistor operates with $V_{CE,int,0} \\ll V_A$. This is reasonable as Early voltages are typically tens of volts, while operating collector-emitter voltages are often a few volts. This approximation simplifies $g_{o0}$:\n$$g_{o0} = \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_A + V_{CE,int,0}} \\approx \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_A}$$\nWith this approximation, the derivation becomes:\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} \\approx \\frac{I_{C0}}{I_{C0}/V_A} \\left(1 + \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_T} \\frac{R_B}{\\beta} + \\frac{I_{C0}}{V_A} R_C\\right)$$\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} \\approx V_A \\left(1 + \\frac{I_{C0} R_B}{\\beta V_T} + \\frac{I_{C0} R_C}{V_A}\\right)$$\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} \\approx V_A + V_A \\frac{I_{C0} R_B}{\\beta V_T} + I_{C0} R_C$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the apparent Early voltage.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $V_A = 50\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $I_{C0} = 20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n- $R_B = 200\\ \\Omega$\n- $R_C = 5\\ \\Omega$\n- $\\beta = 100$\n- $V_T = 25.85 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nWe calculate the terms separately:\nThe first term is the intrinsic Early voltage, $V_A = 50\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nThe third term represents the effect of the collector resistance:\n$$I_{C0} R_C = (20 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (5\\ \\Omega) = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe second term represents the effect of the base resistance feedback:\n$$V_A \\frac{I_{C0} R_B}{\\beta V_T} = 50 \\times \\frac{(20 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 200}{100 \\times (25.85 \\times 10^{-3})} = 50 \\times \\frac{4}{2.585} \\approx 50 \\times 1.54738878 \\approx 77.369439\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nSumming the terms gives the apparent Early voltage:\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} \\approx 50 + 77.369439 + 0.1 = 127.469439\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$V_{A,\\mathrm{app}} \\approx 127.5\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe units are Volts, as expected for an Early voltage.",
