            "solution": "The user-supplied problem is a valid exercise in semiconductor device physics, resting on established principles of drift-diffusion transport, quasi-neutrality, and bipolar junction transistor (BJT) theory. All provided information is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the electron current density $J_n(x)$\n\nWe start from the fundamental relationship between the electron current density $J_n$ and the spatial gradient of the electron quasi-Fermi level, $E_{Fn}$:\n$$\nJ_n(x) = n(x) \\mu_n \\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $n(x)$ is the electron concentration and $\\mu_n$ is the electron mobility.\n\nThe electron and hole concentrations can be expressed in terms of their respective quasi-Fermi levels, $E_{Fn}$ and $E_{Fp}$, and the intrinsic Fermi level $E_i$:\n$$\nn(x) = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_i(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np(x) = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe ratio of the minority to majority carrier concentrations is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)} = \\frac{n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_i(x)}{k_B T}\\right)}{n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nWe now differentiate this ratio with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{Fn}(x) - E_{Fp}(x)}{k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx} - \\frac{dE_{Fp}(x)}{dx}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}$ back into this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right) = \\frac{n(x)}{p(x)} \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx} - \\frac{dE_{Fp}(x)}{dx}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the internal quasi-electric field adjusts to maintain a flat hole quasi-Fermi level. This implies that the spatial gradient of $E_{Fp}$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{Fp}(x)}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThe derivative of the ratio then simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right) = \\frac{n(x)}{p(x)} \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this to express the gradient of the electron quasi-Fermi level:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{Fn}(x)}{dx} = \\frac{p(x)}{n(x)} k_B T \\fracd}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\frac{dE_{Fn}}{dx}$ into the equation for $J_n(x)$:\n$$\nJ_n(x) = n(x) \\mu_n \\left[ \\frac{p(x)}{n(x)} k_B T \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right) \\right] = \\mu_n p(x) k_B T \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the Einstein relation $D_n = \\mu_n V_T$ and the definition of thermal voltage $V_T = k_B T/q$, we can write $\\mu_n k_B T = q D_n$. Substituting this gives the desired expression for the electron current density:\n$$\nJ_n(x) = q D_n p(x) \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right)\n$$\n\nPart 2: Integration to find $J_n$ and $I_C$\n\nThe problem states that recombination in the base is negligible, which implies conservation of electron current. Therefore, the divergence of the current density is zero. In one dimension, this means $dJ_n/dx = 0$, so $J_n$ is constant throughout the quasi-neutral base. We can rearrange the expression from Part 1 and integrate across the base from $x=0$ to $x=W_B$:\n$$\n\\frac{J_n}{q D_n p(x)} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right)\n$$\nAs $J_n$ and $q$ are constants, and $D_n$ is given as constant, we integrate:\n$$\n\\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{J_n}{q D_n p(x)} dx = \\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{n(x)}{p(x)}\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{J_n}{q} \\int_0^{W_B} \\frac{dx}{D_n p(x)} = \\left[ \\frac{n(x)}{p(x)} \\right]_0^{W_B} = \\frac{n(W_B)}{p(W_B)} - \\frac{n(0)}{p(0)}\n$$\nThe problem defines the base Gummel number $G_B$ as $G_B \\equiv \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\frac{dx}{D_n p(x)}$. Substituting this definition:\n$$\n\\frac{J_n}{q} G_B = \\frac{n(W_B)}{p(W_B)} - \\frac{n(0)}{p(0)}\n$$\nSolving for $J_n$:\n$$\nJ_n = \\frac{q}{G_B} \\left( \\frac{n(W_B)}{p(W_B)} - \\frac{n(0)}{p(0)} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the collector current as $I_C = A J_n$. For a conventional NPN BJT, electrons flow from emitter to collector (in the $+x$ direction), so the conventional current is in the $-x$ direction. Therefore, $J_n$ as derived would be negative. However, the problem's definition $I_C = A J_n$ implies that $J_n$ is the magnitude of the current density. We thus take the magnitude by reversing the terms in the parenthesis, since $n(0)/p(0) \\gg n(W_B)/p(W_B)$ for a forward-biased emitter-base junction.\n$$\nJ_n = \\frac{q}{G_B} \\left( \\frac{n(0)}{p(0)} - \\frac{n(W_B)}{p(W_B)} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given boundary conditions, $n(0)=n_i^2 p(0)^{-1} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$ and $n(W_B) \\approx n_i^2 p(W_B)^{-1}$:\n$$\nJ_n = \\frac{q}{G_B} \\left( \\frac{n_i^2}{p(0)^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - \\frac{n_i^2}{p(W_B)^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe collector current is $I_C = A J_n$:\n$$\nI_C = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_B} \\left( \\frac{1}{p(0)^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - \\frac{1}{p(W_B)^2} \\right)\n$$\n\nPart 3: Gummel numbers and current ratio\n\nFirst, we compute the Gummel number for the exponentially graded base, $p(x) = p_0 \\exp(\\alpha x)$, with constant $D_n$.\n$$\nG_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\frac{dx}{D_n p_0 \\exp(\\alpha x)} = \\frac{1}{D_n p_0} \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\exp(-\\alpha x) dx\n$$\n$$\nG_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = \\frac{1}{D_n p_0} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\alpha x) \\right]_0^{W_B} = \\frac{1}{D_n p_0 \\alpha} \\left( -\\exp(-\\alpha W_B) - (-1) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nG_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha W_B)}{D_n p_0 \\alpha}\n$$\nNext, for a uniform base with the same properties, $p(x) = p_0$.\n$$\nG_B^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\frac{dx}{D_n p_0} = \\frac{1}{D_n p_0} \\int_0^{W_B} dx = \\frac{W_B}{D_n p_0}\n$$\nFinally, we find the ratio of collector currents $I_C^{(\\mathrm{exp})} / I_C^{(\\mathrm{uni})}$. For the exponential case, $p(0) = p_0$ and $p(W_B) = p_0 \\exp(\\alpha W_B)$.\n$$\nI_C^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})}} \\left( \\frac{1}{p_0^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - \\frac{1}{(p_0 \\exp(\\alpha W_B))^2} \\right) = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})} p_0^2} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - \\exp(-2\\alpha W_B) \\right)\n$$\nFor the uniform case, $p(0) = p_0$ and $p(W_B) = p_0$.\n$$\nI_C^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_B^{(\\mathrm{uni})}} \\left( \\frac{1}{p_0^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - \\frac{1}{p_0^2} \\right) = \\frac{A q n_i^2}{G_B^{(\\mathrm{uni})} p_0^2} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{I_C^{(\\mathrm{exp})}}{I_C^{(\\mathrm{uni})}} = \\frac{G_B^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}{G_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})}} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - \\exp(-2\\alpha W_B)}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1}\n$$\nUnder forward-active operation, $V_{BE} > 0$ and is typically many times $V_T$. Thus, $\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) \\gg 1$ and $\\exp(V_{BE}/V_T) \\gg \\exp(-2\\alpha W_B)$. Under this valid physical approximation, the ratio of the bracketed terms approaches $1$. The current ratio simplifies to the inverse ratio of the Gummel numbers:\n$$\n\\frac{I_C^{(\\mathrm{exp})}}{I_C^{(\\mathrm{uni})}} \\approx \\frac{G_B^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}{G_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})}} = \\frac{W_B/(D_n p_0)}{\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha W_B)\\right)/(D_n p_0 \\alpha)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{I_C^{(\\mathrm{exp})}}{I_C^{(\\mathrm{uni})}} = \\frac{W_B \\cdot D_n p_0 \\alpha}{D_n p_0 \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha W_B)\\right)} = \\frac{\\alpha W_B}{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha W_B)}\n$$\nThis ratio represents the enhancement in collector current due to the drift field in the graded base.\n\nWe are asked for two results: the exponentially graded-base $G_B$ and the current ratio. These are:\n$1.$ $G_B^{(\\mathrm{exp})} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha W_B)}{D_n p_0 \\alpha}$\n$2.$ $\\frac{I_C^{(\\mathrm{exp})}}{I_C^{(\\mathrm{uni})}} = \\frac{\\alpha W_B}{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha W_B)}$\nThese will be presented in a two-entry row matrix.",
