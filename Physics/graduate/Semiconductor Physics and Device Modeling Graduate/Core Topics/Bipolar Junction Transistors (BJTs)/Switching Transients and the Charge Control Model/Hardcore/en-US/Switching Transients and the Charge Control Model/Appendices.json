            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time-dependent areal stored excess carrier charge density, $Q_A(t)$, in a semiconductor slab under specific initial and boundary conditions. The solution must be obtained using a charge-control model based on an approximation involving the steady-state carrier profile.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical equations. The transport of excess minority carriers, $\\Delta n(x,t)$, is described by the one-dimensional continuity equation, assuming low-level injection and negligible drift:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x,t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the minority-carrier diffusion coefficient and $\\tau$ is the minority-carrier lifetime, both assumed to be uniform constants.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the areal stored excess carrier charge density, defined as:\n$$\nQ_A(t) = q \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx\n$$\nIt is convenient to first work with the total number of excess carriers per unit area, $N(t)$:\n$$\nN(t) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx \\implies Q_A(t) = q N(t)\n$$\nTo derive an ordinary differential equation for $N(t)$, we integrate the continuity equation over the length of the slab, from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial t} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n}{\\tau} \\right) \\, dx\n$$\nBy interchanging the order of differentiation and integration on the left side, and distributing the integral on the right side, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx = D \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta n}{\\partial x^2} \\, dx - \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{L} \\Delta n(x,t) \\, dx\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = D \\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x} \\right]_{x=0}^{x=L} - \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a perfectly reflecting boundary at $x=L$, which translates to a zero-flux condition: $\\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=L} = 0$. Applying this boundary condition simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -D \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} - \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis is the charge-control equation. The term $F(t) = -D \\frac{\\partial \\Delta n}{\\partial x}\\big|_{x=0}$ represents the flux of minority carriers entering the slab at $x=0$. The equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} + \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau} = F(t)\n$$\nTo solve this equation for $N(t)$, we must determine the driving term, $F(t)$. This is where the specified charge-control approximation is invoked. The problem states that the model approximates the spatial profile by the corresponding steady-state shape. This implies that the relationship between the boundary concentration and the boundary gradient (which determines the flux) is assumed to be the same as in steady state. Since the boundary concentration is held at a constant value $\\Delta n(0,t) = \\Delta n_s$ for $t \\geq 0$, the flux $F(t)$ is approximated by its constant, steady-state value, $F_{ss}$.\n\nTo find $F_{ss}$, we must first find the steady-state excess carrier profile, $\\Delta n_{ss}(x)$, by solving the time-independent continuity equation:\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n_{ss}}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n_{ss}}{\\tau} \\implies \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n_{ss}}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n_{ss}}{L_D^2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $L_D = \\sqrt{D\\tau}$ is the minority-carrier diffusion length. The above equation is a second-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation whose general solution is:\n$$\n\\Delta n_{ss}(x) = A \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right) + B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the steady-state boundary conditions:\n1. $\\Delta n_{ss}(0) = \\Delta n_s$\n2. $\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0$\n\nFrom the first condition: $\\Delta n_s = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) \\implies A = \\Delta n_s$.\nTo apply the second condition, we first find the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx} = \\frac{A}{L_D} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right) + \\frac{B}{L_D} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nAt $x=L$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) + \\frac{B}{L_D} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) \\implies B = -\\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThe steady-state profile is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta n_{ss}(x) = \\Delta n_s \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right) - \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be simplified using the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(a-b)=\\cosh(a)\\cosh(b)-\\sinh(a)\\sinh(b)$:\n$$\n\\Delta n_{ss}(x) = \\Delta n_s \\frac{\\cosh(L/L_D)\\cosh(x/L_D) - \\sinh(L/L_D)\\sinh(x/L_D)}{\\cosh(L/L_D)} = \\Delta n_s \\frac{\\cosh((L-x)/L_D)}{\\cosh(L/L_D)}\n$$\nNow we compute the steady-state flux $F_{ss}$:\n$$\nF_{ss} = -D \\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0}\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx} = \\frac{\\Delta n_s}{\\cosh(L/L_D)} \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_D}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{L-x}{L_D}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Delta n_{ss}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D \\cosh(L/L_D)} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the steady-state flux is:\n$$\nF_{ss} = -D \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{D \\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this constant flux into our charge-control ODE for $t \\geq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} + \\frac{N(t)}{\\tau} = \\frac{D \\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. The initial condition is $N(0)=0$, since there are no excess carriers for $t < 0$. The solution is of the form $N(t) = N_h(t) + N_p(t)$, where $N_h(t)$ is the homogeneous solution and $N_p(t)$ is the particular solution.\nThe homogeneous solution is $N_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ for some constant $C$.\nThe particular solution for a constant right-hand side is a constant, $N_p$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$$\n0 + \\frac{N_p}{\\tau} = F_{ss} \\implies N_p = \\tau F_{ss}\n$$\nThe general solution is $N(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) + \\tau F_{ss}$. Applying the initial condition $N(0)=0$:\n$$\n0 = C \\exp(0) + \\tau F_{ss} \\implies C = -\\tau F_{ss}\n$$\nThus, the solution for $N(t)$ is:\n$$\nN(t) = \\tau F_{ss} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_{ss}$ and using $L_D^2 = D\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau F_{ss} = \\tau \\frac{D \\Delta n_s}{L_D} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau D}{L_D} \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right) = \\frac{L_D^2}{L_D} \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau F_{ss} = L_D \\Delta n_s \\tanh\\left(\\frac{L}{L_D}\\right)\n$$\nThis final steady-state value of the total charge is $N_{ss}$.

It represents a standard problem in MOSFET device physics, specifically concerning the calculation of gate charge and capacitance under transient conditions using the charge control model. The provided approximations and constraints are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the time-dependent gate current $i_{G}(t)$ and the effective input capacitance $C_{in,\\mathrm{eff}}(V_{GS}, V_{DS})$. We begin by formulating an expression for the total gate charge, $Q_{G}(V_{GS}, V_{DS})$.\n\nThe total gate charge $Q_{G}$ is the sum of the charge on the gate electrode mirroring the channel inversion layer, $Q_{G,inv}$, and the charges associated with the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain overlap regions, $Q_{G,ov,gs}$ and $Q_{G,ov,gd}$, respectively.\n$$Q_{G} = Q_{G,inv} + Q_{G,ov,gs} + Q_{G,ov,gd}$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the channel-related charge, $Q_{G,inv}$. Under the gradual-channel approximation in strong inversion, the charge density per unit area on the gate at a position $x$ along the channel is given by:\n$$Q'_{g}(x) = C_{ox} (V_{GC}(x) - V_{T})$$\nwhere $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $V_{T}$ is the constant threshold voltage, and $V_{GC}(x)$ is the local potential difference between the gate and the channel. With the source as the reference terminal ($V_S=0$), the gate potential is $V_{G} = V_{GS}$, and the channel potential at position $x$ is $V(x)$. Thus, $V_{GC}(x) = V_{GS} - V(x)$.\n$$Q'_{g}(x) = C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{T})$$\nTo find the total gate charge over the channel, we integrate this density over the area of the gate, which is $W \\times L$. Assuming uniformity in the width direction:\n$$Q_{G,inv} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{W} Q'_{g}(x) \\, dy \\, dx = W \\int_{0}^{L} C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V(x) - V_{T}) \\, dx$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to use the linear approximation for the channel potential in the triode region:\n$$V(x) \\approx \\frac{V_{DS}}{L} x$$\nThis approximation is physically most accurate for small $V_{DS}$ ($V_{DS} \\ll V_{GS} - V_{T}$), but its use is mandated here for the entire specified operating range. Substituting this expression for $V(x)$ into the integral for $Q_{G,inv}$:\n$$Q_{G,inv} = W C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L} x \\right) \\, dx$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$Q_{G,inv} = W C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_{T})x - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L} \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{L}$$\n$$Q_{G,inv} = W C_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS} - V_{T})L - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L} \\frac{L^2}{2} \\right)$$\nSimplifying, we obtain the expression for the gate charge over the channel:\n$$Q_{G,inv} = W L C_{ox} \\left( V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2} \\right)$$\nNext, we consider the overlap charge components. The gate-source overlap capacitance is $C_{ov,gs}$ and the gate-drain overlap capacitance is $C_{ov,gd}$. The charge stored in these capacitive components is:\n$$Q_{G,ov,gs} = C_{ov,gs} V_{GS}$$\n$$Q_{G,ov,gd} = C_{ov,gd} V_{GD}$$\nThe gate-to-drain voltage $V_{GD}$ can be expressed in terms of the given voltages: $V_{GD} = V_G - V_D = (V_G-V_S) - (V_D-V_S) = V_{GS} - V_{DS}$.\n$$Q_{G,ov,gd} = C_{ov,gd} (V_{GS} - V_{DS})$$\nCombining all components, the total gate charge $Q_{G}$ is:\n$$Q_{G}(V_{GS}, V_{DS}) = W L C_{ox} \\left( V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2} \\right) + C_{ov,gs} V_{GS} + C_{ov,gd} (V_{GS} - V_{DS})$$\n\nNow we can derive the two required quantities.\n\n1. Time-dependent gate current $i_{G}(t)$.\nThe gate current is the total time derivative of the gate charge, $i_{G}(t) = \\frac{dQ_{G}}{dt}$. Since $Q_G$ is a function of $V_{GS}$ and $V_{DS}$, which may vary with time, we use the chain rule:\n$$i_{G}(t) = \\frac{\\partial Q_{G}}{\\partial V_{GS}} \\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial Q_{G}}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt}$$\nFrom the problem statement, the gate-to-source voltage is a linear ramp, $V_{GS}(t) = V_{GS,0} + S t$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt} = S$$\nThe drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$ is held constant, so:\n$$\\frac{dV_{DS}}{dt} = 0$$\nThe expression for the gate current simplifies to:\n$$i_{G}(t) = S \\frac{\\partial Q_{G}}{\\partial V_{GS}}$$\nWe compute the partial derivative of $Q_{G}$ with respect to $V_{GS}$ holding $V_{DS}$ constant.

This is a direct consequence of the linear model for charge and potential mandated by the problem.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the current:\n$$i_{G}(t) = S \\left( W L C_{ox} + C_{ov,gs} + C_{ov,gd} \\right)$$\nThe gate current is constant throughout the ramp, a result of charging a constant effective capacitance with a linearly increasing voltage.\n\n2.

Although the problem asks for the result as a function of $V_{GS}(t)$ and $V_{DS}$, the derived expression under the given assumptions shows no dependence on these voltages.\n\nThe final expressions for the gate current and effective input capacitance are:\n$i_{G}(t) = S(WLC_{ox} + C_{ov,gs} + C_{ov,gd})$\n$C_{in,\\mathrm{eff}} = WLC_{ox} + C_{ov,gs} + C_{ov,gd}$",

A gate-voltage excitation at the source end applies a monotonic input ramp with rise time $t_r$ that changes the inversion charge.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a dimensionless figure of merit to quantify the validity of the quasi-static approximation in a long-channel MOSFET transient response. This figure of merit must be derived from first principles, namely the one-dimensional charge continuity equation and the drift current relation, and be expressed in terms of the given parameters: channel length $L$, carrier mobility $\\mu$, drain-to-source voltage $V$, and input ramp rise time $t_r$.\n\nThe quasi-static (QS) approximation posits that the charge distribution within the device responds instantaneously to changes in terminal voltages. The validity of this approximation hinges on the comparison between the intrinsic response time of the channel and the time scale of the external electrical stimulus. If the internal response is much faster than the external change, the QS model is accurate. If the two time scales are comparable, non-quasi-static (NQS) effects become significant, and the QS model introduces error.\n\nOur first step is to determine the characteristic time for charge dynamics within the channel. This is the time it takes for charge information to propagate from one end of the channel to the other. We begin with the one-dimensional charge continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of charge:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q'_{inv}(x,t)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial I(x,t)}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nIn this equation, $x$ is the position along the channel (from source at $x=0$ to drain at $x=L$), $t$ is time, $Q'_{inv}(x,t)$ is the inversion charge per unit length, and $I(x,t)$ is the channel current.\n\nThe current is due to the drift of charge carriers in the longitudinal electric field. The drift current relation is given by:\n$$\nI(x,t) = Q'_{inv}(x,t) \\cdot v_{drift}(x)\n$$\nwhere $v_{drift}(x)$ is the carrier drift velocity. The velocity is related to the local longitudinal electric field $E(x)$ through the carrier mobility $\\mu$:\n$$\nv_{drift}(x) = \\mu E(x)\n$$\nThe problem states that the transistor operates in the linear regime and specifies that the longitudinal electric field is approximately uniform along the channel. This uniform field $E$ can be approximated by the total voltage drop $V$ across the channel length $L$:\n$$\nE \\approx \\frac{V}{L}\n$$\nUnder this assumption, the drift velocity becomes constant along the channel:\n$$\nv_{drift} = \\mu \\frac{V}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting the drift current relation into the continuity equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q'_{inv}(x,t)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( Q'_{inv}(x,t) \\cdot v_{drift} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $v_{drift}$ is treated as a constant, it can be taken out of the partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q'_{inv}}{\\partial t} + v_{drift} \\frac{\\partial Q'_{inv}}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional transport (or advection) equation. It describes a quantity, in this case the inversion charge perturbation $Q'_{inv}$, propagating along the $x$-axis with a constant velocity $v_{drift}$. This velocity represents the speed at which charge information travels along the channel.\n\nThe characteristic time for charge rearrangement along the entire channel is the time it takes for a charge carrier to traverse the channel length $L$ at this velocity. This time is known as the channel transit time, which we denote as $\\tau_t$.\n$$\n\\tau_t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{velocity}} = \\frac{L}{v_{drift}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{drift}$:\n$$\n\\tau_t = \\frac{L}{\\mu V / L} = \\frac{L^2}{\\mu V}\n$$\nThis transit time $\\tau_t$ is the intrinsic time scale characterizing the response of the channel charge.\n\nThe problem describes an external stimulus in the form of a gate voltage ramp with a rise time $t_r$. This time $t_r$ represents the characteristic time scale of the input signal driving the transient.\n\nThe breakdown of the quasi-static approximation occurs when the internal response time $\\tau_t$ is not negligibly small compared to the external driving time $t_r$. A dimensionless figure of merit (FoM) that governs the significance of NQS effects can be constructed by taking the ratio of these two time scales. We want the FoM to be large when NQS effects are important, which is when $\\tau_t$ is large relative to $t_r$. Therefore, we define the FoM as the ratio of the transit time to the rise time:\n$$\n\\text{FoM} = \\frac{\\tau_t}{t_r}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\tau_t$:\n$$\n\\text{FoM} = \\frac{L^2 / (\\mu V)}{t_r} = \\frac{L^2}{\\mu V t_r}\n$$\nThis expression is a dimensionless quantity that compares the channel's physical transit time to the signal's rise time. If this FoM is much less than $1$, the channel responds much faster than the signal changes, and a quasi-static model is accurate. If the FoM is on the order of $1$ or greater, the channel's finite response speed becomes a limiting factor, and the quasi-static model will lead to significant errors. The derived expression is in the closed-form analytic form required and uses only the specified variables.",
