The base is quasi-neutral with uniform recombination characterized by a minority electron diffusion length $L_n$ and electron diffusion constant $D_{n,B}$. The emitter is quasi-neutral with width $W_E$ and minority hole diffusion constant $D_{p,E}$. Assume the minority hole diffusion length in the emitter is much larger than the emitter width (i.e., $L_{p,E} \\gg W_E$), so recombination in the emitter is negligible and the steady-state minority hole profile in the emitter is well approximated as linear. Let the emitter doping be $N_E$ and the base doping be $N_B$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the common-base forward current gain $\\alpha_F$ for an NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) from first principles, followed by a numerical calculation and an analysis of the derived expression.\n\nThe problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All parameters provided are physically realistic, and the underlying model is a standard representation used in semiconductor device physics. The problem is self-contained, as fundamental constants like the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ and the thermal voltage $V_T$ will cancel out in the final expression for $\\alpha_F$.\n\nThe common-base forward current gain $\\alpha_F$ is defined as the ratio of the collector current $I_C$ to the emitter current $I_E$ in the forward-active mode of operation ($V_{BE} > 0$, $V_{CB} \\ge 0$). For an NPN transistor, the currents are composed of electron and hole components.\n$$ \\alpha_F = \\frac{I_{Cn}}{I_E} = \\frac{I_{Cn}}{I_{En} + I_{Ep}} $$\nwhere $I_{Cn}$ is the electron current reaching the collector, $I_{En}$ is the electron current injected from the emitter into the base, and $I_{Ep}$ is the hole current injected from the base into the emitter. All currents are defined as positive magnitudes.\n\nThis can be expressed as the product of two factors: the base transport factor $\\alpha_T$ and the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma$.\n$$ \\alpha_F = \\alpha_T \\cdot \\gamma $$\nwhere\n$$ \\alpha_T = \\frac{I_{Cn}}{I_{En}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{I_{En}}{I_{En} + I_{Ep}} = \\frac{1}{1 + I_{Ep}/I_{En}} $$\n\nWe will derive the expressions for the current components by solving the steady-state drift-diffusion and continuity equations in the quasi-neutral base and emitter regions. We will work with current densities ($J$), assuming a uniform cross-sectional area $A$, such that $I = J \\cdot A$. The area $A$ will cancel out in the ratios.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Base Region and Calculation of $\\alpha_T$**\n\nThe base is a quasi-neutral p-type region. Under low-level injection, the current due to minority carriers (electrons) is dominated by diffusion. The steady-state continuity equation for excess minority electrons $\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$ in the base is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\delta n_p(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p(x)}{L_n^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $L_n = \\sqrt{D_{n,B} \\tau_n}$ is the minority electron diffusion length, with $D_{n,B}$ being the electron diffusion constant in the base and $\\tau_n$ the electron lifetime. We define the base region to extend from the edge of the emitter-base depletion region at $x=0$ to the edge of the collector-base depletion region at $x=W_B$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the emitter-base junction edge ($x=0$), which is forward-biased, the law of the junction applies:\n    $$ \\delta n_p(0) = n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\n    where $n_{p0}$ is the equilibrium electron concentration in the base.\n2.  At the collector-base junction edge ($x=W_B$), which is reverse-biased, all arriving electrons are collected. This implies the minority carrier concentration is driven to (near) zero.\n    $$ \\delta n_p(W_B) = 0 $$\n\nThe general solution to the differential equation is $\\delta n_p(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/L_n) + C_2 \\exp(-x/L_n)$. A more convenient form for applying the boundary conditions is using hyperbolic functions:\n$$ \\delta n_p(x) = A \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right) + C \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right) $$\nApplying the condition at $x=W_B$: $\\delta n_p(W_B) = A \\sinh(0) + C \\cosh(0) = C = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $\\delta n_p(x) = A \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right)$.\nApplying the condition at $x=0$: $\\delta n_p(0) = A \\sinh(W_B/L_n)$. Thus, $A = \\delta n_p(0) / \\sinh(W_B/L_n)$.\nThe excess electron profile in the base is:\n$$ \\delta n_p(x) = \\delta n_p(0) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)} $$\nThe electron diffusion current density is $J_n(x) = q D_{n,B} \\frac{d n_p}{dx} = q D_{n,B} \\frac{d \\delta n_p}{dx}$.\n$$ \\frac{d \\delta n_p}{dx} = -\\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{L_n \\sinh(W_B/L_n)} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right) $$\nThe electron current density injected into the base at $x=0$ is $J_{En}$:\n$$ J_{En} = |J_n(0)| = \\left| q D_{n,B} \\left( -\\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{L_n} \\coth\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) \\right) \\right| = \\frac{q D_{n,B} \\delta n_p(0)}{L_n} \\coth\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) $$\nThe electron current density collected at $x=W_B$ is $J_{Cn}$:\n$$ J_{Cn} = |J_n(W_B)| = \\left| q D_{n,B} \\left( -\\frac{\\delta n_p(0)}{L_n \\sinh(W_B/L_n)} \\right) \\right| = \\frac{q D_{n,B} \\delta n_p(0)}{L_n \\sinh(W_B/L_n)} $$\nThe base transport factor $\\alpha_T$ is the ratio of these currents:\n$$ \\alpha_T = \\frac{J_{Cn}}{J_{En}} = \\frac{1/\\sinh(W_B/L_n)}{\\coth(W_B/L_n)} = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(W_B/L_n)} $$\n\n**2. Analysis of the Emitter Region and Calculation of $\\gamma$**\n\nThe emitter is a quasi-neutral n-type region. The problem states that recombination is negligible ($L_{p,E} \\gg W_E$) and the minority carrier (hole) profile is linear. This corresponds to the \"short-base diode\" approximation. The continuity equation for excess holes $\\delta p_n(x')$ in the emitter becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\delta p_n(x')}{dx'^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $x'$ is the coordinate in the emitter, with $x'=0$ at the EB junction edge and $x'=-W_E$ at the emitter contact.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the emitter-base junction edge ($x'=0$):\n    $$ \\delta p_n(0) = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\n    where $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium hole concentration in the emitter.\n2.  At the ohmic contact ($x'=-W_E$): the excess carrier concentration is zero.\n    $$ \\delta p_n(-W_E) = 0 $$\nThe solution to the differential equation is a linear function $\\delta p_n(x') = C_1 x' + C_2$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\nFrom $\\delta p_n(0) = C_2$, we get $C_2 = \\delta p_n(0)$.\nFrom $\\delta p_n(-W_E) = -C_1 W_E + C_2 = 0$, we get $C_1 = C_2/W_E = \\delta p_n(0)/W_E$.\nThe excess hole profile is $\\delta p_n(x') = \\delta p_n(0) (1 + x'/W_E)$.\nThe hole diffusion current density injected from the base into the emitter is $J_{Ep} = |-q D_{p,E} \\frac{d p_n}{dx'}|_{x'=0}$.\n$$ \\frac{d p_n}{dx'} = \\frac{d \\delta p_n}{dx'} = \\frac{\\delta p_n(0)}{W_E} $$\n$$ J_{Ep} = \\frac{q D_{p,E} \\delta p_n(0)}{W_E} $$\nThe emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma$ depends on the ratio $J_{Ep}/J_{En}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{Ep}}{J_{En}} = \\frac{q D_{p,E} \\delta p_n(0) / W_E}{q D_{n,B} \\delta n_p(0) / L_n \\coth(W_B/L_n)} = \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n}{D_{n,B} W_E \\coth(W_B/L_n)} \\frac{\\delta p_n(0)}{\\delta n_p(0)} $$\nUsing the law of the junction for both carriers, the ratio of excess concentrations at the junction is equal to the ratio of equilibrium concentrations: $\\delta p_n(0)/\\delta n_p(0) = p_{n0}/n_{p0}$.\nUsing the mass-action law ($n_i^2 = n_p$) and assuming full ionization of dopants ($n_{n0} \\approx N_E$, $p_{p0} \\approx N_B$):\n$p_{n0} = n_i^2 / N_E$ and $n_{p0} = n_i^2 / N_B$.\n$$ \\frac{p_{n0}}{n_{p0}} = \\frac{n_i^2/N_E}{n_i^2/N_B} = \\frac{N_B}{N_E} $$\nSubstituting this into the current ratio:\n$$ \\frac{J_{Ep}}{J_{En}} = \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n N_B}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E \\coth(W_B/L_n)} $$\nThen, the emitter injection efficiency is:\n$$ \\gamma = \\left( 1 + \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n N_B}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E \\coth(W_B/L_n)} \\right)^{-1} $$\n\n**3. Full Expression and Numerical Calculation for $\\alpha_F$**\n\nCombining the expressions for $\\alpha_T$ and $\\gamma$, we get the full analytical expression for $\\alpha_F$:\n$$ \\alpha_F = \\alpha_T \\cdot \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(W_B/L_n)} \\left( 1 + \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n N_B \\tanh(W_B/L_n)}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E} \\right)^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $W_B = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{cm}$\n- $L_n = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm}$\n- $D_{n,B} = 25\\ \\text{cm}^2/\\text{s}$\n- $N_E = 2.0 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n- $N_B = 1.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n- $W_E = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm}$\n- $D_{p,E} = 10\\ \\text{cm}^2/\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the key dimensionless ratio:\n$$ \\frac{W_B}{L_n} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{cm}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{cm}} = 0.05 $$\nCalculate the base transport factor $\\alpha_T$:\n$$ \\alpha_T = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(0.05)} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.00125026} \\approx 0.99875156 $$\nNext, calculate the ratio term for the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma$. Let's call this term $R_\\gamma$:\n$$ R_\\gamma = \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n N_B \\tanh(W_B/L_n)}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E} $$\n$$ R_\\gamma = \\frac{(10)(4.0 \\times 10^{-4})(1.0 \\times 10^{17})}{(25)(1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(2.0 \\times 10^{19})} \\tanh(0.05) $$\n$$ R_\\gamma = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{14}}{5.0 \\times 10^{16}} \\tanh(0.05) = 0.008 \\times \\tanh(0.05) $$\nUsing $\\tanh(0.05) \\approx 0.04995839$:\n$$ R_\\gamma \\approx 0.008 \\times 0.04995839 \\approx 0.000399667 $$\nCalculate the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = (1 + R_\\gamma)^{-1} \\approx (1 + 0.000399667)^{-1} \\approx 0.99960019 $$\nFinally, calculate $\\alpha_F$:\n$$ \\alpha_F = \\alpha_T \\cdot \\gamma \\approx 0.99875156 \\times 0.99960019 \\approx 0.99835215 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\alpha_F \\approx 0.9984$.\n\n**4. Analysis of Parameter Perturbations**\n\nTo increase $\\alpha_F$, we need to make it closer to $1$. This is equivalent to minimizing the quantity $1-\\alpha_F$. For values of $\\alpha_T$ and $\\gamma$ close to $1$, we can approximate:\n$$ 1 - \\alpha_F = 1 - \\alpha_T\\gamma \\approx (1-\\alpha_T) + (1-\\gamma) $$\nUsing the small-argument approximation $\\cosh(x) \\approx 1+x^2/2$ for $x=W_B/L_n \\ll 1$, the base transport factor deficiency is:\n$$ 1 - \\alpha_T = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\cosh(W_B/L_n)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{1+(W_B/L_n)^2/2} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)^2 $$\nThe emitter injection efficiency deficiency is:\n$$ 1 - \\gamma = 1 - \\frac{1}{1+R_\\gamma} \\approx R_\\gamma = \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n N_B \\tanh(W_B/L_n)}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E} $$\nUsing the approximation $\\tanh(x) \\approx x$ for $x \\ll 1$:\n$$ 1 - \\gamma \\approx \\frac{D_{p,E} L_n N_B}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E} \\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) = \\frac{D_{p,E} W_B N_B}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E} $$\nSo, to increase $\\alpha_F$, we must minimize:\n$$ 1 - \\alpha_F \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{D_{p,E} W_B N_B}{D_{n,B} W_E N_E} $$\nNumerically, the first term (base recombination) is $\\frac{1}{2}(0.05)^2 = 0.00125$. The second term (emitter injection defect) is $R_\\gamma \\approx 0.00040$. The base recombination is the dominant loss mechanism in this specific transistor.\n\nTo find the most effective single-parameter change to increase $\\alpha_F$, we should analyze which parameter has the strongest influence on reducing the sum of these two loss terms.\n- **Decreasing Base Width ($W_B$):** This parameter appears in both terms. Decreasing $W_B$ reduces the first term quadratically and the second term linearly. This has a strong, dual benefit, improving both the base transport factor and the emitter injection efficiency.\n- **Increasing Emitter Doping ($N_E$):** This increases $\\gamma$ by reducing the second term (inversely proportional). It has no effect on $\\alpha_T$. This is a standard and effective method.\n- **Decreasing Base Doping ($N_B$):** This increases $\\gamma$ by reducing the second term (linearly proportional). It has no effect on $\\alpha_T$. This is also effective.\n- **Increasing Electron Diffusion Length in the Base ($L_n$):** This improves $\\alpha_T$ by reducing the first term (inversely proportional to $L_n^2$). Its effect on $\\gamma$ is slightly negative (as $L_n \\tanh(W_B/L_n)$ increases slowly with $L_n$), but this effect is small. The dominant effect is the improvement in $\\alpha_T$.\n\nComparing the options, **decreasing the base width $W_B$** is the most effective single-parameter perturbation. This is because it strongly improves the larger of the two loss components (the base transport factor defect, which depends on $W_B^2$) while also improving the second loss component (the emitter efficiency defect, which depends on $W_B$). No other single parameter beneficially affects both loss mechanisms simultaneously. While changes to doping ($N_E$, $N_B$) are very important for emitter efficiency, in this case, the base transport is the larger limiting factor, making $W_B$ the most critical parameter to adjust.",

Substituting the expression for $\\alpha_T$:\n$$\n\\alpha_F(W_B) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)}\n$$\nTo find the sensitivity of $\\alpha_F$ with respect to the base width $W_B$, we compute the partial derivative $\\partial \\alpha_F/\\partial W_B$, holding $\\gamma$ and $L_n$ constant.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_F}{\\partial W_B} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W_B} \\left[ \\gamma \\left(\\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)\\right)^{-1} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_F}{\\partial W_B} = \\gamma \\left[ -1 \\left(\\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{L_n} \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the sensitivity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_F}{\\partial W_B} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{L_n} \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)}{\\cosh^{2}\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)}\n$$\nThis can also be written in terms of other hyperbolic functions as $-\\frac{\\gamma}{L_n} \\text{sech}\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) \\tanh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)$.\n\nFor the physical interpretation: The quantities $\\gamma$, $L_n$, $W_B$ are positive. For $W_B > 0$, both $\\sinh(W_B/L_n)$ and $\\cosh(W_B/L_n)$ are positive. Therefore, the entire expression for the sensitivity $\\partial \\alpha_F/\\partial W_B$ is negative. This signifies that the common-base current gain $\\alpha_F$ decreases as the base width $W_B$ increases. A physically wider base allows for a greater probability of minority carrier recombination during transit, which reduces the fraction of injected electrons that reach the collector. This lowers the base transport factor $\\alpha_T$, and consequently, $\\alpha_F$.\n\nThe common-emitter current gain $\\beta = \\alpha_F/(1-\\alpha_F)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\alpha_F$, and is extremely sensitive to changes in $\\alpha_F$ when $\\alpha_F$ is close to $1$. To optimize transistor performance and achieve high amplification ($\\beta \\gg 1$), $\\alpha_F$ must be as close to $1$ as possible. Our result shows that this is achieved by making the base width $W_B$ as small as technologically feasible relative to the minority carrier diffusion length $L_n$.",

            "problem": "Consider an $n$-$p$-$n$ Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) operated in forward active mode with common-emitter bias. The objective is to predict the net effect on the common-emitter current gain $\\beta$ due to Joule self-heating and the resulting temperature rise $\\Delta T$ at high current densities, accounting for temperature-induced mobility reduction and increased recombination. The program must compute, for each specified test case, the self-consistent $\\beta$ under Joule self-heating and also report the ambient (no-self-heating) $\\beta$, using a physically grounded model based on diffusion transport in the base.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases and modeling assumptions:\n- The common-base current gain $\\alpha$ is defined as $\\alpha = I_C / I_E$, and the common-emitter current gain $\\beta$ is defined as $\\beta = I_C / I_B$, where $I_C$ is the collector current, $I_E$ is the emitter current, and $I_B$ is the base current. From these definitions, the identity $\\beta = \\alpha / (1 - \\alpha)$ follows.\n- The minority-carrier electron transport in the uniformly doped base is governed by the one-dimensional steady-state diffusion-recombination equation $d^2 \\delta n(x) / dx^2 = \\delta n(x) / L_n^2$, where $\\delta n(x)$ is the excess minority electron concentration, and $L_n$ is the electron diffusion length in the base. For a base of width $W_B$ with negligible electric field and uniform recombination, the base transport factor is modeled as $\\alpha_T = \\operatorname{sech}\\!\\left(W_B / L_n\\right) = 1 / \\cosh\\!\\left(W_B / L_n\\right)$.\n- The forward common-base gain is $\\alpha = \\gamma \\, \\alpha_T$, where $\\gamma$ is the emitter injection efficiency, assumed temperature-independent and close to unity due to heavy emitter doping.\n- The electron diffusion coefficient in the base is given by the Einstein relation $D_n(T) = \\mu_n(T) \\, k_B \\, T / q$, where $\\mu_n(T)$ is the electron mobility at temperature $T$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $q$ is the elementary charge. The electron diffusion length is $L_n(T) = \\sqrt{D_n(T) \\, \\tau_n(T)}$, where $\\tau_n(T)$ is the minority electron lifetime in the base.\n- Temperature dependencies are modeled as $\\mu_n(T) = \\mu_{n0} \\left(T/T_0\\right)^{-m}$ and $\\tau_n(T) = \\tau_{n0} \\left(T/T_0\\right)^{-p}$, where $\\mu_{n0}$ and $\\tau_{n0}$ are the mobility and lifetime at reference temperature $T_0$, and $m$ and $p$ are non-negative exponents reflecting phonon scattering and recombination kinetics, respectively.\n- Joule self-heating is modeled by a lumped thermal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{th}}$ between the device and the ambient. The temperature rise is $\\Delta T = R_{\\mathrm{th}} \\, P$, where $P = V_{CE} \\, I_C$ is the electric power dissipation, $V_{CE}$ is the collector-emitter voltage, and $I_C$ is the collector current. Thus, $T = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T$, with $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ the ambient temperature.\n\nThese relations imply a self-consistent fixed-point problem because $I_C = \\beta(T) \\, I_B$ depends on $T$ through $\\beta(T)$, while $T$ depends on $I_C$ through Joule heating. Your program must solve this fixed point by iteration for each test case until convergence in temperature is achieved to a prescribed tolerance. If the iteration does not converge within a reasonable number of steps, the program should provide the last iterate’s value as the approximate solution, ensuring numerical stability by reasonable safeguards.\n\nImplement the following computational steps for each test case:\n1. Compute the ambient-temperature result by setting $T = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ and evaluating $\\mu_n(T)$, $D_n(T)$, $\\tau_n(T)$, $L_n(T)$, $\\alpha_T(T)$, $\\alpha(T)$, and finally $\\beta(T) = \\alpha(T) / \\left(1 - \\alpha(T)\\right)$.\n2. Solve the self-consistent temperature with Joule heating by iterating:\n   - Initialize $T \\leftarrow T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$.\n   - At each iteration, compute $\\beta(T)$ as in step $1$, then $I_C = \\beta(T) \\, I_B$, $P = V_{CE} \\, I_C$, and $T_{\\text{new}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + R_{\\mathrm{th}} \\, P$.\n   - Update the temperature with relaxation $T \\leftarrow (1 - \\lambda) \\, T + \\lambda \\, T_{\\text{new}}$, with $0 < \\lambda \\leq 1$.\n   - Terminate when $\\left|T_{\\text{new}} - T\\right|$ is below the specified tolerance.\n3.

Use reasonable safeguards such as limiting the temperature during iteration to a physically plausible range.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. For each test case, output two values in order: first the ambient-temperature $\\beta$ (no self-heating), then the self-consistent heated $\\beta$. The concatenated output for all four test cases must therefore contain eight decimal numbers in total, for example, $[\\beta_{1,\\mathrm{amb}},\\beta_{1,\\mathrm{heated}},\\beta_{2,\\mathrm{amb}},\\beta_{2,\\mathrm{heated}},\\beta_{3,\\mathrm{amb}},\\beta_{3,\\mathrm{heated}},\\beta_{4,\\mathrm{amb}},\\beta_{4,\\mathrm{heated}}]$.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in semiconductor device physics, is mathematically well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of parameters and physical models to arrive at a unique solution. The task is to compute the common-emitter current gain, $\\beta$, of a Bipolar Junction Transistor under two conditions: at a fixed ambient temperature and under self-heating due to power dissipation. This requires solving a self-consistent electro-thermal problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we establish the function relating the transistor's temperature to its current gain, $\\beta(T)$. Second, we use this function to find the self-consistent operating temperature and the corresponding gain through a fixed-point iteration.\n\nThe core of the model is the dependence of the common-emitter gain $\\beta$ on temperature $T$. The relationship is given by the identity $\\beta(T) = \\alpha(T) / (1 - \\alpha(T))$, where $\\alpha(T)$ is the common-base current gain. The gain $\\alpha(T)$ is modeled as the product of the emitter injection efficiency $\\gamma$ and the base transport factor $\\alpha_T(T)$, such that $\\alpha(T) = \\gamma \\alpha_T(T)$. The parameter $\\gamma$ is assumed to be a constant, independent of temperature.\n\nThe base transport factor, $\\alpha_T(T)$, captures the efficiency of minority carrier transport across the base region and is given by $\\alpha_T(T) = \\operatorname{sech}(W_B / L_n(T))$, where $W_B$ is the physical base width and $L_n(T)$ is the temperature-dependent minority electron diffusion length in the base.\n\nThe diffusion length $L_n(T)$ itself depends on temperature through the relation $L_n(T) = \\sqrt{D_n(T) \\tau_n(T)}$. Here, $\\tau_n(T)$ is the minority electron lifetime and $D_n(T)$ is the diffusion coefficient. Their temperature dependencies are governed by the following physical models:\n1.  The electron lifetime is modeled by a power law: $\\tau_n(T) = \\tau_{n0} (T/T_0)^{-p}$, where $\\tau_{n0}$ is the lifetime at a reference temperature $T_0$, and $p$ is an exponent related to the recombination mechanism.\n2.  The diffusion coefficient $D_n(T)$ is given by the Einstein relation, $D_n(T) = \\mu_n(T) \\, k_B \\, T / q$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $q$ is the elementary charge.\n3.  The electron mobility $\\mu_n(T)$ also follows a power law, $\\mu_n(T) = \\mu_{n0} (T/T_0)^{-m}$, which primarily models the effect of lattice phonon scattering.\n\nCombining these expressions, we can write the squared diffusion length as a direct function of temperature:\n$$L_n(T)^2 = D_n(T) \\tau_n(T) = \\left( \\mu_{n0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{-m} \\frac{k_B T}{q} \\right) \\left( \\tau_{n0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{-p} \\right) = \\left(\\mu_{n0} \\tau_{n0} \\frac{k_B T_0^{m+p}}{q}\\right) T^{1-m-p}$$\nThis equation shows that as temperature $T$ increases, $L_n(T)$ decreases, because the exponents $m$ and $p$ are non-negative and typically sum to a value greater than $1$. A smaller $L_n(T)$ implies a larger argument $W_B/L_n(T)$ for the $\\operatorname{sech}$ function, leading to a smaller $\\alpha_T(T)$. Consequently, both $\\alpha(T)$ and $\\beta(T)$ decrease as temperature rises. This is the physical basis for the negative feedback that stabilizes the device temperature.\n\nThe computational task consists of two main calculations for each test case:\n\n1.  **Ambient Gain Calculation**: The ambient-temperature common-emitter gain, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, is calculated by evaluating the function $\\beta(T)$ at the specified ambient temperature, $T = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$. This provides a baseline value without the effect of self-heating.\n\n2.  **Self-Consistent Heated Gain Calculation**: Joule self-heating creates a feedback loop. The dissipated power $P = V_{CE} I_C$ raises the device temperature by $\\Delta T = R_{\\mathrm{th}} P$. The device temperature becomes $T = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + \\Delta T$. However, the collector current $I_C = \\beta(T) I_B$ itself depends on this temperature. This leads to the self-consistent fixed-point equation:\n$$T = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{CE} I_B \\beta(T)$$\nThis equation must be solved for $T$. We employ a fixed-point iteration with a relaxation factor $\\lambda \\in (0, 1]$ to ensure stable convergence. Starting with an initial guess $T_k = T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, the iteration proceeds as follows:\n-   Calculate a new temperature estimate: $T_{\\mathrm{new}, k} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + R_{\\mathrm{th}} V_{CE} I_B \\beta(T_k)$. Note that $I_B = J_B \\times A$.\n-   Update the temperature for the next iteration: $T_{k+1} = (1 - \\lambda) T_k + \\lambda T_{\\mathrm{new}, k}$.\nThe iteration continues until the change in temperature between steps is negligible, i.e., $|T_{\\mathrm{new}, k} - T_k| < \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small tolerance (given as $1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$). Upon convergence to a final temperature $T_{\\mathrm{final}}$, the self-consistent heated gain, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{heated}}$, is calculated as $\\beta(T_{\\mathrm{final}})$.\n\nThe specified constants are $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$, and $T_0 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The algorithm is implemented for each provided test case to determine the pairs of $(\\beta_{\\mathrm{amb}}, \\beta_{\\mathrm{heated}})$ values.",
