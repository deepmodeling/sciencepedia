            "problem": "A uniformly doped one-dimensional base region of an $n$-$p$-$n$ bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has a neutral base width $W_{B}$ and acceptor doping $N_{A}$. Consider the base as $p$-type, with minority electrons of equilibrium concentration $n_{p0} = n_{i}^{2}/N_{A}$, where $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration. Assume low-level injection, steady state, and negligible electric field in the neutral base so that minority-carrier transport is diffusion dominated. The emitter-base (EB) junction at $x=0$ is forward biased by a voltage $V_{BE}  0$, while the base-collector (BC) junction at $x = W_{B}$ is reverse biased strongly enough that the excess minority electron concentration at the base-collector depletion edge is negligible. Let the electron diffusion coefficient in the base be $D_{n}$ and the minority electron lifetime be $\\tau_{n}$, so that the diffusion length is $L_{n} = \\sqrt{D_{n}\\tau_{n}}$. The thermal voltage is $V_{T} = k_{B}T/q$, where $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann’s constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $q$ is the elementary charge.\n\nStarting from the steady-state electron continuity equation in the base and the drift-diffusion form of the electron current density, derive the one-dimensional spatial profile of the excess minority electron concentration $\\Delta n(x)$ in the base, subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the EB and BC junctions.

Express the final answer for $Q_{B}'$ in coulombs per square meter (C m^{-2}).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the spatial profile of the excess minority electron concentration, $\\Delta n(x)$, in the neutral base of an $n$-$p$-$n$ BJT, the location of its maximum, and the total stored minority charge per unit area, $Q_{B}'$. The transistor is operating in the forward active mode.\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional, steady-state continuity equation for minority carriers (electrons) in the $p$-type base. In the absence of external generation sources (like light), this equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n_p}{\\partial t} = 0 = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dJ_n}{dx} - U_n $$\nwhere $n_p$ is the total electron concentration, $J_n$ is the electron current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $U_n$ is the net recombination rate. For low-level injection, the net recombination rate is proportional to the excess electron concentration, $\\Delta n(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$, where $n_{p0}$ is the equilibrium minority electron concentration. The recombination rate is given by $U_n = \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n}$, where $\\tau_n$ is the minority electron lifetime.\n\nThe problem states that the electric field in the neutral base is negligible. Therefore, the electron transport is dominated by diffusion. The electron current density is given by the diffusion equation:\n$$ J_n(x) = q D_n \\frac{dn_p(x)}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_n$ is the electron diffusion coefficient. Since $n_p(x) = \\Delta n(x) + n_{p0}$ and $n_{p0}$ is a constant, we have $\\frac{dn_p}{dx} = \\frac{d\\Delta n}{dx}$. Thus,\n$$ J_n(x) = q D_n \\frac{d\\Delta n(x)}{dx} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $U_n$ and $J_n$ into the continuity equation, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( q D_n \\frac{d\\Delta n(x)}{dx} \\right) - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n} = 0 $$\nAssuming the base is uniformly doped, $D_n$ is constant. The equation simplifies to the time-independent minority carrier diffusion equation:\n$$ D_n \\frac{d^2\\Delta n(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{\\tau_n} = 0 $$\nUsing the definition of the minority carrier diffusion length, $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$, this equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\Delta n(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x)}{L_n^2} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Its general solution has the form $\\Delta n(x) = A \\exp(x/L_n) + B \\exp(-x/L_n)$, or alternatively, in terms of hyperbolic functions, $\\Delta n(x) = C \\sinh(x/L_n) + D \\cosh(x/L_n)$.\n\nNext, we establish the boundary conditions for the neutral base region, which extends from $x=0$ to $x=W_B$.\n1.  At the emitter-base (EB) junction, $x=0$, the junction is forward biased by a voltage $V_{BE}$. According to the law of the junction for low-level injection, the minority carrier concentration at the edge of the depletion region is given by $n_p(0) = n_{p0} \\exp(V_{BE}/V_T)$. The excess concentration is therefore:\n    $$ \\Delta n(0) = n_p(0) - n_{p0} = n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\n2.  At the base-collector (BC) junction, $x=W_B$, the junction is strongly reverse biased. This bias sweeps minority carriers from the base into the collector, causing their concentration at the depletion region edge to drop to nearly zero. The problem states we can assume the excess concentration is negligible. Thus:\n    $$ \\Delta n(W_B) = 0 $$\n\nTo find the specific solution for $\\Delta n(x)$, we apply these boundary conditions to the general solution. It is convenient to use a form of the general solution that simplifies the application of the second boundary condition. Let us consider a linear combination of hyperbolic functions shifted in such a way that one term vanishes at $x=W_B$. A suitable form is $\\Delta n(x) = A' \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right) + B' \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right)$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=W_B$:\n$$ \\Delta n(W_B) = A' \\sinh(0) + B' \\cosh(0) = B' = 0 $$\nThis simplifies the solution to $\\Delta n(x) = A' \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n}\\right)$.\nNow, we apply the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\Delta n(0) = A' \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) = n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nSolving for the constant $A'$:\n$$ A' = \\frac{n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)} $$\nSubstituting $A'$ back into the solution, we obtain the spatial profile of the excess minority electron concentration in the base:\n$$ \\Delta n(x) = n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B - x}{L_n}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)} $$\n\nTo find where the excess minority electron concentration attains its maximum, we analyze the function $\\Delta n(x)$ on the interval $x \\in [0, W_B]$. The term $n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$ is positive since $V_{BE}  0$. The denominator $\\sinh(W_B/L_n)$ is also positive. The argument of the numerator's hyperbolic sine function, $(W_B - x)/L_n$, is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$. Since $\\sinh(u)$ is a monotonically increasing function for any real $u$, the entire expression for $\\Delta n(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$ on the interval $[0, W_B]$. Consequently, the maximum concentration occurs at the leftmost point of the interval, which is $x=0$.\nThis result is physically intuitive: electrons are injected into the base at the EB junction ($x=0$), establishing a high concentration there. As they diffuse towards the collector ($x=W_B$), some are lost to recombination, and those that reach the collector junction are swept away by the reverse bias. The concentration thus decreases continuously from the emitter side to the collector side. The maximum concentration is determined by the forward bias at the EB boundary, $\\Delta n_{max} = \\Delta n(0)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total stored minority charge per unit area, $Q_{B}'$, by integrating $\\Delta n(x)$ over the neutral base width:\n$$ Q_{B}' = q \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} \\Delta n(x)\\, dx $$\n$$ Q_{B}' = q \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B - x}{L_n}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)} \\,dx $$\nThe terms outside the integral are constant with respect to $x$. Let's focus on the integral part:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{W_{B}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B - x}{L_n}\\right) \\,dx $$\nLet $u = \\frac{W_B - x}{L_n}$. Then $du = -\\frac{1}{L_n} dx$, which means $dx = -L_n du$. The limits of integration change from $x=0$ to $u=W_B/L_n$ and from $x=W_B$ to $u=0$.\n$$ \\int_{W_B/L_n}^{0} \\sinh(u) (-L_n du) = L_n \\int_{0}^{W_B/L_n} \\sinh(u) \\,du $$\nThe integral of $\\sinh(u)$ is $\\cosh(u)$:\n$$ L_n \\left[ \\cosh(u) \\right]_{0}^{W_B/L_n} = L_n \\left[ \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) - \\cosh(0) \\right] = L_n \\left( \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $Q_{B}'$:\n$$ Q_{B}' = q \\cdot n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\frac{1}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)} \\cdot L_n \\left( \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\n$$ Q_{B}' = q L_n n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right) - 1}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n}\\right)} $$\nThis expression can be simplified using the hyperbolic half-angle identity $\\tanh(z/2) = \\frac{\\cosh(z) - 1}{\\sinh(z)}$. Setting $z = W_B/L_n$, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the stored charge per unit area:\n$$ Q_{B}' = q L_n n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\tanh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{2L_n}\\right) $$\nThis expression is in terms of the specified quantities $n_{p0}$, $V_{BE}$, $V_{T}$, $W_{B}$, $L_{n}$, and $q$, and has the correct units of C m$^{-2}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Early voltage, $V_{A}$, for a vertical n-p-n bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and the calculation of its sensitivity to collector doping concentration. The solution will be developed from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nFirst, we address the relationship between the collector current, $I_{C}$, and the neutral base width, $W_{B}$, using the charge-control model. In the forward-active region of operation with a fixed base-emitter voltage $V_{BE}$, the collector current is primarily due to the diffusion of minority carriers (electrons) across the p-type base. For a narrow base transistor, the electron concentration profile, $n_{p}(x)$, is approximately linear across the neutral base region, which extends from $x=0$ to $x=W_{B}$. The collector current density, $J_{C}$, is given by:\n$$J_{C} = q D_{n} \\frac{dn_{p}}{dx} \\approx q D_{n} \\frac{n_{p}(0) - n_{p}(W_{B})}{W_{B}}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion coefficient in the base, $n_{p}(0)$ is the minority carrier concentration at the edge of the emitter-base depletion region, and $n_{p}(W_{B})$ is the concentration at the edge of the collector-base depletion region.\nWith a fixed forward bias $V_{BE}$, the law of the junction gives $n_{p}(0) = \\frac{n_{i}^2}{N_{B}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$, where $n_{i}$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration and $N_{B}$ is the base doping. Since the collector-base junction is reverse-biased ($V_{CB}  0$), we can approximate $n_{p}(W_{B}) \\approx 0$.\nThe collector current $I_{C}$ is $A_{E}J_{C}$, where $A_{E}$ is the emitter area. Thus,\n$$I_{C} \\approx \\frac{A_{E} q D_{n} n_{i}^2}{N_{B}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{BE}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\frac{1}{W_{B}}$$\nSince $V_{BE}$ is held fixed, all terms in the expression are constant except for $W_{B}$. Therefore, the collector current is inversely proportional to the neutral base width:\n$$I_{C} \\propto \\frac{1}{W_{B}}$$\n\nNext, we relate the neutral base width $W_{B}$ to the collector-base voltage $V_{CB}$ using depletion region electrostatics. The metallurgical base width is modulated by the depletion region of the collector-base junction. The neutral base width is $W_{B}(V_{CB}) = W_{B,meta} - x_{pE} - x_{pC}(V_{CB})$, where $W_{B,meta}$ is the metallurgical width, $x_{pE}$ is the depletion width into the base from the emitter-base junction, and $x_{pC}$ is the depletion width into the base from the collector-base junction. The problem states we should consider modulation only from the collector-base junction, so we can write $W_{B}(V_{CB}) = W_{B0} - x_{pC}(V_{CB})$, where $W_{B0}$ is a constant representing the base width portion not affected by $V_{CB}$.\n\nFor an abrupt p-n junction under the depletion approximation, the total depletion width, $x_{d}$, across the collector-base junction is:\n$$x_{d} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_{B}} + \\frac{1}{N_{C}}\\right)(V_{bi} + V_{CB})}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{s}$ is the semiconductor permittivity, $V_{bi}$ is the built-in potential, $N_{B}$ is the acceptor density in the base, and $N_{C}$ is the donor density in the collector.\nThe condition of charge neutrality in the depletion region, $|Q_{p}| = |Q_{n}|$, implies $q A N_{B} x_{pC} = q A N_{C} x_{nC}$, where $x_{pC}$ and $x_{nC}$ are the depletion widths on the p-side (base) and n-side (collector) respectively. With $x_{d} = x_{pC} + x_{nC}$, we can solve for $x_{pC}$:\n$$x_{pC} = x_{d} \\frac{N_{C}}{N_{B} + N_{C}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_{d}$:\n$$x_{pC} = \\left(\\frac{N_{C}}{N_{B} + N_{C}}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{s}}{q} \\frac{N_{B} + N_{C}}{N_{B}N_{C}}(V_{bi} + V_{CB})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{s} N_{C} (V_{bi} + V_{CB})}{q N_{B} (N_{B} + N_{C})}}$$\n\nNow we derive the Early voltage, $V_{A}$. It is defined from the output conductance $g_{o} = \\frac{dI_{C}}{dV_{CE}}|_{V_{BE}=const}$, which is approximately $\\frac{I_{C}}{V_{A}}$. For constant $V_{BE}$, $dV_{CE} \\approx dV_{CB}$, so we use the definition $V_{A} = I_{C} / \\frac{dI_{C}}{dV_{CB}}$.\nFrom $I_{C} \\propto 1/W_{B}$, we have $\\ln(I_{C}) = \\text{const} - \\ln(W_{B})$. Differentiating with respect to $V_{CB}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{I_{C}}\\frac{dI_{C}}{dV_{CB}} = -\\frac{1}{W_{B}}\\frac{dW_{B}}{dV_{CB}}$$\nThus, $V_{A} = -W_{B} / \\frac{dW_{B}}{dV_{CB}}$. Since $W_{B} = W_{B0} - x_{pC}(V_{CB})$, we have $\\frac{dW_{B}}{dV_{CB}} = -\\frac{dx_{pC}}{dV_{CB}}$. This yields:\n$$V_{A} = W_{B} \\left/ \\frac{dx_{pC}}{dV_{CB}}\\right.$$\nWe calculate the derivative of $x_{pC}$ with respect to $V_{CB}$:\n$$\\frac{dx_{pC}}{dV_{CB}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{CB}} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{s} N_{C}}{q N_{B} (N_{B} + N_{C})}} \\sqrt{V_{bi} + V_{CB}} \\right] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{s} N_{C}}{q N_{B} (N_{B} + N_{C})}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{V_{bi} + V_{CB}}}$$\n$$ \\frac{dx_{pC}}{dV_{CB}} = \\frac{x_{pC}}{2(V_{bi} + V_{CB})}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $V_{A}$:\n$$V_{A} = W_{B} \\left/ \\left(\\frac{x_{pC}}{2(V_{bi} + V_{CB})}\\right) \\right. = \\frac{2 W_{B} (V_{bi} + V_{CB})}{x_{pC}}$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $x_{pC}$ gives the scaling of $V_{A}$ (Task 1):\n$$V_{A} = \\frac{2 W_{B} (V_{bi} + V_{CB})}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{s} N_{C} (V_{bi} + V_{CB})}{q N_{B} (N_{B} + N_{C})}}} = W_{B} \\sqrt{\\frac{4(V_{bi}+V_{CB})^2 q N_B(N_B+N_C)}{2\\epsilon_s N_C(V_{bi}+V_{CB})}}$$\n$$V_{A} = W_{B} \\sqrt{\\frac{2q(V_{bi} + V_{CB})}{\\epsilon_{s}} \\frac{N_{B}(N_{B} + N_{C})}{N_{C}}}$$\n\nFor Task 2, we compute the logarithmic sensitivity $S \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln V_{A}}{d \\ln N_{C}}$ at fixed $W_{B}$, $N_{B}$, $\\epsilon_{s}$, and $V_{bi}+V_{CB}$. The problem specifies to treat $V_{bi}$ (and thus $V_{bi}+V_{CB}$) as independent of $N_{C}$ for this calculation.\nLet's first express $\\ln V_{A}$:\n$$\\ln V_{A} = \\ln\\left(W_{B} \\sqrt{\\frac{2q(V_{bi} + V_{CB})N_{B}}{\\epsilon_{s}}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{B} + N_{C}}{N_{C}}\\right)$$\nThe first term is constant under the given conditions. Let's call it $C$.\n$$\\ln V_{A} = C + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{N_{B}}{N_{C}}\\right)$$\nThe sensitivity $S$ is computed using the chain rule: $S = \\frac{d(\\ln V_{A})}{d N_{C}} \\frac{dN_{C}}{d(\\ln N_{C})} = N_{C} \\frac{d(\\ln V_{A})}{d N_{C}}$.\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln V_{A})}{d N_{C}} = \\frac{d}{d N_{C}} \\left[C + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{N_{B}}{N_{C}}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{1 + N_{B}/N_{C}} \\left(-\\frac{N_{B}}{N_{C}^{2}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln V_{A})}{d N_{C}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{N_{C}}{N_{C} + N_{B}} \\left(-\\frac{N_{B}}{N_{C}^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{N_{B}}{2N_{C}(N_{B} + N_{C})}$$\nNow, we find $S$:\n$$S = N_{C} \\left( -\\frac{N_{B}}{2N_{C}(N_{B} + N_{C})} \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{N_{B}}{N_{B} + N_{C}}$$\nWe are asked to compute $S$ in the one-sided limit typical of vertical transistors, where $N_{B} \\gg N_{C}$. In this limit, the denominator $N_{B} + N_{C}$ approaches $N_{B}$:\n$$S = \\lim_{N_{B}/N_{C} \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{N_{B}}{N_{B} + N_{C}}\\right) = \\lim_{N_{B}/N_{C} \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{1 + N_{C}/N_{B}}\\right)$$\nAs $N_{C}/N_{B} \\to 0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$S = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = -\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe final sensitivity is a dimensionless number, as required.",
