Under the stated assumption of negligible electric field in the quasi-neutral base, the transport is dominated by diffusion. The continuity equation, which balances generation and recombination with the divergence of the diffusion current, is:\n$$ \\frac{d J_n(x)}{dx} - q R(x) = 0 $$\nwhere $J_n(x)$ is the electron current density and $R(x)$ is the net recombination rate. The electron current density due to diffusion is given by Fick's first law:\n$$ J_n(x) = q D_n(T) \\frac{d n_p(x,T)}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_n(T)$ is the electron diffusion coefficient and $n_p(x,T)$ is the total electron concentration. The net recombination rate under low-level injection is given by:\n$$ R(x) = \\frac{n_p(x,T) - n_{0B}(T)}{\\tau_n(T)} $$\nwhere $n_{0B}(T)$ is the equilibrium minority electron concentration and $\\tau_n(T)$ is the minority electron lifetime. Substituting these into the continuity equation gives:\n$$ q D_n(T) \\frac{d^2 n_p(x,T)}{dx^2} - q \\frac{n_p(x,T) - n_{0B}(T)}{\\tau_n(T)} = 0 $$\nWe define the excess minority electron concentration as $\\Delta n(x,T) = n_p(x,T) - n_{0B}(T)$. Since $n_{0B}(T)$ is constant with respect to position $x$, we have $\\frac{d n_p}{dx} = \\frac{d \\Delta n}{dx}$ and $\\frac{d^2 n_p}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n}{dx^2}$. The equation can be rewritten in terms of the excess concentration:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n(x,T)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x,T)}{D_n(T) \\tau_n(T)} = 0 $$\nDefining the minority electron diffusion length as $L_n(T) = \\sqrt{D_n(T) \\tau_n(T)}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\Delta n(x,T)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Delta n(x,T)}{L_n(T)^2} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Its general solution can be written as:\n$$ \\Delta n(x,T) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_n(T)}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_n(T)}\\right) $$\nTo find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we apply the boundary conditions provided in the problem statement. The base region extends from $x=0$ (emitter–base junction edge) to $x=W_B$ (collector–base junction edge).\n\nBoundary Condition 1 (at $x=0$):\nThe emitter–base junction is forward biased by $V_{BE}$, leading to an excess carrier concentration given by the law of the junction:\n$$ \\Delta n(0,T) = n_{0B}(T)\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_{BE}}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right] $$\nApplying this to the general solution gives:\n$$ \\Delta n(0,T) = C_1 + C_2 $$\n\nBoundary Condition 2 (at $x=W_B$):\nThe collector–base junction is strongly reverse biased, which causes the excess carrier concentration at this edge to be approximately zero:\n$$ \\Delta n(W_B,T) = 0 $$\nApplying this to the general solution gives:\n$$ 0 = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) $$\nFrom this second equation, we can express $C_1$ in terms of $C_2$:\n$$ C_1 = -C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the equation from the first boundary condition:\n$$ \\Delta n(0,T) = -C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) + C_2 = C_2 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)\\right) $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T) \\exp\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)}{2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} $$\nAnd for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = - \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} = - \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)}{2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $\\Delta n(x,T)$:\n$$ \\Delta n(x,T) = \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T)}{2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} \\left[ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_n(T)}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_n(T)}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta n(x,T) = \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T)}{2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n(T)}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_B-x}{L_n(T)}\\right) \\right] $$\nRecognizing the definition of the hyperbolic sine function, we arrive at the final expression for the excess minority electron concentration profile, which completes Task 1:\n$$ \\Delta n(x,T) = \\Delta n(0,T) \\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B - x}{L_n(T)}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} $$\n\nNext, for Task 2, we derive the expression for the total stored excess base charge, $Q_B(T)$. It is defined as the integral of the excess charge density over the volume of the quasi-neutral base:\n$$ Q_B(T) = q A \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\Delta n(x,T) \\, dx $$\nSubstituting the derived profile for $\\Delta n(x,T)$:\n$$ Q_B(T) = q A \\frac{\\Delta n(0,T)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B - x}{L_n(T)}\\right) \\, dx $$\nTo solve the integral, let $u = \\frac{W_B - x}{L_n(T)}$, which implies $dx = -L_n(T) du$. The limits of integration change from $x=0$ to $u=\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}$ and from $x=W_B$ to $u=0$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{W_B} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B - x}{L_n(T)}\\right) \\, dx = \\int_{\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}}^{0} \\sinh(u) (-L_n(T) \\, du) = L_n(T) \\int_{0}^{\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}} \\sinh(u) \\, du $$\n$$ = L_n(T) \\left[ \\cosh(u) \\right]_{0}^{\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}} = L_n(T) \\left( \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) - \\cosh(0) \\right) = L_n(T) \\left( \\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $Q_B(T)$:\n$$ Q_B(T) = q A \\Delta n(0,T) L_n(T) \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right) - 1}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{L_n(T)}\\right)} $$\nUsing the half-angle identity for hyperbolic tangent, $\\tanh(z/2) = \\frac{\\cosh(z)-1}{\\sinh(z)}$, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the stored base charge:\n$$ Q_B(T) = q A \\Delta n(0,T) L_n(T) \\tanh\\left(\\frac{W_B}{2 L_n(T)}\\right) $$\n\nFor Task 3, we evaluate $Q_B(T)$ at $T_1 = 300 \\, \\text{K}$ and $T_2 = 350 \\, \\text{K}$.\n\n**Calculation at $T_1 = 300 \\, \\text{K}$:**\n1.

Thus,\n$$ C_{\\text{diff}}(T) \\approx \\frac{q}{k_B T} Q_B(T) = \\frac{Q_B(T)}{V_T} $$\nWe calculated that $Q_B(T)$ decreases from $1.596 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{C}$ at $T_1=300 \\, \\text{K}$ to $9.062 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{C}$ at $T_2=350 \\, \\text{K}$. Concurrently, the thermal voltage $V_T = T / (q/k_B)$ increases with temperature. Both factors—the decrease in $Q_B(T)$ and the increase in the denominator $T$—contribute to a reduction in the diffusion capacitance. The dependence of $\\Delta n(0,T)$ on temperature, which involves the competition between the strong increase in $n_i(T)^2$ and the exponential decrease in $\\exp(qV_{BE}/k_B T)$, is the primary driver. For a fixed $V_{BE}$, the exponential term's decrease is dominant, leading to smaller $Q_B$ and consequently a smaller $C_{\\text{diff}}$ at higher temperatures.\n\nThe numerical values rounded to four significant figures are $Q_B(T_1) = 1.596 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{C}$ and $Q_B(T_2) = 9.062 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{C}$.",
