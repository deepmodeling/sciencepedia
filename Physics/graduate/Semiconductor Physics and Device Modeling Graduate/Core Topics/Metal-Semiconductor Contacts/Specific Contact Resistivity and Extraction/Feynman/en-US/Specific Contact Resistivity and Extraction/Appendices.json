This process, known as current crowding, is not uniform; current prefers to enter the semiconductor near the contact edge. This exercise  guides you through the derivation of the one-dimensional Transmission Line Model (TLM), the foundational theory for this phenomenon.

The metal contact is assumed to be an ideal equipotential at voltage $V_{m}$, and the semiconductor sheet under the contact has a local electrostatic potential $V(x)$ that varies with $x$ due to lateral transport and vertical current injection. The contact obeys linear ohmic behavior characterized by the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_{c}$, defined by the local vertical current density $J_{v}(x)$ satisfying $J_{v}(x) = \\left(V_{m} - V(x)\\right)/\\rho_{c}$.

The concepts of sheet resistance, specific contact resistivity, and the associated differential equations are well-established and scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides the necessary physical relationships to derive a governing differential equation. The boundary condition at infinity ($x \\to \\infty$) is physically motivated and sufficient to determine the functional form of the solution relevant to the question. The quantity to be calculated, $F(L)$, is a ratio where any unknown pre-factors related to the unspecified boundary condition at $x=0$ are expected to cancel, leading to a unique, well-defined solution.\n*   **Objectivity & Clarity**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from solid-state physics. There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n*   **Consistency**: The physical units of the provided equations are consistent.\n    *   From the definition of $i(x)$, the units of sheet resistance $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ are Ohms ($\\Omega$), assuming $i(x)$ is in A/m. This is unusual, as $R_{sh}$ is typically given in $\\Omega/sq$. Let's analyze the continuity equation: $\\mathrm{d}i/\\mathrm{d}x + J_v(x) = 0$. The units are $(\\text{A}/\\text{m})/\\text{m} + \\text{A}/\\text{m}^2 = \\text{A}/\\text{m}^2$. This means the continuity equation relates the divergence of the current-per-width to the area current density. This is physically consistent. $J_v(x) = (V_m - V(x))/\\rho_c$ works if $\\rho_c$ is in $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^2$. If $i(x) = -(1/R_{sh}) dV/dx$, then its units are $[\\text{V}]/([\\Omega][\\text{m}])$, which are not A/m. The standard definition is that the lateral current is $I(x) = - (W/R_{sh}) dV/dx$, where $R_{sh}$ is in $\\Omega/sq$. So the current per unit width is $i(x) = I(x)/W = -(1/R_{sh}) dV/dx$. Thus, the units of $R_{sh}$ in this formulation must be $\\Omega \\cdot$ square, which is just $\\Omega$. The problem is dimensionally consistent under the standard interpretation of the TLM.\n*   **Conclusion**: There are no scientific flaws, inconsistencies, or ambiguities. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in four steps: 1) derive the governing differential equation for the potential $V(x)$; 2) solve this equation subject to the given boundary condition; 3) determine the vertical current distribution $j(x)$ and formulate the fraction $F(L)$; and 4) evaluate this fraction at the characteristic transfer length.\n\n**1. Derive the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nWe are given three fundamental relations:\n1.  The per-unit-width lateral current in the sheet: $i(x) = -\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x}$\n2.  The vertical current density injected from the contact: $J_{v}(x) = \\frac{V_{m} - V(x)}{\\rho_{c}}$\n3.  The continuity equation, which ensures conservation of current: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}x} + J_{v}(x) = 0$\n\nTo find the differential equation for $V(x)$, we first differentiate the expression for $i(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(-\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this and the expression for $J_v(x)$ into the continuity equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} + \\frac{V_{m} - V(x)}{\\rho_{c}} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{\\rho_{c}}(V(x) - V_m) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation for $V(x)$. Let's define the characteristic transfer length, $L_T$, as:\n$$\nL_T \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{c}}{R_{\\mathrm{sh}}}}\n$$\nThe differential equation can then be written in its standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2}(V(x) - V_m) = 0\n$$\n\n**2. Solve the Differential Equation**\n\nTo solve this equation, we introduce a new variable $U(x) = V(x) - V_m$. The differential equation for $U(x)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2U}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2}U(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n$$\nU(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. Substituting back for $V(x)$, we get:\n$$\nV(x) = V_m + A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nWe apply the boundary condition that $V(x) \\to V_m$ as $x \\to \\infty$. As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/L_T)$ diverges. For the solution to remain finite and approach $V_m$, the coefficient $A$ must be zero. Thus, $A=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$\nV(x) = V_m + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe constant $B$ is determined by the condition at $x=0$, i.e., $B = V(0) - V_m$. While $V(0)$ is unknown, we will see that it cancels out in the final calculation.\n\n**3. Determine the Current Distribution and the Fraction F(L)**\n\nThe problem defines $j(x)$ as the \"vertical current injection per unit width\". In the context of the 1D TLM, the current injected into the semiconductor per unit length along $x$ and per unit width is precisely the vertical current density $J_v(x)$. Therefore, we identify $j(x) = J_v(x)$.\n$$\nj(x) = J_v(x) = \\frac{V_m - V(x)}{\\rho_c}\n$$\nUsing our solution for $V(x)$:\n$$\nV_m - V(x) = -B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nSo, the distribution of injected current is:\n$$\nj(x) = -\\frac{B}{\\rho_c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nLet's define a constant $j_0 = -B/\\rho_c = (V_m - V(0))/\\rho_c$. This gives:\n$$\nj(x) = j_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nNow we can compute the fraction $F(L)$:\n$$\nF(L) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{L} j(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} j(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{L} j_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} j_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\nThe constant $j_0$ cancels out. We evaluate the integrals:\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[-L_T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{L} = -L_T \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{L_T}\\right) - \\exp(0)\\right) = L_T \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{L_T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[-L_T \\exp\\left(-\\fracx}{L_T}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = -L_T (0 - 1) = L_T\n$$\nThus, the fraction $F(L)$ is:\n$$\nF(L) = \\frac{L_T \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{L_T}\\right)\\right)}{L_T} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\n\n**4. Evaluate F(L) at the Characteristic Transfer Length**\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of $F(L)$ at $L$ equal to the characteristic transfer length, i.e., at $L = L_T$.\n$$\nF(L_T) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L_T}{L_T}\\right) = 1 - \\exp(-1) = 1 - \\frac{1}{e}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value. Using the value of Euler's number $e \\approx 2.71828$:\n$$\nF(L_T) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2.71828} \\approx 1 - 0.36787944 \\approx 0.63212056\n$$\nRounding this result to $5$ significant figures gives $0.63212$.",

This will be accomplished by first performing a linear regression on the provided data, deriving the governing physical relations from first principles, and finally solving the resulting implicit equation numerically.\n\nThe total resistance $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ of a TLM structure is modeled as the sum of the resistance of the semiconductor sheet between the contacts and the resistance of the two contacts themselves. The resistance of the sheet, with sheet resistance $R_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ (in $\\Omega/\\square$), width $W$, and length $L$, is given by $R_{\\mathrm{sheet}} = (R_{\\mathrm{sh}} L)/W$. The total resistance from the two identical contacts is $2R_c$, where $R_c$ is the resistance of a single contact.

            "solution": "The problem requires the extraction of the activation energy, $E_{a}$, associated with the specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_{c}$, of a metal-semiconductor contact. The analysis is to be based on the temperature dependence of $\\rho_{c}$ derived from the thermionic emission model of a Schottky contact. This task involves a theoretical derivation followed by a numerical implementation using linear regression.\n\nFirst, we must derive an analytical expression for the specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_{c}(T)$, as a function of temperature, $T$. The current density-voltage, $J(V,T)$, characteristic under thermionic emission is given as:\n$$J(T,V) = A^{\\ast} T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{q V}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right]$$\nwhere $A^{\\ast}$ is the effective Richardson constant, $E_{B}$ is the Schottky barrier energy, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $q$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe specific contact resistivity is defined as the inverse of the zero-bias conductance per unit area:\n$$\\rho_{c}(T) = \\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V}\\right|_{V=0}\\right)^{-1}$$\nTo find $\\rho_{c}(T)$, we first compute the derivative of $J(T,V)$ with respect to the applied voltage $V$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V} \\left\\{ A^{\\ast} T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{q V}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right] \\right\\} $$\nThe term preceding the brackets is independent of $V$. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V} = A^{\\ast} T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{q V}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V} = A^{\\ast} T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{q}{k_{B} T} \\right] $$\nWe now evaluate this derivative at zero bias, $V=0$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V}\\right|_{V=0} = A^{\\ast} T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\left[ \\exp(0) \\cdot \\frac{q}{k_{B} T} \\right] = A^{\\ast} T^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\frac{q}{k_{B} T} $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the zero-bias conductance per unit area:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V}\\right|_{V=0} = \\frac{q A^{\\ast} T}{k_{B}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\nThe specific contact resistivity is the reciprocal of this quantity:\n$$ \\rho_{c}(T) = \\left( \\frac{q A^{\\ast} T}{k_{B}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast} T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we perform the activation analysis as specified. We are instructed to analyze the temperature dependence of the quantity $\\rho_{c}(T) T$. Using our derived expression for $\\rho_{c}(T)$:\n$$ \\rho_{c}(T) T = \\left( \\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast} T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right) T = \\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\nA thermally activated process follows an Arrhenius law of the form $X(T) = C \\exp(E_{a}/(k_{B}T))$. To extract the activation energy $E_a$, one typically plots $\\ln(X)$ versus $1/T$. The slope of this plot is $E_{a}/k_{B}$.\nLet us take the natural logarithm of our quantity of interest, $\\rho_{c}(T) T$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\rho_{c}(T) T\\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\rho_{c}(T) T\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast}}\\right) + \\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = S x + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln\\left(\\rho_{c}(T) T\\right)$.\n- The independent variable is $x = 1/T$.\n- The slope is $S = E_{B}/k_{B}$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\ln(k_{B}/(qA^{\\ast}))$.\n\nThe problem defines the activation energy $E_{a}$ via the slope $S$ of the linear fit as $E_{a} = S k_{B}$. Substituting our derived slope, we find:\n$$ E_{a} = \\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B}}\\right) k_{B} = E_{B} $$\nThus, the activation energy $E_{a}$ extracted from this analysis is theoretically identical to the Schottky barrier energy $E_{B}$. The task is to numerically verify this relationship for the given test cases.\n\nThe numerical procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  For a given barrier energy in electronvolts, $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{eV}}$, convert it to Joules using $E_{B} = E_{B}^{\\mathrm{eV}} \\cdot q$.\n2.  Using the provided set of temperatures $T \\in \\{250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375\\}\\ \\mathrm{K}$, construct an array of independent variable values, $x_{i} = 1/T_{i}$.\n3.  For each temperature $T_{i}$, calculate the corresponding theoretical value of $\\rho_{c}(T_{i}) T_{i} = \\frac{k_{B}}{q A^{\\ast}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{B}}{k_{B} T_{i}}\\right)$.\n4.  Construct the array of dependent variable values, $y_{i} = \\ln(\\rho_{c}(T_{i}) T_{i})$.\n5.  Perform an ordinary least squares linear regression on the data points $(x_{i}, y_{i})$ to determine the slope $S$.\n6.  Calculate the activation energy in electronvolts, $E_{a}^{\\mathrm{eV}} = (S \\cdot k_{B}) / q$.\n7.  The result should be numerically equal to the input $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{eV}}$, up to floating-point precision. The final value must be rounded to four decimal places.\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the four barrier energies provided. For the special case where $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{eV}} = 0.00$, the quantity $\\rho_{c}(T)T$ becomes independent of temperature, leading to a perfectly horizontal line for $\\ln(\\rho_{c}T)$ vs $1/T$. The slope $S$ will be zero, correctly yielding an activation energy of $E_{a}^{\\mathrm{eV}} = 0.0000\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.",
