This exercise guides you through the rigorous analytical derivation of the total resistance of a Circular Transmission Line Model (CTLM) structure, a common test pattern that avoids the current crowding issues found at the corners of rectangular contacts. By solving the governing differential equations for potential and current flow under the contacts and in the gap between them, you will develop a deep understanding of how parameters like sheet resistance ($R_{sh}$) and specific contact resistivity ($\\rho_c$) combine to determine the overall device behavior.

            "problem": "A circular Transmission Line Model (CTLM) structure is fabricated on a uniformly doped semiconductor layer that can be modeled as a two-dimensional resistive sheet with sheet resistance $R_{sh}$ (ohms per square). The CTLM consists of an inner circular ohmic contact of radius $a$ biased to metal potential $V_{0}$ and an outer annular ohmic contact whose inner edge is at radius $b$ and whose metal potential is set to $0$. The contact widths are assumed to be much larger than any characteristic decay length of the in-sheet potential under the metal, so that the metal potential is well enforced away from the edges. The gap region $arb$ is free of any vertical current flow. Under each metal, the interface is characterized by a uniform specific contact resistivity $\\rho_{c}$ (ohm-square-meters), equivalently a uniform interfacial conductance per unit area $g_{c}=1/\\rho_{c}$. Assume steady state, isotropic, linear transport, and negligible three-dimensional spreading beyond the two-dimensional sheet model. Cylindrical symmetry about the origin holds.\n\nStarting from the definitions of sheet conduction and current continuity in polar coordinates, and without invoking any pre-derived CTLM formulas, derive the closed-form expression for the total two-terminal resistance $R_{\\text{CTLM}}=V_{0}/I$ (in ohms), where $I$ is the total current flowing from the inner contact to the outer contact through the sheet. Your derivation must begin from the relations that, in the sheet, the radial current crossing a circumference of radius $r$ is $i_{r}(r)=-\\frac{2\\pi r}{R_{sh}}\\frac{dV}{dr}$, and that under a metal, the vertical current per unit area into the metal is $j_{z}(r)=g_{c}\\left(V_{m}-V(r)\\right)$, where $V_{m}$ is the metal potential ($V_{m}=V_{0}$ for $ra$ and $V_{m}=0$ for $rb$). Enforce current continuity $\\frac{d i_{r}}{dr}+2\\pi r\\,j_{z}(r)=0$ under the metals and $\\frac{d i_{r}}{dr}=0$ in the gap.

No numerical evaluation or approximation is permitted; provide the exact analytic expression. The resistance must be expressed in ohms.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in semiconductor device physics. It requires the derivation of the total resistance of a Circular Transmission Line Model (CTLM) structure from first principles.\n\nThe problem is analyzed by dividing the structure into three regions based on the radial coordinate $r$:\n1.  Region 1: The inner circular contact, for $0 \\le r \\le a$.\n2.  Region 2: The gap between the contacts, for $a \\le r \\le b$.\n3.  Region 3: The outer annular contact, for $r \\ge b$.\n\nWe will formulate and solve the differential equation for the potential $V(r)$ in the semiconductor sheet for each region and then apply boundary and interface conditions to determine the constants of integration. The total resistance $R_{\\text{CTLM}}$ will then be found from the ratio of the applied potential difference $V_0$ to the total current $I$.\n\nThe fundamental differential equation is derived from the provided relations for current. The radial current is $i_r(r) = -\\frac{2\\pi r}{R_{sh}} \\frac{dV}{dr}$, and the current continuity equation is $\\frac{di_r}{dr} + 2\\pi r j_z(r) = 0$. Substituting the first into the second gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi r}{R_{sh}} \\frac{dV}{dr}\\right) + 2\\pi r j_z(r) = 0\n$$\nAssuming $R_{sh}$ is uniform, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dV}{dr}\\right) - R_{sh} j_z(r) = 0\n$$\nThe vertical current density into the metal is $j_z(r) = g_c(V_m - V(r))$, where $g_c = 1/\\rho_c$. We define the transfer length $L_t = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_{sh}} = \\sqrt{1/(g_c R_{sh})}$.\n\n**Region 2: Gap region ($a \\le r \\le b$)**\nIn the gap, there is no metal contact, so there is no vertical current flow, $j_z(r) = 0$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dV_2}{dr}\\right) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating once gives $r \\frac{dV_2}{dr} = C_2$, and integrating a second time yields the potential profile in the gap:\n$$\nV_2(r) = C_2 \\ln(r) + D_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ and $D_2$ are constants. The total current $I$ flowing from the inner to the outer contact is constant throughout this region. This current is given by:\n$$\nI = i_r(r) = -\\frac{2\\pi r}{R_{sh}} \\frac{dV_2}{dr} = -\\frac{2\\pi r}{R_{sh}} \\frac{C_2}{r} = -\\frac{2\\pi C_2}{R_{sh}}\n$$\nThus, the constant $C_2$ is directly related to the total current: $C_2 = - \\frac{I R_{sh}}{2\\pi}$.\n\n**Region 1: Inner contact region ($0 \\le r \\le a$)**\nUnder the inner contact, the metal potential is $V_m = V_0$. The vertical current density is $j_z(r) = g_c(V_0 - V_1(r))$. The differential equation for the potential $V_1(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dV_1}{dr}\\right) - R_{sh} g_c (V_0 - V_1(r)) = 0\n$$\nLet $u(r) = V_1(r) - V_0$. The equation becomes $\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}(r \\frac{du}{dr}) + R_{sh} g_c u(r) = 0$. Using the transfer length definition $L_t^2 = 1/(R_{sh} g_c)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{1}{L_t^2} u = 0\n$$\nThis is the modified Bessel equation of order zero. The general solution for $u(r)$ is $u(r) = A_1 I_0(r/L_t) + B_1 K_0(r/L_t)$, where $I_0$ and $K_0$ are the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively. The potential is:\n$$\nV_1(r) = V_0 + A_1 I_0(r/L_t) + B_1 K_0(r/L_t)\n$$\nAt the center $r=0$, the potential must be finite. Since $K_0(r/L_t) \\to \\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, the constant $B_1$ must be zero. Thus:\n$$\nV_1(r) = V_0 + A_1 I_0(r/L_t)\n$$\n\n**Region 3: Outer contact region ($r \\ge b$)**\nUnder the outer contact, the metal potential is $V_m = 0$. The vertical current density is $j_z(r) = g_c(0 - V_3(r)) = -g_c V_3(r)$. The differential equation for the potential $V_3(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dV_3}{dr}\\right) + R_{sh} g_c V_3(r) = 0\n$$\nThis transforms into the same modified Bessel equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V_3}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{dV_3}{dr} - \\frac{1}{L_t^2} V_3(r) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $V_3(r) = A_3 I_0(r/L_t) + B_3 K_0(r/L_t)$. As $r \\to \\infty$, the potential in the sheet under the grounded contact must approach the metal potential, $V_3(r) \\to 0$. Since $I_0(r/L_t) \\to \\infty$ as $r \\to \\infty$, the constant $A_3$ must be zero. Thus:\n$$\nV_3(r) = B_3 K_0(r/L_t)\n$$\n\n**Application of Interface Conditions**\nWe connect the solutions by ensuring continuity of potential $V(r)$ and radial current $i_r(r)$ at the interfaces $r=a$ and $r=b$. Continuity of $i_r(r)$ is equivalent to continuity of $r \\frac{dV}{dr}$.\n\nAt the interface $r=a$:\n1.  Continuity of potential: $V_1(a) = V_2(a) \\implies V_0 + A_1 I_0(a/L_t) = C_2 \\ln(a) + D_2$.\n2.  Continuity of current: The total current $I$ entering the gap from the inner contact is equal to the current at the edge of the contact, $i_{r1}(a) = I$.\n    $$I = -\\frac{2\\pi a}{R_{sh}} \\left. \\frac{dV_1}{dr} \\right|_{r=a} = -\\frac{2\\pi a}{R_{sh}} \\left( \\frac{A_1}{L_t} I_1(a/L_t) \\right)$$\n    Solving for $A_1$ gives: $A_1 = -\\frac{I R_{sh} L_t}{2\\pi a I_1(a/L_t)}$.\n\nAt the interface $r=b$:\n1.  Continuity of potential: $V_2(b) = V_3(b) \\implies C_2 \\ln(b) + D_2 = B_3 K_0(b/L_t)$.\n2.  Continuity of current: The total current $I$ flowing from the gap into the outer contact equals $i_{r3}(b) = I$.\n    $$I = -\\frac{2\\pi b}{R_{sh}} \\left. \\frac{dV_3}{dr} \\right|_{r=b} = -\\frac{2\\pi b}{R_{sh}} \\left( -\\frac{B_3}{L_t} K_1(b/L_t) \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi b B_3}{R_{sh} L_t} K_1(b/L_t)$$\n    Solving for $B_3$ gives: $B_3 = \\frac{I R_{sh} L_t}{2\\pi b K_1(b/L_t)}$.\n\n**Derivation of the Total Resistance**\nWe have a system of two equations for the potential continuity:\n(i) $V_0 + A_1 I_0(a/L_t) = C_2 \\ln(a) + D_2$\n(ii) $C_2 \\ln(b) + D_2 = B_3 K_0(b/L_t)$\n\nLet's find $D_2$ from (i) and substitute into (ii): $D_2 = V_0 + A_1 I_0(a/L_t) - C_2 \\ln(a)$.\n$C_2 \\ln(b) + V_0 + A_1 I_0(a/L_t) - C_2 \\ln(a) = B_3 K_0(b/L_t)$.\nRearranging to solve for $V_0$:\n$$\nV_0 = - C_2 \\ln(b/a) - A_1 I_0(a/L_t) + B_3 K_0(b/L_t)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $C_2$, $A_1$, and $B_3$ in terms of the total current $I$:\n$C_2 = - \\frac{I R_{sh}}{2\\pi}$\n$A_1 = -\\frac{I R_{sh} L_t}{2\\pi a I_1(a/L_t)}$\n$B_3 = \\frac{I R_{sh} L_t}{2\\pi b K_1(b/L_t)}$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $V_0$:\n$$\nV_0 = - \\left(-\\frac{I R_{sh}}{2\\pi}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{I R_{sh} L_t}{2\\pi a I_1(a/L_t)}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{a}{L_t}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{I R_{sh} L_t}{2\\pi b K_1(b/L_t)}\\right) K_0\\left(\\frac{b}{L_t}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nV_0 = \\frac{I R_{sh}}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) + \\frac{I R_{sh}}{2\\pi} \\frac{L_t}{a} \\frac{I_0(a/L_t)}{I_1(a/L_t)} + \\frac{I R_{sh}}{2\\pi} \\frac{L_t}{b} \\frac{K_0(b/L_t)}{K_1(b/L_t)}\n$$\nThe total resistance is defined as $R_{\\text{CTLM}} = V_0 / I$. Dividing the above equation by $I$ gives the final expression:\n$$\nR_{\\text{CTLM}} = \\frac{V_0}{I} = \\frac{R_{sh}}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) + \\frac{L_t}{a} \\frac{I_0(a/L_t)}{I_1(a/L_t)} + \\frac{L_t}{b} \\frac{K_0(b/L_t)}{K_1(b/L_t)} \\right]\n$$\nThis expression represents the sum of three resistive contributions: the sheet resistance of the gap region, the contact resistance of the inner contact, and the contact resistance of the outer contact, all properly formulated for the circular geometry.",

The formula is:\n$$R = R_{\\text{sheet}} + 2R_c$$\nThe sheet resistance between the contacts is given by $R_{\\text{sheet}} = R_{\\text{sh}} \\frac{L}{W}$, where $R_{\\text{sh}}$ is the sheet resistance of the semiconductor layer, $L$ is the gap length, and $W$ is the contact width.

The classical solution to this problem relates the uniform temperature rise of the disk, $\\Delta T_{if} = T_{if} - T_0$, to the total heat power, $P$, flowing from the disk into the semi-infinite medium:\n$$P = 4 k_s a \\Delta T_{if}$$\nThis relationship defines the thermal spreading resistance, $R_{th,spread}$, of the isothermal disk:\n$$R_{th,spread} = \\frac{\\Delta T_{if}}{P} = \\frac{1}{4 k_s a}$$\nThe heat generation is due to a uniform power density, $q''$. The total power is this density multiplied by the contact area, $A_c = \\pi a^2$:\n$$P = q'' A_c = q'' (\\pi a^2)$$\nWe can now find the temperature rise of the silicon surface due to thermal spreading, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\Delta T_{if}$, by substituting the expression for $P$ into the resistance formula:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{spread}} = P \\cdot R_{th,spread} = (q'' \\pi a^2) \\left( \\frac{1}{4 k_s a} \\right) = q'' \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s}$$\nThe problem asks for this to be expressed as $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{spread}} = q'' S_{\\mathrm{spread}}$. By comparing the two forms, we identify the thermal spreading factor $S_{\\mathrm{spread}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s}$$\nThis factor represents an area-specific thermal resistance for spreading from an isothermal disk.\n\n**Formulation and Solution of the Self-Consistent Equation**\n\nThe total temperature rise at the active interface, which we denote as $T_c$, is the sum of two contributions: the temperature drop across the Kapitza resistance at the interface, and the temperature rise of the silicon surface due to heat spreading into the substrate. The system can be modeled as two thermal resistances in series.\n\nLet $T_{Si\\_surface}$ be the uniform temperature of the silicon at $z=0$ for $r \\le a$.\nThe temperature rise due to spreading is:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{spread}} = T_{Si\\_surface} - T_0 = q'' S_{\\mathrm{spread}}$$\nThe temperature drop across the thermal boundary resistance $R_K$ is defined by $\\Delta T_K = q'' R_K$. This drop occurs between the metal contact at temperature $T_c$ and the silicon surface at $T_{Si\\_surface}$:\n$$\\Delta T_K = T_c - T_{Si\\_surface} = q'' R_K$$\nThe total temperature rise of the contact metal, $\\Delta T_c = T_c - T_0$, is the sum of these two temperature differences:\n$$\\Delta T_c = (T_c - T_{Si\\_surface}) + (T_{Si\\_surface} - T_0) = \\Delta T_K + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{spread}}$$\n$$\\Delta T_c = q'' R_K + q'' S_{\\mathrm{spread}} = q'' (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}})$$\nThe problem becomes self-consistent because the heat flux $q''$ depends on the contact temperature $T_c$:\n$$q'' = J^2 \\rho_c(T_c) = J^2 \\rho_{c0} [1 + \\alpha(T_c - T_0)] = J^2 \\rho_{c0} (1 + \\alpha \\Delta T_c)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $q''$ into the equation for $\\Delta T_c$:\n$$\\Delta T_c = J^2 \\rho_{c0} (1 + \\alpha \\Delta T_c) (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}})$$\nThis is a linear equation for $\\Delta T_c$. To solve for $\\Delta T_c$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\\Delta T_c = J^2 \\rho_{c0} (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}}) + \\alpha J^2 \\rho_{c0} (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}}) \\Delta T_c$$\n$$\\Delta T_c \\left[ 1 - \\alpha J^2 \\rho_{c0} (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}}) \\right] = J^2 \\rho_{c0} (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}})$$\nSolving for $\\Delta T_c$:\n$$\\Delta T_c = \\frac{J^2 \\rho_{c0} (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}})}{1 - \\alpha J^2 \\rho_{c0} (R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}})}$$\nThe final interfacial temperature is $T_c = T_0 + \\Delta T_c$. Substituting $S_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s}$:\n$$T_c = T_0 + \\frac{J^2 \\rho_{c0} \\left(R_K + \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s}\\right)}{1 - \\alpha J^2 \\rho_{c0} \\left(R_K + \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s}\\right)}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions.\n1.  Calculate the spreading factor $S_{\\mathrm{spread}}$:\n    $$S_{\\mathrm{spread}} = \\frac{\\pi a}{4 k_s} = \\frac{\\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{4 (120\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})} = \\frac{5.0 \\pi}{480} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 3.2725 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,K\\,W^{-1}}$$\n2.  Calculate the total area-specific thermal resistance, $R''_{total} = R_K + S_{\\mathrm{spread}}$:\n    $$R''_{total} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-8}) + (3.2725 \\times 10^{-8}) = 8.2725 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,K\\,W^{-1}}$$\n3.  Calculate the numerator term, which represents the temperature rise if resistivity were constant:\n    Let $A = J^2 \\rho_{c0} R''_{total}$.\n    $$J^2 = (2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}})^2 = 4.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{A^2\\,m^{-4}}$$\n    $$A = (4.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{A^2\\,m^{-4}})(2.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,m^{2}})(8.2725 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,K\\,W^{-1}})$$\n    Recalling that $1\\,\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{A}^2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{W}$:\n    $$A = (8.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})(8.2725 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,K\\,W^{-1}}) = 6.618\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n4.  Calculate the denominator term $1 - \\alpha A$:\n    $$1 - \\alpha A = 1 - (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}})(6.618\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1 - 0.013236 = 0.986764$$\n5.  Calculate the temperature rise $\\Delta T_c$:\n    $$\\Delta T_c = \\frac{A}{1 - \\alpha A} = \\frac{6.618\\,\\mathrm{K}}{0.986764} \\approx 6.7069\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n6.  Calculate the final interfacial temperature $T_c$:\n    $$T_c = T_0 + \\Delta T_c = 300\\,\\mathrm{K} + 6.7069\\,\\mathrm{K} = 306.7069\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures gives 307 K.",
