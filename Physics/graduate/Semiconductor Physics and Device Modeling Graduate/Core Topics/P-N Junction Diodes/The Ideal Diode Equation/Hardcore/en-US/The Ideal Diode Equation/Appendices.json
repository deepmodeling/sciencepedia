This derivation begins with the fundamental hole continuity equation.\n\nThe one-dimensional continuity equation for holes is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_p}{\\partial x} - U_p\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the total hole concentration, $t$ is time, $q$ is the elementary charge, $J_p$ is the hole current density, and $U_p$ is the net recombination rate per unit volume.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem statement:\n1.  **Steady state:** The system does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Negligible electric field in the quasi-neutral region:** The hole current is driven solely by diffusion.

The $p$-side is degenerately doped so that $N_{A} \\gg N_{D}$, making the hole minority-carrier current injected into the $n$-region dominate the reverse-saturation current. The device parameters are: junction area $A=10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$, donor concentration on the $n$-side $N_{D}=10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, hole diffusivity in the $n$-region $D_{p}=10\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/s}$, hole lifetime in the $n$-region $\\tau_{p}=1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$, intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}=10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, and temperature $T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nStarting from the steady-state minority-carrier continuity equation in the $n$-region under low-level injection and the relation between equilibrium minority-carrier density and intrinsic carrier concentration, derive the expression for the reverse-saturation current $I_{s}$ contributed by holes injected from the $p^{+}$ side into the $n$-region.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and numerical calculation of the reverse-saturation current, $I_{s}$, for a single-sided abrupt $p^{+}$-$n$ silicon junction diode. The analysis is based on the Shockley ideal diode model. The problem states that the $p$-side is degenerately doped ($N_A \\gg N_D$), which implies that the current is dominated by the injection of holes (minority carriers) from the $p^{+}$-region into the $n$-region. We can therefore neglect the electron injection current from the $n$-region into the $p^{+}$-region.\n\nOur derivation begins with the steady-state minority-carrier continuity equation for holes in the $n$-type quasi-neutral region (QNR). In one dimension, under steady-state conditions ($\\frac{\\partial p_n}{\\partial t} = 0$), and with no external generation sources like light, the equation is:\n$$ D_p \\frac{d^2 p_n(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{p_n(x) - p_{n0}}{\\tau_p} = 0 $$\nwhere $p_n(x)$ is the total hole concentration at position $x$ in the $n$-QNR, $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium hole concentration, $D_p$ is the hole diffusivity, and $\\tau_p$ is the hole minority-carrier lifetime. The origin, $x=0$, is set at the boundary between the depletion region and the $n$-QNR.\n\nIt is convenient to work with the excess minority-carrier concentration, defined as $\\delta p_n(x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0}$. Substituting this into the continuity equation, and noting that $\\frac{d^2 p_{n0}}{dx^2} = 0$ since $p_{n0}$ is a constant, we obtain the minority-carrier diffusion equation:\n$$ D_p \\frac{d^2(\\delta p_n(x))}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n(x)}{\\tau_p} = 0 $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2(\\delta p_n(x))}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n(x)}{L_p^2} = 0 $$\nwhere $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$ is the minority-carrier diffusion length for holes. This is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation, whose general solution is:\n$$ \\delta p_n(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) $$\nTo find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we apply two boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is at the edge of the depletion region, $x=0$. According to the \"law of the junction,\" the minority-carrier concentration at this boundary is modulated by the applied bias voltage $V_A$:\n$$ p_n(0) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThus, the excess concentration at $x=0$ is:\n$$ \\delta p_n(0) = p_n(0) - p_{n0} = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\n\nThe second boundary condition is deep inside the $n$-QNR. Assuming a long-base diode (i.e., the width of the $n$-region is much greater than $L_p$), the excess carriers must recombine and their concentration must vanish far from the junction:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\delta p_n(x) = 0 $$\nApplying this condition to the general solution, the term $C_1 \\exp(\\frac{x}{L_p})$ would diverge as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, its coefficient $C_1$ must be zero. The solution simplifies to:\n$$ \\delta p_n(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) $$\nNow, applying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\delta p_n(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2 $$\nSo, we have $C_2 = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$. The final expression for the excess hole concentration profile in the $n$-QNR is:\n$$ \\delta p_n(x) = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we find the hole current. In the QNR, the electric field is assumed to be negligible, so the current is driven purely by diffusion. The hole current density, $J_p(x)$, is given by Fick's first law:\n$$ J_p(x) = -q D_p \\frac{d p_n(x)}{dx} = -q D_p \\frac{d(\\delta p_n(x))}{dx} $$\nDifferentiating $\\delta p_n(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\delta p_n(x))}{dx} = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_p}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this derivative into the expression for $J_p(x)$:\n$$ J_p(x) = -q D_p \\left[ p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_p}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ J_p(x) = \\frac{q D_p p_{n0}}{L_p} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) $$\nThe total current is found by evaluating the current density at the edge of the depletion region, $x=0$, and multiplying by the cross-sectional area $A$. Since recombination in the depletion region is neglected, this current is constant throughout the device.\n$$ I = I_p(x=0) = A \\cdot J_p(x=0) = A \\frac{q D_p p_{n0}}{L_p} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) $$\nThis expression has the form of the Shockley ideal diode equation, $I = I_s \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_A}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$. By comparison, we identify the reverse-saturation current $I_s$ as:\n$$ I_s = A \\frac{q D_p p_{n0}}{L_p} $$\nThe equilibrium minority-carrier concentration, $p_{n0}$, can be expressed in terms of the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ and the donor doping concentration $N_D$ using the law of mass action ($np = n_i^2$). In the $n$-type semiconductor at equilibrium, the majority carrier concentration is $n_{n0} \\approx N_D$. Thus:\n$$ p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_{n0}} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} $$\nSubstituting for $p_{n0}$ and $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$ into the expression for $I_s$:\n$$ I_s = A q \\frac{D_p}{\\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}} \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} = A q \\frac{\\sqrt{D_p}}{\\sqrt{\\tau_p}} \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} $$\nThe final derived expression for the reverse-saturation current is:\n$$ I_s = A q n_i^2 \\frac{1}{N_D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D_p}{\\tau_p}} $$\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical evaluation using the provided parameters:\n- $A = 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$\n- $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- $N_D = 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $D_p = 10\\ \\mathrm{cm^2/s}$\n- $\\tau_p = 1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $n_i = 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ I_s = (10^{-4}) (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) (10^{10})^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{10^{16}}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{10^{-6}}} $$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{cm^2}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{C}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{cm^{-6}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{cm^3}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(\\mathrm{cm^2/s})/(\\mathrm{s})} = \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\mathrm{A}$.\n$$ I_s = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\cdot (10^{-4}) \\cdot (10^{20}) \\cdot (10^{-16}) \\cdot \\sqrt{10^7} \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\n$$ I_s = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\cdot 10^{-4+20-16} \\cdot \\sqrt{10 \\times 10^6} \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\n$$ I_s = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\cdot 10^0 \\cdot (\\sqrt{10} \\times 10^3) \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\n$$ I_s = 1.602 \\times \\sqrt{10} \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\nUsing $\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16227766$:\n$$ I_s \\approx 1.602 \\times 3.16227766 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\n$$ I_s \\approx 5.0659688 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ I_s \\approx 5.066 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{A} $$\nThis is the numerically evaluated reverse-saturation current.",

Rounding to three significant figures and expressing the unitless ratio yields\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{Ge}}(V)}{I_{\\mathrm{Si}}(V)}=\\frac{I_{s,\\mathrm{Ge}}}{I_{s,\\mathrm{Si}}}\\approx 1.04\\times 10^{7}.$$",
