The provided numerical values for material parameters and doping concentrations are physically realistic for a silicon device. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided, and is mathematically well-posed, leading to a unique solution. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem is **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Reverse Saturation Current $I_s$\nThe total current in a $p$-$n$ diode is the sum of the minority carrier diffusion currents injected across the depletion region. The reverse saturation current, $I_s$, represents this flow under a large reverse bias. We derive the contributions from the $p$-side and $n$-side separately. Let the metallurgical junction be at $x=0$, with the $p$-region at $x<0$ and the $n$-region at $x>0$. The edges of the depletion region are at $x=-x_p$ and $x=x_n$.\n\n**1. Hole Diffusion Current from the $n$-side ($I_p$)**\n\nIn the quasi-neutral $n$-region ($x > x_n$), the minority carriers are holes. Under the assumption of negligible electric field, the hole current is purely diffusive:\n$$J_p(x) = -q D_p \\frac{dp_n(x)}{dx}$$\nThe steady-state continuity equation for holes is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial p_n}{\\partial t} = 0 = -\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dJ_p}{dx} - \\frac{p_n(x) - p_{n0}}{\\tau_p}$$\nwhere $p_n(x)$ is the hole concentration, $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium hole concentration, and $\\tau_p$ is the hole lifetime. Substituting the expression for $J_p(x)$ into the continuity equation gives the minority carrier diffusion equation for the excess hole concentration $\\delta p_n(x) = p_n(x) - p_{n0}$:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta p_n(x))}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n(x)}{D_p \\tau_p} = 0$$\nUsing the definition of the hole diffusion length, $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$, this becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta p_n)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_n}{L_p^2} = 0$$\nWe define a new coordinate $x' = x - x_n$ for the quasi-neutral $n$-region ($x' \\geq 0$). The general solution is $\\delta p_n(x') = C_1 \\exp(-x'/L_p) + C_2 \\exp(x'/L_p)$.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. Far from the junction ($x' \\to \\infty$), the excess concentration decays to zero: $\\delta p_n(\\infty) = 0$, which implies $C_2 = 0$.\n2. At the depletion edge ($x' = 0$), the law of the junction applies: $p_n(x_n) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $V_a$ is the applied voltage. Thus, $\\delta p_n(0) = p_n(x_n) - p_{n0} = p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$.\n\nFrom the boundary conditions, $C_1 = p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$. The excess hole profile is:\n$$\\delta p_n(x') = p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x'}{L_p}\\right)$$\nThe hole current density at the depletion edge ($x' = 0$) is:\n$$J_p(x_n) = -q D_p \\left. \\frac{d p_n(x')}{dx'} \\right|_{x'=0} = -q D_p \\left. \\frac{d \\delta p_n(x')}{dx'} \\right|_{x'=0}$$\n$$J_p(x_n) = -q D_p \\left[ p_{n0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_p}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{q D_p}{L_p} p_{n0} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nUnder the assumption of nondegenerate carriers, the mass-action law gives $p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$. Thus:\n$$J_p(x_n) = \\frac{q D_p n_i^2}{L_p N_D} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\n\n**2. Electron Diffusion Current from the $p$-side ($I_n$)**\n\nBy symmetry, we analyze the minority electrons in the quasi-neutral $p$-region ($x < -x_p$). The diffusion equation for the excess electron concentration $\\delta n_p(x) = n_p(x) - n_{p0}$ is:\n$$\\frac{d^2(\\delta n_p)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta n_p}{L_n^2} = 0$$\nwhere $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$. The solution, satisfying the boundary condition $\\delta n_p(-\\infty)=0$, is found using the coordinate $x'' = x+x_p \\le 0$. The minority electron current density at the depletion edge $x=-x_p$ is:\n$$J_n(-x_p) = q D_n \\left. \\frac{d n_p(x'')}{dx''} \\right|_{x''=0} = \\frac{q D_n}{L_n} n_{p0} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nUsing the mass-action law $n_{p0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A}$:\n$$J_n(-x_p) = \\frac{q D_n n_i^2}{L_n N_A} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\n\n**3. Total Current and Reverse Saturation Current**\n\nThe total current density $J$ is the sum of the electron and hole diffusion currents, which are constant across the depletion region:\n$$J = J_p(x_n) + J_n(-x_p) = q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A}\\right) \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nThis is the ideal diode equation, $J = J_s \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_a}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)$. The reverse saturation current, $I_s = A J_s$, where $A$ is the junction area, is therefore:\n$$I_s = A q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n### Calculation of the Factor $F$\nThe factor $F$ is the ratio of the reverse saturation current at $N_{A1} = 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to that at $N_{A2} = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n$$F = \\frac{I_s(N_A = N_{A1})}{I_s(N_A = N_{A2})} = \\frac{A q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A1}}\\right)}{A q n_i^2 \\left(\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A2}}\\right)}$$\nThe common factor $A q n_i^2$ cancels out:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A1}}}{\\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} + \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_{A2}}}$$\nWe can simplify the terms $\\frac{D}{L}$ using $L = \\sqrt{D\\tau}$:\n$$\\frac{D_p}{L_p} = \\frac{D_p}{\\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_p}{\\tau_p}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{D_n}{L_n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_n}{\\tau_n}}$$\nSubstitute the given numerical values:\n- $N_D = 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $N_{A1} = 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $N_{A2} = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $\\frac{D_p}{\\tau_p} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 12 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s^2}$\n- $\\frac{D_n}{\\tau_n} = \\frac{35\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 35 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s^2}$\n\nNow, we compute the two terms in the numerator and denominator:\nTerm from $n$-side: $\\frac{\\sqrt{D_p/\\tau_p}}{N_D} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12 \\times 10^6}}{10^{16}} = \\sqrt{12} \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^4/s}$\nTerm from $p$-side for $N_{A1}$: $\\frac{\\sqrt{D_n/\\tau_n}}{N_{A1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{35 \\times 10^6}}{10^{15}} = \\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-12} = 10\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^4/s}$\nTerm from $p$-side for $N_{A2}$: $\\frac{\\sqrt{D_n/\\tau_n}}{N_{A2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{35 \\times 10^6}}{10^{18}} = \\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-15} = 0.01\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{cm^4/s}$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{12} \\times 10^{-13} + 10\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}}{\\sqrt{12} \\times 10^{-13} + 0.01\\sqrt{35} \\times 10^{-13}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12} + 10\\sqrt{35}}{\\sqrt{12} + 0.01\\sqrt{35}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically:\n$\\sqrt{12} \\approx 3.46410$\n$\\sqrt{35} \\approx 5.91608$\n$$F \\approx \\frac{3.46410 + 10 \\times 5.91608}{3.46410 + 0.01 \\times 5.91608} = \\frac{3.46410 + 59.1608}{3.46410 + 0.0591608} = \\frac{62.6249}{3.52326} \\approx 17.7746$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $17.8$.",

The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between carrier concentrations and the effective densities of states in the conduction band, $N_c$, and valence band, $N_v$. The electron concentration $n$ is given by the integral of the density of states in the conduction band, $g_c(E)$, multiplied by the Fermi-Dirac occupation probability, $f(E)$, over all available energy states in the band:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} g_c(E) f(E) \\, dE$$\nwhere $E_c$ is the conduction band minimum.\n\nUnder the parabolic-band approximation, the density of states is given by:\n$$g_c(E) = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant. The problem statement uses a single symbol $m_e^*$ for the density-of-states effective mass, which incorporates effects like valley degeneracy.\n\nFor a nondegenerate semiconductor, the Fermi level $E_F$ is several $k_B T$ away from the band edges, allowing the Fermi-Dirac distribution to be approximated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:\n$$f(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the approximations for $g_c(E)$ and $f(E)$ into the integral for $n$:\n$$n = \\int_{E_c}^{\\infty} \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE$$\nThis integral can be evaluated by setting $x = (E - E_c) / (k_B T)$, which gives $dE = k_B T \\, dx$.\n$$n = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}}{h^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (k_B T x)^{1/2} \\exp(-x) \\, k_B T \\, dx$$\n$$n = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{1/2} \\exp(-x) \\, dx$$\nThe integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(3/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$.\n$$n = \\frac{4\\pi (2m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis defines the effective density of states in the conduction band, $N_c$:\n$$N_c = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{e}^{\\ast} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nsuch that $n = N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$. We see that $N_c \\propto (m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$.\n\nA similar derivation for the hole concentration $p$ yields:\n$$p = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_v$ is the valence band maximum and $N_v$ is the effective density of states in the valence band:\n$$N_v = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{h}^{\\ast} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nwhich shows that $N_v \\propto (m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$.\n\nThe law of mass action in thermal equilibrium states that the product $np$ is a constant for a given material at a fixed temperature, independent of doping. This product is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$:\n$$n_i^2 = np = \\left[N_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] \\left[N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_v}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$n_i^2 = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_c - E_v}{k_B T}\\right) = N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_g = E_c - E_v$ is the bandgap energy.\n\nNow, we relate $n_i^2$ to the reverse saturation current $I_s$. For a long-base, abrupt $p^{+}\\text{-}n$ diode, the reverse saturation current is dominated by the diffusion of minority carriers from the more lightly doped side. In this case, this is the diffusion of holes from the $n$-side. The diffusion of minority electrons from the heavily doped $p^{+}$-side is negligible. Thus, $I_s$ is approximately the hole diffusion current component:\n$$I_s \\approx q A \\frac{D_p}{L_p} p_{n0}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $A$ is the diode cross-sectional area, $D_p$ is the hole diffusion coefficient, $L_p$ is the hole diffusion length, and $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium concentration of minority holes in the $n$-type region.\n\nIn the $n$-type quasi-neutral region, the equilibrium majority carrier concentration is $n_{n0} \\approx N_d$, the donor concentration. Using the law of mass action, we find $p_{n0}$:\n$$p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_{n0}} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_d}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I_s$:\n$$I_s \\approx q A \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_d} n_i^2$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $n_i^2$:\n$$I_s \\approx \\left(q A \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_d}\\right) \\left[N_c N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)\\right]$$\nFinally, we substitute the dependencies of $N_c$ and $N_v$ on the effective masses:\n$$I_s \\propto N_c N_v \\propto (m_{e}^{\\ast})^{3/2} (m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2} = (m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$$\nThe problem states that $E_g$, $T$, doping concentrations ($N_d$), and all transport properties determining $D_p$ and $L_p$ are unchanged. The other terms ($q$, $A$, $k_B$, $h$) are fundamental constants. Therefore, the entire prefactor multiplying $(m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$ is a constant.\n\nLet the initial current and effective masses be $I_s$, $m_{e}^{\\ast}$, and $m_{h}^{\\ast}$. The perturbed current and masses are $I_s'$, $m_{e}^{\\ast'} = \\alpha m_{e}^{\\ast}$, and $m_{h}^{\\ast'} = \\beta m_{h}^{\\ast}$. We can write the relationship as:\n$$I_s = K (m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}$$\n$$I_s' = K (m_{e}^{\\ast'} m_{h}^{\\ast'})^{3/2}$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nThe scaling law for the ratio $I_s'/I_s$ is then:\n$$\\frac{I_s'}{I_s} = \\frac{K (m_{e}^{\\ast'} m_{h}^{\\ast'})^{3/2}}{K (m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/2}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{e}^{\\ast'} m_{h}^{\\ast'}}{m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast}}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nSubstituting the scaling factors $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{I_s'}{I_s} = \\left(\\frac{(\\alpha m_{e}^{\\ast}) (\\beta m_{h}^{\\ast})}{m_{e}^{\\ast} m_{h}^{\\ast}}\\right)^{3/2} = (\\alpha \\beta)^{3/2}$$\nThis is the desired explicit scaling law.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values $\\alpha = 1.30$ and $\\beta = 0.90$.\n$$\\frac{I_s'}{I_s} = (1.30 \\times 0.90)^{3/2} = (1.17)^{3/2}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$(1.17)^{1.5} = 1.26554817...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.266$.",

Use the drift-diffusion framework, the minority-carrier diffusion equation, and thermal equilibrium relations as the fundamental base.\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is modeled over temperature $T$ by\n$$\nn_{i}(T)=n_{i0}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_{0}}\\right)\\right],\n$$\nwhere $T_{0}$ is a reference temperature, $E_{g}$ is the (assumed temperature-independent) bandgap, and $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann’s constant. The hole mobility in the $n$ region follows\n$$\n\\mu_{p}(T)=\\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-m},\n$$\nwith a constant exponent $m>0$, and the SRH minority-hole lifetime follows\n$$\n\\tau_{p}(T)=\\tau_{0}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{s},\n$$\nwith a constant exponent $s$. The Einstein relation holds, so that the hole diffusion coefficient is $D_{p}(T)=(k_{B}T/q)\\mu_{p}(T)$, and the hole diffusion length is $L_{p}(T)=\\sqrt{D_{p}(T)\\tau_{p}(T)}$.\n\nAn engineer “ignores the temperature dependence of $D_{p}$ and $L_{p}$” when extrapolating the reverse saturation current from $T_{0}$ to $T$, i.e., she uses only the $n_{i}(T)$ factor and assumes $D_{p}/L_{p}$ is constant with temperature. Define the approximation’s fractional error at temperature $T$ relative to the true value as\n$$\n\\varepsilon(T)\\equiv \\left|\\frac{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{approx}}(T)}{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{true}}(T)}-1\\right|.\n$$\n\nStarting from the minority-carrier diffusion equation in the $n$ region, the appropriate boundary conditions at the depletion edge, and the low-level injection limit, derive an explicit closed-form expression for $\\varepsilon(T)$ in terms of $T/T_{0}$, $m$, and $s$, eliminating all device-specific prefactors. Your derivation must make clear why the only residual temperature dependence in the ratio arises from $D_{p}(T)$ and $L_{p}(T)$ once $n_{i}(T)$ is factored out.\n\nFinally, based on your expression, discuss in words what combinations of $(m,s)$ and temperature excursions $T/T_{0}$ make the “ignore $D$ and $L$” approximation acceptable for a tolerance of $0.1$; you may illustrate with physically reasonable values but do not compute any numeric answer for the final expression.\n\nYour final answer must be the single closed-form analytic expression for $\\varepsilon(T)$, with no units and no numerical evaluation.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the reverse saturation current, $I_{s}$, from fundamental principles. The problem specifies a one-sided $p^{+}$-$n$ diode where the current is dominated by minority-hole injection into the $n$-type region. We consider the steady-state, one-dimensional minority-carrier diffusion equation for the excess hole concentration, $\\delta p_{n}(x) = p_{n}(x) - p_{n0}$, in the quasi-neutral $n$-region (for $x \\ge 0$, with the depletion region edge at $x=0$):\n$$\nD_{p} \\frac{d^2 \\delta p_{n}(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_{n}(x)}{\\tau_{p}} = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\delta p_{n}(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\delta p_{n}(x)}{L_{p}^2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $L_{p} = \\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}$ is the minority-hole diffusion length. The general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\delta p_{n}(x) = C_{1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{p}}\\right) + C_{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_{p}}\\right)\n$$\nThe constants $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are determined by the boundary conditions. The problem states that the quasi-neutral width is much larger than the diffusion length (a \"long-base\" diode). Deep in the $n$-region, as $x \\to \\infty$, the excess carrier concentration must decay to zero:\n$$\n\\delta p_{n}(x \\to \\infty) = 0\n$$\nThis condition requires that $C_{2}=0$. At the edge of the depletion region, $x=0$, the law of the junction under an applied voltage $V_{a}$ dictates the boundary condition:\n$$\np_{n}(0) = p_{n0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $p_{n0}$ is the equilibrium minority-hole concentration. The excess concentration at $x=0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\delta p_{n}(0) = p_{n}(0) - p_{n0} = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nApplying this to our solution at $x=0$ gives $C_{1} = \\delta p_{n}(0)$. Thus, the excess hole profile is:\n$$\n\\delta p_{n}(x) = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{p}}\\right)\n$$\nThe hole current density, $J_{p}(x)$, is due to diffusion under the low-level injection assumption and is given by:\n$$\nJ_{p}(x) = -q D_{p} \\frac{d p_{n}(x)}{dx} = -q D_{p} \\frac{d \\delta p_{n}(x)}{dx}\n$$\nEvaluating the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\delta p_{n}(x)}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{L_{p}} \\delta p_{n}(x) = -\\frac{1}{L_{p}} p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_{p}}\\right)\n$$\nThe hole current density injected into the $n$-region is evaluated at $x=0$:\n$$\nJ_{p}(0) = -q D_{p} \\left[ -\\frac{p_{n0}}{L_{p}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right) \\right] = q \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}} p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nFor a diode with cross-sectional area $A$, the total current is $I = A J_{p}(0)$, assuming hole current dominates. This gives the ideal diode equation $I = I_{s} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_{a}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$, where the reverse saturation current $I_{s}$ is identified as:\n$$\nI_{s} = A q \\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}} p_{n0}\n$$\nThe equilibrium hole concentration $p_{n0}$ is related to the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}$ and the donor doping concentration $N_{D}$ by the mass-action law, $n_{n0}p_{n0} = n_{i}^2$. Assuming full ionization, $n_{n0} \\approx N_{D}$, so $p_{n0} \\approx n_{i}^2 / N_{D}$. Substituting this into the expression for $I_{s}$ gives:\n$$\nI_{s}(T) = A q \\frac{D_{p}(T)}{L_{p}(T)} \\frac{n_{i}^{2}(T)}{N_{D}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the \"true\" reverse saturation current, $I_{s}^{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$.\n\nThe engineer's approximation, $I_{s}^{\\mathrm{approx}}(T)$, assumes the term $\\frac{D_{p}}{L_{p}}$ is constant with temperature, equal to its value at the reference temperature $T_{0}$. All other temperature dependence is assumed to come from $n_{i}^{2}(T)$.\n$$\nI_{s}^{\\mathrm{approx}}(T) = A q \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{L_{p}(T_{0})} \\frac{n_{i}^{2}(T)}{N_{D}}\n$$\nThe fractional error $\\varepsilon(T)$ is defined as $\\left| \\frac{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{approx}}(T)}{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{true}}(T)} - 1 \\right|$. Let's compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{approx}}(T)}{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{true}}(T)} = \\frac{A q \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{L_{p}(T_{0})} \\frac{n_{i}^{2}(T)}{N_{D}}}{A q \\frac{D_{p}(T)}{L_{p}(T)} \\frac{n_{i}^{2}(T)}{N_{D}}} = \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})/L_{p}(T_{0})}{D_{p}(T)/L_{p}(T)}\n$$\nThis shows that the error is entirely due to neglecting the temperature dependence of the ratio $D_{p}/L_{p}$, as all other factors (including the dominant $n_{i}^{2}(T)$ term) cancel out.\n\nNow we must evaluate the temperature dependence of $D_{p}(T)/L_{p}(T)$. We are given:\n$\\mu_{p}(T) = \\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-m}$\n$\\tau_{p}(T) = \\tau_{0}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{s}$\n$D_{p}(T) = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}\\mu_{p}(T)$\n$L_{p}(T) = \\sqrt{D_{p}(T)\\tau_{p}(T)}$\n\nLet's analyze the term $D_{p}(T)/L_{p}(T) = D_{p}(T) / \\sqrt{D_{p}(T)\\tau_{p}(T)} = \\sqrt{D_{p}(T)/\\tau_{p}(T)}$.\nFirst, find the temperature dependence of $D_{p}(T)$:\n$$\nD_{p}(T) = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-m} = \\left(\\frac{k_{B}T_{0}\\mu_{0}}{q}\\right) \\frac{T}{T_{0}} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-m} = D_{p}(T_{0}) \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-m}\n$$\nHere, we identified $D_{p}(T_{0}) = \\frac{k_{B}T_{0}}{q}\\mu_{p}(T_{0}) = \\frac{k_{B}T_{0}}{q}\\mu_{0}$.\nNow, form the ratio inside the square root:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{p}(T)}{\\tau_{p}(T)} = \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0}) \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-m}}{\\tau_{0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{s}} = \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{\\tau_{0}} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-m-s}\n$$\nNote that $\\tau_{p}(T_{0}) = \\tau_{0}$.\nTaking the square root gives the temperature dependence of $D_{p}/L_{p}$:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{p}(T)}{L_{p}(T)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{\\tau_{0}}} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{\\frac{1-m-s}{2}}\n$$\nThe term at the reference temperature is $\\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{L_{p}(T_{0})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{\\tau_{p}(T_{0})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{\\tau_{0}}}$.\nSo, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{p}(T)}{L_{p}(T)} = \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{L_{p}(T_{0})} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{\\frac{1-m-s}{2}}\n$$\nNow substitute this back into the ratio of currents:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{approx}}(T)}{I_{s}^{\\mathrm{true}}(T)} = \\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})/L_{p}(T_{0})}{\\frac{D_{p}(T_{0})}{L_{p}(T_{0})} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{\\frac{1-m-s}{2}}} = \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-\\frac{1-m-s}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{\\frac{m+s-1}{2}}\n$$\nThe fractional error is therefore given by the explicit closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(T) = \\left| \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{\\frac{m+s-1}{2}} - 1 \\right|\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the normalized temperature $T/T_{0}$ and the exponents $m$ and $s$, as required.\n\nFinally, for the discussion part:\nThe approximation is acceptable for a tolerance of $0.1$ when $\\varepsilon(T) < 0.1$, which implies:\n$$\n0.9 < \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{\\frac{m+s-1}{2}} < 1.1\n$$\nThe approximation is most acceptable under two general conditions:\n1. The temperature excursion from the reference temperature is small. If $T \\approx T_{0}$, then $T/T_{0} \\approx 1$. Since $1$ raised to any finite power is $1$, the term $\\left(T/T_{0}\\right)^{\\frac{m+s-1}{2}}$ will be very close to $1$, making the error $\\varepsilon(T)$ small regardless of the values of $m$ and $s$.\n2. The exponent $\\frac{m+s-1}{2}$ is close to zero. The approximation would be perfectly exact ($\\varepsilon(T) = 0$) if the exponent is zero, which requires $m+s-1=0$, or $m+s=1$. This specific condition means that the combined temperature dependencies of the mobility $\\mu_{p} \\propto T^{-m}$, the lifetime $\\tau_{p} \\propto T^{s}$, and the thermal voltage term in the diffusion coefficient $D_{p} \\propto T \\mu_{p}$ exactly cancel out in the ratio $\\sqrt{D_{p}/\\tau_{p}}$. If the sum of the physical exponents $m+s$ is close to $1$, the approximation will be good even over a wide temperature range.\n\nFor a physical illustration, consider silicon where mobility is limited by lattice scattering, so $m \\approx 2.3$. The lifetime exponent $s$ depends on the specific recombination center; a value of $s=-0.5$ is plausible for some centers. In this case, $m+s = 2.3 - 0.5 = 1.8$. The exponent in the error expression is $\\frac{1.8-1}{2} = 0.4$. The condition for an error less than $0.1$ is $0.9 < (T/T_{0})^{0.4} < 1.1$. This restricts the temperature ratio to $0.9^{1/0.4} < T/T_{0} < 1.1^{1/0.4}$, or approximately $0.77 < T/T_{0} < 1.27$. If $T_{0}=300 \\mathrm{~K}$ ($27^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$), this corresponds to a temperature range of approximately $231 \\mathrm{~K}$ to $381 \\mathrm{~K}$ ($-42^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ to $108^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$). Outside of this range, the simple approximation of ignoring the temperature dependence of $D_{p}$ and $L_{p}$ would lead to an error greater than $10\\%$. Thus, the acceptability of the approximation depends critically on both the range of operating temperatures and the specific physics governing carrier scattering ($m$) and recombination ($s$).",
