Let the metallurgical junction be at $x = 0$, with the depletion region extending from $x = -x_{p}$ on the $p$-side to $x = +x_{n}$ on the $n$-side.

Let $V=V_{\\text{BR}}$ and define the function $F(T, V) = A_{n}(T) C_{1} \\sqrt{V} E_{2}\\left(\\frac{B_{n}(T) C_{2}}{\\sqrt{V}}\\right) - 1 = 0$, where $C_{1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon_{s}}{q N_{D}}}$ and $C_{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{s}}{2 q N_{D}}}$. Then $\\frac{dV}{dT} = -\\frac{\\partial F / \\partial T}{\\partial F / \\partial V}$.\nLet $x(T,V) = \\frac{B_{n}(T) C_{2}}{\\sqrt{V}}$. Using the recurrence relation $E_2(x) + x E_1(x) = e^{-x}$ and the derivative identity $\\frac{dE_2(x)}{dx} = -E_1(x)$, we find the partial derivatives.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T} = C_{1}\\sqrt{V} \\left[ \\frac{dA_{n}}{dT} E_{2}(x) - A_{n}(T) E_{1}(x) \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial T} \\right] = C_{1}\\sqrt{V} E_{2}(x) \\frac{dA_{n}}{dT} - A_{n}(T)C_{1}C_{2} E_{1}(x) \\frac{dB_{n}}{dT} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V} = \\frac{A_{n}(T) C_{1}}{2\\sqrt{V}} [E_{2}(x) + x E_{1}(x)] = \\frac{A_{n}(T) C_{1}}{2\\sqrt{V}} \\exp(-x(T,V)) $$\nThe sign of $\\frac{dV_{\\text{BR}}}{dT}$ at $T = T_{0}$ is determined by the signs of these partial derivatives.\nThe denominator, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}$, is always positive since $A_n, C_1, \\sqrt{V}$, and the exponential term are all positive.\nFor the numerator, we evaluate the derivatives of $A_n(T)$ and $B_n(T)$ at $T=T_0$:\n$$ A_n(T) = A_0 (T/T_0)^{-m} \\implies \\frac{dA_n}{dT}\\bigg|_{T_0} = -\\frac{m A_0}{T_0} $$\nSince $m0, A_00, T_00$, this derivative is negative.\n$$ B_n(T) = B_0 (T/T_0)^{p} \\implies \\frac{dB_n}{dT}\\bigg|_{T_0} = \\frac{p B_0}{T_0} $$\nSince $p0, B_00, T_00$, this derivative is positive.\nNow we examine the sign of the numerator, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}$, at $T=T_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}\\bigg|_{T_0} = \\underbrace{C_{1}\\sqrt{V} E_{2}(x_0)}_{(\\text{pos})} \\underbrace{\\frac{dA_{n}}{dT}\\bigg|_{T_0}}_{(\\text{neg})} - \\underbrace{A_{n}(T_0)C_{1}C_{2} E_{1}(x_0)}_{(\\text{pos})} \\underbrace{\\frac{dB_{n}}{dT}\\bigg|_{T_0}}_{(\\text{pos})} $$\nThe first term is negative. The second term is also negative. The sum of two negative terms is negative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}\\bigg|_{T=T_0}  0 $$\nFinally, we determine the sign of the temperature coefficient of the breakdown voltage:\n$$ \\frac{dV_{\\text{BR}}}{dT}\\bigg|_{T=T_0} = -\\frac{\\partial F / \\partial T}{\\partial F / \\partial V}\\bigg|_{T=T_0} = -\\frac{(\\text{negative})}{(\\text{positive})} = \\text{positive} $$\nThe sign is positive. The problem asks for the sign to be expressed as a pure number, which is $+1$.",
