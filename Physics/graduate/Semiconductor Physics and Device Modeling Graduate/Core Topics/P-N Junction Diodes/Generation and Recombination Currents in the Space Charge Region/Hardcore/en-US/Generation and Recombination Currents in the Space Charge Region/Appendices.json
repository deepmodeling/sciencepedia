The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Depletion Width $W$\n\nWe begin with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation relating the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$ to the charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}\n$$\nLet the metallurgical junction be at $x=0$. The space charge region extends from $x = -x_p$ on the $p$-side to $x = x_n$ on the $n$-side. The total depletion width is $W = x_p + x_n$. According to the depletion approximation, the charge density is given by:\n$$\n\\rho(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n-qN_A  \\text{for } -x_p  x  0 \\\\\n+qN_D  \\text{for } 0  x  x_n \\\\\n0  \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe electric field is $E(x) = -\\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx}$. Integrating Poisson's equation once gives the electric field: $\\frac{dE(x)}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_s}$.\n\nFor the $p$-side ($-x_p  x  0$):\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s} \\implies E(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}x + C_1\n$$\nThe boundary condition is that the electric field must be zero at the edge of the depletion region, $E(-x_p)=0$. This yields $C_1 = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}x_p$.\n$$\nE(x) = -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x+x_p) \\quad \\text{for } -x_p \\le x \\le 0\n$$\nFor the $n$-side ($0  x  x_n$):\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s} \\implies E(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}x + C_2\n$$\nThe boundary condition is $E(x_n)=0$, which yields $C_2 = -\\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}x_n$.\n$$\nE(x) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x-x_n) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le x_n\n$$\nThe electric field must be continuous at the junction $x=0$. Equating the two expressions for $E(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$\n-\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(0+x_p) = \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(0-x_n) \\implies N_A x_p = N_D x_n\n$$\nThis is the charge neutrality condition: the total negative charge per unit area on the $p$-side, $-qN_Ax_p$, must balance the total positive charge per unit area on the $n$-side, $+qN_Dx_n$.\n\nThe total potential drop $V$ across the junction is the integral of the electric field over the depletion width:\n$$\nV = -\\int_{-x_p}^{x_n} E(x) dx = -\\left[ \\int_{-x_p}^{0} -\\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}(x+x_p)dx + \\int_{0}^{x_n} \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}(x-x_n)dx \\right]\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\nV = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}\\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} + x_p x\\right]_{-x_p}^0 - \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}\\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - x_n x\\right]_0^{x_n}\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{qN_A}{\\epsilon_s}\\left(0 - \\left(\\frac{x_p^2}{2}-x_p^2\\right)\\right) - \\frac{qN_D}{\\epsilon_s}\\left(\\left(\\frac{x_n^2}{2}-x_n^2\\right) - 0\\right) = \\frac{qN_A}{2\\epsilon_s}x_p^2 + \\frac{qN_D}{2\\epsilon_s}x_n^2\n$$\nSo, we have $V = \\frac{q}{2\\epsilon_s} (N_A x_p^2 + N_D x_n^2)$.\nWe can express $x_p$ and $x_n$ in terms of the total width $W$ using $W = x_p + x_n$ and $N_A x_p = N_D x_n$.\nFrom the charge neutrality, $x_p = \\frac{N_D}{N_A}x_n$. Substituting into the expression for $W$:\n$W = \\frac{N_D}{N_A}x_n + x_n = x_n \\left(1 + \\frac{N_D}{N_A}\\right) = x_n \\frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A} \\implies x_n = W \\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D}$.\nSimilarly, $x_p = W \\frac{N_D}{N_A+N_D}$.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $V$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{q}{2\\epsilon_s} \\left[ N_A \\left(W \\frac{N_D}{N_A+N_D}\\right)^2 + N_D \\left(W \\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{qW^2}{2\\epsilon_s(N_A+N_D)^2} [N_A N_D^2 + N_D N_A^2] = \\frac{qW^2}{2\\epsilon_s(N_A+N_D)^2} [N_A N_D(N_D+N_A)]\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{qW^2}{2\\epsilon_s} \\frac{N_A N_D}{N_A+N_D}\n$$\nSolving for $W$:\n$$\nW^2 = \\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A N_D} = \\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the depletion width is:\n$$\nW = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $W$\nUsing the given parameters:\n$N_{A} = 7.5 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_{D} = 3.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n$\\epsilon_{s} = 1.04 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{F/cm}$\n$q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{C}$\n$V = 6.2\\ \\text{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term with doping concentrations.

Since $1\\ \\text{cm} = 10^4\\ \\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$\nW \\approx (1.1583 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 10^4\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 1.1583\\ \\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $W = 1.158\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n### Discussion on Scaling and Generation Current\nThe derived expression for the depletion width is $W = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{q} \\left(\\frac{1}{N_A} + \\frac{1}{N_D}\\right)}$. The total potential $V$ is the sum of the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ and the applied reverse bias magnitude $V_R$, i.e., $V = V_{bi} + V_R$. For increasing reverse bias, $V$ increases, and for $V_R \\gg V_{bi}$, we have $V \\approx V_R$. The scaling of $W$ with reverse bias is therefore governed by its dependence on $V$. From the formula, it is clear that $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$.\n\n(i) **Symmetric junction ($N_A = N_D = N$)**: The term in parentheses becomes $\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{2}{N}$. The expression for $W$ simplifies to $W = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\epsilon_s V}{qN}}$. The scaling remains $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$.\n\n(ii) **One-sided junction ($N_D \\gg N_A$, a $p^{+}$-$n$ junction)**: In this case, $\\frac{1}{N_D} \\ll \\frac{1}{N_A}$, so the term in parentheses is approximately $\\frac{1}{N_A}$. The expression for $W$ becomes $W \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_s V}{qN_A}}$. Again, the scaling is $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$. The width is determined almost entirely by the lightly doped side.\n\nThe **Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH)** model describes the process of electron-hole pair generation and recombination mediated by defects, or \"traps,\" with energy levels within the semiconductor's bandgap. Under reverse bias, the concentrations of mobile electrons ($n$) and holes ($p$) in the space charge region are much less than the intrinsic carrier concentration ($n_i$), so the recombination process is negligible. The dominant process is the thermal generation of electron-hole pairs via these trap states.\n\nThe generation current density, $J_{\\text{gen}}$, arises from the collection of all electron-hole pairs generated within the volume of the space charge region. If the generation rate per unit volume, $G$, is assumed to be constant throughout the depletion region (a reasonable assumption for midgap traps and a position-independent lifetime, as specified), then the total generation current is the rate multiplied by the charge of an electron and the volume of the region. The current density is this total current divided by the junction area, $A$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{gen}} = \\frac{q \\cdot G \\cdot (A \\cdot W)}{A} = qGW\n$$\nThis shows that the generation current density is directly proportional to the depletion width, $J_{\\text{gen}} \\propto W$.\nSince we have established that $W$ scales with the total voltage as $W \\propto \\sqrt{V}$, it follows directly that the generation current density also scales with voltage in the same manner:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{gen}} \\propto \\sqrt{V}\n$$\nFor a large reverse bias $V_R$, this means $J_{\\text{gen}} \\propto \\sqrt{V_R}$. This explains why the reverse current of a real diode does not saturate at a constant value but instead slowly increases with the magnitude of the reverse bias voltage. This increase is attributable to the widening of the depletion region, which increases the volume where thermal generation of carriers occurs.",

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe generation current density, $J_{gen}$, is due to the net generation of electron-hole pairs within the space charge region (SCR). It is calculated by integrating the generation rate per unit volume, $G$, over the SCR width, $W$. The net SRH rate per unit volume is given by $U$. Under reverse bias, the SCR is depleted of mobile carriers, so $n \\approx 0$ and $p \\approx 0$. This condition leads to $np \\ll n_i^2$, making the SRH rate negative, which corresponds to net generation. The generation rate is $G = -U$.\n\n$$ G = -U = -\\frac{np - n_i^2}{\\tau_p\\,(n + n_1) + \\tau_n\\,(p + p_1)} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{\\tau_p n_1 + \\tau_n p_1} $$\n\nThe generation current density is $J_{gen} = q \\int_{\\text{SCR}} G(x) dx$. Assuming the generation rate $G$ is approximately uniform across the SCR width $W$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$ J_{gen} \\approx q W G = q W \\frac{n_i^2}{\\tau_p n_1 + \\tau_n p_1} $$\n\nTo analyze the temperature dependence, we must express $n_1$ and $p_1$ in terms of more fundamental quantities. Using the standard definition of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i = N_C e^{-(E_C-E_i)/(k_B T)} = N_V e^{-(E_i-E_V)/(k_B T)}$, we can relate $n_1$ and $p_1$ to $n_i$ and the trap energy level $E_t$:\n\n$$ n_1 = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_t - E_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_1 = n_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_t - E_i}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n\nLet $\\Delta = E_t - E_i$. The problem states $\\Delta = +0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Thus:\n$$ n_1 = n_i e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_1 = n_i e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)} $$\n\nThe denominator of the generation rate $G$ is $\\tau_p n_1 + \\tau_n p_1 = n_i \\left( \\tau_p e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)} + \\tau_n e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)} \\right)$.\nGiven $\\Delta = +0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and for typical temperatures (e.g., $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $k_B T \\approx 0.0259\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), the term $\\Delta/(k_B T)$ is large and positive, so $e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)} \\gg e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}$. With the additional condition that $\\tau_n$ and $\\tau_p$ are comparable, the term $\\tau_p e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)}$ will dominate the sum.\nThe denominator is therefore well approximated by:\n$$ \\tau_p n_1 + \\tau_n p_1 \\approx \\tau_p n_1 = \\tau_p n_i e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_{gen}$:\n$$ J_{gen} \\approx q W \\frac{n_i^2}{\\tau_p n_i e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)}} = \\frac{q W}{\\tau_p} n_i e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)} $$\n\nNow, we introduce the temperature dependence of $n_i$:\n$$ n_i(T) = \\sqrt{N_C N_V} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right) $$\nGiven that $\\sqrt{N_C N_V} \\propto T^{3/2}$, we can write $n_i(T) = A T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right)$, where $A$ is a constant.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_{gen}$:\n$$ J_{gen}(T) \\approx \\frac{q W A}{\\tau_p} T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2 k_B T}\\right) e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)} $$\n$$ J_{gen}(T) \\approx \\frac{q W A}{\\tau_p} T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g/2 + \\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that $W$ and the lifetimes $\\tau_n, \\tau_p$ are weakly temperature dependent. Thus, the dominant temperature dependence is captured by the $T^{3/2}$ pre-factor and the exponential term. The total activation energy is $E_A = E_g/2 + \\Delta$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For a trap with $E_t - E_i = +0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\tau_n \\approx \\tau_p$, the large value of $n_1$ dominates the SRH denominator in depletion, suppressing the generation rate, and yields $J_{gen}(T) \\propto n_i\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\Delta/(k_B T)\\right)$ to leading order.**\n-   **Analysis**: As derived above, for $\\Delta = +0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $n_1 \\gg p_1$. Since $\\tau_n \\approx \\tau_p$, the term $\\tau_p n_1$ dominates the SRH denominator. A large denominator corresponds to a smaller generation rate than that for a midgap trap (where the denominator is minimal), so the rate is \"suppressed.\" The derived proportionality is $J_{gen} \\propto n_i e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}$, neglecting the weak temperature dependence of $W$ and $\\tau_p$. This matches the statement in the option.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under the same assumptions, the pre-exponential temperature dependence of $J_{gen}(T)$ inherits a factor $\\propto T^{3/2}$ from $n_i$, so that $J_{gen}(T) \\propto T^{3/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\left[-\\left(E_g/2 + \\Delta\\right)/(k_B T)\\right]$ up to weak lifetimes’ temperature dependence.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement follows directly from the analysis for option A by substituting the temperature dependence of $n_i$. We found $J_{gen} \\propto n_i e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)}$. Since $n_i \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp(-E_g/(2k_B T))$, we get $J_{gen} \\propto T^{3/2} \\exp(-E_g/(2k_B T)) e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)} = T^{3/2} \\exp(-(E_g/2 + \\Delta)/(k_B T))$. This matches the statement. The $T^{3/2}$ factor is indeed inherited from $n_i$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Traps far from midgap increase the generation current at a given temperature because either $n_1$ or $p_1$ becomes small, reducing the SRH denominator in the depletion region.**\n-   **Analysis**: The generation rate is maximized when the denominator $\\tau_p n_1 + \\tau_n p_1$ is minimized. This denominator can be written as $n_i(\\tau_p e^{\\Delta/(k_B T)} + \\tau_n e^{-\\Delta/(k_B T)})$, which, for $\\tau_n \\approx \\tau_p$, is minimized when $\\Delta = E_t - E_i = 0$ (i.e., for midgap traps). Traps far from midgap have a large $|\\Delta|$, which increases the denominator and *reduces* the generation rate. The reasoning given is also incorrect: while one of $n_1$ or $p_1$ becomes small, the other becomes large, and it is the large term that dominates and increases the denominator's value.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For silicon with $E_g \\approx 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and a trap at $E_t - E_i = +0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and neglecting weak temperature dependences of $\\tau_n$, $\\tau_p$, and the depletion width, an Arrhenius plot of $\\ln J_{gen}$ versus $1/T$ exhibits a slope approximately equal to $-\\left(0.76\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\right)/k_B$ over the measurement range.**\n-   **Analysis**: From the result in B, the dominant temperature dependence of $J_{gen}$ is given by $J_{gen} \\propto \\exp(-E_A/(k_B T))$, where the activation energy is $E_A = E_g/2 + \\Delta$. The $T^{3/2}$ pre-factor introduces a smaller temperature dependence. An Arrhenius plot of $\\ln J_{gen}$ versus $1/T$ will have a slope approximately equal to $-E_A/k_B$.\n-   Calculating the activation energy $E_A$:\n    $$ E_A = \\frac{E_g}{2} + \\Delta = \\frac{1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{2} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.76\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n-   The slope of the Arrhenius plot is therefore approximately $-\\left(0.76\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\right)/k_B$. This matches the statement in the option.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.",
