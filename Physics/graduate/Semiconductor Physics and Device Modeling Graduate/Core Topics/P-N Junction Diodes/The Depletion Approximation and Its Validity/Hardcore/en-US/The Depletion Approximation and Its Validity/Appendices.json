            "solution": "### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe derivation begins with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation, which is a form of Gauss's law for electrostatics:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_s}\n$$\nwhere $\\phi(x)$ is the electrostatic potential, $\\rho(x)$ is the local net charge density, and $\\varepsilon_s$ is the permittivity of the semiconductor material.\n\nThe net charge density $\\rho$ is the sum of charges from mobile carriers (holes $p$ and electrons $n$) and fixed ionized dopants (acceptors $N_{A}^{-}$ and donors $N_{D}^{+}$):\n$$\n\\rho = q(p - n + N_{D}^{+} - N_{A}^{-})\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge. Under the assumption of complete ionization, $N_{A}^{-} = N_{A}$ and $N_{D}^{+} = N_{D}$, so the charge density is:\n$$\n\\rho = q(p - n + N_{D} - N_{A})\n$$\nIn thermal equilibrium, the hole and electron concentrations are related to the local potential $\\phi$ through Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics:\n$$\np(x) = p_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{q\\phi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn(x) = n_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{q\\phi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $p_{0}$ and $n_{0}$ are the equilibrium carrier concentrations in the quasi-neutral bulk, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWe consider a small electrostatic perturbation $\\delta\\phi(x)$ in a quasi-neutral region. In such a region, before the perturbation, the net charge is zero: $\\rho_0 = q(p_0 - n_0 + N_D - N_A) = 0$. The potential is set to a reference value, which we can take as $\\phi_0=0$. After the perturbation, the potential is $\\phi(x) = \\delta\\phi(x)$. We linearize the exponential relations for small $\\delta\\phi$, i.e., for $|q\\delta\\phi(x)| \\ll k_{B}T$, using the approximation $\\exp(u) \\approx 1+u$:\n$$\np(x) \\approx p_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{q\\delta\\phi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn(x) \\approx n_{0}\\left(1 + \\frac{q\\delta\\phi(x)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe perturbed charge density $\\rho(x)$ is then:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = q\\left[p_{0}\\left(1 - \\frac{q\\delta\\phi}{k_{B}T}\\right) - n_{0}\\left(1 + \\frac{q\\delta\\phi}{k_{B}T}\\right) + N_{D} - N_{A}\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\rho(x) = q(p_{0} - n_{0} + N_{D} - N_{A}) - q\\left(\\frac{q p_{0}}{k_{B}T} + \\frac{q n_{0}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\delta\\phi\n$$\nThe first term is zero due to charge neutrality in the bulk. This leaves the induced charge density, $\\delta\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho(x) \\equiv \\delta\\rho(x) \\approx -\\frac{q^2(p_0 + n_0)}{k_B T} \\delta\\phi(x)\n$$\nSubstituting this into Poisson's equation, with $\\phi$ replaced by $\\delta\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2(\\delta\\phi)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s}\\left(-\\frac{q^2(p_0 + n_0)}{k_B T}\\right)\\delta\\phi = \\frac{q^2(p_0 + n_0)}{\\varepsilon_s k_B T} \\delta\\phi\n$$\nThis is the linear screening equation. It is of the form $\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{L_D^2}f$, where $L_D$ is the characteristic screening length, known as the Debye length. By comparison, we identify the general expression for the Debye length in a semiconductor:\n$$\nL_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s k_B T}{q^2(p_0 + n_0)}}\n$$\nWe now apply this result to the specified quasi-neutral regions.\n\nOn the p-side, it is a p-type semiconductor, so holes are the majority carriers. We are given the approximation $p_0 \\approx N_A$. Since $N_A \\gg n_i$, it follows that $p_0 \\gg n_0$. The denominator term simplifies to $p_0 + n_0 \\approx p_0 \\approx N_A$. The Debye length on the p-side is therefore:\n$$\nL_{D,p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N_A}}\n$$\nOn the n-side, it is an n-type semiconductor, so electrons are the majority carriers. We are given the approximation $n_0 \\approx N_D$. Since $N_D \\gg n_i$, it follows that $n_0 \\gg p_0$. The denominator term simplifies to $p_0 + n_0 \\approx n_0 \\approx N_D$. The Debye length on the n-side is:\n$$\nL_{D,n} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N_D}}\n$$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $R \\equiv L_{D,p}/L_{D,n}$. Using the expressions above:\n$$\nR = \\frac{L_{D,p}}{L_{D,n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N_A}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_s k_B T}{q^2 N_D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{N_A}}{\\frac{1}{N_D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_D}{N_A}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the ratio of the screening lengths as a function of the doping densities.\n\nFinally, we discuss the physical implications of this asymmetry for the depletion approximation. The depletion approximation posits that in the space-charge region (SCR), the mobile carrier densities are negligible ($p \\approx 0$, $n \\approx 0$), and that outside the SCR, in the quasi-neutral regions, the semiconductor is perfectly neutral. This implies an abrupt, step-like transition at the edges of the depletion region.\n\nOur derivation of the Debye length $L_D$ reveals the characteristic length scale over which a charge perturbation (such as the net charge at the edge of the SCR) is screened by mobile carriers. The potential and carrier densities transition from their SCR values to their bulk equilibrium values over a distance of a few Debye lengths. Therefore, the depletion approximation is physically valid only when the width of the depletion region is much larger than the Debye length on that side. For instance, on the p-side, we must have $x_p \\gg L_{D,p}$, where $x_p$ is the width of the depletion region extending into the p-type material.\n\nOur result $R = \\sqrt{N_D/N_A}$ shows that the Debye length is inversely proportional to the square root of the doping concentration ($L_D \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N_{\\text{doping}}}$). This means the screening is more effective (the transition region is sharper) on the more heavily doped side. Consider a one-sided junction, for example a $p^{+}-n$ junction where $N_A \\gg N_D$. In this case, $R = \\sqrt{N_D/N_A} \\ll 1$, so $L_{D,p} \\ll L_{D,n}$. The screening length on the heavily doped $p^{+}$-side is very short, making the transition to neutrality very abrupt. The depletion approximation is more likely to be accurate on this side.\n\nConversely, on the lightly doped n-side, the screening length $L_{D,n}$ is larger. The transition from depletion to neutrality is more gradual. The validity of the depletion approximation is thus most stressed on the lightly doped side of the junction. For the approximation to hold, the depletion width on that side, $x_n$, must be significantly larger than the screening length, $x_n \\gg L_{D,n}$. The asymmetry in doping creates an asymmetry in both the depletion widths ($N_A x_p = N_D x_n$) and the screening lengths, and the validity of the simple depletion model hinges on the behavior on the more lightly doped side.",
