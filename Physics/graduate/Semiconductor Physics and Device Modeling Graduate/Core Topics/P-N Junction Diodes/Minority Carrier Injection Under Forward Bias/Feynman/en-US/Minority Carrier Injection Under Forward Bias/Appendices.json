Substituting $L_p$ into the differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\Delta p(x)}{dx^{2}} - \\frac{1}{L_p^2}\\Delta p(x) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we assume a solution of the form $\\Delta p(x) = \\exp(rx)$ and form the characteristic equation:\n$$\nr^2 - \\frac{1}{L_p^2} = 0\n$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are:\n$$\nr = \\pm \\frac{1}{L_p}\n$$\nThe general solution to the differential equation is a linear combination of the two independent solutions corresponding to these roots:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = C_{1}\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) + C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the solution must be physically admissible in the semi-infinite domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. This means the excess carrier concentration must not diverge to infinity as $x \\to \\infty$. Far from the junction, all injected excess carriers will have recombined, so the excess concentration must approach zero. Mathematically:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\Delta p(x) = 0\n$$\nApplying this to the general solution:\n$$\n\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\left[ C_{1}\\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) + C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/L_p)$ grows without bound, while the term $\\exp(-x/L_p)$ decays to zero. For the overall limit to be zero, the coefficient of the diverging term, $C_1$, must be zero. Therefore, we must set $C_1=0$.\nThis simplifies the solution to:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is at $x=0$, where the excess hole concentration is given as $\\Delta p(0)$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\Delta p(0) = C_{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{L_p}\\right) = C_2 \\cdot 1\n$$\nThis gives $C_2 = \\Delta p(0)$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $C_2$ back into the simplified solution, we obtain the particular solution for the excess hole concentration profile:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = \\Delta p(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_p}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we express the solution in terms of the original given parameters, $D_p$ and $\\tau_p$, by substituting back $L_p = \\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta p(x) = \\Delta p(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{D_{p}\\tau_{p}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression describes an exponential decay of the excess minority carrier concentration from its value at the edge of the depletion region into the quasi-neutral $n$-region, with a characteristic decay length equal to the hole diffusion length $L_p$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of how bandgap narrowing due to heavy doping affects the forward current in a silicon $p$-$n$ junction. The solution proceeds by first establishing the relationship between the diode saturation current density and the intrinsic carrier concentration, and then determining how the intrinsic carrier concentration is modified by the bandgap reduction.\n\nThe total current density $J$ in a $p$-$n$ junction diode under a forward bias $V_F$ is dominated by the diffusion of minority carriers injected across the junction into the quasi-neutral regions. According to the Shockley ideal diode model, this current density is given by:\n$$J(V_F) = J_0 \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_F}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nwhere $J_0$ is the reverse saturation current density, $q$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For a forward bias where $qV_F$ is several times larger than $k_B T$, the exponential term dominates, and the forward current density can be approximated as:\n$$J(V_F) \\approx J_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis shows that for a fixed forward bias $V_F$, the forward current density $J(V_F)$ is directly proportional to the saturation current density $J_0$.\n\nThe saturation current density $J_0$ is the sum of the minority-carrier diffusion current densities at the edges of the depletion region. For a long-base diode, where the lengths of the quasi-neutral regions are much greater than the minority-carrier diffusion lengths, $J_0$ is given by:\n$$J_0 = J_{0n} + J_{0p} = q \\frac{D_n}{L_n} n_{p0} + q \\frac{D_p}{L_p} p_{n0}$$\nHere, $J_{0n}$ is the contribution from electrons injected into the $p$-side, and $J_{0p}$ is from holes injected into the $n$-side. $D_n$ and $D_p$ are the diffusion coefficients for electrons and holes, respectively, and $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$ and $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$ are the corresponding minority-carrier diffusion lengths, with $\\tau_n$ and $\\tau_p$ being the minority-carrier lifetimes.\n\nThe terms $n_{p0}$ and $p_{n0}$ are the equilibrium minority-carrier concentrations. These are the \"equilibrium minority-carrier boundary conditions\" in the quasi-neutral regions far from the junction. Under the assumption of non-degenerate statistics, the law of mass action, $n \\cdot p = n_i^2$, holds, where $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration. In the heavily doped quasi-neutral regions, the majority carrier concentrations are approximately equal to the doping concentrations.\nOn the $p$-side, with acceptor concentration $N_A$, the majority hole concentration is $p_p \\approx N_A$. The equilibrium minority electron concentration is therefore:\n$$n_{p0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{p_p} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A}$$\nOn the $n$-side, with donor concentration $N_D$, the majority electron concentration is $n_n \\approx N_D$. The equilibrium minority hole concentration is:\n$$p_{n0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_n} \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $J_0$ reveals its dependence on $n_i$:\n$$J_0 = q \\frac{D_n}{L_n} \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} + q \\frac{D_p}{L_p} \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} = q n_i^2 \\left( \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} + \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} \\right)$$\nThus, the saturation current density $J_0$ is directly proportional to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of bandgap narrowing on $n_i$. The problem provides the definition:\n$$n_i^2 = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, and $E_g$ is the bandgap energy.\n\nLet us define the case without bandgap narrowing ($\\Delta E_g = 0$) using the undoped bandgap $E_g^0$. The corresponding intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_{i0}$, is given by:\n$$n_{i0}^2 = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g^0}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nWhen heavy doping is present, the bandgap is reduced by $\\Delta E_g$, resulting in an effective bandgap $E_g^{\\text{eff}} = E_g^0 - \\Delta E_g$. The problem states that this narrowing occurs in the quasi-neutral regions, which are the source of the minority carriers. Therefore, the relevant intrinsic carrier concentration is the effective one, $n_{ie}$, calculated using $E_g^{\\text{eff}}$. According to the problem's assumption, $N_C$ and $N_V$ remain unchanged.\n$$n_{ie}^2 = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g^{\\text{eff}}}{k_B T}\\right) = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g^0 - \\Delta E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nWe can separate the exponential term:\n$$n_{ie}^2 = \\left[ N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g^0}{k_B T}\\right) \\right] \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis leads to the crucial relationship between the intrinsic carrier concentrations with and without bandgap narrowing:\n$$n_{ie}^2 = n_{i0}^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe presence of bandgap narrowing increases the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration by a factor of $\\exp(\\Delta E_g / (k_B T))$.\n\nWe can now compute the multiplicative factor by which the forward current density $J(V_F)$ increases. Let $J_{\\text{BGN}}(V_F)$ be the current density with bandgap narrowing and $J_{\\text{no BGN}}(V_F)$ be the current density without it, for the same forward bias $V_F$.\nThe ratio of the currents is equal to the ratio of their respective saturation currents:\n$$\\frac{J_{\\text{BGN}}(V_F)}{J_{\\text{no BGN}}(V_F)} = \\frac{J_{0, \\text{BGN}}}{J_{0, \\text{no BGN}}}$$\nThe problem states that carrier mobilities and lifetimes (and thus $D_n$, $L_n$, $D_p$, $L_p$) are unaffected by the heavy doping. The doping levels $N_A$ and $N_D$ are fixed. Therefore, the term in parentheses in the expression for $J_0$ is constant.\n$$J_{0, \\text{no BGN}} = q n_{i0}^2 \\left( \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} + \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} \\right)$$\n$$J_{0, \\text{BGN}} = q n_{ie}^2 \\left( \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} + \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} \\right)$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{J_{0, \\text{BGN}}}{J_{0, \\text{no BGN}}} = \\frac{q n_{ie}^2 \\left( \\dots \\right)}{q n_{i0}^2 \\left( \\dots \\right)} = \\frac{n_{ie}^2}{n_{i0}^2}$$\nSubstituting the relationship we derived for $n_{ie}^2$:\n$$\\text{Multiplicative Factor} = \\frac{n_{ie}^2}{n_{i0}^2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical calculation. The given values are $\\Delta E_g = 0.08\\,\\text{eV}$ and $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$. The thermal energy $k_B T$ at $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$ is:\n$$k_B T = (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV/K}) \\times (300\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 0.025852\\,\\text{eV}$$\nThe multiplicative factor is:\n$$\\text{Factor} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.08\\,\\text{eV}}{0.025852\\,\\text{eV}}\\right) \\approx \\exp(3.0945) \\approx 22.0763$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain $22.1$.",
