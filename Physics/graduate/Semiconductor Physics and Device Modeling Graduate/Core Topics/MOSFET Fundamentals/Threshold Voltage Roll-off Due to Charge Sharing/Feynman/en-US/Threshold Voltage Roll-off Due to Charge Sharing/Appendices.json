            "problem": "Consider a planar, enhancement-mode Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistor with an n-type channel formed on a p-type silicon substrate (an nMOS device). The substrate is uniformly doped with acceptor concentration $N_{A}$. The gate oxide of thickness $t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ has permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, and the silicon permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}$. The device operates at temperature $T$ with intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}$ and thermal voltage $V_{th} = k_{B} T / q$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $q$ is the elementary charge. Assume zero drain-to-source bias so that the electrostatics at threshold are symmetric about the channel center.\n\nUse Gauss’s law and Poisson’s equation in the depletion approximation, together with the definition of threshold based on the surface potential at the gate-center location, to analyze threshold voltage roll-off due to charge sharing. Specifically:\n\n- Define threshold by the condition that the surface potential at the channel center equals twice the Fermi potential, i.e., $\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$, where $\\phi_{F} = V_{th} \\ln(N_{A}/n_{i})$ in a p-type substrate.\n- Let the junction space-charge regions from the source and drain laterally encroach a length $\\lambda$ under the gate on each side at threshold, with channel length $L$, such that a fraction of the depletion charge under the gate is neutralized laterally (charge sharing).\n- In your modeling, regard the gate as a parallel-plate capacitor with oxide capacitance per unit area $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} / t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, and treat the depletion region under the gate at threshold as a one-dimensional space-charge slab characterized by the depletion approximation.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from Gauss’s law and Poisson’s equation, and using the depletion approximation, write the gate-voltage balance in terms of the semiconductor surface potential, oxide capacitance per unit area, and the total semiconductor charge per unit area beneath the gate. Use this to determine the long-channel depletion charge magnitude $|Q_{d}^{\\infty}|$ at threshold at the channel center in terms of $N_{A}$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}$, and $\\phi_{F}$ without invoking any shortcut formulas not derived from first principles in your work.\n2. Using geometric charge conservation arguments consistent with Gauss’s law, determine the fraction of the depletion charge under the gate at threshold that is shared laterally with the source/drain space-charge regions due to the lateral encroachment $\\lambda$. Under the stated symmetry and depletion-slab model, express the short-channel reduction in depletion charge magnitude under the gate at threshold as $|Q_{d}^{\\infty}| \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ for an explicit $f_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ that depends only on $\\lambda$ and $L$. From this, obtain the charge-sharing-induced roll-off of the threshold voltage $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS}}$ relative to the long-channel threshold by balancing gate and semiconductor charges.\n3. Justify, from the Boltzmann relation for carrier densities and the one-dimensional vertical electrostatics at the channel center, the approximation that inversion charge at threshold can be neglected for the purpose of modeling threshold voltage roll-off at zero drain bias. To do this, argue carefully from first principles why the inversion sheet charge per unit area at threshold at the channel center is a function of the local surface potential $\\psi_{s}^{c}$ alone, and hence does not acquire first-order dependence on $L$ under the threshold definition $\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$ at zero drain bias. Conclude, on this basis, the quantitative contribution of inversion charge to the roll-off prediction.\n4.

            "solution": "We analyze a planar nMOS device on a p-type substrate at zero drain-to-source voltage using Gauss’s law and Poisson’s equation under the depletion approximation. The threshold is defined by the local surface potential at the channel center satisfying $\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$, which ensures the onset of strong inversion at the center under the gate.\n\nStep 1: Long-channel gate-voltage balance and depletion charge at threshold.\n\nIn a one-dimensional MOS capacitor model at the channel center (long-channel limit), the gate voltage relative to flatband balances the electrostatic potential drop and the charge in the semiconductor via the oxide capacitance per unit area. The gate-oxide relationship per unit area is\n$$\nV_{G} - V_{\\mathrm{fb}} = \\psi_{s}^{c} + \\frac{|Q_{d}| + |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{fb}}$ is the flatband voltage, $\\psi_{s}^{c}$ is the surface potential at the center, $|Q_{d}|$ is the magnitude of the depletion charge per unit area beneath the gate, and $|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}|$ is the magnitude of inversion charge per unit area.\n\nUnder the depletion approximation, the space charge in the semiconductor in depletion is $-q N_{A}$ over a depletion width $x_{d}$, so the depletion charge per unit area magnitude is\n$$\n|Q_{d}| = q N_{A} x_{d}.\n$$\nPoisson’s equation in one dimension in the depleted region reads\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} \\psi}{dx^{2}} = -\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}} \\left(p - n - N_{A}\\right) \\approx \\frac{q N_{A}}{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}},\n$$\nsince $p \\approx 0$ and $n \\approx 0$ in depletion. Integrating twice from the edge of depletion in the bulk (where $\\psi = 0$ and $d\\psi/dx = 0$) to the surface (where $\\psi = \\psi_{s}^{c}$) gives the classical depletion relation\n$$\n\\psi_{s}^{c} = \\frac{q N_{A}}{2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}}} x_{d}^{2}.\n$$\nSolving for $x_{d}$ at threshold ($\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$) yields\n$$\nx_{d}^{t} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} \\psi_{s}^{c}}{q N_{A}}} \\bigg|_{\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} \\phi_{F}}{q N_{A}}}.\n$$\nTherefore, the long-channel depletion charge magnitude at threshold is\n$$\n|Q_{d}^{\\infty}| = q N_{A} x_{d}^{t} = q N_{A} \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} \\phi_{F}}{q N_{A}}} = \\sqrt{2 q \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{si}} N_{A} \\left(2 \\phi_{F}\\right)}.\n$$\nThis expression is obtained directly from Gauss’s law and Poisson’s equation under the depletion approximation with the threshold criterion $\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$.\n\nStep 2: Charge sharing fraction and threshold roll-off.\n\nWe now model the short-channel charge sharing at threshold due to the lateral encroachment of the source/drain depletion regions under the gate by a length $\\lambda$ on each side. At zero drain bias and under symmetry, the lateral encroachments from source and drain are identical. The depletion region beneath the gate at threshold can be approximated as a slab of width $L$ and vertical depth $x_{d}^{t}$. The lateral encroachment removes a triangular wedge of depletion charge beneath the gate from each side. The area of each wedge in a two-dimensional cross-section (length-versus-depth) is approximately $(1/2) \\lambda x_{d}^{t}$, and there are two such wedges. Relative to the full rectangular area $L x_{d}^{t}$ of the central depletion slab, the fraction of depletion charge shared laterally is\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{CS}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda x_{d}^{t}}{L x_{d}^{t}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{L}.\n$$\nThus, the short-channel depletion charge magnitude under the gate at threshold is reduced to\n$$\n|Q_{d}^{L}| = |Q_{d}^{\\infty}| \\left(1 - f_{\\mathrm{CS}}\\right) = |Q_{d}^{\\infty}| \\left(1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{L}\\right).\n$$\nThe gate-voltage balance at threshold then gives the change in threshold voltage (roll-off) due to charge sharing, relative to the long-channel case (noting $V_{G} - V_{\\mathrm{fb}} - \\psi_{s}^{c}$ is proportional to total semiconductor charge divided by $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$):\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS}} \\equiv V_{\\mathrm{th}}(L) - V_{\\mathrm{th}}(\\infty) = \\frac{|Q_{d}^{L}| - |Q_{d}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} + \\frac{|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{L}| - |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}.\n$$\nUsing the depletion reduction,\n$$\n\\frac{|Q_{d}^{L}| - |Q_{d}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = -\\frac{|Q_{d}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}{L}.\n$$\n\nStep 3: Justification for neglecting inversion charge in roll-off.\n\nWe now consider the inversion charge at threshold at the channel center. At zero drain bias and by symmetry, the electrostatics at the channel center are one-dimensional in the vertical direction. The local mobile carrier densities obey the Boltzmann relations\n$$\nn(x) = n_{i} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\psi(x)}{V_{th}}\\right), \\quad p(x) = n_{i} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\psi(x)}{V_{th}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the vertical coordinate into silicon from the interface and $\\psi(x)$ is the electrostatic potential relative to the bulk. The inversion sheet charge per unit area at the channel center is given by\n$$\n|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}| = q \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left[n(x) - n_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\\right] \\, dx,\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = n_{i} \\exp(0/V_{th}) = n_{i}$ is the bulk electron density far from the surface.\n\nImportantly, in the one-dimensional vertical electrostatics at the center, the potential profile $\\psi(x)$ is determined solely by the local boundary condition $\\psi(0) = \\psi_{s}^{c}$ and the semiconductor space-charge relation (Poisson’s equation) for the given doping $N_{A}$. In the absence of lateral fields at the center (enforced by symmetry and zero drain bias), and with threshold defined by $\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$, the local inversion charge integral depends only on $\\psi_{s}^{c}$, material parameters, and temperature, not on the channel length $L$. Therefore, at threshold and zero drain bias,\n$$\n|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{L}| = |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{\\infty}| \\quad \\text{for all } L,\n$$\nto first order in the short-channel encroachment, because the center-of-channel vertical problem is unchanged when the threshold criterion fixes $\\psi_{s}^{c}$ and lateral symmetry removes first-order $L$-dependence. Formally, one may write\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}|}{\\partial L}\\right|_{\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}, \\, V_{D} = 0} = 0,\n$$\nwhich captures the fact that the inversion sheet charge at threshold at the center is a functional of $\\psi_{s}^{c}$ alone under the stated conditions.\n\nConsequently, the inversion contribution to roll-off vanishes:\n$$\n\\frac{|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{L}| - |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = 0.\n$$\nThus, the total roll-off simplifies to\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS}} = -\\frac{|Q_{d}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}{L},\n$$\nand neglecting $|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}|$ does not alter the roll-off prediction under the given threshold definition and operating condition.\n\nStep 4: Quantifying the error introduced by neglecting inversion charge in roll-off.\n\nDefine the approximate roll-off obtained when inversion charge is neglected as\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS,\\,approx}} = -\\frac{|Q_{d}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}{L}.\n$$\nThe true roll-off including inversion charge is\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS,\\,true}} = -\\frac{|Q_{d}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda}{L} + \\frac{|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{L}| - |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{\\infty}|}{C_{\\mathrm{ox}}}.\n$$\nFrom Step 3, $|Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{L}| - |Q_{\\mathrm{inv}}^{\\infty}| = 0$ under the stated assumptions. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS,\\,true}} = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS,\\,approx}}.\n$$\nThe absolute error introduced by neglecting inversion charge in the roll-off prediction is thus\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{error}} \\equiv \\left| \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS,\\,approx}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{CS,\\,true}} \\right| = \\left| 0 \\right| = 0.\n$$\nThis zero error is a consequence of the threshold definition $\\psi_{s}^{c} = 2 \\phi_{F}$ at zero drain bias, which renders the inversion sheet charge at the channel center independent of channel length $L$ to first order, while charge sharing affects only the depletion charge partitioning under the gate. Higher-order corrections involving two-dimensional fringing fields or alternative threshold criteria (e.g., constant-current definitions) can introduce small, nonzero dependencies, but under the stated assumptions and first-principles derivation, the roll-off error from neglecting inversion charge is exactly zero.\n\nThe requested final answer is the absolute threshold voltage error in volts:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{error}} = 0.\n$$",

            "solution": "**Theoretical Derivation and Motivation**\n\nWe begin by establishing the theoretical framework for short-channel effects based on two-dimensional ($2$D) electrostatics. In a short-channel MOSFET, the electric field is no longer purely vertical. The lateral fields from the source and drain junctions significantly influence the channel potential.\n\nThe potential $\\phi(x,y)$ in the silicon depletion region (where $y$ is the depth into the substrate and $x$ is the position along the channel from source to drain) is governed by Poisson's equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nBy approximating the potential as a superposition of a $1$D long-channel solution $\\phi_{1D}(y)$ and a $2$D short-channel perturbation $\\delta\\phi(x,y)$, the perturbation term approximately satisfies Laplace's equation, $\\nabla^2 \\delta\\phi(x,y) \\approx 0$. Solutions to this equation with appropriate boundary conditions at the gate, source, drain, and depletion edge take the form of exponentially decaying functions in the lateral ($x$) direction. This motivates the concept of a natural electrostatic scale length, $\\lambda$, which characterizes the distance over which potential variations from the source/drain are attenuated. A widely used expression for this scale length, derived from a simplified analysis of the $2$D electrostatics, is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{si}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} t_{ox} W_{d}} $$\nwhere $W_d$ is the depletion width at the potential minimum.\n\nThe gate's control over the surface potential $\\phi_s$ is reduced in a short-channel device. The relationship between a change in gate voltage $V_G$ and the resulting change in $\\phi_s$ is given by the gate-to-channel coupling factor $\\alpha_G = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_s}{\\partial V_G} = \\frac{C_{ox}}{C_{ox} + C_{dep}}$, where $C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area and $C_{dep} = \\varepsilon_{si}/W_d$ is the depletion capacitance per unit area. The problem defines the body-effect factor as $m = 1 + C_{dep}/C_{ox}$. It follows that $\\alpha_G = 1/m$. Therefore, to achieve a certain change in surface potential $\\Delta\\phi_s$, the required change in threshold voltage is $\\Delta V_T = \\Delta\\phi_s / \\alpha_G = m \\Delta\\phi_s$.\n\nThe total threshold voltage reduction in a short-channel device, $\\Delta V_T^{sc}$, is the sum of the reduction due to charge sharing at zero drain bias, $\\Delta V_T^{cs}$, and the incremental reduction due to finite drain bias (DIBL), $\\Delta V_T^{dibl}$.\n\n1.  **DIBL-induced threshold reduction, $\\Delta V_{T}^{dibl}(L,V_{D})$**:\n    DIBL describes the lowering of the potential barrier at the source end due to the electric field from the drain. The change in surface potential at the source barrier, $\\Delta \\phi_s^{dibl}$, is coupled to the drain voltage $V_D$ via an electrostatic coupling factor, which we denote $\\eta(L)$.\n    $$ \\Delta \\phi_s^{dibl} = \\eta(L) V_D $$\n    This factor $\\eta(L)$ represents the efficacy of the drain potential in influencing the source-end barrier and is strongly dependent on the channel length $L$ relative to the scale length $\\lambda$. A common model is $\\eta(L) \\approx \\exp(-L/\\lambda)$. The corresponding threshold voltage reduction is:\n    $$ \\Delta V_{T}^{dibl}(L,V_{D}) = m \\Delta \\phi_s^{dibl} = m V_D \\eta(L) $$\n\n2.  **Charge-sharing-induced threshold reduction, $\\Delta V_{T}^{cs}(L)$**:\n    Charge sharing refers to the threshold voltage reduction present even at zero drain bias ($V_D=0$). It arises because the source and drain depletion regions support a portion of the channel depletion charge that would otherwise be supported by the gate. This reduces the required gate voltage to reach threshold. We can model this effect in a manner analogous to DIBL. At $V_D=0$, both the source and drain junctions are reverse-biased by the channel's built-in potential relative to the bulk, which is approximately $2\\phi_F$ at threshold. This potential difference acts like an effective \"bias\" that lowers the barrier. We model this potential lowering, $\\Delta \\phi_s^{cs}$, using the same coupling factor $\\eta(L)$ but with an effective voltage of $2\\phi_F$.\n    $$ \\Delta \\phi_s^{cs} = \\eta(L) (2\\phi_F) $$\n    The corresponding threshold voltage reduction is:\n    $$ \\Delta V_{T}^{cs}(L) = m \\Delta \\phi_s^{cs} = m (2\\phi_F) \\eta(L) $$\n    This model provides a unified description for both effects, consistent with the problem's request to express both quantities in terms of $m$, $\\eta(L)$, and the relevant potential ($2\\phi_F$ or $V_D$).\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nWe first convert all given parameters to SI units and compute fundamental quantities.\n-   $N_{A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 5.0 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $n_{i} = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $t_{ox} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $L = 30\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $V_{D} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n-   Physical constants: $q \\approx 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$, $k_B \\approx 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$, $\\varepsilon_0 \\approx 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n\n1.  **Thermal Voltage, $V_{th}$**:\n    $$ V_{th} = \\frac{k_B T}{q} = \\frac{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K})(300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.02586\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n\n2.  **Fermi Potential, $\\phi_F$**:\n    The Fermi potential for a $p$-type semiconductor is given by:\n    $$ \\phi_F = V_{th} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = (0.02586\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}}\\right) = (0.02586\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\ln(5.0 \\times 10^7) \\approx 0.4589\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n\n3.  **Surface Potential at Threshold, $\\phi_s$**:\n    $$ \\phi_s = 2 \\phi_F \\approx 2 \\times 0.4589\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.9178\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\n\n4.  **Depletion Width at Threshold, $W_d$**:\n    $\\varepsilon_{si} = 11.7\\,\\varepsilon_{0} \\approx 11.7 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 1.036 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n    $$ W_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{si} \\phi_s}{q N_A}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (1.036 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}) (0.9178\\ \\mathrm{V})}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C})(5.0 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})}} \\approx 4.873 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n5.  **Capacitances per unit area, $C_{ox}$ and $C_{dep}$**:\n    $\\varepsilon_{ox} = 3.9\\,\\varepsilon_{0} \\approx 3.9 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 3.453 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n    $$ C_{ox} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{3.453 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 0.03453\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2} $$\n    $$ C_{dep} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{si}}{W_d} = \\frac{1.036 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}}{4.873 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.002126\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2} $$\n\n6.  **Body-Effect Factor, $m$**:\n    $$ m = 1 + \\frac{C_{dep}}{C_{ox}} = 1 + \\frac{0.002126\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}}{0.03453\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}} \\approx 1 + 0.06157 \\approx 1.0616 $$\n\n7.  **Natural Scale Length, $\\lambda$, and Coupling Factor, $\\eta(L)$**:\n    $$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{si}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} t_{ox} W_d} = \\sqrt{\\frac{11.7}{3.9} (1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) (4.873 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 4.873 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 1.209 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n    Using the model $\\eta(L) = \\exp(-L/\\lambda)$:\n    $$ \\eta(L) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.209 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}}\\right) = \\exp(-2.481) \\approx 0.08364 $$\n\n**Final Fraction Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the fraction $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{\\Delta V_{T}^{dibl}(L,V_{D})}{\\Delta V_{T}^{cs}(L) + \\Delta V_{T}^{dibl}(L,V_{D})} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\Delta V_T^{cs}$ and $\\Delta V_T^{dibl}$:\n$$ f = \\frac{m V_D \\eta(L)}{m (2\\phi_F) \\eta(L) + m V_D \\eta(L)} $$\nThe terms $m$ and $\\eta(L)$ cancel, yielding a remarkably simple result that depends only on the applied drain bias and the fundamental barrier potential:\n$$ f = \\frac{V_D}{2\\phi_F + V_D} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $V_D$ and the previously calculated $2\\phi_F$:\n$$ f = \\frac{0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}}{0.9178\\ \\mathrm{V} + 0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.50}{1.4178} \\approx 0.352659 $$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures gives $0.353$.",

            "problem": "Consider a symmetric double-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) with an ultra-thin, fully depleted silicon body of thickness $t_{si}$ and uniform acceptor concentration $N_{A}$. The device has identical top and bottom gate oxides of thickness $t_{ox}$ and permittivity $\\varepsilon_{ox}$, and the silicon permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{si}$. Both gates are shorted and biased together. Compare this device against a planar single-gate ultra-thin-body MOSFET with the same $t_{si}$, $t_{ox}$, and $N_{A}$, and with its single gate oxide permittivity also equal to $\\varepsilon_{ox}$. The channel length is $L$ in both devices, and the source and drain are abrupt and identical. Assume subthreshold operation at zero drain bias, fully depleted silicon at threshold, negligible mobile carrier charge before threshold, and negligible fringing fields beyond the oxide layers.\n\nStarting from the two-dimensional Poisson equation in the silicon, the depletion approximation for the space charge density, and electrostatic boundary conditions at the silicon-oxide interfaces, use a separation-of-variables treatment to obtain the form of the longitudinal decay of source/drain-induced potential perturbations in the channel. By approximating the lowest-order (fundamental) mode as the dominant contributor, argue that the lateral decay is exponential with a characteristic length that depends on the gate configuration. Then, using a charge-sharing argument in which the threshold voltage roll-off $\\Delta V_{T}(L)$ is proportional to the amount of depletion charge effectively supplied by the source/drain fields rather than by the gate, show that the pre-exponential amplitude scales inversely with the effective oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nLet $\\Delta V_{T}^{DG}(L)$ and $\\Delta V_{T}^{SG}(L)$ denote the threshold voltage roll-off due to charge sharing for the double-gate and single-gate devices, respectively. Derive a closed-form analytic expression for the ratio\n$$\nR(L) \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta V_{T}^{DG}(L)}{\\Delta V_{T}^{SG}(L)}\n$$\nas a function of $L$, $t_{si}$, $t_{ox}$, $\\varepsilon_{si}$, and $\\varepsilon_{ox}$, under the assumptions above. Your final expression must be simplified as much as possible. Express your final answer as an analytic expression with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ratio of threshold voltage roll-off, $R(L) \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta V_{T}^{DG}(L)}{\\Delta V_{T}^{SG}(L)}$, between a symmetric double-gate (DG) MOSFET and a single-gate (SG) ultra-thin-body MOSFET. The derivation will be based on a two-dimensional electrostatic analysis and a charge-sharing model.\n\nThe starting point is the two-dimensional ($2$D) Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(x, y)$ in the silicon body, where $x$ is the longitudinal direction (along the channel) and $y$ is the transverse direction (perpendicular to the gate(s)). Under the depletion approximation and assuming a uniform acceptor concentration $N_{A}$, the equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}} $$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge and $\\varepsilon_{si}$ is the silicon permittivity.\n\nFor a short-channel device, the potential can be decomposed into a one-dimensional ($1$D) long-channel solution $\\phi_0(y)$ and a $2$D short-channel perturbation $\\phi_1(x, y)$, such that $\\phi(x, y) = \\phi_0(y) + \\phi_1(x, y)$. The long-channel potential satisfies the $1$D Poisson equation $\\frac{d^2 \\phi_0}{dy^2} = \\frac{q N_A}{\\varepsilon_{si}}$. Substituting the decomposed potential back into the $2$D Poisson equation, we find that the perturbation potential $\\phi_1(x, y)$ must satisfy the homogeneous Laplace equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_1}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_1}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation governs the encroachment of the source and drain electric fields into the channel. We solve it using the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\phi_1(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. This leads to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a constant known as the characteristic length or natural length. The longitudinal solution has the form $X(x) = A \\exp(-x/\\lambda) + B \\exp(x/\\lambda)$, which describes the exponential decay of perturbations from the source and drain. The transverse solution is $Y''(y) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}Y(y) = 0$.\n\nThe problem states we should consider the fundamental (lowest-order) mode, which corresponds to the largest characteristic length $\\lambda$, as it dominates the potential far from the junctions. The value of $\\lambda$ is determined by the boundary conditions in the transverse ($y$) direction for each device structure.\n\nFirst, we analyze the **symmetric double-gate (DG) MOSFET**. Let the silicon body extend from $y = -t_{si}/2$ to $y = +t_{si}/2$. Due to the structural symmetry and the shorted gates, the potential must be an even function of $y$. The general even solution to $Y''(y) + (1/\\lambda^2)Y(y) = 0$ is $Y(y) = C \\cos(y/\\lambda)$. The boundary condition at the silicon-oxide interface (e.g., at $y = t_{si}/2$) relates the potential and its normal derivative. For the perturbation potential, this is $\\varepsilon_{ox} \\frac{\\phi_1}{t_{ox}} = -\\varepsilon_{si} \\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial y}$, where $\\varepsilon_{ox}$ and $t_{ox}$ are the gate oxide permittivity and thickness. In terms of $Y(y)$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_ox} Y(t_{si}/2) = -\\varepsilon_{si} Y'(t_{si}/2) $$\nSubstituting $Y(y) = C \\cos(y/\\lambda)$ and $Y'(y) = -(C/\\lambda)\\sin(y/\\lambda)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} C \\cos\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{2\\lambda}\\right) = -\\varepsilon_{si} \\left(-\\frac{C}{\\lambda}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{2\\lambda}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\tan\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{2\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{ox}} $$\nFor an ultra-thin body, $t_{si}$ is small, which implies that the argument of the tangent is small ($t_{si}/(2\\lambda) \\ll 1$). Using the small-angle approximation $\\tan(z) \\approx z$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{2\\lambda}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{ox}} \\implies \\lambda_{DG}^2 \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{si} t_{ox}}{2 \\varepsilon_{ox}} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the **single-gate (SG) MOSFET**. Let the silicon body extend from $y=0$ to $y=t_{si}$. The gate is at $y=0$, and we assume a zero normal electric field at the back interface ($y=t_{si}$), i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial y}|_{y=t_{si}} = 0$. This implies $Y'(t_{si})=0$. A solution to $Y''(y) + (1/\\lambda^2)Y(y)=0$ that satisfies this condition is $Y(y) = C \\cos((t_{si}-y)/\\lambda)$. The boundary condition at the front gate interface ($y=0$) is $\\varepsilon_{si} Y'(0) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} Y(0)$. Substituting our solution for $Y(y)$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{si} \\left(\\frac{C}{\\lambda}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} C \\cos\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\tan\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{ox}} $$\nAgain, using the small-angle approximation $\\tan(z) \\approx z$ for $t_{si}/\\lambda \\ll 1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{t_{si}}{\\lambda}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{ox}} \\implies \\lambda_{SG}^2 \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{si} t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}} $$\nComparing the two characteristic lengths, we see that $\\lambda_{DG} = \\lambda_{SG}/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe threshold voltage roll-off, $\\Delta V_T(L) = V_T(L) - V_T(\\infty)$, is the reduction in threshold voltage due to short-channel effects. It is primarily caused by the reduction of the potential barrier at the center of the channel. The potential perturbation at the channel center ($x=L/2$) from the source and drain decays as $\\exp(-L/2\\lambda)$. Thus, the threshold voltage roll-off is expected to have the form:\n$$ \\Delta V_T(L) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{2\\lambda}\\right) $$\nThe problem further specifies, based on a charge-sharing argument, that the pre-exponential amplitude is inversely proportional to the effective oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox, \\mathrm{eff}}$. Let the full expression be:\n$$ \\Delta V_T(L) = \\frac{F}{C_{ox, \\mathrm{eff}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{2\\lambda}\\right) $$\nwhere $F$ is a factor related to the junction properties and depletion charge, assumed to be the same for both devices.\n\nFor the SG device, there is one gate, so $C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{SG} = C_{ox} = \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}$.\nFor the symmetric DG device, two gates act in parallel, providing twice the electrostatic control over the channel. The effective capacitance is $C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{DG} = 2 C_{ox} = 2 \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}$.\n\nNow we can compute the ratio $R(L)$:\n$$ R(L) = \\frac{\\Delta V_{T}^{DG}(L)}{\\Delta V_{T}^{SG}(L)} = \\frac{\\frac{F}{C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{DG}} \\exp(-\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_{DG}})}{\\frac{F}{C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{SG}} \\exp(-\\frac{L}{2\\lambda_{SG}})} $$\n$$ R(L) = \\frac{C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{SG}}{C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{DG}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{L}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{DG}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{SG}}\\right)\\right] $$\nSubstituting the expressions for capacitances and characteristic lengths:\nThe capacitance ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{SG}}{C_{ox,\\mathrm{eff}}^{DG}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}}{2 \\varepsilon_{ox}/t_{ox}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe difference in inverse characteristic lengths is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{DG}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{SG}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\lambda_{SG}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{SG}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\lambda_{SG}} $$\nPlugging these back into the expression for $R(L)$:\n$$ R(L) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{L}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\lambda_{SG}}\\right)\\right] $$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $\\lambda_{SG} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{si} t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}}}$:\n$$ R(L) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{si} t_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{ox}}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{ox}}{\\varepsilon_{si} t_{si} t_{ox}}}\\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the ratio of the threshold voltage roll-offs.",
