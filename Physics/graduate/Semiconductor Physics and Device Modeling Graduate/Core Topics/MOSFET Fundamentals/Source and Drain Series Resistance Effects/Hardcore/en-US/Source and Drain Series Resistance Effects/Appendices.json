            "problem": "Consider a long-channel Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) operating in the linear (ohmic) region under the gradual channel approximation. Let the device have channel width $W$, channel length $L$, oxide capacitance per unit area $C_{ox}$, and carrier mobility $\\mu$. Assume the internal gate-to-source voltage $V_{gs,int}$ and the threshold voltage $V_{t}$ define a constant overdrive $V_{ov} = V_{gs,int} - V_{t}$ along the channel. The externally applied drain-to-source voltage is $V_{ds,ext}$. Due to finite source and drain series resistances $R_s$ and $R_d$, the internal drain-to-source voltage drop across the channel is $V_{ds,int} = V_{ds,ext} - I_{d}(R_s + R_d)$, where $I_{d}$ is the drain current. Assume non-degenerate carrier statistics, drift-dominated transport, and a uniform inversion-layer charge density consistent with the gradual channel approximation. Also assume the linear-region condition $V_{ds,int} \\leq V_{ov}$ is satisfied.\n\nStarting from a charge-based drift current description and fundamental transport definitions, first derive an explicit analytical expression for the drain current $I_{d}$ as a function of the external drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds,ext}$ that accounts for the source and drain series resistances. Then, in the limit of vanishing external drain-to-source bias, compute the small-signal slope of the output characteristic, defined as $S = \\left.\\frac{d I_{d}}{d V_{ds,ext}}\\right|_{V_{ds,ext} \\to 0}$, in terms of $\\mu$, $C_{ox}$, $W$, $L$, $V_{gs,int}$, $V_{t}$, $R_s$, and $R_d$.\n\nProvide your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $S$. No numerical substitution is required. If you choose to interpret $S$ physically, it has the dimension of conductance; however, the final answer must be given as a symbolic expression without units. Do not round. Express any composite constants symbolically and avoid introducing new undefined symbols beyond those specified.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the small-signal slope of the output characteristic, $S = \\left.\\frac{d I_{d}}{d V_{ds,ext}}\\right|_{V_{ds,ext} \\to 0}$, for a long-channel MOSFET operating in the linear region, including the effects of source and drain series resistances. The derivation will proceed in two stages as requested: first, an explicit expression for the drain current $I_{d}$ will be derived, and second, this expression will be differentiated and evaluated in the specified limit.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental description of drift current within the gradual channel approximation (GCA). The GCA assumes that the electric field component along the channel is much smaller than the component perpendicular to the channel. The phrase \"uniform inversion-layer charge density consistent with the gradual channel approximation\" is interpreted to mean that the charge is confined to a two-dimensional sheet at the semiconductor-oxide interface, but its density varies along the length of the channel as a function of the local channel potential, which is the standard GCA model.\n\nLet $x$ be the position along the channel, with the source at $x=0$ and the drain at $x=L$. The channel potential is $V(x)$, with boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=V_{ds,int}$. The inversion charge per unit area, $Q_{i}(x)$, is given by:\n$$Q_{i}(x) = -C_{ox}(V_{gs,int} - V_{t} - V(x))$$\nwhere $C_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area, $V_{gs,int}$ is the internal gate-to-source voltage, and $V_{t}$ is the threshold voltage. The magnitude of the mobile charge density is $|Q_{i}(x)| = C_{ox}(V_{gs,int} - V_{t} - V(x))$.\n\nThe drift current $I_{d}$ is constant along the channel and is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the magnitude of the inversion charge density $|Q_{i}(x)|$, the carrier mobility $\\mu$, and the magnitude of the longitudinal electric field $E_{x}(x) = -dV(x)/dx$. For an n-channel device, electrons drift from source to drain, constituting a conventional current from drain to source.\n$$I_{d} = W |Q_{i}(x)| \\mu E_{x}(x) = W [C_{ox}(V_{gs,int} - V_{t} - V(x))] \\mu \\left(-\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right)$$\nThe standard convention is to define $I_d$ as positive flowing from drain to source, so we have:\n$$I_{d} = W \\mu C_{ox} (V_{gs,int} - V_{t} - V(x)) \\frac{dV}{dx}$$\nTo find the total current, this differential equation is integrated along the channel length from $x=0$ to $x=L$, which corresponds to the potential changing from $V=0$ to $V=V_{ds,int}$.\n$$I_{d} \\int_{0}^{L} dx = W \\mu C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{V_{ds,int}} (V_{gs,int} - V_{t} - V) dV$$\n$$I_{d}L = W \\mu C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{gs,int} - V_{t})V - \\frac{V^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{V_{ds,int}}$$\n$$I_{d} = \\frac{W \\mu C_{ox}}{L} \\left[ (V_{gs,int} - V_{t})V_{ds,int} - \\frac{V_{ds,int}^{2}}{2} \\right]$$\nLet's define the device transconductance parameter $\\beta = \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$ and the overdrive voltage $V_{ov} = V_{gs,int} - V_{t}$. The ideal current is:\n$$I_{d} = \\beta \\left( V_{ov}V_{ds,int} - \\frac{V_{ds,int}^{2}}{2} \\right)$$\nThis equation does not account for the series resistances $R_s$ and $R_d$. The problem provides the relationship between the internal drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds,int}$ and the externally applied voltage $V_{ds,ext}$:\n$$V_{ds,int} = V_{ds,ext} - I_{d}(R_s + R_d)$$\nLet $R_{sd} = R_s + R_d$. Substituting this into the current equation gives an implicit equation for $I_{d}$:\n$$I_{d} = \\beta \\left[ V_{ov}(V_{ds,ext} - I_{d}R_{sd}) - \\frac{(V_{ds,ext} - I_{d}R_{sd})^{2}}{2} \\right]$$\nTo find the explicit expression for $I_{d}$, we rearrange this into a quadratic equation of the form $AI_{d}^{2} + BI_{d} + C = 0$.\n$$I_{d} = \\beta \\left[ V_{ov}V_{ds,ext} - V_{ov}I_{d}R_{sd} - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{ds,ext}^{2} - 2V_{ds,ext}I_{d}R_{sd} + I_{d}^{2}R_{sd}^{2}) \\right]$$\n$$I_{d} = \\beta V_{ov}V_{ds,ext} - \\beta V_{ov}I_{d}R_{sd} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}V_{ds,ext}^{2} + \\beta V_{ds,ext}I_{d}R_{sd} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}I_{d}^{2}R_{sd}^{2}$$\nCollecting terms:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\beta R_{sd}^{2}}{2}\\right)I_{d}^{2} + \\left(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov} - \\beta R_{sd}V_{ds,ext}\\right)I_{d} - \\left(\\beta V_{ov}V_{ds,ext} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}V_{ds,ext}^{2}\\right) = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula $I_{d} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^{2}-4AC}}{2A}$, with:\n$A = \\frac{\\beta R_{sd}^{2}}{2}$, $B = 1 + \\beta R_{sd}(V_{ov} - V_{ds,ext})$, and $C = -\\beta V_{ds,ext}(V_{ov} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{ds,ext})$.\nThe discriminant is $B^{2} - 4AC = (1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov})^{2} - 2\\beta R_{sd}V_{ds,ext}$.\n$$I_{d} = \\frac{-\\left(1 + \\beta R_{sd}(V_{ov} - V_{ds,ext})\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov})^{2} - 2\\beta R_{sd}V_{ds,ext}}}{\\beta R_{sd}^{2}}$$\nWe must choose the physically correct root. As $V_{ds,ext} \\to 0$, we expect $I_{d} \\to 0$. In this limit, the numerator becomes $-(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}) \\pm \\sqrt{(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov})^{2}} = -(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}) \\pm (1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov})$. The choice of the '+' sign yields a numerator of $0$, while the '-' sign yields a non-zero result. Thus, we must select the '+' sign.\nThe explicit expression for the drain current is:\n$$I_{d}(V_{ds,ext}) = \\frac{-(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov} - \\beta R_{sd}V_{ds,ext}) + \\sqrt{(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov})^{2} - 2\\beta R_{sd}V_{ds,ext}}}{\\beta R_{sd}^{2}}$$\nThis concludes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we compute the small-signal slope $S = \\left.\\frac{d I_{d}}{d V_{ds,ext}}\\right|_{V_{ds,ext} \\to 0}$. We differentiate the expression for $I_{d}(V_{ds,ext})$ with respect to $V_{ds,ext}$. Let $K_{1} = 1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}$ and $K_{2} = \\beta R_{sd}$ for notational clarity.\n$$I_{d} = \\frac{-K_{1} + K_{2}V_{ds,ext} + \\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} - 2K_{2}V_{ds,ext}}}{K_{2}R_{sd}}$$\n$$\\frac{dI_{d}}{dV_{ds,ext}} = \\frac{1}{K_{2}R_{sd}} \\left[ K_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}(K_{1}^{2} - 2K_{2}V_{ds,ext})^{-1/2}(-2K_{2}) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dI_{d}}{dV_{ds,ext}} = \\frac{K_{2}}{K_{2}R_{sd}} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K_{1}^{2} - 2K_{2}V_{ds,ext}}} \\right] = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\left[ 1 - (K_{1}^{2} - 2K_{2}V_{ds,ext})^{-1/2} \\right]$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative in the limit $V_{ds,ext} \\to 0$:\n$$S = \\lim_{V_{ds,ext} \\to 0} \\frac{dI_{d}}{dV_{ds,ext}} = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\left[ 1 - (K_{1}^{2})^{-1/2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{|K_{1}|} \\right)$$\nSince $\\beta > 0$, $R_{sd} > 0$, and for an n-channel transistor to be on, $V_{ov} = V_{gs,int} - V_t > 0$, the term $K_{1} = 1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $|K_{1}| = K_{1}$.\n$$S = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{K_{1}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\left( \\frac{K_{1}-1}{K_{1}} \\right)$$\nSubstituting back $K_{1} = 1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}$:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\frac{(1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}) - 1}{1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}} = \\frac{1}{R_{sd}} \\frac{\\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}}{1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}}$$\n$$S = \\frac{\\beta V_{ov}}{1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}}$$\nThis result has a clear physical interpretation. The quantity $S$ is the total conductance of the device at zero bias. The denominator can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1 + \\beta R_{sd}V_{ov}}{\\beta V_{ov}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta V_{ov}} + R_{sd}$. The term $R_{ch} = (\\beta V_{ov})^{-1}$ is the intrinsic channel resistance for small $V_{ds,int}$, and $R_{sd}$ is the total series resistance. Thus, the total resistance is the sum of the channel and series resistances, $R_{total} = R_{ch} + R_{sd}$, as expected.\n\nFinally, substituting the full expressions for $\\beta$, $V_{ov}$, and $R_{sd}$ gives the final answer in terms of the parameters provided in the problem statement.\n$$S = \\frac{\\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{gs,int} - V_{t})}{1 + \\mu C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (R_s + R_d) (V_{gs,int} - V_{t})}$$",

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in semiconductor device physics, specifically concerning the operation and characterization of MOSFETs. The provided intrinsic current model is a standard representation that includes mobility degradation, and the effect of series resistance is a fundamental concept in device modeling. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data and a clear objective to determine the source series resistance $R_s$. The language is objective and the parameters are within a physically plausible range. Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is structured in two parts as requested. First, we derive the mathematical relationship between the measured and intrinsic normalized transconductance. Second, we use this relationship and the provided data to calculate the source series resistance $R_s$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Transformation from $\\nu_{\\text{int}}$ to $\\nu_{\\text{meas}}$**\n\nLet the externally applied terminal voltages be $V_{G}$, $V_{D}$, and $V_{S}$. For simplicity, we assume the external source terminal is grounded, so $V_{S}=0$. The measured gate-source voltage is thus $V_{GS} = V_{G} - V_{S} = V_{G}$.\n\nThe source series resistance $R_s$ is connected between the internal source node (let's denote its potential as $V_{s'}$) and the external source terminal. The drain current $I_d$ flows through this resistance, creating a voltage drop:\n$$\nV_{s'} = I_d R_s\n$$\nThe intrinsic gate-source voltage, $V_{gs}$, which actually controls the MOSFET channel, is the potential difference between the gate and the internal source node:\n$$\nV_{gs} = V_G - V_{s'} = V_{GS} - I_d R_s\n$$\nThe intrinsic behavior of the MOSFET is governed by $V_{gs}$. The intrinsic transconductance, $g_{m,\\text{int}}$, is defined as the partial derivative of the drain current with respect to this internal voltage:\n$$\ng_{m,\\text{int}} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{gs}}\n$$\nThe measured transconductance, $g_{m,\\text{meas}}$, is defined with respect to the externally applied voltage $V_{GS}$:\n$$\ng_{m,\\text{meas}} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{GS}}\n$$\nTo relate these two quantities, we use the chain rule:\n$$\ng_{m,\\text{meas}} = \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{gs}} \\frac{\\partial V_{gs}}{\\partial V_{GS}} = g_{m,\\text{int}} \\frac{\\partial V_{gs}}{\\partial V_{GS}}\n$$\nFrom the expression $V_{gs} = V_{GS} - I_d R_s$, we can find the derivative $\\partial V_{gs} / \\partial V_{GS}$. The analysis is performed at a fixed drain-source bias $V_{DS}$, but a change in $V_{GS}$ will induce a change in $I_d$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_{gs}}{\\partial V_{GS}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{GS}}(V_{GS} - I_d R_s) = 1 - R_s \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{GS}}\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\partial I_d / \\partial V_{GS}$ is $g_{m,\\text{meas}}$ itself, we substitute this back:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_{gs}}{\\partial V_{GS}} = 1 - R_s g_{m,\\text{meas}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the chain rule expression for $g_{m,\\text{meas}}$:\n$$\ng_{m,\\text{meas}} = g_{m,\\text{int}} (1 - R_s g_{m,\\text{meas}})\n$$\nThis is the classic negative feedback formula. We now solve for $g_{m,\\text{meas}}$:\n$$\ng_{m,\\text{meas}} = g_{m,\\text{int}} - R_s g_{m,\\text{int}} g_{m,\\text{meas}} \\\\\ng_{m,\\text{meas}}(1 + R_s g_{m,\\text{int}}) = g_{m,\\text{int}} \\\\\ng_{m,\\text{meas}} = \\frac{g_{m,\\text{int}}}{1 + R_s g_{m,\\text{int}}}\n$$\nTo find the relationship for the normalized transconductances, we divide both sides by the drain current $I_d$:\n$$\n\\frac{g_{m,\\text{meas}}}{I_d} = \\frac{g_{m,\\text{int}}/I_d}{1 + R_s g_{m,\\text{int}}}\n$$\nUsing the definitions $\\nu_{\\text{meas}} \\equiv g_{m,\\text{meas}} / I_d$ and $\\nu_{\\text{int}} \\equiv g_{m,\\text{int}} / I_d$, and noting that $g_{m,\\text{int}} = I_d \\nu_{\\text{int}}$, we arrive at the desired transformation:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{meas}} = \\frac{\\nu_{\\text{int}}}{1 + R_s I_d \\nu_{\\text{int}}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Source Resistance $R_s$**\n\nFirst, we rearrange the derived transformation to solve for $R_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\text{meas}}} = \\frac{1 + R_s I_d \\nu_{\\text{int}}}{\\nu_{\\text{int}}} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\text{int}}} + R_s I_d \\\\\nR_s I_d = \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\text{meas}}} - \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\text{int}}} \\\\\nR_s = \\frac{1}{I_d} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\text{meas}}} - \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\text{int}}} \\right)\n$$\nTo calculate $R_s$, we need the value of $\\nu_{\\text{int}}$ at the specified drain current $I_d = 2.857142857 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$.

The externally measured source and drain terminals are connected to this intrinsic two-port through linear, bias-independent series resistances $R_s$ (at the source) and $R_d$ (at the drain). The source terminal is grounded, and the device is driven by a gate voltage $V_G$ and a drain voltage $V_D$. Assume the intrinsic small-signal model is valid in the operating region of interest and that the series resistances are purely ohmic.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) and the small-signal definitions of transconductance and drain conductance, derive the linearized relationships among small changes $dI_D$, $dV_G$, and $dV_D$ at a fixed bias point, and obtain expressions for the extrinsic transconductance $g_m^{ext} = \\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_G\\right)_{V_D}$ and the extrinsic drain conductance $g_d^{ext} = \\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D\\right)_{V_G}$ as functions of $g_m$, $g_{ds}$, $R_s$, and $R_d$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information for a complete solution. The following steps derive the required expressions and evaluate the given statements based on them.\n\n**Derivation of Extrinsic Parameters**\n\nThe relationship between the external (applied) voltages and the internal voltages across the intrinsic transistor is determined by the voltage drops across the series resistances $R_s$ and $R_d$. Assuming the gate current is zero ($I_G=0$), the source and drain currents are equal, $I_S = I_D$.\n\nUsing Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), we relate the internal node voltages to the external ones. The external source terminal is grounded.\nThe voltage at the internal source node, $V_{S,int}$, is given by the voltage drop across $R_s$:\n$$V_{S,int} = I_D R_s$$\nThe internal gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS,int}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{GS,int} = V_G - V_{S,int} = V_G - I_D R_s$$\nThe voltage at the internal drain node, $V_{D,int}$, is given by the external drain voltage minus the drop across $R_d$:\n$$V_{D,int} = V_D - I_D R_d$$\nThe internal drain-to-source voltage, $V_{DS,int}$, is then:\n$$V_{DS,int} = V_{D,int} - V_{S,int} = (V_D - I_D R_d) - I_D R_s = V_D - I_D(R_s + R_d)$$\n\nFor a small-signal analysis around a fixed bias point, we take the total differentials of these relationships:\n$$dV_{GS,int} = dV_G - R_s dI_D$$\n$$dV_{DS,int} = dV_D - (R_s + R_d)dI_D$$\n\nThe small-signal response of the intrinsic transistor is given by:\n$$dI_D = g_m dV_{GS,int} + g_{ds} dV_{DS,int}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $dV_{GS,int}$ and $dV_{DS,int}$ into the intrinsic device equation:\n$$dI_D = g_m (dV_G - R_s dI_D) + g_{ds} (dV_D - (R_s + R_d)dI_D)$$\n\nWe now solve for $dI_D$:\n$$dI_D = g_m dV_G - g_m R_s dI_D + g_{ds} dV_D - g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)dI_D$$\n$$dI_D + g_m R_s dI_D + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)dI_D = g_m dV_G + g_{ds} dV_D$$\n$$dI_D [1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)] = g_m dV_G + g_{ds} dV_D$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can write $dI_D$ as a function of the independent small-signal voltages $dV_G$ and $dV_D$:\n$$dI_D = \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)} dV_G + \\frac{g_{ds}}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)} dV_D$$\n\nBy definition, the extrinsic transconductance is $g_m^{ext} = \\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_G\\right)_{V_D}$, which corresponds to setting $dV_D=0$:\n$$g_m^{ext} = \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)}$$\n\nSimilarly, the extrinsic drain conductance is $g_d^{ext} = \\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D\\right)_{V_G}$, which corresponds to setting $dV_G=0$:\n$$g_d^{ext} = \\frac{g_{ds}}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)}$$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The extrinsic transconductance at fixed applied drain voltage is $$g_m^{ext} = \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)}$$ and the extrinsic drain conductance at fixed applied gate voltage is $$g_d^{ext} = \\frac{g_{ds}}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)}.$$**\nThe expressions provided in this option are identical to the ones derived above from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $R_d$ increases while $R_s$ remains small, $g_m^{ext}$ is unchanged, because the drain-side voltage drop does not feed back to the gate-controlled current.**\nLet's examine the derived expression for $g_m^{ext}$. The drain resistance $R_d$ appears in the denominator in the term $g_{ds}(R_s+R_d)$. If $R_d$ increases and $g_{ds} > 0$, the denominator will increase, causing $g_m^{ext}$ to decrease. The statement that $g_m^{ext}$ is unchanged is only true in the specific case where $g_{ds} = 0$. Since the problem allows for $g_{ds} \\ge 0$, this statement is not generally true. The physical reasoning is also flawed; a change in $R_d$ affects $V_{DS,int}$, which in turn affects $I_D$ (if $g_{ds} > 0$), and this change in $I_D$ then affects $V_{GS,int}$ via the voltage drop across $R_s$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the linearized model with $R_s > 0$, $R_d > 0$, $g_m > 0$, and $g_{ds} \\ge 0$, the measured differential output conductance $\\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D\\right)_{V_G}$ cannot be negative; any observed negative slope in $I_D$–$V_D$ must originate from bias-dependent elements (for example, $R_s(I_D)$ or self-heating) or a true intrinsic regime with $g_{ds} < 0$.**\nThe measured differential output conductance is $g_d^{ext}$. The derived expression is $g_d^{ext} = \\frac{g_{ds}}{1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d)}$. Given the conditions $g_m > 0$, $g_{ds} \\ge 0$, $R_s > 0$, and $R_d > 0$, the numerator $g_{ds}$ is non-negative. The denominator is $1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s+R_d)$. Since $g_m R_s > 0$ and $g_{ds}(R_s+R_d) \\ge 0$, the denominator is strictly greater than $1$. Therefore, $g_d^{ext}$ must be greater than or equal to $0$. It cannot be negative. The second part of the statement correctly concludes that observing a negative differential conductance would require physical effects beyond the scope of this simplified model, such as self-heating, bias-dependent resistances, or an intrinsic negative differential conductance mechanism.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Asymmetry $R_s \\gg R_d$ suppresses $g_m^{ext}$ more strongly than $R_d \\gg R_s$, and $R_d$ affects $g_m^{ext}$ only through coupling via the intrinsic $g_{ds}$; therefore, the impact of $R_d$ on $g_m^{ext}$ is larger at low $V_{DS,int}$ where $g_{ds}$ is high.**\nLet's analyze the denominator $D = 1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}(R_s + R_d) = 1 + (g_m+g_{ds})R_s + g_{ds}R_d$. The parameter $R_s$ is multiplied by $(g_m+g_{ds})$, while $R_d$ is multiplied only by $g_{ds}$. Since $g_m \\gg g_{ds}$ in a typical transistor, the denominator is far more sensitive to $R_s$ than to $R_d$. For a fixed total resistance $R_{tot} = R_s+R_d$, the denominator $D = 1 + g_m R_s + g_{ds}R_{tot}$ is maximized when $R_s$ is maximized (i.e., $R_s \\approx R_{tot}, R_d \\approx 0$). A larger denominator leads to a smaller $g_m^{ext}$, so $g_m^{ext}$ is suppressed more strongly when the resistance is concentrated at the source ($R_s \\gg R_d$). This is the effect of source degeneration. The statement that $R_d$ affects $g_m^{ext}$ only via $g_{ds}$ is clear from the term $g_{ds}R_d$ in the denominator. The impact of $R_d$ is proportional to $g_{ds}$. For a typical FET, $g_{ds}$ is highest in the linear (triode) region, which occurs at low $V_{DS,int}$, and decreases in saturation. Thus, the impact of $R_d$ on $g_m^{ext}$ is indeed larger where $g_{ds}$ is high. All parts of this statement are physically and mathematically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Even with constant, linear $R_s$ and $R_d$, sufficiently large $R_s$ relative to $R_d$ can produce an apparent negative differential conductance $\\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D\\right)_{V_G} < 0$ in the measured $I_D$–$V_D$, because the decrease of $V_{GS,int}$ with increasing $V_D$ always dominates the increase of $V_{DS,int}$.**\nThis statement directly contradicts the conclusion of option C. As proven in the analysis for C, $g_d^{ext} = \\left(\\partial I_D / \\partial V_D\\right)_{V_G}$ cannot be negative under the given model assumptions, regardless of the values of $R_s$ and $R_d$ (as long as they are positive). The physical reasoning provided is incorrect; our mathematical analysis showed that the negative feedback effect on $V_{GS,int}$ is not strong enough to overcome the positive drive from $V_{DS,int}$ to cause a net decrease in current. Specifically, it would require $g_{ds} < 0$, which is excluded by the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
