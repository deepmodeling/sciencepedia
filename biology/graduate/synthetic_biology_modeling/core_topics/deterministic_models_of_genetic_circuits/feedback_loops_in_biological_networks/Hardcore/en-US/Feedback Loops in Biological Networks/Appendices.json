It is a valid, well-posed, and standard problem in the field of quantitative biology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first establishing the general condition for steady states, then proving the existence and uniqueness of a positive steady state, and finally solving for this steady state in the specialized noncooperative case.\n\nA steady state of a dynamical system is a state where the system variables do not change over time. For the given system, the steady-state concentration, denoted as $x^{*}$, is the value of $x$ for which the rate of change $\\dot{x}$ is zero.\n$$\n\\dot{x} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the given ODE, the steady-state condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (x^{*}/K)^{n}} - \\beta x^{*} = 0\n$$\nThis equation implicitly defines the steady-state concentration $x^{*}$. It can be rewritten by equating the protein synthesis rate to the protein loss rate:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (x^{*}/K)^{n}} = \\beta x^{*}\n$$\n\nTo determine if a unique positive steady state exists, we analyze the intersection of two functions of $x$ for $x > 0$: the production rate function, $P(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (x/K)^{n}}$, and the degradation rate function, $D(x) = \\beta x$. A steady state $x^{*}$ corresponds to a point where $P(x^{*}) = D(x^{*})$.\n\nWe analyze the properties of these two functions for $x \\geq 0$:\n\n1.  **Production Rate, $P(x)$:**\n    -   At $x=0$, the production rate is maximal: $P(0) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + 0} = \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $P(0) > 0$.\n    -   $P(x)$ is a continuous function for all $x \\geq 0$.\n    -   For $x > 0$, $P(x)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function. As $x$ increases, the term $(x/K)^{n}$ increases (since $K>0, n \\geq 1$), which increases the denominator $1+(x/K)^n$. Consequently, the fraction $P(x)$ decreases.\n    -   In the limit as $x \\to \\infty$, the denominator grows without bound, so the production rate approaches zero: $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} P(x) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Degradation Rate, $D(x)$:**\n    -   At $x=0$, the degradation rate is zero: $D(0) = \\beta \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    -   $D(x)$ is a continuous function for all $x \\geq 0$.\n    -   For $x > 0$, $D(x)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function. It represents a straight line passing through the origin with a positive slope $\\beta$.\n\nBy comparing the two functions:\n-   At $x=0$, we have $P(0) = \\alpha$ and $D(0) = 0$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, we have $P(0) > D(0)$.\n-   As $x \\to \\infty$, we have $P(x) \\to 0$ and $D(x) \\to \\infty$. Therefore, for a sufficiently large value of $x$, we must have $D(x) > P(x)$.\n\nSince both $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ are continuous functions, and the function $f(x) = P(x) - D(x)$ changes sign from positive at $x=0$ to negative for large $x$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there must be at least one root $x^{*} > 0$ where $f(x^{*}) = 0$, or $P(x^{*}) = D(x^{*})$.\n\nTo prove uniqueness, we observe that $P(x)$ is strictly decreasing for $x > 0$, while $D(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x > 0$. A strictly decreasing function and a strictly increasing function can intersect at most once for $x > 0$. Therefore, the positive steady state $x^{*}$ is unique. This holds for all $\\alpha>0$, $\\beta>0$, $K>0$, and $n\\geq 1$.\n\nNext, we specialize to the noncooperative case, where the Hill coefficient $n=1$. The steady-state equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^{*}/K} - \\beta x^{*} = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $x^{*}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\beta x^{*} \\left(1 + \\frac{x^{*}}{K}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = \\beta x^{*} + \\frac{\\beta}{K} (x^{*})^{2}\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in the variable $x^{*}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{K} (x^{*})^{2} + \\beta x^{*} - \\alpha = 0\n$$\nWe use the quadratic formula, $x^{*} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a = \\frac{\\beta}{K}$, $b = \\beta$, and $c = -\\alpha$.\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{-\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{K}\\right)(-\\alpha)}}{2\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{K}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{-\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}}}{\\frac{2\\beta}{K}}\n$$\nSince protein concentration $x^{*}$ must be a positive physical quantity, we must choose the positive root (the '-' sign would yield a negative value).\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{-\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2 + \\frac{4\\alpha\\beta}{K}}}{\\frac{2\\beta}{K}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out $\\beta$ from the square root term:\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{-\\beta + \\sqrt{\\beta^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}\\right)}}{\\frac{2\\beta}{K}} = \\frac{-\\beta + \\beta\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}}}{\\frac{2\\beta}{K}}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\beta$ (since $\\beta > 0$):\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}}}{\\frac{2}{K}}\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{K}{2}$ gives the final explicit expression for $x^{*}$ when $n=1$:\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{K}{2} \\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we analyze the dependence of the steady state $x^{*}$ on the parameters.\nIn the general case, from the graphical analysis, we can deduce:\n- Increasing $\\alpha$ (maximum production) shifts the $P(x)$ curve up, increasing the intersection point $x^{*}$. So $x^{*}$ is an increasing function of $\\alpha$.\n- Increasing $\\beta$ (loss rate) increases the slope of the $D(x)$ line, decreasing the intersection point $x^{*}$. So $x^{*}$ is a decreasing function of $\\beta$.\n- Increasing $K$ (repression threshold) weakens the repression for a given $x$, which means $P(x)$ increases for any $x>0$. This shifts the $P(x)$ curve up, increasing the intersection point $x^{*}$. So $x^{*}$ is an increasing function of $K$.\n- The Hill coefficient $n$ controls the steepness of the repression. Increasing $n$ makes the feedback more switch-like. For $x  K$, increasing $n$ raises the production curve $P(x)$, while for $x > K$, it lowers it. Its effect on $x^*$ thus depends on the other parameters.\n\nFor the noncooperative case $n=1$, we can verify these dependencies from the explicit solution:\n$$\nx^{*} = \\frac{K}{2} \\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha}{\\beta K}}\\right)\n$$\n- As $\\alpha$ increases, the term under the square root increases, so $x^{*}$ increases.\n- As $\\beta$ increases, the term under the square root decreases, so $x^{*}$ decreases.\n- As $K$ increases, the dependence is more complex. Let $f(K) = x^{*}$. The derivative $\\frac{df}{dK}$ can be shown to be always positive for positive parameters, so $x^{*}$ is an increasing function of $K$.\nThese explicit dependencies for $n=1$ confirm the conclusions from the general graphical argument.",

Substituting this into equation (2) gives $0 = \\mu(y_{\\mathrm{ref}}-y_{\\mathrm{ref}}) - \\lambda I_{ss}$, which implies $\\lambda I_{ss} = 0$. Since $\\lambda$ is a physical leak rate, we assume $\\lambda \\neq 0$, so $I_{ss}=0$. Substituting $y_{ss}=y_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $I_{ss}=0$, and $\\delta=0$ into equation (1) gives $0 = r_0 + k(0) - \\gamma y_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, which yields $y_{\\mathrm{ref}} = r_0/\\gamma$. This is consistent with the value derived from Circuit A.\n\nNow, we solve for the steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{INT}} = y_{ss} - y_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ for a general $\\delta$. We can express $y_{ss}$ as $y_{ss} = e_{\\mathrm{INT}} + y_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Substituting this into the steady-state equations:\nFrom equation (2):\n$$\n0 = \\mu\\,(y_{\\mathrm{ref}} - (e_{\\mathrm{INT}} + y_{\\mathrm{ref}})) - \\lambda\\,I_{ss}\n$$\n$$\n0 = -\\mu\\,e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - \\lambda\\,I_{ss} \\implies I_{ss} = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} e_{\\mathrm{INT}}\n$$\nNow substitute this expression for $I_{ss}$ and $y_{ss} = e_{\\mathrm{INT}} + y_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ into equation (1):\n$$\n0 = r_{0}(1+\\delta) + k\\left(-\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} e_{\\mathrm{INT}}\\right) - \\gamma(e_{\\mathrm{INT}} + y_{\\mathrm{ref}})\n$$\n$$\n0 = r_{0} + r_{0}\\delta - \\frac{k\\mu}{\\lambda}e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - \\gamma e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - \\gamma y_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\nSubstitute $y_{\\mathrm{ref}} = r_0/\\gamma$:\n$$\n0 = r_{0} + r_{0}\\delta - \\frac{k\\mu}{\\lambda}e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - \\gamma e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - \\gamma \\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0 = r_{0} + r_{0}\\delta - \\frac{k\\mu}{\\lambda}e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - \\gamma e_{\\mathrm{INT}} - r_{0}\n$$\nThe $r_0$ terms cancel, leaving:\n$$\n0 = r_{0}\\delta - e_{\\mathrm{INT}}\\left(\\frac{k\\mu}{\\lambda} + \\gamma\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $e_{\\mathrm{INT}}$:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{INT}}\\left(\\gamma + \\frac{k\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) = r_{0}\\delta\n$$\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{INT}}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\lambda + k\\mu}{\\lambda}\\right) = r_{0}\\delta\n$$\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{INT}} = \\frac{r_{0}\\delta\\lambda}{\\gamma\\lambda + k\\mu}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = e_{\\mathrm{IFFL}}/e_{\\mathrm{INT}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{e_{\\mathrm{IFFL}}}{e_{\\mathrm{INT}}} = \\frac{\\frac{r_{0}\\delta}{\\gamma}}{\\frac{r_{0}\\delta\\lambda}{\\gamma\\lambda + k\\mu}}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial perturbation ($\\delta \\neq 0$ and $r_0 \\neq 0$), we can simplify the expression:\n$$\nR = \\frac{r_{0}\\delta}{\\gamma} \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma\\lambda + k\\mu}{r_{0}\\delta\\lambda}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\gamma\\lambda + k\\mu}{\\gamma\\lambda}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\gamma\\lambda}{\\gamma\\lambda} + \\frac{k\\mu}{\\gamma\\lambda} = 1 + \\frac{k\\mu}{\\gamma\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is the final dimensionless expression for the ratio of the steady-state errors.",
