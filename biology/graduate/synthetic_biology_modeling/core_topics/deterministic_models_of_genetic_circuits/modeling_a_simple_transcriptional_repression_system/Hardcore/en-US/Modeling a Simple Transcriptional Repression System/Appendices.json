            "problem": "A single-copy gene is regulated by a simple transcriptional repressor that binds to a single operator site on its promoter.

It describes a standard, simplified model of gene regulation widely used in systems and synthetic biology. The assumptions, such as fast-equilibrium binding and first-order kinetics, are conventional for creating tractable mathematical models of such systems. The problem provides a complete set of parameters and definitions required to derive a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as laid out in the problem statement. First, we determine the promoter occupancy as a function of the repressor concentration $R$. Then, we formulate the dynamic equations for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein concentrations. Finally, we solve for the steady-state concentrations.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the fraction of time the promoter is bound by the repressor, and $1-\\theta$ be the fraction of time the promoter is free. These fractions are equivalent to the probabilities of finding the promoter in the bound or free state at equilibrium. Based on the definition of $K_d$, we can relate these fractions to the repressor concentration $R$. Let $[P_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ and $[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]$ be the concentrations of free and bound promoter, respectively.\nThe total promoter concentration is $[P]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [P_{\\mathrm{free}}] + [P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]$.\nThe occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = \\frac{[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}{[P]_{\\mathrm{total}}}$.\nThe fraction of free promoter is $1-\\theta = \\frac{[P_{\\mathrm{free}}]}{[P]_{\\mathrm{total}}}$.\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[P_{\\mathrm{free}}] R}{[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}$$\nWe can rearrange this to express $[P_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ in terms of $[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]$:\n$$[P_{\\mathrm{free}}] = \\frac{K_{d} [P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}{R}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}{[P_{\\mathrm{free}}] + [P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]} = \\frac{[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}{\\frac{K_{d} [P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}{R} + [P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[P_{\\mathrm{bound}}]$ yields:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{R} + 1} = \\frac{R}{K_{d} + R}$$\nThe fraction of time the promoter is free, and thus transcriptionally active, is:\n$$1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{R}{K_{d} + R} = \\frac{K_{d} + R - R}{K_{d} + R} = \\frac{K_{d}}{K_{d} + R}$$\nNext, we write the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the concentrations of mRNA, denoted by $M$, and protein, denoted by $P$.\n\nThe rate of change of mRNA concentration is given by its production rate minus its degradation rate. Production occurs at rate $\\alpha$ but only during the fraction of time $1-\\theta$ that the promoter is free. Degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $\\gamma_{m}$.\n$$\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\alpha (1-\\theta) - \\gamma_{m} M$$\nThe rate of change of protein concentration is given by its production (translation) rate minus its loss (degradation/dilution) rate. Translation occurs at a rate $\\beta$ per mRNA molecule. Protein loss is a first-order process with rate constant $\\gamma_{p}$.\n$$\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\beta M - \\gamma_{p} P$$\nAt steady state, the concentrations of mRNA ($M^{\\ast}$) and protein ($P^{\\ast}$) are constant, so their time derivatives are zero.\n$$\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0 \\implies \\alpha (1-\\theta) - \\gamma_{m} M^{\\ast} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0 \\implies \\beta M^{\\ast} - \\gamma_{p} P^{\\ast} = 0$$\nFrom the first steady-state equation, we solve for the steady-state mRNA concentration, $M^{\\ast}$:\n$$M^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha (1-\\theta)}{\\gamma_{m}}$$\nFrom the second steady-state equation, we solve for the steady-state protein concentration, $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$P^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta M^{\\ast}}{\\gamma_{p}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M^{\\ast}$ into the equation for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$P^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma_{p}} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha (1-\\theta)}{\\gamma_{m}} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{\\gamma_{m} \\gamma_{p}}(1-\\theta)$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression we derived for the free promoter fraction, $1-\\theta = \\frac{K_{d}}{K_{d} + R}$:\n$$P^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{\\gamma_{m} \\gamma_{p}} \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{K_{d} + R} \\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state protein concentration.\n\nThe roles of $K_{d}$ and $R$ are to modulate the level of transcriptional repression. The term $\\frac{K_{d}}{K_{d} + R}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the repressor concentration $R$. As $R$ increases, this repressive term decreases from $1$ (when $R = 0$) towards $0$ (as $R \\to \\infty$), thereby reducing the protein level $P^{\\ast}$. The dissociation constant $K_{d}$ sets the concentration scale for repression; it is the concentration of repressor $R$ at which the expression level is reduced to half of its maximum value. A smaller $K_{d}$ implies tighter binding and thus more potent repression for a given concentration of $R$. Together, $R$ and $K_{d}$ determine the promoter occupancy $\\theta$, which in turn dictates the average rate of transcription and ultimately the steady-state protein concentration.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Input-Output Function $P^{\\ast}(R)$\n\nThe total concentration of the promoter, $[D_{T}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of its two states, unbound ($U$) and bound ($B$):\n$$\n[D_{T}] = [U] + [B]\n$$\nThe probability that a promoter is in the unbound state, $p(U)$, is the fraction of the total promoter concentration that is in state $U$:\n$$\np(U) = \\frac{[U]}{[D_{T}]} = \\frac{[U]}{[U] + [B]}\n$$\nTo proceed, we express $[B]$ in terms of $[U]$ and the repressor concentration $R$. The problem provides the equilibrium relation for the cooperative binding reaction $U + nR \\rightleftharpoons B$:\n$$\nK^{n} = \\frac{[U][R]^{n}}{[B]}\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $[B]$ gives:\n$$\n[B] = \\frac{[U][R]^{n}}{K^{n}} = [U]\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[B]$ into the equation for $p(U)$:\n$$\np(U) = \\frac{[U]}{[U] + [U]\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}\n$$\nAssuming the promoter exists, $[U]$ is non-zero, so it can be factored out and cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\np(U) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the mean steady-state protein level, $P^{\\ast}$, is proportional to this probability, with a lumped proportionality constant $P_0$. Therefore, the input-output function $P^{\\ast}(R)$ is:\n$$\nP^{\\ast}(R) = P_{0} \\cdot p(U) = \\frac{P_{0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic Hill function for transcriptional repression.\n\n### Derivation of the Log-Log Sensitivity $S$\n\nThe log–log sensitivity $S$ is defined as:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln P^{\\ast}}{d \\ln R}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we can write $S$ as:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\frac{d(\\ln P^{\\ast})}{dR}}{\\frac{d(\\ln R)}{dR}}\n$$\nThe derivative in the denominator is straightforward:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln R)}{dR} = \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\nFor the numerator, we first take the natural logarithm of $P^{\\ast}(R)$:\n$$\n\\ln P^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{0}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}\\right) = \\ln(P_{0}) - \\ln\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we differentiate $\\ln P^{\\ast}$ with respect to $R$:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P^{\\ast})}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR}\\left[ \\ln(P_{0}) - \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{R^{n}}{K^{n}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $P_0$ and $K$ are constants:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P^{\\ast})}{dR} = 0 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{R^{n}}{K^{n}}} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dR}\\left(1 + \\frac{R^{n}}{K^{n}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n R^{n-1}}{K^{n}}\\right)\n$$\nNow we can assemble the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{-\\frac{n R^{n-1}}{K^{n}\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)}}{\\frac{1}{R}} = R \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{n R^{n-1}}{K^{n}\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final form for the sensitivity:\n$$\nS(R) = -\\frac{n R^{n}}{K^{n}\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)} = -\\frac{n\\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}\n$$\n\n### Interpretation of Sensitivity and System Behavior\n\nThe log–log sensitivity $S = \\frac{d \\ln P^{\\ast}}{d \\ln R}$ measures the fractional change in the output protein level $P^{\\ast}$ for a given fractional change in the input repressor concentration $R$. A large magnitude $|S|$ indicates that the system is highly sensitive to a change in the input, a property often referred to as \"switch-like\" behavior.\n\nA \"steep change\" in the input-output curve corresponds to a region where the output $P^{\\ast}$ changes significantly for a small change in the input $R$. On a semi-log plot of $P^{\\ast}$ versus $\\ln R$, the steepness is quantified by the derivative $\\frac{d P^{\\ast}}{d \\ln R} = R \\frac{d P^{\\ast}}{dR}$. Let us find where the magnitude of this slope is maximized.\n$$\n\\frac{d P^{\\ast}}{d \\ln R} = R \\frac{d}{dR}\\left[P_{0}\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-1}\\right] = R \\cdot P_{0} (-1) \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{n R^{n-1}}{K^{n}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d P^{\\ast}}{d \\ln R} = -P_{0} \\frac{n \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}}{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nTo find the maximum steepness, we find the maximum of the magnitude of this function. Let $x = (R/K)^n$. We want to maximize $f(x) = \\frac{P_0 n x}{(1+x)^2}$. The derivative is $\\frac{df}{dx} = P_0 n \\frac{(1+x)^2 - x(2(1+x))}{(1+x)^4} = P_0 n \\frac{1-x}{(1+x)^3}$. Setting this to zero gives $x=1$.\nThis maximum occurs when $(R/K)^n = 1$, which implies $R=K$. Thus, the input-output response is steepest at $R=K$. This is the point of inflection on the $P^{\\ast}$ vs. $\\ln(R)$ curve.\n\nNow we connect this to the sensitivity $S$. At this point of maximum steepness ($R=K$):\n$$\nS(K) = -\\frac{n\\left(\\frac{K}{K}\\right)^{n}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K}{K}\\right)^{n}} = -\\frac{n(1)}{1 + 1} = -\\frac{n}{2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the sensitivity at this point is $|S(K)| = \\frac{n}{2}$. As the cooperativity $n$ increases, the response becomes more switch-like, and the sensitivity at the midpoint $|S(K)|$ increases proportionally.\n\nFurthermore, let's analyze the behavior of $S(R)$ in different regimes:\n-   For $R \\ll K$, $(R/K)^n \\to 0$, so $S \\to 0$. The system is insensitive.\n-   For $R \\gg K$, $(R/K)^n \\to \\infty$, so $S \\to -\\frac{n(R/K)^n}{(R/K)^n} = -n$. The system reaches maximum sensitivity but the protein level $P^*$ is already close to zero (fully repressed).\n\nThe transition from low sensitivity to high sensitivity occurs in the region around $R=K$. The point $R=K$ is precisely where the absolute output level $P^{\\ast}$ is changing most rapidly with respect to fractional changes in $R$, and the log-log sensitivity has a magnitude of exactly half its theoretical maximum, $|S|=n/2$. Therefore, the regime of steep change in the input-output curve is centered at $R=K$, and this steepness is characterized by a large value of the sensitivity magnitude $|S|$.",

            "problem": "A simple transcriptional repression system consists of a promoter with a single operator site whose occupancy by a repressor protein concentration $R$ modulates transcription. Assume the following foundations: (i) the Central Dogma of molecular biology implies that the steady-state protein level is proportional to the transcription rate; (ii) at equilibrium, the probability of promoter states is governed by mass action; (iii) cooperative binding of a repressor oligomer of effective order $n$ yields a bound-to-unbound statistical weight proportional to $\\left(R/K\\right)^{n}$, where $K$ is the effective dissociation constant. Basal leakiness $\\ell$ represents residual transcription not eliminated even when the promoter is repressed, so that the measured steady-state output $y$ is the sum of a basal term and a repression-modulated term. You are given normalized measurements of steady-state output $y$ versus the dimensionless repressor level $r \\equiv R/K$ as follows: $r \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 10, 100\\}$ with corresponding $y \\in \\{1.000, 0.550, 0.190, 0.1089, 0.10009\\}$.

Let $k_{\\text{max}}$ be the transcription rate from the unbound promoter and $k_{\\text{leak}}$ be the rate from the bound (repressed) promoter.\n$$ \\text{Rate}(R) = k_{\\text{max}} \\cdot p_{\\text{unbound}}(R) + k_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot p_{\\text{bound}}(R) $$\nSince $p_{\\text{bound}} = 1 - p_{\\text{unbound}}$, we can write:\n$$ \\text{Rate}(R) = k_{\\text{max}} \\cdot p_{\\text{unbound}}(R) + k_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot (1 - p_{\\text{unbound}}(R)) = k_{\\text{leak}} + (k_{\\text{max}} - k_{\\text{leak}}) \\cdot p_{\\text{unbound}}(R) $$\nThe output $y$ is proportional to this rate, $y(R) = C \\cdot \\text{Rate}(R)$, for some constant $C$.\n$$ y(R) = C \\cdot k_{\\text{leak}} + C \\cdot (k_{\\text{max}} - k_{\\text{leak}}) \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^n} $$\n\nThe problem provides normalized measurements where $y(R=0) = 1.000$.\nAt $R=0$, $p_{\\text{unbound}}(0)=1$, so $y(0) = C \\cdot k_{\\text{leak}} + C \\cdot (k_{\\text{max}} - k_{\\text{leak}}) = C \\cdot k_{\\text{max}}$.\nSetting $y(0)=1$ gives $C \\cdot k_{\\text{max}} = 1$.\n\nBasal leakiness, $\\ell$, is the residual output when the promoter is fully repressed, i.e., at saturating repressor concentration ($R \\to \\infty$).\n$$ \\ell = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} y(R) = C \\cdot k_{\\text{leak}} + \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} C(k_{\\text{max}} - k_{\\text{leak}}) \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^n} = C \\cdot k_{\\text{leak}} $$\nSubstituting $\\ell = C \\cdot k_{\\text{leak}}$ and $1 = C \\cdot k_{\\text{max}}$ back into the expression for $y(R)$:\n$$ y(R) = \\ell + (1 - \\ell) \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R}{K}\\right)^n} $$\nUsing the dimensionless repressor level $r \\equiv R/K$, the final model is:\n$$ y(r) = \\ell + \\frac{1 - \\ell}{1 + r^n} $$\nThis derivation fulfills the first part of the problem's task.\n\n### 2. Parameter Identification from Data\n\nThe dataset is $r \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 10, 100\\}$ with corresponding $y \\in \\{1.000, 0.550, 0.190, 0.1089, 0.10009\\}$.\n\nAs explained, $\\ell$ can be determined from measurements at saturating repressor levels ($r \\gg 1$). From the data, $y(r=100) = 0.10009$. The term $\\frac{1-\\ell}{1+100^n}$ is very small for any reasonable $n \\ge 1$. Thus, we can approximate $\\ell$ by this value. Let's use $\\ell = 0.10$. This fulfills the second part of the task, explaining how to account for $\\ell$.\n\nNow we find the cooperativity $n$. Using $\\ell=0.10$ and the data point $y(r=3) = 0.190$:\n$$ 0.190 = 0.10 + \\frac{1 - 0.10}{1 + 3^n} $$\n$$ 0.090 = \\frac{0.90}{1 + 3^n} $$\n$$ 1 + 3^n = \\frac{0.90}{0.090} = 10 $$\n$$ 3^n = 9 $$\n$$ n = 2 $$\nThe underlying cooperativity is $n=2$. Let's verify this with the other data points.\nFor $r=1$: $y(1) = 0.10 + \\frac{0.90}{1+1^2} = 0.10 + \\frac{0.90}{2} = 0.10 + 0.45 = 0.550$. This matches the data. This point confirms that the given $r$ values are indeed based on the correct $K$, since $y(r=1)$ is exactly halfway between $y(0)=1$ and $y(\\infty) \\approx 0.1$.\nFor $r=10$: $y(10) = 0.10 + \\frac{0.90}{1+10^2} = 0.10 + \\frac{0.90}{101} \\approx 0.10 + 0.00891 = 0.10891$. This matches the data $0.1089$.\nFor $r=100$: $y(100) = 0.10 + \\frac{0.90}{1+100^2} = 0.10 + \\frac{0.90}{10001} \\approx 0.10 + 0.00009 = 0.10009$. This matches the data.\nThe data are perfectly consistent with the model $y(r) = 0.1 + \\frac{0.9}{1+r^2}$. The true parameters are $\\ell=0.1$ and $n=2$.\n\n### 3. Bias from Ignoring Leakiness\n\nIgnoring leakiness means fitting the data to a \"leakless\" Hill model:\n$$ y_{\\text{fit}}(R) = \\frac{1}{1 + (R/K')^{n'}} $$\nHere, $K'$ and $n'$ are the biased parameters inferred from the fit. The true data approaches $y(\\infty) = \\ell = 0.1$, while the leakless model must approach $0$. To accommodate the elevated tail of the data, the model must decay more slowly than the repression-modulated part of the true signal. A slower decay in a Hill function corresponds to a larger $K'$ (shifting the curve to the right) and/or a smaller $n'$ (making the transition less steep). This demonstrates, as requested, how ignoring $\\ell$ biases the parameter estimates.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A measurement taken at sufficiently large $R$ such that $R \\gg K$ isolates the basal leakiness, yielding $\\ell \\approx y(r=100) \\approx 0.100$, and fixing $\\ell$ to this value in the fit prevents offset-induced parameter confounding. If one nevertheless fits a leakless Hill model with $n' = 2$ to match $y(r=10)$ and $y(r=0)$, the inferred dissociation constant is overestimated, with $K'/K \\approx 3.5$.**\n\nThe first sentence is conceptually correct, as established in our analysis. To check the quantitative claim, we fit the model $y_{\\text{fit}}(R) = \\frac{1}{1+(R/K')^2}$ (since $n'$ is fixed to $2$) to the data point $y(r=10) = 0.1089$. The repressor concentration for this point is $R = 10K$.\n$$ 0.1089 = \\frac{1}{1 + (10K/K')^2} $$\n$$ 1 + \\left(\\frac{10K}{K'}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{0.1089} \\approx 9.1827 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{10K}{K'}\\right)^2 \\approx 8.1827 $$\n$$ \\frac{10K}{K'} \\approx \\sqrt{8.1827} \\approx 2.8605 $$\n$$ \\frac{K'}{K} \\approx \\frac{10}{2.8605} \\approx 3.4959 $$\nThe calculation shows $K'/K \\approx 3.5$. The inferred dissociation constant is indeed overestimated. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Ignoring $\\ell$ in the fit tends to underestimate $K$ and overestimate $n$, because the nonzero tail at large $R$ is attributed to stronger cooperativity that drives faster decay with $R$.**\n\nThis statement claims that ignoring $\\ell$ leads to underestimation of $K$ and overestimation of $n$. As argued above, to fit the non-zero tail, the leakless model must decay *more slowly*, which requires a *larger* $K'$ and/or a *smaller* $n'$. The reasoning provided in the option (\"stronger cooperativity that drives faster decay\") is also flawed, as a faster decay would worsen the fit to the non-zero tail.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Ignoring $\\ell$ in the fit tends to overestimate $K$ and underestimate $n$, because the model without an offset must decay more slowly with $R$ to match nonzero tail measurements; quantitatively, constraining $K' = K$ to match $y(r=10)$ yields $n' \\approx 0.91  n$.**\n\nThe qualitative part of the statement (\"overestimate $K$ and underestimate $n$\" because the model \"must decay more slowly\") is consistent with our analysis. Let's check the quantitative part. We constrain $K'=K$, so the leakless model is $y_{\\text{fit}}(r) = \\frac{1}{1+r^{n'}}$. We fit this to the point $y(r=10) = 0.1089$.\n$$ 0.1089 = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{n'}} $$\n$$ 1 + 10^{n'} = \\frac{1}{0.1089} \\approx 9.1827 $$\n$$ 10^{n'} \\approx 8.1827 $$\n$$ n' = \\log_{10}(8.1827) \\approx 0.9129 $$\nThe calculation yields $n' \\approx 0.91$. Since the true cooperativity is $n=2$, we have $n'  n$. The inferred cooperativity is underestimated. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The basal leakiness $\\ell$ can be identified from the measurement at $r=1$ because $y(r=1) = \\ell$ regardless of $V$ and $n$.**\n\nAt $r=1$, the model gives:\n$$ y(1) = \\ell + \\frac{1 - \\ell}{1 + 1^n} = \\ell + \\frac{1 - \\ell}{2} = \\frac{2\\ell + 1 - \\ell}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\ell}{2} $$\nThe statement claims $y(1) = \\ell$. This would require $\\frac{1+\\ell}{2} = \\ell$, which simplifies to $1+\\ell = 2\\ell$, or $\\ell=1$. If $\\ell=1$, then $y(r)=1$ for all $r$, which means there is no repression. This contradicts the provided data. Basal leakiness is determined from the $r \\to \\infty$ limit, not from $r=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
