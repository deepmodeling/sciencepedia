Atom conservation means that the total count of each element is the same for reactants and products in any chemically admissible reaction. Consider the following species set and their elemental compositions given by an Elemental Incidence Matrix (EIM) $M$, whose rows correspond to the elements Carbon ($\\mathrm{C}$), Hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}$), Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}$), Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$), Phosphorus ($\\mathrm{P}$), and Sulfur ($\\mathrm{S}$), in that order, and whose columns correspond to the species Amino Acid Pool (AAP), Fatty Acid Pool (FAP), Nucleotide Pool (NUP), Carbohydrate Pool (CHOP), Phosphate (Pi), Sulfate (SO$_4$), and Biomass (BM):\n$$\nM \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 16 & 10 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 37 \\\\\n9 & 30 & 12 & 10 & 0 & 0 & 61 \\\\\n2 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 4 & 23 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe Biomass (BM) column above reflects an experimentally measured elemental composition per arbitrary biomass unit: $\\mathrm{C}=37$, $\\mathrm{H}=61$, $\\mathrm{N}=7$, $\\mathrm{O}=23$, $\\mathrm{P}=2$, $\\mathrm{S}=1$.\n\nDefine the biomass reaction column stoichiometric vector $s_{\\mathrm{BM}}$ over the ordered species $(\\mathrm{AAP}, \\mathrm{FAP}, \\mathrm{NUP}, \\mathrm{CHOP}, \\mathrm{Pi}, \\mathrm{SO}_4, \\mathrm{BM})$ as\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{BM}} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} -a \\\\ -b \\\\ -c \\\\ -d \\\\ -e \\\\ -f \\\\ +1 \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $a,b,c,d,e,f$ are nonnegative real stoichiometric coefficients to be determined by enforcing atomic conservation for $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{O}$, $\\mathrm{P}$, and $\\mathrm{S}$.

Let's test $a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1, e=1, f=1$.\n- $f=1$: Correct from (6).\n- $c+e=2 \\implies 1+1=2$: Correct from (5).\n- $2a+5c=7 \\implies 2(1)+5(1)=7$: Correct from (3).\n- $5a+16b+10c+6d=37 \\implies 5(1)+16(1)+10(1)+6(1) = 37$: Correct from (1).\n- $9a+30b+12c+10d=61 \\implies 9(1)+30(1)+12(1)+10(1) = 61$: Correct from (2).\n- $2a+2b+6c+5d+4e+4f=23 \\implies 2(1)+2(1)+6(1)+5(1)+4(1)+4(1) = 23$: Correct from (4).\n\nThe solution is indeed $a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1, e=1, f=1$.\nTherefore, the biomass stoichiometric vector is:\n$$ s_{\\mathrm{BM}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n#### Task 2: Compute the elemental residual vector\nA new Elemental Incidence Matrix $M'$ is defined where the oxygen count for Biomass (BM) is $22$ instead of $23$.

It is based on the fundamental principles of mass balance and reaction stoichiometry, which are cornerstones of chemical kinetics and systems biology. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep derivation and calculation. We begin by constructing the stoichiometric matrix $S$, then use it to find the product $M S$, interpret this product in the context of elemental conservation, and finally calculate the rate of change of total nitrogen concentration.\n\nFirst, we construct the stoichiometric matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$. The rows of $S$ correspond to the species in the order $(x_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}, x_{\\mathrm{Glu}}, x_{\\mathrm{Gln}})$, and the columns correspond to the reactions in the order $(\\mathrm{R}_1, \\mathrm{R}_2, \\mathrm{R}_3)$. The entry $S_{ij}$ represents the net change in the number of molecules of species $i$ for each occurrence of reaction $j$.\n\nFor reaction $\\mathrm{R}_1$, $\\mathrm{Glu} + \\mathrm{NH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Gln}$, one molecule of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ and one molecule of $\\mathrm{Glu}$ are consumed, while one molecule of $\\mathrm{Gln}$ is produced. The corresponding stoichiometric vector (the first column of $S$) is $(-1, -1, 1)^{\\top}$.\n\nFor reaction $\\mathrm{R}_2$, $\\varnothing \\rightarrow \\mathrm{NH_3}$, one molecule of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is produced, and no other species are affected. The corresponding stoichiometric vector (the second column of $S$) is $(1, 0, 0)^{\\top}$.\n\nFor reaction $\\mathrm{R}_3$, $\\mathrm{NH_3} \\rightarrow \\varnothing$, one molecule of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ is consumed, and no other species are affected. The corresponding stoichiometric vector (the third column of $S$) is $(-1, 0, 0)^{\\top}$.\n\nCombining these column vectors, the stoichiometric matrix $S$ is:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we are asked to derive the product $M S$ explicitly. The elemental composition matrix for nitrogen is given as $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$, where the entries correspond to the number of nitrogen atoms in $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, $\\mathrm{Glu}$, and $\\mathrm{Gln}$, respectively. We perform the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nM S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting $1 \\times 3$ row vector is calculated as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (2)(1) & (1)(1) + (1)(0) + (2)(0) & (1)(-1) + (1)(0) + (2)(0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nM S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - 1 + 2 & 1 + 0 + 0 & -1 + 0 + 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nM S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the explicit form of the product $M S$.\n\nNow, we explain from first principles why the elements of this vector have the values they do. The $j$-th element of the row vector $M S$ represents the net change in the total number of nitrogen atoms within the compartment per unit flux of reaction $j$. This can be seen from the definition $(MS)_j = \\sum_i M_i S_{ij}$, where $M_i$ is the number of nitrogen atoms in species $i$ and $S_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$. This sum is the elemental balance for reaction $j$.\n\nFor an internal reaction, such as $\\mathrm{R}_1$, the reaction merely rearranges atoms already present within the compartment. By the law of conservation of mass (and elements), the total number of nitrogen atoms must be conserved. For $\\mathrm{R}_1: \\mathrm{Glu} + \\mathrm{NH_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Gln}$, the number of nitrogen atoms in the reactants is $N(\\mathrm{Glu}) + N(\\mathrm{NH_3}) = 1 + 1 = 2$. The number of nitrogen atoms in the product is $N(\\mathrm{Gln}) = 2$. The net change is $2 - 2 = 0$. This is why the first element of $M S$ is $0$.\n\nFor an exchange process, the reaction represents transport across the system boundary, which can introduce or remove elements.\nFor $\\mathrm{R}_2: \\varnothing \\rightarrow \\mathrm{NH_3}$, the reaction introduces one molecule of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ into the compartment. Since $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ contains $1$ nitrogen atom, this process increases the total nitrogen in the system by $1$ for each unit of reaction flux. This is why the second element of $M S$ is $1$.\nFor $\\mathrm{R}_3: \\mathrm{NH_3} \\rightarrow \\varnothing$, the reaction removes one molecule of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$. This decreases the total nitrogen in the system by $1$ for each unit of reaction flux. This is why the third element of $M S$ is $-1$.\n\nFinally, we quantify the nitrogen elemental-balance residual, which is defined as the time derivative of the total intracellular nitrogen concentration, $d(M x)/dt$.\nThe total nitrogen concentration is the scalar quantity $y = M x$.\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation and the fact that $M$ is a constant matrix:\n$$\n\\frac{d(M x)}{dt} = M \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem states that the species balances obey the ODE $dx/dt = S v$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d(M x)}{dt} = M (S v) = (M S) v\n$$\nWe have already determined $M S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The reaction rate vector $v$ is given as:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\\\ 4.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\\\ 1.70 \\times 10^{-6} \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we compute the final scalar value:\n$$\n\\frac{d(M x)}{dt} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3.20 \\times 10^{-6} \\\\ 4.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\\\ 1.70 \\times 10^{-6} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d(M x)}{dt} = (0)(3.20 \\times 10^{-6}) + (1)(4.50 \\times 10^{-6}) + (-1)(1.70 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d(M x)}{dt} = 0 + 4.50 \\times 10^{-6} - 1.70 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d(M x)}{dt} = (4.50 - 1.70) \\times 10^{-6} = 2.80 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nThe units of this rate are $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a formal problem in synthetic biology modeling, utilizing standard principles of mass balance and reaction kinetics. The premises are physically plausible and all required data are provided.\n\n### Part 1: General Expression and Invariance Conditions\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the rate of change of the linear functional $w^{\\top} n(t)$. The total amount of species is given by the vector $n(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$. The rate of change of $n(t)$, denoted $\\frac{d n(t)}{dt}$, is the sum of contributions from intracellular reactions and from the accretion of new volume at the boundary.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n1.  The contribution from reactions to the rate of change of $n(t)$ is given by $S v(x(t))$, where $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ is the stoichiometric matrix and $v(x(t)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}$ is the reaction rate vector.\n2.  The contribution from volume growth under the \"accreting-boundary\" assumption (where new cytosol has the same composition as the bulk) is an advective term given by $x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$.\n\nCombining these two contributions gives the total rate of change for the amount vector $n(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d n(t)}{dt} = S v(x(t)) + x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\n$$\nWe are interested in the time derivative of the scalar quantity $w^{\\top} n(t)$. Since $w$ is a constant vector, we can apply the time derivative to $n(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( w^{\\top} n(t) \\right) = w^{\\top} \\frac{d n(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{d n(t)}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( w^{\\top} n(t) \\right) = w^{\\top} \\left( S v(x(t)) + x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( w^{\\top} n(t) \\right) = w^{\\top} S v(x(t)) + w^{\\top} x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the rate of change of the linear functional $w^{\\top} n(t)$.\n\n**Conditions for Invariance:**\nThe quantity $w^{\\top} n(t)$ is invariant in time if and only if its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( w^{\\top} n(t) \\right) = w^{\\top} S v(x(t)) + w^{\\top} x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThis condition is met if:\n1.  Both terms on the right-hand side are identically zero. This is the most general condition for invariance across all states and growth rates.\n    -   The first term, $w^{\\top} S v(x(t))$, is zero for any valid kinetics $v(x(t))$ if $w^{\\top} S = 0^{\\top}$ (the zero row vector). This means $w$ is in the left null space of $S$, corresponding to a stoichiometric conservation law.\n    -   The second term, $w^{\\top} x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$, is zero if there is no growth ($\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = 0$) or if $w^{\\top} x(t) = 0$.\n2.  The two terms are non-zero but sum to zero: $w^{\\top} S v(x(t)) = - w^{\\top} x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$. This represents a dynamic balance that may hold only at specific states or for specific trajectories, but not in general.\n\n**Conditions for Broken Invariance:**\nInvariance is broken if the time derivative is non-zero:\n$$\nw^{\\top} S v(x(t)) + w^{\\top} x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt} \\neq 0\n$$\nA notable case is when a stoichiometric conservation law exists ($w^{\\top} S = 0^{\\top}$), but the system is growing. In this specific scenario, the reaction term vanishes, and the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( w^{\\top} n(t) \\right) = w^{\\top} x(t) \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\n$$\nIn this case, invariance is broken by growth, provided that $\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} \\neq 0$ and the weighted sum of concentrations $w^{\\top} x(t)$ is not zero.\n\n### Part 2: Specific Calculation\n\nWe are asked to compute the value of $\\frac{d}{dt}(w^{\\top} n(t))$ at a specific time $t^{\\ast}$. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(w^{\\top} n(t)\\big)\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}} = w^{\\top} S v(x(t^{\\ast})) + w^{\\top} x(t^{\\ast}) \\frac{dV}{dt}\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}}\n$$\nWe are given the specific forms for $S$ and $w$:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad w = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, let us evaluate the product $w^{\\top} S$:\n$$\nw^{\\top} S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (1)(0) & (1)(0) + (1)(-1) + (1)(1) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nw^{\\top} S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1+1 & -1+1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0^{\\top}\n$$\nSince $w^{\\top} S = 0^{\\top}$, the first term in the expression for the time derivative is zero, regardless of the reaction rates $v(x(t^{\\ast}))$.\n$$\nw^{\\top} S v(x(t^{\\ast})) = 0^{\\top} v(x(t^{\\ast})) = 0\n$$\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(w^{\\top} n(t)\\big)\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}} = w^{\\top} x(t^{\\ast}) \\frac{dV}{dt}\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the remaining terms using the data provided for time $t^{\\ast}$.\nThe instantaneous growth rate is $\\mu = \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dt}\\big|_{t^{\\ast}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThe volume is $V(t^{\\ast}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{L}$.\nWe can calculate the rate of volume change:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt}\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}} = \\mu \\cdot V(t^{\\ast}) = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{L}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{L} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe concentration vector is $x(t^{\\ast}) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t^{\\ast}) \\\\ x_2(t^{\\ast}) \\\\ x_3(t^{\\ast}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\nWe compute the weighted sum of concentrations $w^{\\top} x(t^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nw^{\\top} x(t^{\\ast}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\text{mol L}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nw^{\\top} x(t^{\\ast}) = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\, \\text{mol L}^{-1} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mol L}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we multiply these two results to find the instantaneous rate of change:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(w^{\\top} n(t)\\big)\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}} = (4.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mol L}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{L} \\, \\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(w^{\\top} n(t)\\big)\\bigg|_{t^{\\ast}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-17} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n8.0 \\times 10^{-17} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1} = 8.00 \\times 10^{-17} \\, \\text{mol s}^{-1}\n$$",
