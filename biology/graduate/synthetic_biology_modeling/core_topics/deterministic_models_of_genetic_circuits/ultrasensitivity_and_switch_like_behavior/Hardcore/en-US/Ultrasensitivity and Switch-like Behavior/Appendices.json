            "problem": "A gene expression output $y(x)$ in a synthetic regulatory module exhibits ultrasensitivity and switch-like behavior and is well-described by the Hill regulation function, a widely used and empirically validated model in systems and synthetic biology. Let $y(x)$ be given by the Hill form $y(x)=y_{\\min}+\\left(y_{\\max}-y_{\\min}\\right)\\dfrac{x^{n}}{K^{n}+x^{n}}$, where $y_{\\min}$ and $y_{\\max}$ are the minimal and maximal outputs, respectively, $K0$ is the activation constant, and $n0$ is the Hill coefficient. Define the normalized fractional output $f(x)=\\dfrac{y(x)-y_{\\min}}{y_{\\max}-y_{\\min}}$. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) is denoted $EC_{50}$ and is defined by the condition $f(EC_{50})=\\dfrac{1}{2}$. A principled local measure of ultrasensitivity is the input elasticity of the active output, defined as $E(x)=\\dfrac{d\\ln\\left(y(x)-y_{\\min}\\right)}{d\\ln x}$, which quantifies the logarithmic sensitivity of the active output to the input $x$. To capture how switching accelerates as headroom shrinks near saturation, consider the rescaled local ultrasensitivity $R(x)=E(x)\\left[1-f(x)\\right]$, which weights the elasticity by the remaining fractional headroom to saturation.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the Hill regulation function, derive a closed-form expression for $R(x)$ in terms of $x$, $K$, and $n$ only, showing all steps from the stated definitions without introducing any additional shortcut formulas. Then evaluate $R(EC_{50})$ for the special case $y_{\\min}=0$, and provide the final result as a single symbolic expression. No numerical substitution is required; do not round. Express the final answer as a single analytical expression without units.",
            "solution": "The objective is to first derive a closed-form expression for the rescaled local ultrasensitivity, $R(x)$, and then to evaluate this expression at the half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$. The derivation will begin from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we simplify the expression for the normalized fractional output, $f(x)$. The output $y(x)$ is given by the Hill function:\n$$y(x) = y_{\\min} + (y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}) \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}$$\nFrom this, we can express the active output, $y(x) - y_{\\min}$, as:\n$$y(x) - y_{\\min} = (y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}) \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}$$\nThe normalized fractional output, $f(x)$, is defined as $f(x) = \\frac{y(x) - y_{\\min}}{y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}}$. Substituting the expression for the active output yields:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{(y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}) \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}}{y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}} = \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}$$\nThis simplified form of $f(x)$ is independent of $y_{\\min}$ and $y_{\\max}$.\n\nNext, we derive the input elasticity, $E(x)$, defined as $E(x) = \\frac{d\\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min})}{d\\ln x}$. We can rewrite the logarithmic derivative with respect to $\\ln x$ as $x \\frac{d}{dx}$. Thus, $E(x) = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min}) \\right]$. Let's first evaluate the logarithm of the active output:\n$$\\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min}) = \\ln\\left((y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}) \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min}) = \\ln(y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}) + \\ln(x^n) - \\ln(K^n + x^n)$$\n$$\\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min}) = \\ln(y_{\\max} - y_{\\min}) + n\\ln(x) - \\ln(K^n + x^n)$$\nNow, we differentiate this expression with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min})\\right] = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\ln(y_{\\max} - y_{\\min})\\right] + n\\frac{d}{dx}[\\ln(x)] - \\frac{d}{dx}[\\ln(K^n + x^n)]$$\nThe derivative of the constant term $\\ln(y_{\\max} - y_{\\min})$ is $0$. The derivatives of the other terms are:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\ln(y(x) - y_{\\min})\\right] = 0 + \\frac{n}{x} - \\frac{1}{K^n+x^n} \\cdot (nx^{n-1}) = \\frac{n}{x} - \\frac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n + x^n}$$\nNow we can compute $E(x)$ by multiplying by $x$:\n$$E(x) = x \\left( \\frac{n}{x} - \\frac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n + x^n} \\right) = n - \\frac{nx^n}{K^n + x^n}$$\nFactoring out $n$ and simplifying gives the closed-form expression for the elasticity:\n$$E(x) = n \\left(1 - \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n}\\right) = n \\left(\\frac{K^n + x^n - x^n}{K^n + x^n}\\right) = n \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n}$$\nLike $f(x)$, the elasticity $E(x)$ is also independent of $y_{\\min}$ and $y_{\\max}$.\n\nThe rescaled local ultrasensitivity is defined as $R(x) = E(x) [1 - f(x)]$. We need an expression for the fractional headroom, $1 - f(x)$:\n$$1 - f(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^n}{K^n + x^n} = \\frac{K^n + x^n - x^n}{K^n + x^n} = \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n}$$\nNow we can combine the expressions for $E(x)$ and $1-f(x)$ to find $R(x)$:\n$$R(x) = \\left( n \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n} \\right) = n \\left( \\frac{K^n}{K^n + x^n} \\right)^2$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $R(x)$ in terms of $x$, $K$, and $n$.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate $R(EC_{50})$. First, we must find $EC_{50}$, which is defined by the condition $f(EC_{50}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Using our simplified expression for $f(x)$:\n$$\\frac{(EC_{50})^n}{K^n + (EC_{50})^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$2(EC_{50})^n = K^n + (EC_{50})^n$$\n$$(EC_{50})^n = K^n$$\nSince both $EC_{50}$ and $K$ are positive quantities, we have $EC_{50} = K$. This confirms that the activation constant $K$ is indeed the concentration for half-maximal activation.\n\nFinally, we substitute $x = EC_{50} = K$ into our expression for $R(x)$. The problem specifies this evaluation for the case $y_{\\min}=0$, but as we have shown, $R(x)$ is independent of $y_{\\min}$, so this condition does not change the result.\n$$R(EC_{50}) = R(K) = n \\left( \\frac{K^n}{K^n + K^n} \\right)^2$$\n$$R(K) = n \\left( \\frac{K^n}{2K^n} \\right)^2 = n \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = n \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$$\n$$R(K) = \\frac{n}{4}$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the rescaled local ultrasensitivity evaluated at the half-maximal effective concentration.",
