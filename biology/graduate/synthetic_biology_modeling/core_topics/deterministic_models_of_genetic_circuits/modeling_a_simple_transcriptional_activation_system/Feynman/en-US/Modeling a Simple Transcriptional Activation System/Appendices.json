The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided, and is well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The terminology is precise and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Expression for $f_{\\mathrm{bound}}$**\n\nThe reversible binding of the transcription factor $X$ to the promoter $P$ is described by the reaction:\n$$ X + P \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{\\mathrm{off}}]{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} PX $$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of change of the concentration of the bound complex, $[PX]$, is given by the difference between the rate of formation (the binding or \"on\" flux) and the rate of dissociation (the unbinding or \"off\" flux). Let $[X]$, $[P]$, and $[PX]$ represent the concentrations of the free transcription factor, free promoter, and the bound complex, respectively. The rate equation for $[PX]$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d[PX]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[X][P] - k_{\\mathrm{off}}[PX] $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state solution. At steady state, the concentration of the complex $[PX]$ is constant, meaning its net rate of change is zero:\n$$ \\frac{d[PX]}{dt} = 0 $$\nTherefore, the binding and unbinding fluxes must be equal:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}}[X][P] = k_{\\mathrm{off}}[PX] $$\nThis equation relates the concentrations of the free species to the bound species at equilibrium. We can rearrange it to find the ratio of bound to free promoter:\n$$ \\frac{[PX]}{[P]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}[X] $$\nThe problem requires an expression for the fraction of TF-bound promoter, $f_{\\mathrm{bound}}$. This fraction is defined as the concentration of bound promoter divided by the total concentration of promoter, $[P]_{\\mathrm{total}}$. Since each promoter has only a single binding site, the total promoter concentration is the sum of the free promoter and the bound promoter:\n$$ [P]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [P] + [PX] $$\nThus, the fraction of bound promoter is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{[PX]}{[P]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[PX]}{[P] + [PX]} $$\nTo express $f_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ in terms of $[X]$, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, we can divide the numerator and the denominator of the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{bound}}$ by the free promoter concentration, $[P]$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{\\frac{[PX]}{[P]}}{1 + \\frac{[PX]}{[P]}} $$\nSubstituting the steady-state ratio $\\frac{[PX]}{[P]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}[X]$ into this equation, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}[X]}{1 + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}[X]} $$\nThis equation is a form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site (Hill coefficient of $1$).\n\n**Numerical Computation of $f_{\\mathrm{bound}}$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $[X] = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$\n-   $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, let's compute the dimensionless term $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}[X]$. It is essential to ensure unit consistency.\nThe ratio of rate constants is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}{10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}} $$\nNow, we multiply by the concentration $[X]$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}[X] = (10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}}) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = (10^{10}) \\times (10^{-8}) = 10^{2} = 100 $$\nThe result is dimensionless, as expected.\nNow, we substitute this value back into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{bound}}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{100}{1 + 100} = \\frac{100}{101} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction and round it to four significant figures as requested.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{bound}} = \\frac{100}{101} \\approx 0.9900990099... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{bound}} \\approx 0.9901 $$\nThis means that at steady state, approximately $99.01\\%$ of a promoter is bound by the transcription factor under the given conditions.",

            "problem": "Consider a minimal transcriptional activation system in a single, exponentially growing cell at constant volume, where a transcription factor $X$ with constant concentration $[X]$ activates a promoter controlling expression of a protein $P$. The following mechanistic assumptions define the model:\n\n- The promoter alternates between an inactive and an active state due to binding of $X$; the fraction of time it is active is the promoter activity function $f([X])$, which satisfies $0 \\leq f([X]) \\leq 1$. The functional form of $f([X])$ arises from an equilibrium binding model but is not specified here.\n- When the promoter is active, transcription initiates with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ per gene copy, producing messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).

Identify explicitly how the promoter activity $f([X])$ scales the steady-state output. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $p^{*}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, canonical model in systems and synthetic biology for gene expression, based on the Central Dogma and mass-action kinetics. All parameters are clearly defined, and the system is not under- or over-constrained. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe task is to formulate a mathematical model for the concentrations of messenger RNA (mRNA), $m(t)$, and protein, $p(t)$, and then to solve for the steady-state protein concentration, $p^{*}$. The model is constructed based on the principles of mass-action kinetics for a well-mixed system.\n\nFirst, we formulate the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$. The rate of change of $m(t)$, denoted $\\frac{dm}{dt}$, is the difference between its rate of production and its rate of loss.\n\nThe production of mRNA is governed by transcription. The problem states that transcription initiates from a single gene copy (a concentration of $1$ gene per cell volume) with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{tx}}$ only when the promoter is in its active state. The fraction of time the promoter is active is given by the promoter activity function, $f([X])$. Therefore, the effective rate of transcription is the maximum rate multiplied by this fractional activity. The production term is thus $k_{\\mathrm{tx}} \\cdot 1 \\cdot f([X]) = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} f([X])$.\n\nThe loss of mRNA occurs through two first-order processes: intrinsic degradation with rate constant $\\gamma_{m}$ and dilution due to cell growth with rate $\\mu$. The problem specifies the total loss rate constant is the sum of these, $\\gamma_{m} + \\mu$. As this is a first-order process, the total loss rate is proportional to the current concentration $m(t)$. The loss term is therefore $(\\gamma_{m} + \\mu)m(t)$.\n\nCombining the production and loss terms, the ODE for $m(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} f([X]) - (\\gamma_{m} + \\mu)m\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the ODE for the protein concentration, $p(t)$. The rate of change $\\frac{dp}{dt}$ is similarly the difference between its production and loss rates.\n\nThe production of protein is governed by translation from mRNA. The problem states that translation occurs with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{tl}}$ per mRNA molecule. This is a first-order process with respect to the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$. The production term for the protein is thus $k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m(t)$.\n\nThe loss of protein, like mRNA, occurs through intrinsic degradation with rate constant $\\gamma_{p}$ and dilution due to cell growth at rate $\\mu$. The total loss rate constant is $\\gamma_{p} + \\mu$. This first-order loss process contributes a term $(\\gamma_{p} + \\mu)p(t)$.\n\nCombining the production and loss terms, the ODE for $p(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m - (\\gamma_{p} + \\mu)p\n$$\n\nTo find the steady-state protein level, denoted $p^{*}$, we must find the state of the system where the concentrations of both mRNA and protein are no longer changing with time. This condition, known as steady state, is defined by setting the time derivatives to zero: $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$.\n\nLet $m^{*}$ and $p^{*}$ be the steady-state concentrations of mRNA and protein, respectively.\nFrom the mRNA ODE at steady state:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} f([X]) - (\\gamma_{m} + \\mu)m^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $m^{*}$ gives:\n$$\n(\\gamma_{m} + \\mu)m^{*} = k_{\\mathrm{tx}} f([X])\n$$\n$$\nm^{*} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} f([X])}{\\gamma_{m} + \\mu}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the steady-state mRNA level is directly proportional to the promoter activity $f([X])$.\n\nNow, we use the protein ODE at steady state, substituting the steady-state mRNA concentration $m^{*}$:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m^{*} - (\\gamma_{p} + \\mu)p^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $p^{*}$ gives:\n$$\n(\\gamma_{p} + \\mu)p^{*} = k_{\\mathrm{tl}} m^{*}\n$$\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl}}}{\\gamma_{p} + \\mu} m^{*}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $m^{*}$ into the equation for $p^{*}$ to obtain the final expression for the steady-state protein concentration as a function of the input $[X]$ and the system parameters:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tl}}}{\\gamma_{p} + \\mu} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} f([X])}{\\gamma_{m} + \\mu} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the final closed-form analytic expression:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl}}}{(\\gamma_{m} + \\mu)(\\gamma_{p} + \\mu)} f([X])\n$$\nThis result explicitly shows how the promoter activity $f([X])$ scales the steady-state protein output, $p^{*}$. The protein level is directly proportional to the promoter activity. The constant of proportionality, $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{tx}} k_{\\mathrm{tl}}}{(\\gamma_{m} + \\mu)(\\gamma_{p} + \\mu)}$, is a composite parameter that encapsulates the efficiencies of all the intermediate processes: transcription, translation, and the effective lifetimes of the mRNA and protein molecules.",

Baseline Birth-Death (BD) Model**\n\nThis model assumes a constant synthesis rate equal to the time-averaged transcriptional rate of the two-state system. In the two-state model, the promoter is active with probability $p_{on} = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}$. The time-averaged synthesis rate, $\\bar{r}$, is the synthesis rate during the active state, $r$, multiplied by this probability:\n$$ \\bar{r} = r \\cdot p_{on} = r \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} $$\nThe BD model describes the dynamics of mRNA count $M$ via the reactions:\n$$ \\emptyset \\xrightarrow{\\bar{r}} M \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M \\xrightarrow{\\gamma} \\emptyset $$\nThis is a classic birth-death process, and the steady-state distribution of $M$ is a Poisson distribution.
