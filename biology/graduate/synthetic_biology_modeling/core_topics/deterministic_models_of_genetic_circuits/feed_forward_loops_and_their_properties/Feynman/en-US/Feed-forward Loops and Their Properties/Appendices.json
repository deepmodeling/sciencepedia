The ODEs are based on fundamental mass-action principles for protein synthesis and first-order degradation. The Hill functions are a widely accepted phenomenological model for transcriptional regulation. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. For a constant input $X$, the ODE for $Y$ is linear and has a unique, stable steady state. Subsequently, the ODE for $Z$ also becomes a linear equation (with a time-independent forcing term once $Y$ reaches its steady state), leading to a unique, stable steady state for $Z$. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to find a unique solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Steady-State Analysis**\n\nTo find the steady-state concentrations, denoted by $Y^\\ast$ and $Z^\\ast$, we set the time derivatives of the concentrations to zero.\n\nFor the concentration of $Y$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = 0 \\implies k_Y\\,F_{XY}(X)\\;-\\;\\gamma_Y\\,Y^\\ast = 0\n$$\nSolving for $Y^\\ast$ as a function of the input $X$ and the system parameters gives:\n$$\nY^\\ast(X) = \\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y}\\,F_{XY}(X) = \\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y} \\left( \\frac{X^{n_{XY}}}{K_{XY}^{\\,n_{XY}}+X^{n_{XY}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation provides the explicit steady-state concentration of the intermediate transcription factor $Y$ as a function of the upstream input $X$.\n\nFor the concentration of $Z$, we set its time derivative to zero and evaluate it at the steady state of $Y$, which is $Y^\\ast$:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ}{dt} = 0 \\implies k_Z\\,G_{XZ}(X)\\,H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast)\\;-\\;\\gamma_Z\\,Z^\\ast = 0\n$$\nSolving for $Z^\\ast$ as a function of $X$ and $Y^\\ast$ yields:\n$$\nZ^\\ast(X) = \\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z}\\,G_{XZ}(X)\\,H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast(X))\n$$\nTo obtain $Z^\\ast$ as an explicit function of only $X$ and the parameters, we substitute the expressions for $G_{XZ}(X)$, $H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast)$, and $Y^\\ast(X)$:\n$$\nZ^\\ast(X) = \\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z} \\left( \\frac{X^{n_{XZ}}}{K_{XZ}^{\\,n_{XZ}}+X^{n_{XZ}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(Y^\\ast(X))^{n_{YZ}}}{K_{YZ}^{\\,n_{YZ}}+(Y^\\ast(X))^{n_{YZ}}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $Y^\\ast(X)$ results in the final analytical form for $Z^\\ast(X)$:\n$$\nZ^\\ast(X) = \\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z} \\left( \\frac{X^{n_{XZ}}}{K_{XZ}^{\\,n_{XZ}}+X^{n_{XZ}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y} \\frac{X^{n_{XY}}}{K_{XY}^{\\,n_{XY}}+X^{n_{XY}}}\\right)^{n_{YZ}}}{K_{YZ}^{\\,n_{YZ}} + \\left(\\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y} \\frac{X^{n_{XY}}}{K_{XY}^{\\,n_{XY}}+X^{n_{XY}}}\\right)^{n_{YZ}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\n**2. Monotonicity Analysis**\n\nTo determine if $Z^\\ast$ is a monotone function of $X$, we must find the sign of its derivative, $\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX}$. We start from the expression $Z^\\ast(X) = \\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z}\\,G_{XZ}(X)\\,H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast(X))$.\n\nUsing the product rule and chain rule for differentiation with respect to $X$:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX} = \\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z} \\left[ \\frac{dG_{XZ}(X)}{dX} H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast(X)) + G_{XZ}(X) \\frac{d}{dX} \\left( H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast(X)) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX} = \\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z} \\left[ \\frac{dG_{XZ}}{dX} H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast) + G_{XZ}(X) \\frac{dH_{YZ}}{dY^\\ast} \\frac{dY^\\ast}{dX} \\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the sign of each term in this expression for $X \\ge 0$:\n-   Parameters: $k_Z > 0$ and $\\gamma_Z > 0$, so their ratio $\\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z}$ is positive.\n-   Hill functions: The values of the Hill functions $G_{XZ}(X)$ and $H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast)$ are always non-negative for non-negative inputs. So, $G_{XZ}(X) \\ge 0$ and $H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast) \\ge 0$.\n-   Derivatives of Hill functions: Let $f(u) = \\frac{u^n}{K^n + u^n}$ be a generic Hill activation function with $n \\ge 1$, $K > 0$, and $u \\ge 0$. Its derivative is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{df}{du} = \\frac{n u^{n-1} (K^n + u^n) - u^n (n u^{n-1})}{(K^n + u^n)^2} = \\frac{n K^n u^{n-1}}{(K^n + u^n)^2}\n    $$\n    Since $n \\ge 1$, $K > 0$, and $u \\ge 0$, the derivative $\\frac{df}{du}$ is always non-negative ($\\ge 0$). Thus, all Hill activation functions are monotonically non-decreasing.\n-   Applying this to our functions:\n    -   $\\frac{dG_{XZ}}{dX} \\ge 0$\n    -   $\\frac{dH_{YZ}}{dY^\\ast} \\ge 0$\n-   Derivative of $Y^\\ast(X)$: The steady state $Y^\\ast$ is given by $Y^\\ast(X) = \\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y} F_{XY}(X)$. We differentiate it with respect to $X$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dY^\\ast}{dX} = \\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y} \\frac{dF_{XY}}{dX}\n    $$\n    Since $\\frac{k_Y}{\\gamma_Y} > 0$ and $F_{XY}(X)$ is a Hill activation function, its derivative $\\frac{dF_{XY}}{dX} \\ge 0$. Therefore, $\\frac{dY^\\ast}{dX} \\ge 0$.\n\nCombining these results, the expression for $\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX}$ consists of a sum of products of non-negative terms, all multiplied by a positive constant:\n$$\n\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX} = \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{k_Z}{\\gamma_Z}\\right)}_{>0} \\bigg[ \\underbrace{\\frac{dG_{XZ}}{dX}}_{\\ge 0} \\underbrace{H_{YZ}(Y^\\ast)}_{\\ge 0} + \\underbrace{G_{XZ}(X)}_{\\ge 0} \\underbrace{\\frac{dH_{YZ}}{dY^\\ast}}_{\\ge 0} \\underbrace{\\frac{dY^\\ast}{dX}}_{\\ge 0} \\bigg] \\ge 0\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX}$ is non-negative for all $X \\ge 0$.\n\n**Conclusion on Monotonicity:**\nSince $\\frac{dZ^\\ast}{dX} \\ge 0$ for all non-negative $X$, the steady-state concentration of the output protein, $Z^\\ast$, is a monotonically non-decreasing function of the input signal $X$. This behavior is a signature of coherent feed-forward loops where all regulatory interactions are activatory. The AND-gate logic, implemented by the multiplicative promoter function, does not introduce non-monotonicities; it simply requires both the direct pathway ($X \\to Z$) and the indirect pathway ($X \\to Y \\to Z$) to be sufficiently activated for a strong output response, but the overall input-output characteristic remains monotonic.",

We will first derive the expressions for $t_{\\text{on}}$ and $t_{\\text{off}}$ separately and then compute their ratio. The analysis relies on solving the given ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under the simplifying assumption that Hill functions behave as Heaviside step functions.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the turn-on time, $t_{\\text{on}}$ (Induction)\n\nFor the induction scenario, the input $u(t)$ switches from $0$ to $1$ at $t=0$. The initial conditions are $X(0)=0$ and $Y(0)=0$.\n\nThe dynamics of the transcription factor $X$ are governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\alpha_X - \\gamma_X X, \\quad X(0)=0\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE. The solution is:\n$$\nX(t) = \\frac{\\alpha_X}{\\gamma_X}(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma_X t)) = X_{\\infty}(1 - \\exp(-\\gamma_X t))\n$$\nwhere $X_{\\infty} = \\alpha_X/\\gamma_X$ is the steady-state concentration of $X$.\n\nThe dynamics of the intermediate factor $Y$ are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\alpha_Y H_X(X) - \\gamma_Y Y, \\quad Y(0)=0\n$$\nUsing the step-function approximation, $H_X(X) \\approx \\Theta(X - K_{XY})$, the production of $Y$ initiates only when the concentration of $X$ crosses the threshold $K_{XY}$.

            "problem": "Consider a transcriptional module in a gene circuit relevant to synthetic biology modeling where an input transcription factor $X$ regulates an output protein $Z$, and possibly also a repressor $Y$ that feeds forward to $Z$. The system can be implemented either as a single-input regulation or as an incoherent feed-forward loop (FFL) with OR gating. In the incoherent feed-forward loop, $X$ activates both $Z$ and $Y$, while $Y$ represses $Z$. The objective is to quantify the de-induction kinetics after a step-down of $X$ and to demonstrate conditions under which the incoherent FFL accelerates the de-induction compared to single-input regulation by deriving a shorter half-off time $t_{\\text{off}}$.\n\nUse the following modeling assumptions and fundamental base:\n\n- Transcriptional production is modeled by Hill-type regulation and linear degradation. Let $Z$ and $Y$ obey $$\\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha f(X,Y) - \\gamma Z,$$ where $\\alpha$ is a maximal synthesis rate and $\\gamma$ is the first-order degradation/dilution rate of $Z$.\n- For single-input regulation, define the promoter activity as $$f_{\\text{SI}}(X) = b + (1-b)\\frac{X^{p}}{K_{X}^{p} + X^{p}},$$ where $b \\in (0,0.5)$ is a basal activity fraction, $p \\geq 1$ is a Hill coefficient, and $K_{X}$ is a dissociation constant. The steady state at high input is $$Z_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma}.$$ After a step-down of $X$ from a high inducing level $X_{\\text{on}}$ to $0$ at time $t=0$, the production becomes $$\\alpha f_{\\text{SI}}(0) = \\alpha b.$$\n- For the incoherent feed-forward loop under OR gating, $X$ activates $Z$ directly and activates $Y$, while $Y$ represses $Z$. Define the OR-gated promoter activity as $$f_{\\text{OR}}(X,Y) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{X^{p}}{K_{X}^{p} + X^{p}}\\right)\\left(1 - q(Y)\\right),$$ where the derepression term $$q(Y) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{Y}{K_{Y}}\\right)^{n}}$$ is a decreasing Hill function describing the fraction of time the promoter is not bound by the repressor $Y$, $K_{Y}$ is the dissociation constant for repressor binding, and $n \\geq 2$ is a Hill coefficient for repression cooperativity. Assume $Y$ kinetics are $$\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{X^{m}}{K_{XY}^{m} + X^{m}} - \\gamma_{Y} Y,$$ so that after the step-down $X(t \\geq 0) = 0$, the repressor decays exponentially, $$Y(t) = Y_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma_{Y} t),$$ where $Y_{0}$ is the pre-step steady state at $X_{\\text{on}}$.\n- Before the step-down, with $X_{\\text{on}} \\gg K_{X}$, both single-input and feed-forward loop modules achieve the same $Z_{\\text{on}} = \\alpha/\\gamma$. At $t=0$, $X$ is set to $0$. For the FFL under OR gating with $X=0$, the direct activation branch is off, and the promoter activity reduces to $$f_{\\text{OR}}(0,Y(t)) = q(Y(t)).$$ Consequently, the $Z$ dynamics after the step-down in the FFL are $$\\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha q(Y(t)) - \\gamma Z.$$\n\nYou are given parameter ranges ensuring strong initial repression and slow repressor decay relative to $Z$: assume $$\\frac{Y_{0}}{K_{Y}} \\geq 10,\\quad n \\geq 2,\\quad \\gamma_{Y} \\leq \\frac{\\gamma}{5}.$$ Under these ranges, $q(Y(t))$ is initially very small and remains small over the time window in which $Z$ crosses half of its pre-step steady state.\n\nDefine the de-induction half-time $t_{\\text{off}}$ as the time at which $Z(t)$ first reaches $Z_{\\text{on}}/2$. Starting from the equations above and fundamental kinetic laws (Hill regulation for synthesis and linear first-order degradation), derive:\n\n1. An exact expression for $t_{\\text{off}}$ in the single-input case.\n2.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and comparison of the de-induction half-time, $t_{\\text{off}}$, for two transcriptional modules: a single-input (SI) regulation scheme and an incoherent feed-forward loop (FFL) with OR gating. The half-time $t_{\\text{off}}$ is defined as the time when the output protein concentration $Z(t)$ reaches half of its initial steady-state value, $Z_{\\text{on}}$, following a step-down of the input signal $X$ from a high level to zero at $t=0$. The initial condition for both systems is $Z(0) = Z_{\\text{on}} = \\alpha/\\gamma$.\n\n### 1. De-induction half-time for the Single-Input (SI) case ($t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}$)\n\nFor the single-input module, after the step-down of $X$ to $0$ at $t=0$, the production term becomes a constant basal rate. The dynamics of $Z$ are described by the linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha f_{\\text{SI}}(0) - \\gamma Z = \\alpha b - \\gamma Z $$\nThe initial condition is $Z(0) = \\alpha/\\gamma$. This is a first-order linear ODE with a constant source term. The new steady-state level is $Z_{ss} = \\alpha b / \\gamma$. The general solution is of the form $Z(t) = Z_{ss} + (Z(0) - Z_{ss})\\exp(-\\gamma t)$.\nSubstituting the specific values for our problem:\n$$ Z(t) = \\frac{\\alpha b}{\\gamma} + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} - \\frac{\\alpha b}{\\gamma}\\right)\\exp(-\\gamma t) $$\n$$ Z(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} \\left( b + (1-b)\\exp(-\\gamma t) \\right) $$\nTo find the half-off time, $t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}$, we set $Z(t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}) = Z_{\\text{on}}/2 = (\\alpha/\\gamma)/2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} \\left( b + (1-b)\\exp(-\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}) \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = b + (1-b)\\exp(-\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}) $$\nSolving for $t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - b = (1-b)\\exp(-\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}) $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - b}{1 - b} $$\nSince the problem states $b \\in (0, 0.5)$, the numerator $0.5 - b$ is positive, and the denominator $1 - b$ is also positive. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5 - b}{1 - b}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5 - b}{1 - b}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{0.5 - b}{1 - b}\\right)^{-1}\\right) $$\nThus, the exact expression for the half-off time in the single-input case is:\n$$ t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - b}{0.5 - b}\\right) $$\n\n### 2. Approximate de-induction half-time for the FFL case ($t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}}$)\n\nFor the incoherent FFL, after the step-down of $X$ to $0$, the dynamics of $Z$ are governed by:\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} = \\alpha f_{\\text{OR}}(0, Y(t)) - \\gamma Z = \\alpha q(Y(t)) - \\gamma Z $$\nwhere $q(Y(t)) = \\frac{1}{1 + (Y(t)/K_Y)^n}$ and $Y(t) = Y_0 \\exp(-\\gamma_Y t)$. The initial condition is $Z(0) = \\alpha/\\gamma$.\n\nWe are given parameter ranges that justify an approximation: strong initial repression ($\\frac{Y_0}{K_Y} \\geq 10$), high cooperativity ($n \\geq 2$), and slow repressor decay relative to $Z$ decay ($\\gamma_Y \\leq \\gamma/5$). These conditions imply that the production term $\\alpha q(Y(t))$ is very small throughout the de-induction period.\n\nLet's justify this approximation. The half-life of $Z$ without any production is $\\ln(2)/\\gamma$. The timescale for de-induction, $t_{\\text{off}}$, will be of this order. During this time, the repressor level $Y(t)$ evolves as $Y(t) = Y_0\\exp(-\\gamma_Y t)$. At $t \\approx \\ln(2)/\\gamma$, the exponent is $-\\gamma_Y t \\approx -\\gamma_Y \\ln(2)/\\gamma$. Given $\\gamma_Y \\leq \\gamma/5$, this exponent is at most $-\\ln(2)/5 \\approx -0.139$.\nTherefore, $Y(t)$ remains high: $Y(t) \\geq Y_0 \\exp(-0.139) \\approx 0.87 Y_0$.\nThe term $(Y(t)/K_Y)^n$ in the denominator of $q(Y(t))$ thus remains large:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y(t)}{K_Y}\\right)^n \\geq \\left(\\frac{0.87 Y_0}{K_Y}\\right)^n \\geq (0.87 \\times 10)^n = (8.7)^n $$\nWith $n \\geq 2$, this quantity is at least $(8.7)^2 \\approx 75.7$.\nThis means that $q(Y(t)) = \\frac{1}{1 + (Y(t)/K_Y)^n}$ is always very small in the time window of interest, $q(Y(t)) \\leq \\frac{1}{1 + 75.7} \\approx 0.013$.\n\nThe degradation term is $-\\gamma Z$. In the interval $t \\in [0, t_{\\text{off}}]$, $Z(t)$ ranges from $\\alpha/\\gamma$ to $\\alpha/(2\\gamma)$. The magnitude of the degradation rate, $\\gamma Z(t)$, is between $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha/2$. The production rate, $\\alpha q(Y(t))$, is at most $\\approx 0.013\\alpha$. Since $0.013\\alpha$ is negligible compared to a value of at least $0.5\\alpha$, we can approximate the production term as zero.\nThe ODE simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dZ}{dt} \\approx -\\gamma Z $$\nWith the initial condition $Z(0) = \\alpha/\\gamma$, the solution is:\n$$ Z(t) \\approx \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} \\exp(-\\gamma t) $$\nWe find the approximate half-off time, $t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}}$, by setting $Z(t) = Z_{\\text{on}}/2 = \\alpha/(2\\gamma)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\gamma} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma} \\exp(-\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\gamma t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}}) $$\n$$ t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}} \\approx \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\gamma} $$\nThis approximation corresponds to the case of pure degradation with no synthesis, which is justified by the strong and persistent repression by $Y$.\n\n### 3. Difference in half-times ($\\Delta t_{\\text{off}}$)\n\nWe now compute the difference $\\Delta t_{\\text{off}} = t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}} - t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}$.\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\gamma} - \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - b}{0.5 - b}\\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left[ \\ln(2) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - b}{0.5 - b}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{\\frac{1 - b}{0.5 - b}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2(0.5 - b)}{1 - b}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\text{off}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 2b}{1 - b}\\right) $$\nFinally, we determine the sign of $\\Delta t_{\\text{off}}$ for the given range $b \\in (0, 0.5)$.\nThe argument of the logarithm is $\\frac{1 - 2b}{1 - b}$.\nFor $b \\in (0, 0.5)$:\n- The denominator $1 - b$ is positive.\n- The numerator $1 - 2b$ is also positive, since $b < 0.5 \\implies 2b < 1 \\implies 1 - 2b > 0$.\nTo determine if the argument is greater or less than $1$, we compare the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ 1 - 2b \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad 1 - b $$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides:\n$$ -2b \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad -b $$\nSince $b > 0$, multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality, so $2b > b$. This means $-2b < -b$.\nTherefore, $1 - 2b < 1 - b$. Since $1-b > 0$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{1 - 2b}{1 - b} < 1 $$\nThe natural logarithm of a positive number less than $1$ is negative. Thus, $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 2b}{1 - b}\\right) < 0$.\nAs $\\gamma > 0$, it follows that $\\Delta t_{\\text{off}} < 0$. This demonstrates that the incoherent FFL architecture accelerates the de-induction ($t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{FFL, OR}} < t_{\\text{off}}^{\\text{SI}}$) compared to the single-input architecture with basal expression. The acceleration is a direct consequence of the FFL's ability to actively shut down protein synthesis, overcoming the performance lag caused by the leaky promoter term $\\alpha b$ in the SI case.",
