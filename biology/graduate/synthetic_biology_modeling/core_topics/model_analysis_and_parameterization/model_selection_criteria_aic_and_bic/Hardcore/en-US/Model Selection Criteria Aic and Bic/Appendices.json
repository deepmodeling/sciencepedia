The task involves a standard application of maximum likelihood estimation and model selection theory to a common problem in quantitative biology.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\nFirst, we derive the maximum likelihood estimate ($\\mathrm{MLE}$) for the parameter $\\lambda$ of a Poisson distribution. Let the observed mRNA counts be $y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\}$, where $n=12$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a single observation $y_i$ from a Poisson distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ P(Y=y_i | \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{y_i!} $$\nSince the observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the likelihood function $L(\\lambda | y)$ for the entire dataset is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ L(\\lambda | y) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(Y=y_i | \\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{y_i!} $$\nTo simplify the maximization, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\lambda | y) = \\ln(L(\\lambda | y))$:\n$$ \\ell(\\lambda | y) = \\ln \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{y_i!} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{y_i!} \\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\ell(\\lambda | y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i \\ln(\\lambda) - \\lambda - \\ln(y_i!)) = (\\ln \\lambda) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n\\lambda - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(y_i!) $$\nTo find the MLE $\\hat{\\lambda}$, we take the derivative of $\\ell(\\lambda | y)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ell}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( (\\ln \\lambda) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n\\lambda - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(y_i!) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n $$\nSetting the derivative to zero and solving for $\\lambda$ yields the MLE, $\\hat{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\hat{\\lambda}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n = 0 \\implies \\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i}{n} = \\bar{y} $$\nThe MLE for the Poisson rate parameter is the sample mean of the observations. For the given dataset $y = \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2\\}$, the sample size is $n=12$ and the sum of counts is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} y_i = 0 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 27 $$\nThus, the numerical value for the MLE is:\n$$ \\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{27}{12} = 2.25 $$\nNext, we calculate the maximized log-likelihood, $\\ell(\\hat{\\lambda})$, by substituting $\\hat{\\lambda}$ back into the log-likelihood function:\n$$ \\ell(\\hat{\\lambda}) = (\\ln \\hat{\\lambda}) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n\\hat{\\lambda} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(y_i!) $$\nSubstituting the numerical values $\\sum y_i = 27$, $n=12$, and $\\hat{\\lambda}=2.25$:\n$$ \\ell(\\hat{\\lambda}) = 27 \\ln(2.25) - (12)(2.25) - \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\ln(y_i!) = 27 \\ln(2.25) - 27 - \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\ln(y_i!) $$\nThe term $\\sum \\ln(y_i!)$ is calculated based on the data:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\ln(y_i!) = 2\\ln(0!) + 2\\ln(1!) + 3\\ln(2!) + 2\\ln(3!) + 2\\ln(4!) + 1\\ln(5!) $$\nSince $0! = 1$ and $1! = 1$, $\\ln(0!) = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\ln(y_i!) = 3\\ln(2) + 2\\ln(6) + 2\\ln(24) + \\ln(120) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\ln(y_i!) \\approx 3(0.693147) + 2(1.791759) + 2(3.178054) + 4.787492 \\approx 16.806581 $$\nNow, we compute $\\ell(\\hat{\\lambda})$:\n$$ \\ell(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\approx 27 \\ln(2.25) - 27 - 16.806581 \\approx 27(0.810930) - 27 - 16.806581 $$\n$$ \\ell(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\approx 21.895116 - 27 - 16.806581 = -21.911465 $$\nNow we turn to the model selection criteria. The Akaike Information Criterion ($\\mathrm{AIC}$) is defined from first principles as an estimator of the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the fitted model and the true underlying generative process. For a model with $k$ free parameters, its standard form is:\n$$ \\mathrm{AIC} = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\theta}$ represents the vector of MLE parameters.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and its small-sample corrected version (AICc).\n\n**1. Expressions for AIC and AICc**\n\nThe Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence provides a measure of information lost when a candidate model is used to approximate a true data-generating process. AIC is derived as an asymptotically unbiased estimator of twice the expected KL divergence. It is composed of two parts: a term for goodness of fit and a penalty term for model complexity.\n\nThe goodness of fit is measured by the maximized log-likelihood, $\\ln \\hat{L}$. A higher log-likelihood indicates a better fit. The term representing fit in AIC is $-2 \\ln \\hat{L}$.\n\nThe penalty for model complexity is related to the number of estimated parameters, $k$. Asymptotically, for a model with $k$ parameters, fitting the model to the data introduces a bias. The correction for this bias is $2k$.\n\nCombining these, the expression for AIC is:\n$$ \\mathrm{AIC} = -2\\ln \\hat{L} + 2k $$\n\nThe derivation of AIC relies on asymptotic theory, which assumes an infinite sample size ($n \\to \\infty$). When the sample size $n$ is not large relative to the number of parameters $k$, AIC can be a biased estimator and may favor overly complex models. The small-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) adjusts for this finite-sample bias by adding a second-order correction term. This correction term depends on $n$ and $k$.\n\nThe expression for AICc is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{AICc} = \\mathrm{AIC} + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} $$\nSubstituting the expression for AIC, we obtain the full expression for AICc in terms of the primary variables:\n$$ \\mathrm{AICc} = -2\\ln \\hat{L} + 2k + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} $$\nThis expression is valid provided $n - k - 1 > 0$, which ensures the denominator is positive and avoids division by zero or a negative number.\n\n**2. Evaluation for Given Parameters**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   Number of observations: $n = 40$\n-   Number of parameters: $k = 8$\n-   Maximized log-likelihood: $\\ln \\hat{L} = -120$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of AIC:\n$$ \\mathrm{AIC} = -2\\ln \\hat{L} + 2k = -2(-120) + 2(8) = 240 + 16 = 256 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the value of AICc. We first check the condition $n - k - 1 > 0$:\n$$ 40 - 8 - 1 = 31 > 0 $$\nThe condition holds. We can now compute the correction term:\n$$ \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} = \\frac{2(8)(8+1)}{40-8-1} = \\frac{16 \\times 9}{31} = \\frac{144}{31} $$\nNow, we calculate AICc:\n$$ \\mathrm{AICc} = \\mathrm{AIC} + \\frac{144}{31} = 256 + \\frac{144}{31} \\approx 256 + 4.645161... \\approx 260.645161... $$\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Difference**\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical difference $\\Delta = \\mathrm{AICc} - \\mathrm{AIC}$ and its interpretation.\n$$ \\Delta = \\mathrm{AICc} - \\mathrm{AIC} = \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} $$\nFor the given values, this difference is:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{144}{31} \\approx 4.645161... $$\n\nIn the context of synthetic biology modeling, this difference has a significant interpretation. The ratio of sample size to parameters is $n/k = 40/8 = 5$. This ratio is small, which is a common scenario in biological studies where data collection is resource-intensive, but the underlying systems are complex, necessitating models with a non-trivial number of parameters. A general rule of thumb suggests using AICc when $n/k < 40$. Since $5 < 40$, the use of AICc is strongly indicated.\n\nThe positive value of $\\Delta \\approx 4.645$ represents the additional penalty that AICc imposes on the model compared to AIC. This larger penalty for complexity serves to counteract the tendency of AIC to favor over-parameterized models when the sample size is small. In a practical model selection scenario, one compares several candidate models and selects the one with the lowest AIC or AICc value. A difference of $\\approx 4.6$ between the AIC and AICc values for a given model is substantial and could easily alter the ranking of competing models. For instance, a more complex model that appears slightly better than a simpler one based on AIC might be correctly identified as inferior by AICc, thus preventing overfitting and promoting the selection of a more parsimonious and likely more generalizable model. In essence, the AICc correction enforces a stricter penalty for each parameter, a crucial adjustment when experimental data are limited.\n\nThe final task is to report the numerical value of this difference, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{144}{31} \\approx 4.645161... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $4.645$.",
