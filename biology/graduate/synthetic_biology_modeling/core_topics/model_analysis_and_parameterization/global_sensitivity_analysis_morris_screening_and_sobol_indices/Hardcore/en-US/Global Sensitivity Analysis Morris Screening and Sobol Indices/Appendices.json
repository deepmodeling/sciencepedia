It is a standard problem in global sensitivity analysis based on well-defined mathematical principles. All necessary information is provided to compute a unique, meaningful solution. The constant $c_0$ does not affect variance-based sensitivity indices, as they are invariant to constant offsets in the model output.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first transforming the input variables to simplify the analysis, then performing the functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) decomposition of the given function, calculating the total variance and partial variances, and finally computing the Sobol indices from these variances.\n\nThe input variables $P$, $R$, and $I$ are independent and identically distributed according to $\\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$. Let us define a new set of centered and scaled variables:\n$$x_P = P - \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x_R = R - \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x_I = I - \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThese new variables $x_P$, $x_R$, and $x_I$ are independent and identically distributed as $\\mathrm{Uniform}(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. The expected value and variance of a generic variable $u \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$ are:\n$$E[u] = \\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} z \\, dz = \\left[ \\frac{z^2}{2} \\right]_{-1/2}^{1/2} = 0$$\n$$V(u) = E[u^2] - (E[u])^2 = \\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} z^2 \\, dz - 0^2 = \\left[ \\frac{z^3}{3} \\right]_{-1/2}^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12}$$\nThus, for our transformed variables, we have $E[x_P] = E[x_R] = E[x_I] = 0$ and $V(x_P) = V(x_R) = V(x_I) = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nThe function $f(P,R,I)$ can be rewritten in terms of these new variables:\n$$f(x_P, x_R, x_I) = c_0 + a_P x_P + a_R x_R + a_I x_I + b_{PR} x_P x_R + b_{PI} x_P x_I + b_{RI} x_R x_I$$\nThis form of the function is its own functional ANOVA decomposition.

In our case, the terms are:\n- Zeroth-order term: $f_0 = E[f] = E[c_0 + \\dots] = c_0$, since the expectation of all other terms is zero due to $E[x_i]=0$.\n- First-order terms: $f_P = a_P x_P$, $f_R = a_R x_R$, $f_I = a_I x_I$.\n- Second-order terms: $f_{PR} = b_{PR} x_P x_R$, $f_{PI} = b_{PI} x_P x_I$, $f_{RI} = b_{RI} x_R x_I$.\n- The problem states there is no three-way interaction, so $f_{PRI} = 0$.\n\nThe orthogonality of these terms (e.g., $E[f_i f_j] = 0$ for $i \\neq j$) is guaranteed because the input variables are independent and the terms are constructed from products of variables with zero mean. Due to this orthogonality, the total variance of the function, $D = V(f)$, is the sum of the variances of the individual ANOVA terms (partial variances). The constant term $c_0$ has zero variance.\n$$D = V(f_P) + V(f_R) + V(f_I) + V(f_{PR}) + V(f_{PI}) + V(f_{RI})$$\nLet us calculate these partial variances, denoted $V_u$.\nFor the first-order terms:\n$V_P = V(a_P x_P) = a_P^2 V(x_P) = a_P^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)$.\n$V_R = V(a_R x_R) = a_R^2 V(x_R) = a_R^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)$.\n$V_I = V(a_I x_I) = a_I^2 V(x_I) = a_I^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)$.\n\nFor the second-order terms, variance is $V(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2$. Since $E[f_{ij}]=0$:\n$V_{PR} = V(b_{PR} x_P x_R) = E[(b_{PR} x_P x_R)^2] = b_{PR}^2 E[x_P^2]E[x_R^2] = b_{PR}^2 V(x_P) V(x_R) = b_{PR}^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b_{PR}^2}{144}$.\nSimilarly:\n$V_{PI} = \\frac{b_{PI}^2}{144}$, and $V_{RI} = \\frac{b_{RI}^2}{144}$.\n\nSubstituting the given coefficient values: $a_P=2$, $a_R=1$, $a_I=3$, $b_{PR}=3$, $b_{PI}=2$, $b_{RI}=1$:\n$V_P = \\frac{2^2}{12} = \\frac{4}{12}$\n$V_R = \\frac{1^2}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n$V_I = \\frac{3^2}{12} = \\frac{9}{12}$\n$V_{PR} = \\frac{3^2}{144} = \\frac{9}{144}$\n$V_{PI} = \\frac{2^2}{144} = \\frac{4}{144}$\n$V_{RI} = \\frac{1^2}{144} = \\frac{1}{144}$\n\nThe total variance $D$ is:\n$$D = \\left(\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{9}{12}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{9}{144} + \\frac{4}{144} + \\frac{1}{144}\\right) = \\frac{14}{12} + \\frac{14}{144} = \\frac{14 \\times 12}{144} + \\frac{14}{144} = \\frac{168 + 14}{144} = \\frac{182}{144} = \\frac{91}{72}$$\n\nThe Sobol indices are defined as the ratio of the partial variances to the total variance.\nFirst-order indices, $S_i = V_i / D$:\n$S_P = \\frac{V_P}{D} = \\frac{4/12}{91/72} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{72}{91} = \\frac{24}{91}$\n$S_R = \\frac{V_R}{D} = \\frac{1/12}{91/72} = \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot \\frac{72}{91} = \\frac{6}{91}$\n$S_I = \\frac{V_I}{D} = \\frac{9/12}{91/72} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{72}{91} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 18}{91} = \\frac{54}{91}$\n\nSecond-order indices, $S_{ij} = V_{ij} / D$:\n$S_{PR} = \\frac{V_{PR}}{D} = \\frac{9/144}{91/72} = \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{72}{91} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 91} = \\frac{9}{182}$\n$S_{PI} = \\frac{V_{PI}}{D} = \\frac{4/144}{91/72} = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot \\frac{72}{91} = \\frac{2}{91} = \\frac{4}{182}$\n$S_{RI} = \\frac{V_{RI}}{D} = \\frac{1/144}{91/72} = \\frac{1}{144} \\cdot \\frac{72}{91} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 91} = \\frac{1}{182}$\n\nThe total-order index $S_{T_i}$ for an input $X_i$ is the sum of all sensitivity indices involving $X_i$.\n$S_{T_P} = S_P + S_{PR} + S_{PI} = \\frac{24}{91} + \\frac{9}{182} + \\frac{4}{182} = \\frac{48}{182} + \\frac{9}{182} + \\frac{4}{182} = \\frac{61}{182}$\n$S_{T_R} = S_R + S_{PR} + S_{RI} = \\frac{6}{91} + \\frac{9}{182} + \\frac{1}{182} = \\frac{12}{182} + \\frac{9}{182} + \\frac{1}{182} = \\frac{22}{182} = \\frac{11}{91}$\n$S_{T_I} = S_I + S_{PI} + S_{RI} = \\frac{54}{91} + \\frac{4}{182} + \\frac{1}{182} = \\frac{108}{182} + \\frac{4}{182} + \\frac{1}{182} = \\frac{113}{182}$\n\nThe nine requested indices are:\n$S_P = \\frac{24}{91}$, $S_R = \\frac{6}{91}$, $S_I = \\frac{54}{91}$\n$S_{PR} = \\frac{9}{182}$, $S_{PI} = \\frac{4}{182}$, $S_{RI} = \\frac{1}{182}$\n$S_{T_P} = \\frac{61}{182}$, $S_{T_R} = \\frac{11}{91}$, $S_{T_I} = \\frac{113}{182}$\nThese values will be placed in a row matrix as the final answer.",

The Morris screening method is a standard, widely used technique in GSA. The definitions of the elementary effect, $\\mu_i$, $\\mu_i^*$, and $\\sigma_i$ are correct and standard in the literature on the Morris method.

It presents a specific, well-documented result from a Morris analysis ($\\mu_i \\approx 0$, large $\\mu_i^*$) and asks for its interpretation and implications. This scenario has a clear and standard explanation in the GSA literature.\n3.  **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It uses standard mathematical definitions and avoids subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **No other flaws detected**: The problem is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable. It describes a classic case study in the interpretation of Morris screening results.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe Morris method is a global sensitivity analysis technique used for screening, which aims to distinguish influential input factors from non-influential ones in a computationally efficient manner. It relies on the computation of elementary effects, $d_i(\\mathbf{x})$, which are finite-difference approximations of the partial derivative of the output function $f$ with respect to an input factor $x_i$ at various points $\\mathbf{x}$ in the input space.\n\nThe key statistics derived from the distribution of elementary effects for each factor $x_i$ are:\n1.  **The mean, $\\mu_i = \\mathbb{E}[d_i(\\mathbf{x})]$**: This measures the average overall effect of $x_i$ on the output. If a factor has a predominantly positive (or negative) effect across the input space (i.e., the function is largely monotonic with respect to $x_i$), then $\\mu_i$ will have a large magnitude.\n2.  **The mean of absolute values, $\\mu_i^* = \\mathbb{E}[|d_i(\\mathbf{x})|]$**: This measures the average magnitude of the effect, regardless of its direction. A large $\\mu_i^*$ indicates that $x_i$ is an influential factor, as it causes significant changes in the output, on average.\n3.  **The standard deviation, $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{\\mathbb{V}[d_i(\\mathbf{x})]}$**: This measures the spread or variability of the elementary effects. A large $\\sigma_i$ indicates that the effect of $x_i$ is not constant; it changes depending on the location $\\mathbf{x}$ in the input space. This variability can arise from two sources: (a) non-linear dependence of the output on $x_i$, or (b) interactions between $x_i$ and other factors $x_j$ (where $j \\neq i$).\n\nThe problem presents a specific scenario where, for a factor $x_i$, the empirical results show $\\mu_i \\approx 0$ while $\\mu_i^*$ is large. Let us analyze this.\n\n-   A large $\\mu_i^*$ signifies that the factor $x_i$ has a substantial impact on the output $y$. The magnitude of the change in $y$ caused by a change in $x_i$ is, on average, large. This immediately implies that factor $x_i$ is important and should not be screened out.\n\n-   A value of $\\mu_i \\approx 0$ indicates that the average of the elementary effects is close to zero. Given that the individual effects are large in magnitude (as per large $\\mu_i^*$), the only way their average can be near zero is if there is a cancellation between large positive effects and large negative effects. This means that for some points $\\mathbf{x}$ in the input space, increasing $x_i$ increases $y$ (i.e., $d_i(\\mathbf{x}) > 0$), while for other points, increasing $x_i$ decreases $y$ (i.e., $d_i(\\mathbf{x}) < 0$).\n\nThis pattern of positive and negative effects is a classic sign of either:\n-   **Non-monotonicity**: The function $f$ is not monotonic with respect to $x_i$. For example, an optimal value might exist, where the response first increases and then decreases as $x_i$ increases. This is plausible for an inducer involved in both activation and repression.\n-   **Strong interactions**: The sign of the effect of $x_i$ depends on the values of other factors $x_j$. For instance, $x_i$ might be an activator when $x_j$ is low, but an inhibitor when $x_j$ is high.\n\nA non-negligible $\\sigma_i$ is consistent with and reinforces this conclusion. The variance is defined as $\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathbb{V}[d_i(\\mathbf{x})] = \\mathbb{E}[d_i(\\mathbf{x})^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[d_i(\\mathbf{x})])^2 = \\mathbb{E}[d_i^2] - \\mu_i^2$. Since $\\mu_i \\approx 0$, we have $\\sigma_i^2 \\approx \\mathbb{E}[d_i^2]$. By Jensen's inequality, for any non-negative random variable $|Z|$, $\\mathbb{E}[Z^2] \\ge (\\mathbb{E}[Z])^2$. Applying this to $|d_i|$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[d_i^2] = \\mathbb{E}[|d_i|^2] \\ge (\\mathbb{E}[|d_i|])^2 = (\\mu_i^*)^2$. Thus, a large $\\mu_i^*$ implies a large lower bound on $\\sigma_i^2$, explaining why $\\sigma_i$ is also non-negligible or large. A large $\\sigma_i$ is the primary indicator of non-linearity and/or interactions in the Morris method.\n\nThe implication for analysis is that $x_i$ is an influential factor whose effect is complex. It should be retained for more detailed, quantitative analysis. Variance-based methods, such as calculating Sobol' indices, are the appropriate next step. The total-effect Sobol' index, $S_{T_i}$, is particularly relevant as it quantifies the total contribution of $x_i$ to the output variance, including its first-order effect and all its interactions.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The pattern $\\mu_i \\approx 0$ with large $\\mu_i^*$ indicates that $f$ is monotone in $x_i$, so the elementary effects have a consistent sign and small magnitude; thus $x_i$ is unimportant and can be dropped from further analysis.**\n-   This statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. If $f$ were monotone in $x_i$, the elementary effects $d_i(\\mathbf{x})$ would have a consistent sign (all positive or all negative). In this case, $\\mu_i^* = \\mathbb{E}[|d_i(\\mathbf{x})|] \\approx |\\mathbb{E}[d_i(\\mathbf{x})]| = |\\mu_i|$, which contradicts the given condition that $\\mu_i \\approx 0$ while $\\mu_i^*$ is large. A large $\\mu_i^*$ indicates the effects have large, not small, magnitude on average. A factor with a large $\\mu_i^*$ is by definition influential, not unimportant.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The pattern is consistent with nonmonotonic dependence of $f$ on $x_i$ and/or strong interactions, producing positive and negative elementary effects that cancel in $\\mu_i$ while $\\mu_i^*$ remains large; $x_i$ should be retained for further analysis, for example by estimating variance-based total-effect Sobol indices $S_{T_i}$.**\n-   This statement accurately describes the situation. The cancellation of positive and negative elementary effects explains why $\\mu_i \\approx 0$ despite large individual effect magnitudes (leading to large $\\mu_i^*$). This pattern is the hallmark of non-monotonicity and/or interactions. The conclusion that $x_i$ is an important factor to be retained is correct. Suggesting the estimation of total-effect Sobol' indices $S_{T_i}$ is the standard and appropriate next step for quantitatively assessing such a complex factor.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The discrepancy between $\\mu_i$ and $\\mu_i^*$ arises only from numerical noise; with more trajectories, both statistics must converge to the same nonzero value for influential factors.**\n-   This is incorrect. The problem explicitly assumes noise-free evaluations and sufficient sampling, so the result is a feature of the function $f$, not a numerical artifact. Furthermore, $\\mu_i = \\mathbb{E}[d_i]$ and $\\mu_i^* = \\mathbb{E}[|d_i|]$ are fundamentally different statistics. They are equal only if the random variable $d_i$ is always non-negative or always non-positive. For a factor with non-monotonic/interactive effects, they will converge to different values, specifically with $\\mu_i$ potentially being zero and $\\mu_i^*$ being large and non-zero.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $\\mu_i \\approx 0$ and $\\mu_i^*$ is large, then all second-order effects involving $x_i$ are necessarily zero, so there is no evidence of interactions with other factors.**\n-   This statement is the opposite of the correct interpretation. As discussed, a large discrepancy between $\\mu_i$ and $\\mu_i^*$ (often accompanied by a large $\\sigma_i$) is strong evidence *for* the presence of interactions or non-linear effects. It in no way implies that second-order effects (interactions) are zero.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. A large $\\mu_i^*$ with small $\\mu_i$ can coincide with a large $\\sigma_i$, signaling either pronounced nonlinearity or interactions across the input domain. For screening, $x_i$ should not be discarded; instead, one may use second-order Morris designs or compute $S_{T_i}$ to quantify the total contribution including interactions.**\n-   This statement is also correct and provides a more complete picture. It correctly links the given pattern to a large $\\sigma_i$, which is mathematically sound ($\\sigma_i^2 \\approx \\mathbb{E}[d_i^2] \\ge (\\mu_i^*)^2$ when $\\mu_i \\approx 0$). It correctly interprets a large $\\sigma_i$ as a signal of nonlinearity or interactions. It correctly concludes that the factor should not be discarded. The suggested follow-up actions, using second-order Morris designs (which are designed to better estimate interaction effects) or computing $S_{T_i}$, are both advanced and appropriate strategies for dealing with such a factor.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.",

Morris screening is a common technique for factor screening (identifying influential parameters), and Sobol' indices estimated via Saltelli sampling represent a gold standard for variance-based global sensitivity analysis. The use of a two-stage approach to manage the computational burden for a model with a moderate number of parameters ($k=25$) is a realistic and sound scientific strategy. The specified numerical values for $k$, $r$, $N$, and $p$ are plausible within this context.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and methodological specifications to calculate a unique numerical answer. The objective is clearly defined.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, missing data, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the expected relative reduction in computational cost, denoted by $R$, for a two-stage sensitivity analysis workflow compared to a full Sobol' analysis on all parameters. The cost is defined as the number of model evaluations.\n\nThe relative cost reduction $R$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nR = \\frac{C_{\\text{full}} - C_{\\text{workflow}}}{C_{\\text{full}}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{\\text{workflow}}}{C_{\\text{full}}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{full}}$ is the cost of the full Sobol' analysis on all $k$ parameters, and $C_{\\text{workflow}}$ is the expected total cost of the two-stage workflow.\n\nWe must first determine the cost of each component.\n\n**1. Cost of the Full Sobol' Analysis ($C_{\\text{full}}$)**\nThe estimation of both first-order and total-order Sobol' indices for a model with $d$ parameters using Saltelli's sampling method requires the evaluation of the model for a base sample matrix $A$ (size $N \\times d$), a second independent sample matrix $B$ (size $N \\times d$), and $d$ additional matrices where the $i$-th column is taken from $B$ and all other columns are taken from $A$. This results in a total of $N + N + d \\times N = N(d+2)$ model evaluations.\nFor the full analysis, the number of parameters is $d=k$. Therefore, the cost is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{full}} = N(k+2)\n$$\n\n**2. Expected Cost of the Two-Stage Workflow ($C_{\\text{workflow}}$)**\nThe total cost of the workflow is the sum of the cost of the Morris screening stage and the expected cost of the subsequent Sobol' analysis on the reduced set of parameters.\n$$\nC_{\\text{workflow}} = C_{\\text{Morris}} + \\text{E}[C_{\\text{Sobol', reduced}}]\n$$\n\n**2.1. Cost of OAT Morris Screening ($C_{\\text{Morris}}$)**\nThe One-at-a-Time (OAT) Morris screening method involves generating $r$ random trajectories in the parameter space. Each trajectory consists of a starting point and $k$ subsequent points, each generated by perturbing one of the $k$ parameters. Thus, each trajectory requires $(k+1)$ model evaluations. For $r$ trajectories, the total cost is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{Morris}} = r(k+1)\n$$\n\n**2.2. Expected Cost of the Reduced Sobol' Analysis ($\\text{E}[C_{\\text{Sobol', reduced}}]$)**\nAfter screening, a reduced number of parameters, let's call it $k'$, will be retained for the more expensive Sobol' analysis. The problem states that the expected fraction of retained parameters is $p$. Thus, the expected number of retained parameters is:\n$$\n\\text{E}[k'] = kp\n$$\nThe cost of the Sobol' analysis on these $k'$ parameters is $N(k'+2)$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected cost is:\n$$\n\\text{E}[C_{\\text{Sobol', reduced}}] = \\text{E}[N(k'+2)] = N(\\text{E}[k'] + 2) = N(kp+2)\n$$\n\n**2.3. Total Workflow Cost**\nCombining the costs from both stages, the total expected cost of the workflow is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{workflow}} = C_{\\text{Morris}} + \\text{E}[C_{\\text{Sobol', reduced}}] = r(k+1) + N(kp+2)\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Relative Cost Reduction ($R$)**\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $C_{\\text{full}}$ and $C_{\\text{workflow}}$ into the formula for $R$:\n$$\nR = 1 - \\frac{r(k+1) + N(kp+2)}{N(k+2)}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $k = 25$\n-   $r = 20$\n-   $N = 4000$\n-   $p = 0.2$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerical values for the costs.\nThe cost of the full Sobol' analysis is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{full}} = 4000 \\times (25+2) = 4000 \\times 27 = 108000\n$$\nThe expected number of retained parameters is:\n$$\n\\text{E}[k'] = 25 \\times 0.2 = 5\n$$\nThe cost of the Morris screening stage is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{Morris}} = 20 \\times (25+1) = 20 \\times 26 = 520\n$$\nThe expected cost of the reduced Sobol' analysis is:\n$$\n\\text{E}[C_{\\text{Sobol', reduced}}] = 4000 \\times (5+2) = 4000 \\times 7 = 28000\n$$\nThe total expected cost of the two-stage workflow is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{workflow}} = 520 + 28000 = 28520\n$$\nFinally, we compute the relative reduction $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{108000 - 28520}{108000} = \\frac{79480}{108000}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 0.7359259...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 0.7359\n$$",
