This exercise  challenges you to derive the fundamental noise metrics for the canonical bursty gene expression model, starting from the first principles of stochastic processes. By mastering this derivation, you will uncover how transcriptional bursting directly contributes to the total variance, establishing the theoretical foundation for interpreting the Fano factor and coefficient of variation in experimental data.",

            "problem": "Consider a synthetic gene expression module in which protein molecules are produced in instantaneous bursts and degrade individually. Bursts arrive as a homogeneous Poisson process of rate $k$, and each burst adds a random number of molecules $B$ to the copy number. The burst size $B$ is independent and identically distributed across bursts and follows a geometric distribution with mean $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(B)=b(1+b)$. Each molecule degrades independently at rate $\\gamma$ according to first-order kinetics. Let $X(t)$ denote the protein copy number at time $t$, and assume the system is in statistical steady state with mean $\\mu=\\mathbb{E}[X]$. Starting from the definitions of the infinitesimal generator for a continuous-time Markov jump process and the law of mass action for first-order degradation, derive the steady-state second moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^{2}]$ of the copy number. Then, using the definitions of the Fano factor $F=\\mathrm{Var}(X)/\\mathbb{E}[X]$ and the coefficient of variation squared (CV) defined as $\\mathrm{CV}^{2}=\\mathrm{Var}(X)/(\\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}$, compute $F$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^{2}$ in terms of $b$ and $\\mu$, eliminating $k$ and $\\gamma$ from your final expressions. Express your final answer as a single analytical expression. No rounding is required, and units are not needed because the quantities are dimensionless ratios.",
            "solution": "The user wants me to solve a problem in the field of synthetic biology modeling, specifically related to stochastic gene expression.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.  **Validate the problem statement.**\n    *   Extract all the given information.\n    *   Check for scientific soundness, consistency, completeness, and objectivity.\n\n2.  **If the problem is valid, proceed with the solution.**\n    *   The core of the problem is to derive the steady-state second moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$ for a bursty gene expression model.\n    *   The model has two processes:\n        *   Production: Bursts arrive via a Poisson process with rate $k$. Each burst adds $B$ molecules, where $B$ is a random variable.\n        *   Degradation: Each molecule degrades with rate $\\gamma$.\n    *   The problem specifies that $B$ follows a geometric distribution with $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(B)=b(1+b)$. This is a standard result for a geometric distribution starting from 1 (i.e., $P(B=j) = (1-p)^{j-1}p$ for $j=1, 2, ...$ where the mean is $1/p$). The given mean is $b$, so $p=1/b$. The variance is $(1-p)/p^2 = (1-1/b)/(1/b)^2 = (b(b-1)/b) / (1/b^2) = b^2(b-1)$. This does not match $b(1+b)$. Let's check the other geometric distribution, starting from 0 (i.e., $P(B=j) = (1-p)^j p$ for $j=0, 1, ...$). The mean is $(1-p)/p$. The variance is $(1-p)/p^2$. Let the mean be $b = (1-p)/p$. Then the variance is $b/p = b(1+b)$. This matches! So the burst size distribution is $P(B=j) = (1-p)^j p$ for $j=0, 1, 2, ...$ with mean $b=(1-p)/p$. It's important to note this, but the problem gives the moments directly, which is what I need. So I don't need to explicitly use the distribution form, just its moments. The problem statement gives $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(B)=b(1+b)$. This is consistent with a specific type of geometric distribution. I will proceed using these moments.\n\n    *   The problem asks to start from the infinitesimal generator for a continuous-time Markov jump process. Let $X(t)$ be the number of protein molecules at time $t$. The state space is $\\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$.\n    *   The transition rates are:\n        *   Production: From state $n$ to state $n+j$, the rate is $k \\times P(B=j)$. This is a jump of size $j$.\n        *   Degradation: From state $n$ to state $n-1$, the rate is $\\gamma n$. This is a jump of size $-1$.\n\n    *   The Master Equation governs the time evolution of the probability distribution $P(n, t) = P(X(t)=n)$.\n        $$ \\frac{d P(n, t)}{dt} = \\text{flux in} - \\text{flux out} $$\n        $$ \\frac{d P(n, t)}{dt} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} k P(B=j) P(n-j, t) - k P(n, t) + \\gamma(n+1) P(n+1, t) - \\gamma n P(n, t) $$\n        This looks complicated.\n\n    *   A more direct approach is to use the moment dynamics. The problem hints at using the infinitesimal generator. The rate of change of the expectation of any function $f(X(t))$ is given by:\n        $$ \\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[f(X)]}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{A}f(X)] $$\n        where $\\mathcal{A}$ is the infinitesimal generator.\n        For a jump process with jumps of size $j$ occurring at rate $W(x \\to x+j)$, the generator acts on a function $f(x)$ as:\n        $$ \\mathcal{A}f(x) = \\sum_j W(x \\to x+j) [f(x+j) - f(x)] $$\n        In our case, we have two types of jumps:\n        1.  Production: $x \\to x+B$, rate $k$. The jump size $B$ is a random variable.\n        2.  Degradation: $x \\to x-1$, rate $\\gamma x$.\n\n        So the generator is:\n        $$ \\mathcal{A}f(x) = k \\mathbb{E}_B[f(x+B) - f(x)] + \\gamma x [f(x-1) - f(x)] $$\n        The expectation is over the burst size distribution.\n\n    *   **Derive the equation for the first moment $\\mathbb{E}[X]$:**\n        Let $f(x) = x$.\n        $$ \\mathcal{A} (x) = k \\mathbb{E}_B[(x+B) - x] + \\gamma x [(x-1) - x] $$\n        $$ \\mathcal{A} (x) = k \\mathbb{E}_B[B] - \\gamma x $$\n        $$ \\mathcal{A} (x) = k b - \\gamma x $$\n        The time evolution of the mean $\\mu(t) = \\mathbb{E}[X(t)]$ is:\n        $$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{A}(X)] = \\mathbb{E}[kb - \\gamma X] = kb - \\gamma \\mathbb{E}[X] = kb - \\gamma \\mu $$\n        At steady state, $\\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = 0$.\n        So, $kb - \\gamma \\mu = 0$.\n        $$ \\mu = \\frac{kb}{\\gamma} $$\n        This confirms the standard result and provides a relationship between the parameters. The problem states that the steady-state mean is $\\mu$.\n\n    *   **Derive the equation for the second moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$:**\n        Let $f(x) = x^2$.\n        $$ \\mathcal{A} (x^2) = k \\mathbb{E}_B[(x+B)^2 - x^2] + \\gamma x [(x-1)^2 - x^2] $$\n        Let's expand the terms:\n        *   Production term: $k \\mathbb{E}_B[x^2 + 2xB + B^2 - x^2] = k \\mathbb{E}_B[2xB + B^2] = k (2x \\mathbb{E}_B[B] + \\mathbb{E}_B[B^2]) = k(2xb + \\mathbb{E}[B^2])$\n        *   Degradation term: $\\gamma x [x^2 - 2x + 1 - x^2] = \\gamma x [-2x + 1] = -2\\gamma x^2 + \\gamma x$\n\n        So, the generator action is:\n        $$ \\mathcal{A} (x^2) = k(2xb + \\mathbb{E}[B^2]) - 2\\gamma x^2 + \\gamma x $$\n        The time evolution of the second moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^2(t)]$ is:\n        $$ \\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{A}(X^2)] = \\mathbb{E}[k(2Xb + \\mathbb{E}[B^2]) - 2\\gamma X^2 + \\gamma X] $$\n        $$ \\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = 2kb\\mathbb{E}[X] + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2] - 2\\gamma\\mathbb{E}[X^2] + \\gamma\\mathbb{E}[X] $$\n        At steady state, $\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = 0$. Let $\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X]$ and $M_2 = \\mathbb{E}[X^2]$.\n        $$ 0 = 2kb\\mu + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2] - 2\\gamma M_2 + \\gamma \\mu $$\n        Now, solve for $M_2$:\n        $$ 2\\gamma M_2 = 2kb\\mu + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2] + \\gamma \\mu $$\n        $$ M_2 = \\frac{2kb\\mu + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2] + \\gamma \\mu}{2\\gamma} $$\n        $$ M_2 = \\frac{kb}{\\gamma}\\mu + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}\\mathbb{E}[B^2] + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu $$\n        We know that $\\mu = \\frac{kb}{\\gamma}$. Substitute this in:\n        $$ M_2 = \\mu^2 + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}\\mathbb{E}[B^2] + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu $$\n        The problem gives the moments of the burst size $B$: $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(B) = b(1+b)$.\n        We need $\\mathbb{E}[B^2]$. We know $\\mathrm{Var}(B) = \\mathbb{E}[B^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[B])^2$.\n        So, $\\mathbb{E}[B^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(B) + (\\mathbb{E}[B])^2 = b(1+b) + b^2 = b + b^2 + b^2 = b + 2b^2$.\n        Now substitute this into the expression for $M_2$:\n        $$ M_2 = \\mu^2 + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}(b + 2b^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu $$\n        The problem asks for the final answer in terms of $b$ and $\\mu$, eliminating $k$ and $\\gamma$.\n        We have $\\mu = kb/\\gamma$, which implies $k/\\gamma = \\mu/b$.\n        Substitute this:\n        $$ M_2 = \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mu}{b}(b + 2b^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu $$\n        $$ M_2 = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2b}(b) + \\frac{\\mu}{2b}(2b^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu $$\n        $$ M_2 = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\mu b + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu $$\n        $$ M_2 = \\mu^2 + \\mu + \\mu b = \\mu^2 + \\mu(1+b) $$\n        So, the steady-state second moment is $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\mu^2 + \\mu(1+b)$.\n        Let's double-check the derivation.\n        $\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = 2kb\\mathbb{E}[X] + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2] - 2\\gamma\\mathbb{E}[X^2] + \\gamma\\mathbb{E}[X]$\n        At steady state: $2\\gamma \\mathbb{E}[X^2] = (2kb+\\gamma)\\mathbb{E}[X] + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2]$\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\frac{2kb+\\gamma}{2\\gamma}\\mu + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}\\mathbb{E}[B^2]$\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = (\\frac{kb}{\\gamma} + \\frac{1}{2})\\mu + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}(b+2b^2)$\n        Since $\\mu = kb/\\gamma$:\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = (\\mu + \\frac{1}{2})\\mu + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}(b+2b^2)$\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\mu}{b}(b+2b^2)$\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\mu b$\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\mu^2 + \\mu + \\mu b = \\mu^2 + \\mu(1+b)$.\n        This looks correct.\n\n    *   **Now compute the variance $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$:**\n        $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 = M_2 - \\mu^2$\n        $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = (\\mu^2 + \\mu(1+b)) - \\mu^2 = \\mu(1+b)$\n\n    *   **Compute the Fano factor $F$:**\n        $F = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\mathbb{E}[X]} = \\frac{\\mu(1+b)}{\\mu} = 1+b$\n\n    *   **Compute the coefficient of variation squared $\\mathrm{CV}^2$:**\n        $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{(\\mathbb{E}[X])^2} = \\frac{\\mu(1+b)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{1+b}{\\mu}$\n\n    *   Final check. The problem asks for the computation of $F$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$.\n        The final answer should be a single analytical expression. This is slightly ambiguous. Does it want one expression for F and one for CV^2, or a single combined expression? \"Express your final answer as a single analytical expression.\" usually means one thing. Let me re-read. \"compute $F$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^{2}$... Express your final answer as a single analytical expression\". This could be a malformed question, but the `pmatrix` rule from the instructions gives a hint: \"Write multiple answers as a row matrix using the LaTeX pmatrix environment.\" This is the most likely intended format. So the final answer should be a pmatrix containing the expressions for $F$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2$.\n\n    *   So the final answers are $F = 1+b$ and $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{1+b}{\\mu}$.\n\n    *   Let's check these results against known literature. This is the standard \"bursty\" gene expression model. The variance is often written in terms of Fano factor. $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mu F = \\mu(1+b)$. This is a very well-known result in systems biology. The noise, measured by $\\mathrm{CV}^2$, is decomposed into two terms:\n        $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{\\mu(1+b)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} + \\frac{b}{\\mu}$.\n        The first term $1/\\mu$ is the 'Poisson' term, representing noise from random arrival and degradation of single molecules (if $b=1$, bursts are of size 1, this doesn't fully reduce to the simple birth-death process, because the variance of burst size is not zero).\n        Let's consider the simple birth-death process (non-bursty). Production rate is $k_{tx}$, degradation rate is $\\gamma$.\n        Mean is $\\mu = k_{tx}/\\gamma$. Variance is also $\\mu$. Fano factor is 1. $\\mathrm{CV}^2=1/\\mu$.\n        In our bursty model, the total rate of molecule production is $k \\times \\mathbb{E}[B] = kb$. This is equivalent to $k_{tx}$ in the simple model.\n        So $\\mu = kb/\\gamma$.\n        The variance is $\\sigma^2 = \\mu \\left(1 + \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(B) - \\mathbb{E}[B]}{\\mathbb{E}[B]}\\right)$ - No, this is not the right formula.\n        Let's use the standard formula for variance from Shahrezaei and Swain (2008), which is one of the foundational papers.\n        $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\langle n \\rangle} + \\frac{\\langle b(b-1) \\rangle}{ \\langle b \\rangle \\langle n \\rangle}$.\n        Here, $n$ is protein number, $b$ is burst size. $\\langle n \\rangle = \\mu$. $\\langle b \\rangle = b$.\n        $\\langle b(b-1) \\rangle = \\langle b^2 - b \\rangle = \\mathbb{E}[B^2] - \\mathbb{E}[B]$.\n        We found $\\mathbb{E}[B^2] = b+2b^2$ and $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$.\n        So $\\mathbb{E}[B^2] - \\mathbb{E}[B] = (b+2b^2) - b = 2b^2$.\n        So, $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu} + \\frac{2b^2}{b \\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} + \\frac{2b}{\\mu} = \\frac{1+2b}{\\mu}$.\n        This is yet another different result. What is going on?\n\n        Let me check the Shahrezaei  Swain paper's definition of the geometric distribution for burst size.\n        They use $P(b) = p(1-p)^{b-1}$ for $b=1, 2, ...$\n        For this distribution, $\\mathbb{E}[B] = 1/p$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(B) = (1-p)/p^2$.\n        Let $\\langle b \\rangle = b_{ss}$. Then $p=1/b_{ss}$.\n        $\\mathrm{Var}(B) = (1-1/b_{ss}) / (1/b_{ss}^2) = \\frac{b_{ss}-1}{b_{ss}} b_{ss}^2 = b_{ss}(b_{ss}-1)$.\n        The problem states $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(B)=b(1+b)$. This corresponds to a different distribution. As noted before, it's a geometric distribution starting from $j=0$.\n        $P(B=j) = p(1-p)^j$ for $j=0, 1, ...$.\n        Mean is $\\langle B \\rangle = (1-p)/p$. Variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(B) = (1-p)/p^2$.\n        Let mean be $b = (1-p)/p$. Then $Variance = b/p = b(1+b)$. This is the one used in the problem.\n        So this is a geometric distribution of *failures* before the first success.\n        \n        So the formula from Shahrezaei  Swain was derived for a different burst size distribution. I must rely on my own derivation from first principles.\n\n        Let's re-re-check the derivation. I am getting nervous now.\n        $\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = 2kb \\mu + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2] - 2\\gamma \\mathbb{E}[X^2] + \\gamma \\mu$\n        At steady state: $2\\gamma \\mathbb{E}[X^2] = (2kb+\\gamma)\\mu + k\\mathbb{E}[B^2]$. All seems solid.\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\frac{2kb+\\gamma}{2\\gamma}\\mu + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}\\mathbb{E}[B^2] = (\\frac{kb}{\\gamma}+\\frac{1}{2})\\mu + \\frac{k}{2\\gamma}\\mathbb{E}[B^2]$. OK.\n        $\\mu = kb/\\gamma \\implies k/\\gamma = \\mu/b$. OK.\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = (\\mu+\\frac{1}{2})\\mu + \\frac{\\mu}{2b}\\mathbb{E}[B^2] = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\frac{\\mu}{2b}\\mathbb{E}[B^2]$. OK.\n        $\\mathbb{E}[B^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(B)+(\\mathbb{E}[B])^2 = b(1+b)+b^2 = b+2b^2$. OK.\n        $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\frac{\\mu}{2b}(b+2b^2) = \\mu^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\mu b = \\mu^2+\\mu+\\mu b$. OK.\n        $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[X^2]-\\mu^2 = \\mu(1+b)$. OK.\n        $F = \\mathrm{Var}(X)/\\mu = 1+b$. OK.\n        $\\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(X)/\\mu^2 = (1+b)/\\mu$. OK.\n\n        The derivation seems robust. The discrepancy with published formulas is likely due to different assumptions about the burst size distribution, which is a key detail. The problem statement is very specific: \"burst size B is ... distributed ... with mean $\\mathbb{E}[B]=b$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(B)=b(1+b)$\". My derivation uses these moments directly, without assuming any specific distribution beyond that. So my result should be correct *for the premises given in the problem*.\n\n        Another way to check is to use a probability generating function (PGF) approach.\n        Let $G(z,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^n P(n,t)$ be the PGF of the protein number distribution.\n        The master equation is:\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial P(n, t)}{\\partial t} = k \\sum_{j=0}^{n} P(B=j) P(n-j, t) - k P(n, t) + \\gamma(n+1) P(n+1, t) - \\gamma n P(n, t) $$\n        (Assuming burst of size 0 is possible, consistent with the geometric distribution starting from 0).\n        Multiply by $z^n$ and sum over $n$:\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial t} = k \\sum_n z^n \\sum_j P(B=j) P(n-j, t) - k \\sum_n z^n P(n, t) + \\gamma \\sum_n z^n (n+1) P(n+1, t) - \\gamma \\sum_n z^n n P(n, t) $$\n        Let's analyze the terms.\n        1. Production term: $\\sum_n z^n \\sum_j P(B=j) P(n-j, t)$. This is a convolution. Let $G_B(z) = \\sum_j P(B=j) z^j$ be the PGF for the burst size. Then this term is $k G_B(z) G(z,t)$.\n        2. First degradation term: $\\gamma \\sum_n z^n (n+1) P(n+1, t)$. Let $m=n+1$. $\\gamma \\sum_m z^{m-1} m P(m,t) = \\gamma \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}$.\n        3. Second degradation term: $-\\gamma \\sum_n z^n n P(n,t) = -\\gamma z \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z}$.\n        So the full equation is:\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial t} = k G_B(z) G(z,t) - k G(z,t) + \\gamma \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z} - \\gamma z \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z} $$\n        $$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial t} = k(G_B(z) - 1)G(z,t) + \\gamma(1-z)\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z} $$\n        At steady state, $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n        $$ \\gamma(z-1)\\frac{dG}{dz} = k(G_B(z) - 1)G(z) $$\n        This is a first-order linear ODE for $G(z)$.\n        $\\frac{dG}{G} = \\frac{k}{\\gamma} \\frac{G_B(z) - 1}{z-1} dz$.\n        $G(z) = \\exp \\left( \\frac{k}{\\gamma} \\int_1^z \\frac{G_B(u)-1}{u-1} du \\right)$.

            "problem": "In a canonical bursty gene expression model at steady state, molecules are produced in random bursts driven by promoter activity and are removed by first-order degradation. In a common abstraction used in synthetic biology modeling, bursts arrive according to a Poisson process, the burst size per arrival is geometrically distributed with mean burst size $b$, and removal is memoryless with rate proportional to the molecule count. Under these assumptions, single-cell counts across an isogenic population are often consistent with a Negative Binomial (NB) distribution. Two standard noise metrics are the Fano factor $F$, defined by $F = \\mathrm{Var}(X)/\\mathbb{E}[X]$, and the coefficient of variation (CV), defined by $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}/\\mathbb{E}[X]$, where $X$ is the random count at steady state.

            "solution": "The problem requires two steps: first, to derive an expression for the mean burst size $b$ in terms of the Fano factor $F$ and the mean molecule count $\\mu$ for a canonical bursty gene expression model; second, to use this expression and a given dataset to compute a numerical estimate for $b$.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Expression for Mean Burst Size $b$\n\nThe problem specifies a canonical bursty gene expression model where molecules are produced in bursts and degraded via a first-order process. It is stated that the steady-state molecule count, let's call it the random variable $X$, follows a Negative Binomial (NB) distribution.\n\nThe Negative Binomial distribution can be parameterized in several ways. A common parameterization for this physical context uses a dispersion parameter $r > 0$ and a probability $p \\in (0,1)$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\binom{k+r-1}{k} p^{r} (1-p)^{k} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} $$\nThe mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ of a random variable $X$ following this distribution are:\n$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{r(1-p)}{p} $$\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2} $$\n\nThe problem defines the Fano factor, $F$, as the ratio of the variance to the mean:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\\mathbb{E}[X]} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the mean and variance of the NB distribution, we get:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}}{\\frac{r(1-p)}{p}} = \\frac{1}{p} $$\n\nThese statistical parameters, $r$ and $p$, can be directly related to the physical parameters of the gene expression model. In the canonical bursty model:\n1.  Bursts of molecules arrive as a Poisson process. Let the rate of burst arrivals be $k_{burst}$.\n2.  The number of molecules produced per burst is a random variable. The problem states it follows a geometric distribution with a mean burst size of $b$.\n3.  Molecules are degraded at a rate $\\gamma$ per molecule.\n\nFor this model, the parameters $r$ and $p$ of the resulting stationary NB distribution for the molecule count $X$ are given by:\n$$ r = \\frac{k_{burst}}{\\gamma} $$\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{1+b} \\quad (\\text{which corresponds to a mean burst size of } b) $$\nLet's confirm the mean burst size. A common form for a geometric distribution over $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$ is $P(S=k) = (1-q)q^k$, which has mean $q/(1-q)$. If we set $b=q/(1-q)$ and $p=1-q$, then $q=1-p$, so $b=(1-p)/p$. This gives $p=1/(1+b)$, consistent with our choice.\n\nNow, we can express the Fano factor $F$ in terms of the mean burst size $b$:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{p} = 1+b $$\nThis is a cornerstone result in the analysis of noise in gene expression. It states that the Fano factor of the molecule count distribution is greater than one (super-Poissonian) by an amount equal to the mean burst size.\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for $b$ in terms of $F$ and $\\mu$. We can solve the derived relationship for $b$:\n$$ b = F-1 $$\nThis expression gives the mean burst size $b$ as a function of the Fano factor $F$. Notably, $b$ does not explicitly depend on the mean molecule count $\\mu$. The mean $\\mu$ is determined by both the burst size and burst frequency ($\\mu = k_{burst} b / \\gamma = r b$), but the Fano factor reflects the burst size alone. Thus, the derived expression fully satisfies the prompt.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Estimation of Mean Burst Size $b$\n\nWe are asked to construct a method-of-moments estimator for $b$ using the provided data. The estimation procedure is:\n1.  Calculate empirical estimates for the mean ($\\bar{x}$) and variance ($v$) from the data.\n2.  Use these to calculate an empirical Fano factor, $\\hat{F} = v / \\bar{x}$.\n3.  Substitute $\\hat{F}$ into our derived expression to find the estimate $\\hat{b}$.\n\nThe given single-cell count data are: $\\{3, 5, 12, 14, 7, 20, 9, 11, 16, 8\\}$.\nThe sample size is $n=10$.\n\nFirst, we compute the empirical mean, $\\bar{x}$:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{1}{10}(3 + 5 + 12 + 14 + 7 + 20 + 9 + 11 + 16 + 8) $$\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{105}{10} = 10.5 $$\n\nNext, we compute the empirical variance, $v$, using the specified formula for the population central moment:\n$$ v = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(x_i - \\bar{x}\\right)^{2} $$\nThe sum of squared deviations is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left(x_i - 10.5\\right)^{2} = (3-10.5)^2 + (5-10.5)^2 + (12-10.5)^2 + (14-10.5)^2 + (7-10.5)^2 + (20-10.5)^2 + (9-10.5)^2 + (11-10.5)^2 + (16-10.5)^2 + (8-10.5)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum\\left(x_i - 10.5\\right)^{2} = (-7.5)^2 + (-5.5)^2 + (1.5)^2 + (3.5)^2 + (-3.5)^2 + (9.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (5.5)^2 + (-2.5)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum\\left(x_i - 10.5\\right)^{2} = 56.25 + 30.25 + 2.25 + 12.25 + 12.25 + 90.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 30.25 + 6.25 = 242.5 $$\nNow we compute $v$:\n$$ v = \\frac{242.5}{10} = 24.25 $$\n\nNext, we compute the empirical Fano factor, $\\hat{F}$:\n$$ \\hat{F} = \\frac{v}{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{24.25}{10.5} = \\frac{97}{42} \\approx 2.3095238... $$\n\nFinally, we compute the method-of-moments estimator for the mean burst size, $\\hat{b}$, using our derived formula $\\hat{b} = \\hat{F}-1$:\n$$ \\hat{b} = \\frac{97}{42} - 1 = \\frac{97 - 42}{42} = \\frac{55}{42} $$\n$$ \\hat{b} \\approx 1.3095238... $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final numerical value rounded to four significant figures.\n$1.30952... \\to 1.310$.\n\nThe estimated mean burst size is $1.310$.",

In contrast, the Fano factor $\\mathrm{FF}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(X)/\\mathbb{E}[X]$ scales linearly with $c$, since $\\mathrm{FF}(Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y)/\\mathbb{E}[Y] = c \\, \\mathrm{FF}(X)$, and therefore is not invariant to gain differences; this highlights why $\\mathrm{CV}$ is preferable for cross-instrument normalization under multiplicative effects.",
