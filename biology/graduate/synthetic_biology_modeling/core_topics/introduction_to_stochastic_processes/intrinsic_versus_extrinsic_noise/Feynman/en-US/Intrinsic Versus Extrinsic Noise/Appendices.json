            "problem": "A synthetic gene encoding a fluorescent protein is carried on a multicopy plasmid in an isogenic bacterial population. Let the plasmid copy number per cell be a random variable $N$ that varies across the population due to cell-to-cell differences in plasmid replication control and cell cycle state. Conditional on a fixed $N$, protein molecules are produced with a zero-order synthesis rate proportional to $N$ and are removed by first-order dilution due to cell growth. Specifically, the conditional protein birth rate is $k_{p} N$ (molecules per unit time), and the protein removal rate is $\\gamma P$ (per unit time), where $P$ is the protein copy number in a single cell.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The system is at steady state.\n- The plasmid copy number $N$ is constant over the timescale of protein turnover within a single cell, so that conditioning on $N$ is meaningful for the protein dynamics.\n- The plasmid copy number $N$ across the population has mean $\\mathbb{E}[N]=10$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(N)=5$.\n- The synthesis and dilution parameters are $k_{p}=0.025\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ per plasmid copy and $\\gamma=0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from first principles grounded in the chemical master equation for a linear birth–death process and basic identities from probability theory, derive an expression for the total protein variance across the population in terms of $k_{p}$, $\\gamma$, $\\mathbb{E}[N]$, and $\\mathrm{Var}(N)$ by separating contributions that arise from stochastic protein birth–death when $N$ is fixed (intrinsic noise) and contributions that arise from variability in $N$ across cells (extrinsic noise). Then, using your derived expression, compute the fraction of the total steady-state protein variance that is attributable to the extrinsic noise due solely to plasmid copy number variability. Express your final answer as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the total protein variance and the subsequent calculation of the fraction of this variance attributable to extrinsic noise from plasmid copy number variability. The solution will proceed by first modeling the protein dynamics as a conditional stochastic process, then using the Law of Total Variance to partition the noise, and finally substituting the given numerical values.\n\n**Step 1: Modeling Protein Dynamics and Conditional Distribution**\n\nThe dynamics of the protein copy number, $P$, within a single cell are described as a linear birth–death process. Crucially, the birth rate is conditional on the plasmid copy number, $N$, in that cell.\nThe protein birth rate is given as $\\lambda = k_p N$.\nThe protein removal rate for a cell with $P$ proteins is $\\mu_P = \\gamma P$, which corresponds to a first-order rate constant of $\\gamma$ per protein molecule.\n\nFor a fixed plasmid copy number $N$, this system is a classic linear birth–death process with a constant birth rate and a linearly increasing death rate. The steady-state solution to the chemical master equation for this process is a Poisson distribution. The parameter of this Poisson distribution, which is its mean, is the ratio of the birth rate to the first-order death rate constant.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability distribution of the protein number $P$ given the plasmid number $N$ is:\n$$ P | N \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}\\left(\\frac{k_p N}{\\gamma}\\right) $$\nA fundamental property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean. Thus, the conditional mean and conditional variance of $P$ given $N$ are:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[P|N] = \\frac{k_p N}{\\gamma} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(P|N) = \\frac{k_p N}{\\gamma} $$\n\n**Step 2: Partitioning Variance using the Law of Total Variance**\n\nThe total variance of the protein copy number, $\\mathrm{Var}(P)$, across the entire isogenic population must account for the variability in the plasmid copy number $N$ from cell to cell. The Law of Total Variance (also known as Eve's Law) provides a formal decomposition of the total variance into components related to conditional variance and the variance of conditional means. The law states:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(P) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(P|N)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[P|N]) $$\n\nThis decomposition has a direct physical interpretation in the context of gene expression noise:\n- The term $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(P|N)]$ is the *intrinsic noise*. It represents the stochasticity inherent in the birth and death of protein molecules, averaged over the population of cells with different plasmid numbers. Even if $N$ were identical in every cell, this term would be non-zero due to the probabilistic nature of chemical reactions.\n- The term $\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[P|N])$ is the *extrinsic noise*. It represents the variability in protein number that arises because the mean protein level, $\\mathbb{E}[P|N]$, is itself a function of the fluctuating quantity $N$. This term quantifies how variability in an upstream factor ($N$) propagates to the downstream variable ($P$).\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Total Variance Expression**\n\nWe can now derive the expression for each noise component using the conditional moments from Step 1 and the properties of expectation and variance.\n\nThe intrinsic noise component is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{int}}(P) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(P|N)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{k_p N}{\\gamma}\\right] $$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, we can pull the constants out:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{int}}(P) = \\frac{k_p}{\\gamma} \\mathbb{E}[N] $$\n\nThe extrinsic noise component is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{ext}}(P) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[P|N]) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{k_p N}{\\gamma}\\right) $$\nUsing the variance property $\\mathrm{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$, where $a$ is a constant, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{ext}}(P) = \\left(\\frac{k_p}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(N) $$\n\nThe total protein variance across the population is the sum of these two components:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(P)_{\\text{total}} = \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{int}}(P) + \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{ext}}(P) = \\frac{k_p}{\\gamma} \\mathbb{E}[N] + \\left(\\frac{k_p}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(N) $$\nThis is the required expression for the total protein variance in terms of the given parameters and moments of $N$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Extrinsic Noise Fraction**\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the total variance that is attributable to extrinsic noise due to plasmid copy number variability. This fraction is the ratio of the extrinsic variance to the total variance:\n$$ \\text{Fraction}_{\\text{extrinsic}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{ext}}(P)}{\\mathrm{Var}(P)_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_p}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(N)}{\\frac{k_p}{\\gamma} \\mathbb{E}[N] + \\left(\\frac{k_p}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(N)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n- Mean plasmid copy number: $\\mathbb{E}[N] = 10$\n- Variance of plasmid copy number: $\\mathrm{Var}(N) = 5$\n- Protein synthesis rate constant per plasmid: $k_p = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n- Protein dilution rate constant: $\\gamma = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we compute the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{k_p}{\\gamma} = \\frac{0.025\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{0.05\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}} = 0.5 $$\nThis unitless ratio represents the average number of proteins produced per plasmid lifetime.\n\nNow, we substitute this value and the moments of $N$ into the fraction expression:\n$$ \\text{Fraction}_{\\text{extrinsic}} = \\frac{(0.5)^2 \\times 5}{0.5 \\times 10 + (0.5)^2 \\times 5} $$\n$$ \\text{Fraction}_{\\text{extrinsic}} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 5}{5 + 0.25 \\times 5} $$\n$$ \\text{Fraction}_{\\text{extrinsic}} = \\frac{1.25}{5 + 1.25} $$\n$$ \\text{Fraction}_{\\text{extrinsic}} = \\frac{1.25}{6.25} $$\n\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\text{Fraction}_{\\text{extrinsic}} = \\frac{125}{625} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ 0.2 \\rightarrow 0.2000 $$\nTherefore, $20\\%$ of the total protein variance is attributable to the extrinsic noise caused by cell-to-cell variations in the plasmid copy number.",

Baseline condition: degradation rate $\\gamma$, mean $\\mu_1 = 50$, and noise $\\mathrm{CV}_1^2 = 0.0500$.\n2.  Perturbed condition: degradation rate $2\\gamma$, mean $\\mu_2 = 25$, and noise $\\mathrm{CV}_2^2 = 0.0700$.\n\nThe model predicts that $\\mu_2 = k_0/(2\\gamma) = (1/2)(k_0/\\gamma) = \\mu_1/2$. The data is consistent with this prediction, as $25 = 50/2$. The extrinsic factor distribution, and thus $\\sigma_E^2$, is unchanged by the perturbation.\n\nWe can set up a system of two equations using our derived formula:\nFor the baseline condition:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_1^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\sigma_E^2 \\implies 0.0500 = \\frac{1}{50} + \\sigma_E^2 $$\nFor the perturbed condition:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_2^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + \\sigma_E^2 \\implies 0.0700 = \\frac{1}{25} + \\sigma_E^2 $$\nWe can solve for $\\sigma_E^2$ using either equation. Using the first equation:\n$$ \\sigma_E^2 = 0.0500 - \\frac{1}{50} = 0.0500 - 0.0200 = 0.0300 $$\nUsing the second equation as a check:\n$$ \\sigma_E^2 = 0.0700 - \\frac{1}{25} = 0.0700 - 0.0400 = 0.0300 $$\nBoth equations yield the identical result, confirming the consistency of the model with the provided data.\n\nThe numeric value of $\\sigma_E^2$ is $0.03$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $0.03$ with four significant figures, we write it as $0.03000$.",
