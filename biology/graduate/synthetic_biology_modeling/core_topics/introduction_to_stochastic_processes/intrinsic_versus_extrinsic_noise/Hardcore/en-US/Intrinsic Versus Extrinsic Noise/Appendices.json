            "problem": "Consider a well-mixed, isothermal volume $V$ with a bimolecular reaction $A + B \\to C$ and mass-action kinetics with rate constant $k$. Let the system be modeled as a continuous-time Markov jump process for the copy-number vector $\\mathbf{X}(t) = \\big(A(t), B(t), C(t)\\big)$ with the Chemical Master Equation (CME). The propensity of the reaction is $a\\big(\\mathbf{X}(t)\\big) = \\dfrac{k}{V}\\,A(t)\\,B(t)$. The terms intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise are used as follows: intrinsic noise refers to randomness arising from the stochastic timing of reaction events inside the modeled reaction network with fixed parameters and volume; extrinsic noise refers to randomness in the dynamics of the modeled species induced by variability of parameters or inputs driven by processes outside the modeled network. From the perspective of $A$, one may choose different modeling boundaries and coarse-grainings that change how the fluctuations of $B$ are represented.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly classify whether fluctuations in $B$ constitute intrinsic or extrinsic noise from the perspective of $A$, and under what modeling assumptions this classification is consistent? Select all that apply.\n\nA. If the modeled system is closed and includes $A$, $B$, and $C$ as state variables with fixed $k$ and $V$, then all fluctuations, including those in $B$, are intrinsic at the network level. From the perspective of $A$, the effect of $B$ on the hazard $a(\\mathbf{X})$ is an internal coupling; calling $B$’s variability extrinsic would be inconsistent with the CME under this system boundary.\n\nB. If one coarse-grains to an $A$-only description by treating $B(t)$ as an externally supplied stochastic input with a law independent of $A$ and with no feedback from $A$ to $B$, then from $A$’s perspective fluctuations in $B$ are extrinsic. This classification is consistent provided that, conditional on a realized path of $B(t)$, $A(t)$ is a time-inhomogeneous Markov jump process with propensity $a(t) = \\dfrac{k}{V}\\,A(t)\\,B(t)$ and the randomness driving $B$ is exogenous to the internal reaction noise of $A$.\n\nC. Even when the full network $\\big(A,B,C\\big)$ is modeled as a closed CME with fixed $k$ and $V$, a strong separation of timescales that makes $B$ fast automatically renders $B$’s fluctuations extrinsic to $A$, because fast variables are, by definition, environmental. Therefore, calling $B$ extrinsic is consistent without further assumptions.\n\nD. If $B$ is maintained by a chemostat that fixes its mean but allows stochastic inflow and outflow independent of $A$, and the chemostat is not included explicitly in the model for $A$, then the observed fluctuations in $B$ are extrinsic from $A$’s perspective. This classification is consistent if the chemostat dynamics are unaffected by $A$ so that $B$ acts as a one-way, exogenous driver.\n\nE. The label extrinsic for $B$’s fluctuations is appropriate if and only if the mean copy number of $B$ is large, since large-number fluctuations dominate $A$’s dynamics; therefore, the magnitude of $B$ alone determines extrinsic versus intrinsic, independent of modeling boundary or feedback.",
            "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific and logical consistency.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens\n- System: A well-mixed, isothermal volume $V$.\n- Reaction: A single bimolecular reaction, $A + B \\to C$.\n- Kinetics: Mass-action kinetics with rate constant $k$.\n- Model framework: Continuous-time Markov jump process.\n- State vector: $\\mathbf{X}(t) = \\big(A(t), B(t), C(t)\\big)$, where $A(t)$, $B(t)$, and $C(t)$ are copy numbers.\n- Governing equation: Chemical Master Equation (CME).\n- Propensity function: $a\\big(\\mathbf{X}(t)\\big) = \\dfrac{k}{V}\\,A(t)\\,B(t)$.\n- Definition of Intrinsic Noise: \"randomness arising from the stochastic timing of reaction events inside the modeled reaction network with fixed parameters and volume\".\n- Definition of Extrinsic Noise: \"randomness in the dynamics of the modeled species induced by variability of parameters or inputs driven by processes outside the modeled network\".\n- Objective: To determine which statements correctly classify fluctuations in the species $B$ as intrinsic or extrinsic from the perspective of species $A$ under various modeling assumptions.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-defined within the standard theoretical framework of stochastic chemical kinetics. The definitions provided for intrinsic and extrinsic noise are the conventional ones used in the field of systems biology, notably articulated by Paulsson, and Elowitz et al. The core of the problem is to test the understanding of a fundamental concept: that the classification of noise as 'intrinsic' or 'extrinsic' is not an absolute property of a species' fluctuations but is instead contingent upon the choice of the system boundary in the mathematical model. The problem presents several distinct and non-contradictory modeling scenarios to explore this concept. The language is precise and objective. There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no missing information for the conceptual analysis, and the problem is not ill-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a rigorous conceptual question suitable for analysis. I will now proceed with the solution by evaluating each statement.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the definition of the \"system\". Noise is intrinsic if its source is part of the stochastic dynamics *within* the defined system boundary. Noise is extrinsic if its source is *outside* this boundary, manifesting as fluctuations in the system's parameters or as a stochastic input driving the system.\n\nEvaluation of Option A:\nThe statement posits a system where the state is the complete vector $\\mathbf{X}(t) = \\big(A(t), B(t), C(t)\\big)$, with fixed parameters $k$ and $V$. In this model, the entire network is the system. The reaction $A + B \\to C$ describes an internal coupling between state variables $A(t)$ and $B(t)$. The fluctuations in the copy number of $B(t)$ arise from the same source as the fluctuations in $A(t)$: the random timing of reaction events as described by the CME for this network. According to the provided definition, this is the very essence of intrinsic noise. To label the effect of $B(t)$ on $A(t)$ as 'extrinsic' in this context would be a contradiction, as $B(t)$ is explicitly an internal component of the modeled system, not an external influence. The statement correctly identifies this consistency requirement.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option B:\nThis option describes a change in the system boundary through model reduction, or 'coarse-graining'. The new, reduced \"system\" consists only of the species $A$. The species $B$ is no longer a dynamic state variable *of this system* but is instead treated as an externally specified stochastic process, $B(t)$. The crucial conditions are that the law governing $B(t)$ is independent of $A(t)$ (no feedback from $A$ to $B$) and its randomness is \"exogenous\". In this modeling framework, the dynamics of $A(t)$ are governed by a time-inhomogeneous propensity $a(t) = \\dfrac{k}{V}\\,A(t)\\,B(t)$, where the time dependence is driven by the external process $B(t)$. The fluctuations in $B(t)$ are, by this construction, a source of randomness from outside the modeled system ($A$ alone) and thus perfectly fit the definition of extrinsic noise.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option C:\nThis statement claims that a strong separation of timescales, where $B$ is a \"fast\" variable relative to $A$, is sufficient on its own to render $B$'s fluctuations extrinsic. This is incorrect. Timescale separation is a physical condition that can *justify* a model approximation, such as the coarse-graining described in option B. However, within the original, full model of the $(A, B, C)$ network, $B$ remains an internal variable. Its fluctuations are and remain part of the intrinsic noise of the full system, regardless of its timescale. The act of reclassifying the noise requires the explicit act of model reduction, which redefines the system boundary. The statement \"fast variables are, by definition, environmental\" is a misleading oversimplification. A fast variable is not extrinsic by definition; it is a candidate for elimination from the model, and *if* it is eliminated and treated as a source of noise, *then* that noise is extrinsic to the new, reduced model. The statement improperly equates the physical justification for a model with the model itself.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nEvaluation of Option D:\nThis statement provides a concrete physical scenario. The system of interest is the dynamics of $A$. The species $B$ is supplied and removed by a chemostat, the dynamics of which are not explicitly included in the model for $A$. The chemostat itself introduces stochasticity into the copy number of $B$ (e.g., stochastic arrival of molecules in the inflow). This chemostat is an external apparatus. The statement specifies that the chemostat's dynamics are independent of $A$. This means $B(t)$ acts as a one-way driver on $A(t)$. From the perspective of the subsystem containing only $A$, the fluctuating concentration of $B$ is an input driven by an external process. This is precisely the situation described abstractly in option B and is a textbook example of extrinsic noise.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option E:\nThis statement asserts that the classification of noise depends \"if and only if\" on the mean copy number of $B$ being large. This is fundamentally wrong. The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic noise is a question of the *origin* of the randomness relative to the chosen model boundary, not the *magnitude* of a state variable or its fluctuations. Whether the mean of $B$ is large or small has no bearing on whether its fluctuations originate from inside or outside the defined system. A large population of an internal species still contributes to intrinsic noise. A small population of an external driver contributes to extrinsic noise. The magnitude of the species may affect the quantitative impact of the noise (e.g., large numbers often lead to smaller relative fluctuations), but it does not alter its fundamental classification.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in stochastic biophysics. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Conditional Distribution and Moments**\n\nWe begin with the Chemical Master Equation (CME) for a single reporter species $X$ (subscripts are omitted for clarity, as the reporters are identical and conditionally independent) with molecule count $n$. Conditional on the extrinsic factor $Z$, the production (birth) rate is $\\lambda = kZ$ and the degradation (death) rate for $n$ molecules is $\\mu_n = \\delta n$. The CME for the probability $P(n, t)$ of having $n$ molecules at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = \\lambda P(n-1,t) + \\delta(n+1)P(n+1,t) - (\\lambda + \\delta n)P(n,t)\n$$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dP(n)}{dt} = 0$. This implies a detailed balance condition for the net flux between adjacent states, leading to the recurrence relation:\n$$\n\\lambda P(n-1) = \\delta n P(n)\n$$\nThis relation can be solved by iteration:\n$$\nP(n) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta n} P(n-1) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta n} \\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta (n-1)} P(n-2) = \\dots = \\frac{1}{n!} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta}\\right)^n P(0)\n$$\nThe term $P(0)$ is found by the normalization condition $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(n) = 1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta}\\right)^n P(0) = P(0) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda/\\delta)^n}{n!} = P(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\delta}\\right) = 1\n$$\nThus, $P(0) = \\exp(-\\lambda/\\delta)$. Substituting this back gives the steady-state distribution:\n$$\nP(n) = \\frac{(\\lambda/\\delta)^n e^{-\\lambda/\\delta}}{n!}\n$$\nThis is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution. Re-introducing the explicit dependence on $Z$ and the reporter index $i$, the conditional distribution of $X_i$ given $Z$ is a Poisson distribution with parameter $kZ/\\delta$.\n$$\nP(X_i = x \\mid Z=z) = \\frac{(kz/\\delta)^x \\exp(-kz/\\delta)}{x!}\n$$\nFor a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\alpha$, both the mean and the variance are equal to $\\alpha$. Therefore, the first two conditional moments are:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{i}\\,|\\,Z] = \\frac{kZ}{\\delta}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X_{i}\\,|\\,Z] = \\frac{kZ}{\\delta}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Defining Intrinsic and Extrinsic Noise**\n\nThe total variance of $X_{i}$ can be decomposed using the law of total variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_i | Z)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_i | Z])\n$$\nThe first term, $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_i | Z)]$, is the expectation of the conditional variance. It represents the noise arising from the stochastic birth-death process for a fixed extrinsic state $Z$, averaged over all possible states $Z$. This is defined as the *intrinsic* contribution to the total variance.\n\nThe second term, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_i | Z])$, is the variance of the conditional expectation. It represents the noise arising from cell-to-cell fluctuations in the extrinsic factor $Z$. This is defined as the *extrinsic* contribution to the total variance.\n\nThe problem requires relating these definitions to the dual-reporter observables.\nConsider the covariance between $X_1$ and $X_2$. By the law of total covariance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2 | Z)] + \\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z], \\mathbb{E}[X_2 | Z])\n$$\nSince $X_1$ and $X_2$ are conditionally independent given $Z$, $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2 | Z) = 0$. As they are identical reporters, $\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z] = \\mathbb{E}[X_2 | Z]$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z], \\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z]) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z])\n$$\nThis shows that the covariance between the two reporters isolates the extrinsic component of variance.\n\nNow, consider the variance of the difference $D = X_1 - X_2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_1 - X_2) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(X_2) - 2\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2)\n$$\nSince the reporters are identically distributed, $\\mathrm{Var}(X_1) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_2)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D) = 2\\mathrm{Var}(X_1) - 2\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{Var}(X_1) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_1 | Z)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z])$ and $\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z])$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(D) = 2(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_1 | Z)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z])) - 2\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 | Z]) = 2\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_1 | Z)]\n$$\nThis shows that half the variance of the difference between the reporters isolates the intrinsic component of variance.\n\nThe noise contributions to the coefficient of variation squared are defined by normalizing the variance components by the squared mean expression level, $\\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2$.\nThe intrinsic noise contribution is:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{int}} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_i|Z)]}{\\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Var}(X_1-X_2)}{\\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2}\n$$\nThe extrinsic noise contribution is:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_i|Z])}{\\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2)}{\\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2}\n$$\nNote that since the reporters are identical, $\\mathbb{E}[X_1] = \\mathbb{E}[X_2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_i]$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Ratio R**\n\nThe ratio $R$ of extrinsic to intrinsic noise contributions is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{int}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_i|Z]) / \\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2}{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_i|Z)] / \\mathbb{E}[X_i]^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_i|Z])}{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_i|Z)]}\n$$\nWe use the results from Part 1 to evaluate the numerator and denominator.\nDenominator:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(X_i|Z)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{kZ}{\\delta}\\right] = \\frac{k}{\\delta}\\mathbb{E}[Z]\n$$\nNumerator:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X_i|Z]) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{kZ}{\\delta}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{k}{\\delta}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(Z)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(k/\\delta)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(Z)}{(k/\\delta) \\mathbb{E}[Z]} = \\frac{k}{\\delta} \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(Z)}{\\mathbb{E}[Z]}\n$$\nWe are given that $\\ln Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m, s^2)$, which means $Z$ follows a log-normal distribution.

The conditional mean and variance of $X$ are equal and given by:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X|E] = \\operatorname{Var}(X|E) = \\frac{k(E)}{\\gamma} = \\frac{k_0 E}{\\gamma} $$\nThis stochasticity, present even for a fixed $E$, is known as intrinsic noise. The variation of $E$ itself across the population gives rise to extrinsic noise.\n\nTo find the moments of the distribution of $X$ over the entire population, we use the law of total expectation and the law of total variance.\n\nFirst, we find the total mean protein number, $\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X]$, using the law of total expectation:\n$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X|E]] $$\nSubstituting the expression for the conditional mean:\n$$ \\mu = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{k_0 E}{\\gamma}\\right] = \\frac{k_0}{\\gamma} \\mathbb{E}[E] $$\nThe problem states that $\\mathbb{E}[E] = 1$. Therefore, the total mean is:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{k_0}{\\gamma} $$\n\nNext, we find the total variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(X)$, using the law of total variance:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X|E)] + \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X|E]) $$\nThe first term, $\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X|E)]$, represents the average intrinsic variance.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X|E)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{k_0 E}{\\gamma}\\right] = \\frac{k_0}{\\gamma} \\mathbb{E}[E] = \\frac{k_0}{\\gamma} = \\mu $$\nThe second term, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X|E])$, represents the extrinsic variance, which arises from the variation of the conditional mean.\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X|E]) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{k_0 E}{\\gamma}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{k_0}{\\gamma}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(E) $$\nUsing $\\mu = k_0/\\gamma$ and the given $\\operatorname{Var}(E) = \\sigma_E^2$, this term becomes:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X|E]) = \\mu^2 \\sigma_E^2 $$\nSumming the two terms, the total variance is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\mu + \\mu^2 \\sigma_E^2 $$\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for the coefficient of variation squared, $CV^2$, defined as $\\operatorname{Var}(X)/\\mathbb{E}[X]^2$.\n$$ CV^2 = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(X)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{\\mu + \\mu^2 \\sigma_E^2}{\\mu^2} $$\n$$ CV^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu} + \\sigma_E^2 $$\nThis is the derived expression. It shows that the total noise ($CV^2$) is a sum of the intrinsic noise component ($1/\\mu$) and the extrinsic noise component ($\\sigma_E^2$).\n\nNow, we use the provided experimental data to compute the value of $\\sigma_E^2$.\nWe have two conditions:\n1.  Baseline condition: degradation rate $\\gamma$, mean $\\mu_1 = 50$, and noise $CV_1^2 = 0.0500$.\n2.  Perturbed condition: degradation rate $2\\gamma$, mean $\\mu_2 = 25$, and noise $CV_2^2 = 0.0700$.\n\nThe model predicts that $\\mu_2 = k_0/(2\\gamma) = (1/2)(k_0/\\gamma) = \\mu_1/2$. The data is consistent with this prediction, as $25 = 50/2$. The extrinsic factor distribution, and thus $\\sigma_E^2$, is unchanged by the perturbation.\n\nWe can set up a system of two equations using our derived formula:\nFor the baseline condition:\n$$ CV_1^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\sigma_E^2 \\implies 0.0500 = \\frac{1}{50} + \\sigma_E^2 $$\nFor the perturbed condition:\n$$ CV_2^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + \\sigma_E^2 \\implies 0.0700 = \\frac{1}{25} + \\sigma_E^2 $$\nWe can solve for $\\sigma_E^2$ using either equation. Using the first equation:\n$$ \\sigma_E^2 = 0.0500 - \\frac{1}{50} = 0.0500 - 0.0200 = 0.0300 $$\nUsing the second equation as a check:\n$$ \\sigma_E^2 = 0.0700 - \\frac{1}{25} = 0.0700 - 0.0400 = 0.0300 $$\nBoth equations yield the identical result, confirming the consistency of the model with the provided data.\n\nThe numeric value of $\\sigma_E^2$ is $0.03$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $0.03$ with four significant figures, we write it as $0.03000$.",
