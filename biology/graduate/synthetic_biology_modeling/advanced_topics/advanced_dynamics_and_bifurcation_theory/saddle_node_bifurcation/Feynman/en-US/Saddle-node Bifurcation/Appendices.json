Your task is to construct the simplest non-trivial polynomial function $f(x, r)$ that causes the system to undergo a saddle-node bifurcation at the critical point $(x_c, r_c) = (5, 1)$. For the purposes of this problem, the \"simplest\" function is defined as a polynomial that is at most linear in the parameter $r$ and at most quadratic in the state variable $x$. Provide the explicit form of $f(x, r)$.",
            "solution": "A saddle-node bifurcation occurs at a point $(x_c, r_c)$ if the following conditions are met for the function $f(x, r)$:\n1.  The point is a fixed point at the critical parameter value: $f(x_c, r_c) = 0$.\n2.  The fixed point is non-hyperbolic: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_c, r_c) = 0$.\n3.  The parameter variation moves the fixed point branch: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}(x_c, r_c) \\neq 0$.\n4.  The curvature is non-zero, which distinguishes it from other bifurcations like the pitchfork bifurcation: $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(x_c, r_c) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe problem states that the function $f(x, r)$ is at most linear in $r$ and quadratic in $x$. The most general form for such a polynomial can be expressed conveniently by centering it around the bifurcation point $(x_c, r_c) = (5, 1)$:\n$$f(x, r) = c_0 + c_1(r - 1) + c_2(x - 5) + c_3(x - 5)^2 + c_4(r-1)(x-5)$$\nThe term $c_4(r-1)(x-5)$ is often omitted in the simplest normal form, so we will set $c_4=0$ to seek the simplest polynomial. Our form is thus:\n$$f(x, r) = c_0 + c_1(r - 1) + c_2(x - 5) + c_3(x - 5)^2$$\n\nNow, we apply the bifurcation conditions to determine the coefficients $c_i$.\n\n**Condition 1:** $f(5, 1) = 0$.\nSubstituting $x=5$ and $r=1$ into our expression for $f(x, r)$:\n$$f(5, 1) = c_0 + c_1(1-1) + c_2(5-5) + c_3(5-5)^2 = c_0$$\nThus, we must have $c_0 = 0$.\n\n**Condition 2:** $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(5, 1) = 0$.\nFirst, we compute the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = c_2 + 2c_3(x-5)$$\nEvaluating this at $(x, r) = (5, 1)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(5, 1) = c_2 + 2c_3(5-5) = c_2$$\nThus, we must have $c_2 = 0$.\n\nWith $c_0=0$ and $c_2=0$, our function simplifies to:\n$$f(x, r) = c_1(r - 1) + c_3(x - 5)^2$$\n\n**Condition 3:** $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}(5, 1) \\neq 0$.\nWe compute the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r} = c_1$$\nThis is a constant. The condition requires $c_1 \\neq 0$.\n\n**Condition 4:** $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(5, 1) \\neq 0$.\nWe compute the second partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2c_3$$\nThis is also a constant. The condition requires $2c_3 \\neq 0$, which means $c_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nSo we need a function of the form $f(x, r) = c_1(r - 1) + c_3(x - 5)^2$ with $c_1 \\neq 0$ and $c_3 \\neq 0$. The problem asks for the \"simplest non-trivial\" function. This suggests choosing the simplest non-zero integer values for the coefficients. The canonical form of the saddle-node bifurcation is often written as $\\dot{x} = r - x^2$. To match this structure, we can choose $c_1 = 1$ and $c_3 = -1$. These are the simplest integers that satisfy the non-zero conditions.\n\nWith these choices, the function becomes:\n$$f(x, r) = (1)(r - 1) + (-1)(x - 5)^2 = r - 1 - (x - 5)^2$$\n\nTo express this as a standard polynomial, we expand the squared term:\n$$f(x, r) = r - 1 - (x^2 - 10x + 25)$$\n$$f(x, r) = r - 1 - x^2 + 10x - 25$$\n$$f(x, r) = r - x^2 + 10x - 26$$\n\nThis function satisfies all the required conditions and meets the definition of \"simplest\" as specified in the problem statement.",
