It is complete, consistent, realistic within the context of modeling, and requires non-trivial analytical reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement. The system is described by the one-dimensional flow on the line given by the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, \\mu) = \\mu - x^{2}\n$$\n\n**1. Determination of Equilibria**\n\nEquilibria, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, are the states where the system does not change in time, i.e., $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting the right-hand side of the ODE to zero gives the condition for the equilibria:\n$$\nf(x^{\\ast}, \\mu) = \\mu - (x^{\\ast})^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $x^{\\ast}$ yields:\n$$\n(x^{\\ast})^{2} = \\mu\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}\n$$\nThese equilibria are real-valued only if the parameter $\\mu$ is non-negative. We analyze the number of equilibria based on the value of $\\mu$:\n- If $\\mu  0$, there are no real solutions for $x^{\\ast}$, and thus the system has **no equilibria**.\n- If $\\mu = 0$, there is exactly **one equilibrium** at $x^{\\ast} = 0$.\n- If $\\mu  0$, there are **two distinct equilibria**: $x^{\\ast}_{1} = +\\sqrt{\\mu}$ and $x^{\\ast}_{2} = -\\sqrt{\\mu}$.\n\n**2. Stability Classification of Equilibria**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ in a one-dimensional system is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x, \\mu)$ with respect to $x$, evaluated at the equilibrium. This derivative corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the linearized system.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=x^{\\ast}}\n$$\nAn equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if $\\lambda  0$ and unstable if $\\lambda  0$. If $\\lambda=0$, the equilibrium is non-hyperbolic, and linear stability analysis is inconclusive.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\mu - x^{2}) = -2x\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the equilibria for the case $\\mu  0$:\n- For the equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{1} = +\\sqrt{\\mu}$:\n  $$\n  \\lambda_{1} = -2x^{\\ast}_{1} = -2\\sqrt{\\mu}\n  $$\n  Since $\\mu  0$, $\\sqrt{\\mu}$ is a positive real number, which implies $\\lambda_{1}  0$. Therefore, the equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{1} = +\\sqrt{\\mu}$ is **stable**.\n- For the equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{2} = -\\sqrt{\\mu}$:\n  $$\n  \\lambda_{2} = -2x^{\\ast}_{2} = -2(-\\sqrt{\\mu}) = 2\\sqrt{\\mu}\n  $$\n  Since $\\mu  0$, we have $\\lambda_{2}  0$. Therefore, the equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{2} = -\\sqrt{\\mu}$ is **unstable**.\n\nFor the case $\\mu = 0$, the single equilibrium is $x^{\\ast} = 0$:\n- For the equilibrium $x^{\\ast} = 0$:\n  $$\n  \\lambda = -2(0) = 0\n  $$\n  The eigenvalue is zero, indicating a non-hyperbolic equilibrium. This is the condition under which a bifurcation can occur.\n\n**3. Bifurcation Analysis**\n\nA qualitative change in the dynamics (specifically, in the number of equilibria) occurs as $\\mu$ passes through $0$. Thus, the critical parameter value is $\\mu_{c} = 0$. At this point, the stable equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{1}$ and the unstable equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_{2}$ merge and annihilate. This is the characteristic behavior of a saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nTo provide a rigorous justification that this is a nondegenerate saddle-node bifurcation, we must verify the standard conditions at the bifurcation point $(x_{c}, \\mu_{c}) = (0, 0)$:\nLet $f(x, \\mu) = \\mu - x^2$. A saddle-node bifurcation occurs at $(x_c, \\mu_c)$ if the following conditions are met:\n1.  (Equilibrium Condition) $f(x_c, \\mu_c) = 0$\n2.  (Zero Eigenvalue Condition) $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_c, \\mu_c) = 0$\n3.  (Transversality Condition) $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu}(x_c, \\mu_c) \\neq 0$\n4.  (Non-degeneracy Condition) $\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}(x_c, \\mu_c) \\neq 0$\n\nWe check these conditions for our system at $(x_c, \\mu_c) = (0, 0)$:\n1.  $f(0, 0) = 0 - 0^2 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -2x$. At $(0,0)$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(0,0) = -2(0) = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n3.  $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu}(\\mu - x^2) = 1$. At $(0,0)$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu}(0,0) = 1 \\neq 0$. The condition is satisfied. This ensures that the parameter $\\mu$ effectively shifts the graph of $f(x)$ vertically, causing the equilibria to appear or disappear.\n4.  $\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-2x) = -2$. At $(0,0)$, $\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}(0,0) = -2 \\neq 0$. The condition is satisfied. This ensures that the function has a quadratic, parabolic shape near the equilibrium, not a higher-order inflection point.\n\nAll four conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation are satisfied at $(x_c, \\mu_c) = (0,0)$.\n\nThe problem also asks why higher-order terms do not nullify this qualitative change. The given equation, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\mu - x^2$, is the *normal form* of the saddle-node bifurcation. This means it is the simplest polynomial form that captures the dynamics near the bifurcation point after all non-essential terms have been removed via coordinate transformations (which are guaranteed to exist by the Center Manifold Theorem). The non-degeneracy conditions, specifically $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} \\neq 0$, guarantee the local dynamics are dominated by the quadratic term. Taylor expanding a general function $g(x, \\mu)$ near the bifurcation point $(x_c, \\mu_c)$ satisfying the first two conditions gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} \\approx g_{\\mu}(y, \\nu) \\nu + \\frac{1}{2} g_{xx}(y, \\nu) y^2 + \\dots\n$$\nwhere $y = x - x_c$ and $\\nu = \\mu - \\mu_c$. As long as $g_{\\mu} \\neq 0$ and $g_{xx} \\neq 0$, the signs of these leading terms determine the local geometry of the bifurcation, which is that of a parabola in the $(\\mu, x)$ plane. This structure is robust to small perturbations, meaning the bifurcation is structurally stable. The non-vanishing second derivative ensures the parabolic opening, and thus the birth/death of equilibria, cannot be undone by higher-order terms (e.g., $x^3, x^4, \\dots$), which are smaller in magnitude closer to the bifurcation point.\n\nThe critical parameter value at which the bifurcation occurs is therefore $\\mu_c=0$.",

At each step $k$, one solves $f(x, p_k) = 0$ for $x_k$. This method fails at a turning point (fold bifurcation). At such a point, a branch of solutions $(x(p), p)$ \"turns back\" with respect to $p$. Mathematically, the Jacobian matrix $J = \\partial f/\\partial x$ becomes singular, and Newton's method, the standard solver for $f(x,p)=0$, which requires inverting $J$, becomes ill-conditioned and fails.\n\nTo robustly trace a curve through a turning point, the curve must be reparameterized. Instead of using $p$ as the parameter, we use a parameter that tracks the progression along the curve itself, such as arclength, denoted by $s$. This leads to a predictor-corrector method known as **pseudo-arclength continuation**.\n\n**1. Predictor Step**: Given a point $(x_k, p_k)$ on the solution curve, the first step is to predict the next point by moving a small step $\\Delta s$ along the tangent to the curve. The tangent vector $(\\dot{x}, \\dot{p}) = (\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}s, \\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}s)$ is found by differentiating the steady-state equation $f(x(s), p(s)) = 0$ with respect to $s$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{ds}f(x(s), p(s)) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} \\frac{dp}{ds} = 0 $$\n$$ J(x_k, p_k) \\dot{x} + f_p(x_k, p_k) \\dot{p} = 0 $$\nwhere $f_p = \\partial f/\\partial p$. This is a linear system of $n$ equations for $n+1$ unknowns, defining a $1$-dimensional solution space (the tangent line). A unique tangent vector is obtained by adding a normalization constraint, typically $||\\dot{x}||^2 + |\\dot{p}|^2 = 1$. The predictor step is then:\n$$ (x_{\\text{pred}}, p_{\\text{pred}}) = (x_k, p_k) + \\Delta s \\cdot (\\dot{x}, \\dot{p}) $$\n\n**2. Corrector Step**: The predicted point $(x_{\\text{pred}}, p_{\\text{pred}})$ is generally not exactly on the solution curve. A corrector step is needed to return to the curve. We must solve for a new point $(x_{k+1}, p_{k+1})$ that satisfies $f(x, p) = 0$ and is \"close\" to the predicted point. To do this, we solve an augmented system of $n+1$ equations for the $n+1$ unknowns $(x, p)$. The system consists of the original $n$ equations and one additional constraint. A common and effective constraint is the pseudo-arclength constraint, which forces the displacement vector from the previous point to be a fixed \"distance\" $\\Delta s$ in the direction of the tangent:\n$$ (x - x_k)^T \\dot{x} + (p - p_k) \\dot{p} = \\Delta s $$\nThe full system to be solved by Newton's method is:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}(x, p) = \\begin{pmatrix} f(x, p) \\\\ (x - x_k)^T \\dot{x} + (p - p_k) \\dot{p} - \\Delta s \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\nThe Jacobian of this augmented system, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{aug}}$, is generally non-singular even when $J = \\partial f/\\partial x$ is singular, which is the key to passing the turning point.\n\n**3. Turning Point Detection**: A turning point is defined by the singularity of $J = \\partial f/\\partial x$. As stated, its nullity increases from $0$ to $1$. Numerically, this is best detected by monitoring the smallest singular value of $J$, denoted $\\sigma_{\\min}(J)$, which is computed via the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). As the continuation proceeds along the curve, $\\sigma_{\\min}(J)$ is a continuous function. A turning point is crossed when $\\sigma_{\\min}(J)$ passes through (or near) zero.\nAt a generic fold, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Singularity**: $\\text{rank}(J) = n-1$. This means $J$ has a one-dimensional nullspace, spanned by a right nullvector $v$ ($Jv = 0, v \\neq 0$), and a one-dimensional left nullspace, spanned by a left nullvector $u$ ($u^T J = 0, u \\neq 0$). These vectors are available from the SVD.\n2.  **Transversality**: $u^T f_p \\neq 0$. This condition ensures that the curve is genuinely folding with respect to the parameter $p$.\n\nTherefore, a robust detection method involves monitoring $\\sigma_{\\min}(J)$ and, upon its near-zero-crossing, verifying the transversality condition.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use a pseudo-arclength predictor-corrector scheme: obtain the tangent direction $(\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}s,\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}s)$ at a computed equilibrium by differentiating $f(x(s),p(s))=0$ with respect to arclength $s$ to satisfy $J(x,p)\\,\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}s + f_p(x,p)\\,\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}s = 0$, together with a normalization constraint to fix the scale; take a small step along the tangent as a predictor; then apply Newton iterations to the augmented system consisting of $f(x,p)=0$ and a linearized pseudo-arclength constraint to correct back onto the branch. Detect turning points by monitoring the nullity of $J(x,p)$ via its smallest singular value and associated singular vectors: near a fold, the smallest singular value approaches $0$, a one-dimensional kernel emerges, and a nonzero inner product between the corresponding left nullvector and $f_p(x,p)$ confirms a generic turning point.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option provides a complete and accurate description of the pseudo-arclength continuation method, including the predictor step (tangent calculation), the corrector step (solving an augmented system), and the detection of turning points. The detection method, based on monitoring the smallest singular value of $J$ and testing the transversality condition ($u^T f_p \\neq 0$), is the state-of-the-art, numerically robust way to identify a fold bifurcation, consistent with the problem's requirement to monitor the nullity of $J$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Increment $p$ by small fixed steps and at each $p$ solve $f(x,p)=0$ by Newton’s method using the previous equilibrium as the initial guess; detect turning points by monitoring $\\det(J(x,p))$, declaring a fold when $\\det(J)$ changes sign.**\n-   **Analysis**: This describes a simple parameter continuation. As established, this method is not robust and fails to pass turning points because Newton's method fails when $J$ becomes singular. The problem explicitly requires a method to \"robustly pass\" these points. While monitoring the sign of $\\det(J)$ can detect the passage through a singularity (where $\\det(J)=0$), the underlying continuation method is inadequate for the task.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Slowly vary $p$ in time and integrate the ODE forward until a steady state is approached; use the Hessian $\\partial^2 f/\\partial x^2$ to monitor changes in nullity and declare a turning point when the Hessian develops a nontrivial nullspace.**\n-   **Analysis**: This describes time-dependent simulation, not a method for tracing equilibrium branches. This approach can only find stable equilibria and cannot follow unstable branches, which typically exist after a fold bifurcation. Furthermore, the detection criterion is incorrect. A fold bifurcation is a property of the Jacobian ($J = \\partial f/\\partial x$), not the Hessian matrix ($\\partial^2 f/\\partial x^2$). The condition for a fold is a singularity in $J$, not the Hessian.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use pseudo-arclength predictor-corrector as in A, but detect turning points by monitoring the nullity of the augmented Jacobian of the corrector system; declare a fold when the augmented Jacobian becomes singular.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies pseudo-arclength continuation as the appropriate method. However, the detection criterion is flawed. The purpose of the augmented system is precisely that its Jacobian, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{aug}}$, remains non-singular at the fold point of the original system. A singularity in $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{aug}}$ corresponds to a higher-order bifurcation (like a branch point), not a standard turning point. The turning point is defined by the singularity of the original, un-augmented Jacobian $J = \\partial f/\\partial x$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Compute the eigenvalues of the ODE Jacobian $\\partial g/\\partial x$ at equilibria and declare a turning point when a complex conjugate pair crosses the imaginary axis, indicating a loss of stability.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option confuses two different types of bifurcations. A turning point (fold bifurcation) occurs when a single real eigenvalue of the Jacobian $J$ crosses zero. The event described—a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis—is a Hopf bifurcation, which signals the onset of oscillations (a limit cycle), not a turning point in the steady-state curve. The task is specifically to find turning points.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
