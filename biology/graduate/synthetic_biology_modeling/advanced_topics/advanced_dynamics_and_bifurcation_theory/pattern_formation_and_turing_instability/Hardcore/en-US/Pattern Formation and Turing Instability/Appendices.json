It is a standard, well-posed problem in the linear stability analysis of reaction-diffusion systems. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe analysis of a diffusion-driven instability, also known as a Turing instability, proceeds by examining the stability of the system to spatial perturbations. We consider a single Fourier mode for the perturbations $(\\delta u, \\delta v)$ of the form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\delta u(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\\\\\delta v(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\tilde{u} \\\\\\tilde{v}\\end{pmatrix} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + \\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}$ is the spatial wavevector, $t$ is time, $\\begin{pmatrix}\\tilde{u} \\\\\\tilde{v}\\end{pmatrix}$ is the constant amplitude vector of the mode, and $\\lambda$ is the temporal growth rate. The Laplacian operator acting on this spatial mode yields $\\nabla^2 \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) = -|\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) = -k^2 \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$, where $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ is the spatial wavenumber.\n\nSubstituting this form into the governing partial differential equation system gives an algebraic eigenvalue problem for the growth rate $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda \\begin{pmatrix}\\tilde{u} \\\\\\tilde{v}\\end{pmatrix} = J \\begin{pmatrix}\\tilde{u} \\\\\\tilde{v}\\end{pmatrix} - k^2 \\begin{pmatrix}D_{u} & 0\\\\ 0 & D_{v}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\tilde{u} \\\\\\tilde{v}\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\left( J - k^2 D - \\lambda I \\right) \\begin{pmatrix}\\tilde{u} \\\\\\tilde{v}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $D = \\begin{pmatrix}D_{u} & 0\\\\ 0 & D_{v}\\end{pmatrix}$ and $I$ is the identity matrix. For a non-trivial solution to exist, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. Let's define the stability matrix for a given wavenumber $k$ as $M(k^2) = J - k^2 D$.\n$$\nM(k^2) = \\begin{pmatrix}a - k^2 D_u & b\\\\ c & d - k^2 D_v\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda(k^2)$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(M(k^2) - \\lambda I) = 0$, which is:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(M(k^2)) \\lambda + \\det(M(k^2)) = 0\n$$\n\nA Turing instability requires two conditions:\n1.  The spatially homogeneous steady state must be stable in the absence of diffusion (when $k=0$).\n2.  Diffusion must destabilize the system for a certain range of non-zero wavenumbers ($k^2 > 0$).\n\n**Condition 1: Stability of the homogeneous state ($k=0$)**\nFor $k=0$, the stability matrix is just the Jacobian $J$. The system is stable if all eigenvalues of $J$ have negative real parts. For a $2 \\times 2$ system, this requires $\\text{tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\det(J) > 0$.\nThe given Jacobian entries are $a=1$, $b=-3$, $c=1$, $d=-2$. Let's verify these conditions:\n$$\n\\text{tr}(J) = a+d = 1 + (-2) = -1\n$$\nSince $\\text{tr}(J) = -1 < 0$, the first stability condition is met.\n$$\n\\det(J) = ad-bc = (1)(-2) - (-3)(1) = -2 + 3 = 1\n$$\nSince $\\det(J) = 1 > 0$, the second stability condition is also met. Thus, the problem statement that the well-mixed fixed point is linearly stable is consistent with the provided data.\n\n**Condition 2: Diffusion-driven instability ($k^2 > 0$)**\nFor the system to be unstable for some $k^2 > 0$, at least one eigenvalue $\\lambda(k^2)$ must have a positive real part, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda(k^2)) > 0$. The eigenvalues are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm}(k^2) = \\frac{\\text{tr}(M(k^2)) \\pm \\sqrt{\\text{tr}(M(k^2))^2 - 4\\det(M(k^2))}}{2}\n$$\nLet's analyze the trace of $M(k^2)$:\n$$\n\\text{tr}(M(k^2)) = (a - k^2 D_u) + (d - k^2 D_v) = (a+d) - k^2(D_u + D_v) = \\text{tr}(J) - k^2(D_u + D_v)\n$$\nSince $\\text{tr}(J) = -1 < 0$, and $D_u, D_v, k^2$ are all positive, $\\text{tr}(M(k^2))$ is always negative for any $k^2 \\ge 0$.\nIf the eigenvalues are complex conjugates, their real part is $\\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}(M(k^2))$, which is always negative. Therefore, instability cannot arise from complex eigenvalues (i.e., spiraling modes cannot grow).\nInstability can only occur if the eigenvalues are real and at least one is positive. Since their sum, $\\lambda_+ + \\lambda_- = \\text{tr}(M(k^2))$, is negative, if one eigenvalue is positive, the other must be negative. This implies that their product must be negative. The product of eigenvalues is the determinant:\n$$\n\\lambda_+ \\lambda_- = \\det(M(k^2))\n$$\nThus, the condition for instability is $\\det(M(k^2)) < 0$ for some range of $k^2 > 0$.\n\nLet's compute the determinant of $M(k^2)$:\n$$\n\\det(M(k^2)) = (a - k^2 D_u)(d - k^2 D_v) - bc\n$$\n$$\n\\det(M(k^2)) = ad - k^2(aD_v + dD_u) + k^4 D_u D_v - bc\n$$\n$$\n\\det(M(k^2)) = (ad-bc) - (aD_v + dD_u)k^2 + (D_u D_v)k^4\n$$\nLet $K = k^2$. The determinant is a quadratic function of $K$:\n$$\nP(K) = (D_u D_v)K^2 - (aD_v + dD_u)K + \\det(J)\n$$\nWe need to find conditions for which $P(K) < 0$ for some $K > 0$. $P(K)$ is an upward-opening parabola in $K$. At $K=0$, $P(0)=\\det(J)=1 > 0$. For the parabola to dip below the horizontal axis for $K>0$, it must have a minimum at some $K_{min} > 0$, and the value at this minimum, $P(K_{min})$, must be negative.\n\nThe vertex (minimum) of the parabola occurs at:\n$$\nK_{min} = \\frac{aD_v + dD_u}{2D_uD_v}\n$$\nFor $K_{min} > 0$, we require the numerator to be positive:\n$$\naD_v + dD_u > 0\n$$\nThe value of the parabola at its minimum is negative if the quadratic equation $P(K)=0$ has two distinct real roots. The condition for this is that the discriminant of the quadratic $P(K)$ is positive:\n$$\n\\Delta_K = (aD_v + dD_u)^2 - 4(D_u D_v)\\det(J) > 0\n$$\nNow we introduce the ratio $\\mathcal{R} = D_v/D_u$ and apply the two derived conditions.\n\n1.  From $aD_v + dD_u > 0$, we substitute $a=1, d=-2$:\n    $1 \\cdot D_v - 2 \\cdot D_u > 0 \\implies D_v > 2 D_u \\implies \\frac{D_v}{D_u} > 2$.\n    So, $\\mathcal{R} > 2$.\n\n2.  From $(aD_v + dD_u)^2 - 4D_uD_v\\det(J) > 0$, we substitute the known values:\n    $(1 \\cdot D_v - 2 \\cdot D_u)^2 - 4D_uD_v(1) > 0$\n    Divide the inequality by $D_u^2 > 0$:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{D_v}{D_u} - 2\\right)^2 - 4\\frac{D_v}{D_u} > 0\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\mathcal{R} = D_v/D_u$:\n    $$\n    (\\mathcal{R}-2)^2 - 4\\mathcal{R} > 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{R}^2 - 4\\mathcal{R} + 4 - 4\\mathcal{R} > 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{R}^2 - 8\\mathcal{R} + 4 > 0\n    $$\n    To solve this quadratic inequality, we find the roots of the corresponding equation $\\mathcal{R}^2 - 8\\mathcal{R} + 4 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{-(-8) \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{48}}{2}\n    $$\n    Simplifying $\\sqrt{48} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}\n    $$\n    The parabola $\\mathcal{R}^2 - 8\\mathcal{R} + 4$ opens upwards, so the inequality is satisfied when $\\mathcal{R}$ is outside the roots:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{R} < 4 - 2\\sqrt{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mathcal{R} > 4 + 2\\sqrt{3}\n    $$\n    To obtain the final condition, we must satisfy both derived constraints simultaneously. We require $\\mathcal{R} > 2$ AND ($\\mathcal{R} < 4 - 2\\sqrt{3}$ or $\\mathcal{R} > 4 + 2\\sqrt{3}$).\n    Let's approximate the roots' values:\n    $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n    $4 - 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 4 - 2(1.732) = 4 - 3.464 = 0.536$\n    $4 + 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 4 + 3.464 = 7.464$\n    The condition $\\mathcal{R} > 2$ is incompatible with $\\mathcal{R} < 4 - 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 0.536$.\n    The condition $\\mathcal{R} > 2$ is compatible with $\\mathcal{R} > 4 + 2\\sqrt{3} \\approx 7.464$. The intersection of these two conditions is simply:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{R} > 4 + 2\\sqrt{3}\n    $$\n    This inequality defines the range of the diffusion coefficient ratio $D_v/D_u$ for which a diffusion-driven instability can occur. The problem asks for the minimum ratio required for such an instability band to exist. This corresponds to the infimum of the set of allowed ratios, which is the boundary value.\n\nTherefore, the minimum required ratio is $4+2\\sqrt{3}$.",

The discrete Laplacian at grid point $(i,j)$ is given by:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{i+1,j} + \\phi_{i-1,j} + \\phi_{i,j+1} + \\phi_{i,j-1} - 4\\phi_{i,j}}{dx^2} $$\n  - **Reaction Term:** The Schnakenberg kinetics, $f(u,v) = a - u + u^2 v$ and $g(u,v) = b - u^2 v$, are computed element-wise for the current $u$ and $v$ matrices.\n  - **Update:** The $u$ and $v$ fields are updated according to the Forward Euler formula:\n    $$ u_{t+dt} = u_t + dt \\left( D_u \\nabla^2 u_t + f(u_t, v_t) \\right) $$\n    $$ v_{t+dt} = v_t + dt \\left( D_v \\nabla^2 v_t + g(u_t, v_t) \\right) $$\n\n**2. Pattern Detection Analysis**\nAfter the simulation concludes at time $T=160$, the final activator field, $u(x,y,T)$, is analyzed using two metrics.\n\n- **$M_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ (Power Spectrum Peak):** This metric quantifies the prominence of a characteristic wavelength.\n  1. The $2D$ Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the final $u$ field is computed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n  2. The power spectrum is calculated as the squared magnitude of the DFT: $P(k_x, k_y) = |\\mathrm{DFT}(u)(k_x, k_y)|^2$.\n  3. The $2D$ power spectrum is radially averaged to produce a $1D$ spectrum $S(k)$, where $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ is the scalar wavenumber. This is achieved by binning the values of $P(k_x, k_y)$ based on their corresponding $k$ and averaging within each bin. The DC component ($k=0$) is excluded from this process.\n  4. The metric $M_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ is computed as the ratio of the maximum value of the binned spectrum $S(k)$ to its median value. A high ratio indicates a strong peak corresponding to a dominant spatial frequency.\n\n- **$M_{\\mathrm{ac}}$ (Spatial Autocorrelation):** This metric measures the spatial periodicity of the pattern.\n  1. The spatial autocorrelation function $C(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ is computed using the Wiener–Khinchin theorem. The power spectrum of the zero-mean activator field, $u' = u - \\langle u \\rangle$, is calculated, and its inverse FFT yields the autocorrelation function.\n  2. The $2D$ autocorrelation function is radially averaged to produce a $1D$ function $C(r)$, where $r = \\sqrt{\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2}$ is the spatial lag. This binning process is analogous to that used for the power spectrum.\n  3. The metric $M_{\\mathrm{ac}}$ is the ratio of the maximum of the radially averaged autocorrelation for non-zero lags, $\\max_{r>0} C(r)$, to the autocorrelation at zero lag, $C(0)$. A high ratio indicates that the field is strongly correlated at a characteristic distance, a hallmark of a pattern.\n\n**3. Classification**\nFor each tested parameter set, the calculated metrics $M_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{ac}}$ are compared against their respective thresholds, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 4.0$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ac}} = 0.1$. A classification of 'pattern-forming' (True) is assigned if and only if both conditions, $M_{\\mathrm{peak}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{ac}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{ac}}$, are met. Otherwise, the classification is 'non-pattern-forming' (False). The final output is a list of these boolean results.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-species reaction–diffusion model for a synthetic gene circuit, linearized around a spatially homogeneous fixed point. Let the state perturbation be $(u,v)$ and the local Jacobian matrix at the fixed point be $J=\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{pmatrix}$, with diffusion coefficients $D_u$ for $u$ and $D_v$ for $v$. After spatial Fourier transform, the growth matrix for mode $k$ (nondimensional wavenumber) is $A(k)=J-k^2\\operatorname{diag}(D_u,D_v)$, and the growth rates are the eigenvalues of $A(k)$.\n\nFundamental base:\n- The reaction–diffusion linearization yields the characteristic polynomial for each $k$ as $\\lambda^2-\\tau_k\\lambda+\\Delta_k=0$, where $\\tau_k=\\tau-(D_u+D_v)k^2$, $\\Delta_k=\\Delta-(aD_v+dD_u)k^2+D_uD_vk^4$, with $\\tau=a+d$ and $\\Delta=ad-bc$.\n- Diffusion-driven (Turing) instability requires that the homogeneous fixed point is linearly stable without diffusion for all parameter realizations, and that diffusion creates a band of wavenumbers $k$ with at least one growth rate having positive real part.\n\nYou are given interval uncertainty bounds for the entries of $J$ and the diffusion coefficients $D_u$ and $D_v$. Define the uncertainty set $\\mathcal{U}$ as all $(a,b,c,d,D_u,D_v)$ with $a\\in[a_{\\min},a_{\\max}]$, $b\\in[b_{\\min},b_{\\max}]$, $c\\in[c_{\\min},c_{\\max}]$, $d\\in[d_{\\min},d_{\\max}]$, $D_u\\in[D_{u,\\min},D_{u,\\max}]$, and $D_v\\in[D_{v,\\min},D_{v,\\max}]$.\n\nTask:\n1. Robust stability without diffusion: Verify that $\\tau<0$ and $\\Delta>0$ for all $J$ in the given uncertainty box. Equivalently, require $a_{\\max}+d_{\\max}<0$ and $\\inf_{(a,b,c,d)\\in\\text{box}}(ad-bc)>0$. The infimum over a hyperrectangle occurs at a corner; compute it by evaluating $ad-bc$ at all corners of the $J$-box.\n2. Robust Turing instability under diffusion: For each parameter realization, the instability band is the set of $k$ such that $\\Delta_k<0$ (since $\\tau<0$ implies $\\tau_k<0$ for all $k$, so positivity of the largest eigenvalue arises when $\\Delta_k<0$). Write $\\Delta_k$ as a quadratic in $x=k^2$: $\\Delta(x)=\\Delta-\\alpha x+\\beta x^2$ with $\\alpha=aD_v+dD_u$ and $\\beta=D_uD_v$. For a given parameter realization, an instability band exists when $\\alpha>0$ and $\\alpha^2-4\\beta\\Delta>0$, and the band endpoints in $x$ are $x_1=(\\alpha-\\sqrt{\\alpha^2-4\\beta\\Delta})/(2\\beta)$ and $x_2=(\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\alpha^2-4\\beta\\Delta})/(2\\beta)$; the corresponding $k$-interval is $(\\sqrt{\\max(0,x_1)},\\sqrt{x_2})$.\n3.

Sensitivity discussion: Quantify how errors in estimating $J$ affect the robust band by analyzing the dependence of $x_1$ and $x_2$ on $a$, $d$, $b$, and $c$ via $\\Delta$ and $\\alpha$. In particular, comment on how tightening or loosening the bounds on $J$ changes the intersection and thus the robustness.\n\nYour program must implement this procedure and operate on the following test suite of parameter boxes, covering a general case, a boundary case, and an edge case:\n\n- Test case $1$ (general \"happy path\"):\n  - $a\\in[-0.8,-0.6]$, $b\\in[1.6,2.0]$, $c\\in[-1.5,-1.1]$, $d\\in[-0.4,-0.2]$,\n  - $D_u\\in[0.01,0.02]$, $D_v\\in[0.7,0.9]$.\n- Test case $2$ (boundary robustness failure due to near-loss of stability):\n  - $a\\in[-0.3,0.05]$, $b\\in[0.8,1.0]$, $c\\in[-0.9,-0.7]$, $d\\in[-0.2,0.02]$,\n  - $D_u\\in[0.01,0.02]$, $D_v\\in[0.3,0.5]$.\n- Test case $3$ (edge case with identical diffusion coefficients):\n  - $a\\in[-0.8,-0.6]$, $b\\in[1.6,2.0]$, $c\\in[-1.5,-1.1]$, $d\\in[-0.4,-0.2]$,\n  - $D_u\\in[0.05,0.05]$, $D_v\\in[0.05,0.05]$.\n\nAll quantities are nondimensional.

The linearization, stability analysis via eigenvalues, and the conditions for diffusion-driven instability ($\\tau<0, \\Delta>0, \\Delta_k<0$ for some $k>0$) are all standard and correct. The problem is well-posed, providing a specific, albeit approximate, method (corner analysis) for handling parameter uncertainty, making the task computationally well-defined and objective. The tasks are formalizable and directly relevant to the topic. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Principled Solution Design\n\nThe solution will proceed by implementing the multi-step analysis prescribed in the problem for each test case.\n\n**1. Robust Stability of the Homogeneous System**\n\nA diffusion-driven instability, by definition, arises from a system that is stable in the absence of diffusion. For robustness, this stability must hold for all possible parameter values within the specified uncertainty box $\\mathcal{U}$. The linear stability of the homogeneous system (where $k=0$) is governed by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ satisfy $\\lambda^2 - \\tau\\lambda + \\Delta = 0$, where $\\tau = \\text{tr}(J) = a+d$ and $\\Delta = \\text{det}(J) = ad-bc$. For stability, both eigenvalues must have negative real parts, which, according to the Routh-Hurwitz criteria, requires $\\tau < 0$ and $\\Delta > 0$.\n\nTo ensure these conditions hold robustly over the parameter box, we must verify:\n- $\\sup_{\\mathcal{U}} \\tau < 0$: The maximum value of $\\tau = a+d$ occurs when $a=a_{\\max}$ and $d=d_{\\max}$. Thus, we must check if $a_{\\max} + d_{\\max} < 0$.\n- $\\inf_{\\mathcal{U}} \\Delta > 0$: The infimum of $\\Delta = ad-bc$ over the four-dimensional hyperrectangle for $(a, b, c, d)$ occurs at one of its $2^4 = 16$ vertices. We will compute $\\Delta$ at each vertex and verify that the minimum value is strictly positive.\n\nIf either of these conditions is violated for a given test case, the system is not robustly stable, and the premise for robust Turing instability is not met. In such a case, the robust Turing region $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{robust}}$ is empty.\n\n**2. Condition for Diffusion-Driven Instability**\n\nWith diffusion, the system's evolution for a spatial mode with wavenumber $k$ is governed by the eigenvalues of the matrix $A(k) = J-k^2\\operatorname{diag}(D_u,D_v)$. The characteristic polynomial is $\\lambda^2-\\tau_k\\lambda+\\Delta_k=0$, with roots $\\lambda_{\\pm}(k) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tau_k \\pm \\sqrt{\\tau_k^2 - 4\\Delta_k})$.\nInstability at mode $k$ means $\\Re(\\lambda_+(k)) > 0$.\n\nThe robust stability at $k=0$ implies $\\tau = a+d < 0$. Since $\\tau_k = \\tau - (D_u+D_v)k^2$ and $D_u, D_v > 0$, it follows that $\\tau_k < 0$ for all $k \\geq 0$.\nGiven $\\tau_k < 0$, for $\\Re(\\lambda_+(k)) > 0$ it is required that $\\tau_k^2 - 4\\Delta_k$ becomes positive and $\\tau_k + \\sqrt{\\tau_k^2 - 4\\Delta_k} > 0$. This second inequality is equivalent to $\\sqrt{\\tau_k^2 - 4\\Delta_k} > -\\tau_k = |\\tau_k|$, which simplifies to $\\tau_k^2 - 4\\Delta_k > \\tau_k^2$, or $-4\\Delta_k > 0$, which is $\\Delta_k < 0$.\n\nSo, the sole condition for instability to emerge at a wavenumber $k>0$ is $\\Delta_k < 0$. Let's analyze this condition. We define $x=k^2$ for $x>0$:\n$$ \\Delta_k \\equiv \\Delta(x) = (D_uD_v)x^2 - (aD_v+dD_u)x + (ad-bc) < 0 $$\nLet $\\alpha = aD_v+dD_u$ and $\\beta = D_uD_v$. The inequality is $\\beta x^2 - \\alpha x + \\Delta < 0$.\nSince $\\beta > 0$, this quadratic describes an upward-opening parabola. For it to become negative for some $x$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The parabola's minimum must be below the x-axis, which means the quadratic equation $\\beta x^2 - \\alpha x + \\Delta = 0$ must have real roots. The discriminant must be positive: $(-\\alpha)^2 - 4\\beta\\Delta > 0$, or $\\alpha^2 - 4\\beta\\Delta > 0$.\n2.  The region where the parabola is negative must overlap with $x > 0$. The roots of the quadratic are $x_{1,2} = \\frac{\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 - 4\\beta\\Delta}}{2\\beta}$. For at least one root to be positive, we need $\\alpha > 0$. (If $\\alpha \\le 0$, since $\\Delta>0$, both roots would be non-positive, yielding no instability for $k>0$).\n\nTherefore, for any given parameter set, a Turing instability band exists if and only if $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\alpha^2 - 4\\beta\\Delta > 0$. The band for $k^2=x$ is $(x_1, x_2)$, and for $k$ it is $(\\sqrt{x_1}, \\sqrt{x_2})$.\n\n**3. Computing the Robust Turing Region $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{robust}}$**\n\nThe problem defines $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{robust}}$ as the intersection of all individual instability bands over the entire uncertainty set $\\mathcal{U}$, approximated by examining the $2^6 = 64$ corner points of the six-dimensional parameter box.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize a robust interval $[k_{\\min, \\text{robust}}, k_{\\max, \\text{robust}}] = [0, \\infty]$.\n2.  For each of the $64$ corner points of the parameter box $(a,b,c,d,D_u,D_v)$:\n    a. Calculate $\\Delta$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ for the corner.\n    b. Check if the conditions for an instability band are met: $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\alpha^2-4\\beta\\Delta > 0$.\n    c. If these conditions fail for even one corner, the intersection is empty. The procedure for this test case terminates, and $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{robust}} = \\emptyset$.\n    d. If the conditions are met, calculate the band endpoints for $k$: $k_{1} = \\sqrt{(\\alpha - \\sqrt{\\alpha^2-4\\beta\\Delta})/(2\\beta)}$ and $k_{2} = \\sqrt{(\\alpha + \\sqrt{\\alpha^2-4\\beta\\Delta})/(2\\beta)}$.\n    e. Update the robust interval by taking the intersection:\n        $k_{\\min, \\text{robust}} \\leftarrow \\max(k_{\\min, \\text{robust}}, k_1)$\n        $k_{\\max, \\text{robust}} \\leftarrow \\min(k_{\\max, \\text{robust}}, k_2)$\n3.  After checking all corners, if the process was not aborted, the final robust Turing region is $(k_{\\min, \\text{robust}}, k_{\\max, \\text{robust}})$. If $k_{\\min, \\text{robust}} \\geq k_{\\max, \\text{robust}}$, the intersection is empty.\n\n**4. Sensitivity Discussion**\n\nThe bounds of the instability band, $k_1$ and $k_2$, depend on the parameters $(a,b,c,d,D_u,D_v)$ through $\\Delta$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$.\n-   The Jacobian parameters $(a,b,c,d)$ influence $\\Delta$ and $\\alpha$.\n-   The diffusion coefficients $(D_u, D_v)$ influence $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe width of the robust band $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{robust}}$ is $k_{\\max, \\text{robust}} - k_{\\min, \\text{robust}}$. The final value $k_{\\max, \\text{robust}}$ is the minimum of all upper bounds $k_2$ across the corners, while $k_{\\min, \\text{robust}}$ is the maximum of all lower bounds $k_1$.\n\nTightening the bounds on the entries of $J$ reduces the uncertainty in $\\Delta = ad-bc$ and $\\alpha = aD_v+dD_u$. This reduces the variability of the band endpoints $(k_1, k_2)$ across the parameter space. Consequently, the minimum of the $k_2$ values is likely to increase, and the maximum of the $k_1$ values is likely to decrease. The overall effect would be a widening of the robust intersection $(k_{\\min, \\text{robust}}, k_{\\max, \\text{robust}})$. Conversely, loosening the bounds on $J$ introduces more variability, which shrinks the robust region, making the prediction of a Turing pattern less certain. If the uncertainty is too large, the intersection may become empty, implying that pattern formation cannot be guaranteed. This highlights the critical importance of precise parameter estimation in synthetic biology design.\n\nThe following program implements this validation and calculation procedure for the given test cases.",
