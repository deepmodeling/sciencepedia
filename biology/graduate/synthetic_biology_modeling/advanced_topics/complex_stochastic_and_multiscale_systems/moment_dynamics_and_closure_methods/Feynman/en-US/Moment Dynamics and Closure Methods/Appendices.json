It is a valid, well-posed problem in theoretical biophysics.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe time evolution of the expectation of any function $f(X)$ of the state variable $X$ is given by the general formula derived from the CME:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[f(X)]}{dt} = \\sum_{j} \\mathbb{E}[(f(X+S_j) - f(X)) a_j(X)]\n$$\nwhere $j$ indexes the reactions, $S_j$ is the stoichiometric vector (change in copy number) for reaction $j$, and $a_j(X)$ is its propensity. For this system, we have two reactions:\n1. Birth: $S_b = +1$, $a_b(X) = k_b$\n2. Death: $S_d = -1$, $a_d(X) = k_d X$\n\nThe general equation for this specific system is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[f(X)]}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[(f(X+1) - f(X)) k_b] + \\mathbb{E}[(f(X-1) - f(X)) k_d X]\n$$\n\n**1. Equation for the First Moment (Mean)**\nLet $\\mu(t) = \\mathbb{E}[X(t)]$. We set $f(x)=x$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = \\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X]}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[((X+1) - X)k_b] + \\mathbb{E}[((X-1) - X)k_d X]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[1 \\cdot k_b] + \\mathbb{E}[(-1) \\cdot k_d X]\n$$\nSince $k_b$ and $k_d$ are constants, we can take them out of the expectation.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = k_b - k_d \\mathbb{E}[X]\n$$\nThe resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the mean is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dt} = k_b - k_d \\mu\n$$\nThis is a closed-form ODE for the first moment, as it does not depend on any higher moments.\n\n**2. Equation for the Second Moment**\nLet $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$. We set $f(x)=x^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[((X+1)^2 - X^2)k_b] + \\mathbb{E}[((X-1)^2 - X^2)k_d X]\n$$\nExpand the terms inside the expectations:\n$$\n(X+1)^2 - X^2 = X^2 + 2X + 1 - X^2 = 2X+1\n$$\n$$\n(X-1)^2 - X^2 = X^2 - 2X + 1 - X^2 = -2X+1\n$$\nSubstitute these back into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = \\mathbb{E}[(2X+1)k_b] + \\mathbb{E}[(-2X+1)k_d X]\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = k_b \\mathbb{E}[2X+1] + k_d \\mathbb{E}[-2X^2+X]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = 2k_b \\mathbb{E}[X] + k_b - 2k_d \\mathbb{E}[X^2] + k_d \\mathbb{E}[X]\n$$\nGrouping terms by moments:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]}{dt} = (2k_b + k_d)\\mu - 2k_d\\mathbb{E}[X^2] + k_b\n$$\nThis is a closed-form linear ODE for the second moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]$ that depends only on the first moment $\\mu$ and itself.\n\n**3. Argument for Natural Closure**\nThe system of moment equations is naturally closed because the propensities $a_b(x)=k_b$ and $a_d(x)=k_d x$ are affine functions of the state variable $x$ (i.e., polynomials of degree at most $1$). For the $n$-th moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^n]$, its time derivative is a sum of terms of the form $\\mathbb{E}[( (X+S_j)^n - X^n) a_j(X) ]$. Using the binomial expansion, the term $(X+S_j)^n - X^n$ is a polynomial in $X$ of degree $n-1$. When this is multiplied by a propensity $a_j(X)$, which is a polynomial of degree at most $1$, the resulting product is a polynomial in $X$ of degree at most $(n-1)+1=n$. Therefore, the expectation of this product, $\\mathbb{E}[( (X+S_j)^n - X^n) a_j(X) ]$, is a linear combination of moments up to order $n$ (i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[X^k]$ for $k \\le n$). Consequently, the equation for the $n$-th moment depends only on moments of order $n$ or lower, leading to a closed, hierarchical system of ODEs that can be solved sequentially without any approximation.\n\n**4. Stationary Mean and Fano Factor**\nAt stationarity, the system reaches a steady state where all time derivatives are zero.\nFor the stationary mean $\\mu_{\\infty}$, we set $d\\mu/dt = 0$:\n$$\n0 = k_b - k_d \\mu_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\infty} = \\frac{k_b}{k_d}\n$$\nFor the stationary second moment $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty}$, we set $d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]/dt = 0$ and substitute $\\mu = \\mu_{\\infty}$:\n$$\n0 = (2k_b + k_d)\\mu_{\\infty} - 2k_d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} + k_b\n$$\n$$\n2k_d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} = (2k_b + k_d)\\mu_{\\infty} + k_b\n$$\nSubstitute $\\mu_{\\infty} = k_b/k_d$:\n$$\n2k_d\\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} = (2k_b + k_d)\\frac{k_b}{k_d} + k_b = \\frac{2k_b^2}{k_d} + k_b + k_b = \\frac{2k_b^2}{k_d} + 2k_b\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2k_d}\\left(\\frac{2k_b^2}{k_d} + 2k_b\\right) = \\frac{k_b^2}{k_d^2} + \\frac{k_b}{k_d}\n$$\nIn terms of the stationary mean, this is $\\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} = \\mu_{\\infty}^2 + \\mu_{\\infty}$.\n\nThe stationary variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X)_{\\infty}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X)_{\\infty} = \\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} - (\\mathbb{E}[X]_{\\infty})^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X^2]_{\\infty} - \\mu_{\\infty}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(X)_{\\infty} = (\\mu_{\\infty}^2 + \\mu_{\\infty}) - \\mu_{\\infty}^2 = \\mu_{\\infty}\n$$\nThe stationary variance is equal to the stationary mean.\n\nThe stationary Fano factor, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty}$, is the ratio of the stationary variance to the stationary mean:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)_{\\infty}}{\\mathbb{E}[X]_{\\infty}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\infty}}{\\mu_{\\infty}}\n$$\nGiven that $k_b > 0$ and $k_d > 0$, the mean $\\mu_{\\infty} = k_b/k_d$ is strictly positive, so the division is well-defined.\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty} = 1\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the fact that the stationary distribution of this linear birth-death process is a Poisson distribution, for which the variance is equal to the mean.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\mu_{\\infty} & \\mathcal{F}_{\\infty}\\end{pmatrix}$, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_b}{k_d} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

We now substitute these into the expression for the moment $\\mathbb{E}[X Y^{2}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X Y^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\mu_{X} + \\tilde{X})(\\mu_{Y} + \\tilde{Y})^{2}]\n$$\nExpanding the squared term first:\n$$\n(\\mu_{Y} + \\tilde{Y})^{2} = \\mu_{Y}^{2} + 2\\mu_{Y}\\tilde{Y} + \\tilde{Y}^{2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back and expand the full expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X Y^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\mu_{X} + \\tilde{X})(\\mu_{Y}^{2} + 2\\mu_{Y}\\tilde{Y} + \\tilde{Y}^{2})]\n$$\n$$\n= \\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2} + 2\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}\\tilde{Y} + \\mu_{X}\\tilde{Y}^{2} + \\tilde{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2} + 2\\mu_{Y}\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y} + \\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}^{2}]\n$$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, we can take the expectation of each term individually:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X Y^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2}] + 2\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{Y}] + \\mu_{X}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{Y}^{2}] + \\mu_{Y}^{2}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}] + 2\\mu_{Y}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}] + \\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}^{2}]\n$$\nWe now evaluate each expectation term by term using the properties of the central variables:\n$1.$ $\\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2}] = \\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2}$, since means are constants.\n$2.$ $2\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{Y}] = 2\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}(0) = 0$.\n$3.$ $\\mu_{X}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{Y}^{2}] = \\mu_{X}\\Sigma_{YY}$.\n$4.$ $\\mu_{Y}^{2}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}] = \\mu_{Y}^{2}(0) = 0$.\n$5.$ $2\\mu_{Y}\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}] = 2\\mu_{Y}\\Sigma_{XY}$.\n$6.$ The final term is the third-order central moment $\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}^{2}]$.\n\nThis is where the Gaussian closure assumption is critical. A fundamental property of any multivariate normal distribution is that all its odd-ordered central moments are zero. This arises from the symmetry of the Gaussian probability density function about the mean. The moment $\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}^{2}]$ is the expectation of a product of three (an odd number) zero-mean Gaussian variables ($\\tilde{X}$, $\\tilde{Y}$, $\\tilde{Y}$). Therefore, under the Gaussian assumption:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\tilde{X}\\tilde{Y}^{2}] = 0\n$$\nThis result is formalized by Isserlis' theorem (also known as Wick's theorem for Gaussian variables), which provides a formula for the expectation of a product of zero-mean Gaussian variables. For an odd number of variables, the theorem yields zero. Thus, the contribution from this higher-order central moment vanishes entirely.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expanded equation, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X Y^{2}] = \\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2} + 0 + \\mu_{X}\\Sigma_{YY} + 0 + 2\\mu_{Y}\\Sigma_{XY} + 0\n$$\nCombining the non-zero terms gives the final expression for the third-order moment in terms of first and second-order moments:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X Y^{2}] = \\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2} + \\mu_{X}\\Sigma_{YY} + 2\\mu_{Y}\\Sigma_{XY}\n$$\nEach term in this result originates from the expansion and is justified by the properties of the mean and covariance. The term $\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}^{2}$ arises from the product of the means. The term $\\mu_{X}\\Sigma_{YY}$ originates from the product of $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ and the variance of $Y$. The term $2\\mu_{Y}\\Sigma_{XY}$ originates from the interaction between $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$ and the covariance of $X$ and $Y$. The Gaussian assumption simplifies the problem by causing the third-order central moment $\\mathbb{E}[(X-\\mu_X)(Y-\\mu_Y)^2]$ to be exactly zero, thereby closing the system at second order.",
