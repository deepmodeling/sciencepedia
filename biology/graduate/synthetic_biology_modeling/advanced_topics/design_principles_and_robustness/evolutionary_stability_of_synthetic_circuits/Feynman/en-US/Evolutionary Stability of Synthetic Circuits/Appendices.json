            "introduction": "The first step in analyzing the evolutionary stability of a synthetic circuit is to quantify its cost to the host organism. This cost, or metabolic burden, creates a selective disadvantage that can lead to the circuit's loss from the population. This exercise provides a hands-on approach to connect a biophysical resource allocation model to the fundamental parameter of population genetics: the selection coefficient, $s$. By calculating $s$ from measurable properties like protein production rates, you will gain a crucial skill for building predictive models of circuit evolution .",

            "problem": "An engineered bacterial strain hosts a synthetic gene circuit that draws translational and transcriptional capacity away from endogenous processes. In a resource allocation model, the instantaneous exponential growth rate is reduced from its baseline value by the proteome fraction allocated to the circuit. Specifically, let the cell number be $N(t)$, and assume exponential growth $N(t)=N(0)\\exp(g t)$ where $g$ is the Malthusian parameter (per-capita growth rate). In the absence of the circuit, the baseline growth rate is $g_{0}$. When the circuit is present, the growth rate is reduced according to $g=g_{0}-\\alpha P$, where $P$ is the dimensionless fraction of the proteome devoted to circuit protein production and $\\alpha$ is the burden coefficient, with units $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nSuppose the circuit is controlled by an inducer at concentration $I$ and its proteome allocation follows a rectangular hyperbola, $P(I)=P_{\\max}\\frac{I}{K+I}$, where $P_{\\max}$ is the maximal proteome fraction the circuit can occupy and $K$ is the inducer concentration at which the circuit occupies half of $P_{\\max}$. You may assume $P_{\\max}$ is small enough that the linear burden model above is valid.\n\nThe selection coefficient against the circuit is defined from first principles of exponential growth as the fractional reduction in Malthusian fitness of the circuit-bearing strain relative to the wild-type baseline, namely $s=\\frac{g_{\\text{wild}}-g_{\\text{circuit}}}{g_{\\text{wild}}}$, where $g_{\\text{wild}}$ is the growth rate without the circuit and $g_{\\text{circuit}}$ is the growth rate with the circuit.\n\nGiven the following parameter values: $g_{0}=1.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $\\alpha=2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $P_{\\max}=0.25$ (dimensionless), $K=20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, and $I=50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$, derive an expression for the selection coefficient $s$ against the circuit from the above definitions and model, and then compute its numerical value at the specified inducer level. Express the final selection coefficient as a pure decimal (unitless). Round your answer to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the selection coefficient, $s$, against a synthetic gene circuit in an engineered bacterial strain. The solution requires integrating the definitions and models provided for cell growth, metabolic burden, and gene expression regulation.\n\nFirst, we begin with the definition of the selection coefficient, which is given as the fractional reduction in the Malthusian fitness of the circuit-bearing strain relative to the wild-type strain:\n$$s = \\frac{g_{\\text{wild}}-g_{\\text{circuit}}}{g_{\\text{wild}}}$$\nThe problem states that the wild-type strain, which lacks the circuit, has a baseline growth rate of $g_0$. Therefore, we can identify $g_{\\text{wild}} = g_{0}$.\nThe circuit-bearing strain's growth rate, $g_{\\text{circuit}}$, is reduced from the baseline due to the metabolic burden of producing circuit proteins. The model for this reduction is given as $g=g_{0}-\\alpha P$, where $P$ is the proteome fraction allocated to the circuit. Thus, we have $g_{\\text{circuit}} = g_{0} - \\alpha P$.\n\nSubstituting these identifications into the definition of $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{g_{0} - (g_{0} - \\alpha P)}{g_{0}}$$\nSimplifying the numerator, we find:\n$$s = \\frac{g_{0} - g_{0} + \\alpha P}{g_{0}} = \\frac{\\alpha P}{g_{0}}$$\nThis equation provides an expression for the selection coefficient in terms of the burden coefficient $\\alpha$, the proteome fraction $P$, and the baseline growth rate $g_0$. It represents the fitness cost of the circuit ($\\alpha P$) normalized by the baseline fitness of the cell ($g_0$).\n\nNext, we need to determine the value of the proteome fraction $P$. The problem states that $P$ is a function of the inducer concentration $I$, following a rectangular hyperbola model:\n$$P(I) = P_{\\max}\\frac{I}{K+I}$$\nHere, $P_{\\max}$ is the maximal proteome fraction and $K$ is the inducer concentration for half-maximal expression.\n\nBy substituting this expression for $P(I)$ into our derived formula for $s$, we obtain the complete analytical expression for the selection coefficient as a function of inducer concentration:\n$$s(I) = \\frac{\\alpha}{g_{0}} \\left( P_{\\max} \\frac{I}{K+I} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $s$ using the provided parameter values:\n-   Baseline growth rate: $g_{0}=1.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n-   Burden coefficient: $\\alpha=2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n-   Maximal proteome fraction: $P_{\\max}=0.25$\n-   Half-maximal induction constant: $K=20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n-   Inducer concentration: $I=50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the proteome fraction $P$ at the specified inducer concentration $I=50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$:\n$$P(I=50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}) = 0.25 \\times \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M} + 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{50}{70}$$\n$$P = 0.25 \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{5}{28}$$\nThe proteome fraction $P$ is a dimensionless quantity, which is consistent with its definition.\n\nNow, we substitute this value of $P$ into the expression for $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{\\alpha P}{g_{0}} = \\frac{2.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{1.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\times \\frac{5}{28}$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless selection coefficient as expected.\n$$s = \\frac{2.0}{1.2} \\times \\frac{5}{28} = \\frac{20}{12} \\times \\frac{5}{28} = \\frac{5}{3} \\times \\frac{5}{28} = \\frac{25}{84}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of this fraction and round it to $4$ significant figures as requested:\n$$s = \\frac{25}{84} \\approx 0.29761904...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$s \\approx 0.2976$$\nThis is the final numerical value for the selection coefficient against the synthetic circuit under the specified conditions.",

            "problem": "A synthetic gene circuit imposes a metabolic burden on host cells that carry it, reducing their reproductive success relative to cells that have lost the circuit through mutation. Consider a well-mixed, constant-size asexual population comprised of two types: the functional circuit carriers and the cheater cells lacking the circuit. Let $x(t)$ denote the fraction of functional circuit carriers at time $t$. Functional cells mutate to cheaters at a forward rate $\\mu$ per unit time, cheaters revert to functional at a back rate $\\nu$ per unit time, and the functional type has a selection disadvantage $s$ (with $0 < s \\ll 1$) relative to cheaters, modeled as a reduction in its Malthusian fitness.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium fraction of functional circuit carriers, $x^{*}$, in a population genetics model incorporating selection and mutation. We will first derive the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the fraction of functional cells, $x(t)$, then linearize it under the weak selection assumption, and finally solve for the equilibrium point.\n\nLet $x$ be the fraction of functional circuit carriers and $1-x$ be the fraction of cheater cells. The parameters are the forward mutation rate $\\mu$ (functional to cheater), the back mutation rate $\\nu$ (cheater to functional), and the selection disadvantage $s$ of the functional type.\n\nFirst, we define the Malthusian fitness (growth rate) for each type. Let the fitness of the cheater type be the baseline, $r_C$. The functional type has a selective disadvantage $s$, so its fitness is $r_F = r_C - s$.\n\nThe average Malthusian fitness of the population, $\\bar{r}$, is the weighted average of the individual fitnesses:\n$$ \\bar{r} = x r_F + (1-x) r_C = x(r_C - s) + (1-x)r_C = x r_C - s x + r_C - x r_C = r_C - s x $$\n\nThe change in the fraction $x$ due to selection is described by the continuous-time replicator equation:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{selection}} = x(r_F - \\bar{r}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_F$ and $\\bar{r}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{selection}} = x((r_C - s) - (r_C - s x)) = x(-s + s x) = -s x(1-x) $$\n\nNext, we account for the change in $x$ due to mutation. Functional cells are lost at a rate $\\mu x$, and are gained from the cheater population at a rate $\\nu(1-x)$. The net change due to mutation is:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{mutation}} = \\nu(1-x) - \\mu x $$\n\nThe total rate of change of $x$, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, is the sum of the changes from selection and mutation:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{selection}} + \\frac{dx}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{mutation}} $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = -s x(1-x) + \\nu(1-x) - \\mu x $$\nExpanding the terms, we get the full nonlinear ODE:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = -s x + s x^2 + \\nu - \\nu x - \\mu x $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = s x^2 - (s + \\mu + \\nu)x + \\nu $$\n\nThe problem asks for a linearized form valid to first order in $s$, specifically by \"neglecting products of small quantities such as $s x^2$\". Since selection is weak ($s \\ll 1$), the term $s x^2$ is considered a higher-order small term. Neglecting this term simplifies the dynamics. The resulting linearized ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} \\approx -(s + \\mu + \\nu)x + \\nu $$\nThis is a linear first-order ODE.\n\nTo find the equilibrium fraction, $x^*$, we set the time derivative to zero, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = -(s + \\mu + \\nu)x^* + \\nu $$\nNow, we solve for $x^*$:\n$$ (s + \\mu + \\nu)x^* = \\nu $$\n$$ x^* = \\frac{\\nu}{s + \\mu + \\nu} $$\nThis expression represents the equilibrium fraction of functional circuit carriers under mutation-selection balance in the weak selection limit. It correctly shows that as the selective cost $s$ increases, the equilibrium fraction $x^*$ of the costly circuit decreases. In the absence of selection ($s=0$), the equilibrium reduces to the neutral mutation balance result, $x^* = \\frac{\\nu}{\\mu + \\nu}$.",
