I will proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\nThe quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) is applicable when a system exhibits a separation of timescales. In this problem, the binding and unbinding of the transcription factor $X$ to the promoter $P$ to form the complex $C$ is considered the \"fast\" process, while the catalytic synthesis of the product $Y$ is the \"slow\" process. Our goal is to derive a dimensionless parameter, $\\epsilon$, that quantifies the ratio of the characteristic rate of the slow process to that of the fast process.\n\nFirst, we analyze the dynamics of the complex concentration, $[C]$, which we denote as $C$ for simplicity. The governing differential equation for $C$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X\\,P - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,C $$\nWe are given that the total promoter concentration is constant, $P_{\\mathrm{T}} = P + C$, which implies $P = P_{\\mathrm{T}} - C$. We are also given that the transcription factor concentration is buffered and can be treated as a constant, $X = X_0$. Substituting these into the differential equation for $C$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0}\\,(P_{\\mathrm{T}} - C) - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,C $$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0}\\,P_{\\mathrm{T}} - k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0}\\,C - k_{\\mathrm{off}}\\,C $$\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0}\\,P_{\\mathrm{T}} - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{off}})\\,C $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $C$ of the form $\\frac{dC}{dt} = A - B\\,C$. The solution to such an equation is an exponential relaxation to a steady state. The rate of this relaxation is given by the coefficient $B$. This rate characterizes the \"fast\" dynamics of binding and unbinding. We therefore define the characteristic rate of the fast binding/unbinding process, $k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$, as:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{fast}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{off}} $$\nThe inverse of this rate, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$, is the characteristic time for the concentration $C$ to approach its quasi-steady-state value.\n\nNext, we identify the characteristic rate of the \"slow\" catalytic synthesis of $Y$. The dynamics of $Y$ are given by:\n$$ \\frac{dY}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\,C $$\nThis equation describes the production of $Y$ catalyzed by the complex $C$. The rate constant for this process is $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, which represents the turnover number of the complex—the number of $Y$ molecules produced per unit time per molecule of $C$. Therefore, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the intrinsic, first-order rate constant that defines the timescale of the slow synthesis process. We define the characteristic rate of the slow process, $k_{\\mathrm{slow}}$, as:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{slow}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} $$\n\nThe QSSA is valid when the fast process is much faster than the slow process, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{fast}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{slow}}$. The dimensionless small parameter $\\epsilon$ that quantifies this timescale separation is the ratio of the slow rate to the fast rate:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{slow}}}{k_{\\mathrm{fast}}} $$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for the characteristic rates, we obtain the symbolic expression for $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{off}}} $$\nThe condition for the validity of the QSSA is $\\epsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\epsilon$ using the provided parameter set:\n- $k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $X_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0} = (3.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 6.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is $k_{\\mathrm{fast}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{fast}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,X_{0} + k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 0.02\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.62\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe numerator is $k_{\\mathrm{slow}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFinally, we compute $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.62\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.0015}{0.62} \\approx 0.0024193548... $$\nThe problem requires the answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 0.002419 $$\nThe small value of $\\epsilon$ indicates a significant separation of timescales, justifying the use of the QSSA for this set of parameters.",

The Jacobian matrix is defined as:\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial S}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial C} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S} = -k_{\\text{deg}} - k_{\\text{a}}E_{\\text{T}} + k_{\\text{a}}C $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C} = k_{\\text{a}}S + k_{\\text{diss}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial S} = k_{\\text{a}}E_{\\text{T}} - k_{\\text{a}}C $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial C} = -k_{\\text{a}}S - (k_{\\text{diss}} + k_{\\text{cat}}) $$\nNow, we evaluate these derivatives at the initial point $(S, C) = (S_0, 0)$:\n$$ J_{11} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S}\\Big|_{(S_0, 0)} = -k_{\\text{deg}} - k_{\\text{a}}E_{\\text{T}} $$\n$$ J_{12} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial C}\\Big|_{(S_0, 0)} = k_{\\text{a}}S_0 + k_{\\text{diss}} $$\n$$ J_{21} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial S}\\Big|_{(S_0, 0)} = k_{\\text{a}}E_{\\text{T}} $$\n$$ J_{22} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial C}\\Big|_{(S_0, 0)} = -k_{\\text{a}}S_0 - (k_{\\text{diss}} + k_{\\text{cat}}) $$\nLet us substitute the given parameter values:\n$k_{\\text{a}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}~\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{diss}} = 50~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{cat}} = 200~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{deg}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{s}^{-1}$, $E_{\\text{T}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{M}$, and $S_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{M}$.\n\n$J_{11} = -(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) - (2.0 \\times 10^{6})(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = -0.001 - 0.04 = -0.041~\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$J_{12} = (2.0 \\times 10^{6})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) + 50 = 2.0 + 50 = 52~\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$J_{21} = (2.0 \\times 10^{6})(2.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = 0.04~\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$J_{22} = -(2.0 \\times 10^{6})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) - (50 + 200) = -2.0 - 250 = -252~\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix at the initial condition, $J_0$, is:\n$$ J_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.041  52 \\\\ 0.04  -252 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic time scales are determined by the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J_0$. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J_0 - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -0.041 - \\lambda  52 \\\\ 0.04  -252 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-0.041 - \\lambda)(-252 - \\lambda) - (52)(0.04) = 0 $$\nExpanding this gives the quadratic equation:\n$$ \\lambda^2 + (252 + 0.041)\\lambda + (0.041)(252) - 2.08 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + 252.041\\lambda + 10.332 - 2.08 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + 252.041\\lambda + 8.252 = 0 $$\nWe solve for $\\lambda$ using the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-252.041 \\pm \\sqrt{(252.041)^2 - 4(1)(8.252)}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-252.041 \\pm \\sqrt{63524.70881 - 33.008}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-252.041 \\pm \\sqrt{63491.70081}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-252.041 \\pm 251.9755956}{2} $$\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{-252.041 + 251.9755956}{2} = \\frac{-0.0654044}{2} \\approx -0.0327022~\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = \\frac{-252.041 - 251.9755956}{2} = \\frac{-504.0165956}{2} \\approx -252.0083~\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe magnitudes of the eigenvalues define the characteristic rates of the system.
