            "problem": "A single bacterial cell allocates its RNA polymerase (RNAP) across many competing promoter sites from both the host genome and an engineered synthetic circuit. Assume the following scientifically realistic scenario under steady state and thermodynamic equilibrium: each promoter binds at most one RNAP, binding is independent and noncooperative, and all promoters share the same RNAP dissociation constant $K_d$. Let $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ denote the total RNAP molecules per cell and $P_f$ the free (unbound) RNAP molecules. Each promoter site is either free or bound, and the law of mass action holds.\n\nThe synthetic circuit consists of two plasmids: plasmid $A$ with copy number $c_A = 30$, each bearing $n_A = 3$ identical promoters, and plasmid $B$ with copy number $c_B = 20$, each bearing $n_B = 5$ identical promoters. The host genome provides $H = 1810$ active promoters competing for RNAP in the same manner. The total RNAP per cell is $P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 3000$ molecules, and the dissociation constant is $K_d = 50$ molecules.\n\nStarting from first principles of chemical equilibrium and mass conservation in this multi-site binding context, derive the necessary equations to determine the allocation of RNAP across the promoter pools.

No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) allocation between a synthetic circuit and the host genome under thermodynamic equilibrium. The solution will be derived from the first principles of statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics, specifically the law of mass action for molecular binding and the principle of mass conservation.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The binding of a free RNAP molecule, denoted as $P_f$, to any available promoter site, $S$, forms a bound complex, $C$. This reversible reaction is represented as:\n$$S + P_f \\rightleftharpoons C$$\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action. While $K_d$ is formally defined in terms of concentrations, we can express it using the number of molecules per cell since all species exist within the same cellular volume, causing the volume term to cancel out.\n$$K_d = \\frac{(\\text{number of free promoters}) \\cdot (\\text{number of free RNAP})}{(\\text{number of bound promoters})} = \\frac{[S] [P_f]}{[C]}$$\nLet $S_{\\mathrm{pool}}$ be the total number of promoters in a given pool. Each promoter is either free or bound, so $S_{\\mathrm{pool}} = [S] + [C]$. The number of bound promoters (which equals the number of RNAP molecules bound to that pool) is $[C]$. We can express $[C]$ in terms of the free RNAP, $P_f$.\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we have $[S] = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[P_f]}$. Substituting this into the conservation equation for promoters:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pool}} = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[P_f]} + [C] = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[P_f]} + 1 \\right) = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [P_f]}{[P_f]} \\right)$$\nSolving for $[C]$, the number of bound RNAP molecules to this pool, we get:\n$$[C] = S_{\\mathrm{pool}} \\frac{[P_f]}{K_d + [P_f]}$$\nFor clarity, we will use $P_f$ instead of $[P_f]$ to denote the number of free RNAP molecules. The fraction of occupied promoters, $\\theta$, is thus given by $\\theta = \\frac{P_f}{K_d + P_f}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of promoters in each competing pool.\nThe synthetic circuit consists of two plasmids.\nNumber of promoters on plasmid A: $S_A = c_A \\cdot n_A = 30 \\times 3 = 90$.\nNumber of promoters on plasmid B: $S_B = c_B \\cdot n_B = 20 \\times 5 = 100$.\nTotal number of synthetic promoters: $S_{\\mathrm{syn}} = S_A + S_B = 90 + 100 = 190$.\n\nThe number of competing promoters from the host genome is given as $S_{\\mathrm{host}} = H = 1810$.\n\nThe total number of promoter sites competing for RNAP is the sum of all pools:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{total}} = S_{\\mathrm{syn}} + S_{\\mathrm{host}} = 190 + 1810 = 2000$$\n\nThe central principle for solving the system is the conservation of total RNAP. The total number of RNAP molecules, $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of free RNAP, $P_f$, and total bound RNAP, $P_b$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = P_f + P_b$$\nThe total bound RNAP, $P_b$, is the sum of RNAP bound to all promoter sites.

Translation initiation is the limiting step for protein production and the reporter is intended to quantify the shared load on the finite pool of ribosomes.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to derive an expression for the competitive effect of a co-expressed protein on a reporter and then to calculate a specific numerical value for this effect. The validation process confirms that the problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded within the context of simplified biochemical modeling, and contains all necessary information. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in how the finite pool of total ribosomes, $R_{\\text{tot}}$, is partitioned between its free form, $R_f$, and forms bound to messenger RNA (mRNA) of the reporter ($R$) and competitor ($C$). The protein production rate for any species $i$, $\\pi_i$, is directly proportional to the number of ribosomes bound to its mRNA, $b_i$.\n\nLet us first establish the governing equations based on the problem statement.\nThe number of ribosomes bound to mRNA species $i$ is given by the law of mass action at equilibrium. The binding reaction is $R_f + \\text{mRNA}_i \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Complex}_i$. The number of complexes is $b_i$. The dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined, in terms of molecular counts, as $K_d = \\frac{R_f \\cdot m_{i, \\text{free}}}{b_i}$. Since the total number of mRNA molecules $m_i$ is the sum of free and bound, $m_i = m_{i, \\text{free}} + b_i$, we can write $b_i = \\frac{m_i R_f}{K_d + R_f}$.\nThe problem specifies the weak-binding regime, where the free ribosome count is much smaller than the dissociation constant: $R_f \\ll K_d$. Under this approximation, the denominator $K_d + R_f \\approx K_d$, which simplifies the binding equation to:\n$$b_i = \\frac{m_i R_f}{K_d}$$\nThis equation is consistent with the problem's statement that $b_i$ scales linearly with $R_f$ and $m_i$.\n\nThe total number of ribosomes in the cell is conserved:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} = R_f + \\sum_{i} b_i$$\n\nThe protein production rate from species $i$ is given as:\n$$\\pi_i = k_{\\text{elong}} b_i$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{elong}}$ is the constant elongation rate.\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio $\\rho = \\frac{\\pi_R(\\text{with C})}{\\pi_R(\\text{without C})}$.

Let's verify the consistency:\n$m_{\\mathrm{operon}} = \\frac{\\phi_1^*}{\\kappa_1} = \\frac{2 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.02 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 100$\n$m_{\\mathrm{operon}} = \\frac{\\phi_2^*}{\\kappa_2} = \\frac{1.5 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.015 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 100$\n$m_{\\mathrm{operon}} = \\frac{\\phi_3^*}{\\kappa_3} = \\frac{1 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.01 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 100$\nThe conditions are consistent, requiring a steady-state mRNA copy number of $m_{\\mathrm{operon}} = 100$.\n\nThe transcription initiation rate is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{operon}} = m_{\\mathrm{operon}} \\delta = 100 \\times 0.003 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe transcribed length of the operon is the sum of the lengths of the leader, coding sequences, intergenic spacers, and terminator:\n$L_{tx,\\mathrm{operon}} = L_{leader} + L_{cds,1} + L_{spacer,1} + L_{cds,2} + L_{spacer,2} + L_{cds,3} + L_{term}$\n$L_{tx,\\mathrm{operon}} = 100 + 900 + 50 + 600 + 50 + 300 + 150 = 2150 \\,\\mathrm{nt}$.\nThe RNAP dwell time is $\\tau_{p,\\mathrm{operon}} = \\frac{L_{tx,\\mathrm{operon}}}{v_p} = \\frac{2150 \\,\\mathrm{nt}}{60 \\,\\mathrm{nt/s}} = \\frac{215}{6} \\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe number of engaged RNAPs is:\n$N_{p,\\mathrm{operon}} = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{operon}} \\tau_{p,\\mathrm{operon}} = (0.3 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (\\frac{215}{6} \\,\\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{215}{6} = \\frac{215}{20} = 10.75$.\n\n**Separate Promoters Architecture**\nIn this case, there are three distinct monocistronic mRNAs. For each transcript $i$, we calculate the required copy number $m_i$ to achieve the target production rate $\\phi_i^*$:\n$m_1 = \\frac{\\phi_1^*}{\\kappa_1} = 100$\n$m_2 = \\frac{\\phi_2^*}{\\kappa_2} = 100$\n$m_3 = \\frac{\\phi_3^*}{\\kappa_3} = 100$\nThe corresponding transcription initiation rates are:\n$\\lambda_1 = m_1 \\delta = 100 \\times 0.003 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_2 = m_2 \\delta = 100 \\times 0.003 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_3 = m_3 \\delta = 100 \\times 0.003 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nThe transcribed lengths for each monocistronic mRNA are:\n$L_{tx,1} = L_{leader} + L_{cds,1} + L_{term} = 100 + 900 + 150 = 1150 \\,\\mathrm{nt}$\n$L_{tx,2} = L_{leader} + L_{cds,2} + L_{term} = 100 + 600 + 150 = 850 \\,\\mathrm{nt}$\n$L_{tx,3} = L_{leader} + L_{cds,3} + L_{term} = 100 + 300 + 150 = 550 \\,\\mathrm{nt}$\nThe RNAP dwell times are:\n$\\tau_{p,1} = \\frac{1150}{60} = \\frac{115}{6} \\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{p,2} = \\frac{850}{60} = \\frac{85}{6} \\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{p,3} = \\frac{550}{60} = \\frac{55}{6} \\,\\mathrm{s}$\nThe number of engaged RNAPs for each transcript type is:\n$N_{p,1} = \\lambda_1 \\tau_{p,1} = (0.3) \\times (\\frac{115}{6}) = 5.75$\n$N_{p,2} = \\lambda_2 \\tau_{p,2} = (0.3) \\times (\\frac{85}{6}) = 4.25$\n$N_{p,3} = \\lambda_3 \\tau_{p,3} = (0.3) \\times (\\frac{55}{6}) = 2.75$\nThe total number of engaged RNAPs for the separate promoters architecture is the sum:\n$N_{p,\\mathrm{separate}} = N_{p,1} + N_{p,2} + N_{p,3} = 5.75 + 4.25 + 2.75 = 12.75$.\n\n**Difference in Total Resource Demand**\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta B$:\n$\\Delta B = N_{p,\\mathrm{operon}} - N_{p,\\mathrm{separate}} = 10.75 - 12.75 = -2$.\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$\\Delta B = -2.000$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the operon architecture has a lower total resource demand than the separate promoters architecture under these specific conditions. The savings come from reduced RNAP burden, as the non-coding overhead (leaders and terminators) is incurred only once for the operon, whereas it is incurred three times for the separate transcripts.",
