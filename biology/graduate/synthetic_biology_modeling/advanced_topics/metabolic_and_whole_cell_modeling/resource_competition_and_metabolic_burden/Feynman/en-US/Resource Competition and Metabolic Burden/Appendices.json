To assess energy-limited metabolic burden from translation, model the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) demand using the following fundamental biophysical assumptions grounded in the Central Dogma of molecular biology and well-established translation energetics:\n\n- Aminoacyl-tRNA charging by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases hydrolyzes one adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate and pyrophosphate per incorporated residue; count this as $2$ ATP equivalents per amino acid.\n- Translational elongation consumes two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules per incorporated residue, one associated with elongation factor Tu (delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA) and one with elongation factor G (ribosomal translocation); count each GTP hydrolysis as $1$ ATP equivalent. Translation initiation consumes $1$ GTP equivalent per protein, and translation termination consumes $1$ GTP equivalent per protein.\n- Neglect other costs (e.g., messenger ribonucleic acid transcription, chaperone-assisted folding, protein turnover) to isolate the translational energy demand.\n- Treat ATP equivalents from GTP hydrolysis as energetically equivalent to ATP hydrolysis for the purpose of energy accounting.\n\nA measured cellular ATP production rate under the same conditions is $R=2.5 \\times 10^{7}$ ATP molecules per minute per cell.\n\nUsing these assumptions, compute the fractional ATP demand $f$ from translation of this single protein relative to the measured ATP production rate, defined as the ratio of total ATP-equivalent demand for translation per minute to $R$.

This fraction is defined as the ratio of the total ATP-equivalent consumption rate for this process to the total cellular ATP production rate.\n\nThe formula for $f$ is:\n$$f = \\frac{D_{\\text{ATP}}}{R}$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{ATP}}$ is the total ATP-equivalent demand for translation per minute per cell, and $R$ is the total cellular ATP production rate.\n\nThe total ATP demand rate, $D_{\\text{ATP}}$, is the product of the number of proteins synthesized per minute, $q$, and the total ATP-equivalent cost to synthesize a single protein, $C_{\\text{protein}}$.\n$$D_{\\text{ATP}} = q \\times C_{\\text{protein}}$$\n\nTo find $C_{\\text{protein}}$, we must sum the energetic costs of each step of translation as specified in the problem statement. The costs are given for a protein of length $L$ amino acids.\n\n1.  **Aminoacyl-tRNA Charging Cost ($C_{\\text{charging}}$)**: Each of the $L$ amino acids must be attached to its corresponding tRNA. This process hydrolyzes one ATP to AMP, which is equivalent to the cleavage of two high-energy phosphate bonds.\n    The cost is given as $2$ ATP equivalents per amino acid.\n    $$C_{\\text{charging}} = 2 \\times L$$\n\n2.  **Translational Elongation Cost ($C_{\\text{elongation}}$)**: The problem defines this cost as $2$ GTP molecules per incorporated residue. Since each GTP is equivalent to $1$ ATP, this is $2$ ATP equivalents per residue. For a protein of length $L$, this model applies the cost to all $L$ residues.\n    $$C_{\\text{elongation}} = 2 \\times L$$\n\n3.  **Translation Initiation Cost ($C_{\\text{initiation}}$)**: This is a fixed cost per protein, given as $1$ GTP equivalent.\n    $$C_{\\text{initiation}} = 1$$\n\n4.  **Translation Termination Cost ($C_{\\text{termination}}$)**: This is also a fixed cost per protein, given as $1$ GTP equivalent.\n    $$C_{\\text{termination}} = 1$$\n\nThe total ATP-equivalent cost per protein, $C_{\\text{protein}}$, is the sum of these components:\n$$C_{\\text{protein}} = C_{\\text{charging}} + C_{\\text{elongation}} + C_{\\text{initiation}} + C_{\\text{termination}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{protein}} = 2L + 2L + 1 + 1 = 4L + 2$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.\nThe protein length is $L=300$ amino acids.\n$$C_{\\text{protein}} = 4(300) + 2 = 1200 + 2 = 1202 \\text{ ATP equivalents per protein}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total ATP demand rate, $D_{\\text{ATP}}$. The protein expression rate is $q=10\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n$$D_{\\text{ATP}} = q \\times C_{\\text{protein}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\times 1202\\,\\text{protein}^{-1} = 12020\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$$\nThe units are ATP equivalents per minute per cell.\n\nFinally, we compute the fractional demand $f$ using the given cellular ATP production rate, $R = 2.5 \\times 10^{7}$ ATP molecules per minute per cell.\n$$f = \\frac{D_{\\text{ATP}}}{R} = \\frac{12020}{2.5 \\times 10^{7}}$$\n$$f = \\frac{1.202 \\times 10^{4}}{2.5 \\times 10^{7}} = \\frac{1.202}{2.5} \\times 10^{4-7} = 0.4808 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$f = 0.0004808$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Let $P_{\\text{tot}}$ denote the total RNAP molecules per cell and $P_f$ the free (unbound) RNAP molecules. Each promoter site is either free or bound, and the law of mass action holds.\n\nThe synthetic circuit consists of two plasmids: plasmid $A$ with copy number $c_A = 30$, each bearing $n_A = 3$ identical promoters, and plasmid $B$ with copy number $c_B = 20$, each bearing $n_B = 5$ identical promoters.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) allocation between a synthetic circuit and the host genome under thermodynamic equilibrium. The solution will be derived from the first principles of statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics, specifically the law of mass action for molecular binding and the principle of mass conservation.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The binding of a free RNAP molecule, denoted as $P_f$, to any available promoter site, $S$, forms a bound complex, $C$. This reversible reaction is represented as:\n$$S + P_f \\rightleftharpoons C$$\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action. While $K_d$ is formally defined in terms of concentrations, we can express it using the number of molecules per cell since all species exist within the same cellular volume, causing the volume term to cancel out.\n$$K_d = \\frac{(\\text{number of free promoters}) \\cdot (\\text{number of free RNAP})}{(\\text{number of bound promoters})} = \\frac{[S] [P_f]}{[C]}$$\nLet $S_{\\mathrm{pool}}$ be the total number of promoters in a given pool. Each promoter is either free or bound, so $S_{\\mathrm{pool}} = [S] + [C]$. The number of bound promoters (which equals the number of RNAP molecules bound to that pool) is $[C]$. We can express $[C]$ in terms of the free RNAP, $P_f$.\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we have $[S] = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[P_f]}$. Substituting this into the conservation equation for promoters:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pool}} = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[P_f]} + [C] = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[P_f]} + 1 \\right) = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_d + [P_f]}{[P_f]} \\right)$$\nSolving for $[C]$, the number of bound RNAP molecules to this pool, we get:\n$$[C] = S_{\\mathrm{pool}} \\frac{[P_f]}{K_d + [P_f]}$$\nFor clarity, we will use $P_f$ instead of $[P_f]$ to denote the number of free RNAP molecules. The fraction of occupied promoters, $\\theta$, is thus given by $\\theta = \\frac{P_f}{K_d + P_f}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of promoters in each competing pool.\nThe synthetic circuit consists of two plasmids.\nNumber of promoters on plasmid A: $S_A = c_A \\cdot n_A = 30 \\times 3 = 90$.\nNumber of promoters on plasmid B: $S_B = c_B \\cdot n_B = 20 \\times 5 = 100$.\nTotal number of synthetic promoters: $S_{\\mathrm{syn}} = S_A + S_B = 90 + 100 = 190$.\n\nThe number of competing promoters from the host genome is given as $S_{\\mathrm{host}} = H = 1810$.\n\nThe total number of promoter sites competing for RNAP is the sum of all pools:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{total}} = S_{\\mathrm{syn}} + S_{\\mathrm{host}} = 190 + 1810 = 2000$$\n\nThe central principle for solving the system is the conservation of total RNAP.

The validation process confirms that the problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded within the context of simplified biochemical modeling, and contains all necessary information. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in how the finite pool of total ribosomes, $R_{\\text{tot}}$, is partitioned between its free form, $R_f$, and forms bound to messenger RNA (mRNA) of the reporter ($R$) and competitor ($C$). The protein production rate for any species $i$, $\\pi_i$, is directly proportional to the number of ribosomes bound to its mRNA, $b_i$.\n\nLet us first establish the governing equations based on the problem statement.\nThe number of ribosomes bound to mRNA species $i$ is given by the law of mass action at equilibrium. The binding reaction is $R_f + \\text{mRNA}_i \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Complex}_i$. The number of complexes is $b_i$. The dissociation constant $K_d$ is defined, in terms of molecular counts, as $K_d = \\frac{R_f \\cdot m_{i, \\text{free}}}{b_i}$.
