This first exercise provides a concrete opportunity to simulate the step-by-step evolution of a small, hypothetical gene regulatory network. By manually applying the given logical update rules in a synchronous manner, you will trace the network's trajectory from a specified initial state, building an intuitive feel for how interconnected rules produce dynamic behavior over time .",

            "problem": "A team of synthetic biologists is modeling a simple gene regulatory network within an engineered bacterium. The network consists of three genes, which we will label A, B, and C. The state of each gene can be either \"ON\" (active), represented by the integer 1, or \"OFF\" (inactive), represented by the integer 0. The state of the entire network evolves in discrete time steps. The states of all three genes are updated simultaneously (synchronously) based on the network's state at the previous time step.\n\nThe regulatory logic is as follows:\n- Gene A is activated at time $t+1$ if, at time $t$, either gene B was ON or gene C was ON. Otherwise, gene A is turned OFF.\n- Gene B's regulation involves a self-inhibitory loop and an external override. At time $t+1$, gene B will be in the opposite state to its state at time $t$, unless gene C was ON at time $t$. If gene C was ON at time $t$, gene B is forced OFF at time $t+1$ regardless of its previous state.\n- Gene C is activated at time $t+1$ if and only if gene A was ON and gene B was OFF at time $t$. For all other conditions, gene C is turned OFF.\n\nIf the network starts at time $t=0$ with gene A OFF, gene B ON, and gene C OFF, what is the state of the network (A, B, C) at time $t=3$?

            "introduction": "While simulating a few time steps is instructive, the ultimate goal of network modeling is often to understand its long-term behavior. This practice moves into the realm of attractors—the steady states or limit cycles that a system eventually settles into.

The state of each gene can be either 'off' (represented by 0) or 'on' (represented by 1). The state of the entire system at a discrete time step $t$ is given by the ordered triple $S(t) = (g_1(t), g_2(t), g_3(t))$, where $g_i(t)$ is the state of gene $G_i$. The system evolves in synchronous discrete time steps according to the following Boolean update rules, where $g'_i$ denotes the state of gene $G_i$ at time $t+1$:\n\n$$\ng'_1 = \\neg g_2(t) \\\\\ng'_2 = \\neg g_3(t) \\\\\ng'_3 = \\neg g_1(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\neg$ represents the logical NOT operator. The long-term behavior of the system from a given initial state is to settle into an attractor, which can be a single stable state (a fixed point) or a repeating sequence of states (a limit cycle). The set of all initial states that lead to a particular attractor is called its basin of attraction.\n\nThe Hamming distance between two states is the number of gene states in which they differ.

This exercise highlights the profound impact of the update scheme on a network's predicted dynamics by contrasting synchronous and asynchronous updates. Given a network with a known attractor under synchronous updates, you will investigate its stability under a general asynchronous (GA) scheme, where nodes update one at a time.

            "problem": "In the study of genetic regulatory networks, Boolean network models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for understanding system dynamics. A network's evolution can be modeled using different update schemes. In a synchronous scheme, all nodes update their states simultaneously at each discrete time step. In contrast, under a General Asynchronous (GA) scheme, only one node, chosen uniformly at random at each time step, updates its state.\n\nConsider a small hypothetical gene regulatory network consisting of three nodes (genes), represented by Boolean variables $X_1, X_2, \\text{ and } X_3$, where a state of 1 represents an \"ON\" (expressed) gene and 0 represents an \"OFF\" (inhibited) gene.
