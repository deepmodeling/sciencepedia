The numerical values are physically realistic for biological systems. The problem is objective and free of ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nNow, we proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $R$ represent the free regulator protein, $L$ represent the free ligand, and $RL$ represent the ligand-bound regulator complex. The binding reaction at equilibrium is:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants to the equilibrium concentration of the product:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of the free regulator, free ligand, and the complex, respectively. The problem statement defines $L$ as the free ligand concentration, so we can use $L$ in place of $[L]$.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of ligand-bound regulators to the total concentration of regulators. The total concentration of regulators, $[R]_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of the free and bound forms:\n$$[R]_{total} = [R] + [RL]$$\nThus, the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\n\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $L$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from the equation for $\\theta$. From the definition of $K_d$, we can express the concentration of the free regulator, $[R]$, as:\n$$[R] = K_d \\frac{[RL]}{L}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left( K_d \\frac{[RL]}{L} \\right) + [RL]}$$\n\nThe term $[RL]$ is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator, so it can be factored out and cancelled:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{L} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1}$$\n\nTo obtain a more conventional form, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $L$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{L}{L\\left(\\frac{K_d}{L} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{L}{K_d + L}$$\n\nThis expression represents the fractional occupancy for a single, noncooperative binding site. It is a specific case of the Hill equation, $\\theta = \\frac{L^n}{K^n + L^n}$, where the Hill coefficient $n=1$. In this noncooperative limit, the dissociation constant $K_d$ is equal to the ligand concentration that yields half-saturation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\theta$ using the given numerical values: $K_d = 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M}$ and $L = 2 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{M}$.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-7}}{10^{-7} + 2 \\times 10^{-7}}$$\nWe can factor out $10^{-7}$ from the denominator:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-7}}{(1 + 2) \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-7}}{3 \\times 10^{-7}}$$\nThe term $10^{-7}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThis is a reduced fraction as requested.\n\nFinally, we must determine if the site is at half-saturation.

Half-saturation occurs specifically when the ligand concentration $L$ is equal to the dissociation constant $K_d$.

This is a common simplification used in systems and synthetic biology to model transcriptional switches. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters chosen are physically realistic for biomolecular interactions. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent, with no violations of scientific principles or logical contradictions. It does not fall into any of the invalid categories.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Fractional Activation $f(L)$**\n\nThe problem specifies a concerted binding model where the promoter $S$ can be in one of two dominant states: unbound, $S_0$, or fully bound by $n$ ligands $L$, denoted as $S_n$. The equilibrium reaction is:\n$$S_0 + nL \\rightleftharpoons S_n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, a dissociation constant for this reaction, let us call it $K_D$, can be written as:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[S_0][L]^n}{[S_n]}$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes concentration. This $K_D$ has units of concentration to the power of $n$. The problem defines an \"apparent dissociation constant\" $K$ with units of concentration (as evidenced by the given value $K=50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$). This is standard practice, where $K$ represents the ligand concentration at which the fractional saturation is one-half. Let's relate $K_D$ to this parameter $K$.\n\nFrom the mass action equation, we can express the ratio of the concentrations of the two states:\n$$\\frac{[S_n]}{[S_0]} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_D}$$\nThe fractional activation, $f(L)$, is the fraction of promoters in the activated state, $S_n$. Since intermediate states are negligible, the total concentration of promoter is $[S]_{total} = [S_0] + [S_n]$.\n$$f(L) = \\frac{[S_n]}{[S]_{total}} = \\frac{[S_n]}{[S_0] + [S_n]}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $[S_0]$:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{[S_n]/[S_0]}{1 + [S_n]/[S_0]}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio of concentrations:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{[L]^n/K_D}{1 + [L]^n/K_D} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_D + [L]^n}$$\nNow, we use the definition of the apparent dissociation constant $K$ as the concentration $L$ at which $f(L) = 1/2$.\n$$f(L=K) = \\frac{K^n}{K_D + K^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSolving for $K_D$:\n$$2K^n = K_D + K^n$$\n$$K_D = K^n$$\nThis confirms the relationship between the macroscopic dissociation constant $K_D$ (with units of concentration$^n$) and the apparent dissociation constant $K$ (with units of concentration). Substituting $K^n$ for $K_D$ into the equation for $f(L)$ yields the final form, known as the Hill function:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{L^n}{K^n + L^n}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nGiven the parameters $n=3$ and $K=50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, the activation function is:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{L^3}{(50)^3 + L^3}$$\nWe evaluate this function at the specified concentrations of $L$. Note that since $L$ and $K$ have the same units, the units cancel out, and $f(L)$ is dimensionless.\n\n1.  For $L = 10\\ \\mathrm{nM}$:\n    $$f(10) = \\frac{10^3}{50^3 + 10^3} = \\frac{1000}{125000 + 1000} = \\frac{1000}{126000} = \\frac{1}{126} \\approx 0.0079365...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $f(10) \\approx 0.007937$.\n\n2.  For $L = 50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$:\n    $$f(50) = \\frac{50^3}{50^3 + 50^3} = \\frac{50^3}{2 \\times 50^3} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n    As required by the definition of $K$. Expressed with four significant figures, this is $0.5000$.\n\n3.  For $L = 200\\ \\mathrm{nM}$:\n    $$f(200) = \\frac{200^3}{50^3 + 200^3} = \\frac{(4 \\times 50)^3}{50^3 + (4 \\times 50)^3} = \\frac{4^3 \\times 50^3}{50^3(1 + 4^3)} = \\frac{64}{1 + 64} = \\frac{64}{65} \\approx 0.984615...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $f(200) \\approx 0.9846$.\n\n**Interpretation of Curve Steepness and Symmetry**\n\n**Steepness:** The steepness of the response characterizes its sensitivity to changes in ligand concentration. A common and useful measure of sensitivity is the slope of the activation curve on a semi-log plot, i.e., $df/d(\\ln L)$. This quantity is dimensionless.\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{df}{d(\\ln L)} = \\frac{df}{dL} \\frac{dL}{d(\\ln L)} = L \\frac{df}{dL}$.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $f(L)$ with respect to $L$ using the quotient rule:\n$$f(L) = \\frac{L^n}{K^n + L^n}$$\n$$\\frac{df}{dL} = \\frac{(nL^{n-1})(K^n + L^n) - (L^n)(nL^{n-1})}{(K^n + L^n)^2} = \\frac{nK^nL^{n-1}}{(K^n + L^n)^2}$$\nNow, we find the log-scale sensitivity:\n$$\\frac{df}{d(\\ln L)} = L \\left( \\frac{nK^nL^{n-1}}{(K^n + L^n)^2} \\right) = \\frac{nK^nL^n}{(K^n + L^n)^2}$$\nThe steepness is typically evaluated at the midpoint of the curve, $L=K$, where the slope is maximal.\n$$\\left. \\frac{df}{d(\\ln L)} \\right|_{L=K} = \\frac{nK^nK^n}{(K^n + K^n)^2} = \\frac{nK^{2n}}{(2K^n)^2} = \\frac{nK^{2n}}{4K^{2n}} = \\frac{n}{4}$$\nThis result demonstrates that the steepness of the activation curve at its midpoint is directly proportional to the Hill coefficient $n$. A larger $n$ signifies stronger cooperativity and results in a more switch-like, or \"ultrasensitive\", response. This means that a small change in ligand concentration around $K$ can cause a large change in promoter activation.\n\n**Symmetry:** To analyze the symmetry of the curve on a logarithmic concentration scale, we define a new variable $x = \\ln(L/K)$. This means $L = K\\exp(x)$. The midpoint of the curve, $L=K$, now corresponds to $x=0$. We substitute this into the function $f(L)$:\n$$f(L(x)) = \\frac{(K\\exp(x))^n}{K^n + (K\\exp(x))^n} = \\frac{K^n\\exp(nx)}{K^n(1 + \\exp(nx))} = \\frac{\\exp(nx)}{1 + \\exp(nx)}$$\nLet's call this new function $g(x)$. To check for point symmetry around the point $(x=0, f=1/2)$, we examine the sum $g(x) + g(-x)$:\n$$g(-x) = \\frac{\\exp(-nx)}{1 + \\exp(-nx)}$$\nTo simplify $g(-x)$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(nx)$:\n$$g(-x) = \\frac{\\exp(-nx)\\exp(nx)}{(1 + \\exp(-nx))\\exp(nx)} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(nx) + 1}$$\nNow, we compute the sum:\n$$g(x) + g(-x) = \\frac{\\exp(nx)}{1 + \\exp(nx)} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(nx)} = \\frac{\\exp(nx) + 1}{1 + \\exp(nx)} = 1$$\nThe relation $g(x) + g(-x) = 1$ demonstrates that the function has point symmetry about $(0, 1/2)$. In terms of the original variables, this means the plot of $f(L)$ versus $\\log(L)$ is symmetric about the point $(\\log(K), 1/2)$. This symmetry implies that a given fold-change in concentration relative to $K$ (e.g., multiplying by a factor $c$) produces a response that is complementary to the response produced by the inverse fold-change (dividing by $c$). That is, $f(cK) + f(K/c) = 1$ for any $c  0$.",

In the context of the Hill model derived from such a simplified reaction, $K_D$ is related to $K$ by $K_D = K^n$. This convention defines $K$ as the concentration yielding half-maximal response, a standard practice.

The fold-change in concentration required to move the output from $p=0.1$ to $p=0.9$ depends on $K$.**\nThe fold-change in concentration is the width $W$. Our derivation shows that $W = 81^{1/n}$. This expression depends only on the Hill coefficient $n$ and is independent of the dissociation constant $K$. $K$ determines the location (midpoint) of the response curve on the concentration axis, but not its steepness or fold-width between fixed output percentages.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Increasing $n$ decreases the fold-width between $p=0.1$ and $p=0.9$, while the midpoint concentration $c_{0.5}$ remains equal to $K$.**\nFirst part: The fold-width is $W(n) = 81^{1/n}$. As $n$ increases, the exponent $1/n$ decreases. Since the base ($81$) is greater than $1$, the function $W(n)$ is a decreasing function of $n$. This means increasing cooperativity (a higher $n$) leads to a steeper, more switch-like response, thus a smaller fold-width.\nSecond part: The midpoint concentration is $c_{0.5}$. Using our formula for $c_p$:\n$$c_{0.5} = K \\left(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}\\right)^{1/n} = K \\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.5}\\right)^{1/n} = K(1)^{1/n} = K$$\nThe midpoint concentration is indeed equal to $K$ and does not depend on $n$. Both parts of the statement are accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. If $c_{\\max}/c_{\\min} = 100$ and $n=4$, then for any choice of $K$, the entire responsive window from $p=0.1$ to $p=0.9$ lies within $[c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$.**\nFor $n=4$, the width of the responsive window is $W = 81^{1/4} = (3^4)^{1/4} = 3$. The available concentration range has a fold-width of $c_{\\max}/c_{\\min} = 100$. Since $3  100$, it is possible to fit the responsive window within the available range. However, the statement claims this is true \"for any choice of $K$\". The position of the window $[c_{0.1}, c_{0.9}]$ is determined by $K$. If we choose a very small $K$, for example $K  c_{\\min}$, the entire window could be below $c_{\\min}$. Similarly, if we choose a very large $K$, for example $K  c_{\\max}$, the window will be above $c_{\\max}$. For instance, if $K = c_{\\min}/10$, then $c_{0.5} = c_{\\min}/10$, and $c_{0.1} = c_{0.5} / (9^{1/4}) = (c_{\\min}/10)/\\sqrt{3}  c_{\\min}$. Thus, the window is not contained in the specified range. The statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Choosing $K = \\sqrt{c_{\\min} c_{\\max}}$ centers the responsive window on the logarithmic scale of $c$ within $[c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$, thereby maximizing the margin to both bounds for a given $n$.**\nThe responsive window is the interval $[c_{0.1}, c_{0.9}]$. Its geometric mean, which represents its center on a logarithmic scale, is $\\sqrt{c_{0.1} \\cdot c_{0.9}}$.\n$$\\sqrt{c_{0.1} \\cdot c_{0.9}} = \\sqrt{K(1/9)^{1/n} \\cdot K(9)^{1/n}} = \\sqrt{K^2 (1/9 \\cdot 9)^{1/n}} = \\sqrt{K^2 (1)^{1/n}} = K$$\nThe center of the available range $[c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$ on a logarithmic scale is $\\sqrt{c_{\\min} c_{\\max}}$. Therefore, setting $K = \\sqrt{c_{\\min} c_{\\max}}$ aligns the center of the responsive window with the center of the available range. This positioning equalizes the multiplicative margins to the boundaries. The margin to the lower bound is the ratio $c_{0.1}/c_{\\min}$ and the margin to the upper bound is $c_{\\max}/c_{0.9}$. Maximizing the worst-case (minimum) margin is achieved when these two margins are equal: $c_{0.1}/c_{\\min} = c_{\\max}/c_{0.9}$, which implies $c_{0.1}c_{0.9} = c_{\\min}c_{\\max}$. Since $c_{0.1}c_{0.9} = K^2$, this leads to $K^2 = c_{\\min}c_{\\max}$, or $K = \\sqrt{c_{\\min} c_{\\max}}$. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For fixed $c_{\\min}$ and $c_{\\max}$, the set of $K$ values that keep $[c_{0.1}, c_{0.9}] \\subseteq [c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$ becomes wider (in multiplicative terms) as $n$ increases.**\nFor the responsive window to be contained within the available range, we must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $c_{0.1} \\ge c_{\\min} \\implies K(1/9)^{1/n} \\ge c_{\\min} \\implies K \\ge c_{\\min} (9)^{1/n}$\n2.  $c_{0.9} \\le c_{\\max} \\implies K(9)^{1/n} \\le c_{\\max} \\implies K \\le c_{\\max} (1/9)^{1/n} = c_{\\max} 9^{-1/n}$\nThe set of allowed $K$ values is the interval $[c_{\\min} 9^{1/n}, c_{\\max} 9^{-1/n}]$. For this interval to be valid, we need $c_{\\min} 9^{1/n} \\le c_{\\max} 9^{-1/n}$, which means $c_{\\max}/c_{\\min} \\ge 9^{2/n} = 81^{1/n} = W$. Given $c_{\\max}/c_{\\min} = 100$, this condition is met for any realistic $n \\ge 1$.\nThe \"width in multiplicative terms\" is the ratio of the upper bound of this interval to the lower bound:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{K_{\\text{upper}}}{K_{\\text{lower}}} = \\frac{c_{\\max} 9^{-1/n}}{c_{\\min} 9^{1/n}} = \\left(\\frac{c_{\\max}}{c_{\\min}}\\right) 9^{-2/n} = 100 \\cdot (81)^{-1/n}$$\nWe examine how this ratio changes as $n$ increases. As $n$ increases, $1/n$ decreases toward $0$. The exponent $-1/n$ increases toward $0$. Since the base ($81$) is greater than $1$, the term $(81)^{-1/n}$ is an increasing function of $n$. Therefore, the multiplicative width of the allowed set for $K$ increases as $n$ increases.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
