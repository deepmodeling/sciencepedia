Derivation of Rate Laws\n\n#### 1.1 Competitive Inhibition\nIn competitive inhibition, the inhibitor $I$ binds only to the free enzyme $E$, competing with the substrate $S$. The reaction scheme is:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI$$\nThe rate of reaction is $v = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$.\nThe total enzyme concentration is conserved: $[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$.\nWe apply the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) to the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] = 0$$\nThis gives $k_1[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES]$. Using the definition $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$, we have:\n$$[E][S] = K_m[ES] \\implies [E] = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}$$\nWe assume the inhibitor binding is in rapid equilibrium, characterized by the dissociation constant $K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$. Thus:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $[E]$ and $[EI]$ into the enzyme conservation equation:\n$$[E]_T = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\left(\\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}\\right)\\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nFactoring out $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_T = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{K_m[I]}{[S]K_i} \\right) = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}{[S]} \\right)$$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T[S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}$$\nThe rate law is $v = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$. Substituting the expression for $[ES]$ and $V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T$:\n$$v_{\\text{competitive}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}$$\n\n#### 1.2 Pure Non-Competitive Inhibition\nIn pure non-competitive inhibition, the inhibitor can bind to both the free enzyme $E$ and the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$ with the same affinity. The ESI complex is non-productive.\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI \\quad (K_i)$$\n$$ES + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ESI \\quad (K_i)$$\nThe rate of reaction is $v = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$.\nThe total enzyme concentration is $[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + [EI] + [ESI]$.\nAssuming rapid equilibrium for inhibitor binding:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [ESI] = \\frac{[ES][I]}{K_i}$$\nSubstitute these into the conservation equation:\n$$[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} + \\frac{[ES][I]}{K_i} = [E]\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [ES]\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\n$$[E]_T = ([E] + [ES])\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nApplying the QSSA to the formation and breakdown of $[ES]$ as before, we have $[E] = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}$.

Calculation of Fold-Change\nThe fold-change $f$ is the ratio of the inhibited rate $v_{\\text{inh}}$ to the uninhibited rate $v_0$. First, we calculate $v_0$ using the standard Michaelis-Menten equation (which is the limit of the inhibited equations as $[I] \\to 0$):\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} = \\frac{(1\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})(25\\,\\mu\\text{M})}{50\\,\\mu\\text{M} + 25\\,\\mu\\text{M}} = \\frac{25}{75}\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nFor **competitive inhibition**:\n$$f_{\\text{competitive}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{competitive}}}{v_0} = \\frac{1/7}{1/3} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\text{competitive}} \\approx 0.4286$.\n\nFor **pure non-competitive inhibition**:\n$$f_{\\text{non-competitive}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{non-competitive}}}{v_0} = \\frac{1/9}{1/3} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\text{non-competitive}} \\approx 0.3333$.\n\nFinal results are:\n$v_{\\text{competitive}} = 0.1429\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$v_{\\text{non-competitive}} = 0.1111\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$f_{\\text{competitive}} = 0.4286$\n$f_{\\text{non-competitive}} = 0.3333$",

Since $K_i$ and $K_m$ are positive constants for a given system, $IC_{50}$ increases linearly with $[S]$.

Substituting $\\sigma$ into the ratio expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{IC_{50}(2[S])}{IC_{50}([S])} = \\frac{1 + 2\\sigma}{1 + \\sigma}\n$$\nThis is the final simplified expression required.\n\n**Contextual Justification for Non-Competitive Inhibition**\n\nFor context, let's consider a purely non-competitive inhibitor. This type of inhibitor binds with equal affinity, $K_i$, to both the free enzyme $E$ and the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$. The resulting $ESI$ complex is non-productive. The velocity equation for non-competitive inhibition is:\n$$\nv([I];[S]) = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{ \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) ([S] + K_m) } = \\frac{v_0}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}\n$$\nUsing the definition $v(IC_{50};[S]) = \\frac{1}{2}v_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_0}{1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}} = \\frac{1}{2}v_0\n$$\nCanceling $v_0$ gives:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i} = 2\n$$\n$$\nIC_{50} = K_i\n$$\nThus, for a purely non-competitive inhibitor, $IC_{50}$ is a constant equal to $K_i$ and is independent of the substrate concentration $[S]$. This is because the inhibitor simply reduces the apparent $V_{\\text{max}}$ without affecting substrate binding, so the fractional inhibition at a given $[I]$ is the same regardless of $[S]$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of an optimal experimental design for estimating the competitive inhibition constant, $K_i$, in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The design is to be chosen from discrete sets of substrate and inhibitor concentrations. The optimality criterion is the minimization of the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on the variance of the estimator for $K_i$. This task falls under the purview of optimal experimental design for nonlinear parameter estimation, a cornerstone of quantitative modeling in systems and synthetic biology.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, the establishment of the theoretical framework using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM); second, the derivation of the specific components of the FIM for the competitive inhibition model; and third, the implementation of an exhaustive search algorithm to find the optimal design.\n\n**1. Theoretical Framework: Fisher Information and the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound**\n\nThe experimental setup involves observing the reaction velocity, $v$, which is corrupted by noise. The model for a single observation $y_j$ is given as:\n$$\ny_j = v([S]_j, [I]_j; \\theta) + \\varepsilon_j, \\quad \\varepsilon_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta = (V_{\\max}, K_m, K_i)$ is the vector of parameters to be estimated. The measurement errors $\\varepsilon_j$ are assumed to be independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variables with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for a single measurement at a design point $([S], [I])$ is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, $J(\\theta, [S], [I])$, whose elements are given by:\n$$\n[J(\\theta)]_{kl} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\theta_k} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\theta_l}\n$$\nHere, $\\theta_1 = V_{\\max}$, $\\theta_2 = K_m$, and $\\theta_3 = K_i$. The vector of partial derivatives, $\\nabla_\\theta v = \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial V_{\\max}}, \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial K_m}, \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial K_i} \\right)^T$, is known as the sensitivity vector. The FIM for a single point can be written as the outer product of the sensitivity vector, scaled by the inverse noise variance:\n$$\nJ(\\theta, [S], [I]) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} (\\nabla_\\theta v) (\\nabla_\\theta v)^T\n$$\nAn experimental design consists of a set of $N$ design points, $\\{([S]_j, [I]_j)\\}_{j=1}^N$, with $r_j$ replicate measurements at each point. Since FIMs are additive for independent measurements, the total FIM for the experiment is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}}(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} r_j J(\\theta, [S]_j, [I]_j)\n$$\nIn this specific problem, the design is a full factorial design with $n_S$ substrate levels and $n_I$ inhibitor levels, giving $N = n_S \\times n_I$ unique design points, each with $r$ replicates. The total FIM is thus:\n$$\nJ(\\theta) = r \\sum_{j=1}^{n_S} \\sum_{k=1}^{n_I} J(\\theta, [S]_j, [I]_k) = \\frac{r}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_S} \\sum_{k=1}^{n_I} (\\nabla_\\theta v_{jk}) (\\nabla_\\theta v_{jk})^T\n$$\nwhere $v_{jk}$ is the velocity at $([S]_j, [I]_k)$.\n\nThe Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) theorem states that the covariance matrix of any unbiased estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ is bounded from below by the inverse of the FIM: $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\ge J(\\theta)^{-1}$. The variance of the estimator for a single parameter, $\\hat{\\theta}_k$, is thus bounded by the corresponding diagonal element of the inverse FIM:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_k) \\ge [J(\\theta)^{-1}]_{kk}\n$$\nOur objective is to minimize the variance bound for the estimation of $K_i$, which corresponds to the third parameter ($\\theta_3$). The objective function to minimize is therefore $[J(\\theta)^{-1}]_{33}$. This is a specific instance of $c$-optimal design, where we aim to minimize $c^T J^{-1} c$ with $c = (0, 0, 1)^T$. It is important to note that for nonlinear models, the FIM and thus the optimal design depend on the true values of the parameters $\\theta$. This necessitates using prior estimates for the parameters, as provided in the test cases.\n\n**2. Model-Specific Derivations**\n\nThe reaction velocity $v$ for competitive inhibition is:\n$$\nv([S],[I]; \\theta) = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\,[S]}{K_m\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}\n$$\nTo construct the FIM, we must compute the partial derivatives of $v$ with respect to each parameter in $\\theta = (V_{\\max}, K_m, K_i)$. For clarity, let the apparent Michaelis constant be $K_{m, \\text{app}} = K_m(1 + [I]/K_i)$, so the denominator is $D = K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S]$.\n\nThe sensitivities are:\n1.  With respect to $V_{\\max}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial V_{\\max}} = \\frac{[S]}{K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S]} = \\frac{v}{V_{\\max}} $$\n2.  With respect to $K_m$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial K_m} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial K_{m, \\text{app}}} \\frac{\\partial K_{m, \\text{app}}}{\\partial K_m} = \\left( \\frac{-V_{\\max}[S]}{(K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S])^2} \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right) = \\frac{-v(1+[I]/K_i)}{K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S]} $$\n3.  With respect to $K_i$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial K_i} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial K_{m, \\text{app}}} \\frac{\\partial K_{m, \\text{app}}}{\\partial K_i} = \\left( \\frac{-V_{\\max}[S]}{(K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S])^2} \\right) \\left( K_m \\frac{-[I]}{K_i^2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]K_m[I]}{K_i^2 (K_{m, \\text{app}} + [S])^2} $$\n\nThese three expressions form the components of the sensitivity vector $\\nabla_\\theta v$, which are evaluated at each design point $([S]_j, [I]_k)$ using the provided true parameter values.\n\n**3. Algorithmic Design and Implementation**\n\nThe problem specifies finding the optimal combination of $n_S$ substrate levels and $n_I$ inhibitor levels from given finite candidate sets. This suggests an exhaustive search over all possible designs. The implementation of this algorithm is provided in the Python code below, which follows the logic described here. The code iterates through all combinations of substrate and inhibitor concentrations, calculates the total FIM for each design, computes the inverse FIM, and identifies the design that minimizes the CRLB for $K_i$, including the specified tie-breaking rules.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives, implements, and applies an optimal experimental design for estimating\n    the competitive inhibition constant, Ki.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"params\": {\"Vmax\": 120.0, \"Km\": 60.0, \"Ki\": 90.0},\n            \"sigma2\": 4.0, \"r\": 3, \"nS\": 3, \"nI\": 3,\n            \"S_candidates\": [10.0, 30.0, 60.0, 120.0, 300.0, 600.0],\n            \"I_candidates\": [0.0, 10.0, 50.0, 90.0, 150.0, 300.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"params\": {\"Vmax\": 100.0, \"Km\": 50.0, \"Ki\": 1000.0},\n            \"sigma2\": 1.0, \"r\": 3, \"nS\": 3, \"nI\": 3,\n            \"S_candidates\": [5.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100.0, 250.0, 500.0],\n            \"I_candidates\": [0.0, 50.0, 200.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"params\": {\"Vmax\": 80.0, \"Km\": 40.0, \"Ki\": 10.0},\n            \"sigma2\": 9.0, \"r\": 4, \"nS\": 3, \"nI\": 3,\n            \"S_candidates\": [5.0, 20.0, 40.0, 80.0, 160.0, 320.0],\n            \"I_candidates\": [0.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Vmax = case[\"params\"][\"Vmax\"]\n        Km = case[\"params\"][\"Km\"]\n        Ki = case[\"params\"][\"Ki\"]\n        sigma2 = case[\"sigma2\"]\n        r = case[\"r\"]\n        nS = case[\"nS\"]\n        nI = case[\"nI\"]\n        S_candidates = case[\"S_candidates\"]\n        I_candidates = case[\"I_candidates\"]\n\n        min_crlb = float('inf')\n        best_design = None\n\n        s_combos = list(combinations(S_candidates, nS))\n        i_combos = list(combinations(I_candidates, nI))\n\n        for s_selection in s_combos:\n            for i_selection in i_combos:\n                \n                fim_sum = np.zeros((3, 3))\n                \n                for S in s_selection:\n                    for I in i_selection:\n                        # Calculate sensitivities for this design point (S, I)\n                        Km_app = Km * (1.0 + I / Ki)\n                        denominator = Km_app + S\n                        \n                        dv_dVmax = S / denominator\n                        dv_dKm = -Vmax * S * (1.0 + I / Ki) / (denominator**2)\n                        dv_dKi = Vmax * S * Km * I / (Ki**2 * denominator**2)\n                        \n                        grad_v = np.array([dv_dVmax, dv_dKm, dv_dKi])\n                        fim_sum += np.outer(grad_v, grad_v)\n\n                # Calculate total Fisher Information Matrix\n                J = (r / sigma2) * fim_sum\n\n                # Calculate CRLB for Ki\n                try:\n                    J_inv = np.linalg.inv(J)\n                    crlb_ki = J_inv[2, 2]\n                except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n                    crlb_ki = float('inf')\n\n                # Update best design if a better one is found\n                if crlb_ki  min_crlb:\n                    min_crlb = crlb_ki\n                    best_design = (s_selection, i_selection)\n                elif np.isclose(crlb_ki, min_crlb):\n                    # Tie-breaking logic\n                    current_s_list = sorted(list(s_selection))\n                    current_i_list = sorted(list(i_selection))\n                    best_s_list = sorted(list(best_design[0]))\n                    best_i_list = sorted(list(best_design[1]))\n                    \n                    if current_s_list  best_s_list:\n                        best_design = (s_selection, i_selection)\n                    elif current_s_list == best_s_list and current_i_list  best_i_list:\n                        best_design = (s_selection, i_selection)\n                        \n        s_list = sorted(list(best_design[0]))\n        i_list = sorted(list(best_design[1]))\n        \n        all_results.append([s_list, i_list, min_crlb])\n\n    # The problem specifies a precise list-of-lists string format.\n    # The default python str() representation of a list of lists matches this.\n    return str(all_results)\n```",
