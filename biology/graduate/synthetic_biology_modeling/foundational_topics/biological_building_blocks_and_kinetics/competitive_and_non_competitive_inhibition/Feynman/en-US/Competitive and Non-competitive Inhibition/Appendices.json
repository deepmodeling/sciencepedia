Derivation of Rate Laws\n\n#### 1.1 Competitive Inhibition\nIn competitive inhibition, the inhibitor $I$ binds only to the free enzyme $E$, competing with the substrate $S$. The reaction scheme is:\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI$$\nThe rate of reaction is $v = k_{cat}[ES]$.\nThe total enzyme concentration is conserved: $[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$.\nWe apply the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) to the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$:\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] = 0$$\nThis gives $k_1[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]$. Using the definition $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_1}$, we have:\n$$[E][S] = K_m[ES] \\implies [E] = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}$$\nWe assume the inhibitor binding is in rapid equilibrium, characterized by the dissociation constant $K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$. Thus:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $[E]$ and $[EI]$ into the enzyme conservation equation:\n$$[E]_t = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\left(\\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}\\right)\\frac{[I]}{K_i}$$\nFactoring out $[ES]$:\n$$[E]_t = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{K_m[I]}{[S]K_i} \\right) = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}{[S]} \\right)$$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_t[S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}$$\nThe rate law is $v = k_{cat}[ES]$. Substituting the expression for $[ES]$ and $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_t$:\n$$v_{\\text{competitive}} = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}$$\n\n#### 1.2 Pure Non-Competitive Inhibition\nIn pure non-competitive inhibition, the inhibitor can bind to both the free enzyme $E$ and the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$ with the same affinity. The ESI complex is non-productive.\n$$E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{cat}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$$\n$$E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI \\quad (K_i)$$\n$$ES + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ESI \\quad (K_i)$$\nThe rate of reaction is $v = k_{cat}[ES]$.\nThe total enzyme concentration is $[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI] + [ESI]$.\nAssuming rapid equilibrium for inhibitor binding:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [ESI] = \\frac{[ES][I]}{K_i}$$\nSubstitute these into the conservation equation:\n$$[E]_t = [E] + [ES] + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i} + \\frac{[ES][I]}{K_i} = [E]\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [ES]\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\n$$[E]_t = ([E] + [ES])\\left(1+\\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nApplying the QSSA to the formation and breakdown of $[ES]$ as before, we have $[E] = \\frac{K_m[ES]}{[S]}$.

Calculation of Fold-Change\nThe fold-change $f$ is the ratio of the inhibited rate $v_{\\text{inh}}$ to the uninhibited rate $v_0$. First, we calculate $v_0$ using the standard Michaelis-Menten equation (which is the limit of the inhibited equations as $[I] \\to 0$):\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]} = \\frac{(1\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})(25\\,\\mu\\text{M})}{50\\,\\mu\\text{M} + 25\\,\\mu\\text{M}} = \\frac{25}{75}\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nFor **competitive inhibition**:\n$$f_{\\text{competitive}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{competitive}}}{v_0} = \\frac{1/7}{1/3} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\text{competitive}} \\approx 0.4286$.\n\nFor **pure non-competitive inhibition**:\n$$f_{\\text{non\\text{-}competitive}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{non\\text{-}competitive}}}{v_0} = \\frac{1/9}{1/3} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{\\text{non\\text{-}competitive}} \\approx 0.3333$.\n\nFinal results are:\n$v_{\\text{competitive}} = 0.1429\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$v_{\\text{non\\text{-}competitive}} = 0.1111\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$f_{\\text{competitive}} = 0.4286$\n$f_{\\text{non\\text{-}competitive}} = 0.3333$",

A competitive inhibitor $I$ binds only to free enzyme $E$ to form $EI$ that does not bind substrate. Assume mass-action kinetics for all bindings and define the Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ for the substrate binding step and the dissociation constant $K_{i}$ for inhibitor binding.

Since $K_i$ and $K_m$ are positive constants for a given system, $IC_{50}$ increases linearly with $[S]$. This is a hallmark of competitive inhibition: higher substrate concentrations require higher inhibitor concentrations to achieve the same level of inhibition, as the substrate and inhibitor are competing for the same binding site on the free enzyme.\n\n**3) Calculation of the Ratio $\\frac{IC_{50}(2[S])}{IC_{50}([S])}$**\n\nUsing the expression derived in part (1), we can write the $IC_{50}$ at substrate concentration $2[S]$:\n$$\nIC_{50}(2[S]) = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{2[S]}{K_m}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{IC_{50}(2[S])}{IC_{50}([S])} = \\frac{K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{2[S]}{K_m}\\right)}{K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{2[S]}{K_m}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the dimensionless substrate saturation variable $\\sigma \\equiv \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}}$. Substituting $\\sigma$ into the ratio expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{IC_{50}(2[S])}{IC_{50}([S])} = \\frac{1 + 2\\sigma}{1 + \\sigma}\n$$\nThis is the final simplified expression required.\n\n**Contextual Justification for Non-Competitive Inhibition**\n\nFor context, let's consider a purely non-competitive inhibitor. This type of inhibitor binds with equal affinity, $K_i$, to both the free enzyme $E$ and the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$. The resulting $ESI$ complex is non-productive. The velocity equation for non-competitive inhibition is:\n$$\nv([I];[S]) = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{ \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) ([S] + K_m) } = \\frac{v_0}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}\n$$\nUsing the definition $v(IC_{50};[S]) = \\frac{1}{2}v_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_0}{1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i}} = \\frac{1}{2}v_0\n$$\nCanceling $v_0$ gives:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{IC_{50}}{K_i} = 2\n$$\n$$\nIC_{50} = K_i\n$$\nThus, for a purely non-competitive inhibitor, $IC_{50}$ is a constant equal to $K_i$ and is independent of the substrate concentration $[S]$. This is because the inhibitor simply reduces the apparent $V_{max}$ without affecting substrate binding, so the fractional inhibition at a given $[I]$ is the same regardless of $[S]$.",

This increases $K_{m}^{\\text{app}} = K_m(1 + [I]/K_i)$ while $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = V_{\\max}$. The slope increases with $[I]$, but the y-intercept remains constant. The lines intersect at the y-axis.\n- **Uncompetitive Inhibition**: The inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex, $ES$. This decreases both $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = V_{\\max}/(1 + [I]/K_{i}')$ and $K_{m}^{\\text{app}} = K_m/(1 + [I]/K_{i}')$ by the same factor. The slope, $m = K_{m}^{\\text{app}}/V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = K_m/V_{\\max}$, is independent of $[I]$. The y-intercept, $b = 1/V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = (1 + [I]/K_{i}')/V_{\\max}$, increases linearly with $[I]$. Consequently, the LB plot shows a family of parallel lines for different $[I]$.\n- **Non-competitive/Mixed Inhibition**: The inhibitor binds to both $E$ and $ES$. Both $K_{m}^{\\text{app}}$ and $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}$ are affected, but not necessarily by the same factor. The slope and y-intercept both change with $[I]$, resulting in lines that intersect, but not on the y-axis (unless it is pure non-competitive, where they intersect on the x-axis).\n\nThe problem states that the fitted LB lines are observed to be parallel. This corresponds to a constant slope and a changing y-intercept. The provided data confirms this: the slope $m$ remains constant at $0.500~\\mathrm{s}$ for all inhibitor concentrations ($[I]=0, 10, 30~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), while the y-intercept $b$ increases with $[I]$ ($0.100$, $0.150$, $0.250~\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$). This distinct signature of a constant slope with an increasing intercept is characteristic exclusively of **uncompetitive inhibition**.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Rate Law for Uncompetitive Inhibition**\n\nThe reaction scheme for uncompetitive inhibition is given as:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{cat}}} E + P\n$$\n$$\nES + I \\underset{k_{-i'}}{\\stackrel{k_{i'}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ESI\n$$\nThe dissociation constant for the inhibitor is $K_{i}' = \\frac{k_{-i'}}{k_{i'}} = \\frac{[ES][I]}{[ESI]}$.\nThe initial rate of product formation is defined by the catalytic step:\n$$\nv = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]\n$$\nThe total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$ is conserved:\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + [ESI]\n$$\nUnder the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA), the rate of change of the intermediate concentrations is approximately zero. A common simplification within QSSA is to assume that the inhibitor binding and unbinding steps are much faster than the overall reaction, meaning the $ESI$ complex is in equilibrium with the $ES$ complex and inhibitor $I$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\n[ESI] = \\frac{[ES][I]}{K_{i}'}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the enzyme conservation equation:\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [ES] + \\frac{[ES][I]}{K_{i}'} = [E] + [ES]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we apply the QSSA to the $ES$ complex:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] = 0\n$$\nNote that the fast equilibrium of the inhibitor step means the forward and reverse rates ($k_{i'}[ES][I]$ and $k_{-i'}[ESI]$) cancel each other out in the net rate equation for $d[ES]/dt$.\nFrom the QSSA equation, we solve for the free enzyme concentration $[E]$:\n$$\nk_1[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] \\implies [E] = \\frac{(k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})}{k_1} \\frac{[ES]}{[S]}\n$$\nThe Michaelis constant is defined as $K_m = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})/k_1$. Therefore:\n$$\n[E] = \\frac{K_m}{[S]}[ES]\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[E]$ back into the enzyme conservation equation:\n$$\n[E]_T = \\frac{K_m}{[S]}[ES] + [ES]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}\\right) = [ES] \\left(\\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}\\right)\n$$\nSolve for $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T}{\\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}}\n$$\nThe reaction rate $v$ is then:\n$$\nv = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES] = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T}{\\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}}\n$$\nLet $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T$. Rearranging the expression to match the standard Michaelis-Menten form:\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}\\right)}\n$$\nTo make the dependence on apparent parameters explicit, we divide the numerator and denominator by $(1 + [I]/K_{i}')$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max}}{1 + [I]/K_{i}'} [S]}{\\frac{K_m}{1 + [I]/K_{i}'} + [S]}\n$$\nThis gives the rate law in terms of the apparent parameters $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}$ and $K_{m}^{\\text{app}}$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} [S]}{K_{m}^{\\text{app}} + [S]}\n$$\nwhere the apparent maximum rate is:\n$$\nV_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}}\n$$\nThis derivation explicitly shows the required dependence of $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}$ on $[I]$.\n\n**3. Parameter Estimation and Calculation**\n\nThe LB equation derived from our rate law is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{K_m + [S](1 + [I]/K_{i}')}{V_{\\max}[S]} = \\left(\\frac{K_m}{V_{\\max}}\\right)\\frac{1}{[S]} + \\frac{1 + [I]/K_{i}'}{V_{\\max}}\n$$\nThe LB slope is $m = K_m/V_{\\max}$ and the intercept is $b = (1/V_{\\max})(1 + [I]/K_{i}')$.\n\nFirst, we estimate $V_{\\max}$ at $[I]=0$. At $[I]=0$, the intercept equation simplifies to $b(0) = 1/V_{\\max}$.\nGiven $b(0) = 0.100~\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$.\n$$\nV_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{b(0)} = \\frac{1}{0.100~\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}} = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we estimate the uncompetitive inhibition constant $K_{i}'$. The y-intercept $b$ is a linear function of $[I]$:\n$$\nb([I]) = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} + \\frac{[I]}{V_{\\max}K_{i}'} = b(0) \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $K_{i}'$:\n$$\n\\frac{b([I])}{b(0)} - 1 = \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'} \\implies K_{i}' = \\frac{[I]}{\\frac{b([I])}{b(0)} - 1}\n$$\nUsing the data for $[I] = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $b(10) = 0.150~\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$:\n$$\nK_{i}' = \\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\frac{0.150}{0.100} - 1} = \\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.5 - 1} = \\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.5} = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nWe can verify this with the data for $[I] = 30~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $b(30) = 0.250~\\mathrm{s}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$:\n$$\nK_{i}' = \\frac{30~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{\\frac{0.250}{0.100} - 1} = \\frac{30~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2.5 - 1} = \\frac{30~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1.5} = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe values are consistent. Thus, $K_{i}' = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFinally, we compute $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}$ at $[I] = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ using the derived dependence.\n$$\nV_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}'}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values $V_{\\max} = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $K_{i}' = 20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and the specified $[I] = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$\nV_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}([I]=50) = \\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1 + \\frac{50~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{20~\\mu\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1 + 2.5} = \\frac{10}{3.5}~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = \\frac{10}{7/2}~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{20}{7}~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 2.85714~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we get $2.86~\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",
