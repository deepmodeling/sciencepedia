            "problem": "A single bacterial promoter controls transcription initiation by recruiting a single molecule of ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP). Assume a two-state equilibrium model in which the promoter is either unbound or bound by RNAP. Use a grand-canonical statistical mechanics description in which the RNAP chemical potential is constant and denoted by $\\mu$. The standard free energy of RNAP binding to the promoter is $\\Delta G_b$ (per mole), defined relative to the unbound promoter, and the temperature is $T$. Assume noncooperative binding and that equilibrium is established rapidly compared to the timescale of transcription initiation.\n\nStarting from first principles (Boltzmann weights for the two states in the grand-canonical ensemble), derive an expression for the fractional occupancy $p$ of the promoter by RNAP in terms of $\\beta$, $\\Delta G_b$, and $\\mu$, where $\\beta = 1/(R T)$ and $R$ is the molar gas constant.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a fold-change in biomolecular binding affinity, based on a statistical mechanical model. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, so we may proceed with the solution.\n\nWe are to model the binding of a single molecule of ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNAP) to a single promoter site. The system is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir of RNAP molecules at temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. This scenario is properly described by the grand-canonical ensemble. The promoter exists in one of $2$ states: unbound or bound by RNAP.\n\nLet us define the states and their statistical weights. We set the energy of the unbound promoter with no RNAP bound as the reference energy, $E_0=0$. The number of bound particles is $N_0=0$. The grand potential of a state with energy $E$ and $N$ particles is $\\Omega = E - TS - \\mu N$. However, for a two-state model in equilibrium, we may work with the change in free energy upon binding. The problem provides the standard molar free energy of binding, $\\Delta G_b$. We are also given $\\beta = 1/(RT)$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant. This formulation implies we should work with molar energies.\n\nLet's define the statistical weight of a state $i$ with $N_i$ bound particles and a change in free energy $\\Delta G_i$ relative to the reference state as $w_i = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_i - N_i \\mu))$.\n\nState 1: Unbound promoter.\nHere, $N_1=0$. We define this as our reference state, so the free energy change relative to itself is $\\Delta G_1=0$.\nThe statistical weight of the unbound state is:\n$$\nw_{\\text{unbound}} = \\exp(-\\beta(0 - 0 \\cdot \\mu)) = \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\n\nState 2: Promoter bound by one RNAP molecule.\nHere, $N_2=1$. The change in standard free energy for this process is given as $\\Delta G_b$.\nThe statistical weight of the bound state is:\n$$\nw_{\\text{bound}} = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - 1 \\cdot \\mu)) = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))\n$$\n\nThe grand-canonical partition function, $\\Xi$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states:\n$$\n\\Xi = w_{\\text{unbound}} + w_{\\text{bound}} = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))\n$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $p$, is the probability of finding the promoter in the bound state. This is the statistical weight of the bound state divided by the partition function.\n$$\np = \\frac{w_{\\text{bound}}}{\\Xi} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the fractional occupancy $p$ in terms of $\\beta$, $\\Delta G_b$, and $\\mu$.\n\nThe problem then asks for the fold-change in the bound-to-unbound odds. The odds of binding are defined as the ratio of the probability of being bound to the probability of being unbound, $O = p/(1-p)$.\nFirst, we find an expression for $1-p$:\n$$\n1-p = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))} = \\frac{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu)) - \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}\n$$\nNow we compute the odds, $O$:\n$$\nO = \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}}{\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))}} = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_b - \\mu))\n$$\nThe problem specifies two cases: a wild-type (WT) promoter and a mutant (mut) promoter. Let the binding free energy for the wild-type be $\\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}}$ and for the mutant be $\\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}}$. The temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ are the same for both.\n\nThe odds for the wild-type promoter are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{WT}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)_{\\text{WT}} = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}} - \\mu))\n$$\nThe odds for the mutant promoter are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{mut}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)_{\\text{mut}} = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}} - \\mu))\n$$\nThe required fold-change is the ratio of these odds:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{O_{\\text{mut}}}{O_{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}} - \\mu))}{\\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}} - \\mu))} = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}} - \\mu) + \\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}} - \\mu))\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}}))\n$$\nLet us define the change in binding free energy due to the mutation as $\\Delta\\Delta G_b = \\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}} - \\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta\\Delta G_b)\n$$\nNotice this result is independent of the chemical potential $\\mu$. Although the problem specified $\\mu=0$, this was not necessary for the calculation of the fold-change.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided.\nThe gas constant is $R = 0.0019872041\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$.\nThe temperature is $T = 300\\,\\text{K}$.\nThus, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{RT} = \\frac{1}{(0.0019872041\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(300\\,\\text{K})} = \\frac{1}{0.59616123\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 1.677354\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{kcal}^{-1}$.\n\nThe binding free energy for the wild-type is $\\Delta G_{b, \\text{WT}} = -8\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\nThe mutation weakens binding by $2\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$, so the free energy change is $\\Delta\\Delta G_b = +2\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$. (The binding free energy becomes less negative: $\\Delta G_{b, \\text{mut}} = -8 + 2 = -6\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$).\n\nWe compute the argument of the exponential:\n$$\n-\\beta \\Delta\\Delta G_b = -(1.677354\\,\\text{mol}\\,\\text{kcal}^{-1}) \\times (2\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}) = -3.354708\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the fold-change:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\exp(-3.354708) \\approx 0.03491905\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as required, we obtain $0.03492$.\nThe weakening of binding affinity by $2\\,\\text{kcal}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$ results in a significant reduction in the odds of the promoter being occupied by RNAP.",

It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantitative biology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the mRNA molecule count, $m(t)$, are governed by a conservation law. The rate of change of $m(t)$ is the difference between the rate of production (transcription) and the rate of removal (degradation and dilution).\nBased on mass-action kinetics, this is formulated as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = \\text{rate of production} - \\text{rate of removal}\n$$\nThe rate of production is the transcription rate, which is a function of time, $r(t)$. The rate of removal is a first-order process, proportional to the current number of mRNA molecules, with a rate constant $\\delta$.\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = r(t) - \\delta m(t)\n$$\nFirst, we must determine the initial condition, $m(0)$. The problem states that for $t < 0$, the system is in a pre-induction steady state with a constant transcription rate $r_0$. At steady state, the number of molecules is constant, so $\\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\n0 = r_0 - \\delta m_{ss,0}\n$$\nwhere $m_{ss,0}$ is the pre-induction steady-state number of molecules. Solving for $m_{ss,0}$ gives:\n$$\nm_{ss,0} = \\frac{r_0}{\\delta}\n$$\nThis is our initial condition: $m(0) = m_{ss,0} = \\frac{r_0}{\\delta}$.\n\nFor $t \\geq 0$, the transcription rate is instantaneously increased to $r_1$. The governing differential equation for $t \\geq 0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = r_1 - \\delta m(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} + \\delta m(t) = r_1\n$$\nThe general solution can be found using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\delta \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(\\delta t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\delta t) \\frac{dm(t)}{dt} + \\delta \\exp(\\delta t) m(t) = r_1 \\exp(\\delta t)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $m(t) \\exp(\\delta t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ m(t) \\exp(\\delta t) \\right] = r_1 \\exp(\\delta t)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\nm(t) \\exp(\\delta t) = \\int r_1 \\exp(\\delta t) \\, dt = \\frac{r_1}{\\delta} \\exp(\\delta t) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the expected number of base substitutions that become fixed in a genome after one cycle of replication. This quantity is determined by the interplay of error introduction by DNA polymerase and subsequent correction by two major repair systems: proofreading and mismatch repair. The foundation of the solution lies in probability theory, specifically the calculation of the probability of a sequence of dependent events, and the application of the linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of nucleotide positions in the genome, which is given as $N = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$.\nA base substitution becomes a fixed mutation at a single position if and only if a sequence of three events occurs: an initial misincorporation, a failure of proofreading, and a subsequent failure of mismatch repair. We must calculate the probability of this compound event.\n\nLet us define the events for a single nucleotide position:\n- $M$: The event that DNA polymerase misincorporates a nucleotide. The probability is given as $P(M) = \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$.\n- $F_P$: The event that the exonuclease proofreading mechanism fails to correct the mismatch. This is a conditional event, dependent on the occurrence of a misincorporation. The problem provides the conditional probability $P(F_P | M) = \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$.\n- $F_{MMR}$: The event that the mismatch repair (MMR) system fails to correct the mismatch. This event is conditional on a mismatch having persisted through both replication and proofreading, i.e., conditional on the event $M \\cap F_P$. The problem provides the conditional probability $P(F_{MMR} | M \\cap F_P) = \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$.\n\nThe probability of a single fixed substitution, which we denote as $\\mu$, is the probability of the intersection of these three events: $\\mu = P(M \\cap F_P \\cap F_{MMR})$. Using the chain rule for probabilities, we can express $\\mu$ as follows:\n$$ \\mu = P(M) \\times P(F_P | M) \\times P(F_{MMR} | M \\cap F_P) $$\nThe problem statement provides all the necessary probabilities on the right-hand side. Substituting the given symbolic parameters:\n$$ \\mu = \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} $$\nThis expression represents the probability of a fixed mutation arising at any single nucleotide position during one cell division.\n\nNow, we must find the expected total number of such mutations across the entire genome of $N$ positions. Let $X$ be a random variable representing the total number of substitutions per cell division. We can define $N$ indicator random variables, $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N$, where $X_i = 1$ if a fixed substitution occurs at position $i$, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The probability that $X_i = 1$ is precisely $\\mu$, as calculated above.\nThe total number of substitutions is the sum of these indicator variables: $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$ E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] $$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable $X_i$ is equal to the probability of the event it indicates: $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = \\mu$.\nSince the probability of mutation $\\mu$ is assumed to be identical for all positions, the sum simplifies to:\n$$ E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mu = N \\cdot \\mu $$\nThus, the final expression for the expected number of substitutions is:\n$$ E[X] = N \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} $$\nWe now proceed to the numerical evaluation using the given parameter values:\n$N = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{pol}} = 10^{-5}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{proof}} = 10^{-2}$\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{MMR}} = 10^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the single-site mutation probability, $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu = (10^{-5}) \\times (10^{-2}) \\times (10^{-1}) = 10^{-5-2-1} = 10^{-8} $$\nThis is the per-site, per-replication mutation rate.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected total number of substitutions, $E[X]$:\n$$ E[X] = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (10^{-8}) = 3.2 \\times 10^{9-8} = 3.2 \\times 10^{1} = 32 $$\nThe expected number of replication-induced base substitutions per cell division is therefore $32$.\n\nFinally, we assess the biological plausibility of this result. The calculated overall mutation rate of $\\mu = 10^{-8}$ mutations per base pair per replication cycle is a textbook value, highly consistent with measurements of the germline mutation rate in humans and other mammals. The resulting expectation of $32$ new mutations for a genome of size $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs is also well within the range of established biological estimates. Empirical studies of *de novo* mutations in humans, which accumulate over cell divisions, report tens of new mutations per generation. An expectation of $32$ mutations arising from a single round of replication of the genome is therefore a scientifically sound and plausible magnitude. It correctly quantifies the outcome of a process where an immense number of nucleotides are copied with extraordinarily high, yet imperfect, fidelity. The Central Dogma's tenet of information preservation from DNA to DNA is maintained with high fidelity, but this calculation demonstrates that it is not absolute.",
