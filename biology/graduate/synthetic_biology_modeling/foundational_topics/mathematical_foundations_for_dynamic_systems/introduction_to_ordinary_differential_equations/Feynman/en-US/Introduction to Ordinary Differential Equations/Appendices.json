This exercise demonstrates how to translate a simple biological scenario—constant production and first-order decay of a molecule—into a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

            "problem": "In the field of synthetic biology, engineers design and construct novel biological circuits. Consider one of the simplest such circuits, a \"constitutive gene expression\" module, implemented in a bacterium. In this module, a specific gene is continuously transcribed into messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) at a constant rate, denoted by $k$. Simultaneously, the mRNA molecules are actively degraded by enzymes within the cell. This degradation process is modeled as a first-order reaction, meaning the rate of decay is directly proportional to the current concentration of the mRNA, $m(t)$. The proportionality constant for this degradation is $\\gamma$. The net rate of change of the mRNA concentration over time is thus governed by the differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = k - \\gamma m(t)\n$$\n\nAssuming $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants, determine the general solution for the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$. Your answer should be an expression in terms of $k$, $\\gamma$, $t$, and a constant of integration, $C$.",

            "introduction": "Biological systems are inherently non-linear, often relying on feedback mechanisms for regulation. This practice introduces non-linearity by modeling a common synthetic biology motif: negative autorepression, where a protein inhibits its own production. Instead of seeking a full time-dependent solution, this problem focuses on a powerful analytical technique: finding the system's steady-state concentration. Mastering steady-state analysis is crucial for predicting the long-term behavior of complex gene circuits without needing to solve the full differential equations. ",

            "problem": "In a synthetic gene circuit designed within a bacterium, a specific protein acts as a repressor for its own synthesis. This is a common negative feedback motif called autorepression. The concentration of this protein, denoted by $P$, evolves over time according to the following ordinary differential equation, which represents a simplified model of the system's dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\nIn this model, the term $\\frac{k}{1+P}$ describes the rate of protein production, which is repressed as the concentration $P$ increases. The term $-\\gamma P$ represents the first-order degradation and dilution of the protein. The parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants representing the maximum production rate and the degradation/dilution rate constant, respectively.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a stable configuration over time, find the symbolic expression for the physically meaningful (i.e., positive) steady-state concentration of the protein, $P_{ss}$, in terms of the parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$.",
            "solution": "The steady-state concentration of the protein, $P_{ss}$, is the concentration at which the rate of change of $P$ with respect to time is zero. Therefore, we must set $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$.\n\nStarting with the given differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\n\nAt steady state, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}} - \\gamma P_{ss}\n$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this algebraic equation for $P_{ss}$. We can rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}}\n$$\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by $(1+P_{ss})$ to clear the denominator. This is valid since protein concentration $P_{ss}$ must be non-negative, so $1+P_{ss}$ is strictly positive.\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} (1+P_{ss}) = k\n$$\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation gives:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} + \\gamma P_{ss}^2 = k\n$$\n\nTo solve for $P_{ss}$, we can arrange this into the standard form of a quadratic equation, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where our variable is $x = P_{ss}$:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss}^2 + \\gamma P_{ss} - k = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for $P_{ss}$ using the quadratic formula, $P_{ss} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a = \\gamma$, $b = \\gamma$, and $c = -k$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients into the quadratic formula:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{(\\gamma)^2 - 4(\\gamma)(-k)}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for the steady-state concentration:\n1.  $P_{ss,1} = \\frac{-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}$\n2.  $P_{ss,2} = \\frac{-\\gamma - \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}$\n\nWe must choose the physically meaningful solution. Since protein concentration $P$ cannot be negative, we need to determine the sign of each solution. The parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ are given as positive constants.\n\nFor the second solution, $P_{ss,2}$, the numerator is the sum of two negative terms ($-\\gamma$ and $-\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}$), so it is clearly negative. The denominator $2\\gamma$ is positive. Thus, $P_{ss,2}$ is a negative value, which is not physically possible.\n\nFor the first solution, $P_{ss,1}$, let's analyze the term under the square root. Since $k  0$ and $\\gamma  0$, the term $4\\gamma k$ is positive. Therefore, $\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k  \\gamma^2$, and taking the square root gives $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}  \\sqrt{\\gamma^2} = \\gamma$. This means the numerator, $-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}$, is a positive value. Since the denominator $2\\gamma$ is also positive, $P_{ss,1}$ is positive.\n\nTherefore, the only physically meaningful steady-state concentration is:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n\nThis expression can be further simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $\\gamma$:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{\\gamma}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}{\\gamma^2}}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4k}{\\gamma}}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the positive steady-state protein concentration.",

In this context, the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is of the form $x'(t) = f(x(t))$, where $x'(t)$ denotes the time derivative of $x(t)$, and $f$ is a sufficiently smooth function representing net production and degradation. The degradation-only case is $x'(t) = -\\lambda x(t)$ with $\\lambda  0$, where $\\lambda$ is the decay rate measured in $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ (per hour). The synthesis-and-degradation model is $x'(t) = k - \\lambda x(t)$ with constant synthesis rate $k$ measured in concentration per hour and decay rate $\\lambda$ measured in $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. Use the definition of the derivative and smoothness assumptions to construct a first-order explicit time-stepping algorithm for approximating $x(t+h)$ from $x(t)$ over a small time increment $h  0$, without using any pre-given update formulas.\n\nStarting from a valid mathematical base, specifically the definition of the derivative $x'(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x(t+h) - x(t)}{h}$, smoothness of $x(t)$, and Taylor expansion at $t$, derive the leading-order expression for the one-step Local Truncation Error (LTE), defined as the error incurred in one step when the current value equals the exact solution at that step. Show that, for smooth $f$, the LTE scales like $O(h^2)$, and explicitly express the leading-order coefficient in terms of $f$ and its derivatives evaluated at the current state. Use only well-tested facts, such as chain rule and Taylor series, as your base. Do not use or assume any step-update formulas; derive them.\n\nThen, analyze and state the stability constraint of the derived explicit method when applied to the decay model $x'(t) = -\\lambda x(t)$ with $\\lambda  0$. Stability here means that the numerical solution magnitude decays monotonically to zero for large iteration counts, consistent with the continuous dynamics.

Treat the boundary case exactly at the extremal value as not stable under the monotonic decay definition.\n\nTest suite (each item is independent, and the program must output a result for each item in order):\n\n1.

            "solution": "We begin from the definition of the derivative and the smoothness of the solution.

This rule is known as the forward (explicit) Euler method, derived directly from the derivative definition and the Taylor series without assuming it a priori.\n\nTo quantify the error incurred in one step when starting from the exact value $x(t)$, define the one-step Local Truncation Error (LTE) as\n$$\n\\mathrm{LTE}(h; t) = x(t+h) - \\left[x(t) + h f(x(t))\\right].\n$$\nUsing the Taylor expansion, we have\n$$\n\\mathrm{LTE}(h; t) = \\frac{h^2}{2} x''(t) + O(h^3).\n$$\nTherefore, the LTE scales like $O(h^2)$, and the leading-order coefficient is $\\frac{1}{2} x''(t)$.
