            "problem": "In a synthetic biology experiment, a strain of *Escherichia coli* is engineered to produce a fluorescent protein. The production of this protein is initiated at time $t=0$ and is characterized by a constant production rate, $\\alpha$, which represents the amount of protein synthesized per unit volume per unit time. The protein concentration, denoted by $P(t)$, is reduced by two distinct first-order processes running in parallel. The first is active enzymatic degradation, with a rate constant $\\gamma$. The second is an effective dilution of the protein concentration due to the rapid, exponential growth of the bacterial culture. This growth is characterized by a specific growth rate $\\mu$. The dilution effect can also be modeled as a first-order loss term with an effective rate constant equal to the growth rate $\\mu$.\n\nAssuming that the initial concentration of the fluorescent protein at time $t=0$ is zero, determine the concentration of the protein, $P(t)$, as a function of time $t$ and the parameters $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$, and $\\mu$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the concentration of a protein, $P(t)$, over time. We can model the dynamics of $P(t)$ by setting up an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that accounts for all the processes affecting its concentration. The rate of change of the protein concentration, $\\frac{dP}{dt}$, is the sum of the rates of production and removal.\n\nFirst, let's identify the individual rate terms based on the problem description:\n1.  **Production:** The protein is produced at a constant rate $\\alpha$. This contributes a positive term to $\\frac{dP}{dt}$.\n    Rate of production = $+\\alpha$.\n2.  **Degradation:** The protein is actively degraded through a first-order process with a rate constant $\\gamma$. This means the rate of degradation is proportional to the current concentration $P(t)$.\n    Rate of degradation = $-\\gamma P(t)$.\n3.  **Dilution:** The protein concentration is diluted due to cell growth. This is also a first-order process, where the effective rate constant is the specific growth rate $\\mu$. The rate of loss due to dilution is proportional to the current concentration $P(t)$.\n    Rate of dilution = $-\\mu P(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, we can write the full differential equation for the protein concentration $P(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\alpha - \\gamma P(t) - \\mu P(t)\n$$\nWe can factor out $P(t)$ from the removal terms:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\alpha - (\\gamma + \\mu) P(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} + (\\gamma + \\mu) P(t) = \\alpha\n$$\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor, $I(t)$, is given by $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int (\\gamma + \\mu) dt\\right)$. Since $\\gamma$ and $\\mu$ are constants, the integral is straightforward:\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)\n$$\nNow, we multiply the entire ODE by the integrating factor $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) \\frac{dP}{dt} + \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)(\\gamma + \\mu) P(t) = \\alpha \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)\n$$\nThe left side of the equation is now the result of the product rule for differentiation, specifically $\\frac{d}{dt}[P(t)I(t)]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[ P(t) \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) \\right] = \\alpha \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)\n$$\nTo find $P(t)$, we integrate both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[ P(t) \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) \\right] dt = \\int \\alpha \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) dt\n$$\n$$\nP(t) \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\nTo determine the value of $C$, we apply the initial condition given in the problem: $P(0) = 0$. We substitute $t=0$ and $P(0)=0$ into the general solution:\n$$\n0 \\cdot \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu) \\cdot 0\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu) \\cdot 0\\right) + C\n$$\n$$\n0 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\cdot 1 + C\n$$\n$$\nC = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu}\n$$\nNow we substitute this value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$\nP(t) \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu}\n$$\nFinally, to solve for $P(t)$, we divide the entire equation by the integrating factor $\\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)$, which is equivalent to multiplying by $\\exp\\left(-(\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)$:\n$$\nP(t) = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\exp\\left((\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\right) \\exp\\left(-(\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\exp\\left(-(\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu}$ gives the final expression for the protein concentration as a function of time:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(\\gamma + \\mu)t\\right)\\right)\n$$",

            "problem": "In a synthetic gene circuit designed within a bacterium, a specific protein acts as a repressor for its own synthesis. This is a common negative feedback motif called autorepression. The concentration of this protein, denoted by $P$, evolves over time according to the following ordinary differential equation, which represents a simplified model of the system's dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\nIn this model, the term $\\frac{k}{1+P}$ describes the rate of protein production, which is repressed as the concentration $P$ increases. The term $-\\gamma P$ represents the first-order degradation and dilution of the protein. The parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants representing the maximum production rate and the degradation/dilution rate constant, respectively.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a stable configuration over time, find the symbolic expression for the physically meaningful (i.e., positive) steady-state concentration of the protein, $P_{ss}$, in terms of the parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$.",
            "solution": "The steady-state concentration of the protein, $P_{ss}$, is the concentration at which the rate of change of $P$ with respect to time is zero. Therefore, we must set $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$.\n\nStarting with the given differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\n\nAt steady state, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}} - \\gamma P_{ss}\n$$\n\nOur goal is to solve this algebraic equation for $P_{ss}$. We can rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}}\n$$\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by $(1+P_{ss})$ to clear the denominator. This is valid since protein concentration $P_{ss}$ must be non-negative, so $1+P_{ss}$ is strictly positive.\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} (1+P_{ss}) = k\n$$\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation gives:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} + \\gamma P_{ss}^2 = k\n$$\n\nTo solve for $P_{ss}$, we can arrange this into the standard form of a quadratic equation, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where our variable is $x = P_{ss}$:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss}^2 + \\gamma P_{ss} - k = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for $P_{ss}$ using the quadratic formula, $P_{ss} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a = \\gamma$, $b = \\gamma$, and $c = -k$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients into the quadratic formula:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{(\\gamma)^2 - 4(\\gamma)(-k)}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for the steady-state concentration:\n1.  $P_{ss,1} = \\frac{-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}$\n2.  $P_{ss,2} = \\frac{-\\gamma - \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}$\n\nWe must choose the physically meaningful solution. Since protein concentration $P$ cannot be negative, we need to determine the sign of each solution. The parameters $k$ and $\\gamma$ are given as positive constants.\n\nFor the second solution, $P_{ss,2}$, the numerator is the sum of two negative terms ($-\\gamma$ and $-\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}$), so it is clearly negative. The denominator $2\\gamma$ is positive. Thus, $P_{ss,2}$ is a negative value, which is not physically possible.\n\nFor the first solution, $P_{ss,1}$, let's analyze the term under the square root. Since $k > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the term $4\\gamma k$ is positive. Therefore, $\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k > \\gamma^2$, and taking the square root gives $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k} > \\sqrt{\\gamma^2} = \\gamma$. This means the numerator, $-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}$, is a positive value. Since the denominator $2\\gamma$ is also positive, $P_{ss,1}$ is positive.\n\nTherefore, the only physically meaningful steady-state concentration is:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{2\\gamma}\n$$\n\nThis expression can be further simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $\\gamma$:\n$$\nP_{ss} = \\frac{-1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}}{\\gamma}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k}{\\gamma^2}}}{2} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4k}{\\gamma}}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the positive steady-state protein concentration.",

In this context, the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is of the form $x'(t) = f(x(t))$, where $x'(t)$ denotes the time derivative of $x(t)$, and $f$ is a sufficiently smooth function representing net production and degradation. The degradation-only case is $x'(t) = -\\lambda x(t)$ with $\\lambda  0$, where $\\lambda$ is the decay rate measured in $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ (per hour).
