The system is assumed to be isothermal and well-mixed, with reactions obeying the law of mass action. Let $s(t)$, $e(t)$, $c(t)$, and $p(t)$ denote the concentrations of $S$, $E$, $C$, and $P$ at time $t$, respectively. The forward association rate constant is $k_{1}$, the dissociation rate constant is $k_{-1}$, and the catalytic turnover rate constant is $k_{2}$. The total enzyme concentration is conserved, $e_{0} = e(t) + c(t)$. Initial conditions are $s(0) = s_{0}$, $e(0) = e_{0}$, $c(0) = 0$, and $p(0) = 0$. \n\nStarting from the law of mass action and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and invoking the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for the complex $C$ together with enzyme conservation, derive the leading-order initial rate law for product formation $v_{0} = \\left.\\dfrac{dp}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}$ as an explicit function of the free substrate $s$ and parameters.

According to the law of mass action, the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the time evolution of the concentrations is:\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} = -k_1 e(t)s(t) + k_{-1}c(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{de}{dt} = -k_1 e(t)s(t) + (k_{-1} + k_2)c(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = k_1 e(t)s(t) - (k_{-1} + k_2)c(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = k_2 c(t) $$\n\nThe total enzyme concentration, $e_0$, is conserved. This provides an algebraic constraint:\n$$ e_0 = e(t) + c(t) $$\nWe can express the free enzyme concentration $e(t)$ as $e(t) = e_0 - c(t)$. Substituting this into the ODE for the complex $C$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = k_1 (e_0 - c(t))s(t) - (k_{-1} + k_2)c(t) $$\n\nThe problem instructs to invoke the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for the complex $C$. This approximation assumes that the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $C$ changes much more slowly than the concentrations of substrate and product, and thus its rate of change can be set to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nApplying this approximation to the ODE for $c(t)$:\n$$ k_1 (e_0 - c(t))s(t) - (k_{-1} + k_2)c(t) \\approx 0 $$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for the quasi-steady-state concentration of the complex, which we denote as $c_{qss}$.

Substituting the expression for $c$:\n$$ v = k_2 \\frac{e_0 s}{s + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}} $$\nThis equation is the Michaelis-Menten rate law. The standard form of this law is:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{max} s}{K_M + s} $$\nBy comparing our derived expression with the standard form, we can identify the maximal velocity $V_{max}$ and the Michaelis constant $K_M$.\nThe maximal velocity $V_{max}$ is the rate when the enzyme is saturated with substrate (i.e., as $s \\rightarrow \\infty$, $c \\rightarrow e_0$, so $v \\rightarrow k_2 e_0$).\n$$ V_{max} = k_2 e_0 $$\nThe Michaelis constant $K_M$ is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{max}$. From our derived equation, this corresponds to:\n$$ K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} $$\nThe initial rate of product formation, $v_0$, is the rate at $t=0$, where the substrate concentration is $s(0) = s_0$.
