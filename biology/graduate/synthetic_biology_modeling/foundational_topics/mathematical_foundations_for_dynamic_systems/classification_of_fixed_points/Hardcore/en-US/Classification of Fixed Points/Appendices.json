This first exercise  examines a pre-linearized two-dimensional system, allowing us to focus directly on how eigenvalues dictate a system's return to a stable equilibrium.

Finally, quantify the anisotropy of contraction by reporting, as a single dimensionless number, the ratio of the contraction rate along the faster principal axis to that along the slower principal axis. Provide the ratio in exact form (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The foundational setup for local stability analysis in biomedical systems modeling begins with the dynamical system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbf{f}$ is assumed sufficiently smooth. A fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$ satisfies $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{0}$. Linearization around $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$ introduces the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J} = D\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast})$, yielding the linearized system $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} = \\mathbf{J}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ for the deviation $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$. The classification of the fixed point in two dimensions follows from the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$: \n- If both eigenvalues are real and negative, the fixed point is a stable node.\n- If eigenvalues are real and of opposite signs, the fixed point is a saddle.\n- If eigenvalues are complex with nonzero imaginary parts, the fixed point is a spiral (stable if the real part is negative, unstable if positive).\n\nIn the present system, the equilibrium is at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, and the linear dynamics are given by\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{J}\\,\\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$ are obtained by solving $\\det(\\mathbf{J} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\!\\begin{pmatrix} -3 - \\lambda  0 \\\\ 0  -1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-3 - \\lambda)(-1 - \\lambda) = 0,\n$$\nso the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = -3$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -1$, both real and negative. The corresponding eigenvectors are aligned with the coordinate axes because $\\mathbf{J}$ is diagonal: $\\mathbf{v}_{1} = (1,0)^{\\top}$ for $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{2} = (0,1)^{\\top}$ for $\\lambda_{2}$. By the classification rules, the fixed point at the origin is a stable node (also called an asymptotically stable node), since both eigenvalues have negative real parts and are real.\n\nTo describe the geometry of contraction, consider the explicit solution of the linear system. Because $\\mathbf{J}$ is diagonal, the system decouples into\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = -3\\,x_{1}, \\qquad \\dot{x}_{2} = -1\\,x_{2}.\n$$\nThe solutions are\n$$\nx_{1}(t) = x_{1}(0)\\,\\exp(-3 t), \\qquad x_{2}(t) = x_{2}(0)\\,\\exp(-t).\n$$\nThus, trajectories contract exponentially along each coordinate axis, with an invariant subspace for each axis. Along the $x_{1}$-axis, contraction occurs with rate constant $3$, and along the $x_{2}$-axis, contraction occurs with rate constant $1$. The phase portrait exhibits anisotropic convergence: all trajectories approach the origin within the stable subspace $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, but the component along $x_{1}$ decays more rapidly than the component along $x_{2}$. Consequently, generic trajectories become increasingly aligned with the slower decaying axis (the $x_{2}$-axis) as $t \\to \\infty$, a typical feature of nodes with distinct real eigenvalues.\n\nFinally, to quantify the anisotropy of contraction, we define the ratio of the contraction rate along the faster principal axis to that along the slower principal axis. The faster contraction is governed by the larger magnitude eigenvalue $|\\lambda_{1}| = 3$, and the slower by $|\\lambda_{2}| = 1$. Therefore, the ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{3}{1} = 3.\n$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless and expresses that contraction along the $x_{1}$ axis is three times faster than along the $x_{2}$ axis in this biomedical linearized model.",
