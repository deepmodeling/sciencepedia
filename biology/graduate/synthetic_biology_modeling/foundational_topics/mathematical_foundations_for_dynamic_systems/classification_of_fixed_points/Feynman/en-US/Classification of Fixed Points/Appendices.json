This exercise  provides a clear illustration of how the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, $J$, directly correspond to the rates of relaxation back to equilibrium along principal directions. By examining this simplified, decoupled system, you will solidify your understanding of what defines a stable node and how to quantify the geometry of convergence.",

            "problem": "A two-dimensional linearized model of coupled biochemical regulation near a homeostatic equilibrium is given by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{J}\\,\\mathbf{x}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2})^{\\top}$ denotes deviations of two normalized concentrations from their steady-state values, and $\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium. In the context of biomedical systems modeling, use fundamental definitions of fixed points and linearization to determine the classification of the equilibrium at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$ (choose among node, saddle, or spiral), and explain the geometry of contraction along each coordinate axis in terms of the dynamical behavior of the system. Finally, quantify the anisotropy of contraction by reporting, as a single dimensionless number, the ratio of the contraction rate along the faster principal axis to that along the slower principal axis. Provide the ratio in exact form (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The foundational setup for local stability analysis in biomedical systems modeling begins with the dynamical system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbf{f}$ is assumed sufficiently smooth. A fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$ satisfies $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{0}$. Linearization around $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$ introduces the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J} = D\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast})$, yielding the linearized system $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} = \\mathbf{J}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ for the deviation $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}$. The classification of the fixed point in two dimensions follows from the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$: \n- If both eigenvalues are real and negative, the fixed point is a stable node.\n- If eigenvalues are real and of opposite signs, the fixed point is a saddle.\n- If eigenvalues are complex with nonzero imaginary parts, the fixed point is a spiral (stable if the real part is negative, unstable if positive).\n\nIn the present system, the equilibrium is at $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, and the linear dynamics are given by\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{J}\\,\\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$ are obtained by solving $\\det(\\mathbf{J} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$. Since the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_{1} = -3$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -1$.\nBoth eigenvalues are real and negative. By the classification rules, the fixed point at the origin is a **stable node**.\n\nTo describe the geometry of contraction, consider the explicit solution of the linear system. Because $\\mathbf{J}$ is diagonal, the system decouples into\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = -3\\,x_{1}, \\qquad \\dot{x}_{2} = -1\\,x_{2}.\n$$\nThe solutions are\n$$\nx_{1}(t) = x_{1}(0)\\,\\exp(-3 t), \\qquad x_{2}(t) = x_{2}(0)\\,\\exp(-t).\n$$\nThus, trajectories contract exponentially along each coordinate axis. Along the $x_{1}$-axis, contraction occurs with rate constant $3$, and along the $x_{2}$-axis, contraction occurs with rate constant $1$. The phase portrait exhibits anisotropic convergence: all trajectories approach the origin, but the component along $x_{1}$ decays more rapidly than the component along $x_{2}$. Consequently, generic trajectories become increasingly aligned with the slower decaying axis (the $x_{2}$-axis) as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nFinally, to quantify the anisotropy of contraction, we take the ratio of the contraction rate along the faster principal axis to that along the slower principal axis. The faster contraction is governed by the eigenvalue with the larger magnitude, $|\\lambda_{1}| = 3$, and the slower by $|\\lambda_{2}| = 1$. Therefore, the ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{|\\lambda_1|}{|\\lambda_2|} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3.\n$$\nThis dimensionless ratio indicates that contraction along the $x_{1}$ axis is three times faster than along the $x_{2}$ axis.",
