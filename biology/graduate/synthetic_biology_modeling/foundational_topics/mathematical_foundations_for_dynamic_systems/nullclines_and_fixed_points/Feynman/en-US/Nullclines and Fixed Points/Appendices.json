            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard models of systems biology, mathematically well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive the requested entities and construct the required proof.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = k_x - \\gamma_x x\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = k_y - \\gamma_y y\n$$\nwhere $x, y$ are concentrations, and the parameters $k_x, k_y, \\gamma_x, \\gamma_y$ are all positive real numbers. The state space is $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we address the uniqueness of solutions. The vector field for the system is $\\mathbf{F}(x,y) = (k_x - \\gamma_x x, k_y - \\gamma_y y)$. For any two points $\\mathbf{z}_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $\\mathbf{z}_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we have:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{z}_1) - \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{z}_2)\\|_2 = \\|(-\\gamma_x(x_1-x_2), -\\gamma_y(y_1-y_2))\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\gamma_x^2 (x_1-x_2)^2 + \\gamma_y^2 (y_1-y_2)^2}\n$$\nLet $M = \\max(\\gamma_x, \\gamma_y)$. Then,\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\gamma_x^2 (x_1-x_2)^2 + \\gamma_y^2 (y_1-y_2)^2} \\le \\sqrt{M^2 (x_1-x_2)^2 + M^2 (y_1-y_2)^2} = M \\|\\mathbf{z}_1 - \\mathbf{z}_2\\|_2\n$$\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ is globally Lipschitz continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with Lipschitz constant $M$. By the global version of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem, for any initial condition $(x(0), y(0)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, a unique solution exists for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe nullclines are the loci of points where the rate of change of one of the variables is zero.\nThe $x$-nullcline is defined by the condition $\\dot{x} = 0$. Setting the first equation to zero gives:\n$$\nk_x - \\gamma_x x = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{k_x}{\\gamma_x}\n$$\nThis is a vertical line in the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe $y$-nullcline is defined by the condition $\\dot{y} = 0$. Setting the second equation to zero gives:\n$$\nk_y - \\gamma_y y = 0 \\implies y = \\frac{k_y}{\\gamma_y}\n$$\nThis is a horizontal line in the $xy$-plane.\n\nA fixed point, denoted $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$, is a point where the system is in equilibrium, meaning $\\dot{x} = 0$ and $\\dot{y} = 0$ simultaneously. The fixed point is therefore the intersection of the $x$-nullcline and the $y$-nullcline. Solving the system of algebraic equations:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_x}{\\gamma_x}\n$$\n$$\ny^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_y}{\\gamma_y}\n$$\nSince $k_x, k_y, \\gamma_x, \\gamma_y$ are all positive constants, there is a unique fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{k_x}{\\gamma_x}, \\frac{k_y}{\\gamma_y}\\right)$.\n\nTo prove that this fixed point is globally asymptotically stable, we construct a Lyapunov function $L(x,y)$ and analyze its time derivative $\\dot{L}$ along the trajectories of the system. Let us define a candidate Lyapunov function centered at the fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nL(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x - x^{\\ast})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(y - y^{\\ast})^2\n$$\nThis function satisfies the necessary properties for a Lyapunov function candidate:\n$1$. $L(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = 0$.\n$2$. $L(x,y) > 0$ for all $(x,y) \\neq (x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$. Thus, $L$ is positive definite.\n$3$. $L(x,y) \\to \\infty$ as $\\|(x,y)\\| \\to \\infty$. Thus, $L$ is radially unbounded, which is required for proving global stability.\n\nNow, we compute the time derivative of $L(x,y)$ along the system's trajectories:\n$$\n\\dot{L} = \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}\\dot{x} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y}\\dot{y}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $L$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = x - x^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = y - y^{\\ast}\n$$\nSubstituting these and the expressions for $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$ into the equation for $\\dot{L}$:\n$$\n\\dot{L} = (x - x^{\\ast})(k_x - \\gamma_x x) + (y - y^{\\ast})(k_y - \\gamma_y y)\n$$\nFrom the definition of the fixed point, we have $k_x = \\gamma_x x^{\\ast}$ and $k_y = \\gamma_y y^{\\ast}$. Substituting these into the expression for $\\dot{L}$:\n$$\n\\dot{L} = (x - x^{\\ast})(\\gamma_x x^{\\ast} - \\gamma_x x) + (y - y^{\\ast})(\\gamma_y y^{\\ast} - \\gamma_y y)\n$$\nFactoring out $-\\gamma_x$ and $-\\gamma_y$:\n$$\n\\dot{L} = -\\gamma_x (x - x^{\\ast})^2 - \\gamma_y (y - y^{\\ast})^2\n$$\nSince the parameters $\\gamma_x$ and $\\gamma_y$ are strictly positive, the terms $(x - x^{\\ast})^2$ and $(y - y^{\\ast})^2$ are non-negative.\nTherefore, $\\dot{L} \\leq 0$ for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, $\\dot{L} = 0$ if and only if both $-\\gamma_x (x - x^{\\ast})^2 = 0$ and $-\\gamma_y (y - y^{\\ast})^2 = 0$. This occurs only when $x = x^{\\ast}$ and $y = y^{\\ast}$. Thus, $\\dot{L}$ is negative definite, as it is strictly negative for all $(x,y) \\neq (x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ and zero only at the fixed point.\n\nAccording to the Lyapunov stability theorem, since we have found a positive definite, radially unbounded function $L(x,y)$ whose time derivative $\\dot{L}(x,y)$ is negative definite over the entire state space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the unique fixed point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ is globally asymptotically stable. The argument applies on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ because the system is well-defined on this domain, unique solutions exist for all initial conditions in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and the constructed Lyapunov function and its derivative satisfy the required properties over all of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\nThe fixed point is $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{k_x}{\\gamma_x}, \\frac{k_y}{\\gamma_y}\\right)$.",

The degradation function $D(x)$ is a straight line passing through the origin with a positive slope $\\beta$.\n\nOne trivial fixed point always exists at $x=0$, as $P(0) = D(0) = 0$. Bistability requires the existence of three distinct fixed points. In this system, this corresponds to the line $y=D(x)$ intersecting the sigmoid $y=P(x)$ at three points: $x=0$ and two other positive concentrations.\n\nThe onset of bistability occurs at a saddle-node bifurcation, where two of the fixed points (one stable, one unstable) merge.

The steepness of the sigmoidal curve is a measure of its sensitivity to changes in $x$. A common measure is the slope at the half-maximal activation point, $x=K$. The derivative $P'(x)$ at $x=K$ is:\n$$\nP'(K) = \\frac{\\alpha n K^{n-1} K^n}{\\left(K^n + K^n\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha n K^{2n-1}}{\\left(2K^n\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha n K^{2n-1}}{4K^{2n}} = \\frac{\\alpha n}{4K}\n$$\nThis slope is directly proportional to $n$. Therefore, a larger Hill coefficient $n$ corresponds to a steeper, more switch-like transition from the low-expression to the high-expression state. This is what is meant by a \"sharper\" nullcline.\n\nSecond, we examine how increasing $n$ affects the critical ratio $(\\alpha/\\beta)_{crit}$ required for bistability. The derived critical value is proportional to the function $f(n) = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{(n-1)/n}}$. To analyze the behavior of $f(n)$ for $n>1$, we can study its derivative. Let's analyze the logarithm of $f(n)$:\n$$\n\\ln(f(n)) = \\ln(n) - \\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right)\\ln(n-1) = \\ln(n) - \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\ln(n-1)\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dn}\\ln(f(n)) = \\frac{1}{n} - \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\\ln(n-1) + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\frac{1}{n-1} \\right] = \\frac{1}{n} - \\left[ \\frac{\\ln(n-1)}{n^2} + \\frac{1}{n} \\right] = -\\frac{\\ln(n-1)}{n^2}\n$$\nSince the function $f(n)$ is always positive for $n>1$, the sign of its derivative $f'(n)$ is determined by the sign of $\\frac{d}{dn}\\ln(f(n))$.\n- For $1 < n < 2$, we have $0 < n-1 < 1$, so $\\ln(n-1) < 0$. This makes the derivative positive, so $f(n)$ is increasing.\n- At $n=2$, we have $\\ln(n-1) = \\ln(1) = 0$. This makes the derivative zero, indicating a critical point (a maximum).\n- For $n > 2$, we have $n-1 > 1$, so $\\ln(n-1) > 0$. This makes the derivative negative, so $f(n)$ is decreasing.\n\nThis analysis shows that increasing $n$ lowers the critical $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio required for bistability for the commonly considered range of integer cooperativities $n \\ge 2$. A sharper switch (higher $n > 2$) is more sensitive, enabling the system to support two stable states with a lower maximal synthesis rate $\\alpha$ relative to the degradation rate $\\beta$.",
