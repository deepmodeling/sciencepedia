            "problem": "A single-gene expression module is modeled as a well-mixed system in a fixed volume where a molecular species $X$ is synthesized constitutively from no reactant and degraded spontaneously. The reaction network is\n$$\n\\emptyset \\xrightarrow{k_b} X, \\quad X \\xrightarrow{k_d} \\emptyset.\n$$\nAssume deterministic dynamics under the law of mass action in the concentration-based formulation, where $X(t)$ denotes the concentration of $X$ as a function of time $t$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and the law of mass action, forming a standard model for constitutive gene expression. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive a unique steady-state solution. The language is objective and the requirements are unambiguous. The task is directly relevant to the steady-state analysis of simple systems in synthetic biology modeling. Therefore, a complete solution is presented.\n\nThe problem asks for three items: the derivation of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the concentration of species $X$, the computation of its steady-state concentration $X^*$, and a dimensional analysis of the rate constants $k_b$ and $k_d$ in two different modeling conventions.\n\nFirst, we derive the ODE governing the concentration of species $X$, denoted by $X(t)$. The system's dynamics are described by the net rate of change of $X(t)$, which is the sum of the rates of all reactions producing $X$ minus the sum of the rates of all reactions consuming $X$.\n$$\n\\frac{dX(t)}{dt} = (\\text{rate of production}) - (\\text{rate of consumption})\n$$\nThe system consists of two reactions:\n1. Synthesis: $\\emptyset \\xrightarrow{k_b} X$\n2. Degradation: $X \\xrightarrow{k_d} \\emptyset$\n\nWe apply the law of mass action to determine the rate of each reaction.\nFor the synthesis reaction, there are no reactants. This is a zeroth-order reaction, and its rate is constant, given by the rate constant $k_b$. This rate corresponds to the rate of production of $X$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of production} = k_b\n$$\nFor the degradation reaction, the reactant is $X$. This is a first-order reaction, and its rate is proportional to the concentration of $X$. The rate constant is $k_d$. This rate corresponds to the rate of consumption of $X$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of consumption} = k_d X(t)\n$$\nCombining these two rates, we obtain the ODE for $X(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dX(t)}{dt} = k_b - k_d X(t)\n$$\nThis is a linear first-order inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nNext, we compute the steady-state concentration, $X^*$. The steady state is defined as the condition where the system's state variables no longer change with time. For this system, it means the concentration of $X$ is constant. Mathematically, this corresponds to the time derivative being zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the ODE and replacing $X(t)$ with the steady-state concentration $X^*$:\n$$\n0 = k_b - k_d X^*\n$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $X^*$:\n$$\nk_d X^* = k_b\n$$\n$$\nX^* = \\frac{k_b}{k_d}\n$$\nThis is the unique, non-trivial steady-state concentration for the system.\n\nFinally, we perform a dimensional analysis to verify the consistency of the constants $k_b$ and $k_d$. The principle of dimensional homogeneity dictates that all additive terms in a physically meaningful equation must have the same dimensions. For our ODE, this means:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{dX}{dt}\\right] = [k_b] = [k_d X]\n$$\nLet $[C]$ denote the dimension of concentration (e.g., amount per volume, $M \\cdot L^{-3}$) and $[T]$ denote the dimension of time. The dimension of the derivative term is $[\\frac{dX}{dt}] = \\frac{[X]}{[t]} = \\frac{[C]}{[T]}$.\n\n(i) In the concentration-based convention, the variable $X$ has dimensions of concentration, so $[X] = [C]$.\n- For the synthesis constant $k_b$, we have $[k_b] = [\\frac{dX}{dt}] = \\frac{[C]}{[T]}$. Thus, $k_b$ has dimensions of concentration per time (e.g., M/s), which is consistent with a zeroth-order rate constant.\n- For the degradation term, we have $[k_d X] = \\frac{[C]}{[T]}$. This implies $[k_d][X] = [k_d][C] = \\frac{[C]}{[T]}$. Solving for $[k_d]$, we find $[k_d] = \\frac{1}{[T]}$. Thus, $k_d$ has dimensions of inverse time (e.g., $s^{-1}$), which is consistent with a first-order rate constant.\n\n(ii) In the copy-number-based convention, the state variable is the number of molecules, $N(t)$, which is a dimensionless quantity (its dimension is $[1]$). The production is described as a constant-rate source, which we can denote as $\\beta$, and the degradation is a first-order process with rate constant $\\delta$. The governing ODE for the copy number is $\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\beta - \\delta N$. We analyze the dimensions of the \"synthesis constant\" $\\beta$ and \"degradation constant\" $\\delta$ in this framework.\nThe dimensional homogeneity requirement is $[\\frac{dN}{dt}] = [\\beta] = [\\delta N]$.\nThe dimension of the derivative is $[\\frac{dN}{dt}] = \\frac{[N]}{[t]} = \\frac{[1]}{[T]}$.\n- For the synthesis constant $\\beta$, we have $[\\beta] = [\\frac{dN}{dt}] = \\frac{[1]}{[T]}$. Thus, $\\beta$ has dimensions of number per time (e.g., molecules/s).\n- For the degradation term, we have $[\\delta N] = \\frac{[1]}{[T]}$. This implies $[\\delta][N] = [\\delta][1] = \\frac{[1]}{[T]}$. Solving for $[\\delta]$, we find $[\\delta] = \\frac{1}{[T]}$. Thus, the degradation rate constant $\\delta$ has dimensions of inverse time (e.g., $s^{-1}$).\n\nIn both conventions, the dimensional analysis is consistent with the underlying physical and chemical principles. The degradation constant has the same units of inverse time, reflecting a constant probability of decay per molecule per unit time. The synthesis constant's units differ, appropriately reflecting the quantity being produced (concentration vs. absolute number) per unit time.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the stationary probability mass function, $P(n)$, for the copy number $n$ of a protein species. The system is modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain on the state space of non-negative integers $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the model based on the provided information.\nThe synthesis of the protein is a zero-order process, meaning it occurs at a constant rate, independent of the current protein copy number. This corresponds to a birth transition $n \\to n+1$ with a rate constant $k_b  0$. The total transition rate from state $n$ to $n+1$ is $W(n+1|n) = k_b$.\nThe degradation of the protein is a first-order process, meaning each molecule has a constant probability per unit time of being degraded. This corresponds to a death transition $n \\to n-1$. For a state with $n$ molecules, the total transition rate from state $n$ to $n-1$ is $W(n-1|n) = k_d n$, where $k_d  0$ is the degradation rate constant per molecule. This rate is zero for $n=0$.\n\nThe evolution of the probability distribution $P(n, t)$ over the states $n$ is described by the chemical master equation (CME). For any state $n$, the rate of change of its probability is the sum of probability fluxes into that state minus the sum of fluxes out of that state.\nThe master equation for a general state $n \\ge 1$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_b P(n-1,t)}_{\\text{birth from } n-1} + \\underbrace{k_d(n+1)P(n+1,t)}_{\\text{degradation from } n+1} - \\underbrace{k_b P(n,t)}_{\\text{birth to } n+1} - \\underbrace{k_d n P(n,t)}_{\\text{degradation to } n-1} $$\nFor the boundary state $n=0$, there is no degradation possible, so the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dP(0,t)}{dt} = \\underbrace{k_d P(1,t)}_{\\text{degradation from } n=1} - \\underbrace{k_b P(0,t)}_{\\text{birth to } n=1} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the stationary (or steady-state) probability mass function, which we denote as $P(n)$. This is the distribution for which the probabilities are time-independent, i.e., $\\frac{dP(n,t)}{dt} = 0$ for all $n$. Applying this stationarity condition to the CME yields a system of linear algebraic equations:\nFor $n=0$:\n$$ 0 = k_d P(1) - k_b P(0) $$\nFor $n \\ge 1$:\n$$ 0 = k_b P(n-1) + k_d(n+1)P(n+1) - (k_b + k_d n)P(n) $$\n\nThis system of equations can be solved directly, but the problem suggests using a balance-of-flux argument. For a one-dimensional birth-death process at steady state, there must be no net probability flux between any two adjacent states. This condition is known as detailed balance. The flux from state $n$ to $n+1$, $J_{n \\to n+1}$, is due to birth and is given by $k_b P(n)$. The flux from state $n+1$ to $n$, $J_{n+1 \\to n}$, is due to degradation and is given by $k_d(n+1)P(n+1)$.\nAt steady state, these fluxes must be equal for all $n \\ge 0$:\n$$ J_{n \\to n+1} = J_{n+1 \\to n} $$\n$$ k_b P(n) = k_d (n+1) P(n+1) $$\nThis equation defines a recurrence relation for the stationary probabilities $P(n)$.
