            "problem": "Two sister species, $\\mathrm{S_1}$ and $\\mathrm{S_2}$, diverged $T_{\\mathrm{spec}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{6}$ years ago. At a single nonrecombining locus that putatively experiences balancing selection, haplotypes sampled from both species form two deep allelic clades that are shared across species. Let the observed raw divergence between the consensus haplotypes representing these two allelic clades be $d = 0.015$ differences per site (that is, the proportion of nucleotide sites at which the clade representatives differ). Assume the per-site, per-generation mutation rate is $\\mu = 1.2 \\times 10^{-8}$, the Jukes–Cantor model of nucleotide substitution applies, and the generation time is $g = 6$ years per generation. \n\nStarting from appropriate first principles of the neutral coalescent with point mutation and a finite-sites correction consistent with the Jukes–Cantor model, estimate the allelic time to the most recent common ancestor (time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)) in years from the observed $d$, and then compare it to the species divergence time by computing the ratio\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{allele}}}{T_{\\mathrm{spec}}}.\n$$\nA value $R > 1$ would be consistent with a trans-species polymorphism. \n\nWhat is the numerical value of $R$? Express your final answer as a pure number (unitless) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{allele}}}{T_{\\mathrm{spec}}}$, where $T_{\\mathrm{allele}}$ is the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of two allelic clades and $T_{\\mathrm{spec}}$ is the species divergence time. This is a standard procedure in molecular evolution to test for trans-species polymorphism.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is necessary.\nThe provided givens are:\nSpecies divergence time, $T_{\\mathrm{spec}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{6}$ years.\nObserved raw divergence (proportion of differing sites), $d = 0.015$.\nPer-site, per-generation mutation rate, $\\mu = 1.2 \\times 10^{-8}$.\nGeneration time, $g = 6$ years.\nThe problem employs the Jukes–Cantor model for substitution correction.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary parameters and uses established models from evolutionary genetics. The values are physically and biologically plausible. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe first step is to convert the observed raw divergence, $d$, into an estimate of the expected number of substitutions per site, $K$. The raw divergence $d$ underestimates the true genetic distance because multiple substitution events at the same nucleotide site are not directly observed. The Jukes–Cantor model provides a correction for these multiple hits. The formula is:\n$$K = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3}d\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given value $d = 0.015$:\n$$K = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3}(0.015)\\right) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln (1 - 0.02) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln (0.98)$$\n\nThe second step is to relate this genetic distance $K$ to the divergence time. According to the molecular clock hypothesis, the expected number of substitutions per site between two homologous sequences is given by $K = 2 \\mu t$, where $\\mu$ is the mutation rate per site per generation and $t$ is the number of generations since the most recent common ancestor. The factor of $2$ accounts for the fact that mutations accumulate independently along the two lineages diverging from the ancestor. In our case, $t$ corresponds to the allelic TMRCA in generations, which we denote as $t_{\\mathrm{allele}}$.\n$$K = 2 \\mu t_{\\mathrm{allele}}$$\nWe can solve for $t_{\\mathrm{allele}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{allele}} = \\frac{K}{2\\mu}$$\nThe problem requires the time in years, $T_{\\mathrm{allele}}$. This is obtained by multiplying the time in generations by the generation time, $g$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{allele}} = t_{\\mathrm{allele}} \\cdot g = \\frac{Kg}{2\\mu}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $K$ derived from the Jukes-Cantor model into the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{allele}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{allele}} = \\frac{\\left(-\\frac{3}{4} \\ln(0.98)\\right) g}{2\\mu}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values for $g$ and $\\mu$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{allele}} = \\frac{-\\frac{3}{4} \\ln(0.98) \\cdot 6}{2 \\cdot (1.2 \\times 10^{-8})} = \\frac{-4.5 \\ln(0.98)}{2.4 \\times 10^{-8}}$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the required ratio, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{allele}}}{T_{\\mathrm{spec}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_{\\mathrm{allele}}$ and the given value for $T_{\\mathrm{spec}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{6}$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{-4.5 \\ln(0.98)}{2.4 \\times 10^{-8}}}{2.5 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{-4.5 \\ln(0.98)}{(2.4 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{6})}$$\nWe simplify the denominator:\n$$(2.4 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{6}) = (2.4 \\cdot 2.5) \\times 10^{-8+6} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.06$$\nThus, the expression for $R$ is:\n$$R = \\frac{-4.5 \\ln(0.98)}{0.06}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value.\nThe natural logarithm of $0.98$ is approximately $\\ln(0.98) \\approx -0.0202027$.\n$$R \\approx \\frac{-4.5 \\times (-0.0202027)}{0.06} \\approx \\frac{0.09091215}{0.06} \\approx 1.5152025$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain:\n$$R \\approx 1.515$$\nThis value, being greater than $1$, indicates that the estimated divergence time of the alleles predates the divergence of the species, which is consistent with the alleles being a trans-species polymorphism.",

Independent lines of evidence are collected in a genomic region surrounding the focal site:\n\n1. Genome-wide background: sliding-window tests yield $D(P_1,P_2,P_3,O)$ with mean approximately $0$ and $|Z| < 1.5$ across most windows; $f_4$-ratio estimates of admixture between $P_1$ and $P_2$ are near $0$ with narrow confidence intervals.\n\n2.

            "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific coherence and logical consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following data concerning a four-taxon system of species $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, and an outgroup $O$, with a species tree topology of $((P_1, P_2), P_3), O)$. $P_1$ and $P_2$ are sister species sharing an allele. The investigation concerns whether this sharing is due to trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or introgression.\n\n1.  **Genome-wide Background**:\n    *   Sliding-window $D(P_1,P_2,P_3,O)$ has a mean of approximately $0$.\n    *   The Z-score magnitude $|Z|$ is less than $1.5$ for most windows.\n    *   $f_4$-ratio estimates of admixture between $P_1$ and $P_2$ are near $0$ with narrow confidence intervals.\n\n2.  **Local Signals**:\n    *   In a $2$ kilobase ($kb$) window centered at the focal polymorphism, there are $n = 35$ informative sites.\n    *   In this focal window, the estimated $D$-statistic is $D \\approx 0.06$ with a standard error of approximately $0.07$, yielding a Z-score of $Z \\approx 0.86$.\n    *   In the two flanking $50$ kilobase ($kb$) windows, $D \\approx 0.00 \\pm 0.01$.\n    *   In these same flanking windows, $f_4$-ratio admixture estimates are $\\hat{\\alpha} \\approx 0.00$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of approximately $[-0.02, 0.02]$.\n\n3.  **Gene-Tree Topologies**:\n    *   In a $500$ base-pair ($bp$) segment containing the focal site, haplotypes from $P_1$ and $P_2$ cluster by allele state (e.g., allele $A$ from both species forms a clade, and allele $B$ from both species forms another). This is a trans-specific genealogy.\n    *   In adjacent $10$ kilobase ($kb$) flanks, genealogies recover the species tree, with $P_1$ haplotypes forming a monophyletic group and $P_2$ haplotypes forming another.\n\n4.  **Temporal and Haplotype-Length Evidence**:\n    *   The time to the most recent common ancestor ($T_{\\text{MRCA}}$) for the two allelic clades is estimated at $T_{\\text{MRCA}} \\approx 3.2$ million years (Mya), with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of $[2.5, 3.9]$ Mya.\n    *   The species split time between $P_1$ and $P_2$ ($T_S$) is dated to $T_S \\approx 1.1$ Mya, with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of $[0.9, 1.3]$ Mya.\n    *   Mean identical-by-state (IBS) tracts shared between carriers of the same allele in $P_1$ and $P_2$ are short, approximately $0.3$ kilobases ($kb$).\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It presents a classic scenario in evolutionary genomics: distinguishing introgression from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), specifically the case of long-term balancing selection leading to trans-species polymorphism. The methods cited—the $D$-statistic (ABBA-BABA test), $f_4$-ratio, gene-tree topological analysis, coalescence time estimation ($T_{\\text{MRCA}}$), and haplotype tract length analysis—are standard and appropriate for this question. The data provided are internally consistent and plausible. For example, the genome-wide background shows no evidence of large-scale gene flow, correctly focusing the problem on a localized genomic region. The local data present a clear contrast between the focal site and its flanks, which is the expected pattern for a localized evolutionary process. The temporal data ($T_{\\text{MRCA}} > T_S$) is a key piece of evidence. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to formulate a rigorous scientific conclusion.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe task is to formulate a decision rule to reject the hypothesis of introgression in favor of trans-species polymorphism, using the provided lines of evidence. We must analyze the expected signatures of each phenomenon from first principles.\n\n**Trans-Species Polymorphism (TSP)** arises when a polymorphism existing in an ancestral population is maintained by balancing selection across a speciation event. Its characteristic signatures are:\n1.  **Deep Coalescence**: The common ancestor of the polymorphic alleles ($T_{\\text{MRCA}}$) must predate the speciation event ($T_S$). Thus, a key signature is $T_{\\text{MRCA}} > T_S$.\n2.  **Localized Genealogical Discordance**: At the locus under selection, the gene tree will not match the species tree. Haplotypes will cluster by allele type, not by species. However, due to recombination, this discordant signal is confined to a very small region. In the flanking regions, genealogies should revert to the species tree topology.\n3.  **Absence of Introgression Signal in Flanks**: Since the pattern is not due to post-speciation gene flow, there should be no extended block of shared ancestry. Statistical tests for introgression like the $D$-statistic or $f_4$-ratio should yield non-significant results (i.e., values close to $0$) in the genomic regions flanking the selected locus.\n4.  **Short Shared Haplotypes**: The allelic lineages have been diverging for a long time (since before $T_S$). Recombination acting over this extended period will have broken down ancestral haplotypes, leaving only very short tracts of identity around the selected site itself.\n\n**Introgression** is the transfer of genetic material between species after they have diverged. Its signatures are:\n1.  **Recent Coalescence**: An introgressed allele would show a coalescence time between the donor and recipient lineages that is more recent than the species split time.\n2.  **Extended Block of Discordance**: Introgression transfers a block of DNA. While recombination breaks this block down over time, recent introgression will result in a relatively long shared haplotype and a correspondingly large genomic window where gene trees are discordant with the species tree.\n3.  **Significant Signal of Admixture**: The excess sharing of derived alleles resulting from introgression will produce a statistically significant non-zero $D$-statistic or $f_4$-ratio in the introgressed region and its immediate flanks, before recombination fully breaks down the linkage.\n\n**Applying these Principles to the Data**\nThe provided data align perfectly with the expectations for trans-species polymorphism and contradict the expectations for introgression.\n-   **Temporal Evidence**: $T_{\\text{MRCA}} \\approx 3.2$ Mya is significantly greater than $T_S \\approx 1.1$ Mya. This is the strongest evidence for TSP.\n-   **Genealogical Evidence**: The gene tree is trans-specific at the focal locus but matches the species tree in the flanks. This localizes the signal, as expected for TSP.\n-   **Admixture Statistics**: The $D$-statistic and $f_4$-ratio are approximately $0$ in the flanks, with tight confidence intervals. This provides strong evidence against an introgressed block of any substantial size. The non-significant $D$-statistic in the focal window itself ($Z \\approx 0.86$) further argues against introgression.\n-   **Haplotype Evidence**: The shared IBS tracts are very short ($\\approx 0.3$ kb), which is inconsistent with recent introgression and consistent with an ancient shared polymorphism eroded by recombination over millions of years.\n\nTherefore, a correct decision rule must integrate these observations. The rule for rejecting introgression in favor of TSP must require (1) a lack of statistical evidence for introgression in the genomic background surrounding the locus, (2) a switch in gene-tree topology from trans-specific at the locus to species-concordant in the flanks, and (3) a coalescence time for the alleles that significantly predates the species split.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n**A. Reject introgression in favor of trans-species polymorphism if, in recombination-delimited windows flanking the focal site, $D$ and $f_4$-ratio estimates testing $P_1$–$P_2$ gene flow are not significantly different from $0$, the focal-site genealogy groups haplotypes by allele state across species while adjacent flanks recover the species tree, and $T_{\\text{MRCA}}$ for allelic clades exceeds $T_S$. Under these joint conditions, infer an ancient balanced polymorphism rather than introgression.**\nThis option correctly synthesizes the multiple, crucial lines of evidence. It requires the absence of a gene flow signal in the flanks ($D \\approx 0, f_4 \\approx 0$), the specific pattern of localized genealogical discordance, and the definitive temporal criterion ($T_{\\text{MRCA}} > T_S$). This is a comprehensive and scientifically rigorous rule.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Reject introgression in favor of trans-species polymorphism whenever any window spanning the focal site yields a non-zero $D$, regardless of sign, magnitude, or statistical significance, because any deviation from $0$ is incompatible with the null of no gene flow.**\nThis option is fundamentally flawed. The $D$-statistic is a random variable; it is expected to deviate from $0$ due to stochasticity (e.g., ILS, sampling error). Scientific inference requires hypothesis testing to determine if the deviation is statistically significant. Ignoring statistical significance is an egregious error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Reject introgression in favor of trans-species polymorphism whenever the local gene tree at the focal site mixes $P_1$ and $P_2$ haplotypes, even if flanking $D$ is significantly non-zero, because mixture of species within a clade necessarily reflects ancestral polymorphism.**\nThis option commits two errors. First, a mixed (trans-specific) gene tree is characteristic of *both* TSP and introgression; it cannot distinguish between them alone. Second, the assertion that it reflects ancestral polymorphism \"even if flanking $D$ is significantly non-zero\" is precisely backward. A significant $D$-statistic in the flanks is strong evidence *for* introgression.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Reject introgression in favor of trans-species polymorphism only if $D$ is significantly non-zero with opposite signs on either side of the focal site, because sign flips in $D$ across flanks indicate that incomplete lineage sorting cannot explain the data.**\nThis describes a specific, complex pattern that can sometimes arise under balancing selection but is not a necessary or universal signature. To posit this as the *only* condition (\"only if\") is far too restrictive. The more fundamental evidence, such as $T_{\\text{MRCA}} > T_S$ and null $D$ in flanks, is more general and powerful. This rule is not consistent with the provided data where flanking $D \\approx 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Reject introgression in favor of trans-species polymorphism when the $f_4$-ratio admixture estimate $\\hat{\\alpha}$ between $P_1$ and $P_2$ is significantly greater than $0$ specifically in the focal window, on the grounds that focal excess sharing must reflect an ancient polymorphism rather than recent gene flow.**\nThis option fundamentally misinterprets the statistic. A significant, positive admixture estimate ($\\hat{\\alpha} > 0$) is the canonical signal of excess allele sharing due to introgression. To claim this \"must reflect an ancient polymorphism\" is a direct contradiction of the statistic's purpose and standard interpretation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option A formulates a scientifically correct and comprehensive decision rule based on the provided data and established principles of evolutionary genetics.",

If we compute the corrected AIC (AICc) to assess finite-sample bias, the corrections are small given $n = 200$:\n- $\\mathrm{AICc}_S = 3632.0 + \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8}{200 - 7 - 1} = 3632.0 + \\dfrac{112}{192} \\approx 3632.583$.\n- $\\mathrm{AICc}_I = 3640.2 + \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9}{200 - 8 - 1} = 3640.2 + \\dfrac{144}{191} \\approx 3640.954$.\nThis again favors $\\mathcal{M}_S$.\n\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC):\n- $\\ln n = \\ln 200 \\approx 5.298317$.\n- $\\mathrm{BIC}_S = 7 \\cdot 5.298317 - 2(-1809.0) = 37.088219 + 3618.0 = 3655.088219$.\n- $\\mathrm{BIC}_I = 8 \\cdot 5.298317 - 2(-1812.1) = 42.386536 + 3624.2 = 3666.586536$.\nThus, $\\mathrm{BIC}_S < \\mathrm{BIC}_I$, again favoring $\\mathcal{M}_S$.\n\nInterpretation in terms of trans-species polymorphism: $\\mathcal{M}_S$ explicitly encodes long-term balancing selection that can maintain allelic lineages across the speciation event, producing deep coalescence and allele sharing consistent with trans-species polymorphism. $\\mathcal{M}_I$ explains allele sharing via more recent introgression without long-term balancing selection. Because both AIC and BIC favor $\\mathcal{M}_S$ given the data, the model comparison supports the hypothesis that trans-species polymorphism, rather than introgression alone, best explains the observed pattern.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: It proposes the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), correctly applicable to non-nested models, and states that under the reported fits the criterion favors $\\mathcal{M}_S$. Our calculations show $\\mathrm{AIC}_S = 3632.0$ and $\\mathrm{AIC}_I = 3640.2$, so this is Correct.\n- Option B: It proposes a likelihood ratio test treating $\\mathcal{M}_I$ as the null and using a $\\chi^2$ reference with $k_I - k_S = 1$ degree of freedom. This is not valid because the models are non-nested; the asymptotic $\\chi^2$ result requires nestedness and regular conditions. Therefore, this is Incorrect, regardless of any numerical outcome.\n- Option C: It proposes the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is appropriate for non-nested models as an approximation to log marginal likelihood, and concludes it favors $\\mathcal{M}_S$ for $n = 200$. Our calculation shows $\\mathrm{BIC}_S \\approx 3655.09$ and $\\mathrm{BIC}_I \\approx 3666.59$, so this is Correct.\n- Option D: It recommends cross-validation but evaluates models by training negative log-likelihood, which is not cross-validation and does not estimate out-of-sample predictive performance; using training error can systematically favor more flexible models and is not an appropriate non-nested comparison. This is Incorrect.\n- Option E: It recommends choosing by raw maximized log-likelihood without penalizing complexity. Although $\\ln \\hat{L}_S = -1809.0$ is larger than $\\ln \\hat{L}_I = -1812.1$, ignoring complexity penalties is not a principled model selection approach and is not appropriate for comparing non-nested models with different $k$. This is Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and C.",
