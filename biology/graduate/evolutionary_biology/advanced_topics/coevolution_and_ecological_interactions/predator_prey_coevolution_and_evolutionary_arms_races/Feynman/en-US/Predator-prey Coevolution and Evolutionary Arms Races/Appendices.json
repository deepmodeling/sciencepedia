This practice explores the crucial role of trade-offs, specifically how the mathematical form of a cost function can determine the ultimate fate of a coevolutionary arms race.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model from theoretical evolutionary biology, utilizing established principles of quantitative genetics and game theory. All necessary parameters and functional forms are provided for a formal mathematical analysis. The problem is therefore valid, and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests upon the selection gradients, which dictate the direction of evolutionary change for the traits. For the prey trait $x$ and predator trait $y$, the selection gradients are the partial derivatives of the respective Malthusian fitness functions:\n$$\n\\text{Gradient}_{\\text{prey}} = \\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{prey}}(x,y)}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Gradient}_{\\text{pred}} = \\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{pred}}(x,y)}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThe sign of these gradients determines whether selection favors an increase or decrease in the trait values.\n\nPart (i): Linear Costs\n\nFirst, we consider the case of linear costs, where $C_{x}(x) = c_{x}x$ and $C_{y}(y) = c_{y}y$. The interaction function is given as $S(y-x) = s(y-x)$. Substituting these into the general fitness functions yields:\n$$\nw_{\\text{prey}}(x,y) = r_{0} - \\alpha s (y - x) - c_{x}x\n$$\n$$\nw_{\\text{pred}}(x,y) = -d + \\beta s (y - x) - c_{y}y\n$$\nWe compute the selection gradients by differentiation. For the prey trait $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{prey}}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (r_{0} - \\alpha s y + \\alpha s x - c_{x}x) = \\alpha s - c_{x}\n$$\nFor the predator trait $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{pred}}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (-d + \\beta s y - \\beta s x - c_{y}y) = \\beta s - c_{y}\n$$\nUnbounded escalation of traits requires that selection consistently favors larger trait values, meaning both selection gradients must be strictly positive for all $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$. As derived, these gradients are constant with respect to the trait values $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the condition for unbounded escalation is simply:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{prey}}}{\\partial x} > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\alpha s - c_{x} > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad c_{x} < \\alpha s\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{pred}}}{\\partial y} > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\beta s - c_{y} > 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad c_{y} < \\beta s\n$$\nThe critical marginal-cost thresholds are the values at which the evolutionary dynamic changes from positive selection (escalation) to neutral or negative selection. These thresholds are defined by the equalities $c_{x} = \\alpha s$ and $c_{y} = \\beta s$. Thus, the critical threshold for the prey's marginal cost is $\\alpha s$, and for the predator's marginal cost, it is $\\beta s$. If the marginal costs $c_x$ and $c_y$ are below these respective thresholds, the benefit of increasing the trait always outweighs the cost, leading to an open-ended arms race.\n\nPart (ii): Convex (Quadratic) Costs\n\nNext, we consider the case of strictly convex quadratic costs, $C_{x}(x) = \\frac{a_{x}}{2}x^{2}$ and $C_{y}(y) = \\frac{a_{y}}{2}y^{2}$. The fitness functions become:\n$$\nw_{\\text{prey}}(x,y) = r_{0} - \\alpha s (y - x) - \\frac{a_{x}}{2}x^{2}\n$$\n$$\nw_{\\text{pred}}(x,y) = -d + \\beta s (y - x) - \\frac{a_{y}}{2}y^{2}\n$$\nWe again compute the selection gradients. For the prey trait $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{prey}}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (r_{0} - \\alpha s y + \\alpha s x - \\frac{a_{x}}{2}x^{2}) = \\alpha s - a_{x}x\n$$\nFor the predator trait $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{pred}}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (-d + \\beta s y - \\beta s x - \\frac{a_{y}}{2}y^{2}) = \\beta s - a_{y}y\n$$\nAn evolutionarily stationary point $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$ is an equilibrium where directional selection ceases, which occurs when both selection gradients are equal to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{prey}}}{\\partial x} \\bigg|_{(x^{\\star},y^{\\star})} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\alpha s - a_{x}x^{\\star} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_{\\text{pred}}}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{(x^{\\star},y^{\\star})} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\beta s - a_{y}y^{\\star} = 0\n$$\nThis is a system of two linear, uncoupled equations. The lack of coupling is a direct result of the model's structure, where the interaction term is a function of the difference $y-x$ and costs are separable. Solving for $x^{\\star}$ and $y^{\\star}$ is trivial:\n$$\nx^{\\star} = \\frac{\\alpha s}{a_{x}}\n$$\n$$\ny^{\\star} = \\frac{\\beta s}{a_{y}}\n$$\nSince all parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, s, a_{x}, a_{y}$ are given as positive, the stationary values $x^{\\star}$ and $y^{\\star}$ are unique, finite, and positive.\n\nThese equilibria bound the arms race because they represent a stable state to which the system converges. The dynamics exhibit negative feedback. For the prey, the selection gradient is $\\alpha s - a_{x}x$. If $x < x^{\\star}$, the gradient is positive and $x$ increases. If $x > x^{\\star}$, the gradient is negative and $x$ decreases. Similarly for the predator, if $y < y^{\\star}$, the gradient $\\beta s - a_{y}y$ is positive and $y$ increases; if $y > y^{\\star}$, the gradient is negative and $y$ decreases. The quadratic costs impose a marginal cost that increases linearly with the trait value ($a_x x$ for prey, $a_y y$ for predator). This increasing cost eventually balances the constant marginal benefit from the interaction ($\\alpha s$ for prey, $\\beta s$ for predator), halting the escalation at a finite equilibrium. This guarantees that the arms race does not proceed indefinitely but instead is bounded by the stationary point $(x^{\\star}, y^{\\star})$. This demonstrates stabilizing selection for any trait value away from the equilibrium.\n\nThe final result requires the two critical thresholds from Part (i) and the two stationary values from Part (ii) in a single row matrix.",
