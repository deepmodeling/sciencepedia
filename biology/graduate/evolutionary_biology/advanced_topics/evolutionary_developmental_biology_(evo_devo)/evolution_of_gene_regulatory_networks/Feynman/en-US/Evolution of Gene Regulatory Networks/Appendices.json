It is a standard exercise in statistical biophysics. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe system is described by the grand canonical ensemble. The grand partition function, $\\mathcal{Z}$, is the sum of Boltzmann weights over all accessible microstates. A microstate is defined by its energy, $E_n$, and particle number, $n$. The Boltzmann weight for a state $(E_n, n)$ is $\\exp(-\\beta(E_n - n\\mu))$.\n\nThe system has two microstates:\n1. Unbound state: $n=0$. We define the energy of this reference state as $E_0=0$.\n2. Bound state: $n=1$. The energy of this state is given as $E_1 = \\Delta E$ relative to the unbound state.\n\nThe Boltzmann weights for these two states are:\n- For $n=0$: $w_0 = \\exp(-\\beta(E_0 - 0 \\cdot \\mu)) = \\exp(-\\beta(0)) = 1$.\n- For $n=1$: $w_1 = \\exp(-\\beta(E_1 - 1 \\cdot \\mu)) = \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu))$.\n\nThe grand partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$ is the sum of these weights:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = w_0 + w_1 = 1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu))\n$$\n\nThe equilibrium occupancy, $\\theta$, is the probability of the site being in the bound state ($n=1$). This probability is the ratio of the Boltzmann weight of the bound state to the grand partition function.\n$$\n\\theta = P(n=1) = \\frac{w_1}{\\mathcal{Z}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu))}{1 + \\exp(-\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu))}\n$$\nThis expression can be algebraically rearranged by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu))$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu)) + 1}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem. This functional form is known as the Fermi-Dirac distribution.\n\nNext, we must derive the sensitivity of the occupancy with respect to the binding energy, $\\partial \\theta / \\partial \\Delta E$. We differentiate the expression for $\\theta$ with respect to $\\Delta E$, holding $\\beta$ and $\\mu$ constant.\nLet $X = \\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu)$. Then $\\theta = (1 + \\exp(X))^{-1}$.\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\Delta E} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dX} \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\Delta E}$.\nFirst, we find $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\Delta E}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\Delta E} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\Delta E} (\\beta\\Delta E - \\beta\\mu) = \\beta\n$$\nNext, we find $\\frac{d\\theta}{dX}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dX} = \\frac{d}{dX} (1 + \\exp(X))^{-1} = -1 \\cdot (1 + \\exp(X))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(X) = -\\frac{\\exp(X)}{(1 + \\exp(X))^2}\n$$\nCombining these results:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\Delta E} = -\\beta \\frac{\\exp(\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu))}{(1 + \\exp(\\beta(\\Delta E - \\mu)))^2}\n$$\nThis expression for the sensitivity can be written more compactly in terms of $\\theta$. We note that:\n$$\n1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(X)} = \\frac{1 + \\exp(X) - 1}{1 + \\exp(X)} = \\frac{\\exp(X)}{1 + \\exp(X)}\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\Delta E} = -\\beta \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(X)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\exp(X)}{1 + \\exp(X)}\\right) = -\\beta \\theta(1-\\theta)\n$$\nThis completes the second part of the derivation.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the change in occupancy, $\\Delta \\theta$, resulting from a small change in binding energy, $\\delta \\Delta E$, using a first-order Taylor expansion.\nThe expansion is given by $\\Delta \\theta \\approx \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\Delta E} \\delta \\Delta E$.\nWe are given the following values:\n- The change in binding energy is $\\delta \\Delta E = 0.5\\,k_{B}T$.

The variance is given by the fluctuation-dissipation relation $\\sigma^2 = \\dfrac{D(M)}{2\\lambda} = \\dfrac{a_{+}(M) + a_{-}(M)}{-2 f'(M)}$. The coefficient of variation is defined as $\\mathrm{CV} = \\dfrac{\\sigma}{M}$.\n\nWe will now apply this formalism to both systems.\n\nFor the unregulated system:\nThe net rate function is $f_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(x) = \\alpha - \\gamma x$.\nThe derivative is $f'_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(x) = -\\gamma$, which is constant. So, $f'_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(M) = -\\gamma$.\nAt steady state, $a_+(M) = \\alpha = \\gamma M$ and $a_-(M) = \\gamma M$.\nThe noise intensity is $D_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(M) = a_{+}(M) + a_{-}(M) = \\gamma M + \\gamma M = 2\\gamma M$.\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(X) = \\dfrac{2\\gamma M}{-2(-\\gamma)} = M$.\nThe coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{unreg}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}(X)}}{M} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{M}}{M} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}$.\n\nFor the negatively autoregulated system:\nThe net rate function is $f_{\\mathrm{auto}}(x) = \\dfrac{k_{\\max}}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma x$.\nIts derivative is $f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(x) = k_{\\max} \\cdot (-1) \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{nx^{n-1}}{K^n}\\right) - \\gamma = -\\dfrac{k_{\\max} n x^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} - \\gamma$.\nWe evaluate this at $x=M$ and substitute the expression for $k_{\\max}$:\n$f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M) = -\\dfrac{\\gamma M \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right) n M^{n-1}}{K^n \\left(1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^{n}\\right)^2} - \\gamma = -\\dfrac{\\gamma n M^n/K^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^{n}} - \\gamma$.\nFactoring out $-\\gamma$, we get $f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M) = -\\gamma \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)$.\nAt steady state, $a_+(M) = a_-(M) = \\gamma M$.\nThe noise intensity is $D_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M) = a_{+}(M) + a_{-}(M) = \\gamma M + \\gamma M = 2\\gamma M$.\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{auto}}(X) = \\dfrac{D_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M)}{-2 f'_{\\mathrm{auto}}(M)} = \\dfrac{2\\gamma M}{-2 \\left(-\\gamma \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)\\right)} = \\dfrac{M}{1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}}$.\nThe coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{auto}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{auto}}(X)}}{M} = \\dfrac{1}{M}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{M}{1 + \\dfrac{n \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{M}{K}\\right)^n}}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}} \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\dfrac{n\\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the fold-change in the coefficient of variation:\n$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{auto}}}{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}} \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n\\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)^{-1/2}}{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{n\\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}{1 + \\left(\\frac{M}{K}\\right)^n}\\right)^{-1/2}$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given numerical values: $M = 100$, $K = 100$, and $n = 2$.\nThe ratio $\\dfrac{M}{K} = \\dfrac{100}{100} = 1$.\nSubstituting these values into the fold-change expression:\n$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{auto}}}{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\mathrm{unreg}}} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2 \\cdot (1)^2}{1 + (1)^2}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2}{1+1}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^{-1/2} = (1+1)^{-1/2} = (2)^{-1/2} = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nNumerically, this value is approximately $0.70710678...$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.7071$.",
