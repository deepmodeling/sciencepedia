This first exercise provides the essential hands-on practice by applying the concept of Wrightian fitness to calculate the change in genotype frequencies over a single, discrete generation.

            "problem": "A large, well-mixed, asexual haploid population consists of three genotypes, indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Each genotype $i$ has a constant Wrightian fitness $w_i$ that scales its expected contribution to the next generation in a single, discrete, non-overlapping generation life cycle with no mutation, migration, or genetic drift. At the start of generation $t$, the genotype frequency vector is $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ with $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$. Selection acts via differential survival/reproduction so that the expected number of surviving offspring descending from genotype $i$ is proportional to $w_i$ times the number of genotype-$i$ parents. Let $\\bar{w}$ denote the population mean fitness (the average per-capita success across genotypes, weighted by current frequencies), and let $(p_1', p_2', p_3')$ denote the genotype frequencies at the start of generation $t+1$ after selection and normalization. \n\nIn a particular experiment, the three genotypes have fitnesses $w = (1.00, 1.05, 0.98)$ and initial frequencies $(p_1, p_2, p_3) = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)$ at generation $t$. Starting strictly from the definitions above (that genotype contributions are proportional to $w_i$ and that frequencies must normalize to sum to $1$), compute the next-generation frequency vector $(p_1', p_2', p_3')$ and the next-generation mean fitness $\\bar{w}'$. \n\nReport your final numerical results as a single row vector $(p_1', p_2', p_3', \\bar{w}')$, with each entry rounded to four significant figures. Express the entries as plain decimals (no percentage signs). No other quantities should be reported.",
            "solution": "The problem presents a standard model of discrete-time population genetics for a haploid, asexual population. The task is to compute the genotype frequencies and the population mean fitness in the next generation, given the initial frequencies and fitness values for three genotypes. The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. It is therefore valid.\n\nLet the population at generation $t$ be described by the frequency vector of the three genotypes, $\\boldsymbol{p} = (p_1, p_2, p_3)$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i = 1$. The corresponding Wrightian fitnesses are given by the vector $\\boldsymbol{w} = (w_1, w_2, w_3)$. The problem states that the expected contribution of each genotype to the subsequent generation is proportional to its fitness and current frequency.\n\nLet the total population size at the beginning of generation $t$ be $N$. The number of individuals of genotype $i$ is $N_i = p_i N$. The number of offspring produced by genotype $i$, let us denote it $N'_i$, is proportional to $w_i N_i$. Therefore, we can write $N'_i = C w_i N_i$ for some constant of proportionality $C$ that is identical for all genotypes.\n\nThe total number of individuals in the offspring generation, before normalization, is the sum over all genotypes:\n$$N' = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} N'_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} C w_i N_i = C \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i (p_i N) = C N \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i p_i$$\nThe frequency of genotype $i$ in the next generation, $p'_i$, is the ratio of the number of its offspring to the total number of offspring:\n$$p'_i = \\frac{N'_i}{N'} = \\frac{C w_i N_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} C w_j N_j} = \\frac{w_i (p_i N)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} w_j (p_j N)}$$\nThe constants $C$ and $N$ cancel, yielding the fundamental recurrence relation:\n$$p'_i = \\frac{p_i w_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3} p_j w_j}$$\nThe denominator is the population mean fitness at generation $t$, defined as the weighted average of the individual fitnesses:\n$$\\bar{w} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i w_i$$\nThus, the frequency of genotype $i$ at generation $t+1$ is given by:\n$$p'_i = \\frac{p_i w_i}{\\bar{w}}$$\nThe given data for generation $t$ are:\n- Frequencies: $(p_1, p_2, p_3) = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2)$\n- Fitnesses: $(w_1, w_2, w_3) = (1.00, 1.05, 0.98)$\n\nFirst, we compute the mean fitness $\\bar{w}$ for generation $t$:\n$$\\bar{w} = p_1 w_1 + p_2 w_2 + p_3 w_3$$\n$$\\bar{w} = (0.5)(1.00) + (0.3)(1.05) + (0.2)(0.98) = 0.500 + 0.315 + 0.196 = 1.011$$\nNow we can compute the frequencies for the next generation, $(p'_1, p'_2, p'_3)$:\n$$p'_1 = \\frac{p_1 w_1}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{(0.5)(1.00)}{1.011} = \\frac{0.500}{1.011} \\approx 0.4945598...$$\n$$p'_2 = \\frac{p_2 w_2}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{(0.3)(1.05)}{1.011} = \\frac{0.315}{1.011} \\approx 0.3115727...$$\n$$p'_3 = \\frac{p_3 w_3}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{(0.2)(0.98)}{1.011} = \\frac{0.196}{1.011} \\approx 0.1938674...$$\nThe problem requires these values to be rounded to four significant figures:\n- $p'_1 \\approx 0.4946$\n- $p'_2 \\approx 0.3116$\n- $p'_3 \\approx 0.1939$\n\nNext, we must compute the mean fitness of the population at generation $t+1$, denoted $\\bar{w}'$.

The prime factors of the denominator are $199000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3 \\times 199$. There are no common factors, so the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThe classical result that mean fitness always increases, often a simplified interpretation of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, is not universally applicable. It is evaded in this example due to the interaction of **epistasis** and **recombination**.\nThe fitness landscape exhibits strong positive epistasis: the \"coupling\" haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$ are significantly fitter ($w=1.2$) than the \"repulsion\" haplotypes $Ab$ and $aB$ ($w=0.9$). The population begins with positive linkage disequilibrium ($D(t) = 0.49^2 - 0.01^2 = 0.24  0$), meaning an excess of the fit haplotypes. Selection acts to further enrich these haplotypes, which increases mean fitness within the generation. However, recombination acts to break down these favorable allelic combinations, generating more of the less-fit repulsion haplotypes. In this specific case, the decrease in mean fitness caused by recombination is greater than the increase caused by selection, leading to a net decrease in mean fitness from one generation to the next ($\\Delta \\bar{w}  0$). This demonstrates that in multi-locus systems with epistasis, recombination can drive mean fitness down, causing the population to move away from a fitness peak.",

It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and conditions ($N_e, s, h, x_0$, and the asymptotic regime) to derive a unique solution for the fixation probabilities. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard, canonical exercise in calculating fixation probabilities under different dominance schemes and does not suffer from any of the flaws listed in the validation protocol.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe derivation of the fixation probability, $u(p)$, for an allele with initial frequency $p$ is based on Kimura's diffusion theory. The general formula for the fixation probability is:\n$$ u(p) = \\frac{\\int_0^p G(x) dx}{\\int_0^1 G(x) dx} $$\nwhere $G(x) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_0^x \\frac{M(y)}{V(y)} dy\\right)$. Here, $M(y)$ is the expected change in allele frequency per generation due to selection, and $V(y)$ is the variance in allele frequency change per generation due to genetic drift.\n\nFor a diploid Wright-Fisher population of size $N_e$, these quantities are:\n-   $V(y) = \\frac{y(1-y)}{2N_e}$\n-   $M(y) = \\Delta y_{\\mathrm{sel}}$, the change in frequency from selection alone.\n\nThe mean fitness of the population is $\\bar{w} = (1-y)^2 w_{AA} + 2y(1-y)w_{Aa} + y^2 w_{aa} = 1 + 2y(1-y)hs + y^2 s$.\nThe change in allele frequency due to selection is given by $\\Delta y_{\\mathrm{sel}} = \\frac{y(1-y)}{2\\bar{w}} \\frac{d\\bar{w}}{dy}$.\nFor weak selection ($s \\ll 1$), $\\bar{w} \\approx 1$.\n$\\frac{d\\bar{w}}{dy} = 2(1-2y)hs + 2ys = 2(hs + (s-2hs)y)$.\nSo, $M(y) \\approx y(1-y)(hs + (s-2hs)y)$.\nThe ratio $\\frac{M(y)}{V(y)}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{M(y)}{V(y)} = \\frac{y(1-y)(hs + (s-2hs)y)}{y(1-y)/(2N_e)} = 2N_e (hs + (s-2hs)y) $$\nThe function $G(x)$ is then:\n$$ G(x) = \\exp\\left(-2 \\int_0^x 2N_e (hs + (s-2hs)y) dy\\right) = \\exp\\left(-4N_e \\left(hsx + \\frac{s(1-2h)}{2}x^2\\right)\\right) $$\nWe now apply this general formula to the two specified cases. The initial frequency is $p = x_0 = 1/(2N_e)$.\n\n**Case 1: Additive Allele ($h = 1/2$)**\nFor the additive case, we set $h=1/2$. The term $s(1-2h)$ becomes $0$.\n$G(x) = \\exp\\left(-4N_e \\left(\\frac{s}{2}x\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-2N_e s x)$.\nThe fixation probability $u_{\\mathrm{add}}$ is:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{add}} = \\frac{\\int_0^{1/(2N_e)} e^{-2N_e s x} dx}{\\int_0^1 e^{-2N_e s x} dx} $$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{add}} = \\frac{\\left[\\frac{e^{-2N_e s x}}{-2N_e s}\\right]_0^{1/(2N_e)}}{\\left[\\frac{e^{-2N_e s x}}{-2N_e s}\\right]_0^1} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-2N_e s \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)}{1 - \\exp(-2N_e s)} = \\frac{1-e^{-s}}{1-e^{-2N_e s}} $$\nIn the specified asymptotic regime, $s \\ll 1$ and $N_e s \\gg 1$.\n-   The numerator, for $s \\ll 1$, is $1 - e^{-s} \\approx 1 - (1-s) = s$.\n-   The denominator, for $N_e s \\gg 1$, is $1 - e^{-2N_e s} \\approx 1$.\nThus, the leading-order expression for the fixation probability of an additive allele is:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx s $$\n\n**Case 2: Fully Recessive Allele ($h = 0$)**\nFor the fully recessive case, we set $h=0$.\n$G(x) = \\exp\\left(-4N_e \\left(0 \\cdot x + \\frac{s}{2}x^2\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-2N_e s x^2)$.\nThe fixation probability $u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ is:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{rec}} = \\frac{\\int_0^{1/(2N_e)} e^{-2N_e s x^2} dx}{\\int_0^1 e^{-2N_e s x^2} dx} $$\nFor the numerator, the integration is over a very small interval $[0, 1/(2N_e)]$. In this interval, the exponent $-2N_e s x^2$ is close to zero, so $e^{-2N_e s x^2} \\approx 1$.\n$$ \\text{Numerator} \\approx \\int_0^{1/(2N_e)} 1 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2N_e} $$\nFor the denominator, we have the integral $\\int_0^1 \\exp(-2N_e s x^2) dx$. Let $a = 2N_e s$. The integral is $\\int_0^1 e^{-ax^2} dx$.\nWith the substitution $y = \\sqrt{a}x$, we get $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{a}} e^{-y^2} dy$.\nSince we are in the regime $N_e s \\gg 1$, $a \\gg 1$ and $\\sqrt{a} \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\text{Denominator} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2N_e s}} \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-y^2} dy = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2N_e s}} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{2N_e s}} $$\nCombining the numerator and denominator:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\frac{1/(2N_e)}{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{2N_e s}}} = \\frac{1}{2N_e} \\frac{2\\sqrt{2N_e s}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2N_e s}}{N_e \\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2N_e s}{N_e^2 \\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2s}{\\pi N_e}} $$\n\n**Ratio of Fixation Probabilities**\nThe ratio of the fixation probabilities is:\n$$ \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{add}}}{u_{\\mathrm{rec}}} \\approx \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2s}{\\pi N_e}}} = s \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi N_e}{2s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2 \\pi N_e}{2s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi N_e s}{2}} $$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\nWe now evaluate each option based on the derived results:\n-   $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx s$\n-   $u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2s}{\\pi N_e}}$\n-   $u_{\\mathrm{add}}/u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi N_e s}{2}}$\n\n-   **A. $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx s$, $u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2s}{\\pi N_e}}$, and $u_{\\mathrm{add}}/u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\pi N_e s}{2}}$.**\n    This statement perfectly matches our derived expressions for $u_{\\mathrm{add}}$, $u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, and their ratio.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx 2s$, $u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx 0$, and $u_{\\mathrm{add}}/u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ diverges to $+\\infty$.**\n    The expression for $u_{\\mathrm{add}}$ is incorrect. The result $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx 2s$ would arise if the heterozygote advantage was $s$ (e.g., $w_{Aa}=1+s$), but for the given additive case ($h=1/2$), the advantage is $s/2$ and the correct fixation probability is $2(s/2) = s$. The expression for $u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ is an oversimplification; while much smaller than $u_{\\mathrm{add}}$, it is non-zero and has a specific functional form.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx s$, $u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2N_e}$, and $u_{\\mathrm{add}}/u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx s N_e$.**\n    This statement correctly gives $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx s$, but it incorrectly claims $u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ is equal to the neutral fixation probability $1/(2N_e)$. Our derivation shows that $u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ is greater than the neutral probability by a factor of $\\sqrt{8 N_e s / \\pi}$. The ratio is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. $u_{\\mathrm{add}} \\approx \\dfrac{s}{2}$, $u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx s^2$, and $u_{\\mathrm{add}}/u_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2s}$.**\n    All three parts of this statement are incorrect. The expression for $u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ lacks the necessary dependence on $N_e$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only correct statement is A. The large ratio $u_{\\mathrm{add}}/u_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ demonstrates Haldane's sieve: selection is much less efficient at fixing beneficial recessive alleles compared to alleles with some degree of dominance, because the recessive allele is shielded from selection when rare and existing only in heterozygotes.",
