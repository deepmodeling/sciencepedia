This exercise  challenges you to mathematically model a well-known source of mutational heterogeneity: the elevated rate of $C \\to T$ transitions at CpG dinucleotides due to methylation.

            "problem": "In a large outbreeding population of a eukaryote with Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), consider the generation of de novo point mutations from cytosine to thymine. Assume that cytosine followed by guanine in the 5' to 3' direction (CpG dinucleotide context) experiences a methylation-associated elevation in the per-site, per-generation mutation rate from cytosine to thymine relative to non-CpG cytosines. Let the total number of cytosines in the genome be $N_{C}$, and let a fraction $f_{\\text{CpG}}$ of these cytosines occur in CpG context. Assume mutations arise as independent rare events across sites within a generation, so that the expected number of events is the sum of per-site rates over sites, and observed counts are proportional to expectations under a Poisson process model. Let $r_{m}$ denote the per-site, per-generation cytosine-to-thymine rate at CpG cytosines (assumed methylated) and $r_{b}$ the per-site, per-generation cytosine-to-thymine rate at non-CpG cytosines (baseline).\n\nUsing only the definitions of per-site mutation rate, the law of total expectation over site classes, and the rare-event approximation for independent sites, derive from first principles an expression for the expected fraction $F$ of de novo cytosine-to-thymine mutations that arise at CpG sites in a single generation, expressed in terms of $f_{\\text{CpG}}$, $r_{m}$, and $r_{b}$.\n\nThen evaluate $F$ under the following empirically motivated parameter values: $f_{\\text{CpG}} = 0.02$, $r_{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-7}$ per site per generation, and $r_{b} = 1 \\times 10^{-8}$ per site per generation.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of molecular evolution, specifically mutation rate heterogeneity, and uses standard mathematical modeling assumptions for calculating expected outcomes. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected fraction, $F$, of de novo cytosine-to-thymine (C→T) mutations that occur at CpG sites. We begin by defining the quantities involved based on the problem statement.\n\nLet $N_C$ be the total number of cytosine nucleotides in the genome.\nThe set of all cytosines can be partitioned into two disjoint classes: those that are part of a CpG dinucleotide context, and those that are not.\n\nThe number of cytosines in CpG context is given by:\n$$N_{\\text{CpG}} = f_{\\text{CpG}} N_C$$\nwhere $f_{\\text{CpG}}$ is the fraction of cytosines in this context.\n\nThe number of cytosines in a non-CpG context is therefore:\n$$N_{\\text{non-CpG}} = (1 - f_{\\text{CpG}}) N_C$$\n\nThe problem defines two distinct per-site, per-generation mutation rates for C→T transitions:\n$r_m$: the rate at CpG sites.\n$r_b$: the rate at non-CpG sites (baseline).\n\nUnder the assumption that mutations are rare, independent events, the expected number of mutations in a given class of sites is the product of the number of sites in that class and the per-site mutation rate.\n\nThe expected number of C→T mutations arising from CpG sites in a single generation, $E[M_{\\text{CpG}}]$, is:\n$$E[M_{\\text{CpG}}] = N_{\\text{CpG}} \\cdot r_m = (f_{\\text{CpG}} N_C) r_m$$\n\nSimilarly, the expected number of C→T mutations arising from non-CpG sites, $E[M_{\\text{non-CpG}}]$, is:\n$$E[M_{\\text{non-CpG}}] = N_{\\text{non-CpG}} \\cdot r_b = ((1 - f_{\\text{CpG}}) N_C) r_b$$\n\nAccording to the law of total expectation, the total expected number of de novo C→T mutations per generation, $E[M_{\\text{total}}]$, is the sum of the expected numbers from these two disjoint classes of sites:\n$$E[M_{\\text{total}}] = E[M_{\\text{CpG}}] + E[M_{\\text{non-CpG}}]$$\n$$E[M_{\\text{total}}] = (f_{\\text{CpG}} N_C) r_m + ((1 - f_{\\text{CpG}}) N_C) r_b$$\nFactoring out the total number of cytosines, $N_C$:\n$$E[M_{\\text{total}}] = N_C (f_{\\text{CpG}} r_m + (1 - f_{\\text{CpG}}) r_b)$$\n\nThe desired quantity, $F$, is the expected fraction of total C→T mutations that arise at CpG sites. This is the ratio of the expected number of mutations at CpG sites to the total expected number of C→T mutations:\n$$F = \\frac{E[M_{\\text{CpG}}]}{E[M_{\\text{total}}]}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$F = \\frac{(f_{\\text{CpG}} N_C) r_m}{N_C (f_{\\text{CpG}} r_m + (1 - f_{\\text{CpG}}) r_b)}$$\nThe term $N_C$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, which is logical as the fraction should be independent of the genome size.

            "problem": "In a recombining genome where recombination hotspots are specified by short DNA sequence motifs, consider the following mechanistic picture motivated by the hotspot paradox. When a motif creates a hotspot, recombination events concentrated at that hotspot induce Biased Gene Conversion (BGC), which replaces the hotspot motif with its non-hotspot variants, thereby eroding the hotspot over time. New hotspot motifs arise de novo via mutation at some low rate, independently across genomic positions, and hotspots do not overlap at a given position. Assume the following:\n\n- Each genomic position can be in one of two states: non-hotspot ($0$) or hotspot ($1$).\n- Transitions $0 \\to 1$ occur with a constant de novo hotspot motif creation rate $\\mu_{h}$ per position, reflecting mutational origin.\n- Transitions $1 \\to 0$ occur with a constant hotspot erosion rate $\\alpha$ per position, reflecting BGC-induced motif loss.\n- Transitions occur as a memoryless continuous-time process with time-homogeneous rates, and there are no other transitions or states.\n\nTreat the dynamics at a single genomic position as a two-state Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC), and define the random variable $T$ to be the lifetime of a hotspot at that position, measured from the instant a hotspot is created at that position (that is, a transition $0 \\to 1$ occurs) until the instant it is next lost (the first transition $1 \\to 0$). Starting strictly from the definitions of transition rates and the infinitesimal form of a time-homogeneous CTMC, derive the survival function $S(t) = \\Pr(T \\ge t)$ and the corresponding probability density function $f(t)$ of $T$ under this birth–death process, explicitly justifying why de novo creation events during the lifetime do not alter $T$. Then compute the mean hotspot lifetime $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ in closed form.\n\nExpress the final answer for the mean hotspot lifetime as a single analytic expression in terms of $\\alpha$. No rounding is required. No units are required because $t$ is measured in the same arbitrary time unit used to define $\\alpha$ and $\\mu_{h}$.",

Justification is required for why the rate $\\mu_h$ does not affect $T$.\n\nStep 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard and valid application of stochastic process theory (specifically, a two-state CTMC, also known as a birth-death process) to model a well-established concept in evolutionary genetics—the \"hotspot paradox,\" which involves mutation, recombination, and biased gene conversion. The model is a simplification, but it is scientifically sound and appropriate for a theoretical investigation.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It defines a complete two-state CTMC and asks for the distribution and mean of the waiting time (sojourn time) in one of the states. This is a classic, solvable problem in the theory of stochastic processes with a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and formal mathematical language.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is valid. It is a rigorous exercise in applying a standard mathematical model to a biological phenomenon.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nLet $X(t)$ denote the state of the genomic position at time $t$, where $X(t) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The problem describes a two-state Continuous-Time Markov Chain. The transition rates are given as $q_{01} = \\mu_h$ and $q_{10} = \\alpha$. The generator matrix $Q$ for this process is:\n$$\nQ = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu_h & \\mu_h \\\\ \\alpha & -\\alpha \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe random variable $T$ is the lifetime of a hotspot. This corresponds to the waiting time, or sojourn time, in state $1$. The process starts in state $1$ at time $t=0$ (or, more precisely, we condition on the event that the process has just entered state $1$), and $T$ is the time elapsed until the process first leaves state $1$.\n\nA fundamental property of a time-homogeneous CTMC is that the sojourn time in any state $i$ follows an exponential distribution. The rate parameter of this distribution is the total rate of exiting state $i$, which is given by $\\lambda_i = -q_{ii} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}$.\nFor the lifetime of a hotspot, we are interested in the sojourn time in state $1$. The total rate of exiting state $1$ is $\\lambda_1 = -q_{11} = q_{10} = \\alpha$. The process is memoryless, meaning the future evolution from a state depends only on the current state, not on the path taken to reach it. Therefore, the time until the next transition occurs, given that the process is in state $1$, depends only on the exit rate from state $1$. The rate $\\mu_h = q_{01}$ is the rate of exiting state $0$. It is irrelevant to the duration of time spent in state $1$. This explicitly justifies why the de novo creation rate $\\mu_h$ does not alter the hotspot lifetime $T$. The lifetime $T$ is determined solely by the mechanism of its own destruction, which occurs at rate $\\alpha$.\n\nWe now derive the survival function $S(t) = \\Pr(T \\ge t)$ from first principles. $S(t)$ is the probability that the system, having entered state $1$ at time $0$, remains in state $1$ for at least a duration $t$. Let us consider a small time interval $\\Delta t$. The probability of a transition from state $1$ to state $0$ during this interval is given by the infinitesimal transition probability:\n$$\n\\Pr(X(t+\\Delta t)=0 | X(t)=1) = \\alpha \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)\n$$\nThe probability of remaining in state $1$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\Pr(X(t+\\Delta t)=1 | X(t)=1) = 1 - \\alpha \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)\n$$\nThe survival function $S(t) = \\Pr(\\text{no transition out of state 1 in } [0, t])$. Using the time-homogeneous and memoryless properties of the Markov chain:\n$$\nS(t+\\Delta t) = \\Pr(\\text{no transition in } [0, t+\\Delta t]) = \\Pr(\\text{no transition in } [0, t]) \\times \\Pr(\\text{no transition in } (t, t+\\Delta t] | \\text{no transition in } [0, t])\n$$\n$$\nS(t+\\Delta t) = S(t) \\times (1 - \\alpha \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t))\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{S(t+\\Delta t) - S(t)}{\\Delta t} = - \\alpha S(t) + \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, we obtain the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = - \\alpha S(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The initial condition is $S(0) = \\Pr(T \\ge 0) = 1$, as the lifetime must be non-negative. The solution to this ODE with the given initial condition is:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0\n$$\nThis is the survival function for the hotspot lifetime $T$.\n\nNext, we derive the probability density function (PDF), $f(t)$. The PDF is related to the survival function $S(t)$ and the cumulative distribution function $F(t) = \\Pr(T \\le t) = 1 - S(t)$ by the relation $f(t) = \\frac{dF(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$.\n$$\nf(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} (\\exp(-\\alpha t)) = -(-\\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha t)) = \\alpha \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0\n$$\nThis confirms that $T$ follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\alpha$, denoted $T \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\alpha)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the mean hotspot lifetime, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. For a non-negative random variable, the expectation can be computed by integrating the survival function over its support:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S(t) dt\n$$\nSubstituting the derived survival function:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\alpha t) dt\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(0) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ (a rate must be non-negative, and if $\\alpha=0$ the hotspot is never lost, leading to an infinite lifetime), the limit term goes to zero:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = 0 - \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe mean lifetime of a hotspot is the reciprocal of its erosion rate.",

A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is expressed in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nLet $M$ be the event that a true *de novo* mutation has occurred in the offspring. From the problem statement, the prior probability is $P(M) = \\mu$. The complementary event, $\\neg M$, that no mutation occurred, has probability $P(\\neg M) = 1 - \\mu$.\n\nThe calling rule defines an event $C$. Let $k_O$, $k_{P1}$, and $k_{P2}$ be the number of alternate allele reads for the offspring, parent 1, and parent 2, respectively, each out of a total of $d$ reads. The event $C$ is formally defined as:\n$$C \\iff (k_O \\geq 1) \\land (k_{P1} = 0) \\land (k_{P2} = 0)$$\n\nThe number of alternate reads for any individual follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(d, p)$, where $p$ is the probability that a single read reports the alternate allele. This probability $p$ depends on the individual's true genotype.\n\nIf an individual is homozygous for the reference allele (Ref/Ref), an alternate read can only be observed due to a sequencing error. The probability of sampling the reference allele is $1$, and the probability of it being incorrectly reported as alternate is $e$. Thus, for a Ref/Ref individual:\n$$p_{\\text{Ref/Ref}} = e$$\nThe parents are from a monomorphic reference population, so they are Ref/Ref. If no mutation occurs ($\\neg M$), the offspring is also Ref/Ref.\n\nIf an individual is heterozygous (Ref/Alt), which is the case for the offspring if event $M$ occurs, a read can be alternate in two ways: by correctly reading the alternate allele or by incorrectly reading the reference allele. A single read samples the alternate chromosome with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the reference chromosome with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability of a read being alternate is:\n$$p_{\\text{Het}} = P(\\text{read is Alt} | \\text{sampled Alt})P(\\text{sampled Alt}) + P(\\text{read is Alt} | \\text{sampled Ref})P(\\text{sampled Ref})$$\n$$p_{\\text{Het}} = (1-e)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (e)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1-e+e}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSo, for a heterozygous individual, the number of alternate reads is distributed as $k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(d, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\n**1. Detection Power**\n\nThe detection power is the probability of calling a mutation, given that one has truly occurred. This is $P(C|M)$. Since the sequencing of each individual is an independent process, we have:\n$$P(C|M) = P(k_O \\geq 1 | M) \\times P(k_{P1} = 0 | M) \\times P(k_{P2} = 0 | M)$$\nFor the offspring, given event $M$, the genotype is Het. Thus, $k_O \\sim \\text{Binomial}(d, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n$$P(k_O \\geq 1 | M) = 1 - P(k_O = 0 | M) = 1 - \\binom{d}{0}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{d} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^d = 1 - 2^{-d}$$\nThe parents are Ref/Ref. Thus, $k_{P1}, k_{P2} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(d, e)$.\n$$P(k_{P1} = 0 | M) = \\binom{d}{0}e^0(1-e)^{d} = (1-e)^d$$\n$$P(k_{P2} = 0 | M) = (1-e)^d$$\nCombining these results, the detection power is:\n$$\\text{Power} = P(C|M) = (1 - 2^{-d})(1-e)^{2d}$$\n\n**2. False Discovery Rate (FDR)**\n\nThe FDR is the posterior probability that a call is false, given that the calling rule was triggered. This is $P(\\neg M | C)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\\text{FDR} = P(\\neg M | C) = \\frac{P(C|\\neg M)P(\\neg M)}{P(C)}$$\nThe total probability of a call, $P(C)$, is given by the law of total probability:\n$$P(C) = P(C|M)P(M) + P(C|\\neg M)P(\\neg M)$$\nWe need to calculate $P(C|\\neg M)$. If no mutation occurred ($\\neg M$), the offspring is Ref/Ref, just like the parents. All three individuals are Ref/Ref, and their read counts $k_O, k_{P1}, k_{P2}$ are independent and identically distributed as $\\text{Binomial}(d, e)$.\n$$P(C|\\neg M) = P(k_O \\geq 1 | \\neg M) \\times P(k_{P1} = 0 | \\neg M) \\times P(k_{P2} = 0 | \\neg M)$$\nFor the offspring (now Ref/Ref):\n$$P(k_O \\geq 1 | \\neg M) = 1 - P(k_O = 0 | \\neg M) = 1 - \\binom{d}{0}e^0(1-e)^d = 1 - (1-e)^d$$\nFor the parents (Ref/Ref):\n$$P(k_{P1} = 0 | \\neg M) = (1-e)^d$$\n$$P(k_{P2} = 0 | \\neg M) = (1-e)^d$$\nThus, the probability of a false call is:\n$$P(C|\\neg M) = (1 - (1-e)^d)(1-e)^{2d}$$\nNow we substitute all the components into the FDR formula:\n$$\\text{FDR} = \\frac{P(C|\\neg M)P(\\neg M)}{P(C|M)P(M) + P(C|\\neg M)P(\\neg M)}$$\n$$\\text{FDR} = \\frac{\\left[(1 - (1-e)^d)(1-e)^{2d}\\right](1-\\mu)}{\\left[(1 - 2^{-d})(1-e)^{2d}\\right]\\mu + \\left[(1 - (1-e)^d)(1-e)^{2d}\\right](1-\\mu)}$$\nAssuming $e < 1$, the term $(1-e)^{2d}$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\text{FDR} = \\frac{(1 - (1-e)^d)(1-\\mu)}{(1 - 2^{-d})\\mu + (1 - (1-e)^d)(1-\\mu)}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the False Discovery Rate as a function of $d$, $e$, and $\\mu$.",
