This involves identifying the system's equilibria—the allele frequencies at which evolution halts—and determining their stability. In this foundational exercise , you will use linear stability analysis, a cornerstone technique in mathematical biology, to formally characterize the behavior of the system near its three fixed points. This analysis will rigorously demonstrate why the fixation states are stable attractors, while the internal polymorphic equilibrium is an unstable repellor, acting as a critical tipping point.",

After selection, the frequencies of the genotypes are proportional to $p^2 w_{11}$, $2pq w_{12}$, and $q^2 w_{22}$. To obtain the normalized frequencies of the surviving adults, we divide by the mean fitness of the population, $\\bar{w}$.\n\nThe mean fitness $\\bar{w}$ is the sum of the fitness-weighted genotype frequencies:\n$$\n\\bar{w} = p^2 w_{11} + 2p(1-p) w_{12} + (1-p)^2 w_{22}\n$$\nThe frequency of allele $A$ in the next generation, $p'$, is the frequency of $AA$ individuals plus half the frequency of $Aa$ individuals among the survivors.\n$$\np' = f(p) = \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + \\frac{1}{2}(2p(1-p) w_{12})}{\\bar{w}} = \\frac{p^2 w_{11} + p(1-p) w_{12}}{p^2 w_{11} + 2p(1-p) w_{12} + (1-p)^2 w_{22}}\n$$\nThis is the required one-generation allele-frequency recurrence relation.

Viability selection acts on genotypes at a single locus with two alleles, denoted by $A$ and $a$. Let $p_t$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in generation $t$. The life cycle is: random mating, zygote formation in Hardy–Weinberg proportions, and genotype-specific viability selection. Under viability selection, the standard allele-frequency recursion is\n$$\np_{t+1} \\;=\\; \\frac{p_t \\, w_A(p_t)}{\\overline{w}(p_t)},\n$$\nwhere $w_A(p)$ is the marginal fitness of allele $A$ and $\\overline{w}(p)$ is the mean fitness at allele frequency $p$.

            "solution": "The problem describes a deterministic dynamical system governing the evolution of an allele frequency, $p_t$, in a population. The state of the system at any discrete time $t$ is the value of $p_t$, which is constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. The evolution is given by the recursion $p_{t+1} = f(p_t)$, where $f(p) = \\frac{p \\, w_A(p)}{\\overline{w}(p)}$.\n\nThe problem specifies the qualitative structure of the dynamics under heterozygote disadvantage (underdominance). There are three equilibria, which are the fixed points of the recursion, satisfying $p = f(p)$. These are given as $p=0$, $p=1$, and $p^{*} = 0.37$. The equilibria at $p=0$ and $p=1$ are described as locally attracting (stable), while the internal equilibrium at $p^{*} = 0.37$ is unstable.\n\nIn a one-dimensional dynamical system such as this, an unstable equilibrium point serves as a separatrix, partitioning the state space into basins of attraction for the stable equilibria. The basin of attraction for a stable equilibrium is defined as the set of all initial states from which the system's trajectory converges to that equilibrium.\n\nGiven the stability properties of the equilibria:\n1.  A trajectory starting from an initial allele frequency $p_{init} \\in [0, p^{*})$ will evolve such that $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} p_t = 0$. The unstable point $p^{*}$ repels nearby trajectories on its left towards $0$.\n2.  A trajectory starting from an initial allele frequency $p_{init} \\in (p^{*}, 1]$ will evolve such that $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} p_t = 1$. The unstable point $p^{*}$ repels nearby trajectories on its right towards $1$.\n3.  A trajectory starting exactly at $p_{init} = p^{*}$ will remain there, i.e., $p_t = p^{*}$ for all $t  0$.\n\nTherefore, the basin of attraction for the equilibrium at $p=0$ is the interval $[0, p^{*})$. The basin of attraction for the equilibrium at $p=1$ is the interval $(p^{*}, 1]$.\n\nThe initial state of the population is given as $p_0 = 0$. At time $t=0$, a perturbation of magnitude $\\Delta$ is applied, where $0 \\le \\Delta \\le 1$. The new, post-perturbation frequency is $p_0^{+} = p_0 + \\Delta$. Substituting the initial condition, we have $p_0^{+} = 0 + \\Delta = \\Delta$.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the condition on $\\Delta$ such that the subsequent trajectory converges to the equilibrium at $p=1$. This means that the post-perturbation frequency, $p_0^{+}$, must lie within the basin of attraction of $p=1$.\nMathematically, this condition is:\n$$p_0^{+} \\in (p^{*}, 1]$$\n\nSubstituting $p_0^{+} = \\Delta$ and the given value $p^{*} = 0.37$, we obtain the condition on $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta \\in (0.37, 1]$$\n\nThe question asks for the infimum of the perturbation magnitude, $|\\Delta|$, that satisfies this condition. Since the problem states $0 \\le \\Delta \\le 1$, the magnitude $|\\Delta|$ is equal to $\\Delta$. We need to find the infimum of the set of all possible values for $\\Delta$ that ensure convergence to $p=1$. This set is $S = (0.37, 1]$.\n\nThe infimum of a set is its greatest lower bound. For the interval $(0.37, 1]$, the lower bounds are all real numbers less than or equal to $0.37$. The greatest of these lower bounds is $0.37$.\nTherefore, the infimum of the set $S$ is:\n$$\\inf(S) = \\inf((0.37, 1]) = 0.37$$\n\nThis result signifies that any perturbation $\\Delta$ strictly greater than $0.37$ will shift the allele frequency into the basin of attraction of $p=1$, leading to fixation of allele $A$. A perturbation of exactly $\\Delta = 0.37$ would place the system at the unstable equilibrium, and any perturbation smaller than this would result in the system returning to the initial state of $p=0$. The smallest value that can be approached to achieve the desired outcome is $0.37$.",
