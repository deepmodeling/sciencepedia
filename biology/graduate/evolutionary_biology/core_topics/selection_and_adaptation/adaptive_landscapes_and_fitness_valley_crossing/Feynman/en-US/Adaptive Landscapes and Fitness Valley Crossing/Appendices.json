            "problem": "In a large asexual haploid population evolving in a constant environment, the absolute fitness $w_{ij}$ of genotype $ij$ at two biallelic loci $i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is measured experimentally as the expected number of surviving offspring per discrete generation. Treat $w_{00}$ as the reference genotype. The empirically measured absolute fitnesses are $w_{00} = 1.000$, $w_{10} = 0.900$, $w_{01} = 0.900$, and $w_{11} = 0.805$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and well-tested facts about absolute fitness, Malthusian fitness (log fitness), and epistasis as a deviation from an appropriate no-interaction null model, do the following:\n\n1. Starting from the definition of epistasis as a deviation from a no-interaction null model on a given measurement scale, derive the algebraic form of the epistasis coefficient on the absolute fitness scale and on the log fitness scale, making explicit how the choice of scale changes the null model.\n2. Compute the sign and magnitude of epistasis on the absolute fitness scale and on the log fitness scale for the given data.

Do not include any units or symbols in the final reported value.",
            "solution": "We begin by stating fundamental definitions. Absolute fitness $w$ is the expected number of surviving offspring per discrete generation for a given genotype under a fixed environment. The Malthusian fitness (log fitness) $m$ is defined as $m = \\ln w$, which in continuous-time models corresponds to the per-capita instantaneous growth rate. Epistasis is defined as a deviation from a no-interaction null model built from single-locus effects measured on a chosen scale; the definition requires specifying additivity on that scale. On an additive scale, the two-locus effect without interaction equals the sum of single-locus effects relative to a reference. On a multiplicative scale, the two-locus effect without interaction equals the product of single-locus effects; additivity in the logarithm corresponds to multiplicativity on the original scale.\n\nAbsolute scale null model and epistasis. On the absolute fitness scale, adopt a linear model relative to a reference genotype $00$ with absolute fitness $w_{00}$. The single-locus effects are the differences $w_{10} - w_{00}$ and $w_{01} - w_{00}$. Under a no-interaction null model on this additive scale, the expected double-mutant absolute fitness is\n$$\nw_{11}^{\\mathrm{null,abs}} = w_{00} + \\left(w_{10} - w_{00}\\right) + \\left(w_{01} - w_{00}\\right) = -w_{00} + w_{10} + w_{01}.\n$$\nThe absolute-scale epistasis coefficient is the observed minus the null expectation,\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{abs}} = w_{11} - w_{11}^{\\mathrm{null,abs}} = w_{11} - \\left(-w_{00} + w_{10} + w_{01}\\right) = w_{11} - w_{10} - w_{01} + w_{00}.\n$$\n\nLog scale null model and epistasis. On the log fitness scale, let $m_{ij} = \\ln w_{ij}$. Under a no-interaction null model on the additive log scale, the expected double-mutant log fitness is\n$$\nm_{11}^{\\mathrm{null,log}} = m_{00} + \\left(m_{10} - m_{00}\\right) + \\left(m_{01} - m_{00}\\right) = -m_{00} + m_{10} + m_{01}.\n$$\nThe log-scale epistasis coefficient is\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}} = m_{11} - m_{11}^{\\mathrm{null,log}} = m_{11} - m_{10} - m_{01} + m_{00}.\n$$\nEquivalently, in terms of absolute fitness,\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}} = \\ln w_{11} - \\ln w_{10} - \\ln w_{01} + \\ln w_{00} = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{w_{11}\\,w_{00}}{w_{10}\\,w_{01}}\\right).\n$$\nThus the two null models differ: additivity on the absolute scale versus additivity of $\\ln w$ on the log scale, which corresponds to multiplicativity on the absolute scale.\n\nApply to the given data $w_{00} = 1.000$, $w_{10} = 0.900$, $w_{01} = 0.900$, $w_{11} = 0.805$.\n\nCompute absolute-scale epistasis:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{abs}} = w_{11} - w_{10} - w_{01} + w_{00} = 0.805 - 0.900 - 0.900 + 1.000 = 0.005.\n$$\nBecause the single mutants are deleterious relative to $w_{00}$, a positive $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ indicates antagonistic epistasis (the double mutant is less deleterious than expected under additivity on the absolute scale).\n\nCompute log-scale epistasis. First, compute the ratio inside the logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{w_{11}\\,w_{00}}{w_{10}\\,w_{01}} = \\frac{0.805 \\times 1.000}{0.900 \\times 0.900} = \\frac{0.805}{0.810} = \\frac{161}{162}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}} = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{161}{162}\\right).\n$$\nSince $\\frac{161}{162} < 1$, we have $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}} < 0$. Numerically,\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}} \\approx \\ln(0.9938271605) \\approx -0.006191970\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is $-0.006192$. For deleterious single mutants, a negative $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}}$ indicates synergistic epistasis (the double mutant is more deleterious than expected under additivity on the log scale, i.e., under multiplicativity on the absolute scale).\n\nClassification change with scale. On the absolute scale, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{abs}} = 0.005 > 0$ (antagonistic). On the log scale, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}} \\approx -0.006192 < 0$ (synergistic). Thus, the classification changes with the choice of scale. The reason is that the two null models order the expected double-mutant fitness differently: here $-w_{00} + w_{10} + w_{01} = 0.800$ is less than $w_{10} w_{01} / w_{00} = 0.810$, and $w_{11} = 0.805$ lies between these two expectations.\n\nWhich scale is more appropriate for selection? From first principles, in continuous time the change in genotype frequency $p$ satisfies $\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}t = p\\,(m - \\bar{m})$, where $m = \\ln w$ is the Malthusian fitness and $\\bar{m}$ is the mean Malthusian fitness; thus selection acts on differences in $m$ that add across independent effects. In discrete generations with multiplicative life-cycle components (viability, fecundity), relative fitnesses multiply across components, and additivity in $\\ln w$ again captures independence of effects. Therefore, when empirical $w$ are per-generation absolute fitnesses derived from multiplicative demographic processes, the log scale (Malthusian fitness) provides the appropriate no-interaction baseline for modeling selection and epistasis in adaptive landscapes. Consequently, the log-scale epistasis $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}}$ is the scale-consistent quantity to report for selection-centered analyses.\n\nFinally, per the instructions, the reported quantity is the unitless $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{log}}$ rounded to four significant figures, which is $-0.006192$.",

Rate of Sequential Fixation ($R_{seq}$)**\n\nThe sequential fixation pathway consists of two distinct substitution events:\n1. The deleterious single mutant arises and, against selection, drifts to fixation.\n2. From the now-monomorphic population of single mutants, the advantageous double mutant arises and sweeps to fixation.\n\nThe rate of this entire process is limited by the rate of the first, much slower step: the fixation of the deleterious intermediate.

Rate of Stochastic Tunneling ($R_{tun}$)**\n\nStochastic tunneling occurs when a double mutant arises from a lineage of single mutants while that lineage is still rare and has not fixed. This double mutant then drives the entire lineage to fixation.\n\nThe process is initiated by the appearance of a single mutant at rate $N\\mu$. This mutant, with relative fitness $1-s$, founds a deleterious lineage. We model the fate of this lineage using a continuous-time subcritical branching process. The expected number of individuals in this lineage at time $t$ is $\\exp(-st)$.
