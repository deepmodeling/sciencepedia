            "introduction": "This first exercise explores the classic scenario of mutation-selection balance for a completely recessive and lethal allele. It's a fundamental case that illustrates how a deleterious allele can persist in a population by \"hiding\" from negative selection in heterozygous carriers. By solving this, you will calculate the predictable equilibrium frequency, $\\hat{q}$, that arises when the constant introduction of new copies by mutation is balanced by the removal of the allele in homozygous individuals .",

A new spontaneous mutation is identified that results in a condition termed \"Fragmented Wing Syndrome\". The allele responsible, designated `fw`, is found to be completely recessive to the wild-type allele, `FW`. Individuals homozygous for the `fw` allele (`fw`/`fw`) fail to develop complete wings and are non-viable, dying shortly after eclosion. Through careful molecular analysis, the rate of forward mutation from the `FW` allele to the `fw` allele is determined to be $\\mu = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ per generation. Assuming the population has been maintained long enough to reach a stable mutation-selection balance, calculate the expected equilibrium frequency of the lethal `fw` allele.\n\nProvide your answer as a real number rounded to three significant figures.",

Under random mating, genotype frequencies before selection are Hardy–Weinberg proportions: $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$. Because $fw/fw$ is lethal, assign fitnesses $W_{FW/FW}=1$, $W_{FW/fw}=1$, and $W_{fw/fw}=1-s$ with $s=1$.

            "introduction": "Building upon the previous example, this practice investigates the crucial role of the dominance coefficient, $h$. It directly contrasts the fate of a fully recessive allele with one that has a minor deleterious effect in heterozygotes, a situation that is common in nature. This comparison powerfully demonstrates how even a slight \"exposure\" of the allele to selection drastically changes its equilibrium frequency, highlighting the efficiency of selection against traits that are not completely recessive .",

            "problem": "In a large, randomly mating population of a hypothetical beetle species, a rare genetic disorder known as Chitin Synthesis Deficiency (CSD) is maintained by a balance between mutation and natural selection. The disorder is controlled by a single gene with two alleles: a dominant wild-type allele, $B$, and a recessive allele, $b$, which causes CSD. The forward mutation rate from allele $B$ to allele $b$ is $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ per generation. Individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype ($bb$) cannot produce a functional exoskeleton and are therefore non-viable, dying before they can reproduce.\n\nFirst, calculate the equilibrium frequency of the deleterious allele $b$, assuming it is completely recessive and has no effect on the phenotype or fitness of heterozygotes ($Bb$).\n\nNext, suppose further investigation reveals that the allele $b$ is not completely recessive. While heterozygotes survive, they exhibit a subtle structural weakness in their exoskeletons that reduces their overall fitness. This effect is quantified by a dominance coefficient $h=0.05$. The selection coefficient against the lethal homozygous recessive genotype ($bb$) remains $s=1$. Calculate the new equilibrium frequency of the allele $b$ under this condition of partial dominance.\n\nProvide both calculated equilibrium frequencies, for the completely recessive case and the partially dominant case respectively, rounded to three significant figures.

            "solution": "Let the frequency of the deleterious allele be $q$ and the wild-type allele be $p$, with $p=1-q$. The forward mutation rate from $B$ to $b$ is $\\mu$, and we neglect back mutation. Genotype fitnesses under selection are taken as $w_{BB}=1$, $w_{Bb}=1-hs$, and $w_{bb}=1-s$, with $s$ the selection coefficient and $h$ the dominance coefficient.\n\nAt mutation–selection balance, the per-generation gain of $b$ alleles by mutation equals the per-generation loss by selection, so $\\Delta q=\\Delta q_{\\text{mut}}+\\Delta q_{\\text{sel}}=0$.\n\nCompletely recessive case ($h=0$):\n- When $h=0$, selection acts only on homozygous recessives. For rare $b$ ($q\\ll 1$), the fraction of individuals that are $bb$ is approximately $q^{2}$, mean fitness is approximately $1$, and the loss of $b$ alleles due to selection is approximately $s q^{2}$.

            "introduction": "We now turn our attention to the opposite end of the dominance spectrum: a deleterious allele that is dominant. Unlike a recessive allele, a dominant one is always visible to natural selection, as it affects the phenotype of every individual who carries it, whether they are heterozygous or homozygous. This exercise will allow you to calculate the equilibrium frequency in this scenario, revealing why pathogenic dominant mutations are typically maintained at very low levels in a population .",

            "problem": "In a large, randomly-mating population of wild marmots, a newly discovered gene called *Densitin* influences bone structure. The gene has two alleles: a common wild-type allele, *d*, and a rare, dominant mutant allele, *D'*. Individuals carrying at least one copy of the *D'* allele develop hyper-dense but unusually brittle bones. This condition increases their susceptibility to life-threatening fractures during normal activities like burrowing and foraging.\n\nPopulation studies have quantified the evolutionary impact of this allele. The lifetime reproductive success of marmots with the *D'/d* or *D'/D'* genotype is, on average, 40% lower than that of wild-type (*d/d*) individuals. This reduction in fitness is represented by a selection coefficient, $s$. Furthermore, spontaneous mutations from the wild-type *d* allele to the mutant *D'* allele occur at a rate of $\\mu = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$ new mutations per allele, per generation. The rate of back-mutation from *D'* to *d* is considered negligible.\n\nAfter a vast number of generations, the population is expected to reach a mutation-selection balance, where the introduction of new *D'* alleles by mutation is exactly offset by their removal due to natural selection. Calculate the expected equilibrium frequency of the deleterious *D'* allele in this marmot population. Round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium frequency of a dominant deleterious allele, *D'*, in a population where its presence is maintained by mutation but opposed by natural selection. We can find this frequency by setting the rate of introduction of the allele by mutation equal to the rate of its removal by selection.\n\nLet $q$ be the frequency of the dominant mutant allele *D'*, and $p$ be the frequency of the recessive wild-type allele *d*. By definition, $p + q = 1$.\n\n**Step 1: Quantify the rate of introduction of the *D'* allele by mutation.**\nNew *D'* alleles are created when *d* alleles mutate. The rate of this mutation is given as $\\mu = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$. The increase in the frequency of *D'* in one generation due to mutation, $\\Delta q_{\\text{mutation}}$, is the mutation rate multiplied by the frequency of the source allele, *d*.\n$$ \\Delta q_{\\text{mutation}} = \\mu p = \\mu (1-q) $$\n\n**Step 2: Quantify the rate of removal of the *D'* allele by selection.**\nThe allele *D'* is dominant, meaning selection acts against both the heterozygous (*D'/d*) and homozygous dominant (*D'/D'*) genotypes. The problem states that the reproductive success of these individuals is reduced by 40%, which gives a selection coefficient $s = 0.4$.\n\nThe change in allele frequency per generation due to selection, $\\Delta q_{\\text{selection}}$, can be approximated for a rare dominant allele. Since the allele is deleterious, its equilibrium frequency $q$ will be very small ($q \\ll 1$). Consequently, the vast majority of individuals carrying the *D'* allele will be heterozygotes (frequency $2pq$), and the frequency of homozygous mutants (frequency $q^2$) will be negligible. The loss of alleles is primarily from the selection against these heterozygotes. For a rare dominant allele, the rate of removal of the allele from the gene pool is well approximated by the product of the allele's frequency and the selection coefficient against it.\n$$ \\Delta q_{\\text{selection}} \\approx -s q $$\n\n**Step 3: Establish the equilibrium condition.**\nAt equilibrium, the frequency of the allele *D'* does not change from one generation to the next. This means the increase due to mutation must exactly balance the decrease due to selection. Let $\\hat{q}$ be the equilibrium frequency of the *D'* allele.\n$$ \\Delta q_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta q_{\\text{mutation}} + \\Delta q_{\\text{selection}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\mu (1-\\hat{q}) - s \\hat{q} = 0 $$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the equilibrium frequency, $\\hat{q}$.**\nWe can rearrange the equation from Step 3 to solve for $\\hat{q}$:\n$$ \\mu - \\mu \\hat{q} - s \\hat{q} = 0 $$\n$$ \\mu = \\hat{q}(\\mu + s) $$\n$$ \\hat{q} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu + s} $$\nSince the mutation rate $\\mu$ is typically many orders of magnitude smaller than the selection coefficient $s$, we can make a very good approximation that $\\mu + s \\approx s$. This also follows from our earlier approximation where we assumed $p = 1-\\hat{q} \\approx 1$ in the mutation term, which simplifies the balance equation directly to $\\mu - s \\hat{q} = 0$. Using this simplified and standard formula:\n$$ \\hat{q} \\approx \\frac{\\mu}{s} $$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the given values and calculate the final answer.**\nWe are given:\n- Mutation rate, $\\mu = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- Selection coefficient, $s = 0.4$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\hat{q} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.4} $$\n$$ \\hat{q} = \\frac{5}{4 \\times 10^{-1}} \\times 10^{-6} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-6 - (-1)} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ \\hat{q} = 1.250 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis is the expected equilibrium frequency of the *D'* allele.",
