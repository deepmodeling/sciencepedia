Let $p_i$ be the frequency of genotype $G_i$ and $W_i$ be its absolute fitness for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.

Based on the provided definition, $\\bar{W}$ is the expected value of fitness over the distribution of genotypes in the population. This is the frequency-weighted average of the absolute fitnesses of the genotypes.\n$$ \\bar{W} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i W_i = p_1 W_1 + p_2 W_2 + p_3 W_3 $$\nSubstituting the rational values:\n$$ \\bar{W} = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)(1) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) $$\n$$ \\bar{W} = \\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{7}{10} $$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $50$.\n$$ \\bar{W} = \\frac{6 \\times 2}{25 \\times 2} + \\frac{7 \\times 5}{10 \\times 5} = \\frac{12}{50} + \\frac{35}{50} = \\frac{47}{50} $$\nThis is the population mean absolute fitness.\n\nNext, we compute the relative fitness, $w_i$, for each genotype. The definition given is that relative fitness is the absolute fitness normalized by the population mean absolute fitness: $w_i = W_i / \\bar{W}$.\n\nFor genotype $G_1$:\n$$ w_1 = \\frac{W_1}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{6/5}{47/50} = \\frac{6}{5} \\times \\frac{50}{47} = \\frac{6 \\times 10}{47} = \\frac{60}{47} $$\n\nFor genotype $G_2$:\n$$ w_2 = \\frac{W_2}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{1}{47/50} = \\frac{50}{47} $$\n\nFor genotype $G_3$:\n$$ w_3 = \\frac{W_3}{\\bar{W}} = \\frac{4/5}{47/50} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{50}{47} = \\frac{4 \\times 10}{47} = \\frac{40}{47} $$\nThese are the relative fitnesses for the three genotypes.\n\nFinally, we compute the population mean relative fitness, $\\bar{w}$.

This serves as a validation of the preceding steps.\n\nThe required quantities have been computed. We assemble them into a single row vector in the specified order: $(w_1, w_2, w_3, \\bar{W}, \\bar{w})$.\nThe values are: $\\frac{60}{47}$, $\\frac{50}{47}$, $\\frac{40}{47}$, $\\frac{47}{50}$, and $1$.",

This yields the fundamental relationship:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(z, w)}{\\bar{w}} $$\nThis is a specific form of the Price equation for a single generation of selection, also known as the Robertson-Price identity.\n\nUsing our previously calculated values:\n$$ S = \\frac{19/125}{27/25} = \\frac{19}{125} \\times \\frac{25}{27} = \\frac{19}{5 \\times 25} \\times \\frac{25}{27} = \\frac{19}{5 \\times 27} = \\frac{19}{135} $$\nThis completes the second part of the problem.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of evolutionary game theory and population genetics, specifically frequency-dependent selection.

Therefore, a complete solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a haploid population undergoing viability selection based on payoffs from a symmetric $2 \\times 2$ game. The primary objective is to demonstrate that mean population fitness can decrease across a generation despite the presence of positive additive genetic variance in fitness.\n\nFirst, we determine the expected payoffs, $\\pi_i(\\mathbf p)$, for each strategy, cooperation ($C$) and defection ($D$), as a function of the frequency of cooperators, $p_C$. The population is randomly mating, so an individual of a given strategy interacts with a cooperator with probability $p_C$ and with a defector with probability $p_D = 1 - p_C$. The payoff matrix is given as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0\\\\\n5 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe entries represent the payoff to the row strategy when interacting with the column strategy.\n\nThe expected payoff for a cooperator is:\n$$\n\\pi_C(\\mathbf p) = p_C \\cdot \\pi(C,C) + (1-p_C) \\cdot \\pi(C,D) = p_C \\cdot 3 + (1-p_C) \\cdot 0 = 3p_C\n$$\nThe expected payoff for a defector is:\n$$\n\\pi_D(\\mathbf p) = p_C \\cdot \\pi(D,C) + (1-p_C) \\cdot \\pi(D,D) = p_C \\cdot 5 + (1-p_C) \\cdot 1 = 5p_C + 1 - p_C = 4p_C + 1\n$$\nThe absolute fitness $w_i$ of a strategy $i$ is given by $w_i = 1 + \\pi_i(\\mathbf p)$.

For a haploid population with two strategies, this is the variance of the fitness values $w_C$ and $w_D$, which occur with frequencies $p_C$ and $p_D$:\n$$\nV_A(w) = p_C p_D (w_C - w_D)^2\n$$\nUsing the values from the parental generation:\n$$\nw_C - w_D = \\frac{17}{5} - \\frac{26}{5} = -\\frac{9}{5}\n$$\n$$\nV_A(w) = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{9}{5}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{25}\\right)\\left(\\frac{81}{25}\\right) = \\frac{324}{625} = 0.5184\n$$\nThe additive genetic variance in fitness is positive, $V_A(w) > 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the change in mean fitness from the parental to the offspring generation, $\\Delta \\bar w = \\bar w(\\mathbf p') - \\bar w(\\mathbf p)$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar w = \\frac{8056}{2209} - \\frac{94}{25} = \\frac{8056 \\cdot 25 - 94 \\cdot 2209}{2209 \\cdot 25} = \\frac{201400 - 207646}{55225} = -\\frac{6246}{55225}\n$$\nConverting this to a numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar w \\approx -0.1130999... \\approx -0.1131\n$$\nThe calculation demonstrates that $\\Delta \\bar w < 0$. This occurs because selection favors defectors ($w_D > w_C$), increasing their frequency ($p_D' > p_D$). However, an increase in the frequency of defectors degrades the fitness environment for all individuals in the next generation, as payoffs from interactions are generally lower when defectors are more common (in this case, $\\pi(C,D) < \\pi(C,C)$ and $\\pi(D,D) < \\pi(D,C)$). This environmental degradation effect is strong enough to overcome the increase in mean fitness expected from selection within the parent generation (the Fisherian component), leading to an overall decrease in mean population fitness. This is a classic result showing the limits of Fisher's fundamental theorem under frequency-dependent selection.",
