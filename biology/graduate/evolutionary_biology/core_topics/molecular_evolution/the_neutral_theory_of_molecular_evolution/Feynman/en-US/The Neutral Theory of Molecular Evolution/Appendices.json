A direct comparison reveals that there are 36 nucleotide differences between them. Geological analysis of volcanic rock layers on the islands suggests that the ancestral population was split, leading to the divergence of the two species, approximately 6.0 million years ago.\n\nAssuming the neutral theory of molecular evolution holds for this pseudogene, calculate the average rate of neutral mutation.

            "problem": "A team of molecular evolutionists is studying a pair of recently duplicated genes in a plant genome. They hypothesize that the evolution of these genes is governed by the neutral theory, meaning that all mutations, both synonymous and non-synonymous, are selectively neutral with respect to the protein's function. However, they suspect that a known molecular drive mechanism, GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), is active. This process, associated with recombination, tends to favor the fixation of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) nucleotides over Adenine (A) and Thymine (T).\n\nTo quantify this effect, the team models the substitution process as follows. They classify bases as either 'Weak' (W), which are A or T, or 'Strong' (S), which are G or C. The baseline neutral substitution rate at any site, if no bias were present, is a constant $\\rho_0$. The gBGC process modifies this rate based on the type of mutation:\n- The effective substitution rate for a mutation that changes a W base to an S base is $B \\times \\rho_0$.\n- The effective substitution rate for a mutation that changes an S base to a W base is $\\frac{1}{B} \\times \\rho_0$.\n- The effective substitution rate for mutations that do not change the W/S status (i.e., W to W or S to S) remains at the baseline rate $\\rho_0$.\n\nThe team analyzes the gene's coding sequence and, based on the genetic code and the amino acid sequence, partitions the potential for mutations. They determine the following properties for one of the gene copies:\n- The total number of non-synonymous sites is $N_a = 700$.\n- The total number of synonymous sites is $N_s = 200$.\n\nThrough a careful site-by-site analysis, the non-synonymous sites are further categorized based on the type of mutation they permit:\n- Number of non-synonymous sites where a substitution constitutes a W-to-S change: $N_{a, W \\to S} = 350$.\n- Number of non-synonymous sites where a substitution constitutes an S-to-W change: $N_{a, S \\to W} = 50$.\n- Number of non-synonymous sites where a substitution constitutes a W/S-neutral change: $N_{a, neut} = 300$.\n\nSimilarly, the synonymous sites are categorized:\n- Number of synonymous sites where a substitution constitutes a W-to-S change: $N_{s, W \\to S} = 50$.\n- Number of synonymous sites where a substitution constitutes an S-to-W change: $N_{s, S \\to W} = 50$.\n- Number of synonymous sites where a substitution constitutes a W/S-neutral change: $N_{s, neut} = 100$.\n\nThe team estimates the gBGC bias factor to be $B=5.0$.\n\nAssuming this model is correct and all mutations are functionally neutral, calculate the expected ratio of the non-synonymous substitution rate per non-synonymous site ($K_a$) to the synonymous substitution rate per synonymous site ($K_s$).

It is scientifically sound, fully specified, and logically consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivations and Calculation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the estimator for $\\alpha$**\n\nThe neutral theory of molecular evolution posits that the vast majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random genetic drift of selectively neutral mutants. A key prediction is that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions should be constant over time if all mutations are neutral. This implies that the ratio of nonsynonymous ($N$) to synonymous ($S$) changes observed within a species (polymorphism, $P$) should be the same as the ratio observed between species (divergence, $D$), after accounting for the number of available sites for each type of mutation.\n\nThe neutral expectation is formally stated as:\n$$ \\frac{D_{N, \\text{neutral}}}{D_S} = \\frac{P_N}{P_S} $$\nHere, $D_{N, \\text{neutral}}$ represents the number of nonsynonymous fixed differences that would be expected if all nonsynonymous mutations were neutral. $D_S$ is the number of synonymous fixed differences, which are generally assumed to be neutral and serve as a baseline. $P_N$ and $P_S$ are the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms, respectively, which reflect the current mutational input and are assumed to be largely neutral or weakly deleterious.\n\nThe total observed number of nonsynonymous fixed differences, $D_N$, is a sum of those that fixed neutrally ($D_{N, \\text{neutral}}$) and those that fixed due to positive selection, i.e., adaptively ($D_{N, \\text{adaptive}}$):\n$$ D_N = D_{N, \\text{neutral}} + D_{N, \\text{adaptive}} $$\n\nFrom the neutral expectation, we can solve for the expected number of neutral nonsynonymous fixed differences:\n$$ D_{N, \\text{neutral}} = D_S \\frac{P_N}{P_S} $$\n\nThe problem defines $\\alpha$ as the fraction of nonsynonymous fixed differences that are adaptive. Mathematically, this is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{D_{N, \\text{adaptive}}}{D_N} $$\n\nSubstituting $D_{N, \\text{adaptive}} = D_N - D_{N, \\text{neutral}}$ into the expression for $\\alpha$ gives:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{D_N - D_{N, \\text{neutral}}}{D_N} = 1 - \\frac{D_{N, \\text{neutral}}}{D_N} $$\n\nFinally, substituting the expression for $D_{N, \\text{neutral}}$ based on the neutral expectation, we arrive at the estimator for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{D_S P_N}{D_N P_S} $$\nThis is the required estimator derived from first principles.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the point estimate of $\\alpha$**\n\nFirst, we must compute the pooled counts from the per-gene data for the $8$ genes.\n$$ P_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} P_{N,i} = 5 + 3 + 7 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 3 = 38 $$\n$$ P_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} P_{S,i} = 22 + 24 + 21 + 26 + 28 + 23 + 20 + 26 = 190 $$\n$$ D_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} D_{N,i} = 12 + 15 + 18 + 20 + 25 + 14 + 23 + 18 = 145 $$\n$$ D_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} D_{S,i} = 20 + 22 + 29 + 34 + 36 + 29 + 30 + 20 = 220 $$\n\nNow, substitute these pooled counts into the estimator for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{(220)(38)}{(145)(190)} = 1 - \\frac{8360}{27550} $$\nCalculating the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{8360}{27550} \\approx 0.303448275... $$\nTherefore, the point estimate of $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} \\approx 1 - 0.303448275... = 0.696551724... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} \\approx 0.6966 $$\n\n**Part 3: Nonparametric bootstrap strategy and standard error expression**\n\nTo assess the uncertainty of the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$, a nonparametric bootstrap procedure by resampling genes is appropriate. The unit of resampling is the entire gene, as the counts ($P_N, P_S, D_N, D_S$) for a single gene are not independent.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n$1$. The original dataset consists of $N=8$ observations, where each observation $i$ is a vector of four counts: $\\text{gene}_i = (P_{N,i}, P_{S,i}, D_{N,i}, D_{S,i})$.\n\n$2$. Generate a bootstrap replicate dataset by sampling $N=8$ genes with replacement from the original set of genes. Let the $b$-th bootstrap sample be $\\{\\text{gene}_1^{(b)}, \\text{gene}_2^{(b)}, ..., \\text{gene}_8^{(b)}\\}$.\n\n$3$. For each bootstrap replicate $b$, calculate the pooled counts by summing over the resampled genes:\n$$ P_N^{(b)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} P_{N,j}^{(b)}, \\quad P_S^{(b)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} P_{S,j}^{(b)}, \\quad D_N^{(b)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} D_{N,j}^{(b)}, \\quad D_S^{(b)} = \\sum_{j=1}^{8} D_{S,j}^{(b)} $$\n\n$4$. Compute the bootstrap replicate estimate of $\\alpha$ for this replicate:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha}^{(b)} = 1 - \\frac{D_S^{(b)} P_N^{(b)}}{D_N^{(b)} P_S^{(b)}} $$\n\n$5$. Repeat steps $2$-$4$ a large number of times, $B$ (e.g., $B \\ge 1000$), to obtain a distribution of bootstrap estimates $\\{\\hat{\\alpha}^{(1)}, \\hat{\\alpha}^{(2)}, ..., \\hat{\\alpha}^{(B)}\\}$.\n\nThe bootstrap standard error, $SE_{\\text{boot}}(\\hat{\\alpha})$, is the standard deviation of this distribution of bootstrap estimates. A closed-form expression for this standard error, in terms of the bootstrap replicate estimates, is given by the sample standard deviation formula:\n$$ SE_{\\text{boot}}(\\hat{\\alpha}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{B-1} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} (\\hat{\\alpha}^{(b)} - \\bar{\\alpha}_{\\text{boot}})^2} $$\nwhere $\\bar{\\alpha}_{\\text{boot}}$ is the mean of the bootstrap replicate estimates:\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha}_{\\text{boot}} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\hat{\\alpha}^{(b)} $$\nThis expression provides the requested measure of statistical uncertainty for the point estimate $\\hat{\\alpha}$.",
