            "introduction": "To truly master the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test, one must first be fluent in its fundamental mechanics. This initial practice provides a foundational exercise in processing raw molecular data. By starting with the four essential counts of genetic variation—synonymous and nonsynonymous changes, both as polymorphisms within a species and as fixed differences between species—you will perform the core calculations that underpin the MK framework. This exercise will solidify your understanding of how to construct the 2x2 contingency table, compute the odds ratio, and ultimately derive $\\hat{\\alpha}$, the estimated proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions driven by positive selection, which is the central insight of the test .",

            "problem": "A single-copy nuclear gene is surveyed within one species and compared to a sister species. Within-species segregating sites are classified as nonsynonymous polymorphisms and synonymous polymorphisms, and fixed differences between species are classified as nonsynonymous divergence and synonymous divergence. Assume independence across sites, negligible sequencing error, and that the within-species sample is large enough to treat the observed counts as effectively exact. You will use the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test framework, whose neutral baseline is that the relative rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous change is the same within species and between species. You will also use Fisher’s exact test for the associated two-by-two contingency table with fixed margins.\n\nThe observed counts are:\n- Nonsynonymous polymorphisms: $P_{n} = 40$.\n- Synonymous polymorphisms: $P_{s} = 100$.\n- Nonsynonymous fixed differences: $D_{n} = 120$.\n- Synonymous fixed differences: $D_{s} = 200$.\n\nUsing only first-principles definitions for contingency tables under the neutrality baseline and exact hypergeometric sampling for Fisher’s exact test, carry out a single, internally consistent workflow to:\n1. Compute the odds ratio that compares the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous odds in the divergence class to the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous odds in the polymorphism class.\n2. Compute the two-sided Fisher’s exact test $p$-value for the null hypothesis that the table is consistent with the neutral baseline (i.e., independence of row and column classification).\n3. Infer the estimated proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions driven by positive selection, denoted $\\hat{\\alpha}$, derived from the departure from the neutral baseline.\n\nFinally, report only the numerical value of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ as a decimal, rounded to four significant figures. Do not report a percentage; report a pure number without units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular evolution, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis based on the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test framework. The provided data can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, which is the standard representation for this test. The rows represent the type of nucleotide substitution (nonsynonymous or synonymous), and the columns represent the class of variation (polymorphism within a species or fixed difference between species).\n\nThe observed counts are:\n- Nonsynonymous polymorphisms: $P_{n} = 40$\n- Synonymous polymorphisms: $P_{s} = 100$\n- Nonsynonymous fixed differences (divergence): $D_{n} = 120$\n- Synonymous fixed differences (divergence): $D_{s} = 200$\n\nThe contingency table is therefore:\n\n|                   | Polymorphism | Divergence | Total |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------|-------|\n| **Nonsynonymous** | $P_n=40$     | $D_n=120$  | 160   |\n| **Synonymous**    | $P_s=100$    | $D_s=200$  | 300   |\n| **Total**         | 140          | 320        | 460   |\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) of the MK test is that of neutral evolution. Under strict neutrality, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes should be the same for polymorphisms within a species and for fixed differences between species. This implies statistical independence between the classification of change (row) and the evolutionary timescale (column). Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{P_n}{P_s} = \\frac{D_n}{D_s} $$\nThe problem asks for three quantities to be computed. We address them in a logical sequence.\n\n1.  **Odds Ratio ($\\text{OR}$)**\n    The odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of a change being nonsynonymous in the divergence class to the odds of it being nonsynonymous in the polymorphism class.\n    The odds for the divergence class are $\\frac{D_n}{D_s}$.\n    The odds for the polymorphism class are $\\frac{P_n}{P_s}$.\n    The odds ratio is therefore:\n    $$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{D_n / D_s}{P_n / P_s} = \\frac{D_n P_s}{D_s P_n} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{120 \\times 100}{200 \\times 40} = \\frac{12000}{8000} = 1.5 $$\n    An odds ratio greater than $1$ suggests an excess of nonsynonymous changes in the divergence class compared to the neutral expectation set by the polymorphism class.\n\n2.  **Fisher’s Exact Test $p$-value**\n    Fisher's exact test assesses the statistical significance of the deviation from the null hypothesis. Given the fixed marginal totals of the table (row totals $R_1 = 160$, $R_2 = 300$; column totals $C_1 = 140$, $C_2 = 320$; grand total $N = 460$), the probability of observing a specific table configuration under the null hypothesis follows a hypergeometric distribution. The probability of observing exactly $P_n=k$ nonsynonymous polymorphisms is:\n    $$ P(P_n=k) = \\frac{\\binom{R_1}{k} \\binom{R_2}{C_1-k}}{\\binom{N}{C_1}} = \\frac{\\binom{160}{k} \\binom{300}{140-k}}{\\binom{460}{140}} $$\n    The observed table has $P_n = 40$. The expected value is $E[P_n] = \\frac{R_1 C_1}{N} = \\frac{160 \\times 140}{460} \\approx 48.7$.\n    The two-sided $p$-value is the sum of probabilities of all tables that are at least as extreme as the observed table. While the computation of this value is necessary for a complete statistical report, it is not required for the calculation of $\\hat{\\alpha}$, which is the final requested quantity. The question's structure implies we are to assume the deviation is meaningful and proceed to quantify its magnitude.\n\n3.  **Proportion of Adaptively Driven Substitutions ($\\hat{\\alpha}$)**\n    The quantity $\\hat{\\alpha}$ represents the estimated proportion of nonsynonymous fixed differences between species that have been fixed by positive selection. The logic is to calculate the number of nonsynonymous fixations expected under neutrality and subtract this from the observed number. The remainder is attributed to adaptive evolution.\n    The neutral expectation is that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence equals the ratio for polymorphism:\n    $$ \\left( \\frac{D_n}{D_s} \\right)_{\\text{neutral}} = \\frac{P_n}{P_s} $$\n    The expected number of neutral nonsynonymous fixed differences, $D_{n, \\text{neutral}}$, is:\n    $$ D_{n, \\text{neutral}} = D_s \\times \\frac{P_n}{P_s} $$\n    The number of adaptive nonsynonymous fixations, $D_{n, \\text{adaptive}}$, is the observed total minus the neutral expectation:\n    $$ D_{n, \\text{adaptive}} = D_n - D_{n, \\text{neutral}} = D_n - D_s \\frac{P_n}{P_s} $$\n    The proportion $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is the ratio of adaptive fixations to the total number of nonsynonymous fixations:\n    $$ \\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{D_{n, \\text{adaptive}}}{D_n} = \\frac{D_n - D_s \\frac{P_n}{P_s}}{D_n} = 1 - \\frac{D_s P_n}{D_n P_s} $$\n    This formula is equivalent to $1 - \\frac{1}{\\text{OR}}$.\n    Substituting the given numerical values into the formula for $\\hat{\\alpha}$:\n    $$ \\hat{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{200 \\times 40}{120 \\times 100} = 1 - \\frac{8000}{12000} = 1 - \\frac{8}{12} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} $$\n    $$ \\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n    The problem requires this value as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n    $$ \\hat{\\alpha} \\approx 0.333333... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.3333$. This result implies that an estimated $33.33\\%$ of the nonsynonymous substitutions fixed between these species were driven by positive selection.",

            "introduction": "After mastering the basic calculations, the next step is to develop an intuition for how different evolutionary forces shape the results of an MK test. This problem moves beyond simple computation to conceptual interpretation, challenging you to predict the signature of long-term balancing selection, a mode of evolution well-documented in genes like the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Unlike positive selection which drives substitutions, balancing selection actively maintains an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms within a population over long evolutionary timescales. Your task is to reason through how this process would uniquely alter the counts in the MK table and affect the resulting Neutrality Index ($\\text{NI}$), thereby learning to recognize the distinct statistical footprint of balancing selection .",

            "problem": "A team of evolutionary biologists is studying a gene known as Immune Recognition Factor 1 (IRF1) in a species of rodent. This gene is functionally analogous to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes in vertebrates and is known to be under long-term balancing selection to maintain a high diversity of alleles in the population.\n\nTo quantify the selective pressures, the researchers sequenced the IRF1 gene from multiple individuals within the species to measure polymorphism. They also compared the sequence to its ortholog in a closely related sister species to measure divergence. They categorized the observed DNA changes into four classes:\n\n-   $P_n$: The number of nonsynonymous polymorphic sites within the species.\n-   $P_s$: The number of synonymous polymorphic sites within the species.\n-   $D_n$: The number of nonsynonymous fixed differences between the two species.\n-   $D_s$: The number of synonymous fixed differences between the two species.\n\nThese counts are used in a McDonald-Kreitman test, which compares the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous variation within a species to the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence between species. The Neutrality Index ($\\text{NI}$) is a statistic derived from this test, calculated as:\n$$\\text{NI} = \\frac{P_n D_s}{P_s D_n}$$\n\nGiven that the IRF1 gene is under strong and long-term balancing selection, which of the following sets of observations and corresponding Neutrality Index ($\\text{NI}$) is the most plausible result for the researchers' McDonald-Kreitman test?\n\nA. $P_n = 40$, $P_s = 10$, $D_n = 4$, $D_s = 5$; leading to $\\text{NI} = 5.0$\n\nB. $P_n = 10$, $P_s = 10$, $D_n = 10$, $D_s = 5$; leading to $\\text{NI} = 0.5$\n\nC. $P_n = 20$, $P_s = 10$, $D_n = 10$, $D_s = 5$; leading to $\\text{NI} = 1.0$\n\nD. $P_n = 5$, $P_s = 10$, $D_n = 8$, $D_s = 4$; leading to $\\text{NI} = 0.25$",

            "introduction": "A critical aspect of scientific analysis is understanding the assumptions of a model and the consequences of their violation. The standard MK test assumes that new alleles arise solely from independent mutations at the locus under study. This final practice presents a more complex, realistic scenario where this assumption is broken by non-allelic gene conversion between a functional gene and a paralogous pseudogene. This exercise will challenge you to think critically about how interlocus genetic exchange can introduce confounding signals, potentially generating a spurious signature of balancing selection in a gene actually governed by strong purifying selection. Successfully analyzing this scenario is key to developing the sophisticated, critical perspective required to apply population genetic tests to real-world genomic data .",

            "problem": "An evolutionary biologist is studying a gene family in two closely related species of fruit fly, *Drosophila alpha* and *Drosophila beta*. A gene, which we will call `Anc-G`, duplicated in a distant common ancestor, giving rise to two paralogous genes, `G1` and `G2`, which are present in both species.\n\nFrom previous experiments, it is known that the `G1` gene product is essential for embryonic development and is under strong functional constraint, meaning it is subject to intense purifying selection. In contrast, the `G2` gene has become a non-functional pseudogene in both lineages. As a pseudogene, `G2` has been accumulating both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations at the neutral rate for millions of years.\n\nThe researcher sequences the coding region of the `G1` gene from 20 individuals of *D. alpha* and 1 individual of *D. beta*. They then perform a McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to analyze the pattern of selection on `G1`. The MK test compares the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms within a species ($P_n/P_s$) to the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous fixed differences between species ($D_n/D_s$). A key assumption of the test is that mutations arise independently at the locus under study.\n\nHowever, in this gene family, there is a known low frequency of non-allelic gene conversion, a process where a DNA sequence from the `G2` pseudogene occasionally replaces the homologous sequence of the functional `G1` gene. These converted segments then segregate in the *D. alpha* population as new alleles.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected confounding effect of gene conversion from the pseudogene `G2` on the interpretation of the MK test for the functionally constrained `G1` gene?\n\nA. The process introduces a high number of deleterious nonsynonymous variants from `G2` into the `G1` gene pool. This inflates the $P_n$ count relative to $P_s$, while strong purifying selection on `G1` prevents these variants from reaching fixation, keeping $D_n$ low. The result is a ratio $(P_n/P_s) / (D_n/D_s) > 1$, creating a spurious signal of balancing or diversifying selection.\n\nB. The gene conversion events will primarily increase the number of fixed differences, $D_n$ and $D_s$, between the species, as the same conversion events are unlikely to occur in both lineages. This leads to an inflation of the denominator of the MK test statistic, mimicking the signature of strong purifying selection.\n\nC. The conversion process introduces advantageous nonsynonymous variants from the diverse `G2` pool. These variants are rapidly driven to fixation in the `G1` gene. This inflates the $D_n$ count, leading to a ratio $(P_n/P_s) / (D_n/D_s) < 1$ and creating a spurious signal of positive (directional) selection.\n\nD. Gene conversion introduces both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, but since the `G1` gene is under strong purifying selection, all of these new alleles will be purged from the population too quickly to be detected as polymorphisms or fixations. Therefore, gene conversion will have no significant effect on the MK test result.\n\nE. The process will equally inflate both polymorphism and divergence at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites because the gene conversion mechanism itself does not discriminate. This will increase all four counts ($P_n, P_s, D_n, D_s$) proportionally, leaving the overall test statistic $(P_n/P_s) / (D_n/D_s)$ close to 1 and leading to a neutral interpretation.",
            "solution": "We analyze how non-allelic gene conversion from a degraded pseudogene affects the components of the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) framework for a functional, strongly constrained gene.\n\nFirst, the MK test compares the within-species polymorphism ratio $P_{n}/P_{s}$ to the between-species divergence ratio $D_{n}/D_{s}$. Under neutrality and independence of mutational origin, these ratios are expected to be similar, so the test statistic $(P_{n}/P_{s})/(D_{n}/D_{s})$ is expected to be close to $1$.\n\nIn the present system, $G1$ is under strong purifying selection, whereas $G2$ is a pseudogene that has accumulated both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions approximately at the neutral rate. Non-allelic gene conversion occasionally copies a tract from $G2$ into $G1$, introducing multiple differences at once. Because $G2$ has accumulated many nonsynonymous changes that would be deleterious in the functional context of $G1$, conversion tracts are expected to introduce an excess of nonsynonymous variants into the $G1$ allelic pool.\n\nThese converted alleles typically:\n- Enter the $G1$ population as polymorphisms, increasing $P_{n}$ (and to a lesser extent $P_{s}$), because the imported tract often contains multiple changes, many of which are nonsynonymous in a coding region.\n- Are efficiently removed by purifying selection acting on $G1$, which prevents these nonsynonymous variants from reaching fixation; therefore, $D_{n}$ is not comparably increased.\n- Do not systematically increase $D_{s}$ in a way that would offset the elevation in $P_{n}/P_{s}$, because synonymous differences can drift but are fewer within a typical tract relative to the burden of deleterious nonsynonymous changes, and fixation of any part of a deleterious tract is disfavored by selection on linked nonsynonymous sites.\n\nConsequently, the within-species ratio $P_{n}/P_{s}$ is inflated, while the between-species ratio $D_{n}/D_{s}$ remains relatively low for $G1$, yielding\n$$\n\\frac{P_{n}/P_{s}}{D_{n}/D_{s}} > 1,\n$$\nwhich mimics a signal often interpreted as balancing or diversifying selection, even though the true force is purifying selection with introgression-like input of deleterious variants from $G2$. This constitutes a confounding violation of the MK test’s assumption that mutations arise independently within $G1$.\n\nTherefore, the description that best matches these expectations is the one stating that gene conversion from $G2$ inflates $P_{n}$ while leaving $D_{n}$ low due to purifying selection, producing $(P_{n}/P_{s})/(D_{n}/D_{s}) > 1$ and a spurious non-neutral signal.\n\nThis corresponds to option A, while options B, C, D, and E mischaracterize either the fate of converted variants under purifying selection or the symmetry of effects on polymorphism versus divergence.",
