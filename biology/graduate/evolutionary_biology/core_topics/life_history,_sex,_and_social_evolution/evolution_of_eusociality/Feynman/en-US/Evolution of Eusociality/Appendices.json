            "introduction": "The evolution of sterile worker castes, a hallmark of eusociality, presents a classic Darwinian puzzle: how can a trait that eliminates direct reproduction spread? The theory of kin selection, formalized by W.D. Hamilton's rule, $rB - C > 0$, provides the crucial answer by accounting for indirect fitness benefits. This foundational exercise () provides a direct, quantitative application of the rule, challenging you to calculate the net inclusive fitness outcome of altruistic sterility to determine whether natural selection would favor such a trait in a classic haplodiploid system.",

            "problem": "A monogynous, monandrous haplodiploid colony (one queen, one mating) produces full sisters whose Wright’s coefficient of relatedness is $r=0.75$. Consider a rare, additive, weakly selected allele that is expressed only in heterozygous female carriers and causes them to adopt a sterile helper phenotype. Assume that the allele’s expression causes the actor to permanently forgo $C=1.2$ units of expected lifetime personal reproduction (measured in female reproductive equivalents) while increasing a single full sister’s expected lifetime reproduction by $B=2.0$ units via helping. There are no additional demographic or ecological feedbacks; all effects are marginal and additive; and population structure is otherwise constant so that relatedness $r$ captures the probability of identity by descent (IBD) between actor and recipient above the population mean.\n\nUsing inclusive-fitness accounting, compute the net marginal change in the expected number of IBD gene copies contributed to the next generation by an allele carrier who switches from independent reproduction to sterility and helping, given the values $r=0.75$, $B=2.0$, and $C=1.2$. Report this net change as a single real number, rounded to four significant figures. In your reasoning, indicate whether this sign implies that selection favors or disfavors the sterility allele and explain the biological meaning of that sign in the context of the evolution of eusociality. The final reported value must be unitless and contain no explanatory text.",
            "solution": "The appropriate foundational base is Hamilton’s inclusive fitness framework, which decomposes the effect of an actor’s phenotype on the expected transmission of gene copies into a direct component through the actor’s own reproduction and an indirect component through effects on the reproduction of social partners weighted by their coefficient of relatedness. Formally, under weak selection and additivity, the change in gene frequency is proportional to the change in inclusive fitness, which is the sum of the actor’s direct fitness effect plus the relatedness-weighted sum of effects on recipients.\n\nDefine $r$ as Wright’s coefficient of relatedness between actor and recipient, $B$ as the marginal increase in the recipient’s expected reproduction caused by the actor’s behavior, and $C$ as the marginal decrease in the actor’s own expected reproduction due to expressing the behavior. The inclusive-fitness change experienced by a rare allele when its carrier switches from independent reproduction to helping a single recipient is the indirect benefit to identical-by-descent (IBD) copies in the recipient minus the direct loss to the actor. Thus, the net marginal change in expected IBD gene copies contributed to the next generation is\n$$\n\\Delta W_{I} \\;=\\; r\\,B \\;-\\; C.\n$$\nThis expression follows from summing the direct component (a loss of $C$) and the indirect component (a gain of $rB$), where $r$ scales the recipient’s benefit into IBD gene copies attributable to the focal allele.\n\nSubstitute the given values $r=0.75$, $B=2.0$, and $C=1.2$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{I} \\;=\\; (0.75)\\times(2.0)\\;-\\;1.2 \\;=\\; 1.5 \\;-\\; 1.2 \\;=\\; 0.3.\n$$\n\nBecause $\\Delta W_{I} = 0.3 > 0$, the sign is positive. Under weak selection, a positive $\\Delta W_{I}$ implies that selection favors the sterility-and-helping phenotype: the expected number of identical-by-descent gene copies transmitted indirectly through a full sister (weighted by $r=0.75$) more than compensates for the actor’s forfeited direct reproduction. Biologically, this means that in a haplodiploid system with high sister–sister relatedness, helping behavior that boosts a sister’s reproduction by $B=2.0$ at a personal cost of $C=1.2$ can be favored, illuminating one route by which eusociality (with worker sterility) can evolve.\n\nFinally, round the numerical value to four significant figures:\n$$\n0.3 \\;\\to\\; 0.3000.\n$$",

This parameter is not an arbitrary constant but a direct consequence of a species' genetic and reproductive system. In this practice (), you will move beyond using pre-supplied values to derive key relatedness coefficients from the first principles of haplodiploid inheritance. This task will illuminate the famous relatedness asymmetries in Hymenoptera and reveal how they can fuel kin-selected conflict between the queen and her workers over male production.",

            "problem": "In a eusocial Hymenoptera colony with haplodiploid sex determination, males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs, while females are diploid and develop from fertilized eggs. Consider a focal worker contemplating whether to lay an unfertilized egg that, if successful, yields a surviving male.

            "solution": "An action is favored by kin selection if it increases the actor's inclusive fitness. The change in inclusive fitness, $\\Delta W_{I}$, is calculated by summing the fitness effects of an action on the actor and its relatives, with each effect weighted by the actor's coefficient of relatedness to the individual affected. In this problem, the actor is a focal worker, and the action is to produce one of her own sons. This action has a direct consequence: it displaces $k$ of the queen's sons (the worker's brothers) from being raised.\n\nThe inclusive fitness calculation can be expressed as a comparison between the genetic value to the worker of producing her son versus the genetic value of the $k$ brothers she foregoes. The \"genetic value\" of a relative is proportional to the worker's coefficient of relatedness to that relative. The action is favored if the inclusive fitness gain from producing a son is greater than the inclusive fitness loss from the displaced brothers.\n\nLet $r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}}$ be the coefficient of relatedness between the worker and her own son.\nLet $r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}$ be the coefficient of relatedness between the worker and her brother.\n\nThe inclusive fitness benefit is from the production of one son, which is a gain of $1 \\times r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}}$.\nThe inclusive fitness cost is from the displacement of $k$ brothers, which is a loss of $k \\times r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}$.\n\nThe action is selectively favored if the benefit exceeds the cost:\n$$1 \\cdot r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}} > k \\cdot r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to find the condition on $k$:\n$$k  \\frac{r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}}}{r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}}$$\nThe threshold value, $k^{\\ast}$, is therefore the ratio of these two coefficients of relatedness:\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\frac{r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}}}{r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}}$$\n\nNow, we must compute these two coefficients of relatedness based on the principles of haplodiploid inheritance. The coefficient of relatedness is defined as the probability that a randomly sampled allele at a particular locus in one individual is identical by descent (IBD) to a randomly sampled allele at the same locus in another individual. We assume the parents (queen and her mate) are not inbred and are unrelated.\n\n1.  **Relatedness of a worker to her son ($r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}}$):**\n    A worker is a female and is therefore diploid, possessing two sets of homologous chromosomes. Her son develops from one of her unfertilized eggs, so he is male and haploid, possessing only one set of chromosomes. The son's entire genome is a random meiotic product from his mother, the worker. To calculate the relatedness, we sample a random allele from the son and a random allele from the worker at the same locus.\n    *   The son is haploid, so sampling a random allele from him is certain to pick the single allele he possesses at that locus. This allele came from his mother.\n    *   The worker is diploid. When we sample a random allele from her, there is a $1/2$ probability that we pick the very same allele that she passed on to her son, and a $1/2$ probability that we pick the other homologous allele.\n    *   Thus, the probability that the two sampled alleles are IBD is exactly $1/2$.\n    $$r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n2.  **Relatedness of a worker to her brother ($r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}$):**\n    A worker is female (diploid) and her brother is male (haploid). They share the same mother (the queen). The worker receives half of her genes from the queen and half from her father. The brother, developing from an unfertilized egg from the queen, receives all of his genes from the queen.\n    *   Let us sample a random allele from the worker. The probability that this allele came from her mother (the queen) is $1/2$. The probability it came from her father is $1/2$.\n    *   Let us sample a random allele from the brother. As he is haploid, this is his only allele at the locus, and it came from the queen with probability $1$.\n    *   For the two alleles to be IBD, the allele sampled from the worker must have also come from the queen. If it came from the father, it cannot be IBD with an allele from the brother (since the queen and her mate are unrelated). This occurs with probability $1/2$.\n    *   Given that the worker's allele does come from the queen, we are now comparing two alleles randomly drawn from the queen's diploid genome. The probability that two such alleles are IBD is $1/2$.\n    *   The total probability of IBD is the product of these probabilities: the probability that the worker's allele came from the queen, multiplied by the probability that it is the same copy as the brother's allele.\n    $$r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}} = P(\\text{allele from Queen in worker}) \\times P(\\text{alleles IBD} | \\text{both from Queen}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nWith the coefficients of relatedness computed, we can now find the threshold $k^{\\ast}$:\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\frac{r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{son}}}{r_{\\text{worker} \\to \\text{brother}}} = \\frac{1/2}{1/4}$$\n$$k^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{1} = 2$$\n\nThus, a worker's production of a son is selectively favored if it displaces fewer than $2$ of the queen's sons. The threshold value beyond which the action is not favored is $k^{\\ast} = 2$.",

            "introduction": "Building on the principles of relatedness and conflict, this final practice explores a more complex and realistic social dynamic: worker policing. A worker's decision to prevent her sisters from reproducing is not fixed; it depends on the colony's social structure, particularly the queen's mating frequency.

            "problem": "Consider a haplodiploid eusocial insect with a single queen who mates with $m$ distinct, unrelated males. Assume that paternity among workers is equally partitioned among the $m$ males, there is no inbreeding, and that any worker who lays an egg is equally likely to come from any patriline. Males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. Define genetic relatedness $r$ between an actor and a recipient as the probability that a randomly chosen gene copy in the recipient is identical by descent to a randomly chosen gene copy in the actor, relative to the population baseline.\n\nWorkers may police worker-laid eggs. Ignoring any direct costs or colony-level efficiency effects, suppose selection on worker policing is determined solely by whether a focal worker is, on average, more related to the queen’s sons (her brothers) than to worker-produced sons of other workers (her nephews). Using only the inheritance rules above and the definition of relatedness, and without invoking any pre-derived kinship shortcuts, perform the following:\n\n1. Derive the relatedness of a focal worker to a randomly chosen brother (a queen-produced male).\n2. Derive the relatedness of a focal worker to a randomly chosen nephew (a worker-produced male), averaging over whether the nephew’s mother is a full sister or a half sister of the focal worker, given $m$ and the assumptions stated.\n3. By comparing these two relatednesses, obtain the threshold queen mating number $m^{*}$ above which a focal worker is, on average, more related to a brother than to a nephew, making policing favored by this relatedness criterion.\n\nExpress your final answer for $m^{*}$ as a single exact integer with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires deriving a threshold for the queen's number of mates, $m$, above which worker policing is favored. This occurs when a worker is more related to her brothers than to her nephews, on average. The analysis must be done from first principles for a haplodiploid system.\n\nLet W be the focal worker (actor), B be her brother (queen's son), and N be her nephew (another worker's son).\n\nFirst, we derive the relatedness of a worker to her brother, $r_{W \\rightarrow B}$.\nThe brother (B) is haploid and gets his entire genome from the queen (Q). The worker (W) is diploid and gets half her genes from the queen and half from her father. A random gene from the worker comes from the queen with probability $1/2$. For this gene to be identical by descent (IBD) with a gene from her brother, it must be the same copy that the queen passed to her son. The probability of two random genes from a diploid individual being IBD is $1/2$. So, the total probability is the product of these paths:\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow B} = P(\\text{gene from Q in W}) \\times P(\\text{genes IBD | both from Q}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the average relatedness of a worker to her nephew, $r_{W \\rightarrow N}$.\nThe nephew (N) is the haploid son of another worker (W'). A son inherits a random half of his mother's diploid genes. Therefore, the relatedness of the focal worker W to her nephew N is half her relatedness to the nephew's mother, W':\n$$r_{W \\to N} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{W \\to W'}$$\nThe mother of the nephew, W', is a random worker from the colony, so she is a sister to the focal worker W. With $m$ mates, W' is a full sister with probability $1/m$ and a half sister with probability $(m-1)/m$. The average relatedness $r_{W \\to W'}$ is a weighted average:\n$$r_{W \\to W'} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) r_{\\text{full-sis}} + \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right) r_{\\text{half-sis}}$$\nWe must compute the relatedness for full sisters and half sisters from first principles.\n- **Full sisters ($r_{\\text{full-sis}}$):** They share a diploid mother and a haploid father. Their relatedness is the sum of their relatedness through each parent. Through their diploid mother, it is $1/4$. Through their haploid father, who gives identical genes to all daughters, the paternal half of their genome is identical, contributing $1/2$ to their total relatedness. Thus, $r_{\\text{full-sis}} = 1/4 \\text{ (maternal)} + 1/2 \\text{ (paternal)} = 3/4$.\n- **Half sisters ($r_{\\text{half-sis}}$):** They share only their diploid mother. Their relatedness is therefore just the maternal component, so $r_{\\text{half-sis}} = 1/4$.\nNow we can calculate the average relatedness to a random sister, W':\n$$r_{W \\to W'} = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{m-1}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3 + m - 1}{4m} = \\frac{m+2}{4m}$$\nFinally, the average relatedness of the focal worker to her nephew is:\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow N} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{W \\to W'} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{m+2}{4m}\\right) = \\frac{m+2}{8m}$$\n\nThird, we find the threshold queen mating number $m^{*}$ above which policing is favored. This occurs when the relatedness to a brother is greater than the average relatedness to a nephew.\n$$r_{W \\rightarrow B} > r_{W \\rightarrow N}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\\frac{1}{4} > \\frac{m+2}{8m}$$\nSince $m$ is the number of mates, $m \\ge 1$; thus $8m$ is a positive value. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $8m$ without changing its direction:\n$$2m > m+2$$\nSubtracting $m$ from both sides gives the condition:\n$$m > 2$$\nThis inequality indicates that worker policing is favored by the relatedness criterion when the queen mates with more than $2$ males. The threshold value $m^{*}$ is therefore $2$.",
