            "introduction": "The most fundamental critique of sexual reproduction is its apparent demographic inefficiency, often termed the \"cost of males.\" In many species, males contribute genetic material but do not bear offspring, meaning a sexual population allocates roughly half of its reproductive resources to producing non-reproducing individuals. This foundational exercise prompts you to quantify this cost from first principles, deriving the per-generation growth factors for hypothetical sexual and asexual populations to reveal the precise mathematical basis for this disadvantage . Engaging with this derivation solidifies the understanding of why asexuality, on demographic grounds alone, appears to hold a powerful advantage.",

            "problem": "Consider two large, density-independent populations with discrete, non-overlapping generations and no adult survival past reproduction. In both populations, each reproductive female produces an expected $F$ viable offspring per generation, where $F>0$ is constant.

Assume there is no differential mortality between the sexes before reproduction and that mating does not limit female realization of fecundity as long as males are present.\n\nPopulation $s$ is obligately sexual: only females reproduce. Population $a$ is obligately asexual (clonal): every individual reproduces and produces only female offspring genetically identical to the parent. For both populations, define the per-generation growth factor $\\lambda$ as the multiplicative factor by which the number of reproductive individuals changes from generation $t$ to $t+1$.\n\nUsing only fundamental demographic definitions of fecundity and class contribution to the next generation, and without invoking any pre-derived results specific to the costs of sex, derive closed-form expressions for:\n- $\\lambda_s$, the per-generation growth factor in the number of reproductive individuals for the sexual population,\n- $\\lambda_a$, the per-generation growth factor in the number of reproductive individuals for the asexual population,\n- the cost ratio $\\lambda_a/\\lambda_s$ as a function of $\\alpha$ and $F$.\n\nProvide exact expressions.

            "introduction": "Beyond the demographic cost of producing males, sexual reproduction carries intrinsic genetic costs due to the mechanics of meiosis and segregation. One such cost arises when the heterozygous genotype at a locus has superior fitness compared to either homozygous genotype, a scenario known as overdominance. This exercise asks you to quantify the \"segregation load,\" the reduction in mean population fitness that occurs because sexual reproduction inevitably breaks up advantageous heterozygous genotypes to produce less-fit homozygous offspring . This practice demonstrates that even at a single gene, the process of segregation can impose a significant fitness cost, highlighting a key challenge that the benefits of sex must overcome.",

            "problem": "In a large, randomly mating diploid population with discrete generations, consider a single locus with two alleles, $A$ and $a$, with allele frequency $p$ for $A$ and $1-p$ for $a$ among zygotes prior to selection.

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The derivation proceeds from first principles of population genetics.\nFirst, we establish the genotype frequencies among zygotes. According to the premise of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, for a locus with two alleles $A$ and $a$ with frequencies $p$ and $1-p$ respectively, the frequencies of the genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are given by:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $f(AA) = p^{2}$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $f(Aa) = 2p(1-p)$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $f(aa) = (1-p)^{2}$\n\nNext, we calculate the mean viability, $\\bar{w}$, of the population. This is the weighted average of the individual genotype viabilities, where the weights are the genotype frequencies at the zygote stage.\n$$ \\bar{w} = f(AA)w_{AA} + f(Aa)w_{Aa} + f(aa)w_{aa} $$\nSubstituting the genotype frequencies and their respective viabilities ($w_{AA}=1-s$, $w_{Aa}=1$, $w_{aa}=1-s$):\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^{2}(1-s) + 2p(1-p)(1) + (1-p)^{2}(1-s) $$\nThis expression can be rearranged by factoring out the term $(1-s)$:\n$$ \\bar{w} = (p^{2} + (1-p)^{2})(1-s) + 2p(1-p) $$\nRecall the identity derived from the binomial expansion of $(p + (1-p))^{2} = 1$:\n$$ p^{2} + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^{2} = 1 $$\nFrom this, we can write the sum of homozygote frequencies as:\n$$ p^{2} + (1-p)^{2} = 1 - 2p(1-p) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ \\bar{w} = (1 - 2p(1-p))(1-s) + 2p(1-p) $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 - s - 2p(1-p) + 2sp(1-p) + 2p(1-p) $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 - s + 2sp(1-p) $$\nAn alternative, more direct simplification for the subsequent calculation is to express $\\bar{w}$ as:\n$$ \\bar{w} = p^{2} + (1-p)^{2} - s(p^{2} + (1-p)^{2}) + 2p(1-p) $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = (p^{2} + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^{2}) - s(p^{2} + (1-p)^{2}) $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 - s(p^{2} + (1-p)^{2}) $$\nThis form is correct and convenient.\n\nNow, we determine the maximum genotype viability, $w_{\\max}$. The given viabilities are $w_{AA}=1-s$, $w_{Aa}=1$, and $w_{aa}=1-s$. Since the problem specifies $0 < s < 1$, it follows that $1-s < 1$. Thus, the maximum viability among the three genotypes is that of the heterozygote:\n$$ w_{\\max} = w_{Aa} = 1 $$\n\nFinally, we apply the definition of segregation load, $L_{\\mathrm{seg}}$:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{seg}} = \\frac{w_{\\max} - \\bar{w}}{w_{\\max}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $w_{\\max}$ and $\\bar{w}$:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{seg}} = \\frac{1 - [1 - s(p^{2} + (1-p)^{2})]}{1} $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 1 - 1 + s(p^{2} + (1-p)^{2}) $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{seg}} = s(p^{2} + (1-p)^{2}) $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the segregation load in terms of $p$ and $s$. The load is directly proportional to the selection coefficient $s$ against the homozygotes and the total frequency of homozygous individuals in the zygote population. The expression can also be written by expanding the polynomial as $L_{\\mathrm{seg}} = s(2p^{2} - 2p + 1)$, but the first form is more compact and illustrative.",

            "introduction": "The genetic costs of sex become even more complex when considering interactions between different genes, a phenomenon known as epistasis.

Recombination reshuffles alleles between loci. A fraction $1-r$ of haplotypes are transmitted without recombination, while a fraction $r$ are broken apart and reformed through new associations of alleles. The frequency of a haplotype after recombination, say $x'_{AB}$, is the sum of non-recombinant $AB$ haplotypes and newly formed recombinant $AB$ haplotypes.
