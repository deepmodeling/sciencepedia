            "introduction": "The cornerstone of parental investment theory is that the sex investing more time and energy per offspring becomes a limited resource for the other sex. This exercise provides a hands-on way to quantify this imbalance using the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR), the ratio of sexually receptive males to females. By working through this hypothetical scenario , you will see how sex-specific time budgets for reproductive activities directly translate into the intensity of sexual selection, a fundamental concept first articulated by Trivers.",

            "problem": "In the study of evolutionary biology, the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) is a critical concept for understanding mating systems and sexual selection. It is defined as the ratio of sexually receptive males to sexually receptive females in a population at any given time.\n\nConsider a hypothetical bird species, the Azure Skydancer, which has a stable population with an equal number of adult males and females. During the breeding season, the mating behaviors of the two sexes differ significantly due to their distinct parental investment strategies.\n\n- A male Azure Skydancer spends 1 day successfully finding a mate and copulating. After this, he enters a mandatory 2-day refractory and recovery period before he can begin searching for a new mate.\n- A female Azure Skydancer, after a 1-day period of receptivity and mating, immediately enters a non-receptive period of 39 days for egg-laying and incubation. She will not be receptive to mating again until this period is over.\n\nAssuming the breeding season is long enough for these cycles to reach a steady state, calculate the Operational Sex Ratio for the Azure Skydancer population. Based on this OSR, predict which sex will experience more intense intra-sexual competition for access to mates. Select the option that correctly identifies both the OSR and the more competitive sex.\n\nA. OSR = 1.0; Competition is equal between the sexes.\n\nB. OSR = 0.075; Females are more competitive.\n\nC. OSR = 13.3; Males are more competitive.\n\nD. OSR = 13.3; Females are more competitive.\n\nE. OSR = 0.075; Males are more competitive.",
            "solution": "Let the adult population have $N_{m}$ males and $N_{f}$ females with $N_{m}=N_{f}$, as stated. In steady state, the proportion of each sex that is sexually receptive at any instant equals the fraction of time that sex spends in the receptive state per cycle.\n\nFor males: each cycle consists of $1$ day receptive (searching and copulating) followed by $2$ days non-receptive (refractory and recovery), giving a cycle length of $1+2=3$ days. Thus the receptive fraction for males is\n$$\nf_{m}=\\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\nFor females: each cycle consists of $1$ day receptive (receptivity and mating) followed by $39$ days non-receptive (egg-laying and incubation), giving a cycle length of $1+39=40$ days. Thus the receptive fraction for females is\n$$\nf_{f}=\\frac{1}{40}.\n$$\nBy definition, the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) is the ratio of sexually receptive males to sexually receptive females at a given time. In steady state,\n$$\n\\mathrm{OSR}=\\frac{\\text{receptive males}}{\\text{receptive females}}=\\frac{N_{m} f_{m}}{N_{f} f_{f}}.\n$$\nWith $N_{m}=N_{f}$, this reduces to\n$$\n\\mathrm{OSR}=\\frac{f_{m}}{f_{f}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{40}}=\\frac{40}{3}.\n$$\nSince $\\frac{40}{3}\\approx 13.3>1$, there are many more receptive males than receptive females at any moment, implying more intense intrasexual competition among males for access to the fewer receptive females. This corresponds to option C.",

            "introduction": "Building on the idea of sex-specific costs, we now focus on an individual's strategic decision. This problem  applies the powerful framework of inclusive fitness theory to derive the conditions under which male parental care is evolutionarily favored. You will derive a precise mathematical threshold by incorporating the cost of care ($c$), the benefit to offspring ($b$), and the male's average genetic relatedness to the brood, which is critically discounted by paternity uncertainty ($p$).",
            "id": "2740990",
            "problem": "A male in a diploid, autosomal species faces a binary decision to provide a fixed unit of parental care to a brood produced by his social mate. Providing this care increases the brood’s expected number of offspring that survive to reproduce by an amount $b$ relative to withholding care. However, caregiving reduces the male’s own future direct reproduction by an expected amount $c$ in surviving offspring equivalents due to lost mating opportunities and increased mortality risk. Assume additivity of fitness effects, weak selection, no inbreeding, and that aside from possible paternity, the male is not otherwise genetically related to the brood. Let $p \\in [0,1]$ denote the male’s paternity confidence, defined as the probability that a randomly chosen cared-for offspring in the brood is his genetic offspring.\n\nUsing the definition of inclusive fitness and regression-based relatedness under diploidy (so that a parent is related to its own offspring by $r_{0}=\\frac{1}{2}$), derive from first principles how paternity uncertainty rescales the expected inclusive fitness return to male care. Then, by comparing the inclusive fitness of providing versus withholding care, derive the threshold paternity confidence $p^{\\*}$ above which male care is favored as a function of the cost-benefit parameters $b$ and $c$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $p^{\\*}$. No units are required. Do not provide an inequality.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a threshold for paternal care based on the principles of inclusive fitness, accounting for paternity uncertainty. The decision for the male is to either provide care or withhold it. We will evaluate the change in the male's inclusive fitness, $\\Delta W_{IF}$, when he chooses to provide care. Natural selection will favor this behavior if $\\Delta W_{IF} > 0$.\n\nInclusive fitness is the sum of an individual's direct fitness (its own reproductive success) and its indirect fitness (the change it causes in the reproductive success of its relatives, weighted by the coefficient of relatedness). The change in inclusive fitness for an actor performing a behavior can be written using Hamilton's rule framework. Let the cost of the behavior to the actor be $c$, and the benefit to a recipient be $b$. The behavior is favored if $rB > C$, where $C$ is the fitness cost to self, $B$ is the fitness benefit to the recipient, and $r$ is the coefficient of relatedness between the actor and the recipient.\n\nIn this problem, the male is the actor. The decision to provide care has two primary consequences:\n$1$. A reduction in the male's own future reproductive success. This is the direct fitness cost, $c$. The actor's relatedness to himself is $1$.\n$2$. An increase in the reproductive success of the brood he cares for. This is the benefit, $b$. The recipients are the offspring in the brood.\n\nTo apply the inclusive fitness logic, we must determine the male's average relatedness to the brood he is caring for. Let $p$ be the paternity confidence, which is the probability that a randomly selected offspring in the brood is the male's genetic offspring. The coefficient of relatedness between a parent and its own offspring in a diploid, autosomal system without inbreeding is given as $r_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The problem states that the male is not otherwise genetically related to the brood. This implies that his relatedness to any offspring in the brood that are not his own is $0$.\n\nWe can therefore calculate the actor's (the male's) average relatedness to the recipient (the brood), denoted as $r_{brood}$, by taking the weighted average of his relatedness to his own offspring and his relatedness to the other offspring:\n$$r_{brood} = p \\times (\\text{relatedness to own offspring}) + (1-p) \\times (\\text{relatedness to non-offspring})$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$r_{brood} = p \\times r_{0} + (1-p) \\times 0 = p \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}$$\n\nNow we can formulate the change in the male's inclusive fitness, $\\Delta W_{IF}$, from providing care. It is the sum of the indirect fitness gain (from the benefit to the brood) and the direct fitness loss (the cost to himself).\n$$\\Delta W_{IF} = (\\text{Benefit to brood}) \\times (\\text{Average relatedness to brood}) - (\\text{Cost to self})$$\n$$\\Delta W_{IF} = b \\times r_{brood} - c$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{brood}$:\n$$\\Delta W_{IF} = b \\times \\frac{p}{2} - c$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks how paternity uncertainty rescales the expected inclusive fitness return. The inclusive fitness return comes from the benefit term, $b$. In the case of certain paternity ($p=1$), the return from care would be $b \\times \\frac{1}{2}$. With paternity uncertainty ($p < 1$), the expected return is rescaled to $b \\times \\frac{p}{2}$. Thus, the paternity confidence $p$ acts as a linear scaling factor that discounts the inclusive fitness benefit accrued through the brood, reflecting the probability that the investment is directed towards the male's own genetic kin.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the threshold paternity confidence, $p^{\\*}$, above which male care is favored. Male care will be favored by selection if the net change in inclusive fitness is positive, i.e., $\\Delta W_{IF} > 0$.\n$$b \\times \\frac{p}{2} - c > 0$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to show the condition on $p$:\n$$\\frac{pb}{2} > c$$\n$$p > \\frac{2c}{b}$$\n\nThe threshold value, $p^{\\*}$, is the point of equality, where the inclusive fitness of providing care is exactly equal to the inclusive fitness of withholding care ($\\Delta W_{IF} = 0$). At this threshold, selection is neutral with respect to the decision. We solve for $p$ at this boundary:\n$$b \\times \\frac{p^{\\*}}{2} - c = 0$$\n$$b \\times \\frac{p^{\\*}}{2} = c$$\n$$p^{\\*} = \\frac{2c}{b}$$\nThis is the threshold paternity confidence. If the male's actual paternity confidence $p$ is greater than this value $p^{\\*}$, then providing care yields a net inclusive fitness gain, and the behavior is evolutionarily favored.",
