This exercise moves beyond rote memorization of common values by challenging you to calculate $r$ from first principles for two distinct relationships: half-siblings and an aunt-niece pair. By tracing the paths of identity by descent, you will develop a deeper intuition for how genealogy translates into the probabilistic currency of social evolution, and you may discover surprising equivalences.",

            "problem": "In a large, randomly mating, diploid population with no inbreeding and no assortative mating, consider identity by descent (IBD) at a single autosomal locus under Mendelian segregation. The coefficient of relatedness $r_{XY}$ between individuals $X$ and $Y$ is defined as the expected fraction of genes in $X$ and $Y$ that are identical by descent. You may take as a foundational premise that each meiosis transmits a given ancestral allele with probability $1/2$, and that when multiple independent IBD paths exist via distinct, non-inbred common ancestors, their contributions to the probability of identity by descent add.\n\nTask:\n- Compute the coefficient of relatedness $r_{\\text{HS}}$ between half-siblings who share exactly one parent and whose other parents are unrelated to each other and to the shared parent.\n- Compute the coefficient of relatedness $r_{\\text{AN}}$ between an aunt and her niece, where the aunt is the full sibling of the niece’s parent; assume all founders are non-inbred and mutually unrelated.\n- In each case, derive the result from first principles by explicitly enumerating the identity-by-descent paths and their probabilities, using only the premises stated above. Explain any equivalence or difference in the two values in terms of the structure and number of IBD paths.\n\nReport as your final numerical answer the single quantity $r_{\\text{HS}} - r_{\\text{AN}}$ as an exact rational number. Do not round. No units are required.",
            "solution": "We work from the definition of identity by descent (IBD) and Mendelian segregation. Let $g_X$ and $g_Y$ denote alleles sampled uniformly at random from the diploid genotypes of individuals $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The coefficient of relatedness $r_{XY}$ equals the expected fraction of genes identical by descent between $X$ and $Y$. In a diploid, non-inbred setting, it is convenient to compute the coefficient of coancestry $f_{XY} = \\Pr(g_X \\text{ and } g_Y \\text{ are IBD})$ via explicit IBD paths and then use $r_{XY} = 2 f_{XY}$, because each individual carries $2$ genes per autosomal locus and, in the absence of inbreeding, $f_{XY}$ is the probability that one gene from $X$ and one from $Y$ are IBD.\n\nFoundational premises we use:\n- At each meiosis, a given ancestral allele is transmitted with probability $1/2$.\n- If there are multiple independent IBD paths via distinct, non-inbred common ancestors, their contributions add, because the events are mutually exclusive with respect to the identity of the specific ancestral allele from which both sampled genes descend.\n\nCase 1: Half-siblings.\nLet the half-siblings be $S_1$ and $S_2$ who share exactly one parent $P$. Let $U$ be the unrelated other parent of $S_1$ and $V$ be the unrelated other parent of $S_2$. Consider alleles $g_{S_1}$ and $g_{S_2}$ sampled uniformly at random from $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. The only possible IBD path is through the shared parent $P$, since $U$ and $V$ are unrelated to each other and to $P$.\n\nFor $g_{S_1}$ and $g_{S_2}$ to be IBD via $P$, three independent conditions must hold:\n- The sampled allele $g_{S_1}$ must be the allele in $S_1$ inherited from $P$, which occurs with probability $1/2$.\n- The sampled allele $g_{S_2}$ must be the allele in $S_2$ inherited from $P$, which occurs with probability $1/2$.\n- Conditional on both sampled alleles being inherited from $P$, they must trace back to the same allelic copy in $P$. Because $P$ is diploid and non-inbred, the two allelic copies at the locus in $P$ are distinct and each child inherits one or the other with probability $1/2$. Therefore, the probability that both transmissions chose the same allelic copy is $1/2$.\n\nMultiplying these independent probabilities gives the coancestry:\n$$\nf_{\\text{HS}} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\nThus, the coefficient of relatedness is\n$$\nr_{\\text{HS}} \\;=\\; 2 f_{\\text{HS}} \\;=\\; 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nCase 2: Aunt and niece (aunt is a full sibling of the niece’s parent).\nLet the aunt be $A$, the parent of the niece be $P$, and the niece be $N$. Let the two non-inbred, unrelated grandparents common to $A$ and $P$ be $G_1$ and $G_2$. Again sample alleles $g_A$ from $A$ and $g_N$ from $N$ uniformly at random.\n\nHere, there are potentially two independent IBD paths, one through $G_1$ and one through $G_2$, reflecting the full-sibling relationship between $A$ and $P$. We compute the contribution from one grandparent $G$ and then sum over $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n\nFix a grandparent $G$. For $g_A$ and $g_N$ to be IBD via $G$, the following must occur:\n- The sampled allele $g_A$ must descend from $G$. Because $A$ is the child of $G$ (through one meiosis from $G$ to $A$), and we sample one of $A$’s two alleles at random, the probability that $g_A$ is the allele inherited from $G$ is $1/2$.\n- The sampled allele $g_N$ must descend from $G$. This requires two transmissions: from $G$ to $P$ and from $P$ to $N$, each with probability $1/2$, and finally that the sampled allele in $N$ is the one inherited from $P$, again with probability $1/2$. Equivalently, we can account for sampling at the end by noting that the probability a randomly sampled allele in $N$ traces to $G$ through $P$ is $(1/2)\\times(1/2) = 1/4$ (one $1/2$ for the transmission from $G$ to $P$ and one $1/2$ for the sampling of the allele from $N$ that came from $P$).\n- Conditional on both sampled alleles being derived from $G$, they must be copies of the same allelic variant in $G$. Because $G$ is diploid and non-inbred, the probability that both transmissions ultimately pick the same allelic copy is $1/2$.\n\nMultiplying these independent probabilities for a single grandparent $G$ gives\n$$\n\\Pr(\\text{IBD via } G) \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\nBecause $G_1$ and $G_2$ are unrelated and non-inbred founders, the two IBD pathways are independent alternative origins for IBD and thus their contributions add:\n$$\nf_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nr_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; 2 f_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nComparison and path-based explanation:\n- Half-siblings share a single common ancestor (the shared parent) and a single IBD path contributing $\\frac{1}{8}$ to the coancestry, yielding $r_{\\text{HS}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- An aunt and niece (with a full-sibling parent) share two common ancestors (the two grandparents). Each grandparent provides an IBD path of smaller weight $\\frac{1}{16}$ to the coancestry, but the two paths sum to the same total $\\frac{1}{8}$, again yielding $r_{\\text{AN}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The equality arises because the aunt–niece connection has twice as many independent IBD sources (two grandparents) as the half-sibling case (one parent), but each source is attenuated by an extra meiosis, halving the per-path contribution.\n\nHence,\n$$\nr_{\\text{HS}} - r_{\\text{AN}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\;=\\; 0.\n$$",

This problem explores the consequences of inbreeding by asking you to compute the relatedness between siblings whose parents are first cousins.

They have two non-inbred children in generation $2$ who are full siblings. Each of these siblings mates with an unrelated, non-inbred partner to produce two non-inbred first cousins in generation $3$. These two first cousins then mate (a first-cousin mating), producing two offspring in generation $4$. For clarity: the generation-$4$ offspring are the two grandchildren relative to the generation-$2$ sibling pair.\n\nAssume autosomal inheritance with Mendelian segregation, no mutation, and no assortative mating beyond what is explicitly stated. Let the coefficient of kinship (coancestry) $\\phi_{XY}$ be defined as the probability that a randomly sampled autosomal allele from individual $X$ and a randomly sampled autosomal allele from individual $Y$ are identical by descent (Identity By Descent (IBD)). Let the coefficient of inbreeding $F_{X}$ of individual $X$ be the probability that the two autosomal alleles at a locus in $X$ are IBD. For the purposes of inclusive fitness and Hamilton’s rule, take the coefficient of relatedness between two individuals $X$ and $Y$ to be $r_{XY} \\equiv 2\\,\\phi_{XY}$.\n\nUsing only these definitions and Mendelian segregation, compute the coefficient of relatedness between the two generation-$4$ offspring (the two grandchildren relative to generation $2$), and quantify how inbreeding alters relatedness relative to the outbred expectation for full siblings from unrelated parents. Specifically, compute\n$$\\Delta r \\equiv r_{\\text{inbred siblings}} - r_{\\text{outbred full siblings}}.$$\nExpress your final answer for $\\Delta r$ as an exact reduced fraction; do not round.",
            "solution": "The objective is to compute the quantity $\\Delta r \\equiv r_{\\text{inbred siblings}} - r_{\\text{outbred full siblings}}$, which quantifies the change in relatedness between full siblings due to parental consanguinity. The problem defines the coefficient of relatedness between two individuals $X$ and $Y$ as $r_{XY} = 2\\phi_{XY}$, where $\\phi_{XY}$ is the coefficient of kinship.\n\nLet us first establish the general formula for the kinship coefficient, $\\phi_{S_1S_2}$, between two full siblings, $S_1$ and $S_2$, whose parents are $M$ and $F$. A randomly sampled allele from $S_1$ comes from $M$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $F$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The same holds for $S_2$. There are four equally likely events for the origins of a pair of alleles, one from each sibling: from $(M, M)$, from $(F, F)$, from $(M, F)$, or from $(F, M)$. The probability that these two alleles are identical by descent (IBD) is the coefficient of kinship:\n$$ \\phi_{S_1S_2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\phi_{MM} + \\frac{1}{4} \\phi_{FF} + \\frac{1}{4} \\phi_{MF} + \\frac{1}{4} \\phi_{FM} $$\nThe kinship of an individual with itself, $\\phi_{XX}$, is the probability that two alleles sampled with replacement from its gene pool are IBD, which is given by $\\phi_{XX} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + F_{X})$, where $F_X$ is the coefficient of inbreeding. Since kinship is symmetric ($\\phi_{MF} = \\phi_{FM}$), the formula becomes:\n$$ \\phi_{S_1S_2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1+F_M}{2} + \\frac{1+F_F}{2} + 2\\phi_{MF} \\right) $$\nThe coefficient of relatedness between the siblings is then:\n$$ r_{S_1S_2} = 2\\phi_{S_1S_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1+F_M}{2} + \\frac{1+F_F}{2} + 2\\phi_{MF} \\right) = \\frac{1+F_M}{4} + \\frac{1+F_F}{4} + \\phi_{MF} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline relatedness for full siblings from unrelated, non-inbred parents, which we denote $r_{\\text{outbred full siblings}}$. For such parents, $M$ and $F$, we have $F_M = 0$, $F_F = 0$, and $\\phi_{MF} = 0$. Substituting these into the general formula:\n$$ r_{\\text{outbred full siblings}} = \\frac{1+0}{4} + \\frac{1+0}{4} + 0 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the relatedness for the two generation-$4$ offspring, which we denote as $r_{\\text{inbred siblings}}$. Let us denote the individuals in the pedigree as follows:\n-   Generation $1$ (G1): $A$ and $B$ (unrelated, non-inbred). $F_A=0, F_B=0, \\phi_{AB}=0$.\n-   Generation $2$ (G2): $C$ and $D$ (full siblings, children of $A,B$).\n-   Partners for G2: $E$ and $F$ (unrelated, non-inbred).\n-   Generation $3$ (G3): $G$ (child of $C,E$) and $H$ (child of $D,F$). These are first cousins.\n-   Generation $4$ (G4): $O_1$ and $O_2$ (full siblings, children of $G,H$).\n\nWe must compute $r_{O_1O_2}$ using our general formula, where the parents are $G$ and $H$. This requires finding their inbreeding coefficients, $F_G$ and $F_H$, and their kinship coefficient, $\\phi_{GH}$.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient of an individual is equal to the kinship coefficient of its parents.\nThe parents of $G$ are $C$ and $E$. Thus, $F_G = \\phi_{CE}$. Since $E$ is stated to be unrelated to the pedigree, $\\phi_{CE} = 0$. Therefore, $F_G = 0$.\nThe parents of $H$ are $D$ and $F$. Thus, $F_H = \\phi_{DF}$. Since $F$ is stated to be unrelated to the pedigree, $\\phi_{DF} = 0$. Therefore, $F_H = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the kinship coefficient $\\phi_{GH}$ between the first cousins $G$ and $H$. The parents of $G$ are $(C, E)$ and the parents of $H$ are $(D, F)$. The general formula for kinship between two individuals is $\\phi_{XY} = \\frac{1}{4}(\\phi_{P_{XA}P_{YA}} + \\phi_{P_{XA}P_{YB}} + \\phi_{P_{XB}P_{YA}} + \\phi_{P_{XB}P_{YB}})$, where $P$ denotes parents.\n$$ \\phi_{GH} = \\frac{1}{4} (\\phi_{CD} + \\phi_{CF} + \\phi_{ED} + \\phi_{EF}) $$\nSince $E$ and $F$ are unrelated to the family $(A, B, C, D)$ and to each other, the kinship coefficients involving them are zero: $\\phi_{CF} = 0$, $\\phi_{ED} = 0$, $\\phi_{EF} = 0$.\nThe expression simplifies to $\\phi_{GH} = \\frac{1}{4}\\phi_{CD}$.\n\nWe must now find the kinship $\\phi_{CD}$ between the full siblings $C$ and $D$. Their parents are the founders $A$ and $B$, who are non-inbred ($F_A=0, F_B=0$) and unrelated ($\\phi_{AB}=0$). Using the sibling kinship formula:\n$$ \\phi_{CD} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1+F_A}{2} + \\frac{1+F_B}{2} + 2\\phi_{AB} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1+0}{2} + \\frac{1+0}{2} + 2(0) \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nNow we can compute the kinship between the first cousins $G$ and $H$:\n$$ \\phi_{GH} = \\frac{1}{4}\\phi_{CD} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} $$\n\nWe have all the necessary components to calculate $r_{\\text{inbred siblings}} = r_{O_1O_2}$. The parents are $G$ and $H$, with $F_G = 0$, $F_H = 0$, and $\\phi_{GH} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n$$ r_{\\text{inbred siblings}} = \\frac{1+F_G}{4} + \\frac{1+F_H}{4} + \\phi_{GH} = \\frac{1+0}{4} + \\frac{1+0}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\n$$ r_{\\text{inbred siblings}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{9}{16} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta r$:\n$$ \\Delta r = r_{\\text{inbred siblings}} - r_{\\text{outbred full siblings}} = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{16} $$\nThe inbreeding resulting from the first-cousin mating increases the relatedness between the subsequent full siblings by an amount equal to the kinship coefficient of their parents, $\\phi_{GH}$.",

            "solution": "The objective is to obtain unbiased estimates of the causal parameters $b$ and $c$, where $b$ is the effect of one unit of helping $H$ on the recipient's fitness $W_R$, and $c$ is the fitness cost to the actor from one unit of helping $H$. The cost $c$ is defined as the negative of the causal effect of $H$ on the actor's fitness $W_A$.\n\nA simple regression of $W_A$ or $W_R$ on $H$ is insufficient. Such an analysis would be biased by confounding variables. For instance, an actor's intrinsic quality or condition (an unobserved confounder, let us call it $U$) could influence both its propensity to help ($H$) and its own fitness ($W_A$) independent of the helping behavior itself. This creates a non-causal correlation between $H$ and $W_A$. The provided experimental manipulation is the randomization of partner presence, $T \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This randomization is the key to a valid causal estimate, as it creates a variable ($T$) that influences helping ($H$) but is, by design, uncorrelated with any pre-treatment confounders, be they observed ($E$) or unobserved ($U$).\n\nThis setup is a canonical application for an instrumental variable (IV) approach. The randomized partner presence, $T$, serves as an instrument for the endogenous treatment, $H$. For $T$ to be a valid instrument, it must satisfy three core assumptions:\n1.  **Relevance**: $T$ must have a causal effect on $H$. The presence of a partner must, on average, change the level of helping.\n2.  **Independence (Ignorability)**: $T$ must be independent of any unobserved factors $U$ that confound the relationship between $H$ and the outcomes ($W_A, W_R$). Randomization of $T$ ensures this condition holds.\n3.  **Exclusion Restriction**: $T$ must not affect the outcomes ($W_A, W_R$) through any pathway other than its effect on $H$. The mere presence of the partner, independent of the helping it elicits, should not have a direct causal effect on fitness.\n\nA further critical consideration is the avoidance of collider bias. This bias arises from controlling for a variable that is a common effect of two other variables. In this context, any post-treatment variable, such as the duration of vigilance, foraging success during the trial, or even whether cooperation occurred, is a potential collider or a mediator. Conditioning on such variables in a statistical model, or by subsetting the data, can induce spurious correlations and severely bias the estimates of causal effects. To avoid this, analysis must be performed on all subjects as randomized (the intention-to-treat principle), and models must not include post-treatment variables as controls.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A**\nThis option presents a comprehensive and rigorous design.\n-   **Experimental Design**: It proposes to stratify by pre-treatment covariates $E$ and then randomize the treatment assignment $T$ within strata. This is excellent practice. Stratification ensures balance on key observed variables and increases statistical power. Randomizing partner identity is a further refinement that strengthens the exclusion restriction by averaging out any idiosyncratic partner effects.\n-   **Analysis**: It correctly identifies the instrumental variable strategy using two-stage least squares (2SLS) as the appropriate analytical method. The first stage, $H = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 T + \\gamma^{\\top} E + \\varepsilon$, uses the randomized instrument $T$ to generate a prediction of helping, $\\hat{H}$, that is purged of any correlation with unobserved confounders. The second stage, $W_A = \\alpha_A' + \\theta_A H + \\beta_A'^{\\top} E + \\eta_A$ (and similarly for $W_R$), then uses this cleaned version of $H$ (in practice, $\\hat{H}$ is substituted for $H$) to estimate the causal effect. The interpretation of the resulting coefficients, $\\theta_R$ as $b$ and $-\\theta_A$ as $c$, is correct.\n-   **Collider Bias**: The option explicitly and correctly warns against conditioning on post-treatment variables and mandates analyzing all assigned units (intention-to-treat). This demonstrates a correct understanding of how to prevent collider and selection biases.\n-   **Justification**: The reasoning provided for the validity of the instrument (independence via randomization, relevance via manipulation check, exclusion via experimental design) is precise and correct. The inclusion of pre-treatment controls $E$ is correctly justified as a means to improve precision.\n\nThis option describes a state-of-the-art procedure for causal inference in this setting. It is scientifically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B**\nThis option describes an observational study, not a randomized experiment.\n-   **Experimental Design**: \"Allow partners to self-assemble naturally\" means there is no randomization of $T$. Any association found is subject to self-selection bias. Matching on observed covariates $E$ can reduce some confounding but is incapable of addressing confounding from unobserved variables (e.g., an actor's intrinsic cooperativeness or condition).\n-   **Analysis**: The proposed regression model, $W_A = \\alpha_A + \\delta_A T + \\phi_A H + \\beta_A^{\\top} E + \\eta_A$, is misspecified for causal inference. It attempts to estimate the effect of $H$ while \"controlling for\" $T$, but $T$ and $H$ are not independent influences; $T$ is a cause of $H$. Because $H$ is endogenous (correlated with the error term via unobserved confounders), the estimate of $\\phi_A$ will be biased. Furthermore, \"restrict the analysis to cases with confirmed encounters\" and \"control for realized foraging success\" constitute conditioning on post-treatment variables, which introduces collider bias.\n\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed for estimating causal effects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C**\nThis option begins with randomization but then employs a flawed analytical strategy.\n-   **Analysis**: It suggests controlling for post-treatment variables such as \"vigilance duration, encounter success with the partner, and realized foraging success\". This is a textbook example of what not to do. These variables are mediators or colliders. Controlling for them will either block the very causal pathway of interest or induce spurious correlations, leading to biased estimates.\n-   **Data Selection**: \"Exclude trials where the partner failed to elicit any helping\" violates the intention-to-treat principle. This is a form of conditioning on a post-treatment outcome ($H > 0$), which introduces selection bias.\n-   **Covariate Selection**: Selecting covariates $E$ based on a p-value threshold (e.g., five percent level) is poor statistical practice that leads to biased estimates and invalid standard errors. Pre-treatment covariates should be selected based on theoretical considerations before analyzing the data.\n\nThe analysis plan proposed in this option would invalidate the benefits of the initial randomization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D**\nThis option proposes a weak quasi-experimental design.\n-   **Experimental Design**: A \"before-after design without randomization\" is highly susceptible to confounding by any other factors that change over time. Without a contemporaneous control group, one cannot distinguish the effect of the treatment from secular trends (e.g., seasonal changes in food availability or predator density).\n-   **Analysis**: The regression of $\\Delta W_A$ on $\\Delta H$ does not solve the problem of unobserved confounding. Any unobserved factor that changes over time and affects both the change in helping and the change in fitness will bias the estimate. Additionally, controlling for \"number of calls produced and the fraction of time the actor spent vigilant\" during the treatment period is another instance of improperly conditioning on post-treatment variables that are part of or consequences of the behavior $H$.\n\nThis design and analysis are inadequate for establishing causality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only Option A outlines a methodologically sound approach that correctly combines a strong experimental design (randomization) with an appropriate statistical model (instrumental variables) and correctly identifies and avoids critical pitfalls like collider bias and selection bias.",
