A female choosing a mate is engaged in a search problem, which can be modeled using principles from optimal decision theory. This foundational exercise  invites you to derive the expected outcomes of different search strategies, such as the best-of-$n$ or fixed threshold rules. By analyzing these models, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the behavioral algorithms that generate the very patterns of non-random mating we observe in nature.",

            "problem": "A mating female evaluates potential mates whose qualities are random draws from a common distribution. Assume the following foundational setup, which is consistent with optimal foraging logic and risk-neutral fitness accounting in mate choice.\n\n- Male quality, denoted by $q$, is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across encounters with cumulative distribution function $F(q)$ and probability density function $f(q)$. For this problem, suppose $q \\sim \\operatorname{Uniform}(0,1)$ so that $f(q)=1$ on $[0,1]$ and $F(q)=q$ for $q \\in [0,1]$.\n- The female gains fitness benefit equal to the realized mate quality $q$ upon acceptance. Each encounter, whether accepted or rejected, imposes a search cost $c>0$. Assume $0<c<\\tfrac{1}{2}$ so that all optimality conditions below yield admissible thresholds in $[0,1]$ and finite sampling efforts.\n- The female is risk-neutral and aims to maximize expected net fitness, defined as expected mate quality minus total search costs. However, in this exercise you are to report expected mate quality under each decision rule. The search cost $c$ influences the decision rules through optimal parameter choices.\n\nDefine and contrast the following decision rules for intersexual mate choice:\n\n- Best-of-$n$ rule: Precommit to sampling exactly $n$ males and then accept the highest-quality male among those $n$.\n- Sequential search with recall: Sample sequentially, keeping track of the best-so-far quality, and decide after each encounter whether to stop and accept the current best or continue, with the ability to accept the best-so-far male at any time in the future (full recall).\n- Fixed threshold rule: Precommit to a fixed acceptance threshold $\\tau \\in [0,1]$ and accept the first encountered male with quality $q \\ge \\tau$; otherwise, continue searching.\n\nUsing only the assumptions stated above and first principles of expectation and optimal decision-making under risk neutrality, do the following:\n\n1. For the best-of-$n$ rule, choose $n$ to maximize expected net fitness (expected maximum of $n$ i.i.d. draws minus the total search cost $n c$). Then, express the expected mate quality at that optimal $n$ as a function of $c$.\n2. For sequential search with recall, derive the optimal stopping condition based on comparing the expected marginal gain from one more sample to the marginal cost $c$. Express the expected mate quality under the resulting optimal policy as a function of $c$.\n3. For the fixed threshold rule with an arbitrary $\\tau \\in [0,1]$, express the expected mate quality as a function of $\\tau$.\n\nProvide your final answer as three closed-form expressions arranged in a single row matrix in the order: best-of-$n$ (at its optimal $n$), sequential search with recall (at its optimal policy), and fixed threshold (for an arbitrary $\\tau$). No rounding is required, and no units apply. Your final answer must be a single analytic expression as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed exercise in optimal stopping theory, applied to the biological context of mate choice, specifically intersexual selection. The problem is scientifically grounded, as it utilizes standard models from behavioral ecology and decision theory. It is internally consistent, objective, and all provided data and conditions are sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the analysis of each decision rule.\n\nThe quality of a potential mate, $q$, is a random variable drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1]$. The probability density function (PDF) is $f(q)=1$ for $q \\in [0, 1]$, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F(q)=q$ for $q \\in [0, 1]$. Each search encounter has a cost $c$, with $0 < c < \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the Best-of-$n$ rule.\nUnder this rule, a female samples a fixed number $n$ of males and then chooses the one with the highest quality. Let the qualities of the $n$ males be $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$, which are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from $U(0,1)$. The quality of the chosen mate is $Y_n = \\max\\{q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n\\}$. To find the expected quality, $E[Y_n]$, we first derive the CDF of $Y_n$.\n$$F_{Y_n}(y) = P(Y_n \\le y) = P(q_1 \\le y, \\dots, q_n \\le y) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(q_i \\le y) = (F(y))^n = y^n \\quad \\text{for } y \\in [0,1]$$\nThe PDF is the derivative of the CDF: $f_{Y_n}(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(y^n) = n y^{n-1}$.\nThe expected quality is then:\n$$E[Y_n] = \\int_{0}^{1} y f_{Y_n}(y) dy = \\int_{0}^{1} y (n y^{n-1}) dy = n \\int_{0}^{1} y^n dy = n \\left[ \\frac{y^{n+1}}{n+1} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{n}{n+1}$$\nThe total search cost is $nc$. The expected net fitness is $V(n) = E[Y_n] - nc = \\frac{n}{n+1} - nc$. To find the optimal sample size $n^*$, we maximize $V(n)$. Treating $n$ as a continuous variable for optimization, we differentiate $V(n)$ with respect to $n$ and set the derivative to zero.\n$$\\frac{dV}{dn} = \\frac{d}{dn} \\left( \\frac{n}{n+1} - nc \\right) = \\frac{(1)(n+1) - (n)(1)}{(n+1)^2} - c = \\frac{1}{(n+1)^2} - c$$\nSetting $\\frac{dV}{dn} = 0$, we find the optimal $n_{\\text{opt}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{(n_{\\text{opt}}+1)^2} = c \\implies n_{\\text{opt}}+1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} \\implies n_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} - 1$$\nThe problem asks for the expected mate quality at this optimal $n$. We substitute $n_{\\text{opt}}$ back into the expression for $E[Y_n]$.\n$$E[Y_{n_{\\text{opt}}}] = \\frac{n_{\\text{opt}}}{n_{\\text{opt}}+1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} - 1}{(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} - 1) + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}} - 1}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}} = 1 - \\sqrt{c}$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the sequential search with recall rule.\nThis is an optimal stopping problem. The state is the quality of the best mate seen so far, let's call it $x$. The female should continue searching if the expected marginal gain from one more sample exceeds the cost $c$. The expected gain in quality from one more sample is $E[\\max(x, q) - x]$, where $q \\sim U(0,1)$.\n$$E[\\max(x, q)] = \\int_0^1 \\max(x, y) dy = \\int_0^x x dy + \\int_x^1 y dy = x^2 + \\left[\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right]_x^1 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{x^2}{2} = \\frac{x^2+1}{2}$$\nThe expected marginal gain in quality is $G(x) = E[\\max(x, q)] - x = \\frac{x^2+1}{2} - x = \\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^2$.\nThe optimal policy is to stop when this gain is no longer greater than the cost $c$. The indifference point, or reservation threshold $x^*$, is found by setting the gain equal to the cost:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(x^*-1)^2 = c \\implies (x^*-1)^2 = 2c \\implies |x^*-1| = \\sqrt{2c}$$\nSince $x^*$ must be a quality level, $x^* \\le 1$, we have $1-x^* = \\sqrt{2c}$, which gives the optimal stopping threshold $x^* = 1 - \\sqrt{2c}$. The female stops and accepts the best-so-far partner as soon as its quality $x$ satisfies $x \\ge x^*$.\nTo find the expected quality under this policy, let $E(x)$ be the final expected quality given the current best-so-far is $x$. The policy dictates that $E(x) = x$ for $x \\ge x^*$. For $x < x^*$, the female samples again, and the expected quality is updated recursively:\n$$E(x) = E[E(\\max(x,q))] = \\int_0^1 E(\\max(x,y)) dy$$\nSplitting the integral based on the threshold $x^*$:\n$$E(x) = \\int_0^{x^*} E(\\max(x,y)) dy + \\int_{x^*}^1 E(\\max(x,y)) dy$$\nFor $y \\ge x^*$, $\\max(x,y) \\ge x^*$, so $E(\\max(x,y)) = \\max(x,y)$.\n$$E(x) = \\int_0^x E(x) dy + \\int_x^{x^*} E(y) dy + \\int_{x^*}^1 y dy$$\nThis implies $(1-x)E(x) = \\int_x^{x^*} E(y) dy + \\frac{1-(x^*)^2}{2}$. Differentiating with respect to $x$ shows that $E(x)$ is a constant, say $E_0$, for all $x < x^*$. Substituting $E(x) = E_0$ back gives:\n$$(1-x)E_0 = E_0(x^*-x) + \\frac{1-(x^*)^2}{2} \\implies E_0(1-x^*) = \\frac{(1-x^*)(1+x^*)}{2}$$\nFor $x^* < 1$, which is true since $c > 0$, we find $E_0 = \\frac{1+x^*}{2}$.\nSince the search starts with an effective best-so-far of $0 < x^*$, the overall expected quality is $E_0$. Substituting $x^* = 1 - \\sqrt{2c}$:\n$$E_Q = \\frac{1 + (1 - \\sqrt{2c})}{2} = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2c}}{2} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{2}}$$\n\nThird, we analyze the fixed threshold rule.\nThe female accepts the first male encountered whose quality $q$ is greater than or equal to a pre-committed threshold $\\tau \\in [0,1]$. The quality of the accepted mate, $Q_{\\text{acc}}$, is therefore a random draw from the distribution of $q$ conditional on $q \\ge \\tau$.\nThe expected quality is $E[Q_{\\text{acc}}] = E[q | q \\ge \\tau]$.\nThe probability of this condition is $P(q \\ge \\tau) = \\int_\\tau^1 f(q) dq = \\int_\\tau^1 1 dq = 1-\\tau$.\nThe conditional PDF of $q$ given $q \\ge \\tau$ is $f(q|q \\ge \\tau) = \\frac{f(q)}{P(q \\ge \\tau)} = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau}$ for $q \\in [\\tau, 1]$.\nThe expected quality is the mean of this conditional distribution:\n$$E[Q_{\\text{acc}}] = \\int_\\tau^1 q \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-\\tau} dq = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau} \\left[ \\frac{q^2}{2} \\right]_\\tau^1 = \\frac{1}{1-\\tau} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1-\\tau^2}{2(1-\\tau)}$$\nFor $\\tau < 1$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$E[Q_{\\text{acc}}] = \\frac{(1-\\tau)(1+\\tau)}{2(1-\\tau)} = \\frac{1+\\tau}{2}$$\nThis expression also holds in the limit as $\\tau \\to 1$.\n\nIn summary, the three requested expressions for expected mate quality are:\n1. Best-of-$n$ (at optimal $n$): $1 - \\sqrt{c}$\n2. Sequential search with recall (at optimal policy): $1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{2}}$\n3. Fixed threshold (at arbitrary $\\tau$): $\\frac{1+\\tau}{2}$",

It is crucial to understand that even though the traits are expressed in different sexes, a genetic covariance can exist because the underlying autosomal genes are present in and transmitted through both sexes. This covariance can arise from pleiotropy (genes affecting both traits) or linkage disequilibrium (statistical association between genes for the two traits).\n3.  The vector of selection gradients is $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_z, \\beta_p)^{\\top}$.\n    - $\\beta_z = \\partial \\ln \\bar{w}_{m}/\\partial \\bar{z}$. This gradient measures the total force of directional selection on the mean male trait $\\bar{z}$. Since male fitness $w_{m}(z)$ is a composite of viability $v(z)$ and mating success $m(z; \\bar{p})$, this gradient naturally incorporates selection from both sources. The mating success component is the source of sexual selection generated by female choice.\n    - $\\beta_p = \\partial \\ln \\bar{w}_{f}/\\partial \\bar{p}$. This gradient measures the force of direct directional selection on the mean female preference $\\bar{p}$. This selection arises from any direct fitness consequences for a female expressing a certain level of preference, such as energetic costs of mate searching or differential risk of predation, as captured by the function $u(p)$.\n\nExpanding the matrix equation gives the individual response equations:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z} = G_{zz}\\beta_{z} + G_{zp}\\beta_{p}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{p} = G_{pz}\\beta_{z} + G_{pp}\\beta_{p}\n$$\n_These equations show:_\n- The male trait $z$ evolves in response to direct selection on it ($\\beta_z$) and as a correlated response to direct selection on female preference ($\\beta_p$), mediated by the genetic covariance $G_{zp}$.\n- The female preference $p$ evolves in response to direct selection on it ($\\beta_p$) and as a correlated response to selection on the male trait ($\\beta_z$), mediated by the genetic covariance $G_{pz}$. The term $G_{pz}\\beta_{z}$ represents the indirect selection on preference that drives the Fisherian runaway process: selection for males with certain traits causes the preference for those traits to increase as well, because of the genetic correlation between trait and preference.\n\nWith this correct framework established, we evaluate the options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The expected per-generation change in mean traits satisfies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=\\mathbf{G}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=(\\bar{z},\\bar{p})^{\\top}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{G}=\\begin{pmatrix}G_{zz}&G_{zp}\\\\ G_{pz}&G_{pp}\\end{pmatrix}$ contains additive genetic variances ($G_{zz}$ and $G_{pp}$) and the additive genetic covariance $G_{zp}$. The selection gradient is $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=(\\beta_{z},\\beta_{p})^{\\top}$ with $\\beta_{z}=\\partial \\ln \\bar{w}_{m}/\\partial \\bar{z}$ and $\\beta_{p}=\\partial \\ln \\bar{w}_{f}/\\partial \\bar{p}$, so that $\\beta_{z}$ captures both natural viability selection on $z$ (via $\\partial \\ln v/\\partial \\bar{z}$) and sexual selection from mate choice (via $\\partial \\ln m/\\partial \\bar{z}$), whereas $\\beta_{p}$ captures the direct selection on preference (for example, costs in $u(p)$). Correlated evolutionary responses arise through the off-diagonal entries of $\\mathbf{G}$, for example $\\Delta \\bar{z}$ contains the term $G_{zp}\\beta_{p}$ and $\\Delta \\bar{p}$ contains the term $G_{pz}\\beta_{z}$, allowing either trait to evolve indirectly even if its own direct selection gradient is zero.**\nThis option presents the correct equation, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=\\mathbf{G}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. It correctly identifies every term: $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the selection gradient vector. The interpretation of $\\beta_z$ as encompassing both viability (natural) and mating success (sexual) selection is correct. The interpretation of $\\beta_p$ as direct selection on preference is correct. Finally, the explanation of correlated responses arising from the off-diagonal terms of $\\mathbf{G}$ is precise and accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The expected per-generation change in mean traits satisfies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=\\mathbf{P}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, where $\\mathbf{P}$ is the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix of $z$ and $p$. Here $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=(\\beta_{z},\\beta_{p})^{\\top}$ with $\\beta_{z}$ defined only by sexual selection ($\\beta_{z}=\\partial \\ln m/\\partial \\bar{z}$) and $\\beta_{p}$ defined only by the strength of choosiness. Because $z$ and $p$ are sex-limited, the off-diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{P}$ are negligible and do not contribute to correlated responses.**\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, the response to selection depends on the *additive genetic* covariance matrix $\\mathbf{G}$, not the *phenotypic* one $\\mathbf{P}$. Second, $\\beta_z$ is the total selection gradient on the male trait, which must include viability selection. Third, the genetic covariance $G_{zp}$ (not the phenotypic covariance $P_{zp}$) is the relevant term for correlated response, and it is not necessarily zero for sex-limited traits.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The expected per-generation change in mean traits satisfies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=\\mathbf{G}\\,\\mathbf{S}$, where $\\mathbf{S}=(S_{z},S_{p})^{\\top}$ is the vector of selection differentials on $z$ and $p$. The genetic covariance $G_{zp}$ measures the phenotypic correlation induced by mate choice and thus directly encodes sexual selection, so the selection differentials $S_{z}$ and $S_{p}$ need only include natural viability selection.**\nThis option is fundamentally confused. The multivariate breeder's equation relates response to the selection *gradient* $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, not the selection *differential* $\\mathbf{S}$. The relation is $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$, so $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}} = \\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$. The form $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}} = \\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{S}$ is incorrect. Furthermore, the interpretation that $G_{zp}$ \"measures the phenotypic correlation\" and \"encodes sexual selection\" is false. $G_{zp}$ is a genetic parameter, and sexual selection is a component of the selection gradient $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ (and the differential $\\mathbf{S}$). The claim that $\\mathbf{S}$ should only include viability selection is also false; the selection differential measures the consequence of all sources of selection.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The expected per-generation change in mean traits satisfies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=\\mathbf{G}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, but because $z$ and $p$ are expressed in different sexes, $G_{zp}=0$. Therefore, sexual selection on males due to female choice must be represented as a nonzero $\\beta_{p}$ acting on $\\bar{z}$ through $\\Delta \\bar{z} = G_{zz}\\beta_{p}$, while $\\beta_{z}$ represents only natural selection on $\\bar{z}$.**\nThis option makes a critical error by asserting that the genetic covariance $G_{zp}$ must be zero for sex-limited traits. As explained previously, this is false and contradicts a central requirement for the Fisherian runaway process. The subsequent attempt to reformulate the model based on this flawed premise results in a nonsensical equation, $\\Delta \\bar{z} = G_{zz}\\beta_{p}$, which misinterprets the meaning of all terms involved. Sexual selection on males is part of $\\beta_z$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The expected per-generation change in mean traits satisfies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, because the selection gradient fully determines the response under weak selection. Here $\\beta_{z}=\\partial \\ln \\bar{w}_{m}/\\partial \\bar{z}$ and $\\beta_{p}=\\partial \\ln \\bar{w}_{f}/\\partial \\bar{p}$; genetic variances and covariances influence only higher-order corrections and can be ignored to first order in the presence of assortative mating.**\nThis option is incorrect. It entirely omits the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances, $\\mathbf{G}$. The response to selection is not equal to the selection pressure; it is the product of selection pressure and the available heritable variation upon which selection can act. Evolution cannot occur ($\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\bar{x}} = \\boldsymbol{0}$) if there is no additive genetic variance ($\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{0}$), no matter how strong the selection ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\ne \\boldsymbol{0}$). The claim that genetic parameters are higher-order corrections is patently false; they are the central, first-order component that translates selection into an evolutionary response.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
