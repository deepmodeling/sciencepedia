The survivorship function $l(x)$ is defined as the probability of surviving from birth to age $x$, with $l(0) = 1$.

The mathematical formulation constitutes a well-posed initial value problem for a first-order ordinary differential equation. All terms are defined unambiguously, and all necessary constraints and initial conditions are provided. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires direct application of established mathematical principles to a standard biological model. There are no factual unsoundness, non-formalizable concepts, or ill-posed structures.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution follows.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Survivorship Function $l(x)$**\nThe analysis begins with the provided differential equation relating survivorship $l(x)$ to the hazard function $h(x)$:\n$$\nl^{\\prime}(x) = -h(x) l(x)\n$$\nThis equation can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d l(x)}{dx} = -h(x) l(x)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation, which is also separable. We separate the variables by arranging all terms involving $l$ on one side and all terms involving $x$ on the other:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{l(x)} d l(x) = -h(x) dx\n$$\nTo find the function $l(x)$, we integrate both sides. The integral on the left is with respect to $l$, from the initial survivorship $l(0)$ to the survivorship at age $x$, $l(x)$. The integral on the right is with respect to a dummy variable of integration, say $u$, from age $0$ to age $x$.\n$$\n\\int_{l(0)}^{l(x)} \\frac{1}{l} dl = -\\int_0^x h(u) du\n$$\nThe left side evaluates to $\\left[ \\ln|l| \\right]_{l(0)}^{l(x)}$. Since survivorship is a probability, $l(x) \\in [0, 1]$, so we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(l(x)) - \\ln(l(0)) = -\\int_0^x h(u) du\n$$\nUsing the given initial condition $l(0) = 1$, we have $\\ln(l(0)) = \\ln(1) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln(l(x)) = -\\int_0^x h(u) du\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the general solution for $l(x)$ in terms of the cumulative hazard:\n$$\nl(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^x h(u) du\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the specified Gompertz hazard function, $h(u) = a \\exp(bu)$, into the integral.\n$$\n\\int_0^x a \\exp(bu) du = a \\int_0^x \\exp(bu) du\n$$\nThe integral of the exponential function is straightforward:\n$$\na \\left[ \\frac{1}{b} \\exp(bu) \\right]_0^x = \\frac{a}{b} \\left( \\exp(bx) - \\exp(b \\cdot 0) \\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\left( \\exp(bx) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $l(x)$:\n$$\nl(x) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{a}{b} (\\exp(bx) - 1) \\right)\n$$\nThis can be written in the final form:\n$$\nl(x) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{a}{b} (1 - \\exp(bx)) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the survivorship function under the Gompertz model.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Mortality Doubling Time $\\Delta$**\nThe mortality doubling time $\\Delta$ is defined by the equation $h(x+\\Delta) = 2 h(x)$. We are given $h(x) = a \\exp(bx)$. Substituting this functional form into the definition gives:\n$$\na \\exp(b(x+\\Delta)) = 2 \\cdot a \\exp(bx)\n$$\nSince $a > 0$, we can divide both sides by $a$.\n$$\n\\exp(b(x+\\Delta)) = 2 \\exp(bx)\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(u+v)=\\exp(u)\\exp(v)$, we rewrite the left side:\n$$\n\\exp(bx) \\exp(b\\Delta) = 2 \\exp(bx)\n$$\nFor any real $x$, $\\exp(bx) > 0$. Thus, we can divide both sides by $\\exp(bx)$, which isolates the term containing $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\exp(b\\Delta) = 2\n$$\nTo solve for $\\Delta$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(b\\Delta)) = \\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\nb\\Delta = \\ln(2)\n$$\nGiven that $b > 0$, we can divide by $b$ to obtain the final expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{b}\n$$\nThe result is a constant that depends only on the parameter $b$, which represents the rate of exponential increase in mortality with age. This completes the second task.\nThe two derived expressions are compiled into the required matrix format for the final answer.",

It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or trivial. It is a formalizable and solvable problem directly relevant to the core principles of evolutionary biology.\n\n## Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the derivation.\n\n## Derivation\nThe reproductive value, $v(x)$, of an individual of age $x$ is defined as its expected total future contribution to the gene pool, where contributions are measured by the number of offspring produced at future ages, and these contributions are discounted by the population's growth rate $r$.\n\nLet us construct the expression for $v(x)$ from first principles. We consider an individual currently at age $x$. Its future life spans from age $x$ to death. We are interested in its production of offspring over all future ages $a \\ge x$.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal age interval $[a, a+da]$ where $a \\geq x$.\n$1.$ The probability that an individual alive at age $x$ will survive to age $a$ is given by the conditional probability $P(\\text{alive at } a | \\text{alive at } x)$. This is expressed in terms of the survivorship function $l(x)$ as $\\frac{l(a)}{l(x)}$. This is the \"conditioning on survival\" stipulated by the problem.\n\n$2.$ If the individual survives to age $a$, its expected number of offspring produced during the infinitesimal time interval $da$ is $m(a)da$.\n\n$3.$ These offspring are produced at a future time $t = a-x$ relative to the present. In a population growing at a rate $r$, the total number of newborns at time $t$ is $\\exp(rt)$ times the number of newborns at time $0$. Therefore, the relative value of a newborn produced at time $t$ is discounted by a factor of $\\exp(-rt)$. This discount factor is $\\exp(-r(a-x))$.\n\n$4.$ Combining these elements, the expected, discounted contribution to future population growth from the age interval $[a, a+da]$ is the product of survival probability, offspring production, and the discount factor:\n$$ dV = \\left(\\frac{l(a)}{l(x)}\\right) \\cdot (m(a)da) \\cdot \\exp(-r(a-x)) $$\nTo find the total reproductive value $v(x)$, we must sum these infinitesimal contributions over all future ages, from the current age $x$ to the maximum possible age, which is taken as infinity. This summation is performed by integration:\n$$ v(x) = \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\exp(-r(a-x)) \\frac{l(a)}{l(x)} m(a) da $$\nWe can rearrange this expression by factoring out terms that are constant with respect to the integration variable $a$:\n$$ v(x) = \\frac{1}{l(x)} \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) \\exp(rx) l(a) m(a) da $$\n$$ v(x) = \\frac{\\exp(rx)}{l(x)} \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) l(a) m(a) da $$\nThis is the general expression for reproductive value. The problem requires that this expression be normalized such that $v(0)=1$. We must verify if our derived expression satisfies this condition with the given information. Let us evaluate $v(0)$:\n$$ v(0) = \\frac{\\exp(r \\cdot 0)}{l(0)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) l(a) m(a) da $$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given $l(0)=1$ and the Euler-Lotka equation, which states $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) l(a) m(a) da = 1$. Substituting these known values:\n$$ v(0) = \\frac{1}{1} \\cdot (1) = 1 $$\nThe derived expression inherently satisfies the normalization condition. Therefore, it is the correct and final form for the reproductive value $v(x)$. This expression represents the future reproductive output of an individual of age $x$ scaled by its survival probability and the time value of its reproduction in a growing population.",
