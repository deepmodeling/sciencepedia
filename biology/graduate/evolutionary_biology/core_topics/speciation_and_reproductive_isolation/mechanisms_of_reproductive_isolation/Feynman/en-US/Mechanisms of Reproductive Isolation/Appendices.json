            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, logically consistent, and provides sufficient information for a unique solution. The framework for quantifying reproductive isolation ($RI$) is standard in the field of evolutionary genetics. We shall proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe problem defines four discrete stages in the reproductive process and requires the calculation of stage-specific and cumulative reproductive isolation. Let subscript $H$ denote the heterospecific cross and $C$ denote the conspecific cross. The count data for each stage transition is as follows:\n\n- Heterospecific series:\n  - Initial mating attempts: $N_{\\mathrm{attempts, H}} = 100$\n  - Copulations: $N_{\\mathrm{copulations, H}} = 60$\n  - Fertilizations: $N_{\\mathrm{fertilizations, H}} = 10$\n  - Viable offspring: $N_{\\mathrm{offspring, H}} = 4$\n\n- Conspecific series:\n  - Initial mating attempts: $N_{\\mathrm{attempts, C}} = 100$\n  - Copulations: $N_{\\mathrm{copulations, C}} = 95$\n  - Fertilizations: $N_{\\mathrm{fertilizations, C}} = 90$\n  - Viable offspring: $N_{\\mathrm{offspring, C}} = 85$\n\nThe transition probability for a given stage $i$, $p_i$, is the ratio of the number of individuals successfully completing the stage to the number of individuals entering the stage.\n\nThe four stages are defined as:\n1.  **Mating ($I_1$)**: From baseline opportunity to mating attempts.\n2.  **Copulation ($I_2$)**: From attempts to copulations.\n3.  **Gametic ($I_3$)**: From copulations to fertilizations.\n4.  **Intrinsic viability ($I_4$)**: From fertilizations to viable offspring.\n\nWe first calculate the conditional transition probabilities ($p_{\\mathrm{H},i}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{C},i}$) for each stage $i$.\n\n**Stage 1: Mating**\nThe problem defines this stage as the transition from a \"baseline opportunity\" to \"mating attempts\". The number of mating attempts for both series is given as $100$. Let the unstated number of baseline opportunities be $N_{opp}$. As this initial condition is identical for both experimental series, the probabilities are $p_{\\mathrm{H},1} = \\frac{100}{N_{opp}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{C},1} = \\frac{100}{N_{opp}}$. The ratio $\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},1}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},1}} = 1$. The isolation component is $I_1 = 1 - \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},1}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},1}} = 1 - 1 = 0$. This indicates no isolation at this stage, as expected from a controlled experimental design.\n\n**Stage 2: Copulation**\nThis is the probability of copulation, given a mating attempt.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{H},2} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{copulations, H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{attempts, H}}} = \\frac{60}{100} = 0.6 $$\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{C},2} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{copulations, C}}}{N_{\\mathrm{attempts, C}}} = \\frac{95}{100} = 0.95 $$\n\n**Stage 3: Gametic**\nThis is the probability of fertilization, given a copulation.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{H},3} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{fertilizations, H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{copulations, H}}} = \\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{C},3} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{fertilizations, C}}}{N_{\\mathrm{copulations, C}}} = \\frac{90}{95} = \\frac{18}{19} $$\n\n**Stage 4: Intrinsic Viability**\nThis is the probability of producing a viable offspring, given a fertilization.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{H},4} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{offspring, H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{fertilizations, H}}} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 $$\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{C},4} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{offspring, C}}}{N_{\\mathrm{fertilizations, C}}} = \\frac{85}{90} = \\frac{17}{18} $$\n\nThe cumulative reproductive isolation, $I_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is defined as:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{4} (1 - I_i) $$\nwhere $I_i = 1 - \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},i}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},i}}$. This means $(1 - I_i) = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},i}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},i}}$.\nTherefore, the formula for cumulative isolation can be expressed as:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},1}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},1}} \\times \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},2}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},2}} \\times \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},3}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},3}} \\times \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H},4}}{p_{\\mathrm{C},4}} \\right) $$\nThe product of the ratios of conditional probabilities is equivalent to the ratio of the total probabilities of success across all stages. Let $P_H$ and $P_C$ be the total probabilities of producing a viable offspring from a baseline opportunity.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{H}} = p_{\\mathrm{H},1} \\times p_{\\mathrm{H},2} \\times p_{\\mathrm{H},3} \\times p_{\\mathrm{H},4} = \\frac{100}{N_{opp}} \\times \\frac{60}{100} \\times \\frac{10}{60} \\times \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{4}{N_{opp}} $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{C},1} \\times p_{\\mathrm{C},2} \\times p_{\\mathrm{C},3} \\times p_{\\mathrm{C},4} = \\frac{100}{N_{opp}} \\times \\frac{95}{100} \\times \\frac{90}{95} \\times \\frac{85}{90} = \\frac{85}{N_{opp}} $$\nThe product term in the equation for $I_{\\mathrm{total}}$ simplifies to:\n$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{4} (1 - I_i) = \\frac{P_H}{P_C} = \\frac{4/N_{opp}}{85/N_{opp}} = \\frac{4}{85} $$\nThis result can also be obtained by simply taking the ratio of the final number of viable offspring, since the initial number of opportunities was the same for both series.\n\nNow we compute the final value for $I_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - \\frac{4}{85} = \\frac{85 - 4}{85} = \\frac{81}{85} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{total}} = 0.952941176... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $4$, so we do not round up the fourth digit.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx 0.9529 $$\nThis value represents a $95.29\\%$ reduction in reproductive success for the heterospecific cross relative to the conspecific baseline.",

In a given breeding season, imagine an arbitrarily large pool of potential heterospecific reproductive opportunities that we normalize to $1$. A sequence of three barriers acts in series on this pool: a pre-mating behavioral barrier, a postmating–prezygotic gametic barrier, and a postzygotic hybrid viability/fertility barrier. By definition, the strength of barrier $i$, denoted $b_{i}$ with $0 \\leq b_{i} \\leq 1$, is the proportion of the remaining potential heterospecific gene flow eliminated at stage $i$.

It describes a standard and correct model for quantifying sequential reproductive isolation in evolutionary biology, originally formalized by Coyne and Orr. All terms are defined precisely, the data are consistent, and the tasks are solvable and unambiguous. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be constructed.\n\nLet $G_0$ represent the initial pool of potential heterospecific gene flow. As per the problem statement, we normalize this to $G_0 = 1$. Let $S_i$ be the fraction of gene flow that *survives* barrier $i$, and $G_i$ be the magnitude of gene flow remaining after barrier $i$.\n\nThe first barrier, with strength $b_1$, acts on the initial pool $G_0$. The proportion of gene flow that survives this barrier is $S_1 = 1 - b_1$. The amount of gene flow remaining after this barrier is:\n$$G_1 = G_0 \\times S_1 = G_0(1 - b_1)$$\n\nThe second barrier, with strength $b_2$, acts not on the initial pool $G_0$, but on the pool that remains after the first barrier, $G_1$. This is the crucial point derived from the problem's definition of barrier strength and the fundamental rule of conditional probability. The proportion of the *remaining* gene flow that survives this barrier is $S_2 = 1 - b_2$. The amount of gene flow remaining after the second barrier is:\n$$G_2 = G_1 \\times S_2 = G_0(1 - b_1)(1 - b_2)$$\n\nSimilarly, the third barrier, with strength $b_3$, acts on the pool that remains after the second barrier, $G_2$. The proportion of this remaining gene flow that survives is $S_3 = 1 - b_3$. The final amount of gene flow that successfully bypasses all three barriers, which we denote $G_{\\mathrm{final}}$, is:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{final}} = G_2 \\times S_3 = G_0(1 - b_1)(1 - b_2)(1 - b_3)$$\n\nTotal reproductive isolation, $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is defined as the total proportion of the *initial* gene flow, $G_0$, that is eliminated by the sequence of barriers. This is equal to $1$ minus the proportion of gene flow that ultimately survives.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{G_0 - G_{\\mathrm{final}}}{G_0} = 1 - \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{final}}}{G_0}$$\n\nSubstituting our expression for $G_{\\mathrm{final}}$ and using $G_0 = 1$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - \\frac{G_0(1 - b_1)(1 - b_2)(1 - b_3)}{G_0}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - (1 - b_1)(1 - b_2)(1 - b_3)$$\nThis is the general expression for total reproductive isolation for three sequential barriers.\n\nThe reason that simple addition of barrier strengths, i.e., $R_{\\mathrm{total}} \\neq b_1 + b_2 + b_3$, is inappropriate stems directly from this derivation. Each barrier $b_i$ removes a fraction of the gene flow that has survived all preceding barriers, not a fraction of the original total. To see this, let us expand the correct expression:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - (1 - b_1 - b_2 + b_1b_2)(1 - b_3)$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - (1 - b_1 - b_2 + b_1b_2 - b_3 + b_1b_3 + b_2b_3 - b_1b_2b_3)$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 - b_1b_2 - b_1b_3 - b_2b_3 + b_1b_2b_3$$\nThis expression is clearly not equal to the simple sum $b_1 + b_2 + b_3$. The additional negative and positive cross-product terms ($b_ib_j$, $b_1b_2b_3$) account for the overlap in the action of the barriers. Simple addition incorrectly assumes that each barrier acts independently on the full, initial amount of gene flow, thereby overestimating the total isolation by \"double-counting\" the portions of gene flow that would have been blocked by more than one barrier anyway. For example, the contribution of barrier $2$ to the total reduction of gene flow is not $b_2$, but $b_2 \\times (1-b_1)$, because it only acts on the fraction $(1-b_1)$ that passed through barrier $1$. Summing the individual contributions to total isolation gives $R_{\\mathrm{total}} = b_1 + (1-b_1)b_2 + (1-b_1)(1-b_2)b_3$, which is algebraically equivalent to the derived expression and demonstrates that the effect of each barrier is conditional on the previous ones.\n\nNow, we apply the derived formula to the given empirical values: $b_1 = 0.55$, $b_2 = 0.35$, and $b_3 = 0.80$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - (1 - 0.55)(1 - 0.35)(1 - 0.80)$$\nFirst, compute the survival fractions:\n$$1 - b_1 = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45$$\n$$1 - b_2 = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$$\n$$1 - b_3 = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - (0.45 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.20)$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - (0.2925 \\times 0.20)$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1 - 0.0585$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{total}} = 0.9415$$\nThe result $0.9415$ has four significant figures, as required by the problem statement.",

            "problem": "Consider a diploid organism with two biallelic loci, denoted by alleles $A/a$ and $B/b$. Two allopatric parental populations are fixed for different derived alleles at these loci: population $P_{1}$ is fixed for $A A b b$ and population $P_{2}$ is fixed for $a a B B$. Assume standard Mendelian meiosis, random mating where specified, and no viability selection other than a two-locus Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (DMI) that is recessive in its effect at both loci. By \"recessive–recessive DMI,\" we mean that the incompatibility reduces relative fitness by a fraction $s$ only in individuals that are homozygous for both derived alleles $A$ and $B$, i.e., genotype $A A B B$ has relative fitness $1 - s$, while all other genotypes have relative fitness $1$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population and evolutionary genetics, specifically the Dobzhansky–Muller model of postzygotic isolation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with all necessary parameters and conditions clearly defined. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. Thus, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the expected mean relative fitness, $\\bar{w}$, for four types of crosses. The mean relative fitness of a population is given by the sum of the fitness of each genotype weighted by its frequency: $\\bar{w} = \\sum_{i} f_{i} w_{i}$.\nThe problem specifies a recessive-recessive Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (DMI), where only the genotype $A A B B$ has reduced relative fitness, $w_{AABB} = 1 - s$. All other genotypes have a relative fitness of $1$. The mean fitness can therefore be calculated as:\n$$ \\bar{w} = (1 - f(A A B B)) \\times 1 + f(A A B B) \\times (1 - s) = 1 - f(A A B B) + f(A A B B) - s \\cdot f(A A B B) $$\n$$ \\bar{w} = 1 - s \\cdot f(A A B B) $$\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the expected frequency of the $A A B B$ genotype, $f(A A B B)$, in each of the specified generations. The parental populations are $P_{1}$ with genotype $A A b b$ and $P_{2}$ with genotype $a a B B$.\n\nFirst, we consider the $F_{1}$ generation. This generation is produced by crossing the two parental populations: $P_{1}(A A b b) \\times P_{2}(a a B B)$. The $P_{1}$ parent produces only $A b$ gametes, and the $P_{2}$ parent produces only $a B$ gametes. Consequently, all individuals in the $F_{1}$ generation will have the genotype $A a B b$. The frequency of the $A A B B$ genotype is therefore $f_{F1}(A A B B) = 0$. The mean relative fitness of the $F_{1}$ generation is:\n$$ \\bar{w}_{F1} = 1 - s \\cdot f_{F1}(A A B B) = 1 - s \\cdot 0 = 1 $$\n\nSecond, we analyze the $F_{2}$ generation, produced by randomly mating $F_{1}$ individuals: $F_{1}(A a B b) \\times F_{1}(A a B b)$. The $F_{1}$ individuals are heterozygous at both loci with the alleles in repulsion phase (or trans), since their genotype is formed from $A b$ and $a B$ gametes. The chromosomal arrangement is thus $A b / a B$. The recombination fraction between the loci is $r$. An $F_{1}$ individual produces four types of gametes with the following frequencies:\n- Parental gametes: $f(A b) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$ and $f(a B) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n- Recombinant gametes: $f(A B) = \\frac{r}{2}$ and $f(a b) = \\frac{r}{2}$.\nThe incompatible genotype $A A B B$ is formed by the fusion of two $A B$ gametes. Under random mating, the expected frequency of this genotype is the product of the gamete frequencies:\n$$ f_{F2}(A A B B) = f(A B) \\times f(A B) = \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right) = \\frac{r^{2}}{4} $$\nThe mean relative fitness of the $F_{2}$ generation is:\n$$ \\bar{w}_{F2} = 1 - s \\cdot f_{F2}(A A B B) = 1 - s \\frac{r^{2}}{4} $$\n\nThird, we examine the backcross to the $P_{1}$ parent (BC1), which is the cross $F_{1}(A a B b) \\times P_{1}(A A b b)$. To produce an offspring with the $A A B B$ genotype, it must inherit an $A B$ gamete from each parent. The $P_{1}$ parent has genotype $A A b b$ and can only produce $A b$ gametes. It cannot provide a $B$ allele. Therefore, it is impossible to form a $B B$ homozygote, and thus impossible to form the $A A B B$ genotype. The frequency of the $A A B B$ genotype is $f_{BC1}(A A B B) = 0$. The mean relative fitness is:\n$$ \\bar{w}_{BC1} = 1 - s \\cdot f_{BC1}(A A B B) = 1 - s \\cdot 0 = 1 $$\n\nFourth, we examine the backcross to the $P_{2}$ parent (BC2), which is the cross $F_{1}(A a B b) \\times P_{2}(a a B B)$. To produce an offspring with the $A A B B$ genotype, the offspring must be homozygous for the $A$ allele. This requires inheriting an $A$ allele from each parent. The $P_{2}$ parent has genotype $a a B B$ and can only produce $a B$ gametes. It cannot provide an $A$ allele. Therefore, it is impossible to form an $A A$ homozygote, and thus impossible to form the $A A B B$ genotype. The frequency of the $A A B B$ genotype is $f_{BC2}(A A B B) = 0$. The mean relative fitness is:\n$$ \\bar{w}_{BC2} = 1 - s \\cdot f_{BC2}(A A B B) = 1 - s \\cdot 0 = 1 $$\n\nIn summary, the expected mean relative fitness for the four crosses are $(\\bar{w}_{F1}, \\bar{w}_{F2}, \\bar{w}_{BC1}, \\bar{w}_{BC2})$.\n\nFinally, for the interpretation, the derived pattern of fitness—no reduction in the $F_{1}$ or backcross generations, but a reduction in the $F_{2}$—is the quintessential signature of a recessive-recessive DMI. The $F_{1}$ is shielded by heterozygosity. The backcrosses are shielded because each parental population is homozygous for an ancestral allele (at one of the two loci), which prevents the formation of the doubly derived homozygous genotype ($A A B B$). Fitness breakdown occurs only in the $F_{2}$ generation, where recombination can produce $A B$ gametes that can then combine to form the incompatible $A A B B$ genotype. The severity of this breakdown depends on the recombination rate $r$, being most severe for unlinked loci ($r=1/2$) and absent for completely linked loci ($r=0$). This theoretical pattern is the benchmark expectation for this type of genetic incompatibility and is consistent with empirical findings in speciation genetics.",
