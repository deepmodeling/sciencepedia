            "introduction": "A cornerstone of sympatric speciation theory is the role of disruptive selection, a powerful evolutionary engine that can drive a population towards genetic divergence. When intermediate phenotypes are less fit than extreme ones, selection actively works against hybrids. This exercise provides a foundational, quantitative look at this process, allowing you to calculate the change in allele frequency in a single generation under disruptive selection, even when mating remains random. By working through this model , you will gain a hands-on appreciation for how selection against heterozygotes can initiate a split within a population.",

            "problem": "In an isolated crater lake, a population of cichlid fish exhibits a polymorphism for jaw morphology, which is critical for feeding. This trait is controlled by a single genetic locus with two co-dominant alleles, $A_1$ and $A_2$. The genotype $A_1A_1$ results in a \"benthic\" morph, highly adapted for scraping algae from rocks. The genotype $A_2A_2$ results in a \"limnetic\" morph, adapted for catching zooplankton in the open water column. The heterozygous genotype $A_1A_2$ produces an \"intermediate\" morph that is less efficient at both feeding strategies.\n\nDue to this difference in foraging efficiency, the morphs have different survival rates from the zygote stage to reproductive adulthood. The survival probabilities are:\n- Benthic ($A_1A_1$): $S_1 = 0.90$\n- Limnetic ($A_2A_2$): $S_2 = 0.90$\n- Intermediate ($A_1A_2$): $S_{12} = 0.75$\n\nAt the beginning of a generation, the population of newly formed zygotes is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with the frequency of the $A_1$ allele being $p_0 = 0.40$. Selection occurs as the fish grow to adulthood. The surviving adults then mate randomly to produce the zygotes of the next generation.\n\nCalculate the frequency of the $A_1$ allele in the zygote population of the subsequent generation.

            "solution": "Sympatric speciation requires the evolution of reproductive isolation without geographic separation. Reproductive barriers are classified as prezygotic (preventing mating or fertilization) or postzygotic (reducing hybrid viability or fertility after fertilization). Common prezygotic barriers include behavioral isolation, temporal isolation, mechanical isolation, gametic isolation, and ecological or habitat isolation. Postzygotic barriers include reduced hybrid viability, reduced hybrid fertility, and hybrid breakdown.\n\nScenario A analysis:\n- Event described: a chromosomal mutation creates a polyploid lineage that remains morphologically and behaviorally identical to the ancestral diploid insects and continues to live on the same host (Plant X).\n- Principle: Crosses between individuals with different ploidy levels (e.g., diploid and polyploid) typically produce offspring with unbalanced chromosome sets that fail to pair properly during meiosis. This leads to sterility or markedly reduced fertility in hybrids.\n- Therefore, the initial barrier is a cytogenetic incompatibility manifesting after fertilization, i.e., a postzygotic barrier specifically characterized by reduced hybrid fertility.\n- Not prezygotic: Since morphology, behavior, and habitat use are unchanged and shared, prezygotic mechanisms like behavioral, mechanical, temporal, or ecological isolation are not the initial cause of isolation here.\n\nScenario B analysis:\n- Event described: a subset evolves a strong genetic preference to feed and mate exclusively on Plant Y, while the ancestral population remains on Plant X.\n- Principle: Mating site fidelity tied to host plant use produces assortative mating through spatial and ecological segregation within the same geographic area. Individuals on different hosts rarely encounter one another to mate.\n- Therefore, the initial barrier is prezygotic ecological (habitat) isolation, because host preference directly reduces interbreeding opportunities before fertilization.\n- Not postzygotic: The scenario does not posit any intrinsic developmental problems in hybrids; the separation arises from differential host use and mating site choice.\n\nEliminating alternatives:\n- A is incorrect because Scenario A is not driven by prezygotic behavioral isolation, and Scenario B is not initially postzygotic.\n- C is incorrect because Scenario A is not mechanical isolation, and Scenario B is not temporal isolation.\n- D is incorrect because hybrid breakdown concerns later-generation incompatibilities, not the initial barrier in Scenario A; Scenario B is not postzygotic.\n- E is incorrect because Scenario A is not gametic isolation (fertilization can occur but yields sterile hybrids), and Scenario B is better characterized as ecological/habitat isolation rather than purely behavioral, given the host-associated mating site segregation.\n\nThus, Scenario A: postzygotic (reduced hybrid fertility); Scenario B: prezygotic (ecological isolation), which corresponds to option B.",

            "introduction": "The ultimate test of any speciation model lies in its ability to be verified in nature. However, demonstrating true sympatric speciation is notoriously difficult, as one must rigorously exclude the possibility of fine-scale spatial or temporal segregation, a phenomenon known as micro-allopatry. This advanced problem  moves from abstract theory to practical application, asking you to design a field and genomic sampling strategy. Your goal is to devise a study that can powerfully distinguish true reproductive isolation between co-occurring ecotypes from divergence maintained simply by subtle separation in space or time.",

            "problem": "In postglacial lakes, benthic–limnetic three-spined sticklebacks are often used as a model for studying ecological divergence. A persistent inferential challenge is distinguishing micro-allopatric divergence along a depth gradient (individuals effectively isolated by consistent spatial segregation across depth, possibly with temporal segregation during breeding) from true sympatric divergence (individuals of diverging ecotypes occurring in fine-scale syntopy at the same depths and times but maintaining reproductive isolation via assortative mating or strong disruptive selection). Assume the following foundational facts and definitions: gene flow reduces genome-wide divergence, isolation by distance causes genetic distance to increase with geographic separation, isolation by environment predicts genetic distance increases with environmental dissimilarity even when geographic distance is controlled, and the Wahlund effect inflates apparent heterozygote deficits when samples pool reproductively isolated groups. Assume you can collect genomes at thousands of loci, phenotype trophic morphology, assay diet via stable isotopes, and locate nests during the breeding season.\n\nWhich within-lake sampling design would most powerfully and cleanly discriminate micro-allopatric divergence along depth from true sympatric divergence, while minimizing confounding by spatial structure and time?\n\nA. Establish $r = 3$ to $r = 5$ replicate perpendicular transects from shore to pelagic across the lake. Along each transect, collect adults and active nests in $k = 4$ to $k = 6$ narrowly spaced depth strata (e.g., stratum thickness $\\leq 1~\\mathrm{m}$), with $n \\geq 30$ genotyped adults per stratum per transect, and $n \\geq 20$ nests per stratum. Sample on $t = 3$ evenly spaced dates spanning the breeding season. In each transect and date, perform paired syntopic collections at the same depth and time wherever both ecomorphs co-occur (identified by morphology and diet). For each adult pair $i,j$, quantify pairwise genetic distance and annotate (i) horizontal distance along transect, (ii) absolute depth difference, and (iii) ecotype labels based on morphology and isotopes. Conduct paternity assignments for nests to identify mating pairs within and across ecotypes at each depth and time. Repeat the transects in a second lake as a replicate. Use these data to test whether residual genome-wide divergence and assortative mating persist in syntopy after accounting for depth and horizontal distance.\n\nB. At the single deepest basin of the lake, collect one limnetic sample from the metalimnion ($n = 50$) and one benthic sample from the littoral ($n = 50$) on a single day. Estimate $F_{\\text{ST}}$ between these two samples and, if large, conclude sympatric divergence because both samples are from the same lake.\n\nC. Sample across $10$ lakes with known benthic–limnetic pairs, taking one pooled sample per ecotype per lake ($n = 40$ per pool), and compare within-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$ to among-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$. Infer sympatric divergence within lakes if within-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$ exceeds among-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$.\n\nD. In the laboratory, perform mate-choice trials using fish collected from shallow ($\\leq 2~\\mathrm{m}$) and deep ($\\geq 6~\\mathrm{m}$) habitats during a single week, with $n = 30$ trials per cross. If assortative mating is detected in the lab, infer sympatric divergence in the wild.\n\nE.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid scientific question concerning experimental design in evolutionary biology. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no logical or factual flaws. The core challenge is to empirically distinguish true sympatric divergence from micro-allopatric divergence. True sympatry requires demonstrating that reproductive isolation is maintained between ecotypes even when they co-occur in the same place at the same time (syntopy). Micro-allopatry posits that the ecotypes are simply segregated by space (e.g., depth) or time, and this separation is the primary barrier to gene flow. A successful experimental design must therefore simultaneously quantify spatial distributions, temporal distributions, reproductive behavior, and genetic divergence at a fine scale.\n\nLet us evaluate each option.\n\nA. This option proposes a hierarchical and comprehensive sampling design.\n- **Spatial Structure**: The use of $r = 3$ to $r = 5$ replicate transects provides statistical power and controls for idiosyncrasies of any single location within the lake. Sampling along $k = 4$ to $k = 6$ narrow depth strata on each transect directly maps the genetic and ecological variation onto the key environmental gradient (depth). Recording horizontal distance allows for statistical correction of isolation by distance (IBD).\n- **Temporal Structure**: Sampling on $t = 3$ distinct dates across the breeding season directly tests for temporal segregation of reproductive activity, a key component of the micro-allopatry hypothesis.\n- **Syntopy Test**: Critically, the design includes \"paired syntopic collections at the same depth and time\". This isolates the exact scenario where the two hypotheses make different predictions. In these syntopic samples, the micro-allopatry hypothesis predicts random mating, whereas the true sympatry hypothesis predicts assortative mating.\n- **Reproductive Isolation**: The design employs the most direct and powerful method to assess reproductive isolation in the wild: \"paternity assignments for nests to identify mating pairs\". This measures *realized* mating patterns, not just mate choice potential.\n- **Genetic and Phenotypic Data**: Collection of genome-wide data, morphology, and stable isotopes allows for robust classification of individuals into ecomorphs (benthic, limnetic, hybrid) and for quantifying divergence.\n- **Analytical Approach**: The proposed analysis—\"test whether residual genome-wide divergence and assortative mating persist in syntopy after accounting for depth and horizontal distance\"—is precisely the correct statistical procedure. It seeks to partition the variance in divergence and mating patterns into components due to spatial separation versus those intrinsic to the ecotypes when space is controlled for.\n- **Replication**: The suggestion to repeat the study in a second lake adds another level of replication, strengthening the generality of any conclusions.\n\nThis design is rigorous, multifaceted, and directly tailored to disentangle the confounding effects of fine-scale spatial and temporal structure from true reproductive isolation in syntopy.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. This option suggests collecting two bulk samples, one limnetic and one benthic, on a single day and calculating the fixation index, $F_{\\text{ST}}$. This design is fundamentally flawed. The two samples are, by definition, collected from different habitats (littoral vs. metalimnion) and are thus spatially segregated. A significant $F_{\\text{ST}}$ value would indicate genetic differentiation between these two locations, which is an expected outcome under *both* micro-allopatry and sympatry. It provides no information to distinguish whether the differentiation is caused by the spatial separation itself (micro-allopatry) or by reproductive barriers that operate even in the absence of spatial separation (sympatry). The conclusion that a high $F_{\\text{ST}}$ in the \"same lake\" implies sympatry is a logical error, as it ignores the critical role of fine-scale spatial structure within the lake.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option proposes comparing within-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$ to among-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$ across $10$ lakes. The premise that sympatric divergence is supported if within-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$ exceeds among-lake $F_{\\text{ST}}$ is biologically nonsensical. Divergence between populations in separate lakes, which have been isolated for thousands of years, will almost certainly be far greater than divergence between ecotypes within a single lake. Furthermore, like option B, this design uses pooled samples for each ecotype within a lake, thereby completely averaging over and ignoring the crucial fine-scale spatial information. It cannot test for reproductive isolation in syntopy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option proposes laboratory mate-choice trials with fish collected from shallow ($\\leq 2~\\mathrm{m}$) and deep ($\\geq 6~\\mathrm{m}$) habitats. While demonstrating assortative mating in a lab setting is evidence for a pre-zygotic reproductive barrier, it is insufficient to distinguish the hypotheses. The artificial lab environment may not reflect natural behavior. More importantly, even if strong assortative mating potential exists, this does not prove that the populations are sympatric in the wild. They could still be perfectly allopatric (spatially segregated by depth), in which case this behavioral barrier is never actually tested in nature. To support true sympatry, one must demonstrate both co-occurrence *and* reproductive isolation in the natural habitat. This design only addresses a potential for isolation and provides no information about co-occurrence.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. This option suggests using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to track fish movement. This method directly addresses the question of spatial overlap and habitat fidelity. It can determine whether the ecotypes have the opportunity to interact. However, it provides no genetic or reproductive data. If the fish demonstrate significant spatial overlap (inferred as \"sympatry\" by the option's logic), this design cannot determine whether they are interbreeding freely or are maintaining reproductive isolation through assortative mating. It measures the opportunity for gene flow but not the gene flow itself or the barriers to it. Therefore, it cannot, on its own, distinguish a single panmictic population with resource polymorphism from a system of two sympatric, reproductively isolated species.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that proposes a design capable of rigorously and cleanly discriminating between micro-allopatric and true sympatric divergence. It integrates fine-grained spatial and temporal sampling with direct observation of reproductive behavior and its genetic consequences, allowing for a statistical test that directly addresses the core question.",
