Instead, speciation is a cumulative process built from multiple, often incomplete, prezygotic and postzygotic barriers. This exercise  provides a foundational quantitative framework for understanding how the individual effects of different isolating barriers combine to produce a total level of reproductive isolation, contrasting a robust multiplicative model with a simpler additive approximation.",

            "problem": "Under the Biological Species Concept (BSC), species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. Consider three independent reproductive isolation barriers acting sequentially between two populations: temporal isolation, behavioral isolation, and hybrid viability reduction. Each barrier is characterized by a strength $I_{i}$ interpreted as the fractional reduction in potential gene flow attributable to that barrier when acting alone on a normalized scale where the baseline gene exchange is $1$. Assume that independence means that the realized gene exchange after multiple barriers equals the product of the residual gene exchange after each barrier, and that overall reproductive isolation equals one minus the realized gene exchange. Also consider the first-order additive approximation that becomes valid when individual barrier strengths are small, which retains only the leading linear term in a series expansion.\n\nYou are given $I_{\\text{temporal}}=0.3$, $I_{\\text{behavioral}}=0.4$, and $I_{\\text{hybrid viability}}=0.5$.\n\n- Using only the assumptions above and first principles, derive the combined reproductive isolation under the multiplicative barrier model, and the first-order additive approximation obtained by summing individual barrier strengths.\n- Compute the absolute difference between these two estimates.\n\nReport the absolute difference as a pure number, rounded to four significant figures. Do not include any units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis and comparison of two models for calculating combined reproductive isolation from individual isolation barriers. We begin by formalizing the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\nLet $I_i$ be the strength of the $i$-th reproductive isolation barrier. This is defined as the fractional reduction in potential gene flow. The initial, unobstructed gene flow is normalized to $1$.\nThe residual gene flow, $G_i$, after the action of a single barrier $i$ is therefore given by:\n$$G_i = 1 - I_i$$\n\nThe problem states there are three independent barriers acting sequentially: temporal isolation ($I_1$), behavioral isolation ($I_2$), and hybrid viability reduction ($I_3$). The given values are:\n$I_1 = I_{\\text{temporal}} = 0.3$\n$I_2 = I_{\\text{behavioral}} = 0.4$\n$I_3 = I_{\\text{hybrid viability}} = 0.5$\n\nFirst, we derive the combined reproductive isolation under the multiplicative barrier model, which we denote as $I_{\\text{total, mult}}$. The problem states that for independent barriers, the realized gene exchange (which we denote $G_{\\text{total}}$) is the product of the residual gene exchanges for each barrier.\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} G_i = (1 - I_1)(1 - I_2)(1 - I_3)$$\n\nThe overall reproductive isolation is defined as one minus the realized gene exchange.\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = 1 - G_{\\text{total}} = 1 - (1 - I_1)(1 - I_2)(1 - I_3)$$\nThis is the general formula for the multiplicative model.\n\nNext, we consider the first-order additive approximation, which we denote as $I_{\\text{total, add}}$. The problem defines this as the sum of the individual barrier strengths.\n$$I_{\\text{total, add}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} I_i = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$$\n\nTo demonstrate that the additive model is indeed a first-order approximation of the multiplicative model, we can perform a series expansion of the expression for $I_{\\text{total, mult}}$.\nExpanding the product:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(1 - I_1)(1 - I_2)(1 - I_3) &= (1 - I_1 - I_2 + I_1I_2)(1 - I_3) \\\\\n&= 1 - I_1 - I_2 + I_1I_2 - I_3 + I_1I_3 + I_2I_3 - I_1I_2I_3 \\\\\n&= 1 - (I_1 + I_2 + I_3) + (I_1I_2 + I_1I_3 + I_2I_3) - I_1I_2I_3\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $I_{\\text{total, mult}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = 1 - [1 - (I_1 + I_2 + I_3) + (I_1I_2 + I_1I_3 + I_2I_3) - I_1I_2I_3]$$\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = (I_1 + I_2 + I_3) - (I_1I_2 + I_1I_3 + I_2I_3) + I_1I_2I_3$$\nWhen the individual barrier strengths $I_i$ are small (i.e., $I_i \\ll 1$), the higher-order terms involving products of $I_i$ (e.g., $I_1I_2$) are negligible compared to the linear terms. Retaining only the leading linear term gives the first-order approximation:\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} \\approx I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = I_{\\text{total, add}}$$\nThis confirms the relationship described in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for both models using the given data.\nFor the multiplicative model:\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = 1 - (1 - 0.3)(1 - 0.4)(1 - 0.5)$$\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = 1 - (0.7)(0.6)(0.5)$$\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = 1 - (0.42)(0.5)$$\n$$I_{\\text{total, mult}} = 1 - 0.21 = 0.79$$\n\nFor the additive model:\n$$I_{\\text{total, add}} = 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.5$$\n$$I_{\\text{total, add}} = 1.2$$\n\nFinally, we compute the absolute difference, $\\Delta I$, between these two estimates.\n$$\\Delta I = |I_{\\text{total, mult}} - I_{\\text{total, add}}|$$\n$$\\Delta I = |0.79 - 1.2|$$\n$$\\Delta I = |-0.41| = 0.41$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta I = 0.4100$$\nThe significant discrepancy arises because the individual barrier strengths are not small, which violates the condition under which the additive approximation is valid. The additive model nonsensically predicts an isolation value greater than $1$, whereas the multiplicative model is correctly bounded.",

Consider two allopatric populations of freshwater fish, Population 1 (P1) and Population 2 (P2), that have diverged from a common ancestral population. The ancestral population was genetically fixed with genotype $A_1A_1 B_1B_1$. Through evolutionary time, a new allele $A_2$ arose and fixed in P1, while a new allele $B_2$ arose and fixed in P2.

In the focal population, a quantitative premating isolation trait $a \\ge 0$ parameterizes the strength of assortative mating. Assume a widely used diminishing-returns reduction in heterospecific mating risk with increasing assortative mating, such that the probability a random mating is heterospecific is\n$$\nh(a) = m \\exp(-a),\n$$\nso that $h(0)=m$ and $\\frac{d h}{d a} = - m \\exp(-a)$.\n\nAssume mating opportunities are not limiting apart from heterospecific encounters, conspecific matings yield expected viability $1$, and hybrid matings yield expected viability $1-s$.

Substituting this expression for $h(a)$ into our simplified fitness function gives:\n$$\nW(a) = 1 - s m \\exp(-a)\n$$\nThe selection gradient, $\\beta(a)$, is defined as the partial derivative of the natural logarithm of mean fitness with respect to the trait $a$:\n$$\n\\beta(a) = \\frac{\\partial \\ln W(a)}{\\partial a}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, which states that $\\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(u(x)) = \\frac{1}{u(x)} \\frac{du(x)}{dx}$, we find:\n$$\n\\beta(a) = \\frac{1}{W(a)} \\frac{\\partial W(a)}{\\partial a}\n$$\nWe must now compute the partial derivative of $W(a)$ with respect to $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W(a)}{\\partial a} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left[ 1 - s m \\exp(-a) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivative of the constant $1$ is $0$.
