            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n- A large, randomly mating population.\n- Two quantitative traits, $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$.\n- Additive genetic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Linear selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Standard quantitative-genetic conditions for short-term evolutionary change under weak selection and additivity.\n- Traits are measured on a standardized scale where variances are dimensionless.\n- The objective is to compute the expected one-generation change in the mean trait vector, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, and interpret the correlated response in trait $z_{2}$.\n- The final numerical answer must be the exact entries of $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$ provided as a row vector.\n\nValidation assessment:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the standard framework of multivariate evolutionary quantitative genetics, specifically the Lande-Arnold model. The fundamental equation governing the response to selection is well-established. The provided additive genetic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ is symmetric and positive definite (its eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1}=1.5$ and $\\lambda_{2}=0.5$, which are both positive), a necessary condition for a valid covariance matrix. The selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is structured to test a classic scenario of direct selection on one trait and a correlated response in another. The problem is well-posed, objective, and complete. All parameters are defined and consistent. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds.\n\nThe expected one-generation change in the vector of mean phenotypic traits, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, under directional selection is described by the multivariate breeder's equation, also known as the Lande equation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\bar{z}_{1} \\\\ \\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ represents the vector of evolutionary responses for traits $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_{1} \\\\ \\beta_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of linear selection gradients, where each element $\\beta_{i}$ quantifies the direct force of selection on trait $z_{i}$.\n\nThe given matrices are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} G_{11} & G_{12} \\\\ G_{21} & G_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_{1} \\\\ \\beta_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix are the additive genetic variance of trait $1$ ($G_{11}=1$), the additive genetic variance of trait $2$ ($G_{22}=1$), and the additive genetic covariance between them ($G_{12}=G_{21}=0.5$). The selection gradient vector indicates positive direct selection on trait $z_{1}$ ($\\beta_{1}=0.2$) and no direct selection on trait $z_{2}$ ($\\beta_{2}=0$).\n\nTo compute the response to selection, we perform the matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta \\bar{z}_{1} \\\\ \\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.5 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe calculation for each component of the response vector is as follows:\nFor trait $z_{1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_{1} = G_{11}\\beta_{1} + G_{12}\\beta_{2} = (1)(0.2) + (0.5)(0) = 0.2\n$$\nFor trait $z_{2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} = G_{21}\\beta_{1} + G_{22}\\beta_{2} = (0.5)(0.2) + (1)(0) = 0.1\n$$\nThus, the expected one-generation change in the mean trait vector is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2 \\\\ 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nInterpretation of the correlated response:\nThe change in the mean of the second trait, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2}$, is $0.1$. This is a \"correlated response\" to selection. There is no direct selection acting on trait $z_{2}$, as indicated by $\\beta_{2}=0$. The response in $z_{2}$ is entirely due to selection acting on trait $z_{1}$, mediated by the genetic covariance between the two traits.\n\nThe formula for the response of trait $z_{2}$, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} = G_{21}\\beta_{1} + G_{22}\\beta_{2}$, explicitly shows this. Since $\\beta_{2}=0$, the expression simplifies to $\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2} = G_{21}\\beta_{1}$. The positive genetic covariance ($G_{21}=0.5$) means that alleles that tend to increase the value of trait $z_{1}$ also tend to increase the value of trait $z_{2}$ (genetic pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium). Because selection is favoring an increase in trait $z_{1}$ (as $\\beta_{1}=0.2 > 0$), individuals with higher values of $z_{1}$ are selected. These selected individuals pass on their genes to the next generation. Due to the positive genetic covariance, these genes also carry the tendency for higher values of $z_{2}$. Consequently, the mean of trait $z_{2}$ increases in the next generation, even though it was not a direct target of selection.\n\nThe sign of the correlated response is positive, which is the product of the sign of the genetic covariance ($G_{21} > 0$) and the sign of the selection gradient on the directly selected trait ($\\beta_{1} > 0$). The magnitude of the correlated response in $z_{2}$ is $0.1$, which is half the magnitude of the direct response in $z_{1}$ ($\\Delta \\bar{z}_{1}=0.2$). This specific ratio is determined by the ratio of the genetic covariance to the genetic variance of the directly selected trait: $\\frac{\\Delta \\bar{z}_{2}}{\\Delta \\bar{z}_{1}} = \\frac{G_{21}\\beta_{1}}{G_{11}\\beta_{1}} = \\frac{G_{21}}{G_{11}} = \\frac{0.5}{1} = 0.5$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as a well-posed and scientifically sound problem in evolutionary quantitative genetics. All required data are provided, and the matrices are physically and mathematically consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two fundamental equations in multivariate quantitative genetics and their application to a specific numerical case. The first relates the directional selection gradient vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, to the selection differential vector, $\\mathbf{S}$, and the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{P}$. The second relates the predicted evolutionary response, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, to $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{G}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, $\\mathbf{S}$, and $\\mathbf{P}$. The selection differential vector $\\mathbf{S}$ is defined as the change in the mean phenotypic vector within a single generation due to selection. This can be expressed as the covariance between the vector of phenotypic traits, $\\mathbf{z}$, and relative fitness, $w_{rel} = w(\\mathbf{z})/\\bar{w}$, where $w(\\mathbf{z})$ is the absolute fitness of an individual with phenotype $\\mathbf{z}$ and $\\bar{w}$ is the mean fitness of the population.\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{z}, w_{rel})\n$$\nBy definition of covariance, and noting that the mean of relative fitness $\\bar{w}_{rel}$ is $1$, this is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(w_{rel} - \\bar{w}_{rel})] = E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})w_{rel}]\n$$\nThe problem specifies a first-order linear approximation for relative fitness as a function of the deviation of traits from their mean. This is the cornerstone of the Lande-Arnold framework:\n$$\nw_{rel}(\\mathbf{z}) \\approx 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the vector of directional selection gradients, which quantifies the direct force of directional selection on each trait. Substituting this linear approximation into the expression for $\\mathbf{S}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} \\approx E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}))]\n$$\nExpanding the product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} \\approx E[\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}] + E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})^{T}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}]\n$$\nThe first term, $E[\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}]$, equals $\\mathbf{0}$. The second term contains the expectation $E[(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})^{T}]$, which is the definition of the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{P}$. Thus, we arrive at the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{P}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nAssuming the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ is non-singular (invertible), we can solve for the selection gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the selection gradient, which measures direct selection on a trait, can be estimated from the observable selection differential and the phenotypic variances and covariances among traits.\n\nNext, we derive the equation for the one-generation change in the mean trait vector, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$, often called the response to selection. This response depends on the heritable variation subject to selection. The change in the mean breeding value vector, $\\bar{\\mathbf{a}}$, across one generation is the response to selection, $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}$. Using a similar application of the Price equation, the change in the mean breeding value is the covariance between breeding values and relative fitness:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{a}} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, w_{rel})\n$$\nSubstituting the same linear model for relative fitness:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}}_i = \\text{cov}(a_i, 1 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}(\\mathbf{z} - \\bar{\\mathbf{z}})) = \\sum_{j} \\text{cov}(a_i, z_j)\\beta_j\n$$\nIn matrix form, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{z})\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nThe term $\\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{z})$ is the covariance matrix between breeding values and phenotypic values. Under the standard additive model of quantitative genetics, $\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{e}$, where $\\mathbf{a}$ is the vector of breeding values and $\\mathbf{e}$ is the vector of environmental and non-additive genetic deviations, with $\\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{e}) = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{z}) = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{e}) = \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{a}) + \\text{cov}(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{e}) = \\text{var}(\\mathbf{a}) = \\mathbf{G}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{G}$ is the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix. Substituting this into the equation for the response gives the multivariate breeder's equation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n$$\nThis equation predicts the evolutionary change in the mean phenotype of the population. The term \"correlated response\" arises from the off-diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{G}$. Selection on one trait (a non-zero component of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$) can cause a response in another trait if there is a non-zero additive genetic covariance between them.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the provided data.\nGiven:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{S}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 \\\\ 0.1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{G}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, calculate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}$. We need the inverse of $\\mathbf{P}$. The determinant of $\\mathbf{P}$ is $\\det(\\mathbf{P}) = (2)(3) - (1)(1) = 6 - 1 = 5$.\nThe inverse is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 & -0.2 \\\\ -0.2 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6 & -0.2 \\\\ -0.2 & 0.4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 \\\\ 0.1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0.6)(0.4) + (-0.2)(0.1) \\\\ (-0.2)(0.4) + (0.4)(0.1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.24 - 0.02 \\\\ -0.08 + 0.04 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.22 \\\\ -0.04 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the selection gradients are $\\beta_1 = 0.22$ and $\\beta_2 = -0.04$.\n\nNext, we calculate the response to selection $\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{G}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.22 \\\\ -0.04 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1.2)(0.22) + (0.3)(-0.04) \\\\ (0.3)(0.22) + (0.8)(-0.04) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.264 - 0.012 \\\\ 0.066 - 0.032 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.252 \\\\ 0.034 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the predicted response for the two traits are $\\Delta \\bar{z}_1 = 0.252$ and $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2 = 0.034$. The positive value of $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2$ despite negative direct selection ($\\beta_2 < 0$) is an example of a correlated response, driven by the positive genetic covariance ($G_{12} = 0.3$) and strong positive selection on trait $z_1$.\n\nThe required final answer is a single row matrix listing $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_1$, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2$.\nThe values are: $\\beta_1 = 0.22$, $\\beta_2 = -0.04$, $\\Delta \\bar{z}_1 = 0.252$, and $\\Delta \\bar{z}_2 = 0.034$.",
