            "problem": "In a randomly mating diploid population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with two alleles $A$ and $a$ at a single locus, the allele frequency of $A$ is $p$ and of $a$ is $q = 1 - p$. The genotype frequencies are therefore $p^{2}$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^{2}$ for $aa$. Assume no epistasis and that environmental deviations have mean zero and are independent of genotype, so that the observed genotype means equal the true genotypic values. You observe the following genotype-specific phenotypic means for a quantitative trait: $G_{AA} = 10$, $G_{Aa} = 9.5$, and $G_{aa} = 8$. The allele frequency is $p = 0.7$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions (genotype frequencies from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, population expectations, variance and covariance, and the definition of the average effect of allele substitution as the slope of the least-squares regression of genotypic value on allele count), do the following:\n\n1. Define the random variables $X \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ as the number of $A$ alleles carried by an individual genotype and $G$ as the genotypic value.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in quantitative genetics. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and we proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the average effect of allele substitution ($\\alpha$), the additive genetic variance ($V_A$), and the dominance variance ($V_D$) for a single locus with two alleles in a population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters and random variables as specified. The population is diploid and at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. There are two alleles, $A$ and $a$, with frequencies $p$ and $q$ respectively. We are given $p = 0.7$, which implies $q = 1 - p = 0.3$. The genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ have frequencies $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of $A$ alleles in a genotype. $X$ can take values $2$, $1$, or $0$ for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively. The probabilities are:\n$P(X=2) = p^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49$\n$P(X=1) = 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$\n$P(X=0) = q^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 = 1.0$, as required.\n\nLet $G$ be the random variable for the genotypic value. The problem provides the following values for $G$:\n$G_{AA} = 10$ (for $X=2$)\n$G_{Aa} = 9.5$ (for $X=1$)\n$G_{aa} = 8$ (for $X=0$)\n\nTo address the three parts of the problem, we must first compute the necessary population moments for the variables $X$ and $G$.\n\nThe expectation of $X$ is:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i} x_i P(X=x_i) = (2)(p^2) + (1)(2pq) + (0)(q^2) = 2p^2 + 2pq = 2p(p+q) = 2p$$\nNumerically, $E[X] = 2(0.7) = 1.4$.\n\nThe expectation of $X^2$ is:\n$$E[X^2] = \\sum_{i} x_i^2 P(X=x_i) = (2^2)(p^2) + (1^2)(2pq) + (0^2)(q^2) = 4p^2 + 2pq$$\nNumerically, $E[X^2] = 4(0.7)^2 + 2(0.7)(0.3) = 4(0.49) + 0.42 = 1.96 + 0.42 = 2.38$.\n\nThe variance of $X$ is:\n$$\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = (4p^2 + 2pq) - (2p)^2 = 4p^2 + 2pq - 4p^2 = 2pq$$\nNumerically, $\\text{Var}(X) = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$.\n\nThe expectation of $G$, which is the mean genotypic value of the population, is:\n$$\\mu_G = E[G] = G_{AA} p^2 + G_{Aa} 2pq + G_{aa} q^2$$\nNumerically, $E[G] = (10)(0.49) + (9.5)(0.42) + (8)(0.09) = 4.9 + 3.99 + 0.72 = 9.61$.\n\nThe expectation of the product $XG$ is:\n$$E[XG] = (2)(G_{AA})(p^2) + (1)(G_{Aa})(2pq) + (0)(G_{aa})(q^2)$$\nNumerically, $E[XG] = (2)(10)(0.49) + (1)(9.5)(0.42) + (0)(8)(0.09) = 9.8 + 3.99 = 13.79$.\n\nThe covariance of $X$ and $G$ is:\n$$\\text{Cov}(X,G) = E[XG] - E[X]E[G]$$\nNumerically, $\\text{Cov}(X,G) = 13.79 - (1.4)(9.61) = 13.79 - 13.454 = 0.336$.\n\n1. Derive and compute $\\alpha$.\nThe problem defines the average effect of allele substitution, $\\alpha$, as the slope of the least-squares linear regression of genotypic value $G$ on allele count $X$. The regression model is $\\hat{G} = \\beta_0 + \\alpha X$. The principle of least squares minimizes the expected squared error, $S = E[(G - (\\beta_0 + \\alpha X))^2]$. The normal equations are obtained by setting the partial derivatives of $S$ with respect to $\\beta_0$ and $\\alpha$ to zero.\n$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\beta_0} = -2 E[G - \\beta_0 - \\alpha X] = 0 \\implies E[G] = \\beta_0 + \\alpha E[X]$.\n$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\alpha} = -2 E[X(G - \\beta_0 - \\alpha X)] = 0 \\implies E[XG] = \\beta_0 E[X] + \\alpha E[X^2]$.\nSubstituting $\\beta_0 = E[G] - \\alpha E[X]$ into the second equation:\n$E[XG] = (E[G] - \\alpha E[X])E[X] + \\alpha E[X^2]$\n$E[XG] - E[G]E[X] = \\alpha (E[X^2] - (E[X])^2)$\nThis simplifies to $\\text{Cov}(X,G) = \\alpha \\text{Var}(X)$.\nThus, the expression for $\\alpha$ is derived from first principles:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,G)}{\\text{Var}(X)}$$\nUsing our computed numerical values:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{0.336}{0.42} = 0.8$$\n\n2. Derive and compute $V_A$.\nThe problem defines the additive genetic value (breeding value), $A$, as the fitted value from the regression. The set of breeding values $\\{A_i\\}$ for genotypes $\\{i\\}$ are the points on the regression line corresponding to their allele count $x_i$. The regression model can be written as $A = \\hat{G}(X) = \\beta_0 + \\alpha X$.\nThe additive genetic variance, $V_A$, is the variance of these breeding values:\n$$V_A = \\text{Var}(A) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{G}) = \\text{Var}(\\beta_0 + \\alpha X)$$\nSince $\\beta_0$ and $\\alpha$ are constants determined by the population parameters, the variance simplifies:\n$$V_A = \\text{Var}(\\alpha X) = \\alpha^2 \\text{Var}(X)$$\nThis derivation is based directly on the provided definition. Now we compute the value:\n$$V_A = (0.8)^2 \\times (0.42) = 0.64 \\times 0.42 = 0.2688$$\n\n3. Define, derive, and compute $V_D$.\nThe dominance deviation, $D$, is defined as the residual from the regression, i.e., the difference between the actual genotypic value $G$ and the predicted breeding value $A$.\n$$D = G - A = G - \\hat{G}$$\nThe dominance variance, $V_D$, is the variance of the dominance deviations, $V_D = \\text{Var}(D)$.\nThe mean of the dominance deviations is always zero by construction of the least-squares regression:\n$E[D] = E[G - \\hat{G}] = E[G] - E[\\hat{G}] = E[G] - E[\\beta_0 + \\alpha X] = E[G] - (\\beta_0 + \\alpha E[X])$. From the first normal equation, $\\beta_0 + \\alpha E[X] = E[G]$, so $E[D] = 0$.\nTherefore, the variance is simply the expectation of the squared deviations:\n$$V_D = E[D^2] - (E[D])^2 = E[(G - \\hat{G})^2]$$\nWe calculate the specific deviations for each genotype. First we find the intercept $\\beta_0 = E[G] - \\alpha E[X] = 9.61 - (0.8)(1.4) = 9.61 - 1.12 = 8.49$.\nThe regression line is $\\hat{G}(X) = 8.49 + 0.8 X$.\nFor genotype $AA$ ($X=2$):\n$A_{AA} = \\hat{G}(2) = 8.49 + 0.8(2) = 10.09$\n$D_{AA} = G_{AA} - A_{AA} = 10 - 10.09 = -0.09$\nFor genotype $Aa$ ($X=1$):\n$A_{Aa} = \\hat{G}(1) = 8.49 + 0.8(1) = 9.29$\n$D_{Aa} = G_{Aa} - A_{Aa} = 9.5 - 9.29 = 0.21$\nFor genotype $aa$ ($X=0$):\n$A_{aa} = \\hat{G}(0) = 8.49 + 0.8(0) = 8.49$\n$D_{aa} = G_{aa} - A_{aa} = 8 - 8.49 = -0.49$\nThe dominance variance is the weighted average of the squared deviations:\n$$V_D = (D_{AA})^2 p^2 + (D_{Aa})^2 (2pq) + (D_{aa})^2 q^2$$\nNumerically:\n$$V_D = (-0.09)^2 (0.49) + (0.21)^2 (0.42) + (-0.49)^2 (0.09)$$\n$$V_D = (0.0081)(0.49) + (0.0441)(0.42) + (0.2401)(0.09)$$\n$$V_D = 0.003969 + 0.018522 + 0.021609 = 0.0441$$\n\nConclusion on the genetic architecture:\nWe have computed the additive genetic variance $V_A = 0.2688$ and the dominance variance $V_D = 0.0441$. Comparing these magnitudes, it is clear that $V_A > V_D$. The additive variance is approximately $0.2688 / 0.0441 \\approx 6.1$ times larger than the dominance variance.\nTherefore, under the given conditions ($p=0.7$, and the specified genotypic values), the additive component $V_A$ dominates the genetic architecture of this trait. This dominance of $V_A$ arises because the average effect of substituting an allele ($\\alpha=0.8$) contributes more significantly to the total genetic variance than the non-linear deviations from the additive model (dominance effects). The value of $V_A$ is proportional to $\\alpha^2$, while $V_D$ is related to the squared dominance effect. In this case, the larger magnitude of the squared average effect of substitution, scaled by allele frequencies, results in a substantially larger additive variance compared to the dominance variance.\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures gives:\n$\\alpha = 0.8000$\n$V_A = 0.2688$\n$V_D = 0.04410$",

It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumption that phenotypic variance $V_P$ is constant while its component, additive genetic variance $V_A$, changes is a strong simplification. However, it is explicitly stated as a condition for solving this specific problem, a common pedagogical tool to isolate a particular phenomenon. Under this instructional constraint, the problem is internally consistent and solvable. It does not violate any fundamental principles within its own defined framework. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the response to selection for a quantitative trait is the breeder's equation. For each generation $t$, this is given by:\n$$R_t = h_t^2 S_t$$\nwhere $R_t$ is the response to selection, $S_t$ is the selection differential, and $h_t^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability. The narrow-sense heritability is defined as the ratio of additive genetic variance, $V_{A,t}$, to the total phenotypic variance, $V_{P,t}$:\n$$h_t^2 = \\frac{V_{A,t}}{V_{P,t}}$$\nThe problem asks us to determine the trajectory of $h_t^2$, infer the change in $V_{A,t}$, and compute the ratio $V_{A,6}/V_{A,1}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the narrow-sense heritability for each of the $6$ generations using the provided data and rearranging the breeder's equation to $h_t^2 = R_t / S_t$.\n\nFor generation $t=1$:\n$$h_1^2 = \\frac{R_1}{S_1} = \\frac{0.504}{1.2} = 0.42$$\n\nFor generation $t=2$:\n$$h_2^2 = \\frac{R_2}{S_2} = \\frac{0.54}{1.5} = 0.36$$\n\nFor generation $t=3$:\n$$h_3^2 = \\frac{R_3}{S_3} = \\frac{0.462}{1.4} = 0.33$$\n\nFor generation $t=4$:\n$$h_4^2 = \\frac{R_4}{S_4} = \\frac{0.377}{1.3} = 0.29$$\n\nFor generation $t=5$:\n$$h_5^2 = \\frac{R_5}{S_5} = \\frac{0.40}{1.6} = 0.25$$\n\nFor generation $t=6$:\n$$h_6^2 = \\frac{R_6}{S_6} = \\frac{0.33}{1.5} = 0.22$$\n\nThe trajectory of narrow-sense heritability across the $6$ generations is $\\{0.42, 0.36, 0.33, 0.29, 0.25, 0.22\\}$. There is a clear and monotonic decrease in $h_t^2$ over time.\n\nNext, we infer the dynamics of the additive genetic variance $V_A$. The problem states we must treat the phenotypic variance $V_P$ as constant across generations. Let us denote this constant value by $V_{P, \\text{const}}$. The relationship between $V_{A,t}$ and $h_t^2$ is then:\n$$V_{A,t} = h_t^2 \\times V_{P,t} = h_t^2 \\times V_{P, \\text{const}}$$\nThis equation shows that, under the assumption of constant phenotypic variance, the additive genetic variance $V_{A,t}$ is directly proportional to the narrow-sense heritability $h_t^2$. As we have observed a consistent decrease in $h_t^2$ from generation $1$ to generation $6$, we must conclude that the additive genetic variance $V_A$ was depleted by the sustained directional selection. This is the expected outcome, as selection tends to fix alleles that contribute favorably to the trait, thereby reducing the genetic variation for that trait in the population.\n\nFinally, we compute the proportion of additive genetic variance remaining in generation $6$ relative to generation $1$. This is the ratio $V_{A,6}/V_{A,1}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$\\frac{V_{A,6}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{h_6^2 \\times V_{P, \\text{const}}}{h_1^2 \\times V_{P, \\text{const}}}$$\nThe constant term $V_{P, \\text{const}}$ cancels out, leaving the ratio of the heritabilities:\n$$\\frac{V_{A,6}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{h_6^2}{h_1^2}$$\nSubstituting the computed values for $h_1^2$ and $h_6^2$:\n$$\\frac{V_{A,6}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{0.22}{0.42} = \\frac{11}{21}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{11}{21} \\approx 0.52380952...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5238$. This means that approximately $52.38\\%$ of the initial additive genetic variance remains at the end of the selection experiment.",

The general first-order Taylor series approximation for the variance of $g(X, Y)$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(g(X, Y)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial X}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Var}(X) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial Y}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Var}(Y) + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial X}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial Y}\\right) \\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)\n$$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the expected values of $X$ and $Y$, which are estimated by $\\hat{V}_{A}$ and $\\hat{V}_{P}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $g(V_{A}, V_{P})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial V_{A}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{A}} \\left( \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{V_{P}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial V_{P}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{P}} \\left( \\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}} \\right) = -\\frac{V_{A}}{V_{P}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula, with $X = \\hat{V}_{A}$ and $Y = \\hat{V}_{P}$, and evaluating at the point estimates:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{V}_{P}}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{V}_{A}) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hat{V}_{A}}{\\hat{V}_{P}^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{V}_{P}) + 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat{V}_{P}}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{\\hat{V}_{A}}{\\hat{V}_{P}^{2}}\\right) \\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{V}_{A}, \\hat{V}_{P})\n$$\nWe are given standard errors, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\cdot)$, so we use the relation $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = [\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\theta})]^{2}$. The formula becomes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2}) \\approx \\frac{[\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{V}_{A})]^{2}}{\\hat{V}_{P}^{2}} + \\frac{\\hat{V}_{A}^{2} [\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{V}_{P})]^{2}}{\\hat{V}_{P}^{4}} - \\frac{2 \\hat{V}_{A}}{\\hat{V}_{P}^{3}} \\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{V}_{A}, \\hat{V}_{P})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2}) \\approx \\frac{(0.35)^{2}}{(5.2)^{2}} + \\frac{(2.8)^{2} (0.30)^{2}}{(5.2)^{4}} - \\frac{2(2.8)}{(5.2)^{3}}(0.06)\n$$\nLet us calculate each term:\n$$\n\\frac{0.1225}{27.04} \\approx 0.00453033\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{(7.84)(0.09)}{731.1616} = \\frac{0.7056}{731.1616} \\approx 0.00096504\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{5.6}{140.608}(0.06) \\approx (0.039827)(0.06) \\approx 0.00238962\n$$\nCombining these terms:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2}) \\approx 0.00453033 + 0.00096504 - 0.00238962 = 0.00310575\n$$\nThe standard error of the heritability estimate is the square root of its variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{h}^{2}) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00310575} \\approx 0.055729\n$$\nAn approximate two-sided $0.95$ confidence interval for $h^{2}$ is constructed based on the asymptotic normality of $\\hat{h}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\text{CI} = \\hat{h}^{2} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{h}^{2})\n$$\nFor a $0.95$ confidence level, $\\alpha = 0.05$, and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$. The half-width of this confidence interval is given by the term $z_{\\alpha/2} \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{h}^{2})$.\n$$\n\\text{Half-width} = 1.96 \\times \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{h}^{2}) \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.055729 \\approx 0.10922884\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the half-width is $0.1092$.\n\nRegarding the second part of the question, concerning the effect of sample size $N$: under standard asymptotic theory for maximum likelihood estimators, the variances of the estimators are inversely proportional to the sample size, i.e., $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\propto 1/N$. Consequently, the standard errors are inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\propto 1/\\sqrt{N}$. The covariance between estimators also scales with $1/N$, i.e., $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{\\theta}_{1}, \\hat{\\theta}_{2}) \\propto 1/N$.\nFrom our derived formula for $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2})$, each term contains either a variance or a covariance in its numerator. Thus, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{h}^{2})$ as a whole scales with $1/N$. The standard error, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{h}^{2})$, therefore scales with $\\sqrt{1/N} = 1/\\sqrt{N}$. As the confidence interval width is directly proportional to $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{h}^{2})$, we expect the width to decrease in proportion to $1/\\sqrt{N}$ as the sample size $N$ increases substantially. This reflects the increased precision of the heritability estimate obtained from a larger dataset.\n\nThe question asks for the half-width of the confidence interval for $h^{2}$. This is the final value to be reported.",
