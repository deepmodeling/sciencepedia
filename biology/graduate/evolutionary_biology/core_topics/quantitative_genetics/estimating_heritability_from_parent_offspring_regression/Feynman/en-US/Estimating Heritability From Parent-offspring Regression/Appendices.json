            "problem": "A quantitative trait (e.g., a linear morphological measurement) is measured in millimeters in a large, randomly mating population of a wild vertebrate. Assume the following empirically supported conditions: (i) the trait is well described by an additive decomposition of phenotypes into additive genetic and environmental components, (ii) there is no assortative mating, no dominance or epistasis contributing to covariance across generations, and no shared environmental covariance between parents and offspring, and (iii) the phenotypic variance is equal across the parental and offspring generations. For each of $n=7$ independent full-sib families, you have the sire and dam phenotypes and a single offspring phenotype measured at adulthood in a common garden, listed here in millimeters:\n- Family $1$: sire $9$, dam $11$, offspring $7$\n- Family $2$: sire $10$, dam $14$, offspring $8$\n- Family $3$: sire $12$, dam $16$, offspring $9$\n- Family $4$: sire $14$, dam $18$, offspring $10$\n- Family $5$: sire $16$, dam $20$, offspring $11$\n- Family $6$: sire $18$, dam $22$, offspring $12$\n- Family $7$: sire $20$, dam $24$, offspring $13$\n\nTasks:\n1) For each family, compute the midparent value $M_i = (P_{i,\\mathrm{si}} + P_{i,\\mathrm{da}})/2$, where $P_{i,\\mathrm{si}}$ and $P_{i,\\mathrm{da}}$ are the sire and dam phenotypes of family $i$.\n2) Using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, fit a linear model of the form $Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta M_i + \\varepsilon_i$, where $Y_i$ is the offspring phenotype of family $i$, to obtain estimates $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n3) Starting from fundamental definitions in quantitative genetics, including the decomposition $P = A + E$ with additive genetic variance $V_A$ and phenotypic variance $V_P$, and the fact that the expected offspring additive value equals the average of parental additive values under random mating and additivity, derive why, under the stated conditions, the OLS slope $\\hat{\\beta}$ provides an estimate of the narrow-sense heritability $h^2 = V_A/V_P$.\n4) Report your numerical estimate of $h^2$ based on the fitted regression.

            "solution": "We begin from first principles of quantitative genetics. Each phenotype is written as $P = A + E$, where $A$ is the additive genetic (breeding) value and $E$ is the environmental deviation. The narrow-sense heritability is $h^2 = V_A / V_P$, where $V_A$ is the additive genetic variance and $V_P$ is the phenotypic variance. Under random mating and purely additive gene action, the expected additive value of an offspring equals the average of its parents’ additive values. Environmental deviations of offspring are independent of parental phenotypes, and there is no assortative mating, so parental phenotypes are uncorrelated across mates. Under these conditions and equal phenotypic variance across generations, the regression of offspring phenotype on midparent phenotype has slope equal to $h^2$.\n\nData processing:\n1) Compute midparent values $M_i = (P_{i,\\mathrm{si}} + P_{i,\\mathrm{da}})/2$ for each family:\n- Family $1$: $M_1 = (9 + 11)/2 = 10$\n- Family $2$: $M_2 = (10 + 14)/2 = 12$\n- Family $3$: $M_3 = (12 + 16)/2 = 14$\n- Family $4$: $M_4 = (14 + 18)/2 = 16$\n- Family $5$: $M_5 = (16 + 20)/2 = 18$\n- Family $6$: $M_6 = (18 + 22)/2 = 20$\n- Family $7$: $M_7 = (20 + 24)/2 = 22$\n\nThus, the data pairs $(M_i, Y_i)$ are:\n$(10, 7)$, $(12, 8)$, $(14, 9)$, $(16, 10)$, $(18, 11)$, $(20, 12)$, $(22, 13)$.\n\n2) Fit the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression $Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta M_i + \\varepsilon_i$. The OLS slope is $\\hat{\\beta} = S_{XY} / S_{XX}$, where\n$$\n\\bar{M} = \\frac{1}{7}\\sum_{i=1}^{7} M_i, \\quad \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{7}\\sum_{i=1}^{7} Y_i,\n$$\n$$\nS_{XX} = \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (M_i - \\bar{M})^2, \\quad S_{XY} = \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (M_i - \\bar{M})(Y_i - \\bar{Y}).\n$$\nCompute the means:\n$$\n\\bar{M} = \\frac{10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 22}{7} = \\frac{112}{7} = 16,\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{Y} = \\frac{7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13}{7} = \\frac{70}{7} = 10.\n$$\nCompute deviations and cross-products:\n- For $M_i - \\bar{M}$ we have $-6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6$.\n- For $Y_i - \\bar{Y}$ we have $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nThus,\n$$\nS_{XX} = 36 + 16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16 + 36 = 112,\n$$\n$$\nS_{XY} = (-6)(-3) + (-4)(-2) + (-2)(-1) + 0\\cdot 0 + 2\\cdot 1 + 4\\cdot 2 + 6\\cdot 3 = 18 + 8 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 8 + 18 = 56.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{S_{XY}}{S_{XX}} = \\frac{56}{112} = 0.5.\n$$\nThe intercept is\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} = \\bar{Y} - \\hat{\\beta}\\,\\bar{M} = 10 - 0.5 \\times 16 = 10 - 8 = 2.\n$$\n\n3) Derivation that the slope equals $h^2$ from first principles:\nWrite parental phenotypes as $P_f = A_f + E_f$ and $P_m = A_m + E_m$, and the offspring phenotype as $P_o = A_o + E_o$.

Using $\\operatorname{Cov}(A_o, P_f) = \\operatorname{Cov}(A_o, A_f) = \\frac{1}{2} V_A$ and similarly for the dam,\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(P_o, M) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}V_A + \\tfrac{1}{2}V_A\\right) = \\tfrac{1}{2} V_A.\n$$\nCompute $\\operatorname{Var}(M)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(M) = \\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}(P_f + P_m)\\right) = \\tfrac{1}{4}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}(P_f) + \\operatorname{Var}(P_m) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(P_f, P_m)\\right] = \\tfrac{1}{4}(V_P + V_P + 0) = \\tfrac{1}{2} V_P.\n$$\nTherefore, the population regression slope of offspring phenotype on midparent phenotype is\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(P_o, M)}{\\operatorname{Var}(M)} = \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{2} V_A}{\\tfrac{1}{2} V_P} = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} = h^2.\n$$\nUnder the stated conditions (including equal phenotypic variance across generations and no biases from shared environments or assortative mating), the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$ is a consistent estimator of $h^2$.\n\n4) Numerical estimate of $h^2$:\nFrom step $2$, $\\hat{\\beta} = 0.5$. Rounding to three significant figures and expressing as a decimal yields $0.500$.\n\nInterpretation of the intercept $\\hat{\\alpha}$:\nThe intercept is $\\hat{\\alpha} = 2$. In a regression of $Y$ on $M$, the intercept equals $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\bar{Y} - \\hat{\\beta}\\,\\bar{M}$. Given equal phenotypic variance across generations and the additive model, a nonzero intercept indicates a generation-wide shift in the offspring mean that is independent of midparent value, consistent with a common environmental effect experienced by the offspring generation (e.g., improved nutrition or climate) that adds approximately $2$ millimeters to the trait relative to what would be predicted from parental phenotypes alone. Under a strictly stationary environment and no mean shift, we would expect $\\hat{\\alpha}$ to be close to $0$.",

Therefore\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X^{\\ast}) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(\\frac{T_{m}+T_{f}}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\operatorname{Var}(T_{m}) + \\operatorname{Var}(T_{f})\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}(2 \\sigma_{T}^{2}) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{T}^{2}}{2},\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\delta) \\;=\\; \\operatorname{Var}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{m}+\\epsilon_{f}}{2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_{m}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_{f})\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{4}(2 \\sigma_{e}^{2}) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{e}^{2}}{2}.\n$$\nHence the reliability of the observed mid-parent constructed from single replicates is\n$$\nr_{XX} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(X^{\\ast})}{\\operatorname{Var}(X^{\\ast}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\delta)}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{T}^{2}/2}{\\sigma_{T}^{2}/2 + \\sigma_{e}^{2}/2}\n\\;=\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{T}^{2}}{\\sigma_{T}^{2} + \\sigma_{e}^{2}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the estimates,\n$$\n\\hat{r}_{XX} \\;=\\; \\frac{1.44}{1.44 + 1.44} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\;=\\; 0.5.\n$$\n\nThe observed OLS slope is $b_{\\text{obs}} = 0.27$. Therefore the attenuation-corrected estimate of $h^{2}$ is\n$$\n\\widehat{h^{2}} \\;=\\; \\frac{b_{\\text{obs}}}{\\hat{r}_{XX}} \\;=\\; \\frac{0.27}{0.5} \\;=\\; 0.54.\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5400$.",
