In the positive-ion mode, the most common ions formed are the protonated molecule $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$, adducts with ambient cations like sodium ($[\\text{M}+\\text{Na}]^+$), and, at sufficient analyte concentration, gas-phase aggregates like the protonated dimer $[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\n\nWe will evaluate each of the given options to see which one provides a consistent and plausible explanation for all three peaks. We will use the provided monoisotopic masses: $m_H = 1.0078$ u and $m_{Na} = 22.9898$ u. The observed m/z values are for singly charged ions, so m/z is numerically equal to the mass of the ion in u.\n\nLet's evaluate Option A.\nThis option proposes $M \\approx 252.1$ u. Let's start by assuming the peak at m/z 253.1 is the protonated molecule, $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\nFrom $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+ = 253.1$, we can calculate the mass of the neutral molecule M:\n$M = 253.1 - m_H = 253.1 - 1.0078 = 252.0922$ u.\nThis is consistent with the proposed mass of approximately 252.1 u.\nNow, let's use this mass to check if it can form the other observed ions.\nThe second proposed ion is the sodiated adduct, $[\\text{M}+\\text{Na}]^+$. Its predicted mass would be:\n$[\\text{M}+\\text{Na}]^+ = M + m_{Na} = 252.0922 + 22.9898 = 275.0820$ u.\nThis value, when rounded to one decimal place, is 275.1, which matches the second observed peak perfectly.\nThe third proposed ion is the protonated dimer, $[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$. Its predicted mass would be:\n$[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+ = 2 \\times M + m_H = 2 \\times 252.0922 + 1.0078 = 504.1844 + 1.0078 = 505.1922$ u.\nThis value, when rounded to one decimal place, is 505.2, which matches the third observed peak perfectly.\nAll three peaks are explained consistently by a single neutral mass M and the most common DART ionization pathways. Therefore, Option A is a very strong candidate.\n\nLet's evaluate Option B.\nThis option proposes $M \\approx 504.2$ u, suggesting the largest peak is the protonated molecule $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\nFrom $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+ = 505.2$, we calculate the mass of the neutral molecule M:\n$M = 505.2 - m_H = 505.2 - 1.0078 = 504.1922$ u.\nThis is consistent with the proposed mass of approximately 504.2 u.\nThis option suggests the other two peaks arise from a fragment of mass $M/2$. Let's calculate the mass of this hypothetical fragment:\n$M/2 = 504.1922 / 2 = 252.0961$ u.\nNow let's check the predicted masses for the fragment ions.\nProtonated fragment $[(\\text{M}/2)+\\text{H}]^+$: $252.0961 + 1.0078 = 253.1039$ u. This rounds to 253.1, matching the first peak.\nSodiated fragment $[(\\text{M}/2)+\\text{Na}]^+$: $252.0961 + 22.9898 = 275.0859$ u. This rounds to 275.1, matching the second peak.\nArithmetically, this option is also perfectly consistent with the observed data. However, we must consider chemical plausibility. DART is a soft ionization technique that favors aggregation (dimer formation) and adduction over fragmentation. The scenario in Option B requires the parent molecule to both ionize gently to form $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$ and undergo a high-energy fragmentation process to yield a perfectly halved fragment (M/2), which then also ionizes. It is chemically much less likely to observe these opposing processes (aggregation/soft ionization vs. fragmentation) as the dominant pathways in a single DART spectrum of a purified compound compared to the simple adduction and dimerization pathways proposed in Option A. The formation of a dimer is a very common observation in DART. Thus, Option A is chemically more plausible.\n\nLet's evaluate Option C.\nThis option proposes $M \\approx 274.1$ u, assuming the peak at m/z 275.1 is $[\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\n$M = 275.1 - m_H = 275.1 - 1.0078 = 274.0922$ u.\nThe option then proposes the peak at 253.1 is a fragment, $[\\text{M}-\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2+\\text{H}]^+$. Mass of $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2$ is approx 26 u. $M - 26 + 1 = 274.1-26+1 = 249.1$ u, which does not match 253.1.\nThe option proposes the peak at 505.2 is the protonated dimer, $[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\n$[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+ = 2 \\times 274.0922 + 1.0078 = 548.1844 + 1.0078 = 549.1922$ u. This is very different from the observed 505.2.\nOption C is mathematically inconsistent.\n\nLet's evaluate Option D.\nThis option proposes $M \\approx 253.1$ u, assuming the peak at m/z 253.1 is the radical cation $[\\text{M}]^{+\\cdot}$.\nThen $M = 253.1$ u.\nIt proposes the peak at 275.1 is a sodiated fragment $[\\text{M}-\\text{H}_2+\\text{Na}]^+$.\n$[\\text{M}-\\text{H}_2+\\text{Na}]^+ = 253.1 - 2 \\times 1.0078 + 22.9898 = 253.1 - 2.0156 + 22.9898 = 274.0742$ u. This does not match 275.1.\nIt also proposes the peak at 505.2 is the protonated dimer, $[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+$.\n$[2\\text{M}+\\text{H}]^+ = 2 \\times 253.1 + 1.0078 = 506.2 + 1.0078 = 507.2078$ u. This does not match 505.2.\nOption D is mathematically inconsistent.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option A provides a fully consistent and chemically plausible explanation for all the data.
