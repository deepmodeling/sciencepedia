A kineticist reports a macroscopic rate law of the form $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ over a certain concentration range at fixed temperature and pressure. Using only first principles appropriate to elementary chemical kinetics (namely, that the rate of an elementary molecular encounter is proportional to the product of the activities of the reacting molecules present in that encounter, and that the count of distinct molecules participating in a single encounter is an integer), select the option that correctly and completely:\n- defines an elementary step and molecularity;\n- contrasts molecularity with overall reaction order; and\n- explains whether the observed rate law $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ could arise from a single elementary step corresponding to $2A \\to P$.\n\nOptions:\nA. An elementary step is a single, indivisible molecular event with no intermediates; its molecularity is the count of reactant molecules in that event and is necessarily an integer. For an elementary step $2A \\to P$, the elementary rate law is $r = k\\,a_A^2$, where $a_A$ is the activity of $A$, which reduces to $r = k[A]^2$ under ideal conditions. Overall reaction order is the sum of exponents in an experimentally determined macroscopic rate law and may be non-integer or condition-dependent for complex mechanisms. Therefore, a macroscopic rate law $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ cannot arise from the single elementary step $2A \\to P$ under ideal conditions; such fractional apparent order reflects either a multistep mechanism or concentration-dependent activity coefficients when one writes rates in terms of $[A]$ instead of $a_A$.\n\nB. Molecularity is identical to overall reaction order and can be fractional; hence the observed $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ is consistent with $2A \\to P$ being a single elementary step, especially under non-ideal conditions.\n\nC. The rate law $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ proves that the reaction is a termolecular elementary process in which, on average, $1.5$ molecules of $A$ collide to form $P$; molecularity and overall order are equivalent and can be non-integer.\n\nD. An elementary step’s order can be any real number if the transition state has fractional stoichiometry; therefore, the elementary step $2A \\to P$ can legitimately have $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ as its elementary rate law even in an ideal gas.\n\nE. Because unimolecular decompositions show non-integer orders in the Lindemann picture at low pressure, by analogy any bimolecular elementary step can exhibit fractional order at low concentration; therefore, $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ can arise from the elementary step $2A \\to P$ without invoking intermediates.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of a given gas-phase reaction, $2A \\to P$, which exhibits an experimental rate law $r = k[A]^{1.5}$. The analysis must be based on the first principles of elementary chemical kinetics. Specifically, it must define an elementary step and molecularity, contrast molecularity with reaction order, and determine if the observed rate law is consistent with the reaction being a single elementary step.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement. The provided information includes the net stoichiometry, the form of the macroscopic rate law, and the fundamental principles to be used. The concepts are central to chemical kinetics: elementary steps, molecularity, rate laws, and reaction order. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. There are no contradictions, and the scenario is physically realistic as many complex reactions exhibit fractional-order kinetics. The problem is valid.\n\nNow, we proceed with the solution derivation based on the requested points.\n\n1.  **Definition of Elementary Step and Molecularity**\n    An **elementary step** is a chemical reaction at its most fundamental level, representing a single, indivisible molecular event such as a collision,\n    decomposition, or isomerization. By definition, an elementary step proceeds without any chemical intermediates.\n    **Molecularity** is a theoretical concept that applies exclusively to elementary steps. It is the number of reactant chemical species (molecules, atoms, or ions) that are involved in the single molecular event of the elementary step. Since molecules are discrete entities, molecularity must be an integer. A molecularity of $1$ corresponds to a unimolecular step, $2$ to a bimolecular step, and $3$ to a termolecular step. Molecularities greater than $3$ are exceedingly rare due to the extremely low probability of a simultaneous collision of four or more particles.\n\n2.  **Contrast Between Molecularity and Overall Reaction Order**\n    **Molecularity** is a theoretical, integer value determined by the mechanism of a single elementary step. For an elementary step, the rate law can be written directly from its stoichiometry. For an elementary step $aA + bB \\to \\text{products}$, the rate is given by the law of mass action as $r = k' a_A^a a_B^b$, where $a_A$ and $a_B$ are the activities of species $A$ and $B$, respectively. The molecularity is $a+b$.\n    **Reaction order**, on the other hand, is an empirical quantity derived from experimental data. It refers to the exponents in the macroscopic rate law, $r = k[A]^\\alpha[B]^\\beta...$. The value $\\alpha$ is the order with respect to reactant $A$, $\\beta$ is the order with respect to $B$, and the sum $\\alpha + \\beta + ...$ is the overall reaction order.\n    The key distinction is that while molecularity must be a small positive integer, reaction order can be an integer, a fraction, or zero. For a single elementary step under ideal conditions (where activity is proportional to concentration), the reaction orders with respect to each reactant are identical to their stoichiometric coefficients, and the overall order is equal to the molecularity. However, most chemical reactions are **complex reactions**, meaning they consist of a sequence of multiple elementary steps. For such reactions, the macroscopic rate law is a combination of the rate constants of the individual steps, and the experimentally determined orders ($\\alpha, \\beta, ...$) are generally not equal to the stoichiometric coefficients of the overall balanced equation.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Specific Case: $2A \\to P$ with $r = k[A]^{1.5}$**\n    The problem asks whether the macroscopic rate law $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ could arise from the single elementary step $2A \\to P$.\n    If we hypothesize that the overall reaction $2A \\to P$ is a single elementary step, it would be a **bimolecular** process, as it involves the collision of two molecules of $A$. The molecularity would be $2$.\n    According to the law of mass action for an elementary step, the rate must be proportional to the product of the activities of the reacting species. For the step $2A \\to \\text{products}$, the rate would be given by:\n    $$r = k' a_A^2$$\n    where $a_A$ is the activity of species $A$ and $k'$ is the elementary rate constant.\n    In many cases, particularly for ideal gases or dilute solutions, the activity of a species is assumed to be proportional to its molar concentration, $[A]$. Under these ideal conditions, the rate law for the elementary step $2A \\to P$ would be:\n    $$r = k[A]^2$$\n    This theoretical rate law has a reaction order of $2$ with respect to species $A$.\n    The experimental (macroscopic) rate law is given as $r = k_{obs}[A]^{1.5}$, which shows an overall reaction order of $1.5$.\n    Comparing the theoretical order for the elementary step ($2$) with the experimental order ($1.5$), we find a clear discrepancy. The numerical value $1.5$ is not equal to $2$.\n    Therefore, the reaction $2A \\to P$ cannot proceed via a single elementary step under ideal conditions. The observed fractional order is a strong indicator that the reaction follows a complex, multi-step mechanism. For example, a chain reaction mechanism involving free radicals or a mechanism with a pre-equilibrium step can lead to such a rate law. A second possibility is that the system is highly non-ideal, and the activity coefficient of $A$ has a strong concentration dependence, such that $a_A^2 \\propto [A]^{1.5}$ over the measured concentration range. However, a multi-step mechanism is the more common explanation for fractional orders.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.** This option correctly defines an elementary step and molecularity as an integer count of reacting molecules. It correctly states that for an elementary step $2A \\to P$, the elementary rate law is $r = k\\,a_A^2$, which becomes $r = k[A]^2$ under ideal conditions. It correctly distinguishes this from the overall reaction order, which is empirical and can be non-integer. It correctly concludes that the observed $r = k[A]^{1.5}$ cannot arise from this single elementary step under ideal conditions and correctly proposes the standard explanations for such an observation (multistep mechanism or non-ideality). This option is fully consistent with the principles of chemical kinetics. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option incorrectly states that molecularity is identical to overall reaction order and that molecularity can be fractional. Molecularity is a theoretical, integer concept for elementary steps, while order is empirical. The premise is fundamentally wrong. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from it is also invalid. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option makes the physically nonsensical claim that an average of $1.5$ molecules collide. Molecular collisions involve integer numbers of molecules. The idea of fractional molecularity is a violation of first principles. It also incorrectly equates molecularity and overall order. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option introduces the fallacious idea of \"fractional stoichiometry\" for a transition state to justify a fractional order for an elementary step. In transition state theory, the activated complex is formed from an integer number of reactant molecules. The rate of an elementary step is proportional to the concentration of the activated complex, which in turn is related to the concentrations of the reactants raised to integer powers corresponding to the molecularity. An elementary step cannot have a non-integer order, even with advanced theories. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** This option makes a faulty analogy. The Lindemann mechanism explains the pressure dependence of a *unimolecular* reaction's rate by postulating a *two-step mechanism* involving an energized intermediate ($A^*$). It is precisely because the unimolecular reaction is *not* a single elementary step that its apparent order can change from $2$ to $1$ and be fractional in between. To use this multi-step model to argue that a true *bimolecular elementary step* can have a fractional order is a logical contradiction. The Lindemann mechanism itself relies on invoking an intermediate, which the option's conclusion claims to avoid. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, option A is the only one that is scientifically sound and complete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2954088"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, different proposed mechanisms can lead to the exact same experimentally observed rate law, creating a puzzle for chemists.
