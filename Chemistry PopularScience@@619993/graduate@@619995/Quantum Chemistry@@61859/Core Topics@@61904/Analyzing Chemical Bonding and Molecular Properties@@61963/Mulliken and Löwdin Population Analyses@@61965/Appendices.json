Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to derive and calculate the Mulliken gross atomic populations and net atomic charges for a given molecular system.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the Mulliken gross atomic population. The total number of electrons, $N_e$, in a molecular system described by a set of real, non-orthogonal atomic orbitals $\\{\\chi_\\mu\\}$ is given by the spatial integral of the electron probability density, $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. The density itself is constructed from the one-particle density matrix (1PDM), $D$, and the basis functions:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} D_{\\mu\\nu} \\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r}) \\chi_\\nu(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nThe total number of electrons is therefore:\n$$ N_e = \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} D_{\\mu\\nu} \\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r}) \\chi_\\nu(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = \\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} D_{\\mu\\nu} \\int \\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r}) \\chi_\\nu(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} $$\nThe integral term is the definition of the overlap matrix element, $S_{\\mu\\nu} = \\int \\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r}) \\chi_\\nu(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$. This leads to the fundamental expression for the total number of electrons:\n$$ N_e = \\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} D_{\\mu\\nu} S_{\\mu\\nu} $$\nMulliken population analysis provides a method to partition this total electron count among the individual atoms. The sum is composed of diagonal terms ($\\mu = \\nu$) and off-diagonal terms ($\\mu \\neq \\nu$). A diagonal term, $D_{\\mu\\mu}S_{\\mu\\mu}$, represents a population associated purely with orbital $\\chi_\\mu$. An off-diagonal term, $D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu}$, is an overlap population between orbitals $\\chi_\\mu$ and $\\chi_\\nu$. The Mulliken scheme partitions the total overlap population between a pair of orbitals, $(D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu} + D_{\\nu\\mu}S_{\\nu\\mu})$, equally between the two participating orbitals.\n\nThe gross population of an individual atomic orbital $\\mu$, denoted $N_\\mu$, is defined as its diagonal population plus one-half of all its associated overlap populations:\n$$ N_\\mu = D_{\\mu\\mu}S_{\\mu\\mu} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu} (D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu} + D_{\\nu\\mu}S_{\\nu\\mu}) $$\nFor the given system with real basis functions, the density matrix $D$ and the overlap matrix $S$ are symmetric, i.e., $D_{\\mu\\nu} = D_{\\nu\\mu}$ and $S_{\\mu\\nu} = S_{\\nu\\mu}$. The expression for $N_\\mu$ simplifies considerably:\n$$ N_\\mu = D_{\\mu\\mu}S_{\\mu\\mu} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu} (2 D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu}) = D_{\\mu\\mu}S_{\\mu\\mu} + \\sum_{\\nu \\neq \\mu} D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu} $$\nThis can be written compactly as a single summation over all orbitals $\\nu$:\n$$ N_\\mu = \\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n} D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu} $$\nwhere $n=3$ is the total number of basis functions. Because the overlap matrix $S$ is symmetric ($S_{\\mu\\nu} = S_{\\nu\\mu}$), this is equivalent to:\n$$ N_\\mu = \\sum_{\\nu=1}^{n} D_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\nu\\mu} $$\nThis final expression is precisely the definition of the diagonal element $(\\mu, \\mu)$ of the matrix product $DS$. Thus, the gross population for orbital $\\mu$ is elegantly expressed as:\n$$ N_\\mu = (DS)_{\\mu\\mu} $$\nThe Mulliken gross atomic population of an atom $A$, denoted $G_A$, is the sum of the gross orbital populations for all basis functions $\\{\\chi_\\mu\\}$ centered on that atom:\n$$ G_A = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} N_\\mu = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} (DS)_{\\mu\\mu} $$\nSimilarly, for atom $B$:\n$$ G_B = \\sum_{\\mu \\in B} (DS)_{\\mu\\mu} $$\nThe Mulliken net atomic charge on an atom, $q_A$, is the difference between its nuclear charge, $Z_A$, and its gross atomic population, $G_A$:\n$$ q_A = Z_A - G_A $$\n\nNow, we apply these derived formulae to the given problem.\nThe density matrix $D$ and overlap matrix $S$ are:\n$$ D = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.8 & 0.3 & 0 \\\\ 0.3 & 1.2 & 0.1 \\\\ 0 & 0.1 & 0.0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.2 & 0 \\\\ 0.2 & 1 & 0.1 \\\\ 0 & 0.1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe first compute the matrix product $DS$:\n$$ DS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.8 & 0.3 & 0 \\\\ 0.3 & 1.2 & 0.1 \\\\ 0 & 0.1 & 0.0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.2 & 0 \\\\ 0.2 & 1 & 0.1 \\\\ 0 & 0.1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ DS = \\begin{pmatrix} (1.8)(1)+(0.3)(0.2)+(0)(0) & (1.8)(0.2)+(0.3)(1)+(0)(0.1) & (1.8)(0)+(0.3)(0.1)+(0)(1) \\\\ (0.3)(1)+(1.2)(0.2)+(0.1)(0) & (0.3)(0.2)+(1.2)(1)+(0.1)(0.1) & (0.3)(0)+(1.2)(0.1)+(0.1)(1) \\\\ (0)(1)+(0.1)(0.2)+(0.0)(0) & (0)(0.2)+(0.1)(1)+(0.0)(0.1) & (0)(0)+(0.1)(0.1)+(0.0)(1) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ DS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.8+0.06 & 0.36+0.3 & 0.03 \\\\ 0.3+0.24 & 0.06+1.2+0.01 & 0.12+0.1 \\\\ 0.02 & 0.1 & 0.01 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.86 & 0.66 & 0.03 \\\\ 0.54 & 1.27 & 0.22 \\\\ 0.02 & 0.1 & 0.01 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe basis functions $\\{1, 2\\}$ belong to atom $A$, and basis function $\\{3\\}$ belongs to atom $B$.

The central tenet of this method is the equal partitioning of the \"overlap population\" density, which arises from the product of basis functions centered on different atoms. In our case, the total population of $1$ is composed of three terms: $c_{A}^{2}$ (from the $\\chi_{A}^{2}$ density term), $c_{B}^{2}$ (from $\\chi_{B}^{2}$), and $2 c_{A} c_{B} s$ (from the overlap density $2 c_{A} c_{B} \\chi_{A} \\chi_{B}$).\nAccording to the Mulliken scheme:\n- The \"on-site\" or \"net\" population term $c_{A}^{2}$ is assigned entirely to atom $A$.\n- The overlap population term $2 c_{A} c_{B} s$ is divided equally between atoms $A$ and $B$. Thus, atom $A$ receives a contribution of $c_{A} c_{B} s$ from this term.\n\nThe Mulliken gross atomic population on atom $A$, denoted $G_{A}^{(i)}$, is the sum of its net population and its share of the overlap population:\n$$\nG_{A}^{(i)} = c_{A}^{2} + c_{A} c_{B} s\n$$\nTo calculate this value, we must first find the normalized MO coefficients. The problem states the coefficient vector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let this unnormalized vector be $\\mathbf{c}' = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The normalized vector is $\\mathbf{c} = N \\mathbf{c}'$, where $N$ is a normalization constant determined by the condition $N^{2} (\\mathbf{c}')^{\\top} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}' = 1$.

The unphysical outcome arises directly from the arbitrary nature of the Mulliken partitioning scheme when applied to systems with large basis set overlap (here, $s=0.80$ is very large). The MO has coefficients of opposite sign ($c_{A} > 0$, $c_{B} < 0$), which signifies an antibonding character. This leads to a substantial negative overlap population ($2 c_{A} c_{B} s < 0$). For atom $A$, its assigned share of this negative overlap population ($c_{A} c_{B} s$) is a large negative number that overwhelms its positive net atomic population ($c_{A}^{2}$). This pathological behavior illustrates a well-documented failure of Mulliken analysis, rendering its results unreliable for quantitative interpretation in such cases.\n\nA symmetric orthogonalization procedure, such as that developed by Löwdin, would correct this specific deficiency. Löwdin analysis first transforms the non-orthogonal AO basis $\\{\\chi_{\\mu}\\}$ into a new, orthogonal basis of Löwdin orbitals $\\{\\phi_{\\mu}\\}$ via the transformation $\\mathbf{\\phi} = \\mathbf{\\chi} \\mathbf{S}^{-1/2}$. When the MO $\\psi_{i}$ is rewritten in this orthogonal basis as $\\psi_{i} = \\sum_{\\mu} c'_{\\mu i} \\phi_{\\mu}$, the normalization condition becomes a simple sum of squares, $\\sum_{\\mu} |c'_{\\mu i}|^2 = 1$. The Löwdin population associated with the orthogonalized atomic orbital $\\phi_{A}$ is then $|c'_{A i}|^2$. By definition, this quantity is always non-negative. Therefore, Löwdin populations are always positive and provide a more physically sensible, albeit still basis-set-dependent, partitioning of electronic charge, avoiding the unphysical negative values produced by the Mulliken method in this case.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.2692}\n$$", "id": "2906528"}, {"introduction": "The results of a quantum chemical calculation are intricately tied to the choice of basis set, and Mulliken charges are particularly sensitive to this choice.

The overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}$ and the unnormalized MO coefficient vector $\\mathbf{v}$ are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0.20 & 0.25 & 0.05 \\\\\n0.20 & 1 & 0.05 & 0.15 \\\\\n0.25 & 0.05 & 1 & 0.20 \\\\\n0.05 & 0.15 & 0.20 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.20 \\\\ 0.10 \\\\ 0.60 \\\\ 0.60 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we must normalize the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ to obtain $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{dz}} = \\mathbf{v} / (\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v})^{1/2}$. We compute the normalization factor squared:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.20 & 0.10 & 0.60 & 0.60 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0.20 & 0.25 & 0.05 \\\\\n0.20 & 1 & 0.05 & 0.15 \\\\\n0.25 & 0.05 & 1 & 0.20 \\\\\n0.05 & 0.15 & 0.20 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.20 \\\\ 0.10 \\\\ 0.60 \\\\ 0.60 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe product $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1(0.20) + 0.20(0.10) + 0.25(0.60) + 0.05(0.60) \\\\\n0.20(0.20) + 1(0.10) + 0.05(0.60) + 0.15(0.60) \\\\\n0.25(0.20) + 0.05(0.10) + 1(0.60) + 0.20(0.60) \\\\\n0.05(0.20) + 0.15(0.10) + 0.20(0.60) + 1(0.60)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.20 + 0.02 + 0.15 + 0.03 \\\\\n0.04 + 0.10 + 0.03 + 0.09 \\\\\n0.05 + 0.005 + 0.60 + 0.12 \\\\\n0.01 + 0.015 + 0.12 + 0.60\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.40 \\\\ 0.26 \\\\ 0.775 \\\\ 0.745 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}}(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v})$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v} = 0.20(0.40) + 0.10(0.26) + 0.60(0.775) + 0.60(0.745) = 0.08 + 0.026 + 0.465 + 0.447 = 1.018\n$$\nThe normalized coefficient vector is $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{dz}} = (1.018)^{-1/2}\\mathbf{v}$.\nThe density matrix is $\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{dz}} = 2\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{dz}}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\frac{2}{1.018}\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\nThe Mulliken gross population for an AO $\\mu$ is $(\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}})_{\\mu\\mu}$. We can write this as:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}})_{\\mu\\mu} = \\sum_{\\nu} (D_{\\mathrm{dz}})_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\nu\\mu} = \\sum_{\\nu} \\left(\\frac{2}{1.018}v_{\\mu}v_{\\nu}\\right) S_{\\nu\\mu} = \\frac{2 v_{\\mu}}{1.018} \\sum_{\\nu} S_{\\mu\\nu}v_{\\nu} = \\frac{2 v_{\\mu}}{1.018} (\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v})_{\\mu}\n$$\nThe AOs for atom $A$ are $\\chi_{A1}$ (index $1$) and $\\chi_{A2}$ (index $2$). The gross population on atom $A$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GP}_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{double}\\text{-}\\zeta) = (\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}})_{11} + (\\mathbf{D}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}})_{22}\n$$\nUsing our intermediate results:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GP}_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{double}\\text{-}\\zeta) = \\frac{2 v_1}{1.018}(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v})_1 + \\frac{2 v_2}{1.018}(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathrm{dz}}\\mathbf{v})_2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{GP}_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{double}\\text{-}\\zeta) = \\frac{2(0.20)}{1.018}(0.40) + \\frac{2(0.10)}{1.018}(0.26) = \\frac{0.16 + 0.052}{1.018} = \\frac{0.212}{1.018}\n$$\nNumerically, this population is $\\frac{0.212}{1.018} \\approx 0.20825$.\nThe Mulliken charge on atom $A$ in the double-$\\zeta$ basis is:\n$$\nq_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{double}\\text{-}\\zeta) = Z_A - \\mathrm{GP}_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{double}\\text{-}\\zeta) = 1 - \\frac{0.212}{1.018} = \\frac{1.018 - 0.212}{1.018} = \\frac{0.806}{1.018} \\approx 0.79175\n$$\nIn this double-$\\zeta$ basis, atom $A$ has a charge of approximately $+0.79$.\n\nThe charge polarity on atom $A$ has inverted from $q_A^{\\mathrm{M}} = -1$ in the minimal basis to $q_A^{\\mathrm{M}} \\approx +0.79$ in the double-$\\zeta$ basis. This is a direct consequence of the change in the description of the occupied MO. The minimal basis MO, $\\mathbf{c}_{\\min} = (1, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$, arbitrarily confines the entire electron density to atom $A$. The more flexible double-$\\zeta$ basis allows the MO coefficients to distribute across all four AOs. The given MO, with dominant coefficients on the B-centered AOs ($v_3=0.60, v_4=0.60$) compared to the A-centered AOs ($v_1=0.20, v_2=0.10$), describes a state where electron density is polarized towards atom $B$. The Mulliken analysis reflects this physical picture, resulting in a large positive charge on atom $A$.\n\nFinally, we compute the requested difference $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = q_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{minimal}) - q_A^{\\mathrm{M}}(\\mathrm{double}\\text{-}\\zeta)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = -1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{0.212}{1.018}\\right) = -2 + \\frac{0.212}{1.018}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{-2(1.018) + 0.212}{1.018} = \\frac{-2.036 + 0.212}{1.018} = \\frac{-1.824}{1.018}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx -1.7917485...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $-1.792$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-1.792}\n$$", "id": "2906482"}]}
