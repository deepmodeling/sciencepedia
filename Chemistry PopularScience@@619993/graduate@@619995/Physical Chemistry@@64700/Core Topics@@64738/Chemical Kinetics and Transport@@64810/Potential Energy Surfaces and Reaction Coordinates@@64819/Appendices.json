It is a well-posed problem in classical mechanics and physical chemistry, grounded in the standard theoretical framework of reaction dynamics on a potential energy surface. All terms are clearly defined, and sufficient information is provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe potential energy surface, $V(q)$, is given by the one-dimensional quartic function:\n$$V(q) = a q^{4} - b q^{2}$$\nwhere $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. The parameters ensure a symmetric double-well potential, with two minima separated by a barrier.\n\nFirst, we must identify the stationary points of the potential. Stationary points are locations where the force, and thus the gradient of the potential, is zero. We compute the first derivative of $V(q)$ with respect to the reaction coordinate $q$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dq} = \\frac{d}{dq}(a q^{4} - b q^{2}) = 4 a q^{3} - 2 b q$$\nSetting $\\frac{dV}{dq} = 0$:\n$$4 a q^{3} - 2 b q = 0$$\n$$2q(2aq^2 - b) = 0$$\nThis equation yields three solutions for the coordinates of the stationary points:\n$$q = 0$$\nand\n$$q^{2} = \\frac{b}{2a} \\implies q = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$$\n\nNext, we must distinguish between minima (stable states) and the transition state (saddle point) by examining the curvature of the potential at these stationary points. The curvature is given by the second derivative, $V''(q)$.\n$$V''(q) = \\frac{d^{2}V}{dq^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dq}(4 a q^{3} - 2 b q) = 12 a q^{2} - 2 b$$\nWe evaluate $V''(q)$ at each stationary point:\n1.  For $q=0$:\n    $$V''(0) = 12 a (0)^{2} - 2 b = -2b$$\n    Since $b > 0$, the curvature $V''(0)$ is negative.

These points correspond to the potential energy minima.\n\nHaving identified the transition state coordinate as $q^{\\ddagger}=0$, we now determine the characteristic frequency of motion near this point.

The derivation starts from core definitions of a potential energy surface and transition states, and proceeds with well-tested mathematical procedures: least-squares fitting, derivative-based stationary point classification, and finite-difference curvature estimation.\n\nFirst principles and definitions. In a Born–Oppenheimer picture, the potential energy surface assigns an energy to each nuclear configuration; restricting to a single reaction coordinate $x$ produces a univariate function $V(x)$. A transition state along this coordinate is a point $x_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ with $V'(x_{\\mathrm{TS}}) = 0$ and $V''(x_{\\mathrm{TS}})  0$, while a reactant minimum is $x_{\\mathrm{R}}$ with $V'(x_{\\mathrm{R}}) = 0$ and $V''(x_{\\mathrm{R}}) > 0$. The barrier height relative to a reactant minimum is $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger} = V(x_{\\mathrm{TS}}) - V(x_{\\mathrm{R}})$. The curvature at a point is quantified by the second derivative $V''(x)$. For a fitted quartic $V(x) = a x^{4} + b x^{3} + c x^{2} + d x + e$, the derivatives are $V'(x) = 4 a x^{3} + 3 b x^{2} + 2 c x + d$ and $V''(x) = 12 a x^{2} + 6 b x + 2 c$.\n\nLeast-squares fitting. Given data $\\{(x_i, E_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, we find coefficients $(a,b,c,d,e)$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (V(x_i) - E_i)^2$. This is an ordinary least-squares linear regression in the basis $\\{x^{4}, x^{3}, x^{2}, x, 1\\}$, which can be written in matrix form $\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$, with $\\mathbf{X}_{i,:} = [x_i^{4}, x_i^{3}, x_i^{2}, x_i, 1]$, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [a, b, c, d, e]^{\\top}$, and $\\mathbf{y}_i = E_i$.

To locate candidate transition states and minima from the fit, we solve $V'(x) = 0$. Since $V'(x)$ is a cubic polynomial $4 a x^{3} + 3 b x^{2} + 2 c x + d$, it has at most three real roots. We compute all roots, retain those with negligible imaginary parts, and restrict to the interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ spanned by the supplied $x$ values. We then classify each real root $x^{*}$ by evaluating $V''(x^{*})$:\n- If $V''(x^{*})  0$, $x^{*}$ is a local maximum candidate. Among these, we select $x_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ as the one with the largest $V(x^{*})$. If there are no such stationary maxima within the interval, we revert to a fallback by taking the $x$ in $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ that maximizes $V(x)$, approximated on a sufficiently fine grid to avoid missing narrow features.\n- If $V''(x^{*}) > 0$, $x^{*}$ is a local minimum candidate. We select the predicted reactant minimum $x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}$ as the minimum candidate that is closest to the supplied reactant coordinate $x_{\\mathrm{R,data}}$ associated with the provided reactant index. If there is no such stationary minimum in the interval, we fall back to $x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}} = x_{\\mathrm{R,data}}$.\n\nBarrier height and RMSE. With $x_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}$ specified, we compute the fitted barrier height $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{fit}} = V(x_{\\mathrm{TS}}) - V(x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}})$. For the data-based barrier, we use $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{data}} = \\max_{i} E_i - E_{i_{\\mathrm{R}}}$, which is the best discrete approximation available without interpolation. The absolute barrier error is $|\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{fit}} - \\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{data}}|$. The root-mean-square error is computed as $\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{N^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (V(x_i) - E_i)^2}$ with $N$ the number of data points.\n\nCurvature from data. The curvature at the reactant from the fit is $V''(x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}) = 12 a x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}^{2} + 6 b x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}} + 2 c$. From discrete data, we approximate the curvature at the reactant index $i_{\\mathrm{R}}$ using a three-point finite-difference formula that is valid for nonuniform grids. Let $x_{-1} = x_{i_{\\mathrm{R}}-1}$, $x_{0} = x_{i_{\\mathrm{R}}}$, $x_{+1} = x_{i_{\\mathrm{R}}+1}$, and $E_{-1}$, $E_{0}$, $E_{+1}$ the corresponding energies. Then\n$$\n\\hat{V}''(x_0) \\approx 2\\left(\\frac{E_{-1}}{(x_{-1}-x_0)(x_{-1}-x_{+1})} + \\frac{E_{0}}{(x_0-x_{-1})(x_0-x_{+1})} + \\frac{E_{+1}}{(x_{+1}-x_{-1})(x_{+1}-x_0)}\\right).\n$$\nThis is derived by differentiating the unique quadratic Lagrange interpolant through the three points and evaluating the second derivative at $x_0$. The absolute curvature error is then $|V''(x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}) - \\hat{V}''(x_{i_{\\mathrm{R}}})|$.\n\nAlgorithmic implementation. For each case:\n- Construct the design matrix with columns $x^{4}$, $x^{3}$, $x^{2}$, $x$, and $1$, and solve the least-squares problem for $(a,b,c,d,e)$.\n- Compute roots of the derivative cubic and filter to real roots in $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$. Classify by $V''$ to identify maxima and minima.\n- Select $x_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}$ based on the rules above, with grid-based fallbacks within $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$ if needed.\n- Compute $\\mathrm{RMSE}$, the data barrier height $\\max_i E_i - E_{i_{\\mathrm{R}}}$, the fitted barrier height $V(x_{\\mathrm{TS}}) - V(x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}})$, the data curvature via the three-point formula, and the fitted curvature via $12 a x^{2} + 6 b x + 2 c$ at $x_{\\mathrm{R,fit}}$.\n- Take absolute differences for the barrier and curvature errors.\n- Round $\\mathrm{RMSE}$, barrier error, and curvature error to exactly $6$ decimal places.\n\nThe output aggregates the triplets for all three cases in a single bracketed list with comma-separated values, ensuring a concise, programmatically checkable format.
