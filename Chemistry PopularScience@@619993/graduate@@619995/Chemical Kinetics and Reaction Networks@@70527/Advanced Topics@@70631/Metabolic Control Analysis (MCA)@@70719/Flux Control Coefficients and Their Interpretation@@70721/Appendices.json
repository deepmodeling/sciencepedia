This implies that the rates of production and consumption of $S_1$ are equal:\n$$\nv_1(S_0) = v_2(S_1^\\ast)\n$$\nwhere $S_1^\\ast$ denotes the steady-state concentration of $S_1$. The steady-state flux, $J$, is the rate through the pathway at steady state, so $J = v_1(S_0) = v_2(S_1^\\ast)$.\n\nSince the external substrate concentration $S_0$ is chemostatted (held constant), the rate of the first step, $v_1$, is also constant for given enzyme parameters $V_1$ and $K_1$. This rate determines the flux through the entire pathway at steady state.\n$$\nJ = v_1(S_0) = \\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the steady-state flux $J$.\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration $S_1^\\ast$, we use the equality $J = v_2(S_1^\\ast)$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{V_2 S_1^\\ast}{K_2 + S_1^\\ast}\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $S_1^\\ast$:\n$$\nJ (K_2 + S_1^\\ast) = V_2 S_1^\\ast\n$$\n$$\nJ K_2 + J S_1^\\ast = V_2 S_1^\\ast\n$$\n$$\nJ K_2 = (V_2 - J) S_1^\\ast\n$$\n$$\nS_1^\\ast = \\frac{J K_2}{V_2 - J}\n$$\nThe problem statement provides the condition $\\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0} < V_2$, which is equivalent to $J < V_2$. This ensures that the denominator $(V_2 - J)$ is positive, leading to a physically realistic positive concentration $S_1^\\ast$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $J$ to obtain $S_1^\\ast$ in terms of the primary parameters:\n$$\nS_1^\\ast = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0}\\right) K_2}{V_2 - \\left(\\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0}\\right)}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $(K_1 + S_0)$ to simplify the expression gives:\n$$\nS_1^\\ast = \\frac{V_1 S_0 K_2}{V_2(K_1 + S_0) - V_1 S_0}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the steady-state concentration $S_1^\\ast$.\n\nDerivation of Flux Control Coefficients:\nThe flux control coefficient of flux $J$ with respect to enzyme $E_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nC_J^{E_i} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln E_i}\n$$\nWe are given that $V_i$ is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration $E_i$, via $V_i = k_{\\mathrm{cat},i} E_i$. Taking the logarithm gives $\\ln V_i = \\ln k_{\\mathrm{cat},i} + \\ln E_i$. Since $k_{\\mathrm{cat},i}$ is a constant, the differential elements are equal: $d(\\ln V_i) = d(\\ln E_i)$. Therefore, the control coefficient can be expressed in terms of $V_i$:\n$$\nC_J^{E_i} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln V_i}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the definition $C_J^{V_i} = \\frac{V_i}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V_i}$.\n\nTo calculate $C_J^{E_1}$, we use the expression for the flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0}\n$$\nTo calculate the coefficient, we can take the logarithm of $J$:\n$$\n\\ln J = \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0} \\right) = \\ln V_1 + \\ln S_0 - \\ln(K_1 + S_0)\n$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\ln V_1$. Since $S_0$ and $K_1$ are independent of $V_1$:\n$$\nC_J^{E_1} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln V_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln V_1} (\\ln V_1) = 1\n$$\nThus, the flux control coefficient for the first enzyme is exactly $1$.\n\nTo calculate $C_J^{E_2}$, we again examine the expression for the flux:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{V_1 S_0}{K_1 + S_0}\n$$\nThis expression does not depend on any parameters of the second reaction, including $V_2$ (and thus $E_2$). Therefore, the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $V_2$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V_2} = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the flux control coefficient is also zero:\n$$\nC_J^{E_2} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln V_2} = \\frac{V_2}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial V_2} = \\frac{V_2}{J} \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nIn this specific system, where the initial substrate is chemostatted and the steps are irreversible, the first step completely determines the pathway flux. The second enzyme, $E_2$, only influences the steady-state concentration of the intermediate metabolite $S_1$, but not the overall flux $J$.

The equation becomes:\n$$2 y^{2} + \\sqrt{K_{d}} y - E_{1T} = 0$$\nApplying the quadratic formula for $y$:\n$$y = \\frac{-\\sqrt{K_{d}} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{K_{d}})^{2} - 4(2)(-E_{1T})}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{K_{d}} \\pm \\sqrt{K_{d} + 8 E_{1T}}}{4}$$\nSince $y = \\sqrt{[E_{2}]}$ must be a positive real number, we must select the positive root:\n$$\\sqrt{[E_{2}]} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{K_{d}} + \\sqrt{K_{d} + 8 E_{1T}}}{4}$$\nSquaring this gives the explicit expression for $[E_{2}]$:\n$$[E_{2}] = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{K_{d} + 8 E_{1T}} - \\sqrt{K_{d}}}{4} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{(K_{d} + 8 E_{1T}) + K_{d} - 2\\sqrt{K_{d}(K_{d} + 8 E_{1T})}}{16} = \\frac{2K_{d} + 8 E_{1T} - 2\\sqrt{K_{d}^{2} + 8 K_{d} E_{1T}}}{16}$$\n$$[E_{2}] = \\frac{K_{d} + 4 E_{1T} - \\sqrt{K_{d}^{2} + 8 K_{d} E_{1T}}}{8}$$\nThe rate $v_{1}$ is then:\n$$v_{1} = \\lambda_{1} k_{1} \\left( \\frac{K_{d} + 4 E_{1T} - \\sqrt{K_{d}^{2} + 8 K_{d} E_{1T}}}{8} \\right)$$\nTo determine if $v_{1}$ is homogeneous of degree $1$ in $E_{1T}$, we must compute the elasticity coefficient $\\frac{\\partial \\ln v_{1}}{\\partial \\ln E_{1T}}$. If this quantity equals $1$, the function is homogeneous of degree $1$. If it depends on $E_{1T}$, it is not.\nSince $v_{1}$ is directly proportional to $[E_{2}]$, $\\frac{\\partial \\ln v_{1}}{\\partial \\ln E_{1T}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln [E_{2}]}{\\partial \\ln E_{1T}}$.\nWe use implicit differentiation on the relation $E_{1T} = \\sqrt{K_{d}[E_{2}]} + 2[E_{2}]$. Differentiating with respect to $E_{1T}$:\n$$1 = \\frac{d [E_{2}]}{d E_{1T}} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{K_{d}}}{2\\sqrt{[E_{2}]}} + 2 \\right)$$\nUsing $[E] = \\sqrt{K_d[E_2]}$, the term in the parentheses is $\\frac{[E]}{2[E_2]} + 2$.\nSo, $\\frac{d [E_{2}]}{d E_{1T}} = \\left( \\frac{[E]}{2[E_{2}]} + 2 \\right)^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{[E] + 4[E_{2}]}{2[E_{2}]} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2[E_{2}]}{[E] + 4[E_{2}]}$.\nThe elasticity is $\\frac{\\partial \\ln [E_{2}]}{\\partial \\ln E_{1T}} = \\frac{E_{1T}}{[E_{2}]} \\frac{d [E_{2}]}{d E_{1T}} = \\frac{E_{1T}}{[E_{2}]} \\frac{2[E_{2}]}{[E] + 4[E_{2}]} = \\frac{2 E_{1T}}{[E] + 4[E_{2}]}$.\nUsing the conservation law $E_{1T} = [E] + 2[E_{2}]$, we substitute $[E] = E_{1T} - 2[E_{2}]$ into the elasticity expression:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln v_{1}}{\\partial \\ln E_{1T}} = \\frac{2 E_{1T}}{(E_{1T} - 2[E_{2}]) + 4[E_{2}]} = \\frac{2 E_{1T}}{E_{1T} + 2[E_{2}]}$$\nSince $[E_{2}]$ is a non-linear function of $E_{1T}$, this elasticity is not a constant. For example, in the limit of high enzyme concentration ($E_{1T} \\to \\infty$), the enzyme is almost entirely in the dimeric form, so $2[E_{2}] \\approx E_{1T}$. The elasticity approaches $\\frac{2E_{1T}}{E_{1T} + E_{1T}} = 1$. In the limit of low enzyme concentration ($E_{1T} \\to 0$), the monomer predominates, so $[E] \\approx E_{1T}$. Then $[E_{2}] \\approx [E]^{2}/K_{d} \\approx E_{1T}^{2}/K_{d}$. The elasticity approaches $\\frac{2E_{1T}}{E_{1T} + 2(E_{1T}^2/K_d)} \\approx \\frac{2E_{1T}}{E_{1T}} = 2$.\nAs the elasticity is not identically equal to $1$, the rate $v_{1}$ is not homogeneous of degree $1$ in $E_{1T}$.\n\nTask 2: Scaling of steady state and flux.\nAt steady state, $v_{1} = v_{2}$. Let $X_{ss}$ be the steady-state concentration of $X$.\n$$\\lambda_{1} k_{1} [E_{2}] = \\lambda_{2} \\frac{V_{2} X_{ss}}{K_{2} + X_{ss}}$$\nThe term $[E_{2}]$ is a function of $E_{1T}$ and $K_{d}$ only, and does not depend on $X$ or the activity multipliers. Let us define a constant $g_{1} \\equiv k_{1} [E_{2}]$.\nThe steady-state equation is $\\lambda_{1} g_{1} = \\lambda_{2} \\frac{V_{2} X_{ss}}{K_{2} + X_{ss}}$.\nThis equation determines the value of $X_{ss}$.\nNow, consider scaling both activity multipliers by a factor $\\mu > 0$: $\\lambda_{1} \\mapsto \\mu \\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2} \\mapsto \\mu \\lambda_{2}$. Let the new steady-state concentration be $X'_{ss}$. The new steady-state equation is:\n$$(\\mu\\lambda_{1}) g_{1} = (\\mu\\lambda_{2}) \\frac{V_{2} X'_{ss}}{K_{2} + X'_{ss}}$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\mu$:\n$$\\lambda_{1} g_{1} = \\lambda_{2} \\frac{V_{2} X'_{ss}}{K_{2} + X'_{ss}}$$\nThis equation for $X'_{ss}$ is identical to the original equation for $X_{ss}$. We must check if the solution is unique. The function $f(X) = \\frac{V_2 X}{K_2+X}$ has a derivative $f'(X) = \\frac{V_2 K_2}{(K_2+X)^2} > 0$ for $X>0$. Thus, $f(X)$ is strictly monotonic, and the solution for $X_{ss}$ is unique. Therefore, it must be that $X'_{ss} = X_{ss}$. The steady-state concentration of the intermediate is unchanged.\nThe steady-state flux is $J = v_{1} = \\lambda_{1} g_{1}$. The new steady-state flux, $J'$, is given by:\n$$J' = (\\mu\\lambda_{1}) g_{1} = \\mu (\\lambda_{1} g_{1}) = \\mu J$$\nThus, the steady-state flux $J$ scales linearly with the common factor $\\mu$.\n\nTask 3: Sum of flux control coefficients.\nThe result from Task 2 demonstrates that the steady-state flux, considered as a function $J(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2})$, is a homogeneous function of degree $1$. That is, for any $\\mu > 0$:\n$$J(\\mu \\lambda_{1}, \\mu \\lambda_{2}) = \\mu J(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2})$$\nWe can now apply Euler's theorem for homogeneous functions. For a function $f(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n})$ that is homogeneous of degree $k$, the theorem states:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{i}} = k f$$\nIn our case, the function is $J(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2})$, the variables are $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$, and the degree of homogeneity is $k=1$. Applying the theorem yields:\n$$\\lambda_{1} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\lambda_{1}} + \\lambda_{2} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\lambda_{2}} = 1 \\cdot J$$\nTo relate this to the flux control coefficients, we divide the entire equation by the steady-state flux $J$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\lambda_{1}} + \\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\lambda_{2}} = 1$$\nThe definition of the flux control coefficient is $C_{J}^{(i)} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln \\lambda_{i}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{i}}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\lambda_{i}}$.\nSubstituting these definitions into the equation derived from Euler's theorem, we find:\n$$C_{J}^{(1)} + C_{J}^{(2)} = 1$$\nThis is a specific case of the flux summation theorem of Metabolic Control Analysis. The result is a direct and necessary consequence of the homogeneity property of the system's kinetic structure. The sum of the flux control coefficients with respect to the activities of all enzymes in the pathway is unity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2645319"}]}
