It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no logical contradictions, missing data, or unscientific premises. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe first task is to determine the steady state of the system, denoted by $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$. By definition, a steady state is a point where all time derivatives are zero. Thus, we must solve the following system of algebraic equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \\implies A - (B+1)x^{\\ast} + (x^{\\ast})^{2}y^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\implies Bx^{\\ast} - (x^{\\ast})^{2}y^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad (2)\n$$\nThe problem requires a *strictly positive* steady state, so we assume $x^{\\ast} > 0$ and $y^{\\ast} > 0$. From equation $(2)$, we can factor out $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} (B - x^{\\ast}y^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\nSince $x^{\\ast} > 0$, we must have $B - x^{\\ast}y^{\\ast} = 0$, which implies $(x^{\\ast})^{2}y^{\\ast} = Bx^{\\ast}$. A direct substitution of this result into equation $(1)$ yields:\n$$\nA - (B+1)x^{\\ast} + Bx^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - Bx^{\\ast} - x^{\\ast} + Bx^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - x^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the steady-state concentration for $x$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = A\n$$\nTo find the corresponding steady-state concentration $y^{\\ast}$, we substitute $x^{\\ast} = A$ back into the relation $B - x^{\\ast}y^{\\ast} = 0$:\n$$\nB - Ay^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nSince $A > 0$ is a given condition, we can solve for $y^{\\ast}$:\n$$\ny^{\\ast} = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThe unique strictly positive steady state is therefore $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = (A, \\frac{B}{A})$. The conditions $A > 0$ and $B > 0$ ensure that both $x^{\\ast}$ and $y^{\\ast}$ are indeed strictly positive.\n\nThe next task is to compute the Jacobian matrix of the vector field $F(x,y) = (f(x,y), g(x,y))$ at this steady state. The general Jacobian matrix $J(x,y)$ is defined as:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives from the given rate equations:\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (A - (B+1)x + x^2y) = -(B+1) + 2xy$\n- $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (A - (B+1)x + x^2y) = x^2$\n- $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (Bx - x^2y) = B - 2xy$\n- $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (Bx - x^2y) = -x^2$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is therefore:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2xy - B - 1 & x^2 \\\\ B - 2xy & -x^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this matrix at the steady state $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = (A, \\frac{B}{A})$. At this point, the product $x^{\\ast}y^{\\ast}$ simplifies to $A \\cdot \\frac{B}{A} = B$. Substituting $x = A$ and $xy = B$ into the Jacobian entries gives:\n$$\nJ(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2B - B - 1 & A^2 \\\\ B - 2B & -A^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} B - 1 & A^2 \\\\ -B & -A^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the trace and determinant of this matrix.\nThe trace, $\\text{Tr}(J)$, is the sum of the main diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(J) = (B - 1) + (-A^2) = B - A^2 - 1\n$$\nThe determinant, $\\text{Det}(J)$, is given by the formula $ad - bc$:\n$$\n\\text{Det}(J) = (B - 1)(-A^2) - (A^2)(-B) = -A^2B + A^2 + A^2B = A^2\n$$\nThe problem requests the final answer as an ordered pair of (trace, determinant) in a single row matrix.

This tangency condition is met when the derivative of the function with respect to the state variable is also zero.

The Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the concentration $x(t)$ of the dynamic species is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$, where the rate function is $f(x) = k_1 a x^{2} - k_2 x^{3} + k_3 b - k_4 x$.\n2.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested bound. The parameters given are dimensionally and physically consistent within the framework of mass-action kinetics. The problem is not trivial and requires a clear application of calculus to analyze the properties of the rate function. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. The steady states of the system are the values of $x$ for which $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, which corresponds to the roots of the equation $f(x) = 0$. If the function $f(x)$ is injective on the domain $[0, \\infty)$, it means that for any two distinct points $x_1, x_2 \\in [0, \\infty)$, we have $f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$. This implies that the equation $f(x) = C$ can have at most one solution for any constant $C$. In particular, for $C=0$, there can be at most one steady state. Thus, ensuring the injectivity of $f(x)$ on $[0, \\infty)$ is a sufficient condition to preclude the existence of multiple steady states.\n\nThe problem states to use the Jacobian Injectivity Criterion (JIC). For a one-dimensional, continuously differentiable function $f(x)$ defined on an interval, this criterion simplifies to the condition that its derivative, $f'(x)$, must not change sign over the interval. In this context, the Jacobian matrix is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix whose only entry is the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$.\n\nLet us rewrite the function $f(x)$ in order of descending powers of $x$:\n$$\nf(x) = -k_2 x^{3} + k_1 a x^{2} - k_4 x + k_3 b\n$$\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d f}{d x} = -3 k_2 x^{2} + 2 k_1 a x - k_4\n$$\nThe function $f'(x)$ is a quadratic function of $x$. Since $k_2 > 0$, the coefficient of the $x^{2}$ term, which is $-3 k_2$, is strictly negative. This means that the graph of $y = f'(x)$ is a parabola opening downwards.\n\nTo ensure that $f'(x)$ does not change sign on the domain $[0, \\infty)$, we first evaluate it at the boundary point $x=0$:\n$$\nf'(0) = -k_4\n$$\nSince $k_4 > 0$, we have $f'(0) < 0$. Because the parabola opens downwards and its value at $x=0$ is negative, for $f'(x)$ to not change sign on $[0, \\infty)$, it must be non-positive for all $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. Formally, we require $f'(x) \\le 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$.\n\nA downward-opening parabola's maximum value will determine if it is ever positive. The vertex of the parabola $y = A x^2 + B x + C$ is located at $x_v = -\\frac{B}{2A}$. For $f'(x) = (-3 k_2) x^2 + (2 k_1 a) x + (-k_4)$, the vertex is at:\n$$\nx_v = - \\frac{2 k_1 a}{2(-3 k_2)} = \\frac{k_1 a}{3 k_2}\n$$\nSince $k_1, a, k_2$ are all positive, the vertex occurs at a positive value of $x$, so it lies within the domain of interest $(0, \\infty)$. The maximum value of $f'(x)$ on $[0, \\infty)$ occurs at this vertex. The condition that $f'(x) \\le 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$ is therefore equivalent to requiring that the maximum value of the function is non-positive, i.e., $f'(x_v) \\le 0$.\n\nWe substitute $x_v$ into the expression for $f'(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x_v) = f'\\left(\\frac{k_1 a}{3 k_2}\\right) = -3 k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1 a}{3 k_2}\\right)^{2} + 2 k_1 a \\left(\\frac{k_1 a}{3 k_2}\\right) - k_4 \\le 0\n$$\nSimplifying this inequality:\n$$\n-3 k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1^{2} a^{2}}{9 k_2^{2}}\\right) + \\frac{2 k_1^{2} a^{2}}{3 k_2} - k_4 \\le 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{k_1^{2} a^{2}}{3 k_2} + \\frac{2 k_1^{2} a^{2}}{3 k_2} - k_4 \\le 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{k_1^{2} a^{2}}{3 k_2} - k_4 \\le 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_1^{2} a^{2}}{3 k_2} \\le k_4\n$$\n$$\nk_1^{2} a^{2} \\le 3 k_2 k_4\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (since $a, k_1, k_2, k_4$ are all positive, quantities are non-negative):\n$$\nk_1 a \\le \\sqrt{3 k_2 k_4}\n$$\n$$\na \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{3 k_2 k_4}}{k_1}\n$$\nThis inequality gives the condition on $a$ for which $f(x)$ is injective on $[0, \\infty)$.
