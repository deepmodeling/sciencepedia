The observed second-order catalytic efficiency is controlled by the fraction of enzyme in the catalytically competent protonation state and by the activation free energy. A single mutation creates a uniform shift in the local electrostatic potential at the active site without changing any other structural feature. Assume the following foundational relationships:\n- The TST rate constant depends on the activation free energy via an exponential Boltzmann factor.\n- The fraction of enzyme in the deprotonated base form at a given acidity is governed by the Henderson–Hasselbalch law.\n- The electrostatic contribution to a free energy for a state of charge $q$ in an electrostatic potential $\\phi$ is $q\\,\\phi$ per molecule, and its molar counterpart is $q\\,F\\,\\phi$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nConsider the wild type enzyme at temperature $T=310\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and acidity $\\mathrm{pH}=7.40$.

It is a valid problem. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Characteristic Timescale\nThe total concentration of protons, both free ($[\\mathrm{H}^+]$) and bound to the buffer ($[\\mathrm{BH}]$), is a conserved quantity with respect to transport. Let $h(r, t) = [\\mathrm{H}^+]$ and $b(r, t) = [\\mathrm{BH}]$. The total mobile proton concentration is $H_{total} = h + b$. The conservation law for $H_{total}$ is given by the continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (h+b)}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}_{total} $$\nThe total flux, $\\vec{J}_{total}$, is the sum of the flux of free protons, $\\vec{J}_H$, and the flux of the protonated buffer, $\\vec{J}_b$:\n$$ \\vec{J}_{total} = \\vec{J}_H + \\vec{J}_b = -D_H \\nabla h - D_B \\nabla b $$\nCombining these gives the reaction-diffusion equation for total protons:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} = D_H \\nabla^2 h + D_B \\nabla^2 b $$\nAccording to assumption (iii), the buffer reaction is in quasi-equilibrium. The acid dissociation equilibrium is:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}^-][\\mathrm{H}^+]}{[\\mathrm{BH}]} = \\frac{(C_B - b)h}{b} $$\nFrom this, we express the concentration of the protonated buffer, $b$, as a function of the free proton concentration, $h$:\n$$ b(h) = \\frac{C_B h}{K_a + h} $$\nWe are considering small perturbations around the bulk equilibrium state, so we let $h = h_\\infty + \\delta h$, where $\\delta h \\ll h_\\infty$. We linearize the function $b(h)$ around $h_\\infty$:\n$$ b(h) \\approx b(h_\\infty) + \\left. \\frac{db}{dh} \\right|_{h=h_\\infty} \\delta h $$\nThe derivative $\\frac{db}{dh}$ is the differential buffer capacity:\n$$ \\frac{db}{dh} = \\frac{d}{dh}\\left(\\frac{C_B h}{K_a + h}\\right) = \\frac{C_B(K_a+h) - C_B h}{(K_a+h)^2} = \\frac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h)^2} $$\nLet us denote the buffer capacity at $h_\\infty$ as $\\beta$:\n$$ \\beta = \\left. \\frac{db}{dh} \\right|_{h=h_\\infty} = \\frac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2} $$\nThe perturbation in the protonated buffer concentration is then $\\delta b = b - b_\\infty \\approx \\beta \\delta h$.\n\nSubstituting the perturbations $h=h_\\infty+\\delta h$ and $b=b_\\infty+\\delta b$ into the reaction-diffusion equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (\\delta b)}{\\partial t} = D_H \\nabla^2 (\\delta h) + D_B \\nabla^2 (\\delta b) $$\nUsing $\\delta b \\approx \\beta \\delta h$, and noting that $\\beta$ is a constant, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} = D_H \\nabla^2 (\\delta h) + D_B \\beta \\nabla^2 (\\delta h) $$\n$$ (1+\\beta) \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} = (D_H + \\beta D_B) \\nabla^2 (\\delta h) $$\nThis can be rearranged into the form of a standard diffusion equation for the perturbation $\\delta h$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} = \\left(\\frac{D_H + \\beta D_B}{1+\\beta}\\right) \\nabla^2 (\\delta h) $$\nThis equation defines an effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{eff}$, for the propagation of a proton concentration perturbation in a buffered solution:\n$$ D_{eff} = \\frac{D_H + \\beta D_B}{1+\\beta} = \\frac{D_H + \\left(\\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right) D_B}{1 + \\left(\\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right)} $$\nThe characteristic time $\\tau$ for a diffusion process over a length scale $L$ is given by $\\tau \\approx L^2/D_{eff}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\tau \\approx \\frac{L^2}{D_{eff}} = \\frac{L^2}{\\dfrac{D_H + \\displaystyle \\left(\\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right) D_B}{1 + \\displaystyle \\left(\\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right)}} $$\nThis expression matches the formula given in option C.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe now calculate the numerical value of $\\tau$.\nFirst, calculate the buffer capacity term $\\beta$:\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M}) (10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M})}{(10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M} + 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M})^2} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{(2 \\times 10^{-7})^2} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{4 \\times 10^{-14}} = 1.25 \\times 10^5 $$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, representing the ratio of buffer-bound protons to free protons for a given change in concentration.\nNext, calculate $D_{eff}$:\n$$ D_{eff} = \\frac{D_H + \\beta D_B}{1+\\beta} = \\frac{(9.3 \\times 10^{-9}) + (1.25 \\times 10^5)(7.0 \\times 10^{-10})}{1 + 1.25 \\times 10^5} $$\n$$ D_{eff} = \\frac{9.3 \\times 10^{-9} + 8.75 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.25001 \\times 10^5} \\approx \\frac{8.75 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.25 \\times 10^5} = 7.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} $$\nAs expected, since $\\beta \\gg 1$, the effective diffusivity is dominated by the slower diffusion of the buffer species: $D_{eff} \\approx D_B$.\nFinally, calculate the timescale $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau \\approx \\frac{L^2}{D_{eff}} = \\frac{(10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{7.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{10^{-16}}{7.0 \\times 10^{-10}}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.43 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThis value is of the order of $10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n-   **A. $\\tau \\approx \\dfrac{L^2}{D_H}$, independent of buffering; numerically $\\sim 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.**\n    This expression ignores the effect of the buffer entirely. It describes proton diffusion in pure water. Our derivation shows that the buffer has a dramatic effect, slowing down the effective diffusion. Numerically, $\\tau \\approx (10^{-8})^2 / (9.3 \\times 10^{-9}) \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The formula is physically incorrect for this problem. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. $\\tau \\approx \\dfrac{L^2}{D_H}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right)$; numerically $\\sim 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.**\n    This expression is $\\tau \\approx (L^2/D_H)(1+\\beta)$. This would arise from an incorrect model where the buffer capacity slows proton diffusion without the buffer itself diffusing. The derived correct form is $\\tau \\approx L^2/D_{eff}$. This option's formula is physically incorrect. Numerically, $\\tau \\approx (1.1 \\times 10^{-8})(1.25 \\times 10^5) \\approx 1.4 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The formula is wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. $\\tau \\approx \\dfrac{L^2}{\\dfrac{D_H + \\displaystyle \\left(\\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right) D_B}{1 + \\displaystyle \\left(\\dfrac{C_B K_a}{(K_a + h_\\infty)^2}\\right)}}$; numerically $\\sim 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.**\n    This formula for the timescale is $\\tau \\approx L^2/D_{eff}$, which is precisely what was derived from first principles. The effective diffusion coefficient is correctly expressed as a weighted average of the diffusivities of the free proton and the buffer species, with the weighting determined by the buffer capacity. Our numerical calculation, $\\tau \\approx 1.43 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}$, matches the provided order of magnitude. This option is physically and mathematically sound. **Correct**.\n\n-   **D. $\\tau \\approx \\dfrac{L^2}{D_H + D_B}$, where buffer changes only add diffusivities; numerically $\\sim 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.**\n    This expression implies an effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff} = D_H + D_B$. This is a naive and incorrect summation of transport coefficients; the correct form is a weighted average as derived above. Numerically, $\\tau \\approx (10^{-8})^2 / (9.3 \\times 10^{-9} + 7.0 \\times 10^{-10}) = 10^{-16} / (10 \\times 10^{-9}) = 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The formula is physically wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. $\\tau \\approx \\dfrac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} C_B + k_{\\mathrm{off}}}$, controlled solely by buffer reaction rates and independent of $L$, $D_H$, or $D_B$.**\n    This expression represents the timescale of the chemical relaxation of the buffer itself. The problem explicitly assumes that this process is very fast compared to diffusion (\"quasi-equilibrium\"). Therefore, the overall relaxation timescale is limited by the slower process, which is diffusion. This option contradicts a fundamental assumption of the problem setup. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2682518"}]}
