The total rate of RuBP turnover, $v_{total}$, is the sum of the rates of the two reactions:\n$$ v_{total} = v_c + v_o $$\nThe fraction $f_{\\mathrm{oxy}}$ is the ratio of the oxygenation rate to the total rate:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = \\frac{v_o}{v_{total}} = \\frac{v_o}{v_c + v_o} $$\nTo solve for $f_{\\mathrm{oxy}}$ using the known quantities, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $v_o$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{v_c}{v_o} + 1} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the rate ratio $\\frac{v_c}{v_o}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = \\frac{1}{S_{c/o} \\frac{C}{O} + 1} $$\nThis expression allows direct calculation of $f_{\\mathrm{oxy}}$ from the given data.\n\nWe are given:\n- $S_{c/o} = 100$\n- $C = [\\mathrm{CO_2}] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $O = [\\mathrm{O_2}] = 250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of substrate concentrations:\n$$ \\frac{C}{O} = \\frac{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{250\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{10}{250} = \\frac{1}{25} = 0.04 $$\nNext, we substitute this value into the derived formula for $f_{\\mathrm{oxy}}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = \\frac{1}{(100)(0.04) + 1} $$\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = \\frac{1}{4 + 1} = \\frac{1}{5} $$\nThe value of the fraction is $0.2$.

The statistical weight of any other state is its equilibrium concentration relative to $[R]$.\n\nThe microstates and their weights are as follows, where we use the provided dimensionless concentrations: $c_1^R = [S_1]/K_{R1}$, $c_1^T = [S_1]/K_{T1}$, $c_2^R = [S_2]/K_{R2}$, $c_2^T = [S_2]/K_{T2}$, $a^R = [X]/K_{XR}$, and $a^T = [X]/K_{XT}$.\n\nFor the $R$ conformation, there are $6$ microstates:\n- Enzyme alone: $R$, weight $= 1$\n- Ligand-bound states:\n  - $RS_1$: weight $= [S_1]/K_{R1} = c_1^R$\n  - $RS_2$: weight $= [S_2]/K_{R2} = c_2^R$\n  - $RX$: weight $= [X]/K_{XR} = a^R$\n  - $RS_1X$: weight $= ([S_1]/K_{R1})([X]/K_{XR}) = c_1^R a^R$\n  - $RS_2X$: weight $= ([S_2]/K_{R2})([X]/K_{XR}) = c_2^R a^R$\n\nFor the $T$ conformation, the weights are scaled by the allosteric constant $L_0$:\n- Enzyme alone: $T$, weight $= L_0$\n- Ligand-bound states:\n  - $TS_1$: weight $= L_0 ([S_1]/K_{T1}) = L_0 c_1^T$\n  - $TS_2$: weight $= L_0 ([S_2]/K_{T2}) = L_0 c_2^T$\n  - $TX$: weight $= L_0 ([X]/K_{XT}) = L_0 a^T$\n  - $TS_1X$: weight $= L_0 ([S_1]/K_{T1})([X]/K_{XT}) = L_0 c_1^T a^T$\n  - $TS_2X$: weight $= L_0 ([S_2]/K_{T2})([X]/K_{XT}) = L_0 c_2^T a^T$\n\nThe total partition function, $Q$, is the sum of all statistical weights, representing the sum over all states normalized to the concentration of free $R$.\n$$Q = \\sum (\\text{weights of all states})$$\n\nDue to the assumption of independent binding at the catalytic and regulatory sites within a given conformation, we can factor the sums for each conformation.\nThe sum of weights for the $R$ states is:\n$$Q_R = 1 + c_1^R + c_2^R + a^R + c_1^R a^R + c_2^R a^R = (1 + c_1^R + c_2^R)(1 + a^R)$$\nThe sum of weights for the $T$ states is:\n$$Q_T = L_0 (1 + c_1^T + c_2^T + a^T + c_1^T a^T + c_2^T a^T) = L_0 (1 + c_1^T + c_2^T)(1 + a^T)$$\nThe total partition function is the sum of these:\n$$Q = Q_R + Q_T = (1 + c_1^R + c_2^R)(1 + a^R) + L_0 (1 + c_1^T + c_2^T)(1 + a^T)$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy of any given state is its statistical weight divided by $Q$. The total velocity of product formation from a substrate is the sum of the velocities from each catalytically competent complex containing that substrate.\n\nThe catalytically competent species for substrate $S_1$ are $RS_1$, $RS_1X$, $TS_1$, and $TS_1X$. The total velocity $v_1$ is:\n$$v_1 = k^{R}_{\\text{cat},1}([RS_1] + [RS_1X]) + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},1}([TS_1] + [TS_1X])$$\nExpressing concentrations in terms of fractional occupancies of the total enzyme concentration $E_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$v_1 = E_{\\text{tot}} \\left( k^{R}_{\\text{cat},1} \\frac{c_1^R + c_1^R a^R}{Q} + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},1} \\frac{L_0 c_1^T + L_0 c_1^T a^T}{Q} \\right)$$\nFactoring and simplifying gives the expression for $v_1$:\n$$v_1 = \\frac{E_{\\text{tot}}}{Q} \\left[ k^{R}_{\\text{cat},1}c_1^R(1+a^R) + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},1}L_0 c_1^T(1+a^T) \\right]$$\n\nSimilarly, the catalytically competent species for substrate $S_2$ are $RS_2$, $RS_2X$, $TS_2$, and $TS_2X$. The total velocity $v_2$ is:\n$$v_2 = k^{R}_{\\text{cat},2}([RS_2] + [RS_2X]) + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},2}([TS_2] + [TS_2X])$$\nWhich simplifies to:\n$$v_2 = \\frac{E_{\\text{tot}}}{Q} \\left[ k^{R}_{\\text{cat},2}c_2^R(1+a^R) + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},2}L_0 c_2^T(1+a^T) \\right]$$\n\nThe multiplex specificity index $\\varphi$ is defined as the ratio of the two velocities, $\\varphi = v_1 / v_2$. The common factor of $E_{\\text{tot}}/Q$ cancels, yielding the final expression:\n$$\\varphi = \\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\frac{k^{R}_{\\text{cat},1}c_1^R(1+a^R) + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},1}L_0 c_1^T(1+a^T)}{k^{R}_{\\text{cat},2}c_2^R(1+a^R) + k^{T}_{\\text{cat},2}L_0 c_2^T(1+a^T)}$$\nThe implementation will calculate this quantity for each given set of parameters. While $\\varphi$ itself is independent of $E_{\\text{tot}}$ and $Q$, the problem requests the calculation of $v_1$ and $v_2$ internally, thus requiring the calculation of $Q$ as an intermediate step. This does not alter the final value of $\\varphi$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the multiplex specificity index for an allosteric enzyme with two\n    competing substrates and one effector, based on the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # E_tot, L0, KR1, KT1, KR2, KT2, KXR, KXT, kR_cat1, kT_cat1, kR_cat2, kT_cat2, S1, S2, X\n        (0.1, 10, 5, 50, 10, 100, 10, 100, 50, 1, 40, 0.5, 10, 10, 0),\n        (0.1, 10, 5, 50, 10, 100, 10, 100, 50, 1, 40, 0.5, 10, 10, 100),\n        (0.1, 10, 5, 50, 10, 100, 10, 100, 50, 1, 40, 0.5, 200, 5, 0),\n        (0.1, 50, 5, 50, 10, 100, 10, 100, 50, 1, 40, 0.5, 5, 5, 100),\n        (0.1, 10, 5, 50, 10, 100, 10, 100, 50, 1, 200, 0.5, 10, 10, 20),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        E_tot, L0, KR1, KT1, KR2, KT2, KXR, KXT, kR_cat1, kT_cat1, kR_cat2, kT_cat2, S1, S2, X = case\n\n        # Calculate dimensionless binding activities\n        c1R = S1 / KR1\n        c1T = S1 / KT1\n        c2R = S2 / KR2\n        c2T = S2 / KT2\n        aR = X / KXR\n        aT = X / KXT\n        \n        # Calculate the partition function Q.\n        # Although Q cancels in the final specificity ratio, the problem asks to\n        # derive and implement via the velocities v1 and v2, which depend on Q.\n        Q_R = (1 + c1R + c2R) * (1 + aR)\n        Q_T = L0 * (1 + c1T + c2T) * (1 + aT)\n        Q = Q_R + Q_T\n\n        # Numerators of the velocity expressions for v1 and v2\n        v1_num = kR_cat1 * c1R * (1 + aR) + kT_cat1 * L0 * c1T * (1 + aT)\n        v2_num = kR_cat2 * c2R * (1 + aR) + kT_cat2 * L0 * c2T * (1 + aT)\n        \n        # Calculate velocities v1 and v2\n        v1 = E_tot * v1_num / Q\n        v2 = E_tot * v2_num / Q\n        \n        # Calculate the multiplex specificity index phi\n        # This can also be calculated as v1_num / v2_num\n        if v2 == 0:\n            # This case is not expected with the given positive parameters\n            # but is handled for robustness.\n            phi = float('inf')  \n        else:\n            phi = v1 / v2\n        \n        # Round to six decimal places as required\n        results.append(f\"{phi:.6f}\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2629954"}]}
