It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium and statistical mechanics as applied to macromolecular binding, is well-posed, and uses objective, formal language. It represents a standard derivation in biophysical chemistry. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the homomeric oligomer be denoted by $P$ and the ligand by $L$. The protein has $n$ identical and distinguishable binding sites. A macrostate is characterized by the number of ligands bound, irrespective of which specific sites are occupied. Let $[PL_i]$ denote the total concentration of the protein with $i$ ligands bound.\n\nThe macroscopic Adair constants, $K^{(A)}_i$, describe the stepwise association of the ligand to the protein in terms of macrostates. The $i$-th step of this macroscopic process is the equilibrium:\n$$\nPL_{i-1} + L \\rightleftharpoons PL_i\n$$\nBy definition, the corresponding Adair association constant $K^{(A)}_i$ is given by the law of mass action applied to the total concentrations of the macrostates:\n$$\nK^{(A)}_i = \\frac{[PL_i]}{[PL_{i-1}][L]}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $K^{(A)}_i$, we must relate these macroscopic concentrations to the underlying microscopic states. A microstate is a specific configuration of bound ligands, i.e., it specifies exactly which of the $n$ sites are occupied.\n\nLet $c_k^*$ be the concentration of a single, specific microstate with $k$ ligands bound. The problem states that due to symmetry, all microstates with the same number of bound ligands have equal concentration. The number of distinct microstates corresponding to the macrostate $PL_k$ is the number of ways to choose $k$ occupied sites from a total of $n$ sites, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, the total concentration of a macrostate is the product of the number of its constituent microstates and the concentration of any single one of them:\n$$\n[PL_i] = \\binom{n}{i} c_i^*\n$$\n$$\n[PL_{i-1}] = \\binom{n}{i-1} c_{i-1}^*\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of the Adair constant gives:\n$$\nK^{(A)}_i = \\frac{\\binom{n}{i} c_i^*}{\\binom{n}{i-1} c_{i-1}^* [L]}\n$$\nNow, we must consider the microscopic equilibrium. The constant $K_i$ is defined as the microscopic stepwise association constant for adding the $i$-th ligand to a specific unoccupied site of a protein that already has $i-1$ ligands bound. Let us consider the equilibrium between a specific microstate with $i-1$ ligands bound (concentration $c_{i-1}^*$) and a specific microstate with $i$ ligands bound (concentration $c_i^*$). The equilibrium constant for this single-site binding event is $K_i$:\n$$\nK_i = \\frac{c_i^*}{c_{i-1}^* [L]}\n$$\nThis equation directly follows from the definition of $K_i$ and the symmetry assumption. This relation can be rearranged to express the ratio of microstate concentrations:\n$$\n\\frac{c_i^*}{c_{i-1}^* [L]} = K_i\n$$\nWe can now substitute this microscopic relationship back into our expression for the macroscopic Adair constant $K^{(A)}_i$:\n$$\nK^{(A)}_i = \\frac{\\binom{n}{i}}{\\binom{n}{i-1}} \\left( \\frac{c_i^*}{c_{i-1}^* [L]} \\right) = \\frac{\\binom{n}{i}}{\\binom{n}{i-1}} K_i\n$$\nThe final step is to simplify the ratio of the binomial coefficients.

It is self-contained and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\na) Derivation of the binding polynomial and fractional saturation $Y(x)$\n\nThe MWC model for a homodimeric protein considers two conformational states, a relaxed state $R$ and a tense state $T$. The equilibrium between these states in the absence of ligand is given by the allosteric constant $L = [T]_0/[R]_0$. The ligand $X$ can bind to each of the two identical and independent sites on either conformation. The microscopic dissociation constants are $K_R$ for the $R$ state and $K_T$ for the $T$ state. We are given the dimensionless quantities $c = K_R/K_T$ and $x = [X]/K_R$.\n\nThe system can exist in several microstates, distinguished by conformation ($R$ or $T$) and the number of bound ligands ($0$, $1$, or $2$). We define the statistical weight of the unbound relaxed state, $R_0$, as $1$. All other weights are relative to this reference state.\n\nFor the $R$ state, which has $2$ identical binding sites for ligand $X$ with microscopic dissociation constant $K_R$:\n-   The weight of $R_0$ (unbound) is $1$.\n-   The weight of $R_1$ (one ligand bound) is $\\binom{2}{1} \\frac{[X]}{K_R} = 2x$.\n-   The weight of $R_2$ (two ligands bound) is $\\binom{2}{2} \\left(\\frac{[X]}{K_R}\\right)^2 = x^2$.\nThe sum of weights for all species in the $R$ conformation forms the partition function for the $R$ state, $Q_R(x) = 1 + 2x + x^2 = (1+x)^2$.\n\nFor the $T$ state, the microscopic dissociation constant is $K_T = K_R/c$. The dimensionless ligand binding term is $[X]/K_T = ([X]/K_R) \\cdot (K_R/K_T) = xc$.\nThe weight of the unbound $T$ state, $T_0$, relative to $R_0$ is $L$.\n-   The weight of $T_0$ is $L$.\n-   The weight of $T_1$ is $L \\cdot \\binom{2}{1} \\frac{[X]}{K_T} = L \\cdot 2cx$.\n-   The weight of $T_2$ is $L \\cdot \\binom{2}{2} \\left(\\frac{[X]}{K_T}\\right)^2 = L \\cdot (cx)^2$.\nThe sum of weights for all species in the $T$ conformation, relative to $R_0$, is $Q_T(x) = L(1 + 2cx + (cx)^2) = L(1+cx)^2$.\n\nThe total binding polynomial, or partition function $Q(x)$, is the sum of the weights of all possible microstates:\n$$Q(x) = Q_R(x) + Q_T(x) = (1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2.$$\nThis is the partition function over ligation microstates.\n\nThe average number of ligands bound per dimer, $\\bar{\\nu}$, is given by the standard statistical mechanical relation:\n$$\\bar{\\nu}(x) = \\frac{d\\ln Q(x)}{d\\ln x} = x \\frac{1}{Q(x)} \\frac{dQ(x)}{dx}.$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $Q(x)$:\n$$\\frac{dQ(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( (1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2 \\right) = 2(1+x) + L \\cdot 2(1+cx) \\cdot c = 2(1+x) + 2Lc(1+cx).$$\nSo, the average number of bound ligands is:\n$$\\bar{\\nu}(x) = x \\frac{2(1+x) + 2Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}.$$\nThe fractional site occupancy, $Y(x)$, is the average number of occupied sites divided by the total number of sites, which is $2$ for a dimer.\n$$Y(x) = \\frac{\\bar{\\nu}(x)}{2} = x \\frac{(1+x) + Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}.$$\nThis expression can be expanded as:\n$$Y(x) = \\frac{x(1+x+Lc+Lc^2x)}{(1+2x+x^2) + L(1+2cx+c^2x^2)} = \\frac{(1+Lc)x + (1+Lc^2)x^2}{(1+L) + 2(1+Lc)x + (1+Lc^2)x^2}.$$\n\nb) Parametric representation of the Scatchard plot and its curvature\n\nThe Scatchard plot graphs $Y(x)/x$ versus $Y(x)$. The parametric representation is the pair of functions $\\{Y(x), Y(x)/x\\}$, where $x$ is the parameter. From part (a), we have:\n$$Y(x) = x \\frac{(1+x) + Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{Y(x)}{x} = \\frac{(1+x) + Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}.$$\nThe qualitative curvature of the Scatchard plot (concave upward or downward) indicates the nature of the cooperativity. A concave-upward (\"humped\") plot, where $Y(x)/x$ first increases from its value at $x=0$, is a definitive sign of positive cooperativity. A monotonically decreasing plot (concave downward) signifies negative or no cooperativity. The behavior is determined by the sign of the derivative of $Y(x)/x$ at $x=0$.\nLet $f(x) = Y(x)/x$. We examine the sign of $f'(0)$.\nLet $N(x) = (1+x) + Lc(1+cx)$ and $D(x) = (1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2$. Then $f(x)=N(x)/D(x)$.\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{N'(x)D(x) - N(x)D'(x)}{D(x)^2}.$$\nAt $x=0$:\n$N(0) = 1+Lc$\n$D(0) = 1+L$\n$N'(x) = 1+Lc^2 \\implies N'(0) = 1+Lc^2$\n$D'(x) = 2(1+x) + 2Lc(1+cx) \\implies D'(0) = 2(1+Lc)$\nThe sign of $f'(0)$ is the sign of $N'(0)D(0) - N(0)D'(0)$:\n$$\\text{Sign}(f'(0)) = \\text{Sign}((1+Lc^2)(1+L) - (1+Lc) \\cdot 2(1+Lc)) = \\text{Sign}((1+Lc^2)(1+L) - 2(1+Lc)^2).$$\nThe Scatchard plot is concave upward (positive cooperativity) if this term is positive, and concave downward if it is negative.\nAs we will see in part (c), comparing macroscopic binding constants suggests that the second binding step is \"stronger\" than the first (after accounting for statistics) whenever $c \\neq 1$. However, this does not guarantee a concave-upward Scatchard plot. The condition $(1+Lc^2)(1+L) - 2(1+Lc)^2 > 0$ is a stricter condition, which must be met for the plot to be humped. For example, for $c=0$, the condition becomes $1+L-2 > 0$, or $L>1$. Thus, for exclusive binding to the $R$ state, the Scatchard plot is humped only if the protein is predominantly in the $T$ state in the absence of ligand ($L>1$).\n\nc) Mapping to the Adair scheme\n\nThe Adair scheme for a two-site protein describes binding in terms of macroscopic constants. Using the problem's definitions, the concentrations of species with $0$, $1$, and $2$ ligands are $[P_0]$, $[P_1] = [P_0]\\frac{x}{\\kappa_1}$, and $[P_2] = [P_1]\\frac{x}{\\kappa_2} = [P_0]\\frac{x^2}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}$. The corresponding binding polynomial is:\n$$Q_{Adair}(x) = [P_0]\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\kappa_1}x + \\frac{1}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}x^2\\right).$$\nFrom part (a), the MWC binding polynomial is:\n$$Q_{MWC}(x) = (1+L) + 2(1+Lc)x + (1+Lc^2)x^2.$$\nTo map MWC to Adair, we match the coefficients of the powers of $x$. We can set the constant term $[P_0]$ in the Adair polynomial to be $1+L$.\n$$Q_{MWC}(x) = (1+L)\\left(1 + \\frac{2(1+Lc)}{1+L}x + \\frac{1+Lc^2}{1+L}x^2\\right).$$\nComparing this with the Adair form, we identify:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\kappa_1} = \\frac{2(1+Lc)}{1+L} \\implies \\kappa_1 = \\frac{1+L}{2(1+Lc)}.$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2} = \\frac{1+Lc^2}{1+L} \\implies \\kappa_1\\kappa_2 = \\frac{1+L}{1+Lc^2}.$$\nNow we solve for $\\kappa_2$:\n$$\\kappa_2 = \\frac{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}{\\kappa_1} = \\frac{(1+L)/(1+Lc^2)}{(1+L)/(2(1+Lc))} = \\frac{2(1+Lc)}{1+Lc^2}.$$\n\nd) Hill slope at half-saturation and diagnosis of cooperativity\n\nThe Hill slope at half-saturation ($Y=1/2$) is $n_H = \\left.\\frac{d\\ln(Y/(1-Y))}{d\\ln x}\\right|_{Y=1/2}$.\nFirst, we find an expression for $\\theta(x) = Y/(1-Y)$.\nFrom part (a), $Y(x) = \\frac{\\bar{\\nu}(x)}{2} = \\frac{x((1+x) + Lc(1+cx))}{Q(x)}$.\nThen $1-Y(x) = \\frac{Q(x) - \\bar{\\nu}(x)/2}{Q(x)} = \\frac{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2 - x(1+x+Lc+Lc^2x)}{Q(x)}$.\nThe numerator simplifies to $1+x+L+Lcx = (1+x)+L(1+cx)$. So,\n$$\\theta(x) = \\frac{Y(x)}{1-Y(x)} = \\frac{x((1+x)+Lc(1+cx))}{(1+x)+L(1+cx)} = x \\frac{(1+Lc)+x(1+Lc^2)}{(1+L)+x(1+Lc)}.$$\nAt half-saturation, $Y(x_{1/2})=1/2$, which implies $\\theta(x_{1/2})=1$.\n$$x_{1/2} \\frac{(1+Lc)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2)}{(1+L)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc)} = 1.$$\n$$x_{1/2}(1+Lc)+x_{1/2}^2(1+Lc^2) = (1+L)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc).$$\n$$x_{1/2}^2(1+Lc^2) = 1+L \\implies x_{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+L}{1+Lc^2}}.$$\nNow we compute $n_H$.\n$$n_H = \\frac{d\\ln\\theta}{d\\ln x} = x \\frac{d\\ln\\theta}{dx} = x \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\ln x + \\ln((1+Lc)+x(1+Lc^2)) - \\ln((1+L)+x(1+Lc)) \\right].$$\n$$n_H = 1 + \\frac{x(1+Lc^2)}{(1+Lc)+x(1+Lc^2)} - \\frac{x(1+Lc)}{(1+L)+x(1+Lc)}.$$\nWe evaluate this at $x=x_{1/2}$. Note that at $x_{1/2}$, the denominator of the third term is $x_{1/2}$ times the numerator of the second term. Specifically, $x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+L}}{\\sqrt{1+Lc^2}}(1+Lc^2) = \\sqrt{(1+L)(1+Lc^2)}$ and $(1+L) = x_{1/2}^2(1+Lc^2)$.\nThe expression for $n_H$ becomes much simpler at $x_{1/2}$ where $(1+L)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc) = x_{1/2}((1+Lc)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2))$.\nSo, $n_H(x_{1/2}) = 1 + \\frac{x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2)}{A} - \\frac{x_{1/2}^2(1+Lc)}{x_{1/2}A}$ where $A=(1+Lc)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2)$.\n$$n_H = 1 + \\frac{x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2) - x_{1/2}(1+Lc)}{(1+Lc)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2)} = 1 + \\frac{x_{1/2}(Lc^2-Lc)}{(1+Lc)+x_{1/2}(1+Lc^2)}.$$\nUpon simplification, or using the relation $AB > 1+Lc$ derived earlier, a cleaner expression is found:\n$$n_H = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+Lc^2)}}{1+Lc+\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+Lc^2)}}.$$\nFor $c=1$, $n_H = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+L)}}{1+L+\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+L)}} = \\frac{2(1+L)}{2(1+L)}=1$. For no preference ($c=1$), there is no cooperativity.\nFor any $c \\ne 1$ and $L>0$, we can show that $n_H>1$. The condition $n_H>1$ is equivalent to $\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+Lc^2)} > 1+Lc$, which upon squaring and simplifying yields $L(c-1)^2 > 0$. This is true for $L>0, c \\ne 1$. Thus, the MWC model always predicts $n_H > 1$ (positive cooperativity) as long as the two states have different affinities for the ligand. The maximum value is $n_H=2$, achieved in the limit of exclusive binding ($c=0$ or $c \\to \\infty$) and a large allosteric constant $L$.\n\nThe cooperativity diagnostics are:\n1.  **Hill slope**: $n_H > 1$ indicates positive cooperativity. For MWC, this is true whenever $c \\neq 1$.\n2.  **Scatchard plot curvature**: Concave upward shape is a hallmark of positive cooperativity. This requires a stricter condition than $n_H>1$.\n3.  **Adair constants**: Apparent positive cooperativity, indicated by $\\kappa_2 < 4\\kappa_1$, is found whenever $c \\ne 1$, just like the Hill slope. The condition $\\kappa_2 < 4\\kappa_1$ is equivalent to $L(c-1)^2>0$.\n\nIn a KNF sequential model, cooperativity arises from direct interactions between adjacent subunits. This model can account for both positive cooperativity ($n_H>1$) and negative cooperativity ($n_H<1$), where binding of the first ligand makes the second binding event less favorable. In the simplest KNF models, the conditions for $n_H>1$ and a humped Scatchard plot are equivalent. The MWC model is structurally incapable of producing $n_H<1$, a key distinguishing feature. The discordance between the conditions for sigmoidicity ($n_H>1$) and a humped Scatchard plot is also a signature of the MWC concerted mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Y(x) = \\frac{x((1+x) + Lc(1+cx))}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}}$$", "id": "2656245"}, {"introduction": "Allostery is not merely a static, equilibrium property; it fundamentally shapes the dynamics of biological networks.

No unit conversion is required beyond consistent use of these units.\n- Final output format: your program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated Python-style list of booleans in the order of the test cases, for example, $\\texttt{[True,False,...]}$.\n\nTest suite (each tuple is $(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}, k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)}, k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)}, k_{\\mathrm{off}}, c)$ with units as specified above):\n\n- Case A (a general case where induced neighbors slow binding): $(1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,1.0,\\,1.0\\times 10^{-6})$.\n- Case B (boundary case with $k_{\\mathrm{off}}=0$ and $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} = \\tfrac{3}{2}\\,k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}$): $(1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,1.5\\times 10^{6},\\,2.0\\times 10^{6},\\,0.0,\\,1.0\\times 10^{-6})$.\n- Case C (high $c$ where induced neighbors accelerate binding and off-rate is small): $(1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,2.0\\times 10^{6},\\,2.0\\times 10^{6},\\,0.1,\\,1.0\\times 10^{-3})$.\n- Case D (low $c$ with the same $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)}$ as Case C, but off-rate dominates initially): $(1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,2.0\\times 10^{6},\\,2.0\\times 10^{6},\\,0.1,\\,1.0\\times 10^{-9})$.\n- Case E (very large $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ forces initial deceleration): $(1.0\\times 10^{5},\\,1.0\\times 10^{6},\\,5.0\\times 10^{5},\\,100.0,\\,1.0\\times 10^{-6})$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the test suite above, for example, $\\texttt{[result\\_A,result\\_B,result\\_C,result\\_D,result\\_E]}$.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a condition for transient negative cooperativity in a specific Koshland–Némethy–Filmer (KNF) model for a trimeric protein. Transient negative cooperativity is defined by the inequality $m''(0) < 0$, where $m(t)$ is the expected number of bound ligands at time $t$. The derivation must start from the chemical master equation.\n\nFirst, we define the state of the system by the number of bound ligands, $k$, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. Let $p_k(t)$ be the total probability of the system having $k$ subunits bound to ligand at time $t$. The initial condition is that all subunits are unbound, so we have $p_0(0) = 1$ and $p_k(0) = 0$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nWe must determine the transition rates between these states. The protein is a trimer in a ring, which implies that any two subunits are adjacent. Let $c$ be the ligand concentration.\n\n- **Transition from $k=0$ to $k=1$**:\nThere are $3$ identical unbound subunits. Each has $j=0$ induced neighbors. The rate for binding to any one of them is $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}c$. The total rate of transition is $3 \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}c$.\n\n- **Transitions from $k=1$**:\nThere is $1$ bound subunit and $2$ unbound subunits.\n- **Binding (to $k=2$)**: The $2$ unbound subunits are both neighbors of the single induced subunit. Thus, for each of them, $j=1$. The rate of binding to either one is $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)}c$. The total rate for a second binding event is $2 \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)}c$.\n- **Unbinding (to $k=0$)**: The single bound subunit unbinds with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\n- **Transitions from $k=2$**:\nThere are $2$ bound subunits and $1$ unbound subunit.\n- **Binding (to $k=3$)**: The single unbound subunit is a neighbor to both induced subunits, so it has $j=2$ induced neighbors. The rate of binding is $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)}c$.\n- **Unbinding (to $k=1$)**: There are $2$ bound subunits. Each can unbind with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The total rate for an unbinding event is $2 \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\n- **Transitions from $k=3$**:\nAll $3$ subunits are bound.\n- **Unbinding (to $k=2$)**: There are $3$ bound subunits. Each can unbind with rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The total rate for an unbinding event is $3 \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{off}}$.\n\nFrom these rates, we construct the chemical master equation, which is a system of ordinary differential equations for the probabilities $p_k(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_0}{dt} = -3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\, p_0 + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p_1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_1}{dt} = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\, p_0 - (2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) p_1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p_2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_2}{dt} = 2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c \\, p_1 - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}}) p_2 + 3 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p_3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_3}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c \\, p_2 - 3 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p_3\n$$\n\nThe expected number of bound ligands, $m(t)$, is defined as:\n$$\nm(t) = \\mathbb{E}[n(t)] = \\sum_{k=0}^{3} k \\, p_k(t) = p_1(t) + 2p_2(t) + 3p_3(t)\n$$\nWe need to compute the second derivative $m''(0)$. To do this, we first compute the derivatives of $p_k(t)$ at $t=0$. Let $p'_k(0)$ denote $\\frac{dp_k}{dt}|_{t=0}$. Using the initial conditions $p_0(0)=1$, $p_1(0)=0$, $p_2(0)=0$, $p_3(0)=0$ in the master equation:\n$$\np'_0(0) = -3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\cdot 1 + k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\cdot 0 = -3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c\n$$\n$$\np'_1(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\cdot 1 - (2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) \\cdot 0 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\cdot 0 = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c\n$$\n$$\np'_2(0) = 2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c \\cdot 0 - \\dots = 0\n$$\n$$\np'_3(0) = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c \\cdot 0 - \\dots = 0\n$$\n\nThe first derivative of $m(t)$ at $t=0$ is:\n$$\nm'(0) = p'_1(0) + 2p'_2(0) + 3p'_3(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c + 2(0) + 3(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c\n$$\nThis represents the initial rate of ligand binding.\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives, $p''_k(0) = \\frac{d^2p_k}{dt^2}|_{t=0}$. We differentiate the master equations with respect to $t$ and evaluate at $t=0$ using the values of $p'_k(0)$ we just found:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2p_1}{dt^2} = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\, p'_0(t) - (2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) p'_1(t) + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p'_2(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\implies p''_1(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\, p'_0(0) - (2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c + k_{\\mathrm{off}}) p'_1(0) + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p'_2(0)\n$$\n$$\np''_1(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c (-3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c) - (2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c + k_{\\mathrm{off}})(3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c) + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}}(0)\n$$\n$$\np''_1(0) = -9(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}c)^2 - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}c(2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)}c + k_{\\mathrm{off}})\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2p_2}{dt^2} = 2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c \\, p'_1(t) - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}}) p'_2(t) + 3 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p'_3(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\implies p''_2(0) = 2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c \\, p'_1(0) - (k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c + 2 k_{\\mathrm{off}}) p'_2(0) + 3 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p'_3(0)\n$$\n$$\np''_2(0) = 2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c (3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c) - 0 + 0 = 6 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2p_3}{dt^2} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c \\, p'_2(t) - 3 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p'_3(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\implies p''_3(0) = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)} c \\, p'_2(0) - 3 k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\, p'_3(0) = k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)}c(0) - 3k_{\\mathrm{off}}(0) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate $m''(0)$:\n$$\nm''(0) = p''_1(0) + 2p''_2(0) + 3p''_3(0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p''_k(0)$:\n$$\nm''(0) = \\left[-9(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}c)^2 - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}c(2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)}c + k_{\\mathrm{off}})\\right] + 2\\left[6 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c^2\\right] + 3[0]\n$$\n$$\nm''(0) = -9(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)})^2 c^2 - 6 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c^2 - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c k_{\\mathrm{off}} + 12 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c^2\n$$\nCombine terms:\n$$\nm''(0) = -9(k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)})^2 c^2 + 6 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c^2 - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c k_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nFactor out the common term $3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c$:\n$$\nm''(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\left[ -3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c + 2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} c - k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\right]\n$$\nThis leads to the final expression for $m''(0)$:\n$$\nm''(0) = 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} c \\left[ (2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)})c - k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem states that transient negative cooperativity corresponds to the condition $m''(0) < 0$. Since $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)} > 0$ and $c > 0$, the sign of $m''(0)$ is determined by the term in the brackets. The necessary and sufficient inequality is:\n$$\n(2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)})c - k_{\\mathrm{off}} < 0\n$$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$\nc(2 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(1)} - 3 k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(0)}) < k_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nThis is the derived condition. It is important to note that this condition is independent of the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}^{(2)}$, because this parameter only affects transitions from the doubly-bound state ($k=2$), and such states are not populated to a sufficient degree at infinitesimal time to contribute to the second derivative of the mean occupancy.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by evaluating the derived condition for transient\n    negative cooperativity for a set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite from the problem statement.\n    # Each tuple is (k_on_0, k_on_1, k_on_2, k_off, c).\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (1.0e6, 1.0e6, 1.0e6, 1.0, 1.0e-6),\n        # Case B\n        (1.0e6, 1.5e6, 2.0e6, 0.0, 1.0e-6),\n        # Case C\n        (1.0e6, 2.0e6, 2.0e6, 0.1, 1.0e-3),\n        # Case D\n        (1.0e6, 2.0e6, 2.0e6, 0.1, 1.0e-9),\n        # Case E\n        (1.0e5, 1.0e6, 5.0e5, 100.0, 1.0e-6),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        k_on_0, k_on_1, k_on_2, k_off, c = case\n        \n        # The condition for transient negative cooperativity (m''(0) < 0) is derived\n        # from first principles as:\n        # c * (2 * k_on^(1) - 3 * k_on^(0)) < k_off\n        #\n        # The parameter k_on_2 does not appear in the condition because it governs\n        # transitions from the k=2 state, which does not contribute to the\n        # second time derivative of the mean occupancy at t=0.\n        \n        is_negative_cooperativity = c * (2 * k_on_1 - 3 * k_on_0)  k_off\n        results.append(is_negative_cooperativity)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The expected output is [True, False, False, True, True]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(lambda x: 'True' if x else 'False', results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2656246"}]}
