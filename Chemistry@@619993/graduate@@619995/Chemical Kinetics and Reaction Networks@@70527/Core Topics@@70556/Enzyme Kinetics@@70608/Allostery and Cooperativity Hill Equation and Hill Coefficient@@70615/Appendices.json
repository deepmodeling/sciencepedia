A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Symbolic Expression\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the coupling free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}}$, using a thermodynamic cycle. This energy is defined as the change in the conformational free energy difference upon the binding of one ligand molecule.\n$\\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} - \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)}$\n\nHere, $\\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy difference between the tense ($T$) and relaxed ($R$) states in the absence of ligand ($m=0$), and $\\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)}$ is the same difference when one ligand molecule is bound ($m=1$).\n\nWe consider the following four states and the equilibria connecting them, forming a thermodynamic cycle:\n_1._ $R_0$: The receptor in the relaxed state, unliganded.\n_2._ $T_0$: The receptor in the tense state, unliganded.\n_3._ $R_1M$: The receptor in the relaxed state, bound to one ligand molecule $M$.\n_4._ $T_1M$: The receptor in the tense state, bound to one ligand molecule $M$.\n\nThe equilibria are characterized by the following standard free energy changes:\nThe conformational equilibrium in the absence of ligand is $R_0 \\rightleftharpoons T_0$. The equilibrium constant is defined as $L_0 = [T_0]/[R_0]$. The corresponding standard free energy change is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} = G^\\circ_{T_0} - G^\\circ_{R_0} = -RT \\ln(L_0) $$\n\nThe conformational equilibrium in the presence of one bound ligand is $R_1M \\rightleftharpoons T_1M$. We define its equilibrium constant as $L_1 = [T_1M]/[R_1M]$. The corresponding standard free energy change is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} = G^\\circ_{T_1M} - G^\\circ_{R_1M} = -RT \\ln(L_1) $$\n\nLigand binding to the $R$ state is described by $R_0 + M \\rightleftharpoons R_1M$. The dissociation constant is $K_R = \\frac{[R_0][M]}{[R_1M]}$. The standard free energy of binding is related to the association constant ($1/K_R$):\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},R} = G^\\circ_{R_1M} - G^\\circ_{R_0} - G^\\circ_{M} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_R}\\right) = RT \\ln(K_R) $$\n\nLigand binding to the $T$ state is described by $T_0 + M \\rightleftharpoons T_1M$. The dissociation constant is $K_T = \\frac{[T_0][M]}{[T_1M]}$. The standard free energy of binding is:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},T} = G^\\circ_{T_1M} - G^\\circ_{T_0} - G^\\circ_{M} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_T}\\right) = RT \\ln(K_T) $$\n\nSince Gibbs free energy is a state function, the total free energy change for a cyclic process is zero. We construct a cycle: $R_0 \\to T_0 \\to T_1M \\to R_1M \\to R_0$. Alternatively and more directly, we can state that the free energy change between two states is path-independent. Let us consider the transition from the state ($R_0 + M$) to $T_1M$ via two paths.\n\nPath 1: First, ligand binds to $R_0$. Second, the complex changes conformation.\n$R_0 + M \\to R_1M \\to T_1M$\nThe total free energy change is $\\Delta G_{\\text{path 1}} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},R} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)}$.\n\nPath 2: First, the receptor changes conformation. Second, ligand binds to $T_0$.\n$R_0 + M \\to T_0 + M \\to T_1M$\nThe total free energy change is $\\Delta G_{\\text{path 2}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},T}$.\n\nEquating the free energy changes of both paths:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},R} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},T} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for each term:\n$$ RT \\ln(K_R) + (-RT \\ln(L_1)) = (-RT \\ln(L_0)) + RT \\ln(K_T) $$\nDividing by $RT$:\n$$ \\ln(K_R) - \\ln(L_1) = -\\ln(L_0) + \\ln(K_T) $$\nRearranging to solve for $\\ln(L_1)$:\n$$ \\ln(L_1) = \\ln(L_0) + \\ln(K_R) - \\ln(K_T) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_0 K_R}{K_T}\\right) $$\nThis gives the relation $L_1 = L_0 \\frac{K_R}{K_T}$. Using the given definition $c = K_R/K_T$, we have $L_1 = c L_0$.\n\nNow we can derive the expression for the coupling free energy:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} - \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = (-RT \\ln(L_1)) - (-RT \\ln(L_0)) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT (\\ln(L_0) - \\ln(L_1)) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L_1}\\right) $$\nSubstitute $L_1 = L_0 (K_R/K_T)$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L_0 (K_R/K_T)}\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_R/K_T}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_T}{K_R}\\right) $$\nExpressed in terms of $c = K_R/K_T$, this is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right) = -RT \\ln(c) $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression. It correctly demonstrates that the coupling energy—the extent to which ligand binding modulates the conformational equilibrium—depends only on the ratio of the ligand's affinities for the two states, not on the intrinsic conformational equilibrium $L_0$ itself. The expression $\\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln(K_T/K_R)$ is in an appropriate form as requested.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $R = 8.314\\,462\\,618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $K_R = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_T = 10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $c$:\n$$ c = \\frac{K_R}{K_T} = \\frac{0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 0.010 $$\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $\\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = -RT \\ln(c) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = - (8.314\\,462\\,618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(0.010) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = - (2577.48341358\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (-4.605170186) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} \\approx 11869.60\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in biophysical chemistry, specifically concerning the statistical mechanics of ligand-receptor binding with cooperativity. All provided information is scientifically sound, self-contained, and sufficient for deriving a unique, analytical solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of a receptor macromolecule with $2$ identical but distinguishable binding sites for a ligand $L$. The state of the receptor can be described by the number of bound ligands. We define the reference state as the empty receptor, to which we assign a statistical weight of $1$.\n\nLet $[L]$ be the concentration of the ligand and $K$ be the intrinsic microscopic association constant for a ligand binding to a single, isolated site. The statistical weight of a state is proportional to the product of the Boltzmann factor for its energy and the concentration terms for the bound ligands.\n\nThe receptor can exist in three classes of states:\n$1$. The empty state (no ligands bound), denoted as state $0$. There is $1$ such microstate. We set its energy to $0$. Its statistical weight is $w_0 = 1$.\n\n$2$. The singly occupied state (one ligand bound), denoted as state $1$. Because the two binding sites are identical but distinguishable, there are $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways to form this state (ligand on site $A$ or on site $B$). The binding of one ligand contributes a factor of $K[L]$ to the statistical weight. Therefore, the total statistical weight for the singly occupied state is the sum of the weights of these two microstates: $w_1 = K[L] + K[L] = 2K[L]$.\n\n$3$. The doubly occupied state (two ligands bound), denoted as state $2$. There is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way to form this state. If the bindings were independent, the statistical weight would be $(K[L])^2$. However, the problem specifies an interaction energy penalty $\\epsilon  0$ for the doubly occupied state. This additional energy term modifies the statistical weight by a Boltzmann factor $\\alpha = \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon)$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. Thus, the statistical weight of the doubly occupied state is $w_2 = \\alpha (K[L])^2$.\n\nThe binding polynomial, $P([L])$, is the grand canonical partition function for the receptor.

Since $d \\ln L = d \\ln \\alpha$, we have:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{d \\ln \\left( (1+\\alpha)^N + L_0 \\right)}{d \\ln \\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha}{N((1+\\alpha)^N + L_0)} \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left( (1+\\alpha)^N + L_0 \\right)$$\n$$\\theta(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha}{N((1+\\alpha)^N + L_0)} \\left( N(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha(1+\\alpha)^{N-1}}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0}$$\nWe are given that at $\\theta = 1/2$, the free ligand concentration is $L^\\ast = 3 K_R$, which corresponds to $\\alpha = 3$. We use this condition to determine $L_0$ for $N=4$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3(1+3)^{4-1}}{(1+3)^4 + L_0} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4^3}{4^4 + L_0} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 64}{256 + L_0} = \\frac{192}{256 + L_0}$$\nSolving for $L_0$:\n$$256 + L_0 = 2 \\cdot 192 = 384 \\implies L_0 = 384 - 256 = 128$$\n\nNext, we calculate the true Hill coefficient, $n_H^{\\mathrm{true}}$, at $\\theta=1/2$. The Hill coefficient is defined by $n_H = \\frac{d \\ln Y}{d \\ln L}$, where $Y = \\theta/(1-\\theta)$. We first express $Y$ in terms of $\\alpha$:\n$$1-\\theta = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha(1+\\alpha)^{N-1}}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0} = \\frac{(1+\\alpha)^N - \\alpha(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} + L_0}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0} = \\frac{(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} [(1+\\alpha)-\\alpha] + L_0}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0} = \\frac{(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} + L_0}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0}$$\n$$Y = \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = \\frac{\\alpha(1+\\alpha)^{N-1}}{(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} + L_0}$$\nTo compute $n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{d \\ln Y}{d \\ln \\alpha}$, we differentiate $\\ln Y$:\n$$\\ln Y = \\ln \\alpha + (N-1)\\ln(1+\\alpha) - \\ln((1+\\alpha)^{N-1} + L_0)$$\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{d(\\ln Y)}{d(\\ln \\alpha)} = \\alpha \\frac{d(\\ln Y)}{d\\alpha} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{N-1}{1+\\alpha} - \\frac{(N-1)(1+\\alpha)^{N-2}}{(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} + L_0} \\right)$$\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} = 1 + \\frac{\\alpha(N-1)}{1+\\alpha} - \\frac{\\alpha(N-1)(1+\\alpha)^{N-2}}{(1+\\alpha)^{N-1} + L_0}$$\nEvaluating at $\\alpha=3$, $N=4$, and $L_0=128$:\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} = 1 + \\frac{3(3)}{1+3} - \\frac{3(3)(1+3)^{2}}{(1+3)^{3} + 128} = 1 + \\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{9 \\cdot 16}{64 + 128} = 1 + \\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{144}{192}$$\nSince $144/192 = 3/4$,\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} = 1 + \\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{6}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$$\n\nNow, we account for ligand depletion to find the apparent Hill coefficient, $n_H^{\\mathrm{app}}$. The experimentalist plots $\\ln Y$ against $\\ln L_T$ instead of $\\ln L$. The apparent Hill coefficient is therefore:\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{d \\ln Y}{d \\ln L_T} = \\frac{d \\ln Y}{d \\ln L} \\frac{d \\ln L}{d \\ln L_T} = n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} \\frac{d \\ln L}{d \\ln L_T}$$\nWe must compute the factor $\\frac{d \\ln L}{d \\ln L_T} = \\frac{L_T}{L} \\frac{dL}{dL_T}$. The mass conservation law is $L_T = L + N R_T \\theta(L)$. Differentiating with respect to $L$:\n$$\\frac{dL_T}{dL} = 1 + N R_T \\frac{d\\theta}{dL}$$\nTo find $\\frac{d\\theta}{dL}$, we use $\\frac{d\\theta}{dL} = \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha}\\frac{d\\alpha}{dL} = \\frac{1}{K_R} \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha}$. We compute $\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha}$ by differentiating $\\ln \\theta$:\n$$\\ln \\theta = \\ln \\alpha + (N-1)\\ln(1+\\alpha) - \\ln((1+\\alpha)^N + L_0)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{N-1}{1+\\alpha} - \\frac{N(1+\\alpha)^{N-1}}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0}$$\nAt $\\theta=1/2$, $\\alpha=3$, $N=4$, $L_0=128$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha} \\right|_{\\alpha=3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{4(1+3)^3}{(1+3)^4+128} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{4 \\cdot 64}{256+128} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{256}{384} \\right]$$\nSince $256/384 = 2/3$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha} \\right|_{\\alpha=3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{2}{3} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{9-4}{12} \\right] = \\frac{5}{24}$$\nSo, $\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dL} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = \\frac{1}{K_R} \\frac{5}{24}$. Now we find $\\frac{dL_T}{dL}$ at $\\theta=1/2$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dL_T}{dL} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = 1 + N R_T \\left( \\frac{1}{K_R} \\frac{5}{24} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{N R_T}{K_R} \\frac{5}{24}$$\nUsing the given values $N=4$, $R_T=150\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_R=100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dL_T}{dL} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = 1 + \\frac{4 \\cdot 150}{100} \\frac{5}{24} = 1 + 6 \\cdot \\frac{5}{24} = 1 + \\frac{30}{24} = 1 + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}$$\nTherefore, $\\left. \\frac{dL}{dL_T} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\nNext, we need the ratio $L_T/L$ at $\\theta=1/2$. At this point, $L = 3 K_R = 3(100\\,\\mathrm{nM}) = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$L_T = L + N R_T \\theta = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM} + (4)(150\\,\\mathrm{nM})(1/2) = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 300\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 600\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe ratio is $L_T/L = 600/300 = 2$. Now we can compute the scaling factor for the derivative:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d \\ln L}{d \\ln L_T} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = \\frac{L_T}{L} \\frac{dL}{dL_T} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\nThe apparent Hill coefficient is:\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{app}} = n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} \\cdot \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{40}{18} = \\frac{20}{9}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the bias $\\Delta n_H = n_H^{\\mathrm{app}} - n_H^{\\mathrm{true}}$:\n$$\\Delta n_H = \\frac{20}{9} - \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 20 - 9 \\cdot 5}{18} = \\frac{40 - 45}{18} = -\\frac{5}{18}$$\nThe ligand depletion causes the experimentalist to underestimate the true Hill coefficient. The final result for the bias is $-\\frac{5}{18}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{18}}$$", "id": "2626392"}]}
