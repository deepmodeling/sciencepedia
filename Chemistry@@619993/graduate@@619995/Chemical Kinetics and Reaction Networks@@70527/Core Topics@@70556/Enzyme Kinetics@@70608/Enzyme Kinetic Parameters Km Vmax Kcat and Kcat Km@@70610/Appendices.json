These values are not equal; they differ by a factor of $41$. The premise is false.

For variant $Y$, the catalytic efficiency $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is within a few percent of the association rate constant $k_{1}$.**\nFor variant $Y$, the catalytic efficiency is $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{1.025 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{M}} \\approx 1.951 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$.\nThe association rate constant is $k_{1} = 2.0 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$.\nTo compare them, we compute the ratio: $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}}{k_{1}} = \\frac{1.951 \\times 10^{8}}{2.0 \\times 10^{8}} \\approx 0.9755$.\nThis means the catalytic efficiency is $97.55\\%$ of the association rate constant.

For any enzyme obeying the above mechanism under the steady-state assumption, $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is always less than or equal to $K_{d}$.**\nThe derived expressions are $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}$ and $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}$.\nWe can write $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}} + \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}} = K_{d} + \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}$.\nSince rate constants cannot be negative ($k_{\\text{cat}} \\ge 0$, $k_{1} > 0$), the term $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}$ is always non-negative.\nTherefore, $K_{\\mathrm{M}} \\ge K_{d}$. The equality holds only in the hypothetical case where $k_{\\text{cat}} = 0$, meaning no catalysis occurs. For any active enzyme, $k_{\\text{cat}} > 0$, which implies $K_{\\mathrm{M}} > K_{d}$. The statement is the direct opposite of this fact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In the Briggs–Haldane steady-state interpretation, $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ can substantially exceed $K_{d}$ when catalytic turnover competes with dissociation, and increasing the ratio $k_{\\text{cat}}/k_{-1}$ at fixed $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ increases $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ without changing $K_{d}$.**\nThis statement consists of two parts.\nFirst part: \"$K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ can substantially exceed $K_{d}$ when catalytic turnover competes with dissociation\". This condition means $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is on the same order as or larger than $k_{-1}$. As shown by the relation $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = K_{d} + \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}$, a large $k_{\\text{cat}}$ leads to a large difference between $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ and $K_{d}$. Our analysis of variant $Y$ provides a concrete example of this, where $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = 41 \\times K_{d}$. This part is correct.\nSecond part: \"increasing the ratio $k_{\\text{cat}}/k_{-1}$ at fixed $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ increases $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ without changing $K_{d}$\". If $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ are fixed, increasing the ratio $k_{\\text{cat}}/k_{-1}$ requires increasing $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n- The effect on $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{1}}$: With $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ constant, increasing $k_{\\text{cat}}$ will increase the numerator, thus increasing $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$.\n- The effect on $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}$: This expression does not contain $k_{\\text{cat}}$. With $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$ fixed, $K_d$ remains constant.\nBoth parts of the statement are a correct description of the properties of the Briggs-Haldane model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2640946"}, {"introduction": "While $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ are informative, a more powerful metric for an enzyme's overall effectiveness is the specificity constant, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, which governs the reaction rate at low substrate concentrations.

Substituting this into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$\nk_{1}([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]\n$$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_T[S] - k_{1}[ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES]\n$$\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_T[S] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[ES] + k_{1}[ES][S]\n$$\n$$\nk_{1}[E]_T[S] = [ES](k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}[S])\n$$\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_{1}[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}[S]}\n$$\nThe initial velocity of the reaction, $v_0$, is the rate of product formation, which is given by:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[ES]\n$$\nSubstituting the steady-state expression for $[ES]$ into the equation for $v_0$ gives the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{k_{2}k_{1}[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{2} + k_{1}[S]}\n$$\nTo identify the Michaelis constant, $K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, we rearrange this expression into the standard form $v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{\\mathrm{M}} + [S]}$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $k_{1}$:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{k_{2}[E]_T[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}} + [S]}\n$$\nBy inspection, we identify $k_{\\text{cat}} = k_{2}$ and $K_{\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}}$.\n\nThe problem requests an expression for the specificity constant, $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}}$, defined as the proportionality constant between $v_0$ and the product $[E]_T[S]$ in the low-substrate limit ($[S] \\rightarrow 0$). In this limit, the term $k_{1}[S]$ in the denominator of the full rate law becomes negligible compared to $k_{-1} + k_{2}$. The rate law simplifies to:\n$$\nv_0 \\approx \\frac{k_{2}k_{1}[E]_T[S]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} = \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right)[E]_T[S]\n$$\nBy comparing this to the definition $v_0 = (k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})[E]_T[S]$, we derive the expression for the specificity constant:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction between the enzyme and substrate at low substrate concentrations.\n\nNext, we must compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(k_{\\text{cat}}/K_{\\mathrm{M}})}{k_{\\text{diff}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{diff}}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right)\n$$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$k_{1} = 2.4 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{-1} = 4.0 \\times 10^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{2} = 1.2 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{diff}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum in the denominator of the specificity constant:\n$$\nk_{-1} + k_2 = 4.0 \\times 10^{2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1} + 1.2 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 400 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} + 1200 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 1600 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 1.6 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we compute the specificity constant:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_{\\mathrm{M}}} = \\frac{(2.4 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1})(1.2 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\text{s}^{-1})}{1.6 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2.88 \\times 10^{11} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-2}}{1.6 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 1.8 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{8.0 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.8}{8.0} = 0.225\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.225$ already has exactly three significant figures. No further rounding is necessary.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.225}\n$$", "id": "2640949"}]}
