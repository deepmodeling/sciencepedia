The procedure is bifurcated into two phases: first, the calibration of a linear-in-features model using provided Density Functional Theory (DFT) data, and second, the prediction of rate constants for a new set of conditions using the calibrated model and Transition State Theory (TST).\n\nFirst, we formalize the modeling task. The activation Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$, is assumed to be an affine linear function of the reaction enthalpy, $\\Delta H$, and a site descriptor, $\\phi$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\ddagger_\\text{pred}(\\Delta H, \\phi) = \\beta_H \\Delta H + \\beta_\\phi \\phi + \\beta_0\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_H$ is the BEP coefficient (dimensionless), $\\beta_\\phi$ is the coefficient for the site descriptor (units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,eV^{-1}}$), and $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$). These coefficients are unknown and must be determined from the calibration data.\n\nThe calibration is performed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed activation energies, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_\\text{obs}$, and the model's predictions, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_\\text{pred}$. This can be formulated in matrix algebra as finding the coefficient vector $\\beta$ that minimizes the squared Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $\\| Y - X\\beta \\|_2^2$. The system is defined by:\n$$\nY = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta G^\\ddagger_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\Delta G^\\ddagger_N \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nX = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\Delta H_1 & \\phi_1 & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\Delta H_N & \\phi_N & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_H \\\\ \\beta_\\phi \\\\ \\beta_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $N=5$ is the number of data points in the calibration set.\n\nThe provided calibration data are:\n- $(\\Delta H, \\phi, \\Delta G^\\ddagger) = (\\,-50\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}, -1.8\\,\\mathrm{eV}, 79.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\\,)$\n- $(\\,-20\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}, -1.2\\,\\mathrm{eV}, 87.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\\,)$\n- $(\\,0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}, -0.8\\,\\mathrm{eV}, 92.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\\,)$\n- $(\\,30\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}, -1.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}, 119.0\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\\,)$\n- $(\\,60\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}, -0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}, 120.5\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\\,)$\n\nFrom this data, we construct the design matrix $X$ and the observation vector $Y$:\n$$\nX = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-50 & -1.8 & 1 \\\\\n-20 & -1.2 & 1 \\\\\n0   & -0.8 & 1 \\\\\n30  & -1.5 & 1 \\\\\n60  & -0.5 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nY = \\begin{pmatrix}\n79.5 \\\\\n87.0 \\\\\n92.0 \\\\\n119.0 \\\\\n120.5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe OLS solution for the coefficient vector $\\hat{\\beta}$ is given by the normal equations:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y\n$$\nA computational program will solve this system to find the numerical values for $\\hat{\\beta}_H$, $\\hat{\\beta}_\\phi$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$.\n\nSecond, we use the calibrated model to make predictions. For each test case $(\\Delta H_i, \\phi_i, T_i)$, we first compute the predicted activation energy:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\ddagger_i = \\hat{\\beta}_H \\Delta H_i + \\hat{\\beta}_\\phi \\phi_i + \\hat{\\beta}_0\n$$\nThe resulting $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_i$ will be in units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. For use in the TST expression, it must be converted to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ by multiplication by $1000$.\n\nThe unimolecular TST rate constant, $k(T)$, is then computed using the formula:\n$$\nk(T_i) = \\frac{k_\\mathrm{B} T_i}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_i}{R T_i}\\right)\n$$\nThe physical constants are provided as:\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_\\mathrm{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n- Molar gas constant, $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nThe final program will execute these steps for the four specified test cases, and the resulting rate constants will be rounded to six significant figures and formatted as a comma-separated list.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fits a linear BEP-consistent scaling model and computes TST rate constants.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calibration dataset from Density Functional Theory (DFT)\n    # Each entry is a triplet (delta_H [kJ/mol], phi [eV], delta_G_ddagger [kJ/mol])\n    calibration_data = [\n        (-50, -1.8, 79.5),\n        (-20, -1.2, 87.0),\n        (0, -0.8, 92.0),\n        (30, -1.5, 119.0),\n        (60, -0.5, 120.5),\n    ]\n\n    # Unpack data into separate arrays\n    delta_H_cal = np.array([d[0] for d in calibration_data])\n    phi_cal = np.array([d[1] for d in calibration_data])\n    delta_G_obs = np.array([d[2] for d in calibration_data])\n\n    # Construct the design matrix X for the linear model:\n    # delta_G_ddagger = beta_H * delta_H + beta_phi * phi + beta_0\n    # The columns correspond to delta_H, phi, and the intercept.\n    X = np.vstack([delta_H_cal, phi_cal, np.ones(len(delta_H_cal))]).T\n\n    # Solve the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) problem Y = X * beta\n    # to find the coefficient vector beta = [beta_H, beta_phi, beta_0]\n    # np.linalg.lstsq is a robust method for this.\n    beta, residuals, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(X, delta_G_obs, rcond=None)\n    beta_H, beta_phi, beta_0 = beta\n\n    # Define the prediction function using the calibrated coefficients\n    def predict_delta_G_ddagger(delta_H, phi):\n        \"\"\"Predicts activation free energy in kJ/mol.\"\"\"\n        return beta_H * delta_H + beta_phi * phi + beta_0\n\n    # Physical constants for the TST rate expression\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant, J/K\n    h = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck's constant, J*s\n    R = 8.314462618      # Molar gas constant, J/mol/K\n    \n    # Test cases for prediction\n    # Each entry is a triplet (delta_H [kJ/mol], phi [eV], T [K])\n    test_cases = [\n        (-80, -1.0, 500),\n        (10, -1.3, 700),\n        (90, -0.6, 900),\n        (0, -1.1, 600)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta_H_test, phi_test, T_test = case\n        \n        # 1.
