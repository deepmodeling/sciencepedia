Thus, $q(-a, y) = 0$ for all $y$.\n    \\item On the boundary of the product set $B$, the trajectory has reached $B$, so the probability of reaching $B$ first is $1$.

Since our solution is independent of $y_0$, this value is constant for all points on this surface.

The surface $x=0$ is stated to have an index-$1$ saddle of $V(x)$, which means the full potential $U(x,y)$ has a saddle point at $(0,0)$. In the deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics, this saddle corresponds to a Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold (NHIM). The NHIM is a structure in phase space that governs the reactive dynamics. Its stable and unstable manifolds divide the phase space into regions of reactive and non-reactive trajectories. The configuration-space projection of the NHIM is the surface $x=0$.\nThe committor provides a rigorous, probabilistic definition of the transition state. The true transition state surface is defined as the isocommittor surface $q=1/2$, the locus of points from which a trajectory has an equal probability of proceeding to the product state or returning to the reactant state. Our calculation shows that, for this symmetric potential and symmetric boundary conditions, the surface $x=0$ is precisely the $q=1/2$ isocommittor. This confirms that the geometrically-defined dividing surface $x=0$ is also the dynamically-defined transition state. The reason the committor is constant along the $y$-direction on this surface is that the dynamics along the reaction coordinate $x$ are decoupled from the confining dynamics in the $y$ coordinate. A trajectory at $(0,y)$ is at the peak of the potential barrier in $x$; its fate is determined by the next random fluctuation from the thermal bath. Due to the symmetry of the system, a kick in the $+x$ direction is as probable as a kick in the $-x$ direction, leading to a $50\\%$ chance of reaching either $B$ or $A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2689082"}, {"introduction": "A core assumption of simple Transition State Theory (TST) is that trajectories crossing the dividing surface proceed directly to products without returning.

A positive kinetic energy means the particle's velocity never becomes zero, and thus it can never turn around and recross the dividing surface at $x=a$ from the product side.\nConsequently, every trajectory that crosses the dividing surface at $x=a$ with a positive velocity is a reactive trajectory. It commits to products without returning.\nThis means that the set of velocities contributing to the reactive flux is identical to the set of velocities contributing to the total positive flux, namely all $v>0$.\nTherefore, the reactive flux is equal to the total positive flux:\n$$ J_{\\text{reactive}}^{+}(a) = J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(a) = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{1}{2} m v^2\\right) dv $$\nThe transmission coefficient $\\kappa(a)$ is their ratio:\n$$ \\kappa(a) = \\frac{J_{\\text{reactive}}^{+}(a)}{J_{\\text{total}}^{+}(a)} = 1 $$\nThis is the ideal value for a transmission coefficient, indicating that the dividing surface at $x=a$ is the optimal choice for this model, as it eliminates all recrossing events.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, specifically Transition State Theory (TST). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants, parameters, and functional forms. The language is objective and unambiguous. It is a standard, solvable problem in physical chemistry that is neither trivial nor ill-posed.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, the analytical derivation of the required thermodynamic quantities, and second, the description of the numerical procedure to compute the requested metrics.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for the temperature-dependent activation enthalpy $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)$ and activation entropy $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T)$. The change in heat capacity between the activated complex and the reactants is given by a polynomial in temperature, $T$.\nLet $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T) = C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T) - C_{p}^{\\mathrm{R}}(T)$. Given the polynomial form $C_{p}(T) = a + bT + cT^2$, the difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T) = (a^{\\ddagger} - a^{\\mathrm{R}}) + (b^{\\ddagger} - b^{\\mathrm{R}})T + (c^{\\ddagger} - c^{\\mathrm{R}})T^2 = \\Delta a + \\Delta b T + \\Delta c T^2\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta a$, $\\Delta b$, and $\\Delta c$ are the differences in the respective polynomial coefficients.\n\nThe activation enthalpy at a temperature $T$, $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)$, is found by integrating $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T)$ from a reference temperature $T_{0}$ to $T$:\n$$\n\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T_{0}) + \\int_{T_{0}}^{T} \\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T')\\, dT'\n$$\nSubstituting the polynomial for $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T')$ and performing the definite integration yields:\n$$\n\\int_{T_{0}}^{T} (\\Delta a + \\Delta b T' + \\Delta c T'^2)\\, dT' = \\left[ \\Delta a T' + \\frac{\\Delta b}{2} T'^2 + \\frac{\\Delta c}{3} T'^3 \\right]_{T_{0}}^{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T_{0}) + \\Delta a (T - T_0) + \\frac{\\Delta b}{2} (T^2 - T_0^2) + \\frac{\\Delta c}{3} (T^3 - T_0^3)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the activation entropy $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T)$ is found by integrating $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T)/T$:\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T) = \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T_{0}) + \\int_{T_{0}}^{T} \\frac{\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T')}{T'}\\, dT'\n$$\nThe integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{T_{0}}^{T} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta a}{T'} + \\Delta b + \\Delta c T'\\right)\\, dT' = \\left[ \\Delta a \\ln(T') + \\Delta b T' + \\frac{\\Delta c}{2} T'^2 \\right]_{T_{0}}^{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T) = \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T_{0}) + \\Delta a \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right) + \\Delta b (T - T_0) + \\frac{\\Delta c}{2} (T^2 - T_0^2)\n$$\nHere, $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm.\n\nNext, we formulate the Eyring plot ordinate, $y(T) = \\ln(k(T)/T)$. The Eyring equation relates the rate constant $k(T)$ to the activation Gibbs free energy, which is composed of the enthalpy and entropy contributions.\n$$\nk(T) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T)}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. Dividing by $T$ and taking the natural logarithm gives the ordinate $y(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{k(T)}{T} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T)}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ny(T) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k(T)}{T}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}{h}\\right) + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T)}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)}{RT}\n$$\nThe abscissa of the plot is $x(T) = 1/T$. By substituting the derived expressions for $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)$ and $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T)$ into the equation for $y(T)$, we obtain a non-linear function of $x(T)$ whenever $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}(T) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe numerical procedure for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. For each temperature $T_i$ in the provided grid, compute the corresponding abscissa $x_i = 1/T_i$.\n$2$. Using the derived expressions, compute the values of $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T_i)$ and $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}(T_i)$.\n$3$. Compute the ordinate values $y_i = y(T_i)$.\n$4$. Perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression on the points $(x_i, y_i)$ to find the best-fit line $y_{fit} = m x + c$. The coefficients $m$ (slope) and $c$ (intercept) are determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.\n$5$. Calculate the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the computed data $y_i$ and the fitted values $y_{fit,i} = m x_i + c$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - y_{fit,i})^2}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of points in the temperature grid. This value is dimensionless.\n$6$. Estimate the local curvature of the Eyring plot, $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$, at the central temperature of the grid. We use a $3$-point finite-difference formula suitable for non-uniformly spaced points. For three points $(x_a, y_a)$, $(x_b, y_b)$, and $(x_c, y_c)$, the second derivative at the central point $x_b$ is approximated by:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{x_b} \\approx 2 \\left( \\frac{y_a}{(x_b - x_a)(x_c - x_a)} - \\frac{y_b}{(x_b - x_a)(x_c - x_b)} + \\frac{y_c}{(x_c - x_b)(x_c - x_a)} \\right)\n$$\nFor our calculation, we select the three central points from the $5$-point grid. The units of this curvature are $\\mathrm{K^2}$, as $y$ is dimensionless and $x$ is in $\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$.\n\nThe implementation will use the provided physical constants: $R = 8.31446261815324\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$, and $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all specified test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define physical constants as per the problem statement.\n    R = 8.31446261815324  # J mol^-1 K^-1\n    kB = 1.380649e-23     # J K^-1\n    h = 6.62607015e-34     # J s\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"T0\": 298.15,\n            \"dH0\": 75000.0,\n            \"dS0\": -50.0,\n            \"coeffs_ts\": (120.0, 0.20, 0.0),\n            \"coeffs_r\": (60.0, 0.20, 0.0),\n            \"T_grid\": [280.0, 300.0, 320.0, 340.0, 360.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T0\": 298.15,\n            \"dH0\": 65000.0,\n            \"dS0\": -10.0,\n            \"coeffs_ts\": (95.0, 0.10, 1.0e-4),\n            \"coeffs_r\": (95.0, 0.10, 1.0e-4),\n            \"T_grid\": [280.0, 300.0, 320.0, 340.0, 360.0]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T0\": 298.15,\n            \"dH0\": 90000.0,\n            \"dS0\": -80.0,\n            \"coeffs_ts\": (80.0, 0.05, 1.0e-4),\n            \"coeffs_r\": (140.0, 0.05, 2.0e-4),\n            \"T_grid\": [280.0, 300.0, 320.0, 340.0, 360.0]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def process_case(case_data):\n        \"\"\"\n        Processes a single test case to calculate RMSD and curvature.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Unpack case data\n        T0 = case_data[\"T0\"]\n        dH0 = case_data[\"dH0\"]\n        dS0 = case_data[\"dS0\"]\n        coeffs_ts = case_data[\"coeffs_ts\"]\n        coeffs_r = case_data[\"coeffs_r\"]\n        T_grid = np.array(case_data[\"T_grid\"])\n        \n        # Calculate differences in heat capacity coefficients\n        da = coeffs_ts[0] - coeffs_r[0]\n        db = coeffs_ts[1] - coeffs_r[1]\n        dc = coeffs_ts[2] - coeffs_r[2]\n        \n        # Calculate temperature-dependent activation parameters\n        T = T_grid\n        dH_T = dH0 + da * (T - T0) + (db / 2.0) * (T**2 - T0**2) + (dc / 3.0) * (T**3 - T0**3)\n        # Use np.log for natural logarithm\n        # Add a small epsilon to T/T0 to avoid log(1) being not exactly 0 due to float issues\n        # although for centered T0 it won't matter.
