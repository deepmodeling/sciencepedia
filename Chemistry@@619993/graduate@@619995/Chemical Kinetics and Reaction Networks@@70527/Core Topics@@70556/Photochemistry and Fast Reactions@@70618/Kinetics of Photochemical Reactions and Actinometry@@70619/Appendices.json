The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the intrinsic internal conversion quantum yield from the first excited singlet state, S1, denoted as $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0}$. The fundamental principle of kinetic partitioning dictates that for the unquenched molecule, the sum of the quantum yields of all competing deactivation pathways from the S1 state must equal unity. The pathways are fluorescence (F), internal conversion (IC), and intersystem crossing (ISC, which leads to triplet state T1 formation). Therefore, the governing relationship is:\n$$ \\Phi_{F}^{0} + \\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0} + \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ISC}}^{0} = 1 $$\nThe problem provides the triplet formation yield, which is equivalent to the intersystem crossing yield, $\\Phi_{T}^{0} = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ISC}}^{0} = 0.620$. To find $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0}$, we must first determine the intrinsic fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_{F}^{0}$, in the absence of the quencher $Q$.\n\nFirst, we correct the observed, quenched fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_{F}(\\mathrm{obs})$, to obtain the intrinsic, unquenched value, $\\Phi_{F}^{0}$. The Stern-Volmer equation describes the relationship between the quantum yields in the absence and presence of a dynamic quencher:\n$$ \\frac{\\Phi_{F}^{0}}{\\Phi_{F}([Q])} = 1 + K_{\\mathrm{SV}}[Q] $$\nHere, $\\Phi_{F}([Q])$ is the fluorescence quantum yield at quencher concentration $[Q]$, which is the observed value $\\Phi_{F}(\\mathrm{obs}) = 0.120$. We are given $K_{\\mathrm{SV}} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$ and $[Q] = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{M}$. We can now solve for $\\Phi_{F}^{0}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{F}^{0} = \\Phi_{F}([Q]) \\times (1 + K_{\\mathrm{SV}}[Q]) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Phi_{F}^{0} = 0.120 \\times (1 + (3.0\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1})(0.050\\ \\mathrm{M})) $$\n$$ \\Phi_{F}^{0} = 0.120 \\times (1 + 0.15) $$\n$$ \\Phi_{F}^{0} = 0.120 \\times 1.15 = 0.138 $$\nThis is the intrinsic fluorescence quantum yield.\n\nNext, as an intermediate step required by the prompt, we verify the consistency of the data related to the deactivation of the T1 state. The problem states that from T1, the molecule can undergo phosphorescence, nonradiative deactivation to the ground state (S0), and a photochemical reaction to form product $P$. The total population of T1 states formed is given by the quantum yield $\\Phi_{T}^{0}$. The quantum yields of processes originating from T1 (phosphorescence, $\\Phi_{P}$, and product formation, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{prod}}$) are fractions of the total initially excited population, not the T1 population. They are related to the T1 branching fractions ($\\phi_{p}$ for phosphorescence, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$ for reaction) by $\\Phi_{P} = \\Phi_{T}^{0}\\phi_{p}$ and $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{prod}} = \\Phi_{T}^{0}\\phi_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$. The sum of all branching fractions from T1 must be unity: $\\phi_{p} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{rxn}} + \\phi_{nr, T1 \\to S0} = 1$. The consistency check is to ensure that the sum of the quantum yields of the known T1 processes does not exceed the total T1 formation yield.\nWe are given $\\Phi_{P} = 0.090$ and $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{prod}} = 0.080$. The sum is:\n$$ \\Phi_{P} + \\Phi_{\\mathrm{prod}} = 0.090 + 0.080 = 0.170 $$\nThis sum must be less than or equal to the total triplet formation yield, $\\Phi_{T}^{0} = 0.620$. Since $0.170  0.620$, the data are consistent. The remaining portion of the triplet population, with an overall quantum yield of $\\Phi_{T}^{0} - (\\Phi_{P} + \\Phi_{\\mathrm{prod}}) = 0.620 - 0.170 = 0.450$, must deactivate via the third pathway, non-radiative decay from T1 to S0. The verification is thus complete.\n\nFinally, we calculate the intrinsic S1 internal conversion quantum yield, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0}$. We return to the sum of quantum yields for S1 deactivation:\n$$ \\Phi_{F}^{0} + \\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0} + \\Phi_{T}^{0} = 1 $$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{IC}}^{0} = 1 - \\Phi_{F}^{0} - \\Phi_{T}^{0} $$\nWe have determined $\\Phi_{F}^{0} = 0.138$ and we are given $\\Phi_{T}^{0} = 0.620$.

The constants $A$, $I_{0}$, and $\\Phi_{0}$ do not affect the position of the maximum, so we need only maximize the function $f(C) = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\varepsilon C L)}{1 + K C}$.\n\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dC}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u(C) = 1 - \\exp(-\\varepsilon C L)$ and $v(C) = 1 + K C$:\n$u'(C) = \\varepsilon L \\exp(-\\varepsilon C L)$\n$v'(C) = K$\n\nSetting the numerator of the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{d f(C)}{dC} \\bigg|_{C=C^*} = 0 \\implies u'(C^*)v(C^*) - u(C^*)v'(C^*) = 0$$\n$$\\left(\\varepsilon L \\exp(-\\varepsilon C^* L)\\right)(1 + K C^*) - \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\varepsilon C^* L)\\right)K = 0$$\nExpand and rearrange the terms:\n$$\\varepsilon L \\exp(-\\varepsilon C^* L) + \\varepsilon L K C^* \\exp(-\\varepsilon C^* L) - K + K \\exp(-\\varepsilon C^* L) = 0$$\n$$(\\varepsilon L + K + \\varepsilon L K C^*) \\exp(-\\varepsilon C^* L) = K$$\n$$K + \\varepsilon L + \\varepsilon L K C^* = K \\exp(\\varepsilon C^* L)$$\nDivide by $K$ (which is a positive constant):\n$$1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K} + \\varepsilon L C^* = \\exp(\\varepsilon C^* L)$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $C^*$. To solve for $C^*$, we rearrange it into a form compatible with the Lambert $W$ function, which is defined by $w \\exp(w) = z \\iff w = W(z)$.\nLet $y = \\varepsilon L C^*$ and $b = \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}$. The equation becomes:\n$$1 + b + y = \\exp(y)$$\nRearranging gives $\\exp(y) - y = 1+b$. Let's manipulate this to the form $w \\exp(w)=z$.\nWe can write this as $-(y+1+b) = - \\exp(y)$. This does not immediately lead to the desired form.\nA correct approach to solve $\\exp(y) - y = c$ for $y$ is to rearrange as follows:\n$e^y = y+c \\implies 1 = (y+c)e^{-y} \\implies e^{-c} = (y+c)e^{-y}e^{-c} = (y+c)e^{-(y+c)}$.\nLet $v = -(y+c)$. Then $v e^v = -e^{-c}$. The solution is $v = W(-e^{-c})$.\nSubstituting back, $-(y+c) = W(-e^{-c})$, which gives $y = -W(-e^{-c}) - c$.\nIn our case, $c = 1+b = 1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}$.\nSo, $y^* = -W\\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\left(1+\\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}\\right)\\right)\\right) - \\left(1+\\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}\\right)$.\nThe argument of the Lambert $W$ function is in the interval $(-1/e, 0)$ because $1+b > 1$. This means there are two real branches for the solution: the principal branch $W_0$ and the secondary branch $W_{-1}$.\nThe equation $\\exp(y)-y = 1+b$ has two real roots for $y$, one positive and one negative, because the minimum of $\\exp(y)-y$ is 1 at $y=0$. Since we are looking for a physical concentration $C^* > 0$, we require $y^* = \\varepsilon L C^* > 0$.\nThe solution using the principal branch $W_0$ is negative:\n$y_0 = -W_0\\left(-\\exp\\left(-(1+b)\\right)\\right) - (1+b)$. As $W_0(x) \\in [-1, 0)$ for $x \\in [-1/e, 0)$, $-W_0(\\dots) \\in (0, 1]$. Since $1+b>1$, $y_0$ is negative. This is the non-physical root.\nThe solution using the branch $W_{-1}$ is:\n$y^* = -W_{-1}\\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\left(1+b\\right)\\right)\\right) - (1+b)$. As $W_{-1}(x) \\le -1$ for $x \\in [-1/e, 0)$, this root is positive and corresponds to the physical solution.\nTherefore, the optimal value is given by the $W_{-1}$ branch.\nSubstituting back $y^* = \\varepsilon L C^*$ and $b = \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}$:\n$$\\varepsilon L C^* = -W_{-1}\\left(-\\exp\\left(-1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}\\right)\\right) - 1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}$$\nFinally, solving for $C^*$:\n$$C^* = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon L} \\left[ -W_{-1}\\left(-\\exp\\left(-1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}\\right)\\right) - 1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K} \\right]$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the optimal concentration $C^*$ in terms of the given parameters $\\varepsilon$, $L$, and $K$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon L} \\left[ -W_{-1}\\left(-\\exp\\left(-1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K}\\right)\\right) - 1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon L}{K} \\right]}$$", "id": "2651263"}]}
