In contrast, dynamic (collisional) quenching shortens the measured lifetime and obeys the above lifetime Stern–Volmer relation.

Derivation of the Static Quenching Equation**\n\nThe steady-state fluorescence intensity, $I$, is proportional to the concentration of the species that can be excited and subsequently emit light. The problem states that only uncomplexed fluorophore, $F$, contributes to fluorescence, and the ground-state complex, $FQ$, is non-emissive. The excitation rate is constant. Therefore, the observed fluorescence intensity is proportional to the concentration of free fluorophore, $[F]$.\nLet $c$ be the proportionality constant that incorporates factors such as excitation intensity and instrument geometry.\nThen, the intensity in the presence of the quencher is:\n$$ I = c [F] $$\nIn the absence of the quencher ($[Q] = 0$), no complex $FQ$ is formed. Thus, the concentration of free fluorophore is equal to the total fluorophore concentration, $[F]_{\\text{tot}}$. The corresponding fluorescence intensity is $I_0$:\n$$ I_0 = c [F]_{\\text{tot}} $$\nThe ratio of the unquenched to quenched intensities is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{c [F]_{\\text{tot}}}{c [F]} = \\frac{[F]_{\\text{tot}}}{[F]} $$\nThe system is governed by two further conditions stated in the problem:\n(i) Conservation of total fluorophore concentration:\n$$ [F]_{\\text{tot}} = [F] + [FQ] $$\n(ii) Ground-state association equilibrium:\n$$ F + Q \\rightleftharpoons FQ $$\nThe equilibrium constant for this association, $K_S$, is given by the mass-action law:\n$$ K_S = \\frac{[FQ]}{[F][Q]} $$\nFrom the equilibrium expression, we can write the concentration of the complex as:\n$$ [FQ] = K_S [F] [Q] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[FQ]$ into the mass conservation equation yields:\n$$ [F]_{\\text{tot}} = [F] + K_S [F] [Q] $$\nFactoring out $[F]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$ [F]_{\\text{tot}} = [F] (1 + K_S [Q]) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[F]_{\\text{tot}}$ into our equation for the intensity ratio:\n$$ \\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{[F] (1 + K_S [Q])}{[F]} $$\nThis simplifies to the final linear relationship for static quenching:\n$$ \\frac{I_0}{I} = 1 + K_S [Q] $$\nThis equation is of the form $y = mx + c$, where $y = I_0/I$, $x = [Q]$, the y-intercept is $c=1$, and the slope is $m = K_S$. The derived equation shows that the plot of $I_0/I$ versus $[Q]$ is linear, with the slope being the ground-state association constant, $K_S$.\n\n**2. Determination of $K_S$ from the Data**\n\nThe derived relation, $\\frac{I_0}{I} = 1 + K_S [Q]$, indicates that $K_S$ can be determined from the slope of a plot of $\\frac{I_0}{I}$ versus $[Q]$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the slope, $K_S$:\n$$ K_S = \\frac{(I_0/I) - 1}{[Q]} $$\nWe will analyze the provided dataset. The first data point $([Q]=0, I_0/I=1.000)$ confirms the y-intercept is $1$, as predicted by the model. We can compute the slope for the other data points:\n- For $[Q] = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}$: $K_S = \\frac{1.250 - 1.000}{2.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.250}{0.002} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$\n- For $[Q] = 5.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}$: $K_S = \\frac{1.625 - 1.000}{5.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.625}{0.005} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$\n- For $[Q] = 8.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}$: $K_S = \\frac{2.000 - 1.000}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1.000}{0.008} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$\n- For $[Q] = 1.20 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{M}$: $K_S = \\frac{2.500 - 1.000}{1.20 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{1.500}{0.012} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$\n- For $[Q] = 1.60 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{M}$: $K_S = \\frac{3.000 - 1.000}{1.60 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{2.000}{0.016} = 125 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$\n\nThe data perfectly fit a straight line, yielding a constant value for the slope. Therefore, a formal linear regression is unnecessary. The value of the association constant is $K_S = 125 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$. The problem requires the result to three significant figures, which $125$ already is.\n\n**3. Comparison with Dynamic Quenching Lifetime Behavior**\n\nThe distinction between static and dynamic quenching is most decisively made by examining the fluorescence lifetime as a function of quencher concentration.\n\n- **Static Quenching:** The quenching occurs by diminishing the population of fluorophores available for excitation. The quencher forms a ground-state complex $FQ$ that is non-fluorescent. The fluorophores that remain free, $F$, are unaffected by the quencher. When excited, these free fluorophores decay with their natural lifetime, $\\tau_0$. The fluorescence decay measurement only captures the emission from this unquenched population. Consequently, the measured fluorescence lifetime $\\tau$ remains constant and equal to the unquenched lifetime $\\tau_0$ for all quencher concentrations, as observed in the provided data ($\\tau = 3.80 \\, \\mathrm{ns}$ for all $[Q]$).\n$$ \\tau = \\tau_0 \\quad (\\text{Static Quenching}) $$\n\n- **Dynamic (Collisional) Quenching:** The quencher deactivates the excited fluorophore, $F^*$, through collisions. This introduces an additional deactivation pathway with a rate constant $k_q$. The overall decay rate of the excited state becomes a sum of all decay rates: $k_{total} = k_r + k_{nr} + k_q[Q]$. The fluorescence lifetime, being the inverse of the total decay rate, is $\\tau = 1/(k_r + k_{nr} + k_q[Q])$. Since $\\tau_0 = 1/(k_r + k_{nr})$, the relationship between $\\tau$ and $\\tau_0$ is given by the Stern-Volmer equation for lifetimes:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = 1 + k_q \\tau_0 [Q] = 1 + K_{SV} [Q] $$\nwhere $K_{SV}$ is the dynamic Stern-Volmer constant. In this case, the lifetime $\\tau$ is not constant; it decreases as the quencher concentration $[Q]$ increases.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that $\\tau$ is independent of $[Q]$ for static quenching, while $\\tau$ decreases with increasing $[Q]$ for dynamic quenching.

Therefore, any change in the fluorescence signal of $F$ upon addition of $N$ must be attributable to phenomena caused by the absorption of light by $N$, i.e., IFE. Photobleaching is an independent artifact related to experimental conditions.\n\n**1. The Role of Fluorescence Lifetime ($\\tau$)**\nFluorescence quenching mechanisms are distinguished by their effect on the fluorescence lifetime, $\\tau$.\n-   **Dynamic (collisional) quenching:** The quencher deactivates the excited fluorophore. This process competes with fluorescence decay, thus shortening the excited-state lifetime. The Stern-Volmer relation holds for both intensity and lifetime: $I_0/I = \\tau_0/\\tau > 1$.\n-   **Static quenching:** A non-fluorescent complex is formed between the fluorophore and the quencher in the ground state. This reduces the concentration of fluorophores that can be excited, decreasing intensity ($I_0/I > 1$), but it does not affect the lifetime of the un-complexed, freely fluorescing molecules. Thus, $\\tau = \\tau_0$.\n-   **Inner Filter Effects (IFE) and Photobleaching:** These are artifacts, not quenching mechanisms. IFE reduces the number of excitation photons reaching the sample volume and the number of emission photons reaching the detector. Photobleaching reduces the concentration of the fluorophore over time. Neither process alters the intrinsic decay kinetics of the remaining excited fluorophores. Hence, for IFE and photobleaching, $\\tau = \\tau_0$.\n\nTherefore, a measurement of the fluorescence lifetime $\\tau$ is a critical diagnostic. If $\\tau$ remains unchanged upon addition of solute $N$, it confirms that $N$ is not a dynamic quencher. By the problem statement, $N$ is \"spectroscopically verified not to interact with $F$,\" which rules out static quenching as well.\n\n**2. Quantifying Inner Filter Effects**\nThe measured fluorescence intensity $I_{meas}$ is related to the ideal intensity $I_{true}$ by a correction factor, $C_{IFE}$: $I_{meas} = I_{true} \\times C_{IFE}$. For a right-angle geometry in a square cuvette of path length $l$, this factor can be approximated as:\n$$C_{IFE} \\approx 10^{-\\left(\\frac{A_{ex}}{2} + \\frac{A_{em}}{2}\\right)}$$\nwhere $A_{ex}$ and $A_{em}$ are the total absorbances of the solution over the full path length $l$ at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. This approximation assumes the center of the cuvette is the point of observation.\n\nWe must calculate the expected intensity ratio $I_N/I_0$, where $I_N$ is the intensity in the presence of $[N] = 50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ and $I_0$ is the intensity at $[N]=0$. The change is due to the absorbance of $N$.\nFirst, calculate the absorbances using the Beer-Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon c l$.\n-   Concentration: $[N] = 50\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{M}$\n-   Path length: $l = 1.00\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nAbsorbance at $\\lambda_{\\text{ex}} = 480\\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$A_{ex} = \\varepsilon_N(480\\,\\text{nm}) [N] l = (1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{M})(1.00\\,\\text{cm}) = 0.50$$\nAbsorbance at $\\lambda_{\\text{em}} = 520\\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$A_{em} = \\varepsilon_N(520\\,\\text{nm}) [N] l = (1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{M}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{M})(1.00\\,\\text{cm}) = 0.050$$\nNow, calculate the expected intensity ratio due to IFE:\n$$\\frac{I_N}{I_0} \\approx C_{IFE} = 10^{-\\left(\\frac{0.50}{2} + \\frac{0.050}{2}\\right)} = 10^{-(0.25 + 0.025)} = 10^{-0.275}$$\n$$10^{-0.275} \\approx 0.53088 \\approx 0.53$$\nThus, we expect the steady-state intensity to drop to approximately $53\\%$ of the original value solely due to IFE. This is very close to the observed ratio of $0.55$ with the putative quencher $Q$, strongly suggesting that IFE is the dominant cause of the intensity drop.\n\n**3. Controlling for Photobleaching**\nPhotobleaching is the light-induced destruction of the fluorophore, which causes the fluorescence signal to decrease over the course of the measurement. This artifact depends on the excitation irradiance and the total exposure time. To minimize it, one should use low excitation power and short acquisition times. To verify its contribution is negligible, one can perform a control: if the measured intensity ratio $I_N/I_0$ is independent of a change in excitation irradiance or acquisition time, then photobleaching is not significantly affecting the result.\n\n**Conclusion for a proper control experiment:**\n1.  Use the non-quenching analog $N$ in a concentration series mirroring the one used for $Q$.\n2.  At $[N]=50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$, measure both the steady-state intensity $I_N$ and the fluorescence lifetime $\\tau$.\n3.  The expected outcome is $I_N/I_0 \\approx 0.53$ and an unchanged lifetime ($\\tau = \\tau_0$).\n4.

A proper IFE control must account for absorption at *both* excitation and emission wavelengths; using a substance that matches only $\\varepsilon(480\\,\\text{nm})$ is an incomplete control. Recording only intensity and not lifetime prevents the definitive test for dynamic quenching. The predicted ratio $I_N/I_0 \\approx 0.32$ is incorrect; it appears to arise from an invalid IFE model (e.g., $10^{-A_{ex}} = 10^{-0.5} \\approx 0.316$), ignoring the geometric factors and the secondary IFE.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C.

At $[N]=50\\,\\mu\\text{M}}$, expect $I_N/I_0 \\approx 0.95$ and unchanged $\\tau$.**\nThis option proposes changing the entire experiment (detection geometry, path length to meet $A < 0.05$, and solvent viscosity) rather than performing a control on the original experiment. The goal is to understand the artifacts *in the given setup*, not to perform a different, artifact-free measurement. While front-face detection and dilute samples are valid strategies to avoid IFE, they do not serve the stated purpose of assessing artifacts in the original right-angle, high-absorbance measurement.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D.

Mixing $Q$ and $N$ would double the absorbance and complicate, not simplify, the analysis. It fails to isolate any single effect. Stating that \"no lifetime measurement is needed\" is a fundamental error, as this measurement is crucial for identifying the quenching mechanism. Claiming the ratio $I/I_0$ is \"not informative\" is patently false, as this ratio is the basis of Stern-Volmer analysis and IFE correction.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2676463"}]}
