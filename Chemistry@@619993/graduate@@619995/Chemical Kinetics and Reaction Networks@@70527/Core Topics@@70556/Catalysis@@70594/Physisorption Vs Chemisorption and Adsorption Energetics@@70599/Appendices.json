The process described, gas-phase adsorption onto a solid surface, is a fundamental topic in surface science and chemical kinetics. The given thermodynamic values are physically realistic: adsorption is typically exothermic ($\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} < 0$) and involves a decrease in disorder as gas molecules lose translational and rotational freedom upon confinement to a surface ($\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} < 0$). The magnitudes of the given enthalpy and entropy changes are well within typical ranges for such processes. The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary information to calculate the requested quantity and make the required deductions. It is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to compute the standard Gibbs free energy change of adsorption, $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ}$, determine the spontaneity of the process, and classify the adsorption type.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental definition of Gibbs free energy, $G$. For any system, it is defined as:\n$$G = H - TS$$\nwhere $H$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $S$ is the entropy.\n\nFor a process occurring at constant temperature $T$, the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$$\nThis relation is fundamental. When all reactants and products are in their respective standard states, the equation is written for standard-state changes:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T\\Delta S^{\\circ}$$\nApplying this to the specific adsorption process, we have:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = \\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} - T\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ}$$\nThis is the required expression. Now, we substitute the given values to compute $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ}$. It is imperative to maintain consistent units. The enthalpy is given in $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, while the entropy is in $\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$. We shall convert the entropy change to $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$.\n\nGiven values:\n$\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -120\\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1} = -120 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1} = -0.120\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 300\\ \\text{K}$\n\nSubstituting these into our derived equation:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = (-60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}) - (300\\ \\text{K})(-0.120\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1})$$\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} - (-36\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1})$$\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 36\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -24\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the result is $-24.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we address the spontaneity of the adsorption process under standard conditions. A process is thermodynamically spontaneous at constant temperature and pressure if the change in Gibbs free energy is negative ($\\Delta G < 0$). Since we have calculated $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -24.0\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, the value is negative. Therefore, the adsorption of molecule $A$ on surface $\\text{S}$ is spontaneous under standard conditions at $T = 300\\ \\text{K}$. The process is driven by the large negative enthalpy change, which outweighs the unfavorable negative entropy change at this temperature.\n\nFinally, we classify the adsorption as either physisorption or chemisorption based on the provided energetics. The primary distinguishing factor is the magnitude of the enthalpy of adsorption, $|\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ}|$.\n- Physisorption is characterized by weak van der Waals interactions between the adsorbate and the surface. The process is readily reversible. The typical enthalpy change for physisorption is in the range of $-5$ to $-40\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n- Chemisorption involves the formation of a chemical bond (covalent or ionic) between the adsorbate and the surface. This is a stronger interaction. The typical enthalpy change for chemisorption is significantly larger, generally in the range of $-40$ to $-400\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.\n\nThe given standard enthalpy of adsorption is $\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}^{\\circ} = -60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. The magnitude, $|-60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}| = 60\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, exceeds the typical upper limit for physisorption ($40\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$) and falls squarely within the range characteristic of chemisorption. Although it is on the weaker end of the chemisorption spectrum, the energy is too large to be explained by physical forces alone and indicates the formation of a chemical bond. Therefore, based on the energetics, the process is more consistent with chemisorption.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-24.0} $$", "id": "2664264"}, {"introduction": "Beyond thermodynamic feasibility, the kinetics of adsorption determine how quickly a surface becomes covered or activated for catalysis.
