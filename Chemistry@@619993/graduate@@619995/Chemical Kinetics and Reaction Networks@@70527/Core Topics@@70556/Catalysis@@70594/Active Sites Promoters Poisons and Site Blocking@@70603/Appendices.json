A reactant $A$ adsorbs reversibly from the gas phase onto these sites via the quasi-equilibrated step $A + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$, characterized by an adsorption equilibrium constant $K_A$ under ideal-gas and mean-field assumptions. The rate-limiting step is a bimolecular surface reaction that requires two adsorbed reactants and produces a product that transiently occupies a site, $2A* \\rightarrow P* + *$. The product $P*$ desorbs rapidly such that its coverage is negligible on the timescale of the rate-limiting step, and readsorption of $P$ can be neglected. Let $p_A$ be the partial pressure of $A$ in the gas phase, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_*$ the fractional coverages of $A*$ and vacant sites, respectively, and $k_s$ the elementary rate coefficient for the surface reaction, with the turnover frequency defined as $r \\equiv k_s \\theta_A^2$.\n\nUsing only (i) the law of mass action for the quasi-equilibrated adsorption step, (ii) the site balance over the active sites, and (iii) the mean-field approximation for lateral mixing, derive the explicit dependence of the turnover frequency $r$ on $p_A$ and $K_A$.

It presents a standard model in heterogeneous catalysis known as the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. All required definitions, constants, and relationships are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is a formal exercise in applying fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and is directly relevant to the specified topic. Therefore, I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the turnover frequency, $r$, as a function of the partial pressure of reactant $A$, $p_A$, and the adsorption equilibrium constant, $K_A$. This requires relating the surface coverage of species $A$, $\\theta_A$, to $p_A$.\n\nThe first step is to use the provided quasi-equilibrated adsorption step:\n$$A + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$$\nThe law of mass action for this equilibrium, under the specified mean-field approximation where activities of surface species are replaced by their fractional coverages, is given by the definition of the equilibrium constant $K_A$:\n$$K_A = \\frac{\\theta_A}{\\theta_* p_A}$$\nwhere $\\theta_A$ is the fractional coverage of sites occupied by $A$, $\\theta_*$ is the fractional coverage of vacant sites, and $p_A$ is the partial pressure of $A$. This can be rearranged to express $\\theta_A$ in terms of $\\theta_*$:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*$$\n\nThe second step is to invoke the site balance. The problem states that the surface contains a single population of active sites, $*$. The reactant $A$ adsorbs to form $A*$, and the product $P*$ desorbs so rapidly that its coverage is negligible. Therefore, the total number of sites is accounted for by the sum of vacant sites and sites occupied by reactant $A$. The sum of their fractional coverages must be unity:\n$$\\theta_A + \\theta_* = 1$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $\\theta_*$ in terms of $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A$$\n\nNow, we solve this system of two equations for $\\theta_A$. Substitute the expression for $\\theta_*$ into the rearranged equilibrium expression:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A (1 - \\theta_A)$$\nExpanding the right-hand side gives:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A - K_A p_A \\theta_A$$\nWe collect terms containing $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A + K_A p_A \\theta_A = K_A p_A$$\n$$\\theta_A (1 + K_A p_A) = K_A p_A$$\nSolving for $\\theta_A$ yields the Langmuir isotherm for non-dissociative adsorption:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\n\nThe problem defines the turnover frequency, $r$, as a function of $\\theta_A$ for the rate-limiting step $2A* \\rightarrow P* + *$:\n$$r \\equiv k_s \\theta_A^2$$\nwhere $k_s$ is the surface reaction rate coefficient. Substituting the derived expression for $\\theta_A$ into the equation for $r$ gives the explicit dependence of the turnover frequency on $p_A$ and $K_A$:\n$$r(p_A, K_A) = k_s \\left( \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} \\right)^2$$\n\nNext, we must determine the instantaneous observed reaction order in $A$, defined as $n(p_A) \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln r}{d \\ln p_A}$. We first find $\\ln r$:\n$$\\ln r = \\ln \\left[ k_s \\left( \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} \\right)^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\ln r = \\ln k_s + 2 \\ln \\left( \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} \\right)$$\n$$\\ln r = \\ln k_s + 2 \\ln(K_A p_A) - 2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)$$\n$$\\ln r = \\ln k_s + 2 \\ln K_A + 2 \\ln p_A - 2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\ln p_A$. We use the identity $\\frac{d f}{d \\ln x} = x \\frac{df}{dx}$.\n$$n(p_A) = \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} (\\ln r) = \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [\\ln k_s + 2 \\ln K_A] + \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [2 \\ln p_A] - \\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)]$$\nThe first term is the derivative of constants, which is $0$. The second term is $\\frac{d(2 \\ln p_A)}{d \\ln p_A} = 2$. For the third term, we apply the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d}{d \\ln p_A} [2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)] = p_A \\frac{d}{d p_A} [2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)] = p_A \\left( 2 \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A} \\cdot K_A \\right) = \\frac{2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nCombining these results gives the expression for $n(p_A)$:\n$$n(p_A) = 2 - \\frac{2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nSimplifying this expression by finding a common denominator:\n$$n(p_A) = \\frac{2(1 + K_A p_A) - 2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{2 + 2 K_A p_A - 2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\n\nWe must now show that $n(p_A)$ transitions continuously from $2$ to $0$ as the dimensionless product $K_A p_A$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$. We examine the two limiting cases.\nIn the limit of low surface coverage ($p_A \\to 0$ or $K_A \\to 0$):\n$$\\lim_{K_A p_A \\to 0} n(p_A) = \\lim_{K_A p_A \\to 0} \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{2}{1+0} = 2$$\nIn this regime, $\\theta_A \\approx K_A p_A$, so $r \\approx k_s (K_A p_A)^2$. The rate is proportional to $p_A^2$.\nIn the limit of high surface coverage ($p_A \\to \\infty$ or $K_A \\to \\infty$):\n$$\\lim_{K_A p_A \\to \\infty} n(p_A) = \\lim_{K_A p_A \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A} = 0$$\nIn this regime, $\\theta_A \\to 1$ and $r \\to k_s$. The rate becomes independent of $p_A$.\nThe function $n(p_A) = \\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A}$ is a continuous function for all non-negative values of $K_A p_A$. Thus, the reaction order continuously transitions from $2$ to $0$.\n\nThe physical reason for this transition is **site blocking**. The reaction requires two adjacent $A*$ species. At very low partial pressures of $A$, the surface is mostly vacant ($\\theta_A \\ll 1$). The rate of reaction is then limited by the probability of finding two $A*$ species together, which is proportional to $\\theta_A^2$. Since $\\theta_A$ is itself proportional to $p_A$ in this limit, the overall rate is proportional to $p_A^2$, giving a reaction order of $2$. As $p_A$ increases, the surface coverage $\\theta_A$ increases. However, the number of vacant sites $\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A$ decreases. At very high partial pressures, the surface becomes saturated with $A*$, meaning $\\theta_A \\to 1$. Almost all active sites are occupied or 'blocked' by the reactant. At this point, the surface concentration of the reactant is maximal and cannot be increased further by increasing the gas-phase partial pressure $p_A$. The rate $r = k_s \\theta_A^2$ approaches a constant maximum value $k_s$. Since the rate is no longer dependent on $p_A$, the reaction order becomes $0$. The transition from order $2$ to $0$ directly reflects the shift from a regime where the rate is controlled by the encounter of reactants on a sparsely populated surface to a regime where the rate is limited by the fixed number of sites on a saturated surface.\n\nFinally, we must determine the crossover criterion where $n(p_A) = 1$. We set our expression for $n(p_A)$ equal to $1$ and solve for the product $K_A p_A$:\n$$\\frac{2}{1 + K_A p_A} = 1$$\n$$2 = 1 + K_A p_A$$\n$$K_A p_A = 2 - 1 = 1$$\nThe crossover from an order greater than $1$ to an order less than $1$ occurs precisely when the dimensionless group $K_A p_A$ is equal to $1$. At this point, the fractional coverage of vacant sites is equal to the fractional coverage of occupied sites, $\\theta_A = \\theta_* = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe value requested is that of the product $K_A p_A$, which is a pure number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2625730"}, {"introduction": "Our kinetic models are built upon the concept of a finite number of 'active sites,' but in reality, not all surface atoms of a catalyst may participate in a reaction.

Estimate parameters via nonlinear least-squares with positivity constraints.\n- **Numerical Specifications**:\n    -   Candidate grid: $p_A \\in \\{0.02, 0.10, 0.50, 2.00, 10.00\\}$ and $p_I \\in \\{0.00, 0.05, 0.20, 1.00, 5.00\\}$.\n    -   Number of experiments: $M=8$.\n    -   Random seed: $s=12345$.\n    -   Nominal parameters for design and estimation: $k_0 = 1.00$, $K_{A,0} = 1.00$, $K_{I,0} = 1.00$.\n- **Test Suite (True Parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^\\dagger = [k^\\dagger, K_A^\\dagger, K_I^\\dagger]^\\top$)**:\n    -   Test $1$: $[5.00, 1.00, 2.00]^\\top$.\n    -   Test $2$: $[100.00, 0.01, 0.02]^\\top$.\n    -   Test $3$: $[1.00, 1.00, 50.00]^\\top$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded and Objective**: The problem is based on the classical Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, a cornerstone of heterogeneous catalysis. All definitions are standard, and the language is objective and quantitative. The premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed and Complete**: The problem is meticulously specified. It provides all necessary equations, constants, numerical values, and a complete algorithmic plan. It even addresses the potential for ill-posedness (parameter correlation) by requiring a D-optimal experimental design, a standard procedure to ensure parameter identifiability.\n- **Not Trivial or Irrelevant**: The problem integrates theoretical derivation, statistical experimental design (D-optimality), and numerical optimization (nonlinear regression). This is a comprehensive and non-trivial task that is highly relevant to the specified field of chemical kinetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is complete, scientifically sound, and well-posed. The solution process will now proceed as specified.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Rate Expression\n\nThe derivation commences from the provided fundamental relations.\nThe site balance equation is:\n$$ \\theta_* + \\theta_A + \\theta_I = 1 $$\nThe expressions for the surface coverages of species $A$ and $I$ from competitive Langmuirian adsorption are:\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_* $$\n$$ \\theta_I = K_I p_I \\theta_* $$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_I$ into the site balance to solve for the fraction of free sites, $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_* + (K_A p_A \\theta_*) + (K_I p_I \\theta_*) = 1 $$\nFactoring out $\\theta_*$ yields:\n$$ \\theta_* (1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I) = 1 $$\nThus, the expression for $\\theta_*$ is:\n$$ \\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I} $$\nThe rate of the unimolecular surface reaction is given as $r = k \\theta_A$. To obtain the final rate law, we first express $\\theta_A$ in terms of measurable quantities by substituting the derived expression for $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_* = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I} $$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $\\theta_A$ into the rate law gives the desired measurable rate expression:\n$$ r(p_A, p_I; k, K_A, K_I) = \\frac{k K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I} $$\nThis expression forms the basis for the parameter identification strategy.\n\n### Part 2: Parameter Identification Strategy\n\nThe strategy involves three stages: optimal experiment design, synthetic data generation, and parameter estimation.\n\n#### 2.1 Model Sensitivities (Jacobian)\nParameter estimation relies on minimizing the difference between model predictions and experimental data. The sensitivity of the model to parameter changes is quantified by the Jacobian matrix, $J$, whose elements are the partial derivatives of the rate with respect to each parameter in the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [k, K_A, K_I]^\\top$. Let $D = 1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I$.\nThe derivatives are:\n-   With respect to $k$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial k} = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I} = \\frac{K_A p_A}{D} $$\n-   With respect to $K_A$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial K_A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial K_A} \\left( \\frac{k K_A p_A}{D} \\right) = \\frac{k p_A D - k K_A p_A (\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial K_A})}{D^2} = \\frac{k p_A (1 + K_A p_A + K_I p_I) - k K_A p_A^2}{D^2} = \\frac{k p_A (1 + K_I p_I)}{D^2} $$\n-   With respect to $K_I$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial K_I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial K_I} \\left( \\frac{k K_A p_A}{D} \\right) = -k K_A p_A D^{-2} \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial K_I} = \\frac{-k K_A p_A p_I}{D^2} $$\n\n#### 2.2 D-Optimal Experiment Design\nThe goal is to select a small set of $M=8$ experiments from $25$ candidates that is maximally informative for parameter estimation. This mitigates parameter correlation and reduces the uncertainty of the estimates. The D-optimality criterion maximizes the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), $F$. For independent, homoscedastic measurements, $F$ is proportional to $J^\\top J$. The criterion is to maximize $\\log \\det(F)$.\n\nA greedy forward selection algorithm is implemented:\n1.  Initialize with an empty set of experiments, $S$, and a near-zero, regularized FIM, $F_S = \\epsilon I$, to ensure the matrix is non-singular and the $\\log \\det$ is numerically stable from the start. A value of $\\epsilon=10^{-12}$ is used.\n2.  Iterate $M=8$ times. In each iteration:\n    a.  For each candidate experiment $c$ not yet in $S$, calculate its sensitivity vector $\\mathbf{j}_c$ using the nominal parameters ($k_0, K_{A,0}, K_{I,0}$).\n    b.  Form a potential new FIM, $F_{S \\cup \\{c\\}} = F_S + \\mathbf{j}_c^\\top \\mathbf{j}_c$.\n    c.  Evaluate the criterion $\\log \\det(F_{S \\cup \\{c\\}})$.\n    d.  Select the experiment $c^*$ that yields the maximum value for the criterion.\n    e.  Add $c^*$ to $S$ and update the FIM: $F_S \\leftarrow F_{S \\cup \\{c^*\\}}$.\n3. The resulting set $S$ contains the $8$ optimally chosen experimental conditions $(p_A, p_I)$. This design is computed once using the nominal parameters and applied to all test cases.\n\n#### 2.3 Synthetic Data and Parameter Estimation\nFor each test case with true parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^\\dagger$:\n1.  **Data Generation**:\n    a.  The maximum noiseless rate, $r_{\\max}$, is calculated over the full candidate grid of $25$ experiments using $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^\\dagger$.\n    b.  The noise standard deviation is set to $\\sigma = 0.01 \\cdot r_{\\max}$.\n    c.  For each of the $8$ selected experiments, the \"true\" rate $r_{\\text{true}, i}$ is calculated.\n    d.  Synthetic \"measured\" rates are generated as $r_{\\text{measured}, i} = r_{\\text{true}, i} + \\text{noise}_i$, where $\\text{noise}_i$ is drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ using the specified random seed $s=12345$.\n2.  **Parameter Estimation**:\n    a.  The parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\text{est}} = [k^{\\text{est}}, K_A^{\\text{est}}, K_I^{\\text{est}}]^\\top$ are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared residuals:\n    $$ \\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\left[ r_{\\text{measured}, i} - r(p_{A,i}, p_{I,i}; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\right]^2 $$\n    b.  This nonlinear least-squares problem is solved using the `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function with the 'trust-region reflective' algorithm, which is suitable for bound-constrained problems.\n    c.  The analytical Jacobian of the residuals, $-\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, is supplied to the optimizer for accuracy and efficiency.\n    d.  The initial guess for the optimization is the nominal parameter vector $[1.00, 1.00, 1.00]^\\top$.\n    e.  Strictly positive bounds $([10^{-9}, 10^{-9}, 10^{-9}], [\\infty, \\infty, \\infty])$ are enforced on the parameters, consistent with their physical meaning.\nThe final estimated parameters for each test case are then reported, rounded to four decimal places.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the full workflow: derives the rate law, designs an optimal \n    experiment, generates synthetic data, and estimates kinetic parameters\n    for a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with competitive inhibition.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def rate_model(params, pA, pI):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the reaction rate based on the derived model.\"\"\"\n        k, KA, KI = params\n        pA = np.atleast_1d(pA)\n        pI = np.atleast_1d(pI)\n        denominator = 1.0 + KA * pA + KI * pI\n        return (k * KA * pA) / denominator\n\n    def jacobian_model(params, pA, pI):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the Jacobian of the rate model wrt parameters.\"\"\"\n        k, KA, KI = params\n        pA = np.atleast_1d(pA)\n        pI = np.atleast_1d(pI)\n        \n        n_exps = pA.shape[0]\n        jac = np.zeros((n_exps, 3))\n        \n        denominator = 1.0 + KA * pA + KI * pI\n        den_sq = denominator**2\n        \n        # dr/dk\n        jac[:, 0] = (KA * pA) / denominator\n        # dr/dKA\n        jac[:, 1] = (k * pA * (1.0 + KI * pI)) / den_sq\n        # dr/dKI\n        jac[:, 2] = -(k * KA * pA * pI) / den_sq\n        \n        return jac\n\n    # 1.
