A rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing the relationship between the product ratio and the rate constants of the competing pathways, and then relating this ratio to the given free energy difference using Transition State Theory.\n\nAccording to the Curtin–Hammett principle, for a reaction in which two products, $P_{\\text{linear}}$ and $P_{\\text{branched}}$, are formed irreversibly from a common intermediate (or a set of rapidly equilibrating intermediates), the ratio of the products is determined by the ratio of the rate constants of the product-forming steps. The rates of formation are given by:\n$$ v_{\\text{linear}} = \\frac{d[P_{\\text{linear}}]}{dt} = k_{\\text{linear}}[\\text{Intermediate}] $$\n$$ v_{\\text{branched}} = \\frac{d[P_{\\text{branched}}]}{dt} = k_{\\text{branched}}[\\text{Intermediate}] $$\nSince product formation is irreversible, the ratio of the final molar amounts of the products is equal to the ratio of their formation rates:\n$$ \\frac{[P_{\\text{linear}}]}{[P_{\\text{branched}}]} = \\frac{v_{\\text{linear}}}{v_{\\text{branched}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{linear}}}{k_{\\text{branched}}} $$\nThis ratio is the selectivity, which we will denote as $S$.\n\nNext, we use Transition State Theory to express the rate constants $k_{\\text{linear}}$ and $k_{\\text{branched}}$. The Eyring equation gives the rate constant $k$ as a function of the Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$:\n$$ k = \\kappa \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the gas constant.\n\nApplying this to our two competing pathways:\n$$ k_{\\text{linear}} = \\kappa_{\\text{linear}} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{linear}}}{RT}\\right) $$\n$$ k_{\\text{branched}} = \\kappa_{\\text{branched}} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{branched}}}{RT}\\right) $$\n\nThe selectivity ratio $S$ is then:\n$$ S = \\frac{k_{\\text{linear}}}{k_{\\text{branched}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{linear}} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{linear}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\kappa_{\\text{branched}} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{branched}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\n\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{h}$ is identical for both pathways and cancels. The problem states to assume identical transmission coefficients, so $\\kappa_{\\text{linear}} = \\kappa_{\\text{branched}}$, and this ratio also cancels. This simplification directly follows from the problem's premises, including the statement that the pre-exponential factors are equal. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{linear}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{branched}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, we obtain:\n$$ S = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{linear}}}{RT} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{branched}}}{RT}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{branched}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{linear}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nThe problem defines $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\ddagger \\equiv \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{branched}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\text{linear}}$. Substituting this definition yields the desired expression for the selectivity ratio:\n$$ S = \\frac{k_{\\text{linear}}}{k_{\\text{branched}}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right) $$\nThis is the derived expression for the selectivity ratio in terms of the given parameters.\n\nNow we compute the numerical values. The given values are $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\ddagger = +1.5~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$ and $T = 298~\\text{K}$. To maintain dimensional consistency, we must use the gas constant $R$ in appropriate units. We will use $R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$.\nFirst, calculate the value of the exponent:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT} = \\frac{1.5~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}}{(1.987 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (298~\\text{K})} \\approx \\frac{1.5}{0.592126} \\approx 2.5332 $$\nThe selectivity ratio is then:\n$$ S = \\exp(2.5332) \\approx 12.593 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the selectivity ratio is $S = 12.6$.\n\nNext, we compute the mole fractions of the linear ($x_{\\text{linear}}$) and branched ($x_{\\text{branched}}$) regioisomers. The mole fractions must sum to unity:\n$$ x_{\\text{linear}} + x_{\\text{branched}} = 1 $$\nAnd their ratio is the selectivity $S$:\n$$ \\frac{x_{\\text{linear}}}{x_{\\text{branched}}} = S $$\nFrom the second equation, we have $x_{\\text{linear}} = S \\cdot x_{\\text{branched}}$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$ S \\cdot x_{\\text{branched}} + x_{\\text{branched}} = 1 $$\n$$ x_{\\text{branched}}(S + 1) = 1 \\implies x_{\\text{branched}} = \\frac{1}{S+1} $$\nAnd for the linear product:\n$$ x_{\\text{linear}} = 1 - x_{\\text{branched}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{S+1} = \\frac{S+1-1}{S+1} = \\frac{S}{S+1} $$\nUsing the unrounded value $S \\approx 12.593$:\n$$ x_{\\text{linear}} = \\frac{12.593}{12.593 + 1} = \\frac{12.593}{13.593} \\approx 0.9264 $$\n$$ x_{\\text{branched}} = \\frac{1}{12.593 + 1} = \\frac{1}{13.593} \\approx 0.07356 $$\nRounding these values to three significant figures as required:\n-   $x_{\\text{linear}} \\approx 0.926$\n-   $x_{\\text{branched}} \\approx 0.0736$\n\nThe final computed values are a selectivity ratio of $12.6$, a mole fraction of $0.926$ for the linear isomer, and a mole fraction of $0.0736$ for the branched isomer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12.6 & 0.926 & 0.0736 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2647073"}]}
