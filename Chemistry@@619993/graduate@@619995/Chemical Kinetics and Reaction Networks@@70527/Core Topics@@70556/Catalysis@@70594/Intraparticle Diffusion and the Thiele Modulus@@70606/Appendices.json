The balance states that the net rate of diffusion into a differential volume element must be equal to the rate of consumption by reaction within that element. The general steady-state balance is given by:\n$$-\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{N}_A + R_A = 0$$\nwhere $\\vec{N}_A$ is the molar flux of reactant A and $R_A$ is the volumetric rate of generation of A.

However, the problem provides the externally measured, volume-averaged rate of consumption, $r_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. This observable quantity represents the actual, overall rate of reaction that is occurring within the pellet, averaged over its volume. It is therefore the most appropriate and practical measure of the characteristic reaction demand in the system as a whole.\n$$ \\text{Characteristic Reaction Demand} \\sim r_{\\mathrm{obs}} $$\nThe Weiszâ€“Prater number, which we denote as $N_{\\mathrm{WP}}$, is defined as the ratio of this characteristic reaction demand to the characteristic diffusive supply rate.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = \\frac{\\text{Characteristic Reaction Demand}}{\\text{Characteristic Diffusive Supply Rate}} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{D_{e} c_{s} / R^{2}} $$\nThus, the expression for the Weiszâ€“Prater number is:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{obs}} R^{2}}{D_{e} c_{s}} $$\nThis dimensionless group is constructed entirely from experimentally observable quantities ($r_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, $R$, $D_{e}$, $c_{s}$), making it a powerful diagnostic tool.\n\nThe physical interpretation of the Weiszâ€“Prater number relates to the significance of internal diffusion limitations.\n- If $N_{\\mathrm{WP}} \\ll 1$: This implies that the characteristic rate of reaction is much smaller than the characteristic rate of diffusion. Diffusion is rapid enough to maintain a nearly uniform concentration of reactant $A$ throughout the pellet, i.e., $c_{A}(r) \\approx c_{s}$ for $0 \\le r \\le R$. The reaction is kinetically controlled, and internal mass transfer limitations are negligible. The effectiveness factor, $\\eta$, is approximately $1$.\n- If $N_{\\mathrm{WP}} \\gg 1$: This implies that the characteristic rate of reaction is much larger than the characteristic rate of diffusion. The reaction is so fast that the reactant is consumed near the outer surface of the pellet, and the concentration in the pellet interior drops to near zero. The overall rate is limited by how fast the reactant can diffuse into the pellet, not by the intrinsic kinetics. Strong internal diffusion limitations are present, and the effectiveness factor $\\eta \\ll 1$.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $N_{\\mathrm{WP}}$ using the provided data:\n- $r_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 5.00\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $R = 1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $D_{e} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $c_{s} = 2.00\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = \\frac{(5.00\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2}}{(1.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.00\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})} $$\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = \\frac{5.00 \\times (2.25 \\times 10^{-6})}{1.50 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 2.00} $$\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = \\frac{1.125 \\times 10^{-5}}{3.00 \\times 10^{-5}} $$\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = 0.375 $$\nThe calculation is performed with values given to three significant figures, so the result is reported to three significant figures.\n\nBased on this result, $N_{\\mathrm{WP}} = 0.375$. This value is neither much less than $1$ nor much greater than $1$. It falls in the intermediate regime. A common engineering heuristic is that for $N_{\\mathrm{WP}} > 0.3$, diffusional effects begin to be significant. Therefore, we conclude that internal diffusion is **non-negligible** in this catalyst pellet under the given operating conditions. The observed rate is measurably lower than the rate that would be achieved in the absence of any concentration gradients.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.375}$$", "id": "2648688"}]}
