To understand the catalytic mechanism, the student prepares a series of different buffer solutions. Each buffer is made from a different weak monoprotic acid, HA, and its corresponding conjugate base, A⁻. For every experiment, the student carefully adjusts the buffer composition to maintain the pH of the solution at a constant value of 5.00. The total concentration of the buffer components ([HA] + [A⁻]) is also kept constant.\n\nThe student then measures the pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k_{obs}$, for the hydrolysis reaction in each of the different buffer solutions. After collecting data for a range of weak acids with acid dissociation constants ($K_a$) spanning several orders of magnitude, the student creates a Brønsted plot by graphing $\\log_{10}(k_{obs})$ on the y-axis against the p$K_a$ of the corresponding acid catalyst on the x-axis.

The student plots $\\log_{10}(k_{obs})$ versus $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of the acid $\\text{HA}$ and finds a nearly horizontal line, i.e., $k_{obs}$ is essentially independent of $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$.\n\nFirst, relate buffer composition to $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ at fixed pH using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH}=\\mathrm{p}K_{a}+\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right)\n\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\;\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{A^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\n=10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}.\n$$\nWith $C_{T}=[\\mathrm{HA}]+[\\mathrm{A^{-}}]$ constant, solve for $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ and $[\\mathrm{A^{-}}]$ in terms of $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{HA}]=\\frac{C_{T}}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}},\\qquad\n[\\mathrm{A^{-}}]=\\frac{C_{T}\\,10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}{1+10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\nThus, as $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ varies at fixed pH and fixed $C_{T}$, the actual concentrations $[\\mathrm{HA}]$ and $[\\mathrm{A^{-}}]$ vary systematically with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$.\n\nConsider two mechanistic regimes:\n\n1) General acid catalysis. If $\\text{HA}$ itself donates the proton in the rate-determining step, the rate law would include a term like $v = k_{\\mathrm{GA}}[\\mathrm{HA}][\\text{ester}]$, leading to an observed rate constant of $k_{obs} = k_{\\mathrm{GA}}[\\mathrm{HA}]$. In this scenario, $k_{obs}$ would depend on the acid's $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ for two reasons: (i) the concentration of the acidic form, $[\\mathrm{HA}]$, varies with $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ at a fixed pH, as shown above, and (ii) the catalytic constant, $k_{\\mathrm{GA}}$, itself is expected to vary with $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ according to the Brønsted law ($\\log_{10}(k_{\\mathrm{GA}}) = C - \\alpha \\cdot \\mathrm{p}K_a$). Both factors contribute to a systematic dependence of $k_{obs}$ on $\\mathrm{p}K_a$, which is inconsistent with a horizontal line.\n\n2) Specific acid catalysis. If the only catalytically relevant proton donor is $\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}$ and the mechanism is rapid pre-equilibrium protonation followed by a rate-determining step independent of the buffer identity, then\n$$\n\\text{ester}+\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}\\rightleftharpoons \\text{esterH^{+}}+\\mathrm{H_{2}O}\\quad(K),\n\\qquad\n\\text{esterH^{+}}\\xrightarrow{k} \\text{products},\n$$\nleading to\n$$\nv=kK[\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}][\\text{ester}],\n$$\nand thus\n$$\nk_{obs}=kK[\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}].\n$$\nAt fixed pH, $[\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}]=10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$ is constant, so $k_{obs}$ is constant and independent of the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of the buffer acid. Therefore, a Brønsted plot of $\\log_{10}(k_{obs})$ versus $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ is horizontal, consistent with the observation.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A and C invoke the Hammond–Brønsted interpretation for general acid catalysis, predicting nonzero slopes ($\\alpha\\approx 0$ small but not zero for A; $\\alpha\\approx 1$ large for C). They are inconsistent with a nearly perfectly horizontal line over several orders of magnitude in $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$.\n- B states specific acid catalysis with the rate determined by $[\\mathrm{H_{3}O^{+}}]$, which is exactly the scenario giving no dependence on buffer $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ at fixed pH.\n- D (diffusion control) would not selectively explain independence from $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ at fixed pH in buffered solutions of constant total concentration and is not the standard mechanistic inference from a Brønsted plot.\n- E (uncatalyzed) contradicts the well-known acid-catalyzed hydrolysis pathway and is unnecessary; specific acid catalysis explains the data.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible mechanistic explanation is specific acid catalysis, i.e., option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1516573"}]}
