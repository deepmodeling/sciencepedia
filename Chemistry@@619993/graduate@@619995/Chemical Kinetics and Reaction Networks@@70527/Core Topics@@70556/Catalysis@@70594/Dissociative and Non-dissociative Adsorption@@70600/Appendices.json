Time-resolved experiments offer a powerful window into these processes by tracking desorption rates as a function of time.

Low coverage ensures negligible site-blocking during the pulse.\n- After the pulse, readsorption from the gas phase is negligible, and there are no other reactions.\n- The mass spectrometer detects the $X_{2}$ parent ion with a linear, instantaneous response. Its proportionality constant is identical for $X_{2}$ originating from either pathway.\n\nStarting from first principles of microkinetics (stoichiometric balances and the law of mass action), derive the time-dependent desorption fluxes into the gas phase from the two pathways. Then, using these fluxes, obtain the closed-form analytical expression for the ratio $R_{H}$ of the peak intensity of the recombinative-desorption contribution to the peak intensity of the molecular-desorption contribution in the $X_{2}$ parent-mass channel.

The spectrum for one $\\mathrm{H}\\ast$ atom is $\\{1000, 750, 650\\}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. For two non-interacting $\\mathrm{H}\\ast$ atoms, the total set of six modes is $\\{1000, 1000, 750, 750, 650, 650\\}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$\\sum \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 2 \\times (1000 + 750 + 650)\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 2 \\times 2400\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 4800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of wavenumbers for the molecularly adsorbed state, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\ast$. The six modes are given as $\\{3200, 600, 420, 350, 220, 180\\}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$$\\sum \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{mol}} = (3200 + 600 + 420 + 350 + 220 + 180)\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 4970\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nThe change in total wavenumber sum for the surface reaction $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\ast \\rightleftharpoons 2\\mathrm{H}\\ast$ is:\n$$\\Delta\\left(\\sum\\tilde{\\nu}\\right) = \\sum \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{diss}} - \\sum \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{mol}} = 4800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 4970\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = -170\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nThe change in zero-point energy is therefore:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ZPE}} = \\frac{1}{2}h c \\Delta\\left(\\sum\\tilde{\\nu}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}h c (-170\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$$\n\nNow we can calculate the argument of the exponential for the multiplicative factor:\n$$\\text{Exponent} = -\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ZPE}}}{k_{B} T} = -\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}h c \\Delta\\left(\\sum\\tilde{\\nu}\\right)}{k_{B} T} = -\\frac{h c (-170\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})}{2 k_{B} T}$$\nWe must use consistent units.
