The problem uses $k$ for the intrinsic activation-controlled constant, which we identify with $k_{act}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the diffusion-controlled rate constant, $k_D$. We consider a stationary reactant molecule $A$ at the origin and the diffusion of reactant molecules $B$ towards it. The concentration of $B$ at a distance $r$ from $A$, denoted $c_B(r)$, is governed by Fick's second law. Under steady-state conditions ($\\frac{\\partial c_B}{\\partial t} = 0$), the diffusion equation in spherical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$ D \\nabla^2 c_B(r) = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d c_B(r)}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nwhere $D$ is the relative diffusion coefficient of the pair $A$ and $B$. The general solution to this ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ c_B(r) = C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r} $$\nThe integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions. For a purely diffusion-controlled reaction (the Smoluchowski model), the reaction is infinitely fast upon encounter. The boundary conditions are:\n$1$. At large distances, the concentration of $B$ approaches its bulk value: $c_B(r \\to \\infty) = [B]_0$. This implies $C_1 = [B]_0$.\n$2$. At the encounter distance $r=a$, the concentration is zero due to instantaneous reaction: $c_B(a) = 0$. This gives $[B]_0 + \\frac{C_2}{a} = 0$, so $C_2 = -a[B]_0$.\n\nThe concentration profile of $B$ around $A$ is therefore:\n$$ c_B(r) = [B]_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{a}{r} \\right) $$\nThe rate of encounters of $B$ molecules with a single $A$ molecule is given by the total diffusive flux across the surface of the sphere of radius $a$.

The macroscopic reaction rate per unit volume, $v$, is this rate multiplied by the concentration of $A$, $[A]_0$: $v = (4 \\pi D a [A]_0) [B]_0$. The macroscopic rate law is $v = k_2 [A]_0 [B]_0$, so the second-order rate constant in particle units ($\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$) is $k_2 = 4 \\pi D a$.

Instead of $c_B(a)=0$, we state that the flux at the boundary is equal to the rate of chemical transformation at the surface. This rate is characterized by the intrinsic second-order rate constant $k$.

The solution form $c_B(r) = [B]_0 + C_2/r$ still holds.

The term $k'_{act}$ is the particle-based activation-limited rate constant. Multiplying the entire equation by $N_A$ converts each term into a molar rate constant (in SI units $\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{k'_{\\mathrm{eff}} N_A} = \\frac{1}{k'_{act} N_A} + \\frac{1}{k'_{D} N_A} \\implies \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{act}} + \\frac{1}{k_D} $$\nThe problem provides the intrinsic activation-controlled constant as $k$, which we identify as $k_{act}$.

Transition State Theory (TST):** This method computes only $k_{\\mathrm{TST}}$. By its very construction, TST assumes that any trajectory crossing the dividing surface from the reactant side proceeds to form products without recrossing. This is equivalent to setting the transmission coefficient $\\kappa = 1$. The presence of a frictional memory kernel $\\gamma(t)$ will inevitably cause trajectories to lose energy and momentum, leading to recrossings of the barrier. Thus, the true transmission coefficient $\\kappa$ is less than $1$. TST provides only an upper bound to the true rate and is not exact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Reactive flux (Bennett–Chandler) formalism:** This formalism provides a direct method for computing the transmission coefficient $\\kappa$.

The plateau value, $\\kappa = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\kappa(t)$, exactly accounts for all dynamical recrossings dictated by the GLE. Multiplying the TST rate by this numerically computed $\\kappa$ yields the exact rate constant for the given model. This formalism is, in fact, one of the fundamental definitions of the classical rate constant.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Kramers’ high-friction formula with static friction:** This approach involves two distinct approximations. First, it replaces the non-Markovian dynamics of the GLE with an effective Markovian Langevin equation by using the zero-frequency friction, $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{static}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma(t) \\, dt$. This is an approximation valid only when the barrier crossing dynamics are much slower than the memory correlation time. Second, it uses the high-friction limit of Kramers' theory, $k = \\frac{\\omega_a \\omega_b m}{2\\pi \\zeta_{\\mathrm{static}}} e^{-\\beta \\Delta U^\\ddagger}$. This formula is an asymptotic result, valid only for $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{static}} \\gg m\\omega_b$. The problem does not specify that these conditions are met, and even if they were, the result is an asymptotic limit, not the exact rate for the general case described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Free-energy barrier plus vacuum prefactor:** This strategy is fundamentally flawed. While computing the free-energy barrier $\\Delta F^\\ddagger$ (which is here $\\Delta U^\\ddagger$) using a method like umbrella sampling is a correct way to obtain the thermodynamic part of the rate expression, combining it with a \"vacuum (no-solvent) TST prefactor\" is nonsensical. The solvent influences the dynamics in two ways: statically, by creating the potential of mean force $U(x)$, and dynamically, through friction and noise described by $\\gamma(t)$. This proposed method correctly accounts for the static effect but completely ignores the dynamic effect. The result is simply the TST rate, $k_{\\mathrm{TST}}$, which as discussed in (A), is not exact.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Grote–Hynes theory:** Grote-Hynes (GH) theory was developed specifically to solve the problem of barrier crossing for a particle described by the GLE on a potential with a parabolic barrier. For a potential $U(x)$ that is locally an inverted parabola at the barrier, $U(x) \\approx \\Delta U^\\ddagger - \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega_b^2 (x-x^\\ddagger)^2$, the equation of motion for small deviations from the top becomes linear. The stability of motion around this point, which determines recrossing, can be solved exactly. The GH transmission coefficient is $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{GH}} = \\lambda_r / \\omega_b$, where $\\lambda_r$ is the unique positive root of the characteristic equation $\\lambda_r^2 + \\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}(\\lambda_r)}{m}\\lambda_r - \\omega_b^2 = 0$, with $\\hat{\\gamma}(s)$ being the Laplace transform of the memory kernel. For the exact conditions specified in the problem statement—GLE dynamics, Gaussian noise with FDR, and a parabolic barrier—the Grote-Hynes theory is not an approximation but yields the analytically exact transmission coefficient.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Markovian embedding and spectral approach:** The problem states the memory kernel $\\gamma(t)$ is a single exponential. A GLE with an exponentially decaying kernel, $\\gamma(t) \\propto e^{-t/\\tau_c}$, can be exactly transformed into a higher-dimensional, yet fully Markovian system of stochastic differential equations. This is achieved by introducing an auxiliary variable, $z(t)$, that represents the frictional force and obeys an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process coupled to the primary coordinate's velocity. For this extended Markovian system (e.g., in the space $(x, v, z)$), the rate constant in the high-barrier limit is rigorously given by the smallest positive eigenvalue of the system's Fokker-Planck operator (or its adjoint, the backward generator). This is a fundamental result from the mathematical theory of stochastic processes. Computational methods based on finding this eigenvalue, such as those using the committor function or milestoning, are therefore capable of computing the exact rate for the specified model, limited only by numerical precision.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nIn summary, the Reactive Flux formalism provides a general, numerically exact definition of the rate. Grote-Hynes theory provides the specific, analytically exact solution for this model. The Markovian embedding provides a mathematically rigorous reformulation that allows the exact rate to be computed via spectral methods.
