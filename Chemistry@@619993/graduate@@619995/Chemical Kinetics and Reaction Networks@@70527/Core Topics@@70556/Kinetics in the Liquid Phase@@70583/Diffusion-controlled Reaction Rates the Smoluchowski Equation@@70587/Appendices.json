The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It is a fundamental exercise in chemical kinetics and statistical mechanics. We proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe first step is to simplify the two-body diffusion problem into a one-body problem. The positions of the two reactant particles, $A$ and $B$, are given by the vectors $\\mathbf{r}_A(t)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_B(t)$. Their motions are independent Brownian processes, governed by the diffusion equation. We are interested in their relative motion, described by the separation vector $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}_B(t) - \\mathbf{r}_A(t)$. Because the individual displacements are independent random variables, the mean squared displacement of the relative vector over a time interval $\\Delta t$ is the sum of the individual mean squared displacements. In $3$ dimensions, we have $\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_A|^2 \\rangle = 6 D_A \\Delta t$ and $\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_B|^2 \\rangle = 6 D_B \\Delta t$. For the relative vector, $\\Delta \\mathbf{r} = \\Delta \\mathbf{r}_B - \\Delta \\mathbf{r}_A$. Since $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_A$ and $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_B$ are uncorrelated, the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances: $\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_B - \\Delta \\mathbf{r}_A|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_B|^2 \\rangle + \\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_A|^2 \\rangle = 6 (D_A + D_B) \\Delta t$. This implies that the relative motion is also a diffusive process, governed by an effective diffusion coefficient, which we denote as $D$. From this relation, we find the effective diffusion coefficient in the relative coordinate:\n$$D = D_A + D_B$$\nThis transformation reduces the problem to considering a single particle $B$ diffusing with coefficient $D$ relative to a stationary particle $A$ fixed at the origin.\n\nThe next task is to formulate the steady-state boundary value problem for the concentration field of species $B$, which we denote as $c(\\mathbf{r})$, around the stationary particle $A$. The conservation of particle number for a non-reacting species in a diffusive system is expressed by the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$. Combined with Fick's first law, $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, this yields the diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c$. Under steady-state conditions, the concentration field does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation thus simplifies to Laplace's equation:\n$$\\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$$\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the interacting particles, the concentration field $c$ will depend only on the radial distance $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$ from the center of particle $A$. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator acting on a radial function $c(r)$ is $\\nabla^2 c(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right)$. The steady-state diffusion equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = 0$$\nThis differential equation is subject to two boundary conditions. The first condition arises from the assumption of a \"perfect absorber\". The reaction is instantaneous upon contact. Contact occurs when the center-to-center distance $r$ equals the sum of the radii of the two spheres, $R = R_A + R_B$. This is because the volume of one sphere cannot be penetrated by the other. The surface $r = R$ is therefore an absorbing boundary where any particle of species $B$ is immediately consumed. Consequently, the concentration of $B$ at this surface must be zero.\n$$c(r=R) = 0, \\quad \\text{where } R = R_A + R_B$$\nThe second boundary condition reflects the situation far from the reacting particle $A$. At an infinite distance, the concentration of $B$ is unperturbed by the reaction and remains at its bulk value, $c_{\\infty}$.\n$$c(r \\to \\infty) = c_{\\infty}$$\n\nWe now solve this boundary value problem. Integrating $\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = 0$ once with respect to $r$ yields $r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = C_1$, where $C_1$ is an integration constant. Rearranging and integrating a second time gives:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r^2} \\implies c(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second integration constant. Applying the boundary conditions allows us to determine $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nFrom the condition at infinity: $c(r \\to \\infty) = C_2 = c_{\\infty}$.\nFrom the condition at the contact surface: $c(R) = -\\frac{C_1}{R} + c_{\\infty} = 0$. This gives $C_1 = R c_{\\infty}$.\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution, we obtain the steady-state concentration profile of species $B$ around a single particle $A$:\n$$c(r) = c_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{R}{r} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } r \\ge R$$\n\nThe total reaction rate for a single $A$ particle is the total flux of $B$ particles diffusing into the absorbing spherical surface at $r=R$. The flux density vector is given by Fick's first law, $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$. Due to spherical symmetry, the flux is purely radial:\n$$J_r(r) = -D \\frac{dc}{dr} = -D \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ c_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{R}{r} \\right) \\right] = -D c_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{R}{r^2} \\right)$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the flux is directed inward, towards the origin. The total absorption rate, which we shall call $\\mathcal{F}$, is the magnitude of the flux density at the surface $r=R$ multiplied by the area of the surface, $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n$$|\\mathcal{F}| = |J_r(R)| \\times (4\\pi R^2) = \\left( D c_{\\infty} \\frac{R}{R^2} \\right) (4\\pi R^2) = 4\\pi D R c_{\\infty}$$\nThe problem defines the bimolecular rate constant, $k$, through the relation that this total absorption rate is equal to $k c_{\\infty}$.\n$$k c_{\\infty} = 4\\pi D R c_{\\infty}$$\nBy cancelling the bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ from both sides, we find the expression for the rate constant:\n$$k = 4\\pi D R$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the relative diffusion coefficient, $D = D_A + D_B$, and the contact radius, $R = R_A + R_B$. This yields the Smoluchowski rate constant for a diffusion-controlled reaction between spherical particles:\n$$k = 4\\pi (D_A + D_B) (R_A + R_B)$$\nThis expression represents the maximum possible rate for a bimolecular reaction in solution, where the reaction event itself is instantaneous and the overall rate is limited solely by the frequency of encounters due to diffusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi (R_A + R_B) (D_A + D_B)}\n$$", "id": "2639380"}, {"introduction": "Having established the concept of a steady-state rate constant in three dimensions, we now challenge this notion by exploring a different environment.

For a first-order reaction process, the population of reactants $N(t)$ would decay exponentially, $N(t) = N(0)\\exp(-kt)$, governed by a rate equation $\\frac{dN}{dt} = -kN$. The rate constant is then $k = -\\frac{1}{N(t)}\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$.\nIn our single-particle problem, the analogous quantity to the reactant population is the survival probability $S(t)$, the probability that the particle has not yet been absorbed by time $t$. This is given by $S(t) = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f(t') dt'$. The rate of change of the survival probability is $\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -f(t)$.\nAn effective, time-dependent rate constant can be defined as $k(t) = -\\frac{1}{S(t)}\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$. A well-defined macroscopic rate constant requires that $k(t)$ approaches a non-zero constant in the long-time limit, $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe analyze the asymptotic behavior of $f(t)$ and $S(t)$ as $t\\to\\infty$.\nFor large $t$, the argument of the exponential in $f(t)$ approaches zero, so $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4Dt}\\right) \\to 1$. Thus, the long-time behavior of the first-passage time density is a power law:\n$$\nf(t) \\sim \\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D}} t^{-3/2} \\quad \\text{for } t\\to\\infty\n$$\nNow we find the long-time behavior of the survival probability $S(t)$:\n$$\nS(t) = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f(t') dt' \\approx \\int_{t}^{\\infty} \\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D}} (t')^{-3/2} dt' = \\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D}} \\left[ -2(t')^{-1/2} \\right]_{t}^{\\infty} = \\frac{2x_{0}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D}} t^{-1/2} = \\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\pi D}} t^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe survival probability decays as $t^{-1/2}$, which is much slower than an exponential decay.\nNow we compute the effective rate constant $k(t)$ in the long-time limit:\n$$\nk(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)} \\sim \\frac{\\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D}} t^{-3/2}}{\\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\pi D}} t^{-1/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}} \\frac{t^{-3/2}}{t^{-1/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}t^{-1}\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the effective rate constant $k(t)$ decays to zero:\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} k(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{2t} = 0\n$$\nSince the rate \"constant\" is fundamentally time-dependent and vanishes in the long-time limit, a non-zero, time-independent macroscopic rate constant is ill-defined for this one-dimensional system. The physical reason for this behavior lies in the nature of one-dimensional diffusion. The particle performs a recurrent random walk, meaning it is certain to return to the origin, but the time it takes can be arbitrarily long. As time progresses, the reaction rate is limited by the diffusive return of particles that have wandered far from the sink, a process that becomes progressively slower. The depletion zone around the sink grows as $\\sqrt{Dt}$, and the flux of probability current into the sink diminishes accordingly, leading to the $k(t) \\propto t^{-1}$ behavior.

In this limit, the radius of the circular cap, $R_{cap} = a \\sin\\theta_0$, is much smaller than the radius of the sphere, $a$. The curvature of the sphere becomes negligible on the scale of the cap. The problem locally approximates to finding the flux to a circular absorbing disk of radius $R_{cap}$ situated on an infinite reflecting plane.\nIn the electrostatic analogy, this corresponds to finding the capacitance of a conducting disk of radius $R_{cap}$ on an infinite insulating plane. This is a classic result. The capacitance of a thin, isolated conducting disk of radius $R$ in free space is $C_{free\\_disk} = 8\\epsilon_0 R$. This is the total charge on both sides of the disk. For a disk on an insulating plane, charge accumulates only on one side (the side exposed to the electric field), which, by symmetry, is half of the total charge of the free disk for the same potential. Therefore, the capacitance of a disk on an insulating plane is:\n$$ C_{elec} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{free\\_disk} = 4\\epsilon_0 R_{cap} $$\nIn the limit $\\theta_0 \\ll 1$, the radius of the cap is $R_{cap} = a \\sin\\theta_0 \\approx a \\theta_0$. Thus, the leading-order expression for the capacitance is:\n$$ C_{elec} \\approx 4\\epsilon_0 a \\theta_0 $$\nSubstituting this result into our expression for the rate constant $k$:\n$$ k = D \\frac{C_{elec}}{\\epsilon_0} \\approx D \\frac{4\\epsilon_0 a \\theta_0}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nThis gives the final leading-order result for the capture rate constant:\n$$ k = 4 D a \\theta_0 $$\nThis result is expressed in terms of the given parameters $D$, $a$, and $\\theta_0$, and has the correct physical dimensions of volume per time ($[L^2 T^{-1}] \\cdot [L] \\cdot [1] = [L^3 T^{-1}]$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4Da\\theta_{0}}$$", "id": "2639412"}]}
