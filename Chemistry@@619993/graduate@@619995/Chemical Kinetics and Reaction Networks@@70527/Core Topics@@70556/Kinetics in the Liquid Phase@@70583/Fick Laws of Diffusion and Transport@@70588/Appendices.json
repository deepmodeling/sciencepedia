It is not trivial and requires a standard, but substantive, solution method.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive the governing partial differential equation for the concentration field $c(x,t)$. We are given the conservation law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nAnd Fick's first law for the flux $J(x,t)$:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the flux into the conservation law yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nAs the diffusivity $D$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the spatial derivative. This gives the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe problem is now to solve this partial differential equation on the domain $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for time $t > 0$, subject to the initial condition $c(x,0) = \\delta(x)$. We also assume the physically necessary boundary condition that the concentration vanishes at infinity, i.e., $c(x,t) \\rightarrow 0$ as $|x| \\rightarrow \\infty$ for any $t>0$.\n\nThis initial value problem is most efficiently solved using the Fourier transform in the spatial variable $x$.

Thus, the solution in Fourier space is:\n$$\n\\hat{c}(k,t) = \\exp(-Dk^2t)\n$$\nTo find the solution $c(x,t)$ in real space, we must perform an inverse Fourier transform:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{c}(k,t)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{c}(k,t) \\exp(ikx) \\, dk\n$$\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-Dtk^2) \\exp(ikx) \\, dk = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-Dtk^2 + ikx) \\, dk\n$$\nThe integral is evaluated by completing the square in the exponent:\n$$\n-Dtk^2 + ikx = -Dt \\left(k^2 - \\frac{ix}{Dt}k\\right) = -Dt \\left( \\left(k - \\frac{ix}{2Dt}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{ix}{2Dt}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= -Dt \\left(k - \\frac{ix}{2Dt}\\right)^2 - Dt \\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4D^2t^2}\\right) = -Dt \\left(k - \\frac{ix}{2Dt}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral for $c(x,t)$:\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-Dt \\left(k - \\frac{ix}{2Dt}\\right)^2 - \\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\, dk\n$$\n$$\nc(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-Dt \\left(k - \\frac{ix}{2Dt}\\right)^2\\right) \\, dk\n$$\nLet $u = k - \\frac{ix}{2Dt}$, so $du = dk$.

Here, the parameter $a = \\frac{1}{4Dt}$. Therefore, the value of the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\, dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/(4Dt)}} = \\sqrt{4\\pi Dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the total amount:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} c(x,t) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi Dt}} \\left(\\sqrt{4\\pi Dt}\\right) = 1\n$$\nThis holds for all $t > 0$. This confirms that the total amount of substance, which was initially $1$ due to the unit Dirac delta function ($\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x) \\, dx = 1$), is conserved over time.

Substituting this into the governing equation yields the standard one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\tau} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2} $$\nThe initial condition at $x=0$ (which corresponds to $\\tau=0$) is a step function:\n$$ c(y, \\tau=0) = \\begin{cases} c_0 & \\text{for } y < 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } y > 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThe domain in $y$ is considered laterally unbounded, i.e., $y \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. The solution to the diffusion equation for a step-function initial condition is well-known and is given in terms of the error function, $\\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^z \\exp(-t^2) dt$. The solution is:\n$$ c(y, \\tau) = \\frac{c_0}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{4D\\tau}}\\right) \\right] $$\nSubstituting back $\\tau = x/U$, we obtain the concentration profile as a function of the spatial coordinates $x$ and $y$:\n$$ c(y, x) = \\frac{c_0}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) \\right] $$\nNext, we derive the expression for the interdiffusion width $w(x)$, defined as the distance in $y$ between the locations where the concentration is $0.1\\,c_0$ and $0.9\\,c_0$. Let these locations be $y_{0.1}$ and $y_{0.9}$ respectively.\n\nFor $c = 0.9\\,c_0$:\n$$ 0.9\\,c_0 = \\frac{c_0}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y_{0.9}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) \\right] \\implies 1.8 = 1 - \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y_{0.9}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y_{0.9}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) = -0.8 $$\nLet $\\beta = \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)$, where $\\text{erf}^{-1}$ is the inverse error function. Since $\\text{erf}$ is an odd function, $\\text{erf}^{-1}(-0.8) = -\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8) = -\\beta$.\n$$ \\frac{y_{0.9}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}} = -\\beta \\implies y_{0.9} = -\\beta \\sqrt{4Dx/U} $$\nFor $c = 0.1\\,c_0$:\n$$ 0.1\\,c_0 = \\frac{c_0}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y_{0.1}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) \\right] \\implies 0.2 = 1 - \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y_{0.1}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y_{0.1}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}}\\right) = 0.8 $$\n$$ \\frac{y_{0.1}}{\\sqrt{4Dx/U}} = \\beta \\implies y_{0.1} = \\beta \\sqrt{4Dx/U} $$\nThe width $w(x)$ is the difference $y_{0.1} - y_{0.9}$:\n$$ w(x) = y_{0.1} - y_{0.9} = \\beta \\sqrt{4Dx/U} - (-\\beta \\sqrt{4Dx/U}) = 2\\beta \\sqrt{4Dx/U} = 4\\beta \\sqrt{\\frac{Dx}{U}} $$\nThe analytic expression for the width is $w(x) = 4 \\, \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8) \\sqrt{\\frac{Dx}{U}}$.\n\nTo solve for $D$, we invert this expression:\n$$ w(x)^2 = \\left(4 \\, \\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)\\right)^2 \\frac{Dx}{U} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{w(x)^2 U}{16 x \\left(\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)\\right)^2} $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for $D$.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value of $D$ using the provided experimental data:\n- Average axial speed, $U = 5.00 \\ \\mathrm{mm/s} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Downstream distance, $x = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Measured interdiffusion width, $w = 51.0 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 51.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe constant $\\text{erf}^{-1}(0.8)$ has a numerical value of approximately $0.9061938$.\nSubstituting the values into the expression for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{(51.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2 (5.00 \\times 10^{-3})}{16 (2.00 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.9061938)^2} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{(2601 \\times 10^{-12}) (5.00 \\times 10^{-3})}{32.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.821169} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{13005 \\times 10^{-15}}{26.2774} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n$$ D \\approx 4.9491 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} \\text{ (Incorrect Exponent)} $$\nLet me recompute.\n$$ D = \\frac{1.3005 \\times 10^{-11}}{0.0262774} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} = 0.49491 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} = 4.9491 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain:\n$$ D \\approx 4.95 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\nThis value is physically reasonable for the diffusivity of a small molecule solute in a liquid like water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.95 \\times 10^{-10}}$$", "id": "2642590"}]}
