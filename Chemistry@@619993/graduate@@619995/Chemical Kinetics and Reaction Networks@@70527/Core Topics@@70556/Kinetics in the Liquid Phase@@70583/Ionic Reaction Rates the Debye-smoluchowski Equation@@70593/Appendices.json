In this high-screening limit, the Debye–Smoluchowski description reduces to pure diffusion with a perfectly absorbing boundary at the reaction radius. Let the reaction occur instantaneously upon the center-to-center separation reaching a contact distance equal to the reaction radius $a$, and let the relative diffusion coefficient of the pair be $D_r$.

It describes the simplified Smoluchowski model for a diffusion-limited reaction, a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics. All required parameters and boundary conditions are provided, and the task is to derive a known result from first principles and then to evaluate it numerically. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is Fick’s second law of diffusion, which describes the evolution of the concentration field $c(r,t)$ of a species with diffusion coefficient $D_r$. In the absence of external fields, this law is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D_r \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nThe problem specifies a steady-state condition, which means the concentration field does not change with time, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation thus simplifies to the Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 c(r) = 0\n$$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the problem, we express the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ in spherical coordinates. As the concentration $c$ depends only on the radial distance $r$ from the central reactant, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for $r > 0$, we can multiply by $r^2$ and integrate with respect to $r$ once, which yields:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. This equation can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r^2}\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$\nc(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second integration constant. These constants are determined by the boundary conditions specified in the problem.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the concentration far from the reactant approaches the bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nc(r \\to \\infty) = c_{\\infty}\n$$\nApplying this to our general solution:\n$$\nc_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2 \\right) = 0 + C_2\n$$\nThus, we find that $C_2 = c_{\\infty}$.\n\nThe second boundary condition is that of a perfectly absorbing sphere at the reaction radius $r=a$. This means that any particle reaching this distance reacts instantaneously, so the concentration of the diffusing reactant at this surface is zero:\n$$\nc(a) = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our solution with $C_2 = c_{\\infty}$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{C_1}{a} + c_{\\infty}\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$ gives:\n$$\nC_1 = a c_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution, we obtain the steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nc(r) = c_{\\infty} - \\frac{a c_{\\infty}}{r} = c_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a}{r} \\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nNext, we derive the total inward particle flux into the absorbing sphere. The particle flux density $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by Fick's first law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = -D_r \\nabla c\n$$\nIn spherical coordinates, with $c$ depending only on $r$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}(r) = -D_r \\frac{dc}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the radial unit vector. We calculate the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dr}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ c_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{a}{r} \\right) \\right] = c_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{a}{r^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe flux density is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}(r) = -D_r \\frac{a c_{\\infty}}{r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nThe negative sign confirms that the flux is directed radially inward. The total inward flux, $\\Phi$, which represents the total number of particles reacting per unit time, is the magnitude of the flux density integrated over the surface area of a sphere of any radius $r \\ge a$. At steady state, this flux must be constant for any such sphere. We evaluate it at the reaction surface $r=a$:\n$$\n\\Phi = |\\mathbf{J}(a)| \\times (\\text{Surface Area of sphere with radius } a) = \\left( D_r \\frac{a c_{\\infty}}{a^2} \\right) \\times (4\\pi a^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{D_r c_{\\infty}}{a} \\times 4\\pi a^2 = 4\\pi D_r a c_{\\infty}\n$$\nThis flux $\\Phi$ is the rate of reaction for a single absorbing particle in a medium with bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$.\n\nTo find the bimolecular rate constant $k_S$, we relate this microscopic rate to the macroscopic rate law. For a reaction $A+B\\to P$, the macroscopic rate is given by $\\text{Rate} = k_S c_A c_B$, where $c_A$ and $c_B$ are number concentrations. The rate per unit volume is the rate per single A particle, $\\Phi$, multiplied by the concentration of A particles, $c_A$. Identifying $c_{\\infty}$ with the bulk concentration of the diffusing reactant $c_B$, we have:\n$$\n\\text{Rate per unit volume} = \\Phi \\times c_A = (4\\pi D_r a c_B) c_A\n$$\nComparing this with the macroscopic rate expression, we identify the second-order rate constant $k_S$:\n$$\nk_S = 4\\pi D_r a\n$$\nThis is the Smoluchowski rate constant for number concentrations, with units of volume per time (e.g., $\\mathrm{m^3/s}$).\n\nThe final step is to convert $k_S$ into molar units of $\\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$. Let $k_{molar}$ be the rate constant in these units. The relationship between molar concentration $C$ (in $\\mathrm{mol/L}$) and number concentration $c$ (in $\\mathrm{number/m^3}$) is $C = c / (N_A \\times 1000)$, since $1\\ \\mathrm{m^3} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{L}$. A more direct way is to convert the units of $k_S$.\nThe constant $k_S$ is in $\\mathrm{m^3/s}$. We wish to convert this to $\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n$$\nk_{molar} = k_S [\\mathrm{m^3/s}] \\times N_A [\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}] \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1\\ \\mathrm{m^3}}\n$$\nThe factor $N_A$ converts from a per-particle basis to a per-mole basis. The factor $1000$ converts the volume from $\\mathrm{m^3}$ to $\\mathrm{L}$.\nThus, the expression for the molar rate constant is:\n$$\nk_{molar} = 1000 N_A k_S = 4000 \\pi N_A D_r a\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$a = 1\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$D_r = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n$N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n\n$k_{molar} = 4000 \\pi (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) (5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) (1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})$\n$k_{molar} = 4000 \\pi \\times 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\times 5 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$k_{molar} = 20000 \\pi \\times 6.02214076 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$k_{molar} = 2 \\times 10^4 \\pi \\times 6.02214076 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$k_{molar} = 12.04428152 \\pi \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n$k_{molar} \\approx 3.7838402 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as requested, we obtain $3.784 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.784 \\times 10^{10}}\n$$", "id": "2649555"}, {"introduction": "Having established the diffusion-limited rate, we now introduce the influence of electrostatics.

Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\nc_\\infty = \\frac{k c_\\infty}{4\\pi D_r} \\int_a^\\infty \\frac{e^{\\beta U(r)}}{r^2} dr\n$$\nAssuming a non-zero bulk concentration ($c_\\infty \\neq 0$), we can divide by $c_\\infty$ and solve for the rate constant $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{4\\pi D_r}{\\int_a^\\infty r^{-2} e^{\\beta U(r)} dr}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for Task 1.\n\nFor Task 2, we specialize the potential $U(r)$ to the screened Debye–Hückel form:\n$$\n\\beta U(r) = \\frac{U(r)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} = z_1 z_2 \\frac{\\alpha}{r} e^{-\\kappa r}\n$$\nwhere $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the ionic valences, $\\alpha$ is the Bjerrum length, and $\\kappa$ is the inverse Debye screening length. The rate constant expression becomes:\n$$\nk = \\frac{4\\pi D_r}{\\int_a^\\infty r^{-2} \\exp\\left(z_1 z_2 \\frac{\\alpha}{r} e^{-\\kappa r}\\right) dr}\n$$\nFor Task 3, this expression is evaluated numerically. The improper integral in the denominator is computed using numerical quadrature. The provided parameters are first converted to base SI units (meters, seconds). For each of the five test cases, we define the integrand function and use the `scipy.integrate.quad` routine to compute the integral. The rate constant $k$ is then calculated and reported in $\\mathrm{m^3/s}$.\n\nThe special case where $z_1 z_2 = 0$ (Case A) provides an analytical check. The integrand simplifies to $r^{-2}$, and the integral evaluates to $\\int_a^\\infty r^{-2} dr = 1/a$. This yields the classic Smoluchowski rate constant for neutral spherical particles: $k_0 = 4\\pi D_r a$. The numerical results for other cases are interpreted based on physical principles: electrostatic attraction ($z_1 z_2 < 0$) enhances the rate constant ($k > k_0$), while repulsion ($z_1 z_2 > 0$) diminishes it ($k < k_0$). The strength of this effect is modulated by the screening parameter $\\kappa$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and numerically evaluates the Debye-Smoluchowski rate constant\n    for diffusion-controlled bimolecular ionic reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base parameters in SI units\n    base_params = {\n        'alpha': 0.7e-9,      # m (Bjerrum length)\n        'kappa_inv': 1.0e-9,  # m (Debye length)\n        'a': 0.5e-9,          # m (reaction radius)\n        'Dr': 6.0e-10,        # m^2/s (relative diffusion coefficient)\n    }\n\n    # Test suite definition\n    # Each case is a dictionary of parameters for the calculation.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Neutral reference\n        {'z1z2': 0, **base_params},\n        # Case B: Like-charged, moderate screening\n        {'z1z2': 1, **base_params},\n        # Case C: Oppositely charged, moderate screening\n        {'z1z2': -1, **base_params},\n        # Case D: Like-charged, strong screening\n        {'z1z2': 1, **base_params, 'kappa_inv': 0.1e-9},\n        # Case E: Like-charged, weak screening\n        {'z1z2': 1, **base_params, 'kappa_inv': 10.0e-9},\n    ]\n\n    def integrand(r, z1z2, alpha, kappa):\n        \"\"\"\n        The integrand function for the rate constant calculation.\n        f(r) = r^{-2} * exp(beta * U(r))\n        \"\"\"\n        # Potential term: beta * U(r)\n        beta_U = z1z2 * (alpha / r) * np.exp(-kappa * r)\n        return (1 / r**2) * np.exp(beta_U)\n\n    def calculate_k(params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the rate constant k for a given set of parameters.\n        \"\"\"\n        z1z2 = params['z1z2']\n        alpha = params['alpha']\n        kappa = 1.0 / params['kappa_inv']\n        a = params['a']\n        Dr = params['Dr']\n\n        # Analytically solve the neutral case to avoid numerical integration of a simple form\n        if z1z2 == 0:\n            return 4 * np.pi * Dr * a\n\n        # Numerically integrate for the general case using scipy.integrate.quad\n        # The integral is I = integral from 'a' to infinity of the integrand\n        integral_val, _ = quad(integrand, a, np.inf, args=(z1z2, alpha, kappa))\n        \n        # k = 4 * pi * Dr / I\n        k = 4 * np.pi * Dr / integral_val\n        return k\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        k_val = calculate_k(case)\n        # Format to scientific notation with 6 digits after the decimal point\n        # This matches the example's interpretation of \"six significant digits\".\n        results.append(\"{:.6e}\".format(k_val))\n    \n    # Print the final output in the required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2649582"}]}
