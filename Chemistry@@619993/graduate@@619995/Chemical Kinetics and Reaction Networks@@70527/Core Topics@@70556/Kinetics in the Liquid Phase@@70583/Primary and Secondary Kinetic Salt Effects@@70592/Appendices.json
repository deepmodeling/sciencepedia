First, the calculation of the ionic strength of a given electrolyte solution. Second, an assessment of the applicability of the Debye–Hückel limiting law (DHLL) for predicting kinetic salt effects in this solution, supported by a fundamental explanation of the primary kinetic salt effect.\n\nThe ionic strength, $I$, of a solution is a measure of the total concentration of ions. It is defined by the formula:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_i z_i^2$$\nwhere $c_i$ is the molar concentration of ion $i$ and $z_i$ is its charge number. The summation is over all types of ions present in the solution.\n\nThe solution is prepared by dissolving three salts in water: sodium chloride ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$) at a concentration of $0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, potassium nitrate ($\\mathrm{KNO}_3$) at $0.05\\,\\mathrm{M}$, and magnesium sulfate ($\\mathrm{MgSO}_4$) at $0.02\\,\\mathrm{M}$. We assume complete dissociation of these strong electrolytes.\n\nThe dissociation reactions and resulting ion concentrations are:\n1.  $\\mathrm{NaCl}(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}(aq) + \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(aq)$\n    - $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = +1$\n    - $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = -1$\n2.  $\\mathrm{KNO}_3(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}(aq) + \\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}(aq)$\n    - $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}] = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} = +1$\n    - $[\\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}] = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}} = -1$\n3.  $\\mathrm{MgSO}_4(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + \\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)$\n    - $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = +2$\n    - $[\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}] = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}} = -2$\n\nNow, we substitute these concentrations and charges into the definition of ionic strength:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}](+1)^2 + [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}](-1)^2 + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}](+1)^2 + [\\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}](-1)^2 + [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}](+2)^2 + [\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}](-2)^2 \\right)$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (0.10)(1) + (0.10)(1) + (0.05)(1) + (0.05)(1) + (0.02)(4) + (0.02)(4) \\right)\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} (0.10 + 0.10 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.08 + 0.08)\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} (0.46)\\,\\mathrm{M} = 0.23\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe calculated ionic strength of the solution is $0.23\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nNext, we assess whether it is scientifically appropriate to apply the Debye–Hückel limiting law (DHLL) at this ionic strength. The DHLL is a theoretical model that provides an expression for the activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ of an ion in a very dilute solution:\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant dependent on the solvent and temperature (for water at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $A \\approx 0.509\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1/2}$). The derivation of the DHLL relies on several key approximations, including treating ions as point charges and using a linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which is valid only when the electrostatic potential energy of interaction between ions is much smaller than the thermal energy, $k_B T$. These approximations restrict the DHLL's validity to a regime of very low ionic strength, typically $I \\lesssim 0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nOur calculated ionic strength is $I = 0.23\\,\\mathrm{M}$. This value is substantially greater than the upper limit of the DHLL's range of validity ($0.23\\,\\mathrm{M} \\gg 0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}$). At such a concentration, the assumptions underlying the DHLL are no longer valid. The finite size of ions becomes significant, and ion-ion interactions are too strong for the linearization to hold. Furthermore, ion pairing, especially between divalent ions like $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$, becomes prevalent, which contradicts the assumption of complete dissociation and further invalidates the model. Therefore, it is scientifically inappropriate to apply the Debye–Hückel limiting law to this solution. More advanced models, such as the extended Debye-Hückel equation or the Davies equation, would be required for a semi-quantitative estimation at this ionic strength.\n\nFinally, we explain the primary kinetic salt effect. This effect describes the influence of the ionic strength of an inert electrolyte on the rate constant of a reaction between charged species. According to transition state theory (TST), for a bimolecular reaction $A + B \\rightarrow \\text{Products}$, the reactants are in equilibrium with an activated complex $(AB)^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$A^{z_A} + B^{z_B} \\rightleftharpoons (AB)^{\\ddagger, z_A+z_B}$$\nThe rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of the activated complex. The rate constant, $k$, is related to the rate constant at infinite dilution, $k_0$, and the activity coefficients of the reactants ($\\gamma_A$, $\\gamma_B$) and the activated complex ($\\gamma_{\\ddagger}$):\n$$k = k_0 \\frac{\\gamma_A \\gamma_B}{\\gamma_{\\ddagger}}$$\nTaking the base-10 logarithm gives:\n$$\\log_{10}(k) = \\log_{10}(k_0) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_A) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_B) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ddagger})$$\nUsing the DHLL expression $\\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}$ for each species (even though it is not valid for the present case, it illustrates the leading-order behavior):\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = -A z_A^2 \\sqrt{I} - A z_B^2 \\sqrt{I} - (-A z_{\\ddagger}^2 \\sqrt{I})$$\nSince charge is conserved upon formation of the activated complex, $z_{\\ddagger} = z_A + z_B$. Substituting this in:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = -A\\sqrt{I} \\left( z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z_A+z_B)^2 \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = -A\\sqrt{I} \\left( z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z_A^2 + 2z_A z_B + z_B^2) \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = 2 A z_A z_B \\sqrt{I}$$\nThis is the Brønsted-Bjerrum equation. It predicts that the logarithm of the rate constant changes linearly with the square root of the ionic strength. The sign of the effect depends on the product of the reactant charges, $z_A z_B$.\n- If $z_A z_B > 0$ (reactants have like charges), an increase in ionic strength increases the rate constant ($k > k_0$). The inert electrolyte ions form an ionic atmosphere that screens the electrostatic repulsion between the reactants, lowering the activation energy.\n- If $z_A z_B < 0$ (reactants have opposite charges), an increase in ionic strength decreases the rate constant ($k < k_0$). The ionic atmosphere screens the electrostatic attraction between reactants, making their encounter less favorable and increasing the activation energy.\n- If $z_A z_B = 0$ (one reactant is neutral), the DHLL predicts no primary kinetic salt effect to a first approximation.\n\nWhile the DHLL is quantitatively incorrect for the solution in question, this relationship correctly describes the qualitative trend and the leading-order dependence on $z_A z_B$ for the primary kinetic salt effect at low concentrations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.230}$$", "id": "2665664"}, {"introduction": "The primary kinetic salt effect provides a powerful, predictive link between the charges of reacting ions and the rate of their reaction.

This equation is a direct consequence of the formulation given in the problem statement involving the Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(I)$, and is the standard starting point for analyzing the primary kinetic salt effect.\n\nTo determine the dependence of the rate constant on ionic strength, we take the base-10 logarithm of the above expression:\n$$\\log_{10} k(I) = \\log_{10} k_0 + \\log_{10} \\gamma_A + \\log_{10} \\gamma_B - \\log_{10} \\gamma^{\\ddagger}$$\nThe problem stipulates that the analysis should be conducted in the limit of low ionic strength, where the Debye-Hückel limiting law is applicable.

The observed rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is related to the activities of the species involved. Based on the TST formalism, $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ can be written as:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = k_0 \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\gamma_{\\ddagger}}a_{\\mathrm{w}}^n $$\nwhere $k_0$ is the rate constant at the standard state (infinite dilution), and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and $\\gamma_{\\ddagger}$ are the activity coefficients of the reactants and the transition state, respectively. Taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\ln k_0 + \\ln \\gamma_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\ln \\gamma_{\\mathrm{B}} - \\ln \\gamma_{\\ddagger} + n\\ln a_{\\mathrm{w}} $$\nWe are interested in how $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ changes with the molality $m$ of an added inert salt.

This is the Setschenow or \"salting-out/salting-in\" effect. The second term represents the effect of the salt on the activity of the solvent, water.

Let us test the hypothesis that the dominant contribution to the change in $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is from the change in water activity. This implies the salting-out/in term is negligible compared to the water activity term.\n$$ \\frac{d\\ln k_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{dm} \\approx n\\frac{d\\ln a_{\\mathrm{w}}}{dm} $$\nWe can solve for $n$ using the data for each salt:\n\nFor $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$:\n$$ -0.20\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}} \\approx n \\times (-0.10\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}}) \\implies n \\approx 2 $$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{NaCl}$:\n$$ -0.09\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}} \\approx n \\times (-0.04\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}}) \\implies n \\approx 2.25 $$\nThe values of $n$ calculated from two independent experiments are remarkably consistent, strongly suggesting that $n \\approx 2$ and that the dominant mechanism for the observed negative salt effect is indeed the depression of water activity. The reaction rate decreases because the formation of the transition state requires the sequestration of approximately two water molecules, and the addition of salt makes water less available (lowers its activity).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The measured negative slopes are consistent with $n \\approx 2$ water molecules participating in the rate-determining transition state, so that the dominant contribution to the salt dependence arises from the depression of $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ (a secondary salt effect tied to solvent structuring); kosmotropic salts such as $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$ give larger negative slopes than $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ at the same molality because they depress $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ more strongly.**\nAs derived above, the experimental data for both salts consistently yield $n \\approx 2$ under the assumption that the water activity term is dominant. This effect, where the rate is altered by the salt's influence on solvent activity, is a form of secondary kinetic salt effect. The statement correctly identifies $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$ as a kosmotropic (water-structuring) salt, which characteristically lowers water activity more than a milder salt like $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ at the same molality. The data confirms this: $|-0.10| > |-0.04|$. Correspondingly, the effect on the rate constant is larger for $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$: $|-0.20| > |-0.09|$. The logic presented is sound and fully supported by the analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The negative salt effect chiefly reflects the primary kinetic salt effect; even with neutral reactants it must be negative and scale as $\\sqrt{I}$ with ionic strength $I$, yielding comparable slopes for $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ and $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$ at the same ionic strength.**\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, it contradicts a premise of the problem, which is that the primary kinetic salt effect is absent. Second, the primary kinetic salt effect, as described by the Brønsted-Bjerrum equation, applies to reactions between ions; for neutral reactants, the product of charges $z_{\\mathrm{A}}z_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0$, so the effect is zero. Third, the Debye-Hückel limiting law predicts a dependence on $\\sqrt{I}$ at low concentrations, whereas the problem states the observed dependence of $\\ln k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is linear with molality $m$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If the transition state has a larger dipole moment than the reactants, the decrease in $\\varepsilon$ upon salt addition stabilizes the transition state more than the reactants and therefore increases $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, implying that negative salt slopes require a less polar transition state than the reactants.**\nThis statement contains flawed electrostatic reasoning. The stabilization of a dipole by a dielectric medium increases as the dielectric constant $\\varepsilon$ increases. The problem states that $\\varepsilon$ *decreases* upon salt addition. If the transition state is more polar (larger dipole moment) than the reactants, the decrease in $\\varepsilon$ will *destabilize* the transition state more than it destabilizes the reactants. This relative destabilization of the transition state leads to an *increase* in the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and consequently a *decrease* in the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The statement incorrectly claims stabilization and an increase in $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. Therefore, its conclusion is also reversed: a negative salt effect due to dielectric decrement would imply a *more* polar, not less polar, transition state.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Replacing $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$ with a non-electrolyte osmolyte (e.g., glycerol) that produces the same decrease in $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ but negligible ionic strength should largely reproduce the magnitude of the rate decrease if $n>0$; any residual difference would quantify non-$a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ medium effects such as dielectric decrement or specific-ion interactions.**\nThis statement proposes a sound scientific control experiment. The core hypothesis is that the rate change is due to the change in $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$. A non-electrolyte osmolyte like glycerol also lowers $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ but does not contribute significantly to ionic strength. If the hypothesis is correct, then matching the change in $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ using glycerol should reproduce the change in $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$. This is a direct test of the proposed mechanism. The statement further correctly points out that any deviation from the expected result would be attributable to other medium effects that differ between the salt and the non-electrolyte, such as different salting-out/in effects (solute activity coefficients), different impacts on the dielectric constant, or other specific interactions. This represents a valid and insightful comment on the experimental investigation of such phenomena.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Increasing viscosity with added salt can account quantitatively for the observed negative slopes for any reaction not under diffusion control, because higher viscosity retards the intrinsic barrier crossing step in TST even when the activation barrier is chemical rather than diffusive.**\nThis statement is misleading. First, conventional Transition State Theory (TST) assumes that once a system reaches the transition state, it proceeds to products with a universal frequency, and the rate is independent of solvent viscosity. Theories like Kramers' theory extend TST to include friction (viscosity) effects, but it is incorrect to state that viscosity retards \"the intrinsic barrier crossing step in TST\". More importantly, the applicability and magnitude of viscosity effects on chemically controlled reactions are highly dependent on the shape of the potential energy barrier and are not a universal phenomenon applicable to \"any\" such reaction. The problem is explicitly framed with the machinery of TST with activities, providing all necessary data ($n$, $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$) for such an analysis, which turns out to be self-consistent. To invoke an alternative physical model (Kramers' theory) that renders the provided data for $n$ and $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$ largely irrelevant is not the most direct interpretation. While viscosity effects and water activity effects are often correlated, the explanation in A provides a more complete and coherent account based *on the given parameters*.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2665589"}]}
