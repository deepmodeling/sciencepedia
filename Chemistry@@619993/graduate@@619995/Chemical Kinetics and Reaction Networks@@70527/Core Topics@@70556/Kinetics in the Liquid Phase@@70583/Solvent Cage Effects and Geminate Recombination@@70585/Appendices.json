All parameters and conditions are specified, and the methodology requested—utilizing the backward equation for a first-passage probability—is appropriate and standard for this class of problem. There are no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the geminate recombination probability $Y(r_{0})$, defined as the probability that a pair of particles, starting at an initial relative separation $r_{0}$, will eventually react at the surface $r=a$ rather than escaping to infinite separation. This is a classic first-passage problem. The probability $Y(r_{0})$ is a time-independent property of the system that depends only on the starting position $r_{0}$. It must satisfy the backward Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the forward Smoluchowski diffusion equation.\n\nFor a free diffusion process in three dimensions with diffusion coefficient $D$, the backward operator $\\mathcal{L}^{\\dagger}$ acting on a function of the initial coordinate $r_{0}$ is the Laplacian, $\\mathcal{L}^{\\dagger} = D\\nabla_{r_{0}}^{2}$. The recombination probability $Y(r_{0})$ is the probability of hitting the reactive boundary at $r=a$ before escaping to infinity. As a stationary probability, it must satisfy the steady-state backward equation, which is Laplace's equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\dagger} Y(r_{0}) = D\\nabla_{r_{0}}^{2} Y(r_{0}) = 0\n$$\nAssuming spherical symmetry, we write the Laplacian in radial coordinates:\n$$\nD \\left( \\frac{d^{2}Y}{dr_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{2}{r_{0}} \\frac{dY}{dr_{0}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis ordinary differential equation is valid for the domain $r_{0} > a$. The general solution is found by elementary integration, yielding:\n$$\nY(r_{0}) = C_{1} + \\frac{C_{2}}{r_{0}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are constants of integration to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nWe must now establish the correct boundary conditions for $Y(r_{0})$.\n\n1.  At infinite separation, $r_{0}\\to\\infty$: A pair starting infinitely far apart in a three-dimensional transient random walk has zero probability of ever meeting. Therefore, the recombination probability must be zero.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{r_{0}\\to\\infty} Y(r_{0}) = 0\n    $$\n    Applying this condition to the general solution gives $C_{1} = 0$. The solution is thus simplified to:\n    $$\n    Y(r_{0}) = \\frac{C_{2}}{r_{0}}\n    $$\n\n2.  At the reactive surface, $r_{0}=a$: The problem specifies a Collins-Kimball (radiation) boundary condition, characterized by an intrinsic surface reactivity $\\kappa$. This condition implies that upon encounter at $r=a$, reaction is not certain. In the context of the backward equation for the reaction probability $Y(r_{0})$, the radiation boundary condition takes the form of a Robin condition. It relates the flux of probability to the difference in probability values across the boundary. The probability of being in the \"reacted\" state is, by definition, $1$. Therefore, the boundary condition on $Y(r_0)$ at $r_0=a$ is given by:\n    $$\n    D \\frac{dY}{dr_{0}} \\bigg|_{r_{0}=a} = \\kappa \\left[ Y(a) - 1 \\right]\n    $$\n    The term $D \\frac{dY}{dr_{0}}$ represents the diffusive flux of probability at the boundary, which is driven by the \"probability potential\" difference between the state at the boundary, $Y(a)$, and the fully reacted state, $1$. The constant of proportionality is the reactivity $\\kappa$.\n\nWe now apply this second boundary condition to determine the constant $C_{2}$. First, we compute the derivative of our solution $Y(r_{0}) = C_{2}/r_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dr_{0}} = -\\frac{C_{2}}{r_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this and $Y(a) = C_{2}/a$ into the boundary condition at $r_{0}=a$:\n$$\nD \\left( -\\frac{C_{2}}{a^{2}} \\right) = \\kappa \\left( \\frac{C_{2}}{a} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $C_{2}$:\n$$\n-\\frac{D C_{2}}{a^{2}} = \\frac{\\kappa C_{2}}{a} - \\kappa\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = C_{2} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{a} + \\frac{D}{a^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = C_{2} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a + D}{a^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{2} = \\frac{\\kappa a^{2}}{\\kappa a + D}\n$$\nInserting this constant back into the expression for $Y(r_{0})$ yields the complete solution for the geminate recombination probability as a function of the initial separation:\n$$\nY(r_{0}) = \\frac{1}{r_{0}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a^{2}}{\\kappa a + D} \\right) = \\frac{a}{r_{0}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a}{\\kappa a + D} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the limit $Y \\equiv \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}} Y(a+\\epsilon)$, which physically corresponds to the recombination probability for a pair created at contact. Taking the limit $r_{0} \\to a$:\n$$\nY = \\lim_{r_{0}\\to a} Y(r_{0}) = \\frac{a}{a} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a}{\\kappa a + D} \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa a}{\\kappa a + D}\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a more suggestive form:\n$$\nY = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{D}{\\kappa a}}\n$$\nThis limiting value, $Y$, represents the probability of immediate, in-cage recombination. Its form elegantly encodes the competition between two kinetic pathways available to the contact pair. The term $\\kappa a$ and the term $D$ both have units of $L^{2}T^{-1}$, corresponding to rates. The expression is a classic branching ratio. The numerator represents the \"rate\" of reaction ($\\propto \\kappa a$), while the denominator represents the sum of the \"rates\" of reaction and diffusive separation ($\\propto D$). Thus, $Y$ is the probability that the reaction pathway is chosen over the escape pathway when the geminate pair is formed inside the solvent cage, i.e., at contact.

It describes a standard model in chemical kinetics known as the Collins-Kimball model for diffusion-influenced reactions. The governing equations and boundary conditions are standard for this model. All parameters are physically defined. The problem is valid for solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, the derivation of the eventual geminate recombination probability, and second, the identification of a characteristic timescale for the crossover between reaction-limited and diffusion-limited regimes.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the eventual recombination probability $P_{\\infty}(r_{0})$.\n\nThe eventual recombination probability $P_{\\infty}(r_{0})$ for a particle starting at an initial separation $r_{0} > a$ can be determined by solving the steady-state problem associated with the time-integrated probability density. However, a more direct physical argument can be employed. The process of geminate recombination can be conceptually divided into two sequential steps:\n1. The diffusive transport of the radical pair from an initial separation $r_{0}$ to the reactive contact distance $r=a$.\n2. The chemical reaction event at the contact distance $r=a$, which competes with the diffusive separation of the pair from contact.\n\nLet us analyze the probabilities of these two steps.\n\nThe probability, $\\Pi(r_{0})$, that a particle starting at a distance $r_{0}$ from the origin will ever reach a spherical surface of radius $a < r_{0}$ is a classic result in the theory of random walks in three dimensions. This probability satisfies the steady-state diffusion equation, which in spherical coordinates is Laplace's equation for a spherically symmetric function $\\Pi(r)$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\Pi(r) = \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^{2} \\frac{d\\Pi}{dr} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $\\Pi(r) = C_{1} + \\frac{C_{2}}{r}$. The boundary conditions are:\n- $\\Pi(a) = 1$: If the particle is already at the surface, the probability of reaching it is $1$.\n- $\\Pi(r \\to \\infty) = 0$: If the particle diffuses to an infinite separation, it has escaped and will never reach the surface at $r=a$.\n\nApplying the second condition, we find $C_{1} = 0$. Applying the first condition, we find $1 = C_{2}/a$, which implies $C_{2} = a$. Therefore, the probability of reaching the contact sphere from an initial separation $r_{0}$ is:\n$$ \\Pi(r_{0}) = \\frac{a}{r_{0}} $$\n\nOnce the particle reaches the contact surface at $r=a$, it can either react or diffuse away. The radiation boundary condition describes the competition between these two processes. The intrinsic rate of reaction at the surface is characterized by the parameter $k_{a}$. We can define an activation-controlled rate constant, $k_{\\text{act}}$, which is the rate if diffusion were infinitely fast: $k_{\\text{act}} = 4\\pi a^{2} k_{a}$. The characteristic rate for diffusion away from the sphere is given by the Smoluchowski diffusion-limited rate constant, $k_{D} = 4\\pi a D$. The probability that a particle currently at the surface $r=a$ will react rather than diffuse away is the branching ratio of these two rates. Let this probability be $P_{\\text{react}|\\text{at }a}$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{react}|\\text{at }a} = \\frac{k_{\\text{act}}}{k_{\\text{act}} + k_{D}} = \\frac{4\\pi a^{2} k_{a}}{4\\pi a^{2} k_{a} + 4\\pi a D} = \\frac{a k_{a}}{a k_{a} + D}\n$$\n\nThe total eventual recombination probability $P_{\\infty}(r_{0})$ is the product of the probabilities of these two independent events: the particle must first reach the surface, and then it must react.\n$$\nP_{\\infty}(r_{0}) = \\Pi(r_{0}) \\times P_{\\text{react}|\\text{at }a} = \\frac{a}{r_{0}} \\left( \\frac{a k_{a}}{D + a k_{a}} \\right) = \\frac{a^{2} k_{a}}{r_{0}(D + a k_{a})}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for this expression and then the limit as $r_{0} \\to a^{+}$. Taking this limit gives the recombination probability for a pair created at contact:\n$$\nP_{\\infty}(a) = \\lim_{r_{0} \\to a^{+}} \\frac{a^{2} k_{a}}{r_{0}(D + a k_{a})} = \\frac{a^{2} k_{a}}{a(D + a k_{a})} = \\frac{a k_{a}}{D + a k_{a}}\n$$\n\nNow, we check the required limits for $P_{\\infty}(a)$:\n- In the limit of infinite reactivity, $k_{a} \\to \\infty$ (absorbing boundary, Smoluchowski case):\n$$\n\\lim_{k_{a} \\to \\infty} P_{\\infty}(a) = \\lim_{k_{a} \\to \\infty} \\frac{a k_{a}}{D + a k_{a}} = \\lim_{k_{a} \\to \\infty} \\frac{a}{D/k_{a} + a} = \\frac{a}{0 + a} = 1\n$$\nThis is correct. An infinitely reactive surface ensures reaction upon contact.\n- In the limit of zero reactivity, $k_{a} \\to 0$ (reflecting boundary):\n$$\n\\lim_{k_{a} \\to 0} P_{\\infty}(a) = \\lim_{k_{a} \\to 0} \\frac{a k_{a}}{D + a k_{a}} = \\frac{0}{D + 0} = 0\n$$\nThis is also correct. With zero intrinsic reactivity, recombination is impossible.\n\nPart 2: Identification of the crossover timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cross}}$.\n\nThe transition between the two regimes described above is governed by the dimensionless parameter $\\frac{a k_{a}}{D}$.\n- If $a k_{a} \\gg D$, the reaction is fast compared to diffusion, so $P_{\\infty}(a) \\approx 1$. This is the diffusion-controlled (absorbing-like) regime.\n- If $a k_{a} \\ll D$, the reaction is slow compared to diffusion, so $P_{\\infty}(a) \\approx \\frac{a k_{a}}{D} \\ll 1$. This is the activation-controlled (nonreactive-like) regime.\n\nThe crossover between these regimes occurs when $a k_{a} \\approx D$. This condition can be rearranged to compare two timescales. Let us define a characteristic time for diffusion across the reactive length scale $a$, as given in the problem: $\\tau_{D} = a^{2}/D$. The dimensions are $[L]^{2} / ([L]^{2}/[T]) = [T]$. This timescale represents the time required for the particle to diffuse away from the reactive surface.\n\nWe must construct a second timescale from the parameters, $\\tau_{\\text{cross}}$, which represents the intrinsic time for the reaction process. The parameters defining the reaction at the surface are the radius $a$ (dimension $[L]$) and the surface reactivity $k_{a}$ (dimension $[L]/[T]$). The only combination of $a$ and $k_{a}$ that yields units of time $[T]$ is their ratio. We therefore identify the reaction timescale as:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{cross}} = \\frac{a}{k_{a}}\n$$\nThis timescale can be physically interpreted as the time required for a particle at the surface to \"react\", or traverse a distance $a$ with a \"reaction velocity\" $k_{a}$.\n\nThe crossover condition $a k_{a} \\approx D$ can be rewritten by dividing by $D$ and $k_a$:\n$$\n\\frac{a^2}{D} \\approx \\frac{a}{k_{a}}\n$$\nThis shows that the transition between regimes occurs precisely when the diffusive timescale $\\tau_{D}$ becomes comparable to the reaction timescale $\\tau_{\\text{cross}}$.\nThus, $\\tau_{\\text{cross}} = a/k_{a}$ is the timescale that controls the transition. When this intrinsic reaction timescale is short compared to the time needed to diffuse away ($\\tau_{\\text{cross}} \\ll a^{2}/D$), the reaction is diffusion-controlled. When it is long ($\\tau_{\\text{cross}} \\gg a^{2}/D$), the reaction is activation-controlled. The problem asks for this timescale in terms of $a$ and $k_{a}$. The expression is thus $\\frac{a}{k_{a}}$. The requirement to express it in seconds confirms that the final expression must have units of time, which it does.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{k_{a}}}$$", "id": "2674348"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are most powerful when they connect with experimental reality.

Squaring both sides yields $A^2 = 4 a^3 k_{\\mathrm{fit}}$, which gives:\n$$\na = \\left( \\frac{A^2}{4 k_{\\mathrm{fit}}} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{fit}} = 1.884955592 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$\n$A = 1.276166773 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1/2}}$\n\nLet us compute $a$:\n$$\nA^2 = (1.276166773 \\times 10^{-22})^2 \\approx 1.628599 \\times 10^{-44}\\ \\mathrm{m^6\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\n4 k_{\\mathrm{fit}} = 4 \\times 1.884955592 \\times 10^{-17} \\approx 7.539822 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\na^3 = \\frac{1.628599... \\times 10^{-44}}{7.539822... \\times 10^{-17}} = 0.216 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{m^3} = 216 \\times 10^{-30}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}\n$$\nTaking the cube root gives the value of the effective reaction radius:\n$$\na = (216 \\times 10^{-30}\\ \\mathrm{m^3})^{1/3} = 6 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNow we can compute the diffusion coefficient $D$ using $D = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{fit}}}{4 \\pi a}$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1.884955592 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}}{4 \\pi (6 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{1.884955592 \\times 10^{-17}}{24 \\pi \\times 10^{-10}}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the fact that $k_{\\mathrm{fit}}$ is numerically equal to $6 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{6 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}}{24 \\pi \\times 10^{-10}}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires expressing $a$ in nanometers and $D$ in units of $10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$, rounded to three significant figures.\nFor the radius $a$:\n$$\na = 6 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $0.600$ nm.\n\nFor the diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\nD = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nIn units of $10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$, the value is $2.5$.

At the longest time in the fitting interval, $t = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, we have $\\delta(t) = \\sqrt{(2.5 \\times 10^{-9}) (10^{-9})} \\approx 1.58 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Our result for $a$ is $0.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The condition $\\delta(t) \\ll a$ is not met. This implies that this assumption was included to provide physical context for the transient regime, rather than to be used for a mathematical approximation which would have been incorrect.
