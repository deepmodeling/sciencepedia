A solution will be provided.\n\nDerivation of the Kinetic Salt Effect\nAccording to Transition State Theory (TST), a bimolecular reaction between reactants $A$ and $B$ proceeds through a pre-equilibrium with an activated complex, denoted $C^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$A + B \\rightleftharpoons C^{\\ddagger} \\rightarrow \\text{Products}$$\nThe equilibrium constant for the formation of the activated complex, $K^{\\ddagger}$, is defined in terms of activities ($a_i$):\n$$K^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{a^{\\ddagger}}{a_A a_B}$$\nBy definition, the activity of a species $i$ is related to its molar concentration $[i]$ by the activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$, such that $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$. Substituting this into the expression for $K^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$K^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{\\gamma^{\\ddagger} [C^{\\ddagger}]}{\\gamma_A [A] \\gamma_B [B]}$$\nThe concentration of the activated complex can be expressed as:\n$$[C^{\\ddagger}] = K^{\\ddagger} \\frac{\\gamma_A \\gamma_B}{\\gamma^{\\ddagger}} [A] [B]$$\nThe rate of the reaction, $\\nu$, is proportional to the concentration of the activated complex:\n$$\\nu = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h}\\right)\\kappa [C^{\\ddagger}]$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient.\nSubstituting the expression for $[C^{\\ddagger}]$:\n$$\\nu = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h}\\right)\\kappa K^{\\ddagger} \\frac{\\gamma_A \\gamma_B}{\\gamma^{\\ddagger}} [A] [B]$$\nThe macroscopic rate law for this bimolecular reaction is $\\nu = k[A][B]$, where $k$ is the observed second-order rate constant. By comparing the two expressions for the rate, we identify $k$ as:\n$$k = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h}\\right)\\kappa K^{\\ddagger} \\frac{\\gamma_A \\gamma_B}{\\gamma^{\\ddagger}}$$\nThe rate constant in the limit of infinite dilution, $k(0)$, corresponds to the case where ionic strength $I \\to 0$ and all activity coefficients approach unity ($\\gamma_i \\to 1$). Therefore:\n$$k(0) = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h}\\right)\\kappa K^{\\ddagger}$$\nThis term, $k(0)$, is considered constant with respect to ionic strength, based on the problem's premise that $\\kappa$ and non-electrostatic contributions (embedded within $K^{\\ddagger}$) are independent of $I$.\nThe ratio of the rate constant at ionic strength $I$, denoted $k(I)$, to the rate constant at infinite dilution is then:\n$$\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)} = \\frac{\\gamma_A \\gamma_B}{\\gamma^{\\ddagger}}$$\nTo analyze the dependence on ionic strength, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}\\right) = \\log_{10}(\\gamma_A) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_B) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma^{\\ddagger})$$\nNow, we apply the Debye-Hückel limiting law, $\\log_{10}\\gamma_i = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}$, where $z_i$ is the charge number of species $i$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}\\right) = (-A z_A^2 \\sqrt{I}) + (-A z_B^2 \\sqrt{I}) - (-A (z^{\\ddagger})^2 \\sqrt{I})$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}\\right) = -A\\sqrt{I} \\left( z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z^{\\ddagger})^2 \\right)$$\nThe problem states that for the association step, the charge of the activated complex is $z^{\\ddagger} = z_A + z_B$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z^{\\ddagger})^2 = z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z_A + z_B)^2 = z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z_A^2 + 2z_A z_B + z_B^2) = -2z_A z_B$$\nSubstituting this result back gives the final derived expression, known as the Brønsted-Bjerrum equation for the limiting law case:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}\\right) = -A\\sqrt{I} (-2z_A z_B) = 2 A z_A z_B \\sqrt{I}$$\n\nNumerical Evaluation\nWe are given the values: $z_A = +2$, $z_B = +2$, $A = 0.509$, and $I = 0.05$.\nSubstituting these into the derived formula:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}\\right) = 2(0.509)(+2)(+2)\\sqrt{0.05}$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}\\right) = 4.072 \\times \\sqrt{0.05} \\approx 4.072 \\times 0.22360679... \\approx 0.91053$$\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)}$, we take $10$ to the power of this value:\n$$\\frac{k(I)}{k(0)} = 10^{0.91053...} \\approx 8.1384$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the numerical value of the ratio is $8.14$.\n\nDiscussion on Deviations from the Limiting Law\nDeviations from the Debye-Hückel limiting law are expected to be significant at an ionic strength of $I=0.05$. The limiting law is rigorously valid only in the limit of $I \\to 0$, and in practice, it is generally considered a reasonable approximation only for $I < 0.01\\ \\mathrm{M}$ for singly charged ions.\nThe physical reasons for this are as follows:\n1.  **Finite Ion Size**: The limiting law treats ions as point charges. In reality, ions have a finite size. At $I=0.05$, the average distance between ions is small enough that their physical volumes cannot be ignored. The extended Debye-Hückel equation, which includes an ion-size parameter, provides a more accurate description by accounting for the fact that ions cannot approach each other more closely than their ionic radii allow. This effect typically reduces the magnitude of the activity coefficient correction, meaning the limiting law overestimates the effect.\n2.  **High Ionic Charges**: The reactants are doubly charged ($z_A = +2$, $z_B = +2$), and the activated complex is highly charged ($z^{\\ddagger} = +4$). The electrostatic interactions are proportional to the product of charges, $z_i^2$, making them very strong. Stronger interactions lead to a more structured and dense ionic atmosphere around each ion, causing the point-charge and linearized Poisson-Boltzmann approximations underlying the limiting law to fail at lower ionic strengths than they would for singly charged ions.\n3.  **Specific Ion Interactions**: At $I=0.05$, short-range, non-electrostatic interactions and solvent-ion interactions, which are specific to the chemical nature of the ions present, become non-negligible. The limiting law ignores these effects completely.\n\nGiven these factors, particularly the relatively high ionic strength and the high charges of the reacting species, the prediction from the limiting law is likely to be a quantitative overestimation of the true kinetic salt effect.
