I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe overall reaction is the conversion of $A$ to products. The rate of this reaction, $v$, is defined by the rate of formation of the final products. According to the second elementary step of the mechanism, this rate is:\n$$v = \\frac{d[\\text{products}]}{dt} = k_{2}[A^{\\ast}]$$\n\nTo express this rate in terms of the stable reactant concentration $[A]$, we must find an expression for the intermediate concentration $[A^{\\ast}]$. We apply the steady-state approximation (SSA) to $A^{\\ast}$, which assumes that the concentration of this short-lived intermediate is constant, i.e., its rate of change is zero.\n$$\\frac{d[A^{\\ast}]}{dt} = 0$$\n\nThe species $A^{\\ast}$ is formed in the forward first step and consumed in the reverse first step and in the second step. From the law of mass action, we write the rate equation for $[A^{\\ast}]$:\n$$\\frac{d[A^{\\ast}]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][M] - k_{-1}[A^{\\ast}][M] - k_{2}[A^{\\ast}]$$\n\nApplying the SSA:\n$$k_{1}[A][M] - k_{-1}[A^{\\ast}][M] - k_{2}[A^{\\ast}] = 0$$\n\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $[A^{\\ast}]$:\n$$k_{1}[A][M] = (k_{-1}[M] + k_{2})[A^{\\ast}]$$\n$$[A^{\\ast}] = \\frac{k_{1}[A][M]}{k_{-1}[M] + k_{2}}$$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $[A^{\\ast}]$ back into the rate law for product formation:\n$$v = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}[A][M]}{k_{-1}[M] + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[A][M]}{k_{-1}[M] + k_{2}}$$\n\nThe overall reaction is observed to be first-order in $A$, with an effective rate coefficient $k_{\\text{eff}}$ that depends on the concentration of the bath gas, $[M]$. The rate law is written as $v = k_{\\text{eff}}[A]$.\nBy comparing this form with our derived rate law, we identify the expression for $k_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n**1. Derive $k_{\\text{eff}}([M])$**\n$$k_{\\text{eff}}([M]) = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[M]}{k_{-1}[M] + k_{2}}$$\n\n**2. Determine the high-pressure limit, $k_{\\infty}$**\nThe high-pressure limit is defined as the limit of $k_{\\text{eff}}$ as the bath gas concentration $[M]$ approaches infinity.\n$$k_{\\infty} = \\lim_{[M] \\to \\infty} k_{\\text{eff}}([M]) = \\lim_{[M] \\to \\infty} \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[M]}{k_{-1}[M] + k_{2}}$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $[M]$:\n$$k_{\\infty} = \\lim_{[M] \\to \\infty} \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + \\frac{k_{2}}{[M]}}$$\nAs $[M] \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{k_{2}}{[M]} \\to 0$. Therefore, the limit is:\n$$k_{\\infty} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}$$\n\n**3. Determine $[M]_{1/2}$**\nWe must find the concentration $[M]_{1/2}$ at which the effective rate coefficient is half of its high-pressure limit value, i.e., $k_{\\text{eff}}([M]_{1/2}) = \\frac{k_{\\infty}}{2}$.\n$$\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[M]_{1/2}}{k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} + k_{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}} \\right)$$\nThe term $k_{1}k_{2}$ is non-zero and appears on both sides, so it can be canceled.\n$$\\frac{[M]_{1/2}}{k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} + k_{2}} = \\frac{1}{2k_{-1}}$$\nNow, we perform cross-multiplication:\n$$2k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} = k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} + k_{2}$$\nSolving for $[M]_{1/2}$:\n$$2k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} - k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} = k_{2}$$\n$$k_{-1}[M]_{1/2} = k_{2}$$\n$$[M]_{1/2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1}}$$\n\n**4. Determine the pressure $P_{1/2}$**\nAssuming the bath gas $M$ behaves as an ideal gas, its concentration $[M]$ is related to its pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ by the ideal gas law, $[M] = \\frac{P}{RT}$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. The pressure $P_{1/2}$ corresponds to the concentration $[M]_{1/2}$.\n$$[M]_{1/2} = \\frac{P_{1/2}}{RT}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[M]_{1/2}$ that we found:\n$$\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{P_{1/2}}{RT}$$\nSolving for $P_{1/2}$ gives the final expression.\n$$P_{1/2} = \\frac{k_{2}RT}{k_{-1}}$$\nThe units are consistent, as a ratio of a unimolecular rate constant ($s^{-1}$) to a bimolecular rate constant ($concentration^{-1} s^{-1}$) gives units of concentration. Multiplying by $RT$ yields units of pressure.\n\nThe condition that defines $P_{1/2}$ corresponds to the bath-gas concentration at which the rate of unimolecular decay of the energized intermediate ($k_2$) equals its rate of collisional deactivation ($k_{-1}[M]$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_{2} R T}{k_{-1}}}$$", "id": "2693115"}, {"introduction": "With the theoretical framework in place, we now apply it to a classic chemical system: the isomerization of methyl isocyanide.
