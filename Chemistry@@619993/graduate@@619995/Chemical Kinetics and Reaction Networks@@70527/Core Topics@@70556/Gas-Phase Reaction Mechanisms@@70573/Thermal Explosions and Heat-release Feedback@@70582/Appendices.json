A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the behavior of the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$, as a function of the geometry index $n$. The dimensionless equation is\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\theta + \\delta e^{\\theta} = 0\n$$\nwhere the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ takes different forms depending on the geometry. The term $\\xi^{-n} d/d\\xi (\\xi^{n} d/d\\xi)$ is precisely this operator in generalized coordinates for the specified geometries. The efficiency of heat removal from the body's interior to its surface is dependent on the geometry. For a fixed characteristic dimension $L$, a sphere has the largest surface-area-to-volume ratio, followed by the cylinder, and then the infinite slab. Greater surface area per unit volume allows for more efficient heat dissipation. Consequently, a geometry that dissipates heat more effectively can sustain a higher rate of internal heat generation before thermal runaway occurs. A higher sustainable heat generation rate corresponds to a larger value of the critical parameter $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n\nTherefore, the critical values are ordered according to the geometric efficiency of heat removal:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(\\text{slab}) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(\\text{cylinder}) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(\\text{sphere})\n$$\nIn terms of the index $n$, this is:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)\n$$\nThe established values from the literature, which are solutions to the boundary value problem at the point of bifurcation, confirm this physical reasoning:\n- For slab ($n=0$): $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) \\approx 0.878$\n- For cylinder ($n=1$): $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1) = 2$ (an exact result)\n- For sphere ($n=2$): $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2) \\approx 3.322$\n\nWith this fundamental understanding, we evaluate each option. The normalized safety margin is given by $S(n) = 1 - \\delta / \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. If $\\delta$ is matched across slab, cylinder, and sphere, then the normalized safety margin $S(n)$ is the same for all three geometries.**\nThe safety margin is $S(n) = 1 - \\delta / \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$. The problem states that $\\delta$ is the same for all three geometries. However, as established above, the critical parameter $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$ is different for each geometry $n$. Since $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) \\neq \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1) \\neq \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)$, the ratio $\\delta / \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$ will be different for each $n$. Consequently, the safety margin $S(n)$ cannot be the same for all three geometries.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For fixed $\\delta$, the sphere has the largest normalized safety margin and the slab the smallest, because $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2) > \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1) > \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)$ due to geometry-dependent heat removal.**\nWe established the inequality $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)$. Taking the reciprocal reverses the inequalities:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)} > \\frac{1}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1)} > \\frac{1}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)}\n$$\nMultiplying by the positive constant $\\delta$ preserves the inequalities:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)} > \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1)} > \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)}\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and adding $1$ to all parts reverses the inequalities again:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)} < 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1)} < 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $S(0) < S(1) < S(2)$. Thus, the safety margin for the slab ($n=0$) is the smallest, and the safety margin for the sphere ($n=2$) is the largest. The reasoning provided in the statement is also correct: this ordering is due to the hierarchy of critical values, which in turn reflects the geometry-dependent heat removal efficiency.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)$ for the slab, then the cylinder and sphere are also subcritical (safe) at that same $\\delta$.**\nThe condition for a system to be subcritical, or \"safe,\" is $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$. We are given that the slab is safe, which means $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)$. We have the established ordering $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)$.\nFrom $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1)$, it follows by the transitive property of inequalities that $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(1)$. Therefore, the cylinder is also safe.\nSimilarly, from $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0)$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(0) < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)$, it follows that $\\delta < \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(2)$. Therefore, the sphere is also safe. The statement is a direct logical consequence of the ordering of the critical parameters.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Matching $\\delta$ across geometries implies that the centerline temperature rise and stability properties are identical across slab, cylinder, and sphere.**\nThe centerline temperature rise is $\\theta_0 = \\theta(\\xi=0)$. The value of $\\theta_0$ is found by solving the boundary-value problem for a given $\\delta$ and $n$. Since the differential operator $\\xi^{-n} d/d\\xi (\\xi^{n} d/d\\xi)$ depends explicitly on the geometry index $n$, the solution profile $\\theta(\\xi)$ will be different for each value of $n$, even if $\\delta$ is held constant. Therefore, the centerline temperature $\\theta_0$ will not be identical across the geometries. The \"stability properties\" are also not identical. As shown in the analysis of options A and B, the normalized safety margin $S(n)$, which is a measure of stability, is geometry-dependent.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The critical parameter $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$ arises from a turning point (saddle-node) in the steady heat-release versus heat-removal balance, and its value depends on geometry through the differential operator $\\xi^{-n} d/d\\xi (\\xi^{n} d/d\\xi)$; therefore equal $\\delta$ does not generally imply equal safety margins across geometries.**\nThis statement provides a correct and concise summary of the underlying theory. The loss of steady solutions for $\\delta > \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$ corresponds mathematically to a saddle-node bifurcation, or a turning point in the solution branch diagram (e.g., a plot of $\\theta_0$ versus $\\delta$). The location of this turning point, which defines $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$, is determined by solving the governing BVP, whose operator explicitly depends on the geometry index $n$. The conclusion logically follows: since $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$ is a function of geometry and the safety margin $S(n) = 1 - \\delta / \\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$ depends on $\\delta_{\\mathrm{cr}}(n)$, equal $\\delta$ across different geometries does not imply equal safety margins.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2689479"}, {"introduction": "While steady-state analysis identifies the critical threshold for an explosion, transient analysis reveals the dynamic pathway to runaway.

The final output format must be exactly of the form\n[True,False,True]\nwith no additional text. All quantities in this problem are dimensionless, so no physical units are required in the output.", "solution": "The problem presented is a comprehensive and valid exercise in the classical theory of thermal explosions, covering theoretical derivation, mathematical analysis, and numerical simulation. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and heat transfer, and the formulation is well-posed and self-contained. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Task A: Derivation of the Dimensionless Reaction–Diffusion Equation\n\nThe starting point is the dimensional energy balance for a homogeneous medium with an exothermic chemical reaction, neglecting convection and reactant consumption:\n$$\n\\rho C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k_{th} \\nabla^2 T + Q c_0 A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density, $C_p$ is the specific heat capacity, $T(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is the temperature, $k_{th}$ is the thermal conductivity, $Q$ is the molar heat of reaction, $c_0$ is the reactant concentration (assumed constant), and the final term represents the heat release rate governed by Arrhenius kinetics, with $A$ being the pre-exponential factor, $E$ the activation energy, and $R$ the universal gas constant.\n\nWe introduce dimensionless variables to perform the Frank-Kamenetskii asymptotic reduction, which is valid in the high activation energy limit, $E \\gg RT_a$, where $T_a$ is the ambient temperature.\n\n1.  **Dimensionless Variables**:\n    Let $L$ be a characteristic length scale of the system. We define:\n    -   Dimensionless spatial coordinate: $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = \\mathbf{x} / L$\n    -   Dimensionless temperature (Frank-Kamenetskii scaling): $\\theta = \\frac{T - T_a}{T_a} \\frac{E}{RT_a}$. This scaling choice is crucial, as it leads to a single-parameter model in the asymptotic limit. We can express the dimensional temperature as $T = T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)$.\n    -   Dimensionless time: $\\tau = t / t_c$, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time scale to be determined.\n\n2.  **Transformation of the Heat Equation**:\n    We compute the terms in the heat equation using these new variables.\n    -   Time derivative: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)\\right] = T_a \\frac{RT_a}{E} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{RT_a^2}{E t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau}$.\n    -   Laplacian: $\\nabla^2 T = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 \\left[T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{RT_a^2}{E} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 \\theta$. Since $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}$, we have $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2$. Thus, $\\nabla^2 T = \\frac{RT_a^2}{E L^2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta$.\n\n3.  **Approximation of the Arrhenius Term**: The exponent is $-E/(RT)$. Substituting for $T$:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{E}{RT} = -\\frac{E}{R T_a \\left(1 + \\theta \\frac{RT_a}{E}\\right)}\n    $$\n    Let $\\epsilon = RT_a/E$. In the high activation energy limit, $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. The exponent becomes:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + \\epsilon \\theta)}\n    $$\n    Using the Taylor expansion $1/(1+z) \\approx 1-z$ for small $z = \\epsilon\\theta$, we get:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}(1 - \\epsilon \\theta + O(\\epsilon^2)) = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} + \\theta + O(\\epsilon)\n    $$\n    The Arrhenius term is then approximated as:\n    $$\n    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a} + \\theta\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right) e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    This is the Frank-Kamenetskii approximation.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Dimensionless Equation**:\n    Substituting the transformed terms into the original energy balance:\n    $$\n    \\rho C_p \\left(\\frac{RT_a^2}{E t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau}\\right) = k_{th} \\left(\\frac{RT_a^2}{E L^2} \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta\\right) + Q c_0 A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right) e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    To simplify, we multiply the entire equation by $\\frac{E L^2}{k_{th} R T_a^2}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\rho C_p L^2}{k_{th} t_c} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta + \\left[\\frac{E L^2 Q c_0 A}{k_{th} R T_a^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right)\\right] e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    We choose the characteristic time $t_c$ to be the thermal diffusion time, $t_c = L^2 / \\alpha$, where $\\alpha = k_{th} / (\\rho C_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity. This sets the coefficient of the time derivative to $1$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\rho C_p L^2}{k_{th} (L^2 \\rho C_p / k_{th})} = 1\n    $$\n    The equation becomes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\tau} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}^2 \\theta + \\delta e^{\\theta}\n    $$\n    where we have defined the single dimensionless heat-release parameter, the **Frank-Kamenetskii parameter $\\delta$**:\n    $$\n    \\delta = \\frac{E}{R T_a^2} \\frac{Q c_0 L^2}{k_{th}} A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_a}\\right)\n    $$\n    This parameter represents the ratio of the characteristic rate of heat generation to the characteristic rate of heat removal by diffusion.\n\n5.  **Initial-Boundary Value Problem**:\n    The boundary condition $T=T_a$ on the physical boundary $\\partial\\Omega_{phys}$ becomes, in terms of $\\theta$:\n    $$\n    \\theta = \\frac{T_a - T_a}{T_a} \\frac{E}{RT_a} = 0\n    $$\n    This is a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the dimensionless boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. An initial condition $T(\\mathbf{x},0) = T_0(\\mathbf{x})$ translates to an initial condition for $\\theta$. Renaming variables for convention ($\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\to \\mathbf{x}$, $\\tau \\to t$), the final dimensionless initial-boundary value problem is:\n    $$\n    \\begin{cases}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\nabla^2 \\theta + \\delta e^{\\theta}, & \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega, t > 0 \\\\\n    \\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t) = 0, & \\mathbf{x} \\in \\partial\\Omega, t > 0 \\\\\n    \\theta(\\mathbf{x}, 0) = \\theta_0(\\mathbf{x}), & \\mathbf{x} \\in \\Omega\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n### Task B: Mathematical Characterization of Criticality\n\nWe analyze the one-dimensional problem on the domain $x \\in (0,1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} + \\delta e^{\\theta}\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $\\theta(0, t) = \\theta(1, t) = 0$.\n\nThe existence of thermal runaway (blowup) versus bounded behavior is determined by the properties of the corresponding steady-state problem:\n$$\n\\theta_s''(x) + \\delta e^{\\theta_s(x)} = 0, \\quad x \\in (0,1)\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $\\theta_s(0) = \\theta_s(1) = 0$. We seek non-trivial positive solutions, $\\theta_s(x) > 0$ on $(0,1)$.\n\n1.  **Existence of Steady Solutions**: The equation $\\theta_s'' = -\\delta e^{\\theta_s}$ shows that for $\\delta > 0$, any non-trivial solution must be strictly concave ($\\theta_s'' < 0$). Combined with the zero boundary conditions, this implies any such solution is positive in the interior, symmetric about $x=1/2$, and has a single maximum $\\theta_m = \\theta_s(1/2)$. The existence and number of solutions to this nonlinear boundary value problem depend on the parameter $\\delta$.\n    -   For $\\delta=0$, the only solution is the trivial one, $\\theta_s(x) = 0$.\n    -   As $\\delta$ increases from $0$, a pair of positive solutions emerges through a saddle-node bifurcation. This can be understood by considering a bifurcation diagram of $\\delta$ versus the maximum temperature $\\theta_m$. This curve starts at $(\\theta_m, \\delta) = (0, 0)$, increases to a maximum value $\\delta = \\delta_c$ at some $\\theta_m = \\theta_{m,c}$, and then turns back, decreasing for larger $\\theta_m$.\n    -   This 'nose-shaped' bifurcation curve implies that:\n        -   For $0 < \\delta < \\delta_c$, there exist exactly two steady solutions: a lower-branch solution with smaller $\\theta_m$ and an upper-branch solution with larger $\\theta_m$.\n        -   For $\\delta = \\delta_c$, there is exactly one solution.\n        -   For $\\delta > \\delta_c$, there are no steady solutions.\n\n2.  **Stability and Transient Behavior**: The behavior of the transient equation is governed by these steady states.\n    -   **Subcritical case ($0 < \\delta < \\delta_c$)**: Analysis shows that the lower-branch solution is stable, while the upper-branch solution is unstable. By the maximum principle for parabolic equations, the stable steady solution can act as a stationary supersolution. If the initial data $\\theta(x,0)$ is \"small enough\" (e.g., lies entirely below the stable steady-state profile), the solution $\\theta(x,t)$ will be bounded for all time and will typically converge to this stable steady state.\n    -   **Supercritical case ($\\delta > \\delta_c$)**: In this regime, no steady solution exists. There is no stationary state for the system to settle into. The physical interpretation is that the rate of heat generation, scaled by $\\delta$, is too large to be balanced by heat diffusion. For any sufficiently positive initial condition, the nonlinear source term $\\delta e^{\\theta}$ will dominate the linear diffusion term $\\theta_{xx}$. The temperature will rise, which further accelerates the reaction rate, leading to a positive feedback loop. This self-accelerating process, unhindered by any stable equilibrium, results in the solution becoming unbounded in finite time, i.e., $\\max_x \\theta(x,t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to t_b$ for some finite blowup time $t_b$. This is thermal runaway.\n\nThus, the critical parameter $\\delta_c$ marks the threshold for the existence of an equilibrium between heat generation and heat removal. Below this threshold, a stable balance is possible for small perturbations; above it, no such balance exists, and runaway is inevitable for non-trivial heating.\n\n### Task C: Numerical Implementation Approach\n\nThe task is to solve the one-dimensional transient problem numerically using the method-of-lines.\n\n1.  **Spatial Discretization**: We discretize the spatial domain $x \\in [0,1]$ into $N+2$ points, $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, \\dots, N+1$, where $h=1/(N+1)$ is the uniform grid spacing. We are interested in the $N$ interior points. Let $\\theta_i(t)$ be the numerical approximation of $\\theta(x_i, t)$. The second-order central difference approximation for the Laplacian is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x=x_i} \\approx \\frac{\\theta_{i-1}(t) - 2\\theta_i(t) + \\theta_{i+1}(t)}{h^2}\n    $$\n    The boundary conditions are $\\theta_0(t) = 0$ and $\\theta_{N+1}(t) = 0$.\n\n2.  **System of ODEs**: This discretization converts the partial differential equation into a system of $N$ coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n    $$\n    \\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = \\frac{\\theta_{i-1} - 2\\theta_i + \\theta_{i+1}}{h^2} + \\delta e^{\\theta_i}, \\quad i = 1, \\dots, N\n    $$\n    In vector form, let $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(t) = [\\theta_1(t), \\dots, \\theta_N(t)]^T$. The system is $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(t, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{f}(t, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{h^2}\\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + \\delta e^{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n    $$\n    Here, $e^{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is an element-wise exponential, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $N \\times N$ tridiagonal matrix representing the discrete Laplacian with homogeneous Dirichlet boundaries:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -2 & 1 & 0 & \\dots \\\\\n    1 & -2 & 1 & \\dots \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots \\\\\n    0 & \\dots & 1 & -2\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Time Integration**: The resulting ODE system is stiff, especially as a solution approaches blowup, due to the large negative eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}/h^2$ (from diffusion) and the large positive derivative of the exponential term. A stiff ODE solver, such as `Radau` or `BDF` available in `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, is required for stable and efficient integration.\n\n4.  **Blowup Detection**: To detect thermal runaway, we use an event-triggering mechanism within the ODE solver. We define an event function that monitors the maximum temperature in the domain, `event(t, y) = max(y) - Theta_th`. The solver is instructed to terminate the integration if this function crosses zero. If the integration terminates due to this event before reaching the specified maximum time $t_{max}$, we classify the outcome as blowup (`True`). Otherwise, if the integration completes to $t_{max}$, the solution is considered bounded (`False`).\n\n5.  **Numerical Safety**: To prevent floating-point overflow from the `exp` function when the solver probes large intermediate values of $\\theta$, the argument to the exponential is clipped at a value safely above the blowup threshold $\\Theta_{\\text{th}}$, ensuring this safety measure does not interfere with the detection logic.\n\nThe Python code in the final answer implements this scheme to determine the outcome for the given set of $\\delta$ values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.sparse import diags\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Frank-Kamenetskii equation for a 1D slab to detect thermal runaway.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Parameters ---\n    N = 80  # Number of interior spatial grid points\n    t_max = 15.0  # Terminal integration time\n    Theta_th = 20.0  # Blowup detection threshold\n\n    # Test cases for the dimensionless heat-release parameter delta\n    delta_values = [0.85, 0.90, 1.00]\n\n    # --- Spatial Discretization ---\n    h = 1.0 / (N + 1)  # Grid spacing\n    x = np.linspace(h, 1.0 - h, N)  # Interior grid points\n\n    # Second-order finite difference matrix for the Laplacian (A/h^2)\n    # The matrix A itself is tridiagonal with diagonals (1, -2, 1)\n    # We pre-calculate the full matrix for the ODE system, A / h^2\n    diagonals = [np.ones(N - 1), -2 * np.ones(N), np.ones(N - 1)]\n    laplacian_matrix = diags(diagonals, [-1, 0, 1]).toarray() / (h**2)\n\n    # --- Initial Condition ---\n    theta_0 = 0.1 * np.sin(np.pi * x)\n\n    # --- ODE System and Event Definition ---\n\n    def rhs(t, y, delta, lap_mat):\n        \"\"\"\n        Right-hand side of the ODE system: d(theta)/dt = f(t, theta).\n        y corresponds to the vector of temperatures theta.\n        \"\"\"\n        diffusion = lap_mat @ y\n        \n        # Numerical safety: clip the argument of exp to prevent overflow.\n        # The clip value (50.0) is well above Theta_th (20.0), so it does not\n        # interfere with the blowup detection logic.\n        reaction = delta * np.exp(np.clip(y, None, 50.0))\n        \n        return diffusion + reaction\n\n    def check_blowup(t, y, delta, lap_mat):\n        \"\"\"\n        Event function for solve_ivp.
