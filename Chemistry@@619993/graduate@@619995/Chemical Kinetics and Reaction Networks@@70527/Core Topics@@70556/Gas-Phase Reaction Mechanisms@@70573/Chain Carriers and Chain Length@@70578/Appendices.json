The termination of growing polymer chains (radicals) can occur through two primary mechanisms: combination, where two radical chains join to form a single longer chain, and disproportionation, where one radical abstracts an atom (typically hydrogen) from another, resulting in two separate, stable polymer chains.\n\nLet's define two important characteristics of this process:\n\n1.  The **Kinetic Chain Length ($\\nu$)** is defined as the ratio of the rate of propagation (i.e., monomer consumption) to the rate of initiation of new kinetic chains.\n2.

The use of mass-action kinetics and the steady-state approximation for a highly reactive intermediate ($R\\cdot$) are standard, cornerstone principles in chemical kinetics. All units are dimensionally consistent. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem requests the derivation of a closed-form expression from first principles and its subsequent numerical evaluation.

The task requires a fundamental derivation, not just formulaic recall.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, well-defined problem in chemical kinetics. I will proceed with the full derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Chain Length Expression**\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the chain length, $\\nu$, in terms of the given parameters $k_p$, $k_t$, $R_i$, and $M$. The derivation must start from the fundamental rate equations.\n\nFirst, we write the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the concentration of the chain carrier, $[R\\cdot]$. The rate of change of $[R\\cdot]$ is the sum of the rates of its formation and consumption.\n- **Formation**: The radical is formed only by the external initiation source at a constant rate $R_i$.\n- **Consumption**:\n    - For the propagation step $R\\cdot + A \\rightarrow R\\cdot + (\\text{product})$, one radical is consumed and one is produced, so the net change in $[R\\cdot]$ is zero.\n    - For the termination step $R\\cdot + R\\cdot \\rightarrow (\\text{dead product})$, two radicals are consumed per reaction event. The rate of this reaction is given as $r_t = k_t [R\\cdot]^2$. Therefore, the rate of consumption of the species $R\\cdot$ is twice the rate of the reaction, which is $2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2$.\n\nCombining these terms, the rate law for $[R\\cdot]$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt} = R_i - 2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the system is at a stationary (steady) state for $[R\\cdot]$. The steady-state approximation (SSA) implies that the concentration of the reactive intermediate is constant, i.e., its net rate of formation is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d[R\\cdot]_{ss}}{dt} = 0\n$$\nwhere $[R\\cdot]_{ss}$ denotes the steady-state concentration.\n\nApplying the SSA to the rate law:\n$$\nR_i - 2 k_t [R\\cdot]_{ss}^2 = 0\n$$\n\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $[R\\cdot]_{ss}$:\n$$\n2 k_t [R\\cdot]_{ss}^2 = R_i\n$$\n$$\n[R\\cdot]_{ss}^2 = \\frac{R_i}{2 k_t}\n$$\nSince concentration must be a non-negative quantity, we take the positive square root:\n$$\n[R\\cdot]_{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2 k_t}}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the definition of chain length $\\nu$: \"the average number of propagation events per initiation event in steady state\". This is the ratio of the rate of propagation to the rate of initiation, evaluated at steady state.\n\nThe rate of propagation is $r_p = k_p [R\\cdot][A]$. At steady state, with $[A]$ given as the constant $M$, the rate of propagation is:\n$$\nr_{p,ss} = k_p [R\\cdot]_{ss} M\n$$\n\nThe rate of initiation is given as $R_i$. Thus, the chain length $\\nu$ is:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{r_{p,ss}}{R_i} = \\frac{k_p [R\\cdot]_{ss} M}{R_i}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the derived expression for $[R\\cdot]_{ss}$ into the equation for $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{k_p M}{R_i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2 k_t}} \\right)\n$$\n\nTo simplify, we bring the term $1/R_i$ inside the square root:\n$$\n\\nu = k_p M \\sqrt{\\frac{R_i}{2 k_t R_i^2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\nu = k_p M \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2 k_t R_i}}\n$$\nThis can be written in its final closed form as:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{k_p M}{\\sqrt{2 k_t R_i}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression. It gives the dimensionless chain length $\\nu$ as a function of the system parameters $k_p$, $k_t$, $R_i$, and $M$.

The chain carrier $R$ is produced and consumed only by reactions $1$ and $2$; reaction $3$ does not involve $R$, and propagation step $4$ conserves $R$.\n\nFor reaction $1$ ($I \\rightleftharpoons 2R$), the net contribution to $a_{R}$ is $+2(r_{1,f} - r_{1,r}) = 2(k_{1} a_{I} - k_{-1} a_{R}^{2})$. For reaction $2$ ($2R \\rightleftharpoons T$), the net contribution is $+2(r_{2,r} - r_{2,f}) = 2(k_{-2} a_{T} - k_{2} a_{R}^{2})$. The quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for the chain carrier states that the net production rate of $R$ vanishes,\n$$\n0 = 2\\big(k_{1} a_{I} - k_{-1} a_{R}^{2}\\big) + 2\\big(k_{-2} a_{T} - k_{2} a_{R}^{2}\\big).\n$$\nDividing by $2$ and collecting terms in $a_{R}^{2}$ gives\n$$\n\\big(k_{-1} + k_{2}\\big) a_{R}^{2} = k_{1} a_{I} + k_{-2} a_{T},\n$$\nhence\n$$\na_{R}^{2} = \\frac{k_{1} a_{I} + k_{-2} a_{T}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}.\n$$\nWith the provided numerical values,\n$$\nk_{1} a_{I} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9},\n$$\n$$\nk_{-2} a_{T} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8},\n$$\n$$\nk_{-1} + k_{2} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = 6.0 \\times 10^{-2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\na_{R}^{2} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-9} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{1.1 \\times 10^{-8}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = 1.833\\overline{3} \\times 10^{-7},\n$$\nso\n$$\na_{R} = \\sqrt{1.833\\overline{3} \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 4.281744 \\times 10^{-4}.\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the rate of product formation by propagation. Because step $4$ conserves radicals, its rate is\n$$\nR_{p} = r_{p} = k_{p} a_{R} a_{A} = \\left(1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\right)\\left(4.281744 \\times 10^{-4}\\right)(1.0) \\approx 4.281744 \\times 10^{-1}.\n$$\n\nWe define the initiation rate $R_{i}$ as the net rate of radical formation from the initiator reservoir via reaction $1$:\n$$\nR_{i} = 2\\big(r_{1,f} - r_{1,r}\\big) = 2\\big(k_{1} a_{I} - k_{-1} a_{R}^{2}\\big).\n$$\nUsing the QSSA identity, one may also write $R_{i} = 2\\big(k_{2} a_{R}^{2} - k_{-2} a_{T}\\big)$, which is equivalent when the steady-state condition holds. Numerically,\n$$\nR_{i} = 2\\left[(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) - (1.0 \\times 10^{-2})(1.833\\overline{3} \\times 10^{-7})\\right]\n= 2\\left[1.0 \\times 10^{-9} - 1.833\\overline{3} \\times 10^{-9}\\right]\n= -1.666\\overline{6} \\times 10^{-9}.\n$$\nTherefore, the chain length\n$$\n\\nu \\equiv \\frac{R_{p}}{R_{i}} \\approx \\frac{4.281744 \\times 10^{-1}}{-1.666\\overline{6} \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx -2.569 \\times 10^{8},\n$$\nis negative. A negative chain length is unphysical because it would imply that, per net radical generated, the chain destroys product rather than forming it. The origin of this pathology is the presence of a closed reversible cycle $I \\rightleftharpoons 2R \\rightleftharpoons T \\rightleftharpoons I$ whose kinetic parameters and chemostatted activities violate the thermodynamic consistency required by detailed balance, thereby permitting a steady nonzero cycle flux that renders the “initiation” step net deactivating under the chosen conditions.\n\nTo restore consistency, we impose the Wegscheider condition for detailed balance on the closed loop. For each reversible reaction $j$, define the equilibrium constant $K_{j} = k_{j}/k_{-j}$. For a closed stoichiometric cycle in an ideal solution at fixed temperature, thermodynamic consistency requires\n$$\nK_{1} K_{2} K_{3} = 1.\n$$\nWith the given parameters,\n$$\nK_{1} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1},\n$$\n$$\nK_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-2}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2}.\n$$\nThus, detailed balance demands\n$$\nK_{3} = \\frac{1}{K_{1} K_{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\right)\\left(5.0 \\times 10^{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\times 10^{1}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}.\n$$\nSince $K_{3} = k_{3}/k_{-3}$, the corrected reverse rate constant must satisfy\n$$\nk_{-3}^{(\\mathrm{corr})} = \\frac{k_{3}}{K_{3}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures as required, the corrected value is $k_{-3}^{(\\mathrm{corr})} = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "2630599"}]}
