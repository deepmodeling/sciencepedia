It presents a classic reaction sequence often used to model enzymatic reactions (Michaelis-Menten kinetics, in a simplified form) or other complex reactions involving an intermediate. All necessary components—the elementary steps, the rate constants, and the approximation method—are provided. The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles of chemistry or mathematics. The tasks are logical and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the intermediate species, $I$, is determined by the rates of the elementary steps in which it participates. According to the law of mass action:\n- The rate of formation of $I$ from $A$ and $B$ is $k_{1}[A][B]$.\n- The rate of decomposition of $I$ back to $A$ and $B$ is $k_{-1}[I]$.\n- The rate of conversion of $I$ to product $P$ is $k_{2}[I]$.\n\nThe net rate of change of the concentration of $I$ is therefore given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - k_{-1}[I] - k_{2}[I]\n$$\n\nThe steady-state approximation (SSA) posits that for a highly reactive, low-concentration intermediate, its rate of formation is approximately equal to its rate of consumption. Mathematically, this implies that its net rate of change is effectively zero: $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this approximation to the equation for $[I]$:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] - k_{-1}[I]_{\\text{ss}} - k_{2}[I]_{\\text{ss}} = 0\n$$\nwhere $[I]_{\\text{ss}}$ denotes the steady-state concentration of the intermediate. We can now solve this algebraic equation for $[I]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] = (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I]_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\n$$\n[I]_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nThe rate of formation of the product, $r_{P}$, is given by the final elementary step, $I \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P$. Applying the law of mass action to this step gives:\n$$\nr_{P} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[I]\n$$\nTo obtain the overall rate law in terms of the reactant concentrations, we substitute the steady-state concentration $[I]_{\\text{ss}}$ into the expression for $r_{P}$:\n$$\nr_{P} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A][B]\n$$\nThis is the closed-form rate law under the steady-state approximation.\n\nThe problem defines an effective second-order rate coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, by the relation $r_{P} = k_{\\mathrm{eff}}[A][B]$. By direct comparison with the derived rate law, we can identify $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nThis expression constitutes the required final answer.\n\nFor completeness, we analyze the two limiting kinetic regimes as requested.\n\n**Regime 1: $k_{-1} \\gg k_{2}$ (Pre-equilibrium)**\nIn this limit, the rate of decomposition of the intermediate $I$ back to reactants $A$ and $B$ is much faster than its conversion to product $P$. The denominator of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ becomes $k_{-1} + k_{2} \\approx k_{-1}$. The effective rate coefficient simplifies to:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}\n$$\nThe physical interpretation is that the first step, $A + B \\rightleftharpoons I$, reaches a rapid equilibrium. The overall rate of reaction is then determined by the slower, rate-determining step, which is the conversion of the equilibrated intermediate to product, $I \\to P$. The ratio $\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}$ is the equilibrium constant $K_{1}$ for the first step. The overall rate constant is thus a product of this equilibrium constant and the rate constant of the slow step, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = K_{1}k_{2}$.\n\n**Regime 2: $k_{2} \\gg k_{-1}$ (Rate-determining formation)**\nIn this limit, the rate of conversion of the intermediate $I$ to product $P$ is much faster than its decomposition back to reactants. Any intermediate formed is immediately consumed to form product. The denominator of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ becomes $k_{-1} + k_{2} \\approx k_{2}$. The effective rate coefficient simplifies to:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{2}} = k_{1}\n$$\nThe physical interpretation is that the formation of the intermediate, $A + B \\to I$, is the slow, rate-determining step of the overall reaction. Once the intermediate $I$ is formed, it proceeds to product $P$ very quickly, so the overall rate is dictated entirely by the rate of the first step. The reaction rate is simply $r_{P} \\approx k_{1}[A][B]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2667560"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are only as good as their ability to predict experimental reality.

Use appropriate dimensionless groupings of parameters and concentrations, defined from first principles, to diagnose which approximation is more consistent with the data.\n\nWhich option best reflects the correct diagnosis and justification?\n\nA. Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA) is more consistent, because the binding and unbinding are much faster than catalysis across the investigated $[A]_{0}$, so $AC$ maintains equilibrium with $A$ and $C$; the observed non-integer order arises from saturation. The dimensionless binding-to-catalysis ratio is large, and the kinetic constants imply $K_{\\mathrm{app}}$ closely matches the equilibrium dissociation constant.\n\nB. Steady-State Approximation (SSA) is more consistent, because the catalyst is present at vanishingly small fractional saturation relative to substrate on the scale of the characteristic concentration, ensuring $d[AC]/dt \\approx 0$ after a short transient; the observed non-integer order arises from partial saturation of the catalytic sites. A dimensionless small parameter $\\varepsilon = [C]_{T}/(K + [A]_{0}) \\ll 1$ holds over the range, and the kinetic $K_{\\mathrm{app}}$ extracted from $V_{\\max}$ and the low-$[A]$ slope matches the SSA prediction rather than the pre-equilibrium dissociation constant.\n\nC. Both approximations are equally consistent and strictly indistinguishable given the reported data, because any non-integer order in $[A]$ necessarily implies a Michaelis-type rate law with the same apparent constant under both approximations; dimensionless groupings are inconclusive.\n\nD. Neither approximation is consistent, because a non-integer order in $[A]$ necessarily indicates a radical chain mechanism rather than a single-intermediate catalytic mechanism, so neither SSA nor PEA can apply here.", "solution": "The problem requires a critical comparison of the Steady-State Approximation (SSA) and the Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA) for a given catalytic mechanism, based on a set of kinetic data.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Mechanism: $A + C \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} AC \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P + C$\n-   Rate Constants:\n    -   $k_{1} = 4.0\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n    -   $k_{-1} = 4.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n    -   $k_{2} = 4.0\\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   Concentrations:\n    -   Total catalyst: $[C]_{T} = 5.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n    -   Initial substrate: $[A]_{0} \\in [1.0\\times 10^{-6},\\,1.0\\times 10^{-3}]\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n-   Experimental Observations:\n    -   Initial rate $v_{0}$ is linear in $[C]_{T}$.\n    -   Saturated rate at high $[A]_{0}$: $V_{\\max} = 2.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}$\n    -   Low $[A]_{0}$ behavior ($[A]_{0}\\le 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$): Linear fit of $v_{0}$ vs. $[A]_{0}$ has slope $m = 1.80\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n    -   Intermediate $[A]_{0}$ behavior ($[A]_{0}\\in [1.0\\times 10^{-5},\\,1.0\\times 10^{-4}]\\ \\mathrm{M}$): Apparent order $n_{A}\\approx 0.6$.\n-   Constraint: Total catalyst conservation $[C]_{T} = [C] + [AC]$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem describes a standard Michaelis-Menten type catalytic mechanism. All concepts (law of mass action, SSA, PEA) are fundamental to chemical kinetics. The given values for concentrations and rate constants are physically plausible. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard task of model discrimination using experimental data. Let me perform a preliminary consistency check. The existence of a non-integer reaction order is a natural consequence of this mechanism, as the order with respect to substrate is expected to vary from $1$ to $0$ with increasing concentration. The provided data appears internally consistent and sufficient for a quantitative analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Rate Laws**\n\nThe rate of product formation is given by the law of mass action for the second step:\n$$v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[AC]$$\nThe concentration of the intermediate, $[AC]$, is found by applying an approximation to its rate equation:\n$$\\frac{d[AC]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][C] - k_{-1}[AC] - k_{2}[AC]$$\nUsing the conservation of catalyst, $[C] = [C]_{T} - [AC]$, we can write:\n$$\\frac{d[AC]}{dt} = k_{1}[A]([C]_{T} - [AC]) - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[AC]$$\n\n**1. Steady-State Approximation (SSA)**\nThe SSA assumes that the concentration of the intermediate $[AC]$ is small and its rate of change is negligible after a short induction period, i.e., $\\frac{d[AC]}{dt} \\approx 0$. This is generally valid when $[C]_T$ is much smaller than the substrate concentration scale, i.e., $[C]_T \\ll K_M + [A]_0$.\nSetting $\\frac{d[AC]}{dt} = 0$:\n$$k_{1}[A][C]_{T} = (k_{1}[A] + k_{-1} + k_{2})[AC]_{ss}$$\n$$[AC]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{1}[A][C]_{T}}{k_{1}[A] + k_{-1} + k_{2}} = \\frac{[A][C]_{T}}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{1}} + [A]}$$\nThe initial rate, $v_{0}$, where $[A] = [A]_{0}$, is:\n$$v_{0} = k_{2}[AC]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{2}[C]_{T}[A]_{0}}{K_{M} + [A]_{0}}$$\nwhere the Michaelis constant under SSA is $K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_1}$. The maximum rate is $V_{max} = k_2[C]_T$.\n\n**2. Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA)**\nThe PEA assumes that the first step is a rapid, reversible equilibrium which is established much faster than the second, product-forming step proceeds. This is valid when $k_{-1}[AC] \\gg k_2[AC]$, or simply $k_{-1} \\gg k_{2}$. The equilibrium condition is $k_{1}[A][C] \\approx k_{-1}[AC]$.\nThis defines the dissociation constant $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1} = \\frac{[A][C]}{[AC]}$.\nUsing $[C] = [C]_T - [AC]$, we solve for $[AC]$:\n$$[AC] = \\frac{[A][C]_{T}}{K_{d} + [A]}$$\nThe initial rate is:\n$$v_{0} = k_{2}[AC] = \\frac{k_{2}[C]_{T}[A]_{0}}{K_{d} + [A]_{0}}$$\nThis has the same form, but with an apparent Michaelis constant $K_{app} = K_{d} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1}$. The maximum rate $V_{max} = k_2[C]_T$ is identical to the SSA expression.\n\n**Quantitative Comparison**\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical parameters from the given rate constants and compare them with the experimental data.\n-   $k_{1} = 4.0\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $k_{-1} = 4.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   $k_{2} = 4.0\\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n-   $[C]_{T} = 5.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\n**Theoretical Predictions:**\n-   **Maximum Rate ($V_{max}$):** Both approximations predict $V_{max} = k_{2}[C]_T$.\n    $$V_{max, theory} = (4.0\\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(5.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}$$\n    This is in perfect agreement with the experimental value $V_{max, exp} = 2.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}$. This result does not help distinguish between the two approximations.\n\n-   **Apparent Michaelis Constant ($K_{app}$):**\n    -   SSA predicts: $K_{M} = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_1} = \\frac{4.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 4.0\\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{4.0\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{4.4\\times 10^{3}}{4.0\\times 10^{7}}\\ \\mathrm{M} = 1.1\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n    -   PEA predicts: $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_1} = \\frac{4.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{4.0\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Data:**\nThe rate law at low substrate concentration ($[A]_{0} \\ll K_{app}$) is $v_{0} \\approx \\frac{V_{max}}{K_{app}}[A]_{0}$. The slope of $v_{0}$ vs. $[A]_{0}$ is $m = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_{app}}$. We can extract an experimental value for $K_{app}$ using the given experimental slope $m_{exp}$ and $V_{max, exp}$.\n$$K_{app, exp} = \\frac{V_{max, exp}}{m_{exp}} = \\frac{2.00\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}}{1.80\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 1.11\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   Experimental value: $K_{app, exp} \\approx 1.11\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n-   SSA prediction: $K_{M} = 1.1\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n-   PEA prediction: $K_{d} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe experimental value for the apparent Michaelis constant is in excellent agreement with the value predicted by the SSA, with a relative difference of less than $1\\%$. The PEA prediction differs by about $10\\%$. This provides strong quantitative evidence that the SSA is more consistent with the data.\n\n**Dimensionless Analysis:**\nThe validity of the PEA rests on the assumption $k_{-1} \\gg k_{2}$. The dimensionless ratio is $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1}} = \\frac{4.0\\times 10^{2}}{4.0\\times 10^{3}} = 0.1$. This value is small but not negligible, which explains why PEA is a reasonable but not highly accurate approximation. The SSA value is related to the PEA value by $K_M = K_d(1 + k_2/k_{-1})$. The data shows that this correction factor of $1.1$ is indeed necessary to match the experiment.\n\nThe validity of the SSA itself is justified by the condition $[C]_T \\ll K_M + [A]_0$. We can define a dimensionless parameter $\\varepsilon = \\frac{[C]_T}{K_M + [A]_0}$.\nTaking $K_M \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$ and $[C]_T = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, for the lowest $[A]_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, we have:\n$$\\varepsilon = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.1 \\times 10^{-4} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.11 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 4.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1$$\nThe condition is robustly satisfied across the entire experimental range for $[A]_0$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA) is more consistent...**\nThis statement is incorrect. The quantitative analysis shows the opposite: SSA is more consistent. While binding/unbinding ($k_1, k_{-1}$) are faster than catalysis ($k_2$), the condition $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$ is not met strongly enough for PEA to be more accurate than the more general SSA. The experimentally determined apparent constant $K_{\\mathrm{app}} \\approx 1.11\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$ does not closely match the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Steady-State Approximation (SSA) is more consistent...**\nThis statement is correct. The justification provided aligns with our analysis.\n1. The condition for SSA, corresponding to the dimensionless parameter $\\varepsilon = [C]_{T}/(K + [A]_{0}) \\ll 1$, is satisfied. This ensures that $d[AC]/dt \\approx 0$ is a valid assumption.\n2. The observed non-integer order is correctly attributed to partial saturation, a feature of the Michaelis-Menten rate law derived from SSA.\n3. Crucially, the kinetic constant $K_{\\mathrm{app}}$ extracted from the experimental data ($1.11\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$) quantitatively matches the SSA prediction for $K_M$ ($1.1\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$) and not the PEA prediction for $K_d$ ($1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$).\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Both approximations are equally consistent and strictly indistinguishable...**\nThis statement is incorrect. The data is sufficiently precise to distinguish between the two approximations. The $10\\%$ difference between the PEA prediction and the observed data is significant and resolvable, ruling out that they are \"equally consistent\".\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither approximation is consistent, because a non-integer order in $[A]$ necessarily indicates a radical chain mechanism...**\nThis statement is incorrect. The premise is false. Non-integer reaction orders are common in multi-step reaction mechanisms, including enzymatic and catalytic cycles, and are explicitly predicted by both SSA and PEA for the given mechanism.

To show that it is a quadratic in $C$, we expand the equation:\n$$ k_{1}(E_{T}S_{T} - E_{T}C - S_{T}C + C^{2}) - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})C = 0 $$\n$$ k_{1}C^{2} - (k_{1}E_{T} + k_{1}S_{T})C - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})C + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} = 0 $$\nRearranging into the standard quadratic form $aC^{2} + bC + c = 0$, we have:\n$$ k_{1}C^{2} - \\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)C + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} = 0 $$\nThe coefficients are:\n$a = k_{1}$\n$b = -\\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)$\n$c = k_{1}E_{T}S_{T}$\n\nThe two roots for $C$ are given by the quadratic formula, $C = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ C_{\\pm} = \\frac{k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)^{2} - 4k_{1}^{2}E_{T}S_{T}}}{2k_{1}} $$\nTo identify the physically admissible root, we must enforce the physical constraints: concentrations cannot be negative. This requires $C \\ge 0$, $[E] = E_{T} - C \\ge 0 \\implies C \\le E_{T}$, and $[S] = S_{T} - C \\ge 0 \\implies C \\le S_{T}$. Together, these constraints demand that the solution satisfies $0 \\le C \\le \\min\\{E_{T}, S_{T}\\}$.\n\nLet's analyze the quadratic function $f(C) = k_{1}C^{2} - \\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)C + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T}$. Since $k_{1} > 0$, this is a parabola opening upwards.\nWe evaluate the function at the boundaries of the physical domain for $C$:\nAt $C=0$:\n$$ f(0) = k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} $$\nSince $k_{1} > 0$, $E_{T} > 0$, and $S_{T} \\ge 0$ (as it is a sum of concentrations), we have $f(0) \\ge 0$.\nAt $C=E_{T}$:\n$$ f(E_{T}) = k_{1}E_{T}^{2} - \\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)E_{T} + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} $$\n$$ f(E_{T}) = k_{1}E_{T}^{2} - k_{1}E_{T}^{2} - k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})E_{T} + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} = -(k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})E_{T} $$\nSince $k_{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, and $E_T$ are strictly positive, $f(E_{T}) < 0$.\nAt $C=S_{T}$:\n$$ f(S_{T}) = k_{1}S_{T}^{2} - \\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)S_{T} + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} $$\n$$ f(S_{T}) = k_{1}S_{T}^{2} - k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} - k_{1}S_{T}^{2} - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})S_{T} + k_{1}E_{T}S_{T} = -(k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})S_{T} $$\nSince $k_{-1}, k_{\\mathrm{cat}} > 0$ and $S_{T} \\ge 0$, we have $f(S_{T}) \\le 0$.\n\nThe function $f(C)$ is a parabola opening upwards. It is non-negative at $C=0$ and non-positive at both $C=E_{T}$ and $C=S_{T}$ (and therefore at $C=\\min\\{E_{T}, S_{T}\\}$). This proves that one root must lie in the interval $[0, \\min\\{E_{T}, S_{T}\\}]$ and the other root must be greater than $\\max\\{E_{T}, S_{T}\\}$. The smaller root, $C_{-}$, is the physically admissible solution. The larger root, $C_{+}$, would lead to non-physical negative concentrations for either $[E]$ or $[S]$.\n\nThe dynamics of the slow variable $S_T$ are found by summing the rate equations for $[S]$ and $[ES]$:\n$$ \\frac{dS_{T}}{dt} = \\frac{d[S]}{dt} + \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = \\left(-k_{1}[E][S] + k_{-1}[ES]\\right) + \\left(k_{1}[E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES]\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES] = -k_{\\mathrm{cat}}C $$\nThe system is thus reduced to the one-dimensional dynamics $\\frac{dS_{T}}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{cat}}C(S_{T}, E_{T})$, where $C(S_{T}, E_{T})$ is the physically admissible root derived above.\n\nThe explicit algebraic expression for the physically admissible concentration $C$ is the smaller root, $C_{-}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} - \\sqrt{\\left(k_{1}(E_{T} + S_{T}) + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}\\right)^{2} - 4k_{1}^{2}E_{T}S_{T}}}{2k_{1}} } $$", "id": "2626965"}]}
