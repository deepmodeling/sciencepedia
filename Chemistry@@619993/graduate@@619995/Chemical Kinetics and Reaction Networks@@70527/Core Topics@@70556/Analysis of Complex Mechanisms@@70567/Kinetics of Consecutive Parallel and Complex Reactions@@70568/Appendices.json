In the stated regime and with the given time resolution, the observed $[C](t)$ appears as a single-exponential rise governed by an apparent first-order rate equal to the slow-step rate $k_2$ multiplied by the equilibrium fraction of $B$ within the $\\{A,B\\}$ pool; therefore, from $[C](t)$ alone one cannot separate $k_2$ from the $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ equilibrium partitioning.**\nAs derived above, $[C](t)$ follows a single-exponential rise with an apparent rate constant $k_{app} = k_2 \\cdot f_B$, where $f_B = \\frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_{-1}}$ is precisely the equilibrium fraction of $B$ in the $\\{A,B\\}$ pool. An experiment measuring $[C](t)$ yields only the product $k_2 \\cdot f_B$. One cannot determine $k_2$ and $f_B$ (which represents the equilibrium partitioning) separately from this single observable parameter. The statement is a correct description of the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A rapid-relaxation perturbation (for example, a small temperature jump about equilibrium) that measures both the relaxation time of $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ and its equilibrium constant, together with the slow-timescale measurement of $[C](t)$, is sufficient to uniquely determine $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$.**\nThis option proposes a second, independent experiment.\n1. The slow measurement of $[C](t)$ yields $k_{app} = k_2 \\frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_{-1}}$.\n2. A rapid-relaxation experiment on the $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ equilibrium measures two quantities:\n   a. The equilibrium constant, $K_{eq} = k_1 / k_{-1}$.\n   b. The relaxation time, $\\tau_{relax} = (k_1 + k_{-1})^{-1}$.\nFrom the relaxation experiment (2), we have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$:\n$k_1/k_{-1} = K_{eq}$ and $k_1 + k_{-1} = 1/\\tau_{relax}$. This system can be solved uniquely for $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$. For example, $k_1 = \\frac{K_{eq}}{\\tau_{relax}(1+K_{eq})}$ and $k_{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{relax}(1+K_{eq})}$.\nOnce $k_1$ and $k_{-1}$ are known, we can use the result from the slow measurement (1) to solve for $k_2$:\n$k_2 = k_{app} / \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_{-1}} \\right)$. Since all terms on the right-hand side are now known, $k_2$ is uniquely determined.\nTherefore, the combination of these two experiments is sufficient to determine all three rate constants.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Changing the initial concentration $A_0$ while still recording only $[C](t)$ does not break the degeneracy between the $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ equilibrium partitioning and $k_2$.**\nThe kinetic trace is described by $[C](t) = A_0 (1 - e^{-k_{app} t})$. The apparent rate constant is $k_{app} = k_2 \\frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_{-1}}$. As long as the kinetics are truly first-order in the reactants (as per the law of mass action for elementary steps), the rate constants $k_1, k_{-1}, k_2$ are independent of concentration. Thus, $k_{app}$ is also independent of the initial concentration $A_0$. Performing the experiment at different initial concentrations will yield different amplitudes of the signal ($A_0$) but will result in the same measured apparent rate constant $k_{app}$. No new information is gained about the individual components of $k_{app}$, and the degeneracy remains.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Varying temperature and measuring only $[C](t)$, without any additional observable or model for how parameters depend on temperature, always suffices to uniquely recover the separate temperature dependences of $k_2(T)$ and the $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ equilibrium constant.**\nFrom measuring $[C](t)$ at various temperatures $T$, one obtains the temperature dependence of the apparent rate constant, $k_{app}(T)$. We have the relation:\n$k_{app}(T) = k_2(T) \\cdot f_B(T) = k_2(T) \\frac{K_{eq}(T)}{1+K_{eq}(T)}$.\nThis is a single equation, $k_{app}(T) = g(k_2(T), K_{eq}(T))$, relating two unknown functions, $k_2(T)$ and $K_{eq}(T)$. Without any additional information or assumptions (such as a priori models like the Arrhenius and van 't Hoff equations for the temperature dependence of $k_2$ and $K_{eq}$, respectively), it is mathematically impossible to uniquely \"unmix\" the single measured function $k_{app}(T)$ into its two constituent functions. There are infinitely many pairs of functions $(k_2(T), K_{eq}(T))$ that could yield the same product function $k_{app}(T)$. The word \"always\" makes the statement definitively false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If one can pre-equilibrate $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ with $k_2$ effectively $0$, then trigger $k_2$ at $t=0$ (for example, by rapidly adding a catalyst or by photochemical activation), and simultaneously measure $[B](t)$, one can determine $k_2$ from the initial rate of $C$ formation.**\nThis option proposes a specific experimental design.\n1. Pre-equilibration: At $t<0$, the system $A \\rightleftharpoons B$ is at equilibrium with a total concentration $A_0$. The initial concentrations for the kinetic run are $[A](0)=[A]_{eq}$ and $[B](0)=[B]_{eq}$.\n2. Trigger: At $t=0$, the reaction $B \\to C$ is initiated.\n3. Measurement: The rate of formation of $C$ is given by $d[C]/dt = k_2 [B]$. The initial rate, at $t=0^+$, is $(d[C]/dt)_{t=0} = k_2 [B](0)$.\nTo determine $k_2$, one needs to measure both the initial rate of $C$ formation, $(d[C]/dt)_{t=0}$, and the initial concentration of reactant $B$, which is $[B](0)$. The option states that one can \"simultaneously measure $[B](t)$\", which provides the value of $[B](0)$. The initial rate of $C$ formation can be found from the initial slope of a $[C](t)$ measurement. With both quantities measured, $k_2$ can be calculated as $k_2 = \\frac{(d[C]/dt)_{t=0}}{[B](0)}$. The proposed experimental design is sound and indeed allows for the determination of $k_2$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. In the fast-equilibrium regime, applying the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) to $B$ yields an effective $A \\to C$ rate proportional to $k_1 k_2/k_{-1}$ that correctly reproduces the observed $[C](t)$ in general.**\nThe QSSA applied to the intermediate $B$ assumes $d[B]/dt \\approx 0$:\n$k_1 [A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[B] \\approx 0 \\implies [B]_{QSSA} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2} [A]$.\nThe rate of formation of C becomes $d[C]/dt = k_2 [B]_{QSSA} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2} [A]$. This gives an effective rate constant $k_{eff, QSSA} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}$ for a process $A \\to C$.\nThe correct approximation for the specified regime ($k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$) is the Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA), which yields an apparent rate constant $k_{app, PEA} = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_{-1}}$.\nThese two expressions, $k_{eff, QSSA}$ and $k_{app, PEA}$, are not equal in general. For QSSA to be valid, B must be a highly reactive intermediate, which typically requires its consumption rates to be much larger than its formation rate ($k_{-1}+k_2 \\gg k_1$). The problem's PEA regime ($k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$) does not guarantee this condition. For instance, if $k_1 \\gg k_{-1} \\gg k_2$, the PEA gives $k_{app} \\approx k_2$, while QSSA gives $k_{eff} \\approx k_2 k_1/k_{-1} = k_2 K_{eq} \\gg k_2$. The two approximations give vastly different results. The QSSA only agrees with the PEA in the specific sub-regime were $k_{-1} \\gg k_1 \\gg k_2$. Since the statement claims correctness \"in general\" for the fast-equilibrium regime, and we have found a clear counterexample within this regime, the statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "2650901"}, {"introduction": "The quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) is one of the most widely used tools for simplifying complex kinetic models, but its validity depends on subtle conditions.

Therefore,\n$$0 \\leq [B]_{0} - [B](t) \\leq [A]_{0},$$\nso the relative change in $[B]$ satisfies\n$$\\frac{|[B](t) - [B]_{0}|}{[B]_{0}} \\leq \\frac{[A]_{0}}{[B]_{0}} \\ll 1.$$\nThus, to leading order in $[A]_{0}/[B]_{0}$, it is self-consistent to treat $[B](t) \\approx [B]_{0}$ as a constant during the transient of $[I](t)$. Define the pseudo-first-order rate constant\n$$k_{1}' \\equiv k_{1}[B]_{0},$$\nso that the reduced ODEs become\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_{1}'[A],\\quad \\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{1}'[A] - k_{2}[I],$$\nwith $[A](0) = [A]_{0}$ and $[I](0) = 0$.\n\nSolving the first equation gives\n$$[A](t) = [A]_{0}\\exp(-k_{1}' t).$$\nSubstitute into the $[I](t)$ equation to obtain a linear, inhomogeneous ODE:\n$$\\frac{d[I]}{dt} + k_{2}[I] = k_{1}'[A]_{0}\\exp(-k_{1}' t).$$\nWith integrating factor $\\exp(k_{2} t)$ and $[I](0) = 0$, the exact solution is\n$$[I](t) = \\frac{k_{1}'[A]_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}\\left[\\exp(-k_{1}' t) - \\exp(-k_{2} t)\\right],\\quad k_{2} \\neq k_{1}'.$$\n\nTo find the maximum of $[I](t)$, differentiate and set to zero:\n$$\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{1}'[A]_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}\\left[-k_{1}'\\exp(-k_{1}' t) + k_{2}\\exp(-k_{2} t)\\right] = 0.$$\nHence the peak time $t^{\\ast}$ satisfies\n$$k_{1}'\\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast}) = k_{2}\\exp(-k_{2} t^{\\ast}),$$\nwhich rearranges to\n$$\\exp\\left[(k_{2} - k_{1}') t^{\\ast}\\right] = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}'}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad t^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}'}\\right).$$\nEvaluating $[I](t)$ at $t^{\\ast}$, it is convenient to use the identity\n$$\\exp(-k_{2} t^{\\ast}) = \\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast})\\exp\\!\\left[-(k_{2} - k_{1}') t^{\\ast}\\right] = \\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast})\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}.$$\nThus\n$$[I]_{\\max} = [I](t^{\\ast}) = \\frac{k_{1}'[A]_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}\\left[\\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast}) - \\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast})\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}\\right] = \\frac{k_{1}'[A]_{0}}{k_{2}}\\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast}).$$\nUsing $t^{\\ast}$ above,\n$$\\exp(-k_{1}' t^{\\ast}) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}\\ln\\!\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}'}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}'}\\right)^{-\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}}.$$\nTherefore,\n$$[I]_{\\max} = [A]_{0}\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}\\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}'}\\right)^{-\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}} = [A]_{0}\\left(\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}}.$$\n\nNext, apply the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for $I$ by setting $d[I]/dt \\approx 0$ in the $I$-equation:\n$$0 \\approx k_{1}'[A](t) - k_{2}[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}(t)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad [I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}(t) \\approx \\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}[A](t) = \\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}[A]_{0}\\exp(-k_{1}' t).$$\nSince $[A](t)$ is monotonically decreasing, the QSSA curve attains its maximum at $t = 0$:\n$$[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA},\\max} = \\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2}}[A]_{0}.$$\n\nIntroduce the dimensionless parameter\n$$\\varepsilon \\equiv \\frac{k_{1}' }{k_{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}[B]_{0}}{k_{2}}.$$\nThen the ratio of the exact maximum to the QSSA maximum is\n$$R(\\varepsilon) \\equiv \\frac{[I]_{\\max}}{[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA},\\max}} = \\frac{[A]_{0}\\,\\varepsilon^{\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}}}{[A]_{0}\\,\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon^{\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{2} - k_{1}'} - 1} = \\varepsilon^{\\frac{k_{1}'}{k_{2} - k_{1}'}} = \\varepsilon^{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 - \\varepsilon}}.$$\n\nNow evaluate at $\\varepsilon = 0.9$:\n$$R(0.9) = 0.9^{\\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.9}} = 0.9^{9}.$$\nCompute $0.9^{9} = 0.387420489\\ldots$, which rounded to four significant figures is $0.3874$.\n\nFinally, the dynamical reason for QSSA failure in this setting, despite a naive statement such as $k_{1} \\ll k_{2}$, is that the effective formation rate of $I$ is governed by the pseudo-first-order constant $k_{1}' = k_{1}[B]_{0}$. When $[B]_{0}$ is large, the dimensionless ratio $\\varepsilon = k_{1}[B]_{0}/k_{2}$ can be of order unity, so the production and consumption of $I$ occur on comparable time scales. In this regime, $[I](t)$ exhibits a pronounced transient with $d[I]/dt \\neq 0$ except at its peak; enforcing $d[I]/dt \\approx 0$ globally (QSSA) overestimates the intermediate, as quantified by $R(0.9) \\approx 0.3874$. A concrete, scientifically plausible parameter set that realizes $\\varepsilon \\approx 0.9$ with $[A]_{0} \\ll [B]_{0}$ and a numerically smaller $k_{1}$ than $k_{2}$ is, for example, $k_{1} = 1.1\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{2} = 1.0\\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $[B]_{0} = 8.18\\ \\mathrm{M}$, and $[A]_{0} = 5.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$, for which $\\varepsilon \\approx 0.9$ and $[A]_{0}/[B]_{0} \\approx 6.1\\times 10^{-5}$. This counterexample shows that ignoring the large co-reactant concentration in the timescale comparison leads directly to QSSA breakdown.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3874}$$", "id": "2650870"}]}
