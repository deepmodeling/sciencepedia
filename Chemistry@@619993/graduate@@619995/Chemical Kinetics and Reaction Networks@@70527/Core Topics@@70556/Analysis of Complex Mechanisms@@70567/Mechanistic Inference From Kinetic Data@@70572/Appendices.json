It presents a standard problem in the analysis of chemical reaction networks based on kinetic data. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe system is described by the set of ordinary differential equations $\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = S v(x(t))$, where $x(t) = (A(t), B(t), C(t))^{\\top}$ is the vector of species concentrations, $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times r}$ is the stoichiometric matrix, and $v(x)$ is the vector of reaction rates.\n\n1.  **Inference of the Linear Conservation Law**\n\n    An experimental observation is that the quantity $A(t) + B(t) + 2C(t)$ remains constant over time. A linear conservation law is a function of the form $L(x) = l^{\\top}x = \\text{constant}$ for some constant vector $l$. From the given information, this law is $L(x) = 1 \\cdot A(t) + 1 \\cdot B(t) + 2 \\cdot C(t)$. The coefficient vector is therefore $l = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    For this quantity to be conserved, its time derivative must be zero:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{dt} (l^{\\top}x(t)) = 0 $$\n    Using the chain rule, this becomes:\n    $$ l^{\\top}\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 $$\n    Substituting the governing equation of the system, we have:\n    $$ l^{\\top} S v(x) = 0 $$\n    This equation must hold for all times $t \\ge 0$ and for all initial conditions, which implies it must hold for all valid non-negative reaction rate vectors $v(x)$ that the system can exhibit. The only way for this to be true for an arbitrary functional form of $v(x) \\ge 0$ (consistent with mass-action kinetics) is if the row vector $l^{\\top}S$ is identically the zero vector:\n    $$ l^{\\top}S = 0^{\\top} $$\n    This indicates that the vector $l$ is an element of the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix $S$.\n\n2.  **Constraint on the Columns of the Stoichiometric Matrix S**\n\n    The relation $l^{\\top}S = 0^{\\top}$ implies that the vector $l$ is orthogonal to every column vector of $S$. Let $s \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ be any one of the $r$ column vectors of $S$. Each such column represents the net change in concentrations for a particular reaction. The constraint on each column $s = (s_A, s_B, s_C)^{\\top}$ is given by the dot product:\n    $$ l^{\\top}s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s_A \\\\ s_B \\\\ s_C \\end{pmatrix} = s_A + s_B + 2s_C = 0 $$\n    This equation defines a plane in the $3$-dimensional species space. Any valid stoichiometry vector for a reaction in this network must lie within this plane.\n\n    To express the general form of such a column vector $s$, we can parameterize the vectors in this plane. We can choose two of the components as free parameters, for example, $s_A = \\alpha_1$ and $s_B = \\alpha_2$, where $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are arbitrary scalar parameters. The third component, $s_C$, is then determined by the constraint:\n    $$ s_C = -\\frac{1}{2}(s_A + s_B) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_2 $$\n    Thus, the general form of a column vector $s$ of the matrix $S$ is:\n    $$ s = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_1 \\\\ \\alpha_2 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    for any scalars $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Rank of S**\n\n    The rank of the stoichiometric matrix, $\\text{rank}(S)$, is the dimension of the subspace spanned by its columns (the column space, or image, of $S$).\n    \n    From Part 1, we established that there exists a non-zero vector $l = (1, 1, 2)^{\\top}$ in the left null space of $S$. The dimension of the left null space, $\\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S^{\\top}))$, is therefore at least $1$. The rank-nullity theorem states that $\\text{rank}(S) + \\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S^{\\top})) = n$, where $n=3$ is the number of species.\n    Therefore, we can constrain the rank:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(S) = 3 - \\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S^{\\top})) \\le 3 - 1 = 2 $$\n    The rank of $S$ is at most $2$.\n\n    Since reactions are occurring, evidenced by \"time-course experiments\", the concentrations are not static. This means $\\frac{dx}{dt} \\neq 0$, which implies that $S$ cannot be the zero matrix. Thus, $\\text{rank}(S) \\ge 1$.\n\n    We must now distinguish between $\\text{rank}(S)=1$ and $\\text{rank}(S)=2$. If $\\text{rank}(S) = 1$, all column vectors of $S$ must be scalar multiples of a single basis vector, say $s^*$. The matrix $S$ could then be written as $S = s^* c^{\\top}$ for some vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^r$. The system dynamics would be:\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = S v(x) = (s^* c^{\\top})v(x) = s^*(c^{\\top}v(x)) $$\n    The expression $c^{\\top}v(x)$ is a scalar function of time, let us call it $\\kappa(t)$. Then $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\kappa(t) s^*$. This equation mandates that the reaction velocity vector $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ at any time $t$ must be parallel to the fixed vector $s^*$. The solution trajectory $x(t) = x(0) + s^* \\int_0^t \\kappa(\\tau)d\\tau$ would trace a straight line in the concentration space. This directly contradicts the experimental finding that \"the trajectories are not confined to a single line\".\n\n    Additionally, if $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\kappa(t)s^*$, where $s^* = (s_A^*, s_B^*, s_C^*)^{\\top}$, then the rates of change of species are always proportional: $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\kappa(t)s_A^*$ and $\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\kappa(t)s_B^*$. Their ratio, $\\frac{dA/dt}{dB/dt} = \\frac{s_A^*}{s_B^*}$, would be a constant (assuming $s_B^* \\neq 0$). This contradicts the observation that \"instantaneous rates $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dB}{dt}$ are not always proportional to each other\".\n\n    Therefore, the case $\\text{rank}(S) = 1$ is inconsistent with the data.\n\n    Given that $\\text{rank}(S) \\ge 1$, $\\text{rank}(S) \\neq 1$, and $\\text{rank}(S) \\le 2$, and that the rank must be an integer, the only possible value is $2$. A rank of $2$ implies that the column space of $S$ is a $2$-dimensional plane. This is consistent with the velocity vectors $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ being confined to a plane (specifically, the plane orthogonal to $l=(1,1,2)^{\\top}$), but not being restricted to a single direction within that plane, thus allowing for curved trajectories.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2654903"}, {"introduction": "The time course of a reaction is a rich tapestry of information, often revealing distinct phases that correspond to different underlying physical processes.

The problem is self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined problem in chemical kinetics that can be solved by applying fundamental principles. I will now proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe provided kinetic trace for product formation, $P(t)$, consists of two distinct components:\n1.  A pre-steady-state \"burst\" phase described by the term $A\\left(1 - e^{-t/\\tau}\\right)$. This phase is characterized by a rapid, exponential formation of product with a timescale $\\tau$ and an amplitude $A$.\n2.  A steady-state phase described by the term $v_{\\mathrm{ss}}\\,t$. This phase begins after the burst is complete (for $t \\gg \\tau$) and is characterized by a constant rate of product formation, $v_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n\nLet us analyze the information conveyed by the parameters.\n\nThe simplest kinetic scheme that can account for a pre-steady-state burst is one involving at least two steps, where the first step leads to the rapid formation of an intermediate which then turns over in a slower, rate-limiting step to form the product. Consider the minimal model:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} I \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} E + P $$\nwhere $I$ represents one or more catalytic intermediates (e.g., an enzyme-substrate complex $ES$ or a covalent intermediate).\n\n**Interpretation of Experimental Parameters:**\n\n- **Steady-State Rate ($v_{\\mathrm{ss}}$):** The rate $v_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0.030\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ represents the turnover rate of the enzyme in the steady state. From this, we can calculate the macroscopic turnover number, or catalytic constant $k_{\\text{cat}}$, which represents the rate of the slow process on a per-enzyme basis.\n$$ k_{\\text{cat}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{[E]_0} = \\frac{0.030\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n- **Time Scales:** The experiment reveals two characteristic timescales.\n  - The **fast timescale** is that of the burst phase, given directly by $\\tau = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.004\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This is the time required for the system to relax to the steady state. The associated rate constant is $k_{\\text{fast}} = 1/\\tau = 1/(0.004\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 250\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n  - The **slow timescale** is the characteristic time for a single turnover cycle in the steady state. This is the inverse of the catalytic constant, $\\tau_{\\text{slow}} = 1/k_{\\text{cat}} = 1/(0.015\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\approx 66.7\\,\\mathrm{s}$. An equivalent representation of this timescale is the time required for the reaction at steady state to produce an amount of product equal to the total enzyme concentration: $[E]_0/v_{\\mathrm{ss}} = (2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) / (0.030\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\approx 66.7\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nA profound separation of timescales is evident:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{fast}} = 0.004\\,\\mathrm{s} \\ll \\tau_{\\text{slow}} \\approx 66.7\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe ratio $\\tau_{\\text{slow}}/\\tau_{\\text{fast}}$ is approximately $16,700$.\n\n- **Burst Amplitude ($A$):** The amplitude $A = 1.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is stoichiometrically significant. It is very close to the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_0 = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Specifically, $A/[E]_0 = 1.8/2.0 = 0.9$. This indicates that during the fast burst phase, approximately $90\\%$ of the total enzyme population is rapidly converted into the catalytic intermediate form $I$. This intermediate pool then turns over slowly to produce product in the linear phase.\n\n**Evaluation of Approximations:**\n\n- **Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA):** The QSSA applies to an intermediate $I$ when its concentration changes very slowly compared to the timescale of the overall reaction. The modern understanding of QSSA is rooted in timescale separation. The system possesses fast eigenmodes corresponding to the formation/equilibration of intermediates, and slow eigenmodes corresponding to catalytic turnover. After the fast modes have decayed (i.e., for $t \\gg \\tau$), the system evolves along a \"slow manifold\" where the intermediate concentrations are \"slaved\" to the slower-changing species concentrations. On this slow manifold, the net rate of change of the intermediate is nearly zero, i.e., $\\mathrm{d}[I]/\\mathrm{d}t \\approx 0$.\nThe data directly and powerfully support this view. The observation of a fast phase ($\\tau$) followed by a much slower linear phase ($\\tau_{\\text{slow}}$) is the definitive signature of timescale separation. The large burst amplitude, $A \\approx [E]_0$, indicates that a high concentration of intermediate $I$ is established rapidly and then remains nearly constant (i.e., is \"quasi-steady\") while it is slowly consumed during the steady-state phase. The conditions observed in the experiment—a large separation of timescales and an intermediate pool that accumulates to a high, nearly constant level—are precisely the conditions that define and validate the application of the QSSA to the intermediate $I$ for $t \\gg \\tau$.\n\n- **Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA):** The PEA is a more specific condition. It applies when a single reversible step, $E + S \\rightleftharpoons I$, is much faster in both directions than the subsequent catalytic step, $I \\to E+P$. This requires the rate of dissociation of the intermediate back to reactants to be much greater than its rate of conversion to product, i.e., $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$. If PEA holds, the first step is effectively at thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the reaction. While our analysis above suggests this condition is likely met (as it leads to a large burst under saturating substrate), the QSSA is a more general description of the observed phenomenon. The data *directly shows* a quasi-steady intermediate population; it does not directly show that $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$. One can have a valid QSSA without a valid PEA (for instance, in the case of fast, irreversible binding where $k_2 \\gg k_{-1}$ but $k_1[S]_0$ is large). Therefore, concluding QSSA is a more direct and robust interpretation of the provided kinetic trace. The core evidence is the vast timescale separation and the high, stable concentration of the intermediate after the burst.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. QSSA is more appropriate than PEA, because the data show a fast relaxation to a long-lived, nearly constant intermediate pool on a slow turnover timescale, as evidenced by $\\tau \\ll [E]_0/v_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and a burst amplitude $A \\approx [E]_0$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the key features of the data. The condition $\\tau \\ll [E]_0/v_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ ($0.004\\,\\mathrm{s} \\ll 66.7\\,\\mathrm{s}$) quantitatively confirms the separation of timescales. The condition $A \\approx [E]_0$ ($1.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} \\approx 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) confirms that a substantial, near-stoichiometric amount of intermediate is formed. These two observations together are the definitive experimental signature for the validity of the QSSA for the intermediate pool after the initial transient. The reasoning is direct and sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. PEA is more appropriate than QSSA, because the rapid burst indicates that the initial reversible binding step must be at equilibrium before product formation; the observed $\\tau$ demonstrates that $k_{-1} \\gg$ the catalytic rate constant.**\nThis statement contains flawed logic. A rapid burst does not strictly require pre-equilibrium; it only requires that the formation of the intermediate is fast relative to its subsequent turnover. Furthermore, the observed $\\tau$ represents the timescale for the approach to the steady state, related to the sum of several rate constants (e.g., $k_{\\text{obs}} = 1/\\tau \\approx k_1[S]_0 + k_{-1} + k_2$ in the minimal model), not just one. It does not, by itself, demonstrate that $k_{-1}$ is large compared to the catalytic rate constant. This conclusion requires more assumptions and is less direct than the conclusion in option A.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both QSSA and PEA are equally appropriate, because any fast early step implies both rapid equilibration and quasi-steady behavior, so either approximation will capture the observed kinetics to the same degree.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A fast early step does not necessarily imply rapid equilibration (PEA). For example, a fast, effectively irreversible binding step ($k_1[S]_0$ large, $k_{-1}$ small) would not satisfy the PEA condition but would satisfy the conditions for QSSA. PEA is a special case of the conditions under which QSSA is valid for the Michaelis-Menten-type mechanism, but the two approximations are not generally equivalent.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Neither QSSA nor PEA is appropriate, because the presence of a burst violates the separation of timescales required by both approximations, as indicated by the finite value of $\\tau$.**\nThis statement demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. The presence of a burst, characterized by a fast timescale $\\tau$ that is clearly distinct from the much slower timescale of steady-state turnover, is the primary *evidence for* a separation of timescales, not a violation of it. A finite, small value for $\\tau$ is precisely what is expected when such a separation exists.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2654909"}, {"introduction": "A proposed mechanism is incomplete without its parameters, and these parameters are meaningless without an assessment of their reliability.

To perform linear regression, we linearize this equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln k = \\ln A - \\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThis equation is of the form of a linear model, $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$, where the dependent variable is $y = \\ln k$, the independent variable is $x = 1/T$, the intercept is $\\beta_0 = \\ln A$, and the slope is $\\beta_1 = -E_a/R$.\n\nThe experimental measurements provide data points $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i = 1/T_i$ and $y_i = \\ln k_i$. The statistical model is $y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i$, where the errors $\\epsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and known variance $\\sigma_y^2$, i.e., $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_y^2)$.\n\nThe ordinary least squares estimator for the slope, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, is given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the sample means of $x_i$ and $y_i$, respectively. The denominator is commonly denoted as $S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$. The numerator can be simplified to $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})y_i$. Thus, $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{1}{S_{xx}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})y_i$.\n\nThe variance of the slope estimator, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$, is derived as follows. Since the $x_i$ are fixed design variables and the $y_i$ are independent random variables each with variance $\\sigma_y^2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{S_{xx}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})y_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{S_{xx}^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}((x_i - \\bar{x})y_i) = \\frac{1}{S_{xx}^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\mathrm{Var}(y_i) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{1}{S_{xx}^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sigma_y^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_y^2}{S_{xx}^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_y^2 S_{xx}}{S_{xx}^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_y^2}{S_{xx}} $$\nThis completes the first task. The sampling variance of the slope estimator is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\sigma_y^2 / S_{xx}$.\n\nNext, we propagate this uncertainty to the activation energy, $E_a$. The estimator for $E_a$ is $\\hat{E}_a = -R \\hat{\\beta}_1$. The variance of $\\hat{E}_a$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{E}_a) = \\mathrm{Var}(-R \\hat{\\beta}_1) = (-R)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = R^2 \\frac{\\sigma_y^2}{S_{xx}} $$\nThe standard error of the activation energy estimator is $\\sigma_{\\hat{E}_a} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{E}_a)} = \\frac{R \\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}}}$.\n\nSince $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is a linear combination of Gaussian random variables ($y_i$), its sampling distribution is also Gaussian. Consequently, $\\hat{E}_a$ is also normally distributed. As the population variance $\\sigma_y^2$ is known, the confidence interval is constructed using the standard normal (Gaussian) distribution, not the Student's $t$-distribution. A two-sided confidence interval for $E_a$ at a confidence level of $1-\\alpha$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{E}_a \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma_{\\hat{E}_a} = \\hat{E}_a \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{R \\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}}} $$\nFor a confidence level of $0.95$, we have $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The required quantile is $z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975}$, which is approximately $1.95996$. This completes the second task.\n\nTo compute the half-width of this confidence interval, $W = z_{0.975} \\sigma_{\\hat{E}_a}$, we first need to calculate $S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1/T_i - \\overline{1/T})^2$.\nThe temperatures are $T_i \\in \\{300, 320, 340, 360, 380\\}$ K. The corresponding $x_i = 1/T_i$ values are:\n$x_1 = 1/300\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n$x_2 = 1/320\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n$x_3 = 1/340\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n$x_4 = 1/360\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n$x_5 = 1/380\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\nThe sum is $\\sum x_i \\approx 0.01480887\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, and the sum of squares is $\\sum x_i^2 \\approx 4.4168305 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-2}}$.\nWe use the formula $S_{xx} = \\sum x_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum x_i)^2}{n}$ with $n=5$:\n$$ S_{xx} \\approx 4.4168305 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-2}} - \\frac{(0.01480887\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}})^2}{5} \\approx (4.4168305 - 4.3860298) \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-2}} $$\n$$ S_{xx} \\approx 3.08007 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-2}} $$\nNow we compute the half-width $W$:\n$$ W = z_{0.975} \\frac{R \\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}}} \\approx 1.95996 \\times \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times 0.05}{\\sqrt{3.08007 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-2}}}} $$\n$$ W \\approx 1.95996 \\times \\frac{0.4157\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}{5.54984 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}} \\approx 1.95996 \\times 749.03\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} \\approx 1468.07\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nTo express this in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, we divide by $1000$:\n$$ W \\approx 1.46807\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the half-width is $1.468\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. This completes the third task.\n\nFinally, we address the fourth task: explaining the effect of the temperature range on the uncertainty in $E_a$. The uncertainty in $\\hat{E}_a$, as quantified by the confidence interval half-width $W$, is inversely proportional to $\\sqrt{S_{xx}}$:\n$$ W \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} $$\nwhere $x_i = 1/T_i$. The term $S_{xx}$ measures the spread or dispersion of the independent variable values $x_i$. To minimize $W$, one must maximize $S_{xx}$. For a fixed number of measurements $n$, $S_{xx}$ is maximized by increasing the range of the $x_i$ values. A wider range in temperature $T$ (i.e., a larger difference between $T_{\\text{max}}$ and $T_{\\text{min}}$) leads to a wider range in $x = 1/T$. Therefore, performing measurements over a broader temperature range increases the value of $S_{xx}$, which in turn decreases the variance of the slope estimator and, consequently, reduces the uncertainty in the derived activation energy $E_a$. An experiment conducted over a narrow temperature range will yield a less precise estimate of $E_a$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.468}$$", "id": "2654938"}]}
