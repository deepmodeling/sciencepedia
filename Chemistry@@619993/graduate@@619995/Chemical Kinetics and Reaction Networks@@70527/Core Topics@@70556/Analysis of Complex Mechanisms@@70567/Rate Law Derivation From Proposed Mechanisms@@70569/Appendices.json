The system is assumed to be well-mixed, isothermal, and at constant volume, allowing the use of concentrations directly in the rate laws derived from the law of mass action.\n\nFirst, we derive the system of ordinary differential equations that describes the time evolution of the concentrations of all species: $[A]$, $[B]$, $[C]$, and $[P]$.\n\nThe rate of change of $[A]$ is determined by its consumption in the forward reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$ and its production in the reverse reaction $C \\rightarrow A + B$.

Its rate of formation is:\n$$\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[C]$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we derive the rate of product formation, $v \\equiv \\frac{d[P]}{dt}$, under the steady-state approximation (SSA) for the intermediate $C$. The SSA posits that the concentration of the reactive intermediate $C$ is very low and its rate of change is negligible compared to the rates of change of reactants and products. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{d[C]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\nApplying this approximation to the differential equation for $[C]$:\n$$\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[C] \\approx 0$$\nWe can now solve for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$:\n$$(k_{-1} + k_{2})[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = k_{1}[A][B]$$\n$$[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}$$\nThe rate of product formation under the SSA, $v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$, is then found by substituting this expression for $[C]$ into the rate law for $P$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right)$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A][B]$$\n\nNow, we derive the rate of product formation under the pre-equilibrium (PE) assumption.

One power of $k_{2}$ in the numerator cancels with the $k_{2}$ in the denominator. This leaves:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}$$\nThis is the final, simplest exact closed form for the relative deviation $\\delta$ in terms of only the microscopic rate constants, as required. The result correctly shows that the deviation $\\delta$ approaches $0$ as $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$, which is precisely the condition under which the pre-equilibrium assumption is valid, meaning $v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$ converges to $v_{\\mathrm{PE}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2667507"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of deriving rate laws is often to connect a microscopic mechanistic hypothesis to macroscopic, measurable data.
