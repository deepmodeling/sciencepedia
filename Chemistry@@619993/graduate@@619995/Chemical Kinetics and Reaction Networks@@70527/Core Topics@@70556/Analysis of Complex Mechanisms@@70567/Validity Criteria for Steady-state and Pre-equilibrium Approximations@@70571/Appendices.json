In some experiments, time series of $ES(t)$ inferred from rapid-mixing spectroscopy show an initial overshoot of $ES$ relative to the instantaneous slow manifold $ES^{\\ast}(S(t))$, followed by relaxation onto that manifold; nonlinear regression that includes these early data can bias estimates of $K_{M}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.\n\nStarting from the mass-action ordinary differential equations,\n$$\\dfrac{dS}{dt}=-k_{1}(E_{0}-ES)S+k_{-1}ES,\\qquad \\dfrac{dES}{dt}=k_{1}(E_{0}-ES)S-(k_{-1}+k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES,$$\nand using only fundamental principles of fast–slow decomposition and linearization about the initial state, which option best explains how an initial overshoot in $ES(t)$ can arise and provides a scientifically sound, practically usable criterion to exclude data from the initial layer when fitting $K_{M}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$?\n\nA. During the fast transient, $S(t)$ is approximately constant at $S_{0}$, so $ES(t)$ rapidly approaches $ES^{\\ast}(S_{0})$ with a relaxation rate $k_{1}S_{0}+k_{-1}+k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. Because $S(t)$ is slowly decreasing at the same time, the slow manifold $ES^{\\ast}(S(t))$ is drifting downward, which can cause the trajectory $ES(t)$ to cross above the instantaneous $ES^{\\ast}(S(t))$ before relaxing back onto it; thus a transient overshoot relative to $ES^{\\ast}$ is possible even when the long-time QSSA (with small $\\varepsilon:=E_{0}/(K_{M}+S_{0})$) holds.

Overshoot is caused by product inhibition, which is absent here; hence QSSA is valid from $t=0$ provided $S_{0}\\gg K_{M}$.

This is typically true when the total enzyme concentration is much less than the substrate concentration ($E_{0} \\ll S_{0}$).\n\nDuring the very beginning of the reaction (the \"initial layer\"), the slow variable $S(t)$ can be approximated as constant at its initial value, $S(t) \\approx S(0) = S_{0}$.\nThe ODE for $ES$ becomes:\n$$ \\dfrac{dES}{dt} \\approx k_{1}(E_{0}-ES)S_{0} - (k_{-1}+k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES $$\nThis is a linear, first-order ODE for $ES(t)$, which can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\dfrac{dES}{dt} = k_{1}E_{0}S_{0} - (k_{1}S_{0} + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})ES $$\nThe solution to this equation, with the initial condition $ES(0) = 0$, describes an exponential approach to a steady value:\n$$ ES(t) \\approx \\dfrac{k_{1}E_{0}S_{0}}{k_{1}S_{0} + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{fast}}t} \\right) $$\nThe relaxation rate is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{fast}} = k_{1}S_{0} + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.\nThe target value is the quasi-steady-state concentration evaluated at the initial substrate concentration, $ES^{\\ast}(S_{0}) = \\frac{E_{0}S_{0}}{K_{M}+S_{0}}$.\n\n**Explanation of the Overshoot**\nThe QSSA states that after the initial transient, the system's state lies on the \"slow manifold\" defined by $\\frac{dES}{dt} \\approx 0$. This gives the instantaneous steady-state concentration:\n$$ ES^{\\ast}(S(t)) = \\dfrac{E_{0}S(t)}{K_{M}+S(t)} $$\nAs the reaction proceeds, substrate is consumed, so $S(t)$ decreases over time. Since $ES^{\\ast}(S)$ is an increasing function of $S$, the slow manifold $ES^{\\ast}(S(t))$ is a decreasing function of time.\nThe initial fast dynamics drive $ES(t)$ toward the fixed target $ES^{\\ast}(S_{0})$. However, the \"true\" target, the slow manifold $ES^{\\ast}(S(t))$, is simultaneously moving downward. The trajectory $ES(t)$ is aiming for a target that is drifting away. This can cause the trajectory to cross above the descending manifold before relaxing back onto it, resulting in an overshoot relative to the instantaneous slow manifold.\n\n**Derivation of the Exclusion Criterion**\nThe QSSA is considered valid after this initial transient has decayed. The duration of this transient is characterized by the fast relaxation time, $1/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{fast}}$. A practical criterion is to wait for the exponential term $e^{-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{fast}}t}$ to become smaller than a specified tolerance $\\eta \\in (0,1)$.\n$$ e^{-\\lambda_{\\mathrm{fast}}t_{\\mathrm{IL}}} \\le \\eta \\implies t_{\\mathrm{IL}} \\ge \\frac{\\ln(1/\\eta)}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{fast}}} $$\nThus, a conservative criterion is to exclude data for times $t  t_{\\mathrm{IL}}(\\eta)$, where\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{IL}}(\\eta) = \\dfrac{1}{k_{1}S_{0} + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\eta}\\right) $$\nThis provides a scientifically justified method to remove pre-steady-state data before model fitting.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n*   **A:** This option correctly identifies the constant substrate approximation in the initial layer, the correct relaxation rate, the downward drift of the slow manifold as the cause of the overshoot, and the correct mathematical form for the exclusion time.
