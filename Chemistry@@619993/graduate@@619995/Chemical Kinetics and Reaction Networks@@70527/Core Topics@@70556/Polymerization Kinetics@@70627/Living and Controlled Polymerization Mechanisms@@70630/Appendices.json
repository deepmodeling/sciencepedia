It presents a standard, albeit simplified, kinetic model of Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP). The givens are self-contained and consistent, describing an idealized scenario commonly used for fundamental analysis in polymer chemistry. All terms are defined, and the objectives are clear. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe problem is solved in three parts: first, the derivation of the time $t$ to reach a target degree of polymerization $X_{\\mathrm{target}}$; second, the derivation of the fractional loss of chains $\\phi$ and the condition for this loss to be negligible; and third, the calculation of the number-average molar mass $M_n$ and dispersity $Đ$ under the condition of negligible termination.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of polymerization time $t$\n\nThe rate of monomer consumption is given by the propagation rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = -k_p [M] [P^\\bullet]\n$$\nwhere $[M]$ is the monomer concentration, $[P^\\bullet]$ is the concentration of active polymer chains (radicals), and $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant.\n\nThe problem specifies a rapid activation-deactivation equilibrium, described by an effective, time-invariant equilibrium constant $K_{ATRP}$:\n$$\n\\frac{[P^\\bullet]}{[\\mathrm{P-X}]} = K_{ATRP}\n$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{P-X}]$ is the concentration of dormant polymer chains. The total concentration of chains, $[C]$, is the sum of active and dormant species: $[C] = [\\mathrm{P-X}] + [P^\\bullet]$. Solving for $[P^\\bullet]$ gives $[P^\\bullet] = K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]$. Substituting this into the sum gives $[C] = [\\mathrm{P-X}](1+K_{ATRP})$.\nTherefore, $[P^\\bullet] = \\frac{K_{ATRP}}{1+K_{ATRP}} [C]$.\n\nA key feature of a well-controlled, \"living\" polymerization is the suppression of termination reactions. As a first approximation, which we will validate in Part 2, we assume termination is negligible. Under this assumption, the total number of chains remains constant and equal to the initial concentration of the initiator, $[\\mathrm{P-X}]_0$. Thus, $[C](t) \\approx [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0$.\nThe radical concentration can then be expressed as:\n$$\n[P^\\bullet] \\approx \\frac{K_{ATRP}}{1+K_{ATRP}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0\n$$\nThe problem also states that $[P^\\bullet] \\ll [\\mathrm{P-X}]$, which implies $K_{ATRP} \\ll 1$. Consequently, the denominator $(1+K_{ATRP}) \\approx 1$, leading to the simplification:\n$$\n[P^\\bullet] \\approx K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0\n$$\nThis shows that the active radical concentration is approximately constant throughout the polymerization, a characteristic feature of this idealized ATRP model.\n\nSubstituting this constant radical concentration into the monomer consumption rate law yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d[M]}{dt} \\approx -k_p K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0 [M]\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $[M]$. We solve it by separating variables and integrating from the initial conditions ($t=0$, $[M]=[M]_0$) to a time $t$ and concentration $[M](t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{[M]_0}^{[M](t)} \\frac{d[M]}{[M]} = - \\int_0^t k_p K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0 d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0}\\right) = - (k_p K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0) t\n$$\nThe target number-average degree of polymerization, $X_{\\mathrm{target}}$, is defined as the number of monomer units consumed per initial chain:\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{[M]_0 - [M](t)}{[\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we express the monomer concentration $[M](t)$ at the target point:\n$$\n[M](t) = [M]_0 - X_{\\mathrm{target}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0\n$$\nThe ratio $[M](t)/[M]_0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0} = 1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}{[M]_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}{[M]_0}\\right) = - (k_p K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0) t\n$$\nSolving for the time $t$ gives the final expression:\n$$\nt = - \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}{[M]_0}\\right)}{k_p K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Fractional loss of chains $\\phi$\n\nWe now verify the validity of our assumption of negligible termination. Termination occurs by the bimolecular combination of two active chains, with rate constant $k_t$. The rate of termination events is $R_t = k_t [P^\\bullet]^2$. Each combination event reduces the total number of chains by one. The rate of change of the total chain concentration $[C]$ is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = -R_t = -k_t [P^\\bullet]^2\n$$\nThe total number of chains lost up to time $t$, $\\Delta [C]$, is the integral of this rate:\n$$\n\\Delta [C] = \\int_0^t k_t ([P^\\bullet](\\tau))^2 d\\tau\n$$\nThe fractional loss of chains, $\\phi$, is the ratio of chains lost to the initial number of chains:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\Delta [C]}{[\\mathrm{P-X}]_0} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{P-X}]_0} \\int_0^t k_t ([P^\\bullet](\\tau))^2 d\\tau\n$$\nUsing the same approximation as in Part 1, $[P^\\bullet] \\approx K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0$, which is treated as a constant:\n$$\n\\phi \\approx \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{P-X}]_0} \\int_0^t k_t (K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0)^2 d\\tau = \\frac{k_t (K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0)^2}{[\\mathrm{P-X}]_0} \\int_0^t d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\phi \\approx k_t K_{ATRP}^2 [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0 t\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the time $t$ required to reach $X_{\\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$\n\\phi \\approx k_t K_{ATRP}^2 [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0 \\left( - \\frac{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}{[M]_0}\\right)}{k_p K_{ATRP} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the fractional loss of chains:\n$$\n\\phi \\approx - \\frac{k_t K_{ATRP}}{k_p} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{target}} [\\mathrm{P-X}]_0}{[M]_0}\\right)\n$$\nThe assumption of negligible termination is justified if this fractional loss is much less than unity, i.e., the condition is $\\phi \\ll 1$.\n\nPart 3: Derivation of $M_n$ and $Đ$\n\nWe now operate under the regime where termination is negligible, as per the condition $\\phi \\ll 1$. This scenario conforms to an ideal living polymerization with the following characteristics given in the problem:\n1.  Instantaneous and quantitative initiation: all chains begin growing at $t=0$.\n2.  Negligible termination: the number of growing chains is constant.\n3.  Rapid exchange limit: all chains have an equal time-averaged probability of propagation.\n\nThese are the precise conditions under which the number of monomer units per chain, i.e., the degree of polymerization $X$, follows a Poisson distribution. The number-average degree of polymerization, $X_n$, is the mean of this distribution. By its definition in the problem, at the target point, $X_n = X_{\\mathrm{target}}$.\n\nThe number-average molar mass, $M_n$, is the total mass of the polymer divided by the total number of moles of polymer chains. For a chain of average length $X_n$, the mass is the sum of the mass of the initiator fragment, $M_{\\mathrm{ini}}$, and the mass of the $X_n$ monomer units, each with molar mass $M_M$.\n$$\nM_n = M_{\\mathrm{ini}} + X_n M_M\n$$\nSubstituting $X_n = X_{\\mathrm{target}}$, we get:\n$$\nM_n = M_{\\mathrm{ini}} + X_{\\mathrm{target}} M_M\n$$\nThe dispersity, $Đ$, is defined as the ratio of the weight-average molar mass, $M_w$, to the number-average molar mass, $M_n$. It is equivalent to the ratio of the weight-average degree of polymerization, $X_w$, to the number-average degree of polymerization, $X_n$.\n$$\nĐ = \\frac{M_w}{M_n} = \\frac{X_w}{X_n}\n$$\nFor a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = X_n$, the second moment (mean square) of the distribution is $E[X^2] = \\lambda^2 + \\lambda = X_n^2 + X_n$.\nThe weight-average degree of polymerization is defined as:\n$$\nX_w = \\frac{\\sum_i X_i^2 N_i}{\\sum_i X_i N_i} = \\frac{E[X^2]}{E[X]} = \\frac{X_n^2 + X_n}{X_n} = X_n + 1\n$$\nTherefore, the dispersity $Đ$ is:\n$$\nĐ = \\frac{X_n + 1}{X_n} = 1 + \\frac{1}{X_n}\n$$\nAt the target conversion, we substitute $X_n = X_{\\mathrm{target}}$ to obtain the dispersity:\n$$\nĐ = 1 + \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{target}}}\n$$\nThe final answer consists of the expressions for $M_n$ and $Đ$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nM_{\\mathrm{ini}} + X_{\\mathrm{target}} M_M & 1 + \\frac{1}{X_{\\mathrm{target}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2653785"}, {"introduction": "To deepen our analysis of polymer chain length distributions, we can employ the powerful method of moments.

A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Derivation of Number-Average Molar Mass ($M_n$)**\n\nThe number-average molar mass, $M_n$, is defined as the total mass of the polymer divided by the total number of moles of polymer chains.\nThe total mass of the polymer is equal to the mass of the monomer that has been consumed, as the contribution of end-groups is neglected. For a system of volume $V$, the mass of consumed monomer is given by $([M]_0 - [M]) \\cdot V \\cdot M_m$, where $[M]$ is the monomer concentration at a given time.\n\nThe problem states that termination and chain transfer are negligible. This implies that the total number of chains is conserved throughout the polymerization. All chains originate from the initial dormant species, $\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}$. Therefore, the total concentration of chains, $[C]_{total}$, is constant and equal to the initial concentration of the dormant species:\n$$[C]_{total} = [\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0$$\nThe total number of moles of chains in volume $V$ is $[\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0 \\cdot V$.\n\nThe expression for $M_n$ is thus:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\text{total polymer mass}}{\\text{total moles of chains}} = \\frac{([M]_0 - [M]) \\cdot V \\cdot M_m}{[\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0 \\cdot V}$$\nThe volume term $V$ cancels. We introduce the monomer conversion, $x$, defined as the fraction of monomer consumed:\n$$x = \\frac{[M]_0 - [M]}{[M]_0}$$\nFrom this, the concentration of consumed monomer is $[M]_0 - [M] = x[M]_0$. Substituting this into the expression for $M_n$:\n$$M_n = \\frac{x[M]_0}{[\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0} M_m$$\nThis expression gives the number-average molar mass at any conversion $x$. At the specified conversion of $x = 0.6$, the expression is:\n$$M_n = \\frac{0.6 [M]_0}{[\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0} M_m$$\nNote that this expression does not depend on the kinetic parameters $k_p$ or $K$. These parameters govern the *rate* at which conversion is reached, but not the molar mass *at* a given conversion for an ideal living polymerization.\n\n**Derivation of Dispersity ($Đ$)**\n\nDispersity is defined as $Đ = M_w/M_n$. In terms of the moments of the chain length distribution, it is given by $Đ = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu_2}{\\mu_1^2}$, where $\\mu_k = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n^k [P_n]$ is the $k$-th moment of the polymer chain length distribution, with $[P_n]$ being the concentration of chains of length $n$.\n\nThe zeroth moment, $\\mu_0$, is the total concentration of polymer chains. Due to the conservation of chains:\n$$\\mu_0 = \\sum_{n} [P_n] = [C]_{total} = [\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0 = \\text{constant}$$\n\nThe first moment, $\\mu_1$, represents the total concentration of monomer units incorporated into polymer chains. Its rate of change is the rate of monomer consumption:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_1}{dt} = -\\frac{d[M]}{dt}$$\nFrom the law of mass action for the propagation step, $-\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = k_p [M] [\\mathrm{P}^{\\bullet}]$. Thus:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_1}{dt} = k_p [M] [\\mathrm{P}^{\\bullet}]$$\n\nThe rate of change of the second moment, $\\mu_2$, is derived from the propagation reaction. A chain of length $n-1$ grows to length $n$ at a rate proportional to $k_p[M][\\mathrm{P}_{n-1}^{\\bullet}]$. The sum of squared lengths changes accordingly:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_n n^2 [P_n] = \\sum_n n^2 \\frac{d[P_n]}{dt}$$\nThe concentration of chains of length $n$, $[P_n] = [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] + [\\mathrm{P}_n\\text{-ON}]$, changes due to propagation as $\\frac{d[P_n]}{dt} = k_p[M]([\\mathrm{P}_{n-1}^{\\bullet}] - [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}])$. The fast activation-deactivation terms do not affect the total concentration $[P_n]$ on the timescale of propagation.\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{dt} = \\sum_n n^2 k_p[M]([\\mathrm{P}_{n-1}^{\\bullet}] - [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}]) = k_p[M] \\sum_n (n^2[\\mathrm{P}_{n-1}^{\\bullet}] - n^2[\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}])$$\nBy re-indexing the first term ($j=n-1$), the sum becomes:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{dt} = k_p[M] \\left( \\sum_j (j+1)^2 [\\mathrm{P}_j^{\\bullet}] - \\sum_n n^2 [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] \\right)$$\n$$= k_p[M] \\left( \\sum_j (j^2+2j+1) [\\mathrm{P}_j^{\\bullet}] - \\sum_n n^2 [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] \\right)$$\n$$= k_p[M] \\left( \\sum_j j^2 [\\mathrm{P}_j^{\\bullet}] + 2\\sum_j j[\\mathrm{P}_j^{\\bullet}] + \\sum_j [\\mathrm{P}_j^{\\bullet}] - \\sum_n n^2 [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] \\right)$$\nThe terms $\\sum j^2 [\\mathrm{P}_j^{\\bullet}]$ and $\\sum n^2 [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}]$ cancel, leaving:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{dt} = k_p[M] \\left( 2\\sum_n n[\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] + \\sum_n [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] \\right) = k_p[M] (2\\mu_1^{\\bullet} + \\mu_0^{\\bullet})$$\nwhere $\\mu_k^{\\bullet}$ are the moments of the *active* chain distribution.\n\nThe crucial assumption is \"fast activation–deactivation relative to propagation\". This implies that the probability of a chain being active is independent of its length. Thus, the ratio of active to dormant chains is the same for all lengths and equal to the overall ratio $K$:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}]}{[\\mathrm{P}_n\\text{-ON}]} = K \\implies [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] = \\frac{K}{K+1} [P_n]$$\nThis allows us to relate the moments of the active distribution to the moments of the total distribution:\n$$\\mu_0^{\\bullet} = \\sum [\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] = \\frac{K}{K+1} \\sum [P_n] = \\frac{K}{K+1}\\mu_0 = [\\mathrm{P}^{\\bullet}]$$\n$$\\mu_1^{\\bullet} = \\sum n[\\mathrm{P}_n^{\\bullet}] = \\frac{K}{K+1} \\sum n[P_n] = \\frac{K}{K+1}\\mu_1$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\frac{d\\mu_2}{dt}$:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{dt} = k_p[M] \\left( 2 \\frac{K}{K+1}\\mu_1 + \\frac{K}{K+1}\\mu_0 \\right) = \\frac{K}{K+1}k_p[M](2\\mu_1 + \\mu_0)$$\n\nTo find $Đ$ as a function of conversion, we eliminate time by considering the change of $\\mu_2$ with respect to $\\mu_1$:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{d\\mu_1} = \\frac{d\\mu_2/dt}{d\\mu_1/dt} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{K+1}k_p[M](2\\mu_1 + \\mu_0)}{k_p[M][\\mathrm{P}^{\\bullet}]}$$\nSince $[\\mathrm{P}^{\\bullet}] = \\frac{K}{K+1}\\mu_0$, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{d\\mu_2}{d\\mu_1} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{K+1}k_p[M](2\\mu_1 + \\mu_0)}{\\frac{K}{K+1}k_p[M]\\mu_0} = \\frac{2\\mu_1 + \\mu_0}{\\mu_0} = 2\\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_0} + 1$$\nThis step demonstrates why the kinetic parameters $k_p$ and $K$ cancel from the final expression for dispersity under the given assumptions. They are present as a common multiplicative factor in the time derivatives of the moments and thus vanish in the ratio.\n\nWe integrate this ordinary differential equation with the initial condition that at $t=0$, no monomer has been consumed, so $\\mu_1=0$ and $\\mu_2=0$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\mu_2} d\\mu_2' = \\int_{0}^{\\mu_1} \\left( 2\\frac{\\mu_1'}{\\mu_0} + 1 \\right) d\\mu_1'$$\n$$\\mu_2 = \\left[ \\frac{(\\mu_1')^2}{\\mu_0} + \\mu_1' \\right]_0^{\\mu_1} = \\frac{\\mu_1^2}{\\mu_0} + \\mu_1$$\nNow we compute the dispersity:\n$$Đ = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\mu_2}{\\mu_1^2} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\mu_1^2} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_1^2}{\\mu_0} + \\mu_1 \\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\mu_1}$$\nSubstituting $\\mu_0 = [\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0$ and $\\mu_1 = x[M]_0$:\n$$Đ = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{P\\text{-}O\\text{-}N}]_0}{x[M]_0}$$\nThis is the general expression for dispersity as a function of conversion.

The number-average molar mass predicted by stoichiometry is $M_{n,\\mathrm{th}} = M_{\\mathrm{frag}} + M_{m} X_{n}$, where $M_{\\mathrm{frag}}$ is the initiator-derived fragment mass that becomes part of each chain and $M_{m}$ is the monomer molar mass.\n\nExperimental conditions and data:\n- Initial monomer concentration $[\\mathrm{M}]_{0} = 2.00\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\n- Initial initiator concentration $[\\mathrm{I}]_{0} = 0.0200\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\n- Monomer molar mass $M_{m} = 100.00\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$.\n- Initiator fragment mass $M_{\\mathrm{frag}} = 195.0\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$.\n- Conversions and SEC outputs (each item is a triplet $(p, M_{n,\\mathrm{obs}}, \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}})$):\n  - $(0.10, 1210\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}, 1.18)$\n  - $(0.25, 2680\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}, 1.12)$\n  - $(0.40, 4200\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}, 1.10)$\n  - $(0.60, 6180\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}, 1.08)$\n  - $(0.80, 8150\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}, 1.07)$\n  - $(0.92, 9420\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}, 1.06)$\n\nTo quantitatively assess linear growth of $M_{n}$ and approach of $\\text{Đ}$ toward unity, define the following two dimensionless diagnostics using the theoretical baselines stated above:\n- The normalized root-mean-square deviation for $M_{n}$,\n$$\n\\mathrm{NRMSD} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{M_{n,\\mathrm{obs}}(p_{i}) - M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i})}{M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{\\max})}\\right)^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of data points and $p_{\\max}$ is the largest conversion in the set.\n- The mean absolute deviation of $\\text{Đ}$ from the living-theory prediction,\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left| \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}}(p_{i}) - \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i}) \\right|.\n$$\n\nFinally, form a composite control metric\n$$\nC \\equiv \\sqrt{\\mathrm{NRMSD}^{2} + \\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}}^{2}}.\n$$\n\nStarting from the stated fundamental definitions for $X_{n}$ and $M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}$, compute $X_{n}(p_{i})$, $M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i})$, $\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i})$, then evaluate $\\mathrm{NRMSD}$, $\\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}}$, and the composite $C$.

Report only the value of $C$ as the final answer. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a dimensionless number.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary definitions, constants, and data required for a complete, unique solution. The context is a standard analysis of a controlled polymerization process, and the provided numerical values are physically realistic. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute a composite metric, $C$, that quantifies the deviation of an experimental polymerization from ideal living behavior. This requires a systematic calculation of theoretical benchmarks and their comparison with experimental data.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical number-average degree of polymerization, $X_{n}$, as a function of fractional monomer conversion, $p$. The conversion is defined as $p = ([\\mathrm{M}]_{0} - [\\mathrm{M}]) / [\\mathrm{M}]_{0}$, where $[\\mathrm{M}]_{0}$ is the initial monomer concentration and $[\\mathrm{M}]$ is the concentration at a given time. This relationship can be rearranged to express the amount of consumed monomer: $[\\mathrm{M}]_{0} - [\\mathrm{M}] = p [\\mathrm{M}]_{0}$. The problem states that for an ideal living polymerization, $X_{n} = ([\\mathrm{M}]_{0} - [\\mathrm{M}]) / [\\mathrm{I}]_{0}$, where $[\\mathrm{I}]_{0}$ is the initial initiator concentration. Substituting the expression for consumed monomer, we obtain the theoretical $X_{n}$ as a function of conversion:\n$$\nX_{n}(p) = \\frac{p [\\mathrm{M}]_{0}}{[\\mathrm{I}]_{0}}\n$$\nUsing the provided initial concentrations, $[\\mathrm{M}]_{0} = 2.00\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$ and $[\\mathrm{I}]_{0} = 0.0200\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}$, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{M}]_{0}}{[\\mathrm{I}]_{0}} = \\frac{2.00}{0.0200} = 100\n$$\nThus, for this specific system, the theoretical degree of polymerization is $X_{n}(p) = 100 p$.\n\nNext, we calculate the theoretical number-average molar mass, $M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}$. The problem provides the formula $M_{n,\\mathrm{th}} = M_{\\mathrm{frag}} + M_{m} X_{n}$, where $M_{\\mathrm{frag}} = 195.0\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$ is the initiator fragment mass and $M_{m} = 100.00\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$ is the monomer molar mass. Substituting the expression for $X_n(p)$:\n$$\nM_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p) = 195.0 + (100.00)(100 p) = 195.0 + 10000 p\n$$\nThe theoretical dispersity, $\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}$, for a Poisson distribution resulting from ideal living polymerization is given as $\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 1 + 1/X_{n}$. Substituting the expression for $X_n(p)$:\n$$\n\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p) = 1 + \\frac{1}{100 p}\n$$\nWe now process each data point $(p_{i}, M_{n,\\mathrm{obs}}(p_i), \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}}(p_i))$ to compute the theoretical values and the deviations needed for the diagnostic metrics. The total number of data points is $N=6$.\n\nFor $p_1 = 0.10$:\n$X_n(p_1) = 100(0.10) = 10$\n$M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_1) = 195.0 + 10000(0.10) = 1195\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_1) = 1 + 1/10 = 1.10$\n\nFor $p_2 = 0.25$:\n$X_n(p_2) = 100(0.25) = 25$\n$M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_2) = 195.0 + 10000(0.25) = 2695\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_2) = 1 + 1/25 = 1.04$\n\nFor $p_3 = 0.40$:\n$X_n(p_3) = 100(0.40) = 40$\n$M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_3) = 195.0 + 10000(0.40) = 4195\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_3) = 1 + 1/40 = 1.025$\n\nFor $p_4 = 0.60$:\n$X_n(p_4) = 100(0.60) = 60$\n$M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_4) = 195.0 + 10000(0.60) = 6195\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_4) = 1 + 1/60 \\approx 1.01667$\n\nFor $p_5 = 0.80$:\n$X_n(p_5) = 100(0.80) = 80$\n$M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_5) = 195.0 + 10000(0.80) = 8195\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_5) = 1 + 1/80 = 1.0125$\n\nFor $p_6 = 0.92$:\n$X_n(p_6) = 100(0.92) = 92$\n$M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_6) = 195.0 + 10000(0.92) = 9395\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_6) = 1 + 1/92 \\approx 1.01087$\n\nNow we compute the normalized root-mean-square deviation, $\\mathrm{NRMSD}$. The normalization factor is the theoretical molar mass at maximum conversion, $p_{\\max}=0.92$, which is $M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{\\max}) = 9395\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$.\nThe sum of squared normalized differences is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left(\\frac{M_{n,\\mathrm{obs}}(p_{i}) - M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i})}{M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{\\max})}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{(9395)^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} (M_{n,\\mathrm{obs}}(p_{i}) - M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i}))^{2}\n$$\nThe differences $M_{n,\\mathrm{obs}}(p_{i}) - M_{n,\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i})$ are:\n$1210 - 1195 = 15$; $2680 - 2695 = -15$; $4200 - 4195 = 5$; $6180 - 6195 = -15$; $8150 - 8195 = -45$; $9420 - 9395 = 25$.\nSum of squares of these differences:\n$$\n(15)^{2} + (-15)^{2} + (5)^{2} + (-15)^{2} + (-45)^{2} + (25)^{2} = 225 + 225 + 25 + 225 + 2025 + 625 = 3350\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{NRMSD}^{2} = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{3350}{(9395)^{2}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{3350}{88266025} \\approx \\frac{3.7953 \\times 10^{-5}}{6} \\approx 6.3256 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{NRMSD} = \\sqrt{6.3256 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.002515\n$$\nNext, we compute the mean absolute deviation of dispersity, $\\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}}$. The absolute deviations $|\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}}(p_i) - \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_i)|$ are:\n$|1.18 - 1.10| = 0.08$\n$|1.12 - 1.04| = 0.08$\n$|1.10 - 1.025| = 0.075$\n$|1.08 - 1.01667| \\approx 0.06333$\n$|1.07 - 1.0125| = 0.0575$\n$|1.06 - 1.01087| \\approx 0.04913$\nThe sum of these deviations is approximately $0.08 + 0.08 + 0.075 + 0.06333 + 0.0575 + 0.04913 = 0.40496$.\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left| \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}}(p_{i}) - \\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}}(p_{i}) \\right| = \\frac{0.40496}{6} \\approx 0.06749\n$$\nThis analysis implies excellent control over molar mass, as $\\mathrm{NRMSD} \\approx 0.0025$ indicates deviations are a fraction of a percent of the final mass, which is well within typical SEC calibration uncertainty (often cited as $5-10\\%$). A reasonable threshold for declaring control might be $\\mathrm{NRMSD} < 0.05$. In regards to dispersity, the ideal theory, $\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1+1/X_n$, is a theoretical minimum. Experimental values $\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ are expected to be higher due to kinetic factors like non-instantaneous initiation. The observed trend of $\\text{Đ}_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ decreasing with conversion toward unity is characteristic of a controlled process. The mean deviation $\\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}} \\approx 0.067$ is also small, with a threshold for good control often considered to be $\\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}} < 0.1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the composite control metric $C$:\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{NRMSD}^{2} + \\overline{\\Delta \\text{Đ}}^{2}} = \\sqrt{(0.002515)^{2} + (0.06749)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{6.3256 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.0045549} = \\sqrt{0.0045612} \\approx 0.0675366\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.06754$. This composite value, being less than a heuristic threshold of $0.1$, quantitatively confirms that the polymerization exhibits a high degree of control.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.06754}\n$$", "id": "2653897"}]}
