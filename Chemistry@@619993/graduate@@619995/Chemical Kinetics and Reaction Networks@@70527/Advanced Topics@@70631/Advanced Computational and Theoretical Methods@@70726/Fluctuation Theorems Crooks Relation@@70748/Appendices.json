An external chemostatted protocol $t \\mapsto \\lambda_t$ drives the system from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$, changing the chemical potentials that couple to the network and thereby performing chemical work on individual stochastic trajectories. The forward experiment prepares the system in the equilibrium distribution corresponding to $\\lambda_0$ at $t=0$, then applies the protocol $\\{\\lambda_t\\}_{t\\in[0,\\tau]}$ and measures the stochastic work $W$. The reverse experiment prepares the system in the equilibrium distribution corresponding to $\\lambda_\\tau$ at $t=0$, then applies the time-reversed protocol $\\{\\tilde{\\lambda}_t\\}_{t\\in[0,\\tau]}$ and measures the stochastic work $W$; its distribution is reported as $P_R(W)$. The forward work distribution is $P_F(W)$. The unknown equilibrium free energy difference between the ensembles at $\\lambda_0$ and $\\lambda_\\tau$ is denoted by $\\Delta F$.\n\nBeyond using the crossing point of $P_F(W)$ and $P_R(-W)$ to estimate $\\Delta F$, an experimentalist proposes the following diagnostics and interpretations based on plotting the log-likelihood ratio versus work, namely the function $L(W) \\equiv \\ln\\!\\big[P_F(W)/P_R(-W)\\big]$ plotted against $W$.\n\nWhich of the following statements are valid under the stated assumptions, and which are not?

Persistent curvature of $L(W)$ versus $W$ that diminishes when previously lumped fast intermediates are explicitly resolved is consistent with coarse-grainingâ€“induced hidden entropy production; in such cases, even if the crossing point $W_{\\times}$ of $P_F(W)$ and $P_R(-W)$ yields a good practical estimate of $\\Delta F$, the slope of $L(W)$ need not match $\\beta$.\n\nC. If the best-fit slope of $L(W)$ is systematically larger than $\\beta$ by about $10\\%$ while the intercept from the same fit agrees with an independent $\\Delta F$ within errors, the most likely cause is insufficient sample size; with more samples, the curvature would persist but the slope bias would vanish.\n\nD.

A residual plot of $L(W)$ after subtracting its best-fit straight line versus $W$ should show no systematic structure if the underlying assumptions hold; if deviations from linearity are due to moderate sampling noise rather than a breakdown of the hypotheses, then a Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) analysis can still yield an essentially unbiased estimate of $\\Delta F$ with smaller uncertainty than the raw crossing point.", "solution": "**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this system is the Crooks fluctuation theorem. For a process satisfying the stated assumptions (microscopic reversibility for the CTMC, initial equilibrium distributions, and a proper definition of work), the theorem states:\n$$ \\frac{P_F(W)}{P_R(-W)} = e^{\\beta(W - \\Delta F)} $$\nwhere $\\Delta F = F(\\lambda_\\tau) - F(\\lambda_0)$ is the equilibrium free energy difference.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the function defined in the problem:\n$$ L(W) \\equiv \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_F(W)}{P_R(-W)}\\right) = \\beta(W - \\Delta F) = \\beta W - \\beta \\Delta F $$\nThis equation predicts that a plot of $L(W)$ as a function of $W$ must be a straight line. The slope of this line is the inverse temperature $\\beta$, and its y-intercept is $-\\beta \\Delta F$. The x-intercept, where $L(W)=0$, occurs at $W = \\Delta F$. We now evaluate each statement based on this theoretical prediction and its underlying assumptions.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. If the $L(W)$ versus $W$ plot is linear with slope equal to the independently known inverse temperature $\\beta$, then this supports microscopic reversibility of the dynamics and a correct definition of the stochastic work; the intercept encodes $\\Delta F$.**\n**Analysis:** The linearity of the $L(W)$ versus $W$ plot with a slope of $\\beta$ is a direct and stringent test of the Crooks theorem. The theorem's validity, in turn, hinges upon several key assumptions: the system's dynamics obey microscopic reversibility (or local detailed balance), the definitions of the forward and reverse protocols are correct, the system is initially in thermal equilibrium for both protocols, and the stochastic work is correctly defined and measured. If the experimental or computational data conform to this precise linear relationship, it provides strong evidence that these foundational assumptions are satisfied. From the linear form $L(W) = \\beta W - \\beta \\Delta F$, the intercept at $W=0$ is indeed $-\\beta \\Delta F$, which allows for the determination of $\\Delta F$.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Persistent curvature of $L(W)$ versus $W$ that diminishes when previously lumped fast intermediates are explicitly resolved is consistent with coarse-grainingâ€“induced hidden entropy production; in such cases, even if the crossing point $W_{\\times}$ of $P_F(W)$ and $P_R(-W)$ yields a good practical estimate of $\\Delta F$, the slope of $L(W)$ need not match $\\beta$.**\n**Analysis:** The Crooks theorem applies to the full, microscopically-defined system. Coarse-graining by lumping fast states into a single state can render the observed dynamics non-Markovian and, more importantly, can lead to an incomplete accounting of entropy production. The work definition based on the coarse-grained variables may miss contributions from transitions within the lumped states (\"hidden entropy production\"). This violation of the underlying assumptions leads to a breakdown of the simple linear form of $L(W)$, typically manifesting as curvature. Explicitly resolving these fast intermediates brings the model closer to the full microscopic description, recovering Markovianity and a more complete work definition, which in turn restores the linearity of the $L(W)$ plot. The point $W_{\\times}$ where $L(W_\\times)=0$ corresponds to $P_F(W_\\times)=P_R(-W_\\times)$. The Jarzynski equality, $\\langle e^{-\\beta W} \\rangle_F = e^{-\\beta \\Delta F}$, is an integral form of the Crooks theorem and can hold even when the detailed theorem (and thus the linearity of $L(W)$) fails. The crossing point $W_\\times = \\Delta F$ is also an implication of the detailed theorem and often remains a good estimate for $\\Delta F$ under certain conditions, but the slope of the curved $L(W)$ is not constant and therefore cannot be equal to $\\beta$ over any extended range of $W$.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. If the best-fit slope of $L(W)$ is systematically larger than $\\beta$ by about $10\\%$ while the intercept from the same fit agrees with an independent $\\Delta F$ within errors, the most likely cause is insufficient sample size; with more samples, the curvature would persist but the slope bias would vanish.**\n**Analysis:** This statement is logically flawed. Insufficient sample size is a source of *random statistical error*, which manifests as noise and increased variance in the estimated $P(W)$ and consequently in $L(W)$. It does not typically produce a clean, *systematic* bias of $10\\%$ in the slope. A systematic deviation of this magnitude points towards a systematic error in the experiment (e.g., miscalibration of temperature) or a failure of the model assumptions (e.g., those discussed in B or E), not a statistical artifact. Furthermore, the statement that \"the curvature would persist but the slope bias would vanish\" is contradictory. If significant curvature persists as sample size increases, it means the underlying relationship is not linear, and a single \"best-fit slope\" is a meaningless parameter. If the underlying relationship is truly linear, then with more samples, both apparent curvature and any slope bias due to noise should vanish, with the fit converging to the true line.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. If the reverse experiment is performed by starting from the nonequilibrium final distribution of the forward experiment rather than the equilibrium distribution at $\\lambda_\\tau$, then the $L(W)$ versus $W$ plot remains linear with the same slope as in the ideal case but is shifted vertically by a constant offset.**\n**Analysis:** The Crooks theorem in its standard form is critically dependent on the assumption that both forward and reverse processes begin from their respective equilibrium distributions. The initial probability of finding the system in a microstate $x_0$ for the forward process is $p_{eq}(x_0;\\lambda_0) \\propto e^{-\\beta H(x_0; \\lambda_0)}$. For the reverse process, it must be $p_{eq}(\\tilde{x}_0;\\lambda_\\tau) \\propto e^{-\\beta H(\\tilde{x}_0; \\lambda_\\tau)}$. If the reverse process starts from the non-equilibrium distribution reached at the end of the forward process, this condition is violated. The resulting work distribution for the reverse path, let's call it $P'_R(W)$, will differ in shape from the standard $P_R(W)$. Consequently, the ratio $P_F(W)/P'_R(-W)$ will not follow the simple exponential dependence on $W$ given by the Crooks theorem. A simple vertical shift in the log-ratio plot would imply $P_F(W)/P'_R(-W) = C \\cdot e^{\\beta(W - \\Delta F)}$ for some constant $C \\neq 1$, which means $P'_R(-W) = C^{-1} P_R(-W)$. This is not generally true; the shape of the work distribution depends fundamentally on the initial distribution of states. Therefore, the plot of $L(W)$ will generally change its shape and will not be a simple vertically shifted line.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. If the bath temperature drifts during the protocol in a way that is not accounted for (so the environment is nonisothermal), then the $L(W)$ versus $W$ plot can appear locally linear with an effective slope that varies with $W$; a global best-fit slope reflects a weighted average of the instantaneous inverse temperature over the support of $W$.**\n**Analysis:** The derivation of the Crooks theorem explicitly assumes an isothermal environment (constant $\\beta$). If the temperature $T(t)$ and thus $\\beta(t)$ vary during the protocol, the theorem does not apply in its simple form. The relationship between forward and reverse path probabilities becomes more complex, integrating over the time-varying temperature. Different work values $W$ may be correlated with different segments of the protocol, and thus with different instantaneous temperatures. For example, highly dissipative trajectories (large $W$) might occur preferentially during a high-temperature phase. This will cause the slope of the $L(W)$ plot to vary with $W$, reflecting some effective local temperature. A global linear fit to such a curved plot would yield a slope that is a non-trivial, weighted average of $\\beta(t)$ over the duration of the protocol. The description is physically plausible and qualitatively correct.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**F. Replacing the abscissa by the stochastic heat $Q$ while retaining the same forward and reverse histograms $P_F$ and $P_R$ is still expected to produce a strictly linear $L(Q) \\equiv \\ln\\!\\big[P_F(Q)/P_R(-Q)\\big]$ versus $Q$ with slope $\\beta$; therefore any observed curvature in $L(Q)$ indicates experimental error rather than theoretical limitation.**\n**Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Crooks theorem is a statement about the work $W$ performed on the system via the external protocol. Heat, $Q$, is a different thermodynamic quantity, related to work and the change in internal energy $\\Delta U$ by the first law, $Q = \\Delta U - W$. Both $\\Delta U$ and $W$ are stochastic variables, so $Q$ is also a stochastic variable with its own distribution, $P(Q)$, which is generally different from $P(W)$. There is no general fluctuation theorem for heat analogous to the Crooks theorem for a non-cyclic process between two different equilibrium states. The premise that a linear relationship with slope $\\beta$ is expected for heat is false. The statement seems to be based on a misunderstanding and conflation of work and heat. Curvature observed in a plot involving heat distributions would be an expected theoretical outcome, not an indication of experimental error.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**G. A residual plot of $L(W)$ after subtracting its best-fit straight line versus $W$ should show no systematic structure if the underlying assumptions hold; if deviations from linearity are due to moderate sampling noise rather than a breakdown of the hypotheses, then a Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) analysis can still yield an essentially unbiased estimate of $\\Delta F$ with smaller uncertainty than the raw crossing point.**\n**Analysis:** This statement accurately describes standard practice in statistical analysis. First, if the theoretical model (in this case, $L(W) = \\beta W - \\beta \\Delta F$) is correct, then the deviations of the data from the model fit should be random noise. A residual plot is the standard tool to check this; any systematic structure (e.g., curvature) in the residuals indicates that the model is a poor description of the data. Second, if the deviations are indeed just noise due to finite sampling, then more sophisticated estimators than the simple crossing point are desirable. The Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) is a statistically optimal method that uses all work data from both forward and reverse distributions to estimate $\\Delta F$. It is known to provide the minimum-variance unbiased estimate of $\\Delta F$ under the assumption that the Crooks relation holds. Therefore, it is both more precise (smaller uncertainty) and robust against noise than simply identifying a single, noisy crossing point.\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABEG}$$", "id": "2644022"}]}
