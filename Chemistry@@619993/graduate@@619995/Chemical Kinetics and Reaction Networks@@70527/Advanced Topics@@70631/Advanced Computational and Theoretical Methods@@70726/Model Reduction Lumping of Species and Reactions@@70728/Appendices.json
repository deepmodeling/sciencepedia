The parameter values are physically plausible and justify the use of time-scale separation (fast-slow decomposition), which is a standard and valid technique in this context. The problem is not trivial and addresses a genuine conceptual issue in model reduction. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe tasks will be addressed in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the metric.\nA metric for reaction importance should quantify the reaction's contribution to the system's behavior. A purely flux-based metric $\\phi_i$ measures the reaction's activity over a short time scale $[0, t_\\ast]$ but neglects its influence on long-term observables. The problem statement itself criticizes this approach.\n\nA sensitivity-based metric, derived from the linearized response $dy(T) \\approx \\frac{\\partial y(T)}{\\partial \\ln k_i} d(\\ln k_i)$, quantifies the impact of a relative perturbation in the rate constant $k_i$ on the observable $y(T)$. The term $\\frac{\\partial y(T)}{\\partial \\ln k_i}$ measures this impact, but a reaction could have a large impact coefficient while being nearly inactive (having near-zero flux), making its overall contribution negligible.\n\nA robust metric must combine both aspects: short-term activity and long-term impact. The \"corrected importance\" must be a function of both $\\phi_i$ and the sensitivity.\nLet the sensitivity coefficient be $S_i(T) = \\frac{\\partial y(T)}{\\partial \\ln k_i}$. The term \"importance\" implies a non-negative quantity that measures the magnitude of a reaction's role, regardless of whether it increases or decreases the observable. Thus, the magnitude of the sensitivity, $|S_i(T)|$, must be used.\n\nThe simplest way to combine the activity $\\phi_i$ and the impact magnitude $|S_i(T)|$ is through multiplication. Let us define the corrected importance metric $M_i$ as:\n$$M_i = \\phi_i \\cdot \\left|S_i(T)\\right| = \\left(\\frac{1}{t_\\ast}\\int_{0}^{t_\\ast} r_i(t)\\, dt\\right) \\cdot \\left|\\frac{\\partial y(T)}{\\partial \\ln k_i}\\right|$$\nThis metric is non-negative and is large only if both the flux and the sensitivity magnitude are significant.\nWe must verify dimensional consistency. The units of flux $\\phi_i$ are concentration per time. The units of the logarithmic sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial y(T)}{\\partial \\ln k_i}$ are the same as $y(T)$, which is concentration, because $\\ln k_i$ is dimensionless. Therefore, the units of the metric $M_i$ are (concentration/time) $\\times$ (concentration) = concentration$^2$/time. The problem asks for the final answer in micromolar squared per second, confirming this construction is dimensionally correct.\n\nTask 2: Evaluation of $\\phi_3$.\nThe parameter values $k_2=50\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_4=50\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ are much larger than $k_3=10^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the effective rate from the source term $k_1$. This justifies a fast-slow decomposition. The reactions $\\mathrm{R2}$ and $\\mathrm{R4}$ constitute a fast subsystem. The fast dynamics, occurring on a time scale of order $(k_2+k_4)^{-1} = (100)^{-1} = 0.01\\ \\text{s}$, drive the system to a quasi-steady state where $k_2 X(t) \\approx k_4 Y(t)$, hence $Y(t) \\approx \\frac{k_2}{k_4} X(t)$.\n\nThe slow dynamics are described by the total concentration of the fast species, $Z(t) = X(t) + Y(t)$.
