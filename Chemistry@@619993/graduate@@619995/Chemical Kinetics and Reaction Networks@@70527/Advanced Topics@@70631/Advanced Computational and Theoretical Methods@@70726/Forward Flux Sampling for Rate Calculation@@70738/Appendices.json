The following exercise [@problem_id:2645590] guides you through the process of building a simulation from the ground up to estimate this flux for a canonical birth-death process, giving you hands-on practice with the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) and the specific reinjection logic that underpins this first crucial FFS stage.", "problem": "Design a program that estimates the first-crossing flux in Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) for a one-dimensional birth–death chemical reaction network simulated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). The first-crossing flux from basin $A$ to the first interface $\\lambda_{0}$, denoted $\\Phi_{A,0}$, is defined as the long-time limit of the number of first hits to $\\lambda_{0}$ per unit SSA time, under a reinjection protocol that restarts the system in $A$ after either a successful first hit to $\\lambda_{0}$ or a return to $A$ without a hit. You must implement a statistically correct estimator for $\\Phi_{A,0}$ using this protocol.\n\nUse the following chemical kinetics model with one species $X$ and copy number $n \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$:\n- Birth reaction: $\\varnothing \\to X$ with rate constant $k_{\\text{b}}$ (units: $\\text{s}^{-1}$), propensity $a_{1}(n) = k_{\\text{b}}$.\n- Death reaction: $X \\to \\varnothing$ with rate constant $k_{\\text{d}}$ (units: $\\text{s}^{-1}$), propensity $a_{2}(n) = k_{\\text{d}} \\, n$.\n\nSimulate the continuous-time Markov chain via the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) (Gillespie algorithm). At state $n$, the total propensity is $a_{0}(n) = a_{1}(n) + a_{2}(n) = k_{\\text{b}} + k_{\\text{d}} \\, n$. The SSA waiting time increment is an exponential random variable with rate $a_{0}(n)$, and the reaction channel is chosen with probabilities proportional to propensities.\n\nDefine the order parameter $\\lambda(n) = n$. Define the basin $A = \\{ n \\mid n \\leq n_{A} \\}$ for a given integer threshold $n_{A} \\geq 0$, and the first interface $\\lambda_{0} = \\{ n \\mid n \\geq n_{0} \\}$ for a given integer $n_{0} > n_{A}$. Starting in $A$, run the SSA and track excursions that begin when the trajectory leaves $A$. For each excursion, stop the excursion when the trajectory reaches either $\\lambda_{0}$ (count one first hit) or returns to $A$ (count zero).

Therefore, the reinjection distribution restricted to $A$ is the Poisson distribution truncated to $\\{0,1,\\dots,n_{A}\\}$ with probabilities proportional to $\\mu^{n}/n!$ on that set. Your program must sample reinjection states from this truncated distribution.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- Simulate the SSA exactly as defined above for a total simulated SSA time $T_{\\text{sim}}$ for each case, using the reinjection protocol after every excursion outcome.\n- Count first hits to $\\lambda_{0}$ only when an excursion reaches any $n \\in \\{ n_{0}, n_{0}+1, \\dots \\}$ before returning to $n \\leq n_{A}$.\n- Accumulate the SSA time continuously over all steps including time spent both in $A$ and in excursions.\n- Use a fixed random number generator seed as specified per test case to ensure deterministic output.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide results for the following four cases.

The concept of first-crossing flux and its estimation using a brute-force simulation with reinjection is a fundamental component of the Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) methodology for rare-event simulations. The use of a truncated Poisson distribution for reinjection is consistent with the process's known stationary properties.\n\nThe problem is **well-posed**. It provides all necessary parameters ($k_{\\text{b}}$, $k_{\\text{d}}$, $n_A$, $n_0$, $T_{\\text{sim}}$), initial conditions (via the reinjection protocol), and a deterministic element (a fixed random number generator seed) for each case, ensuring a unique and reproducible computational result.\n\nThe problem is **objective** and complete, with no ambiguity in its definitions or requirements. All terms are formally defined within the context of chemical kinetics and stochastic processes. The provided test cases are logical and cover different physical regimes, including a boundary case ($n_0 = n_A+1$) and a rare-event scenario, making the problem a valid test of implementation correctness.\n\nTherefore, a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to estimate the first-crossing flux, $\\widehat{\\Phi}_{A,0} = N_{\\text{hits}}/T_{\\text{sim}}$, for a birth-death process. This requires implementing a stochastic simulation that adheres to a specific protocol defined by Forward Flux Sampling. The simulation will be based on the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA).\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a state-transition loop that runs until a total simulation time $T_{\\text{sim}}$ is accumulated. The system is characterized by the copy number $n$ of species $X$. The state space is partitioned into a basin region $A = \\{n \\mid n \\leq n_A\\}$, a target region defined by the first interface $\\lambda_0 = \\{n \\mid n \\geq n_0\\}$, and an intermediate region $\\{n \\mid n_A  n  n_0\\}$.\n\nThe simulation logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    The simulation starts at time $t=0$ with zero hits ($N_{\\text{hits}}=0$). The initial state $n$ is not a fixed value but is drawn from a specific probability distribution to ensure the process begins in a steady state consistent with the reinjection protocol. This distribution is the stationary distribution of the unconstrained birth-death process, a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = k_{\\text{b}}/k_{\\text{d}}$, truncated to the basin $A$.\n\n2.  **Reinjection Distribution Sampling**:\n    To sample a state from the truncated Poisson distribution on $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n_A\\}$, we first compute the unnormalized weights $w_i = \\mu^i/i!$ for each state $i \\in A$. These are normalized to obtain probabilities $p_i$. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is then constructed. A state is sampled by drawing a uniform random number $u \\in [0, 1)$ and finding the state $j$ corresponding to the first CDF value greater than or equal to $u$ (inverse transform sampling).\n\n3.  **Main Simulation Loop**: The loop proceeds as long as the current simulation time $t$ is less than $T_{\\text{sim}}$.\n    a.  **SSA Step**: At a given state $n$, the total propensity is $a_0(n) = k_{\\text{b}} + k_{\\text{d}}n$. A time step $\\Delta t$ is drawn from an exponential distribution with rate $a_0(n)$. The total time is advanced, $t \\leftarrow t + \\Delta t$. If the new time exceeds $T_{\\text{sim}}$, the loop terminates to avoid counting events beyond the specified simulation window. A reaction is chosen (birth, $n \\to n+1$; or death, $n \\to n-1$) with probability proportional to the individual propensities, $k_{\\text{b}}$ and $k_{\\text{d}}n$.\n    b.  **FFS State Logic**: The simulation logic depends on whether the system was previously inside the basin $A$ or on an \"excursion\" outside of it.\n        i.  If the system leaves the basin (transitions from $n_{\\text{old}} \\le n_A$ to $n_{\\text{new}} > n_A$), an excursion begins.\n        ii. An excursion ends when the trajectory either reaches the interface $\\lambda_{0}$ ($n \\ge n_0$) or returns to the basin $A$ ($n \\le n_A$).\n        iii. If the excursion ends with a hit on $\\lambda_0$, the counter $N_{\\text{hits}}$ is incremented.\n        iv. Following any excursion termination (hit or return), the system state $n$ is immediately reset by reinjecting it into basin $A$ according to the truncated Poisson distribution described in step 2. The simulation then continues from this new state. This reinjection is an instantaneous state reset and does not advance the simulation time.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Once the simulation loop concludes, the flux estimate is computed as the total number of recorded hits divided by the total simulation time, $\\widehat{\\Phi}_{A,0} = N_{\\text{hits}} / T_{\\text{sim}}$. The result for each test case is rounded to six significant digits.\n\nThis algorithm correctly implements the specified FFS-based protocol for measuring the first-crossing flux.

A long simulation constrained to remain in $A$ is run for total time $T_A = 10^4$ time units and produces $N_{\\Phi} = 80$ first crossings of $\\lambda_1$.

FFS is a standard and powerful technique for studying rare events in stochastic systems like chemical reaction networks simulated by the SSA.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe Forward Flux Sampling method estimates the transition rate `$k_{AB}$` as a product of the initial flux out of state `$A$` and a series of conditional probabilities of reaching successive interfaces. For the given interface setup, the formula is:\n$$ k_{AB} = \\Phi_0 \\times P(\\lambda_2 | \\lambda_1) \\times P(\\lambda_3 | \\lambda_2) $$\nwhere `$\\Phi_0$` is the flux of trajectories leaving `$A$` and crossing `$\\lambda_1$` for the first time, and `$P(\\lambda_{i+1} | \\lambda_i)$` is the conditional probability that a trajectory initiated from a configuration that has just crossed interface `$\\lambda_i$` will proceed to cross interface `$\\lambda_{i+1}$` before returning to state `$A$`. We will calculate each term.\n\n**1. Initial Flux, `$\\Phi_0$`**\nThe flux is the rate of first crossings of `$\\lambda_1$` from state `$A$`.

Conditional Probability, `$P_1 = P(\\lambda_2 | \\lambda_1)$`**\nThis is the probability of a trajectory starting from a `$\\lambda_1$` crossing to reach `$\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_2$` before returning to `$A$`. The data show that from `$M_1 = 200$` trials, a total of `$S_{1,\\text{total}} = 120$` were successful. Both normal and overshoot successes satisfy the requirement of reaching `$\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_2$`.\n$$ P_1 = \\frac{S_{1,\\text{total}}}{M_1} = \\frac{120}{200} = 0.6 $$\n\n**3. Conditional Probability, `$P_2 = P(\\lambda_3 | \\lambda_2)$`**\nThis is the most critical part of the problem, as it involves the correct handling of overshoot events. The FFS algorithm is built upon a telescopic product of probabilities. The ensemble of starting configurations for the `$\\lambda_2 \\to \\lambda_3$` stage consists of all the successful endpoints from the `$\\lambda_1 \\to \\lambda_2$` stage. There are `$S_{1,\\text{total}} = 120$` such endpoints. Therefore, the number of trials for the second stage, `$M_2$`, is `$120$`.\n\nThese `$120$` starting configurations are:\n- `$S_{1,\\text{norm}} = 90$` configurations with `$\\lambda \\in [\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$`.\n- `$S_{1,\\text{over}} = 30$` configurations with `$\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_3$`.\n\nThe number of successes for the `$\\lambda_2 \\to \\lambda_3$` stage, `$S_2$`, is the number of these `$120$` trajectories that reach `$\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_3$` before returning to `$A$`.\n- The `$S_{1,\\text{over}} = 30$` overshoot configurations *already* satisfy the success criterion `$\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_3$`. They represent trajectories that have already reached the final basin `$B$`. In the context of the `$\\lambda_2 \\to \\lambda_3$` stage, they are \"zero-length\" trials that are immediate successes. Thus, they contribute `$30$` successes.\n- For the `$S_{1,\\text{norm}} = 90$` normal configurations, the problem states that simulations were run, yielding `$S_{2,\\text{sim}} = 45$` successes.\n\nThe total number of successes for this stage is the sum from both groups:\n$$ S_2 = S_{1,\\text{over}} + S_{2,\\text{sim}} = 30 + 45 = 75 $$\nThe conditional probability `$P_2$` is then the ratio of total successes to total trials for this stage:\n$$ P_2 = \\frac{S_2}{M_2} = \\frac{75}{S_{1,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{75}{120} = \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625 $$\nThis procedure correctly preserves the total probability flux through the sequence of interfaces.\n\n**4. Final Rate Calculation, `$k_{AB}$`**\nWe now combine the pieces to find the overall rate constant:\n$$ k_{AB} = \\Phi_0 \\times P_1 \\times P_2 $$\n$$ k_{AB} = 0.008 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.625 $$\nSubstituting the fractional forms is less prone to error:\n$$ k_{AB} = \\frac{80}{10^4} \\times \\frac{120}{200} \\times \\frac{75}{120} $$\nThe term `$120$` cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ k_{AB} = \\frac{80}{10000} \\times \\frac{75}{200} = \\frac{8 \\times 10}{10^4} \\times \\frac{75}{2 \\times 10^2} = \\frac{8 \\times 75}{2 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{4 \\times 75}{10^5} = \\frac{300}{10^5} = \\frac{3}{1000} = 0.003 $$\nThe correctly calculated rate is `$k_{AB} = 0.003$`.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Count any overshoot from $\\lambda_1$ that lands with $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_3$ as successes for all crossed interfaces simultaneously. Exclude these $S_{1,\\text{over}}$ endpoints from the denominator when estimating the next-stage conditional probability, since they have “already succeeded.” With this handling, the rate is $k_{AB} = 0.004$.**\nThe logic described is flawed. Excluding successful configurations from the denominator for the next stage's probability calculation violates the principles of conditional probability upon which FFS is based. The denominator for `$P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_i)$` must be the total number of successes from the previous stage, `$S_i$`. Following the option's prescription, `$P_2 = S_{2,\\text{sim}} / S_{1,\\text{norm}} = 45/90 = 0.5$`. This yields `$k_{AB} = 0.008 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.5 = 0.0024$`, which does not match the `$0.004$` claimed in the option. The option is both algorithmically incorrect and numerically inconsistent. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Count an overshoot from $\\lambda_i$ as a success for the current stage $i$ only, and insert its landing configuration into the first-crossing ensemble of the first interface it newly entered (here, $\\lambda_2$). In the next stage, treat such a configuration as a zero-length trial that is an immediate success if it already satisfies the next interface (here, $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda_3$). With this handling, the rate is $k_{AB} = 0.003$.**\nThis option describes the correct, standard procedure for handling overshoots in the direct FFS algorithm. An overshoot is a success for the current stage, and its endpoint is correctly included in the ensemble for the next stage. If that endpoint already meets the criterion for the next stage, it is properly counted as an automatic success. Our derivation, which followed this exact logic, yielded `$k_{AB} = 0.003$`. The description of the method is correct, and the numerical result is correct. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Reject overshoot events and resample the SSA step until the landing configuration lies in the slab $[\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3)$, so that every success advances by exactly one interface. With this handling, the rate is $k_{AB} = 0.0018$.**\nThis procedure is incorrect as it introduces a bias. Rejecting and resampling physical reaction steps because they are \"too large\" fundamentally alters the dynamics being sampled. The resulting path ensemble and rate estimate would not correspond to the true system. Furthermore, if one were to misinterpret \"reject\" as \"discard,\" calculating the rate by only considering the `$S_{1,\\text{norm}}=90$` successes for `$P_1$`, one gets `$P_1 = 90/200 = 0.45$`. With `$P_2 = 45/90 = 0.5$`, this gives `$k_{AB} = 0.008 \\times 0.45 \\times 0.5 = 0.0018$`. While the number matches, it is derived from an invalid procedure; discarding successful paths is a severe error. The proposed method (\"reject and resample\") is not a standard, unbiased FFS protocol. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Split the statistical weight of each overshoot event equally among all crossed interfaces and add fractional successes to each interface’s estimator. Keep all endpoints in the next-stage denominator. With this handling, the rate is $k_{AB} = 0.0021$.**\nThis proposal is an ad-hoc heuristic without a firm basis in probability theory. FFS is based on counting discrete, integer numbers of successful and failed paths. The concept of \"fractional successes\" or \"splitting weight\" is foreign to the standard formulation and corrupts its clean probabilistic interpretation. It is not possible to derive the rate $0.0021$ from any rigorous application of statistical mechanics principles. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2645582"}, {"introduction": "A numerical estimate is only as useful as its stated precision. Since the Forward Flux Sampling rate constant $\\hat{k}_{AB}$ is a product of several statistically estimated quantities, quantifying the uncertainty in the final result requires a careful propagation of errors.

By applying the delta method on a logarithmic scale, you will develop the essential formula for calculating confidence intervals and understanding which parts of the simulation contribute most to the overall error.", "problem": "Consider a rare-event transition in a stochastic reaction network from a stable set of states $A$ to a disjoint set $B$, monitored by an order parameter $\\lambda$ with interfaces $\\lambda_{0}  \\lambda_{1}  \\cdots  \\lambda_{n}$ such that the basins are defined as $A = \\{\\mathbf{n} \\mid \\lambda(\\mathbf{n})  \\lambda_{0}\\}$ and $B = \\{\\mathbf{n} \\mid \\lambda(\\mathbf{n}) \\ge \\lambda_{n}\\}$. In Forward Flux Sampling (FFS), the rate constant $k_{AB}$ is represented as $k_{AB} = \\Phi_{A,0}\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} p_{i}$, where $\\Phi_{A,0}$ is the steady-state flux of trajectories leaving $A$ and crossing $\\lambda_{0}$, and $p_{i}$ is the conditional probability that a trajectory starting at $\\lambda_{i}$ reaches $\\lambda_{i+1}$ before returning to $A$.

It is a well-posed problem in statistical analysis as applied to computational chemical physics, specifically the Forward Flux Sampling method. All assumptions and definitions are scientifically sound, internally consistent, and sufficient for the derivation requested. We proceed to solve the problem from first principles.\n\nThe rate constant for the transition from state $A$ to state $B$, denoted $k_{AB}$, is given by the product form:\n$$ k_{AB} = \\Phi_{A,0} \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} p_{i} $$\nWe are given a set of estimators for the parameters: $\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}$ for the flux $\\Phi_{A,0}$, and $\\hat{p}_i$ for the conditional probabilities $p_i$, for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$. The estimator for the rate constant is the plug-in estimator:\n$$ \\hat{k}_{AB} = \\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0} \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\hat{p}_{i} $$\nTo derive a confidence interval, we work on the logarithmic scale as instructed. Let $h$ be the function that maps the parameters to the logarithm of the rate constant:\n$$ \\ln(k_{AB}) = \\ln\\left(\\Phi_{A,0} \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} p_{i}\\right) = \\ln(\\Phi_{A,0}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln(p_i) $$\nLet us define the vector of parameters as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_n)^T$, where $\\theta_0 = \\Phi_{A,0}$ and $\\theta_i = p_{i-1}$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The corresponding vector of estimators is $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = (\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}, \\hat{p}_0, \\dots, \\hat{p}_{n-1})^T$. There are $n+1$ parameters in total. The function of interest is $h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\ln(\\theta_0) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(\\theta_i)$.\n\nThe problem requires the use of the multivariate first-order delta method. This method provides an approximation for the mean and variance of a function of a random vector. Given a random vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ that is asymptotically normal with mean $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}$, and a function $h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ that is continuously differentiable at $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, the random variable $h(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$ is asymptotically normal with mean $h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and variance given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(h(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})) \\approx [\\nabla h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})]^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}} [\\nabla h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})] $$\nwhere $\\nabla h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is the gradient vector of $h$ evaluated at the true parameter values $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gradient of $h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\ln(\\Phi_{A,0}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln(p_i)$. The components of the gradient are the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial \\Phi_{A,0}} = \\frac{1}{\\Phi_{A,0}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial p_j} = \\frac{1}{p_j} \\quad \\text{for } j \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\} $$\nThus, the gradient vector is:\n$$ \\nabla h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\Phi_{A,0}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{p_0} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{1}{p_{n-1}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we construct the covariance matrix of the estimators, $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}} = \\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$. The problem states the crucial assumption that the estimators $\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}, \\hat{p}_0, \\dots, \\hat{p}_{n-1}$ are asymptotically independent. This implies that their covariances are zero, and the covariance matrix is diagonal:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})  0  \\cdots  0 \\\\ 0  \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_0)  \\cdots  0 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\ 0  0  \\cdots  \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_{n-1}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow we substitute the gradient and the covariance matrix into the delta method formula for the variance of $\\ln(\\hat{k}_{AB}) = h(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}) \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\Phi_{A,0}}  \\frac{1}{p_0}  \\cdots  \\frac{1}{p_{n-1}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})  0  \\cdots  0 \\\\ 0  \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_0)  \\cdots  0 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\ 0  0  \\cdots  \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_{n-1}) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\Phi_{A,0}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{p_0} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{1}{p_{n-1}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Phi_{A,0}^2} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}) + \\frac{1}{p_0^2} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_0) + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{p_{n-1}^2} \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_{n-1}) $$\nThis can be written in a compact form:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}) \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})}{\\Phi_{A,0}^2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_i)}{p_i^2} $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}{E[X]^2}$ is the square of the coefficient of variation (relative error). The variance of the logarithm of the product is approximately the sum of the squared coefficients of variation of its independent components.\n\nTo obtain a practical formula for the standard error, we use the plug-in principle. We replace the unknown true parameters ($\\Phi_{A,0}$, $p_i$) and their true variances ($\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})$, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}_i)$) with their sample estimates. The estimated variance, denoted $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB})$, is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}) = \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})}{\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}^2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{p}_i)}{\\hat{p}_i^2} $$\nThe asymptotic standard error of $\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}$, denoted $\\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB})$, is the square root of this estimated variance.\n\nThe regularity condition for the validity of the delta method is that the function $h$ must be continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of the true parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. Our function is $h(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\ln(\\Phi_{A,0}) + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln(p_i)$. Its partial derivatives, $\\frac{1}{\\Phi_{A,0}}$ and $\\frac{1}{p_i}$, are continuous provided that $\\Phi_{A,0}  0$ and $p_i  0$ for all $i$. These conditions are physically necessary for the transition to be possible; a zero flux or a zero probability for crossing an interface would mean the overall rate constant $k_{AB}$ is zero, which is a trivial case not involving rare events. Thus, we assume these parameters are strictly positive.\n\nWith the standard error, an asymptotic $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\ln(k_{AB})$ is constructed based on the asymptotic normality of $\\ln(\\hat{k}_{AB})$:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{k}_{AB}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}) $$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. Exponentiating the endpoints of this interval yields the confidence interval for $k_{AB}$.\n\nThe final requested quantity is the closed-form expression for the asymptotic standard error of $\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}$. This is the square root of the plug-in estimated variance derived above.\n$$ \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln \\hat{k}_{AB}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})}{\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}^2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{p}_i)}{\\hat{p}_i^2}} $$\nThis expression is the final answer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0})}{\\hat{\\Phi}_{A,0}^2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{p}_i)}{\\hat{p}_i^2}}} $$", "id": "2645555"}]}
