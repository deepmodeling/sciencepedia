The equation is thus\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}p_{e}(t) = -(k * p_{e})(t)\n$$\nWe apply the one-sided Laplace transform $\\mathcal{L}$ to both sides of this equation. Let $P_{e}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{p_{e}(t)\\}(s)$ and $K(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{k(t)\\}(s)$.\n\nUsing the property of the Laplace transform for derivatives, $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{d}{dt}f(t)\\}(s) = sF(s) - f(0)$, the left-hand side transforms as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}p_{e}(t)\\right\\}(s) = s P_{e}(s) - p_{e}(0)\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $p_{e}(0)=1$, this becomes $s P_{e}(s) - 1$.\n\nUsing the convolution theorem, $\\mathcal{L}\\{(f * g)(t)\\}(s) = F(s)G(s)$, the right-hand side transforms as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{-(k * p_{e})(t)\\}(s) = -K(s)P_{e}(s)\n$$\nWe must first compute $K(s)$, the Laplace transform of the kernel $k(t) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\nu t)$:\n$$\nK(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\kappa \\exp(-\\nu t)\\}(s) = \\kappa \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-st) \\exp(-\\nu t) dt = \\kappa \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(s+\\nu)t) dt = \\frac{\\kappa}{s+\\nu}\n$$\nThis result holds for $\\text{Re}(s+\\nu) > 0$.\n\nNow, we equate the transformed left and right sides to obtain an algebraic equation for $P_{e}(s)$:\n$$\ns P_{e}(s) - 1 = -\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{s+\\nu}\\right) P_{e}(s)\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $P_{e}(s)$:\n$$\ns P_{e}(s) + \\frac{\\kappa}{s+\\nu} P_{e}(s) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_{e}(s) \\left( s + \\frac{\\kappa}{s+\\nu} \\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_{e}(s) \\left( \\frac{s(s+\\nu) + \\kappa}{s+\\nu} \\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nP_{e}(s) = \\frac{s+\\nu}{s^2 + \\nu s + \\kappa}\n$$\nTo find $p_{e}(t)$, we must perform the inverse Laplace transform of $P_{e}(s)$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Equations of Motion**\nThe dynamics of the system density operator $\\rho(t)$ are described by the Redfield master equation. We work in the Schrödinger picture. The general form of the Redfield equation without the secular approximation couples populations of the excited states to their coherences. For a V-system with parallel transition dipoles, as specified by the form of $H_{SB}$, the interaction with the bath cannot distinguish between the two excited states, leading to collective decay effects.\n\nThe problem guides us to find equations whose coefficients depend on $\\chi(\\Delta,\\Lambda)$. This factor arises from the real part of the one-sided Fourier transform of the bath correlation function at the frequency $\\Delta = E_1 - E_2$:\n$$\n\\text{Re} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}\\tau \\, C(\\tau) e^{i \\Delta \\tau} \\right] = \\text{Re} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}\\tau \\, \\frac{\\gamma \\Lambda}{2} e^{(-\\Lambda + i\\Delta)\\tau} \\right] = \\text{Re} \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma \\Lambda}{2} \\frac{1}{\\Lambda - i\\Delta} \\right] = \\frac{\\gamma \\Lambda}{2} \\frac{\\Lambda}{\\Lambda^2 + \\Delta^2} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\chi(\\Delta,\\Lambda)\n$$\nThis term typically appears in non-secular master equations and describes bath-induced coupling between states separated by energy $\\Delta$. While a full, rigorous derivation of the Redfield tensor is complex, the structure of the problem and the hint strongly suggest a well-established model where population-coherence coupling is governed by this term. In the limit where the central transition frequency $\\omega_0$ is large compared to $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$, the individual decay rates become approximately equal, while the cross-coupling terms retain their dependence on the energy difference $\\Delta$.\n\nLet us posit the simplified non-secular Redfield equations for the excited-state density matrix elements $\\rho_{11}, \\rho_{22}, \\rho_{12}$. We assume a dominant population decay rate $\\gamma$ and a population-coherence coupling rate proportional to $\\gamma\\chi(\\Delta,\\Lambda)$.

The second terms, proportional to $\\chi$, represent the non-secular coupling between populations and coherences, which is the source of positivity violation.\n\n**Part 2: Short-Time Dynamics and Positivity Violation**\nThe initial state is given by $\\lvert \\psi(0) \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon} \\, \\lvert 1 \\rangle + \\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon} \\, \\lvert 2 \\rangle$, where $0 < \\varepsilon \\ll 1$.

We are interested in the leading order in $\\varepsilon$. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, $\\varepsilon$ is of a higher order than $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$. Thus, the dominant term in the derivative is the one proportional to $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\rho_{11}}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} \\approx -\\gamma \\chi(\\Delta, \\Lambda) \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe short-time expansion of $\\rho_{11}(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\rho_{11}(t) \\approx \\rho_{11}(0) + t \\left. \\frac{d\\rho_{11}}{dt} \\right|_{t=0} = \\varepsilon - \\gamma \\chi(\\Delta, \\Lambda) \\sqrt{\\varepsilon} t\n$$\nThe population $\\rho_{11}(t)$ becomes negative when the second term overcomes the first.

We need to minimize the expression for $t_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ with respect to the ratio $\\Delta/\\Lambda$:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{neg}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}{\\gamma} \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Lambda}\\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe minimum value of this expression occurs when the term $(\\Delta/\\Lambda)^2$ is minimal, which is zero. This corresponds to the regime:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Lambda} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\Delta \\ll \\Lambda\n$$\nThis regime corresponds to a small energy splitting between the excited states compared to the bath cutoff frequency. The bath correlation time, $\\tau_B \\sim 1/\\Lambda$, is much shorter than the period of the quantum beats between the excited states, $\\tau_S \\sim 1/\\Delta$.\n\nScientifically, this regime is known to be problematic for second-order perturbative master equations like the Redfield equation. The secular approximation, which is often used to ensure the complete positivity of the resulting master equation (yielding the GKSL form), is valid when the energy splittings of the system are large compared to the relaxation rates ($\\Delta \\gg \\gamma$). Conversely, when $\\Delta$ is small (specifically, on the order of or smaller than the relaxation rates), the non-secular terms that couple populations and coherences become significant. The Redfield equation accounts for these terms but does so in a way that does not guarantee the positivity of the density matrix at all times.\n\nThe condition $\\Delta \\ll \\Lambda$ means the bath is \"fast\" relative to the system's internal coherent dynamics. In this limit, the bath strongly drives transitions and coherences between the nearly degenerate levels. The initial state is a coherent superposition, and its decay is highly non-trivial. The non-secular Redfield equation attempts to capture this complex coherent-dissipative dynamics but, being a perturbative theory, fails to preserve the positivity of the density matrix under these conditions of strong non-secular coupling. The small $\\Delta/\\Lambda$ ratio maximizes the coupling coefficient $\\chi(\\Delta, \\Lambda)$, leading to the fastest onset of negative populations and signaling a severe breakdown of the Redfield approximation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}{\\gamma} \\left( 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Lambda}\\right)^{2} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2659872"}, {"introduction": "How can we be certain that a mathematical model for quantum dynamics is physically valid?

Condition for complete positivity: $J(\\Phi)$ must be positive semidefinite.\n\nValidation verdict: The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of open quantum systems and tests the fundamental condition of complete positivity for a quantum map. The presence of a negative rate, $\\gamma_x(t_0) = -0.30\\,\\mathrm{ps}^{-1}$, is not a flaw; it is the central feature to be analyzed. Checking the validity of a proposed generator is a standard and meaningful scientific procedure. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\nThe objective is to find the smallest eigenvalue of the Choi matrix $J(\\mathcal{E}_{\\delta t})$ to first order in the small time step $\\delta t > 0$. The map is $\\mathcal{E}_{\\delta t} = \\mathrm{id} + \\delta t \\mathcal{L}_{t_0}$. Let us denote the rates $\\gamma_i(t_0)$ as simply $\\gamma_i$.\n\nThe Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism is linear. Thus, the Choi matrix of $\\mathcal{E}_{\\delta t}$ is:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{E}_{\\delta t}) = J(\\mathrm{id} + \\delta t \\mathcal{L}_{t_0}) = J(\\mathrm{id}) + \\delta t J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})\n$$\nThe Choi matrix of the identity map, $J(\\mathrm{id})$, is the projector onto the maximally entangled state $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$:\n$$\nJ(\\mathrm{id}) = (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathrm{id})(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) = |\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|\n$$\nLet us denote $P^+ = |\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|$.\n\nNext, we compute the Choi matrix of the generator $\\mathcal{L}_{t_0}$. By definition:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0}) = (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathcal{L}_{t_0})(P^+) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} \\gamma_i (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes (\\sigma_i \\cdot \\sigma_i - \\mathrm{id}))(P^+)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_i \\cdot \\sigma_i$ is the superoperator acting as $\\rho \\mapsto \\sigma_i \\rho \\sigma_i$.\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0}) = \\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left[ (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) P^+ (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i^\\dagger) - P^+ \\right]\n$$\nSince Pauli matrices are Hermitian, $\\sigma_i^\\dagger = \\sigma_i$.\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0}) = \\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left[ (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) P^+ (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) - P^+ \\right]\n$$\nWe use the provided identity $(\\mathbb{I}\\otimes X)|\\Phi^+\\rangle=(X^{\\mathsf{T}}\\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ to transform the term $(\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) P^+ (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i)$.\nThe term is $(\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i)|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i)$.\nApplying the identity to the ket part gives $(\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i)|\\Phi^+\\rangle = (\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T} \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle$.\nThe bra part is $\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) = (\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}))^\\dagger = \\langle\\Phi^+|((\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T})^\\dagger \\otimes \\mathbb{I})$.\nSince $\\sigma_i$ are Hermitian, $(\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T})^\\dagger = \\sigma_i^*$.\nFor $i \\in \\{x,z\\}$, $\\sigma_i$ are real, so $\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T} = \\sigma_i$ and $\\sigma_i^* = \\sigma_i$.\nFor $i=y$, $\\sigma_y$ is imaginary, $\\sigma_y^\\mathsf{T} = -\\sigma_y$ and $\\sigma_y^* = -\\sigma_y$.\nSo, $(\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T})^\\dagger = \\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T}$ for all $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$.\nThe expression becomes $(\\sigma_i^\\mathsf{T} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i^* \\otimes \\mathbb{I})$.\nFor $i \\in \\{x,z\\}$, this is $(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})$.\nFor $i=y$, this is $(-\\sigma_y \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (-\\sigma_y \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) = (\\sigma_y \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_y \\otimes \\mathbb{I})$.\nSo, for all $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$, we have $(\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) P^+ (\\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\sigma_i) = (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})$.\nHence, we can write $J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})$ as:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0}) = \\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left[ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) - P^+ \\right]\n$$\nTo find the eigenvalues of $J(\\mathcal{E}_{\\delta t}) = P^+ + \\delta t J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})$, we find a basis that diagonalizes both $P^+$ and $J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})$. The Bell basis is such a basis. The Bell states are:\n$|\\phi_1\\rangle = |\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)$,\n$|\\phi_2\\rangle = |\\Phi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle-|11\\rangle)$,\n$|\\phi_3\\rangle = |\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle+|10\\rangle)$,\n$|\\phi_4\\rangle = |\\Psi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle-|10\\rangle)$.\n\n$P^+$ is a projector onto $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$, so in the Bell basis it is represented by the matrix $\\mathrm{diag}(1,0,0,0)$.\nNow we find the action of $J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})$ on the Bell states.\nFor any Bell state $|\\phi_j\\rangle$:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})|\\phi_j\\rangle = \\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left[ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_j\\rangle - P^+|\\phi_j\\rangle \\right]\n$$\nSince $P^+|\\phi_j\\rangle = \\delta_{j1}|\\phi_1\\rangle$, for $j=1$:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})|\\phi_1\\rangle = \\sum_i \\gamma_i \\left[ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_1\\rangle - |\\phi_1\\rangle \\right]\n$$\nThe term $P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_1\\rangle = |\\phi_1\\rangle \\langle\\phi_1|(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_1\\rangle$. The inner product is $\\langle\\phi_1|(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Tr}(\\sigma_i) = 0$.\nThus, $J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})|\\phi_1\\rangle = -\\sum_i \\gamma_i |\\phi_1\\rangle = -(\\gamma_x+\\gamma_y+\\gamma_z)|\\phi_1\\rangle$. Let $\\Gamma = \\gamma_x+\\gamma_y+\\gamma_z$. The eigenvalue is $-\\Gamma$.\n\nFor $j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $P^+|\\phi_j\\rangle=0$. The action simplifies to:\n$$\nJ(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})|\\phi_j\\rangle = \\sum_i \\gamma_i (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) P^+ (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_j\\rangle = \\sum_i \\gamma_i (\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I}) |\\phi_1\\rangle \\langle\\phi_1|(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_j\\rangle\n$$\nWe need the vectors $(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_1\\rangle$ and coefficients $\\langle\\phi_1|(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_j\\rangle$. Direct calculation shows:\n$(\\sigma_x \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle = |\\Psi^+\\rangle$, $(\\sigma_y \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle = i|\\Psi^-\\rangle$, $(\\sigma_z \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle = |\\Phi^-\\rangle$.\nAnd the coefficients $\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\phi_j\\rangle$ are non-zero only for one value of $i$ for each $j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$:\n$\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_z \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^-\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_x \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Psi^+\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_y \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Psi^-\\rangle = -i$.\n\nFor $j=2$ ($|\\Phi^-\\rangle$): The only non-zero term is for $i=z$.\n$J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})|\\Phi^-\\rangle = \\gamma_z (\\sigma_z \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle \\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_z \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^-\\rangle = \\gamma_z |\\Phi^-\\rangle \\cdot 1 = \\gamma_z |\\Phi^-\\rangle$. Eigenvalue is $\\gamma_z$.\n\nFor $j=3$ ($|\\Psi^+\\rangle$): The only non-zero term is for $i=x$.\n$J(\\mathcal{L}_{t_0})|\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\gamma_x (\\sigma_x \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Phi^+\\rangle \\langle\\Phi^+|(\\sigma_x \\otimes \\mathbb{I})|\\Psi^+\\rangle = \\gamma_x |\\Psi^+\\rangle \\cdot 1 = \\gamma_x |\\Psi^+\\rangle$.
