It is a standard problem in the theory of stochastic processes, specifically concerning the calculation of hitting probabilities for a one-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain. I will now proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nThe system is a continuous-time Markov chain on the discrete state space $\\mathcal{S} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The states $0$ and $N$ are absorbing, representing sets $A$ and $B$ respectively. For any interior state $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$, transitions are allowed only to adjacent states $i-1$ and $i+1$ with rates $k_{i,i-1} > 0$ and $k_{i,i+1} > 0$.\n\nThe committor, $q_i$, is the probability that the process, starting from state $i$, reaches state $N$ before it reaches state $0$. By definition, for the absorbing boundaries, we have the conditions:\n$$q_0 = 0$$\n$$q_N = 1$$\n\nFor any interior state $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$, we can formulate an equation for $q_i$ by conditioning on the first jump event. The total rate of exit from state $i$ is $K_i = k_{i,i+1} + k_{i,i-1}$. The probability that the next transition is to state $i+1$ is $p_{i,i+1} = \\frac{k_{i,i+1}}{K_i}$, and to state $i-1$ is $p_{i,i-1} = \\frac{k_{i,i-1}}{K_i}$.\n\nAccording to the law of total probability, $q_i$ is the weighted average of the committor probabilities of the subsequent states, where the weights are the respective transition probabilities:\n$$q_i = q_{i+1} \\cdot p_{i,i+1} + q_{i-1} \\cdot p_{i,i-1}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities:\n$$q_i = q_{i+1} \\frac{k_{i,i+1}}{k_{i,i+1} + k_{i,i-1}} + q_{i-1} \\frac{k_{i,i-1}}{k_{i,i+1} + k_{i,i-1}}$$\nMultiplying by the denominator $(k_{i,i+1} + k_{i,i-1})$ yields:\n$$q_i (k_{i,i+1} + k_{i,i-1}) = q_{i+1} k_{i,i+1} + q_{i-1} k_{i,i-1}$$\nThis is the backward master equation for the committor probability. We can rearrange this equation to reveal a simpler structure.\n$$q_i k_{i,i+1} - q_{i+1} k_{i,i+1} = q_{i-1} k_{i,i-1} - q_i k_{i,i-1}$$\n$$-k_{i,i+1}(q_{i+1} - q_i) = -k_{i,i-1}(q_i - q_{i-1})$$\n$$k_{i,i+1}(q_{i+1} - q_i) = k_{i,i-1}(q_i - q_{i-1})$$\nThis equation holds for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$.

It requires the derivation and application of the Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) rate constant estimator from first principles. The problem statement is complete, consistent, and adheres to the established framework of stochastic chemical kinetics. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental objective is to estimate the transition rate constant, denoted as $k_{AB}$, from a metastable state $A$ to another state $B$ for a system whose dynamics are described by a continuous-time Markov jump process. The transition is a rare event, meaning its direct observation in a straightforward simulation is computationally prohibitive. FFS addresses this by decomposing the rare transition path into a sequence of more probable, smaller steps.\n\nThe rate constant $k_{AB}$ represents the steady-state flux of trajectories that originate in state $A$ and successfully transition to state $B$. The core principle of FFS is to express this overall flux as a product of an initial flux and a series of conditional probabilities. Let us formalize this.\n\nWe define states $A$ and $B$ using an order parameter $\\lambda(x)$, where $x$ is the state vector of the system. State $A$ is the basin of attraction from which transitions originate, and state $B$ is the target basin. We introduce a sequence of non-overlapping interfaces defined by the order parameter: $\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_M$. State $A$ is defined as the region where $\\lambda(x) < \\lambda_0$, and state $B$ is defined as the region where $\\lambda(x) \\ge \\lambda_M$. The interfaces are ordered such that $\\lambda_0 < \\lambda_1 < \\dots < \\lambda_M$. A trajectory is considered to have returned to $A$ if its order parameter drops below $\\lambda_0$.\n\nThe transition rate $k_{AB}$ can be written as the product of two terms:\n$$k_{AB} = \\Phi_0 \\times P(B|\\lambda_0)$$\nHere, $\\Phi_0$ is the steady-state flux of trajectories originating from state $A$ that cross the first interface $\\lambda_0$. The term $P(B|\\lambda_0)$ is the conditional probability that a trajectory, having just crossed $\\lambda_0$ from $A$, will proceed to reach state $B$ (i.e., cross $\\lambda_M$) before returning to state $A$ (i.e., crossing back below $\\lambda_0$).\n\nDue to the Markov property of the process, the probability $P(B|\\lambda_0)$ can be factorized as a product of conditional probabilities between successive interfaces. A trajectory reaching interface $\\lambda_i$ from $\\lambda_{i-1}$ has \"forgotten\" its history prior to reaching $\\lambda_i$. Therefore, the probability to proceed to $\\lambda_{i+1}$ depends only on its current state. This allows us to write:\n$$P(B|\\lambda_0) = P(\\lambda_1|\\lambda_0) \\times P(\\lambda_2|\\lambda_1) \\times \\dots \\times P(\\lambda_M|\\lambda_{M-1})$$\nwhere $P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_i)$ is the conditional probability that a trajectory starting from interface $\\lambda_i$ will reach interface $\\lambda_{i+1}$ before returning to state $A$. Combining these expressions yields the central equation for FFS:\n$$k_{AB} = \\Phi_0 \\prod_{i=0}^{M-1} P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_i)$$\n\nThe FFS algorithm is a numerical procedure designed to estimate each term in this product. It consists of two main stages.\n\n**Stage 1: Measurement of the Initial Flux $\\Phi_0$**\nThis stage addresses the first term, $\\Phi_0$.\n- A long simulation is performed, with the system initialized in and equilibrated within state $A$. Let the total physical duration of this simulation be $T$.\n- We monitor the order parameter $\\lambda(x(t))$. An event is registered each time the trajectory, having been in state $A$ (where $\\lambda(x) < \\lambda_0$), crosses the interface $\\lambda_0$ in the forward direction (i.e., $\\lambda(x)$ becomes $\\ge \\lambda_0$).\n- Let $c$ be the total count of such first-crossing events over the time $T$.\n- Based on the provided definition of empirical flux, the estimator for $\\Phi_0$ is:\n$$\\Phi_0 \\approx \\frac{c}{T}$$\nThe assumption of stationarity within basin $A$ is crucial for ensuring that this time-averaged frequency is a valid estimator of the steady-state flux. The configurations of the system at the moment of each of the $c$ crossings are saved. These configurations represent an ensemble of states on the interface $\\lambda_0$ conditioned on having arrived from $A$, and they serve as starting points for the next stage.\n\n**Stage 2: Estimation of Conditional Probabilities $P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_i)$**\nThis stage estimates the product of conditional probabilities. It is an iterative procedure, proceeding from interface $\\lambda_i$ to $\\lambda_{i+1}$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, M-1$.\n- **For $i=0$**: To estimate $P(\\lambda_1|\\lambda_0)$, we perform a set of $n_0$ independent trials. Each trial is initiated from a configuration on interface $\\lambda_0$. These initial configurations are drawn from the set collected in Stage $1$. By using different starting configurations and, if necessary, different random number seeds, we ensure the trials are independent realizations of the Markov process.\n- Each of the $n_0$ trials is run until the trajectory either reaches $\\lambda_1$ (a \"success\") or returns to state $A$ by crossing $\\lambda_0$ in reverse (a \"failure\").\n- The number of successful trials, $s_0$, is counted. Based on the provided definition of conditional probability, the estimator is:\n$$P(\\lambda_1|\\lambda_0) \\approx \\frac{s_0}{n_0}$$\n- The configurations of the system at the moment they successfully reached $\\lambda_1$ are saved. These form the starting pool for the next iteration.\n\n- **For $i > 0$**: The procedure is repeated for each subsequent interface $i$ from $1$ to $M-1$. To estimate $P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_i)$, we perform $n_i$ independent trials starting from configurations on interface $\\lambda_i$. These starting configurations are drawn from the set of successful endpoints of the previous iteration (i.e., from trials that reached $\\lambda_i$ from $\\lambda_{i-1}$).\n- We count the number of successes, $s_i$, which are trials that reach $\\lambda_{i+1}$ before returning to $A$.\n- The estimator for the conditional probability is:\n$$P(\\lambda_{i+1}|\\lambda_i) \\approx \\frac{s_i}{n_i}$$\nThis iterative process generates a cascade of trajectories that progressively bridge the gap between $A$ and $B$, with the number of trajectories being pruned at each interface according to the splitting probability.\n\n**Final Estimator for the Rate Constant (Task B)**\nBy substituting the empirical estimators for the flux and for each conditional probability into the central FFS equation, we arrive at the final expression for the estimated $A \\to B$ transition rate.\nGiven:\n- The measured first-crossing count $c$ over observation time $T$.\n- For each interface index $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, M-1\\}$, the number of trials $n_i$ and the number of successes $s_i$.\n\nThe estimator for the rate constant $k_{AB}$ is:\n$$k_{AB}^{\\text{est}} = \\left(\\frac{c}{T}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{s_0}{n_0}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{s_1}{n_1}\\right) \\times \\dots \\times \\left(\\frac{s_{M-1}}{n_{M-1}}\\right)$$\nThis can be written compactly as:\n$$k_{AB}^{\\text{est}} = \\frac{c}{T} \\prod_{i=0}^{M-1} \\frac{s_i}{n_i}$$\nThis expression is the required result. It is directly derived from the fundamental definitions of flux and conditional probability, combined with the decomposition enabled by the Markov property. If $c=0$, the empirical flux is $0$, and thus the rate estimate is $0$. Similarly, if any $s_i=0$ for an $n_i>0$, the corresponding empirical probability is $0$, which makes the entire product, and thus the rate estimate, equal to $0$. This is consistent with the empirical observation that no successful paths were found beyond interface $\\lambda_i$.
