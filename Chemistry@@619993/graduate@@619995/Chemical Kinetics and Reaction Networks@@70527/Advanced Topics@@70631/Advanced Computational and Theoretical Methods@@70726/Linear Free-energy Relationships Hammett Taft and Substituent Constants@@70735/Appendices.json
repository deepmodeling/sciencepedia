The Hammett equation for this system is given as a linear relationship passing through the origin:\n$$y = \\rho x$$\nwhere $y = \\log_{10}(k/k_0)$ and $x = \\sigma$.

This is done by assessing the goodness of fit of the derived model $y = 1.911x$. A strong linear correlation indicates that a single mechanism and linear free-energy relationship are operative across the substituents.\n\nWe first calculate the values predicted by the model, $\\hat{y}_i = \\rho x_i$, for each point:\nFor $x_1 = 0.78$: $\\hat{y}_1 = (1.911)(0.78) \\approx 1.4906$\nFor $x_2 = 0.00$: $\\hat{y}_2 = (1.911)(0.00) = 0.00$\nFor $x_3 = -0.27$: $\\hat{y}_3 = (1.911)(-0.27) \\approx -0.5160$\n\nNext, we calculate the residuals, $\\epsilon_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$:\n$\\epsilon_1 = 1.51 - 1.4906 = 0.0194$\n$\\epsilon_2 = 0.00 - 0.00 = 0.00$\n$\\epsilon_3 = -0.46 - (-0.5160) = 0.0560$\n\nThe residuals are small in magnitude.

Under the OLS fit to all six points, the ortho-hydroxy point exhibits a studentized residual with magnitude near $2$ and a moderate leverage $h_i$ near $0.35$, identifying it as an outlying response relative to the linear Hammett model; refitting without it moves the estimated reaction constant (slope) toward the value implied by the para series.\nOur calculations confirm a studentized residual of $\\approx 2.00$ and a leverage of $\\approx 0.35$ for the *o-OH* point. A studentized residual of this magnitude is a common indicator of an outlier. The term \"outlying response\" is appropriate as its $y$-value deviates significantly from the trend. Refitting the data without this point changes the slope from $\\hat{\\rho} \\approx 0.92$ to $\\hat{\\rho}_{(6)} \\approx 1.22$. The new value is the one \"implied by the para series.\" The statement is a correct summary of the diagnostic analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The para-nitro point must be discarded because its leverage exceeds the common cutoff $2p/n$ for $p = 2$ parameters and $n = 6$ observations; high leverage alone suffices to diagnose a bad data point in a Hammett plot.\nThe leverage cutoff is $2p/n = 2(2)/6 = 4/6 \\approx 0.667$. The leverage of the *p-NO$_2$* point ($i=5, \\sigma_5 = 0.78$) is:\n$$ h_5 = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{(0.78 - 0.0333)^2}{0.8933} = 0.1667 + \\frac{0.5576}{0.8933} \\approx 0.1667 + 0.6242 = 0.7909 $$\nIndeed, $h_5 > 0.667$. However, the claim that high leverage *alone* is grounds for discarding a point is a fundamental misunderstanding of regression diagnostics. A high-leverage point that conforms to the model trend is a valuable point that stabilizes the regression line. The residual for the *p-NO$_2$* point is $e_5 = y_5 - \\hat{y}_5 = 0.95 - (0.1193 + 0.9230 \\times 0.78) = 0.95 - 0.8392 = 0.1108$, which is small (less than half the residual standard error $s=0.2616$). Deleting this point would be improper.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. An appropriate mitigation is to augment the single-parameter Hammett model with a second descriptor that captures ortho-specific effects, such as including Taft steric constants $E_s$ and polar constants $\\sigma^*$ in a dual-parameter regression, or adding an indicator for intramolecular hydrogen bonding, rather than simply deleting the data point.\nThis statement describes a scientifically and statistically superior approach. The deviation of the *o-OH* point is not random noise but a systematic effect rooted in specific chemical phenomena—steric hindrance and/or intramolecular hydrogen bonding—which are not captured by the standard Hammett $\\sigma$ constant. The Hammett model is misspecified for this point. Augmenting the model with terms for these effects (e.g., Taft's $E_s$ for steric effects, or an indicator variable for the hydrogen bonding) is the correct way to model the data more accurately. This approach seeks to understand the cause of the deviation rather than discarding the information. This represents best practice.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Down-weighting observations by $|\\sigma|$ or by $1/\\sigma^2$ is an appropriate way to counteract leverage and will correct the anomaly introduced by the ortho-hydroxy point.\nThis describes a form of weighted least squares (WLS). The proposed weights $w_i \\propto 1/|\\sigma_i|$ or $w_i \\propto 1/\\sigma_i^2$ are ad-hoc and problematic. Most critically, for the point where $\\sigma=0$ (the reference compound H), the weight would be infinite, which is nonsensical. Furthermore, such weighting would down-weight high-leverage points like *p-NO$_2$*, which is a well-behaved point, and give substantial weight to the anomalous *o-OH* point (with a moderate $\\sigma$ of $-0.37$). This method misidentifies the problem; the anomaly is a large residual due to model misspecification for the *o-OH* point, not a general issue of heteroscedasticity related to $|\\sigma|$. This is an incorrect application of WLS.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Cook’s distance $D_i$ for the ortho-hydroxy point exceeds $1$, indicating high influence; removing it substantially changes the slope and intercept and improves the residual structure, which is consistent with treating it as a model violation due to a special interaction. A leave-one-out (LOO) analysis would support this conclusion.\nCook's distance, a measure of influence, can be calculated for point $i=6$:\n$$ D_6 = \\frac{e_6^2}{p \\cdot MSE} \\left[ \\frac{h_6}{(1-h_6)^2} \\right] = \\frac{(0.4222)^2}{2 \\cdot 0.06845} \\left[ \\frac{0.3488}{(1-0.3488)^2} \\right] \\approx 1.30 \\times 0.82 \\approx 1.07 $$\nA value of $D_i > 1$ is a strong indicator of an influential point. Our analysis confirms that removing this point causes substantial changes: $\\hat{\\rho}$ changes from $0.92$ to $1.22$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ changes from $0.12$ to nearly $0$. A recalculation of the residuals for the $5$-point fit shows they are all very close to zero, demonstrating a vast improvement in residual structure. This entire analysis is a form of leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. The interpretation—that the point's influence stems from a model violation due to a specific chemical interaction—is perfectly sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nTherefore, statements A, C, and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2652565"}]}
