The reaction involves the reduction of an oxidized organic substrate, $S_{ox}$, by a metal complex, $M_{red}$. The overall reaction is:\n$$S_{ox} + M_{red} \\rightarrow S_{red} + M_{ox}$$\nKinetic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via an inner-sphere electron transfer mechanism, which can be described by the following sequence of elementary steps:\n\n1.  Formation of a precursor complex, $C$, where a ligand from the metal complex bridges to the substrate. This step is reversible with a forward rate constant $k_1$ and a reverse rate constant $k_{-1}$.\n    $$S_{ox} + M_{red} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} C$$\n2.  Intramolecular electron transfer within the precursor complex to form a successor complex, $P$. This is an irreversible step with a rate constant $k_{et}$.\n    $$C \\xrightarrow{k_{et}} P$$\n3.

Furthermore, the electron transfer step (step 2) is the rate-determining step for the overall reaction.

In this mechanism, step 2 is given as the rate-determining step. Therefore, the rate of the overall reaction is equal to the rate of this step:\n$$\\text{Rate} = k_{et}[C].$$\nThe concentration of the intermediate complex, $C$, can be related to the concentrations of the reactants using the pre-equilibrium approximation for step 1. Since step 1 is a rapid equilibrium, the forward and reverse rates are much faster than the rate of the subsequent step ($k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_{et}$). We can write the equilibrium expression for step 1:\n$$K_{1} = \\frac{[C]}{[S_{ox}][M_{red}]} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}.$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of the intermediate $[C]$:\n$$[C] = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[S_{ox}][M_{red}].$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[C]$ into the rate law:\n$$\\text{Rate} = k_{et}\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}\\right)[S_{ox}][M_{red}].$$\nThe problem states that the experimentally observed rate law is $\\text{Rate} = k_{obs}[S_{ox}][M_{red}]$.

For completeness, if one were to relax the strict pre-equilibrium and instead apply the steady-state approximation to $C$, then $\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_1[S_{ox}][M_{red}] - k_{-1}[C] - k_{et}[C] = 0$, leading to $[C] = \\frac{k_{1}[S_{ox}][M_{red}]}{k_{-1}+k_{et}}$.

No covalent bonds are made or broken during the electron transfer step. The general scheme is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Ox}_1 + \\mathrm{Red}_2 \\rightleftharpoons \\{\\mathrm{Ox}_1, \\mathrm{Red}_2\\} \\xrightarrow{k_{et}} \\{\\mathrm{Red}_1, \\mathrm{Ox}_2\\} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Red}_1 + \\mathrm{Ox}_2 $$\n\n2.  **Inner-Sphere Electron Transfer (ISET)**: A ligand is shared between the two metal centers, forming a covalently bridged intermediate. The electron is transferred through this bridging ligand. This mechanism requires that at least one of the reactants is substitutionally labile. Bond formation and bond breakage are integral to the mechanism.\n\nLet's analyze the experimental evidence:\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Probe (1): Ligand Integrity**\nAn inner-sphere mechanism would involve a cyanide ligand acting as a bridge between the iron center and the methyl viologen dication, forming a transient species like $[\\mathrm{MV}-\\mathrm{NC}-\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_5]^{2-}$. This implies a temporary or permanent cleavage of an $\\mathrm{Fe}-\\mathrm{C}$ bond. The results from IR, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ NMR, and HPLC-MS collectively demonstrate that the cyanide ligands remain bound to the iron center throughout the reaction. No free cyanide is detected, and no cyanation of the organic acceptor occurs. This is strong evidence *against* an inner-sphere mechanism and provides direct support for an outer-sphere mechanism, where the coordination spheres of the reactants must remain intact. The detection of the $\\mathrm{MV}^{+\\bullet}$ radical by EPR merely confirms the identity of the product and gives no mechanistic information by itself.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Probe (2): Ionic Strength Dependence**\nThe dependence of the rate constant $k_2$ on ionic strength $I$ is described by the Brønsted–Bjerrum equation. For the reaction $\\mathrm{MV}^{2+} + \\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_6\\right]^{4-}$, the reactant charges are $z_A = +2$ and $z_B = -4$. The product of charges is $z_A z_B = -8$. The theory predicts that for reactants of opposite charge, the rate constant should decrease as ionic strength increases. This is because the ionic atmosphere screens the favorable electrostatic attraction, raising the activation energy. The experimental data, showing $k_2$ decreases as $I$ increases, are in perfect qualitative agreement with this prediction for a bimolecular reaction between oppositely charged ions. This observation is consistent with both inner- and outer-sphere mechanisms, as both involve bringing the charged reactants together.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Probe (3): Bridging Ligand Probe**\nAn inner-sphere mechanism requires ligand substitution to form a bridge. The complex $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CN})_6\\right]^{4-}$ is well-known to be substitutionally inert. The experiment confirms this by showing that adding excess pyridine (a potential ligand) does not affect the reaction rate and that pyridine is not incorporated into the product. This lack of reactivity towards substitution provides further, very strong evidence that the coordination sphere of the iron complex is not breached during the reaction, arguing against an inner-sphere mechanism.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe collected evidence points unequivocally to an outer-sphere mechanism. Probe (1) shows the coordination sphere of the iron complex remains intact. Probe (3) confirms the iron complex is substitutionally inert. Probe (2) is consistent with a bimolecular reaction between the oppositely charged ions, which is the case for an outer-sphere mechanism.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\n**A. The mechanism is outer-sphere: a negative primary salt effect for oppositely charged reactants, intact cyanide ligands throughout, and absence of ligand-transfer products collectively support electron transfer without bond-making or bond-breaking at the metal.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the mechanism as outer-sphere and accurately cites the key evidence: the negative salt effect (Probe 2), the integrity of the cyanide ligands (Probe 1), and the absence of ligand transfer (Probes 1 and 3). This is the correct conclusion.\n\n**B. The mechanism is inner-sphere via a cyanide bridge: the decrease of $k_2$ with ionic strength indicates stabilization of a charged bridged activated complex; the absence of free $\\mathrm{CN}^-$ is not probative because cyanide may rapidly rebind.**\nThis proposes an inner-sphere mechanism, which is strongly contradicted by Probes (1) and (3). The argument to dismiss the spectroscopic evidence is weak and speculative.\n\n**C. The mechanism is inner-sphere because the observation of the organic radical $\\mathrm{MV}^{+\\bullet}$ by EPR implies transient covalent bond formation during electron transfer.**\nThis contains a logical fallacy. Observing the final product does not provide information about the reaction pathway. Both mechanisms would yield the same product.\n\n**D. The mechanism cannot be outer-sphere because addition of pyridine does not accelerate the reaction; outer-sphere reactions require opening a coordination site on iron by external ligands to proceed rapidly.**\nThis is based on a false premise. It is *inner-sphere* reactions that require substitution. Outer-sphere reactions proceed with intact coordination spheres. The observation supports, rather than refutes, an outer-sphere mechanism.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one consistent with all observations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2660084"}]}
