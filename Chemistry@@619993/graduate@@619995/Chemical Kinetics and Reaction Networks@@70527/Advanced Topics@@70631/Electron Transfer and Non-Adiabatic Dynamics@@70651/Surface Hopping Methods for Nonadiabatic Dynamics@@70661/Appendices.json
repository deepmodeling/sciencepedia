The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe two tasks are: $1$) to find the nonadiabatic derivative coupling vector $\\mathbf{d}_{+-}(\\mathbf{R})$ and $2$) to determine the locus of the conical intersection. Let $\\mathbf{R} = (x, y)$ be the nuclear coordinates.\n\nFirst, we must obtain the adiabatic electronic states, which are the eigenstates of the diabatic potential matrix $V(\\mathbf{R})$. The matrix is given by:\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{R}) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\Delta(\\mathbf{R}) & \\lambda \\\\\n\\lambda & -\\Delta(\\mathbf{R})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta(\\mathbf{R}) = \\kappa_x x + \\kappa_y y$.

Let $E_+(\\mathbf{R}) = \\sqrt{\\Delta(\\mathbf{R})^2 + \\lambda^2}$. Then, the adiabatic surfaces are $V_+(\\mathbf{R}) = E_+(\\mathbf{R})$ and $V_-(\\mathbf{R}) = -E_+(\\mathbf{R})$.\n\nThe corresponding eigenvectors, the adiabatic states $|\\phi_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{R})\\rangle$, can be expressed using a mixing angle $\\theta(\\mathbf{R})$. We seek a unitary transformation $U$ that diagonalizes $V$.

All necessary parameters are provided, and the rules for momentum adjustment and frustrated hops are clearly defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the momentum adjustment is the conservation of total energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy and the electronic potential energy. For a system on electronic state $k$ with nuclear momentum $\\mathbf{P}_k$ and mass $m$ at a fixed geometry $\\mathbf{R}$, the total energy is $E_{total} = \\frac{\\mathbf{P}_k^2}{2m} + E_k(\\mathbf{R})$.\n\nUpon a hop from an initial electronic state $i$ to a final state $j$, the total energy must be conserved:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{P}^2}{2m} + E_i(\\mathbf{R}) = \\frac{(\\mathbf{P}')^2}{2m} + E_j(\\mathbf{R})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{P}$ is the momentum before the hop and $\\mathbf{P}'$ is the momentum after the hop.

The equation becomes:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{P}')^2 = \\mathbf{P}^2 - 2m\\Delta E\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the momentum adjustment occurs exclusively along the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector, $\\mathbf{d}_{ij}$. Let us define the unit vector in this direction as $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{d}_{ij}}{\\|\\mathbf{d}_{ij}\\|}$.\n\nThe initial momentum vector $\\mathbf{P}$ can be decomposed into components parallel ($\\mathbf{P}_{\\parallel}$) and perpendicular ($\\mathbf{P}_{\\perp}$) to $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{P}_{\\parallel} + \\mathbf{P}_{\\perp}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{P}_{\\parallel} = (\\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}})\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}$ and $\\mathbf{P}_{\\perp} = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{P}_{\\parallel}$.

Thus, the post-hop momentum $\\mathbf{P}'$ has the same perpendicular component, $\\mathbf{P}'_{\\perp} = \\mathbf{P}_{\\perp}$.

The problem is well-posed, providing a complete set of initial conditions and differential equations required to find a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The assumptions, such as identical classical paths and a constant energy gap outside the coupling region, are standard simplifications for constructing a solvable model problem to isolate a specific physical effect. The problem is not trivial and requires a correct application of quantum dynamics principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem first asks to show that for the uncorrected dynamics, the coherence does not decay. For $t>0$, the nonadiabatic coupling is zero, so the adiabatic electronic Hamiltonian is diagonal:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} E_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & E_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation, $i\\hbar\\,\\dot{c}(t)=H\\,c(t)$, separates into two independent equations:\n$$\ni\\hbar\\,\\dot{c}_{1}(t) = E_{1}\\,c_{1}(t) \\quad \\implies \\quad c_{1}(t) = c_{1}(0)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{iE_{1}t}{\\hbar}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ni\\hbar\\,\\dot{c}_{2}(t) = E_{2}\\,c_{2}(t) \\quad \\implies \\quad c_{2}(t) = c_{2}(0)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{iE_{2}t}{\\hbar}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that all trajectories are identical, so the ensemble average $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ is trivial. The coherence $\\rho_{12}(t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\rho_{12}(t) = c_{1}(t)c_{2}(t)^{*} = c_{1}(0)c_{2}(0)^{*} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{iE_{1}t}{\\hbar}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{iE_{2}t}{\\hbar}\\right) = \\rho_{12}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{i(E_{2}-E_{1})t}{\\hbar}\\right) = \\rho_{12}(0) \\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the coherence is therefore $|\\rho_{12}(t)| = |\\rho_{12}(0)||\\exp(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar})| = |\\rho_{12}(0)|$. With initial conditions $c_{1}(0) = c_{2}(0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $|\\rho_{12}(0)| = |\\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{2}$. The magnitude remains constant at $\\frac{1}{2}$ for all $t>0$, demonstrating the lack of decoherence in this standard framework.\n\nNow, we proceed to the main task: solving the dynamics with the phenomenological decoherence correction. The evolution of the density matrix is governed by the modified Liouville–von Neumann equation for $t > 0$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}(t)=-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H,\\rho(t)]-\\Gamma\\big(\\rho(t)\\big)\n$$\nWe seek the time dependence of the off-diagonal element $\\rho_{12}(t)$. The equation for this specific element is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_{12}(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\big[H,\\rho(t)\\big]_{12} - \\big[\\Gamma(\\rho(t))\\big]_{12}\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the commutator term. Since $H$ is diagonal, $H_{jk} = E_{j}\\delta_{jk}$.\n$$\n\\big[H,\\rho\\big]_{12} = (H\\rho)_{12} - (\\rho H)_{12} = \\sum_{k} H_{1k}\\rho_{k2} - \\sum_{k} \\rho_{1k}H_{k2} = H_{11}\\rho_{12} - \\rho_{12}H_{22} = E_{1}\\rho_{12} - \\rho_{12}E_{2} = -(E_{2}-E_{1})\\rho_{12} = -\\Delta\\rho_{12}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\dot{\\rho}_{12}(t)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\big[H,\\rho(t)\\big]_{12} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}(-\\Delta\\rho_{12}(t)) = \\frac{i\\Delta}{\\hbar}\\rho_{12}(t)\n$$\nThe decoherence term is given as $\\big[\\Gamma(\\rho)\\big]_{12}=\\gamma\\,\\rho_{12}$. Combining these parts, we obtain a first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\rho_{12}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\rho}_{12}(t) = \\frac{i\\Delta}{\\hbar}\\rho_{12}(t) - \\gamma\\rho_{12}(t) = \\left(\\frac{i\\Delta}{\\hbar} - \\gamma\\right)\\rho_{12}(t)\n$$\nThis linear ODE has the general solution:\n$$\n\\rho_{12}(t) = \\rho_{12}(0)\\,\\exp\\left(\\left[\\frac{i\\Delta}{\\hbar} - \\gamma\\right]t\\right)\n$$\nThe initial condition for the coherence is found from the given amplitudes at $t=0$:\n$$\n\\rho_{12}(0) = \\langle c_{1}(0)c_{2}(0)^{*}\\rangle = c_{1}(0)c_{2}(0)^{*} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{*} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this initial condition into the solution:\n$$\n\\rho_{12}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(\\left[\\frac{i\\Delta}{\\hbar} - \\gamma\\right]t\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\gamma t\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the magnitude of the coherence, $|\\rho_{12}(t)|$.\n$$\n|\\rho_{12}(t)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\gamma t\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\exp\\left(-\\gamma t\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\exp\\left(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)\\right|\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $t$ are real, $|\\exp(-\\gamma t)| = \\exp(-\\gamma t)$. The term $\\exp(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar})$ is a complex phase factor, so its magnitude is $|\\exp(\\frac{i\\Delta t}{\\hbar})|=1$.\nTherefore, the magnitude of the coherence is:\n$$\n|\\rho_{12}(t)| = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-\\gamma t)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for the decoherence rate $\\gamma=C\\,\\frac{\\Delta}{\\hbar}$:\n$$\n|\\rho_{12}(t)| = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(- C\\,\\frac{\\Delta}{\\hbar}\\,t \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $t \\ge 0$, as at $t=0$ it correctly yields $|\\rho_{12}(0)| = \\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{C\\Delta t}{\\hbar}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2681571"}]}
