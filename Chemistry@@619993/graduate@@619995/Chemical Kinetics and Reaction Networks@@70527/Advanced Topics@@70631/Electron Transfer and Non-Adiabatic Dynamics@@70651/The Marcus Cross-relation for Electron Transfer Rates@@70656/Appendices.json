According to the Smoluchowski model for diffusion to a spherical target, the microscopic rate constant (in units of volume per time) is given by $k_{d,micro} = 4 \\pi D R$, where $D$ is the relative diffusion coefficient of the reactants and $R$ is the center-to-center encounter distance.\nThe problem gives the radii $r_A = 0.38\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $r_B = 0.52\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The encounter distance $R$ is their sum:\n$$ R = r_A + r_B = 0.38\\ \\mathrm{nm} + 0.52\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.90\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.90 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nWith the given diffusion coefficient $D = 6.8 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the microscopic rate constant is:\n$$ k_{d,micro} = 4 \\pi (6.8 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.90 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 4 \\pi (6.12 \\times 10^{-19}) \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThis rate constant must be converted from microscopic units of $\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to macroscopic, molar units of $\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). The conversion requires multiplying by the Avogadro constant $N_A$ (to convert from a per-particle to a per-mole basis) and a volume conversion factor of $10^3\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n$$ k_d = k_{d,micro} \\times N_A \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ k_d = 4 \\pi (6.12 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) \\times (10^3\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) $$\n$$ k_d = 4 \\pi (6.12)(6.02214076) \\times 10^{-19+23+3}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_d \\approx 4.6318 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nNext, we identify the activation-controlled rate constant, $k_a$. The problem states that $k_x$ is the \"intrinsic activation-controlled bimolecular electron transfer rate constant...absent diffusive transport limitations.\" This is precisely the definition of $k_a$. Therefore, we have:\n$$ k_a = k_x = 1.80 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we can compute the observed rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ using the reciprocal formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\frac{1}{4.6318 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} + \\frac{1}{1.80 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = (2.1589 \\times 10^{-10} + 5.5556 \\times 10^{-10})\\ \\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}} = 7.7145 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nSolving for $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{1}{7.7145 \\times 10^{-10}}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 1.2962 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we determine the nature of the reaction control. A reaction is diffusion-controlled if the intrinsic reaction is much faster than diffusion ($k_a \\gg k_d$), in which case $k_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx k_d$. It is activation-controlled if diffusion is much faster than the intrinsic reaction ($k_d \\gg k_a$), making $k_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\approx k_a$. We compare the values:\n$k_d \\approx 4.63 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_a = 1.80 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\nSince $k_a  k_d$, the activation step is slower than the diffusion step and is therefore the primary rate-limiting factor. The reaction is thus classified as activation-controlled, although diffusion has a notable influence as the two rates are of the same order of magnitude. The observed rate $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is slower than both individual rate constants, as expected for sequential processes.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical value of $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1.296 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe final answer is the numerical value.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.296 \\times 10^{9}} $$", "id": "2686778"}]}
