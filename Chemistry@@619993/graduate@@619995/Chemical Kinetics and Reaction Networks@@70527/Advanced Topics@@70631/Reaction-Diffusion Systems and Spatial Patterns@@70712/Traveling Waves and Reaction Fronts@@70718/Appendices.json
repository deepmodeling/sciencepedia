It is a standard, well-posed problem in dimensional analysis applied to a canonical model in chemical kinetics and transport phenomena. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and free of ambiguity. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the governing reaction-diffusion equation for the concentration field $u(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}} + k f(u)\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient with dimensions $[L^{2} T^{-1}]$, and $k$ is the reaction rate coefficient with dimensions $[T^{-1}]$. The length scale is denoted by $L$ and time by $T$. The concentration $u$ has its own units, which we can denote as $[C]$. The problem states that the reaction nonlinearity $f(u)$ has the same units as $u$, i.e., $[C]$.\n\nWe are instructed to introduce the following dimensionless variables, denoted with a hat:\n$$\n\\hat{x} = \\frac{x}{L}, \\quad \\hat{t} = \\frac{t}{T}, \\quad \\hat{u} = \\frac{u}{U}\n$$\nHere, $L$ is the given characteristic length scale, $U$ is a characteristic concentration scale which we introduce, and $T$ is a characteristic timescale to be determined. From these definitions, we express the original variables and their derivatives in terms of the dimensionless ones.\n$$\nx = L \\hat{x}, \\quad t = T \\hat{t}, \\quad u = U \\hat{u}\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, we transform the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{d\\hat{t}}{dt} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{t}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d\\hat{x}}{dx} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{x}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{x}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these transformations into the governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\frac{\\partial (U \\hat{u})}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = D \\frac{1}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} (U \\hat{u})}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + k f(U \\hat{u})\n$$\nSince $U$ is a constant characteristic concentration scale, it can be taken outside the derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{T} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{D U}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + k f(U \\hat{u})\n$$\nNow, we must properly scale the reaction term $f(u)$. The problem specifies that $f(u)$ has the same units as $u$. This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that the function itself scales linearly with the characteristic concentration $U$. We can define a dimensionless function $\\hat{f}$ of the dimensionless concentration $\\hat{u}$ as follows:\n$$\n\\hat{f}(\\hat{u}) = \\frac{f(u)}{U} = \\frac{f(U \\hat{u})}{U} \\quad \\implies \\quad f(U \\hat{u}) = U \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the transformed equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{T} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{D U}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + k U \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\nAs the characteristic concentration $U$ is non-zero, we may divide the entire equation by it, which confirms that the choice of $U$ does not influence the final dimensionless group, as required by the problem statement.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{D}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + k \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\nThe next step is to select the characteristic timescale $T$. The equation presents two natural timescales. The term $\\frac{D}{L^{2}}$ has units of inverse time and characterizes the rate of diffusion over the length scale $L$. Thus, we define the diffusion timescale as $T_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{L^2}{D}$. The term $k$ also has units of inverse time and characterizes the rate of reaction. Thus, we define the reaction timescale as $T_{\\text{react}} = \\frac{1}{k}$.\n\nTo obtain a dimensionless equation where the competition between these two processes is clear, we must scale time by one of these timescales. A standard convention is to scale the equation such that the diffusion term has a coefficient of unity. This is achieved by choosing the characteristic time $T$ to be the diffusion time, $T = T_{\\text{diff}}$.\nLet $T = \\frac{L^{2}}{D}$. Substituting this into our equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(L^{2}/D)} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{D}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + k \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{D}{L^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + k \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\nTo complete the nondimensionalization, we divide the entire equation by the coefficient of the time derivative, $\\frac{D}{L^{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + \\frac{k}{D/L^{2}} \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\nThis results in the final dimensionless form:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{t}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\hat{u}}{\\partial \\hat{x}^{2}} + \\left( \\frac{k L^{2}}{D} \\right) \\hat{f}(\\hat{u})\n$$\nThe equation is now entirely dimensionless. The term in the parentheses is the single dimensionless parameter that represents the competition between reaction and diffusion. This parameter is the ratio of the characteristic timescale for diffusion to the characteristic timescale for reaction:\n$$\n\\text{Parameter} = \\frac{T_{\\text{diff}}}{T_{\\text{react}}} = \\frac{L^{2}/D}{1/k} = \\frac{k L^{2}}{D}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group, often referred to as a Damköhler number, quantifies the relative importance of the reaction rate to the diffusion rate. If this parameter is large, the reaction term dominates diffusion. If it is small, diffusion dominates the reaction.
