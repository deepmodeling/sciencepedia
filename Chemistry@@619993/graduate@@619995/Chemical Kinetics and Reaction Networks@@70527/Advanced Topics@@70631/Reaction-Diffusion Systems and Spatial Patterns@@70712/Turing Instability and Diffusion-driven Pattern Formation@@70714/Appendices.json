We now use this specific choice of $t_0$ to determine the dimensionless diffusion coefficient for the inhibitor. We substitute the expression for $t_0$ into the inhibitor's dimensionless diffusion coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Inhibitor's dimensionless diffusion coefficient} = \\frac{t_0 D_v}{L^2} = \\left(\\frac{L^2}{D_u}\\right) \\frac{D_v}{L^2} = \\frac{D_v}{D_u}\n$$\nThe resulting nondimensional system is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = f(u, v) + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} u\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = g(u, v) + \\left(\\frac{D_v}{D_u}\\right) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}^{2} v\n$$\nThe single remaining dimensionless parameter that governs diffusion in this system is the coefficient of the inhibitor's Laplacian term.

This is equivalent to the conditions $\\mathrm{Tr}(J_k) < 0$ and $\\det(J_k) > 0$.\n\nFirst, consider the case without diffusion ($k=0$). The matrix is just $J$. The problem states the homogeneous steady state is stable, which requires:\n$1$. $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = f_u + g_v < 0$\n$2$. $\\det(J) = f_u g_v - f_v g_u > 0$\n\nFor the specific Jacobian $J=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ 4 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$, we have $f_u=1$, $f_v=-2$, $g_u=4$, $g_v=-3$.\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(J) = 1 + (-3) = -2 < 0$.\n$\\det(J) = (1)(-3) - (-2)(4) = -3 + 8 = 5 > 0$.\nThese conditions are satisfied, confirming the stability of the homogeneous steady state.\n\nNow, consider the case with diffusion ($k>0$).

Thus, $\\mathrm{Tr}(J_k) = \\mathrm{Tr}(J) - k^2(D_u + D_v) < 0$ is always satisfied.\nThis means any instability must arise from the determinant condition.

For $h(q)$ to become negative for some $q>0$, the parabola, which opens upwards since $D_u D_v > 0$, must have a minimum value that is negative. The minimum must also occur at a positive value of $q$.\n\nThe minimum of the parabola $h(q)$ occurs at $q = q_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{f_u D_v + g_v D_u}{2 D_u D_v}$.\nFor a physical instability ($k$ must be real), we require $q_{\\text{min}} > 0$. This implies $f_u D_v + g_v D_u > 0$.\nThe value of the determinant at this minimum is $h(q_{\\text{min}}) = \\det(J) - \\frac{(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2}{4 D_u D_v}$.\nFor instability, we require $h(q_{\\text{min}}) < 0$, which leads to the condition:\n$$(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 > 4 D_u D_v \\det(J)$$\n\nIn summary, the necessary conditions for a Turing instability are:\n$1$. $\\mathrm{Tr}(J) < 0$ and $\\det(J) > 0$ (stability in the absence of diffusion).\n$2$. $f_u D_v + g_v D_u > 0$ (destabilizing effect of differential diffusion).\n$3$. $(f_u D_v + g_v D_u)^2 > 4 D_u D_v \\det(J)$ (diffusion is strong enough to cause instability).\n\nNow we apply these conditions to the specific problem using $f_u=1$, $g_v=-3$, $\\det(J)=5$, $D_u=1$, and $D_v = \\delta$.\nCondition $1$ is already verified.\nCondition $2$: $(1)\\delta + (-3)(1) > 0 \\implies \\delta - 3 > 0 \\implies \\delta > 3$.\nCondition $3$: $( (1)\\delta + (-3)(1) )^2 > 4(1)(\\delta)(5) \\implies (\\delta - 3)^2 > 20\\delta$.\nExpanding the inequality:\n$\\delta^2 - 6\\delta + 9 > 20\\delta$\n$\\delta^2 - 26\\delta + 9 > 0$\n\nTo find when this inequality holds, we find the roots of the quadratic equation $\\delta^2 - 26\\delta + 9 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{-(-26) \\pm \\sqrt{(-26)^2 - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{26 \\pm \\sqrt{676 - 36}}{2} = \\frac{26 \\pm \\sqrt{640}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{640} = \\sqrt{64 \\times 10} = 8\\sqrt{10}$, the roots are:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{26 \\pm 8\\sqrt{10}}{2} = 13 \\pm 4\\sqrt{10} $$\nThe parabola $\\delta^2 - 26\\delta + 9$ opens upwards, so the inequality is satisfied for $\\delta > 13 + 4\\sqrt{10}$ or $\\delta < 13 - 4\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nWe must satisfy both $\\delta > 3$ and ($\\delta > 13 + 4\\sqrt{10}$ or $\\delta < 13 - 4\\sqrt{10}$).\nLet's approximate the roots.

The solution form reduces to $\\phi(x) = A\\cos(kx)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\phi(L) = 0$:\n$$\nA\\cos(kL) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we must have $A \\ne 0$. This leads to the transcendental equation for the admissible wavenumbers $k$:\n$$\n\\cos(kL) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are $kL = (2n-1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, the discrete set of admissible wavenumbers is:\n$$\nk_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2L}, \\quad n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\n$$\nCase 2: $k^2=0$. The ODE becomes $\\phi''(x) = 0$, with general solution $\\phi(x) = Ax+B$. The condition $\\phi'(0)=0$ gives $A=0$. Then $\\phi(L)=0$ gives $B=0$. This yields only the trivial solution $\\phi(x)=0$, so $k=0$ is not an admissible wavenumber for a non-trivial mode.\nCase 3: $k^2 < 0$. Let $k^2 = -\\alpha^2$ with $\\alpha>0$. The ODE is $\\phi''(x) - \\alpha^2 \\phi(x) = 0$, with general solution $\\phi(x) = A\\cosh(\\alpha x) + B\\sinh(\\alpha x)$. The condition $\\phi'(0)=0$ implies $B\\alpha\\cosh(0)=0$, so $B=0$. The condition $\\phi(L)=0$ gives $A\\cosh(\\alpha L)=0$. Since $\\alpha L > 0$, $\\cosh(\\alpha L) > 1$, which forces $A=0$. This again yields only the trivial solution.\n\nTherefore, the only admissible wavenumbers are given by $k_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2L}$. The smallest of these corresponds to $n=1$:\n$$\nk_{\\min} = k_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{2L}\n$$\nFor comparison, for purely Dirichlet conditions ($\\phi(0)=\\phi(L)=0$), the smallest wavenumber is $k_{\\min,DD} = \\frac{\\pi}{L}$. For purely Neumann conditions ($\\phi'(0)=\\phi'(L)=0$), the smallest non-zero wavenumber is $k_{\\min,NN} = \\frac{\\pi}{L}$.\nThus, $k_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\min,DD} = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\min,NN}$. The smallest admissible wavenumber under mixed boundary conditions is smaller. This is because the fundamental eigenmode for mixed conditions, $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi x}{2L})$, represents a quarter-wavelength fitting into the domain $[0, L]$, whereas the fundamental modes for pure Dirichlet or Neumann conditions, $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$ or $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$, are half-wavelengths. A longer wavelength corresponds to a smaller wavenumber.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we are given that the system exhibits a diffusion-driven instability for wavenumbers in the range $0 < k < k_c$. For a spatial pattern to emerge, at least one of the admissible wavenumbers $k_n$ must fall within this unstable interval. The condition is:\n$$\n\\exists \\, n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\} \\quad \\text{such that} \\quad k_n < k_c\n$$\nSince the sequence of wavenumbers $k_n$ is strictly increasing with $n$, this condition is satisfied if and only if the smallest wavenumber, $k_1$, is in the unstable range:\n$$\nk_1 < k_c\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{2L} < k_c\n$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for instability to occur. We are asked for the smallest domain length, $L_{\\min}$, for which at least one unstable mode is admissible. This corresponds to the critical length at which the system first becomes capable of supporting an unstable mode. This critical condition is met when the smallest admissible wavenumber is exactly at the upper boundary of the unstable range:\n$$\nk_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{2L_{\\min}} = k_c\n$$\nFor any length $L > L_{\\min}$, it follows that $\\frac{\\pi}{2L} < k_c$, meaning the fundamental mode $k_1$ becomes unstable. For $L \\le L_{\\min}$, all $k_n \\ge k_c$, and the system is stable to spatial perturbations. Solving for $L_{\\min}$ from the critical condition yields the required expression:\n$$\nL_{\\min} = \\frac{\\pi}{2k_c}\n$$\nThis is the minimum domain size required to observe diffusion-driven pattern formation under the specified mixed boundary conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2k_c}}\n$$", "id": "2691287"}]}
