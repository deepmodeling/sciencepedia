Second, we will determine the equilibrium concentration of species $C$ under specific conditions.\n\n(a) Nondimensionalization of the Governing Equations.\n\nWe are given the characteristic scales for length, concentration, and time.

The units of $K$ are (concentration)$^{-1}$, so $\\kappa$ is indeed dimensionless.\n\nRepeating this procedure for the other two species, $B$ and $C$, yields the analogous equations.

We are asked to find the long-time, spatially uniform equilibrium concentration of species $C$, which we will denote as $c_{eq}$. At equilibrium, the concentrations are constant in time and space, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$ and $\\nabla^2 = 0$ for all species.\n\nWe employ two fundamental principles: conservation of mass and the law of mass action at equilibrium.\n\nFirst, consider mass conservation. The reaction stoichiometry is $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$. This implies that for every molecule of $C$ produced, one molecule of $A$ and one molecule of $B$ are consumed. The quantities $a(x,t) + c(x,t)$ and $b(x,t) + c(x,t)$ represent the total concentration of elemental constituents originally from $A$ and $B$, respectively. Due to the no-flux boundary conditions, the total amount of these constituents in the closed domain must be conserved.\nThe total molar amount of \"A-matter\" is constant. Thus, the average concentration over the domain length $L$ is conserved:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L [a(x,t) + c(x,t)] dx = \\text{constant}\n$$\nAt time $t=0$, the average concentration is $\\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L [a_0 + 0] dx = a_0$.\nAt equilibrium ($t \\to \\infty$), the concentrations are spatially uniform, $a_{eq}$ and $c_{eq}$. The average concentration is $\\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L [a_{eq} + c_{eq}] dx = a_{eq} + c_{eq}$.\nEquating the initial and equilibrium states yields the first conservation relation:\n$$\na_{eq} + c_{eq} = a_0 \\quad (1)\n$$\nBy identical reasoning for species $B$:\n$$\nb_{eq} + c_{eq} = b_0 \\quad (2)\n$$\nGiven the condition $a_0 = b_0$, comparing equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ implies that $a_{eq} = b_{eq}$.\n\nSecond, we apply the law of mass action at equilibrium. With all derivatives being zero, the reaction-diffusion equations reduce to the single algebraic relation representing chemical equilibrium:\n$$\n0 = k_f a_{eq} b_{eq} - k_b c_{eq}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the definition of the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$\nK = \\frac{k_f}{k_b} = \\frac{c_{eq}}{a_{eq} b_{eq}} \\quad (3)\n$$\nWe now have a system of algebraic equations to solve for $c_{eq}$. From (1), we express $a_{eq}$ in terms of $c_{eq}$: $a_{eq} = a_0 - c_{eq}$. Since $a_{eq}=b_{eq}$, we also have $b_{eq} = a_0 - c_{eq}$.\nSubstituting these into the equilibrium condition (3):\n$$\nK = \\frac{c_{eq}}{(a_0 - c_{eq})(a_0 - c_{eq})} = \\frac{c_{eq}}{(a_0 - c_{eq})^2}\n$$\nWe must solve this equation for $c_{eq}$. Rearranging gives a quadratic equation:\n$$\nK (a_0 - c_{eq})^2 = c_{eq}\n$$\n$$\nK (a_0^2 - 2a_0 c_{eq} + c_{eq}^2) = c_{eq}\n$$\n$$\nK c_{eq}^2 - (2 K a_0 + 1) c_{eq} + K a_0^2 = 0\n$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $c_{eq}$ using the quadratic formula $c_{eq} = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, with $A=K$, $B=-(2Ka_0+1)$, $C=Ka_0^2$:\n$$\nc_{eq} = \\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 \\pm \\sqrt{(2Ka_0+1)^2 - 4(K)(Ka_0^2)}}{2K}\n$$\n$$\nc_{eq} = \\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 \\pm \\sqrt{4K^2a_0^2 + 4Ka_0 + 1 - 4K^2a_0^2}}{2K}\n$$\n$$\nc_{eq} = \\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 \\pm \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K}\n$$\nThis gives two potential solutions. We must select the physically valid one. By stoichiometry, the concentration of the product $C$ cannot exceed the initial concentration of the limiting reactant, so we must have $0 \\le c_{eq} \\le a_0$.\nLet us examine the two roots:\n1. $c_{eq,1} = \\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 + \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K} = a_0 + \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K}$.\nSince $K > 0$ and $a_0 > 0$, the term $\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $c_{eq,1} > a_0$. This root is physically impossible as it violates mass conservation, and is discarded.\n\n2. $c_{eq,2} = \\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 - \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K} = a_0 + \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K}$.\nSince $4Ka_0+1 > 1$, we have $\\sqrt{4Ka_0+1} > 1$. Thus, the numerator of the fractional term, $1 - \\sqrt{4Ka_0+1}$, is negative. This implies $c_{eq,2} < a_0$.\nAlso, since $(2Ka_0+1)^2 = 4K^2a_0^2 + 4Ka_0 + 1 > 4Ka_0 + 1$, we have $2Ka_0+1 > \\sqrt{4Ka_0+1}$, which means the numerator $2Ka_0 + 1 - \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}$ is positive. Hence, $c_{eq,2} > 0$.\nThis root satisfies the physical constraint $0 < c_{eq} < a_0$ and is the correct solution.\nThe final expression for the equilibrium concentration of species $C$ is:\n$$\nc_{eq} = \\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 - \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2Ka_0 + 1 - \\sqrt{4Ka_0 + 1}}{2K}}\n$$", "id": "2668970"}, {"introduction": "Reaction-diffusion equations are central to chemical engineering, particularly in describing the performance of porous catalysts.

This is the condition for a stationary (Type I) Turing bifurcation.\nThe determinant is:\n$$\nH(q) = \\det(\\mathbf{M}(q)) = (a-q D_u)(d-q D_v) - (b-q \\delta)(c-q \\delta)\n$$\nExpanding this, we get a quadratic in $q=k^2$:\n$$\nH(q) = (ad - bc) - q(aD_v + dD_u - b\\delta - c\\delta) + q^2(D_u D_v - \\delta^2)\n$$\nLet's define the coefficients of this quadratic $H(q) = C_2 q^2 - C_1 q + C_0$:\n$C_2 = D_u D_v - \\delta^2$\n$C_1 = aD_v + dD_u - \\delta(b+c)$\n$C_0 = ad - bc$\n\nFrom the given constraints, $C_0 > 0$ (stable kinetics) and $C_2 > 0$ (positive definite diffusion matrix). $H(q)$ is a parabola opening upwards, with $H(0) = C_0 > 0$. For $H(q)$ to become negative for some $q > 0$, its minimum must be negative, and the minimum must occur at $q > 0$.\nThe minimum of $H(q)$ occurs at $q_{min} = \\frac{C_1}{2C_2}$. For the minimum to be in the physical domain $q > 0$, we require $C_1 > 0$.\nThe value at the minimum is $H(q_{min}) = C_0 - \\frac{C_1^2}{4C_2}$. For instability, we need $H(q_{min}) < 0$, which implies $C_1^2 > 4C_0 C_2$.\n\nIn summary, the conditions for Turing instability with cross-diffusion are:\n1. $a+d < 0$\n2. $ad-bc > 0$\n3. $aD_v + dD_u - \\delta(b+c) > 0$\n4. $(aD_v + dD_u - \\delta(b+c))^2 > 4(ad-bc)(D_u D_v - \\delta^2)$\n\nCompared to the diagonal case ($\\delta=0$), the cross-diffusion term $\\delta$ modifies the effective diffusivity coupling and the overall dissipation of the system, captured by the terms $\\delta(b+c)$ and $\\delta^2$.\n\nNow we proceed with the specific parameters: $a=\\frac{1}{2}, b=1, c=-2, d=-\\frac{3}{2}, D_u=1, D_v=10$.\nFirst, we check the stability of the kinetic system:\n$a+d = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} = -1 < 0$.\n$ad-bc = (\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{3}{2}) - (1)(-2) = -\\frac{3}{4} + 2 = \\frac{5}{4} > 0$.\nThe kinetics are stable, as required.\n\nNext, we verify the stability for the diagonal diffusion case ($\\delta=0$). The instability conditions would be $aD_v + dD_u > 0$ and $(aD_v+dD_u)^2 > 4(ad-bc)D_u D_v$.\n$aD_v + dD_u = (\\frac{1}{2})(10) + (-\\frac{3}{2})(1) = 5 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} > 0$. The first condition is met.\nLHS of second condition: $(aD_v+dD_u)^2 = (\\frac{7}{2})^2 = \\frac{49}{4} = 12.25$.\nRHS of second condition: $4(ad-bc)D_u D_v = 4(\\frac{5}{4})(1)(10) = 50$.\nSince $12.25 \\ngtr 50$, the second condition is not met. The system is Turing-stable for $\\delta=0$.\n\nNow we treat $\\delta$ as a bifurcation parameter. The onset of instability occurs when the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$\n(aD_v + dD_u - \\delta(b+c))^2 = 4(ad-bc)(D_u D_v - \\delta^2)\n$$\nWe substitute the parameter values:\n$aD_v+dD_u = \\frac{7}{2}$\n$b+c = 1-2 = -1$\n$ad-bc = \\frac{5}{4}$\n$D_u D_v = 10$\n\nThe equation for the critical cross-diffusion coefficient $\\delta_c$ becomes:\n$$\n(\\frac{7}{2} - \\delta_c(-1))^2 = 4(\\frac{5}{4})(10 - \\delta_c^2)\n$$\n$$\n(\\frac{7}{2} + \\delta_c)^2 = 5(10 - \\delta_c^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{49}{4} + 7\\delta_c + \\delta_c^2 = 50 - 5\\delta_c^2\n$$\nRearranging into a quadratic equation for $\\delta_c$:\n$$\n6\\delta_c^2 + 7\\delta_c + (\\frac{49}{4} - 50) = 0\n$$\n$$\n6\\delta_c^2 + 7\\delta_c - \\frac{151}{4} = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $4$ to clear the denominator:\n$$\n24\\delta_c^2 + 28\\delta_c - 151 = 0\n$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $\\delta_c$:\n$$\n\\delta_c = \\frac{-28 \\pm \\sqrt{28^2 - 4(24)(-151)}}{2(24)} = \\frac{-28 \\pm \\sqrt{784 + 14496}}{48} = \\frac{-28 \\pm \\sqrt{15280}}{48}\n$$\nWe seek the smallest non-negative value. The positive root is:\n$$\n\\delta_c = \\frac{-28 + \\sqrt{15280}}{48}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{15280} \\approx 123.6123$.\n$$\n\\delta_c \\approx \\frac{-28 + 123.6123}{48} = \\frac{95.6123}{48} \\approx 1.9919228\n$$\nAt this value of $\\delta_c$, the condition $\\delta_c^2 < D_u D_v$ must hold: $\\delta_c^2 \\approx (1.9919)^2 \\approx 3.9677 < 10$. This is satisfied.\nAlso, the condition $aD_v + dD_u - \\delta_c(b+c) > 0$ must hold: $\\frac{7}{2} - \\delta_c(-1) = 3.5 + \\delta_c > 0$, which is clearly true for a positive $\\delta_c$.\nThe smallest non-negative value is this $\\delta_c$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\delta_c = 1.992$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.992}$$", "id": "2669034"}]}
