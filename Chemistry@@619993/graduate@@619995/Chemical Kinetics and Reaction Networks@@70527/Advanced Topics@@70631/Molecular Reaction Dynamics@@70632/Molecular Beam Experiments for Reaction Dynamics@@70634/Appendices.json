A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Flux-Weighted Speed Distribution $f_F(v)$**\nThe three-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for a gas in equilibrium at temperature $T$ gives the probability density of finding a molecule with velocity components in the range $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ to $(v_x + dv_x, v_y + dv_y, v_z + dv_z)$. It is given by:\n$$\nf_{\\text{MB}}(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z = N \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right) \\, dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number density.\nThe rate at which molecules with a specific velocity vector $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ cross an aperture of area $dA$ in the $xy$-plane is proportional to the number of such molecules that can reach the aperture in time $dt$. This number is contained in a volume $dA \\cdot |v_z| \\cdot dt$. Therefore, the flux (number per unit area per unit time) is proportional to $|v_z| f_{\\text{MB}}(v_x, v_y, v_z)$. Since molecules only cross from the reservoir into the vacuum, we consider only $v_z > 0$.\nThe unnormalized velocity distribution of molecules in the effusive beam, $\\mathcal{F}(v_x, v_y, v_z)$, is thus proportional to $v_z f_{\\text{MB}}(v_x, v_y, v_z)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(v_x, v_y, v_z) \\propto v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right), \\quad \\text{for } v_z > 0\n$$\nTo find the speed distribution, we transform to spherical coordinates in velocity space, where $v_x = v \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi$, $v_y = v \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi$, $v_z = v \\cos\\theta$, and the volume element is $dv_x \\, dv_y \\, dv_z = v^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dv \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The condition $v_z > 0$ restricts the polar angle to $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi/2$. The speed is $v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}$.\nThe unnormalized distribution in spherical coordinates is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(v, \\theta, \\phi) \\propto (v \\cos\\theta) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) v^2 \\sin\\theta\n$$\nTo obtain the unnormalized speed distribution, $g_F(v)$, we integrate over the angular variables $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$:\n$$\ng_F(v) \\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} v^3 \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) d\\theta \\, d\\phi\n$$\nThe integral separates:\n$$\ng_F(v) \\propto v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta\\right)\n$$\nThe angular integrals evaluate to constants: $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi$ and $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\right]_0^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Their product is $\\pi$, a constant which can be absorbed into the proportionality constant.\nThus, the unnormalized flux-weighted speed distribution is:\n$$\ng_F(v) = C v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the normalized probability density $f_F(v)$, we must enforce the condition $\\int_0^\\infty f_F(v) \\, dv = 1$. Let $f_F(v) = C' g_F(v)$.\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv = 1/C'\n$$\nThis is a standard integral of the form $\\int_0^\\infty x^{2n+1} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\frac{n!}{2a^{n+1}}$. Here, $n=1$ and $a = \\frac{m}{2k_B T}$.\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv = \\frac{1!}{2\\left(\\frac{m}{2k_B T}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\frac{m^2}{4(k_B T)^2}} = \\frac{2(k_B T)^2}{m^2}\n$$\nThe normalization constant is the reciprocal of this value: $C' = \\frac{m^2}{2(k_B T)^2}$.\nThe normalized flux-weighted speed probability density is therefore:\n$$\nf_F(v) = \\frac{m^2}{2(k_B T)^2} v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Terminal Supersonic Speed $u_{\\infty}$**\nFor a steady-flow isentropic expansion of an ideal gas from a reservoir into a vacuum, the specific enthalpy is conserved along a streamline. The stagnation enthalpy per unit mass, $h_0$, is the sum of the static enthalpy per unit mass, $h$, and the specific kinetic energy, $\\frac{1}{2}u^2$, where $u$ is the directed flow speed.\n$$\nh_0 = h + \\frac{1}{2}u^2\n$$\nIn the reservoir (state $0$), the gas is static ($u_0 = 0$) and at temperature $T_0=T$. In the terminal state (state $\\infty$), the gas has speed $u_{\\infty}$ and static temperature $T_{\\infty}$. Conservation of energy implies $h_0 = h_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\infty}^2$.\nThe specific enthalpy of an ideal gas is $h = c_p T_{\\text{static}}$. Thus, $h_0 = c_p T_0 = c_p T$. The energy balance becomes:\n$$\nc_p T = c_p T_{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\infty}^2\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that in the high-Mach-number limit of the expansion, the terminal static temperature vanishes: $T_{\\infty} \\to 0$. This corresponds to the complete conversion of initial thermal energy into directed kinetic energy. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nc_p T = \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\infty}^2\n$$\nSolving for the terminal speed $u_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nu_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{2 c_p T}\n$$\nUsing the provided relation for the specific heat capacity per unit mass, $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma k_B}{(\\gamma - 1)m}$:\n$$\nu_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{2 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma k_B}{(\\gamma-1)m}\\right) T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Ratio $r(\\gamma) = v_{\\mathrm{mp}}/u_{\\infty}$**\nFirst, we find the most probable speed, $v_{\\mathrm{mp}}$, of the effusive flux-weighted distribution $f_F(v)$ by finding the maximum of the function. We take the derivative of $f_F(v)$ with respect to $v$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{d f_F(v)}{dv} = \\frac{d}{dv} \\left[ \\frac{m^2}{2(k_B T)^2} v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nIgnoring the constant prefactor:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dv} \\left[ v^3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) \\right] = 3v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) + v^3 \\left(-\\frac{2mv}{2k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFactoring out common terms for $v \\neq 0$:\n$$\n3v^2 - \\frac{mv^4}{k_B T} = 0\n$$\n$$\n3 = \\frac{mv^2}{k_B T}\n$$\nSolving for $v$, which is $v_{\\mathrm{mp}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{mp}}^2 = \\frac{3k_B T}{m} \\quad \\implies \\quad v_{\\mathrm{mp}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}\n$$\nNow, we form the dimensionless ratio $r(\\gamma) = v_{\\mathrm{mp}}/u_{\\infty}$ using the expressions derived.\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{mp}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\nr(\\gamma) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{3k_B T}{m}}{\\frac{2\\gamma k_B T}{m(\\gamma-1)}}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common terms ($k_B$, $T$, $m$):\n$$\nr(\\gamma) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{1} \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2\\gamma}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3(\\gamma-1)}{2\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the ratio in terms of the heat-capacity ratio $\\gamma$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{3(\\gamma-1)}{2\\gamma}}}\n$$", "id": "2656999"}, {"introduction": "Once a molecular beam is generated, it must traverse a vacuum apparatus to a reaction or detection zone without being significantly perturbed by background gas collisions.

The potential is given as $V(r) = \\kappa/r$.\n\nWe can express $\\dot{r}$ from the energy conservation equation by substituting $\\dot{\\phi} = L/(\\mu r^2)$:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{r} $$\n$$ \\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu}\\left(E - \\frac{\\kappa}{r} - \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2}\\right)} $$\nThe trajectory is symmetric about the point of closest approach, $r_{min}$, where $\\dot{r}=0$. The angle swept by the position vector from $r=\\infty$ to $r=r_{min}$ is $\\phi_{min}$. The total angle of deflection of the asymptote of the trajectory is $2\\phi_{min}$, and the scattering angle $\\Theta$ is given by $\\Theta = |\\pi - 2\\phi_{min}|$. For a repulsive potential, the trajectory bends away from the center, so $2\\phi_{min} < \\pi$, which means $\\Theta = \\pi - 2\\phi_{min}$.\n\nTo find $\\phi_{min}$, we integrate $d\\phi$ from the initial state ($r=\\infty$) to the point of closest approach ($r=r_{min}$):\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\int_{t(r=\\infty)}^{t(r=r_{min})} \\dot{\\phi} \\, dt = \\int_{\\infty}^{r_{min}} \\frac{L}{\\mu r^2} \\frac{dt}{dr} \\, dr $$\nUsing $dt/dr = 1/\\dot{r}$ and reversing the limits of integration:\n$$ \\phi_{min} = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r_{min}} \\frac{L/(\\mu r^2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu}\\left(E - \\frac{\\kappa}{r} - \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2}\\right)}} \\, dr = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{L/r^2}{\\sqrt{2\\mu\\left(E - \\frac{\\kappa}{r} - \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2}\\right)}} \\, dr $$\nSubstitute $L=\\mu v b$ and $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$:\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\mu v b)/r^2}{\\sqrt{2\\mu E - \\frac{2\\mu\\kappa}{r} - \\frac{(\\mu v b)^2}{r^2}}} \\, dr = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{b/r^2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{\\mu v^2} - \\frac{2\\kappa}{\\mu v^2 r} - \\frac{b^2}{r^2}}} \\, dr $$\nSubstituting $\\mu v^2 = 2E$:\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{b/r^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\kappa}{Er} - \\frac{b^2}{r^2}}} \\, dr $$\nThe lower limit $r_{min}$ is found by setting the term inside the square root to zero (since $\\dot{r}=0$ at this point). Let $u=1/r$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\int_0^{1/r_{min}} \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\kappa}{E}u - b^2 u^2}} \\, du $$\nCompleting the square in the denominator:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{\\kappa}{E}u - b^2 u^2 = 1 + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{4E^2 b^2} - b^2\\left(u + \\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb^2}\\right)^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{4E^2 b^2}\\right) - \\left(bu + \\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb}\\right)^2 $$\nLet the variable of integration be $y = bu + \\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb}$, so $dy = b\\,du$. Let $A^2 = 1 + \\frac{\\kappa^2}{4E^2 b^2}$. The integral is transformed to:\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\int_{y(u=0)}^{y(u=1/r_{min})} \\frac{dy}{\\sqrt{A^2 - y^2}} = \\left[\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{y}{A}\\right)\\right]_{y_0}^{y_1} $$\nThe limits are:\nLower limit ($u=0$): $y_0 = \\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb}$.\nUpper limit ($u=1/r_{min}$): here, the radicand is zero, so $y_1^2 = A^2$, which gives $y_1=A$.\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\arcsin(1) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa/(2Eb)}{A}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa/(2Eb)}{\\sqrt{1 + \\kappa^2/(4E^2 b^2)}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi_{min} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\sqrt{4E^2 b^2 + \\kappa^2}}\\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\arcsin(z) + \\arccos(z) = \\pi/2$, this is $\\phi_{min} = \\arccos(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\sqrt{4E^2b^2 + \\kappa^2}})$.\nA more convenient form uses $\\arcsin(z) = \\arctan(z/\\sqrt{1-z^2})$, which gives $\\phi_{min} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(\\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb})$.\n\nNow we find the deflection function $\\Theta(b)$:\n$$ \\Theta(b) = \\pi - 2\\phi_{min} = \\pi - 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb}\\right)\\right) = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb}\\right) $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we invert this relation to find $b(\\Theta)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Theta}{2} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb}\\right) $$\n$$ \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2Eb} \\implies b(\\Theta) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2E} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right) $$\nThis is the impact parameter as a function of the scattering angle.\n\nFinally, we derive the classical differential cross section, $d\\sigma/d\\Omega$. The number of particles incident on the annular ring between $b$ and $b+db$ is proportional to the area $d\\sigma = 2\\pi b \\,db$. These particles are scattered into the solid angle element $d\\Omega = 2\\pi \\sin\\Theta \\,d\\Theta$. Conservation of particles requires:\n$$ I_0 d\\sigma = I_0 \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} d\\Omega $$\n$$ 2\\pi b |db| = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} 2\\pi \\sin\\Theta |d\\Theta| $$\nThe absolute values are used because $b$ and $\\Theta$ are inversely related ($db/d\\Theta < 0$).\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{b}{\\sin\\Theta} \\left|\\frac{db}{d\\Theta}\\right| $$\nWe compute the derivative $db/d\\Theta$:\n$$ \\frac{db}{d\\Theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\Theta}\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2E} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{2E} \\left(-\\csc^2\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right)\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{\\kappa}{4E} \\csc^2\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right) $$\nNow we substitute $b(\\Theta)$ and $|db/d\\Theta|$ into the expression for the differential cross section:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\Theta} \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{2E}\\cot\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{4E}\\csc^2\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa^2}{8E^2}\\right) \\frac{\\cot(\\Theta/2) \\csc^2(\\Theta/2)}{\\sin\\Theta} $$\nUsing the trigonometric identities $\\sin\\Theta = 2\\sin(\\Theta/2)\\cos(\\Theta/2)$, $\\cot(\\Theta/2) = \\cos(\\Theta/2)/\\sin(\\Theta/2)$, and $\\csc^2(\\Theta/2) = 1/\\sin^2(\\Theta/2)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa^2}{8E^2}\\right) \\frac{\\frac{\\cos(\\Theta/2)}{\\sin(\\Theta/2)} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(\\Theta/2)}}{2\\sin(\\Theta/2)\\cos(\\Theta/2)} $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa^2}{8E^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{2\\sin^4(\\Theta/2)} = \\frac{\\kappa^2}{16E^2} \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\Theta/2)} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{4E}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\Theta/2)} $$\nThis is the celebrated Rutherford scattering formula.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{4E}\\right)^{2} \\frac{1}{\\sin^{4}\\left(\\frac{\\Theta}{2}\\right)}} $$", "id": "2656988"}]}
