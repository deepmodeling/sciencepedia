It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), is mathematically well-posed, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary information is provided for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution. We will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the substrate elasticity, $\\varepsilon^{v}_{x}$, for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The definition of elasticity is given as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{v}_{x} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln v}{\\partial \\ln x}\n$$\nThis form is most direct for calculation. The rate law for the reaction is:\n$$\nv(x, E) = E V_{\\max} \\frac{x}{K_{M} + x}\n$$\nwhere the parameters $E$, $V_{\\max}$, and $K_{M}$ are treated as constants for the purpose of this partial differentiation. To compute the elasticity, we first take the natural logarithm of the rate expression, $v$:\n$$\n\\ln v = \\ln \\left( E V_{\\max} \\frac{x}{K_{M} + x} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ln v = \\ln(E V_{\\max}) + \\ln(x) - \\ln(K_{M} + x)\n$$\nThe elasticity $\\varepsilon^{v}_{x}$ is the derivative of $\\ln v$ with respect to $\\ln x$.

All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is partitioned into two tasks. We address them sequentially.\n\nPart 1: Computation of Flux Control Coefficients\n\nThe system is an unbranched pathway $A \\xrightarrow{E_{1}, v_{1}} B \\xrightarrow{E_{2}, v_{2}} C$ operating at a steady state where the flux $J = v_{1} = v_{2}$. The core theorems of MCA are to be used.\n\nThe Flux Control Summation Theorem states that the sum of the flux control coefficients for all enzymes in a pathway must equal unity. For this two-enzyme system, this is expressed as:\n$$ C^{J}_{E_{1}} + C^{J}_{E_{2}} = 1 $$\nThis is our first equation. A flux control coefficient $C^{J}_{E_{i}}$ is defined as the fractional change in steady-state flux $J$ resulting from a fractional change in the activity of enzyme $E_{i}$, i.e., $C^{J}_{E_{i}} = \\frac{\\partial J / J}{\\partial e_{i} / e_{i}}$, where $e_i$ is the concentration or activity of enzyme $E_i$.\n\nThe Flux Connectivity Theorem relates the flux control coefficients to the elasticity coefficients for any internal metabolite. For the intermediate metabolite $B$, the theorem is:\n$$ \\sum_{i} C^{J}_{E_{i}} \\varepsilon^{v_{i}}_{B} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon^{v_{i}}_{B}$ is the scaled elasticity of rate $v_{i}$ with respect to the concentration of $B$, defined as $\\varepsilon^{v_{i}}_{B} = \\frac{\\partial v_{i} / v_{i}}{\\partial [B] / [B]}$. For the given pathway, this becomes:\n$$ C^{J}_{E_{1}} \\varepsilon^{v_{1}}_{B} + C^{J}_{E_{2}} \\varepsilon^{v_{2}}_{B} = 0 $$\nThe problem provides the values for the elasticities: $\\varepsilon^{v_{1}}_{B} = 0.8$ and $\\varepsilon^{v_{2}}_{B} = -0.2$. Substituting these values yields our second equation:\n$$ C^{J}_{E_{1}} (0.8) + C^{J}_{E_{2}} (-0.2) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ 0.8 C^{J}_{E_{1}} = 0.2 C^{J}_{E_{2}} $$\n$$ 4 C^{J}_{E_{1}} = C^{J}_{E_{2}} $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $C^{J}_{E_{1}}$ and $C^{J}_{E_{2}}$:\n1.  $C^{J}_{E_{1}} + C^{J}_{E_{2}} = 1$\n2.  $C^{J}_{E_{2}} = 4 C^{J}_{E_{1}}$\n\nSubstitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n$$ C^{J}_{E_{1}} + (4 C^{J}_{E_{1}}) = 1 $$\n$$ 5 C^{J}_{E_{1}} = 1 $$\n$$ C^{J}_{E_{1}} = \\frac{1}{5} $$\nNow, substitute this result back into equation (2) to find $C^{J}_{E_{2}}$:\n$$ C^{J}_{E_{2}} = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) = \\frac{4}{5} $$\nThus, the flux control coefficients are $C^{J}_{E_{1}} = \\frac{1}{5}$ (or $0.2$) and $C^{J}_{E_{2}} = \\frac{4}{5}$ (or $0.8$).\n\nPart 2: Fractional Change in Flux due to a Parameter Perturbation\n\nThe second part requires calculating the fractional change in flux, $\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}$, resulting from a $10\\%$ increase in the Michaelis–Menten constant $K_{M}$ of enzyme $E_{2}$. For a small perturbation, this is a first-order problem.\n\nThe fractional change in a parameter $p$ is related to the fractional change in flux $J$ through the response coefficient, $R^{J}_{p}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J}{J} \\approx R^{J}_{p} \\frac{\\Delta p}{p} $$\nwhere $R^{J}_{p}$ is defined as $\\frac{\\partial J / J}{\\partial p / p}$. In this case, the parameter $p$ is $K_{M}$ of enzyme $E_{2}$, and the perturbation is given as $\\frac{\\Delta K_{M}}{K_{M}} = 10\\% = 0.1 = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nThe Response Coefficient Theorem connects the response coefficient to the control coefficients and parameter elasticities:\n$$ R^{J}_{p} = \\sum_{i} C^{J}_{E_{i}} \\varepsilon^{v_{i}}_{p} $$\nHere, $p = K_{M}$. The parameter $K_{M}$ is specific to enzyme $E_{2}$, meaning it does not directly affect the rate $v_{1}$. Therefore, the parameter elasticity $\\varepsilon^{v_{1}}_{K_{M}} = \\frac{\\partial v_{1} / v_{1}}{\\partial K_{M} / K_{M}} = 0$. The summation simplifies to:\n$$ R^{J}_{K_{M}} = C^{J}_{E_{1}} \\varepsilon^{v_{1}}_{K_{M}} + C^{J}_{E_{2}} \\varepsilon^{v_{2}}_{K_{M}} = C^{J}_{E_{1}}(0) + C^{J}_{E_{2}} \\varepsilon^{v_{2}}_{K_{M}} = C^{J}_{E_{2}} \\varepsilon^{v_{2}}_{K_{M}} $$\nWe are given the elasticity of $v_{2}$ with respect to $K_{M}$ as $\\varepsilon^{v_{2}}_{K_{M}} = -\\frac{K_{M}}{K_{M}+x}$, where $x$ is the steady-state concentration of metabolite $B$. We have also calculated $C^{J}_{E_{2}} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the response coefficient:\n$$ R^{J}_{K_{M}} = \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{K_{M}}{K_{M}+x} \\right) = -\\frac{4K_{M}}{5(K_{M}+x)} $$\nNow, we can compute the leading-order fractional change in flux:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J}{J} \\approx R^{J}_{K_{M}} \\frac{\\Delta K_{M}}{K_{M}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J}{J} = \\left( -\\frac{4K_{M}}{5(K_{M}+x)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{10} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta J}{J} = -\\frac{4K_{M}}{50(K_{M}+x)} = -\\frac{2K_{M}}{25(K_{M}+x)} $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression in terms of $K_{M}$ and $x$.\n\nThe final results to be reported are $C^{J}_{E_{1}}$, $C^{J}_{E_{2}}$, and $\\frac{\\Delta J}{J}$.\n$C^{J}_{E_{1}} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n$C^{J}_{E_{2}} = \\frac{4}{5}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta J}{J} = -\\frac{2K_{M}}{25(K_{M}+x)}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5} & \\frac{4}{5} & -\\frac{2K_{M}}{25(K_{M}+x)} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2655116"}, {"introduction": "This advanced exercise bridges the quantitative MCA framework with the classical concept of a 'rate-limiting step'.
