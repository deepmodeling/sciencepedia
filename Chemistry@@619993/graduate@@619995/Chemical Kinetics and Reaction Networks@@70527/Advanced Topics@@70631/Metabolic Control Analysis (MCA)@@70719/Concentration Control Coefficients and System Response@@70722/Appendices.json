It describes a standard linear reaction chain, a fundamental model in chemical kinetics and systems biology. The theory of Metabolic Control Analysis, which defines and utilizes concentration control coefficients, is a well-established discipline. The problem is **well-posed**, as it provides all necessary information—the network structure, kinetic laws, a constant input, and the definition of the quantities to be calculated. The assumption of a stable steady state with positive concentrations is guaranteed by the constant positive inflow $u$ and positive rate constants $k_i$. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises. The problem is a standard, formalizable exercise in applying the principles of chemical kinetics and control analysis.\n\nThe validation verdict is that the problem is **valid**. A solution may proceed.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentrations of species $A$, $B$, and $C$, denoted by the same symbols, are described by the following system of ordinary differential equations based on mass-action kinetics:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = u - v_1 = u - k_1 A\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = v_1 - v_2 = k_1 A - k_2 B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = v_2 - v_3 = k_2 B - k_3 C\n$$\nAt steady state, the time derivatives of all concentrations are zero. Let the steady-state concentrations be denoted by $A^{\\ast}$, $B^{\\ast}$, and $C^{\\ast}$. The system of algebraic equations for the steady state is:\n$$\n0 = u - k_1 A^{\\ast} \\implies k_1 A^{\\ast} = u\n$$\n$$\n0 = k_1 A^{\\ast} - k_2 B^{\\ast} \\implies k_2 B^{\\ast} = k_1 A^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n0 = k_2 B^{\\ast} - k_3 C^{\\ast} \\implies k_3 C^{\\ast} = k_2 B^{\\ast}\n$$\nSolving this system sequentially yields the steady-state concentrations in terms of the parameters $u$, $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$:\n$$\nA^{\\ast} = \\frac{u}{k_1}\n$$\n$$\nB^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2} A^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2} \\left(\\frac{u}{k_1}\\right) = \\frac{u}{k_2}\n$$\n$$\nC^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_2}{k_3} B^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_2}{k_3} \\left(\\frac{u}{k_2}\\right) = \\frac{u}{k_3}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the physical intuition that at steady state in an unbranched pathway, the flux through each reaction step must be equal to the input flux, i.e., $v_1^{\\ast} = v_2^{\\ast} = v_3^{\\ast} = u$.\n\nNext, we introduce the activity parameters $e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$. The perturbed rate laws are $v_1' = e_1 k_1 A$, $v_2' = e_2 k_2 B$, and $v_3' = e_3 k_3 C$. The steady-state equations for the perturbed system, with concentrations now being functions of these parameters, are:\n$$\nu - e_1 k_1 A^{\\ast}(e_1, e_2, e_3) = 0\n$$\n$$\ne_1 k_1 A^{\\ast}(e_1, e_2, e_3) - e_2 k_2 B^{\\ast}(e_1, e_2, e_3) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration of $B$ as a function of the activity parameters:\nFrom the first equation, $A^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{u}{e_1 k_1}$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$$\ne_1 k_1 \\left(\\frac{u}{e_1 k_1}\\right) - e_2 k_2 B^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nu - e_2 k_2 B^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nB^{\\ast}(e_1, e_2, e_3) = \\frac{u}{e_2 k_2}\n$$\nWe observe that the steady-state concentration of $B$ depends only on the parameter $e_2$, and is independent of $e_1$ and $e_3$.\n\nThe concentration control coefficient is defined as $C_{B}^{v_j} = \\left.\\dfrac{\\partial \\ln B^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\ln e_j}\\right|_{e_k=1 \\ \\forall k}$.\nTo compute this, we first find the natural logarithm of $B^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\ln B^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{u}{e_2 k_2}\\right) = \\ln(u) - \\ln(e_2) - \\ln(k_2)\n$$\nNow we compute the partial derivative of $\\ln B^{\\ast}$ with respect to $\\ln e_j$ for $j=1, 2, 3$. The chain rule for logarithmic derivatives states that $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\ln x} = x \\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$.

The steady-state concentration of $B$ is determined by the balance of its production flux ($v_1$) and its consumption flux ($v_2$). In this linear system, the steady-state flux through the entire pathway is clamped by the constant inflow $u$. Therefore, $v_2^{\\ast} = u$, which implies $k_2 B^{\\ast} = u$, so $B^{\\ast} = u/k_2$. This concentration is independent of reaction $v_1$ (which only sets the concentration of $A$) and reaction $v_3$ (which is downstream and has no influence on $B$). The concentration $B^{\\ast}$ is inversely proportional to its own removal rate constant $k_2$, which leads to a control coefficient of $-1$ with respect to its own reaction rate $v_2$.\n\nThe three concentration control coefficients are $(C_{B}^{v_1}, C_{B}^{v_2}, C_{B}^{v_3}) = (0, -1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2634777"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating individual control coefficients, a key insight from Metabolic Control Analysis is that these coefficients are not independent but are constrained by the system's fundamental properties.

We will now proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe system is defined by two fundamental laws at steady state:\n$1$. The mass-balance law, which dictates that at steady state the net rate of production of each species is zero. This is given by $\\dot{x} = N v(x,\\alpha) = 0$, where $x = \\begin{pmatrix} S \\\\ S^{\\ast} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of species concentrations, $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of reaction rates, and $N$ is the stoichiometric matrix.

The moiety conservation law, given by $\\Gamma x = c$, which states that the total concentration of the moiety, $S_{\\mathrm{T}} = S + S^{\\ast}$, is constant. A critical piece of information is that $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is independent of the enzyme activities $E_1$ and $E_2$.\n\nThe steady-state concentrations of $S$ and $S^{\\ast}$ are functions of the system parameters, which include the enzyme activities $E_1$ and $E_2$. We denote these parameters generically by $\\alpha_i$, where $\\alpha_1=E_1$ and $\\alpha_2=E_2$.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Linear Constraint and Physical Interpretation**\n\nWe begin with the conservation law, which must hold true for any set of parameters:\n$$\nS(\\alpha_i) + S^{\\ast}(\\alpha_i) = S_{\\mathrm{T}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is a constant independent of $\\alpha_i$. Therefore, when we differentiate this relation with respect to a parameter $\\alpha_i$, the derivative of the right-hand side is zero. Let us choose a generic parameter $\\alpha_i \\in \\{E_1, E_2\\}$ and perform the differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha_i} \\left( S(\\alpha_i) + S^{\\ast}(\\alpha_i) \\right) = \\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\partial \\alpha_i}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\alpha_i} + \\frac{\\partial S^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\alpha_i} = 0\n$$\nThis equation relates the unscaled sensitivities of the species concentrations to the parameter $\\alpha_i$. The problem requires a constraint on the dimensionless concentration control coefficients, defined as $C_{S_{j}}^{v_{i}} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln S_{j}}{\\partial \\ln \\alpha_{i}}$. We use the chain rule to express the derivatives in terms of these coefficients. For a species $S_j$, the definition implies:\n$$\nC_{S_{j}}^{v_{i}} = \\frac{\\alpha_i}{S_j} \\frac{\\partial S_j}{\\partial \\alpha_i}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the unscaled sensitivity in terms of the scaled coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_j}{\\partial \\alpha_i} = \\frac{S_j}{\\alpha_i} C_{S_{j}}^{v_{i}}\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for both $S$ and $S^{\\ast}$ into the differentiated conservation law:\n$$\n\\frac{S}{\\alpha_i} C_{S}^{v_i} + \\frac{S^{\\ast}}{\\alpha_i} C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_i} = 0\n$$\nSince the enzyme activities $\\alpha_i$ are strictly positive, we can multiply the entire equation by $\\alpha_i$ to obtain the final linear constraint:\n$$\nS \\cdot C_{S}^{v_i} + S^{\\ast} \\cdot C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_i} = 0\n$$\nThis constraint, a specific instance of a summation theorem in MCA, holds for any parameter $\\alpha_i$ that does not alter the total moiety concentration $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$. In this problem, this applies to both $i=1$ (for $\\alpha_1=E_1$) and $i=2$ (for $\\alpha_2=E_2$).\n\nThe physical reason for this constraint is a direct consequence of the conservation of matter. The total amount $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is fixed. If a perturbation in a parameter (e.g., an increase in $E_1$) causes an increase in the concentration of one form of the moiety (e.g., $S^{\\ast}$), it must be accompanied by a precisely balanced decrease in the concentration of the other form ($S$) to keep their sum constant. The control coefficients are logarithmic sensitivities, and the relationship $S \\cdot C_{S}^{v_i} = -S^{\\ast} \\cdot C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_i}$ quantifies this mandatory redistribution. Since concentrations $S$ and $S^{\\ast}$ are positive, the control coefficients $C_{S}^{v_i}$ and $C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_i}$ must have opposite signs (or both be zero), reflecting this opposing response.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Row Matrix R**\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit computation of the row matrix $R$ whose entries are defined as:\n$$\nR_{i} \\equiv S\\,C_{S}^{v_{i}} + S^{\\ast}\\,C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_{i}}\n$$\nfor $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, evaluated at steady state.\n\nIn Task 1, we rigorously derived the linear constraint $S \\cdot C_{S}^{v_i} + S^{\\ast} \\cdot C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_i} = 0$ for any parameter $\\alpha_i$ ($i=1,2$) that leaves $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$ invariant. The expression defining each entry $R_i$ of the matrix $R$ is identical to the left-hand side of this derived constraint.\n\nTherefore, for $i=1$, corresponding to the parameter $\\alpha_1 = E_1$:\n$$\nR_{1} = S\\,C_{S}^{v_{1}} + S^{\\ast}\\,C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_{1}} = 0\n$$\nAnd for $i=2$, corresponding to the parameter $\\alpha_2 = E_2$:\n$$\nR_{2} = S\\,C_{S}^{v_{2}} + S^{\\ast}\\,C_{S^{\\ast}}^{v_{2}} = 0\n$$\nThe row matrix $R$ is thus a $1 \\times 2$ matrix with both entries equal to zero.\n$$\nR = \\begin{pmatrix} R_1 & R_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis result follows directly and without need for explicit calculation of the individual control coefficients, demonstrating the utility of the general theorems of MCA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2634831"}, {"introduction": "The distribution of control in a network is deeply connected to its underlying structure.

This identity demonstrates that the equations are consistent.\n\nThe right nullspace of $N$ is the set of all vectors $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5)^T$ satisfying these conditions.

Reactions $v_3$ and $v_4$ are not structurally blocked.\n-   $v_5 = 0$: This component is always zero for any vector in the nullspace. Therefore, reaction $v_5$ is structurally blocked.\n\nThus, exactly one reaction, $v_5$, is structurally blocked.\n\nNext, we must determine the implications for the concentration control coefficients, $C^{x_i}_{e_j} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\ln x_i^\\ast}{\\partial \\ln e_j}$.

The rank of $N$ is $3$, which is less than the number of species ($4$), implying the existence of $4-3=1$ conservation law. The vector $c=(1,1,1,1)^T$ is a basis for the left nullspace of $N$ ($c^T N = 0$), corresponding to the conservation law $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = M$ for some constant total concentration $M$.\n\nThe independent steady-state equations for the network are:\n1.  $-v_1 + v_2 = 0 \\implies -e_1 \\phi_1(x^*) + e_2 \\phi_2(x^*) = 0$\n2.  $v_3 - v_4 = 0 \\implies e_3 \\phi_3(x^*) - e_4 \\phi_4(x^*) = 0$\n3.  $v_5 = 0 \\implies e_5 \\phi_5(x^*) = 0 \\implies \\phi_5(x^*) = 0$\n4.  $x_1^*+x_2^*+x_3^*+x_4^* = M$\n\nThe steady-state concentration vector $x^*$ is the solution to this system of four equations. Critically, the parameter $e_5$ does not appear in this system of equations. The solution $x^*$ is a function of $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$, and $M$, but it is not a function of $e_5$.\nConsequently, the partial derivative of any steady-state concentration $x_i^*$ with respect to the parameter $e_5$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_i^*}{\\partial e_5} = 0\n$$\nThe definition of the concentration control coefficient is $C^{x_i}_{e_5} = \\dfrac{e_5}{x_i^*} \\dfrac{\\partial x_i^*}{\\partial e_5}$.

Therefore, $x^*$ will in general depend on these parameters, and their corresponding control coefficients $C^{x_i}_{e_j}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ can be non-zero.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\nA) Exactly reaction $v_5$ is structurally blocked (i.e., $v_5=0$ in all steady-state flux vectors), and it follows that $C^{x_i}_{e_5}=0$ for all species $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, whereas reactions $v_1$–$v_4$ can carry nonzero steady-state flux and may have nonzero concentration control.\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. We found that only $v_5$ is structurally blocked, which implies all $C^{x_i}_{e_5}$ must be zero. We also found that $v_1$ through $v_4$ are not blocked and their control coefficients are generally non-zero.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB) Reaction $v_3$ is structurally blocked because $X_2$ and $X_3$ cannot both be balanced at steady state unless $v_3=0$, hence $C^{x_i}_{e_3}=0$ for all $i$.\nOur analysis shows that $v_3$ is not structurally blocked. The reasoning provided is flawed; the balance equations are satisfied when $v_1=v_2$ and $v_3=v_4$, which does not require $v_3=0$. The conclusion is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC) No reactions are structurally blocked; therefore all concentration control coefficients $C^{x_i}_{e_j}$ are generally nonzero.\nThis contradicts our finding that $v_5$ is structurally blocked and its associated concentration control coefficients are identically zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD) Reactions $v_1$ and $v_2$ are structurally blocked due to mutual cancellation in the $X_1$ and $X_2$ balances, hence $C^{x_i}_{e_1}=C^{x_i}_{e_2}=0$ for all $i$.\nOur analysis shows that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are not structurally blocked. The condition $v_1=v_2$ indicates perfect coupling, not that they are blocked (i.e., not that they must be zero). The conclusion regarding the control coefficients is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE) Reaction $v_5$ is structurally blocked, but $C^{x_3}_{e_5}$ can be nonzero because $v_5$ appears in the $X_3$ balance equation.\nThe first part of the statement is correct: $v_5$ is structurally blocked. However, the second part is incorrect. As derived, a structural block implies that the steady state is independent of the corresponding enzyme activity parameter $e_5$, leading to zero control coefficients. The appearance of $v_5$ in the dynamic balance equation for $X_3$ does not mean the steady-state concentration of $X_3$ depends on $e_5$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2634774"}]}
