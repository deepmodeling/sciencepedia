The given network has a set of $n=3$ species $\\{A, B, C\\}$, a set of $m=4$ complexes $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\}$, and $r=5$ reactions. We will proceed by constructing each matrix according to its provided definition. Let us index the species as $1 \\to A$, $2 \\to B$, and $3 \\to C$.\n\nFirst, we construct the species–complex matrix $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 4}$. The entry $Y_{i\\alpha}$ represents the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in complex $\\alpha$. The complexes are given as $C_1 = A+B$, $C_2 = 2A$, $C_3 = B+C$, and $C_4 = 3C$. The columns of $Y$ are the vector representations of these complexes in the species basis $(A, B, C)$.\nFor $C_1 = 1A + 1B + 0C$, the first column is $(1, 1, 0)^T$.\nFor $C_2 = 2A + 0B + 0C$, the second column is $(2, 0, 0)^T$.\nFor $C_3 = 0A + 1B + 1C$, the third column is $(0, 1, 1)^T$.\nFor $C_4 = 0A + 0B + 3C$, the fourth column is $(0, 0, 3)^T$.\nAssembling these columns gives the matrix $Y$:\n$$ Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nSecond, we construct the incidence matrix $I \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 5}$ of the reaction graph. The rows correspond to the complexes $C_1$ through $C_4$, and the columns correspond to the five reactions. For each reaction $j$, the corresponding column of $I$ has a $-1$ at the row of the source complex and a $+1$ at the row of the target complex.\nReaction 1: $C_1 \\to C_2$. Source $C_1$, Target $C_2$. Column 1 is $(-1, 1, 0, 0)^T$.\nReaction 2: $C_2 \\to C_3$. Source $C_2$, Target $C_3$. Column 2 is $(0, -1, 1, 0)^T$.\nReaction 3: $C_3 \\to C_4$.

The $j$-th column of $N$ is the net change in species for reaction $j$, calculated as the composition vector of the product complex minus the composition vector of the reactant complex. These composition vectors are precisely the columns of the matrix $Y$.\nReaction 1: $C_1 \\to C_2$ ($A+B \\to 2A$). Net change: $C_2 - C_1 = (2,0,0)^T - (1,1,0)^T = (1,-1,0)^T$.\nReaction 2: $C_2 \\to C_3$ ($2A \\to B+C$). Net change: $C_3 - C_2 = (0,1,1)^T - (2,0,0)^T = (-2,1,1)^T$.\nReaction 3: $C_3 \\to C_4$ ($B+C \\to 3C$). Net change: $C_4 - C_3 = (0,0,3)^T - (0,1,1)^T = (0,-1,2)^T$.\nReaction 4: $C_4 \\to C_1$ ($3C \\to A+B$).

Net change: $C_3 - C_1 = (0,1,1)^T - (1,1,0)^T = (-1,0,1)^T$.\nAssembling these columns gives the matrix $N$:\n$$ N = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & -3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe problem is to compute $\\|N - YI\\|_{F}$. In CRNT, the relationship $N = YI$ is a fundamental identity that connects the net change in species (the stoichiometric matrix $N$) to the mapping from complexes to reactions (the incidence matrix $I$) and the mapping from species to complexes (the species-complex matrix $Y$). This problem amounts to a verification of this identity. We compute the product $YI$:\n$$ YI = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication yields:\n$$ YI = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & -3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUpon inspection, the computed matrix $YI$ is identical to the matrix $N$ we constructed previously.

For the zero matrix, all entries are $0$, so the sum of the squares of its entries is $0$.\n$$ \\|N - YI\\|_{F} = \\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\|_{F} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2} = 0 $$\nThe result is exactly $0$, which confirms the validity of the identity $N=YI$ for this specific reaction network.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2636215"}, {"introduction": "Once a network is described by its matrices, we can compute topological invariants that reveal profound insights into its potential dynamic behavior.

A chemical reaction network is weakly reversible if for every reaction $C_i \\to C_j$, there exists a directed path of reactions from $C_j$ back to $C_i$.

From the reaction list, we identify the following $8$ unique complexes:\n$C_1 = X + Y$\n$C_2 = 2X$\n$C_3 = X + Z$\n$C_4 = 2Z$\n$C_5 = Y + Z$\n$C_6 = 2Y$\n$C_7 = X$\n$C_8 = Z$\n\nThe reactions define the directed edges of the graph:\n$C_1 \\to C_2$\n$C_2 \\to C_3$\n$C_3 \\to C_1$\n$C_3 \\to C_4$\n$C_4 \\to C_5$\n$C_5 \\to C_4$\n$C_6 \\to C_7$\n$C_7 \\to C_6$\n$C_7 \\to C_8$\n\nWith the graph structure established, we proceed to compute the required quantities.\n\n1.  **Linkage Classes ($L$)**\n    A linkage class is a connected component of the underlying undirected graph. To find these, we ignore the direction of the edges and identify the connected subgraphs.\n    The edges, treated as undirected connections, are:\n    $(C_1, C_2)$, $(C_2, C_3)$, $(C_3, C_4)$, $(C_4, C_5)$, $(C_6, C_7)$, $(C_7, C_8)$.\n    We can trace the connectivity:\n    - Starting from $C_1$, we can reach $C_2$, then $C_3$, then $C_4$, and finally $C_5$. This forms one connected component: $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5\\}$.\n    - The remaining vertices are $C_6, C_7, C_8$. $C_6$ is connected to $C_7$, which is connected to $C_8$. This forms a second connected component: $\\{C_6, C_7, C_8\\}$.\n    There are two distinct linkage classes. Therefore, the number of linkage classes is $L=2$.\n\n2.  **Strong Linkage Classes ($S$)**\n    A strong linkage class is a strongly connected component (SCC) of the directed graph. An SCC is a maximal subgraph where for any two vertices $u, v$ in the subgraph, there exists a directed path from $u$ to $v$ and a directed path from $v$ to $u$. We identify these by finding cycles and maximal sets of mutually reachable vertices.\n    - The reactions $C_1 \\to C_2$, $C_2 \\to C_3$, and $C_3 \\to C_1$ form a directed cycle. Thus, the set of complexes $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3\\}$ is strongly connected. Since there is an edge $C_3 \\to C_4$ but no path from $C_4$ back to $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3\\}$, this set is maximal. It is the first SCC: $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3\\}$.\n    - The reactions $C_4 \\to C_5$ and $C_5 \\to C_4$ form a directed $2$-cycle. The set $\\{C_4, C_5\\}$ is strongly connected. It is maximal as there are no outgoing edges from it to any other SCC. It is the second SCC: $\\{C_4, C_5\\}$.\n    - The reactions $C_6 \\to C_7$ and $C_7 \\to C_6$ form another directed $2$-cycle. The set $\\{C_6, C_7\\}$ is strongly connected. It is maximal because there is an edge $C_7 \\to C_8$ but no path from $C_8$ back to this set. It is the third SCC: $\\{C_6, C_7\\}$.\n    - The complex $C_8$ has an incoming edge from $C_7$ but no outgoing edges. A single vertex with no path to any other vertex constitutes a trivial SCC. It is maximal by definition. It is the fourth SCC: $\\{C_8\\}$.\n    There are a total of four strong linkage classes. Therefore, the number of strong linkage classes is $S=4$.\n\n3.  **Terminal Strong Linkage Classes ($T$)**\n    A terminal strong linkage class is an SCC that has no directed edges originating from one of its vertices and terminating at a vertex outside the SCC. We examine each SCC:\n    - SCC $1$: $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3\\}$. The edge $C_3 \\to C_4$ leaves this SCC, as $C_4$ is not in SCC $1$. Thus, this SCC is not terminal.\n    - SCC $2$: $\\{C_4, C_5\\}$. The only edges from these vertices are $C_4 \\to C_5$ and $C_5 \\to C_4$, both of which are internal to the SCC. There are no outgoing edges. Thus, this SCC is terminal.\n    - SCC $3$: $\\{C_6, C_7\\}$. The edge $C_7 \\to C_8$ leaves this SCC, as $C_8$ is not in SCC $3$. Thus, this SCC is not terminal.\n    - SCC $4$: $\\{C_8\\}$. The vertex $C_8$ has no outgoing edges at all, so it certainly has no edges leading outside the SCC. Thus, this SCC is terminal.\n    There are two terminal strong linkage classes. Therefore, a number of terminal strong linkage classes is $T=2$.\n\n4.  **Computation of $Q$**\n    We are asked to compute the scalar $Q = L + 2S + 3T$. Substituting the values we have found:\n    $L = 2$\n    $S = 4$\n    $T = 2$\n    The calculation is as follows:\n    $$Q = 2 + 2(4) + 3(2) = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16$$\nThe value of $Q$ is $16$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "2636221"}]}
