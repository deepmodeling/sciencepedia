It presents a standard, solvable problem in the field of stochastic chemical kinetics, comparing an exact stochastic description with a deterministic approximation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Exact Steady-State Mean and Variance\n\nWe are given the master-equation identity for the time evolution of the expectation of an arbitrary test function $f(n_A)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle f(n_A)\\rangle \\;=\\; \\left\\langle \\alpha\\big(f(n_A+1)-f(n_A)\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta n_A\\big(f(n_A-1)-f(n_A)\\big) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nAt steady state, the time derivative of any expectation value is zero. Thus, for any function $f$, we have:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\alpha\\big(f(n_A+1)-f(n_A)\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta n_A\\big(f(n_A-1)-f(n_A)\\big) \\right\\rangle = 0\n$$\n\nTo find the steady-state mean $\\langle n_A \\rangle$, we choose the test function $f(n_A) = n_A$. The corresponding differences are $f(n_A+1)-f(n_A) = (n_A+1)-n_A = 1$ and $f(n_A-1)-f(n_A) = (n_A-1)-n_A = -1$. Substituting these into the steady-state identity gives:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\alpha(1) + \\beta n_A(-1) \\right\\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\alpha - \\beta n_A \\rangle = 0\n$$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, this becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha - \\beta \\langle n_A \\rangle = 0\n$$\nSolving for the mean, we find:\n$$\n\\langle n_A \\rangle = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\n\nTo find the steady-state variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(n_A) = \\langle n_A^2 \\rangle - \\langle n_A \\rangle^2$, we must first compute the second moment $\\langle n_A^2 \\rangle$. We choose the test function $f(n_A) = n_A^2$. The differences are $f(n_A+1)-f(n_A) = (n_A+1)^2-n_A^2 = 2n_A+1$ and $f(n_A-1)-f(n_A) = (n_A-1)^2-n_A^2 = -2n_A+1$. Substituting these into the steady-state identity:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\alpha(2n_A+1) + \\beta n_A(-2n_A+1) \\right\\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle 2\\alpha n_A + \\alpha - 2\\beta n_A^2 + \\beta n_A \\rangle = 0\n$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n(2\\alpha+\\beta)\\langle n_A \\rangle + \\alpha - 2\\beta \\langle n_A^2 \\rangle = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $\\langle n_A^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\n2\\beta \\langle n_A^2 \\rangle = (2\\alpha+\\beta)\\langle n_A \\rangle + \\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting the previously found steady-state mean $\\langle n_A \\rangle = \\alpha/\\beta$:\n$$\n2\\beta \\langle n_A^2 \\rangle = (2\\alpha+\\beta)\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) + \\alpha = \\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\beta} + \\alpha + \\alpha = \\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\beta} + 2\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\langle n_A^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\beta} + 2\\alpha\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\nNow we compute the variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(n_A) = \\langle n_A^2 \\rangle - \\langle n_A \\rangle^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\nThus, the exact steady-state mean and variance are both equal to $\\alpha/\\beta$. This is consistent with the known result that the steady-state distribution is a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = \\alpha/\\beta$.\n\nPart 2: Mean-Field Variance\n\nThe problem defines the \"lowest-order mean-field (deterministic) closure\" by a set of explicit rules: a) neglecting fluctuations, b) the only dynamical variable is the mean $m(t) = \\langle n_A(t) \\rangle$ evolving via $dm/dt = \\alpha - \\beta m$, and c) higher central moments are taken to be zero.\nThese conditions describe a deterministic model. In a deterministic framework, the concept of randomness is absent. The state of the system at any time is a single, well-defined value, not a probability distribution. The quantity $n_A$ is no longer a random variable but is identically equal to its mean value, $n_A(t) \\equiv m(t)$.\nThe variance of a quantity measures its spread or fluctuation around the mean. For a deterministic quantity, there are no fluctuations. The variance of a constant or a deterministically evolving variable is, by definition, zero. The condition that \"higher central moments are taken to be zero\" includes the second central moment, which is the variance. Therefore, the variance predicted by this closure is zero.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\mathrm{mf}}(n_A) = 0\n$$\n\nPart 3: Relative Error and its Supremum\n\nThe relative error $\\varepsilon$ of the mean-field closure for the steady-state variance is defined as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{\\left|\\operatorname{Var}_{\\mathrm{mf}}(n_A)-\\operatorname{Var}(n_A)\\right|}{\\operatorname{Var}(n_A)}\n$$\nSubstituting the results from Part 1 and Part 2:\n- Exact variance: $\\operatorname{Var}(n_A) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$\n- Mean-field variance: $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\mathrm{mf}}(n_A) = 0$\n\nThe expression for the error becomes:\n$$\n\\varepsilon\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{\\left|0 - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right|}{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}\n$$\nGiven that $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$, the term $\\alpha/\\beta$ is strictly positive. The denominator is non-zero for the specified range $\\alpha/\\beta \\in [1, 10]$.\nTherefore, the error simplifies to:\n$$\n\\varepsilon\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}}{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} = 1\n$$\nThe relative error is a constant function with a value of $1$. This signifies a complete failure of the deterministic model to capture the system's fluctuations.\n\nThe final task is to find the supremum of this error function over the interval $\\alpha/\\beta \\in [1, 10]$. The supremum of a constant function over any interval is simply the constant value itself.\n$$\n\\sup_{\\alpha/\\beta \\in [1, 10]} \\varepsilon\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\sup_{\\alpha/\\beta \\in [1, 10]} (1) = 1\n$$\nThe worst-case relative error is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2629136"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple linear systems, the consequences of stochasticity become more profound.

Transitions between states occur due to diffusion, while absorption occurs due to reaction. The propensities (rates) for these events are given:\n- Diffusion of $A$ from voxel $1$ to $2$: $x \\to x-1$, rate $a_{x-1,y}(x,y) = D\\,x$.\n- Diffusion of $A$ from voxel $2$ to $1$: $x \\to x+1$, rate $a_{x+1,y}(x,y) = D\\,(5-x)$.\n- Diffusion of $B$ from voxel $1$ to $2$: $y \\to y-1$, rate $a_{x,y-1}(x,y) = D\\,y$.\n- Diffusion of $B$ from voxel $2$ to $1$: $y \\to y+1$, rate $a_{x,y+1}(x,y) = D\\,(5-y)$.\n\nThe process terminates (is absorbed) upon the first reaction event. The total reaction rate in state $(x,y)$ is the sum of reaction rates in both voxels:\n$$ r(x,y) = k\\,x\\,y + k\\,(5-x)(5-y) $$\nThis rate $r(x,y)$ is the rate of absorption from state $(x,y)$.\n\nLet $T(x,y)$ be the expected time to the first reaction (absorption), given the system is initially in state $(x,y)$. We can derive a set of linear equations for $T(x,y)$ using the backward Kolmogorov equations for the MFPT. For any transient state $i$, the expected time $T_i$ satisfies the relation:\n$$ -1 = \\sum_{j} Q_{ij} T_j $$\nwhere $Q$ is the generator matrix of the process. In our context, the states are $(x,y)$ and $Q$ is the generator of the transient process. The elements of $Q$ are:\n$Q_{(x,y) \\to (x',y')}$ is the rate of transition from $(x,y)$ to a different state $(x',y')$. These are the diffusion propensities.\n$Q_{(x,y) \\to (x,y)}$ is the negative of the total rate of leaving state $(x,y)$, which includes both diffusion and reaction.\nThe total rate of leaving state $(x,y)$ is $\\lambda(x,y)$:\n$$ \\lambda(x,y) = \\left( \\sum_{(x',y') \\neq (x,y)} a_{(x',y')}(x,y) \\right) + r(x,y) $$\n$$ \\lambda(x,y) = D\\,x + D\\,(5-x) + D\\,y + D\\,(5-y) + k[xy + (5-x)(5-y)] $$\n$$ \\lambda(x,y) = 10D + k[xy + (5-x)(5-y)] $$\nThe diagonal elements of the generator are $Q_{(x,y)\\to(x,y)} = -\\lambda(x,y)$.\n\nThe backward equation for $T(x,y)$ is therefore:\n$$ -1 = -\\lambda(x,y) T(x,y) + D\\,x\\,T(x-1,y) + D\\,(5-x)\\,T(x+1,y) + D\\,y\\,T(x,y-1) + D\\,(5-y)T(x,y+1) $$\nHere, we take $T(\\cdot,\\cdot)=0$ if a state is outside the defined state space boundaries (e.g., $x<0$ or $x>5$).\nRearranging this equation, we obtain a linear system:\n$$ \\lambda(x,y) T(x,y) - D\\,x\\,T(x-1,y) - D\\,(5-x)\\,T(x+1,y) - D\\,y\\,T(x,y-1) - D\\,(5-y)T(x,y+1) = 1 $$\nThis system must hold for every state $(x,y)$ in our $36$-state space. This can be expressed in matrix form as $A \\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\mathbf{T}$ is a column vector of the $36$ unknown values $T(x,y)$, $\\mathbf{1}$ is a column vector of ones, and $A$ is a $36 \\times 36$ matrix of coefficients.\nIf we order the states $(x,y)$ using a single index $i = 6x+y$, the matrix $A$ has elements:\n- Diagonal elements: $A_{i,i} = \\lambda(x,y) = 10D + k[xy + (5-x)(5-y)]$.\n- Off-diagonal elements for $i = 6x+y$:\n  - $A_{i, 6(x-1)+y} = -D\\,x$ for $x > 0$.\n  - $A_{i, 6(x+1)+y} = -D\\,(5-x)$ for $x < 5$.\n  - $A_{i, 6x+(y-1)} = -D\\,y$ for $y > 0$.\n  - $A_{i, 6x+(y+1)} = -D\\,(5-y)$ for $y < 5$.\n  - All other off-diagonal elements are $0$.\n\nWe must solve this linear system for the given values of $D$ and $k=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The initial state is $(x,y)=(5,0)$, which corresponds to index $i = 6 \\cdot 5 + 0 = 30$. We need to find $T(5,0)$.\n\nConsider the special case $D=0.0\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nWhen $D=0$, there is no diffusion. The states are decoupled. The matrix $A$ becomes diagonal with elements $A_{i,i} = \\lambda(x,y) = r(x,y) = k[xy + (5-x)(5-y)]$.\nThe system of equations reduces to $r(x,y) T(x,y) = 1$ for each state.\nThe initial state is $(5,0)$. The reaction rate in this state is $r(5,0) = k[5 \\cdot 0 + (5-5)(5-0)] = 0$.\nThe equation for $T(5,0)$ is $0 \\cdot T(5,0) = 1$, which is impossible. Physically, if the system starts in a state with zero reaction rate and there is no mechanism (diffusion) to move to a different state, the reaction will never occur. The expected time to the reaction is infinite. Thus, for $D=0$, $T(5,0) = \\infty$. The matrix $A$ is singular in this case, which is consistent.\n\nFor $D > 0$, diffusion connects all states. Since there exist states with non-zero reaction rates (e.g., $(1,1)$ where $r(1,1)=k(1+16)=1.7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} > 0$), any initial state can eventually reach an absorbing (reacting) state. Therefore, the MFPT is finite for any $D>0$, and the matrix $A$ will be non-singular.\n\nWe can also consider the limit $D \\to \\infty$. In this limit, diffusion is much faster than reaction, leading to a well-mixed system. The molecules of each species are distributed binomially between the two voxels. The probability of a molecule being in voxel $1$ is $p=1/2$. The number of $A$ molecules, $x$, follows $\\mathrm{Binomial}(5, 1/2)$, and similarly for $y$. The average number of molecules is $\\langle x \\rangle = 5 \\cdot 1/2 = 2.5$ and $\\langle y \\rangle = 5 \\cdot 1/2 = 2.5$.\nThe average reaction rate is $\\langle r \\rangle = k[\\langle x \\rangle \\langle y \\rangle + \\langle 5-x \\rangle \\langle 5-y \\rangle] = k[2.5^2 + 2.5^2] = 12.5k$.\nWith $k=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\langle r \\rangle = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The expected time to reaction in this well-mixed limit is approximately $1/\\langle r \\rangle = 1/1.25 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$. We expect the result for $D=50.0$ to approach this value, as $D \\gg k$.\n\nTo find the exact values, we construct the $36 \\times 36$ matrix $A$ for each given $D>0$, form the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ of all ones, and solve the linear system $A \\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the vector of expected times $\\mathbf{T}$. The answer for each case is the element of $\\mathbf{T}$ corresponding to the initial state $(5,0)$.", "answer": "```\n[inf,200.800008,4.800080,0.880008,0.816000]\n```", "id": "2629166"}]}
