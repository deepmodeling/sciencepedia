The mean is $\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{r p_{\\text{succ}}}{1-p_{\\text{succ}}}$ and the variance is $\\text{Var}(N) = \\frac{r p_{\\text{succ}}}{(1-p_{\\text{succ}})^2}$.\nSubstituting our parameters:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle_{exact} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}) (\\frac{\\beta}{\\delta})}{1 - \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}}{\\frac{\\delta-\\beta}{\\delta}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta-\\beta}\n$$\nThe exact stationary variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{exact} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}) (\\frac{\\beta}{\\delta})}{(1 - \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta})^2} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta}}{(\\frac{\\delta-\\beta}{\\delta})^2} = \\frac{\\alpha\\delta}{(\\delta-\\beta)^2}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the LNA-Predicted Stationary Variance**\n\nThe Linear Noise Approximation is derived from a system-size expansion of the CME. It approximates the stochastic system with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process governing fluctuations around a deterministic trajectory.\n\nFirst, we establish the deterministic rate equation for the number of molecules $N$ by treating it as a continuous variable:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\sum_{j} \\nu_j a_j(N) = (1)a_1(N) + (1)a_2(N) + (-1)a_3(N) = \\alpha + \\beta N - \\delta N = \\alpha + (\\beta - \\delta)N\n$$\nThe deterministic stationary state $N_{ss}$ is found by setting $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n\\alpha + (\\beta - \\delta)N_{ss} = 0 \\implies N_{ss} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta - \\beta}\n$$\nThis correctly reproduces the exact mean.\n\nThe LNA provides a formula for the stationary variance based on the properties of the system at this deterministic steady state. The variance is given by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{LNA} = \\frac{\\sum_{j} \\nu_j^2 a_j(N_{ss})}{-2 \\frac{d}{dN}\\left(\\sum_{j} \\nu_j a_j(N)\\right)\\Big|_{N=N_{ss}}}\n$$\nThe numerator is the effective diffusion coefficient, evaluated at steady state:\n$$\nB(N_{ss}) = \\sum_{j} \\nu_j^2 a_j(N_{ss}) = (1)^2 a_1(N_{ss}) + (1)^2 a_2(N_{ss}) + (-1)^2 a_3(N_{ss})\n$$\n$$\nB(N_{ss}) = \\alpha + \\beta N_{ss} + \\delta N_{ss} = \\alpha + (\\beta+\\delta)N_{ss}\n$$\nSubstituting $N_{ss} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta-\\beta}$:\n$$\nB(N_{ss}) = \\alpha + (\\beta+\\delta)\\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta-\\beta} = \\alpha \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta+\\delta}{\\delta-\\beta}\\right) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\delta-\\beta+\\beta+\\delta}{\\delta-\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{2\\alpha\\delta}{\\delta-\\beta}\n$$\nThe denominator involves the derivative of the drift term, which is the effective damping:\n$$\nA'(N_{ss}) = \\frac{d}{dN}\\left(\\alpha + (\\beta - \\delta)N\\right)\\Big|_{N=N_{ss}} = \\beta - \\delta\n$$\nNow, we compute the LNA variance:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{LNA} = \\frac{B(N_{ss})}{-2 A'(N_{ss})} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\alpha\\delta}{\\delta-\\beta}}{-2(\\beta-\\delta)} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\alpha\\delta}{\\delta-\\beta}}{2(\\delta-\\beta)} = \\frac{\\alpha\\delta}{(\\delta-\\beta)^2}\n$$\n\n**3. Ratio of Variances**\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the exact stationary variance to the LNA-predicted stationary variance.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{exact}}{\\sigma^2_{LNA}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha\\delta}{(\\delta-\\beta)^2}}{\\frac{\\alpha\\delta}{(\\delta-\\beta)^2}} = 1\n$$\nThe result is exactly $1$. This outcome is not accidental. The Linear Noise Approximation is known to be exact for any chemical reaction network comprised exclusively of zero-order and first-order reactions. In such systems, the propensity functions are linear in the population numbers $n$. This linearity implies that the drift and diffusion coefficients of the Kramers-Moyal expansion are also linear in $n$. While the LNA typically involves linearizing the drift and evaluating the diffusion at a fixed point, the inherent linearity of the drift term $A_1(n) = \\alpha + (\\beta - \\delta)n$ means no approximation is made. For this specific class of problems, the resulting Fokker-Planck equation from the LNA accurately captures the second moment of the exact stationary distribution described by the CME.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2684385"}]}
