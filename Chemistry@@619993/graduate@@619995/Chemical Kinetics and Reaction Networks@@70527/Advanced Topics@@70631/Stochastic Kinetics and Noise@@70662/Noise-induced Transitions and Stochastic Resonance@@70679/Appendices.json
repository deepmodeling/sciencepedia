The changes in copy numbers for reactions $1, 2, 3, 4$ are given by the stoichiometric vectors $\\boldsymbol{s}_1 = (1, 0)^T$, $\\boldsymbol{s}_2 = (-1, 0)^T$, $\\boldsymbol{s}_3 = (-2, 1)^T$, and $\\boldsymbol{s}_4 = (2, -1)^T$. The general form of the CLE, using an independent Wiener process $\\mathrm{d}W_j$ for each reaction channel $j$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\boldsymbol{s}_j a_j(\\boldsymbol{n}, t) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\boldsymbol{s}_j \\sqrt{a_j(\\boldsymbol{n}, t)} \\mathrm{d}W_j $$\nWriting this out for each species:\nFor $n_x$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}n_x = (a_1 - a_2 - 2a_3 + 2a_4)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{a_1}\\mathrm{d}W_1 - \\sqrt{a_2}\\mathrm{d}W_2 - 2\\sqrt{a_3}\\mathrm{d}W_3 + 2\\sqrt{a_4}\\mathrm{d}W_4 $$\nFor $n_d$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}n_d = (a_3 - a_4)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{a_3}\\mathrm{d}W_3 - \\sqrt{a_4}\\mathrm{d}W_4 $$\nwhere the propensities $a_j$ are functions of $n_x, n_d,$ and $t$ as defined in the problem statement.\n\n**b) Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) for $n_x$**\n\nThe variable $n_x$ is fast due to the large degradation rate $\\gamma$. The variable $n_d$ is slow as $k_d$ and $k_r$ are small. We perform a QSSA by assuming that $n_x$ equilibrates instantaneously to a value $n_x^*$ that depends on the current state of the slow variable $n_d$ and time $t$. We set the deterministic part of the CLE for $n_x$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n_x}{\\mathrm{d}t}|_{\\text{det}} = a_1(n_d, t) - a_2(n_x) - 2a_3(n_x) + 2a_4(n_d) = 0 $$\nThe problem instructs to neglect the term from the slow dimerization reaction, $-2a_3(n_x) = -k_d n_x(n_x-1)$, relative to the fast degradation term, $-a_2(n_x) = -\\gamma n_x$. This approximation is justified because the ratio of their characteristic rates $k_d/\\gamma$ is small. However, we must retain the term $2a_4(n_d) = 2k_r n_d$. The QSSA equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ a_1(n_d, t) - a_2(n_x^*) + 2a_4(n_d) = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\right]\\right) - \\gamma n_x^* + 2k_r n_d = 0 $$\nSolving for the quasi-steady-state monomer copy number $n_x^*$:\n$$ n_x^*(n_d, t) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\right] \\right) $$\n\n**c) Effective One-Dimensional Langevin Equation for $n_d$**\n\nTo obtain the effective dynamics for the slow variable $n_d$, we substitute the QSSA result into the CLE for $n_d$. A rigorous procedure involves averaging the propensities over the stationary distribution of the fast variable $n_x$, conditioned on the slow variable $n_d$.\nThe drift term is $f(n_d, t) = \\langle a_3(n_x) - a_4(n_d) \\rangle_{fast} = \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} - a_4(n_d)$.\nFor a fixed $n_d$ and $t$, the dynamics of $n_x$ are approximated as a linear birth-death process with birth rate $B = a_1(n_d, t) + 2k_r n_d$ and death rate per molecule $\\gamma$. The stationary distribution of $n_x$ in this approximation is a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = B/\\gamma = n_x^*(n_d, t)$.\nThe average of the dimerization propensity $a_3(n_x)$ is:\n$$ \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} = \\left\\langle k_d \\frac{n_x(n_x-1)}{2} \\right\\rangle_{fast} = \\frac{k_d}{2} \\langle n_x(n_x-1) \\rangle_{fast} $$\nFor a Poisson-distributed variable with mean $\\lambda$, the second factorial moment is $\\langle k(k-1) \\rangle = \\lambda^2$. Thus:\n$$ \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} = \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 $$\nThe drift of the effective 1D Langevin equation for $n_d$ is therefore:\n$$ f(n_d, t) = \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 - k_r n_d $$\nThe diffusion intensity $g(n_d, t)$ is the sum of the averaged propensities for the reactions affecting $n_d$:\n$$ g(n_d, t) = \\langle a_3(n_x) \\rangle_{fast} + a_4(n_d) = \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 + k_r n_d $$\nThe resulting effective 1D Langevin equation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d} n_{d} = \\left( \\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 - k_r n_d \\right) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{\\frac{k_d}{2} [n_x^*(n_d, t)]^2 + k_r n_d} \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t $$\n\n**d) Explicit Expression for the Drift Term $f(n_d, t)$**\n\nThe final task is to provide the explicit closed-form expression for the drift $f(n_d, t)$. We substitute the expression for $n_x^*(n_d, t)$ from part (b) into the expression for $f(n_d, t)$ found in part (c):\n$$ f(n_d, t) = \\frac{k_d}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\right] \\right) \\right]^2 - k_r n_d $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ f(n_d, t) = \\frac{k_d}{2\\gamma^2} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\right] \\right)^2 - k_r n_d $$\nThis is the final expression for the drift term of the effective Langevin equation for the slow dimer dynamics, which is suitable for analyzing bistability and stochastic resonance in the system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_d}{2\\gamma^2} \\left( \\alpha_{0} + 2k_r n_d + \\alpha_{a}\\,\\frac{n_{d}}{K + n_{d}}\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\right] \\right)^2 - k_r n_d}\n$$", "id": "2659058"}, {"introduction": "Once a system is described by an effective potential $U(x)$, the central dynamic question becomes quantifying the rate of noise-induced escapes from a stable state.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the required quantities. The parameters $A$ and $\\varepsilon$ are symbolic, and the final answer is a ratio, suggesting that these parameters will cancel, which is typical for a well-structured theoretical problem.\nThe problem is not flawed. It is a standard, albeit subtle, problem in statistical physics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two rates, $k_L$ and $k_K$, and their ratio.\n\nFirst, we compute the mean switching rate $k_L$ from first principles. The Langevin equation corresponds to a Smoluchowski (or one-dimensional Fokker-Planck) equation for the probability density $p(x,t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ U'(x)p(x,t) + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right] $$\nThe mean switching rate $k_L$ is the rate constant governing the transition from the low-expression state to the high-expression state. For a bistable system, the kinetics can be coarse-grained into a two-state model $L \\rightleftharpoons H$, described by the rate equations:\n$$ \\frac{dP_L}{dt} = -k_L P_L + k_H P_H $$\n$$ \\frac{dP_H}{dt} = k_L P_L - k_H P_H $$\nwhere $P_L$ and $P_H$ are the probabilities of being in the basin of attraction of $x_L$ and $x_H$, respectively. The quantity we seek, $k_L$, is the forward rate constant.\n\nThe slowest relaxation mode of the system corresponds to the exchange of probability between the two wells. The rate of this relaxation is given by the smallest non-zero eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1$, of the Fokker-Planck operator. This eigenvalue is related to the macroscopic rate constants by $\\lambda_1 = k_L + k_H$.\n\nTo proceed, we must analyze the properties of the potential $U(x)$.\nThe potential minima are at $x_L=1$ and $x_H=3$.\n$U(1) = \\frac{A}{4}(1-1)^2(1-3)^2 = 0$.\n$U(3) = \\frac{A}{4}(3-1)^2(3-3)^2 = 0$.\nThe barrier is at $x_B=2$.\n$U(2) = \\frac{A}{4}(2-1)^2(2-3)^2 = \\frac{A}{4}$.\nThe potential barrier height for the forward transition $L \\to H$ is $\\Delta U_L = U(x_B) - U(x_L) = \\frac{A}{4} - 0 = \\frac{A}{4}$.\nThe barrier for the reverse transition $H \\to L$ is $\\Delta U_H = U(x_B) - U(x_H) = \\frac{A}{4} - 0 = \\frac{A}{4}$.\nSince the barrier heights are equal, the potential is symmetric with respect to the transition states. This implies that the forward and reverse rates are equal in the small noise limit: $k_L = k_H$.\nThus, the relationship between the eigenvalue and the rate simplifies to $\\lambda_1 = 2k_L$, which means $k_L = \\lambda_1/2$.\n\nThe \"first principles\" calculation via singular perturbation theory for the Fokker-Planck equation yields the leading-order asymptotic expression for $\\lambda_1$ in the small noise limit ($\\varepsilon \\to 0$):\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{U''(x_L)|U''(x_B)|}}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U_L}{\\varepsilon}\\right) $$\nWe must calculate the second derivatives of the potential at the minimum and the barrier top.\n$U'(x) = A(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$.\n$U''(x) = A[(x-2)(x-3) + (x-1)(x-3) + (x-1)(x-2)] = A(3x^2 - 12x + 11)$.\nAt the low-expression minimum $x_L = 1$:\n$U''(1) = A(3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 11) = A(3-12+11) = 2A$.\nAt the barrier top $x_B = 2$:\n$U''(2) = A(3(2)^2 - 12(2) + 11) = A(12-24+11) = -A$.\nThe absolute value is $|U''(2)| = A$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\lambda_1$:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{(2A)(A)}}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A/4}{\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{4\\varepsilon}\\right) $$\nThe mean switching rate $k_L$ is half of this value due to the symmetry of the potential:\n$$ k_L = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_1 = \\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{4\\varepsilon}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we compute the Kramers-type barrier-crossing estimate $k_K$. The standard Kramers rate formula for the overdamped regime, corresponding to the given Langevin equation (which has an effective friction coefficient of $\\gamma=1$), is:\n$$ k_K = \\frac{\\sqrt{U''(x_L)|U''(x_B)|}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta U_L}{\\varepsilon}\\right) $$\nThis expression is the result of a flux-over-population calculation, which correctly accounts for the probability of a trajectory recrossing the barrier.

The subtlety lies in correctly identifying the mean switching rate $k_L$ with $\\lambda_1/2$ for a symmetric potential, which is the cornerstone of a rigorous first-principles derivation.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{k_L}{k_K} = \\frac{\\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{4\\varepsilon}\\right)}{\\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{4\\varepsilon}\\right)} = 1 $$\nThe ratio is exactly $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2659063"}, {"introduction": "The definitive signature of stochastic resonance (SR) is the non-monotonic dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on noise strength, where an optimal amount of noise maximally amplifies the response to a weak periodic signal.

No physical units are required in the outputs because the outputs are booleans.\n\nTest suite. Your program must run the following four cases and output the decisions in the specified order:\n\n- Case $1$ (genuine SR expected): $A=\\;0.15$, $f=\\;0.05$, $D\\in\\{0.02,\\,0.05,\\,0.08,\\,0.12,\\,0.18\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;500$.\n- Case $2$ (deterministic entrainment expected): $A=\\;0.80$, $f=\\;0.05$, $D\\in\\{0.00,\\,0.02,\\,0.05,\\,0.08\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;500$.\n- Case $3$ (no drive; non-SR expected): $A=\\;0.00$, $f=\\;0.05$, $D\\in\\{0.02,\\,0.05,\\,0.08,\\,0.12\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;500$.\n- Case $4$ (monotonic over tested range; non-SR expected): $A=\\;0.10$, $f=\\;0.02$, $D\\in\\{0.005,\\,0.010,\\,0.020,\\,0.030\\}$, $\\Delta t=\\;0.02$, $T=\\;800$.\n\nAlgorithmic constraints. Use windowing in the spectral estimate to reduce leakage. The noise-floor estimate must exclude a symmetric neighborhood of at least $\\pm 2$ frequency bins around the drive bin. Use a robust statistic (for example, the median) for the noise floor over a band that does not include zero frequency. Your decision rule must be deterministic for the given random number generator seeds.\n\nFinal output format. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four boolean decisions as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the cases above. For example, the printed line must look like\n$$\n[\\mathrm{True},\\mathrm{False},\\mathrm{False},\\mathrm{False}],\n$$\nbut with the actual decisions your method computes from the simulations.\n\nYour program must be completely self-contained: it must define all the parameters above, generate all data internally, and print only the final result line. No other output is permitted.", "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a computational method to distinguish genuine Stochastic Resonance (SR) from deterministic entrainment or other non-resonant behaviors in a bistable chemical system. The analysis will be based on the system's response to varying thermal noise intensity. This requires simulating the system dynamics, performing spectral analysis to quantify the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and applying a principled decision rule based on the non-monotonic behavior of SNR which is the hallmark of SR.\n\nThe system's dynamics are modeled by the overdamped Langevin equation for a reaction coordinate $x(t)$, which is subjected to a potential force, a periodic driving force, and stochastic thermal fluctuations:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} + A\\cos(2\\pi f t)\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nHere, $x$ is the dimensionless reaction coordinate, $t$ is dimensionless time, $U(x)$ is the bistable potential, $A$ is the amplitude and $f$ is the frequency of the external periodic drive, $D$ is the noise intensity representing thermal energy, and $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process modeling white noise. The potential is a symmetric quartic double-well, given by:\n$$\nU(x) = \\frac{a}{4}x^4 - \\frac{b}{2}x^2\n$$\nWith the specified parameters $a=1$ and $b=1$, the potential becomes $U(x) = \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. This potential has two stable minima at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{b/a} = \\pm 1$, corresponding to two metastable chemical states. These states are separated by a potential barrier at $x=0$ with a height of $\\Delta U = U(0) - U(\\pm 1) = 0 - (\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTo simulate the system's evolution, we must numerically integrate the stochastic differential equation (SDE). The first-order Euler-Maruyama method is a standard and suitable choice for this task. The discretized update rule for the coordinate $x$ at time step $i$ is:\n$$\nx_{i+1} = x_i + \\left[ -(ax_i^3 - bx_i) + A\\cos(2\\pi f t_i) \\right] \\Delta t + \\sqrt{2D\\Delta t} Z_i\n$$\nwhere $t_i = i\\Delta t$, $\\Delta t$ is the time step, and $Z_i$ is a random variable drawn from a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Each simulation is run for a total time $T$, and the initial $10\\%$ of the generated time series is discarded as a transient period to ensure the analysis is performed on the statistically stationary state of the system, starting from an initial condition $x(0)=-1$.\n\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is the key metric for detecting SR. It is estimated from the power spectral density (PSD) of the stationary time series of $x(t)$. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  A Hanning window is applied to the time series data to reduce spectral leakage, which is an artifact of the finite-time Fourier analysis.\n2.  The one-sided PSD is calculated using the real Fast Fourier Transform (`rfft`) of the windowed data. The power $P_k$ at the $k$-th frequency bin is proportional to the squared magnitude of the corresponding Fourier coefficient, $|X_k|^2$.\n3.  The signal power, $S_{sig}$, is defined as the power contained in the single frequency bin $k_f$ that is closest to the external drive frequency $f$.\n4.  The noise power, $S_{noise}$, is a robust estimation of the spectral background near the signal frequency. It is calculated as the median of the power values in a band of frequencies surrounding the signal bin $k_f$. To avoid contamination from the signal peak, a region of $\\pm 2$ bins around $k_f$ is excluded from this calculation.\n5.  The SNR is the dimensionless ratio $SNR = S_{sig} / S_{noise}$.\n\nThe final step is to apply a decision rule to the computed SNR values as a function of noise intensity $D$. For each test case, the SNR is calculated for a given set of $D$ values, $\\{D_j\\}$. The resulting curve, $\\text{SNR}(D)$, is analyzed to determine if SR is present.\n\nHypothesis $\\mathrm{H}_1$ (genuine SR) is accepted if the $\\text{SNR}(D)$ curve exhibits a statistically significant, non-monotonic, unimodal peak. This is formalized by the following conjunctive criteria:\n1.  **Interior Peak**: The maximum SNR must occur at a noise intensity $D_{peak}$ that is strictly between the minimum and maximum tested $D$ values. If the maximum SNR is found at either endpoint of the $D$ range, the behavior is considered monotonic over the tested range, and $\\mathrm{H}_1$ is rejected.\n2.  **Peak Prominence**: The SR peak must be significantly larger than the background signal response at the range boundaries. We quantify this by requiring the maximum SNR, $\\text{SNR}_{max}$, to be greater than the endpoint SNRs by a margin factor $R_{margin}$. The condition is $\\text{SNR}_{max} > R_{margin} \\cdot \\text{SNR}_{first}$ and $\\text{SNR}_{max} > R_{margin} \\cdot \\text{SNR}_{last}$. A value of $R_{margin}=1.25$ is chosen for this rule.\n3.  **Subthreshold Condition**: A strong, or \"suprathreshold\", drive can cause periodic switching even without noise ($D=0$), leading to a high SNR at $D=0$. This is deterministic entrainment, not SR. To distinguish this, if $D=0$ is part of the test set, we impose a stricter requirement: the peak SNR must be substantially greater than the SNR at zero noise. The condition is $\\text{SNR}_{max} > R_{sub} \\cdot \\text{SNR}_{D=0}$, with a chosen margin $R_{sub}=2.0$.\n\nIf all applicable conditions are met for a given test case, the result is `True`, indicating SR. Otherwise, the result is `False`. This deterministic rule, based on physical principles of SR, allows for a robust and reproducible classification of the system's behavior across the provided test cases.
