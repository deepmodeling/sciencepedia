The total enzyme population, with concentration $[E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is a mixture of two subpopulations that do not interact. The total rate is the sum of the rates contributed by each subpopulation.\nSubpopulation $1$ has concentration $[E]_1 = p [E]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, Michaelis constant $K_{M,1}$, and catalytic constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$.

By the AM-HM inequality, this product is always greater than or equal to $1$, with equality holding if and only if $K_{M,1} = K_{M,2}$.

For the stationary two-state CTMC, this autocovariance function is known to decay exponentially with the time lag $\\tau = |t_2-t_1|$:\n$$ C_{\\mathbf{1}}(\\tau) = \\operatorname{Var}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\mathrm{A}\\}}(0)] \\exp(-\\gamma \\tau) $$\nThe variance of the Bernoulli random variable $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\mathrm{A}\\}}(t)$ is $p(1-p)$. This gives:\n$$ C_{\\mathbf{1}}(\\tau) = p(1-p) \\exp(-\\gamma |\\tau|) $$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\alpha+\\beta = 1/\\tau_c$ is the correlation rate. We now evaluate the double integral:\n$$ \\int_0^T \\int_0^T \\exp(-\\gamma |t_2 - t_1|) \\, dt_1 \\, dt_2 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T)) $$\nThis is a standard result. Therefore, the variance of the integrated intensity is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}[\\Lambda_T] = k^2 p(1-p) \\frac{2}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T)) $$\nCombining the terms for the total variance of $N(T)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}[N(T)] = k p T + 2 k^2 p(1-p) \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T)) $$\n\nNow we use the definition of the long-time Fano factor $F_{\\infty}$:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}[N(T)]}{\\mathbb{E}[N(T)]} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{k p T + 2k^2 p(1-p)\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}(\\gamma T - 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma T))}{k p T} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k p T$:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2k(1-p)}{\\gamma^2} \\left(\\gamma - \\frac{1}{T} + \\frac{\\exp(-\\gamma T)}{T}\\right) \\right) $$\nTaking the limit as $T \\to \\infty$, the terms multiplied by $1/T$ and $\\exp(-\\gamma T)/T$ vanish, yielding:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = 1 + \\frac{2k(1-p)}{\\gamma} $$\nThis result shows that the Fano factor's deviation from the Poisson value of $1$ is due to the stochastic switching of the enzyme, quantified by the rates $k$ and $\\gamma$ and the occupation probability $p$.\n\nWe have two equations relating the microscopic parameters to the macroscopic observables:\n1.  $m = kp$\n2.  $F_{\\infty} = 1 + \\frac{2k(1-p)}{\\gamma}$\n\nOur objective is to find $k$. We eliminate the unobserved parameter $p$. From the first equation, $p = m/k$. We substitute this into the second equation:\n$$ F_{\\infty} = 1 + \\frac{2k(1 - m/k)}{\\gamma} = 1 + \\frac{2(k-m)}{\\gamma} $$\nNow, we solve for $k$:\n$$ F_{\\infty} - 1 = \\frac{2(k-m)}{\\gamma} $$\n$$ \\gamma(F_{\\infty} - 1) = 2(k-m) $$\n$$ k-m = \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(F_{\\infty} - 1) $$\n$$ k = m + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(F_{\\infty} - 1) $$\nFinally, using the given relation $\\gamma = 1/\\tau_c$, we arrive at the desired expression for $k$ in terms of the measurable quantities:\n$$ k = m + \\frac{F_{\\infty} - 1}{2\\tau_c} $$\n\nThe final step is to substitute the provided numerical values: $m = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $F_{\\infty} = 2.2$, and $\\tau_c = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$ k = 3.0 + \\frac{2.2 - 1}{2 \\times 0.5} $$\n$$ k = 3.0 + \\frac{1.2}{1.0} $$\n$$ k = 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2 $$\nThe units are in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as expected for a catalytic rate. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. This gives $4.200$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.200}$$", "id": "2677167"}]}
