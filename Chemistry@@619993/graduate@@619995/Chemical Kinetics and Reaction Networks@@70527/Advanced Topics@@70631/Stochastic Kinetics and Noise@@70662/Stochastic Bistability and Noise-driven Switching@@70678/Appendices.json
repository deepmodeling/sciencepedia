It is scientifically grounded in the theory of stochastic processes, specifically birth-death processes as described by the Chemical Master Equation (CME). The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard but non-trivial exercise in chemical kinetics.\n\nThe first task is to derive a general expression for the stationary probability distribution, $p_{n}$, of a one-species birth-death process. The system consists of states $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$ representing the number of molecules. Transitions occur from state $n$ to $n+1$ with propensity $a_{+}(n)$ (birth) and from state $n$ to $n-1$ with propensity $a_{-}(n)$ (death).\n\nThe stationary CME for the probability $p_{n}$ of being in state $n$ is obtained by setting the time derivative of the probability distribution to zero. For a generic state $n \\ge 1$, this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_{n}}{dt} = a_{+}(n-1) p_{n-1} + a_{-}(n+1) p_{n+1} - (a_{+}(n) + a_{-}(n)) p_{n} = 0\n$$\nFor the boundary state $n=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_{0}}{dt} = a_{-}(1) p_{1} - a_{+}(0) p_{0} = 0\n$$\nFor a one-dimensional birth-death chain, the condition of stationarity implies the principle of detailed balance. This principle states that the net probability flux between any two adjacent states must be zero. The flux from state $n$ to $n+1$ is $a_{+}(n)p_{n}$, and the flux from $n+1$ to $n$ is $a_{-}(n+1)p_{n+1}$. At stationarity, these fluxes must be equal for all $n \\ge 0$:\n$$\na_{+}(n) p_{n} = a_{-}(n+1) p_{n+1}\n$$\nThis equation is a fundamental result for one-step birth-death processes and is equivalent to the full stationary master equation. From this, we derive a recurrence relation for the stationary probabilities:\n$$\np_{n+1} = \\frac{a_{+}(n)}{a_{-}(n+1)} p_{n}\n$$\nBy applying this recurrence relation iteratively, we can express any $p_{n}$ in terms of $p_{0}$:\n$$\np_{1} = \\frac{a_{+}(0)}{a_{-}(1)} p_{0}\n$$\n$$\np_{2} = \\frac{a_{+}(1)}{a_{-}(2)} p_{1} = \\frac{a_{+}(1)}{a_{-}(2)} \\frac{a_{+}(0)}{a_{-}(1)} p_{0}\n$$\nProceeding in this manner, we obtain the general closed-form product expression for $p_{n}$:\n$$\np_{n} = p_{0} \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{a_{+}(i)}{a_{-}(i+1)}\n$$\nThe constant $p_{0}$ is a normalization factor determined by the condition $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} p_{n} = 1$. The problem requires the expression up to this factor. Substituting the specific forms of the propensities, $a_{+}(n) = k_{0} + \\frac{k_{1} n^{2}}{K^{2} + n^{2}}$ and $a_{-}(n) = \\gamma n$, yields:\n$$\np_{n} = p_{0} \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{k_{0} + \\frac{k_{1} i^{2}}{K^{2} + i^{2}}}{\\gamma(i+1)}\n$$\nThis expression constitutes the first part of the required answer.\n\nThe second task is to find the integer locations of the local modes of the stationary distribution $\\{p_{n}\\}_{n \\ge 0}$. A local mode at an interior point $n \\ge 1$ is defined by the discrete conditions $p_{n} \\ge p_{n-1}$ and $p_{n} \\ge p_{n+1}$. For the boundary at $n=0$, the condition is simply $p_{0} \\ge p_{1}$.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation $p_{n}/p_{n-1} = a_{+}(n-1)/a_{-}(n)$, the conditions for an interior mode at $n$ become:\n1. $p_{n}/p_{n-1} \\ge 1 \\implies a_{+}(n-1) \\ge a_{-}(n)$\n2. $p_{n+1}/p_{n} \\le 1 \\implies a_{+}(n) \\le a_{-}(n+1)$\n\nThe specific parameter values are $k_{0}=0.1$, $k_{1}=500$, $K=50$, and $\\gamma=4$. The propensities are:\n$a_{+}(n) = 0.1 + \\frac{500 n^{2}}{2500 + n^{2}}$\n$a_{-}(n) = 4n$\n\nFirst, we check for a mode at the boundary $n=0$. The condition is $p_{0} \\ge p_{1}$, which is equivalent to $a_{+}(0) \\le a_{-}(1)$.\nWe calculate:\n$a_{+}(0) = k_{0} = 0.1$\n$a_{-}(1) = \\gamma \\cdot 1 = 4$\nSince $0.1 \\le 4$, the condition is satisfied. Thus, $n=0$ is a local mode.\n\nNext, we search for other modes. These occur where the ratio $p_{n}/p_{n-1}$ transitions from being greater than $1$ to less than $1$. This corresponds to finding an integer $n$ satisfying both $a_{+}(n-1) \\ge a_{-}(n)$ and $a_{+}(n) \\le a_{-}(n+1)$. The bistable nature of the chosen propensities suggests the existence of a second mode. We search for this mode by numerically testing the conditions for integer values of $n$.\n\nLet's test values of $n$ in the region where the second stable fixed point of the corresponding deterministic system is expected. A systematic search reveals the transition occurs near $n=99$. We verify this precisely.\n\nFor $n=98$:\nThe condition $a_{+}(97) \\ge a_{-}(98)$ requires:\n$a_{+}(97) = 0.1 + \\frac{500 \\cdot 97^{2}}{50^{2} + 97^{2}} = 0.1 + \\frac{500 \\cdot 9409}{2500 + 9409} = 0.1 + \\frac{4704500}{11909} \\approx 0.1 + 395.03 = 395.13$.\n$a_{-}(98) = 4 \\cdot 98 = 392$.\nSince $395.13 \\ge 392$, the condition $p_{98} \\ge p_{97}$ holds.\nThe condition $a_{+}(98) \\le a_{-}(99)$ requires:\n$a_{+}(98) = 0.1 + \\frac{500 \\cdot 98^{2}}{50^{2} + 98^{2}} = 0.1 + \\frac{500 \\cdot 9604}{2500 + 9604} = 0.1 + \\frac{4802000}{12104} \\approx 0.1 + 396.71 = 396.81$.\n$a_{-}(99) = 4 \\cdot 99 = 396$.\nThe inequality $396.81 \\le 396$ is false. Thus, $p_{99} > p_{98}$, and $n=98$ is not a mode.\n\nFor $n=99$:\nThe condition $a_{+}(98) \\ge a_{-}(99)$ requires:\n$a_{+}(98) \\approx 396.81$.\n$a_{-}(99) = 396$.\nThe inequality $396.81 \\ge 396$ holds. This implies $p_{99} \\ge p_{98}$.\nThe condition $a_{+}(99) \\le a_{-}(100)$ requires:\n$a_{+}(99) = 0.1 + \\frac{500 \\cdot 99^{2}}{50^{2} + 99^{2}} = 0.1 + \\frac{500 \\cdot 9801}{2500 + 9801} = 0.1 + \\frac{4900500}{12301} \\approx 0.1 + 398.38 = 398.48$.\n$a_{-}(100) = 4 \\cdot 100 = 400$.\nThe inequality $398.48 \\le 400$ holds.

This indicates a local maximum.\n\nThe stationary PDF $P_s(x)$ has two local maxima at $x = -1$ and $x = 1$, and a local minimum between them at $x = 0$. The existence of two peaks (maxima) confirms that the distribution is bimodal. This occurs despite the deterministic drift $f(x)=-x$ having only a single stable fixed point at $x=0$, a phenomenon known as noise-induced bistability.\n\nThe locations of the two peaks are $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2676865"}]}
