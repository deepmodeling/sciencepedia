The concept of mean first passage time and its derivation via first-step analysis are standard, well-established procedures. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete description of a two-state CTMC and asks for a specific, calculable quantity ($T_1$). All necessary parameters ($k_{12}$) are provided for this calculation. The problem is well-posed and admits a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical and scientific terminology. It is free from subjective or speculative content.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical kinetics. The rate $k_{21}$ is specified but is ultimately irrelevant to the calculation of the first passage time *to* state $2$, as the process is defined to stop upon first arrival at this target state. This does not constitute a contradiction but is a common feature of such problems, testing the student's ability to identify relevant information.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the mean first passage time (MFPT) to state $2$, given the system starts in state $1$. Let the state of the system at time $t$ be $X(t) \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The MFPT from state $i$ to state $j$ is denoted $T_{i \\to j}$. Here, we are interested in $T_{1 \\to 2}$, which the problem denotes as $T_1$. Formally, $T_i = E[\\tau_2 | X(0) = i]$, where $\\tau_2 = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : X(t) = 2\\}$ is the first passage time to state $2$.\n\nThe methodology employed will be first-step analysis, which conditions on the first event in an infinitesimal time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\nFirst, we establish the boundary condition. The problem asks for the expected time to reach state $2$ for the first time. If the process starts in state $2$ (i.e., $i=2$), it has already reached the target state at time $t=0$. Therefore, the time taken is zero. The boundary condition is:\n$$T_2 = 0$$\n\nNow, we derive an equation for $T_1$. Consider the system starting in state $1$ at time $t=0$. We analyze the process over a small time interval $[0, \\Delta t]$. According to the properties of a CTMC, the probability of a transition from state $1$ to state $2$ during this interval is $k_{12} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$, where $o(\\Delta t)$ represents terms that go to zero faster than $\\Delta t$. The probability of remaining in state $1$ is correspondingly $1 - k_{12} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$.\n\nBy the law of total expectation, we can write $T_1$ as the sum of the expected outcomes conditioned on what happens in the first interval $\\Delta t$:\n$$T_1 = E[\\tau_2 | \\text{jump to } 2 \\text{ in } \\Delta t] P(\\text{jump to } 2 \\text{ in } \\Delta t) + E[\\tau_2 | \\text{no jump in } \\Delta t] P(\\text{no jump in } \\Delta t)$$\nLet's analyze each term:\n1. If a jump from state $1$ to state $2$ occurs within $\\Delta t$, the time elapsed is approximately $\\Delta t$. Once in state $2$, the remaining expected time to reach state $2$ is $T_2$. The total expected time in this case is $\\Delta t + T_2$.\n2. If no jump occurs, the time elapsed is $\\Delta t$. Due to the memoryless property of the Markov process, the system is still in state $1$, and the remaining expected time to reach state $2$ from this point onward is again $T_1$. The total expected time in this case is $\\Delta t + T_1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation with their respective probabilities gives:\n$$T_1 = (\\Delta t + T_2)(k_{12} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)) + (\\Delta t + T_1)(1 - k_{12} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t))$$\nNow, we substitute the boundary condition $T_2=0$:\n$$T_1 = (\\Delta t)(k_{12} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)) + (\\Delta t + T_1)(1 - k_{12} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t))$$\nExpanding the expression:\n$$T_1 = k_{12} (\\Delta t)^2 + \\Delta t \\cdot o(\\Delta t) + \\Delta t - k_{12} T_1 \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t) + T_1 - k_{12} T_1 \\Delta t - o(\\Delta t)$$\nWe collect terms and recognize that $(\\Delta t)^2$ terms and $o(\\Delta t)$ terms are of higher order and can be consolidated into a single $o(\\Delta t)$ term:\n$$T_1 = T_1 + \\Delta t - k_{12} T_1 \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$$\nSubtracting $T_1$ from both sides yields:\n$$0 = \\Delta t - k_{12} T_1 \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$$\nDividing the entire equation by $\\Delta t$ (for $\\Delta t \\neq 0$):\n$$0 = 1 - k_{12} T_1 + \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}$ goes to $0$ by definition. This yields the final linear equation for $T_1$:\n$$1 - k_{12} T_1 = 0$$\nThis is the equation for $T_1$ requested by the problem. Solving for $T_1$ is trivial:\n$$k_{12} T_1 = 1$$\n$$T_1 = \\frac{1}{k_{12}}$$\n\nThis result is physically intuitive. The system is in state $1$, and the only escape pathway leads to the target state $2$. The waiting time in state $1$ is exponentially distributed with rate parameter $k_{12}$. The mean of this exponential distribution is $1/k_{12}$. Therefore, the average time to leave state $1$ (and thus arrive at state $2$ for the first time) is precisely $1/k_{12}$. The rate $k_{21}$ is irrelevant because the process is defined to stop once state $2$ is reached, making it an absorbing state for this specific calculation. If the rates $k_{12}$ and $k_{21}$ have units of inverse seconds ($s^{-1}$), then $T_1$ will have units of seconds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{k_{12}}}$$", "id": "2654448"}, {"introduction": "Having established the logic of first-step analysis, we now generalize this method to handle more complex reaction networks with multiple transient states.

The activated state $S_1$ has a longer MFPT than $S_2$ because its total exit rate is lower ($2 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), and there is a non-zero probability of returning to the initial state $S_0$, which is further from the goal.\n\nThe problem asks for the MFPT to absorption starting from $S_0$, which is $m_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{25}{17}}$$", "id": "2654482"}, {"introduction": "We now apply our understanding of MFPT analysis to the birth-death process, a foundational model in chemical kinetics and population dynamics.
