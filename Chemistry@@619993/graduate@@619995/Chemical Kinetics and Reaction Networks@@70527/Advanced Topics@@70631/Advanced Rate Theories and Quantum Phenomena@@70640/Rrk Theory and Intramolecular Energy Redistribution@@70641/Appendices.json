It presents a standard exercise in the derivation of the classical Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel (RRK) rate constant from first principles. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with the foundational assumptions of the model. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe microcanonical rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)$, is defined as the product of a frequency factor, $\\nu$, and the probability, $P(E, E_0, s)$, that the molecule is in a reactive configuration. A reactive configuration is one where the energy in a single, specific vibrational mode (the reaction coordinate) is greater than or equal to a critical energy threshold, $E_0$.\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\nu P(E, E_0, s)$$\nThe problem assumes rapid intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR), implying that all microstates at a total energy $E$ are equally probable. The probability $P(E, E_0, s)$ is therefore the ratio of the volume of phase space corresponding to reactive states to the total volume of accessible phase space.\n\nWe are treating the $s$ vibrational modes as classical oscillators. The central task is to compute the statistical probability that one specific oscillator, let's say oscillator $1$, has energy $e_1 \\ge E_0$, given that the total energy $\\sum_{i=1}^{s} e_i = E$.\n\nThe probability that oscillator $1$ has energy in an infinitesimal range $[e_1, e_1 + de_1]$ is proportional to the number of ways the remaining energy, $E - e_1$, can be distributed among the other $s-1$ oscillators. This is given by the density of states of the $s-1$ oscillators at energy $E - e_1$, which we denote $\\rho_{s-1}(E - e_1)$. For a system of $k$ classical oscillators, the density of states at energy $\\mathcal{E}$ is proportional to $\\mathcal{E}^{k-1}$. Thus, $\\rho_{s-1}(E - e_1) \\propto (E - e_1)^{s-2}$.\n\nThe total number of states, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is proportional to the integral of this density over all possible energies of the first oscillator, from $e_1=0$ to $e_1=E$.\n$$N_{\\text{total}} \\propto \\int_{0}^{E} \\rho_{s-1}(E - e_1) de_1 = \\int_{0}^{E} C (E - e_1)^{s-2} de_1$$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant. The integral evaluates to:\n$$\\int_{0}^{E} C (E - e_1)^{s-2} de_1 = C \\left[ -\\frac{(E-e_1)^{s-1}}{s-1} \\right]_{0}^{E} = C \\frac{E^{s-1}}{s-1}$$\nSo, $N_{\\text{total}} \\propto E^{s-1}$.\n\nThe number of reactive states, $N_{\\text{reactive}}$, corresponds to configurations where $e_1 \\ge E_0$. This is found by integrating the same density of states but over the range $e_1 \\in [E_0, E]$.\n$$N_{\\text{reactive}} \\propto \\int_{E_0}^{E} \\rho_{s-1}(E - e_1) de_1 = \\int_{E_0}^{E} C (E - e_1)^{s-2} de_1$$\nThis integral evaluates to:\n$$\\int_{E_0}^{E} C (E - e_1)^{s-2} de_1 = C \\left[ -\\frac{(E-e_1)^{s-1}}{s-1} \\right]_{E_0}^{E} = C \\frac{(E-E_0)^{s-1}}{s-1}$$\nSo, $N_{\\text{reactive}} \\propto (E-E_0)^{s-1}$. This is valid for $E \\ge E_0$; if $E < E_0$, the number of reactive states is $0$.\n\nThe probability of reaction is the ratio $N_{\\text{reactive}} / N_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$P(E, E_0, s) = \\frac{(E-E_0)^{s-1}}{E^{s-1}} = \\left( \\frac{E-E_0}{E} \\right)^{s-1} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{E_0}{E} \\right)^{s-1}$$\nSubstituting this probability into the expression for the rate constant gives the desired analytical formula:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\nu \\left( 1 - \\frac{E_0}{E} \\right)^{s-1}$$\nThis is the first part of the solution.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the specified parameters: $s=6$, $E=2E_0$, and $\\nu = 1.00 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(2E_0) = (1.00 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{E_0}{2E_0} \\right)^{6-1}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(2E_0) = (1.00 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{5}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(2E_0) = (1.00 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{5}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(2E_0) = (1.00 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\frac{1}{32}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(2E_0) = (1.00 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 0.03125$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(2E_0) = 3.125 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe result is required to four significant figures, which is already satisfied by $3.125 \\times 10^{11}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the scaling of $k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)$ with $s$ for a fixed energy ratio $E/E_0$. Let $R = E/E_0$ be a constant where $R > 1$. The rate expression becomes $k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\nu(1 - 1/R)^{s-1}$. Since $R > 1$, the base of the power, $(1-1/R)$, is a positive number strictly less than $1$. As $s$ increases, raising a number between $0$ and $1$ to a larger power, $s-1$, results in a smaller value.

All necessary parameters and theoretical frameworks are provided. The problem is valid, and a rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe objective is to derive the microcanonical rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)$ and $k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)$ for a model system and then to determine their ratio $R(E) = k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)/k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel (RRK) rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)$. The RRK model, in its classical formulation, considers the statistical distribution of a total energy $E$ among $s$ equivalent harmonic oscillators. Reaction is assumed to occur when the energy in a specific oscillator, the reactive mode, exceeds a critical energy $E_{0}$. The rate of reaction is then the product of an attempt frequency, $\\nu$, and the probability that the reactive mode has energy of at least $E_{0}$.\n\nFor a system of $s$ classical harmonic oscillators with total energy $E$, the probability density function for finding an energy $\\epsilon$ in one particular oscillator is proportional to the density of states of the remaining $s-1$ oscillators at energy $E-\\epsilon$. For classical oscillators, the density of states is proportional to the energy raised to the power of the number of oscillators minus one. Thus, the probability density $P(\\epsilon)$ is given by:\n$$P(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon \\propto (E-\\epsilon)^{s-2} d\\epsilon$$\nTo find the probability, we normalize this distribution over its entire range, from $\\epsilon=0$ to $\\epsilon=E$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{E} C(E-\\epsilon)^{s-2} d\\epsilon = 1$$\nwhere $C$ is the normalization constant. The integral evaluates to $C \\left[ -\\frac{(E-\\epsilon)^{s-1}}{s-1} \\right]_{0}^{E} = C \\frac{E^{s-1}}{s-1} = 1$, which gives $C = \\frac{s-1}{E^{s-1}}$.\nThe probability of reaction, $P_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$, is the probability that the energy in the reactive mode is greater than or equal to $E_{0}$. This is found by integrating the normalized probability density from $E_{0}$ to $E$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E) = \\int_{E_{0}}^{E} \\frac{s-1}{E^{s-1}} (E-\\epsilon)^{s-2} d\\epsilon$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E) = \\frac{s-1}{E^{s-1}} \\left[ -\\frac{(E-\\epsilon)^{s-1}}{s-1} \\right]_{E_{0}}^{E} = \\frac{s-1}{E^{s-1}} \\left( 0 - \\left( -\\frac{(E-E_{0})^{s-1}}{s-1} \\right) \\right) = \\left(\\frac{E-E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{s-1}$$\nThe RRK rate constant is the product of this probability and the attempt frequency $\\nu$. Given $s=3$ effective oscillators, the expression becomes:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\nu P_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E) = \\nu \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{3-1} = \\nu \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis rate is non-zero only for $E \\ge E_{0}$, which can be formally included using the Heaviside step function, $\\Theta(E-E_{0})$.\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\nu \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2} \\Theta(E-E_{0})$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)$. This theory is based on the microcanonical formulation of Transition State Theory (TST), where the rate is given by the ratio of the flux through the transition state dividing surface to the population of reactant states at energy $E$. The expression is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{0})}{h \\rho(E)}$$\nwhere $N^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{0})$ is the sum of states of the transition state (TS) with available energy up to $E-E_{0}$, $\\rho(E)$ is the density of states of the reactant molecule at energy $E$, and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nWe will use the semiclassical (high-energy classical limit) formulas for the sum of states, $N(E)$, and density of states, $\\rho(E)$, for a system of $n$ separable harmonic oscillators with angular frequencies $\\omega_{i}$:\n$$N(E) = \\frac{E^{n}}{n! \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\hbar\\omega_{i}}$$\n$$\\rho(E) = \\frac{d N(E)}{dE} = \\frac{E^{n-1}}{(n-1)! \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\hbar\\omega_{i}}$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nFor the reactant, we have $s=3$ vibrational modes with angular frequencies $\\omega_{1}$, $\\omega_{2}$, and $\\omega_{r}$. The reactant density of states is:\n$$\\rho(E) = \\frac{E^{3-1}}{(3-1)! (\\hbar\\omega_{1})(\\hbar\\omega_{2})(\\hbar\\omega_{r})} = \\frac{E^{2}}{2 \\hbar^{3} \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{r}}$$\n\nFor the transition state, the reactive mode is converted into translational motion over the barrier. The TS is defined as having the remaining $s-1=2$ vibrational modes, with frequencies $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$. The energy available to these modes is the total energy $E$ minus the barrier height $E_{0}$. The sum of states for the transition state is:\n$$N^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{0}) = \\frac{(E-E_{0})^{2}}{2! (\\hbar\\omega_{1})(\\hbar\\omega_{2})} = \\frac{(E-E_{0})^{2}}{2 \\hbar^{2} \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the RRKM rate equation:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{0})}{h \\rho(E)} = \\frac{1}{h} \\frac{\\frac{(E-E_{0})^{2}}{2 \\hbar^{2} \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2}}}{\\frac{E^{2}}{2 \\hbar^{3} \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{r}}}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common terms ($2$, $\\hbar^{2}$, $\\omega_{1}$, $\\omega_{2}$):\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{1}{h} \\frac{(E-E_{0})^{2}}{E^{2}} \\frac{\\hbar^{3} \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2} \\omega_{r}}{\\hbar^{2} \\omega_{1} \\omega_{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{r}}{h} \\left(\\frac{E-E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2}$$\nUsing the relation $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$, we obtain:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{\\omega_{r}}{2\\pi} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2}$$\nThis expression is also valid for $E \\ge E_{0}$, so we can write:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{\\omega_{r}}{2\\pi} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2} \\Theta(E-E_{0})$$\nNote that $\\omega_r/(2\\pi)$ is the frequency $\\nu_r$ of the reactive mode harmonic oscillator. RRKM theory thus provides a first-principles identification for the attempt frequency.\n\nFinally, we find the ratio $R(E) = k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)/k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)$. For energies $E > E_0$ where the rates are non-zero:\n$$R(E) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)}{k_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)} = \\frac{\\nu \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2}}{\\frac{\\omega_{r}}{2\\pi} \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{0}}{E}\\right)^{2}}$$\nThe energy-dependent term $\\left(1 - E_{0}/E\\right)^{2}$ cancels out completely.\n$$R(E) = \\frac{\\nu}{\\frac{\\omega_{r}}{2\\pi}} = \\frac{2\\pi\\nu}{\\omega_{r}}$$\nThe ratio $R(E)$ is a constant, independent of the total energy $E$.

In many unimolecular reaction scenarios, the measured survival probability $S(t)$ deviates from a single exponential, which can be rationalized by heterogeneity in microcanonical decay rates arising from partial intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). In the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel (RRK) microcanonical picture, a unimolecular decay at fixed total energy is governed by the requirement that a critical energy $E_0$ be localized within a reactive subspace of vibrational modes; partial IVR restricts the energy flow to an effective subspace rather than the full set of modes.\n\nStarting from the following foundational elements:\n- For a sub-ensemble with a time-independent first-order rate constant $k$, the survival is $e^{-k t}$.\n- An ensemble with heterogeneous $k$ values has survival $S(t)$ equal to the average of $e^{-k t}$ over the ensemble, i.e., the Laplace transform of the rate distribution.\n- In the RRK microcanonical framework, for available energy $E_{\\text{avail}}$ in the reactive subspace of $m$ effective modes, the rate increases with the fraction of available energy above threshold and vanishes when $E_{\\text{avail}} \\lt E_0$.\n- Partial IVR can be modeled by introducing a random fraction $\\phi \\in [0,1]$ of the total energy $E_{\\text{tot}}$ that is dynamically available to the reactive subspace, so that $E_{\\text{avail}} = \\phi E_{\\text{tot}}$.

The integration domain $[0, 1]$ must be split at the threshold $\\phi = \\epsilon_0$:\n$$S(t) = \\int_0^{\\epsilon_0} e^{-k(\\phi)t} g(\\phi; \\alpha, \\beta) d\\phi + \\int_{\\epsilon_0}^1 e^{-k(\\phi)t} g(\\phi; \\alpha, \\beta) d\\phi$$\nFor the first integral (sub-threshold fraction, $\\phi < \\epsilon_0$), $k(\\phi)=0$. This term represents the total probability of the non-reactive population:\n$$\\int_0^{\\epsilon_0} g(\\phi; \\alpha, \\beta) d\\phi = I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta)$$\nwhere $I_x(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the regularized incomplete beta function, which is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Beta distribution.\nFor the second integral (super-threshold fraction, $\\phi \\ge \\epsilon_0$), $k(\\phi)$ is non-zero. This term is the survival contribution from the reactive population:\n$$\\int_{\\epsilon_0}^1 \\exp\\left[-\\nu t \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{\\phi}\\right)^{m-1}\\right] g(\\phi; \\alpha, \\beta) d\\phi$$\nCombining these, the complete expression for $S(t)$ when $0 \\le \\epsilon_0 < 1$ is:\n$$S(t) = I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta) + \\int_{\\epsilon_0}^1 \\exp\\left[-\\nu t \\left(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{\\phi}\\right)^{m-1}\\right] \\frac{\\phi^{\\alpha-1}(1-\\phi)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} d\\phi$$\nThis general expression is not analytically integrable for arbitrary parameters and must be evaluated numerically.\n\nSpecial limiting cases serve as validation:\n- If $E_0=0$, then $\\epsilon_0=0$. The rate $k(\\phi) = \\nu$ becomes constant for all $\\phi > 0$. The decay is a single exponential: $S(t) = e^{-\\nu t}$.\n- If $m=1$, the rate for $\\phi \\ge \\epsilon_0$ simplifies to $k(\\phi) = \\nu$. The system reduces to a two-state mixture: a non-reactive fraction $I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta)$ and a reactive fraction $1-I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta)$ that decays with rate $\\nu$. The survival is $S(t) = I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta) + (1-I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta))e^{-\\nu t}$.\n\nThe numerical implementation proceeds as follows. A function is constructed to compute $S(t)$ given a set of parameters $(\\nu, E_0, E_{\\text{tot}}, m, \\alpha, \\beta, t)$.\n1.  Calculate $\\epsilon_0 = E_0/E_{\\text{tot}}$.\n2.  If $\\epsilon_0 \\ge 1$, the function returns $1.0$.\n3.  If $0 \\le \\epsilon_0 < 1$, the function computes the two components of $S(t)$. The first term, $I_{\\epsilon_0}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, is computed using the CDF of the Beta distribution, available in `scipy.stats.beta`. The second term, the integral over the reactive population, is computed using numerical quadrature via `scipy.integrate.quad`.\n4.  The final result is the sum of these two components.
