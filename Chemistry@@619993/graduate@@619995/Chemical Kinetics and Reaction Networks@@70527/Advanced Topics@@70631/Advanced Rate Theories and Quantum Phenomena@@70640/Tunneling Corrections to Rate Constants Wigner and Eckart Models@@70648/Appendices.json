For a symmetric parabolic barrier, this correction can be derived from the partition function of a harmonic oscillator through analytic continuation.\n\nThe partition function for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\nu$ at temperature $T$ is given by\n$$ q_{\\text{Q}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_n}{k_B T}\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h\\nu(n + 1/2)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\exp(-h\\nu/2k_B T)}{1-\\exp(-h\\nu/k_B T)} $$\nThis can be rewritten using the identity $\\sinh(x) = (\\exp(x)-\\exp(-x))/2$ as\n$$ q_{\\text{Q}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sinh(h\\nu/2k_B T)} $$\nThe classical partition function, obtained in the high-temperature limit ($h\\nu \\ll k_B T$), is\n$$ q_{\\text{C}} = \\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu} $$\nIn transition state theory (TST), the rate constant is proportional to the partition function of the activated complex. The motion along the reaction coordinate at the saddle point is treated as translation. The quantum correction for this motion across the barrier is found by replacing the classical description with a quantum one. We obtain the tunneling correction factor by taking the ratio of the quantum to classical \"partition functions\" for this unbound motion. This is achieved by analytical continuation of the corresponding ratio for a stable harmonic oscillator. Let $u = h\\nu/k_B T$. The ratio for a stable oscillator is\n$$ \\frac{q_{\\text{Q}}}{q_{\\text{C}}} = \\frac{u}{2\\sinh(u/2)} $$\nTo model the inverted barrier, we substitute the real frequency $\\nu$ with the imaginary frequency $i|\\nu^{\\ddagger}|$. This corresponds to replacing the real parameter $u$ with the imaginary parameter $i u^{\\ddagger}$, where $u^{\\ddagger}$ is the real quantity $u^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{h|\\nu^{\\ddagger}|}{k_B T}$. Using the identity $\\sinh(ix) = i\\sin(x)$, the ratio becomes the full tunneling correction for a parabolic barrier (the Bell correction):\n$$ \\kappa(T) = \\frac{i u^{\\ddagger}}{2\\sinh(i u^{\\ddagger}/2)} = \\frac{i u^{\\ddagger}}{2i\\sin(u^{\\ddagger}/2)} = \\frac{u^{\\ddagger}/2}{\\sin(u^{\\ddagger}/2)} $$\nThe problem uses the imaginary wavenumber magnitude $\\tilde{\\nu}^{\\ddagger}$, where $|\\nu^{\\ddagger}| = c\\tilde{\\nu}^{\\ddagger}$. So, $u^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}$.\n\nThe Wigner correction, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{W}}(T)$, is the leading-order correction, valid for weak tunneling, which corresponds to small $u^{\\ddagger}$.

It is defined by the equality of the lowest nonzero thermal (Matsubara) frequency and the magnitude of the imaginary barrier frequency. The lowest nonzero Matsubara frequency is given by $2\\pi k_B T/\\hbar$, while the barrier mode near the transition state is characterized by an imaginary angular frequency $i\\,\\omega^\\ddagger$ with magnitude $\\omega^\\ddagger>0$.\n\nSetting these equal at $T=T_c$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi k_B T_c}{\\hbar} \\;=\\; \\omega^\\ddagger.\n$$\nSolving for $T_c$ yields\n$$\nT_c \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hbar\\,\\omega^\\ddagger}{2\\pi k_B}.\n$$\n\nThe reported spectroscopic wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger$ is related to the linear frequency $\\nu^\\ddagger$ by\n$$\n\\nu^\\ddagger \\;=\\; c\\,\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger,\n$$\nand the corresponding angular frequency is\n$$\n\\omega^\\ddagger \\;=\\; 2\\pi \\nu^\\ddagger \\;=\\; 2\\pi c\\,\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $T_c$ gives\n$$\nT_c \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hbar\\,(2\\pi c\\,\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger)}{2\\pi k_B} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hbar c}{k_B}\\,\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger.\n$$\n\nThus, the crossover temperature in terms of the reported wavenumber is\n$$\nT_c \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hbar c}{k_B}\\,\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger.\n$$\n\nFor the given $\\tilde{\\nu}^\\ddagger = 1400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, we evaluate numerically at the final step. It is convenient to note that\n$$\n\\frac{h c}{k_B} \\;\\text{(in K·cm)} \\;=\\; 1.438776877\\ \\text{K·cm},\n$$\nand $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, so\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar c}{k_B} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\,\\frac{h c}{k_B} \\;=\\; \\frac{1.438776877\\ \\text{K·cm}}{2\\pi}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nT_c \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1.438776877}{2\\pi}\\right)\\times 1400\\ \\text{K}.\n$$\nCarrying out the arithmetic,\n$$\n\\frac{1.438776877}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.228989,\\quad\nT_c \\approx 0.228989 \\times 1400 \\approx 320.6\\ \\text{K}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is\n$$\nT_c \\approx 321\\ \\text{K}.\n$$\n\nAssessment of Wigner’s correction at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$: The Wigner tunneling correction can be viewed as a high-temperature expansion of the transmission coefficient in even powers of the small parameter\n$$\nx \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hbar \\omega^\\ddagger}{k_B T}.\n$$\nIt is appropriate when $x \\ll 1$, equivalently when $T \\gg T_c$ because\n$$\nx \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hbar \\omega^\\ddagger}{k_B T} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\pi k_B T_c}{k_B T} \\;=\\; 2\\pi\\,\\frac{T_c}{T}.\n$$\nFor this system, $T_c \\approx 321\\,\\mathrm{K}$, so at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ one has $T<T_c$ and hence $x \\gtrsim 2\\pi$, which is not small. This places the reaction in (or beyond) the onset of deep-tunneling conditions where the parabolic-top, second-order Wigner correction is not quantitatively reliable. A more suitable treatment would be an Eckart-barrier correction or a semiclassical instanton approach.\n\nOnly the crossover temperature is required as the final numerical answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{321}$$", "id": "2691054"}]}
