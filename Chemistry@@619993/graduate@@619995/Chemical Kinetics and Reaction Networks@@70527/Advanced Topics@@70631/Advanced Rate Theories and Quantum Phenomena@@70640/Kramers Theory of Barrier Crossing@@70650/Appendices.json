The steady state is canonical at an effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=(\\tilde{\\gamma}/\\gamma)\\,T$: $f_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x,v)\\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-[(m v^2/2)+U(x)]/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T_{\\mathrm{eff}})\\big)$; the irreversible probability current vanishes (only the reversible Hamiltonian circulation remains), and the average steady heat rate into the viscous environment equals $(\\gamma-\\tilde{\\gamma})\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,T$ multiplied by $(-1)$, that is, $(\\tilde{\\gamma}-\\gamma)\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,T$ with the sign indicating the direction of heat flow.\n**Correct**. This statement accurately describes the steady-state distribution, the nature of the probability current, and the net heat flow rate, as derived above. The convoluted phrasing for the heat flow, $(\\gamma-\\tilde{\\gamma})\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,T$ multiplied by $(-1)$, simplifies precisely to our result $(\\tilde{\\gamma}-\\gamma)\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,T$.\n\nC. No normalizable steady state exists for $\\tilde{\\gamma}>\\gamma$ because the injected noise overwhelms dissipation, and the average steady heat rate into the viscous environment diverges.\n**Incorrect**. We found a normalizable steady state for any $\\gamma, \\tilde{\\gamma} > 0$ due to the confining potential $U(x)$. The heat rate is finite, equal to $(\\tilde{\\gamma}-\\gamma)k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\n\nD. The steady state factorizes at $T$ but exhibits finite cross-correlation: $f_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x,v)\\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-U(x)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)\\big)\\exp\\!\\big(-m v^2/(2 k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)\\big)$ with $\\langle x v\\rangle\\neq 0$, and the average steady heat rate into the viscous environment equals $\\tilde{\\gamma}\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,T$.\n**Incorrect**. The distribution is at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, not $T$. The cross-correlation $\\langle xv \\rangle_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is zero because the steady-state distribution $f_{\\mathrm{ss}}(x,v)$ is an even function of velocity $v$, and the integration interval for $v$ is symmetric about zero. The value $\\tilde{\\gamma}\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,T$ represents the gross dissipated power, not the net heat flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2651789"}]}
