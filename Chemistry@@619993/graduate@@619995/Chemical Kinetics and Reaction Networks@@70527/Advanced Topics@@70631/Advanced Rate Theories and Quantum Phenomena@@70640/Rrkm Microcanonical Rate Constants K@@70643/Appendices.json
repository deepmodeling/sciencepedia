It is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental expression for the microcanonical rate constant $k(E)$ in RRKM theory is derived from transition-state theory. It relates the rate to the ratio of the total number of accessible states at the transition state (the \"critical configuration\") to the density of states of the reactant molecule at a given total energy $E$. The expression is:\n$$\nk(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E)}{h \\rho(E)}\n$$\nHere, $N^{\\ddagger}(E)$ is the sum of states of the transition state from the ground state up to energy $E$, which is a dimensionless quantity. The term $\\rho(E)$ is the density of states of the reactant molecule at energy $E$, defined as $\\rho(E) = \\mathrm{d}N(E)/\\mathrm{d}E$, where $N(E)$ is the total number of reactant states up to energy $E$. The constant $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\n(a) Our first task is to establish unit conventions and derive a conversion factor. The rate constant $k(E)$ is required to have units of inverse time, specifically $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Let us analyze the dimensions of the equation for $k(E)$.\nThe sum of states $N^{\\ddagger}(E)$ is a pure number and is therefore dimensionless.\nPlanck's constant $h$ has units of energy multiplied by time, which in SI units is $\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$.\nFor the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the product $h \\rho(E)$ must have units of time, so that its reciprocal gives units of inverse time.\n$$\n\\text{units}[k(E)] = \\frac{\\text{units}[N^{\\ddagger}(E)]}{\\text{units}[h] \\cdot \\text{units}[\\rho(E)]} = \\frac{1}{(\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}) \\cdot \\text{units}[\\rho(E)]} = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFrom this, it is clear that the units of $\\rho(E)$ must be $\\mathrm{J}^{-1}$. This is consistent with its definition as the derivative of the dimensionless number of states $N$ with respect to energy $E$.\n\nNext, we address the conversion from the energy-based density of states, $\\rho(E)$, to the wavenumber-based density of states, $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu})$.\nThe energy $E$ of a photon is related to its wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ via the fundamental relation $E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\nThe density of states with respect to energy is $\\rho(E) = \\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}E$.\nThe density of states with respect to wavenumber is defined as $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu}) = \\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}$.\nTo relate these two quantities, we use the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\rho(E) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}E} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nFrom the relation $E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$, we can express $\\tilde{\\nu}$ as a function of $E$: $\\tilde{\\nu} = E/(hc)$.\nDifferentiating $\\tilde{\\nu}$ with respect to $E$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\tilde{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}E} = \\frac{1}{hc}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the chain rule expression, we obtain the relationship between $\\rho(E)$ and $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu})$:\n$$\n\\rho(E) = \\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu}) \\frac{1}{hc}\n$$\nThis equation is the required conversion. Planck's constant $h$ and the speed of light $c$ appear as the factor $1/(hc)$. We must be careful with units. If $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu})$ is given in states per $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, its units are effectively $(\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^{-1}$ or $\\mathrm{cm}$. If $h$ is in $\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$ and $c$ is in $\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$, then the product $hc$ has units of $\\mathrm{J \\cdot cm}$. The resulting units for $\\rho(E)$ are $\\mathrm{cm} / (\\mathrm{J \\cdot cm}) = \\mathrm{J}^{-1}$, which is precisely the unit of inverse energy as required.\n\n(b) For the second part, we must compute the numerical value of $k(E)$. We start by substituting the expression for $\\rho(E)$ derived in part (a) into the fundamental RRKM rate equation:\n$$\nk(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E)}{h \\rho(E)} = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E)}{h \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu})}{hc} \\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression reveals that Planck's constant $h$ cancels out:\n$$\nk(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E) c}{\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu})}\n$$\nThis is a convenient result which simplifies the calculation. We are given the following values:\n- $N^{\\ddagger}(E) = 1.47 \\times 10^{21}$ (dimensionless)\n- $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\tilde{\\nu}) = 2.94 \\times 10^{32}$ states per $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.

The exponent on $10$ is $21 + 10 - 32 = -1$.\n$$\nk(E) = 0.5 \\cdot (2.99792458) \\cdot 10^{-1} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk(E) = 0.5 \\cdot 0.299792458 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk(E) = 0.149896229 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $4$, $9$, $8$.

It is a standard, non-trivial derivation in theoretical chemistry that tests fundamental knowledge. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the classical density and sum of states for a collection of harmonic oscillators. We use the method of phase-space volume calculation. For a system of $s$ classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillators with frequencies $\\{\\nu_k\\}_{k=1}^s$, the Hamiltonian is $H = \\sum_{k=1}^s H_k(q_k, p_k)$. The phase-space volume for a single oscillator with energy less than or equal to $\\epsilon_k$ is the area of the ellipse $p_k^2/(2m_k) + (1/2)m_k(2\\pi\\nu_k)^2 q_k^2 \\le \\epsilon_k$, which is given by $\\text{Area}_k = \\epsilon_k/\\nu_k$.\n\nThe total phase-space volume for $s$ oscillators with total energy less than or equal to $E$ is given by the integral over the allowed energy domain:\n$$\n\\Phi(E) = \\int_{\\sum_{k=1}^s \\epsilon_k \\le E} \\prod_{k=1}^s d(\\text{Area}_k) = \\int_{\\sum_{k=1}^s \\epsilon_k \\le E} \\prod_{k=1}^s \\frac{d\\epsilon_k}{\\nu_k}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\Phi(E) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{k=1}^s \\nu_k} \\int_{\\sum_{k=1}^s \\epsilon_k \\le E, \\epsilon_k \\ge 0} d\\epsilon_1 \\dots d\\epsilon_s\n$$\nThe integral represents the volume of an $s$-dimensional simplex of side length $E$, which is equal to $E^s/s!$. Thus, the phase-space volume is:\n$$\n\\Phi(E) = \\frac{E^s}{s! \\prod_{k=1}^s \\nu_k}\n$$\nThe number of quantum states, $N(E)$, is obtained by dividing the phase-space volume by $h^s$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $s$ is the number of degrees of freedom (here, $s$ oscillators, so $s$ coordinates and $s$ momenta).\n$$\nN(E) = \\frac{\\Phi(E)}{h^s} = \\frac{E^s}{h^s s! \\prod_{k=1}^s \\nu_k}\n$$\nThis is the cumulative sum of states.

The units provided (kJ/mol, THz, J s) require standard conversion, which is part of the problem-solving process, not a flaw in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Cumulative Number of States, $N^{\\ddagger}(\\varepsilon)$**\n\nThe cumulative number of states, or sum of states, $N(\\varepsilon)$, for a system with energy up to $\\varepsilon$ is classically given by the accessible phase-space volume $\\Gamma(\\varepsilon)$ divided by $h^D$, where $D$ is the number of degrees of freedom. For a set of $s$ separable one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, there are $s$ position and $s$ momentum coordinates, so a total of $2s$ phase-space dimensions exist, but traditionally in this context, the quantization is applied per oscillator, corresponding to a phase space volume of $h$ per state. Thus, we divide the total phase-space volume by $h^s$.\n\n$$N(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\varepsilon)}{h^s}$$\n\nThe total classical Hamiltonian for $s$ separable harmonic oscillators is $H = \\sum_{i=1}^s H_i$, where $H_i = \\frac{p_i^2}{2m_i} + \\frac{1}{2}k_i q_i^2$ is the energy of the $i$-th oscillator. The phase-space volume is the integral over all coordinates and momenta such that the total energy is less than or equal to $\\varepsilon$:\n\n$$\\Gamma(\\varepsilon) = \\int_{ \\sum H_i \\le \\varepsilon } \\prod_{i=1}^s dq_i dp_i$$\n\nThe phase-space volume for a single oscillator with energy up to $\\varepsilon_i$ is the area of the ellipse defined by $H_i = \\varepsilon_i$, which is $\\frac{\\varepsilon_i}{\\nu_i}$. The total phase-space volume for $s$ oscillators is found by integrating over the distribution of total energy $\\varepsilon$ among the $s$ modes. A more direct method is to use the known result for the volume of a hyper-polyhedron. The phase space volume for $s$ oscillators with total energy up to $\\varepsilon$ is given by the Dirichlet integral:\n\n$$\\Gamma_s(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\varepsilon^s}{ \\prod_{i=1}^s \\nu_i } \\int_{\\sum u_i \\le 1, u_i \\ge 0} \\prod_{i=1}^s du_i$$\n\nThe integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{s!}$. Therefore, the total phase-space volume is:\n\n$$\\Gamma_s(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\varepsilon^s}{s! \\prod_{i=1}^s \\nu_i}$$\n\nThe classical sum of states is then:\n\n$$N(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\Gamma_s(\\varepsilon)}{h^s} = \\frac{\\varepsilon^s}{s! h^s \\prod_{i=1}^s \\nu_i} = \\frac{\\varepsilon^s}{s! \\prod_{i=1}^s (h\\nu_i)}$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the sum of states for $s$ classical harmonic oscillators. For the two transition states, the excess energies available to the bound modes are $\\varepsilon_1 = E - E_{01}$ and $\\varepsilon_2 = E - E_{02}$. Applying the derived formula:\n\nFor TS 1, with $s_1=3$ modes:\n$$N_1^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{01}) = \\frac{(E - E_{01})^{s_1}}{s_1! \\prod_{i=1}^{s_1} (h\\nu_i)} = \\frac{(E-E_{01})^3}{3! (h\\nu_1)(h\\nu_2)(h\\nu_3)}$$\n\nFor TS 2, with $s_2=4$ modes:\n$$N_2^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{02}) = \\frac{(E - E_{02})^{s_2}}{s_2! \\prod_{j=1}^{s_2} (h\\tilde{\\nu}_j)} = \\frac{(E-E_{02})^4}{4! (h\\tilde{\\nu}_1)(h\\tilde{\\nu}_2)(h\\tilde{\\nu}_3)(h\\tilde{\\nu}_4)}$$\n\n**Part 2: Branching Fraction, $b_1(E)$**\n\nThe RRKM microcanonical rate constant for a specific channel $i$ is given by:\n$$k_i(E) = \\frac{N_i^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{0i})}{h \\rho(E)}$$\nwhere $N_i^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{0i})$ is the sum of states of the transition state for channel $i$, and $\\rho(E)$ is the density of states of the energized reactant molecule.\n\nThe branching fraction into channel $1$, $b_1(E)$, is the ratio of the rate of channel $1$ to the total rate of reaction, which is the sum of the rates of all competing channels.\n$$b_1(E) = \\frac{k_1(E)}{k_1(E) + k_2(E)}$$\n\nSubstituting the RRKM expressions for the rate constants:\n$$b_1(E) = \\frac{ \\frac{N_1^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{01})}{h \\rho(E)} }{ \\frac{N_1^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{01})}{h \\rho(E)} + \\frac{N_2^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{02})}{h \\rho(E)} }$$\n\nThe term $h \\rho(E)$, which depends on the properties of the common reactant, cancels from the numerator and denominator. This shows that the branching fraction depends only on the properties of the competing transition states.\n$$b_1(E) = \\frac{N_1^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{01})}{N_1^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{01}) + N_2^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{02})}$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation of $b_1(E)$**\n\nFirst, convert all molar energies to molecular energies using Avogadro's constant, $N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$.\n$$E_{per \\ molecule} = \\frac{E_{per \\ mole}}{N_A}$$\nGiven values:\n$E = 150 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$, $E_{01} = 70 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$, $E_{02} = 60 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\nThe excess energies are:\n$\\varepsilon_1 = E - E_{01} = (150 - 70) \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}} = 80 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}} = \\frac{80 \\times 10^3}{N_A} \\ \\mathrm{J}$\n$\\varepsilon_2 = E - E_{02} = (150 - 60) \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}} = 90 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}} = \\frac{90 \\times 10^3}{N_A} \\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\nThe expression for the branching fraction can be rewritten as:\n$$b_1(E) = \\left( 1 + \\frac{N_2^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{02})}{N_1^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{01})} \\right)^{-1}$$\nLet's compute the ratio $R = \\frac{N_2^{\\ddagger}}{N_1^{\\ddagger}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{(E - E_{02})^{s_2}}{s_2! \\prod_{j=1}^{s_2} (h\\tilde{\\nu}_j)}}{\\frac{(E - E_{01})^{s_1}}{s_1! \\prod_{i=1}^{s_1} (h\\nu_i)}} = \\frac{s_1!}{s_2!} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{s_1} \\nu_i}{\\prod_{j=1}^{s_2} \\tilde{\\nu}_j} h^{s_1-s_2} \\frac{(E - E_{02})^{s_2}}{(E - E_{01})^{s_1}}$$\nGiven $s_1=3$ and $s_2=4$, and converting molar energies to molecular energies:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{\\prod \\nu_i}{\\prod \\tilde{\\nu}_j} \\frac{1}{hN_A} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{2,mol}^4}{\\varepsilon_{1,mol}^3}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n- Frequency products:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^3 \\nu_i = (12 \\times 10^{12}) (18 \\times 10^{12}) (25 \\times 10^{12}) = 5.4 \\times 10^{39} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-3}}$\n$\\prod_{j=1}^4 \\tilde{\\nu}_j = (8 \\times 10^{12}) (10 \\times 10^{12}) (14 \\times 10^{12}) (20 \\times 10^{12}) = 2.24 \\times 10^{52} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-4}}$\n\n- Molar energy ratio:\n$\\frac{\\varepsilon_{2,mol}^4}{\\varepsilon_{1,mol}^3} = \\frac{(90 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}})^4}{(80 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}})^3} = \\frac{9^4 \\times 10^{16}}{8^3 \\times 10^{12}} \\frac{(\\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}})^4}{(\\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}})^3} = \\frac{6561}{512} \\times 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}} \\approx 1.281445 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}}$\n\n- Constant product:\n$hN_A = (6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ s}) (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) \\approx 3.99031 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ s \\ mol^{-1}}$\n\nNow assemble the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{5.4 \\times 10^{39} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-3}}}{2.24 \\times 10^{52} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-4}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{3.99031 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ s \\ mol^{-1}}} \\right) \\left( 1.281445 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}} \\right)$$\n$$R = 0.25 \\times (2.41071 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times (2.50607 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{J^{-1} \\ s^{-1} \\ mol}) \\times (1.281445 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1}})$$\n$$R = 0.25 \\times (2.41071 \\times 2.50607 \\times 1.281445) \\times 10^{-13+9+5}$$\n$$R = 0.25 \\times 7.74106 \\times 10^1 = 19.35265$$\n\nFinally, calculate the branching fraction $b_1(E)$:\n$$b_1(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + R} = \\frac{1}{1 + 19.35265} = \\frac{1}{20.35265} \\approx 0.0491338$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives $0.04913$.\nThe channel with the lower barrier ($E_{02} = 60 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$) and more degrees of freedom ($s_2=4$) is strongly favored, leading to a small branching fraction for channel $1$.
