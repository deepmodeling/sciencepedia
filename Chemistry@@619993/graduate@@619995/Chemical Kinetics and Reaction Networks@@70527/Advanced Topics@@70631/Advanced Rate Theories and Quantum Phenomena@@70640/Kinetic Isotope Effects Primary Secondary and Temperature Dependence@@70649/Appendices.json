According to TST, the rate constant $k$ for a unimolecular reaction is given by:\n$$k = \\frac{k_{B}T}{h} \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{R}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $h$ is the Planck constant, $Q_{R}$ is the total partition function of the reactant, $Q^{\\ddagger}$ is the total partition function of the transition state with the mode corresponding to the reaction coordinate excluded, and $E_{c}$ is the classical potential energy barrier height.\n\nThe KIE is the ratio of the rate constants for the two isotopologues:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{B}T}{h} \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{H}}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{H}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{\\frac{k_{B}T}{h} \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{D}}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{D}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{c}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}$$\nThe problem states that $E_{c}$ is identical for both isotopologues, so the exponential term and the pre-factor $\\frac{k_{B}T}{h}$ cancel:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{H}}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{H}}} \\frac{Q_{R,\\mathrm{D}}}{Q^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{D}}}$$\nThe total partition function $Q$ is a product of contributions from translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom. The problem specifies that only the listed vibrational modes contribute to the KIE, and all other contributions cancel. This is a significant simplification.

It presents a standard analysis of kinetic isotope effects (KIE) within the framework of Arrhenius theory and provides realistic parameters for a secondary inverse KIE. All necessary information for a unique solution is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its resolution.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the kinetic isotope effect, defined as the ratio of rate constants $k_{H}/k_{D}$, using the Arrhenius law. The Arrhenius equation for the protium-labeled substrate (H) is given by:\n$$k_{H} = A_{H} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,H}}{R T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_{H}$ is the rate constant, $A_{H}$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a,H}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSimilarly, for the deuterium-labeled substrate (D), the equation is:\n$$k_{D} = A_{D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,D}}{R T}\\right)$$\n\nThe kinetic isotope effect is the ratio of these two rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}} = \\frac{A_{H} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,H}}{R T}\\right)}{A_{D} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,D}}{R T}\\right)}$$\n\nThis expression can be simplified by combining the terms:\n$$\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{H}}{A_{D}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,H}}{R T} + \\frac{E_{a,D}}{R T}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common term in the exponential yields the desired expression:\n$$\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{H}}{A_{D}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}}{R T}\\right)$$\n\nThe second task is to evaluate this ratio at two specified temperatures, $T = 298~\\text{K}$ and $T = 350~\\text{K}$. The problem provides the following data:\n- Ratio of pre-exponential factors: $\\frac{A_{H}}{A_{D}} = 0.8$\n- Difference in activation energies: $E_{a,H} - E_{a,D} = 0.8~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1} = 800~\\text{cal mol}^{-1}$\n- Universal gas constant: $R = 1.9872~\\text{cal mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nAt $T = 298~\\text{K}$:\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$-\\frac{E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}}{R T} = -\\frac{800~\\text{cal mol}^{-1}}{(1.9872~\\text{cal mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (298~\\text{K})} \\approx -1.35103$$\nSubstituting this into the derived expression for the KIE:\n$$\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}} = (0.8) \\exp(-1.35103) \\approx (0.8) \\times (0.25898) \\approx 0.207184$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.2072$.\n\nAt $T = 350~\\text{K}$:\nThe argument of the exponential function is now:\n$$-\\frac{E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}}{R T} = -\\frac{800~\\text{cal mol}^{-1}}{(1.9872~\\text{cal mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (350~\\text{K})} \\approx -1.15020$$\nSubstituting this into the KIE expression:\n$$\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}} = (0.8) \\exp(-1.15020) \\approx (0.8) \\times (0.31658) \\approx 0.253264$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.2533$.\n\nThe final task is to provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed KIE and its temperature dependence. The kinetic isotope effect, $k_{H}/k_{D}$, is determined by two competing factors: the ratio of pre-exponential factors, $A_{H}/A_{D}$, and the exponential term containing the difference in activation energies, $\\exp(-\\frac{E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}}{R T})$.\n\nFrom Transition State Theory (TST), the Arrhenius activation energy $E_a$ is related to the enthalpy of activation $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$, and the pre-exponential factor $A$ is related to the entropy of activation $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$. The difference in activation energies, $E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}$, is dominated by the difference in zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE) between the reactant (R) and the transition state (TS). Specifically, $\\Delta E_{a} \\approx (\\text{ZPE}_{TS,H} - \\text{ZPE}_{TS,D}) - (\\text{ZPE}_{R,H} - \\text{ZPE}_{R,D})$. The provided value $E_{a,H} - E_{a,D} = 0.8~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}$ is positive. This means the ZPVE difference between H and D isotopologues is greater in the transition state than in the reactant. This occurs when the vibrational modes involving the substituted hydrogen become stiffer (higher frequency) upon proceeding from the reactant to the transition state. This enthalpic contribution, $\\exp(-\\frac{0.8~\\text{kcal mol}^{-1}}{RT})$, is less than $1$ and favors an inverse KIE ($k_{H} < k_{D}$).\n\nThe pre-exponential factor ratio, $A_{H}/A_{D} \\approx \\exp(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_{H} - \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_{D}}{R})$, reflects the entropic difference. The given value $A_{H}/A_{D} = 0.8$ is less than $1$, implying that $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_{H} < \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}_{D}$. This also points to a stiffening of vibrational modes in the transition state relative to the reactant for the H-compound, leading to a more ordered transition state and a less favorable entropy of activation. This entropic contribution also favors an inverse KIE.\n\nBoth the enthalpic and entropic terms promote an inverse KIE, resulting in the calculated values being significantly less than $1$.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the KIE is governed by the exponential term. Since $E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}$ is positive, as temperature $T$ increases, the magnitude of the negative exponent $-\\frac{E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}}{R T}$ decreases. Consequently, the value of $\\exp(-\\frac{E_{a,H} - E_{a,D}}{R T})$ increases, approaching $1$ at infinite temperature. This causes the overall KIE, $k_{H}/k_{D}$, to increase (become less inverse) with increasing temperature, as confirmed by our calculations ($0.2072$ at $298~\\text{K}$ versus $0.2533$ at $350~\\text{K}$).\n\nThe problem specifies that the isotopic substitution is at a position not involved in bond breaking in the rate-determining step. This defines the effect as a **secondary kinetic isotope effect**. Such an effect arises from changes in the vibrational environment of the C-H/C-D bond between the reactant and the transition state, as described above. A classic example is the change in hybridization of a carbon atom from $sp^2$ in the reactant to $sp^3$ in the transition state, which leads to a more sterically hindered environment and stiffens the out-of-plane bending modes.\n\nThe observed phenomena—a KIE explainable by ZPE changes, linear Arrhenius behavior (as implied by temperature-independent parameters), and a pre-exponential ratio $A_H/A_D$ close to unity—are all characteristic of a semi-classical KIE. There is no evidence for significant **quantum tunneling**, which would typically manifest as an anomalously large normal KIE ($k_{H}/k_{D} \\gg 1$), a strongly temperature-dependent $E_a$ (curved Arrhenius plot), and an $A_{H}/A_{D}$ ratio significantly different from $1$ (often $A_{H}/A_{D} \\ll 1$).

The KIE for two isotopes, $L_1$ and $L_2$, is the ratio of their rate constants, $\\frac{k_{L_1}}{k_{L_2}}$. The dominant contribution to the primary KIE in hydrogen transfer reactions arises from the difference in zero-point vibrational energies (ZPE) between the reactant and the transition state. The Born–Oppenheimer approximation implies that the potential energy surface is identical for all isotopes.\n\nIn the simplified semiclassical model, we consider only the stretching vibration of the bond being broken (e.g., $C-L$). In the reactant, this bond has a ZPE of $\\mathrm{ZPE}_L = \\frac{1}{2}N_A\\hbar\\omega_L$, where $\\omega_L$ is the vibrational frequency for isotope $L$. In the transition state, this vibrational mode becomes the reaction coordinate, a translational motion, and its contribution to the ZPE is considered to be zero. Other vibrational modes are assumed to have isotopic effects that are either negligible or cancel out.\nThe activation energy for isotope $L$ is $E_{a,L} = E_0 + (\\mathrm{ZPE}_{TS} - \\mathrm{ZPE}_{R})_L$, where $E_0$ is the classical barrier height. The difference in activation energy between two isotopes $L_1$ and $L_2$ is thus predominantly due to the difference in the reactant ZPEs:\n$$E_{a,L_1} - E_{a,L_2} \\approx \\mathrm{ZPE}_{R,L_2} - \\mathrm{ZPE}_{R,L_1}$$\nAssuming the ratio of pre-exponential factors (including tunneling corrections, $\\kappa$) is unity, the KIE is given by:\n$$\\frac{k_{L_1}}{k_{L_2}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,L_1} - E_{a,L_2}}{RT}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ZPE}_{R,L_1} - \\mathrm{ZPE}_{R,L_2}}{RT}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the harmonic oscillator ZPE expression:\n$$\\frac{k_{L_1}}{k_{L_2}} \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{N_A\\hbar}{2RT}(\\omega_{L_1} - \\omega_{L_2})\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm, we find:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{L_1}}{k_{L_2}}\\right) \\approx \\frac{N_A\\hbar}{2RT}(\\omega_{L_1} - \\omega_{L_2})$$\nThe problem states that the vibrational frequency scales with the reduced mass $\\mu$ as $\\omega \\propto \\mu^{-1/2}$.

Using the definition of $n$ and the proportionality $\\ln(k_{L_1}/k_{L_2}) \\propto (m_{L_1}^{-1/2} - m_{L_2}^{-1/2})$, we have:\n$$n_{s.c.} = \\frac{\\ln(k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{T}})}{\\ln(k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}})} = \\frac{C(m_{\\mathrm{H}}^{-1/2} - m_{\\mathrm{T}}^{-1/2})}{C(m_{\\mathrm{H}}^{-1/2} - m_{\\mathrm{D}}^{-1/2})} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{H}}^{-1/2} - m_{\\mathrm{T}}^{-1/2}}{m_{\\mathrm{H}}^{-1/2} - m_{\\mathrm{D}}^{-1/2}}$$\nUsing the integer mass approximation $m_{\\mathrm{H}}:m_{\\mathrm{D}}:m_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1:2:3$:\n$$n_{s.c.} = \\frac{1^{-1/2} - 3^{-1/2}}{1^{-1/2} - 2^{-1/2}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.57735}{1 - 0.70711} = \\frac{0.42265}{0.29289} \\approx 1.443$$\nA comparison between the experimental value $n_{exp} \\approx 1.370$ and the semiclassical prediction $n_{s.c.} \\approx 1.443$ reveals a significant discrepancy. The experimental value is lower than the theoretical one. This deviation, $n_{exp} < n_{s.c.}$, is a classic signature of quantum mechanical tunneling. The semiclassical model neglects tunneling, which is the non-classical passage of a particle through a potential energy barrier. Tunneling is highly mass-dependent, being far more probable for the light proton ($\\mathrm{H}$) than for the heavier deuteron ($\\mathrm{D}$) or triton ($\\mathrm{T}$). This leads to a tunneling correction factor $\\kappa_L$ where $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}} > \\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}} > \\kappa_{\\mathrm{T}} > 1$. The inclusion of tunneling enhances the KIEs beyond the ZPE effect, and it has been shown to lower the Swain–Schaad exponent below the semiclassical limit of approximately $1.44$. Therefore, the fact that the measured exponent is less than the semiclassical prediction strongly suggests that quantum tunneling is a significant contributing factor in this hydrogen-transfer reaction.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the Swain–Schaad exponent computed from the data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.370}$$", "id": "2650239"}]}
