No rounding is required.", "solution": "The analysis is performed in two parts as required. First, we analyze the initial network, and second, the network after the addition of the inflow-outflow reactions.\n\nPart 1: Analysis of the initial network.\nThe species of the network are $\\{A, B, C\\}$. The vector space of species concentrations is $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, with basis vectors corresponding to $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nThe reactions are $R_1: B \\to A+B$ and $R_2: A+C \\to C$.\n\nTo determine the deficiency $\\delta = n - l - s$, we must first compute the number of complexes $n$, the number of linkage classes $l$, and the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace $s$.\n\nThe set of complexes, $\\mathcal{C}$, consists of the unique linear combinations of species appearing as reactants or products.\nFrom $R_1$, we have complexes $B$ and $A+B$.\nFrom $R_2$, we have complexes $A+C$ and $C$.\nThe complete set of distinct complexes is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{B, A+B, A+C, C\\}$.\nThe number of complexes is thus $n = |\\mathcal{C}| = 4$.\n\nThe linkage classes are the connected components of the reaction graph, where complexes are vertices and reactions are edges. The given reactions define the directed edges $B \\to A+B$ and $A+C \\to C$.\nThe underlying undirected graph has two disjoint components: one connecting $B$ and $A+B$, and another connecting $A+C$ and $C$.\nThe linkage classes are $\\{B, A+B\\}$ and $\\{A+C, C\\}$.\nThe number of linkage classes is therefore $l=2$.\n\nTo find the stoichiometric subspace $S$, we must first represent the complexes as vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let the basis be $(A, B, C)$.\nThe complex vectors are:\n$y_B = (0, 1, 0)^T$\n$y_{A+B} = (1, 1, 0)^T$\n$y_{A+C} = (1, 0, 1)^T$\n$y_C = (0, 0, 1)^T$\n\nThe reaction vectors are the differences between product and reactant complex vectors.\nFor $R_1: B \\to A+B$, the vector is $v_1 = y_{A+B} - y_B = (1, 1, 0)^T - (0, 1, 0)^T = (1, 0, 0)^T$.\nFor $R_2: A+C \\to C$, the vector is $v_2 = y_C - y_{A+C} = (0, 0, 1)^T - (1, 0, 1)^T = (-1, 0, 0)^T$.\nThe stoichiometric subspace $S$ is the span of these reaction vectors: $S = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2\\} = \\text{span}\\{(1, 0, 0)^T, (-1, 0, 0)^T\\}$.\nSince $v_2 = -1 \\cdot v_1$, these vectors are linearly dependent. A basis for $S$ is simply $\\{(1, 0, 0)^T\\}$.\nThe dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s = \\dim(S) = 1$.\n\nThe problem demands justification of whether species $A$ is both produced and consumed. The reaction vector $v_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T$ has a positive first component, indicating net production of $A$. The reaction vector $v_2 = (-1, 0, 0)^T$ has a negative first component, indicating net consumption of $A$. Thus, species $A$ is both produced and consumed by the network.\n\nThe deficiency of the initial network, which we denote $\\delta_{\\mathrm{before}}$, is:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{before}} = n - l - s = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$\n\nPart 2: Analysis of the augmented network.\nWe add the reversible reaction pair $0 \\rightleftharpoons A$, which consists of two elementary reactions: $R_3: 0 \\to A$ and $R_4: A \\to 0$. Here, $0$ represents the zero complex, corresponding to the vector $(0, 0, 0)^T$.\n\nWe re-evaluate $n$, $l$, and $s$ for the new network and explain the changes.\nThe new set of complexes $\\mathcal{C}'$ includes the original four complexes plus the two new ones from the added reactions: $0$ and $A$.\n$\\mathcal{C}' = \\{B, A+B, A+C, C, 0, A\\}$.\nThe number of complexes becomes $n_{\\mathrm{after}} = 6$. The value $n$ increases by $2$ because the added reactions involve two complexes, $0$ and $A$, neither of which was present in the original set of complexes $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe new reaction graph includes the original two linkage classes plus a new one corresponding to the reaction pair $0 \\rightleftharpoons A$. The new complexes $0$ and $A$ are not identical to any of the original complexes, so the new reaction edge $0 \\leftrightarrow A$ does not merge any existing linkage classes. It forms a new, separate connected component $\\{0, A\\}$.\nThe linkage classes are now $\\{B, A+B\\}$, $\\{A+C, C\\}$, and $\\{0, A\\}$.\nThe number of linkage classes is $l_{\\mathrm{after}} = 3$. The value of $l$ increases by $1$ because the two new complexes introduced are not connected to any of the old ones, thus forming their own linkage class.\n\nThe new stoichiometric subspace $S_{\\mathrm{after}}$ is spanned by the original reaction vectors and the vectors from the new reactions.\nThe reaction vector for $R_3: 0 \\to A$ is $v_3 = y_A - y_0 = (1, 0, 0)^T - (0, 0, 0)^T = (1, 0, 0)^T$.\nThe reaction vector for $R_4: A \\to 0$ is $v_4 = y_0 - y_A = (0, 0, 0)^T - (1, 0, 0)^T = (-1, 0, 0)^T$.\nThe new subspace is $S_{\\mathrm{after}} = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\} = \\text{span}\\{(1, 0, 0)^T, (-1, 0, 0)^T, (1, 0, 0)^T, (-1, 0, 0)^T\\}$.\nThis is still $\\text{span}\\{(1, 0, 0)^T\\}$.\nThe dimension remains $s_{\\mathrm{after}} = 1$.\nThe dimension $s$ does not change in this particular network for a precise reason. In this network, the production and consumption of species $A$ are \"pure\". The reaction vector for production is $v_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T = e_A$ and for consumption is $v_2 = (-1, 0, 0)^T = -e_A$, where $e_A$ is the standard basis vector for species $A$. Therefore, the original stoichiometric subspace is $S_{\\mathrm{before}} = \\text{span}\\{e_A, -e_A\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_A\\}$. The new reactions $0 \\rightleftharpoons A$ add the vectors $e_A$ and $-e_A$ to the spanning set of the stoichiometric subspace. Since these vectors are already in $S_{\\mathrm{before}}$ (in fact, they are its generators), the subspace itself does not change: $S_{\\mathrm{after}} = \\text{span}(S_{\\mathrm{before}} \\cup \\{e_A, -e_A\\}) = S_{\\mathrm{before}}$. Consequently, the dimension $s$ remains unchanged. It must be noted this is not a general consequence of a species being produced and consumed, but a specific feature of this network's stoichiometry.\n\nPart 3: Change in deficiency.\nThe deficiency of the augmented network, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{after}}$, is:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{after}} = n_{\\mathrm{after}} - l_{\\mathrm{after}} - s_{\\mathrm{after}} = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2.\n$$\nThe change in deficiency is calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{after}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{before}} = 2 - 1 = 1.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2684627"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of the Deficiency One Theorem is to predict a network's capacity for complex behaviors like bistability.

The species are $A$ and $B$.\n\n**1. Network Deficiency Calculation ($\\delta = n - l - s$)**\n\nFirst, we identify the set of complexes, $\\mathcal{C}$. A complex is any distinct entity appearing as a reactant or a product.\nThe complexes are: $A$, $B$, $2A$, $A+B$, and the zero complex $0$.\nThe set of complexes is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{A, B, 2A, A+B, 0\\}$.\nThe number of complexes is $n = 5$.\n\nNext, we identify the linkage classes. A linkage class is a connected component of the reaction graph, where complexes are vertices and reactions are edges.\nThe reactions establish the following connections:\n$A \\leftrightarrow B$ due to $R_1$ and $R_2$.\n$B \\leftrightarrow 0$ due to $R_5$.\n$2A \\leftrightarrow A+B$ due to $R_3$ and $R_4$.\nFrom these connections, we can trace the linkage classes:\n- $A$ is connected to $B$, which is connected to $0$. This forms the first linkage class $L_1 = \\{A, B, 0\\}$.\n- $2A$ is connected to $A+B$. There are no connections between $\\{A, B, 0\\}$ and $\\{2A, A+B\\}$. This forms the second linkage class $L_2 = \\{2A, A+B\\}$.\nThe number of linkage classes is $l = 2$.\n\nFinally, we determine the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$. The species space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with basis vectors corresponding to species $A$ and $B$. The complexes are represented as vectors in this space:\n$y_A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $y_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $y_{2A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $y_{A+B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $y_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe reaction vectors are the differences between product and reactant complex vectors:\n$y_B - y_A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$y_{A+B} - y_{2A} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$y_A - y_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$y_{2A} - y_{A+B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$y_0 - y_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe stoichiometric subspace $S$ is the span of these vectors:\n$S = \\text{span} \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} = \\text{span} \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$.\nThe two vectors in the basis are linearly independent. Thus, the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s = 2$.\n\nThe network deficiency $\\delta$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\delta = n - l - s = 5 - 2 - 2 = 1 $$\nThe network has deficiency one, so the deficiency one algorithm is applicable.\n\n**2. Linkage Class Structure Analysis**\n\nWe analyze the structure of each linkage class in terms of its strong components (strong linkage classes).\n- **Linkage Class $L_1 = \\{A, B, 0\\}$**: The reactions define a directed path $A \\leftrightarrow B \\to 0$. A directed path exists from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $A$, so $\\{A, B\\}$ forms a strong linkage class. A path exists from $B$ to $0$, but not from $0$ to $B$. Thus, $\\{0\\}$ is a separate strong linkage class. The strong linkage classes of $L_1$ are $\\mathcal{S}_{1,1} = \\{A, B\\}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{1,2} = \\{0\\}$.\nA strong linkage class is terminal if no reaction originates in it and ends in a different strong linkage class.\n$\\mathcal{S}_{1,1}$ is not terminal because the reaction $B \\to 0$ originates in $\\mathcal{S}_{1,1}$ and terminates in $\\mathcal{S}_{1,2}$.\n$\\mathcal{S}_{1,2}$ is terminal because no reaction originates from the zero complex.\n- **Linkage Class $L_2 = \\{2A, A+B\\}$**: The reactions are $2A \\rightleftharpoons A+B$. A directed path exists in both directions, so the entire linkage class is a single strong linkage class, $\\mathcal{S}_{2,1} = \\{2A, A+B\\}$. By definition, a linkage class that is also a strong linkage class is terminal.\n\n**3. Application of the Deficiency One Algorithm**\n\nThe deficiency one theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a deficiency-one network to admit multiple positive steady states. The possibility of multiple steady states is contingent on a structural condition.\nA necessary condition for a deficiency-one network to exhibit multiple steady states is that there must exist at least one linkage class which is not strongly linked, and for such a linkage class, the set of reaction vectors connecting its distinct strong components must be linearly dependent.\n\nIn our network, linkage class $L_2$ is strongly linked. Linkage class $L_1$ is not strongly linked; it has two strong components, $\\mathcal{S}_{1,1}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{1,2}$. We must examine the reaction vectors connecting these components.\nThe only reaction connecting the two strong components is $B \\to 0$, where $B \\in \\mathcal{S}_{1,1}$ and $0 \\in \\mathcal{S}_{1,2}$.\nThe corresponding reaction vector is $v = y_0 - y_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe set of such reaction vectors connecting the strong components of $L_1$ is $V_1 = \\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\}$.\n\nFor multiple steady states to be possible, this set $V_1$ must be linearly dependent. A set containing a single non-zero vector is, by definition, linearly independent.\nTherefore, the necessary structural condition of the deficiency one algorithm is not satisfied. The algorithm certifies that this network **cannot** admit multiple positive steady states for any choice of strictly positive rate constants.\n\n**4. Reconciliation with Steady-State Equations**\n\nWe verify this conclusion by examining the system of ordinary differential equations for the species concentrations, denoted $x_A = [A]$ and $x_B = [B]$, under mass-action kinetics.\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{dt} = -k_1 x_A + k_2 x_B - k_3 x_A^2 + k_4 x_A x_B $$\n$$ \\frac{dx_B}{dt} = k_1 x_A - k_2 x_B + k_3 x_A^2 - k_4 x_A x_B - k_5 x_B $$\nA steady state is a solution where $\\frac{dx_A}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dx_B}{dt} = 0$.\nLet the expression $Z(x_A, x_B) = k_1 x_A - k_2 x_B + k_3 x_A^2 - k_4 x_A x_B$.\nThe steady-state equations are:\n1) $-Z(x_A, x_B) = 0 \\implies Z(x_A, x_B) = 0$\n2) $Z(x_A, x_B) - k_5 x_B = 0$\n\nSubstituting the result from equation (1) into equation (2), we obtain:\n$$ 0 - k_5 x_B = 0 \\implies -k_5 x_B = 0 $$\nSince the rate constant $k_5$ is strictly positive ($k_5 > 0$), this equation requires that $x_B = 0$.\n\nA positive steady state is defined as a steady state where all concentrations are strictly positive, i.e., $x_A > 0$ and $x_B > 0$. Our finding that any steady state must have $x_B = 0$ directly contradicts this requirement.\nThus, no positive steady states exist for this network.\n\nIf no positive steady states exist, it is a logical consequence that it is not possible to have more than one. This direct analysis confirms the conclusion from the deficiency one algorithm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe network's structure fails the necessary conditions of the deficiency one algorithm for admitting multiple positive steady states. An independent algebraic analysis of the steady-state equations shows that no positive steady states exist at all. Therefore, the network cannot admit more than one positive steady state.\nThe indicator $S$, which is $1$ if multiple positive steady states are possible and $0$ otherwise, must be $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2684622"}]}
