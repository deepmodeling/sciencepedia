The set of chemical species is $\\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$. The set of reactions is specified as $A \\to B$, $B \\to C$, $C \\to B$, $D \\to E$, and $E \\to D$. A linkage class is defined as a connected component of the underlying undirected version of the reaction graph on complexes. The objective is to determine the number of linkage classes, denoted by $\\ell$.\n\nNext, the problem is validated against the required criteria. The problem is scientifically grounded within the established discipline of Chemical Reaction Network Theory. Its concepts, such as species, complexes, and linkage classes, are standard and well-defined. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. It presents a clear, unambiguous task with all necessary information provided. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or violations of scientific principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a rigorous solution is attainable.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the definition of a linkage class. This requires three steps: first, identifying the set of unique complexes from the reactions; second, constructing the reaction graph; and third, determining the number of connected components of the underlying undirected graph.\n\nStep 1: Identification of Complexes.\nA complex is a formal linear combination of species that appears as a reactant or a product in a reaction. In this network, the species appear individually. We inspect each reaction:\n- From $A \\to B$, the complexes are $A$ and $B$.\n- From $B \\to C$, the complexes are $B$ and $C$.\n- From $C \\to B$, the complexes are $C$ and $B$. These are already listed.\n- From $D \\to E$, the complexes are $D$ and $E$.\n- From $E \\to D$, the complexes are $E$ and $D$. These are also already listed.\n\nThe set of unique complexes, which we shall denote by $\\mathcal{C}$, is the set of vertices for our graph. Thus, $\\mathcal{C} = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$.\n\nStep 2: Construction of the Reaction Graph.\nThe reaction graph is a directed graph where the vertices are the complexes in $\\mathcal{C}$ and the directed edges represent the reactions. Based on the given reactions, the directed edges are:\n- $A \\to B$\n- $B \\to C$\n- $C \\to B$\n- $D \\to E$\n- $E \\to D$\n\nStep 3: Determination of Linkage Classes.\nA linkage class is a connected component of the underlying undirected graph. To find these, we disregard the directionality of the edges. An undirected edge exists between two complexes if there is a reaction connecting them in either direction.\nThe set of undirected connections is as follows:\n- The reaction $A \\to B$ creates a connection between $A$ and $B$.\n- The reactions $B \\to C$ and $C \\to B$ create a connection between $B$ and $C$.\n- The reactions $D \\to E$ and $E \\to D$ create a connection between $D$ and $E$.\n\nWe now analyze the connectivity of the graph with these undirected edges.\n- Complex $A$ is connected to $B$. Complex $B$ is connected to $C$. By transitivity, a path exists between any pair of complexes in the set $\\{A, B, C\\}$. Therefore, $\\{A, B, C\\}$ forms a single connected component. This is the first linkage class.\n- Complex $D$ is connected to $E$. These two complexes form a second connected component, $\\{D, E\\}$. This is the second linkage class.\n- There are no reactions connecting any complex from $\\{A, B, C\\}$ to any complex from $\\{D, E\\}$. Consequently, these two components are disjoint.\n\nThe graph of complexes is partitioned into two distinct connected components. The number of linkage classes, $\\ell$, is precisely the number of these components. Therefore, the number of linkage classes is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2653273"}, {"introduction": "Chemical Reaction Network Theory provides powerful connections between a network's topology and its algebraic properties.

It is a standard exercise in Chemical Reaction Network Theory based on established definitions and principles. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe reaction network is given as a sequence of unimolecular, irreversible reactions: $$A \\to B \\to C \\to D.$$\nThe set of chemical complexes, denoted by $\\mathcal{C}$, consists of the distinct entities appearing as either reactants or products in the reactions. From the network structure, the set of complexes is $$\\mathcal{C} = \\{A, B, C, D\\}.$$ The number of complexes is the cardinality of this set, so we have $n = |\\mathcal{C}| = 4$.\n\nThe next step is to determine the number of linkage classes, denoted by $\\ell$. A linkage class is a connected component of the complex graph. The vertices of the complex graph are the complexes themselves. The edges of the graph connect any two complexes that are joined by a reaction, irrespective of the reaction direction. In this case, the reactions are $A \\to B$, $B \\to C$, and $C \\to D$. These reactions induce undirected edges $(A, B)$, $(B, C)$, and $(C, D)$ in the complex graph. The resulting graph is a path graph:\n$$A - B - C - D$$\nThis graph is fully connected; all vertices belong to a single connected component. Therefore, there is only one linkage class. The number of linkage classes is $\\ell = 1$.\n\nWe are now required to compute the complex incidence matrix, $B$. This matrix has one row for each complex and one column for each reaction. The problem specifies the ordering of rows (complexes) as $(A, B, C, D)$ and the ordering of columns (reactions) as $(A \\to B, B \\to C, C \\to D)$. The dimensions of $B$ are $n \\times r$, where $n=4$ is the number of complexes and $r=3$ is the number of reactions. For each reaction (column), the entry corresponding to the source complex is $-1$, the entry for the product complex is $+1$, and all other entries are $0$.\n\nFor the first reaction, $R_1: A \\to B$:\nThe source complex is $A$ (row $1$) and the product complex is $B$ (row $2$). The first column of $B$ is therefore $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nFor the second reaction, $R_2: B \\to C$:\nThe source complex is $B$ (row $2$) and the product complex is $C$ (row $3$). The second column of $B$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nFor the third reaction, $R_3: C \\to D$:\nThe source complex is $C$ (row $3$) and the product complex is $D$ (row $4$). The third column of $B$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nCombining these columns, the complex incidence matrix $B$ is:\n$$B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe next task is to compute the rank of this matrix, $\\operatorname{rank}(B)$. The rank is the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). Let the column vectors be $v_1, v_2, v_3$. We check for linear independence by solving the equation $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = \\mathbf{0}$ for scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$.\n$$c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c_3 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis vector equation is equivalent to the system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n-c_1 &= 0 \\\\\nc_1 - c_2 &= 0 \\\\\nc_2 - c_3 &= 0 \\\\\nc_3 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the first and last equations, we immediately find $c_1 = 0$ and $c_3 = 0$. Substituting these into the other equations confirms that $c_2 = 0$. Since the only solution is the trivial one, $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0$, the column vectors are linearly independent. The number of linearly independent columns is $3$. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is $\\operatorname{rank}(B) = 3$.\n\nFinally, we must verify the connectivityâ€“incidence relation, which states that $\\operatorname{rank}(B) = n - \\ell$.\nWe have computed:\n- $\\operatorname{rank}(B) = 3$\n- $n = 4$\n- $\\ell = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the relation:\n$$n - \\ell = 4 - 1 = 3$$\nThis confirms that $\\operatorname{rank}(B) = n - \\ell$, since $3 = 3$. The verification is successful.\n\nThe problem asks for a final row matrix containing the values for $\\operatorname{rank}(B)$, $n$, $\\ell$, and $n-\\ell$ in that specific order.\nThe values are:\n- $\\operatorname{rank}(B) = 3$\n- $n = 4$\n- $\\ell = 1$\n- $n - \\ell = 3$\n\nThe resulting sequence of values is $(3, 4, 1, 3)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2653405"}, {"introduction": "A deeper understanding of network structure requires distinguishing between different levels of connectivity.
