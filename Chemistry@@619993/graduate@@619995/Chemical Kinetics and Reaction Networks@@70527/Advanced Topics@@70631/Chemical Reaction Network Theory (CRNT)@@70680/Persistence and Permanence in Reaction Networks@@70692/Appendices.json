A siphon is critical if it does not contain the support of any positive conservation law. The support of a vector $w=(w_A, w_B)^{\\top}$ is the set of species corresponding to its non-zero components.\nLet $\\mathcal{P}$ be a siphon. $\\mathcal{P}$ is critical if for every positive conservation law $w$, $\\text{supp}(w) \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$.\nSince the set of positive conservation laws for this network is empty, the condition \"for every positive conservation law $w$...\" is a quantification over an empty set.

The initial concentrations are $x(0) = x_0  0$ and $y(0) = y_0  0$.\n\nFirst, we address the identification of a minimal drainable siphon. A set of species $S$ is defined as a siphon if any reaction that produces a species in $S$ must also consume a species from $S$. This implies that if all species in a siphon are absent at some time $t_0$, they cannot be produced thereafter, and their concentrations remain zero.\nLet us examine the possible siphons in the network $\\{X, Y\\}$.\nThe species $X$ is not produced by any reaction. Therefore, the condition for a siphon is vacuously satisfied for any set containing $X$. The set $\\{X\\}$ is a siphon.\nThe species $Y$ is produced by reaction $R_1: X + Y \\to 2Y$. This reaction consumes species $Y$, which is an element of the set $\\{Y\\}$. Thus, $\\{Y\\}$ is a siphon.\nSince $\\{X\\}$ and $\\{Y\\}$ are singleton sets, they are minimal siphons. The set $\\{X, Y\\}$ is also a siphon, but it is not minimal as it contains smaller siphons.\n\nWe must identify a minimal siphon that is \"drainable.\" A siphon is drainable if there exist initial conditions for which the concentrations of all species in the siphon approach zero as time goes to infinity. We will demonstrate that the siphon $\\{Y\\}$ is drainable. To do this, we must analyze the system's dynamics, which also addresses the second task.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the concentrations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ under mass-action kinetics is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -k_1 x y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = k_1 x y - k_2 y = (k_1 x - k_2) y\n$$\nSince $x_0  0$ and $y_0  0$, the forward-invariant nature of the positive orthant ensures that $x(t)  0$ and $y(t)  0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nFrom the first ODE, $\\frac{dx}{dt}  0$, which signifies that $x(t)$ is a strictly decreasing function of time and converges to a limit $x_{\\infty} \\ge 0$.\n\nTo show that species $Y$ goes to extinction, we consider the sum of the concentrations, $S(t) = x(t) + y(t)$. Its time derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(x(t) + y(t)) = \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{dy}{dt} = (-k_1 x y) + (k_1 x y - k_2 y) = -k_2 y\n$$\nIntegrating this equation from $t=0$ to $t=T$ yields:\n$$\n(x(T) + y(T)) - (x(0) + y(0)) = -k_2 \\int_{0}^{T} y(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} y(\\tau) d\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_2} (x_0 + y_0 - x(T) - y(T))\n$$\nSince $x(T)  0$ and $y(T)  0$, we have $x(T) + y(T)  0$. Therefore, the integral is bounded above:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} y(\\tau) d\\tau  \\frac{x_0 + y_0}{k_2}\n$$\nAs this holds for any $T  0$, and the integrand $y(\\tau)$ is positive, the improper integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} y(\\tau) d\\tau$ must converge.\nThe function $y(t)$ is differentiable, and its derivative is $\\frac{dy}{dt} = (k_1 x - k_2) y$. Since $x(t)$ is bounded ($0  x(t) \\le x_0$) and $y(t)$ is also bounded ($0  y(t) \\le x_0 + y_0$), the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ is bounded. This implies that $y(t)$ is a uniformly continuous function on $[0, \\infty)$.\nBy Barbalat's Lemma, if a function $f(t)$ is uniformly continuous on $[0, \\infty)$ and its integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} f(t) dt$ converges, then $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} f(t) = 0$.\nApplying this lemma to $y(t)$, we conclude that $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t) = 0$. This proves that the species $Y$ becomes extinct for all strictly positive initial conditions.

The dynamics of the system dictate the choice of branch. The concentration of species $Y$ decreases to zero only when $k_1 x - k_2  0$, i.e., $x  k_2/k_1$. The system must evolve to a state where $x$ falls below this threshold. The final state $x_{\\infty}$ must therefore satisfy $x_{\\infty} \\le k_2/k_1$.
