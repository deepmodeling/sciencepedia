Each step will be executed with requisite formal rigor.\n\nLet the species be $A$ and $B$. The concentrations are denoted by $c_A$ and $c_B$. The species space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and we associate species $A$ with the vector $(1, 0)^T$ and species $B$ with $(0, 1)^T$.\n\n**1. Network Structure and Deficiency**\n\nFirst, we identify the fundamental components of the network.\nThe reactions are:\n$R_1: A \\xrightarrow{k_1} 0$\n$R_2: A \\xrightarrow{k_2} B$\n$R_3: B \\xrightarrow{k_3} 0$\n\nThe set of complexes, $\\mathcal{C}$, consists of the distinct chemical entities appearing as reactants or products.\nFrom the reactions, we identify the complexes as $A$, $B$, and the zero complex $0$.\nThus, the set of complexes is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{A, B, 0\\}$. The number of complexes is $m = 3$.\n\nThe composition vectors for these complexes are:\n$y_A = (1, 0)^T$\n$y_B = (0, 1)^T$\n$y_0 = (0, 0)^T$\n\nNext, we determine the linkage classes. A linkage class is a connected component of the graph where complexes are vertices and reactions are directed edges. The reactions $A \\to 0$ and $A \\to B$ connect complex $A$ to $0$ and $B$. The reaction $B \\to 0$ connects complex $B$ to $0$. The resulting graph structure is $B \\leftarrow A \\to 0$ and $B \\to 0$. All three complexes, $\\{A, B, 0\\}$, belong to a single connected component.\nTherefore, there is only one linkage class. The number of linkage classes is $l = 1$.\n\nNow, we determine the stoichiometric subspace, $S$. This is the vector subspace of the species space spanned by the reaction vectors. A reaction vector for a reaction $y_i \\to y_j$ is given by $y_j - y_i$.\nThe reaction vectors for this network are:\nFor $A \\xrightarrow{k_1} 0$: $v_1 = y_0 - y_A = (0, 0)^T - (1, 0)^T = (-1, 0)^T$.\nFor $A \\xrightarrow{k_2} B$: $v_2 = y_B - y_A = (0, 1)^T - (1, 0)^T = (-1, 1)^T$.\nFor $B \\xrightarrow{k_3} 0$: $v_3 = y_0 - y_B = (0, 0)^T - (0, 1)^T = (0, -1)^T$.\n\nThe stoichiometric subspace is $S = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\} = \\text{span}\\{(-1, 0)^T, (-1, 1)^T, (0, -1)^T\\}$.\nTo find the dimension of $S$, denoted by $s$, we find the rank of the matrix whose columns are the reaction vectors:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first two columns are linearly independent, as $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is $2$.\nThe dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s = 2$.\n\nThe network deficiency, $\\delta$, is defined as $\\delta = m - l - s$.\nSubstituting the values we have found:\n$\\delta = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\n**2. Weak Reversibility**\n\nA reaction network is defined as weakly reversible if every linkage class contains a directed cycle, or more formally, is a terminal strong linkage class. This implies that if there is a directed path of reactions from a complex $C_i$ to another complex $C_j$, there must also be a directed path from $C_j$ back to $C_i$.\n\nIn our network, the reactions are $A \\to B$, $A \\to 0$, and $B \\to 0$.\nThere is a path from $A$ to $B$ (via $A \\to B$). However, there is no path from $B$ to $A$.\nThere is a path from $A$ to $0$ (via $A \\to 0$). However, there is no path from $0$ to $A$.\nThere is a path from $B$ to $0$ (via $B \\to 0$). However, there is no path from $0$ to $B$.\n\nSince the single linkage class of this network is not a strong linkage class (it contains directed paths that cannot be reversed), the network is not weakly reversible.\n\n**3. Steady States and Complex-Balanced Equilibria**\n\nAssuming mass-action kinetics, the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the concentrations $c_A$ and $c_B$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dc_A}{dt} = -(k_1 + k_2)c_A\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dc_B}{dt} = k_2 c_A - k_3 c_B\n$$\nA steady state is a concentration vector $(c_A, c_B)^T$ for which the time derivatives are zero. We set the ODEs to zero:\n$-(k_1 + k_2)c_A = 0$\n$k_2 c_A - k_3 c_B = 0$\n\nFrom the first equation, since $k_1 > 0$ and $k_2 > 0$, it must be that $c_A = 0$.\nSubstituting $c_A = 0$ into the second equation gives $-k_3 c_B = 0$. Since $k_3 > 0$, it must be that $c_B = 0$.\nThe only steady state of the system is $(c_A, c_B)^T = (0, 0)^T$. Consequently, there are no positive steady states (where $c_i > 0$ for all $i$).\n\nNow we analyze the existence of a complex-balanced equilibrium (CBE). A state $\\vec{c}^*$ is a CBE if, for every complex $y \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the sum of rates of reactions producing $y$ is equal to the sum of rates of reactions consuming $y$.\nThe mass-action rates are $R_1 = k_1 c_A$, $R_2 = k_2 c_A$, $R_3 = k_3 c_B$.\nThe balance equations for each complex are:\n- For complex $A$: (formation) $0 = (k_1+k_2)c_A$ (consumption)\n- For complex $B$: (formation) $k_2 c_A = k_3 c_B$ (consumption)\n- For complex $0$: (formation) $k_1 c_A + k_3 c_B = 0$ (consumption)\n\nWe seek a positive solution $(c_A^*, c_B^*)^T$ with $c_A^* > 0$ and $c_B^* > 0$.\nFrom the balance equation for complex $A$, since $k_1+k_2>0$, we immediately obtain $c_A=0$.\nThis violates the condition for a positive equilibrium. Substituting $c_A = 0$ into the other equations yields $c_B = 0$. The only solution to the complex-balance-equations is the trivial equilibrium $(0, 0)^T$.\nTherefore, the network does not admit any positive complex-balanced equilibrium for any choice of positive rate constants $k_1, k_2, k_3$. This is consistent with our finding that it has no positive steady states, as any CBE must also be a steady state.\n\n**4. Conclusion on the Deficiency Zero Theorem**\n\nThe Deficiency Zero Theorem is a cornerstone of CRNT. It states that if a network is weakly reversible and has a deficiency of $\\delta=0$, then for any set of positive rate constants, it admits exactly one positive complex-balanced equilibrium within each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.\n\nOur analysis has shown that the given network has a deficiency $\\delta = 0$. However, it is not weakly reversible. We have also proven that it admits no positive complex-balanced equilibria.\n\nThe problem asks if this network is a counterexample to the implication “$\\delta = 0$ implies the existence of a complex-balanced equilibrium for all rate constants” in the absence of weak reversibility.\nThe answer is affirmative. This network demonstrates that the hypothesis of weak reversibility is essential for the conclusion of the Deficiency Zero Theorem. This network satisfies $\\delta=0$, but because it is not weakly reversible, the conclusion of the theorem does not hold. It is a standard example used to illustrate that deficiency zero, by itself, is insufficient to guarantee the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium. The network shows that the statement \"if $\\delta = 0$, then there exists a positive CBE\" is false for general reaction networks.\n\nThe final requested answer is the value of the network deficiency $\\delta$.

It states that if a network is weakly reversible and has a deficiency of $\\delta=0$, then for any set of positive rate constants, it admits exactly one positive complex-balanced equilibrium within each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.\n\nOur analysis has shown that the given network has a deficiency $\\delta = 0$. However, it is not weakly reversible. We have also proven that it admits no positive complex-balanced equilibria.\n\nThe problem asks if this network is a counterexample to the implication “$\\delta = 0$ implies the existence of a complex-balanced equilibrium for all rate constants” in the absence of weak reversibility.\nThe answer is affirmative. This network demonstrates that the hypothesis of weak reversibility is essential for the conclusion of the Deficiency Zero Theorem. This network satisfies $\\delta=0$, but because it is not weakly reversible, the conclusion of the theorem does not hold. It is a standard example used to illustrate that deficiency zero, by itself, is insufficient to guarantee the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium. The network shows that the statement \"if $\\delta = 0$, then there exists a positive CBE\" is false for general reaction networks.\n\nThe final requested answer is the value of the network deficiency $\\delta$. As computed in part 1, this value is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2658211"}]}
