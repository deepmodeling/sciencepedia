It presents a standard exercise in chemical reaction network theory, providing all necessary definitions and constraints for a unique and verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n(a) Construction of the Stoichiometric Matrix $N$.\nThe system involves $3$ species, ordered as $(A,B,C)$, and $5$ irreversible reactions ordered as ($R_{1}^{+}: A+B \\to C$, $R_{1}^{-}: C \\to A+B$, $R_{2}^{+}: C \\to B$, $R_{2}^{-}: B \\to C$, $R_{3}: B \\to A$). The stoichiometric matrix $N$ is an element of $\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 5}$, where the rows correspond to the species and the columns to the reactions. Each entry $N_{ij}$ is the net change in the amount of species $i$ due to reaction $j$, calculated as $N_{i j} = \\nu_{i j}^{\\text{prod}} - \\nu_{i j}^{\\text{reac}}$.\n\nWe construct the matrix column by column. Each column is a vector representing the net stoichiometric change for its corresponding reaction.\n\nFor a species vector $\\boldsymbol{x} = [x_A, x_B, x_C]^T$, the change vectors are:\n1.  Reaction $R_1^{+}: A + B \\to C$. The stoichiometric coefficients as reactants are $\\nu_{A,1}^{\\text{reac}} = 1$, $\\nu_{B,1}^{\\text{reac}} = 1$, $\\nu_{C,1}^{\\text{reac}} = 0$. The coefficients as products are $\\nu_{A,1}^{\\text{prod}} = 0$, $\\nu_{B,1}^{\\text{prod}} = 0$, $\\nu_{C,1}^{\\text{prod}} = 1$. The first column of $N$ is therefore $\\boldsymbol{n}_1 = [\\nu_{A,1}^{\\text{prod}}-\\nu_{A,1}^{\\text{reac}}, \\nu_{B,1}^{\\text{prod}}-\\nu_{B,1}^{\\text{reac}}, \\nu_{C,1}^{\\text{prod}}-\\nu_{C,1}^{\\text{reac}}]^T = [0-1, 0-1, 1-0]^T = [-1, -1, 1]^T$.\n\n2.

The second column is $\\boldsymbol{n}_2 = [1-0, 1-0, 0-1]^T = [1, 1, -1]^T$.\n\n3.  Reaction $R_2^{+}: C \\to B$. The coefficients are $\\nu_{A,3}^{\\text{reac}}=0$, $\\nu_{B,3}^{\\text{reac}}=0$, $\\nu_{C,3}^{\\text{reac}}=1$ and $\\nu_{A,3}^{\\text{prod}}=0$, $\\nu_{B,3}^{\\text{prod}}=1$, $\\nu_{C,3}^{\\text{prod}}=0$.

The fifth column is $\\boldsymbol{n}_5 = [1-0, 0-1, 0-0]^T = [1, -1, 0]^T$.\n\nCombining these column vectors, we obtain the stoichiometric matrix $N$:\n$$\nN = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n(b) Justification for Splitting Reversible Reactions.\nThe representation of reaction network dynamics as $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = N \\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is fundamentally based on the principle that each elementary process has a corresponding one-way flux, or rate, that is inherently non-negative. This is reflected in the structure of the rate vector $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x})$, where each component $v_j(\\boldsymbol{x})$ must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThe law of mass-action kinetics for an irreversible reaction $j$ is given by $v_j(\\boldsymbol{x}) = k_j \\prod_{i} x_i^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\text{reac}}}$. Since the rate constant $k_j$ and species concentrations $x_i$ are non-negative quantities, the resulting rate $v_j(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is also non-negative. Each $v_j(\\boldsymbol{x})$ represents the number of reaction events per unit time per unit volume, a quantity which cannot be negative.\n\nNow, consider a reversible reaction, for example, $A+B \\rightleftharpoons C$. This process is physically the result of two opposing elementary reactions: a forward reaction $A+B \\to C$ with rate $v^+ = k^+ x_A x_B$, and a backward reaction $C \\to A+B$ with rate $v^- = k^- x_C$. The *net rate* of conversion is $v_{net} = v^+ - v^- = k^+ x_A x_B - k^- x_C$.\n\nIf we attempted to represent this reversible reaction with a single column in the stoichiometric matrix, say $\\boldsymbol{n}_{net} = [-1, -1, 1]^T$ corresponding to the net consumption of $A$ and $B$ to produce $C$, the corresponding entry in the rate vector would have to be $v_{net}$. However, the sign of $v_{net}$ depends on the relative magnitudes of $v^+$ and $v^-$, which in turn depend on the species concentrations. The value $v_{net}$ can be positive, negative, or zero. A negative value for a component of the rate vector $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ would violate the fundamental premise of the model, which interprets $v_j$ as a non-negative one-way flux. The signs, indicating the direction of species change, are meant to be encoded exclusively within the stoichiometric matrix $N$, not in the rate vector $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x})$.\n\nSplitting the reversible reaction into two irreversible steps resolves this contradiction. We define two separate reactions, $R_1^+: A+B \\to C$ and $R_1^-: C \\to A+B$. Their corresponding rates, $v_1^+(\\boldsymbol{x}) = k_1^+ x_A x_B$ and $v_1^-(\\boldsymbol{x}) = k_1^- x_C$, are both non-negative. The stoichiometric vectors are $\\boldsymbol{n}_{1} = [-1, -1, 1]^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_{2} = [1, 1, -1]^T = -\\boldsymbol{n}_1$. The total contribution of this reaction pair to the system dynamics is $\\boldsymbol{n}_1 v_1^+(\\boldsymbol{x}) + \\boldsymbol{n}_2 v_1^-(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{n}_1 v_1^+(\\boldsymbol{x}) - \\boldsymbol{n}_1 v_1^-(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{n}_1(v_1^+(\\boldsymbol{x}) - v_1^-(\\boldsymbol{x})) = \\boldsymbol{n}_1 v_{net}(\\boldsymbol{x})$. This formulation correctly captures the net chemical change while preserving the componentwise non-negativity of the rate vector $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = [v_1^+, v_1^-, \\dots]^T$. This ensures that the mathematical framework is consistent with the physical interpretation of reaction rates as non-negative fluxes.\n\n(c) Computation of the Dimension of the Right Nullspace of $N$.\nThe dimension of the right nullspace of $N$, denoted $\\dim(\\ker N)$, is also known as the nullity of $N$. According to the rank-nullity theorem, for a matrix with $m$ columns, its rank and nullity sum to $m$: $\\text{rank}(N) + \\dim(\\ker N) = m$.\nIn our case, the matrix $N$ has $m=5$ columns. Thus, $\\dim(\\ker N) = 5 - \\text{rank}(N)$. To find $\\dim(\\ker N)$, we must first compute the rank of $N$. We can do this by reducing $N$ to its row echelon form using Gaussian elimination.\n\nThe matrix is:\n$$\nN = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet the rows be $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.\nStep 1: Perform the operation $R_2 \\leftarrow R_2 - R_1$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nStep 2: Perform the operation $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 + R_1$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nStep 3: Perform the operation $R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 + R_2$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix is now in row echelon form. We can identify the number of non-zero rows, which is equal to the rank of the matrix. There are $3$ non-zero rows. Therefore, $\\text{rank}(N) = 3$.\n\nUsing the rank-nullity theorem, we find the dimension of the kernel:\n$$\n\\dim(\\ker N) = 5 - \\text{rank}(N) = 5 - 3 = 2\n$$\nThe dimension of the right nullspace of the stoichiometric matrix $N$ is $2$. These nullspace vectors correspond to steady-state flux vectors $\\boldsymbol{v}_{ss}$ for which $N\\boldsymbol{v}_{ss} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, meaning the net production of all species is zero. The two basis vectors of this nullspace correspond to the two reversible reaction pairs, $R_1$ and $R_2$, operating at a net zero flux (i.e., forward rate equals backward rate).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2679078"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply encoding reaction stoichiometries, the algebraic structure of the matrix $N$ reveals deep physical principles governing the network, such as conservation laws.

The expression $(y^{\\top} N) v(x)$ is a scalar product between the row vector $y^{\\top} N$ and the column vector $v(x)$. For this product to be zero for any arbitrary vector $v(x)$ with non-negative components, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that the constant vector multiplying it must be the zero vector.\n\nTherefore, the condition for $y^{\\top} x$ to be a conserved total is:\n$$\ny^{\\top} N = \\mathbf{0}^{\\top}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}^{\\top}$ is the zero row vector of dimension $r$.

For any given reaction $R_j$, the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. Let $m = [m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_m]^{\\top}$ be the column vector of molecular masses for species $S_1, \\ldots, S_m$. Since mass must be a positive physical quantity, we require $m_i > 0$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, m$. The net change in total mass for reaction $R_j$ is given by $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_{ij} m_i$.

By choosing an arbitrarily large $\\alpha$, we can make the objective function value $\\alpha t$ arbitrarily large. This scaling ambiguity arises because the equation $N^{\\top}m=0$ is homogeneous.\n\nTo rectify this, we must introduce a normalization constraint on the vector $m$. Since we are searching for a strictly positive vector $m$, its components sum to a positive value. We can, without loss of generality, normalize this sum to unity. If a solution $m^*$ exists, then the vector $m' = m^* / (\\sum_{i=1}^m m_i^*)$ also satisfies $N^{\\top}m'=0$ and has components that sum to $1$. The normalization constraint is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{m} m_i = 1 $$\nAdditionally, since masses cannot be negative, we must enforce the constraint $m_i \\geq 0$ for all $i$. While the condition $m_i \\geq t$ combined with a search for $t > 0$ would imply positivity, explicitly adding $m_i \\geq 0$ makes the feasible set more constrained and is physically correct.\n\nThe final, complete Linear Programming formulation is as follows:\n\n-   **Variables**: A column vector $x = [m_1, \\ldots, m_m, t]^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$.\n-   **Objective**: Maximize $t$. This is equivalent to minimizing $-t$. Thus, the objective function is $c^{\\top}x$ with $c = [0, \\ldots, 0, -1]^{\\top}$.\n-   **Constraints**:\n    1.  **Mass Conservation**: $N^{\\top}m = 0$. This is a set of $r$ linear equality constraints.\n    2.  **Normalization**: $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} m_i = 1$. This is one linear equality constraint.\n    3.  **Positivity Enforcement**: $m_i \\geq t$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, m$. These can be rewritten as $t - m_i \\leq 0$. This is a set of $m$ linear inequality constraints.\n    4.  **Physical Bounds**: $m_i \\geq 0$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, m$. The variable $t$ is unbounded, $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nThe solution of this LP determines stoichiometric consistency:\n-   If the LP is feasible and the optimal value is $t^{\\star} > 0$, a strictly positive mass vector $m$ exists. The network is stoichiometrically consistent.\n-   If the LP is feasible and the optimal value is $t^{\\star} = 0$, a non-negative mass vector $m$ (with at least one zero component) exists, but no strictly positive one does. The network is not stoichiometrically consistent.\n-   If the LP is infeasible, no non-negative mass vector satisfying the conservation and normalization constraints exists. The network is not stoichiometrically consistent.\n\nThis LP formulation provides a rigorous decision procedure derived from first principles. It will now be implemented to analyze the provided test cases.", "answer": "[0.500000,0.000000,-1.000000,0.250000]", "id": "2679061"}]}
