Construct the stoichiometric matrix $N$.\n  2. Determine its rank, $\\operatorname{rank}(N)$.\n  3. Explain the linear dependence among reaction vectors.\n  4. Relate the rank to the dimension of the conservation-law space.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, concerning standard definitions and procedures within chemical reaction network theory. It is well-posed, providing all necessary information for the construction of the stoichiometric matrix and subsequent linear algebraic analysis. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, missing data, or scientifically unsound premises. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Procedure**\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $N$ is a matrix of size $m \\times r$, where $m$ is the number of species and $r$ is the number of reactions. Here, $m=3$ and $r=4$. The element $N_{ij}$ represents the net change in the number of molecules of species $i$ for each occurrence of reaction $j$. We construct the columns of $N$, which are the reaction vectors, for each of the four reactions.\n\nFor reaction $R_1: A \\to B$, one molecule of $A$ is consumed (change is $-1$) and one molecule of $B$ is produced (change is $+1$). Species $C$ is unaffected (change is $0$). The first column of $N$ is therefore:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor reaction $R_2: B \\to A$, one molecule of $B$ is consumed ($-1$) and one molecule of $A$ is produced ($+1$). Species $C$ is unaffected ($0$). The second column is:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor reaction $R_3: B \\to C$, one molecule of $B$ is consumed ($-1$) and one molecule of $C$ is produced ($+1$). Species $A$ is unaffected ($0$). The third column is:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nFor reaction $R_4: C \\to B$, one molecule of $C$ is consumed ($-1$) and one molecule of $B$ is produced ($+1$). Species $A$ is unaffected ($0$). The fourth column is:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nAssembling these column vectors in the specified order gives the stoichiometric matrix $N$:\n$$ N = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nTo determine the rank of $N$, denoted $\\operatorname{rank}(N)$, we find the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). We can observe the linear dependencies among the column vectors directly.\nNotice that $\\mathbf{v}_2 = -1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1$. This means the first two columns are linearly dependent.\nAlso, notice that $\\mathbf{v}_4 = -1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_3$. This means the third and fourth columns are linearly dependent.\nTherefore, the column space of $N$, which is the span of $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\mathbf{v}_3, \\mathbf{v}_4\\}$, is equivalent to the span of just $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_3\\}$.\n\nWe must now check if $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_3$ are linearly independent. We seek constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_3 = \\mathbf{0}$:\n$$ c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis vector equation yields a system of linear equations:\n1. $-c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$\n2. $c_1 - c_2 = 0$\n3. $c_2 = 0$\n\nFrom equations (1) and (3), we find $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$. This is the only solution, which proves that the vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_3$ are linearly independent. Since the column space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the dimension of the column space, and thus the rank of the matrix $N$, is $2$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the rank by reducing $N$ to row echelon form:\n$$ N = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAdd row $1$ to row $2$ ($R_2 \\to R_2 + R_1$):\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAdd row $2$ to row $3$ ($R_3 \\to R_3 + R_2$):\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe resulting matrix in row echelon form has two non-zero rows. Therefore, $\\operatorname{rank}(N) = 2$.\n\nThe left nullspace of $N$ (denoted $\\ker(N^T)$) contains the vectors $\\mathbf{l}$ representing conservation laws, which satisfy $\\mathbf{l}^T N = \\mathbf{0}^T$. The dimension of this conservation-law space is given by the rank-nullity theorem applied to the transpose matrix $N^T$. The dimension of the left nullspace is $\\dim(\\ker(N^T)) = m - \\operatorname{rank}(N^T)$. Since $\\operatorname{rank}(N^T) = \\operatorname{rank}(N)$, the number of independent conservation laws is:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(N^T)) = m - \\operatorname{rank}(N) = 3 - 2 = 1 $$\nThis indicates the existence of one independent conservation law. For this system, the law corresponds to the conservation of the total number of molecules (or total concentration). If $\\mathbf{c} = (c_A, c_B, c_C)^T$ is the vector of concentrations, the conserved quantity is $\\mathbf{l}^T \\mathbf{c}$. The vector $\\mathbf{l} = (1, 1, 1)^T$ is in the left nullspace since:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis confirms that $c_A + c_B + c_C = \\text{constant}$. The rank of $2$ correctly implies that there is $3 - 2 = 1$ such conservation law in the system.\nThe problem requires only the value of the rank.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2636523"}, {"introduction": "Conservation laws have a powerful geometric interpretation, which we explore in this practice.

A solution is now constructed.\n\nThe reaction network $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$ comprises a forward reaction, $R_1: A + B \\to C$, and a reverse reaction, $R_2: C \\to A + B$. The species are ordered as $(A, B, C)$, so the concentration vector is $x = (x_A, x_B, x_C)^{\\top}$ which resides in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nFirst, we identify the reaction vectors. For a reaction, the reaction vector is defined as the vector of product stoichiometries minus the vector of reactant stoichiometries.\n\nFor the forward reaction $R_1$, the reactant complex is $A + B$, corresponding to the vector $(1, 1, 0)^{\\top}$, and the product complex is $C$, corresponding to the vector $(0, 0, 1)^{\\top}$. The reaction vector for $R_1$ is thus:\n$$ \\gamma_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor the reverse reaction $R_2$, the reactant complex is $C$ and the product complex is $A+B$. The reaction vector for $R_2$ is:\n$$ \\gamma_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNotice that $\\gamma_2 = -\\gamma_1$.\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $N$ is formed by using the reaction vectors as its columns. Since $\\gamma_2$ is linearly dependent on $\\gamma_1$, the column space of the matrix $[\\gamma_1 \\; \\gamma_2]$ is one-dimensional. We can therefore represent the stoichiometry of the network with a single reaction vector. We choose $\\gamma_1$. The stoichiometric matrix $N$ is:\n$$ N = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe stoichiometric subspace, $S$, is the column space of $N$. It is the subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ spanned by the columns of $N$.\n$$ S = \\text{span} \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} $$\nThis is a one-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nNext, we compute the orthogonal complement of the stoichiometric subspace, $S^{\\perp}$. A vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is in $S^{\\perp}$ if and only if its dot product with every vector in $S$ is zero. It is sufficient to require orthogonality with the basis vector(s) of $S$:\n$$ w^{\\top} \\gamma_1 = 0 $$\nLet $w = (w_A, w_B, w_C)^{\\top}$. The condition becomes:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} w_A & w_B & w_C \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = -w_A - w_B + w_C = 0 $$\nThis equation defines a plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The dimension of $S^{\\perp}$ is $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^3) - \\dim(S) = 3 - 1 = 2$. We need to find two linearly independent basis vectors for this plane. The problem specifies that these should be integer vectors with minimal non-negative entries.\n\nFrom the condition $w_C = w_A + w_B$, we can choose values for $w_A$ and $w_B$ to find basis vectors.\n1. Let $w_A = 1$ and $w_B = 0$. Then $w_C = 1 + 0 = 1$. This gives the first basis vector, $b_1$:\n$$ b_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n2. Let $w_A = 0$ and $w_B = 1$. Then $w_C = 0 + 1 = 1$. This gives the second basis vector, $b_2$:\n$$ b_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe vectors $b_1$ and $b_2$ are linearly independent and satisfy the condition of having minimal non-negative integer entries. The basis for $S^{\\perp}$ is $\\{b_1, b_2\\}$.\n\nEach vector $w \\in S^{\\perp}$ defines a linear conservation law. The time evolution of the concentration vector $x(t)$ is given by the reaction rate equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = N \\cdot v(x,k)$, where $v$ is the vector of reaction rates. For any $w \\in S^{\\perp}$, we have $w^{\\top}N = 0$. The time derivative of the quantity $w^{\\top}x$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(w^{\\top}x) = w^{\\top}\\frac{dx}{dt} = w^{\\top}(N \\cdot v) = (w^{\\top}N) \\cdot v = 0 \\cdot v = 0 $$\nThis shows that $w^{\\top}x$ is a constant of motion, i.e., a conserved quantity.\n\nFor our first basis vector $b_1 = (1, 0, 1)^{\\top}$, the conserved quantity is:\n$$ C_1 = b_1^{\\top}x = x_A + x_C $$\nThis represents the total amount of moiety $A$ in the system, either as the free species $A$ or as part of the complex $C$.\n\nFor our second basis vector $b_2 = (0, 1, 1)^{\\top}$, the conserved quantity is:\n$$ C_2 = b_2^{\\top}x = x_B + x_C $$\nThis represents the total amount of moiety $B$ in the system, either as the free species $B$ or as part of the complex $C$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these conserved totals using the given initial condition: $x(0) = (x_A(0), x_B(0), x_C(0))^{\\top} = (2.0, 1.5, 0.5)^{\\top}$ $\\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\nSince the totals are constant for all time, we can evaluate them at $t=0$.\n\nTotal $1$ (associated with $b_1$):\n$$ T_1 = x_A(0) + x_C(0) = 2.0 + 0.5 = 2.5 $$\nThe unit is $\\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\n\nTotal $2$ (associated with $b_2$):\n$$ T_2 = x_B(0) + x_C(0) = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0 $$\nThe unit is $\\text{mol L}^{-1}$.\n\nThe two conserved totals are $2.5$ and $2.0$, corresponding to the basis vectors $b_1$ and $b_2$ respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2.5 & 2.0 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2684586"}, {"introduction": "Conservation laws are not intrinsic to the species but are emergent properties of the network's topology.

There are no conservation laws in Case 1. For $y = [1, 0, -1]^\\top$, $y^\\top N = [-1, -1, 2, -1] \\neq 0^\\top$. The second part is incorrect. In Case 2, the conservation law is for $y = [1, 1, 1]^\\top$, not $[1, 0, -1]^\\top$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. With all four reactions present, there is one conservation law $[A]+[B]$. After deleting $A \\to \\varnothing$, there are no conservation laws.\nThe first part is incorrect. There are no conservation laws in Case 1. For $y = [1, 1, 0]^\\top$, $y^\\top N = [0, -1, 1, -1] \\neq 0^\\top$. The second part is also incorrect. We found one conservation law in Case 2, not zero.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2636508"}]}
