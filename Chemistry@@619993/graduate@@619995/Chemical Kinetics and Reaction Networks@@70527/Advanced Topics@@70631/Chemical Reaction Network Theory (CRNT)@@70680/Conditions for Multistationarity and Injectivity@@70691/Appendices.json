The species vector is $x = (x_A, x_B, x_C)^{\\top}$ and the reactions are ordered as $r_1: A \\to B$, $r_{-1}: B \\to A$, $r_2: B \\to C$, and $r_{-2}: C \\to B$.\n\nFirst, we construct the stoichiometric matrix $S$. The columns of $S$ are the reaction vectors, which represent the net change in species concentrations for each reaction. The species are ordered $(A, B, C)$.\nFor $r_1: A \\to B$, the change is $(-1, 1, 0)^{\\top}$.\nFor $r_{-1}: B \\to A$, the change is $(1, -1, 0)^{\\top}$.\nFor $r_2: B \\to C$, the change is $(0, -1, 1)^{\\top}$.\nFor $r_{-2}: C \\to B$, the change is $(0, 1, -1)^{\\top}$.\nCombining these column vectors in the specified order gives the $3 \\times 4$ stoichiometric matrix:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the stoichiometric subspace $\\mathcal{S} = \\operatorname{im}(S)$ and its orthogonal complement $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$. The subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ is the column space of $S$. We observe that the second column is the negative of the first, and the fourth column is the negative of the third. Thus, the column space is spanned by the first and third columns, which are $\\{(-1, 1, 0)^{\\top}, (0, -1, 1)^{\\top}\\}$. These two vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s = \\operatorname{rank}(S) = 2$.\nThe subspace is $\\mathcal{S} = \\operatorname{span}\\left\\{(-1, 1, 0)^{\\top}, (0, -1, 1)^{\\top}\\right\\}$.\n\nThe orthogonal complement, $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$, is the null space of $S^{\\top}$. Let $w = (w_A, w_B, w_C)^{\\top}$ be a vector in $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$. Then $S^{\\top}w = 0$.\n$$\nS^{\\top}w = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} w_A \\\\ w_B \\\\ w_C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -w_A + w_B \\\\ w_A - w_B \\\\ -w_B + w_C \\\\ w_B - w_C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis system of equations implies $w_A = w_B$ and $w_B = w_C$. Thus, any vector in $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$ must be of the form $(\\alpha, \\alpha, \\alpha)^{\\top}$ for some scalar $\\alpha$. A basis for this one-dimensional space is given by the vector $w = (1, 1, 1)^{\\top}$.\n\nThe vectors in $\\mathcal{S}^{\\perp}$ define the linear conservation laws of the system. For $w = (1, 1, 1)^{\\top}$, we have $\\frac{d}{dt}(w^{\\top}x) = w^{\\top}\\dot{x} = w^{\\top}S v(x) = (S^{\\top}w)^{\\top}v(x) = 0^{\\top}v(x) = 0$.\nThis establishes that $w^{\\top}x = x_A + x_B + x_C$ is a constant of motion. This is the law of conservation of mass for this closed system.\nThe value of this constant is determined by the initial condition $x_0 = (x_A^0, x_B^0, x_C^0)^{\\top}$. So, for any time $t \\ge 0$, we have $x_A(t) + x_B(t) + x_C(t) = x_A^0 + x_B^0 + x_C^0$.\nThe positive stoichiometric compatibility class through $x_0$ is the set of all positive concentration vectors satisfying this conservation law: $\\mathcal{C}_{x_0}^{+} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}^3 \\mid x_A + x_B + x_C = x_A^0 + x_B^0 + x_C^0 \\}$. This set is an open triangular region within a plane in the positive orthant.\n\nTo assess the possibility of multistationarity, we use fundamental results from Chemical Reaction Network Theory, specifically the Deficiency Zero Theorem. We must first compute the network deficiency, $\\delta = n - l - s$.\n1.  The number of complexes, $n$, is the number of distinct chemical entities at the start and end of reaction arrows. These are $\\{A, B, C\\}$. Thus, $n=3$.\n2.  The number of linkage classes, $l$, is the number of connected components in the reaction graph. The graph is $A \\leftrightarrow B \\leftrightarrow C$, which is a single connected component. Thus, $l=1$.\n3.  The dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$, was already determined to be $\\operatorname{rank}(S)=2$.\nThe network deficiency is therefore $\\delta = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\nThe network is specified as reversible, meaning every reaction has a reverse reaction with a positive rate constant. A reversible network is necessarily weakly reversible (every reaction is part of a directed cycle in the reaction graph).\nThe Deficiency Zero Theorem states that for a weakly reversible network with deficiency $\\delta=0$, the system of ordinary differential equations admits exactly one equilibrium within each positive stoichiometric compatibility class, for any choice of positive rate constants.\nSince our network satisfies these conditions ($\\delta=0$ and it is weakly reversible), we conclude that multistationarity is not possible. For any given total mass, specified by the initial condition, there is one and only one positive steady state. This implies that the mapping from the rate constants to the steady state concentration is injective on each compatibility class.\n\nFinally, we are asked to identify the scalar invariant $T(x_0)$ that labels the compatibility class passing through $x_0$. As derived from the conservation law, this invariant is simply the total concentration of all species, which is constant throughout the evolution of the system. Its value is set by the initial state $x_0$.\n$$\nT(x_0) = x_A^0 + x_B^0 + x_C^0\n$$\nThis quantity uniquely defines the hyperplane on which the entire trajectory $x(t)$ lies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x_A^0 + x_B^0 + x_C^0}\n$$", "id": "2635073"}, {"introduction": "While network structure can forbid multistationarity, certain motifs like autocatalysis are known to enable it.

Both equations yield the same steady-state condition:\n$$\nk_1 x y^2 - k_2 y = 0\n$$\nThe system is subject to the conservation law $x(t) + y(t) = M$, which allows us to reduce the system to a single variable. We express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = M - y$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation gives an equation solely in terms of $y$:\n$$\nk_1 (M - y) y^2 - k_2 y = 0\n$$\nTo find the steady-state polynomial $f(y)$, we expand and rearrange the terms:\n$$\nk_1 M y^2 - k_1 y^3 - k_2 y = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and ordering by powers of $y$ gives the standard polynomial form.

The general form of a cubic polynomial is $Ay^3 + By^2 + Cy + D$. Its discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 18ABCD - 4B^3D + B^2C^2 - 4AC^3 - 27A^2D^2$.\nFor our polynomial $f(y)$, the coefficients are:\n- $A = k_1$\n- $B = -k_1 M$\n- $C = k_2$\n- $D = 0$\nSince $D=0$, the discriminant formula simplifies considerably to $\\Delta = B^2C^2 - 4AC^3$. Substituting the coefficients:\n$$\n\\Delta = (-k_1 M)^2(k_2)^2 - 4(k_1)(k_2)^3\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = k_1^2 M^2 k_2^2 - 4 k_1 k_2^3\n$$\nFactoring out common terms yields the closed-form expression for the discriminant:\n$$\n\\Delta = k_1 k_2^2 (k_1 M^2 - 4k_2)\n$$\nThis completes Task 2.\n\nFor Task 3, we analyze the conditions for the existence of multiple positive steady states. A steady state $(x,y)$ is positive if $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. From the conservation law $x = M - y$, this is equivalent to requiring $0 < y < M$. The steady-state values of $y$ are the roots of $f(y)=0$. We factor $f(y)$ to analyze its roots:\n$$\nf(y) = y(k_1 y^2 - k_1 M y + k_2) = 0\n$$\nOne root is immediately apparent: $y_0 = 0$. This corresponds to a boundary steady state $(x, y) = (M, 0)$, which is not a positive steady state.\nThe other potential steady states are the roots of the quadratic factor $g(y) = k_1 y^2 - k_1 M y + k_2 = 0$. For the network to exhibit multistationarity, this quadratic equation must have two distinct, positive roots that are also less than $M$.\n\nThe existence of two distinct real roots for $g(y)=0$ is guaranteed if its discriminant, $\\Delta_g$, is positive.\n$$\n\\Delta_g = (-k_1 M)^2 - 4(k_1)(k_2) = k_1^2 M^2 - 4k_1 k_2\n$$\nThe condition for two distinct real roots is $\\Delta_g > 0$, which implies $k_1^2 M^2 > 4k_1 k_2$. Since $k_1 > 0$, we can divide by it to get $k_1 M^2 > 4k_2$.\n\nNow, we must check if these two distinct real roots, let us call them $y_1$ and $y_2$, are physically meaningful, i.e., $y_1, y_2 \\in (0, M)$. We use Vieta's formulas for the roots of $g(y)$:\n- Sum of roots: $y_1 + y_2 = -(-k_1 M) / k_1 = M$.\n- Product of roots: $y_1 y_2 = k_2 / k_1$.\n\nSince $k_1 > 0$, $k_2 > 0$, and $M > 0$, both the sum and the product of the roots are positive. If two real numbers have a positive sum and a positive product, both numbers must be positive. Thus, if the roots are real, they are guaranteed to be positive.\n\nFinally, we must ensure both roots are less than $M$. Since their sum is $M$ and both are positive, it is a mathematical certainty that each root must be less than $M$. For instance, if $y_1 > 0$, then $y_2 = M - y_1 < M$. Similarly, $y_1 = M - y_2 < M$. Therefore, the two roots $y_1, y_2$ lie strictly in the interval $(0, M)$.\n\nThe sole condition for the existence of two distinct positive steady states is $\\Delta_g > 0$, which is $k_1 M^2 > 4k_2$.\n\nWe now connect this result to the discriminant $\\Delta$ of the cubic polynomial $f(y)$. A positive cubic discriminant, $\\Delta > 0$, signifies that the cubic polynomial has three distinct real roots. In our case, these roots are $y_0=0$ and the two distinct roots of the quadratic factor $g(y)$. As we have shown, when the roots of $g(y)$ are real and distinct, they are positive and lie in $(0,M)$.\nThe sign of our cubic discriminant $\\Delta = k_1 k_2^2(k_1 M^2 - 4k_2)$ is determined by the sign of the term $(k_1 M^2 - 4k_2)$, since $k_1 k_2^2 > 0$.\nThe condition $\\Delta > 0$ is therefore equivalent to $k_1 M^2 - 4k_2 > 0$, or $k_1 M^2 > 4k_2$.\n\nThus, the parameter region in which the network admits multiple positive steady states (specifically, two positive steady states and one boundary steady state) is defined by the inequality $k_1 M^2 > 4k_2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the discriminant $\\Delta$ as the final answer.\n$$\n\\Delta = k_1^2 k_2^2 M^2 - 4k_1 k_2^3\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_1^2 k_2^2 M^2 - 4k_1 k_2^3}\n$$", "id": "2635177"}, {"introduction": "The existence of multiple steady states is fundamentally a failure of injectivity of the species formation rate function on a given compatibility class.

Let $P(y) = 2y^{3} - 7y^{2} + 7y - 2$.\nFor $y=1$: $P(1) = 2(1)^{3} - 7(1)^{2} + 7(1) - 2 = 2 - 7 + 7 - 2 = 0$.\nThus, $y=1$ is a root, and $(y-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial. We perform polynomial division:\n$$ \\frac{2y^{3} - 7y^{2} + 7y - 2}{y - 1} = 2y^{2} - 5y + 2 $$\nSo, the equation can be factored as $(y-1)(2y^{2} - 5y + 2) = 0$.\nThe remaining roots are found by solving the quadratic equation $2y^{2} - 5y + 2 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ y = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^{2} - 4(2)(2)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4} $$\nThis gives two more roots:\n$y = \\frac{5+3}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$\n$y = \\frac{5-3}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThe steady-state values for the concentration of $Y$ are $\\{ \\frac{1}{2}, 1, 2 \\}$.\nFor each of these values, we must have a positive concentration of $X$, i.e., $x = 3-y  0$, or $y  3$. All three roots satisfy this condition.\n- If $y = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $x = 3 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n- If $y = 1$, then $x = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n- If $y = 2$, then $x = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nAll three steady states $(x,y) \\in \\{ (\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}), (2,1), (1,2) \\}$ are physically meaningful as they lie in the positive quadrant. The existence of three distinct positive steady states confirms multistationarity and thus demonstrates a failure of injectivity within this compatibility class.\n\nThe problem defines $y_{\\mathrm{low}}$ as the smallest and $y_{\\mathrm{high}}$ as the largest positive steady-state values of $y$. From our set of solutions $\\{ \\frac{1}{2}, 1, 2 \\}$, we have:\n$y_{\\mathrm{low}} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$y_{\\mathrm{high}} = 2$\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the product $y_{\\mathrm{low}} \\, y_{\\mathrm{high}}$.\n$$ y_{\\mathrm{low}} \\cdot y_{\\mathrm{high}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1 $$\nThis is the required numerical answer. It is notable that the product of the two outer roots is $1$, which is half the constant term of the quadratic factor $2y^2 - 5y + 2$. Specifically, for a quadratic $ay^2+by+c=0$, the product of the roots is $c/a$. Here, $c/a = 2/2 = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2635074"}]}
