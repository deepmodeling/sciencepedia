It presents a standard, formalizable exercise in chemical reaction network theory, using established definitions and principles without any factual or logical contradictions. All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and a solution is warranted.\n\nWe begin by systematically addressing each required task based on the foundational definitions of chemical reaction network theory.\n\nThe species of the system are $S_1 = A$ and $S_2 = B$. The complexes, in the specified order, are $C_1 = 2A$, $C_2 = A+B$, and $C_3 = 2B$. The ordered directed reactions are $R_1: C_1 \\to C_2$, $R_2: C_2 \\to C_1$, $R_3: C_2 \\to C_3$, and $R_4: C_3 \\to C_2$.\n\nFirst, we construct the complex composition matrix $Y$. This is a matrix of size (number of species) $\\times$ (number of complexes), which is $2 \\times 3$. The entry $Y_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $S_i$ in complex $C_j$.\nFor $C_1 = 2A + 0B$, the first column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $C_2 = 1A + 1B$, the second column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $C_3 = 0A + 2B$, the third column is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nCombining these columns gives the matrix:\n$$Y = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nSecond, we construct the complex-incidence matrix $I$. This is a matrix of size (number of complexes) $\\times$ (number of reactions), which is $3 \\times 4$. Each column corresponds to a directed reaction, with a $-1$ for the source complex and a $+1$ for the product complex.\nReaction $R_1: C_1 \\to C_2$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nReaction $R_2: C_2 \\to C_1$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nReaction $R_3: C_2 \\to C_3$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nReaction $R_4: C_3 \\to C_2$ corresponds to the column $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe resulting matrix is:\n$$I = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThird, we construct the weighted Laplacian on complexes, $A_k$. This is a square matrix of size (number of complexes) $\\times$ (number of complexes), so $3 \\times 3$. The off-diagonal entry $(A_k)_{ij}$ is the rate constant of the reaction $C_j \\to C_i$. The diagonal entry $(A_k)_{ii}$ is the negative sum of rate constants for all reactions originating from complex $C_i$.\nThe reactions and their rates are: $C_1 \\to C_2$ with rate $k_1$, $C_2 \\to C_1$ with rate $k_2$, $C_2 \\to C_3$ with rate $k_3$, and $C_3 \\to C_2$ with rate $k_4$.\nOff-diagonal entries: $(A_k)_{21} = k_1$, $(A_k)_{12} = k_2$, $(A_k)_{32} = k_3$, $(A_k)_{23} = k_4$. All other off-diagonal entries are $0$.\nDiagonal entries:\n$(A_k)_{11} = -(\\text{rate out of } C_1) = -k_1$.\n$(A_k)_{22} = -(\\text{rate out of } C_2) = -(k_2 + k_3)$.\n$(A_k)_{33} = -(\\text{rate out of } C_3) = -k_4$.\nThe matrix is therefore:\n$$A_k = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_1 & k_2 & 0 \\\\ k_1 & -(k_2+k_3) & k_4 \\\\ 0 & k_3 & -k_4 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFourth, we compute the deficiency, $\\delta = n - \\ell - s$.\nThe number of complexes is $n=3$.\nThe number of linkage classes, $\\ell$, is the number of connected components in the reaction graph $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_2 \\leftrightarrow C_3$. This graph is a single connected component, so $\\ell=1$.\nThe dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$, is the rank of the stoichiometric matrix $S = YI$.\n$$S = YI = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe second row of $S$ is the negative of the first row. Thus, the rows are linearly dependent, and the rank of the matrix is $s = \\operatorname{rank}(S) = 1$.\nThe deficiency is $\\delta = n - \\ell - s = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$.\n\nFifth, we derive the conditions for complex balance and detailed balance. Let the concentrations of species $A$ and $B$ be $c_A$ and $c_B$. The vector of mass-action monomials corresponding to the complexes $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ is $\\psi(c) = (c_A^2, c_A c_B, c_B^2)^T$.\n\nA positive equilibrium $c^* = (c_A^*, c_B^*)^T$ (with $c_A^*>0$, $c_B^*>0$) is complex-balanced if $A_k \\psi(c^*) = 0$. This gives the system of linear equations in the variables $(c_A^*)^2$, $c_A^* c_B^*$, and $(c_B^*)^2$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -k_1 & k_2 & 0 \\\\ k_1 & -(k_2+k_3) & k_4 \\\\ 0 & k_3 & -k_4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (c_A^*)^2 \\\\ c_A^* c_B^* \\\\ (c_B^*)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis expands to three equations:\n1. $-k_1(c_A^*)^2 + k_2 c_A^* c_B^* = 0$\n2. $k_1(c_A^*)^2 - (k_2+k_3)c_A^* c_B^* + k_4(c_B^*)^2 = 0$\n3. $k_3 c_A^* c_B^* - k_4(c_B^*)^2 = 0$\nFor a positive equilibrium, we can divide by the non-zero concentrations. From equation (1), $k_1 c_A^* = k_2 c_B^*$, which implies $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$. From equation (3), $k_3 c_A^* = k_4 c_B^*$, which implies $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4}$.\nFor a positive solution to exist, these two expressions for the ratio of concentrations must be consistent:\n$$ \\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4} $$\nThis is equivalent to the algebraic condition $k_1 k_4 - k_2 k_3 = 0$. If this condition holds, then equation (2) is automatically satisfied, as it is a linear combination of equations (1) and (3). Thus, $k_1 k_4 - k_2 k_3 = 0$ is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium.\n\nNext, we examine the condition for detailed balance. A positive equilibrium $c^*$ is detailed-balanced if, for every reversible reaction step, the forward rate equals the reverse rate. The network consists of two reversible steps:\n1. $2A \\rightleftharpoons A+B$: The detailed balance condition is $k_1 (c_A^*)^2 = k_2 c_A^* c_B^*$. For $c_A^*>0$, this gives $k_1 c_A^* = k_2 c_B^*$, or $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$.\n2. $A+B \\rightleftharpoons 2B$: The detailed balance condition is $k_3 c_A^* c_B^* = k_4 (c_B^*)^2$. For $c_B^*>0$, this gives $k_3 c_A^* = k_4 c_B^*$, or $\\frac{c_B^*}{c_A^*} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4}$.\nFor a single equilibrium point $c^*$ to satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we must have $\\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\frac{k_3}{k_4}$, which is identical to the condition derived for complex balance.\n\nThe analysis confirms that for this network, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive complex-balanced equilibrium is the same as that for a positive detailed-balanced equilibrium. This condition is $k_1 k_4 = k_2 k_3$. The polynomial expression that must equate to zero is therefore $k_1 k_4 - k_2 k_3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_{1}k_{4} - k_{2}k_{3}}$$", "id": "2634118"}, {"introduction": "While detailed balance signifies thermodynamic equilibrium, complex balancing can describe a broader class of steady states, including those maintained by a constant energy throughput.

The edges, with their specified orientations, are:\n- $e_1: C_1 \\to C_2$\n- $e_2: C_2 \\to C_3$\n- $e_3: C_3 \\to C_1$\n- $e_4: C_1 \\to C_4$\n- $e_5: C_4 \\to C_3$\n\nThe graph structure consists of two triangles, $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ and $(C_1, C_3, C_4)$, which share the common edge $\\{C_1, C_3\\}$. This is evident as edges $e_1, e_2, e_3$ form the first triangle, and edges connecting $C_1, C_3, C_4$ are $\\{C_1, C_3\\}$ (part of $e_3$), $\\{C_1, C_4\\}$ ($e_4$), and $\\{C_3, C_4\\}$ (related to $e_5$).\n\nTo find a fundamental cycle basis, we must first select a spanning tree. A spanning tree for a graph with $n$ vertices is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices. It must contain $n-1 = 3$ edges. A judicious choice for the spanning tree simplifies the identification of fundamental cycles. Let us select the following set of edges for our spanning tree, $T$:\n$T = \\{ e_1, e_3, e_5 \\}$.\nThese edges are $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$, $\\{C_3, C_1\\}$, and $\\{C_4, C_3\\}$. This forms the path $C_2 - C_1 - C_3 - C_4$, which connects all four vertices and contains no cycles. Thus, it is a valid spanning tree.\n\nThe edges not in the spanning tree are called chords. Adding a chord to the spanning tree creates exactly one fundamental cycle. The set of chords is $E \\setminus T = \\{e_2, e_4\\}$. There are two chords, consistent with the cycle space dimension of $2$.\n\n1.  **Fundamental cycle $c_1$ associated with chord $e_2$**: The chord $e_2$ connects vertices $C_2$ and $C_3$. The unique path in the spanning tree $T$ between $C_2$ and $C_3$ is $C_2 - C_1 - C_3$, which uses edges $e_1$ and $e_3$. Therefore, the cycle $c_1$ consists of edges $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$. We must define an orientation for this cycle to determine the signs in the incidence matrix. Let us define the cycle direction as $C_1 \\to C_2 \\to C_3 \\to C_1$.\n    - The traversal $C_1 \\to C_2$ is along the specified direction of $e_1$, so its entry is $+1$.\n    - The traversal $C_2 \\to C_3$ is along the specified direction of $e_2$, so its entry is $+1$.\n    - The traversal $C_3 \\to C_1$ is along the specified direction of $e_3$, so its entry is $+1$.\n    - Edges $e_4$ and $e_5$ are not in this cycle, so their entries are $0$.\n    The row vector for $c_1$ is $(1, 1, 1, 0, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Fundamental cycle $c_2$ associated with chord $e_4$**: The chord $e_4$ connects vertices $C_1$ and $C_4$. The unique path in $T$ between $C_1$ and $C_4$ is $C_1 - C_3 - C_4$, which uses edges $e_3$ and $e_5$. Therefore, the cycle $c_2$ consists of edges $\\{e_3, e_4, e_5\\}$. Let us define the cycle direction as $C_3 \\to C_1 \\to C_4 \\to C_3$.\n    - The traversal $C_3 \\to C_1$ is along the specified direction of $e_3$, so its entry is $+1$.\n    - The traversal $C_1 \\to C_4$ is along the specified direction of $e_4$, so its entry is $+1$.\n    - The traversal $C_4 \\to C_3$ is along the specified direction of $e_5$, so its entry is $+1$.\n    - Edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are not in this cycle, so their entries are $0$.\n    The row vector for $c_2$ is $(0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$.\n\nThe cycle-edge incidence matrix $B$ is constructed with these two row vectors, corresponding to cycles $c_1$ and $c_2$. The columns correspond to edges $e_1$ through $e_5$.\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo confirm the correctness of this construction, we verify the condition $B\\boldsymbol{\\ell}=\\boldsymbol{0}$. The vector $\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$ is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_j = \\ln(k_j^+/k_j^-)$, where $k_j^+$ and $k_j^-$ are the forward and reverse rate constants for reaction $j$.\nFor cycle $c_1$, the Wegscheider condition is that the product of forward rate constants divided by the product of reverse rate constants along the cycle is unity:\n$$ \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}} \\frac{k_{23}}{k_{32}} \\frac{k_{31}}{k_{13}} = 1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{23}}{k_{32}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{31}}{k_{13}}\\right) = 1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_1 + 1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_2 + 1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_3 + 0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_4 + 0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_5 = 0 $$\nThis matches the first row of $B$ applied to $\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$.\n\nFor cycle $c_2$, the condition is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{31}}{k_{13}} \\frac{k_{14}}{k_{41}} \\frac{k_{43}}{k_{34}} = 1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{31}}{k_{13}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{14}}{k_{41}}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{43}}{k_{34}}\\right) = 0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_1 + 0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_2 + 1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_3 + 1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_4 + 1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_5 = 0 $$\nThis matches the second row of $B$ applied to $\\boldsymbol{\\ell}$.\n\nThe derived matrix $B$ correctly represents a valid cycle basis and its relationship to the detailed balance conditions. The construction is rigorous and follows standard procedure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2634048"}]}
