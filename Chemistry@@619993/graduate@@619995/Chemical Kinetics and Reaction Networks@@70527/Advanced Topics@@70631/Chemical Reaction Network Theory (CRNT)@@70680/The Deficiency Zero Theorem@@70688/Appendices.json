Since all listed complexes are distinct, we have:\n$$ n = |\\mathcal{C}| = 6 $$\n\nTask 2: Determine the linkage classes and compute $l$.\nThe reaction graph has the complexes as its vertices and the reactions as its edges. A linkage class is a connected component of this graph. The reactions define the connections:\n1. The reaction $A+B \\rightleftharpoons 2A$ connects the complexes $A+B$ and $2A$.\n2. The reaction $C \\rightleftharpoons B$ connects the complexes $C$ and $B$.\n3. The reaction $A \\rightleftharpoons 2C$ connects the complexes $A$ and $2C$.\nThere are no reactions connecting members of one pair to members of another. For example, there is no reaction converting $2A$ into $C$ or $B$. Thus, the reaction graph decomposes into three disjoint subgraphs. The linkage classes are:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_1 = \\{A+B, 2A\\} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_2 = \\{C, B\\} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_3 = \\{A, 2C\\} $$\nThe number of linkage classes, $l$, is the number of these components. Therefore:\n$$ l = 3 $$\n\nTask 3: Compute the stoichiometric subspace and its dimension $s$.\nFirst, we represent each complex as a vector in the species space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with the basis corresponding to the ordered species $(A, B, C)$.\nThe complex vectors are:\n$y_{A+B} = (1, 1, 0)^T$\n$y_{2A} = (2, 0, 0)^T$\n$y_C = (0, 0, 1)^T$\n$y_B = (0, 1, 0)^T$\n$y_A = (1, 0, 0)^T$\n$y_{2C} = (0, 0, 2)^T$\n\nThe reaction vectors are the differences between the product complex vector and the reactant complex vector for each reaction.\nFor $R_1 (A+B \\to 2A)$: $v_1 = y_{2A} - y_{A+B} = (2, 0, 0)^T - (1, 1, 0)^T = (1, -1, 0)^T$.\nFor $R_2 (C \\to B)$: $v_2 = y_B - y_C = (0, 1, 0)^T - (0, 0, 1)^T = (0, 1, -1)^T$.\nFor $R_3 (A \\to 2C)$: $v_3 = y_{2C} - y_A = (0, 0, 2)^T - (1, 0, 0)^T = (-1, 0, 2)^T$.\nThe reverse reactions produce vectors that are the negatives of these, which does not change the spanned space.\n\nThe stoichiometric subspace, $S$, is the linear span of these reaction vectors: $S = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. The dimension of $S$, denoted by $s$, is the rank of the matrix whose columns are these vectors. Let this matrix be $M$:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the dimension $s$, we determine if these vectors are linearly independent by computing the determinant of $M$:\n$$ \\det(M) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(M) = 1(1 \\cdot 2 - 0 \\cdot (-1)) - 0 + (-1)((-1)(-1) - 1 \\cdot 0) $$\n$$ \\det(M) = 1(2) - 1(1) = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\nSince $\\det(M) \\neq 0$, the vectors $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are linearly independent. The dimension of the space they span is therefore $3$.\n$$ s = \\dim(S) = 3 $$\n\nTask 4: Compute the deficiency $\\delta$.\nThe deficiency of a reaction network is defined by the formula $\\delta = n - l - s$. Using the values computed in the previous tasks:\n$$ \\delta = n - l - s = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0 $$\nThe deficiency of the network is $\\delta = 0$.\n\nTask 5: Check whether the network is weakly reversible.\nA network is weakly reversible if for any two complexes $y_i, y_j$ in the same linkage class, there is a directed path of reactions from $y_i$ to $y_j$ and a directed path from $y_j$ to $y_i$. In other words, every linkage class must be a strongly connected component of the reaction graph.\nThe problem statement specifies that all three reactions are reversible, denoted by the $\\rightleftharpoons$ symbol.\n1. In linkage class $\\mathcal{L}_1 = \\{A+B, 2A\\}$, the reactions $A+B \\to 2A$ and $2A \\to A+B$ both exist. This class is strongly connected.\n2. In linkage class $\\mathcal{L}_2 = \\{C, B\\}$, the reactions $C \\to B$ and $B \\to C$ both exist. This class is strongly connected.\n3. In linkage class $\\mathcal{L}_3 = \\{A, 2C\\}$, the reactions $A \\to 2C$ and $2C \\to A$ both exist. This class is strongly connected.\nSince all linkage classes are strongly connected, the network is weakly reversible.\n\nTask 6: Using the deficiency zero theorem, draw a conclusion.\nThe Deficiency Zero Theorem states that if a chemical reaction network has a deficiency of $\\delta=0$ and is weakly reversible, then for any choice of positive rate constants, the resulting mass-action kinetic system admits exactly one equilibrium in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class. This equilibrium is positive and locally asymptotically stable.\n\nFrom our analysis:\n- The deficiency is $\\delta = 0$.\n- The network is weakly reversible.\n\nBoth hypotheses of the Deficiency Zero Theorem are satisfied. Therefore, its conclusions apply.\nA stoichiometric compatibility class is a set of concentration vectors $\\{c \\in \\mathbb{R}^m_{\\ge 0} \\mid c - c_0 \\in S\\}$ for some initial concentration vector $c_0$. The dimension of the space of such classes is $m-s$, where $m=3$ is the number of species. Here, $m-s = 3-3 = 0$. This means there is only a single stoichiometric compatibility class, which is the entire non-negative orthant $\\mathbb{R}^3_{\\ge 0}$. Any positive initial state $c_0 > 0$ defines the same positive compatibility class, which consists of all positive concentration vectors.\n\nTherefore, for any set of positive rate constants, the system admits a single positive equilibrium in the entire state space $\\mathbb{R}^3_{>0}$. This equilibrium is unique. The conclusion is that yes, for arbitrary positive rate constants, the system admits a positive equilibrium, and it is unique within its stoichiometric compatibility class (of which there is only one).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2684988"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to verify the hypotheses of the Deficiency Zero Theorem, we now move from prediction to direct calculation.

It presents a standard exercise in chemical reaction network theory, requiring the application of fundamental definitions to a specific, clearly described system. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles. Thus, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured into three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Complexes, Linkage Classes, and Weak Reversibility\n\nThe set of species is $\\{X, Y\\}$. The set of complexes, denoted $\\mathcal{C}$, is given as $\\mathcal{C} = \\{X, 0, Y\\}$, where $0$ represents the zero complex. Let us denote these complexes as $C_{1} = X$, $C_{2} = 0$, and $C_{3} = Y$.\n\nThe reactions define a directed graph where the vertices are the complexes. The reactions are:\n$C_{1} \\to C_{2}$ (with rate constant $k_{1}$)\n$C_{2} \\to C_{1}$ (with rate constant $k_{-1}$)\n$C_{3} \\to C_{2}$ (with rate constant $k_{2}$)\n$C_{2} \\to C_{3}$ (with rate constant $k_{-2}$)\n\nA linkage class is a connected component of the reaction graph when viewed as an undirected graph. The edges of this undirected graph are $(C_{1}, C_{2})$ and $(C_{2}, C_{3})$. The resulting graph structure is $C_{1} - C_{2} - C_{3}$. This graph is connected, meaning all three complexes belong to a single linkage class. Therefore, the number of linkage classes, $\\ell$, is $1$. The single linkage class is $\\{X, 0, Y\\}$.\n\nA reaction network is defined as weakly reversible if for any reaction $C_{i} \\to C_{j}$ in the network, there exists a directed path of reactions that leads from $C_{j}$ back to $C_{i}$. We examine each reaction:\n1. For the reaction $X \\to 0$ ($C_{1} \\to C_{2}$), the reverse reaction $0 \\to X$ ($C_{2} \\to C_{1}$) exists. This provides a path of length $1$ from $C_{2}$ to $C_{1}$.\n2. For the reaction $0 \\to X$ ($C_{2} \\to C_{1}$), the reverse reaction $X \\to 0$ ($C_{1} \\to C_{2}$) exists, providing a path from $C_{1}$ to $C_{2}$.\n3. For the reaction $Y \\to 0$ ($C_{3} \\to C_{2}$), the reverse reaction $0 \\to Y$ ($C_{2} \\to C_{3}$) exists, providing a path from $C_{2}$ to $C_{3}$.\n4. For the reaction $0 \\to Y$ ($C_{2} \\to C_{3}$), the reverse reaction $Y \\to 0$ ($C_{3} \\to C_{2}$) exists, providing a path from $C_{3}$ to $C_{2}$.\n\nSince every reaction has its direct reverse reaction present in the network, the network is reversible. Reversibility is a stricter condition than weak reversibility. Therefore, the network is, by definition, weakly reversible.\n\nPart 2: Deficiency Calculation\n\nThe deficiency, $\\delta$, of a chemical reaction network is defined by the formula $\\delta = n - \\ell - s$.\n- $n$ is the number of complexes. As established, $n = 3$.\n- $\\ell$ is the number of linkage classes. As established, $\\ell = 1$.\n- $s$ is the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, which is the vector space spanned by the reaction vectors.\n\nTo determine $s$, we must first represent the complexes as vectors in the space of species, $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with coordinates corresponding to the concentrations of $X$ and $Y$.\n- The complex $C_{1} = X$ is represented by the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The complex $C_{2} = 0$ is represented by the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The complex $C_{3} = Y$ is represented by the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe reaction vector for a reaction $C_{i} \\to C_{j}$ is given by $\\mathbf{y}_{j} - \\mathbf{y}_{i}$.\n- For $X \\to 0$: $\\mathbf{y}_{2} - \\mathbf{y}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- For $0 \\to X$: $\\mathbf{y}_{1} - \\mathbf{y}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- For $Y \\to 0$: $\\mathbf{y}_{2} - \\mathbf{y}_{3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- For $0 \\to Y$: $\\mathbf{y}_{3} - \\mathbf{y}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe stoichiometric subspace $S$ is the span of these vectors:\n$$S = \\text{span}\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$$\nThis set of vectors simplifies to the span of the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$S = \\text{span}\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$$\nThese two vectors are linearly independent and span the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Thus, the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s = \\dim(S) = 2$.\n\nNow, we compute the deficiency:\n$$\\delta = n - \\ell - s = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0$$\nThe network has a deficiency of zero.\n\nPart 3: Complex-Balanced Equilibrium\n\nA system is at a complex-balanced equilibrium if, for every complex $C_{i}$, the sum of the rates of all reactions for which $C_{i}$ is the reactant complex is equal to the sum of the rates of all reactions for which $C_{i}$ is the product complex. Let the concentrations of species $X$ and $Y$ be $x$ and $y$, respectively. Under mass-action kinetics, the reaction rates are:\n- $R_{X \\to 0} = k_{1}x$\n- $R_{0 \\to X} = k_{-1}$ (the \"concentration\" of the zero complex is defined as $1$)\n- $R_{Y \\to 0} = k_{2}y$\n- $R_{0 \\to Y} = k_{-2}$\n\nWe now write the balance equation for each complex at a candidate equilibrium point $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$.\n\n1.  For complex $C_{1} = X$:\n    The flux out of $X$ is from the reaction $X \\to 0$. The flux into $X$ is from $0 \\to X$.\n    $$k_{1}x^{\\ast} = k_{-1}$$\n\n2.  For complex $C_{3} = Y$:\n    The flux out of $Y$ is from the reaction $Y \\to 0$. The flux into $Y$ is from $0 \\to Y$.\n    $$k_{2}y^{\\ast} = k_{-2}$$\n\n3.  For complex $C_{2} = 0$:\n    The flux out of $0$ is from $0 \\to X$ and $0 \\to Y$. The flux into $0$ is from $X \\to 0$ and $Y \\to 0$.\n    $$k_{-1} + k_{-2} = k_{1}x^{\\ast} + k_{2}y^{\\ast}$$\n\nFrom the first two balance equations, we solve directly for the equilibrium concentrations $x^{\\ast}$ and $y^{\\ast}$:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}$$\n$$y^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{-2}}{k_{2}}$$\nWe must verify that these values satisfy the third balance equation. Substituting the expressions for $x^{\\ast}$ and $y^{\\ast}$ into the third equation:\n$$k_{-1} + k_{-2} = k_{1}\\left(\\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}\\right) + k_{2}\\left(\\frac{k_{-2}}{k_{2}}\\right) = k_{-1} + k_{-2}$$\nThe equation holds. The system of equations is consistent, and the equilibrium concentration vector is uniquely determined. Since all rate constants $k_{i}$ are given as positive, the resulting concentrations $x^{\\ast}$ and $y^{\\ast}$ are also positive.\n\nThe positive complex-balanced equilibrium is $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}, \\frac{k_{-2}}{k_{2}}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}, \\frac{k_{-2}}{k_{2}}\\right)}$$", "id": "2684993"}, {"introduction": "The power of a theorem often becomes clearest when we examine cases where its conditions are not met.

For $\\mathcal{N}_A$, the set of complexes is $\\{A, B, C\\}$. The number of complexes is $n=3$.\n    The reaction graph has these complexes as vertices and the reactions as directed edges: $A \\to B \\to C$. This graph is connected, so there is only one connected component, which is called a linkage class. Thus, the number of linkage classes is $l=1$.\n    To determine the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$, we represent the species as basis vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$: $A = (1, 0, 0)^T$, $B = (0, 1, 0)^T$, and $C = (0, 0, 1)^T$. The reaction vectors are given by the difference between product and reactant complexes:\n    - For $A \\to B$: $v_1 = B - A = (-1, 1, 0)^T$.\n    - For $B \\to C$: $v_2 = C - B = (0, -1, 1)^T$.\n    The stoichiometric subspace $S$ is the linear span of these reaction vectors, $S = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, as neither is a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s = \\dim(S) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Deficiency:**\n    The deficiency, $\\delta$, of a reaction network is defined as $\\delta = n - l - s$.\n    For $\\mathcal{N}_A$, we have $n=3$, $l=1$, and $s=2$.\n    The deficiency is $\\delta = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Weak Reversibility:**\n    A network is weakly reversible if every reaction is part of a directed cycle in the reaction graph. Equivalently, every linkage class must be a terminal strongly connected component in the graph of strongly connected components. In the graph $A \\to B \\to C$, there are no cycles. The species $C$ is a terminal state from which no reaction originates. Therefore, the network is not weakly reversible.\n\n4.  **Application of the Deficiency Zero Theorem:**\n    The deficiency zero theorem states that for a network with $\\delta=0$, if it is weakly reversible, then for any set of positive rate constants, the corresponding mass-action system admits exactly one positive equilibrium in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.\n    Since network $\\mathcal{N}_A$ has $\\delta=0$ but is not weakly reversible, the theorem does not guarantee the existence of positive equilibria. Indeed, the kinetic equations are $\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_1[A]$, $\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_1[A] - k_2[B]$, and $\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_2[B]$. At equilibrium, all time derivatives must be zero. From the first equation, $-k_1[A] = 0$ implies $[A]=0$ as $k_1>0$. Substituting into the second, $-k_2[B]=0$ implies $[B]=0$. Thus, no equilibrium with positive concentrations of all species can exist.\n\n**Analysis of Network $\\mathcal{N}_B$: $A \\xrightarrow{k_1} B \\xrightarrow{k_2} C \\xrightarrow{k_3} A$**\n\n1.  **Complexes, Linkage Classes, and Stoichiometric Subspace:**\n    The set of complexes is again $\\{A, B, C\\}$, so $n=3$.\n    The reaction graph consists of the cycle $A \\to B \\to C \\to A$. The graph is strongly connected, forming a single linkage class. Thus, $l=1$.\n    The reaction vectors are:\n    - For $A \\to B$: $v_1 = B - A = (-1, 1, 0)^T$.\n    - For $B \\to C$: $v_2 = C - B = (0, -1, 1)^T$.\n    - For $C \\to A$: $v_3 = A - C = (1, 0, -1)^T$.\n    The stoichiometric subspace is $S = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. We observe that $v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = (-1+0+1, 1-1+0, 0+1-1)^T = (0,0,0)^T$. The set of vectors is linearly dependent. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, the dimension of the subspace is $s = \\dim(S) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Deficiency:**\n    Using $\\delta = n - l - s$, with $n=3$, $l=1$, and $s=2$, we find the deficiency is $\\delta = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Weak Reversibility:**\n    The reaction graph $A \\to B \\to C \\to A$ is a single directed cycle. Every reaction lies on this cycle. Therefore, the network is weakly reversible.\n\n4.  **Application of the Deficiency Zero Theorem and Derivation of Equilibrium Ratio:**\n    Network $\\mathcal{N}_B$ has deficiency $\\delta=0$ and is weakly reversible. By the deficiency zero theorem, for any choice of positive rate constants $k_1, k_2, k_3$, the system is guaranteed to have exactly one positive equilibrium in each positive stoichiometric compatibility class.\n    We now derive the expression for this equilibrium. The system of ordinary differential equations under mass-action kinetics is:\n    $$ \\frac{d x_A}{dt} = k_3 x_C - k_1 x_A $$\n    $$ \\frac{d x_B}{dt} = k_1 x_A - k_2 x_B $$\n    $$ \\frac{d x_C}{dt} = k_2 x_B - k_3 x_C $$\n    where $x_A, x_B, x_C$ denote the concentrations of species $A, B, C$. At equilibrium, the concentrations are constant, denoted by $x_A^{\\ast}, x_B^{\\ast}, x_C^{\\ast}$, and the time derivatives are zero.\n    $$ k_3 x_C^{\\ast} - k_1 x_A^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n    $$ k_1 x_A^{\\ast} - k_2 x_B^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n    $$ k_2 x_B^{\\ast} - k_3 x_C^{\\ast} = 0 $$\n    The problem asks for the ratio $x_A^{\\ast}/x_B^{\\ast}$. From the second equilibrium equation, we have:\n    $$ k_1 x_A^{\\ast} = k_2 x_B^{\\ast} $$\n    Since the deficiency zero theorem guarantees a positive equilibrium, we know that $x_B^{\\ast} > 0$. The rate constants are also given as positive, $k_1 > 0$. We can therefore divide to find the ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{x_A^{\\ast}}{x_B^{\\ast}} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1} $$\n    This is the required expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_2}{k_1}}$$", "id": "2685012"}]}
