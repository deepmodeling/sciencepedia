It is a standard model of competitive binding. I shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of a single promoter, which we denote as $P$, in a solution containing an activator molecule $A$ at concentration $a$ and a repressor molecule $R$ at concentration $r$. The system is at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature $T$. According to the principles of statistical mechanics, the probability of finding the system in a specific microstate $i$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution, which can be expressed in terms of statistical weights. The probability $p_i$ of the system being in state $i$ is:\n$$p_i = \\frac{w_i}{Z}$$\nwhere $w_i$ is the statistical weight of state $i$, and $Z$ is the partition function, defined as the sum of all statistical weights of all accessible microstates:\n$$Z = \\sum_j w_j$$\n\nThe first step is to enumerate the accessible microstates of the promoter $P$. The problem states that the promoter has a single operator site that can be bound by either $A$ or $R$, but not both simultaneously due to steric hindrance. This defines the set of possible states:\n1.  The promoter is unbound. We denote this state as $P_{free}$.\n2.  The promoter is bound by an activator. We denote this state as $P\\!:\\!A$.\n3.  The promoter is bound by a repressor. We denote this state as $P\\!:\\!R$.\n\nA state where both $A$ and $R$ are simultaneously bound, $P\\!:\\!A\\!:\\!R$, is forbidden.\n\nThe second step is to determine the statistical weight for each of these three states. We can choose the unbound state, $P_{free}$, as our reference state and assign it a statistical weight of $1$.\n$$w_{free} = 1$$\nThe statistical weights of the other states are determined relative to this reference state using the law of mass action for the binding equilibria.\n\nFor the binding of the activator $A$ to the promoter $P$:\n$$P + A \\rightleftharpoons P\\!:\\!A$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_A$, is defined as:\n$$K_A = \\frac{[P_{free}][A]}{[P\\!:\\!A]}$$\nwhere $[...]$ denotes concentration at equilibrium. Substituting the given concentration $a$ for $[A]$, we can express the ratio of the concentration of the bound state to the unbound state:\n$$\\frac{[P\\!:\\!A]}{[P_{free}]} = \\frac{a}{K_A}$$\nThis ratio represents the statistical weight of the activator-bound state, $P\\!:\\!A$, relative to the free state. The problem correctly specifies that this ratio is dimensionless.\n$$w_{A} = \\frac{a}{K_A}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the binding of the repressor $R$ to the promoter $P$:\n$$P + R \\rightleftharpoons P\\!:\\!R$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_R$, is defined as:\n$$K_R = \\frac{[P_{free}][R]}{[P\\!:\\!R]}$$\nSubstituting the given concentration $r$ for $[R]$, we find the statistical weight of the repressor-bound state, $P\\!:\\!R$:\n$$\\frac{[P\\!:\\!R]}{[P_{free}]} = \\frac{r}{K_R}$$\nThus,\n$$w_{R} = \\frac{r}{K_R}$$\n\nThe third step is to construct the partition function, $Z$, by summing the statistical weights of all accessible states:\n$$Z = w_{free} + w_{A} + w_{R} = 1 + \\frac{a}{K_A} + \\frac{r}{K_R}$$\nThis partition function is the normalization factor for the probability distribution of the promoter states.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the probability of the event of interest. The problem defines the transcriptionally active state, or \"on\" state, as the one where the activator $A$ is bound to the promoter. This corresponds to the $P\\!:\\!A$ microstate. The probability of this state, $p_{\\text{on}}(a,r)$, is the ratio of its statistical weight, $w_{A}$, to the total partition function, $Z$.\n$$p_{\\text{on}}(a,r) = \\frac{w_{A}}{Z}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $w_{A}$ and $Z$:\n$$p_{\\text{on}}(a,r) = \\frac{\\frac{a}{K_A}}{1 + \\frac{a}{K_A} + \\frac{r}{K_R}}$$\nThis expression gives the probability that the promoter is in the transcriptionally active state as a function of the activator concentration $a$, the repressor concentration $r$, and their respective dissociation constants $K_A$ and $K_R$.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing information that would render it invalid. We will proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nA steady state of the system, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, is a non-negative concentration $x$ at which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $\\dot{x} = 0$. This condition implies that the production rate equals the degradation rate: $f(x^{\\ast}) = g(x^{\\ast})$. We must analyze the number of non-negative solutions to this equation for both forms of the degradation term $g(x)$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the properties of the production function, $f(x) = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{1 + (x/K)^n}$, for $x \\ge 0$. The parameters $\\alpha, K, n$ are all positive.\n1.  At $x=0$, the production rate is maximal: $f(0) = \\alpha > 0$.\n2.  As $x \\to \\infty$, the production rate approaches zero: $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = 0$.\n3.  The derivative is $f'(x) = -\\dfrac{\\alpha n x^{n-1}}{K^n(1+(x/K)^n)^2}$. Since $\\alpha, n, K > 0$, it is clear that $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x > 0$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function on its domain $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nNow we analyze the two degradation scenarios.\n\nTask 1: Existence and Uniqueness of the Steady State\n\nCase I: Linear Degradation, $g(x) = g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) = \\gamma x$.\nThe degradation function $g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$ has the following properties for $\\gamma > 0$:\n1.  $g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0) = 0$.\n2.  $g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x \\ge 0$, as its derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) = \\gamma > 0$.\n\nTo find the steady state(s), we search for intersections of $f(x)$ and $g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$. Let us define an auxiliary function $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) = f(x) - g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$. A steady state is a root of $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)=0$.\n-   At $x=0$, we have $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0) = f(0) - g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(0) = \\alpha - 0 = \\alpha > 0$.\n-   As $x \\to \\infty$, $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) \\to 0 - \\infty$, which is $-\\infty$.\nSince $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$ is a continuous function on $[0, \\infty)$ that starts at a positive value and becomes negative, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{lin}} > 0$.\n\nFor uniqueness, we examine the derivative of $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$: $H'_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) = f'(x) - g'_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$. As established, $f'(x) < 0$ for $x > 0$ and $g'_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) > 0$. Thus, $H'_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) < 0$ for all $x > 0$. This means $H_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function. A strictly monotonic function can cross the horizontal axis at most once. Therefore, there exists a unique steady state $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{lin}} > 0$. This holds for all positive values of the parameters $\\alpha, K, n, \\gamma$.\n\nCase II: Michaelis–Menten (Saturated) Degradation, $g(x) = g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) = \\dfrac{Vx}{K_M + x}$.\nThe degradation function $g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x)$ has the following properties for $V, K_M > 0$:\n1.  $g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(0) = 0$.\n2.  The derivative is $g'_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) = \\dfrac{V K_M}{(K_M + x)^2} > 0$. Thus, $g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x \\ge 0$.\n3.  As $x \\to \\infty$, the degradation rate saturates at its maximal velocity: $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) = V$.\n\nLet us define $H_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) = f(x) - g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x)$.\n-   At $x=0$, we have $H_{\\mathrm{sat}}(0) = f(0) - g_{\\mathrm{sat}}(0) = \\alpha - 0 = \\alpha > 0$.\n-   As $x \\to \\infty$, $H_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) \\to 0 - V = -V < 0$.\nAgain, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one root $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{sat}} > 0$.\n\nFor uniqueness, the derivative is $H'_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) = f'(x) - g'_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x)$. Since $f'(x) < 0$ and $g'_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x) > 0$ for $x > 0$, their difference $H'_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x)$ is strictly negative. $H_{\\mathrm{sat}}(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function, which guarantees that its root is unique. This holds for all positive values of $\\alpha, K, n, V, K_M$.\n\nIn summary, for both models, a unique non-negative (specifically, positive) steady state is guaranteed for any physically realistic choice of positive parameters.\n\nTask 2: Quantitative Comparison\n\nWe are given the parameters $n=1$, $\\alpha = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM\\,min^{-1}}$, $K = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $\\gamma = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, $V = 60\\,\\mathrm{nM\\,min^{-1}}$, and $K_{M} = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFirst, we find the steady state for linear degradation, $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{lin}}$. The steady-state equation is $f(x) = g_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$. With $n=1$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x/K} = \\gamma x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha K}{K + x} = \\gamma x $$\n$$ \\alpha K = \\gamma x(K + x) = \\gamma K x + \\gamma x^2 $$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic form $ax^2+bx+c=0$:\n$$ \\gamma x^2 + \\gamma K x - \\alpha K = 0 $$\nSubstituting the parameter values:\n$$ (0.1) x^2 + (0.1)(100) x - (50)(100) = 0 $$\n$$ 0.1 x^2 + 10 x - 5000 = 0 $$\n$$ x^2 + 100 x - 50000 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ and selecting the physically meaningful positive root:\n$$ x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{lin}} = \\frac{-100 + \\sqrt{100^2 - 4(1)(-50000)}}{2} = \\frac{-100 + \\sqrt{10000 + 200000}}{2} $$\n$$ x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{lin}} = \\frac{-100 + \\sqrt{210000}}{2} = \\frac{-100 + 100\\sqrt{21}}{2} = 50(\\sqrt{21} - 1) $$\n\nNext, we find the steady state for saturated degradation, $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.
