Since we are interested in a positive fixed point where $x > 0$, this simplifies to $B - xy = 0$, which implies $x^{2}y = Bx$.\n\nNow, we substitute this result, $x^{2}y = Bx$, into the first equation:\n$$\nA - (B+1)x_{\\mathrm{ss}} + Bx_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - Bx_{\\mathrm{ss}} - x_{\\mathrm{ss}} + Bx_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the steady-state concentration for $x$:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{ss}} = A\n$$\nUsing the relation $B - xy = 0$, we can find the corresponding steady-state concentration for $y$:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{B}{x_{\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThus, the unique positive fixed point of the system is $(x_{\\mathrm{ss}}, y_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = (A, B/A)$. Since $A>0$ and $B>0$ are given, this fixed point is indeed always in the positive quadrant of the phase space.\n\nNext, to analyze the local stability of this fixed point, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, which is defined as:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -(B+1) + 2xy\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = B - 2xy\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -x^{2}\n$$\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2xy - B - 1 & x^{2} \\\\ B - 2xy & -x^{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this Jacobian matrix at the fixed point $(x_{\\mathrm{ss}}, y_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = (A, B/A)$.

This defines the critical value of $B$, which we denote as $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}(A)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(J_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = 0 \\implies B_{\\mathrm{crit}} - 1 - A^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ gives:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{crit}}(A) = 1 + A^{2}\n$$\nWe must also check the second condition, that the determinant is positive. At the bifurcation point, $\\det(J_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = A^{2}$. Since the problem states that $A>0$, it is guaranteed that $A^{2} > 0$. Therefore, the condition $\\det(J_{\\mathrm{ss}}) > 0$ is satisfied.\n\nAt $B = B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the characteristic equation for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, given by $\\lambda^{2} - \\mathrm{tr}(J_{\\mathrm{ss}})\\lambda + \\det(J_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = 0$, becomes:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} - 0 \\cdot \\lambda + A^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} = -A^{2}\n$$\nThis gives a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm iA$. As $A>0$, the imaginary part is non-zero, confirming the oscillatory nature of the instability. The real part of the eigenvalues is $\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}(J_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = \\frac{1}{2}(B - 1 - A^{2})$.

This implies that a new pair of steady states (one stable, one unstable) is created or an existing pair annihilates.
