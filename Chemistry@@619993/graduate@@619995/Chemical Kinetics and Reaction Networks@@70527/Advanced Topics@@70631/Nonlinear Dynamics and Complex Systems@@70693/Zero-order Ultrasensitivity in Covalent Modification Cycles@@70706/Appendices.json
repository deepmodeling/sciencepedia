For $R \\in (0,1)$ and $K_1 > 0$, $D(R) \\neq 0$, so $\\frac{dR}{da}$ is never zero.\nThe slope is finite provided the denominator $\\Delta(R) \\neq 0$.\nUnder these conditions, $\\frac{d^2 R}{da^2} = 0$ implies that the numerator of the expression for the second derivative must be zero.\n$$ [D(R)]^3 (\\Delta'(R)D(R) - 2\\Delta(R)D'(R)) \\;=\\; 0 $$\nSince $D(R) \\neq 0$, the condition for an inflection point simplifies to finding the value of $R$ that satisfies:\n$$ \\Delta'(R)D(R) - 2\\Delta(R)D'(R) \\;=\\; 0 $$\nThe inflection point is valid if, for the value of $R$ solving this equation, we also have $\\Delta(R) \\neq 0$.\n\n**3) Symmetric Case $K_1=K_2=1$**\n\nWe specialize the condition for inflection points to the case $K_1=K_2=1$.\nThe relevant functions become:\n$D(R) = (1+1)R - R^2 = 2R-R^2$\n$D'(R) = 2-2R$\n$\\Delta(R) = -(1+1)R^2 + 2(1)R - 1(1+1) = -2R^2+2R-2 = -2(R^2-R+1)$\n$\\Delta'(R) = -4R+2$\nThe inflection point condition $\\Delta'(R)D(R) - 2\\Delta(R)D'(R) = 0$ becomes:\n$$ (-4R+2)(2R-R^2) - 2(-2R^2+2R-2)(2-2R) \\;=\\; 0 $$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$ 2(1-2R)R(2-R) + 8(R^2-R+1)(1-R) \\;=\\; 0 $$\nDividing by $2$:\n$$ R(1-2R)(2-R) + 4(R^2-R+1)(1-R) \\;=\\; 0 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ R(2R^2-5R+2) + 4(-R^3+2R^2-2R+1) \\;=\\; 0 $$\n$$ (2R^3-5R^2+2R) + (-4R^3+8R^2-8R+4) \\;=\\; 0 $$\n$$ -2R^3+3R^2-6R+4 \\;=\\; 0 $$\nOr, multiplying by $-1$:\n$$ 2R^3 - 3R^2 + 6R - 4 \\;=\\; 0 $$\nLet $P(R) = 2R^3 - 3R^2 + 6R - 4$. We must show this polynomial has a unique root $R^*$ in the interval $(0,1)$.\nFirst, evaluate $P(R)$ at the boundaries of the interval:\n$P(0) = -4$\n$P(1) = 2 - 3 + 6 - 4 = 1$\nSince $P(0) < 0$ and $P(1) > 0$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one root $R^* \\in (0,1)$.\nNext, we examine the derivative of the polynomial, $P'(R)$:\n$$ P'(R) \\;=\\; 6R^2 - 6R + 6 \\;=\\; 6(R^2 - R + 1) $$\nBy completing the square, $R^2 - R + 1 = (R - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{4} + 1 = (R - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{3}{4}$. This term is strictly positive for all real $R$. Thus, $P'(R) > 0$ for all $R$.\nSince $P(R)$ is a strictly increasing function, it can cross the R-axis at most once. Therefore, there is exactly one real root $R^*$, and it lies in the interval $(0,1)$.\nThe validity condition $\\Delta(R) \\neq 0$ is satisfied because $\\Delta(R) = -2(R^2-R+1) = -2((R-\\frac{1}{2})^2+\\frac{3}{4})$, which is never zero.\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate $a^*$ corresponding to this inflection point $R^*$.\nFor $K_1=K_2=1$, the GK equation is $a = \\frac{(1+R)(1-R)}{(2-R)R} = \\frac{1-R^2}{2R-R^2}$.\nWe must find the root $R^*$ of $2R^3 - 3R^2 + 6R - 4 = 0$ numerically. Using Newton's method or a numerical solver, we find an accurate approximation:\n$$ R^* \\approx 0.81891845 $$\nNow we substitute this value into the expression for $a^*$:\n$$ a^* \\;=\\; \\frac{1 - (R^*)^2}{2R^* - (R^*)^2} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{1 - (0.81891845)^2}{2(0.81891845) - (0.81891845)^2} $$\n$$ a^* \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{1 - 0.67062744}{1.6378369 - 0.67062744} \\;=\\; \\frac{0.32937256}{0.96720946} \\;\\approx\\; 0.3405399... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $0.3405$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3405}$$", "id": "2694559"}]}
