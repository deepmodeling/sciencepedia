The feed contains only $X$ at concentration $x_{f}$, while $y_{f} = 0$ and $z_{f} = 0$. The dilution rate is $D$.

It is based on established principles of chemical reaction engineering and dynamical systems theory. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is internally consistent and formalizable. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the dynamics of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is the component mass balance, which states that the rate of accumulation of a species within the reactor volume is equal to the rate of inflow minus the rate of outflow plus the net rate of formation by chemical reaction. For a generic species $i$ with concentration $C_i$ in a system with constant volume and volumetric flow rate, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = D(C_{i,f} - C_i) + \\mathcal{R}_i\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the dilution rate (volumetric flow rate divided by reactor volume), $C_{i,f}$ is the feed concentration of species $i$, and $\\mathcal{R}_i$ is the net rate of production of species $i$ per unit volume.\n\n1) Derivation of the dynamical system.\n\nWe apply the general balance equation to the three species $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, with concentrations $x$, $y$, and $z$. The feed concentrations are given as $x_f$, $y_f=0$, and $z_f=0$. The reactions are $X + Y \\rightarrow 2Y$ with rate $r_1 = k_1 x y$, and $Y \\rightarrow Z$ with rate $r_2 = k_2 y$.\n\nFor species $X$:\nThe net rate of production is $\\mathcal{R}_x = -r_1 = -k_1 x y$. The mass balance is:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\frac{dx}{dt} = D(x_f - x) - k_1 x y\n$$\n\nFor species $Y$:\nIn the first reaction, one mole of $Y$ is consumed and two are produced, for a net production of one mole of $Y$. The rate is $+r_1 = k_1 x y$. In the second reaction, one mole of $Y$ is consumed, with rate $-r_2 = -k_2 y$. The net rate of production is $\\mathcal{R}_y = r_1 - r_2 = k_1 x y - k_2 y$.

The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}^\\star$ are the eigenvalues of the upper-left $2 \\times 2$ subblock, which we denote $\\mathbf{A}$, and the single element $J_{33}^\\star$.\nOne eigenvalue is immediately $\\lambda_3 = J_{33}^\\star = -1.2$. This is a real, negative eigenvalue, implying strong contraction in the direction of its corresponding eigenvector. Since the dynamics of $x$ and $y$ are independent of $z$ (as seen by the zeros in the upper right of $\\mathbf{J}$), the $z$-direction is decoupled from the $(x,y)$-subspace dynamics. Trajectories are exponentially attracted towards the $z=0$ plane if we consider perturbations from it, but here it describes how perturbations in $z$ decay while the system evolves in $x$ and $y$. Specifically, the dynamics of $z$ are slave to the dynamics of $y$, and the term $-Dz$ provides a stable, contracting mode.\n\nThe remaining two eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, are the eigenvalues of the subblock governing the dynamics in the $(x,y)$-plane:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1.6 & -4.8 \\\\ 0.4 & 2.7 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe analyze these eigenvalues using the trace and determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -1.6 + 2.7 = 1.1\n$$\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = (-1.6)(2.7) - (-4.8)(0.4) = -4.32 + 1.92 = -2.4\n$$\nThe discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is $\\Delta = (\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}))^2 - 4\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = (1.1)^2 - 4(-2.4) = 1.21 + 9.6 = 10.81 > 0$. Since $\\Delta > 0$, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are real and distinct.\nSince their product, $\\det(\\mathbf{A})$, is negative ($-2.4$), one eigenvalue must be positive and the other must be negative. Thus, the point $(x^\\star, y^\\star)$ is a saddle point within the $(x,y)$-subspace.\nLet $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2 < 0$. We have $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 1.1 > 0$, confirming that the magnitude of the positive eigenvalue is greater than that of the negative one.\n\nIn summary, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}^\\star$ have the signs: one positive ($\\lambda_1 > 0$), two negative ($\\lambda_2 < 0, \\lambda_3 < 0$).\n\nImplications for the dynamics:\n- **Stretching**: The positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 > 0$ indicates that an infinitesimal perturbation in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector will grow exponentially at a rate $\\exp(\\lambda_1 t)$. This local instability and rapid divergence of nearby trajectories is the defining characteristic of sensitivity to initial conditions, a necessary ingredient for chaotic dynamics.\n- **Contraction**: The two negative eigenvalues $\\lambda_2 < 0$ and $\\lambda_3 < 0$ indicate contraction along two other directions in phase space. Perturbations along these directions decay exponentially.\n- **Phase-space Volume**: For a strange attractor to exist, the system must be dissipative, meaning that volumes in phase space must contract on average. The instantaneous rate of volume change is given by the trace of the Jacobian. The sum of the eigenvalues is $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) + \\lambda_3 = 1.1 + (-1.2) = -0.1$. Since the sum is negative, there is local volume contraction at this point. This combination of stretching in one direction while the overall volume contracts is the fundamental mechanism for creating the fractal structure of a strange attractor. Trajectories are stretched apart and then folded back onto the attractor, which occupies a set of zero volume in the three-dimensional phase space.\n\n4) Computation of the instantaneous rate of change of phase-space volume.\n\nThe local rate of change of an infinitesimal phase-space volume element is given by the divergence of the vector field, which is equal to the trace of the Jacobian matrix, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{J})$. This quantity is also the sum of the eigenvalues.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{J})\n$$\nUsing the evaluated Jacobian $\\mathbf{J}^\\star$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{J}^\\star) = J_{11}^\\star + J_{22}^\\star + J_{33}^\\star = -1.6 + 2.7 + (-1.2) = 1.1 - 1.2 = -0.1\n$$\nThe units of the trace are the units of the diagonal elements, which are $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The problem asks for the answer rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThe value is $-0.1000\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The core issue is the interaction between the system's dynamics, characterized by a wide range of time scales (stiffness), and the properties of the numerical integrator used. A valid approach must be stable for the entire spectrum of the Jacobian matrix $J(x)$ while accurately capturing the slow dynamics on the attractor that determine $\\lambda_{\\max}$. We will now evaluate each statement based on the fundamental principles of numerical analysis for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\n\nThe system is given by $\\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t))$, where $f(x) = S v(x)$. Stiffness arises when the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of the Jacobian $J(x) = \\partial f / \\partial x$ are widely separated in magnitude. The fast dynamics correspond to eigenvalues with large negative real parts, i.e., $|\\Re(\\lambda_i)| \\gg 1$. An explicit numerical method with step size $h$ is stable only if $h\\lambda_i$ lies within its stability region for all $i$. For stiff systems, this forces $h$ to be prohibitively small, dictated by the fastest time scale, even after the fast transients have decayed.\n\nThe maximal Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is determined by the long-term growth rate of a perturbation vector $\\delta x$, governed by the variational equation $\\dot{\\delta x}(t) = J(x(t))\\delta x(t)$. Since the variational equation is driven by the Jacobian of the original system, it inherits the stiffness.

In a stiff regime with $\\kappa \\gg 1$, simply tightening the error tolerance of an explicit adaptive Runge–Kutta method guarantees monotone convergence of the estimated $\\lambda_{\\max}$, because consistency of order $p$ ensures that trajectory and tangent errors shrink uniformly in time.\n\nThis statement is profoundly incorrect.\nFirst, for an explicit method, the stability requirement, not accuracy, dictates the step size in a stiff regime. Tightening the tolerance forces the method to take smaller steps, but it does not change the fundamental deficiency of the method's bounded stability region. The simulation cost will become astronomical for long-time integration.\nSecond, the concept of \"uniform convergence\" of a trajectory is ill-defined for a chaotic system. Due to sensitivity to initial conditions, any two nearby trajectories (such as a true trajectory and a numerical one) diverge exponentially at a rate given by $\\lambda_{\\max}$. A consistency of order $p$ guarantees only that the *local* truncation error is of order $O(h^{p+1})$, which provides no guarantee of global error behavior over the infinite time horizon required for $\\lambda_{\\max}$ calculation. The error does not \"shrink uniformly in time\"; it is expected to grow. While shadowing theorems may guarantee the existence of a true trajectory near the numerical one for some time, this is not guaranteed for all systems or all numerical methods. Monotone convergence of the estimated $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is not a guaranteed outcome; numerical instabilities can easily introduce spurious dynamics that corrupt the estimate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Using an $L$-stable implicit integrator, such as a Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) or singly diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (SDIRK), to advance both the base ODE and the variational equation, combined with periodic orthonormalization via the orthonormal–triangular (QR) method of the tangent vectors, reduces contamination by strongly stable fast modes and yields more reliable $\\lambda_{\\max}$ estimates in stiff chaos.\n\nThis statement is correct and describes the standard, state-of-the-art technique.\nAn integrator is A-stable if its stability region contains the entire left-half of the complex plane, $\\mathbb{C}^-$. This allows the step size $h$ to be chosen based on the accuracy requirements of the slow dynamics, unconstrained by the large eigenvalues of the stiff components. $L$-stability is a stronger property, requiring that the method's stability function $R(z)$ satisfies $\\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} R(z) = 0$. This is highly desirable for stiff systems as it ensures that the fast, strongly stable modes are effectively damped by the numerical method, preventing them from causing oscillations or instabilities. BDF methods (of order up to $6$) and many SDIRK methods possess these properties.\nSince the variational equation $\\dot{\\delta x} = J(x) \\delta x$ is also stiff, it too must be integrated with such a method. To compute the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, one must track a set of $n$ perturbation vectors. These vectors must be periodically re-orthonormalized to counteract their tendency to align with the direction of maximal expansion. The Gram-Schmidt or, more robustly, the QR decomposition method is used for this. This entire combination of techniques—an L-stable integrator for both the state and variational equations, plus QR re-orthonormalization—is the robust and accepted procedure for computing Lyapunov exponents in stiff systems.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. Constructing a Poincaré section by increasing the sampling interval $\\Delta t$ substantially (so that only slow dynamics are observed) improves accuracy in stiff chaotic systems, because fast decays are filtered out and aliasing is reduced.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. First, a Poincaré section is a specific construction involving intersections with a surface in phase space, not simply sampling at fixed time intervals $\\Delta t$. What is described is stroboscopic sampling. Second, increasing the sampling interval $\\Delta t$ does not improve accuracy; it destroys it. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, to reconstruct a signal, one must sample at a rate at least twice its highest frequency component. Chaotic systems have a broad, continuous power spectrum. If $\\Delta t$ is too large relative to the characteristic time scales of the motion on the attractor, severe aliasing will occur. This folding of high-frequency dynamics into low frequencies will completely distort the geometry of the attractor observed in the sample points. This does not \"reduce\" aliasing; it is the very definition of aliasing. The fast transient decays occur as the trajectory approaches the attractor, but once on the attractor, the dynamics themselves have characteristic time scales that must be respected by the sampling.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Proper nondimensionalization and scaling of variables to balance magnitudes in $x$ and to rescale time can reduce stiffness (improve conditioning of $J(x)$), which improves both base-flow integration and robustness of MLE estimation.\n\nThis statement is correct. It is a fundamental principle of good practice in scientific computing.\nNondimensionalization consolidates physical parameters into a minimal set of dimensionless groups, clarifying the intrinsic time and concentration scales of the system. Scaling variables, for example, such that their typical values on the attractor are of order unity ($O(1)$), is crucial. If different components of $x$ have vastly different magnitudes (e.g., $x_1 \\sim 10^{-2}$, $x_2 \\sim 10^{-9}$), the rows and columns of the Jacobian matrix $J(x)$ will be poorly scaled. This leads to a large condition number, which can degrade the performance and accuracy of linear algebra routines central to implicit integrators and can confuse the error estimators of adaptive step-size controllers. While scaling cannot remove *intrinsic* stiffness due to a true separation of time scales, it can significantly reduce or eliminate *artificial* stiffness arising from a poor choice of units or variables. An improved conditioning of $J(x)$ makes the numerical problem easier to solve for any method, leading to more efficient and reliable integration of both the state and the variational equations, and thus a more robust estimate of $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nE. For dissipative chemical kinetics, symplectic integrators are preferred to preserve strange attractor geometry and guarantee accurate Lyapunov exponents, because they conserve phase-space volume.\n\nThis statement is incorrect and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of both dissipative systems and symplectic methods. Symplectic integrators are specifically designed for Hamiltonian systems, which are conservative. The defining property of a Hamiltonian system is the conservation of energy and, more generally, the preservation of the symplectic two-form, which implies the conservation of phase-space volume.\nThe problem states the system is *dissipative*. By definition, a dissipative system does not conserve phase-space volume; it contracts it. A strange attractor, the hallmark of dissipative chaos, has zero volume in the full phase space. The sum of the Lyapunov exponents of a dissipative system must be negative, reflecting this volume contraction. Applying a method designed to conserve a quantity that the true system is actively dissipating is illogical and will lead to qualitatively wrong dynamics. It will not preserve the geometry of the strange attractor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nF. Linearly implicit Rosenbrock–W methods or BDF schemes that reuse or recycle Jacobian factorizations to propagate both the state and its sensitivities (variational equations) are effective remedies for stiffness in Lyapunov exponent computation, because they stabilize fast contracting modes without overdamping expanding directions on the slow manifold.\n\nThis statement is correct and describes an efficient implementation of the principles from statement B.\nRosenbrock–W methods are a class of linearly implicit methods that are A-stable or L-stable, making them well-suited for stiff problems. They require the solution of a linear system involving the Jacobian at each stage but avoid solving nonlinear systems of equations, making them computationally attractive.\nThe key to efficiency in computing Lyapunov exponents for stiff systems is to integrate the state ODE and the variational ODEs together. An implicit step for the state $x_{n+1}$ from $x_n$ requires forming and often factorizing a matrix like $(I - \\gamma h J(x_n))$. The variational equations, $\\dot{Y} = J(x) Y$, are linear in the sensitivity matrix $Y$. When an implicit method is applied to them, it results in a linear system involving the *same* Jacobian matrix $J(x_n)$. Therefore, the expensive computation of the Jacobian and its LU factorization can be performed once and then reused for both the state update and the update of all the sensitivity vectors. This \"recycling\" of Jacobian information drastically reduces the computational cost per step. These methods correctly stabilize the fast modes (due to L-stability) while accurately tracking the dynamics on the slow manifold, including any positive, zero, or slowly decaying modes, thus enabling an accurate computation of the full Lyapunov spectrum.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{B, D, F}\n$$", "id": "2679761"}]}
