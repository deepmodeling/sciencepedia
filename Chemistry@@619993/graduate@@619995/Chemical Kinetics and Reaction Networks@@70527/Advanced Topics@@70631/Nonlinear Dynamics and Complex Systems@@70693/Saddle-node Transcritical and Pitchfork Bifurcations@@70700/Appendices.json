Furthermore, the function $f(x, r)$ exhibits odd symmetry with respect to $x$, a property defined by the relation $f(-x, r) = -f(x, r)$ for all $x$ and $r$.\n\nAs the parameter $r$ is varied through the critical value $r=0$, the equilibrium point at $x=0$ is observed to undergo a local bifurcation. Given the stringent constraint of odd symmetry, which one of the following types of local bifurcations is impossible for the equilibrium at $x=0$ to undergo at $r=0$?\n\nA.

We analyze which local bifurcations of the equilibrium at $x=0$ can occur at $r=0$ under the symmetry constraint.\n\nStep 1: Taylor expansion under odd symmetry.\nBecause $f$ is $C^{k}$ (assumed smooth) and odd in $x$, its Taylor expansion in $x$ about $x=0$ for $r$ near $0$ contains only odd powers of $x$:\n$$\nf(x,r)=a_{1}(r)\\,x+a_{3}(r)\\,x^{3}+a_{5}(r)\\,x^{5}+\\cdots,\n$$\nwhere each $a_{2j+1}(r)$ is smooth in $r$. In particular, there are no constant terms in $x$ and no even powers of $x$.\n\nStep 2: Condition for a local bifurcation at $x=0$.\nA local bifurcation of the equilibrium at $x=0$ as $r$ passes through $0$ requires that the linearization at the equilibrium have a zero eigenvalue at $r=0$, i.e.,\n$$\nf_{x}(0,0)=a_{1}(0)=0,\n$$\nand generically that $a_{1}'(0)\\neq 0$ so that the eigenvalue crosses through zero as $r$ varies. On the one-dimensional center manifold (which is the $x$-axis here), the reduced normal form to lowest nontrivial order is\n$$\n\\dot{x}=a_{1}(r)\\,x+a_{3}(0)\\,x^{3}.\n$$\nLet $\\mu=a_{1}(r)$ with $\\mu\\approx a_{1}'(0)\\,r$ and let $b=a_{3}(0)$. Then the local normal form becomes\n$$\n\\dot{x}=\\mu x+b x^{3}.\n$$\nThis is the standard pitchfork normal form. If $b<0$, the pitchfork is supercritical; if $b>0$, the pitchfork is subcritical. Both are compatible with the odd symmetry because the right-hand side is an odd function of $x$ for all $\\mu$.\n\nStep 3: Impossibility of a saddle-node at $x=0$ under odd symmetry.\nA saddle-node bifurcation at the equilibrium $x=0$ has the canonical local normal form\n$$\n\\dot{x}=\\mu\\pm x^{2},\n$$\nafter smooth changes of variables and parameters. This right-hand side is an even function of $x$ (it includes a constant-in-$x$ term $\\mu$ and an even power $x^{2}$). Therefore, it cannot satisfy the odd symmetry $f(-x,r)=-f(x,r)$ for any nonzero $\\mu$ and hence is incompatible with the imposed odd symmetry at all $r$. More generally, the Taylor series enforced by odd symmetry excludes both constant and even-power terms in $x$, so a saddle-node bifurcation at $x=0$ is impossible.\n\nConclusion: Supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations are possible; a saddle-node bifurcation at $x=0$ is impossible under the odd symmetry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2197614"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract principles to a concrete chemical application, this practice examines the Schlögl model, a canonical example of autocatalysis and bistability in a chemical reaction network. A saddle-node bifurcation is the fundamental mathematical mechanism that gives rise to bistability, where a system can exist in one of two distinct stable states. This problem challenges you to derive the conditions for this bifurcation directly from the underlying mass-action kinetics, connecting the abstract concept of a non-hyperbolic equilibrium to a tangible algebraic condition on the system's rate constants and reservoir concentrations [@problem_id:2673231].", "problem": "Consider the chemostatted autocatalytic reaction network (the Schlögl model) governed by mass-action kinetics with a single dynamic species $X$ and two chemostatted reservoirs $A$ and $B$ held at fixed concentrations $A$ and $B$:\n$A + 2X \\xrightarrow{k_1} 3X$, $3X \\xrightarrow{k_2} A + 2X$, $B \\xrightarrow{k_3} X$, $X \\xrightarrow{k_4} B$, where $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$ are positive rate constants.

It requires the application of fundamental principles from chemical kinetics and dynamical systems theory to a canonical model. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is described by four chemical reactions:\n1. $A + 2X \\xrightarrow{k_1} 3X$\n2. $3X \\xrightarrow{k_2} A + 2X$\n3. $B \\xrightarrow{k_3} X$\n4. $X \\xrightarrow{k_4} B$\n\nThe concentrations of species $A$ and $B$ are constant. Let $x$ denote the concentration of the dynamic species $X$. The law of mass action dictates the rate of change of $x$. The net rate of production of $X$ is the sum of the rates of the reactions producing $X$ minus the sum of the rates of the reactions consuming $X$.\n\nFrom reaction $1$, the production rate of $X$ is $k_1 [A] [X]^2 = k_1 A x^2$.

At the bifurcation point, the system's state $x_c$ corresponds to a non-hyperbolic equilibrium. This requires that the value of the function defining the dynamics is zero, and its derivative with respect to the state variable is also zero.\nThe two conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation are:\n1. $p(x_c) = 0$\n2. $p'(x_c) = \\frac{d}{dx} p(x) \\Big|_{x=x_c} = 0$\n\nCalculating the derivative of $p(x)$:\n$$\np'(x) = -3k_2 x^2 + 2k_1 A x - k_4\n$$\nThe simultaneous satisfaction of $p(x_c) = 0$ and $p'(x_c) = 0$ means that the polynomial $p(x)$ has a repeated root at $x_c$. The algebraic condition for a polynomial to have one or more repeated roots is that its discriminant must be zero. We now compute the discriminant of the cubic polynomial $p(x)$.\n\nFor a general cubic polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta = b^2 c^2 - 4ac^3 - 4b^3 d - 27a^2 d^2 + 18abcd\n$$\nWe identify the coefficients of $p(x)$ with the general form:\n- $a = -k_2$\n- $b = k_1 A$\n- $c = -k_4$\n- $d = k_3 B$\n\nWe substitute these coefficients into the discriminant formula term by term.\nThe first term is $b^2 c^2$:\n$$\n(k_1 A)^2 (-k_4)^2 = k_1^2 A^2 k_4^2\n$$\nThe second term is $-4ac^3$:\n$$\n-4(-k_2)(-k_4)^3 = -4(-k_2)(-k_4^3) = -4k_2 k_4^3\n$$\nThe third term is $-4b^3 d$:\n$$\n-4(k_1 A)^3 (k_3 B) = -4k_1^3 A^3 k_3 B\n$$\nThe fourth term is $-27a^2 d^2$:\n$$\n-27(-k_2)^2 (k_3 B)^2 = -27k_2^2 k_3^2 B^2\n$$\nThe fifth term is $18abcd$:\n$$\n18(-k_2)(k_1 A)(-k_4)(k_3 B) = 18 k_1 A k_2 B k_3 k_4\n$$\nSumming these terms yields the discriminant polynomial $\\Delta$ in terms of the system parameters.
