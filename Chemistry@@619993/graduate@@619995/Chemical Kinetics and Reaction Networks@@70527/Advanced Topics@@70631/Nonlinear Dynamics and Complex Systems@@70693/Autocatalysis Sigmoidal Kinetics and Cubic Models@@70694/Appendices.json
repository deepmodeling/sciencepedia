The problem states the system is governed by the elementary reaction:\n$$A + X \\xrightarrow{k} 2X$$\nAccording to the law of mass action for an elementary reaction, the reaction rate, $r$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants. Let $a(t)$ and $x(t)$ be the concentrations of species $A$ and $X$, respectively. The rate is given by:\n$$r = k a(t) x(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive rate constant.\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of each species is determined by the reaction stoichiometry. Species $A$ is consumed in the reaction, so its concentration decreases at a rate $r$. Species $X$ is both consumed (one molecule) and produced (two molecules), resulting in a net production of one molecule of $X$. Thus, its concentration increases at a rate $r$. This gives us the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = -k a(t) x(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = k a(t) x(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies a batch reactor with no inflow or outflow. This implies a conservation law. By summing the two differential equations, we observe:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} + \\frac{dx}{dt} = -k a(t) x(t) + k a(t) x(t) = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (a(t) + x(t)) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to time yields that the sum of the concentrations is a constant:\n$$\na(t) + x(t) = C\n$$\nWe can determine the constant $C$ from the initial conditions, $a(0) = a_{0}$ and $x(0) = x_{0}$.\n$$\nC = a(0) + x(0) = a_{0} + x_{0}\n$$\nLet us denote this total concentration as $M = a_{0} + x_{0}$. This conservation law allows us to express the concentration of $A$ in terms of the concentration of $X$:\n$$\na(t) = M - x(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we can derive the single kinetic equation for $x(t)$ by substituting the expression for $a(t)$ into the rate equation for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = k (M - x(t)) x(t)\n$$\nThis is the logistic differential equation, which is known to produce sigmoidal (S-shaped) solution curves, characteristic of autocatalytic growth.\n\nThe next step is to non-dimensionalize this equation. We introduce dimensionless variables for concentration, $u$, and time, $\\tau$. Let $x = x_{\\mathrm{char}} u$ and $t = t_{\\mathrm{char}} \\tau$, where $x_{\\mathrm{char}}$ is a characteristic concentration and $t_{\\mathrm{char}}$ is a characteristic time. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{dx}{du}\\frac{du}{d\\tau}\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = x_{\\mathrm{char}} \\frac{du}{d\\tau} \\frac{1}{t_{\\mathrm{char}}}$. Substituting these into the ODE for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{char}}}{t_{\\mathrm{char}}} \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = k (M - x_{\\mathrm{char}} u) (x_{\\mathrm{char}} u)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = k t_{\\mathrm{char}} x_{\\mathrm{char}} \\left( \\frac{M}{x_{\\mathrm{char}}} - u \\right) u\n$$\nTo obtain a parameter-free ODE, we must choose $x_{\\mathrm{char}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{char}}$ to eliminate the constants. A natural choice for the characteristic concentration is the total constant concentration $M = a_{0} + x_{0}$. Let $x_{\\mathrm{char}} = M$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = k t_{\\mathrm{char}} M (1 - u) u\n$$\nTo make the equation parameter-free, we set the group of constants to unity: $k t_{\\mathrm{char}} M = 1$. This defines the characteristic time:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{char}} = \\frac{1}{kM} = \\frac{1}{k(a_{0} + x_{0})}\n$$\nWith these choices for $x_{\\mathrm{char}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{char}}$, the dimensionless state equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u)\n$$\nThe dimensionless initial concentration, $u_{0}$, is found from the initial condition $x(0) = x_{0}$:\n$$\nu(0) = u_{0} = \\frac{x(0)}{x_{\\mathrm{char}}} = \\frac{x_{0}}{M} = \\frac{x_{0}}{a_{0} + x_{0}}\n$$\nWe must now solve the initial-value problem:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u), \\quad u(0) = u_{0}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{u(1 - u)} = d\\tau\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state $(\\tau=0, u=u_{0})$ to a general state $(\\tau, u(\\tau))$:\n$$\n\\int_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)} \\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{\\tilde{u}(1 - \\tilde{u})} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} d\\tilde{\\tau}\n$$\nThe integral on the right is simply $\\tau$. For the integral on the left, we use partial fraction decomposition:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}(1 - \\tilde{u})} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\tilde{u}}\n$$\nSo the left-hand side integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\tilde{u}} \\right) d\\tilde{u} = \\left[ \\ln|\\tilde{u}| - \\ln|1 - \\tilde{u}| \\right]_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)} = \\left[ \\ln\\left|\\frac{\\tilde{u}}{1 - \\tilde{u}}\\right| \\right]_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)}\n$$\nSince $x_{0} > 0$ and $a_{0} > 0$, we have $0 < x_{0} < M$, which implies $0 < u_{0} < 1$.
