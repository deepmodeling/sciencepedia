It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete derivation. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system is defined by two chemical reactions involving two species, $X$ and $Y$:\n1. $X + Y \\xrightarrow{k_1} 2Y$\n2. $Y \\xrightarrow{k_2} X$\n\nThe rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ are given as positive real numbers. We assume deterministic mass-action kinetics in a well-mixed system. Let $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ represent the concentrations of species $X$ and $Y$ at time $t$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we derive the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern the dynamics of the concentrations. The rate of the first reaction, $v_1$, is proportional to the product of the reactant concentrations, $v_1 = k_1 X(t) Y(t)$. The rate of the second reaction, $v_2$, is proportional to its reactant concentration, $v_2 = k_2 Y(t)$.\n\nFor species $X$, it is consumed in the first reaction and produced in the second. The net rate of change of $X(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = -v_1 + v_2 = -k_1 X Y + k_2 Y\n$$\nFor species $Y$, its net production in the first reaction is one molecule (one is consumed, two are produced), and it is consumed in the second reaction. The net rate of change of $Y(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = +v_1 - v_2 = k_1 X Y - k_2 Y\n$$\nThis constitutes the system of ODEs for $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$.\n\nNext, we identify the conserved quantity. By summing the two differential equations, we observe:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (X + Y) = \\frac{dX}{dt} + \\frac{dY}{dt} = (-k_1 X Y + k_2 Y) + (k_1 X Y - k_2 Y) = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the total concentration, $X(t) + Y(t)$, is a constant over time. This constant is determined by the initial conditions. The problem states that $X(0) + Y(0) = T$, where $T > 0$. Therefore, for all $t \\ge 0$, the conservation law is:\n$$\nX(t) + Y(t) = T\n$$\nThe conserved quantity is the sum of the concentrations, $X+Y$.\n\nNow, we determine the steady states of the system. At steady state, all time derivatives are zero. Let the steady-state concentrations be denoted by $X^{\\ast}$ and $Y^{\\ast}$. We must solve the system:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = -k_1 X^{\\ast} Y^{\\ast} + k_2 Y^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = k_1 X^{\\ast} Y^{\\ast} - k_2 Y^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nThese two equations are linearly dependent. We only need to solve one, for instance, the first one:\n$$\nY^{\\ast} (-k_1 X^{\\ast} + k_2) = 0\n$$\nThis equation presents two possibilities for the steady state:\nCase 1: $Y^{\\ast} = 0$. Using the conservation law $X^{\\ast} + Y^{\\ast} = T$, we find $X^{\\ast} = T$. This gives a steady state $(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}) = (T, 0)$. This is a boundary steady state, as one concentration is zero.\n\nCase 2: $-k_1 X^{\\ast} + k_2 = 0$. Since $k_1 > 0$, we can solve for $X^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nX^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1}\n$$\nAgain, using the conservation law, we find the corresponding steady-state concentration for $Y$:\n$$\nY^{\\ast} = T - X^{\\ast} = T - \\frac{k_2}{k_1}\n$$\nThis gives a second steady state $(X^{\\ast}, Y^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{k_2}{k_1}, T - \\frac{k_2}{k_1})$.\n\nThe problem requires us to demonstrate Absolute Concentration Robustness (ACR) in $X$ for any *positive* steady state. A positive steady state is one where both $X^{\\ast} > 0$ and $Y^{\\ast} > 0$.\nThe first steady state, $(T, 0)$, is not a positive steady state because $Y^{\\ast} = 0$.\nThe second steady state, $(\\frac{k_2}{k_1}, T - \\frac{k_2}{k_1})$, is positive if and only if both components are positive.\nThe condition $X^{\\ast} > 0$ requires $\\frac{k_2}{k_1} > 0$. Since we are given $k_1 > 0$ and $k_2 > 0$, this condition is always satisfied.\nThe condition $Y^{\\ast} > 0$ requires $T - \\frac{k_2}{k_1} > 0$, which simplifies to $T > \\frac{k_2}{k_1}$.\n\nTherefore, a positive steady state exists if and only if the total concentration $T$ is greater than the ratio $\\frac{k_2}{k_1}$.\nWhen this positive steady state exists, the steady-state concentration of $X$ is $X^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1}$. This expression for $X^{\\ast}$ depends only on the rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$. It is independent of the total concentration $T$, and by extension, it is independent of the specific non-negative initial concentrations $X(0)$ and $Y(0)$ as long as their sum is $T$. This property is precisely the definition of Absolute Concentration Robustness. The concentration of $X$ is robustly maintained at the value $\\frac{k_2}{k_1}$ regardless of the total amount of material in the system, provided there is enough material ($T > \\frac{k_2}{k_1}$) for the system to support a positive concentration of $Y$.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of this positive steady state is $T > \\frac{k_2}{k_1}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the robust steady-state concentration of $X$. As proven, this is the value of $X^{\\ast}$ in the positive steady state.\nThe robust steady-state concentration of $X$ is $X^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_2}{k_1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_2}{k_1}}\n$$", "id": "2671161"}, {"introduction": "Robustness is not limited to maintaining constant concentrations; it can also apply to the preservation of complex dynamic behaviors.

Derivation of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) and the steady-state cubic equation.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rates of the four elementary reactions are:\n- Forward reaction 1: $v_{1} = k_{1} [A] [X]^{2} = k_{1} a x^{2}$\n- Reverse reaction 1: $v_{2} = k_{2} [X]^{3} = k_{2} x^{3}$\n- Forward reaction 2: $v_{3} = k_{3} [X] = k_{3} x$\n- Reverse reaction 2: $v_{4} = k_{4} [B] = k_{4} b$\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of $X$, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, is determined by the stoichiometry of the reactions. The net production of $X$ in the first pair of reactions is $(3-2)X$, and in the second pair is $(0-1)X$. Therefore, the ODE for $x(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (v_{1} - v_{2}) + (v_{4} - v_{3}) = (k_{1} a x^{2} - k_{2} x^{3}) + (k_{4} b - k_{3} x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -k_{2} x^{3} + k_{1} a x^{2} - k_{3} x + k_{4} b\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration of $X$ is constant, so $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$. The steady-state concentrations, which we denote by $x$, are the roots of the algebraic equation:\n$$\n-k_{2} x^{3} + k_{1} a x^{2} - k_{3} x + k_{4} b = 0\n$$\nTo obtain the requested cubic form, we divide the entire equation by $k_{2}$, which is given to be positive ($k_{2} > 0$):\n$$\n-x^{3} + \\left(\\frac{k_{1} a}{k_{2}}\\right) x^{2} - \\left(\\frac{k_{3}}{k_{2}}\\right) x + \\left(\\frac{k_{4} b}{k_{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nBy comparing this with the target form $-x^{3} + \\alpha x^{2} - \\beta x + \\gamma = 0$, we identify the dimensionless parameters as:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{k_{1} a}{k_{2}}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{k_{3}}{k_{2}}, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{k_{4} b}{k_{2}}\n$$\nSince all rate constants $k_{i}$ and concentrations $a, b$ are positive, the parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are also positive.\n\n2. Conditions for three distinct, physically meaningful steady states.\n\nLet $f(x) = -x^{3} + \\alpha x^{2} - \\beta x + \\gamma$. The steady states are the roots of $f(x) = 0$. For a cubic polynomial with a negative leading coefficient to have three distinct real roots, it must possess a local minimum and a local maximum, and the value at the minimum must be negative while the value at the maximum must be positive.\n\nThe locations of the extrema are found by solving $f'(x) = 0$:\n$$\nf'(x) = -3x^{2} + 2\\alpha x - \\beta = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are the critical points:\n$$\nx_{\\pm} = \\frac{-2\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\alpha)^{2} - 4(-3)(-\\beta)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{\\alpha \\mp \\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta}}{3}\n$$\nFor two distinct real critical points to exist, the discriminant of $f'(x)$ must be positive: $4\\alpha^{2} - 12\\beta > 0$, which simplifies to $\\alpha^{2} > 3\\beta$.\n\nLet's identify the nature of these extrema via the second derivative, $f''(x) = -6x + 2\\alpha$.\n- At $x_{+} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta}}{3}$, $f''(x_{+}) = -2\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta} < 0$, so $x_{+}$ is a local maximum.\n- At $x_{-} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta}}{3}$, $f''(x_{-}) = 2\\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta} > 0$, so $x_{-}$ is a local minimum.\n\nThe condition for three distinct real roots is $f(x_{-}) < 0$ and $f(x_{+}) > 0$.\n\nFor these steady states to be physically meaningful, their concentrations must be non-negative.\nSince $\\alpha, \\beta > 0$ and $\\alpha^{2} > 3\\beta$, we have $\\alpha > \\sqrt{3\\beta}$. This implies $\\alpha > \\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta}$, so $x_{-} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\sqrt{\\alpha^{2} - 3\\beta}}{3} > 0$. Both critical points lie at positive concentrations.\nThe value of the function at $x=0$ is $f(0) = \\gamma$. Since we assume $b>0$, we have $\\gamma > 0$. The roots of $f(x) = 0$ are the steady states $x_{ss}$. The product of the roots is given by Viète's formulas as $x_1 x_2 x_3 = -(\\gamma / -1) = \\gamma > 0$. If all three roots are real, this means either all are positive, or one is positive and two are negative.\nGiven that $f(0)=\\gamma>0$ and the local minimum $x_{-}$ is at a positive concentration, if $f(x_{-}) < 0$, the graph must cross the positive x-axis at least once before $x_{-}$. Therefore, the smallest root $x_1$ must be positive. It follows that all three roots must be positive. Let them be $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < x_{3}$. They must be ordered relative to the extrema as $x_1 < x_{-} < x_2 < x_{+} < x_3$.\n\nStability is determined by the sign of $f'(x_{ss})$: stable if $f'(x_{ss}) < 0$, unstable if $f'(x_{ss}) > 0$.\n- For $x_1 \\in (0, x_{-})$, $f'(x_1) < 0$ $\\implies$ stable steady state.\n- For $x_2 \\in (x_{-}, x_{+})$, $f'(x_2) > 0$ $\\implies$ unstable steady state.\n- For $x_3 \\in (x_{+}, \\infty)$, $f'(x_3) < 0$ $\\implies$ stable steady state.\nThis configuration of two stable steady states separated by an unstable one constitutes bistability.\n\n3. Calculation of the saddle-node bifurcation locus.\n\nThe boundary of the region with three real steady states corresponds to the merging of two roots.
