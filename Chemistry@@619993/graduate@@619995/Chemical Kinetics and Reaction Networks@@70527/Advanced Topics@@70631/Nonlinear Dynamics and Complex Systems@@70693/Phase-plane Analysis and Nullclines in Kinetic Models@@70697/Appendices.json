The statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of ambiguity. A solution can be constructed directly from the principles of mass-action kinetics and stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we address task 1 by constructing the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern the concentrations $a(t)$, $b(t)$, and $c(t)$ of species $A$, $B$, and $C$. According to the law of mass action, the rates of the individual reaction steps are:\n- Forward reaction $A \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} B$: rate $r_1 = k_1 a(t)$\n- Reverse reaction $B \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} A$: rate $r_{-1} = k_{-1} b(t)$\n- Irreversible reaction $B \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} C$: rate $r_2 = k_2 b(t)$\n\nThe net rate of change for each species is the sum of the rates of reactions that produce it minus the sum of the rates of reactions that consume it.\nFor species $A$:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dt} = -r_1 + r_{-1} = -k_1 a + k_{-1} b $$\nFor species $B$:\n$$ \\frac{db}{dt} = r_1 - r_{-1} - r_2 = k_1 a - k_{-1} b - k_2 b = k_1 a - (k_{-1} + k_2)b $$\nFor species $C$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dt} = r_2 = k_2 b $$\nThis system of three ODEs describes the evolution of the system.\n\nTo address tasks 2 and 4, we first seek all linear conserved quantities. A quantity $I(a,b,c) = \\alpha a + \\beta b + \\gamma c$ is conserved if its total time derivative is zero for all time $t \\ge 0$.\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\alpha \\frac{da}{dt} + \\beta \\frac{db}{dt} + \\gamma \\frac{dc}{dt} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the rate equations into this expression gives:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\alpha(-k_1 a + k_{-1} b) + \\beta(k_1 a - (k_{-1} + k_2)b) + \\gamma(k_2 b) $$\nTo ensure this identity holds for any and all values of $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ that can arise from the dynamics, we group terms by concentration and set their coefficients to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = a(t) \\cdot (-\\alpha k_1 + \\beta k_1) + b(t) \\cdot (\\alpha k_{-1} - \\beta(k_{-1} + k_2) + \\gamma k_2) = 0 $$\nThis yields a system of two linear equations for the coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$:\n$1$. Coefficient of $a$: $-\\alpha k_1 + \\beta k_1 = k_1(\\beta - \\alpha) = 0$. Since the rate constant $k_1 > 0$, we must have $\\beta = \\alpha$.\n$2$. Coefficient of $b$: $\\alpha k_{-1} - \\beta(k_{-1} + k_2) + \\gamma k_2 = 0$. Substituting $\\beta = \\alpha$ into this equation gives $\\alpha k_{-1} - \\alpha(k_{-1} + k_2) + \\gamma k_2 = 0$, which simplifies to $-\\alpha k_2 + \\gamma k_2 = k_2(\\gamma - \\alpha) = 0$.\nSince $k_2 > 0$, it follows that $\\gamma = \\alpha$.\nThus, any linear conserved quantity must be of the form $I(a,b,c) = \\alpha a + \\alpha b + \\alpha c = \\alpha(a+b+c)$ for some constant $\\alpha$. This completes task 4. The level sets of this conserved quantity, $a+b+c = \\text{constant}$, define a family of parallel planes in the $(a,b,c)$ concentration space. Any given trajectory is confined to one such plane, making these planes the invariant linear manifolds of the system.\n\nThe value of the constant is determined by the initial conditions: $a(t)+b(t)+c(t) = a_0+b_0+c_0 = S_T$, where $S_T$ is the total initial concentration. This conservation law allows us to analyze the system in a reduced-dimension state space. For task 2, we define the phase plane for the subsystem $(a(t),b(t))$. The dynamics are constrained not only by the conservation law $a+b+c=S_T$ but also by the physical requirement that all concentrations remain non-negative: $a \\ge 0$, $b \\ge 0$, and $c \\ge 0$. The constraint $c(t) \\ge 0$ can be rewritten using the conservation law as $S_T - a(t) - b(t) \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $a(t)+b(t) \\le S_T$. Therefore, the dynamically accessible state space for the $(a,b)$ subsystem is the triangular region in the first quadrant of the $(a,b)$-plane defined by the inequalities:\n$$ a \\ge 0, \\quad b \\ge 0, \\quad a+b \\le S_T $$\n\nNow we address task 3, the determination of the nullclines in the $(a,b)$-plane.\nThe $a$-nullcline is the curve where $\\frac{da}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ -k_1 a + k_{-1} b = 0 \\implies b = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} a $$\nThis is a straight line through the origin with a positive slope. Geometrically, on this line, the flow of the system is purely vertical (only $b$ can change).\n\nThe $b$-nullcline is the curve where $\\frac{db}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ k_1 a - (k_{-1} + k_2)b = 0 \\implies b = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2} a $$\nThis is also a straight line through the origin. On this line, the flow is purely horizontal (only $a$ can change).\nThe intersection of these two nullclines defines the steady states (fixed points) of the system. The only solution to the system $b = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} a$ and $b = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2} a$ (given $k_{i} > 0$) is $(a,b) = (0,0)$. This corresponds to the final equilibrium state of the closed system where all material has been converted to the terminal species $C$, so that $(a_{ss}, b_{ss}, c_{ss}) = (0, 0, S_T)$.\n\nFinally, for task 5, we must report a single explicit expression for a conserved scalar $I(a,b,c)$ with the normalization $\\alpha=1$. From our derivation, we found that all linear conserved quantities are a multiple of $(a+b+c)$. Setting the coefficient $\\alpha = 1$ yields $\\beta=1$ and $\\gamma=1$. The resulting conserved quantity is:\n$$ I(a,b,c) = a+b+c $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a+b+c}$$", "id": "2663046"}, {"introduction": "Kinetic systems often exhibit dramatic shifts in behavior, such as switching between different stable states, as conditions change.

Nullclines and Equilibria**\n\nThe nullclines are curves in the $(x, y)$ phase plane where one of the time derivatives is zero.\nThe $x$-nullcline is defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, which gives:\n$$y = x^3 - 3x$$\nThis is a cubic function of $x$. Let us denote $h(x) = x^3 - 3x$.\n\nThe $y$-nullcline is defined by $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$, which gives:\n$$\\mu - \\delta y = 0 \\implies y = \\frac{\\mu}{\\delta}$$\nThis is a horizontal line whose vertical position is determined by the control parameter $\\mu$.\n\nEquilibria, or fixed points $(x^*, y^*)$, are the points where both derivatives are zero simultaneously. They are the intersections of the two nullclines. The coordinates of the equilibria must satisfy:\n$$y^* = \\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y^* = (x^*)^3 - 3x^*$$\nThus, the $x$-coordinates of the equilibria are the real roots of the equation:\n$$(x^*)^3 - 3x^* = \\frac{\\mu}{\\delta}$$\nThe number of equilibria is the number of real solutions to this equation. To analyze this, we examine the function $h(x) = x^3 - 3x$. Its local extrema are found by setting its derivative to zero:\n$$h'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 = 0 \\implies x^2 = 1 \\implies x = \\pm 1$$\nThe local maximum is at $x = -1$, where $h(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) = 2$.\nThe local minimum is at $x = 1$, where $h(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1) = -2$.\n\nThe number of equilibria depends on the value of $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta}$:\n- If $-2 < \\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} < 2$, i.e., $-2\\delta < \\mu < 2\\delta$, there are three distinct real roots for $x^*$, and thus three equilibria.\n- If $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} = 2$ or $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} = -2$, i.e., $\\mu = 2\\delta$ or $\\mu = -2\\delta$, there are two distinct real roots for $x^*$, one of which is a double root. There are two equilibria.\n- If $|\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta}| > 2$, i.e., $|\\mu| > 2\\delta$, there is only one real root for $x^*$, and thus one equilibrium.\n\n**2. Stability of Equilibria**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium $(x^*, y^*)$ is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at that point. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y - (x^3 - 3x)) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y - (x^3 - 3x)) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\mu - \\delta y) & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\mu - \\delta y) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(3x^2 - 3) & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 - 3x^2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -\\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the Jacobian is an upper triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n$$\\lambda_1 = 3 - 3(x^*)^2$$\n$$\\lambda_2 = -\\delta$$\nGiven $\\delta > 0$, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$ is always negative. The stability of the equilibrium therefore depends entirely on the sign of $\\lambda_1$:\n- If $\\lambda_1 < 0$, both eigenvalues are negative. The equilibrium is an **asymptotically stable node**. This occurs when $3 - 3(x^*)^2 < 0 \\implies 1 < (x^*)^2 \\implies |x^*| > 1$.\n- If $\\lambda_1 > 0$, one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative. The equilibrium is a **saddle**. This occurs when $3 - 3(x^*)^2 > 0 \\implies 1 > (x^*)^2 \\implies |x^*| < 1$.\n- If $\\lambda_1 = 0$, one eigenvalue is zero. The equilibrium is non-hyperbolic, indicating a bifurcation. This occurs when $3 - 3(x^*)^2 = 0 \\implies |x^*| = 1$.\n\n**3. Bifurcation Analysis**\n\nA saddle-node bifurcation occurs when $\\lambda_1 = 0$, which is at $|x^*|=1$.\n- If $x^* = 1$, we are at the local minimum of the $x$-nullcline. The equilibrium condition becomes $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} = h(1) = -2$, so $\\mu = -2\\delta$.\n- If $x^* = -1$, we are at the local maximum of the $x$-nullcline. The equilibrium condition becomes $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} = h(-1) = 2$, so $\\mu = 2\\delta$.\nThese are the bifurcation points where the horizontal $y$-nullcline becomes tangent to the cubic $x$-nullcline at one of its folds (extrema).\n\nNow we can evaluate each option.\n\n**A. For $\\mu \\in \\big(-2 \\delta,\\, 2 \\delta\\big)$, there are three equilibria: two asymptotically stable nodes located at equilibria with $\\lvert x \\rvert \\!>\\! 1$, and one saddle located at an equilibrium with $\\lvert x \\rvert \\!<\\! 1$. The stable manifold of the saddle is the separatrix dividing the basins of attraction of the two stable nodes.**\nFor $\\mu \\in (-2\\delta, 2\\delta)$, the equation $x^3-3x = \\mu/\\delta$ has three real roots $x_1^*, x_2^*, x_3^*$. By the shape of the cubic function $h(x)$, these roots are located such that one is in $(-\\infty, -1)$, one is in $(-1, 1)$, and one is in $(1, \\infty)$.\n- The two outer roots satisfy $|x^*|>1$, which corresponds to $\\lambda_1 < 0$. These are two asymptotically stable nodes.\n- The middle root satisfies $|x^*|<1$, which corresponds to $\\lambda_1 > 0$. This is a saddle.\nIn a bistable system with two stable attractors (the nodes) and a saddle, the stable manifold of the saddle point acts as the separatrix dividing the basins of attraction. This entire statement is a correct and complete description of the system in this parameter range.\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**B. Saddle-node bifurcations occur exactly at $\\mu \\!=\\! -2 \\delta$ and $\\mu \\!=\\! 2 \\delta$, where the horizontal $y$-nullcline is tangent to the cubic $x$-nullcline at the folds $x \\!=\\! 1$ and $x \\!=\\! -1$, respectively. At these parameter values, the Jacobian at the tangency has one zero eigenvalue and one negative eigenvalue.**\nAs derived above, bifurcations occur at $\\mu = \\pm 2\\delta$.\n- At $\\mu = -2\\delta$, we have $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} = -2$, which is the value of the cubic nullcline at its local minimum, $x=1$. So the tangency is at $x=1$.\n- At $\\mu = 2\\delta$, we have $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} = 2$, which is the value of the cubic nullcline at its local maximum, $x=-1$. So the tangency is at $x=-1$.\nThe \"respectively\" mapping is correct: $(\\mu=-2\\delta \\leftrightarrow x=1)$ and $(\\mu=2\\delta \\leftrightarrow x=-1)$.\nAt these points, $|x^*|=1$, so the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 3 - 3(1)^2 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\delta$. Since $\\delta>0$, $\\lambda_2$ is negative. This confirms the Jacobian has one zero and one negative eigenvalue at the tangency.\n**Verdict for B: Correct.**\n\n**C. As $\\mu$ increases through $\\mu \\!=\\! -2 \\delta$, a node–saddle pair is created near $x \\approx 1$; the basin of the preexisting left stable node shrinks, while the basin of the newly created right stable node grows from zero, bounded initially by the stable manifold of the new saddle.**\n- For $\\mu < -2\\delta$, there is one equilibrium with $x$-coordinate satisfying $x^3-3x < -2$. The solution must have $x<-2$. Since $|x|>1$, it is a stable node. This is the \"preexisting left stable node.\" Its basin is the entire phase plane.\n- At $\\mu = -2\\delta$, a non-hyperbolic equilibrium (a saddle-node) appears at $x=1$.\n- As $\\mu$ increases to a value slightly greater than $-2\\delta$, this single point at $x=1$ splits into two new equilibria: a saddle with $x^*<1$ and a stable node with $x^*>1$. Both are near $x=1$. Thus, a \"node-saddle pair is created near $x \\approx 1$\".\n- The original stable node continues to exist (its $x$-coordinate is now slightly greater than $-2$). Since there is now a second stable node (the \"newly created right stable node\"), the basin of the \"preexisting left stable node\" is no longer the entire plane; hence, it has shrunk.\n- The new stable node has its own basin of attraction, which appears at the bifurcation and grows as $\\mu$ increases. The boundary of this new basin is the stable manifold of the newly created saddle. This is a classic description of a saddle-node bifurcation's effect on the global phase portrait.\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\n**D. For $\\mu \\!>\\! 2 \\delta$ there are no equilibria, and all trajectories diverge to infinity in forward time.**\nFor $\\mu > 2\\delta$, we have $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} > 2$. The equation $(x^*)^3 - 3x^* = \\frac{\\mu}{\\delta}$ has exactly one real solution because the cubic function $h(x)$ spans all real numbers. Let this solution be $x^*_0$. Since $\\frac{\\mu}{\\delta} > 2 = h(-1)$, this solution must be in the range where $h(x)$ is increasing and greater than $2$, meaning $x^*_0 > 2$ (since $h(2)=2$). For this equilibrium, $|x^*_0| > 1$, so it is an asymptotically stable node. The statement \"there are no equilibria\" is false. Since there is a stable node, it is also false that \"all trajectories diverge to infinity\"; in fact, all trajectories converge to this stable node.\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For every equilibrium and every $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is strictly positive, so saddles cannot occur in this model.**\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is $\\det(J) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = (3 - 3(x^*)^2)(-\\delta) = 3\\delta((x^*)^2 - 1)$.\nFor a saddle to exist, the eigenvalues must have opposite signs, which means $\\det(J) < 0$.\nGiven $\\delta > 0$, $\\det(J) < 0$ requires $(x^*)^2 - 1 < 0$, which means $|x^*| < 1$.\nAs established in the analysis for option A, for any $\\mu \\in (-2\\delta, 2\\delta)$, there exists an equilibrium with $|x^*|<1$. For this equilibrium, the determinant is negative, and it is a saddle. Therefore, the statement that the determinant is always strictly positive is false, and the conclusion that saddles cannot occur is also false.\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect.**\n\nAll statements A, B, and C are correct descriptions of the system's behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2663015"}, {"introduction": "While bifurcation theory describes dramatic, qualitative changes in a system, it is often just as important to understand the subtle, quantitative shifts of steady states in response to parameter fluctuations.

To find these sensitivities, we differentiate the steady-state equations with respect to $\\theta$, applying the chain rule since $x^*$ and $y^*$ are functions of $\\theta$.\n\nDifferentiating the first equation, $f(x^*, y^*; \\theta) = 0$, with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( \\theta - x^* - x^*y^* \\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^*} \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y^*} \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $f$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -1 - y \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^*} = -1 - y^*\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -x \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y^*} = -x^*\n$$\nSubstituting these into the differentiated equation gives our first linear equation for the sensitivities:\n$$\n1 + (-1 - y^*) \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + (-x^*) \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1 + y^*) \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + x^* \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 1\n$$\nNext, we differentiate the second equation, $g(x^*, y^*) = 0$, with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( 2 + x^* - 2y^* \\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^*} \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y^*} \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $g$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^*} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -2 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y^*} = -2\n$$\nSubstituting these gives our second linear equation:\n$$\n0 + (1) \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + (-2) \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} - 2 \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nThe derived system of linear equations for the sensitivities $\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n(1 + y^*) \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + x^* \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} - 2 \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis system can also be expressed in matrix form using the Jacobian matrix of the system $(f,g)$ with respect to $(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^*} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y^*} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x^*} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y^*}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= -\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\implies\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-(1+y^*) & -x^* \\\\\n1 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to the system derived above.\n\nTo solve for the sensitivities at $\\theta=6$, we must first find the corresponding steady state $(x^*, y^*)$. We solve the system:\n$$\n6 - x^* - x^*y^* = 0\n$$\n$$\n2 + x^* - 2y^* = 0\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we express $y^*$ in terms of $x^*$:\n$$\n2y^* = 2 + x^* \\implies y^* = 1 + \\frac{x^*}{2}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $y^*$ into the first equation:\n$$\n6 - x^* - x^* \\left(1 + \\frac{x^*}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n6 - x^* - x^* - \\frac{(x^*)^2}{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n6 - 2x^* - \\frac{(x^*)^2}{2} = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $-2$ to clear the fraction and make the leading coefficient positive gives:\n$$\n(x^*)^2 + 4x^* - 12 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $x^*$. We can solve it by factoring:\n$$\n(x^* + 6)(x^* - 2) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions are $x^* = 2$ and $x^* = -6$. Since $x^*$ represents a physical concentration, it must be non-negative. Thus, the only physically meaningful solution is $x^*=2$.\nThe corresponding value for $y^*$ is:\n$$\ny^* = 1 + \\frac{2}{2} = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nSo, the steady state for $\\theta=6$ is $(x^*, y^*) = (2, 2)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the system of equations for the sensitivities at this steady state:\n$$\n(1 + 2) \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + 2 \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 1 \\implies 3 \\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} + 2 \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} - 2 \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we have $\\frac{\\partial x^*}{\\partial \\theta} = 2 \\frac{\\partial y^*}{\\partial \\theta}$.
