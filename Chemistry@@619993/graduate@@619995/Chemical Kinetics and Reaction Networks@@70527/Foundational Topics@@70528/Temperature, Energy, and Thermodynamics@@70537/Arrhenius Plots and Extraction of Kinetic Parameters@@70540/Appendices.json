The Arrhenius equation, $k = A \\exp(-E_a/(RT))$, is a cornerstone of chemical kinetics. The method of linearizing this equation by taking the natural logarithm and performing a linear regression is a standard and widely accepted technique for extracting the kinetic parameters $A$ and $E_a$ from experimental data.\n\nThe problem is well-posed and self-contained.

The conditions $T_i$ in kelvin and $k_i > 0$ are necessary for the model and the transformation to be physically and mathematically meaningful. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Procedure**\nThe Arrhenius equation is given by:\n$$k = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in kelvin.\n\nTo use ordinary least squares for a linear model, this equation must be transformed into a linear form. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:\n$$\\ln k = \\ln\\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$\\ln k = \\ln A + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\ln k = \\ln A - \\frac{E_a}{RT}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the form of a straight line, $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$:\n$$\\ln k = \\ln A + \\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R}\\right) \\frac{1}{T}$$\nThis establishes the linear relationship between the transformed variables.\n- The dependent variable is $y_i = \\ln k_i$.\n- The independent variable is $x_i = 1/T_i$.\n- The y-intercept is $\\beta_0 = \\ln A$.\n- The slope is $\\beta_1 = -E_a/R$.\n\nThe problem specifies that ordinary least squares (OLS) must be used. For a set of data points $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, the OLS estimators for the slope ($\\hat{\\beta}_1$) and intercept ($\\hat{\\beta}_0$) are:\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$$\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum y_i$ are the sample means.\n\nOnce the parameters $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ are estimated from the data, the physical parameters $E_a$ and $A$ are recovered as follows:\n- From $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = -E_a/R$, we solve for the activation energy: $E_a = -R \\hat{\\beta}_1$.\n- From $\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\ln A$, we solve for the pre-exponential factor: $A = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\n\nA critical part of any regression analysis is the diagnostic checking of the residuals, $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i = y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i)$. A practitioner must inspect plots of the residuals to check for violations of the OLS assumptions, such as non-linearity (indicated by curvature in the residual plot), heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), and the presence of influential outliers. This step validates the applicability of the linear model to the data.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This option correctly presents all steps of the procedure derived above.\n1. It correctly identifies the transformation: $x_i = 1/T_i$ and $y_i = \\ln k_i$.\n2. It correctly states the formulas for the OLS estimators $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ in terms of the sums of squares $S_{xx}$ and $S_{xy}$.\n3. It correctly identifies the physical parameters from the regression coefficients: $E_a = -R \\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $A = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\n4. It correctly includes the essential step of inspecting residuals for systematic deviations, which is a hallmark of a sound statistical analysis.\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option uses an incorrect transformation of the independent variable, $x_i=T_i$ instead of $x_i=1/T_i$. Fitting $\\ln k$ versus $T$ does not linearize the Arrhenius equation. The relationship $\\ln k = \\ln A - (E_a/R)(1/T)$ is not linear in $T$. Therefore, the entire procedure is based on an incorrect model, and the subsequent identification of parameters would be invalid.\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option uses the correct variable transformation, $x_i=1/T_i$ and $y_i=\\ln k_i$. However, the identification of the physical parameters from the fitted line is erroneous. It states $E_a = R \\hat{\\beta}_1$ (incorrect sign) and $A = \\hat{\\beta}_0$ (confusing the parameter with its logarithm). The correct relations are $E_a = -R \\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $A = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$. These are fundamental errors in interpreting the results of the linear regression.\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option describes non-linear least squares (NLLS) on the original, untransformed data. While NLLS is a valid, and in some statistical senses superior, method for fitting the Arrhenius equation, the problem specifically mandates a procedure \"consistent with ordinary least squares on $(x_i,y_i)=(1/T_i,\\ln k_i)$\". This option explicitly proposes an alternative to the requested method and is therefore not a correct answer to the question as posed.\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A provides a fully correct and complete description of the required procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2627349"}, {"introduction": "Obtaining a value for the activation energy is only half the battle; understanding its uncertainty is equally important for rigorous scientific work.

As $s_{1/T}^{2}$ approaches zero (which occurs as the temperature range narrows), the denominator $(N-1)s_{1/T}^{2}$ also approaches zero. This causes the entire fraction, and thus $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{E}_a)$, to become very large.\n\nPhysically, this is a manifestation of a fundamental principle in regression analysis. The slope of a line is determined by the \"rise over run\". The activation energy is proportional to this slope. When the \"run\" (the spread of the $x_i = 1/T_i$ values) is very small, even minor random experimental errors (the \"rise\", represented by $\\sigma_{y}^{2}$) in the $y_i = \\ln(k_i)$ values can cause a large fluctuation in the calculated slope. To accurately determine the slope of a line, one must measure points that are far apart. Collecting data over a narrow temperature range is equivalent to determining a slope from a tight cluster of points, an inherently imprecise task.
