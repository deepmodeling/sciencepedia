The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $2.500$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a qualitative discussion of the criterion separating kinetic from thermodynamic control.\n\nIn the context of a branching reaction network, the distinction is as follows:\n\n1.  **Kinetic Control**: This regime prevails when the product ratio is determined by the relative rates of the competing pathways. For this to occur, the reactions leading to the products must be effectively irreversible under the operating conditions, or the reaction must be stopped before equilibrium can be established. In the given problem, all reaction steps are defined as irreversible. Consequently, the system is exclusively under kinetic control. The product ratio, $[P_1]/[P_2] = k_1/k_2$, reflects the fact that the pathway to $P_1$ is simply faster than the pathway to $P_2$. The relative thermodynamic stabilities of $P_1$ and $P_2$ are irrelevant. In terms of rate constants, kinetic control is guaranteed if any reverse rate constants (e.g., $k_{-1}$ for $I_1 \\to A$) are negligible compared to the forward rate constants, i.e., $k_1 \\gg k_{-1}$ and $k_2 \\gg k_{-2}$.\n\n2.  **Thermodynamic Control**: This regime is achieved only when the reaction pathways are reversible and the system is allowed to reach chemical equilibrium. At equilibrium, the product distribution is determined by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the products, which are quantified by the overall equilibrium constants of the reactions. The thermodynamically more stable product (the one with lower Gibbs free energy) will be the major product, irrespective of how fast it was formed. For the network to be under thermodynamic control, the reverse reactions must be significant. For example, if we had $A \\rightleftharpoons P_1$ and $A \\rightleftharpoons P_2$, the equilibrium ratio would be $[P_1]_{eq}/[P_2]_{eq} = K_{eq,1}/K_{eq,2}$. The criterion, in terms of rate constants, is that the reverse rate constants for all steps must be non-zero, allowing the system to equilibrate. This condition is often met at higher temperatures, which provide sufficient energy to overcome the activation barriers of both forward and reverse reactions, and at long reaction times.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental criterion separating the two regimes is **reversibility**.

In this network, however, both $I\\rightleftharpoons P_1$ and $J\\rightleftharpoons P_2$ are reversible, and $I\\rightleftharpoons J$ is very fast, so any $P_1$ formed can return to $I$, equilibrate with $J$, and proceed to $P_2$, and vice versa. These hidden cycles erase initial kinetic preferences and drive the system to the thermodynamic product ratio. Thus the observed long-time distribution is thermodynamically controlled, even though barrier heights would suggest kinetic control at very short times.\n\nOption-by-option analysis.\n\n- Option A: This states that the fast $I\\rightleftharpoons J$ interconversion maintains a quasi-equilibrated intermediate pool and that, because the product-forming steps are reversible, there exist cycles connecting $P_1$ and $P_2$ through $I$ and $J$.
