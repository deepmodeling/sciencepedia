No flaws are identified.\n\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.** The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe complete solution requires three distinct steps: derivation, calculation, and verification.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Ratio of Rate Constants**\n\nWe begin from the foundational expression for a rate constant $k$ as given by Transition State Theory (TST) for a reaction in solution:\n$$ k = \\kappa \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $R$ is the molar gas constant, and $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of activation.\n\nFor the reversible reaction $\\mathrm{A} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B}$, we can write the TST expressions for the forward rate constant, $k^{+}$, and the reverse rate constant, $k^{-}$.\n\nThe forward rate constant $k^{+}$ corresponds to the process $\\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ and is given by:\n$$ k^{+} = \\kappa^{+} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}$ is the activation free energy for the forward reaction.\n\nThe reverse rate constant $k^{-}$ corresponds to the process $\\mathrm{B} \\to \\mathrm{A}$ and is given by:\n$$ k^{-} = \\kappa^{-} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}$ is the activation free energy for the reverse reaction.\n\nThe problem states that the transmission coefficients for the forward and reverse reactions are identical, a consequence of microscopic reversibility for a process with a single transition state. Thus, $\\kappa^{+} = \\kappa^{-}$.\n\nWe now construct the ratio $k^{+}/k^{-}$ by dividing the expression for $k^{+}$ by the expression for $k^{-}$:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\frac{\\kappa^{+} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\kappa^{-} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\n\nGiven that $\\kappa^{+} = \\kappa^{-}$, the transmission coefficients cancel. The pre-exponential factor $\\frac{k_B T}{h}$ is a constant for a given temperature and also cancels from the numerator and denominator. This leaves:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$, we simplify the expression:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nFinally, we combine the terms in the exponent to obtain the required relationship:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nThis expression connects the ratio of the kinetic rate constants to the difference in the activation free energies, derived purely from the principles of TST.\n\n**2. Numerical Computation of $k^{+}/k^{-}$**\n\nWe now use the derived expression and the given data to compute the numerical value of the ratio. First, we convert the energies from $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ for consistency with the units of the gas constant $R$.\n$\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}} = 75.2~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 75200~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} = 66.4~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 66400~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nThe other parameters are:\n$R = 8.314462618~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$T = 298.15~\\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{75200~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} - 66400~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314462618~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} \\times 298.15~\\mathrm{K}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8800}{2478.956...}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp(-3.550069...) $$\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} \\approx 0.028723 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as required, we get $0.0287$.\n\n**3. Verification with Equilibrium Thermodynamics**\n\nThe third part requires an independent verification of this result using equilibrium principles. The principle of detailed balance states that at equilibrium, the rate of every elementary process is equal to the rate of its reverse process. For the reaction $\\mathrm{A} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B}$, this means:\n$$ \\text{rate}_{\\mathrm{forward}} = \\text{rate}_{\\mathrm{reverse}} $$\n$$ k^{+}[\\mathrm{A}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k^{-}[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\mathrm{eq}} $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{A}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and $[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ are the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nRearranging this equation gives a relationship between the ratio of rate constants and the ratio of equilibrium concentrations:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[\\mathrm{A}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}} $$\nThe ratio of equilibrium concentrations is, by definition, the equilibrium constant for the reaction, $K_{c}$.\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = K_{c} $$\n\nFrom fundamental chemical thermodynamics, the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ$, is related to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant $K$ by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta_{r} G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K $$\nAssuming standard states of $1~\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ for species in solution, $K$ is equivalent to $K_{c}$. We can therefore write:\n$$ K_{c} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ}{RT}\\right) $$\nCombining these two results from equilibrium principles, we obtain an independent expression for the ratio of rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ}{RT}\\right) $$\n\nNow we use the provided thermodynamic data to compute this ratio:\n$\\Delta_{r} G^\\circ = 8.80~\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 8800~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8800~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314462618~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} \\times 298.15~\\mathrm{K}}\\right) $$\nThe argument of the exponent is identical to that calculated in Part 2.\n$$ \\frac{k^{+}}{k^{-}} = \\exp(-3.550069...) \\approx 0.028723 $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.0287$.\n\nThe value obtained from kinetic data via TST is identical to the value obtained from thermodynamic data via detailed balance. This confirms that the kinetic and thermodynamic data provided are mutually consistent, as is required by the laws of chemistry. The consistency stems from the fundamental relationship $\\Delta_{r} G^{\\circ} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\ddagger} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{r}}^{\\ddagger}$, which is the energetic representation of the principle of microscopic reversibility for a single reaction coordinate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0287}$$", "id": "2688117"}, {"introduction": "Having established the kinetic-thermodynamic link for a single step, we now explore its consequences in a network of connected reactions.

The problem is therefore **valid**.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\n\n1. Derivation of the Detailed Balance Constraint\n\nThe principle of microscopic reversibility, or detailed balance, requires that at a thermodynamic equilibrium state, the rate of every forward elementary reaction must equal the rate of its corresponding reverse reaction. Let the concentrations at such an equilibrium be $(x_e, y_e)$, where $x_e > 0$ and $y_e > 0$. We apply this principle to each of the three reversible reaction pairs. The reaction rates (fluxes) are defined by the product of the rate constant and the monomial of the source complex.\n\nFor the reaction $C_{1} \\rightleftharpoons C_{3}$:\nThe forward flux is $k_{13}\\psi_1 = k_{13}x$. The reverse flux is $k_{31}\\psi_3 = k_{31}xy$. At equilibrium, these must be equal:\n$$k_{13}x_e = k_{31}x_e y_e$$\nSince $x_e > 0$, we can divide by $x_e$ to obtain a condition on $y_e$:\n$$y_e = \\frac{k_{13}}{k_{31}}$$\n\nFor the reaction $C_{2} \\rightleftharpoons C_{3}$:\nThe forward flux is $k_{23}\\psi_2 = k_{23}y$. The reverse flux is $k_{32}\\psi_3 = k_{32}xy$. At equilibrium:\n$$k_{23}y_e = k_{32}x_e y_e$$\nSince $y_e > 0$ (as established from the first condition and positive rate constants), we can divide by $y_e$ to obtain a condition on $x_e$:\n$$x_e = \\frac{k_{23}}{k_{32}}$$\n\nFor the reaction $C_{1} \\rightleftharpoons C_{2}$:\nThe forward flux is $k_{12}\\psi_1 = k_{12}x$. The reverse flux is $k_{21}\\psi_2 = k_{21}y$. At equilibrium:\n$$k_{12}x_e = k_{21}y_e$$\n\nFor a detailed-balanced equilibrium to exist, there must be a single pair $(x_e, y_e)$ that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. We substitute the expressions for $x_e$ and $y_e$ derived from the first two reactions into the third reaction's balance equation:\n$$k_{12}\\left(\\frac{k_{23}}{k_{32}}\\right) = k_{21}\\left(\\frac{k_{13}}{k_{31}}\\right)$$\nThis equation is a constraint on the rate constants. It is a necessary condition for the existence of a detailed-balanced equilibrium. To show it is sufficient, assume this relation holds. We can then define positive concentrations $x_e = k_{23}/k_{32}$ and $y_e = k_{13}/k_{31}$. By construction, these values satisfy the equilibrium conditions for the first two reactions, and because the rate-constant relation is assumed to hold, they also satisfy the third. Thus, this algebraic constraint is both necessary and sufficient. Rearranging for clarity, we get:\n$$k_{12}k_{23}k_{31} = k_{13}k_{32}k_{21}$$\nThis is the required algebraic constraint, known as a Wegscheider condition.\n\n2. Existence of a Complex-Balanced Equilibrium\n\nTo determine if this network admits a complex-balanced equilibrium for arbitrary positive rate constants, we invoke the Deficiency Zero Theorem from chemical reaction network theory. A network is guaranteed to admit a complex-balanced equilibrium for any set of positive rate constants if it is weakly reversible and its deficiency is zero.\n\nThe deficiency, $\\delta$, is defined as $\\delta = n - l - s$, where:\n- $n$ is the number of complexes.\n- $l$ is the number of linkage classes.\n- $s$ is the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace.\n\nLet us calculate these quantities for the given network.\n- Number of complexes, $n$: The complexes are $C_{1}=X$, $C_{2}=Y$, and $C_{3}=X+Y$. Thus, $n=3$.\n- Number of linkage classes, $l$: The reactions $C_{1} \\leftrightarrow C_{2}$, $C_{2} \\leftrightarrow C_{3}$, and $C_{3} \\leftrightarrow C_{1}$ connect all three complexes into a single component in the reaction graph. Thus, there is one linkage class, so $l=1$. The network is also weakly reversible because all reactions are reversible.\n- Dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, $s$: The stoichiometric subspace is spanned by the reaction vectors $C_{j}-C_{i}$ corresponding to each reaction. We represent the complexes as vectors in the species space $(X, Y)$:\n  $$ \\mathbf{c}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{c}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{c}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe reaction vectors are:\n  $$ \\mathbf{v}_{12} = \\mathbf{c}_2 - \\mathbf{c}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n  $$ \\mathbf{v}_{23} = \\mathbf{c}_3 - \\mathbf{c}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n  $$ \\mathbf{v}_{31} = \\mathbf{c}_1 - \\mathbf{c}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe stoichiometric subspace $S$ is the span of these three vectors. We check for linear dependence:\n  $$ \\mathbf{v}_{12} + \\mathbf{v}_{23} + \\mathbf{v}_{31} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince the vectors sum to zero, they are linearly dependent. The subspace can be spanned by any two of them, for example $\\mathbf{v}_{12}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{23}$, which are clearly linearly independent. Therefore, the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace is $s=2$.\n\nNow, we calculate the deficiency:\n$$\\delta = n - l - s = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0$$\nThe network has a deficiency of zero. According to the Deficiency Zero Theorem, because the network is also weakly reversible, it admits a complex-balanced equilibrium for any choice of positive rate constants. The answer is therefore yes.\n\n3. Evaluation of the Cycle Affinity $\\Delta$\n\nThe quantity $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta \\equiv \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k_{13}\\,k_{32}\\,k_{21}}{k_{31}\\,k_{23}\\,k_{12}}\\right) $$\nThis expression represents the thermodynamic affinity associated with traversing the cycle of complexes $C_1 \\to C_3 \\to C_2 \\to C_1$. Note that the system is in detailed balance if and only if the argument of the logarithm is equal to $1$, which implies $\\Delta=0$.\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values for the rate constants:\n$$ k_{13} = 5, \\quad k_{31} = 2, \\quad k_{23} = 11, \\quad k_{32} = 7, \\quad k_{12} = 3, \\quad k_{21} = 13 $$\nThe argument of the logarithm is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{13}\\,k_{32}\\,k_{21}}{k_{31}\\,k_{23}\\,k_{12}} = \\frac{5 \\times 7 \\times 13}{2 \\times 11 \\times 3} = \\frac{455}{66} $$\nNow we evaluate $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\ln\\left(\\frac{455}{66}\\right) $$\nCalculating this value and rounding to six significant figures:\n$$ \\frac{455}{66} \\approx 6.893939\\ldots $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\ln(6.893939\\ldots) \\approx 1.9306359\\ldots $$\nTo six significant figures, the result is $1.93064$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{ k_{12}k_{23}k_{31} = k_{13}k_{32}k_{21} & \\text{Yes} & 1.93064 }}\n$$", "id": "2688096"}]}
