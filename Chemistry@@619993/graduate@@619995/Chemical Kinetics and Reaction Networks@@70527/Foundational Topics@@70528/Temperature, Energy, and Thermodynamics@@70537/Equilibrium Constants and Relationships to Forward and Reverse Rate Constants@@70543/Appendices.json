This first practice establishes this cornerstone concept by asking you to derive the fundamental connection between the equilibrium constant ($K_c$) and the forward and reverse rate constants ($k_f$ and $k_r$) for a simple elementary reaction. By working through this derivation [@problem_id:2641749], you will not only solidify your understanding of why $K_c = k_f/k_r$ holds but also appreciate the crucial role of units and standard states in linking the kinetic description of a reaction to its formal thermodynamic properties.", "problem": "Consider the elementary reversible association in a dilute ideal solution, written as $A + B \\rightleftharpoons AB$.

It is a standard exercise in chemical kinetics that tests fundamental principles. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem specifies an elementary reversible association reaction in a dilute ideal solution under isothermal conditions:\n$$\nA + B \\rightleftharpoons AB\n$$\nThe forward step, $A + B \\rightarrow AB$, is a bimolecular process with rate constant $k_{f}$. The reverse step, $AB \\rightarrow A + B$, is a unimolecular process with rate constant $k_{r}$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action for elementary reactions, the rate of the forward reaction, $v_{f}$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$\nv_{f} = k_{f} [A] [B]\n$$\nThe rate of the reverse reaction, $v_{r}$, is proportional to the concentration of the reactant for that step:\n$$\nv_{r} = k_{r} [AB]\n$$\nHere, $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[AB]$ represent the molar concentrations of the respective species.\n\nThe problem requires us to use the definition of chemical equilibrium as the state of vanishing net production rate. The net rate of reaction, specifically the net rate of formation of the product $AB$, is the difference between the forward and reverse rates:\n$$\nv_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{d[AB]}{dt} = v_{f} - v_{r} = k_{f} [A] [B] - k_{r} [AB]\n$$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of reaction is zero, which means the concentrations of all species are constant in time. This condition implies that the rate of the forward reaction must be equal to the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$\nv_{f} = v_{r}\n$$\nLet us denote the concentrations at equilibrium as $[A]_{\\text{eq}}$, $[B]_{\\text{eq}}$, and $[AB]_{\\text{eq}}$. Substituting the rate expressions into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\nk_{f} [A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}} = k_{r} [AB]_{\\text{eq}}\n$$\nThe concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_{c}$, is defined by the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of products to reactants, with each concentration raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient. For the given reaction, this is:\n$$\nK_{c} = \\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}}}\n$$\nBy rearranging the equation derived from the equality of rates at equilibrium, we can express this ratio in terms of the rate constants:\n$$\n\\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}\n$$\nThus, we have derived the fundamental relationship between the equilibrium constant and the kinetic rate constants for this elementary reaction:\n$$\nK_{c} = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}\n$$\nWe are given the numerical values for the rate constants: $k_{f} = 3.184 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{r} = 0.812\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The values $3.184$ (four significant figures) and $0.812$ (three significant figures) limit the precision of the result. Therefore:\n$$\nK_{c} \\approx 3.92 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we address the question of units. The units of $K_{c}$ are a direct consequence of its definition, both from the concentrations and from the rate constants.

For $A + B \\rightleftharpoons AB$, $\\Delta n = 1 - (1+1) = -1$.\n\nFinally, we must explain how a dimensionless thermodynamic equilibrium constant, which we shall denote $K_{\\text{eq}}$, is obtained. In formal thermodynamics, the equilibrium constant is defined in terms of activities, not concentrations. For a solute $i$ in a dilute ideal solution, its activity $a_{i}$ is defined as a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\na_{i} = \\frac{[i]}{C^{\\circ}}\n$$\nwhere $C^{\\circ}$ is the standard state concentration, specified here as $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The thermodynamic equilibrium constant is then:\n$$\nK_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{a_{AB}}{a_{A} a_{B}} = \\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}/C^{\\circ}}{([A]_{\\text{eq}}/C^{\\circ})([B]_{\\text{eq}}/C^{\\circ})}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression reveals its relationship to $K_{c}$:\n$$\nK_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}{[A]_{\\text{eq}}[B]_{\\text{eq}}} \\cdot \\frac{(C^{\\circ})^2}{C^{\\circ}} = K_{c} \\cdot C^{\\circ}\n$$\nBy this construction, $K_{\\text{eq}}$ is made dimensionless. The units of $K_{c}$ ($\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$) are canceled by the units of the standard concentration $C^{\\circ}$ ($\\mathrm{M}$):\n$$\n\\text{units of } K_{\\text{eq}} = (\\mathrm{M}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{M}) = \\mathrm{M}^{0} \\text{ (dimensionless)}\n$$\nWhen $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$, the numerical value of the dimensionless $K_{\\text{eq}}$ is identical to the numerical value of $K_{c}$ when its concentration units are expressed in Molarity ($\\mathrm{M}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.92 \\times 10^{7}}\n$$", "id": "2641749"}, {"introduction": "Real chemical systems often involve intricate networks of interconnected reactions, not just isolated processes.
