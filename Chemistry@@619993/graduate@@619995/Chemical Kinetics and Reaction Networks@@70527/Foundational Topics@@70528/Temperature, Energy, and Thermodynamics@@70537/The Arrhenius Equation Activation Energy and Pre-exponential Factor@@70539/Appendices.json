The first is a derivation to show the non-linearity of the Arrhenius plot for a composite reaction, and the second is a calculation of a specific temperature.\n\n**Part 1: Curvature of the Arrhenius Plot**\n\nAn Arrhenius plot is a plot of $\\ln(k)$ versus $1/T$. For a single elementary reaction obeying the Arrhenius law, $k(T) = A \\exp(-E_a/(RT))$, the natural logarithm is $\\ln k = \\ln A - E_a/(RT)$. This is a linear equation of the form $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\ln k$, $x = 1/T$, the intercept is $c = \\ln A$, and the slope is $m = -E_a/R$. A straight line on this plot is characteristic of a constant activation energy.\n\nFor the given system, the observed rate constant is the sum of two individual rate constants:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{obs}}(T) = k_1(T) + k_2(T) = A_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1}{RT}\\right) + A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2}{RT}\\right)$$\nThe apparent activation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$, is defined in terms of the slope of the plot of $\\ln k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ versus $1/T$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) \\equiv -R \\frac{d(\\ln k_{\\mathrm{obs}})}{d(1/T)}$$\nTo show that the plot is curved, we must demonstrate that $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ is not a constant, but rather a function of temperature $T$.\n\nLet us perform the differentiation. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{d(\\ln u)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{u}\\frac{du}{dx}$, with $u = k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ and the differentiation variable being $1/T$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln k_{\\mathrm{obs}})}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{obs}}} \\frac{d(k_{\\mathrm{obs}})}{d(1/T)}$$\nFirst, we find the derivative of $k_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ with respect to $1/T$:\n$$\\frac{d(k_{\\mathrm{obs}})}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d}{d(1/T)} \\left[ A_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1}{R} \\frac{1}{T}\\right) + A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2}{R} \\frac{1}{T}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{d(k_{\\mathrm{obs}})}{d(1/T)} = A_1 \\left(-\\frac{E_1}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1}{RT}\\right) + A_2 \\left(-\\frac{E_2}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2}{RT}\\right)$$\nRecognizing that $A_i \\exp(-E_i/(RT))$ is $k_i(T)$:\n$$\\frac{d(k_{\\mathrm{obs}})}{d(1/T)} = -\\frac{1}{R} \\left( E_1 k_1(T) + E_2 k_2(T) \\right)$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) = -R \\left( \\frac{1}{k_1(T) + k_2(T)} \\right) \\left[ -\\frac{1}{R} \\left( E_1 k_1(T) + E_2 k_2(T) \\right) \\right]$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T) = \\frac{E_1 k_1(T) + E_2 k_2(T)}{k_1(T) + k_2(T)}$$\nThis expression shows that the apparent activation energy is a weighted average of the individual activation energies $E_1$ and $E_2$. The weighting factors, $f_1(T) = \\frac{k_1(T)}{k_1(T)+k_2(T)}$ and $f_2(T) = \\frac{k_2(T)}{k_1(T)+k_2(T)}$, are the fractional contributions of each pathway to the total rate.\n\nThe ratio of these weighting factors depends on temperature:\n$$\\frac{f_2(T)}{f_1(T)} = \\frac{k_2(T)}{k_1(T)} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{RT}\\right)$$\nIf $E_1 \\neq E_2$, this ratio is a function of temperature. Consequently, the weighting factors $f_1(T)$ and $f_2(T)$ change with temperature, and therefore $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ is a function of temperature. Since the slope of the Arrhenius plot is $-E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)/R$, a temperature-dependent slope means the plot is not a straight line, but a curve. This is true for any parallel reaction scheme unless the activation energies of all pathways are identical ($E_1 = E_2$), in which case $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(T)$ simplifies to the constant $E_1 = E_2$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Crossover Temperature $T^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe dominant pathway switches at the temperature $T^{\\ast}$ where the rates of the two pathways are equal:\n$$k_1(T^{\\ast}) = k_2(T^{\\ast})$$\nSubstituting the Arrhenius expressions for each rate constant:\n$$A_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1}{RT^{\\ast}}\\right) = A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2}{RT^{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $T^{\\ast}$, we rearrange the equation by grouping the pre-exponential factors and the exponential terms:\n$$\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{\\exp(-E_2/RT^{\\ast})}{\\exp(-E_1/RT^{\\ast})} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_1 - E_2}{RT^{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{A_1}{A_2}\\right) = \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{RT^{\\ast}}$$\nIsolating $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$T^{\\ast} = \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{R \\ln(A_1/A_2)} = \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{R \\ln(A_2/A_1)}$$\nThe second form is preferable for calculation to avoid negative values in both numerator and denominator.

The errors $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T)$ are unitless decimals.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a bracketed, comma-separated list of the two decimal relative errors (in the order of the provided prediction temperatures) for one test case.

It describes a standard, albeit important, numerical experiment in chemical kinetics concerning the systematic error introduced when a non-Arrhenius rate coefficient is modeled using a simple Arrhenius form over a limited temperature range. The parameters provided for the test cases are physically reasonable. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe foundational principle is the Arrhenius equation for the rate coefficient $k$ of an elementary chemical reaction:\n$$\nk(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This problem considers a unimolecular reaction that can proceed through two parallel, independent pathways. The total, observable rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$ is the sum of the rate coefficients for each pathway:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{true}}(T) = k_1(T) + k_2(T) = A_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,1}}{RT}\\right) + A_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,2}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nIn general, the sum of two exponential functions is not a single exponential function. Consequently, $k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$ does not strictly adhere to the Arrhenius law. This is revealed by constructing an Arrhenius plot, where one plots the natural logarithm of the rate coefficient against the reciprocal temperature, $x = 1/T$. For a single elementary pathway, this plot is linear:\n$$\n\\ln k_i(T) = \\ln A_i - \\frac{E_{a,i}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is an equation of a line $y = b + mx$ with $y = \\ln k_i$, $b = \\ln A_i$, and $m = -E_{a,i}/R$. However, for the two-pathway system, the plot of $\\ln k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$ versus $1/T$ is curved. The effective activation energy, proportional to the local slope of this plot, becomes temperature-dependent.\n\nThe task is to quantify the error resulting from approximating this curved plot with a straight line over a finite temperature interval $[T_{\\min}, T_{\\max}]$ and then extrapolating this linear approximation to temperatures outside this interval.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the True Model**: We first define the function for the true reaction rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$ using the provided parameters $(A_1, E_{a,1})$ and $(A_2, E_{a,2})$. The constant $R$ is given as $8.31446261815324\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and the given activation energies in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ are converted to $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ by multiplying by $1000$.\n\n2.  **Generate Synthetic Data**: We generate a set of $N_{\\mathrm{fit}}$ data points for the linear regression. The temperatures $T_j$ are not spaced linearly, but rather their reciprocals $x_j = 1/T_j$ are spaced linearly over the interval $[1/T_{\\max}, 1/T_{\\min}]$. This ensures that the data points are uniformly distributed along the horizontal axis of the Arrhenius plot. For each $x_j$, we calculate the corresponding \"measured\" rate $k_{\\mathrm{true}}(1/x_j)$ and then its natural logarithm, $y_j = \\ln k_{\\mathrm{true}}(1/x_j)$. This gives the data set $\\{(x_j, y_j)\\}_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}}$.\n\n3.  **Perform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**: We fit a linear model $y \\approx b + mx$ to the synthetic data. The optimal slope $m$ and intercept $b$ are determined by the OLS estimators, which minimize the sum of squared residuals. The required formulas are:\n    $$\n    \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}} x_j\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}} y_j\n    $$\n    $$\n    m = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}} (x_j - \\bar{x})(y_j - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{fit}}} (x_j - \\bar{x})^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    b = \\bar{y} - m\\,\\bar{x}\n    $$\n    These estimators yield the best linear approximation to the $\\ln k_{\\mathrm{true}}$ curve in the least-squares sense over the fitting interval.\n\n4.  **Extract Effective Parameters**: The parameters from the linear fit are mapped back to the Arrhenius form to define an effective single-pathway model, $k_{\\mathrm{fit}}(T)$. The effective activation energy $E_{a,\\mathrm{fit}}$ and pre-exponential factor $A_{\\mathrm{fit}}$ are obtained by identification with the slope and intercept:\n    $$\n    E_{a,\\mathrm{fit}} = -mR\n    $$\n    $$\n    A_{\\mathrm{fit}} = \\exp(b)\n    $$\n    This leads to the approximating function:\n    $$\n    k_{\\mathrm{fit}}(T) = A_{\\mathrm{fit}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a,\\mathrm{fit}}}{RT}\\right)\n    $$\n\n5.  **Compute Extrapolation Error**: Finally, we evaluate both the true model $k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$ and the fitted model $k_{\\mathrm{fit}}(T)$ at the specified extrapolation temperatures $T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{pred}}$. The relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T)$ is then calculated for each of these temperatures:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{fit}}(T) - k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)}{k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)}\n    $$\nThis quantifies the failure of the single-pathway approximation outside the domain where it was calibrated.\n\nA special case arises when the activation energies of the two pathways are identical, i.e., $E_{a,1} = E_{a,2} = E_a$, as in Test Case 3. In this scenario, the true rate law simplifies to a perfect single-Arrhenius form:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{true}}(T) = A_1 e^{-E_a/RT} + A_2 e^{-E_a/RT} = (A_1 + A_2) e^{-E_a/RT}\n$$\nHere, the effective pre-exponential factor is simply $A_1 + A_2$. The corresponding Arrhenius plot is a true straight line. Therefore, the linear fit must be exact, resulting in $E_{a,\\mathrm{fit}} = E_a$ and $A_{\\mathrm{fit}} = A_1 + A_2$. The relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T)$ must be zero at all temperatures, within the limits of floating-point precision. This case serves as a necessary control for verifying the correctness of the implementation. For all other cases where $E_{a,1} \\neq E_{a,2}$, non-zero errors are expected.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of quantifying extrapolation error when a two-pathway\n    kinetic model is approximated by a single effective Arrhenius model.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 8.31446261815324  # J mol^-1 K^-1\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: balanced crossover\n        {\n            \"params\": ((1.0e13, 150.0), (1.0e9, 90.0)),\n            \"fit_window\": (600.0, 900.0),\n            \"n_fit\": 31,\n            \"pred_temps\": [450.0, 1100.0],\n        },\n        # Case 2: nearly degenerate activation energies\n        {\n            \"params\": ((1.0e12, 100.0), (1.0e12, 101.0)),\n            \"fit_window\": (500.0, 900.0),\n            \"n_fit\": 25,\n            \"pred_temps\": [350.0, 1200.0],\n        },\n        # Case 3: exactly degenerate activation energies\n        {\n            \"params\": ((2.0e11, 120.0), (8.0e11, 120.0)),\n            \"fit_window\": (500.0, 1000.0),\n            \"n_fit\": 20,\n            \"pred_temps\": [400.0, 1300.0],\n        },\n        # Case 4: strongly different barriers\n        {\n            \"params\": ((5.0e13, 180.0), (2.0e7, 60.0)),\n            \"fit_window\": (700.0, 900.0),\n            \"n_fit\": 21,\n            \"pred_temps\": [500.0, 1500.0],\n        },\n        # Case 5: narrow fit window\n        {\n            \"params\": ((3.0e12, 110.0), (5.0e10, 85.0)),\n            \"fit_window\": (750.0, 770.0),\n            \"n_fit\": 5,\n            \"pred_temps\": [400.0, 1000.0],\n        },\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Define the true model\n        (A1, Ea1_kj), (A2, Ea2_kj) = case[\"params\"]\n        Ea1 = Ea1_kj * 1000.0  # Convert kJ/mol to J/mol\n        Ea2 = Ea2_kj * 1000.0\n        \n        def k_true(T):\n            \"\"\"Calculates the true rate coefficient for the two-pathway model.\"\"\"\n            return A1 * np.exp(-Ea1 / (R * T)) + A2 * np.exp(-Ea2 / (R * T))\n\n        # Step 2: Generate synthetic data\n        T_min, T_max = case[\"fit_window\"]\n        N_fit = case[\"n_fit\"]\n        \n        # Temperatures are evenly spaced in reciprocal temperature x = 1/T\n        x_fit = np.linspace(1/T_max, 1/T_min, N_fit)\n        T_fit = 1 / x_fit\n        y_fit = np.log(k_true(T_fit))\n\n        # Step 3: Perform OLS regression\n        x_bar = np.mean(x_fit)\n        y_bar = np.mean(y_fit)\n        \n        numerator = np.sum((x_fit - x_bar) * (y_fit - y_bar))\n        denominator = np.sum((x_fit - x_bar)**2)\n        \n        m = numerator / denominator\n        b = y_bar - m * x_bar\n        \n        # Step 4: Extract effective parameters and define the fitted model\n        Ea_fit = -m * R\n        A_fit = np.exp(b)\n        \n        def k_fit(T):\n            \"\"\"Calculates the rate coefficient from the fitted single-pathway model.\"\"\"\n            return A_fit * np.exp(-Ea_fit / (R * T))\n            \n        # Step 5: Quantify extrapolation error\n        pred_temps = case[\"pred_temps\"]\n        case_results = []\n        for T_pred in pred_temps:\n            k_true_pred = k_true(T_pred)\n            k_fit_pred = k_fit(T_pred)\n            \n            rel_error = (k_fit_pred - k_true_pred) / k_true_pred\n            case_results.append(rel_error)\n        \n        all_results.append(case_results)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    formatted_results = [f\"[{res[0]},{res[1]}]\" for res in all_results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2683099"}]}
