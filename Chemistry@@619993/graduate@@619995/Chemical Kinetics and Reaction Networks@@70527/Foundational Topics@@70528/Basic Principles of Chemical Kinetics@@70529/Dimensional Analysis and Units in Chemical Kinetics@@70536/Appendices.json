The units of the universal gas constant $R$ are $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and the units of absolute temperature $T$ are $\\mathrm{K}$.

The units are consistent: $[\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{K}] = [\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}]$, as required.\n\nThe researcher, however, mistakenly plots $\\ln k$ versus $1/t$, where $t$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius ($^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). The mistaken two-point slope is:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mistaken}} = \\frac{\\ln k_2 - \\ln k_1}{1/t_2 - 1/t_1}\n$$\nThe units of this mistaken slope are $[m_{\\text{mistaken}}] = [1 / (1/^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})] = [^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}]$. The researcher then calculates a reported \"activation energy,\" which we denote as $E_{a, \\text{reported}}$, by multiplying this slope by $-R$:\n$$\nE_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}\n$$\nThe units of this reported quantity are $[R] \\cdot [m_{\\text{mistaken}}] = [\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}] \\cdot [^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}]$. This expression is dimensionally inconsistent. It is not a unit of energy, demonstrating the fundamental flaw in the researcher's procedure. The use of the Celsius scale, which is an interval scale and not a ratio scale, is invalid in a multiplicative physical relation like the Arrhenius law.\n\nTo derive a corrected expression for the true activation energy $E_a$, we relate the mistaken slope to the true energy. We start with the expression for the difference in the logarithm of the rate constants:\n$$\n\\ln k_2 - \\ln k_1 = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the mistaken slope:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mistaken}} = \\frac{-\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{t_2} - \\frac{1}{t_1}} = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}}{\\frac{t_1 - t_2}{t_1 t_2}}\n$$\nWe use the relation $T = t + 273.15$. It follows that a difference in temperature is the same in both scales: $T_1 - T_2 = (t_1 + 273.15) - (t_2 + 273.15) = t_1 - t_2$. The expression for the slope simplifies to:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mistaken}} = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2}\n$$\nThe researcher's reported energy is $E_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}$. Substituting the expression for $m_{\\text{mistaken}}$:\n$$\nE_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\left( -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = E_a \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2}\n$$\nTo recover the physically correct activation energy $E_a$ from the mistaken slope, we rearrange this equation. The reported energy is based on the mistaken slope, $E_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}$. The corrected expression for $E_a$ is therefore:\n$$\nE_a = E_{a, \\text{reported}} \\cdot \\frac{T_1 T_2}{t_1 t_2} = (-R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}) \\frac{T_1 T_2}{t_1 t_2}\n$$\nThis is the required corrected expression.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical ratio of the naively reported activation energy to the true activation energy for the specified temperatures. The ratio is $\\frac{E_{a, \\text{reported}}}{E_a}$. From our derivation above:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a, \\text{reported}}}{E_a} = \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2}\n$$\nThe given temperatures are $t_1 = 25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $t_2 = 45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.
