A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Correct Relationships\n\nThe solution requires establishing three key relationships: (i) between concentration $C_A(t)$ and extent of reaction $\\xi(t)$, (ii) between the rate of change of concentration $-\\dfrac{dC_A}{dt}$ and the rate of reaction $r$, and (iii) the integrated rate law and half-life.\n\n**Part (i): Relationship between $C_A(t)$ and $\\xi(t)$**\n\nThe problem provides the definition for the molar amount of any species $i$ as a function of the extent of reaction $\\xi(t)$:\n$$N_i(t) = N_{i0} + \\nu_i \\,\\xi(t)$$\nFor the reactant $A$ in the reaction $2A \\to P$, the stoichiometric number is $\\nu_A = -2$.\nThus, for species $A$:\n$$N_A(t) = N_{A0} - 2\\,\\xi(t)$$\nThe reactor volume $V$ is constant. The concentration $C_A(t)$ is defined as $C_A(t) = \\dfrac{N_A(t)}{V}$. Dividing the equation for $N_A(t)$ by $V$ gives:\n$$\\dfrac{N_A(t)}{V} = \\dfrac{N_{A0}}{V} - \\dfrac{2\\,\\xi(t)}{V}$$\nRecognizing that $C_A(t) = \\dfrac{N_A(t)}{V}$ and the initial concentration is $C_{A0} = \\dfrac{N_{A0}}{V}$, we get:\n$$C_A(t) = C_{A0} - \\dfrac{2\\,\\xi(t)}{V}$$\nThis is the correct relationship for part (i).\n\n**Part (ii): Relationship between $-\\dfrac{dC_A}{dt}$ and $r(t)$**\n\nTo find the relationship between the rates, we differentiate the expression for $C_A(t)$ from part (i) with respect to time $t$. Since $C_{A0}$ and $V$ are constants:\n$$\\dfrac{dC_A}{dt} = \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(C_{A0} - \\dfrac{2\\,\\xi(t)}{V}\\right) = -\\dfrac{2}{V}\\dfrac{d\\xi}{dt}$$\nThe problem defines the rate of reaction per unit volume as $r(t) = \\dfrac{1}{V}\\dfrac{d\\xi}{dt}$. Substituting this definition into the expression for $\\dfrac{dC_A}{dt}$:\n$$\\dfrac{dC_A}{dt} = -2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V}\\dfrac{d\\xi}{dt}\\right) = -2\\,r(t)$$\nThe rate of disappearance of $A$ is $-\\dfrac{dC_A}{dt}$.

The integral is the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC'}{C'} = \\left[\\ln(C')\\right]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right)\n$$\nEquating this to the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -K(t)\n$$\nSolving for $C(t)$ yields the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction with a time-dependent rate coefficient:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(-K(t))\n$$\n\nCase 2: The reaction order $n \\neq 1$.\nFor $n \\neq 1$, we use the power rule for integration:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} C'^{-n} dC' = \\left[\\frac{C'^{1-n}}{1-n}\\right]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = \\frac{C(t)^{1-n} - C_0^{1-n}}{1-n}\n$$\nEquating this to the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)^{1-n} - C_0^{1-n}}{1-n} = -K(t)\n$$\nWe solve for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(t)^{1-n} - C_0^{1-n} = -(1-n)K(t) = (n-1)K(t)\n$$\n$$\nC(t)^{1-n} = C_0^{1-n} + (n-1)K(t)\n$$\nThis leads to the general integrated rate law for an $n$-th order reaction ($n \\neq 1$):\n$$\nC(t) = \\left[C_0^{1-n} + (n-1)K(t)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-n}}\n$$\nFor a zero-order reaction ($n=0$), this simplifies to $C(t) = C_0 - K(t)$. Physically, the concentration cannot be negative, thus the reaction ceases when $C(t)=0$. The correct form is $C(t) = \\max(0, C_0 - K(t))$. For $n > 0$, since $C_0 > 0$ and the rate $dC/dt \\le 0$, the concentration $C(t)$ will approach zero asymptotically but never become negative.\n\nNext, we derive the condition for the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, which is the time at which $C(t_{1/2}) = C_0/2$.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_0}{2} = C_0 \\exp(-K(t_{1/2})) \\implies \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-K(t_{1/2})) \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -K(t_{1/2})\n$$\nThis gives the half-life condition for $n=1$:\n$$\nK(t_{1/2}) = \\ln(2)\n$$\n\nFor $n \\neq 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_0}{2} = \\left[C_0^{1-n} + (n-1)K(t_{1/2})\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-n}}\n$$\nRaise both sides to the power of $(1-n)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{C_0}{2}\\right)^{1-n} = C_0^{1-n} + (n-1)K(t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\nC_0^{1-n} 2^{-(1-n)} = C_0^{1-n} + (n-1)K(t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\nC_0^{1-n} (2^{n-1} - 1) = (n-1)K(t_{1/2})\n$$\nThis yields the half-life condition for $n \\neq 1$:\n$$\nK(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{C_0^{1-n}(2^{n-1} - 1)}{n-1}\n$$\nThese derived expressions form the basis of the analytical solution. The program will implement these formulas and validate them against numerical solutions obtained by direct quadrature and ODE integration, thereby confirming the correctness of the derivation through computational experiment.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad, solve_ivp\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function that defines and processes test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    TOLERANCE = 1e-8\n    REL_ERR_FLOOR = 1e-14\n\n    # Case A: n=1\n    case_a_params = {\n        'name': 'A', 'n': 1, 'C0': 1.5, 't_max': 2.0,\n        'k_func': lambda t: 0.8 * (1 + 0.4 * t),\n        'K_analytic_func': lambda t: 0.8 * (t + 0.4 * t**2 / 2),\n        't_half_solver': lambda k0, alpha, c0: (-k0 + np.sqrt(k0**2 + 2*k0*alpha*np.log(2))) / (k0*alpha)\n    }\n    case_a_params['t_half_args'] = {'k0': 0.8, 'alpha': 0.4, 'c0': 1.5}\n\n    # Case B: n=2\n    case_b_params = {\n        'name': 'B', 'n': 2, 'C0': 0.7, 't_max': 5.0,\n        'k_func': lambda t: 0.6 * np.exp(-0.3 * t),\n        'K_analytic_func': lambda t: (0.6 / 0.3) * (1 - np.exp(-0.3 * t)),\n        't_half_solver': lambda k0, beta, c0: (1/beta) * np.log((k0 * c0) / (k0 * c0 - beta))\n    }\n    case_b_params['t_half_args'] = {'k0': 0.6, 'beta': 0.3, 'c0': 0.7}\n\n    # Case C: n=0\n    case_c_params = {\n        'name': 'C', 'n': 0, 'C0': 2.0, 't_max': 3.0,\n        'k_func': lambda t: 0.5 * (1 + 0.5 * np.sin(1.2 * t)),\n        'K_analytic_func': lambda t: 0.5 * (t - (0.5 / 1.2) * (np.cos(1.2 * t) - 1)),\n        't_half_solver': lambda K_func, c0, t_max: brentq(lambda t: K_func(t) - c0 / 2, 0, t_max)\n    }\n    case_c_params['t_half_args'] = {\n        'K_func': case_c_params['K_analytic_func'], \n        'c0': 2.0, \n        't_max': 3.0\n    }\n\n    test_cases = [case_a_params, case_b_params, case_c_params]\n    \n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        results = process_case(case, TOLERANCE, REL_ERR_FLOOR)\n        all_results.extend(results)\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, all_results))}]\")\n\ndef process_case(params, tol, rel_err_floor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes a single test case: derives numerical solutions and validates them.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = params['n']\n    C0 = params['C0']\n    t_max = params['t_max']\n    k_func = params['k_func']\n    K_analytic_func = params['K_analytic_func']\n    t_half_solver = params['t_half_solver']\n    t_half_args = params['t_half_args']\n\n    t_grid = np.linspace(0, t_max, 301)\n    \n    # --- Analytic Solution ---\n    K_analytic = K_analytic_func(t_grid)\n    if n == 1:\n        C_analytic = C0 * np.exp(-K_analytic)\n    elif n == 0:\n        C_analytic = np.maximum(0, C0 - K_analytic)\n    else:\n        C_analytic = (C0**(1 - n) + (n - 1) * K_analytic)**(1 / (1 - n))\n\n    # --- Validation 1: ODE Integration ---\n    def dCdt(t, C):\n        if n == 0:\n            return -k_func(t) if C > 0 else 0.0\n        return -k_func(t) * C**n if C > 0 else 0.0\n\n    sol_ode = solve_ivp(dCdt, [0, t_max], [C0], t_eval=t_grid, rtol=1e-12, atol=1e-12)\n    C_ode = sol_ode.y.flatten()\n\n    rel_err_ode = np.max(np.abs(C_analytic - C_ode) / np.maximum(np.abs(C_analytic), rel_err_floor))\n    ode_valid = rel_err_ode < tol\n\n    # --- Validation 2: Numerical Quadrature ---\n    K_quad = np.array([quad(k_func, 0, t)[0] for t in t_grid])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        C_quad = C0 * np.exp(-K_quad)\n    elif n == 0:\n        C_quad = np.maximum(0, C0 - K_quad)\n    else:\n        C_quad = (C0**(1 - n) + (n - 1) * K_quad)**(1 / (1 - n))\n\n    rel_err_quad = np.max(np.abs(C_analytic - C_quad) / np.maximum(np.abs(C_analytic), rel_err_floor))\n    quad_valid = rel_err_quad < tol\n\n    # --- Validation 3: Half-Life ---\n    t_half = t_half_solver(**t_half_args)\n\n    sol_thalf = solve_ivp(dCdt, [0, t_half], [C0], t_eval=[t_half], rtol=1e-12, atol=1e-12)\n    C_at_thalf = sol_thalf.y[0, 0]\n    \n    thalf_valid_err = np.abs(C_at_thalf / C0 - 0.5)\n    thalf_valid = thalf_valid_err < tol\n\n    return [ode_valid, quad_valid, thalf_valid]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n\n```"}]}
