We can calculate this slope using any two data points from the first set.

The stoichiometric coefficients for both $\\text{A}$ and $\\text{B}$ are $1$. Our calculated orders are $m=1.5$ and $n=0.5$. The discrepancy is fundamental to chemical kinetics.\n\nThe concepts of molecularity and reaction order are distinct. Molecularity is a theoretical construct that applies only to elementary reactions, which are single-step processes occurring at the molecular level. For an elementary reaction, the rate law can be written directly from its stoichiometry. If the reaction $\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\to \\text{P}$ were an elementary step, its rate law would be $r = k[\\text{A}]^1[\\text{B}]^1$, and the orders would indeed be $m=1$ and $n=1$.\n\nHowever, most chemical reactions, including the one under consideration, are not elementary. They are complex reactions that proceed through a sequence of multiple elementary steps, collectively known as the reaction mechanism. The experimentally observed rate law (and thus the apparent orders $m$ and $n$) is a mathematical expression that describes the net rate of the overall transformation. This expression is a function of the rate constants of the individual elementary steps and often involves concentrations of short-lived reaction intermediates.\n\nThe functional form of the overall rate law is derived by analyzing the mechanism, typically using approximations such as the steady-state approximation for intermediates or the pre-equilibrium approximation for fast, reversible steps. Such derivations frequently lead to rate laws with complex, fractional, or even negative orders that bear no simple relationship to the stoichiometric coefficients of the overall balanced equation.\n\nIn this case, the determined orders $m=1.5$ and $n=0.5$ are fractional. The existence of fractional orders is irrefutable evidence that the reaction is not elementary but proceeds through a multi-step mechanism. The specific values of $m$ and $n$ are determined by the particular sequence of elementary steps and their relative rates. For instance, half-integer orders often arise in mechanisms involving pre-equilibrium dissociation of a dimer or in free-radical chain reactions. The apparent orders are empirical quantities reflecting the complexity of the underlying mechanism, whereas stoichiometric coefficients merely represent the overall mass balance of the reaction.\n\nIn summary, the apparent reaction orders ($m, n$) are experimentally determined parameters of the empirical rate law, while molecularity and stoichiometric coefficients are theoretical concepts related to the elementary steps and overall material balance, respectively. For a complex reaction, there is no a priori reason for the experimental orders to equal the stoichiometric coefficients. Our analysis confirms this principle.\n\nThe final calculation for the overall reaction order is:\n$$\\alpha = m + n = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2657347"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of many kinetic studies is to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism.
