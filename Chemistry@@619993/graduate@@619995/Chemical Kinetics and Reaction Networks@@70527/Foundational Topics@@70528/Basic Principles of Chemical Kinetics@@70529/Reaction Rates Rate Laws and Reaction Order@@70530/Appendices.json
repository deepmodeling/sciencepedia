From the second step of the mechanism, the rate is given by:\n$$\nv = k_{2}[\\mathrm{EA}]\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the steady-state concentration of $[\\mathrm{EA}]$ gives the final rate law:\n$$\nv = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}\n$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nFor the second task, we must derive the logarithmic sensitivity coefficients, $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. The definition is $s_{i} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln v}{\\partial \\ln k_{i}}$. Using the identity $\\frac{\\partial \\ln f}{\\partial \\ln x} = \\frac{x}{f}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, we have:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{1}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}}\n$$\nWe calculate the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $k_{1}$ using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{1}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{(k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}) - (k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])([\\mathrm{A}])}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2} + k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nNow we construct $s_{1}$:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{1}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}} \\left( \\frac{k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrmA}] + k_{2})^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})}{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]} \\frac{k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nAfter cancellation of common terms, we find the simple expression:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}\n$$\nSimilarly for $s_{2}$, we compute the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $k_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{2}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}) - (k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])(1)}{(k_{1}[\\mathrmA}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2} + k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nNow we construct $s_{2}$:\n$$\ns_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}} = \\frac{k_{2}}{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{2}(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})}{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]} \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nAfter cancellation, this simplifies to:\n$$\ns_{2} = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}\n$$\nNote that $s_{1} + s_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} + \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} = 1$, which is a required summation property for sensitivities in this system as the rate $v$ is a homogeneous function of degree $1$ in $(k_1, k_2)$.\n\nFor the third and fourth tasks, we evaluate these sensitivities using the given parameters and interpret the result.\nThe parameters are: $k_{1} = 2.4 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{2} = 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $[\\mathrm{A}] = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$. First, we compute the term $k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]$, which represents the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the binding step:\n$$\nk_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] = (2.4 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (9.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can compute the numerical values for $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} = \\frac{3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{3.2}{5.36} \\approx 0.5970149...\n$$\n$$\ns_{2} = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} = \\frac{2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2.16}{5.36} \\approx 0.402985...\n$$\nThe concept of a single rate-determining step (RDS) implies that one step is so much slower than all others that its rate constant alone controls the overall rate. In such a case, the sensitivity of the rate with respect to the RDS constant would be $s_{i} \\approx 1$, while for all other \"fast\" steps, $s_{j} \\approx 0$.\nIn this problem, the effective rates for the formation and breakdown of the intermediate are governed by the terms $k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]$ and $k_{2}$, respectively. We found these to be $2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These values are comparable; they are of the same order of magnitude.\nOur calculated sensitivities are $s_{1} \\approx 0.5970$ and $s_{2} \\approx 0.4030$. Neither coefficient is close to $1$ while the other is close to $0$. This indicates that both steps exert significant control over the overall rate $v$. The rate is sensitive to changes in both $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$. Thus, the simplistic picture of a single rate-determining step is invalid. Control is distributed between both steps. Step 1 (related to $k_1$) is the slower step ($k_1[A]  k_2$), and consistently, its sensitivity coefficient ($s_1$) is larger than that of step 2 ($s_2$), indicating it has slightly more rate control. This demonstrates quantitatively the breakdown of the RDS approximation when reaction barriers are comparable.\n\nThe final task is to report the value of $s_{1}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\ns_{1} \\approx 0.5970\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5970}\n$$", "id": "2668743"}]}
