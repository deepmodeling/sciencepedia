Therefore, we obtain:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(PEA)}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A]_{0}[B]_{0}\n$$\n\n2. Derivation using the Steady-State Approximation (SSA)\nThe steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of the reactive intermediate, $I$, is small and its rate of change is negligible compared to its rates of formation and consumption.

Assessment of Approximations and Justification\nTo ascertain which approximation is more suitable, we must test the validity conditions for each against the provided numerical data.\nThe condition for the validity of the PEA is that the reverse reaction of the first step ($I \\to A+B$) must be much faster than the second step ($I \\to P$). This translates to a comparison of their respective rate constants:\n$$\nk_{2} \\ll k_{-1}\n$$\nThe condition for the validity of the SSA is that the characteristic relaxation time of the intermediate, $\\tau_{I}$, must be much shorter than the characteristic time for reactant depletion, $\\tau_{A}$. The relaxation time for $I$ is $\\tau_{I} = (k_{-1} + k_{2})^{-1}$. The initial characteristic time for depletion of $A$ is $\\tau_{A} \\approx ([A]_{0})/(k_{1}[A]_{0}[B]_{0}) = 1/(k_{1}[B]_{0})$. Thus, the SSA is valid if $\\tau_{I} \\ll \\tau_{A}$, which means $(k_{-1} + k_{2})^{-1} \\ll (k_{1}[A]_{0})^{-1}$, or:\n$$\nk_{1}[A]_{0} \\ll k_{-1} + k_{2}\n$$\nLet us examine these conditions with the given values: $k_{1}=10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$, $k_{-1}=10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $k_{2}=10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $[A]_{0}=[B]_{0}=10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor PEA: $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$?\nWe have $10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\ll 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This inequality is strongly satisfied, as $k_{-1}$ is three orders of magnitude larger than $k_{2}$.\n\nFor SSA: $k_{1}[A]_{0} \\ll k_{-1} + k_{2}$?\nThe left side is $k_{1}[A]_{0} = (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}})(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nThe right side is $k_{-1} + k_{2} = 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 100100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nThe inequality is $10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\ll 100100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, which is also strongly satisfied.\n\nBoth approximations are mathematically valid. However, the PEA is a more specific condition than the SSA. The SSA expression for $[I]$ simplifies to the PEA expression in the limit where $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$, since $k_{-1} + k_{2} \\approx k_{-1}$. Because this limit is so clearly met in this problem, the system's behavior is more accurately and physically described as a rapid pre-equilibrium. Therefore, the pre-equilibrium approximation is the more appropriate choice.\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for the intermediate concentrations.\nBased on the PEA:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(PEA)}} = \\frac{10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}{10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})^{2} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nBased on the SSA:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(SSA)}} = \\frac{10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}{10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})^{2} = \\frac{10^{6}}{100100} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M} \\approx 9.990 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nAs established, the PEA is the more appropriate approximation.

Both mechanisms are plausible and correctly derived to match the given rate law. The rationale is scientifically sound.\n\n### Evaluation of Option B\n\n**Mechanism I (Langmuir–Hinshelwood):**\nThe mechanism involves adsorption of both A and B, followed by reaction between the adsorbed species: $\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{S}+\\mathrm{B}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{S}\\xrightarrow{k_2}\\text{products}+2\\mathrm{S}$.\nFollowing a standard derivation for this mechanism, the rate is $r = k_2 [\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{S}][\\mathrm{B}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{S}]$. With the site balance including both A and B, $S_T = [\\mathrm{S}] + [\\mathrm{A}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{S}] + [\\mathrm{B}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{S}]$, the final rate law is:\n$$r = \\frac{k_2 K_A K_B S_T^2 [\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]}{(1 + K_A[\\mathrm{A}] + K_B[\\mathrm{B}])^2}$$\nThis expression does not match the target rate law. The denominator is squared and contains a dependence on $[B]$. This mechanism is invalid.\n\n**Mechanism II (Pre-equilibrium dimerization):**\nThe mechanism is $2\\mathrm{A}\\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}_2$ followed by $\\mathrm{A}_2+\\mathrm{B}\\xrightarrow{k}\\text{products}$.\nThe rate is $r=k[\\mathrm{A}_2][\\mathrm{B}]$. From the pre-equilibrium, $[\\mathrm{A}_2]=K_{eq}[\\mathrm{A}]^2$.\nThus, the rate law is $r = k K_{eq} [\\mathrm{A}]^2 [\\mathrm{B}]$. This is second-order in A and does not have the required denominator. This mechanism is invalid.\n\n**Rationale:** The rationale is a vague statement that is unsupported by rigorous derivation.\n\n**Verdict on Option B:** **Incorrect**. Neither mechanism yields the correct rate law.\n\n### Evaluation of Option C\n\n**Mechanism I (Random-order Bi–Bi enzyme):**\nThe option provides the rate law $r=\\frac{V_{\\max}[A][B]}{K_A K_B+K_B[A]+K_A[B]+[A][B]}$. This contains terms dependent on $[B]$ in the denominator (specifically, $K_A[B]$ and $[A][B]$), which are not present in the target rate law. The form is incorrect.\n\n**Mechanism II (Competitive inhibition):**\nThis is described vaguely. If A is inhibiting the reaction of B, A is not a reactant forming product, contradicting the premise of a \"bimolecular reaction between species A and B\". If A is both substrate and inhibitor and B is a co-substrate, the resulting Michaelis-Menten-type expressions are more complex and do not generally simplify to the target form.\n\n**Rationale:** The rationale claims that setting $K_B \\to \\infty$ in the Bi-Bi rate law reproduces the target law. Let us test this. Dividing the numerator and denominator by $K_B$ gives $r=\\frac{(V_{\\max}/K_B)[A][B]}{K_A + [A] + (K_A/K_B)[B] + ([A][B]/K_B)}$. In the limit $K_B \\to \\infty$, the rate law becomes $r \\to \\frac{0}{K_A + [A]} = 0$. The rationale is mathematically false.\n\n**Verdict on Option C:** **Incorrect**. The proposed mechanisms and the rationale are incorrect.\n\n### Evaluation of Option D\n\n**Mechanism I (Pre-equilibrium encounter complex):**\nThe mechanism is $\\mathrm{A}+\\mathrm{B}\\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{AB}$ followed by $\\mathrm{AB}\\xrightarrow{k}\\text{products}$.\nThe rate is $r=k[\\mathrm{AB}]$. From the pre-equilibrium, $[\\mathrm{AB}] = K_{eq}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]$.\nThe rate law is $r = k K_{eq} [\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]$. This is a simple second-order rate law and does not match the target form.\n\n**Mechanism II (Third-body assisted recombination):**\nThe rate of the termolecular step $\\mathrm{A}+\\mathrm{B}+\\mathrm{M}\\xrightarrow{k_3}\\text{products}+\\mathrm{M}$ is $r = k_3[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{M}]$. If $[\\mathrm{M}]$ is constant, this is again a simple second-order rate law, $r = k'[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]$. It does not match the target form.\n\n**Rationale:** The rationale incorrectly invokes the concept of fall-off behavior from unimolecular reaction theory (Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism) and misapplies it to this bimolecular context.\n\n**Verdict on Option D:** **Incorrect**. The proposed mechanisms are incorrect, and the rationale is confused.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly Option A correctly provides two distinct, plausible mechanisms that both derive the given empirical rate law, and it provides a correct and fundamental explanation for why kinetic data alone are insufficient to distinguish between them.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2954070"}]}
