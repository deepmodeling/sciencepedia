It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem from the field of chemical kinetics. It is a standard exercise in solving a first-order ordinary differential equation and performing a sensitivity analysis, both of which are fundamental procedures. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe dynamics of the concentration of species $A$, denoted $x_A(t)$, are described by the initial value problem:\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{dt} = -k x_A, \\quad x_A(0) = x_0 $$\nwhere $k > 0$ and $x_0 > 0$. This is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The equation is separable and can be solved by direct integration.\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{x_A} = -k dt $$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$.\n$$ \\int_{x_A(0)}^{x_A(t)} \\frac{1}{\\xi} d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{t} -k d\\tau $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ [\\ln|\\xi|]_{x_0}^{x_A(t)} = [-k\\tau]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln|x_A(t)| - \\ln|x_0| = -kt $$\nGiven that concentration $x_A$ must be non-negative, and the initial concentration $x_0$ is positive, $x_A(t)$ will remain positive for all finite time $t$. Therefore, the absolute value signs can be removed.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_A(t)}{x_0}\\right) = -kt $$\nBy exponentiating both sides, we obtain the closed-form solution for the concentration profile:\n$$ x_A(t) = x_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nThe second task is to compute the local sensitivity coefficient of $x_A(t)$ with respect to the parameter $k$, which is defined as $S_k(t) = \\frac{\\partial x_A(t)}{\\partial k}$. We can compute this directly by differentiating the derived expression for $x_A(t)$ with respect to $k$, treating $x_0$ and $t$ as constants.\n$$ S_k(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left( x_0 \\exp(-kt) \\right) $$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we find:\n$$ S_k(t) = x_0 \\cdot \\exp(-kt) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(-kt) $$\n$$ S_k(t) = x_0 \\exp(-kt) (-t) $$\nThus, the closed-form expression for the sensitivity coefficient is:\n$$ S_k(t) = -t x_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\n\nThe final task is to analyze the behavior of the magnitude of the sensitivity, $|S_k(t)|$, and find its maximum. Since $t \\ge 0$, $x_0 > 0$, and $\\exp(-kt) > 0$, the magnitude is:\n$$ |S_k(t)| = t x_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\n\nBehavior for small $t$: For $t \\to 0^{+}$, we can analyze the behavior by considering the Taylor series expansion of the exponential term, $\\exp(-kt) \\approx 1 - kt + \\mathcal{O}((kt)^{2})$.\n$$ |S_k(t)| \\approx t x_0 (1 - kt) = x_0t - kx_0t^{2} $$\nFor small $t$, the linear term dominates, so $|S_k(t)|$ scales linearly with time, i.e., $|S_k(t)| \\propto t$. This is physically intuitive: at $t=0$, no reaction has occurred, so the concentration $x_A(0)=x_0$ is independent of $k$, making the sensitivity zero. As the reaction begins, the concentration becomes increasingly dependent on the rate constant $k$.\n\nBehavior for large $t$: For $t \\to \\infty$, the exponential term $\\exp(-kt)$ decays to zero much faster than the linear term $t$ grows. We can evaluate the limit formally:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} |S_k(t)| = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} t x_0 \\exp(-kt) = x_0 \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{t}{\\exp(kt)} $$\nThis is an indeterminate form $\\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$. Applying L'Hôpital's rule:\n$$ x_0 \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dt}(t)}{\\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(kt))} = x_0 \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k \\exp(kt)} = 0 $$\nThus, $|S_k(t)| \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This is also physically sound: after a long duration, the reaction approaches completion ($x_A \\to 0$), and this final state is independent of the specific value of $k$ (as long as $k>0$). The state of the system becomes insensitive to the rate at which it reached that state.\n\nTo find the time at which $|S_k(t)|$ is maximized, we must find the critical points by setting its first derivative with respect to time to zero.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}|S_k(t)| = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( t x_0 \\exp(-kt) \\right) $$\nUsing the product rule:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}|S_k(t)| = x_0 \\left[ (1)\\exp(-kt) + t(-k \\exp(-kt)) \\right] = x_0 \\exp(-kt) (1-kt) $$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$ x_0 \\exp(-kt) (1-kt) = 0 $$\nSince $x_0 > 0$ and $\\exp(-kt) > 0$, the equation is satisfied only if $1-kt = 0$. This gives the time of maximum sensitivity:\n$$ t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{k} $$\nThis time corresponds to the characteristic time constant of the first-order decay process. To confirm it is a maximum, we can examine the sign of the second derivative, or simply note that $|S_k(0)|=0$ and $|S_k(t)| \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, and $t=1/k$ is the sole positive critical point. The function must therefore attain its maximum here.\n\nThe maximal magnitude of the sensitivity is found by substituting $t_{\\text{max}}$ into the expression for $|S_k(t)|$:\n$$ |S_k(t_{\\text{max}})| = \\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right) x_0 \\exp\\left(-k\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{x_0}{k} \\exp(-1) = \\frac{x_0}{ke} $$\nIn summary, the sensitivity of the concentration $x_A$ to the rate constant $k$ is zero initially, increases to a maximum value of $\\frac{x_0}{ke}$ at the characteristic time $t=1/k$, and then decays to zero as the reaction reaches completion. This time represents the point where a small relative change in the rate constant $k$ has the largest absolute impact on the concentration of species $A$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-t x_{0} \\exp(-k t)}\n$$", "id": "2692536"}, {"introduction": "A model's sensitivity to a parameter is a key ingredient in determining our ability to estimate that parameter from experimental data.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles.\nFirst, we must solve the ordinary differential equation that governs the concentration of species $A$, $x_A(t)$. The equation is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_A}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k x_A$. This is a separable first-order linear differential equation.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_A}{x_A} = -k \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from time $0$ to $t$ and from concentration $x_A(0)$ to $x_A(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_A(0)}^{x_A(t)} \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi = \\int_0^t -k \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(x_A(t)) - \\ln(x_A(0)) = -kt\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $x_A(0) = x_0$, we have:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_A(t)}{x_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the concentration profile:\n$$\nx_A(t) = x_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe observation model is $y_i = x_A(t_i) + \\varepsilon_i$, where $\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. This implies that each measurement $y_i$ is a random variable drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu_i = x_A(t_i)$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. The probability density function for a single measurement $y_i$ given the parameter $k$ is:\n$$\np(y_i | k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - x_A(t_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe Fisher information provides a measure of the amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter upon which the probability of the random variable depends. For a single parameter $\\theta$ and observations corrupted by independent, additive, zero-mean Gaussian noise with constant variance $\\sigma^2$, the Fisher information simplifies to a sum over all measurements:\n$$\nF_{\\theta\\theta}(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)^2\n$$\nIn our problem, the parameter is $\\theta = k$ and the mean of the measurement at time $t_i$ is $\\mu_i = x_A(t_i; k)$. Thus, the scalar Fisher information for $k$, denoted $F_{kk}(k)$, is:\n$$\nF_{kk}(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial x_A(t_i)}{\\partial k} \\right)^2\n$$\nWe must compute the partial derivative of the state $x_A(t)$ with respect to the parameter $k$. This derivative is known as the sensitivity of the state with respect to the parameter.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_A(t)}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left( x_0 \\exp(-kt) \\right)\n$$\nSince $x_0$ and $t$ are not functions of $k$, we apply the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_A(t)}{\\partial k} = x_0 \\exp(-kt) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(-kt) = x_0 \\exp(-kt) \\cdot (-t) = -t x_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this sensitivity expression back into the formula for the Fisher information:\n$$\nF_{kk}(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left( -t_i x_0 \\exp(-kt_i) \\right)^2\n$$\nSimplifying the expression within the sum:\n$$\nF_{kk}(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left( t_i^2 x_0^2 \\exp(-2kt_i) \\right)\n$$\nSince $x_0$ and $\\sigma^2$ are constant for all measurements, they can be factored out of the summation:\n$$\nF_{kk}(k) = \\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the Fisher information for the rate constant $k$. The units of $x_0$ and $\\sigma$ are concentration, making the ratio $x_0^2/\\sigma^2$ dimensionless. The rate constant $k$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and time $t_i$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}$, so the argument of the exponential, $-2kt_i$, is dimensionless. The term $t_i^2$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^2$, and therefore the entire expression for $F_{kk}(k)$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^2$, as required.\n\nNext, we analyze the sampling time $t^\\star$ that maximizes the per-sample contribution to the Fisher information. The contribution from a single sample taken at time $t$ is the summand:\n$$\nf(t; k) = \\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2} t^2 \\exp(-2kt)\n$$\nTo find the time $t$ that maximizes this function, we compute its derivative with respect to $t$ and set it to zero.

Let $g(t) = t^2 \\exp(-2kt)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( t^2 \\exp(-2kt) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (2t) \\exp(-2kt) + t^2 \\exp(-2kt) \\cdot (-2k) = (2t - 2kt^2) \\exp(-2kt)\n$$\nWe set the derivative to zero to find the critical points:\n$$\n(2t - 2kt^2) \\exp(-2kt) = 2t(1-kt) \\exp(-2kt) = 0\n$$\nFor physically meaningful time $t > 0$, the term $2t \\exp(-2kt)$ is always positive. Therefore, the extremum occurs when:\n$$\n1-kt = 0 \\implies kt = 1 \\implies t^\\star = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we examine the second derivative.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2g}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( (2t - 2kt^2) \\exp(-2kt) \\right) = (2 - 4kt)\\exp(-2kt) + (2t - 2kt^2)(-2k)\\exp(-2kt)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2g}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = (2 - 4kt - 4kt + 4k^2t^2)\\exp(-2kt) = (2 - 8kt + 4k^2t^2)\\exp(-2kt)\n$$\nEvaluating at $t = t^\\star = 1/k$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2g}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} \\right|_{t=1/k} = (2 - 8k(1/k) + 4k^2(1/k)^2)\\exp(-2k(1/k)) = (2 - 8 + 4)\\exp(-2) = -2\\exp(-2)\n$$\nSince the second derivative is negative, $t^\\star = 1/k$ is indeed a local maximum. As $g(t) \\to 0$ for $t \\to 0^+$ and $g(t) \\to 0$ for $t \\to \\infty$, this is the global maximum for $t>0$.\n\nThe existence of this optimal sampling time reflects a fundamental trade-off. The information content is proportional to the square of the sensitivity, $(\\frac{\\partial x_A}{\\partial k})^2 = t^2 x_A(t)^2$. This expression contains two competing factors. The $t^2$ factor indicates that sensitivity to $k$ increases with time; waiting longer allows the effect of the rate to accumulate. However, the $x_A(t)^2 = (x_0 \\exp(-kt))^2$ factor indicates that as time progresses, the reactant concentration decays exponentially. As the concentration approaches zero, the signal-to-noise ratio diminishes, and measurements become less informative. The optimal sampling time $t^\\star = 1/k$, which is the characteristic time constant of the reaction, represents the point where this trade-off is perfectly balanced. At this time, the concentration has decayed to $x_A(1/k) = x_0 \\exp(-1)$, a value that is substantially different from the initial state but still large enough to be measured with reasonable precision.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{x_0^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n t_i^2 \\exp(-2kt_i)}\n$$", "id": "2692578"}, {"introduction": "Beyond quantifying uncertainty in existing parameters, a crucial task in modeling is to decide between competing model structures.

The log-likelihood function $\\ell(k_1, k_2)$ for the entire dataset $\\{(t_i, y_{B,i}, y_{C,i})\\}_{i=1}^n$ is the sum of the log-probabilities for each independent measurement:\n$$\n\\ell(k_1, k_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( -\\frac{(y_{B,i} - B(t_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{(y_{C,i} - C(t_i))^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) \\right)\n$$\nMaximizing this log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing its negative, which, after removing constant terms, is equivalent to minimizing the weighted sum of squared residuals (SSR). Since the variances are constant, this simplifies to minimizing the unweighted SSR, defined as:\n$$\nS(k_1, k_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ (y_{B,i} - B(t_i | k_1, k_2))^2 + (y_{C,i} - C(t_i | k_1, k_2))^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) of the parameters are the values that minimize this SSR function.\n\nThe problem poses a hypothesis test. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, posits that the pathway $A \\rightarrow B$ does not exist, while the alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, represents the full model. The rate constants must be non-negative.\n- Null Hypothesis $H_0: k_1 = 0$, with $k_2 \\ge 0$ as a nuisance parameter.\n- Alternative Hypothesis $H_1: k_1 > 0$, with $k_2 \\ge 0$ as a nuisance parameter. The MLE is found over the space $k_1 \\ge 0, k_2 \\ge 0$.\n\nTo perform the LRT, we find the MLEs under both hypotheses by minimizing the SSR:\n1.  Under $H_1$, we find $(\\widehat{k}_1, \\widehat{k}_2) = \\text{argmin}_{k_1 \\ge 0, k_2 \\ge 0} S(k_1, k_2)$. Let the minimum SSR be $\\widehat{S}_1 = S(\\widehat{k}_1, \\widehat{k}_2)$. This requires a $2$-dimensional constrained numerical optimization.\n2.  Under $H_0$, we set $k_1 = 0$. The model simplifies to $B(t) = 0$ and $C(t) = A_0(1 - e^{-k_2 t})$. We find $\\widehat{k}_2^{(0)} = \\text{argmin}_{k_2 \\ge 0} S(0, k_2)$. Let the minimum SSR be $\\widehat{S}_0 = S(0, \\widehat{k}_2^{(0)})$. This is a $1$-dimensional constrained numerical optimization.\n\nThe likelihood ratio test statistic $\\Lambda$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 2 \\left(\\ell(\\widehat{k}_1, \\widehat{k}_2) - \\ell(0, \\widehat{k}_2^{(0)})\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the log-likelihood in terms of the SSR values:\n$$\n\\Lambda = 2 \\left( \\left(-\\frac{\\widehat{S}_1}{2\\sigma^2} - C\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\widehat{S}_0}{2\\sigma^2} - C\\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\widehat{S}_0 - \\widehat{S}_1}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\nwhere $C$ represents the constant terms. Since $H_0$ is a nested sub-model of $H_1$, it must be that $\\widehat{S}_0 \\ge \\widehat{S}_1$ and thus $\\Lambda \\ge 0$. Any numerically negative value for $\\Lambda$ due to optimizer tolerance is set to $0$.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, and subject to standard regularity conditions, $\\Lambda$ follows a chi-squared distribution. The number of degrees of freedom is the difference in the number of free parameters between $H_1$ and $H_0$, which is $2 - 1 = 1$. The problem specifies using the $\\chi^2_1$ distribution. The $p$-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one computed, assuming $H_0$ is true:\n$$\np = P(\\chi^2_1 \\ge \\Lambda) = 1 - F_{\\chi^2_1}(\\Lambda)\n$$\nwhere $F_{\\chi^2_1}$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Generate a noise-free dataset $\\{ (t_i, y_{B,i}, y_{C,i}) \\}$ using the analytical solutions for $B(t)$ and $C(t)$ with the given \"true\" parameters $k_1^\\star$ and $k_2^\\star$.\n2.  Define the objective functions for the SSR, $S(k_1, k_2)$ for $H_1$ and $S(0, k_2)$ for $H_0$.\n3.  Use a numerical optimization algorithm (e.g., L-BFGS-B from SciPy) to find the minimum SSR under each hypothesis, $\\widehat{S}_1$ and $\\widehat{S}_0$, subject to non-negativity constraints on the rate constants.\n4.  Calculate the LRT statistic $\\Lambda = \\max(0, (\\widehat{S}_0 - \\widehat{S}_1)/\\sigma^2)$.\n5.  Compute the $p$-value using the $\\chi^2_1$ CDF.\nThis procedure will be implemented for the $3$ provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a Likelihood Ratio Test for a branched first-order reaction network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define problem constants\n    A0 = 1.0\n    SIGMA = 2.0e-2\n\n    # Test cases from the problem statement\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"times\": np.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]),\n            \"k1_true\": 0.25,\n            \"k2_true\": 0.50,\n        },\n        {\n            \"times\": np.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]),\n            \"k1_true\": 0.0,\n            \"k2_true\": 0.50,\n        },\n        {\n            \"times\": np.array([0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]),\n            \"k1_true\": 0.05,\n            \"k2_true\": 0.50,\n        },\n    ]\n\n    p_values = []\n\n    def model_full(t, k1, k2):\n        \"\"\"Analytical solution for B(t) and C(t) for the full model.\"\"\"\n        k_sum = k1 + k2\n        t = np.asarray(t)\n        \n        # Handle the case k1+k2 -> 0 to avoid numerical instability\n        if np.abs(k_sum) < 1e-9:\n            B = k1 * A0 * t\n            C = k2 * A0 * t\n        else:\n            # Use of np.expm1 to maintain precision for small arguments\n            term = -k_sum * t\n            factor = -np.expm1(term) / k_sum\n            B = k1 * A0 * factor\n            C = k2 * A0 * factor\n        return B, C\n\n    def model_H0(t, k2):\n        \"\"\"Analytical solution for C(t) under H0 (k1=0).
