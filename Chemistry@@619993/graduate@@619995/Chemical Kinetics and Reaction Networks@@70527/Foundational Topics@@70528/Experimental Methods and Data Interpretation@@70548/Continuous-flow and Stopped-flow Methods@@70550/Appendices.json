The parameters provided are physically realistic for a microfluidic experiment with an aqueous solution. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent data to determine a unique solution for the requested differential pressure. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds from fundamental definitions. The dead time, $t_{\\mathrm{d}}$, is the time required for a fluid parcel to travel the dead distance, $L_{\\mathrm{dead}}$. The average velocity of the fluid, $\\bar{v}$, is therefore defined by the relation:\n$$ \\bar{v} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{dead}}}{t_{\\mathrm{d}}} $$\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, through the circular capillary of cross-sectional area $A = \\pi R^2$ is given by:\n$$ Q = A \\bar{v} = (\\pi R^2) \\left(\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{dead}}}{t_{\\mathrm{d}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi R^2 L_{\\mathrm{dead}}}{t_{\\mathrm{d}}} $$\nThe flow is assumed to be steady, incompressible, and laminar. For such flow in a circular tube of length $L$ and radius $R$, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation relates the volumetric flow rate $Q$ to the pressure drop across the tube, $\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{inlet}} - P_{\\mathrm{outlet}}$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} $$\nThe problem requires finding the differential pressure $\\Delta P$ needed to achieve the target dead time. We equate the two expressions for $Q$:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi R^2 L_{\\mathrm{dead}}}{t_{\\mathrm{d}}} = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} $$\nSolving this equation for the required differential pressure $\\Delta P$:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{ \\pi R^4} \\left( \\frac{\\pi R^2 L_{\\mathrm{dead}}}{t_{\\mathrm{d}}} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the expression yields the symbolic solution for $\\Delta P$:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\mu L L_{\\mathrm{dead}}}{R^2 t_{\\mathrm{d}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) (0.120\\ \\mathrm{m}) (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{(4.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s})} $$\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.120 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{9.60 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-12}}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 6.00 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThe problem requests the answer in megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$).\n$$ \\Delta P = 6.00 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 0.600\\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nNext, we must validate the auxiliary conditions as requested.\n\nFirst, we check the assumption of laminar flow by calculating the Reynolds number, $Re$.\nThe required average velocity is $\\bar{v} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\nThe Reynolds number is defined as $Re = \\frac{\\rho \\bar{v} D}{\\mu}$, where $D = 2R$ is the tube diameter.\n$$ Re = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}) (1.00\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) (2 \\times 4.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}} $$\n$$ Re = \\frac{8.00 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = 80.0 $$\nSince $Re = 80.0$ is significantly less than the critical Reynolds number for transition to turbulence in a pipe (typically $Re_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 2300$), the assumption of laminar flow is fully justified.\n\nSecond, we evaluate the risk of cavitation. Cavitation occurs if the local pressure anywhere in the fluid drops to or below its vapor pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 3.17 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. In Poiseuille flow, the pressure decreases linearly along the length of the tube. The minimum pressure occurs at the outlet, $x=L$. The problem states the fluid discharges to ambient pressure, so the pressure at the outlet is $P(L) = P_{\\mathrm{outlet}} = P_{\\mathrm{amb}} = 1.013 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. Since the minimum pressure in the system, $1.013 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, is much greater than the vapor pressure, $3.17 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, there is no concern of cavitation.\n\nThird, we check if the syringe drive can supply the required pressure. The required differential pressure is $\\Delta P = P_{\\mathrm{inlet}} - P_{\\mathrm{outlet}}$. This is the gauge pressure that must be applied at the inlet relative to the outlet ambient pressure. We calculated $\\Delta P = 0.600 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. The maximum gauge pressure capacity of the syringe drive is given as $P_{\\max} = 0.800 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. Since the required pressure ($0.600 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$) is less than the maximum capacity of the pump ($0.800 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$), the syringe drive is adequate for this experiment.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. The required differential pressure, rounded to three significant figures, is $0.600\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.600}\n$$", "id": "2636824"}, {"introduction": "In stopped-flow spectroscopy, the ideal of an instantaneous and stable halt of the reacting solution is often compromised by mechanical artifacts.
