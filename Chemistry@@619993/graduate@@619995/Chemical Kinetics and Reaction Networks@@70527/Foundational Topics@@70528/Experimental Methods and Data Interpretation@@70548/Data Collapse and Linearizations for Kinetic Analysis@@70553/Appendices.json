Substituting $[B] = C_{\\mathrm{T}} - [A]$ into the rate equation eliminates $[B]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{f}}[A] + k_{\\mathrm{r}}(C_{\\mathrm{T}} - [A]) = -(k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}})[A] + k_{\\mathrm{r}}C_{\\mathrm{T}}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $[A](t)$. At equilibrium ($t \\to \\infty$), the net rate is zero, so $\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = 0$, and the concentrations are $[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and $[B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. This gives:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{f}}[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_{\\mathrm{r}}[B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nUsing the conservation law at equilibrium, $[B]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{T}} - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we have:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{f}}[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_{\\mathrm{r}}(C_{\\mathrm{T}} - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}) \\implies k_{\\mathrm{r}}C_{\\mathrm{T}} = (k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}})[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for $k_{\\mathrm{r}}C_{\\mathrm{T}}$ back into the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -(k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}})[A] + (k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}})[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -(k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}})\\big([A] - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\big)\n$$\nLet us define the relaxation rate constant $\\lambda = k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -\\lambda\\big([A] - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\big)\n$$\nThis ODE can be solved by separation of variables with the initial condition $[A](t=0) = [A]_0$:\n$$\n\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A](t)} \\frac{d[A]'}{[A]' - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = -\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda \\,dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{[A](t) - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[A]_0 - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the general solution for $[A](t)$:\n$$\n[A](t) = [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} + ([A]_0 - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}})\\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nTo collapse the data from both experiments onto a single curve, we define a dimensionless variable $z(t)$ that normalizes the deviation from equilibrium by the initial deviation from equilibrium:\n$$\nz(t) = \\frac{[A](t) - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[A]_0 - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\n$$\nFrom the integrated rate law, we see that $z(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. This equation is independent of the initial concentration $[A]_0$, so plotting $z(t)$ versus $t$ will cause the data from both experiments to \"collapse\" onto a single exponential decay curve.\nTo estimate the relaxation rate $\\lambda$, we linearize the expression for $z(t)$ by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(z(t)) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nThis equation shows that a plot of $\\ln(z(t))$ versus $t$ should yield a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of $-\\lambda$.\n\nNow, we process the experimental data. We are given $[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.250$ mM.\nFor Experiment $1$: $[A]_0 = 1.000$ mM. The denominator for $z(t)$ is $[A]_0 - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 1.000 - 0.250 = 0.750$ mM.\n- At $t=25$ s: $z(25) = \\frac{0.525909 - 0.250}{0.750} = \\frac{0.275909}{0.750} \\approx 0.367879$. Then $\\ln(z(25)) \\approx -1.00000$.\n- At $t=50$ s: $z(50) = \\frac{0.351501 - 0.250}{0.750} = \\frac{0.101501}{0.750} \\approx 0.135335$. Then $\\ln(z(50)) \\approx -2.00000$.\n\nFor Experiment $2$: $[A]_0 = 0.100$ mM. The denominator for $z(t)$ is $[A]_0 - [A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.100 - 0.250 = -0.150$ mM.\n- At $t=25$ s: $z(25) = \\frac{0.194818 - 0.250}{-0.150} = \\frac{-0.055182}{-0.150} \\approx 0.367880$. Then $\\ln(z(25)) \\approx -1.00000$.\n- At $t=50$ s: $z(50) = \\frac{0.229700 - 0.250}{-0.150} = \\frac{-0.020300}{-0.150} \\approx 0.135333$. Then $\\ln(z(50)) \\approx -2.00000$.\n\nThe data from both experiments collapse perfectly. The relationship is clearly $\\ln(z(t)) = -m \\cdot t$ where the slope is $m$. From any data point, for instance at $t=25$ s, we have $\\ln(z(25)) = -1.00000$. The slope of the line $\\ln(z(t))$ vs. $t$ is $-\\lambda = \\frac{-1.00000}{25 \\text{ s}} = -0.04000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\nTherefore, the relaxation rate is $\\lambda = 0.04000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the individual rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$ using two relationships:\n1. The relaxation rate: $\\lambda = k_{\\mathrm{f}} + k_{\\mathrm{r}} = 0.04000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n2. The equilibrium condition: The equilibrium constant is $K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}}} = \\frac{[B]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$.\nWe are given $C_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1.000$ mM and $[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.250$ mM.

This process culminates in using the Arrhenius linearization to determine the reaction's activation energy, linking kinetic rates to their fundamental temperature dependence [@problem_id:2637195].", "problem": "You are given multiple isothermal decay datasets for a single-step unimolecular reaction, each collected at a distinct absolute temperature. Assume that the decay obeys first-order kinetics at each temperature and that the rate constant follows an Arrhenius temperature dependence. Your task is to design a program that, for each dataset, performs two coupled analyses central to data collapse and kinetic linearization: (i) determine the temperature shift factor that collapses the concentration-versus-time curves onto a common master curve via reduced time, and (ii) infer an activation energy from an Arrhenius linearization. Your program must use only the numerical data and definitions below, without any external input.\n\nFundamental base and definitions to use:\n- First-order kinetics at fixed temperature: the concentration $C(t;T)$ of a single species satisfies the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t}=-k(T)C$, where $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent rate constant and $t$ is time.\n- Arrhenius law: the temperature dependence of the rate constant is $k(T)=A\\exp\\left(-E_{\\mathrm{a}}/(RT)\\right)$, where $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n- Data collapse via reduced time: define the reduced time $\\tau(T)=a_T t$, where $a_T$ is a dimensionless temperature shift factor chosen to collapse $C(t;T)$ across different $T$ onto a master curve when plotted versus $\\tau$ using a common reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. By construction, $a_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}=1$.\n\nRequired analysis steps for each dataset:\n- Using the first-order kinetics definition, determine $k(T)$ at each temperature by a linearization that is valid for first-order decay at fixed $T$. Treat $C(t;T)$ as the observable; do not assume the values of $A$ or $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ are known when estimating $k(T)$.\n- With a chosen $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ for the dataset, compute the temperature shift factors $a_T$ that collapse the curves across temperatures under the reduced time definition. Ensure $a_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}=1$ by definition and $a_T$ is dimensionless.\n- Using the Arrhenius definition, infer $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ by an appropriate linearization based on the estimated $k(T)$ values, and report it in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol).\n\nNumerical constants and units to use:\n- The universal gas constant is $R=8.314462618$ in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Time must be in $\\mathrm{s}$, temperature in $\\mathrm{K}$, concentration in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n- Report the activation energy in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ as a floating-point value rounded to two decimal places.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of first-order reaction kinetics and the Arrhenius law for the temperature dependence of rate constants. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and data to construct a unique and meaningful solution. It is objective, complete, and does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. The task is to implement a sequence of standard linearization and data-collapse procedures.\n\nThe solution is approached in three principal steps for each dataset, as dictated by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we must determine the first-order rate constant, $k(T)$, at each given temperature $T$. The governing differential equation for a single-step unimolecular decay is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k(T)C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration of the reactant, $t$ is time, and $k(T)$ is the rate constant at absolute temperature $T$. This ordinary differential equation is separable and can be integrated from an initial condition $C(t=0) = C_0$ to a later time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{C} = -k(T) \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{d}t'\n$$\nThis integration yields the familiar exponential decay law:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -k(T)t \\implies C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k(T)t)\n$$\nTo determine $k(T)$ from a set of concentration measurements $(t_i, C_i)$ at a fixed temperature, we linearize the exponential decay equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) = \\ln(C_0) - k(T)t\n$$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = m x + c$, where $y = \\ln(C)$, $x = t$, the intercept is $c = \\ln(C_0)$, and the slope is $m = -k(T)$. Therefore, for each temperature, we perform a linear regression on the data pairs $(\\,t_i, \\ln(C_i)\\,)$. The rate constant is then extracted from the resulting slope: $k(T) = -m$.\n\nSecond, we compute the temperature shift factors, $a_T$, required for data collapse onto a master curve. The reduced time is defined as $\\tau = a_T t$. The principle of data collapse posits that all concentration curves $C(t; T)$ should map onto a single function, $C_{\\text{master}}(\\tau)$, when plotted against $\\tau$. A reference temperature, $T_{\\text{ref}}$, is chosen, for which the shift factor is unity by definition, $a_{T_{\\text{ref}}} = 1$. The master curve is thus the concentration profile at the reference temperature:\n$$\nC_{\\text{master}}(\\tau) = C(t=\\tau; T_{\\text{ref}}) = C_0 \\exp(-k(T_{\\text{ref}})\\tau)\n$$\nFor any other temperature $T$, the concentration profile is $C(t; T) = C_0 \\exp(-k(T)t)$. To achieve collapse, this must be expressible as a function of only $\\tau$. Substituting $t = \\tau/a_T$:\n$$\nC(t; T) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-k(T)\\frac{\\tau}{a_T}\\right)\n$$\nFor this to be identical to $C_{\\text{master}}(\\tau)$, the exponents must be equal for all $\\tau$:\n$$\n-k(T)\\frac{\\tau}{a_T} = -k(T_{\\text{ref}})\\tau\n$$\nSolving for the shift factor $a_T$ gives a direct relationship with the rate constants:\n$$\na_T = \\frac{k(T)}{k(T_{\\text{ref}})}\n$$\nThis formula is used to calculate the shift factor for each temperature $T$, using the rate constants $k(T)$ determined in the first step and the rate constant at the specified reference temperature, $k(T_{\\text{ref}})$.\n\nThird, we determine the activation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$, from the temperature dependence of the rate constants. The Arrhenius law provides this relationship:\n$$\nk(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation energy, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. Similar to the previous steps, we linearize this equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(k(T)) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{R} \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nThis equation is again of the linear form $y = m x + c$, where $y = \\ln(k(T))$, $x = 1/T$, the intercept is $c = \\ln(A)$, and the slope is $m = -E_{\\mathrm{a}}/R$. We perform a linear regression on the data pairs $(\\,1/T_j, \\ln(k(T_j))\\,)$, where the $k(T_j)$ values were obtained in the first step. The activation energy is then calculated from the slope of this fit:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{a}} = -m \\cdot R\n$$\nThe universal gas constant $R$ is given as $8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. The resulting $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ will be in units of $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, which must then be converted to $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ by dividing by $1000$.\n\nThe overall process is as follows:\n For each dataset provided:\n 1. Define the parameters for data generation: generating $A$ and $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$, temperatures $T_j$, reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$, initial concentration $C_0$, and time grid $t_i$.\n 2. For each temperature $T_j$, generate the concentration data $C(t_i; T_j) = C_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{gen}}(T_j)t_i)$, where $k_{\\text{gen}}(T_j)$ is computed from the generating Arrhenius parameters.\n 3. For each temperature $T_j$, use the generated $(t_i, C_i)$ data to perform a linear fit of $\\ln(C_i)$ versus $t_i$. Calculate the estimated rate constant $k(T_j)$ from the negative of the slope.\n 4. Using the set of estimated rate constants $\\{k(T_j)\\}$, perform a linear fit of $\\ln(k(T_j))$ versus $1/T_j$. Calculate the estimated activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ from the slope of this fit, multiply by $-R$, and convert to $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n 5. Using the set of estimated rate constants $\\{k(T_j)\\}$ and the specified $T_{\\text{ref}}$, calculate the shift factors $a_{T_j} = k(T_j)/k(T_{\\text{ref}})$ for each temperature.\n 6.
