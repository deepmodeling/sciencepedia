We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the half-width of a $0.95$ confidence interval for the inverse-variance weighted mean of the excess heat capacity, $\\Delta C_p$. The excess heat capacity at a given temperature $T$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta C_p(T) = C_p^{\\text{meas}}(\\mathrm{BaZrO_3}; T) - \\left[C_p(\\mathrm{BaO}; T) + C_p(\\mathrm{ZrO_2}; T)\\right]\n$$\nThe values of $C_p$ are given with associated one-standard-deviation uncertainties, which are stated to be statistically independent. For a function $f(X, Y, Z) = X - Y - Z$, where $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are independent random variables with standard deviations $\\sigma_X$, $\\sigma_Y$, and $\\sigma_Z$, the variance of $f$ is given by the sum of the variances of its terms:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta C_p}^2 = \\sigma_{C_p^{\\text{meas}}}^2 + \\sigma_{C_p(\\mathrm{BaO})}^2 + \\sigma_{C_p(\\mathrm{ZrO_2})}^2\n$$\nLet us denote the calculated excess heat capacity at temperature $T_i$ as $y_i$, and its standard deviation as $\\sigma_i$. We will compute these quantities for each of the four temperatures. All heat capacity values and uncertainties are in units of $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nFor $T_1 = 500\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$y_1 = 107.2 - (43.5 + 61.2) = 107.2 - 104.7 = 2.5$\n$\\sigma_1^2 = (0.8)^2 + (0.6)^2 + (0.7)^2 = 0.64 + 0.36 + 0.49 = 1.49$\n\nFor $T_2 = 700\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$y_2 = 115.4 - (47.8 + 66.8) = 115.4 - 114.6 = 0.8$\n$\\sigma_2^2 = (0.9)^2 + (0.7)^2 + (0.7)^2 = 0.81 + 0.49 + 0.49 = 1.79$\n\nFor $T_3 = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$y_3 = 120.2 - (49.6 + 70.1) = 120.2 - 119.7 = 0.5$\n$\\sigma_3^2 = (1.0)^2 + (0.7)^2 + (0.8)^2 = 1.00 + 0.49 + 0.64 = 2.13$\n\nFor $T_4 = 1100\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$y_4 = 123.1 - (50.4 + 72.1) = 123.1 - 122.5 = 0.6$\n$\\sigma_4^2 = (1.1)^2 + (0.8)^2 + (0.8)^2 = 1.21 + 0.64 + 0.64 = 2.49$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the inverse-variance weighted mean, $\\overline{\\Delta C_p}$. While the value of the mean itself is not the final answer, its variance is essential. For a set of $N$ independent measurements $y_i$ with known variances $\\sigma_i^2$, the weights are $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$. The variance of the inverse-variance weighted mean, $\\bar{y}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\bar{y}}^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i^2}}\n$$\nIn our case, $N=4$, and this quantity is the variance of $\\overline{\\Delta C_p}$, denoted $\\sigma_{\\overline{\\Delta C_p}}^2$. The sum of the weights is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_3^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_4^2} = \\frac{1}{1.49} + \\frac{1}{1.79} + \\frac{1}{2.13} + \\frac{1}{2.49}\n$$\nNumerically, this sum is approximately $0.67114 + 0.55866 + 0.46948 + 0.40161 \\approx 2.10089$.\nThe variance of the weighted mean is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\overline{\\Delta C_p}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2.10089...} \\approx 0.475989\n$$\nThe standard deviation (or standard error) of the weighted mean is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\overline{\\Delta C_p}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\overline{\\Delta C_p}}^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.475989} \\approx 0.68992\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nA two-sided $0.95$ confidence interval for the mean is constructed as $\\overline{\\Delta C_p} \\pm H$, where $H$ is the half-width. Since the uncertainties are given as known standard deviations from a Gaussian distribution, we use the normal coverage factor (Z-score). For a $0.95$ confidence level, the cumulative probability is $1 - (1 - 0.95)/2 = 0.975$. The corresponding Z-score is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe half-width $H$ is given by:\n$$\nH = z_{0.975} \\times \\sigma_{\\overline{\\Delta C_p}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nH \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.68992\n$$\n$$\nH \\approx 1.35224\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\nH \\approx 1.35\n$$\nThe half-width of the confidence interval is $1.35\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.35}$$", "id": "2486493"}]}
