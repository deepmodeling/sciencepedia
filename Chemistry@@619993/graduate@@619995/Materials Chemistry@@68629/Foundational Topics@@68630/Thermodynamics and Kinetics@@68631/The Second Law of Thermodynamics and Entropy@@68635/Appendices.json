The objectives are stated with precision.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and devoid of subjectivity.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in statistical thermodynamics that tests fundamental understanding. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins from the Boltzmann postulate for entropy, which relates the entropy $S$ of a macroscopic system to the number of accessible microstates $\\Omega$ corresponding to its macrostate:\n$$S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor the specified ternary alloy, the macrostate is defined by the total number of lattice sites, $N$, and the site fractions $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$. The number of atoms of each species is thus $N_A = x_A N$, $N_B = x_B N$, and $N_C = x_C N$. The assumption of ideal mixing implies that all spatial arrangements of these atoms on the $N$ sites are equally probable. The total number of such arrangements, $\\Omega$, is the number of ways to arrange $N_A$ objects of type $A$, $N_B$ objects of type $B$, and $N_C$ objects of type $C$ on $N$ distinct sites. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$$\\Omega = \\frac{N!}{N_A! N_B! N_C!} = \\frac{N!}{(x_A N)! (x_B N)! (x_C N)!}$$\nThe configurational entropy $S_{\\mathrm{conf}}$ is therefore:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} = k_B \\ln \\left( \\frac{N!}{N_A! N_B! N_C!} \\right)$$\nUsing the property of the logarithm, $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$, we can expand this expression:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} = k_B \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\ln(N_A!) - \\ln(N_B!) - \\ln(N_C!) \\right)$$\nFor a macroscopic crystal, the number of atoms $N$, $N_A$, $N_B$, and $N_C$ are all extremely large, on the order of Avogadro's number. This justifies the use of Stirling's approximation for the logarithm of a factorial, $\\ln(X!) \\approx X \\ln(X) - X$ for large $X$. Applying this to each term:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ln(N!) &\\approx N \\ln(N) - N \\\\\n\\ln(N_A!) &\\approx N_A \\ln(N_A) - N_A \\\\\n\\ln(N_B!) &\\approx N_B \\ln(N_B) - N_B \\\\\n\\ln(N_C!) &\\approx N_C \\ln(N_C) - N_C\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting these approximations into the entropy expression:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ (N \\ln N - N) - \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} (N_i \\ln N_i - N_i) \\right]$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - N - \\sum_i N_i \\ln N_i + \\sum_i N_i \\right]$$\nSince the total number of atoms is $N_A + N_B + N_C = N$, the term $\\sum_i N_i = N$. This leads to a cancellation:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_i N_i \\ln N_i \\right]$$\nNow, substitute the relations $N_i = x_i N$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_i (x_i N) \\ln(x_i N) \\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - \\sum_i (x_i N) (\\ln x_i + \\ln N) \\right]$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - N \\sum_i x_i \\ln x_i - N \\ln N \\sum_i x_i \\right]$$\nThe sum of site fractions is constrained by $x_A + x_B + x_C = 1$, so $\\sum_i x_i = 1$. The expression simplifies further:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - N \\sum_i x_i \\ln x_i - N \\ln N \\right]$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}} \\approx -k_B N \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} x_i \\ln x_i$$\nThe configurational entropy per lattice site, $s_{\\mathrm{conf}} = S_{\\mathrm{conf}}/N$, is then:\n$$\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{conf}}}{k_B} = - \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} x_i \\ln x_i = -(x_A \\ln x_A + x_B \\ln x_B + x_C \\ln x_C)$$\nThis is the required expression for the configurational entropy per site.\n\nNext, we analyze the limiting behavior as $x_C \\to 0^{+}$. The conditions are that $x_A + x_B = 1 - x_C$, and $x_A, x_B$ remain finite and non-negative. As $x_C \\to 0^{+}$, it follows that $x_A + x_B \\to 1$. Let the limiting concentrations of $A$ and $B$ be $x'_A$ and $x'_B$ respectively, such that $x'_A + x'_B = 1$. We must evaluate:\n$$\\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{conf}}}{k_B} = \\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} \\left[ -(x_A \\ln x_A + x_B \\ln x_B + x_C \\ln x_C) \\right]$$\nThe terms involving $x_A$ and $x_B$ are continuous functions of their arguments (for $x_A, x_B > 0$). The only term that requires careful analysis is $x_C \\ln x_C$ as $x_C \\to 0^{+}$. This is an indeterminate form of the type $0 \\cdot (-\\infty)$. We can resolve this limit using L'Hôpital's rule by rewriting the expression as a fraction:\n$$\\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} x_C \\ln x_C = \\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\ln x_C}{1/x_C}$$\nThis is now of the form $-\\infty/\\infty$. Differentiating the numerator and the denominator with respect to $x_C$:\n$$\\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} \\frac{1/x_C}{-1/x_C^2} = \\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} (-x_C) = 0$$\nThus, the contribution to the entropy from the vanishing component $C$ is zero. The limit of the entire expression is:\n$$\\lim_{x_C \\to 0^+} \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{conf}}}{k_B} = -(x'_A \\ln x'_A + x'_B \\ln x'_B + 0) = -(x'_A \\ln x'_A + x'_B \\ln x'_B)$$\nThis resulting expression is precisely the configurational entropy per site for a binary alloy with component fractions $x'_A$ and $x'_B$.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this limit is significant. It demonstrates the self-consistency of the statistical model of ideal mixing. As the concentration of one component tends to zero, the thermodynamic properties of the ternary system must smoothly converge to those of the corresponding binary system. The fact that $\\lim_{x\\to 0} x \\ln x = 0$ is crucial; it ensures that an infinitesimal amount of an impurity contributes an infinitesimal amount to the configurational entropy. If this limit were non-zero, it would imply a physically absurd discontinuous jump in entropy upon adding a vanishing trace of a third element to a binary alloy. This mathematical behavior guarantees the continuity of entropy as a function of composition across the entire composition space, which is expected for a well-behaved thermodynamic potential. This is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, which describes entropy as a continuous state function. The result confirms that our microscopic model correctly captures the macroscopic thermodynamic behavior at the boundaries of its defined domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-(x_A \\ln(x_A) + x_B \\ln(x_B) + x_C \\ln(x_C))}$$", "id": "2530067"}, {"introduction": "The second law of thermodynamics provides the ultimate criterion for spontaneity: any spontaneous process must increase the total entropy of the universe ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{univ}} > 0$).

The critical temperature $T_c$ marks the point where it becomes zero.\n$$\\frac{k_B T_c}{2} - \\frac{z C_2}{8} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{k_B T_c}{2} = \\frac{z}{8}(\\epsilon_{AA} + \\epsilon_{BB} - 2\\epsilon_{AB})$$\nSolving for $T_c$:\n$$T_c = \\frac{z}{4k_B}(\\epsilon_{AA} + \\epsilon_{BB} - 2\\epsilon_{AB})$$\nFor ordering to be energetically favorable, the quantity $\\epsilon_{AA} + \\epsilon_{BB} - 2\\epsilon_{AB}$ must be positive, which implies that forming two $A\\text{–}B$ bonds is energetically preferred over forming one $A\\text{–}A$ and one $B\\text{–}B$ bond. Thus, $T_c$ will be a positive temperature.\n\nFinally, we analyze the entropy loss associated with ordering. The change in configurational entropy is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(\\eta) = S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(\\eta) - S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(0)$.\nAt $\\eta=0$, the entropy is $S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(0) = -\\frac{N k_B}{2} ( -2\\ln 2 ) = N k_B \\ln 2$, which is the entropy of a completely random equiatomic mixture.\nUsing the expansion for $g(\\eta)$, we find the expansion for $S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(\\eta)$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(\\eta) = -\\frac{N k_B}{2} [ (\\eta^2 + \\frac{1}{6}\\eta^4 + \\dots) - 2\\ln 2 ] = N k_B \\ln 2 - \\frac{N k_B}{2}\\eta^2 - \\frac{N k_B}{12}\\eta^4 - \\dots$$\nThe entropy difference is therefore:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{conf}}(\\eta) = (N k_B \\ln 2 - \\frac{N k_B}{2}\\eta^2 - \\dots) - N k_B \\ln 2 = -\\frac{N k_B}{2}\\eta^2 - O(\\eta^4)$$\nThe leading nonzero term is $-\\frac{N k_B}{2}\\eta^2$. The negative sign signifies that any degree of ordering ($\\eta \\neq 0$) reduces the number of available microstates compared to the fully disordered state, thereby decreasing the configurational entropy. Ordering imposes constraints on the atomic arrangement, moving the system from a state of maximum randomness towards a more structured configuration. This loss of configurational disorder is fundamental to any ordering process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{z}{4k_{B}}(\\epsilon_{AA} + \\epsilon_{BB} - 2\\epsilon_{AB})}$$", "id": "2530022"}]}
