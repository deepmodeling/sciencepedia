This is the **common tangent construction**.\nTo demonstrate this rigorously, substituting the expressions for chemical potentials into the equilibrium conditions gives:\n$$\ng(x_\\alpha) - x_\\alpha \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha} = g(x_\\beta) - x_\\beta \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\beta}\n$$\n$$\ng(x_\\alpha) + (1-x_\\alpha) \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha} = g(x_\\beta) + (1-x_\\beta) \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\beta}\n$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\beta}\n$$\nThis confirms that the slopes of the $g(x)$ curve at the two equilibrium compositions must be equal. Substituting this equality back into the first equation gives:\n$$\ng(x_\\alpha) - x_\\alpha \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha} = g(x_\\beta) - x_\\beta \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha}\n$$\n$$\ng(x_\\beta) - g(x_\\alpha) = (x_\\beta - x_\\alpha) \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha} \\implies \\frac{g(x_\\beta) - g(x_\\alpha)}{x_\\beta - x_\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x_\\alpha}\n$$\nThis equation states that the slope of the line connecting the points $(x_\\alpha, g(x_\\alpha))$ and $(x_\\beta, g(x_\\beta))$ is equal to the slope of the tangent at $x_\\alpha$, which is also the slope of the tangent at $x_\\beta$. This is precisely the condition for a common tangent line.\n\nIn summary, on a graph of $g(x, T)$ versus $x$ at a fixed temperature below the critical point:\n-   The **binodal** compositions are the two points of tangency of a common tangent line to the $g(x)$ curve. A system with an overall composition between these points will achieve its lowest Gibbs free energy by separating into two phases with these binodal compositions.\n-   The **spinodal** compositions are the two inflection points of the $g(x)$ curve, where $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}=0$.\n\nThe region between the binodal and spinodal curves is metastable. A homogeneous phase in this region is stable against infinitesimal fluctuations ($\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} > 0$) but unstable against sufficiently large fluctuations, leading to phase separation via nucleation and growth. The region inside the spinodal curve is unstable ($\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} < 0$), and a homogeneous phase will spontaneously decompose without an energy barrier.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T_s(x) = \\frac{2\\Omega x(1-x)}{R}}\n$$", "id": "2488781"}]}
