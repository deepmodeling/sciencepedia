Do not attach units to your final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the linear density $LD_{[100]}$ for a simple cubic (SC) crystal lattice with a single-atom basis. The analysis must be based on fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we define the simple cubic Bravais lattice. The lattice points are given by the set of vectors $\\vec{R}$ such that $\\vec{R} = n_1 \\vec{a}_1 + n_2 \\vec{a}_2 + n_3 \\vec{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers. For a simple cubic lattice with lattice parameter $a$, the primitive lattice vectors can be chosen as a set of orthogonal vectors of length $a$:\n$$ \\vec{a}_1 = a \\hat{x} $$\n$$ \\vec{a}_2 = a \\hat{y} $$\n$$ \\vec{a}_3 = a \\hat{z} $$\nThe problem states there is a single-atom basis at each lattice point. This means the position of every atom in the crystal coincides with a lattice point $\\vec{R}$.\n\nNext, we identify the crystallographic direction $[100]$. This direction is defined by the vector $\\vec{v} = 1 \\cdot \\vec{a}_1 + 0 \\cdot \\vec{a}_2 + 0 \\cdot \\vec{a}_3 = \\vec{a}_1 = a\\hat{x}$. This vector points along the positive x-axis, which is a cube edge of the conventional unit cell.\n\nThe linear density $LD_{[100]}$ is defined as the number of atoms per unit length along a line parallel to the $[100]$ direction. Let us consider the line passing through the origin, which is the x-axis. The atomic centers located on this line correspond to lattice points where $n_2=0$ and $n_3=0$. The positions of these atoms are given by $\\vec{R} = n_1 a \\hat{x}$ for all integers $n_1$. Thus, we have a one-dimensional chain of atoms located at positions $x = \\dots, -2a, -a, 0, a, 2a, \\dots$.\n\nTo calculate the linear density, we follow the instruction to select a minimal translational repeat segment along the $[100]$ direction. The crystal is periodic along this direction, and the shortest translational vector that maps the crystal onto itself is $\\vec{T} = \\vec{a}_1 = a\\hat{x}$. The length of this minimal repeat vector is the repeat length, $L = |\\vec{a}_1| = a$.\n\nWe now need to find the number of distinct atomic centers, $N$, associated with this repeat segment of length $L=a$. Let us consider the segment along the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=a$. The atomic centers on this segment are at its endpoints: one at $x=0$ and another at $x=a$. To correctly account for the number of atoms per periodic repeat unit, we must avoid double counting. The standard convention in crystallography is to count any atom at the origin of the unit cell (or, in this 1D case, the start of the segment) as belonging to that cell, while any atoms on the other boundaries are considered part of adjacent cells. The atom at $x=a$ is equivalent by translation to the atom at $x=0$ for the next repeat segment. Therefore, the number of distinct atomic centers per repeat segment is $N=1$.\n\nAlternatively, one may consider that an atom at an endpoint of a 1D segment is shared by the two adjacent segments. Each of the two atoms at the ends of the segment from $x=0$ to $x=a$ would then contribute a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ to the segment. The total number of atoms within the segment is then $N = (\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$. Both counting methods yield the same result: there is effectively $1$ atom per repeat length $a$.\n\nFinally, the linear density $LD_{[100]}$ is calculated as the ratio of the number of atoms per repeat segment to the length of that segment:\n$$ LD_{[100]} = \\frac{N}{L} $$\nSubstituting the values we found, $N=1$ and $L=a$:\n$$ LD_{[100]} = \\frac{1}{a} $$\nThis is the closed-form symbolic function of $a$ that represents the linear density along the $[100]$ direction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{a}}$$", "id": "2495980"}, {"introduction": "Why do different crystal structures with the same lattice parameter exhibit different properties?

The planar density $PD_{(hkl)}$ on a plane $(hkl)$ is defined as the number of lattice points per unit area of that plane.\n\nWe must first identify the arrangement of lattice points on a $(100)$ plane. A $(100)$ plane is, by definition, any plane parallel to the $y$ and $z$ axes in a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the cubic cell. For convenience, we will analyze the plane that intersects the $x$-axis at $x=0$, which is the $yz$-plane. To calculate the density, we will consider a fundamental repeating region on this plane. For all three cubic lattices, a square with side length $a$ and area $A=a^{2}$, defined by the vectors $a\\hat{y}$ and $a\\hat{z}$, serves as a valid and convenient repeating unit area. We will count the number of lattice points, $N_{(100)}$, associated with this area.\n\nA lattice point located at a corner of this square region is shared by four adjacent regions in the plane, so it contributes $\\frac{1}{4}$ to the count for one region. A point on an edge (but not a corner) is shared by two regions and contributes $\\frac{1}{2}$. A point in the interior of the region contributes its entirety, $1$.\n\n1.  **Simple Cubic (SC) Lattice**\n    The lattice points of the SC structure are given by vectors $\\vec{R} = n_1 a\\hat{x} + n_2 a\\hat{y} + n_3 a\\hat{z}$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers.\n    For points to lie on the plane $x=0$, we must have $n_1=0$. The points on this plane are therefore at positions $n_2 a\\hat{y} + n_3 a\\hat{z}$. These points form a two-dimensional square lattice with a lattice constant of $a$.\n    Our chosen square region with area $A = a^{2}$ has four lattice points at its corners (e.g., at $(0,0,0)$, $(0,a,0)$, $(0,0,a)$, $(0,a,a)$). There are no other lattice points on its edges or in its interior.\n    The number of lattice points within this region is $N_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{SC}} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n    The planar density is therefore:\n    $$PD_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\frac{N_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{SC}}}{A} = \\frac{1}{a^{2}}$$\n\n2.  **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\n    The BCC lattice consists of the SC lattice points plus an additional set of points generated by a centering translation of $\\vec{t} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{x} + \\hat{y} + \\hat{z})$ applied to each SC point.\n    A general lattice point is either of the form $n_1 a\\hat{x} + n_2 a\\hat{y} + n_3 a\\hat{z}$ or $(n_1+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{x} + (n_2+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{y} + (n_3+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{z}$.\n    To find points on the plane $x=0$, we examine the $x$-coordinate of these general points.\n    - For the first type (corner points), $n_1 a = 0$ implies $n_1=0$. This gives the same square lattice on the $x=0$ plane as in the SC case.\n    - For the second type (body-centered points), $(n_1+\\frac{1}{2})a = 0$ implies $n_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which is not an integer. Therefore, no body-centered points lie on the plane $x=0$.\n    The arrangement of lattice points on the $(100)$ plane at $x=0$ is identical to that of the SC lattice.\n    The number of lattice points within the $a \\times a$ square region is $N_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{BCC}} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n    The planar density is:\n    $$PD_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{BCC}} = \\frac{N_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{BCC}}}{A} = \\frac{1}{a^{2}}$$\n\n3.  **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice**\n    The FCC lattice consists of the SC lattice points plus points generated by centering translations corresponding to the centers of the faces: $\\vec{t}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{y}+\\hat{z})$, $\\vec{t}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{z}+\\hat{x})$, and $\\vec{t}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{y})$.\n    We again consider the lattice points on the plane $x=0$.\n    - The SC points at $x=0$ form the familiar square lattice, giving four corner points to our reference area.\n    - We now check the centered points. A general centered point is $\\vec{R}_{SC} + \\vec{t}_i$ for some SC point $\\vec{R}_{SC}$ and some centering vector $\\vec{t}_i$. To lie on the $x=0$ plane, the $x$-component of the resulting vector must be zero. Let's start from an SC point on the plane, say $\\vec{R}_{SC,0} = n_2 a \\hat{y} + n_3 a \\hat{z}$.\n    - Adding $\\vec{t}_1$: The new point is $n_2 a \\hat{y} + n_3 a \\hat{z} + \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{y}+\\hat{z}) = (n_2+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{y} + (n_3+\\frac{1}{2})a\\hat{z}$. This point has a zero $x$-component and thus lies on the $x=0$ plane. These points are located at the center of each square formed by the SC corner points.\n    - Adding $\\vec{t}_2$ or $\\vec{t}_3$: Both these vectors have a non-zero $x$-component of $\\frac{a}{2}$. Adding them to an SC point on the $x=0$ plane will produce a point with $x=\\frac{a}{2}$, which is not on the plane under consideration.\n    Therefore, the $(100)$ plane in an FCC lattice contains the corner points and an additional point at the center of each $a \\times a$ square.\n    For our $a \\times a$ square region, the number of lattice points is the sum of contributions from the corners and the interior point:\n    $N_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{FCC}} = (4 \\times \\frac{1}{4}) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    The planar density is:\n    $$PD_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{FCC}} = \\frac{N_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{FCC}}}{A} = \\frac{2}{a^{2}}$$\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe planar densities for the $(100)$ plane are $PD_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{SC}} = PD_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{BCC}} = \\frac{1}{a^2}$ and $PD_{(100)}^{\\mathrm{FCC}} = \\frac{2}{a^2}$. The density for FCC is twice that of SC and BCC. This difference is a direct consequence of the nature of the centering translations.\n\nA centering translation adds points to a Bravais lattice. For these new points to increase the planar density of a specific plane, the centering translation vector, when added to a point already on that plane, must produce a new point that also lies on that same plane.\n\n-   For BCC, the centering vector is $\\vec{t}_{BCC} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{x} + \\hat{y} + \\hat{z})$. This vector has a component $\\frac{a}{2}\\hat{x}$ which is perpendicular to the $(100)$ planes. It therefore translates points *off* the original $(100)$ planes, creating a new, identical set of planes interleaved between them (e.g., at $x=a/2$, $x=3a/2$, etc.). It does not add any points *to* the existing $(100)$ planes defined by the corner atoms.\n\n-   For FCC, there are three centering vectors. Two of them, $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{z}+\\hat{x})$ and $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{y})$, have components perpendicular to the $(100)$ plane and behave similarly to the BCC case. However, the third vector, $\\vec{t} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{y}+\\hat{z})$, is entirely parallel to the $(100)$ plane (i.e., its component perpendicular to the plane is zero). This translation generates new lattice points that lie *within* the original $(100)$ planes, effectively doubling the number of points per unit area on these planes.\n\nThe conclusion is inescapable: the higher planar density of the FCC $(100)$ plane is due to the existence of a centering translation vector that lies completely within that plane.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{a^{2}} & \\frac{1}{a^{2}} & \\frac{2}{a^{2}} \\end{bmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2495987"}, {"introduction": "In real materials, properties like slip, surface energy, and reactivity are highly dependent on crystallographic orientation—a phenomenon known as anisotropy.

We will derive each one from the provided definitions.\n\n1.  **Linear Density along $[110]$, $LD_{[110]}$**\n    The direction $[110]$ corresponds to a face diagonal of the cubic cell. The definition requires we use the \"shortest translation segment along that direction\". In an FCC lattice, the shortest translation vector connecting two lattice points along the $[110]$ direction is the vector from a corner atom, e.g., at $(0,0,0)$, to an adjacent face-center atom, e.g., at $(a/2, a/2, 0)$.\n    The length of this segment, $L_{[110]}$, is:\n    $$L_{[110]} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n    This segment connects two atomic centers, one at its start and one at its end.

The atoms form a hexagonal arrangement. The smallest two-dimensional repeat region (the primitive cell) is a rhombus. The vertices of this rhombus are atom centers. For example, we can choose lattice points $(a/2,a/2,0)$, $(a/2,0,a/2)$, $(0,a/2,a/2)$ and $(0,0,a)$. The side length of the rhombus is the nearest-neighbor distance in the FCC lattice, which is $d = a/\\sqrt{2}$. The internal angles of the rhombus are $60^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$.\n    The area of this rhombus, $A_{(111)}$, is:\n    $$A_{(111)} = d^2 \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{a^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\n    Since this is a primitive repeat region, it contains exactly one lattice point (atom) by definition. We can verify this with the counting rules: the rhombus has $4$ vertices, and each vertex is shared by $4$ adjacent rhombi in a planar tiling.\n    The number of atoms, $N_{(111)}$, is:\n    $$N_{(111)} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$$\n    The planar density is:\n    $$PD_{(111)} = \\frac{N_{(111)}}{A_{(111)}} = \\frac{1}{a^2\\sqrt{3}/4} = \\frac{4}{a^2\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation and Units**\nTo evaluate these expressions for $a = 4.00$ $\\text{\\AA}$:\n- For $LD_{[110]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a}$, one would substitute $a=4.00$ to get $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4.00}$.
