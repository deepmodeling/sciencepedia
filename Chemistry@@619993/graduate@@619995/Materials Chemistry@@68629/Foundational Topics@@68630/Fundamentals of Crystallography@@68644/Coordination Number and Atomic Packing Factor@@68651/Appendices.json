It presents a standard problem in two-dimensional crystallography that can be solved rigorously from first principles as requested. The givens and definitions are sufficient and unambiguous for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the coordination number (CN) and the two-dimensional atomic packing factor (APF), denoted as $\\eta$, for two distinct Bravais lattices: square and hexagonal (or triangular). The APF is defined as the ratio of the area occupied by disks within a primitive unit cell to the total area of that primitive unit cell.\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{A_{\\text{disks}}}{A_{\\text{cell}}}\n$$\nBy definition, a primitive unit cell contains exactly one lattice point. When identical disks of radius $r$ are centered on each lattice point, the total area of disk material within a primitive cell is always equal to the area of a single disk, which is $\\pi r^{2}$. The coordination number is the count of nearest-neighboring lattice points. The problem specifies that the disks are arranged such that nearest neighbors are in contact, meaning the distance between the centers of nearest-neighbor disks is $2r$.\n\n**Part 1: The Square Lattice**\n\nFor a two-dimensional square lattice, we can define the primitive lattice vectors as:\n$$\n\\vec{a}_{1} = a\\hat{x} \\\\\n\\vec{a}_{2} = a\\hat{y}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the lattice parameter.

It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and a standard problem in solid-state chemistry and physics. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nWe establish a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at one corner of the conventional cubic cell, and its axes aligned with the cube edges. The conventional cell is a cube of edge length $a$, occupying the region defined by $0 \\le x \\le a$, $0 \\le y \\le a$, and $0 \\le z \\le a$.\n\nIn a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, identical spheres of radius $r$ are centered at the $8$ corners and the $6$ face centers of the conventional cell.\nThe coordinates of the corner atom centers are of the form $(ia, ja, ka)$ where $i, j, k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe coordinates of the face-centered atom centers are $(a/2, a/2, 0)$, $(a/2, 0, a/2)$, $(0, a/2, a/2)$, and their permutations.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the lattice parameter $a$ and the atomic radius $r$. The fcc structure is a close-packed arrangement. This implies that the atoms are in contact along specific directions. In the fcc lattice, the atoms along the face diagonals are tangent. Let us consider the face on the $xy$-plane ($z=0$). There are atoms centered at the corner $(0, 0, 0)$ and at the face center $(a/2, a/2, 0)$. These are nearest-neighbor atoms and are therefore in contact in the hard-sphere model.\n\nThe distance $d$ between the centers of these two atoms is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:\n$$d = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2} - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2} - 0\\right)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nSince these two spheres are tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii, which is $r + r = 2r$.\nEquating the geometric distance to the sum of radii gives the constraint:\n$$2r = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nFrom this, we derive the relationship between $a$ and $r$:\n$$a = 2\\sqrt{2}r \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we consider the octahedral interstitial site located at the center of the conventional cubic cell. The coordinates of this site are $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$. We must identify the host spheres that are nearest to this site. By symmetry, the nearest host atoms are the $6$ atoms located at the centers of the faces of the cube. Their coordinates are:\n$(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, a)$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, a, \\frac{a}{2})$, $(0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$, and $(a, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$.\n\nLet us compute the distance from the octahedral site center $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$ to the center of one of these nearest host atoms, for instance, the one on the $z=0$ face at $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$.

The tangency condition implies that the distance between the center of the interstitial sphere and the center of a neighboring host sphere is the sum of their radii, $r_{\\text{oct}} + r$.\nTherefore, we have the relation:\n$$d_{\\text{oct-host}} = r_{\\text{oct}} + r$$\nSubstituting the calculated distance $d_{\\text{oct-host}} = a/2$:\n$$\\frac{a}{2} = r_{\\text{oct}} + r \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n$$(1): \\quad a = 2\\sqrt{2}r$$\n$$(2): \\quad \\frac{a}{2} = r_{\\text{oct}} + r$$\nOur goal is to find the ratio $r_{\\text{oct}}/r$.

Thus, we define:\n$$\nI = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if Voronoi index is } \\langle 0, 0, 12, 0 \\rangle \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis classification partitions the sites into two distinct populations for statistical comparison. Note that while the coordination number is given by $\\mathrm{CN} = n_{3} + n_{4} + n_{5} + n_{6}$, the classification relies strictly on the full index, not merely that $\\mathrm{CN}=12$.\n\nSecond, after processing all $N$ sites in a dataset to generate a set of pairs $\\{ (I_i, \\phi_i) \\}_{i=1}^N$, five aggregate statistical quantities are calculated to characterize the dataset as a whole.\n\n$1$. The fraction of strictly icosahedral sites, $f$, is the arithmetic mean of the indicator variable:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i\n$$\n\n$2$. The sites are partitioned using the indicator $I$. The mean local packing fraction for the strictly icosahedral sites ($I=1$), denoted $mI$, and the mean for the non-icosahedral sites ($I=0$), denoted $mN$, are computed. In accordance with the problem statement, if either population is empty, its corresponding mean is defined to be $0$.\n\n$3$. The difference in mean packing fractions, $d = mI - mN$, is calculated. This value provides a direct measure of the enhancement, if any, in packing density associated with icosahedral coordination. A positive $d$ supports the hypothesis that icosahedral order correlates with denser packing.\n\n$4$. The Pearson correlation coefficient, $\\rho(I, \\phi)$, between the indicator vector $I$ and the packing fraction vector $\\phi$ is computed using the standard formula:\n$$\n\\rho(I,\\phi) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (I_{i}-\\overline{I}) (\\phi_{i}-\\overline{\\phi})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (I_{i}-\\overline{I})^{2}} \\, \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\phi_{i}-\\overline{\\phi})^{2}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\overline{I}$ and $\\overline{\\phi}$ are the sample means of $I$ and $\\phi$, respectively. This coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between the binary property of being icosahedral and the continuous property of local packing density. As stipulated, if the variance of either vector is zero (i.e., all sites are icosahedral or all are non-icosahedral), the correlation $\\rho(I, \\phi)$ is defined to be $0$.\n\nThis complete procedure is applied to each of the four datasets provided in the test suite to generate the final results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of analyzing local atomic environments in a metallic glass.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Foundational definitions and facts\n    RADII = {\n        \"Zr\": 1.60,\n        \"Cu\": 1.28,\n        \"Ni\": 1.25,\n        \"Al\": 1.43,\n    }\n    ATOMIC_VOLUMES = {\n        species: (4 / 3) * math.pi * (radius**3)\n        for species, radius in RADII.items()\n    }\n    ICOSAHEDRAL_INDEX = (0, 0, 12, 0)\n\n    # Test suite\n    datasets = {\n        \"A\": [\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 24.8),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 23.5),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 2, 8, 2), 14.7),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 1, 10, 1), 13.2),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 12.0),\n            (\"Ni\", (1, 0, 10, 1), 13.5),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 16.8),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 3, 6, 3), 16.5),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 25.2),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 4, 4, 4), 26.0),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 13.8),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 12.5),\n        ],\n        \"B\": [\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 24.0),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 23.8),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 1, 10, 1), 25.0),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 14.0),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 2, 8, 2), 14.5),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 12.4),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 12.8),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 17.5),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 3, 6, 3), 16.0),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 13.9),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 24.5),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 1, 10, 1), 13.0),\n        ],\n        \"C\": [\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 2, 8, 2), 25.5),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 3, 6, 3), 26.2),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 1, 10, 1), 15.2),\n            (\"Ni\", (1, 0, 10, 1), 13.7),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 4, 4, 4), 18.0),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 2, 8, 2), 14.2),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 3, 6, 3), 12.9),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 1, 10, 1), 17.0),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 1, 10, 1), 24.8),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 4, 4, 4), 15.5),\n        ],\n        \"D\": [\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 24.2),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 23.9),\n            (\"Cu\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 13.6),\n            (\"Ni\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 12.3),\n            (\"Al\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 16.6),\n            (\"Zr\", (0, 0, 12, 0), 24.7),\n        ],\n    }\n\n    def analyze_dataset(dataset):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the five required statistical quantities for a single dataset.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not dataset:\n            return [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n        # Stage 1: Per-site analysis\n        indicators = []\n        packing_fractions = []\n        \n        for site in dataset:\n            species, voronoi_index, voronoi_volume = site\n            \n            # Classify site\n            is_icosahedral = 1 if voronoi_index == ICOSAHEDRAL_INDEX else 0\n            indicators.append(is_icosahedral)\n            \n            # Compute local packing fraction\n            atomic_volume = ATOMIC_VOLUMES[species]\n            phi = atomic_volume / voronoi_volume\n            packing_fractions.append(phi)\n            \n        indicators = np.array(indicators)\n        packing_fractions = np.array(packing_fractions)\n\n        # Stage 2: Dataset-level statistical analysis\n        \n        # 1.
