The thermodynamic criterion for stability is that at constant pressure $p$ and temperature $T$, the stable phase is the one with the minimum molar Gibbs free energy, $G$. At the transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, the two phases are in equilibrium, which is defined by the condition that their molar Gibbs free energies are equal:\n$$G_{\\alpha}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}}, p) = G_{\\beta}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}}, p)$$\nThis implies that the change in molar Gibbs free energy for the transformation $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta$ is zero at the transition temperature:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}}, p) = G_{\\beta}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}}, p) - G_{\\alpha}(T_{\\mathrm{trans}}, p) = 0$$\nThe molar Gibbs free energy $G$ is defined by the fundamental relation $G = H - TS$, where $H$ is the molar enthalpy and $S$ is the molar entropy.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We will proceed in two parts: first, a qualitative analysis of the carbon allotropes, and second, a quantitative calculation of the graphite-diamond transition pressure.\n\nPart 1: Comparison of Carbon Allotropes\n\nThe distinct properties of graphite, diamond, and lonsdaleite arise from differences in the hybridization of carbon's atomic orbitals and the resulting three-dimensional bonding network, or topology.\n\nGraphite: In graphite, each carbon atom is $sp^2$ hybridized. It forms three strong covalent sigma ($\\sigma$) bonds with three neighboring atoms in a trigonal planar geometry, creating a network of fused hexagonal rings in a two-dimensional sheet. The bond angle is approximately $120^\\circ$. The remaining unhybridized $p_z$ orbital on each carbon atom is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the sheet. These $p_z$ orbitals overlap laterally with those of adjacent atoms to form a delocalized $\\pi$-electron system extending across the entire sheet. This $\\pi$ system is responsible for graphite's electrical conductivity and its characteristic luster. The sheets themselves are stacked and held together by weak van der Waals forces, with a relatively large interlayer spacing. This weak interlayer bonding allows the sheets to slide past one another easily, which explains graphite's use as a lubricant and its comparatively low density ($\\rho_{\\mathrm{graphite}} = 2.267 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). Due to the stability conferred by the delocalized $\\pi$-electron system, graphite is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon at ambient pressure ($P \\approx 0$) and temperature.\n\nDiamond: In diamond, each carbon atom is $sp^3$ hybridized. It forms four identical, strong $\\sigma$ bonds directed towards the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, with a bond angle of $109.5^\\circ$. This tetrahedral coordination repeats to form an exceptionally strong, rigid, and isotropic three-dimensional covalent network. The crystal structure of common diamond is cubic, corresponding to an 'ABC' stacking sequence of puckered six-membered carbon rings, all of which are in the low-energy 'chair' conformation. The absence of delocalized electrons makes diamond an excellent electrical insulator. The dense, tightly-packed network of strong covalent bonds results in its extreme hardness and high density ($\\rho_{\\mathrm{diamond}} = 3.51 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). Diamond is less stable than graphite at ambient pressure but becomes the stable phase at very high pressures.\n\nLonsdaleite: Also known as hexagonal diamond, lonsdaleite is structurally similar to diamond in that every carbon atom is $sp^3$ hybridized and tetrahedrally coordinated. The distinction lies in the crystal stacking sequence. Whereas cubic diamond has an 'ABC' stacking, lonsdaleite has an 'AB' hexagonal stacking sequence. This structural difference means that the six-membered rings in the lonsdaleite lattice exist in the higher-energy 'boat' and 'twist-boat' conformations, in addition to 'chair' conformations. Because the boat conformation is sterically strained and thus energetically less favorable than the chair conformation, lonsdaleite is thermodynamically less stable than cubic diamond under all known conditions. It is a metastable phase sometimes formed from graphite during high-pressure, high-stress events such as meteorite impacts.\n\nIn summary, at ambient pressure, the order of thermodynamic stability is graphite > diamond > lonsdaleite.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Transition Pressure\n\nThe thermodynamic potential that determines phase stability at constant pressure ($P$) and temperature ($T$) is the Gibbs free energy, $G$. A phase transition between two phases, graphite ($g$) and diamond ($d$), occurs when their molar Gibbs free energies are equal: $\\Delta G_{d-g} = G_d - G_g = 0$. Diamond becomes the thermodynamically stable phase when $G_d < G_g$, or $\\Delta G_{d-g} < 0$.\n\nThe differential of the Gibbs free energy is $dG = VdP - SdT$. To find how $\\Delta G_{d-g}$ changes with pressure at a constant temperature, we integrate this expression.\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for the graphite-to-diamond transformation at a pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ is related to its value at a reference pressure $P_0$ (we take $P_0=0$) by:\n$$ \\Delta G_{d-g}(P, T) = \\Delta G_{d-g}(0, T) + \\int_{0}^{P} \\Delta V(P') dP' $$\nwhere $\\Delta V = V_d - V_g$ is the change in molar volume for the transformation. The problem states to treat the molar volumes as independent of pressure, so $\\Delta V$ is a constant. The integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta G_{d-g}(P, T) = \\Delta G_{d-g}(0, T) + \\Delta V \\cdot P $$\nAt the transition pressure, $P_{trans}$, we have $\\Delta G_{d-g}(P_{trans}, T) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = \\Delta G_{d-g}(0, T) + \\Delta V \\cdot P_{trans} $$\nSolving for $P_{trans}$ gives:\n$$ P_{trans} = - \\frac{\\Delta G_{d-g}(0, T)}{\\Delta V} $$\nThe problem specifies the limit $T \\to 0 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. In this limit, the Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S$ approaches the enthalpy change $\\Delta H$, as the entropy term $T\\Delta S$ vanishes.\nTherefore, at $T \\to 0 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, the transition pressure is given by:\n$$ P_{trans} = - \\frac{\\Delta H_{d-g}(0)}{\\Delta V} $$\nWe are given $\\Delta H_{d-g}(0) = +1.90 \\ \\mathrm{kJ} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The positive sign indicates that at zero pressure, diamond is less stable (has higher enthalpy) than graphite, as expected.\n\nNext, we must calculate the molar volume change, $\\Delta V$. The molar volume $V_m$ is related to the molar mass $M$ and density $\\rho$ by $V_m = \\frac{M}{\\rho}$.\n$$ \\Delta V = V_d - V_g = \\frac{M}{\\rho_d} - \\frac{M}{\\rho_g} = M \\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho_d} - \\frac{1}{\\rho_g} \\right) $$\nUsing the provided data: $M = 12.011 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $\\rho_d = 3.51 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, and $\\rho_g = 2.267 \\ \\mathrm{g} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n$$ \\Delta V = 12.011 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ mol^{-1}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3.51 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ cm^{-3}}} - \\frac{1}{2.267 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ cm^{-3}}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta V \\approx 12.011 \\ \\left( 0.28490 - 0.44107 \\right) \\ \\mathrm{cm^3 \\ mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Delta V \\approx 12.011 \\ (-0.15617) \\ \\mathrm{cm^3 \\ mol^{-1}} \\approx -1.8757 \\ \\mathrm{cm^3 \\ mol^{-1}} $$\nThe negative sign of $\\Delta V$ confirms that diamond is denser than graphite.\n\nNow, we calculate the transition pressure.
