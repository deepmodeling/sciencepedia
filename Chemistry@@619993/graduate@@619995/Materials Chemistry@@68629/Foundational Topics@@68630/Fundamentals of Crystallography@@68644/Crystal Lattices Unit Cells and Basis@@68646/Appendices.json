We will use these rules to express the lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$ in this Cartesian frame.\n\nFirst, the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is defined to be aligned with the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$-axis. Its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{a}| = a$. Thus, its components are unequivocally determined:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} = a \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = (a, 0, 0)\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $a=4.2$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} = (4.2, 0, 0)\\,\\text{\\AA}\n$$\n\nSecond, the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is aligned with the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$-axis. Its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{b}| = b$. Its components are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b} = b \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = (0, b, 0)\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $b=6.0$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b} = (0, 6.0, 0)\\,\\text{\\AA}\n$$\nThis arrangement is consistent with the specified inter-axial angle $\\gamma=90^\\circ$. The angle $\\gamma$ is between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, and the dot product confirms this: $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = (a, 0, 0) \\cdot (0, b, 0) = 0$, which corresponds to an angle of $90^\\circ$.\n\nThird, the vector $\\mathbf{c}$ has magnitude $|\\mathbf{c}|=c$ and is constrained to lie in the $x$-$z$ plane. Its component form is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{c} = (c_x, 0, c_z)\n$$\nThe magnitude condition gives the relation:\n$$\nc_x^2 + c_y^2 + c_z^2 = c_x^2 + 0^2 + c_z^2 = c_x^2 + c_z^2 = c^2\n$$\nThe angle $\\beta$ is between vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$. The dot product provides a means to find the component $c_x$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{c}| \\cos(\\beta) = ac \\cos(\\beta)\n$$\nExpressing the dot product in terms of components:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = (a, 0, 0) \\cdot (c_x, 0, c_z) = ac_x\n$$\nBy equating these two expressions, we solve for $c_x$:\n$$\nac_x = ac \\cos(\\beta) \\implies c_x = c \\cos(\\beta)\n$$\nWe substitute this into the magnitude relation to find $c_z$:\n$$\n(c \\cos(\\beta))^2 + c_z^2 = c^2 \\implies c_z^2 = c^2 - c^2 \\cos^2(\\beta) = c^2 (1 - \\cos^2(\\beta)) = c^2 \\sin^2(\\beta)\n$$\nThis yields $c_z = \\pm c \\sin(\\beta)$. Since $\\beta = 104^\\circ$, it lies in the interval $(0, 180^\\circ)$, so $\\sin(\\beta)$ is strictly positive. The sign of $c_z$ is determined by the condition that the basis $(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c})$ must be right-handed, which is stated as $(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}) \\cdot \\mathbf{c} > 0$. We compute the scalar triple product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = (a \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\times (b \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = ab (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = ab \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\n$$\n(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}) \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = (ab \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\cdot (c_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + c_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = ab c_z\n$$\nThe condition $ab c_z > 0$, coupled with the fact that $a$ and $b$ are positive lengths, forces $c_z$ to be positive. Thus, we select the positive root:\n$$\nc_z = c \\sin(\\beta)\n$$\nThis construction also satisfies $\\alpha=90^\\circ$, which is the angle between $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$, since their dot product is $\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{c} = (0,b,0) \\cdot (c_x, 0, c_z) = 0$.\n\nThe unit cell volume $V$ is the magnitude of the scalar triple product.

Rotational Symmetry and Crystal System**\nA Bravais lattice must be invariant under rotations that belong to its point group. We investigate the rotational symmetries implied by the metric. Consider a rotation by an angle $\\phi$ about the $\\mathbf{a}_3$-axis (the $z$-axis). A general lattice point, described relative to the conventional cell origin, is $\\mathbf{R} = n_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\\mathbf{a}_3$. A rotation maps this point to $\\mathbf{R}'$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}' = (n_1 a \\cos\\phi - n_2 a \\sin\\phi)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (n_1 a \\sin\\phi + n_2 a \\cos\\phi)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 c \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nFor $\\mathbf{R}'$ to be another lattice point, it must be expressible as $\\mathbf{R}' = n'_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n'_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n'_3\\mathbf{a}_3$ for some integers $n'_1, n'_2, n'_3$. This requires:\n$$\nn'_1 = n_1 \\cos\\phi - n_2 \\sin\\phi\n$$\n$$\nn'_2 = n_1 \\sin\\phi + n_2 \\cos\\phi\n$$\n$$\nn'_3 = n_3\n$$\nThese must hold for any integers $n_1, n_2$, yielding integer results for $n'_1, n'_2$.\nFor $n_1=1, n_2=0$, we must have $\\cos\\phi$ and $\\sin\\phi$ be integers. This only allows $\\phi = k \\cdot 90^\\circ$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSpecifically, for $\\phi = 90^\\circ$, we have $\\cos\\phi = 0$ and $\\sin\\phi = 1$, which maps $(n_1, n_2)$ to $(-n_2, n_1)$, which are integers. This confirms the existence of a 4-fold rotation axis ($C_4$) along $\\mathbf{a}_3$. This symmetry is a direct consequence of $a=b$. If $a \\neq b$, only $\\phi=180^\\circ$ would be a valid symmetry operation, leading to an orthorhombic system.\nThe presence of a single 4-fold rotation axis defines the **tetragonal crystal system**.\n\n**2. Centering and Bravais Lattices**\nThe metric of the conventional cell determines the crystal system. However, it does not, by itself, determine the Bravais lattice, which also involves specifying the arrangement of lattice points within the conventional cell (i.e., the centering).\nFor the tetragonal system, there are two distinct Bravais lattices:\n- **Primitive Tetragonal (tP):** The lattice points are located only at the corners of the conventional cell. This lattice is consistent with the given metric description.\n- **Body-Centered Tetragonal (tI):** The lattice points are located at the corners and at the body center, $\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{a}_1+\\mathbf{a}_2+\\mathbf{a}_3)$, of the conventional cell. This lattice also possesses the required tetragonal symmetry and is described by a conventional cell with the same metric.\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{ij}$ of the conventional cell vectors $\\{\\mathbf{a}_i\\}$ is identical for a tP lattice and a tI lattice with the same cell parameters $a$ and $c$. The metric alone is insufficient to distinguish between these two centering types. Information about centering must be obtained from other sources, such as the systematic absences in an X-ray diffraction experiment. Therefore, both primitive and body-centered tetragonal lattices are consistent with the provided metric description.\n\nOther proposed centerings for tetragonal lattices, such as base-centered (tC) or face-centered (tF), are not distinct Bravais lattices. A tC lattice can be re-indexed as a smaller tP lattice, and a tF lattice can be re-indexed as a tI lattice.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Primitive tetragonal only, because $a=b\\neq c$ and $\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=90^\\circ$ enforce a primitive cell with no centering.**\n**Incorrect.** The conditions on the cell parameters enforce the tetragonal symmetry but do not enforce a primitive cell. A body-centered arrangement is fully compatible with this symmetry.\n\n**B. Body-centered tetragonal only, because $a=b\\neq c$ and $\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=90^\\circ$ enforce a body-centered conventional cell.**\n**Incorrect.** For the same reason as A, these conditions do not enforce a body-centered cell. A primitive arrangement is also a valid possibility.\n\n**C. Tetragonal crystal system is enforced by the metric; the centering (primitive or body-centered) is not determined by the metric alone, so both primitive tetragonal and body-centered tetragonal are consistent.**\n**Correct.** This statement accurately summarizes the derivation. The metric ($a=b\\neq c$, orthogonality) dictates the point group symmetry, which is tetragonal. It does not, however, contain information about centering. Thus, both Bravais lattices belonging to the tetragonal system (tP and tI) are consistent with the information given.\n\n**D. Orthorhombic (any centering) is sufficient, because $\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=90^\\circ$ allows unequal axes and $a=b$ is just a special orthorhombic case without symmetry consequences.**\n**Incorrect.** The premise that $a=b$ has no symmetry consequences is a grave error. As demonstrated, this condition gives rise to a 4-fold rotation axis, which elevates the symmetry from orthorhombic to tetragonal. A lattice with a 4-fold axis is, by definition, not orthorhombic.\n\n**E. Base-centered tetragonal is required, because $a=b$ implies a base-centering vector in the basal plane.**\n**Incorrect.** First, $a=b$ does not imply base-centering; a primitive tetragonal lattice satisfies $a=b$. Second, a base-centered tetragonal lattice is not a distinct Bravais lattice, as it can be described by a smaller primitive tetragonal cell.

With a $2$-atom basis, the supercell contains $4 \\times 2 = 8$ atoms.\n\nWe now apply this to the given basis atoms:\n- Atom $A$: $\\mathbf{f}^{(A)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{3}{10}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n- Atom $B$: $\\mathbf{f}^{(B)} = \\left(\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$\nThe supercell coordinates $\\mathbf{F'}$ are calculated for each atom and each translation vector $\\mathbf{m}$.\n\n$1$. $\\mathbf{m} = (0,0,0)$:\n- Atom $A$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(A)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+0\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}+0\\right), \\left(\\frac{2}{5}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{3}{20}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n- Atom $B$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(B)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{10}+0\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+0\\right), \\left(\\frac{9}{10}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{20}, \\frac{1}{20}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$\n\n$2$. $\\mathbf{m} = (1,0,0)$:\n- Atom $A$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(A)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+1\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}+0\\right), \\left(\\frac{2}{5}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{6}{5}, \\frac{3}{20}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{3}{20}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n- Atom $B$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(B)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{10}+1\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+0\\right), \\left(\\frac{9}{10}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{17}{10}, \\frac{1}{20}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{17}{20}, \\frac{1}{20}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$\n\n$3$. $\\mathbf{m} = (0,1,0)$:\n- Atom $A$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(A)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+0\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}+1\\right), \\left(\\frac{2}{5}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{13}{10}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{13}{20}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n- Atom $B$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(B)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{10}+0\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+1\\right), \\left(\\frac{9}{10}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{20}, \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{11}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{20}, \\frac{11}{20}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$\n\n$4$. $\\mathbf{m} = (1,1,0)$:\n- Atom $A$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(A)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}+1\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}+1\\right), \\left(\\frac{2}{5}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{13}{20}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n- Atom $B$: $\\mathbf{F'}^{(B)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{10}+1\\right), \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{10}+1\\right), \\left(\\frac{9}{10}+0\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{17}{20}, \\frac{11}{20}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$\n\nThe complete, ordered list of supercell fractional coordinate triplets is constructed by flattening these results according to the specified sequence.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{10} & \\frac{3}{20} & \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{7}{20} & \\frac{1}{20} & \\frac{9}{10} & \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{3}{20} & \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{17}{20} & \\frac{1}{20} & \\frac{9}{10} & \\frac{1}{10} & \\frac{13}{20} & \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{7}{20} & \\frac{11}{20} & \\frac{9}{10} & \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{13}{20} & \\frac{2}{5} & \\frac{17}{20} & \\frac{11}{20} & \\frac{9}{10} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2477483"}]}
