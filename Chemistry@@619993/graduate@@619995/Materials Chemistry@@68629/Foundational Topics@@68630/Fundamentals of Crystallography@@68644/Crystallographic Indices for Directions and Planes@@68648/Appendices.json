It describes a standard procedure in crystallography for determining the Miller indices of a plane from its intercepts with the crystallographic axes. The given data are complete, consistent, and physically realistic. The terminology is precise and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, or mathematics. It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to the topic of crystallographic indices.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe determination of Miller indices, denoted as $(hkl)$, for a crystallographic plane is a systematic procedure based on the intercepts of the plane with the crystallographic axes. The procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the intercepts**: The first step is to determine the points where the plane intersects the axes defined by the lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{b}$, and $\\mathbf{c}$. The problem statement provides these intercepts directly: the plane intersects the $a$-axis at infinity, the $b$-axis at a distance of $2b$ from the origin, and the $c$-axis at a distance of $-3c$ from the origin. An intercept at infinity signifies that the plane is parallel to that axis.\n\n2.  **Normalize the intercepts**: The intercepts must be expressed as dimensionless multiples of the respective lattice parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let the normalized intercepts be $p$, $q$, and $r$.\n    -   Intercept on the $a$-axis is $\\infty$. Thus, the normalized intercept is $p = \\infty$.\n    -   Intercept on the $b$-axis is $2b$. Thus, the normalized intercept is $q = \\frac{2b}{b} = 2$.\n    -   Intercept on the $c$-axis is $-3c$. Thus, the normalized intercept is $r = \\frac{-3c}{c} = -3$.\n    The set of normalized intercepts is $(\\infty, 2, -3)$.\n\n3.  **Take the reciprocals**: The Miller indices are related to the reciprocals of these normalized intercepts.\n    -   For the $a$-axis, the reciprocal of $p = \\infty$ is $\\frac{1}{\\infty} = 0$.\n    -   For the $b$-axis, the reciprocal of $q = 2$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    -   For the $c$-axis, the reciprocal of $r = -3$ is $-\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    This yields the triplet of fractional indices $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$.\n\n4.  **Clear fractions**: By definition, Miller indices must be a set of three integers. To convert the fractional triplet into integers, one must find a common multiplier that clears all fractions. This is achieved by multiplying each number by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. The denominators are $2$ and $3$. The LCM of $2$ and $3$ is $6$.\n    We multiply the triplet $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$ by this LCM:\n    -   $h = 0 \\times 6 = 0$\n    -   $k = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3$\n    -   $l = -\\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = -2$\n\n5.  **Final Indices**: The resulting integers $(h, k, l)$ are the Miller indices of the plane. These integers should be the smallest possible set, which is ensured by using the LCM. The Miller indices for the given plane are therefore $(0, 3, -2)$. In crystallographic notation, a negative index is conventionally written with an overbar, as $(03\\bar{2})$, but the requested format is a triplet of integers. The indices $(0, 3, -2)$ represent a plane parallel to the $a$-axis, which is consistent with the initial condition of an infinite intercept along that axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2478947"}, {"introduction": "Miller indices are more than just a labeling system; they are directly linked to the measurable properties of a crystal.

Body-centered cubic (bcc) Bravais lattice; allowed reflections satisfy $h+k+l$ even; reflections with $h+k+l$ odd are systematically absent.\nThe selection rule is correctly stated for bcc. However, the predicted reflection pattern for bcc (allowed $N = \\{2,4,6,8,...\\}$) does not match the experimental data. **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice; allowed reflections satisfy that $h,k,l$ are either all even or all odd; reflections with mixed parity in $h,k,l$ are systematically absent.\nThe lattice type (fcc), the selection rule (unmixed parity), and the resulting diffraction pattern all perfectly match the experimental data derived from first principles. **Correct**.\n\nC. Primitive (simple) cubic Bravais lattice; all $(hkl)$ with integers $h,k,l$ are allowed.\nThe selection rule is correctly stated for sc. However, this would mean peaks at $N=1$ and $N=2$ should be observed, but they are explicitly stated as absent. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Body-centered cubic (bcc) Bravais lattice; allowed reflections satisfy that $h,k,l$ are all odd only; reflections with any even index are systematically absent.\nThis is an incorrect statement of the selection rule for a bcc lattice. The correct rule is $h+k+l$ even. For example, $(200)$ is an allowed bcc reflection, but it has even indices. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice; allowed reflections satisfy $h+k+l$ even; reflections with $h+k+l$ odd are systematically absent.\nThe specified lattice is fcc, but the selection rule ($h+k+l$ even) is that for a bcc lattice. These are contradictory. The correct fcc rule allows the $(111)$ reflection, for which $h+k+l=3$ (odd), which would be forbidden by the rule stated in this option. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2478807"}]}
