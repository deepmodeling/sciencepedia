Treat the configuration as rigid and assume no other atoms are present.

It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system consists of a set of $4$ identical atoms. Let us label the positions for clarity:\nAtom $1$ is at $\\mathbf{p}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$.\nAtom $2$ is at $\\mathbf{p}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$.\nAtom $3$ is at $\\mathbf{p}_3 = (-1, 0, 0)$.\nAtom $4$ is at $\\mathbf{p}_4 = (0, -1, 0)$.\nThe set of all atomic positions is $S = \\{\\mathbf{p}_1, \\mathbf{p}_2, \\mathbf{p}_3, \\mathbf{p}_4\\}$.\n\nThe first task is to determine whether the inversion operation, $i$, is a symmetry operation for this configuration. The inversion operation is defined to map a point with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ to $(-x, -y, -z)$. For $i$ to be a symmetry operation, the set of transformed positions, $i(S) = \\{i(\\mathbf{p}_1), i(\\mathbf{p}_2), i(\\mathbf{p}_3), i(\\mathbf{p}_4)\\}$, must be identical to the original set $S$. We apply the operation to each atomic position individually.\n\nThe action of the inversion operation $i$ on the position vector $\\mathbf{p}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$ is:\n$$i(\\mathbf{p}_1) = i(1, 0, 0) = (-1, -0, -0) = (-1, 0, 0)$$\nThis resulting position vector, $(-1, 0, 0)$, is identical to $\\mathbf{p}_3$.\n\nThe action of $i$ on $\\mathbf{p}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$ is:\n$$i(\\mathbf{p}_2) = i(0, 1, 0) = (-0, -1, -0) = (0, -1, 0)$$\nThis resulting position vector, $(0, -1, 0)$, is identical to $\\mathbf{p}_4$.\n\nThe action of $i$ on $\\mathbf{p}_3 = (-1, 0, 0)$ is:\n$$i(\\mathbf{p}_3) = i(-1, 0, 0) = (-(-1), -0, -0) = (1, 0, 0)$$\nThis resulting position vector, $(1, 0, 0)$, is identical to $\\mathbf{p}_1$.\n\nThe action of $i$ on $\\mathbf{p}_4 = (0, -1, 0)$ is:\n$$i(\\mathbf{p}_4) = i(0, -1, 0) = (-0, -(-1), -0) = (0, 1, 0)$$\nThis resulting position vector, $(0, 1, 0)$, is identical to $\\mathbf{p}_2$.\n\nThe set of transformed positions is $\\{i(\\mathbf{p}_1), i(\\mathbf{p}_2), i(\\mathbf{p}_3), i(\\mathbf{p}_4)\\} = \\{\\mathbf{p}_3, \\mathbf{p}_4, \\mathbf{p}_1, \\mathbf{p}_2\\}$. This is merely a permutation of the original set of positions $S = \\{\\mathbf{p}_1, \\mathbf{p}_2, \\mathbf{p}_3, \\mathbf{p}_4\\}$. Since the set of positions is mapped onto itself, the inversion operation $i$ is indeed a symmetry operation for this atomic configuration.\n\nThe second task is to construct the induced permutation of the $4$ atomic sites and compute the character $\\chi(i)$ of the permutation representation. The permutation describes how the labels of the atoms are interchanged. From our analysis above:\n- Atom at position $1$ moves to the site of atom $3$.\n- Atom at position $2$ moves to the site of atom $4$.\n- Atom at position $3$ moves to the site of atom $1$.\n- Atom at position $4$ moves to the site of atom $2$.\n\nThis permutation of the labels $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ can be written in Cauchy two-line notation as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nOr, more compactly, in cycle notation as $(1 \\, 3)(2 \\, 4)$.\n\nThe character of a permutation representation, $\\chi(i)$, is defined as the trace of the corresponding permutation matrix. The permutation matrix $P(i)$ is a $4 \\times 4$ matrix where the element $P_{jk}$ is $1$ if the operation sends atom $k$ to site $j$, and $0$ otherwise. Based on the permutation, the matrix is:\n$$\nP(i) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of this matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\chi(i) = \\text{Tr}(P(i)) = P_{11} + P_{22} + P_{33} + P_{44} = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nAn equivalent and more direct method for finding the character of a permutation representation is to count the number of sites that are left unmoved by the operation. The character is equal to this number. In the permutation $(1 \\, 3)(2 \\, 4)$, atom $1$ is mapped to $3$, $3$ to $1$, $2$ to $4$, and $4$ to $2$. No atom is mapped onto its original position. Therefore, the number of unmoved atoms is $0$. This confirms our calculation of the trace. The character $\\chi(i)$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2528174"}, {"introduction": "Expanding from the symmetry of finite molecules to that of infinite crystals requires incorporating translational symmetry.

The problem is stated with objective and precise language. It is complete, consistent, and formalizable. The scenario is physically realistic. It is a standard, non-trivial problem that requires a systematic application of the projection operator formalism. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to find the Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combination (SALC) corresponding to the totally symmetric irreducible representation, $A_{1}$, of the $C_{3v}$ point group. This is achieved using the projection operator formalism. The projection operator $\\hat{P}^{(\\Gamma)}$ for a given irreducible representation $\\Gamma$ of a group $G$ is defined as:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(\\Gamma)} = \\frac{l_{\\Gamma}}{h} \\sum_{R \\in G} \\chi^{(\\Gamma)}(R)^* \\hat{R} $$\nIn this formula, $h$ is the order of the group, $l_{\\Gamma}$ is the dimension of the irrep $\\Gamma$, the summation extends over all symmetry operations $R$ in the group, $\\chi^{(\\Gamma)}(R)$ is the character of the operation $R$ in the irrep $\\Gamma$, and $\\hat{R}$ is the operator corresponding to the symmetry operation $R$. The asterisk indicates complex conjugation.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters for the $C_{3v}$ group and the $A_{1}$ irrep. The group $C_{3v}$ consists of the operations $\\{E, C_{3}^{+}, C_{3}^{-}, \\sigma_{v}^{(1)}, \\sigma_{v}^{(2)}, \\sigma_{v}^{(3)}\\}$. The total number of operations, which is the order of the group, is $h=6$.\nThe target irrep is the totally symmetric representation, $A_{1}$. By definition, this representation is one-dimensional, so its dimension is $l_{A_1}=1$. The characters for the $A_{1}$ irrep are all equal to $1$; that is, $\\chi^{(A_1)}(R) = 1$ for all $R \\in C_{3v}$. As all characters are real numbers, the complex conjugation in the formula is inconsequential.\n\nWe construct the projection operator $\\hat{P}^{(A_1)}$ by substituting these values into the general formula:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(A_1)} = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{R \\in C_{3v}} (1) \\hat{R} = \\frac{1}{6} (\\hat{E} + \\hat{C}_{3}^{+} + \\hat{C}_{3}^{-} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(1)} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(2)} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(3)}) $$\nNext, we apply this operator to one of the basis functions to generate the SALC. We choose $\\phi_{1}$ as the starting function without loss of generality. The problem states that the orbitals are permuted according to the action of the symmetry operations on the vertices. The transformation of $\\phi_{1}$ under each of the $6$ operations is as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\hat{E}\\phi_{1} = \\phi_{1}$ (The identity operation leaves the orbital unchanged.)\n    \\item $\\hat{C}_{3}^{+}\\phi_{1} = \\phi_{2}$ (A counterclockwise rotation by $2\\pi/3$ sends vertex $1$ to position $2$.)\n    \\item $\\hat{C}_{3}^{-}\\phi_{1} = \\phi_{3}$ (A clockwise rotation by $2\\pi/3$ sends vertex $1$ to position $3$.)\n    \\item $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(1)}\\phi_{1} = \\phi_{1}$ (The mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}^{(1)}$ passes through vertex $1$, leaving it invariant.)\n    \\item $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(2)}\\phi_{1} = \\phi_{3}$ (The mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}^{(2)}$ passes through vertex $2$ and interchanges vertices $1$ and $3$.)\n    \\item $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(3)}\\phi_{1} = \\phi_{2}$ (The mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}^{(3)}$ passes through vertex $3$ and interchanges vertices $1$ and $2$.)\n\\end{itemize}\nWe now apply the projection operator to $\\phi_{1}$ by summing these transformed functions:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(A_1)}\\phi_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} (\\hat{E}\\phi_{1} + \\hat{C}_{3}^{+}\\phi_{1} + \\hat{C}_{3}^{-}\\phi_{1} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(1)}\\phi_{1} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(2)}\\phi_{1} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}^{(3)}\\phi_{1}) $$\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(A_1)}\\phi_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} (\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3} + \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} + \\phi_{2}) $$\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(A_1)}\\phi_{1} = \\frac{1}{6} (2\\phi_{1} + 2\\phi_{2} + 2\\phi_{3}) = \\frac{1}{3} (\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3}) $$\nThe resulting function is the SALC of $A_{1}$ symmetry. Any constant multiple is also a valid representation, so we may take the unnormalized SALC as $\\psi_{A_1, \\text{unnorm}} = \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3}$.\n\nThe final step is to normalize this function. Let the normalized SALC be $\\Psi_{A_1} = N(\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3})$, where $N$ is the normalization constant. The normalization condition is $\\langle \\Psi_{A_1} | \\Psi_{A_1} \\rangle = 1$.
