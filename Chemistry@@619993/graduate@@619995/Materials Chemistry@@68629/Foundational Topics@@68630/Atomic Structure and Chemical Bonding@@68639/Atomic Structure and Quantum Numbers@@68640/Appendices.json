A common method for estimating this shielding is through a set of empirical guidelines known as Slater's rules, which calculate a shielding constant ($S$). The effective nuclear charge is then given by the relation $Z_{eff} = Z - S$.\n\nTo calculate the shielding constant $S$ for a specific electron, Slater's rules are as follows:\n1.  Write out the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals in the following manner: $(1s)$, $(2s, 2p)$, $(3s, 3p)$, $(3d)$, $(4s, 4p)$, $(4d)$, $(4f)$, etc.\n2.  Any electrons in groups to the right of the group containing the electron of interest contribute nothing to the shielding constant.\n3.
