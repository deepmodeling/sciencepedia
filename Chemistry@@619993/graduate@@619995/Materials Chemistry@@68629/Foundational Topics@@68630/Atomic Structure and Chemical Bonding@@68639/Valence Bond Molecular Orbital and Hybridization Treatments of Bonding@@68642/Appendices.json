This exercise provides fundamental, hands-on practice in applying group theory to construct the basic building blocks of molecular orbitals.

Units are not applicable.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution under the standard conventions of applied group theory. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) for the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals in ammonia, $\\text{NH}_3$, which belongs to the $C_{3v}$ point group. The final goal is to find the normalized coefficient vector for the totally symmetric SALC. The designated basis set is $\\{\\phi_{a}, \\phi_{b}, \\phi_{c}\\}$, representing the three H $1s$ orbitals.\n\nFirst, we require the character table for the $C_{3v}$ point group. The group has three classes of symmetry operations: the identity $E$, two rotations $C_3$ (clockwise and counterclockwise), and three vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_v$. The order of the group is $h=6$. The character table is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc|l}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v & \\\\\n\\hline\nA_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & z, z^2, x^2+y^2 \\\\\nA_2 & 1 & 1 & -1 & R_z \\\\\nE & 2 & -1 & 0 & (x, y), (xz, yz), (x^2-y^2, xy) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe first step is to determine the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{H}$, generated by the basis of the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals, $\\{\\phi_{a}, \\phi_{b}, \\phi_{c}\\}$. The character of a representation for a given symmetry operation is the trace of the transformation matrix, which simplifies to the number of basis functions that are left unchanged (not shifted to a new position) by that operation.\n\nThe action of the symmetry operations on the basis orbitals is as follows:\n1.  $\\hat{E}$: The identity operation leaves all three orbitals in place. $\\hat{E}(\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c) = (\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c)$. The number of unshifted orbitals is $3$. Thus, $\\chi_{H}(E) = 3$.\n2.  $\\hat{C}_3$: The rotation by $2\\pi/3$ permutes the orbitals cyclically, for instance, $\\phi_a \\rightarrow \\phi_b \\rightarrow \\phi_c \\rightarrow \\phi_a$. No orbital is left in its original position. The number of unshifted orbitals is $0$. Thus, $\\chi_{H}(C_3) = 0$.\n3.  $\\hat{\\sigma}_v$: Each of the three vertical mirror planes contains the nitrogen atom and one hydrogen atom, and bisects the angle between the other two hydrogens. For a plane containing H$_a$, the orbital $\\phi_a$ is unshifted, while $\\phi_b$ and $\\phi_c$ are interchanged. Therefore, for any of the $\\sigma_v$ operations, exactly one H $1s$ orbital is left unshifted. The number of unshifted orbitals is $1$. Thus, $\\chi_{H}(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\n\nThe character set for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{H}$ is therefore $(3, 0, 1)$.\n\nNext, we decompose $\\Gamma_{H}$ into its constituent irreducible representations (irreps). The number of times an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ is contained in $\\Gamma_H$ is given by the formula:\n$$ n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\cdot \\chi_i(R) \\cdot \\chi_H(R) $$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the number of operations in the class of $R$, $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the irrep $\\Gamma_i$ for the operation class $R$, and $\\chi_H(R)$ is the character of the reducible representation $\\Gamma_H$ for the class $R$.\n\nFor $A_1$:\n$$ n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} [ (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3) + (2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0) + (3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) ] = \\frac{1}{6} [3 + 0 + 3] = 1 $$\nFor $A_2$:\n$$ n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} [ (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3) + (2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0) + (3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1) ] = \\frac{1}{6} [3 + 0 - 3] = 0 $$\nFor $E$:\n$$ n_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} [ (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3) + (2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0) + (3 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1) ] = \\frac{1}{6} [6 + 0 + 0] = 1 $$\nThe decomposition is $\\Gamma_{H} = A_1 + E$. This indicates that the three H $1s$ orbitals combine to form one SALC of $A_1$ symmetry (the totally symmetric one) and a degenerate pair of SALCs of $E$ symmetry.\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficients of the totally symmetric SALC. We will use the projection operator method to generate this SALC. The projection operator $\\hat{P}^{(i)}$ for an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(i)} \\propto \\sum_{R} \\chi_i(R) \\hat{R} $$\nWe apply this operator to one of the basis functions, for example, $\\phi_a$. For the totally symmetric irrep $A_1$, the characters are all $1$.\nThe set of six operations in the group is $\\{E, C_3, C_3^2, \\sigma_{v(a)}, \\sigma_{v(b)}, \\sigma_{v(c)}\\}$. We define the actions of these operators on the chosen basis function $\\phi_a$:\n- $\\hat{E}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_a$\n- $\\hat{C}_3(\\phi_a) = \\phi_b$\n- $\\hat{C}_3^2(\\phi_a) = \\phi_c$\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(a)}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_a$ (where $\\sigma_{v(a)}$ is the plane containing H$_a$)\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(b)}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_c$ (where $\\sigma_{v(b)}$ is the plane containing H$_b$)\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(c)}(\\phi_a) = \\phi_b$ (where $\\sigma_{v(c)}$ is the plane containing H$_c$)\n\nApplying the projector for $A_1$ symmetry:\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} = \\hat{P}^{(A_1)} \\phi_a \\propto \\sum_{R} \\chi_{A_1}(R) \\hat{R}(\\phi_a) $$\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} \\propto (1)\\hat{E}(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{C}_3(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{C}_3^2(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(a)}(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(b)}(\\phi_a) + (1)\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(c)}(\\phi_a) $$\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} \\propto \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c + \\phi_a + \\phi_c + \\phi_b = 2\\phi_a + 2\\phi_b + 2\\phi_c $$\nDropping the common factor of $2$, the unnormalized SALC for $A_1$ symmetry is:\n$$ \\Psi'_{A_1} = \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c $$\nFinally, we must normalize this SALC. The normalization condition is $\\langle \\Psi_{A_1} | \\Psi_{A_1} \\rangle = 1$. Let $N$ be the normalization constant, such that $\\Psi_{A_1} = N \\Psi'_{A_1}$.\n$$ \\langle N(\\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c) | N(\\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c) \\rangle = 1 $$\n$$ N^2 \\langle \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c | \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c \\rangle = 1 $$\nAssuming the atomic orbitals form an orthonormal set, i.e., $\\langle \\phi_i | \\phi_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$ (where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta), the inner product becomes:\n$$ \\langle \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c | \\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c \\rangle = \\langle \\phi_a | \\phi_a \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_b | \\phi_b \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_c | \\phi_c \\rangle = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\nSo, $N^2 \\cdot 3 = 1$, which gives $N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe normalized totally symmetric SALC is:\n$$ \\Psi_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\phi_a + \\phi_b + \\phi_c) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\phi_a + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\phi_b + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\phi_c $$\nThis function is expressed as a linear combination of the basis functions $(\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c)$.

The Mulliken scheme is founded on the principle of equal partitioning of this overlap population: half is assigned to atom A (containing $\\chi_\\mu$) and half to atom B (containing $\\chi_\\nu$).\n\nThe Mulliken gross atomic population $N_A$ on an atom $A$ is the sum of the net populations of its orbitals plus half of the overlap populations with all other orbitals.\n$$ N_A = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} P_{\\mu\\mu} + \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} \\sum_{\\nu \\notin A} P_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu} $$\nThis expression is equivalent to summing the diagonal elements of the product matrix $M=PS$ corresponding to atom $A$:\n$$ N_A = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} (PS)_{\\mu\\mu} = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} \\sum_{\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\nu\\mu} $$\nThe Mulliken net charge on atom $A$ is then $q_A = z_A^{\\mathrm{val}} - N_A$, where $z_A^{\\mathrm{val}}$ is the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom.\n\nThe Mulliken bond order $B_{AB}$ between two atoms $A$ and $B$ is defined as the sum of all overlap populations between them:\n$$ B_{AB} = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} \\sum_{\\nu \\in B} 2 P_{\\mu\\nu} S_{\\mu\\nu} $$\nThis quantity represents the total electron population shared in the bonding regions between atoms $A$ and $B$.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the given problem. We have a diatomic fragment with one AO per atom: $\\chi_1$ on atom $A$ and $\\chi_2$ on atom $B$. The provided matrices are:\n$$ P = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{11} & P_{12} \\\\ P_{21} & P_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.90 & 0.50 \\\\ 0.50 & 0.90 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad S = \\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.00 & 0.20 \\\\ 0.20 & 1.00 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe valence electron counts are $z_{A}^{\\mathrm{val}}=1$ and $z_{B}^{\\mathrm{val}}=1$.\n\nFirst, we compute the gross atomic populations $N_A$ and $N_B$. These are given by the diagonal elements of the matrix $M=PS$, which we calculated earlier as $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.00 & 0.68 \\\\ 0.68 & 1.00 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$ N_A = M_{11} = 1.00 $$\n$$ N_B = M_{22} = 1.00 $$\nNext, we compute the Mulliken net charges $q_A$ and $q_B$:\n$$ q_A = z_{A}^{\\mathrm{val}} - N_A = 1 - 1.00 = 0.00 $$\n$$ q_B = z_{B}^{\\mathrm{val}} - N_B = 1 - 1.00 = 0.00 $$\nThe atoms are neutral, which is expected from the symmetry of the problem.\n\nFinally, we compute the Mulliken bond order between atoms $A$ and $B$. The sum runs over $\\mu=1$ and $\\nu=2$:\n$$ B_{AB} = 2 P_{12} S_{12} $$\nSubstituting the given values $P_{12} = 0.50$ and $S_{12} = 0.20$:\n$$ B_{AB} = 2 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.20 = 1.00 \\times 0.20 = 0.20 $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the value is $0.2000$.\nThis represents the total shared electron population in the overlap region between the two atoms, which is the quantitative measure of the bond order in the Mulliken scheme.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2000}\n$$", "id": "2535171"}]}
