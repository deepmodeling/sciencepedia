Adopt the usual ligand field picture: the five metal $d$ orbitals split into a lower-energy triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy doubly degenerate $e_{g}$ set. Take the spherical (barycentric) average energy of the $d$ manifold as zero. The octahedral splitting parameter is $\\Delta_{o}$, defined as the energy separation between the $e_{g}$ and $t_{2g}$ levels. The Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) is defined here as the stabilization due solely to the redistribution of the $d$-electron density among the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels relative to the barycenter, neglecting all interelectronic repulsion and pairing energies. Use the following physical facts as your starting point:\n- The $t_{2g}$ set has degeneracy $3$ and the $e_{g}$ set has degeneracy $2$.\n- The trace (barycenter) condition requires that the degeneracy-weighted mean energy of the split levels equals the unsplit barycenter.\n- The Pauli exclusion principle and Hundâ€™s rule of maximum multiplicity govern electron placement.\nFrom this base, first deduce the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels relative to the barycenter in terms of $\\Delta_{o}$. Then, for each $n$ from $0$ to $10$, compute the LFSE for both the weak-field (high-spin) and strong-field (low-spin) electron configurations.

No rounding is required. Do not include units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It represents a standard, fundamental exercise in ligand field theory. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we must determine the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals relative to the barycenter, which is set to an energy of $0$. Let these energies be $E(t_{2g})$ and $E(e_g)$, respectively. The problem provides two critical conditions.\n\n1.  The energy separation between the levels is the octahedral splitting parameter, $\\Delta_{o}$:\n    $$E(e_g) - E(t_{2g}) = \\Delta_{o}$$\n2.  The barycenter condition requires that the degeneracy-weighted mean energy of the split levels remains at the energy of the unsplit manifold, which is $0$. Given the degeneracies $d_{t_{2g}}=3$ and $d_{e_g}=2$, this condition is expressed as:\n    $$d_{t_{2g}}E(t_{2g}) + d_{e_g}E(e_g) = 3 E(t_{2g}) + 2 E(e_g) = 0$$\n\nWe now have a system of $2$ linear equations for the $2$ unknowns, $E(t_{2g})$ and $E(e_g)$. From the first equation, we can express $E(e_g)$ in terms of $E(t_{2g})$:\n$$E(e_g) = E(t_{2g}) + \\Delta_{o}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the second equation yields:\n$$3 E(t_{2g}) + 2 (E(t_{2g)} + \\Delta_{o}) = 0$$\n$$5 E(t_{2g}) + 2 \\Delta_{o} = 0$$\nSolving for $E(t_{2g})$ gives:\n$$E(t_{2g}) = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}$$\nSubstituting this result back to find $E(e_g)$:\n$$E(e_g) = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o} + \\Delta_{o} = +\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}$$\nThus, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are stabilized by $\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}$ and the $e_g$ orbitals are destabilized by $\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}$ relative to the barycenter.\n\nNext, we establish the formula for the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE). For an electronic configuration $(t_{2g})^{n_{t_{2g}}} (e_g)^{n_{e_g}}$, where $n_{t_{2g}}$ and $n_{e_g}$ are the electron occupancies of the respective levels, the LFSE is defined as:\n$$\\text{LFSE} = n_{t_{2g}} E(t_{2g}) + n_{e_g} E(e_g) = n_{t_{2g}}\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + n_{e_g}}\\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right)$$\nThe problem requires the dimensionless quantity $\\text{LFSE}/\\Delta_{o}$, which is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{LFSE}}{\\Delta_{o}} = -\\frac{2}{5} n_{t_{2g}} + \\frac{3}{5} n_{e_g}$$\nWe will now apply this formula for each electron count $n$ from $0$ to $10$ for both high-spin and low-spin cases.\n\n**High-Spin (Weak-Field) Configurations**\nIn the high-spin case, electrons occupy orbitals to maximize total spin multiplicity (Hund's rule).

The active site of these proteins features a copper ion coordinated by amino acid residues. In its oxidized state, the site contains a Copper(II) ion, which has a $d^9$ electronic configuration. Spectroscopic and crystallographic studies reveal that the coordination geometry around the Cu(II) center is a distorted tetrahedron. Specifically, the copper is typically bound to two histidine nitrogen atoms and a cysteine sulfur atom in a trigonal plane, with a fourth, more distant axial bond to a methionine sulfur atom. This arrangement deviates significantly from a regular, symmetric tetrahedron.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate electronic reason for this inherent structural distortion from a perfect tetrahedral geometry for the $d^9$ Cu(II) center?\n\nA. The large size of the sulfur-containing ligands compared to the nitrogen-containing ligands creates significant steric hindrance, forcing the geometry to distort to minimize non-bonded interactions.\n\nB. The high positive charge of the Cu(II) ion causes strong polarization of the ligands, which is asymmetrically relieved by altering the bond lengths and angles from the ideal tetrahedral values.\n\nC. In a perfect tetrahedral geometry, the highest-energy d-orbitals are degenerate.
