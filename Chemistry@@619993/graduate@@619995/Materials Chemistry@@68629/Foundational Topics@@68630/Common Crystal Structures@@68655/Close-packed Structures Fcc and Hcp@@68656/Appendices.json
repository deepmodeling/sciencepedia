We shall proceed with the analysis for each structure as specified. The analysis is based on the hard-sphere model, where atoms are represented as identical, impenetrable spheres of radius $r$. The packing fraction, denoted $\\eta$, is defined as the ratio of the volume of spheres within a unit cell to the volume of the unit cell itself.\n\nPart 1: Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) Structure\n\nThe conventional unit cell of the face-centered cubic structure is a cube with lattice parameter $a$. Spheres are located at the $8$ corners of the cube and at the center of each of its $6$ faces.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of spheres, $Z_{fcc}$, associated with one unit cell. A sphere at a corner is shared by $8$ adjacent cells, and a sphere at a face center is shared by $2$ adjacent cells.\n$$Z_{fcc} = \\left(8 \\text{ corners} \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{\\text{sphere}}{\\text{corner}}\\right) + \\left(6 \\text{ faces} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\text{sphere}}{\\text{face}}\\right) = 1 + 3 = 4$$\nThus, there are $4$ spheres per fcc unit cell.\n\nThe total volume of these spheres, $V_{spheres, fcc}$, is:\n$$V_{spheres, fcc} = Z_{fcc} \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = 4 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{16}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the lattice parameter $a$ and the sphere radius $r$. In the fcc structure, spheres are in contact along the face diagonal of the cube. The length of the face diagonal is given by the Pythagorean theorem as $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$. This diagonal spans one full diameter ($2r$) of the face-centered sphere and two radii ($r$) from the corner spheres. The total length is therefore $r + 2r + r = 4r$.\nEquating these two expressions for the face diagonal length:\n$$a\\sqrt{2} = 4r$$\nFrom this, we solve for $a$ in terms of $r$:\n$$a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2}r$$\n\nThe volume of the cubic unit cell, $V_{cell, fcc}$, is $a^3$.\n$$V_{cell, fcc} = a^3 = (2\\sqrt{2}r)^3 = 8 \\times 2\\sqrt{2} \\times r^3 = 16\\sqrt{2}r^3$$\n\nFinally, the packing fraction for the fcc structure, $\\eta_{fcc}$, is the ratio of the sphere volume to the cell volume:\n$$\\eta_{fcc} = \\frac{V_{spheres, fcc}}{V_{cell, fcc}} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi r^3}{16\\sqrt{2}r^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nPart 2: Hexagonal Close-Packed (hcp) Structure\n\nThe conventional hcp unit cell is a right prism with a regular hexagonal base of side length $a$ and a height $c$.\n\nFirst, we relate the base edge length $a$ to the sphere radius $r$. The spheres at the corners of the hexagonal base are in contact with each other. Therefore, the distance between the centers of adjacent spheres is $2r$, which is equal to the edge length $a$.\n$$a = 2r$$\n\nNext, we derive the ideal $c/a$ ratio. The hcp structure consists of stacked close-packed layers in an ABAB... sequence. Consider a sphere in a B-layer resting in the hollow formed by three touching spheres in the A-layer below. The centers of these three spheres in the A-layer form an equilateral triangle with side length $a$. The center of the B-layer sphere is positioned directly above the centroid of this triangle.\n\nThe distance from a vertex to the centroid of an equilateral triangle of side $a$ is $d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$. A right-angled triangle is formed by the following points: the center of a sphere in layer A, the centroid of the base triangle, and the center of the sphere in layer B above it. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the distance between the center of the A-sphere and the B-sphere, which is $a = 2r$ because they are in contact. The legs of the right triangle are the horizontal distance $d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and the vertical distance, which is half the cell height, $\\frac{c}{2}$.\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 + d^2 = a^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = a^2$$\n$$\\frac{c^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{3} = a^2$$\n$$\\frac{c^2}{4} = a^2 - \\frac{a^2}{3} = \\frac{2a^2}{3}$$\n$$c^2 = \\frac{8a^2}{3}$$\nThis gives the ideal height $c = a\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}}$. The ideal ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{c}{a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\nNow we determine the number of spheres, $Z_{hcp}$, in the conventional hexagonal unit cell. The spheres are located at the $12$ corners of the prism, at the centers of the top and bottom hexagonal faces, and as $3$ spheres fully contained within the prism volume.\n- A corner sphere is shared by $6$ unit cells: $12 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 2$ spheres.\n- A face-centered sphere is shared by $2$ unit cells: $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ sphere.\n- The internal spheres are not shared: $3 \\times 1 = 3$ spheres.\nThe total number of spheres is:\n$$Z_{hcp} = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6$$\n\nThe total volume of these spheres, $V_{spheres, hcp}$, is:\n$$V_{spheres, hcp} = Z_{hcp} \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = 6 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = 8\\pi r^3$$\n\nThe volume of the hcp unit cell, $V_{cell, hcp}$, is the area of the hexagonal base multiplied by the height $c$. The area of a regular hexagon with side $a$ is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2$.\n$$V_{cell, hcp} = (\\text{Base Area}) \\times c = \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2\\right)c$$\nSubstituting $c = a\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}}$:\n$$V_{cell, hcp} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2 \\left(a\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}}\\right) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^3 \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = 3\\sqrt{2} a^3$$\nNow, substituting $a = 2r$:\n$$V_{cell, hcp} = 3\\sqrt{2}(2r)^3 = 3\\sqrt{2}(8r^3) = 24\\sqrt{2}r^3$$\n\nThe packing fraction for the hcp structure, $\\eta_{hcp}$, is:\n$$\\eta_{hcp} = \\frac{V_{spheres, hcp}}{V_{cell, hcp}} = \\frac{8\\pi r^3}{24\\sqrt{2}r^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nComparison of Results\n\nThe derived packing fractions for the fcc and hcp structures are:\n$$\\eta_{fcc} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}$$\n$$\\eta_{hcp} = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe results are identical, as expected. Both fcc and hcp are arrangements that achieve the maximum possible packing density for identical spheres. This maximal packing fraction is a fundamental constant in discrete geometry.\n\nThe common value is $\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}}$$", "id": "2473183"}, {"introduction": "While the packing fraction quantifies the occupied volume in a crystal, the unoccupied voids, or interstitial sites, are equally crucial for a material's chemistry and properties.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient information through the specified geometry (hard spheres of radius $r$ with a nearest-neighbor center-to-center separation of $2r$) to uniquely determine the size of the interstitial sites. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard, formalizable geometric exercise that does not violate any scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and possesses a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by analyzing the specific geometry of the host spheres' centers that define each type of interstitial site. The condition that the inserted sphere touches all bounding host spheres provides the key geometric constraint.\n\nDerivation for the Octahedral Hole Radius Ratio ($r_{\\mathrm{oct}}/r$)\n\nAn octahedral hole in a close-packed lattice is defined by $6$ host spheres whose centers form a regular octahedron. Let us establish a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin $(0,0,0)$ at the center of this octahedron. This origin will also be the center of the inserted interstitial sphere.\n\nThe $6$ centers of the host spheres can be placed symmetrically on the axes at positions $(\\pm L, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm L, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \\pm L)$ for some distance $L$ from the origin.\n\nThe problem states that nearest-neighbor host spheres are in contact, with a center-to-center separation of $2r$. In this arrangement, any two non-opposing sphere centers are nearest neighbors. For instance, consider the spheres centered at $(L, 0, 0)$ and $(0, L, 0)$. The distance $d$ between their centers is given by the distance formula:\n$$d = \\sqrt{(L-0)^{2} + (0-L)^{2} + (0-0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{L^{2} + L^{2}} = \\sqrt{2L^{2}} = L\\sqrt{2}$$\nWe equate this distance to the given nearest-neighbor separation of $2r$:\n$$L\\sqrt{2} = 2r$$\nFrom this, we solve for $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}} = r\\sqrt{2}$$\nNow, consider the small sphere of radius $r_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ placed at the origin. For it to fit perfectly, it must be tangent to each of the $6$ host spheres. The distance from the center of the interstitial sphere (the origin) to the center of any host sphere (e.g., at $(L, 0, 0)$) is simply $L$. This distance must also be equal to the sum of the radius of the host sphere, $r$, and the radius of the interstitial sphere, $r_{\\mathrm{oct}}$.\n$$L = r + r_{\\mathrm{oct}}$$\nSubstituting the expression we found for $L$:\n$$r\\sqrt{2} = r + r_{\\mathrm{oct}}$$\nSolving for $r_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ gives:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{oct}} = r\\sqrt{2} - r = r(\\sqrt{2} - 1)$$\nFinally, the required radius ratio is:\n$$\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{oct}}}{r} = \\sqrt{2} - 1$$\n\nDerivation for the Tetrahedral Hole Radius Ratio ($r_{\\mathrm{tet}}/r$)\n\nA tetrahedral hole is defined by $4$ host spheres whose centers form a regular tetrahedron. The distance between the centers of any two of these spheres is the nearest-neighbor distance, $2r$. Thus, the regular tetrahedron has an edge length of $a = 2r$.\n\nTo analyze this geometry, it is convenient to place the $4$ vertices of the tetrahedron at specific alternating corners of a cube. Let the cube have a side length of $s$. We can place the vertices at coordinates $(0,0,0)$, $(s,s,0)$, $(s,0,s)$, and $(0,s,s)$.\n\nThe distance between any two of these vertices is the edge length $a$ of the tetrahedron. Let us calculate the distance between $(0,0,0)$ and $(s,s,0)$:\n$$a = \\sqrt{(s-0)^{2} + (s-0)^{2} + (0-0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{s^{2} + s^{2}} = s\\sqrt{2}$$\nWe know that this edge length is $a = 2r$. Therefore:\n$$s\\sqrt{2} = 2r$$\nSolving for the cube side length $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}} = r\\sqrt{2}$$\nThe center of the tetrahedron (and the cube) is located at $(s/2, s/2, s/2)$. This is the position of the center of the inserted interstitial sphere of radius $r_{\\mathrm{tet}}$.\n\nFor the interstitial sphere to fit perfectly, the distance from its center to the center of any of the $4$ surrounding host spheres must be equal to the sum of their radii, $r + r_{\\mathrm{tet}}$. Let's calculate this distance, $D$, from the center of the tetrahedron at $(s/2, s/2, s/2)$ to one of its vertices, for instance, the one at the origin $(0,0,0)$:\n$$D = \\sqrt{(\\frac{s}{2}-0)^{2} + (\\frac{s}{2}-0)^{2} + (\\frac{s}{2}-0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{3\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis distance must be equal to $r + r_{\\mathrm{tet}}$:\n$$r + r_{\\mathrm{tet}} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $s$ in terms of $r$:\n$$r + r_{\\mathrm{tet}} = \\frac{(r\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$$\nSolving for $r_{\\mathrm{tet}}$:\n$$r_{\\mathrm{tet}} = r\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} - r = r\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} - 1\\right)$$\nThe required radius ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{tet}}}{r} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} - 1$$\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{6} - 2}{2}$.

Rounding to three significant figures gives $16.0 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA^3}$.\n\n3.  **hcp equilibrium volume $V_{0}^{\\mathrm{hcp}}$**:\n    This is the fitted parameter $V_{0}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} = 15.9084 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA^3}$. Rounding to three significant figures gives $15.9 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA^3}$.\n\nThe final results are compiled into a single row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2.00 & 16.0 & 15.9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2473243"}]}
