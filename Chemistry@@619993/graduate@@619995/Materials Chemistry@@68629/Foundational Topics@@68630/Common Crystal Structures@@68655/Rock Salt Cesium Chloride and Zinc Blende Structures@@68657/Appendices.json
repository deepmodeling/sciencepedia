It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing sufficient axioms to derive the required quantities. The descriptions of the crystal structures, while using a specific choice of basis for rock salt that is less common, are crystallographically correct. The problem requires a rigorous derivation from first principles, which is a legitimate and well-defined task. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the number of formula units, $Z$, per conventional unit cell for three binary ionic structures with stoichiometry $\\mathrm{AB}$. According to the provided definition, with stoichiometric coefficients of $1$ for both cation and anion, $Z$ is equal to the number of cations (or anions) contained within one conventional unit cell. The derivation must use only the stated principles.\n\nThe governing principle is that the crystal structure is generated by placing the basis at every point of the specified Bravais lattice. We must count the total number of anions and cations whose coordinates fall within a single conventional unit cell, applying the specified fractional contributions for atoms at shared locations (corners, faces, edges).\n\n**1. Rock Salt (NaCl) Structure**\n\nThe rock salt structure is defined by a face-centered cubic (fcc) Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis: anion at fractional coordinate $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$ and cation at $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of anions per conventional unit cell. The anions are located at the sites of the fcc Bravais lattice, as their basis vector is $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$. An fcc conventional unit cell has lattice points at its $8$ corners and at the center of its $6$ faces. Using the provided counting rule (Axiom 3):\n- Contribution from $8$ corner anions: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n- Contribution from $6$ face-centered anions: $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$.\nThe total number of anions per conventional cell is $N_{A} = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of cations. The cations are located at positions corresponding to each fcc lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$ shifted by the basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$. The set of cation positions is $\\{\\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{b}_{C} | \\mathbf{R} \\in \\text{fcc lattice}\\}$. This forms another fcc lattice, simply displaced from the anion lattice. As such, it must also contain $4$ ions per conventional cell. We verify this by explicit counting.\nWe can identify the cation positions by shifting the anion positions (corners and face centers) by $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$:\n- Shift of corner positions: An atom at a corner, e.g., $(0,0,0)$, is displaced to $(0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,0) = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$. This is the midpoint of an edge. By symmetry of the cubic lattice, all $12$ edge midpoints must be translationally equivalent sites for cations. For example, the edge midpoint $(0,\\frac{1}{2},0)$ is generated from the fcc lattice point $\\mathbf{R} = (-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$ shifted by $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$, plus a lattice translation of $(1,0,0)$: $(-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,0) + (1,0,0) = (1, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)$, which is equivalent to $(0,\\frac{1}{2},0)$. The $12$ edges of the conventional cell are each shared by $4$ cells. Contribution from cations on edges: $12 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3$.\n- Shift of face-center positions: An atom at a face center, e.g., $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, is displaced to $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,0) = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. This position is the body center of the conventional cell and is not shared. Contribution from the body-centered cation: $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nThe total number of cations per conventional cell is $N_{C} = 3 + 1 = 4$.\nSince $N_{A} = N_{C} = 4$, the number of formula units is $Z_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = 4$.\n\n**2. Cesium Chloride (CsCl) Structure**\n\nThe cesium chloride structure is defined by a primitive cubic Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis: anion at $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$ and cation at $\\mathbfb_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nFirst, we count the anions. They are located at the sites of the primitive cubic lattice, which are the $8$ corners of the conventional cubic cell.\n- Contribution from $8$ corner anions: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\nTotal number of anions per conventional cell is $N_{A} = 1$.\n\nNext, we count the cations. Their positions are generated by shifting each lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$ by $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$. For the lattice point at $\\mathbf{R}=(0,0,0)$, the cation is at $(0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. This is the body-center position, which is entirely contained within the cell.\n- Contribution from the body-centered cation: $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nAny other lattice point, e.g., $\\mathbf{R}=(1,0,0)$, generates a cation at $(1,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) = (\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, which is the body center of an adjacent cell. Thus, there is only one cation per conventional cell.\nTotal number of cations per conventional cell is $N_{C} = 1$.\nSince $N_{A} = N_{C} = 1$, the number of formula units is $Z_{\\mathrm{CsCl}} = 1$.\n\n**3. Zinc Blende (ZnS) Structure**\n\nThe zinc blende structure is defined by an fcc Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis: anion at $\\mathbf{b}_{A} = (0,0,0)$ and cation at $\\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\n\nFirst, we count the anions. As in the rock salt case, the anions are on an fcc lattice.\n- Contribution from $8$ corner anions: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n- Contribution from $6$ face-centered anions: $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$.\nTotal number of anions per conventional cell is $N_{A} = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nNext, we count the cations. Their positions are at $\\{\\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{b}_{C} | \\mathbf{R} \\in \\text{fcc lattice}\\}$. The problem states there are $4$ lattice points per conventional fcc cell, with representative fractional coordinates $(0,0,0)$, $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2})$, and $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$. We add the cation basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_{C}$ to each of these to find the locations of the cations within one cell:\n- $\\mathbf{R}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (0,0,0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\n- $\\mathbf{R}_2 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n- $\\mathbf{R}_3 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{3}{4})$.\n- $\\mathbf{R}_4 + \\mathbf{b}_{C} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0) + (\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$.\nAll four of these resulting coordinates have components strictly between $0$ and $1$. Therefore, all four cations lie entirely inside the conventional unit cell. Each contributes $1$ to the count.\nTotal number of cations per conventional cell is $N_{C} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\nSince $N_{A} = N_{C} = 4$, the number of formula units is $Z_{\\mathrm{ZnS}} = 4$.\n\nCombining the results, the values of $Z$ for rock salt, cesium chloride, and zinc blende are $4$, $1$, and $4$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4  1  4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2518413"}, {"introduction": "The arrangement of atoms in a crystal defines the local bonding environment and key physical properties.

We will analyze each of the $3$ structures provided.\n\nFirst, we consider the rock salt (NaCl) structure.\nThe problem states that this structure has a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice. The basis consists of species $A$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{A}=(0,0,0)$ and species $B$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{B}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0,0\\right)$. The difference vector between the basis atoms is $\\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\text{NaCl}} = a(\\mathbf{r}_{B}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}) = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0,0\\right)$.\nThe set of FCC Bravais lattice vectors, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$, is generated by integer linear combinations of the primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=\\frac{a}{2}(0,1,1)$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,0,1)$, and $\\mathbf{a}_{3}=\\frac{a}{2}(1,1,0)$. A general lattice vector $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$ is given by $\\mathbf{R} = n_{1}\\mathbf{a}_{1}+n_{2}\\mathbf{a}_{2}+n_{3}\\mathbf{a}_{3}$ for integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is $\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}(n_{2}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{2})$.\nThe vector connecting an $A$ atom to a $B$ atom is $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\text{NaCl}} + \\mathbf{R} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0,0\\right) + \\frac{a}{2}(n_{2}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{2}) = \\frac{a}{2}(1+n_{2}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{2})$.\nTo find the distance $d_{\\text{NaCl}}$, we must minimize the norm of this vector, which is equivalent to minimizing its norm squared:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R})\\|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2} \\left[ (1+n_{2}+n_{3})^{2} + (n_{1}+n_{3})^{2} + (n_{1}+n_{2})^{2} \\right]\n$$\nLet $I_x = 1+n_2+n_3$, $I_y = n_1+n_3$, and $I_z = n_1+n_2$. Since $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers, $I_x, I_y, I_z$ must also be integers. We seek to minimize the sum of squares $S = I_x^2 + I_y^2 + I_z^2$.\nThe sum $S$ can be zero only if $I_x=I_y=I_z=0$. This requires $n_1+n_3=0$ (so $n_3=-n_1$) and $n_1+n_2=0$ (so $n_2=-n_1$). Substituting these into the expression for $I_x$ gives $1+(-n_1)+(-n_1)=0$, which implies $1-2n_1=0$, or $n_1=1/2$. This is not an integer. Therefore, $I_x, I_y, I_z$ cannot all be zero simultaneously.\nSince $I_x, I_y, I_z$ are integers that are not all zero, the minimum possible value for the sum of their squares $S$ is $1$. This minimum can be achieved if one of the integers is $\\pm 1$ and the other two are $0$. For example, choosing $n_1=n_2=n_3=0$ yields $\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{0}$, which gives $I_x=1$, $I_y=0$, and $I_z=0$. In this case, $S = 1^2+0^2+0^2=1$.\nThe minimum squared distance is therefore $d_{\\text{NaCl}}^{2} = (\\frac{a}{2})^{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{a^{2}}{4}$. The nearest unlike-neighbor distance for the rock salt structure is $d_{\\text{NaCl}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^{2}}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}a$. This corresponds to the vector between the basis atoms within the same conventional cell ($\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{0}$).\n\nSecond, we consider the cesium chloride (CsCl) structure.\nThis structure has a simple cubic (SC) Bravais lattice. The basis is given by species $A$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{A}=(0,0,0)$ and species $B$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{B}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. The basis difference vector is $\\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\text{CsCl}} = a(\\mathbf{r}_{B}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}) = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nThe set of SC Bravais lattice vectors is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{SC}}=\\{a(n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}) \\,|\\, n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\nThe vector connecting an $A$ atom to a $B$ atom is $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\text{CsCl}} + \\mathbf{R} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + a(n_x,n_y,n_z) = a\\left(n_x+\\frac{1}{2}, n_y+\\frac{1}{2}, n_z+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nWe need to minimize the norm squared of this vector:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R})\\|^{2} = a^{2} \\left[ \\left(n_x+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(n_y+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(n_z+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} \\right]\n$$\nTo minimize this expression, we must minimize each term in the sum individually. For any real number $x$, the function $f(n)=(n-x)^2$ for integer $n$ is minimized when $n$ is the integer closest to $x$. Here, we must minimize $(n+1/2)^2$. The integer $n$ is closest to $-1/2$ for $n=0$ and $n=-1$. In both cases, the value is $(\\pm \\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$. This is the minimum possible value for each term.\nBy selecting $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$ (which corresponds to $\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{0}$), we achieve the minimum for all three terms simultaneously.\nThe minimum squared distance is $d_{\\text{CsCl}}^{2} = a^{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{3a^{2}}{4}$.\nThe nearest unlike-neighbor distance for the cesium chloride structure is $d_{\\text{CsCl}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^{2}}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$. This vector connects the corner A atom to the body-center B atom of the conventional cubic cell.\n\nThird, we consider the zinc blende (ZnS) structure.\nThis structure has an FCC Bravais lattice, same as NaCl. The basis is species $A$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{A}=(0,0,0)$ and species $B$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{B}=\\left(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$. The basis difference vector is $\\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\text{ZnS}} = a(\\mathbf{r}_{B}-\\mathbf{r}_{A}) = a\\left(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$.\nA general vector $\\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$ is again $\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}(n_{2}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{2})$.\nThe vector from an $A$ atom to a $B$ atom is $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\text{ZnS}} + \\mathbf{R} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\frac{a}{2}(n_{2}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{3}, n_{1}+n_{2})$.\nTo simplify, we can write this as $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\frac{a}{4} (1+2(n_2+n_3), 1+2(n_1+n_3), 1+2(n_1+n_2))$.\nWe must minimize the norm squared:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{R})\\|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^{2} \\left[ (1+2(n_2+n_3))^{2} + (1+2(n_1+n_3))^{2} + (1+2(n_1+n_2))^{2} \\right]\n$$\nLet $J_x = 1+2(n_2+n_3)$, $J_y = 1+2(n_1+n_3)$, and $J_z = 1+2(n_1+n_2)$. Since $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers, their sums are integers. Therefore, $J_x, J_y, J_z$ are all integers of the form $1+2k$, which means they must be odd integers.\nWe need to minimize the sum of squares $S = J_x^2+J_y^2+J_z^2$. The square of any non-zero integer is at least $1$. The smallest possible magnitude for an odd integer is $1$. Thus, the minimum value for the square of an odd integer is $(\\pm 1)^2 = 1$. The sum $S$ is therefore minimized if we can choose $n_1, n_2, n_3$ such that $|J_x|=|J_y|=|J_z|=1$. The minimum value of $S$ would then be $1^2+1^2+1^2=3$.\nLet's verify if this is possible. We test if we can achieve $J_x=1, J_y=1, J_z=1$. This requires:\n$1+2(n_2+n_3)=1 \\implies n_2+n_3=0$\n$1+2(n_1+n_3)=1 \\implies n_1+n_3=0$\n$1+2(n_1+n_2)=1 \\implies n_1+n_2=0$\nThis system of linear equations has the unique integer solution $n_1=n_2=n_3=0$. This choice corresponds to the lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{0}$.\nThus, the minimum value for the sum of squares is indeed $3$.\nThe minimum squared distance is $d_{\\text{ZnS}}^{2} = (\\frac{a}{4})^{2} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{3a^{2}}{16}$.\nThe nearest unlike-neighbor distance for the zinc blende structure is $d_{\\text{ZnS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^{2}}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$. This represents the distance from an $A$ atom at a lattice point (e.g., a corner) to a $B$ atom in one of the tetrahedral interstitial sites of the FCC cell.\n\nIn summary, the nearest unlike-neighbor distances are $\\frac{1}{2}a$ for rock salt, $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$ for cesium chloride, and $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$ for zinc blende.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}a  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2518412"}, {"introduction": "A theoretical model of a crystal structure is only useful if it can be verified experimentally.

For definiteness, use the following Miller index orderings:\n- cesium chloride: $(100)$, $(110)$, $(111)$, $(200)$, $(210)$,\n- rock salt: $(111)$, $(200)$, $(220)$, $(311)$, $(222)$.\nExpress each $d$ as a symbolic function of $a$.\n\n(c) Briefly explain how the two ordered sets of $d$-spacings from part (b) can be used to distinguish these phases in powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), emphasizing the role of the selection rules and the integer sequences formed by $a^{2}/d^{2}$.\n\nAnswer format: Provide a single row matrix containing the $10$ symbolic $d$-spacings in the order specified in part (b), with no units, as functions of $a$. Do not round.", "solution": "We begin with the standard kinematic description of diffraction from a periodic crystal. Bragg’s law $2 d \\sin\\theta = n \\lambda$ relates the interplanar spacing $d$ and the diffraction angle $\\theta$, and for a cubic lattice the spacing of planes with Miller indices $(hkl)$ is\n$$\nd_{hkl} \\;=\\; \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}}.\n$$\nThe presence or absence of a reflection is governed by the structure factor\n$$\nF(hkl) \\;=\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\text{basis}}} f_{j} \\exp\\!\\big(2\\pi i \\,(h x_{j} + k y_{j} + l z_{j})\\big),\n$$\npossibly multiplied by the lattice-centering sum that encodes the Bravais lattice centering. A reflection is systematically absent if $F(hkl)=0$ due to destructive interference from symmetry.\n\nPart (a): selection rules.\n\nCesium chloride structure. This structure can be described as a primitive (simple) cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$. The structure factor is\n$$\nF_{\\text{CsCl}}(hkl) \\;=\\; f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\exp\\!\\big(2\\pi i \\cdot 0\\big) + f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\exp\\!\\Big(2\\pi i \\,\\Big(h \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} + k \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} + l \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Big)\\Big)\n\\;=\\; f_{\\mathrm{A}} + f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\exp\\!\\big(i \\pi (h+k+l)\\big).\n$$\nSince $\\exp(i \\pi (h+k+l)) = (-1)^{h+k+l}$, one has\n$$\nF_{\\text{CsCl}}(hkl) \\;=\\; f_{\\mathrm{A}} + f_{\\mathrm{B}}\\,(-1)^{h+k+l}.\n$$\nFor X-rays with $f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\neq f_{\\mathrm{B}}$, $F_{\\text{CsCl}}(hkl) \\neq 0$ for both parities of $h+k+l$, although the amplitude differs: when $h+k+l$ is even, $F_{\\text{CsCl}} = f_{\\mathrm{A}} + f_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and when $h+k+l$ is odd, $F_{\\text{CsCl}} = f_{\\mathrm{A}} - f_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Therefore, there are no systematic absences beyond those of the primitive cubic lattice (which has none); all $(hkl)$ are allowed for X-rays, with intensities modulated by parity.\n\nRock salt structure. This structure is a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},0,0\\right)$. The total structure factor factorizes into a centering sum $C(hkl)$ from the FCC lattice translations and a basis sum $B(hkl)$:\n$$\nF_{\\text{NaCl}}(hkl) \\;=\\; C(hkl)\\,B(hkl).\n$$\nFor the FCC lattice, the centering sum over the four lattice points $(0,0,0)$, $\\left(0,\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$, $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},0,\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$, $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},0\\right)$ yields\n$$\nC(hkl) \\;=\\; 1 + \\exp\\!\\big(i\\pi (k+l)\\big) + \\exp\\!\\big(i\\pi (h+l)\\big) + \\exp\\!\\big(i\\pi (h+k)\\big).\n$$\nElementary evaluation shows $C(hkl) = 4$ if $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd, and $C(hkl) = 0$ otherwise. This is the familiar FCC selection rule.\n\nThe two-atom basis contributes\n$$\nB(hkl) \\;=\\; f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\exp\\!\\big(2\\pi i \\cdot 0\\big) + f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\exp\\!\\Big(2\\pi i \\,\\Big(h \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} + k \\cdot 0 + l \\cdot 0\\Big)\\Big) \\;=\\; f_{\\mathrm{A}} + f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\exp(i\\pi h) \\;=\\; f_{\\mathrm{A}} + f_{\\mathrm{B}} (-1)^{h}.\n$$\nOn the allowed FCC sets (all even or all odd), $h$ is even in the all-even class and odd in the all-odd class. Thus,\n- if $h,k,l$ are all even: $B = f_{\\mathrm{A}} + f_{\\mathrm{B}}$,\n- if $h,k,l$ are all odd: $B = f_{\\mathrm{A}} - f_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\nWith $f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\neq f_{\\mathrm{B}}$, both classes yield nonzero intensity. Therefore, the rock salt structure exhibits the FCC selection rule: reflections occur only when $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd.\n\nPart (b): first five allowed $d$-spacings for each structure.\n\nBecause $d_{hkl} = a/\\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}$ in any cubic lattice, ordering by increasing $1/d$ is equivalent to ordering by increasing $S \\equiv h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}$ within the allowed set.\n\nCesium chloride (primitive cubic with a two-atom basis, no absences for X-rays). The smallest five values of $S$ over all integer triplets $(h,k,l)$ (excluding $(0,0,0)$) are\n$$\nS = 1 \\text{ for } (100),\\quad S = 2 \\text{ for } (110),\\quad S = 3 \\text{ for } (111),\\quad S = 4 \\text{ for } (200),\\quad S = 5 \\text{ for } (210).\n$$\nHence\n$$\nd_{100} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1}} = a,\\quad\nd_{110} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad\nd_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}},\\quad\nd_{200} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{a}{2},\\quad\nd_{210} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{5}}.\n$$\n\nRock salt (FCC selection rule: $h,k,l$ all even or all odd). The smallest five allowed $S$ values are\n$$\nS = 3 \\text{ for } (111),\\quad S = 4 \\text{ for } (200),\\quad S = 8 \\text{ for } (220),\\quad S = 11 \\text{ for } (311),\\quad S = 12 \\text{ for } (222).\n$$\nThus\n$$\nd_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}},\\quad\nd_{200} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{a}{2},\\quad\nd_{220} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}},\\quad\nd_{311} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{11}},\\quad\nd_{222} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\nPart (c): phase identification from $d$-spacings.\n\nIn powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the measured $2\\theta$ positions map to $d$-spacings via Bragg’s law, and for cubic phases the sequence of $a^{2}/d^{2} = h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}$ over the allowed reflections yields a characteristic integer sequence. For the cesium chloride structure (primitive cubic with a two-atom basis), all $(hkl)$ are allowed, giving the initial sequence $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\dots$ and hence the first peaks at $(100)$ and $(110)$. In contrast, the rock salt structure (face-centered cubic with a two-atom basis) enforces the FCC extinction rule, producing the initial sequence $3, 4, 8, 11, 12, \\dots$ and the first peak at $(111)$; notably, $(100)$ and $(110)$ are absent. Therefore, the presence of a strong $(100)$ peak at the largest $d$ (smallest $2\\theta$) is diagnostic of the cesium chloride structure, whereas its absence together with the $(111)$ onset is diagnostic of the rock salt structure. Even when both classes (all even and all odd) are present, the relative intensities differ between the two structures through $F(hkl)$, but the most robust fingerprint for phase identification is the allowed-index sequence, i.e., the pattern of absences and the corresponding integer values of $a^{2}/d^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\na  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}  \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{5}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}  \\frac{a}{2}  \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{11}}  \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{3}}\n\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2518389"}]}
