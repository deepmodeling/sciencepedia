All required data, including life cycle inventory, characterization factors, normalization factors, and weighting factors, are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. The problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe calculation is performed in three stages: characterization, normalization, and weighting.\n\nFirst, we perform the characterization step to calculate the midpoint impact scores for each of the three categories: Global Warming Potential ($GWP_{100}$), Terrestrial Acidification ($TA$), and Freshwater Eutrophication ($FE$). The characterized score for a category $c$, denoted $I_c$, is the sum over all emitted substances $i$ of the product of the mass of the emission, $m_i$, and its substance-specific characterization factor, $CF_{c,i}$.\n$$I_c = \\sum_{i} m_i \\cdot CF_{c,i}$$\nThe given emissions for a functional unit of 1000 kg of polymer are:\n$m_{\\text{CO}_2} = 1000$ kg\n$m_{\\text{CH}_4} = 5$ kg\n$m_{\\text{NO}_x} = 2$ kg\n$m_{\\text{SO}_2} = 1$ kg\n\nThe characterized score for Global Warming Potential ($I_{GWP}$) is calculated using the GWP100 characterization factors: $CF_{GWP, \\text{CO}_2} = 1$, $CF_{GWP, \\text{CH}_4} = 28$.\n$$I_{GWP} = (m_{\\text{CO}_2} \\cdot CF_{GWP, \\text{CO}_2}) + (m_{\\text{CH}_4} \\cdot CF_{GWP, \\text{CH}_4})$$\n$$I_{GWP} = (1000 \\text{ kg} \\cdot 1) + (5 \\text{ kg} \\cdot 28) = 1000 + 140 = 1140\\ \\text{kg CO}_2\\text{-equivalent}$$\nThe contribution from $\\text{CO}_2$ is $1000$ kg $\\text{CO}_2$-eq, and from $\\text{CH}_4$ is $140$ kg $\\text{CO}_2$-eq.

The normalized score for each category, $N_c$, is obtained by dividing the characterized score $I_c$ by the corresponding normalization factor $NF_c$.\n$$N_c = \\frac{I_c}{NF_c}$$\nThe given normalization factors are $NF_{GWP} = 1.00 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{kg CO}_2\\text{-eq}$, $NF_{TA} = 50\\ \\text{kg SO}_2\\text{-eq}$, and $NF_{FE} = 10\\ \\text{kg PO}_4^{3-}\\text{-eq}$.\nThe resulting dimensionless normalized scores are:\n$$N_{GWP} = \\frac{1140}{1.00 \\times 10^4} = 0.1140$$\n$$N_{TA} = \\frac{2.40}{50} = 0.0480$$\n$$N_{FE} = \\frac{0.26}{10} = 0.0260$$\n\nThird, we perform weighting. The single-score indicator $S$ is the weighted sum of the normalized scores, where $WF_c$ is the weighting factor for category $c$.\n$$S = \\sum_{c} N_c \\cdot WF_c$$\nThe given weighting factors are $WF_{GWP} = 0.50$, $WF_{TA} = 0.30$, and $WF_{FE} = 0.20$. The sum of these weights is $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 1.00$.\nThe single-score $S$ is calculated as:\n$$S = (N_{GWP} \\cdot WF_{GWP}) + (N_{TA} \\cdot WF_{TA}) + (N_{FE} \\cdot WF_{FE})$$\n$$S = (0.1140 \\cdot 0.50) + (0.0480 \\cdot 0.30) + (0.0260 \\cdot 0.20)$$\n$$S = 0.05700 + 0.01440 + 0.00520$$\n$$S = 0.07660$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on objective, standard principles of materials chemistry and process engineering. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Process Mass Intensity (PMI) and then calculate its change under specified conditions.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{product}}$ be the mass of the final saleable product.\nThe inputs crossing the gate-to-gate system boundary are the raw materials. These consist of the reagents and any fresh solvent required to make up for losses. Recycled solvent operates within the system boundary and is not considered a new input.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{total\\_input}}$ be the total mass of all inputs crossing the boundary. This is given by:\n$$m_{\\text{total\\_input}} = m_{\\text{reagents}} + m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}$$\nwhere $m_{\\text{reagents}}$ is the mass of reagents and $m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}$ is the mass of fresh make-up solvent.\n\nBy definition, the PMI is:\n$$PMI = \\frac{m_{\\text{total\\_input}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{reagents}} + m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}}{m_{\\text{product}}}$$\nThis can be separated into two terms:\n$$PMI = \\frac{m_{\\text{reagents}}}{m_{\\text{product}}} + \\frac{m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}}{m_{\\text{product}}}$$\n\nThe first term is given as the reagent-to-product mass ratio, $R$:\n$$PMI = R + \\frac{m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}}{m_{\\text{product}}}$$\n\nNext, we establish the mass balance for the solvent loop at steady state. Let $m_{\\text{solvent, in}}$ be the total mass of solvent that enters the reactor. This total mass is the sum of fresh solvent and recycled solvent.\n$$m_{\\text{solvent, in}} = m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}} + m_{\\text{solvent, recycled}}$$\n\nThe solvent recovery fraction, $f$, is the fraction of the total solvent entering the reactor that is recovered and recycled. Therefore, the mass of recycled solvent is:\n$$m_{\\text{solvent, recycled}} = f \\cdot m_{\\text{solvent, in}}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the solvent mass balance equation:\n$$m_{\\text{solvent, in}} = m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}} + f \\cdot m_{\\text{solvent, in}}$$\n\nSolving for the fresh solvent mass, $m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}$, which represents the solvent lost in the process that must be replenished from outside the system boundary:\n$$m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}} = m_{\\text{solvent, in}} - f \\cdot m_{\\text{solvent, in}} = m_{\\text{solvent, in}} (1 - f)$$\n\nNow, we introduce the solvent-to-product mass ratio, $S \\equiv m_{\\text{solvent,in}}/m_{\\text{product}}$. We can express $m_{\\text{solvent, in}}$ in terms of $S$ and $m_{\\text{product}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{solvent, in}} = S \\cdot m_{\\text{product}}$$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $m_{\\text{solvent, in}}$ into the equation for $m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}} = (S \\cdot m_{\\text{product}})(1 - f)$$\n\nFinally, substitute this expression for $m_{\\text{solvent, fresh}}$ back into the equation for PMI:\n$$PMI = R + \\frac{(S \\cdot m_{\\text{product}})(1 - f)}{m_{\\text{product}}}$$\nThe $m_{\\text{product}}$ terms cancel, yielding the final symbolic expression for PMI:\n$$PMI = R + S(1 - f)$$\nThis expression is derived from the required first principles and relates PMI to the given parameters $R$, $S$, and $f$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are asked to compute the absolute decrease in PMI when the solvent recovery fraction is improved from an initial value $f_1 = 0.70$ to a final value $f_2 = 0.95$. The solvent-to-product ratio is constant at $S=10$, and $R$ is also constant.\n\nLet $PMI_1$ be the initial PMI with recovery fraction $f_1$:\n$$PMI_1 = R + S(1 - f_1)$$\n\nLet $PMI_2$ be the final PMI with recovery fraction $f_2$:\n$$PMI_2 = R + S(1 - f_2)$$\n\nThe absolute decrease in PMI, denoted as $\\Delta PMI$, is the difference $PMI_1 - PMI_2$:\n$$\\Delta PMI = PMI_1 - PMI_2 = [R + S(1 - f_1)] - [R + S(1 - f_2)]$$\n$$\\Delta PMI = R + S - Sf_1 - R - S + Sf_2$$\n$$\\Delta PMI = S(f_2 - f_1)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $S=10$, $f_1 = 0.70$, and $f_2 = 0.95$.\n$$\\Delta PMI = 10 \\cdot (0.95 - 0.70)$$\n$$\\Delta PMI = 10 \\cdot (0.25)$$\n$$\\Delta PMI = 2.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the result is $2.50$.\nThe improvement in solvent recovery from $f=0.70$ to $f=0.95$ results in an absolute decrease in the Process Mass Intensity of $2.50$.
