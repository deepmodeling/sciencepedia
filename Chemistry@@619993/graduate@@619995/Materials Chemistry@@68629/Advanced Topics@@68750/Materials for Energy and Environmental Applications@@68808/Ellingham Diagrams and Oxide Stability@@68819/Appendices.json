The second term is a small positive constant.\nAs $T$ increases, $1/T$ decreases, so the large negative term becomes less negative (i.e., increases). The overall exponent increases, and thus $p_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ increases.\nThe result $F > 1$ is therefore correct.

This constitutes a \"kink\" in the curve.\n\nThe magnitude of this kink, $\\kappa$, is defined as:\n$$ \\kappa \\equiv \\left|\\left.\\frac{d\\,\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{dT}\\right|_{T=T_{t}^{+}} - \\left.\\frac{d\\,\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{dT}\\right|_{T=T_{t}^{-}}\\right| $$\nSubstituting our result for the difference in slopes:\n$$ \\kappa = |-\\Delta S_{tr}| $$\nAs established, $\\Delta S_{tr}$ is positive, so $|\\!-\\Delta S_{tr}| = \\Delta S_{tr}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\kappa = \\Delta S_{tr} $$\nThe problem provides the value $\\Delta S_{tr} = 6.80\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$. The temperature $T_t = 960\\,\\text{K}$ is extraneous information for the calculation of $\\kappa$, but it correctly locates the kink on the temperature axis.\nThe numerical value for the kink magnitude is therefore:\n$$ \\kappa = 6.80\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} $$\nThis value is already expressed to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{6.80} $$", "id": "2485729"}]}
