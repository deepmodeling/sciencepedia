The intensity of light that is transmitted through the film, denoted as $I_T$, is the intensity evaluated at $x=d$:\n$$I_T = I(d) = I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha d)$$\n\nThe intensity of light absorbed by the film, $I_A$, is the difference between the incident intensity and the transmitted intensity. This is because reflection and scattering are stated to be negligible.\n$$I_A = I_0 - I_T$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_T$, we get:\n$$I_A = I_0 - I_0 \\exp(-\\alpha d) = I_0 (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha d))$$\n\nThe problem requires that $90\\%$ of the incident light is absorbed.

However, it specifies that the semiconductor is non-degenerate and operates at a temperature $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$. For such a system, where carriers obey Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, the diffusion coefficient $D$ is related to the carrier mobility $\\mu$ through the Einstein relation:\n$$D = \\mu \\frac{k_B T}{q}$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\ K^{-1}}$), $T$ is the absolute temperature in kelvin, and $q$ is the elementary charge ($q \\approx 1.6021766 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$).

For a photovoltaic cell to operate efficiently, photogenerated minority carriers must be collected at the $p$-$n$ junction before they recombine. Carriers are collected when they reach the space-charge region of the junction, where a strong electric field sweeps them across. Carriers generated in the quasi-neutral bulk of the absorber must travel by diffusion to reach this region. The distance they can travel is characterized by $L$. If the absorber thickness, $W$, is much greater than the diffusion length ($W \\gg L$), carriers generated deep within the absorber (at a distance $> L$ from the junction) will almost certainly recombine before they can be collected. This event constitutes a loss of photocurrent and reduces the quantum efficiency of the device. Therefore, for efficient carrier collection, the absorber thickness $W$ should be on the order of, or ideally less than, the minority-carrier diffusion length ($W \\lesssim L$). This ensures a high probability of collection for the majority of carriers generated by light absorption throughout the material's volume. There is a design trade-off, as a thicker absorber absorbs more light, but a thinner absorber ensures better carrier collection. The optimal thickness is thus strongly constrained by the material's diffusion length.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16.1}$$", "id": "2510090"}, {"introduction": "The open-circuit voltage ($V_{oc}$) is a primary determinant of a solar cell's power output, representing the maximum potential difference the device can generate.
