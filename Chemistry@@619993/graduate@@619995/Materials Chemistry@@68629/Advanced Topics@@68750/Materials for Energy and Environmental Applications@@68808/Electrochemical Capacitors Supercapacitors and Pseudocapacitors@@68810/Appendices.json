A critical analysis of the underlying assumptions is also demanded. The approach must be rigorous and begin from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between total capacitance, $C$, areal capacitance, $c_a$, and gravimetric capacitance, $C_g$. The definition of capacitance is given as the ratio of an infinitesimal change in charge, $dQ$, to the corresponding infinitesimal change in electric potential, $dV$:\n$$C = \\frac{dQ}{dV}$$\nThis total capacitance $C$ arises from charge storage over the entire electrochemically active surface of the electrode material. Let the mass of the electrode material be $m$.\n\nWe are given an areal differential capacitance, $c_a$, which is the capacitance per unit of surface area. It is defined as:\n$$c_a = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dQ}{dV} = \\frac{C}{A}$$\nwhere $A$ is the total electrochemically accessible surface area of the electrode. The problem states to assume $c_a$ is constant with potential, which simplifies the relationship to $C = c_a \\times A$.\n\nThe gravimetric capacitance, $C_g$, is defined as the total capacitance per unit mass of the electrode material:\n$$C_g = \\frac{C}{m}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C$ into the definition of $C_g$, we obtain:\n$$C_g = \\frac{c_a \\times A}{m}$$\nThe total accessible area $A$ is related to the mass $m$ through the specific surface area, $S_{active}$, which is the accessible area per unit mass.\n$$S_{active} = \\frac{A}{m}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C_g$, the mass $m$ cancels out, yielding the desired expression:\n$$C_g = c_a \\times S_{active}$$\nThis derivation hinges on one central and critical assumption: we must relate the specific surface area accessible to electrolyte ions, $S_{active}$, to the given Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area, $S$. The problem provides $S = 2000\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\ g^{-1}}$. For the purpose of this calculation, we must make the simplifying—and often inaccurate—assumption that the entire BET surface is electrochemically accessible to the solvated ions of the electrolyte.\n**Assumption**: $S_{active} = S$.\nUnder this assumption, the final expression for the theoretical gravimetric capacitance is:\n$$C_g = c_a \\times S$$\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $C_g$. The given parameters are:\n$$S = 2000\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\ g^{-1}}$$\n$$c_a = 20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F\\ cm^{-2}}$$\nTo perform the calculation, the units must be made consistent. We will convert the areal capacitance $c_a$ into units of $\\mathrm{F\\ m^{-2}}$ to match the units of $S$.\nWe know that $1\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, which implies $1\\ \\mathrm{cm^2} = (10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2} = 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$.\nAlso, $1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F}$.\nTherefore, the conversion for $c_a$ is:\n$$c_a = 20\\ \\frac{\\mu F}{\\mathrm{cm^2}} = 20 \\times \\frac{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F}}{10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} = 20 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m^2}} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{F\\ m^{-2}}$$\nAssuming the given values $2000$ and $20$ are specified to three significant figures (i.e., $2.00 \\times 10^3$ and $20.0$), we have $c_a = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{F\\ m^{-2}}$.\nNow we can calculate $C_g$:\n$$C_g = (0.200\\ \\mathrm{F\\ m^{-2}}) \\times (2000\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\ g^{-1}}) = 400\\ \\mathrm{F\\ g^{-1}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $400$. In scientific notation, this is $4.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{F\\ g^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, a discussion of the physical limitations and approximations of this model is required.\n$1$. **Accessibility of BET Area to Solvated Ions**: The most significant approximation is equating the electrochemically active surface area ($S_{active}$) with the BET surface area ($S$). The BET method measures the physical adsorption of small gas molecules (e.g., $N_2$, with a kinetic diameter of approximately $0.364\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) into the porous structure of the material. Electrolyte ions, however, are significantly larger and are surrounded by a solvation shell, increasing their effective (solvodynamic) radius. For instance, a hydrated sodium ion, $\\mathrm{Na}^+\\text{(aq)}$, has a radius of approximately $0.358\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. Consequently, many of the smaller micropores that contribute to the high BET surface area are inaccessible to these larger solvated ions. Thus, $S_{active}  S$, and our calculated value of $C_g$ represents a theoretical upper limit that is rarely achieved in practice.\n$2$. **Potential-Independence of Areal Capacitance**: The problem specifies the assumption of a constant areal capacitance, $c_a = 20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F\\ cm^{-2}}$. In reality, for a given electrode-electrolyte interface, $c_a$ is a function of the electrode potential, $V$. The differential capacitance curve, $c_a(V)$, for carbon materials typically exhibits a minimum near the potential of zero charge (PZC) and increases away from the PZC. The provided value is merely a representative average or a value at a specific potential. Using this single value for a calculation that might span a finite potential window is an oversimplification.\n$3$. **Influence of Interfacial Structure and Electrolyte**: The value of $c_a$ is not an intrinsic property of the carbon material alone. It is strongly dependent on the properties of the electrolyte, including ion size, charge, and concentration, as well as the solvent. The simplified Helmholtz parallel-plate model, which would predict a constant capacitance, fails to capture the complexity of the electrical double layer. More sophisticated models like the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model show that the total capacitance is a series combination of a compact layer capacitance (Stern layer) and a diffuse layer capacitance, the latter being dependent on electrolyte concentration and potential. The value of $20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu F\\ cm^{-2}}$ is a typical empirical result for carbon in an aqueous electrolyte but obscures these underlying physical dependencies.\n$4$. **Absence of Pseudocapacitance**: The problem is restricted to a potential region where only electric double-layer capacitance (EDLC) occurs. However, many high-surface-area carbons possess surface functional groups (e.g., quinone, carboxyl) that can undergo Faradaic redox reactions, contributing pseudocapacitance. If such reactions were present, the measured capacitance would be higher than the purely non-Faradaic EDLC contribution estimated here. This calculation therefore provides a baseline value for the EDLC component only.\n\nIn conclusion, the calculation provides a useful first-order estimate, but its result must be interpreted as a theoretical maximum under idealized conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00 \\times 10^2}$$", "id": "2483815"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting experimental data is a cornerstone of materials science.

Calculation of Device Capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{device}}$\n\nThe capacitance of a capacitor is defined by the relation $C = Q/\\Delta V$, where $Q$ is the charge stored or discharged and $\\Delta V$ is the corresponding change in potential across the capacitor's dielectric or double layer.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total charge, $Q$, that is discharged during the linear portion of the GCD curve. Since the discharge current, $I$, is constant, the integral $Q = \\int I\\,dt$ simplifies to a simple product:\n$$Q = I \\times \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Q = 0.150\\ \\mathrm{A} \\times 12.80\\ \\mathrm{s} = 1.92\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the change in voltage, $\\Delta V_C$, that occurs across the purely capacitive component of the device. The measured device voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{device}}$, includes both the voltage across the capacitor, $V_C$, and the voltage drop across the device's a-priori internal resistance (ESR), $V_{IR}$. The problem provides the instantaneous ohmic drop, $\\Delta V_{IR}$, which occurs at the moment of current reversal from charge to discharge. This drop is due to the internal resistance and should not be included in the voltage change associated with energy stored capacitively.\n\nThe linear discharge begins immediately after this drop, from an initial voltage of $V_{\\max} - \\Delta V_{IR}$, and proceeds down to $V_{\\min}$. Therefore, the voltage change across the capacitive element is:\n$$\\Delta V_C = (V_{\\max} - \\Delta V_{IR}) - V_{\\min}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta V_C = (1.60\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.080\\ \\mathrm{V}) - 0.00\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1.52\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNow, the device capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{device}}$, can be calculated using the definition of capacitance:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{device}} = \\frac{Q}{\\Delta V_C} = \\frac{I \\times \\Delta t}{(V_{\\max} - \\Delta V_{IR}) - V_{\\min}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{device}} = \\frac{1.92\\ \\mathrm{C}}{1.52\\ \\mathrm{V}} \\approx 1.263157...\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\nAs per the problem instruction, this result must be rounded to four significant figures, giving:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{device}} = 1.263\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\n\n2.

It describes a standard calculation in the field of electrochemical energy storage, using realistic parameters for a high-performance electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The assumptions are clearly stated and appropriate for a first-principles-based analysis. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the gravimetric energy density of an electrochemical capacitor and then compute its value relative to a lithium-ion battery.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the energy $U$ stored in a capacitor from fundamental principles. The differential work $dU$ required to move an infinitesimal charge $dq$ across a potential difference $V$ is given by the electrostatic relationship:\n$$dU = V dq$$\nThe definition of capacitance $C$ is the ratio of stored charge $Q$ to the potential difference $V$, which is $C = \\frac{Q}{V}$. For a capacitor with a voltage-independent capacitance as assumed in the problem, we can write $Q = CV$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $V$ gives $dq = C dV$. Substituting this into the work expression, we obtain:\n$$dU = C V dV$$\nTo find the total energy stored when charging the capacitor from an initial voltage of $0$ to a final cell voltage $V_{cell}$, we must integrate this differential expression:\n$$U = \\int_0^{V_{cell}} C V dV$$\nGiven that the capacitance $C$ is constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$U = C \\int_0^{V_{cell}} V dV = C \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} V^2 \\right]_0^{V_{cell}} = \\frac{1}{2} C V_{cell}^2$$\nGravimetric energy density, $E_g$, is defined as the stored energy per unit mass, $m$. For the full device, the gravimetric energy density $E_{g,dev}$ is based on the total device capacitance $C_{dev}$, the maximum device voltage $V_{\\max}$, and the total mass of the active material of both electrodes $m_{dev}$:\n$$E_{g,dev} = \\frac{U}{m_{dev}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} C_{dev} V_{\\max}^2}{m_{dev}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{C_{dev}}{m_{dev}} \\right) V_{\\max}^2$$\nThe term in parentheses is, by definition, the device-level gravimetric capacitance, $C_{g,dev}$. This yields the requested functional relationship:\n$$E_{g,dev} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{g,dev} V_{\\max}^2$$\nNext, we must relate the device-level gravimetric capacitance $C_{g,dev}$ to the given single-electrode gravimetric capacitance $C_{g,e}$. A symmetric two-electrode device is electrically equivalent to two identical capacitors, each with capacitance $C_e$, connected in series. The total capacitance of the device, $C_{dev}$, is therefore given by the formula for capacitors in series:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_{dev}} = \\frac{1}{C_e} + \\frac{1}{C_e} = \\frac{2}{C_e}$$\nThis gives the relationship for the absolute capacitances: $C_{dev} = \\frac{C_e}{2}$.\n\nThe problem specifies how gravimetric quantities are defined. The single-electrode gravimetric capacitance $C_{g,e}$ is normalized by the mass of a single electrode, $m_e$, such that $C_{g,e} = \\frac{C_e}{m_e}$. The device-level gravimetric capacitance $C_{g,dev}$ is normalized by the total mass of both electrodes, $m_{dev}$. For a symmetric device, $m_{dev} = 2m_e$. The definition is $C_{g,dev} = \\frac{C_{dev}}{m_{dev}}$.\nBy substituting the established relationships for absolute capacitance and mass, we can derive the connection between the gravimetric capacitances:\n$$C_{g,dev} = \\frac{C_{dev}}{m_{dev}} = \\frac{C_e / 2}{2 m_e} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{C_e}{m_e}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $C_{g,e}$ into this expression gives the final, critical relationship:\n$$C_{g,dev} = \\frac{1}{4} C_{g,e}$$\nThis factor of $4$ is fundamental for symmetric two-electrode systems where device-level gravimetric parameters are normalized by the total mass of both electrodes.\n\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculation.
