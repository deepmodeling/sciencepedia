The hole energy dispersion is $E_{h}(k) = E_{v0} - E_{v}(k)$.

Therefore, the exponential term is constant. The entire pre-exponential term, apart from the effective masses, is also constant. The dependence of $n_{i}$ on the effective masses is thus given by:\n$$\nn_{i} \\propto (m_{e}^{\\ast}m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/4}\n$$\nWe must compare the product $m_{e}^{\\ast}m_{h}^{\\ast}$ for the two cases.\n\nCase 1 (calculated from problem data):\n$m_{e}^{\\ast} \\approx 4.76\\,m_{e}$\n$m_{h}^{\\ast} \\approx 2.38\\,m_{e}$\nProduct: $m_{e}^{\\ast}m_{h}^{\\ast} \\approx (4.76 \\times 2.38) m_{e}^{2} \\approx 11.33\\,m_{e}^{2}$\n\nCase 2 (hypothetical case):\n$m_{e}^{\\ast} = 0.10\\,m_{e}$\n$m_{h}^{\\ast} = 0.10\\,m_{e}$\nProduct: $m_{e}^{\\ast}m_{h}^{\\ast} = (0.10 \\times 0.10) m_{e}^{2} = 0.01\\,m_{e}^{2}$\n\nThe product of effective masses for the material described in the problem ($11.33\\,m_{e}^{2}$) is substantially larger than the product for the hypothetical case ($0.01\\,m_{e}^{2}$). Since $n_{i}$ increases with $(m_{e}^{\\ast}m_{h}^{\\ast})^{3/4}$, a larger product of effective masses leads to a higher intrinsic carrier concentration. Specifically, heavier charge carriers correspond to a higher density of available states near the band edges, which, at a given temperature, allows for a greater population of thermally excited electron-hole pairs.\n\nTherefore, the calculated effective masses, being significantly larger, imply a much higher intrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}$ compared to the hypothetical case with smaller masses, given that all other parameters ($E_{g}$, $T$) are identical.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.76 & 2.38 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2499049"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate efficiency of a solar cell is limited by the lifetime of its photogenerated electrons and holes before they are lost to recombination.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total effective lifetime of excess carriers by considering two parallel recombination channels: Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination through defects and band-to-band radiative recombination. The total recombination rate is the sum of the individual rates, $U_{\\mathrm{total}} = U_{\\mathrm{SRH}} + U_{\\mathrm{rad}}$.

The total carrier concentrations are $n = n_{0} + \\Delta n$ and $p = p_{0} + \\Delta p$, where $n_0$ and $p_0$ are the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nWe analyze this expression under the specified conditions for a p-type semiconductor in low injection:\n1.  $p_{0} \\approx N_{A}$ and $n_{0} = n_{i}^{2}/p_{0} \\ll p_{0}$.\n2.

Therefore, we set $J_{\\mathrm{TL}}(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}) = J_{\\mathrm{TF}}(V_{\\mathrm{TFL}})$.\n$$C_{1} V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}^{m_{1}} = C_{2} V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}^{2}$$\nAssuming $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}^{2}$:\n$$C_{1} V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}^{m_{1}-2} = C_{2}$$\nSolving for $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}$ yields:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\left(\\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m_{1}-2}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\left(\\frac{J_{2}/V_{2}^{2}}{J_{1}/V_{1}^{m_{1}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m_{1}-2}} = \\left(\\frac{J_{2} V_{1}^{m_{1}}}{J_{1} V_{2}^{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m_{1}-2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided: $J_{1} = 1.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{A}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $V_{1} = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $m_{1} = 3.2$, $J_{2} = 6.00 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{A}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, and $V_{2} = 2.00\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\left(\\frac{(6.00 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (0.50)^{3.2}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{2}) \\times (2.00)^{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3.2-2.0}} = \\left(\\frac{6000 \\times 0.10865}{100 \\times 4}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1.2}} = \\left(\\frac{651.9}{400}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1.2}} \\approx (1.62975)^{\\frac{5}{6}} \\approx 1.5022\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe first part of the problem is complete. Now we must derive and evaluate the trap density, $N_{t}$.\n\nThe trap-filled limit voltage is the potential required to inject a total charge equal to the charge needed to fill all traps in the volume of the device. Assuming a uniform trap distribution, the total trap charge is $Q_{t} = e N_{t} A L$, where $A$ is the device area and $L$ is the perovskite layer thickness. Under the SCLC condition, the injected charge density is not uniform, but we can derive the relationship using Poisson's equation for the electric potential.\nIn one dimension, Poisson's equation is:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon}$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{r}$ is the permittivity of the material. At the trap-filled limit, the space charge density $\\rho$ is approximately constant and equal to the charge density of all filled traps, so $\\rho \\approx eN_{t}$. We integrate from the injecting contact at $x=0$ to a position $x$:\n$$E(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{eN_{t}}{\\varepsilon} dx' = \\frac{eN_{t}}{\\varepsilon}x$$\nHere we have used the boundary condition for an ideal ohmic contact, $E(0) = 0$. The potential difference across the layer of thickness $L$ is found by integrating the electric field:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\int_{0}^{L} E(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{eN_{t}}{\\varepsilon}x dx = \\frac{eN_{t}}{\\varepsilon} \\left[\\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right]_{0}^{L}$$\nThis yields the fundamental relation:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} = \\frac{e N_{t} L^{2}}{2 \\varepsilon} = \\frac{e N_{t} L^{2}}{2 \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r}}$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for the trap density $N_{t}$:\n$$N_{t} = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon_{r} V_{\\mathrm{TFL}}}{e L^{2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the known values: $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $\\varepsilon_{r} = 24.0$, $V_{\\mathrm{TFL}} \\approx 1.5022\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$, and $L = 3.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$N_{t} = \\frac{2 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times 24.0 \\times 1.5022}{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{-7})^{2}}$$\n$$N_{t} = \\frac{6.384 \\times 10^{-10}}{1.4418 \\times 10^{-32}} \\approx 4.4279 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.
