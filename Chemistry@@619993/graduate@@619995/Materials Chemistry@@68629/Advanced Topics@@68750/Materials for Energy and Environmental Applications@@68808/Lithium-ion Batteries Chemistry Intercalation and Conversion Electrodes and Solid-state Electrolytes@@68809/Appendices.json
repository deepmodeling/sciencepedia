It describes a standard Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) experiment and requests the derivation and application of the corresponding analytical model under specified simplifying assumptions. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental process is one-dimensional diffusion of lithium within the electrode, governed by Fick's second law:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c(x, t)}{\\partial t} = \\tilde{D} \\frac{\\partial^2 c(x, t)}{\\partial x^2} $$\nwhere $c(x, t)$ is the lithium concentration at position $x$ and time $t$, and $\\tilde{D}$ is the chemical diffusion coefficient, assumed to be constant. The electrode extends from $x=0$ (surface in contact with electrolyte) to $x=L$ (interface with current collector).\n\nThe initial state of the electrode is equilibrium, with a uniform concentration $c_0$.\n$$ c(x, 0) = c_0 \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le L $$\nDuring the current step, a constant current is applied, which corresponds to a constant flux $J_0$ of lithium into the electrode at the surface $x=0$.\n$$ J_0 = - \\tilde{D} \\left. \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} \\quad \\text{for } 0  t \\le \\Delta t $$\nAt the other end, $x=L$, there is no flux into the current collector.\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=L} = 0 $$\nThe problem states to assume semi-infinite behavior during the current step, which is valid if the diffusion length is much smaller than the electrode thickness, i.e., $\\sqrt{\\tilde{D} \\Delta t} \\ll L$. Under this assumption, the boundary condition at $x=L$ does not influence the concentration profile near the surface at $x=0$ for times $t \\le \\Delta t$. We can therefore solve the diffusion equation on a semi-infinite domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n\nThe solution for the change in concentration, $\\Delta c(x, t) = c(x, t) - c_0$, in a semi-infinite medium with a constant flux $J_0$ imposed at $x=0$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta c(x, t) = 2 J_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{\\pi \\tilde{D}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4\\tilde{D}t}\\right) - \\frac{J_0 x}{\\tilde{D}} \\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\tilde{D}t}}\\right) $$\nThe potential during the current step is determined by the surface concentration.

This amount is distributed over the entire electrode thickness $L$, leading to a change in the average concentration, $\\Delta \\langle c \\rangle$:\n$$ \\Delta \\langle c \\rangle = \\frac{J_0 \\Delta t}{L} $$\nThe change in the equilibrium OCV, $\\Delta E_s$, reflects this change in the spatially averaged concentration:\n$$ \\Delta E_s = E_{\\mathrm{OCV, final}} - E_{\\mathrm{OCV, initial}} = \\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{OCV}}}{\\partial c} \\Delta \\langle c \\rangle $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta \\langle c \\rangle$:\n$$ \\Delta E_s = \\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{OCV}}}{\\partial c} \\left( \\frac{J_0 \\Delta t}{L} \\right) \\quad (2) $$\nThe problem requires an expression relating $\\tilde{D}$ to the measurable quantities $L$, $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta E_t$, and $\\Delta E_s$, without the unknown terms $\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{OCV}}}{\\partial c}$ and $J_0$.

Solid-state diffusion controls rate and the characteristic diffusion time for a spherical particle of radius $R$ is $\\tau = R^{2}/D$.\n2.

This optimization aims to maximize the volumetric capacity, represented by the packing fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r)$, while adhering to a constraint on the rate capability, defined by the volume-weighted mean diffusion time $\\bar{\\tau}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the piecewise expression for the mixture packing fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r)$ as a function of the volume ratio $r = V_{s}/V_{\\ell}$, where $V_{s}$ and $V_{\\ell}$ are the solid volumes of the small and large particles, respectively. The model is hierarchical, based on the assumption that the small particles fill the interstitial voids of the large-particle packing. The monodisperse packing fraction for both particle types is $\\phi_{0}$.\n\nLet $V_{\\ell}$ be the solid volume of the large particles. The bulk volume occupied by these particles, including their own interstitial voids, is $V_{\\ell, \\mathrm{bulk}} = V_{\\ell} / \\phi_{0}$. The volume of these voids is $V_{\\mathrm{void}} = V_{\\ell, \\mathrm{bulk}} - V_{\\ell} = V_{\\ell}(1/\\phi_{0} - 1) = V_{\\ell} \\frac{1-\\phi_{0}}{\\phi_{0}}$.\n\nThe small particles, with solid volume $V_{s}$, pack into this void volume. Because the small particles themselves have a packing fraction of $\\phi_{0}$, the maximum solid volume of small particles that can be accommodated within the voids is $V_{s, \\mathrm{max}} = \\phi_{0} V_{\\mathrm{void}} = \\phi_{0} \\left( V_{\\ell} \\frac{1-\\phi_{0}}{\\phi_{0}} \\right) = V_{\\ell}(1-\\phi_{0})$. The critical volume ratio at which the voids become saturated is thus $r^{\\star} = V_{s, \\mathrm{max}} / V_{\\ell} = 1-\\phi_{0}$.\n\nWe define two regimes for the packing fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r) = (V_{\\ell} + V_{s}) / V_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\le r \\le 1-\\phi_{0}$.\nIn this regime, the small particles fit entirely within the voids of the large-particle structure without increasing the total bulk volume. The total volume of the mixture remains that of the large-particle packing: $V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_{\\ell, \\mathrm{bulk}} = V_{\\ell}/\\phi_{0}$. The total solid volume is $V_{\\ell} + V_{s} = V_{\\ell}(1+r)$. The packing fraction is therefore:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r) = \\frac{V_{\\ell}(1+r)}{V_{\\ell}/\\phi_{0}} = \\phi_{0}(1+r) $$\nThis function increases linearly with $r$.\n\nCase 2: $r  1-\\phi_{0}$.\nIn this regime, the volume of small particles exceeds what can be accommodated in the large-particle voids. The voids are saturated, holding a solid volume $V_{\\ell}(1-\\phi_{0})$ of small particles. The excess solid volume of small particles is $V_{s, \\mathrm{excess}} = V_{s} - V_{\\ell}(1-\\phi_{0}) = V_{\\ell}(r - (1-\\phi_{0}))$. This excess volume forms its own packed structure with fraction $\\phi_{0}$, adding a bulk volume of $V_{s, \\mathrm{excess}}/\\phi_{0}$ to the system. The total volume becomes the sum of the saturated large-particle packing and the bulk volume of the excess small particles:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{V_{\\ell}}{\\phi_{0}} + \\frac{V_{\\ell}(r - 1 + \\phi_{0})}{\\phi_{0}} = \\frac{V_{\\ell}}{\\phi_{0}}(1 + r - 1 + \\phi_{0}) = \\frac{V_{\\ell}}{\\phi_{0}}(r+\\phi_{0}) $$\nThe total solid volume remains $V_{\\ell}(1+r)$. The packing fraction is:\n$$ \\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r) = \\frac{V_{\\ell}(1+r)}{\\frac{V_{\\ell}}{\\phi_{0}}(r+\\phi_{0})} = \\frac{\\phi_{0}(1+r)}{r+\\phi_{0}} $$\nTo determine the behavior of this function, we compute its derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{dr} = \\phi_{0} \\frac{(1)(r+\\phi_{0}) - (1+r)(1)}{(r+\\phi_{0})^2} = \\frac{\\phi_{0}(\\phi_{0}-1)}{(r+\\phi_{0})^2} $$\nSince $\\phi_{0}  1$, the derivative is negative for all $r0$. Thus, for $r  1-\\phi_{0}$, the packing fraction is a decreasing function of $r$.\n\nCombining the two regimes, the function $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r)$ increases linearly to a maximum at $r = r^{\\star} = 1-\\phi_{0}$ and then decreases. The unconstrained optimum for maximizing packing fraction is $r^{\\star} = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36$.\n\nNext, we establish the constraint imposed by the rate requirement.

Dividing the numerator and denominator by $V_{\\ell}$ yields:\n$$ \\bar{\\tau} = \\frac{(V_{s}/V_{\\ell})\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{\\ell}}{(V_{s}/V_{\\ell}) + 1} = \\frac{r\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{\\ell}}{r+1} $$\nThe rate constraint is $\\bar{\\tau} \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}}$. Substituting the expression for $\\bar{\\tau}$:\n$$ \\frac{r\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{\\ell}}{r+1} \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $r$:\n$$ r\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{\\ell} \\le r\\tau_{\\mathrm{req}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\n$$ r(\\tau_{s} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}}) \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}} - \\tau_{\\ell} $$\nWe must compute the characteristic times. Given $R_{s} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $R_{\\ell} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\tau_{s} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-7})^{2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\ell} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-6})^{2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-12}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = 400\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nThe target time is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{req}} = 60\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The term $(\\tau_{s} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}}) = (4.0 - 60) = -56\\ \\mathrm{s}$ is negative. Therefore, dividing the inequality by this term reverses its direction:\n$$ r \\ge \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{req}} - \\tau_{\\ell}}{\\tau_{s} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{req}}} $$\nThis gives the tightest lower bound, $r_{\\mathrm{rate}}$:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{rate}} = \\frac{60 - 400}{4.0 - 60} = \\frac{-340}{-56} = \\frac{340}{56} = \\frac{85}{14} \\approx 6.0714 $$\nThe constraint on the volume ratio is $r \\ge r_{\\mathrm{rate}}$.\n\nFinally, we find the optimal ratio $r_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ that maximizes $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r)$ subject to the constraint $r \\ge r_{\\mathrm{rate}}$. We have the unconstrained maximum at $r^{\\star} = 0.36$ and the rate constraint $r \\ge 85/14 \\approx 6.0714$.\nSince $r_{\\mathrm{rate}}  r^{\\star}$, the entire feasible region lies in the domain where $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $r$. To maximize $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mix}}(r)$ over this region, we must choose the smallest possible value of $r$, which is the boundary of the feasible set.\nTherefore, the optimal volume ratio is $r_{\\mathrm{opt}} = r_{\\mathrm{rate}}$.\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\frac{85}{14} $$\nRounding this to three significant figures gives $6.07$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.07}\n$$", "id": "2496742"}]}
