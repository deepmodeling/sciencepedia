In this case, the concentration profile in the film remains nearly uniform, and the overall relaxation process is limited by the slow surface exchange reaction.\nIf $\\mathcal{L} \\gg 1$, it implies that $\\tau_{\\text{diff}} \\gg \\tau_{\\text{surf}}$, meaning surface exchange is much faster than diffusion. The surface concentrations rapidly equilibrate with the new ambient conditions, while the transport of species through the bulk of the film lags behind. The overall relaxation process is limited by slow bulk diffusion.\n\nIn this problem, $\\mathcal{L} = 10.0$, which is significantly greater than $1$. Therefore, we conclude that the relaxation process is limited by bulk diffusion.

It is assumed that the DFT-calculated total energies at $0~\\mathrm{K}$ are a valid approximation for the Gibbs free energies at room temperature. This implies that changes in entropic contributions ($T\\Delta S$) and volume-work ($P\\Delta V$) during the reaction are negligible compared to the change in enthalpy.
