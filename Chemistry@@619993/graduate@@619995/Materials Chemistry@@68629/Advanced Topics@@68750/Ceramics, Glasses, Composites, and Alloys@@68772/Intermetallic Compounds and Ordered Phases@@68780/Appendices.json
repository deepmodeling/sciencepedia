This involves holding the sample at a temperature slightly below the known ordering temperature ($T_{0} \\approx 663\\ \\mathrm{K}$) for an extended period, typically many hours or days. This allows sufficient time for atomic diffusion to establish a high degree of long-range crystallographic order (the $L1_2$ superlattice). Following this annealing, the sample should be cooled to room temperature at a rate rapid enough to \"freeze\" in the ordered structure, preventing significant disordering during cooling.\n\n(ii) Temperature Program and Heating Rate:\nThe fundamental principle of DSC is to measure the heat flow difference between a sample and an inert reference as a function of temperature. The heat flow required to change the temperature of the sample is given by $\\Phi = d q / dt$. At constant pressure, the heat absorbed, $dq$, is related to the temperature change, $dT$, via the heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_{p}$: $dq = C_{p} dT$. Therefore, the heat flow is $\\Phi = C_{p} (dT/dt)$. To ensure that the measured heat flow is directly proportional to the sample's heat capacity, a constant heating rate, $\\beta = dT/dt$, must be employed. The temperature program should consist of a linear ramp from a temperature well below the transition region (e.g., ~$550\\ \\mathrm{K}$) to a temperature well above it (e.g., ~$750\\ \\mathrm{K}$). The choice of heating rate, $\\beta$, is a compromise: it must be slow enough to minimize thermal gradients within the sample and ensure thermal equilibrium between the sample and the sensor, yet fast enough to produce a signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio. A typical rate such as $10\\ \\mathrm{K\\,min^{-1}}$ is appropriate.\n\n(iii) Baseline Measurement and Subtraction:\nThe total measured heat flow, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t)$, consists of two components. The first is the heat flow required to raise the sample's temperature, which is determined by its heat capacity. This is the baseline contribution, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{base}}(t) = C_{p}(T(t)) \\beta$. The second is the excess heat flow associated with any thermal event, such as a phase transition, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t)$. Thus, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t) = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{base}}(t) + \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t)$. The enthalpy change of the transition, $\\Delta H_{trans}$, is the total heat absorbed or released during the event, which is the time integral of the excess heat flow:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{trans} = \\int_{event} dq_{ex} = \\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nTo find $\\Delta H_{trans}$, one must first isolate $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t)$ by subtracting the baseline: $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t) = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t) - \\Phi_{\\mathrm{base}}(t)$. The baseline is not a simple constant because $C_{p}$ is generally a function of temperature. It is constructed by fitting a suitable function (e.g., a polynomial) to the pre- and post-transition regions of the $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{meas}}(T)$ curve and interpolating through the transition region. This constructed baseline represents the heat flow that would have occurred if the transition were absent. The subtraction is therefore a critical step to separate the thermodynamic signature of the phase transition from the background heat capacity.\n\n(iv) Atmosphere and Pan Selection:\nThe experiment is conducted at elevated temperatures (up to ~$750\\ \\mathrm{K}$ or ~$477\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). At these temperatures, the copper component of the alloy is susceptible to oxidation if exposed to air. Oxidation is an exothermic chemical reaction that would superimpose a large, uncontrolled heat flow signal onto the measurement, completely corrupting the data. To prevent this, the experiment must be conducted under a flowing, high-purity inert atmosphere, such as argon or nitrogen. The sample must be contained in a pan made from a material that is chemically inert with respect to the $\\mathrm{Cu_{3}Au}$ alloy at the experimental temperatures. Platinum or alumina ($\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$) pans are standard choices due to their high melting points and chemical stability.\n\n(v) Calibration:\nFor the measured data to be quantitatively accurate, both the temperature and heat flow axes of the DSC instrument must be calibrated. Temperature calibration is performed by running high-purity standards with well-known, sharp melting points (e.g., Indium, Tin, Zinc) under the same experimental conditions ($\\beta$, atmosphere). A calibration curve is generated to relate the instrument's reported temperature to the true sample temperature. Heat flow calibration is performed by measuring the known enthalpy of fusion ($\\Delta H_{fus}$) of a standard, such as Indium. The area under the melting peak of a known mass of the standard is integrated, and a calibration constant is determined by comparing this measured area to the literature value of $\\Delta H_{fus}$. This ensures that the peak areas measured for the sample can be accurately converted into enthalpy values.\n\nPart B: Data and Calculation\n\nWe are given the functional form of the measured heat flow signal and are asked to calculate the molar enthalpy of ordering, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}}$.\n\nThe enthalpy change associated with a thermal event is the time integral of the excess heat flow power, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. The problem provides $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ as a function of temperature, $T$. With a constant heating rate $\\beta_s = dT/dt$, we can relate the time differential to the temperature differential: $dt = dT/\\beta_s$.\n\nThe total heat absorbed by the sample of mass $m$ during the disordering transition, $\\Delta H_{disordering}$, is found by integrating the excess heat flow over the entire transition:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{disordering} = \\int_{t_{start}}^{t_{end}} \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{s}} \\int_{T_{start}}^{T_{end}} \\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(T)\\,dT\n$$\nThe problem specifies the excess heat flow as a Gaussian function:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\mathrm{ex}}(T) = A\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{(T - T_{0})^{2}}{2\\,\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe integral of this function over a sufficiently wide temperature range that encompasses the entire peak can be approximated by the definite integral from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. The standard result for this integral is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A\\,\\exp(-\\frac{(x - x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2})\\,dx = A \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}$.\n\nThus, the total heat for the transition is:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{disordering} = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{s}} \\left( A \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the enthalpy change for the sample of mass $m$. To obtain the molar enthalpy, we divide by the number of moles, $n = m/M$, where $M$ is the molar mass of $\\mathrm{Cu_{3}Au}$.\n$$\n\\Delta H_{m, disord} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{disordering}}{n} = \\frac{M}{m} \\Delta H_{disordering} = \\frac{M}{m \\beta_{s}} A \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe instrument convention states that endothermic heat flow is positive. The transition from an ordered to a disordered state is an endothermic process (energy is required to break the order), so $\\Delta H_{disordering} = H_{disordered} - H_{ordered} > 0$. The data is consistent with this, as the parameter $A$ is positive ($1.500\\ \\mathrm{mW}$).\n\nThe problem asks for the molar enthalpy of ordering, which is defined as $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} \\equiv H_{\\mathrm{ordered}} - H_{\\mathrm{disordered}}$. This is the reverse process of disordering. Therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = - \\Delta H_{m, disord} = - \\frac{M}{m \\beta_{s}} A \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given values:\n$M = 387.604\\ \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$m = 7.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n$\\beta_{s} = \\frac{1}{6}\\ \\mathrm{K\\,s^{-1}}$\n$A = 1.500\\ \\mathrm{mW} = 1.500 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}$\n$\\sigma = 3.000\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = - \\frac{387.604\\ \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}}{(7.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{g}) \\times (\\frac{1}{6}\\ \\mathrm{K\\,s^{-1}})} \\times (1.500 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (3.000\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = - \\frac{387.604 \\times 6}{7.50 \\times 10^{-3}} \\times (1.500 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 3.000) \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\;\\;\\; \\left[ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = - \\frac{387.604 \\times 6 \\times 4.500 \\times 10^{-3}}{7.50 \\times 10^{-3}} \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\;\\;\\; \\left[ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = - \\frac{387.604 \\times 6 \\times 4.500}{7.50} \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\;\\;\\; \\left[ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} = - 1395.3744 \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\;\\;\\; \\left[ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\approx 2.506628$, we find:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} \\approx - 1395.3744 \\times 2.506628 \\approx -3500.08\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{ord}} \\approx -3.50008\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe input parameters are given to at least three significant figures ($m=7.50\\times 10^{-3}$, $A=1.500$, $\\sigma=3.000$).
