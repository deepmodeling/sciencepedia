In a fully polymerized $\\text{SiO}_2$ network, each silicon atom is at the center of a tetrahedron, bonded to four oxygen atoms. Thus, the coordination number of silicon is $r_{\\text{Si}} = 4$.\nThe constraints on a silicon atom are of two types: bond-stretching and bond-bending.\n- Bond-stretching constraints ($\\alpha$ constraints): Each of the $4$ $\\text{Si-O}$ covalent bonds imposes one constraint. As each constraint is shared equally between the two atoms it connects, the number of stretching constraints attributed to a single Si atom is half of its coordination number.\n$$n_{\\alpha}(\\text{Si}) = \\frac{r_{\\text{Si}}}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$\n- Bond-bending constraints ($\\beta$ constraints): These are the angular constraints centered on the Si atom, corresponding to the $\\text{O-Si-O}$ angles. The problem states these are intact. For a central atom with coordination number $r$, there are $2r-3$ independent angular constraints. For silicon, with $r_{\\text{Si}}=4$:\n$$n_{\\beta}(\\text{Si}) = 2r_{\\text{Si}} - 3 = 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5$$\nThe total number of constraints per silicon atom, $n_c(\\text{Si})$, is the sum of its stretching and bending constraints.\n$$n_c(\\text{Si}) = n_{\\alpha}(\\text{Si}) + n_{\\beta}(\\text{Si}) = 2 + 5 = 7$$\n\nNext, consider the oxygen ($\\text{O}$) atom. The problem specifies that all oxygen atoms are bridging, meaning each oxygen atom connects two silicon atoms. Therefore, the coordination number of oxygen is $r_{\\mathrm{O}} = 2$.\n- Bond-stretching constraints: An oxygen atom participates in two $\\text{Si-O}$ bonds. The number of stretching constraints attributed to a single O atom is half of its coordination number.\n$$n_{\\alpha}(\\mathrm{O}) = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{O}}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\n- Bond-bending constraints: The angular constraint centered on the oxygen atom is the $\\text{Si-O-Si}$ bond angle. The problem explicitly states that this constraint is thermally weakened at the glass transition temperature and is to be treated as broken. Thus, it contributes no count to the rigidity analysis.\n$$n_{\\beta}(\\mathrm{O}) = 0$$\nThe total number of constraints per oxygen atom, $n_c(\\mathrm{O})$, is the sum of its stretching and bending constraints.\n$$n_c(\\mathrm{O}) = n_{\\alpha}(\\mathrm{O}) + n_{\\beta}(\\mathrm{O}) = 1 + 0 = 1$$\n\nStep $2$: Computation of the mean number of constraints per atom, $\\langle n_c \\rangle$.\n\nThe mean number of constraints per atom is the weighted average of the constraints on each atomic species, where the weights are the atomic fractions.

The problem states the system is three-dimensional ($3$D) and only translational degrees of freedom are considered, so $N_\\text{dof} = 3$.\nThe rigidity of the network is classified as follows:\n- If $\\langle n_c \\rangle < N_\\text{dof}$, the network is flexible (underconstrained).\n- If $\\langle n_c \\rangle = N_\\text{dof}$, the network is isostatic (critically constrained).\n- If $\\langle n_c \\rangle > N_\\text{dof}$, the network is stressed-rigid (overconstrained).\n\nIn this case, we have calculated $\\langle n_c \\rangle = 3$ and we have $N_\\text{dof} = 3$.
