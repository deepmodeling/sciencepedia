It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: The atomic packing factor (APF) of Titanium Carbide (TiC) with the rock-salt structure.\n\nThe rock-salt (NaCl) structure is described by a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. In the case of TiC, it consists of two interpenetrating FCC sublattices, one for Titanium (Ti) and one for Carbon (C), displaced from each other by half a lattice parameter along a cube axis. The conventional cubic unit cell, with lattice parameter $a_{\\mathrm{RS}}$, contains $Z=4$ formula units of TiC, meaning it contains $4$ Ti atoms and $4$ C atoms.\n\nThe total volume occupied by atoms within one unit cell is the sum of the volumes of these atoms, modeled as hard spheres:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{atoms}} = 4 \\times V_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + 4 \\times V_{\\mathrm{C}} = 4 \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 \\right) + 4 \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{\\mathrm{C}}^3 \\right) = \\frac{16\\pi}{3} (r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 + r_{\\mathrm{C}}^3) $$\nwhere $r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{C}}$ are the atomic radii.\n\nThe volume of the cubic unit cell is $V_{\\mathrm{cell}} = a_{\\mathrm{RS}}^3$. To determine $a_{\\mathrm{RS}}$, we use the hard-sphere contact condition. In the rock-salt structure, the nearest neighbors are the unlike atoms (Ti and C). The distance between a corner atom and an adjacent face-center atom is half the lattice parameter, $a_{\\mathrm{RS}}/2$. The problem states that Ti and C spheres are in contact along this line. Therefore:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{RS}}}{2} $$\nFrom this, we express the lattice parameter in terms of the radii:\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{RS}} = 2(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}}) $$\nAnd the cell volume becomes:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{cell}} = [2(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})]^3 = 8(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})^3 $$\nThe atomic packing factor, $APF_{\\mathrm{TiC}}$, is the ratio of the atomic volume to the cell volume:\n$$ APF_{\\mathrm{TiC}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{atoms}}}{V_{\\mathrm{cell}}} = \\frac{\\frac{16\\pi}{3} (r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 + r_{\\mathrm{C}}^3)}{8(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})^3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 + r_{\\mathrm{C}}^3}{(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})^3} $$\nTo express this in terms of the radius ratio $y \\equiv r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}/r_{\\mathrm{C}}$, we divide the numerator and denominator by $r_{\\mathrm{C}}^3$:\n$$ APF_{\\mathrm{TiC}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\frac{(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}/r_{\\mathrm{C}})^3 + 1}{((r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}/r_{\\mathrm{C}}) + 1)^3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\frac{y^3 + 1}{(y + 1)^3} $$\nUsing the algebraic identity $y^3 + 1 = (y+1)(y^2 - y + 1)$, we simplify the expression:\n$$ APF_{\\mathrm{TiC}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\frac{(y+1)(y^2 - y + 1)}{(y+1)^3} = \\frac{2\\pi(y^2 - y + 1)}{3(y+1)^2} $$\nThe range of $y$ is determined by the no-overlap constraints for like-like atoms. The nearest neighbor distance for like atoms (e.g., C-C or Ti-Ti) in their respective FCC sublattices is along the face diagonal, equal to $a_{\\mathrm{RS}}/\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor C-C no-overlap: $2r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\le a_{\\mathrm{RS}}/\\sqrt{2}$. Substituting $a_{\\mathrm{RS}} = 2(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})$ gives $2r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\le \\frac{2(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{2}r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\le r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}}$, or $r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}/r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\ge \\sqrt{2}-1$. Thus, $y \\ge \\sqrt{2}-1$.\nFor Ti-Ti no-overlap: $2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le a_{\\mathrm{RS}}/\\sqrt{2}$. This gives $2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le \\frac{2(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}})}{\\sqrt{2}}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{2}r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{C}}$, or $(\\sqrt{2}-1)r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le r_{\\mathrm{C}}$. This implies $r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}/r_{\\mathrm{C}} \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1} = \\sqrt{2}+1$. Thus, $y \\le \\sqrt{2}+1$.\nThe geometric stability range for the hard-sphere model is $\\sqrt{2}-1 \\le y \\le \\sqrt{2}+1$.\n\nNext, we address Task 2: The APF of Titanium Diboride (TiB$_2$) with the AlB$_2$ structure.\n\nThis structure has a hexagonal unit cell with lattice parameters $a_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The cell contains $Z=1$ formula unit, meaning $1$ Ti atom and $2$ B atoms. The volume of atoms in the cell is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{atoms}} = 1 \\times V_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + 2 \\times V_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 + 2\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 + 2r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3) $$\nThe cell volume is given as $V_{\\mathrm{cell}} = V_{\\mathrm{H}} = (\\sqrt{3}/2)a_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 c_{\\mathrm{H}}$. We must relate $a_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{H}}$ to the atomic radii using the given constraints.\nConstraint (i): B-B in-plane contact. The B atoms form a honeycomb network. The nearest-neighbor distance between B atoms in this structure is $a_{\\mathrm{H}}/\\sqrt{3}$. The contact condition is $2r_{\\mathrm{B}} = a_{\\mathrm{H}}/\\sqrt{3}$, which yields $a_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\nConstraint (ii): Ti-B nearest-neighbor contact. A Ti atom at the origin $(0,0,0)$ has its nearest B neighbors at fractional coordinates such as $(1/3, 2/3, 1/2)$. The squared distance $d_{\\mathrm{Ti-B}}^2$ between the origin and this B atom is:\n$$ d_{\\mathrm{Ti-B}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}}}{2}\\right)^2 $$\nThe contact condition is $r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{B}} = d_{\\mathrm{Ti-B}}$. Squaring both sides gives $(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{B}})^2 = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{3} + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{4}$. Substituting $a_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n$$ (r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{B}})^2 = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}})^2}{3} + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{4} = \\frac{12r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2}{3} + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{4} = 4r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 + \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{4} $$\nWe solve for $c_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$ \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{4} = (r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} + r_{\\mathrm{B}})^2 - 4r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 = r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^2 + 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}r_{\\mathrm{B}} - 3r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 $$\n$$ c_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2\\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^2 + 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}r_{\\mathrm{B}} - 3r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2} $$\nFor a real value of $c_{\\mathrm{H}}$, the term under the radical must be non-negative: $r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^2 + 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}r_{\\mathrm{B}} - 3r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 \\ge 0$. Dividing by $r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2$ and using $x \\equiv r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}/r_{\\mathrm{B}}$ gives $x^2 + 2x - 3 \\ge 0$, or $(x+3)(x-1) \\ge 0$. Since $x$ must be positive, this requires $x \\ge 1$.\nNow we compute the cell volume:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{cell}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 c_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} (12r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2) (2\\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^2 + 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}r_{\\mathrm{B}} - 3r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2}) = 12\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 \\sqrt{r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2(x^2+2x-3)} = 12\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3\\sqrt{x^2+2x-3} $$\nThe APF for TiB$_2$ is:\n$$ APF_{\\mathrm{TiB_2}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{atoms}}}{V_{\\mathrm{cell}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^3 + 2r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3)}{12\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3\\sqrt{x^2+2x-3}} = \\frac{4\\pi r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3(x^3+2)}{36\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}^3\\sqrt{x^2+2x-3}} $$\n$$ APF_{\\mathrm{TiB_2}} = \\frac{\\pi(x^3 + 2)}{9\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{x^2+2x-3}} = \\frac{\\pi(x^3 + 2)}{9\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{(x+3)(x-1)}} $$\nConstraint (iii) provides further limits on $x$. Ti-Ti in-plane no-overlap requires $2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le a_{\\mathrm{H}}$, so $2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le 2\\sqrt{3}r_{\\mathrm{B}}$, which means $x \\le \\sqrt{3}$. Ti-Ti no-overlap along the $c$-axis requires $2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\le c_{\\mathrm{H}}$. Squaring this gives $4r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^2 \\le c_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 = 4(r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}^2 + 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}r_{\\mathrm{B}} - 3r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2)$, which simplifies to $0 \\le 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}r_{\\mathrm{B}} - 3r_{\\mathrm{B}}^2$, or $3r_{\\mathrm{B}} \\le 2r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}$. This means $x \\ge 3/2$.\nCombining all constraints on $x$, we have $x \\ge 1$, $x \\le \\sqrt{3}$, and $x \\ge 3/2$. Since $3/2 > 1$, the valid range for $x$ is $3/2 \\le x \\le \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, we address Task 3: Comparison of diffusion pathways.\n\nThe analysis must be based on the topology of the interstitial space in each crystal structure.\nTiC possesses the cubic rock-salt structure. This high-symmetry structure results in an isotropic distribution of atoms and, consequently, an isotropic topology of the interstitial voids. The main diffusion pathways for small interstitial species would involve hopping between adjacent tetrahedral voids, which form a connected network. Due to the cubic symmetry, the energy barriers for such hops are expected to be identical along all equivalent crystallographic directions. Therefore, diffusion in TiC is expected to be isotropic.\n\nIn stark contrast, TiB$_2$ has a layered hexagonal structure, which is inherently anisotropic. It is composed of alternating planar layers of Ti atoms and B atoms arranged in a rigid honeycomb (graphitic) network. This structural anisotropy creates a highly anisotropic interstitial space. Specifically, the centers of the boron hexagons align along the $c$-axis, forming open, continuous channels through the structure. These channels offer a low-potential-energy pathway for the diffusion of small interstitial species along the $c$-axis. Conversely, diffusion within the basal plane (perpendicular to the $c$-axis) would require the diffusing species to move through the dense-packed B-layers or squeeze past B and Ti atoms, a process associated with a significantly higher energy barrier.\n\nTherefore, TiB$_2$ is expected to exhibit more anisotropic diffusion pathways. The layered atomic arrangement creates preferential, low-resistance diffusion channels along the $c$-axis, leading to much faster diffusion in this direction compared to directions within the basal plane. TiC, being structurally isotropic, will exhibit isotropic diffusion properties.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2\\pi(y^2 - y + 1)}{3(y+1)^2} & \\frac{\\pi(x^3 + 2)}{9\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{(x+3)(x-1)}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2517195"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable strength of refractory ceramics is counterbalanced by their inherent brittleness, making fracture resistance a critical performance metric.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. The material properties and loading conditions for boron carbide ($\\mathrm{B_4C}$) are physically realistic.\n\nThe solution proceeds as requested, starting from the fundamental principles of fracture mechanics.\n\nThe Griffith theory of brittle fracture postulates that a crack will propagate when the energy released from the elastic strain field is sufficient to provide the energy required to create the new fracture surfaces. This energy balance is quantified by the energy release rate, $G$, which is the energy dissipated per unit increase in crack area. Catastrophic fracture occurs when $G$ reaches a critical value, $G_c$, which is a measure of the material's toughness. The fracture criterion is thus:\n$$ G \\ge G_c $$\nIn the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics, for a body under mode-I (opening mode) loading in a state of plane strain, the energy release rate $G$ is related to the mode-I stress intensity factor $K_I$ by the Irwin relation:\n$$ G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E}(1-\\nu^2) $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio of the material. Consequently, the fracture criterion can be reformulated in terms of the stress intensity factor. Fracture initiates when $K_I$ reaches a critical value, the plane-strain fracture toughness $K_{IC}$, which is a material property. At the point of fracture initiation, the condition is:\n$$ K_I = K_{IC} $$\nThe stress intensity factor $K_I$ for a body with a crack is a function of the applied stress, the crack size, and the geometry of the body and crack. For a central through-thickness crack of total length $2a$ in a plate subjected to a uniform remote tensile stress $\\sigma$ perpendicular to the crack plane, $K_I$ is given by:\n$$ K_I = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nHere, $a$ is the half-length of the crack, and $Y$ is a dimensionless geometry factor that depends on the ratio of the crack length to the width of the plate. For a macroscopically large body, often idealized as an infinite plate, this factor $Y$ approaches unity.\n\nTo derive the expression for the critical half-crack length, $a_c$, at which fast fracture begins, we substitute the expression for $K_I$ into the fracture criterion $K_I = K_{IC}$:\n$$ Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a_c} = K_{IC} $$\nThis equation defines the critical condition for fracture. We now solve for $a_c$. First, we isolate the square root term:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\pi a_c} = \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y \\sigma} $$\nNext, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n$$ \\pi a_c = \\left( \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y \\sigma} \\right)^2 $$\nFinally, we solve for $a_c$ to obtain the general expression for the critical half-crack length:\n$$ a_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y \\sigma} \\right)^2 $$\nThis is the required general expression for the critical half-crack length.\n\nThe problem then asks to specialize this result for an idealized infinite plate, for which the geometry factor is $Y=1$. Substituting $Y=1$ into the general expression yields:\n$$ a_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{IC}}{\\sigma} \\right)^2 $$\nThis is the specific expression for an infinite plate with a central through-thickness crack.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $a_c$ for boron carbide ($\\mathrm{B_4C}$) using the provided data:\nThe plane-strain fracture toughness is $K_{IC} = 3.0~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.\nThe applied remote tensile stress is $\\sigma = 300~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nSubstituting these values into the specialized equation:\n$$ a_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3.0~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{300~\\mathrm{MPa}} \\right)^2 $$\nThe ratio of the stresses simplifies:\n$$ \\frac{3.0}{300} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01 $$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$ a_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( 0.01\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (0.0001~\\mathrm{m}) = \\frac{10^{-4}}{\\pi}~\\mathrm{m} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ a_c \\approx \\frac{10^{-4}}{3.14159265...}~\\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.18309886... \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and rounded to four significant figures. We perform the unit conversion:\n$$ 1~\\mathrm{m} = 10^6~\\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\n$$ a_c \\approx (3.18309886... \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 31.8309886...~\\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ a_c \\approx 31.83~\\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nThis is the critical half-length of a crack that will lead to catastrophic failure in the specified $\\mathrm{B_4C}$ plate under the given stress.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31.83}$$", "id": "2517198"}]}
