It presents a standard, albeit simplified, theoretical model from materials kinetics known as Avrami theory. The definitions, parameters, and relationships are consistent with established first principles of phase transformation theory. All necessary information is provided to derive the Avrami exponent $n$ without ambiguity. The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental principles of kinetics.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation from First Principles**\nThe foundation of this analysis is the definition of the extended volume fraction, $X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t)$. It is the total volume fraction that would have transformed if the growing domains could freely overlap. Let $I_V(t')$ be the nucleation rate per unit volume at time $t'$, and let $V(t-t')$ be the volume at time $t$ of a single domain that nucleated at time $t'$. The extended volume is given by the convolution integral:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} I_V(t') V(t-t') dt'$$\nThe volume of a single $d$-dimensional domain that nucleated at $t'$ and grew until time $t$ must be formulated. The linear size is $R(t-t') = G(t-t')^m$, where $G$ is a growth constant. The volume is thus $V(t-t') = g_d [R(t-t')]^d = g_d G^d (t-t')^{md}$, where $g_d$ is a geometric shape factor.\n\nWe analyze the two specified nucleation modes.\n\n**Case 1: Site-Saturated Nucleation**\nIn this scenario, all potential nuclei are activated instantaneously at $t=0$. Let $N_V$ be the number of such nuclei per unit volume. The nucleation rate can be described using the Dirac delta function: $I_V(t') = N_V \\delta(t')$.\nSubstituting this into the integral for $X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t)$:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} N_V \\delta(t') V(t-t') dt'$$\nBy the properties of the delta function, the integral evaluates to the value of the remaining part of the integrand at $t'=0$:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = N_V V(t-0) = N_V V(t) = N_V g_d G^d t^{md}$$\nWe compare this result to the given form $X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = (kt)^n$. The time dependence dictates the exponent. It is immediately clear that for site-saturated nucleation:\n$$n = md$$\n\n**Case 2: Constant Nucleation Rate**\nHere, nuclei form at a constant rate $I_V(t') = I_0$ for all $t' \\ge 0$.\nWe substitute this into the integral for $X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t)$:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} I_0 V(t-t') dt' = \\int_{0}^{t} I_0 \\left[ g_d G^d (t-t')^{md} \\right] dt'$$\nThe constants can be moved outside the integral:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = I_0 g_d G^d \\int_{0}^{t} (t-t')^{md} dt'$$\nThe integral is elementary. Let $u = t-t'$, so $du = -dt'$. The limits of integration change from $t'=0 \\rightarrow u=t$ and $t'=t \\rightarrow u=0$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{t} (t-t')^{md} dt' = \\int_{t}^{0} u^{md} (-du) = \\int_{0}^{t} u^{md} du = \\left[ \\frac{u^{md+1}}{md+1} \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{t^{md+1}}{md+1}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t)$:\n$$X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = I_0 g_d G^d \\left( \\frac{t^{md+1}}{md+1} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{I_0 g_d G^d}{md+1} \\right) t^{md+1}$$\nComparing this result to $X_{\\mathrm{e}}(t) = (kt)^n$, the time dependence reveals the exponent.

Successfully navigating this problem requires a careful consideration of data processing, from baseline correction to handling instrumental artifacts, and a critical eye for systematic errors. It is a practical simulation of the data analysis a materials scientist performs to quantify the thermal stability of a glassy alloy.", "problem": "A bulk metallic glass ribbon is subjected to an isothermal hold inside a Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) instrument, at a temperature within its supercooled liquid region. The measured exothermic heat flow relaxes from an initial maximum back to a stable baseline over a finite time. Independent calibration confirms that the instrument’s heat flow signal is proportional to the rate of enthalpy release and that mass normalization is accurate. You wish to extract an Avrami exponent $n$ and an isothermal rate constant $k$ for crystallization from this single isothermal exotherm using Avrami analysis, and to identify dominant sources of systematic error.\n\nFrom fundamental considerations, the Avrami approach models the transformation fraction $X(t)$ under isothermal conditions based on assumptions about nucleation and growth. In a calorimetric experiment, the transformation fraction can be related to the time-integrated exothermic heat after appropriate baseline treatment. In practice, the analysis requires careful data reduction and attention to instrument and sample artifacts.\n\nWhich of the following protocols correctly describe how to extract $n$ and $k$ from the isothermal DSC exotherm and correctly identify the dominant sources of systematic error? Select all that apply.\n\nA. Subtract a constant baseline from the heat flow to isolate the exothermic signal, integrate the baseline-corrected heat flow to obtain the cumulative released enthalpy $H(t)$, and normalize by the total crystallization enthalpy $H_{\\infty}$ to obtain $X(t)=H(t)/H_{\\infty}$ with $X(t)\\in[0,1]$. To account for early-time temperature equilibration and incubation, introduce a time shift $t^{\\prime}=t-t_{0}$ determined by maximizing the linearity of an Avrami transformation of $X(t)$, and then use the linearized Avrami plot to estimate $n$ from the slope and $k$ from the intercept over the time window where the model is valid. Dominant systematic errors include baseline drift and misestimation of $H_{\\infty}$ (e.g., due to overlapping structural relaxation or secondary crystallization), instrument response and thermal lag that bias $t_{0}$, sample internal temperature gradients or heat-transfer limits that violate isothermality, and time-varying kinetics (e.g., nucleation rate changes or impingement) that cause curvature and apparent $n$ variation.\n\nB. Determine the temperature at the exotherm peak under the isothermal hold and combine it with the instrument’s programmed heating rate to construct a Kissinger plot of $\\ln(\\beta/T_{p}^{2})$ versus $1/T_{p}$ from this single isothermal experiment. The slope of this plot gives an activation energy, and the intercept yields $k$, while $n$ is obtained from the peak width. Dominant systematic errors arise only from mass normalization; baseline and incubation effects are negligible.\n\nC. Without integrating the heat flow, take the raw exotherm signal and form a plot of $\\ln(\\dot{q}(t))$ versus $\\ln(t)$ over the entire transformation. The slope equals $n-1$ and the intercept gives $\\ln(n k^{n})$, so both $n$ and $k$ can be obtained by linear regression across the full time range. Systematic errors are minimized by using the largest possible portion of the exotherm, since averaging reduces noise, and there is no need to correct for incubation.\n\nD. Estimate $n$ from the ratio of the exotherm peak height to its full width at half maximum, and take $k$ as the reciprocal of the time to completion (defined by when the heat flow first returns to baseline). Systematic errors are dominated by random noise; model assumptions about nucleation and growth do not affect the extracted parameters.\n\nE. After baseline correction and conversion to $X(t)=H(t)/H_{\\infty}$, perform a direct nonlinear least-squares fit of an isothermal Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) model for $X(t)$ to the data, treating $n$, $k$, and an incubation time $t_{0}$ as free parameters, optionally convolving the model with a measured DSC instrument response function to account for finite response time. Evaluate goodness of fit only over the time window where the exotherm is uncontaminated by overlapping reactions. Dominant systematic errors include uncertainty in $H_{\\infty}$, baseline drift, instrument response and thermal lag (mitigated by the response convolution and $t_{0}$), and deviations from JMAK assumptions (time-dependent nucleation rate, anisotropic or diffusion-limited growth, impingement effects) that produce parameter non-uniqueness or time-dependent apparent $n$.", "solution": "The problem statement is submitted for validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- **System:** A bulk metallic glass ribbon.\n- **Process:** Isothermal crystallization within the supercooled liquid region.\n- **Measurement:** Exothermic heat flow versus time, measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The DSC signal is proportional to the rate of enthalpy release.\n- **Objective:** To determine the Avrami exponent, $n$, and the isothermal rate constant, $k$, from a single DSC exotherm, and to identify the main sources of systematic error.\n- **Theoretical Framework:** The Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model, which relates the transformed fraction, $X(t)$, to time, $t$, under isothermal conditions. The transformed fraction $X(t)$ is obtainable from the time-integrated heat flow.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of materials science, specifically the kinetics of phase transformations in amorphous materials. The use of DSC to study crystallization and the application of the Avrami (JMAK) model for analysis represent standard and well-established scientific practice. All premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem asks to identify the correct experimental analysis protocol among a set of choices. As there are established, correct methodologies for this analysis, the problem is well-posed and admits a definitive answer based on scientific consensus.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical and devoid of subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is found to be valid. It is a rigorous question concerning experimental data analysis in physical chemistry and materials science. We shall proceed to the solution by analyzing each option against fundamental principles.\n\nThe core of the analysis is the JMAK equation for the transformed fraction $X$ as a function of time $t$:\n$$ X(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-(kt)^n\\right) $$\nwhere $n$ is the Avrami exponent and $k$ is the effective rate constant. In calorimetry, the transformed fraction is determined from the heat flow, $\\dot{q}(t)$, which is proportional to the transformation rate, $dX/dt$. Specifically,\n$$ X(t) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{q}_{\\text{exo}}(t') dt'}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\dot{q}_{\\text{exo}}(t') dt'} = \\frac{H(t)}{H_{\\infty}} $$\nwhere $\\dot{q}_{\\text{exo}}(t)$ is the baseline-corrected exothermic heat flow, $H(t)$ is the partial enthalpy of crystallization, and $H_{\\infty}$ is the total enthalpy of crystallization. Rigorous analysis must account for experimental artifacts.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis option proposes a protocol based on the linearization of the JMAK equation. The JMAK equation can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\ln(-\\ln(1 - X(t))) = n \\ln(t) + n \\ln(k) $$\nA plot of $\\ln(-\\ln(1 - X(t)))$ versus $\\ln(t)$ should yield a straight line with slope $n$ and an intercept related to $k$.\n\n- **Protocol Evaluation:** The steps described are correct.\n    1.  Baseline subtraction and integration to compute $X(t) = H(t)/H_{\\infty}$ is the standard procedure.\n    2.  The introduction of a time shift, $t' = t - t_0$, to account for incubation phenomena and instrument thermal lag is a critical and necessary correction. The criterion of maximizing linearity in the Avrami plot is a common method for determining $t_0$.\n    3.  Extracting $n$ from the slope and $k$ from the intercept of the linearized plot is the essence of the \"Avrami plot\" method. The specification that this is done \"over the time window where the model is valid\" is crucial, as deviations are expected at very early and very late stages of transformation.\n- **Error Identification Evaluation:** The list of systematic errors is comprehensive and accurate. Baseline determination, estimation of $H_{\\infty}$, instrument thermal lag ($t_0$), violation of isothermality (recalescence), and deviations from model assumptions (e.g., non-constant nucleation rate) are indeed the dominant challenges in this experiment.\n\n**Verdict for A:** The protocol and the identification of systematic errors are entirely correct. This describes the classical, rigorous method for Avrami analysis. **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis option proposes using the Kissinger method. The Kissinger equation is:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{T_p^2}\\right) = -\\frac{E_a}{R T_p} + \\text{constant} $$\nThis method is applicable exclusively to non-isothermal experiments, where a sample is heated at a constant rate $\\beta$ and the crystallization peak temperature, $T_p$, is recorded. One must perform several such scans at different heating rates $\\beta$ to construct the plot.\n- **Protocol Evaluation:** The problem states the experiment is an *isothermal* hold. In an isothermal experiment, the heating rate $\\beta = 0$ and the temperature is constant. It is therefore a logical and physical impossibility to construct a Kissinger plot from a single isothermal experiment. This proposal demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of kinetic analysis methods.\n- **Error Identification Evaluation:** The claim that only mass normalization is a dominant error and that baseline/incubation effects are negligible is patently false.\n\n**Verdict for B:** The proposed methodology is nonsensical and inapplicable to the described experiment. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis option proposes a differential method. The transformation rate is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = n k^n t^{n-1} \\exp(-(kt)^n) $$\nThe heat flow is $\\dot{q}(t) = H_{\\infty} (dX/dt)$. Taking the logarithm gives:\n$$ \\ln(\\dot{q}(t)) = \\ln(H_{\\infty} n k^n) + (n-1)\\ln(t) - (kt)^n $$\nA plot of $\\ln(\\dot{q}(t))$ versus $\\ln(t)$ is not a straight line due to the $-(kt)^n$ term. An approximation, $\\exp(-(kt)^n) \\approx 1$, is valid only at very short times ($t \\to 0$), which makes the plot linear in that limited region.\n- **Protocol Evaluation:** The option incorrectly claims linearity \"over the entire transformation\" and that one can use \"the largest possible portion of the exotherm\". This is a severe error; the method is an approximation valid only for the initial stage of transformation, i.e., $X(t) \\ll 1$. Ignoring the need for baseline correction (\"raw exotherm signal\") and incubation time correction are also critical flaws.\n- **Error Identification Evaluation:** The assertion that this method minimizes systematic errors and that incubation correction is unnecessary is false.\n\n**Verdict for C:** The method is described incorrectly and its domain of applicability is grossly overstated. The error analysis is also wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis option proposes estimating parameters from simple geometric features of the peak.\n- **Protocol Evaluation:** While there exist approximate relationships between the Avrami exponent $n$ and the shape of the transformation peak (e.g., its asymmetry or relative width), deriving $n$ from a simple ratio of peak height to FWHM is a crude approximation, not a rigorous protocol. Furthermore, defining $k$ simply as the reciprocal of a \"time to completion\" is incorrect. The time to completion is ill-defined as the signal approaches the baseline asymptotically, and the relationship between any characteristic time $t_x$ (time to $X\\%$ completion) and $k$ is $t_x = (-\\ln(1-x))^{1/n}/k$, not simply $t_x \\propto 1/k$.\n- **Error Identification Evaluation:** The claim that systematic errors are dominated by random noise is preposterous. In calorimetry, systematic effects from baseline, thermal lag, and sample-instrument interaction are almost always more significant. To state that model assumptions do not affect parameters that are defined *by the model itself* is a logical absurdity.\n\n**Verdict for D:** The protocol is a crude, non-rigorous approximation, and the error analysis is fundamentally flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis option proposes direct non-linear fitting of the JMAK model to the experimental $X(t)$ data.\n- **Protocol Evaluation:** This is a modern and statistically robust alternative to the linearization method in Option A.\n    1.  The initial data processing ($X(t) = H(t)/H_{\\infty}$) is correct.\n    2.  Performing a non-linear least-squares fit of the model $X(t) = 1 - \\exp(-(k(t-t_0))^n)$ with $n$, $k$, and $t_0$ as fitting parameters is a standard and powerful technique.\n    3.  The suggestion to convolve the theoretical model with an instrument response function is an advanced technique that represents the highest level of rigor in accounting for instrumental artifacts.\n    4.  Limiting the fit to a valid region uncontaminated by other effects is, again, a mark of a correct procedure.\n- **Error Identification Evaluation:** The list of systematic errors is correct and comprehensive. It rightly points out uncertainty in $H_{\\infty}$ and baseline drift. It also correctly identifies how the proposed fitting procedure (use of $t_0$ and convolution) actively mitigates some of these errors. Finally, it correctly identifies deviations from the JMAK model's own assumptions as a source of systematic uncertainty, a subtle but critical point.\n\n**Verdict for E:** This option describes a valid, rigorous, and modern protocol for Avrami analysis. The identification of systematic errors and mitigation strategies is sophisticated and accurate. **Correct**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth Option A and Option E describe correct and rigorous protocols for performing Avrami analysis on isothermal DSC data. Option A describes the classical linearization method, while Option E describes the modern non-linear fitting approach. Both options also provide an accurate and thorough assessment of the dominant systematic errors.

Analysis of Cooling and Crystallization\nThe cooling of the cylinder is governed by heat diffusion. The characteristic time, $\\tau_{cool}$, for heat to diffuse from the center ($r=0$) of a body of size $L$ is given by the scaling law $\\tau_{cool} \\sim L^2/\\alpha$. For the cylindrical rod of radius $R$, the characteristic time for the center to cool is:\n$$ \\tau_{cool} \\approx \\frac{R^2}{\\alpha} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\tau_{cool} \\approx \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = 6.25\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nCrystallization is avoided if the time spent by the alloy in the critical temperature range around the CCT nose ($T_n=700\\,\\mathrm{K}$) is less than the critical time $t_n \\approx 1.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The cooling time of the center, $\\tau_{cool} \\approx 6.25\\,\\mathrm{s}$, is significantly longer than $t_n$. Therefore, the center of the rod cools too slowly to bypass the CCT nose, and it will crystallize. This implies the formation of a crystalline core.\n\nConversely, regions near the surface cool much more rapidly. An amorphous (glassy) structure is retained in a surface layer where the local cooling time is less than $t_n$. We can estimate the thickness of this amorphous rim, $d_c$, by setting the diffusion time across this thickness equal to the critical time $t_n$:\n$$ t_n \\approx \\frac{d_c^2}{\\alpha} $$\nSolving for $d_c$:\n$$ d_c \\approx \\sqrt{\\alpha t_n} = \\sqrt{(4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (1.5\\,\\mathrm{s})} = \\sqrt{6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 2.45 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThus, an amorphous rim of thickness $d_c \\approx 2.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is expected to form. Given the total radius of $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, this is a substantial fraction of the cross-section. The radial profile of crystallinity, $X(r)$, is therefore approximately zero for $r > (R-d_c) \\approx 2.55\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and greater than zero for $r < 2.55\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, reaching a maximum at the center, $r=0$.\n\n2.  Analysis of Fictive Temperature and Hardness in the Amorphous Rim\nWithin the amorphous rim ($R-d_c < r \\le R$), the properties are governed by the local cooling rate, $|dT/dt|$. The cooling rate is highest at the quench surface ($r=R$) and decreases progressively inward.\nThe fictive temperature, $T_f$, represents the temperature at which the liquid's atomic structure is kinetically arrested. A higher cooling rate provides less time for structural relaxation, \"freezing in\" a less-relaxed, higher-energy, higher-volume state characteristic of a higher temperature. Therefore, $T_f$ increases with the cooling rate.\n$$ |dT/dt| \\text{ is maximum at } r=R \\text{ and decreases for } r<R. $$\n$$ \\implies T_f(r) \\text{ is maximum at } r=R \\text{ and decreases for } r<R \\text{ in the amorphous rim.} $$\nHardness, $H$, in metallic glasses is inversely correlated with the amount of free volume, which is itself directly correlated with $T_f$. A higher $T_f$ implies a less dense, less relaxed structure with more free volume. Such a structure offers less resistance to plastic deformation (shear band formation), resulting in lower hardness.\n$$ H(r) \\propto \\frac{1}{T_f(r)} $$\nTherefore, the hardness is lowest at the surface ($r=R$) where the cooling rate and $T_f$ are highest, and it increases inward toward the interface with the crystalline core.\n\n3.  Hardness of the Crystalline Core\nThe crystalline phases that form in BMG-forming alloys are typically hard intermetallic compounds. The resulting microstructure in the core is a composite of these hard phases, possibly with some residual amorphous matrix. Such a crystalline or partially crystalline structure is almost invariably harder and more brittle than its fully amorphous counterpart. Therefore, the hardness in the core, $H_{core}$, will be significantly higher than the hardness anywhere in the amorphous rim, $H_{rim}$.\n\nSummary of predictions:\n-   **Crystallinity $X(r)$**: Zero in an outer rim of thickness $\\approx 2.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, non-zero in the core.\n-   **Fictive Temperature $T_f(r)$**: In the rim, highest at the surface ($r=R$) and decreases inward.\n-   **Hardness $H(r)$**: In the rim, lowest at the surface ($r=R$) and increases inward. Hardness in the core is higher than in the rim.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n\nA. A crystalline core forms, with an amorphous rim of thickness on the order of $d_c\\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha t_n}\\approx 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ from the surface; in the amorphous rim, $T_f(r)$ is highest at the surface and decreases inward, so $H(r)$ is lowest at the surface and increases toward the rim–core interface; within the core, the presence of intermetallic crystals increases $H$ relative to the amorphous rim.\nThis statement correctly identifies the formation of a crystalline core and amorphous rim. The estimate for the rim thickness, $d_c \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha t_n} \\approx 2.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, matches our order-of-magnitude calculation. The trend for $T_f(r)$ (highest at surface) is correct. The resulting trend for $H(r)$ in the rim (lowest at surface) is also correct. Finally, the statement that the crystalline core is harder than the amorphous rim is correct. Every part of this option is consistent with our derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The entire cross-section remains fully amorphous because the center cools on a timescale much shorter than $t_n$; $T_f(r)$ and $H(r)$ are essentially uniform, and no crystalline core is expected.\nThis is incorrect. The cooling timescale at the center, $\\tau_{cool} \\approx 6.25\\,\\mathrm{s}$, is longer, not shorter, than $t_n \\approx 1.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Thus, a crystalline core is expected. Furthermore, the cooling rate varies significantly with radius, so $T_f(r)$ and $H(r)$ cannot be uniform.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Because the surface is in contact with a cold mold, it is the most structurally relaxed region; thus $T_f(r)$ is lowest at the surface and highest at the center, yielding the highest $H$ at the surface; no crystallinity develops because heat flows outward from the center.\nThis is incorrect. The surface cools fastest and is therefore the *least* structurally relaxed, having the highest $T_f$. Consequently, it has the lowest hardness, not the highest. The claim that no crystallinity develops is also false, as shown by the comparison of $\\tau_{cool}$ and $t_n$. The reasoning \"because heat flows outward\" is irrelevant to whether crystallization occurs; the rate of heat flow is what matters.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $T_f(r)$ is highest at the surface due to the fastest cooling, and hardness is also highest at the surface because rapid quenching “freezes in” a denser structure; crystallinity, if any, nucleates as a thin layer near the surface where temperature gradients are largest, leaving the center amorphous.\nThis option correctly states that $T_f$ is highest at the surface. However, it incorrectly claims that hardness is also highest at the surface, based on the false premise that rapid quenching freezes in a \"denser\" structure. Rapid quenching freezes in a less-dense, higher-free-volume structure. Furthermore, it incorrectly predicts that crystallization occurs near the surface and that the center remains amorphous. This is the opposite of the correct physical behavior; the slow-cooling center crystallizes while the fast-cooling surface forms a glass.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2500092"}]}
