It presents a standard problem in statistical thermodynamics as applied to materials science, specifically the field of high-entropy alloys. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe starting point is the Boltzmann relation for the configurational entropy, $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$, of a system with multiplicity $W$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} = k_{B} \\ln W$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. For a multicomponent alloy with $c$ components, we consider the arrangement of $N_{i}$ indistinguishable atoms of species $i$ on a total of $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} N_{i}$ equivalent lattice sites. The multiplicity $W$ is the number of distinct ways to arrange these atoms, which is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$$W = \\frac{N!}{N_{1}! N_{2}! \\cdots N_{c}!} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{c} N_{i}!}$$\nSubstituting this into the Boltzmann relation gives:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} = k_{B} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{c} N_{i}!}\\right) = k_{B} \\left( \\ln(N!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} \\ln(N_{i}!) \\right)$$\nFor a macroscopic system, the numbers $N$ and $N_{i}$ are very large. We can therefore apply Stirling's approximation for the natural logarithm of a factorial, $\\ln(z!) \\approx z \\ln z - z$. Applying this approximation:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx k_{B} \\left( (N \\ln N - N) - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} (N_{i} \\ln N_{i} - N_{i}) \\right)$$\nDistributing the summation and simplifying:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx k_{B} \\left( N \\ln N - N - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} N_{i} \\ln N_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{c} N_{i} \\right)$$\nSince by definition $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} N_{i}$, the terms $-N$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{c} N_{i}$ cancel each other.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx k_{B} \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} N_{i} \\ln N_{i} \\right)$$\nNow, we introduce the mole fraction of each species, $x_{i} = N_{i}/N$, which implies $N_{i} = x_{i}N$. Substituting this into the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx k_{B} \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} (x_{i}N) \\ln(x_{i}N) \\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(ab) = \\ln a + \\ln b$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx k_{B} \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i}N (\\ln x_{i} + \\ln N) \\right)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx k_{B} \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i}N \\ln x_{i} - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i}N \\ln N \\right)$$\nThe last term can be simplified by factoring out constants from the summation: $\\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i}N \\ln N = N \\ln N \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i}$.

For the unmixed pure components, each consists of only one type of atom, so the multiplicity is $W_{i} = 1$ and the configurational entropy is $S_{i} = k_{B} \\ln(1) = 0$. Thus, the total configurational entropy of the unmixed state is $S_{\\mathrm{unmixed}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} S_{i} = 0$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = S_{\\mathrm{config}} - S_{\\mathrm{unmixed}} = -k_{B}N \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i} \\ln x_{i} - 0 = -k_{B}N \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i} \\ln x_{i}$$\nTo find the molar entropy of mixing, we divide by the total number of moles, $n = N/N_{A}$, where $N_{A}$ is Avogadro's number. The universal gas constant is $R = k_{B}N_{A}$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix, molar}} = \\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{n} = \\frac{-k_{B}N \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i} \\ln x_{i}}{N/N_{A}} = -k_{B}N_{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i} \\ln x_{i}$$\nThis gives the general expression for the molar configurational entropy of mixing for an ideal solution, which we will denote as $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R \\sum_{i=1}^{c} x_{i} \\ln x_{i}$$\nThis derivation fulfills the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given $5$-component ($c=5$) alloy with mole fractions $(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}) = (0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1)$. We are asked to report the value of $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}/R$.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R} = - \\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i} \\ln x_{i}$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R} = - \\left( 0.4 \\ln(0.4) + 0.2 \\ln(0.2) + 0.2 \\ln(0.2) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1) \\right)$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R} = - \\left( 0.4 \\ln(0.4) + 2(0.2 \\ln(0.2)) + 2(0.1 \\ln(0.1)) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R} = - \\left( 0.4 \\ln(0.4) + 0.4 \\ln(0.2) + 0.2 \\ln(0.1) \\right)$$\nUsing the numerical values of the natural logarithms: $\\ln(0.4) \\approx -0.91629$, $\\ln(0.2) \\approx -1.60944$, $\\ln(0.1) \\approx -2.30259$.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R} \\approx - \\left( 0.4(-0.91629) + 0.4(-1.60944) + 0.2(-2.30259) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R} \\approx - \\left( -0.366516 - 0.643776 - 0.460518 \\right) = -(-1.47081) = 1.47081$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.471$.\n\nFinally, we compare this value to the equiatomic quinary case. For an equiatomic composition, $x_{i} = 1/c = 1/5 = 0.2$ for all $i$. The entropy of mixing for this case is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R}\\right)_{\\mathrm{eq}} = - \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = -5 \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\right) = -\\ln(0.2) = \\ln(5)$$\nNumerically, $(\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}/R)_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx 1.60944$. This value represents the maximum possible configurational entropy of mixing for a $5$-component system.\nThe calculated entropy for the skewed composition, $1.471$, is approximately $1.471 / 1.609 \\approx 91.4\\%$ of the maximum possible value.\nThis comparison reveals a critical feature of multicomponent systems: the configurational entropy of mixing is relatively insensitive to deviations from the equiatomic composition. The given composition, with one component's concentration being double the equiatomic value ($0.4$ vs $0.2$) and two others being halved ($0.1$ vs $0.2$), represents a significant skew. Despite this, the entropy remains high, losing less than $10\\%$ from its theoretical maximum. The function $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}(\\{x_i\\})$ is a concave function that is relatively flat near its maximum. This robustness of high configurational entropy is a fundamental reason why the \"high-entropy alloy\" concept is not restricted to equiatomic compositions and why many technologically important HEAs are non-equiatomic. The large entropic contribution to the Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} - T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$) remains a dominant factor in stabilizing a single-phase solid solution over intermetallic compounds, even for compositions far from the equiatomic center of the phase diagram.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.471}\n$$", "id": "2490268"}, {"introduction": "While high configurational entropy provides a strong driving force for mixing, it is not the only factor governing phase stability, as severe lattice distortion can destabilize a solid solution.

We shall proceed with its formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive a dimensionless parameter, $\\delta$, that quantifies the atomic size mismatch in a multicomponent alloy, based on a set of physical assumptions.\n\nFirst, we formalize the given assumptions. The alloy is a substitutional solid solution with component mole fractions $\\{c_i\\}$ and corresponding metallic radii $\\{r_i\\}$, satisfying $\\sum_i c_i = 1$.\nAssumption (ii), the application of Vegard's law to an ideal solution, dictates that the characteristic lattice parameter scales with the composition-weighted average of atomic sizes. Thus, we define the mean metallic radius, $\\bar{r}$, as:\n$$\n\\bar{r} = \\sum_{i} c_i r_i\n$$\nThis mean radius, $\\bar{r}$, represents the average atomic size in the mean-field environment of the crystal lattice. An atom of species $i$ with radius $r_i$ embedded in this average lattice experiences a size mismatch.\n\nFrom dimensional analysis, the local dilatational misfit strain, $\\varepsilon_i$, associated with species $i$ must be a dimensionless quantity.

The term $\\sum_i c_i \\left(\\frac{r_i - \\bar{r}}{\\bar{r}}\\right)^2$ is the mean squared strain and is already dimensionless. A standard approach is to use a root-mean-square (RMS) measure, which has the same units as the strain itself and represents the standard deviation of the strain. We define a preliminary measure as the square root of this quantity:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\text{preliminary}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_i c_i \\left(\\frac{r_i - \\bar{r}}{\\bar{r}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_i c_i (r_i - \\bar{r})^2}}{\\bar{r}}\n$$\nWe must verify that this measure is invariant under a uniform scaling of all radii, $r_i \\rightarrow k r_i$ for some constant $k > 0$.
