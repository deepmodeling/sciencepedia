The provided parameters, while representing a case of high diffusivity, are not physically impossible and serve to illustrate a critical limitation in the process. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. It is free from ambiguity, pseudoscience, and logical contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the derivation of the diffusion length expression; second, the numerical calculation; and third, the discussion of feature resolvability.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Diffusion Length**\n\nLet $C(x,t)$ be the concentration of the diffusing acid species as a function of position $x$ and time $t$. The evolution of this concentration profile in one dimension is governed by Fick's second law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe mean-square displacement, $\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle$, of the diffusing particles at time $t$ is defined as the second moment of the concentration distribution. Assuming the total amount of acid is conserved and normalized such that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C(x,t) \\, dx = 1$, the definition is:\n$$\n\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 C(x,t) \\, dx\n$$\nTo find the time evolution of $\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle$, we differentiate this expression with respect to time:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 C(x,t) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\, dx\n$$\nSubstitute Fick's second law into this expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\left( D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\right) \\, dx = D \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\, dx\n$$\nThis integral is evaluated using integration by parts twice. For the first integration, let $u = x^2$ and $dv = \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} dx$.

This leaves:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} \\, dx = -2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\, dx\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral.

The remaining integral is the total normalized concentration, which is $1$.\n$$\n-2 \\left( 0 - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C \\, dx \\right) = -2 ( -1 ) = 2\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the time derivative of the mean-square displacement gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle}{dt} = D \\times 2 = 2D\n$$\nThis is a simple ordinary differential equation. We integrate it with respect to time from $t=0$ to the final bake time $t=\\tau$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\frac{d\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle}{dt} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} 2D \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n\\langle x^2(\\tau) \\rangle - \\langle x^2(0) \\rangle = 2D\\tau\n$$\nAssuming the diffusion starts from a perfectly sharp aerial image edge at $t=0$, the initial displacement is zero, so $\\langle x^2(0) \\rangle = 0$. This yields the mean-square displacement after time $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\langle x^2(\\tau) \\rangle = 2D\\tau\n$$\nThe problem defines the characteristic lateral diffusion length, $L_{diff}$, as the root-mean-square (RMS) displacement. Therefore:\n$$\nL_{diff} = \\sqrt{\\langle x^2(\\tau) \\rangle} = \\sqrt{2D\\tau}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the diffusion coefficient $D = 1.5 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$ and the bake time $\\tau = 60\\ \\mathrm{s}$.

The calculated diffusion length, $L_{diff} \\approx 420\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, represents the characteristic standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the Gaussian blur applied to the initial acid concentration profile.\n\nThe target feature is a line-space pattern with a half-pitch of $40\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. This means both the lines and the spaces are nominally $40\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ wide. For a pattern to be resolved, any blurring length scale must be substantially smaller than the critical dimension of the feature itself. A common rule dictates that the blur should be, at most, a small fraction (e.g., $1/5$ to $1/3$) of the feature size.\n\nIn this case, the diffusion length ($420\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) is more than an order of magnitude larger than the half-pitch ($40\\ \\mathrm{nm}$).\n$$\n\\frac{L_{diff}}{\\text{half-pitch}} = \\frac{420\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{40\\ \\mathrm{nm}} \\approx 10.5\n$$\nSuch extensive diffusion will cause the acid generated within the exposed \"line\" regions to spread far into the unexposed \"space\" regions. The acid concentration profiles from adjacent lines will overlap almost completely, obliterating the concentration difference (modulation) between line and space centers. Since the deprotection reaction necessary for development depends on the local acid concentration, the resulting latent image in the resist will be essentially uniform. Consequently, the developer will not be able to differentiate between lines and spaces, and the pattern will be completely unresolved.

The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution requires combining the formula for capillary force with the formula for beam deflection. The resist line is modeled as a vertical cantilever beam fixed to the substrate. Its length is the line height, so the beam length is $l_{\\text{beam}} = t$. The capillary force is simplified to a single point load, $F_{\\text{cap}}$, applied at the free end of the beam, which is its top edge at height $t$.\n\nThe magnitude of the capillary force, $F_{\\text{cap}}$, must be determined. The problem describes a meniscus bridging adjacent lines. A standard and robust model for the total attractive force between two parallel lines of length $L$ joined by a liquid bridge with surface tension $\\gamma$ derives from the surface energy of the liquid film. A thin liquid film has two liquid-air surfaces, yielding an effective line tension of $2\\gamma$. The total force is this effective line tension multiplied by the length $L$ over which it acts:\n$$F_{\\text{cap}} = 2 \\gamma L$$\nThis model is consistent with the problem's hint to consider \"two liquid–air interfaces\" if these are interpreted as the two surfaces of the liquid sheet forming the bridge.

The parameter $E$ is the Young's modulus, and $I$ is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. The cross-section is a rectangle with dimensions $L \\times w$. The beam bends \"laterally,\" meaning in the direction of its width $w$. The neutral axis for this bending is therefore parallel to the dimension $L$. The second moment of area for a rectangular cross-section with base $b$ and height $h$, for bending about an axis through the centroid parallel to the base, is $I = \\frac{b h^{3}}{12}$.
