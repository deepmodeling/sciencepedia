The assumptions simplify the system to a solvable mathematical form.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on established principles of transport phenomena and surface chemistry. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core principle governing the functionalization process is the surface mass balance, which states that the rate of change of the surface concentration of bound amines, $\\Gamma(t)$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$), is equal to the molar flux of amines from the bulk to the surface, $J$.\n$$ \\frac{d\\Gamma}{dt} = J $$\nThe surface concentration $\\Gamma(t)$ is related to the fractional coverage $\\theta(t)$ and the maximum site density. The maximum site density is given as a number of sites per unit area, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. To convert this to a molar basis, $\\Gamma_{\\max}$, we divide by Avogadro's number, $N_A$.\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{N_A} $$\nThe instantaneous surface concentration is then:\n$$ \\Gamma(t) = \\theta(t) \\Gamma_{\\max} = \\theta(t) \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{N_A} $$\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to time $t$ gives the rate of accumulation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Gamma}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{N_A} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} $$\nThe flux $J$ is described by film theory: $J = k_m(C_b - C_s)$. The problem states that the process is diffusion-limited. This is a crucial condition which implies that the rate of the surface reaction is much faster than the rate of mass transport to the surface. Consequently, any amine molecule arriving at the interface is consumed almost instantaneously, leading to a near-zero interfacial concentration, $C_s \\approx 0$. The flux thus simplifies to its maximum possible value under these conditions:\n$$ J \\approx k_m C_b $$\nWe can now equate the rate of accumulation with the flux to form the governing differential equation for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{N_A} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_m C_b $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. Since $k_m$, $C_b$, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, and $N_A$ are all constants, the equation describes a zero-order process where the rate of change of coverage is constant. We can separate variables to solve for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$ d\\theta = \\left( \\frac{N_A k_m C_b}{\\sigma_{\\max}} \\right) dt $$\nWe integrate this equation with the initial condition that at $t=0$, the surface is unreacted, so $\\theta(0)=0$. We integrate from $t'=0$ to $t$ and from $\\theta'=0$ to $\\theta$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\theta} d\\theta' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left( \\frac{N_A k_m C_b}{\\sigma_{\\max}} \\right) dt' $$\n$$ \\theta(t) = \\left( \\frac{N_A k_m C_b}{\\sigma_{\\max}} \\right) t $$\nThis linear relationship is the governing relation for $\\theta(t)$ under diffusion-limited conditions. To find the time required to reach a specific fractional coverage, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\theta \\cdot \\sigma_{\\max}}{N_A k_m C_b} $$\nWe are asked to compute the time to reach $\\theta = 0.5$.

The kinetic model requested (mass-action for parallel pathways) is a standard approach in chemical kinetics. The provided numerical parameters are physically plausible for the described system at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides all necessary information for deriving a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe rate of change of the surface coverage, $\\theta(t)$, is a result of two independent, parallel reaction pathways leading to desorption. The overall rate of loss of coverage is the sum of the rates of the individual pathways. The problem specifies that the elementary steps follow mass-action kinetics, being first order in surface coverage and first order in the respective oxidant concentration.\n\nLet $R$ be the rate of loss of surface coverage. The rate of change of coverage, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, is then equal to $-R$.\nThe total rate of loss $R$ is the sum of the rate due to oxygen, $R_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, and the rate due to hydroperoxides, $R_{\\mathrm{ROOH}}$:\n$$R = R_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + R_{\\mathrm{ROOH}}$$\nAccording to mass-action kinetics, the rate for each pathway is proportional to the product of the concentration of the reactants. For the surface reaction, the \"concentration\" of the SAM is represented by its fractional coverage $\\theta$.\nThe rate for the oxygen-mediated pathway is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} [\\mathrm{O_2}] \\theta$$\nThe rate for the hydroperoxide-mediated pathway is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} = k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} [\\mathrm{ROOH}] \\theta$$\nThe total rate of change of surface coverage is therefore expressed by the following differential equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(R_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + R_{\\mathrm{ROOH}}) = -(k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} [\\mathrm{O_2}] \\theta + k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} [\\mathrm{ROOH}] \\theta)$$\nFactoring out the surface coverage $\\theta$ yields the required rate law:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} [\\mathrm{O_2}] + k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} [\\mathrm{ROOH}]) \\theta$$\nThis is a pseudo-first-order rate law. We define an effective first-order rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, as:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} [\\mathrm{O_2}] + k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} [\\mathrm{ROOH}]$$\nThe rate law simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\theta$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To find $\\theta(t)$, we separate variables and integrate:\n$$\\int_{\\theta(0)}^{\\theta(t)} \\frac{1}{\\theta'} \\mathrm{d}\\theta' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\mathrm{d}t'$$\nWith the given initial condition $\\theta(0)=1$, the integration yields:\n$$[\\ln(\\theta')]_{1}^{\\theta(t)} = -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} [t']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(\\theta(t)) - \\ln(1) = -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t$$\n$$\\ln(\\theta(t)) = -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the time evolution of the surface coverage:\n$$\\theta(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t)$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which the coverage decays to half of its initial value, i.e., $\\theta(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{\\theta(0)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\theta(t)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_{\\mathrm{eff}} t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for the half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} [\\mathrm{O_2}] + k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} [\\mathrm{ROOH}]}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\nGiven:\n- $[\\mathrm{O_2}] = 2.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n- $[\\mathrm{ROOH}] = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} = 2.0\\times 10^{1}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the contribution from each pathway to the effective rate constant:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{O_2}} [\\mathrm{O_2}] = (5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (2.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{ROOH}} [\\mathrm{ROOH}] = (2.0\\times 10^{1}\\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 10.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThe effective rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the sum of these two terms:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) = 1.01 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nNow, compute the half-life in seconds:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.01 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$t_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{1.01 \\times 10^{-4}}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 6862.84\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in hours.
