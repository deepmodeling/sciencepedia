A common definition compares thermocapillary driving to viscous and thermal diffusion effects. The thermocapillary stress at the free surface is $\\tau_{\\gamma} \\sim |\\mathrm{d}\\gamma/\\mathrm{d}T|(\\Delta T/L)$.

This implies that the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the hydrodynamic boundary layer.\n- $Ma = 1.23 \\times 10^{3}$: Since $Ma \\gg 1$, thermocapillary forces (due to surface tension gradients) are the overwhelmingly dominant driving mechanism for the melt pool flow, far outweighing the dissipative effects of viscosity and thermal diffusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n42.0 & 2.50 \\times 10^{2} & 0.168 & 1.23 \\times 10^{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2467419"}, {"introduction": "As the laser-induced melt pool cools, it solidifies to form the final material, but the extreme cooling rates characteristic of additive manufacturing are far from the slow, equilibrium conditions assumed in traditional metallurgy.

It is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The data provided are physically realistic for nickel-based alloys. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we address the concept of the mushy-zone width, also known as the solidification range, $\\Delta T$. This quantity is defined as the difference between the liquidus temperature $T_l$ and the solidus temperature $T_s$. A larger $\\Delta T$ is generally associated with a higher susceptibility to hot cracking because it represents a larger temperature interval over which a fragile, semi-solid structure exists. For a given composition $C$, the solidification range is:\n$$ \\Delta T(C) = T_{l}(C) - T_{s}(C) $$\nWe are asked to compute this value at the nominal composition $C_0$ for each alloy.\n\nFor Alloy A:\n$$ \\Delta T_A(C_0) = T_{l,A}(C_0) - T_{s,A}(C_0) = 1688\\ \\text{K} - 1618\\ \\text{K} = 70\\ \\text{K} $$\nFor Alloy B:\n$$ \\Delta T_B(C_0) = T_{l,B}(C_0) - T_{s,B}(C_0) = 1720\\ \\text{K} - 1680\\ \\text{K} = 40\\ \\text{K} $$\n\nNext, we must derive a scalar susceptibility index $S$. The problem states that this index must increase with both the mushy-zone width, $\\Delta T(C_0)$, and the sensitivity of this width to compositional fluctuations. Such fluctuations are inherent to solidification due to microsegregation, where the solute is partitioned between the solid and liquid phases. The sensitivity of the mushy-zone width to composition is quantified by its derivative with respect to composition, $\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dC}$.\nUsing the definition of $\\Delta T(C)$, we find its derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC}(T_l(C) - T_s(C)) = \\frac{dT_l}{dC} - \\frac{dT_s}{dC} $$\nThe problem requires an index that increases with this sensitivity. The magnitude of this effect is what matters for susceptibility, not its sign. A large change in $\\Delta T$ for a small change in $C$, regardless of direction, indicates high sensitivity. Therefore, we use the absolute value of the derivative, evaluated at the nominal composition $C_0$:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\left| \\left.\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} \\right| = \\left| \\left.\\frac{dT_l}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} - \\left.\\frac{dT_s}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} \\right| $$\nThe simplest functional form for an index $S$ that increases with two quantities, say $X$ and $Y$, is their product, $S = X \\cdot Y$. We therefore define the hot-cracking susceptibility index $S$ as the product of the solidification range at the nominal composition and the magnitude of the sensitivity of the solidification range to composition:\n$$ S = \\Delta T(C_0) \\times \\left| \\left.\\frac{dT_l}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} - \\left.\\frac{dT_s}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} \\right| $$\nNow, we evaluate this index for each alloy.\n\nFor Alloy A:\nThe sensitivity term is:\n$$ \\left| \\left.\\frac{dT_{l,A}}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} - \\left.\\frac{dT_{s,A}}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} \\right| = \\left| -4.5 - (-0.8) \\right|\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} = \\left| -3.7 \\right|\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} = 3.7\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} $$\nThe susceptibility index for Alloy A is:\n$$ S_A = \\Delta T_A(C_0) \\times 3.7\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} = (70\\ \\text{K}) \\times (3.7\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1}) = 259\\ \\text{K}^2\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} $$\n\nFor Alloy B:\nThe sensitivity term is:\n$$ \\left| \\left.\\frac{dT_{l,B}}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} - \\left.\\frac{dT_{s,B}}{dC}\\right|_{C_0} \\right| = \\left| -2.2 - (-1.5) \\right|\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} = \\left| -0.7 \\right|\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} = 0.7\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} $$\nThe susceptibility index for Alloy B is:\n$$ S_B = \\Delta T_B(C_0) \\times 0.7\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} = (40\\ \\text{K}) \\times (0.7\\ \\text{K}\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1}) = 28\\ \\text{K}^2\\,(\\text{wt\\%})^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we rank the alloys and compute the required ratio.\nComparing the indices, $S_A = 259$ and $S_B = 28$, we find that $S_A > S_B$. This indicates that Alloy A has a substantially higher predicted susceptibility to hot cracking than Alloy B. This is physically consistent, as Alloy A exhibits both a wider mushy zone and a greater sensitivity of this zone's width to compositional changes.\n\nThe ratio of the Alloy A index to the Alloy B index is:\n$$ \\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \\frac{259}{28} = 9.25 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{S_A}{S_B} = 9.250 $$\nThis ratio is a dimensionless quantity as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.250}$$", "id": "2467417"}]}
