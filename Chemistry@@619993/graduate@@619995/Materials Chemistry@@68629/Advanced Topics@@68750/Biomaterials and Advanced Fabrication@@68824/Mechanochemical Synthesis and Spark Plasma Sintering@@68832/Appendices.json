Consider a single milling jar of inner radius $R = 50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ mounted in a planetary configuration, where the jar’s own rotation frequency about its axis is $f$. For purposes of this calculation, assume the following idealized model that isolates the dominant kinematics of ball–wall impacts in a well-filled jar:\n1) the instantaneous tangential speed of the jar wall relative to the jar frame at the point of impact is $v = 2\\pi f R$,\n2) each impact is characterized by a normal approach speed equal in magnitude to $v$, so that the kinetic energy available per impact scales as $E_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\propto \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2}$ for a representative ball of mass $m$, and\n3) the impact frequency per ball scales linearly with the jar rotation frequency, $\\nu \\propto f$, under constant filling, ball size, and frictional conditions.\n\nStarting only from kinematics of circular motion and the definition of kinetic energy, use the model above to:\n(a) determine the tangential speed at $f = 20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, and\n(b) quantify how changing the jar rotation frequency from $f_{1} = 20\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ to $f_{2} = 25\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ affects both the impact energy and the impact frequency.

All necessary data and relationships are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The specified parameters are realistic for laboratory-scale equipment. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, we address part (a) to find the tangential speed at the initial frequency. Then, we derive the general scaling relationship for mechanical power input, and finally compute the required ratio for part (b).\n\nPart (a): Tangential Speed Calculation\nThe tangential speed $v$ of the jar wall is given by the kinematic relation for circular motion, $v = 2\\pi f R$.

Without multi-peak data to construct a Williamson–Hall or Warren–Averbach analysis, attributing all specimen broadening to size will overestimate $\\beta_{\\mathrm{size}}$ and therefore underestimate $D$. For example, for a typical mechanochemical microstrain in the range $\\varepsilon \\sim 10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$, the term $4\\,\\varepsilon\\,\\tan\\theta$ at $\\theta=20^{\\circ}$ contributes on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ radians, which can be comparable to the size broadening estimated above. To decouple size and strain rigorously, one needs the breadths of multiple reflections at different $2\\theta$ (to exploit the distinct $\\tan\\theta$ dependence of strain) and a calibrated instrumental function; optionally, Fourier-based line profile analysis can separate coherent domain size from distortion. In the present single-peak estimate, $D \\approx 17.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ should be regarded as an apparent crystallite size and a lower bound on the true size if microstrain is significant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.4}$$", "id": "2499376"}, {"introduction": "This exercise connects the synthesis and consolidation stages, demonstrating how compositional changes during milling—including common real-world contamination—impact the final phase makeup after Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) [@problem_id:2499351].
