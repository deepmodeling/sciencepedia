It describes a simplified but physically reasonable model of burst drug release from a polymer matrix, based on fundamental principles of mass transport and phase equilibrium. All necessary parameters are provided, and the task is to derive and calculate a specific physical quantity. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the initial burst fraction, which we denote as $F_{burst}$. This fraction is defined as the ratio of the mass of drug released instantaneously, $M_{burst}$, to the total initial mass of drug in the polymer film, $M_{total}$.\n$$F_{burst} = \\frac{M_{burst}}{M_{total}}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the total initial mass of the drug, $M_{total}$. Let the planar area of the film be $A$. The film has a uniform thickness $L$. The volume of the film is therefore $V_{film} = A \\cdot L$. The initial drug concentration throughout the polymer is given as $C_{p,0}$. Thus, the total initial mass is:\n$$M_{total} = C_{p,0} V_{film} = C_{p,0} A L$$\n\nNext, we determine the mass released during the initial burst, $M_{burst}$. According to the problem statement, this release originates exclusively from an interfacial polymer layer of thickness $\\delta$. The volume of this layer is $V_{\\delta} = A \\cdot \\delta$. The initial mass of drug contained within this layer is:\n$$M_{\\delta, initial} = C_{p,0} V_{\\delta} = C_{p,0} A \\delta$$\n\nAt time $t=0$, this interfacial layer rapidly equilibrates with the adjacent aqueous sink. The drug concentration in the aqueous phase at the interface, $C_{w,eq}$, is limited by the drug's aqueous solubility, $S$. Given the sink condition, the concentration will reach this maximum value, so $C_{w,eq} = S$.\n\nThe polymer-water partition coefficient, $K_{pw}$, is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations in the polymer and water phases at the interface:\n$$K_{pw} = \\frac{C_{p,eq}}{C_{w,eq}}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can find the equilibrium concentration of the drug that remains in the polymer at the interface, $C_{p,eq}$. Substituting $C_{w,eq} = S$, we obtain:\n$$C_{p,eq} = K_{pw} C_{w,eq} = K_{pw} S$$\n\nThe problem states that the entire interfacial layer of thickness $\\delta$ achieves this local equilibrium concentration. Therefore, the mass of drug remaining in the interfacial layer after the instantaneous equilibration is:\n$$M_{\\delta, final} = C_{p,eq} V_{\\delta} = (K_{pw} S) (A \\delta)$$\n\nThe mass of drug released in the burst, $M_{burst}$, is the mass lost from this interfacial layer. This is the difference between the initial mass in the layer and the final mass remaining in the layer. This is a direct application of the principle of conservation of mass.\n$$M_{burst} = M_{\\delta, initial} - M_{\\delta, final} = C_{p,0} A \\delta - (K_{pw} S) A \\delta$$\n$$M_{burst} = (C_{p,0} - K_{pw} S) A \\delta$$\nThis expression is valid only if $C_{p,0}  K_{pw} S$, which means the initial concentration is supersaturated with respect to the interfacial equilibrium condition. If $C_{p,0} \\leq K_{pw} S$, there would be no burst release, and $M_{burst}$ would be zero.\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the burst fraction, $F_{burst}$:\n$$F_{burst} = \\frac{M_{burst}}{M_{total}} = \\frac{(C_{p,0} - K_{pw} S) A \\delta}{C_{p,0} A L}$$\nThe area $A$ cancels, as expected for a problem defined by one-dimensional transport through a planar film.

We establish a one-dimensional coordinate system $x$, where the core extends from $x=0$ to $x=a$ and the barrier from $x=a$ to $x=a+L$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. At $x=0$, the concentration is maintained at the initial core concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(0) = C_{0,i}$.\n2. At the core-barrier interface, $x=a$, concentrations are related by the partition coefficient, $C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a) = K_i C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a)$.\n3. At the outer surface of the barrier, $x=a+L$, the concentration is zero due to the perfect sink condition, $C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a+L) = 0$.\n\nUnder quasi-steady state, the flux $J_i$ is constant throughout the composite slab. For a linear concentration profile in each layer, the flux can be expressed as:\nIn the core layer ($0  x  a$): $J_i = -D_{\\mathrm{c},i} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a) - C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(0)}{a} = -D_{\\mathrm{c},i} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a) - C_{0,i}}{a}$.\nIn the barrier layer ($a  x  a+L$): $J_i = -D_{\\mathrm{b},i} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a+L) - C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a)}{L} = -D_{\\mathrm{b},i} \\frac{0 - C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a)}{L} = D_{\\mathrm{b},i} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a)}{L}$.\n\nUsing the partition condition $C_{\\mathrm{b},i}(a) = K_i C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a)$, the flux expression for the barrier becomes:\n$J_i = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{b},i} K_i C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a)}{L}$, which implies $C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a) = \\frac{J_i L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}}$.\n\nWe substitute this expression for the unknown interface concentration $C_{\\mathrm{c},i}(a)$ back into the flux equation for the core:\n$J_i = -D_{\\mathrm{c},i} \\frac{\\frac{J_i L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}} - C_{0,i}}{a}$\n$J_i a = -D_{\\mathrm{c},i} \\left( \\frac{J_i L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}} - C_{0,i} \\right)$\n$J_i a = -\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{c},i} L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}} J_i + D_{\\mathrm{c},i} C_{0,i}$\n$J_i \\left( a + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{c},i} L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}} \\right) = D_{\\mathrm{c},i} C_{0,i}$\nSolving for the flux $J_i$:\n$J_i = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{c},i} C_{0,i}}{a + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{c},i} L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}}} = \\frac{C_{0,i}}{\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},i}} + \\frac{L}{K_i D_{\\mathrm{b},i}}}$\n\nThis expression represents the flux as the driving concentration difference ($C_{0,i} - 0$) divided by the sum of the mass transport resistances of the two layers.

The ratio of the fluxes $R(L)$ is given by:\n$R(L) = \\frac{J_B(L)}{J_A(L)} = \\frac{C_{0} / \\left(\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} + \\frac{L}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}}\\right)}{C_{0} / \\left(\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}} + \\frac{L}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}} + \\frac{L}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}}}{\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} + \\frac{L}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}}}$\n\nWe are required to find the barrier thickness $L^{\\star}$ for which this ratio equals $R^{\\star} = 3.00$.\n$R^{\\star} = \\frac{\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}} + \\frac{L^{\\star}}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}}}{\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} + \\frac{L^{\\star}}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $L^{\\star}$:\n$R^{\\star} \\left(\\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} + \\frac{L^{\\star}}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}}\\right) = \\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}} + \\frac{L^{\\star}}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}}$\n$L^{\\star} \\left(\\frac{1}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}} - \\frac{R^{\\star}}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}}\\right) = \\frac{R^{\\star} a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} - \\frac{a}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}}$\n$L^{\\star} = a \\frac{\\frac{R^{\\star}}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} - \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}}}{\\frac{1}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}} - \\frac{R^{\\star}}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}}}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\n$a = 30 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}$\n$R^{\\star} = 3.00$\nParameters for drug $A$: $D_{\\mathrm{c},A} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $D_{\\mathrm{b},A} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-16}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $K_A = 0.20$.\nParameters for drug $B$: $D_{\\mathrm{c},B} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $D_{\\mathrm{b},B} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $K_B = 5.0$.\n\nCalculate the numerator term in the fraction:\n$\\frac{R^{\\star}}{D_{\\mathrm{c},B}} - \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{c},A}} = \\frac{3.00}{2.0 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}} - \\frac{1}{2.0 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}$\n$= 1.5 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2 - 0.05 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2 = 1.45 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nCalculate the denominator term in the fraction:\n$\\frac{1}{K_A D_{\\mathrm{b},A}} - \\frac{R^{\\star}}{K_B D_{\\mathrm{b},B}} = \\frac{1}{(0.20)(5.0 \\times 10^{-16}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s})} - \\frac{3.00}{(5.0)(1.0 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s})}$\n$= \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-16}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}} - \\frac{3.00}{5.0 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}$\n$= 1.0 \\times 10^{16}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2 - 0.6 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2 = 10 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2 - 0.6 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2 = 9.4 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nNow, calculate $L^{\\star}$:\n$L^{\\star} = (30 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}) \\frac{1.45 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2}{9.4 \\times 10^{15}~\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{m}^2} = (30 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}) \\frac{1.45}{9.4}$\n$L^{\\star} \\approx 4.627659... \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}$\n$L^{\\star} \\approx 4.627659...~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in micrometers, rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$L^{\\star} \\approx 4.63~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.63}$$", "id": "2482182"}]}
