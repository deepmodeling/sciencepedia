It is a standard, well-posed problem in physical chemistry and materials science, grounded in the fundamental principles of the kinetic theory of gases. All necessary data and constants are provided, and the parameters are physically realistic for an ultra-high vacuum environment. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity. We will therefore proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe first step is to derive the molecular impingement rate, $J$, which represents the number of molecules striking a unit area of a surface per unit time. We begin from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities.\n\nLet the surface lie in the $xy$-plane. The gas molecules are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$, and their velocity distribution is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function, $f(v_x, v_y, v_z)$:\n$$ f(v_x, v_y, v_z) = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2 k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of a single molecule and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe number of molecules per unit volume with velocity components between $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ and $(v_x+dv_x, v_y+dv_y, v_z+dv_z)$ is given by $n f(v_x, v_y, v_z) dv_x dv_y dv_z$, where $n$ is the total number density of molecules.\n\nThe flux of molecules moving towards the surface (i.e., with velocity component $v_z > 0$) is found by integrating the product of the velocity component normal to the surface, $v_z$, and the number of molecules per unit volume over all possible velocities for which $v_z > 0$.\nThe impingement rate $J$ is thus given by the integral:\n$$ J = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_y \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dv_z \\, (n v_z) f(v_x, v_y, v_z) $$\nSubstituting the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, we get:\n$$ J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m v_z^2}{2 k_B T}\\right) dv_z \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m v_x^2}{2 k_B T}\\right) dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m v_y^2}{2 k_B T}\\right) dv_y $$\nThe integrals over $v_x$ and $v_y$ are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$.

The provided numerical values are physically realistic for typical MBE growth processes. No inconsistencies, ambiguities, or logical flaws are detected. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the quantitative relation between the oscillation period, $T_{\\mathrm{osc}}$, and the monolayer growth rate, $R$.\nThe growth rate, $R$, is defined as the number of monolayers deposited per unit time. By definition (i), the surface coverage, $\\theta(t)$, which is measured in monolayers, increases linearly with time, $t$. Assuming growth commences at $t=0$ from a completed layer where $\\theta(0)=0$, this linear relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = R \\cdot t\n$$\nHere, $R$ is the constant of proportionality, which is the growth rate in units of monolayers per second.\n\nBy definition (ii), a RHEED intensity maximum is observed upon the completion of each successive monolayer. This corresponds to times $t_n$ when the coverage $\\theta(t_n)$ reaches an integer value $n$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n$$\n\\theta(t_n) = n\n$$\nCombining these two equations gives a relation for the time $t_n$ required to grow $n$ complete monolayers:\n$$\nR \\cdot t_n = n \\implies t_n = \\frac{n}{R}\n$$\nThe period of one RHEED oscillation, $T_{\\mathrm{osc}}$, is the time elapsed between two consecutive intensity maxima. This corresponds to the time required to grow a single monolayer, from layer $n-1$ to layer $n$. We can calculate this period as the difference between the times of consecutive maxima, $t_n$ and $t_{n-1}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{osc}} = t_n - t_{n-1} = \\frac{n}{R} - \\frac{n-1}{R}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{osc}} = \\frac{n - (n-1)}{R} = \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\nThus, the growth rate $R$ is the reciprocal of the oscillation period $T_{\\mathrm{osc}}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{osc}}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nSecond, we compute the best estimate of $R$ and its standard uncertainty $u_R$.\nThe best estimate for the growth rate $R$ is obtained by using the given mean value of the oscillation period, $T_{\\mathrm{osc}} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{3.0\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 0.3333\\dots\\ \\text{monolayers/s}\n$$\nTo find the standard uncertainty $u_R$, we apply the formula for first-order uncertainty propagation for a function of a single variable, $R(T_{\\mathrm{osc}})$. The general formula is $u_R \\approx |\\frac{dR}{dT_{\\mathrm{osc}}}| u_T$.\nWe must first compute the derivative of $R$ with respect to $T_{\\mathrm{osc}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dT_{\\mathrm{osc}}} = \\frac{d}{dT_{\\mathrm{osc}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{osc}}} \\right) = - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2}\n$$\nThe uncertainty $u_R$ is then given by:\n$$\nu_R = \\left| - \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2} \\right| u_T = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2} u_T\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values $T_{\\mathrm{osc}} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$ and $u_T = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n$$\nu_R = \\frac{1}{(3.0\\ \\mathrm{s})^2} (0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}) = \\frac{0.10}{9.0}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.01111\\dots\\ \\text{monolayers/s}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding both $R$ and $u_R$ to three significant figures.\nThe best estimate for the growth rate is:\n$$\nR \\approx 0.333\\ \\text{monolayers/s}\n$$\nThe standard uncertainty in the growth rate is:\n$$\nu_R \\approx 0.0111\\ \\text{monolayers/s}\n$$\nThe final result is the pair $(R, u_R) = (0.333, 0.0111)$, with units of monolayers per second implied.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.333  0.0111 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2501143"}, {"introduction": "Beyond growing pure crystals, the true power of MBE lies in engineering materials with specific functionalities, such as in semiconductors.
