The analysis will be based on the provided assumptions: bending-dominated deformation and plastic yielding in bending as the collapse mechanism. The derivation for the monolithic case will establish the foundational scaling relationships, which will then be applied recursively to solve the hierarchical case.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the relative density $r$ and the geometric parameters of the foam struts, which are their length $l$ and thickness $t$. The relative density $r$ is defined as the ratio of the foam density $\\rho^{\\ast}$ to the solid density $\\rho_s$, which is equivalent to the volume fraction of the solid material.\n$r = \\frac{\\rho^{\\ast}}{\\rho_s} = \\frac{V_{\\text{solid}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$\nThe volume of the struts in a representative unit cell of the foam is proportional to the total length of the struts multiplied by their cross-sectional area, $A \\propto t^2$. The total volume of the unit cell is proportional to $l^3$. The total length of struts within a unit cell of side length $l$ is itself proportional to $l$. Thus, $V_{\\text{solid}} \\propto l \\cdot t^2$. The total volume is $V_{\\text{total}} \\propto l^3$.\nThe relative density therefore scales as:\n$$r \\propto \\frac{l t^2}{l^3} = \\left(\\frac{t}{l}\\right)^2$$\nThis fundamental geometric relationship implies that the strut aspect ratio scales with the square root of the relative density:\n$$\\frac{t}{l} \\propto r^{1/2}$$\n\nPart 1: Monolithic Foam\n\nWe derive the scaling exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for the monolithic foam.\n\nDerivation of the Young's Modulus Scaling ($E/E_s \\sim r^{\\alpha}$):\nThe macroscopic Young's modulus $E$ is the ratio of macroscopic stress $\\sigma_{foam}$ to macroscopic strain $\\epsilon_{foam}$. When the foam is subjected to a stress $\\sigma_{foam}$, the forces on the individual struts are proportional to this stress and the square of the cell size, $F \\propto \\sigma_{foam} l^2$.\nSince the deformation is bending-dominated, the deflection $\\delta$ of a strut of length $l$ under a load $F$ is given by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory:\n$$\\delta \\propto \\frac{F l^3}{E_s I}$$\nwhere $E_s$ is the Young's modulus of the solid material and $I$ is the second moment of area of the strut's cross-section. For a square cross-section of thickness $t$, $I \\propto t^4$.\nThe macroscopic strain in the foam is proportional to the strut deflection normalized by the strut length, $\\epsilon_{foam} \\propto \\delta/l$.\nCombining these relations gives:\n$$\\epsilon_{foam} \\propto \\frac{\\delta}{l} \\propto \\frac{F l^2}{E_s I} \\propto \\frac{(\\sigma_{foam} l^2) l^2}{E_s t^4} = \\sigma_{foam} \\frac{l^4}{E_s t^4}$$\nThe effective modulus $E = \\sigma_{foam}/\\epsilon_{foam}$ is then:\n$$E = \\frac{\\sigma_{foam}}{\\epsilon_{foam}} \\propto E_s \\left(\\frac{t}{l}\\right)^4$$\nSubstituting the geometric relation $(t/l) \\propto r^{1/2}$:\n$$E \\propto E_s (r^{1/2})^4 = E_s r^2$$\nThus, the scaling relation is $E/E_s \\propto r^2$, and the exponent is $\\alpha = 2$.\n\nDerivation of the Plastic Collapse Strength Scaling ($\\sigma/\\sigma_s \\sim r^{\\beta}$):\nPlastic collapse occurs when the maximum stress in a strut reaches the yield strength of the solid, $\\sigma_s$. The maximum stress in a bent beam occurs at the outer surface and is given by $\\sigma_{max} = My/I$, where $M$ is the bending moment, $y$ is the distance from the neutral axis, and $I$ is the second moment of area.\nThe bending moment is proportional to the applied force and strut length, $M \\propto F l$. The distance $y$ is proportional to the thickness, $y \\propto t$. As before, $I \\propto t^4$.\nThe force $F$ in the strut is related to the macroscopic foam stress $\\sigma_{foam}$ by $F \\propto \\sigma_{foam} l^2$.\nThe maximum stress in the strut is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_{max} \\propto \\frac{(F l) t}{I} \\propto \\frac{(\\sigma_{foam} l^2) l t}{t^4} = \\sigma_{foam} \\frac{l^3}{t^3}$$\nCollapse occurs when $\\sigma_{max}$ reaches $\\sigma_s$, which defines the macroscopic collapse strength, which we denote as $\\sigma$.\n$$\\sigma_s \\propto \\sigma \\left(\\frac{l}{t}\\right)^3$$\nRearranging for the macroscopic collapse strength $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_s \\left(\\frac{t}{l}\\right)^3$$\nSubstituting the geometric relation $(t/l) \\propto r^{1/2}$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_s (r^{1/2})^3 = \\sigma_s r^{3/2}$$\nThus, the scaling relation is $\\sigma/\\sigma_s \\propto r^{3/2}$, and the exponent is $\\beta = 3/2$.\n\nPart 2: Hierarchical Foam\n\nNow we analyze the two-level hierarchical structure. The macro-struts are themselves open-cell foams (micro-foam).\nLet the properties of the solid be $E_s, \\sigma_s, \\rho_s$.\nLet the properties of the micro-foam (which constitutes the macro-struts) be $E_m, \\sigma_m, \\rho_m$. The relative density of this micro-foam with respect to the solid is $\\eta = \\rho_m/\\rho_s$.\nLet the properties of the final hierarchical foam be $E, \\sigma, \\rho^{\\ast}$. The relative density of this macro-foam with respect to its constituent micro-foam material is $\\lambda = \\rho^{\\ast}/\\rho_m$.\nThe total relative density is $r = \\rho^{\\ast}/\\rho_s = (\\rho^{\\ast}/\\rho_m) (\\rho_m/\\rho_s) = \\lambda \\eta$.\n\nThe problem states that both levels are bending-dominated. We can therefore apply the scaling laws derived in Part 1 sequentially.\n\nProperties of the Micro-Foam Material (Level 1):\nThe micro-foam is a cellular solid with relative density $\\eta$. Its properties are determined by scaling the solid properties $E_s$ and $\\sigma_s$ using the exponents $\\alpha=2$ and $\\beta=3/2$.\n$$E_m \\propto E_s \\eta^{\\alpha} = E_s \\eta^2$$\n$$\\sigma_m \\propto \\sigma_s \\eta^{\\beta} = \\sigma_s \\eta^{3/2}$$\n\nProperties of the Hierarchical Foam (Level 2):\nThe hierarchical foam is a cellular solid with relative density $\\lambda$ made from a material with properties $E_m$ and $\\sigma_m$. We apply the same scaling laws, but a second time, using $E_m$ and $\\sigma_m$ as the properties of the \"solid\".\nThe effective modulus $E$ of the final structure is:\n$$E \\propto E_m \\lambda^{\\alpha} = E_m \\lambda^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_m$:\n$$E \\propto (E_s \\eta^2) \\lambda^2 = E_s (\\eta \\lambda)^2$$\nSince the total relative density is $r = \\eta\\lambda$, we have:\n$$E \\propto E_s r^2$$\nThis implies that the modified exponent for the Young's modulus is $\\alpha_h = 2$.\n\nThe effective plastic collapse strength $\\sigma$ of the final structure is:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_m \\lambda^{\\beta} = \\sigma_m \\lambda^{3/2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_m$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto (\\sigma_s \\eta^{3/2}) \\lambda^{3/2} = \\sigma_s (\\eta \\lambda)^{3/2}$$\nUsing $r = \\eta\\lambda$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_s r^{3/2}$$\nThis implies that the modified exponent for plastic collapse strength is $\\beta_h = 3/2$.\n\nThe ordered pair of modified exponents is therefore $(\\alpha_h, \\beta_h) = (2, 3/2)$. It is a crucial observation that, under the strict and idealized assumption that both hierarchical levels remain bending-dominated, the scaling exponents for modulus and strength do not change compared to the monolithic case. The modification manifests in the pre-factors, not the exponents.\nThe problem is constructed to test adherence to the given physical model, not to import more complex phenomena like buckling or mode-switching, which are not mentioned and are implicitly excluded by the explicit assumption of bending-dominance at all levels.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & \\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2470316"}, {"introduction": "Creating materials that are both tough and compliant, like cartilage, is a major goal in materials design.
