It is scientifically grounded in the Bernoullian model of stereopolymerization, which is a fundamental concept in materials chemistry. All definitions are precise, and the given information is sufficient and consistent. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe polymerization process is described as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. At each propagation step, a dyad is formed. The dyad can be either meso ($m$) with probability $p_m$ or racemo ($r$) with probability $p_r$.\nThe probability of forming a meso dyad is given as:\n$$ P(m) = p_m $$\nSince there are only two possible outcomes for a dyad configuration, the probability of forming a racemo dyad is:\n$$ P(r) = p_r = 1 - p_m $$\nThe problem stipulates that $0 < p_m < 1$, ensuring neither outcome is impossible nor certain.\n\nFirst, we derive the triad fractions. A triad consists of three successive stereocenters, which are defined by two adjacent dyads. For a long chain where end effects are negligible, the probability of a specific dyad type is independent of the preceding dyad. This is the essence of the Bernoullian model.\n\nThe fraction of $mm$ triads is the probability of observing two consecutive meso dyads. Due to independence, this is:\n$$ P(mm) = P(m, m) = P(m) \\times P(m) = p_m^2 $$\n\nThe fraction of $rr$ triads is the probability of observing two consecutive racemo dyads. This is:\n$$ P(rr) = P(r, r) = P(r) \\times P(r) = (1-p_m)^2 $$\n\nThe heterotactic triad fraction, conventionally denoted $mr$, corresponds to sequences where the two adjacent dyads are different. This includes both the $mr$ sequence (meso followed by racemo) and the $rm$ sequence (racemo followed by meso). The probabilities for these are:\n$$ P(m, r) = P(m) \\times P(r) = p_m (1-p_m) $$\n$$ P(r, m) = P(r) \\times P(m) = (1-p_m) p_m $$\nThe total fraction of heterotactic triads, which we denote as $[mr]$, is the sum of these probabilities:\n$$ [mr] = P(m, r) + P(r, m) = p_m(1-p_m) + (1-p_m)p_m = 2p_m(1-p_m) $$\nWe can verify that these fractions sum to unity:\n$$ P(mm) + [mr] + P(rr) = p_m^2 + 2p_m(1-p_m) + (1-p_m)^2 = p_m^2 + 2p_m - 2p_m^2 + 1 - 2p_m + p_m^2 = 1 $$\n\nNext, we derive the mean length of an $m$-run. An $m$-run is defined as a maximal contiguous sequence of meso dyads. This means a run of $m$-dyads is bounded on both sides by $r$-dyads (or by a chain end, which we ignore). Let the random variable $L_m$ represent the length of an $m$-run. We seek its expectation, $E[L_m]$.\n\nThe formation of the dyad sequence can be viewed as a series of independent trials. Let us define a \"trial\" as the observation of a dyad. Let a \"success\" be the event of observing an $r$-dyad, which terminates a running sequence of $m$-dyads. The probability of success in any single trial is:\n$$ p_{\\text{success}} = P(r) = 1 - p_m $$\nThe event of observing an $m$-dyad is a \"failure\" in this context, as it continues the run.\n\nThe length of the $m$-run, $L_m$, can be modeled using the geometric distribution. Let a random variable $Y$ be the number of trials required to get the first success. The probability mass function is $P(Y=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots$, where $p$ is the probability of success. The expectation of this random variable is $E[Y] = \\frac{1}{p}$.\n\nIn our problem, a \"trial\" is the inspection of the next dyad, given we are in an $m$-run. The \"success\" is the termination of the run upon observation of an $r$-dyad. The probability of success is $p = 1-p_m$. We must relate the random variable $Y$ to the run length $L_m$.\n- If we achieve success on the first trial ($Y=1$), it means the run consists of a single $m$-dyad. The run length $L_m$ is $1$.\n- If we achieve success on the second trial ($Y=2$), it means the first dyad inspected was an $m$-dyad and the second was an $r$-dyad. The run consists of two $m$-dyads. The run length $L_m$ is $2$.\n- In general, if success is achieved on the $k$-th trial ($Y=k$), the sequence of outcomes was $(k-1)$ failures followed by one success. This corresponds to a sequence of $(k-1)$ $m$-dyads followed by one $r$-dyad. The total length of the $m$-run is therefore $k$.\nThus, the random variable for the run length, $L_m$, is identical to the random variable $Y$, the number of trials to first success.\n\nTherefore, the mean $m$-run length, $E[L_m]$, is the expectation of a geometric distribution with success probability $p = 1-p_m$:\n$$ E[L_m] = \\frac{1}{p_{\\text{success}}} = \\frac{1}{1-p_m} $$\nThis expression gives the average number of meso dyads in a maximal contiguous sequence.

It is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to obtain a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nFirst, we express the theoretical triad probabilities in terms of $p_m$ under the Bernoullian assumption. A triad is defined by two consecutive diads. Due to the independence of placements, the probability of a sequence of diads is the product of their individual probabilities.\nThe probability of a meso-meso ($mm$) triad is the probability of two consecutive meso diads:\n$$ P_{mm} = P(m) P(m) = p_m^2 $$\nThe probability of a racemo-racemo ($rr$) triad is the probability of two consecutive racemo diads:\n$$ P_{rr} = P(r) P(r) = p_r^2 = (1 - p_m)^2 $$\nA meso-racemo ($mr$) triad can arise from an $m$ placement followed by an $r$ placement, or an $r$ placement followed by an $m$ placement. These are physically indistinguishable in standard NMR, so their probabilities are summed:\n$$ P_{mr} = P(m)P(r) + P(r)P(m) = 2 p_m p_r = 2 p_m (1 - p_m) $$\nThe sum of these probabilities is $P_{mm} + P_{mr} + P_{rr} = p_m^2 + 2p_m(1-p_m) + (1-p_m)^2 = (p_m + (1-p_m))^2 = 1$, as required.\n\nNext, we derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $p_m$. The observed triad counts are obtained from the given intensities and total count $N$:\n$n_{mm} = N \\times I_{mm} = 2000 \\times 0.65 = 1300$\n$n_{mr} = N \\times I_{mr} = 2000 \\times 0.30 = 600$\n$n_{rr} = N \\times I_{rr} = 2000 \\times 0.05 = 100$\nThe total count is $n_{mm} + n_{mr} + n_{rr} = 1300 + 600 + 100 = 2000 = N$.\n\nThe observation of these counts is a multinomial experiment. The likelihood function $L$ for the parameter $p_m$ given the observed counts is proportional to:\n$$ L(p_m) \\propto (P_{mm})^{n_{mm}} (P_{mr})^{n_{mr}} (P_{rr})^{n_{rr}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities:\n$$ L(p_m) \\propto (p_m^2)^{n_{mm}} [2p_m(1-p_m)]^{n_{mr}} [(1-p_m)^2]^{n_{rr}} $$\nTo simplify maximization, we use the log-likelihood function, $\\ln L$:\n$$ \\ln L(p_m) = K + 2n_{mm} \\ln(p_m) + n_{mr}(\\ln(2) + \\ln(p_m) + \\ln(1-p_m)) + 2n_{rr} \\ln(1-p_m) $$\nwhere $K$ is a constant. Collecting terms dependent on $p_m$:\n$$ \\ln L(p_m) = K' + (2n_{mm} + n_{mr}) \\ln(p_m) + (n_{mr} + 2n_{rr}) \\ln(1-p_m) $$\nTo find the maximum, we differentiate with respect to $p_m$ and set the result to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln L)}{dp_m} = \\frac{2n_{mm} + n_{mr}}{p_m} - \\frac{n_{mr} + 2n_{rr}}{1-p_m} = 0 $$\nSolving for $p_m$, we denote the estimator as $\\hat{p}_m$:\n$$ (2n_{mm} + n_{mr})(1 - \\hat{p}_m) = (n_{mr} + 2n_{rr})\\hat{p}_m $$\n$$ 2n_{mm} + n_{mr} = \\hat{p}_m (2n_{mm} + n_{mr} + n_{mr} + 2n_{rr}) $$\n$$ 2n_{mm} + n_{mr} = \\hat{p}_m [2(n_{mm} + n_{mr} + n_{rr})] = \\hat{p}_m(2N) $$\nThus, the MLE for $p_m$ is:\n$$ \\hat{p}_m = \\frac{2n_{mm} + n_{mr}}{2N} $$\nThis result is intuitive: the estimator for the probability of a meso diad is the observed frequency of meso diads in the sample. A triad contains two diads, so $N$ triads contain $2N$ diads. An $mm$ triad contains two meso diads, and an $mr$ triad contains one meso diad.\n\nNumerically evaluating $\\hat{p}_m$:\n$$ \\hat{p}_m = \\frac{2(1300) + 600}{2(2000)} = \\frac{2600 + 600}{4000} = \\frac{3200}{4000} = 0.8 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $p_m = 0.8000$.\n\nNow we compute the Pearson chi-squared statistic, $\\chi^2$, to test the goodness of fit of the Bernoullian model.\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i \\in \\{mm, mr, rr\\}} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} $$\nThe observed counts ($O_i$) are $n_{mm}=1300$, $n_{mr}=600$, and $n_{rr}=100$.\nThe expected counts ($E_i$) are calculated using the estimated parameter $\\hat{p}_m = 0.8$, so $\\hat{p}_r = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.\n$E_{mm} = N \\times \\hat{P}_{mm} = N \\times (\\hat{p}_m)^2 = 2000 \\times (0.8)^2 = 2000 \\times 0.64 = 1280$\n$E_{mr} = N \\times \\hat{P}_{mr} = N \\times 2\\hat{p}_m(1-\\hat{p}_m) = 2000 \\times 2(0.8)(0.2) = 2000 \\times 0.32 = 640$\n$E_{rr} = N \\times \\hat{P}_{rr} = N \\times (1-\\hat{p}_m)^2 = 2000 \\times (0.2)^2 = 2000 \\times 0.04 = 80$\n\nNow, we calculate the $\\chi^2$ value:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(1300 - 1280)^2}{1280} + \\frac{(600 - 640)^2}{640} + \\frac{(100 - 80)^2}{80} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(20)^2}{1280} + \\frac{(-40)^2}{640} + \\frac{(20)^2}{80} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{400}{1280} + \\frac{1600}{640} + \\frac{400}{80} = 0.3125 + 2.5 + 5.0 = 7.8125 $$\n\nThe problem specifies the degrees of freedom as $\\nu = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$.

It incorrectly assigns the energy of a transition state ($E(120^{\\circ}) = 3.40 \\mathrm{\\ kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$) to the gauche state energy $E_g$. The energies of equilibrium states correspond to potential energy minima, not maxima. The calculation of $\\epsilon_{tg}$ is also arbitrary and nonsensical. The assumption of zero cooperativity penalties is contradicted by the pairwise energy data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD) $E_{t}=0.00$, $E_{g}=0.70$, and a noncooperative model $\\epsilon_{i j}=0$ for all pairs $i,j$ (all in $\\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$).\nThis option correctly determines the single-bond energies $E_t$ and $E_g$. However, it proposes a noncooperative model ($\\epsilon_{ij}=0$), which implies that the pairwise energies should be simple sums of the single-bond energies (e.g., $E_{\\text{pair}}(t,g) = E_t + E_g = 0.70 \\mathrm{\\ kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$). This contradicts the provided data, where $E_{\\text{pair}}(t,g) = 0.72 \\mathrm{\\ kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$. The discrepancies are even larger for $gg$ pairs. The provided data explicitly requires non-zero cooperativity terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A is consistent with a correct application of the Rotational Isomeric State model to the provided data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472254"}]}
