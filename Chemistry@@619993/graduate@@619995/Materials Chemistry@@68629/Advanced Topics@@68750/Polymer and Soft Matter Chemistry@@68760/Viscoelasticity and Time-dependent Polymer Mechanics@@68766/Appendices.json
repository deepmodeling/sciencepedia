It is a valid problem in materials chemistry, specifically in the topic of viscoelasticity. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ in the Maxwell element is the sum of the strain in the spring, $\\epsilon_s(t)$, and the strain in the dashpot, $\\epsilon_d(t)$:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_s(t) + \\epsilon_d(t)\n$$\nThe stress $\\sigma(t)$ is uniform throughout the series element:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_s(t) = \\sigma_d(t)\n$$\nThe constitutive relations for the individual elements are given as:\nFor the spring (Hooke's Law): $\\sigma_s(t) = E \\epsilon_s(t)$, which can be rewritten as $\\epsilon_s(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{E}$.\nFor the dashpot (Newtonian fluid): $\\sigma_d(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt}$, which can be rewritten as $\\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}$.\n\nTo establish the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the Maxwell model, we differentiate the total strain equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_s(t)}{dt} + \\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt}\n$$\nNow, substitute the constitutive relations into this expression. The time derivative of the spring strain is $\\frac{d\\epsilon_s(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{E}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt}$. The rate of strain for the dashpot is given directly. Substitution yields the general constitutive ODE for the Maxwell model:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{E}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis equation relates the total strain rate to the stress and the rate of change of stress.\n\nThe problem specifies a stress relaxation experiment, where a constant strain $\\epsilon_0$ is applied at $t=0$ and held constant thereafter. This is described by the strain history $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$. For all times $t  0$, the strain is constant, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0$. Consequently, its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{d\\epsilon(t)}{dt} = 0$ for $t  0$.\nSubstituting this into the general ODE gives the specific ODE governing the stress $\\sigma(t)$ during relaxation for $t  0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E}\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}\n$$\nRearranging gives a first-order, linear, homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\sigma(t)\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, a physically correct initial condition at $t=0^{+}$ is required. At the moment the strain $\\epsilon_0$ is applied, $t=0$, the response is instantaneous. The dashpot, which represents viscous flow, requires a finite time to deform. Therefore, at the instant of loading, its strain is zero: $\\epsilon_d(0^{+}) = 0$. The entire instantaneous strain must be accommodated by the elastic spring. Thus, at $t=0^{+}$, the spring strain is equal to the total applied strain: $\\epsilon_s(0^{+}) = \\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_0$.\nThe initial stress in the system, $\\sigma(0^{+})$, is therefore determined exclusively by the spring's response:\n$$\n\\sigma(0^{+}) = E \\epsilon_s(0^{+}) = E \\epsilon_0\n$$\nThis is the required initial condition for the ODE.\n\nWe now solve the ODE $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dt} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\sigma$ with the initial condition $\\sigma(0) = E \\epsilon_0$. This is a separable equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{\\sigma} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(t=0, \\sigma=\\sigma(0^{+}))$ to a general state $(t, \\sigma=\\sigma(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\sigma(0^{+})}^{\\sigma(t)} \\frac{1}{\\sigma'} d\\sigma' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{E}{\\eta} dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(\\sigma(t)) - \\ln(\\sigma(0^{+})) = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\sigma(0^{+})}\\right) = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the stress as a function of time:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma(0^{+}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the initial condition $\\sigma(0^{+}) = E \\epsilon_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the relaxation modulus, $G(t)$, via the relation $\\sigma(t) = G(t) \\epsilon_0$. By comparing this definition with our derived expression for $\\sigma(t)$, we can identify $G(t)$:\n$$\nG(t) \\epsilon_0 = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon_0  0$, we can divide by it to obtain the final closed-form expression for the relaxation modulus:\n$$\nG(t) = E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nThe expression for $G(t)$ contains a characteristic time, $\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E}$. This quantity has units of time (Viscosity/[Stress] $\\div$ [Stress] = [Time]) and is known as the relaxation time. Its physical interpretation arises from observing the stress decay. At time $t=\\tau$, the stress becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\tau) = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\frac{\\eta}{E}\\right) = E \\epsilon_0 \\exp(-1) = \\frac{\\sigma(0^{+})}{e}\n$$\nThus, the relaxation time $\\tau$ is the time required for the stress in the material to decay to $1/e$ (approximately $36.8\\%$) of its initial value following the application of a step strain. It is the characteristic timescale of the stress relaxation process for the Maxwell material. A long relaxation time (large $\\eta$ or small $E$) signifies a slow decay of internal stresses, characteristic of a more solid-like response, while a short relaxation time indicates a rapid dissipation of stress, characteristic of a more fluid-like response.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2536236"}, {"introduction": "While the single-element Maxwell model provides crucial insight, real polymeric materials exhibit a spectrum of relaxation processes.

I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\n(a) Derivation of Step Responses\n\nThe fundamental constitutive relation for a linear viscoelastic material, according to the Boltzmann superposition principle, relates the stress $\\sigma(t)$ to the history of strain $\\varepsilon(t)$. Assuming zero stress and strain for $t0$, the integral form is:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} G(t-t') \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t')}{dt'} dt'\n$$\nHere, $G(t)$ is the stress relaxation modulus, representing the stress response to a unit step strain applied at $t=0$.\n\nLet us first consider a step strain input $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, where $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is a constant magnitude and $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. The time derivative of the strain is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} = \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. Substituting this into the superposition integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} G(t-t') \\left( \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t') \\right) dt'\n$$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states that $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\delta(x-c) dx = f(c)$ for $acb$, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(t-0) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(t)\n$$\nThis derivation confirms that for a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, the resulting stress for $t0$ is $\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(t)$. This is, in fact, the definition of the relaxation modulus $G(t)$.\n\nAnalogously, the strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ can be expressed as a functional of the stress history $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} J(t-t') \\frac{d\\sigma(t')}{dt'} dt'\n$$\nHere, $J(t)$ is the creep compliance, representing the strain response to a unit step stress applied at $t=0$.\n\nNow, consider a step stress input $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$. The time derivative is $\\frac{d\\sigma(t)}{dt} = \\sigma_{0} \\delta(t)$. Substituting this into the second superposition integral:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} J(t-t') \\left( \\sigma_{0} \\delta(t') \\right) dt'\n$$\nAgain, applying the sifting property of the delta function:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\sigma_{0} J(t-0) = \\sigma_{0} J(t)\n$$\nThis confirms that for a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, the resulting strain for $t0$ is $\\varepsilon(t) = \\sigma_{0} J(t)$, which is the definition of the creep compliance $J(t)$.\n\n(b) Limiting Values and Their Relationship\n\nFor a viscoelastic solid, we define and interpret the limiting values as follows:\n- $G(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} G(t)$: This is the instantaneous modulus. It represents the material's immediate, purely elastic response to a suddenly applied strain, before any viscous flow or molecular rearrangement can occur. Physically, it corresponds to the \"glassy\" modulus of the polymer, where chains are effectively frozen on this timescale.\n- $G(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} G(t)$: This is the equilibrium or long-time modulus. It is the finite stress that remains in a viscoelastic solid after all relaxation processes have completed under a constant applied strain. This non-zero modulus arises from the permanent cross-linked or entangled network structure that can support stress indefinitely. For a viscoelastic fluid, $G(\\infty)=0$.\n- $J(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} J(t)$: This is the instantaneous compliance. It is the material's immediate elastic strain response to a suddenly applied stress. It is the reciprocal of the instantaneous modulus.\n- $J(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} J(t)$: This is the equilibrium or long-time compliance. It is the final, finite strain reached in a viscoelastic solid under a constant stress after all creep processes have ceased. It is the reciprocal of the equilibrium modulus. For a viscoelastic fluid that flows indefinitely, $J(\\infty)$ would be infinite.\n\nTo establish the relationship between these quantities, we consider the material's behavior in the short-time and long-time limits.\nAt the moment of load application, $t=0^{+}$, the viscous components of the material have not had time to respond. The material behaves as a perfectly elastic solid with an instantaneous elastic modulus $E_{inst}$.\nFor a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, the stress at $t=0^{+}$ is $\\sigma(0^{+}) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(0^{+})$.\nFrom the elastic definition, $\\sigma(0^{+}) = E_{inst} \\varepsilon(0^{+}) = E_{inst} \\varepsilon_{0}$.\nComparing these gives $G(0^{+}) = E_{inst}$.\nFor a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, the strain at $t=0^{+}$ is $\\varepsilon(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{0} J(0^{+})$.\nFrom the elastic definition, $\\varepsilon(0^{+}) = \\sigma(0^{+}) / E_{inst} = \\sigma_{0} / E_{inst}$.\nComparing these gives $J(0^{+}) = 1 / E_{inst}$.\nTherefore, we establish the relationship for the instantaneous response:\n$$\nJ(0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{G(0^{+})}\n$$\nAs time approaches infinity, $t \\to \\infty$, the material reaches a state of mechanical equilibrium. It again behaves as a perfectly elastic solid, but now with an equilibrium elastic modulus $E_{eq}$.\nFor a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, the stress relaxes to an equilibrium value $\\sigma(\\infty) = \\varepsilon_{0} G(\\infty)$.\nFrom the elastic definition at equilibrium, $\\sigma(\\infty) = E_{eq} \\varepsilon(\\infty) = E_{eq} \\varepsilon_{0}$.\nComparing these gives $G(\\infty) = E_{eq}$.\nFor a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, the strain creeps to an equilibrium value $\\varepsilon(\\infty) = \\sigma_{0} J(\\infty)$.\nFrom the elastic definition at equilibrium, $\\varepsilon(\\infty) = \\sigma(\\infty) / E_{eq} = \\sigma_{0} / E_{eq}$.\nComparing these gives $J(\\infty) = 1 / E_{eq}$.\nTherefore, for a viscoelastic solid with a finite non-zero equilibrium modulus, we establish the relationship for the long-time response:\n$$\nJ(\\infty) = \\frac{1}{G(\\infty)}\n$$\n\n(c) Calculation of the Dimensionless Scalar $R$\n\nThe given stress relaxation modulus is of the generalized Maxwell form:\n$$\nG(t)=G_{e}+g_{1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)+g_{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe parameters are given as $G_{e}=50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $g_{1}=100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $g_{2}=150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_{1}=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\tau_{2}=10\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the instantaneous modulus $G(0^{+})$ by taking the limit as $t \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$\nG(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\left[ G_{e}+g_{1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)+g_{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\exp(0)=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nG(0^{+}) = G_{e} + g_{1} + g_{2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the equilibrium modulus $G(\\infty)$ by taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nG(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ G_{e}+g_{1}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right)+g_{2}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-kt) = 0$ for $k0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nG(\\infty) = G_{e} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nUsing the relationships derived in part (b), we find the corresponding compliances:\n$$\nJ(0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{G(0^{+})} = \\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\infty) = \\frac{1}{G(\\infty)} = \\frac{1}{50}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can compute the dimensionless scalar $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{G(0^{+})}{G(\\infty)} + \\frac{J(\\infty)}{J(0^{+})}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have calculated:\n$$\nR = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{50}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}}{\\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe units cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless quantity.

The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, resting on the fundamental principles of linear viscoelasticity theory. All necessary parameters for the generalized Maxwell model of the shear relaxation modulus and the strain history are provided. The strain magnitudes are small, consistent with the assumption of linearity. Although the problem uses the symbols $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\varepsilon(t)$ which typically denote normal stress and strain, it explicitly provides the material's *shear* relaxation modulus, $G(t)$. Therefore, it is logical and necessary to interpret $\\sigma(t)$ as shear stress, which is often denoted by $\\tau(t)$, and $\\varepsilon(t)$ as shear strain, denoted by $\\gamma(t)$. We will proceed under this interpretation.\n\nThe starting point is the Boltzmann superposition integral, which relates the stress history $\\sigma(t)$ to the strain history $\\varepsilon(t)$ for a linear viscoelastic material:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t')}{dt'} dt'\n$$\nHere, $G(t)$ is the stress relaxation modulus and the integral represents a convolution.\n\nThe prescribed strain history is given by a sum of two Heaviside step functions:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{1} H(t) + \\varepsilon_{2} H(t-t_{1})\n$$\nTo use the Boltzmann superposition integral, we must first find the time derivative of the strain history, $\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt}$. The derivative of the Heaviside step function $H(t-a)$ is the Dirac delta function $\\delta(t-a)$. Thus, the strain rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\varepsilon_{1} H(t) + \\varepsilon_{2} H(t-t_{1}) \\right] = \\varepsilon_{1} \\delta(t) + \\varepsilon_{2} \\delta(t-t_{1})\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for the strain rate into the Boltzmann integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\left[ \\varepsilon_{1} \\delta(t') + \\varepsilon_{2} \\delta(t'-t_{1}) \\right] dt'\n$$\nDue to the linearity of the integration operator, we can separate this into two parts:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{1} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\delta(t') dt' + \\varepsilon_{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\delta(t'-t_{1}) dt'\n$$\nWe evaluate these integrals using the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states that $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\delta(x-c)dx = f(c)$ for $a  c  b$.\nThe first integral involves $\\delta(t')$, so we set $t'=0$ in the function $G(t-t')$, which gives $G(t)$. This response exists only for $t \\ge 0$.\nThe second integral involves $\\delta(t'-t_1)$, so we set $t'=t_1$ in $G(t-t')$, which gives $G(t-t_1)$. This response exists only for $t \\ge t_1$.\nUsing the Heaviside function to represent the domains over which these responses are active, we obtain the derived expression for the stress response $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_{1} G(t) H(t) + \\varepsilon_{2} G(t-t_{1}) H(t-t_{1})\n$$\nThis expression is valid for all time $t$.

For $t \\ge t_1$, $\\sigma(t) = \\varepsilon_1 G(t) + \\varepsilon_2 G(t-t_1)$.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is a direct consequence of the superposition principle.\nThe first term, $\\varepsilon_{1} G(t) H(t)$, represents the stress response to the first strain step of magnitude $\\varepsilon_{1}$ applied at $t=0$. At the moment of application, the instantaneous stress is $\\varepsilon_{1} G(0)$. For $t0$, this stress component relaxes over time, following the decay profile of the material's relaxation modulus $G(t)$.\nThe second term, $\\varepsilon_{2} G(t-t_{1}) H(t-t_{1})$, is the stress response to the second strain step of magnitude $\\varepsilon_{2}$ applied at a later time $t=t_1$. The term $G(t-t_1)$ demonstrates the time-translation invariance of the material response: the relaxation process initiated by this second step is identical in form to the first, but is shifted in time by $t_1$.\nThe total stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the algebraic sum of the stresses generated by each individual strain step, embodying the essence of linear superposition. In this specific problem, $\\varepsilon_2$ is negative, which means the second step is a strain reduction, and thus it induces a stress component that is opposite in sign to the stress from the first step, leading to an overall faster stress decay for $tt_1$ than would occur from the first step alone.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate the stress at $t=60.0\\,\\text{s}$. The given parameters are:\n$\\varepsilon_{1} = 0.020$\n$\\varepsilon_{2} = -0.012$\n$t_{1} = 25.0\\,\\text{s}$\nSince we are evaluating at $t=60.0\\,\\text{s}$, and $60.0  25.0$, both Heaviside functions in our derived expression are equal to $1$. The stress is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma(60.0) = \\varepsilon_{1} G(60.0) + \\varepsilon_{2} G(60.0 - 25.0) = (0.020) G(60.0) + (-0.012) G(35.0)\n$$\nThe shear relaxation modulus is given by:\n$$\nG(t) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} G_{i}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nwith parameters $G_{\\infty}=2.0\\,\\text{MPa}$, $G_1=8.0\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\tau_1=0.50\\,\\text{s}$, $G_2=5.0\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\tau_2=10.0\\,\\text{s}$, $G_3=15.0\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\tau_3=100.0\\,\\text{s}$. All moduli are in units of $\\text{MPa}$ and times are in $\\text{s}$. The resulting stress will be in $\\text{MPa}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $G(60.0)$:\n$$\nG(60.0) = 2.0 + 8.0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{60.0}{0.50}\\right) + 5.0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{60.0}{10.0}\\right) + 15.0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{60.0}{100.0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nG(60.0) = 2.0 + 8.0\\exp(-120) + 5.0\\exp(-6) + 15.0\\exp(-0.6)\n$$\nThe term $\\exp(-120)$ is negligible.\n$G(60.0) \\approx 2.0 + 5.0(0.00247875) + 15.0(0.54881164) \\approx 2.0 + 0.01239375 + 8.2321746 \\approx 10.244568\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nNext, we calculate $G(35.0)$:\n$$\nG(35.0) = 2.0 + 8.0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{35.0}{0.50}\\right) + 5.0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{35.0}{10.0}\\right) + 15.0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{35.0}{100.0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nG(35.0) = 2.0 + 8.0\\exp(-70) + 5.0\\exp(-3.5) + 15.0\\exp(-0.35)\n$$\nThe term $\\exp(-70)$ is negligible.\n$G(35.0) \\approx 2.0 + 5.0(0.03019738) + 15.0(0.70468809) \\approx 2.0 + 0.1509869 + 10.5703214 \\approx 12.721308\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nFinally, we compute $\\sigma(60.0)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(60.0) \\approx (0.020)(10.244568) - (0.012)(12.721308)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(60.0) \\approx 0.20489136 - 0.15265570 \\approx 0.05223566\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.05224\\,\\text{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05224}\n$$", "id": "2536231"}]}
