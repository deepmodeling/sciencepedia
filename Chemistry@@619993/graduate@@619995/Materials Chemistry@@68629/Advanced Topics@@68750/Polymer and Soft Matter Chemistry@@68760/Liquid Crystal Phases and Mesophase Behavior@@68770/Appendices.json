It is a standard, self-contained, and scientifically grounded problem from the field of soft matter physics. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe state of the nematic liquid crystal is described by the director field $\\mathbf{n}(z)$. Given the planar anchoring along the $x$-axis and the electric field along the $z$-axis, any distortion will occur in the $x$-$z$ plane. We define $\\theta(z)$ as the angle between the director $\\mathbf{n}$ and the $x$-axis. The director field can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}(z) = (\\cos\\theta(z), 0, \\sin\\theta(z))\n$$\nThe boundary conditions of strong planar anchoring at $z=0$ and $z=d$ impose that the director is aligned with the $x$-axis at the substrates. This translates to the condition:\n$$\n\\theta(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\theta(d) = 0\n$$\nThe total free energy per unit area, $F$, of the system is the integral of the free energy density, $f$, over the thickness of the cell:\n$$\nF[\\theta] = \\int_{0}^{d} f(\\theta, \\frac{d\\theta}{dz})\\,dz\n$$\nThe free energy density $f$ consists of two contributions: the elastic energy density, $f_{el}$, and the dielectric energy density, $f_{diel}$.\n\nWithin the single elastic constant approximation ($K_{11}=K_{22}=K_{33}=K$), the Oseen-Frank elastic energy density simplifies to:\n$$\nf_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}K (\\nabla\\mathbf{n})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}K \\left[ \\left(\\frac{d n_x}{dz}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d n_y}{dz}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d n_z}{dz}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the components of $\\mathbf{n}(z)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_x}{dz} = -\\sin\\theta(z) \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}, \\quad \\frac{dn_y}{dz} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dn_z}{dz} = \\cos\\theta(z) \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\n$$\nThus, the elastic energy density is:\n$$\nf_{el} = \\frac{1}{2}K \\left[ (-\\sin\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dz})^2 + (\\cos\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dz})^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}K (\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}K \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe dielectric energy density is given as $f_{diel} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E})^{2}$. The electric field is $\\mathbf{E} = (0, 0, E)$. The scalar product is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = E \\sin\\theta(z)\n$$\nTherefore, the dielectric energy density is:\n$$\nf_{diel} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\sin^2\\theta(z)\n$$\nThe positive dielectric anisotropy, $\\Delta\\epsilon  0$, ensures that this term favors alignment of the director with the electric field (i.e., favors non-zero $\\theta$).\n\nThe total free energy functional to be minimized is:\n$$\nF[\\theta] = \\int_{0}^{d} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}K \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\sin^2\\theta(z) \\right] dz\n$$\nThe equilibrium configuration $\\theta(z)$ must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation for the integrand $L(\\theta, \\theta') = \\frac{1}{2}K(\\theta')^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\sin^2\\theta$, where $\\theta' = d\\theta/dz$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta'}\\right) = 0\n$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 (2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta) = -\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta'} = K\\theta'\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives:\n$$\n-\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - K\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nK\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} + \\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = 0\n$$\nThe uniformly planar state, $\\theta(z) = 0$, is always a solution to this equation, as $\\sin(0) = 0$. We are interested in the critical field $E_c$ at which a non-trivial solution (a distorted state) first becomes possible. This threshold can be found by analyzing the stability of the $\\theta=0$ state. For small deformations near the threshold, we assume $\\theta(z)$ is small, which allows for the small-angle approximation: $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ and $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1$.\nThe linearized Euler-Lagrange equation becomes:\n$$\nK\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} + \\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2 \\theta = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can write it as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} + q^2\\theta = 0, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad q^2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E^2}{K}\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n$$\n\\theta(z) = A\\sin(qz) + B\\cos(qz)\n$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions $\\theta(0)=0$ and $\\theta(d)=0$.\nFrom $\\theta(0)=0$:\n$$\nA\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = 0 \\implies B=0\n$$\nThe solution simplifies to $\\theta(z) = A\\sin(qz)$.\nFrom $\\theta(d)=0$:\n$$\nA\\sin(qd) = 0\n$$\nA non-trivial solution requires the amplitude $A \\neq 0$. Therefore, the condition for a distorted state to exist is:\n$$\n\\sin(qd) = 0\n$$\nThis implies $qd = m\\pi$, where $m$ is an integer. The case $m=0$ corresponds to $q=0$, which yields the trivial solution $\\theta(z)=0$. The first non-trivial solution corresponds to the lowest positive integer value for $m$, which is $m=1$. Higher values of $m$ correspond to higher-energy deformation modes that are triggered at higher fields.\n\nThe critical condition for the onset of instability is thus given by $m=1$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{\\pi}{d}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $q$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E_c^2}{K}} = \\frac{\\pi}{d}\n$$\nSquaring both sides and solving for the critical field $E_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon E_c^2}{K} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{d}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nE_c^2 = \\frac{K}{\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{d}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nE_c = \\frac{\\pi}{d}\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon}}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the minimum field magnitude required to destabilize the uniformly planar state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{d}\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\epsilon_{0}\\Delta\\epsilon}}}\n$$", "id": "2496448"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the theoretical foundation of the Frederiks transition, this practice bridges the gap between theory and experiment.

In the Landau–de Gennes (LdG) framework near a defect core where the scalar order parameter amplitude varies, the relevant competition is between the quadratic bulk term with coefficient $A$ and the elastic gradient term with coefficient $L_1$. A minimal one-dimensional estimate treats the scalar order parameter $Q$ varying over a length $\\xi$, giving a bulk density scale $f_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\\sim \\tfrac{A}{2}Q^{2}$ and a gradient density scale $f_{\\mathrm{grad}}\\sim \\tfrac{L_1}{2}\\,(\\nabla Q)^{2}\\sim \\tfrac{L_1}{2}\\,(Q/\\xi)^{2}$. Balancing these to define the core size (coherence length) gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{L_1}{2}\\frac{Q^{2}}{\\xi^{2}} \\sim \\frac{A}{2}Q^{2}\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\xi \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{L_1}{A}}.\n$$\n\nUsing this in the expression for $R_c$ yields\n\n$$\nR_c=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{L_1}{A}}.\n$$\n\nThis expression is independent of the OF constant $K$ to leading order because $K$ cancels in the balance of the two elastic energies; the bulk coefficient $A$ from the LdG free energy enters only through the core cutoff $\\xi$.\n\nTherefore, the requested estimate for the critical radius, expressed in meters and in terms of $L_1$ and $A$, is\n\n$$\nR_c=\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{L_1}{A}}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{8}{\\pi}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{L_1}{A}}}$$", "id": "2496451"}]}
