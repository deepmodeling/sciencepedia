The provided values for $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ are physically realistic for a dimerization process driven by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding.

The units for $\\Delta H^\\circ$ ($\\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ ($\\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$) are different but consistent; they require a standard unit conversion, which is an element of competence in solving such a problem. There are no contradictions.\n- **Feasibility:** The conditions and values are physically and scientifically plausible. The assumption of temperature-independent enthalpy and entropy is a common and acceptable approximation over a limited temperature range for such problems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds from fundamental thermodynamic relations. The standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, is related to the standard equilibrium constant, $K^\\circ$, by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K^\\circ\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change is also defined in terms of the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^\\circ$, and the standard entropy change, $\\Delta S^\\circ$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T \\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\n\nThe problem requires finding the temperature $T$ at which $K^\\circ = 1$. At this specific condition, the natural logarithm term becomes $\\ln(1) = 0$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln(1) = -RT(0) = 0\n$$\nThis signifies that the system is at standard equilibrium. By equating the two expressions for $\\Delta G^\\circ$ under this condition, we obtain:\n$$\n0 = \\Delta H^\\circ - T \\Delta S^\\circ\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the temperature $T$:\n$$\nT \\Delta S^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{\\Delta S^\\circ}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. It is critical to ensure unit consistency. We convert $\\Delta H^\\circ$ from $\\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$:\n$\\Delta H^\\circ = -80\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = -80 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = -80000\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\nThe standard entropy change is given as $\\Delta S^\\circ = -200\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{-80000\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{-200\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = 400\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe calculated temperature is exactly $400\\ \\mathrm{K}$. As per the problem's requirement to round to three significant figures, this is expressed as $4.00 \\times 10^2\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\n### Qualitative Explanation\nThe signs and magnitudes of $\\Delta H^\\circ$ and $\\Delta S^\\circ$ exemplify the principle of enthalpy–entropy compensation in supramolecular self-assembly.\n\n$1$. **Enthalpic Contribution ($\\Delta H^\\circ$):** The standard enthalpy change is $\\Delta H^\\circ = -80\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, which is negative. This indicates that the dimerization process is **exothermic** and thus **enthalpically favorable**. The formation of stabilizing intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds between the two monomer units $M$ to form the dimer $D$, releases energy. This enthalpic term promotes self-assembly.\n\n$2$. **Entropic Contribution ($\\Delta S^\\circ$):** The standard entropy change is $\\Delta S^\\circ = -200\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, which is negative. This indicates that the dimerization process leads to an increase in order and is thus **entropically unfavorable**. When two independent monomer molecules associate to form a single dimer, there is a net loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom. This entropic penalty opposes self-assembly.\n\n$3$. **Enthalpy–Entropy Compensation and Temperature Dependence:** The spontaneity of the dimerization is determined by the sign of $\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ$. The two terms, $\\Delta H^\\circ$ (negative) and $-T\\Delta S^\\circ$ (positive), are in opposition. The balance between them is temperature-dependent.\n-   At temperatures **below** the calculated equilibrium temperature of $T = 400\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the magnitude of the favorable enthalpic term, $|\\Delta H^\\circ|$, is greater than the magnitude of the unfavorable entropic term, $|T\\Delta S^\\circ|$. This results in $\\Delta G^\\circ  0$ and $K^\\circ > 1$. The equilibrium lies to the right, favoring the formation of the dimer $D$. Self-assembly into dimers is spontaneous.\n-   At temperatures **above** $T = 400\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the temperature-dependent entropic term $|T\\Delta S^\\circ|$ dominates the constant enthalpic term $|\\Delta H^\\circ|$. This results in $\\Delta G^\\circ > 0$ and $K^\\circ  1$. The equilibrium shifts to the left, favoring the dissociated monomers $M$. The assembled dimers will spontaneously disassemble.\n-   At exactly $T = 400\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the favorable enthalpic contribution is perfectly **compensated** by the unfavorable entropic contribution, resulting in $\\Delta G^\\circ = 0$ and $K^\\circ = 1$. At this point, the monomer and dimer populations are in a specific balance dictated by the stoichiometry and standard state definitions.\n\nThis temperature-dependent equilibrium is critical for the controlled formation of Langmuir–Blodgett films. By adjusting the temperature of the aqueous subphase around this crossover point of $400\\ \\mathrm{K}$, one can precisely tune the degree of pre-organization and association of the amphiphilic monomers at the air-water interface. This control is essential for creating a monolayer with the desired density, order, and mechanical properties required for a successful and high-quality transfer to a solid substrate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "2521513"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the thermodynamic driving forces for assembly, the next crucial question is what geometric form the resulting aggregates will take. This practice [@problem_id:2521489] introduces the critical packing parameter, a powerful and intuitive concept that connects an amphiphile's molecular geometry—its tail volume $v$, headgroup area $a_0$, and chain length $l_c$—to the preferred curvature of the final supramolecular structure.

A geometric description captures these competing tendencies by relating, for a given aggregate curvature, the interfacial area per molecule to the volume occupied by each tail and the tail extension.\n\nFor an aggregate characterized by a mean interfacial radius of curvature $R$ and interfacial area per molecule $a$, space-filling of the hydrophobic region imposes a relationship between $a$, the hydrocarbon tail volume $v$, and the radial extent of the hydrophobic domain along the chain direction, which is bounded above by the maximum effective chain length $l_{c}$. Representative geometries give:\n- For a spherical micelle, the total area $4\\pi R^{2}$ equals $Na$ and the total core volume $(4/3)\\pi R^{3}$ equals $Nv$, where $N$ is the aggregation number. Eliminating $N$ yields $a = 3v/R$.

Chain stretching: The effective hydrocarbon extension in the aggregate is taken to be close to the all-trans maximum, $l_{c}$, which is reasonable for low-curvature aggregates (bilayers) where chains are relatively extended; deviations due to gauche defects would reduce the effective $l$ and increase $P$, further stabilizing lamellar morphologies.\n  2.

Monodispersity and single-tail geometry: A single, flexible hydrocarbon tail is assumed with uniform $v$; polydispersity and specific headgroup–counterion interactions are neglected.\nThese assumptions are standard for interpreting packing-controlled morphology and are consistent with using Langmuir monolayer data to estimate $a_{0}$ for self-assembly predictions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.521}$$", "id": "2521489"}, {"introduction": "Moving from discrete aggregates to collective assemblies, this exercise [@problem_id:2521518] challenges you to model the behavior of a Langmuir monolayer, a two-dimensional system of crucial importance in materials science.

All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions of the model are clearly defined. I will therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the surface pressure $\\Pi$ of a two-dimensional ideal gas. We begin with the principles of classical statistical mechanics. For a system of $N$ non-interacting, indistinguishable particles confined to a two-dimensional area $A$ at temperature $T$, the canonical partition function $Z_N$ is the fundamental quantity.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a single particle of mass $m$ is purely kinetic, as the particles are non-interacting:\n$$ H_1 = \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2}{2m} $$\nwhere $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the components of momentum in the two-dimensional plane.\n\nThe single-particle partition function, $z_1$, is given by the integral over the phase space of one particle:\n$$ z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^2} \\int \\int_A dx dy \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp_y \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_1}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe factor $h^2$ is the volume of a single phase-space cell in two dimensions, where $h$ is Planck's constant. The integral over the spatial coordinates $dx dy$ simply yields the total area $A$.\n$$ z_1 = \\frac{A}{h^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{p_x^2}{2mk_B T}\\right) dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{p_y^2}{2mk_B T}\\right) dp_y $$\nBoth momentum integrals are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$.

The calculated pressure, $\\Pi \\approx 0.0411\\ \\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$, is extremely low compared to the typical experimental values for condensed Langmuir monolayers, which are cited to be in the range of $10$–$50\\ \\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$. The discrepancy is approximately three orders of magnitude.\n\nThis significant difference arises from a fundamental limitation of the model used. The most critical assumption responsible for this discrepancy is that the amphiphilic molecules are **non-interacting**. The ideal gas model treats molecules as point particles that do not exert forces on one another. This approximation is only valid at very low surface concentrations (large area per molecule), corresponding to the gaseous phase of a monolayer.\nThe experimental values of $10$–$50\\ \\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$ are characteristic of *condensed* phases (liquid-expanded or liquid-condensed), where molecules are closely packed. In such dense states, intermolecular forces—van der Waals attractions between hydrophobic tails and strong short-range steric repulsions—are dominant. These interactions are completely neglected in the ideal gas law $\\Pi A = N k_B T$. A correct theoretical description of condensed monolayers requires a more sophisticated equation of state, such as a two-dimensional analog of the van der Waals equation, which incorporates parameters for finite molecular size and intermolecular attraction. Therefore, the discrepancy does not indicate a failure in our calculation, but rather the predictable inapplicability of the ideal gas model to a dense, interacting system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0411}$$", "id": "2521518"}]}
