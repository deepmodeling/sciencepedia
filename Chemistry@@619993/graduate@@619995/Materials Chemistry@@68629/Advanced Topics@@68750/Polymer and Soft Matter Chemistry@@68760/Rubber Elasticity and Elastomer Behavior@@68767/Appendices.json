The fundamental assumption of ideal rubber elasticity is that the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, upon isothermal deformation is zero. Therefore, the free energy change is purely entropic, governed by the change in conformational entropy, $\\Delta S$:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\Delta U - T \\Delta S = -T \\Delta S $$\nwhere $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor an affine deformation of a network containing $N$ active polymer chains in an initial volume $V_0$, the statistical mechanics of Gaussian chains gives the change in entropy as:\n$$ \\Delta S = -\\frac{1}{2} N k_B (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2 - 3) $$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\lambda_x, \\lambda_y, \\lambda_z$ are the principal stretch ratios along the Cartesian axes.\n\nThe change in Helmholtz free energy per unit initial volume, which is the strain energy density function $W$, is consequently:\n$$ W = \\frac{\\Delta A}{V_0} = \\frac{1}{V_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} N k_B T (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2 - 3) \\right) $$\nBy defining the number density of active chains as $n = N/V_0$, we obtain the strain energy function for what is known as a neo-Hookean material:\n$$ W = \\frac{1}{2} n k_B T (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2 - 3) $$\nThe problem states the material is incompressible, which imposes the kinematic constraint $\\lambda_x \\lambda_y \\lambda_z = 1$.

The network is composed of ideal Gaussian chains, which implies the chains are long, flexible, and far from their maximum extension.\n2.  The deformation is affine, meaning microscopic chain-end displacements follow the macroscopic deformation field.\n3.  The elastic response is purely entropic; there is no change in internal energy upon isothermal deformation ($\\Delta U = 0$).\n4.  The elastomer is incompressible (constant volume).\n5.  Inter-chain interactions and physical entanglements do not contribute to the stored elastic energy.\n\nFrom the derived relation $G = n k_B T$, the effect of temperature is clear. For a fixed network structure (constant $n$), the shear modulus $G$ increases linearly with increasing absolute temperature $T$.

It represents a standard, formalizable problem in the specified field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe elastic properties of an ideal elastomer network originate from the change in conformational entropy of the polymer chains upon deformation. The change in Helmholtz free energy density, $W = \\Delta A_{el}$, of a network of Gaussian chains subjected to principal stretches $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ is given by:\n$$\nW = C (\\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_3^2 - 3)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant related to the network structure and temperature. The material is stated to be incompressible, which imposes the constraint $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$. The shear modulus, $G$, can be defined from the stress-strain relationship in simple shear. For an energy density function of the form above (a neo-Hookean form), the shear modulus is $G = 2C$. Our task is to determine the appropriate form of $C$ for the affine and phantom models.\n\n**Affine Network Model**\nIn the affine network model, the crosslink junctions are assumed to be fixed within the elastic matrix and transform affinely with the macroscopic deformation. The elastic free energy density is calculated by summing the contributions from all $\\nu$ elastically active strands per unit volume. For this model, the constant $C$ is:\n$$\nC_{affine} = \\frac{1}{2} \\nu R T\n$$\nHere, $\\nu$ is the molar density of elastically active strands, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe shear modulus for the affine model, $G_{affine}$, is therefore:\n$$\nG_{affine} = 2 C_{affine} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\nu R T \\right) = \\nu R T\n$$\n\n**Phantom Network Model**\nIn the phantom network model, the crosslink junctions are not fixed but are free to fluctuate thermally around their mean positions. These fluctuations are constrained only by the $f$ chains attached to each junction. This model, developed by James and Guth, recognizes that only deformations of the mean positions of the junctions contribute to the elastic restoring force. The thermal fluctuations reduce the effective elastic response of the network. The result is a reduction in the elastic free energy density by a factor related to the junction functionality, $f$.\n\nThe effective number of elastic constraints is described by the cycle rank of the network, $\\xi$. For a network with $N_{chains}$ chains and $N_c$ crosslinks of functionality $f$, the cycle rank is $\\xi \\approx N_{chains} - N_c$. From topological considerations, $2 N_{chains} = f N_c$. This allows us to express $\\xi$ in terms of $N_{chains}$:\n$$\n\\xi = N_{chains} - \\frac{2}{f} N_{chains} = N_{chains} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{f} \\right)\n$$\nThe elastic free energy density is proportional to this effective number of chains (the cycle rank density, $\\xi/V$). Thus, the constant $C$ for the phantom model is:\n$$\nC_{phantom} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{f} \\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\nu R T\n$$\nThe shear modulus for the phantom model, $G_{phantom}$, is:\n$$\nG_{phantom} = 2 C_{phantom} = 2 \\left[ \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{f} \\right) \\frac{1}{2} \\nu R T \\right] = \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{f} \\right) \\nu R T\n$$\nFor the given tetrafunctional network, $f=4$.

It is often insufficient to capture the full complexity of an elastomer's response across all possible deformation states. Real material behavior is governed by the intricate evolution of the polymer network, which is more complex than this two-parameter model can represent, especially at larger strains.\n\nSecond, different deformation modes exhibit different sensitivities to the model parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$. The derived stress for equibiaxial tension, $\\sigma_1 = 2C_1(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4}) + 2C_2(\\lambda^4 - \\lambda^{-2})$, shows a strong dependence on $C_2$ through the $\\lambda^4$ term, which grows rapidly with stretch. In contrast, for uniaxial tension ($\\lambda_1 = \\lambda, \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\lambda^{-1/2}$), the true stress is $\\sigma_1 = 2C_1(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-1}) + 2C_2(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-2})$. Here, the dependence on $C_2$ is much weaker. A regression analysis performed solely on uniaxial data may yield parameters that accurately fit that specific stress-strain curve but do not correctly represent the material's response in biaxial states where the contribution of the $C_2$ term is significantly amplified. To obtain a more robust and predictive model, it is imperative to calibrate the material parameters using experimental data from multiple deformation modes, such as uniaxial tension, pure shear, and equibiaxial tension, in a simultaneous fitting procedure. This minimizes the error across a wider range of the deformation space and yields a more reliable parameter set.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.822}$$", "id": "2518781"}]}
