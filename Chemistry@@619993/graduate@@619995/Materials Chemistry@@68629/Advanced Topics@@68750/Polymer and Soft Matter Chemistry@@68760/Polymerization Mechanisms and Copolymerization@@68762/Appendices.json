The initial number of A–A monomer molecules is $\\frac{N_{A,0}}{2}$, and the initial number of B–B monomer molecules is $\\frac{N_{B,0}}{2}$.\n\nThe total number of monomer units, which is the initial number of monomer molecules, $N_0$, is therefore:\n$$ N_0 = \\frac{N_{A,0}}{2} + \\frac{N_{B,0}}{2} = \\frac{N_{A,0} + N_{B,0}}{2} $$\nThe extent of reaction $p$ is defined for the limiting functional group, which is type $B$ since the stoichiometric ratio $r \\equiv N_{B,0}/N_{A,0}$ is given as $0 < r \\leq 1$.

Gelation is the formation of a macroscopic, crosslinked, three-dimensional polymer network, which manifests as an abrupt transition from a viscous liquid to an elastic solid (the 'gel'). According to the Flory–Stockmayer theory of gelation, the formation of such a network is only possible if the system contains monomer units with a functionality greater than $2$.\nThe average functionality of the monomers in the initial mixture, $f_{avg}$, is defined as:\n$$ f_{avg} = \\frac{\\sum N_i f_i}{\\sum N_i} $$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of moles of monomer $i$ and $f_i$ is its functionality. In this problem, all monomers are strictly bifunctional, meaning the functionality of every monomer, both A–A and B–B, is exactly $2$. Therefore, the average functionality $f_{avg}$ is:\n$$ f_{avg} = \\frac{(N_{A-A,0} \\times 2) + (N_{B-B,0} \\times 2)}{N_{A-A,0} + N_{B-B,0}} = \\frac{2(N_{A-A,0} + N_{B-B,0})}{N_{A-A,0} + N_{B-B,0}} = 2 $$\nThe critical extent of reaction at the gel point, $p_c$, is given by the relation:\n$$ p_c = \\frac{1}{f_{avg} - 1} $$\nFor a system with $f_{avg} = 2$, this equation predicts:\n$$ p_c = \\frac{1}{2 - 1} = 1 $$\nA value of $p_c=1$ means that gelation can only occur at $100\\%$ conversion. This is a theoretical limit that, in practice, is unattainable and does not correspond to true network formation. Qualitatively, monomers with functionality $f=2$ can only act as chain extenders, forming bonds at two points. This leads exclusively to the formation of linear polymer chains (or macrocycles, if cyclization were permitted). To create a network, branching points are required, which can only be provided by monomers having a functionality of $3$ or more. Since the system is comprised exclusively of bifunctional monomers, no branching can occur, and thus no three-dimensional network can form.\nTherefore, gelation cannot occur in this system.
