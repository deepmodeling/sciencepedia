It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a complete solution. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires three parts: first, a derivation of the relationship for crystallite size from diffraction line broadening; second, a numerical calculation of the crystallite size; and third, a discussion of the limitations imposed by microstrain.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Scherrer Equation**\n\nThe broadening of diffraction peaks from a crystalline material can be related to the finite size of the coherent scattering domains, or crystallites. We begin with the fundamental condition for constructive interference, Bragg's Law for first-order reflection ($n=1$):\n$$\n\\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the X-ray wavelength, $d$ is the spacing between lattice planes, and $\\theta$ is the Bragg angle.\n\nConsider a crystallite of finite thickness $D$, which is composed of $N$ lattice planes such that $D = Nd$. At the exact Bragg angle $\\theta$, rays scattered from all planes interfere constructively. A small deviation from the Bragg angle will lead to incomplete interference. The angular width of the diffraction peak is a measure of the range of angles over which the interference remains significantly constructive.\n\nWe can estimate this width by considering the condition for the first minimum of the diffraction intensity, adjacent to the Bragg peak maximum. This occurs when the path difference between the wave scattered from the top plane and the wave scattered from the bottom plane of the crystallite is $(N+1)\\lambda$. The path difference for scattering at an angle $\\theta' = \\theta + \\Delta\\theta$ is $2D\\sin(\\theta')$. At the Bragg angle, the path difference is $2D\\sin(\\theta) = 2(Nd)\\sin(\\theta) = N(2d\\sin\\theta) = N\\lambda$.\n\nThus, the condition for the first minimum is:\n$$\n2D\\sin(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) = (N+1)\\lambda\n$$\nFor a small angular deviation $\\Delta\\theta$, we can use the first-order Taylor expansion for the sine function: $\\sin(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) \\approx \\sin\\theta + \\Delta\\theta\\cos\\theta$. Substituting this into the equation for the minimum gives:\n$$\n2D(\\sin\\theta + \\Delta\\theta\\cos\\theta) \\approx (N+1)\\lambda = N\\lambda + \\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting $2D\\sin\\theta = N\\lambda$, we obtain:\n$$\nN\\lambda + 2D(\\Delta\\theta)\\cos\\theta \\approx N\\lambda + \\lambda\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n2D(\\Delta\\theta)\\cos\\theta \\approx \\lambda\n$$\nThe value $\\Delta\\theta$ represents the angular half-width from the peak maximum to the first minimum. The full angular width of the peak base is therefore $2\\Delta\\theta \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{D\\cos\\theta}$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, which we will denote $\\beta_{\\theta}$, is proportional to this width. This leads to the relation:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\theta} \\propto \\frac{\\lambda}{D\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nThe constant of proportionality, known as the Scherrer constant or shape factor $K$, depends on the crystallite morphology and is typically close to unity. For spherical crystallites, $K$ is approximately $0.9$. This yields the Scherrer equation:\n$$\nD = \\frac{K\\lambda}{\\beta_{\\theta}\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nIn experimental practice, the peak width is measured on the $2\\theta$ axis of the diffractometer. A width measured in $2\\theta$, let us call it $\\beta$, is twice the width in $\\theta$: $\\beta = 2\\beta_{\\theta}$. Substituting $\\beta_{\\theta} = \\beta/2$ into the equation would give $D = \\frac{2K\\lambda}{\\beta\\cos\\theta}$. However, standard convention, which we must follow, incorporates this factor of $2$ into the definition of $K$, or more commonly, defines the equation such that $\\beta$ is the FWHM in radians of $2\\theta$. The conventional form of the Scherrer equation, which we will use, is therefore:\n$$\nD = \\frac{K\\lambda}{\\beta\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is understood to be the physical FWHM of the peak, corrected for instrumental broadening, expressed in **radians of $2\\theta$**. This is the required relation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Crystallite Size**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Peak position: $2\\theta = 20.0^{\\circ}$, which implies $\\theta = 10.0^{\\circ}$.\n- Measured FWHM: $\\beta_{\\text{meas}} = 0.250^{\\circ}$.\n- Instrumental FWHM: $\\beta_{\\text{inst}} = 0.100^{\\circ}$.\n- Shape factor: $K = 0.90$.\n- Wavelength: $\\lambda = 0.15406\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFirst, we must correct the measured peak width for instrumental broadening. The problem states to assume Gaussian peak profiles, so we subtract the contributions in quadrature. The physical broadening, $\\beta$, is found from:\n$$\n\\beta^{2} = \\beta_{\\text{meas}}^{2} - \\beta_{\\text{inst}}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values in degrees:\n$$\n\\beta^{2} = (0.250^{\\circ})^{2} - (0.100^{\\circ})^{2} = 0.0625 - 0.0100 = 0.0525\\ \\text{deg}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\sqrt{0.0525}\\ \\text{deg} \\approx 0.22913\\ \\text{deg}\n$$\nThis is the physical FWHM in degrees of $2\\theta$. The Scherrer equation requires this width to be in radians. We convert $\\beta$ to radians:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\text{rad}} = 0.22913^{\\circ} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180^{\\circ}} \\approx 0.0039998\\ \\text{rad}\n$$\nNow, we apply the Scherrer equation using this corrected width $\\beta$ and the given parameters:\n$$\nD = \\frac{K\\lambda}{\\beta \\cos\\theta}\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{(0.90)(0.15406\\ \\mathrm{nm})}{(0.0039998\\ \\text{rad}) \\cos(10.0^{\\circ})}\n$$\nWe calculate $\\cos(10.0^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.98481$.\n$$\nD = \\frac{0.138654\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{0.0039998 \\times 0.98481} \\approx \\frac{0.138654\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{0.0039389} \\approx 35.199\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as required, we get the crystallite size:\n$$\nD = 35.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Limitation Due to Microstrain**\n\nThe analysis above assumes that all physical line broadening originates from finite crystallite size. In reality, another significant source of broadening is microstrain, $\\varepsilon$, which refers to local variations in the lattice parameter $d$. This broadening contribution, $\\beta_{\\varepsilon}$, is given by the Stokes-Wilson equation:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\varepsilon} = 4\\varepsilon\\tan\\theta\n$$\nThe total observed physical broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{phys}}$, is a convolution of the size contribution, $\\beta_{D}$, and the strain contribution, $\\beta_{\\varepsilon}$. Assuming Gaussian profiles, they add in quadrature: $\\beta_{\\text{phys}}^{2} = \\beta_{D}^{2} + \\beta_{\\varepsilon}^{2}$.\n\nIf a nonzero microstrain is present but ignored, we incorrectly attribute the total physical broadening $\\beta_{\\text{phys}}$ solely to size effects. That is, we use $\\beta = \\beta_{\\text{phys}}$ in the Scherrer equation. Since $\\beta_{\\text{phys}} > \\beta_{D}$, the denominator in the Scherrer equation, $D = K\\lambda/(\\beta \\cos\\theta)$, becomes artificially large. This leads to a calculated crystallite size $D$ that is **smaller** than the true size. Therefore, neglecting microstrain results in a systematic **underestimation** of the crystallite size.\n\nThe magnitude of this bias depends on the Bragg angle $\\theta$. The size broadening $\\beta_{D} = K\\lambda/(D\\cos\\theta)$ has a weak angular dependence (proportional to $1/\\cos\\theta$). In contrast, strain broadening $\\beta_{\\varepsilon} = 4\\varepsilon\\tan\\theta$ has a strong angular dependence (proportional to $\\tan\\theta$). At low angles, $\\tan\\theta$ is small, so strain broadening is minimal, and the bias in the calculated $D$ is small. At high angles, $\\tan\\theta$ becomes large, making the strain contribution more significant, or even dominant. Consequently, a single-peak analysis at a high angle $\\theta$ will yield a much more severely underestimated crystallite size than an analysis at a low angle.\n\nTo separate size and strain contributions, a standard multi-peak strategy known as a **Williamson-Hall plot** is employed. This method leverages the different angular dependencies of size and strain broadening. For simplicity, we can model the total broadening as a linear sum (formally valid for Lorentzian profiles, but the principle holds):\n$$\n\\beta_{\\text{phys}} = \\beta_{D} + \\beta_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{K\\lambda}{D\\cos\\theta} + 4\\varepsilon\\tan\\theta\n$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $\\cos\\theta$ rearranges it into the form of a linear equation, $y = mx+c$:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\text{phys}}\\cos\\theta = 4\\varepsilon\\sin\\theta + \\frac{K\\lambda}{D}\n$$\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Measure the corrected physical broadenings, $\\beta_{\\text{phys}}$, for several diffraction peaks at different angles, $\\theta$.\n2.  Plot $\\beta_{\\text{phys}}\\cos\\theta$ on the y-axis against $\\sin\\theta$ on the x-axis.\n3.  Perform a linear regression on the data points.\n4.  The slope of the line is equal to $4\\varepsilon$, from which the average microstrain $\\varepsilon$ can be determined.\n5.  The y-intercept of the line is equal to $K\\lambda/D$, from which the true crystallite size $D$ can be calculated, now free from the influence of strain.\n\nThis graphical method allows for the robust and simultaneous determination of both crystallite size and microstrain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{35.2}$$", "id": "2513654"}, {"introduction": "The stability of polymer crystals is not absolute but is governed by a delicate balance between the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization and the energetic penalty of creating surfaces.
