A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, the crosslink density is estimated. Second, this result is used to predict the stored elastic energy.\n\n**Part 1: Estimation of Crosslink Density, $\\nu$**\n\nAccording to the statistical theory of rubber elasticity, the equilibrium shear modulus, $G$, of an ideal polymer network is directly proportional to the density of elastically effective network chains, $\\nu$ (in moles per unit volume), and the absolute temperature, $T$. The relationship is given by:\n$$G = \\nu R T$$\nHere, $R$ is the universal gas constant. The problem states that the storage modulus $G^{\\prime} = 1.80 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ can be used as an approximation for the equilibrium modulus, $G \\approx G^{\\prime}$. A Pascal is equivalent to a Joule per cubic meter ($\\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{N \\ m^{-2}} = \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}$), which is a unit of energy density.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the crosslink density $\\nu$:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{G}{RT}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}}{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}) \\times (343 \\ \\mathrm{K})}$$\nThis calculation yields an intermediate value for the crosslink density:\n$$\\nu \\approx 631.17 \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ m^{-3}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Prediction of Maximum Recoverable Work**\n\nThe work done per unit reference volume to deform an elastic material is stored as strain energy density, $W$. For an ideal, incompressible network (which is described by the neo-Hookean hyperelastic model), the strain energy density is a function of the principal stretches $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} G (I_1 - 3)$$\nwhere $I_1 = \\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_3^2$ is the first invariant of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.\n\nFor a uniaxial stretch by a ratio $\\lambda$, the principal stretches are $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$. Due to the incompressibility constraint, $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$, the transverse stretches are equal: $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\lambda^{-1/2}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $I_1$:\n$$I_1 = \\lambda^2 + (\\lambda^{-1/2})^2 + (\\lambda^{-1/2})^2 = \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda^{-1}$$\nThe strain energy density for uniaxial extension is therefore:\n$$W(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2} G (\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda^{-1} - 3)$$\nNote that this can also be written in terms of the crosslink density as $W(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2} \\nu R T (\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda^{-1} - 3)$, explicitly using the result from Part 1.\n\nThe problem states that unloading is quasi-static and non-dissipative. This implies that the deformation is perfectly elastic, and the stored strain energy is fully recoverable. The maximum recoverable work per unit volume, $W_{\\text{recov}}$, is the strain energy density evaluated at the maximum stretch ratio, $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} = W(\\lambda_{\\max}) = \\frac{1}{2} G (\\lambda_{\\max}^2 + 2\\lambda_{\\max}^{-1} - 3)$$\nWe substitute the given values $G = 1.80 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max} = 2.2$:\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} = \\frac{1}{2} (1.80 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}) \\left( (2.2)^2 + \\frac{2}{2.2} - 3 \\right)$$\nNow we perform the calculation:\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} = (0.90 \\times 10^{6}) \\left( 4.84 + \\frac{2}{2.2} - 3 \\right)$$\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} = (0.90 \\times 10^{6}) \\left( 1.84 + 0.90909... \\right)$$\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} = (0.90 \\times 10^{6}) \\left( 2.749090... \\right)$$\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} \\approx 2474181.81... \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of kilojoules per cubic meter ($\\mathrm{kJ \\ m^{-3}}$) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} \\approx 2474.18181... \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ m^{-3}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$W_{\\text{recov}} = 2474 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ m^{-3}}$$\nThis is the final result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2474}$$", "id": "2522109"}, {"introduction": "For a shape-memory polymer to be useful, we must be able to control its activation precisely.

The stress is thus given by:\n$$\n\\sigma(z,t) = E(T(z)) \\left[ \\varepsilon(z,t) - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $E(T)$ is the temperature-dependent Young's modulus, which switches between a high value in the glassy state ($E_{\\mathrm{glass}}$) and a low value in the rubbery state ($E_{\\mathrm{rubber}}$) at the glass transition temperature $T_g$:\n$$\nE(T) =\n\\begin{cases}\nE_{\\mathrm{glass}},  T  T_g \\\\\nE_{\\mathrm{rubber}},  T \\ge T_g\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe temperature field $T(z)$ is a prescribed linear function of the thickness coordinate $z$:\n$$\nT(z) = T_0 + g z\n$$\nwhere $T_0$ is the mid-plane temperature and $g$ is the through-thickness thermal gradient.\n\nThe evolution of the internal strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}$ during recovery is governed by first-order kinetics with a temperature-dependent relaxation time $\\tau(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t)}{\\mathrm{d} t} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t)}{\\tau(T(z))}\n$$\nThe relaxation time follows an Arrhenius law:\n$$\n\\tau(T) = \\tau_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_0$ is a pre-exponential factor, $Q$ is the activation energy, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. With the initial condition of a uniform programmed strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,0) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{prog}}$, the solution for the internal strain at any time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{prog}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(T(z))}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor a beam in a state of free recovery, there are no external forces or moments. Therefore, the resultant axial force $N(t)$ and bending moment $M(t)$ on any cross-section must be zero:\n$$\nN(t) = \\int_A \\sigma(z,t) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = b \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma(z,t) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = 0\n$$\n$$\nM(t) = \\int_A \\sigma(z,t) z \\, \\mathrm{d}A = b \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma(z,t) z \\, \\mathrm{d}z = 0\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $b$ is the beam width.\n\nSubstituting the constitutive and kinematic relations into the equilibrium equations, we obtain a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $\\varepsilon_0(t)$ and $\\kappa(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} E(T(z)) \\left[ \\varepsilon_0(t) - \\kappa(t) z - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t) \\right] \\mathrm{d}z = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} E(T(z)) \\left[ \\varepsilon_0(t) - \\kappa(t) z - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t) \\right] z \\, \\mathrm{d}z = 0\n$$\nRearranging these equations yields the matrix system:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\int E(z) \\mathrm{d}z  -\\int E(z) z \\mathrm{d}z \\\\\n\\int E(z) z \\mathrm{d}z  -\\int E(z) z^2 \\mathrm{d}z\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_0(t) \\\\\n\\kappa(t)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\int E(z) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t) \\mathrm{d}z \\\\\n\\int E(z) \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z,t) z \\mathrm{d}z\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe constant width $b$ cancels from all terms and does not affect the solution for $\\varepsilon_0$ and $\\kappa$.\n\nTo solve this system numerically, we discretize the beam thickness into $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$ layers of equal thickness $\\Delta z = h / N_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The integrals are approximated using the midpoint rule, where the value of the integrand is evaluated at the center $z_i$ of each layer $i$. The discrete form of the equations is:\n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{th}}} E_i \\Delta z \\right) \\varepsilon_0(t) - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{th}}} E_i z_i \\Delta z \\right) \\kappa(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{th}}} E_i \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in},i}(t) \\Delta z\n$$\n$$\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{th}}} E_i z_i \\Delta z \\right) \\varepsilon_0(t) - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{th}}} E_i z_i^2 \\Delta z \\right) \\kappa(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{th}}} E_i \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in},i}(t) z_i \\Delta z\n$$\nwhere $E_i = E(T(z_i))$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in},i}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in}}(z_i, t)$. The factor $\\Delta z$ is common and can be removed. The problem statement includes the width $b$ in the weights $w_i = b \\Delta z$, which is also valid as this constant factor appears on both sides of each equation and cancels. For numerical implementation, it is simplest to omit both $b$ and $\\Delta z$ from the formulation of the linear system.\n\nThe algorithm for computing the curvature history is as follows:\n1.  Define all physical and numerical parameters: $T_g, E_{\\mathrm{glass}}, E_{\\mathrm{rubber}}, \\tau_0, Q, R, b, h, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{prog}}, N_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n2.  Define the set of time points $t$ for which the curvature is to be computed.\n3.  For each test case, defined by a pair $(T_0, g)$:\n    a. Create a vector of $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$ layer midpoints $z_i$ from $-h/2 + \\Delta z/2$ to $h/2 - \\Delta z/2$.\n    b. Calculate the temperature vector $T_i = T_0 + g z_i$.\n    c. Calculate the modulus vector $E_i$ based on whether $T_i  T_g$.\n    d. Calculate the relaxation time vector $\\tau_i = \\tau_0 \\exp(Q / (RT_i))$.\n    e. For each time $t$ in the required set:\n        i. Calculate the internal strain vector $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in},i}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{prog}} \\exp(-t/\\tau_i)$.\n        ii. Assemble the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and the $2 \\times 1$ right-hand-side vector $\\mathbf{B}$:\n           $$\n           A_{11} = \\sum_i E_i, \\quad A_{12} = -\\sum_i E_i z_i\n           $$\n           $$\n           A_{21} = \\sum_i E_i z_i, \\quad A_{22} = -\\sum_i E_i z_i^2\n           $$\n           $$\n           B_1 = \\sum_i E_i \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in},i}(t), \\quad B_2 = \\sum_i E_i \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{in},i}(t) z_i\n           $$\n        iii. Solve the linear system $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{B}$ for the vector $\\mathbf{x} = [\\varepsilon_0(t), \\kappa(t)]^T$.\n        iv. Extract the curvature $\\kappa(t) = x_2$.\n    f. Collect the computed curvature values for all specified times.\n4.  Format the results from all test cases into the specified string format.\n\nThe provided numerical parameters are physically reasonable and the discretization of $N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 201$ is sufficiently fine for convergence. The linear system remains non-singular as its determinant is related to the effective axial and bending stiffnesses of the composite beam, which are always positive. This confirms the well-posed nature of the problem. The implementation will proceed as outlined.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the bending-recovery curvature history of a shape-memory polymer beam.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical and numerical parameters\n    T_g = 333.0  # Glass transition temperature [K]\n    E_glass = 1.5e9  # Young's modulus (glassy) [Pa]\n    E_rubber = 5.0e6  # Young's modulus (rubbery) [Pa]\n    tau_0 = 6.0e-13  # Relaxation time prefactor [s]\n    Q = 8.0e4  # Activation energy [J/mol]\n    R = 8.314  # Universal gas constant [J/(mol*K)]\n    b = 1.0e-2  # Beam width [m]\n    h = 1.0e-3  # Beam thickness [m]\n    eps_prog = 0.05  # Programmed strain [-]\n    N_th = 201  # Number of thickness layers\n    t_samples = np.array([0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0, 60.0])  # Time points [s]\n\n    # Test cases: (T0, g)\n    test_cases = [\n        (323.0, 0.0),            # Case 1: Uniform, below Tg\n        (333.0, 1.0e5),          # Case 2: Strong positive gradient\n        (333.0, -1.0e5),         # Case 3: Strong negative gradient\n        (363.0, 2.0e4)           # Case 4: Moderate positive gradient, above Tg\n    ]\n\n    # Discretize the beam thickness\n    dz = h / N_th\n    # z-coordinates of layer midpoints\n    z = np.linspace(-h / 2 + dz / 2, h / 2 - dz / 2, N_th)\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for T0, g in test_cases:\n        case_curvatures = []\n\n        # Calculate time-independent properties for the case\n        # Temperature profile through the thickness\n        T_vec = T0 + g * z\n        \n        # Modulus profile based on temperature\n        E_vec = np.where(T_vec  T_g, E_glass, E_rubber)\n        \n        # Relaxation time profile\n        # Protect against division by zero if T=0, though not expected here\n        T_vec_safe = np.maximum(T_vec, 1e-6) # Ensure T is positive\n        tau_vec = tau_0 * np.exp(Q / (R * T_vec_safe))\n\n        # Assemble the time-independent parts of the linear system matrix A\n        # The factor b*dz is common to all terms and can be cancelled.\n        C11 = np.sum(E_vec)\n        C12 = -np.sum(E_vec * z)\n        # C21 = np.sum(E_vec * z) which is -C12\n        C22 = -np.sum(E_vec * z**2)\n        \n        # The matrix A is time-independent\n        A = np.array([[C11, C12], [-C12, C22]])\n\n        for t in t_samples:\n            # Calculate time-dependent properties\n            # Internal strain profile at time t\n            # Handle t=0 case where exp(-inf) can be NaN if tau is 0. \n            # Here tau is always positive, but it is good practice.\n            if t == 0.0:\n                eps_in_vec = np.full_like(z, eps_prog)\n            else:\n                eps_in_vec = eps_prog * np.exp(-t / tau_vec)\n\n            # Assemble the right-hand-side vector B\n            RHS1 = np.sum(E_vec * eps_in_vec)\n            RHS2 = np.sum(E_vec * eps_in_vec * z)\n            B = np.array([RHS1, RHS2])\n\n            # Solve the linear system A * [eps0, kappa]^T = B\n            # Check for singularity, though not expected for this problem\n            if np.linalg.det(A) == 0:\n                # Handle special symmetric cases where off-diagonals are zero\n                if C22 != 0:\n                    kappa = B[1] / C22 if A[1,1] != 0 else 0.0\n                else:\n                    kappa = 0.0 # Bending stiffness is zero, no curvature\n            else:\n                solution = np.linalg.solve(A, B)\n                kappa = solution[1]\n            \n            case_curvatures.append(f\"{kappa:.6f}\")\n\n        all_results.append(f\"[{','.join(case_curvatures)}]\")\n\n    # Format the final output string\n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(all_results)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "answer": "[[0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000],[0.000000,-0.122176,-0.301549,-0.370383,-0.385732,-0.404286,-0.407771],[0.000000,0.122176,0.301549,0.370383,0.385732,0.404286,0.407771],[0.000000,-0.003316,-0.027056,-0.076241,-0.106684,-0.169134,-0.207907]]", "id": "2522131"}]}
