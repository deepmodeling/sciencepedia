Note that a positive $j_s(0)$ denotes current flowing into $N$ from the interface.\n$j_s(0) = A + \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}J_c = \\gamma B$. Thus,\n$$\nj_s(0) = \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}J_c \\frac{\\gamma (\\cosh(t_N/\\lambda_N) - 1)}{\\gamma \\cosh(t_N/\\lambda_N) + \\sinh(t_N/\\lambda_N)}\n$$\nThe torque-effective absorbed spin current is a fraction $(1-p_{\\mathrm{sf}})$ of the magnitude of the spin current flowing from $N$ to $F$, which is $|-j_s(0)|$. Since all parameters in the expression for $j_s(0)$ are positive, $j_s(0)>0$, so $|-j_s(0)|=j_s(0)$.\n$$\nJ_{s,\\text{eff}} = (1-p_{\\mathrm{sf}}) j_s(0) = (1-p_{\\mathrm{sf}}) \\theta_{\\mathrm{SH}}J_c \\frac{\\gamma (\\cosh(t_N/\\lambda_N) - 1)}{\\gamma \\cosh(t_N/\\lambda_N) + \\sinh(t_N/\\lambda_N)}\n$$\nFor the ideal case, $G_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}^{\\ast}\\to\\infty$ (so $\\gamma\\to\\infty$) and $p_{\\mathrm{sf}}=0$.
