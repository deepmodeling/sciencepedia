It is a standard problem in the theory of strongly correlated electron systems. We shall now proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires a variational treatment of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model within the Gutzwiller–Brinkman–Rice (GBR) framework, which provides the exact ground-state energy in the limit of infinite dimensions relevant to Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). The total energy per site, $E$, is a function of the double occupancy, $d = \\langle \\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle$. It is comprised of two parts: the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n$$\nE(d) = E_{kin} + E_{pot}\n$$\nThe potential energy per site is directly given by the Hubbard interaction term:\n$$\nE_{pot} = U \\langle \\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle = U d\n$$\nIn the Gutzwiller approximation, the kinetic energy is renormalized by a factor, which in this context is the quasiparticle weight $Z$. The kinetic energy is thus $E_{kin} = Z E_{0}^{kin}$, where $E_{0}^{kin}$ is the kinetic energy of the non-interacting system. The variational energy per site is:\n$$\nE(d) = Z E_{0}^{kin} + U d\n$$\nFor the half-filled case, the Brinkman-Rice analysis of the Gutzwiller wavefunction gives the quasiparticle weight $Z$ as a function of the double occupancy $d$:\n$$\nZ(d) = 8d(1-2d)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for the metallic phase where $d > 0$. The non-interacting state ($U=0$) corresponds to $d = \\frac{1}{4}$, which gives $Z=1$, as expected. The Mott insulating state is approached as $d \\to 0$, which leads to $Z \\to 0$.\n\nOur first step is to calculate the non-interacting kinetic energy per site, $E_{0}^{kin}$. The provided non-interacting density of states (DOS) per spin is $\\rho_{0}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{2}{\\pi D^{2}} \\sqrt{D^{2} - \\varepsilon^{2}}$ for $|\\varepsilon| \\le D$.

The metal-insulator transition (Mott transition) occurs when the quasiparticle weight $Z$ vanishes. According to the formula $Z=8d(1-2d)$, $Z$ becomes zero when $d$ becomes zero (for the solution connected to the metallic state).
