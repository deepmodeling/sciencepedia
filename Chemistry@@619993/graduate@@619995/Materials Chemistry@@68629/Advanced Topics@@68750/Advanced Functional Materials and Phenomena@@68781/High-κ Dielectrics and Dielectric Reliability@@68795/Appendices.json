We proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental starting point is the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation for the transmission probability, $T_{WKB}$, for an electron tunneling through a one-dimensional potential barrier $V(x)$. The current density $J$ is proportional to this probability. At zero temperature, electrons tunnel at the Fermi level, which we set as the zero-energy reference, $E=0$.

Substituting this into the previous equation gives the area scaling law for the survival function:\n$$S_A(t) = \\left( [S_{A_0}(t)]^{\\delta A / A_0} \\right)^{A/\\delta A} = [S_{A_0}(t)]^{A/A_0}$$\n\nThe problem further assumes that the intrinsic time-to-breakdown follows a Weibull distribution. For the reference area $A_0$, the CDF is given by:\n$$F_{A_0}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left( -\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right)$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the shape parameter (or Weibull modulus) and $\\eta_0$ is the scale parameter (characteristic lifetime) for area $A_0$. The corresponding survival function is:\n$$S_{A_0}(t) = 1 - F_{A_0}(t) = \\exp\\left( -\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute this Weibull survival function into the area scaling law:\n$$S_A(t) = \\left[ \\exp\\left( -\\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right) \\right]^{A/A_0} = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{A}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right)$$\nThe cumulative failure probability for a device of area $A$ is therefore:\n$$F_A(t) = 1 - S_A(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left( - \\frac{A}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{t}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right)$$\nThis equation shows that the failure distribution for any area $A$ is also a Weibull distribution, but with a new scale parameter $\\eta_A = \\eta_0 (A_0/A)^{1/\\beta}$, while the shape parameter $\\beta$ remains constant, as stipulated.\n\nWe must now derive the area-scaling relation for quantiles. A quantile $t_p$ is the time at which the cumulative failure probability is equal to a fixed value $p$. For an area $A$, this is defined by the relation $F_A(t_p) = p$.\n$$p = 1 - \\exp\\left( - \\frac{A}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{t_p}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right)$$\nWe solve for $t_p$:\n$$1-p = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{A}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{t_p}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta} \\right)$$\n$$\\ln(1-p) = - \\frac{A}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{t_p}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta}$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right) = \\frac{A}{A_0} \\left(\\frac{t_p}{\\eta_0}\\right)^{\\beta}$$\n$$t_p^{\\beta} = \\eta_0^{\\beta} \\frac{A_0}{A} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)$$\nThis equation relates the time to a given percentile failure $p$ with the device area $A$. Now, consider two populations with areas $A_1$ and $A_2$. We can write the expression for the same quantile $t_p$ for each:\n$$t_p(A_1)^{\\beta} = \\eta_0^{\\beta} \\frac{A_0}{A_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)$$\n$$t_p(A_2)^{\\beta} = \\eta_0^{\\beta} \\frac{A_0}{A_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)$$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations, the terms involving the reference device ($\\eta_0$, $A_0$) and the probability $p$ cancel out:\n$$\\frac{t_p(A_1)^{\\beta}}{t_p(A_2)^{\\beta}} = \\frac{\\eta_0^{\\beta} \\frac{A_0}{A_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)}{\\eta_0^{\\beta} \\frac{A_0}{A_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{t_p(A_1)}{t_p(A_2)} \\right)^{\\beta} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$$\nTaking the $\\beta$-th root of both sides gives the final area-scaling relation for quantiles:\n$$\\frac{t_p(A_1)}{t_p(A_2)} = \\left(\\frac{A_2}{A_1}\\right)^{1/\\beta}$$\nThis relation is independent of the quantile $p$, which is a key prediction of the weakest-link Weibull model.\n\nNext, we analyze the provided data. The areas are:\n$A_1 = (100 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = (10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n$A_2 = (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe ratio of the areas is:\n$$\\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}{10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = 100$$\nThe data provides two sets of quantiles.\nFor the $10\\%$ quantile ($p = 0.1$):\n$t_{0.1}(A_1) = 2000\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$t_{0.1}(A_2) = 200\\,\\mathrm{s}$\nThe ratio is $$\\frac{t_{0.1}(A_1)}{t_{0.1}(A_2)} = \\frac{2000}{200} = 10$$\n\nFor the $50\\%$ quantile ($p = 0.5$):\n$t_{0.5}(A_1) = 5000\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$t_{0.5}(A_2) = 500\\,\\mathrm{s}$\nThe ratio is $$\\frac{t_{0.5}(A_1)}{t_{0.5}(A_2)} = \\frac{5000}{500} = 10$$\n\nThe observation that the ratio of quantile times is constant ($10$) for different quantiles ($10\\%$ and $50\\%$) is entirely consistent with the prediction of the weakest-link Weibull model.\n\nWe now use this result to compute the Weibull shape parameter $\\beta$. We substitute the known ratios into our derived scaling relation:\n$$10 = (100)^{1/\\beta}$$\nTo solve for $\\beta$, we can take the logarithm of both sides. Using the base-$10$ logarithm is most direct:\n$$\\log_{10}(10) = \\log_{10}\\left(100^{1/\\beta}\\right)$$\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\log_{10}(100)$$\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\log_{10}(10^2)$$\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\cdot 2$$\n$$\\beta = 2$$\nThe value of the Weibull shape parameter is exactly $2$. The problem requires this to be reported to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "2490862"}]}
