It is a standard exercise in solid-state physics, applicable to the study of photonic crystals. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first step is to determine the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$, from the given real-space primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a(1, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$. The definition of the reciprocal lattice vectors in two dimensions ($2$D) is given by the relation $\\mathbf{b}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{j} = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nLet the reciprocal vectors be represented in Cartesian coordinates as $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = (b_{1x}, b_{1y})$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = (b_{2x}, b_{2y})$. We solve the system of linear equations derived from the defining relation.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$:\nThe condition $\\mathbf{b}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} = 2\\pi$ implies $b_{1x} \\cdot a + b_{1y} \\cdot 0 = 2\\pi$, which gives $b_{1x} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\nThe condition $\\mathbf{b}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = 0$ implies $b_{1x} \\cdot \\frac{a}{2} + b_{1y} \\cdot \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0$. Substituting the value of $b_{1x}$, we have $(\\frac{2\\pi}{a})(\\frac{a}{2}) + b_{1y}(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 0$, which simplifies to $\\pi + b_{1y}(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 0$. Solving for $b_{1y}$ yields $b_{1y} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThus, the first reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, -\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$:\nThe condition $\\mathbf{b}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} = 0$ implies $b_{2x} \\cdot a + b_{2y} \\cdot 0 = 0$, which gives $b_{2x} = 0$.\nThe condition $\\mathbf{b}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = 2\\pi$ implies $b_{2x} \\cdot \\frac{a}{2} + b_{2y} \\cdot \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2\\pi$. Substituting the value of $b_{2x}$, we get $0 + b_{2y}(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 2\\pi$, which gives $b_{2y} = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThus, the second reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = (0, \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(0, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\nThe first Brillouin zone (BZ) is the Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice, centered at the origin.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a scaling law for the eigenfrequencies of a photonic crystal. We begin from fundamental principles, namely the time-harmonic, source-free Maxwell's equations in a nonmagnetic medium with uniform permeability $\\mu_0$ and a spatially periodic relative permittivity $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nMaxwell's curl equations are:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega\\mu_0\\mathbf{H} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = -i\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{E} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$ are the complex amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\\varepsilon_0$ and $\\mu_0$ are the vacuum permittivity and permeability, respectively, and $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_0\\mu_0}$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nWe can decouple these equations to obtain an eigenvalue equation for the magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$.

According to the Bloch theorem, the solutions to the wave equation in such a periodic medium can be written in the form:\n$$ \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{h_k}(\\mathbf{r}) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{h_k}(\\mathbf{r})$ has the same periodicity as the lattice, $\\mathbf{h_k}(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{h_k}(\\mathbf{r})$, and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the Bloch wavevector. Substituting this into the master equation, the curl operator $\\nabla$ acting on the Bloch function $\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{r})$ can be replaced by $(\\nabla + i\\mathbf{k})$ acting on the periodic part $\\mathbf{h_k}(\\mathbf{r})$.

The operator on the left, let's call it $\\mathcal{L}_{\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}}$, depends only on the reduced wavevector $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ and the permittivity profile as a function of the reduced coordinates, $\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})$. The solutions yield the dimensionless eigenvalues $(\\omega a / c)^2$ and the corresponding dimensionless periodic eigenfunctions $\\mathbf{h}_{\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}}(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})$.\n\nNow consider the scaled crystal with lattice constant $a' = sa$ and permittivity profile $\\varepsilon'(\\mathbf{r}) = \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}/s)$.

The problem requires a comparison at the same reduced wavevector, so we set $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}' = \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$. This preserves the Bloch phase factor across a primitive cell in reduced coordinates.\n\nLet us examine the permittivity profile of the scaled crystal in its reduced coordinates:\n$$ \\varepsilon'(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}') = \\varepsilon'(a'\\boldsymbol{\\rho}') = \\varepsilon'((sa)\\boldsymbol{\\rho}') $$\nUsing the definition $\\varepsilon'(\\mathbf{r}) = \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}/s)$, we set $\\mathbf{r} = sa\\boldsymbol{\\rho}'$:\n$$ \\varepsilon'(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}') = \\varepsilon\\left(\\frac{sa\\boldsymbol{\\rho}'}{s}\\right) = \\varepsilon(a\\boldsymbol{\\rho}') $$\nThis has the same functional form as the original permittivity in its reduced coordinates, $\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) = \\varepsilon(a\\boldsymbol{\\rho})$. Therefore, in the space of reduced coordinates, the dielectric function is identical for both the original and scaled systems: $\\varepsilon'(\\cdot) = \\varepsilon(\\cdot)$.\n\nSubstituting $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}'=\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$, $a'=sa$, and $\\varepsilon'(\\cdot) = \\varepsilon(\\cdot)$ into the scaled dimensionless equation, we get:\n$$ (\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}} + i\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})} (\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}} + i\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) \\times \\mathbf{h}'_{\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}}(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) \\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})sa}{c}\\right)^2 \\mathbf{h}'_{\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}}(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}) $$\nNotice that the operator on the left is exactly the same operator $\\mathcal{L}_{\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}}$ as in the original problem. Since the operator and the periodic boundary conditions on the reduced unit cell are identical, the set of eigenvalues must also be identical.\nBy equating the eigenvalues of the original and scaled systems:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\omega(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})a}{c}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})sa}{c}\\right)^2 $$\nSince frequencies are positive, we can take the square root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})a}{c} = \\frac{\\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})sa}{c} $$\n$$ \\omega(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) = s \\cdot \\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) $$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R(s) = \\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})/\\omega(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})$. From the above relation, we find:\n$$ R(s) = \\frac{\\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})}{\\omega(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})} = \\frac{1}{s} $$\n\nFinally, we must justify the invariance properties of the normalized frequency $\\omega a / (2\\pi c)$ and discuss the roles of the dimensionless eigenvalue and Bloch conditions.\nThe dimensionless eigenvalue that governs the photonic bands is $(\\omega a / c)^2$. Its square root, $\\omega a / c$, or the commonly used normalized frequency $\\tilde{\\omega} = \\omega a / (2\\pi c)$, is the quantity whose constancy we must explain. Our derivation showed that for any eigenmode, the eigenvalues of the dimensionless operator must be the same for the original and the scaled systems:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})a}{c} = \\frac{\\omega'(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})a'}{c} $$\nThis equality explicitly demonstrates that the normalized frequency is an invariant of the scaling transformation, provided the systems are compared at the same reduced wavevector $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$. This is why a single photonic band diagram, plotted as normalized frequency versus reduced wavevector, describes an entire family of geometrically similar crystals, differing only by the scale factor $s$.\n\nThe Bloch boundary conditions are central to this entire framework. By postulating the Bloch form of the solution, $\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{h_k}(\\mathbf{r}) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, we are able to transform the problem from an infinite domain into an eigenvalue problem on a single primitive cell. This introduces the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ into the differential operator. The subsequent non-dimensionalization with respect to the lattice constant $a$ naturally groups $\\omega$ with $a$ to form the dimensionless eigenvalue $(\\omega a / c)^2$, and $\\mathbf{k}$ with $a$ to form the reduced wavevector $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = a\\mathbf{k}$, which parameterizes the dimensionless operator. The condition to compare eigenfrequencies at the same $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ is a condition on the Bloch phase, which makes the dimensionless operators identical and leads directly to the scaling law and the invariance of the normalized frequency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{s}}$$", "id": "2509800"}, {"introduction": "Moving from ideal theory to practical application, the performance of a real photonic device is inevitably influenced by its environment.

The frequency $f_{B}$ is a function of the lattice constant, $a$, and the refractive index of the constituent silicon, $n$, both of which depend on temperature $T$.

We shall analyze each contribution separately.\n\nFirst, consider the contribution from thermal expansion. The problem states that Maxwell's equations for a photonic crystal exhibit a scaling property: a uniform spatial dilation by a factor $s$, i.e., $a \\mapsto s a$, results in a scaling of eigenfrequencies by $f \\mapsto f/s$. This implies that the frequency $f_{B}$ is inversely proportional to the lattice constant $a$, provided all other parameters such as refractive indices are held constant. We can write $f_{B} \\propto a^{-1}$. From this relationship, we can determine the partial derivative term. It is often more direct to work with logarithmic derivatives: $\\ln f_{B} = -\\ln a + C$, where $C$ is a constant. Differentiating with respect to $a$ gives $\\frac{1}{f_{B}}\\frac{\\partial f_{B}}{\\partial a} = -\\frac{1}{a}$.\nThe thermal expansion contribution to the fractional frequency shift is therefore:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{f_{B}}\\frac{df_{B}}{dT}\\right)_{\\text{exp}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{f_{B}}\\frac{\\partial f_{B}}{\\partial a}\\right) \\frac{da}{dT} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{a}\\right) \\frac{da}{dT} = -\\frac{1}{a}\\frac{da}{dT}\n$$\nThis is precisely the negative of the linear thermal expansion coefficient, $\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{1}{a}\\frac{da}{dT}$. Thus, the thermal expansion contribution is $-\\alpha$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the thermo-optic contribution. This arises from the change in the silicon refractive index $n$ with temperature. According to first-order electromagnetic perturbation theory, a small change in the dielectric function $\\delta\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r})$ results in a fractional frequency shift $\\frac{\\delta f}{f}$ given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta f}{f} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\int_{\\text{all}} \\delta\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}) |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}{\\int_{\\text{all}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}) |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})$ is the unperturbed electric field of the mode. In our system, the temperature change $\\delta T$ only modifies the dielectric function of silicon, $\\varepsilon_{Si} = n^2$. The change is $\\delta\\varepsilon_{Si} = \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{Si}}{dT} \\delta T$. We have $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{Si}}{dT} = \\frac{d(n^2)}{dT} = 2n\\frac{dn}{dT}$. So, $\\delta\\varepsilon_{Si} = 2n\\frac{dn}{dT}\\delta T$. The change $\\delta\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r})$ is zero in the air holes.\nSubstituting this into the perturbation formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta f_{B}}{f_{B}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\int_{\\text{Si}} \\left(2n\\frac{dn}{dT}\\delta T\\right) |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}{\\int_{\\text{all}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}) |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the numerator integral. Noting that $\\varepsilon_{Si}=n^2$, we write $|\\mathbf{E}|^2 = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{Si}}\\varepsilon_{Si}|\\mathbf{E}|^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta f_{B}}{f_{B}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{ \\left(2n\\frac{dn}{dT}\\delta T\\right) \\frac{1}{n^2} \\int_{\\text{Si}} \\varepsilon_{Si} |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}{\\int_{\\text{all}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}) |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\frac{dn}{dT}\\delta T\\right) \\frac{\\int_{\\text{Si}} \\varepsilon_{Si} |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}{\\int_{\\text{all}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r}) |\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})|^2 dV}\n$$\nThe problem defines the fraction of electric energy stored in the silicon as $\\gamma$.
