The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe linear magnetoelectric effect describes the induction of an electric polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ by an applied magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$, or conversely, the induction of a magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ by an applied electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. In the absence of an external electric field, the change in electric polarization, $\\Delta P_i$, due to an applied magnetic field, $H_j$, is given by the constitutive relation:\n$$ \\Delta P_i = \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{ij} H_j $$\nHere, $i, j$ represent the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), and $\\alpha_{ij}$ are the components of the linear magnetoelectric susceptibility tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n\nFor a uniaxial crystal with the symmetry axis oriented along the $z$-direction, and with fields applied only along this axis, the tensorial relation simplifies. We are interested in the longitudinal response, where the induced polarization is parallel to the applied field. In this specific case, the change in polarization along the $z$-axis, $\\Delta P_z$, is related to the magnetic field strength along the $z$-axis, $H_z$, by:\n$$ \\Delta P_z = \\alpha_{zz} H_z $$\nFrom this defining equation, the expression for the longitudinal magnetoelectric tensor element $\\alpha_{zz}$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_{zz} = \\frac{\\Delta P_z}{H_z} $$\nThe problem states that the magnetic susceptibility of the material is small. This allows for the approximation relating the internal magnetic field strength $H_z$ to the applied magnetic flux density $B_z$. The general relation is $B_z = \\mu_0 (H_z + M_z)$, where $M_z$ is the magnetization. For a material with small magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_m$, $M_z = \\chi_m H_z$, and if $\\chi_m \\ll 1$, then $M_z \\ll H_z$.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in the field of materials chemistry and physics concerning multiferroics. A solution will now be derived.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe generation of electric polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ by a noncollinear magnetic structure, as described in the problem, is governed by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) mechanism, also known as the spin-current model. For two neighboring magnetic ions at sites $i$ and $j$ with spins $\\mathbf{S}_i$ and $\\mathbf{S}_j$, the locally generated electric polarization dipole $\\mathbf{p}_{ij}$ is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_{ij} \\propto \\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\times (\\mathbf{S}_i \\times \\mathbf{S}_j)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{e}_{ij}$ is the unit vector pointing from site $i$ to site $j$. The macroscopic polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ is the vector sum of these local contributions. The problem specifies that the dominant interactions are between nearest neighbors along the crystallographic $b$-axis, so we set $\\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\parallel \\hat{b}$, where $\\hat{b}$ is the unit vector along the $b$-axis.\n\nThe term $(\\mathbf{S}_i \\times \\mathbf{S}_j)$ represents the local spin chirality. For a planar spin structure like a cycloid, where all spins rotate within a single plane, the vector $\\mathbf{S}_i \\times \\mathbf{S}_j$ for any pair of spins $(i, j)$ is always perpendicular to this plane. Let $\\hat{n}$ be the unit vector normal to the spin rotation plane. Then, the spin chirality term is parallel to $\\hat{n}$, i.e., $(\\mathbf{S}_i \\times \\mathbf{S}_j) \\parallel \\hat{n}$.\n\nThe expression for the polarization direction can therefore be simplified based on this symmetry:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} \\propto \\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\times \\hat{n}\n$$\nWe apply this simplified rule to the two specified conditions. We assume a right-handed crystallographic coordinate system $(a, b, c)$, such that $\\hat{a} \\times \\hat{b} = \\hat{c}$, $\\hat{b} \\times \\hat{c} = \\hat{a}$, and $\\hat{c} \\times \\hat{a} = \\hat{b}$.\n\n### Case 1: Zero Applied Magnetic Field ($H=0$)\n- **Bond direction**: The problem states the relevant bonds are along the $b$-axis, so $\\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\parallel \\hat{b}$.\n- **Spin plane**: In $0$ field, the spins rotate in the $bc$-plane.\n- **Normal to spin plane**: The normal vector $\\hat{n}$ to the $bc$-plane is parallel to the $a$-axis, so $\\hat{n} \\parallel \\hat{a}$.\n- **Polarization direction**: Using the cross product relation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} \\propto \\hat{b} \\times \\hat{a} = -\\hat{c}\n$$\nTherefore, in zero field, the spontaneous electric polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ is directed along the $c$-axis.\n\n### Case 2: Applied Magnetic Field $\\mathbf{H} \\parallel b$\n- **Bond direction**: This remains unchanged, $\\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\parallel \\hat{b}$.\n- **Spin plane**: The applied field $\\mathbf{H} \\parallel b$ induces a flop of the cycloid plane from the $bc$-plane to the $ab$-plane.\n- **Normal to spin plane**: The normal vector $\\hat{n}$ to the new $ab$-plane is parallel to the $c$-axis, so $\\hat{n} \\parallel \\hat{c}$.\n- **Polarization direction**: The resulting polarization is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} \\propto \\hat{b} \\times \\hat{c} = \\hat{a}\n$$\nTherefore, under an applied field $\\mathbf{H} \\parallel b$, the electric polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ flops from the $c$-axis to the $a$-axis.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each of the given options based on this derivation.\n\n**A.

In $0$ field, $\\mathbf{P}\\parallel b$; for $\\mathbf{H}\\parallel b$, $\\mathbf{P}$ remains $\\parallel b$ because the dominant bond direction is $\\parallel b$.**\n- The $0$-field polarization direction $\\mathbf{P} \\parallel b$ is incorrect. Our derivation shows $\\mathbf{P} \\parallel c$. From the fundamental formula $\\mathbf{P} \\propto \\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\times \\hat{n}$, $\\mathbf{P}$ must be perpendicular to $\\mathbf{e}_{ij}$. Since $\\mathbf{e}_{ij} \\parallel b$, $\\mathbf{P}$ cannot be parallel to $b$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In $0$ field, $\\mathbf{P}\\parallel c$; for $\\mathbf{H}\\parallel b$, $\\mathbf{P}$ increases in magnitude but stays $\\parallel c$ because the spin chirality axis is unchanged.**\n- The $0$-field polarization direction $\\mathbf{P} \\parallel c$ is correct.\n- The claim that $\\mathbf{P}$ stays parallel to $c$ is incorrect. This would require the normal to the spin plane $\\hat{n}$ to remain unchanged, which contradicts the stated flop of the spin plane from $bc$ to $ab$. The normal to the spin plane (which dictates the direction of the spin chirality vector) changes from being parallel to $a$ to being parallel to $c$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In $0$ field, $\\mathbf{P}\\parallel a$; for $\\mathbf{H}\\parallel b$, $\\mathbf{P}$ flops to $\\parallel c$ due to the cross product between the bond direction and spin chirality.**\n- The $0$-field polarization direction $\\mathbf{P} \\parallel a$ is incorrect. Our derivation shows $\\mathbf{P} \\parallel c$.\n- The prediction for the field-induced polarization direction is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.
