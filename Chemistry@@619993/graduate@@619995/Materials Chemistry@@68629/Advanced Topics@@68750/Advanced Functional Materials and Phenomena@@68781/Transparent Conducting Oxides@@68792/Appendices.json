The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and constants to derive a unique, meaningful solution. There are no logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or unscientific premises.\n\nThe problem requires an estimation of the critical donor density, $n_{c}$, for the insulator-metal transition in zinc oxide (ZnO). The theoretical basis for this estimation is the Mott criterion, which postulates that a material transitions from an insulating to a metallic state when the average distance between charge carriers becomes comparable to the spatial extent of their localized wavefunctions.\n\nThe problem specifies that the donor electrons are modeled as hydrogenic impurities. The spatial extent of the ground state wavefunction for such a donor is characterized by the effective Bohr radius, $a_{B}^{\\*}$.

Since the physical parameters $A$, $B$, and $\\Theta$ must be positive, we will impose bounds $(0, \\infty)$ during the fitting procedure to ensure physical results.\n\nFor mechanism dominance classification, we must evaluate the relative contributions of the two scattering mechanisms using the fitted parameters $(A_{\\mathrm{fit}}, B_{\\mathrm{fit}}, \\Theta_{\\mathrm{fit}})$. The inverse-mobility contributions at a given temperature $T$ are:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{ii}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ii}}(T)} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\mathrm{fit}} T^{3/2}}\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{pop}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{pop}}(T)} = \\frac{1}{B_{\\mathrm{fit}} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{fit}}}{T}\\right) - 1\\right)}\n$$\nThe fractional contribution of polar optical phonon scattering is defined as:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{pop}}(T) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{pop}}(T)}{c_{\\mathrm{ii}}(T) + c_{\\mathrm{pop}}(T)}\n$$\nWe then compute the uniform average of this fraction, $\\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{pop}}$, over the specified temperature grid for each test case. The dominance code $d$ is assigned based on the following rule:\n$$\nd = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{pop}} \\ge 0.5 \\quad \\text{(polar optical phonon dominated)} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\bar{f}_{\\mathrm{pop}} < 0.5 \\quad \\text{(ionized impurity dominated)} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe final step is to implement a program that performs these calculations for each test case, rounds the fitted parameters to six significant figures, and prints the results in the required format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef round_to_sf(x, sf):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a number to a specified number of significant figures.\n    \"\"\"\n    if x == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    # Calculate the position of the most significant digit\n    # Then round to the correct number of decimal places\n    return round(x, sf - 1 - int(np.floor(np.log10(abs(x)))))\n\ndef mobility_model(T, A, B, Theta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Combined mobility model based on Matthiessen's rule.\n    \n    T: Temperature (K)\n    A: Ionized impurity mobility prefactor (cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 K^-3/2)\n    B: Polar optical phonon mobility prefactor (cm^2 V^-1 s^-1)\n    Theta: Characteristic LO phonon temperature (K)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Handle potential overflow in exp and division by zero if T is 0\n    # Add a small epsilon to denominator terms to avoid division by zero\n    epsilon = 1e-30\n    \n    # Ionized impurity contribution\n    # mu_ii = A * T^(3/2)\n    inv_mu_ii = 1.0 / (A * T**1.5 + epsilon)\n    \n    # Polar optical phonon contribution\n    # mu_pop = B * (exp(Theta/T) - 1)\n    exp_term = np.exp(Theta / T)\n    inv_mu_pop = 1.0 / (B * (exp_term - 1.0) + epsilon)\n    \n    # Total mobility\n    inv_mu_total = inv_mu_ii + inv_mu_pop\n    mu_total = 1.0 / inv_mu_total\n    \n    return mu_total\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function to process test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"temps\": np.array([50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150]),\n            \"params\": (0.08, 1500, 700)\n        },\n        {\n            \"temps\": np.array([300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600]),\n            \"params\": (4.0, 500, 700)\n        },\n        {\n            \"temps\": np.array([150, 225, 300, 375, 450, 525, 600]),\n            \"params\": (1.2, 800, 700)\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        T_data = case[\"temps\"]\n        A_true, B_true, Theta_true = case[\"params\"]\n        \n        # 1.
