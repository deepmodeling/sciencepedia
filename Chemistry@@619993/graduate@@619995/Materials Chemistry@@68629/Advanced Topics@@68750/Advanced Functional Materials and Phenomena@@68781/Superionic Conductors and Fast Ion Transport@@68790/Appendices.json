This requires calculating the ionic conductivity $\\sigma_{\\text{ion}}$ and the lithium-ion transference number $t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+}$ for each material.\n\nThe ionic conductivity is derived from the total and electronic conductivities: $\\sigma_{\\text{ion}} = \\sigma_{\\text{total}} - \\sigma_e$.\nThe transference number is then calculated as $t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+} = \\sigma_{\\text{ion}} / \\sigma_{\\text{total}}$. Alternatively, $t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+} = (\\sigma_{\\text{total}} - \\sigma_e) / \\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 1 - (\\sigma_e / \\sigma_{\\text{total}})$.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Li_{10}GeP_2S_{12}}$**\n- Given: $\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$ and $\\sigma_e < 1 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$.\n- The electronic conductivity is at least six orders of magnitude smaller than the total conductivity.

This criterion is satisfied.\n- Criterion 2 ($t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+} \\approx 1$): $t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+} = 1 - (\\sigma_e / \\sigma_{\\text{total}})$. The ratio $\\sigma_e / \\sigma_{\\text{total}}$ is less than $(1 \\times 10^{-8}) / (1.2 \\times 10^{-2}) \\approx 8.3 \\times 10^{-7}$. This value is exceptionally small, so $t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+}$ is extremely close to $1$. This criterion is satisfied.\n- Conclusion: Both criteria are met. $\\mathrm{Li_{10}GeP_2S_{12}}$ is a superionic conductor.\n\n**Analysis of LLZO ($\\mathrm{Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}}$)**\n- Given: $\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$ and $\\sigma_e < 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$.\n- The electronic conductivity is more than five orders of magnitude smaller than the total conductivity and is negligible.\n- Ionic conductivity: $\\sigma_{\\text{ion}} = \\sigma_{\\text{total}} - \\sigma_e \\approx \\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$.\n- Criterion 1 ($\\sigma_{\\text{ion}} \\gtrsim 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$): $6.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$ is less than $10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$ (which is $10 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$).

This value is negligible, thus $t_{\\mathrm{Li}^+}$ is very close to $1$. This criterion is satisfied.\n- Conclusion: Since LLZO fails the ionic conductivity benchmark, it is not classified as a superionic conductor under the given criteria.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Li_3YCl_6}$**\n- Given: $\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$ and $\\sigma_e \\approx 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$.\n- The electronic conductivity is more than four orders of magnitude smaller than the total conductivity.\n- Ionic conductivity: $\\sigma_{\\text{ion}} = \\sigma_{\\text{total}} - \\sigma_e = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 1 \\times 10^{-7} = (2 - 0.0001) \\times 10^{-3} = 1.9999 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$.\n- Criterion 1 ($\\sigma_{\\text{ion}} \\gtrsim 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$): $1.9999 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$ is greater than $10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,cm^{-1}}$.

Our analysis showed that $\\mathrm{Li_3YCl_6}$ meets both criteria for a superionic conductor. The premise for its failure is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

Then, a numerical value for $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ must be computed for a specific oxide system.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles of geometry and steric exclusion. We consider a migrating cation of radius $r$ and three static anions of radius $R_{\\mathrm{A}}$. The centers of the three anions form an equilateral triangle in a plane, with side length $s$. The bottleneck radius, $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is defined as the maximum radius of a cation that can pass through the aperture formed by these three anions without any geometric overlap.\n\nThe point of maximum constriction along the migration path through this window lies at the geometric center of the equilateral triangle. Let us denote the anion centers as vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, and the center of the triangle as $O$. A cation attempting to pass through the window will experience the most severe steric hindrance when its center is at $O$. Therefore, the bottleneck radius $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ corresponds to the radius of a sphere centered at $O$ that is simultaneously tangent to the three spherical anions centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nThe distance from the center $O$ to any vertex of an equilateral triangle (the circumradius of the triangle) must be calculated.

The centroid $O$ is located at a distance of $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the height from any vertex, measured along the median.

The cation, with the bottleneck radius $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is centered at $O$ and is tangent to the anion of radius $R_{\\mathrm{A}}$ centered at $A$. The condition for tangency is therefore:\n$$ d_{OA} = r_{\\mathrm{b}} + R_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\n\nBy substituting the geometric expression for $d_{OA}$ into the tangency condition, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = r_{\\mathrm{b}} + R_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\n\nSolving for the bottleneck radius $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ yields the required analytical expression:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} - R_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\nThis expression is derived strictly from geometric first principles, as required.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numerical value of $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ for an oxide framework with the given parameters:\n- Anion radius: $R_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1.40$ Å\n- Anion-anion edge length: $s = 2.90$ Å\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{2.90}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1.40 $$\nAll quantities are in units of ångströms (Å), so the result for $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ will also be in ångströms.\n\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} \\approx \\frac{2.90}{1.73205} - 1.40 $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} \\approx 1.67431 - 1.40 $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} \\approx 0.27431 \\text{ Å} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
