Your numerical answer should be only the dimensionless size-matching ratio.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state chemistry and crystallography, specifically concerning the structure of perovskite oxides. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless ratio for geometric compatibility in an ideal cubic perovskite lattice, $\\mathrm{ABO_3}$, followed by its calculation for lead magnesium niobate, $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Mg}_{1/3}\\mathrm{Nb}_{2/3})\\mathrm{O}_{3}$. This ratio is known as the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, denoted by the symbol $t$.\n\nWe model the structure using the hard-sphere approximation, where ions are spheres with specific radii in contact with their nearest neighbors. Let the lattice parameter of the ideal cubic unit cell be $a$.\n\nFirst, consider the corner-sharing $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ octahedra. The $\\mathrm{B}$-site cation is located at the body-center of the cube, $(a/2, a/2, a/2)$, and the $\\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ anions are at the face centers, such as $(a/2, a/2, 0)$. The distance between the center of the $\\mathrm{B}$ cation and an adjacent $\\mathrm{O}$ anion is half the lattice parameter, $a/2$. In the ideal packing model, these two ions are in contact. Therefore, the sum of their radii must equal this distance:\n$$r_B + r_O = \\frac{a}{2}$$\nThis equation gives a relationship for the lattice parameter based on the $\\mathrm{B}$-site and oxygen polyhedra:\n$$a = 2(r_B + r_O)$$\n\nNext, consider the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation, which occupies the corner of the unit cell, for example at $(0,0,0)$. This cation is coordinated by $12$ oxygen anions. An $\\mathrm{A}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bond lies along the face diagonal of the unit cell. The distance from a corner cation to an oxygen anion at a face center, such as $(a/2, a/2, 0)$, is given by the distance formula:\n$$d_{A-O} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{a}{2})^2 + (\\frac{a}{2})^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nFor ideal packing, the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation and the oxygen anion are also in contact along this direction. Thus, the sum of their radii must equal this distance:\n$$r_A + r_O = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThis yields a second relationship for the lattice parameter, based on the $\\mathrm{A}$-site environment:\n$$a = \\sqrt{2}(r_A + r_O)$$\n\nFor a perfect, strain-free ideal cubic perovskite structure, both geometric conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. By equating the two expressions for the lattice parameter $a$, we find the condition for ideal matching:\n$$2(r_B + r_O) = \\sqrt{2}(r_A + r_O)$$\nThe dimensionless tolerance factor $t$ is formulated to be equal to $1$ when this ideal condition is met. It is defined by rearranging the relationship between the two key bond lengths:\n$$t = \\frac{r_A + r_O}{\\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_O)}$$\nThis is the required dimensionless ratio that quantifies the size matching between the A-site and B-site frameworks.\n\nNow, we compute this value for $\\mathrm{Pb}(\\mathrm{Mg}_{1/3}\\mathrm{Nb}_{2/3})\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ (PMN) using the provided Shannon ionic radii. The B-site in PMN is disordered, containing both $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$ ions. We must first calculate the stoichiometrically averaged B-site radius, $r_B$, as specified.\nGiven: $r_A = r_{\\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}} = 1.49$ Å, $r_O = r_{\\mathrm{O}^{2-}} = 1.40$ Å, $r_{\\mathrm{Mg}} = r_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = 0.72$ Å, and $r_{\\mathrm{Nb}} = r_{\\mathrm{Nb}^{5+}} = 0.64$ Å.\n$$r_B = \\frac{1}{3}r_{\\mathrm{Mg}} + \\frac{2}{3}r_{\\mathrm{Nb}} = \\frac{1}{3}(0.72) + \\frac{2}{3}(0.64) = \\frac{0.72 + 1.28}{3} = \\frac{2.00}{3} \\text{ Å}$$\nNow, we substitute the radii values into the tolerance factor equation:\n$$t = \\frac{1.49 + 1.40}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{2.00}{3} + 1.40)} = \\frac{2.89}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{2.00}{3} + \\frac{1.40 \\times 3}{3})} = \\frac{2.89}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{2.00 + 4.20}{3})}$$\n$$t = \\frac{2.89}{\\sqrt{2}(\\frac{6.20}{3})} = \\frac{3 \\times 2.89}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 6.20} = \\frac{8.67}{8.7681...}$$\n$$t \\approx 0.988803$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $t = 0.9888$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. A tolerance factor $t < 1$ indicates that the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation is too small for the cuboctahedral cavity formed by the ideal framework of corner-sharing $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ octahedra. Alternatively, the $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ framework is too large for the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cation. To relieve the resulting tensile strain on the $\\mathrm{A}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bonds and compressive strain on the $\\mathrm{B}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bonds, the crystal structure must distort from the ideal cubic symmetry. A primary mechanism to accommodate this mismatch is the cooperative tilting or rotation of the $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ octahedra. This tilting reduces the volume of the $\\mathrm{A}$-site cavity, allowing for more stable $\\mathrm{A}$-$\\mathrm{O}$ bonding. Therefore, the calculated value of $t = 0.9888$, being less than unity, strongly suggests that the $\\mathrm{BO_6}$ framework in PMN is prone to octahedral tilting.\n\nThis structural propensity for tilting is a key factor supporting the local heterogeneity characteristic of relaxor ferroelectrics. Relaxor behavior is defined by the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs) within a globally non-polar matrix. In PMN, the random distribution of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Nb^{5+}}$ on the B-site creates significant chemical disorder and random local electric fields. The inherent instability of the ideal cubic lattice, evidenced by $t < 1$ and the resulting tendency for octahedral tilting, makes the structure highly susceptible to these local random fields. The lattice can easily adopt local, non-cubic distortions in response to the specific chemical environment. The tilting provides a \"soft\" structural degree of freedom that facilitates the formation of PNRs with local polar character, while the frustration induced by both chemical disorder and competing tilt systems prevents these regions from coalescing into a macroscopic ferroelectric domain. Thus, the calculated tolerance factor supports the view that PMN possesses an intrinsic structural instability that, when coupled with its inherent chemical disorder, gives rise to the complex local structure and characteristic properties of a relaxor ferroelectric.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9888}$$", "id": "2517556"}, {"introduction": "Domain engineering is a powerful strategy to unlock giant piezoelectric responses in relaxor ferroelectric single crystals.

Extract $u(E_a)$, $u(T_f)$, and $u(\\ln f_0)$, and then compute $f_0 = \\exp(\\ln f_0)$ and $u(f_0) \\approx f_0\\,u(\\ln f_0)$.\n- Output formatting: For each dataset, report $[E_a,\\ T_f,\\ f_0,\\ u(E_a),\\ u(T_f),\\ u(f_0)]$, rounding each to three significant figures, and aggregate the three dataset results into a single list printed on one line as specified.\n\n5. Notes on edge cases and physical realism\n\n- The constraint $T_f  \\min_i T_i$ enforces a separation between the freezing temperature and all measured $T_m$, guaranteeing finite denominators $T_i - T_f$.\n- The near-Arrhenius dataset has a small magnitude of $T_f$, so the fit should drive $T_f$ toward a small value relative to $T$, consistent with the Arrhenius limit $T_f \\to 0$.\n- The sparse dataset tests parameter identifiability with minimal data concentrated near $T_f$; the broad logarithmic dynamic range in $f$ helps maintain identifiability.\n- Using $\\ln f$ stabilizes the regression when $f$ spans many decades and appropriately matches the Gaussian error model supplied in $\\sigma_{\\ln f}$.\n\n6. Units and constants\n\nAll temperatures are in $\\mathrm{K}$, frequencies in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, and energies in $\\mathrm{eV}$. The Boltzmann constant is $k_B = 8.617333262145\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV/K}$, which ensures the ratio $E_a/(k_B\\,[T - T_f])$ is dimensionless.\n\nThe described procedure is implementable directly. The computational steps map cleanly onto widely available numerical libraries: construct the residuals and weights in the transformed space, fit with bounds and an analytic Jacobian, compute the covariance, propagate the uncertainty for $f_0$, and format the results as requested.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    # Physical constant: Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n    k_B = 8.617333262145e-5  # eV/K\n\n    # Define test datasets: (T_m [K], f [Hz], sigma_ln_f)\n    datasets = [\n        # Dataset A\n        {\n            \"Tm\": np.array([225.0, 235.0, 245.0, 260.0, 280.0], dtype=float),\n            \"f\":  np.array([1.0e1, 3.0e4, 2.0e6, 8.0e7, 5.0e8], dtype=float),\n            \"sigma_ln_f\": np.array([0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], dtype=float),\n        },\n        # Dataset B\n        {\n            \"Tm\": np.array([210.0, 240.0, 280.0, 320.0, 360.0], dtype=float),\n            \"f\":  np.array([3.2e9, 3.8e9, 4.3e9, 4.8e9, 5.2e9], dtype=float),\n            \"sigma_ln_f\": np.array([0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02], dtype=float),\n        },\n        # Dataset C\n        {\n            \"Tm\": np.array([270.0, 280.0, 290.0], dtype=float),\n            \"f\":  np.array([4.0e-3, 4.5e4, 1.0e7], dtype=float),\n            \"sigma_ln_f\": np.array([0.05, 0.05, 0.05], dtype=float),\n        },\n    ]\n\n    # Model: y = ln(f) = ln f0 - Ea / (k_B * (T - Tf))\n    def model_ln_f(T, Ea, Tf, ln_f0):\n        return ln_f0 - Ea / (k_B * (T - Tf))\n\n    # Analytic Jacobian wrt parameters [Ea, Tf, ln_f0]\n    def jacobian(T, Ea, Tf, ln_f0):\n        u = (T - Tf)\n        # Ensure numerical safety; though bounds should prevent zero/negative u\n        d_dEa = -1.0 / (k_B * u)\n        d_dTf = -Ea / (k_B * (u**2))\n        d_dlnf0 = np.ones_like(T)\n        # Stack columns\n        J = np.vstack((d_dEa, d_dTf, d_dlnf0)).T\n        return J\n\n    results = []\n\n    for data in datasets:\n        T = data[\"Tm\"]\n        f = data[\"f\"]\n        sigma_y = data[\"sigma_ln_f\"].astype(float)\n        y = np.log(f)\n\n        # Initial guesses\n        Ea0 = 0.02  # eV\n        Tf0 = float(np.min(T) - 5.0)  # K, ensure below min(T)\n        ln_f0_0 = np.log(1.0e11)  # attempt frequency guess\n\n        p0 = np.array([Ea0, Tf0, ln_f0_0], dtype=float)\n\n        # Bounds to ensure physical plausibility and numerical stability\n        lower_bounds = np.array([1.0e-5, -200.0, np.log(1.0e8)], dtype=float)\n        upper_bounds = np.array([1.0, np.min(T) - 0.1, np.log(1.0e15)], dtype=float)\n\n        # Perform weighted nonlinear least squares on ln f\n        popt, pcov = curve_fit(\n            f=model_ln_f,\n            xdata=T,\n            ydata=y,\n            p0=p0,\n            sigma=sigma_y,\n            absolute_sigma=True,\n            bounds=(lower_bounds, upper_bounds),\n            jac=jacobian,\n            method=\"trf\",\n            max_nfev=20000,\n        )\n\n        Ea_hat, Tf_hat, ln_f0_hat = popt\n        # Uncertainties (standard deviations) from covariance\n        perr = np.sqrt(np.diag(pcov))\n        u_Ea, u_Tf, u_ln_f0 = perr\n\n        # Transform ln f0 to f0 and propagate uncertainty\n        f0_hat = float(np.exp(ln_f0_hat))\n        u_f0 = float(f0_hat * u_ln_f0)\n\n        results.append((Ea_hat, Tf_hat, f0_hat, u_Ea, u_Tf, u_f0))\n\n    # Format to three significant figures\n    def fmt_sig(x, sig=3):\n        # Use general format with specified significant digits\n        return f\"{x:.{sig}g}\"\n\n    # Build output string as a single line\n    out_lists = []\n    for r in results:\n        Ea_hat, Tf_hat, f0_hat, u_Ea, u_Tf, u_f0 = r\n        inner = [\n            fmt_sig(Ea_hat), fmt_sig(Tf_hat), fmt_sig(f0_hat),\n            fmt_sig(u_Ea), fmt_sig(u_Tf), fmt_sig(u_f0)\n        ]\n        out_lists.append(\"[\" + \",\".join(inner) + \"]\")\n    print(\"[\" + \",\".join(out_lists) + \"]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2517484"}]}
