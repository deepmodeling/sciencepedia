No flaws that would invalidate the problem have been identified. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis starting from fundamental definitions in semiconductor physics.\n\n1) First, we derive the general expression for the Hall mobility $\\mu_H(T)$ for a single-band conductor. The electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$, is given by the Drude form:\n$$ \\sigma = n |q| \\mu $$\nFor an n-type semiconductor, the charge carriers are electrons, so the charge is $q = -e$, and its magnitude is $|q| = e$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\sigma = n e \\mu $$\nwhere $n$ is the electron concentration and $\\mu$ is the drift mobility.\nThe Hall coefficient, $R_H$, in the weak-field limit for an n-type conductor is given by:\n$$ R_H = -\\frac{r_H}{ne} $$\nwhere $r_H$ is the Hall scattering factor, which accounts for the energy distribution of charge carriers and the energy dependence of the scattering mechanism.\nThe Hall mobility, $\\mu_H$, is defined by convention as the product of the magnitude of the Hall coefficient and the electrical conductivity. This definition provides a direct measure of mobility from experimental Hall and resistivity data.\n$$ \\mu_H(T) \\equiv |R_H(T)| \\sigma(T) $$\nThis is the general relation sought.\n\n2) Second, we explain the role of the Hall factor $r_H$. By substituting the expressions for $\\sigma$ and $R_H$ into the definition of $\\mu_H$, we can relate the Hall mobility to the drift mobility:\n$$ \\mu_H = |R_H| \\sigma = \\left|-\\frac{r_H}{ne}\\right| (ne\\mu) = \\frac{r_H}{ne} (ne\\mu) = r_H \\mu $$\nThis shows that $\\mu_H = r_H \\mu$. The drift mobility $\\mu$, which represents the average carrier drift velocity per unit electric field and enters the expression for $\\sigma$, is therefore obtained from the measured Hall mobility by correcting for the Hall factor:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{\\mu_H}{r_H} $$\nThe Hall factor $r_H$ is not unity because carriers in a semiconductor have a distribution of energies, and the scattering time $\\tau$ is generally energy-dependent, i.e., $\\tau = \\tau(E)$. The Hall factor is formally defined as the ratio of averages of the scattering time over the carrier distribution, $r_H = \\frac{\\langle \\tau^2 \\rangle}{\\langle \\tau \\rangle^2}$. For a parabolic band and non-degenerate statistics, with a power-law dependence of the scattering time on energy, $\\tau(E) \\propto E^r$, the value of $r_H$ is determined by the exponent $r$, which is characteristic of the dominant scattering mechanism.\nTo correct $\\mu_H$ for the two specified cases, we apply the relation $\\mu = \\mu_H / r_H$:\n(i) For acoustic phonon scattering, with the given $r_H = 1.18$, the drift mobility is $\\mu = \\mu_H / 1.18$.\n(ii) For ionized impurity scattering, with the given $r_H = 1.93$, the drift mobility is $\\mu = \\mu_H / 1.93$.\n\n3) Third, we perform the numerical evaluation at $T = 800\\,\\text{K}$. At this temperature, the given functions for $\\sigma(T)$ and $R_H(T)$ evaluate to:\n$$ \\sigma(800\\,\\text{K}) = 1.20 \\times 10^5 \\left(\\frac{800\\,\\text{K}}{800\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{-0.50} = 1.20 \\times 10^5 \\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\n$$ R_H(800\\,\\text{K}) = -3.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\left(\\frac{800\\,\\text{K}}{800\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{0.10} = -3.00 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{C}^{-1} $$\nUsing these values, we calculate the Hall mobility $\\mu_H$ at $T=800\\,\\text{K}$:\n$$ \\mu_H = |R_H(800\\,\\text{K})| \\sigma(800\\,\\text{K}) = |-3.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{C}^{-1}| \\times (1.20 \\times 10^5 \\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\mu_H = 3.60 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNow, for the case of acoustic phonon scattering where $r_H=1.18$, we compute the drift mobility $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{\\mu_H}{r_H} = \\frac{3.60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1.18} \\approx 3.050847 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe question requires the final answer in units of $\\text{cm}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$. Using the conversion $1\\,\\text{m}^2 = 10^4\\,\\text{cm}^2$:\n$$ \\mu \\approx (3.050847 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 10^4 \\,\\text{cm}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\approx 30.50847 \\,\\text{cm}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ \\mu \\approx 30.5 \\,\\text{cm}^2\\,\\text{V}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\n4) Finally, we briefly discuss the importance of $r_H$. Applying the correct Hall factor $r_H$ is critical because it allows for the accurate separation of the macroscopic electrical conductivity $\\sigma = ne\\mu$ into its constituent microscopic transport parameters: the carrier concentration $n=r_H/(e|R_H|)$ and the drift mobility $\\mu=\\mu_H/r_H$. This correct decomposition is fundamental for a physically sound interpretation of transport data and for strategically engineering the material's power factor $S^2\\sigma$ and electronic thermal conductivity $k_e$ to maximize the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{30.5}\n$$", "id": "2532553"}]}
