It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics, specifically the theory of polarons, and is well-posed, providing sufficient information to determine the requested quantities based on a standard physical model.\n\nThe problem requires an estimation of the polaron binding energy, $E_{p}$, from the peak energy of a mid-infrared (MIR) absorption band in a transition-metal oxide. The system is described within the Holstein model, which assumes a local, or short-range, coupling between an electron and a single dispersionless optical phonon mode of energy $\\hbar\\omega_{0}$. The MIR absorption is attributed to phonon-assisted hopping of these charge carriers.\n\nThe physical process is governed by the Franck-Condon principle, which states that an electronic transition (such as the electron hopping from one lattice site to another) occurs on a much faster timescale than the nuclear motion (lattice vibrations). Consequently, the optical absorption corresponds to a \"vertical\" transition on a configuration coordinate diagram.\n\nLet us define the system's energy in terms of a generalized coordinate $Q$ that represents the local lattice distortion. In the initial state, an electron is self-trapped at a particular site, let us call it site $1$. This self-trapping occurs because the electron polarizes the surrounding lattice, creating a potential well for itself. The lattice relaxes to an equilibrium distortion $Q_{1}$, and the energy of the system is lowered by the polaron binding energy, $E_{p}$. We can set the energy of this initial ground state as $E_{initial} = -E_{p}$, relative to an electron in an undistorted lattice.\n\nThe absorption of a photon with energy $\\hbar\\Omega$ promotes the electron to an adjacent site, say site $2$. According to the Franck-Condon principle, this transition happens instantaneously, so the lattice coordinates do not change during the absorption event. The system is now in an excited state where the electron is at site $2$, but the lattice is still distorted as if the electron were at site $1$ (i.e., the configuration coordinate is still $Q_{1}$). This is a non-equilibrium, high-energy state.\n\nThe energy of this final, unrelaxed state can be determined as follows. The lattice distortion at site $1$ required an energy input of $E_{p}$ to be created (this energy was over-compensated by the electron-lattice interaction when the electron was present, leading to the net binding energy). Now that the electron has departed from site $1$, this distortion energy, $E_{p}$, remains as a positive contribution to the system's total energy. The electron, now at site $2$, does not benefit from any favorable lattice distortion, as the lattice around site $2$ is still in its undistorted equilibrium position. Therefore, the energy of this Franck-Condon final state is $E_{final, unrelaxed} = +E_{p}$.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final unrelaxed state and the initial ground state:\n$$ \\hbar\\Omega_{\\text{max}} = E_{final, unrelaxed} - E_{initial} $$\n$$ \\hbar\\Omega_{\\text{max}} = (+E_{p}) - (-E_{p}) = 2E_{p} $$\nThis result, where the optical absorption peak energy for small-polaron hopping is twice the polaron binding energy, is a fundamental conclusion of the Holstein-polaron theory in the strong-coupling, non-adiabatic limit.\n\nThe problem provides the energy of the MIR conductivity maximum as $\\hbar\\Omega_{\\text{max}} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Using the derived relation, we can estimate the polaron binding energy $E_{p}$:\n$$ E_{p} = \\frac{\\hbar\\Omega_{\\text{max}}}{2} $$\n$$ E_{p} = \\frac{0.50 \\ \\mathrm{eV}}{2} = 0.25 \\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we have $E_{p} = 0.250 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe second part of the question asks to classify the carriers as small polarons or not. The distinction between a small polaron (localized on a single site) and a large polaron (spread over many lattice sites) is determined by the strength of the electron-phonon coupling. In the Holstein model, this is quantified by the dimensionless Huang-Rhys factor, $S$, which is the ratio of the polaron binding energy to the characteristic phonon energy:\n$$ S = \\frac{E_{p}}{\\hbar\\omega_{0}} $$\nSmall polarons form in the strong-coupling regime, which is mathematically defined by the condition $S > 1$. Large polarons form in the weak-coupling regime, $S < 1$.\n\nUsing our calculated value for $E_{p}$ and the given phonon energy $\\hbar\\omega_{0} = 0.070 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$ S = \\frac{0.250 \\ \\mathrm{eV}}{0.070 \\ \\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 3.57 $$\nSince $S \\approx 3.57 > 1$, the system is in the strong-coupling regime. This strongly supports the conclusion that the charge carriers are indeed small polarons.\n\nFurthermore, the qualitative observation of a \"broad mid-infrared (MIR) band\" is the quintessential optical signature of small-polaron hopping. Band-like transport by nearly free carriers or large polarons would manifest as a Drude peak in conductivity centered at zero frequency. The presence of a prominent absorption peak at a finite, high energy ($\\hbar\\Omega_{\\text{max}} = 2E_p$) is direct evidence for carrier localization and a hopping-based transport mechanism, which are the defining characteristics of the small polaron. The width of this band is also a function of the coupling strength and temperature, and a large $E_{p}$ naturally leads to a broad band, consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, both the quantitative ratio $E_{p}/(\\hbar\\omega_{0})$ and the qualitative features of the optical spectrum confirm the small-polaron nature of the carriers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.250}$$", "id": "2512449"}]}
