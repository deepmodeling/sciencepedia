It is based on the fundamental principles of materials chemistry, specifically the stoichiometry and charge balance in aluminosilicate zeolites. All necessary data are provided, and the problem structure leads to a unique, verifiable solution. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the number of charge-compensating protons per unit cell of a proton-form MFI zeolite, and the corresponding Brønsted acid site density. We are given that the silicon-to-aluminum ratio, $\\mathrm{Si/Al}$, is $15$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the chemical composition of the unit cell. The problem provides the general formula for the proton-form aluminosilicate unit cell as $\\mathrm{H}_{x}\\mathrm{Al}_{x}\\mathrm{Si}_{96-x}\\mathrm{O}_{192}$. Here, $x$ represents the number of aluminum atoms that have isomorphously substituted silicon atoms in the framework's $96$ tetrahedral sites (T-sites).\n\nThe number of silicon atoms per unit cell, $N_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, is given by $96-x$.\nThe number of aluminum atoms per unit cell, $N_{\\mathrm{Al}}$, is given by $x$.\n\nThe silicon-to-aluminum ratio is defined as the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Si}}{\\mathrm{Al}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{N_{\\mathrm{Al}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $x$ and the given value of the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{96-x}{x} = 15 $$\nTo find $x$, we solve this linear equation:\n$$ 96 - x = 15x $$\n$$ 96 = 16x $$\n$$ x = \\frac{96}{16} = 6 $$\nThus, there are $x=6$ aluminum atoms per unit cell.\n\nIn an aluminosilicate framework, the substitution of a tetravalent silicon cation, $\\mathrm{Si}^{4+}$, by a trivalent aluminum cation, $\\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$, creates a local charge deficit of $-1$ on the framework. To maintain overall charge neutrality, this negative charge must be compensated by a cation. The problem states the zeolite is in its proton form, meaning each negative charge is compensated by a proton, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Therefore, the number of required protons per unit cell is equal to the number of aluminum atoms, $x$.\n$$ \\text{Number of protons per unit cell} = x = 6 $$\n\nThe first part of the problem is solved. The chemical formula for the unit cell is thus $\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Al}_{6}\\mathrm{Si}_{90}\\mathrm{O}_{192}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Brønsted acid site density. Each charge-compensating proton bonded to a framework oxygen atom constitutes a Brønsted acid site. Therefore, there are $x=6$ Brønsted acid sites per unit cell. The acid site density is the number of moles of acid sites per unit mass of the material. To calculate this, we first need the molar mass of the unit cell, $M_{\\mathrm{UC}}$.\n\nThe molar mass is calculated using the unit cell formula $\\mathrm{H}_{6}\\mathrm{Al}_{6}\\mathrm{Si}_{90}\\mathrm{O}_{192}$ and the provided atomic masses: $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.00784 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ mol^{-1}}$, $M_{\\mathrm{Al}} = 26.9815385 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ mol^{-1}}$, $M_{\\mathrm{Si}} = 28.0855 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ mol^{-1}}$, and $M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\nThe molar mass of the unit cell, $M_{\\mathrm{UC}}$, is the sum of the masses of its constituent atoms:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{UC}} = 6 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{H}} + 6 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{Al}} + 90 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{Si}} + 192 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{O}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{UC}} = 6 \\times (1.00784) + 6 \\times (26.9815385) + 90 \\times (28.0855) + 192 \\times (15.999) $$\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{UC}} = 6.04704 + 161.889231 + 2527.695 + 3071.808 $$\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{UC}} = 5767.439271 \\ \\mathrm{g \\ mol^{-1}} $$\n\nThe Brønsted acid site density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, is the number of moles of acid sites per gram of zeolite.

For a generic species $I$, the adsorption equilibrium $I(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons I*$ is characterized by an equilibrium constant $K_I$. From the law of mass action, the relationship between the surface coverage of the adsorbed species, $\\theta_I$, the fraction of vacant sites, $\\theta_*$, and the gas-phase partial pressure, $p_I$, is given by:\n$$ \\theta_I = K_I p_I \\theta_* $$\nThis relationship applies to isobutane ($A$), propane ($P$), and methane ($M$):\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_* $$\n$$ \\theta_P = K_P p_P \\theta_* $$\n$$ \\theta_M = K_M p_M \\theta_* $$\n\nThe total number of catalytic sites is constant. According to the single-site Langmuir model, the sum of the fractional coverages of all surface species (adsorbed molecules and vacant sites) must be equal to unity.

The turnover frequency, $\\text{TOF}$, is defined as the number of reacting molecules per site per unit time. For a unimolecular reaction, this is directly proportional to the surface coverage of the reactant, $\\theta_A$, with the proportionality constant being the surface reaction rate constant, $k$:\n$$ \\text{TOF} = k \\cdot \\theta_A $$\n\nTo obtain the final rate law as a function of measurable gas-phase pressures, we first express $\\theta_A$ in terms of these pressures.

This is obtained by multiplying the site-based turnover frequency by the total number of active sites per unit mass of catalyst, i.e., the site density $N_s$:\n$$ r = N_s \\times \\text{TOF} $$\nThus, the final expression for the catalytic rate is:\n$$ r = N_s \\cdot k \\cdot \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_P p_P + K_M p_M} $$\n\nThis is a classic Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) rate expression. The denominator, $1 + K_A p_A + K_P p_P + K_M p_M$, is the inhibition term, which accounts for the competition for active sites among the reactant and products.\n\nWe now apply this derived expression to calculate the rate $r$ for each of the five specified test cases. The parameters for each case are:\n- Case A: $p_A = 0.20$, $p_P = 0.00$, $p_M = 0.00$, $K_A = 2.50$, $K_P = 1.20$, $K_M = 0.05$, $k = 0.80$, $N_s = 0.60$.\n- Case B: $p_A = 0.20$, $p_P = 0.50$, $p_M = 0.50$, $K_A = 2.50$, $K_P = 1.20$, $K_M = 0.05$, $k = 0.80$, $N_s = 0.60$.\n- Case C: $p_A = 5.00$, $p_P = 0.00$, $p_M = 0.00$, $K_A = 2.50$, $K_P = 1.20$, $K_M = 0.05$, $k = 0.80$, $N_s = 0.60$.\n- Case D: $p_A = 0.10$, $p_P = 0.80$, $p_M = 1.00$, $K_A = 3.00$, $K_P = 0.00$, $K_M = 0.00$, $k = 1.20$, $N_s = 1.00$.\n- Case E: $p_A = 0.00$, $p_P = 0.50$, $p_M = 0.50$, $K_A = 2.50$, $K_P = 1.20$, $K_M = 0.05$, $k = 0.80$, $N_s = 0.60$.\n\nThe calculations are performed by substituting these values into the final rate expression for $r$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the catalytic rate based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood microkinetic model\n    for protolytic cracking of isobutane.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_rate(p_A, p_P, p_M, K_A, K_P, K_M, k, N_s):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the catalytic rate r using the derived LHHW expression.\n\n        The rate expression is:\n        r = N_s * k * (K_A * p_A) / (1 + K_A * p_A + K_P * p_P + K_M * p_M)\n\n        Args:\n            p_A (float): Partial pressure of isobutane (A) in bar.\n            p_P (float): Partial pressure of propane (P) in bar.\n            p_M (float): Partial pressure of methane (M) in bar.\n            K_A (float): Adsorption equilibrium constant for A in bar^-1.\n            K_P (float): Adsorption equilibrium constant for P in bar^-1.\n            K_M (float): Adsorption equilibrium constant for M in bar^-1.\n            k (float): Unimolecular surface reaction rate constant in s^-1.\n            N_s (float): Brønsted site density in mol/kg_cat.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The catalytic rate r in mol/(kg_cat * s).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Numerator term related to reactant coverage\n        numerator_term = K_A * p_A\n\n        # Denominator is the inhibition term\n        denominator = 1 + (K_A * p_A) + (K_P * p_P) + (K_M * p_M)\n\n        # Handle the case where the denominator might be zero, although physically unlikely\n        # with the given model (since it starts with 1).
