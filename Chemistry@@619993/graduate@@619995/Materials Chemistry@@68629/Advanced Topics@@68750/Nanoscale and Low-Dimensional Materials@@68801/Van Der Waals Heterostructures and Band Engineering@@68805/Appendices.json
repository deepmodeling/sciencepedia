Consider a sample with a hexagonal moiré lattice arising from two graphene layers twisted by an angle $\\theta$. The primitive moiré lattice vectors have equal length $L_{m}$ and enclose an angle of $60^{\\circ}$, so the moiré unit cell area is $A_{m} = (\\sqrt{3}/2)L_{m}^{2}$. The moiré period at small twist angle is given by the well-tested relation $L_{m} = a/[2\\sin(\\theta/2)]$, where $a$ is the graphene lattice constant.

It describes a standard scenario in the physics of moiré materials. All necessary data are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation based on fundamental principles of solid-state physics. We begin with Bloch's theorem and the quantization of electron states in a crystal of finite size.\n\nConsider a two-dimensional crystal sample of area $S$. For a large sample, we can apply Born-von Karman (periodic) boundary conditions. This quantizes the allowed electron wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$. The allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-points form a uniform grid in reciprocal space. The \"area\" occupied by a single $\\mathbf{k}$-state in this space is given by $\\Delta A_k = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{S}$.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice of a periodic crystal defines a Brillouin zone (BZ). For a two-dimensional crystal with a real-space unit cell of area $A_{\\text{cell}}$, the area of the first Brillouin zone is $A_{\\text{BZ}} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{A_{\\text{cell}}}$.\n\nThe total number of unique $\\mathbf{k}$-states within the first Brillouin zone is the ratio of the BZ area to the area per state. This number corresponds to the total number of single-particle orbital states in a single electronic band.\n$$\nN_{\\text{states}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{BZ}}}{\\Delta A_k} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2/A_{\\text{cell}}}{(2\\pi)^2/S} = \\frac{S}{A_{\\text{cell}}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the number of states in one band is equal to the number of unit cells in the sample, $N_{\\text{cell}} = S/A_{\\text{cell}}$.\n\nFor the twisted bilayer graphene system, the periodic potential is not that of the individual graphene layers but of the moiré superlattice. The relevant unit cell is the moiré unit cell of area $A_m$, and the electronic bands are the moiré minibands. Applying the general principle derived above, the number of orbital states in a single, isolated moiré miniband (per spin, per valley) for a sample of area $S$ is equal to the number of moiré unit cells, $N_m$.\n$$\nN_m = \\frac{S}{A_m}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the carrier density $n_{\\text{fill}}$ required to completely fill one such miniband, accounting for all degeneracies. In twisted bilayer graphene, the low-energy physics near the charge neutrality point is characterized by a set of nearly flat minibands. These bands possess both spin degeneracy ($g_s = 2$) and valley degeneracy ($g_v = 2$, from the K and K' valleys of the original graphene Brillouin zones). Thus, there is a total of $g_s g_v = 2 \\times 2 = 4$ such minibands. The term \"completely fill\" in this context refers to filling this entire quadruplet of bands, which corresponds to adding $4$ electrons per moiré unit cell and leads to an insulating state.\n\nThe total number of electrons, $N_{\\text{total}}$, required to fill these $4$ bands is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = g_s g_v N_m = 4 \\times \\frac{S}{A_m}\n$$\nThe carrier density $n_{\\text{fill}}$ is the total number of added carriers per unit area of the sample:\n$$\nn_{\\text{fill}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{total}}}{S} = \\frac{4S/A_m}{S} = \\frac{4}{A_m}\n$$\nNow, we must find an expression for $A_m$. The problem provides the moiré unit cell area for a hexagonal lattice as $A_m = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} L_m^2$, where $L_m$ is the moiré lattice period. The period is given by $L_m = \\frac{a}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)}$, where $a$ is the graphene lattice constant and $\\theta$ is the twist angle.\nSubstituting the expression for $L_m$ into the one for $A_m$:\n$$\nA_m = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\left( \\frac{a}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} a^2}{8\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $n_{\\text{fill}}$:\n$$\nn_{\\text{fill}} = \\frac{4}{A_m} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} a^2}{8\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}} = \\frac{32\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{\\sqrt{3} a^2}\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically.

The variational wavefunction $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = A \\exp(-\\alpha r_1 - \\alpha r_2)$ can be expressed as a product of two normalized 2D orbitals $\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha^2}{\\pi}}\\exp(-\\alpha r)$, such that the normalized three-body wavefunction is $\\Psi_{\\text{norm}}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r}_1) \\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r}_2)$.

Trion Binding Energy $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}}$**\n\nThe trion binding energy is the energy required to dissociate a trion into its lowest-energy unbound state, which is an exciton and a free electron. It is defined as $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} = (E_{\\mathrm{X}}^{\\mathrm{var}} + E_{\\text{electron}}) - E_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}}$. Setting the energy of the free electron at the band edge to zero, we have $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} = E_{\\mathrm{X}}^{\\mathrm{var}} - E_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu e^4}{8\\pi^2\\hbar^2\\varepsilon_0^2\\kappa^2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\mu}{4\\hbar^2} \\left(\\frac{32-3\\pi}{32\\pi}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0\\kappa}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{32-3\\pi}{32\\pi}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} \\right] \\frac{\\mu e^4}{\\hbar^2\\varepsilon_0^2\\kappa^2}\n$$\nTo simplify the prefactor, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\frac{(32-3\\pi)^2}{(32\\pi)^2} - \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} = \\frac{(32-3\\pi)^2}{4096\\pi^2} - \\frac{512}{4096\\pi^2} = \\frac{(32-3\\pi)^2 - 512}{4096\\pi^2}\n$$\nExpanding the numerator: $(32-3\\pi)^2 - 512 = (1024 - 192\\pi + 9\\pi^2) - 512 = 512 - 192\\pi + 9\\pi^2$.\nThus, the trion binding energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} = \\frac{512 - 192\\pi + 9\\pi^2}{4096\\pi^2} \\frac{\\mu e^4}{\\hbar^2\\varepsilon_0^2\\kappa^2}\n$$\n\n**Qualitative Discussion**\n\nThe expression for the trion binding energy is $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} = C \\frac{\\mu e^4}{\\hbar^2\\varepsilon_0^2\\kappa^2}$, where $C$ is a dimensionless constant.\n- **Scaling with $\\kappa$ and $\\mu$**: The binding energy scales as $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}} \\propto \\mu / \\kappa^2$.\n    - The direct proportionality to the reduced mass $\\mu$ is because the kinetic energy, which opposes localization and binding, is inversely proportional to mass ($\\langle T \\rangle \\propto 1/\\mu$). Heavier particles have smaller kinetic energy for a given level of confinement, leading to a more strongly bound state.\n    - The inverse square dependence on the dielectric constant $\\kappa$ arises because all Coulomb interactions are screened by $\\kappa$. The characteristic energy of a 2D system with a $1/r$ potential scales as the square of the interaction strength, which is proportional to $1/\\kappa$. Thus, the energy scales as $1/\\kappa^2$. Stronger dielectric screening (larger $\\kappa$) weakens both attraction and repulsion, leading to a rapid decrease in the binding energy of both excitons and trions.\n\n- **Role of Realistic Screening**: The model uses a simple static dielectric constant $\\kappa$, implying a $1/r$ potential. In realistic van der Waals heterostructures, screening is non-local and distance-dependent. The interaction is only weakly screened at short distances (behaving like $\\ln r$) and approaches the $1/r$ form at long distances. This means the simple $1/\\kappa$ model overestimates the screening effect at the short ranges relevant for bound states. A more realistic potential, such as the Rytova-Keldysh potential, would lead to stronger effective interactions, which would increase both the exciton and trion energies. This enhancement is typically more pronounced for the more compact trion state, resulting in a **larger** trion binding energy estimate.\n\n- **Role of Electron-Electron Correlation**: The variational ansatz $\\Psi \\propto \\exp(-\\alpha r_1 - \\alpha r_2)$ does not include any explicit dependence on the inter-electron distance $r_{12}$. This neglects electron correlation, which is the tendency of electrons to avoid each other due to their mutual repulsion. A more sophisticated wavefunction, such as one including a Jastrow factor like $(1+f(r_{12}))$, would allow the electrons to stay further apart, thus lowering the expectation value of the repulsive potential energy $\\langle V_{ee} \\rangle$. According to the variational principle, any improvement to the trial wavefunction must lower the total energy estimate $E_{\\mathrm{T}}$. Since the exciton energy $E_{\\mathrm{X}}$ is unaffected by this change, a lower $E_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{var}}$ leads to a **larger** binding energy $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{T}} = E_{\\mathrm{X}} - E_{\\mathrm{T}}$.\nNotably, the numerical prefactor in our derived expression, $512 - 192\\pi + 9\\pi^2 \\approx -2.36$, is negative. This implies that within this simple one-parameter variational model, the trion is unstable against dissociation into an exciton and a free electron. This is a famous result, analogous to the failure of the simplest trial function to predict the binding of the negative hydrogen ion ($H^-$) in 3D. It underscores that electron-electron correlation is not merely a small correction but is qualitatively essential for stabilizing the trion state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{512 - 192\\pi + 9\\pi^2}{4096\\pi^2}\\frac{\\mu e^4}{\\hbar^2\\varepsilon_0^2\\kappa^2}}\n$$", "id": "2535527"}]}
