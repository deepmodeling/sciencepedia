The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution shall be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in four parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the interaction energy per unit area, $U(z)$.\n\nWe begin with the provided integral for the interaction energy per unit area, $U(z)$, between two continuous sheets:\n$$\nU(z) = n^{2}\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} v\\!\\left(\\sqrt{\\rho^{2}+z^{2}}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}\\boldsymbol{\\rho}\n$$\nThe pair potential $v(r)$ is the Lennard-Jones $12$–$6$ potential:\n$$\nv(r) = 4\\,\\varepsilon \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting $r=\\sqrt{\\rho^2+z^2}$ and the expression for $v(r)$ into the integral for $U(z)$:\n$$\nU(z) = n^2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} 4\\varepsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\rho^2+z^2}}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\rho^2+z^2}}\\right)^{6} \\right] \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{\\rho}\n$$\n$$\nU(z) = 4\\varepsilon n^2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{(\\rho^2+z^2)^6} - \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{(\\rho^2+z^2)^3} \\right] \\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{\\rho}\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral over the two-dimensional plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, it is most convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let the in-plane separation vector be $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$, with magnitude $\\rho = |\\boldsymbol{\\rho}|$. The differential area element is $\\mathrm{d}^2\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}\\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$, where $\\rho$ ranges from $0$ to $\\infty$ and the angle $\\phi$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$.

We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for the in-plane elastic constants $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{66}$ of a hexagonal two-dimensional material from the strain energy density $U$ under specific deformation paths. The foundation of this analysis is the provided expression for strain energy density in Voigt notation for a $2$D system with hexagonal symmetry, for which $C_{11}=C_{22}$:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( C_{11} \\varepsilon_{xx}^{2} + C_{11} \\varepsilon_{yy}^{2} + 2 C_{12} \\varepsilon_{xx} \\varepsilon_{yy} + C_{66} \\gamma_{xy}^{2} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ and $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ are normal strains, and $\\gamma_{xy}$ is the engineering shear strain. The elastic constants are fundamentally related to the curvature of the energy-strain landscape at the equilibrium point (zero strain). Specifically, they are the second derivatives of the strain energy density with respect to the strain components. Our task is to find these constants by analyzing the energy response along three prescribed deformation paths.\n\nLet us analyze each deformation path methodically.\n\nFirst, consider the uniaxial deformation along the $x$-axis. The strain components are given by $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = 0$, and $\\gamma_{xy} = 0$. Substituting these into the general expression for $U$ yields the energy density for this path, $U_{\\text{uni}}(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\nU_{\\text{uni}}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( C_{11} \\epsilon^2 + C_{11}(0)^2 + 2C_{12}\\epsilon(0) + C_{66}(0)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} C_{11} \\epsilon^2\n$$\nIn the framework of linear elasticity, the elastic constant $C_{11}$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term. More formally, we can extract it by taking the second derivative of $U_{\\text{uni}}$ with respect to the strain parameter $\\epsilon$ and evaluating it at zero strain:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{uni}}}{d\\epsilon^2} = \\frac{d^2}{d\\epsilon^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} C_{11} \\epsilon^2 \\right) = C_{11}\n$$\nThus, we establish our first relation:\n$$\nC_{11} = \\left. \\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{uni}}}{d\\epsilon^2} \\right|_{\\epsilon=0}\n$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the equi-biaxial deformation. The strain state is defined by $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon$, and $\\gamma_{xy} = 0$. The strain energy density, $U_{\\text{bi}}(\\epsilon)$, becomes:\n$$\nU_{\\text{bi}}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( C_{11} \\epsilon^2 + C_{11}\\epsilon^2 + 2C_{12}\\epsilon \\cdot \\epsilon + C_{66}(0)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (2C_{11} + 2C_{12}) \\epsilon^2 = (C_{11} + C_{12}) \\epsilon^2\n$$\nAgain, we take the second derivative with respect to $\\epsilon$ to find the curvature at $\\epsilon=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{bi}}}{d\\epsilon^2} = \\frac{d^2}{d\\epsilon^2} \\left( (C_{11} + C_{12}) \\epsilon^2 \\right) = 2(C_{11} + C_{12})\n$$\nThis gives us a relationship for the sum of $C_{11}$ and $C_{12}$:\n$$\n2(C_{11} + C_{12}) = \\left. \\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{bi}}}{d\\epsilon^2} \\right|_{\\epsilon=0}\n$$\nHaving already determined $C_{11}$ from the uniaxial test, we can now isolate $C_{12}$:\n$$\nC_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left. \\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{bi}}}{d\\epsilon^2} \\right|_{\\epsilon=0} - C_{11}\n$$\n\nThird, for the pure in-plane shear deformation, the strain state is $\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = 0$, and $\\gamma_{xy} = \\gamma$. The energy density, $U_{\\text{shear}}(\\gamma)$, is:\n$$\nU_{\\text{shear}}(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( C_{11}(0)^2 + C_{11}(0)^2 + 2C_{12}(0)(0) + C_{66}\\gamma^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} C_{66} \\gamma^2\n$$\nThe second derivative with respect to the shear strain amplitude $\\gamma$ at $\\gamma = 0$ provides the shear elastic constant $C_{66}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{shear}}}{d\\gamma^2} = \\frac{d^2}{d\\gamma^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} C_{66} \\gamma^2 \\right) = C_{66}\n$$\nThis yields our third and final relation:\n$$\nC_{66} = \\left. \\frac{d^2 U_{\\text{shear}}}{d\\gamma^2} \\right|_{\\gamma=0}\n$$\n\nTo implement this computationally, we are given synthetic data which includes a small quartic term to simulate anharmonic effects present in real materials. For a generic deformation path parameterized by a strain $x$, the energy is $U(x) = a x^2 + b x^4$. A general polynomial fit of degree $N \\geq 4$, $P(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i x^i$, will be used to model the discrete energy data points. The second derivative of this polynomial is $P''(x) = \\sum_{i=2}^{N} i(i-1) a_i x^{i-2}$. At zero strain ($x=0$), this simplifies to $P''(0) = 2a_2$, where $a_2$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term.\n\nThe numerical procedure is therefore as follows:\n$1$. For each of the three deformation types (uniaxial, biaxial, shear), generate a set of data points $(x_i, U_i)$ using the provided strain grid and energy functions.\n$2$. For each set of data, perform a polynomial fit of degree $4$ to obtain the coefficients $a_i$. The provided energy functions are even, $U(x) = U(-x)$, so the coefficients of odd powers ($a_1, a_3$) will be zero within numerical precision. The fitting polynomial is effectively $P(x) = a_0 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x^4$.\n$3$. From the polynomial fit, extract the coefficient of the quadratic term, $a_2$. The second derivative of the energy with respect to strain at zero strain is then computed as $2a_2$.

Consider a Raman-active in-plane optical phonon mode (the $E'$ mode in the hexagonal monolayer) whose unstrained wavenumber (proportional to angular frequency) is $\\omega_{0} = 385.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The sample is subjected to a small, uniform, equibiaxial in-plane tensile engineering strain $\\varepsilon_{b}$, while the substrate constrains the out-of-plane thickness so that its change is negligible over the applied strain range. The experimentally measured dependence of the Raman wavenumber on strain near zero strain is linear, with slope $\\left.\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{b}=0} = -560.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ when $\\varepsilon_{b}$ is expressed as a dimensionless engineering strain.\n\nStarting only from the following foundational elements:\n- The definition of the mode-specific Grüneisen parameter $\\gamma_{i}$ as $\\gamma_{i} \\equiv -\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\omega_{i}}{\\partial \\ln V}$, where $\\omega_{i}$ is the mode frequency and $V$ is the crystal volume.\n- Small-strain kinematics, for which the volumetric (relative) change is $d\\ln V = \\mathrm{tr}\\left(d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\right)$, with $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ the infinitesimal strain tensor.\n- The geometric fact that, for equibiaxial in-plane strain with negligible thickness change, the area change satisfies $d\\ln A = d\\ln V$ and, to first order, $d\\ln A = 2\\,d\\varepsilon_{b}$.\n\nDerive an explicit expression for the mode-specific Grüneisen parameter $\\gamma_{i}$ in terms of the unstrained wavenumber $\\omega_{0}$ and the initial slope $\\left.\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{b}=0}$ of the Raman shift versus equibiaxial strain.

Do not include any units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics and continuum mechanics, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the mode-specific Grüneisen parameter, $\\gamma_{i}$, for the $E'$ phonon mode in monolayer $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$. The derivation must begin from the foundational definition provided:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} \\equiv -\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\omega_{i}}{\\partial \\ln V}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{i}$ is the angular frequency of the $i$-th phonon mode and $V$ is the crystal volume. The problem notes that the Raman wavenumber, which we denote as $\\omega$, can be used in place of the angular frequency, as the proportionality constant cancels when taking logarithmic derivatives. Thus, we work with:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\omega}{\\partial \\ln V}\n$$\n\nIn the specified experiment, the crystal is subjected to a uniform, equibiaxial in-plane strain, $\\varepsilon_{b}$, which is the sole independent variable controlling the state of the system near the unstrained state. Therefore, both the phonon wavenumber $\\omega$ and the volume $V$ can be considered as functions of $\\varepsilon_{b}$. This allows us to convert the partial derivatives into total derivatives with respect to a common parameter, $\\varepsilon_b$. Using the chain rule of differentiation, we can express $\\gamma_i$ as a ratio of derivatives with respect to $\\varepsilon_{b}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = -\\frac{\\frac{d(\\ln \\omega)}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}}{\\frac{d(\\ln V)}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}}\n$$\n\nWe must now evaluate the numerator and the denominator of this expression.\n\nFor the numerator, we apply the chain rule for the derivative of a natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln \\omega)}{d\\varepsilon_{b}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\n$$\n\nFor the denominator, we are given a critical piece of information derived from the experimental constraints. The problem states that for equibiaxial in-plane strain ($\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\varepsilon_b$) with negligible thickness change ($\\varepsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$), the relative volume change $d\\ln V$ is equal to the relative area change $d\\ln A$. Furthermore, to first order in strain, the area change is given by $d\\ln A = 2\\,d\\varepsilon_{b}$. Combining these yields the direct relationship between the differential change in volume and the differential change in biaxial strain:\n$$\nd\\ln V = 2\\,d\\varepsilon_{b}\n$$\nFrom this differential relationship, we can immediately find the derivative of $\\ln V$ with respect to $\\varepsilon_{b}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln V)}{d\\varepsilon_{b}} = 2\n$$\nThis result is a constant, valid for the small strains considered.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into our formula for $\\gamma_{i}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = -\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}}{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the Grüneisen parameter under these specific strain conditions:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = -\\frac{1}{2\\omega} \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of this quantity under the conditions for which the experimental data are provided, namely at zero strain ($\\varepsilon_{b} = 0$). At this point, the wavenumber is its unstrained value, $\\omega = \\omega_{0}$, and the derivative is the measured initial slope, $\\left.\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{b}=0}$. Therefore, the explicit expression for the Grüneisen parameter in terms of the given quantities is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = -\\frac{1}{2\\omega_{0}} \\left.\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{b}=0}\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required answer.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Unstrained wavenumber: $\\omega_{0} = 385.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n- Initial slope of wavenumber versus strain: $\\left.\\frac{d\\omega}{d\\varepsilon_{b}}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{b}=0} = -560.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = -\\frac{1}{2 \\times 385.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}} \\left(-560.0\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\\right)\n$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, rendering $\\gamma_{i}$ a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = \\frac{560.0}{2 \\times 385.0} = \\frac{560.0}{770.0}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} = \\frac{56}{77} = \\frac{8}{11} \\approx 0.727272...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\gamma_{i} \\approx 0.7273\n$$\nThis is the numerical value for the mode-specific Grüneisen parameter of the $E'$ mode under the specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7273}\n$$", "id": "2495747"}]}
