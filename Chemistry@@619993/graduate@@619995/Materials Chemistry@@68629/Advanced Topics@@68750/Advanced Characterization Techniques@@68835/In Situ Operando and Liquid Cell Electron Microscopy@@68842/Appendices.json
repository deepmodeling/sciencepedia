The scenario describes a standard problem in electron microscopy, specifically the analysis of electron scattering in a thin liquid specimen. The concepts of inelastic mean free path ($\\lambda$), Poisson statistics for scattering, and exponential attenuation (the Beer-Lambert law) are fundamental principles in this domain. The provided values for thickness ($t = 300\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), mean free path ($\\lambda = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), and accelerating voltage ($200\\,\\mathrm{keV}$) are realistic for a liquid cell TEM experiment. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without ambiguity or contradiction. The accelerating voltage parameter, while contextually relevant, is not required for the specific calculation involving $t$ and $\\lambda$, which does not constitute a flaw. The problem is a valid test of fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires a derivation based on first principles. Let us define $P_k(x)$ as the probability that an electron has undergone exactly $k$ inelastic scattering events after traveling a distance $x$ through the material. The fraction of electrons with zero inelastic scattering events is thus $P_0(t)$, which corresponds to the ratio $I_0/I_t$.\n\nThe inelastic mean free path, $\\lambda$, is the average distance an electron travels between inelastic collisions. Therefore, the probability of an inelastic scattering event occurring in an infinitesimally small path length $\\mathrm{d}x$ is given by $\\mathrm{d}p = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\lambda}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $I_{0}/I_{t} = P_0(t)$.\nFor an electron to have zero scattering events after traveling a distance $x + \\mathrm{d}x$, it must have had zero events up to distance $x$ and also zero events in the subsequent interval $\\mathrm{d}x$. The probability of no scattering in $\\mathrm{d}x$ is $(1 - \\mathrm{d}p) = (1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\lambda})$. As these events are independent, we can write:\n$$P_0(x + \\mathrm{d}x) = P_0(x) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nRearranging this expression, we get:\n$$\\frac{P_0(x + \\mathrm{d}x) - P_0(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = -\\frac{P_0(x)}{\\lambda}$$\nTaking the limit as $\\mathrm{d}x \\to 0$, we arrive at a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P_0(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} P_0(x)$$\nThis equation is solved with the initial condition that at the entrance of the material ($x=0$), no scattering has occurred, so $P_0(0) = 1$. The solution is a standard exponential decay function:\n$$P_0(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nEvaluating this for the total thickness $t$, we find the fraction of zero-loss electrons:\n$$ \\frac{I_0}{I_t} = P_0(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nThis result is consistent with the Poisson distribution. The mean number of events over a length $t$ is $\\mu = t/\\lambda$. The probability of observing $k=0$ events for a Poisson process is $P(N=0) = \\frac{\\mu^0 e^{-\\mu}}{0!} = e^{-\\mu} = \\exp(-t/\\lambda)$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for $\\langle N\\rangle$, the expected number of inelastic scattering events.\nThis quantity is, by definition, the mean of the Poisson distribution of scattering events. The rate of events per unit length is constant and equal to $1/\\lambda$. For a total path length of $t$, the expected number of events is the rate multiplied by the path length.\n$$ \\langle N\\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) \\times t = \\frac{t}{\\lambda} $$\nThis is the parameter $\\mu$ of the Poisson distribution, which is its expected value.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given $t = 300\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. First, we compute the key dimensionless parameter $t/\\lambda$.\n$$ \\frac{t}{\\lambda} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{120\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 2.5 $$\nNow we can evaluate the two required quantities.\n\n1.  The fraction of zero-loss electrons, $I_{0}/I_{t}$:\n$$ \\frac{I_0}{I_t} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\exp(-2.5) $$\nNumerically, this is $0.08208499...$.
