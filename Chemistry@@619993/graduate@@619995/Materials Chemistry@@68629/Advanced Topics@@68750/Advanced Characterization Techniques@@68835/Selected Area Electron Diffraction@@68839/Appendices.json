It is based on the established principles of Bragg's law and the geometry of electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope. All necessary parameters are provided with physically realistic values.

For first-order diffraction ($n=1$), this law is given by:\n$$ \\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength of the incident electrons, $d$ is the interplanar spacing, and $\\theta$ is the Bragg angle.

This diffracted beam travels the camera length $L$ from the specimen plane to the recording plane (detector). A right-angled triangle is formed with the camera length $L$ as the adjacent side and the ring radius $R$ as the opposite side to the angle $2\\theta$.

Using first-order propagation of uncertainty, the variance $(\\Delta a)^2$ is given by:\n$$(\\Delta a)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial K}\\right)^2 (\\Delta K)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial R_1}\\right)^2 (\\Delta R_1)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial R_2}\\right)^2 (\\Delta R_2)^2$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives of $a = K \\frac{N_1+N_2}{R_1\\sqrt{N_1} + R_2\\sqrt{N_2}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial K} = \\frac{N_1+N_2}{R_1\\sqrt{N_1} + R_2\\sqrt{N_2}} = \\frac{a}{K}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial R_1} = K(N_1+N_2) \\frac{-\\sqrt{N_1}}{(R_1\\sqrt{N_1} + R_2\\sqrt{N_2})^2} = -\\left(K \\frac{N_1+N_2}{R_1\\sqrt{N_1} + R_2\\sqrt{N_2}}\\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{N_1}}{R_1\\sqrt{N_1} + R_2\\sqrt{N_2}} = -a \\frac{\\sqrt{N_1}}{\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i}}$$\nBy symmetry,\n$$\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial R_2} = -a \\frac{\\sqrt{N_2}}{\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i}}$$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula, and using $\\Delta R_1 = \\Delta R_2 = \\Delta R$:\n$$(\\Delta a)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{K}\\right)^2 (\\Delta K)^2 + \\left(-a \\frac{\\sqrt{N_1}}{\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i}}\\right)^2 (\\Delta R)^2 + \\left(-a \\frac{\\sqrt{N_2}}{\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i}}\\right)^2 (\\Delta R)^2$$\n$$(\\Delta a)^2 = a^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta K}{K}\\right)^2 + \\frac{N_1}{(\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i})^2}(\\Delta R)^2 + \\frac{N_2}{(\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i})^2}(\\Delta R)^2 \\right]$$\n$$(\\Delta a)^2 = a^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta K}{K}\\right)^2 + \\frac{N_1+N_2}{(\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i})^2}(\\Delta R)^2 \\right]$$\nThis expression allows calculation of the uncertainty $\\Delta a$ from the uncertainties of the input parameters.\n\nNow we perform the numerical calculation using the provided data:\n- $(hkl)_1 = (200) \\implies N_1 = 2^2+0^2+0^2 = 4 \\implies \\sqrt{N_1} = 2$.\n- $(hkl)_2 = (220) \\implies N_2 = 2^2+2^2+0^2 = 8 \\implies \\sqrt{N_2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n- $R_1 = 13.80$ mm.\n- $R_2 = 19.52$ mm.\n- $K = 24.95$ mm·Å.\n- $\\Delta R = 0.040$ mm.\n- $\\Delta K = 0.080$ mm·Å.\n\nFirst, calculate the estimator for $a$. The denominator of the estimator is:\n$$\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i} = (13.80)(2) + (19.52)(2\\sqrt{2}) = 27.60 + 55.2105... \\approx 82.810506 \\text{ mm}$$\nNow, calculate $a$:\n$$a = K \\frac{N_1+N_2}{\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i}} = (24.95 \\text{ mm·Å}) \\frac{12}{82.810506 \\text{ mm}} \\approx 3.615453 \\text{ Å}$$\nTo convert to nanometers, we use $1$ nm $= 10$ Å:\n$$a \\approx 0.3615453 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nNext, calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta a$. To avoid rounding errors, it is best to calculate the relative uncertainty first and keep full precision for intermediate steps.\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta K}{K}\\right)^2 + \\frac{N_1+N_2}{(\\sum R_i\\sqrt{N_i})^2}(\\Delta R)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.080}{24.95}\\right)^2 + \\frac{12}{(82.810506)^2}(0.040)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^2 \\approx (1.028104 \\times 10^{-5}) + (2.799690 \\times 10^{-6}) = 1.308073 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta a}{a} = \\sqrt{1.308073 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.00361673$$\nFinally, the absolute uncertainty is:\n$$\\Delta a = a \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) \\approx (0.3615453 \\text{ nm}) \\times 0.00361673 \\approx 0.00130765 \\text{ nm}$$\nRounding the final results to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$a = 0.3615 \\text{ nm}$$\n$$\\Delta a = 0.001308 \\text{ nm}$$\n\nThe final results are $a = 0.3615$ nm and $\\Delta a = 0.001308$ nm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.3615 & 0.001308\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2521156"}]}
