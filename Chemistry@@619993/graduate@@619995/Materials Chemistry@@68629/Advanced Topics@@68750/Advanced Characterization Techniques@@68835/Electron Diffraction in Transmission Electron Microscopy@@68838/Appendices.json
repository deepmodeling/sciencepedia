It is based on fundamental principles of crystallography and wave mechanics as applied to electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope. All necessary parameters are provided, and the values are physically realistic. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe solution requires two parts: first, a derivation of the geometric relationship in electron diffraction from first principles, and second, a calculation of the camera length $L$ based on the provided data.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Diffraction Geometry Relationship\n\nElectron diffraction is governed by the principles of wave mechanics. An incident electron beam is described as a plane wave with a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_0$. A diffracted beam is described by a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\n$1$. The condition for elastic scattering, where the electron does not lose energy, dictates that the magnitude of the incident and diffracted wavevectors must be equal:\n$$|\\mathbf{k}| = |\\mathbf{k}_0| = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the electron wavelength.\n\n$2$. The condition for constructive interference from a periodic crystal lattice, known as the Laue condition, states that the change in the wavevector upon scattering, $\\Delta\\mathbf{k}$, must be equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, $\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}$:\n$$\\Delta\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{k}_0 = \\mathbf{g}_{hkl}$$\nThe vector $\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}$ is normal to the $(hkl)$ family of lattice planes.\n\n$3$. These two conditions are geometrically represented by the Ewald sphere construction. The wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}_0$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ are drawn originating from a common point, which is the center of the Ewald sphere. The sphere has a radius of $|\\mathbf{k}_0| = 2\\pi/\\lambda$. The vector $\\mathbf{k}_0$ is drawn to terminate at the origin, $O$, of the reciprocal lattice. The diffraction condition is satisfied if a reciprocal lattice point, $G$, corresponding to the vector $\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}$ from the origin $O$, lies on the surface of this sphere. The diffracted wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ then connects the center of the sphere to the point $G$.\n\n$4$. The vectors $\\mathbf{k}_0$, $\\mathbf{k}$, and $\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}$ form a closed triangle where $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k}_0 + \\mathbf{g}_{hkl}$. Since $|\\mathbf{k}| = |\\mathbf{k}_0|$, this is an isosceles triangle. The angle between the incident and diffracted beams, $\\mathbf{k}_0$ and $\\mathbf{k}$, is the scattering angle, which we will denote as $2\\theta$. From the geometry of this isosceles triangle, we can relate the lengths of the sides:\n$$|\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}| = 2 |\\mathbf{k}_0| \\sin(\\theta)$$\nHere, $\\theta$ is half the total scattering angle $2\\theta$, and it corresponds to the Bragg angle $\\theta_B$ in Bragg's law.\n\n$5$. Before proceeding, I must state the convention for the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. I will use the physics convention, where the magnitude is defined in terms of the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ as:\n$$|\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{d_{hkl}}$$\nSubstituting this and $|\\mathbf{k}_0|=2\\pi/\\lambda$ into the geometric relation gives:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{d_{hkl}} = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right) \\sin(\\theta_B)$$\nSimplifying this equation yields the familiar Bragg's Law:\n$$2 d_{hkl} \\sin(\\theta_B) = \\lambda$$\n\n$6$. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron wavelength $\\lambda$ is much smaller than the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$. For instance, $\\lambda \\sim 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{pm}$ and $d \\sim 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 200 \\ \\mathrm{pm}$. This implies that the Bragg angle $\\theta_B$ is very small. We can therefore apply the small-angle approximation:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_B) \\approx \\theta_B \\quad (\\text{in radians})$$\nBragg's law under this approximation becomes:\n$$2 d_{hkl} \\theta_B \\approx \\lambda \\implies \\theta_B \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{2d_{hkl}}$$\n\n$7$. The geometry within the TEM relates the scattering angle $2\\theta_B$ to the camera length $L$ and the radial distance $R$ of the diffraction spot from the central beam on the detector plane. The direct beam travels along the axis, while the diffracted beam is scattered by an angle $2\\theta_B$. In the projection onto the detector plane, a distance $L$ from the specimen, this forms a right-angled triangle where:\n$$\\tan(2\\theta_B) = \\frac{R}{L}$$\nApplying the small-angle approximation again, $\\tan(2\\theta_B) \\approx 2\\theta_B$, we obtain:\n$$2\\theta_B \\approx \\frac{R}{L}$$\n\n$8$. By equating the two expressions for $2\\theta_B$, we derive the required relationship connecting the macroscopic observables ($R$, $L$) with the microscopic crystal properties ($\\lambda$, $d_{hkl}$):\n$$2 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2d_{hkl}}\\right) \\approx \\frac{R}{L} \\implies \\frac{\\lambda}{d_{hkl}} \\approx \\frac{R}{L}$$\nThis can be written as $R d_{hkl} \\approx L\\lambda$. In terms of the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude $|\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}|$ (using my stated convention), this is:\n$$R \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}|}\\right) \\approx L\\lambda \\implies R \\approx \\frac{L\\lambda|\\mathbf{g}_{hkl}|}{2\\pi}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Camera Length\n\nWe now use the derived relation $L \\approx R d_{hkl} / \\lambda$ to compute the camera length.\n\n$1$. First, we must calculate the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ for the $(220)$ reflection in a cubic crystal with lattice parameter $a = 0.36 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The given formula is:\n$$d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$$\nFor the $(220)$ reflection, we have $h=2$, $k=2$, and $l=0$.\n$$d_{220} = \\frac{0.36 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{0.36 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{0.36}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.12728 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\n$2$. Next, we assemble the given values, ensuring consistent units. We will use SI units (meters).\n- Radial distance $R = 24 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 24 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Interplanar spacing $d_{220} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{8}} \\ \\mathrm{nm} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{8}} \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Wavelength $\\lambda = 2.51 \\ \\mathrm{pm} = 2.51 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\n$3$.
