The flux of sputtered atoms, $\\Phi_{atom}$, is the number of atoms removed per unit area per unit time:\n    $$\\Phi_{atom} = Y \\cdot \\Phi_{ion} = \\frac{Y I}{q L^2}$$\n    The volume removed per unit area per unit time is the product of the atom flux and the volume per atom, $V_{atom} = \\frac{1}{N_v}$.

By determining the minimum mass resolving power needed to distinguish between two such ions, you will gain a practical appreciation for the importance of high-resolution analysis and the distinct capabilities of different mass analyzer designs.", "problem": "A Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) analysis of a calcium-containing material suffers from an isobaric interference between singly charged calcium at nominal mass number $40$ ($^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$) and argon from the residual gas ($^{40}\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$).

Assume the following for this measurement:\n\n- The exact mass difference between the two isobars is $\\Delta m = 2.0774 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n- The relevant mass scale is centered at approximately $m = 39.9625\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n- The resolution criterion is the standard full width at half maximum (FWHM) “just resolved” condition for two equal-height peaks.\n- Consider common SIMS mass analyzers encountered in materials chemistry: quadrupole, time-of-flight, double-focusing magnetic sector, and Orbitrap-based SIMS.\n\nStarting from first principles that define mass resolving power in mass spectrometry and using only the given $\\Delta m$, $m$, and the stated resolution criterion, derive the minimum resolving power required to separate the two isobars under the stated condition, and then assess the feasibility of achieving this separation with each of the analyzers listed above based on typical, literature-reported resolving power ranges. Round your computed minimum resolving power to three significant figures. Express the minimum resolving power as a dimensionless number.", "solution": "The problem as stated has been subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, practical challenge in the field of analytical materials chemistry, specifically in mass spectrometry. All necessary data for the calculation are provided, and the question is unambiguous. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe central task is to determine the minimum mass resolving power, $R$, required to separate two isobaric ions, $^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$ and $^{40}\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$, and then to evaluate the suitability of various mass analyzers for this task.\n\nMass resolving power is fundamentally defined as the ability of a mass spectrometer to distinguish between ions of slightly different mass-to-charge ratios. It is a dimensionless quantity given by the formula:\n$$\nR = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m_{res}}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion of interest, and $\\Delta m_{res}$ is the smallest resolvable mass difference at that mass.\n\nThe problem specifies the resolution criterion to be the \"full width at half maximum (FWHM) 'just resolved' condition for two equal-height peaks.\" According to this standard definition, two peaks are considered resolved when the separation between their centers is equal to the FWHM of an individual peak. The peak separation is the exact mass difference between the two species, given as $\\Delta m$. Thus, for the peaks to be just resolved, the FWHM of the instrument's peaks at this mass, which corresponds to $\\Delta m_{res}$, must be equal to the given mass difference $\\Delta m$.\n\nThe provided givens are:\n- The mass at which the measurement is performed: $m = 39.9625\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n- The exact mass difference between the isobars: $\\Delta m = 2.0774 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n\nFollowing the FWHM resolution criterion, we set $\\Delta m_{res} = \\Delta m$. The minimum required resolving power is therefore:\n$$\nR_{min} = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nR_{min} = \\frac{39.9625\\,\\mathrm{u}}{2.0774 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 192368.826\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR_{min} \\approx 192000\n$$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $1.92 \\times 10^{5}$. This is a substantial resolving power requirement.\n\nNow, we assess the feasibility of achieving this resolving power with the common SIMS mass analyzers listed.\n\n1.  **Quadrupole Mass Analyzer**: A quadrupole mass filter operates by creating an oscillating electric field that allows only ions of a specific mass-to-charge ratio to pass through. Its resolving power is typically limited and is often operated at \"unit mass resolution,\" meaning it can distinguish $m/z = 40$ from $m/z = 41$, but not fine differences at the same nominal mass. The typical resolving power of a quadrupole is $R < 4000$. This is grossly insufficient to meet the required $R_{min} \\approx 192000$. Therefore, a quadrupole analyzer is not feasible for this separation.\n\n2.  **Time-of-Flight (ToF) Mass Analyzer**: A ToF analyzer separates ions based on their flight time through a field-free drift tube; ions of lower mass travel faster and arrive at the detector first. The resolving power is dependent on the length of the flight path and the use of an ion mirror (reflectron), which compensates for initial kinetic energy distributions. Standard commercial ToF-SIMS instruments typically offer resolving powers in the range of $R = 8000 - 15000$. High-performance ToF instruments can reach $R > 50000$, but achieving $R \\approx 192000$ is beyond the capability of almost all commercial ToF-SIMS systems. Thus, separation is generally not feasible with a ToF analyzer, except perhaps with highly specialized, non-commercial research instruments.\n\n3.  **Double-Focusing Magnetic Sector Analyzer**: This type of analyzer uses a combination of a magnetic field (for momentum separation) and an electric field (for kinetic energy focusing) to achieve very high mass resolution. These were the original high-resolution mass spectrometers. Their resolving power routinely exceeds $R = 10000$. High-performance magnetic sector instruments can be configured to operate at resolving powers of $R = 50000$ to well over $R = 100000$. Reaching the required $R_{min} \\approx 192000$ is challenging but achievable with a top-tier magnetic sector instrument operating at its maximum resolution settings, often at the cost of sensitivity. Therefore, separation is feasible with a high-performance double-focusing magnetic sector analyzer.\n\n4.  **Orbitrap-based SIMS**: The Orbitrap is a modern, high-performance mass analyzer where ions are trapped in an electrostatic field and their axial oscillation frequencies are measured. The frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass-to-charge ratio. This principle allows for very high resolving power and high mass accuracy. Commercial Orbitrap instruments routinely offer resolving powers of $R = 60000$ to $R = 240000$ at $m/z = 200$. The resolving power of an Orbitrap scales as $(m/z)^{-1/2}$. If an instrument has a resolving power of $R = 240000$ at $m/z = 200$, its resolving power at $m/z \\approx 40$ would be approximately $R_{40} = 240000 \\times \\sqrt{200/40} = 240000 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\approx 537000$. This value is significantly greater than the required $R_{min} \\approx 192000$. Therefore, an Orbitrap-based SIMS instrument is not only capable of this separation but can achieve it with considerable margin.\n\nIn summary, the minimum required resolving power is substantial. This requirement immediately disqualifies quadrupole analyzers and places the separation at or beyond the limit of typical ToF analyzers. The separation is demonstrably feasible with high-performance double-focusing magnetic sector and Orbitrap-based instruments.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.92 \\times 10^{5}}\n$$", "id": "2520585"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal for many SIMS experiments is quantification—determining precisely 'how much' of an element is present within the sample matrix.
