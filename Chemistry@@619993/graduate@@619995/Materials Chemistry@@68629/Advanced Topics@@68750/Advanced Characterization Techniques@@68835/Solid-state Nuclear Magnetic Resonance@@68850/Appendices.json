It does not exhibit any of the flaws that would render it invalid, such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or reliance on non-formalizable concepts.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be constructed.\n\nThe physical basis for Cross-Polarization is the transfer of magnetization between two distinct spin species, $I$ and $S$, when they are simultaneously irradiated with resonant RF fields (spin-locked). In the doubly rotating frame, the energy levels of each spin are determined by its interaction with its respective RF field, giving rise to energy splittings of $\\hbar \\omega_{1I}$ and $\\hbar \\omega_{1S}$.\n\nEfficient polarization transfer occurs via simultaneous, opposite-sense spin flips of an $I$ and an $S$ spin. This process is a zero-quantum (ZQ) transition, as the total magnetic quantum number is conserved ($\\Delta m_{I} + \\Delta m_{S} = 0$). The energy mismatch for this transition in the rotating frame is $\\Delta E = |\\hbar \\omega_{1I} - \\hbar \\omega_{1S}|$. In a static sample, the dipolar coupling that drives this process is time-independent, and effective transfer occurs only when the energy is conserved, i.e., $\\Delta E=0$, which gives the standard Hartmann-Hahn condition, $\\omega_{1I} = \\omega_{1S}$.\n\nUnder MAS, the heteronuclear dipolar interaction becomes time-dependent with the period of the sample rotation, $T_r = 1/\\nu_r$. This periodic modulation, as stated in Principle (ii), introduces a Fourier series of frequency components at integer multiples of the MAS frequency, $n \\omega_{r}$. According to Principle (iii), which is a statement of energy conservation, the energy mismatch $\\Delta E$ can be overcome if it is compensated by an energy quantum drawn from the periodic modulation. This leads to the sideband matching conditions. For a ZQ transition, the condition is:\n$$|\\hbar \\omega_{1I} - \\hbar \\omega_{1S}| = n \\hbar \\omega_{r}$$\nwhere $n$ is a non-zero integer. Dividing by the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$, we obtain the general CP-MAS sideband matching condition for ZQ transitions:\n$$|\\omega_{1I} - \\omega_{1S}| = n \\omega_{r}$$\nThe problem specifies a first-order matching condition, which implies $n=1$. The condition thus becomes:\n$$|\\omega_{1I} - \\omega_{1S}| = \\omega_{r}$$\nThis is the required derived relationship.\n\nWe now apply this condition to the specific parameters given. The relation $\\omega = 2\\pi \\nu$ allows us to express the condition in terms of linear frequencies:\n$$|2\\pi \\nu_{1I} - 2\\pi \\nu_{1S}| = 2\\pi \\nu_{r}$$\nDividing the entire equation by $2\\pi$ simplifies this to:\n$$|\\nu_{1I} - \\nu_{1S}| = \\nu_{r}$$\nThe problem uses $I = {^1}\\mathrm{H}$ and $S = {^13}\\mathrm{C}$, with the MAS frequency $\\nu_{r} = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. Furthermore, it is given that $\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}} > \\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}}$, which allows for the removal of the absolute value operator. This yields our first equation:\n$$\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}} - \\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}} = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$$\nThe second experimental constraint is that the two nutation frequencies are symmetric about a mean frequency $\\nu_{c} = 70.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. This is expressed as the arithmetic mean:\n$$\\frac{\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}} + \\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}}}{2} = \\nu_{c} = 70.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$$\nMultiplying by $2$ gives our second equation:\n$$\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}} + \\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}} = 2 \\times 70.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 140.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}}$ and $\\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}} - \\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}} = 12.5 \\\\\n\\nu_{1\\mathrm{H}} + \\nu_{1\\mathrm{C}} = 140.0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n(Units of $\\mathrm{kHz}$ are temporarily omitted for algebraic simplicity).

A ramp on the $I$ channel sweeps the $I$-spin rotating-frame energy splitting through a continuum of values, so that the coupled two-spin system undergoes an avoided crossing when the $I$ and $S$ splittings coincide; if the sweep is slow enough (adiabatic with respect to the heteronuclear dipolar coupling), the eigenstate is followed across the avoided crossing and polarization is transferred irrespective of local $B_{1}$ scaling. With nominal on-resonance tuning, the matching condition for a given crystallite reduces to $x=g/f$, hence to guarantee a crossing for all $f \\in [0.8,1.2]$ and $g \\in [0.9,1.1]$, the minimal ramp must include $x \\in [0.9/1.2,\\,1.1/0.8]=[0.75,\\,1.375]$.\n\nB. Because MAS averages anisotropies, the rotating-frame splittings are independent of the RF amplitudes during CP; therefore, ramping does not broaden the matching condition.

It is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem consists of two parts: a qualitative explanation of the ramped CP mechanism and a quantitative calculation of the ramp bounds.\n\n**Part 1: Qualitative Rationale for Ramped CP**\n\nIn a doubly rotating frame, with on-resonance RF fields applied to both spin species $I$ and $S$, the Hamiltonians for the spins are given by $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}_I = \\omega_{1I} \\hat{I}_x$ and $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}_S = \\omega_{1S} \\hat{S}_x$, assuming the RF fields are along the $x$-axis. The energy eigenvalues are quantized along this axis, and the energy splitting for each spin is its nutation frequency, $\\omega_{1I}$ and $\\omega_{1S}$, respectively.\n\nFor a non-interacting two-spin system, the total Hamiltonian is $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}_0 = \\omega_{1I} \\hat{I}_x + \\omega_{1S} \\hat{S}_x$. Polarization transfer involves a mutual \"flip-flop\" of the spins, corresponding to a transition between the states $|m_I=1/2, m_S=-1/2\\rangle_x$ and $|m_I=-1/2, m_S=1/2\\rangle_x$. This process is most efficient when it is energy-conserving. The energy difference between these two states is $E(+, -) - E(-, +) = (\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{1I} - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{1S}) - (-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{1I} + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_{1S}) = \\omega_{1I} - \\omega_{1S}$. Energy conservation thus requires the Hartmann-Hahn matching condition: $\\omega_{1I} = \\omega_{1S}$. At this condition, the two states are degenerate.\n\nThe heteronuclear dipolar coupling, $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}_D$, provides the mechanism for the flip-flop transition. In the doubly rotating frame, the relevant terms of $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}_D$ couple the degenerate states. This coupling, with strength quantified by a frequency $\\omega_D$, lifts the degeneracy. A plot of the energy eigenvalues of the coupled two-spin system versus the difference $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_{1I} - \\omega_{1S}$ reveals an \"avoided crossing,\" where the two energy levels approach each other but then diverge, separated by a minimum gap of $\\omega_D$ at the exact matching point $\\Delta\\omega = 0$.\n\nIn a standard CP experiment with fixed RF amplitudes, only those parts of the sample where $\\omega_{1I} \\approx \\omega_{1S}$ will exhibit efficient polarization transfer. Due to RF inhomogeneity, this condition is not met throughout the powder sample.\n\nBy ramping the amplitude of the $I$-channel RF field, the nutation frequency $\\omega_{1I}(t)$ is swept through a range of values. This means the energy difference $\\Delta\\omega(t) = \\omega_{1I}(t) - \\omega_{1S}$ is swept through the zero-crossing point. If this sweep is performed slowly enough (adiabatically) compared to the interaction strength, i.e., $|d(\\Delta\\omega)/dt| \\ll \\omega_D^2$, the system follows a single eigenstate through the avoided crossing. A system that starts, for example, in a state that is predominantly $|-,+\\rangle_x$ (polarization on spin $I$) will evolve into a state that is predominantly $|+,-\\rangle_x$ (polarization on spin $S$). This adiabatic passage ensures efficient polarization transfer. By sweeping $\\omega_{1I}(t)$ over a sufficiently wide range, we can ensure that every crystallite, with its own specific local RF fields, passes through its own Hartmann-Hahn matching condition at some point during the ramp, making the overall transfer process robust against $B_1$ inhomogeneity.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation of Ramp Bounds**\n\nThe problem states that at the sample center, where $f=1$ and $g=1$, the nominal settings are matched. The on-resonance Hartmann-Hahn condition is $\\omega_{1I} = \\omega_{1S}$. Therefore, the nominal settings must satisfy $\\omega_{1I}^{0} = \\omega_{1S}^{0}$.\n\nFor an arbitrary crystallite in the sample, characterized by inhomogeneity factors $f$ and $g$, the local nutation frequencies are:\n- $S$ spin (constant RF): $\\omega_{1S}^{\\text{local}} = g \\, \\omega_{1S}^{0}$\n- $I$ spin (ramped RF): The nominal setting is $x(t)\\omega_{1I}^{0}$. The local field is this value scaled by the inhomogeneity factor $f$. Thus, $\\omega_{1I}^{\\text{local}}(t) = f \\cdot (x(t) \\, \\omega_{1I}^{0})$.\n\nThe matching condition for this crystallite is met at an instant $t$ when $\\omega_{1I}^{\\text{local}}(t) = \\omega_{1S}^{\\text{local}}$.\n$$f \\, x(t) \\, \\omega_{1I}^{0} = g \\, \\omega_{1S}^{0}$$\nSince we established that $\\omega_{1I}^{0} = \\omega_{1S}^{0}$, this simplifies to:\n$$f \\, x(t) = g$$\n$$x(t) = \\frac{g}{f}$$\nTo guarantee that a match occurs for every crystallite in the sample, the ramp parameter $x$ must sweep through all possible values of the ratio $g/f$. We are given the ranges $f \\in [0.8, 1.2]$ and $g \\in [0.9, 1.1]$. We need to find the minimum and maximum of the function $h(f, g) = g/f$ over this domain.\n\nThe minimum value of $x$, $x_{\\min}$, is found by taking the minimum value of the numerator $g$ and the maximum value of the denominator $f$:\n$$x_{\\min} = \\frac{g_{\\min}}{f_{\\max}} = \\frac{0.9}{1.2} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\n\nThe maximum value of $x$, $x_{\\max}$, is found by taking the maximum value of the numerator $g$ and the minimum value of the denominator $f$:\n$$x_{\\max} = \\frac{g_{\\max}}{f_{\\min}} = \\frac{1.1}{0.8} = \\frac{11}{8} = 1.375$$\n\nTherefore, the tightest bounds on the ramp are $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}] = [0.75, 1.375]$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. A ramp on the $I$ channel sweeps the $I$-spin rotating-frame energy splitting through a continuum of values, so that the coupled two-spin system undergoes an avoided crossing when the $I$ and $S$ splittings coincide; if the sweep is slow enough (adiabatic with respect to the heteronuclear dipolar coupling), the eigenstate is followed across the avoided crossing and polarization is transferred irrespective of local $B_{1}$ scaling. With nominal on-resonance tuning, the matching condition for a given crystallite reduces to $x=g/f$, hence to guarantee a crossing for all $f \\in [0.8,1.2]$ and $g \\in [0.9,1.1]$, the minimal ramp must include $x \\in [0.9/1.2,\\,1.1/0.8]=[0.75,\\,1.375]$.**\n    This option provides a correct and complete qualitative explanation based on the principle of adiabatic passage through an avoided crossing. The quantitative part correctly derives the matching condition as $x=g/f$ and computes the correct minimal range $[0.75, 1.375]$ required to cover all specified inhomogeneities.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Because MAS averages anisotropies, the rotating-frame splittings are independent of the RF amplitudes during CP; therefore, ramping does not broaden the matching condition. Any observed improvement arises solely from reduced RF heating. The minimal useful ramp is arbitrarily narrow around $x=1$.**\n    This statement is fundamentally incorrect. MAS averages spatial anisotropies like CSA and dipolar couplings, but it does not average the RF field amplitude itself. The rotating-frame energy splitting (on resonance) *is* the nutation frequency, which is directly proportional to the RF amplitude. Ramping is therefore essential. Attributing the effect to RF heating is a misinterpretation.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Off-resonance CP equalizes laboratory-frame Zeeman energies by setting identical offsets on both channels, making polarization transfer independent of the RF amplitudes; thus, ramping the amplitude does not change the matching bandwidth, and no specific $[x_{\\min},x_{\\max}]$ is required beyond $x \\approx 1$.**\n    This statement is incorrect. CP is a rotating-frame phenomenon that matches energy splittings in that frame, not the vastly different laboratory-frame Zeeman energies. Polarization transfer is always dependent on RF amplitudes, as they define the rotating-frame splittings. The conclusion that ramping is ineffective is based on a false premise.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. To improve robustness, both channels must be ramped in lockstep by the same factor $x(t)$ so that their ratio remains fixed; this preserves the matching condition for the nominal case and therefore ensures transfer for all crystallites. The narrow interval $x \\in [0.85,\\,1.15]$ is sufficient to cover the stated inhomogeneities.**\n    This statement describes a flawed strategy. If both RF fields are ramped such that their ratio is constant, the matching condition becomes $f \\cdot x(t) \\omega_{1I}^0 = g \\cdot x(t) \\omega_{1S}^0$, which simplifies to $f=g$. This would only achieve matching for the subset of crystallites where the inhomogeneity factors for the two channels happen to be identical. It would not compensate for the general case where $f \\neq g$. The purpose of the ramp is to *sweep* the ratio of nutation frequencies to find the match, not to fix it.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2523913"}]}
