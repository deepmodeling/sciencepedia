It concerns the Hume–Rothery rules, which are foundational principles in materials science for predicting the formation of substitutional solid solutions. The concept of fractional size mismatch is a standard, well-defined quantitative measure. The provided values for metallic radii are physically realistic for elements in the periodic table. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without any internal contradictions. The terminology is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nStep 3: Solution Derivation.\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fractional size mismatch, or size factor, between a solute element $Y$ and a solvent element $X$. This factor, which we will denote as $\\Delta r$, is a key parameter in the first Hume–Rothery rule. It is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the solute and solvent atomic radii, normalized by the solvent atomic radius.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n$$ \\Delta r = \\frac{|r_{\\text{solute}} - r_{\\text{solvent}}|}{r_{\\text{solvent}}} $$\n\nIn this specific problem, the solvent is element $X$ and the solute is element $Y$. Thus, we have $r_{\\text{solvent}} = r_X$ and $r_{\\text{solute}} = r_Y$. Substituting the given values:\n- $r_X = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- $r_Y = 0.130\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ \\Delta r = \\frac{|r_Y - r_X|}{r_X} = \\frac{|0.130 - 0.150|}{0.150} $$\nThe units of nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, rendering the result a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a fractional mismatch.\n$$ \\Delta r = \\frac{|-0.020|}{0.150} = \\frac{0.020}{0.150} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta r = \\frac{2}{15} $$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$ \\Delta r = 0.133333... $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. This gives:\n$$ \\Delta r \\approx 0.1333 $$\nThe second part of the problem asks for an evaluation of this result against the Hume–Rothery size factor guideline for extensive substitutional solid solubility. The rule states that the size mismatch should be less than $15\\%$, which corresponds to a fractional value of $0.15$.\nWe must compare our calculated value to this threshold:\n$$ 0.1333  0.15 $$\nThe inequality holds true. Therefore, the size factor for the solute $Y$ in the solvent $X$ is favorable for the formation of an extensive substitutional solid solution according to this specific Hume–Rothery rule.

The type, number, and arrangement of these voids are intrinsic properties of the host's lattice, fundamentally dictating the potential for interstitial solubility.

It presents a standard, albeit non-trivial, problem in fundamental crystallography. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its solution by rigorous derivation from the given first principles.\n\nThe task is to determine the number of octahedral ($N_{\\mathrm{oct}}$) and tetrahedral ($N_{\\mathrm{tet}}$) interstitial sites per host atom for the face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattices. We will analyze each lattice structure systematically.\n\n**1. Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) Lattice**\n\nThe problem states that the conventional fcc unit cell contains $N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 4$ atoms. We enumerate the interstitial sites by their locations within this cubic cell.\n\n*   **Octahedral Sites in fcc:**\n    An octahedral site is surrounded by $6$ host atoms. In the fcc structure, these sites are found at two distinct types of locations:\n    1.  The body-center of the cube. There is $1$ such position, at fractional coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$. This position is not shared with any other unit cell, so its contribution is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n    2.  The centers of the $12$ edges of the cube. Example coordinates are $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)$, etc. Each edge is shared by $4$ unit cells, so each site contributes a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The total contribution from these sites is $12 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3$.\n\n    The total number of octahedral sites per unit cell is the sum of these contributions:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{oct, cell}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 1 + 3 = 4$$\n    The number of octahedral sites per host atom is then:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{oct, cell}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}}}{N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}}} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$$\n    Regarding symmetry, all $4$ of these octahedral sites are crystallographically equivalent under the operations of the fcc space group ($Fm\\bar{3}m$). They form a single, degenerate set of sites.\n\n*   **Tetrahedral Sites in fcc:**\n    A tetrahedral site is surrounded by $4$ host atoms. In the fcc structure, we can visualize the unit cell as being divided into $8$ smaller cubes (octants) of side length $a/2$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. The tetrahedral sites are located at the center of each of these $8$ octants.\n    1.  The fractional coordinates of these sites are of the form $(\\pm\\frac{1}{4}, \\pm\\frac{1}{4}, \\pm\\frac{1}{4})$. For example: $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4})$, $(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4})$, etc. There are $8$ such sites.\n    2.  All $8$ sites are located strictly inside the unit cell, so each contributes a factor of $1$.\n\n    The total number of tetrahedral sites per unit cell is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{tet, cell}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 8 \\times 1 = 8$$\n    The number of tetrahedral sites per host atom is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{tet, cell}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}}}{N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}}} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$$\n    Similarly to the octahedral sites, all $8$ tetrahedral sites are crystallographically equivalent and form a single degenerate set.\n\n**2. Body-Centered Cubic (bcc) Lattice**\n\nThe problem states that the conventional bcc unit cell contains $N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 2$ atoms.\n\n*   **Octahedral Sites in bcc:**\n    In the bcc lattice, the \"octahedral\" voids are not regular octahedra but are distorted. They are located at:\n    1.  The centers of the $6$ faces of the cube. Example coordinates are $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)$. Each face is shared by $2$ unit cells, so each site contributes $\\frac{1}{2}$. The total contribution is $6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$.\n    2.  The centers of the $12$ edges of the cube. Example coordinates are $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0, 0)$. Each edge is shared by $4$ unit cells, so each site contributes $\\frac{1}{4}$. The total contribution is $12 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 3$.\n\n    The total number of octahedral sites per unit cell is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{oct, cell}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 3 + 3 = 6$$\n    The number of octahedral sites per host atom is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{oct, cell}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}}}{N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$$\n    Unlike in the fcc case, these $6$ sites are not all crystallographically equivalent. The octahedral environment at a face center is different from that at an edge center due to different compression axes. Therefore, the bcc structure contains two distinct sets of symmetry-equivalent octahedral sites.\n\n*   **Tetrahedral Sites in bcc:**\n    The tetrahedral voids in bcc are also distorted. They are located on the faces of the unit cell.\n    1.  There are $4$ such sites on each of the $6$ faces. Their fractional coordinates are of the form $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, 0)$ and its permutations. This gives $4 \\times 6 = 24$ locations when considering all faces.\n    2.  Each of these sites lies on a face, shared between $2$ unit cells. Thus, each contributes a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n    The total number of tetrahedral sites per unit cell is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{tet, cell}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 24 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 12$$\n    The number of tetrahedral sites per host atom is:\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{tet, cell}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}}}{N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}}} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$$\n    All $12$ of these tetrahedral sites per unit cell are crystallographically equivalent under the bcc space group ($Im\\bar{3}m$), forming a single degenerate set.\n\n**3. Hexagonal Close-Packed (hcp) Lattice**\n\nThe problem specifies that the hcp unit cell contains $N_{\\mathrm{host}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} = 2$ atoms. This corresponds to the primitive hcp cell. A crucial insight from first principles is that both fcc and hcp structures are formed by the stacking of close-packed planes of atoms. The fcc structure has an `ABCABC...` stacking sequence, while hcp has an `ABABAB...` sequence.\n\nThe number of interstitial voids per atom is determined solely by the local geometry of how these close-packed planes are stacked. Since the local coordination and packing density are identical for any two adjacent planes in both fcc and hcp, the ratio of voids to atoms must also be identical. The derivation for fcc is thus a general derivation for any close-packed structure.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce the results for hcp from our rigorous enumeration for fcc.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} = N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 1$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} = N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 2$$\n\nFor completeness, we address the site degeneracy. In the hcp structure (space group $P6_3/mmc$):\n*   All octahedral sites are crystallographically equivalent, forming one set.\n*   The tetrahedral sites are not all equivalent. They partitioned into two distinct sets: one set of tetrahedra points \"up\" along the c-axis, and the other points \"down\". These two orientations are not related by any symmetry operation of the hcp space group.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSummarizing the number of sites per host atom for each lattice:\n*   fcc: $N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 1$, $N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 2$\n*   bcc: $N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 3$, $N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 6$\n*   hcp: $N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} = 1$, $N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} = 2$\n\nThese values must be arranged in the specified row matrix format.\n$$\n\\big[\\,N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} \\;\\; N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{fcc}} \\;\\; N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} \\;\\; N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{bcc}} \\;\\; N_{\\mathrm{oct}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}} \\;\\; N_{\\mathrm{tet}}^{\\mathrm{hcp}}\\,\\big] = \\big[\\,1 \\;\\; 2 \\;\\; 3 \\;\\; 6 \\;\\; 1 \\;\\; 2\\,\\big]\n$$\nThe derivation is complete and logically sound.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  2  3  6  1  2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2492197"}, {"introduction": "While geometric factors like atomic size provide useful guidelines, the true tendency for two elements to mix is governed by thermodynamics, specifically the change in Gibbs free energy upon mixing.

Thus, we can write the molar enthalpy of mixing in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}$ as:\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} [\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}] = z x_A x_B \\delta\\varepsilon[\\mathrm{eV}] \\times C[\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}/\\mathrm{eV}]$$\n\nFirst, calculate $\\delta\\varepsilon$ from the given bond energies:\n$$\\delta\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{AB} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\varepsilon_{AA} + \\varepsilon_{BB})$$\n$$\\delta\\varepsilon = -0.205\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{1}{2}(-0.240\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.200\\,\\mathrm{eV})$$\n$$\\delta\\varepsilon = -0.205\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{1}{2}(-0.440\\,\\mathrm{eV})$$\n$$\\delta\\varepsilon = -0.205\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 0.220\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNow, substitute all values into the expression for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$z = 12$\n$x_A = 0.70$\n$x_B = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$\n$\\delta\\varepsilon = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$C = 96.485332123\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}/\\mathrm{eV}$\n\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 12 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.015 \\times 96.485332123$$\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = (2.52 \\times 0.015) \\times 96.485332123$$\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0.0378 \\times 96.485332123$$\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 3.647145558\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 3.647\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol}^{-1}$$\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ indicates that like atoms prefer to bond with like atoms, and there is a tendency for phase separation at low temperatures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.647}$$", "id": "2492207"}]}
