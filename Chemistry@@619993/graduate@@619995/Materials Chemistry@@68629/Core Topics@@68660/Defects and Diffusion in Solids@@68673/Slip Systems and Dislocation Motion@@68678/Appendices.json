Second, the determination of the theoretical maximum Schmid factor. We begin by establishing the fundamental relationship from first principles as required.\n\nFor a uniaxial tensile stress of magnitude $\\sigma$ applied along the direction of a unit vector $\\mathbf{p}$, the Cauchy stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\otimes \\mathbf{p})$. A slip system is defined by the slip plane unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ and the slip direction unit vector $\\mathbf{s}$, which are mutually orthogonal, i.e., $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = 0$. The traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ on the slip plane is given by Cauchy's law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\big(\\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\otimes \\mathbf{p})\\big) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{p}\n$$\nThe resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{RSS}}$, is the scalar projection of the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ onto the slip direction $\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{RSS}} = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\big(\\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{p}\\big) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})(\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s})\n$$\nThe angles $\\phi$ and $\\lambda$ are defined as the angle between the tensile axis and the slip-plane normal, and the angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction, respectively. Thus, $\\cos\\phi = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ and $\\cos\\lambda = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$. The Schmid factor, $m$, is defined as $m \\equiv \\tau_{\\mathrm{RSS}}/\\sigma$, which gives the expression:\n$$\nm = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda\n$$\nPlastic deformation is governed by the magnitude of the resolved shear stress, so we seek the maximum value of $|m|$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Schmid factor for the specified loading condition. The crystal is face-centered cubic (FCC), and the uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$ is applied along the crystallographic direction $[100]$. The loading direction unit vector is therefore $\\mathbf{p} = [1,0,0]$. The active slip systems are of the $\\{111\\}\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. A plane normal vector is of the form $[hkl]$ where $h, k, l$ are permutations of $\\pm 1$. The corresponding unit vector is $\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[hkl]$. A slip direction vector is of the form $[uvw]$ where $u,v,w$ are permutations of $\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0$. The corresponding unit vector is $\\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[uvw]$.\nWe calculate the dot products for the general case with $\\mathbf{p} = [1,0,0]$:\n$$\n\\cos\\phi = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = [1,0,0] \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[hkl] = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\lambda = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = [1,0,0] \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[uvw] = \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe Schmid factor is then $m = \\frac{hu}{\\sqrt{6}}$. To find the most favorably oriented system, we must find the combination of a valid slip plane and slip direction that maximizes $|m|$. The value of $|h|$ for a $\\{111\\}$ plane is always $1$. The value of $|u|$ for a $\\langle 110\\rangle$ direction can be $1$ or $0$. The maximum magnitude of $m$ is attained when $|h|=1$ and $|u|=1$, which gives $|m| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$. We must verify that such a slip system exists. Consider the slip plane $(111)$, for which $\\mathbf{n} \\propto [111]$ and $h=1$. The slip directions in this plane must be orthogonal to $[111]$. The direction $[10\\bar{1}]$ is of the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ family, and its dot product with $[111]$ is $(1)(1) + (1)(0) + (1)(-1) = 0$. So, $(111)[10\\bar{1}]$ is a valid slip system. For this system, $h=1$ and $u=1$, giving $m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$. There are $8$ such systems with $|m| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$ and $4$ systems with $m=0$. Thus, the Schmid factor for the most favorably oriented system under $[100]$ loading is $m_{[100]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the maximum possible value of the Schmid factor over all possible tensile axis orientations for a fixed slip system. We wish to maximize $m = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda$ where $\\phi$ and $\\lambda$ are orientation-dependent. Let the fixed slip system be defined by the orthonormal vectors $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{s}$. Without loss of generality, we can align our coordinate system such that $\\mathbf{s} = [1,0,0]$ and $\\mathbf{n} = [0,1,0]$. The tensile axis is a general unit vector $\\mathbf{p} = [p_1, p_2, p_3]$ with the constraint $p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 = 1$. The dot products are:\n$$\n\\cos\\lambda = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = p_1\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\phi = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = p_2\n$$\nWe must maximize the function $m(p_1, p_2, p_3) = p_1 p_2$ subject to the constraint $p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 = 1$. To maximize the product $p_1 p_2$ for a given sum of squares, we must set $p_3=0$. The problem reduces to maximizing $m(p_1, p_2) = p_1 p_2$ subject to $p_1^2 + p_2^2 = 1$. Using a parameterization $p_1 = \\cos\\theta$ and $p_2 = \\sin\\theta$, the expression becomes $m(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta)$. The maximum value of $\\sin(2\\theta)$ is $1$, which occurs when $2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, or $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The maximum value of the Schmid factor is therefore $m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe angles $\\phi_{\\max}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}$ correspond to this optimal orientation. At $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n$$\n\\cos\\lambda_{\\max} = p_1 = \\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\Big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\phi_{\\max} = p_2 = \\sin\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\Big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThis yields the angles $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\arccos\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians and $\\phi_{\\max} = \\arccos\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians. This demonstrates that the theoretical maximum Schmid factor is $m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$, achieved when the tensile axis is oriented at an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to both the slip direction and the slip plane normal.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(m_{[100]},\\,m_{\\max},\\,\\phi_{\\max},\\,\\lambda_{\\max})$.\n$m_{[100]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}$\n$m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\phi_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n$\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\pi}{4} & \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2523230"}, {"introduction": "In many materials, perfect dislocations lower their energy by dissociating into partial dislocations separated by a stacking fault.

Real cubic crystals are described by three independent elastic constants ($C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, $C_{44}$), not two (shear modulus $\\mu$, Poisson's ratio $\\nu$).

Using an averaged, isotropic shear modulus is a simplification that can introduce significant error, potentially on the order of $10-30\\%$ depending on the material's anisotropy ratio.

The elastic self-energy of a dislocation line is proportional to the square of its Burgers vector magnitude, $G b^{2}$. Thus, the condition for an energetically favorable reaction is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{3}|^{2} < |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^{2} + |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^{2} $$\n\nWe calculate the square of the magnitude for each Burgers vector:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{6}\\right)^{2} (1^{2} + (-2)^{2} + 1^{2}) = \\frac{a^{2}}{36} (1 + 4 + 1) = \\frac{6a^{2}}{36} = \\frac{a^{2}}{6} $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{6}\\right)^{2} ((-2)^{2} + 1^{2} + (-1)^{2}) = \\frac{a^{2}}{36} (4 + 1 + 1) = \\frac{6a^{2}}{36} = \\frac{a^{2}}{6} $$\nThe sum for the reactants is:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^{2} + |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^{2} = \\frac{a^{2}}{6} + \\frac{a^{2}}{6} = \\frac{2a^{2}}{6} = \\frac{a^{2}}{3} $$\nNow for the product:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{3}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{6}\\right)^{2} ((-1)^{2} + (-1)^{2} + 0^{2}) = \\frac{a^{2}}{36} (1 + 1 + 0) = \\frac{2a^{2}}{36} = \\frac{a^{2}}{18} $$\nComparing the energies before and after the reaction:\n$$ \\frac{a^{2}}{18} < \\frac{a^{2}}{3} $$\nThis inequality is true, as $\\frac{1}{18} < \\frac{6}{18}$. The total line energy is reduced, confirming that the formation of the Lomer-Cottrell lock is an energetically favorable process. The sessile nature of this lock acts as a strong barrier to further dislocation motion, contributing to strain hardening in the material.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{a}{6}[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]}\n$$", "id": "2523211"}]}
