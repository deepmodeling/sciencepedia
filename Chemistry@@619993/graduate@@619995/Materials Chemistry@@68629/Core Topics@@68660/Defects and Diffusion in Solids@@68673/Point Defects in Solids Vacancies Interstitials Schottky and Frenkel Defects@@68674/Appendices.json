A Schottky defect is the formation of a stoichiometric vacancy pair $V_{M} + V_{X}$ by removing one $M$ and one $X$ ion from their respective sublattices to the surface or a reservoir.

It represents a standard problem in the statistical thermodynamics of point defects in solids. I shall proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the equilibrium number of Schottky defects, $n$, in a binary ionic crystal $MX$ and then calculate its value under given conditions. The equilibrium state corresponds to the minimum of the Helmholtz free energy, $F$, with respect to the number of defects, $n$. The Helmholtz free energy is defined as $F = E - T S$.\n\nFirst, we formulate the expression for $F(n)$. The total energy cost to create $n$ Schottky pairs is given as $E = n E_{f}^{\\mathrm{Sch}}$.

This term arises from changes in the vibrational spectrum of the crystal lattice around the defects.\n\nThe configurational entropy, $S_{config}$, is calculated from the number of ways, $\\Omega$, to arrange the defects on the lattice sites. A Schottky defect in an $MX$ crystal consists of one cation vacancy, $V_M$, and one anion vacancy, $V_X$. We must place $n$ cation vacancies on $N$ available cation sites and $n$ anion vacancies on $N$ available anion sites. The number of ways to arrange the $n$ indistinguishable cation vacancies on the $N$ cation sites is given by the binomial coefficient $\\Omega_M = \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}$. Similarly, for the anion vacancies, $\\Omega_X = \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}$.\nSince the arrangements on the two sublattices are independent, the total number of microstates is the product $\\Omega = \\Omega_M \\Omega_X = \\left( \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} \\right)^2$.\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann formula, the configurational entropy is $S_{config} = k_B \\ln \\Omega$.\n$$S_{config} = k_B \\ln \\left[ \\left( \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} \\right)^2 \\right] = 2k_B \\ln \\left( \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} \\right)$$\n$$S_{config} = 2k_B (\\ln(N!) - \\ln(n!) - \\ln((N-n)!))$$\nThe total Helmholtz free energy is therefore:\n$$F(n) = E - T S = n E_{f}^{\\mathrm{Sch}} - T(n S_{f}^{\\mathrm{Sch}} + S_{config})$$\n$$F(n) = n E_{f}^{\\mathrm{Sch}} - n T S_{f}^{\\mathrm{Sch}} - 2k_B T (\\ln(N!) - \\ln(n!) - \\ln((N-n)!))$$\nTo find the equilibrium number of defects, $n_{eq}$, we must minimize $F(n)$ with respect to $n$.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Compensation Pathways\n\nThe problem requires the identification of two fundamental equilibrium reactions that describe the charge compensation pathways for the donor defect $D_{A}^{\\cdot}$.\n\n**1. Electronic Compensation Pathway**\nThis pathway involves the compensation of the positive charge of $D_{A}^{\\cdot}$ by negatively charged electrons, $e^{\\prime}$. The electrons are generated by the ionization of the donor dopant. A neutral donor defect, denoted $D_{A}^{x}$, ionizes to produce the positively charged donor $D_{A}^{\\cdot}$ and a free electron $e^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe defect reaction must conserve mass, lattice sites, and effective charge.\n- Reactant: $D_{A}^{x}$ (neutral dopant on an $A$-site, effective charge $0$).\n- Products: $D_{A}^{\\cdot}$ (ionized dopant on an $A$-site, effective charge $+1$) and $e^{\\prime}$ (free electron, effective charge $-1$).\n\nThe balanced reaction is:\n$$D_{A}^{x} \\rightleftharpoons D_{A}^{\\cdot} + e^{\\prime}$$\n- **Mass Balance:** One $D$ atom on both sides. Correct.\n- **Site Balance:** One $A$-site is occupied on both sides. Correct.\n- **Charge Balance:** $0 \\rightleftharpoons (+1) + (-1) = 0$. Correct.\n\nThe corresponding law of mass action is given by the equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{ion}}$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{a(D_{A}^{\\cdot}) \\, a(e^{\\prime})}{a(D_{A}^{x})}$$\nApplying the given approximations ($a(X) \\approx [X]$, and $n=[e^{\\prime}]$):\n$$K_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\approx \\frac{[D_{A}^{\\cdot}] \\, n}{[D_{A}^{x}]}$$\n\n**2. Oxygen Vacancy Compensation Pathway**\nThis pathway involves the formation of positively charged oxygen vacancies, $V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$, which can contribute to the overall charge balance. The problem specifies that this pathway must be described by an equilibrium with oxygen gas. This corresponds to the reduction of the oxide, where an oxygen ion from the lattice, $O_{O}^{x}$, is removed to form a vacancy, $V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$, and molecular oxygen in the gas phase, $O_{2}(g)$.\n\nWhen a neutral oxygen ion, $O^{2-}$, is removed from a lattice site $O_{O}^{x}$, it leaves behind a vacancy with an effective charge of $+2$ and releases two electrons into the crystal.\n- Reactant: $O_{O}^{x}$ (oxygen on an O-site, effective charge $0$).\n- Products: $V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$ (vacancy on an O-site, effective charge $+2$), $\\frac{1}{2}O_{2}(g)$ (oxygen gas), and $2e^{\\prime}$ (two electrons, effective charge $-1$ each).\n\nThe balanced reaction for this reduction process is:\n$$O_{O}^{x} \\rightleftharpoons V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\frac{1}{2}O_{2}(g) + 2e^{\\prime}$$\n- **Mass Balance:** One oxygen atom on both sides. Correct.\n- **Site Balance:** One O-site is involved on both sides. Correct.\n- **Charge Balance:** $0 \\rightleftharpoons (+2) + 2(-1) = 0$. Correct.\n\nThe corresponding law of mass action is given by the equilibrium constant $K_{V}$. The activity of a gas is its partial pressure raised to its stoichiometric exponent.\n$$K_{V} = \\frac{a(V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}) \\, a(O_{2}(g))^{1/2} \\, a(e^{\\prime})^{2}}{a(O_{O}^{x})}$$\nSubstituting the partial pressure $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ for the activity of oxygen gas and applying the other given approximations ($a(O_{O}^{x}) \\approx 1$, $a(X) \\approx [X]$, and $n=[e^{\\prime}]$):\n$$K_{V} \\approx [V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\, p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/2} \\, n^{2}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to match the format in the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Evaluation of Option A:**\n- **Electronic compensation reaction:** $D_{A}^{x} \\rightleftharpoons D_{A}^{\\cdot} + e^{\\prime}$. This is a correctly balanced reaction for donor ionization and matches our derivation.\n- **Electronic compensation mass-action law:** $K_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\dfrac{a\\!\\left(D_{A}^{\\cdot}\\right)\\,a\\!\\left(e^{\\prime}\\right)}{a\\!\\left(D_{A}^{x}\\right)} \\approx \\dfrac{[D_{A}^{\\cdot}]\\,n}{[D_{A}^{x}]}$. This is the correct expression corresponding to the reaction.\n- **Oxygen nonstoichiometry reaction:** $O_{O}^{x} \\rightleftharpoons V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\dfrac{1}{2}O_{2}(g) + 2\\,e^{\\prime}$. This is the correctly balanced reaction for the formation of oxygen vacancies by reduction, in equilibrium with the gas phase, as derived above.\n- **Oxygen nonstoichiometry mass-action law:** $K_{V} = \\dfrac{a\\!\\left(V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}\\right)\\,a\\!\\left(e^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\,p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/2}}{a\\!\\left(O_{O}^{x}\\right)} \\approx [V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]\\,n^{2}\\,p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/2}$.

The activity of the product $O_2(g)$ correctly appears as $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/2}$ in the numerator.\nBoth pathways are described by valid, fundamental defect equilibria and their correct mass-action laws.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Evaluation of Option B:**\n- **Electronic compensation reaction:** $D_{A}^{\\cdot} \\rightleftharpoons D_{A}^{x} + e^{\\prime}$. The charge balance is $(+1) \\rightleftharpoons 0 + (-1) = -1$.

The charge balance is $0 \\rightleftharpoons (+2)$. The reaction is not balanced and is therefore invalid. It is missing the two product electrons.\nThis option contains two invalid reactions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Evaluation of Option C:**\n- **Oxygen-vacancy compensation reaction:** $2\\,D_{A}^{\\cdot} \\rightleftharpoons V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$. This is not a valid elementary defect reaction. It violates mass balance ($2D$ atoms on the left, $0$ on the right) and site balance ($2$ $A$-sites on the left, $1$ $O$-site on the right). This expression resembles a simplified electroneutrality condition ($2[V_O^{\\bullet\\bullet}] = [D_A^\\cdot]$) but is not a physical process or a valid chemical reaction.\n- **Electronic equilibrium reaction:** $e^{\\prime} \\rightleftharpoons \\dfrac{1}{2}O_{2}(g)$. This reaction is nonsensical. It violates mass balance ($0$ atoms on the left, $1$ O atom on the right) and charge balance ($-1$ on the left, $0$ on the right).\nThis option contains two invalid reactions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Evaluation of Option D:**\n- **Hole compensation reaction:** $D_{A}^{x} \\rightleftharpoons D_{A}^{\\cdot} + h^{\\bullet}$. The charge balance is $0 \\rightleftharpoons (+1) + (+1) = +2$. The reaction is not balanced. Furthermore, a donor defect by definition donates an electron, not a hole. The creation of a hole is characteristic of an acceptor defect. This reaction is both unbalanced and conceptually incorrect for a donor.\n- **Oxygen-vacancy formation reaction:** $O_{O}^{x} + h^{\\bullet} \\rightleftharpoons V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\dfrac{1}{2}O_{2}(g)$. The charge balance is $0 + (+1) \\rightleftharpoons (+2)$, which simplifies to $+1 \\rightleftharpoons +2$. The reaction is not balanced. The correctly balanced reaction for vacancy formation via oxidation (consumption of holes) requires two holes: $O_{O}^{x} + 2h^{\\bullet} \\rightleftharpoons V_{O}^{\\bullet\\bullet} + \\dfrac{1}{2}O_{2}(g)$.\nThis option contains two invalid reactions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option A provides a thermodynamically consistent and correctly formulated pair of pathways.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2512149"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between theoretical models and experimental reality, a vital skill for any materials scientist.

It is well-posed, providing two independent experimental results (slopes) to determine two unknown parameters ($H_f$ and $H_m$). All terms are defined, and the data are physically plausible. The problem is valid. We proceed to the derivation.\n\nThe electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ due to ionic transport is given by the relation:\n$$ \\sigma = n |q| \\mu $$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of charge carriers, $|q|$ is the magnitude of their charge, and $\\mu$ is their mobility.\n\nFor this problem, the charge carriers are cation vacancies.\n- The number density of vacancies is $n = N c(T)$, where $N$ is the number of cation sites per unit volume and $c(T)$ is the site fraction of vacancies.\n- The charge of a cation vacancy is effectively negative. The problem states the charge number is $z=1$, so the magnitude of the charge is $|q| = ze = e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\n- The vacancy mobility $\\mu$ is related to the vacancy diffusivity $D$ through the Nernst-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{|q| D}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\frac{eD}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} $$\nThe diffusivity itself is thermally activated and follows an Arrhenius equation characterized by the migration enthalpy $H_m$:\n$$ D(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\nwhere $D_0$ is a pre-exponential factor.\n\nThe problem gives the Arrhenius form for the vacancy concentration:\n$$ c(T) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_f}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for conductivity:\n$$ \\sigma(T) = \\big(N c(T)\\big) (e) \\left(\\frac{eD(T)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) = \\frac{N e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} c(T) D(T) $$\n$$ \\sigma(T) = \\frac{N e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\left(c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_f}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right) \\left(D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma(T) = \\frac{N c_0 D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_f + H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\nThis expression reveals why plotting $\\sigma(T)$ versus $1/T$ is complicated by the $1/T$ term in the pre-exponential factor. The standard procedure, as indicated in the problem, is to analyze $\\sigma(T)T$.\n$$ \\sigma(T)T = \\frac{N c_0 D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_f + H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm, we obtain the equation for the first plot:\n$$ \\ln\\big[\\sigma(T)T\\big] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N c_0 D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right) - \\frac{H_f + H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\frac{1}{T} $$\nThis is a linear relationship between $\\ln[\\sigma(T)T]$ and $1/T$. The slope is given by $m_1 = -\\frac{H_f + H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$. Thus, the first plot provides the sum of the formation and migration enthalpies.\n\nUsing the given slope $m_1 = -2.78 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ H_f + H_m = -m_1 k_{\\mathrm{B}} = -(-2.78 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}) (8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) $$\n$$ H_f + H_m = 2.395526\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\approx 2.40\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the second plot. The quantity is $\\sigma(T)T/c(T)$. Using our expressions:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma(T)T}{c(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{N c_0 D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_f + H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)}{c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_f}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)} = \\frac{N D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm gives the equation for the second plot:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(T)T}{c(T)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right) - \\frac{H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\frac{1}{T} $$\nThis is a linear relationship between $\\ln[\\sigma(T)T/c(T)]$ and $1/T$. The slope is $m_2 = -\\frac{H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}$. This plot successfully isolates the migration enthalpy $H_m$.\n\nUsing the given slope $m_2 = -1.35 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ H_m = -m_2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} = -(-1.35 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}) (8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) $$\n$$ H_m = 1.163295\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.16\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\n\nFinally, we can determine the formation enthalpy $H_f$ by subtraction:\n$$ H_f = (H_f + H_m) - H_m = 2.395526\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 1.163295\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.232231\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.23\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\n\nNow, let us evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\nA. Use $\\ln\\!\\big[\\sigma(T)\\,T/c(T)\\big]$ versus $1/T$ to isolate the migration process, giving $H_{m}=1.16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Use $\\ln\\!\\big[\\sigma(T)\\,T\\big]$ versus $1/T$ to obtain the sum $H_{f}+H_{m}=2.40\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, hence $H_{f}=1.23\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- The proposed plotting strategies are correct, as shown in our derivation.\n- The calculated value for $H_m$, rounded to two decimal places, is $1.16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. This is correct.\n- The calculated value for $H_f+H_m$, rounded to two decimal places, is $2.40\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. This is correct.\n- The calculated value for $H_f$, rounded to two decimal places, is $1.23\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. This is also correct.\nThere is a minor logical inconsistency in the statement: if one takes the reported rounded values of $H_f+H_m=2.40\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $H_m=1.16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ as exact, their difference is $2.40 - 1.16 = 1.24\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, not $1.23\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. This discrepancy arises from rounding intermediate results. However, the value $H_f=1.23\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is the correctly rounded result of the calculation using unrounded intermediate values, which is the proper scientific procedure. Therefore, despite the slightly imprecise use of the word \"hence,\" the option presents the correct physical reasoning and the correct final numerical values. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Use $\\ln\\!\\big[\\sigma(T)/c(T)\\big]$ versus $1/T$ to isolate the migration process, giving $H_{m}=1.16\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Use $\\ln\\!\\big[\\sigma(T)\\big]$ versus $1/T$ to obtain $H_{f}+H_{m}=2.40\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, hence $H_{f}=1.24\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- The proposed plotting strategies are fundamentally flawed. A plot of $\\ln[\\sigma(T)/c(T)]$ versus $1/T$ is not linear.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(T)}{c(T)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N D_0 e^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right) - \\ln(T) - \\frac{H_m}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} $$\nThe presence of the $-\\ln(T)$ term means the graph is not a straight line, and a simple linear fit cannot be used to extract $H_m$. Similarly, a plot of $\\ln(\\sigma)$ vs $1/T$ is also not linear. The correct approach uses $\\sigma(T)T$. Because the proposed method is incorrect, the option is invalid. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Use $\\log_{10}\\!\\big[\\sigma(T)\\,T/c(T)\\big]$ versus $1/T$ and $\\log_{10}\\!\\big[\\sigma(T)\\,T\\big]$ versus $1/T$; convert slopes directly to activation energies without any numerical factor, giving $H_{m}=2.68\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $H_{f}=2.84\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- While using base-10 logarithm ($\\log_{10}$) is possible, the conversion to energy involves a factor of $2.303 k_{\\mathrm{B}}$, not a direct conversion as claimed. The statement \"without any numerical factor\" is false. Furthermore, the problem provides slopes for natural logarithm ($\\ln$) plots. The numerical values are inconsistent with our calculations and appear arbitrary. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Separation of $H_{f}$ and $H_{m}$ is not possible from $\\sigma(T)$ and $c(T)$ alone; tracer diffusion or a Haven ratio is required, so no unique numerical values can be obtained here.\n- This statement is false. Our derivation explicitly shows that combining the measurement of $\\sigma(T)$ (which depends on the product $c \\cdot \\mu$) and an independent measurement of $c(T)$ allows for the separation of the activation energies $H_f$ and $H_m$. We were given precisely the necessary information to perform this separation. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that presents correct physical principles, correct plotting strategies, and correctly calculated numerical results, despite a minor imprecision in its wording concerning rounding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2512150"}]}
