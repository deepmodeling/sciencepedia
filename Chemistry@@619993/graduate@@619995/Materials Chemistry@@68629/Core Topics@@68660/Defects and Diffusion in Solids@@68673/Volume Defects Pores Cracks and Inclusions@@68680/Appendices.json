This threshold condition implies that the void is in a state of unstable equilibrium with the surrounding vacancy concentration in the matrix. In classical nucleation theory, this corresponds to the void having the critical radius, $r^*$, for homogeneous nucleation at that specific supersaturation.\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, associated with the formation of a spherical void of radius $r$ from a supersaturated solution of vacancies is given by the sum of the energy required to create the void surface and the energy gained from the condensation of vacancies:\n$$\n\\Delta G(r) = 4\\pi r^2 \\gamma - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\Delta G_v\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the isotropic matrix surface energy. The term $4\\pi r^2 \\gamma$ is the surface energy penalty. The second term is the bulk free energy change, where $\\Delta G_v$ is the chemical driving force per unit volume of the void. This driving force arises from the supersaturation of vacancies.\n\nThe driving force per unit volume, $\\Delta G_v$, can be expressed in terms of the chemical potential of vacancies. The change in free energy per vacancy that condenses into the void is the difference between the chemical potential of a vacancy in the supersaturated matrix, $\\mu_v$, and its chemical potential in equilibrium with a large, flat surface (the standard state), $\\mu_{v,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\nThis change is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_v = \\mu_v - \\mu_{v,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nUsing the ideal dilute solution model provided, $\\mu_v = \\mu_v^{\\circ} + k_B T \\ln C_v$, where $C_v$ is the vacancy site fraction, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\nThus,\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_v = (\\mu_v^{\\circ} + k_B T \\ln C_v) - (\\mu_v^{\\circ} + k_B T \\ln C_{v,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = k_B T \\ln \\left(\\frac{C_v}{C_{v,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio $S \\equiv C_v / C_{v,\\infty}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the vacancy supersaturation.
