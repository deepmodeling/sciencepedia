The phenomenon described is a cornerstone of dislocation theory in crystalline materials. The dissociation reaction, for example $\\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0] \\rightarrow \\frac{a}{6}[2\\bar{1}\\bar{1}] + \\frac{a}{6}[1\\bar{2}1]$, is correct for an FCC lattice on a $(111)$ slip plane. The initial dislocation is pure screw, meaning its line direction $\\vec{\\xi}$ is parallel to its Burgers vector $\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$. The resulting Shockley partials are of mixed character, specifically $30^{\\circ}$ dislocations, as the angle between their Burgers vectors and the line direction is $30^{\\circ}$. The use of isotropic elasticity is a standard and valid approximation. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe equilibrium separation $d$ is established when a balance is achieved between two forces per unit length acting on the partial dislocations: the repulsive elastic force $F_{\\text{repulsive}}/L$ and the attractive force from the stacking fault $F_{\\text{attractive}}/L$.\n\nThe stacking fault creates an energetic penalty proportional to its area. For a segment of length $L$ and width $d$, the energy is $E_{\\mathrm{SF}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}} d L$. The attractive force per unit length is the negative derivative of this energy with respect to separation:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{attractive}}}{L} = -\\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{SF}}}{\\partial d} = -\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}} $$\nThe magnitude of this constant attractive force per unit length is thus $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}}$.\n\nThe repulsive force between the two parallel straight partial dislocations must be calculated. The problem specifies the dissociation of a perfect screw dislocation. Let the total Burgers vector be $\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$ with magnitude $b$. The line direction $\\vec{\\xi}$ is parallel to $\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$. The dissociation creates two partials with Burgers vectors $\\vec{b}_{1}$ and $\\vec{b}_2$.\nThe relationship between the magnitude of the perfect dislocation's Burgers vector, $b=|\\frac{a}{2}\\langle 110 \\rangle| = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and the partial's Burgers vector, $b_p=|\\frac{a}{6}\\langle 112 \\rangle| = \\frac{a\\sqrt{6}}{6}$, is $b_p = b/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe force per unit length between two parallel dislocations separated by a distance $d$ in their slip plane is given by:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{repulsive}}}{L} = \\frac{G}{2\\pi d} \\left( b_{s1}b_{s2} + \\frac{\\vec{b}_{e1} \\cdot \\vec{b}_{e2}}{1-\\nu} \\right) $$\nwhere $b_{si}$ is the screw component of the $i$-th partial's Burgers vector and $\\vec{b}_{ei}$ is the edge component vector.\nFor the dissociation of a pure screw dislocation, the screw components of the partials are parallel and their sum equals the total Burgers vector, so $\\vec{b}_{s1}+\\vec{b}_{s2}=\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$. The edge components cancel, so $\\vec{b}_{e1}+\\vec{b}_{e2}=0$, which means $\\vec{b}_{e2} = -\\vec{b}_{e1}$. The two partials are identical in character, so $b_{s1}=b_{s2}=b_s$ and $|\\vec{b}_{e1}|=|\\vec{b}_{e2}|=b_e$.\nTherefore, $2b_s = b$, which gives $b_s=b/2$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ between the partial's Burgers vector and the line direction is $30^{\\circ}$.

The coincidence site lattice (CSL) is formed by the set of lattice points that are common to both crystal lattices, one being rotated with respect to the other. The index $\\Sigma$ is defined as the ratio of the volume of the CSL primitive cell to that of the crystal lattice primitive cell, which is equivalent to the reciprocal of the density of coincidence sites.\n\nFor a rotation in a cubic lattice, we can first determine the rotation matrix $R$. The rotation axis is specified by the vector $\\mathbf{d} = [111]$, and the normalized axis vector is $\\hat{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}}[1,1,1] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$.

The matrix $R$ is orthogonal, so $R^{-1}=R^T$.\n$$R^{-1} = R^T = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor $R^{-1}\\mathbf{x}$ to be an integer vector, the components of the matrix-vector product must be divisible by $3$:\n$$2x + 2y - z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$$\n$$-x + 2y + 2z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$$\n$$2x - y + 2z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$$\nAdding the second and third congruences gives $x + y + 4z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which simplifies to $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Adding the first and second congruences gives $x+4y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, which also simplifies to $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. All three congruences are linearly dependent and reduce to a single condition, for instance, $z \\equiv -x-y \\pmod{3}$, which is $z \\equiv 2x+2y \\pmod{3}$ as in the first congruence.\n\nThis single constraint means that for any integer choice of $x$ and $y$, only one out of three possible integer values for $z$ (modulo $3$) will satisfy the condition. Therefore, the fraction of lattice sites that are coincidence sites is $1/3$. The coincidence index $\\Sigma$ is the reciprocal of this fraction. For a primitive cubic lattice, $\\Sigma_{prim} = 3$.\n\nFor a non-primitive lattice like FCC, $\\Sigma$ must be adjusted. The rule states that if $\\Sigma_{prim}$ is odd, then $\\Sigma_{FCC} = \\Sigma_{prim}$. If $\\Sigma_{prim}$ is even, a factor of $1/2$ may be needed depending on the relationship between the CSL and the centering vectors. Since $\\Sigma_{prim} = 3$ is odd, the coincidence index for the FCC lattice is also $3$.\nThus, $\\Sigma=3$.\n\nNext, we identify the coherent twin boundary plane $(hkl)$. The problem explicitly links this $\\Sigma=3$ misorientation to coherent twin formation.\nThe energetic criterion for a coherent boundary is that its interfacial energy must be at a minimum. For a given CSL misorientation, this occurs when the boundary plane has the highest possible density of coincidence sites.\nThe geometric criterion is that the boundary is a mirror plane for the crystal structures on either side, resulting in a highly ordered interface. In FCC crystals, coherent twins form on the close-packed $\\{111\\}$ planes. This is the primary twinning system.\n\nLet us analyze the density of CSL sites on the $(111)$ plane for the $\\Sigma=3$ CSL. A point $(x,y,z)$ lies on a plane of the $(111)$ family if $x+y+z=k$ for some integer $k$. From the CSL condition derived earlier, $x+y+z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. This means that CSL points can only exist on planes $x+y+z=k$ where $k$ is a multiple of $3$.\nConsider a point on any such plane, e.g., $x+y+z=0$. The CSL condition becomes $z = -x-y$, which when substituted into one of the congruences, such as $2x+2y-z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, gives $2x+2y-(-x-y) = 3x+3y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. This is always true for any integers $x$ and $y$. This implies that every lattice point of the primitive cubic lattice on the plane $x+y+z=0$ (and on planes $x+y+z = 3k$) is a CSL point.\nTherefore, the $(111)$ plane has the highest possible density of CSL sites ($100\\%$ of the primitive lattice points on that plane). This confirms that the lowest energy, coherent twin boundary for a $\\Sigma = 3$ misorientation is the $(111)$ plane.\n\nThe Miller indices are $(hkl)=(111)$. These are primitive as their greatest common divisor is $1$.\n\nThe final result is the row matrix $[\\Sigma, h, k, l]$.\nWith $\\Sigma=3$ and $(hkl)=(111)$, the matrix is $[3, 1, 1, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2511143"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their static structure, the dynamic behavior of grain boundaries under stress governs much of a material's mechanical response, and this motion is often intrinsically coupled to shear deformation.

For each available disconnection mode $m$, calculate $\\Delta E_m$ using the current residual shear $r = s - s_{\\mathrm{pl}}$.\n      ii. Find the mode $m_{\\mathrm{best}}$ that yields the minimum $\\Delta E_m$.\n      iii. If $\\Delta E_{m_{\\mathrm{best}}} < 0$, update the state by adding one event of mode $m_{\\mathrm{best}}$:\n         $s_{\\mathrm{pl}} \\leftarrow s_{\\mathrm{pl}} + b_{\\parallel, m_{\\mathrm{best}}}$\n         $y \\leftarrow y + h_{m_{\\mathrm{best}}}$\n      iv. If no mode yields $\\Delta E_m < 0$, exit the sub-loop.\n3. After $N$ increments, compute the measured shear-coupling factor $\\beta_{\\mathrm{meas}} = s_{\\mathrm{pl}}/y$ if $y \\neq 0$, and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nAnalysis of the test cases:\nCase A: Single mode with $b_{\\parallel} = 0.25$, $h = 0.125$. The kinematic coupling factor is $\\beta_{kin} = b_{\\parallel}/h = 0.25/0.125 = 2.0$. The simulation will add events of this mode to relax the imposed shear. The final measured factor $\\beta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is expected to be very close to $2.0$.\n\nCase B: Two competing modes. Mode $0$ has $(b_{\\parallel,0}, h_0, E_{\\mathrm{c},0}) = (0.25, 0.125, 0.02)$ giving $\\beta_0=2.0$. Mode $1$ has $(b_{\\parallel,1}, h_1, E_{\\mathrm{c},1}) = (0.125, 0.25, 0.005)$ giving $\\beta_1=0.5$. Mode $1$ has a much lower core energy $E_{\\mathrm{c},1}$ and a smaller slip magnitude $b_{\\parallel,1}$. An analysis of the energy change $\\Delta E_m$ shows that for small residual shear $r$, mode $1$ becomes favorable first. The system will activate mode $1$ events, keeping $r$ low and never reaching the threshold to activate mode $0$. Thus, only mode $1$ will be active, and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ will be approximately $0.5$.\n\nCase C: Single mode with $b_{\\parallel}=0.0$. The energy change is $\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{c},0} + 0 + 0 = 0.02$. Since $\\Delta E$ is always positive, no disconnection events will ever occur. Therefore, $s_{\\mathrm{pl,tot}}=0$ and $y_{\\mathrm{tot}}=0$. As per the problem definition, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ must be $0$.\n\nCase D: Single mode with negative shear increments $\\Delta s = -0.004$ and a negative Burgers vector component $b_{\\parallel} = -0.2$. The step height $h$ is positive. This models negative shear coupling. The kinematic factor is $\\beta_{kin} = b_{\\parallel}/h = -0.2/0.1 = -2.0$. Similar to Case A, the simulation will relax the negatively accumulating shear by adding events with negative slip, resulting in $\\beta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ being close to $-2.0$.\n\nThe implementation will follow this logic precisely, providing a numerical realization of the specified model.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the simulation for all test cases and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define test cases as per the problem statement.\n    # Format: (K, N, delta_s, modes)\n    # Modes format: [(b_parallel, h, E_c), ...]\n    test_cases = [\n        (1000, 1000, 0.005, np.array([[0.25, 0.125, 0.02]])), # Case A\n        (1000, 1000, 0.005, np.array([[0.25, 0.125, 0.02], [0.125, 0.25, 0.005]])), # Case B\n        (1000, 1000, 0.005, np.array([[0.0, 0.125, 0.02]])), # Case C\n        (1000, 1000, -0.004, np.array([[-0.2, 0.1, 0.01]])), # Case D\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        K, N, delta_s, modes = case\n        beta_meas = simulate_shear_coupling(K, N, delta_s, modes)\n        results.append(beta_meas)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef simulate_shear_coupling(K, N, delta_s, modes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the discrete simulation of shear-coupled grain-boundary migration.\n\n    Args:\n        K (float): Effective stiffness.\n        N (int): Number of shear increments.\n        delta_s (float): Shear increment size.\n        modes (np.ndarray): A NumPy array where each row represents a disconnection\n                            mode as [b_parallel, h, E_c].\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The measured shear-coupling factor, beta_meas.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = 0.0  # Total imposed shear\n    s_pl = 0.0  # Total plastic slip\n    y = 0.0  # Total normal displacement\n\n    # Extract mode properties into separate vectors for efficient calculation\n    b_par_vec = modes[:, 0]\n    h_vec = modes[:, 1]\n    E_c_vec = modes[:, 2]\n\n    # Pre-calculate the constant part of the energy change equation\n    const_energy_term = E_c_vec + 0.5 * K * b_par_vec**2\n\n    # Main simulation loop over shear increments\n    for _ in range(N):\n        s += delta_s\n\n        # Inner loop for greedy energy minimization at the current shear s\n        while True:\n            # Calculate residual shear\n            r = s - s_pl\n\n            # Calculate energy change for adding one event of each mode\n            # Delta_E = E_c - K*r*b_par + 0.5*K*b_par^2\n            delta_E_vec = const_energy_term - K * r * b_par_vec\n\n            # Find the best mode to activate (most negative delta_E)\n            min_delta_E = np.min(delta_E_vec)\n            \n            if min_delta_E < 0:\n                # An energetically favorable event exists.
