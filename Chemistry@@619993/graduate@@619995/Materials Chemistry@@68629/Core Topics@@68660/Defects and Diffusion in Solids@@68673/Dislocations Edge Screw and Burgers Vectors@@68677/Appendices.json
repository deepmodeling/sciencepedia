The Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is defined by the closure failure of a Burgers circuit drawn around the dislocation and is invariant to the circuit size and shape, and the dislocation line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ is the unit tangent to the dislocation line at the point of interest. The dislocation character is defined by the angle $\\theta$ between $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$: a pure edge dislocation has $\\theta=90^\\circ$ (that is, $\\mathbf{b}\\perp \\mathbf{t}$), a pure screw dislocation has $\\theta=0^\\circ$ (that is, $\\mathbf{b}\\parallel \\mathbf{t}$), and otherwise the dislocation is mixed. Conservative glide proceeds on a slip plane that contains both $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$; for a pure screw character there is no unique glide plane because any plane containing $\\mathbf{b}$ also contains $\\mathbf{t}$.\n\nIn the present case, the line direction is along $\\hat{z}$, so $\\mathbf{t}=\\hat{z}$, and the Burgers vector is $\\mathbf{b}=b\\,\\hat{x}$ with $b>0$.

The slip direction is, by definition, the direction of the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_{e}$.\nThe given Burgers vector for the edge dislocation is $\\mathbf{b}_{e} = b_{0}\\,(0,1,0)$, where $b_{0} > 0$.

The normal to this plane, $\\mathbf{n}_{e}$, must be orthogonal to both vectors. We can compute this normal using the cross product of the direction vectors. The given line direction is $\\mathbf{t}_{e} = (1,0,0)$, which is a unit vector. The unit vector in the direction of the Burgers vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_{e}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{n}_{e} = \\mathbf{t}_{e} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_{e} = (1,0,0) \\times (0,1,0) $$\nWe compute the cross product:\n$$ \\mathbf{n}_{e} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{x} & \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{y} & \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = (0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 1)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{x} - (1 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{y} + (1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{z} = (0,0,1) $$\nThe resulting vector $\\mathbf{n}_{e} = (0,0,1)$ is a unit vector, as $|\\mathbf{n}_{e}| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = 1$.\n\nPart 2: Screw Dislocation\nNext, we determine the unit slip direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}_{s}$ for the screw dislocation and verify the consistency of its given glide plane normal $\\mathbf{n}_{s}$.\nThe Burgers vector is $\\mathbf{b}_{s} = b_{1}\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,1,0)$, with $b_{1} > 0$.

The glide plane must contain the dislocation line, meaning the line direction vector $\\mathbf{t}_{s}$ must be orthogonal to the plane's normal $\\mathbf{n}_{s}$. The problem provides $\\mathbf{n}_{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(1,-1,2)$ and asks for verification of its consistency by checking orthogonality to both $\\mathbf{t}_{s}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{s}$. Since $\\mathbf{t}_{s}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{s}$ are parallel, checking orthogonality for one is sufficient. We perform the dot product:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}_{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{s} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,1,0)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(1,-1,2)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (-1) + 0 \\cdot 2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}(1 - 1 + 0) = 0 $$\nThe orthogonality condition is satisfied.

The motion of a dislocation can be conservative (glide) or non-conservative (climb).\n\n$1$. **Glide (Conservative Motion):** Glide is the motion of a dislocation line within its glide plane. A plane is a valid glide plane if and only if it contains both the dislocation line vector $\\mathbf{t}$ and the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$. The problem specifies a process \"without absorption or emission of point defects,\" which by definition is conservative motion.\n\n$2$. **Climb (Non-Conservative Motion):** Climb is the motion of a dislocation out of its glide plane. This process requires the diffusion of point defects (vacancies or interstitials) to or from the dislocation line and is thus non-conservative and thermally activated.\n\n$3$. **Geometric Constraints on Glide for Different Dislocation Characters:**\n    *   **Edge Dislocation:** By definition, the line vector is perpendicular to the Burgers vector: $\\mathbf{t} \\perp \\mathbf{b}$. These two orthogonal vectors uniquely define a single plane, the glide plane. Therefore, an edge dislocation is constrained to move only on this one plane. Any motion out of this plane is climb.\n    *   **Screw Dislocation:** By definition, the line vector is parallel to the Burgers vector: $\\mathbf{t} \\parallel \\mathbf{b}$. Since the two vectors are collinear, any plane that contains the dislocation line $\\mathbf{t}$ automatically contains the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$. Consequently, a screw dislocation is not confined to a single glide plane; it has the geometric freedom to glide on any plane belonging to the zone of its Burgers vector.\n\n$4$. **Cross-Slip:** Cross-slip is the mechanism by which a screw dislocation changes its glide plane from one valid plane to another intersecting plane that also contains the Burgers vector. This is a form of glide and is therefore a conservative process. Because only screw dislocations possess multiple potential glide planes, only screw segments of a dislocation line can cross-slip.\n\n$5$. **Mechanism in FCC Metals:** In face-centered cubic (FCC) crystals, the primary slip system is $\\{111\\}\\langle 110 \\rangle$. A perfect dislocation with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}\\langle 110 \\rangle$ often dissociates, especially in materials with low stacking fault energy (SFE), into two Shockley partial dislocations on a $\\{111\\}$ plane, separated by a ribbon of stacking fault. For example:\n$$ \\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0] \\rightarrow \\frac{a}{6}[2\\bar{1}\\bar{1}] + \\frac{a}{6}[1\\bar{2}1] $$\nThis extended dislocation is planar and confined to its original $\\{111\\}$ glide plane. For cross-slip to occur (e.g., from the $(111)$ plane to the $(11\\bar{1})$ plane, which both contain the $[1\\bar{1}0]$ screw dislocation direction), the dissociated partials must first recombine locally to form a short segment of a perfect screw dislocation. This is known as **constriction**. This constricted segment is no longer planar and is free to move onto the intersecting cross-slip plane, where it can then re-dissociate. This entire process (constriction and re-dissociation) is the accepted mechanism for cross-slip in low-SFE FCC metals.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Cross-slip is a conservative transfer of a dislocation from one glide plane to a symmetrically equivalent glide plane that also contains the same Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$; only screw segments can cross-slip because $\\mathbf{t}\\parallel\\mathbf{b}$ for a screw, so there exist multiple planes that simultaneously contain the line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, and in FCC the process proceeds by local constriction and redissociation.**\nThis statement is flawlessly correct. It accurately defines cross-slip as a conservative process on a valid alternate glide plane. It correctly identifies the fundamental geometric reason ($\\mathbf{t} \\parallel \\mathbf{b}$) why only screw dislocations can cross-slip. Finally, it correctly adds the specific mechanism (constriction/redissociation) relevant to the FCC structure mentioned in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Cross-slip is a nonconservative, climb-assisted motion between any two planes; both edge and screw segments can cross-slip if vacancy supersaturation is sufficiently high.**\nThis statement fundamentally misrepresents the process. Cross-slip is by definition conservative. The process described is climb, not cross-slip. The claim that edge segments can cross-slip is also incorrect. This option directly contradicts the foundational principles of dislocation motion and the problem's constraint of a conservative process.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In FCC crystals, a perfect dislocation $\\mathbf{b}=\\dfrac{a}{2}\\langle 110\\rangle$ dissociates on a $\\{111\\}$ plane into two Shockley partials $\\dfrac{a}{6}\\langle 112\\rangle$ separated by a stacking fault; cross-slip requires local recombination (constriction) of the partials to recover a perfect screw segment, after which redissociation can occur on an intersecting $\\{111\\}$ plane sharing a $\\langle 110\\rangle$ direction with the original plane, which is why only screw segments cross-slip.**\nThis statement provides a correct and detailed description of the cross-slip mechanism for extended dislocations in FCC crystals. The dissociation reaction, the need for constriction into a perfect screw segment, and subsequent redissociation on the new plane are all accurate. The final clause, \"...which is why only screw segments cross-slip,\" is logically sound because the described mechanism is only viable for a screw segment, which has the inherent geometric ability to change glide planes once it is no longer bound by a planar stacking fault. This statement correctly explains the *how* for the specific case given in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Edge segments cannot cross-slip because their Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line ($\\mathbf{t}\\perp\\mathbf{b}$); the plane spanned by $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is then unique, so moving to any other plane requires motion normal to the glide plane (climb), which is not cross-slip.**\nThis statement correctly explains the contrapositive case: why edge dislocations *cannot* cross-slip. It correctly identifies the geometric constraint ($\\mathbf{t} \\perp \\mathbf{b}$) that defines a unique glide plane for an edge dislocation. It correctly concludes that any motion off this plane must be climb, which is a different, non-conservative mechanism. This is a critical part of the full explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Cross-slip is possible for mixed dislocations of any character if the Schmid factor is maximized on the cross plane; the character of the segment does not matter because $\\mathbf{b}$ is invariant.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A mixed dislocation has both an edge component and a screw component. The edge component is confined to a single glide plane. Therefore, the entire mixed dislocation cannot change its glide plane conservatively. The claim that character does not matter is false; the character (relative orientation of $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$) is the determining factor. The invariance of $\\mathbf{b}$ is irrelevant to this specific constraint.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2481679"}]}
