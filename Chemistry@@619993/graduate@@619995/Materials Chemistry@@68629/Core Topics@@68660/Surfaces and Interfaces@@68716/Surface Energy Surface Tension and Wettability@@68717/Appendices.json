The liquid has liquid–vapor surface tension $\\gamma$ at the measurement temperature, and dynamic contact angle measurements on this solid yield an advancing contact angle $\\theta_{A}$ and a receding contact angle $\\theta_{R}$, both measured through the liquid. Assume that the motion is sufficiently slow that inertial effects are negligible and the only relevant dissipation and resistance arise from contact line pinning associated with surface heterogeneity. The contact line remains straight over the region of interest so that curvature effects can be neglected, and gravity-induced shape distortions can be ignored over the small translation distances considered.\n\nStarting from the definitions of interfacial free energies and the mechanical force balance at a three-phase contact line, and invoking Young’s equation for the equilibrium contact angle on a homogeneous surface, derive from first principles a closed-form expression for the maximum per-unit-length capillary pinning force resisting the translation of the contact line in terms of $\\gamma$, $\\theta_{A}$, and $\\theta_{R}$.

The derivation must be based on first principles, including interfacial energies, the mechanical force balance at a three-phase contact line, and Young's equation.\n\nLet us begin by considering the forces acting at the three-phase contact line, where the solid, liquid, and vapor phases meet. The interfacial tensions, which are free energies per unit area, are denoted as $\\gamma_{sl}$ for the solid-liquid interface, $\\gamma_{sv}$ for the solid-vapor interface, and $\\gamma$ for the liquid-vapor interface. These tensions give rise to forces per unit length acting on the contact line.\n\nConsider a straight contact line oriented perpendicular to the direction of translation, which we define as the $x$-axis. The force balance in the plane of the substrate involves the horizontal component of the liquid-vapor tension and the net force from the solid-phase tensions. The force per unit length exerted by the liquid-vapor interface on the contact line, parallel to the substrate, is given by $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the contact angle measured through the liquid. This force component acts in the direction of the bulk liquid. The solid surface exerts a net force per unit length, $(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl})$, which is often called the adhesion tension. This force acts in the direction of the vapor phase, pulling the liquid back.\n\nOn an ideal, perfectly homogeneous, and smooth solid surface, the system reaches a unique thermodynamic equilibrium state. At equilibrium, the net horizontal force on the contact line is zero. This leads to Young's equation, which relates the equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta_Y$, to the interfacial tensions:\n$$\n\\gamma \\cos\\theta_Y = \\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma_{sv}$ and $\\gamma_{sl}$ are constant across the entire surface.\n\nOn a chemically heterogeneous surface, as described in the problem, the values of $\\gamma_{sv}$ and $\\gamma_{sl}$ are not constant but vary with position $x$ on the surface. Consequently, the local adhesion tension, $(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))$, also varies. This spatial variation is the fundamental cause of contact line pinning and contact angle hysteresis. A stationary contact line can exist for a continuous range of macroscopic contact angles, from a receding angle $\\theta_R$ to an advancing angle $\\theta_A$, without any net motion.\n\nThe condition for a stationary contact line at a position $x$ is that the local forces are balanced. The observed macroscopic contact angle $\\theta$ adjusts to satisfy the local equilibrium condition:\n$$\n\\gamma \\cos\\theta = \\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x)\n$$\nThe contact line remains pinned as long as the surface can provide a local adhesion tension that balances the capillary force $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe advancing contact angle, $\\theta_A$, is the maximum possible angle before the contact line begins to advance (i.e., the liquid front moves onto a previously dry area). This occurs when the driving force from the liquid is just sufficient to overcome the point of greatest resistance to wetting. The resistance to advancing is greatest at locations that are least wettable, which correspond to the minimum value of the adhesion tension, $\\min_x(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))$. Thus, at the threshold of advancing:\n$$\n\\gamma \\cos\\theta_A = \\min_x(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))\n$$\n\nThe receding contact angle, $\\theta_R$, is the minimum possible angle before the contact line begins to recede (i.e., the liquid front withdraws from a previously wetted area). This occurs when the external pulling force overcomes the strongest pinning point that holds the liquid to the surface. These pinning points are the most wettable locations, which correspond to the maximum value of the adhesion tension, $\\max_x(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))$. Thus, at the threshold of receding:\n$$\n\\gamma \\cos\\theta_R = \\max_x(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"maximum per-unit-length capillary pinning force resisting the translation,\" which we denote as $f_p$. This force represents the maximum possible restoring force that the surface heterogeneity can exert to oppose the motion of the contact line. This force is equivalent to the total range of variation in the adhesion tension that the heterogeneous surface can provide. Therefore, we can express $f_p$ as the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of the adhesion tension:\n$$\nf_p = \\max_x(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x)) - \\min_x(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the advancing and receding thresholds into this equation yields the desired expression for the maximum pinning force:\n$$\nf_p = \\gamma \\cos\\theta_R - \\gamma \\cos\\theta_A\n$$\nFactoring out the liquid-vapor surface tension $\\gamma$, we obtain the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nf_p = \\gamma (\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)\n$$\nThis expression is a standard result for the hysteretic force or pinning force on a heterogeneous surface. Since for any hysteretic system $\\theta_A > \\theta_R$, and for typical contact angles ($0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$), $\\cos\\theta$ is a decreasing function of $\\theta$, it follows that $\\cos\\theta_R > \\cos\\theta_A$, ensuring that $f_p$ is a positive quantity.\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value of this force using the provided data:\n- Liquid-vapor surface tension, $\\gamma = 0.0720 \\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n- Advancing contact angle, $\\theta_A = 112.0^{\\circ}$\n- Receding contact angle, $\\theta_R = 96.0^{\\circ}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula.
