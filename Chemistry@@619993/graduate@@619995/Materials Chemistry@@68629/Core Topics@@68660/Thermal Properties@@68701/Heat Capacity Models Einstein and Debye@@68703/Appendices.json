It is a standard problem in solid-state physics concerning lattice dynamics and its influence on thermodynamic properties. All required information is provided, and the given physical parameters are realistic. We will proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the mass-scaling of phonon frequencies.\n\nWe begin with the harmonic approximation for a crystalline elemental solid. The potential energy $U$ of the lattice is a quadratic function of the atomic displacements $u_{l\\alpha}$ from their equilibrium positions $\\mathbf{R}_{l\\alpha}$, where $l$ indexes the unit cell and $\\alpha$ indexes the atom within the basis. For an elemental solid with a Bravais lattice (one atom per unit cell), we can simplify the notation and denote the displacement of the atom at equilibrium position $\\mathbf{R}_n$ as $\\mathbf{u}_n(t)$. The equation of motion for this atom, derived from Newton's second law and the harmonic potential, is:\n$$ M \\frac{d^2 u_{n\\alpha}}{dt^2} = - \\sum_{n',\\beta} \\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(n, n') u_{n'\\beta} $$\nHere, $M$ is the mass of the atom, $u_{n\\alpha}$ is the displacement of the atom in cell $n$ along the Cartesian direction $\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$, and $\\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(n, n')$ is the interatomic force-constant tensor, which describes the force in direction $\\alpha$ on the atom at site $n$ due to a unit displacement in direction $\\beta$ of the atom at site $n'$. Due to the translational symmetry of the crystal, the force constants depend only on the relative position of the two sites, i.e., $\\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(n, n') = \\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{R}_n - \\mathbf{R}_{n'})$.\n\nWe assume a plane-wave solution, representing a normal mode (phonon) of the lattice, of the form:\n$$ u_{n\\alpha}(t) = \\epsilon_\\alpha(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_n - \\omega t)] $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\epsilon_\\alpha(\\mathbf{k})$ is the component of the polarization vector in the $\\alpha$ direction. Substituting this ansatz into the equation of motion yields:\n$$ -M \\omega^2 \\epsilon_\\alpha(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_n - \\omega t)] = - \\sum_{n',\\beta} \\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{R}_n, \\mathbf{R}_{n'}) \\epsilon_\\beta(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp[i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_{n'} - \\omega t)] $$\nWe can cancel the term $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ from both sides and factor out $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_n)$:\n$$ M \\omega^2 \\epsilon_\\alpha(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{\\beta} \\left( \\sum_{n'} \\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{R}_n - \\mathbf{R}_{n'}) \\exp[i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{R}_{n'} - \\mathbf{R}_n)] \\right) \\epsilon_\\beta(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nThe term in the parentheses is defined as the dynamical matrix, $D_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$ D_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{m} \\Phi_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{R}_m) \\exp[-i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_m] $$\nwhere the sum is over all lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}_m = \\mathbf{R}_n - \\mathbf{R}_{n'}$. The dynamical matrix $D(\\mathbf{k})$ depends on the crystal structure and the interatomic force constants, but it is independent of the atomic mass $M$. The equation of motion simplifies to an eigenvalue problem:\n$$ \\omega^2 M \\epsilon_\\alpha(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{\\beta} D_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf{k}) \\epsilon_\\beta(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nFor each wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$, the solutions for $\\omega^2$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $M^{-1}D(\\mathbf{k})$. If $\\lambda_j(\\mathbf{k})$ are the eigenvalues of $D(\\mathbf{k})$ (for $j=1,2,3$ in a 3D Bravais lattice), then the corresponding phonon frequencies $\\omega_j(\\mathbf{k})$ are given by:\n$$ \\omega_j^2(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\lambda_j(\\mathbf{k})}{M} $$\nThe problem states that isotopic substitution does not alter the bonding environment, meaning the force constants $\\Phi$ and thus the dynamical matrix $D(\\mathbf{k})$ remain unchanged. Consequently, from the equation above, it is clear that the square of any phonon frequency is inversely proportional to the atomic mass:\n$$ \\omega^2 \\propto M^{-1} $$\nTaking the square root, we arrive at the required mass-scaling relationship for all phonon frequencies:\n$$ \\omega \\propto M^{-1/2} $$\n\nPart 2: Deduction of the scaling of Debye and Einstein temperatures.\n\nThe Einstein and Debye temperatures are defined in terms of characteristic phonon frequencies.\nThe Einstein temperature, $\\Theta_E$, is defined by a single characteristic frequency, $\\omega_E$, typically representing an optical phonon mode:\n$$ \\Theta_E = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B} $$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Since $\\omega_E$ is a phonon frequency, it scales as $\\omega_E \\propto M^{-1/2}$. Therefore, the Einstein temperature must scale in the same way:\n$$ \\Theta_E \\propto M^{-1/2} $$\nThe Debye temperature, $\\Theta_D$, is defined by the Debye frequency, $\\omega_D$, which acts as a cutoff frequency for the phonon spectrum in the Debye model:\n$$ \\Theta_D = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_D}{k_B} $$\nThe Debye frequency is determined by normalizing the total number of vibrational modes. It is related to the speed of sound, $v_s$, and the number density of atoms, $N/V$. The speed of sound is the slope of the acoustic phonon dispersion curve near $\\mathbf{k}=0$, $v_s = \\lim_{k\\to 0} (\\omega(\\mathbf{k})/k)$. Since all phonon frequencies $\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$ scale as $M^{-1/2}$, the sound speed also scales as $v_s \\propto M^{-1/2}$. As the Debye cutoff frequency $\\omega_D$ is proportional to the sound speed (e.g., $\\omega_D = v_s (6\\pi^2 N/V)^{1/3}$ in an isotropic model), it also scales with mass as:\n$$ \\omega_D \\propto M^{-1/2} $$\nConsequently, the Debye temperature also follows the same scaling law:\n$$ \\Theta_D \\propto M^{-1/2} $$\nTherefore, for a change of isotopic mass from $M_0$ to $M_1$, the transformation for both characteristic temperatures ($\\Theta = \\Theta_E$ or $\\Theta = \\Theta_D$) is given by the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Theta_1}{\\Theta_0} = \\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_0}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_0}{M_1}} $$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of new Debye and Einstein temperatures.\n\nWe are given the initial and final atomic masses and the initial characteristic temperatures:\nInitial mass, $M_0 = 28$ u.\nFinal mass, $M_1 = 30$ u.\nInitial Debye temperature, $\\Theta_{D,0} = 645$ K.\nInitial Einstein temperature, $\\Theta_{E,0} = 748$ K.\n\nUsing the scaling law derived in Part 2, we can calculate the new temperatures $\\Theta_{D,1}$ and $\\Theta_{E,1}$.\nFirst, we compute the scaling factor:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{M_0}{M_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{28}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{14}{15}} \\approx 0.96609178 $$\nNow, we apply this factor to the initial temperatures.\nFor the new Debye temperature, $\\Theta_{D,1}$:\n$$ \\Theta_{D,1} = \\Theta_{D,0} \\sqrt{\\frac{M_0}{M_1}} = 645 \\, \\text{K} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{28}{30}} \\approx 645 \\times 0.96609178 \\, \\text{K} \\approx 623.1292 \\, \\text{K} $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $\\Theta_{D,1} = 623.1$ K.\n\nFor the new Einstein temperature, $\\Theta_{E,1}$:\n$$ \\Theta_{E,1} = \\Theta_{E,0} \\sqrt{\\frac{M_0}{M_1}} = 748 \\, \\text{K} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{28}{30}} \\approx 748 \\times 0.96609178 \\, \\text{K} \\approx 722.6366 \\, \\text{K} $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $\\Theta_{E,1} = 722.6$ K.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n623.1  722.6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2489313"}, {"introduction": "The Debye model provides a more accurate picture of lattice vibrations by introducing a continuous spectrum of phonon frequencies up to a cutoff, correcting the primary deficiency of the Einstein model.

We perform an integration by parts on the integral $\\int_0^y \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx$:\n$$ \\int_0^y \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx = \\left[\\frac{x^4}{4(e^x-1)}\\right]_0^y - \\int_0^y \\frac{x^4}{4} \\left(-\\frac{e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}\\right)dx = \\frac{y^4}{4(e^y-1)} + \\frac{1}{4}\\int_0^y \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C_V$:\n$$ C_V = 9N k_B \\left[ 4y^{-3} \\left( \\frac{y^4}{4(e^y-1)} + \\frac{1}{4}\\int_0^y \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx \\right) - \\frac{y}{e^y-1} \\right] $$\n$$ C_V = 9N k_B \\left( \\frac{y}{e^y-1} + y^{-3}\\int_0^y \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx - \\frac{y}{e^y-1} \\right) = 9N k_B y^{-3} \\int_0^y \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx $$\nFor one mole, $N=N_A$ and $R=N_A k_B$. Substituting back $y=\\Theta_D/T = 1/r$:\n$$ C_{V,m} = 9R \\left(\\frac{T}{\\Theta_D}\\right)^3 \\int_0^{\\Theta_D/T} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx $$\nNormalizing by the Dulong-Petit limit of $3R$, we arrive at the required dimensionless expression:\n$$ \\frac{C_V}{3R} = 3r^3 \\int_0^{1/r} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nTo evaluate this expression numerically, we employ direct quadrature. The integrand $f(x) = \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}$ is well-behaved. Its limit as $x \\to 0$ is $\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{x^4(1+...)}{(x+x^2/2+...)^2} = \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{x^4}{x^2}=0$. The integrand is non-singular. However, a naive implementation might encounter a `0/0` error at $x=0$. A robust method must handle this by defining the integrand value as $0$ at $x=0$. For small $x$, the term $e^x-1$ should be computed using a function like `numpy.expm1(x)` to avoid loss of precision. The integral is computed using a standard adaptive quadrature algorithm, for which `scipy.integrate.quad` is an excellent choice, providing high accuracy.\n\nAnalysis of the limiting behaviors reveals key physical insights.\nFor high temperatures, $T \\gg \\Theta_D$, we have $r \\gg 1$ and the integration limit $1/r \\to 0$. For small $x$, the integrand $f(x) \\approx x^2$.\n$$ \\frac{C_V}{3R} \\approx 3r^3 \\int_0^{1/r} x^2 dx = 3r^3 \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^{1/r} = 3r^3 \\frac{(1/r)^3}{3} = 1 $$\nThus, $C_V \\to 3R$, recovering the classical Dulong-Petit law as expected.\n\nFor low temperatures, $T \\ll \\Theta_D$, we have $r \\ll 1$ and the integration limit $1/r \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\frac{C_V}{3R} \\approx 3r^3 \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx $$\nThe definite integral evaluates to a constant: $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2}dx = 4\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx = 4\\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 4(6)(\\frac{\\pi^4}{90}) = \\frac{4\\pi^4}{15}$.\nThe normalized heat capacity becomes:\n$$ \\frac{C_V}{3R} \\approx 3r^3 \\left( \\frac{4\\pi^4}{15} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^4}{5} r^3 $$\nThis demonstrates the famous Debye $T^3$ law, $C_V \\propto T^3$, which is a signature of the 3D phonon gas at low temperatures. The leading-order scaling law in $r$ is cubic.\n\nThe numerical computation for the test suite $r = \\{0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0\\}$ yields the following values for $C_V/(3R)$, rounded to six decimal places:\nFor $r=0.1$: $0.077755$\nFor $r=0.5$: $0.769532$\nFor $r=1.0$: $0.951717$\nFor $r=2.0$: $0.987748$\nThese results are consistent with the derived limits. The value at $r=0.1$ is close to the low-temperature approximation $\\frac{4\\pi^4}{5}(0.1)^3 \\approx 0.077927$. The value at $r=2.0$ is approaching the Dulong-Petit limit of $1$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the normalized molar heat capacity in the Debye model for a\n    given set of dimensionless temperatures r = T/Theta_D.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]\n\n    def integrand(x):\n        \"\"\"\n        The integrand for the Debye heat capacity integral.\n        f(x) = x^4 * e^x / (e^x - 1)^2\n        \"\"\"\n        # The limit of the integrand as x - 0 is 0.\n        # We handle x=0 explicitly to avoid a 0/0 floating point error.\n        if np.isclose(x, 0.0):\n            return 0.0\n        \n        # np.expm1(x) calculates e^x - 1 with high precision for small x.\n        denominator = np.expm1(x)\n        \n        # This check is for robustness, in case the denominator is zero for\n        # non-zero x due to precision limits, though highly unlikely here.\n        if np.isclose(denominator, 0.0):\n            return 0.0\n\n        return (x**4 * np.exp(x)) / (denominator**2)\n\n    results = []\n    for r in test_cases:\n        # The upper limit of integration is 1/r.\n        upper_limit = 1.0 / r\n\n        # Perform numerical integration using SciPy's quad function.\n        # quad returns the integral value and an estimated error.\n        integral_val, _ = quad(integrand, 0, upper_limit)\n\n        # The normalized heat capacity is C_V/(3R) = 3*r^3 * Integral.\n        cv_normalized = 3 * (r**3) * integral_val\n        \n        # Round the result to exactly 6 decimal places as required.\n        results.append(round(cv_normalized, 6))\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The output should be a single line, e.g., \"[x1,x2,x3,x4]\"\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2489271"}]}
