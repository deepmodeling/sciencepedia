It is based on fundamental principles and presents a complete set of idealized data, which is appropriate for a pedagogical context. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe general procedure for indexing a powder diffraction pattern from a material of unknown structure, especially one with high crystal symmetry as is often assumed in such problems, follows a sequence of logical steps. While modern algorithms are highly sophisticated and often employ exhaustive search strategies, the core logic is based on the principles outlined below.\n\nFirst, the measured interplanar spacings $d_{hkl}$, which are in real space, must be converted to a reciprocal space quantity. This is because the relationship between reflections is simpler in reciprocal space. Bragg's law, $2 d \\sin \\theta = \\lambda$, can be squared and rearranged. Using the definition of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, $Q_{hkl} = 1/d_{hkl} = (2 \\sin \\theta)/\\lambda$, we obtain a quantity $Q_{hkl}^2 = 1/d_{hkl}^2$. The expression for $Q_{hkl}^2$ is a quadratic form in the Miller indices $(h, k, l)$ and the reciprocal lattice parameters. For the general triclinic case, this is $Q_{hkl}^2 = h^2 a^{*2} + k^2 b^{*2} + l^2 c^{*2} + 2hk a^* b^* \\cos \\gamma^* + 2hl a^* c^* \\cos \\beta^* + 2kl b^* c^* \\cos \\alpha^*$. For higher symmetry systems, this equation simplifies significantly. For a cubic system, it becomes $Q_{hkl}^2 = (h^2+k^2+l^2)/a^2$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.\n\nSecond, one attempts to discriminate among Bravais lattices. This is achieved by searching for simple rational relationships between the observed $Q_i^2$ values. For a cubic lattice, the ratios of $Q_i^2$ values must be ratios of integers, where these integers are sums of three squares, $N = h^2+k^2+l^2$. Furthermore, systematic absences in the set of observed reflections impose constraints on the allowed $(hkl)$ indices, which are characteristic of the Bravais lattice type. For a primitive cubic (P) lattice, all integer values of $N$ that can be written as the sum of three squares are allowed (e.g., $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, ...$; $7, 15, 23, 28, ...$ are forbidden). For a body-centered cubic (I) lattice, the reflection condition is $h+k+l = 2n$ (even), which means $h^2+k^2+l^2$ must be an even integer (e.g., $N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...$). For a face-centered cubic (F) lattice, the indices must be all even or all odd, leading to an allowed sequence of $N = 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 16, ...$. By identifying the sequence of multipliers that relates the observed $Q_i^2$ values, one can deduce the crystal system and Bravais lattice.\n\nThird, a candidate unit cell is proposed. For a cubic system, once the Bravais lattice is identified, any single reflection can be used to propose a trial lattice parameter. For example, if the first peak is indexed as $(h_1k_1l_1)$, then $a^2 = (h_1^2+k_1^2+l_1^2)/Q_1^2$.\n\nFourth, the proposed unit cell must be verified by consistently assigning Miller indices to all observed peaks. The calculated $Q_{calc}^2$ values for the indexed peaks must match the observed $Q_{obs}^2$ values within the experimental uncertainty. For a successful indexing, all observed lines must be accounted for without any un-indexed lines at low angle, and the indices must satisfy the systematic absence rules for the proposed Bravais lattice.\n\nFifth, once a valid indexing solution is found, the lattice parameter(s) are refined using a least-squares method. This procedure minimizes the sum of the weighted squared differences between the observed and calculated peak positions. For a cubic system with model $Q_i^2 = N_i/a^2$, and a parameter to fit $P = 1/a^2$, the function to minimize is $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i w_i (Q_{i,obs}^2 - N_i P)^2$, where $w_i$ are statistical weights, typically related to the inverse square of the uncertainty of each observation.\n\nApplying this procedure to the provided data:\n\nStep 1: The twenty given $d$-spacings are converted to $Q_i^2 = 1/d_i^2$ values (in units of Å$^{-2}$).\n$Q_1^2 = 1/(2.121320)^2 = 0.22222223$\n$Q_2^2 = 1/(1.500000)^2 = 0.44444444$\n$Q_3^2 = 1/(1.224745)^2 = 0.66666667$\n$Q_4^2 = 1/(1.060660)^2 = 0.88888889$\nand so on.\n\nStep 2: We examine the ratios of these $Q^2$ values. Let $S = Q_1^2 = 0.22222223$.\n$Q_2^2/S = 2.0000000$\n$Q_3^2/S = 3.0000000$\n$Q_4^2/S = 4.0000000$\nThis suggests that the $Q^2$ values might be integer multiples of some fundamental value. Let's find this fundamental value by dividing each $Q_i^2$ by small integers until a consistent constant emerges. We observe that $Q_1^2/2 = 0.11111111$, $Q_2^2/4 = 0.11111111$, $Q_3^2/6 = 0.11111111$, etc. A common factor $C_0 = 1/9 \\approx 0.11111111$ Å$^{-2}$ is evident. The observed $Q_i^2$ values are thus $Q_i^2 = N_i \\cdot C_0$, where the sequence of integers $N_i$ is:\n$N_1 = 2$, $N_2 = 4$, $N_3 = 6$, $N_4 = 8$, $N_5 = 10$, $N_6 = 12$, $N_7 = 14$, $N_8 = 16$, $N_9 = 18$, $N_{10} = 20$, $N_{11} = 22$, $N_{12} = 24$, $N_{13} = 26$.\nContinuing for all 20 peaks, we find the sequence of $N$ values to be: $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42$.\nThis sequence consists of all even numbers from $2$ to $26$, skips $28$, and continues from $30$. The integer $28$ cannot be written as the sum of three integer squares. This sequence is the unique signature of a body-centered cubic (BCC or I) lattice.\n\nStep 3: The crystal system is cubic and the Bravais lattice is body-centered. The relation for $Q^2$ is an special case: $Q_{hkl}^2 = (h^2+k^2+l^2)/a^2$. The constant factor we found is $C_0 = 1/a^2$. From our analysis, $C_0 \\approx 1/9$ Å$^{-2}$, which gives a trial lattice parameter $a = \\sqrt{9} = 3$ Å.\n\nStep 4: We assign Miller indices $(hkl)$ consistent with the BCC selection rule ($h+k+l = \\text{even}$) for each observed peak.\n- $d_1, N=2: (110)$\n- $d_2, N=4: (200)$\n- $d_3, N=6: (211)$\n- $d_4, N=8: (220)$\n- $d_5, N=10: (310)$\n- $d_6, N=12: (222)$\n- $d_7, N=14: (321)$\n- $d_8, N=16: (400)$\n- $d_9, N=18: (330)$ or $(411)$\n- $d_{10}, N=20: (420)$\n- $d_{11}, N=22: (332)$\n- $d_{12}, N=24: (422)$\n- $d_{13}, N=26: (510)$ or $(431)$\n- $d_{14}, N=30: (521)$\n- $d_{15}, N=32: (440)$\n- $d_{16}, N=34: (530)$ or $(433)$\n- $d_{17}, N=36: (600)$ or $(442)$\n- $d_{18}, N=38: (611)$ or $(532)$\n- $d_{19}, N=40: (620)$\n- $d_{20}, N=42: (541)$\nAll twenty peaks are indexed, and the pattern is perfectly consistent with a BCC lattice.\n\nStep 5: A least-squares refinement is performed to obtain the best value for the lattice parameter $a$. The model is $Q_i^2 = P \\cdot N_i$ where $P = 1/a^2$. A statistically sound approach involves weighting each data point by the inverse of its variance. The uncertainty in $Q^2$ is $\\delta(Q_i^2) = 2 Q_i^2 (\\delta d_i/d_i)$. Since $\\delta d/d$ is constant, the standard deviation $\\sigma_i$ for $Q_i^2$ is proportional to $Q_i^2$. The weight is $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2 \\propto 1/(Q_i^2)^2$. Using $Q_i^2 \\approx P N_i$, the weights are $w_i \\propto 1/N_i^2$. The weighted least-squares solution for the slope $P$ of a line passing through the origin is $P = (\\sum w_i N_i Q_i^2) / (\\sum w_i N_i^2)$. Substituting $w_i = 1/N_i^2$ simplifies this to $P = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{Q_i^2}{N_i}$, where $n = 20$.\nWe compute the value of $Q_i^2/N_i = 1/(d_i^2 N_i)$ for each peak:\n$1/(2.121320^2 \\times 2) = 0.111111115$\n$1/(1.500000^2 \\times 4) = 0.111111111$\n...\n$1/(0.4629100^2 \\times 42) = 0.111111111$\nThe individual values are all extremely close to $1/9$. Averaging the twenty values:\n$P = \\frac{1}{20} \\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\frac{1}{d_i^2 N_i} = 0.11111111105$ Å$^{-2}$.\nThe refined lattice parameter $a$ is then calculated from $a = 1/\\sqrt{P}$.\n$a = 1/\\sqrt{0.11111111105} = 3.00000000075$ Å.\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $a = 3.000$ Å.\nThe unit-cell volume for a cubic lattice is $V = a^3$.\n$V = (3.00000000075 \\text{ Å})^3 = 27.00000000675$ Å$^3$.\nRounding to four significant figures, the volume is $V = 27.00$ Å$^3$.\nThe determined lattice is body-centered cubic with $a = 3.000$ Å.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.000 & 27.00 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2515451"}, {"introduction": "While powder diffraction averages information over all crystal orientations, single-crystal diffraction provides the highest-resolution structural details.

All necessary information for a quantitative evaluation is provided. The problem is valid.\n\nWe will now analyze the criteria for a successful data collection strategy and evaluate each option.\n\n**1. Detector Distance ($L$) and Resolution ($d_{\\min}$)**\n\nThe relationship between d-spacing ($d$) and scattering angle ($2\\theta$) is given by Bragg's law:\n$$ \\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta $$\nFor the minimum d-spacing $d_{\\min} = 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$, the maximum required scattering angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ is:\n$$ \\sin\\theta_{\\max} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2d_{\\min}} = \\frac{0.71073\\,\\text{\\AA}}{2 \\times 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA}} = 0.355365 $$\n$$ \\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin(0.355365) \\approx 20.81^\\circ $$\nThe full scattering angle is $2\\theta_{\\max} \\approx 41.62^\\circ$.\n\nTo capture reflections at this angle, they must fall within the active area of the detector. The detector is a $300\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ square. The maximum distance from the center (direct beam) to a point on the detector is to its corner. This distance, $R_{\\max}$, is:\n$$ R_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{300}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{300}{2}\\right)^2} = 150\\sqrt{2} \\approx 212.1\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe relationship between sample-to-detector distance $L$, detector radius $R$, and scattering angle $2\\theta$ is:\n$$ \\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{R}{L} $$\nTo record data to $d_{\\min} = 1.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$, the detector must be positioned at a distance $L$ such that the $2\\theta_{\\max}$ reflections are captured, i.e., $L \\tan(2\\theta_{\\max}) \\le R_{\\max}$. This sets a maximum permissible distance $L_{\\max}$:\n$$ L_{\\max} = \\frac{R_{\\max}}{\\tan(2\\theta_{\\max})} = \\frac{212.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{\\tan(41.62^\\circ)} \\approx \\frac{212.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.8884} \\approx 238.8\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the distances proposed in the options:\n- $L = 230\\,\\mathrm{mm}$: This distance is less than $L_{\\max}$ ($230\\,\\text{mm} < 238.8\\,\\text{mm}$). At this distance, the maximum d-spacing recorded at the corners is $d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin(\\theta)}$ where $2\\theta = \\arctan(R_{\\max}/L) = \\arctan(212.1/230) \\approx 42.68^\\circ$. This gives $d_{\\min} \\approx 0.976\\,\\text{\\AA}$, which satisfies the goal of reaching at least $1.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$. Thus, $L = 230\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is an acceptable distance.\n- $L = 280\\,\\mathrm{mm}$: This distance is greater than $L_{\\max}$. The highest resolution achievable is $d_{\\min} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin(\\theta)}$ where $2\\theta = \\arctan(212.1/280) \\approx 37.14^\\circ$. This gives $d_{\\min} \\approx 1.12\\,\\text{\\AA}$. This does not meet the required resolution of $1.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n\nBased on this analysis, any strategy with $L=280\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is invalid.\n\n**2. Rotation Range ($\\phi$), Completeness, and Redundancy**\n\nThe crystal has space group $P1$, which belongs to the triclinic crystal system. The Laue group is $\\bar{1}$. This is the lowest possible symmetry in three dimensions. The unique set of reflections (the asymmetric unit of reciprocal space) occupies a full hemisphere.\n- A rotation of $180^\\circ$ is the theoretical minimum to measure this unique hemisphere once (redundancy of $\\approx 1.0$). Due to geometric limitations such as the \"missing cone\" around the rotation axis, a $180^\\circ$ scan often results in completeness below $100\\,\\%$.\n- A rotation of $360^\\circ$ measures the entire sphere of reflections. For the centrosymmetric Laue group $\\bar{1}$, where $I(hkl) = I(\\bar{h}\\bar{k}\\bar{l})$, this means every unique reflection is measured twice. Thus, a $360^\\circ$ scan provides a theoretical redundancy of $2.0$.\n\nThe goal is to achieve redundancy of at least $2.0$.\n- A total rotation of $180^\\circ$ (Option C) yields a redundancy of $\\approx 1.0$, which fails the goal.\n- A total rotation of $220^\\circ$ (Option D) yields a redundancy of approximately $220^\\circ/180^\\circ \\approx 1.22$, which also fails the goal.\n- A total rotation of $360^\\circ$ (Option A) is required to achieve the redundancy goal of $2.0$.\n\n**3. Oscillation Width ($\\Delta\\phi$) and Reflection Overlap**\n\nThe unit cell is extremely large ($a, b, c > 45\\,\\text{\\AA}$), which implies that the reciprocal lattice points (RLPs) are very closely spaced. This presents a high risk of reflection overlap, both spatially (on the detector) and rotationally (multiple RLPs excited within one $\\Delta\\phi$ oscillation).\n\nThe rocking width of a reflection depends on crystal mosaicity, beam divergence, and spectral dispersion. A conservative estimate of the full rocking width, $\\Delta\\theta_\\text{rock}$, is the sum of the given intrinsic parameters:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_\\text{rock} \\approx \\sigma_\\text{mos} + \\sigma_\\text{div} = 0.25^\\circ + 0.05^\\circ = 0.30^\\circ $$\nTo avoid rotational overlap and to allow for accurate profiling of intensity, the oscillation width per image, $\\Delta\\phi$, should be chosen carefully.\n- If $\\Delta\\phi$ is much larger than $\\Delta\\theta_\\text{rock}$, multiple reflections can be active within a single exposure, leading to severe overlap. This is unacceptable for a large unit cell.\n- A \"fine-slicing\" strategy, where $\\Delta\\phi \\le \\Delta\\theta_\\text{rock}$, is the standard and necessary approach. It minimizes overlap by recording a finer sampling of reciprocal space and allows for the intensity of each reflection to be integrated over several consecutive frames.\n\nLet's examine the proposed $\\Delta\\phi$ values:\n- $\\Delta\\phi = 1.00^\\circ$ (Option C): This is more than three times the estimated rocking width ($1.00^\\circ \\gg 0.30^\\circ$). This will cause catastrophic reflection overlap and is an incorrect strategy for this crystal.\n- $\\Delta\\phi = 0.50^\\circ$ (Option B): Still significantly larger than the rocking width. This is also a poor choice.\n- $\\Delta\\phi = 0.20^\\circ$ (Option D): This is a fine-slicing approach ($\\Delta\\phi < \\Delta\\theta_\\text{rock}$). This is a reasonable strategy.\n- $\\Delta\\phi = 0.10^\\circ$ (Option A): This is an even finer slicing approach. For a very large unit cell, finer slicing provides a greater margin of safety against overlap. This is the most robust choice.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **Option A**: Set the detector at $L = 230\\,\\mathrm{mm}$; collect a full $\\phi$-rotation of $360^\\circ$ using fine slicing with an oscillation width $\\Delta\\phi = 0.10^\\circ$ per image.\n  - $L=230\\,\\mathrm{mm}$: **Correct**.

This practice [@problem_id:2515463] introduces the essential statistical figures of merit used to quantitatively assess the agreement between a model and the experimental evidence.

Assume independent Poisson counting statistics for the observed counts and standard weighted least squares is used, with weights $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$ and $\\sigma_i^2 = y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The model in this window depends effectively on $P=4$ refined parameters.

Round all four reported quantities to four significant figures. Your final answer must list the four values in the order $\\left(R_p,\\,R_{wp},\\,R_{\\exp},\\,\\chi^2\\right)$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a standard application of statistical analysis in the context of Rietveld refinement, a core technique in materials chemistry. The provided data are sufficient and consistent for the derivation and calculation of the requested quantities. The problem is therefore valid and will be solved.\n\nThe fundamental principle of a weighted least-squares refinement is the minimization of the sum of squared weighted residuals, $S$. This quantity is defined as:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2$$\nHere, $N$ is the number of data points, $y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is the observed intensity at point $i$, $y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}$ is the calculated intensity from the model at point $i$, and $w_i$ is the weight assigned to that point. The problem states that the weights are given by $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$, where $\\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the observed count. For a counting experiment governed by Poisson statistics, the variance of a count is equal to its expectation value. In practice, the observed count $y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is used as the best estimate of its own variance, so we set $\\sigma_i^2 = y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The weights are therefore $w_i = 1/y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $S$ gives:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}$$\n\nThe four requested quantities are derived as follows:\n\n1.  **Unweighted Profile Residual ($R_p$)**: This is an unweighted measure of the average fractional error, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between observed and calculated data, normalized by the sum of the observed data.\n    $$R_p = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} |y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}$$\n\n2.  **Weighted Profile Residual ($R_{wp}$)**: This is the statistically most significant residual, as it is directly related to the quantity $S$ that is minimized. It is defined as:\n    $$R_{wp} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}})^2} \\right]^{1/2}$$\n    Substituting $w_i = 1/y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$, the expression becomes:\n    $$R_{wp} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{S}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}} \\right]^{1/2}$$\n\n3.  **Expected Residual ($R_{\\exp}$)**: This represents the theoretical minimum value for $R_{wp}$ that one could expect if the model were perfect and the only discrepancies were due to counting statistics. The statistical expectation value for the minimized sum of squares is the number of degrees of freedom, which is the number of observations $N$ minus the number of refined parameters $P$.\n    $$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2\\right] = N - P$$\n    Replacing the numerator in the $R_{wp}$ formula with its expected value gives $R_{\\exp}$:\n    $$R_{\\exp} = \\left[ \\frac{N - P}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}})^2} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{N - P}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}} \\right]^{1/2}$$\n\n4.  **Goodness-of-Fit ($\\chi^2$)**: The goodness-of-fit, or chi-squared, is the ratio of the minimized sum of squares $S$ to its expected value, $N - P$. It serves as a measure of how well the model accounts for the statistical noise in the data.\n    $$\\chi^2 = \\frac{S}{N - P} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{N - P} = \\left(\\frac{R_{wp}}{R_{\\exp}}\\right)^2$$\n    A value of $\\chi^2 \\approx 1$ indicates that the fit is statistically sound.\n\nNow, we compute these values for the given data. We are given $N=10$ and $P=4$.\nFirst, we calculate the necessary sums from the provided data pairs $(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}},\\,y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})$:\n\n-   Sum of observed intensities:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 120 + 200 + 350 + 500 + 800 + 650 + 400 + 300 + 180 + 100 = 3600$$\n\n-   Sum of absolute differences:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} |y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}| = |120-116| + |200-210| + \\dots + |100-96|$$\n    $$= 4 + 10 + 17 + 21 + 20 + 20 + 22 + 11 + 10 + 4 = 139$$\n\n-   Minimized sum of squared weighted residuals, $S$:\n    $$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\frac{4^2}{120} + \\frac{(-10)^2}{200} + \\frac{17^2}{350} + \\frac{(-21)^2}{500} + \\frac{20^2}{800} + \\frac{20^2}{650} + \\frac{(-22)^2}{400} + \\frac{11^2}{300} + \\frac{(-10)^2}{180} + \\frac{4^2}{100}$$\n    $$S \\approx 0.133333 + 0.500000 + 0.825714 + 0.882000 + 0.500000 + 0.615385 + 1.210000 + 0.403333 + 0.555556 + 0.160000 \\approx 5.785321$$\n\nUsing these sums, we calculate the four indicators, rounding each to four significant figures as required:\n\n-   $R_p = \\frac{139}{3600} \\approx 0.0386111 \\approx 0.03861$\n\n-   $R_{wp} = \\left[ \\frac{5.785321}{3600} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ 0.00160703 \\right]^{1/2} \\approx 0.0400878 \\approx 0.04009$\n\n-   $R_{\\exp} = \\left[ \\frac{10-4}{3600} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{6}{3600} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{600} \\right]^{1/2} \\approx 0.0408248 \\approx 0.04082$\n\n-   $\\chi^2 = \\frac{5.785321}{10-4} = \\frac{5.785321}{6} \\approx 0.964220 \\approx 0.9642$\n\nFinally, we must assess the quality of the fit. The conventional criterion for a successful refinement is that the model sufficiently explains the data when the goodness-of-fit $\\chi^2$ is close to unity. Our calculated value is $\\chi^2 \\approx 0.9642$, which is indeed very close to $1$. This indicates that the magnitude of the residuals $(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})$ is consistent with what would be expected from random Poisson counting statistics alone. Therefore, the model is considered to provide a sufficient explanation for the experimental noise in this data window.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03861 & 0.04009 & 0.04082 & 0.9642 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2515463"}]}
