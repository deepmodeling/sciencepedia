All necessary information is provided, and the problem is a standard, fundamental exercise in solid-state physics and crystallography.\n\nThe structure factor, $F_{hkl}$, for a set of Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ is defined as the Fourier transform of the electron density distribution within a single unit cell. For a crystal with a basis of $N$ atoms, this can be expressed as a discrete sum over the atoms in the basis:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j \\exp[2 \\pi i (h x_j + k y_j + l z_j)]\n$$\nIn this expression:\n- $j$ is the index of an atom in the basis, from $1$ to $N$.\n- $f_j$ is the atomic scattering factor of the $j$-th atom. This factor depends on the element and the scattering vector magnitude, but for a given reflection $(h,k,l)$, it is treated as a specific value.

The specifics are:\n1.  The number of atoms in the basis is $N=1$.\n2.  The single atom in the basis has an atomic scattering factor denoted by $f$. Thus, $f_1 = f$.\n3.  The atom is located at the origin of the unit cell, meaning its fractional coordinates are $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nSubstituting these specific conditions into the general formula for the structure factor, the sum over $j$ reduces to a single term for $j=1$:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f_1 \\exp[2 \\pi i (h x_1 + k y_1 + l z_1)]\n$$\nPlacing the values for the coordinates and scattering factor:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f \\exp[2 \\pi i (h \\cdot 0 + k \\cdot 0 + l \\cdot 0)]\n$$\nThis simplifies the exponent:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f \\exp[2 \\pi i (0)] = f \\exp(0)\n$$\nSince for any number $z$, $\\exp(0) = 1$, the expression for the structure factor becomes:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = f\n$$\nThis result is valid for any integer triplet $(h,k,l)$.\n\nNext, we must determine the condition for which the kinematic Bragg intensity is nonzero. The scattered intensity $I_{hkl}$ for a given reflection $(h,k,l)$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the structure factor:\n$$\nI_{hkl} \\propto |F_{hkl}|^2\n$$\nFor the intensity to be nonzero, it is required that $|F_{hkl}|^2 \\neq 0$, which implies that $F_{hkl} \\neq 0$.\n\nIn our case, $F_{hkl} = f$. The atomic scattering factor $f$ is a function of the scattering angle and atomic number, but it is fundamentally nonzero for any physically realistic scattering condition (i.e., for any finite scattering vector). Therefore, $F_{hkl}$ is nonzero for all possible integer values of $h$, $k$, and $l$.\n\nThis means there are no systematic absences for a primitive simple cubic lattice. All reflections defined by any integer triplet $(h,k,l)$ are allowed.\n\nThe final task is to construct a single closed-form expression that gives the value of $F_{hkl}$ for allowed reflections and is zero for forbidden reflections. Since there are no forbidden reflections, the \"indicator function\" for the reflection condition is identically equal to $1$ for all integer triplets $(h,k,l)$.

Their existence depends on both ordering ($2c-1 \\neq 0$) and a contrast in scattering lengths ($b_{\\mathrm{A}} \\neq b_{\\mathrm{B}}$).\n\nThe problem asks for the $(1,0,0)$ reflection. For this, $h+k+l = 1+0+0 = 1$, which is odd. This is a superlattice reflection. The Bragg intensity $I_{(100)}$ is proportional to the square of the modulus of the structure factor:\n$$I_{(100)} \\propto |F_{\\text{cell}}(1,0,0)|^2 = |(2c-1)(b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})|^2 = (2c-1)^2 (b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2$$\nThis expression describes how the Bragg intensity of the $(1,0,0)$ reflection depends on the sublattice occupation probability $c$.\n\nTo find the scaling factor relative to the perfectly ordered limit, we first consider the state of perfect order. This corresponds to atoms A exclusively on sublattice $1$ and atoms B exclusively on sublattice $2$, which means $c=1$. The intensity in this limit is:\n$$I_{(100), \\text{ordered}} \\propto (2(1)-1)^2 (b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2 = (b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2$$\nThe scaling factor $\\Phi$ is the ratio of the intensity in the partially ordered state to the intensity in the perfectly ordered state:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{I_{(100), \\text{partial}}}{I_{(100), \\text{ordered}}} = \\frac{(2c-1)^2 (b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2}{(b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2} = (2c-1)^2$$\nThis is the explicitly identified factor. It is equivalent to the square of the long-range order parameter $S=2c-1$.\n\nThe problem also requires identifying how the diffuse intensity is governed by fluctuations. The diffuse intensity is $I_{\\text{diffuse}} \\propto \\langle |F_{\\text{tot}} - \\langle F_{\\text{tot}} \\rangle|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |\\sum_j (b_j - \\langle b_j \\rangle) e^{i\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_j}|^2 \\rangle$.\nWith the assumption of no short-range order, the occupancies of different sites are uncorrelated. Therefore, $\\langle (b_j - \\langle b_j \\rangle)(b_k - \\langle b_k \\rangle) \\rangle = \\delta_{jk} \\langle |b_j - \\langle b_j \\rangle|^2 \\rangle$. The diffuse scattering intensity becomes:\n$$I_{\\text{diffuse}}(\\mathbf{Q}) \\propto \\sum_j \\langle |b_j - \\langle b_j \\rangle|^2 \\rangle$$\nThis is the sum of the variances of the scattering length over all sites. The variance is the same for all sites on a given sublattice. The variance for a site on sublattice $1$ is $\\langle b_1^2 \\rangle - \\langle b_1 \\rangle^2$.\n$\\langle b_1^2 \\rangle = \\langle (\\sigma_{1} b_{\\mathrm{A}} + (1-\\sigma_{1}) b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\sigma_{1} \\rangle b_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 + (1 - \\langle \\sigma_{1} \\rangle) b_{\\mathrm{B}}^2 = c b_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 + (1-c) b_{\\mathrm{B}}^2$.\nThe variance is $\\langle b_1^2 \\rangle - \\langle b_1 \\rangle^2 = [c b_{\\mathrm{A}}^2 + (1-c) b_{\\mathrm{B}}^2] - [c b_{\\mathrm{A}} + (1-c) b_{\\mathrm{B}}]^2 = c(1-c)(b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2$.\nA symmetric calculation gives the same variance for sublattice $2$. Thus, the total diffuse intensity is:\n$$I_{\\text{diffuse}} \\propto N c(1-c)(b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2$$\nThe diffuse intensity arises from the site-to-site fluctuations in chemical occupancy, and its magnitude is governed by the factor $c(1-c)(b_{\\mathrm{A}} - b_{\\mathrm{B}})^2$. This represents the Laue monotonic scattering, which is independent of $\\mathbf{Q}$ in this model.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the dimensionless scaling factor $\\Phi = (2c-1)^2$ for the given value $c=0.82$.
