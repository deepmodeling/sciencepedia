This assumption is justified by the physics of electron scattering. The interaction volume has a \"teardrop\" shape. For low-$Z$ materials like aluminum, elastic scattering events are less frequent, so electrons travel deeper before significant lateral diffusion occurs, forming an elongated teardrop. The maximum lateral spread typically occurs at a depth of roughly one-third to one-half of the total range.
