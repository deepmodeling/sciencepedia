The evaluation must be based on two criteria: minimizing X-ray absorption losses and ensuring the characteristic X-rays are physically excitable with the given electron beam energy.\n\nFirst, I shall validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Accelerating voltage:** $E_{0}=10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n- **Element of interest:** Titanium (Ti) in a Ti-Al alloy\n- **Characteristic lines for consideration:**\n    - $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K\\alpha$ at energy $E_{K\\alpha} \\approx 4.51\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n    - $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L\\alpha$ at energy $E_{L\\alpha} \\approx 0.45\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n- **Titanium K-shell ionization edge:** $E_{\\mathrm{c},K}\\approx 4.966\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n- **Detector take-off angle:** $\\theta = 35^{\\circ}$\n- **Characteristic X-ray generation depth:** up to $z = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- **Governing physics:**\n    - Beer–Lambert law: $I=I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left[-(\\mu/\\rho)\\,\\rho\\,\\ell\\right]$\n    - Overvoltage ratio: $U_{0}=E_{0}/E_{\\mathrm{c}}$, with efficient excitation for $U_{0}\\gtrsim 1.5$–$2$\n    - Energy dependence of mass attenuation coefficient: $\\mu/\\rho$ decreases strongly as photon energy increases.\n- **Assumptions and constants:**\n    - Absorption is dominated by aluminum (Al).\n    - Aluminum density: $\\rho_{\\mathrm{Al}}=2.70\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$\n    - Mass attenuation coefficients for Al:\n        - $\\left(\\mu/\\rho\\right)_{\\mathrm{Al}}$ at $0.45\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ is $\\approx 1.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,g^{-1}}$\n        - $\\left(\\mu/\\rho\\right)_{\\mathrm{Al}}$ at $4.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ is $\\approx 150\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,g^{-1}}$\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard scenario in materials microanalysis. The physical principles cited (Beer-Lambert law, overvoltage) are correct. The numerical values provided for energies, density, and mass attenuation coefficients are physically realistic and internally consistent. For example, the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K\\alpha$ line energy ($4.51\\,\\mathrm{keV}$) is correctly stated as being less than the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K$-edge energy ($4.966\\,\\mathrm{keV}$). The problem provides all necessary information to perform the required analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe analysis is broken down into evaluating the two required conditions: excitability and absorption.\n\n**1. Excitability of Ti K- and L-lines**\n\nFor a characteristic X-ray to be generated, the incident electron beam energy $E_0$ must exceed the critical ionization energy (absorption edge) $E_c$ of the corresponding atomic shell. The efficiency of this process is described by the overvoltage ratio, $U_0 = E_0/E_c$.\n\n*   **For Ti K-series:**\n    The critical ionization energy is given as $E_{\\mathrm{c},K}\\approx 4.966\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n    The incident beam energy is $E_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n    Since $E_0 > E_{\\mathrm{c},K}$ ($10\\,\\mathrm{keV} > 4.966\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), the titanium $K$-shell can be ionized, and $K$-series X-rays can be generated.\n    The overvoltage ratio is:\n    $$U_{0,K} = \\frac{E_{0}}{E_{\\mathrm{c},K}} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{4.966\\,\\mathrm{keV}} \\approx 2.01$$\n    This value falls within the optimal range for efficient excitation ($U_0 \\gtrsim 1.5$–$2$), meaning the Ti $K$-lines will be generated with high efficiency.\n\n*   **For Ti L-series:**\n    The problem gives the energy of the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L\\alpha$ line as $E_{L\\alpha} \\approx 0.45\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. The critical ionization energy of the $L$-shell, $E_{\\mathrm{c},L}$, must be slightly higher than this value. Standard data confirm the Ti $L_3$-edge is at $E_{\\mathrm{c},L_3} = 0.454\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n    Since $E_0 > E_{\\mathrm{c},L}$ ($10\\,\\mathrm{keV} \\gg 0.454\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), the titanium $L$-shell is also readily ionized.\n    The overvoltage ratio is:\n    $$U_{0,L} = \\frac{E_{0}}{E_{\\mathrm{c},L}} \\approx \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{0.454\\,\\mathrm{keV}} \\approx 22$$\n    While excitation is certainly possible, this very high overvoltage means that the primary electrons will penetrate deeper into the sample, generating X-rays from a larger interaction volume. This increases the average path length for X-rays to escape the sample, which will amplify absorption effects.\n\nFrom the excitability standpoint, both lines can be generated, but the conditions for the $K$-line are more favorable for standard quantitative analysis.\n\n**2. Absorption Losses of Ti K- and L-lines**\n\nThe intensity of X-rays, $I$, emerging from the sample is related to the generated intensity, $I_0$, by the Beer-Lambert law, $I=I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left[-(\\mu/\\rho)\\,\\rho\\,\\ell\\right]$. To minimize absorption losses, the term in the exponent, $(\\mu/\\rho)\\,\\rho\\,\\ell$, must be minimized. The path length of an X-ray generated at depth $z$ is $\\ell = z/\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta=35^{\\circ}$ is the take-off angle. The problem states that aluminum dominates absorption.\n\n*   **For Ti K-series ($E \\approx 4.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}$):**\n    The mass attenuation coefficient is given as $\\left(\\mu/\\rho\\right)_{\\mathrm{Al}} \\approx 150\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,g^{-1}}$.\n\n*   **For Ti L-series ($E \\approx 0.45\\,\\mathrm{keV}$):**\n    The mass attenuation coefficient is given as $\\left(\\mu/\\rho\\right)_{\\mathrm{Al}} \\approx 1.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,g^{-1}}$.\n\nA direct comparison shows that the mass attenuation coefficient for the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L\\alpha$ line is much larger than for the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K\\alpha$ line:\n$$ \\frac{\\left(\\mu/\\rho\\right)_{\\mathrm{Al, L\\alpha}}}{\\left(\\mu/\\rho\\right)_{\\mathrm{Al, K\\alpha}}} = \\frac{1.0\\times 10^{4}}{150} \\approx 66.7 $$\nThe absorption of the low-energy $L\\alpha$ X-rays is intrinsically about $67$ times stronger than that of the higher-energy $K\\alpha$ X-rays.\n\nLet us calculate the fraction of transmitted intensity for an X-ray generated at the representative depth $z=1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe path length is $\\ell = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) / \\sin(35^{\\circ}) \\approx 1.74 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe density is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{Al}}=2.70\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$.\n\n*   **Transmitted fraction for Ti K$\\alpha$:**\n    $$ \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp\\!\\left[ -150\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{cm^2}}{\\mathrm{g}} \\times 2.70\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}} \\times 1.74 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\right] \\approx \\exp(-0.070) \\approx 0.932 $$\n    About $93.2\\%$ of the generated $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K\\alpha$ intensity is transmitted, meaning absorption loss is only about $6.8\\%$. This is a small and correctable amount.\n\n*   **Transmitted fraction for Ti L$\\alpha$:**\n    $$ \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp\\!\\left[ -1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{cm^2}}{\\mathrm{g}} \\times 2.70\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{cm^3}} \\times 1.74 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\right] \\approx \\exp(-4.70) \\approx 0.009 $$\n    Only about $0.9\\%$ of the generated $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L\\alpha$ intensity is transmitted. The absorption loss is over $99.1\\%$. This level of absorption is extreme and makes quantitative analysis unreliable or impossible.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe Ti $K$-lines are not only efficiently excitable at $E_0=10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, but they also suffer dramatically less absorption in the aluminum matrix compared to the Ti $L$-lines. The Ti $L$-lines, while excitable, are so severely absorbed that they are unsuitable for quantification in this context. Therefore, the choice that best minimizes absorption losses while being excitable is to use the Ti $K$-lines.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Use $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K$-lines; their higher photon energy yields much lower $\\mu/\\rho$ in aluminum, strongly reducing absorption, and $E_{0}=10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ provides sufficient overvoltage to excite $K$-shell emission.**\n    This statement accurately reflects the analysis. The higher energy of the $K$-lines ($\\approx 4.51\\,\\mathrm{keV}$) leads to a much smaller mass attenuation coefficient compared to the $L$-lines ($\\approx 0.45\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), thus minimizing absorption. The accelerating voltage of $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ provides an overvoltage of $U_0 \\approx 2.01$ for the $K$-shell, which is ideal for efficient excitation. This option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Use $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L$-lines; although they are more strongly absorbed, their lower energy increases ionization cross-section enough to outweigh absorption, so they minimize net absorption effects.**\n    This statement is flawed. While the ionization cross-section is generally larger for lower-energy shells, the concept that this could \"outweigh\" an absorption of over $99\\%$ is physically absurd. Moreover, the ionization cross-section is a function of overvoltage, and the very high overvoltage for the $L$-shell ($U_0 \\approx 22$) places it far past the peak efficiency, while the $K$-shell's overvoltage ($U_0 \\approx 2$) is near optimal. The claim that this choice would \"minimize net absorption effects\" is a direct contradiction of the physical reality calculated above. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Either $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K$- or $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L$-lines; absorption in aluminum depends mainly on composition and is essentially independent of photon energy above threshold, so both are comparable.**\n    This statement makes a factually incorrect claim. The assertion that absorption is \"essentially independent of photon energy\" is contradicted by fundamental physics and the very data provided in the problem statement, which show a nearly $100$-fold difference in the mass attenuation coefficient between the two energies. Consequently, the two choices are not comparable. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Neither $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K$- nor $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,L$-lines are suitable; $E_{0}=10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ is insufficient to excite $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K$-lines, so absorption cannot be minimized without increasing $E_{0}$.**\n    This statement's primary premise is false. The condition for excitation is $E_0 > E_c$. Here, $10\\,\\mathrm{keV} > 4.966\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, so the $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,K$-lines are excited. The conclusion that absorption cannot be minimized is therefore baseless. One minimizes absorption by choosing the $K$-lines, which are readily available.

Since the incident events arrive as a stationary Poisson process with a true rate of $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, the number of events that arrive and are successfully recorded during the live time is given by:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{out}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} T_{\\mathrm{live}}\n$$\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $N_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{live}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} T = R_{\\mathrm{in}} [T(1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau)]\n$$\nThe total time $T$ is a non-zero quantity and can be canceled from both sides, yielding the relationship between the rates:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} (1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau)\n$$\nThe problem requires an explicit expression for the true input rate, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}{1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau}\n$$\nThis is the dead-time correction formula for a nonparalyzable detector. The term $R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau$ represents the fraction of time the detector is busy, also known as the dead time fraction. For a physically meaningful solution, this fraction must be less than $1$, i.e., $R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau  1$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Measured output rate: $R_{\\mathrm{out}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{kcps} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Detector dead time: $\\tau = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless dead time fraction, $R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau = (5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 5 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.05\n$$\nSince $0.05  1$, the measurement is not fully saturated and a corrected rate can be computed.\n\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived formula for $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.95}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{5}{0.95} \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 5.26315789... \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in kilo-counts per second (kcps) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} \\approx 52.6315789...\\,\\mathrm{kcps}\n$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} \\approx 52.63\\,\\mathrm{kcps}\n$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{52.63}$$", "id": "2486240"}]}
