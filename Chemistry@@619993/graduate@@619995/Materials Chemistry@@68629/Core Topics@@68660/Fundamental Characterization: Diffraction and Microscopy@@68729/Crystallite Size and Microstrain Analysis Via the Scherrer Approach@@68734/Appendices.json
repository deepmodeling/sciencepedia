This requires isolating the true physical broadening due to crystallite size, $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$, from the observed broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{obs}}$. The observed profile is a convolution of the instrumental profile and the sample's intrinsic profile. The problem states that the crystallite size contribution is Gaussian, the instrumental contribution is Gaussian, and hence the observed profile is also Gaussian.\n\nA core principle provided is that the convolution of independent Gaussian functions yields a Gaussian whose variance is the sum of the individual variances. For a Gaussian distribution, the square of the FWHM is directly proportional to the variance ($\\beta^2 = c \\sigma^2$, where $c = 8\\ln(2)$). Therefore, the FWHMs of the convolved profiles are related by the sum of their squares:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{obs}}^2 = \\beta_{\\text{size}}^2 + \\beta_{\\text{inst}}^2$$\nThe problem specifies that microstrain is negligible, so the sample broadening is entirely due to crystallite size. From this relation, we solve for the true size-related broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{size}} = \\sqrt{\\beta_{\\text{obs}}^2 - \\beta_{\\text{inst}}^2}$$\nNote that this relationship holds regardless of whether the breadths are measured in degrees or radians, as long as the units are consistent across all terms.

This arises because the diffracted intensity profile along a reciprocal-lattice direction reflects the Fourier transform of the crystallite’s shape-autocorrelation, so that the characteristic breadth scales inversely with a representative real-space dimension of the coherently scattering domain. The proportionality factor that links this size-dependent breadth to a real-space length depends on the crystallite shape, the definition of the peak breadth (for example, full width at half maximum (FWHM) versus integral breadth), and the line-shape form (for example, Cauchy-like versus Gaussian-like).

The two common definitions are the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the integral breadth ($\\beta_i$), defined as the total area under the peak divided by its maximum intensity.\n2.  The three-dimensional shape of the crystallites (e.g., spheres, cubes, needles, platelets).\n3.  The specific crystallographic direction, indexed by $(hkl)$, corresponding to the diffraction peak being analyzed. For anisotropic shapes, $L$ and $K$ will vary with $(hkl)$.\n\nThe approximation $K \\approx 0.89$ is a classical result, traceable to early theoretical work by Scherrer and later refined by Patterson and others. Specifically, this value is derived under the following conditions:\n- The crystallites are assumed to be spherical, monodisperse, and randomly oriented.\n- The peak breadth is defined as the FWHM.\n- Under these conditions, the theoretical size-broadened line shape is closely approximated by a squared Cauchy (Lorentzian-squared) function, which is itself \"Cauchy-like\" or Lorentzian-like in character.\n\nWhen the crystallite shape deviates significantly from being equiaxed (e.g., for platelets or needles), the shape factor $K$ becomes strongly dependent on the Miller indices $(hkl)$ of the reflection. The measured dimension $L$ corresponds to the crystallite size perpendicular to the $(hkl)$ planes. For highly anisotropic particles, the value of $K$ (for FWHM) can vary over a wide range. Advanced crystallographic texts and literature (e.g., works by Langford, Louër, and Stokes) demonstrate that values for various polyhedral shapes and orientations can range from below $0.7$ to above $1.5$. A range from approximately $0.6$ to $1.5$ is a realistic estimate for common anisotropic morphologies.\n\nWe are asked to quantify the systematic error incurred by using an approximate value $K_{\\text{approx}} = 0.89$ when the true value is $K_{\\text{true}}$.

It correctly states that for anisotropic shapes, the shape factor spans a wide range. The given range of $0.62$ to $1.50$ is physically reasonable. Finally, the error analysis is consistent with our calculations: an overestimation (positive bias) of about $+40\\%$ for $K_{\\text{true}} \\approx 0.62$ and an underestimation (negative bias) of about $-40\\%$ for $K_{\\text{true}} \\approx 1.50$. This option is correct.\n\n**B. The approximation $K \\approx 0.89$ is universally valid regardless of crystallite shape, preferred orientation, peak-shape form, or whether FWHM or integral breadth is used; the resulting systematic error remains below $5\\%$ even for extreme platelets or needles.**\nThis statement is fundamentally false. The shape factor $K$ is explicitly dependent on shape and breadth definition.\n\n**C. The approximation $K \\approx 0.89$ is justified only when microstrain dominates the breadth and size effects are negligible; when size effects dominate, one must use $K \\approx 1.39$. If used for thin platelets or needles, $K=0.89$ underestimates the size by a factor of $2$ to $3$.**\nThis option is incorrect. The Scherrer constant $K$ is for size broadening; if microstrain dominates, the Scherrer equation is not the relevant tool. The error is not always an underestimation.\n\n**D. The approximation $K \\approx 0.89$ applies to spherical domains exclusively when integral breadth of a purely Gaussian peak is used. For thin platelets measured on a reflection normal to the platelet face, using $K=0.89$ will overestimate the thickness by roughly a factor of $2$, largely independent of orientation distribution.**\nThis option incorrectly associates $K \\approx 0.89$ with integral breadth and Gaussian peaks. It is for FWHM and typically Cauchy-like peaks. Furthermore, for a thin platelet measured normal to its face, the true shape factor $K_{\\text{true}}$ is typically greater than $1$, leading to an *underestimation* of the thickness if $K=0.89$ is used.\n\n**E.
