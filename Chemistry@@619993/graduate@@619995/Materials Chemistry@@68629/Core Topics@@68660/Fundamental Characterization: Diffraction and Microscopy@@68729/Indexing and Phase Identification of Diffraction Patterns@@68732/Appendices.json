It is based on the fundamental principles of X-ray crystallography, namely Bragg's law and the geometry of cubic lattices. The provided data are complete and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution when physical context is considered. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part calculation and a theoretical explanation. First, the interplanar spacings $d_i$ for the four observed diffraction peaks are computed. Second, the crystal structure is identified as either primitive cubic (P) or body-centered cubic (BCC) by indexing the pattern. Third, the lattice parameter $a$ is calculated from the indexed peaks. Finally, a first-principles explanation of the indexing convention concerning the diffraction order $n$ is required.\n\nStep 1: Computation of Interplanar Spacings $d_i$\n\nBragg's law describes the condition for constructive interference of X-rays scattered by crystal planes:\n$$n\\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta$$\nwhere $n$ is the diffraction order (an integer), $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays, $d$ is the interplanar spacing, and $\\theta$ is the scattering angle.\nThe problem states to assume first-order diffraction, so $n=1$. The wavelength is given as $\\lambda = 1.5406$ Å. The law simplifies to $\\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta$. We can solve for the interplanar spacing $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin\\theta}$$\nThe experimental data are given as $2\\theta$ values. We must first find $\\theta$ for each peak.\n\nPeak 1: $2\\theta_1 = 44.54^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_1 = 22.27^{\\circ}$\n$$d_1 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(22.27^{\\circ})} \\approx 2.0324 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nPeak 2: $2\\theta_2 = 64.67^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_2 = 32.335^{\\circ}$\n$$d_2 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(32.335^{\\circ})} \\approx 1.4400 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nPeak 3: $2\\theta_3 = 82.00^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_3 = 41.00^{\\circ}$\n$$d_3 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(41.00^{\\circ})} \\approx 1.1741 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nPeak 4: $2\\theta_4 = 98.60^{\\circ} \\implies \\theta_4 = 49.30^{\\circ}$\n$$d_4 = \\frac{1.5406}{2\\sin(49.30^{\\circ})} \\approx 1.0161 \\text{ Å}$$\n\nStep 2: Indexing and Structure Determination\n\nFor a cubic crystal system, the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ for a set of planes with Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ is related to the lattice parameter $a$ by:\n$$d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$$\nCombining this with Bragg's law (for $n=1$):\n$$\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sin\\theta_{hkl}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$$\nSquaring and rearranging gives a linear relationship between $\\sin^2\\theta$ and the sum of squared indices:\n$$\\sin^2\\theta_{hkl} = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4a^2}(h^2+k^2+l^2)$$\nSince $\\frac{\\lambda^2}{4a^2}$ is a constant for a given experiment on a specific crystal, the values of $\\sin^2\\theta_i$ for the observed peaks must be proportional to the values of $S_i = h_i^2+k_i^2+l_i^2$, which are integers.\nAlternatively, we can analyze the ratio of $1/d_i^2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{d_i^2} = \\frac{1}{a^2}(h_i^2+k_i^2+l_i^2)$$\nLet's compute $1/d_i^2$ for our four peaks:\n$1/d_1^2 \\approx 1/(2.0324)^2 \\approx 0.2421$ Å$^{-2}$\n$1/d_2^2 \\approx 1/(1.4400)^2 \\approx 0.4823$ Å$^{-2}$\n$1/d_3^2 \\approx 1/(1.1741)^2 \\approx 0.7251$ Å$^{-2}$\n$1/d_4^2 \\approx 1/(1.0161)^2 \\approx 0.9680$ Å$^{-2}$\n\nTo find the integer relationship, we divide each value by the smallest value, $0.2421$:\nRatio 1: $0.2421 / 0.2421 = 1.000$\nRatio 2: $0.4823 / 0.2421 \\approx 1.992 \\approx 2$\nRatio 3: $0.7251 / 0.2421 \\approx 2.995 \\approx 3$\nRatio 4: $0.9680 / 0.2421 \\approx 3.998 \\approx 4$\nThe ratios of the quantities $(h^2+k^2+l^2)$ for the four peaks are $1:2:3:4$.\n\nNow we must compare this sequence with the allowed reflections for Primitive Cubic (P) and Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattices.\n- For a P-cubic lattice, all $\\{hkl\\}$ reflections are allowed. The possible values for $S=h^2+k^2+l^2$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, ...$ (note that $S=7$ cannot be formed by the sum of three integer squares). The expected ratio sequence for the first few peaks is $1:2:3:4:5:6:8$. Our observed ratio $1:2:3:4$ is consistent with the start of this sequence.\n- For a BCC lattice, reflections are only allowed when the sum $h+k+l$ is an even number. The allowed values for $S=h^2+k^2+l^2$ are:\n  - $\\{110\\}: S = 1^2+1^2+0^2 = 2$\n  - $\\{200\\}: S = 2^2+0^2+0^2 = 4$\n  - $\\{211\\}: S = 2^2+1^2+1^2 = 6$\n  - $\\{220\\}: S = 2^2+2^2+0^2 = 8$\n  - ...and so on. The sequence of allowed $S$ values is $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...$. The ratio of these values is $1:2:3:4:5...$. Our observed ratio $1:2:3:4$ is also consistent with the start of this sequence.\n\nThe experimental data are mathematically consistent with both hypotheses. However, the problem is one of physical science, not pure mathematics. Primitive cubic crystal structures are extremely rare in elements, with polonium being the only known example under standard conditions. Body-centered cubic structures, on the other hand, are very common (e.g., Fe, Cr, Mo, W). The calculated lattice parameter for the BCC hypothesis ($a \\approx 2.87$ Å) is characteristic of many common metals, such as $\\alpha$-iron ($a=2.8665$ Å). The P-cubic hypothesis yields a much smaller lattice parameter ($a \\approx 2.03$ Å), which is less physically plausible for a metallic element. Therefore, based on physical and chemical reasoning, the BCC indexing is the correct choice.\n\nThe Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ are assigned based on the sequence $S = 2, 4, 6, 8$:\n- Peak 1 ($S=2$): $\\{110\\}$\n- Peak 2 ($S=4$): $\\{200\\}$\n- Peak 3 ($S=6$): $\\{211\\}$\n- Peak 4 ($S=8$): $\\{220\\}$\n\nStep 3: Calculation of Lattice Parameter $a$\n\nWe compute the lattice parameter $a_i$ from each diffraction line using the formula $a_i = d_i \\sqrt{h_i^2+k_i^2+l_i^2}$. Using the more precise values for $d_i$:\n$a_1 = d_1 \\sqrt{2} = 2.03236 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.8742$ Å\n$a_2 = d_2 \\sqrt{4} = 1.43999 \\times 2 \\approx 2.8800$ Å\n$a_3 = d_3 \\sqrt{6} = 1.17414 \\times \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.8761$ Å\n$a_4 = d_4 \\sqrt{8} = 1.01605 \\times \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.8738$ Å\n\nThe best estimate for $a$ is the arithmetic mean of these four values:\n$$\\bar{a} = \\frac{a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4}{4} = \\frac{2.8742 + 2.8800 + 2.8761 + 2.8738}{4} = \\frac{11.5041}{4} \\approx 2.876025 \\text{ Å}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the lattice parameter is $a = 2.876$ Å.\n\nExplanation of the role of $n$ in Bragg's Law and Indexing\n\nBragg's law is $n\\lambda = 2d_{hkl}\\sin\\theta$. A diffraction peak can be described by a combination of the Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ of a family of crystal planes and the integer order of diffraction $n$. For a cubic crystal, substituting $d_{hkl} = a/\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}$ gives:\n$$n\\lambda = 2 \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} \\sin\\theta$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\lambda = 2 \\left( \\frac{a}{n\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} \\right) \\sin\\theta$$\nLet us define a new set of Miller indices $\\{h'k'l'\\} = \\{nh, nk, nl\\}$. The interplanar spacing for these hypothetical planes would be:\n$$d_{h'k'l'} = d_{nh,nk,nl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{(nh)^2+(nk)^2+(nl)^2}} = \\frac{a}{n\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} = \\frac{d_{hkl}}{n}$$\nSubstituting this into the rewritten Bragg's law yields:\n$$\\lambda = 2 d_{h'k'l'} \\sin\\theta$$\nThis equation is mathematically identical to a first-order ($n=1$) reflection from a set of planes with Miller indices $\\{h'k'l'\\} = \\{nh, nk, nl\\}$.\n\nThis means that an $n$-th order reflection from the $\\{hkl\\}$ planes is experimentally indistinguishable from a first-order reflection from the $\\{nh, nk, nl\\}$ planes, as both occur at the same scattering angle $\\theta$. For example, the second-order reflection from the $(100)$ plane ($n=2, \\{hkl\\}=\\{100\\}$) appears at the exact same position as the first-order reflection from the $(200)$ plane ($n=1, \\{hkl\\}=\\{200\\}$).\n\nIf one were to allow $n1$ as an independent variable during indexing, any given diffraction peak at angle $\\theta$ could be assigned an infinite number of possible $(n, \\{hkl\\})$ combinations, resulting in a completely ambiguous and ill-posed problem. To resolve this, the standard crystallographic convention is to *always* assume first-order diffraction ($n=1$). The Miller indices $\\{hkl\\}$ assigned to a peak are then understood to be the set $\\{nh_0, nk_0, nl_0\\}$, where $\\{h_0k_0l_0\\}$ are the fundamental indices (the simplest integers representing the plane orientation) and $n$ is the diffraction order, which has been absorbed into the indices. This convention renders the indexing procedure unique and systematic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.876}$$", "id": "2492901"}, {"introduction": "While peak positions reveal the geometry of the unit cell, their intensities hold the key to the arrangement of atoms within it.

This term is non-zero only if the Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ are all even or all odd (unmixed parity). In these cases, the sums $h+k$, $h+l$, and $k+l$ are all even, causing each exponential term to be $1$, and the lattice factor evaluates to $1+1+1+1=4$. If the indices are of mixed parity, the lattice factor is $0$.

The structure factor $F_{hkl}$ is defined as the Fourier transform of the electron density within one unit cell. For a crystal with $M$ atoms in the unit cell, where the $j$-th atom is at fractional coordinates $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ and has an atomic scattering factor $f_j$, the structure factor is given by:\n$$\nF_{hkl} = \\sum_{j=1}^{M} f_j \\exp[2\\pi i (hx_j + ky_j + lz_j)]\n$$\nSystematic absences, or reflection conditions, arise when translational symmetry elements within the crystal lattice cause the structure factor $F_{hkl}$ to be identically zero for specific classes of $(h,k,l)$. The problem states that we need to consider only the extinction conditions arising from lattice centering, as the material is centrosymmetric with no glide planes or screw axes beyond those intrinsic to a centered lattice with $mmm$ point group symmetry. We will now derive the reflection conditions for each of the four lattice types: primitive ($P$), base-centered ($C$), face-centered ($F$), and body-centered ($I$).\n\n1.  **Primitive Lattice ($P$)**:\n    A primitive lattice has only one lattice point per unit cell, conventionally at $(0,0,0)$. There are no additional translational symmetry operations within the cell. The structure factor contains no systematic term that would lead to general extinctions.\n    Reflection condition for $P$-lattice: None. All $(h,k,l)$ reflections are allowed.\n\n2.  **C-Centered Lattice ($C$)**:\n    A $C$-centered lattice has lattice points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(1/2, 1/2, 0)$. This means for every atom at $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$, there is an identical atom at $(x_j + 1/2, y_j + 1/2, z_j)$. The structure factor can be written by summing over the atoms in the primitive basis and multiplying by a lattice-specific term:\n    $$\n    F_{hkl} = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{M/2} f_j \\exp[2\\pi i (hx_j + ky_j + lz_j)] \\right) \\left( 1 + \\exp[2\\pi i (h/2 + k/2)] \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    F_{hkl} = F'_{hkl} \\left( 1 + \\exp[i\\pi(h+k)] \\right)\n    $$\n    The term $(1 + \\exp[i\\pi(h+k)])$ evaluates to $2$ if $h+k$ is an even integer and $0$ if $h+k$ is an odd integer.\n    Reflection condition for $C$-lattice: $h+k=2n$, where $n$ is an integer. Reflections are systematically absent if $h+k$ is odd.\n\n3.  **Face-Centered Lattice ($F$)**:\n    An $F$-centered lattice has lattice points at $(0,0,0)$, $(0,1/2,1/2)$, $(1/2,0,1/2)$, and $(1/2,1/2,0)$. The structure factor is:\n    $$\n    F_{hkl} = F'_{hkl} \\left( 1 + \\exp[i\\pi(k+l)] + \\exp[i\\pi(h+l)] + \\exp[i\\pi(h+k)] \\right)\n    $$\n    For $F_{hkl}$ to be non-zero, the sum inside the parenthesis must not be zero. This occurs only when the indices $h$, $k$, and $l$ are either all even or all odd (i.e., they have the same parity). If the parities are mixed, the sum is zero.\n    Reflection condition for $F$-lattice: $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd. Reflections are systematically absent if the parities are mixed.\n\n4.  **Body-Centered Lattice ($I$)**:\n    An $I$-centered lattice has lattice points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(1/2,1/2,1/2)$. The structure factor is:\n    $$\n    F_{hkl} = F'_{hkl} \\left( 1 + \\exp[2\\pi i (h/2 + k/2 + l/2)] \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    F_{hkl} = F'_{hkl} \\left( 1 + \\exp[i\\pi(h+k+l)] \\right)\n    $$\n    The term $(1 + \\exp[i\\pi(h+k+l)])$ evaluates to $2$ if the sum $h+k+l$ is an even integer and $0$ if it is an odd integer.\n    Reflection condition for $I$-lattice: $h+k+l=2n$. Reflections are systematically absent if $h+k+l$ is odd.\n\nNow, we evaluate each candidate space group against the provided data. The data consists of $12$ present and $10$ absent reflections. We calculate the score $S = N_{\\text{correct}} / N_{\\text{forbid}}$ for each candidate.\n\n**Candidate 1: $Pmmm$ (Space Group No. 47)**\n- Reflection condition: None. All $(h,k,l)$ are allowed.\n- The rule predicts zero forbidden reflections.\n- $N_{\\text{forbid}} = 0$.\n- By convention, $S_{Pmmm} = 0$.\n\n**Candidate 2: $Cmmm$ (Space Group No. 65)**\n- Reflection condition: $h+k=2n$ (must be even). Forbidden if $h+k$ is odd.\n- We check the full list of $22$ reflections for this condition.\n- Reflections predicted to be forbidden ($h+k$ odd):\n  - From the present list: $(2,1,1)$ since $2+1=3$; $(1,2,3)$ since $1+2=3$.\n  - From the absent list: $(1,0,0)$ since $1+0=1$; $(0,1,0)$ since $0+1=1$; $(1,2,0)$ since $1+2=3$; $(2,1,0)$ since $2+1=3$; $(0,3,1)$ since $0+3=3$; $(3,0,0)$ since $3+0=3$.\n- Total number of reflections predicted to be forbidden: $N_{\\text{forbid}} = 2 (\\text{present}) + 6 (\\text{absent}) = 8$.\n- Number of these that are correctly predicted as absent: $N_{\\text{correct}} = 6$.\n- Score: $S_{Cmmm} = \\frac{N_{\\text{correct}}}{N_{\\text{forbid}}} = \\frac{6}{8} = 0.75$.\n\n**Candidate 3: $Fmmm$ (Space Group No. 69)**\n- Reflection condition: $h, k, l$ all even or all odd. Forbidden for mixed parity.\n- We check the full list for this condition.\n- Reflections predicted to be forbidden (mixed parity):\n  - From the present list: $(1,1,0), (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (2,1,1), (3,1,2), (1,2,3), (3,3,0), (4,0,2), (5,1,0)$. The reflections $(1,1,1)$ (all odd) and $(2,2,2)$ (all even) are allowed. Thus $10$ reflections are forbidden.\n  - From the absent list: All $10$ listed reflections, $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), \\dots, (3,0,0)$, have mixed parity. Thus all $10$ are forbidden.\n- Total number of reflections predicted to be forbidden: $N_{\\text{forbid}} = 10 (\\text{present}) + 10 (\\text{absent}) = 20$.\n- Number of these that are correctly predicted as absent: $N_{\\text{correct}} = 10$.\n- Score: $S_{Fmmm} = \\frac{N_{\\text{correct}}}{N_{\\text{forbid}}} = \\frac{10}{20} = 0.5$.\n\n**Candidate 4: $Immm$ (Space Group No. 71)**\n- Reflection condition: $h+k+l=2n$ (must be even). Forbidden if $h+k+l$ is odd.\n- We check the full list for this condition.\n- Reflections predicted to be forbidden ($h+k+l$ odd):\n  - From the present list: $(1,1,1)$ since $1+1+1=3$. All other present reflections have an even sum.\n  - From the absent list: $(1,0,0)$ sum $1$; $(0,1,0)$ sum $1$; $(0,0,1)$ sum $1$; $(1,2,0)$ sum $3$; $(2,1,0)$ sum $3$; $(2,0,1)$ sum $3$; $(2,2,1)$ sum $5$; $(3,0,0)$ sum $3$. The reflections $(1,1,2)$ (sum $4$) and $(0,3,1)$ (sum $4$) are allowed. Thus $8$ reflections are forbidden.\n- Total number of reflections predicted to be forbidden: $N_{\\text{forbid}} = 1 (\\text{present}) + 8 (\\text{absent}) = 9$.\n- Number of these that are correctly predicted as absent: $N_{\\text{correct}} = 8$.\n- Score: $S_{Immm} = \\frac{N_{\\text{correct}}}{N_{\\text{forbid}}} = \\frac{8}{9}$.\n\nFinally, we rank the candidates by their scores:\n1. $Immm$: $S = 8/9 \\approx 0.889$\n2. $Cmmm$: $S = 6/8 = 0.75$\n3. $Fmmm$: $S = 10/20 = 0.5$\n4. $Pmmm$: $S = 0$\n\nThe candidate with the highest score is $Immm$. This space group provides the most consistent explanation for the observed systematic absences.
