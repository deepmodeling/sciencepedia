It is based on established principles of Fourier optics and sampling theory as applied to optical microscopy. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in satisfying the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem at the image plane of the microscope. The theorem dictates that the sampling frequency, $f_s$, must be at least twice the highest spatial frequency, $f_{max}$, present in the signal being sampled. This condition is expressed as $f_s \\ge 2 f_{max}$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the highest spatial frequency transmitted by the optical system. For a diffraction-limited incoherent imaging system with a circular pupil, the optical transfer function (OTF) is non-zero up to a maximum spatial frequency, known as the cutoff frequency. This cutoff frequency in the object space, $f_{cutoff-obj}$, is given by the formula:\n$$\nf_{cutoff-obj} = \\frac{2 \\cdot NA}{\\lambda}\n$$\nwhere $NA$ is the numerical aperture of the objective lens and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light. The problem specifies that the sampling criterion must be enforced at the shortest transmitted wavelength to ensure adequate sampling across the entire spectral band. This represents the most stringent condition, as shorter wavelengths correspond to higher spatial frequencies. The given shortest wavelength is $\\lambda_{min} = 530\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. Thus, the maximum spatial frequency present in the object information to be imaged is:\n$$\nf_{max-obj} = \\frac{2 \\cdot NA}{\\lambda_{min}}\n$$\n\nNext, we must consider how these spatial frequencies are projected onto the camera sensor. The total magnification of the system, $M$, scales the image. A feature of a certain size in the object plane is magnified by $M$ in the image plane. Consequently, spatial frequencies are scaled by the inverse of the magnification. The maximum spatial frequency present in the image at the sensor plane, $f_{max-img}$, is therefore:\n$$\nf_{max-img} = \\frac{f_{max-obj}}{M} = \\frac{2 \\cdot NA}{M \\cdot \\lambda_{min}}\n$$\n\nThe camera samples this image. The sampling is performed by a grid of pixels. For square pixels with a pitch (center-to-center distance) of $p$, the sampling interval is $p$. The corresponding sampling frequency, $f_s$, is the reciprocal of the sampling interval:\n$$\nf_s = \\frac{1}{p}\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the Nyquist–Shannon sampling criterion, which requires the sampling frequency of the camera to be at least twice the maximum spatial frequency in the image:\n$$\nf_s \\ge 2 \\cdot f_{max-img}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_s$ and $f_{max-img}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} \\ge 2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot NA}{M \\cdot \\lambda_{min}} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} \\ge \\frac{4 \\cdot NA}{M \\cdot \\lambda_{min}}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the minimum total magnification, $M_{min}$, that satisfies this condition.

It provides sufficient information for a unique solution based on fundamental principles of stereology and geometry. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first principle to be applied is the fundamental relationship in stereology for an isotropic microstructure, which connects the grain boundary surface area per unit volume, $S_V$, to the number of point intersections per unit length of a random test line, $N_L$. This relation is:\n$$S_V = 2 N_L$$\nThe quantity $N_L$ is the number of intercepts on the actual specimen, not the image. The total length of the test lines on the specimen, $L_{\\mathrm{spec}}$, is related to the length on the image, $L_{\\mathrm{im}}$, by the magnification $M$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{spec}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{im}}}{M}$$\nThe number of intercepts per unit length, $N_L$, is the total number of intercepts, $N$, divided by the total test line length on the specimen:\n$$N_L = \\frac{N}{L_{\\mathrm{spec}}} = \\frac{N}{L_{\\mathrm{im}}/M} = \\frac{NM}{L_{\\mathrm{im}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the primary stereological equation gives an expression for $S_V$ based on the experimental measurements:\n$$S_V = \\frac{2NM}{L_{\\mathrm{im}}}$$\n\nNext, we derive a second expression for $S_V$ from the geometric model of the grains.
