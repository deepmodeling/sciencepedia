Consider imaging a sample that contains a rectangular trench: the top surface is planar, the trench has vertical sidewalls separated by a width $w$ (measured at the top plane) and a flat bottom at depth $d$ below the top surface. The measured AFM topography at lateral position $x$ is the height of the lowest tip apex position $z(x)$ such that the spherical tip just makes contact with the sample without interpenetration. Assume purely repulsive, non-adhesive contact and that the conical shank does not interfere before the spherical apex does. Separately, in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at small bias, the tunneling current $I$ under the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation obeys $I \\propto \\exp(-2 \\kappa z)$ with $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2 m \\phi}/\\hbar$, where $m$ is the electron mass, $\\phi$ is the effective barrier height, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant; in constant-current mode the feedback adjusts $z(x)$ to maintain a setpoint current as the tip scans.\n\nUsing only the above first-principles geometrical non-penetration for AFM and the exponential distance dependence for STM, analyze how a finite tip radius broadens apparent feature sizes and alters the measured depth of narrow trenches. In your analysis, treat the AFM apex as a sphere of radius $R$ and the STM tip as locally sharp but with a finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ for tunneling.

A necessary and sufficient condition for the AFM spherical apex to reach and trace the trench bottom is $w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}$ (for $d \\le 2 R$); equivalently, if this is not satisfied the apex never reaches the bottom and the measured depth is tip-limited.\n\nD. In STM constant-current imaging, if the apex is atomically sharp so that $R \\to 0$, the apparent trench depth equals the true depth $d$ because tunneling current arises only from the nearest point directly beneath the apex and has no lateral spread.\n\nE. In STM constant-current imaging, even with a very sharp apex, the finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ causes lateral collection of tunneling current from the trench sidewalls; the feedback therefore reduces the apparent trench depth below $d$ for sufficiently narrow trenches, constituting an effective tip convolution distinct from purely geometrical dilation.\n\nF. In AFM tapping mode, intermittent contact eliminates tip convolution, so the apparent trench width and depth are equal to $w$ and $d$ regardless of $R$.\n\nG. For $R = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $w = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $d = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the AFM maximum apparent depth at the center is approximately $0.84\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and the apex does not reach the trench bottom.", "solution": "The AFM imaging process in contact mode can be formalized as a non-penetration problem: the measured height profile is the lower envelope of tip apex positions that do not intersect the sample. Modeling the apex as a sphere of radius $R$, the envelope construction is the same as a morphological dilation of the sample by the tip shape. For a rectangular trench with vertical walls and a flat bottom, the limiting descent of the spherical apex at the trench center occurs when the sphere simultaneously touches both upper edges; beyond that point, any further descent would interpenetrate the sidewalls.\n\nTo derive the tip-limited maximum descent at the trench center, place the top surface at $z = 0$ and the trench center at $x = 0$. The vertical walls lie at $x = \\pm w/2$, extending down from $z = 0$. Let the sphere center be at $(x,z) = (0, z_{c})$ and its apex (lowest point) at $z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = z_{c} - R$. The sphere just touching the two top edges at $(x,z) = (\\pm w/2, 0)$ implies that these edge points lie on the spherical surface. Therefore the condition for simultaneous contact is\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (0 - z_{c})^{2} = R^{2},$$\nso that\n$$z_{c} = \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}.$$\nThe corresponding apex height relative to the top surface is\n$$z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = z_{c} - R = -\\left(R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right).$$\nThus, the maximum descent of the apex below the top plane without interpenetration is\n$$\\Delta z_{\\max}(w,R) = R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}},$$\nprovided $w \\le 2 R$ so that the square root is real. The apparent depth at the trench center is the smaller of this tip-limited descent and the true depth $d$,\n$$d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max}(w,R,d) = \\min\\!\\left(d,\\, R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right).$$\nIf $w > 2 R$, the sidewalls no longer constrain the sphere and the apex can in principle reach the bottom; in that case the measured depth is $d$ (modulo shank interference, which we neglect by assumption).\n\nFor $w \\ll R$, expand the square root using $\\sqrt{1 - x} \\approx 1 - x/2$ for small $x$ with $x = (w/2R)^{2}$. One obtains\n$$R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}} = R \\left[1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{w}{2R}\\right)^{2}}\\right] \\approx R \\left[1 - \\left(1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\tfrac{w}{2R}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{w^{2}}{8 R}.$$\nConsequently, when $d \\gg w^{2}/(8 R)$ the apparent depth is $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$, independent of $d$.\n\nThe condition for the apex to reach the trench bottom is that, when the apex is at the bottom ($z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = -d$, i.e., $z_{c} = R - d$), the sphere does not intersect the sidewalls at the top edges. Non-intersection at $(\\pm w/2, 0)$ requires these edge points to be outside or on the sphere:\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (0 - z_{c})^{2} \\ge R^{2}.$$\nSubstituting $z_{c} = R - d$ yields\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (R - d)^{2} \\ge R^{2} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; (w/2)^{2} \\ge 2 R d - d^{2}.$$\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the apex to reach the bottom is\n$$w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}, \\quad \\text{for } d \\le 2 R.$$\nIf this inequality is violated, the apex cannot reach the bottom; the measured depth is tip-limited by the geometric constraint derived above.\n\nTurning to Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), the constant-current topography $z(x)$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the integrated tunneling current between the tip and the sample equals the setpoint. In the simplest local approximation, the tunneling current from any local point separated by a gap $z$ obeys $I \\propto \\exp(-2 \\kappa z)$ with $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2 m \\phi}/\\hbar$. Crucially, this dependence is not strictly local in lateral extent: nearby regions at similar $z$ contribute comparably if they are within a lateral distance where the vacuum gap to the tip is not much larger. Over a trench with vertical sidewalls, even an atomically sharp apex ($R \\to 0$) at the trench center receives significant current from the sidewalls because their shortest separation to the apex is only slightly larger than the vertical gap; as the tip descends, the sidewall contributions increase rapidly due to the exponential law, causing the feedback to retract the tip to maintain the setpoint. Hence, the apparent trench depth is reduced below the true $d$ for sufficiently narrow $w$. This broadening mechanism is intrinsically electronic (set by $\\kappa$) and persists even for $R \\to 0$, distinguishing it from purely geometrical dilation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This is exactly the geometrical non-penetration result derived above. The maximum apparent depth at the center is limited by simultaneous contact with both edges, giving $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max}(w,R,d) = \\min\\!\\left(d,\\, R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right)$ for $w \\le 2 R$, and reduces to $d$ when $w > 2 R$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Using the small-argument expansion for $w \\ll R$, we found $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$ provided the true depth $d$ exceeds this tip-limited value. This is independent of $d$ in that regime. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. We derived the reach-bottom criterion $w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}$ (for $d \\le 2 R$). Failure of this inequality implies the apex cannot reach the bottom and the measured depth is limited by the tip geometry. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. The statement assumes perfect locality of tunneling, which contradicts the exponential distance dependence that gives finite lateral collection of current. Even for $R \\to 0$, nearby sidewalls contribute because their separation is only slightly larger than the vertical gap, so the apparent depth is not guaranteed to equal $d$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This option correctly identifies that the finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ causes lateral averaging of the tunneling current and reduces the apparent depth in narrow trenches even for an atomically sharp tip. This is an electronic convolution distinct from pure geometric dilation. Verdict: Correct.\n\nF. Tapping (amplitude-modulation) AFM reduces shear and adhesion but does not remove the geometric constraint set by the finite apex radius; intermittent contact cannot make the apex narrower. Tip convolution remains, so apparent widths and depths depend on $R$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nG. Using $R = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $w = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $d = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, compute\n$$R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} - \\sqrt{(10\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2} - (4\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} - \\sqrt{100 - 16}\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} - \\sqrt{84}\\,\\mathrm{nm}.$$\nSince $\\sqrt{84} \\approx 9.165$, the tip-limited descent is $\\approx 0.835\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient data for a quantitative and qualitative analysis. Each observation and its proposed explanation must be critically evaluated.\n\nEvaluation of Option A:\nThis option pertains to Observation 1, which describes periodic ripples in an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) height image. The core of the diagnosis is a feedback-induced oscillation. A fixed temporal oscillation of frequency $f$ in the $z$-axis position of the tip will be imprinted onto the image as a spatial periodic feature along the fast-scan direction. The spatial period (wavelength) $\\lambda$ of this feature is related to the fast-scan velocity $v_{\\mathrm{fast}}$ by the fundamental relation $\\lambda = v_{\\mathrm{fast}} \\cdot T = v_{\\mathrm{fast}} / f$, where $T$ is the period of the oscillation. The observation states that when $v_{\\mathrm{fast}}$ is doubled, $\\lambda$ also doubles. This is perfectly consistent with the equation $\\lambda = (1/f) \\cdot v_{\\mathrm{fast}}$, as it implies that $f$ is a constant property of the instrument's feedback loop, independent of the scan speed.\n\nLet us perform a quantitative check. The problem provides $v_{\\mathrm{fast}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m/s} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and an observed ripple period of $\\lambda \\approx 100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

The calculated frequency matches the independently measured loop oscillation frequency, providing strong quantitative support for this diagnosis.\nFurthermore, the observation that reducing the proportional gain of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller reduces the ripple amplitude is a classic characteristic of feedback loop oscillations. Higher gains can reduce the phase margin of a control loop, leading to underdamped behavior or instability, which manifests as oscillation or \"ringing\" at the system's resonant frequency. Reducing the gain increases damping and suppresses these oscillations. All aspects of the observation are consistent with the diagnosis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option B:\nThis option addresses Observation 2, which describes transient image distortion after a change in scan size. The proposed cause is piezoelectric scanner creep. Piezoelectric materials, such as the PZT (lead zirconate titanate) used in most SPM scanners, exhibit a slow, non-exponential relaxation in their displacement following a step change in the applied electric field. This phenomenon is known as creep. When the scan size is changed, a large step voltage is applied to the scanner actuators to change their DC offset. The scanner's position does not respond instantaneously but continues to slowly drift (creep) toward its final position over a period of seconds to minutes. The problem states that the distortion diminishes over successive frames with a time dependence that is \"logarithmic with $t$ on a characteristic timescale of order $10\\,\\mathrm{s}$\". This logarithmic time dependence, $\\Delta x(t) \\propto \\log(t)$, is the empirically established and commonly used model for piezoelectric creep. The specified timescale of order $10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is also typical for these materials. This slow positional drift causes a geometric distortion in the image that gradually resolves as the scanner settles. The description is a textbook example of piezoelectric creep.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option C:\nThis option concerns Observation 3, which reports a long-term drift of $\\Delta x \\approx +30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\Delta y \\approx -10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ over a period of $5\\,\\mathrm{min}$. The option claims this is inconsistent with thermal drift. Let us verify this claim. The relationship between thermal expansion $\\Delta L$, the material's linear thermal expansion coefficient $\\alpha$, the characteristic structural length $L$, and the temperature change $\\Delta T$ is $\\Delta L = \\alpha L \\Delta T$. The rate of drift is therefore $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\Delta L)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\alpha L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\nWe are given $L \\approx 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\alpha \\approx 2\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$. The total observation time is $t = 5\\,\\mathrm{min} = 300\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The drift rate in the $x$-direction is approximately constant at $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{300\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{nm/s} = 1 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. We can now calculate the required rate of temperature change to produce this drift:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha L} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\Delta L)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{(2\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.1\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-10}}{2 \\times 10^{-7}}\\,\\mathrm{K/s} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K/s} = 0.0005\\,\\mathrm{K/s} $$\nThis rate of temperature change corresponds to $0.0005\\,\\mathrm{K/s} \\times 60\\,\\mathrm{s/min} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{K/min}$, or $1.8\\,\\mathrm{K/hour}$. Such a small, steady temperature change is entirely plausible in a standard laboratory environment, even one with air conditioning. The option claims this observation requires a temperature drift on the order of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{K/s}$, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the correctly calculated value. A rate of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{K/s}$ is indeed unrealistically large, but it is derived from a flawed calculation. The observation is, in fact, quantitatively consistent with a realistic level of thermal drift. Therefore, the conclusion that \"thermal drift cannot explain the observation\" is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nEvaluation of Option D:\nThis option analyzes Observation 4, where a high-frequency texture in the height channel is correlated with the lateral deflection signal. The proposed cause is electronic cross-talk. Cross-talk occurs when a signal from one electronic channel leaks into another, typically through capacitive or inductive coupling between wires or PCB traces. The observation of high correlation at frequencies near $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is a strong indicator of mains hum (from the $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ or $60\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ AC power lines) coupling into the system, which is a very common source of electronic noise. The fact that mitigation is achieved by changing cable routing and reducing the detection bandwidth confirms the electronic nature of the artifact. Altering cable paths changes the stray capacitance/inductance responsible for coupling. Reducing bandwidth applies a low-pass filter, which would attenuate a $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ signal.\nThe most definitive piece of evidence is that reversing the scan direction does not invert the sign of the imprint. Mechanical artifacts, such as those related to tip-sample friction measured in the lateral deflection channel, typically invert their sign upon scan reversal. Electronic cross-talk, being a property of the circuitry, is independent of the mechanical scan direction. The observation perfectly matches this expectation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option E:\nThis option interprets Observation 5, describing artifacts in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) on an insulating domain. The proposed diagnosis is sample charging. When tunneling electrons are removed from (or added to) a poorly conductive surface, charge can accumulate locally. This accumulated charge creates a local surface potential $V_s$, which modifies the tunneling conditions.\nCase 1: Tip bias is $+2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Electrons tunnel from the sample to the tip, leaving behind positive charge (holes or ionized sites). This creates a positive surface potential, $V_s > 0$. The potential difference driving the tunneling current is effectively reduced to $V_{bias} - V_s$. This causes the tunneling current to decay as more charge accumulates along the scan line. The feedback loop must then move the tip closer to the sample (extend the $z$-piezo) to restore the current setpoint, which appears as a brightening artifact. This matches the observation.\nCase 2: Tip bias is reversed to $-2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The effect is reported to reverse. Electrons tunnel from the tip to the sample, accumulating as negative charge and creating a negative surface potential, $V_s  0$. This accumulated charge causes upward band bending at the surface, which can increase the density of available electronic states for tunneling near the Fermi level. An increased density of states would lead to an *increase* in tunneling current along the scan line. To maintain the setpoint, the feedback loop must retract the tip, causing an apparent darkening. This constitutes a reversal of the effect observed at positive bias.\nThe final piece of evidence, that illumination with above-bandgap light \"resets\" the effect, is a classic test for charging. The photons generate electron-hole pairs, increasing the local conductivity and allowing the accumulated surface charge to dissipate. All described signatures are hallmarks of sample charging phenomena.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nEvaluation of Option F:\nThis option presents an alternative explanation for Observation 1, attributing the periodic ripples to uniform thermal drift. This is physically unsound. Thermal drift is a slow, low-frequency process, typically manifesting as a continuous, monotonic shift in position over time scales of minutes to hours. It cannot be the source of a periodic oscillation with a frequency on the order of $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, as calculated in the analysis of Option A. Furthermore, the option's reasoning that the ripples \"persist when the scan speed is changed\" is a misinterpretation. The observation is that the *spatial period* $\\lambda$ of the ripples scales linearly with scan speed $v_{\\mathrm{fast}}$. This behavior is the definitive sign of a constant *temporal* frequency source, which is inconsistent with thermal drift but perfectly consistent with an electronic or mechanical oscillation. Therefore, the ripples cannot be attributed to thermal drift.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2519901"}]}
