It is a well-posed problem in classical mechanics applied to atomic force microscopy, founded on scientifically sound principles. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of an AFM cantilever tip interacting with a planar sample surface. We are asked to find the critical tip-sample separation $z_c$ at which the cantilever becomes mechanically unstable and \"snaps in\" to contact with the surface during a quasi-static approach.\n\nLet the position of the sample surface be the origin, $z=0$. The instantaneous position of the AFM tip is at a separation $z > 0$. The cantilever is modeled as an ideal linear spring of stiffness $k$. The position of the cantilever base, which is controlled by a piezoelectric actuator, is denoted by $Z$. In the absence of any tip-sample interaction forces, the tip would be at its equilibrium position $z=Z$. Therefore, a deviation of the tip to a position $z$ from its would-be rest position $Z$ results in a deflection of $(z-Z)$. The elastic potential energy stored in the cantilever is given by Hooke's law:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{el}}(z; Z) = \\frac{1}{2}k(z-Z)^2$$\nThe semicolon in $U_{\\mathrm{el}}(z; Z)$ indicates that the energy is a function of the variable $z$, with $Z$ acting as a control parameter.\n\nThe tip-sample interaction is described by a non-retarded van der Waals potential, given as:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{ts}}(z) = -\\frac{AR}{6z}$$\nwhere $A$ is the Hamaker constant and $R$ is the radius of the tip apex.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, $U_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the elastic and interaction energies. It is a function of the tip position $z$ for a given cantilever base position $Z$.\n$$U_{\\mathrm{total}}(z; Z) = U_{\\mathrm{el}}(z; Z) + U_{\\mathrm{ts}}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}k(z-Z)^2 - \\frac{AR}{6z}$$\nFor a fixed base position $Z$, the tip will reside at a position $z$ that corresponds to a stable equilibrium. An equilibrium position is a stationary point of the total potential energy, meaning the net force on the tip is zero. The force is the negative gradient of the potential energy. Thus, the equilibrium condition is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\partial z} = 0$$\nCalculating the first derivative of $U_{\\mathrm{total}}$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}k(z-Z)^2 - \\frac{AR}{6z} \\right) = k(z-Z) - (-\\frac{AR}{6z^2}) = k(z-Z) + \\frac{AR}{6z^2}$$\nSetting this to zero gives the equation for the equilibrium separation(s) $z$ for a given $Z$:\n$$k(z-Z) + \\frac{AR}{6z^2} = 0$$\n\nFor an equilibrium to be mechanically stable, it must correspond to a local minimum of the potential energy. A necessary condition for a local minimum is that the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to the position coordinate must be positive.\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\partial z^2} > 0$$\nThe mechanical instability, or \"snap-in\", occurs at the critical point where a stable equilibrium is about to vanish. This happens when the local minimum of the potential energy function flattens and becomes an inflection point. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the second derivative equals zero. Let $z_c$ be the critical separation at which this instability occurs.\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\partial z^2} \\right|_{z=z_c} = 0$$\nWe now compute the second derivative of $U_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( k(z-Z) + \\frac{AR}{6z^2} \\right) = k + \\frac{AR}{6} \\frac{d}{dz}(z^{-2}) = k + \\frac{AR}{6}(-2z^{-3}) = k - \\frac{2AR}{6z^3}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 U_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\partial z^2} = k - \\frac{AR}{3z^3}$$\nNote that the second derivative, which determines the local curvature of the potential landscape and thus the stability, is independent of the cantilever base position $Z$. The instability condition is therefore an intrinsic property determined by the balance between the cantilever stiffness and the gradient of the interaction force.\n\nSetting the second derivative to zero at the critical separation $z_c$:\n$$k - \\frac{AR}{3z_c^3} = 0$$\nWe now solve this equation for $z_c$.\n$$k = \\frac{AR}{3z_c^3}$$\n$$z_c^3 = \\frac{AR}{3k}$$\nTaking the cube root of both sides yields the final expression for the critical separation:\n$$z_c = \\left(\\frac{AR}{3k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nThis is the exact closed-form expression for the tip-sample separation at the point of snap-in instability, expressed solely in terms of the given physical parameters $A$, $R$, and $k$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{AR}{3k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}}$$", "id": "2468693"}, {"introduction": "To transform raw photodiode voltage into a quantitative force measurement, an accurate calibration of the cantilever's deflection sensitivity is essential.

The provided data are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. We proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a linear relationship between the photodiode voltage $V$ and the piezo displacement $z$, described by the model $V_i = m z_i + b + \\varepsilon_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$. Here, $m$ is the slope (deflection sensitivity), $b$ is the intercept, and $\\varepsilon_i$ are independent, identically distributed random errors with mean $E[\\varepsilon_i] = 0$ and known variance $\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma_V^2$. The values of the independent variable $z_i$ are treated as known constants without uncertainty. Under these assumptions, the ordinary least squares (OLS) method provides the best linear unbiased estimators for $m$ and $b$.\n\nFirst, we derive the OLS estimator for the slope, $\\hat{m}$. The OLS estimates are found by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S(m, b) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (V_i - m z_i - b)^2$, with respect to $m$ and $b$.

In the contact region of the force curve, the change in piezo position $\\Delta z$ is equal to the change in cantilever deflection $\\Delta x$. The photodiode voltage is assumed to be a linear function of cantilever deflection, $V = kx + V_0$. Thus, $V$ is a linear function of $z$ in this region, and the slope $m$ of the $V$ vs. $z$ plot is precisely the deflection sensitivity $k$ in units of $\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $\\hat{m}$ using the provided data:\n$N = 1001$\n$\\sum z_i = 25025\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n$\\sum z_i^2 = 834583.75\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$\n$\\sum V_i = 1101.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$\\sum z_i V_i = 35885.85\\,\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nFirst, we compute the sample means:\n$\\bar{z} = \\frac{\\sum z_i}{N} = \\frac{25025}{1001} = 25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n$\\bar{V} = \\frac{\\sum V_i}{N} = \\frac{1101.1}{1001} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nNow we compute the numerator and denominator for $\\hat{m}$:\nNumerator: $\\sum z_i V_i - N\\bar{z}\\bar{V} = 35885.85 - (1001)(25)(1.1) = 35885.85 - 27527.5 = 8358.35\\,\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm}$\nDenominator: $\\sum (z_i - \\bar{z})^2 = \\sum z_i^2 - N\\bar{z}^2 = 834583.75 - (1001)(25^2) = 834583.75 - 625625 = 208958.75\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$\n\nSo, the slope estimate is:\n$$\n\\hat{m} = \\frac{8358.35}{208958.75} = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThe fact that this calculation yields an exact rational number suggests the problem data was constructed from a noise-free model, likely $V_i = 0.04 z_i + 0.1$. The noise $\\varepsilon_i$ represents the stochastic uncertainty in the measurement process, not systematic deviation from the model.\n\nNext, we derive the standard uncertainty of $\\hat{m}$, denoted $u_{\\hat{m}}$.
