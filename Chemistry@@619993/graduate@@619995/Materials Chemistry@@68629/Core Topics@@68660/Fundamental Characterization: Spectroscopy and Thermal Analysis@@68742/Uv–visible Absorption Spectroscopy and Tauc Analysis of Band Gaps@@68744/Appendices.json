It is therefore valid. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an approximate relationship for the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$ of a semiconductor slab and its subsequent numerical calculation. The derivation must start from the principles of exponential attenuation and Fresnel reflectance.\n\nLet a beam of light with initial intensity $I_0$ be incident normal to the surface of a plane-parallel slab of thickness $d$ and complex refractive index $\\tilde{n} = n + ik$. The surrounding medium is air, with a refractive index that we approximate as $n_{air} = 1$.\n\nFirst, we determine the reflectance $R$ at the air-slab interface. For normal incidence, the Fresnel equation for reflectance is:\n$$R = \\left| \\frac{\\tilde{n} - n_{air}}{\\tilde{n} + n_{air}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{(n-1)^2 + k^2}{(n+1)^2 + k^2}$$\nThe problem states that the extinction coefficient $k$ is negligible compared to the real part of the refractive index $n$ at the photon energy of interest. Thus, we can approximate $k \\approx 0$ in the expression for $R$.\n$$R \\approx \\left( \\frac{n-1}{n+1} \\right)^2$$\nUsing the given value $n = 1.90$:\n$$R = \\left( \\frac{1.90 - 1.00}{1.90 + 1.00} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{0.90}{2.90} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.0963134$$\n\nWhen the light beam of intensity $I_0$ strikes the front surface, a fraction $R$ is reflected, and a fraction $(1-R)$ is transmitted into the slab. The intensity just inside the front surface is $I_{in} = I_0(1-R)$.\n\nThis transmitted beam then propagates through the slab of thickness $d$. According to the principle of exponential attenuation (the Beer-Lambert law), its intensity decreases to $I(d) = I_{in} \\exp(-\\alpha d)$, where $\\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient. The intensity just before reaching the rear surface is $I_0(1-R)\\exp(-\\alpha d)$.\n\nAt the rear slab-air interface, the beam is again partitioned. A fraction $(1-R)$ is transmitted out of the slab, and a fraction $R$ is reflected back into it. The problem states that coherent interference is suppressed due to low instrumental coherence and film thickness. This means we must sum the intensities of the successive beams emerging from the slab, not their complex amplitudes.\n\nThe intensity of the first transmitted beam is:\n$$I_1 = [I_0(1-R)\\exp(-\\alpha d)](1-R) = I_0(1-R)^2 \\exp(-\\alpha d)$$\n\nThe portion of the beam reflected at the rear interface, with intensity $I_0(1-R)R\\exp(-\\alpha d)$, travels back to the front surface, is attenuated again, reflects off the front interface (with reflectance $R$), travels back to the rear surface, and is attenuated a third time before a fraction is transmitted. Each round trip within the slab results in an intensity reduction factor of $R^2\\exp(-2\\alpha d)$. The total transmitted intensity $I_T$ is the sum of a geometric series:\n$$I_T = I_1 + I_1[R^2\\exp(-2\\alpha d)] + I_1[R^2\\exp(-2\\alpha d)]^2 + \\dots$$\n$$I_T = I_1 \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} [R^2\\exp(-2\\alpha d)]^j = \\frac{I_1}{1 - R^2\\exp(-2\\alpha d)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_1$ and dividing by $I_0$ gives the exact expression for the total incoherent transmittance $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{I_T}{I_0} = \\frac{(1-R)^2 \\exp(-\\alpha d)}{1 - R^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha d)}$$\n\nThe problem requests a leading-order approximation. This approximation is based on neglecting the contributions from all multiple internal reflections. This is physically equivalent to considering only the first transmitted beam, $I_1$. Mathematically, this corresponds to the case where the term $R^2\\exp(-2\\alpha d)$ in the denominator is much smaller than $1$, allowing a Taylor expansion $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1+x$ where we only keep the first term, $1$.\nThe approximation is explicitly stated as: We neglect all multiply reflected beams, assuming their contribution to the total transmittance is small.\nThis leads to the simplified relation:\n$$T \\approx (1-R)^2 \\exp(-\\alpha d)$$\nTo find the absorption coefficient $\\alpha$, we rearrange this expression:\n$$\\exp(-\\alpha d) \\approx \\frac{T}{(1-R)^2}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\alpha d \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{(1-R)^2}\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx -\\frac{1}{d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{(1-R)^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{(1-R)^2}{T}\\right)$$\nThis is the required derived relationship.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $\\alpha$.
