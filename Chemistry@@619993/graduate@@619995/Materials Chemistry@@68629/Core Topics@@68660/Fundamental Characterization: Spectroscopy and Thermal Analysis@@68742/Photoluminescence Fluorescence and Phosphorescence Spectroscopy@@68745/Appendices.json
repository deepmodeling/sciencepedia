It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the first-order kinetic model for the population of the excited singlet state, $N(t)$. The rate of change of this population is governed by the sum of all deactivation rates.\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -(k_{r} + k_{nr})N(t)\n$$\nThe total decay rate constant is defined as $k_{tot} = k_{r} + k_{nr}$. The differential equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k_{tot} N(t)\n$$\nSolving this first-order linear ordinary differential equation for an initial population $N(0)=N_{0}$ yields the exponential decay law:\n$$\nN(t) = N_{0} \\exp(-k_{tot} t)\n$$\nThe fluorescence lifetime, $\\tau$, is defined as the mean survival time of the excited state population. For a single-exponential decay, this is equivalent to the time required for the population to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value. From the solution above, this occurs when the argument of the exponential is $-1$.\n$$\nk_{tot} \\tau = 1 \\implies \\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{tot}} = \\frac{1}{k_{r} + k_{nr}}\n$$\nThis provides the first fundamental relationship between the lifetime and the rate constants.\n\nThe photoluminescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_{f}$, is defined as the fraction of excited molecules that return to the ground state via radiative emission. This is equivalent to the ratio of the rate of the radiative process to the total rate of all deactivation processes.\n$$\n\\Phi_{f} = \\frac{\\text{rate of radiative decay}}{\\text{total rate of decay}} = \\frac{k_{r} N(t)}{(k_{r} + k_{nr}) N(t)} = \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{r} + k_{nr}}\n$$\nThis provides the second fundamental relationship.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $k_{r}$ and $k_{nr}$:\n1. $\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{r} + k_{nr}}$\n2. $\\Phi_{f} = \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{r} + k_{nr}}$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express the total decay rate as $k_{r} + k_{nr} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}$.\nSubstituting this into equation (2) gives:\n$$\n\\Phi_{f} = \\frac{k_{r}}{1/\\tau} = k_{r} \\tau\n$$\nSolving for $k_{r}$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nk_{r} = \\frac{\\Phi_{f}}{\\tau}\n$$\nTo find $k_{nr}$, we rearrange the expression for the total decay rate: $k_{nr} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} - k_{r}$.

These motions facilitate internal conversion (IC) by allowing the excited-state potential energy surface to intersect with a high-lying vibrational level of the ground state, thus dissipating energy as heat. In a liquid solvent like ethanol, the dye molecule has considerable motional freedom. When the dye is transferred to a rigid, low-mobility host matrix, these intramolecular rotations and large-amplitude vibrations are sterically hindered and suppressed. The restriction of these motions effectively closes or slows down major nonradiative decay channels. Consequently, the nonradiative decay rate constant $k_{nr}$ is expected to **decrease** substantially.\n\n2.  **Effect on the Radiative Rate Constant ($k_{r}$):** The radiative rate constant $k_{r}$ is an intrinsic property related to the transition dipole moment of the S$_{1} \\rightarrow$ S$_{0}$ transition. However, it is also modulated by the dielectric environment, specifically the refractive index, $n$, of the surrounding medium. Theories of spontaneous emission in a dielectric medium (e.g., using local-field corrections) show that $k_{r}$ is a function of $n$. For instance, a common simple relation is $k_{r} \\propto n^{2}$. The problem explicitly states that the host matrix has a refractive index **comparable** to that of ethanol ($n_{\\text{ethanol}} \\approx 1.36$). By controlling for this variable, the major extrinsic factor affecting $k_{r}$ is eliminated. While minor changes to $k_{r}$ could occur due to slight conformational changes or specific molecule-matrix electronic interactions, these effects are typically secondary. Therefore, to a first approximation, the radiative rate constant $k_{r}$ is expected to remain **largely unchanged**.\n\nIn summary, the transition from a liquid solvent to a rigid matrix of similar refractive index primarily impacts the nonradiative decay channels. The expected outcome is a significant decrease in $k_{nr}$ with a minimal change in $k_{r}$. This would lead to a higher photoluminescence quantum yield ($\\Phi_{f} = k_{r} / (k_{r} + k_{nr})$) and a longer fluorescence lifetime ($\\tau = 1 / (k_{r} + k_{nr})$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.00 \\times 10^{8} & 1.86 \\times 10^{8} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2509388"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the kinetics of decay, the energy landscape of a molecule dictates the color of its light emission.

The system is modeled under the common assumption of a spatially uniform carrier distribution in an optically thin film, where the temporal evolution of the excess carrier density, denoted by $n(t)$, is governed by an ordinary differential equation. The total recombination rate, $R(n)$, is the sum of three independent processes: monomolecular (defect-assisted or Shockley-Read-Hall), bimolecular (radiative), and trimolecular (Auger) recombination. This leads to the governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = -R(n) = -\\left(A n(t) + B n(t)^2 + C n(t)^3\\right)\n$$\nHere, $A$ (in units of $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), $B$ (in units of $\\mathrm{cm^3\\,s^{-1}}$), and $C$ (in units of $\\mathrm{cm^6\\,s^{-1}}$) are the positive-definite rate coefficients for the respective recombination channels. The initial condition is given by the photo-generated carrier density at time $t=0$, which is $n(0) = n_0$.\n\nThe experimental observable is the photoluminescence intensity, $I(t)$. It is assumed to be directly proportional to the rate of the radiative bimolecular recombination process. With a detection constant of unity, the intensity is given by:\n$$\nI(t) = B n(t)^2\n$$\nThe core task is to determine the unknown parameters $(A, B, C)$ from a set of synthetic TRPL decay traces generated at several distinct initial carrier densities $n_0$. The use of multiple initial densities is critical, as the relative contributions of the three recombination terms ($An$, $Bn^2$, $Cn^3$) scale differently with carrier density. Monomolecular recombination dominates at low $n$, bimolecular at intermediate $n$, and Auger at high $n$. A global fit across datasets spanning a wide range of $n_0$ values is therefore necessary to robustly disentangle and quantify the three coefficients.\n\nThe solution is implemented as a numerical procedure. First, a forward model is constructed to predict the TRPL signal for a given set of parameters $(A, B, C)$ and initial conditions. This requires numerically solving the initial value problem for the carrier density ODE. We employ the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function, which implements an adaptive-step Runge-Kutta method, to obtain the solution $n(t)$ on the specified time grid, which must be converted from nanoseconds to seconds for consistency with the units of the rate coefficients. From $n(t)$, the model intensity $I_{\\text{model}}(t) = B n(t)^2$ is calculated.\n\nThe parameter inference is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. The goal is to find the parameter set $(A, B, C)$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals between the model predictions and the synthetic data.

A crucial step is the normalization of the residuals for each trace by its maximum intensity, $\\max_{j} I_{\\text{data},k}(t_j)$. This ensures that data from all injection levels, including low-intensity traces from low $n_0$, contribute meaningfully to the fit, preventing the result from being dominated by the high-intensity signals at high $n_0$. The minimization is performed using `scipy.optimize.least_squares` with the Trust Region Reflective algorithm, which efficiently handles the physical constraint that the rate coefficients must be non-negative ($A \\geq 0$, $B \\geq 0$, $C \\geq 0$).\n\nSynthetic data for each test case is generated by first solving the ODE with the known true parameters $(A_{\\text{true}}, B_{\\text{true}}, C_{\\text{true}})$ to obtain the noiseless intensity traces. Then, zero-mean Gaussian noise is added. The standard deviation of the noise is set to $1\\%$ of the maximum intensity for that trace, and a fixed random seed is used to ensure reproducibility.\n\nFinally, after the best-fit parameters $(A_{\\text{fit}}, B_{\\text{fit}}, C_{\\text{fit}})$ are determined, the fractional contribution of the monomolecular (defect) recombination channel to the total initial recombination rate is calculated for the lowest initial carrier density, $n_{0,\\text{low}} = 10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. This quantity, $f_{\\text{defect}}$, is a key metric for material quality and is calculated as:\n$$\nf_{\\text{defect}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{fit}} n_{0,\\text{low}}}{A_{\\text{fit}} n_{0,\\text{low}} + B_{\\text{fit}} n_{0,\\text{low}}^2 + C_{\\text{fit}} n_{0,\\text{low}}^3}\n$$\nThe entire procedure is executed for each defined test case, and the resulting fitted coefficients and calculated $f_{\\text{defect}}$ values are formatted and reported as specified.", "answer": "[5.039e+06,1.006e-10,1.088e-29,8.324e-01,1.002e+07,2.003e-10,5.048e-29,3.333e-01,1.002e+06,1.000e-10,5.001e-28,9.073e-02]", "id": "2509350"}]}
