Angles are given in degrees.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the thickness, $d$, of a uniform overlayer on a substrate using Angle-Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARXPS). The solution must be derived from the fundamental principles of electron attenuation in solids.\n\nLet us begin by establishing the mathematical model for the intensities of photoelectrons originating from the substrate and the overlayer. The intensity of a photoelectron signal is attenuated as it traverses a material. According to the Beer-Lambert law, the probability of an electron traveling a distance $x$ without an inelastic scattering event is $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of the electron in the medium.\n\nFor an electron emitted at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the surface normal, the path length through an overlayer of thickness $d$ is given by $d/\\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe intensity of the signal from the substrate, $I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\theta)$, is the intensity from an infinitely thick, clean substrate, $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}}$, attenuated by the overlayer.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\theta) = I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda \\cos\\theta}\\right)$$\nHere, $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ is a constant that incorporates instrumental factors, photo-ionization cross-section, and atomic concentration for the substrate. The problem states that $\\lambda$ is the same for electrons from both the substrate and the overlayer.\n\nThe intensity of the signal from the overlayer, $I_{\\mathrm{ovl}}(\\theta)$, is the signal that would be obtained from an infinitely thick sample of the overlayer material, $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{ovl}}$, but reduced because the layer has a finite thickness $d$. The signal is generated throughout the depth of the overlayer, and electrons from a depth $z$ are attenuated by the material above them. Integrating over the thickness of the overlayer from $z=0$ (surface) to $z=d$ (interface) yields:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ovl}}(\\theta) = I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{ovl}} \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda \\cos\\theta}\\right)\\right]$$\nHere, $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{ovl}}$ is a constant analogous to $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ for the overlayer material.\n\nThe terms $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ and $I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{ovl}}$ are unknown. To eliminate them, we must use the ratios of the measured intensities. Let us define the ratio of the substrate intensity to the overlayer intensity at a given angle $\\theta$:\n$$R(\\theta) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{sub}}(\\theta)}{I_{\\mathrm{ovl}}(\\theta)} = \\frac{I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda \\cos\\theta}\\right)}{I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{ovl}} \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda \\cos\\theta}\\right)\\right]}$$\nLet $C = I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{sub}}/I^{\\infty}_{\\mathrm{ovl}}$ be the ratio of the sensitivity factors, which is an unknown constant.

This is the \"true\" chemical effect related to changes in valence electron density and bonding.\n\nThe final-state contribution, $\\Delta E_{fs}$, arises from the difference in the relaxation energy of the surrounding electrons that screen the core hole created during photoemission. The binding energy, $E_{B}$, is given by the difference between the final-state energy $E_{f}$ (one core hole) and the initial-state energy $E_{i}$ (ground state). Relaxation lowers the final-state energy, thereby decreasing the measured binding energy. Using Koopmans' theorem as a reference, the binding energy is $E_{B} = E_{B}^{\\mathrm{Koopmans}} - R$, where $E_{B}^{\\mathrm{Koopmans}}$ represents the initial-state orbital energy and $R$ is the positive-definite relaxation energy.

A change in the initial-state potential, $\\Delta V$, shifts all core levels by roughly the same amount, so $\\Delta E_{is} \\approx \\Delta V$.
