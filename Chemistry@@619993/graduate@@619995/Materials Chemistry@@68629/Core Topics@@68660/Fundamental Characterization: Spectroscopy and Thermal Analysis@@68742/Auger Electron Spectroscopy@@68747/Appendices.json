The technique involves bombarding the surface with high-energy electrons, which causes the ejection of core-level electrons from the atoms in the sample. The resulting core-hole is then filled by an electron from a higher energy level, and the energy released in this transition is transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom. This ejected electron is known as an Auger electron, and its kinetic energy is characteristic of the parent atom.\n\nFor a specific Auger process in a copper atom, a core-hole is created in the $L_3$ shell. An electron from the $M_2$ shell fills this hole, and the energy is transferred to an electron in the $M_4$ shell, which is then ejected.

This practice [@problem_id:2469900] guides you through the derivation of the fundamental equation used to determine the thickness of a thin film by modeling this signal attenuation.", "problem": "A semi-infinite substrate is analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). An Auger transition in the substrate produces electrons of a single kinetic energy, detected at a fixed take-off angle $\\theta$ with respect to the surface normal. Prior to any surface modification, the measured peak intensity of this substrate Auger line is $I_{0}$. After depositing a laterally uniform, fully covering overlayer of thickness $t$, the measured peak intensity of the same substrate Auger line is $I$.\n\nAssume the following physically standard conditions:\n- The substrate is semi-infinite and laterally uniform, and the overlayer is laterally uniform with constant thickness $t$.\n- Only electrons that traverse a given path in a solid without suffering inelastic scattering contribute to the peak intensity at the fixed kinetic energy; this survival probability is described by the Beer–Lambert law, $\\exp(-s/\\lambda)$, where $s$ is the path length in the medium and $\\lambda$ is the inelastic mean free path in that medium at the Auger electron’s kinetic energy.\n- The overlayer does not generate electrons at the substrate’s Auger energy, so the detected peak is entirely due to electrons originating in the substrate.\n- The inelastic attenuation length in the overlayer for electrons at the substrate Auger energy is $\\lambda$ (take this as the effective attenuation length in the overlayer), and the detector’s angular acceptance is narrow enough that a single take-off angle $\\theta$ characterizes the path geometry.\n- Any attenuation within the substrate itself is unchanged by the presence of the overlayer, so that the ratio of measured intensities isolates the attenuation due to passage through the overlayer.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and the Beer–Lambert law, derive an explicit closed-form expression for the overlayer thickness $t$ in terms of $I_{0}$, $I$, $\\lambda$, and $\\theta$. Express your final answer as a single symbolic expression for $t$ in terms of these quantities. Do not include units in your final boxed expression.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions. I will therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the attenuation of electrons passing through a solid is the Beer–Lambert law. The probability that an electron travels a distance $s$ through a material without an inelastic collision is given by $\\exp(-s/\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the inelastic mean free path (or more accurately for this context, the attenuation length) of the electron in the medium.\n\nThe intensity of the Auger signal, $I$, is proportional to the number of electrons detected per unit time that have originated from the substrate and have not undergone inelastic scattering.\n\nIn the first case, without an overlayer, the measured intensity is $I_0$. This intensity is the result of all Auger electrons generated within the substrate that successfully escape to the surface and are collected by the detector. The problem states that attenuation within the substrate is a constant factor that will be eliminated by considering the ratio of intensities. Thus, we can write $I_0 = C$, where $C$ is a constant incorporating the generation rate, detector efficiency, and attenuation effects within the substrate itself.\n\nIn the second case, a uniform overlayer of thickness $t$ is deposited on the substrate. For an Auger electron originating from the substrate to reach the detector, it must first traverse the overlayer. The path length, $s$, of the electron through this overlayer depends on the overlayer thickness, $t$, and the take-off angle, $\\theta$, which is defined with respect to the surface normal.\n\nFrom simple trigonometry, the relationship between the thickness $t$ (adjacent side of a right triangle), the path length $s$ (hypotenuse), and the angle $\\theta$ is given by:\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{t}{s} $$\nFrom this, we can express the path length $s$ as:\n$$ s = \\frac{t}{\\cos(\\theta)} $$\nNote that $\\theta$ must be in the range $[0, \\pi/2)$, as $\\theta = \\pi/2$ would correspond to an infinite path length for any non-zero thickness.\n\nThe fraction of electrons that traverse this path length $s$ through the overlayer without being inelastically scattered is the attenuation factor, $A$. According to the Beer–Lambert law, this factor is:\n$$ A = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $s$, we find the attenuation due to the overlayer:\n$$ A = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that the overlayer does not generate electrons at the substrate's Auger energy and that the ratio of intensities isolates the attenuation due to the overlayer. Therefore, the new intensity, $I$, is the original intensity, $I_0$, multiplied by this attenuation factor $A$.\n$$ I = I_0 A = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)}\\right) $$\nOur objective is to derive an expression for the thickness $t$. To do so, we must rearrange the equation. First, we form the ratio of the intensities:\n$$ \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)}\\right) $$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = \\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)}\\right)\\right] $$\nThe natural logarithm and the exponential function are inverses, so:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)} $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we can rewrite the equation to remove the negative sign, which is a more conventional form:\n$$ -\\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right) = \\frac{t}{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)} $$\nFinally, we isolate $t$ by multiplying both sides by $\\lambda \\cos(\\theta)$:\n$$ t = \\lambda \\cos(\\theta) \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right) $$\nThis is the explicit closed-form expression for the overlayer thickness $t$ in terms of the given quantities $I_0$, $I$, $\\lambda$, and $\\theta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda \\cos(\\theta) \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{0}}{I}\\right)}$$", "id": "2469900"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most common application of quantitative AES is determining the elemental composition of a material's surface, such as an alloy.
