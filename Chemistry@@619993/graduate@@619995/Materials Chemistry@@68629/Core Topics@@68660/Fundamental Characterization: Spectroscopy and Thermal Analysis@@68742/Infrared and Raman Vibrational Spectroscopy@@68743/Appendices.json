No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the vibrational modes of a planar trigonal molecule, $\\text{BF}_3$, which belongs to the $D_{3h}$ point group. The objective is to determine the number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies. This analysis will be conducted using the principles of group theory.\n\nFirst, we must determine the characters of the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, which describes the transformation properties of the $3N$ Cartesian displacement vectors of the $N=4$ atoms in the molecule. The character for a given symmetry operation, $\\chi(R)$, is calculated as the product of the number of atoms that remain unshifted by the operation, $U(R)$, and the character of the transformation of the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate system at each unshifted atom.\n\nLet us compute the characters for each class of operation in the $D_{3h}$ group. The total number of atoms is $N=4$ ($1$ B, $3$ F). The total degrees of freedom are $3N=12$.\n\n1.  **Identity, $E$**: All $4$ atoms are unshifted, so $U(E) = 4$. The identity operation leaves $(x, y, z)$ unchanged, represented by a $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix with a trace of $3$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(E) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\n2.  **Principal axis rotation, $C_3$**: Rotation by $120^\\circ$ about the $z$-axis. Only the central Boron atom is unshifted, so $U(C_3) = 1$. The transformation matrix for rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the $z$-axis has a trace of $1 + 2\\cos\\theta$. For $C_3$, $\\theta = 120^\\circ$, so the trace is $1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 1 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Perpendicular $C_2$ rotation, $C_2'$**: Rotation by $180^\\circ$ about an axis passing through the Boron atom and one Fluorine atom. $U(C_2') = 2$. The trace of a $180^\\circ$ rotation is $1 + 2\\cos(180^\\circ) = 1 - 2 = -1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_2') = 2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Horizontal reflection, $\\sigma_h$**: Reflection through the molecular ($xy$) plane. All $4$ atoms lie in this plane and are unshifted, so $U(\\sigma_h) = 4$. Reflection through the $xy$-plane transforms $(x, y, z)$ to $(x, y, -z)$, for which the transformation matrix has a trace of $1 + 1 - 1 = 1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_h) = 4 \\times 1 = 4$.\n\n5.  **Improper rotation, $S_3$**: A $C_3$ rotation followed by a $\\sigma_h$ reflection. Only the central Boron atom is unshifted, so $U(S_3) = 1$. The trace for an $S_n$ operation is $-1 + 2\\cos(2\\pi/n)$. For $S_3$, this is $-1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = -1 - 1 = -2$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(S_3) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Vertical reflection, $\\sigma_v$**: Reflection through a plane containing the principal axis and a B-F bond. This plane contains the Boron atom and one Fluorine atom, so $U(\\sigma_v) = 2$. Such a reflection transforms $(x, y, z)$ to $(x, -y, z)$ (if the plane is $xz$), with a trace of $1 - 1 + 1 = 1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ are therefore:\nClass: $E, 2C_3, 3C_2', \\sigma_h, 2S_3, 3\\sigma_v$\n$\\chi_{3N}$: $12, 0, -2, 4, -2, 2$\n\nNext, we decompose $\\Gamma_{3N}$ into its irreducible representations ($\\Gamma_i$) using the reduction formula:\n$$a_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{3N}(R)$$\nwhere $h=12$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the size of class $R$, and $\\chi_i(R)$ are the characters from the provided table.\n\n$a(A_1') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 - 6 + 4 - 4 + 6] = 1$\n$a(A_2') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot -1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 + 6 + 4 - 4 - 6] = 1$\n$a(E') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 2) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 0) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 2) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 0)] = \\frac{1}{12}[24 + 8 + 4] = 3$\n$a(A_1'') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot -1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot -1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 - 6 - 4 + 4 - 6] = 0$\n$a(A_2'') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot -1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 + 6 - 4 + 4 + 6] = 2$\n$a(E'') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 2) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 0) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot -2) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 0)] = \\frac{1}{12}[24 - 8 - 4] = 1$\n\nThus, the total representation is $\\Gamma_{3N} = A_1' + A_2' + 3E' + 2A_2'' + E''$. The total dimensionality is $1+1+3(2)+2(1)+1(2) = 12$, which matches $3N$.\n\nThe $3N$ degrees of freedom include overall translation and rotation of the molecule. We must subtract the representations for these motions to find the vibrational representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$.\nThe translational modes transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. From the problem statement, $(x,y)$ transform as $E'$ and $z$ transforms as $A_2''$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} = E' + A_2''$.\nThe rotational modes for a non-linear molecule transform as rotations about the axes, $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$. For the $D_{3h}$ point group, $R_z$ transforms as $A_2'$ and the degenerate pair $(R_x, R_y)$ transforms as $E''$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} = A_2' + E''$.\n\nThe vibrational representation is $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{\\text trans} - \\Gamma_{\\text rot}$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = (A_1' + A_2' + 3E' + 2A_2'' + E'') - (E' + A_2'') - (A_2' + E'')$$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1' + (3-1)E' + (2-1)A_2'' = A_1' + 2E' + A_2'' $$\nThe number of vibrational modes is the sum of the dimensions of these irreducible representations: $1 + 2(2) + 1 = 6$, which correctly matches the formula $3N-6=3(4)-6=6$ for a non-linear molecule.\n\nA vibrational mode is infrared (IR)-active if its irreducible representation transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. The problem states that $x,y$ transform as $E'$ and $z$ transforms as $A_2''$.\nOur vibrational modes are $A_1'$, two distinct modes of symmetry $E'$, and one mode of symmetry $A_2''$.\n-   The $A_1'$ mode is IR-inactive.\n-   The $A_2''$ mode is IR-active.\n-   The two $E'$ modes are IR-active.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies. The decomposition $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1' + 2E' + A_2''$ indicates there are four fundamental vibrations in total. One of type $A_1'$, one of type $A_2''$, and two distinct vibrations both of type $E'$. These two $E'$ modes will in general have different frequencies.\nThe IR-active vibrations are:\n- One non-degenerate mode of symmetry $A_2''$. This corresponds to one fundamental frequency.\n- Two doubly-degenerate modes of symmetry $E'$. Each of these corresponds to a distinct fundamental frequency.\nThe parenthetical \"(count each degenerate irreducible representation once)\" is interpreted to mean that a single degenerate mode, such as an $E'$ mode, accounts for one frequency, not a number of frequencies equal to its dimension. This is standard. Since our analysis yields two distinct modes of $E'$ symmetry, there are two distinct frequencies associated with this symmetry type.\nIn total, there is one frequency from the $A_2''$ mode and two frequencies from the two $E'$ modes.\nThe total number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies is therefore $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor completeness, we identify the Raman-active modes. A mode is Raman-active if its symmetry is shared with a quadratic basis function. The problem provides $A_1'$ and $E'$ as Raman-active symmetries. The non-degenerate vibrational modes show exclusive activity: the $A_1'$ mode is Raman-active but IR-inactive, while the $A_2''$ mode is IR-active but Raman-inactive. This is a common feature in groups with a horizontal mirror plane. The degenerate $E'$ modes are active in both IR and Raman spectra.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "2493596"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just identifying active modes, we often need to understand the factors that determine a vibration's frequency.

Substituting $\\delta$ into the equation for $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\sqrt{\\delta^2 + 4W^2}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the interaction pushes the energy levels apart; the final separation $\\Delta E$ must be greater than or equal to the initial separation $|\\delta|$. We can now solve for the magnitude of the coupling, $|W|$:\n$$\n(\\Delta E)^2 = \\delta^2 + 4W^2\n$$\n$$\n4W^2 = (\\Delta E)^2 - \\delta^2\n$$\n$$\n|W| = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\Delta E)^2 - \\delta^2}\n$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values provided in the problem. The energies are given in units of wavenumbers ($\\text{cm}^{-1}$), so the resulting coupling constant will also be in these units.\nThe observed energies are $E_1 = 1612\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $E_2 = 1576\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The separation is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 1612\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} - 1576\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 36\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe unperturbed energies are $E_s^{(0)} = 1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $E_b^{(0)} = 1588\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Their separation is:\n$$\n\\delta = 1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} - 1588\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 12\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nWe can now calculate $|W|$:\n$$\n|W| = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(36)^2 - (12)^2}\n$$\n$$\n|W| = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1296 - 144} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1152}\n$$\nTo simplify the square root, we can factor $1152$: $1152 = 2 \\times 576 = 2 \\times 24^2$.\n$$\n|W| = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2 \\times 24^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24\\sqrt{2} = 12\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical value rounded to four significant figures.
