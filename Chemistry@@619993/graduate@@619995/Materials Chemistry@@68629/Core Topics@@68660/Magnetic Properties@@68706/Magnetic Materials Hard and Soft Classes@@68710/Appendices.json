This practice guides you through the derivation of the anisotropy field, $H_k$, which represents the theoretical field required to saturate a material along its hard axis. By working through this problem [@problem_id:2497675], you will connect the microscopic anisotropy constant $K$ to the macroscopic field $H_k$ and assess a material's practical potential as a hard magnet by comparing this intrinsic limit to its self-demagnetizing field.", "problem": "A single-domain uniaxial ferromagnet is described by an anisotropy energy density $E_{\\text{an}}(\\theta) = K \\sin^{2}\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ and the easy axis, and by a Zeeman energy density $E_{Z} = -\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}$, where $\\mu_{0}$ is the magnetic constant and $\\mathbf{H}$ is an externally applied magnetic field. Consider quasistatic coherent rotation with the external field applied along the hard axis (perpendicular to the easy axis).

The final numeric answer you report must be only the value of $H_{k}$ as requested above.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It presents a standard problem in micromagnetism based on the Stoner-Wohlfarth model for coherent magnetization rotation. All necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution. The subtle use of \"$M_s = 1.2$ T\" is immediately and correctly clarified as representing the saturation polarization $J_s = \\mu_0 M_s = 1.2$ T, which is a valid physical quantity. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe total magnetic energy density $E_{total}$ for a single-domain uniaxial ferromagnet is the sum of the anisotropy energy density $E_{\\text{an}}$ and the Zeeman energy density $E_{Z}$.\nThe anisotropy energy density is given as:\n$$E_{\\text{an}}(\\theta) = K \\sin^{2}\\theta$$\nwhere $K$ is the anisotropy constant and $\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetization vector $\\mathbf{M}$ and the easy axis.\n\nThe Zeeman energy density is given by:\n$$E_{Z} = -\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{M}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{H}$ is the external magnetic field and $\\mu_{0}$ is the magnetic constant. The magnitude of the magnetization is the saturation magnetization, $|\\mathbf{M}| = M_{s}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the external field $\\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the hard axis, which is perpendicular to the easy axis. We can establish a coordinate system where the easy axis is along the x-axis and the field $\\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the y-axis. The magnetization vector $\\mathbf{M}$ will, by symmetry, be confined to the xy-plane. If $\\theta$ is the angle that $\\mathbf{M}$ makes with the easy (x) axis, then the angle between $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta$.\n\nThe Zeeman energy density becomes:\n$$E_{Z} = -\\mu_{0} |\\mathbf{M}| |\\mathbf{H}| \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta\\right) = -\\mu_{0} M_{s} H \\sin\\theta$$\nwhere $H = |\\mathbf{H}|$.\n\nThe total energy density as a function of the magnetization angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$E(\\theta) = E_{\\text{an}}(\\theta) + E_{Z}(\\theta) = K \\sin^{2}\\theta - \\mu_{0} M_{s} H \\sin\\theta$$\nThe equilibrium orientations of the magnetization correspond to the minima of this energy function. To find these, we first find the stationary points by setting the first derivative of $E(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{dE}{d\\theta} = 2K \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta - \\mu_{0} M_{s} H \\cos\\theta = \\cos\\theta (2K \\sin\\theta - \\mu_{0} M_{s} H) = 0$$\nThis equation yields two sets of possible stationary points:\n$1.$ $\\cos\\theta = 0$, which means $\\theta = \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$2.$ $2K \\sin\\theta - \\mu_{0} M_{s} H = 0$, which implies $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0} M_{s} H}{2K}$.\n\nTo determine if these stationary points are minima (stable equilibrium) or maxima (unstable equilibrium), we must examine the sign of the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K(\\cos^{2}\\theta - \\sin^{2}\\theta) + \\mu_{0} M_{s} H \\sin\\theta$$\nA point is a minimum if $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} > 0$ and a maximum if $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}}  0$.\n\nThe anisotropy field $H_{k}$ is defined as the field required to remove the energy barrier that maintains bistability. At zero field ($H=0$), there are two minima at $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$ (the easy axis directions), separated by energy barriers (maxima) at $\\theta=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. As $H$ increases, the minimum originally near $\\theta=0$ shifts, while the energy barrier at $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ lowers. The anisotropy field $H_{k}$ is the critical field at which the minimum and the adjacent maximum merge into a single inflection point, thus eliminating the barrier and the bistability. This occurs when both $\\frac{dE}{d\\theta} = 0$ and $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 0$ are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nFrom the second stationary condition, we have $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0} M_{s} H}{2K}$. Let's substitute this into the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K(1 - 2\\sin^{2}\\theta) + \\mu_{0} M_{s} H \\sin\\theta = 2K\\left(1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} M_{s} H}{2K}\\right)^{2}\\right) + \\mu_{0} M_{s} H \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} M_{s} H}{2K}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K - \\frac{(\\mu_{0} M_{s} H)^{2}}{K} + \\frac{(\\mu_{0} M_{s} H)^{2}}{2K} = 2K - \\frac{(\\mu_{0} M_{s} H)^{2}}{2K}$$\nSetting the second derivative to zero to find the critical field $H_{k}$:\n$$2K - \\frac{(\\mu_{0} M_{s} H_{k})^{2}}{2K} = 0 \\implies (\\mu_{0} M_{s} H_{k})^{2} = 4K^{2}$$\nTaking the positive root for the field magnitude, we get $\\mu_{0} M_{s} H_{k} = 2K$.\nSolving for the anisotropy field $H_{k}$ gives the expression in terms of $K$ and $M_{s}$:\n$$H_{k} = \\frac{2K}{\\mu_{0} M_{s}}$$\nThe problem provides the saturation polarization $J_{s} \\equiv \\mu_{0} M_{s}$. Substituting this definition, we obtain the expression for $H_{k}$ in terms of $K$ and $J_{s}$:\n$$H_{k} = \\frac{2K}{J_{s}}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value. We are given $K = 4 \\times 10^{5}$ J/m$^{3}$ and $J_{s} = 1.2$ T. The units are consistent: $\\frac{\\text{J/m}^3}{\\text{T}} = \\frac{\\text{N/m}^2}{\\text{N/(A}\\cdot\\text{m)}} = \\text{A/m}$.\n$$H_{k} = \\frac{2 \\times (4 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ J/m}^{3})}{1.2 \\text{ T}} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{5}}{1.2} \\text{ A/m} = \\frac{20}{3} \\times 10^{5} \\text{ A/m} \\approx 6.666... \\times 10^{5} \\text{ A/m}$$\nThe question asks for the result in kiloampere per meter (kA/m), rounded to three significant figures:\n$$H_{k} \\approx 667 \\text{ kA/m}$$\n\nFinally, we discuss whether the material is magnetically hard. A hard magnetic material is one that resists demagnetization and can serve as a permanent magnet. This property is quantified by a high coercivity, for which $H_{k}$ is an intrinsic upper bound. A magnet must be able to resist its own demagnetizing field, $H_{d}$, which arises from surface magnetic charges. This field is estimated as $H_{d} \\approx N M_{s}$, where $N$ is the geometry-dependent demagnetizing factor, $N \\in [\\frac{1}{3}, 1]$.\nTo compare $H_{k}$ with $H_{d}$, we first calculate $M_{s}$:\n$$M_{s} = \\frac{J_{s}}{\\mu_{0}} = \\frac{1.2 \\text{ T}}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ T}\\cdot\\text{m/A}} \\approx 9.549 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ A/m}$$\nThe range for the demagnetizing field is therefore:\n$$H_{d} \\approx N M_{s} \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{3} (9.549 \\times 10^{5}), 1 \\cdot (9.549 \\times 10^{5})\\right] \\text{ A/m}$$\n$$H_{d} \\in [3.18 \\times 10^{5}, 9.55 \\times 10^{5}] \\text{ A/m} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad H_{d} \\in [318, 955] \\text{ kA/m}$$\nOur calculated anisotropy field is $H_{k} \\approx 667$ kA/m. Comparing this value to the range of $H_{d}$, we see that $H_{k}$ is greater than $H_{d}$ for objects with small demagnetizing factors (e.g., spheres, where $N=\\frac{1}{3}$, or long needles) but can be smaller than $H_{d}$ for objects with large $N$ (e.g., a thin plate magnetized normal to its surface, where $N \\to 1$).\nHowever, a value of $H_k$ in the several hundreds of kA/m is characteristic of magnetically hard materials. Soft magnetic materials have coercivities orders of magnitude smaller. The condition for a stable permanent magnet is that its coercivity $H_c$ (which is bounded by $H_k$) must be larger than the demagnetizing field $H_d$ for its given shape. Since $H_{k}$ surmounts $H_{d}$ for a significant range of practical shapes ($N  H_{k}/M_{s} \\approx (667)/(955) \\approx 0.7$), the material is robust against self-demagnetization in many configurations. Therefore, based on the large magnitude of its anisotropy field, the material is properly classified as magnetically hard.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{667}$$", "id": "2497675"}, {"introduction": "While intrinsic properties like the anisotropy field define a material's potential, the ultimate measure of a permanent magnet's utility is its ability to project a magnetic field into a space—its energy product.

It represents a standard problem in the field of micromagnetism concerning the stability of magnetic domain structures. All necessary physical quantities and assumptions are provided for a formal derivation. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe central principle for this problem is the competition between two primary energy contributions in a magnetic particle: the magnetostatic self-energy, which favors flux closure through domain formation, and the domain-wall energy, which represents the cost of creating interfaces between domains. The critical radius, $R_{c}$, is the size at which the energy of a uniformly magnetized single-domain state becomes equal to the energy of a simple two-domain state. Beyond this radius, the two-domain configuration is energetically favorable.\n\nFirst, we formulate the energy of the single-domain state, $E_{SD}$. For a uniformly magnetized particle, this energy is dominated by the magnetostatic or demagnetizing energy, $E_{demag}$. The expression for this energy is given by:\n$$E_{demag} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{0} N_{d} M_{s}^{2} V$$\nwhere $\\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space, $N_{d}$ is the demagnetizing factor, $M_{s}$ is the saturation magnetization, and $V$ is the volume of the particle. For a sphere, the demagnetizing factor is $N_{d} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and the volume is $V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^{3}$.

In this configuration, a domain wall divides the sphere into two hemispheres with antiparallel magnetization. This structure drastically reduces the external magnetic field and thus the magnetostatic energy. As a first-order approximation, we assume the magnetostatic energy of the two-domain state is negligible compared to that of the single-domain state. The total energy is therefore dominated by the energy required to create the domain wall, $E_{wall}$.\n$$E_{TD} \\approx E_{wall} = \\gamma_{wall} S_{wall}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{wall}$ is the domain-wall energy per unit area and $S_{wall}$ is the area of the wall. The problem specifies a single planar wall through the center of the sphere, which has the area of a great circle, $S_{wall} = \\pi R^{2}$.\n\nTo determine $\\gamma_{wall}$, we must consider the nature of the material. For a $180^{\\circ}$ Bloch wall, the standard expression for the energy density derived from a one-dimensional variational model is:\n$$\\gamma_{wall} = 4\\sqrt{A K_{eff}}$$\nwhere $A$ is the exchange stiffness constant and $K_{eff}$ is the effective magnetic anisotropy energy density. The problem states that for a very soft ferromagnet, the effective anisotropy is governed by the magnetostatic (shape) energy. Within the Bloch wall, the magnetic moments must rotate out of the easy plane of magnetization. For a domain wall modeled as an infinite thin sheet, the easy plane is the plane of the wall itself. The energy cost to orient magnetization perpendicular to this plane is the magnetostatic penalty. The corresponding anisotropy energy density is:\n$$K_{eff} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{0} M_{s}^{2}$$\nThis arises from the demagnetizing field within the wall, where the demagnetizing factor for a direction normal to an infinite plane is $1$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $K_{eff}$ into the formula for $\\gamma_{wall}$:\n$$\\gamma_{wall} = 4\\sqrt{A \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{0} M_{s}^{2}\\right)} = 4 M_{s} \\sqrt{\\frac{A \\mu_{0}}{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} M_{s} \\sqrt{A \\mu_{0}}$$\nThe total energy of the domain wall is then:\n$$E_{wall} = \\gamma_{wall} S_{wall} = \\left(2\\sqrt{2} M_{s} \\sqrt{A \\mu_{0}}\\right) \\left(\\pi R^{2}\\right) = 2\\pi\\sqrt{2} M_{s} \\sqrt{A \\mu_{0}} R^{2}$$\n\nThe critical radius $R_{c}$ is found by equating the energies of the two states, $E_{SD}(R_{c}) = E_{TD}(R_{c})$:\n$$\\frac{2}{9} \\pi \\mu_{0} M_{s}^{2} R_{c}^{3} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{2} M_{s} \\sqrt{A \\mu_{0}} R_{c}^{2}$$\nTo solve for $R_{c}$, we cancel common terms (assuming $R_{c} \\neq 0$, $M_{s} \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{9} \\mu_{0} M_{s} R_{c} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{A \\mu_{0}}$$\nIsolating $R_{c}$ gives the symbolic expression:\n$$R_{c} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{A \\mu_{0}}}{\\mu_{0} M_{s}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2A}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}} M_{s}}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the provided numerical values to estimate $R_{c}$:\n$A = 1.3 \\times 10^{-11} \\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-1}}$\n$M_{s} = 1.6 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{A\\,m^{-1}}$\n$\\mu_{0} = 4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{H\\,m^{-1}}$\n\n$$R_{c} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2(1.3 \\times 10^{-11})}}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7}} (1.6 \\times 10^{6})}$$\n$$R_{c} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2.6 \\times 10^{-11}}}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi \\times 10^{-7}} (1.6 \\times 10^{6})} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$R_{c} \\approx \\frac{9 \\times (5.0990 \\times 10^{-6})}{(1.1209 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.6 \\times 10^{6})} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$R_{c} \\approx \\frac{4.5891 \\times 10^{-5}}{1793.45} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$R_{c} \\approx 2.5588 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nConverting this result to nanometers gives $R_{c} \\approx 25.588 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. Rounding to $3$ significant figures as instructed, we obtain the final numerical estimate.\n$$R_{c} \\approx 25.6 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{25.6}\n$$", "id": "2497702"}]}
