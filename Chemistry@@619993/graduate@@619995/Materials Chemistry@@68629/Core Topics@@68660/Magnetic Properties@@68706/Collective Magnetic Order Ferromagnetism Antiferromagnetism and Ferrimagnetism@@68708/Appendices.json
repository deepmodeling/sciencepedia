In real materials, especially at higher concentrations or lower temperatures, exchange interactions between neighboring magnetic moments become significant. The Curie-Weiss law accounts for these interactions in a mean-field approximation.\nPhysical conditions for replacement: The Curie-Weiss law, $\\chi_m = C_m/(T-\\theta)$, must replace the Curie law when inter-spin exchange interactions are no longer negligible compared to the thermal energy, $k_B T$, which acts to randomize spin orientations. The Weiss temperature, $\\theta$, is a measure of the strength and nature of these interactions. A positive $\\theta$ indicates ferromagnetic interactions (favoring parallel alignment), while a negative $\\theta$ indicates antiferromagnetic interactions (favoring antiparallel alignment).\nPhysically motivated criterion: The Curie law is the high-temperature limit of the Curie-Weiss law. For $T \\gg |\\theta|$, one can expand the Curie-Weiss expression:\n$$\n\\chi_m = \\frac{C_m}{T(1-\\theta/T)} \\approx \\frac{C_m}{T} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\theta}{T} + \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 + \\dots \\right)\n$$\nThe first term is the Curie law. The deviation from the Curie law is governed by the magnitude of the ratio $|\\theta|/T$. This ratio compares the energy scale of the magnetic interactions ($k_B\\theta$) to the thermal energy ($k_B T$). The replacement of the Curie law with the Curie-Weiss law becomes necessary when this ratio is no longer negligible. A common, practical criterion is when the deviation from ideal behavior becomes experimentally significant, for example, when $|\\theta|/T$ exceeds a threshold such as $0.01$ or $0.05$. Therefore, the criterion for needing the Curie-Weiss law is that the temperature $T$ is not sufficiently large compared to the magnitude of the Weiss temperature $|\\theta|$, i.e., the condition $T \\gg |\\theta|$ is no longer met.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.85 \\times 10^{-7}} $$", "id": "2473844"}, {"introduction": "The transition from simple paramagnetism to collective order is driven by exchange interactions, but how do spins separated by non-magnetic atoms communicate?

In the specified limit where the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U_d$ and the charge-transfer energy $\\Delta$ are large compared to the metal-oxygen hopping integral $t$, we primarily consider two mechanisms derived from second-order perturbation theory.\n\n1.  **Kinetic Exchange (Antiferromagnetic, AFM)**: This mechanism provides a significant contribution to $J$ when two half-filled metal $d$ orbitals can hybridize with the *same* intervening ligand $p$ orbital. A virtual hop of an electron from $\\mathrm{M}_1$ to $\\mathrm{M}_2$ via the oxygen is possible. The intermediate state would have two electrons on $\\mathrm{M}_2$. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, these two electrons must have opposite spins.

This stabilizes the antiferromagnetic alignment, yielding a negative contribution to the exchange constant, $J_{\\text{AFM}} \\approx -2t_{12}^2/U_d  0$, where $t_{12}$ is the effective hopping between the two metal sites.\n\n2.  **Potential Exchange (Ferromagnetic, FM)**: This mechanism becomes relevant when kinetic exchange is suppressed by symmetry, for example, when the relevant metal $d$ orbitals couple to *orthogonal* ligand $p$ orbitals. In this scenario, virtual charge transfer can occur from two orthogonal oxygen $p$ orbitals to the two metal sites. Hund's rule on the oxygen atom ($J_H^p>0$) favors parallel alignment of the electron spins within the oxygen $p$ shell. This preference is transferred to the metal ions, stabilizing a ferromagnetic alignment. This results in a positive contribution to the exchange constant, with a magnitude typically of the order $J_{\\text{FM}} \\propto t^4 J_H^p / \\Delta^4$ or a similar form, but always resulting in $J > 0$ when $J_H^p > 0$.\n\nWith these principles, we analyze the four scenarios.\n\n*   **Case 1: Two high-spin $d^5$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$) at $180^\\circ$**: The $d^5$ configuration means all $d$ orbitals ($t_{2g}$ and $e_g$) are half-filled. At a $180^\\circ$ angle, there are efficient pathways for kinetic exchange. The half-filled $e_g$ orbitals on each metal couple to the same central oxygen $p_\\sigma$ orbital ($e_g\\text{–}p_\\sigma\\text{–}e_g$ path). The half-filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals couple to the same oxygen $p_\\pi$ orbitals ($t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ path). Both pathways connect half-filled orbitals and thus contribute strongly to AFM kinetic exchange. The total coupling is therefore strongly antiferromagnetic, $J  0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two high-spin $d^5$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$) at $90^\\circ$**: All $d$ orbitals are again half-filled. However, at a $90^\\circ$ angle, the problem states that the dominant hybridization pathways from each metal cation are to mutually orthogonal oxygen $p$ orbitals. This \"accidental orthogonality\" ensures that any pathway of the form $d(\\mathrm{M}_1)\\text{–}p(\\mathrm{O})\\text{–}d(\\mathrm{M}_2)$ involving a *single* p-orbital has zero or near-zero overlap. Consequently, AFM kinetic exchange is suppressed. The dominant mechanism becomes the potential exchange, mediated by Hund's coupling on the oxygen ($J_H^p$), which favors parallel spin alignment. The coupling is therefore ferromagnetic, $J  0$.\n\n*   **Case 3: Two $d^3$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^0$) at $180^\\circ$**: The $t_{2g}$ orbitals are half-filled, while the $e_g$ orbitals are empty. For the $180^\\circ$ geometry, the $e_g\\text{–}p_\\sigma\\text{–}e_g$ pathway involves empty orbitals and cannot mediate kinetic exchange. However, the $t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ pathway connects half-filled orbitals via common $p_\\pi$ orbitals. This gives rise to a strong AFM kinetic exchange contribution. Therefore, the overall interaction is predominantly antiferromagnetic, $J  0$.\n\n*   **Case 4: Two $d^3$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^0$) at $90^\\circ$**: The $t_{2g}$ orbitals are half-filled. As in Case 2, the $90^\\circ$ geometry suppresses the AFM kinetic exchange pathway due to orbital orthogonality. The dominant interaction is again the FM potential exchange, which requires only that the interacting metal orbitals be partially filled (in this case, half-filled) and that $J_H^p$ is finite. The interaction is thus ferromagnetic, $J  0$.\n\nNow, I shall evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For two high-spin $d^5$ ions linked at $180^\\circ$, the exchange is predominantly AFM ($J0$), with sizable contributions from both the $e_g\\text{–}p_\\sigma\\text{–}e_g$ and $t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ channels between half-filled orbitals.**\nThis statement is a precise description of the GKA rules applied to the $d^5\\text{–}d^5$ linear bridge. As derived in Case 1, both the $\\sigma$-pathway involving $e_g$ orbitals and the $\\pi$-pathway involving $t_{2g}$ orbitals are active and connect half-filled orbitals, leading to strong AFM coupling ($J0$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For two high-spin $d^5$ ions linked at $90^\\circ$, the leading superexchange is FM ($J0$) because the AFM kinetic exchange between half-filled orbitals is symmetry-suppressed by orthogonality of the oxygen $p$ orbitals that each metal sees; a residual FM contribution arises via Hund’s coupling on oxygen $J_H^p$.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the analysis of Case 2. The $90^\\circ$ geometry leads to orthogonality of the main hopping paths, which quenches the strong AFM kinetic exchange. The next-order effect, potential exchange, is FM ($J0$) and is dependent on the Hund's coupling on oxygen, $J_H^p$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For two $d^3$ ions linked at $180^\\circ$, the exchange is predominantly FM ($J0$) because the empty $e_g$ shell shifts the dominant pathway to $\\sigma$-type hopping that favors parallel alignment.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As analyzed in Case 3, the presence of half-filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals provides a strong $t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ pathway for AFM kinetic exchange at $180^\\circ$. This AFM interaction is typically dominant. The claim that the interaction is FM is false. While certain mechanisms involving empty orbitals can be ferromagnetic, they do not supersede the strong kinetic exchange path that is available here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For two $d^3$ ions linked at $90^\\circ$, the exchange can be FM ($J0$) even though the occupied orbitals are $t_{2g}$, because the two metals couple to orthogonal oxygen $p$ orbitals, suppressing AFM kinetic exchange and leaving a FM contribution from $J_H^p$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the analysis of Case 4. The $90^\\circ$ bridge geometry suppresses the kinetic exchange between the half-filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals. This leaves the FM potential exchange, mediated by $J_H^p$, as the dominant term, resulting in $J0$. The reasoning provided is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The sign of $J$ in these superexchange-coupled dimers is determined solely by the $\\mathrm{M}\\text{–}\\mathrm{O}\\text{–}\\mathrm{M}$ angle and is insensitive to whether the cations are high-spin $d^5$ or $d^3$ under the stated limits.**\nThis statement is a fallacious overgeneralization. The electronic configuration is a primary determinant of the exchange interaction, as it dictates which orbitals are occupied and thus which exchange pathways are active. While for the specific pair of configurations $d^3$ and high-spin $d^5$, the sign of $J$ happens to correlate with the angle ($180^\\circ \\rightarrow \\text{AFM}$, $90^\\circ \\rightarrow \\text{FM}$), this is a consequence of both configurations possessing half-filled orbitals that enable these mechanisms. To demonstrate that configuration is critical, consider a hypothetical $d^8(t_{2g}^6 e_g^2)\\text{–}\\mathrm{O}\\text{–}d^3(t_{2g}^3 e_g^0)$ linkage at $180^\\circ$. The interaction between the half-filled $e_g$ orbital on the $d^8$ ion and the empty $e_g$ orbital on the $d^3$ ion through the $p_\\sigma$ orbital would lead to a strong ferromagnetic coupling. This contradicts the AFM coupling found for $d^3\\text{–}d^3$ or $d^5\\text{–}d^5$ at the same angle. Thus, the electronic configuration is not an insensitive detail.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. In the idealized $90^\\circ$ geometry with perfect orthogonality of the relevant oxygen $p$ orbitals and if $J_H^p$ were artificially set to zero, the leading superexchange between half-filled orbitals vanishes by symmetry, so that the net $J$ from the oxygen-mediated superexchange path is strictly zero in this limit.**\nThis statement describes a logical consequence of the model's idealizations. The leading AFM kinetic exchange term is suppressed (\"vanishes by symmetry\") in the idealized $90^\\circ$ geometry due to the orthogonality condition. The leading FM potential exchange mechanism is proportional to $J_H^p$. Therefore, if $J_H^p$ were set to zero, this FM contribution would also vanish.
