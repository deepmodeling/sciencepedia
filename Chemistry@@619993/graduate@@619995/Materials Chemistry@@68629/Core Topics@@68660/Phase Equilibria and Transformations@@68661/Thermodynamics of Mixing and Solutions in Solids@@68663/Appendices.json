A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with the statistical interpretation of entropy. For a system of $N_A$ particles of component $A$ and $N_B$ particles of component $B$ arranged randomly on $N_{sites} = N_A + N_B$ equivalent lattice sites, the number of distinct microstates, or configurations, $W$, is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nW = \\frac{(N_A + N_B)!}{N_A!

The mole fractions $x_A = n_A/(n_A+n_B)$ and $x_B = n_B/(n_A+n_B)$ are identical to the particle fractions.

When the molar Gibbs free energy function $G(x)$ has a double-well shape (containing a region of downward concavity, i.e., $\\frac{d^2G}{dx^2}  0$), a homogeneous mixture is no longer the state of lowest free energy for all compositions.

The sign of $\\Phi$ is directly related to the thermodynamic stability of the solution, which is determined by the curvature of the Gibbs energy of mixing, $\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2}$. Let us derive this relationship. We take the second derivative of $G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left( RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) \\;+\\; \\Omega\\,(1-2x) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2} \\;=\\; RT\\left(\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{-1}{1-x}\\right) - 2\\Omega \\;=\\; RT\\left(\\frac{1-x+x}{x(1-x)}\\right) - 2\\Omega\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)} - 2\\Omega\n$$\nComparing this with our expression for $\\Phi$:\n$$\n\\Phi \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{2\\Omega x(1-x)}{RT} \\;=\\; \\frac{RT - 2\\Omega x(1-x)}{RT}\n$$\nMultiplying $\\Phi$ by the positive definite factor $\\frac{RT}{x(1-x)}$ for $x \\in (0,1)$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{RT}{x(1-x)}\\Phi \\;=\\; \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)}\\left(\\frac{RT - 2\\Omega x(1-x)}{RT}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{RT - 2\\Omega x(1-x)}{x(1-x)} \\;=\\; \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)} - 2\\Omega\n$$\nThus, we have the direct relation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{RT}{x(1-x)}\\Phi\n$$\nSince $\\frac{RT}{x(1-x)}$ is always positive, the sign of $\\Phi$ is identical to the sign of the curvature of $G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$. A negative value, $\\Phi  0$, corresponds to $\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2}  0$. This condition of negative curvature (concave downward Gibbs energy curve) defines a region of thermodynamic instability, known as the spinodal region.\n\nThe connection to uphill diffusion arises from the principles of irreversible thermodynamics. The diffusive flux of component $A$, $J_A$, is driven by the gradient of its chemical potential:\n$$\nJ_A \\;=\\; -M_A \\nabla \\mu_A\n$$\nwhere $M_A$ is the atomic mobility, an intrinsically positive coefficient. The chemical potential gradient can be expressed in terms of the composition gradient $\\nabla x$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mu_A \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial \\mu_A}{\\partial x} \\nabla x\n$$\nWe know that $\\mu_A - \\mu_A^0 = RT \\ln a_A$. Differentiating with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mu_A}{\\partial x} \\;=\\; RT \\frac{\\partial \\ln a_A}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFrom the definition of $\\Phi = x \\frac{\\partial \\ln a_A}{\\partial x}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial \\ln a_A}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\Phi}{x}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mu_A}{\\partial x} \\;=\\; \\frac{RT}{x}\\Phi\n$$\nThe flux equation becomes:\n$$\nJ_A \\;=\\; -M_A \\left(\\frac{RT\\Phi}{x}\\right) \\nabla x\n$$\nThis expression is a generalized form of Fick's first law, $J_A = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\nabla x$, where the effective interdiffusion coefficient $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is proportional to $M_A \\frac{RT\\Phi}{x}$. Since $M_A$, $R$, $T$, and $x$ are all positive, the sign of $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is determined by the sign of $\\Phi$.\nIf $\\Phi  0$, then $D_{\\text{eff}}  0$. The flux is directed opposite to the concentration gradient, leading to homogenization (downhill diffusion).\nIf $\\Phi  0$, then $D_{\\text{eff}}  0$. The flux is directed along the concentration gradient. This means atoms diffuse from regions of lower concentration to regions of higher concentration, amplifying any existing fluctuations. This phenomenon is called uphill diffusion. Therefore, the condition $\\Phi  0$ (and equivalently $\\frac{\\partial^2 G_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{\\partial x^2}  0$) provides the thermodynamic driving force for spinodal decomposition, a phase separation process that proceeds via uphill diffusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.7183}\n$$", "id": "2532066"}]}
