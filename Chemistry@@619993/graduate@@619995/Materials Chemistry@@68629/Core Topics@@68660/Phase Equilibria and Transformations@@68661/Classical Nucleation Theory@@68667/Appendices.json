The system thus gains a substantial amount of energy by replacing the \"unfavorable\" substrate-parent interface with the \"favorable\" substrate-nucleus interface.

The net rate of conversion of clusters of size $n$ to size $n+1$, which is the flux $J_n$, is given by the difference between the forward rate (growth) and the backward rate (dissolution):\n$$J_n = f_n^+ N_n - f_{n+1}^- N_{n+1}$$\nwhere $N_n$ is the non-equilibrium concentration of clusters of size $n$, $f_n^+$ is the attachment frequency of monomers to a cluster of size $n$, and $f_{n+1}^-$ is the detachment frequency from a cluster of size $n+1$.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the flux is constant for all sizes past a small initial size, i.e., $J_n = J$ for all relevant $n$. The principle of detailed balance, which holds at equilibrium, states that the forward and backward rates are equal, meaning the net flux is zero:\n$$f_n^+ N_n^{\\mathrm{eq}} = f_{n+1}^- N_{n+1}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\nHere, $N_n^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium concentration of clusters of size $n$, given by a Boltzmann distribution relative to the number of nucleation sites $N_0$:\n$$N_n^{\\mathrm{eq}} = N_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_n}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_n$ is the free energy of formation for a cluster of size $n$ and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe standard Becker-Döring treatment solves the system of rate equations under the steady-state approximation ($J_n = J$) and the boundary conditions that $N_n \\to N_n^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ as $n \\to 1$ and $N_n \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This leads to an expression for the nucleation rate $J$ as an inverse sum of \"resistances\":\n$$J = \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{f_n^+ N_n^{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\right)^{-1}$$\nBy approximating the sum with an integral and expanding the free energy $\\Delta G_n$ as a continuous function quadratically around the critical nucleus size $n^*$, where $\\Delta G_n$ is maximum ($\\Delta G_{n^*} = \\Delta G^*$), one obtains:\n$$\\Delta G_n \\approx \\Delta G^* + \\frac{1}{2}(n-n^*)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta G}{\\partial n^2}\\right)_{n=n^*}$$\nThe integral is then evaluated using a Gaussian approximation, yielding the well-known result for the total nucleation rate:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{total}} = N_0 Z f^+ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $f^+$ is the attachment frequency to the critical nucleus ($f^+ \\equiv f_{n^*}^+$) and $Z$ is the Zeldovich factor, which accounts for the probability that a critical nucleus will grow rather than shrink. It is defined as:\n$$Z = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2\\pi k_B T} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Delta G}{\\partial n^2}\\right)_{n=n^*}}$$\nThe problem asks for the site-normalized nucleation rate, which we denote simply as $J$. This is the total rate divided by the number of nucleation sites $N_0$:\n$$J = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{total}}}{N_0} = Z f^+ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for the first task.\n\nFor the second task, we compute the numerical values of $J$ at temperatures $T_1 = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_2 = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$. We are given the values: $Z = 0.080$, $f^+ = 5.00 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\Delta G^* = 6.20 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}$, and $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nAt $T_1 = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\nThe argument of the exponential is\n$$\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B T_1} = \\frac{6.20 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})(800\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 5.61360$$\nThe nucleation rate $J_1$ is:\n$$J_1 = (0.080)(5.00 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\exp(-5.61360) \\approx (4.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.003648) \\approx 1.459 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nAt $T_2 = 900\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\nThe argument of the exponential is\n$$\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B T_2} = \\frac{6.20 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})(900\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 4.98987$$\nThe nucleation rate $J_2$ is:\n$$J_2 = (0.080)(5.00 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\\exp(-4.98987) \\approx (4.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.006807) \\approx 2.723 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nWe will report these values to three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the inputs: $J_1 = 1.46 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $J_2 = 2.72 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFor the third task, we determine the apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ from an Arrhenius plot of $\\ln J$ versus $1/T$. The general form of an Arrhenius-type expression is $J = A \\exp(-E_{\\mathrm{app}}/(k_B T))$. Taking the natural logarithm gives:\n$$\\ln J = \\ln A - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{app}}}{k_B} \\frac{1}{T}$$\nThis is the equation of a line where the slope of $\\ln J$ versus $1/T$ is $-E_{\\mathrm{app}}/k_B$.\nFrom our derived expression for $J$, we take the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln J = \\ln(Z f^+) - \\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B T}$$\nThe problem states that $Z$ and $f^+$ are to be treated as temperature-independent. Therefore, the pre-exponential term $\\ln(Z f^+)$ is a constant. By direct comparison of the two equations for $\\ln J$, the apparent activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is simply equal to the nucleation barrier $\\Delta G^*$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\Delta G^* = 6.20 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThis conclusion is based on the specific assumptions made in the problem statement. To confirm, we can calculate the slope using the two computed points $(1/T_1, \\ln J_1)$ and $(1/T_2, \\ln J_2)$:\n$$ \\text{slope} = \\frac{\\ln J_2 - \\ln J_1}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} = \\frac{\\ln(J_2/J_1)}{(T_1 - T_2)/(T_1 T_2)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_1$ and $J_2$:\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{Z f^+ \\exp(-\\Delta G^*/(k_B T_2))}{Z f^+ \\exp(-\\Delta G^*/(k_B T_1))} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right)$$\nSo, $\\ln(J_2/J_1) = \\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B}\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}$.\nSubstituting this back into the slope equation:\n$$\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B}\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}}{\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^*}{k_B}$$\nSince the slope is also equal to $-E_{\\mathrm{app}}/k_B$, we confirm that $E_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\Delta G^*$.\n\nThe problem requires $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$ in units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. We must convert the energy per event to energy per mole using the Avogadro constant, $N_A = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app, molar}} = E_{\\mathrm{app}} \\times N_A = (6.20 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app, molar}} \\approx 37337.27\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 37.33727\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{app}} = 37.34\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThe final answers for tasks $2$ and $3$ are thus the computed values for $J_1$, $J_2$, and $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1.46 \\times 10^{6} & 2.72 \\times 10^{6} & 37.34\\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2472868"}]}
