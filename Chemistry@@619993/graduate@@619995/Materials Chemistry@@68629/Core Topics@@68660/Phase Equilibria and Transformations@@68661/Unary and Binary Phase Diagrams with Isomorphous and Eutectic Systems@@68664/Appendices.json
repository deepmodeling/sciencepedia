We are tasked with determining the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom, denoted by $F$, for a pure substance existing in two-phase equilibrium. This must be done without recourse to the Gibbs phase rule as a pre-supposed formula.\n\nThe fundamental condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between multiple phases of a pure substance is the equality of the chemical potential, $\\mu$, of the substance across all coexisting phases. The chemical potential of a pure substance in a single phase is a function of two independent intensive variables, which are typically taken to be temperature, $T$, and pressure, $P$. Thus, we can write the chemical potential as $\\mu(T, P)$.\n\nLet us consider two arbitrary phases, denoted by the superscripts $(\\alpha)$ and $(\\beta)$, in equilibrium. The system is unary, meaning it consists of a single component ($C = 1$). The number of phases in equilibrium is two ($P = 2$). The condition for thermodynamic equilibrium is therefore expressed by a single equation:\n$$\n\\mu^{(\\alpha)}(T, P) = \\mu^{(\\beta)}(T, P)\n$$\nThis equation establishes a mathematical constraint on the otherwise independent variables $T$ and $P$.\n\nThe number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom, $F$, is defined as the number of independent intensive variables required to specify the thermodynamic state of the system while maintaining the number of phases in equilibrium. In our system, we begin with two independent intensive variables, $T$ and $P$. However, for the two phases to coexist, these variables must satisfy the single constraint equation given above.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom is therefore the total number of independent variables minus the number of independent constraint equations.\n$$\nF = (\\text{Number of Variables}) - (\\text{Number of Constraints})\n$$\nIn this case, the number of variables is $2$ (namely $T$ and $P$) and the number of constraints is $1$ (the equality of chemical potentials).\nTherefore, the number of degrees of freedom is:\n$$\nF = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$\nThis result is general for any two-phase equilibrium in a unary system. We can apply this reasoning to each of the three specific coexistence boundaries mentioned:\n\n1.  **Fusion Boundary (Solid–Liquid Equilibrium):** The two phases are solid ($S$) and liquid ($L$). The equilibrium condition is $\\mu^{(S)}(T, P) = \\mu^{(L)}(T, P)$. This is one equation relating the two variables $T$ and $P$, so $F = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Vaporization Boundary (Liquid–Vapor Equilibrium):** The two phases are liquid ($L$) and vapor ($V$). The equilibrium condition is $\\mu^{(L)}(T, P) = \\mu^{(V)}(T, P)$. This is again one equation relating $T$ and $P$, which yields $F = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Sublimation Boundary (Solid–Vapor Equilibrium):** The two phases are solid ($S$) and vapor ($V$). The equilibrium condition is $\\mu^{(S)}(T, P) = \\mu^{(V)}(T, P)$. This single constraint on the two variables $T$ and $P$ results in $F = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nIn all three cases, the number of degrees of freedom is $1$. This is the common numerical value shared by all three boundaries.\n\nThe physical interpretation of $F=1$ is that only one intensive variable can be independently altered while maintaining the two-phase equilibrium. For instance, along the vaporization curve, if we choose to set the temperature of the system, the pressure at which liquid and vapor coexist (the vapor pressure) is automatically fixed by the equilibrium condition. We are not free to choose the pressure independently. Conversely, if we set the pressure, the temperature of coexistence (the boiling point) is determined. The state of the system is thus confined to a line on the pressure-temperature phase diagram. Any point on this line represents a valid equilibrium state, but it is not possible to move off the line without causing one of the phases to disappear. Therefore, the macroscopic variables that can be altered independently are either pressure or temperature, but not both simultaneously.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2534115"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of coexistence, we now explore the quantitative relationship between pressure and temperature along a phase boundary.

The derivation must proceed from first principles, namely mass conservation and the specified solidification conditions.\n\nFirst, we define the variables as mole fractions. Let $C_{0}$ be the initial, uniform composition of the liquid alloy. Let $f_{S}$ be the fraction of the system that is solid, and $f_{L}$ be the fraction that is liquid, such that $f_{S} + f_{L} = 1$. Let $C_{L}$ be the instantaneous composition of the liquid, and $C_{S}$ be the composition of the solid forming at the solid-liquid interface. The problem states that local equilibrium is maintained at the interface, which implies a constant partition coefficient $k$ relating the two compositions:\n$$k = \\frac{C_{S}}{C_{L}} \\quad \\text{(Interfacial Equilibrium)}$$\n\nThe derivation is based on a differential mass balance for the solute. Consider a total of $1$ mole of the alloy. At a given stage of solidification, the amount of solute in the remaining liquid phase is $C_{L} f_{L}$. Now, we consider an infinitesimal step in the solidification process where a differential mass of liquid, $df_{S}$, solidifies. Since $f_{S} + f_{L} = 1$, it follows that $df_{S} = -df_{L}$. The amount of solute removed from the liquid and incorporated into this new solid is $C_{S} df_{S}$. This removal of solute causes the composition of the remaining liquid to change by an amount $dC_{L}$.\n\nThe mass balance for the solute in the liquid phase can be stated as: the initial amount of solute equals the final amount of solute plus the amount that has solidified.\n$$(\\text{Solute in liquid at } f_{L}) = (\\text{Solute in liquid at } f_{L} + df_{L}) + (\\text{Solute in solid formed})$$\n$$C_{L} f_{L} = (C_{L} + dC_{L})(f_{L} + df_{L}) + C_{S} (-df_{L})$$\nExpanding the product and neglecting the second-order differential term $(dC_{L})(df_{L})$, we obtain:\n$$C_{L} f_{L} \\approx (C_{L} f_{L} + C_{L} df_{L} + f_{L} dC_{L}) - C_{S} df_{L}$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the fundamental differential equation for solute redistribution:\n$$f_{L} dC_{L} = (C_{S} - C_{L}) df_{L}$$\nThis equation represents the mass conservation of the solute during the differential solidification step. The term on the left is the change in solute content in the liquid due to the change in its composition, and the term on the right is the net change due to rejection or incorporation of solute at the interface.\n\nNow, we apply the Scheil assumptions. The liquid is assumed to be perfectly mixed, so $C_{L}$ is uniform throughout the liquid at any given time. We substitute the definition of the partition coefficient, $C_{S} = k C_{L}$, into the differential equation:\n$$f_{L} dC_{L} = (k C_{L} - C_{L}) df_{L} = C_{L}(k-1) df_{L}$$\nWe can now separate variables to solve for $C_{L}$ as a function of $f_{L}$:\n$$\\frac{dC_{L}}{C_{L}} = (k-1) \\frac{df_{L}}{f_{L}}$$\nTo solve this ordinary differential equation, we integrate between the initial state and an arbitrary state during solidification. At the beginning of solidification, $f_{S} = 0$, thus $f_{L} = 1$, and the liquid composition is the initial overall composition, $C_{L} = C_{0}$. At a later stage, the liquid fraction is $f_{L}$ and its composition is $C_{L}$.\n$$\\int_{C_{0}}^{C_{L}} \\frac{dC'_{L}}{C'_{L}} = (k-1) \\int_{1}^{f_{L}} \\frac{df'_{L}}{f'_{L}}$$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$[\\ln(C'_{L})]_{C_{0}}^{C_{L}} = (k-1) [\\ln(f'_{L})]_{1}^{f_{L}}$$\n$$\\ln(C_{L}) - \\ln(C_{0}) = (k-1) (\\ln(f_{L}) - \\ln(1))$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, we have:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{L}}{C_{0}}\\right) = (k-1) \\ln(f_{L}) = \\ln(f_{L}^{k-1})$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the liquid composition profile:\n$$C_{L} = C_{0} f_{L}^{k-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the instantaneous solid composition, $C_{S}(f_{S})$. Using $C_{S} = k C_{L}$ and $f_{L} = 1 - f_{S}$, we arrive at the Scheil equation:\n$$C_{S}(f_{S}) = k C_{0} (1 - f_{S})^{k-1}$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the exact volume-average composition of the solid, $\\bar{C}_{S}$, after complete solidification. This is obtained by integrating the instantaneous solid composition, $C_{S}(f_{S})$, over the entire range of the solid fraction, from $f_{S} = 0$ to $f_{S} = 1$:\n$$\\bar{C}_{S} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{1} C_{S}(f_{S}) \\, df_{S}}{\\int_{0}^{1} df_{S}} = \\int_{0}^{1} C_{S}(f_{S}) \\, df_{S}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $C_{S}(f_{S})$:\n$$\\bar{C}_{S} = \\int_{0}^{1} k C_{0} (1 - f_{S})^{k-1} df_{S}$$\nTo evaluate this integral, let $u = 1 - f_{S}$. Then $du = -df_{S}$. The limits of integration change from $f_{S}=0 \\to u=1$ and $f_{S}=1 \\to u=0$.\n$$\\bar{C}_{S} = \\int_{1}^{0} k C_{0} u^{k-1} (-du) = k C_{0} \\int_{0}^{1} u^{k-1} du$$\nSince $k = 0.32 > 0$, the integral converges.\n$$\\bar{C}_{S} = k C_{0} \\left[ \\frac{u^{k}}{k} \\right]_{0}^{1} = C_{0} [u^{k}]_{0}^{1} = C_{0} (1^{k} - 0^{k})$$\n$$\\bar{C}_{S} = C_{0} (1 - 0) = C_{0}$$\n\nThe result that the average composition of the fully solidified ingot, $\\bar{C}_{S}$, is equal to the initial composition, $C_{0}$, is not a coincidence but a direct and necessary consequence of the principle of conservation of mass. The model assumes a closed system where no solute is created, destroyed, or lost. Therefore, all the solute initially present in the liquid alloy must be incorporated into the final solid ingot. The integration simply confirms this fundamental physical law. The problem's query about whether the average composition deviates from $C_{0}$ is a conceptual test. Under the stated assumptions, there can be no deviation for the ingot as a whole. The Scheil model describes microsegregation, where the local composition varies significantly throughout the solid—the first solid to form has composition $C_{S}(0) = kC_{0}$, while the last solid to form has a composition that is highly enriched in solute. However, the solute-depleted regions and solute-enriched regions must average out to the initial composition $C_{0}$ over the entire volume.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the numeric result for the average composition using the provided parameter $C_{0} = 0.083217$.\n$$\\bar{C}_{S} = C_{0} = 0.083217$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.08322$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08322}$$", "id": "2534067"}]}
