The components are defined as the minimum number of chemically independent species needed to describe the composition of all phases. This number is equivalent to the rank of the elemental composition matrix, also known as the stoichiometry matrix. The conserved elements are iron ($\\text{Fe}$) and oxygen ($\\text{O}$).\n\nFirst, we construct the stoichiometry matrix, $A$. The rows of this matrix correspond to the conserved elements, $\\text{Fe}$ and $\\text{O}$. The columns correspond to the given species in the specified order: $\\text{Fe}(s)$, $\\text{FeO}(s)$, $\\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}(s)$, $\\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}(s)$, and $\\text{O}_{2}(g)$.

The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns (or rows), which is equivalent to the maximum number of linearly independent columns (or rows). An $m \\times n$ matrix has a rank of at most $\\min(m, n)$. In this case, the matrix is $2 \\times 5$, so the maximum possible rank is $\\min(2, 5) = 2$.\n\nTo determine if the rank is indeed $2$, we must check if the two row vectors are linearly independent. Let the row vectors be $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$r_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  3  2  0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$r_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  4  3  2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTwo vectors are linearly independent if neither is a scalar multiple of the other. We check if there exists a scalar $k$ such that $r_1 = k \\cdot r_2$.\nComparing the first elements: $1 = k \\cdot 0$, which is impossible for any scalar $k$.\nSimilarly, for $r_2 = k \\cdot r_1$, comparing the fifth elements gives $2 = k \\cdot 0$, which is also impossible.\nTherefore, the two row vectors are linearly independent.\n\nAlternatively, we can find a $2 \\times 2$ submatrix of $A$ with a non-zero determinant. Let us consider the submatrix formed by the first two columns:\n$$\nA_{1,2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this submatrix is $\\det(A_{1,2}) = (1)(1) - (1)(0) = 1$. Since the determinant is non-zero, the columns are linearly independent, and the rank of the matrix $A$ is at least $2$. As the maximum possible rank is $2$, we conclude that the rank of $A$ is exactly $2$.\n\nThe number of components, $C$, in the system is equal to the rank of the stoichiometry matrix. Thus, $C = \\text{rank}(A) = 2$.\n\nTo justify this result, we must demonstrate that a minimal set of $2$ components can be used to form all other species in the system. A valid set of components corresponds to a set of linearly independent columns in the matrix $A$. A chemically intuitive choice for the components is elemental iron, $\\text{Fe}(s)$, and molecular oxygen, $\\text{O}_{2}(g)$. The corresponding columns in matrix $A$ are column $1$ and column $5$:\n$$\n\\text{v}_{\\text{Fe}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{v}_{\\text{O}_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThese two vectors are clearly linearly independent. We now express the remaining species ($\\text{FeO}$, $\\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}$, $\\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$) as linear combinations of these components. This is equivalent to writing the formation reactions.\n\nFor $\\text{FeO}(s)$: We require $x \\cdot \\text{Fe} + y \\cdot \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{FeO}$.\nIn terms of elemental conservation, this is $$x \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + y \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$x = 1$\n$2y = 1 \\implies y = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThe reaction is: $\\text{Fe} + \\frac{1}{2}\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{FeO}$.\n\nFor $\\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}(s)$: We require $x \\cdot \\text{Fe} + y \\cdot \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}$.\nIn vector form: $$x \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + y \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$x = 3$\n$2y = 4 \\implies y = 2$\nThe reaction is: $3\\text{Fe} + 2\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}$.\n\nFor $\\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}(s)$: We require $x \\cdot \\text{Fe} + y \\cdot \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$.\nIn vector form: $$x \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + y \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$x = 2$\n$2y = 3 \\implies y = \\frac{3}{2}$\nThe reaction is: $2\\text{Fe} + \\frac{3}{2}\\text{O}_{2} \\rightarrow \\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$.\n\nSince all other species in the system can be defined by chemical reactions involving only the chosen components $\\text{Fe}(s)$ and $\\text{O}_{2}(g)$, the set $\\{\\text{Fe}, \\text{O}_2\\}$ constitutes a valid component set.

From the liquidus equation:\n$T_{L} = T_{A} + m_{L}x_{0}$.\nSolidification is complete at $T_{S}$, where $f_{S}=1$. At this temperature, the solid composition equals the overall alloy composition, $x_{B}^{S} = x_{0}$. From the solidus equation:\n$T_{S} = T_{A} + m_{S}x_{0}$.\nThe derived expression for $f_{S}(T)$ is valid for the temperature interval $[T_{S}, T_{L}]$.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $T_{A} = 933 \\text{ K}$, $m_{L} = -180 \\text{ K}$, $m_{S} = -360 \\text{ K}$, and $x_{0} = 0.08$.\nFirst, we determine the temperature interval:\n$$T_{L} = 933 + (-180)(0.08) = 933 - 14.4 = 918.6 \\text{ K}$$\n$$T_{S} = 933 + (-360)(0.08) = 933 - 28.8 = 904.2 \\text{ K}$$\nThe expression for $f_{S}(T)$ is valid for $T \\in [904.2 \\text{ K}, 918.6 \\text{ K}]$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values into the expression for $f_{S}(T)$:\n$$f_{S}(T) = \\left(\\frac{(-180)(0.08)}{T - 933} - 1\\right) \\frac{-360}{-180 - (-360)}$$\n$$f_{S}(T) = \\left(\\frac{-14.4}{T - 933} - 1\\right) \\frac{-360}{180}$$\n$$f_{S}(T) = \\left(\\frac{-14.4}{T - 933} - 1\\right) (-2)$$\n$$f_{S}(T) = \\frac{28.8}{T - 933} + 2$$\nTo obtain a single closed-form expression as a rational function, we combine the terms:\n$$f_{S}(T) = \\frac{28.8 + 2(T - 933)}{T - 933} = \\frac{28.8 + 2T - 1866}{T - 933}$$\n$$f_{S}(T) = \\frac{2T - 1837.2}{T - 933}$$\nThis is the required dimensionless decimal function for the fraction solid, valid for $T$ in Kelvin over the interval $[904.2, 918.6]$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{2T - 1837.2}{T - 933} } $$", "id": "2659887"}]}
