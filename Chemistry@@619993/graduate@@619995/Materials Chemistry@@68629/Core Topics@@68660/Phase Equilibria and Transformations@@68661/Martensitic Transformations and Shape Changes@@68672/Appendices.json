It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of physical metallurgy and continuum mechanics, specifically the Bain model of martensitic transformation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe Bain transformation model posits that the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of austenite can be transformed into a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure of ferrite (or martensite) by a homogeneous deformation. This deformation can be visualized by considering a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) cell embedded within the FCC lattice. The principal axes of this deformation are given as the orthogonal directions $[110]_{\\gamma}$, $[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma}$, and $[001]_{\\gamma}$ in the parent austenite ($\\gamma$) phase.\n\nLet the FCC lattice parameter be denoted by $a_{\\gamma}$. We construct a BCT unit cell within the FCC lattice such that its axes are aligned with the specified principal directions. The basis vectors of this BCT cell can be defined in the Cartesian coordinate system of the FCC cell.\nThe first two axes of the BCT cell lie in the basal plane of the FCC cell, along the face diagonals. The side lengths of this BCT cell, which we denote as $L_1$ and $L_2$, are equal to the distance from a corner atom to a face-center atom in the FCC lattice. This length is half the face diagonal.\n$L_1 = L_2 = \\sqrt{(\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2})^{2} + (\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2})^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a_{\\gamma}^2}{4}} = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThese lengths correspond to the initial, undeformed lengths along the $[110]_{\\gamma}$ and $[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma}$ directions.\n\nThe third axis of the BCT cell is aligned with the $[001]_{\\gamma}$ direction, which is an edge of the FCC cubic cell. The length of this side, $L_3$, is simply the FCC lattice parameter.\n$L_3 = a_{\\gamma}$.\nThis embedded cell has a tetragonality ratio $c/a = L_3 / L_1 = a_{\\gamma} / (a_{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe Bain deformation transforms this BCT cell into the final BCC structure. A BCC structure can itself be viewed as a BCT cell with a tetragonality ratio of $1$. Thus, the final lengths of the cell sides, $L'_1$, $L'_2$, and $L'_3$, are all equal to the BCC lattice parameter, $a_{\\alpha}$.\n$L'_1 = L'_2 = L'_3 = a_{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe principal stretches, $\\lambda_{1}$, $\\lambda_{2}$, and $\\lambda_{3}$, are defined as the ratios of the final lengths to the initial lengths along each of the principal axes.\n\nFor the stretch along the $[110]_{\\gamma}$ direction:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{L'_1}{L_1} = \\frac{a_{\\alpha}}{a_{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}a_{\\alpha}}{a_{\\gamma}} $$\n\nFor the stretch along the $[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma}$ direction:\n$$ \\lambda_2 = \\frac{L'_2}{L_2} = \\frac{a_{\\alpha}}{a_{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}a_{\\alpha}}{a_{\\gamma}} $$\n\nFor the stretch along the $[001]_{\\gamma}$ direction:\n$$ \\lambda_3 = \\frac{L'_3}{L_3} = \\frac{a_{\\alpha}}{a_{\\gamma}} $$\n\nWe are given the lattice parameters: $a_{\\gamma} = 3.60\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and $a_{\\alpha} = 2.88\\,\\text{\\AA}$.

The FCC unit cell has volume $a_{\\gamma}^3$ and contains $4$ atoms. The BCC unit cell has volume $a_{\\alpha}^3$ and contains $2$ atoms.

The problem is assessed to be valid: it is scientifically grounded, mathematically well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions or missing pieces of information.

For a simple laminate composed of two phases with deformation gradients $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ and respective volume fractions $\\theta$ and $1-\\theta$, where the layers are normal to a unit vector $\\mathbf{n}$, the macroscopic or average deformation gradient $\\bar{F}$ is given by the weighted arithmetic mean:\n$$\n\\bar{F} = \\theta F_{1} + (1-\\theta) F_{2}\n$$\nThis formula arises from averaging the displacement gradient field over a representative volume element under the assumption of uniform deformation within each layer parallel to the interface plane.\n\nThe deformation gradients for the two martensitic variants are given as:\n$$\nF_{1}=I+\\gamma\\,\\mathbf{a}\\otimes\\mathbf{n}\n$$\n$$\nF_{2}=I-\\beta\\,\\mathbf{a}\\otimes\\mathbf{n}\n$$\nHere, $I$ is the second-order identity tensor, $\\mathbf{a}=\\mathbf{e}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{e}_{2}$ are specified as orthogonal unit vectors, and the shear magnitudes are given as $\\gamma=0.12$ and $\\beta=0.08$.\n\nFirst, we verify the kinematic compatibility of these two variants across an interface with normal $\\mathbf{n}$. The Hadamard jump condition requires that the difference between the deformation gradients is a rank-one tensor of the form $\\mathbf{c} \\otimes \\mathbf{n}$ for some vector $\\mathbf{c}$.
