It is well-posed, with all necessary data provided for the calculation of phase fractions using the lever rule, which is a direct consequence of mass conservation. The a priori validation process confirms that the problem is complete, consistent, and objective. We shall now proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relations for phase fractions from fundamental principles. The governing principles are the conservation of total moles and the conservation of moles for each component in the system.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the total number of moles in the macroscopic alloy specimen. Let $N_{\\alpha}$ and $N_{\\beta}$ be the total number of moles in phase $\\alpha$ and phase $\\beta$, respectively. By definition, the system consists only of these two phases, so the conservation of total moles requires:\n$$N_0 = N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta}$$\nDividing this equation by $N_0$ gives a relation between the mole fractions of the phases, $f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_0}$ and $f_{\\beta} = \\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_0}$:\n$$1 = \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_0} + \\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_0}$$\n$$f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\beta} = 1 \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of matter to component B. The total number of moles of component B in the system, which we denote as $N_{B,0}$, must be equal to the sum of the moles of B in phase $\\alpha$ ($N_{B, \\alpha}$) and the moles of B in phase $\\beta$ ($N_{B, \\beta}$).\n$$N_{B,0} = N_{B, \\alpha} + N_{B, \\beta}$$\n\nThe mole fraction of a component in any phase or in the overall system is defined as the number of moles of that component divided by the total number of moles in that phase or system. We are given the following mole fractions for component B:\n-   Overall mole fraction: $x_0 = \\frac{N_{B,0}}{N_0}$\n-   Mole fraction in phase $\\alpha$: $x_{\\alpha} = \\frac{N_{B, \\alpha}}{N_{\\alpha}}$\n-   Mole fraction in phase $\\beta$: $x_{\\beta} = \\frac{N_{B, \\beta}}{N_{\\beta}}$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the number of moles of B in each part of the system:\n-   $N_{B,0} = x_0 N_0$\n-   $N_{B, \\alpha} = x_{\\alpha} N_{\\alpha}$\n-   $N_{B, \\beta} = x_{\\beta} N_{\\beta}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the conservation equation for component B gives:\n$$x_0 N_0 = x_{\\alpha} N_{\\alpha} + x_{\\beta} N_{\\beta}$$\n\nTo obtain a relation in terms of phase fractions, we divide this entire equation by the total number of moles, $N_0$:\n$$x_0 \\frac{N_0}{N_0} = x_{\\alpha} \\frac{N_{\\alpha}}{N_0} + x_{\\beta} \\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_0}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $f_{\\alpha}$ and $f_{\\beta}$ yields the second key relation:\n$$x_0 = x_{\\alpha} f_{\\alpha} + x_{\\beta} f_{\\beta} \\quad (2)$$\nIt should be noted that this derivation, based only on mass conservation, is general and does not depend on the assumption of \"ideal substitutional behavior.\"\n\nWe now possess a system of two linear equations, (1) and (2), with two unknowns, $f_{\\alpha}$ and $f_{\\beta}$.

From the first equation, we express $f_L^+$ as $f_L^+ = 1 - f_\\alpha^+$. Substituting this into the second equation yields:\n$$(1 - f_\\alpha^+) C_L^\\uparrow + f_\\alpha^+ C_\\alpha^\\uparrow = C_0$$\n$$C_L^\\uparrow - f_\\alpha^+ C_L^\\uparrow + f_\\alpha^+ C_\\alpha^\\uparrow = C_0$$\nRearranging to solve for $f_\\alpha^+$:\n$$f_\\alpha^+ (C_\\alpha^\\uparrow - C_L^\\uparrow) = C_0 - C_L^\\uparrow$$\n$$f_\\alpha^+ = \\frac{C_0 - C_L^\\uparrow}{C_\\alpha^\\uparrow - C_L^\\uparrow} = \\frac{C_L^\\uparrow - C_0}{C_L^\\uparrow - C_\\alpha^\\uparrow}$$\nThis is the lever rule expression for the fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase.

For this binary alloy, $C=2$.\nIn the two-phase regions ($L+\\alpha$ and $\\alpha+\\beta$), $P=2$, so $F=2-2+1=1$. Temperature can be varied, and the compositions of the equilibrium phases adjust accordingly.\nAt the peritectic temperature $T_p$, three phases ($L$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$) coexist in equilibrium.

The system transitions from an ($L+\\alpha$) equilibrium to an ($\\alpha+\\beta$) equilibrium. The lever rule, which determines phase fractions, is applied to two different tie-lines. Above $T_p$, the tie-line endpoints are $C_\\alpha^p$ and $C_L^p$. Below $T_p$, they are $C_\\alpha^p$ and $C_\\beta^p$. Since $C_L^p \\neq C_\\beta^p$, the calculation of the phase fraction $f_\\alpha$ uses a different set of compositions, leading to a discontinuous jump in its value even though the overall composition $C_0$ remains constant.\n\nFinally, we compute the signed discontinuity $\\Delta f_\\alpha = f_\\alpha^- - f_\\alpha^+$.\n$$\\Delta f_\\alpha = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{9}{13} = \\frac{13}{39} - \\frac{27}{39} = -\\frac{14}{39}$$\nThe problem requires a numerical value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta f_\\alpha = -\\frac{14}{39} \\approx -0.35897435...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $-0.3590$.

First, we compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 0.70(0.65 \\times 1 - 0.25 \\times 1) - 0.15(0.20 \\times 1 - 0.25 \\times 1) + 0.10(0.20 \\times 1 - 0.65 \\times 1) $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 0.70(0.40) - 0.15(-0.05) + 0.10(-0.45) = 0.28 + 0.0075 - 0.045 = 0.2425 $$\nNow we find the determinants of the matrices for each variable:\nFor $f_{\\alpha}$, we replace the first column of $\\mathbf{A}$ with $\\mathbf{b}$:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\alpha}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0.226 & 0.15 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.398 & 0.65 & 0.25 \\\\ 0.820 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\alpha}) = 0.226(0.65 - 0.25) - 0.15(0.398 - 0.205) + 0.10(0.398 - 0.533) $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\alpha}) = 0.226(0.40) - 0.15(0.193) + 0.10(-0.135) = 0.0904 - 0.02895 - 0.0135 = 0.04795 $$\nSo, $f_{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\alpha})}{\\det(\\mathbf{A})} = \\frac{0.04795}{0.2425} = \\frac{959}{4850} \\approx 0.1977319...$\n\nFor $f_{\\beta}$, we replace the second column of $\\mathbf{A}$ with $\\mathbf{b}$:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\beta}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0.70 & 0.226 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.398 & 0.25 \\\\ 1 & 0.820 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\beta}) = 0.70(0.398 - 0.205) - 0.226(0.20 - 0.25) + 0.10(0.164 - 0.398) $$\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\beta}) = 0.70(0.193) - 0.226(-0.05) + 0.10(-0.234) = 0.1351 + 0.0113 - 0.0234 = 0.123 $$\nSo, $f_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\det(\\mathbf{A}_{\\beta})}{\\det(\\mathbf{A})} = \\frac{0.123}{0.2425} = \\frac{246}{485} \\approx 0.5072164...$\n\nFor $f_{\\gamma}$, we can use the sum of fractions:\n$$ f_{\\gamma} = 0.82 - f_{\\alpha} - f_{\\beta} = \\frac{41}{50} - \\frac{959}{4850} - \\frac{246}{485} $$\nUsing a common denominator of $4850$:\n$$ f_{\\gamma} = \\frac{41 \\times 97}{4850} - \\frac{959}{4850} - \\frac{246 \\times 10}{4850} = \\frac{3977 - 959 - 2460}{4850} = \\frac{558}{4850} = \\frac{279}{2425} \\approx 0.1150515... $$\nThe total fraction of solids is $f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\beta} + f_{\\gamma} \\approx 0.19773 + 0.50722 + 0.11505 = 0.82$. The calculation is consistent.\n\nFinally, we round the required values to four significant figures:\n$f_{\\alpha} \\approx 0.1977$\n$f_{\\beta} \\approx 0.5072$\n$f_{\\gamma} \\approx 0.1151$\n\nThese values represent the mole fractions of the solid phases $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ in the alloy at temperature $T_e$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1977 & 0.5072 & 0.1151\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2494349"}]}
