The given values are physically plausible for a metallic single crystal. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the resolved shear stress, $\\tau_R$. Let the uniaxial tensile stress be applied along a specific direction, which we define by the unit vector $\\mathbf{e}_L$. The magnitude of the applied stress is $\\sigma$. The Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, which describes the state of stress in the material, can be written for this uniaxial case as the dyadic product of the loading direction vector with itself, scaled by the stress magnitude:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{e}_L \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_L) $$\nThe traction vector, $\\mathbf{t}$, on a plane with a unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is given by the Cauchy traction formula:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} $$\nIn this problem, the plane of interest is the slip plane. Substituting the expression for the stress tensor:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = (\\sigma (\\mathbf{e}_L \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_L)) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{e}_L $$\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ represents the cosine of the angle between the loading axis and the slip plane normal. The problem defines this angle as $\\phi$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\cos\\phi$. The traction vector on the slip plane is:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\sigma \\cos\\phi \\, \\mathbf{e}_L $$\nThe resolved shear stress, $\\tau_R$, is the scalar component of this traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ projected onto the slip direction, which is defined by the unit vector $\\mathbf{s}$. This projection is calculated by the dot product of $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{t}$:\n$$ \\tau_R = (\\sigma \\cos\\phi \\, \\mathbf{e}_L) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\sigma \\cos\\phi \\, (\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{s}) $$\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$ is the cosine of the angle between the loading axis and the slip direction. The problem defines this angle as $\\lambda$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\cos\\lambda$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tau_R$ yields the final derived expression, known as Schmid's Law:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\sigma \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate whether yielding occurs for an applied tensile stress of $\\sigma=150\\ \\text{MPa}$. The orientation factor is given as $m = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda = 0.18$. The resolved shear stress can be calculated as:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\sigma m $$\nUsing the given values:\n$$ \\tau_R = (150\\ \\text{MPa}) \\times 0.18 = 27\\ \\text{MPa} $$\nYielding initiates when the resolved shear stress $\\tau_R$ reaches or exceeds the critical resolved shear stress $\\tau_c$.

It remains in the elastic regime.\n\nThe final task is to determine the minimum uniaxial tensile stress, $\\sigma_y$, required to initiate yielding in this crystal orientation. Yielding occurs at the precise moment when the resolved shear stress equals the critical resolved shear stress:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\tau_c $$\nUsing the Schmid's Law relationship, $\\tau_R = \\sigma_y m$:\n$$ \\sigma_y m = \\tau_c $$\nSolving for the yield stress $\\sigma_y$:\n$$ \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\tau_c}{m} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $\\tau_c = 30\\ \\text{MPa}$ and $m=0.18$:\n$$ \\sigma_y = \\frac{30\\ \\text{MPa}}{0.18} = \\frac{30}{18 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{3000}{18}\\ \\text{MPa} = \\frac{500}{3}\\ \\text{MPa} \\approx 166.666... \\text{MPa} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\sigma_y \\approx 167\\ \\text{MPa} $$\nThis is the minimum tensile stress required to activate the slip system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{167}\n$$", "id": "2511863"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how resolved shear stress dictates yielding, we now dissect the geometric component that links applied stress to the stress experienced on a slip system.

The Schmid factor is a geometric term that depends on the orientation of the slip system relative to the loading axis. It is defined as:\n$$ m = \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\lambda) $$\nHere, $\\phi$ is the angle between the loading axis and the normal to the slip plane, and $\\lambda$ is the angle between the loading axis and the slip direction.\n\nFor a cubic crystal system, a crystallographic direction $[uvw]$ can be represented by a vector $\\vec{d} = u\\hat{i} + v\\hat{j} + w\\hat{k}$, where $\\hat{i}$, $\\hat{j}$, and $\\hat{k}$ are unit vectors along the crystallographic axes $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$, respectively.

The loading axis is along the $[001]$ direction. Let this vector be $\\vec{L} = [001]$.\n$2$. The slip plane is $(111)$. The normal to a plane $(hkl)$ in a cubic system is the direction $[hkl]$. Therefore, the slip plane normal vector is $\\vec{N} = [111]$.\n$3$. The slip direction is $[\\bar{1}10]$. This corresponds to the vector $\\vec{S} = [-1, 1, 0]$.\n\nNow, we calculate the angles $\\phi$ and $\\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\phi$, the angle between the loading axis $\\vec{L}=[001]$ and the slip plane normal $\\vec{N}=[111]$.\n$$ \\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{N}}{|\\vec{L}| |\\vec{N}|} = \\frac{(0)(1) + (0)(1) + (1)(1)}{\\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1} \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate $\\lambda$, the angle between the loading axis $\\vec{L}=[001]$ and the slip direction $\\vec{S}=[-1, 1, 0]$.\n$$ \\cos(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{S}}{|\\vec{L}| |\\vec{S}|} = \\frac{(0)(-1) + (0)(1) + (1)(0)}{\\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{1} \\sqrt{2}} = 0 $$\n\nWith the values of $\\cos(\\phi)$ and $\\cos(\\lambda)$, we can now compute the Schmid factor $m$:\n$$ m = \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\lambda) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\cdot (0) = 0 $$\nA Schmid factor of $0$ indicates that there is zero resolved shear stress on the $(111)[\\bar{1}10]$ slip system for a tensile load applied along the $[001]$ axis. Physically, this is because the loading axis is orthogonal to the slip direction ($\\lambda=90^\\circ$), so the applied force has no component in the direction of slip.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the orientation that maximizes the magnitude of the resolved shear stress, which is equivalent to maximizing the Schmid factor $m = |\\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\lambda)|$. Let the loading axis, slip plane normal, and slip direction be represented by unit vectors $\\hat{\\sigma}$, $\\hat{n}$, and $\\hat{s}$ respectively. The slip direction $\\hat{s}$ lies within the slip plane, which is perpendicular to its normal $\\hat{n}$. This orthogonality condition means $\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{s} = 0$.\n\nLet $\\gamma$ be the angle between $\\hat{n}$ and $\\hat{s}$, so $\\gamma = 90^\\circ$. A general geometric constraint relates the three angles, $\\phi$, $\\lambda$, and $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\cos^2(\\phi) + \\cos^2(\\lambda) + \\cos^2(\\gamma) \\ge 1 $$\nSince $\\gamma=90^\\circ$, $\\cos(\\gamma)=0$, so we have $\\cos^2(\\phi) + \\cos^2(\\lambda) \\ge 1$. This inequality becomes an equality, $\\cos^2(\\phi) + \\cos^2(\\lambda) = 1$, only when the loading axis $\\hat{\\sigma}$ lies in the plane defined by $\\hat{n}$ and $\\hat{s}$.\nWe wish to maximize $m = \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\lambda)$. For simplicity, let's assume the angles are acute, so we maximize $m$. Let $\\cos^2(\\phi) = x$. Then $\\cos^2(\\lambda) \\ge 1-x$. The function to maximize is $m^2 = \\cos^2(\\phi) \\cos^2(\\lambda) = x \\cos^2(\\lambda)$.\nTo maximize this product, we should choose the minimal value for $\\cos^2(\\lambda)$, which is $1-x$. This corresponds to the case where $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is coplanar with $\\hat{n}$ and $\\hat{s}$.\nIn this coplanar case, $\\phi + \\lambda = 90^\\circ$, so $\\lambda = 90^\\circ - \\phi$.\nThe Schmid factor becomes:\n$$ m = \\cos(\\phi) \\cos(90^\\circ - \\phi) = \\cos(\\phi) \\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2\\phi) $$\nThis function is maximized when $\\sin(2\\phi)$ is maximized, which is $1$. This occurs when $2\\phi = 90^\\circ$, so $\\phi = 45^\\circ$.\nIf $\\phi = 45^\\circ$, then $\\lambda = 90^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 45^\\circ$.\n\nThus, the maximum possible value of the Schmid factor is achieved when the loading axis makes an angle of $45^\\circ$ with both the slip plane normal and the slip direction. The maximum value is:\n$$ m_{max} = \\cos(45^\\circ) \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nSo, the optimal orientation for slip is when the tensile axis is oriented at $45^\\circ$ to both the slip plane and the slip direction.\n\nFor the specific case requested in the problem, however, the calculated Schmid factor is decisively zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2511891"}, {"introduction": "Plastic deformation is fundamentally the motion of dislocations, and these line defects possess their own energy stored in the surrounding elastic strain field.
