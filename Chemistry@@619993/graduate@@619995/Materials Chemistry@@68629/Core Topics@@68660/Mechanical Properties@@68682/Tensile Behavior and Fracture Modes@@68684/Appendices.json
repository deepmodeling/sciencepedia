It is a valid problem in the field of materials chemistry and mechanics. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Survival Probability\nThe fundamental premise of weakest-link theory is that a specimen survives an applied stress $\\sigma$ if and only if it contains no flaws that are critical at that stress level.\n\nA flaw of half-length $a$ becomes critical when the stress intensity factor $K_I$ reaches the fracture toughness $K_{Ic}$. The critical condition is:\n$$Y \\,\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} = K_{Ic}$$\nFor a given applied stress $\\sigma$, any flaw with a half-length $a$ greater than or equal to a critical size, $a_{crit}(\\sigma)$, will cause catastrophic failure. We can solve for this critical size:\n$$a_{crit}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y\\sigma} \\right)^2$$\nThe specimen survives if the number of flaws with size $a \\ge a_{crit}(\\sigma)$ is exactly zero. The number of such flaws in a volume $V$ is a random variable that follows a Poisson distribution. The expected number of such flaws is given as $\\Lambda(V, a)$. For survival, we are interested in the number of flaws larger than $a_{crit}(\\sigma)$. The expected value is:\n$$\\Lambda(V, a_{crit}(\\sigma)) = \\lambda \\, V \\, [a_{crit}(\\sigma)]^{-\\beta}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $a_{crit}(\\sigma)$:\n$$\\Lambda(V, a_{crit}(\\sigma)) = \\lambda \\, V \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y\\sigma} \\right)^2 \\right]^{-\\beta}$$\n$$\\Lambda(V, a_{crit}(\\sigma)) = \\lambda \\, V \\, (\\pi^{-1})^{-\\beta} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y\\sigma} \\right)^2 \\right]^{-\\beta} = \\lambda \\, V \\, \\pi^{\\beta} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y\\sigma} \\right)^{-2\\beta}$$\n$$\\Lambda(V, a_{crit}(\\sigma)) = \\lambda \\, V \\, \\pi^{\\beta} \\left( \\frac{Y\\sigma}{K_{Ic}} \\right)^{2\\beta} = \\lambda \\, V \\, \\frac{\\pi^{\\beta} Y^{2\\beta} \\sigma^{2\\beta}}{K_{Ic}^{2\\beta}}$$\nThis can be rewritten by grouping the term $\\sqrt{\\pi}$:\n$$\\Lambda(V, a_{crit}(\\sigma)) = \\lambda \\, V \\, \\left( \\frac{Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}} \\right)^{2\\beta}$$\nThe survival probability, $P_s(\\sigma, V)$, is the probability of finding zero flaws of critical size or larger. For a Poisson process with mean $\\Lambda$, the probability of observing zero events is $P(k=0) = e^{-\\Lambda}$. Therefore:\n$$P_s(\\sigma,V) = \\exp \\left[ -\\Lambda(V, a_{crit}(\\sigma)) \\right] = \\exp\\left[-\\,\\lambda \\, V \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\,\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{2\\beta}\\right]$$\nThis expression is a two-parameter Weibull distribution for the failure stress $\\sigma$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The survival probability obeys $P_s(\\sigma,V) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\,\\lambda \\, V \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\,\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{2\\beta}\\right]$.**\nOur derived expression for the survival probability is identical to the one provided in this option. The derivation is a direct consequence of the problem's stated premises.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For any fixed quantile $0<\\eta<1$, the characteristic strength scales with volume as $\\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\propto V^{-1/(2\\beta)}$.**\nThe characteristic strength $\\sigma_{\\eta}(V)$ is defined by $\\mathbb{P}[\\text{failure at stress } \\sigma_{\\eta}(V)] = \\eta$. The probability of failure $P_f$ is $1 - P_s$. So, we have:\n$$P_f(\\sigma_{\\eta}(V), V) = 1 - P_s(\\sigma_{\\eta}(V), V) = \\eta$$\n$$P_s(\\sigma_{\\eta}(V), V) = 1 - \\eta$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_s$:\n$$\\exp\\left[-\\,\\lambda \\, V \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\,\\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{2\\beta}\\right] = 1 - \\eta$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\,\\lambda \\, V \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\,\\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{2\\beta} = \\ln(1 - \\eta)$$\nSince $0 < \\eta < 1$, the term $\\ln(1 - \\eta)$ is a negative constant. Let $C_{\\eta} = -\\ln(1 - \\eta) > 0$.\n$$\\lambda \\, V \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{2\\beta} \\left( \\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\right)^{2\\beta} = C_{\\eta}$$\nWe isolate the terms dependent on $V$:\n$$V \\, \\left( \\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\right)^{2\\beta} = \\frac{C_{\\eta}}{\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{Y \\sqrt{\\pi}} \\right)^{2\\beta} = \\text{Constant}$$\nTherefore, $\\left( \\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\right)^{2\\beta} \\propto V^{-1}$. Taking the root of power $2\\beta$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\eta}(V) \\propto (V^{-1})^{1/(2\\beta)} = V^{-1/(2\\beta)}$$\nThe statement is correct. This represents the statistical size effect, where larger specimens are weaker on average.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The exponent governing the stress dependence in $P_s(\\sigma,V)$ equals the flaw-size tail exponent $\\beta$ (not $2\\beta$), because $K_I \\propto \\sigma$.**\nAs shown in the derivation for option A, the survival probability takes the form $P_s(\\sigma, V) = \\exp[ -C \\cdot \\sigma^{2\\beta} ]$, where $C$ is a constant with respect to $\\sigma$. The exponent governing the stress dependence is definitively $2\\beta$. The reason for this is the chain of dependencies: the expected number of critical flaws $\\Lambda$ depends on the critical flaw size $a_{crit}$ as $\\Lambda \\propto (a_{crit})^{-\\beta}$, and the critical flaw size depends on stress as $a_{crit} \\propto \\sigma^{-2}$. Combining these gives $\\Lambda \\propto (\\sigma^{-2})^{-\\beta} = \\sigma^{2\\beta}$. The premise $K_I \\propto \\sigma$ is correct, but it is incomplete reasoning; it omits the crucial role of flaw size $a$ and its relation to stress at failure. The statement is factually incorrect about the exponent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In this setting, statistical tensile strength refers to a distribution of failure stresses across nominally identical specimens governed by the extreme value (the maximum) of the flaw-size population, not by the average flaw size.**\nThis statement correctly describes the physical and statistical basis of the model. Failure is a \"weakest-link\" phenomenon. It is initiated by the single most detrimental flaw, which is the one that first satisfies the failure criterion $K_I = K_{Ic}$. Under increasing stress $\\sigma$, for a population of flaws with different sizes $a$, the quantity $Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a}$ is maximized by the flaw with the largest value of $Y\\sqrt{a}$ (and for $Y \\approx 1$, this corresponds to the largest flaw size $a$). Thus, the overall strength is controlled by the statistics of the largest flaw in the specimen, not the average flaw. This is a problem of extreme value statistics, for which the Weibull distribution is a canonical result.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If the same flaw process were confined strictly to the specimen surface of area $A$ rather than the bulk, then for bulk uniaxial tension one still has $P_s(\\sigma,A) = \\exp\\!\\left[-\\,\\lambda \\, A \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\,\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{\\beta}\\right]$ because only the most severe flaws matter.**\nIf the flaws are confined to the surface, the problem formulation changes from a volume integral to a surface integral. The expected number of flaws larger than $a$ on a surface of area $A$ would be $\\Lambda_{surf}(A,a) = \\lambda_{surf} \\, A \\, a^{-\\beta_{surf}}$. The problem asks us to use the same constants, so we have $\\Lambda_{surf}(A,a) = \\lambda A a^{-\\beta}$. The derivation for the survival probability is formally identical to the bulk case, with volume $V$ replaced by area $A$. The dependence on stress arises from the same LEFM criterion: $a_{crit} \\propto \\sigma^{-2}$. Therefore, the argument of the exponential, $\\Lambda_{surf}(A, a_{crit})$, must exhibit the same stress dependence:\n$$\\Lambda_{surf}(A, a_{crit}) \\propto A \\cdot (a_{crit})^{-\\beta} \\propto A \\cdot (\\sigma^{-2})^{-\\beta} \\propto A \\cdot \\sigma^{2\\beta}$$\nThe correct expression should be $P_s(\\sigma,A) = \\exp\\left[-\\,\\lambda' \\, A \\left(\\dfrac{Y \\,\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi}}{K_{Ic}}\\right)^{2\\beta}\\right]$ for some surface-specific constant $\\lambda'$. The option incorrectly states the exponent on the stress-dependent term is $\\beta$, not $2\\beta$. The reasoning provided, \"because only the most severe flaws matter,\" is correct in principle but does not lead to the stated mathematical form.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2529018"}]}
