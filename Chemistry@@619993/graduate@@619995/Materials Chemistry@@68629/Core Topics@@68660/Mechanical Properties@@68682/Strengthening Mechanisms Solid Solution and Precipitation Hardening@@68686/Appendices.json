The provided information is self-contained and consistent, and the requested tasks follow a logical progression from fundamental principles to a numerical application. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the scaling relationship for inter-obstacle spacing $\\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we express the three-dimensional number density of precipitates, $N_{v}$, in terms of the volume fraction $f$ and precipitate radius $r$. The volume fraction $f$ is defined as the total volume of precipitates per unit volume of the alloy. For monodisperse spherical precipitates of radius $r$, the volume of a single precipitate is $V_{p} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}$. The volume fraction is thus given by the product of the number density and the volume per precipitate:\n$$f = N_{v} V_{p} = N_{v} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\right)$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $N_{v}$ yields:\n$$N_{v} = \\frac{f}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}} = \\frac{3f}{4\\pi r^{3}}$$\nNext, we determine the areal number density of precipitate intersections, $N_{A}$, on a random slip plane. The problem provides a stereological principle: the expected number of intersections of spheres with a random plane per unit area, $N_{A}$, is equal to the number density of sphere centers, $N_{v}$, within a slab of thickness $2r$. A sphere of radius $r$ with its center at a perpendicular distance $z$ from the plane will intersect the plane if and only if $|z| \\leq r$. Thus, all sphere centers located in a slab of volume $A \\times 2r$ (where $A$ is the area of the plane under consideration) will produce an intersection. The number of such centers is $N_{v} \\times (A \\times 2r)$. The areal density of intersections, $N_{A}$, is this number divided by the area $A$:\n$$N_{A} = \\frac{N_{v} \\cdot A \\cdot 2r}{A} = 2r N_{v}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{v}$ into this equation gives:\n$$N_{A} = 2r \\left(\\frac{3f}{4\\pi r^{3}}\\right) = \\frac{6rf}{4\\pi r^{3}} = \\frac{3f}{2\\pi r^{2}}$$\nThis result shows that the areal number density of intersections is directly proportional to the volume fraction $f$ and inversely proportional to the square of the radius $r$, i.e., $N_{A} \\propto f/r^{2}$.\n\nThe characteristic in-plane obstacle spacing, $\\lambda$, is related to the areal density of obstacles. In the simplest model, we can imagine the obstacles arranged on a square grid of side length $\\lambda$. In this case, the number of obstacles per unit area is $N_{A} = 1/\\lambda^{2}$, which implies $\\lambda = 1/\\sqrt{N_{A}}$. Although this is a simplification for a random array, the scaling relationship holds true for any statistical definition of mean spacing. Therefore, the characteristic spacing $\\lambda$ must scale as the inverse square root of $N_{A}$:\n$$\\lambda \\propto (N_{A})^{-1/2} \\propto \\left(\\frac{f}{r^{2}}\\right)^{-1/2} = (f^{-1/2})(r^{-2})^{-1/2} = r f^{-1/2}$$\nThis demonstrates that in the dilute limit, the inter-obstacle spacing is expected to scale linearly with the precipitate radius and inversely with the square root of the volume fraction.\n\nPart 2: Justification and interpretation of the closed-form expression for $\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem provides a specific closed-form expression for the inter-obstacle spacing:\n$$\\lambda \\approx r \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2 f}\\right)^{1/2}$$\nThis expression is a model-specific \"closure\" that relates the macroscopic parameter $f$ to the microscopic length scale $\\lambda$, which controls the dislocation bowing process. Justifying this specific form requires stating the assumptions inherent to the model it is derived from:\n1.  **Dilute Limit**: The volume fraction of precipitates is assumed to be small, i.e., $f \\ll 1$. This ensures that precipitates are, on average, far apart from each other, and the probability of precipitate overlap is negligible. The statistics of a random, non-overlapping distribution are simplified in this limit.\n2.  **Random Spatial Distribution**: The precipitates are treated as being randomly distributed in the matrix, often modeled as a Poisson point process in three dimensions. The intersections of these precipitates with the slip plane also form a random two-dimensional point pattern.\n3.  **Specific Statistical Model for Spacing**: The pre-factor $\\sqrt{\\pi/2}$ is not a universal constant but arises from a particular statistical model for averaging the effective distance between pinning points. Simple models like the square lattice approximation ($\\lambda = 1/\\sqrt{N_A}$) yield a different pre-factor ($ \\sqrt{2\\pi/3} \\approx 1.45$ vs. $\\sqrt{\\pi/2} \\approx 1.25$). The provided formula is a well-known result from more advanced statistical treatments (e.g., related to Friedel statistics or computer simulations of dislocation-obstacle interactions) which aim to find the effective average spacing that correctly predicts the mechanical strength for a random obstacle field. It represents a a specific choice for closing the geometric problem.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this expression is as follows. The Orowan strengthening mechanism provides an increase in yield strength, $\\Delta\\tau_{Orowan}$, that is inversely proportional to the spacing $\\lambda$ between the non-shearable precipitates: $\\Delta\\tau_{Orowan} \\propto 1/\\lambda$. The provided formula states that $\\lambda \\propto f^{-1/2}$. Therefore, as the volume fraction $f$ of precipitates is increased, the spacing $\\lambda$ between them on the slip plane decreases. A smaller spacing forces the dislocation line to adopt a more tightly bowed configuration between pinning points, which requires a higher applied stress to overcome. Consequently, increasing the volume fraction $f$ leads to a decrease in $\\lambda$ and a significant increase in the strength of the alloy.\n\nPart 3: Numerical calculation of $\\lambda$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of $\\lambda$ for a volume fraction $f = 0.04$ and a precipitate radius $r = 4\\,\\text{nm}$.
