The problem formulation is sound, self-contained, and scientifically valid. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system under consideration is a single, non-degenerate electronic orbital of energy $E$. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, this orbital can either be empty or occupied by a single electron. This defines two possible microstates for the system. We analyze these microstates within the framework of the grand canonical ensemble, where the system is at temperature $T$ and in contact with a reservoir of particles with chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\nLet us define the two microstates:\n$1$. The orbital is empty. In this state, the number of particles is $N_1=0$ and the energy is $\\mathcal{E}_1=0$. We take the energy of the empty state as the zero reference.\n$2$. The orbital is occupied by one electron. In this state, the number of particles is $N_2=1$ and the energy is $\\mathcal{E}_2=E$.\n\nThe statistical weight of a microstate $i$ with energy $\\mathcal{E}_i$ and particle number $N_i$ is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta(\\mathcal{E}_i - \\mu N_i))$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The grand canonical partition function, $\\mathcal{Z}$, is the sum of these statistical weights over all possible microstates. For this $2$-state system, $\\mathcal{Z}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\exp\\big(-\\beta(\\mathcal{E}_i - \\mu N_i)\\big)\n$$\nSubstituting the energies and particle numbers for our two microstates:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = \\exp\\big(-\\beta(\\mathcal{E}_1 - \\mu N_1)\\big) + \\exp\\big(-\\beta(\\mathcal{E}_2 - \\mu N_2)\\big)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = \\exp\\big(-\\beta(0 - \\mu \\cdot 0)\\big) + \\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu \\cdot 1)\\big)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = \\exp(0) + \\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big) = 1 + \\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)\n$$\nThe probability $P_i$ of the system being in microstate $i$ is the ratio of its statistical weight to the partition function:\n$$\nP_i = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{Z}} \\exp\\big(-\\beta(\\mathcal{E}_i - \\mu N_i)\\big)\n$$\nThe average occupation number $\\langle N \\rangle$ is the quantity requested, denoted as $f(E, \\mu, T)$. It is the statistical average of the particle number $N$, which is calculated by summing the product of the particle number for each state and the probability of that state:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} N_i P_i = (N_1 \\cdot P_1) + (N_2 \\cdot P_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = (0 \\cdot P_1) + (1 \\cdot P_2) = P_2\n$$\nThus, the average occupation probability $f(E, \\mu, T)$ is equal to the probability of the orbital being occupied (microstate $2$):\n$$\nf(E, \\mu, T) = P_2 = \\frac{\\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)}{1 + \\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)}\n$$\nTo obtain the standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp\\big(\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)$:\n$$\nf(E, \\mu, T) = \\frac{\\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big) \\cdot \\exp\\big(\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)}{\\big(1 + \\exp\\big(-\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)\\big) \\cdot \\exp\\big(\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big)} = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\big(\\beta(E - \\mu)\\big) + 1}\n$$\nThis is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, which completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this function at the specified energy, $E = \\mu + 3k_B T$. The exponent in the distribution function becomes:\n$$\n\\beta(E - \\mu) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\big((\\mu + 3k_B T) - \\mu\\big) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} (3k_B T) = 3\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $f(E, \\mu, T)$:\n$$\nf(\\mu + 3k_B T, \\mu, T) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(3) + 1}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the occupation probability at the specified energy.\n\nFinally, we interpret this value. The probability of finding an electron in this state is $P_{\\text{electron}} = f(E, \\mu, T) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(3) + 1}$. The state being empty corresponds to the presence of a \"hole\". The probability of finding a hole is the probability of the state being unoccupied, which is $P_{\\text{hole}} = 1 - P_{\\text{electron}}$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{hole}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\exp(3) + 1} = \\frac{(\\exp(3) + 1) - 1}{\\exp(3) + 1} = \\frac{\\exp(3)}{\\exp(3) + 1}\n$$\nTo determine which state is more likely, we compare $P_{\\text{electron}}$ and $P_{\\text{hole}}$. Since the denominators are identical and positive, we need only compare the numerators. The numerator for $P_{\\text{electron}}$ is $1$, and the numerator for $P_{\\text{hole}}$ is $\\exp(3)$. Since the mathematical constant $e \\approx 2.718$, we have $\\exp(3) \\approx (2.718)^3 > 20$, which is manifestly greater than $1$.\nTherefore, $P_{\\text{hole}} > P_{\\text{electron}}$. It is significantly more probable that the orbital is empty (contains a hole) than it is occupied by an electron.

The single-particle quantum states are plane waves, $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$. The application of periodic boundary conditions, $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$ and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ directions, imposes quantization on the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$. The components of the wavevector must satisfy $k_x = \\frac{2\\pi n_x}{L}$, $k_y = \\frac{2\\pi n_y}{L}$, and $k_z = \\frac{2\\pi n_z}{L}$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are any integers.\n\nThese allowed $\\mathbf{k}$ vectors form a discrete grid in reciprocal space (k-space). Each point on this grid, representing a unique orbital state, occupies a volume of $(\\frac{2\\pi}{L})^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}$. The density of these states in k-space is uniform and is given by the reciprocal of this volume: $\\rho_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi/L)^3} = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3}$.\n\nAt absolute zero temperature, $T=0\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the principles of Fermi-Dirac statistics dictate that electrons, being fermions, will occupy all available energy states up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $E_F$. All states with energy $E > E_F$ will be unoccupied. The Fermi-Dirac distribution function becomes a step function: $f(E) = 1$ for $E \\le E_F$ and $f(E) = 0$ for $E > E_F$.\n\nFor a free electron, the energy $E$ is related to the magnitude of its wavevector $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ by the dispersion relation $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_e}$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass. The Fermi energy $E_F$ thus corresponds to a maximum wavevector magnitude, the Fermi wavevector $k_F$, such that $E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m_e}$. Consequently, at $T=0\\ \\mathrm{K}$, all k-space points with $|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_F$ are occupied. These occupied states form a sphere in k-space, known as the Fermi sphere, which has a radius of $k_F$ and a volume of $\\mathcal{V}_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$.\n\nTo find the total number of occupied orbital states, $N_{states}$, we multiply the volume of the Fermi sphere by the density of states in k-space:\n$$ N_{states} = \\mathcal{V}_k \\times \\rho_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\\right) \\left(\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi k_F^3 V}{3 \\cdot 8\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} $$\nElectrons have spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, so according to the Pauli exclusion principle, each orbital state $\\mathbf{k}$ can accommodate two electrons: one with spin up and one with spin down.

Reciprocal space, or k-space, is the abstract space whose coordinates are the components of these wavevectors. At absolute zero temperature, the electrons occupy the lowest available energy states. Because the energy of a free electron is proportional to the square of the wavevector magnitude ($E \\propto k^2$), this means the electrons fill a sphere in k-space centered at the origin. The Fermi wavevector, $k_F$, is the radius of this sphere, which is known as the Fermi sphere. It represents the magnitude of the wavevector for the highest-energy occupied electron state at $T=0\\ \\mathrm{K}$. Thus, $k_F$ serves as the boundary that separates the occupied electronic states (for $|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_F$) from the unoccupied states (for $|\\mathbf{k}| > k_F$) in reciprocal space.

The problem is therefore not flawed, but rather assumes a standard level of contextual understanding. The problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe density of states (DOS) per unit area, $g(E)$, is defined such that for a sample of area $A$, the number of states $dN$ in an infinitesimal energy interval $dE$ is given by $dN = A g(E) dE$.
