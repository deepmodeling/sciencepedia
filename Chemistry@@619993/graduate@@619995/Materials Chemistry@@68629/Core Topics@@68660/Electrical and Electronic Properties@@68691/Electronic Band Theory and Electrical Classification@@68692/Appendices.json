This is the region of reciprocal space consisting of all points $\\mathbf{k}$ that are closer to the origin (the $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ lattice point) than to any other reciprocal lattice point $\\mathbf{G}$.

The objective is to determine if the Fermi sphere, with radius $k_F$, intersects the first BZ boundary. This is achieved by calculating the signed difference $\\Delta k = k_F - k_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$ is the minimum distance from the center of the BZ (the $\\Gamma$ point) to the BZ boundary.\n\nFirst, we determine the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$. In the free-electron model at zero temperature ($T=0$), the occupied electron states fill a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, known as the Fermi sphere, up to a radius $k_F$. The total number of electrons, $N$, in a crystal of volume $V$ can be related to $k_F$. The density of states in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is $V / (2\\pi)^3$.

The problem states that the metal has a BCC crystal structure. The conventional cubic unit cell of a BCC lattice has a volume $V_{\\mathrm{cell}} = a^3$ and contains $2$ atoms. With each atom contributing $z$ valence electrons to the free-electron gas, the number of electrons per conventional unit cell is $N_{\\mathrm{cell}} = 2z$. Therefore, the electron density is:\n$$n = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{cell}}}{V_{\\mathrm{cell}}} = \\frac{2z}{a^3}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $n$ into the equation for $k_F$:\n$$k_F = \\left(3\\pi^2 \\frac{2z}{a^3}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{a} (6\\pi^2 z)^{1/3}$$\nGiven that the valence per atom is $z=2$, the Fermi wavevector is:\n$$k_F = \\frac{1}{a} (12\\pi^2)^{1/3}$$\n\nNext, we determine the shortest distance from the $\\Gamma$ point to the first BZ boundary, $k_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$. The first BZ is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice. For a direct lattice that is BCC, the reciprocal lattice is face-centered cubic (FCC).

The BZ boundaries are planes that perpendicularly bisect the vectors $\\mathbf{G}$. The distance from the origin to a BZ boundary plane is $\\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}|$. To find the closest boundary, we must find the shortest non-zero reciprocal lattice vector, $|\\mathbf{G}|_{\\mathrm{min}}$. The magnitude squared of a vector $\\mathbf{G}$ is:\n$$|\\mathbf{G}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)$$\nWe seek to minimize $h^2+k^2+l^2$ for non-zero integers $h,k,l$ where $h+k+l$ is even. The smallest possible value for the sum of squares occurs for the set of integers $\\{1,1,0\\}$ and its permutations (e.g., $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$, $(1,-1,0)$, etc.). For these, $h+k+l = 2$ or $0$, which are even, and $h^2+k^2+l^2 = 1^2+1^2+0^2 = 2$. This gives the minimum non-zero magnitude:\n$$|\\mathbf{G}|_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 (2)} = \\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{a}$$\nThe shortest distance from the $\\Gamma$ point to the BZ boundary is half this length:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{BZ}} = \\frac{1}{2} |\\mathbf{G}|_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{a} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{a}$$\nThis distance corresponds to the center of the faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which forms the first BZ of the BCC lattice.\n\nFinally, we compute the signed gap $\\Delta k = k_F - k_{\\mathrm{BZ}}$.

This can be rigorously confirmed by analyzing the corresponding eigenvectors, which show in-phase and out-of-phase superpositions of the $|k,A\\rangle$ and $|k,B\\rangle$ states for the lower and upper bands, respectively.\n\nThe direct band gap at a given crystal momentum $k$ is the energy difference between the antibonding and bonding bands:\n$$ E_g(k) = E_{+}(k) - E_{-}(k) = 2\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B}{2}\\right)^2 + 4t^2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B)^2 + 16t^2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right)} $$\nTo find the minimum direct band gap, we must minimize $E_g(k)$ with respect to $k$ over the first Brillouin zone, $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$. The expression for $E_g(k)$ is minimized when the term $\\cos^2(ka/2)$ is minimized. The minimum value of $\\cos^2(x)$ is $0$. This occurs when its argument is an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$.\n$$ \\frac{ka}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi \\implies k = \\frac{\\pi}{a} + \\frac{2m\\pi}{a}, \\quad \\text{for integer } m $$\nWithin the first Brillouin zone, this condition is met at the zone boundaries, $k = \\pm \\pi/a$ (for $m=0$ and $m=-1$). At these points, $\\cos^2(\\pm \\pi/2) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting this minimum value into the expression for the band gap gives the minimum direct band gap, $E_g$:\n$$ E_g = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B)^2 + 16t^2(0)} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B)^2} = |\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B| $$\nThis result is physically intuitive. At the Brillouin zone edge, the effective hopping between the two sublattices vanishes, decoupling them. The energy levels revert to the original on-site energies, $\\epsilon_A$ and $\\epsilon_B$, and the gap becomes simply the magnitude of their difference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{|\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B|}$$", "id": "2485387"}]}
