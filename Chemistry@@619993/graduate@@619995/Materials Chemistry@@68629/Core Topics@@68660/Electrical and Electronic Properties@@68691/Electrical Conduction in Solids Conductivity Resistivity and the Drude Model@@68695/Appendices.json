We are concerned with the average momentum $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$ per electron, which gives rise to a net drift. The random thermal motions have an average momentum of zero. In the steady state, the average momentum of the electron gas does not change with time, thus $\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} = 0$.

The provided data values are physically realistic for a simple metal. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information and a clear set of objectives that lead to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which is composed of three parts.\n\nPart 1: Fitting the parameters $\\rho_{0}$ and $\\alpha$.\nThe problem states that the model $\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} + \\alpha T$ holds exactly for the given data. This implies the data points lie perfectly on a straight line in the $\\rho-T$ plane. We can therefore determine the slope $\\alpha$ and the intercept $\\rho_{0}$ using any two data points, which is simpler than performing a full linear regression. Let us use the first two data points: ($T_1 = 100\\ \\mathrm{K}, \\rho_1 = 1.82 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$) and ($T_2 = 150\\ \\mathrm{K}, \\rho_2 = 1.98 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nThe slope $\\alpha$ is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{\\rho_2 - \\rho_1}{T_2 - T_1} = \\frac{(1.98 - 1.82) \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{(150 - 100)\\ \\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{0.16 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{50\\ \\mathrm{K}} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe residual resistivity $\\rho_{0}$ can be found by substituting $\\alpha$ and one data point into the model. Using the first point:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} = \\rho_1 - \\alpha T_1 = 1.82 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m} - (3.2 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(100\\ \\mathrm{K})\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{0} = 1.82 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m} - 0.32 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThus, the fitted parameters are $\\alpha = 3.2 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $\\rho_{0} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation and microscopic interpretation.\nThe Drude model for electrical conductivity, $\\sigma$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{n e^2 \\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of conduction electrons, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m^{\\ast}$ is the electron effective mass, and $\\tau$ is the mean free time between scattering events. The electrical resistivity, $\\rho$, is the reciprocal of conductivity:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau}\n$$\nMatthiessen's rule states that for independent scattering mechanisms, the total scattering rate, $1/\\tau$, is the sum of the individual scattering rates. In a real metal, the dominant scattering mechanisms are:\n1.  Scattering from temperature-independent static lattice defects, such as impurities, vacancies, and grain boundaries. We denote this rate as $1/\\tau_{0}$.\n2.  Scattering from temperature-dependent lattice vibrations (phonons). We denote this rate as $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)$.\n\nAccording to Matthiessen's rule, the total scattering rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the resistivity expression gives:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)} \\right) = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau_{0}} + \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)}\n$$\nThis equation decomposes the total resistivity into two additive terms:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} + \\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)\n$$\nHere, we identify the microscopic meaning of the first term:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the residual resistivity, originating from scattering by static defects. It is independent of temperature.\n\nThe second term, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)$, is the temperature-dependent resistivity due to electron-phonon scattering. At high temperatures (typically above the Debye temperature), the number of phonons is proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. The scattering rate of electrons by phonons is also proportional to $T$. This is expressed by the given relation $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T) = A\\,T$, where $A$ is the electron-phonon scattering coefficient.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T) = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2} \\left( A\\,T \\right) = \\left( \\frac{m^{\\ast} A}{n e^2} \\right) T\n$$\nBy comparing this with the empirical linear model $\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} + \\alpha T$, we can identify the linear coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{m^{\\ast} A}{n e^2}\n$$\nThis coefficient $\\alpha$ represents the rate of increase of resistivity with temperature due to electron-phonon scattering. This completes the derivation and the interpretation.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the scattering coefficient $A$.\nFrom Part 2, we have the relationship $\\alpha = \\frac{m^{\\ast} A}{n e^2}$.

This yields:\n$$\n0 = -e\\vec{E} - \\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\tau} \\implies \\vec{p} = -e\\tau\\vec{E}\n$$\nThe drift velocity $\\vec{v}_{d}$ is the average velocity, related to the average momentum by $\\vec{v}_{d} = \\vec{p}/m^{\\ast}$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{d} = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\vec{E}\n$$\nThe electrical current density $\\vec{J}$ is defined as the product of the charge carrier density $n$, the charge per carrier $(-e)$, and the drift velocity $\\vec{v}_{d}$:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = n(-e)\\vec{v}_{d}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\vec{v}_{d}$:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = n(-e)\\left(-\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\vec{E}\\right) = \\frac{ne^{2}\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\vec{E}\n$$\nThis expression is the microscopic form of Ohm's law, $\\vec{J} = \\sigma\\vec{E}$, from which we identify the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{ne^{2}\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\n$$\nResistivity $\\rho$ is the reciprocal of conductivity, $\\rho = 1/\\sigma$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{ne^{2}\\tau}\n$$\nSolving for the relaxation time $\\tau$ gives the required expression:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{ne^{2}\\rho}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the mean free path $\\ell = v_{F}\\tau$. We must first calculate the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and the relaxation time $\\tau$ using the provided data.\nThe problem states $m^{\\ast} = m_{e} = 9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nWe calculate $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}}{(8.47 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.602\\,176\\,634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C})^{2}(1.68 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m})} \\approx 2.4942 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nTo find $v_{F}$, we first find the Fermi wave vector $k_{F}$:\n$$\nk_{F} = (3\\pi^{2}n)^{1/3} = (3\\pi^{2} \\times 8.47 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})^{1/3} \\approx 1.3585 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ is:\n$$\nv_{F} = \\frac{\\hbar k_{F}}{m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{(1.054\\,571\\,817 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})(1.3585 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1})}{9.109\\,383\\,7015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 1.5727 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe mean free path $\\ell$ is the product of the Fermi velocity and the relaxation time:\n$$\n\\ell = v_{F} \\tau = (1.5727 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(2.4942 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\approx 3.9229 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n\nThird, we evaluate the dimensionless Knudsen number, $\\mathrm{Kn} = \\ell / t$, and comment on its significance. The film thickness is given as $t = 25\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Kn} = \\frac{\\ell}{t} = \\frac{3.9229 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1.569\n$$\nThe Knudsen number $\\mathrm{Kn}$ compares the electron mean free path $\\ell$ to the characteristic physical dimension of the conductor, here the film thickness $t$.\nA value of $\\mathrm{Kn} > 1$ signifies that the mean free path is larger than the film thickness. In this regime, an electron is more likely to travel across the entire film thickness and scatter off a surface boundary than it is to scatter from impurities or phonons within the bulk of the film. Consequently, boundary scattering is expected to be a dominant, or at least a highly significant, scattering mechanism that contributes to the total resistivity. The fact that the problem uses a measured resistivity value to calculate an effective mean free path that turns out to be larger than the film thickness is internally consistent; it implies that the measured resistivity $\\rho$ is already enhanced above the true bulk value due to this classical size effect. Therefore, boundary scattering is indeed likely to be dominant.\n\nThe final task is to report the numerical value of $\\mathrm{Kn}$ rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Kn} \\approx 1.57\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.57}$$", "id": "2482868"}]}
