We begin from the fundamental principle of charge neutrality in a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. The total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density. The positive charges are holes, with concentration $p$, and ionized donor impurities, with concentration $N_D^+$. The negative charges are free electrons, with concentration $n$, and ionized acceptor impurities, with concentration $N_A^-$. The charge neutrality condition is therefore expressed as:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies that all dopant atoms are fully ionized. This is a common and reasonable assumption for typical dopants in silicon or germanium at room temperature ($T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$). This simplifies the ionized dopant concentrations to their total concentrations:\n$$N_D^+ = N_D$$\n$$N_A^- = N_A$$\nSubstituting these into the neutrality equation gives:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\nFor a non-degenerate semiconductor, the equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are related to the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ and the Fermi level $E_F$ relative to the intrinsic Fermi level $E_i$ by the following relations, which are derived from Boltzmann statistics:\n$$n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = n_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

We shall therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the Fermi wavevector, $k_{F}$. We consider a three-dimensional Fermi gas of electrons at zero temperature, $T=0$. In $k$-space, the volume occupied by a single quantum state for a crystal of volume $V$ is $\\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V}$. The states occupied by electrons form a sphere of radius $k_{F}$, known as the Fermi sphere.

This derivation starts from the linearized relation between the induced charge density, $\\delta\\rho$, and the electrostatic potential, $\\phi$, in a screening electron gas. This relation is given by:\n$$\n\\delta\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = -e^2 D(E_{F}) \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $D(E_{F})$ is the density of states (including spin) per unit volume at the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$. The total electrostatic potential $\\phi$ is determined by the Poisson equation, which relates the potential to the total charge density, $\\rho_{tot} = \\rho_{ext} + \\delta\\rho$, where $\\rho_{ext}$ is the external charge density (e.g., from an impurity ion).

The dimensionless parameter $S = k_{TF} a_{B}^{\\ast}$ is the ratio of the effective Bohr radius $a_{B}^{\\ast}$ to the Thomas-Fermi screening length $\\lambda_{TF} = k_{TF}^{-1}$. The value $S \\approx 2.003$ implies that $\\lambda_{TF} \\approx a_{B}^{\\ast}/2$. The screening length is the characteristic distance over which the electrostatic potential of a donor ion is attenuated by the surrounding free electron gas. The effective Bohr radius is the characteristic radius of a bound electron's orbit around an isolated donor. Since the screening length is significantly smaller than the would-be orbit radius ($\\lambda_{TF}  a_{B}^{\\ast}$), the attractive potential of the donor is so effectively screened that it becomes too weak and short-ranged to support a bound state. Consequently, the donor electrons are not localized to individual impurity atoms but are delocalized in the conduction band, forming a degenerate electron gas. This is the hallmark of the metallic state in a doped semiconductor, indicating that the system is well past the Mott metal-insulator transition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.003}\n$$", "id": "2521652"}]}
