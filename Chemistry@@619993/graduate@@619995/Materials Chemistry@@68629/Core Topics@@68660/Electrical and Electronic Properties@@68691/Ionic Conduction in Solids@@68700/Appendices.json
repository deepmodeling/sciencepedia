Thus, the ratio of concentrations of associated pairs to free dopants is approximately unity:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{DV}]}{[\\mathrm{D}]} \\approx 1\n$$\nThis ratio is approximately constant and does not contribute to the thermal activation energy. Substituting this result back into the expression for $[V](T)$:\n$$\n[V](T) \\approx \\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{assoc}}(T)} = \\frac{1}{K_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{assoc}}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe concentration of free carriers is thus thermally activated with an energy equal to the association enthalpy. This is the energy required to dissociate a pair and create a free vacancy.\n\nFinally, we combine the temperature dependencies of mobility and concentration to determine the apparent activation energy for conductivity.\n$$\n\\sigma(T) \\propto [V](T) \\mu_V(T)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(T) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{assoc}}}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_m}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(T) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_m + E_{\\mathrm{assoc}}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe conductivity follows an Arrhenius law, $\\sigma(T) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{app}}}{k_B T}\\right)$, where the apparent activation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{app}}$, is the sum of the migration enthalpy and the association enthalpy.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{app}} = H_m + E_{\\mathrm{assoc}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nH_m = 0.67 \\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{assoc}} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{app}} = 0.67 \\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.87 \\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
