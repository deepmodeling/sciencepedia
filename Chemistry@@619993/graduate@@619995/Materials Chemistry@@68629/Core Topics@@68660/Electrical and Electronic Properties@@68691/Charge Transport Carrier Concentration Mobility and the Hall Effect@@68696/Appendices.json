The contextual information about the metal being a monovalent face-centered cubic structure is consistent with the provided electron density $n = 8.5\\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. For an FCC lattice with lattice constant $a$, there are $4$ atoms per unit cell. If the metal is monovalent, the conduction electron density is $n = 4/a^3$. Using the given value of $n$, the implied lattice constant is $a = (4/n)^{1/3} = (4 / (8.5\\times 10^{28}))^{1/3} \\approx 3.61 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the direct-current (DC) conductivity, $\\sigma$. We start from Newton's second law for the average, or drift, velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ of a charge carrier. In the semiclassical relaxation-time approximation, the equation of motion for an electron with charge $-e$ and effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ in a static electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is given by:\n$$ m^{\\ast}\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_d}{dt} = -e\\mathbf{E} - \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_d $$\nThe term $-e\\mathbf{E}$ is the force exerted by the electric field, and the term $-\\frac{m^{\\ast}}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_d$ is a phenomenological damping force representing the net effect of scattering events, where $\\tau$ is the momentum-relaxation time. For a DC conductivity measurement, the system is in a steady state, which implies that the drift velocity is constant, and its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_d}{dt} = 0$. The equation of motion thus simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -e\\mathbf{E} - \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_d $$\nWe can solve this algebraic equation for the steady-state drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_d = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E} $$\nThe electric current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is defined as the product of the charge density and the drift velocity. For electrons with density $n$ and charge $-e$, this is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = n(-e)\\mathbf{v}_d $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{v}_d$ into the definition of $\\mathbf{J}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = n(-e)\\left(-\\frac{e\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E}\\right) = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m^{\\ast}}\\mathbf{E} $$\nThis equation is the microscopic form of Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma\\mathbf{E}$. By comparing our derived result with Ohm's law, we identify the expression for the DC conductivity $\\sigma$ as:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m^{\\ast}} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\sigma$ numerically using the provided data: $n = 8.5\\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $e = 1.602\\,176\\,634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, $\\tau = 2.5\\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $m^{\\ast} = 1.2\\,m_{e}$, where $m_{e} = 9.109\\,383\\,7015\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. First, we compute the effective mass:\n$$ m^{\\ast} = 1.2 \\times (9.109\\,383\\,7015\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\approx 1.0931 \\times 10^{-30}\\,\\mathrm{kg} $$\nNow we substitute the values into the formula for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{(8.5\\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}})(1.602\\,176\\,634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2(2.5\\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{1.2 \\times 9.109\\,383\\,7015\\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}} $$\n$$ \\sigma \\approx 4.98949 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the conductivity is $\\sigma \\approx 4.989 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$.\n\nThe third task is to estimate the mean free path, $\\ell$. This is the average distance an electron travels between scattering events. In the relaxation-time model, this distance is the product of the characteristic speed of the electron and the mean time between collisions, $\\tau$. The problem specifies using the Fermi velocity $v_F$ as this characteristic speed.\n$$ \\ell = v_F \\tau $$\nUsing the given values $v_{F} = 1.5\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and $\\tau = 2.5\\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$ \\ell = (1.5\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(2.5\\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 3.75 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ \\ell = (3.75 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 37.5\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the mean free path is $\\ell = 37.50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFinally, we assess whether this distance is large compared to a typical nearest-neighbor spacing of $d_{nn} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We compute the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\ell}{d_{nn}} = \\frac{37.50\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 150 $$\nThe mean free path is $150$ times the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal lattice. This is a significant result. It indicates that an electron does not simply bounce off every atom it encounters. Instead, within the quantum mechanical picture, the electron wave propagates freely through a perfect periodic lattice, and scattering only occurs due to deviations from this perfect periodicity, such as lattice vibrations (phonons) and impurities. At room temperature, scattering is dominated by phonons, and the calculated mean free path is a realistic value for a good metallic conductor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{37.50}$$", "id": "2472613"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models provide the expression for conductivity, experiments are essential for determining the key parameters within that expression, namely the carrier concentration $n$ and the sign of the charge carriers $q$.

This practice guides you through the analysis of a typical Hall measurement, allowing you to derive the carrier concentration from first principles and interpret the sign of the Hall voltage to identify whether electrons or holes dominate transport [@problem_id:2472634].", "problem": "A homogeneous, isotropic, single-carrier thin film carries a steady conventional current along the in-plane direction and is subjected to a uniform out-of-plane magnetic field.

It is scientifically sound and all necessary parameters are provided for a full derivation and calculation. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the Lorentz force law, which describes the force $\\mathbf{F}$ on a charge carrier with charge $q$ moving with drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ in the presence of an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ and a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_d \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nThe film lies in the $x$-$y$ plane, with a steady conventional current $I$ flowing along the $+x$ direction and a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ applied along the $+z$ direction.

This separation of charge establishes a transverse electric field, the Hall field $\\mathbf{E}_H = E_y \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$. This field, in turn, exerts an electric force on the carriers, $\\mathbf{F}_E = q\\mathbf{E}_H = qE_y \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\n\nIn the steady state, there is no net transverse current, which implies that the net force on the charge carriers in the $y$-direction must be zero. The equilibrium condition is thus $\\mathbf{F}_E + \\mathbf{F}_B = 0$, or in component form:\n$$\nqE_y - qv_x B = 0\n$$\nThis yields a direct relationship between the Hall field and the drift velocity:\n$$\nE_y = v_x B\n$$\nThe Hall voltage $V_H$ is defined as the potential difference between the two side edges, $V_H \\equiv V(y=+w/2) - V(y=-w/2)$, where $w$ is the width of the film. Assuming the Hall field $E_y$ is uniform across the width of the sample (as per the problem's simplifying assumptions), the voltage is related to the field by:\n$$\nV_H = -\\int_{-w/2}^{+w/2} E_y \\, dy = -E_y w\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_y$:\n$$\nV_H = -(v_x B) w = -v_x B w\n$$\nThe next step is to relate the drift velocity $v_x$ to the total current $I$. The definition of current density is $\\mathbf{J} = nq\\mathbf{v}_d$, where $n$ is the volumetric carrier concentration. For the given geometry, the current density component is $J_x = nqv_x$. The total current $I$ is the product of the current density and the cross-sectional area $A = wt$, where $t$ is the film thickness:\n$$\nI = J_x A = (nqv_x)(wt) = nqv_xwt\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the product $v_x w$:\n$$\nv_x w = \\frac{I}{nqt}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression into our equation for the Hall voltage:\n$$\nV_H = - \\left( \\frac{I}{nqt} \\right) B = -\\frac{IB}{nqt}\n$$\nThe problem requires an expression for the carrier concentration $n$. Rearranging the above formula, we find:\n$$\nn = -\\frac{IB}{qV_H t}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the volumetric carrier concentration. To proceed, we must determine the sign of the charge carriers. Let the charge of a carrier be $q = se$, where $s$ is its sign ($+1$ for positive carriers, $-1$ for negative carriers) and $e$ is the magnitude of the elementary charge. The concentration $n$ must be a positive quantity. All quantities on the right-hand side ($I$, $B$, $e$, $t$) are given as positive magnitudes. Therefore, for $n > 0$, the term $-1/(sV_H)$ must be positive, which implies the condition $sV_H < 0$.\n\nThe problem states a measured Hall voltage $V_H = 25\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.
