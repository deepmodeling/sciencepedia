For this potential, a planar interface at equilibrium has a profile $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\tanh(z/w))$. To satisfy the given constraints that the surface energy is $\\gamma$ and the interface thickness parameter is $w$, the coefficients $W_0$ and $\\kappa_{\\phi}$ are set as:\n$$\nW_0 = \\frac{12\\gamma}{w} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\kappa_{\\phi} = 3\\gamma w\n$$\nThus, the free energy functional is:\n$$\nF[\\phi] = \\int_V \\left( \\frac{12\\gamma}{w} \\phi^2(1-\\phi)^2 + \\frac{3}{2}\\gamma w |\\nabla\\phi|^2 \\right) dV\n$$\n\n**1.2. Chemical Potential**\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu$ (with units of energy per volume, $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$) is the variational derivative of the free energy functional with respect to the order parameter $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial f_{bulk}}{\\partial \\phi} - \\kappa_{\\phi} \\nabla^2\\phi = \\frac{24\\gamma}{w}\\phi(1-\\phi)(1-2\\phi) - 3\\gamma w \\nabla^2\\phi\n$$\n\n**1.3. Cahn-Hilliard Evolution Equation**\n\nThe evolution of the conserved order parameter $\\phi$ is given by $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_{total}$. The total flux $\\mathbf{J}_{total}$ is the sum of contributions from bulk diffusion ($\\mathbf{J}_v$) and surface diffusion ($\\mathbf{J}_s$). Following the principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics, these fluxes are proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{J}_v + \\mathbf{J}_s)\n$$\nThe bulk diffusion flux is isotropic:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_v = -M_v \\nabla\\mu\n$$\nwhere $M_v$ is the bulk phase-field mobility. The surface diffusion flux is restricted to the interface and acts tangentially. This is achieved by projecting the driving force onto the tangent plane of the interface using the projector $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{n} = \\nabla\\phi / |\\nabla\\phi|$ is the interface normal. The flux is also localized to the interface by a function of $\\phi$ or its gradient. The problem's unit requirement that both mobilities have units of $\\mathrm{m^5/(J \\cdot s)}$ constrains the form of the localization term. We choose a dimensionless localization factor $w^2|\\nabla\\phi|^2$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_s = -M_s w^2 |\\nabla\\phi|^2 (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{n}) \\nabla\\mu\n$$\nwhere $M_s$ is the surface phase-field mobility. The complete evolution equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( M_v \\nabla\\mu + M_s w^2 |\\nabla\\phi|^2 (\\mathbf{I} - \\frac{\\nabla\\phi \\otimes \\nabla\\phi}{|\\nabla\\phi|^2}) \\nabla\\mu \\right)\n$$\nThis form combines the two additive flux contributions as requested.\n\n**2. Asymptotic Reduction and Normal Velocity**\n\nIn the sharp-interface limit ($w \\to 0$), we relate the phase-field dynamics to the established physical laws governing sintering. The normal velocity of the interface, $v_n$, is the key quantity.\n\nThe physical chemical potential per atom, $\\mu_{at}$, is related to the mean curvature $\\kappa$ by the Gibbs-Thomson relation: $\\mu_{at} = \\mu_{at,0} + \\gamma\\Omega\\kappa$, where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume. The variational chemical potential $\\mu$ relates to the physical potential as $\\mu = (\\mu_{at} - \\mu_{at,0})/\\Omega$, which gives $\\mu = \\gamma\\kappa$ at the interface.\n\n**2.1. Bulk Diffusion**\n\nFor pure bulk diffusion ($M_s=0$), the evolution is $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = M_v \\nabla^2\\mu$. Mass conservation at the sharp interface requires that the normal velocity $v_n$ equals the normal component of the material flux at the interface. The atom flux is given by the Nernst-Einstein relation: $\\mathbf{J}_{at} = -C B \\nabla\\mu_{at}$, where $C=1/\\Omega$ is the atomic concentration in the solid and $B=D_v/(k_B T)$ is the atomic mobility.\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_{at} = -\\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\frac{D_v}{k_B T} \\nabla\\mu_{at}\n$$\nThe phase-field flux $\\mathbf{J}_v$ represents a volume flux, so $\\mathbf{J}_v = \\Omega \\mathbf{J}_{at}$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{J}_{at}$ and using $\\nabla\\mu_{at} = \\Omega \\nabla\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_v = \\Omega \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\Omega} \\frac{D_v}{k_B T} (\\Omega \\nabla\\mu) \\right) = - \\frac{D_v \\Omega}{k_B T} \\nabla\\mu\n$$\nComparing with $\\mathbf{J}_v = -M_v \\nabla\\mu$, we find the calibration for the bulk mobility:\n$$\nM_v = \\frac{D_v \\Omega}{k_B T}\n$$\nThe sharp-interface normal velocity is $v_n = -M_v \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial n}|_S$, where $\\mu$ solves the Laplace equation $\\nabla^2\\mu=0$ in the bulk with the boundary condition $\\mu = \\gamma\\kappa$ at the interface $S$.\n\n**2.2. Surface Diffusion**\n\nFor pure surface diffusion ($M_v=0$), the phase-field evolution equation in the sharp-interface limit leads to a normal velocity given by $v_n = \\nabla_s \\cdot (M_s^{eff} \\nabla_s \\mu)$, where $\\nabla_s$ is the surface gradient operator and $M_s^{eff}$ is the effective surface mobility. The latter is obtained by integrating the tangential mobility from the phase-field model across the interface profile:\n$$\nM_s^{eff} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} M_s w^2 |\\nabla\\phi|^2 dz\n$$\nUsing the equilibrium profile $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\tanh(z/w))$, we have $\\phi' = \\frac{1}{2w}\\mathrm{sech}^2(z/w)$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\nabla\\phi|^2 dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (\\phi')^2 dz = \\frac{1}{4w^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{sech}^4(z/w) dz = \\frac{1}{4w^2} \\left(w \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3w}\n$$\nThus, the effective surface mobility is $M_s^{eff} = M_s w^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3w}\\right) = \\frac{M_s w}{3}$. The phase-field prediction for normal velocity becomes $v_n = \\frac{M_s w}{3} \\nabla_s^2 \\mu = \\frac{M_s w \\gamma}{3} \\nabla_s^2 \\kappa$.\n\nPhysically, surface diffusion is described by the divergence of a surface atom flux, $\\mathbf{j}_s$. The normal velocity is $v_n = -\\Omega \\nabla_s \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_s$. The surface flux is $\\mathbf{j}_s = -n_s B_s \\nabla_s \\mu_{at}$, where the surface density of atoms is $n_s = \\delta_s/\\Omega$ and their mobility is $B_s = D_s/(k_B T)$.\n$$\nv_n = -\\Omega \\nabla_s \\cdot \\left( - \\frac{\\delta_s}{\\Omega} \\frac{D_s}{k_B T} \\nabla_s \\mu_{at} \\right) = \\frac{\\delta_s D_s}{k_B T} \\nabla_s^2 \\mu_{at} = \\frac{D_s \\delta_s \\Omega \\gamma}{k_B T} \\nabla_s^2 \\kappa\n$$\nEquating the physical and phase-field expressions for $v_n$:\n$$\n\\frac{M_s w \\gamma}{3} \\nabla_s^2 \\kappa = \\frac{D_s \\delta_s \\Omega \\gamma}{k_B T} \\nabla_s^2 \\kappa\n$$\nThis yields the calibration for the surface mobility $M_s$:\n$$\nM_s = \\frac{3 D_s \\delta_s \\Omega}{w k_B T}\n$$\n\n**3. Calibrated Mobility Formulas**\n\nThe derived algebraic formulas for the phase-field mobilities, both in SI units of $\\mathrm{m^5/(J \\cdot s)}$, are:\n\nBulk Mobility:\n$$\nM_v = \\frac{D_v \\Omega}{k_B T}\n$$\n\nSurface Mobility:\n$$\nM_s = \\frac{3 D_s \\delta_s \\Omega}{w k_B T}\n$$\n\nwhere $k_\\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.
