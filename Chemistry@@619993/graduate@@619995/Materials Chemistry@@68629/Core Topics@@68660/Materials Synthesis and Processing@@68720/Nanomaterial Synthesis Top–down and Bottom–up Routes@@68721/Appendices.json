Examples include photolithography, electron-beam lithography, and mechanical milling.\n- **Bottom-up methods:** These approaches start with atomic or molecular precursors and assemble them into more complex nanostructures. The final structure is built atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule. Examples include self-assembly, sol-gel synthesis, and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).\n\nIn CVD, volatile molecular precursors are transported in a gas phase to a substrate. On this substrate, they adsorb and undergo chemical reactions to form a solid film or nanostructure. This process is fundamentally an assembly of small building blocks (molecules) into a larger structure. Therefore, CVD is unequivocally a **bottom-up** synthesis route.\n\n### Derivation of the Dimensionless Criterion\nWe must analyze the competition between the rate of mass transport of species $A$ to the substrate surface and the rate of its consumption by the surface reaction. At steady state, these two rates must be equal.\n\nLet $z$ be the coordinate normal to the substrate, with $z=0$ at the surface. The boundary layer extends to $z=\\delta$.\nThe concentration of $A$ at the surface is $C_s = C(z=0)$, and in the far-field (bulk gas) it is $C_b = C(z=\\delta)$.\n\nThe rate of mass transport of $A$ to the surface, expressed as a molar flux ($J_{\\text{transport}}$), is described by Fick's first law. Using the linear concentration profile approximation across the boundary layer of thickness $\\delta$:\n$$J_{\\text{transport}} = -D \\frac{dC}{dz} \\approx -D \\frac{C_b - C_s}{\\delta - 0} = D \\frac{C_b - C_s}{\\delta}$$\nThis transport flux can also be expressed using a mass transfer coefficient, $k_g$, as $J_{\\text{transport}} = k_g (C_b - C_s)$. By comparison, we identify the mass transfer coefficient as:\n$$k_g = \\frac{D}{\\delta}$$\nThe units of $k_g$ are $(L^2/T)/L = L/T$, which are units of velocity, as expected.\n\nThe rate of consumption of $A$ by the surface reaction, expressed as a molar flux ($J_{\\text{reaction}}$), is given as first-order in the surface concentration $C_s$:\n$$J_{\\text{reaction}} = k_s C_s$$\nThe problem states that $k_s$ has units of length per time, which is consistent for this flux expression.\n\nAt steady state, the flux to the surface equals the flux consumed at the surface:\n$$J_{\\text{transport}} = J_{\\text{reaction}}$$\n$$\\frac{D}{\\delta} (C_b - C_s) = k_s C_s$$\n\nWe seek a dimensionless group that compares the characteristic rate of surface reaction to the characteristic rate of mass transport. The characteristic \"velocities\" for these processes are $k_s$ for reaction and $k_g = D/\\delta$ for transport. The ratio of these two quantities provides the desired dimensionless criterion:\n$$\\text{Dimensionless Group} = \\frac{\\text{Characteristic Reaction Rate}}{\\text{Characteristic Transport Rate}} = \\frac{k_s}{k_g} = \\frac{k_s}{D/\\delta} = \\frac{k_s \\delta}{D}$$\nThis specific dimensionless group, comparing a surface reaction rate to a mass transfer rate, is known as the Damköhler number for mass transfer, denoted as $\\mathrm{Da}$.\n$$\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{k_s \\delta}{D}$$\n\nNow, we analyze the limiting regimes based on the value of $\\mathrm{Da}$:\n1.  **Surface Reaction Controlled Regime ($ \\mathrm{Da} \\ll 1 $):**\n    If $\\mathrm{Da} = \\dfrac{k_s \\delta}{D} \\ll 1$, it implies that $k_s \\ll D/\\delta$, meaning the intrinsic reaction rate is much slower than the mass transport rate. Mass transport is efficient at replenishing reactant $A$ at the surface. From the steady-state equation, if $k_s \\delta \\ll D$, then $D C_b \\approx (D + k_s \\delta) C_s \\approx D C_s$, which leads to $C_s \\approx C_b$. The overall deposition rate, $J_{\\text{overall}} = J_{\\text{reaction}} = k_s C_s$, becomes $J_{\\text{overall}} \\approx k_s C_b$. The overall rate is limited by the kinetics of the surface reaction.\n\n2.  **Mass Transport Controlled Regime ($ \\mathrm{Da} \\gg 1 $):**\n    If $\\mathrm{Da} = \\dfrac{k_s \\delta}{D} \\gg 1$, it implies that $k_s \\gg D/\\delta$, meaning the intrinsic reaction rate is much faster than the mass transport rate. The reaction is so fast that it consumes species $A$ as soon as it arrives at the surface. From the steady-state equation, $D(C_b - C_s) = k_s \\delta C_s$. If $k_s \\delta \\gg D$, then $D C_b \\approx k_s \\delta C_s$, which means $C_s = \\dfrac{D}{k_s \\delta} C_b \\rightarrow 0$. The surface concentration is depleted. The overall deposition rate, $J_{\\text{overall}} = J_{\\text{transport}} = \\dfrac{D}{\\delta}(C_b - C_s)$, becomes $J_{\\text{overall}} \\approx \\dfrac{D}{\\delta} C_b = k_g C_b$.

Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) means the sticking probability upon encounter is near unity, so aggregation is controlled by how fast monomers reach the surface by diffusion; Reaction-Limited Aggregation (RLA) means many encounters are needed before attachment, so aggregation is controlled by surface reaction kinetics.

Robin (mixed) boundary condition at the wafer surface: $$-D\\,\\left.\\frac{dc}{dx}\\right|_{x=\\delta(r)} = k_s\\,c\\big(\\delta(r);r\\big).$$\n\nAssume the gas-phase boundary layer thickness varies radially as $$\\delta(r) = H_0 \\left[1 + \\alpha \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right],$$ where $R$ is the wafer radius in $\\mathrm{m}$, $H_0$ is the baseline boundary layer thickness at the wafer center in $\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless curvature parameter describing edge-thickening $(\\alpha>0)$ or edge-thinning $(\\alpha<0)$ of the boundary layer. The local deposition thickness after a process time $t$ in $\\mathrm{s}$ is proportional to the surface molar flux $J(r)$, given by $$h(r) = s_{\\mathrm{dep}}\\,J(r)\\,t,$$ where $s_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ is the thickness-per-molar-flux proportionality in $\\mathrm{m^3/mol}$ (equal to the molar volume of the deposited solid divided by the deposition stoichiometry). The uniformity metric to report is the dimensionless quantity $$U = \\frac{\\max_{r\\in[0,R]} h(r) - \\min_{r\\in[0,R]} h(r)}{\\frac{1}{R}\\int_0^R h(r)\\,dr},$$ which, when discretized over $N$ equally spaced radial points including the center and edge, becomes $$U_N = \\frac{\\max_i h_i - \\min_i h_i}{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N h_i}.$$ Note that $U_N$ is a pure number (no unit). For numerical computation, take $N=51$ and $r_i = \\frac{i-1}{N-1} R$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,N$.\n\nTask:\n- Starting from Fick's law of diffusion and the ideal gas relation for $c_0$, derive the expression for the surface molar flux $J(r)$ resulting from the one-dimensional steady-state diffusion-reaction model with the above boundary conditions. Use this to compute $h(r)$ and then $U_N$.\n- Implement a program that computes $U_N$ for the given test cases.
