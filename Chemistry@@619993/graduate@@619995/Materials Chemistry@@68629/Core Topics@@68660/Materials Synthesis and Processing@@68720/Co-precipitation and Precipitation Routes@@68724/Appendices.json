The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary data (concentrations, volume) and clear constraints (assumptions) to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution for both requested quantities. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires application of fundamental chemical principles (stoichiometry, conservation laws). It is not trivial, as it demands the setup and solution of a system of linear equations derived from physical law. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Determination of Stoichiometric Coefficients\nThe unbalanced net ionic reaction is given as:\n$$a \\text{Fe}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + b \\text{Fe}^{3+}(\\text{aq}) + c \\text{OH}^{-}(\\text{aq}) \\rightarrow d \\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}(\\text{s}) + e \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}(\\text{l})$$\nTo find the minimal integer coefficients, we set the coefficient of the most complex product, $\\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}$, to $d=1$.\n$$a \\text{Fe}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + b \\text{Fe}^{3+}(\\text{aq}) + c \\text{OH}^{-}(\\text{aq}) \\rightarrow 1 \\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}(\\text{s}) + e \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}(\\text{l})$$\nWe now apply the principles of conservation of atoms and charge to establish a system of linear equations for the unknown coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $e$.\n\n1.  Conservation of Iron (Fe) atoms:\n    The total number of iron atoms on the reactant side must equal the number on the product side.\n    $$a + b = 3 \\times 1 \\implies a + b = 3$$\n2.  Conservation of Oxygen (O) atoms:\n    $$c \\times 1 = (4 \\times 1) + (e \\times 1) \\implies c = 4 + e$$\n3.  Conservation of Hydrogen (H) atoms:\n    $$c \\times 1 = e \\times 2 \\implies c = 2e$$\n4.  Conservation of Charge:\n    The net charge on the reactant side must equal the net charge on the product side. The products, $\\text{Fe}_{3}\\text{O}_{4}(\\text{s})$ and $\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}(\\text{l})$, are neutral.\n    $$a(+2) + b(+3) + c(-1) = 0 \\implies 2a + 3b - c = 0$$\n\nWe now have a system of four equations:\n(i) $a + b = 3$\n(ii) $c = 4 + e$\n(iii) $c = 2e$\n(iv) $2a + 3b - c = 0$\n\nWe solve this system. By equating (ii) and (iii):\n$$2e = 4 + e \\implies e = 4$$\nSubstitute $e=4$ into (iii) to find $c$:\n$$c = 2(4) = 8$$\nSubstitute $c=8$ into (iv):\n$$2a + 3b - 8 = 0 \\implies 2a + 3b = 8$$\nWe are left with a system of two equations for $a$ and $b$:\n(i) $a + b = 3$\n(v) $2a + 3b = 8$\n\nFrom (i), we express $a$ as $a = 3 - b$.

Therefore, both $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$ will be fully consumed without one being in excess relative to the other.\n\nWe can now calculate the moles of hydroxide ions ($\\text{OH}^{-}$) needed for the complete precipitation. Using the moles of $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$ as the basis for calculation:\n$$n_{\\text{OH}^{-}} = n_{\\text{Fe}^{2+}} \\times \\left( \\frac{8 \\text{ mol } \\text{OH}^{-}}{1 \\text{ mol } \\text{Fe}^{2+}} \\right) = 0.010 \\text{ mol} \\times 8 = 0.080 \\text{ mol}$$\nTo verify, we can use the moles of $\\text{Fe}^{3+}$:\n$$n_{\\text{OH}^{-}} = n_{\\text{Fe}^{3+}} \\times \\left( \\frac{8 \\text{ mol } \\text{OH}^{-}}{2 \\text{ mol } \\text{Fe}^{3+}} \\right) = 0.020 \\text{ mol} \\times 4 = 0.080 \\text{ mol}$$\nThe calculation is consistent. $0.080$ moles of $\\text{OH}^{-}$ are required.\n\nThe problem asks for the moles of sodium hydroxide, $\\text{NaOH}$. Since $\\text{NaOH}$ is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates completely according to $\\text{NaOH} \\rightarrow \\text{Na}^{+} + \\text{OH}^{-}$. This provides a $1:1$ molar ratio between $\\text{NaOH}$ and $\\text{OH}^{-}$.\nTherefore, the moles of $\\text{NaOH}$ required is equal to the moles of $\\text{OH}^{-}$ required.\n$$n_{\\text{NaOH}} = n_{\\text{OH}^{-}} = 0.080 \\text{ mol}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.080}$$", "id": "2473550"}, {"introduction": "Beyond stoichiometry, the art of precipitation lies in controlling the thermodynamics of the system.
