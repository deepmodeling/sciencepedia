It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. The work required to charge a conductor is the integral of the potential with respect to the incremental charge. The self-energy, $W$, of a spherical conductor of radius $r$ carrying a final charge $q$ is found by calculating the work done to build this charge from $0$ to $q$. At an intermediate charge $q'$, the electrostatic potential at the surface of the sphere is given by Coulomb's law.\n\nIn a vacuum, where the relative permittivity is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{vac}} = 1$, the absolute permittivity is $\\varepsilon_0$. The potential $V_{\\mathrm{vac}}(q')$ at the surface of the sphere of radius $r$ is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{vac}}(q') = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}$$\nThe self-energy in vacuum, $W_{\\mathrm{vac}}$, is the work done to charge the sphere from $0$ to $q$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\int_0^q V_{\\mathrm{vac}}(q') \\, dq' = \\int_0^q \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\, dq' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\int_0^q q' \\, dq' = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r}$$\nNext, we consider the same process but with the spherical cavity embedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium of relative permittivity $\\varepsilon$. The absolute permittivity of this medium is $\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon$. The potential $V_{\\mathrm{med}}(q')$ at the surface of the cavity is now:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{med}}(q') = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon r}$$\nThe corresponding self-energy in the medium, $W_{\\mathrm{med}}$, is:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{med}} = \\int_0^q V_{\\mathrm{med}}(q') \\, dq' = \\int_0^q \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon r} \\, dq' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon r} \\int_0^q q' \\, dq' = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon r}$$\nThe Born solvation free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$, is defined as the change in free energy when transferring the ion from vacuum to the dielectric medium. This corresponds to the difference between the final and initial self-energies:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = W_{\\mathrm{med}} - W_{\\mathrm{vac}}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $W_{\\mathrm{med}}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{vac}}$ yields the analytical expression for the Born energy:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon r} - \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - 1\\right)$$\nThis is the required analytical expression. Since for any medium other than vacuum $\\varepsilon > 1$, the term $(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - 1)$ is negative, indicating that solvation is a spontaneous, energetically favorable process ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}  0$).\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically for a single monovalent cation, $q = +e$, with the given parameters and constants, ensuring all are in SI units.\n$q = e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$r = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\varepsilon = 78.4$ (dimensionless)\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n\nThe single-particle energy $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$ is:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} = \\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}{8\\pi (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}})(2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m})} \\left(\\frac{1}{78.4} - 1\\right)$$\nCalculating the components:\n$$\\frac{(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{8\\pi (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12})(2.0 \\times 10^{-10})} \\approx \\frac{2.56697 \\times 10^{-38}}{4.45037 \\times 10^{-21}}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\approx 5.7679 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{78.4} - 1\\right) \\approx 0.012755 - 1 = -0.987245$$\nThus, for a single ion:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}} \\approx (5.7679 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times (-0.987245) \\approx -5.6943 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nTo convert this to a molar quantity, we multiply by the Avogadro constant $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born, molar}} = (-5.6943 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) \\approx -342876\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nConverting to kilojoules per mole by dividing by $1000$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born, molar}} \\approx -342.876\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required gives $-342.9\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, we address the sensitivity of $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$ to the choice of the cavity radius $r$. The sensitivity can be quantified by the first derivative of $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}$ with respect to $r$. Let $C$ be the constant term:\n$$C = \\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - 1\\right)$$\nThen, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}(r) = \\frac{C}{r}$. The derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}})}{dr} = -\\frac{C}{r^2} = -\\frac{1}{r} \\left(\\frac{C}{r}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born}}}{r}$$\nThis simple inverse relationship shows that the local sensitivity is directly proportional to the magnitude of the solvation energy itself and inversely proportional to the radius. At $r = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, we can evaluate this sensitivity using the molar energy:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{Born, molar}})}{dr} \\bigg|_{r=2.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}} = -\\frac{-342.9\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}}{2.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}} = 171.45\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}}$$\nThis result indicates an extreme sensitivity. A minor uncertainty or variation in the cavity radius of only $0.1\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ (a $5\\%$ change relative to $r=2.0\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) would result in a change in the calculated solvation free energy of approximately $17.1\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. This is a chemically significant energy, comparable to the strength of a hydrogen bond. Therefore, the Born model is highly sensitive to the choice of $r$, which is its primary, and problematic, empirical parameter, as it is not a well-defined physical observable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-342.9}$$", "id": "2890924"}, {"introduction": "A central goal in computational chemistry is to accurately predict the thermodynamics of reactions in solution, where most chemical processes occur.

It is based on the fundamental principle that the Gibbs free energy is a state function. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical values and clear definitions for the quantities to be computed. All provided data are dimensionally consistent and physically plausible. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires substantive reasoning. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe core principle is that the change in a state function, such as the Gibbs free energy $G$, for a process is independent of the path taken. The problem defines two independent theoretical paths for the same overall process: the tautomerization of species $A$ to species $B$ in solution, i.e., $A(\\text{solv}) \\to B(\\text{solv})$. The discrepancy between the free energy changes calculated via these two paths is the cycle closure error, which measures the inconsistency between the theoretical models employed.\n\nFirst, we compute the total free energy change for the hybrid explicit-solvent route, denoted here as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{exp\\,path}}$. This path is composed of the MM alchemical transformation and its various corrections. Based on the problem description, this is the sum of the first four given terms:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{exp\\,path}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{\\mathrm{exp}} + \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{QM{-}MM}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{LR}} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{rest}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{exp\\,path}} = (+9.9) + (+1.0) + (+0.3) + (+0.2) = 11.4\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the total free energy change for the cluster-continuum route, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cc\\,path}}$. This path is constructed from the gas-phase reaction energy and the differential solvation free energy of the tautomers, as explicitly defined in the problem statement. The differential solvation free energy is $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}^{\\mathrm{cc}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}^{\\mathrm{cc}}(B) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}^{\\mathrm{cc}}(A)$.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cc\\,path}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\mathrm{QM}} + \\left( \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}^{\\mathrm{cc}}(B) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}^{\\mathrm{cc}}(A) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cc\\,path}} = (+8.7) + \\left( (-18.5) - (-21.3) \\right) = 8.7 + 2.8 = 11.5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\n\nThe cycle closure error, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{error}}$, is the difference between the free energy changes computed for the same overall transformation via these two distinct routes.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{error}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{exp\\,path}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{cc\\,path}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{error}} = 11.4 - 11.5 = -0.1\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. Expressing $-0.1$ to three significant figures yields $-0.100$.\n\nThe existence of a non-zero closure error, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{error}} \\neq 0$, points to methodological imbalances between the two pathways. The principal categories of such imbalance are:\n\n1.  **Inconsistency in Quantum Mechanical Level of Theory**: The QM method used for the gas-phase energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\mathrm{QM}}$, and within the QM/MM correction, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{QM{-}MM}}$, may differ in basis set or level of theory (e.g., DFT functional, post-Hartree-Fock method). A balanced calculation requires a consistent QM description of the reactive core across all legs of the cycle.\n\n2.  **Imbalance in Solvation Treatment**: This is the most significant source of error. The explicit-solvent path models the entire solvent environment atomistically, capturing specific hydrogen bonds and local packing effects, treated with long-range corrections like Particle Mesh Ewald (PME). The cluster-continuum path simplifies this by treating only a small number of solvent molecules explicitly (the \"cluster\") and representing the rest of the bulk solvent as a dielectric continuum (the \"continuum,\" e.g., PCM). This fundamental difference in representation leads to discrepancies. The cluster may be too small to capture all relevant short-range interactions, and the continuum model is an approximation for long-range electrostatics and non-polar solvation effects.\n\n3.  **Phase-Space Sampling Mismatch**: The QM/MM correction, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{QM{-}MM}}$, is typically calculated by reweighting or averaging over configurations generated from an MM simulation. If the potential energy surface of the MM force field is substantially different from the QM/MM surface, the sampled configurations may be a poor representation of the true QM/MM ensemble, leading to a poorly converged and inaccurate correction.\n\n4.  **Force Field Inadequacy**: The classical force field used for the MM simulation may not accurately reproduce the solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions compared to the reality captured by the QM description in the other path. This includes inaccuracies in electrostatic parameters (partial charges, polarizability) and van der Waals parameters.\n\n5.  **Inconsistent Geometries**: The equilibrium geometries of the solute and cluster in the gas phase and cluster-continuum calculations may differ from the average structures populated in the explicit solvent simulation, creating a structural mismatch between the two legs of the cycle.\n\nA non-zero closure error is not merely a numerical failure but a quantitative diagnostic tool for evaluating the degree of consistency between different multiscale modeling strategies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.100}\n$$", "id": "2890848"}]}
