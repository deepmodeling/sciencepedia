This exercise is fundamental for building intuition about how crystalline structure dictates electronic properties.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional Bravais lattice with $N$ identical sites arranged on a ring of total length $L = N a$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. Electrons are described within a single-orbital nearest-neighbor tight-binding model with on-site energy $\\epsilon_{0}$ and hopping integral $t$ between nearest neighbors. Assume that the system is invariant under lattice translations and that the electronic Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Electrons are spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ fermions, and both spin projections are degenerate and noninteracting. The system obeys Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), meaning that all observables are invariant under translation by $L$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of translational symmetry, the tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, and Blochâ€™s theorem, do the following:\n\n1. Construct the Bloch eigenstates and obtain the band dispersion relation $E(k)$ for the single band that arises from the single orbital per site. Your derivation must start from the lattice Hamiltonian in real space and the translation operator, and it must not assume any specific form of $E(k)$ a priori.\n\n2.

Your final answer must be a single analytic expression. Do not include units in the final expression.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional chain of $N$ identical sites with lattice constant $a$. The basis states are the localized atomic orbitals $|n\\rangle$ for each site $n \\in \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$, which are assumed to be orthonormal: $\\langle m | n \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ for a single-orbital nearest-neighbor tight-binding model is constructed from two components: the on-site energy $\\epsilon_0$ for an electron at any site, and the hopping integral $t$, which quantifies the interaction between electrons on adjacent sites. By convention, the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbors is taken as $-t$, where $t$ is a positive real number. The Hamiltonian is required to be Hermitian. With periodic boundary conditions (PBC), site $N+1$ is identified with site $1$. The Hamiltonian in the site basis is:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\epsilon_{0} |n\\rangle\\langle n| - t \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( |n\\rangle\\langle n+1| + |n+1\\rangle\\langle n| \\right)\n$$\nwhere the condition $|N+1\\rangle \\equiv |1\\rangle$ is imposed.\n\nThe system is invariant under lattice translations. The translation operator $\\hat{T}$ shifts the lattice by one site, such that $\\hat{T}|n\\rangle = |n+1\\rangle$. For this symmetry to hold, the Hamiltonian must commute with the translation operator: $[\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}] = 0$. Let us verify this:\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\hat{T}|n\\rangle = \\hat{H}|n+1\\rangle = \\epsilon_0 |n+1\\rangle - t(|n\\rangle + |n+2\\rangle)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{T}\\hat{H}|n\\rangle = \\hat{T}\\left( \\epsilon_0 |n\\rangle - t(|n-1\\rangle + |n+1\\rangle) \\right) = \\epsilon_0 |n+1\\rangle - t(|n\\rangle + |n+2\\rangle)\n$$\nSince $\\hat{H}\\hat{T}|n\\rangle = \\hat{T}\\hat{H}|n\\rangle$ for all basis states $|n\\rangle$, the operators commute. This guarantees the existence of a common set of eigenstates for $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{T}$.\n\n**1. Bloch Eigenstates and Dispersion Relation $E(k)$**\n\nAccording to Bloch's theorem, the eigenstates of a periodic system can be written as Bloch states. An eigenstate $|\\psi_k\\rangle$ of the translation operator $\\hat{T}$ satisfies $\\hat{T}|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\lambda_k |\\psi_k\\rangle$. Since $\\hat{T}$ is unitary, its eigenvalues must be complex numbers of unit modulus, which we write as $\\lambda_k = \\exp(ika)$, where $k$ is the crystal momentum.\n\nWe construct the Bloch state $|\\psi_k\\rangle$ as a linear combination of the site orbitals: $|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n(k) |n\\rangle$. Applying the eigenvalue equation for $\\hat{T}$:\n$$\n\\hat{T} |\\psi_k\\rangle = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n(k) |n+1\\rangle = \\exp(ika) \\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n(k) |n\\rangle\n$$\nBy re-indexing the sum on the left side ($m=n+1$), we get $\\sum_{m=1}^{N} c_{m-1}(k) |m\\rangle$. Comparing coefficients of $|n\\rangle$ yields the recurrence relation $c_{n-1}(k) = \\exp(ika) c_n(k)$, or $c_n(k) = \\exp(ikna) c_0(k)$. The coefficients are thus determined up to a normalization constant. The Bloch eigenstate is:\n$$\n|\\psi_k\\rangle = C \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) |n\\rangle\n$$\nThe normalization condition $\\langle \\psi_k | \\psi_k \\rangle = 1$ determines the constant $C$.\n$$\n\\langle \\psi_k | \\psi_k \\rangle = |C|^2 \\sum_{n,m=1}^{N} \\exp(-ikma) \\exp(ikna) \\langle m|n \\rangle = |C|^2 \\sum_{n,m=1}^{N} \\exp(ik(n-m)a) \\delta_{mn} = |C|^2 \\sum_{n=1}^{N} 1 = |C|^2 N\n$$\nThus, we choose $C = 1/\\sqrt{N}$. The normalized Bloch eigenstate is:\n$$\n|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) |n\\rangle\n$$\nNow we find the energy eigenvalue $E(k)$ by applying the Hamiltonian to this state:\n$$\n\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) \\hat{H}|n\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) \\left( \\epsilon_0 |n\\rangle - t|n-1\\rangle - t|n+1\\rangle \\right)\n$$\nWe analyze each term separately:\n$$\n\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) |n\\rangle = \\epsilon_0 |\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) |n-1\\rangle = -t \\exp(ika) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ik(n-1)a) |n-1\\rangle \\right) = -t \\exp(ika) |\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ikna) |n+1\\rangle = -t \\exp(-ika) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(ik(n+1)a) |n+1\\rangle \\right) = -t \\exp(-ika) |\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\nCombining these terms gives the eigenvalue equation:\n$$\n\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\left( \\epsilon_0 - t(\\exp(ika) + \\exp(-ika)) \\right) |\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity $\\cos(x) = (\\exp(ix) + \\exp(-ix))/2$, we obtain the band dispersion relation:\n$$\nE(k) = \\epsilon_0 - 2t \\cos(ka)\n$$\n\n**2. Quantization of Crystal Momentum $k$**\n\nThe periodic boundary conditions (PBC) require that a translation by the total length of the ring, $L=Na$, is equivalent to the identity operation. The operator for translation by $N$ sites is $\\hat{T}^N$. Its action on a Bloch state is:\n$$\n\\hat{T}^N |\\psi_k\\rangle = (\\lambda_k)^N |\\psi_k\\rangle = (\\exp(ika))^N |\\psi_k\\rangle = \\exp(ikNa) |\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\hat{T}^N$ must be the identity operator $\\hat{I}$, its eigenvalue must be $1$.\n$$\n\\exp(ikNa) = 1\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied if $kNa = 2\\pi j$ for any integer $j$. This leads to the quantization of the crystal momentum $k$:\n$$\nk = j \\frac{2\\pi}{Na}, \\quad j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThe energy dispersion $E(k)$ is periodic with a period of $2\\pi/a$. Therefore, we only need to consider a range of $k$ of length $2\\pi/a$, which defines the first Brillouin Zone (BZ), for example, $k \\in (-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$. The number of distinct $k$ values within the BZ must be equal to the number of sites, $N$. The allowed values of $j$ are chosen to yield $N$ consecutive, distinct values of $k$ in the BZ. A conventional choice for $j$ is $j \\in \\{-\\frac{N}{2}+1, \\dots, \\frac{N}{2}\\}$ for even $N$, giving $N$ unique allowed $k$ vectors.\n\n**3. Ground-State Energy per Site at Half-Filling**\n\nAt half-filling, the total number of electrons is $N_{el} = N$. Since electrons are spin-$1/2$ fermions and spin states are degenerate, each $k$-state can accommodate two electrons (one spin-up, one spin-down). To find the ground state at zero temperature, we fill the electronic states in order of increasing energy, starting from the minimum, until all $N$ electrons are placed. This requires filling the $N/2$ lowest-energy $k$-states.\n\nAssuming $t > 0$, the dispersion $E(k) = \\epsilon_0 - 2t\\cos(ka)$ has its minimum at $k=0$ ($E_{min} = \\epsilon_0 - 2t$) and its maximum at $k=\\pm\\pi/a$ ($E_{max} = \\epsilon_0 + 2t$). The states are filled symmetrically around $k=0$ up to a Fermi wavevector $k_F$. The number of states within the interval $[-k_F, k_F]$ must be $N/2$.\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit ($N \\to \\infty, L \\to \\infty$ with $L/N=a$ fixed), the discrete $k$-points become dense. The summation over $k$ can be replaced by an integral. The density of states in $k$-space is $D(k) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta k} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi/L} = \\frac{L}{2\\pi}$. The number of states is found by integrating this density:\n$$\n\\int_{-k_F}^{k_F} \\frac{L}{2\\pi} dk = \\frac{L}{\\pi} k_F = \\frac{Na}{\\pi} k_F\n$$\nSetting this equal to the number of occupied orbitals, $N/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{Na}{\\pi} k_F = \\frac{N}{2} \\implies k_F = \\frac{\\pi}{2a}\n$$\nThe total ground-state energy $E_{\\text{gs}}$ is the sum of the energies of all occupied states, including the spin degeneracy factor of $2$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{gs}} = 2 \\sum_{|k| \\le k_F} E(k)\n$$\nIn the thermodynamic limit, this sum becomes an integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{gs}} = 2 \\int_{-k_F}^{k_F} E(k) \\frac{L}{2\\pi} dk = \\frac{L}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi/(2a)}^{\\pi/(2a)} (\\epsilon_0 - 2t \\cos(ka)) dk\n$$\nSubstituting $L=Na$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{gs}} = \\frac{Na}{\\pi} \\left[ \\epsilon_0 k - \\frac{2t}{a} \\sin(ka) \\right]_{-\\pi/(2a)}^{\\pi/(2a)}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$\nE_{\\text{gs}} = \\frac{Na}{\\pi} \\left( \\left(\\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\pi}{2a} - \\frac{2t}{a}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\left(\\epsilon_0 \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2a}\\right) - \\frac{2t}{a}\\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{gs}} = \\frac{Na}{\\pi} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\pi}{2a} - \\frac{2t}{a}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\pi}{2a} + \\frac{2t}{a}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{Na}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\pi}{a} - \\frac{4t}{a} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{gs}} = N\\epsilon_0 - \\frac{4Nt}{\\pi}\n$$\nThe ground-state energy per site, $E_{\\text{gs}}/N$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\text{gs}}}{N} = \\epsilon_0 - \\frac{4t}{\\pi}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\epsilon_{0} - \\frac{4t}{\\pi}}\n$$", "id": "2914632"}, {"introduction": "Building directly on the concept of band dispersion, this problem explores the physical meaning of the $E(k)$ curve by examining an electron's velocity.

The position operator $\\hat{x}$ acts on the basis states as $\\hat{x}|n\\rangle = R_{n}|n\\rangle$, where $R_{n} = na$.

Identify the corresponding effective masses $m_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $m_{+}^{\\ast}$ at the band extrema at $k=k_{0}$ via the definition $E_{\\pm}(q) \\approx E_{\\pm}(0) + \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{\\pm}^{\\ast}} q^{2}$, where the subscript $-$ denotes the lower band and $+$ the upper band split by the gap at $k_{0}$. Express your final answer as closed-form analytic expressions for $m_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $m_{+}^{\\ast}$ in terms of $m$, $\\hbar$, $G$, and $|V_{G}|$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units should be included in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective masses for the lower and upper energy bands at the edge of the first Brillouin zone in a one-dimensional crystal, within the nearly-free-electron approximation.\n\nWe begin with the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation for an electron of mass $m$ in a periodic potential $V(x)$:\n$$ H\\psi(x) = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + V(x)\\right)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x) $$\nThe potential $V(x)$ is periodic with period $a$, so $V(x+a)=V(x)$. According to Bloch's theorem, the wavefunction $\\psi_k(x)$ for a given wavevector $k$ can be expressed as a plane wave modulated by a periodic function, $\\psi_{k}(x) = \\exp(ikx)u_{k}(x)$, where $u_k(x+a) = u_k(x)$. This allows for an expansion of the wavefunction into a Fourier series of plane waves:\n$$ \\psi_k(x) = \\sum_{K} C_{k-K} \\exp(i(k-K)x) $$\nwhere $K$ are the reciprocal lattice vectors, given by $K = nG$ for integers $n$, with $G = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. The potential is also expanded as a Fourier series, $V(x) = \\sum_K V_K \\exp(iKx)$. The problem states that the potential is dominated by its first harmonic, $V(x) \\approx 2V_{G}\\cos(Gx)$. For a real potential, its Fourier coefficients must satisfy $V_{-K} = V_{K}^{\\ast}$. We can write $2V_G\\cos(Gx)$ as $V_G(\\exp(iGx)+\\exp(-iGx))$ which implies $V_{-G}=V_G$. For this to be real, $V_G$ must be real. A more general form $V(x) = V_G \\exp(iGx) + V_G^* \\exp(-iGx)$ can be reduced to $V(x) = 2|V_G|\\cos(Gx)$ by a shift of the spatial origin, which does not alter the energy spectrum. We thus set $V_G=V_{-G}=|V_G|$ and all other $V_K=0$ for $K \\neq \\pm G$.\n\nSubstituting the Fourier expansions for $\\psi_k(x)$ and $V(x)$ into the SchrÃ¶dinger equation leads to a set of coupled equations for the coefficients $C_{k-K}$:\n$$ \\left( E_{k-K}^0 - E \\right) C_{k-K} + \\sum_{K'} V_{K'} C_{k-K+K'} = 0 $$\nwhere $E_{q}^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m}$ is the free-electron energy.\n\nWe are interested in the solution near the first Brillouin zone boundary, $k \\approx k_0 = G/2$. At this point, the free-electron states for wavevectors $k=G/2$ and $k-G = -G/2$ are degenerate, with energy $E^0_{G/2} = E^0_{-G/2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2(G/2)^2}{2m}$. The potential component $V_G$ strongly couples these two states. We therefore employ a two-plane-wave approximation, truncating the expansion to include only the coefficients $C_k$ and $C_{k-G}$. The infinite system of equations reduces to a $2 \\times 2$ system:\n$$ \\left( E_k^0 - E \\right) C_k + V_{-G} C_{k-G} = 0 $$\n$$ V_G C_k + \\left( E_{k-G}^0 - E \\right) C_{k-G} = 0 $$\nUsing the fact that for a real potential $V_G V_{-G} = |V_G|^2$, this system can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} E_k^0 - E & V_{-G} \\\\ V_G & E_{k-G}^0 - E \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} C_k \\\\ C_{k-G} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nA non-trivial solution exists only if the determinant of the matrix is zero:\n$$ (E_k^0 - E)(E_{k-G}^0 - E) - |V_G|^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the energy eigenvalues $E$. The solution is:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(k) = \\frac{E_k^0 + E_{k-G}^0}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E_k^0 - E_{k-G}^0}{2}\\right)^2 + |V_G|^2} $$\nThe problem asks for the dispersion near $k = k_0 + q = G/2 + q$, where $|q| \\ll G$. We express the free-electron energies in terms of $q$:\n$$ E_k^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G}{2}+q\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} + Gq + q^2\\right) $$\n$$ E_{k-G}^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G}{2}+q-G\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(-\\frac{G}{2}+q\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} - Gq + q^2\\right) $$\nThe sum and difference are:\n$$ E_k^0 + E_{k-G}^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} + q^2\\right) $$\n$$ E_k^0 - E_{k-G}^0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 Gq}{m} $$\nSubstituting these into the energy eigenvalue equation:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(q) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{G^2}{4} + q^2\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 Gq}{2m}\\right)^2 + |V_G|^2} $$\n$$ E_{\\pm}(q) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{8m} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2 q^2}{4m^2} + |V_G|^2} $$\nTo find the dispersion to second order in $q$, we perform a Taylor expansion of the square-root term for small $q$. We factor out $|V_G|$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2 q^2}{4m^2} + |V_G|^2} = |V_G|\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2 q^2}{4m^2|V_G|^2}} $$\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1 + \\frac{x}{2}$ for small $x$:\n$$ |V_G|\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2 q^2}{4m^2|V_G|^2}\\right) = |V_G| + \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2 q^2}{8m^2|V_G|} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $E_{\\pm}(q)$:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(q) \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{8m} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} \\pm \\left(|V_G| + \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2 q^2}{8m^2|V_G|}\\right) $$\nThe energy bands near $q=0$ are:\n$$ E_{+}(q) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{8m} + |V_G|\\right) + q^2\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} + \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2}{8m^2|V_G|}\\right) $$\n$$ E_{-}(q) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{8m} - |V_G|\\right) + q^2\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} - \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2}{8m^2|V_G|}\\right) $$\nThe energy at the band extrema ($q=0$) is $E_{\\pm}(0) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{8m} \\pm |V_G|$. The gap at the zone boundary is $E_g = E_+(0) - E_-(0) = 2|V_G|$.\nThe effective mass $m^*$ is defined by the quadratic approximation of the dispersion relation around an extremum: $E(q) \\approx E(0) + \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m^*}$. By comparing the coefficients of the $q^2$ terms, we find the effective masses $m_{+}^*$ for the upper band and $m_{-}^*$ for the lower band.\n\nFor the upper band ($+$):\n$$ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_{+}^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} + \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2}{8m^2|V_G|} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{m_{+}^{\\ast}} = \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m^2|V_G|} = \\frac{1}{m}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m|V_G|}\\right) $$\n$$ m_{+}^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{1 + \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m|V_G|}} $$\nFor the lower band ($-$):\n$$ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_{-}^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} - \\frac{\\hbar^4 G^2}{8m^2|V_G|} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{m_{-}^{\\ast}} = \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m^2|V_G|} = \\frac{1}{m}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m|V_G|}\\right) $$\n$$ m_{-}^{\\ast} = \\frac{m}{1 - \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m|V_G|}} $$\nThe lower band has its maximum at $k=G/2$, so its curvature is negative, and thus $m_{-}^{\\ast}$ is negative, which is consistent with the derived expression since in the nearly-free electron model $|V_G| \\ll E^0_{G/2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{8m}$, implying $\\frac{\\hbar^2 G^2}{4m|V_G|} > 2$, making the denominator negative.\nThe upper band has its minimum at $k=G/2$, so its curvature is positive, and $m_{+}^{\\ast}$ is positive.\nThe final expressions for the effective masses are therefore established. In the original solution, a minor error in reasoning was corrected: the derivation for the secular determinant requires $V_G V_{-G}$, which for a real potential becomes $|V_G|^2$. The initial text reasoning about setting $V_G=|V_G|$ was slightly imprecise and has been clarified.
