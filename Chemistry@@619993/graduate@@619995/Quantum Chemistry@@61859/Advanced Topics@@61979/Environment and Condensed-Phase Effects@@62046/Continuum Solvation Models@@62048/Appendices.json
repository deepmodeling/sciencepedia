It requires the derivation of a fundamental result in continuum electrostatics—the Born model of ion solvation—and its application to a sensitivity analysis. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary physical constants, parameters, and definitions. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles as demanded.\n\nThe system consists of a point charge $q$ at the origin, within a spherical cavity of radius $r$. The space is partitioned into two regions: an inner region ($R < r$) which is vacuum with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r,in} = 1$, and an outer region ($R > r$) which is a dielectric continuum with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r$. The electrostatic potential $\\phi$ is governed by the Poisson equation, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\nabla \\phi) = -\\rho_{free}$.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the problem, the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ is a function only of the radial distance $R$ from the origin.\n\nInside the cavity ($0 < R < r$), the charge density is zero except at the origin where the point charge resides. The potential $\\phi_{in}(R)$ is the superposition of the potential from the point charge itself and the reaction potential $\\phi_{reac}$ from the polarized dielectric medium. The reaction potential must be a solution to the Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi_{reac} = 0$, that is regular at the origin ($R=0$). In spherical coordinates, the only such solution with spherical symmetry is a constant, $C$. Thus, the total potential inside the cavity is:\n$$\n\\phi_{in}(R) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 R} + C\n$$\nThis form correctly captures the singularity at $R=0$ due to the point charge.\n\nOutside the cavity ($R > r$), the region is charge-free, so the potential $\\phi_{out}(R)$ must satisfy the Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi_{out}(R) = 0$. The solution that vanishes as $R \\to \\infty$ is:\n$$\n\\phi_{out}(R) = \\frac{A}{R}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant to be determined.\n\nThe constants $A$ and $C$ are found by applying the standard boundary conditions of electrostatics at the dielectric interface, $R=r$.\n\n$1$.

The dimensionless finite-difference elasticity, $E$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\Delta G(r_{\\mathrm{UFF}}) - \\Delta G(r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}})}{\\Delta G(r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}})} \\Bigg/ \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{UFF}} - r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}}}{r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that if the denominator in either ratio is zero (i.e., if $r_{\\mathrm{UFF}} = r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}}$ or $\\Delta G(r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}}) = 0$), $E$ must be set to $0.0$. The condition $\\Delta G(r_{\\mathrm{Bondi}}) = 0$ occurs if $q=0$ or $\\varepsilon_r=1$.\n\nThe program will implement the derived formula for $\\Delta G$, perform the necessary unit conversions, and compute these two metrics for each of the specified test cases. Final numerical results will be rounded to six decimal places as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the sensitivity of solvation free energy to atomic radius changes\n    based on the Born model of ion solvation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Physical constants\n    ANGSTROM_TO_M = 1e-10  # m/Å\n    E_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # C\n    N_AVOGADRO = 6.02214076e23  # mol^-1\n    EPSILON_0 = 8.8541878128e-12  # F/m\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # name, q (in e), eps_r, r_bondi (Å), r_uff (Å)\n        ('Na+', 1, 78.3553, 2.27, 2.35),\n        ('Cl-', -1, 78.3553, 1.75, 1.948),\n        ('Mg2+', 2, 78.3553, 1.73, 1.50),\n        ('F-', -1, 78.3553, 1.47, 1.571),\n        ('X+', 1, 78.3553, 1.50, 1.50),\n        ('V+', 1, 1.0, 2.00, 2.20),\n    ]\n\n    def compute_solvation_energy(q_val, r_val_angstrom, eps_r):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the molar solvation free energy in kJ/mol using the Born equation.\n        \n        Args:\n            q_val (float): Charge of the ion in units of elementary charge e.\n            r_val_angstrom (float): Radius of the cavity in Ångströms.\n            eps_r (float): Relative permittivity of the solvent.\n            \n        Returns:\n            float: Molar solvation free energy in kJ/mol.\n        \"\"\"\n        if eps_r <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Relative permittivity must be positive.\")\n        if r_val_angstrom <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Radius must be positive.\")\n\n        # Handle the case of vacuum, where solvation energy is zero.\n        if eps_r == 1.0:\n            return 0.0\n\n        # Convert to SI units\n        q = q_val * E_CHARGE  # Charge in Coulombs\n        r = r_val_angstrom * ANGSTROM_TO_M  # Radius in meters\n\n        # Born equation for single ion energy (in Joules)\n        # delta_G = - (q^2 / (8 * pi * eps_0 * r)) * (1 - 1/eps_r)\n        \n        # Pre-calculate constant factor to avoid repeating computations\n        prefactor = - (q**2) / (8 * np.pi * EPSILON_0)  # J*m\n        dielectric_factor = 1.0 - (1.0 / eps_r)\n        \n        delta_g_ion = prefactor * dielectric_factor / r  # J\n\n        # Convert to molar energy in kJ/mol\n        delta_g_molar_kj = delta_g_ion * N_AVOGADRO / 1000.0\n        \n        return delta_g_molar_kj\n\n    results = []\n    for _, q_val, eps_r, r_bondi, r_uff in test_cases:\n        \n        # Compute solvation free energies for both radii\n        delta_g_bondi = compute_solvation_energy(q_val, r_bondi, eps_r)\n        delta_g_uff = compute_solvation_energy(q_val, r_uff, eps_r)\n        \n        # 1.
