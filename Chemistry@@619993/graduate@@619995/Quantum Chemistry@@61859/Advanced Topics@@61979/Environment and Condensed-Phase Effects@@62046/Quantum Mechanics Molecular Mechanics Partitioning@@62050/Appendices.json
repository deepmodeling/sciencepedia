Consider a two-layer scheme within the framework of Our own N-layered Integrated molecular Orbital and molecular Mechanics (ONIOM), in which both layers are treated by quantum mechanics: a high-level quantum mechanical method for a small “model” subsystem embedded within a larger “real” system, and a low-level quantum mechanical method for the entire “real” system. The goal is to approximate the unknown high-level electronic energy of the full “real” system by combining a small number of computable quantities.\n\nStarting from first principles of energy additivity under the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and the assumption that the difference between high- and low-level methods is localized primarily to the model subsystem, derive a closed-form expression for the ONIOM two-layer total energy of the “real” system in terms of three computable energies: the low-level energy of the “real” system, and the high- and low-level energies of the “model” system.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum chemistry, specifically the ONIOM (Our own N-layered Integrated molecular Orbital and molecular Mechanics) multilayer method. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested expression and compute the final numerical answer.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expression for the total energy of a \"real\" system, $E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}$, within a two-layer QM/QM ONIOM framework. This energy is an approximation to the computationally prohibitive energy of the entire real system calculated at a high level of theory, which we denote as $E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{real}}$. The derivation proceeds from the fundamental assumption of the ONIOM method.\n\nLet the \"real\" system represent the entire molecular system of interest, and the \"model\" system be a specific, chemically active subset of the real system. Let $E_{\\mathrm{H}}$ denote an energy calculated with a high-level, accurate quantum mechanical method, and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ denote an energy calculated with a low-level, less computationally expensive quantum mechanical method.\n\nThe core assumption of the subtractive ONIOM scheme is based on the principle of transferability and locality. It is assumed that the energetic correction resulting from improving the level of theory from low to high is dominated by the electronic structure effects within the model system. In other words, the effect of the improved theory on the environment (the part of the real system not in the model system) is negligible. This can be expressed mathematically by equating the energy correction for the real system to the energy correction for the model system:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{real}} - E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{real}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}} - E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}}$$\nThis equation states that the change in energy upon moving from the low-level theory to the high-level theory is approximately the same whether we calculate it for the full \"real\" system or just the \"model\" subsystem.\n\nThe desired ONIOM energy, $E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}$, is the best approximation to the unknown high-level energy of the real system, $E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{real}}$. By rearranging the above approximation, we directly obtain the closed-form expression for the two-layer ONIOM energy:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}} \\equiv E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{real}} \\approx E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{real}} + E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}} - E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}}$$\nThis expression combines three computable quantities: the low-level energy of the entire real system ($E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{real}}$), and the high-level and low-level energies of the smaller model system ($E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}}$, respectively).\n\nA critical aspect of this method is the treatment of the boundary between the model system and its environment. When covalent bonds are cut to define the model system, the valency of atoms at the boundary must be saturated. This is typically achieved by adding \"link atoms\" (e.g., hydrogen atoms) to the model system. The energies $E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}}$ are therefore calculated for a capped model system that includes these link atoms. The validity of the ONIOM expression relies on the assumption that the energetic and electronic artifacts introduced by these artificial link atoms are similar at both the high and low levels of theory. Consequently, their contribution largely cancels out in the difference term, $(E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}} - E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}})$. The problem's condition that boundary treatments are consistent ensures this cancellation is properly handled.\n\nWe now apply this derived formula to compute the reaction energy, $\\Delta E$, for the transformation $\\text{R} \\longrightarrow \\text{P}$. The reaction energy is defined as $\\Delta E = E(\\text{P}) - E(\\text{R})$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ONIOM energy for the reactant, $\\text{R}$, using the given data:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{R}) = E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{real}}(\\text{R}) + E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\text{R}) - E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\text{R})$$\nSubstituting the numerical values in Hartree:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{R}) = -1500.000000 + (-400.000000) - (-399.500000)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{R}) = -1500.000000 - 0.500000 = -1500.500000 \\text{ Hartree}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the ONIOM energy for the product, $\\text{P}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{P}) = E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{real}}(\\text{P}) + E_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\text{P}) - E_{\\mathrm{L}}^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\text{P})$$\nSubstituting the numerical values in Hartree:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{P}) = -1499.980000 + (-400.020000) - (-399.515000)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{P}) = -1499.980000 - 0.505000 = -1500.485000 \\text{ Hartree}$$\n\nThe reaction energy $\\Delta E$ in Hartree is the difference between the product and reactant energies:\n$$\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{P}) - E_{\\mathrm{ONIOM}}(\\text{R})$$\n$$\\Delta E = -1500.485000 - (-1500.500000) = 0.015000 \\text{ Hartree}$$\n\nFinally, we convert this energy to kJ mol$^{-1}$ and round to four significant figures as required.\nUsing the conversion factor $1 \\text{ Hartree} = 2625.499 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$:\n$$\\Delta E (\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}) = 0.015000 \\text{ Hartree} \\times 2625.499 \\frac{\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}}{\\text{Hartree}}$$\n$$\\Delta E \\approx 39.382485 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $39.38$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{39.38}\n$$", "id": "2918475"}, {"introduction": "With the core energy formula established, the next practical challenge is partitioning a real molecular system.

The aim is to treat the central peptide bond region at a quantum mechanical level while describing the rest by a molecular mechanics force field. Starting from the following first principles and well-tested facts: (i) the multilayer subtractive scheme requires that the model system be a proper subset of the real system so that the high-level energy is transferred to the corresponding part of the real system without double counting, (ii) when a covalent bond is cut between layers, the valence of the quantum mechanical boundary atom must be satisfied by a link atom placed along the original bond direction at a chemically reasonable bond length to approximate the missing sigma bonding, and (iii) to minimize artifacts one should avoid cutting highly polar bonds and should treat the electrostatics near the boundary consistently so that the quantum region is not overpolarized by point charges representing atoms that have been replaced by link atoms, select the option that most appropriately defines the real and model systems and specifies the required link atom treatment for this system.\n\nWhich option is most appropriate?\n\nA. Real system is the full Ace–Gly–Ala–NMe molecule.

No link atoms are required because the peptide backbone is continuous within the model region.", "solution": "The problem requires the selection of the most appropriate Our N-layer Integrated molecular Orbital and molecular Mechanics (ONIOM) Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) setup for a capped dipeptide, acetyl-glycyl-alanine N-methylamide (`Ace-Gly-Ala-NMe`), based on fundamental principles of the method. The goal is to treat the central peptide bond region with quantum mechanics (QM) and the remainder of the molecule with molecular mechanics (MM).\n\nFirst, let us analyze the structure of the molecule:\nThe dipeptide `Ace-Gly-Ala-NMe` has the chemical structure:\n`CH_3-C(=O)-[NH-CH_2-C(=O)]_{Gly}-[NH-CH(CH_3)-C(=O)]_{Ala}-NH-CH_3`\n\nThe core principles of the ONIOM method, as stated in the problem, are:\n(i) The subtractive scheme is based on the energy expression:\n$$E_{\\text{ONIOM}} = E(\\text{low, real}) + E(\\text{high, model}) - E(\\text{low, model})$$\nHere, \"real\" refers to the entire molecule (`Ace-Gly-Ala-NMe`), \"model\" refers to a chemically saturated fragment containing the region of interest, \"low\" refers to the low-level of theory (MM), and \"high\" refers to the high-level of theory (QM). It is required that the model system be a proper subset of the real system.\n\n(ii) When a covalent bond between a QM atom and an MM atom is cut, the valence of the QM atom must be saturated. This is typically done by adding a \"link atom\", most commonly hydrogen ($H$), along the direction of the severed bond. This creates a chemically complete model system for the QM calculation.\n\n(iii) The electrostatic interaction between the QM region and the MM point charges must be handled carefully to avoid artifacts. In an \"electronic embedding\" scheme, the QM calculation is performed in the presence of the point charges of the MM atoms. To prevent unphysical polarization, the point charge of the MM atom directly bonded to the link atom is typically set to zero or redistributed to other nearby MM atoms. This is because the link atom electronically replaces that MM atom, and including its charge would be a form of double counting of the electrostatic effects. Cutting highly polar bonds should also be avoided.\n\nWith these principles, we will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Real system is the full Ace–Gly–Ala–NMe molecule. Model system is the central amide group connecting glycine and alanine, including the carbonyl $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}$, the amide $\\mathrm{N}$ and attached $\\mathrm{H}$, and both $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$ atoms.

This is consistent with principle (i).\n- **Model System Partition:** The region of interest is described as `...Cα(Gly)-C(=O)-N(H)-Cα(Ala)...`. The choice to cut the alanine `Cα-Cβ` bond is an excellent one. This bond is a non-polar `C-C` single bond, and its cleavage minimizes electronic perturbation, conforming to best practices derived from principle (iii).\n- **Link Atom Treatment:** The use of a single hydrogen link atom at the `Cα(Ala)-Cβ(Ala)` cut is described. This implies a specific partitioning scheme where the only part of the molecule moved to the MM layer is the alanine side chain (`-CH_3`). For this to require only a *single* link atom, the model system must be the entire rest of the molecule: `Ace-Gly-Ala(sidechain->H)-NMe`. This model system is `Ace-Gly-Gly-NMe`. This is a chemically sound and common partitioning strategy. The description of the model system in the option as \"the central amide group...\" is an imprecise but conceptually reasonable description of the *region of interest* that this partition is designed to study. The actual computational model system is derived from the real system by one cut and one link atom.\n- **Electrostatic Treatment:** The prescription to remove or redistribute the charge on the `Cβ` atom (the MM atom adjacent to the QM `Cα` boundary atom) is critically important and correct, as per principle (iii), to avoid overpolarizing the QM region.\n- **Verdict:** This option accurately describes a valid and well-justified ONIOM partitioning scheme. The procedure for handling the covalent boundary (`Cα-Cβ` cut) and the associated electrostatics is textbook-correct. The description of the model system is slightly ambiguous but does not invalidate the correctness of the stated procedures. Compared to other options, this one adheres best to all principles. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Real system is the full Ace–Gly–Ala–NMe molecule. Model system is only the minimal amide fragment $\\mathrm{CONH}$ without either $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$. Two hydrogen link atoms are added, one on the carbonyl $\\mathrm{C}$ to replace the glycine $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$ and one on the amide $\\mathrm{N}$ to replace the alanine $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$. Electrostatics are left unchanged for all molecular mechanics atoms to maximize polarization of the quantum region.**\n\n- **Model System Partition:** The choice of a minimal `CONH` fragment is generally poor. The `Cα` atoms are electronically and sterically integral to the peptide bond's properties, so excluding them from the QM region is not a chemically sound choice for studying this region.\n- **Electrostatic Treatment:** The statement \"Electrostatics are left unchanged for all molecular mechanics atoms\" is fundamentally incorrect. This would mean keeping the partial charges on the `Cα` atoms, which are now adjacent to the link atoms. This creates large, artificial dipoles at the boundary and leads to severe overpolarization of the QM electron density, a direct violation of principle (iii). The goal is not to \"maximize polarization\" but to represent it physically.\n- **Verdict:** This option proposes a poor model system and an incorrect electrostatic treatment that violates principle (iii). **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Real system is the central amide fragment only. Model system is the entire Ace–Gly–Ala–NMe molecule. No link atoms are required because the model contains the real system.**\n\n- **Real and Model System Definition:** This option inverts the definitions. According to principle (i), the model system (high-level) must be a subset of the real system (low-level). Here, the \"real\" system is defined as a fragment and the \"model\" system as the whole molecule. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ONIOM subtractive scheme.\n- **Verdict:** This option violates the basic definition of the ONIOM method as stated in principle (i). **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Real system is the full Ace–Gly–Ala–NMe molecule. Model system is the central amide group including both $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$ atoms. A heavy-atom “link carbon” is used instead of hydrogen at the cut $\\mathrm{C_{\\alpha}}$–$\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}}$ bond, placed at the original $\\mathrm{C}$–$\\mathrm{C}$ distance, and the molecular mechanics point charge on the truncated $\\mathrm{C_{\\beta}}$ is kept unchanged under electronic embedding to preserve the original field.**\n\n- **Link Atom Treatment:** The use of specialized \"heavy-atom\" link atoms is a valid, though less common, technique. This part is plausible.\n- **Electrostatic Treatment:** As in option B, the statement \"the molecular mechanics point charge on the truncated `Cβ` is kept unchanged\" is incorrect. It violates principle (iii) and leads to unphysical overpolarization at the QM/MM boundary. The claim that this \"preserve[s] the original field\" is a misinterpretation; it introduces a significant artifact.\n- **Verdict:** This option proposes an incorrect electrostatic treatment, making it invalid. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Real system is the full Ace–Gly–Ala–NMe molecule. Model system is the entire peptide backbone from the acetyl carbonyl through the amide nitrogen of N-methylamide, excluding both side chains. No link atoms are required because the peptide backbone is continuous within the model region.**\n\n- **Model System Partition:** The idea of treating the entire backbone as the QM region is reasonable. \"Excluding both side chains\" means cutting the bond to the alanine side chain (`-CH_3`). Glycine's side chain is just a hydrogen, so no cut is needed there.\n- **Link Atom Treatment:** The statement \"No link atoms are required\" is false. Cutting the `Cα-Cβ` bond in alanine leaves the `Cα` atom with an unsatisfied valence. According to principle (ii), a link atom is mandatory to create a chemically valid, closed-shell model system suitable for a QM calculation. The reasoning \"because the peptide backbone is continuous\" is irrelevant to the fact that a non-backbone bond has been cut.\n- **Verdict:** This option makes a factually incorrect claim about the need for link atoms, violating principle (ii). **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions B, C, D, and E all contain statements that are fundamentally incorrect and violate the principles of QM/MM calculations provided in the problem statement. Option A describes a partitioning choice (`Cα-Cβ` cut), a link atom strategy (H-link), and an electrostatic embedding scheme (charge removal/redistribution) that are all fully consistent with established best practices and the given principles. While its description of the molecular system is slightly imprecise, the procedures it outlines are correct.

The purpose is to produce a principled, quantitative recipe for selecting which bond to cut and to estimate the expected energy error that arises from using a mechanical embedding with a link atom. The surrogate consists of two coupled one-dimensional internal coordinates: a \"QM-side\" coordinate $x$ and an \"MM-side\" coordinate $y$. The total potential energy is modeled by a bilinear harmonic form\n$$\nV(x,y) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{m} y^2 + k_{c} x y,\n$$\nwhere $k_{q}$ is the stiffness of the dominant QM internal coordinate that spans the cut, $k_{m}$ is the stiffness of the dominant MM internal coordinate on the other side of the cut, and $k_{c}$ is the coupling constant that encodes how internal motions on each side are mechanically coupled across the cut.

To find the relaxed value of $y$, denoted $y_{\\text{relax}}$, we must solve for the stationary point of $V(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ for a fixed value of $x$. This is achieved by setting the partial derivative of $V$ with respect to $y$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V(x,y)}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (\\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{m} y^2 + k_{c} x y) = 0 + k_{m} y + k_{c} x\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero yields the condition for the relaxed position of $y$:\n$$\nk_{m} y_{\\text{relax}} + k_{c} x = 0\n$$\nSolving for $y_{\\text{relax}}$ as a function of $x$:\n$$\ny_{\\text{relax}}(x) = -\\frac{k_{c}}{k_{m}} x\n$$\nThe energy of the fully relaxed system for any given displacement $x$ is found by substituting $y_{\\text{relax}}(x)$ back into the original potential energy function $V(x,y)$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{full-relaxed}}(x) = V(x, y_{\\text{relax}}(x)) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{m} \\left(-\\frac{k_{c}}{k_{m}} x\\right)^2 + k_{c} x \\left(-\\frac{k_{c}}{k_{m}} x\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$\nV_{\\text{full-relaxed}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{m} \\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}^2} x^2 - \\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}} x^2\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{full-relaxed}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 + \\frac{k_{c}^2}{2 k_{m}} x^2 - \\frac{2k_{c}^2}{2 k_{m}} x^2\n$$\nThis simplifies to an effective one-dimensional potential for the coordinate $x$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{full-relaxed}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 - \\frac{k_{c}^2}{2 k_{m}} x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(k_{q} - \\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}}\\right) x^2\n$$\nThe term $-\\frac{k_{c}^2}{2k_m}x^2$ represents the relaxation energy. Evaluating this at the specified displacement $x=A$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{full-relaxed}}(A) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} A^2 - \\frac{k_{c}^2}{2 k_{m}} A^2\n$$\nNext, we determine the energy of the \"cut\" model, $V_{\\text{cut}}(A)$. The problem states this model involves removing the coupling term $k_{c}xy$ and fixing the MM-side coordinate $y$ at its equilibrium value, which is $y=0$. The potential for the cut model is thus:\n$$\nV_{\\text{cut-model}}(x,y) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{m} y^2\n$$\nThe energy $V_{\\text{cut}}(A)$ is the value of this potential at $x=A$ and $y=0$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{cut}}(A) = V_{\\text{cut-model}}(A, 0) = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} A^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{m} (0)^2 = \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} A^2\n$$\nFinally, the energy error $\\Delta E$ is the difference between these two energies:\n$$\n\\Delta E(A; k_{q}, k_{m}, k_{c}) = V_{\\text{cut}}(A) - V_{\\text{full-relaxed}}(A)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} A^2\\right) - \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} A^2 - \\frac{k_{c}^2}{2 k_{m}} A^2\\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\tfrac{1}{2} k_{q} A^2$, which represents the energy of displacing the QM-side coordinate in isolation, cancels out. This cancellation is a direct consequence of the problem definitions and shows that the error arises entirely from neglecting the relaxation of the MM system that is coupled to the QM system. The resulting closed-form expression for the energy error is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{k_{c}^2 A^2}{2 k_{m}}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the displacement amplitude $A$, the coupling constant $k_{c}$, and the stiffness of the MM-side coordinate $k_{m}$. Notably, the stiffness of the QM-side coordinate, $k_{q}$, does not contribute to this error metric.\n\nTask 2: Decision Rule (Recipe) for Bond Cutting\nThe goal of a good QM/MM partitioning scheme is to minimize the artificial energetic effects introduced by the boundary. In our model, this corresponds to minimizing the energy error $\\Delta E$ due to the mechanical embedding. From the derived formula, $\\Delta E = \\frac{k_{c}^2 A^2}{2 k_{m}}$, we can see that for a typical, non-zero displacement $A$, the error is governed by the ratio $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}}$.\n\nTherefore, the quantitative recipe for choosing the optimal cut among a set of candidates is:\n**For each candidate bond cut, estimate the coupling constant $k_{c}$ and the MM-side stiffness $k_{m}$ from a suitable small-molecule surrogate (e.g., an amide like N-methylacetamide). Calculate the criterion $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}}$. The preferred cut is the one that minimizes this value.**\n\nThis recipe is justified because a smaller value of $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}}$ directly leads to a smaller energy error for any given perturbation along the QM-side coordinate. A small coupling $k_{c}$ means the two sides are mechanically decoupled, so cutting the bond has little effect. A large MM-side stiffness $k_{m}$ means the MM region is very rigid and would not have relaxed much anyway, even if the coupling were present, again leading to a small error.\n\nTo connect $k_c$ and $k_m$ to standard computational chemistry outputs, we consider the Hessian matrix of the potential energy, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives. For the potential $V(x,y)$, the Hessian matrix $H$ in the basis of coordinates $(x,y)$ is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCalculating the second derivatives of $V(x,y)$:\n- $\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = k_{q}$\n- $\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} = k_{m}$\n- $\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = k_{c}$\nSo, the Hessian matrix is:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} k_{q} & k_{c} \\\\ k_{c} & k_{m} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this, it is evident that:\n- The parameter $k_{m}$ is the diagonal element of the Hessian matrix corresponding to the MM-side coordinate $y$, often denoted $H_{yy}$ or $H_{22}$. This is the force constant for that coordinate.\n- The parameter $k_{c}$ is the off-diagonal element of the Hessian matrix that couples the coordinates $x$ and $y$, denoted $H_{xy}$ or $H_{12}$.\n\nThus, the recipe can be stated in terms of Hessian elements calculated for a surrogate molecule: Choose the cut that minimizes the ratio $\\frac{(H_{xy})^2}{H_{yy}}$.\n\nTask 3: Computation\nThe derived formula $\\Delta E = \\frac{k_{c}^2 A^2}{2 k_{m}}$ will be implemented. For Case 6, we must select the index from $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ corresponding to the cut from Cases 1-3 that yields the minimum $\\Delta E$. Since the displacement $A$ is identical for Cases 1-3, this is equivalent to finding the minimum of the ratio $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}}$ for these three cases.\n- Case 1: $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}} = \\frac{30^2}{350} = \\frac{900}{350} \\approx 2.5714$\n- Case 2: $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}} = \\frac{50^2}{300} = \\frac{2500}{300} \\approx 8.3333$\n- Case 3: $\\frac{k_{c}^2}{k_{m}} = \\frac{120^2}{320} = \\frac{14400}{320} = 45.0$\nThe minimum value occurs for Case 1. Therefore, the recommended cut corresponds to index $0$.
