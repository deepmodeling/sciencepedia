It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem based on standard principles in computational chemistry. Therefore, I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of a three-atom system $\\{A, B, C\\}$ where the Quantum Mechanical (QM) region is defined as $Q = \\{A, B\\}$ and the Molecular Mechanics (MM) region implicitly contains atom $C$ and the classical representation of atoms in $Q$. The analysis requires deriving expressions for a naive additive energy, a nonredundant energy based on the inclusion-exclusion principle, and the resulting overcounting error. The entire model operates under the simplifying assumption of pairwise additivity for potential energies at both the QM and MM levels of theory.\n\nFirst, we address the task of enumerating all pair interactions in the naive additive construction. The naive mixed-resolution energy, $E_{\\mathrm{naive}}$, is defined as the sum of the QM energy of the QM region, $E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q)$, and the MM energy of the full system, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\{A,B,C\\})$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{naive}} = E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q) + E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\{A,B,C\\})$$\nThe QM region is $Q = \\{A, B\\}$. The problem states there is a single pairwise QM interaction term, $u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$, for this region. Thus, the QM energy contribution is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(Q) = u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$$\nThe full system is $\\{A, B, C\\}$. The MM potential energy is assumed to be pairwise additive, meaning it is the sum of all distinct pair potentials. The pairs in this system are $(A,B)$, $(A,C)$, and $(B,C)$. The corresponding MM energy is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\{A,B,C\\}) = u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC})$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $E_{\\mathrm{naive}}$, we obtain:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{naive}} = u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC})$$\nThe pair interactions included in this naive construction are therefore explicitly:\n$1$. The QM interaction between $A$ and $B$, $u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$.\n$2$. The MM interaction between $A$ and $B$, $u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$.\n$3$. The MM interaction between $A$ and $C$, $u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC})$.\n$4$. The MM interaction between $B$ and $C$, $u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC})$.\nIt is evident that the interaction between atoms $A$ and $B$ is accounted for twice, once at the QM level and once at the MM level. This is the source of the \"double counting\" error.\n\nNext, we derive the nonredundant mixed energy expression, $E_{\\mathrm{nonred}}$, using the inclusion-exclusion principle. This principle, applied to QM/MM, provides the foundation for subtractive schemes, designed precisely to eliminate such double counting. The energy of the system is better approximated by taking the high-level (QM) description of the core region, adding the low-level (MM) description of the entire system, and then subtracting the low-level (MM) description of the core region, which was included in both of the previous terms.\nThe general formula is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nonred}} = E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(\\text{QM region}) + E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\text{Total system}) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\text{QM region})$$\nIn our specific case, the QM region is $Q = \\{A, B\\}$ and the total system is $\\{A, B, C\\}$. We have already defined the first two terms. The third term is the MM energy of the QM region, $E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q)$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(Q) = E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\{A,B\\}) = u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$$\nThis term represents the interaction within the QM region as described by the MM force field.\nNow, we construct $E_{\\mathrm{nonred}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nonred}} = E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(\\{A,B\\}) + E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\{A,B,C\\}) - E_{\\mathrm{MM}}(\\{A,B\\})$$\nSubstituting the explicit potential expressions:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nonred}} = u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + \\left( u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC}) \\right) - u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$$\nThe term $u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$ cancels, yielding the nonredundant energy expression:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nonred}} = u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC})$$\nThis expression is physically intuitive: the interaction internal to the QM region is described quantum mechanically, while interactions between the QM region and the MM environment are described molecular mechanically.\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the overcounting error, $\\Delta$, defined as the difference between the naive and nonredundant energies:\n$$\\Delta \\equiv E_{\\mathrm{naive}} - E_{\\mathrm{nonred}}$$\nUsing the expressions derived above:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{naive}} = u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nonred}} = u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC})$$\nThe subtraction is straightforward:\n$$\\Delta = \\left( u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC}) \\right) - \\left( u_{\\mathrm{QM}}^{AB}(r_{AB}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AC}(r_{AC}) + u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{BC}(r_{BC}) \\right)$$\nUpon cancellation of like terms, we are left with:\n$$\\Delta = u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})$$\nThe overcounting error is precisely the MM potential energy for the interaction within the QM region, which confirms that the subtractive scheme correctly identifies and removes the source of redundancy in the naive additive model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{u_{\\mathrm{MM}}^{AB}(r_{AB})}\n$$", "id": "2872903"}, {"introduction": "While subtractive schemes correctly handle double-counting, their ultimate accuracy depends on a delicate cancellation of errors from the high-level and low-level methods.

I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Net Error of the Subtractive Scheme**\nThe primary task is to find an expression for the net error of the subtractive estimate, $\\Delta E$, which is the difference between the estimated energy $E_{\\text{sub}}$ and the true energy of the whole system, $E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole})$.\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{\\text{sub}} - E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) $$\nThe subtractive energy is given as:\n$$ E_{\\text{sub}} = E_{L}(\\text{whole}) + E_{H}(\\text{model}) - E_{L}(\\text{model}) $$\nSubstituting this into the error expression:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\left( E_{L}(\\text{whole}) + E_{H}(\\text{model}) - E_{L}(\\text{model}) \\right) - E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) $$\nThe definition of method error is $\\delta_{X}(S) = E_{X}(S) - E_{\\text{true}}(S)$. We can rearrange this to write the computed energy as the sum of the true energy and the error: $E_{X}(S) = E_{\\text{true}}(S) + \\delta_{X}(S)$.\nLet us substitute this form for each term in the expression for $\\Delta E$:\n- $E_{L}(\\text{whole}) = E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) + \\delta_{L}(\\text{whole})$\n- $E_{H}(\\text{model}) = E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$\n- $E_{L}(\\text{model}) = E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\Delta E$:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\left( E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) + \\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) \\right) + \\left( E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) \\right) - \\left( E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) \\right) - E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) $$\nWe can collect and cancel terms:\n$$ \\Delta E = (E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) - E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole})) + (E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model}) - E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model})) + \\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) $$\nThe true energy terms cancel out, leaving the final expression for the net error:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) $$\nThis equation shows that the net error of the subtractive scheme is the sum of two components: ($1$) the difference in the low-level error between the whole and model systems, and ($2$) the high-level error on the model system.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of the Net Error**\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) = -10\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) = -8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = +5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$$ \\Delta E = (-10\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) - (-8\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) + (+5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta E = -10 + 8 + 5\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = +3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThe net error is $\\Delta E = +3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Since the error is positive ($\\Delta E > 0$), it signifies that $E_{\\text{sub}} > E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole})$.

With the numbers given, the subtractive estimate $E_{\\text{sub}}$ underbinds the trimer relative to $E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole})$ by $3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.**\nOur calculation yields a net error $\\Delta E = +3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. A positive error indicates the estimated energy is too high, which is underbinding. The magnitude is $3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Therefore, this statement is factually correct based on our derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In general, the subtractive scheme’s net error can be written as the sum of the low-level error on the environment outside the model region and the high-level error on the model region.**\nThe derived net error is $\\Delta E = (\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$.\nThe term $\\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$ is, by definition, the high-level error on the model region.\nThe term $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})$ represents how the error of the low-level method changes when moving from the model system to the whole system. This can be physically interpreted as the error of the low-level method in describing the contribution of the environment (and its interaction with the model). To be precise, let the energy contribution of the environment be $\\Delta E_{\\text{env}} = E(\\text{whole}) - E(\\text{model})$. The error in the low-level calculation of this contribution is $\\delta_L(\\text{env}) = (E_L(\\text{whole}) - E_L(\\text{model})) - (E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole}) - E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{model})) = \\delta_L(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_L(\\text{model})$. Thus, the statement provides a correct physical interpretation of the terms in the error equation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because the low-level method overbinds and the high-level method underbinds, the errors necessarily cancel exactly, so $E_{\\text{sub}} = E_{\\text{true}}(\\text{whole})$.**\nThis statement proposes that if $\\delta_L$ is negative and $\\delta_H$ is positive, exact cancellation ($\\Delta E = 0$) must occur. Our numerical calculation provides a direct counterexample: $\\Delta E = +3\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} \\neq 0$. The condition for exact cancellation is $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = 0$. There is no fundamental principle dictating that this condition is met just because the errors of the individual methods have opposite signs.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) = \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})$, then exact cancellation occurs independent of the high-level error.**\nThe condition for exact cancellation is $\\Delta E = 0$. The net error is $\\Delta E = \\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$. If we assume $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) = \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})$, the error expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta E = (\\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) $$\nFor exact cancellation ($\\Delta E = 0$), it would require that $\\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = 0$. This contradicts the claim that cancellation occurs \"independent of the high-level error\". The condition $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) = \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})$ is the key assumption for the reliability of the ONIOM scheme, as it reduces the total error to the error of the high-level method on the small model system, but it does not make the total error zero.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Exact cancellation occurs if and only if $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = 0$, which is equivalent to requiring that the low-level error on the environment be the negative of the high-level error on the model region.**\nThis statement consists of two parts.\nFirst part: \"Exact cancellation occurs if and only if $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = 0$\". Exact cancellation means $\\Delta E = 0$. Our derived formula is $\\Delta E = \\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$. Setting this to zero gives the exact condition stated. This is correct.\nSecond part: \"...which is equivalent to requiring that the low-level error on the environment be the negative of the high-level error on the model region.\" As established in the analysis of option B, the \"low-level error on the environment\" is the term $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})$. The \"high-level error on the model region\" is $\\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$. The statement claims the condition is $(\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model})) = - \\delta_{H}(\\text{model})$. Rearranging this gives $\\delta_{L}(\\text{whole}) - \\delta_{L}(\\text{model}) + \\delta_{H}(\\text{model}) = 0$, which is identical to the condition for exact cancellation.

It describes a genuine challenge in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations known as overpolarization, which arises from the use of unphysical point charges in the molecular mechanics (MM) force field when they are in close proximity to the polarizable quantum mechanical (QM) electron density. The task is to identify a suitable distance-dependent scaling function, $s(r)$, for the MM charges that rectifies this short-range artifact while satisfying critical physical and numerical constraints.\n\nThe necessary properties of a satisfactory scaling function $s(r)$, where $r$ is the distance from an MM charge to the QM region, are derived from the problem's stated goals:\n\n$1$. **Attenuation of the near-field:** The external electric field from an MM charge $q_I$ scales as $q_I/r^2$. The divergence as $r \\to 0$ causes unphysical polarization. The function $s(r)$ must therefore counteract this divergence. This requires that $s(r)$ must tend towards zero as $r \\to 0$, or at least that the product $s(r)/r^2$ remains bounded. A simple and effective way to ensure this is to have $\\lim_{r\\to 0} s(r) = 0$.\n\n$2$. **Preservation of long-range electrostatics:** At large distances, the point-charge approximation is physically valid. Therefore, the scaling function must not alter the long-range interactions. This dictates that for large $r$, $s(r)$ must approach unity. Formally, $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} s(r) = 1$. The problem suggests a cutoff distance $r_c$ beyond which the original interaction is restored, i.e., $s(r)=1$ for $r \\ge r_c$.\n\n$3$. **Continuity of energy and forces:** For stable numerical simulations, such as molecular dynamics or geometry optimization, the potential energy surface must be smooth. A discontinuity in the total energy $E$ as a function of atomic coordinates would lead to infinite forces, which is unphysical. This requires the scaling function $s(r)$ to be continuous. Furthermore, a discontinuity in the forces $\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla E$ must also be avoided. This requires the first derivative of the energy, and thus the first derivative of the scaling function, $s'(r)$, to be continuous. Therefore, $s(r)$ must be at least a continuously differentiable function, or class $C^1$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these three fundamental criteria.\n\n**A. Scale all MM charges by a uniform constant $c \\in (0,1)$ irrespective of distance, i.e., $s(r) = c$.**\nThis function is of class $C^\\infty$, so it satisfies criterion $3$. It attenuates the field everywhere by a constant factor $c$, partially addressing criterion $1$, although it does not eliminate the divergence as $r \\to 0$. However, it fundamentally fails criterion $2$. By setting $s(r) = c \\neq 1$ for all $r$, it incorrectly modifies the physically correct long-range electrostatic interactions. This introduces a systematic error into the model. The rationale that it does not alter long-range behavior is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Use a local, smooth switching function...**\nThe proposed function is:\n$$\ns(r) = \n\\begin{cases}\n0,  r \\le r_0, \\\\\n\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left[1 - \\cos\\left(\\pi \\dfrac{r - r_0}{r_c - r_0}\\right)\\right],  r_0  r  r_c, \\\\\n1,  r \\ge r_c,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n$1$. **Near-field:** For $r \\le r_0$, $s(r) = 0$. This completely eliminates the contribution from very close charges, definitively preventing overpolarization. This satisfies criterion $1$.\n$2$. **Long-range:** For $r \\ge r_c$, $s(r) = 1$. This exactly preserves the long-range electrostatic potential as required by criterion $2$.\n$3$. **Continuity:** We must check the function $s(r)$ and its derivative $s'(r)$ at the boundaries $r_0$ and $r_c$.\n- At $r = r_0$: $\\lim_{r \\to r_0^+} \\frac{1}{2}[1 - \\cos(0)] = 0$. This matches the value for $r \\le r_0$. Thus, $s(r)$ is continuous.\n- At $r = r_c$: $\\lim_{r \\to r_c^-} \\frac{1}{2}[1 - \\cos(\\pi)] = \\frac{1}{2}[1 - (-1)] = 1$. This matches the value for $r \\ge r_c$. Thus, $s(r)$ is continuous.\nThe derivative for $r_0  r  r_c$ is $s'(r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2(r_c-r_0)} \\sin(\\pi \\frac{r-r_0}{r_c-r_0})$.\n- At $r = r_0$: The derivative from the left is $0$. The derivative from the right is $\\lim_{r \\to r_0^+} s'(r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2(r_c-r_0)} \\sin(0) = 0$. The derivative is continuous.\n- At $r = r_c$: The derivative from the right is $0$. The derivative from the left is $\\lim_{r \\to r_c^-} s'(r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2(r_c-r_0)} \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. The derivative is continuous.\nSince both $s(r)$ and $s'(r)$ are continuous, the function is of class $C^1$ and criterion $3$ is satisfied. The rationale provided is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Exclude all MM charges within a cutoff by a Heaviside step, $s(r) = 0$ for $r  r_c$ and $s(r) = 1$ for $r \\ge r_c$.**\nThis function has a jump discontinuity at $r=r_c$, where it jumps from $0$ to $1$. This causes a discontinuity in the potential energy, leading to infinite forces. This is a catastrophic failure of criterion $3$. Such a scheme is numerically unstable and physically meaningless at the cutoff boundary.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Choose $s(r) = (r/r_c)^2$ for $r \\le r_c$ and $s(r) = 1$ for $r \\ge r_c$.**\n$1$. **Near-field:** For $r \\le r_c$, the effective field strength from a charge $q$ is proportional to $s(r) q/r^2 = (r/r_c)^2 q/r^2 = q/r_c^2$, which is a constant. This bounds the field and prevents divergence as $r \\to 0$, satisfying criterion $1$.\n$2$. **Long-range:** For $r \\ge r_c$, $s(r)=1$, satisfying criterion $2$.\n$3$. **Continuity:**\n- At $r = r_c$, the function value from the left is $(r_c/r_c)^2=1$, which matches the value from the right. The function $s(r)$ is continuous, so the energy is continuous.\n- The derivative for $r  r_c$ is $s'(r) = 2r/r_c^2$. At $r=r_c$, the derivative from the left is $2r_c/r_c^2 = 2/r_c$. The derivative for $r  r_c$ is $0$.\nSince $2/r_c \\neq 0$ (for any finite $r_c$), the first derivative $s'(r)$ is discontinuous at $r=r_c$. This leads to a discontinuity in the forces, which violates criterion $3$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Use a Fermi-type smooth function $s(r) = \\big(1 + e^{-(r - r_c)/a}\\big)^{-1}$.**\n$1$. **Near-field:** As $r \\to 0$, $-(r-r_c)/a \\to r_c/a$. If $r_c/a$ is sufficiently large and positive, $e^{-(r-r_c)/a}$ becomes large, and $s(r) \\to 0$. This satisfies criterion $1$.\n$2$. **Long-range:** As $r \\to \\infty$, $-(r-r_c)/a \\to -\\infty$, so $e^{-(r-r_c)/a} \\to 0$. Thus, $s(r) \\to (1+0)^{-1}=1$. This satisfies criterion $2$. However, note that $s(r)$ only approaches $1$ asymptotically; it is not exactly $1$ for any finite $r$.\n$3$. **Continuity:** The Fermi-Dirac function is of class $C^\\infty$, meaning it and all its derivatives are continuous. Criterion $3$ is perfectly satisfied.\nThis option describes another valid approach. However, when compared to option B, there is a subtle but important distinction. The stated goal is to \"preserve physically correct long-range electrostatics\". The function in option B achieves this *exactly* for all $r \\ge r_c$. The function in option E only achieves this *asymptotically*, technically modifying the Coulomb potential at all distances, even if the modification is negligible for large $r$. Therefore, the function and rationale in option B represent a more precise and direct implementation of the stated goals. The piecewise construction is standard for switching functions and its explicit restoration of the true potential beyond a cutoff is a desirable feature.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option B provides a function and a rationale that are fully consistent with all stated requirements, including the exact preservation of long-range physics, which is a key design goal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2872883"}]}
