Do not round.", "solution": "The solution is organized according to the four tasks presented in the problem.\n\n**Task 1: Maximal Schmidt Rank**\n\nTo determine the Schmidt rank of the state $|\\mathrm{GHZ}_{L}\\rangle$, we perform a bipartition of the chain of $L$ sites into two subsystems. Let subsystem $A$ consist of sites $1$ through $k$, and subsystem $B$ consist of sites $k+1$ through $L$, for any $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le L-1$.\n\nThe state is given by\n$$|\\mathrm{GHZ}_{L}\\rangle \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Big(|0\\rangle^{\\otimes L} \\;+\\; |1\\rangle^{\\otimes L}\\Big).$$\nWe can rewrite this state by factoring out the basis states for subsystems $A$ and $B$:\n$$|\\mathrm{GHZ}_{L}\\rangle \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Big( (|0\\rangle^{\\otimes k} \\otimes |0\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)}) \\;+\\; (|1\\rangle^{\\otimes k} \\otimes |1\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)}) \\Big).$$\nLet us define the states for subsystem $A$ as $|\\psi_1\\rangle_A = |0\\rangle^{\\otimes k}$ and $|\\psi_2\\rangle_A = |1\\rangle^{\\otimes k}$. These two states are orthonormal. Similarly, for subsystem $B$, let us define $|\\phi_1\\rangle_B = |0\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)}$ and $|\\phi_2\\rangle_B = |1\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)}$. These two states are also orthonormal.\n\nWith these definitions, the state $|\\mathrm{GHZ}_{L}\\rangle$ can be written as\n$$|\\mathrm{GHZ}_{L}\\rangle \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |\\psi_1\\rangle_A |\\phi_1\\rangle_B \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |\\psi_2\\rangle_A |\\phi_2\\rangle_B.$$\nThis expression is in the form of a Schmidt decomposition, $|\\Psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\lambda_i |\\psi_i\\rangle_A |\\phi_i\\rangle_B$, where $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ are the Schmidt coefficients and $\\{|\\psi_i\\rangle_A\\}$ and $\\{|\\phi_i\\rangle_B\\}$ are sets of orthonormal Schmidt vectors for the respective subsystems.\n\nIn our case, the Schmidt coefficients are $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The Schmidt rank, $r$, is the number of non-zero Schmidt coefficients. For any cut $k$, we find there are exactly two non-zero coefficients. Thus, the Schmidt rank for any bipartition of the GHZ state is $r(k)=2$.\n\nThe maximal Schmidt rank, $r_{\\max}$, is the maximum of $r(k)$ over all possible cuts $k=1, \\dots, L-1$. Since the rank is constant, we have\n$$r_{\\max} = \\max_{k} \\{r(k)\\} = 2.$$\n\n**Task 2: Minimal Bond Dimension**\n\nThe problem states a fundamental theorem of MPS theory: for a state to be represented exactly by an MPS, the bond dimension $D_k$ across any cut $k$ must be at least as large as the Schmidt rank $r(k)$ across that same cut. That is, $D_k \\ge r(k)$.\n\nThe overall bond dimension $D$ of an MPS is defined as the maximum of all intermediate bond dimensions, $D = \\max_{1 \\le k \\le L-1} D_k$. For an exact representation, it is necessary that $D \\ge \\max_{k} r(k) = r_{\\max}$.\n\nFrom Task 1, we found that $r_{\\max}=2$. Therefore, the minimal bond dimension $D_{\\min}$ required for an exact MPS representation of $|\\mathrm{GHZ}_L\\rangle$ must satisfy\n$$D_{\\min} \\ge r_{\\max} = 2.$$\nThe existence of a representation with bond dimension $2$ confirms that the minimal bond dimension is exactly $D_{\\min}=2$. The construction of such a representation is the subject of the next task.\n\n**Task 3: Construction of MPS Tensors**\n\nWe seek to construct a set of tensors $\\{A^{[n]s_n}\\}$ with bond dimension $D=2$ that exactly generates the $|\\mathrm{GHZ}_L\\rangle$ state. The matrix dimensions are as follows:\n- For the left boundary, site $n=1$: $A^{[1]s_1}$ are $1 \\times 2$ matrices (row vectors).\n- For the bulk, sites $n=2, \\dots, L-1$: $A^{[n]s_n}$ are $2 \\times 2$ matrices.\n- For the right boundary, site $n=L$: $A^{[L]s_L}$ are $2 \\times 1$ matrices (column vectors).\n\nThe construction must yield the amplitude $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ for the state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes L}$, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ for $|1\\rangle^{\\otimes L}$, and $0$ for all other computational basis states. This suggests a structure where the \"all-zeros\" and \"all-ones\" configurations are completely decoupled.\n\nLet us define the matrices as follows.\n\nFor the left boundary site ($n=1$):\n$$ A^{[1]0} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A^{[1]1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}. $$\n\nFor the bulk sites ($n=2, \\dots, L-1$):\n$$ A^{[n]0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A^{[n]1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\n\nFor the right boundary site ($n=L$):\n$$ A^{[L]0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A^{[L]1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\n\nThe nonzero entries are:\n- For $n=1$: $(A^{[1]0})_{11} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $(A^{[1]1})_{12} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n- For $n=2, \\dots, L-1$: $(A^{[n]0})_{11} = 1$, $(A^{[n]1})_{22} = 1$.\n- For $n=L$: $(A^{[L]0})_{11} = 1$, $(A^{[L]1})_{21} = 1$.\nAll other matrix elements are zero.\n\nNow we verify the amplitudes.\nFor the state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes L}$:\n$$ A^{[1]0} A^{[2]0} \\cdots A^{[L]0} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^{L-2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}. $$\n\nFor the state $|1\\rangle^{\\otimes L}$:\n$$ A^{[1]1} A^{[2]1} \\cdots A^{[L]1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^{L-2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}. $$\n\nFor any other state, which must contain at least one $|0\\rangle$ and at least one $|1\\rangle$, the product of matrices will contain a product of the form $A^{[n]0} A^{[n+1]1}$ or $A^{[n]1} A^{[n+1]0}$ (or similar products involving boundary matrices). For example,\n$$ A^{[n]0} A^{[n+1]1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}. $$\nThis zero matrix nullifies the entire product. Consequently, any mixed string of spins results in an amplitude of $0$.\n\nThe constructed MPS tensors exactly represent the state $|\\mathrm{GHZ}_L\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle^{\\otimes L} + |1\\rangle^{\\otimes L})$, which is normalized as $\\langle \\mathrm{GHZ}_L | \\mathrm{GHZ}_L \\rangle = (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = 1$. The construction utilizes a bond dimension $D=2$, thus confirming that $D_{\\min} = 2$.\n\n**Task 4: Direct Verification of Bond Dimension**\n\nWe can verify that the constructed MPS has a Schmidt rank of $2$ across any bond. Consider again the bipartition into sites $A=\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ and $B=\\{k+1,\\dots,L\\}$. The state can be written as\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{D_k} |\\Phi_\\alpha\\rangle_A |\\tilde{\\Phi}_\\alpha\\rangle_B $$\nwhere the (unnormalized) states $|\\Phi_\\alpha\\rangle_A$ and $|\\tilde{\\Phi}_\\alpha\\rangle_B$ are built from the MPS tensors. Specifically, for a bond dimension $D_k=2$,\n$$ |\\Phi_1\\rangle_A = \\sum_{s_1,...,s_k} (A^{[1]s_1} \\dots A^{[k]s_k})_{11} |s_1, \\dots, s_k \\rangle $$\n$$ |\\Phi_2\\rangle_A = \\sum_{s_1,...,s_k} (A^{[1]s_1} \\dots A^{[k]s_k})_{12} |s_1, \\dots, s_k \\rangle $$\nand similarly for the right part.\nUsing our tensor construction:\nThe product $A^{[1]s_1} \\dots A^{[k]s_k}$ (for $1  k  L$) is non-zero only for two cases:\n1. $s_1=\\dots=s_k=0$: The product evaluates to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n2. $s_1=\\dots=s_k=1$: The product evaluates to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor all other spin configurations on subsystem $A$, the product is a zero vector.\nThis implies:\n$$ |\\Phi_1\\rangle_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |0\\rangle^{\\otimes k} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\Phi_2\\rangle_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1\\rangle^{\\otimes k}. $$\n\nSimilarly, for subsystem $B$:\nThe product $A^{[k+1]s_{k+1}} \\dots A^{[L]s_L}$ is non-zero only for:\n1. $s_{k+1}=\\dots=s_L=0$: The product is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n2. $s_{k+1}=\\dots=s_L=1$: The product is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis leads to:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\Phi}_1\\rangle_B = |0\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\tilde{\\Phi}_2\\rangle_B = |1\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)}. $$\nThe total state is then reconstructed as:\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle = |\\Phi_1\\rangle_A |\\tilde{\\Phi}_1\\rangle_B + |\\Phi_2\\rangle_A |\\tilde{\\Phi}_2\\rangle_B = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |0\\rangle^{\\otimes k} |0\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |1\\rangle^{\\otimes k} |1\\rangle^{\\otimes (L-k)}. $$\nThe resulting states $\\{ |\\Phi_1\\rangle_A, |\\Phi_2\\rangle_A \\}$ and $\\{ |\\tilde{\\Phi}_1\\rangle_B, |\\tilde{\\Phi}_2\\rangle_B \\}$ are proportional to orthonormal sets. Normalizing them gives the Schmidt vectors found in Task 1. The decomposition has two terms, confirming that the Schmidt rank across any bond $k$ is $r(k)=2$.

To probe the local curvature faithfully while preserving the normalization constraint to leading order, one should project the injected random perturbation onto the constrained tangent space orthogonal to $x_{\\star}$ and choose its amplitude small relative to a local energy scale, so that the second-order term governs the energy change; this justifies the practice of adding small noise to escape spurious minima without destabilizing well-conditioned minima.\n\nAnswer by selecting the correct options.", "solution": "The core of the problem is the local optimization of the energy with respect to a single tensor $x$ at site $i$, subject to the normalization constraint $x^{\\dagger}x = 1$. The energy is given by the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}(x) = x^{\\dagger} H_{\\mathrm{eff}} x$, where $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective Hamiltonian acting on site $i$. A stationary point $x_{\\star}$ of this optimization problem is an eigenvector of $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, satisfying $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} x_{\\star} = E_{\\star} x_{\\star}$, where $E_{\\star} = \\mathcal{R}(x_{\\star})$ is the corresponding energy. Typically, one seeks the ground state, so $x_{\\star}$ would be the eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue of $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. However, the iterative nature of DMRG can lead to convergence to any stationary point, i.e., any eigenvector.\n\nWe analyze the stability of such a stationary point $x_{\\star}$ by considering a small perturbation $\\delta x$. The problem specifies that this perturbation is in the tangent space and orthogonal to $x_{\\star}$, so we have $x_{\\star}^{\\dagger} \\delta x = 0$. The new state is $x' = (x_{\\star} + \\delta x) / \\|x_{\\star} + \\delta x\\|$. The energy of the new state is $\\mathcal{R}(x')$. Let us perform a Taylor expansion for small $\\|\\delta x\\|$.\nThe normalized state is $x' \\approx (x_{\\star} + \\delta x) (1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta x^{\\dagger} \\delta x)$, preserving normalization to second order.\nThe energy is $\\mathcal{R}(x') = (x')^{\\dagger} H_{\\mathrm{eff}} x'$. The change in energy $\\Delta E = \\mathcal{R}(x') - E_{\\star}$ is, to second order in $\\delta x$:\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\delta x^{\\dagger} (H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - E_{\\star} I) \\delta x $$\nThis quadratic form $\\delta x^{\\dagger} (H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - E_{\\star} I) \\delta x$ defines the action of the constrained Hessian on the tangent vector $\\delta x$. The operator $P_{\\perp}(H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - E_{\\star} I)P_{\\perp}$, where $P_{\\perp} = I - x_{\\star}x_{\\star}^{\\dagger}$ is the projector onto the space orthogonal to $x_{\\star}$, is the Hessian of the Rayleigh quotient on the sphere $x^\\dagger x=1$. The nature of the stationary point $x_{\\star}$ depends on the spectrum of this Hessian on the *physical tangent space*.\n\n- If the Hessian is positive definite (all eigenvalues $ 0$), $x_{\\star}$ is a stable local minimum. $\\Delta E  0$ for any small physical perturbation.\n- If the Hessian has at least one negative eigenvalue, $x_{\\star}$ is a saddle point. There exists a direction $\\delta x$ where $\\Delta E  0$.\n- If the Hessian has zero eigenvalues, there are flat directions where the energy does not change to second order.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. If the constrained Hessian at $x_{\\star}$ has at least one negative eigenvalue along a physical tangent direction, then $x_{\\star}$ is a saddle point. A generic arbitrarily small random perturbation has a component along a downhill direction and can lower the energy, enabling the sweep to leave the unstable stationary point.**\nThis statement is a direct application of optimization theory. The existence of a negative eigenvalue of the Hessian at a stationary point is the definition of a saddle point (for a minimization problem). A direction $\\delta x$ corresponding to a negative eigenvalue is a descent direction, as $\\Delta E \\approx \\delta x^{\\dagger} (H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - E_{\\star} I) \\delta x  0$. A randomly generated perturbation will, with probability $1$, have a non-zero projection onto any given direction in the vector space. Therefore, a random perturbation will contain a component along this downhill direction. When such a perturbation is added to $x_{\\star}$, the resulting state has a lower energy. The next step of the local eigensolver, seeking the lowest energy, will naturally follow this descent path away from the unstable saddle point. This statement is a cornerstone of why adding noise is effective.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If the constrained Hessian is strictly positive definite with a large spectral gap, then adding random noise generically accelerates convergence of the exact one-site eigenproblem by enabling larger descent steps due to a stochastic resonance effect, even without changing the manifold chart.**\nA strictly positive definite Hessian with a large spectral gap characterizes a strong, well-conditioned local minimum. The energy landscape is steep in all directions. Iterative eigensolvers like Davidson, which are used in DMRG, are very efficient in such scenarios and converge quickly. Adding random noise to the state $x_{\\star}$ would perturb it *away* from this minimum, increasing its energy. The solver would then have to perform work to return to the minimum. This slows down, not accelerates, convergence. The term \"stochastic resonance\" refers to a specific, unrelated phenomenon where noise can enhance the detection of a weak periodic signal and is misused here. There is no known mechanism by which random noise would enable \"larger descent steps\" in this context; on the contrary, it adds an ascent step that must be corrected.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Exact MPS gauge redundancies manifest as a null space of the constrained Hessian; adding random noise in these null directions changes the physical state and can systematically reduce the energy, even if no physical tangent direction exhibits negative or near-zero curvature.**\nMPS gauge transformations are changes to the individual tensors that leave the physical quantum state, and thus its properties like energy, unchanged. A perturbation $\\delta x_{\\mathrm{gauge}}$ corresponding to an infinitesimal gauge transformation must therefore result in $\\Delta E = 0$. This implies that $\\delta x_{\\mathrm{gauge}}$ is in the null space of the Hessian, so the first part of the statement is correct. However, the statement then claims that adding noise in these directions \"changes the physical state\". This is a direct contradiction of the definition of a gauge transformation. A perturbation along a gauge direction, by definition, does not change the physical state. Consequently, it cannot \"systematically reduce the energy\". A move along a gauge direction results in exactly zero change in energy. The problem setup also specifies that perturbations are in the *physical* tangent space, which is complementary to the gauge tangent space.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the constrained Hessian has nearly flat directions associated with very small curvatures that correlate with tiny Schmidt values on the adjacent bonds, then small random perturbations that populate these directions can, after re-orthonormalization in subsequent sweeps, unlock additional variational freedom on neighboring tensors and allow a transition into a lower-energy basin that was inaccessible without perturbation.**\nThis describes a sophisticated but very real mechanism in DMRG. A \"nearly flat direction\" (a direction with a very small positive eigenvalue of the Hessian) indicates a plateau in the local energy landscape. The algorithm can slow down or get stuck here. In MPS, such flat directions often correspond to changes in the tensor that have a tiny effect on the state's entanglement structure, which is encoded in the Schmidt values at the bonds. If certain Schmidt values are nearly zero, the corresponding entanglement modes are considered \"frozen out\", reducing the effective variational freedom of the MPS. Adding a small random perturbation can \"excite\" these modes by populating the corresponding flat directions in the local tensor space. When this perturbed tensor is updated and the orthogonality center is swept to the next site, the new Schmidt spectrum at the bond may become less sparse (i.e., the small Schmidt values might increase). This enriches the basis for the optimization problem at the *next* site. This \"unlocking\" of variational freedom can allow the global MPS state to navigate out of a region of the manifold corresponding to one energy basin and find a path towards a different, lower-energy basin. This is a primary justification for the \"noise\" or \"perturbation\" term used in modern DMRG implementations, especially for difficult problems.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. To probe the local curvature faithfully while preserving the normalization constraint to leading order, one should project the injected random perturbation onto the constrained tangent space orthogonal to $x_{\\star}$ and choose its amplitude small relative to a local energy scale, so that the second-order term governs the energy change; this justifies the practice of adding small noise to escape spurious minima without destabilizing well-conditioned minima.**\nThis statement correctly describes the proper protocol for applying a perturbation and the rationale behind it.\n1. A random vector $\\eta$ is generated, and its projection onto the tangent space at $x_{\\star}$ is computed as $\\delta x \\propto (I - x_{\\star}x_{\\star}^{\\dagger})\\eta$. This ensures $x_{\\star}^{\\dagger}\\delta x = 0$, so the normalization is maintained to first order, and the first-order term in the energy expansion vanishes.\n2. The perturbation's amplitude must be small ($||\\delta x|| \\ll 1$) for the second-order Taylor expansion $\\Delta E \\approx \\delta x^{\\dagger} (H_{\\mathrm{eff}} - E_{\\star} I) \\delta x$ to be a valid approximation. The local curvature analysis is based entirely on this approximation.\n3. This procedure allows the perturbation to be effective. If $x_{\\star}$ is a saddle point (negative curvature), $\\Delta E$ can be negative, leading to escape. If $x_{\\star}$ is a good local minimum (strong positive curvature), $\\Delta E$ will be positive but small. The subsequent optimization step will easily correct for this small uphill move. Thus, small noise selectively destabilizes \"bad\" stationary points (saddles, weak minima) while leaving \"good\" minima largely unaffected. This provides a clear theoretical justification for the practice.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{ADE}}$$", "id": "2885138"}]}
