Use only the following fundamental base: the imaginary-time Schrödinger equation for coefficient dynamics, the definition of a finite-difference time step, and the decomposition of Hamiltonian-driven population change into off-diagonal transfers (spawning) and diagonal shifts (death or cloning). Do not assume any unproven or unstated formula beyond these bases. \n\nSpecifically, let the vector of signed walker populations be denoted by $\\mathbf{w}(\\tau)$ and the Hamiltonian by the real symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ with entries $H_{IJ}$.

It is based on established principles of quantum mechanics and numerical analysis as applied in the field of quantum chemistry. All necessary data are provided, and the objective is unambiguous. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the imaginary-time Schrödinger equation governing the evolution of the wavefunction coefficients, $\\mathbf{c}(\\tau)$, in a discrete basis of determinants:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{c}}{\\partial \\tau} = -(\\mathbf{H} - S \\mathbf{I}) \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{H}$ is the Hamiltonian matrix, $S$ is a scalar energy shift, $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, and $\\tau$ is imaginary time.

The problem asks for the deterministic update corresponding to the *expected* evolution of this walker population over a single, discrete time step $\\Delta \\tau$. In this context of expectation, we can directly work with the evolution equation for the coefficients, treating $w_I$ as equivalent to $c_I$.\n\nLet us write the equation for a single component, $c_I$:\n$$\n\\frac{d c_I}{d \\tau} = - \\sum_{J} (\\mathbf{H} - S \\mathbf{I})_{IJ} c_J(\\tau)\n$$\nThe matrix elements are $(\\mathbf{H} - S \\mathbf{I})_{IJ} = H_{IJ} - S \\delta_{IJ}$, where $\\delta_{IJ}$ is the Kronecker delta. We can expand the summation and separate it into a diagonal term ($J=I$) and off-diagonal terms ($J \\neq I$):\n$$\n\\frac{d c_I}{d \\tau} = - \\left( (H_{II} - S) c_I(\\tau) + \\sum_{J \\neq I} H_{IJ} c_J(\\tau) \\right)\n$$\nTo discretize this continuous evolution, we employ a first-order forward Euler approximation for the time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d c_I}{d \\tau} \\approx \\frac{c_I(\\tau + \\Delta \\tau) - c_I(\\tau)}{\\Delta \\tau}\n$$\nSubstituting this finite-difference approximation into our differential equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{c_I(\\tau + \\Delta \\tau) - c_I(\\tau)}{\\Delta \\tau} = - (H_{II} - S) c_I(\\tau) - \\sum_{J \\neq I} H_{IJ} c_J(\\tau)\n$$\nWe now solve for the coefficient at the next time step, $c_I(\\tau + \\Delta \\tau)$:\n$$\nc_I(\\tau + \\Delta \\tau) = c_I(\\tau) - \\Delta \\tau (H_{II} - S) c_I(\\tau) - \\Delta \\tau \\sum_{J \\neq I} H_{IJ} c_J(\\tau)\n$$\nThis expression provides the deterministic update for the expected walker population on determinant $I$. As requested, we can identify the distinct contributions to this update:\n1. The initial population: $w_I(\\tau)$, which is equivalent to $c_I(\\tau)$.\n2. The expected diagonal contribution (death or cloning): The term $- \\Delta \\tau (H_{II} - S) w_I(\\tau)$. This changes the population at determinant $I$ based on its diagonal energy $H_{II}$, the shift $S$, and its current population $w_I(\\tau)$.\n3.
