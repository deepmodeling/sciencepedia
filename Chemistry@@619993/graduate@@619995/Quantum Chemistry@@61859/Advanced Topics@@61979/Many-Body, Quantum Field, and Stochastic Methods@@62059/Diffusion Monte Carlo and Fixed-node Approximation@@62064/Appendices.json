Consider the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian in atomic units, where the reduced Planck constant and the electron mass are set to unity. The Hamiltonian is $H = -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\tfrac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\omega^2 x^2$ with frequency parameter $\\omega \\gt 0$. The imaginary-time evolution operator is $e^{-\\tau H}$ with imaginary time $\\tau \\ge 0$, and the corresponding imaginary-time propagator (Euclidean kernel) $K(x,x';\\tau)$ is defined by $\\psi(x,\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(x,x';\\tau)\\,\\psi(x',0)\\,dx'$.\n\nYour tasks are as follows, starting from fundamental laws and core definitions:\n\n- Begin with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the spectral decomposition of $H$. Using the known harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions and eigenvalues (well-tested facts), derive the exact imaginary-time propagator $K(x,x';\\tau)$ as the sum $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\psi_n(x)\\psi_n(x') e^{-\\tau E_n}$ and then perform the summation to obtain the closed-form kernel in terms of hyperbolic functions. Do not assume the kernel’s final form; derive it from the spectral representation and the generating function for Hermite polynomials.\n\n- Explain why, for any square-integrable initial function $\\psi(x,0)$ that is not orthogonal to the ground state, the projection $\\psi(x,\\tau) = \\left(e^{-\\tau H}\\psi\\right)(x)$ converges to the ground state as $\\tau \\to \\infty$. Connect this to the principle used in Diffusion Monte Carlo. Then explain the fixed-node constraint in DMC as a boundary condition enforcing a chosen nodal surface. In the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, imposing an odd-parity subspace (a node at $x=0$) is an exact fixed-node constraint for accessing the first excited state.\n\n- Implement a numerical illustration that applies the exact imaginary-time propagator to specified initial functions and measures convergence. Discretize space on a uniform grid and approximate integrals by the trapezoidal rule. Normalize wavefunctions using the $L^2$ norm on the discrete grid.\n\n- Use atomic units throughout. No physical units need to be reported for the final numerical answers. Angles are not used. All reported numbers must be rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite and required outputs:\n\nWork with the following fixed parameters and definitions.\n\n- Frequency: $\\omega = 1$.\n\n- Spatial grid: $x \\in [-L,L]$ with $L = \\tfrac{6}{\\sqrt{\\omega}}$. Use $N = 1201$ uniformly spaced points, so that the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = \\tfrac{2L}{N-1}$.\n\n- Exact reference eigenfunctions on the grid (normalized to unity on the grid via discrete normalization):\n  - Ground state: $\\psi_0(x) = \\left(\\tfrac{\\omega}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/4} e^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\omega x^2}$.\n  - First excited state: $\\psi_1(x) = \\sqrt{2\\omega}\\,x\\,\\psi_0(x)$.\n  - Exact energies: $E_0 = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\omega$ and $E_1 = \\tfrac{3}{2}\\omega$.\n\n- Initial functions:\n  - Generic initial function (no fixed node): $\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}(x) = e^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}(x-1)^2} + 0.6\\,e^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}(x+1.5)^2}$.\n  - Nodal-constrained initial function (odd parity; exact fixed-node for the first excited state): $\\psi_{\\mathrm{n}}(x) = x\\,e^{-x^2}$.\n\n- Propagation by the exact kernel $K(x,x';\\tau)$ to obtain $\\psi(x,\\tau) = \\int K(x,x';\\tau)\\,\\psi(x',0)\\,dx'$, discretized by the trapezoidal rule. After propagation, normalize $\\psi(x,\\tau)$ to unit $L^2$ norm on the grid. For the nodal-constrained case, note that the odd initial function remains odd under propagation by the even kernel, thereby preserving the node at $x=0$; no additional enforcement is required.\n\n- Energy estimator: For a normalized real wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ on the grid, compute an energy estimate\n  $$\n  E[\\psi] \\approx \\frac{\\int \\left[\\tfrac{1}{2} \\left(\\tfrac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\omega^2 x^2 \\psi(x)^2\\right] dx}{\\int \\psi(x)^2 dx},\n  $$\n  where the derivative is approximated by central differences and the integrals by the trapezoidal rule.\n\nCompute the following six quantities and output them as a single list in the specified order, with each entry rounded to six decimal places:\n\n1. $L^2$ error to the ground state after projection of $\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}$ with $\\tau = 0.25$:\n   $$\n   \\left\\|\\psi(\\cdot,\\tau) - \\psi_0(\\cdot)\\right\\|_2 \\equiv \\left(\\int \\left[\\psi(x,\\tau) - \\psi_0(x)\\right]^2 dx\\right)^{1/2}.\n   $$\n\n2. $L^2$ error to the ground state after projection of $\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}$ with $\\tau = 1.0$.\n\n3. $L^2$ error to the ground state after projection of $\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}$ with $\\tau = 3.0$.\n\n4.

No other text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics, is mathematically well-posed, and is stated objectively with all necessary parameters and definitions provided. We will proceed with the derivation and computation as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the exact imaginary-time propagator for the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian in atomic units ($m=1$, $\\hbar=1$) is given by $H = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 x^2$. The imaginary-time propagator, or kernel $K(x,x';\\tau)$, evolves a wavefunction $\\psi(x,0)$ in imaginary time $\\tau \\ge 0$ according to $\\psi(x,\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(x,x';\\tau)\\,\\psi(x',0)\\,dx'$. The kernel can be expressed via a spectral decomposition over the complete set of eigenstates $\\{\\psi_n(x)\\}$ and eigenvalues $\\{E_n\\}$ of the Hamiltonian $H$:\n$$\nK(x,x';\\tau) = \\langle x| e^{-\\tau H} |x' \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\langle x|e^{-\\tau H}|\\psi_n\\rangle\\langle\\psi_n|x'\\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\psi_n(x)\\psi_n^*(x') e^{-\\tau E_n}\n$$\nFor the harmonic oscillator, the eigenfunctions are real, so $\\psi_n^*(x') = \\psi_n(x')$. The eigenvalues are $E_n = \\omega(n + \\frac{1}{2})$ and the normalized eigenfunctions are $\\psi_n(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega/\\pi}}{2^n n!}\\right)^{1/2} H_n(\\sqrt{\\omega}x) e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega x^2}$, where $H_n(y)$ are the physicist's Hermite polynomials. Substituting these into the sum gives:\n$$\nK(x,x';\\tau) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega/\\pi}}{2^n n!}\\right)^{1/2} H_n(\\sqrt{\\omega}x) e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega x^2}\\right] \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega/\\pi}}{2^n n!}\\right)^{1/2} H_n(\\sqrt{\\omega}x') e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega x'^2}\\right] e^{-\\omega(n+1/2)\\tau}\n$$\nLet us define the dimensionless coordinates $y = \\sqrt{\\omega}x$ and $y' = \\sqrt{\\omega}x'$, and let $z = e^{-\\omega\\tau}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nK(x,x';\\tau) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{H_n(y) H_n(y')}{2^n n!} z^n\n$$\nThe summation is a known identity known as Mehler's formula for Hermite polynomials:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{H_n(y) H_n(y')}{2^n n!} z^n = (1-z^2)^{-1/2} \\exp\\left[\\frac{2yy'z - (y^2+y'^2)z^2}{1-z^2}\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the kernel:\n$$\nK(x,x';\\tau) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)} (1-z^2)^{-1/2} \\exp\\left[\\frac{2yy'z - (y^2+y'^2)z^2}{1-z^2}\\right]\n$$\nWe combine the exponential terms. The argument of the total exponential becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2) + \\frac{2yy'z - (y^2+y'^2)z^2}{1-z^2} = -\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)(1-z^2) + 2yy'z - (y^2+y'^2)z^2}{1-z^2}\n$$\n$$\n= -\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)(1+z^2) + 2yy'z}{1-z^2}\n$$\nNow, we express $z=e^{-\\omega\\tau}$ in terms of hyperbolic functions: $1-z^2 = 1 - e^{-2\\omega\\tau} = 2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)$, and $1+z^2 = 1 + e^{-2\\omega\\tau} = 2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\cosh(\\omega\\tau)$. The pre-factor becomes $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\pi(1-z^2)}} e^{-\\omega\\tau/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi \\sinh(\\omega\\tau)}}$. The exponent becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2) 2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\cosh(\\omega\\tau) + 2yy'e^{-\\omega\\tau}}{2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)} = -\\frac{\\omega\\tau}{2} - \\frac{(y^2+y'^2)\\cosh(\\omega\\tau) - 2yy'}{2\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)}\n$$\nThis seems overly complicated. Let us use an alternative simplification route on the exponent which leads to the final form more directly. Let's combine the argument of the exponent from Mehler's formula with the $e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)}$ term:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{2yy'z - (y^2+y'^2)z^2}{1-z^2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)(1-z^2) + 2yy'z - (y^2+y'^2)z^2}{1-z^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2) - \\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)z^2 + 2yy'z}{1-z^2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}(y^2+y'^2)(1+z^2)+2yy'z}{1-z^2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $y=\\sqrt{\\omega}x$, $y'=\\sqrt{\\omega}x'$, $z=e^{-\\omega\\tau}$, $1-z^2=e^{-\\omega\\tau}(e^{\\omega\\tau}-e^{-\\omega\\tau})=2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)$, and $1+z^2=2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\cosh(\\omega\\tau)$, the exponent becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}\\omega(x^2+x'^2)(2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\cosh(\\omega\\tau))+2\\omega xx'e^{-\\omega\\tau}}{2e^{-\\omega\\tau}\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)} = -\\frac{\\omega}{2\\sinh(\\omega\\tau)}\\left[(x^2+x'^2)\\cosh(\\omega\\tau) - 2xx'\\right]\n$$\nCombining with the pre-factor $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi \\sinh(\\omega\\tau)}}$, we arrive at the closed-form propagator:\n$$\nK(x,x';\\tau) = \\left[\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi \\sinh(\\omega\\tau)}\\right]^{1/2} \\exp\\left\\{ -\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\sinh(\\omega\\tau)} \\left[ (x^2+x'^2)\\cosh(\\omega\\tau) - 2xx' \\right] \\right\\}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we address the principle of ground-state projection. Any square-integrable initial state $\\psi(x,0)$ can be expanded in the eigenbasis of $H$: $\\psi(x,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n \\psi_n(x)$, where $c_n = \\int \\psi_n(x)\\psi(x,0)dx$. Applying the imaginary-time evolution operator gives:\n$$\n\\psi(x,\\tau) = e^{-\\tau H} \\psi(x,0) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n e^{-\\tau E_n} \\psi_n(x) = e^{-\\tau E_0}\\left[c_0\\psi_0(x) + c_1 e^{-\\tau(E_1-E_0)}\\psi_1(x) + \\dots\\right]\n$$\nSince the energy eigenvalues are ordered $E_0 < E_1 < E_2 < \\dots$, the exponents $(E_n - E_0)$ for $n>0$ are strictly positive. As $\\tau \\to \\infty$, all terms $e^{-\\tau(E_n-E_0)}$ decay to zero, leaving only the $n=0$ term. Thus, for any initial state not orthogonal to the ground state (i.e., $c_0 \\neq 0$), the propagated wavefunction converges to the ground state: $\\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty} \\psi(x,\\tau) \\propto \\psi_0(x)$. Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a stochastic method that simulates this process. The Schrödinger equation in imaginary time is analogous to a diffusion-reaction equation, where the wavefunction is represented by a population of \"walkers.\" These walkers diffuse (due to the kinetic energy term) and are created or destroyed (due to the potential energy term). Over long imaginary time, the distribution of walkers converges to a sample of the ground state wavefunction. For fermionic systems, the wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which implies it must have nodes (surfaces where $\\psi=0$). Standard DMC cannot handle these nodes correctly, which leads to the \"fermion sign problem.\" The fixed-node approximation resolves this by imposing the nodes of a guiding trial wavefunction as an infinite potential barrier. Any walker attempting to cross a node is removed. This procedure finds the lowest-energy state compatible with the imposed nodal structure. For the 1D harmonic oscillator, the true ground state $\\psi_0$ is nodeless. The first excited state $\\psi_1$ has a node at $x=0$. By constraining the system to odd-parity functions (all of which have a node at $x=0$), the imaginary-time projection will converge to the lowest-energy odd state, which is $\\psi_1$. This is an instance of an *exact* fixed-node calculation.\n\nFinally, the numerical implementation discretizes the problem. Space is represented by a uniform grid of $N=1201$ points in the interval $x \\in [-L, L]$, where $L=6.0$. The propagation integral $\\psi(x_i, \\tau) = \\int K(x_i,x';\\tau)\\psi(x',0)dx'$ is numerically evaluated using the trapezoidal rule, which can be expressed as a matrix-vector operation on the discretized wavefunctions and the kernel matrix $K_{ij}=K(x_i,x_j;\\tau)$. After each propagation step, the resulting wavefunction is normalized on the grid such that $\\int |\\psi(x,\\tau)|^2 dx \\approx \\sum_i |\\psi(x_i,\\tau)|^2 \\Delta x = 1.0$. The energy is estimated using the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, with the kinetic energy term $\\int \\psi (-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2) \\psi dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\int (\\nabla \\psi)^2 dx$ calculated using central differences for the derivative $\\nabla\\psi$ and the trapezoidal rule for the integral. This setup allows for a direct numerical test of the theoretical principles.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quantum harmonic oscillator problem using the exact imaginary-time propagator.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Fixed parameters from the problem statement\n    omega = 1.0\n    L = 6.0 / np.sqrt(omega)\n    N = 1201\n    \n    # Exact energies for reference\n    E0_exact = 0.5 * omega\n    E1_exact = 1.5 * omega\n\n    # Discretize the spatial domain\n    x_grid = np.linspace(-L, L, N)\n    dx = (2 * L) / (N - 1)\n\n    # --- Helper functions ---\n    \n    def normalize(psi, dx_val):\n        \"\"\"Normalizes a wavefunction on the grid using the trapezoidal rule for the L2 norm.\"\"\"\n        norm_sq = np.trapz(psi**2, dx=dx_val)\n        return psi / np.sqrt(norm_sq)\n\n    def l2_error(psi_a, psi_b, dx_val):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the L2 error between two wavefunctions on the grid.\"\"\"\n        return np.sqrt(np.trapz((psi_a - psi_b)**2, dx=dx_val))\n\n    def calculate_energy(psi, x_vals, dx_val, omega_val):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the energy expectation value for a normalized wavefunction.\"\"\"\n        # Use central differences for the derivative\n        dpsi_dx = np.gradient(psi, dx_val)\n        \n        # Kinetic and potential energy integrands\n        kinetic_integrand = 0.5 * dpsi_dx**2\n        potential_integrand = 0.5 * (omega_val**2) * (x_vals**2) * (psi**2)\n        \n        # Calculate total energy using trapezoidal rule\n        energy = np.trapz(kinetic_integrand + potential_integrand, dx=dx_val)\n        return energy\n        \n    def get_propagator_matrix(tau, x_vals, omega_val):\n        \"\"\"Computes the exact propagator matrix K(x_i, x_j;

The calculation must be performed for several deformations of the nodal surface, followed by a sensitivity analysis of the energy with respect to the deformation parameters.\n\nThe system is described by the two-particle Hamiltonian in atomic units ($\\hbar = 1$, $m=1$):\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_1^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_2^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2\\left(x_1^2 + x_2^2\\right)\n$$\nWith the specified angular frequency $\\omega=1$, the potential energy is $V(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$. The problem is to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, $\\hat{H}\\Psi(x_1, x_2) = E\\Psi(x_1, x_2)$, under the fixed-node constraint.\n\nThe fixed-node approximation imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions, $\\Psi=0$, on a prescribed nodal surface. Here, the nodal surface is defined by the zero level-set of the function:\n$$\ng_{\\theta,\\kappa}(x_1,x_2) = (x_1 - x_2) + \\theta(x_1 + x_2) + \\kappa\\,\\frac{x_1^2 - x_2^2}{L} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ and $\\kappa$ are deformation parameters. The solution is sought within one of the nodal cells, specifically where $g_{\\theta,\\kappa}(x_1,x_2) > 0$. The fixed-node energy, $E_{\\mathrm{FN}}(\\theta, \\kappa)$, is the lowest eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian within this domain.\n\nTo solve this problem numerically, we employ the finite-difference method. The continuous two-dimensional space $(x_1, x_2)$ is discretized into a uniform grid over the square domain $[-L, L] \\times [-L, L]$. Given $N=41$ points per dimension and a half-width $L=4$, the grid spacing is $h = \\frac{2L}{N-1} = \\frac{8}{40} = 0.2$. The grid points are $(x_{1,i}, x_{2,j})$ where $x_{1,i} = -L + i \\cdot h$ and $x_{2,j} = -L + j \\cdot h$ for $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n\nThe Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_1^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_2^2}$ is approximated at each grid point using the standard five-point stencil:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\Psi_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{\\Psi_{i+1,j} + \\Psi_{i-1,j} + \\Psi_{i,j+1} + \\Psi_{i,j-1} - 4\\Psi_{i,j}}{h^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we obtain a discretized eigenvalue problem, which can be represented in matrix form as $H_{\\text{matrix}} \\vec{\\Psi} = E \\vec{\\Psi}$. The vector $\\vec{\\Psi}$ contains the values of the wavefunction at the grid points that lie inside the specified nodal cell.\n\nThe construction of the Hamiltonian matrix $H_{\\text{matrix}}$ proceeds as follows. First, we identify all \"active\" grid points $(i, j)$ for which $g_{\\theta,\\kappa}(x_{1,i}, x_{2,j}) > 0$. Let the number of such points be $N_{\\text{active}}$. We create a mapping from the 2D grid indices $(i, j)$ of active points to a 1D index $p \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_{\\text{active}}-1\\}$. The matrix $H_{\\text{matrix}}$ will have dimensions $N_{\\text{active}} \\times N_{\\text{active}}$.\n\nThe elements of $H_{\\text{matrix}}$, denoted $H_{pq}$, are determined by the discretized Hamiltonian. For a given active point $p$ corresponding to grid location $(i,j)$:\nThe diagonal element $H_{pp}$ is given by:\n$$\nH_{pp} = -\\frac{1}{2h^2}(-4) + V(x_{1,i}, x_{2,j}) = \\frac{2}{h^2} + \\frac{1}{2}(x_{1,i}^2 + x_{2,j}^2)\n$$\nThe off-diagonal element $H_{pq}$ is non-zero only if point $q$ corresponds to a direct neighbor of point $p$ on the grid. If point $q$ corresponds to neighbor $(i', j')$ of $(i, j)$, the element is:\n$$\nH_{pq} = -\\frac{1}{2h^2}\n$$\nThis construction is performed for all active points. If a neighbor of an active point is not active (i.e., it lies on or outside the nodal surface, or outside the box boundary $|x_k| \\le L$), it is subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition $\\Psi=0$. Consequently, no matrix element is generated for this neighbor, correctly implementing the boundary condition. The resulting matrix is a sparse, real, and symmetric matrix.\n\nThe fixed-node energy $E_{\\mathrm{FN}}(\\theta, \\kappa)$ is the smallest algebraic eigenvalue of this matrix. We use a numerical eigensolver, specifically `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`, which is designed for large, sparse, Hermitian matrices, to find this lowest eigenvalue.\n\nThe entire process is encapsulated in a function that takes $(\\theta, \\kappa)$ as input and returns $E_{\\mathrm{FN}}$. This function is then used to compute the energies for the nine specified test cases.\n\nFinally, we perform a local sensitivity analysis by computing the $2 \\times 2$ Hessian matrix of the energy, $H$, at the exact node $(\\theta, \\kappa) = (0, 0)$. The second-order derivatives are approximated using centered finite-difference formulas with step sizes $\\delta_\\theta = 0.08$ and $\\delta_\\kappa = 0.10$.\nThe diagonal elements are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\approx \\frac{E(\\delta_\\theta,0) - 2E(0,0) + E(-\\delta_\\theta,0)}{\\delta_\\theta^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\kappa^2} \\approx \\frac{E(0,\\delta_\\kappa) - 2E(0,0) + E(0,-\\delta_\\kappa)}{\\delta_\\kappa^2}\n$$\nThe mixed partial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial \\theta \\partial \\kappa} \\approx \\frac{E(\\delta_\\theta,\\delta_\\kappa) - E(\\delta_\\theta,-\\delta_\\kappa) - E(-\\delta_\\theta,\\delta_\\kappa) + E(-\\delta_\\theta,-\\delta_\\kappa)}{4\\,\\delta_\\theta\\,\\delta_\\kappa}\n$$\nTo compute these, we need to evaluate the energy at nine points around $(0,0)$. After assembling the Hessian matrix $H$, we compute its eigenvalues and the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The eigenvalues are sorted in descending order, and the eigenvector $(v_\\theta, v_\\kappa)$ is normalized and its sign is fixed by the convention $v_\\theta \\ge 0$. These results quantify how the energy changes with small deformations of the nodal surface. The largest eigenvalue of the Hessian indicates the direction in the $(\\theta, \\kappa)$ space along which the energy is most sensitive to nodal deformations.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import eigsh\n\n# Define global parameters for the simulation\nL = 4.0\nN = 41\nOMEGA = 1.0\n\n# Define Hessian calculation parameters\nD_THETA = 0.08\nD_KAPPA = 0.10\n\ndef compute_energy(theta, kappa, memo):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the fixed-node ground state energy for given nodal parameters.\n    It uses a finite-difference discretization of the Hamiltonian.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check cache first to avoid re-computation\n    if (theta, kappa) in memo:\n        return memo[(theta, kappa)]\n\n    h = 2 * L / (N -

Consequently, the central statistical task is to estimate an unbiased standard error of the sample mean from correlated observations.\n\nStart from the following foundational base:\n- The sample mean of a stationary time series with finite integrated autocorrelation time obeys a central limit theorem for Markov chains: the scaled deviation of the sample mean tends to a normal distribution as the number of samples grows, and the variance of the sample mean depends on the autocorrelation function.\n- An autoregressive process of order one (AR(1)) with stationary mean and variance is a well-tested model for exponentially decaying time correlations.\n\nYour program must:\n- Generate synthetic DMC-like local-energy traces using an AR(1) Gaussian process with specified parameters.\n- Compute the naive standard error of the mean that ignores correlations.\n- Compute a blocked standard error using binary blocking (also called reblocking), which coarse-grains the series by contiguous averaging with block sizes that are powers of two, and chooses the largest block size subject to a minimum number of blocks constraint, thereby reducing the bias from time correlations.\n\nFormally, let the synthetic local-energy time series be defined by an AR(1) recursion\n$$\nX_{t} = \\mu + \\rho \\left( X_{t-1} - \\mu \\right) + \\varepsilon_{t}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left(0, \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}\\right),\n$$\ninitialized in its stationary distribution with\n$$\nX_{0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left(\\mu, \\sigma^{2}\\right), \\quad \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2} = \\sigma^{2}\\left(1-\\rho^{2}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $t \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,N-1\\}$, $N$ is the total number of samples, $\\mu$ is the fixed-node energy offset (a constant mean), $\\sigma$ is the stationary standard deviation of the local energy, and $\\rho \\in (-1,1)$ controls the correlation strength.\n\nGiven a realization $\\{X_{t}\\}_{t=0}^{N-1}$:\n- The naive standard error is the sample standard deviation divided by $\\sqrt{N}$, where the sample variance uses the unbiased divisor.\n- For blocking, define block sizes $b \\in \\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, 2^{2}, \\dots\\}$ and, for each block size $b$, form $n_{b} = \\lfloor N/b \\rfloor$ contiguous blocks of size $b$, take their means, and compute the sample variance of these block means (with unbiased divisor).

The use of a first-order autoregressive, or AR($1$), process to model the local energy fluctuations from a Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculation is a standard and physically justified approximation. The objective is to correctly estimate the statistical uncertainty of the mean energy in the presence of temporal correlations. This requires moving beyond naive statistical estimators that assume independent data.\n\nValidation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, mathematically well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed. It is neither trivial nor ill-posed. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution will be developed in three stages, following the principles of statistical mechanics and time-series analysis.\n\nFirst, we must generate the synthetic data. The local-energy time series, denoted by a sequence of random variables $\\{X_t\\}_{t=0}^{N-1}$, is modeled as a stationary Gaussian AR($1$) process. Its evolution is given by the recursion relation:\n$$\nX_{t} = \\mu + \\rho \\left( X_{t-1} - \\mu \\right) + \\varepsilon_{t}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the constant mean energy, $\\rho$ is the autocorrelation coefficient between successive steps, and $\\varepsilon_t$ are independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise terms with mean zero and variance $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2$. To ensure the process is stationary with a constant variance $\\sigma^2 = \\text{Var}(X_t)$, the noise variance must be set to $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2 = \\sigma^2(1-\\rho^2)$. The simulation begins by drawing the initial state $X_0$ from the stationary distribution itself, which is a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, i.e., $X_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. Subsequent points $X_t$ for $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N-1\\}$ are generated via the recursion. This procedure guarantees that the entire generated series is a true sample from the specified stationary process.\n\nSecond, we compute the naive standard error of the mean. This estimator is predicated on the false assumption that the $N$ data points are uncorrelated. It is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{naive}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}}\n$$\nwhere $s^2$ is the unbiased sample variance of the time series $\\{X_t\\}$:\n$$\ns^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{t=0}^{N-1} (X_t - \\bar{X})^2\n$$\nHere, $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean of the series. For any positive correlation ($\\rho > 0$), this estimator will systematically underestimate the true uncertainty.\n\nThird, we implement the blocking method, a robust technique to account for serial correlation. The core principle is to coarse-grain the data into blocks that are sufficiently large such that the block averages are approximately uncorrelated. For a chosen block size $b$, the original series is partitioned into $n_b = \\lfloor N/b \\rfloor$ non-overlapping blocks. The mean of each block is computed, yielding a new, shorter time series of $n_b$ block averages.\nThe variance of the grand mean can then be estimated from the sample variance of these block means. The standard error for a given block size $b$ is:\n$$\n\\text{SE}_{\\text{blocked}}(b) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{var}(\\text{block means})}{n_b}}\n$$\nwhere $\\text{var}(\\text{block means})$ is the unbiased sample variance of the $n_b$ block averages. As the block size $b$ increases, the block means become less correlated, and $\\text{SE}_{\\text{blocked}}(b)$ converges towards the true standard error of the mean. However, as $b$ increases, $n_b$ decreases, leading to a poorer statistical estimate of the variance. We must therefore select an optimal block size, $b^{\\star}$. The problem specifies a practical criterion: $b^{\\star}$ is the largest block size of the form $2^k$ for integer $k \\ge 0$ such that the number of blocks $n_{b^{\\star}}$ is at least a specified minimum, $B_{\\min}$. This procedure provides a balance between reducing bias from correlation and maintaining statistical stability.\n\nFinally, we calculate two derived quantities to characterize the impact of correlation. The ratio of the naive to the blocked standard error, $\\text{SE}_{\\text{naive}} / \\text{SE}_{\\text{blocked}}(b^{\\star})$, quantifies the degree of underestimation by the naive formula. The effective sample size, defined as:\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{s^2}{(\\text{SE}_{\\text{blocked}}(b^{\\star}))^2}\n$$\nrepresents the number of independent samples that would yield an equivalent statistical error. For positively correlated data, we expect $N_{\\text{eff}} < N$.\n\nThe implementation will execute this complete procedure for each parameter set provided in the test suite, ensuring deterministic output by using the specified pseudorandom number generator seeds.
