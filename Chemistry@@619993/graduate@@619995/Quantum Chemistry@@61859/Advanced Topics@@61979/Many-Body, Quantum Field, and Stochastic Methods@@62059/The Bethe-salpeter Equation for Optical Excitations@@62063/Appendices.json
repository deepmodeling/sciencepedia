It is a standard pedagogical problem in the study of optical excitations using many-body perturbation theory. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for neutral excitations in the resonant ($R$) and antiresonant ($AR$) basis is a generalized eigenvalue problem of the form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A  B \\\\ B^{*}  A^{*} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\end{pmatrix} = E \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{1}  \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}  -\\mathbf{1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $A$ and $B$ are the resonant-resonant and resonant-antiresonant blocks of the BSE kernel, respectively. $X$ and $Y$ are the resonant and antiresonant components of the exciton eigenvector, and $E$ is the excitation energy.
