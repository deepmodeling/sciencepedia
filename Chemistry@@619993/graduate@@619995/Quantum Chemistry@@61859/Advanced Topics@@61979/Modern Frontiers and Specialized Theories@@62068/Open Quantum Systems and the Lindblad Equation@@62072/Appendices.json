The qubit is weakly coupled to a broadband zero-temperature environment that induces amplitude damping (spontaneous emission).

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the theory of open quantum systems, based on established principles of quantum mechanics and the Lindblad master equation formalism. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions or logical flaws. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the adjoint Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation for an observable $A(t)$ in the Heisenberg picture:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) \\;=\\; \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H, A(t)] \\;+\\; \\sum_{k}\\Big(L_{k}^{\\dagger}\\,A(t)\\,L_{k} \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\{L_{k}^{\\dagger}L_{k},\\,A(t)\\}\\Big)\n$$\nWe are interested in the observable $A = \\sigma_{z}$.

Thus, the unitary part of the evolution for $\\sigma_{z}$ is zero. This is expected, as the Hamiltonian describes a precession around the $z$-axis, which leaves the $z$-component of the spin invariant.\n\nThe equation of motion for the operator $\\sigma_{z}(t)$ simplifies to only the dissipative part (the Lindbladian):\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\sigma_{z}(t) = L^{\\dagger}\\sigma_{z}(t)L - \\frac{1}{2}\\{L^{\\dagger}L, \\sigma_{z}(t)\\}\n$$\nWe substitute $L = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\sigma_{-}$ and its adjoint $L^{\\dagger} = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\sigma_{+}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\sigma_{z} = (\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\sigma_{+})\\,\\sigma_{z}\\,(\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\sigma_{-}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\{(\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\sigma_{+})(\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\\sigma_{-}), \\sigma_{z}\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\sigma_{z} = \\gamma\\,\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{z}\\sigma_{-} - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\{\\sigma_{+}\\sigma_{-}, \\sigma_{z}\\}\n$$\nWe now employ the standard algebra of Pauli ladder operators.

Immediately following this, it demands numerical values for these times in units of seconds. Providing numerical results is impossible as no numerical values are given for the rates.

However, the core scientific task is well-posed and fundamental. A competent physicist corrects a flawed problem rather than abandoning it. Therefore, I will proceed by disregarding the illogical request for numerical answers and solve the substantive part of the problem: the symbolic derivation of the relaxation times. It is assumed that the rates $\\gamma_{1}$, $\\gamma_{\\phi}$, and $\\sigma$ possess units of inverse time (e.g., $\\text{s}^{-1}$), such that the derived times $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$, and $T_{2}^{\\ast}$ will correctly have units of time (e.g., seconds).\n\nThe state of the two-level system is described by the density operator $\\rho$, which in the basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |0\\rangle\\}$ is represented by the matrix $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{11} & \\rho_{10} \\\\ \\rho_{01} & \\rho_{00} \\end{pmatrix}$.

The matrix $C$ is constructed from the coefficients of the Lindblad operators $L_k$ when they are expanded in the operator basis $\\{F_m\\}$. Let this expansion be $L_k = \\sum_m a_{km} F_m$. The elements of the Kossakowski matrix are then given by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nC_{mn} = \\sum_k a_{km} a_{kn}^*\n$$\nThe problem provides a set of three Lindblad operators, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$, and an orthonormal basis of three operators, $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$. We must first determine the coefficients $a_{km}$ for $k,m \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe given Lindblad operators are:\n$L_1 = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,F_1$\n$L_2 = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,(\\cos\\theta\\,F_1 + \\sin\\theta\\,F_2)$\n$L_3 = \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,F_3$\n\nBy comparing these with the expansion $L_k = \\sum_{m=1}^3 a_{km} F_m$, we identify the coefficients $a_{km}$.\nFor $k=1$: $a_{11} = \\sqrt{\\gamma}$, $a_{12} = 0$, $a_{13} = 0$.\nFor $k=2$: $a_{21} = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\cos\\theta$, $a_{22} = \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\sin\\theta$, $a_{23} = 0$.\nFor $k=3$: $a_{31} = 0$, $a_{32} = 0$, $a_{33} = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$.\n\nAll coefficients $a_{km}$ are real, so $a_{kn}^* = a_{kn}$. We now compute the elements $C_{mn} = \\sum_{k=1}^3 a_{km} a_{kn}$ of the $3 \\times 3$ Kossakowski matrix $C$.\n\n$C_{11} = a_{11}^2 + a_{21}^2 + a_{31}^2 = (\\sqrt{\\gamma})^2 + (\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\cos\\theta)^2 + 0^2 = \\gamma(1+\\cos^2\\theta)$.\n$C_{12} = a_{11}a_{12} + a_{21}a_{22} + a_{31}a_{32} = (\\sqrt{\\gamma})(0) + (\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\cos\\theta)(\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\sin\\theta) + 0 = \\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$.\n$C_{13} = a_{11}a_{13} + a_{21}a_{23} + a_{31}a_{33} = 0$.\n$C_{21} = C_{12} = \\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$.\n$C_{22} = a_{12}^2 + a_{22}^2 + a_{32}^2 = 0^2 + (\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\sin\\theta)^2 + 0^2 = \\gamma\\sin^2\\theta$.\n$C_{23} = a_{12}a_{13} + a_{22}a_{23} + a_{32}a_{33} = 0$.\n$C_{31} = C_{13} = 0$.\n$C_{32} = C_{23} = 0$.\n$C_{33} = a_{13}^2 + a_{23}^2 + a_{33}^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + (\\sqrt{\\lambda})^2 = \\lambda$.\n\nThe resulting Kossakowski matrix is:\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma(1+\\cos^2\\theta) & \\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\\n\\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta & \\gamma\\sin^2\\theta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition of complete positivity requires that all eigenvalues of $C$ be non-negative. The matrix $C$ is block-diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of its diagonal blocks. One eigenvalue is immediately apparent from the $1 \\times 1$ block: $\\mu_1 = \\lambda$.\n\nThe other two eigenvalues are found from the upper-left $2 \\times 2$ block:\n$$\nC' = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma(1+\\cos^2\\theta) & \\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta & \\gamma\\sin^2\\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $C'$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(C' - \\mu I) = 0$.\nThe trace is $\\operatorname{Tr}(C') = \\gamma(1+\\cos^2\\theta) + \\gamma\\sin^2\\theta = \\gamma(1+1) = 2\\gamma$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(C') = \\gamma(1+\\cos^2\\theta) \\cdot \\gamma\\sin^2\\theta - (\\gamma\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta)^2 = \\gamma^2(\\sin^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta) - \\gamma^2\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta = \\gamma^2\\sin^2\\theta$.\nThe characteristic equation is $\\mu^2 - (\\operatorname{Tr}(C'))\\mu + \\det(C') = 0$, which is $\\mu^2 - 2\\gamma\\mu + \\gamma^2\\sin^2\\theta = 0$.\nSolving this quadratic equation for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{2\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\gamma)^2 - 4(1)(\\gamma^2\\sin^2\\theta)}}{2} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{4\\gamma^2(1-\\sin^2\\theta)}}{2} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\pm 2\\gamma\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta}}{2} = \\gamma(1 \\pm |\\cos\\theta|)\n$$\nSo, the three eigenvalues of the full Kossakowski matrix $C$ are $\\mu_1 = \\lambda$, $\\mu_2 = \\gamma(1 + |\\cos\\theta|)$, and $\\mu_3 = \\gamma(1 - |\\cos\\theta|)$. Since $\\gamma \\ge 0$, $\\lambda \\ge 0$, and $|\\cos\\theta| \\le 1$, all three eigenvalues are non-negative for any valid parameters. Thus, the generator is always completely positive.\n\nWe are asked to find the smallest eigenvalue for the specific parameters $\\gamma=3.0\\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\lambda=1.0\\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, and $\\theta=\\pi/3$. For $\\theta=\\pi/3$, we have $\\cos\\theta = \\cos(\\pi/3) = 1/2$.\nThe eigenvalues are:\n1. $\\mu_1 = \\lambda = 1.0 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n2. $\\mu_2 = \\gamma(1 + |\\cos(\\pi/3)|) = (3.0 \\times 10^9)(1 + 1/2) = (3.0 \\times 10^9)(1.5) = 4.5 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n3. $\\mu_3 = \\gamma(1 - |\\cos(\\pi/3)|) = (3.0 \\times 10^9)(1 - 1/2) = (3.0 \\times 10^9)(0.5) = 1.5 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe set of eigenvalues is $\\{1.0 \\times 10^9, 4.5 \\times 10^9, 1.5 \\times 10^9\\}$, all in units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$. The smallest of these is $1.0 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. Since this smallest eigenvalue is strictly positive, the Kossakowski matrix is positive definite, confirming that the generator is indeed completely positive for the given parameters. The question requests the value of this smallest eigenvalue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.0 \\times 10^9}$$"}]}
