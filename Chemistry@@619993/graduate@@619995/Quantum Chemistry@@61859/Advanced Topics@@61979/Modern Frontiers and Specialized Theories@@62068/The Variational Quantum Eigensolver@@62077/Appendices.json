The tapering is based on symmetries implied by the conservation of total particle number, $N$, and total spin projection, $S_z$.\n\nThe system consists of $M=8$ spin-orbitals, which under the parity mapping corresponds to a system of $8$ qubits, indexed $j=0, 1, \\dots, 7$. The spin-orbitals are ordered such that the first $4$ ($p=0, 1, 2, 3$) are spin-up ($\\alpha$) and the next $4$ ($p=4, 5, 6, 7$) are spin-down ($\\beta$).\n\nThe core of the problem lies in translating the fermionic symmetries into qubit operator symmetries. The key is the provided definition of the parity mapping: the eigenvalue of the single-qubit Pauli operator $Z_k$ acting on qubit $k$ corresponds to the parity of the total number of fermions in spin-orbitals $0$ through $k$. Mathematically, if $\\{n_p\\}_{p=0}^7$ are the fermionic occupation numbers, the eigenvalue of $Z_k$ is $(-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{k} n_p}$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ is stated to commute with both the total particle number operator $N$ and the spin projection operator $S_z$. The definitions are given as:\n$$N = \\sum_{p=0}^{7} n_p$$\n$$S_z = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p - \\sum_{p=4}^{7} n_p\\right)$$\nLet us define the number of spin-up and spin-down electrons as $N_{\\alpha} = \\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p$ and $N_{\\beta} = \\sum_{p=4}^{7} n_p$. Then $N = N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta}$ and $S_z = \\frac{1}{2}(N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta})$.\n\nSince $[H, N] = 0$ and $[H, S_z] = 0$, the Hamiltonian also commutes with any function of $N$ and $S_z$. Specifically, since $N_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2}N + S_z$ and $N_{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2}N - S_z$, it follows that $[H, N_{\\alpha}]=0$ and $[H, N_{\\beta}]=0$.\nFor a specific electronic state, the values of $N_{\\alpha}$ and $N_{\\beta}$ are fixed integers. This implies that the parities of these numbers, $(-1)^{N_{\\alpha}}$ and $(-1)^{N_{\\beta}}$, are also conserved quantities. These conserved parities give rise to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries that can be exploited for qubit tapering. Each independent $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry allows for the removal of one qubit. Our task is to find the qubit operators that correspond to these symmetries.\n\nFirst, consider the symmetry associated with the conservation of $N_{\\alpha}$. The parity of the number of spin-up electrons is given by $(-1)^{N_{\\alpha}} = (-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p}$. We seek a qubit operator whose eigenvalues are equal to this quantity for any valid fermionic state. According to the definition of the parity mapping, the eigenvalue of the operator $Z_3$ is precisely $(-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p}$. Therefore, the qubit operator corresponding to the parity of $N_{\\alpha}$ is $Z_3$. Since this parity is conserved, the transformed Hamiltonian on the qubit space must commute with $Z_3$. Thus, $Z_3$ is a stabilizer generator.\n\nNext, we need to find a second, independent symmetry. We can use the conservation of the total particle number $N$. The parity of $N$ is $(-1)^{N} = (-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{7} n_p}$. Applying the definition of the parity mapping for the last qubit, $k=7$, we find that the eigenvalue of the operator $Z_7$ is $(-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{7} n_p}$. Consequently, the qubit operator corresponding to the parity of the total particle number is $Z_7$. Since $N$ is a conserved quantity, $Z_7$ commutes with the qubit Hamiltonian and serves as another stabilizer generator.\n\nWe have identified two stabilizer generators: $S_1 = Z_3$ and $S_2 = Z_7$. These operators act on different qubits and are therefore independent. They generate an abelian group of order $4$, $\\{I, Z_3, Z_7, Z_3Z_7\\}$, where $I$ is the identity operator. The number of independent generators determines the number of qubits that can be tapered. In this case, we have two independent generators.\n\nTherefore, $2$ qubits can be tapered by exploiting the symmetries associated with fixed $N$ and $S_z$. The problem asks for the explicit stabilizer generators, written as single Pauli $Z$ operators on specific qubits, ordered by increasing index. The generators we have found are $Z_3$ and $Z_7$.\n\nTo be complete, let us verify the operator for the parity of $N_{\\beta}$.\n$N_{\\beta} = \\sum_{p=4}^{7} n_p = \\left(\\sum_{p=0}^{7} n_p\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p\\right)$.\nThe parity is $(-1)^{N_{\\beta}} = (-1)^{(\\sum_{p=0}^{7} n_p) - (\\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p)} = \\frac{(-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{7} n_p}}{(-1)^{\\sum_{p=0}^{3} n_p}}$.\nThe corresponding qubit operator is the product of the operators for the numerator and the inverse of the denominator. This gives $Z_7 (Z_3)^{-1}$. Since $Z_3$ is a Pauli operator, $(Z_3)^{-1} = Z_3$. The operator for the parity of $N_{\\beta}$ is thus $Z_7 Z_3$. The set of generators $\\{Z_3, Z_7 Z_3\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{Z_3, Z_7\\}$, as they generate the same group. The problem's request for generators of the form $Z_j$ makes the choice of $Z_3$ and $Z_7$ the direct and correct one.\n\nIn summary, the conservation of spin-up particle number $N_{\\alpha}$ and total particle number $N$ leads to two independent $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries in the qubit representation. These symmetries are generated by the operators $Z_3$ and $Z_7$. This allows for the tapering of $2$ qubits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & Z_3 & Z_7 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2823803"}, {"introduction": "The expressiveness and cost of a VQE algorithm are dominated by the choice of the variational ansatz.

The UCCSD generator includes one single-excitation operator for each occupied-to-virtual spin-orbital pair and one double-excitation operator for each unordered pair of occupied spin-orbitals exciting into an unordered pair of virtual spin-orbitals. Use first-order Trotterization of the UCCSD unitary into a product over exponentials of individual excitation generators.\n\nAdopt the following circuit cost model, representative of standard minimal fermionic-excitation gate synthesis on fully connected hardware: each compiled single-excitation unitary contributes exactly $c_s = 2$ Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, and each compiled double-excitation unitary contributes exactly $c_d = 8$ CNOT gates.

It is a direct application of combinatorial principles to a standard model in quantum chemistry and quantum computing. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the total CNOT count, which we denote as $C_{total}$, for a single layer of a first-order Trotterized Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz. The total count is the sum of the counts from single-excitation and double-excitation circuits.\n$$C_{total} = C_s + C_d$$\nHere, $C_s$ is the total CNOT count from all single-excitation terms, and $C_d$ is the total CNOT count from all double-excitation terms.\n\nThese counts are determined by the number of excitation operators of each type, multiplied by the CNOT cost per operator. Let $N_s$ be the number of single-excitation operators and $N_d$ be the number of double-excitation operators. The costs per operator are given as $c_s = 2$ and $c_d = 8$.\nThus, our expression for the total CNOT count is:\n$$C_{total} = N_s \\cdot c_s + N_d \\cdot c_d$$\n\nOur first task is to determine $N_s$ and $N_d$ as functions of the number of occupied spin-orbitals, $n_o$, and the number of virtual spin-orbitals, $n_v$.\n\nLet us first consider the single excitations. A single-excitation operator, $T_1$, corresponds to promoting one electron from an occupied spin-orbital to a virtual spin-orbital. The number of ways to choose one occupied spin-orbital from a set of $n_o$ is simply $n_o$. The number of ways to choose one virtual spin-orbital from a set of $n_v$ is $n_v$. Since the choice of the occupied orbital and the virtual orbital are independent events, the total number of distinct single-excitation operators is the product of these two numbers.\n$$N_s = n_o \\cdot n_v$$\n\nNext, we consider the double excitations. A double-excitation operator, $T_2$, corresponds to promoting two electrons from two distinct occupied spin-orbitals to two distinct virtual spin-orbitals. The problem specifies that we must consider an \"unordered pair of occupied spin-orbitals\" and an \"unordered pair of virtual spin-orbitals.\" This is a problem of combinations.\nThe number of ways to choose an unordered pair of $2$ occupied spin-orbitals from a set of $n_o$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_o}{2}$.\n$$\\binom{n_o}{2} = \\frac{n_o!}{2!(n_o - 2)!} = \\frac{n_o (n_o - 1)}{2}$$\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose an unordered pair of $2$ virtual spin-orbitals from a set of $n_v$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_v}{2}$.\n$$\\binom{n_v}{2} = \\frac{n_v!}{2!(n_v - 2)!} = \\frac{n_v (n_v - 1)}{2}$$\nThe total number of distinct double-excitation operators, $N_d$, is the product of the number of ways to choose the occupied pair and the virtual pair.\n$$N_d = \\binom{n_o}{2} \\binom{n_v}{2} = \\left(\\frac{n_o (n_o - 1)}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n_v (n_v - 1)}{2}\\right) = \\frac{n_o (n_o - 1) n_v (n_v - 1)}{4}$$\n\nNow we can assemble the final expression for $C_{total}$ by substituting the expressions for $N_s$ and $N_d$, and the given cost values $c_s = 2$ and $c_d = 8$, into our initial equation.\n$$C_{total}(n_o, n_v) = (n_o n_v) \\cdot 2 + \\left( \\frac{n_o (n_o - 1) n_v (n_v - 1)}{4} \\right) \\cdot 8$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final closed-form function for the total CNOT count.\n$$C_{total}(n_o, n_v) = 2 n_o n_v + 2 n_o (n_o - 1) n_v (n_v - 1)$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the total CNOT count.\n\nThe problem also requires an analysis of the asymptotic scaling in the large-$N$ limit, where $n_o \\sim N$ and $n_v \\sim N$. We examine the two terms in our expression for $C_{total}$.\nThe first term, from single excitations, is $2 n_o n_v$. In the large-$N$ limit, this scales as $O(N^2)$.\n$$2 n_o n_v \\sim 2 N \\cdot N = 2 N^2$$\nThe second term, from double excitations, is $2 n_o (n_o - 1) n_v (n_v - 1)$. For large $n_o$ and $n_v$, this term is dominated by the highest powers.\n$$2 n_o (n_o - 1) n_v (n_v - 1) \\approx 2 (n_o^2) (n_v^2) \\sim 2 N^2 \\cdot N^2 = 2 N^4$$\nThis term scales as $O(N^4)$.\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, the $O(N^4)$ term dominates the $O(N^2)$ term. Therefore, the asymptotic scaling of the total CNOT count for a single Trotter layer of UCCSD is $O(N^4)$.

The Pauli operators in this set are either $I$ or $Z$. Since $[Z, I] = 0$ and $[Z, Z] = 0$, all operators at this position commute with each other.\n\n- For qubit $1$ (the second qubit), the operators are $\\{I, Z, Z\\}$. Similarly, the Pauli operators in this set are either $I$ or $Z$. Since $[I, Z] = 0$ and $[Z, Z] = 0$, all operators at this position also commute with each other.\n\nSince the operators commute on a per-qubit basis for all pairs of strings in the set $\\{P^{(1)}, P^{(2)}, P^{(3)}\\}$, the entire set is mutually qubit-wise commuting. Consequently, all three Pauli strings can be measured simultaneously in a single measurement group.\n\nThis single group requires a measurement setting that is compatible with all member strings. To measure a Pauli string containing a non-identity operator $P_i \\in \\{X, Y, Z\\}$ on qubit $i$, one must measure qubit $i$ in the eigenbasis of $P_i$.\n- To measure $P^{(1)} = Z \\otimes I$, we must measure qubit $0$ in the $Z$-basis.\n- To measure $P^{(2)} = I \\otimes Z$, we must measure qubit $1$ in the $Z$-basis.\n- To measure $P^{(3)} = Z \\otimes Z$, we must measure qubit $0$ in the $Z$-basis and qubit $1$ in the $Z$-basis.\n\nAll three requirements are satisfied by a single measurement setting: measuring both qubit $0$ and qubit $1$ in the $Z$-basis.
