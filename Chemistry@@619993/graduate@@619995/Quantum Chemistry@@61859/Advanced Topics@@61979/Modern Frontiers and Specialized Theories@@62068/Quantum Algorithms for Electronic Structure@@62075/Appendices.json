We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts, which we will solve sequentially.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum number of phase bits, $m$, required for the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm. The energy resolution from the discretization of the phase is given as $\\Delta E = W/2^{m}$, where $W$ is the spectral width of the Hamiltonian in the relevant sector. We are given $W = 4$ Hartree and require the energy precision $\\varepsilon_{E}$ to be at most $0.001$ Hartree.

The probability of failure in all $R$ runs is $(1-p)^{R}$. The probability of at least one success is the complement:\n$$\nP(\\text{at least one success}) = 1 - (1-p)^{R}\n$$\nWe impose the condition:\n$$\n1 - (1-p)^{R} \\geq 0.9\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $p$:\n$$\n1 - (0.2)^{R} \\geq 0.9\n$$\nRearranging the inequality gives:\n$$\n0.1 \\geq (0.2)^{R}\n$$\nTo find the minimum integer $R$ that satisfies this, we take the logarithm of both sides.

Therefore, the minimum cost will be achieved when the error constraint is active, that is, when the total error is exactly equal to the tolerance:\n$$\\epsilon_{m} + \\epsilon_{t} = E_{\\text{tol}}$$\nSubstituting the given models for the error terms, the constraint becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\kappa}{\\sqrt{N}} + \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta r) = E_{\\text{tol}}$$\n\nThis is a problem of minimizing $C(N, r)$ subject to the constraint $\\Phi(N, r) = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\sqrt{N}} + \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta r) - E_{\\text{tol}} = 0$. We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}$, is defined as:\n$$\\mathcal{L}(N, r, \\lambda) = C(N, r) - \\lambda \\Phi(N, r)$$\n$$\\mathcal{L}(N, r, \\lambda) = N(g_{0} + g_{1} r) - \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{\\sqrt{N}} + \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta r) - E_{\\text{tol}} \\right)$$\n\nTo find the extremum, we set the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $N$, $r$, and $\\lambda$ to zero.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $N$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial N} = (g_{0} + g_{1} r) - \\lambda \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa N^{-3/2}\\right) = g(r) + \\frac{\\lambda \\kappa}{2 N^{3/2}} = 0 \\quad (1)$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial r} = N g_{1} - \\lambda \\left(-\\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta r)\\right) = N g_{1} + \\lambda \\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta r) = 0 \\quad (2)$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\lambda$ recovers the constraint equation.\n\nFrom equation (1), we solve for the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{2 N^{3/2} g(r)}{\\kappa}$$\nFrom equation (2), we also solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\frac{N g_{1}}{\\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta r)}$$\n\nEquating these two expressions for $\\lambda$ gives the condition for optimality:\n$$-\\frac{2 N^{3/2} g(r)}{\\kappa} = -\\frac{N g_{1}}{\\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta r)}$$\n$$\\frac{2 \\sqrt{N} g(r)}{\\kappa} = \\frac{g_{1}}{\\alpha \\beta \\exp(-\\beta r)}$$\nWe recognize the error terms $\\epsilon_{m} = \\kappa/\\sqrt{N}$ and $\\epsilon_{t} = \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta r)$. Substituting these into the optimality condition yields a concise relationship between the error contributions and the resource costs:\n$$\\frac{2 g(r)}{\\epsilon_{m}} = \\frac{g_{1}}{\\beta \\epsilon_{t}} \\quad \\implies \\quad 2 \\beta g(r) \\epsilon_{t} = g_{1} \\epsilon_{m}$$\nThis equation provides the optimal partitioning of the total error budget $E_{\\text{tol}}$ between measurement error and truncation error.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the optimal error values $\\epsilon_{m}^*$ and $\\epsilon_{t}^*$:\n$$1) \\quad \\epsilon_{m}^* + \\epsilon_{t}^* = E_{\\text{tol}}$$\n$$2) \\quad 2 \\beta \\left(g_{0} + g_{1} r^*\\right) \\epsilon_{t}^* = g_{1} \\epsilon_{m}^*$$\nThe optimal depth $r^*$ is itself a function of $\\epsilon_{t}^*$ via the relation $\\epsilon_{t}^* = \\alpha \\exp(-\\beta r^*)$, which implies $r^* = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\epsilon_{t}^*}\\right)$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$2 \\beta \\left(g_{0} + \\frac{g_{1}}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\epsilon_{t}^*}\\right)\\right) \\epsilon_{t}^* = g_{1} \\left(E_{\\text{tol}} - \\epsilon_{t}^*\\right)$$\n$$2 \\beta g_{0} \\epsilon_{t}^* + 2 g_{1} \\epsilon_{t}^* \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\epsilon_{t}^*}\\right) = g_{1} E_{\\text{tol}} - g_{1} \\epsilon_{t}^*$$\nRearranging terms, we obtain a single transcendental equation for the optimal truncation error, $\\epsilon_{t}^*$:\n$$\\left(2 \\beta g_{0} + g_{1}\\right) \\epsilon_{t}^* + 2 g_{1} \\epsilon_{t}^* \\left(\\ln(\\alpha) - \\ln(\\epsilon_{t}^*)\\right) = g_{1} E_{\\text{tol}}$$\n$$\\epsilon_{t}^* \\left[ (2 \\beta g_{0} + g_{1} + 2 g_{1} \\ln \\alpha) - 2 g_{1} \\ln \\epsilon_{t}^* \\right] = g_{1} E_{\\text{tol}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}$ Hartree\n$\\beta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-1}$ per layer\n$g_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{2}$\n$g_{1} = 4.0 \\times 10^{1}$\n$E_{\\text{tol}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ Hartree\n\nThe coefficients are:\n$2 \\beta g_{0} + g_{1} = 2(0.5)(200) + 40 = 240$\n$2 g_{1} = 2(40) = 80$\n$\\ln \\alpha = \\ln(0.1) \\approx -2.302585$\n$g_{1} E_{\\text{tol}} = 40 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.04$\n\nThe equation for $\\epsilon_{t}^*$ (letting $x = \\epsilon_{t}^*$) becomes:\n$$x [ (240 + 80 \\times (-2.302585)) - 80 \\ln x ] = 0.04$$\n$$x [ (240 - 184.2068) - 80 \\ln x ] = 0.04$$\n$$x [ 55.7932 - 80 \\ln x ] = 0.04$$\n\nThis equation must be solved numerically for $x = \\epsilon_{t}^*$. Using a numerical root-finding method (such as Newton's method or simply testing values), we find the solution to be approximately $\\epsilon_{t}^* \\approx 4.688 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hartree.\n\nWith this optimal value for $\\epsilon_{t}^*$, we can determine all other quantities:\n1.
