Your task is to implement a complete program that, based on the cycle and first-principles reasoning, computes numerical values for the outer-sphere and inner-sphere contributions and their sum, for a provided test suite.\n\nThe derivation must start from a fundamental base appropriate for electron transfer in condensed phase: harmonic free-energy surfaces for diabatic states, the Boltzmann distribution at temperature $T$, linear response and the Fluctuation–Dissipation Theorem (FDT), and the harmonic oscillator description of intramolecular normal modes. You must proceed from these principles to an algorithm that:\n- Uses the statistics of vertical energy-gap fluctuations from classical MD at a fixed temperature $T$ to determine the outer-sphere reorganization energy.\n- Uses the normal-mode picture from QC (for small displacements between donor and acceptor equilibrium structures) to determine the inner-sphere reorganization energy directly from mode-resolved properties.\n\nDo not use or quote any pre-packaged electron-transfer formula as a starting point in your derivation. Instead, justify each step from the above fundamental base, and then implement it.\n\nMathematical and physical requirements to observe:\n- Treat the solvent coordinate as Gaussian under linear response, and relate the curvature of the harmonic free-energy surface to the variance of the vertical energy gap at temperature $T$ through equilibrium fluctuation theory.\n- Treat the intramolecular modes as independent harmonic oscillators, and express the reorganization energy in terms of mode energies and displacements.

It requires a correct derivation from fundamental principles and their application to numerical data.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe electron transfer process is described as a transition between two diabatic electronic states, a reactant state $R$ (e.g., donor-localized charge) and a product state $P$ (e.g., acceptor-localized charge). The energy of these states depends on the configuration of the surrounding solvent and the internal geometry of the molecule. We partition the nuclear coordinates into two sets: a collective coordinate for the solvent, $X$, and a set of internal vibrational normal mode coordinates, $\\{q_j\\}$. We assume these are separable.\n\n**1. Outer-Sphere Reorganization Energy ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}}$)**\n\nWe model the solvent's effect through a single collective coordinate, $X$. Within the linear response approximation, the free energy surfaces of the reactant ($G_R$) and product ($G_P$) states as a function of $X$ are parabolic:\n$$ G_R(X) = \\frac{1}{2} k X^2 $$\n$$ G_P(X) = \\frac{1}{2} k (X - X_0)^2 + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\nHere, we have set the minimum of the reactant surface at $X=0$ for convenience. The product surface has the same curvature (force constant $k$) and is shifted to a minimum at $X=X_0$. $\\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}}$ is the free energy change of the reaction at the product's equilibrium geometry.\n\nThe outer-sphere reorganization energy, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}}$, is defined as the energy required to move the system from the reactant's equilibrium configuration ($X=0$) to the product's equilibrium configuration ($X=X_0$) while remaining on the reactant free energy surface.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = G_R(X_0) - G_R(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2 $$\n\nThe problem requires us to connect this to the fluctuations of the vertical energy gap, $\\Delta E(X) = G_P(X) - G_R(X)$.\n$$ \\Delta E(X) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k (X - X_0)^2 + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k X^2 \\right) = -k X_0 X + \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2 + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\nRecognizing that $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2$, we can write:\n$$ \\Delta E(X) = -k X_0 X + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} $$\n\nIn a classical MD simulation of the reactant state, the system samples configurations $X$ according to the Boltzmann distribution $P(X) \\propto \\exp(-G_R(X) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T))$. Since $G_R(X)$ is quadratic, the distribution of $X$ is Gaussian with mean $\\langle X \\rangle = 0$ and variance $\\sigma_X^2 = \\langle X^2 \\rangle - \\langle X \\rangle^2 = \\langle X^2 \\rangle$. From equilibrium statistical mechanics for a harmonic potential, this variance is given by $\\sigma_X^2 = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / k$.\n\nWe now compute the variance of the energy gap, $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2$, over the equilibrium fluctuations of the reactant state. The mean energy gap is $\\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\langle -k X_0 X + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}} \\rangle = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\Delta G^0_{\\mathrm{el}}$, since $\\langle X \\rangle = 0$.\nThe variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = \\langle (\\Delta E - \\langle \\Delta E \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = \\langle (-k X_0 X)^2 \\rangle = (k X_0)^2 \\langle X^2 \\rangle $$\nSubstituting $\\langle X^2 \\rangle = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / k$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = (k X_0)^2 \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{k} = k X_0^2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nWe have two relations: $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{1}{2} k X_0^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = k X_0^2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. We can eliminate the microscopic parameters $k$ and $X_0$ by noting that $k X_0^2 = \\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}}$ yields the desired result, an instance of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\nThe variance $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2$ is computed from the provided MD time series of $\\Delta E$ values. For a sample of size $N$, the population variance is $\\sigma_{\\Delta E}^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\Delta E_i - \\mu_{\\Delta E})^2$, where $\\mu_{\\Delta E} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta E_i$.\n\n**2. Inner-Sphere Reorganization Energy ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}}$)**\n\nIntramolecular vibrations are treated as a set of independent harmonic oscillators. For a single normal mode $j$ with coordinate $q_j$ and angular frequency $\\omega_j$, the potential energy surfaces for the reactant and product electronic states are:\n$$ V_R(q_j) = \\frac{1}{2} m_j \\omega_j^2 q_j^2 $$\n$$ V_P(q_j) = \\frac{1}{2} m_j \\omega_j^2 (q_j - d_j)^2 $$\nwhere $d_j$ is the displacement in the equilibrium geometry along mode $j$ upon electron transfer.\n\nThe inner-sphere reorganization energy for this mode, $\\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}}$, is the energy to distort the reactant from its equilibrium ($q_j=0$) to the product's equilibrium geometry ($q_j=d_j$):\n$$ \\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = V_R(d_j) - V_R(0) = \\frac{1}{2} m_j \\omega_j^2 d_j^2 $$\nThe problem provides the dimensionless Huang-Rhys factor, $S_j$, which is defined as the reorganization energy in units of the vibrational energy quantum, $\\hbar \\omega_j$:\n$$ S_j = \\frac{\\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}}}{\\hbar \\omega_j} $$\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = S_j \\hbar \\omega_j$. The quantum of vibrational energy can be expressed using the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_j$ (in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) via the relation $\\Delta E_j = h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. Note that $\\hbar \\omega_j = h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j$.\nSo, the contribution from mode $j$ is:\n$$ \\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = S_j (h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j) $$\nSince the modes are independent, the total inner-sphere reorganization energy is the sum over all modes:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\sum_j \\lambda_{j, \\mathrm{in}} = \\sum_j S_j (h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j) $$\nThe energy term $h c \\tilde{\\nu}_j$ is calculated using the provided conversion factor from $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n**3. Total Reorganization Energy ($\\lambda$)**\n\nUnder the assumption of separability between solvent and intramolecular coordinates, the total reorganization energy is the sum of the outer-sphere and inner-sphere contributions:\n$$ \\lambda = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{out}} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\n\nThis completes the derivation required to implement the solution.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes outer-sphere, inner-sphere, and total Marcus reorganization energies\n    for a suite of test cases based on first-principles derivations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants as specified in the problem.\n    # Boltzmann constant in eV/K.\n    K_B = 8.617333262e-5\n    # Conversion factor from cm^-1 to eV.\n    CM_TO_EV = 1.239841984e-4\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"T\": 300,  # Kelvin\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [0.10, 0.12, 0.08, 0.11, 0.09],  # eV\n            \"modes\": [(1500, 0.5), (300, 0.2)]  # (wavenumber cm^-1, Huang-Rhys factor S)\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 298,\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [0.20, 0.20, 0.20, 0.20],\n            \"modes\": [(1000, 0.0), (500, 0.0)]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 310,\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [-0.05, 0.05, -0.15, 0.15, 0.00],\n            \"modes\": [(1800, 1.2)]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 350,\n            \"delta_E_samples\": [0.30, 0.25, 0.35, 0.20],\n            \"modes\": [(1000, 0.3), (1200, 0.1), (500, 0.05)]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Extract data for the current case\n        T = case[\"T\"]\n        delta_E_samples = np.array(case[\"delta_E_samples\"])\n        modes = case[\"modes\"]\n\n        # --- Calculate Outer-Sphere Reorganization Energy (lambda_out) ---\n        # The derivation yields lambda_out = sigma_E^2 / (2 * k_B * T), where\n        # sigma_E^2 is the variance of the vertical energy gap fluctuations.\n        # The problem specifies to use the population variance (ddof=0), which is numpy's default.\n        if len(delta_E_samples) > 0:\n            variance_delta_E = np.var(delta_E_samples)\n        else:\n            variance_delta_E = 0.0\n            \n        # Thermal energy term\n        k_B_T = K_B * T\n        \n        # Avoid division by zero if T=0, though not in test cases\n        if k_B_T > 0:\n            lambda_out = variance_delta_E / (2 * k_B_T)\n        else:\n            lambda_out = 0.0\n\n        # --- Calculate Inner-Sphere Reorganization Energy (lambda_in) ---\n        # The derivation yields lambda_in = sum_j(S_j * h * c * nu_j), where\n        # S_j is the Huang-Rhys factor and (h*c*nu_j) is the vibrational energy quantum for mode j.\n        lambda_in = 0.0\n        for wavenumber, S_factor in modes:\n            # Convert wavenumber (cm^-1) to vibrational energy quantum (eV)\n            vibrational_energy = wavenumber * CM_TO_EV\n            # Add the mode's contribution to the total inner-sphere energy\n            lambda_in += S_factor * vibrational_energy\n\n        # --- Calculate Total Reorganization Energy (lambda) ---\n        lambda_total = lambda_out + lambda_in\n\n        # Round results to six decimal places as required\n        results_for_case = [\n            round(lambda_out, 6),\n            round(lambda_in, 6),\n            round(lambda_total, 6)\n        ]\n        all_results.append(results_for_case)\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as specified.\n    # Example format: [[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i],[j,k,l]]\n    result_str = str(all_results).replace(\" \", \"\")\n    print(result_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2904117"}, {"introduction": "This final practice serves as a capstone, bringing together all the core components of Marcus theory to predict an experimentally observable quantity.
