We shall therefore proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. The time-evolution operator for a time-independent Hamiltonian $H$ is given by $U(t) = \\exp(-iHt/\\hbar)$. For an eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$ of the Hamiltonian such that $H|\\psi\\rangle = E|\\psi\\rangle$, the action of the evolution operator is $U(t)|\\psi\\rangle = \\exp(-iEt/\\hbar)|\\psi\\rangle$. Working in atomic units, the reduced Planck constant is $\\hbar = 1$, so the eigenvalue of $U(t)$ is $\\exp(-iEt)$.\n\nThe quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm measures this eigenvalue and expresses it in the form $e^{2\\pi i \\phi}$, where $\\phi \\in [0, 1)$ is the estimated phase. By equating the two expressions for the eigenvalue, we establish the core relationship:\n$$e^{2 \\pi i \\phi} = \\exp(-iEt)$$\nThe equality of these complex numbers implies that their arguments must be equal modulo $2\\pi$. Therefore,\n$$2 \\pi \\phi = -Et + 2 \\pi k$$\nwhere $k$ is an arbitrary integer. This integer $k$ arises from the periodic nature of the complex exponential function, representing the so-called \"phase wrap-around\" ambiguity. Solving for the energy $E$ yields the mapping from the measured phase $\\phi$ to the physical energy:\n$$E(\\phi, k) = \\frac{2\\pi}{t}(k - \\phi)$$\nThis equation shows that a single measured phase $\\phi$ corresponds to a set of possible energies, indexed by the integer $k$. To resolve this ambiguity and determine the correct value of $k$, we must use the provided prior information that the energy lies within a specific spectral window, $E \\in [-0.2, 0.2]$ Hartree.\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Coherent evolution time: $t = 20$ atomic units.\n- Measured phase mean: $\\phi = 0.98$.\n- Prior energy window: $E \\in [-0.2, 0.2]$ Hartree.\n\nSubstituting the values of $t$ and $\\phi$ into the energy expression gives:\n$$E(k) = \\frac{2\\pi}{20}(k - 0.98) = \\frac{\\pi}{10}(k - 0.98)$$\nWe now impose the constraint from the spectral window:\n$$-0.2 \\le E(k) \\le 0.2$$\n$$-0.2 \\le \\frac{\\pi}{10}(k - 0.98) \\le 0.2$$\nTo find the valid range for the integer $k$, we solve this inequality:\n$$-\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\le k - 0.98 \\le \\frac{2}{\\pi}$$\n$$0.98 - \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\le k \\le 0.98 + \\frac{2}{\\pi}$$\nUsing the approximation $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we find $2/\\pi \\approx 0.63662$.

We apply the formula for linear error propagation to the unwrapped energy expression, $E(\\phi) = \\frac{2\\pi}{t}(k-\\phi)$. Since the uncertainty in $\\phi$ is small, the determined value of $k=1$ remains constant over the relevant range of phase values, so we can treat $k$ and $t$ as constants.

The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors.\n\nThe core task is to determine the resource requirements for the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm to estimate a Hamiltonian eigenvalue $E$ to a specified precision $\\varepsilon$.\n\nFirst, we relate the energy eigenvalue $E$ of the Hamiltonian $H$ to the phase of the eigenvalue of the unitary operator $U = \\exp(-i H t)$. Let $\\lvert E \\rangle$ be an eigenstate of $H$ with eigenvalue $E$. Then, applying $U$ to $\\lvert E \\rangle$ gives:\n$$U \\lvert E \\rangle = \\exp(-i H t) \\lvert E \\rangle = \\exp(-i E t) \\lvert E \\rangle$$\nThe QPE algorithm is designed to estimate the phase $\\phi$ in the eigenvalue equation $U \\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\exp(i \\phi) \\lvert \\psi \\rangle$. By comparison, the phase for the eigenstate $\\lvert E \\rangle$ is $\\phi = -E t$.\n\nThe problem states that the spectrum of $H$ lies in the interval $[0, W]$, where $W = 10$ Hartree. The evolution time is chosen as $t = \\pi/W$. This choice maps the energy range $[0, W]$ to a specific phase range.\nFor $E=0$, the phase is $\\phi = -0 \\cdot t = 0$.\nFor $E=W$, the phase is $\\phi = -W t = -W (\\pi/W) = -\\pi$.\nThus, the phase $\\phi$ corresponding to any energy eigenvalue $E \\in [0, W]$ lies in the interval $[-\\pi, 0]$. This interval has a length of $\\pi$, which is less than $2\\pi$, so there is no ambiguity in the phase (no \"phase wrapping\").\n\nThe QPE algorithm uses an $n$-qubit register to estimate the phase. The algorithm outputs a classical integer $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2^n - 1\\}$, which provides an estimate of the phase $\\phi$ via the relation $\\tilde{\\phi} = 2\\pi (j/2^n)$. However, our phase $\\phi = -Et$ is negative. The QPE algorithm finds a value $\\theta$ such that the eigenvalue is $\\exp(i 2\\pi \\theta)$. In our case, $2\\pi \\theta = -Et \\pmod{2\\pi}$. As established, the phase is in $[-\\pi, 0]$, so for $E>0$ we have $\\theta = (2\\pi - Et)/(2\\pi) = 1 - Et/(2\\pi)$.
