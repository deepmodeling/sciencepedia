It presents a standard computational task in the field of theoretical chemistry. No flaws were found. A solution is therefore provided.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation of a single time-step of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) for a one-dimensional system of point nuclei. The dynamics are governed by classical Newtonian mechanics on a potential energy surface (PES) provided by an electronic structure oracle. All calculations are performed in atomic units.\n\nFirst, we define the physical model. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation assumes that the electronic and nuclear motions are decoupled. This allows for the concept of a PES, $E(\\mathbf{R})$, where the total electronic energy is a function of the nuclear coordinates $\\mathbf{R} = \\{R_i\\}$. The nuclei are treated as classical point particles with masses $\\{m_i\\}$ moving according to Newton's second law, where the force on each nucleus is derived from the PES:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{R}) = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E(\\mathbf{R}) \\implies F_i(\\mathbf{R}) = -\\frac{\\partial E(\\mathbf{R})}{\\partial R_i}\n$$\nThe acceleration of each nucleus is then given by $a_i(t) = F_i(\\mathbf{R}(t)) / m_i$.\n\nThe specific PES for this problem is a sum of harmonic bond potentials:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{R}) = \\sum_{\\text{bonds }(i,j)} E_{ij}(R_i, R_j) = \\sum_{\\text{bonds }(i,j)} \\frac{1}{2}k\\left(\\lvert R_j - R_i\\rvert - r_0\\right)^2\n$$\nwhere for each bond $(i, j)$, $k$ is the force constant and $r_0$ is the equilibrium bond length. The force on atom $j$ due to the bond with atom $i$ is:\n$$\nF_{j \\leftarrow ij} = -\\frac{\\partial E_{ij}}{\\partial R_j} = -k\\left(\\lvert R_j - R_i\\rvert - r_0\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\lvert R_j - R_i\\rvert}{\\partial R_j} = -k\\left(\\lvert R_j - R_i\\rvert - r_0\\right) \\text{sgn}(R_j - R_i)\n$$\nBy Newton's third law, the force on atom $i$ from this bond is $F_{i \\leftarrow ij} = -F_{j \\leftarrow ij}$. The total force on any given atom $i$, $F_i$, is the vector sum of forces from all bonds it participates in.\n\nTo propagate the system in time from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$, a numerical integration scheme is required. The problem specifies an algorithm which is a form of the well-known Velocity Verlet integrator. The procedure for a single time-step is as follows:\n\n1.  **Given**: At time $t$, the positions $\\mathbf{R}(t)$, velocities $\\mathbf{v}(t)$, and accelerations $\\mathbf{a}(t)$ are known. The accelerations are computed from the forces at the current positions: $\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{R}(t)) / \\mathbf{m}$.\n\n2.  **Position Update**: The new positions $\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t)$ are calculated using a Taylor expansion to second order:\n    $$\n    R_i(t+\\Delta t) = R_i(t) + v_i(t)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}a_i(t)\\Delta t^2\n    $$\n\n3.  **Force/Acceleration Update**: With the new positions $\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t)$, the forces $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t))$ are re-evaluated using the electronic structure oracle. The new accelerations $\\mathbf{a}(t+\\Delta t)$ are then computed:\n    $$\n    a_i(t+\\Delta t) = F_i(\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t)) / m_i\n    $$\n\n4.  **Velocity Update**: The new velocities $\\mathbf{v}(t+\\Delta t)$ are calculated using the average of the old and new accelerations. This step is characteristic of the Velocity Verlet algorithm and is responsible for its good energy conservation properties.\n    $$\n    v_i(t+\\Delta t) = v_i(t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_i(t) + a_i(t+\\Delta t)\\right)\\Delta t\n    $$\n\nFinally, the total energy of the system at the end of the time-step, $t+\\Delta t$, is computed. This is the sum of the potential energy at the new positions, $E(\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t))$, and the kinetic energy calculated with the new velocities, $K(\\mathbf{v}(t+\\Delta t))$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{tot}}(t+\\Delta t) = E(\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t)) + K(\\mathbf{v}(t+\\Delta t)) = E(\\mathbf{R}(t+\\Delta t)) + \\sum_i \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_i(t+\\Delta t)^2\n$$\nThis quantity is the required output for each test case, rounded to eight decimal places.

The Potential Energy Surface**\n\nThe PES, $U(\\mathbf{r})$, dictates the forces acting on the nuclei. It is approximated as a sum of internal coordinate potentials: two bond-stretching terms and one angle-bending term.\n$$ U(\\mathbf{r}) = U_{\\mathrm{Morse}}(r_1) + U_{\\mathrm{Morse}}(r_2) + U_{\\mathrm{bend}}(\\theta) $$\nwhere $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the lengths of the two O–H bonds, and $\\theta$ is the H–O–H angle.\n\nThe stretching of each O–H bond is described by a Morse potential, a realistic model for bond dissociation:\n$$ U_{\\mathrm{Morse}}(r) = D_e \\left[1 - e^{-a(r - r_0)}\\right]^2 $$\nHere, $D_e$ is the bond dissociation energy, $r_0$ is the equilibrium bond length, and $a$ controls the width of the potential well. The force derived from this potential on the two atoms forming the bond is directed along the bond vector. For a bond vector $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}}$ of length $r = \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|$, the force on the hydrogen atom is:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{H, Morse}} = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}}} U_{\\mathrm{Morse}}(r) = -\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{Morse}}}{dr} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}}} = -\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{Morse}}}{dr} \\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{r} $$\nwhere the derivative is $\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{Morse}}}{dr} = 2 D_e a \\left(1 - e^{-a(r - r_0)}\\right) e^{-a(r - r_0)}$. The force on the oxygen atom is equal and opposite, satisfying Newton's third law.\n\nThe bending of the H–O–H angle is modeled by a harmonic potential:\n$$ U_{\\mathrm{bend}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k_\\theta (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 $$\nwhere $k_\\theta$ is the angle force constant and $\\theta_0$ is the equilibrium angle. The forces are derived from the gradient of this potential: $\\mathbf{F}_i^{\\mathrm{bend}} = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i} U_{\\mathrm{bend}}(\\theta) = -k_\\theta(\\theta - \\theta_0)\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i}\\theta$. The problem provides the necessary expressions for the gradient of the angle, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_i}\\theta$, for each atom $i \\in \\{\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{H}_1, \\mathrm{H}_2\\}$. These expressions are used directly. A notable feature is the term $\\sin\\theta$ in the denominator of the gradient, which introduces a numerical singularity for linear configurations ($\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$). A robust implementation must handle or tolerate this.\n\n**2. Numerical Integration**\n\nTo solve the differential equations of motion, we employ the specified velocity Verlet algorithm. This is a time-reversible and symplectic integrator, which confers good long-term energy conservation properties. Given the positions $\\mathbf{r}(t)$, velocities $\\mathbf{v}(t)$, and accelerations $\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\mathbf{F}(t)/m$ at time $t$, the state at time $t+\\Delta t$ is computed in two stages:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\mathbf{v}(t)\\,\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{a}(t)\\,\\Delta t^2 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{v}(t+\\Delta t) = \\mathbf{v}(t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\big(\\mathbf{a}(t)+\\mathbf{a}(t+\\Delta t)\\big)\\,\\Delta t $$\nNote that computing the new velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t+\\Delta t)$ requires the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}(t+\\Delta t)$, which in turn requires calculating the forces $\\mathbf{F}(t+\\Delta t)$ at the newly computed positions $\\mathbf{r}(t+\\Delta t)$.\n\n**3. System Initialization**\n\nThe simulation begins from a defined initial state.\n- **Positions**: The oxygen atom is at the origin $(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\mathbf{0})$. The two hydrogen atoms are placed in the $xy$-plane to satisfy the equilibrium bond length $r_0$ and angle $\\theta_0$: $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_1} = (r_0, 0, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = (r_0\\cos\\theta_0, r_0\\sin\\theta_0, 0)$.\n- **Velocities**: The initial velocities are set to correspond to a target temperature $T$. This involves three steps:\n    1.  For each atom $i$ and Cartesian component, a random velocity is drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which is a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma_i^2 = k_B T / m_i$. This is performed using a pseudorandom number generator with a fixed seed ($12345$) for reproducibility.\n    2.  The total momentum of the system is set to zero by computing the center-of-mass velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{CM}} = \\frac{\\sum_i m_i \\mathbf{v}_i}{\\sum_i m_i}$, and subtracting it from each atom's velocity vector. This ensures the molecule as a whole does not exhibit net translational motion.\n    3.  The total kinetic energy, $K = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{2} m_i \\|\\mathbf{v}_i'\\|^2$, is then scaled to match a specific target value, $K_{\\mathrm{target}}$. The problem specifies $K_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{f}{2} k_B T$, where $f = 3N-3=6$ are the internal degrees of freedom for $N=3$ atoms after removing translation. All velocities are multiplied by a scaling factor $\\lambda = \\sqrt{K_{\\mathrm{target}}/K}$. This procedure is a form of thermostatting to begin the simulation at the desired temperature.\n\n**4. Implementation and Execution**\n\nThe entire simulation must be conducted in a consistent set of units. The International System of Units (SI) is the required standard: meters (m), kilograms (kg), seconds (s), and joules (J). All provided parameters must be converted accordingly before use.\n- $m_{\\mathrm{O}}, m_{\\mathrm{H}}$: from $\\mathrm{amu}$ to $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- $r_0$: from $\\mathrm{nm}$ to $\\mathrm{m}$.\n- $\\theta_0$: from degrees to radians.\n- $D_e$: from $\\mathrm{eV}$ to $\\mathrm{J}$.\n- $a$: from $\\mathrm{Å}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\n- $k_\\theta$: from $\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{-2}$ to $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{-2}$.\n- $t_{total}$: from $\\mathrm{ps}$ to $\\mathrm{s}$.\n- $\\Delta t$: from $\\mathrm{fs}$ to $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe simulation proceeds by iteratively applying the velocity Verlet algorithm for a total number of steps $n = t_{\\mathrm{total}}/\\Delta t$. After each position update, the O–H bond lengths $r_1$ and $r_2$ are checked against the dissociation criterion, $r_{\\mathrm{cut}} = 2.2\\,r_0$. If either bond length exceeds this cutoff, the molecule is considered dissociated, the simulation for that test case terminates, and the result is recorded as `True`. If the loop completes without dissociation, the result is `False`. This logic is applied to each test case specified in the problem statement. The final output is a list of these boolean results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the BOMD problem for a water molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Global constants in SI units\n    KB = 1.380649e-23  # J/K\n    EV = 1.602176634e-19  # J\n    AMU = 1.66053906660e-27  # kg\n    NA = 6.02214076e23  # mol^-1\n    CAL_TO_J = 4.184\n\n    # Model Parameters in SI units\n    M_O = 15.999 * AMU\n    M_H = 1.00784 * AMU\n    MASSES = np.array([M_O, M_H, M_H])[:, np.newaxis] # Shape (3, 1) for broadcasting\n\n    R0 = 0.096e-9  # m\n    THETA0 = 104.5 * np.pi / 180.0  # rad\n\n    DE = 5.5 * EV  # J\n    A = 2.2e10  # m^-1\n\n    # k_theta conversion: 75 kcal/mol/rad^2 - J/rad^2\n    K_THETA = 75 * 1000 * CAL_TO_J / NA  # J/rad^2\n\n    RCUT = 2.2 * R0\n\n    T_TOTAL = 1.0e-12  # s (1 picosecond)\n    \n    # Nested function to calculate forces for encapsulation\n    def calculate_forces(r):\n        \"\"\"Calculates forces on all atoms given their positions.\"\"\"\n        r_O, r_H1, r_H2 = r[0], r[1], r[2]\n        forces = np.zeros((3, 3))\n        \n        # Bond vectors\n        u1 = r_H1 - r_O\n        u2 = r_H2 - r_O\n        r1 = np.linalg.norm(u1)\n        r2 = np.linalg.norm(u2)\n        \n        # Handle case where atoms might be at the same position\n        if r1 == 0 or r2 == 0:\n            return forces\n\n        u1_hat = u1 / r1\n        u2_hat = u2 / r2\n        \n        # Morse Forces\n        exp_term1 = np.exp(-A * (r1 - R0))\n        dUm_dr1 = 2 * DE * A * exp_term1 * (1 - exp_term1)\n        \n        exp_term2 = np.exp(-A * (r2 - R0))\n        dUm_dr2 = 2 * DE * A * exp_term2 * (1 - exp_term2)\n        \n        F_H1_morse = -dUm_dr1 * u1_hat\n        F_H2_morse = -dUm_dr2 * u2_hat\n        \n        forces[1] += F_H1_morse\n        forces[2] += F_H2_morse\n        forces[0] -= (F_H1_morse + F_H2_morse)\n        \n        # Angle Bending Forces\n        cos_theta = np.dot(u1_hat, u2_hat)\n        cos_theta = np.clip(cos_theta, -1.0, 1.0)\n        theta = np.arccos(cos_theta)\n        \n        sin_theta = np.sqrt(1 - cos_theta**2)\n        if sin_theta  1e-10:\n            return forces\n\n        dUb_dtheta = K_THETA * (theta - THETA0)\n\n        grad_theta_u1 = (-1.0 / r1) * (u2_hat - cos_theta * u1_hat) / sin_theta\n        grad_theta_u2 = (-1.0 / r2) * (u1_hat - cos_theta * u2_hat) / sin_theta\n        \n        F_H1_bend = -dUb_dtheta * grad_theta_u1\n        F_H2_bend = -dUb_dtheta * grad_theta_u2\n        F_O_bend = -(F_H1_bend + F_H2_bend)\n        \n        forces[0] += F_O_bend\n        forces[1] += F_H1_bend\n        forces[2] += F_H2_bend\n        \n        return forces\n\n    # Nested function to run one simulation\n    def run_simulation(T, dt_fs):\n        \"\"\"Runs one BOMD simulation for given T and dt.\"\"\"\n        dt = dt_fs * 1e-15  # Convert fs to s\n        num_steps = int(round(T_TOTAL / dt))\n        \n        # 1.

This advanced practice guides you through the process of statistical analysis, using data from a simulated trajectory to compute fundamental thermodynamic quantities like temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and the constant-volume heat capacity $C_V$. By applying principles from statistical mechanics such as the equipartition theorem, the virial theorem, and fluctuation-dissipation relations, you will learn not only how to calculate these properties but also how to rigorously assess their statistical uncertainty using autocorrelation analysis—a critical skill for any computational scientist [@problem_id:2877597].", "problem": "A finite-temperature Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulation is run for a periodic system of $N$ atoms, sampling the canonical ensemble (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature; NVT) using a weak Nosé–Hoover thermostat that yields canonical statistics for the nuclear coordinates and momenta. The electronic structure is converged such that Pulay forces and Pulay stress are negligible (e.g., a plane-wave basis set with sufficient cutoff).

We proceed with the derivations and calculations for the four tasks.\n\n1) Derivation and calculation of Temperature ($T$)\n\nThe system is described by classical mechanics and samples the canonical ensemble. According to the equipartition theorem, the average energy associated with each unconstrained quadratic degree of freedom is $\\frac{1}{2} k_{B} T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the $N$ nuclei is a sum of quadratic terms in momentum: $K = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}_{i}|^2}{2m_{i}}$. The total number of such terms is $3N$. The problem states that the center-of-mass momentum is constrained to zero, which removes $3$ translational degrees of freedom. Therefore, the number of unconstrained quadratic degrees of freedom for the kinetic energy is $f = 3N - 3$.\n\nThe time-averaged nuclear kinetic energy, $\\langle K \\rangle$, must be equal to the ensemble average.

Thus, the estimator for $C_{V}$ is:\n$$\nC_{V} \\approx \\frac{s_{E}^{2}}{k_{B} T^2}\n$$\nWe are asked for the per-atom heat capacity in units of $k_{B}$, defined as $c_{V} \\equiv C_{V}/(N k_{B})$. Substituting our expression for $C_V$:\n$$\nc_{V} = \\frac{1}{N k_{B}} \\left( \\frac{s_{E}^{2}}{k_{B} T^2} \\right) = \\frac{s_{E}^{2}}{N k_{B}^2 T^2}\n$$\nWe are given:\n- Sample variance of total energy: $s_{E}^{2} = 1.029000 \\times 10^{-39}\\ \\mathrm{J}^{2}$.\n- $N = 20$, $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- And from part 1, $T \\approx 300.011\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nWe compute the denominator $N k_{B}^2 T^2$:\n$$\nN k_{B}^2 T^2 = 20 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})^2 \\times (300.011\\ \\mathrm{K})^2 \\approx 3.43138 \\times 10^{-40}\\ \\mathrm{J}^2\n$$\nNow we compute the dimensionless value of $c_{V}$:\n$$\nc_{V} = \\frac{1.029000 \\times 10^{-39}\\ \\mathrm{J}^{2}}{3.43138 \\times 10^{-40}\\ \\mathrm{J}^2} \\approx 2.9986\n$$\n\n4) Discussion of statistical error estimation\n\nThe estimators for $T$, $P$, and $C_V$ are computed from a finite, time-correlated trajectory. To estimate the standard error (SE) of these quantities, one must account for this correlation. The concept of an effective sample size, $N_{\\text{eff}}$, is used. For an observable $A$ with an integrated autocorrelation time $\\tau_A$, sampled over a total simulation time $T_{\\text{sim}} = M \\Delta t$, the number of effectively independent samples is $N_{\\text{eff}} = T_{\\text{sim}} / (2\\tau_A)$.\n\nFor estimators based on the mean of an observable $A$ (e.g., $T$ from $\\langle K \\rangle$ and $P$ from $\\langle 2K+\\Phi \\rangle$), the standard error of the mean is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\langle A \\rangle) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(A)}{N_{\\text{eff}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\tau_A}{T_{\\text{sim}}}\\mathrm{Var}(A)}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Var}(A)$ is the variance of the observable $A$ over the trajectory.\n\n- For temperature, $T = \\frac{2\\langle K \\rangle}{f k_{B}}$, the uncertainty is propagated from $\\langle K \\rangle$:\n$\\mathrm{SE}(T) = \\frac{2}{f k_{B}} \\mathrm{SE}(\\langle K \\rangle)$, where $\\mathrm{SE}(\\langle K \\rangle) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\tau_K}{T_{\\text{sim}}}\\mathrm{Var}(K)}$.\n\n- For pressure, $P = \\frac{\\langle 2K+\\Phi \\rangle}{3V}$, it is best to define a new observable $\\Pi = 2K+\\Phi$ and calculate its autocorrelation time $\\tau_{\\Pi}$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Pi)$. The uncertainty is then:\n$\\mathrm{SE}(P) = \\frac{1}{3V} \\mathrm{SE}(\\langle \\Pi \\rangle)$, with $\\mathrm{SE}(\\langle \\Pi \\rangle) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\tau_{\\Pi}}{T_{\\text{sim}}}\\mathrm{Var}(\\Pi)}$.\n\nFor estimators based on variance (e.g., $C_V$ from $s_E^2$), the error analysis is more complex. The standard error of the sample variance $s_E^2$ can be approximated, assuming the distribution of $E$ is nearly Gaussian, as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(s_E^2) \\approx s_E^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N_{\\text{eff},E}-1}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{eff},E} = T_{\\text{sim}} / (2\\tau_E)$.\n\nTo find the standard error of $c_V = \\frac{s_{E}^{2}}{N k_{B}^2 T^2}$, one must propagate the uncertainties from both $s_E^2$ and $T$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(c_V)}{c_V}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(s_E^2)}{s_E^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-2 \\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(T)}{T}\\right)^2 + 2 \\frac{(-2)}{T s_E^2} \\mathrm{Cov}(s_E^2, T)\n$$\nAssuming the covariance between the estimators for $T$ and $s_E^2$ is negligible, the relative error simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(c_V)}{c_V} \\approx \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(s_E^2)}{s_E^2}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SE}(T)}{T}\\right)^2}\n$$\nThis formula combines the relative uncertainty in the energy variance and the temperature to estimate the final uncertainty in the dimensionless heat capacity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.999}$$", "id": "2877597"}]}
