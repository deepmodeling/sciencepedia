It constitutes a standard calculation in atomic quantum mechanics. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe absorption oscillator strength $f_{fi}$ for an electric-dipole transition from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is a dimensionless quantity. In the length gauge, for an isotropic sample (randomly oriented atoms), one averages over the initial degenerate sublevels and sums over the final ones. The general formula in atomic units ($\\hbar=m_e=e=1$) is given by:\n$$\nf_{fi} = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\Delta E_{fi}}{g_i} \\sum_{m_i, m_f} |\\langle f, m_f | \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} | i, m_i \\rangle|^2\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta E_{fi}$ is the transition energy, $g_i$ is the degeneracy of the initial level, and the sum is over the magnetic quantum numbers of the initial and final states. The vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the position operator.\n\nThe initial state is the ground state $|1s\\rangle$, which is described by the quantum numbers $n=1$, $\\ell=0$, $m=0$. This state is non-degenerate, so the degeneracy is $g_i = 2\\ell+1 = 1$, and there is only one initial sublevel $m_i=0$. The final state is the first excited $p$-manifold, $|2p\\rangle$, which consists of three degenerate states with quantum numbers $n=2$, $\\ell=1$, and $m_f \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We must sum over these three final states.\n\nThe formula for the total oscillator strength for the $|1s\\rangle \\to |2p\\rangle$ transition is therefore:\n$$\nf_{2p \\leftarrow 1s} = \\frac{2}{3} (\\Delta E) \\sum_{m_f = -1, 0, 1} |\\langle 2, 1, m_f | \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} | 1, 0, 0 \\rangle|^2\n$$\nwhere the wavefunctions are given by $\\langle \\mathbf{r} | n, \\ell, m \\rangle = \\Psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r}) = R_{n\\ell}(r) Y_{\\ell m}(\\Omega)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy difference $\\Delta E$. In atomic units, the energy of a hydrogenic level with principal quantum number $n$ is $E_n = -\\frac{Z^2}{2n^2}$. For a hydrogen atom, the nuclear charge is $Z=1$.\nThe initial energy is $E_1 = -\\frac{1}{2(1)^2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ Hartree.\nThe final energy is $E_2 = -\\frac{1}{2(2)^2} = -\\frac{1}{8}$ Hartree.\nThe transition energy is $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = -\\frac{1}{8} - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{8}$ Hartree.\n\nNext, we evaluate the squared transition dipole moment sum, $\\sum_{m_f} |\\langle 2, 1, m_f | \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} | 1, 0, 0 \\rangle|^2$.

For $m_f=0$, we have $|\\langle 2, 1, 0 | z | 1, 0, 0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{3} I_{rad}^2$.\n\nSimilarly, we evaluate the matrix elements for $x$ and $y$.

So the integral is $\\frac{256}{81}$.\nThus, the radial integral is $I_{rad} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\frac{256}{81}$.\n\nWe can now assemble the final expression for the oscillator strength:\n$$\nf_{2p \\leftarrow 1s} = \\frac{2}{3} (\\Delta E) (I_{rad})^2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\frac{256}{81}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nf_{2p \\leftarrow 1s} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{256}{81}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{24} \\left(\\frac{2^8}{3^4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 2^3} \\frac{2^{16}}{3^8}\n$$\n$$\nf_{2p \\leftarrow 1s} = \\frac{2^{16-3}}{3^{8+1}} = \\frac{2^{13}}{3^9}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical values: $2^{13} = 8192$ and $3^9 = 19683$.\nSo, $f_{2p \\leftarrow 1s} = \\frac{8192}{19683}$.\nThe decimal value is approximately $0.416196...$, which agrees with tabulated values for the hydrogen Lyman-$\\alpha$ oscillator strength ($f \\approx 0.4162$) to the required four significant figures.

This practice explores a crucial aspect of computational design: selecting a basis set that can accurately describe the physical nature of the electronic states involved. By reasoning from the variational principle, you will analyze how the absence of diffuse functions affects calculations of Rydberg states, building the essential intuition needed to avoid common pitfalls and produce physically meaningful results for electronic spectra [@problem_id:2889032].", "problem": "A neutral, closed-shell organic molecule has low-lying excited states of both valence and Rydberg character. You plan to compute vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths using a one-electron Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) basis. Consider two choices of basis: (i) a valence-only basis lacking diffuse primitives on all atoms, and (ii) the same valence basis augmented by adding $1$ very small-exponent $s$- and $p$-type diffuse primitive on each heavy atom. You are told that Rydberg orbitals have large radial extent and resemble hydrogenic functions with $\\langle r \\rangle \\propto n^{2} a_{0}$, where $n$ is a principal-quantum-number-like index and $a_{0}$ is the Bohr radius.

It presents a standard scenario involving the calculation of electronic excited states and probes the fundamental consequences of basis set selection. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe analysis rests on three core principles:\n\n1. The **Variational Principle** and its extension to excited states, the Hylleraas-Undheim-MacDonald theorem. For a given Hermitian Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$, the eigenvalues $E_k^{(\\text{approx})}$ obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a finite $N$-dimensional basis are upper bounds to the true energies $E_k$ of the lowest $N$ states. That is, $E_k^{(\\text{approx})} \\ge E_k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. Improving the basis set by adding functions systematically lowers these approximate energy eigenvalues, bringing them closer to the true values.\n2. The **Electric-Dipole Transition Moment** $\\vec{\\mu}_{if}$ between an initial state $|\\Psi_i\\rangle$ and a final state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle$ is defined as the matrix element of the electric dipole operator $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} = -e \\sum_j \\vec{r}_j$ (sum over all electron position vectors $\\vec{r}_j$). In atomic units ($e=1$), this is $\\vec{\\mu}_{if} = \\langle \\Psi_i | -\\sum_j \\vec{r}_j | \\Psi_f \\rangle$. The magnitude of this vector determines the probability of the transition.\n3. The **Oscillator Strength** $f_{if}$ is a dimensionless measure of the transition strength. In the length gauge and atomic units ($\\hbar=m_e=e=1$), it is given by:\n$$ f_{if} = \\frac{2}{3} (E_f - E_i) |\\langle \\Psi_i | \\sum_j \\vec{r}_j | \\Psi_f \\rangle|^2 $$\nwhere $E_f - E_i$ is the vertical excitation energy.\n\nThe problem compares two basis sets. Basis (i) is a valence-only basis, comprised of basis functions suitable for describing relatively compact electron distributions. Basis (ii) augments basis (i) with diffuse functions, which are Gaussian-type orbitals with very small exponents, capable of describing spatially extended electron distributions.\n\n- **Valence states** arise from excitations between molecular orbitals that are themselves relatively compact (e.g., bonding, non-bonding, antibonding orbitals of $\\sigma$ or $\\pi$ character).\n- **Rydberg states** arise from the excitation of an electron into a very diffuse, hydrogen-like orbital of large effective principal quantum number $n$. Such an orbital is characterized by a large radial extent, $\\langle r \\rangle \\propto n^2 a_0$.\n\nA valence-only basis (i) is fundamentally inadequate for describing a Rydberg orbital. The variational principle will attempt to construct an approximation to the diffuse Rydberg orbital from the available compact basis functions. This results in an approximate wavefunction that is artificially confined in space, which incurs a very large kinetic energy penalty. Consequently, the energy of a Rydberg state is drastically overestimated with basis (i). In contrast, valence states are described with reasonable, though not perfect, accuracy by such a basis.\n\nThe addition of diffuse functions (basis ii) provides the necessary flexibility to describe the Rydberg orbital's large spatial extent. According to the variational principle, this will dramatically lower the calculated energy of the Rydberg state, bringing it much closer to the true energy. The energies of the ground state and valence excited states will also be lowered, but to a much smaller extent as these states are already reasonably well-described by the valence part of the basis.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Without diffuse basis functions, Rydberg excitation energies are biased upward and the corresponding oscillator strengths are suppressed because the approximate excited-state wavefunctions are artificially compact.**\nLet $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ be the ground state and $|\\Psi_k^{(\\text{Ryd})}\\rangle$ be a Rydberg excited state. Without diffuse functions (basis i), the approximate energy $E_k^{(\\text{Ryd, i})}$ is a very poor upper bound to the true energy, meaning it is severely overestimated. The ground-state energy $E_0^{(\\text{i})}$ is a better approximation of the true $E_0$. The excitation energy is $\\Delta E_k^{(\\text{i})} = E_k^{(\\text{Ryd, i})} - E_0^{(\\text{i})}$. Since the error in $E_k^{(\\text{Ryd, i})}$ is much larger than the error in $E_0^{(\\text{i})}$, the excitation energy $\\Delta E_k^{(\\text{i})}$ is biased significantly upward.\nThe oscillator strength depends on the transition moment squared, $|\\vec{\\mu}_{0k}|^2 = |\\langle\\Psi_0|\\sum_j \\vec{r}_j|\\Psi_k^{(\\text{Ryd})}\\rangle|^2$. The true Rydberg state $|\\Psi_k^{(\\text{Ryd})}\\rangle$ is very diffuse. The operator $\\sum_j \\vec{r}_j$ weights regions of space far from the origin. The approximate wavefunction $|\\Psi_k^{(\\text{Ryd, i})}\\rangle$ is, by necessity, artificially compact and has vanishing amplitude in these distant regions. Consequently, the magnitude of the transition-moment integral is severely underestimated with basis (i). This suppression of the transition moment typically dominates the overestimation of the $\\Delta E$ term in the formula for $f_{0k}$, leading to a suppressed oscillator strength. The reasoning presented in the statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Adding diffuse basis functions primarily lowers the ground-state energy, thereby increasing Rydberg excitation energies relative to the ground state.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. As established by the variational principle, adding functions to a basis lowers the energy of all states. The magnitude of this lowering (stabilization) is greatest for the states that were most poorly described by the initial basis. In this case, the Rydberg states are described abysmally by the valence-only basis (i), whereas the ground state is described reasonably well. Therefore, upon adding diffuse functions to create basis (ii), the stabilization energy for the Rydberg state, $|E_k^{(\\text{Ryd, ii})} - E_k^{(\\text{Ryd, i})}|$, will be far greater than the stabilization for the ground state, $|E_0^{(\\text{ii})} - E_0^{(\\text{i})}|$.\nThe new excitation energy is $\\Delta E_k^{(\\text{ii})} = E_k^{(\\text{Ryd, ii})} - E_0^{(\\text{ii})}$. Since the energy of the Rydberg state $E_k^{(\\text{Ryd})}$ drops much more than the energy of the ground state $E_0$, the net effect is a significant *decrease* in the excitation energy $\\Delta E_k$. The statement's premise (primary effect on ground state) and conclusion (increase in excitation energy) are both false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For compact valence excitations localized on heavy atoms, omission of diffuse functions typically has a small effect on both excitation energies and oscillator strengths compared to their effect on Rydberg transitions.**\nThis statement compares the sensitivity of two different types of excitations to the basis set augmentation. A valence excitation involves transitions between compact orbitals. Both the initial (ground) state and the final (valence excited) state are relatively compact and are described with comparable, reasonable accuracy by a valence-only basis. While adding diffuse functions improves both energies, the corrections are of a similar order of magnitude, and there can be a degree of error cancellation in the energy difference $\\Delta E$. The wavefunctions are also qualitatively correct, leading to a reasonable estimate of the transition moment.\nIn stark contrast, a Rydberg transition is catastrophically mis-represented by a valence-only basis, as detailed in the analysis for option A. Both the excitation energy and oscillator strength are subject to very large errors. Therefore, the effect of omitting diffuse functions is orders of magnitude more severe for Rydberg transitions than for compact valence transitions. The statement is a direct and correct consequence of the variational principle applied to wavefunctions of different spatial character.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Enlarging the basis with diffuse functions generally worsens satisfaction of the Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn (TRK) sum rule for the length-gauge oscillator strengths.**\nThe TRK sum rule, $\\sum_f f_{if} = N_e$, where $N_e$ is the number of electrons, is an exact physical law that holds true for the complete set of exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. For calculations using approximate wavefunctions from an incomplete basis set, the sum is not guaranteed to equal $N_e$. The process of enlarging a basis set, such as by adding diffuse functions, is a systematic approach toward completeness. As the basis set and the resulting wavefunctions improve and get closer to the exact ones, they must also better satisfy the properties derived from the exact solutions. Therefore, any physical constraint or sum rule, including the TRK sum rule, should be *better* satisfied with a more complete basis. The claim that satisfaction worsens is contrary to the fundamental tenet of systematic improvability in variational quantum chemistry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Disagreement between length- and velocity-gauge oscillator strengths is typically reduced when diffuse basis functions are added, particularly for transitions with diffuse character.**\nThe length-gauge and velocity-gauge forms of the oscillator strength are mathematically equivalent only when calculated with the exact eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. This equivalence stems from the commutator relation $[\\hat{H}, \\hat{\\vec{r}}] \\propto \\hat{\\vec{p}}$. For approximate wavefunctions obtained from a finite-basis calculation, this relation does not hold perfectly, and the two gauges yield different values. The magnitude of their disagreement, $|\\,f_{if}^{(\\text{L})} - f_{if}^{(\\text{V})}\\,|$, serves as an internal indicator of the quality of the wavefunctions and the incompleteness of the basis set.\nImproving the basis set by adding diffuse functions yields approximate wavefunctions that are closer to the exact ones. As a result, they will better satisfy the commutator relation, and the discrepancy between the length- and velocity-gauge oscillator strengths will decrease. This effect is most pronounced for transitions whose wavefunctions are most improved by the basis set augmentation. As diffuse functions are critical for Rydberg states, the improvement in agreement between gauges will be particularly significant for transitions to these states.

We have $4^3 = 64$ and $5^3 = 125$. The denominator is $X_2^3 - X_1^3 = 125 - 64 = 61$. The data are $\\Delta E^{(4)} = 0.2470$ a.u., $\\mu^{(4)} = 1.420$ a.u., $\\Delta E^{(5)} = 0.2490$ a.u., and $\\mu^{(5)} = 1.460$ a.u.\n\nFirst, we extrapolate the excitation energy $\\Delta E$:\n$$\\Delta E^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{\\Delta E^{(5)} \\cdot 5^3 - \\Delta E^{(4)} \\cdot 4^3}{5^3 - 4^3} = \\frac{(0.2490) \\cdot 125 - (0.2470) \\cdot 64}{61}$$\n$$\\Delta E^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{31.125 - 15.808}{61} = \\frac{15.317}{61} \\approx 0.251098 \\text{ a.u.}$$\n\nNext, we extrapolate the magnitude of the transition dipole moment $\\mu = |\\boldsymbol{\\mu}|$:\n$$\\mu^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{\\mu^{(5)} \\cdot 5^3 - \\mu^{(4)} \\cdot 4^3}{5^3 - 4^3} = \\frac{(1.460) \\cdot 125 - (1.420) \\cdot 64}{61}$$\n$$\\mu^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{182.5 - 90.88}{61} = \\frac{91.62}{61} \\approx 1.501967 \\text{ a.u.}$$\n\nNow, we use these CBS limit values to compute the CBS limit of the dimensionless oscillator strength, $f^{(\\infty)}$, using the provided definition:\n$$f^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\Delta E^{(\\infty)}\\,(\\mu^{(\\infty)})^2$$\nSubstituting the extrapolated values:\n$$f^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( \\frac{15.317}{61} \\right) \\left( \\frac{91.62}{61} \\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{2}{3} (0.251098) (1.501967)^2$$\n$$f^{(\\infty)} \\approx 0.377595...$$\n\nThe problem also requires justification for this procedure. The principal justification for extrapolating the constituent properties $\\Delta E$ and $\\mu$ separately, rather than extrapolating the composite property $f$ directly, lies in the adherence to the underlying physical model of basis-set convergence. The $X^{-3}$ power law is a leading-order approximation derived for quantities, like the correlation energy, that converge systematically with the one-particle basis. This model is known to be a robust approximation for $\\Delta E$ and, to a good extent, for property expectation values like $\\mu$.\nIf we analyze the convergence of $f^{(X)}$, we have:\n$$f^{(X)} = \\frac{2}{3} (\\Delta E^{(\\infty)} + A\\,X^{-3} + \\dots) (\\mu^{(\\infty)} + B\\,X^{-3} + \\dots)^2$$\n$$f^{(X)} = \\frac{2}{3} (\\Delta E^{(\\infty)} + A\\,X^{-3}) ((\\mu^{(\\infty)})^2 + 2\\mu^{(\\infty)}B\\,X^{-3} + B^2 X^{-6}) + \\dots$$\n$$f^{(X)} = f^{(\\infty)} + \\frac{2}{3} [A(\\mu^{(\\infty)})^2 + 2B\\Delta E^{(\\infty)}\\mu^{(\\infty)}] X^{-3} + O(X^{-6})$$\nThis shows that $f^{(X)}$ also converges with a leading term of $X^{-3}$, so direct extrapolation is, in principle, formally possible. However, the two-point formula is derived by assuming the property follows the two-term model $P^{(X)} = P^{(\\infty)} + C X^{-3}$ *exactly*, which is an algebraic truncation of the true, more complex asymptotic series. The error introduced by this truncation is smaller for the more \"fundamental\" properties $\\Delta E$ and $\\mu$. By forming the product $f^{(X)}$ *before* extrapolation, we create a more complex error structure where higher-order terms from the $\\Delta E$ and $\\mu$ expansions are mixed. Extrapolating the fundamental components first, for which the two-term model is a more physically accurate approximation, and only then constructing the final derived property is a more robust procedure that minimizes the contamination from neglected higher-order terms. This is the standard and theoretically preferred approach in high-accuracy quantum chemistry.\n\nThe final numerical answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f^{(\\infty)} \\approx 0.3776$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3776}$$", "id": "2889070"}]}
