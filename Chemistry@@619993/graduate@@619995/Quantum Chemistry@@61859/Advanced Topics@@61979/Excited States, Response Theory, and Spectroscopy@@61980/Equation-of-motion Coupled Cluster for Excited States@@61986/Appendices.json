The model is a common textbook example for illustrating electron correlation. The language is objective and precise. The critical point for validity is whether the set of provided integrals is complete and consistent for solving the problem. The core of the problem requires constructing the Hamiltonian matrix in the basis $\\{ \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle, \\lvert \\Phi_2 \\rangle \\}$. The matrix elements are $H_{00} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$, $H_{22} = \\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_2 \\rangle$, and $H_{02} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_2 \\rangle$.\n\nA careful derivation of the off-diagonal coupling element, $H_{02}$, is required. The states are Slater determinants: $\\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = (2!)^{-1/2} \\det|i\\alpha(1) i\\beta(2)|$ and $\\lvert \\Phi_2 \\rangle = (2!)^{-1/2} \\det|a\\alpha(1) a\\beta(2)|$.\nThe Hamiltonian operator is $\\hat{H} = \\sum_k \\hat{h}(k) + \\sum_{k<l} r_{kl}^{-1}$.\n$$H_{02} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_2 \\rangle = \\langle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(i\\alpha_1 i\\beta_2 - i\\beta_1 i\\alpha_2) | \\hat{H} | \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a\\alpha_1 a\\beta_2 - a\\beta_1 a\\alpha_2) \\rangle$$\nDue to the orthogonality of spatial orbitals $i$ and $a$, the one-electron part of $\\hat{H}$ does not contribute. The two-electron operator gives:\n$$H_{02} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\langle i\\alpha_1 i\\beta_2 | r_{12}^{-1} | a\\alpha_1 a\\beta_2 \\rangle - \\langle i\\alpha_1 i\\beta_2 | r_{12}^{-1} | a\\beta_1 a\\alpha_2 \\rangle - \\langle i\\beta_1 i\\alpha_2 | r_{12}^{-1} | a\\alpha_1 a\\beta_2 \\rangle + \\langle i\\beta_1 i\\alpha_2 | r_{12}^{-1} | a\\beta_1 a\\alpha_2 \\rangle \\right)$$\nIntegrating over spin coordinates, the second and third terms vanish due to spin orthogonality $(\\langle \\alpha | \\beta \\rangle = 0)$. The first and fourth terms survive.\nThe first term is $\\langle i\\alpha_1 i\\beta_2 | r_{12}^{-1} | a\\alpha_1 a\\beta_2 \\rangle = \\iint \\phi_i^*(1)\\phi_i^*(2) r_{12}^{-1} \\phi_a(1)\\phi_a(2) d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2$. This is an unconventional integral. The derivation must be more careful.\nLet us expand the matrix element:\n$\\langle i\\alpha_1 i\\beta_2 | r_{12}^{-1} | a\\alpha_1 a\\beta_2 \\rangle = \\iint \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha^*(\\sigma_1)\\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\beta^*(\\sigma_2) r_{12}^{-1} \\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(\\sigma_1)\\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\beta(\\sigma_2) d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\sigma_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2 d\\sigma_2$.\nThe spin integral is $\\langle\\alpha|\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\beta|\\beta\\rangle=1$. The spatial integral is $\\iint \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}_1) r_{12}^{-1} \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\phi_a(\\mathbf{r}_2) d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2$.\nAssuming real orbitals, this is $(ia|ia)$ in chemists' (Mulliken) notation. Let's call this integral $K_{ia}$.\nThe fourth term is identical. Thus, $H_{02} = \\frac{1}{2} (K_{ia} + K_{ia}) = K_{ia}$.\nThe provided integral $(ia|ia)=0.2$ is precisely this coupling element. The notation is consistent with standard use in quantum chemistry where this specific matrix element is the exchange-type integral $K_{ia}$. The problem is therefore well-posed and contains all necessary information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\nThe problem is restricted to a two-determinant space, $\\{\\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle, \\lvert \\Phi_2 \\rangle\\}$. The coupled cluster ansatz is $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle = \\exp(\\hat{T})\\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle$. The cluster operator $\\hat{T}$ is truncated at double excitations (CCSD), so $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$.\nThe Brillouin condition is given, which, for canonical HF orbitals, implies that singly excited determinants do not directly couple with the HF reference, $\\langle \\Phi_i^a | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 0$. This leads to the simplification that single excitation amplitudes $t_i^a$ are zero in this model, so $\\hat{T}_1 = 0$.\nThe only possible excitation in the given seniority-zero subspace is the pair excitation from orbital $i$ to orbital $a$. Thus, the only non-zero cluster operator is $\\hat{T}_2$, which has only one component:\n$$ \\hat{T}_2 = t \\, a_{a\\alpha}^\\dagger a_{a\\beta}^\\dagger a_{i\\beta} a_{i\\alpha} $$\nwhere $t$ is the scalar amplitude to be determined. Acting on the reference, this operator generates the doubly excited state: $\\hat{T}_2 \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = t \\lvert \\Phi_2 \\rangle$. Any further application of $\\hat{T}_2$ yields zero, as there are no more electrons in orbital $i$ to excite: $\\hat{T}_2^{n} \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 0$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nThe CC wavefunction is therefore $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle = \\exp(\\hat{T}_2) \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = (1 + \\hat{T}_2) \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle + t \\lvert \\Phi_2 \\rangle$.\nThe CC energy and amplitude equations are derived by projecting the Schrödinger equation, $\\hat{H} e^{\\hat{T}} \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = E e^{\\hat{T}} \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle$, onto the reference and excited determinants. It is convenient to work with the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\\bar{H} = e^{-\\hat{T}} \\hat{H} e^{\\hat{T}}$. The equations are:\nEnergy: $E = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$.\nAmplitude: $\\langle \\Phi_2 | \\bar{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of $\\bar{H}$ is $\\bar{H} = \\hat{H} + [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2] + \\frac{1}{2}[[\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2], \\hat{T}_2] + \\dots$. The expansion terminates at the double commutator because higher-order commutators produce excitations outside our two-determinant space.\nThe energy is $E = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} + [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H}\\hat{T}_2 | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$.\nThe Hartree-Fock energy is $E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$.\nThe correlation energy is $E_{\\mathrm{c}} = E - E_{\\mathrm{HF}} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H}\\hat{T}_2 | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = t \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_2 \\rangle = t H_{02}$.\n\nThe amplitude equation is $\\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{H} + [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2] + \\frac{1}{2}[[\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2], \\hat{T}_2] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 0$.\nLet's evaluate each term:\n1. $\\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = H_{20} = H_{02}$.\n2. $\\langle \\Phi_2 | [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{H}\\hat{T}_2 | \\Phi_0 \\rangle - \\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{T}_2\\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = t\\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_2 \\rangle - t\\langle \\Phi_0 | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = t(H_{22} - H_{00})$.\n3. $\\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\Phi_2 | [[\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2], \\hat{T}_2] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = -\\langle \\Phi_2 | \\hat{T}_2 \\hat{H} \\hat{T}_2 | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = -t^2 H_{02}$.\nThe full amplitude equation is:\n$$H_{02} + t(H_{22} - H_{00}) - t^2 H_{02} = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the amplitude $t$.\n\nNow we compute the Hamiltonian matrix elements using the provided integrals. We assume real orbitals.

The first-order amplitude is $t^{(1)} = H_{02} / (E_0^{(0)}-E_2^{(0)})$. The zeroth-order energy difference is typically $2\\epsilon_i - 2\\epsilon_a < 0$, making $t^{(1)}$ negative. We therefore choose the smaller root, $t_2$.\n$$t = \\frac{2.9 - \\sqrt{8.57}}{0.4} \\approx -0.068640$$\nThe correlation energy is then:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{c}} = t H_{02} \\approx (-0.068640)(0.2) = -0.013728 \\text{ hartree}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $E_{\\mathrm{c}} = -0.01373$ hartree.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.01373}$$", "id": "2889818"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of the ground-state calculation, we now turn to the core of EOM theory: describing the excited states.

We are tasked with finding the matrix representation of this Hamiltonian in the basis of singly excited spin-orbital determinants relative to the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) ground state determinant $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$.\n\nThe RHF reference state is $|\\Phi_0\\rangle = |o\\alpha \\, o\\beta \\rangle$, where $o$ is the occupied bonding spatial molecular orbital.

In practice, $A$ is not formed explicitly; instead, iterative subspace methods are used that require only the action of $A$ on trial vectors.\n\nConsider solving for a few low-lying right eigenpairs of $A$ using a Davidson-type method adapted to non-Hermitian problems as appropriate for EOM-CC with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD). The method constructs a small trial subspace of right vectors $V$ (and, when needed, a left trial subspace $W$), builds a projected problem, and expands the subspaces using preconditioned residuals. The following foundational facts may be used as a starting point:\n\n- A right Ritz pair $(\\theta, \\mathbf{u})$ from a subspace $\\mathcal{K} = \\mathrm{span}\\{V\\}$ satisfies $A \\mathbf{u} - \\theta \\mathbf{u} \\perp \\mathcal{K}$ in the Hermitian case, and more generally the Petrov–Galerkin condition $W^{\\dagger} (A \\mathbf{u} - \\theta \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$ for a left test subspace $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathrm{span}\\{W\\}$.\n- For any trial vector $\\mathbf{v}$, the so-called sigma-vector is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = A \\mathbf{v}$, and the right residual associated with an approximate eigenpair $(\\theta, \\mathbf{v})$ is $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\theta \\mathbf{v}$.\n- A Davidson preconditioner arises by approximating $(A - \\theta I)^{-1}$ with the inverse of a simple diagonal (or block-diagonal) approximation $D - \\theta I$, where $D$ is chosen to be inexpensive to invert.\n\nWithin this context, and keeping in mind that $A$ is non-Hermitian in EOM-CC, select all statements that are correct regarding the construction of the sigma-vector, residual, projection, and preconditioning in a practical non-Hermitian Davidson algorithm for EOM-CCSD:\n\nA. In EOM-CC, the sigma-vector for a right trial vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is computed as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = A \\mathbf{v}$, where $A$ represents the action of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H}$ in the excitation space. In EOM-CCSD, this action is evaluated without forming $A$ explicitly by contracting $\\bar{H}$ with $\\mathbf{v}$ using the connected operator structure. The corresponding right residual for a Ritz value $\\theta$ is $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\theta \\mathbf{v}$.\n\nB. Because $\\bar{H}$ is related to a Hermitian Hamiltonian by a similarity transformation, projecting the problem onto the same right subspace $\\mathcal{K} = \\mathrm{span}\\{V\\}$ (Galerkin projection with $W=V$) is sufficient to guarantee real Ritz values and convergence, so maintaining a left subspace is unnecessary in the non-Hermitian EOM-CC setting.\n\nC. In a bi-orthogonal Davidson scheme for non-Hermitian EOM-CC, one maintains right and left subspaces $V$ and $W$ such that $W^{\\dagger} V = I$. The projected matrix is $H_{\\mathrm{proj}} = W^{\\dagger} A V$. Solving $H_{\\mathrm{proj}} \\mathbf{y} = \\theta \\mathbf{y}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{proj}}^{\\dagger} \\mathbf{z} = \\bar{\\theta} \\mathbf{z}$ yields Ritz vectors $\\mathbf{u} = V \\mathbf{y}$ and $\\mathbf{l} = W \\mathbf{z}$, with residuals $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = A \\mathbf{u} - \\theta \\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{L} = A^{\\dagger} \\mathbf{l} - \\bar{\\theta} \\mathbf{l}$. New right search directions are obtained by approximately solving $(D - \\theta I) \\Delta \\mathbf{u} \\approx \\mathbf{r}_{R}$, where $D$ is an easily inverted diagonal approximation to $A$.\n\nD. In EOM-CCSD practice, a widely used choice for the diagonal preconditioner $D$ is built from orbital energy differences consistent with Møller–Plesset denominators: for single excitations $a \\leftarrow i$, one uses $D_{ai,ai} \\approx \\varepsilon_{a} - \\varepsilon_{i}$, and for double excitations $ab \\leftarrow ij$, one uses $D_{abij,abij} \\approx \\varepsilon_{a} + \\varepsilon_{b} - \\varepsilon_{i} - \\varepsilon_{j}$. This choice remains effective despite the non-Hermiticity of $A$.\n\nE. Since $\\bar{H}$ is non-Hermitian, its left and right eigenvectors are automatically orthonormal under the standard inner product, eliminating the need for bi-orthogonalization; furthermore, the correct right residual in Davidson must be computed as $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\theta \\mathbf{v}$ to ensure contraction by the preconditioner.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   The theory is equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) for excited states.\n-   The eigenvalue problem concerns the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^{T}$, where $T$ is the ground-state cluster operator.\n-   The problem is projected into an excitation manifold.\n-   $A$ is the effective non-Hermitian operator acting on excitation amplitudes.\n-   The right and left eigenvalue problems are $A \\mathbf{r} = \\omega \\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathbf{l}^{\\dagger} A = \\omega \\mathbf{l}^{\\dagger}$, respectively, for excitation energy $\\omega$.\n-   In practice, $A$ is not formed explicitly; iterative methods use its action on trial vectors.\n-   The context is solving for a few low-lying right eigenpairs of $A$ using a Davidson-type method for EOM-CCSD.\n-   A right Ritz pair $(\\theta, \\mathbf{u})$ from a subspace $\\mathcal{K} = \\mathrm{span}\\{V\\}$ satisfies the Petrov–Galerkin condition $W^{\\dagger} (A \\mathbf{u} - \\theta \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$ for a left test subspace $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathrm{span}\\{W\\}$.\n-   The sigma-vector for a trial vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = A \\mathbf{v}$.\n-   The right residual for an approximate eigenpair $(\\theta, \\mathbf{v})$ is $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\theta \\mathbf{v}$.\n-   A Davidson preconditioner approximates $(A - \\theta I)^{-1}$ with $(D - \\theta I)^{-1}$, where $D$ is an easily invertible approximation to $A$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes the standard theoretical and computational framework for determining excited states via the EOM-CCSD method. All provided definitions and concepts are scientifically sound and central to modern quantum chemistry.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The definition of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H}$, the resulting non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem for the effective operator $A$, and the distinction between right and left eigenvectors are all fundamental tenets of EOM-CC theory.

A full solution will be derived by evaluating each provided option.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires an assessment of statements related to the practical implementation of the non-Hermitian Davidson algorithm for EOM-CCSD.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\nThis statement describes the computation of the sigma-vector and the residual. The sigma-vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = A\\mathbf{v}$, represents the action of the effective Hamiltonian $A$ on a trial excitation vector $\\mathbf{v}$. In EOM-CC, $A$ is indeed the representation of $\\bar{H}$ in the basis of single, double, etc., excitations. Due to its enormous size, the matrix $A$ is not constructed explicitly. Instead, its action is computed \"on the fly\" by evaluating the contractions of the trial vector's amplitudes with the operator terms arising from $\\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^{T}$. This procedure is computationally intensive but avoids the storage of $A$. The right residual vector for an approximate eigenpair $(\\theta, \\mathbf{v})$ is defined as the deviation from the eigenvalue equation, $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = A\\mathbf{v} - \\theta\\mathbf{v} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\theta\\mathbf{v}$. This measures how close the trial pair is to being an exact eigenpair. Every part of this statement is a correct description of the standard EOM-CCSD algorithm.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B Analysis**\nThis statement claims that a simple Galerkin projection ($W=V$) is sufficient because $\\bar{H}$ is related to a Hermitian operator $H$ by a similarity transformation. This is fundamentally incorrect. A similarity transformation $A = S^{-1} H S$ where $H$ is Hermitian and $S$ is not unitary does *not* preserve Hermiticity. The operator $\\bar{H}$ in coupled cluster theory is notoriously non-Hermitian because the cluster operator $T$ leads to a non-unitary transformation $e^T$. The eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian matrix are not guaranteed to be real, and its eigenvectors are not orthogonal. A Galerkin projection for a non-Hermitian problem, which yields the projected matrix $V^{\\dagger} A V$, can suffer from instability and may fail to converge or converge to spurious solutions. A robust algorithm must respect the non-Hermitian nature of the problem, which typically necessitates a Petrov-Galerkin condition with distinct left and right trial subspaces ($W \\neq V$). The claim that maintaining a left subspace is unnecessary is false and would lead to a numerically unstable method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C Analysis**\nThis statement describes a bi-orthogonal Davidson scheme. For non-Hermitian problems, maintaining separate left and right trial subspaces, $W$ and $V$ respectively, is the foundation of robust methods like the bi-orthogonal Lanczos/Arnoldi algorithms, upon which the non-Hermitian Davidson method is built. The condition $W^{\\dagger} V = I$ ensures the two bases are bi-orthogonal, which simplifies the projection. The projected matrix is correctly given by the Petrov-Galerkin scheme as $H_{\\mathrm{proj}} = W^{\\dagger} A V$. Solving the small eigenvalue problems for this projected matrix, $H_{\\mathrm{proj}} \\mathbf{y} = \\theta \\mathbf{y}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{proj}}^{\\dagger} \\mathbf{z} = \\bar{\\theta} \\mathbf{z}$, correctly yields the coefficients for the right and left Ritz vectors, $\\mathbf{u} = V \\mathbf{y}$ and $\\mathbf{l} = W \\mathbf{z}$. The definitions of the right residual $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = A \\mathbf{u} - \\theta \\mathbf{u}$ and left residual $\\mathbf{r}_{L} = A^{\\dagger} \\mathbf{l} - \\bar{\\theta} \\mathbf{l}$ are correct. Finally, the Davidson preconditioning step for the right vector, $(D - \\theta I) \\Delta \\mathbf{u} \\approx \\mathbf{r}_{R}$, where $D$ approximates $A$, is the defining feature of the method, used to generate a correction vector to expand the subspace $V$. This statement provides an accurate, albeit condensed, summary of the bi-orthogonal Davidson algorithm.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D Analysis**\nThis statement proposes a specific form for the diagonal preconditioner $D$. In many-body theories, the diagonal of the Hamiltonian or effective Hamiltonian matrix is often dominated by the sum and difference of one-particle energies (e.g., orbital energies). This is the basis of Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. For EOM-CCSD, the matrix $A$ in the basis of single ($a \\leftarrow i$) and double ($ab \\leftarrow ij$) excitations has diagonal elements that are well approximated by $A_{ia,ia} \\approx \\varepsilon_a - \\varepsilon_i$ and $A_{ij,ab,ij,ab} \\approx \\varepsilon_a + \\varepsilon_b - \\varepsilon_i - \\varepsilon_j$. Here, $\\varepsilon_p$ represents the energy of orbital $p$. This diagonal matrix is trivial to construct and invert. Despite the non-Hermitian nature of $A$ (arising from off-diagonal elements), this diagonal approximation has proven to be a very effective and computationally inexpensive preconditioner in practice, accelerating convergence significantly. The statement accurately reflects standard practice in high-performance quantum chemistry software.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option E Analysis**\nThis statement makes two claims, both of which are fundamentally wrong. First, it asserts that left and right eigenvectors of a non-Hermitian matrix are \"automatically orthonormal\". This is false. For a non-Hermitian operator $A$, the set of right eigenvectors $\\{\\mathbf{r}_i\\}$ is generally not orthogonal, nor is the set of left eigenvectors $\\{\\mathbf{l}_i\\}$. Instead, the left and right eigenvectors form a bi-orthogonal set, meaning $\\mathbf{l}_i^{\\dagger} \\mathbf{r}_j \\propto \\delta_{ij}$. The need for bi-orthogonalization is a direct consequence of non-Hermiticity, not eliminated by it. Second, it claims the residual should be $\\mathbf{r}_{R} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\theta \\mathbf{v}$. The objective is to solve $A\\mathbf{v} = \\theta\\mathbf{v}$. The residual must quantify the error in this equation, which is $A\\mathbf{v} - \\theta\\mathbf{v}$. The proposed form with a plus sign is nonsensical and has no connection to the eigenvalue problem being solved.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2889838"}]}
