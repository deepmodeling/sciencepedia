This indicates that the hole created by ionization corresponds perfectly to a single spin-orbital.\n\nDeviations of $S^{(k)}$ from $1$ are a direct manifestation of electron correlation and the breakdown of this simple one-particle picture.\n1.  **Ground-state correlation ($t \\ne 0$) and biorthogonality ($\\ell \\ne 0$):** The factor $(1-\\ell t)$ appears in $d_{o_\\alpha}^{(k)}$, showing that both the multiconfigurational character of the ground state (via $t$) and the asymmetry between the left and right CC states (via $\\ell$) diminish the overlap with a simple one-hole picture.\n2.  **Shake-up character in the ionized state ($r_{oo}^{v,(k)} \\ne 0$):** In a correlated system, ionization from one orbital can simultaneously cause an excitation of another electron (a \"shake-up\" process). This is captured by the $r_{oo}^{v,(k)}$ amplitude, which describes the $2h1p$ component of the ionized state. Consequently, the total intensity of the primary one-hole removal is distributed among multiple final states. State $k=1$ is predominantly a one-hole state ($(r_o^{(1)})^2=0.81$), but its norm $S^{(1)} \\approx 0.70$ is less than $1$ due to both correlation effects and sharing intensity with other states. State $k=2$ is a \"satellite\" peak, being mostly of shake-up character ($(r_{oo}^{v,(2)})^2=0.81$), and it \"borrows\" the remaining intensity, having $S^{(2)} \\approx 0.21$. The fact that $S^{(k)}<1$ is thus a quantitative measure of how much the ionization process deviates from the simple removal of an electron from a single mean-field orbital.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7049 & 0.2132 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2632902"}, {"introduction": "While analytical models provide deep insight, practical quantum chemistry relies on computational algorithms that can handle general, many-electron wavefunctions.

An electron must be present in spin-orbital $r$ within determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{I} \\rangle$ (i.e., the bit $I_r$ must be $1$), and the final determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{J} \\rangle$ must be identical to $\\lvert \\Phi_{I} \\rangle$ but with an electron removed from spin-orbital $r$. This means the bitstring $J$ is obtained from $I$ by flipping the bit at position $r$ from $1$ to $0$. We denote this resulting bitstring as $I\\setminus r$. The value of this non-zero matrix element is the fermionic sign, $(-1)^{p(I,r)}$, where $p(I,r)$ is the number of occupied spin-orbitals with an index less than $r$ in the determinant $\\lvert \\Phi_{I} \\rangle$.\n\nThese conditions collapse the double summation over $I$ and $J$ into a single sum over the determinants $I$ that contribute to the $\\lvert \\Psi_N \\rangle$ expansion and have the spin-orbital $r$ occupied. This yields the formula provided in the problem statement:\n$$\nA_{0}(r) = \\sum_{I:\\, I_{r}=1} C^{(N)}_{I}\\, C^{(N-1,0)}_{I\\setminus r}\\, (-1)^{p(I,r)}\n$$\nNote that if a required determinant $I\\setminus r$ is not explicitly listed in the expansion of $\\lvert \\Psi_{N-1}^{0} \\rangle$, its coefficient $C^{(N-1,0)}_{I\\setminus r}$ is taken to be zero, and that term does not contribute to the sum.\n\nOnce $A_{0}(r)$ is calculated, the spectroscopic factor $Z_{k=0}(r)$ is its squared modulus:\n$$\nZ_{0}(r) = \\lvert A_{0}(r) \\rvert^{2}\n$$\nFinally, the absolute deviation $\\Delta$ from the experimental intensity $I_{\\text{exp}}$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\lvert Z_{0}(r) - I_{\\text{exp}} \\rvert\n$$\nThis procedure is applied systematically to each test case.

Consider the first determinant, $I_1 = \"111000\"$, with coefficient $C^{(N)}_{I_1} = \\sqrt{0.85}$. The bit at index $r=2$ is '1', so this term contributes.\n- The prefix is \"11\", so the number of occupied orbitals before index $2$ is $p(I_1, 2) = 2$. The sign is $(-1)^{2} = +1$.\n- The target determinant in the $(N-1)$-electron space is $I_1\\setminus 2 = \"110000\"$. We look up this determinant in the expansion of $\\lvert \\Psi_{N-1}^{0} \\rangle$. It is present with coefficient $C^{(N-1,0)}_{\"110000\"} = \\sqrt{0.90}$.\n- The contribution from this term is $(\\sqrt{0.85}) \\times (\\sqrt{0.90}) \\times (+1) = \\sqrt{0.765}$.\n\n$2$. Consider the second determinant, $I_2 = \"110100\"$.

The question is to use first principles and the diagnostics provided to decide when the orbital-energy-based estimate will be reliable or fail.\n\nFoundational base:\n- The vertical first ionization energy is defined as $I(M) = E_{N-1}(M^{+}) - E_{N}(M)$, the difference in many-electron total energies between the $(N-1)$-electron cation and the $N$-electron neutral at the neutral geometry.\n- In independent-particle approximations, the removal of an electron from an occupied orbital leads to a one-hole state. The Dyson orbital $\\psi_{\\mathrm{D}}(\\mathbf{r})$ for a specific final ionic state $\\ket{\\Psi_{N-1}^{\\alpha}}$ is defined by the overlap amplitude between the $N$-electron neutral $\\ket{\\Psi_{N}}$ and the $(N-1)$-electron cation, with norm (spectroscopic factor) $Z_{\\alpha} = \\int \\lvert \\psi_{\\mathrm{D}}^{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}) \\rvert^{2}\\, d\\mathbf{r}$.

For Channel V, the combination of high $Z_{\\mathrm{V}}$, near-idempotent NOONs with small $T_{1}$, and very small $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{V}}$ indicates a dominant one-hole character with weak correlation and minimal deviation from piecewise linearity, so orbital-energy-based Koopmans-type estimates should be accurate. For Channel IV, the small $Z_{\\mathrm{IV}}$ and large $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{IV}}$ signal strong shake-up and deviation from piecewise linearity, so Koopmans-type estimates are expected to fail.\n\nB.

All definitions and concepts are standard and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a set of diagnostic data for two distinct physical scenarios (a \"well-behaved\" valence ionization and a \"pathological\" inner-valence ionization) and asks for an interpretation based on first principles.

It is a valid, well-constructed problem that tests the understanding of advanced concepts in electronic structure theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe reliability of an orbital-energy-based estimate for ionization energy, $I_k \\approx -\\varepsilon_k$, depends on the underlying theoretical framework (Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham DFT) and the physical nature of the ionization process.\n\nIn Hartree-Fock theory, Koopmans' theorem ($I_k \\approx -\\varepsilon_k^{\\text{HF}}$) is an approximation that neglects two key physical effects:\n$1$. **Orbital Relaxation**: The remaining $N-1$ electrons redistribute in response to the removal of one electron. This lowers the energy of the cation, meaning the true $I_k$ is lower than $-\\varepsilon_k^{\\text{HF}}$. The relaxation error, $E_{\\text{relax}} > 0$, makes the Koopmans estimate too large.\n$2$. **Electron Correlation**: HF theory neglects electron correlation. The total correlation energy is more negative for the $N$-electron neutral than for the $(N-1)$-electron cation. This effect increases the energy difference, meaning the true $I_k$ is higher than the HF prediction. The correlation error, $\\Delta E_{\\text{corr}} < 0$, makes the Koopmans estimate too small.\nThe accuracy of the HF Koopmans estimate hinges on a fortuitous cancellation of these two opposing errors: $I_k = -\\varepsilon_k^{\\text{HF}} - E_{\\text{relax}} - \\Delta E_{\\text{corr}}$.\n\nIn Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory, for the exact exchange-correlation (XC) functional, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) eigenvalue is exactly the negative of the first ionization energy: $I = -\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}^{\\text{KS}}$. This is a consequence of the total energy $E(N)$ being a piecewise linear function of the number of electrons $N$. For approximate XC functionals, $E(N)$ is typically a smooth, convex function, a manifestation of delocalization or self-interaction error. The curvature $\\kappa$ quantifies this deviation. A small $\\kappa$ suggests the functional approximates the piecewise linearity condition well, and thus $-\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}^{\\text{KS}}$ will be a good approximation to $I$. For inner-valence orbitals, a similar condition on the derivative of the energy with respect to orbital occupation number must hold, and $\\kappa$ remains a valid measure of the quality of the orbital energy as an estimate for the corresponding ionization.\n\nThe Dyson spectroscopic factor, $Z$, probes the validity of the single-particle picture itself. If $Z \\approx 1$, the ionic state is well-described by removing an electron from a single orbital of the neutral system. This implies that correlation effects that mix the single-hole configuration with excited configurations (like $2h1p$, or \"shake-up\" states) are weak. If $Z \\ll 1$, the single-particle picture breaks down; the true ionic state is a strong mixture of multiple configurations, and the concept of ionizing an electron \"from\" a single orbital loses its meaning. In this case, no method based on a single-determinant description of the final state (including both Koopmans' theorem and $\\Delta$SCF) can be accurate.\n\nAnalysis based on provided diagnostics:\n- **Channel V**: $Z_{\\mathrm{V}} = 0.90$ is close to $1$, indicating a clean one-electron process. The neutral state is well-behaved (small $T_1$, idempotent NOONs). The curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{V}} = 0.03\\,\\text{eV}$ is very small, indicating that DFT with a suitable functional will give a KS eigenvalue very close to the true $I$. For HF, the clean one-hole nature of the final state suggests that the correlation error part ($\\Delta E_{\\text{corr}}$) is small, and for valence orbitals, the relaxation energy ($E_{\\text{relax}}$) is also typically modest. Therefore, a good cancellation is plausible. All signs point to a reliable Koopmans-type estimate.\n- **Channel IV**: $Z_{\\mathrm{IV}} = 0.40$ is very far from $1$. This indicates a catastrophic breakdown of the single-particle picture. The EOM-IP-CCSD analysis confirms this with \"strong $2h1p$ admixture\". The ionization intensity is split among multiple final states. An orbital energy, which is a single number, cannot possibly describe this complex manifold. The large curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{IV}} = 0.25\\,\\text{eV}$ further confirms that even in a DFT framework, the KS eigenvalue will be a poor predictor. Koopmans-type estimates are guaranteed to fail.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n**A. For Channel V, the combination of high $Z_{\\mathrm{V}}$, near-idempotent NOONs with small $T_{1}$, and very small $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{V}}$ indicates a dominant one-hole character with weak correlation and minimal deviation from piecewise linearity, so orbital-energy-based Koopmans-type estimates should be accurate. For Channel IV, the small $Z_{\\mathrm{IV}}$ and large $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{IV}}$ signal strong shake-up and deviation from piecewise linearity, so Koopmans-type estimates are expected to fail.**\nThis option correctly synthesizes all the provided information. For Channel V, it correctly associates the high spectroscopic factor and small DFT curvature with a well-behaved ionization process where a Koopmans-type estimate is reliable. For Channel IV, it correctly identifies the small spectroscopic factor (shake-up) and large DFT curvature as definitive indicators of the failure of any single-particle orbital energy estimate. The reasoning is sound and complete.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A high Dyson spectroscopic factor $Z \\approx 1$ guarantees that orbital relaxation is negligible, so Koopmans-type estimates must be accurate regardless of NOONs, $T_{1}$, or $\\kappa$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A high spectroscopic factor $Z \\approx 1$ indicates that the final state is predominantly a single-hole state relative to the reference wave function, which implies that electron correlation effects *in the change between states* (i.e., shake-up) are small. It does not provide any information about the magnitude of orbital relaxation, which is a mean-field effect describing the response of the other electrons. For deep core ionizations, relaxation energy can be very large (tens of eV) even when $Z \\approx 1$. Thus, a high $Z$ does not guarantee a small relaxation energy nor the overall accuracy of the Koopmans estimate, which depends on the cancellation of relaxation and correlation errors.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Small fractional-charge curvature $\\kappa \\approx 0$ implies that the highest occupied KS eigenvalue should closely approximate the vertical ionization energy for that channel in DFT; however, it does not guarantee that the corresponding HF orbital energy will be accurate if correlation and relaxation contributions are sizable. Therefore, curvature alone is insufficient to predict the accuracy of the HF-based Koopmans estimate.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate description of the situation. The curvature $\\kappa$ is a diagnostic specifically for DFT, quantifying the deviation from the exact condition under which $-\\varepsilon_{\\text{KS}}$ equals the ionization energy. A small $\\kappa$ is a strong indicator of success for a DFT orbital energy estimate. However, Hartree-Fock theory is a completely different method. Its accuracy depends on the cancellation between relaxation and correlation errors. The DFT-based $\\kappa$ diagnostic has no direct implication for the magnitude of these two errors in an HF calculation. The conclusion that $\\kappa$ is insufficient to predict the accuracy for HF is therefore correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. A large $T_{1}$ diagnostic for the neutral state always implies Koopmans failure for every ionization channel, while a small $T_{1}$ ensures Koopmans success for every channel.**\nThis statement makes a universal claim that is false. The first part is largely true: a large $T_1$ indicates strong multireference character in the neutral ground state, which is a poor starting point for a single-determinant-based theory like HF, so Koopmans' theorem is expected to fail. The second part, however, is demonstrably false. A small $T_1$ indicates that the neutral ground state is well-described by a single determinant. However, the accuracy of a Koopmans estimate also depends on the nature of the final cationic state. The provided Channel IV is a perfect counterexample: the neutral has a small $T_1$ ($0.018$), yet the ionization process fails the Koopmans prediction catastrophically due to strong correlation effects in the cation (as shown by $Z_{\\mathrm{IV}} = 0.40$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For an inner-valence ionization with $Z \\approx 0.4$, the dominant source of Koopmans error is missing orbital relaxation; thus, a $\\Delta$ Self-Consistent Field ($\\Delta$SCF) calculation will recover accuracy even when there is strong $2h1p$ character in the cationic state.**\nThis statement contains flawed reasoning. A spectroscopic factor of $Z \\approx 0.4$ is a definitive sign of the breakdown of the single-particle picture due to strong electron correlation, leading to a multiconfigurational final ionic state (strong $2h1p$ mixing). This correlation effect is the dominant source of error. A $\\Delta$SCF calculation, which computes the energy difference between separate SCF calculations for the neutral and cation, correctly accounts for orbital relaxation but remains a single-determinant method. As such, it is fundamentally incapable of describing the multiconfigurational nature of the final state. It will not \"recover accuracy\" when strong shake-up ($Z \\ll 1$) is present.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2901825"}]}
