A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the generalized eigenvalue equation:\n$$\nS z = \\omega \\eta z\n$$\nHere, $S$ is a Hermitian matrix ($S^\\dagger = S$) and is also positive-definite, meaning for any non-zero vector $z$, the expectation value $z^\\dagger S z$ is a positive real number: $z^\\dagger S z  0$. The metric $\\eta$ is also Hermitian ($\\eta^\\dagger = \\eta$) and satisfies $\\eta^2 = I_{2M}$.\n\nLet $z_i$ and $z_j$ be two eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues $\\omega_i$ and $\\omega_j$, respectively:\n$$\nS z_i = \\omega_i \\eta z_i\n$$\n$$\nS z_j = \\omega_j \\eta z_j\n$$\nTaking the Hermitian conjugate of the first equation gives:\n$$\n(S z_i)^\\dagger = (\\omega_i \\eta z_i)^\\dagger \\implies z_i^\\dagger S^\\dagger = \\omega_i^* z_i^\\dagger \\eta^\\dagger\n$$\nSince $S$ and $\\eta$ are Hermitian, this simplifies to:\n$$\nz_i^\\dagger S = \\omega_i^* z_i^\\dagger \\eta\n$$\nNow, we left-multiply the equation for $z_j$ by $z_i^\\dagger$ and the conjugated equation for $z_i$ by $z_j$:\n$$\nz_i^\\dagger S z_j = \\omega_j z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j\n$$\n$$\nz_i^\\dagger S z_j = \\omega_i^* z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j\n$$\nEquating the right-hand sides yields an orthogonality relation:\n$$\n\\omega_j z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j = \\omega_i^* z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j \\implies (\\omega_j - \\omega_i^*) (z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j) = 0\n$$\nThis result suggests that the quantity $z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j$ serves as a natural inner product for this problem. Let us define this inner product as $\\langle z_i, z_j \\rangle_\\eta \\equiv z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_j$. The problem asks for an inner product that is conserved by the linearized dynamics. The time evolution of the response vector is governed by $i\\frac{d}{dt}z = \\eta S z$. The evolution operator $U(t) = \\exp(-i \\eta S t)$ can be shown to be pseudo-unitary with respect to the metric $\\eta$, i.e., $U^\\dagger \\eta U = \\eta$. This directly implies that the inner product $\\langle z_1, z_2 \\rangle_\\eta = z_1^\\dagger \\eta z_2$ is conserved over time.\n\nSubstituting the block forms of $z_i = \\begin{pmatrix} X_i \\\\ Y_i \\end{pmatrix}$, $z_j = \\begin{pmatrix} X_j \\\\ Y_j \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\eta$, the inner product is:\n$$\n\\langle z_i, z_j \\rangle_\\eta = \\begin{pmatrix} X_i^\\dagger  Y_i^\\dagger \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} I_M  0 \\\\ 0  -I_M \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X_j \\\\ Y_j \\end{pmatrix} = X_i^\\dagger X_j - Y_i^\\dagger Y_j\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the normalization condition. Consider the case where $i = j$. The orthogonality relation becomes $(\\omega_i - \\omega_i^*) (z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i) = 0$. The quantity $z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i = X_i^\\dagger X_i - Y_i^\\dagger Y_i$ is the \"norm\" of the eigenvector $z_i$ in this indefinite metric. From the positive-definiteness of $S$, we know that $z_i^\\dagger S z_i  0$ for any non-zero eigenvector $z_i$. Using the eigenvalue equation, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\nz_i^\\dagger S z_i = z_i^\\dagger (\\omega_i \\eta z_i) = \\omega_i (z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i)\n$$\nCombining these facts, we have:\n$$\n\\omega_i (z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i)  0\n$$\nSince $S$ is positive-definite, it can be proven that all eigenvalues $\\omega_i^2$ are positive and real, which means all $\\omega_i$ are real and non-zero (for a stable system with non-trivial excitations). Thus, the previous relationship implies that the sign of the eigenvalue $\\omega_i$ must be the same as the sign of the norm $z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega_i) = \\operatorname{sgn}(z_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i) = \\operatorname{sgn}(X_i^\\dagger X_i - Y_i^\\dagger Y_i)\n$$\nA standard and convenient normalization choice is to set the norm to $\\pm 1$:\n$$\nz_i^\\dagger \\eta z_i = X_i^\\dagger X_i - Y_i^\\dagger Y_i = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega_i)\n$$\nThis means that for excitation modes with positive frequency ($\\omega_i  0$), the norm is normalized to $+1$. For de-excitation modes with negative frequency ($\\omega_i  0$), the norm is normalized to $-1$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The inner product is $\\big\\langle (X,Y), (X',Y') \\big\\rangle \\equiv X^\\dagger X' - Y^\\dagger Y'$, and the normalization is $X^\\dagger X - Y^\\dagger Y = +1$ for $\\omega  0$ and $-1$ for $\\omega  0$. This perfectly matches our derived results for both the inner product and the normalization condition. The conclusion that partners at $\\pm\\omega$ have opposite norms is also a direct consequence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. This option proposes the standard Euclidean inner product $X^\\dagger X' + Y^\\dagger Y'$ and normalization $X^\\dagger X + Y^\\dagger Y = 1$. This is incorrect because the orthogonality and conservation properties are governed by the metric $\\eta$, not the identity matrix. This choice of normalization also fails to distinguish between positive and negative frequency solutions, which is a key physical feature of the RPA problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. This option suggests a skew-symmetric form $X^\\dagger Y' - Y^\\dagger X'$. While the RPA equations possess a symplectic structure for which such forms are relevant, the problem is posed as a generalized Hermitian eigenvalue problem. The inner product consistent with this formulation is $z^\\dagger \\eta z'$, not the one proposed. The normalization condition is also inconsistent with the one derived from the positive-definiteness of $S$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. This option uses an off-diagonal metric $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  I \\\\ I  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for the inner product. This is inconsistent with the metric $\\eta = \\begin{pmatrix} I  0 \\\\ 0  -I \\end{pmatrix}$ which defines the generalized eigenvalue problem. The properties of the eigenvectors, such as orthogonality and normalization, are intrinsically tied to the metric used in the eigenproblem itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. This option claims that all physical modes have zero norm, $X^\\dagger X - Y^\\dagger Y = 0$. As shown in our derivation, $\\omega (X^\\dagger X - Y^\\dagger Y)  0$. If the norm were zero, this inequality could not hold for any non-zero frequency $\\omega$. Zero-norm modes can exist (e.g., as spurious Goldstone modes), but physical excitations at a stable Hartree-Fock minimum have non-zero frequencies and therefore must have non-zero norms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{A}}$$", "id": "2808330"}]}
