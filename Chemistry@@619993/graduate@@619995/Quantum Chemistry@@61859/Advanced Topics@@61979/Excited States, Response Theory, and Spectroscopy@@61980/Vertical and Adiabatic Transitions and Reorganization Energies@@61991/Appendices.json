It provides a standard, formal framework from quantum chemistry to analyze the relationship between vertical and adiabatic electronic transitions. The definitions and premises are self-contained and sufficient for a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the vertical excitation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{vert}}$, equals the adiabatic excitation energy, $E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$. We begin with the provided definitions:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{vert}} \\equiv E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{g}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{adi}} \\equiv E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{g}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$$\nHere, $E_{g}(\\mathbf{R})$ and $E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})$ are the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces (PESs), respectively, as functions of the mass-weighted nuclear coordinates $\\mathbf{R}$. The point $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium geometry of the ground state, and $\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium geometry of the excited state.\n\nSetting $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ yields:\n$$E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{g}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{g}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$$\nThe term $E_{g}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$ cancels from both sides, leaving the condition:\n$$E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$$\nBy definition, $\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the location of the minimum on the excited-state PES, $E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})$. This means that for any coordinate $\\mathbf{R} \\neq \\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$, the energy $E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}) > E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$ (assuming a unique, non-degenerate minimum in the local region of interest, as implied by the problem statement: \"well-defined local minimum\"). The equality $E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$ can therefore only be satisfied if the ground-state equilibrium geometry is identical to the excited-state equilibrium geometry, that is:\n$$\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\nThis is a necessary and sufficient geometric condition.\n\nWe can express this geometric condition in terms of the properties of the PES. An equilibrium geometry (a minimum of the PES) is a point where the gradient of the potential energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates is zero. By definition of $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E_{g}(\\mathbf{R})\\rvert_{\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\mathbf{0}$$\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})\\rvert_{\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nThe condition $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is therefore equivalent to stating that the gradient of the excited-state PES must be zero when evaluated at the ground-state equilibrium geometry:\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})\\rvert_{\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nThis is the necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the properties of the excited-state PES.\n\nNow, we analyze the mechanistic implications. According to the problem statement, the nuclear force is the negative gradient of the potential energy, $\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E(\\mathbf{R})$. Immediately following a vertical excitation, the molecule is at the Franck-Condon point, with nuclear coordinates $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The initial force experienced by the nuclei on the excited-state PES is:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_{e}(\\text{initial}) = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})\\rvert_{\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}}$$\nIf the condition for $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ is met, then $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})\\rvert_{\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\mathbf{0}$, which means the initial force is zero: $\\mathbf{F}_{e}(\\text{initial}) = \\mathbf{0}$. A zero net force on the nuclei implies there is no driving force for structural relaxation.\n\nFinally, consider the excited-state reorganization energy, which is defined as the energy drop upon nuclear relaxation on the excited-state surface: $E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}})$. If the condition $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ holds, then this difference is manifestly zero:\n$$E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) - E_{e}(\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}) = 0$$\nThis is consistent: no driving force for relaxation means no energy is released upon relaxation.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA. In the BO and harmonic neighborhoods of $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ if and only if the excited-state nuclear gradient vanishes at the ground-state equilibrium geometry, i.e., $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{R}} E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})\\rvert_{\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\mathbf{0}$, equivalently the excited- and ground-state minima coincide at $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$. Mechanistically, this means the excited state exerts no initial nuclear force at the Franck–Condon point, so there is no driving force for structural relaxation and the excited-state reorganization energy is zero.\nThis statement is perfectly aligned with our derivation. It correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the gradient and the coincidence of minima. It also correctly describes the mechanistic consequences: zero initial force, no driving force for relaxation, and zero reorganization energy. **Correct**.\n\nB. $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ whenever the excited- and ground-state harmonic curvatures (Hessians) are identical at $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$, regardless of the excited-state gradient at that point. Mechanistically, equal curvatures guarantee zero reorganization energy even if the excited-state minimum is displaced.\nThis is incorrect. The curvature (Hessian, or matrix of second derivatives) determines the shape of the potential well, not its position. Two PESs can have identical curvatures but be centered at different geometries ($\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}} \\neq \\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$). If the minima are displaced, then $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$, and the reorganization energy is non-zero. The statement that the gradient is irrelevant is a direct contradiction of the correct condition. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ in the Condon limit where the electronic transition dipole is independent of $\\mathbf{R}$. Mechanistically, the lack of coordinate dependence in the transition moment eliminates vibronic coupling and therefore removes excited-state nuclear forces at $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\nThis is incorrect. The Condon approximation concerns the transition probability (intensity), which depends on the transition dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{ge}(\\mathbf{R})$. The energies of the states are determined by the PESs, $E_{g}(\\mathbf{R})$ and $E_{e}(\\mathbf{R})$. A constant $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{ge}$ does not imply that the PES minima $\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ coincide. The forces are given by the gradient of the PES, not the gradient of the transition dipole moment. One can have a large geometric relaxation (non-zero force) even when the Condon approximation is excellent. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ if and only if the Duschinsky rotation is zero and all normal-mode frequencies are identical in the two states. Mechanistically, in that case normal-mode displacements do not change the energy difference, so the reorganization energy vanishes even if the excited-state minimum is shifted.\nThis is incorrect. Zero Duschinsky rotation and identical frequencies mean the normal modes and their force constants are the same in both states. This is a condition on the Hessians of the two PESs being equal (when expressed in the same coordinate system). Like option B, this addresses the shape of the potentials, not the relative position of their minima. If the excited-state minimum is shifted ($\\mathbf{R}_{g}^{\\mathrm{eq}} \\neq \\mathbf{R}_{e}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$), the reorganization energy will be non-zero, and thus $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$. The mechanistic explanation is internally contradictory. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $E_{\\mathrm{vert}} = E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$ in the limit of ultrafast excitation where nuclei are frozen during the photon absorption. Mechanistically, because nuclear motion does not occur during the transition, there is no energy released by excited-state relaxation and therefore no difference between vertical and adiabatic energies.\nThis is incorrect. The \"frozen nuclei\" approximation is the foundation of the Franck-Condon principle, which defines the vertical transition itself. It is a premise for defining $E_{\\mathrm{vert}}$, not a special condition under which $E_{\\mathrm{vert}}$ equals $E_{\\mathrm{adi}}$. The key physical process distinguishing these two energies is the relaxation that occurs *after* the ultrafast excitation. The statement conflates the event of absorption with the subsequent evolution of the system. The lack of nuclear motion *during* the transition does not preclude nuclear motion *after* the transition, which is what gives rise to the reorganization energy. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2935454"}, {"introduction": "With the conceptual framework in place, we now turn to a practical computational exercise common in the study of electron transfer reactions.

We are asked to compute this quantity using two independent methods and assess their consistency.\n\nFirst, we compute the reorganization energy from the four provided single-point electronic energies. The fundamental definitions for the forward and backward inner-sphere reorganization energies are based on vertical transitions on the potential energy surfaces (PES) of the reduced ($R$) and oxidized ($O$) states.\n\nThe forward inner-sphere reorganization energy, $\\lambda_{i,fwd}$, is the energy required to distort the molecule from its equilibrium geometry in the reduced state, $Q_R$, to the equilibrium geometry of the oxidized state, $Q_O$, while remaining on the PES of the reduced state.

We begin by formalizing the potential energy surfaces (PES) of the ground, $V_g$, and excited, $V_e$, electronic states as a function of a collective nuclear coordinate, $q$.\n\nLet the ground state PES be a harmonic potential centered at $q=0$:\n$$V_g(q) = \\frac{1}{2} k q^2$$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant. The problem states that the curvature is identical for both states, implying the same force constant $k$. The excited state PES is displaced by $\\Delta q$ along the coordinate $q$ and has an electronic energy offset of $E_{00}$ (the zero-zero transition energy):\n$$V_e(q) = E_{00} + \\frac{1}{2} k (q - \\Delta q)^2$$\n\nAccording to the Franck-Condon principle, electronic transitions (absorption and emission) are vertical, meaning they occur at a fixed nuclear coordinate. Absorption occurs from the thermal equilibrium of the ground state, which is at its potential minimum, $q=0$. The absorption energy, $E_{abs}$, is therefore:\n$$E_{abs} = V_e(0) - V_g(0) = \\left( E_{00} + \\frac{1}{2} k (0 - \\Delta q)^2 \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k (0)^2 \\right) = E_{00} + \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta q)^2$$\n\nEmission occurs from the thermal equilibrium of the excited state, located at its potential minimum, $q=\\Delta q$.

For the process of excitation followed by relaxation, the reorganization energy is the energy difference on the excited state PES between the Franck-Condon point ($q=0$) and the relaxed minimum ($q=\\Delta q$), which corresponds to $\\lambda = V_e(0) - V_e(\\Delta q) = \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta q)^2$.

Subtracting the expression for $E_{em}$ from $E_{abs}$ directly relates the Stokes shift to the total reorganization energy:\n$$\\Delta E_{Stokes} = E_{abs} - E_{em} = (E_{00} + \\lambda_{tot}) - (E_{00} - \\lambda_{tot}) = 2\\lambda_{tot}$$\nFrom this, we can determine $\\lambda_{tot}$ from the provided experimental data:\n$$\\lambda_{tot} = \\frac{E_{abs} - E_{em}}{2}$$\nUsing the given values $E_{abs} = 2.450 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{em} = 2.050 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$\\lambda_{tot} = \\frac{2.450 \\ \\mathrm{eV} - 2.050 \\ \\mathrm{eV}}{2} = \\frac{0.400 \\ \\mathrm{eV}}{2} = 0.200 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe total reorganization energy can be partitioned into a sum of contributions from intramolecular vibrations (inner-sphere, $\\lambda_{in}$) and the surrounding solvent medium (outer-sphere, $\\lambda_{out}$):\n$$\\lambda_{tot} = \\lambda_{in} + \\lambda_{out}$$\n\nThe contribution from each intramolecular mode $i$ to the inner-sphere reorganization energy, $\\lambda_i$, is defined by its Huang-Rhys factor $S_i$ and its vibrational quantum energy $\\hbar \\omega_i$:\n$$S_i = \\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\hbar \\omega_i} \\implies \\lambda_i = S_i \\hbar \\omega_i$$\nThe total inner-sphere reorganization energy is the sum over all coupled modes. For the two modes given:\n$$\\lambda_{in} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\lambda_i = S_1 \\hbar \\omega_1 + S_2 \\hbar \\omega_2$$\nSubstituting the provided values, $S_1 = 0.70$, $\\hbar \\omega_1 = 0.160 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$, $S_2 = 0.30$, and $\\hbar \\omega_2 = 0.080 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$\\lambda_{in} = (0.70)(0.160 \\ \\mathrm{eV}) + (0.30)(0.080 \\ \\mathrm{eV})$$\n$$\\lambda_{in} = 0.112 \\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.024 \\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.136 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nFinally, we deduce the outer-sphere reorganization energy by subtracting the inner-sphere contribution from the total reorganization energy:\n$$\\lambda_{out} = \\lambda_{tot} - \\lambda_{in}$$\n$$\\lambda_{out} = 0.200 \\ \\mathrm{eV} - 0.136 \\ \\mathrm{eV} = 0.064 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.064 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$, which, when expressed to three significant figures, is $0.0640 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0640}$$", "id": "2935463"}]}
