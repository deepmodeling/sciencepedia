It also requires the number of Slater determinants that span this subspace.\n\nThe fundamental principles are the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions, which dictates the antisymmetry of the total wave function, and the properties of the spin projection operator. For a multi-electron system, the basis of the antisymmetric Hilbert space is constructed from Slater determinants. A Slater determinant is built by selecting $N$ distinct spin orbitals from the available set of $M$ orthonormal spin orbitals.\n\nThe given one-particle basis consists of $M=4$ orthonormal spin orbitals, $\\{\\chi_i(\\mathbf{x})\\}_{i=1}^4$. These are formed from $M_{spatial}=2$ spatial orbitals, $\\{\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}), \\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r})\\}$, and $M_{spin}=2$ spin functions, $\\{\\alpha(s), \\beta(s)\\}$. The set comprises $M_\\alpha = 2$ spin orbitals of $\\alpha$ type ($\\chi_{1\\alpha}$, $\\chi_{2\\alpha}$) and $M_\\beta = 2$ spin orbitals of $\\beta$ type ($\\chi_{1\\beta}$, $\\chi_{2\\beta}$).\n\nA state of the $N=2$ electron system is represented by a Slater determinant, which ensures antisymmetry. A general Slater determinant is formed by choosing $N=2$ distinct spin orbitals, say $\\chi_i$ and $\\chi_j$, and is denoted $|\\chi_i \\chi_j\\rangle$. The total number of possible Slater determinants, which is the dimension of the full configuration interaction space for $N=2$ electrons, is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H}_{N=2}) = \\binom{M}{N} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 $$\n\nWe must now apply the constraint that the states of interest are eigenvectors of the total spin projection operator, $\\hat{S}_z = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\hat{s}_z(k)$, with eigenvalue $S_z=0$. The one-electron spin functions $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are eigenfunctions of the single-particle spin projection operator $\\hat{s}_z$ with eigenvalues $+\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}$, respectively (in units where $\\hbar=1$).\n$$ \\hat{s}_z \\alpha(s) = +\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha(s) $$\n$$ \\hat{s}_z \\beta(s) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\beta(s) $$\nAny spin orbital $\\chi_{p\\sigma}$ is therefore an eigenfunction of $\\hat{s}_z$ with an eigenvalue determined solely by its spin part $\\sigma$. A Slater determinant constructed from a specific set of $N$ spin orbitals is an eigenfunction of the total operator $\\hat{S}_z$. The corresponding eigenvalue, $S_z$, is the sum of the individual $s_z$ eigenvalues of the occupied spin orbitals.\n\nLet a Slater determinant be constructed by occupying $N_\\alpha$ spin orbitals of $\\alpha$ type and $N_\\beta$ spin orbitals of $\\beta$ type. The total number of electrons is $N = N_\\alpha + N_\\beta$. The total spin projection eigenvalue for such a determinant is:\n$$ S_z = N_\\alpha \\left(+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + N_\\beta \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (N_\\alpha - N_\\beta) $$\nThe problem specifies the condition $S_z=0$, which implies the constraint:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} (N_\\alpha - N_\\beta) = 0 \\implies N_\\alpha = N_\\beta $$\nFor our system of $N=2$ electrons, this condition must be satisfied along with the particle number conservation, $N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = 2$. Solving the system of equations\n$$ \\begin{cases} N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = 2 \\\\ N_\\alpha - N_\\beta = 0 \\end{cases} $$\nyields $2N_\\alpha = 2$, which gives unambiguously $N_\\alpha = 1$ and $N_\\beta = 1$.\n\nThis result dictates that any Slater determinant with $S_z=0$ must be constructed by choosing exactly one electron to occupy an $\\alpha$-spin orbital and one electron to occupy a $\\beta$-spin orbital. The number of such determinants is found by calculating the number of ways to make these choices independently.\nThe number of ways to choose $N_\\alpha = 1$ spin orbital from the available $M_\\alpha = 2$ $\\alpha$-spin orbitals is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{M_\\alpha}{N_\\alpha} = \\binom{2}{1} = 2 $$\nThe number of ways to choose $N_\\beta = 1$ spin orbital from the available $M_\\beta = 2$ $\\beta$-spin orbitals is:\n$$ \\binom{M_\\beta}{N_\\beta} = \\binom{2}{1} = 2 $$\nSince the choice of the $\\alpha$-spin orbital and the $\\beta$-spin orbital are independent, the total number of distinct Slater determinants that satisfy the $S_z=0$ condition is the product of these two numbers:\n$$ \\text{Number of determinants with } S_z=0 = \\binom{M_\\alpha}{N_\\alpha} \\times \\binom{M_\\beta}{N_\\beta} = \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 $$\nThese four determinants, explicitly, are $|\\chi_{1\\alpha} \\chi_{1\\beta}\\rangle$, $|\\chi_{1\\alpha} \\chi_{2\\beta}\\rangle$, $|\\chi_{2\\alpha} \\chi_{1\\beta}\\rangle$, and $|\\chi_{2\\alpha} \\chi_{2\\beta}\\rangle$. This answers the second part of the question.\n\nFor the first part, we must determine the dimension of the $S_z=0$ subspace. The Slater determinants constructed from an orthonormal set of one-particle orbitals form an orthonormal basis for the many-particle Hilbert space. The four determinants we have enumerated are constructed from distinct pairs of spin orbitals, for example $\\{\\chi_{1\\alpha}, \\chi_{1\\beta}\\}$ and $\\{\\chi_{1\\alpha}, \\chi_{2\\beta}\\}$, and are therefore orthonormal to each other. A set of orthonormal vectors is necessarily linearly independent.\nBy definition, a basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that spans the space. The dimension of the vector space is the number of vectors in any such basis. The four Slater determinants with $S_z=0$ are linearly independent and they span, by construction, the entire subspace of $S_z=0$ states within the full CI space. Therefore, they form an orthonormal basis for this subspace.\nConsequently, the dimension of the $S_z=0$ antisymmetric subspace is equal to the number of these basis vectors.\n\n(i) The dimension of the $S_z=0$ antisymmetric subspace is $4$.\n(ii) The number of distinct Slater determinants that span this subspace is $4$.\nThe two quantities are identical because the Slater determinants with a fixed configuration of $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta$ form an orthonormal basis for the corresponding $S_z$ eigenspace.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2893374"}, {"introduction": "While Slater determinants form a convenient computational basis, true electronic states are eigenfunctions of the spin-squared operator, $\\hat{S}^2$.

It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a system comprised of $N=3$ electrons distributed among $K=3$ orthonormal spatial orbitals $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}, \\phi_{3}\\}$. We are restricted to a subspace of the total Hilbert space characterized by a fixed total spin projection $S_{z} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This value of $S_{z}$ implies that the number of electrons with $\\alpha$ spin ($m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$) is $N_{\\alpha}=2$, and the number of electrons with $\\beta$ spin ($m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$) is $N_{\\beta}=1$, since $S_{z} = \\frac{1}{2}(N_{\\alpha} - N_{\\beta})$.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of distinct Slater determinants, $N_{\\text{det}}$, that span this $S_{z}=\\frac{1}{2}$ sector. A Slater determinant is uniquely specified by the set of $N$ occupied spin-orbitals, which must be distinct according to the Pauli exclusion principle. In our case, we must choose $N_{\\alpha}=2$ distinct spatial orbitals to be occupied by $\\alpha$-spin electrons and $N_{\\beta}=1$ spatial orbital to be occupied by a $\\beta$-spin electron.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $N_{\\alpha}=2$ spatial orbitals out of the available $K=3$ orbitals for the $\\alpha$ electrons is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{K}{N_{\\alpha}}$.\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose $N_{\\beta}=1$ spatial orbital out of the available $K=3$ orbitals for the $\\beta$ electron is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{K}{N_{\\beta}}$.\nSince the choices for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ spin-orbitals are independent, the total number of distinct Slater determinants is the product of these two quantities:\n$$N_{\\text{det}} = \\binom{K}{N_{\\alpha}} \\binom{K}{N_{\\beta}}$$\nSubstituting the given values $K=3$, $N_{\\alpha}=2$, and $N_{\\beta}=1$:\n$$N_{\\text{det}} = \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{3}{1} = \\left(\\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!}\\right) = (3)(3) = 9$$\nThus, there are $9$ distinct Slater determinants in the $S_{z}=\\frac{1}{2}$ sector of this Hilbert space.\n\nNext, we must determine the number of linearly independent Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for total spin $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $S=\\frac{3}{2}$. CSFs are linear combinations of Slater determinants which are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the total spin-squared operator $\\hat{S}^{2}$ and the spin-projection operator $\\hat{S}_{z}$.\nThe space spanned by the $N_{\\text{det}}$ determinants with a fixed value of $S_{z}$ can be decomposed into a direct sum of orthogonal subspaces, each corresponding to a definite total spin quantum number $S$. The dimension of the subspace corresponding to a given $S$ (for any $S_{z}$ such that $|S_{z}| \\le S$) is precisely the number of linearly independent CSFs for that spin, which we denote as $N_{\\text{CSF}}(S)$.\n\nThe dimension of the determinantal space for a given $S_{z}$, which we calculated as $N_{\\text{det}}(S_z) = \\binom{K}{N_{\\alpha}}\\binom{K}{N_{\\beta}}$, is related to the number of CSFs by the following sum rule, which is a consequence of the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of spin angular momentum:\n$$N_{\\text{det}}(S_z) = \\sum_{S \\geq |S_z|} N_{\\text{CSF}}(S)$$\nFor a system of $N=3$ electrons (spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles), the possible values of total spin are $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $S=\\frac{3}{2}$. To find the two unknowns, $N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{1}{2})$ and $N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{3}{2})$, we will apply the sum rule to two different $S_{z}$ sectors.\n\nLet us first consider the sector with the maximum possible spin projection, $S_{z}=\\frac{3}{2}$. For this sector, we must have $N_{\\alpha}=3$ and $N_{\\beta}=0$. The number of determinants is:\n$$N_{\\text{det}}(S_z=\\frac{3}{2}) = \\binom{3}{3}\\binom{3}{0} = (1)(1) = 1$$\nApplying the sum rule for this sector:\n$$N_{\\text{det}}(S_z=\\frac{3}{2}) = \\sum_{S \\geq \\frac{3}{2}} N_{\\text{CSF}}(S) = N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{3}{2})$$\nThe sum only includes $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ because it is the highest possible spin for $N=3$ electrons. Therefore, we find:\n$$N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{3}{2}) = 1$$\n\nNow, we return to the sector of interest, $S_{z}=\\frac{1}{2}$. We have already calculated the number of determinants in this sector to be $N_{\\text{det}}(S_z=\\frac{1}{2})=9$. The sum rule is:\n$$N_{\\text{det}}(S_z=\\frac{1}{2}) = \\sum_{S \\geq \\frac{1}{2}} N_{\\text{CSF}}(S)$$\nFor $N=3$ electrons, this sum includes terms for $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $S=\\frac{3}{2}$:\n$$N_{\\text{det}}(S_z=\\frac{1}{2}) = N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{1}{2}) + N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{3}{2})$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$9 = N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{1}{2}) + 1$$\nSolving for $N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{1}{2})$ yields:\n$$N_{\\text{CSF}}(S=\\frac{1}{2}) = 9 - 1 = 8$$\n\nIn summary, the number of determinants in the $S_{z}=\\frac{1}{2}$ sector is $9$. Within this sector, the number of CSFs with total spin $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ is $8$, and the number of CSFs with total spin $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ is $1$.

It is a standard, solvable problem in theoretical chemistry. The problem is deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we derive the exact ground-state energy $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t)$ by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ in the appropriate basis. The system consists of two electrons on two sites. The total number of spin-orbitals is $4$, so the full Hilbert space for two electrons has dimension $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. We are restricted to the spin-singlet ($S=0$) sector. The Hamiltonian possesses spatial symmetry under the exchange of sites $1$ and $2$. The ground state must be an eigenstate of the site permutation operator $\\hat{P}_{12}$ and must belong to the symmetric (gerade) representation, as the hopping term connects sites and lowers energy.\n\nWe construct a basis for the symmetric singlet subspace using site-based many-electron states. Two such states exist: one with both electrons on the same site (ionic) and one with one electron on each site (covalent).\n$1$. The symmetric ionic configuration is a superposition of having two electrons on site $1$ and two electrons on site $2$:\n$$ |\\Phi_{ion}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\hat{c}_{1\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{1\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} + \\hat{c}_{2\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} \\right) |vac\\rangle $$\n$2$. The covalent singlet configuration, which is also symmetric under site exchange, places one electron on each site in a spin-singlet state:\n$$ |\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\hat{c}_{1\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} - \\hat{c}_{1\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\uparrow}^{\\dagger} \\right) |vac\\rangle $$\nThese two states, $|\\Phi_{ion}\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle$, form a complete orthonormal basis for the symmetric singlet subspace. We now construct the Hamiltonian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ in this basis.\n\nThe diagonal matrix elements are:\n$H_{11} = \\langle \\Phi_{ion} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{ion} \\rangle$. The hopping term of $\\hat{H}$ moves an electron to a different site, thus yielding zero when acting on a state and projecting back onto the same state with two electrons on the same sites. Only the potential term contributes.\n$$ H_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\hat{c}_{1\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{1\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} + \\hat{c}_{2\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} | U (\\hat{n}_{1\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{1\\downarrow} + \\hat{n}_{2\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{2\\downarrow}) | \\hat{c}_{1\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{1\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} + \\hat{c}_{2\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(U+U) = U $$\n$H_{22} = \\langle \\Phi_{cov} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{cov} \\rangle$. The state $|\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle$ has no double occupancy, so the potential energy term is zero ($\\hat{V}|\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle=0$). The hopping term acting on $|\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle$ produces a state with double occupancy, so its projection back onto $|\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle$ is zero.\n$$ H_{22} = 0 $$\nThe off-diagonal element $H_{12} = \\langle \\Phi_{ion} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{cov} \\rangle$:\nThe potential term does not connect states with different numbers of doubly occupied sites, so we only need to consider the hopping term $\\hat{T} = -t \\sum_{\\sigma} (\\hat{c}_{1\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\sigma} + \\hat{c}_{2\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{1\\sigma})$.\n$$ \\hat{T} |\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle = \\frac{-t}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{\\sigma} (\\hat{c}_{1\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\sigma} + \\hat{c}_{2\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{1\\sigma}) (\\hat{c}_{1\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\downarrow}^{\\dagger} - \\hat{c}_{1\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{2\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}) |vac\\rangle $$\nApplying the operators and using fermionic anti-commutation relations, one finds that $\\hat{T} |\\Phi_{cov}\\rangle = -2t |\\Phi_{ion}\\rangle$.\nTherefore, $H_{12} = \\langle \\Phi_{ion} | -2t | \\Phi_{ion} \\rangle = -2t$. Since $\\hat{H}$ is Hermitian, $H_{21} = H_{12} = -2t$.\nThe Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} U & -2t \\\\ -2t & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues $E$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{H} - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ (U-E)(-E) - (-2t)^2 = 0 \\implies E^2 - UE - 4t^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions are $E = \\frac{U \\pm \\sqrt{U^2 - 4(1)(-4t^2)}}{2} = \\frac{U \\pm \\sqrt{U^2 + 16t^2}}{2}$. The exact ground-state energy corresponds to the negative root:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t) = \\frac{U - \\sqrt{U^2 + 16t^2}}{2} $$\nNext, we consider the CISD energy. The RHF reference state is formed from the two molecular orbitals (MOs) of the one-electron hopping operator: the bonding orbital $|\\psi_b\\rangle$ and antibonding orbital $|\\psi_a\\rangle$. Two electrons occupy $|\\psi_b\\rangle$, forming the RHF state $|\\Psi_{RHF}\\rangle = \\hat{b}_{\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_{\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}|vac\\rangle$.\nThe CISD method consists of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the basis of the RHF reference state, all singly excited configurations, and all doubly excited configurations.\nFor a system with $N=2$ electrons, excitations are generated by promoting one or two electrons from occupied to virtual orbitals. A triple excitation would require moving three electrons, which is impossible. Higher excitations are likewise impossible.\nThus, for any $N=2$ electron system, the set of single (S) and double (D) excitations from a reference determinant spans the entire remaining Hilbert space. The CISD configuration space is therefore identical to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) space.\nBy definition, FCI diagonalizes the Hamiltonian in the complete many-body basis for the chosen one-particle basis set. It is therefore the exact solution for the given Hamiltonian and basis.\nSince this problem is defined entirely within the space spanned by the two atomic site orbitals, the FCI solution is the exact solution of the problem.\nFrom this reasoning, CISD is equivalent to FCI for this system, so $E_{\\mathrm{CISD}}(U,t) = E_{\\mathrm{FCI}}(U,t) = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t)$ for all values of $U$ and $t$.\n\nFinally, we determine the limit $L$.\n$$ L = \\lim_{(U/t)\\to \\infty} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{CISD}}(U,t)}{E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t)} $$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{CISD}}(U,t) = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t)$, the ratio is identically equal to $1$ for all parameters where $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t) \\ne 0$. For any $t > 0$, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t) < 0$. Thus, the ratio is well-defined and equals $1$.\nThe limit of a constant function is the constant itself.\n$$ L = \\lim_{(U/t)\\to \\infty} 1 = 1 $$\n\nThe two requested quantities are the exact ground-state energy $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(U,t)$ and the limit $L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{U - \\sqrt{U^2 + 16t^2}}{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2893384"}]}
