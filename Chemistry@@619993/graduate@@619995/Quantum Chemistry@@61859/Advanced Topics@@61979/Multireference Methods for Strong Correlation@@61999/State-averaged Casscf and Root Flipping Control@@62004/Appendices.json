It is a standard, albeit non-trivial, exercise in understanding the parameter space of a CASSCF calculation. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\nThe total number of molecular orbitals (MOs) is $N = n_{\\mathrm{inact}} + n_{\\mathrm{act}} + n_{\\mathrm{virt}}$. For the given values, $N = 5 + 8 + 13 = 26$. These orbitals form an orthonormal basis. An arbitrary transformation between these orbitals can be expressed as a unitary transformation, $\\mathbf{U}$. An infinitesimal unitary transformation is given by $\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{I} + \\delta\\mathbf{U}$, where $\\delta\\mathbf{U}$ is an anti-Hermitian matrix, $\\delta\\mathbf{U}^\\dagger = -\\delta\\mathbf{U}$. A general finite unitary transformation is generated by the exponential map $\\mathbf{U} = \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$ is an anti-Hermitian matrix ($\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\dagger = -\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$).\n\nThe problem specifies real orbitals. For a basis of real orbitals, the unitary transformation must be a real orthogonal transformation, $\\mathbf{O}$, with $\\mathbf{O}^T\\mathbf{O} = \\mathbf{I}$. The generator of this transformation is a real anti-symmetric matrix, $\\mathbf{X}$, where $\\mathbf{X}^T = -\\mathbf{X}$. The transformation is given by $\\mathbf{O} = \\exp(\\mathbf{X})$.\n\nThe dimension of the space of all possible orbital rotations is the number of independent parameters in the $N \\times N$ real anti-symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. An $N \\times N$ anti-symmetric matrix has zeroes on the diagonal, and the elements below the diagonal are determined by the elements above it ($X_{ji} = -X_{ij}$). Therefore, the number of independent parameters is the number of elements in the upper triangle, which is $\\binom{N}{2} = \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the state-averaged CASSCF energy is invariant to rotations of orbitals within any of the three subspaces: inactive, active, or virtual. These are termed redundant rotations as they do not affect the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The orbital rotation generator $\\mathbf{X}$ can be partitioned into blocks corresponding to these subspaces:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-inact}} & \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-act}} & \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-virt}} \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-inact}} & \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-act}} & \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-virt}} \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{virt-inact}} & \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{virt-act}} & \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{virt-virt}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe anti-symmetry of $\\mathbf{X}$ implies that the diagonal blocks ($\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-inact}}$, $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-act}}$, $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{virt-virt}}$) must themselves be anti-symmetric, and the off-diagonal blocks are related by $\\mathbf{X}_{ji} = -\\mathbf{X}_{ij}^T$.\n\nThe redundant rotations are those confined within a single subspace, corresponding to the diagonal blocks of $\\mathbf{X}$:\n1.  **Inactive-Inactive rotations**: The number of independent parameters in the $n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{inact}}$ anti-symmetric block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-inact}}$ is $\\binom{n_{\\mathrm{inact}}}{2}$.\n2.  **Active-Active rotations**: The number of independent parameters in the $n_{\\mathrm{act}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{act}}$ anti-symmetric block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-act}}$ is $\\binom{n_{\\mathrm{act}}}{2}$.\n3.  **Virtual-Virtual rotations**: The number of independent parameters in the $n_{\\mathrm{virt}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}}$ anti-symmetric block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{virt-virt}}$ is $\\binom{n_{\\mathrm{virt}}}{2}$.\n\nThe total number of redundant rotations is the sum of these counts: $N_{\\mathrm{redundant}} = \\binom{n_{\\mathrm{inact}}}{2} + \\binom{n_{\\mathrm{act}}}{2} + \\binom{n_{\\mathrm{virt}}}{2}$.\n\nThe orbital rotations that can change the SA-CASSCF energy are the non-redundant rotations, which mix orbitals between different subspaces. These are described by the off-diagonal blocks of the generator matrix $\\mathbf{X}$. The number of independent parameters in these blocks are:\n1.  **Inactive-Active mixing**: The block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-act}}$ is a general $n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{act}}$ matrix. The number of parameters is $n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{act}}$. The block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-inact}}$ is fixed by the anti-symmetry condition and introduces no new parameters.\n2.  **Inactive-Virtual mixing**: The block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{inact-virt}}$ is a general $n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}}$ matrix. The number of parameters is $n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}}$.\n3.  **Active-Virtual mixing**: The block $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathrm{act-virt}}$ is a general $n_{\\mathrm{act}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}}$ matrix. The number of parameters is $n_{\\mathrm{act}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}}$.\n\nThe total count of independent, non-redundant orbital rotation parameters, denoted $N_{\\mathrm{non-red}}$, is the sum of the parameters for these inter-subspace mixings:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{non-red}} = (n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{act}}) + (n_{\\mathrm{inact}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}}) + (n_{\\mathrm{act}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{virt}})\n$$\nThis is precisely the total number of rotations, $\\binom{N}{2}$, minus the number of redundant rotations. The information regarding the root-flipping control scheme is extraneous to the counting of orbital rotation parameters, as the problem correctly states it \"does not alter the orbital-invariance structure.\"\n\nNow, we evaluate this count for the given parameters: $n_{\\mathrm{inact}}=5$, $n_{\\mathrm{act}}=8$, and $n_{\\mathrm{virt}}=13$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{non-red}} = (5 \\times 8) + (5 \\times 13) + (8 \\times 13)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{non-red}} = 40 + 65 + 104\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{non-red}} = 209\n$$\nThis is the number of independent orbital rotation parameters that must be optimized in a standard CASSCF procedure to minimize the state-averaged energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{209}$$", "id": "2927653"}, {"introduction": "This exercise bridges the gap between the abstract formalism of quantum chemistry and its practical application in interpreting computational results.

The state-averaged NOONs at $R_{1}$ are $n_{1}(R_{1}) = 1.04$ and $n_{2}(R_{1}) = 0.96$.\n\nAt geometry $R_{2}$:\nThe state-specific 1-RDMs are given as:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{(1)}(R_{2})=\\begin{pmatrix}1.20 & 0.20\\\\ 0.20 & 0.80\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Gamma^{(2)}(R_{2})=\\begin{pmatrix}0.80 & -0.20\\\\ -0.20 & 1.20\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe state-averaged 1-RDM at $R_{2}$ is:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{SA}}(R_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}1.20 & 0.20\\\\ 0.20 & 0.80\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}0.80 & -0.20\\\\ -0.20 & 1.20\\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}1.20+0.80 & 0.20-0.20\\\\ 0.20-0.20 & 0.80+1.20\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}2.00 & 0.00\\\\ 0.00 & 2.00\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{SA}}(R_{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}1.00 & 0.00\\\\ 0.00 & 1.00\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is also diagonal. The state-averaged NOONs at $R_{2}$ are degenerate: $n_{1}(R_{2}) = 1.00$ and $n_{2}(R_{2}) = 1.00$.\n\nTask 2: State-specific NOONs and interpretation.\n\nFirst, we find the state-specific NOONs by diagonalizing each $\\Gamma^{(k)}(R)$ matrix.\nAt $R_{1}$:\n$\\Gamma^{(1)}(R_{1})$ is already diagonal. The NOONs are $n_{1}^{(1)}(R_{1})=1.98$ and $n_{2}^{(1)}(R_{1})=0.02$.\n$\\Gamma^{(2)}(R_{1})$ is already diagonal. The NOONs are $n_{1}^{(2)}(R_{1})=0.10$ and $n_{2}^{(2)}(R_{1})=1.90$.\n\nAt $R_{2}$:\nFor $\\Gamma^{(1)}(R_{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}1.20 & 0.20\\\\ 0.20 & 0.80\\end{pmatrix}$, we find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\Gamma^{(1)}(R_{2}) - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n(1.20 - \\lambda)(0.80 - \\lambda) - (0.20)^{2} = 0 \\implies \\lambda^{2} - 2.00\\lambda + 0.96 - 0.04 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^{2} - 2.00\\lambda + 0.92 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions are $\\lambda = \\frac{2.00 \\pm \\sqrt{4.00 - 4(0.92)}}{2} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 0.92} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{0.08}$.\nThus, the state-specific NOONs for the first state at $R_2$ are $n^{(1)}_{1}(R_{2}) = 1 + \\sqrt{0.08}$ and $n^{(1)}_{2}(R_{2}) = 1 - \\sqrt{0.08}$.\n\nFor $\\Gamma^{(2)}(R_{2}) = \\begin{pmatrix}0.80 & -0.20\\\\ -0.20 & 1.20\\end{pmatrix}$, the characteristic equation is:\n$$\n(0.80 - \\lambda)(1.20 - \\lambda) - (-0.20)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis is identical to the equation for $\\Gamma^{(1)}(R_{2})$, yielding the same eigenvalues. The state-specific NOONs for the second state at $R_2$ are $n^{(2)}_{1}(R_{2}) = 1 + \\sqrt{0.08}$ and $n^{(2)}_{2}(R_{2}) = 1 - \\sqrt{0.08}$.\n\nInterpretation:\nActive space selection: At geometry $R_{1}$, the ground state NOONs ($1.98$, $0.02$) are very close to integer values ($2$, $0$), indicating a state dominated by a single electronic configuration, $(\\phi_{1})^{2}$. The second orbital $\\phi_{2}$ is nearly empty. Conversely, the first excited state has NOONs ($0.10$, $1.90$), indicating a dominant configuration involving two electrons associated with $\\phi_{2}$. Upon stretching the molecule to $R_{2}$, the situation changes dramatically. For both states, the NOONs become $1 \\pm \\sqrt{0.08} \\approx 1 \\pm 0.283$, which are significantly deviated from integers. The value of $\\sqrt{0.08}$ is non-negligible. This strong fractional character of the occupations for both orbitals in both states signifies strong static correlation. It implies that any accurate description of the electronic structure at $R_{2}$ must treat both orbitals $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ as \"active\", meaning they are both partially occupied. Therefore, the choice to include both orbitals in the active space is essential for a qualitatively correct description across the entire coordinate scan from $R_{1}$ to $R_{2}$.\n\nRoot flipping control: Root flipping is a notorious convergence artifact in state-specific MCSCF calculations, particularly near avoided crossings or conical intersections. In a state-specific calculation, the orbitals are optimized to minimize the energy of a single target state (e.g., the ground state). As the geometry changes from $R_{1}$ to $R_{2}$, the electronic character of the states changes. At $R_{1}$, the ground state is primarily $(\\phi_{1})^{2}$ and the first excited state is distinct. At $R_{2}$, the two states are strong mixtures of configurations and have become energetically close (implied by the strong mixing). A state-specific calculation tracking the \"first root\" might find orbitals optimal for the $(\\phi_{1})^{2}$-like state at $R_{1}$ but then, at a geometry near $R_{2}$, the SCF procedure might suddenly converge to the *other* state, which has become lower in energy, or to a solution with a different orbital character. This switch in the electronic state to which the calculation converges is \"root flipping\" and leads to a discontinuity in the potential energy surface.\n\nState-averaging mitigates this by optimizing a single set of molecular orbitals that provides a balanced description for an ensemble of states. In our model, the SA-CASSCF method uses an orbital basis that is optimal for the state-averaged density $\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{SA}}$. We observe that the state-averaged natural orbitals (the eigenvectors of $\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{SA}}$) are the original basis orbitals $\\{\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\}$ at both $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ because $\\Gamma^{\\mathrm{SA}}$ is diagonal in this basis at both geometries. This orbital stability is the key. By using a common, stable set of orbitals for all states at all geometries, the method ensures that the identity of the states (as defined by their coefficients in the common CI expansion) is smoothly tracked. The state-averaging procedure effectively \"locks\" the orbitals to a compromise representation, preventing the sudden changes in orbital character that underlie root flipping.\n\nTask 3: Calculation of the von Neumann entropy at $R_{2}$.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy $S$ of a 1-RDM is a measure of the multireference character of the electronic state. It is defined for the state-averaged case as:\n$$\nS(R_{2}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\left(\\frac{n_{i}(R_{2})}{2}\\right)\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{n_{i}(R_{2})}{2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_{i}(R_{2})$ are the state-averaged NOONs at geometry $R_{2}$. The division by $2$ normalizes the spin-summed occupations to a probability distribution for a single electron, as $\\sum_{i} n_{i} = N_{e}$ (number of electrons), so $\\sum_{i} (n_{i}/N_{e}) = 1$. Here $N_{e}=2$.\n\nFrom Task 1, we found the state-averaged NOONs at $R_{2}$ to be $n_{1}(R_{2}) = 1.00$ and $n_{2}(R_{2}) = 1.00$.\nSubstituting these values into the entropy formula:\n$$\nS(R_{2}) = -\\left[ \\left(\\frac{1.00}{2}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.00}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1.00}{2}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1.00}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS(R_{2}) = -2 \\left[ \\left(0.5\\right)\\ln\\left(0.5\\right) \\right] = -\\ln(0.5)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\nS(R_{2}) = -(-\\ln(2)) = \\ln(2)\n$$\nThe value of $\\ln(2)$ is approximately $0.693147...$ nats. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\nS(R_{2}) \\approx 0.6931\n$$\nThis maximal entropy for a two-orbital system indicates maximal multireference character in the state-averaged description at the stretched geometry $R_{2}$, consistent with the degenerate occupations of $1.00$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6931}\n$$", "id": "2927620"}, {"introduction": "The SA-CASSCF method is an indispensable tool for studying phenomena like photochemical reactions and conical intersections, primarily for its ability to prevent root flipping.

This energy is defined as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{SA}}(R) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,E_{0}(R) + \\frac{1}{2}\\,E_{1}(R)\n$$\nThe individual potential energy surfaces for the two states, $E_{0}(R)$ and $E_{1}(R)$, are given by harmonic approximations:\n$$\nE_{0}(R) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{0}\\,(R - R_{0})^{2} + E_{0}^{\\min}\n$$\n$$\nE_{1}(R) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{1}\\,(R - R_{1})^{2} + E_{1}^{\\min}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $E_{\\mathrm{SA}}(R)$, we obtain the explicit form of the function to be minimized:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{SA}}(R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{0}\\,(R - R_{0})^{2} + E_{0}^{\\min} \\right] + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,k_{1}\\,(R - R_{1})^{2} + E_{1}^{\\min} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{SA}}(R) = \\frac{1}{4}k_{0}(R - R_{0})^{2} + \\frac{1}{4}k_{1}(R - R_{1})^{2} + C\n$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{0}^{\\min} + E_{1}^{\\min})$ is a constant that does not depend on the coordinate $R$ and will vanish upon differentiation.\n\nFrom the principles of calculus, a minimum of a function is located at a critical point where its first derivative with respect to the variable of interest is zero. We must find the value $R = R_{\\mathrm{SA}}$ such that $\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{SA}}}{dR} = 0$.\n\nWe compute the first derivative of $E_{\\mathrm{SA}}(R)$ with respect to $R$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{SA}}}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}k_{0}(R - R_{0})^{2} + \\frac{1}{4}k_{1}(R - R_{1})^{2} + C \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{SA}}}{dR} = \\frac{1}{4}k_{0} \\cdot 2(R - R_{0}) \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4}k_{1} \\cdot 2(R - R_{1}) \\cdot 1 + 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{SA}}}{dR} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{0}(R - R_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2}k_{1}(R - R_{1})\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero at the optimal geometry $R = R_{\\mathrm{SA}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}k_{0}(R_{\\mathrm{SA}} - R_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2}k_{1}(R_{\\mathrm{SA}} - R_{1}) = 0\n$$\nWe can multiply the entire equation by $2$ and rearrange the terms to solve for $R_{\\mathrm{SA}}$:\n$$\nk_{0}R_{\\mathrm{SA}} - k_{0}R_{0} + k_{1}R_{\\mathrm{SA}} - k_{1}R_{1} = 0\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{SA}}(k_{0} + k_{1}) = k_{0}R_{0} + k_{1}R_{1}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{SA}} = \\frac{k_{0}R_{0} + k_{1}R_{1}}{k_{0} + k_{1}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the SA-CASSCF optimal geometry is a weighted average of the equilibrium geometries of the individual states, where the weights are their respective harmonic force constants.\n\nTo confirm that this stationary point is a minimum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}E_{\\mathrm{SA}}}{dR^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}k_{0}(R - R_{0}) + \\frac{1}{2}k_{1}(R - R_{1}) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}k_{0} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{1}\n$$\nGiven the force constants are positive ($k_{0} = 4.0$ and $k_{1} = 1.0$), the second derivative is strictly positive. This confirms that $R_{\\mathrm{SA}}$ corresponds to a minimum of the state-averaged potential energy surface.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$k_{0} = 4.0$\n$k_{1} = 1.0$\n$R_{0} = 1.200$ angstroms\n$R_{1} = 1.350$ angstroms\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{SA}} = \\frac{(4.0)(1.200) + (1.0)(1.350)}{4.0 + 1.0} = \\frac{4.800 + 1.350}{5.0} = \\frac{6.150}{5.0} = 1.230 \\text{ angstroms}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the geometry displacement, $\\Delta R = |R_{\\mathrm{SA}} - R_{0}|$.\n$$\n\\Delta R = |1.230 - 1.200| = 0.030 \\text{ angstroms}\n$$\nThe final result is to be expressed with three significant figures. The calculated value $0.030$ has two significant figures (the leading zero is not significant, but the trailing zero is). To express this result with three significant figures, we must write it as $0.0300$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0300}\n$$", "id": "2927677"}]}
