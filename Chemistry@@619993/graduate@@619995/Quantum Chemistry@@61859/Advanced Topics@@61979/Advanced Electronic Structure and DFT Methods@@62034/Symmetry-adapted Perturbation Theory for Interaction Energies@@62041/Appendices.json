Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the first-order electrostatic interaction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{elst}}^{(1)}$, between two monomers, $A$ and $B$, within the framework of Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). As stated, this energy component corresponds to the expectation value of the intermolecular Coulomb operator, $V$, over the product of the unperturbed ground-state wavefunctions of the monomers, $\\Psi_A^{(0)}$ and $\\Psi_B^{(0)}$.\n\nThe formal expression is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{elst}}^{(1)} = \\langle \\Psi_A^{(0)} \\Psi_B^{(0)} | V | \\Psi_A^{(0)} \\Psi_B^{(0)} \\rangle$$\nThis expectation value is equivalent to the classical electrostatic interaction energy between the unperturbed charge distributions, $\\rho_A(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\rho_B(\\mathbf{r})$, of the two monomers.
