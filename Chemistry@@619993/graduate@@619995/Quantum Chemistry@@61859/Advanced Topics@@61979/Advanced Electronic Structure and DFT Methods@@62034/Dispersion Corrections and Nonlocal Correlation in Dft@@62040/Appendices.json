We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the standard asymptotic expressions for the pairwise two-body London dispersion energy and the three-body Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) non-additive energy. For a pair of atoms $i$ and $j$ separated by a distance $R_{ij}$, the two-body energy is given by:\n$$ E_{2}(R_{ij}) = -\\frac{C_{6}}{R_{ij}^{6}} $$\nHere, $C_{6}$ is the dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient, given as a positive constant.\n\nFor a triplet of atoms $i$, $j$, and $k$ forming a triangle with interior angles $\\theta_i$, $\\theta_j$, and $\\theta_k$ and side lengths $R_{ij}$, $R_{jk}$, and $R_{ki}$, the three-body ATM energy is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ATM}}(R_{ij}, R_{jk}, R_{ki}) = C_{9} \\frac{1 + 3\\cos(\\theta_i)\\cos(\\theta_j)\\cos(\\theta_k)}{(R_{ij}R_{jk}R_{ki})^3} $$\nHere, $C_{9}$ is the three-body non-additive dispersion coefficient, also a positive constant.\n\nThe problem specifies a geometric arrangement of three identical atoms at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $R$.

We substitute the geometric parameters into the general ATM formula. The product of the side lengths is $R_{ij}R_{jk}R_{ki} = R \\cdot R \\cdot R = R^3$. The product of the cosines of the interior angles is also required. We have $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe geometric factor in the numerator of the ATM expression is therefore:\n$$ 1 + 3\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 1 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} = 1 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{11}{8} $$\nSubstituting these results into the ATM energy formula yields:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ATM}}(R) = C_{9} \\frac{\\frac{11}{8}}{(R^3)^3} = \\frac{11 C_{9}}{8 R^{9}} $$\nThis expression gives the three-body energy as a function of $R$, $C_{9}$, and the fixed geometry of the equilateral triangle.

The total energy is:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{pair}} = - \\sum_{0 \\le i  j \\le N-1} \\frac{C_6}{R_{ij}^6 + R_d^6}$$\n    The summation runs over all unique pairs of atoms. The computational procedure is to iterate through all such pairs $(i,j)$, calculate their separation $R_{ij} = (j-i)s$, evaluate the damped interaction energy, and sum these contributions. The negative sign indicates an attractive potential.\n\n3.  **Deviation from Pairwise Additivity, $\\Delta E$**:\n    Finally, the deviation is computed by subtracting the pairwise energy from the more sophisticated many-body energy: $\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{MBD}} - E_{\\mathrm{pair}}$. This quantity isolates the contribution of many-body effects beyond simple pairwise additivity. A non-zero $\\Delta E$ signifies that the interaction between two atoms is modified by the presence of a third, fourth, etc., atom, a hallmark of many-body physics.\n\nThe algorithmic implementation will follow these steps for each $(N,s)$ test case provided in the problem, rounding the final result for $\\Delta E$ to $8$ decimal places as required.", "answer": "[0.00000000,-0.00000104,-0.00001088,0.00000858,-0.00000007,-0.00000000,0.00021956]", "id": "2886437"}]}
