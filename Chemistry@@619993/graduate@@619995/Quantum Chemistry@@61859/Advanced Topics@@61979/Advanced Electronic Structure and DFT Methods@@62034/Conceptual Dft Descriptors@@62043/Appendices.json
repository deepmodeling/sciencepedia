By working through the provided hypothetical dataset, you will derive and apply the finite-difference formula for $f_k^+$ from atomic charges, a common output of quantum chemistry software. Most importantly, this practice will solidify your understanding of the constant external potential condition which underpins the formal definition of the Fukui function, highlighting the critical distinction between a \"vertical\" calculation (fixed geometry) and an \"adiabatic\" one (relaxed geometry) [@problem_id:2880923].", "problem": "You are given atom-partitioned charge data for a triatomic neutral molecule with atoms labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$.

The terminology (vertical attachment, geometry optimization, real-space partitioning) is correct and standard in computational quantum chemistry.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response. I will address each part in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the expression for the condensed nucleophilic Fukui function.\nThe Fukui function, $f(\\mathbf{r})$, is defined as the first derivative of the electron density, $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$, with respect to the number of electrons, $N$, at a constant external potential, $v(\\mathbf{r})$. The external potential for a molecule is generated by its nuclei, so a constant $v(\\mathbf{r})$ implies that the nuclear positions are fixed.\n$$f(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\partial N}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nThe atom-condensed Fukui function for an atom $k$, denoted $f_k$, is obtained by integrating the Fukui function over the basin of atom $k$, which is achieved by using an atomic weighting function, $w_k(\\mathbf{r})$.\n$$f_k = \\int w_k(\\mathbf{r}) f(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $f(\\mathbf{r})$ gives:\n$$f_k = \\int w_k(\\mathbf{r}) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\partial N}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})} d\\mathbf{r}$$\nAssuming sufficient smoothness of the functions, we can interchange the order of differentiation and integration:\n$$f_k = \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N} \\int w_k(\\mathbf{r}) \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nThe integral within the parentheses is the definition of the electron population on atom $k$, denoted $N_k$.\n$$N_k = \\int w_k(\\mathbf{r}) \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$$\nThus, the condensed Fukui function is the derivative of the atomic electron population with respect to the total number of electrons at constant external potential.\n$$f_k = \\left(\\frac{\\partial N_k}{\\partial N}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nThe partitioned atomic charge, $q_k$, is defined as the nuclear charge, $Z_k$, minus the electron population of the atom, $N_k$.\n$$q_k = Z_k - N_k$$\nThis relation can be rearranged to express $N_k$ in terms of $q_k$: $N_k = Z_k - q_k$. Substituting this into the expression for $f_k$:\n$$f_k = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (Z_k - q_k)}{\\partial N}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nSince the nuclear charge $Z_k$ is a constant with respect to changes in the number of electrons, its derivative is zero.\n$$f_k = - \\left(\\frac{\\partial q_k}{\\partial N}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nThe problem asks for the nucleophilic Fukui function, $f_k^{+}$, which describes the change in electron density upon addition of an electron. This corresponds to a right-sided derivative. Using a finite difference approximation, we evaluate the change from the $N$-electron system to the $(N+1)$-electron system.\n$$f_k^{+} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial N_k}{\\partial N}\\right)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}^{+} \\approx \\frac{N_k(N+1) - N_k(N)}{(N+1) - N} = N_k(N+1) - N_k(N)$$\nUsing the relationship between population and charge, we have:\n$$f_k^{+} \\approx (Z_k - q_k(N+1)) - (Z_k - q_k(N)) = q_k(N) - q_k(N+1)$$\nThe crucial condition is that this derivative must be evaluated at constant external potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$. This means the geometry of the system must not change. Therefore, the charges for both the $N$-electron and $(N+1)$-electron systems must be computed at the same geometry, which is conventionally the geometry of the initial $N$-electron state. This corresponds to a vertical electron attachment. The required expression is thus:\n$$f_k^{+} \\approx q_k(N) - q_k(N+1; \\mathrm{vert})$$\nThis expression correctly uses the data from a fixed-geometry calculation, respecting the constant-$v(\\mathbf{r})$ condition in the definition of the Fukui function.\n\nPart 2: Evaluation of $f_B^{+}$.\nUsing the derived expression and the provided data for atom $B$, we can now calculate the nucleophilic condensed Fukui function.\nThe required data are:\n- Charge on atom $B$ in the $N$-electron species: $q_B(N) = -0.30$.\n- Charge on atom $B$ in the $(N+1)$-electron species at the fixed-$N$ geometry: $q_B(N+1; \\mathrm{vert}) = -0.72$.\n\nApplying the formula:\n$$f_B^{+} \\approx q_B(N) - q_B(N+1; \\mathrm{vert})$$\n$$f_B^{+} \\approx (-0.30) - (-0.72)$$\n$$f_B^{+} \\approx -0.30 + 0.72$$\n$$f_B^{+} \\approx 0.42$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Therefore, $0.42$ is expressed as $0.4200$.\n\nPart 3: Discussion of geometry relaxation.\nThe use of atomic charges from the optimized-$N+1$ geometry, $q_k(N+1; \\mathrm{opt})$, is inconsistent with the strict definition of the Fukui function. The definition $f(\\mathbf{r}) = (\\partial \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) / \\partial N)_{v(\\mathbf{r})}$ mandates that the derivative be taken at constant external potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$, which for a molecule translates to a fixed nuclear geometry. The optimized-$N+1$ geometry is, by definition, different from the initial $N$-electron geometry. A calculation using $q_k(N+1; \\mathrm{opt})$ would correspond to an adiabatic electron attachment, where the nuclei have relaxed to their new equilibrium positions. This violates the constant-$v(\\mathbf{r})$ condition. The quantity calculated this way is sometimes referred to as an \"adiabatic Fukui function,\" which is a distinct concept from the \"vertical\" Fukui function defined by Parr and Yang.\n\nThe numerical value of the condensed Fukui function is influenced by two types of relaxation:\n1.  **Orbital Relaxation**: When an electron is added to the $N$-electron system, even at a fixed geometry, the existing electrons respond to the presence of the new electron and the change in the total electronic count. This causes a change in all molecular orbitals, not just the occupation of a single orbital. This change in the electronic structure is called orbital relaxation. The vertical finite difference approximation, $f_k^{+} \\approx q_k(N) - q_k(N+1; \\mathrm{vert})$, correctly captures this effect because it uses a fully self-consistent charge distribution for the $(N+1)$-electron system at the fixed geometry.\n\n2.  **Geometry Relaxation**: After the vertical electron attachment, the forces on the nuclei are no longer zero. The molecule will relax to a new, lower-energy geometry, that of the optimized anion. This process is geometry relaxation. As the nuclei move, the electron density further redistributes. The difference between the charge $q_k(N+1; \\mathrm{vert})$ and $q_k(N+1; \\mathrm{opt})$ is a direct consequence of this nuclear rearrangement. In this problem, the charge on atom $B$ becomes more negative upon relaxation (from $-0.72$ to $-0.85$). This indicates that the geometry changes in a way that stabilizes the additional negative charge on atom $B$, which is consistent with atom $B$ being the most nucleophilic site as indicated by the highest $f_B^{+}$ value. Therefore, using the optimized geometry data would mix the effects of orbital relaxation and geometry relaxation, leading to a different numerical value that does not correspond to the strict definition of the Fukui function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4200}$$", "id": "2880923"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying reactive sites on a single molecule, conceptual DFT provides elegant models for understanding intermolecular interactions. This practice explores the phenomenon of charge transfer within a donor-acceptor complex, a fundamental process in hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions.
