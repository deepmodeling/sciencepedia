It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe central task is to derive the ratio of the single-molecule canonical partition function of the transition state, $Q^\\ddagger$, to that of the reactant, $Q_R$. The problem specifies that we assume separability of the energy modes, which allows the total partition function for a species to be written as a product of its translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions. For a species $S$ (which will be either the reactant $R$ or the transition state $\\ddagger$), the partition function is:\n$$\nQ_S = Q_{\\text{trans},S} \\, Q_{\\text{rot},S} \\, Q_{\\text{vib},S} \\, Q_{\\text{el},S}\n$$\nHere, energies are measured from the ground state of the respective species, and $Q^\\ddagger$ specifically excludes the degree of freedom corresponding to the reaction coordinate.\n\nFirst, we define the partition function for the reactant molecule, $R$. It is a nonlinear molecule composed of $N$ atoms. It possesses $3$ translational degrees of freedom, $3$ rotational degrees of freedom, and $3N-6$ vibrational degrees of freedom.\n\nThe component partition functions for the reactant $R$ are as follows:\n$1$. The translational partition function for a particle of mass $M$ in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ is:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{trans},R} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi M k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} V\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $h$ is the Planck constant.\n\n$2$.

The problem statement further supports this by assuming that the barrier height $V^\\ddagger$ and classical partition function factors are mass-insensitive. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}(T)}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T)} $$\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the \"leading semiclassical correction valid for an inverted harmonic barrier.\" This is a precise reference to the Wigner tunneling correction, which is the leading term in an expansion of the exact quantum correction in powers of $\\hbar^2$. The Wigner correction is given by:\n$$ \\kappa(T) = 1 + \\frac{1}{24} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\omega^\\ddagger}{k_B T} \\right)^2 $$\nwhere $\\omega^\\ddagger$ is the magnitude of the imaginary angular frequency of the vibrational mode along the reaction coordinate at the saddle point, and $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$.\n\nThe imaginary angular frequency $\\omega^\\ddagger$ depends on the curvature of the potential energy surface, $V''(s^\\ddagger)$, and the effective reduced mass of the reaction coordinate, $\\mu$, as follows:\n$$ \\omega^\\ddagger = \\sqrt{\\frac{|V''(s^\\ddagger)|}{\\mu}} $$\nAs per the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and as stated in the problem, the potential energy surface and its curvature $|V''(s^\\ddagger)|$ are independent of isotopic substitution. The problem provides that the effective mass doubles upon substituting H with D: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} = 2\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\nTherefore, the relationship between the imaginary frequencies for the two isotopologs is:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{D}}^\\ddagger = \\sqrt{\\frac{|V''(s^\\ddagger)|}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{|V''(s^\\ddagger)|}{2\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{|V''(s^\\ddagger)|}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}}}} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nLet us define the dimensionless quantity $u = \\hbar \\omega^\\ddagger / (k_B T)$. The transmission coefficients for the H and D species can be expressed in terms of $u_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger}{k_B T} $$\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{\\mathrm{D}}^\\ddagger}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger/\\sqrt{2})}{k_B T} = \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nSubstituting these into the Wigner correction formula gives:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{24} u_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 $$\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{24} u_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{24} \\left(\\frac{u_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{H}}^2}{48} $$\n\nThe KIE is then the ratio of these two expressions:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{1 + u_{\\mathrm{H}}^2/24}{1 + u_{\\mathrm{H}}^2/48} $$\n\nWe must now calculate the numerical value of $u_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The imaginary frequency is given as a wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger = 1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The quantity $u_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is related to $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger$ by $u_{\\mathrm{H}} = h c \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger / (k_B T)$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\nGiven the values:\n$T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\ddagger = 1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n$h \\approx 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$\n$c \\approx 2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nWe compute $u_{\\mathrm{H}}$:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) (2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) (1000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (300\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 4.795995 $$\nAnd its square:\n$$ u_{\\mathrm{H}}^2 \\approx (4.795995)^2 \\approx 23.00157 $$\n\nWe substitute this value back into the expression for the KIE:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{23.00157}{24}}{1 + \\frac{23.00157}{48}} = \\frac{1 + 0.9583988}{1 + 0.4791994} = \\frac{1.9583988}{1.4791994} \\approx 1.323956 $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested yields the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.324}$$", "id": "2934342"}]}
