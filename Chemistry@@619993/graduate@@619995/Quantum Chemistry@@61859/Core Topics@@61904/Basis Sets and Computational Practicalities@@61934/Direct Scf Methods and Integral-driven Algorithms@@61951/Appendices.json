Specifically, it is equivalent to the graph coloring problem.\n\nLet us construct a **conflict graph** $G = (V, E)$, where:\n- The set of vertices $V$ corresponds to the set of tasks $\\{T_k\\}$.\n- The set of edges $E$ connects pairs of tasks that have a write conflict. An undirected edge exists between two distinct vertices representing tasks $T_a$ and $T_b$ if and only if these tasks conflict.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, a conflict between $T_a$ and $T_b$ occurs if their memory access patterns overlap. This is formalized as:\n$$(T_a, T_b) \\in E \\iff (J_a^{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cap J_b^{\\mathrm{eff}} \\neq \\varnothing) \\lor (K_a \\cap K_b \\neq \\varnothing)$$\nwhere $J_k^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the symmetrized set of indices for task $T_k$'s update to the $J$ matrix, defined as:\n$$J_k^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\bigcup_{(i,j) \\in J_k} \\{(i,j), (j,i)\\}$$\nThe set of indices for the $K$ matrix, $K_k$, is used directly as given. For computational efficiency, these index collections for each task are best represented as sets.\n\nWith this graph model, we can address the required calculations:\n\n1.  **Count of Conflicting Pairs ($C_{\\mathrm{pairs}}$)**: This metric is simply the number of edges in the conflict graph $G$. It can be calculated by iterating through all unique unordered pairs of tasks $\\{T_a, T_b\\}$ and incrementing a counter if the conflict condition is met. This quantifies the total inherent parallelism constraint in the task set.\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{pairs}} = |E| = \\sum_{a=0}^{|V|-2} \\sum_{b=a+1}^{|V|-1} \\mathbb{I}((T_a, T_b) \\in E)$$\n    where $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, which is $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise.\n\n2.  **Task Partitioning**: A partition of tasks into conflict-free batches is equivalent to a valid coloring of the graph $G$. All tasks within a single batch are assigned the same \"color,\" and the core constraint of graph coloring is that no two adjacent vertices (conflicting tasks) can have the same color. The problem does not require finding the chromatic number of the graph (the minimum number of batches), which is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, a simple and efficient **greedy coloring algorithm** is sufficient and appropriate.\n\n    The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    a. Order the tasks sequentially, for instance, $T_0, T_1, \\dots, T_{|V|-1}$.\n    b. Initialize an empty list of batches, $\\mathcal{B} = []$.\n    c. For each task $T_i$ in sequence:\n        i. Attempt to place $T_i$ into an existing batch $B_m \\in \\mathcal{B}$.\n        ii. A task $T_i$ can be placed in batch $B_m$ if it does not conflict with any task $T_j$ already in $B_m$. That is, for all $T_j \\in B_m$, the edge $(T_i, T_j)$ must not be in $E$.\n        iii. Iterate through the existing batches $B_0, B_1, \\dots$. If a suitable batch is found, place $T_i$ in it and proceed to the next task, $T_{i+1}$.\n        iv. If $T_i$ cannot be placed in any existing batch, create a new batch containing only $T_i$ and add it to the list $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n    This procedure guarantees a valid, conflict-free partition.\n\n3.  **Final Metrics**:\n    - **$M$ (Number of Batches)**: This is simply the final number of batches created by the greedy algorithm, $|\\mathcal{B}|$.\n    - **$\\mathrm{cf}$ (Conflict-Free Indicator)**: By the very construction of the greedy coloring algorithm, the resulting partition is conflict-free. Therefore, this value will always be $1$. We can include a verification step to confirm this as a measure of algorithmic correctness.\n    - **$S_{\\max}$ (Maximum Batch Size)**: This is the size of the largest batch in the partition, $\\max_{B_m \\in \\mathcal{B}} |B_m|$.
