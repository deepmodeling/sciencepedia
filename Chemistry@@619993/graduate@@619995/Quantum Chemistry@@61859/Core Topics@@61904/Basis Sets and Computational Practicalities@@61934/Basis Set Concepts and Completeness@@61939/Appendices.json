It presents a standard, verifiable set of tasks in the field of quantum chemistry and linear algebra, with all necessary data and definitions provided. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\na) The overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is a Gram matrix, with elements $S_{ij} = \\langle \\chi_i \\mid \\chi_j \\rangle$. Since the basis functions are elements of a Hilbert space, the inner product $\\langle \\cdot \\mid \\cdot \\rangle$ ensures that $\\mathbf{S}$ is Hermitian (or symmetric for real basis functions) and positive semi-definite. For a linearly independent basis set, $\\mathbf{S}$ is positive definite.\n\nThe Rayleigh-Ritz principle states that for a Hermitian matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, its smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{A})$ is given by the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\neq\\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}^\\dagger \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}}{\\mathbf{x}^\\dagger \\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nWe apply this principle to the overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ with a coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N}$, whose elements are $\\{c_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$. The Rayleigh quotient for $\\mathbf{S}$ is $\\frac{\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}}{\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{c}}$.\n\nLet us analyze the numerator, $\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}$. By definition of matrix multiplication, this is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_i^* S_{ij} c_j$.

Therefore, the existence of such a near-vanishing linear combination forces $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S})$ to be close to zero. The approach to completeness through adding more functions eventually introduces such near-redundancies, which manifests as the overlap matrix having very small eigenvalues.\n\nb) We are given two normalized Gaussian functions in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$:\n$$\n\\chi_{1}(x) = \\mathcal{N}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha x^{2}}{2}\\right), \\quad \\chi_{2}(x) = \\mathcal{N}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha (x-\\delta)^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nwith $\\mathcal{N} = (\\alpha/\\pi)^{1/4}$.

The off-diagonal elements are $\\langle \\chi_1 \\mid \\chi_2 \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_2 \\mid \\chi_1 \\rangle = s(\\alpha, \\delta) = s$. The overlap matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s \\\\ s & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda & s \\\\ s & 1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda)^2 - s^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $(1-\\lambda-s)(1-\\lambda+s) = 0$. The eigenvalues are therefore $\\lambda_1 = 1+s$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1-s$.\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\delta > 0$, we have $s = \\exp(-\\alpha\\delta^2/4)$, which implies $0 < s < 1$. Thus, the eigenvalues are both positive.\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{S}) = 1+s$, and the smallest is $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S}) = 1-s$.\nThe spectral condition number $\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S})$ is the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{S})}{\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S})} = \\frac{1+s}{1-s}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s(\\alpha, \\delta)$:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S}) = \\frac{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}\\right)}\n$$\nNow we analyze the behavior as $\\delta \\to 0$. As $\\delta$ approaches $0$, the exponent $-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}$ approaches $0$, and thus $s = \\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4})$ approaches $\\exp(0) = 1$.\nPhysically, $\\delta \\to 0$ means $\\chi_2(x) \\to \\chi_1(x)$, and the two basis functions become identical, i.e., linearly dependent. Their overlap $s$ correctly approaches $1$.\nIn this limit, the condition number behaves as:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\delta\\to 0} \\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S}) = \\lim_{s\\to 1^{-}} \\frac{1+s}{1-s} = \\frac{2}{0^{+}} = \\infty\n$$\nAn infinite or very large condition number signifies that the matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is singular or ill-conditioned.

For an ill-conditioned matrix, these numerical procedures are highly unstable. Small numerical errors in the elements of $\\mathbf{S}$ are magnified enormously during inversion or factorization, leading to large, unreliable errors in the computed eigenvalues $\\epsilon$ and eigenvectors $\\mathbf{c}$.

It represents a standard and significant problem in theoretical quantum chemistry concerning the evaluation of basis set incompleteness error. The framework provided, utilizing LÃ¶wdin partitioning, is appropriate for deriving the leading-order error. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find the leading-order error in the expectation value of a one-body operator $A$, denoted $\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle$, which arises from the use of a finite basis set. This error is defined as\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle = \\langle A \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle_{P} = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\gamma A) - \\operatorname{Tr}(\\gamma_{P} A) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\big[(\\gamma - \\gamma_{P}) A\\big]\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} |i\\rangle \\langle i|$ is the exact one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) and $\\gamma_{P} = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} |i_{P}\\rangle \\langle i_{P}|$ is its finite-basis approximation. The factor of $2$ accounts for spin in a closed-shell system.\n\nOur first step is to establish the relationship between an exact occupied orbital $|i\\rangle$ and its finite-basis approximation $|i_{P}\\rangle$. The exact orbital satisfies the SchrÃ¶dinger equation in the full Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$:\n$$\nH |i\\rangle = \\varepsilon_{i} |i\\rangle\n$$\nWe introduce the projection operators $P$ and $Q = I - P$ for the basis set subspace $\\mathcal{P}$ and its orthogonal complement $\\mathcal{Q}$, respectively. Applying the identity $I = P+Q$ to the eigenvector $|i\\rangle$ gives $|i\\rangle = P|i\\rangle + Q|i\\rangle$. We can transform the single eigenvalue equation into a system of two coupled equations by applying $P$ and $Q$ from the left:\n$$\nP(P+Q)H(P+Q)|i\\rangle = \\varepsilon_{i} P|i\\rangle \\implies PHP(P|i\\rangle) + PHQ(Q|i\\rangle) = \\varepsilon_{i} (P|i\\rangle)\n$$\n$$\nQ(P+Q)H(P+Q)|i\\rangle = \\varepsilon_{i} Q|i\\rangle \\implies QHP(P|i\\rangle) + QHQ(Q|i\\rangle) = \\varepsilon_{i} (Q|i\\rangle)\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we solve for the component of the eigenvector in the complementary space, $Q|i\\rangle$:\n$$\n(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ) (Q|i\\rangle) = QHP (P|i\\rangle)\n$$\nThe problem states that the operator $(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)$ is invertible on the subspace $\\mathcal{Q}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nQ|i\\rangle = (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} QHP (P|i\\rangle)\n$$\nThe full eigenvector can therefore be expressed in terms of its projection onto $\\mathcal{P}$:\n$$\n|i\\rangle = P|i\\rangle + Q|i\\rangle = \\left( P + (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} QHP \\right) (P|i\\rangle)\n$$\nThis expression is exact. For a first-order treatment, we relate the exact component $P|i\\rangle$ to the approximate orbital $|i_{P}\\rangle$. The approximate orbital $|i_{P}\\rangle$ is obtained from solving the eigenvalue problem projected onto the subspace $\\mathcal{P}$: $PHP |i_{P}\\rangle = \\varepsilon_{i} |i_{P}\\rangle$. The zeroth-order approximation to the exact state $|i\\rangle$ is $|i_{P}\\rangle$. Therefore, to first order in the coupling between $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ (which is described by operators $PHQ$ and $QHP$), we can approximate $P|i\\rangle \\approx |i_{P}\\rangle$. Substituting this into the expression for $|i\\rangle$ yields the first-order corrected orbital:\n$$\n|i\\rangle \\approx \\left( P + Q(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}QH P \\right) |i_{P}\\rangle\n$$\nSince $|i_{P}\\rangle$ is in the subspace $\\mathcal{P}$, we have $P|i_{P}\\rangle = |i_{P}\\rangle$. The operators $QHP$ and $QH$ acting on $|i_{P}\\rangle$ are equivalent, as $QHP|i_{P}\\rangle = QH(P|i_{P}\\rangle) = QH|i_{P}\\rangle$. Thus:\n$$\n|i\\rangle \\approx |i_{P}\\rangle + Q(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}QH|i_{P}\\rangle\n$$\nThe first-order error in the orbital is $\\Delta |i\\rangle = |i\\rangle - |i_{P}\\rangle \\approx Q(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}QH|i_{P}\\rangle$.\n\nNow, we compute the first-order error in the projector onto the $i$-th occupied state, $\\Delta \\gamma_{i} = |i\\rangle\\langle i| - |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}|$. Keeping only terms up to first order in the perturbation:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma_{i} \\approx \\big( |i_{P}\\rangle + \\Delta|i\\rangle \\big) \\big( \\langle i_{P}| + \\langle \\Delta i| \\big) - |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| \\approx |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle\\Delta i| + |\\Delta i\\rangle\\langle i_{P}|\n$$\nThe operators $H$ and $Q$ are Hermitian, and $\\varepsilon_{i}$ is real, making the operator $(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}$ also Hermitian. The adjoint of the orbital error is $\\langle\\Delta i| = \\langle i_{P}| H Q (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} Q$. Inserting these into the expression for $\\Delta \\gamma_{i}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma_{i} \\approx |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| H Q (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} Q + Q(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}QH|i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}|\n$$\nThe total error in the 1-RDM, $\\Delta \\gamma = \\gamma - \\gamma_{P}$, is obtained by summing over all occupied orbitals and multiplying by the spin factor of $2$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\gamma = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\Delta \\gamma_{i} \\approx 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\left( |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| H Q (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} Q + Q(\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}QH|i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the error in the expectation value $\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\Delta\\gamma A)$. Using the linearity and cyclic property of the trace ($\\operatorname{Tr}(XY) = \\operatorname{Tr}(YX)$ and $\\operatorname{Tr}(|u\\rangle\\langle v| Z) = \\langle v|Z|u\\rangle$):\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle = \\operatorname{Tr} \\left[ 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\left( |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| H Q R_{i} Q + Q R_{i} Q H |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| \\right) A \\right]\n$$\nwhere for brevity we denote $R_{i} = (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\left[ \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| H Q R_{i} Q A \\right) + \\operatorname{Tr}\\left( Q R_{i} Q H |i_{P}\\rangle\\langle i_{P}| A \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\left[ \\langle i_{P}| H Q R_{i} Q A |i_{P}\\rangle + \\langle i_{P}| A Q R_{i} Q H |i_{P}\\rangle \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting back the full expression for $R_{i}$, we obtain the final expression for the leading-order basis set incompleteness error for a one-body property:\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle A \\rangle = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} \\left( \\langle i_{P}| H Q (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} Q A |i_{P}\\rangle + \\langle i_{P}| A Q (\\varepsilon_{i} - QHQ)^{-1} Q H |i_{P}\\rangle \\right)\n$$\nThis expression contains the specified quantities and represents the consolidated result of the first-order analysis.
