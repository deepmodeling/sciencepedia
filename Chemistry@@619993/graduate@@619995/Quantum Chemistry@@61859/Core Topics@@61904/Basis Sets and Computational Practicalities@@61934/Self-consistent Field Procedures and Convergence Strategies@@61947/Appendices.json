Your task is to implement a single macro-iteration of a restricted Hartree–Fock self-consistent field (RHF-SCF) procedure starting from an initial density matrix. Begin from the variational principle for the electronic energy with orthonormal molecular orbitals and the definition of the Fock operator in the restricted, closed-shell case. Derive the generalized eigenvalue problem that arises in a non-orthogonal atomic orbital basis and the corresponding rule for constructing the closed-shell density matrix from the occupied molecular orbitals. Then, using these derived relations, perform one macro-iteration consisting of: forming the Fock matrix from the initial density, solving the generalized eigenvalue problem to obtain molecular orbitals, and updating the density matrix with proper closed-shell orbital occupations. Finally, compute the updated electronic energy using the updated density and the corresponding Fock matrix. Ignore the nuclear repulsion energy and report only the electronic energy. All quantities are in atomic units (Hartree for energy).\n\nThe fundamental base you must use includes: the Hartree–Fock variational principle for many-electron systems, orthonormality of molecular orbitals in a non-orthogonal basis expressed via an overlap matrix, the closed-shell electron counting rule in the restricted Hartree–Fock formalism, and the definition of Coulomb and exchange contributions constructed from two-electron repulsion integrals in chemist’s notation. You must not assume any pre-specified shortcut formulas beyond what follows from these principles.\n\nDetails and conventions:\n- Work in the atomic orbital basis with an overlap matrix $S$, a core Hamiltonian matrix $H$, and electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) in chemist’s notation $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma)$.\n- Use the restricted closed-shell formalism: there are $N_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ electrons, all paired, so the number of occupied spatial orbitals is $N_{\\mathrm{occ}} = N_{\\mathrm{elec}}/2$.\n- The ERIs obey full permutational symmetry: $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma) = (\\nu\\mu|\\lambda\\sigma) = (\\mu\\nu|\\sigma\\lambda) = (\\lambda\\sigma|\\mu\\nu)$, and missing quartets not listed have value $0$.\n- Indices are zero-based: $\\mu,\\nu,\\lambda,\\sigma \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,n_{\\mathrm{bf}}-1\\}$.\n- Perform a single macro-iteration as follows: \n  1. From the initial density matrix $P^{(0)}$, form the Fock matrix $F^{(0)}$ appropriate for restricted Hartree–Fock in a non-orthogonal atomic orbital basis, using the Coulomb and exchange constructions implied by the variational principle and the given ERIs.\n  2. Solve the generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem $F^{(0)} C = S C \\varepsilon$ to obtain molecular orbital coefficients $C$ that are orthonormal with respect to $S$.\n  3. Determine the $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ lowest-energy occupied orbitals and build the updated closed-shell density matrix $P^{(1)}$ from these orbitals in the atomic orbital basis.\n  4. Using $P^{(1)}$, form the corresponding Fock matrix $F^{(1)}$ and evaluate the electronic energy after this macro-iteration as implied by the Hartree–Fock energy functional in terms of $H$, $F^{(1)}$, and $P^{(1)}$, expressed in atomic units (Hartree).\n- You must express the final energies as floats rounded to ten decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nImplement your program to process the following three test cases internally. For each case, carry out exactly one macro-iteration as described and report the final electronic energy (excluding nuclear repulsion) in Hartree.

It presents a well-defined task in computational quantum chemistry, grounded in the fundamental principles of the Hartree-Fock approximation. All necessary data and constraints are provided, and the problem is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation followed by the algorithmic implementation.\n\nThe objective is to perform a single macro-iteration of the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. The foundation of this method is the variational principle, which dictates that the true ground-state energy of a many-electron system is the minimum of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the trial wavefunction is restricted to a single Slater determinant. For a closed-shell system with $N_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ electrons, this leads to an energy functional that depends on the $N_{\\mathrm{occ}} = N_{\\mathrm{elec}}/2$ doubly-occupied spatial molecular orbitals (MOs), $\\{\\psi_i\\}$.\n\nThe MOs, $\\psi_i$, are expressed as a linear combination of a set of $n_{\\mathrm{bf}}$ non-orthogonal atomic orbitals (AOs), $\\{\\phi_\\mu\\}$, through the LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) approximation:\n$$ \\psi_i = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{bf}}} C_{\\mu i} \\phi_\\mu $$\nwhere $C_{\\mu i}$ are the MO coefficients. The non-orthogonality of the AO basis is described by the overlap matrix $S$, with elements $S_{\\mu\\nu} = \\langle \\phi_\\mu | \\phi_\\nu \\rangle$. The MOs are constrained to be orthonormal, which in the AO basis translates to the matrix equation:\n$$ C^T S C = I $$\nwhere $C$ is the $n_{\\mathrm{bf}} \\times n_{\\mathrm{bf}}$ matrix of MO coefficients and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nThe electronic energy functional in the RHF formalism can be expressed in terms of the one-electron density matrix $P$. In the AO basis, the elements of the density matrix for a closed-shell system are defined as:\n$$ P_{\\mu\\nu} = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} C_{\\mu i} C_{\\nu i} $$\nThe factor of $2$ accounts for the double occupation of each spatial orbital.\n\nMinimizing the energy functional with respect to the MO coefficients $C_{\\mu i}$ under the orthonormality constraint leads to the Roothaan-Hall equations, a generalized eigenvalue problem:\n$$ F C = S C \\varepsilon $$\nHere, $F$ is the Fock matrix, and $\\varepsilon$ is a diagonal matrix of the MO energies. The Fock matrix $F$ is the matrix representation of the effective one-electron Fock operator in the AO basis. Its elements are given by:\n$$ F_{\\mu\\nu} = H_{\\mu\\nu} + G_{\\mu\\nu} $$\nwhere $H_{\\mu\\nu} = \\langle \\phi_\\mu | \\hat{h} | \\phi_\\nu \\rangle$ are the elements of the core Hamiltonian matrix, representing the kinetic energy and electron-nuclear attraction of a single electron. The matrix $G$ represents the average two-electron potential (Coulomb and exchange) experienced by an electron. Its elements, $G_{\\mu\\nu}$, are constructed from the density matrix $P$ and the two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs), $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma)$:\n$$ G_{\\mu\\nu} = \\sum_{\\lambda=0}^{n_{\\mathrm{bf}}-1} \\sum_{\\sigma=0}^{n_{\\mathrm{bf}}-1} P_{\\lambda\\sigma} \\left[ (\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma) \\right] $$\nThe term $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma)$ corresponds to the Coulomb interaction, while $(\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma)$ corresponds to the exchange interaction. Note the indices in chemist's notation for the ERIs.\n\nThe SCF procedure is an iterative process. Starting with an initial guess for the density matrix, one constructs the Fock matrix, solves the Roothaan-Hall equations to obtain new MO coefficients, and then constructs a new density matrix. This process is repeated until the density matrix or energy converges. The problem requires a single such iteration.\n\nThe specific steps for one macro-iteration are as follows:\n$1$. **Fock Matrix Construction**: Given an initial density matrix $P^{(0)}$, the initial Fock matrix $F^{(0)}$ is constructed. Its elements are:\n$$ F_{\\mu\\nu}^{(0)} = H_{\\mu\\nu} + \\sum_{\\lambda,\\sigma} P_{\\lambda\\sigma}^{(0)} \\left[ (\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma) \\right] $$\nPrior to this step, the full four-index ERI tensor must be constructed from the provided list of unique integrals using the specified permutational symmetry rules: $(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma) = (\\nu\\mu|\\lambda\\sigma) = (\\mu\\nu|\\sigma\\lambda) = (\\lambda\\sigma|\\mu\\nu)$.\n\n$2$. **Solve the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem**: The Roothaan-Hall equations $F^{(0)} C = S C \\varepsilon$ are solved. This yields a set of $n_{\\mathrm{bf}}$ orbital energies (the eigenvalues $\\varepsilon_{i}$) and the corresponding MO coefficient vectors (the columns of matrix $C$). The eigenvectors $C$ are normalized such that $C^T S C = I$.\n\n$3$. **Update the Density Matrix**: The MOs are ordered according to their energies in ascending order. The $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ orbitals with the lowest energies are the occupied orbitals. The new density matrix, $P^{(1)}$, is constructed from the coefficients of these occupied orbitals:\n$$ P_{\\mu\\nu}^{(1)} = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}} C_{\\mu i} C_{\\nu i} $$\nIn matrix algebra, if $C_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ is the $n_{\\mathrm{bf}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ matrix containing the first $N_{\\mathrm{occ}}$ columns of $C$, then $P^{(1)} = 2 C_{\\mathrm{occ}} C_{\\mathrm{occ}}^T$.\n\n$4$. **Calculate the Final Electronic Energy**: The electronic energy after one iteration is calculated using the updated density matrix $P^{(1)}$ and a Fock matrix $F^{(1)}$ constructed from it. The formula for the electronic energy is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{elec}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu}^{(1)} (H_{\\mu\\nu} + F_{\\mu\\nu}^{(1)}) $$\nwhere $F^{(1)}$ is computed in the same manner as $F^{(0)}$, but using $P^{(1)}$:\n$$ F_{\\mu\\nu}^{(1)} = H_{\\mu\\nu} + \\sum_{\\lambda,\\sigma} P_{\\lambda\\sigma}^{(1)} \\left[ (\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma) \\right] $$\nThis calculation provides the electronic energy after a single SCF step, which is the required output. The nuclear repulsion energy is a constant offset and is ignored as per the problem statement.

This method is a cornerstone for accelerating convergence in self-consistent field calculations in quantum chemistry. The problem is scientifically grounded, formally specified, and contains all required data for a unique solution. We will proceed with the formal derivation and implementation.\n\nThe core of the DIIS method is to find a linear combination of previous Fock-like matrices, $\\mathbf{F}_i$, that minimizes the norm of the corresponding linear combination of residual matrices, $\\mathbf{r}_i$. The coefficients of this combination must sum to one to ensure that if all previous iterates were the solution, the new iterate would also be the solution.

This scenario is known to be computationally challenging due to the near-degeneracy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), which results in a small energy gap. A successful protocol must be robust in the initial stages of the calculation and efficient in the final stages, while properly managing stabilization techniques. The evaluation will be based on the provided first principles, including the distinct roles and domains of applicability for Energy-Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (EDIIS) and Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS), the function of level shifting, and the meaning of various convergence metrics.\n\nLet us analyze each option methodically.\n\n**Option A:** This protocol specifies starting with EDIIS, employing a moderate level shift and damping, switching to DIIS based on physically meaningful thresholds, and then removing the level shift to converge to the true solution.\n*   **Initial Strategy:** The calculation begins with EDIIS. According to the provided principles, EDIIS is robust far from the solution because it leverages the variational principle by constructing a convex combination of density matrices to guarantee or promote a non-increasing energy sequence. For a difficult case like a stretched bond, this is the correct starting choice to ensure stable progress towards the general vicinity of a minimum.\n*   **Stabilization:** A level shift of $\\lambda = 0.5 \\ \\text{hartree}$ is applied. This is a crucial stabilization technique for systems with small HOMO–LUMO gaps. By adding a positive constant to the diagonal elements of the virtual-virtual block of the Fock matrix, it effectively increases the energy gap, damping the otherwise unstable rotations between near-degenerate occupied and virtual orbitals. A value of $0.5 \\ \\text{hartree}$ is a moderate and reasonable choice. A damping factor of $0.3$ on the density update provides additional stability.\n*   **Switching Criteria:** The switch to DIIS occurs when $\\lVert R \\rVert_{\\mathrm{F}} < 10^{-2}$, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{RMS}} < 10^{-3}$, and $|\\Delta E| < 10^{-4} \\ \\text{hartree}$ for $3$ consecutive iterations. The Pulay residual norm, $\\lVert R \\rVert_{\\mathrm{F}}$, directly measures the non-commutativity of the Fock and density matrices and thus the proximity to a stationary point. A threshold of $10^{-2}$ is a standard and well-justified value for entering the locally linear regime where DIIS becomes effective. The conditions on the density matrix and energy changes provide further confirmation of stability. Requiring the conditions to hold for $3$ iterations is a sound heuristic to prevent a premature switch.\n*   **Late-stage Acceleration:** Upon switching, the protocol ramps the level shift $\\lambda$ down to $0$. This is fundamentally important. The level shift is a temporary modification of the problem. To converge to the stationary point of the *original* Hartree–Fock energy functional, this perturbation must be removed once stability is achieved. Using a DIIS subspace of size $m = 8$ is reasonable for effective acceleration.\n*   **Conclusion:** This protocol is comprehensive, well-reasoned, and scientifically sound. It correctly applies the right methods (EDIIS, DIIS) in the appropriate regimes and uses stabilization techniques (level shifting) correctly, including their necessary removal.\n\n**Option B:** This protocol suggests starting directly with DIIS and using EDIIS only as a temporary \"rescue\" mechanism.\n*   **Initial Strategy:** Starting with DIIS is a poor choice for this problem. DIIS assumes the error can be minimized via linear extrapolation, a condition that holds only near the solution. In the initial, highly non-linear phase of a stretched-bond calculation, DIIS is prone to taking large, erratic steps that can lead to energy increase, oscillation, or outright divergence.\n*   **Stabilization:** The protocol omits both level shifting and damping. This is a critical failure. For a system with a small HOMO–LUMO gap, convergence without stabilization is highly unlikely.\n*   **Control Logic:** The reactive approach of using a single EDIIS step only after DIIS fails for $2$ consecutive iterations is not a robust strategy. It indicates a fundamentally flawed initial choice, which is then patched up inefficiently.\n*   **Conclusion:** This protocol is inappropriate for the problem. It misapplies the DIIS method and omits essential stabilization techniques.\n\n**Option C:** This protocol starts with a heavily stabilized EDIIS and uses extremely strict switching criteria.\n*   **Stabilization:** It proposes \"heavy damping of $0.2$\" and a \"large level shift of $\\lambda = 3.0 \\ \\text{hartree}$\". While this will certainly stabilize the calculation, it is likely overkill. Such a large level shift severely distorts the energy landscape, and heavy damping makes progress exceedingly slow.\n*   **Switching Criteria:** The switch to DIIS is set at $\\lVert R \\rVert_{\\mathrm{F}} < 10^{-6}$, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{RMS}} < 10^{-8}$, and $|\\Delta E| < 10^{-8} \\ \\text{hartree}$. These are typical values for final convergence, not for switching from a global to a local method. The entire purpose of DIIS is to accelerate the convergence from an intermediate point (e.g., $\\lVert R \\rVert_{\\mathrm{F}} \\sim 10^{-2}$) to the final solution. By waiting until the calculation is practically converged, the switch to DIIS becomes pointless and the overall procedure is extremely inefficient.\n*   **Late-stage Acceleration:** A small DIIS subspace of $m = 2$ limits the effectiveness of the method. Critically, the protocol specifies keeping the level shift constant. This is a fundamental error. Converging with a non-zero level shift means the final result is a stationary point of a modified Hamiltonian, not the true Hartree–Fock solution.\n*   **Conclusion:** This protocol is both extremely inefficient and conceptually incorrect, as it converges to the wrong answer.\n\n**Option D:** This protocol suggests a very rapid switch to DIIS while maintaining the level shift.\n*   **Switching Criteria:** The criterion \"switch... after $2$ iterations, whichever occurs first\" is reckless and arbitrary. For a difficult problem, it is almost certain that the SCF will not be in the locally linear regime after only $2$ steps. This would trigger a premature switch to an aggressive DIIS method, which is likely to fail.\n*   **Control Logic:** The instruction \"Do not enforce energy monotonicity in either phase\" is problematic. While DIIS does not inherently guarantee monotonicity, the variational nature of EDIIS is its key strength. Not leveraging this in the initial phase is a poor strategy.\n*   **Late-stage Acceleration:** As with option C, keeping the level shift fixed ($\\lambda = 1.0 \\ \\text{hartree}$) is a fatal flaw. The method would converge to a solution for a perturbed problem, which is incorrect.\n*   **Conclusion:** This protocol is flawed due to its dangerous switching heuristic and its failure to converge to the correct physical solution by not removing the level shift.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nBased on a rigorous analysis against the provided first principles, Option A is the only protocol that represents a physically and numerically sound strategy. It correctly balances robustness (EDIIS start), stabilization (moderate level shifting), and efficiency (DIIS acceleration), while ensuring correctness by removing the artificial stabilization to converge to the true RHF solution. The other options contain fundamental conceptual errors, such as applying methods outside their domain of validity, using nonsensical parameters, or converging to an incorrect solution.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2923073"}]}
