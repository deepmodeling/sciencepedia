In the Pople-style STO-$n$G family, an STO-$3$G basis replaces each Slater-type orbital by a contraction of $3$ primitive Gaussian functions, but the counting of contracted functions refers to the number of contracted basis functions, not the number of primitive Gaussians. For second-row main-group atoms, the valence shell contains both $s$- and $p$-type atomic orbitals; the Pople convention uses a shared-exponent $sp$-contraction for the valence shell that yields separate $s$- and $p$-type contracted functions with a common radial part. For hydrogen, only the $1s$ shell is present. For angular momentum $l=1$ ($p$-type), there are $3$ angular components whether one uses spherical harmonics or Cartesian Gaussians, whereas for $l \\geq 2$ the counts differ.\n\nStarting from these definitions and facts, determine the total number of contracted Gaussian basis functions in the STO-$3$G minimal basis for methane (one carbon atom bound to four hydrogen atoms).

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique, correct answer. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the total number of contracted Gaussian basis functions for the methane molecule, $\\text{CH}_4$, using the STO-$3$G minimal basis set. The core principle of a minimal basis set is that it provides precisely one basis function for each atomic orbital occupied in the ground-state electron configuration of the neutral atom. The designation STO-$3$G indicates that each of these basis functions is constructed from a linear combination (a contraction) of $3$ primitive Gaussian functions, but the quantity to be counted is the number of final contracted functions, not the primitives.\n\nWe analyze the contributions from each atom in the molecule.\n\nFirst, consider the carbon atom, $C$. The atomic number of carbon is $Z=6$. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$, $2s$, and $2p$ orbitals.\n\n1.  **Core Shell:** The core shell is the $n=1$ shell, which contains the $1s$ orbital. According to the minimal basis set definition, this single occupied core orbital is represented by one contracted basis function. This function is of $s$-type symmetry. Thus, the carbon core contributes $1$ basis function.\n\n2.  **Valence Shell:** The valence shell for a second-row atom like carbon is the $n=2$ shell, which contains the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals.\n    *   The $2s$ orbital is represented by one contracted basis function of $s$-type symmetry.\n    *   The $2p$ subshell consists of three degenerate orbitals, typically denoted $2p_x$, $2p_y$, and $2p_z$. Each of these occupied orbitals requires one basis function. Therefore, the $2p$ subshell is represented by three contracted basis functions of $p$-type symmetry.\n    *   As stated in the problem, for angular momentum $l=1$ ($p$-type orbitals), the number of angular components is $3$. This holds true whether one employs real spherical harmonics ($p_0, p_{+1c}, p_{-1c}$) or Cartesian Gaussians ($p_x, p_y, p_z$), which is the standard convention for Pople-style basis sets. Our calculation relies on this equivalence, using the count of $3$ functions for the $p$-shell.\n\nIn total, the number of contracted basis functions for the single carbon atom is the sum of contributions from its core and valence shells: $1$ (for $1s$) + $1$ (for $2s$) + $3$ (for $2p$) = $5$ basis functions.\n\nNext, consider the hydrogen atoms, $H$. The atomic number of hydrogen is $Z=1$. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^1$. The only occupied atomic orbital is the $1s$ orbital. Consequently, for each hydrogen atom, a minimal basis set provides one contracted basis function of $s$-type symmetry to represent this orbital.\n\nThe methane molecule, $\\text{CH}_4$, consists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. To find the total number of basis functions for the molecule, we sum the contributions from all constituent atoms.\n\nTotal number of functions = (Functions on $C$) + $4 \\times$ (Functions on $H$)\n$$ \\text{Total} = 5 + 4 \\times 1 $$\n$$ \\text{Total} = 5 + 4 $$\n$$ \\text{Total} = 9 $$\n\nTherefore, the STO-$3$G minimal basis set for the methane molecule comprises a total of $9$ contracted Gaussian basis functions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "2905288"}, {"introduction": "A minimal basis set, while conceptually simple, often lacks the flexibility needed for accurate chemical predictions.

The total number of basis functions defines the dimension of the matrices used in the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field procedure, such as the Fock matrix.\n\nThe notation `X-YZG` for a basis set provides a prescription for constructing contracted Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) from primitive Gaussian functions.\n- The core atomic orbitals are described by a single contracted GTO, which is a fixed linear combination of $X$ primitive GTOs.\n- The valence atomic orbitals are described by a \"split\" representation, meaning they are represented by two basis functions per atomic orbital. The inner part is a contracted GTO composed of $Y$ primitives, and the outer part is a contracted GTO composed of $Z$ primitives.\n\nWe must apply this rule to each atom in the molecule.\n\n**1. Oxygen Atom ($\\mathrm{O}$)**\n\nOxygen is a second-row atom with atomic number $Z=8$ and electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$.\n- **Core orbitals:** The $1s$ orbital.\n- **Valence orbitals:** The $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals.\n\nApplying the `3-21G` scheme to the oxygen atom:\n- The core $1s$ orbital is described by a single contracted function, constructed from $3$ primitive Gaussian functions. This contributes one contracted $s$-type basis function. We denote this as $1s'$.\n- The valence shell ($2s$ and $2p$) is split.\n    - An inner valence part is described by one set of contracted functions, each constructed from $2$ primitive Gaussians. This provides one $s$-type function ($2s_{in}'$) and one set of $p$-type functions ($2p_{in}'$).\n    - An outer valence part is described by another set of contracted functions, each constructed from $1$ primitive Gaussian. This provides one $s$-type function ($2s_{out}'$) and one set of $p$-type functions ($2p_{out}'$).\n\nNow, we count the total number of basis functions on the oxygen atom.\n- **$s$-type functions:** We have one from the core ($1s'$) and two from the split-valence shell ($2s_{in}'$ and $2s_{out}'$). The total count of $s$-type basis functions on oxygen is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n- **$p$-type functions:** There are no $p$-orbitals in the core shell. The valence shell provides two sets of $p$-functions, one inner ($2p_{in}'$) and one outer ($2p_{out}'$). The problem specifies the use of spherical-harmonic $p$-functions, where each $p$-shell comprises $3$ functions ($p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$, or equivalently, the linear combinations corresponding to $l=1, m=-1, 0, +1$). Therefore, each set of $p$-functions contributes $3$ basis functions. The total count of $p$-type basis functions on oxygen is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nTotal basis functions on the oxygen atom = ($3$ $s$-functions) + ($6$ $p$-functions) = $9$.\n\n**2. Hydrogen Atoms ($\\mathrm{H}$)**\n\nHydrogen is a first-row atom with atomic number $Z=1$ and electron configuration $1s^1$. It has no core electrons; its only orbital, the $1s$ orbital, is a valence orbital. For such atoms, the initial digit of the `X-YZG` notation is not applicable. The basis set for hydrogen is effectively `21G`.\n- The valence $1s$ orbital is split into two functions.\n    - An inner part, a contracted GTO constructed from $2$ primitive Gaussians. This provides one $s$-type basis function ($1s_{\\text{in}}'$).\n    - An outer part, a contracted GTO constructed from $1$ primitive Gaussian. This provides a second $s$-type basis function ($1s_{\\text{out}}'$).\n\nThe total number of basis functions on a single hydrogen atom is $1 + 1 = 2$. Both are $s$-type functions.\nSince the water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, their combined contribution to the basis set is $2 \\times 2 = 4$ $s$-type functions.\n\n**3.

This is remedied by adding polarization functions—orbitals with higher angular momentum than any occupied in the free atom. This final practice challenges you to derive from first principles why adding a set of $d$-functions ($l=2$) increases the basis by a different amount depending on whether spherical or Cartesian angular components are used, a crucial distinction in practical quantum chemistry.", "problem": "An oxygen atom is described by the split-valence Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) basis set 6-31G. A polarization-augmented variant 6-31G(d) adds a single shell of angular momentum $l=2$ ($d$-type) functions on oxygen. In the pure (spherical) convention, these $d$-type functions are built from spherical harmonics, whereas in the Cartesian convention they are built from homogeneous Cartesian polynomials of total degree $l$ multiplied by a common radial Gaussian factor. Using first principles, derive the increase in the number of basis functions on the oxygen atom upon going from 6-31G to 6-31G(d) under each convention.\n\nBegin from the following foundational bases:\n- The eigenfunctions of the total orbital angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}^{2}$ and its $z$-component $\\hat{L}_{z}$ form multiplets labeled by $l$ with magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l}$, and the associated spherical harmonics span the irreducible representations of the Special Orthogonal group in three dimensions (SO$(3)$).\n- Cartesian GTOs of angular momentum $l$ are formed by multiplying a common radial Gaussian factor by homogeneous Cartesian monomials $x^{i}y^{j}z^{k}$ with nonnegative integers $i,j,k$ such that $i+j+k=l$.\n\nFrom these definitions, determine the number of linearly independent functions in a single $d$-type shell ($l=2$) for each convention, and report the net increase in the number of basis functions on oxygen when moving from 6-31G to 6-31G(d) in the spherical and Cartesian conventions, respectively.

No rounding is necessary, and the answer is a unitless count.", "solution": "The problem statement is critically examined and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum chemistry, specifically the theory of atomic basis sets. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary definitions to derive a unique solution without ambiguity. The task is to determine the increase in the number of basis functions when augmenting a basis set for an oxygen atom from 6-31G to 6-31G(d). This increase corresponds precisely to the number of functions in the added $d$-type polarization shell, for which the angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$. We must derive this number for two distinct conventions: the pure (spherical) and the Cartesian conventions.\n\nFirst, we analyze the pure or spherical convention. The problem states that these functions are related to the spherical harmonics, $Y_{l}^{m_{l}}(\\theta, \\phi)$, which are the simultaneous eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum operator, $\\hat{L}^{2}$, and its projection onto the $z$-axis, $\\hat{L}_{z}$. The eigenvalues are given by $\\hat{L}^{2} Y_{l}^{m_{l}} = \\hbar^{2}l(l+1)Y_{l}^{m_{l}}$ and $\\hat{L}_{z} Y_{l}^{m_{l}} = \\hbar m_{l}Y_{l}^{m_{l}}$. For a fixed value of the angular momentum quantum number $l$, the magnetic quantum number $m_{l}$ can take on $2l+1$ integer values: $m_{l} \\in \\{-l, -l+1, \\dots, l-1, l\\}$. Each of these $2l+1$ values corresponds to a distinct, linearly independent eigenfunction. This set of $2l+1$ functions forms a basis for an irreducible representation of the special orthogonal group SO($3$), which is the group of rotations in three-dimensional space. For a $d$-type shell, we have $l=2$. The number of pure spherical harmonic functions, $N_{\\mathrm{sph}}$, is therefore given by:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{sph}} = 2l+1$$\nSubstituting $l=2$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{sph}} = 2(2)+1 = 5$$\nThus, there are $5$ linearly independent pure $d$-type functions, corresponding to $m_{l} = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. These are often denoted as $d_{z^2}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{xy}$, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the Cartesian convention. The problem states that Cartesian Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) are constructed from a product of a Gaussian radial part, $\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$, and a homogeneous Cartesian polynomial $x^{i}y^{j}z^{k}$, where $i, j, k$ are non-negative integers such that their sum equals the angular momentum quantum number, $l$. That is, $i+j+k=l$. For a $d$-type shell, we have $l=2$. The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of distinct combinations of non-negative integers $(i, j, k)$ that satisfy the equation:\n$$i+j+k=2$$\nThis is a standard problem in combinatorics, equivalent to distributing $n=2$ identical items (units of angular momentum) into $k_{vars}=3$ distinct bins (the Cartesian axes $x, y, z$). The number of ways to do this is given by the stars and bars formula:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{cart}} = \\binom{n+k_{vars}-1}{k_{vars}-1} = \\binom{n+k_{vars}-1}{n}$$\nSubstituting $n=l=2$ and $k_{vars}=3$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{cart}} = \\binom{2+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{4}{2}$$\nWe calculate the binomial coefficient:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{cart}} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$$\nAlternatively, one can enumerate the combinations explicitly:\n1. $(i,j,k)=(2,0,0) \\implies x^2$\n2. $(i,j,k)=(0,2,0) \\implies y^2$\n3. $(i,j,k)=(0,0,2) \\implies z^2$\n4. $(i,j,k)=(1,1,0) \\implies xy$\n5. $(i,j,k)=(1,0,1) \\implies xz$\n6. $(i,j,k)=(0,1,1) \\implies yz$\nThis confirms that there are $6$ Cartesian $d$-type functions.\n\nThe discrepancy between the two counts ($5$ versus $6$) arises because the set of $6$ Cartesian functions for $l=2$ forms a reducible representation of the rotation group SO($3$). It contains a linear combination of functions that transforms not as a $d$-type function ($l=2$), but as an $s$-type function ($l=0$). Specifically, the combination $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$ is spherically symmetric. When multiplied by the Gaussian radial part, the function $(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\exp(-\\alpha r^2) = r^2\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$ is a legitimate member of the Cartesian basis set but possesses the rotational symmetry of an $s$-orbital. This function is a linear contaminant. The remaining $5$ linear combinations can be constructed to be purely of $l=2$ character and are equivalent to the $5$ spherical harmonics. Therefore, the set of $6$ Cartesian functions contains one $s$-type contaminant and $5$ true $d$-type functions.\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in the number of basis functions, which is the number of functions in the added shell under each convention.\nFor the spherical (pure) convention, the increase is $N_{\\mathrm{sph}}=5$.\nFor the Cartesian convention, the increase is $N_{\\mathrm{cart}}=6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2905304"}]}
