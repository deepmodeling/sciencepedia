Single-point electronic energies (in hartree) are obtained at the same electronic-structure level for the complex and the isolated fragments, using both fragment-localized and dimer-augmented basis sets to probe basis set superposition error (BSSE).

The provided energy values are consistent with the variational principle, specifically that fragment energies are lowered when calculated in a larger basis set ($E_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{AB}} < E_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\mathrm{AB}} < E_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\mathrm{B}}$). Therefore, I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental objective is to determine the supramolecular interaction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$, which is defined as the energy change upon forming a complex $\\mathrm{AB}$ from its isolated, non-interacting fragments $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{int}} = E(\\text{complex}) - \\sum E(\\text{isolated fragments})$$\nThe calculation of this quantity is complicated by the use of finite, atom-centered basis sets in quantum chemistry, which gives rise to the basis set superposition error (BSSE). The protocol must address this artifact.\n\nFirst, we construct the uncorrected interaction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{uncorrected}}$. This is the most direct, yet most naive, application of the definition. In this approach, the energy of the complex, $E_{\\mathrm{AB}}$, calculated in the full dimer basis set (denoted by the superscript $\\mathrm{AB}$ on the composite system, which is implicit), is compared against the sum of the energies of isolated fragments, $E_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\mathrm{B}}$, where each fragment is calculated using only its own monomer-centered basis set.\nThe formula is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{uncorrected}} = E_{\\mathrm{AB}} - (E_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{A}} + E_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\mathrm{B}})$$\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed because the fragments $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are described with a smaller, less flexible basis set in isolation than they are within the supramolecular complex. Within the complex, fragment $\\mathrm{A}$ can \"borrow\" basis functions from fragment $\\mathrm{B}$ to lower its energy, and vice versa. This is an unphysical stabilization, an artifact of the incomplete basis, termed BSSE.\n\nTo rectify this, we construct the Boys–Bernardi counterpoise (CP) corrected interaction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{CP}}$. The protocol's logic is to evaluate the energies of all four species ($E_{\\mathrm{AB}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{B}}$, and the empty space for reference) within the *exact same* basis set—that of the full dimer. This is achieved by computing the energy of fragment $\\mathrm{A}$ in the presence of the basis functions of $\\mathrm{B}$ (termed \"ghost\" orbitals, with no nuclei or electrons), yielding $E_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{AB}}$, and similarly for fragment $\\mathrm{B}$ to obtain $E_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\mathrm{AB}}$. This ensures that the basis set is balanced for the complex and the fragments, thereby canceling the artificial stabilization from BSSE.\nThe CP-corrected formula is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{CP}} = E_{\\mathrm{AB}} - (E_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\mathrm{AB}} + E_{\\mathrm{B}}^{\\mathrm{AB}})$$\n\nThis protocol for determining a reliable interaction energy is the mandatory first step for any energy decomposition analysis (EDA) scheme. EDA methods partition the total interaction energy, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$, into physically distinct components such as electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, induction/polarization, and dispersion/charge-transfer. Using the uncorrected energy, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{uncorrected}}$, as the input for an EDA would be a grave error, as it conflates the genuine physical interactions with the BSSE artifact, leading to an overestimation of binding and a misinterpretation of its components. The counterpoise-corrected value, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{CP}}$, provides a much more physically sound estimate of the interaction energy by mitigating the basis set imbalance. It must be noted, however, that even $E_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\text{CP}}$ is a model-dependent quantity whose accuracy is limited by the chosen level of theory and basis set, and the correction scheme itself is not perfect. The fixed-geometry constraint also neglects the energy required to deform the monomers into their in-complex geometries.\n\nWe now apply this protocol to the given data.
