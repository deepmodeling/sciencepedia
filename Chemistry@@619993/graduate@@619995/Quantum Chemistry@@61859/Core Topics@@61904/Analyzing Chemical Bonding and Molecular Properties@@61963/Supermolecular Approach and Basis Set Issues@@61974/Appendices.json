We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the interaction energy, $\\Delta E_{\\text{int}}$, for a dimer $AB$ composed of monomers $A$ and $B$. The supermolecular approach is specified, wherein the interaction energy is defined as the difference between the total electronic energy of the dimer (the \"supermolecule\") and the sum of the electronic energies of the individual, non-interacting monomers.\n\nThe calculation is performed at the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) level within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. The geometries of the monomers are held fixed at their configuration within the dimer. The energy of the dimer system, where monomers $A$ and $B$ are at a finite separation, is given as $E_{AB}$.

A negative value for $\\Delta E_{\\text{int}}$ signifies that the energy of the dimer, $E_{AB}$, is lower than the sum of the energies of the constituent monomers when they are infinitely far apart. This indicates a net attractive interaction between monomers $A$ and $B$, leading to the formation of a stable, bound complex at the given geometry.\n\nSecond, the problem states that basis set superposition error (BSSE) is neglected. In a finite, atom-centered basis set calculation, this is a critical point. When calculating the energy of the dimer $E_{AB}$, the basis functions of monomer $A$ can be used to describe the electron density of monomer $B$, and vice versa. This \"borrowing\" of basis functions effectively provides a larger, more flexible basis set for each monomer within the dimer complex than was available for the isolated monomer calculations of $E_A$ and $E_B$. According to the variational principle, a larger basis set leads to a lower (more negative) calculated energy. Consequently, the energy $E_{AB}$ is artificially lowered. This artificial stabilization is the basis set superposition error. Since the interaction energy is calculated as $E_{AB} - (E_A + E_B)$, the artificially low $E_{AB}$ results in a spuriously negative, or \"over-binding,\" interaction energy. Therefore, neglecting BSSE typically leads to an overestimation of the magnitude of the binding energy. The correct procedure would involve the counterpoise correction method of Boys and Bernardi, where monomer energies are calculated using the full dimer basis set (including \"ghost\" functions), but this was explicitly excluded.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-28.24}$$", "id": "2927905"}, {"introduction": "While straightforward, the uncorrected supermolecular approach is susceptible to Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE), which can artificially overestimate binding strength.

This error arises artificial stabilization because each monomer in the dimer calculation can \"borrow\" basis functions from its partner, effectively expanding its own basis set.

It addresses a standard topic in computational quantum chemistry—Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE)—using realistic data for a canonical system, $n$-butane. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to identify the diagnostic signature of intramolecular BSSE from the provided data and to quantify its contribution to the relative energy of the gauche and trans conformers of $n$-butane at the small basis set level. A first-principles approach is required.\n\nLet us begin with the fundamental definitions. The total electronic energy of a molecular conformer at a given geometry (defined by the dihedral angle $\\phi$) calculated with an incomplete basis set is denoted as $E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(\\phi)$. This energy is afflicted by BSSE, an error arising from the artificial stabilization of spatially close molecular fragments that \"borrow\" basis functions from each other. The magnitude of this artificial stabilization for a given conformer is $\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi)$, which is a positive quantity, $\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi) \\geq 0$. This error is most pronounced for smaller, less flexible basis sets and for geometries where non-bonded fragments are in close proximity.\n\nThe Boys–Bernardi counterpoise (CP) correction is a method to estimate and remove this error. The CP-corrected total energy, $E_{\\text{total, CP}}(\\phi)$, is defined as the sum of the uncorrected energy and the BSSE magnitude for that conformer:\n$$E_{\\text{total, CP}}(\\phi) = E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(\\phi) + \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi)$$\nThe problem provides relative energies, $E_{\\text{rel}}(\\phi)$, where the energy of the anti (trans) conformer at $\\phi = 180^{\\circ}$ is set to zero for each method. The uncorrected relative energy is:\n$$E_{\\text{rel, uncorr}}(\\phi) = E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(\\phi) - E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(180^{\\circ})$$\nSimilarly, the CP-corrected relative energy is:\n$$E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(\\phi) = E_{\\text{total, CP}}(\\phi) - E_{\\text{total, CP}}(180^{\\circ})$$\nBy substituting the definition of the CP-corrected total energy into the expression for the relative CP-corrected energy, we can establish the relationship between the reported uncorrected and corrected relative energies:\n$$E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(\\phi) = [E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(\\phi) + \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi)] - [E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(180^{\\circ}) + \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(180^{\\circ})]$$\nRearranging terms gives:\n$$E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(\\phi) = [E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(\\phi) - E_{\\text{total, uncorr}}(180^{\\circ})] + [\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi) - \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(180^{\\circ})]$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(\\phi) = E_{\\text{rel, uncorr}}(\\phi) + \\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi)$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi) = \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(\\phi) - \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(180^{\\circ})$ represents the BSSE contribution to the relative energy of the conformer at angle $\\phi$ with respect to the trans reference conformer. This is precisely the quantity the problem asks us to estimate for the gauche conformer ($\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$).\n\nNow, we identify the pattern in the data that diagnoses intramolecular BSSE.\n$1$. The most striking indicator of severe BSSE is the physically incorrect result obtained with the small basis set without correction. The data shows $E_{\\text{rel, uncorr}}(60^{\\circ}) = -0.6 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. This incorrectly predicts the gauche conformer to be more stable than the trans conformer, which contradicts established experimental and high-level theoretical results. This unphysical stabilization is a direct consequence of BSSE, which is significantly larger for the sterically crowded gauche conformer than for the extended trans conformer, i.e., $\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(60^{\\circ}) > \\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(180^{\\circ})$.\n$2$. The application of the CP correction rectifies this physical inconsistency. For the small basis, the corrected relative energy is $E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(60^{\\circ}) = 3.4 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, correctly showing the trans conformer as the global minimum. This demonstrates that the CP correction removes the source of the artificial stabilization.\n$3$. BSSE is a deficiency of the basis set. A larger, more complete basis set should exhibit a smaller BSSE. The data confirms this. The difference between the uncorrected and CP-corrected results for the gauche-trans energy difference is a measure of the relative BSSE.\nFor the small basis: $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(60^{\\circ}) = 3.4 - (-0.6) = 4.00 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\nFor the large basis: $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(60^{\\circ}) = 3.2 - 2.9 = 0.3 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\nThe BSSE contribution is more than an order of magnitude smaller for the large basis set than for the small one. This strong dependence of the correction's magnitude on the basis set size is the definitive diagnostic pattern for BSSE.\n\nWe are asked to estimate the magnitude of the intramolecular BSSE contribution to the gauche–trans relative energy at the small basis level. This quantity is $\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(60^{\\circ})$. From our derivation, it is given by the difference between the CP-corrected and uncorrected relative energies of the gauche conformer:\n$$\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(60^{\\circ}) = E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(60^{\\circ}) - E_{\\text{rel, uncorr}}(60^{\\circ})$$\nUsing the provided data for the small basis set:\n$E_{\\text{rel, uncorr}}(60^{\\circ}) = -0.6 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$E_{\\text{rel, CP}}(60^{\\circ}) = 3.4 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\Delta\\delta_{\\text{BSSE}}(60^{\\circ}) = 3.4 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} - (-0.6 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}) = 4.00 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00}$$", "id": "2927918"}]}
