This exercise guides you through the foundational derivation of the second-order perturbation theory expression for this stabilization energy, a formula you will use constantly in NBO studies. You will then apply this formula to quantify the energetic importance of hyperconjugation in the ethyl cation, a classic textbook example [@problem_id:2459166].", "problem": "You are asked to formalize, from first principles, how Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) deletion analysis quantifies the energetic effect of removing hyperconjugative interactions, and to implement the resulting expression in a program. In Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis, a hyperconjugative stabilization arises from donor–acceptor mixing between an occupied donor natural bond orbital and a formally unoccupied acceptor natural bond orbital. In a deletion analysis (the NBO `DELETE` keyword), a specified set of donor–acceptor couplings is removed, and the energetic penalty of this removal is equal to the stabilization that those couplings had provided. Starting from the Hartree–Fock picture and standard time-independent, non-degenerate second-order perturbation theory, derive the leading-order expression for the stabilization energy due to the interaction between one occupied donor and one empty acceptor in terms of the donor occupancy, the off-diagonal Fock matrix element, and the orbital energy gap. Generalize this to a sum over multiple donor–acceptor interactions that model the hyperconjugation in the ethyl cation.

It presents a standard task in computational chemistry: the derivation and application of the second-order perturbation theory expression for hyperconjugative stabilization energy within the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) framework. All necessary data and constraints are provided, and the problem is free of logical or factual contradictions. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to formalize the stabilization energy, $\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j}$, that arises from the interaction between an occupied donor NBO, denoted by the wavefunction $|\\phi_i\\rangle$, and an empty acceptor NBO, $|\\phi_j\\rangle$. We work within the Hartree-Fock approximation, where the effective one-electron Hamiltonian is the Fock operator, $\\hat{F}$.\n\nIn the NBO basis, which is assumed to be orthonormal, the Fock matrix is not diagonal. The diagonal elements, $F_{kk} = \\langle \\phi_k | \\hat{F} | \\phi_k \\rangle$, are the NBO orbital energies, which we denote as $\\epsilon_k$. The off-diagonal elements, $F_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{F} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ for $i \\neq j$, represent the coupling or interaction between different NBOs. These off-diagonal elements are precisely what give rise to delocalization effects such as hyperconjugation.\n\nTo quantify the energetic effect of these interactions, we employ time-independent, non-degenerate perturbation theory. We partition the Fock operator $\\hat{F}$ into two parts: an unperturbed Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}^{(0)}$ and a perturbation $\\hat{V}$.\n\nThe unperturbed system, $\\hat{H}^{(0)}$, is defined as the diagonal part of the Fock operator in the NBO basis. Its eigenfunctions are the NBOs themselves, $|\\phi_k\\rangle$, with corresponding eigenvalues being the NBO energies, $\\epsilon_k$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}^{(0)} |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle\n$$\nThe perturbation, $\\hat{V}$, comprises all off-diagonal elements of the Fock operator. We are concerned with the specific interaction between donor $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ and acceptor $|\\phi_j\\rangle$, so the perturbation of interest involves the matrix element $F_{ij}$.\n\nAccording to standard second-order perturbation theory, the energy of the state $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ is lowered due to its interaction with another state $|\\phi_j\\rangle$. The second-order correction to the energy, $E_i^{(2)}$, is given by:\n$$\nE_i^{(2)} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{|\\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{V} | \\phi_j \\rangle|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j}\n$$\nIn our specific donor-acceptor case, the perturbation matrix element $\\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{V} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ is simply the off-diagonal Fock matrix element $F_{ij}$. The energy correction for the interaction between a single donor $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ and a single acceptor $|\\phi_j\\rangle$ is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta E_i^{(2)} = \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j}\n$$\nThis expression represents the energy change for a single electron. The donor NBO $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ is occupied by $n_i$ electrons. Therefore, the total stabilization energy resulting from the delocalization of these $n_i$ electrons into the acceptor orbital $|\\phi_j\\rangle$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j} = n_i \\times \\Delta E_i^{(2)} = n_i \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the donor energy $\\epsilon_i$ is lower than the acceptor energy $\\epsilon_j$, so the denominator $\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j$ is negative. This makes $\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j}$ a negative quantity, correctly representing a stabilization of the system's total energy.\n\nThe NBO deletion analysis computes the energetic *penalty* associated with removing this interaction. This penalty is defined as the positive magnitude of the stabilization energy. Let us denote this quantity by $E^{(2)}_{i \\rightarrow j}$:\n$$\nE^{(2)}_{i \\rightarrow j} = |\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j}| = \\left| n_i \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j} \\right| = n_i \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_i}\n$$\nSince $F_{ij}$ is given as a real number, $|F_{ij}|^2$ simplifies to $F_{ij}^2$. The final expression for the destabilization energy upon deleting a single donor-acceptor interaction is:\n$$\nE^{(2)}_{i \\rightarrow j} = n_i \\frac{F_{ij}^2}{\\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_i}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental expression used in NBO analysis to estimate the strength of hyperconjugative and other delocalization effects. The problem requires this to be generalized for the case of multiple donors, indexed by $k$, interacting with a single acceptor $j$. Assuming the contributions are additive, which is valid under the small-perturbation approximation, the total destabilization energy, $E_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{k} E^{(2)}_{i_k \\rightarrow j} = \\sum_{k} n_{i_k} \\frac{F_{i_k j}^2}{\\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_{i_k}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression to be implemented.

According to the definition provided, the NO occupation numbers are the eigenvalues of the one-particle reduced density matrix ($1$-RDM), $P$, and the NOs are its eigenvectors.\n\nFirst, we must find the eigenvalues of the matrix $P$.

In a simple, uncorrelated picture of a closed-shell two-electron system (i.e., the Hartree-Fock approximation), one molecular orbital would be doubly occupied and all others would be empty. For this two-orbital system, this would correspond to occupation numbers of $n_1 = 2$ and $n_2 = 0$.\nThe calculated occupation numbers are $n_1 \\approx 1.63$ and $n_2 \\approx 0.37$. The deviation from integer values ($2$ and $0$) is a direct manifestation of **electron correlation**. The true wavefunction of the system is not a single Slater determinant but a superposition of multiple determinants.\n\nIn the language of NBO analysis, this phenomenon is described as a **donor-acceptor interaction** or **delocalization**.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The natural orbital with the high occupation number, $n_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{0.4}$, is identified as a Lewis-type orbital. It is the \"donor\" orbital, analogous to a bonding orbital in a simple Lewis structure picture. Its occupation is less than the idealized value of $2$.\n    \\item The natural orbital with the low occupation number, $n_2 = 1 - \\sqrt{0.4}$, is a non-Lewis-type orbital. It is the \"acceptor\" orbital, analogous to an antibonding orbital. Its occupation is greater than the idealized value of $0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe fractional occupations indicate that there is a partial transfer of electron density from the occupied donor orbital ($v_1$) to the formally vacant acceptor orbital ($v_2$). This delocalization corresponds to a mixing of the ground-state electronic configuration (where $v_1$ is doubly occupied) with a doubly-excited configuration (where $v_2$ is doubly occupied). This mixing, driven by the off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian in the basis of these configurations, lowers the total energy relative to the single-determinant description.
