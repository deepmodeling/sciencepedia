The ground state consists of two electrons occupying the bonding molecular orbital $\\psi_1$.\nThe coefficients for this occupied MO are $c_1=c_2=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe self-consistent bond order $P_{12}$ is then calculated:\n$$\nP_{12} = 2 \\sum_{\\text{occ.}} c_{1}\\,c_{2} = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 1\n$$\nThis confirms the self-consistency of the solution: starting with $n_1=n_2=1$ leads to MO coefficients that produce $P_{12}=1$ and $n_1=P_{11}=2c_1^2=1$, $n_2=P_{22}=2c_2^2=1$. The self-consistent site populations are $n_1=1$, $n_2=1$, and the C-C bond order is $P_{12}=1$.\n\nNext, we compute the ground-state energies.\n\n**PPP Ground-State Energy:**\nThe total $\\pi$-electron energy in the PPP model is the sum of the electronic energy and the core-core repulsion energy, $E_{PPP} = E_{\\pi} + E_{\\text{core-core}}$.

The Hamiltonian matrix is simply:\n$$\nH^{HMO} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_{\\pm} = \\alpha \\pm \\beta$. The ground state has two electrons in the bonding orbital with energy $\\epsilon_{+} = \\alpha + \\beta$. The total HMO energy is:\n$$\nE_{HMO} = 2(\\alpha + \\beta) = 2(0 - 2.50\\,\\text{eV}) = -5.00\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nThe MO coefficients are the same as in the PPP case for this molecule, $c_1=c_2=1/\\sqrt{2}$. The bond order and populations are therefore identical: $P_{12}=1$ and $n_1=n_2=1$.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Populations and Bond Order:** Both PPP and HMO methods predict identical site populations ($n_i=1$) and bond order ($P_{12}=1$). This occurs because the high symmetry of ethylene ($D_{2h}$) constrains the MO coefficients to be $(1/\\sqrt{2}, \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2})$. For neutral alternant hydrocarbons, the uniform charge distribution ($n_i=z_i=1$) is a rigorous result in HMO theory and is preserved in the self-consistent PPP calculation.\n- **$\\pi$-Electron Energy:** The energies differ significantly: $E_{PPP} = -3.343\\,\\text{eV}$ and $E_{HMO} = -5.00\\,\\text{eV}$. The difference is $E_{PPP} - E_{HMO} = (2\\alpha+2\\beta + \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma_{11} - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma_{12}) - (2\\alpha+2\\beta) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{11} - \\gamma_{12})$. Numerically, this is $\\frac{1}{2}(11.00 - 7.686) = 1.657\\,\\text{eV}$. The PPP energy is higher (less stable) because it explicitly includes the repulsive energy between the two $\\pi$-electrons. The HMO method entirely neglects this repulsion, resulting in an artificially low energy. The term $\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{11} - \\gamma_{12})$ represents the net repulsion of the two electrons in the delocalized bonding orbital, averaged over their motion.\n\nThe problem asks for the PPP C-C bond order $P_{12}$ as the final answer.

The calculated bond order of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is identical to the value obtained from simple HMO theory for benzene. This is not a coincidence. Although the problem is posed in the context of the more sophisticated Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) method, which explicitly treats electron-electron repulsion, the crucial simplification is the provision of the final MO coefficients. For a highly symmetric molecule like benzene ($D_{6h}$ point group), the form of the MOs is dictated by symmetry alone. The provided SALCs are precisely the real-valued form of the eigenvectors that diagonalize any Hamiltonian with the given symmetry, including both the Hückel and the self-consistent PPP-Fock Hamiltonians. As the bond order calculation depends only on the occupied MO coefficients, and these are determined by symmetry, the result is independent of the specifics of the underlying Hamiltonian model (Hückel vs. PPP).

For carbon-nitrogen bonds in pyridine, use $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CN}}$ as specified per case.\n\nSelf-consistent field (SCF):\n- Perform an RHF self-consistent procedure using the $F$-matrix defined above, with the initial guess $P^{(0)} = \\mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,1,1,1)$, and simple linear mixing $P^{(n+1)} \\leftarrow \\lambda P_{\\mathrm{new}}^{(n+1)} + (1-\\lambda) P^{(n)}$ with a constant mixing parameter $0 < \\lambda < 1$.\n- Convergence criterion: use the root-mean-square (RMS) norm of the density change,\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i,j} \\left(P^{(n+1)}_{ij} - P^{(n)}_{ij}\\right)^2},\n$$\nand stop when $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{RMS}} < 10^{-10}$. If convergence is not reached in $500$ iterations, stop and use the last iterate.\n\nAngle units are in radians. Energies must be handled in electronvolts (eV), and distances in Angstroms ($\\mathrm{\\AA}$). The output charges are dimensionless.\n\nTest suite:\nRun the following three cases, each on the six-site ring. The heteroatom (if present) is at site $0$, and all other sites are carbon. Report the $\\pi$ atomic charges $q_i$ for $i=0,1,2,3,4,5$ in this order for each case.\n\n- Case 1 (benzene reference): all sites carbon, so use $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$, and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CC}}$ for every nearest-neighbor pair.\n- Case 2 (pyridine): site $0$ is nitrogen with $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{N}} = -2.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$, $U_{\\mathrm{N}} = 12.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$; carbon-nitrogen nearest-neighbor bonds use $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CN}} = -2.20 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$; all other nearest-neighbor bonds use $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CC}}$; all remaining sites are carbon with standard carbon parameters.\n- Case 3 (edge variation): same as Case 2 except use $U_{\\mathrm{N}} = 14.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CN}} = -1.80 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of three inner lists, each inner list containing the six site charges for one case in order $[q_0,q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4,q_5]$. There must be no spaces anywhere in the output. Each charge must be rounded to six digits after the decimal point.\n- For example, the output format must be like: [[q00,q01,q02,q03,q04,q05],[q10,q11,q12,q13,q14,q15],[q20,q21,q22,q23,q24,q25]] where $qab$ denotes the $b$-th site of case $a$.", "solution": "The problem statement requires the construction of a self-consistent field program to solve the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model for benzene and pyridine. This task represents a direct application of the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) method within the Zero Differential Overlap (ZDO) approximation. The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and constitutes a standard exercise in computational quantum chemistry. The solution proceeds by algorithmically implementing the specified self-consistent field (SCF) procedure.\n\nFirst, we establish the molecular framework. The system consists of $N=6$ atomic sites arranged in a regular hexagon in the $xy$-plane with side length $s=1.40 \\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$. The position of site $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 5\\}$ is given by Cartesian coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i = r \\cos \\theta_i$ and $y_i = r \\sin \\theta_i$, with circumradius $r=s$ and angle $\\theta_i = \\frac{2\\pi i}{N}$. The Euclidean distance matrix $R$ with elements $R_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}$ is computed from these coordinates.\n\nThe electronic Hamiltonian is constructed in a basis of one $p_z$ atomic orbital per site. The one-electron part of the Hamiltonian, the core Hamiltonian $h$, has matrix elements $h_{ij} = \\alpha_i \\delta_{ij} + \\beta_{ij}$. The diagonal elements $\\alpha_i$ are the site energies, which depend on the atom type (carbon or nitrogen). The off-diagonal elements $\\beta_{ij}$ are the resonance integrals, non-zero only for nearest-neighbor sites.\n\nThe two-electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) are simplified under the ZDO approximation. Only Coulomb-type integrals $\\gamma_{ij} \\equiv (ii|jj)$ are retained. The on-site integral is $\\gamma_{ii} = U_i$. The inter-site integrals for $i \\neq j$ are calculated using the Ohno interpolation formula:\n$$\n\\gamma_{ij} = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{R_{ij}^2 + \\left(\\frac{K}{U_{ij}^{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right)^2}}\n$$\nwhere $K = 14.397 \\ \\mathrm{eV \\cdot \\AA}$ is a conversion factor and $U_{ij}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = (U_i + U_j)/2$ is the effective on-site repulsion. These integrals are computed once and stored in a matrix $\\gamma$, as they are independent of the electronic density.\n\nThe core of the calculation is the SCF procedure to solve the Roothaan-Hall equations, $FC = EC$, for a closed-shell system. The Fock matrix $F$ depends on the density matrix $P$. The process is iterative:\n$1$. An initial guess for the density matrix is made. The problem specifies $P^{(0)} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$, which corresponds to one $\\pi$ electron localized on each site, resulting in initially neutral atoms.\n$2$. In each iteration $n$, the Fock matrix $F^{(n)}$ is constructed using the current density matrix $P^{(n-1)}$:\n$$\nF_{ii} = h_{ii} + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\gamma_{ik} (P_{kk}^{(n-1)} - z_k)\n$$\n$$\nF_{ij} = h_{ij} - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_{ij} P_{ij}^{(n-1)} \\quad (i \\neq j)\n$$\nHere, $z_k=1$ is the core charge of site $k$.\n$3$. The secular equation $F^{(n)} C^{(n)} = E^{(n)} C^{(n)}$ is solved by diagonalizing $F^{(n)}$. This yields molecular orbital (MO) energies $E_m$ (eigenvalues) and MO coefficient vectors $C_m$ (eigenvectors).\n$4$. A new density matrix, $P_{\\mathrm{new}}^{(n)}$, is constructed from the coefficients of the $N_{\\mathrm{occ}} = N/2 = 3$ lowest-energy (occupied) MOs:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{new}, ij}^{(n)} = 2 \\sum_{m=0}^{N_{\\mathrm{occ}}-1} C_{im}^{(n)} C_{jm}^{(n)}\n$$\n$5$. To aid convergence, the density matrix for the next iteration is formed by linear mixing of the old and new matrices: $P^{(n)} = \\lambda P_{\\mathrm{new}}^{(n)} + (1-\\lambda) P^{(n-1)}$. A mixing parameter $\\lambda$ is specified to be in the range $(0,1)$; a standard choice of $\\lambda=0.5$ is used for stable convergence.\n$6$. The procedure is repeated until the change in the density matrix between successive iterations is below a threshold, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i,j} (P^{(n)}_{ij} - P^{(n-1)}_{ij})^2} < 10^{-10}$.\n\nOnce the SCF procedure has converged, the final density matrix $P$ is used to compute the $\\pi$ atomic charges. The electron population on site $i$ is $n_i = P_{ii}$. The net charge is the difference between the core charge and this population: $q_i = z_i - n_i = 1 - P_{ii}$.\n\nThe three specified test cases are implemented by defining the appropriate parameter sets:\n- **Case 1 (Benzene):** All $6$ sites are carbon atoms. $\\alpha_i = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $U_i = U_{\\mathrm{C}} = 11.26 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ for all $i$. All nearest-neighbor resonance integrals are $\\beta = \\beta_{\\mathrm{CC}} = -2.50 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- **Case 2 (Pyridine):** Site $i=0$ is a nitrogen atom, and sites $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$ are carbon atoms. The parameters are: $\\alpha_0 = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{N}} = -2.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $U_0 = U_{\\mathrm{N}} = 12.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$. The carbon sites use $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{C}}$ and $U_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The C-N bonds, $(0,1)$ and $(0,5)$, have $\\beta = \\beta_{\\mathrm{CN}} = -2.20 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$, while other C-C bonds use $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CC}}$.\n- **Case 3 (Pyridine variant):** The setup is the same as Case $2$, but with modified nitrogen and C-N bond parameters: $U_0 = U_{\\mathrm{N}} = 14.00 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CN}} = -1.80 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe program encapsulates this entire logic into a function that is called for each case. The resulting charge vectors are then formatted into the required single-line output string.", "answer": "[[0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000],[-0.201777,0.093122,0.010168,0.052072,0.010168,0.093122],[-0.170668,0.076840,0.012170,0.040149,0.012170,0.076840]]", "id": "2913454"}]}
