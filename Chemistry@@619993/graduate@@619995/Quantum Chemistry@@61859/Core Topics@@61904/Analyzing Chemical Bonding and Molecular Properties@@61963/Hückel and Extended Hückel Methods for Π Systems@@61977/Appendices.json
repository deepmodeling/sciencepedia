The ground state electron configuration has two electrons in the lowest level ($\\alpha+2\\beta$) and two electrons to place in the two degenerate highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs). This situation, a degenerate partially-filled level, is unstable with respect to a geometric distortion that lifts the degeneracy. This is the Jahn-Teller effect.\n\nFor $\\delta \\neq 0$, the degeneracy is lifted. The levels at $\\alpha$ split into $\\alpha+2\\beta\\delta$ and $\\alpha-2\\beta\\delta$. To find the total energy, we must occupy the two lowest-energy orbitals with two electrons each.\nThe lowest energy level is unambiguously $E_I = \\alpha+2\\beta$ (since $\\beta$ is negative).\nThe second lowest level, $E_{II}$, depends on the sign of $\\delta$:\n- If $\\delta > 0$, then $2\\beta\\delta$ is negative and $-2\\beta\\delta$ is positive. The ordered pair from the split levels is $\\alpha+2\\beta\\delta < \\alpha-2\\beta\\delta$. Thus, $E_{II} = \\alpha+2\\beta\\delta$.\n- If $\\delta < 0$, then $2\\beta\\delta$ is positive and $-2\\beta\\delta$ is negative. The ordered pair is $\\alpha-2\\beta\\delta < \\alpha+2\\beta\\delta$. Thus, $E_{II} = \\alpha-2\\beta\\delta$.\n\nThe total $\\pi$-electron energy, $E_{\\pi}$, is the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals: $E_{\\pi} = 2E_I + 2E_{II}$.\n- For $\\delta > 0$: $E_{\\pi} = 2(\\alpha+2\\beta) + 2(\\alpha+2\\beta\\delta) = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta\\delta$.\n- For $\\delta < 0$: $E_{\\pi} = 2(\\alpha+2\\beta) + 2(\\alpha-2\\beta\\delta) = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta - 4\\beta\\delta$.\n\nThese two cases can be combined into a single expression using the absolute value function, $|\\delta|$:\nFor $\\delta > 0$, $|\\delta|=\\delta$. For $\\delta < 0$, $|\\delta|=-\\delta$. So in both scenarios, the stabilization term is positive, while $\\beta$ is negative. Let's rewrite the expressions in terms of $|\\delta|$.\n- For $\\delta > 0$, $E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta|\\delta|$.\n- For $\\delta < 0$, $E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta(-\\delta) = 4\\alpha+4\\beta+4\\beta|\\delta|$.\nThus, a single expression valid for any $\\delta$ is:\n$$ E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta + 4\\beta|\\delta| $$\nThis can be simplified by factoring:\n$$ E_{\\pi} = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta(1+|\\delta|) $$\nThe energy of the undistorted molecule ($\\delta=0$) is $E_{\\pi}(0) = 4\\alpha+4\\beta$. The change in energy upon distortion is $\\Delta E_{\\pi} = E_{\\pi}(\\delta) - E_{\\pi}(0) = 4\\beta|\\delta|$. Since $\\beta<0$ and $|\\delta|\\ge 0$, the distortion always leads to a stabilization ($\\Delta E_{\\pi} \\le 0$), as predicted by the Jahn-Teller theorem.\nThe effective resonance integrals are modified by the distortion. When $\\delta>0$, the shorter bonds have a more negative resonance integral $\\beta(1+\\delta)$, while the longer bonds have a less negative one, $\\beta(1-\\delta)$.

Solving a $2\\times 2$ generalized eigenvalue problem is computationally trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is a valid problem. I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe foundation of band structure calculations in a periodic crystal using an LCAO basis is Bloch's theorem. For a one-dimensional lattice with lattice constant $a$ (here taken as $a=1$), the basis functions are not the atomic orbitals ($\\phi$) themselves, but Bloch sums constructed from them. For an orbital of type $\\mu$ (where $\\mu = A$ or $B$) located in unit cell $n$ at position $R_n$, the corresponding Bloch sum is:\n$$\n\\Psi_\\mu(k) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{\\mathrm{i} k R_n} \\phi_\\mu(\\vec{r} - R_n)\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of unit cells in the crystal and $k$ is the crystal momentum. The total electronic wavefunction for a given $k$ is a linear combination of these basis functions:\n$$\n\\psi(k) = c_A(k) \\Psi_A(k) + c_B(k) \\Psi_B(k)\n$$\nThe energy expectation value of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ for this state is given by the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\nE(k) = \\frac{\\langle \\psi(k) | \\hat{H} | \\psi(k) \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi(k) | \\psi(k) \\rangle} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\mu,\\nu} c_\\mu^*(k) c_\\nu(k) H_{\\mu\\nu}(k)}{\\sum_{\\mu,\\nu} c_\\mu^*(k) c_\\nu(k) S_{\\mu\\nu}(k)}\n$$\nwhere $H_{\\mu\\nu}(k) = \\langle \\Psi_\\mu(k) | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_\\nu(k) \\rangle$ are the Hamiltonian matrix elements and $S_{\\mu\\nu}(k) = \\langle \\Psi_\\mu(k) | \\Psi_\\nu(k) \\rangle$ are the overlap matrix elements in the Bloch basis.\n\nThe variational principle requires minimizing $E(k)$ with respect to the coefficients $c_\\mu^*(k)$. This procedure, $\\frac{\\partial E(k)}{\\partial c_\\mu^*(k)} = 0$, leads to the secular equations, which can be written in matrix form as the generalized eigenvalue problem stated in the problem:\n$$\nH(k) \\, c(k) = E(k) \\, S(k) \\, c(k)\n$$\nwhere $c(k)$ is the column vector of coefficients $(c_A(k), c_B(k))^T$. Our task is to determine the explicit forms of the $2 \\times 2$ matrices $H(k)$ and $S(k)$.\n\nThe matrix elements are calculated by substituting the definitions of the Bloch sums. For the overlap matrix:\n$$\nS_{\\mu\\nu}(k) = \\langle \\Psi_\\mu(k) | \\Psi_\\nu(k) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n,m} e^{\\mathrm{i} k (R_m-R_n)} \\langle \\phi_\\mu(\\vec{r}-R_n) | \\phi_\\nu(\\vec{r}-R_m) \\rangle\n$$\nDue to translational symmetry, the integral $\\langle \\phi_\\mu(\\vec{r}-R_n) | \\phi_\\nu(\\vec{r}-R_m) \\rangle$ depends only on the difference in cell indices, $l = m-n$. Setting $R_n=n$, we can write this integral as $S_{\\mu\\nu, l} = \\langle \\phi_\\mu(\\vec{r}) | \\phi_\\nu(\\vec{r}-R_l) \\rangle$. The sum over $n$ and $m$ simplifies to a single sum over $l$:\n$$\nS_{\\mu\\nu}(k) = \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\mathrm{i} k l} S_{\\mu\\nu, l}\n$$\n- For the diagonal elements $S_{AA}(k)$, the problem specifies neglecting inter-site overlaps for like orbitals, so $S_{AA,l} = \\langle \\phi_A | \\phi_A(\\vec{r}-R_l) \\rangle = \\delta_{l0}$. Thus, $S_{AA}(k) = \\sum_l e^{\\mathrm{i} k l} \\delta_{l0} = 1$. Similarly, $S_{BB}(k) = 1$.\n- For the off-diagonal element $S_{AB}(k)$, the model includes nearest-neighbor interactions. The problem statement implies that from an orbital $A$ in cell $n$, we have an intra-cell overlap with orbital $B$ in cell $n$ ($l=0$, $S_{AB,0} = s_0$) and an inter-cell overlap with orbital $B$ in cell $n-1$ ($l=-1$, $S_{AB,-1} = s_1$). All other overlaps are zero.\nTherefore, $S_{AB}(k) = e^{\\mathrm{i} k (0)} s_0 + e^{\\mathrm{i} k (-1)} s_1 = s_0 + s_1 e^{-\\mathrm{i} k}$.\n- The element $S_{BA}(k)$ is the Hermitian conjugate of $S_{AB}(k)$: $S_{BA}(k) = S_{AB}(k)^* = (s_0 + s_1 e^{-\\mathrm{i} k})^* = s_0 + s_1 e^{\\mathrm{i} k}$, assuming $s_0$ and $s_1$ are real.\n\nThese derivations confirm the structure provided. The overlap matrix is:\n$$\nS(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s_0 + s_1 e^{-\\mathrm{i}k} \\\\ s_0 + s_1 e^{\\mathrm{i}k} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian matrix elements $H_{\\mu\\nu}(k)$ are derived similarly.\n- For diagonal elements $H_{AA}(k)$, the on-site energy is $\\langle \\phi_A | \\hat{H} | \\phi_A \\rangle = \\alpha_A$. Neglecting inter-site Hamiltonian matrix elements between like orbitals leads to $H_{AA}(k) = \\alpha_A$. Similarly, $H_{BB}(k) = \\alpha_B$.\n- For off-diagonal elements $H_{AB}(k)$, we use the Wolfsberg–Helmholtz approximation, which relates the Hamiltonian matrix elements to the overlap matrix elements *in the Bloch basis*:\n$$\nH_{AB}(k) = K \\, S_{AB}(k) \\, \\frac{\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B}{2} = K \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B}{2} \\right) (s_0 + s_1 e^{-\\mathrm{i}k})\n$$\nAnd its conjugate: $H_{BA}(k) = H_{AB}(k)^* = K \\left( \\frac{\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B}{2} \\right) (s_0 + s_1 e^{\\mathrm{i}k})$.\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$\nH(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_A & K \\frac{\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B}{2} (s_0 + s_1 e^{-\\mathrm{i}k}) \\\\ K \\frac{\\alpha_A + \\alpha_B}{2} (s_0 + s_1 e^{\\mathrm{i}k}) & \\alpha_B \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWith the matrices $H(k)$ and $S(k)$ fully specified, the final step is to solve the $2 \\times 2$ generalized eigenvalue problem for the parameters given in each test case. This is a standard numerical task. For each specified value of $k$, the complex-valued Hermitian matrices are constructed and then passed to a generalized eigensolver, such as `scipy.linalg.eigh` in Python. This function returns the two real-valued energy eigenvalues, which are then sorted in ascending order as required.
