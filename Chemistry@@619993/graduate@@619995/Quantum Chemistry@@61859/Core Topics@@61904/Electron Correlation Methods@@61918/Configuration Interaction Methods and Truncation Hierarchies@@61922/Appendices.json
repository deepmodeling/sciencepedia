It is a fundamental combinatorial problem within the framework of configuration interaction theory in quantum chemistry. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental premise of this problem rests on the nature of a Slater determinant. For a system of $N$ electrons, a Slater determinant is constructed from a set of $N$ spin-orbitals, $\\{\\chi_{p_1}, \\chi_{p_2}, ..., \\chi_{p_N}\\}$. Due to the antisymmetry requirement for fermions, which is mathematically enforced by the determinantal structure, the interchange of any two electrons (or equivalently, any two rows of the determinant) results in a change of sign of the wave function. A more direct consequence of the determinant structure is the Pauli exclusion principle: if any two spin-orbitals in the set are identical (i.e., $\\chi_{p_i} = \\chi_{p_j}$ for $i \\neq j$), the determinant vanishes. This means each spin-orbital can be occupied by at most one electron.\n\nCrucially, because electrons are indistinguishable particles, a Slater determinant is uniquely defined (up to an irrelevant overall phase factor, typically chosen as a sign) by the *set* of spin-orbitals it occupies. The problem correctly states that we must count distinct Slater determinants up to an overall sign. This simplifies the task to a combinatorial problem of counting the number of ways to choose distinct sets of occupied spin-orbitals.\n\nWe are given a reference state, which is a single Slater determinant, $\\Phi_0$, built from $n_o$ occupied spin-orbitals. The total basis consists of these $n_o$ occupied spin-orbitals and an additional $n_v$ unoccupied (virtual) spin-orbitals.\n\nFirst, we derive the number of singly excited determinants, $N_{\\mathrm{S}}$. A singly excited determinant, denoted $\\Phi_{i}^{a}$, is formed by promoting one electron from an occupied spin-orbital $\\chi_i$ to a virtual spin-orbital $\\chi_a$. This is equivalent to creating a new set of occupied spin-orbitals by removing one spin-orbital from the initial occupied set and adding one spin-orbital from the virtual set. The process can be decomposed into two independent choices:\n\n1.  Selection of the occupied spin-orbital to be depopulated. There are $n_o$ occupied spin-orbitals available. The number of ways to choose exactly $1$ spin-orbital from this set is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_o}{1}$.\n$$\n\\binom{n_o}{1} = \\frac{n_o!}{1!(n_o - 1)!} = n_o\n$$\n\n2.  Selection of the virtual spin-orbital to be populated. There are $n_v$ virtual spin-orbitals available. The number of ways to choose exactly $1$ spin-orbital from this set is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_v}{1}$.\n$$\n\\binom{n_v}{1} = \\frac{n_v!}{1!(n_v - 1)!} = n_v\n$$\n\nSince each choice of an occupied orbital can be combined with any choice of a virtual orbital to form a unique singly excited determinant, the total number of such determinants, $N_{\\mathrm{S}}$, is the product of the number of choices from each step. This is an application of the rule of product in combinatorics.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\binom{n_o}{1} \\times \\binom{n_v}{1} = n_o n_v\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the number of doubly excited determinants, $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$. A doubly excited determinant, denoted $\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}$, is formed by promoting two electrons from two distinct occupied spin-orbitals, $\\chi_i$ and $\\chi_j$, to two distinct virtual spin-orbitals, $\\chi_a$ and $\\chi_b$. The problem is to count the number of unique sets of occupied spin-orbitals that can be formed this way. This process is decomposed into two independent choices:\n\n1.  Selection of the two occupied spin-orbitals to be depopulated. We must choose a set of $2$ spin-orbitals from the $n_o$ available occupied spin-orbitals. Since the final determinant is specified by the set of orbitals, the order of selection is irrelevant (i.e., choosing $\\{\\chi_i, \\chi_j\\}$ is the same as choosing $\\{\\chi_j, \\chi_i\\}$). The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_o}{2}$.\n$$\n\\binom{n_o}{2} = \\frac{n_o!}{2!(n_o - 2)!} = \\frac{n_o(n_o - 1)}{2}\n$$\n\n2.  Selection of the two virtual spin-orbitals to be populated. Similarly, we must choose a set of $2$ spin-orbitals from the $n_v$ available virtual spin-orbitals. The order of selection does not matter. The number of ways is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_v}{2}$.\n$$\n\\binom{n_v}{2} = \\frac{n_v!}{2!(n_v - 2)!} = \\frac{n_v(n_v - 1)}{2}\n$$\n\nEach choice of a pair of occupied orbitals can be combined with any choice of a pair of virtual orbitals to form a unique doubly excited determinant.

The dimension of the CI space, $D_{CI}$, dictates the size of the Hamiltonian matrix, $\\mathbf{H}$, which must be constructed and diagonalized. The matrix has dimensions $D_{CI} \\times D_{CI}$. The computational cost of a CI calculation has two dominant components:\n$1$. Construction of the Hamiltonian matrix elements $H_{IJ} = \\langle \\Psi_I | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_J \\rangle$. The number of such elements is approximately $\\frac{1}{2}D_{CI}^2$.\n$2$. Diagonalization of the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ to obtain its eigenvalues (energies) and eigenvectors (wavefunctions). Standard diagonalization algorithms scale as $O(D_{CI}^3)$. For large problems, iterative methods like the Davidson algorithm are employed, with a cost that scales roughly as $O(N_{iter} D_{CI}^2)$ per root, where $N_{iter}$ is the number of iterations required for convergence.\n\nThe expressions derived show that $D_{CI}$ grows combinatorially with the excitation level $k$ and polynomially with the number of orbitals ($n_o$ and $n_v$). Specifically, for a fixed large $k$, $N_k \\sim O(n_o^k n_v^k)$. This rapid, factorial-like growth is known as the \"exponential wall\" of quantum chemistry. As seen from our calculation ($51 \\to 501 \\to 1701$), even for a small system and low excitation levels, the dimension of the CI matrix increases dramatically. This makes higher-order CI methods computationally prohibitive for all but the smallest molecular systems, necessitating the use of more computationally efficient, approximate methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 51 & 501 & 1701 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2881654"}, {"introduction": "While Slater determinants form a convenient mathematical basis, they are generally not eigenfunctions of the total spin-squared operator, $\\hat{S}^2$.

For instance, any singlet is orthogonal to any triplet.\nThe only remaining check is between the two $M_S=0$ CSFs arising from the $(a^1 b^1)$ configuration, ${}^{1}\\Psi_{ab}$ and ${}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0}$.\n$$ \\langle {}^{1}\\Psi_{ab} | {}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle (|\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle - |\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle) | (|\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle + |\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle) \\rangle $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} (\\langle |\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle | |\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle\\rangle + \\langle |\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle | |\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle\\rangle - \\langle |\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle | |\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle\\rangle - \\langle |\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle | |\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle\\rangle) $$\nThe two SDs $|\\phi_{a}\\alpha \\ \\phi_{b}\\beta\\rangle$ and $|\\phi_{a}\\beta \\ \\phi_{b}\\alpha\\rangle$ differ by two spin-orbitals, so their overlap is zero. The SDs are normalized.\n$$ \\langle {}^{1}\\Psi_{ab} | {}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 0 - 0 - 1) = 0 $$\nThus, the set of $6$ CSFs is orthonormal.\n\nFinally, we verify that the CSFs are eigenfunctions of $\\hat{S}^2 = \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}$ with the appropriate eigenvalues $S(S+1)\\hbar^2$. The operator $\\hat{S}^2$ acts only on the spin part of the wavefunction. The total spin operators are $\\hat{S}_{\\pm} = \\hat{S}_{1\\pm} + \\hat{S}_{2\\pm}$ and $\\hat{S}_z = \\hat{S}_{1z} + \\hat{S}_{2z}$. We use the given identities $\\hat{S}^{2} = \\hat{S}_{-}\\hat{S}_{+} + \\hat{S}_{z}(\\hat{S}_{z}+\\hbar)$ and $\\hat{S}^{2} = \\hat{S}_{+}\\hat{S}_{-} + \\hat{S}_{z}(\\hat{S}_{z}-\\hbar)$.\n\nFor any triplet state ${}^{3}\\Psi$:\nThe spin functions are $\\Theta_{1,+1} = \\alpha\\alpha$, $\\Theta_{1,0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\alpha)$, $\\Theta_{1,-1}=\\beta\\beta$.\nFor ${}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}$ (spin part $\\alpha\\alpha$): $M_S=1$.\n$\\hat{S}_{+}(\\alpha\\alpha) = (\\hat{S}_{1+}+\\hat{S}_{2+})\\alpha(1)\\alpha(2) = 0$.\n$\\hat{S}^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}) = (\\hat{S}_{-}\\hat{S}_{+} + \\hat{S}_{z}(\\hat{S}_{z}+\\hbar)){}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}$. Since $\\hat{S}_{+}{}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}=0$, the first term vanishes.\n$\\hat{S}_z({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}) = \\hbar({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1})$.\n$\\hat{S}^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}) = \\hbar(\\hbar+\\hbar)({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1}) = 2\\hbar^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,+1})$. This is the eigenvalue for $S=1$ ($1(1+1)\\hbar^2=2\\hbar^2$).\n\nFor ${}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1}$ (spin part $\\beta\\beta$): $M_S=-1$.\n$\\hat{S}_{-}(\\beta\\beta) = 0$. Using the second identity for $\\hat{S}^2$:\n$\\hat{S}^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1}) = (\\hat{S}_{+}\\hat{S}_{-} + \\hat{S}_{z}(\\hat{S}_{z}-\\hbar)){}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1}$. The $\\hat{S}_{+}\\hat{S}_{-}$ term is zero.\n$\\hat{S}_z({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1}) = -\\hbar({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1})$.\n$\\hat{S}^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1}) = -\\hbar(-\\hbar-\\hbar)({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1}) = 2\\hbar^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,-1})$. This is the eigenvalue for $S=1$.\n\nFor ${}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0}$ (spin part $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\alpha)$): $M_S=0$.\n$\\hat{S}_z({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0}) = 0$.\n$\\hat{S}^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0}) = \\hat{S}_{-}\\hat{S}_{+}({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0})$.\n$\\hat{S}_{+}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\alpha)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{S}_{1+}+\\hat{S}_{2+})(\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hbar\\alpha\\alpha + \\hbar\\alpha\\alpha) = \\sqrt{2}\\hbar(\\alpha\\alpha)$.\n$\\hat{S}_{-}(\\sqrt{2}\\hbar(\\alpha\\alpha)) = \\sqrt{2}\\hbar(\\hat{S}_{1-}+\\hat{S}_{2-})(\\alpha\\alpha) = \\sqrt{2}\\hbar(\\hbar\\beta\\alpha+\\hbar\\alpha\\beta) = 2\\hbar^2 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\alpha)$.\nSo, $\\hat{S}^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0}) = 2\\hbar^2({}^{3}\\Psi_{ab,0})$.
