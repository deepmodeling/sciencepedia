This practice explores a scenario where a CCSD(T) calculation gives an energy lower than the FCI result, a situation that might seem paradoxical at first [@problem_id:2453851]. Understanding why this is not an error is fundamental to correctly interpreting CCSD(T) results and appreciating the distinction between variational and non-variational methods.", "problem": "A student performs two electronic structure calculations on a fixed equilibrium geometry of a water molecule using the same finite one-electron basis set: a Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculation and a Coupled Cluster with Singles, Doubles, and Perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculation. The reported FCI total electronic energy is $-76.0000$ hartree, while the CCSD(T) energy is $-76.0002$ hartree, i.e., lower than the FCI value by $0.0002$ hartree. The student asks whether this is a mistake, since FCI is exact in a given finite basis set and should set a lower bound on approximate methods.\n\nStarting from the Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle and the definition of what makes a method variational versus non-variational in quantum chemistry, decide which statement best explains why the CCSD(T) value can be below the FCI value in the same basis and why this does not, by itself, imply an error.\n\nChoose one option:\n\n- A. The CCSD(T) method is not variational: its projected energy expression is not an expectation value with a Hermitian operator using the same bra and ket, so the Rayleigh–Ritz upper-bound property does not apply; therefore, $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)}}$ can lie below $E_{\\mathrm{FCI}}$ in a finite basis.\n\n- B.

Water exhibits near-degeneracy, and CCSD(T) becomes identical to FCI in such cases, so its energy can be slightly lower than FCI due to numerical noise.", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding the mathematical property of a method being \"variational\".\n\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle states that for any normalized trial wavefunction, $|\\Psi_{\\text{trial}}\\rangle$, the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}$, provides an upper bound to the exact ground-state energy, $E_0$.\n$$\nE_{\\text{trial}} = \\frac{\\langle\\Psi_{\\text{trial}}|\\hat{H}|\\Psi_{\\text{trial}}\\rangle}{\\langle\\Psi_{\\text{trial}}|\\Psi_{\\text{trial}}\\rangle} \\geq E_0\n$$\nAn electronic structure method is called **variational** if its energy is calculated precisely as this expectation value.\n\n**Full Configuration Interaction (FCI)** constructs its wavefunction, $|\\Psi_{\\text{FCI}}\\rangle$, as a linear combination of all possible Slater determinants within the given one-electron basis. The coefficients of this expansion are determined by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in this basis of determinants. This procedure is mathematically equivalent to minimizing the energy expectation value $\\langle\\Psi|\\hat{H}|\\Psi\\rangle$. Thus, FCI is a variational method. Within a given finite basis set, the FCI energy, $E_{\\text{FCI}}$, is the lowest possible energy, and it serves as the benchmark $E_0$ for that basis.\n\n**Coupled Cluster (CC) Theory** uses a different approach. The CC wavefunction is constructed via an exponential ansatz acting on a reference state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ (typically the Hartree-Fock determinant):\n$$\n|\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}\\rangle = e^{\\hat{T}}|\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2 + \\dots$ is the cluster operator that creates excitations. For CCSD, this is truncated to $\\hat{T} \\approx \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$.\n\nCrucially, the CC energy is **not** computed as the expectation value $\\langle\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}|\\hat{H}|\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}\\rangle$. Such an expression would yield a non-terminating series of terms that is computationally intractable. Instead, the energy is obtained by projecting the Schrödinger equation onto the reference and excited states. The energy expression for standard single-reference CC is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{CC}} = \\langle\\Phi_0|e^{-\\hat{T}}\\hat{H}e^{\\hat{T}}|\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle\\Phi_0|\\bar{H}|\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{H} = e^{-\\hat{T}}\\hat{H}e^{\\hat{T}}$ is a non-Hermitian, similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. Because this energy expression is not a true expectation value of the form $\\langle\\Psi|\\hat{H}|\\Psi\\rangle$ (it involves a projection and a non-Hermitian operator), the variational principle does not apply. Methods whose energy is not guaranteed to be an upper bound to the exact energy are called **non-variational**.\n\nThe **CCSD(T)** method further adds a perturbative correction for triple excitations, $E_{(T)}$, to the CCSD energy:\n$$\nE_{\\text{CCSD(T)}} = E_{\\text{CCSD}} + E_{(T)}\n$$\nThis perturbative correction is also non-variational. Therefore, the entire CCSD(T) method is non-variational.\n\nSince the variational principle does not hold for CCSD(T), there is no mathematical theorem that forces $E_{\\text{CCSD(T)}}$ to be greater than or equal to $E_{\\text{FCI}}$. While CCSD(T) is known for its high accuracy, the approximations inherent in its formulation can occasionally lead to a slight overestimation of the correlation energy, resulting in a total energy that falls below the exact FCI value for that basis set. This is a known feature of the method and does not indicate a computational error.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n- **A. The CCSD(T) method is not variational: its projected energy expression is not an expectation value with a Hermitian operator using the same bra and ket, so the Rayleigh–Ritz upper-bound property does not apply; therefore, $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)}}$ can lie below $E_{\\mathrm{FCI}}$ in a finite basis.**\n  This statement is a precise and correct explanation. It correctly identifies CCSD(T) as non-variational. It accurately describes the reason—the energy is found via a projection, not a true expectation value of the Hamiltonian with the wavefunction, which violates the conditions of the variational principle. The conclusion that $E_{\\text{CCSD(T)}}$ can be lower than $E_{\\text{FCI}}$ is the correct consequence.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Because coupled cluster theory is size-extensive, it always yields a lower energy than FCI in any finite basis.**\n  This statement is flawed. While coupled cluster theory is size-extensive (a desirable property for calculating energies of large systems), this property is unrelated to the variational character of the energy. Size-extensivity ensures that the energy scales correctly with the number of non-interacting particles, but it does not dictate the energy's position relative to the FCI value. Furthermore, the claim that it *always* yields a lower energy is false; $E_{\\text{CCSD(T)}}$ can be higher than, equal to, or lower than $E_{\\text{FCI}}$ depending on the system.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. The CCSD(T) calculation must have used a larger basis set than the FCI calculation; otherwise it would be impossible for $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)}}$ to be less than $E_{\\mathrm{FCI}}$.**\n  This statement directly contradicts a premise of the problem, which explicitly states that \"**the same finite one-electron basis set**\" was used. The explanation for the energy ordering lies in the intrinsic properties of the methods, not in a violation of the problem's conditions.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. The perturbative triples correction in CCSD(T) double-counts correlation energy by construction, which guarantees an energy below FCI.**\n  The `(T)` correction is a systematic approximation derived from many-body perturbation theory; it is not designed to \"double-count\" energy. While its non-variational nature can lead to an overcorrection (energy too low), this is not a guaranteed outcome, nor is it due to a crude flaw like \"double-counting by construction.\" The claim that this *guarantees* an energy below FCI is false.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Water exhibits near-degeneracy, and CCSD(T) becomes identical to FCI in such cases, so its energy can be slightly lower than FCI due to numerical noise.**\n  This statement contains multiple errors. Water at its equilibrium geometry is a well-behaved, single-reference system and does not exhibit significant near-degeneracy. CCSD(T) does not become identical to FCI for a $10$-electron system like water; it is only identical to FCI for $2$-electron systems. Single-reference CCSD(T) performs poorly, not better, in cases of true near-degeneracy. Finally, the energy difference of $0.0002$ hartree is physically significant and not attributable to numerical noise, which is many orders of magnitude smaller.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2453851"}, {"introduction": "The CCSD(T) method's success hinges on the assumption that triple excitations are a small, perturbative correction to the picture provided by singles and doubles.

In the CCSD method, the cluster operator is truncated to single and double excitations, $\\hat{T} \\approx \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$. The correlation energy is primarily captured by the double excitations operator, $\\hat{T}_2$, which describes the correlated motion of electron pairs. For any system where the single-reference approach is appropriate, the contribution of double excitations to the correlation energy is dominant.\n\nThe CCSD(T) method seeks to improve upon CCSD by including an estimate for the effect of connected triple excitations. This is done non-iteratively using a formula derived from many-body perturbation theory, which uses the converged T-amplitudes from the CCSD calculation. The total CCSD(T) energy is the sum of the CCSD energy and this perturbative triples correction, $E_{(T)}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)}} = E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} + E_{(T)}$$\nCorrespondingly, for the correlation energy:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{corr}}^{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)}} = E_{\\mathrm{corr}}^{\\mathrm{CCSD}} + E_{(T)}$$\nThe fundamental assumption of any perturbative correction is that the correction itself is small compared to the energy of the zeroth-order or reference state.

This is a catastrophic failure of the perturbative assumption. Such a result indicates that the single-reference description of the molecule is fundamentally flawed, a condition known as strong or static correlation (multi-reference character). When the Hartree-Fock reference is poor and there are other low-lying determinants with significant weight in the true wave function, the single-reference CC hierarchy breaks down. The very small CCSD correlation energy is a symptom of this breakdown, and the enormous triples correction is another. In such cases, the CCSD(T) energy is unreliable and provides no meaningful chemical insight.

The result is plausible; triple excitations often dominate the correlation energy by hundreds of millihartree, so CCSD(T) appropriately recovers the missing correlation that CCSD neglects.\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect.

It correctly identifies the result as \"implausible\" in the context of a reliable calculation. It correctly states the central requirement of the perturbative approach: the correction must be small. It correctly diagnoses the large disparity between the CCSD and CCSD(T) energies as a \"breakdown of the single-reference/perturbative assumptions.\" Finally, it draws the correct conclusion: the CCSD(T) result is \"unreliable.\" This analysis is perfectly aligned with established theory.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. The result is plausible for a very small basis set; basis-set incompleteness prevents CCSD from describing correlation, but the perturbative triples step can recover most of it, hence the large difference.\nThis statement is nonsensical.

A small basis set limits the ability of *both* CCSD and the subsequent `(T)` correction to capture correlation energy.

A principal theoretical strength of coupled cluster theory is its rigorous size-extensivity. This property holds for truncated CC methods such as CCSD. The standard formulation of the perturbative triples correction, `(T)`, is also designed to be size-extensive. Therefore, both CCSD and CCSD(T) are size-extensive methods.

The energy correction, often denoted $E_T$, contains denominators of the form $\\epsilon_i + \\epsilon_j + \\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_c$, where $\\epsilon_p$ are HF orbital energies for occupied ($i, j, k$) and virtual ($a, b, c$) orbitals.
