For a one-electron system, the exact ground-state energy is the expectation value of the one-electron Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, which has no electron-electron interaction term. In the Kohn-Sham formalism, the total energy is $E[n] = T_s[n] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] + E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n]$. Since $T_s[n]$ and $E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n]$ are defined to be the kinetic and external potential energies of the non-interacting KS system that reproduces the density $n$, for this one-electron system they are identical to the true kinetic and potential energies. Therefore, for the DFT energy to equal the exact energy, we must have $E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n] = 0$. The exchange-correlation energy is composed of the exchange energy $E_{x}[n]$ and the correlation energy $E_{c}[n]$. The correlation energy is defined as the difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy; for a one-electron system, these are identical, so $E_{c}[n]$ is zero. The condition $E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n] = 0$ therefore simplifies to $E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{x}[n] = 0$. This demonstrates that the exchange energy exactly cancels the spurious self-interaction contained in the Hartree energy, i.e., $E_x[n] = -E_H[n]$.\n\nWith $E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{x}[n] + E_{c}[n] = 0$, the total energy simplifies to $E[n] = T_s[n] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n]$. We now evaluate these two terms.\nThe single normalized KS orbital $\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})$ that reproduces the density $n(r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\exp(-2r)$ is $\\varphi(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-r)$, as the ground state orbital can be chosen to be real and positive.\nThe external potential energy is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] = \\int v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d^3r = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\exp(-2r)\\right) 4\\pi r^2 dr$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] = -4 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r\\exp(-2r) dr = -4 \\left(\\frac{1!}{2^2}\\right) = -4 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -1 \\text{ Hartree}$$\nThe Kohn-Sham kinetic energy is $T_s[n] = \\int \\varphi^*(\\mathbf{r})(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2)\\varphi(\\mathbf{r}) d^3r$. Using integration by parts (Green's first identity), this is equivalent to:\n$$T_s[n] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int |\\nabla \\varphi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 d^3r$$\nFor our radial orbital, $\\nabla\\varphi(r) = \\frac{d\\varphi}{dr}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\varphi(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\nThus, $|\\nabla \\varphi(r)|^2 = (\\nabla\\varphi) \\cdot (\\nabla\\varphi) = (-\\varphi\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) \\cdot (-\\varphi\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) = \\varphi(r)^2 = n(r)$.\n$$T_s[n] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int n(r) d^3r$$\nSince the density is normalized to one electron, $\\int n(r) d^3r = 1$.\n$$T_s[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ Hartree}$$\n\nFinally, we combine the components to obtain the total ground-state energy:\n$$E[n] = T_s[n] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] = \\frac{1}{2} + (-1) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ Hartree}$$\nThis result matches the known exact energy of the hydrogen atom, as expected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2634155"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the ideal behavior of the exact functional for a one-electron system, we now investigate a key failure of common approximations.

A function is convex if its curve lies at or below the straight line segment connecting its endpoints. This means $\\delta(N) = E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N) - L(N) \\leq 0$ for $N \\in [0,1]$. Our negative result for $\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ is consistent with convexity.\n\nThe linearity of the exact energy, $E(N)$, for a one-electron system arises from the perfect cancellation of the spurious self-interaction Hartree energy, $E_{H}[n_{N}]$, by the exact exchange-correlation energy, $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{exact}}[n_{N}] = -E_{H}[n_{N}]$. The non-linear terms in the approximate GGA energy are $E_{H}[n_{N}]$ and $E_{x}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_{N}]$. The source of the non-linear deviation $\\delta(N)$ is the sum of these two terms.\nThe Hartree energy scales as $E_{H}[n_{N}] = U_{1}N^{2}$. A function proportional to $N^2$ is inherently convex (its second derivative is a positive constant, $2U_1$).\nThe approximate GGA exchange energy scales as $E_{x}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_{N}] = -\\lambda U_{1}N^{4/3}$. A function proportional to $-N^{4/3}$ is concave (its second derivative is $-\\frac{4\\lambda U_1}{9}N^{-2/3}$, which is negative).\n\nThe total energy curve's curvature is determined by the competition between the convex Hartree term and the concave approximate exchange term. The total non-linear part of the energy is $E_{\\mathrm{nl}}(N) = U_{1}N^{2} - \\lambda U_{1}N^{4/3}$. The exact exchange energy would have to scale in such a way as to perfectly cancel the $N^2$ term from the Hartree energy. The GGA exchange, with its $N^{4/3}$ scaling, fails to do this. Because the exponent of the convex Hartree term ($2$) is greater than the exponent of the concave exchange term ($4/3$), the convex behavior of the Hartree self-interaction dominates the overall shape of the energy curve. This incomplete cancellation of the self-interaction in the GGA leads to a residual convex curvature, causing the total energy $E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N)$ to bow downwards below the straight-line interpolation.

The ionization energy for the $N$-electron system is the minimum energy required to remove an electron, defined as:\n$$ I = E(N-1) - E(N) $$\nThe electron affinity is the energy released upon adding an electron, defined as:\n$$ A = E(N) - E(N+1) $$\n\nThe problem provides the necessary total energies for the system with $N=2$ electrons:\n- $E(N-1) = E(1) = -1.00 \\text{ eV}$\n- $E(N) = E(2) = -3.00 \\text{ eV}$\n- $E(N+1) = E(3) = -4.20 \\text{ eV}$\n\nUsing these values, we calculate the ionization energy $I$:\n$$ I = E(1) - E(2) = (-1.00 \\text{ eV}) - (-3.00 \\text{ eV}) = 2.00 \\text{ eV} $$\nNext, we calculate the electron affinity $A$:\n$$ A = E(2) - E(3) = (-3.00 \\text{ eV}) - (-4.20 \\text{ eV}) = 1.20 \\text{ eV} $$\nWith $I$ and $A$ determined, the fundamental gap $E_g$ is:\n$$ E_g = I - A = 2.00 \\text{ eV} - 1.20 \\text{ eV} = 0.80 \\text{ eV} $$\n\nNow, we turn to the Kohn-Sham gap, $E_g^{\\text{KS}}$. This is defined as the difference between the single-particle energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) calculated for the $N$-electron system.\n$$ E_g^{\\text{KS}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(N) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N) $$\n\nThe problem provides the self-consistent KS eigenvalues for the $N=2$ system:\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N) = -2.00 \\text{ eV}$\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(N) = -1.50 \\text{ eV}$\n\nUsing these values, we compute the Kohn-Sham gap:\n$$ E_g^{\\text{KS}} = (-1.50 \\text{ eV}) - (-2.00 \\text{ eV}) = 0.50 \\text{ eV} $$\n\nIt is a crucial consistency check to note that for the exact density and exact KS potential, the HOMO energy is exactly the negative of the ionization energy: $\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N) = -I$. Our calculated ionization energy is $I=2.00 \\text{ eV}$, so $-I = -2.00 \\text{ eV}$. This matches the given $\\varepsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(N) = -2.00 \\text{ eV}$, which confirms the internal consistency of the problem statement under the assumption that the KS calculation yields the exact KS potential for the given density.\n\nFinally, we can determine the exchange-correlation derivative discontinuity $\\Delta_{\\text{xc}}$ by rearranging the primary relation:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{xc}} = E_g - E_g^{\\text{KS}} $$\nSubstituting our calculated values for the gaps:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{xc}} = 0.80 \\text{ eV} - 0.50 \\text{ eV} = 0.30 \\text{ eV} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.30$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we append a zero.\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{xc}} = 0.300 \\text{ eV} $$\nThis value represents the abrupt change in the exchange-correlation potential as the number of electrons crosses the integer value $N=2$, a purely many-body effect that is absent from the single-particle Kohn-Sham picture but essential for obtaining the correct fundamental gap of the physical system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.300}$$", "id": "2634174"}]}
