By implementing diagnostics on a model energy function, you will quantitatively measure the deviation from linearity and classify it, building a fundamental understanding of why these errors arise and how they can be diagnosed.", "problem": "You will design and implement a program that computes principled diagnostics of delocalization error in Density Functional Theory (DFT). The exact Perdew–Parr–Levy–Balduz (PPLB) piecewise linearity condition states that for a system with fractional electron number between two adjacent integers, the exact ground-state total energy $E$ varies linearly. Any deviation from this linearity arises from self-interaction and delocalization errors. Your task is to quantify such deviations for a small family of model systems by computing diagnostics derived from this linearity principle.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Exact DFT obeys the PPLB piecewise linearity: between integers $N$ and $N+1$, the exact ground-state energy $E(N+\\eta)$ is linear in the fractional occupation $\\eta \\in [0,1]$.\n- For any approximate energy $E(x)$, define the linear reference $E_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) = (1-x) E_0 + x E_1$, where $E_0 = E(0)$ and $E_1 = E(1)$.\n- Deviations from $E_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$ quantify delocalization error and many-electron self-interaction error.\n\nProgram inputs to be hard-coded (no user input) and used as a test suite:\nConsider a family of model systems whose total energy as a function of fractional electron number $x \\in [0,1]$ is defined by\n$$\nE(x) \\;=\\; (1-x)\\,E_0 \\;+\\; x\\,E_1 \\;+\\; a\\,x(1-x) \\;+\\; c\\,x(1-x)(1-2x),\n$$\nwith $E_0$ and $E_1$ in Hartree and parameters $a$ and $c$ in Hartree.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Density Functional Theory (DFT), specifically the Perdew–Parr–Levy–Balduz (PPLB) condition for fractional electron numbers. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters, models, and computational procedures explicitly defined. It is an objective and formalizable task in computational quantum chemistry. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis hinges on quantifying the deviation of an approximate energy functional from the exact piecewise-linear behavior. The model energy for a fractional number of electrons $x \\in [0,1]$ is given by:\n$$\nE(x) = (1-x)E_0 + xE_1 + a x(1-x) + c x(1-x)(1-2x)\n$$\nwhere $E_0$ and $E_1$ are the energies of the system with $0$ and $1$ fractional electrons, respectively. The parameters $a$ and $c$ introduce non-linear deviations.\n\nThe reference for perfect linearity is defined as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x) = (1-x)E_0 + xE_1\n$$\nThe deviation from linearity, which is the source of the delocalization error in this model, is the difference $d(x) = E(x) - E_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$. Substituting the expressions for $E(x)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$ yields a simplified form for the deviation:\n$$\nd(x) = [ (1-x)E_0 + xE_1 + a x(1-x) + c x(1-x)(1-2x) ] - [ (1-x)E_0 + xE_1 ]\n$$\n$$\nd(x) = a x(1-x) + c x(1-x)(1-2x) = x(1-x)[a + c(1-2x)]\n$$\nThis function $d(x)$ will be the basis for computing the required diagnostics. All energy parameters ($E_0$, $E_1$, $a$, $c$) are in Hartrees, so $d(x)$ is also in Hartrees.\n\nThe computational procedure for each diagnostic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Grid Discretization**: We establish a uniform grid of $N=1001$ points for the fractional electron number $x$ over the interval $[0,1]$. Let these points be $x_i = i/(N-1)$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. The step size is $h = 1/(N-1)$. We evaluate $d(x_i)$ at each grid point.\n\n2.  **$L^1$ Deviation ($D_1$)**: This metric measures the total absolute deviation. It is defined by the integral:\n    $$\n    D_1 = \\int_0^1 |d(x)| \\, dx\n    $$\n    We approximate this integral numerically using the composite trapezoidal rule on our grid:\n    $$\n    D_1 \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\frac{|d(x_{i-1})| + |d(x_i)|}{2} h = h \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} |d(x_i)| + \\frac{|d(x_0)| + |d(x_{N-1})|}{2} \\right)\n    $$\n    Since $d(0)=0$ and $d(1)=0$, this simplifies. The result is in Hartrees and must be converted to electronvolts (eV) using the given conversion factor $1\\,\\text{Hartree} = 27.211386245988\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\n3.  **$L^2$ RMS Deviation ($D_2$)**: This metric is the root-mean-square deviation, sensitive to larger deviations.\n    $$\n    D_2 = \\sqrt{\\int_0^1 d(x)^2 \\, dx}\n    $$\n    The integral part is computed using the trapezoidal rule on the values of $d(x)^2$, followed by taking the square root. The result is also in Hartrees and requires conversion to eV.\n\n4.  **Midpoint Curvature ($K$)**: This is a discrete measure of the concavity or convexity of the energy curve. It is defined as:\n    $$\n    K = E(1) - 2E(\\tfrac{1}{2}) + E(0)\n    $$\n    Instead of numerical evaluation on the grid, we can derive an exact analytical expression. We know $E(0) = E_0$ and $E(1) = E_1$. We evaluate $E(\\tfrac{1}{2})$:\n    $$\n    E(\\tfrac{1}{2}) = (1-\\tfrac{1}{2})E_0 + \\tfrac{1}{2}E_1 + a(\\tfrac{1}{2})(1-\\tfrac{1}{2}) + c(\\tfrac{1}{2})(1-\\tfrac{1}{2})(1-2 \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2})\n    $$\n    $$\n    E(\\tfrac{1}{2}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}E_0 + \\tfrac{1}{2}E_1 + \\tfrac{a}{4}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $K$:\n    $$\n    K = E_1 - 2\\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}E_0 + \\tfrac{1}{2}E_1 + \\tfrac{a}{4} \\right) + E_0 = E_1 - E_0 - E_1 - \\tfrac{a}{2} + E_0 = -\\frac{a}{2}\n    $$\n    This elegant result shows that the midpoint curvature is determined solely by the parameter $a$. The value of $K$ is in Hartrees and must be converted to eV.\n\n5.  **Normalized Curvature ($s$)**: This dimensionless quantity normalizes the curvature by the energy difference across the interval.\n    $$\n    s = \\frac{K}{|E_1 - E_0|}\n    $$\n    We compute this using the values of $K$, $E_1$, and $E_0$ in Hartrees to ensure dimensional consistency before the ratio is taken.\n\n6.  **Over-Delocalization Flag**: This boolean flag indicates the sign of the curvature. A convex curve ($E(x) < E_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)$), characteristic of delocalization error, corresponds to a positive curvature.\n    $$\n    \\text{over\\_delocalized} = (K > 0)\n    $$\n    From our derivation $K = -a/2$, this condition is equivalent to $a < 0$.\n\nThe implementation will systematically apply these calculations to each of the $4$ given parameter sets, format the results according to the specified precision, and present them in the required list-of-lists structure.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes DFT delocalization error diagnostics for a family of model systems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the Hartree-to-electronvolt conversion factor.\n    HARTREE_TO_EV = 27.211386245988\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (E0, E1, a, c) in Hartrees.\n    test_cases = [\n        (-100.0, -100.2, 0.0, 0.0),     # Case 1: Perfectly piecewise-linear\n        (-100.0, -100.2, -0.01, 0.0),    # Case 2: Delocalization/convex error\n        (-100.0, -100.2, 0.01, 0.0),     # Case 3: Over-localization/concave error\n        (-100.0, -100.2, -0.008, -0.006) # Case 4: Skewed delocalization\n    ]\n\n    # Grid parameters for numerical integration.\n    N_POINTS = 1001\n    x_grid = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, N_POINTS)\n\n    results_all_cases = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        E0, E1, a, c = case\n\n        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # 1.

Base your reasoning only on first principles and well-tested facts: (i) the ionization potential $I$ is defined as the total energy difference $I = E(N-1) - E(N)$ for $N$ electrons at fixed nuclear geometry (vertical ionization), (ii) Kohn–Sham (KS) DFT with the exact functional satisfies the ionization potential theorem, which states that the highest occupied KS eigenvalue equals the negative of the ionization potential, $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = I$, and (iii) approximate exchange–correlation functionals suffer from self-interaction error and associated delocalization error that typically cause $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ to underestimate $I$, whereas $\\Delta\\mathrm{SCF}$ often reduces this bias.\n\nYour program must, for each exchange–correlation functional, compute the following metrics from the provided data:\n- For each molecule $i$, compute the KS frontier-orbital estimate of the ionization potential $I^{\\mathrm{H}}_i = -\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO},i}$ and the $\\Delta\\mathrm{SCF}$ estimate $I^{\\Delta}_i = E_{N-1,i} - E_{N,i}$, both in electronvolts.\n- For each method $m \\in \\{\\mathrm{H}, \\Delta\\}$, form the signed error array $\\{e^{m}_i\\}$ where $e^{m}_i = I^{m}_i - I^{\\mathrm{exp}}_i$ relative to experimental ionization potentials $I^{\\mathrm{exp}}_i$.\n- For each method, compute the mean signed error $\\mathrm{MSE}^{m} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^M e^{m}_i$ and the mean absolute error $\\mathrm{MAE}^{m} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^M |e^{m}_i|$.\n- Define a self-interaction bias difference $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\mathrm{MSE}^{\\mathrm{H}} - \\mathrm{MSE}^{\\Delta}$ and a self-interaction bias ratio $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{ratio}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{MAE}^{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\mathrm{MAE}^{\\Delta}}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of density functional theory (DFT), is well-posed with all necessary data and definitions provided, and is framed objectively. The task is to implement a computational analysis of two common approximations for the ionization potential within DFT—one based on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and the other on total energy differences ($\\Delta$SCF)—and to relate their performance to the known issue of self-interaction error in approximate exchange-correlation functionals.\n\nThe theoretical foundation of this problem rests on three key concepts in electronic structure theory.\n\nFirst, the vertical ionization potential, $I$, is rigorously defined as the difference in total energy between the $(N-1)$-electron system and the $N$-electron system, at the fixed geometry of the $N$-electron ground state. This is expressed as:\n$$\nI = E(N-1) - E(N)\n$$\nThis method of calculating the ionization potential is known as the $\\Delta$ self-consistent field ($\\Delta\\mathrm{SCF}$) approach, denoted here as $I^{\\Delta}$. It requires two separate, computationally intensive SCF calculations.\n\nSecond, for the *exact* Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT functional, a fundamental theorem, often referred to as the ionization potential theorem or Janak's theorem, states that the negative of the highest occupied KS eigenvalue, $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$, is precisely equal to the first ionization potential:\n$$\n-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = I\n$$\nThis provides a direct, computationally inexpensive route to the ionization potential, denoted here as $I^{\\mathrm{H}}$.\n\nThird, the exchange-correlation functionals used in practical DFT calculations (such as LDA, PBE, B3LYP) are *approximate*. A primary deficiency of many such functionals is the self-interaction error (SIE), where an electron unphysically interacts with its own charge density. This error is not uniform across all orbitals and tends to destabilize occupied orbitals, pushing their energies upward (making them less negative). The HOMO is typically the most affected. Consequently, for an approximate functional, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ is artificially high, and as a result, the estimate $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ systematically underestimates the true ionization potential $I$. This phenomenon is also linked to delocalization error, where approximate functionals erroneously favor spatially delocalized electronic densities over correctly localized ones, which also contributes to the erroneous elevation of $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$. The $\\Delta\\mathrm{SCF}$ method, $I^{\\Delta}$, while also employing an approximate functional, often yields more accurate results because the self-interaction error present in the total energies $E(N)$ and $E(N-1)$ partially cancels out in their difference. Hybrid functionals like B3LYP incorporate a fraction of exact exchange, which explicitly cancels a portion of the self-interaction, and are therefore expected to show a smaller underestimation bias in $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ compared to LDA or PBE.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows. For each of the three functionals (LDA, PBE, B3LYP), we will perform the following steps using the provided data for the four molecules (He, Ne, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\\mathrm{N_2}$), where the number of molecules is $M=4$.\n\n1.  The experimental ionization potentials are given as the array $I^{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\{I^{\\mathrm{exp}}_i\\}_{i=1}^M$.\n\n2.  For each molecule $i$, calculate the two theoretical estimates of the ionization potential:\n    -   The HOMO-based estimate: $I^{\\mathrm{H}}_i = -\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO},i}$.\n    -   The $\\Delta\\mathrm{SCF}$ estimate: $I^{\\Delta}_i = E_{N-1,i} - E_{N,i}$.\n    This produces two arrays of predicted values, $I^{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $I^{\\Delta}$.\n\n3.  For each method $m \\in \\{\\mathrm{H}, \\Delta\\}$, compute the signed errors relative to the experimental values:\n    $$\n    e^{m}_i = I^{m}_i - I^{\\mathrm{exp}}_i\n    $$\n    This yields two error arrays, $\\{e^{\\mathrm{H}}_i\\}$ and $\\{e^{\\Delta}_i\\}$.\n\n4.  From these error arrays, compute the mean signed error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for each method:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{MSE}^{m} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^M e^{m}_i\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{MAE}^{m} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^M |e^{m}_i|\n    $$\n    The MSE quantifies the systematic bias (under- or overestimation), while the MAE measures the average magnitude of the error.\n\n5.  Calculate the self-interaction bias metrics, which compare the performance of the two theoretical methods:\n    -   Bias difference: $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\mathrm{MSE}^{\\mathrm{H}} - \\mathrm{MSE}^{\\Delta}$. A large negative value indicates that the HOMO-based method systematically underestimates the IP much more severely than the $\\Delta\\mathrm{SCF}$ method.\n    -   Bias ratio: $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{ratio}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{MAE}^{\\mathrm{H}}}{\\mathrm{MAE}^{\\Delta}}$. A value much greater than $1$ indicates that the HOMO-based method is significantly less accurate on average.\n\n6.  Finally, assess the correlation of each method with experimental data by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient, $r(I^{m}, I^{\\mathrm{exp}})$, defined as:\n    $$\n    r(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^M (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^M (X_i - \\bar{X})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^M (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}}\n    $$\n    where $X$ represents the theoretical values ($I^{\\mathrm{H}}$ or $I^{\\Delta}$) and $Y$ represents the experimental values ($I^{\\mathrm{exp}}$). A value of $r$ close to $1$ indicates a strong positive linear relationship.\n\nThis sequence of calculations will be implemented for each functional, and the eight resulting metrics will be collected and formatted as specified. The results are expected to quantitatively demonstrate the theoretical principles: a large negative bias in $I^{\\mathrm{H}}$ that decreases from LDA to PBE to B3LYP, the superior accuracy and smaller bias of $I^{\\Delta}$, and consequently $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{diff}} < 0$ and $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{ratio}} > 1$ for all functionals.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a frontier-orbital based metric for comparing DFT approximations\n    of ionization potentials and relates trends to self-interaction errors.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Experimental Ionization Potentials in eV for [He, Ne, H2O, N2]\n    exp_ips = np.array([24.59, 21.56, 12.62, 15.58])\n\n    # Data for each functional.\n    # Structure: {homo_ev: [...], e_n: [...], e_n_minus_1: [...]}\n    test_cases = [\n        { # LDA\n            'name': 'LDA',\n            'homo_ev': np.array([-15.5, -13.0, -6.8, -8.9]),\n            'e_n': np.array([-80.0, -3500.0, -2075.0, -2960.0]),\n            'e_n_minus_1': np.array([-56.1, -3479.0, -2062.7, -2944.8]),\n        },\n        { # PBE\n            'name': 'PBE',\n            'homo_ev': np.array([-16.8, -14.5, -7.2, -9.8]),\n            'e_n': np.array([-79.5, -3500.5, -2075.3, -2960.5]),\n            'e_n_minus_1': np.array([-55.3, -3479.3, -2062.9, -2945.2]),\n        },\n        { # B3LYP\n            'name': 'B3LYP',\n            'homo_ev': np.array([-20.5, -17.8, -8.3, -11.7]),\n            'e_n': np.array([-79.2, -3501.0, -2075.6, -2961.0]),\n            'e_n_minus_1': np.array([-54.7, -3479.6, -2063.1, -2945.6]),\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for functional_data in test_cases:\n        # 1.

This is particularly critical in transition metal chemistry, where the degree of metal-ligand covalency is often incorrectly described by approximate functionals. In this hands-on practice [@problem_id:2804353], you will use a tractable two-level model to simulate how the tendency of different functionals to over- or under-delocalize electrons impacts the predicted spin density distribution and ligand-field splitting in a model octahedral complex.", "problem": "You will model how self-interaction and delocalization errors in Density Functional Theory (DFT) influence spin-density distributions and predicted ligand-field splitting for a high-spin iron complex, using a simple and universal two-level mixing framework that can be implemented by any developer. The system is an octahedral, high-spin iron center with a formal $d^5$ configuration, where the five metal $d$ orbitals split into a triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a doubly degenerate $e_g$ set. Each metal $d$ orbital of given symmetry mixes with a single symmetry-adapted ligand orbital to form a two-level problem. You must model the three kinds of approximate DFT treatments—Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), hybrid functional, and Self-Interaction Correction (SIC)—by a single parameter that scales the metal–ligand coupling, representing the severity of self-interaction driven delocalization.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions:\n- A high-spin $d^5$ configuration has five unpaired electrons, one occupying each $d$-derived orbital with spin-up ($\\alpha$), and zero spin-down ($\\beta$) occupancy. By definition, the spin density on any site is the difference between the integrated spin-up and spin-down electron populations on that site.\n- Each $d$ orbital of a given symmetry mixes only with a single, symmetry-matched ligand orbital, and the resulting quantum states are obtained by diagonalizing a $2 \\times 2$ Hermitian Hamiltonian for each orbital symmetry. This is a standard two-level mixing model from linear algebra and quantum mechanics.\n- For each orbital symmetry $s \\in \\{ t, e \\}$ (with $t$ representing $t_{2g}$ and $e$ representing $e_g$), use the Hamiltonian\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_s \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} & V_s^{(\\text{eff})} \\\\\nV_s^{(\\text{eff})} & \\varepsilon_L\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_d^{(t)} = 0$ (reference), $\\varepsilon_d^{(e)} = \\Delta_0$ is the bare ligand-field splitting, $\\varepsilon_L$ is the energy of the symmetry-adapted ligand orbital, and $V_s^{(\\text{eff})}$ is the effective metal–ligand coupling for symmetry $s$.\n- To model self-interaction and delocalization errors, define the effective couplings by scaling a base coupling with a functional-dependent factor,\n$$\nV_s^{(\\text{eff})} \\;=\\; s_f \\, V_s,\n$$\nwith the scale factors fixed as $s_{\\text{GGA}} = 1.20$, $s_{\\text{HYB}} = 1.00$, and $s_{\\text{SIC}} = 0.80$. This models that Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) over-delocalizes (stronger effective coupling), hybrid functionals are intermediate, and Self-Interaction Correction (SIC) localizes (weaker effective coupling).\n- For each symmetry $s$, diagonalize $\\mathbf{H}_s$ to obtain the upper (antibonding) eigenstate energy $E_{+,s}$ and its normalized eigenvector. Let the metal $d$-orbital coefficient in this eigenvector be $c_{d,s}$; then the metal-character fraction in the upper state is $|c_{d,s}|^2$. Because the configuration is high-spin $d^5$ with one $\\alpha$ electron in each of the five $d$-derived upper states and no $\\beta$ electrons, the total metal spin density is\n$$\n\\rho_M \\;=\\; 3 \\, |c_{d,t}|^2 \\;+\\; 2 \\, |c_{d,e}|^2,\n$$\nand the ligand spin density is $5 - \\rho_M$.

Use the resulting eigenvector to compute the metal-character fraction $|c_{d,s}|^2$ in that upper state.\n2. Compute the total metal spin density $\\rho_M$ as specified above.\n3. Compute the predicted ligand-field splitting $\\Delta_{\\text{pred}}$ in electronvolts.\n4. Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ across the three functional types between $\\rho_M$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{pred}}$ as defined above.\n5. For each test case, output a list of seven floats in the following order: $[\\rho_M^{\\text{GGA}}, \\rho_M^{\\text{HYB}}, \\rho_M^{\\text{SIC}}, \\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^{\\text{GGA}}, \\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^{\\text{HYB}}, \\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^{\\text{SIC}}, r]$. Round all floats to six decimal places.

It presents a simplified but coherent model for investigating the effects of self-interaction and delocalization errors in Density Functional Theory (DFT) on the electronic structure of a high-spin transition metal complex. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary parameters, definitions, and computational tasks. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is the diagonalization of a $2 \\times 2$ Hermitian matrix representing the interaction between a metal $d$-orbital and a symmetry-adapted ligand orbital. For each orbital symmetry $s \\in \\{t, e\\}$ (representing $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$) and each functional type characterized by a scaling factor $s_f$, the Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{s,f} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} & V_s^{(\\text{eff})} \\\\\nV_s^{(\\text{eff})} & \\varepsilon_L\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} & s_f V_s \\\\\ns_f V_s & \\varepsilon_L\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_d^{(s)}$ is the energy of the metal $d$-orbital of symmetry $s$, $\\varepsilon_L$ is the ligand orbital energy, $V_s$ is the base metal-ligand coupling, and $s_f$ is the scaling factor for the functional ($s_{\\text{GGA}} = 1.20$, $s_{\\text{HYB}} = 1.00$, $s_{\\text{SIC}} = 0.80$).\n\nThe eigenvalues $E$ of this Hamiltonian are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{H}_{s,f} - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$, which is a quadratic equation in $E$. The two solutions are:\n$$\nE_{\\pm,s,f} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} + \\varepsilon_L}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} - \\varepsilon_L)^2 + 4(s_f V_s)^2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the upper (antibonding) eigenvalue, which corresponds to the higher energy solution, denoted $E_{+,s,f}$ (using the '$+$' sign).\n\nThe corresponding eigenvector for the antibonding state, $|\\psi_{+,s,f}\\rangle = c_{d,s,f}|d_s\\rangle + c_{L,s,f}|L_s\\rangle$, must be determined to find the metal character, $|c_{d,s,f}|^2$. By solving the eigenvalue equation $(\\mathbf{H}_{s,f} - E_{+,s,f}\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{c} = 0$ and applying the normalization condition $|c_{d,s,f}|^2 + |c_{L,s,f}|^2 = 1$, we derive the expression for the metal $d$-orbital's fractional contribution to the antibonding state:\n$$\n|c_{d,s,f}|^2 = \\frac{(s_f V_s)^2}{(s_f V_s)^2 + (\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} - E_{+,s,f})^2}\n$$\nIn the special case where coupling is zero ($V_s = 0$), the orbitals do not mix. The upper eigenstate is simply the higher energy of the two basis orbitals, $\\varepsilon_d^{(s)}$ or $\\varepsilon_L$. If $\\varepsilon_d^{(s)} > \\varepsilon_L$, then $E_{+,s,f} = \\varepsilon_d^{(s)}$ and the state is pure metal, so $|c_{d,s,f}|^2 = 1$. If $\\varepsilon_L > \\varepsilon_d^{(s)}$, then $E_{+,s,f} = \\varepsilon_L$ and the state is pure ligand, so $|c_{d,s,f}|^2 = 0$.\n\nWith these quantities calculated for each symmetry ($s=t,e$) and functional ($f \\in \\{\\text{GGA}, \\text{HYB}, \\text{SIC}\\}$), we can assemble the required observables.\nThe total metal spin density $\\rho_M^f$ is computed based on the high-spin $d^5$ configuration, where one electron occupies each of the five antibonding orbitals. The metal contribution is the sum of the metal characters of these five orbitals:\n$$\n\\rho_M^f = 3 \\cdot |c_{d,t,f}|^2 + 2 \\cdot |c_{d,e,f}|^2\n$$\nThe predicted ligand-field splitting $\\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^f$ is defined as the energy difference between the antibonding states of $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ symmetry:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^f = E_{+,e,f} - E_{+,t,f}\n$$\nFinally, we must quantify the relationship between spin localization and the predicted splitting across the three functional types. This is done by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ between the set of metal spin densities $X = \\{\\rho_M^{\\text{GGA}}, \\rho_M^{\\text{HYB}}, \\rho_M^{\\text{SIC}}\\}$ and the set of predicted splittings $Y = \\{\\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^{\\text{GGA}}, \\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^{\\text{HYB}}, \\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^{\\text{SIC}}\\}$. The formula is provided:\n$$\nr \\;=\\; \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(x_i - \\bar{x}\\right)\\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(x_i - \\bar{x}\\right)^2} \\; \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)^2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the sample means. If the variance of either set is zero, the denominator becomes zero, in which case $r$ is defined to be $0$.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by iterating through each test case, then through each of the three functional types to calculate $|c_{d,s,f}|^2$ and $E_{+,s,f}$ for both symmetries. These intermediate results are then used to compute the final observables $\\rho_M^f$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{pred}}^f$. The correlation coefficient $r$ is computed once per test case from the triplets of these observables.
