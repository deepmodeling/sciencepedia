The number of independent transition pathways is given by the multiplicity of $A_{1}$ in this product, which we denote $m_{\\Gamma_{T}}$.\n\nA more direct method is to use the property that the multiplicity of $A_1$ in $\\Gamma_f \\otimes \\Gamma_T \\otimes \\Gamma_i$ is equal to the multiplicity of $\\Gamma_f$ in the product $\\Gamma_T \\otimes \\Gamma_i$.

The process involves constructing reducible representations for the given basis sets, decomposing them into irreducible representations (irreps), and then applying the infrared (IR) selection rules.\n\nFirst, we construct the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{in}}$ spanned by the three in-plane bond-direction vectors $\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}, \\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}$. The character $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(g)$ for each symmetry operation $g$ is the trace of the matrix representing the transformation of these basis vectors. This trace is equivalent to the number of basis vectors that are left unshifted by the operation.\n\nLet us analyze the effect of each class of symmetry operation:\n- $E$: The identity operation leaves all three vectors $\\{\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\mathbf{v}_{2}, \\mathbf{v}_{3}\\}$ unchanged. Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(E) = 3$.\n- $C_{3}$: A rotation by $120^{\\circ}$ about the principal axis cyclically permutes the three vectors ($\\mathbf{v}_{1} \\to \\mathbf{v}_{2}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{2} \\to \\mathbf{v}_{3}$, $\\mathbf{v}_{3} \\to \\mathbf{v}_{1}$). Since all vectors are moved to a different position, no vector contributes to the trace. Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(C_{3}) = 0$.\n- $C_{2}'$: A rotation by $180^{\\circ}$ about an axis passing through one of the $\\mathrm{X}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{Y}$ bonds (e.g., along $\\mathbf{v}_{1}$) leaves that vector unchanged but interchanges the other two. Therefore, one vector remains in place. Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(C_{2}') = 1$.\n- $\\sigma_{h}$: Reflection in the horizontal plane containing the molecule leaves all three in-plane vectors unchanged. Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\sigma_{h}) = 3$.\n- $S_{3}$: An improper rotation by $120^{\\circ}$ involves a $C_{3}$ rotation followed by a $\\sigma_{h}$ reflection. The $C_{3}$ part moves all vectors. The subsequent reflection does not return them to their original positions. Thus, all vectors are shifted. Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(S_{3}) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}$: Reflection in a vertical plane containing the principal axis and one $\\mathrm{X}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{Y}$ bond (e.g., containing $\\mathbf{v}_{1}$) leaves that vector unchanged and interchanges the other two. Thus, one vector remains in place. Thus, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\sigma_{v}) = 1$.\n\nThe character vector for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is therefore $\\chi_{\\mathrm{in}} = (3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1)$.\n\nNext, we construct the representation $\\Gamma_{\\perp}$ spanned by the out-of-plane unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$.\n- $E$: Leaves $\\mathbf{n}$ unchanged. $\\chi_{\\perp}(E) = 1$.\n- $C_{3}$: The vector $\\mathbf{n}$ lies on the axis of rotation, so it is unchanged. $\\chi_{\\perp}(C_{3}) = 1$.\n- $C_{2}'$: The axis of rotation is in the molecular plane, perpendicular to $\\mathbf{n}$. This operation reverses the direction of $\\mathbf{n}$. $\\mathbf{n} \\to -\\mathbf{n}$. Thus, $\\chi_{\\perp}(C_{2}') = -1$.\n- $\\sigma_{h}$: Reflection in the molecular plane, which is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{n}$, reverses its direction. $\\mathbf{n} \\to -\\mathbf{n}$. Thus, $\\chi_{\\perp}(\\sigma_{h}) = -1$.\n- $S_{3}$: The $C_{3}$ operation leaves $\\mathbf{n}$ unchanged, and the subsequent $\\sigma_{h}$ reflection reverses it. $\\mathbf{n} \\to -\\mathbf{n}$. Thus, $\\chi_{\\perp}(S_{3}) = -1$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}$: The vector $\\mathbf{n}$ lies in the plane of reflection, so it is unchanged. $\\chi_{\\perp}(\\sigma_{v}) = 1$.\n\nThe character vector for $\\Gamma_{\\perp}$ is $\\chi_{\\perp} = (1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1)$. By inspection of the provided character table, this matches the characters of the irreducible representation $A_{2}''$.

The problem states that the Cartesian components $(x, y)$ transform as the $E'$ irrep, and the $z$ component transforms as the $A_{2}''$ irrep.\n\nWe examine the irreps in our total representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n- $A_{1}'$: Does not transform as $E'$ or $A_{2}''$. This mode is IR-inactive.\n- $E'$: Transforms as $(x, y)$. This mode is IR-active.\n- $A_{2}''$: Transforms as $z$. This mode is IR-active.\n\nThe final step is to compute the total number $N$ of IR-active normal-mode coordinates. This is the sum of the dimensionalities of the IR-active irreps.

Here, $\\Gamma_{i}=E$, $\\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})=T_{2}$, and $\\Gamma_{f}=T_{2}$. The number $N$ equals the multiplicity of $A_{1}$ in the triple product $E\\otimes T_{2}\\otimes T_{2}$.\n\nTo obtain $N$, we use characters. The character of a product representation on any class is the product of the characters:\n$$\n\\chi_{E\\otimes T_{2}\\otimes T_{2}}(g) \\;=\\; \\chi_{E}(g)\\,\\chi_{T_{2}}(g)\\,\\chi_{T_{2}}(g) \\;=\\; \\chi_{E}(g)\\,\\big[\\chi_{T_{2}}(g)\\big]^{2}.\n$$\nUsing the provided characters on the classes $(E,\\,8C_{3},\\,3C_{2},\\,6S_{4},\\,6\\sigma_{d})$,\n- $\\chi_{E}=(2,\\,-1,\\,2,\\,0,\\,0)$,\n- $\\chi_{T_{2}}=(3,\\,0,\\,-1,\\,-1,\\,1)$,\nwe first compute $\\big[\\chi_{T_{2}}\\big]^{2}$ componentwise:\n$$\n\\big[\\chi_{T_{2}}\\big]^{2} \\;=\\; (3^{2},\\,0^{2},\\,(-1)^{2},\\,(-1)^{2},\\,1^{2}) \\;=\\; (9,\\,0,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1).\n$$\nThen\n$$\n\\chi_{E\\otimes T_{2}\\otimes T_{2}} \\;=\\; \\chi_{E}\\cdot \\big[\\chi_{T_{2}}\\big]^{2} \\;=\\; (2,\\, -1,\\, 2,\\, 0,\\, 0)\\cdot(9,\\, 0,\\, 1,\\, 1,\\, 1) \\;=\\; (18,\\, 0,\\, 2,\\, 0,\\, 0).\n$$\nThe multiplicity $n_{A_{1}}$ of $A_{1}$ in this product is obtained by the standard projection formula\n$$\nn_{A_{1}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{\\text{classes}} n_{c}\\,\\chi_{A_{1}}^{*}(c)\\,\\chi_{E\\otimes T_{2}\\otimes T_{2}}(c),\n$$\nwhere $h=24$ is the group order and $n_{c}$ is the number of elements in each class. Using $\\chi_{A_{1}}=(1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1,\\,1)$ and the class sizes $(1,\\,8,\\,3,\\,6,\\,6)$, we obtain\n$$\nn_{A_{1}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{24}\\left[1\\cdot 1\\cdot 18 \\;+\\; 8\\cdot 1\\cdot 0 \\;+\\; 3\\cdot 1\\cdot 2 \\;+\\; 6\\cdot 1\\cdot 0 \\;+\\; 6\\cdot 1\\cdot 0\\right]\n\\;=\\; \\frac{1}{24}\\left(18+0+6+0+0\\right)\n\\;=\\; \\frac{24}{24}\n\\;=\\; 1.\n$$\nTherefore $N=1$. Physically, there is exactly one linearly independent, symmetry-allowed electric-dipole $d\\to d$ transition from $E$ to $T_{2}$ in $T_{d}$.\n\nThis result is consistent with the conceptual conclusion: in a centrosymmetric environment the parity-based (Laporte) rule forbids $d\\to d$, but in noncentrosymmetric $T_{d}$ the parity rule is inapplicable and the $E\\to T_{2}$ transition is symmetry-allowed, with a single independent transition moment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2928855"}]}
