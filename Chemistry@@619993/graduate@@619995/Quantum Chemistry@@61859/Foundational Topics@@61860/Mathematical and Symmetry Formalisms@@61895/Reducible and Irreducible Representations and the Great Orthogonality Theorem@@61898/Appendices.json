It constitutes a standard exercise in the application of group theory to molecular vibrations. A unique solution exists based on the provided data and established principles of quantum chemistry and group theory. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step derivation of the vibrational modes of the water molecule, which belongs to the $C_{2v}$ point group. The total number of atoms is $N=3$, so the total number of degrees of freedom is $3N=9$. The operations of the $C_{2v}$ group are $\\{E, C_{2}(z), \\sigma_{v}(xz), \\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\}$, and the order of the group is $h=4$.

This character is non-zero only for atoms that are not moved by the operation $R$. The total character is the product of the number of unmoved atoms, $U(R)$, and the character of the $3 \\times 3$ transformation matrix for the Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ on a single unmoved atom, $\\chi_{\\text{atom}}(R)$.\n$$ \\chi_{3N}(R) = U(R) \\cdot \\chi_{\\text{atom}}(R) $$\nWe analyze each operation in the $C_{2v}$ group for the water molecule:\n\nFor the identity operation $E$, all $3$ atoms are unmoved, so $U(E)=3$. The transformation is $(x, y, z) \\to (x, y, z)$. The transformation matrix is the identity matrix $I_3$.\n$$ M(E) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe trace is $\\chi_{\\text{atom}}(E) = 1+1+1=3$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(E) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nFor the $C_2(z)$ rotation, the axis passes only through the oxygen atom. The two hydrogen atoms are interchanged. Thus, only $1$ atom is unmoved, $U(C_2)=1$. The transformation is $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, z)$.\n$$ M(C_2(z)) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe trace is $\\chi_{\\text{atom}}(C_2(z)) = -1-1+1=-1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_2(z)) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n\nFor the $\\sigma_v(xz)$ reflection, the plane contains the $z$-axis and bisects the H-O-H angle. It contains only the oxygen atom, while the hydrogen atoms are interchanged. Thus, $U(\\sigma_v(xz)) = 1$. The transformation is $(x, y, z) \\to (x, -y, z)$.\n$$ M(\\sigma_v(xz)) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe trace is $\\chi_{\\text{atom}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = 1-1+1=1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nFor the $\\sigma_v'(yz)$ reflection, the plane is the molecular plane itself, containing all three atoms. Therefore, $U(\\sigma_v'(yz))=3$. The transformation is $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, y, z)$.\n$$ M(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe trace is $\\chi_{\\text{atom}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = -1+1+1=1$.

The character of the translational representation, $\\chi_{\\text{trans}}(R)$, is therefore the trace of the same $3 \\times 3$ matrices calculated above, i.e., $\\chi_{\\text{trans}}(R) = \\chi_{\\text{atom}}(R)$.\n$\\chi_{\\text{trans}}(E) = 3$\n$\\chi_{\\text{trans}}(C_2(z)) = -1$\n$\\chi_{\\text{trans}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = 1$\n$\\chi_{\\text{trans}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = 1$\nThe set of characters is $\\chi_{\\text{trans}} = (3, -1, 1, 1)$.\n\nThe three rotational modes ($R_x, R_y, R_z$) transform as an axial vector. An axial vector transforms as a polar vector for proper rotations (like $E$ and $C_n$) but acquires an additional factor of $-1$ for improper rotations (like $\\sigma$, $i$, $S_n$). The character for the rotational representation is $\\chi_{\\text{rot}}(R) = \\det(M(R)) \\cdot \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(R)$.\nFor a proper rotation, $\\det(M(R))=1$. For an improper rotation, $\\det(M(R))=-1$.\n\n$E$: proper rotation. $\\chi_{\\text{rot}}(E) = 1 \\times \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(E) = 3$.\n$C_2(z)$: proper rotation. $\\chi_{\\text{rot}}(C_2(z)) = 1 \\times \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(C_2(z)) = -1$.\n$\\sigma_v(xz)$: improper rotation. $\\chi_{\\text{rot}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = -1 \\times \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = -1 \\times 1 = -1$.\n$\\sigma_v'(yz)$: improper rotation. $\\chi_{\\text{rot}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = -1 \\times \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = -1 \\times 1 = -1$.\nThe set of characters is $\\chi_{\\text{rot}} = (3, -1, -1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characters of the vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$**\n\nThe vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$ is obtained by subtracting the translational and rotational representations from the total representation: $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} - \\Gamma_{\\text{rot}}$. The characters are found by subtracting the character sets:\n$\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(E) = \\chi_{3N}(E) - \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(E) - \\chi_{\\text{rot}}(E) = 9 - 3 - 3 = 3$.\n$\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(C_2(z)) = \\chi_{3N}(C_2(z)) - \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(C_2(z)) - \\chi_{\\text{rot}}(C_2(z)) = -1 - (-1) - (-1) = 1$.\n$\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = \\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v(xz)) - \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) - \\chi_{\\text{rot}}(\\sigma_v(xz)) = 1 - 1 - (-1) = 1$.\n$\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = \\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) - \\chi_{\\text{trans}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) - \\chi_{\\text{rot}}(\\sigma_v'(yz)) = 3 - 1 - (-1) = 3$.\nThe set of characters for the vibrational representation is $\\chi_{\\text{vib}} = (3, 1, 1, 3)$. The dimension of this representation is $\\chi_{\\text{vib}}(E)=3$, which corresponds to the expected $3N-6 = 3(3)-6 = 3$ vibrational modes for a non-linear molecule.\n\n**Step 4: Reduction of $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$**\n\nTo reduce $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$, we use the reduction formula derived from the Great Orthogonality Theorem. The number of times an irreducible representation (irrep) $\\Gamma_i$ is contained in $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$ is given by the multiplicity $a_i$:\n$$ a_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{\\text{vib}}(R) $$\nHere, $h=4$ is the order of the group, and $\\chi_i(R)$ are the characters of the irreps of $C_{2v}$.
