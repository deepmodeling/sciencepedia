We shall approach this systematically using the fundamental principles of group theory, specifically the great orthogonality theorem and its consequences.\n\nThe point group is $D_{3d}$, with order $h=12$. The group has $6$ conjugacy classes, and thus must have $6$ irreducible representations (irreps). The classes and their orders are $E$ (size $1$), $2C_{3}$ (size $2$), $3C_{2}^{\\prime}$ (size $3$), $i$ (size $1$), $2S_{6}$ (size $2$), and $3\\sigma_{d}$ (size $3$).\n\nLet $\\chi_i(R)$ be the character of the operation $R$ in the $i$-th irrep. The orthogonality theorem for characters states:\n$$ \\sum_{R \\in G} \\chi_i(R) \\left[ \\chi_j(R) \\right]^* = h \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere the sum is over all $12$ group operations. In terms of classes, this is written as:\n$$ \\sum_k n_k \\chi_i(C_k) \\left[ \\chi_j(C_k) \\right]^* = h \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $n_k$ is the number of operations in class $C_k$.\n\nFirst, we determine the dimensions of the two missing irreps. The dimensions $d_i = \\chi_i(E)$ of the irreps must satisfy the relation $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} d_i^2 = h$.\nThe dimensions of the four given irreps, $A_{1g}$, $E_{g}$, $A_{1u}$, and $A_{2u}$, are $d_1=1$, $d_2=2$, $d_3=1$, and $d_4=1$, respectively.\nThe sum of squares for these is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7 $$\nThe sum of squares of the dimensions of the two missing irreps, let's call them $\\Gamma_5$ and $\\Gamma_6$ with dimensions $d_5$ and $d_6$, must be:\n$$ d_5^2 + d_6^2 = h - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 $$\nThe only integer solution for $d_5$ and $d_6$ is $\\{1, 2\\}$. Therefore, one missing irrep is one-dimensional ($d_5=1$) and the other is two-dimensional ($d_6=2$).\n\nLet us now find the characters of the one-dimensional irrep, $\\Gamma_5$. From the given information, we have four irreps: two are gerade ($g$, character under inversion $i$ is $+d_i$) and two are ungerade ($u$, character under inversion $i$ is $-d_i$). The basis functions $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$ are given to transform as a sum of a 1D gerade irrep and a 2D gerade irrep. The known gerade irreps are $A_{1g}$ (1D) and $E_g$ (2D). This implies the existence of another 1D gerade irrep, which must be our missing $\\Gamma_5$. Let us label it $A_{2g}$.\nAs a gerade irrep, its character under inversion, $\\chi_{A_{2g}}(i)$, must be positive. For a 1D irrep, $\\chi(i)=1$. Also, by convention, 'A' irreps have a character of $+1$ for the principal rotation axis, $C_3$. So, the partial character vector for $A_{2g}$ is $(1, 1, \\chi_3, 1, \\chi_5, \\chi_6)$.\nWe apply orthogonality with the known $E_g$ irrep:\n$$ \\sum_k n_k \\chi_{A_{2g}}(C_k) \\chi_{E_g}(C_k) = 0 $$\n$$ 1(1)(2) + 2(1)(-1) + 3(\\chi_3)(0) + 1(1)(2) + 2(\\chi_5)(-1) + 3(\\chi_6)(0) = 0 $$\n$$ 2 - 2 + 0 + 2 - 2\\chi_5 + 0 = 0 \\implies 2 - 2\\chi_5 = 0 \\implies \\chi_5 = 1 $$\nSo, the character for the $S_6$ operation is $1$.\nNow we apply orthogonality with $A_{1g}$:\n$$ \\sum_k n_k \\chi_{A_{2g}}(C_k) \\chi_{A_{1g}}(C_k) = 0 $$\n$$ 1(1)(1) + 2(1)(1) + 3(\\chi_3)(1) + 1(1)(1) + 2(1)(1) + 3(\\chi_6)(1) = 0 $$\n$$ 1 + 2 + 3\\chi_3 + 1 + 2 + 3\\chi_6 = 0 \\implies 6 + 3\\chi_3 + 3\\chi_6 = 0 \\implies \\chi_3 + \\chi_6 = -2 $$\nThe operations $C_2'$ and $\\sigma_d$ are of order $2$, so their characters in a one-dimensional representation must be $\\pm 1$. The only solution to $\\chi_3 + \\chi_6 = -2$ is $\\chi_3=-1$ and $\\chi_6=-1$.\nThus, the characters for the $A_{2g}$ irrep are $(1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1)$.\n\nNext, we find the characters of the two-dimensional irrep, $\\Gamma_6$. The problem states that $(x,y)$ spans a 2D ungerade irrep. This must be $\\Gamma_6$, which we label $E_u$.\nBeing ungerade, its character under inversion $i$ is negative. The transformation is $(x,y) \\to (-x,-y)$, represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the character $\\chi_{E_u}(i)$ is the trace, which is $-2$.\nThe character vector for $E_u$ is $(2, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, -2, \\chi_5, \\chi_6)$.\nWe can determine the characters directly from the transformation of the basis functions $(x,y)$. The $z$-axis is the principal axis.\n- For $C_3$ rotation by $\\phi = 2\\pi/3$: The transformation matrix has trace $2\\cos(2\\pi/3) = 2(-1/2) = -1$. So, $\\chi_2 = -1$.\n- For $C_2'$ rotation: Let the $C_2'$ axis be the $x$-axis. The transformation is $(x,y) \\to (x,-y)$, with matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The trace is $0$. So, $\\chi_3 = 0$.\n- For $S_6$ operation (rotation by $\\pi/3$ followed by reflection through the $xy$-plane): The transformation of $(x,y)$ is just rotation by $\\pi/3$. The character is the trace of the rotation matrix, $2\\cos(\\pi/3) = 2(1/2) = 1$. So, $\\chi_5 = 1$.\n- For $\\sigma_d$ reflection: A dihedral plane $\\sigma_d$ contains the $z$-axis and bisects the angle between two $C_2'$ axes. Let one $C_2'$ axis be the $x$-axis. The next is at $120^\\circ$. The $\\sigma_d$ plane is at $60^\\circ$ to the $x$-axis. Reflection of a vector $(x,y)$ across a line at angle $\\theta$ results in a transformation matrix with trace $0$. Thus, $\\chi_6 = 0$.\nThe characters for the $E_u$ irrep are therefore $(2, -1, 0, -2, 1, 0)$.\n\nLet's complete the character table to verify consistency.\nClasses: $E, \\; 2C_{3}, \\; 3C_{2}^{\\prime}, \\; i, \\; 2S_{6}, \\; 3\\sigma_{d}$\n$A_{1g}$: $(1, \\; 1, \\; 1, \\; 1, \\; 1, \\; 1)$\n$A_{2g}$: $(1, \\; 1, \\; -1, \\; 1, \\; 1, \\; -1)$\n$E_{g}$: $(2, \\; -1, \\; 0, \\; 2, \\; -1, \\; 0)$\n$A_{1u}$: $(1, \\; 1, \\; 1, \\; -1, \\; -1, \\; -1)$\n$A_{2u}$: $(1, \\; 1, \\; -1, \\; -1, \\; -1, \\; 1)$\n$E_{u}$: $(2, \\; -1, \\; 0, \\; -2, \\; 1, \\; 0)$\n\nThe problem asks for the character of the two-dimensional ungerade irrep for the class $2S_{6}$.\nThe two-dimensional ungerade irrep is $E_u$.\nThe class is $2S_6$.\nFrom the derived character table, the character $\\chi_{E_u}(S_6)$ is the fifth value in the character vector for $E_u$.\nThis value is $1$.\nAll steps are consistent with the principles of group theory and the information provided.\nThe final answer is the numerical value of this character.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2920926"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of how character tables are constructed and what their entries signify, we can now apply this powerful tool to a core problem in quantum chemistry: understanding molecular vibrations.

We use the standard character table for $D_{3h}$.\n\nThe $D_{3h}$ character table is:\n| $D_{3h}$ | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3C_2'$ | $\\sigma_h$ | $2S_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ |\n| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| $A_1'$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $A_2'$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $E'$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ |\n| $A_1''$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ |\n| $A_2''$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |\n| $E''$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $-2$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\nNow, we calculate the multiplicities for the `prime` irreps, as `double prime` irreps are antisymmetric with respect to $\\sigma_h$, and our $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(\\sigma_h) = 3$ suggests `prime` character.\n\nMultiplicity of $A_1'$ ($m_{A_1'}$):\n$$m_{A_1'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ (1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1) + (1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1) ]$$\n$$m_{A_1'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ 3 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 3 ] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\n\nMultiplicity of $E'$ ($m_{E'}$):\n$$m_{E'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ (1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0) + (1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0) ]$$\n$$m_{E'} = \\frac{1}{12} [ 6 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 ] = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$$\n\nThe total dimension of the representation must be conserved. The dimension of $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ is $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(E) = 3$. The sum of the dimensions of the irreps found is $m_{A_1'} \\cdot \\dim(A_1') + m_{E'} \\cdot \\dim(E') = (1)(1) + (1)(2) = 1+2=3$. This matches the dimension of $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$, so the reduction is complete.\n\nTherefore, the reducible representation for the bond stretches decomposes as:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}} = A_1' \\oplus E'\n$$\n\nThe multiplicities are $m_{A_1'} = 1$ and $m_{E'} = 1$.\n\n**Part 3: Infrared Activity of Bond-Stretching Modes**\n\nA vibrational mode is infrared (IR) active if its irreducible representation has the same symmetry (transforms in the same way) as at least one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. The dipole moment vector components transform as these coordinates.\nFrom the problem statement and the $D_{3h}$ character table, the transformation properties are:\n- $(x, y)$ transform as the $E'$ irreducible representation.\n- $z$ transforms as the $A_2''$ irreducible representation.\n\nThe stretching modes we identified have symmetries $A_1'$ and $E'$. We check each for IR activity:\n\n- **$A_1'$ mode**: The $A_1'$ irrep does not match $E'$ or $A_2''$. Therefore, the $A_1'$ stretching mode is **IR-inactive**. This mode corresponds to the symmetric stretch where all three bonds elongate and compress in phase.\n\n- **$E'$ mode**: The $E'$ irrep matches the transformation property of the $(x, y)$ coordinates. Therefore, the $E'$ stretching mode is **IR-active**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of IR-active bond-stretching modes, $N_{\\text{IR-stretch}}$. The $E'$ representation is doubly degenerate, meaning it corresponds to a pair of two distinct normal modes that have the same vibrational frequency. These two modes correspond to asymmetric stretches that generate an oscillating dipole moment in the $xy$-plane. Therefore, there are two IR-active bond-stretching modes.\n\n$$N_{\\text{IR-stretch}} = 2$$\n\nTo summarize the final numerical results requested:\n- Multiplicity of $A_1'$: $m_{A_1'} = 1$.\n- Multiplicity of $E'$: $m_{E'} = 1$.\n- Total number of IR-active bond-stretch modes: $N_{\\text{IR-stretch}} = 2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2920998"}]}
