Subsequently, the order $h$ of each point group must be determined. The final task is to compute the sum $S$ of these orders. The analysis proceeds systematically for each molecule.\n\n1.  **Phosphorus Pentafluoride ($PF_5$)**\n    - **Geometry**: The central phosphorus atom ($P$) has $5$ valence electrons, forming $5$ single bonds with fluorine atoms ($F$). With $5$ bonding pairs and no lone pairs, VSEPR theory predicts a **trigonal bipyramidal** geometry. There are two axial $F$ atoms and three equatorial $F$ atoms.\n    - **Symmetry Elements & Point Group**: The molecule has a principal $C_3$ axis passing through the two axial $F$ atoms and the central $P$ atom. There are three $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis, each passing through the $P$ atom and one equatorial $F$ atom. The presence of a $C_n$ axis and $n$ perpendicular $C_2$ axes defines a dihedral group, $D_n$. For $PF_5$, this is a $D_3$ group. Furthermore, there is a horizontal mirror plane, $\\sigma_h$, which is the equatorial plane containing the $P$ atom and the three equatorial $F$ atoms. The addition of a $\\sigma_h$ plane to a $D_n$ group defines the point group as $D_{nh}$. Thus, the point group for $PF_5$ is **$D_{3h}$**. This group also implies the existence of three vertical mirror planes ($\\sigma_v$) and an $S_3$ improper rotation axis.\n    - **Order $h(PF_5)$**: The order of a $D_{nh}$ group is $4n$. For $D_{3h}$, where $n=3$, the order is $h(PF_5) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$. The operations are $E$, $2C_3$, $3C_2$, $\\sigma_h$, $2S_3$, and $3\\sigma_v$. The sum is $1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 12$.\n\n2.  **Sulfur Hexafluoride ($SF_6$)**\n    - **Geometry**: The central sulfur atom ($S$) has $6$ valence electrons, all participating in $6$ single bonds with fluorine atoms ($F$). With $6$ bonding pairs and no lone pairs, VSEPR theory predicts a perfectly **octahedral** geometry.\n    - **Symmetry Elements & Point Group**: This is another highly symmetric molecule belonging to the cubic groups. It possesses three $C_4$ axes, four $C_3$ axes, and six $C_2$ axes, characteristic of the octahedral rotational group $O$. Crucially, the molecule also contains a center of inversion, $i$, at the position of the $S$ atom. The presence of an inversion center in addition to the rotational symmetries of the octahedron defines the full octahedral point group, **$O_h$**. The notation $O_h$ is equivalent to $O \\times C_i$, meaning the group contains all operations of $O$ plus those generated by combining them with inversion. Other elements include multiple mirror planes ($3\\sigma_h$, $6\\sigma_d$) and improper rotation axes ($6S_4$, $8S_6$).\n    - **Order $h(SF_6)$**: The order of the $O_h$ point group is $48$. This can be found by summing the operations in all its classes: $E$, $8C_3$, $6C_2'$, $6C_4$, $3C_2(=C_4^2)$, $i$, $6S_4$, $8S_6$, $3\\sigma_h$, and $6\\sigma_d$. The total count is $h(SF_6) = 1 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 48$.\n\n3.  **Ammonia ($NH_3$)**\n    - **Geometry**: The central nitrogen atom ($N$) has $5$ valence electrons. It forms $3$ single bonds with hydrogen atoms ($H$) and has one lone pair of electrons. According to VSEPR theory, the $4$ electron domains arrange tetrahedrally, resulting in a **trigonal pyramidal** molecular geometry for $NH_3$.\n    - **Symmetry Elements & Point Group**: The molecule possesses a principal axis of rotation, $C_3$, passing through the $N$ atom and the centroid of the triangular base of $H$ atoms. There are no $C_2$ axes perpendicular to this $C_3$ axis. There are three vertical mirror planes, $\\sigma_v$, each containing the $C_3$ axis and one $N-H$ bond. The presence of a $C_n$ axis and $n$ $\\sigma_v$ planes, with no horizontal plane $\\sigma_h$, defines the point group as $C_{nv}$. For $NH_3$, $n=3$, so the point group is **$C_{3v}$**.\n    - **Order $h(NH_3)$**: The symmetry operations for the $C_{3v}$ group are the identity ($E$), two rotations ($C_3^1$, $C_3^2$), and three reflections in the vertical planes ($3\\sigma_v$). The total number of distinct operations, which is the order of the group, is $h(NH_3) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.\n\n4.  **Methane ($CH_4$)**\n    - **Geometry**: The central carbon atom ($C$) has $4$ valence electrons, all of which are used to form $4$ single bonds with hydrogen atoms ($H$). With $4$ bonding pairs and no lone pairs, VSEPR theory predicts a perfectly **tetrahedral** geometry. The $C$ atom is at the center of the tetrahedron, and the $H$ atoms are at the vertices.\n    - **Symmetry Elements & Point Group**: This highly symmetric molecule possesses multiple, non-collinear, higher-order rotation axes. Specifically, it has four $C_3$ axes (one along each $C-H$ bond) and three $C_2$ axes (bisecting opposite $H-C-H$ angles). These are characteristic of the tetrahedral rotational group, $T$. In addition, methane has six dihedral mirror planes, $\\sigma_d$, each containing the $C$ atom and two $H$ atoms. The presence of these $\\sigma_d$ planes in a tetrahedral framework defines the point group as **$T_d$**. The molecule also contains three $S_4$ improper rotation axes, which are collinear with the $C_2$ axes.\n    - **Order $h(CH_4)$**: The $T_d$ group includes the following operations: the identity ($E$), eight $C_3$ rotations ($8C_3$), three $C_2$ rotations ($3C_2$), six $S_4$ improper rotations ($6S_4$), and six $\\sigma_d$ reflections ($6\\sigma_d$). The order is the sum of these operations: $h(CH_4) = 1 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 24$.\n\n**Calculation of the Sum S**\n\nThe orders of the point groups for the four molecules have been determined as:\n- $h(PF_5) = 12$\n- $h(SF_6) = 48$\n- $h(NH_3) = 6$\n- $h(CH_4) = 24$\n\nThe total sum $S$ is calculated as follows:\n$$\nS = h(PF_5) + h(SF_6) + h(NH_3) + h(CH_4)\n$$\n$$\nS = 12 + 48 + 6 + 24\n$$\n$$\nS = 60 + 30\n$$\n$$\nS = 90\n$$\nThe value of $S$ is a dimensionless integer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{90}\n$$", "id": "2906281"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply classifying molecules, group theory provides a rigorous framework for predicting their physical and chemical properties.

The molecule is achiral. The operation $S_4$ about $z$ is the composition of $C_4$ by angle $\\pi/2$ with the reflection $\\sigma_h$ in the $xy$-plane, so on coordinates $(x,y,z)$ it acts as $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-y,x,-z)$.

Because $S_4$ is a symmetry of the molecule, this orientation-reversed image is superposable on the original, so the molecule equals its mirror image.\n\nB. The molecule is chiral. Although it has $S_4$, it lacks a mirror plane $\\sigma$ and an inversion center $i$, and only $\\sigma$ or $i$ guarantee achirality; $S_4$ alone is insufficient.\n\nC. The molecule’s chirality depends on the parity of $n$ in $S_n$: only $S_n$ with even $n$ make molecules achiral. Thus $S_4$ molecules are achiral, but $S_3$ molecules would be chiral.\n\nD. The molecule is chiral unless it also has a $C_2$ axis perpendicular to the $S_4$ axis; only with such an additional $C_2$ is the mirror image superposable, so $S_4$ alone does not determine achirality.", "solution": "A molecule is defined as achiral if it is superposable on its mirror image by an orientation-preserving motion (a proper rotation). The necessary and sufficient condition for a molecule to be achiral is that its point group contains at least one orientation-reversing symmetry operation, i.e., an improper rotation $S_n$ (this includes a plane of symmetry, $\\sigma = S_1$, and a center of inversion, $i = S_2$).\n\nThe problem states that the molecule belongs to the point group $S_4$. By definition, this point group contains the symmetry operation $S_4$. Since $S_4$ is an improper rotation, the molecule is necessarily achiral.\n\nTo provide the justification requested, we construct the effect of the $S_4$ operation on a right-handed coordinate system.

The handedness of this system is given by the sign of the scalar triple product, $\\mathbf{e}_x \\cdot (\\mathbf{e}_y \\times \\mathbf{e}_z) = +1$. The $S_4$ operation along the $z$-axis is a composition of a proper rotation $C_4$ about the $z$-axis by an angle of $2\\pi/4 = \\pi/2$ radians, followed by a reflection $\\sigma_h$ through the $xy$-plane.
