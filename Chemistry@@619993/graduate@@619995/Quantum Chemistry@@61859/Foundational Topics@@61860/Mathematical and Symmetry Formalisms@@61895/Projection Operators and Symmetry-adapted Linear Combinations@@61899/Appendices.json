All necessary information, including the point group, basis functions, and character table, is provided and is factually correct. The tasks are logically sequenced and lead to a unique, derivable solution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts: first, the determination of the characters of the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s}$; second, the decomposition of this representation into its constituent irreducible representations (irreps); and third, the generation and normalization of the SALC belonging to the $a_1'$ irrep.\n\nFirst, we construct the character set for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s}$ spanned by the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3\\}$. The character $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(R)$ for a symmetry operation $R$ is the number of basis functions that are left in their original position by the action of $\\hat{R}$. We analyze one representative operation from each class of the $D_{3h}$ group. The hydrogen atoms are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle in the $xy$-plane.\n\n-   Class $E$: The identity operation $\\hat{E}$ leaves all three orbitals $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3\\}$ unmoved. Thus, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(E) = 3$.\n-   Class $2C_3$: A rotation by $\\pm 2\\pi/3$ about the $z$-axis (perpendicular to the molecular plane) permutes all three orbitals. No orbital remains in its original position. Thus, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(C_3) = 0$.\n-   Class $3C_2'$: Each of the three $C_2'$ axes passes through one hydrogen atom and the center of the triangle. The rotation leaves this one atom unmoved while permuting the other two. Thus, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(C_2') = 1$.\n-   Class $\\sigma_h$: The horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_h$ is the plane containing the three hydrogen atoms. It leaves all three orbitals in their positions. As a $1s$ orbital is spherically symmetric, it is even with respect to reflection through a plane containing its nucleus. Thus, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(\\sigma_h) = 3$.\n-   Class $2S_3$: The improper rotation $\\hat{S}_3 = \\hat{\\sigma}_h \\hat{C}_3$ involves a rotation that moves all atoms, followed by a reflection that keeps them in their new positions. No orbital is mapped onto itself. Thus, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(S_3) = 0$.\n-   Class $3\\sigma_v$: Each of the three vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_v$ contains one hydrogen atom. This operation leaves that one orbital in place and permutes the other two. Thus, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\n\nThe characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s}$ are therefore $\\{3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1\\}$ for the classes $E, 2C_3, 3C_2', \\sigma_h, 2S_3, 3\\sigma_v$ respectively.\n\nSecond, we decompose $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s}$ into the irreducible representations of $D_{3h}$. The number of times, $n_i$, that an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ is contained in $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s}$ is given by the formula:\n$$n_{i} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{c} g_{c} \\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(c) \\chi_{i}(c)$$\nwhere $h=12$ is the order of the group, $g_c$ is the number of operations in class $c$, $\\chi_{\\text{H}1s}(c)$ is the character of the reducible representation, and $\\chi_{i}(c)$ is the character of the irrep $\\Gamma_i$. The number of elements in the classes are $\\{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n-   For $a_1'$:\n    $n_{a_1'} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(1) + 1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{12}(3+0+3+3+0+3) = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$.\n-   For $a_2'$:\n    $n_{a_2'} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(-1) + 1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{12}(3+0-3+3+0-3) = 0$.\n-   For $e'$:\n    $n_{e'} = \\frac{1}{12} [1(3)(2) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(1)(0) + 1(3)(2) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{12}(6+0+0+6+0+0) = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$.\nThe remaining irreps ($a_1''$, $a_2''$, $e''$) are likewise found to be absent. The decomposition is $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s} = a_1' \\oplus e'$. The sum of dimensions $1+2=3$ matches the dimension of $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}1s}$.\n\nThird, we construct the SALC of $a_1'$ symmetry. The projection operator for an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ is defined as:\n$$\\hat{P}^{(i)} = \\frac{l_{i}}{h} \\sum_{R \\in G} \\chi_{i}(R) \\hat{R}$$\nwhere $l_i$ is the dimension of the irrep. For $a_1'$, $l_{a_1'} = 1$ and all characters $\\chi_{a_1'}(R) = 1$. The operator is proportional to the sum of all symmetry operators in the group:\n$$\\hat{P}^{(a_1')} \\propto \\sum_{R \\in D_{3h}} \\hat{R}$$\nWe apply this operator to one of the basis functions, for example $\\phi_1$, to generate the SALC. We sum the result of applying each of the 12 individual operators in $D_{3h}$ to $\\phi_1$:\n$\\hat{E}\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_1$\n$\\hat{C}_3\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_2$, $\\hat{C}_3^2\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_3$\n$\\hat{C}_{2(1)}'\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_1$, $\\hat{C}_{2(2)}'\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_3$, $\\hat{C}_{2(3)}'\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_2$\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_h\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_1$\n$\\hat{S}_3\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_2$, $\\hat{S}_3^5\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_3$\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(1)}\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_1$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(2)}\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_3$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v(3)}\\phi_1 \\rightarrow \\phi_2$\nSumming these gives:\n$(1+1+1+1)\\phi_{1} + (1+1+1+1)\\phi_{2} + (1+1+1+1)\\phi_{3} = 4\\phi_{1} + 4\\phi_{2} + 4\\phi_{3}$.\nThe unnormalized SALC is $\\Psi_{a_{1}^{\\prime}}^{\\text{un-norm}} = \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3}$.\n\nTo normalize this function, we compute the normalization constant $N$ such that $\\langle N \\Psi_{a_{1}^{\\prime}}^{\\text{un-norm}} | N \\Psi_{a_{1}^{\\prime}}^{\\text{un-norm}} \\rangle = 1$. We assume the basis of atomic orbitals is orthonormal, i.e., $\\langle \\phi_{i} | \\phi_{j} \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$.\n$$N^2 \\langle \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3} | \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3} \\rangle = 1$$\n$$N^2 (\\langle \\phi_{1} | \\phi_{1} \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_{2} | \\phi_{2} \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_{3} | \\phi_{3} \\rangle) = 1$$\n$$N^2 (1 + 1 + 1) = 3N^2 = 1 \\implies N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe normalized SALC is $\\Psi_{a_{1}^{\\prime}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{2} + \\phi_{3})$.\nThe coefficients on the ordered basis $(\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}, \\phi_{3})$ are $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$.

This is equivalent to finding the irreducible representations that constitute the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{rep}$ generated by the basis set. The basis set is the orbit of a single trial vector under the group's symmetry operations. For the given geometry, the orbit of any single vector $f_i$ is the set of all four vectors $\\{ f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4 \\}$.\n\nWe must therefore determine the characters of the reducible representations $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\tau}$ spanned by the set of radial vectors $\\{f_{i}^{(\\sigma)}\\}$ and tangential vectors $\\{f_{i}^{(\\tau)}\\}$, respectively.

You may use standard facts about $O_{h}$, such as that $a_{1g}$ is totally symmetric and that $t_{1u}$ transforms like the Cartesian vector $(x,y,z)$, and that inversion parity distinguishes gerade ($g$) from ungerade ($u$) SALCs.\n\nTasks:\n- Build one normalized $a_{1g}$ SALC, two orthonormal $e_{g}$ SALCs, and three orthonormal $t_{1u}$ SALCs, all expressed as real linear combinations of the ordered basis $\\{\\phi_{x+}, \\phi_{x-}, \\phi_{y+}, \\phi_{y-}, \\phi_{z+}, \\phi_{z-}\\}$.\n- Verify mutual orthonormality by computing inner products between distinct SALCs and norms of each SALC using $\\langle \\phi_{i} | \\phi_{j} \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$.\n- Assemble the coefficients into a single $6 \\times 6$ orthogonal transformation matrix $U$ whose rows are, in order, the $a_{1g}$ SALC, the two $e_{g}$ SALCs, and the three $t_{1u}$ SALCs labeled $(t_{1u,x}, t_{1u,y}, t_{1u,z})$.\n\nExpress the final answer as the exact $6 \\times 6$ matrix $U$ with radicals and rational numbers only. No rounding is required, and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It represents a standard application of group theory to quantum chemistry and is therefore valid. I will proceed with the rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of six ligand $\\sigma$-donor functions, $\\{\\phi_{x+}, \\phi_{x-}, \\phi_{y+}, \\phi_{y-}, \\phi_{z+}, \\phi_{z-}\\}$ for an octahedral complex of $O_h$ symmetry. These basis functions are given as normalized and mutually orthogonal, forming a $6$-dimensional representation of the $O_h$ group, which we shall denote $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$. The basis is ordered as $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\phi_4, \\phi_5, \\phi_6\\} \\equiv \\{\\phi_{x+}, \\phi_{x-}, \\phi_{y+}, \\phi_{y-}, \\phi_{z+}, \\phi_{z-}\\}$.\n\nThe first step is to determine the irreducible representations (irreps) contained within $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$. This is accomplished using the reduction formula which involves the characters of $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ and the irreps of $O_h$. The character $\\chi^{(\\Gamma_{\\sigma})}(R)$ for an operation $R$ is the number of basis functions left unchanged by $R$.\nThe characters for $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ are:\n$\\chi(E) = 6$\n$\\chi(C_3) = 0$\n$\\chi(C_2) = 0$\n$\\chi(C_4) = 2$ (functions on the rotation axis are invariant)\n$\\chi(C_2' = C_4^2) = 2$ (functions on the rotation axis are invariant)\n$\\chi(i) = 0$ (all functions are swapped in pairs)\n$\\chi(S_4) = 0$\n$\\chi(S_6) = 0$\n$\\chi(\\sigma_h) = 4$ (functions in the reflection plane are invariant)\n$\\chi(\\sigma_d) = 2$ (functions on the intersection of the reflection plane with coordinate axes are invariant)\n\nThe decomposition of $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ reveals which SALCs can be constructed. Application of the reduction formula $n_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} \\chi^{(\\Gamma)}(R)^* \\chi^{(\\Gamma_{\\sigma})}(R)$ yields the universally established result for this system:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\sigma} = A_{1g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus T_{1u} $$\nThe dimensions of these irreps are $l_{A_{1g}} = 1$, $l_{E_g} = 2$, and $l_{T_{1u}} = 3$. The sum of the dimensions is $1+2+3 = 6$, which matches the dimension of our basis, as required. We will now construct the SALCs for each of these irreps using the projection operator formalism, simplified by physical and symmetry-based arguments. The general projector for an irrep $\\Gamma$ is $\\hat{P}^{(\\Gamma)} = \\frac{l_{\\Gamma}}{h} \\sum_{R} \\chi^{(\\Gamma)}(R)^* \\hat{R}$.\n\n**1. $A_{1g}$ SALC**\nThe $A_{1g}$ irrep is totally symmetric, meaning $\\chi^{(A_{1g})}(R) = 1$ for all $R \\in O_h$. The projection operator (up to a normalization constant) is $\\hat{P}^{(A_{1g})} \\propto \\sum_{R \\in O_h} \\hat{R}$. Applying this to a starting function, for instance $\\phi_{x+}$, generates the sum of all functions in its orbit under the group action. The orbit of any single ligand function is the entire set of six functions.\n$$ \\psi'_{a_{1g}} = \\hat{P}^{(A_{1g})} \\phi_{x+} \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\phi_i = \\phi_{x+} + \\phi_{x-} + \\phi_{y+} + \\phi_{y-} + \\phi_{z+} + \\phi_{z-} $$\nTo normalize, we compute the norm squared:\n$$ \\langle \\psi'_{a_{1g}} | \\psi'_{a_{1g}} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\langle\\phi_i|\\phi_i\\rangle = 6 $$\nThe normalized $a_{1g}$ SALC is therefore:\n$$ \\psi_{a_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} (\\phi_{x+} + \\phi_{x-} + \\phi_{y+} + \\phi_{y-} + \\phi_{z+} + \\phi_{z-}) $$\n\n**2. $T_{1u}$ SALCs**\nThe $T_{1u}$ irrep is $3$-dimensional and ungerade ($u$). This means any $T_{1u}$ SALC must change sign under inversion $i$. The inversion operator swaps $\\phi_{i+}$ and $\\phi_{i-}$. Therefore, combinations of the form $\\phi_{i+} - \\phi_{i-}$ are ungerade and are candidates for building blocks. The problem states that $T_{1u}$ transforms as the Cartesian vector $(x,y,z)$. We can construct three orthogonal SALCs that reflect this transformation property.\nLet's define a SALC that transforms as $x$, which is odd with respect to reflections in the $yz$ plane and even with respect to reflections in the $xy$ and $xz$ planes. A simple choice is:\n$$ \\psi'_{t_{1u},x} = \\phi_{x+} - \\phi_{x-} $$\nIts norm squared is $\\langle \\phi_{x+} - \\phi_{x-} | \\phi_{x+} - \\phi_{x-} \\rangle = 1+1 = 2$. Normalizing gives:\n$$ \\psi_{t_{1u},x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\phi_{x+} - \\phi_{x-}) $$\nBy analogy, for the $y$ and $z$ components:\n$$ \\psi_{t_{1u},y} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\phi_{y+} - \\phi_{y-}) $$\n$$ \\psi_{t_{1u},z} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\phi_{z+} - \\phi_{z-}) $$\nThese three functions are mutually orthogonal due to the orthogonality of the original basis. For example, $\\langle \\psi_{t_{1u},x} | \\psi_{t_{1u},y} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\phi_{x+} - \\phi_{x-} | \\phi_{y+} - \\phi_{y-} \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**3. $E_g$ SALCs**\nThe $E_g$ irrep is $2$-dimensional and gerade ($g$). The SALCs must be invariant under inversion, suggesting combinations of the form $\\phi_{i+} + \\phi_{i-}$. Furthermore, they must be orthogonal to the $A_{1g}$ SALC.\nThe two $E_g$ SALCs are known to have symmetries analogous to the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.\nLet's construct the $d_{z^2}$-like SALC. It should treat the $z$ direction differently from the $x$ and $y$ directions. We propose a linear combination:\n$$ \\psi'_{e_g,1} = c_1(\\phi_{z+}+\\phi_{z-}) + c_2(\\phi_{x+}+\\phi_{x-}) + c_3(\\phi_{y+}+\\phi_{y-}) $$\nDue to symmetry between $x$ and $y$, we must have $c_2=c_3$. Let's set $c_2 = -1$.\nOrthogonality with $\\psi_{a_{1g}}$ requires $\\langle \\psi_{a_{1g}} | \\psi'_{e_g,1} \\rangle = 0$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\langle \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\phi_i | c_1(\\phi_{z+}+\\phi_{z-}) - (\\phi_{x+}+\\phi_{x-}) - (\\phi_{y+}+\\phi_{y-}) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2c_1 - 2 - 2) = 0 $$\nThis gives $2c_1 - 4 = 0$, so $c_1 = 2$. The unnormalized SALC is:\n$$ \\psi'_{e_g,1} = 2(\\phi_{z+}+\\phi_{z-}) - (\\phi_{x+}+\\phi_{x-}) - (\\phi_{y+}+\\phi_{y-}) $$\nIts norm squared is $2^2(1+1) + (-1)^2(1+1) + (-1)^2(1+1) = 8+2+2=12$.\nThe normalized SALC is:\n$$ \\psi_{e_g,1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} (2\\phi_{z+} + 2\\phi_{z-} - \\phi_{x+} - \\phi_{x-} - \\phi_{y+} - \\phi_{y-}) $$\nFor the second $E_g$ SALC, analogous to $d_{x^2-y^2}$, we need a function that treats $x$ and $y$ oppositely.\n$$ \\psi'_{e_g,2} = (\\phi_{x+}+\\phi_{x-}) - (\\phi_{y+}+\\phi_{y-}) $$\nThis function is gerade. It is orthogonal to $\\psi_{a_{1g}}$ because the coefficients sum to zero $(1+1-1-1=0)$. It is also orthogonal to $\\psi_{e_g,1}$:\n$$ \\langle \\psi'_{e_g,1} | \\psi'_{e_g,2} \\rangle \\propto \\langle -(\\phi_{x+}+\\phi_{x-}) - (\\phi_{y+}+\\phi_{y-}) + 2(\\phi_{z+}+\\phi_{z-}) | (\\phi_{x+}+\\phi_{x-}) - (\\phi_{y+}+\\phi_{y-}) \\rangle = -(1+1) - (-1)(1+1) = -2+2=0 $$\nThe norm squared of $\\psi'_{e_g,2}$ is $(1+1) + (-1)^2(1+1) = 4$. The normalized SALC is:\n$$ \\psi_{e_g,2} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi_{x+} + \\phi_{x-} - \\phi_{y+} - \\phi_{y-}) $$\n\n**4. Orthonormality and Transformation Matrix**\nThe set of six SALCs $\\{\\psi_{a_{1g}}, \\psi_{e_g,1}, \\psi_{e_g,2}, \\psi_{t_{1u},x}, \\psi_{t_{1u},y}, \\psi_{t_{1u},z}\\}$ is complete and orthonormal by construction. We can now assemble the $6 \\times 6$ transformation matrix $U$, whose rows are the coefficients of these SALCs in the specified order, relative to the basis $\\{\\phi_{x+}, \\phi_{x-}, \\phi_{y+}, \\phi_{y-}, \\phi_{z+}, \\phi_{z-}\\}$.\n\nRow 1 ($a_{1g}$): $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}]$\nRow 2 ($e_g$, $z^2$-like): $[-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}}, \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{12}}]$\nRow 3 ($e_g$, $x^2-y^2$-like): $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4}}, 0, 0]$\nRow 4 ($t_{1u,x}$): $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0, 0, 0]$\nRow 5 ($t_{1u,y}$): $[0, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0, 0]$\nRow 6 ($t_{1u,z}$): $[0, 0, 0, 0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}]$\n\nAfter simplifying the numerical coefficients, the matrix $U$ is:\n$$\nU = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the required orthogonal transformation matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2917492"}]}
