It is a standard, correct formulation in quantum mechanics. We will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe probability of finding the electron in an infinitesimal volume element $d\\tau$ at position $\\mathbf{r}$ is given by $|\\psi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 d\\tau$. In spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the volume element is $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The probability is thus $dP = |\\psi(r,\\theta,\\phi)|^2 r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$.\n\nThe radial probability density, which we denote $P_{10}(r)$, is defined such that $P_{10}(r)dr$ is the total probability of finding the electron in a thin spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$. To obtain this, we must integrate the probability density $|\\psi_{100}|^2$ over the angular variables $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ and multiply by the volume of the shell, which is approximately $4\\pi r^2 dr$ for infinitesimal $dr$. Formally,\n$$P_{10}(r) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} |\\psi_{100}(r,\\theta,\\phi)|^2 r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$$\n\nThe ground-state wavefunction is given as $\\psi_{100}(r,\\theta,\\phi)=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,a_{0}^{3/2}}\\,\\exp(-r/a_{0})$. Since the wavefunction is real, $|\\psi_{100}|^2 = \\psi_{100}^2$. We compute the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n$$|\\psi_{100}(r,\\theta,\\phi)|^2 = \\left( \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,a_{0}^{3/2}}\\,\\exp(-r/a_{0}) \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\pi a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0})$$\nThis expression is independent of the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, which is characteristic of an $s$-orbital ($l=0$). This simplifies the integral for $P_{10}(r)$:\n$$P_{10}(r) = r^2 \\left( \\dfrac{1}{\\pi a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$$\nThe integral over the solid angle is a standard result:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_{0}^{\\pi} = -(\\cos\\pi - \\cos 0) = -(-1 - 1) = 2$$\nThe total solid angle integral is therefore $(2\\pi)(2) = 4\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $P_{10}(r)$, we obtain the explicit form of the radial probability density for the ground state:\n$$P_{10}(r) = r^2 \\left( \\dfrac{1}{\\pi a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right) (4\\pi)$$\n$$P_{10}(r) = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} r^2 \\exp(-2r/a_{0})$$\nThis is the required explicit form of $P_{10}(r)$.\n\nNext, we must find the most probable radius, $r_{\\mathrm{mp}}$, by finding the value of $r$ for which $P_{10}(r)$ is a maximum. This requires solving the equation $\\dfrac{dP_{10}}{dr}=0$. We compute the derivative of $P_{10}(r)$ with respect to $r$ using the product rule:\n$$\\dfrac{dP_{10}}{dr} = \\dfrac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\left(\\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}}\\right) r^2 \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right]$$\n$$\\dfrac{dP_{10}}{dr} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\left[ \\dfrac{d(r^2)}{dr} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) + r^2 \\dfrac{d}{dr}\\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right]$$\n$$\\dfrac{dP_{10}}{dr} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\left[ 2r \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) + r^2 \\left( -\\dfrac{2}{a_{0}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right) \\right]$$\nSet the derivative to zero to find the critical points:\n$$\\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\left[ 2r \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) - \\dfrac{2r^2}{a_{0}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right] = 0$$\nWe can factor out common terms:\n$$\\dfrac{8r}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{r}{a_{0}} \\right) = 0$$\nThe pre-factor term $\\dfrac{8r}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0})$ is zero only if $r=0$ or $r \\to \\infty$. The term in the parenthesis is zero if $1 - \\dfrac{r}{a_{0}} = 0$. This gives two critical points for $r \\ge 0$: $r=0$ and $r=a_{0}$.\n\nTo determine whether these points correspond to a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection, we must examine the second derivative, $\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2}$. Let us first analyze the behavior of $P_{10}(r)$. At $r=0$, $P_{10}(0)=0$. As $r \\to \\infty$, the exponential term $\\exp(-2r/a_0)$ dominates, and $P_{10}(r) \\to 0$. Since $P_{10}(r)$ is a non-negative function that is zero at both ends of its domain $[0, \\infty)$, the non-zero critical point must correspond to a maximum. For rigor, we compute the second derivative:\n$$\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2} = \\dfrac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\left( 2r - \\dfrac{2r^2}{a_{0}} \\right) \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right]$$\n$$\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\left[ \\left( 2 - \\dfrac{4r}{a_{0}} \\right) \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) + \\left( 2r - \\dfrac{2r^2}{a_{0}} \\right) \\left( -\\dfrac{2}{a_{0}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\left[ 2 - \\dfrac{4r}{a_{0}} - \\dfrac{4r}{a_{0}} + \\dfrac{4r^2}{a_{0}^2} \\right]$$\n$$\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2r/a_{0}) \\left[ 2 - \\dfrac{8r}{a_{0}} + \\dfrac{4r^2}{a_{0}^2} \\right]$$\n\nNow we evaluate at the critical points:\n1.  At $r=0$: $\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=0} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(0) [2-0+0] = \\dfrac{8}{a_{0}^{3}} > 0$. This corresponds to a local minimum.\n2.  At $r=a_{0}$: $\\dfrac{d^2P_{10}}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=a_{0}} = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2) \\left[ 2 - \\dfrac{8a_{0}}{a_{0}} + \\dfrac{4a_{0}^2}{a_{0}^2} \\right] = \\dfrac{4}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2) [2-8+4] = -\\dfrac{8}{a_{0}^{3}} \\exp(-2) < 0$. This corresponds to a local maximum.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the most probable radius for the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom occurs at $r=a_{0}$.

Do not perform any numerical evaluation.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It presents a standard, solvable problem in quantum mechanics concerning the first-order Stark effect in the hydrogen atom. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. First, we must justify the vanishing first-order energy shift for the ground state based on parity. Second, we must compute the first-order energy shifts for the degenerate $n=2$ level using degenerate perturbation theory. Third, we must collect and order all energy corrections for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\nPart 1: First-Order Stark Shift of the Ground State ($n=1$)\n\nThe first-order correction to the energy of a non-degenerate state $|\\psi^{(0)}\\rangle$ due to a perturbation $H'$ is given by the expectation value of the perturbation in the unperturbed state:\n$$E^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi^{(0)} | H' | \\psi^{(0)} \\rangle$$\nFor the hydrogen atom ground state, $|\\psi^{(0)}\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. The perturbation is $H' = e\\mathcal{E}z$, where $z = r\\cos\\theta$. The energy correction is therefore:\n$$E_{100}^{(1)} = \\langle \\Psi_{100} | e\\mathcal{E}z | \\Psi_{100} \\rangle = e\\mathcal{E} \\int \\Psi_{100}^{*}(r,\\theta,\\phi) \\, z \\, \\Psi_{100}(r,\\theta,\\phi) \\, dV$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we will use a fundamental symmetry argument based on parity. The parity operator, $\\Pi$, inverts the spatial coordinates: $\\Pi f(\\mathbf{r}) = f(-\\mathbf{r})$. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to $(r, \\theta, \\phi) \\to (r, \\pi-\\theta, \\phi+\\pi)$. The unperturbed hydrogenic eigenfunctions $\\Psi_{n\\ell m}$ are eigenstates of the parity operator with eigenvalue $(-1)^{\\ell}$:\n$$\\Pi \\Psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\Psi_{n\\ell m}(-\\mathbf{r}) = (-1)^{\\ell} \\Psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r})$$\nThe ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\ell=0$. Thus, its wavefunction $\\Psi_{100}$ is an eigenfunction of parity with eigenvalue $(-1)^0 = +1$. This means the ground state has even parity.\nThe perturbation operator $H' = e\\mathcal{E}z$ has the same parity as the coordinate $z$. Under the parity transformation, $z \\to -z$, so the operator $H'$ has odd parity.\nThe integrand in the expression for $E_{100}^{(1)}$ is $\\Psi_{100}^{*} z \\Psi_{100}$. The parity of this function is the product of the parities of its factors: $(\\text{even}) \\times (\\text{odd}) \\times (\\text{even}) = (\\text{odd})$.\nThe integral of an odd function over a symmetric domain (in this case, all space, which is symmetric under inversion) is identically zero. Therefore, we conclude from first principles:\n$$E_{100}^{(1)} = 0$$\nThis result is justified without invoking any specific selection rules beyond the direct consequences of parity.\n\nPart 2: First-Order Stark Shift of the Degenerate $n=2$ Manifold\n\nThe $n=2$ level of the hydrogen atom is $4$-fold degenerate. The basis of unperturbed states is $\\{|2,0,0\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle\\}$. For degenerate states, first-order perturbation theory requires the diagonalization of the perturbation matrix $W$, with elements given by:\n$$W_{ij} = \\langle \\psi_i^{(0)} | H' | \\psi_j^{(0)} \\rangle$$\nwhere $\\psi_i^{(0)}$ and $\\psi_j^{(0)}$ are the degenerate eigenfunctions. We must construct and diagonalize the $4 \\times 4$ matrix $W$ with $H' = e\\mathcal{E}r\\cos\\theta$ in the specified basis.\n\nWe first analyze which matrix elements can be non-zero. The matrix element is:\n$$W_{\\ell m, \\ell' m'} = \\langle 2, \\ell, m | e\\mathcal{E}r\\cos\\theta | 2, \\ell', m' \\rangle$$\nThe operator $H'$ does not depend on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. The angular part of the integral involving $\\phi$ is $\\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-im\\phi} e^{im'\\phi} d\\phi = 2\\pi\\delta_{mm'}$. This is a selection rule: the matrix element is zero unless $m=m'$.\n\nFurthermore, the parity argument used previously applies to off-diagonal elements as well. The parity of the integrand is $(-1)^{\\ell} \\times (-1) \\times (-1)^{\\ell'} = (-1)^{\\ell+\\ell'+1}$. For the integral to be non-zero, the integrand must be an even function, which requires $\\ell+\\ell'+1$ to be even. This implies that $\\ell+\\ell'$ must be odd, which means that $\\ell$ and $\\ell'$ must have different parity. This gives the selection rule $\\Delta\\ell = |\\ell-\\ell'| = \\text{odd}$.\n\nCombining these two rules ($\\Delta m = 0, \\Delta \\ell = \\text{odd}$), we can determine the structure of the $W$ matrix for the basis ordered as $|2,0,0\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$:\n1.  All diagonal elements $W_{ii}$ are zero because $\\ell=\\ell'$, so $\\Delta\\ell=0$ (even).\n2.  Elements connecting $|2,1,1\\rangle$ or $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ to any other state are zero, because no other state has $m=\\pm 1$.\n3.  The only non-zero elements can be those connecting states with different $\\ell$ and the same $m$. The only such pair in the $n=2$ manifold is $|2,0,0\\rangle$ (with $\\ell=0, m=0$) and $|2,1,0\\rangle$ (with $\\ell=1, m=0$).\n\nThus, the only non-zero matrix elements are $W_{12} = \\langle 2,0,0 | H' | 2,1,0 \\rangle$ and $W_{21} = \\langle 2,1,0 | H' | 2,0,0 \\rangle = W_{12}^{*}$. The perturbation matrix has the form:\n$$W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & W_{12} & 0 & 0 \\\\ W_{21} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe now compute $W_{12}$:\n$$W_{12} = e\\mathcal{E} \\langle 2,0,0 | r\\cos\\theta | 2,1,0 \\rangle = e\\mathcal{E} \\int (\\Psi_{200})^* (r\\cos\\theta) (\\Psi_{210}) dV$$\nThis integral separates into a radial part and an angular part:\n$$W_{12} = e\\mathcal{E} \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r^3 R_{20}(r) R_{21}(r) dr \\right) \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} (Y_{0}^{0})^* \\cos\\theta Y_{1}^{0} \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi \\right)$$\nThe required spherical harmonics are $Y_{0}^{0} = 1/\\sqrt{4\\pi}$ and $Y_{1}^{0}(\\theta,\\phi) = \\sqrt{3/(4\\pi)}\\cos\\theta$.\nThe angular integral is:\n$$I_{\\text{ang}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\phi\\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}} \\cos\\theta \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}}\\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4\\pi} (2\\pi) \\int_0^{\\pi} \\cos^2\\theta \\sin\\theta d\\theta$$\nLet $u=\\cos\\theta$, so $du=-\\sin\\theta d\\theta$. The integral becomes $\\int_{1}^{-1} u^2 (-du) = \\int_{-1}^{1} u^2 du = [\\frac{u^3}{3}]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} - (-\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$I_{\\text{ang}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe radial integral is, using the provided wavefunctions $R_{20}$ and $R_{21}$:\n$$I_{\\text{rad}} = \\int_0^\\infty r^3 \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,a_{0}^{3/2}}\\left(2-\\frac{r}{a_{0}}\\right)e^{-r/2a_{0}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{6}\\,a_{0}^{3/2}}\\left(\\frac{r}{a_{0}}\\right)e^{-r/2a_{0}} \\right) dr$$\n$$I_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{12} a_0^4} \\int_0^\\infty r^4 \\left(2-\\frac{r}{a_0}\\right) e^{-r/a_0} dr = \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{3} a_0^4} \\left( 2\\int_0^\\infty r^4 e^{-r/a_0} dr - \\frac{1}{a_0}\\int_0^\\infty r^5 e^{-r/a_0} dr \\right)$$\nUsing the standard integral $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-kx} dx = n!/k^{n+1}$ with $k=1/a_0$:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty r^4 e^{-r/a_0} dr = \\frac{4!}{(1/a_0)^5} = 24 a_0^5$$\n$$\\int_0^\\infty r^5 e^{-r/a_0} dr = \\frac{5!}{(1/a_0)^6} = 120 a_0^6$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $I_{\\text{rad}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{3} a_0^4} \\left( 2(24 a_0^5) - \\frac{1}{a_0}(120 a_0^6) \\right) = \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{3} a_0^4} (48 a_0^5 - 120 a_0^5) = \\frac{-72 a_0^5}{8\\sqrt{3} a_0^4} = \\frac{-9 a_0}{\\sqrt{3}} = -3\\sqrt{3} a_0$$\nCombining the results:\n$$W_{12} = e\\mathcal{E} \\times I_{\\text{rad}} \\times I_{\\text{ang}} = e\\mathcal{E} (-3\\sqrt{3} a_0) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = -3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$$\nSince $W_{12}$ is real, $W_{21}=W_{12}$. The perturbation matrix is:\n$$W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -3e\\mathcal{E}a_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -3e\\mathcal{E}a_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the first-order energy corrections, $E^{(1)}$. The matrix is block-diagonal. The lower right $2 \\times 2$ block gives two eigenvalues equal to $0$. The upper left $2 \\times 2$ block is $W_{2\\times2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -3e\\mathcal{E}a_0 \\\\ -3e\\mathcal{E}a_0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(W_{2\\times2} - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\\lambda^2 - (-3e\\mathcal{E}a_0)^2 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 = (3e\\mathcal{E}a_0)^2 \\implies \\lambda = \\pm 3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$$\nThus, the four first-order energy corrections for the $n=2$ level are $-3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$, $0$, $0$, and $+3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$.\n\nPart 3: Collection and Ordering of Energy Corrections\n\nWe now collect all the first-order energy corrections for the states with principal quantum numbers $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n-   For $n=1$, there is one state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$, and its energy correction is $E^{(1)} = 0$.\n-   For $n=2$, there are four states, and their energy corrections are $-3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$, $0$, $0$, and $+3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$.\n\nThe complete set of five energy corrections is $\\{0, -3e\\mathcal{E}a_0, 0, 0, 3e\\mathcal{E}a_0\\}$. The problem requires these to be reported in ascending order. Since $e$, $\\mathcal{E}$, and $a_0$ are positive quantities, the ascending order is:\n$$-3e\\mathcal{E}a_0, \\quad 0, \\quad 0, \\quad 0, \\quad 3e\\mathcal{E}a_0$$\nThese are presented as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-3e\\mathcal{E}a_{0} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3e\\mathcal{E}a_{0}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2676177"}]}
