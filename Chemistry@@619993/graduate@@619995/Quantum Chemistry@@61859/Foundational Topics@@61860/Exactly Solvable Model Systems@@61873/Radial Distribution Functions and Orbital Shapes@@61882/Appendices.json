The ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=1$ and the orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\ell=0$.\n\nThe radial distribution function $P_{n\\ell}(r)$ is defined as the probability density of finding the electron at a radial distance $r$ from the nucleus, integrated over all solid angles. It is given by the formula $P_{n\\ell}(r) = r^{2}|R_{n\\ell}(r)|^{2}$, where $R_{n\\ell}(r)$ is the radial part of the wavefunction.

The pre-factor $4\\left(\\frac{Z}{a_{0}}\\right)^{3}$ and the exponential term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2Zr}{a_{0}}\\right)$ are non-zero for any finite $r>0$. Thus, we must have:\n$$\n2r - \\frac{2Zr^{2}}{a_{0}} = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $2r$:\n$$\n2r\\left(1 - \\frac{Zr}{a_{0}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two solutions for $r$: $r=0$ and $r = \\frac{a_{0}}{Z}$. The solution $r=0$ corresponds to a minimum, as $P_{10}(0)=0$ and the function is strictly positive for $r>0$. The other solution must correspond to the maximum. We can verify this by examining the sign of the first derivative. For $0 < r < a_{0}/Z$, the term $(1 - Zr/a_{0})$ is positive, so $\\frac{dP_{10}}{dr} > 0$ and the function is increasing. For $r > a_{0}/Z$, the term $(1 - Zr/a_{0})$ is negative, so $\\frac{dP_{10}}{dr} < 0$ and the function is decreasing. This confirms that $r = a_{0}/Z$ is a local maximum. Since $P_{10}(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$, this is the global maximum.\nThus, the most probable radius is:\n$$\nr_{\\max} = \\frac{a_{0}}{Z}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the peak value of the radial distribution function, $P_{10}(r_{\\max})$, by substituting $r_{\\max}$ back into the expression for $P_{10}(r)$:\n$$\nP_{10}(r_{\\max}) = 4\\left(\\frac{Z}{a_{0}}\\right)^{3} (r_{\\max})^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2Zr_{\\max}}{a_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nP_{10}(r_{\\max}) = 4\\left(\\frac{Z}{a_{0}}\\right)^{3} \\left(\\frac{a_{0}}{Z}\\right)^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2Z}{a_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{a_{0}}{Z}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nP_{10}(r_{\\max}) = 4\\left(\\frac{Z^{3}}{a_{0}^{3}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{Z^{2}}\\right) \\exp(-2)\n$$\n$$\nP_{10}(r_{\\max}) = \\frac{4Z}{a_{0}} \\exp(-2)\n$$\nThe physical meaning of $r_{\\max}$ is that it is the most probable radial distance of the electron from the nucleus. It is crucial to distinguish this from the expectation value (average value) of the radius, $\\langle r \\rangle$, which for the $1s$ state is $\\langle r \\rangle_{1s} = \\frac{3a_{0}}{2Z}$. The $1s$ orbital is spherically symmetric, and while the wavefunction magnitude $|\\psi_{10}|$ is largest at the nucleus ($r=0$), the probability of finding the electron in a thin spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ is given by $P_{10}(r)dr$. The volume of this shell is approximately $4\\pi r^{2}dr$. The $r^{2}$ factor in the definition of $P_{10}(r)$ ensures that the probability of finding the electron exactly at the point-like nucleus ($r=0$) is zero, and it shifts the maximum of the probability distribution to a finite, non-zero radius.\n\nRegarding the scaling with nuclear charge $Z$, the most probable radius $r_{\\max} = a_{0}/Z$ is inversely proportional to $Z$. As the nuclear charge increases, the electrostatic attraction on the electron becomes stronger, pulling the electron orbital closer to the nucleus. Consequently, the most probable radius decreases. This contraction of the atomic orbitals with increasing nuclear charge is a fundamental effect in atomic physics. For a hydrogen atom ($Z=1$), the most probable radius is exactly one Bohr radius, $r_{\\max} = a_{0}$. For a helium ion $\\text{He}^{+}$ ($Z=2$), it is $a_{0}/2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a_{0}}{Z} & \\frac{4Z}{a_{0}}\\exp(-2) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2919129"}, {"introduction": "Building on the analysis of the simple $1s$ orbital, we now explore the more complex structure of the $2s$ orbital.

In the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we can approximate $\\psi(r)$ inside the integral by its value at the origin, $\\psi(0)$, as any variation will be of higher order.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\text{RHS} = -8\\pi\\psi(0) \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} \\int_0^\\epsilon (E r^2 + Z r) dr\n$$\nThe integral is elementary:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\epsilon (E r^2 + Z r) dr = \\left[ E\\frac{r^3}{3} + Z\\frac{r^2}{2} \\right]_0^\\epsilon = E\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{3} + Z\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\n$$\nSo, in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the RHS becomes:\n$$\n\\text{RHS} \\approx -8\\pi\\psi(0) \\left( E\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{3} + Z\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$$\n4\\pi\\epsilon^2\\psi'(\\epsilon) \\approx -8\\pi\\psi(0) \\left( E\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{3} + Z\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\nWe divide by $4\\pi\\epsilon^2$, assuming $\\epsilon \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\psi'(\\epsilon) \\approx -2\\psi(0) \\left( E\\frac{\\epsilon}{3} + \\frac{Z}{2} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. The term with energy $E$ vanishes.\n$$\n\\psi'(0) = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+} \\psi'(\\epsilon) = -2\\psi(0) \\left( 0 + \\frac{Z}{2} \\right) = -Z\\psi(0)\n$$\nThis is the required leading-order relation. If $\\psi(0) \\neq 0$, which is true for $s$-type orbitals, we can write this as $\\frac{\\psi'(0)}{\\psi(0)} = -Z$. This is the nuclear cusp condition.\n\nPart 2: Evaluation of the derivative ratio for trial wavefunctions.\nThe total wavefunction is given as $\\psi(r) = R(r)Y_{00}(\\theta,\\phi)$. Since $Y_{00} = 1/\\sqrt{4\\pi}$ is a constant, it does not affect the ratio $\\psi'(r)/\\psi(r)$. Let the unnormalized radial part be $R(r)$. We have $\\psi(r) \\propto R(r)$, so $\\frac{\\psi'(r)}{\\psi(r)} = \\frac{R'(r)}{R(r)}$.\n\nFor the Slater-type orbital (STO):\n$R_{\\text{STO}}(r) = N_{\\text{STO}}\\exp(-\\zeta r)$, where $N_{\\text{STO}}$ is a normalization constant.\nThe derivative is $R'_{\\text{STO}}(r) = N_{\\text{STO}}(-\\zeta)\\exp(-\\zeta r) = -\\zeta R_{\\text{STO}}(r)$.\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{R'_{\\text{STO}}(r)}{R_{\\text{STO}}(r)} = -\\zeta\n$$\nThis ratio is constant for all $r$. Evaluating at $r=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\psi'(r)}{\\psi(r)}\\right|_{r=0}^{\\text{STO}} = -\\zeta\n$$\n\nFor the Gaussian-type orbital (GTO):\n$R_{\\text{GTO}}(r) = N_{\\text{GTO}}\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$, where $N_{\\text{GTO}}$ is a normalization constant.\nThe derivative is $R'_{\\text{GTO}}(r) = N_{\\text{GTO}}(-2\\alpha r)\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{R'_{\\text{GTO}}(r)}{R_{\\text{GTO}}(r)} = \\frac{N_{\\text{GTO}}(-2\\alpha r)\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)}{N_{\\text{GTO}}\\exp(-\\alpha r^2)} = -2\\alpha r\n$$\nEvaluating this ratio at $r=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\psi'(r)}{\\psi(r)}\\right|_{r=0}^{\\text{GTO}} = -2\\alpha(0) = 0\n$$\n\nPart 3: Evaluation of the derivative mismatch.\nThe derivative mismatch is defined as $\\Delta = \\left.\\left(\\frac{\\psi'(r)}{\\psi(r)} + Z\\right)\\right|_{r=0}$. This quantity measures how well a trial wavefunction satisfies the exact cusp condition derived in Part 1. For an exact eigenfunction, $\\Delta = -Z + Z = 0$.\n\nFor the STO, we use the result from Part 2:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{STO}} = \\left(-\\zeta + Z\\right) = Z - \\zeta\n$$\nAn STO can satisfy the cusp condition exactly ($\\Delta_{\\text{STO}} = 0$) if the exponent $\\zeta$ is chosen to be equal to the nuclear charge $Z$. This is indeed the case for the exact $1s$ ground state wavefunction of a hydrogen-like atom.\n\nFor the GTO, we use its corresponding result from Part 2:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{GTO}} = (0 + Z) = Z\n$$\nA single GTO can never satisfy the cusp condition unless the nuclear charge $Z$ is zero, which is unphysical. The GTO always has a zero derivative at the nucleus, failing to reproduce the sharp cusp of the exact wavefunction. This is a well-known deficiency of GTO basis sets, which is typically compensated by using linear combinations of multiple GTOs to approximate the cusp.\n\nThe problem asks for a single row matrix containing the STO mismatch and then the GTO mismatch.\nThe entries are $\\Delta_{\\text{STO}} = Z - \\zeta$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{GTO}} = Z$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ - \\zeta & Z\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2919142"}]}
