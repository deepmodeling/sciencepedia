It is a standard problem in quantum mechanics and is therefore valid.\n\nWe begin with the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a single particle of mass $m$ in a region where the potential $V(x,y,z)$ is zero:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2}\\psi(x,y,z) = E\\,\\psi(x,y,z)$$\nThe Laplacian operator in Cartesian coordinates is $\\nabla^{2} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial z^{2}}$. The equation is a partial differential equation, which we can solve using the method of separation of variables. We assume the stationary-state wavefunction $\\psi(x,y,z)$ can be expressed as a product of three independent, single-variable functions:\n$$\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$$\nSubstituting this into the TISE gives:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left(Y(y)Z(z)\\frac{d^{2}X(x)}{dx^{2}} + X(x)Z(z)\\frac{d^{2}Y(y)}{dy^{2}} + X(x)Y(y)\\frac{d^{2}Z(z)}{dz^{2}}\\right) = E\\,X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$$\nDividing the entire equation by $\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$ yields:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left(\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X(x)}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^{2}Y(y)}{dy^{2}} + \\frac{1}{Z(z)}\\frac{d^{2}Z(z)}{dz^{2}}\\right) = E$$\nThe sum of three terms, each depending on a single independent variable ($x$, $y$, or $z$), is equal to a constant, $E$. This can only be true if each term is itself a constant. Let us define these separation constants as $-k_{x}^{2}$, $-k_{y}^{2}$, and $-k_{z}^{2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X(x)}{dx^{2}} = -k_{x}^{2} \\quad ; \\quad \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^{2}Y(y)}{dy^{2}} = -k_{y}^{2} \\quad ; \\quad \\frac{1}{Z(z)}\\frac{d^{2}Z(z)}{dz^{2}} = -k_{z}^{2}$$\nThis separates the TISE into three ordinary differential equations:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}X(x)}{dx^{2}} + k_{x}^{2}X(x) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}Y(y)}{dy^{2}} + k_{y}^{2}Y(y) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}Z(z)}{dz^{2}} + k_{z}^{2}Z(z) = 0$$\nThe total energy $E$ is related to the separation constants by:\n$$\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}(k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} + k_{z}^{2}) = E$$\nThe general solution to the equation for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = A\\sin(k_{x}x) + B\\cos(k_{x}x)$. The boundary conditions state that the wavefunction must be zero on the walls of the box, where the potential is infinite. For the $x$-dimension, this means $\\psi(0,y,z)=0$ and $\\psi(L,y,z)=0$, which implies $X(0)=0$ and $X(L)=0$.\nApplying the first boundary condition: $X(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0$.\nThe solution is thus of the form $X(x) = A\\sin(k_{x}x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition: $X(L) = A\\sin(k_{x}L) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(k_{x}L) = 0$. This condition is met when $k_{x}L = n_{x}\\pi$, where $n_{x}$ is an integer.\nThus, the allowed values for $k_{x}$ are quantized: $k_{x} = \\frac{n_{x}\\pi}{L}$.\nThe integer $n_{x}$ must be a positive integer, $n_x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. If $n_x = 0$, then $k_x = 0$ and $X(x)=0$, leading to a trivial wavefunction $\\psi=0$, which is physically unacceptable as it implies there is no particle. Negative integers for $n_x$ do not produce new physical states, as they only change the sign of the wavefunction.\nBy identical reasoning for the $y$ and $z$ dimensions, we find:\n$$k_{y} = \\frac{n_{y}\\pi}{L}, \\quad n_{y} \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$$\n$$k_{z} = \\frac{n_{z}\\pi}{L}, \\quad n_{z} \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$$\nSubstituting these quantized wave numbers into the expression for the total energy gives the allowed energy eigenvalues, indexed by the three quantum numbers $(n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z})$:\n$$E_{n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left(\\left(\\frac{n_{x}\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{n_{y}\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{n_{z}\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}(n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2})$$\nThe ground state is the state with the minimum possible energy. This occurs when the quantum numbers $n_{x}$, $n_{y}$, and $n_{z}$ take their smallest possible values, which are all $1$.\n$$E_{\\text{ground}} = E_{1,1,1} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}(1^{2} + 1^{2} + 1^{2}) = \\frac{3\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}$$\nThe first excited states are those with the next lowest energy. We must find the next smallest integer value for the sum of squares $S = n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2}$, greater than the ground state value of $S=3$. By setting one quantum number to $2$ and the others to $1$, we obtain $S = 2^{2} + 1^{2} + 1^{2} = 6$. Any other combination of allowed quantum numbers results in a larger value for $S$ (e.g., $(2,2,1)$ gives $S=9$).\nThere are three combinations of quantum numbers that yield $S=6$: $(2,1,1)$, $(1,2,1)$, and $(1,1,2)$. All three of these distinct states have the same energy:\n$$E_{\\text{first}} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}(2^{2} + 1^{2} + 1^{2}) = \\frac{6\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}$$\nMultiple distinct states, or wavefunctions, can exist for the first excited level because the energy for a cubic box depends only on the sum $n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2$. The high symmetry of the cube makes the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions physically equivalent. Therefore, permuting the quantum numbers among the three directions, such as in states $(2,1,1)$, $(1,2,1)$, and $(1,1,2)$, does not change the total energy, leading to a degeneracy of $3$ for the first excited energy level.\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the first excited state energy to the ground state energy:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{first}}}{E_{\\text{ground}}} = \\frac{\\frac{6\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}}{\\frac{3\\hbar^{2}\\pi^{2}}{2mL^{2}}} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2$$\nThe final ratio is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2914154"}, {"introduction": "While the degeneracy of the first excited state arises purely from the box's spatial symmetry, not all degeneracies are so straightforward.

It is a standard exercise in introductory quantum mechanics. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a single particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional potential $V(x,y,z)$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y,z) + V(x,y,z) \\psi(x,y,z) = E \\psi(x,y,z) $$\nwhere $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$ is the Laplacian operator, $\\psi(x,y,z)$ is the stationary-state wave function, and $E$ is the energy eigenvalue.\n\nThe potential is defined as $V(x,y,z) = 0$ inside the cubic box ($0<x<L$, $0<y<L$, $0<z<L$) and $V(x,y,z) = \\infty$ outside. The infinite potential at the boundaries requires the wave function to vanish at the walls, i.e., $\\psi(x,y,z) = 0$ for $x=0,L$, $y=0,L$, and $z=0,L$.\n\nInside the box, where $V=0$, the TISE simplifies to:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial z^2} \\right) = E \\psi $$\nWe employ the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$.

For the equation to hold for all $(x,y,z)$, each term must equal a constant. We define these separation constants as $E_x$, $E_y$, and $E_z$, such that $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$. This decomposes the 3D problem into three independent 1D problems:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = E_x X(x) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = E_y Y(y) $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2} = E_z Z(z) $$\nLet us solve the equation for $X(x)$. Its general solution is $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x) + B \\cos(k_x x)$, where $k_x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE_x}}{\\hbar}$. The boundary conditions are $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L)=0$.\nApplying $X(0)=0$:\n$A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0$. The solution must be of the form $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x)$.\nApplying $X(L)=0$:\n$A \\sin(k_x L) = 0$. Since $A=0$ leads to a trivial solution, we must have $\\sin(k_x L)=0$. This implies $k_x L = n_x \\pi$, where $n_x$ must be an integer. The case $n_x=0$ would again render the wave function trivial ($\\psi=0$), and negative values of $n_x$ do not produce new, linearly independent solutions. Therefore, $n_x$ must be a positive integer: $n_x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nFrom this quantization condition, we find $k_x = \\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}$, and the energy component $E_x$ is:\n$$ E_x = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_x^2}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n_x^2}{2mL^2} $$\nBy symmetry, the solutions for $Y(y)$ and $Z(z)$ are identical in form, with their respective positive integer quantum numbers $n_y$ and $n_z$:\n$$ E_y = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n_y^2}{2mL^2} \\quad (n_y = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots) $$\n$$ E_z = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n_z^2}{2mL^2} \\quad (n_z = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots) $$\nThe total energy of a stationary state, specified by the set of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, is the sum of these components:\n$$ E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_x + E_y + E_z = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) $$\nThis is the required energy spectrum.\n\nNext, we are to investigate the energy shell for which $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 50$. The problem states that this corresponds to the unordered set $\\{3,4,5\\}$. A quick check confirms this: $3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50$.\n\nNow we address the question of \"accidental degeneracy,\" which is defined in the problem as the existence of a distinct unordered triple of positive integers $\\{n_x', n_y', n_z'\\}$ that also satisfies the sum-of-squares condition. To determine this, we must find all unique sets of three positive integers $\\{n_x, n_y, n_z\\}$ whose squares sum to $50$. Let us perform a systematic search, assuming $1 \\le n_x \\le n_y \\le n_z$. The largest possible integer is $\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07$, so $n_i \\le 7$.\n\n1.  Let $n_x = 1$: $n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 50 - 1^2 = 49$. The only integer solution to $a^2+b^2=7^2$ is $(0,7)$. Since $n_y$ must be a positive integer, there is no solution.\n2.  Let $n_x = 2$: $n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 50 - 2^2 = 46$. We check integer squares less than $46$: $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36$. None of these pairs sum to $46$. No solution.\n3.  Let $n_x = 3$: $n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 50 - 3^2 = 41$. We check integer squares. $41 - 4^2 = 41 - 16 = 25 = 5^2$. This gives the solution $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$. We also have $n_y \\ge n_x=3$. So this is a valid solution.\n4.  Let $n_x = 4$: $n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 50 - 4^2 = 34$. We require $n_y \\ge 4$. $34 - 4^2 = 34 - 16 = 18$ (not a square). No solution.\n5.  Let $n_x = 5$: $n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 50 - 5^2 = 25$. We require $n_y \\ge 5$. This forces $n_y = 5$, giving $n_z^2 = 0$, which is not a positive integer. No solution.\n\nThe only unordered set of three positive integers whose squares sum to $50$ is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$. Therefore, according to the problem's definition, there is no accidental degeneracy for this energy level. All degeneracy associated with this level arises from the permutation of the quantum numbers, which is a direct consequence of the spatial symmetry of the cubic box. This is termed symmetry degeneracy.\n\nFinally, we compute the total degeneracy, $g$, of this energy level. The degeneracy is the number of distinct quantum states $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. Since the energy is determined by $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2$, we must count all distinct ordered triples $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that can be formed from the set $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$. The numbers $3$, $4$, and $5$ are all distinct. The number of permutations of $3$ distinct items is $3!$.\n$$ g = 3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 $$\nThe distinct states are $(3,4,5)$, $(3,5,4)$, $(4,3,5)$, $(4,5,3)$, $(5,3,4)$, and $(5,4,3)$. Each of these corresponds to a unique wave function $\\psi_{n_x, n_y, n_z}$ and has the exact same energy $E = \\frac{50 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n\nThe total degeneracy $g$ of this energy level is $6$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{6} $$", "id": "2914183"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the existence and nature of degenerate states is a prerequisite for studying how quantum systems respond to external influences.

Let us examine if this condition can be satisfied for any pair of distinct states in our degenerate manifold.\nLet $|\\psi_i\\rangle = |n_x, n_y, n_z\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_j\\rangle = |n_x', n_y', n_z'\\rangle$ be two distinct states ($i \\neq j$). The set of quantum numbers for each state, $\\{n_x, n_y, n_z\\}$ and $\\{n_x', n_y', n_z'\\}$, must be a permutation of $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nIf we impose the condition for a non-zero off-diagonal element, $n_y=n_y'$ and $n_z=n_z'$, then the two sets of quantum numbers must share two identical values. Since each set is a permutation of $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the third quantum number must also be identical, i.e., $n_x=n_x'$. This would imply that $|\\psi_i\\rangle = |\\psi_j\\rangle$, which contradicts our initial assumption that $i \\neq j$.\nTherefore, for any pair of distinct states within this specific degenerate manifold, it is impossible for the condition $(n_y=n_y' \\text{ and } n_z=n_z')$ to be met. This means at least one of the Kronecker deltas $\\delta_{n_y n_y'}$ or $\\delta_{n_z n_z'}$ must be zero.\nAs a result, all off-diagonal matrix elements are zero: $W_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe perturbation matrix $W$ is diagonal:\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{FL}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{FL}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{FL}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{FL}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{FL}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{FL}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first-order energy corrections are the eigenvalues of this matrix. For a diagonal matrix, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries. In this case, all eigenvalues are identical.\n$$\n\\Delta E^{(1)} = \\frac{FL}{2}\n$$\nThis means that the perturbation $V' = Fx$ shifts the energy of all six states in the manifold by the same amount. The sixfold degeneracy is not lifted to first order in the perturbation. The unperturbed basis states are the correct zero-order wavefunctions, and no mixing occurs. The common energy correction for each state is $\\frac{FL}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{FL}{2}}$$", "id": "2914169"}]}
