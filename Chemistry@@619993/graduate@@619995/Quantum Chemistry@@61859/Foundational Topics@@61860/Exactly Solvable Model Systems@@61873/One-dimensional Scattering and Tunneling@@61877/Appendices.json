To ensure normalizability, the wavefunction must vanish at infinity.\nFor $x > 0$, we require $\\psi(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. This is only possible if the coefficient of the growing exponential $e^{kx}$ is zero. Thus, for $x>0$, the solution must be of the form $\\psi(x) = C_1 e^{-kx}$.\nFor $x < 0$, we require $\\psi(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$. This is only possible if the coefficient of the growing exponential $e^{-kx}$ is zero. Thus, for $x<0$, the solution must be of the form $\\psi(x) = C_2 e^{kx}$.\n\nThe wavefunction must be continuous at $x=0$, so $\\psi(0^{+}) = \\psi(0^{-})$. This implies $C_1 e^0 = C_2 e^0$, so $C_1=C_2$. Let us denote this common amplitude by $A$. The wavefunction for the bound state is therefore an even function:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A e^{-k|x|}\n$$\nThe value at the origin is $\\psi(0) = A$. Now, we apply the derivative boundary condition.

This confirms that a bound state exists only for an attractive potential.\n\nFor $\\lambda < 0$, the energy of this bound state is found by substituting the expression for $k$ back into the energy definition:\n$$\nE = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( -\\frac{m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} \\right)^2 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{m^2\\lambda^2}{\\hbar^4} = -\\frac{m\\lambda^2}{2\\hbar^2}\n$$\nThis is the energy of the single bound state that exists for $\\lambda < 0$.\n\nConversely, if $\\lambda > 0$ (a repulsive potential), the relation $k = -\\frac{m\\lambda}{\\hbar^{2}}$ requires that $k$ be negative. However, our initial requirement for a bound state was $k>0$ so that the wavefunction $\\psi(x) = A e^{-k|x|}$ would be normalizable (decaying at infinity). A negative $k$ would lead to a wavefunction that diverges as $|x| \\to \\infty$, which is unphysical. Therefore, no normalizable bound state solution with $E<0$ exists for $\\lambda>0$. The case $\\lambda=0$ corresponds to a free particle, which has no bound states; our formula for $E$ correctly yields $E=0$ in this limit.\n\nTo express the bound-state energy $E_b(\\lambda)$ for all real $\\lambda$ in a single expression, we use the Heaviside step function, $\\Theta(x)$, defined as $\\Theta(x)=1$ for $x>0$ and $\\Theta(x)=0$ for $x<0$. The bound state energy is non-zero only for $\\lambda < 0$. The condition $\\lambda < 0$ is equivalent to $-\\lambda > 0$. Therefore, we can multiply the energy expression by $\\Theta(-\\lambda)$:\n$$\nE_b(\\lambda) = -\\frac{m\\lambda^2}{2\\hbar^2} \\Theta(-\\lambda)\n$$\nThis expression correctly gives $E_b = -\\frac{m\\lambda^2}{2\\hbar^2}$ for $\\lambda < 0$ and $E_b = 0$ for $\\lambda \\ge 0$, indicating the absence of a stable bound state with negative energy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{m\\lambda^2}{2\\hbar^2}\\Theta(-\\lambda)}\n$$", "id": "2909694"}, {"introduction": "In addition to hosting bound states, potentials also influence the behavior of incident particles in scattering events ($E \\gt 0$).
