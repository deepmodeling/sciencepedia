The integrand is a product of two functions: $|Y_{\\ell}^{m}|^2$ and $\\cos\\theta$.\n\n1.  **Parity of $|Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)|^2$**:\n    The problem statement provides the parity transformation property of the spherical harmonics: $Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\pi-\\theta, \\phi+\\pi) = (-1)^{\\ell} Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$.\n    We apply this to the function $|Y_{\\ell}^{m}|^2 = [Y_{\\ell}^{m}]^* Y_{\\ell}^{m}$:\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\Pi} |Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)|^2 = |Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\pi-\\theta, \\phi+\\pi)|^2 = |(-1)^{\\ell} Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)|^2\n    $$\n    Since $\\ell$ is an integer, $(-1)^{\\ell}$ is a real number.

These rules dictate when integrals involving products of spherical harmonics are non-zero.\n\n1.  **Operator Representation**:\n    The operator $\\cos\\theta$ can be expressed in terms of the spherical harmonic $Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi)$. The explicit relation is:\n    $$\n    Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}} \\cos\\theta \\quad \\implies \\quad \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi)\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the expectation value integral:\n    $$\n    \\langle Y_{\\ell}^{m} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{\\ell}^{m} \\rangle = \\left\\langle Y_{\\ell}^{m} \\left| \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} Y_1^0 \\right| Y_{\\ell}^{m} \\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} \\int [Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)]^* Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi) Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta, \\phi) \\, d\\Omega\n    $$\n\n2.  **Selection Rules for Three-Harmonic Integrals**:\n    The integral is of the general form $\\int [Y_{\\ell_1}^{m_1}]^* Y_{\\ell_2}^{m_2} Y_{\\ell_3}^{m_3} \\, d\\Omega$. Such an integral is non-zero only if several conditions, known as selection rules, are satisfied.\n    One fundamental selection rule arises from parity. As shown in the first method, the integrand must be an even function for its integral over the sphere to be non-zero. The parity of the integrand $[Y_{\\ell_1}^{m_1}]^* Y_{\\ell_2}^{m_2} Y_{\\ell_3}^{m_3}$ is $(-1)^{\\ell_1} (-1)^{\\ell_2} (-1)^{\\ell_3} = (-1)^{\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 + \\ell_3}$.\n    Thus, a necessary condition for the integral to be non-zero is that the sum of the angular momentum quantum numbers, $\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 + \\ell_3$, must be an even integer.\n\n3.  **Application to the Problem**:\n    For the integral in question, we identify the angular momentum quantum numbers as:\n    $\\ell_1 = \\ell$ (from $[Y_{\\ell}^{m}]^*$),\n    $\\ell_2 = 1$ (from $Y_1^0$),\n    $\\ell_3 = \\ell$ (from $Y_{\\ell}^{m}$).\n    The sum of these quantum numbers is:\n    $$\n    \\ell_1 + \\ell_2 + \\ell_3 = \\ell + 1 + \\ell = 2\\ell + 1\n    $$\n    Since $\\ell$ is an integer by definition, $2\\ell$ is always an even integer. Consequently, the sum $2\\ell + 1$ is always an odd integer for any possible value of $\\ell$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    The parity selection rule ($\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 + \\ell_3$ must be even) is violated for all $\\ell$. Therefore, the integral is identically zero.\n    $$\n    \\int [Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)]^* Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi) Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta, \\phi) \\, d\\Omega = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that the expectation value is also zero:\n    $$\n    \\langle Y_{\\ell}^{m} | \\cos\\theta | Y_{\\ell}^{m} \\rangle = 0\n    $$\n\nBoth methods, one based on a direct analysis of the integrand's symmetry and the other on the application of general angular momentum selection rules, lead to the same unambiguous conclusion. The expectation value of $\\cos\\theta$ in any eigenstate of orbital angular momentum is zero. This signifies that the probability distribution $|\\Psi|^2 = |Y_{\\ell}^{m}|^2$ is symmetric with respect to the $xy$-plane (i.e., symmetric under the reflection $z \\to -z$), and the expectation value of the odd function $z = r\\cos\\theta$ must consequently vanish.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2924901"}]}
