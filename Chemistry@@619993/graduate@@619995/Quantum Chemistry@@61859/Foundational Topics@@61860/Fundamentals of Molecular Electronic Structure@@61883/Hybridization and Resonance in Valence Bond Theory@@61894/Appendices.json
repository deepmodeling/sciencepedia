A hybrid orbital $\\psi_i$ is a linear combination of the carbon $2s$ atomic orbital (denoted as $|s\\rangle$) and a directional $2p$ atomic orbital (denoted as $|p_i\\rangle$). We can write this as:\n$$\n\\psi_i = c_{is} |s\\rangle + c_{ip} |p_i\\rangle\n$$\nThe orbitals $|s\\rangle$ and $|p_i\\rangle$ are assumed to be normalized, and they are orthogonal, i.e., $\\langle s | p_i \\rangle = 0$.

From the normalization condition, it follows that the $p$-character is $c_{ip}^2 = 1 - s_i$. Thus, we may write the normalized hybrid orbital, choosing real positive coefficients without loss of generality, as:\n$$\n\\psi_i = \\sqrt{s_i} |s\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-s_i} |p_i\\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states that the four hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom are mutually orthogonal.

By symmetry, all four substituents (hydrogen atoms) are identical. This implies that the four carbon hybrid orbitals directed towards them must also be equivalent. Thus, $s_1 = s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = s_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The total $s$-character is conserved, so $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} s_i = 1$. This gives $4 s_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1$, which means $s_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{1}{4}$.
