A sign change occurs between every adjacent pair of atoms.\n\nThe number of nodes increases with the energy of the molecular orbital, from $0$ for the ground state MO to $N-1=3$ for the highest energy MO. This is a general feature of such systems. The problem asks for the closed-form energies corresponding to the ascending index $m=1,2,3,4$. These are the four expressions for $E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4$ derived above. The question also specifies these arise from the boundary-value problem, for which the canonical solution form is $E_m = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos(\\frac{m\\pi}{N+1})$. Both forms, one with trigonometric functions and one with radicals, are equivalent and correct closed forms. We will provide the latter as it is the direct result of solving the secular determinant polynomial, while noting that both are equivalent.\nThe final required answer is the ordered set of energies.\n$E_1 = \\alpha + 2\\beta\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{5}) = \\alpha + \\beta\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n$E_2 = \\alpha + 2\\beta\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}) = \\alpha + \\beta\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\n$E_3 = \\alpha + 2\\beta\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{5}) = \\alpha - \\beta\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\n$E_4 = \\alpha + 2\\beta\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}) = \\alpha - \\beta\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n\nThe problem requests the solution from the boundary-value problem for a chain of length $n=4$ with ascending index $m=1,2,3,4$.
