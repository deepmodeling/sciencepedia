The definitions of the Coulomb integral ($\\alpha$), resonance integral ($\\beta$), and overlap integral ($S$) are standard. The conditions $\\beta  0$ and $0  S  1$ are physically correct for interacting atomic orbitals.

It is a formalizable and solvable problem within its defined theoretical framework.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe molecular orbitals (MOs) $\\psi$ are formed as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals (AOs) $\\chi_{A}$ and $\\chi_{B}$:\n$$ \\psi = c_{A}\\chi_{A} + c_{B}\\chi_{B} $$\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation is $H\\psi = E\\psi$. Applying the variational principle leads to the secular equations, which have a non-trivial solution for the coefficients $\\{c_A, c_B\\}$ only if the secular determinant is zero:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nH_{AA} - E S_{AA}  H_{AB} - E S_{AB} \\\\\nH_{BA} - E S_{BA}  H_{BB} - E S_{BB}\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nGiven that the AOs are normalized, $S_{AA} = \\langle \\chi_{A}|\\chi_{A}\\rangle = 1$ and $S_{BB} = \\langle \\chi_{B}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle = 1$. Using the provided definitions $H_{AA} = H_{BB} = \\alpha$, $H_{AB} = H_{BA} = \\beta$, and $S_{AB} = S_{BA} = S$, the determinant becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\alpha - E  \\beta - ES \\\\\n\\beta - ES  \\alpha - E\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the quadratic equation:\n$$ (\\alpha - E)^{2} - (\\beta - ES)^{2} = 0 $$\n$$ \\alpha - E = \\pm(\\beta - ES) $$\nThis yields two energy eigenvalues.\n\n1.  **Derivation of Molecular Orbitals and Energies**\n\nFor the first root, $\\alpha - E = +(\\beta - ES)$, we have $E(1-S) = \\alpha - \\beta$, which gives the energy $E_{a}$:\n$$ E_{a} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1-S} $$\nFor the second root, $\\alpha - E = -(\\beta - ES)$, we have $E(1+S) = \\alpha + \\beta$, which gives the energy $E_{b}$:\n$$ E_{b} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1+S} $$\nTo determine which MO is bonding and which is antibonding, we compare their energies to the energy of the constituent AOs, $\\alpha$. Given $\\beta  0$ and $0  S  1$:\n-   For $E_{b}$: The denominator $1+S > 1$. The numerator $\\alpha + \\beta$ is more negative than $\\alpha$ (since orbital energies are negative, and $\\beta$ is also negative). Thus, $E_{b}  \\alpha$. This corresponds to the **bonding** molecular orbital.\n-   For $E_{a}$: The denominator $1-S  1$. The numerator $\\alpha - \\beta$ is less negative (more positive) than $\\alpha$. Thus, $E_{a} > \\alpha$. This corresponds to the **antibonding** molecular orbital.\nThe energetic ordering is $E_{b}  \\alpha  E_{a}$.\n\nTo find the corresponding MO wavefunctions, we substitute the energies back into one of the secular equations, for example $(\\alpha - E)c_{A} + (\\beta - ES)c_{B} = 0$.\n\nFor the bonding orbital energy $E_{b} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1+S}$:\n$$ \\left(\\alpha - \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1+S}\\right)c_{A} + \\left(\\beta - S\\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1+S}\\right)c_{B} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\alpha(1+S) - (\\alpha+\\beta)}{1+S}\\right)c_{A} + \\left(\\frac{\\beta(1+S) - S(\\alpha+\\beta)}{1+S}\\right)c_{B} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\alpha S - \\beta)c_{A} + (\\beta - \\alpha S)c_{B} = 0 \\implies c_{A} = c_{B} $$\nNormalization requires $\\int \\psi_{b}^{2} d\\tau = 1$. For $\\psi_{b} = N_{b}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B})$:\n$$ N_{b}^{2} \\langle \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} \\rangle = N_{b}^{2}(\\langle\\chi_{A}|\\chi_{A}\\rangle + \\langle\\chi_{B}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle + 2\\langle\\chi_{A}|\\chi_{B}\\rangle) = N_{b}^{2}(1 + 1 + 2S) = 1 $$\nThis gives $N_{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S)}}$. The bonding MO (of $\\sigma_{g}$ symmetry) is $\\psi_{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S)}}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B})$.\n\nFor the antibonding orbital energy $E_{a} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1-S}$:\n$$ (\\alpha - E_{a})c_{A} + (\\beta - E_{a}S)c_{B} = 0 $$\nA similar substitution and algebraic manipulation yields $c_{A} = -c_{B}$.\nNormalization for $\\psi_{a} = N_{a}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B})$:\n$$ N_{a}^{2} \\langle \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} \\rangle = N_{a}^{2}(1 + 1 - 2S) = 1 \\implies N_{a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S)}} $$\nThe antibonding MO (of $\\sigma_{u}^{*}$ symmetry) is $\\psi_{a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S)}}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B})$.\n\n2.  **Ground-State Occupancies for $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$**\n\nA neutral helium atom contributes $2$ electrons.\n-   $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$ has a total of $2+2=4$ electrons. Following the Aufbau principle, we fill the MOs in order of increasing energy. The two lowest energy electrons occupy the bonding orbital $\\psi_{b}$ (with opposite spins, per Pauli principle). The next two electrons must occupy the antibonding orbital $\\psi_{a}$. The ground-state configuration is $(\\sigma_{g})^{2}(\\sigma_{u}^{*})^{2}$.\n-   $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$ has a total of $2+2-1=3$ electrons. The first two electrons occupy the bonding orbital $\\psi_{b}$. The third electron must occupy the antibonding orbital $\\psi_{a}$. The ground-state configuration is $(\\sigma_{g})^{2}(\\sigma_{u}^{*})^{1}$.\n\n3.  **Bond Orders for $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$**\n\nThe bond order (BO) is defined as $\\frac{1}{2}(n_{b} - n_{a})$, where $n_{b}$ is the number of electrons in bonding MOs and $n_{a}$ is the number of electrons in antibonding MOs.\n-   For $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$: $n_{b} = 2$, $n_{a} = 2$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{BO}(\\mathrm{He}_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}(2 - 2) = 0 $$\n-   For $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$: $n_{b} = 2$, $n_{a} = 1$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{BO}(\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2}(2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n4.  **Rationalization of Stability**\n\nThe stability of a molecule relative to its separated constituent atoms is determined by the change in total electronic energy, $\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{molecule}} - E_{\\mathrm{atoms}}$. A negative $\\Delta E$ indicates stability.\nThe reference energy for the separated atoms is the sum of the energies of the electrons in their respective atomic orbitals. The energy of an electron in an isolated $1s$ orbital is $\\alpha$.\n-   For $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$, the reference energy is $E_{\\mathrm{atoms}} = 4\\alpha$.\n-   For $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$, the reference energy is $E_{\\mathrm{atoms}} = 3\\alpha$.\n\nThe total electronic energy of the molecule is the sum of the energies of the occupied MOs.\nFor $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{He}_{2}} = 2E_{b} + 2E_{a} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{1+S}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{1-S}\\right) = \\frac{4(\\alpha - \\beta S)}{1-S^{2}} $$\nThe stabilization energy is:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2}) = E_{\\mathrm{He}_{2}} - 4\\alpha = \\frac{4(\\alpha - \\beta S)}{1-S^{2}} - 4\\alpha = \\frac{4\\alpha - 4\\beta S - 4\\alpha(1-S^{2})}{1-S^{2}} = \\frac{4S(\\alpha S - \\beta)}{1-S^{2}} $$\nSince $S>0$, $1-S^{2}>0$, and it can be shown that the antibonding orbital is more destabilized than the bonding orbital is stabilized, meaning $E_{a} - \\alpha > \\alpha - E_{b}$. This implies $\\frac{\\alpha S - \\beta}{1-S} > \\frac{-(\\beta - \\alpha S)}{1+S}$, which leads to the condition $\\alpha S - \\beta > 0$. Therefore, every term in the expression for $\\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2})$ is positive, so $\\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2}) > 0$. The $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$ molecule is unstable relative to two separate He atoms.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}} = 2E_{b} + 1E_{a} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{1+S}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha-\\beta}{1-S}\\right) $$\nThe stabilization energy is:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}) = E_{\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}} - 3\\alpha = (2E_{b} - 2\\alpha) + (E_{a} - \\alpha) $$\n$$ \\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\beta - \\alpha S}{1+S}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha S - \\beta}{1-S}\\right) = (\\alpha S - \\beta)\\left(\\frac{1}{1-S} - \\frac{2}{1+S}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}) = (\\alpha S - \\beta)\\left(\\frac{(1+S) - 2(1-S)}{1-S^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{(\\alpha S - \\beta)(3S - 1)}{1-S^{2}} $$\nAs established, $\\alpha S - \\beta > 0$. The denominator $1-S^2 > 0$. The sign of $\\Delta E(\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+})$ depends on the sign of $3S-1$. For bond formation to be possible, there must exist a region where $\\Delta E  0$. This occurs when $3S-1  0$, or $S  \\frac{1}{3}$. Since physically realistic values of $S$ for weakly bound species are small (e.g., $S \\approx 0.1-0.3$), the model predicts that $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$ can be energetically stable ($\\Delta E  0$).\n\nThe stability difference is clear: in $\\mathrm{He}_{2}$, the stabilization from two bonding electrons is more than cancelled by the destabilization from two antibonding electrons, leading to net repulsion. In $\\mathrm{He}_{2}^{+}$, the stabilization from two bonding electrons outweighs the destabilization from a single antibonding electron (provided $S$ is not too large), leading to a net attraction and a stable chemical bond, consistent with its bond order of $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2905585"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic two-orbital model, we now address a crucial refinement needed for many real molecules: $s-p$ mixing.

It presents a standard calculation in quantum chemistry based on a specified model of the electronic structure of carbon monoxide. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Mulliken atomic charge on the carbon atom, $q_{\\mathrm{C}}$, in carbon monoxide, $\\mathrm{CO}$, and a rationalization of the molecule's experimental dipole moment, based on a given set of molecular orbital (MO) coefficients in an orthogonal atomic orbital (AO) basis.\n\nFirst, we compute the Mulliken gross atomic populations. The Mulliken population analysis formalism simplifies considerably for an orthonormal AO basis, where the overlap matrix is the identity matrix, $S=I$. In such a case, the gross atomic population $N_A$ for an atom $A$ is the sum of the diagonal elements of the density matrix $P$ corresponding to the AOs centered on that atom.\nThe density matrix element $P_{\\mu\\mu}$ for an AO $\\mu$ is given by the sum over all occupied MOs $k$ of the squared MO coefficient $c_{\\mu k}$ for that AO, weighted by the MO occupation number $n_k$:\n$$ P_{\\mu\\mu} = \\sum_{k} n_k (c_{\\mu k})^2 $$\nThe gross population on atom $A$ is then:\n$$ N_A = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} P_{\\mu\\mu} = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} \\sum_{k} n_k (c_{\\mu k})^2 $$\nThe problem states that there are $5$ occupied MOs, each doubly occupied. Therefore, the occupation number $n_k = 2$ for $k = 1, \\dots, 5$. The total number of valence electrons is $N_{e} = 5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n\nThe basis functions are ordered as follows: AOs $1, 2, 3, 4$ are on carbon ($\\mathrm{C}\\,2s, \\mathrm{C}\\,2p_x, \\mathrm{C}\\,2p_y, \\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z$), and AOs $5, 6, 7, 8$ are on oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}\\,2s, \\mathrm{O}\\,2p_x, \\mathrm{O}\\,2p_y, \\mathrm{O}\\,2p_z$).\n\nThe gross atomic population on carbon, $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$, is calculated by summing over the AOs on carbon ($\\mu = 1, 2, 3, 4$):\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 2 \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{1k})^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{2k})^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{3k})^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{4k})^2 \\right) $$\nWe are given the five occupied MO coefficient vectors $C^{(k)} = (c_{1k}, c_{2k}, \\dots, c_{8k})^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Let us extract the coefficients for the carbon AOs:\nFor AO $1$ ($\\mathrm{C}\\,2s$): The only non-zero coefficient is $c_{12} = 1$ from the $4\\sigma$ MO ($C^{(2)}$).\nFor AO $2$ ($\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_x$): The only non-zero coefficient is $c_{23} = 0.3$ from the $1\\pi_x$ MO ($C^{(3)}$).\nFor AO $3$ ($\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_y$): The only non-zero coefficient is $c_{34} = 0.3$ from the $1\\pi_y$ MO ($C^{(4)}$).\nFor AO $4$ ($\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z$): The only non-zero coefficient is $c_{45} = \\sqrt{0.85}$ from the $5\\sigma$ MO ($C^{(5)}$).\n\nNow we compute the sum of squares for each carbon AO over all occupied MOs:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{C}\\,2s$: $2 \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{1k})^2 = 2 \\times (1^2) = 2.0$\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_x$: $2 \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{2k})^2 = 2 \\times (0.3)^2 = 2 \\times 0.09 = 0.18$\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_y$: $2 \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{3k})^2 = 2 \\times (0.3)^2 = 2 \\times 0.09 = 0.18$\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z$: $2 \\sum_{k=1}^5 (c_{4k})^2 = 2 \\times (\\sqrt{0.85})^2 = 2 \\times 0.85 = 1.70$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe total gross atomic population on carbon is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 2.0 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 1.70 = 4.06 $$\nThe Mulliken charge $q_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is the difference between the valence nuclear charge $Z_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{val}}$ and the gross atomic population $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$. With $Z_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{val}} = 4$:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{C}} = Z_{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{val}} - N_{\\mathrm{C}} = 4 - 4.06 = -0.06 $$\nFor completeness, we verify the calculation for oxygen. The AOs on oxygen are $\\mu = 5, 6, 7, 8$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{O}\\,2s$ (AO 5): $2 \\times (c_{51})^2 = 2 \\times 1^2 = 2.0$\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{O}\\,2p_x$ (AO 6): $2 \\times (c_{63})^2 = 2 \\times (\\sqrt{0.91})^2 = 2 \\times 0.91 = 1.82$\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{O}\\,2p_y$ (AO 7): $2 \\times (c_{74})^2 = 2 \\times (\\sqrt{0.91})^2 = 2 \\times 0.91 = 1.82$\n    \\item Population on $\\mathrm{O}\\,2p_z$ (AO 8): $2 \\times (c_{85})^2 = 2 \\times (\\sqrt{0.15})^2 = 2 \\times 0.15 = 0.30$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe gross atomic population on oxygen is:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{O}} = 2.0 + 1.82 + 1.82 + 0.30 = 5.94 $$\nThe charge on oxygen is $q_{\\mathrm{O}} = Z_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\mathrm{val}} - N_{\\mathrm{O}} = 6 - 5.94 = +0.06$.\nThe sum of charges is $q_{\\mathrm{C}} + q_{\\mathrm{O}} = -0.06 + 0.06 = 0$, as required for a neutral molecule. The total electron count is $N_{\\mathrm{C}} + N_{\\mathrm{O}} = 4.06 + 5.94 = 10.00$, which is correct. The calculated charge on carbon is $q_{\\mathrm{C}} = -0.06\\,e$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a rationalization of the small experimental dipole moment oriented as $\\mathrm{C}^{\\delta-}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{O}^{\\delta+}$.\nThe calculated Mulliken charge $q_{\\mathrm{C}} = -0.06\\,e$ is small in magnitude and negative, consistent with the observed polarity $\\mathrm{C}^{\\delta-}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{O}^{\\delta+}$. This result, which contradicts the simple argument based on electronegativity ($\\mathrm{O}$ is more electronegative than $\\mathrm{C}$), can be explained by examining the contributions of the individual MOs to the charge distribution.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The two degenerate $1\\pi$ bonding orbitals are heavily polarized toward oxygen. They contribute a total of $2 \\times (0.18) = 0.36$ electrons to carbon's population, but $2 \\times (1.82) = 3.64$ electrons to oxygen's population. This effect, along with the $3\\sigma$ orbital (purely on $\\mathrm{O}$ in this model, contributing $2.0$ electrons), strongly pulls electron density toward oxygen, creating a tendency for a $\\mathrm{C}^{\\delta+}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{O}^{\\delta-}$ dipole.\n    \\item However, this polarization is counteracted by the $\\sigma$ orbitals. The $4\\sigma$ orbital (purely on $\\mathrm{C}$ in this model) localizes $2.0$ electrons on carbon.\n    \\item The decisive factor is the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the $5\\sigma$ orbital. According to the given coefficients, this orbital is strongly polarized toward *carbon*. It contributes $1.70$ electrons to carbon's population versus only $0.30$ electrons to oxygen's. This substantial accumulation of electron density on the carbon atom from the HOMO is large enough to offset and slightly overcome the opposing polarization from the $\\pi$ system.\n\\end{enumerate}\nIn summary, the small net dipole moment of $\\mathrm{CO}$ and its counter-intuitive direction are the result of a near cancellation of large, opposing electronic polarizations. The strong polarization of the $5\\sigma$ HOMO toward carbon is the key feature that explains why carbon bears a small negative charge.\n\nThe final numerical answer for the Mulliken charge on carbon, $q_{\\mathrm{C}}$, is $-0.06$. Rounded to four significant figures as requested, this is $-0.06000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.06000}\n$$", "id": "2905634"}]}
