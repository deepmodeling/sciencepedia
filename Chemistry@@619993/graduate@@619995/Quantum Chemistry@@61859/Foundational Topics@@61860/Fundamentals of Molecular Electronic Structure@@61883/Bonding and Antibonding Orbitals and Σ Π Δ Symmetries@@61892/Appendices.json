The application to the $\\text{C}_{2}$ molecule is a classic and non-trivial topic in quantum chemistry concerning the nature of its chemical bond.\n\nThe problem is well-posed and objective. All necessary data (occupation numbers, overlap integrals) and definitions are provided explicitly. The tasks are specified with mathematical precision and lead to a unique, verifiable numerical result. The model is a simplification, but it retains physical realism; the occupation numbers and overlap values are plausible. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Task 1: $\\sigma$-Bond-Order-by-Occupation, $ B_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{occ})} $**\n\nThe bond order is defined as half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals. For a homonuclear diatomic molecule along the $z$-axis, molecular orbitals with $\\sigma_{g}$ symmetry constructed from $s$ or $p_{z}$ atomic orbitals are bonding, while those with $\\sigma_{u}$ symmetry are antibonding.\n\nThe total number of electrons in $\\sigma$-bonding orbitals, $N_{\\text{bond}}$, is the sum of occupations of all $\\sigma_{g}$ orbitals:\n$$ N_{\\text{bond}} = n[\\sigma_{g}(2s)] + n[\\sigma_{g}(2p_{z})] $$\nThe total number of electrons in $\\sigma$-antibonding orbitals, $N_{\\text{antibond}}$, is the sum of occupations of all $\\sigma_{u}$ orbitals:\n$$ N_{\\text{antibond}} = n[\\sigma_{u}(2s)] + n[\\sigma_{u}(2p_{z})] $$\nThe general expression for the $\\sigma$-bond-order-by-occupation is therefore:\n$$ B_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{occ})} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_{\\text{bond}} - N_{\\text{antibond}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (n[\\sigma_{g}(2s)] + n[\\sigma_{g}(2p_{z})]) - (n[\\sigma_{u}(2s)] + n[\\sigma_{u}(2p_{z})]) \\right] $$\nWe evaluate this for Model C using the provided occupations:\n$n[\\sigma_{g}(2s)] = 1.84$, $n[\\sigma_{u}(2s)] = 1.16$, $n[\\sigma_{g}(2p_{z})] = 0.72$, $n[\\sigma_{u}(2p_{z})] = 0.28$.\n\n$$ B_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{occ})}(\\mathrm{C}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (1.84 + 0.72) - (1.16 + 0.28) \\right] $$\n$$ B_{\\sigma}^{(\\mathrm{occ})}(\\mathrm{C}) = \\frac{1}{2} [2.56 - 1.44] = \\frac{1}{2} [1.12] = 0.56 $$\n\n**Task 2: $\\sigma$-Overlap Population, $ O_{\\sigma} $**\n\nFirst, we derive the contributions to the Mulliken overlap population. Consider two normalized but not orthogonal atomic orbitals, $\\phi_{A}$ and $\\phi_{B}$, with overlap integral $S = \\langle \\phi_{A} | \\phi_{B} \\rangle$. They form a bonding ($\\psi_g$) and an antibonding ($\\psi_u$) molecular orbital:\n$$ \\psi_{g} = N_{g}(\\phi_{A} + \\phi_{B}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\psi_{u} = N_{u}(\\phi_{A} - \\phi_{B}) $$\nNormalization requires $\\langle \\psi_{i} | \\psi_{i} \\rangle = 1$, which yields the normalization constants:\n$$ N_{g} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S)}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N_{u} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S)}} $$\nThe Mulliken overlap population between atoms $A$ and $B$ for a set of MOs is given by $O_{AB} = \\sum_{i} n_{i} \\sum_{k \\in A} \\sum_{l \\in B} 2 c_{ik}^* c_{il} S_{kl}$. For our two-orbital system, this simplifies. For a single MO $\\psi_i = c_{iA}\\phi_A + c_{iB}\\phi_B$, the contribution to the overlap population is $O_i = n_i (2 c_{iA}^* c_{iB} S)$.\n\nFor the bonding orbital $\\psi_g$, the coefficients are $c_{gA} = c_{gB} = N_g$. Its contribution to the overlap population, for an occupation $n_g$, is:\n$$ O_{g} = n_{g} (2 N_{g}^2 S) = n_{g} \\left( 2 \\frac{1}{2(1+S)} S \\right) = n_{g} \\frac{S}{1+S} $$\nFor the antibonding orbital $\\psi_u$, the coefficients are $c_{uA} = N_u$ and $c_{uB} = -N_u$. Its contribution, for an occupation $n_u$, is:\n$$ O_{u} = n_{u} (2 (N_{u})(-N_{u}) S) = n_{u} \\left( -2 N_{u}^2 S \\right) = n_{u} \\left( -2 \\frac{1}{2(1-S)} S \\right) = -n_{u} \\frac{S}{1-S} $$\nThe total overlap population for this pair of AOs is the sum of contributions from the MOs they form:\n$$ O = O_{g} + O_{u} = n_{g}\\frac{S}{1+S} - n_{u}\\frac{S}{1-S} = S \\left( \\frac{n_g}{1+S} - \\frac{n_u}{1-S} \\right) $$\nUnder the assumption of no $s-p$ cross-terms, the total $\\sigma$-overlap population $O_{\\sigma}$ is the sum of the populations from the $2s$ block and the $2p_z$ block. This directly yields the expression provided in the problem statement:\n$$ O_{\\sigma} = S_{s}\\left(\\frac{n[\\sigma_{g}(2s)]}{1+S_{s}} - \\frac{n[\\sigma_{u}(2s)]}{1-S_{s}}\\right) + S_{p}\\left(\\frac{n[\\sigma_{g}(2p_{z})]}{1+S_{p}} - \\frac{n[\\sigma_{u}(2p_{z})]}{1-S_{p}}\\right) $$\nThe derivation is successful.
