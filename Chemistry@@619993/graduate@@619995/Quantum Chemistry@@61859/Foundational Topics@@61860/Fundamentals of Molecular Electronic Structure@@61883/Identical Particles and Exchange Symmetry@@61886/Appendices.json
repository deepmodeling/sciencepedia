The solution must be derived from fundamental principles, namely the indistinguishability of electrons and the Pauli exclusion principle, which mandates that the total electronic wavefunction be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons.\n\nAn electron in a $p$-subshell is characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ and spin quantum number $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. The number of available single-particle states, or spin-orbitals, in this subshell is given by $2(2l+1)$. For $l=1$, this is $2(2(1)+1) = 6$.

The state $(M_L=2, M_S=\\frac{1}{2})$ corresponds to the occupation $\\{(1, \\frac{1}{2}), (1, -\\frac{1}{2}), (0, \\frac{1}{2})\\}$, where two electrons in the $m_l=1$ orbital must have opposite spins.\n\nWe identify the allowed $LS$ terms by systematically accounting for all microstates in this table.\n\n1.  The highest value of $M_S$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$. This signifies the presence of a term with total spin $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ (a quartet). This maximum $M_S$ value appears only for $M_L=0$. Thus, the highest possible $M_L$ associated with this spin is $0$, which implies $L=0$. This identifies the first term as ${}^4S$. A term with $L=0$ and $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ has a total degeneracy of $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(\\frac{3}{2})+1)(2(0)+1) = 4 \\times 1 = 4$. This term accounts for one microstate at each value of $M_S = \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2}$, all with $M_L=0$. Subtracting these $4$ states leaves the following table of remaining microstates:\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n$M_L \\setminus M_S$ & $\\frac{3}{2}$ & $\\frac{1}{2}$ & $-\\frac{1}{2}$ & $-\\frac{3}{2}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$2$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\\\\n$1$ & $0$ & $2$ & $2$ & $0$ \\\\\n$0$ & $0$ & $2$ & $2$ & $0$ \\\\\n$-1$ & $0$ & $2$ & $2$ & $0$ \\\\\n$-2$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\n2.  In the remaining table, the highest value of $M_L$ is $2$. This must be the maximum $M_L$ component of a new term, corresponding to $L=2$ (a $D$ term). This $M_L=2$ state appears with $M_S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}$. The maximum $M_S$ in the remaining table is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so this term must have $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ (a doublet). This identifies the second term as ${}^2D$. A term with $L=2$ and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ requires one microstate for each combination of $M_L \\in \\{-2, \\dots, 2\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\}$. The total degeneracy is $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(\\frac{1}{2})+1)(2(2)+1) = 2 \\times 5 = 10$. The table confirms that a sufficient number of microstates is available. Subtracting these $10$ states leaves:\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n$M_L \\setminus M_S$ & $\\frac{3}{2}$ & $\\frac{1}{2}$ & $-\\frac{1}{2}$ & $-\\frac{3}{2}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n$2$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\\\\n$1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\\\\n$0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\\\\n$-1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\\\\n$-2$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\n3.  Finally, the remaining microstates have a maximum $M_L=1$, which implies a term with $L=1$ (a $P$ term). The associated $M_S$ values are $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}$, implying $S=\\frac{1}{2}$. This identifies the final term as ${}^2P$. This term has a degeneracy of $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(\\frac{1}{2})+1)(2(1)+1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$. These are exactly the $6$ microstates remaining in the table. After accounting for this term, no microstates remain.\n\nThe allowed $LS$ terms for the $p^3$ configuration are therefore ${}^4S$, ${}^2D$, and ${}^2P$. The sum of their degeneracies is $4 + 10 + 6 = 20$, which matches the total number of microstates calculated from the Pauli principle, confirming the enumeration is complete. The absence of further multiplicity for these terms is a direct consequence of the electrons being equivalent; the antisymmetry constraint uniquely determines the allowed set of total $L$ and $S$ values. For inequivalent electrons, more terms would be possible, and some might appear with multiplicities greater than one.\n\nTo identify the ground term, we apply Hund's rules.\n1.  **First Rule (Maximum Spin Multiplicity):** The ground term has the maximum possible total spin $S$. The allowed terms have $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ (${}^4S$) and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ (${}^2D$, ${}^2P$). The maximum spin is $S=\\frac{3}{2}$, so the ground term is ${}^4S$.\n2.  **Consistency Check:** The $p^3$ configuration represents a half-filled subshell. To maximize spin according to Hund's first rule, each of the three spatial orbitals ($m_l=-1, 0, 1$) must be singly occupied, with all electron spins parallel (e.g., $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$). For such a configuration, the total magnetic orbital quantum number is $M_L = (-1) + (0) + (1) = 0$. Since this is the only way to arrange the electrons to achieve maximum spin, the maximum value of $M_L$ for this spin state is $0$, which implies $L=0$. The total magnetic spin quantum number is $M_S = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$, implying $S=\\frac{3}{2}$. This qualitative reasoning predicts the ground term to be ${}^4S$, in perfect agreement with our detailed microstate analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of distinct microstates. This was determined from first principles via combinatorial analysis conditioned by the Pauli exclusion principle, and subsequently verified by summing the degeneracies of the derived spectroscopic terms. The total number is $20$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20}\n$$", "id": "2897815"}]}
