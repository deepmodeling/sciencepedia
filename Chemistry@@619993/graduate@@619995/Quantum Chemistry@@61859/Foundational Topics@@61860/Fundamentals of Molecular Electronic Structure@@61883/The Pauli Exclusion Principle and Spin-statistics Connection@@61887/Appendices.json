No rounding is required, and no units are needed in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a fundamental, well-posed question in quantum chemistry that is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nThe system under consideration is a many-electron atom described within the independent-particle model, where relativistic effects and external fields are neglected. In this framework, each electron occupies a specific quantum state known as a spin-orbital. A spin-orbital is uniquely identified by a set of four quantum numbers: the principal quantum number $n$, the orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\ell$, the magnetic quantum number $m$, and the spin projection quantum number $m_s$.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of distinct spin-orbitals within a subshell. A subshell is defined as the collection of all orbitals that share the same values for the quantum numbers $n$ and $\\ell$. We are tasked with finding this number, denoted $D(\\ell)$, as a function of $\\ell$.\n\nFirst, we consider the spatial part of the wavefunction, which is described by the quantum numbers $n$, $\\ell$, and $m$. For a fixed orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\ell$, where $\\ell$ is a non-negative integer ($0, 1, 2, \\dots$), the magnetic quantum number $m$ is constrained by the rules of quantum mechanics to take on integer values in the range:\n$$-\\ell \\le m \\le +\\ell$$\nThe number of possible integer values for $m$ is the count of integers from $-\\ell$ to $+\\ell$, inclusive. This count is given by $(\\ell) - (-\\ell) + 1$, which simplifies to $2\\ell + 1$. Each of these values corresponds to a distinct spatial orbital, $\\psi_{n,\\ell,m}(\\vec{r})$. Thus, for a given $\\ell$, there are $2\\ell + 1$ degenerate spatial orbitals.\n\nSecond, we consider the spin degree of freedom. An electron is a fermion with an intrinsic spin angular momentum characterized by the spin quantum number $s = 1/2$. The projection of this spin onto a chosen quantization axis (conventionally the z-axis) is given by the spin projection quantum number $m_s$. The allowed values for $m_s$ range from $-s$ to $s$ in integer steps. For an electron with $s = 1/2$, these values are:\n$$m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis results in exactly two possible spin states for any electron, regardless of its spatial state. The number of distinct spin states is $2s + 1 = 2(1/2) + 1 = 2$.\n\nA spin-orbital, $\\phi_{n,\\ell,m,m_s}$, is a complete single-particle state and is formed by the product of a spatial orbital and a spin function. Since the spatial and spin degrees of freedom are independent in this non-relativistic model, the total number of distinct spin-orbitals within the $(n, \\ell)$ subshell is the product of the number of available spatial orbitals and the number of available spin states.\n\nThe total number of distinct spin-orbitals, $D(\\ell)$, is therefore:\n$$D(\\ell) = (\\text{Number of allowed } m \\text{ values}) \\times (\\text{Number of allowed } m_s \\text{ values})$$\nSubstituting the counts we derived:\n$$D(\\ell) = (2\\ell + 1) \\times 2$$\n\nThe spin-statistics theorem dictates that a system of identical fermions must have a total wavefunction that is antisymmetric under the exchange of any two particles. A direct consequence of this is the Pauli exclusion principle, which, in the context of an independent-particle description of an atom, states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. This means no two electrons can possess the same set of four quantum numbers $(n, \\ell, m, m_s)$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of electrons that can simultaneously occupy a given subshell $(n, \\ell)$ is equal to the total number of distinct spin-orbitals available within that subshell. This maximum number is $D(\\ell)$. The closed-form analytic expression for this quantity in terms of $\\ell$ is:\n$$D(\\ell) = 2(2\\ell + 1)$$\nThis result is fundamental to understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2(2\\ell + 1)}\n$$", "id": "2931145"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple state counting, the spin-statistics connection has profound energetic consequences that dictate chemical behavior.
