It is scientifically grounded, describing a standard and fundamental model of static disorder in single-molecule kinetics. It is well-posed, providing all necessary information and definitions to derive a unique analytical solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The verdict is that the problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the event that the molecule belongs to subpopulation $i$ be denoted by $C_i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. We are given $\\Pr(C_1) = \\alpha$ and $\\Pr(C_2) = 1-\\alpha$.\n\nThe waiting time $T$ for a first-order process with rate constant $k$ follows an exponential distribution. The conditional probability density function (PDF) of the waiting time $T$, given that the molecule is in subpopulation $i$, is therefore:\n$$ p(t | C_1) = k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) $$\n$$ p(t | C_2) = k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t) $$\nfor $t \\ge 0$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall waiting-time PDF, $p(t)$, is the weighted sum of the conditional PDFs:\n$$ p(t) = p(t | C_1) \\Pr(C_1) + p(t | C_2) \\Pr(C_2) $$\nSubstituting the known expressions, we obtain the PDF for this static mixture:\n$$ p(t) = \\alpha k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) + (1-\\alpha) k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t) $$\nThis distribution is a biexponential mixture.\n\nNext, we derive the survival function $S(t) = \\Pr(Tt)$. This can be found either by integrating $p(t)$ from $t$ to $\\infty$, or more directly by applying the law of total probability to the conditional survival functions. The conditional survival function for an exponential distribution with rate $k$ is $S(t|k) = \\exp(-kt)$.\nTherefore:\n$$ S(t | C_1) = \\exp(-k_1 t) $$\n$$ S(t | C_2) = \\exp(-k_2 t) $$\nThe overall survival function is:\n$$ S(t) = \\Pr(Tt | C_1) \\Pr(C_1) + \\Pr(Tt | C_2) \\Pr(C_2) $$\n$$ S(t) = S(t | C_1) \\alpha + S(t | C_2) (1-\\alpha) $$\nSubstituting the expressions gives:\n$$ S(t) = \\alpha \\exp(-k_1 t) + (1-\\alpha) \\exp(-k_2 t) $$\n\nFinally, we derive the hazard rate, $h(t)$, using its definition $h(t) = p(t) / S(t)$. Substituting the expressions for $p(t)$ and $S(t)$:\n$$ h(t) = \\frac{\\alpha k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) + (1-\\alpha) k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t)}{\\alpha \\exp(-k_1 t) + (1-\\alpha) \\exp(-k_2 t)} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the hazard rate.\n\nTo understand how this reveals static heterogeneity, we analyze the time dependence of $h(t)$ when $k_1 \\neq k_2$.\nFor a single, homogeneous population (e.g., $\\alpha=1$ or $k_1=k_2=k$), the hazard rate is constant: $h(t)=k$. This signifies a memoryless process where the instantaneous probability of an event is independent of time.\nFor the heterogeneous mixture, $h(t)$ is not constant. Let us examine its behavior at $t=0$ and as $t \\to \\infty$.\nAt $t=0$:\n$$ h(0) = \\frac{\\alpha k_1 \\exp(0) + (1-\\alpha) k_2 \\exp(0)}{\\alpha \\exp(0) + (1-\\alpha) \\exp(0)} = \\frac{\\alpha k_1 + (1-\\alpha) k_2}{\\alpha + 1 - \\alpha} = \\alpha k_1 + (1-\\alpha) k_2 $$\nThe initial hazard rate is the weighted average of the individual rate constants.\n\nAs $t \\to \\infty$:\nAssume, without loss of generality, that $k_1 > k_2$. The term $\\exp(-k_1 t)$ will decay to zero much faster than $\\exp(-k_2 t)$. To see the limit, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-k_2 t)$:\n$$ h(t) = \\frac{\\alpha k_1 \\exp(-(k_1 - k_2)t) + (1-\\alpha) k_2}{\\alpha \\exp(-(k_1 - k_2)t) + (1-\\alpha)} $$\nSince $k_1 - k_2 > 0$, the term $\\exp(-(k_1 - k_2)t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} h(t) = \\frac{0 + (1-\\alpha) k_2}{0 + (1-\\alpha)} = k_2 $$\nThe hazard rate decreases over time from the average rate $\\alpha k_1 + (1-\\alpha) k_2$ to the rate constant of the slower subpopulation, $k_2 = \\min(k_1, k_2)$.\n\nThis time dependence is the key signature of static heterogeneity. At early times, transitions from both fast ($k_1$) and slow ($k_2$) subpopulations contribute to the observed rate. As time progresses, the faster subpopulation is preferentially depleted because its members undergo transitions more quickly. At long times, the remaining population of molecules consists almost entirely of members of the slower subpopulation. The observed rate thus decreases and asymptotically approaches the slowest rate in the mixture. This phenomenon, which would not be present for a single homogeneous population, directly reveals the underlying static distribution of rate constants.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\alpha k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) + (1-\\alpha) k_2 \\exp(-k_2 t)}{\\alpha \\exp(-k_1 t) + (1-\\alpha) \\exp(-k_2 t)} } $$", "id": "2667784"}, {"introduction": "A realistic model of a single-molecule experiment must account for all competing kinetic pathways, including the eventual demise of the signal.

A photon is emitted only upon a radiative decay $E \\to G$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$. The process terminates upon photobleaching $E \\to B$ with rate $k_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\nEach time the molecule is excited to state $E$, it faces three mutually exclusive decay pathways. This can be viewed as a sequence of trials, where each trial corresponds to one excitation event $G \\to E$. The outcome of a trial is determined by the subsequent decay from $E$.\nThe possible outcomes of a decay from $E$ are:\n- Radiative decay ($E \\to G$): \"Success\" for photon counting. Probability $p_S = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{r}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}}$.\n- Non-radiative decay ($E \\to G$): \"Neutral\" outcome. Probability $p_F = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{nr}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}}$.\n- Photobleaching ($E \\to B$): \"Terminal Failure\". Probability $p_B = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{b}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}}$.\n\nThe process of photon accumulation continues as long as the outcome is either radiative or non-radiative decay, both of which return the molecule to state $G$, allowing for another excitation. The process stops at the first occurrence of photobleaching. The problem asks for the probability of observing exactly $n$ successes ($S$) before the first terminal failure ($B$).\n\nThe rates $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{nr}}$ are irrelevant to this counting problem. The rate $k_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ only influences the time at which excitations occur, not the sequence of outcomes. The non-radiative decay events $F$ are also irrelevant because they neither contribute to the photon count $N$ nor terminate the process. We can therefore reason by conditioning on the \"consequential\" events: a radiative decay ($S$) or a bleaching event ($B$).\n\nGiven the system is in state $E$, the probability that the next consequential event is a radiative decay is the rate of that process divided by the sum of rates of all consequential processes:\n$$ p = P(S | S \\cup B) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{r}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}} $$\nSimilarly, the probability that the next consequential event is photobleaching is:\n$$ 1-p = P(B | S \\cup B) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{b}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}} $$\nThe problem is now transformed into determining the probability of achieving $n$ \"successes\" (photons) before the first \"failure\" (bleaching) in a sequence of Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$. This is described by a geometric distribution.\nThe event $\\{N=n\\}$ corresponds to a sequence of $n$ successful photon emissions, followed by one terminating bleaching event. The probability for this sequence is:\n$$ P(N=n) = p^n (1-p) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p$ and $1-p$:\n$$ P(N=n) = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{r}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right)^n \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{b}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression can be written as:\n$$ P(N=n) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{b}} k_{\\mathrm{r}}^n}{(k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{b}})^{n+1}} $$\nThis is the probability mass function for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.

The $B$ dwell durations (in seconds) are $0.21,\\,0.44,\\,0.19,\\,0.55,\\,0.36,\\,0.27,\\,0.40$, all complete.\n\n- The number of complete $A$ dwells equals the number of $A \\to B$ transitions: since there are $7$ complete $B$ dwells separated by entries from $A$, and the trajectory starts in $A$ and ends in $A$, we have $N_{AB} \\;=\\; 7$ and $N_{BA} \\;=\\; 7$.\n- The total exposure in $A$ is the sum of all $A$ dwells, including the censored final dwell:\n$$\nT_{A} \\;=\\; (0.41 + 0.88 + 0.35 + 0.77 + 0.62 + 0.55 + 0.49 + 0.93)\\,\\mathrm{s} \\;=\\; 5.00\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\n- The total exposure in $B$ is\n$$\nT_{B} \\;=\\; (0.21 + 0.44 + 0.19 + 0.55 + 0.36 + 0.27 + 0.40)\\,\\mathrm{s} \\;=\\; 2.42\\,\\mathrm{s}.\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\hat{k}_{AB} \\;=\\; \\frac{N_{AB}}{T_{A}} \\;=\\; \\frac{7}{5.00}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\;=\\; 1.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1},\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{k}_{BA} \\;=\\; \\frac{N_{BA}}{T_{B}} \\;=\\; \\frac{7}{2.42}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\;\\approx\\; 2.892561983\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, these are $1.400$ and $2.893$, reported in the order $\\hat{k}_{AB}$, $\\hat{k}_{BA}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1.400  2.893\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2667815"}]}
