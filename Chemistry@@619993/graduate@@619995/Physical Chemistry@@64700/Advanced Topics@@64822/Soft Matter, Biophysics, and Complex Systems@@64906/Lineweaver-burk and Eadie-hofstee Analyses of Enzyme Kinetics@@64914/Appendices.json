A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the initial rate of reaction $v$ as a function of the substrate concentration $[S]$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_M + [S]}\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum reaction rate and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe problem requires a linearization of this equation corresponding to a plot of $v$ versus $v/[S]$. This representation is known as the Eadie–Hofstee plot. To derive this form, we manipulate the Michaelis–Menten equation algebraically. First, multiply both sides by $(K_M + [S])$:\n$$\nv(K_M + [S]) = V_{\\max} [S]\n$$\nDistribute the term $v$ on the left-hand side:\n$$\nv K_M + v [S] = V_{\\max} [S]\n$$\nTo create the variable $v/[S]$, we divide the entire equation by $[S]$ (assuming $[S] \\neq 0$, which is required for any reaction to occur):\n$$\n\\frac{v K_M}{[S]} + v = V_{\\max}\n$$\nRearranging this equation to match the standard linear form $y = mx + c$, where the ordinate $y$ is $v$ and the abscissa $x$ is $v/[S]$:\n$$\nv = -K_M \\left(\\frac{v}{[S]}\\right) + V_{\\max}\n$$\nThis is the Eadie–Hofstee equation. By comparing this to the general linear equation $y = mx + c$, we can identify the slope and intercepts:\n- The dependent variable (ordinate) is $y = v$.\n- The independent variable (abscissa) is $x = \\frac{v}{[S]}$.\n- The slope is $m = -K_M$.\n- The $y$-intercept (the value of $y$ when $x=0$) is $c = V_{\\max}$.\n- The $x$-intercept (the value of $x$ when $y=0$) is found by setting $v=0$ in the linear equation: $0 = -K_M x + V_{\\max}$, which gives $x = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_M}$.

The Michaelis–Menten equation is\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant. The Lineweaver-Burk variables are defined as $x = 1/[S]$ and $y = 1/v$.\n\nThe problem states that the uncertainties in the primary measurements, $\\sigma_v$ and $\\sigma_S$, are constant (additive noise).

For a single variable, $\\sigma_{f(z)}^2 \\approx (\\frac{df}{dz})^2 \\sigma_z^2$. We assume the measurements of $[S]$ and $v$ are independent.\n\n**Uncertainty in x-coordinate**\nThe coordinate $x$ is a function only of $[S]$: $x([S]) = 1/[S]$. The propagated standard deviation, $\\sigma_x$, is:\n$$\\sigma_x = \\left| \\frac{dx}{d[S]} \\right| \\sigma_S = \\left| -\\frac{1}{[S]^2} \\right| \\sigma_S = \\frac{\\sigma_S}{[S]^2}$$\nThe relative uncertainty in $x$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_x}{|x|} = \\frac{\\sigma_S/[S]^2}{|1/[S]|} = \\frac{\\sigma_S}{[S]}$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint $\\frac{\\sigma_x}{|x|} \\le \\eta$.

The propagated standard deviation, $\\sigma_y$, is:\n$$\\sigma_y = \\left| \\frac{dy}{dv} \\right| \\sigma_v = \\left| -\\frac{1}{v^2} \\right| \\sigma_v = \\frac{\\sigma_v}{v^2}$$\nThe relative uncertainty in $y$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_y}{|y|} = \\frac{\\sigma_v/v^2}{|1/v|} = \\frac{\\sigma_v}{v}$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint $\\frac{\\sigma_y}{|y|} \\le \\eta$. Substituting the given values $\\sigma_v = 0.02\\,V_{\\max}$ and $\\eta = 0.20$:\n$$\\frac{0.02\\,V_{\\max}}{v} \\le 0.20$$\nThis implies a lower bound on the rate $v$:\n$$v \\ge \\frac{0.02}{0.20} V_{\\max} = 0.1\\,V_{\\max}$$\nNow, we must translate this condition on $v$ into a condition on $[S]$ using the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_M + [S]} \\ge 0.1\\,V_{\\max}$$\nDividing by $V_{\\max}$ (which is a positive constant):\n$$\\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]} \\ge 0.1$$\n$$[S] \\ge 0.1(K_M + [S]) = 0.1\\,K_M + 0.1\\,[S]$$\n$$0.9\\,[S] \\ge 0.1\\,K_M$$\n$$[S] \\ge \\frac{0.1}{0.9} K_M = \\frac{1}{9} K_M$$\nThus, to meet the tolerance for the $y$-coordinate, we must have $[S]/K_M \\ge 1/9 \\approx 0.111$.\n\n**Combined Constraint**\nThe experimental design must satisfy both constraints simultaneously:\n1.  From the $x$-coordinate uncertainty: $[S]/K_M \\ge 0.2$\n2.  From the $y$-coordinate uncertainty: $[S]/K_M \\ge 1/9 \\approx 0.111$\n\nTo satisfy both inequalities, the more restrictive (larger) lower bound must be chosen. Comparing the two bounds, $0.2 > 1/9$. Therefore, the combined condition is:\n$$ \\frac{[S]}{K_M} \\ge 0.2 $$\nThe smallest acceptable lower bound on the ratio $[S]/K_M$ is $0.2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Because the reciprocal transform preserves relative error in $v$, including very low $[S]$ does not degrade LB precision; a reasonable lower bound here is $[S]/K_M \\ge 0.02$.**\nThe statement that the reciprocal transform preserves relative error, $\\sigma_y/|y| = \\sigma_v/v$, is correct. However, the conclusion drawn is incorrect. The relative error in $v$, $\\sigma_v/v$, is not constant. Given a constant $\\sigma_v$, as $[S] \\to 0$, $v \\to 0$, and the relative error $\\sigma_v/v \\to \\infty$. Thus, including very low $[S]$ severely degrades precision. The proposed numerical bound $[S]/K_M \\ge 0.02$ is also incorrect, as our derived bound is $0.2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The reciprocal transform converts additive uncertainties into large absolute uncertainties at small $v$ and small $[S]$, making low-$[S]$ points high-leverage and imprecise; imposing $[S]/K_M \\ge 0.20$ keeps the first-order relative uncertainties in both LB axes $\\le 20\\%$ under the stated noise levels.**\nThe qualitative description is correct. For constant $\\sigma_v$ and $\\sigma_S$, the absolute uncertainties in the LB coordinates are $\\sigma_y = \\sigma_v/v^2$ and $\\sigma_x=\\sigma_S/[S]^2$. Both diverge as $v \\to 0$ and $[S] \\to 0$. Low $[S]$ points correspond to large $x=1/[S]$, making them high-leverage points in a linear regression, and our analysis shows their uncertainties are large. The quantitative claim, that $[S]/K_M \\ge 0.20$ is the required lower bound, precisely matches our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Precision is limited only by uncertainty in $[S]$, so one must require $[S]/K_M \\ge 1.0$ to keep the LB fit stable.**\nThis statement is false. The problem explicitly defines an uncertainty in $v$, $\\sigma_v$, which contributes to the uncertainty of the $y$-coordinate. Both sources of error must be considered. The claim that precision is limited *only* by $\\sigma_S$ is a direct contradiction of the problem statement. Furthermore, the proposed bound $[S]/K_M \\ge 1.0$ is not the minimal bound derived from the premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because $y([S])$ is linear in $1/[S]$, error amplification is symmetric across $[S]$; no lower bound on $[S]/K_M$ is needed provided $[S]$ spans at least one decade.**\nWhile $y$ is linear in $x=1/[S]$, the error amplification is profoundly asymmetric. As shown, the propagated uncertainties $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ both scale inversely with the square of the measured quantities, $[S]^2$ and $v^2$ respectively. This means error is amplified dramatically at low $[S]$ (where $v$ is also low) and suppressed at high $[S]$. The statement of symmetry is factually wrong. Consequently, a lower bound on $[S]$ is essential to control this error, which contradicts the second part of the statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2647799"}]}
