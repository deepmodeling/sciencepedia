It presents a standard exercise in the classical thermodynamics of phase transitions. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the spinodal and binodal compositions for a binary alloy described by the symmetric Landau free-energy density:\n$$\nf(c) = a\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the molar fraction, $a < 0$, and $b > 0$. This form of $f(c)$ describes a double-well potential, which is a necessary condition for phase separation.\n\nFirst, we determine the spinodal interval. A homogeneous single-phase system becomes thermodynamically unstable with respect to infinitesimal composition fluctuations when the free energy curve is locally concave-down. This condition is mathematically expressed by the curvature of the free-energy density, $\\frac{d^{2}f}{dc^{2}} < 0$. The boundary of this unstable region, known as the spinodal, is defined by the condition where the curvature is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}f}{dc^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThese points are the inflection points of the free-energy curve. We compute the first and second derivatives of $f(c)$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ a\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} \\right] = 2a\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}f}{dc^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ 2a\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} \\right] = 2a + 12b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nSetting the second derivative to zero to find the spinodal compositions, denoted $c_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\n2a + 12b\\left(c_{\\mathrm{s}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(c_{\\mathrm{s}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = -\\frac{2a}{12b} = -\\frac{a}{6b}\n$$\nSince $a < 0$ and $b > 0$, the term $-a/(6b)$ is positive, and real solutions exist. Taking the square root, we obtain the two spinodal compositions:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{s}} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}}\n$$\nThus, the spinodal endpoints are:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{s}}^{-} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{\\mathrm{s}}^{+} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the binodal compositions. The binodal line defines the boundary of phase coexistence. Two compositions, $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}$, are in thermodynamic equilibrium if the chemical potentials of each component are equal in both phases. This condition is geometrically equivalent to the \"common-tangent construction\" on the plot of $f(c)$ versus $c$. This requires finding two distinct points $(c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}, f(c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}))$ and $(c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}, f(c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}))$ on the free energy curve that share a common tangent line. This implies two conditions:\n$1$. The slopes at the two points are equal: $\\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}} = \\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}}$.\n$2$. The common slope is equal to the slope of the line connecting the two points: $\\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}} = \\frac{f(c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}) - f(c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-})}{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+} - c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}}$.\n\nThe problem is simplified by the symmetry of the given free-energy function $f(c)$ about $c = \\frac{1}{2}$. For a common tangent to exist for two points $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} < \\frac{1}{2}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+} > \\frac{1}{2}$, they must be symmetric with respect to $c=\\frac{1}{2}$. Let $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\delta$ and $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\delta$ for some $\\delta > 0$.\nThe function $f(c)$ is an even function of the variable $(c-\\frac{1}{2})$, while its derivative, $\\frac{df}{dc}$, is an odd function of $(c-\\frac{1}{2})$.\nThe first condition, $\\frac{df}{dc}\\big|_{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-}} = \\frac{df}{dc}\\big|_{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}}$, becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta} = \\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}\n$$\nDue to the odd symmetry of the derivative, we have $\\frac{df}{dc}\\big|_{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta} = -\\frac{df}{dc}\\big|_{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}$. Substituting this into the equality gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta} = \\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta} \\implies 2\\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta} = 0 \\implies \\frac{df}{dc}\\bigg|_{c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}} = 0\n$$\nThis means that for this symmetric potential, the binodal compositions correspond to the local minima of the free-energy density, where the common tangent is horizontal.\nWe solve $\\frac{df}{dc} = 0$:\n$$\n2a\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left[ a + 2b\\left(c-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis equation has three real roots. One is the trivial root $c=\\frac{1}{2}$, which corresponds to the local maximum between the two wells. The other two roots, which are the binodal compositions, are given by:\n$$\na + 2b\\left(c_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(c_{\\mathrm{b}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = -\\frac{a}{2b}\n$$\nAgain, since $a < 0$ and $b > 0$, the right side is positive. Solving for $c_{\\mathrm{b}}$ gives the binodal endpoints:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compare the widths of the spinodal and binodal intervals. The half-width of the spinodal interval is $\\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}}$. The half-width of the binodal interval (miscibility gap) is $\\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}}$. Since $a<0$ and $b>0$, the quantity $-\\frac{a}{b}$ is positive. We compare $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{6}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} > \\frac{1}{6} \\implies -\\frac{a}{2b} > -\\frac{a}{6b} \\implies \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}} > \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the binodal interval (the miscibility gap) is wider than the spinodal interval. The spinodal compositions lie strictly between the binodal compositions, i.e., $c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} < c_{\\mathrm{s}}^{-} < c_{\\mathrm{s}}^{+} < c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+}$. This is consistent with physical theory, where the region between the binodal and spinodal curves is metastable (requiring nucleation for phase separation), while the region within the spinodal curve is unstable (undergoing spontaneous decomposition).\n\nThe requested four compositions are thus:\n$c_{\\mathrm{s}}^{-} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{s}}^{+} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{-} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{b}}^{+} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}} & \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6b}} & \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}} & \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{2b}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2861309"}, {"introduction": "Having established the thermodynamic boundaries of stability, we now examine the distinct mechanisms by which phase separation initiates.

This expression reveals the qualitative shape of the TTT-like curve:\n- As $T \\to T_{\\mathrm{sp}}(c_0)^-$, the curvature $\\lvert g''\\rvert \\to 0^+$, so $t_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)\\to \\infty$. Thus the curve diverges at the spinodal boundary.\n- As $T$ decreases well below $T_{\\mathrm{sp}}(c_0)$, the thermodynamic driving force $\\lvert g''\\rvert$ increases, but the mobility $M(T)$ decreases exponentially due to activation, causing $t_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$ to increase at sufficiently low $T$.\n- Consequently, $t_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$ has a minimum at an intermediate $T$ within the spinodal, yielding a characteristic $C$-shaped nose in the time–temperature plane. For $T\\ge T_{\\mathrm{sp}}(c_0)$, $\\sigma_{\\max}(T)\\le 0$, no linear amplification occurs, and $t_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is effectively infinite.\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nA.

The regular-solution curvature $g''(c_0,T)=R\\,T\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c_0}+\\dfrac{1}{1-c_0}\\right)-2\\,\\Omega$ is correct. The stated qualitative features (divergence at the spinodal boundary, rise at low $T$ due to small $M$, and a $C$-shape with a nose at intermediate $T$) match the derived behavior. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option omits the factor of $4$ in the numerator (equivalently overestimates $\\sigma_{\\max}$ by a factor of $4$), which arises from the optimal wavenumber $k^{\\ast 2}=\\lvert g''\\rvert/(2\\kappa)$. It also claims monotonic decrease of $t_{\\mathrm{th}}$ with decreasing $T$, neglecting the mobility penalty at low $T$. Both the quantitative expression and qualitative trend are incorrect. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option claims independence from $\\kappa$ and linear rather than quadratic dependence on $\\lvert g''\\rvert$, which contradicts the dispersion relation optimization that yields $\\sigma_{\\max}\\propto \\lvert g''\\rvert^2/\\kappa$. It also asserts a nearly flat curve and abrupt termination, inconsistent with the divergence as $\\lvert g''\\rvert\\to 0$ at the spinodal boundary. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option invokes a classical nucleation barrier $\\Delta G^\\ast(T)$ and an Arrhenius-like incubation time. Spinodal decomposition is barrier-free in the linear regime, governed by amplification of continuous modes rather than discrete nucleation events, and outside the spinodal there is no linear growth, so $t_{\\mathrm{th}}$ does not remain finite. The functional form and qualitative claim are inappropriate. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2507357"}]}
