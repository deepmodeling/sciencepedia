The problem specifies $s$-like ground states, which corresponds to the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=0$. For $l=0$, the angular part is constant and the Schrödinger equation simplifies to its radial component:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d R_{n,0}(r)}{dr} \\right) = E R_{n,0}(r)$$\nLet us introduce an auxiliary function $u(r) = r R_{n,0}(r)$.

First, the wavefunction $R_{n,0}(r) = u(r)/r$ must be finite at $r=0$, which requires $u(0)=0$. This condition implies $B=0$. Second, because the potential is infinite for $r > R$, the wavefunction must be zero at the boundary: $\\psi(R)=0$, which implies $R_{n,0}(R)=0$ and thus $u(R)=0$.

The standard result, $ n-m \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3 $, is equivalent to both of these conditions.\n\n**Part 2: Minimal k-space Distance for (10,5)**\n\nFor the chiral indices $ (n,m) = (10,5) $, we test the condition from Part $1$:\n$$\n2n+m = 2(10) + 5 = 25\n$$\nSince $25$ is not divisible by $3$, no allowed $ \\mathbf{k} $-line passes through a Dirac point. The nanotube is semiconducting. The band gap will be determined by the minimal distance in $ \\mathbf{k} $-space from a Dirac point to the nearest allowed $ \\mathbf{k} $-line. Let this minimal distance be $ q_{min} $.\n\nThe perpendicular distance from a point $ \\mathbf{K} $ to an arbitrary line $ \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_{h} = 2\\pi p $ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta k_{\\perp,p} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_{h} - 2\\pi p|}{|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|} \\left| \\frac{\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_{h}}{2\\pi} - p \\right|\n$$\nSubstituting the result from Part $1$:\n$$\n\\Delta k_{\\perp,p} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|} \\left| \\frac{2n+m}{3} - p \\right|\n$$\nThe minimal distance $ q_{min} $ is found by choosing the integer $ p $ that minimizes this expression. For $ (n,m) = (10,5) $, this is:\n$$\nq_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|} \\min_{p \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\frac{25}{3} - p \\right| = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|} \\min_{p \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| 8 + \\frac{1}{3} - p \\right|\n$$\nThe minimum value is obtained for $p=8$, which gives $ \\frac{1}{3} $. Thus:\n$$\nq_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the magnitude of the chiral vector, $ |\\mathbf{C}_{h}| $. The angle between the graphene primitive lattice vectors $ \\mathbf{a}_{1} $ and $ \\mathbf{a}_{2} $ is $ 60^{\\circ} $ or $ \\pi/3 $ radians. So, $ \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = |\\mathbf{a}_{1}||\\mathbf{a}_{2}|\\cos(\\pi/3) = a^2/2 $.\n$$\n|\\mathbf{C}_{h}|^2 = (n\\mathbf{a}_{1} + m\\mathbf{a}_{2}) \\cdot (n\\mathbf{a}_{1} + m\\mathbf{a}_{2}) = n^2 a^2 + m^2 a^2 + 2nm(\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2}) = a^2(n^2 + m^2 + nm)\n$$\nFor $ (n,m) = (10,5) $:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{C}_{h}| = a\\sqrt{10^2 + 5^2 + (10)(5)} = a\\sqrt{100 + 25 + 50} = a\\sqrt{175} = a\\sqrt{25 \\cdot 7} = 5a\\sqrt{7}\n$$\nThe minimal perpendicular distance is therefore:\n$$\nq_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3(5a\\sqrt{7})} = \\frac{2\\pi}{15a\\sqrt{7}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Band Gap Calculation**\n\nThe low-energy dispersion relation near a Dirac point is linear: $ E(\\mathbf{q}) = \\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}| $, where $ \\mathbf{q} $ is the wavevector measured from the Dirac point. The energy bands of the nanotube are formed by these dispersion surfaces, evaluated only at the allowed $ \\mathbf{k} $-lines. For a semiconducting nanotube, the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are separated by an energy gap $ E_{g} $. This gap corresponds to the energy at the point of closest approach of an allowed $ \\mathbf{k} $-line to a Dirac point. The band gap is twice the energy at this minimum distance, as the valence and conduction bands are symmetric about the Fermi level ($E=0$).\n$$\nE_{g} = 2 E(q_{min}) = 2 \\hbar v_{F} q_{min}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $ q_{min} $ from Part $2$:\n$$\nE_{g} = 2 \\hbar v_{F} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{15a\\sqrt{7}} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar v_{F}}{15a\\sqrt{7}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$ a = 2.46 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m} $\n$ \\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s} $\n$ v_{F} = 1.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $\n$$\nE_{g} = \\frac{4\\pi (1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s}) (1.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})}{15 (2.46 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\sqrt{7}}\n$$\n$$\nE_{g} \\approx 1.35733 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}\n$$\nTo express this in electron-volts (eV), we use the conversion factor $ 1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J} $:\n$$\nE_{g} (\\mathrm{eV}) = \\frac{1.35733 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J/eV}} \\approx 0.84718\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain the final answer.\n$$\nE_{g} \\approx 0.8472\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8472}$$", "id": "2654840"}]}
