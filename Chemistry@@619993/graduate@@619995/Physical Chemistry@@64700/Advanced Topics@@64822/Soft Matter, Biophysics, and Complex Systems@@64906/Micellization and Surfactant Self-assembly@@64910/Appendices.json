The provided data are internally consistent (e.g., both methods yield the same $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$) and have physically realistic magnitudes. The theoretical models cited (Kohlrausch's law, Evans-Wennerstrom model for post-micellar conductivity, Gibbs adsorption isotherm) are the standard frameworks for analyzing such data. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no discernible flaws.\n\n**Verdict and Action:** The problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Correct Parameters**\n\nFirst, the critical micelle concentration is identified from the break in the experimental plots, which is given as $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}} = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the conductivity data to determine the degree of micelle ionization, $\\alpha$.\nIn the premicellar region ($c  c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$), the surfactant is a $1{:}1$ strong electrolyte. The slope $S_1$ is the molar conductivity, which in the dilute limit is the sum of the limiting ionic conductivities of the surfactant anion ($\\lambda_{-}^{\\infty}$) and the counterion ($\\lambda_{+}^{\\infty}$).\n$$ S_1 = \\lambda_{-}^{\\infty} + \\lambda_{+}^{\\infty} $$\nUsing the given data, we can calculate the limiting molar conductivity of the counterion:\n$$ \\lambda_{+}^{\\infty} = S_1 - \\lambda_{-}^{\\infty} = (9.0\\times 10^{-3} - 4.0\\times 10^{-3})\\ \\mathrm{S\\ m^2\\ mol^{-1}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{S\\ m^2\\ mol^{-1}} $$\nIn the post-micellar region ($c  c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$), increasing the total surfactant concentration by $\\mathrm{d}c$ adds surfactant molecules to the micelles. This introduces two contributions to the change in conductivity: from the newly freed counterions and from the charged micelles themselves. The concentration of newly freed counterions is $\\alpha \\mathrm{d}c$, and their contribution to conductivity change is $\\alpha \\lambda_{+}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}c$. The contribution from adding $\\mathrm{d}c$ moles of surfactant into micelles is given as $\\Lambda_m^{*} \\mathrm{d}c$. The slope $S_2$ is the sum of these effects per mole of added surfactant.\n$$ S_2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\kappa}{\\mathrm{d}c} = \\alpha \\lambda_{+}^{\\infty} + \\Lambda_m^{*} $$\nWe solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{S_2 - \\Lambda_m^{*}}{\\lambda_{+}^{\\infty}} = \\frac{1.65\\times 10^{-3} - 5.0\\times 10^{-4}}{5.0\\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1.15\\times 10^{-3}}{5.0\\times 10^{-3}} = 0.23 $$\nThe degree of micelle ionization is $\\alpha = 0.23$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the tensiometry data to find the surface excess, $\\Gamma$, and the area per molecule, $A$.\nThe Gibbs adsorption equation for a $1{:}1$ ionic surfactant in a salt-free solution is:\n$$ \\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{2RT} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma}{\\mathrm{d}\\ln c} $$\nThe factor of $2$ in the denominator arises because one mole of surfactant $\\mathrm{S^-M^+}$ contributes two moles of ions to the solution, and the chemical potential change depends on the product of ion concentrations, leading to $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = 2RT \\mathrm{d}\\ln c$ for the surfactant component.\nUsing the provided data:\n$$ RT = (8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 2477.6\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{2 \\times 2477.6\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}} (-9.75\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{N\\ m^{-1}}) $$\nNoting that $1\\ \\mathrm{J} = 1\\ \\mathrm{N\\ m}$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{9.75\\times 10^{-3}}{4955.2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}} \\approx 1.968 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}} $$\nThe area per molecule, $A$, is given by $A = 1/(N_{\\mathrm{A}}\\Gamma)$.\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{(6.022\\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) \\times (1.968 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}})} $$\n$$ A \\approx 8.44 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{m^2} = 84.4\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2 $$\nThis is a physically reasonable area for a surfactant molecule at an air-water interface.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Identify $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$ from the breaks in $\\kappa(c)$ and $\\gamma(\\ln c)$. Estimate $\\alpha$ as the simple ratio $S_2/S_1$. Compute the surface excess from the slope of $\\gamma$ versus $\\ln c$ using the uncorrected Gibbs adsorption equation for a single neutral solute. Conclude that the resulting molecular area is reasonable.**\n- The method for determining $\\alpha$ as $\\alpha \\approx S_2/S_1 = (1.65\\times 10^{-3})/(9.0\\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 0.18$ is a crude approximation that is physically incorrect as it ignores the different charge carriers.\n- The use of the \"uncorrected\" Gibbs equation means using a factor of $n=1$ instead of the correct $n=2$. This is a fundamental error in applying the theory to an ionic surfactant.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Identify $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$ from the breaks. Estimate $\\alpha$ by subtracting the monomer anion’s limiting molar conductivity from the premicellar slope to get the counterion contribution, and then taking the ratio of the post-critical micelle concentration slope to that counterion contribution, neglecting micellar conductivity. For tensiometry, correct the Gibbs adsorption analysis for ionic dissociation by using the dissociation factor implied by $\\alpha$ when converting the $\\gamma$ slope into a surface excess. Conclude that the resulting molecular area is consistent.**\n- The method for determining $\\alpha$ corresponds to the model $S_2 = \\alpha \\lambda_{+}^{\\infty}$, which neglects the micellar contribution $\\Lambda_m^{*}$. This is an incomplete model, although better than the one in A. It yields $\\alpha = (1.65\\times 10^{-3})/(5.0\\times 10^{-3}) = 0.33$. This protocol fails to use all provided information.\n- The description for the tensiometry analysis is confusing and scientifically unsound. The correction factor for the Gibbs equation in this context is $n=2$ and does not depend on $\\alpha$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Identify $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$ from the breaks. Extract the counterion’s limiting molar conductivity from the premicellar slope by subtracting the known monomer anion contribution. Determine $\\alpha$ in the post-critical micelle concentration regime by attributing the entire incremental conductivity to the sum of the free counterions and the charged micelles, using the provided effective micellar contribution per mole of surfactant in micelles. For tensiometry, convert the $\\gamma$ slope below $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$ into a surface excess using the Gibbs adsorption equation with the appropriate ionic stoichiometry correction enforced by electroneutrality (i.e., the dissociation factor built from the experimentally determined $\\alpha$). From this, obtain a molecular area near $55\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$, consistent with close-packed headgroups.**\n- The protocol for conductivity analysis is entirely correct. It correctly finds $\\lambda_{+}^{\\infty}$ and then proposes using the full model $S_2 = \\alpha \\lambda_{+}^{\\infty} + \\Lambda_m^{*}$ to find $\\alpha$. This is the most accurate method described.\n- The protocol for tensiometry analysis correctly refers to using the \"appropriate ionic stoichiometry correction,\" which for a $1{:}1$ ionic surfactant in salt-free solution means using the factor $n=2$.\n- The parenthetical clause \"(i.e., the dissociation factor built from the experimentally determined $\\alpha$)\" is confusing and physically incorrect, as the factor for the Gibbs equation (applied below the CMC) is independent of the properties of micelles (which exist only above the CMC).\n- The numerical result, \"obtain a molecular area near $55\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$,\" is factually inconsistent with the data provided and the correct application of the Gibbs equation, which yields $A \\approx 84.4\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}^2$.\nDespite the confusing parenthetical and the incorrect numerical value, this is the only option that describes the correct physical-chemical methods for both conductivity and tensiometry. The core of the protocol is sound. The errors are in the explanatory text and the final reported value, not in the fundamental methodology being proposed.\nVerdict: **Correct**. This is the best option among the flawed choices, as it identifies the correct scientific principles.\n\n**D. Identify $c_{\\mathrm{cmc}}$ from the breaks.

Convert the $\\gamma$ slope directly to a surface excess using the neutral-solute form of the Gibbs equation, without any dissociation correction, and accept the resulting molecular area as consistent because it lies within an order of magnitude of typical values.**\n- The conductivity analysis is correct, same as in C.\n- The tensiometry analysis is incorrect. It explicitly states to use the \"neutral-solute form,\" which means a factor of $n=1$, which is wrong for an ionic surfactant. The justification based on being \"within an order of magnitude\" represents poor scientific reasoning.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2650288"}]}
