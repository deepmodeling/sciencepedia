It is well-posed, providing a complete set of equations and constraints necessary for a unique mathematical solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The calculations required are standard procedures in the theory of dynamical systems and are not trivial. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we determine the steady state $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast})$ by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \\implies A - (B+1)x^{\\ast} + (x^{\\ast})^{2} y^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\implies Bx^{\\ast} - (x^{\\ast})^{2} y^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nFrom the second equation, since we seek a positive steady state ($x^{\\ast}  0$), we can factor out $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} (B - x^{\\ast} y^{\\ast}) = 0 \\implies B - x^{\\ast} y^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies (x^{\\ast})^{2} y^{\\ast} = Bx^{\\ast}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the first equation gives:\n$$\nA - (B+1)x^{\\ast} + Bx^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - Bx^{\\ast} - x^{\\ast} + Bx^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - x^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies x^{\\ast} = A\n$$\nNow, using $x^{\\ast} = A$ in the expression for $y^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} y^{\\ast} = B \\implies A y^{\\ast} = B \\implies y^{\\ast} = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThe unique positive steady state is $(x^{\\ast}, y^{\\ast}) = (A, \\frac{B}{A})$.\n\nSecond, we derive the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let the vector field be $F(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} f(x,y) \\\\ g(x,y) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $f(x,y) = A - (B+1)x + x^2y$ and $g(x,y) = Bx - x^2y$.

The system becomes an algebraic one for the perturbation amplitudes:\n$$\n\\sigma u = -2gR^2 u - \\xi k^2 u - 2\\xi R Q (i k_x) v\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma v = \\frac{2\\xi Q}{R} (i k_x) u - \\xi k^2 v\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma + 2gR^2 + \\xi k^2  2i\\xi R Q k_x \\\\ - \\frac{2i\\xi Q k_x}{R}  \\sigma + \\xi k^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution to exist, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. This condition yields the dispersion relation for the growth rate $\\sigma$:\n$$\n(\\sigma + 2gR^2 + \\xi k^2)(\\sigma + \\xi k^2) - (2i\\xi R Q k_x)(-\\frac{2i\\xi Q k_x}{R}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\sigma + \\xi k^2)^2 + 2gR^2(\\sigma + \\xi k^2) - 4\\xi^2 Q^2 k_x^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\sigma$. For a long-wavelength instability, we are interested in the behavior for small $k_x$ and $k_y$. We can find $\\sigma$ by expanding to leading order in $k$. Let's assume $\\sigma$ is also small. Keeping terms up to order $k^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma (2gR^2 + 2\\xi k^2) + (\\xi k^2)^2 + 2gR^2 \\xi k^2 - 4\\xi^2 Q^2 k_x^2 \\approx 0\n$$\nRetaining leading terms, we have $\\sigma(2gR^2) + 2gR^2\\xi k^2 - 4\\xi^2 Q^2 k_x^2 \\approx 0$.\n$$\n\\sigma \\approx \\frac{4\\xi^2 Q^2 k_x^2 - 2gR^2\\xi k^2}{2gR^2} = (\\frac{2\\xi^2 Q^2}{gR^2})k_x^2 - \\xi(k_x^2+k_y^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\xi^2 Q^2}{gR^2} - \\xi \\right) k_x^2 - \\xi k_y^2\n$$\nThe Eckhaus instability corresponds to longitudinal modulations, for which $k_y=0$. The growth rate for these modes is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{Eckhaus} \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\xi^2 Q^2}{gR^2} - \\xi \\right) k_x^2\n$$\nThe stripe pattern is stable if $\\sigma_{Eckhaus}  0$ for all $k_x \\neq 0$. This requires the coefficient of $k_x^2$ to be negative:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\xi^2 Q^2}{gR^2} - \\xi  0 \\implies 2\\xi^2 Q^2  \\xi gR^2 \\implies 2\\xi Q^2  gR^2\n$$\nThis is the general condition for Eckhaus stability. To find the stable band of detunings, we substitute the expression for the amplitude, $gR^2 = \\mu - \\xi Q^2$:\n$$\n2\\xi Q^2  \\mu - \\xi Q^2\n$$\n$$\n3\\xi Q^2  \\mu\n$$\n$$\nQ^2  \\frac{\\mu}{3\\xi}\n$$\nThis inequality defines the range of detunings $Q$ for which the stripe pattern is stable against long-wavelength longitudinal perturbations. The stripes are stable for $-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{3\\xi}}  Q  \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{3\\xi}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the half-width of this stable detuning band, which corresponds to the maximum allowed magnitude of $Q$. This is given by:\n$$\n|Q|_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{3\\xi}}\n$$\nThis result is a classic criterion for the stability of one-dimensional patterns in systems described by the NWS equation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{3\\xi}}}$$", "id": "2665460"}]}
