It does not violate any criteria for invalidity, such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity. The problem is a formalizable and non-trivial exercise in chemical kinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly applying the provided definitions to the two distinct termination mechanisms. Let $[P^\\cdot]$ be the total concentration of growing polymer radicals. The fundamental rates are:\n- Rate of initiation: $R_i$, the rate at which active chains are formed.\n- Rate of propagation: $R_p = k_p [M] [P^\\cdot]$, where $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant and $[M]$ is the monomer concentration. This is the primary mode of monomer consumption.\n- Rate of termination: $R_t = 2 k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$, where $k_t$ is the termination rate constant. The factor of $2$ arises because two radicals are consumed in each bimolecular termination event.\n\nThe steady-state assumption for radical concentration dictates that the rate of radical formation equals the rate of radical destruction:\n$$R_i = R_t$$\nThe kinetic chain length is given as $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_i$. Using the steady-state assumption, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\bar{\\nu} = \\frac{R_p}{R_t}$$\nThe number-average degree of polymerization is defined as $X_n = \\frac{\\text{Rate of monomer consumption}}{\\text{Rate of formation of dead polymer molecules}}$. Given that propagation is the dominant pathway for monomer consumption, we have $X_n \\approx \\frac{R_p}{\\text{Rate of formation of dead polymer molecules}}$. We must now determine the rate of formation of dead polymer molecules for each case.\n\nCase A: Termination by Combination.\nIn this mechanism, two growing radicals combine to form a single, larger, dead polymer molecule.\n$$P_m^\\cdot + P_n^\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} P_{m+n}$$\nEach termination event, which occurs at a rate of $k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$, produces *one* dead polymer molecule. The rate of radical loss is $R_t = 2 k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$. Therefore, the rate of formation of dead polymer molecules is:\n$$(\\text{Rate of dead polymer formation})_{\\mathrm{comb}} = k_t [P^\\cdot]^2 = \\frac{R_t}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $X_n$:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}} = \\frac{R_p}{\\frac{R_t}{2}} = 2 \\frac{R_p}{R_t}$$\nUsing the relation $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_t$, we find the relationship between the degree of polymerization and the kinetic chain length:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}} = 2 \\bar{\\nu}$$\n\nCase B: Termination by Disproportionation.\nIn this mechanism, one radical abstracts an atom (typically hydrogen) from another, resulting in two dead polymer molecules.\n$$P_m^\\cdot + P_n^\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} P_m + P_n'$$\nEach termination event, again occurring at a rate of $k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$, produces *two* dead polymer molecules. The rate of radical loss is still $R_t = 2 k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$. The rate of formation of dead polymer molecules is:\n$$(\\text{Rate of dead polymer formation})_{\\mathrm{disp}} = 2 (k_t [P^\\cdot]^2) = R_t$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $X_n$:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}} = \\frac{R_p}{R_t}$$\nUsing the relation $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_t$, we find:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}} = \\bar{\\nu}$$\n\nNow, we must compute the ratio $M_{n,\\mathrm{comb}}/M_{n,\\mathrm{disp}}$. From the definition $M_n = X_n M_0$, the ratio of molecular weights is identical to the ratio of the degrees of polymerization:\n$$\\frac{M_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{M_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}} M_0}{X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}} M_0} = \\frac{X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the comparison is made for a fixed rate of propagation, $R_p$, and \"otherwise identical conditions.\" \"Identical conditions\" implies that the temperature, initial monomer concentration, and initiation system (initiator type and concentration) are the same for both hypothetical cases. This means the rate of initiation, $R_i$, is identical in both scenarios.\nSince $R_p$ is fixed and $R_i$ is identical for both cases, the kinetic chain length, $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_i$, must also be the same for both cases. Let this common value be $\\bar{\\nu}$.\n\nWe can now compute the required ratio:\n$$\\frac{M_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{M_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{2 \\bar{\\nu}}{\\bar{\\nu}}$$\nThe term $\\bar{\\nu}$ cancels, yielding a pure number.\n$$\\frac{M_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{M_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = 2$$\nThis result is a fundamental consequence of the stoichiometry of the termination reaction.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive an expression for the heat generation rate and the associated amplification factor due to the gel effect. Second, we calculate the maximum adiabatic temperature rise.\n\n**Part 1: Heat Generation Rate and Amplification Factor**\n\nThe rate of polymerization, $R_{p}$, is defined as the rate of monomer consumption. According to mass-action kinetics for chain propagation, this rate is given by:\n$$\nR_{p} = - \\frac{dC_{M}}{dt} = k_{p} C_{M} [R\\cdot]\n$$\nwhere $k_{p}$ is the propagation rate constant, $C_{M}$ is the monomer concentration, and $[R\\cdot]$ is the total concentration of chain radicals.\n\nWe apply the steady-state approximation (SSA) for the radical concentration. This approximation posits that the rate of radical generation is equal to the rate of radical termination. The volumetric initiation rate is given as a constant, $R_{i}$. Termination is a bimolecular process where two radicals are consumed, so the rate of termination is $2k_{t}[R\\cdot]^{2}$. The SSA is thus expressed as:\n$$\nR_{i} = 2 k_{t} [R\\cdot]^{2}\n$$\nFrom this, we solve for the steady-state radical concentration:\n$$\n[R\\cdot] = \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t}} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R\\cdot]$ back into the equation for the rate of polymerization yields:\n$$\nR_{p} = k_{p} C_{M} \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t}} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the heat generation rate per unit volume, $q_{\\mathrm{gen}}$, is equal to the magnitude of the enthalpy released per unit time. The enthalpy of polymerization, $\\Delta H_p$, is given as a negative value. Therefore, the heat released per mole of monomer reacted is $-\\Delta H_p$. The total heat generation rate per unit volume is the product of the polymerization rate and this molar enthalpy change:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{gen}} = R_{p} (-\\Delta H_{p}) = k_{p} C_{M} \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t}} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})\n$$\nWe are given the relations for monomer concentration, $C_{M}(t) = C_{M0}(1-x)$, and the termination rate constant's dependence on conversion, $k_{t}(x) = k_{t0} \\exp(-\\alpha x)$. The rate of polymerization is thus a function of conversion, $x$, and temperature, $T$ (since $k_p$ and $k_{t0}$ are temperature-dependent):\n$$\nR_{p}(x,T) = k_{p}(T) C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0}(T) \\exp(-\\alpha x)} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe heat generation rate with the gel effect, $q_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{gel}}(x,T)$, is therefore:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{gel}}(x,T) = k_{p}(T) C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0}(T) \\exp(-\\alpha x)} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the heat generation rate per unit volume.\n\nTo find the amplification factor $\\mathcal{A}(x)$, we consider the case without the gel effect.

The heat generation rate for the no-gel case is:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{no\\text{-}gel}}(x,T) = k_{p}(T) C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0}(T)} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})\n$$\nThe amplification factor is defined as the ratio of the heat generation rate with the gel effect to that without it, at the same conversion and temperature:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(x) \\equiv \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{gel}}(x)}{q_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{no\\text{-}gel}}(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(x) = \\frac{k_{p} C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0} \\exp(-\\alpha x)} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})}{k_{p} C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0}} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})}\n$$\nAll terms cancel except for the part of the expression related to the gel effect model:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(x) = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{\\exp(-\\alpha x)} \\right)^{1/2}}{(1)^{1/2}} = (\\exp(\\alpha x))^{1/2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the amplification factor.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum Adiabatic Temperature Rise**\n\nFor a perfectly mixed, adiabatic batch reactor with constant density $\\rho$ and specific heat capacity $C_p$, the energy balance is given by:\n$$\n\\rho C_{p} \\frac{dT}{dt} = q_{\\mathrm{gen}}\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature of the reaction mixture.
