Report the exact value of the critical parameter $\\mu$ for the saddle-node bifurcation as your final answer. No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem presents a one-dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equation, $\\dot{x}=\\mu - x + x^{2}$, where $x$ represents a dimensionless concentration and $\\mu$ is a real control parameter. The task is to analyze the equilibria, their stability, and the conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- The differential equation: $\\dot{x}=\\mu - x + x^{2}$\n- The variable: $x$\n- The parameter: $\\mu$\n- Definitions of equilibrium, stability, and saddle-node bifurcation.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a canonical example of a saddle-node bifurcation in nonlinear dynamics, a topic central to physical chemistry. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. No scientific principles are violated, and no essential data are missing. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the analysis.\n\n(i) Determination of Equilibria:\nEquilibria, or steady states, are points $x^*$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $\\dot{x} = 0$. We set the right-hand side of the given differential equation to zero:\n$$x^{2} - x + \\mu = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the equilibrium concentration $x$. We solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=\\mu$.\nThe solutions are:\n$$x_{\\pm}^{*} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}$$\nThese equilibria are real-valued only if the discriminant is non-negative, which imposes a condition on the parameter $\\mu$:\n$$1 - 4\\mu \\ge 0 \\implies 4\\mu \\le 1 \\implies \\mu \\le \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThus, for $\\mu > \\frac{1}{4}$, there are no real equilibria. For $\\mu = \\frac{1}{4}$, there is one equilibrium. For $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$, there are two distinct equilibria:\n$$x_{+}^{*} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}$$\n$$x_{-}^{*} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}$$\n\n(ii) Linear Stability Analysis:\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ for a one-dimensional system $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ is determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx}$ evaluated at $x^*$. The equilibrium is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. The case $f'(x^*) = 0$ corresponds to a non-hyperbolic equilibrium, where linear stability analysis is inconclusive and higher-order terms are required.\n\nThe function is $f(x, \\mu) = \\mu - x + x^{2}$. Its derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu - x + x^{2}) = -1 + 2x$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the two equilibrium points, $x_{+}^{*}$ and $x_{-}^{*}$, for the parameter range $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFor the upper branch equilibrium, $x_{+}^{*}$:\n$$f'(x_{+}^{*}) = -1 + 2 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2} \\right) = -1 + (1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}) = \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}$$\nSince $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$, we have $1 - 4\\mu > 0$, and thus $f'(x_{+}^{*}) > 0$. Therefore, the equilibrium $x_{+}^{*}$ is always unstable.\n\nFor the lower branch equilibrium, $x_{-}^{*}$:\n$$f'(x_{-}^{*}) = -1 + 2 \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2} \\right) = -1 + (1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}) = -\\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}$$\nSince $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$, we have $1 - 4\\mu > 0$, and thus $f'(x_{-}^{*}) < 0$. Therefore, the equilibrium $x_{-}^{*}$ is always stable.\n\n(iii) Saddle-Node Bifurcation Condition:\nA saddle-node bifurcation occurs at a critical parameter value $\\mu_c$ where two equilibria (one stable, one unstable) coalesce and annihilate each other. This event is characterized by the simultaneous fulfillment of two conditions at a point $(x_c, \\mu_c)$:\n1. The equilibrium condition: $f(x_c, \\mu_c) = 0$\n2. The non-hyperbolicity condition (loss of stability): $f'(x_c) = 0$\n\nWe solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns, $x_c$ and $\\mu_c$.\nFrom the second condition:\n$$-1 + 2x_c = 0 \\implies 2x_c = 1 \\implies x_c = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis gives the concentration at the bifurcation point. Now, we substitute this value of $x_c$ into the first condition to find the critical parameter value $\\mu_c$:\n$$f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\mu_c\\right) = \\mu_c - \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = 0$$\n$$\\mu_c - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$$\n$$\\mu_c - \\frac{1}{4} = 0$$\n$$\\mu_c = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThis result confirms the condition derived from the discriminant of the quadratic equation. At $\\mu = \\frac{1}{4}$, the two equilibria $x_{+}^{*}$ and $x_{-}^{*}$ coalesce into a single equilibrium point $x^* = \\frac{1}{2}$. At this point, the derivative is $f'(\\frac{1}{2}) = -1 + 2(\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$, confirming the loss of hyperbolicity. For $\\mu > \\frac{1}{4}$, the equilibria vanish. This is the definition of a saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nThe critical parameter value for the saddle-node bifurcation is $\\mu_c = \\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "2655641"}, {"introduction": "To bridge abstract theory with practical application, we now examine how bistability arises in a chemical reactor.

The approach will follow the specified steps: derivation of the governing differential equations, formulation of the steady-state problem, and application of bifurcation theory.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing mass balances for the species $A$ and $X$. The general mole balance for any species $j$ in an isothermal, constant-volume CSTR is given by:\n$$V \\frac{dc_j}{dt} = F(c_{j, \\mathrm{in}} - c_j) + V R_j$$\nwhere $V$ is the reactor volume, $F$ is the volumetric flow rate, $c_j$ and $c_{j, \\mathrm{in}}$ are the concentrations of species $j$ in the reactor and in the feed, respectively, and $R_j$ is the net rate of formation of species $j$ by chemical reaction.
