A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Rate Equation**\n\nThe initial rate of reaction, $v$, is defined by the rate of product formation. According to the reaction scheme, product $P$ is formed from the enzyme-substrate complex $ES$ with a catalytic rate constant $k_{cat}$.\n$$v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{cat} [ES]$$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate, such that $[ES] \\approx [E]_{T}$. Thus, we define $V_{\\max}$ as:\n$$V_{\\max} = k_{cat} [E]_{T}$$\nThis allows us to express the initial rate $v$ in terms of $V_{\\max}$:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{[E]_{T}} [ES]$$\nTo proceed, we must find an expression for the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$. We apply the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) to the $ES$ complex, meaning its concentration is assumed to be constant over the initial period of the reaction. The rate of change of $[ES]$ is the rate of its formation minus the rate of its breakdown.\n$$\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_{1}[E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES] = 0$$\nwhere $k_{1}$ and $k_{-1}$ are the forward and reverse rate constants for substrate binding, respectively. Rearranging this gives:\n$$k_{1}[E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{cat})[ES]$$\nBy the Briggs–Haldane definition, the Michaelis constant $K_M$ is:\n$$K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{cat}}{k_{1}}$$\nSubstituting $K_M$ into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$K_M[ES] = [E][S]$$\nThis equation relates the concentration of free enzyme $[E]$ to the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex $[ES]$.\n\nNext, we use the rapid equilibrium assumption for the binding of the inhibitor $I$ to the free enzyme $E$. The inhibitor dissociation constant, $K_i$, is given by:\n$$K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, $[EI]$, in terms of $[E]$:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{T}$, is conserved, as given:\n$$[E]_{T} = [E] + [ES] + [EI]$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $[E]$ (from the QSSA result) and $[EI]$ (from the inhibitor equilibrium) into the conservation equation. First, we express $[E]$ in terms of $[ES]$:\n$$[E] = \\frac{K_M[ES]}{[S]}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for $[EI]$:\n$$[EI] = \\frac{1}{K_i} \\left( \\frac{K_M[ES]}{[S]} \\right) [I] = \\frac{K_M[I]}{K_i[S]}[ES]$$\nSubstituting both expressions for $[E]$ and $[EI]$ into the conservation equation gives:\n$$[E]_{T} = \\frac{K_M[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\frac{K_M[I]}{K_i[S]}[ES]$$\nWe can factor out $[ES]$ from the right-hand side:\n$$[E]_{T} = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_M}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{K_M[I]}{K_i[S]} \\right)$$\nRearranging the term in the parenthesis gives:\n$$[E]_{T} = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_M + [S] + \\frac{K_M[I]}{K_i}}{[S]} \\right)$$\n$$[E]_{T} = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}{[S]} \\right)$$\nNow, we can solve for $[ES]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[ES]$ into the initial rate equation, $v = k_{cat}[ES] = \\frac{V_{max}}{[E]_{T}}[ES]$:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{[E]_{T}} \\left( \\frac{[E]_{T}[S]}{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} \\right)$$\nThe $[E]_{T}$ terms cancel, yielding the derived rate equation for competitive inhibition:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nThis is the required expression for the initial rate $v$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $V_{\\max} = 1\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $K_M = 50\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $K_i = 5\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[I] = 10\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[S] = 25\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n\nThe value for $[E]_{T}$ is not required for the calculation since $V_{\\max}$ is provided directly.

The rates of formation and breakdown of $[ES]$ due to substrate binding/unbinding and catalysis are given by the reaction $E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\text{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P$. Since inhibitor binding and dissociation are assumed to be in rapid equilibrium, they do not contribute net flux to the QSSA balance for $[ES]$. Thus, the steady-state condition is:\n$$\\text{Rate of } [ES] \\text{ formation} = \\text{Rate of } [ES] \\text{ breakdown}$$\n$$k_1[E][S] = k_{-1}[ES] + k_{\\text{cat}}[ES] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES]$$\nUsing the definition of the Michaelis constant, $K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}{k_1}$, we can rearrange the QSSA equation to solve for $[ES]$ in terms of $[E]$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}}}[E][S] = \\frac{[E][S]}{K_M}$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $[ES]$ into the grouped conservation equation:\n$$[E]_T = [E]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + \\frac{[E][S]}{K_M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)$$\nWe solve for the free enzyme concentration $[E]$:\n$$[E] = \\frac{[E]_T}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + \\frac{[S]}{K_M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)}$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[E]$ back into the relation $[ES] = \\frac{[E][S]}{K_M}$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[S]}{K_M} \\cdot \\frac{[E]_T}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + \\frac{[S]}{K_M}\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)}$$\nTo simplify this expression, multiply the numerator and denominator by $K_M$:\n$$[ES] = \\frac{[S][E]_T}{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)}$$\nNow, substitute this final expression for $[ES]$ into the rate law $v = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$:\n$$v = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[S][E]_T}{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)}$$\nTo cast this into the standard Michaelis-Menten form $v = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}[S]}{K_M^{\\text{app}} + [S]}$, we divide the numerator and denominator by the term $\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)$:\n$$v = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)} [S]}{\\frac{K_M\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}\\right)} + [S]}$$\nBy comparing this with the target form and using the definition $V_{\\max} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_T$, we identify the apparent parameters:\n$$V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}}$$\n$$K_M^{\\text{app}} = K_M \\frac{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'}}$$\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculation using the given values: $K_M = 20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, $V_{\\max} = 2\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$, $K_i = 10\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, $K_i' = 40\\ \\mu\\text{M}$, and $[I] = 20\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator term for $V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}}$:\n$$1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i'} = 1 + \\frac{20\\ \\mu\\text{M}}{40\\ \\mu\\text{M}} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5$$\nSo, the apparent maximum velocity is:\n$$V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{1.5} = \\frac{2\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}}{1.5} = \\frac{4}{3}\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1} \\approx 1.3333...\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$$\nNext, we calculate the numerator term for the $K_M^{\\text{app}}$ factor:\n$$1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = 1 + \\frac{20\\ \\mu\\text{M}}{10\\ \\mu\\text{M}} = 1 + 2 = 3$$\nSo, the apparent Michaelis constant is:\n$$K_M^{\\text{app}} = K_M \\frac{3}{1.5} = (20\\ \\mu\\text{M}) \\times 2 = 40\\ \\mu\\text{M}$$\nThe problem requires the results to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$K_M^{\\text{app}} = 40.00\\ \\mu\\text{M}$\n$V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}} = 1.333\\ \\mu\\text{M}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(K_M^{\\text{app}},\\, V_{\\max}^{\\text{app}})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 40.00  1.333 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2796859"}]}
