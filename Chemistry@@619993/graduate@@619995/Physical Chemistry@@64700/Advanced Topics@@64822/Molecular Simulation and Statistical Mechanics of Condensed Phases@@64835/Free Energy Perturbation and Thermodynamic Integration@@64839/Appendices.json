It is based on standard principles of classical statistical mechanics and presents a canonical problem readily solvable by established methods.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Helmholtz free energy difference, $\\Delta A$, for a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator when its force constant is changed from $k_{0}$ to $k_{1}$ at constant temperature $T$. We will derive this quantity through three distinct methods as requested.\n\n(a) Exact configurational Helmholtz free energy $A_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T)$\n\nThe configurational partition function $Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}$ for a system with potential energy $U(x;k)$ at temperature $T$ is given by\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U(x;k)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$. For the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x;k) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$. Substituting this into the definition of the partition function gives\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta k x^{2}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^{2}) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. In our case, the constant $a$ is $\\frac{\\beta k}{2}$. Therefore, the integral evaluates to\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{\\beta k}{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k}}\n$$\nThe Helmholtz free energy $A$ is related to the partition function $Z$ by the fundamental equation $A = -k_{B}T \\ln Z = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln Z$. The configurational contribution to the Helmholtz free energy is thus\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(\\sqrt{y}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(y)$, we obtain\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = -\\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\beta k}{2\\pi}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the exact expression for the configurational Helmholtz free energy of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n\n(b) Free energy difference via Thermodynamic Integration (TI)\n\nThermodynamic Integration (TI) provides a method to calculate the free energy difference between two states by integrating the ensemble average of the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to a coupling parameter $\\lambda$. The free energy difference is given by\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\lambda\n$$\nwhere $U_{\\lambda}(x)$ is the potential energy of the system interpolated between state $0$ ($\\lambda=0$) and state $1$ ($\\lambda=1$), and $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_{\\lambda}$ denotes an ensemble average over the system with potential $U_{\\lambda}(x)$.\n\nThe interpolating potential is given as $U_{\\lambda}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k(\\lambda)x^{2}$, with $k(\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1}$. First, we compute the partial derivative of $U_{\\lambda}(x)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}k(\\lambda)}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) x^{2}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the ensemble average of this quantity, $\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\rangle_{\\lambda}$, in the canonical ensemble defined by the potential $U_{\\lambda}(x)$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) x^{2} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) \\langle x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda}$ is the mean-squared displacement of the oscillator with force constant $k(\\lambda)$. For a classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the equipartition theorem states that the average potential energy is $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}k(\\lambda)x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T$. From this, we directly find the mean-squared displacement:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{k(\\lambda)} = \\frac{1}{\\beta k(\\lambda)}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the ensemble average derivative gives\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) \\frac{1}{\\beta k(\\lambda)} = \\frac{k_{1} - k_{0}}{2\\beta((1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1})}\n$$\nNow we can perform the integration over $\\lambda$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{k_{1} - k_{0}}{2\\beta((1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1})} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\lambda\n$$\nLet the denominator be $f(\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1} = k_{0} + \\lambda(k_{1}-k_{0})$. The derivative is $f'(\\lambda) = k_{1} - k_{0}$. The integral is of the form $\\int \\frac{f'(\\lambda)}{f(\\lambda)}\\mathrm{d}\\lambda = \\ln(f(\\lambda))$.\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\left[ \\ln\\left((1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} (\\ln(k_{1}) - \\ln(k_{0})) = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\n(c) Free energy difference via Free Energy Perturbation (FEP)\n\nThe Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) formula, also known as the Zwanzig equation, expresses the free energy difference in terms of an ensemble average of the potential energy difference, taken over a reference state. Choosing the initial state with force constant $k_{0}$ as the reference, the formula is\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_{1} - A_{0} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp\\left(-\\beta (U_{1}(x) - U_{0}(x))\\right) \\right\\rangle_{0}\n$$\nHere, $U_{0}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{0}x^{2}$, $U_{1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{1}x^{2}$, and $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_{0}$ denotes an ensemble average over the reference state $0$. The potential energy difference is $\\Delta U(x) = U_{1}(x) - U_{0}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(k_{1}-k_{0})x^{2}$.\n\nThe ensemble average is computed as\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U(x)) \\right\\rangle_{0} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U(x)) \\exp(-\\beta U_{0}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U_{0}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential in the numerator's integrand is\n$$\n-\\beta \\Delta U(x) - \\beta U_{0}(x) = -\\beta \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(k_{1}-k_{0})x^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{0}x^{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta k_{1}x^{2} = -\\beta U_1(x)\n$$\nThus, the ensemble average is the ratio of two partition functions:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U(x)) \\right\\rangle_{0} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U_{1}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U_{0}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_1, T)}{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_0, T)}\n$$\nUsing the result for $Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}$ from part (a), $Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k}}$, we have\n$$\n\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_1, T)}{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_0, T)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k_{1}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k_{0}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the FEP formula for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nAll three methods—direct calculation from the definition of $A$, thermodynamic integration, and free energy perturbation—yield the identical result, as required by consistency. The final expression for the change in Helmholtz free energy is derived by substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required single, closed-form analytic expression for $\\Delta A$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{0}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2642319"}, {"introduction": "Thermodynamic Integration provides an elegant theoretical path to a free energy difference, but its practical implementation relies on confronting the discrete and noisy nature of simulation data.

Both cycles show statistically insignificant closure deviations, so the observed differences are dominated by random sampling error; no systematic issues are indicated.\n\nC. Both cycles would show the same positive closure offset if a standard-state correction for restraints were neglected; therefore the data point to missing restraint standard-state corrections as the dominant error.\n\nD. The positive closure deviation in Cycle 1, together with the protocol, indicates missing long-range dispersion corrections due to the Lennard-Jones cutoff; enabling an analytical long-range dispersion correction would resolve the bias equally in both cycles.", "solution": "Begin from the definition of the Gibbs free energy $G$ in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble as $G = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln \\Xi$, where $\\Xi$ is the isothermal-isobaric partition function and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Because $G$ is a state function, a consequence is path independence: the line integral of $\\mathrm{d}G$ around any closed loop at fixed $T$ and $p$ vanishes. For a cycle $A\\to B\\to C\\to A$, this implies\n$$\n\\Delta G_{A\\to B} + \\Delta G_{B\\to C} + \\Delta G_{C\\to A} = 0.\n$$\nIn alchemical RBFE, each leg is a difference of two state functions, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{X\\to Y} \\equiv \\Delta G^{\\mathrm{cx}}_{X\\to Y} - \\Delta G^{\\mathrm{sol}}_{X\\to Y}$, so summing the three RBFE legs over a closed ligand cycle must also yield $0$ in the exact limit:\n$$\nS \\equiv \\sum_{\\text{cycle legs}} \\Delta\\Delta G_{X\\to Y} = 0.\n$$\nAny statistically significant nonzero $S$ therefore diagnoses systematic error. To evaluate significance, we propagate uncertainties by adding independent variances:\n$$\n\\sigma_S = \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 + \\sigma_3^2}.\n$$\n\nCompute the closures.\n\n- Cycle 1:\n  - Sum $S_1 = (+0.4) + (-7.8) + (+8.9) = +1.5\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n  - Uncertainty $\\sigma_{S_1} = \\sqrt{(0.1)^2 + (0.1)^2 + (0.1)^2} = \\sqrt{3}\\times 0.1 \\approx 0.173\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n  - Significance: $|S_1|/\\sigma_{S_1} \\approx 1.5/0.173 \\approx 8.67$, which is highly significant. Thus, Cycle 1 fails closure with a positive bias of about $+1.5\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\n- Cycle 2:\n  - Sum $S_2 = (-0.8) + (+0.9) + (-0.1) = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n  - Uncertainty $\\sigma_{S_2} = \\sqrt{(0.1)^2 + (0.1)^2 + (0.1)^2} \\approx 0.173\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n  - Significance: $|S_2|/\\sigma_{S_2} = 0/0.173 = 0$, fully consistent with zero. Thus, Cycle 2 closes within uncertainty.\n\nInterpretation from first principles and known, well-tested behaviors of molecular simulation algorithms:\n\n- The sole difference in composition between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 is the presence of charge-changing alchemical legs in Cycle 1 ($N_2\\to C_1$ and $C_1\\to N_1$), whereas Cycle 2 contains only neutral-to-neutral legs. The electrostatic treatment uses PME with a uniform neutralizing background. For transformations that change the net charge of the alchemical region, periodic boundary conditions with a neutralizing plasma introduce a finite-size self-interaction artifact whose magnitude scales inversely with the linear box dimension and depends on the net charge. When RBFE is constructed as a difference of complex and solvent legs that use different box sizes, $L_{\\mathrm{cx}} \\neq L_{\\mathrm{sol}}$, the spurious finite-size contributions do not fully cancel between legs. This yields an approximately constant offset for any leg that changes net charge, independent of the direction of the charge change (since the leading correction scales with the square of the net charge), producing a positive bias when summed over both charge-changing directions within a cycle. In contrast, neutral-to-neutral mutations are not affected by this specific finite-size artifact.\n\n- Long-range dispersion treatment is already corrected analytically in the protocol, and dispersion truncation errors would also affect neutral-to-neutral legs, which is inconsistent with Cycle 2’s exact closure.\n\n- Missing standard-state restraint corrections would add a constant offset to absolute binding free energies, but in RBFE constructed from mutations with identical restraints, those terms cancel leg-by-leg; moreover, such an omission would shift all legs similarly and thus would generate comparable closure deviations in both cycles, which is not observed.\n\n- Random sampling error would produce fluctuations of both signs and would not reproducibly correlate with the presence of charge-changing legs. The large $8.7\\sigma$ deviation in Cycle 1 alongside the exact closure of Cycle 2 contradicts a purely statistical explanation.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: It states that Cycle 1 shows a statistically significant positive closure deviation and Cycle 2 closes within uncertainty, matching the computed $S_1 = +1.5 \\pm 0.17\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$ and $S_2 = 0.0 \\pm 0.17\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$. It attributes the pattern to missing finite-size net-charge corrections under PME with differing $L_{\\mathrm{cx}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{sol}}$, which selectively biases charge-changing legs and thereby creates a positive cycle sum when two such legs are present. This mechanistic explanation is consistent with fundamental aspects of PME finite-size behavior and with the observed data. The suggested remedies (apply the analytical correction and/or match box sizes) are appropriate. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: It claims both cycles are statistically insignificant deviations. This contradicts $|S_1|/\\sigma_{S_1} \\approx 8.67$, which is highly significant. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It asserts that both cycles would show the same positive closure offset if restraint standard-state corrections were missing, and identifies this as the dominant source. The data show Cycle 2 closes within uncertainty, not with a positive offset, and RBFE with identical restraints largely cancels such terms. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It attributes the bias to missing long-range dispersion corrections and suggests enabling an analytical correction. However, the protocol already includes the analytical long-range dispersion correction, and dispersion-related biases would not selectively affect only cycles with charge-changing legs. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the cycle-closure analysis indicates a systematic, charge-dependent finite-size artifact due to differing box sizes between complex and solvent legs under PME, consistent with Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2642325"}]}
