I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n1) Derivation of the Equation of Motion\n\nThe Zwanzig-Mori formalism in the overdamped limit provides a first-order integro-differential equation for the normalized density autocorrelation function $\\phi(t)$. This equation takes the general form:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt} + \\Omega \\phi(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathcal{K}(t-t') \\phi(t') dt' = 0\n$$\nwith the initial condition $\\phi(0) = 1$. Here, $\\Omega$ is a bare relaxation rate. The memory kernel $\\mathcal{K}(t)$ represents retarded friction effects. An alternative, and for this problem more convenient, form involves the memory kernel acting on the derivative of the correlator:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt} + \\Omega \\phi(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} M(t-t') \\frac{d\\phi(t')}{dt'} dt' = 0\n$$\nThis form arises naturally in MCT and represents the feedback of density fluctuations on their own dynamics.\n\nThe schematic MCT approximation posits that the memory kernel $M(t)$ is a simple polynomial functional of the correlator $\\phi(t)$ itself. The problem specifies a second-degree polynomial with dimensionless coefficients $v_1$ and $v_2$. To maintain dimensional consistency (as $M(t)$ must be dimensionless), we write:\n$$\nM(t) = v_1 \\phi(t) + v_2 \\phi(t)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation of motion gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt} + \\Omega \\phi(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\left[ v_1 \\phi(t-t') + v_2 \\phi(t-t')^2 \\right] \\frac{d\\phi(t')}{dt'} dt' = 0\n$$\nTo eliminate the explicit dependence on $\\Omega$ as requested, we introduce a rescaled, dimensionless time $\\tau = \\Omega t$. Let $\\hat{\\phi}(\\tau) = \\phi(t) = \\phi(\\tau/\\Omega)$. The derivative becomes $\\frac{d}{dt} = \\Omega \\frac{d}{d\\tau}$. The equation transforms as follows:\n$$\n\\Omega \\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}(\\tau)}{d\\tau} + \\Omega \\hat{\\phi}(\\tau) + \\int_{0}^{\\tau/\\Omega} \\left[ v_1 \\phi(t-t') + v_2 \\phi(t-t')^2 \\right] \\left( \\Omega \\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}(\\tau')}{d\\tau'} \\right) dt' = 0\n$$\nWe change the integration variable to $\\tau' = \\Omega t'$, so $dt' = d\\tau'/\\Omega$. The upper limit of integration becomes $\\tau$. The arguments of $\\phi$ become $\\phi(t-t') = \\phi((\\tau-\\tau')/\\Omega) = \\hat{\\phi}(\\tau-\\tau')$.\n$$\n\\Omega \\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}(\\tau)}{d\\tau} + \\Omega \\hat{\\phi}(\\tau) + \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\left[ v_1 \\hat{\\phi}(\\tau-\\tau') + v_2 \\hat{\\phi}(\\tau-\\tau')^2 \\right] \\left( \\Omega \\frac{d\\hat{\\phi}(\\tau')}{d\\tau'} \\right) \\frac{d\\tau'}{\\Omega} = 0\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by $\\Omega$ and dropping the hats for notational simplicity (understanding that $t$ is now dimensionless time), we arrive at the final closed scalar equation of motion:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt} + \\phi(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\left[ v_1 \\phi(t-t') + v_2 \\phi(t-t')^2 \\right] \\frac{d\\phi(t')}{dt'} dt' = 0\n$$\nThis integro-differential equation, with the initial condition $\\phi(0) = 1$, governs the dynamics of the correlator in this schematic model.\n\n2) Algebraic Equation for the Nonergodicity Parameter $f$\n\nThe nonergodicity parameter is defined as the long-time limit of the correlator, $f \\equiv \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\phi(t)$. We can find an equation for $f$ by analyzing the equation of motion in the frequency domain using Laplace transforms. Let $\\tilde{\\phi}(s) = \\mathcal{L}[\\phi(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}\\phi(t)dt$. The memory kernel in the time domain is $m(t) = v_1 \\phi(t) + v_2 \\phi(t)^2$. Let $\\tilde{m}(s) = \\mathcal{L}[m(t)]$. The term involving the convolution becomes a product in Laplace space, $\\mathcal{L}[m(t) * \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}] = \\tilde{m}(s) \\mathcal{L}[\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}]$.\n\nThe Laplace transform of $\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$ is $s\\tilde{\\phi}(s) - \\phi(0) = s\\tilde{\\phi}(s) - 1$.\nTransforming the entire equation of motion:\n$$\n[s\\tilde{\\phi}(s) - 1] + \\tilde{\\phi}(s) + \\tilde{m}(s)[s\\tilde{\\phi}(s) - 1] = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\tilde{\\phi}(s)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\phi}(s)(s + 1 + s\\tilde{m}(s)) = 1 + \\tilde{m}(s) \\implies \\tilde{\\phi}(s) = \\frac{1 + \\tilde{m}(s)}{s + 1 + s\\tilde{m}(s)}\n$$\nWe use the final-value theorem: $f = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\phi(t) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s\\tilde{\\phi}(s)$.\nIf $\\phi(t) \\to f$ as $t\\to\\infty$, then $m(t) \\to v_1 f + v_2 f^2$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Let this limit be $m_f$. The Laplace transform of a function that tends to a constant $C$ has a simple pole at $s=0$ with residue $C$. Thus, for small $s$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\phi}(s) \\approx \\frac{f}{s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tilde{m}(s) \\approx \\frac{m_f}{s} = \\frac{v_1 f + v_2 f^2}{s}\n$$\nWe apply the final-value theorem:\n$$\nf = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\tilde{\\phi}(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\frac{1 + \\tilde{m}(s)}{s + 1 + s\\tilde{m}(s)}\n$$\nSubstituting the small-$s$ behavior of $\\tilde{m}(s)$:\n$$\nf = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\frac{1 + \\frac{m_f}{s}}{s + 1 + s\\frac{m_f}{s}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\frac{\\frac{s+m_f}{s}}{s+1+m_f} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{s(s+m_f)}{s(s+1+m_f)} = \\frac{m_f}{1+m_f}\n$$\nSubstituting back the expression for $m_f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{v_1 f + v_2 f^2}{1 + v_1 f + v_2 f^2}\n$$\nThis is the self-consistency equation for $f$. One solution is $f=0$, which corresponds to the ergodic liquid state. For a nonzero solution $f>0$ (the nonergodic glassy state), we can divide by $f$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{v_1 + v_2 f}{1 + v_1 f + v_2 f^2}\n$$\nRearranging gives the algebraic equation for $f$:\n$$\n1 + v_1 f + v_2 f^2 = v_1 + v_2 f \\implies v_2 f^2 + (v_1 - v_2)f + (1 - v_1) = 0\n$$\n\n3) Locus of the $A_2$ Bifurcation\n\nThe problem asks for the locus where a nonzero solution $f>0$ first appears. In the language of MCT, this is the ideal glass transition point, which corresponds to a fold or $A_2$ bifurcation. This bifurcation occurs when the quadratic equation for $f$ has a degenerate (double) root. The condition for this is that the discriminant $\\Delta$ of the quadratic equation must be zero.\n$$\n\\Delta = (v_1 - v_2)^2 - 4v_2(1-v_1) = 0\n$$\nExpanding and rearranging this expression:\n$$\nv_1^2 - 2v_1v_2 + v_2^2 - 4v_2 + 4v_1v_2 = 0\n$$\n$$\nv_1^2 + 2v_1v_2 + v_2^2 - 4v_2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(v_1 + v_2)^2 = 4v_2\n$$\nSolving for $v_1$ yields the locus in the $(v_1, v_2)$ plane:\n$$\nv_1 + v_2 = \\pm\\sqrt{4v_2} \\implies v_1^c = -v_2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{v_2}\n$$\nFor this to yield a real value for $v_1^c$, we must have $v_2 \\ge 0$.\nAt the bifurcation point, the double root solution for $f$ is given by $f_c = \\frac{-(v_1-v_2)}{2v_2} = \\frac{v_2-v_1}{2v_2}$.\nWe must check which branch of the solution for $v_1^c$ is physically meaningful. The nonergodicity parameter $f$ must satisfy $0 \\le f \\le 1$, as $\\phi(t)$ is a normalized correlation function bounded by its value at $t=0$, which is $1$.\n\nCase I: $v_1^c = -v_2 - 2\\sqrt{v_2}$\nThe solution at the bifurcation is:\n$$\nf_c = \\frac{v_2 - (-v_2 - 2\\sqrt{v_2})}{2v_2} = \\frac{2v_2 + 2\\sqrt{v_2}}{2v_2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{v_2}}\n$$\nFor any $v_2 > 0$, this gives $f_c > 1$, which is unphysical. This branch must be discarded.\n\nCase II: $v_1^c = -v_2 + 2\\sqrt{v_2}$\nThe solution at the bifurcation is:\n$$\nf_c = \\frac{v_2 - (-v_2 + 2\\sqrt{v_2})}{2v_2} = \\frac{2v_2 - 2\\sqrt{v_2}}{2v_2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{v_2}}\n$$\nFor this solution to be physical, we require $0 \\le f_c \\le 1$. The condition $f_c \\le 1$ is satisfied for all $v_2>0$. The condition $f_c \\ge 0$ requires $1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{v_2}} \\ge 0$, which implies $\\sqrt{v_2} \\ge 1$, or $v_2 \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, the physical locus for the $A_2$ bifurcation, where a non-zero glass state appears, is given by the expression from Case II, with the domain restriction $v_2 \\ge 1$. The specific wording of the question asks for a single analytic expression, which is determined by this physical reasoning.\n\nThe final expression for the critical line $v_1^c(v_2)$ is:\n$$\nv_1^c = -v_2 + 2\\sqrt{v_2}\n$$\nThis defines the boundary in the parameter space where the liquid state ($f=0$) becomes unstable to the formation of a glassy state ($f>0$) via a fold bifurcation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-v_2 + 2\\sqrt{v_2}}$$", "id": "2682090"}, {"introduction": "While idealized theories often focus on equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium states, real glasses are typically formed by cooling faster than they can relax, trapping them in non-equilibrium aging states.

Do not round; no numerical values are required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio, $X(C)$, from a given parametric relationship between the integrated linear response, $R$, and the two-time autocorrelation function, $C$. The analysis proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the general relation for the fluctuation-dissipation ratio $X(C)$.\n\nWe begin from the principles of linear response theory. The deviation of the average of an observable, $A(t)$, from its equilibrium value in the presence of a time-dependent external field, $h(t')$, is given by:\n$$ \\langle A(t) \\rangle_h - \\langle A(t) \\rangle_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\chi(t, t') h(t') \\, dt' $$\nwhere $\\chi(t, t')$ is the impulse response function, and causality requires $\\chi(t, t') = 0$ for $t' > t$. The problem specifies a step-function field applied at the waiting time $t_w$, given by $h(t') = h_0 \\Theta(t' - t_w)$, where $\\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function and $h_0$ is the field amplitude. Substituting this field into the linear response formula for an observation time $t > t_w$ yields:\n$$ \\langle A(t) \\rangle_{h_0} - \\langle A(t) \\rangle_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\chi(t, t') h_0 \\Theta(t' - t_w) \\, dt' = h_0 \\int_{t_w}^{t} \\chi(t, t') \\, dt' $$\nThe problem defines the zero-field-cooled integrated linear response, $R(t, t_w)$, as:\n$$ R(t, t_w) \\equiv \\lim_{h_0 \\to 0} \\frac{\\langle A(t) \\rangle_{h_0} - \\langle A(t) \\rangle_0}{h_0} = \\int_{t_w}^{t} \\chi(t, t') \\, dt' $$\nThis directly relates the integrated response $R(t,t_w)$ to the impulse response $\\chi(t,t')$. To find $\\chi(t,t_w)$, we differentiate $R(t, t_w)$ with respect to its lower integration limit, $t_w$, using the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R(t, t_w)}{\\partial t_w} = -\\chi(t, t_w) $$\nThis provides a direct connection between the impulse response and the derivative of the integrated response.\n\nNext, we establish the generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation. In thermal equilibrium, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) relates the impulse response $\\chi_{eq}(t,t')$ to the time-derivative of the correlation function $\\tilde{C}_{eq}(t,t') = \\langle \\delta A(t) \\delta A(t') \\rangle$:\n$$ \\chi_{eq}(t, t') = -\\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{C}_{eq}(t, t')}{\\partial t'} $$\nFor an out-of-equilibrium aging system, this relation is generalized by introducing the fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR), $X(t, t')$, which quantifies the deviation from the equilibrium FDT:\n$$ \\chi(t, t') = -\\frac{X(t, t')}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{C}(t, t')}{\\partial t'} $$\nwhere $\\tilde{C}(t,t')=\\langle \\delta A(t) \\delta A(t') \\rangle$. The problem, however, uses the normalized correlation function $C(t, t_w) \\equiv \\langle \\delta A(t) \\delta A(t_w) \\rangle / \\langle \\delta A(t_w)^2 \\rangle$. The analysis is substantially simplified by considering the parametric plot of $R$ versus $C$. The slope of this curve, generated by varying $t_w$ at a fixed observation time $t$, is given by the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dC} = \\frac{\\partial R(t, t_w) / \\partial t_w}{\\partial C(t, t_w) / \\partial t_w} $$\nBy substituting $\\partial R(t, t_w) / \\partial t_w = -\\chi(t, t_w)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dC} = \\frac{-\\chi(t, t_w)}{\\partial C(t, t_w) / \\partial t_w} $$\nA common and consistent definition of the FDR in aging systems, which respects the problem's framing, relates the impulse response to the derivative of the normalized correlation function:\n$$ \\chi(t, t_w) = \\frac{X(t, t_w)}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial C(t, t_w)}{\\partial t_w} $$\nThis form is chosen such that for equilibrium dynamics, where $C(t, t_w) = C_{eq}(t-t_w)$, the response is positive for $t>t_w$ and $X=1$. Substituting this definition of $\\chi(t, t_w)$ into the equation for the slope $dR/dC$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dC} = \\frac{-\\frac{X(t, t_w)}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial C(t, t_w)}{\\partial t_w}}{\\partial C(t, t_w) / \\partial t_w} = -\\frac{X(t, t_w)}{k_B T} $$\nThe problem states that in the limit of large times $t$ and $t_w$, the FDR becomes a function of $C$ alone, $X(t, t_w) \\to X(C)$. Therefore, we arrive at the general relation:\n$$ X(C) = -k_B T \\frac{dR}{dC} $$\nThis completes the first task. This equation expresses the fluctuation-dissipation ratio $X(C)$ in terms of the slope of the parametric curve of the integrated response $R$ versus the correlation $C$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the explicit form of $X(C)$.\n\nWe now apply the derived relation to the specific piecewise-linear function $R(C)$ provided in the problem statement.\n\nFor the first regime, $q \\le C \\le 1$:\nThe response function is given by $R(C) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} (1-C)$.\nWe calculate the derivative of $R$ with respect to $C$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left[ \\frac{1}{k_B T} (1-C) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{k_B T} $$\nSubstituting this slope into our expression for $X(C)$:\n$$ X(C) = -k_B T \\left( -\\frac{1}{k_B T} \\right) = 1 $$\nThis regime corresponds to fast, quasi-equilibrium dynamics where the fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds, and thus $X(C)=1$.\n\nFor the second regime, $0 \\le C < q$:\nThe response function is given by $R(C) = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\left[ (1-q) + x(q-C) \\right]$.\nWe calculate the derivative of $R$ with respect to $C$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left[ \\frac{1}{k_B T} (1-q + xq - xC) \\right] = -\\frac{x}{k_B T} $$\nSubstituting this slope into our expression for $X(C)$:\n$$ X(C) = -k_B T \\left( -\\frac{x}{k_B T} \\right) = x $$\nThis regime corresponds to the slow, non-equilibrium structural relaxation (aging), characterized by a violation of the FDT with a constant ratio $x$, where $0 < x < 1$.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the explicit analytical form of $X(C)$ as a single piecewise function. The function $R(C)$ is continuous at $C=q$, but its derivative is not. The value of $X(C)$ is therefore different in the two regimes, with a discontinuity at $C=q$. The result is:\n$$ X(C) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{for } q \\le C \\le 1 \\\\ x & \\text{for } 0 \\le C < q \\end{cases} $$\nThis piecewise function is the final analytical expression for the fluctuation-dissipation ratio.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{X(C) = \\begin{cases} 1 & q \\le C \\le 1 \\\\ x & 0 \\le C < q \\end{cases}} $$", "id": "2682137"}, {"introduction": "As an alternative to the purely dynamical framework of MCT, the Random First-Order Transition (RFOT) theory provides a thermodynamically grounded picture of the glass transition.

The free-energy expression provided is the canonical form used in this theory to describe the competition between surface energy penalty and bulk entropy gain for a rearranging region. All parameters are standard within this context. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness and Consistency**: The problem requires finding the stationary point of a given function, a standard and well-defined mathematical task. The parameters provided are sufficient and consistent. For instance, the temperature $T_g$ appears in the expression for $\\Upsilon$ and the entropy term, but it cancels out during the derivation of $\\xi^*$, so its numerical value is not needed. This demonstrates internal consistency. There is a minor imprecision in the problem statement: it instructs to \"derive $\\xi^{*}$ by minimizing $\\Delta F(\\xi)$\". A formal analysis shows that for $d > \\theta$ (here, $3 > 2$), the stationary point of $\\Delta F(\\xi)$ is a maximum, corresponding to the peak of the free energy barrier for rearrangement. However, the instruction \"the mosaic correlation length $\\xi^{*}$ is determined by the condition that $\\Delta F(\\xi)$ is stationary\" is correct and unambiguous. The procedure to find a stationary point (setting the first derivative to zero) is the same for a maximum or a minimum. This linguistic flaw does not render the problem invalid, as the core mathematical task is clearly defined.\n\n3.  **Objectivity and Realism**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms. The given numerical values for particle size, configurational entropy, and the dynamic correlation length are physically plausible for typical organic glass-forming liquids near their glass transition.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The minor imprecision regarding \"minimizing\" is noted but does not impede a rigorous and unambiguous solution based on the primary instruction to find the stationary point. The solution will now proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe free-energy cost for rearranging a compact region of linear size $\\xi$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta F(\\xi) = \\Upsilon \\xi^{\\theta} - T k_B s_c(T) \\rho \\xi^{d} $$\nWe are interested in the situation at the glass transition temperature, $T = T_g$. The mosaic correlation length, $\\xi^{*}$, is the length scale at which this free energy is stationary. This condition is expressed by setting the first derivative of $\\Delta F(\\xi)$ with respect to $\\xi$ equal to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta F)}{d\\xi} \\bigg|_{\\xi=\\xi^{*}} = 0 $$\nCalculating the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\left( \\Upsilon \\xi^{\\theta} - T_g k_B s_c(T_g) \\rho \\xi^{d} \\right) = \\theta \\Upsilon \\xi^{\\theta-1} - d T_g k_B s_c(T_g) \\rho \\xi^{d-1} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero at $\\xi = \\xi^{*}$ (and for a non-trivial solution where $\\xi^{*} \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\theta \\Upsilon (\\xi^{*})^{\\theta-1} = d T_g k_B s_c(T_g) \\rho (\\xi^{*})^{d-1} $$\nWe can solve for $\\xi^{*}$:\n$$ (\\xi^{*})^{d-\\theta} = \\frac{\\theta \\Upsilon}{d T_g k_B s_c(T_g) \\rho} $$\n$$ \\xi^{*} = \\left( \\frac{\\theta \\Upsilon}{d T_g k_B s_c(T_g) \\rho} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{d-\\theta}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given relations for $\\Upsilon$ and $\\rho$.\nGiven: $d=3$, $\\theta=2$, $\\rho = 1/a^3$, and $\\Upsilon = u_0 k_B T_g / a^{\\theta} = u_0 k_B T_g / a^2$.\nThe exponent becomes $1/(d-\\theta) = 1/(3-2) = 1$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\xi^{*}$:\n$$ \\xi^{*} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\left(\\frac{u_0 k_B T_g}{a^2}\\right)}{3 T_g k_B s_c(T_g) \\left(\\frac{1}{a^3}\\right)} \\right)^{1} $$\nThe terms $T_g$ and $k_B$ cancel, which is expected as the length scale should be determined by material properties, not temperature alone in this scaled form.\n$$ \\xi^{*} = \\frac{2 u_0 / a^2}{3 s_c(T_g) / a^3} = \\frac{2 u_0}{a^2} \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{3 s_c(T_g)} $$\nThis simplifies to a concise expression for the mosaic correlation length:\n$$ \\xi^{*} = \\frac{2 u_0 a}{3 s_c(T_g)} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values to evaluate $\\xi^{*}$:\n- $u_0 = 6.0$\n- $a = 0.50$ nm\n- $s_c(T_g) = 0.80$\n$$ \\xi^{*} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.0 \\times (0.50 \\text{ nm})}{3 \\times 0.80} = \\frac{6.0 \\text{ nm}}{2.4} = 2.5 \\text{ nm} $$\nThe mosaic correlation length at the glass transition is $\\xi^{*} = 2.5$ nm.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $r = \\xi^{*}/\\xi_4(T_g)$. The dynamic correlation length is given as $\\xi_4(T_g) = 2.20$ nm.\n$$ r = \\frac{\\xi^{*}}{\\xi_4(T_g)} = \\frac{2.5 \\text{ nm}}{2.20 \\text{ nm}} $$\n$$ r = \\frac{2.5}{2.20} = \\frac{25}{22} \\approx 1.13636... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ r \\approx 1.14 $$\nThis result indicates that, for the given parameters, the static mosaic length scale predicted by RFOT theory is slightly larger than the dynamic correlation length measured by the four-point susceptibility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.14}$$", "id": "2682106"}]}
