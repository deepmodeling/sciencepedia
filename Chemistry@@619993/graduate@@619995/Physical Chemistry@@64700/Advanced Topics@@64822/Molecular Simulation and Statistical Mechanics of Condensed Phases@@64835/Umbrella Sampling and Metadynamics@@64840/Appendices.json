It presents a standard theoretical problem in statistical mechanics concerning the calculation of a potential of mean force for a system with a quadratic potential energy function. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and the tasks are logically structured. The problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe solution is organized into three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1. Definition of the constrained ensemble average.\n\nThe canonical ensemble average of an observable $A(q)$, where $q$ represents the set of all coordinates, is given by\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\int A(q) \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\, dq}{\\int \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\, dq},\n$$\nwhere $U(q)$ is the potential energy, $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$ is the inverse temperature, and the integral is over the entire configuration space.\n\nTo define a constrained ensemble average $\\langle A \\rangle_{s}$ at a fixed value $s$ of a collective variable $s(q)$, we must restrict the configuration space to the hypersurface defined by the holonomic constraint $s(q)=s$. This is achieved formally by introducing the Dirac delta function, $\\delta(s(q)-s)$. The probability density of finding the system at a particular configuration $q$ in the constrained ensemble is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\delta(s(q)-s)$.\n\nThus, the constrained ensemble average of an observable $A(q)$ is defined as the ratio of integrals:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\int A(q) \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\delta(s(q)-s) \\, dq}{\\int \\exp(-\\beta U(q)) \\delta(s(q)-s) \\, dq}.\n$$\nIn the present case, the configuration is specified by the Cartesian coordinates $q=(x,y)$, so $dq=dx\\,dy$. The collective variable is $s(x,y)=x$. The constraint is therefore $x=s$, and the delta function is $\\delta(x-s)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general definition, we obtain:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A(x,y) \\exp[-\\beta U(x,y)] \\delta(x-s) \\, dx \\, dy}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp[-\\beta U(x,y)] \\delta(x-s) \\, dx \\, dy}.\n$$\nWe can now use the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, $\\int f(x) \\delta(x-s) \\, dx = f(s)$, to perform the integration over $x$. This yields:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A(s,y) \\exp[-\\beta U(s,y)] \\, dy}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp[-\\beta U(s,y)] \\, dy}.\n$$\nThis is the simplified definition for the constrained average in this Cartesian case. The surface measure element $d\\Sigma$ on the hypersurface $x=s$ is simply $dy$. A general surface element includes a Jacobian factor, $d\\Sigma = |\\nabla s|^{-1} dq_s$, where $dq_s$ is the volume element of the surface. Here, $s(x,y)=x$, so $\\nabla s = (1,0)$ and $|\\nabla s| = 1$. The Jacobian factor is unity, which is consistent with our direct simplification.\n\n2. Computation of the constrained average generalized force.\n\nThe generalized force along the collective variable $s=x$ is $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial s}$, which is interpreted as $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}$ evaluated on the hypersurface $x=s$. First, we compute the partial derivative of the potential energy $U(x,y) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{x}\\,x^{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{y}\\,(y - \\alpha\\,x)^{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{x}\\,x^{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{y}\\,(y - \\alpha\\,x)^{2} \\right] = k_{x}\\,x + k_{y}(y-\\alpha x)(-\\alpha) = k_{x}\\,x - \\alpha k_{y}(y - \\alpha x).\n$$\nWe need to compute the constrained average $\\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s} \\bigr\\rangle_{s}$. The observable to be averaged is the expression for $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}$ with $x$ replaced by $s$:\n$$\nA(s,y) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=s} = k_{x}s - \\alpha k_{y}(y - \\alpha s).\n$$\nUsing the definition from part 1, the average is:\n$$\n\\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s} \\bigr\\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [k_{x}s - \\alpha k_{y}(y - \\alpha s)] \\exp[-\\beta U(s,y)] \\, dy}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp[-\\beta U(s,y)] \\, dy},\n$$\nwhere $U(s,y) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{x}\\,s^{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{y}\\,(y - \\alpha s)^{2}$.\nThe term $\\exp[-\\beta (\\tfrac{1}{2} k_x s^2)]$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $y$ and will cancel from the numerator and denominator. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s} \\bigr\\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [k_{x}s - \\alpha k_{y}(y - \\alpha s)] \\exp[-\\beta \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{y}(y-\\alpha s)^2] \\, dy}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp[-\\beta \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{y}(y-\\alpha s)^2] \\, dy}.\n$$\nWe can separate this into two terms:\n$$\n\\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s} \\bigr\\rangle_{s} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} k_{x}s \\exp[\\dots] \\, dy}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp[\\dots] \\, dy} - \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha k_{y}(y - \\alpha s) \\exp[\\dots] \\, dy}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp[\\dots] \\, dy}.\n$$\nFor the first term, $k_x s$ is a constant, so it factors out of the integral, which then cancels with the denominator, leaving $k_x s$.\nFor the second term, we consider the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (y - \\alpha s) \\exp[-\\beta \\tfrac{1}{2} k_{y}(y-\\alpha s)^2] \\, dy$. Let $z = y - \\alpha s$, so $dy = dz$. The integral becomes $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z \\exp(-\\frac{\\beta k_y}{2} z^2) \\, dz$. The integrand $f(z) = z \\exp(-C z^2)$ (with $C = \\frac{\\beta k_y}{2} > 0$) is an odd function of $z$. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is zero. Therefore, the second term vanishes.\nCombining the results, the constrained average force is:\n$$\n\\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s} \\bigr\\rangle_{s} = k_{x}s.\n$$\n\n3. Thermodynamic integration to obtain the potential of mean force $F(s)$.\n\nThe potential of mean force $F(s)$ is obtained by integrating the mean force along the collective variable, starting from a reference point. The thermodynamic integration identity is given as:\n$$\nF(b) - F(a) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s'} \\bigr\\rangle_{s'} \\, ds'.\n$$\nWe set $a=0$ and $b=s$, and use the result from part 2, $\\bigl\\langle \\tfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial s'} \\bigr\\rangle_{s'} = k_{x}s'$.\n$$\nF(s) - F(0) = \\int_{0}^{s} k_{x}s' \\, ds'.\n$$\nPerforming this elementary integration:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{s} k_{x}s' \\, ds' = k_{x} \\left[ \\frac{(s')^{2}}{2} \\right]_{0}^{s} = k_{x} \\left( \\frac{s^{2}}{2} - \\frac{0^{2}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{x}s^{2}.\n$$\nSo, we have $F(s) - F(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{x}s^{2}$. The problem specifies the reference value $F(0)=0$, which uniquely determines the potential of mean force.\nSubstituting $F(0)=0$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{x}s^{2}.\n$$\nThis result is independent of the parameters $\\alpha$ and $k_y$. This is because the contribution to the free energy from integrating over the $y$ degree of freedom, for any fixed $x=s$, is a constant independent of $s$. This constant is absorbed into the reference value of the potential of mean force. The $s$-dependence of the PMF arises solely from the part of the potential energy that cannot be averaged out by integrating over the other degrees of freedom. In this case, that is the term $\\frac{1}{2}k_x x^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} k_{x} s^{2}}$$", "id": "2685152"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, metadynamics reconstructs the free energy profile by depositing infinitely narrow potential hills.

After obtaining a continuous estimate $\\widehat{F}'(s)$ of the derivative of the PMF on $[-\\pi,\\pi)$, enforce the periodic boundary by removing any net drift, for example by replacing $\\widehat{F}'(s)$ with $\\widehat{F}'(s) - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\widehat{F}'(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ so that $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\widehat{F}'(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = 0$, then integrate and choose the additive constant so that $F(-\\pi)=F(\\pi)$.\n\nC.

Unwrap the angle time series to a monotone coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}$ before estimating mean forces, integrate on $\\mathbb{R}$ to obtain $F(s)$ in an extended domain, and finally fold the result modulo $2\\pi$ back to $[-\\pi,\\pi)$; the folding guarantees periodicity regardless of sampling coverage or smoothing choices.\n\nE. When smoothing noisy force or free-energy estimates, use a periodic representation in $s$ (for example, a truncated Fourier series basis $\\sum_{n=-N}^{N} c_{n} e^{\\mathrm{i} n s}$ or a von Mises kernel on $S^{1}$) rather than nonperiodic polynomials or Gaussian kernels on $\\mathbb{R}$, to enforce continuity and $2\\pi$-periodicity by construction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the necessary and sufficient procedures for the consistent treatment of a periodic collective variable (CV), $s$, in an umbrella integration calculation to ensure the resulting potential of mean force (PMF), $F(s)$, is continuous and correctly periodic. The CV $s$ is defined on the circle $S^1$, which is a compact manifold, and is taken to be in the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi)$.\n\nThe fundamental properties of the PMF for such a system are derived from its definition, $F(s) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(s) + C$, where $P(s)$ is the probability density. Since the CV is $2\\pi$-periodic, the configuration space is topologically a circle. Thus, the probability density must be periodic, $P(s)=P(s+2\\pi)$. Consequently, the PMF must also be periodic, $F(s) = F(s+2\\pi)$, up to the arbitrary additive constant $C$. This implies that the derivative of the PMF, the mean force $F'(s) = \\mathrm{d}F/\\mathrm{d}s$, must also be a $2\\pi$-periodic function. A necessary condition for a function $G(s)$ to be the derivative of a periodic function is that its integral over one period must be zero. In our case, this means $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} F'(s) \\mathrm{d}s = F(\\pi) - F(-\\pi) = 0$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed procedure against these fundamental requirements.\n\nA. Define the harmonic umbrella bias in each window using the minimum-image angular displacement on the circle, for example $\\Delta s = \\mathrm{atan2}\\!\\left(\\sin(s - s_{0}), \\cos(s - s_{0})\\right)$, and use $U_{\\mathrm{bias}}(s) = \\tfrac{1}{2}k\\,\\Delta s^{2}$ so that the bias and its derivative are continuous across $s=\\pm\\pi$ and windows near $-\\pi$ and $+\\pi$ overlap on $S^{1}$.\n\nThis procedure addresses the setup of the biased simulations. The use of a distance metric appropriate for a circle, such as the minimum-image angular displacement, is absolutely necessary. If one were to use the simple difference $s-s_0$, a window centered at $s_i = -\\pi+\\delta$ and another at $s_j = \\pi-\\delta$ (for small $\\delta  0$) would be treated as being far apart, with a distance of nearly $2\\pi$. Topologically, on the circle $S^1$, they are adjacent, separated by a distance of $2\\delta$. The minimum-image convention correctly reflects the topology of the CV space, ensuring that windows near the arbitrary boundaries of the $[-\\pi, \\pi)$ interval properly overlap. This is essential for sampling the transition region across the boundary and obtaining a continuous probability distribution estimate.\n\nHowever, the statement contains a factual error. The potential form $U_{\\mathrm{bias}}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}k(\\Delta s)^2$, where $\\Delta s = \\mathrm{atan2}(\\sin(s-s_0), \\cos(s-s_0))$, does not have a continuous derivative. The displacement $\\Delta s$ is discontinuous at $s = s_0 + (2n+1)\\pi$, where it jumps between $\\pi$ and $-\\pi$. The potential $U_{\\mathrm{bias}}$ is continuous because $(\\pm\\pi)^2 = \\pi^2$. The biasing force, $F_{\\mathrm{bias}} = -\\mathrm{d}U_{\\mathrm{bias}}/\\mathrm{d}s = -k \\Delta s (\\mathrm{d}(\\Delta s)/\\mathrm{d}s) = -k \\Delta s$, is discontinuous at this point. A better choice for a harmonic-like, smooth, periodic potential is a cosine function, $U_{\\mathrm{bias}}(s) = k'(1-\\cos(s-s_0))$, which is harmonic for small $|s-s_0|$.\n\nDespite this imprecision in the example, the core principle—defining the bias potential using a distance on the circle—is correct and necessary. Without this, the entire sampling scheme is fundamentally flawed. We shall interpret the option as endorsing this core principle.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. After obtaining a continuous estimate $\\widehat{F}'(s)$ of the derivative of the PMF on $[-\\pi,\\pi)$, enforce the periodic boundary by removing any net drift, for example by replacing $\\widehat{F}'(s)$ with $\\widehat{F}'(s) - \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\widehat{F}'(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ so that $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\widehat{F}'(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = 0$, then integrate and choose the additive constant so that $F(-\\pi)=F(\\pi)$.\n\nThis procedure addresses the integration of the estimated mean force, $\\widehat{F}'(s)$. As established, for the PMF $F(s)$ to be a valid, single-valued function on the circle, its change over a full cycle must be zero, which means $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} F'(s)\\mathrm{d}s = 0$. Due to finite sampling and other numerical errors, any estimated mean force $\\widehat{F}'(s)$ will likely not satisfy this condition, i.e., $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\widehat{F}'(s)\\mathrm{d}s = \\mathcal{E} \\neq 0$. Integrating this flawed force profile yields a PMF with a discontinuity at the boundary: $\\widehat{F}(\\pi) - \\widehat{F}(-\\pi) = \\mathcal{E}$. The proposed correction defines a new force profile, $F'_{\\text{corr}}(s) = \\widehat{F}'(s) - \\bar{F}'$, where $\\bar{F}' = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}\\widehat{F}'(u)\\mathrm{d}u$ is the average force, or \"drift\". The integral of the corrected force is $\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} F'_{\\text{corr}}(s)\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\widehat{F}'(s)\\mathrm{d}s - \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\bar{F}'\\mathrm{d}s = \\mathcal{E} - (2\\pi)\\bar{F}' = \\mathcal{E} - (2\\pi)\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{2\\pi} = 0$. This procedure correctly and necessarily enforces the physical constraint for a state function on a closed path. This is a standard and critical step in any umbrella integration scheme for periodic variables.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Construct histograms and force estimates in $[-\\pi,\\pi)$ without wrapping counts or forces across the endpoints and discard samples that cross $s=\\pi$ during a time step to avoid double counting; the loss of data is compensated by the other windows.\n\nThis procedure is fundamentally incorrect and would lead to severe artifacts. Treating the domain $[-\\pi, \\pi)$ as a disconnected line segment by \"not wrapping counts\" ignores the periodic nature of the CV. It fails to combine information from simulations sampling near $-\\pi$ and near $+\\pi$, which are physically adjacent regions. This alone will create a large discontinuity in the reconstructed PMF. Furthermore, \"discard[ing] samples that cross $s=\\pi$\" introduces a profound bias. This is equivalent to placing an artificial, infinitely high potential barrier at the arbitrary boundary. This systematically removes valid trajectories from the ensemble, destroying information about the transition kinetics and equilibrium distribution, and will result in a completely erroneous PMF with an artificial barrier at $s=\\pi$. This procedure is the antithesis of a correct treatment.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Unwrap the angle time series to a monotone coordinate on $\\mathbb{R}$ before estimating mean forces, integrate on $\\mathbb{R}$ to obtain $F(s)$ in an extended domain, and finally fold the result modulo $2\\pi$ back to $[-\\pi,\\pi)$; the folding guarantees periodicity regardless of sampling coverage or smoothing choices.\n\nUnwrapping the aperiodic time series a valid first step for data processing, as it can simplify some subsequent calculations by avoiding repeated minimum-image computations. However, the procedure as a whole is flawed because of the final claim. \"Folding\" the result (i.e., taking the segment of the PMF from the extended real line, $F_{\\text{ext}}(s)$, that lies in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$) does not \"guarantee\" periodicity. Periodicity requires that $F(-\\pi) = F(\\pi)$. If the extended PMF has a systematic drift, such that $F_{\\text{ext}}(s+2\\pi) \\neq F_{\\text{ext}}(s)$, then the folded segment will exhibit a discontinuity, $F_{\\text{ext}}(\\pi) \\neq F_{\\text{ext}}(-\\pi)$. Such drift is common due to statistical error. Periodicity must be actively enforced on the data (for example, using the method in option B or E on the unwrapped coordinate) before the final profile is considered valid. The folding step itself provides no such guarantee. The claim is false, making the procedure insufficient.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. When smoothing noisy force or free-energy estimates, use a periodic representation in $s$ (for example, a truncated Fourier series basis $\\sum_{n=-N}^{N} c_{n} e^{\\mathrm{i} n s}$ or a von Mises kernel on $S^{1}$) rather than nonperiodic polynomials or Gaussian kernels on $\\mathbb{R}$, to enforce continuity and $2\\pi$-periodicity by construction.\n\nRaw data from simulations is inherently noisy. A smoothing or fitting procedure is often employed to obtain a clean representation of the mean force or the PMF. If one applies a non-periodic smoothing function (e.g., a standard polynomial or a Gaussian kernel defined on $\\mathbb{R}$) to data on the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi)$, the smoothed function will generally not have matching values and derivatives at the endpoints, i.e., $f(-\\pi) \\neq f(\\pi)$ and $f'(-\\pi) \\neq f'(\\pi)$. This introduces an artificial seam at the arbitrary boundary which violates the physics of the system. In contrast, using a basis of functions that are inherently periodic, such as a Fourier series, or using periodic kernels like the von Mises distribution, guarantees that the resulting smoothed function is periodic with continuous derivatives to all orders (for the Fourier series) or a specified order. This enforces the correct topology of the problem directly within the data analysis stage. If smoothing is part of the workflow, this method is necessary to preserve physical consistency.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, a complete and robust protocol requires correct sampling that respects the periodic topology (A), enforcement of the zero-integral constraint on the mean force to ensure the PMF is a state function (B), and use of period-aware methods for any data smoothing to avoid introducing boundary artifacts (E). These three procedures, applied at the appropriate stages of simulation and analysis, are necessary for a consistent treatment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2685124"}]}
