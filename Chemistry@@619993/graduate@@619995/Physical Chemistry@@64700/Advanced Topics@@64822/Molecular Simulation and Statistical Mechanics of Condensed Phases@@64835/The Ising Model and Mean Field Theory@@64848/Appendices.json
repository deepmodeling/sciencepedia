Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to derive the zero-field magnetic susceptibility per spin, $\\chi(\\beta)$. This will be accomplished in three sequential steps as requested: first, the derivation of the partition function $Z_N$; second, the derivation of the magnetization per spin $m$; and third, the calculation of the susceptibility $\\chi$ by differentiation of $m$.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Partition Function $Z_N(\\beta,h)$**\n\nThe system consists of $N$ independent Ising spins, $s_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$. The Hamiltonian in an external field $h$ is given as $H = -h \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i$. The canonical partition function is defined as the sum over all possible microstates of the system:\n$$Z_N(\\beta,h) = \\sum_{\\{s_i\\}} \\exp(-\\beta H)$$\nwhere the sum is over all $2^N$ configurations of the spins $\\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_N\\}$.\n\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian into the definition of $Z_N$:\n$$Z_N(\\beta,h) = \\sum_{\\{s_1, \\dots, s_N\\}} \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left(-h \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i\\right)\\right) = \\sum_{\\{s_1, \\dots, s_N\\}} \\exp\\left(\\beta h \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i\\right)$$\nBecause the exponential of a sum is the product of exponentials, we can write:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\beta h \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\exp(\\beta h s_i)$$\nThe sum over all configurations $\\{s_1, \\dots, s_N\\}$ can be expressed as a series of independent sums for each spin variable $s_i$:\n$$Z_N(\\beta,h) = \\sum_{s_1=\\pm 1} \\sum_{s_2=\\pm 1} \\cdots \\sum_{s_N=\\pm 1} \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\exp(\\beta h s_i)$$\nSince the term for each spin $s_i$ in the product depends only on that spin, the sums and products can be interchanged:\n$$Z_N(\\beta,h) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\sum_{s_i=\\pm 1} \\exp(\\beta h s_i) \\right)$$\nEach term in the product is identical, corresponding to the partition function for a single spin, which we denote as $Z_1$.
