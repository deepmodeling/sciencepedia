Justification of the Pairwise Dispersion Interaction ($V_2$)**\n\nWe consider two neutral, isotropic, non-overlapping atoms, A and B, in their ground electronic states $|0_A\\rangle$ and $|0_B\\rangle$. The interaction between them is described by the dipole-dipole interaction operator, $\\hat{V}_{AB}$, which serves as the perturbation in Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory.

The numerator contains the square of the matrix element of $\\hat{V}_{AB}$, which has an explicit $R_{AB}^{-3}$ dependence. Therefore, the numerator is proportional to $(R_{AB}^{-3})^2 = R_{AB}^{-6}$. The denominator is the difference in energy between the ground state and an excited state, which is always negative. Consequently, $E^{(2)}$ is always negative, signifying an attractive interaction. This justifies the functional form of the pairwise London dispersion interaction:\n$$V_2(R_{AB}) = E^{(2)} = -\\frac{C_6}{R_{AB}^6}$$\nwhere $C_6$ is a positive constant, the dispersion coefficient, which consolidates all the atomic properties from the sum-over-states formula.\n\nFor the system of three argon atoms at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side $R$, there are three identical pairs: ($1,2$), ($2,3$), and ($1,3$). The total pairwise interaction energy is the sum over these three pairs:\n$$\\sum_{\\text{pairs}} V_2 = V_2(R_{12}) + V_2(R_{23}) + V_2(R_{31}) = 3 \\times \\left(-\\frac{C_6}{R^6}\\right) = -\\frac{3C_6}{R^6}$$\n\n**2. Justification of the Three-Body Dispersion Interaction ($V_3$)**\n\nThe leading nonadditive interaction arises from third-order perturbation theory. The total perturbation operator for the three-atom system is the sum of pairwise dipole-dipole interactions:\n$$\\hat{V} = \\hat{V}_{12} + \\hat{V}_{23} + \\hat{V}_{31}$$\nThe third-order energy correction is given by a complex expression involving sums over intermediate states. The specific term that gives rise to the three-body interaction is the one that couples all three atoms sequentially, for example where atom $1$ interacts with $2$, atom $2$ interacts with $3$, and atom $3$ interacts back with $1$. This corresponds to a cross-term in the perturbation expansion of the form $\\langle 0|\\hat{V}_{12}|i\\rangle\\langle i|\\hat{V}_{23}|j\\rangle\\langle j|\\hat{V}_{31}|0\\rangle$. Since each dipole-dipole operator $\\hat{V}_{ij}$ contributes a factor proportional to $R_{ij}^{-3}$, the third-order energy correction involving this three-way coupling will be proportional to the product $R_{12}^{-3} R_{23}^{-3} R_{31}^{-3}$.\n\nThis analysis leads to the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential, which is the leading three-body dispersion term:\n$$V_3(R_{12}, R_{23}, R_{31}) = C_9 \\frac{1 + 3\\cos\\theta_1\\cos\\theta_2\\cos\\theta_3}{R_{12}^3 R_{23}^3 R_{31}^3}$$\nHere, $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$ are the interior angles of the triangle formed by the three atoms, and $C_9$ is the triple-dipole coefficient, which is positive for like atoms.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle, we have $R_{12} = R_{23} = R_{31} = R$ and $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2 = \\theta_3 = 60^\\circ$.

The expression for $V_3$ for this specific geometry is:\n$$V_3 = \\frac{11 C_9}{8 R^9}$$\n\n**3.

The conversion factors are given as $1$ Hartree $= 2625.499638$ $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ and $1$ Bohr $= 0.529177210903$ $\\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n\nThe dispersion coefficients $C_{n}$ in units of $\\mathrm{kJ/mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{\\AA}^n$ are obtained from their values in atomic units, $C_{n}^{\\mathrm{(au)}}$ in $\\mathrm{Hartree} \\cdot \\mathrm{Bohr}^n$, as follows:\n$$\nC_{n} = C_{n}^{\\mathrm{(au)}} \\times \\left( \\frac{2625.499638 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{Hartree}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{0.529177210903 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{Bohr}} \\right)^{n}\n$$\nFor the given Argon dimer parameters, $C_{6}^{\\mathrm{(au)}} = 64.30$ and $C_{8}^{\\mathrm{(au)}} = 1244.0$, the conversions yield:\n$$\nC_{6} = 64.30 \\times 2625.499638 \\times (0.529177210903)^{6} \\approx 3700.0406 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{\\AA}^6\n$$\n$$\nC_{8} = 1244.0 \\times 2625.499638 \\times (0.529177210903)^{8} \\approx 20027.5959 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{\\AA}^8\n$$\nThese converted values for $C_{6}$ and $C_{8}$, along with the provided $C_{10} = 100000.0 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{\\AA}^{10}$ and $b_{\\mathrm{true}} = 2.20 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$, will be used.\n\nNext, we define the mathematical forms of the energy models. The core component is the Tang-Toennies damping function, $f_{n}(x)$, which corrects the simplistic $R^{-n}$ dispersion terms for charge overlap and exchange effects at short range. For an argument $x = bR$, it is defined as:\n$$\nf_{n}(x) = 1 - e^{-x} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{x^{k}}{k!}\n$$\nThis function approaches $1$ as $x \\to \\infty$ (large $R$), recovering the undamped London dispersion form, and approaches $0$ as $x \\to 0$ (small $R$), damping the interaction.\n\nThe synthetic reference dispersion energy, $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}(R)$, is constructed to be a realistic but not perfectly reproducible target. It includes damped $C_{6}$ and $C_{8}$ terms and an additional undamped $C_{10}$ term to represent higher-order effects not present in our fitting model.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ref}}(R) = -\\frac{C_{6}\\,f_{6}(b_{\\mathrm{true}} R)}{R^{6}} - \\frac{C_{8}\\,f_{8}(b_{\\mathrm{true}} R)}{R^{8}} - \\frac{C_{10}}{R^{10}}\n$$\nThis reference energy is calculated for the set of given intermolecular distances $R \\in \\{3.10, 3.30, 3.50, 3.70, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 7.00, 8.00\\}$ $\\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n\nThe model to be fitted, $E_{\\mathrm{model}}(R; b)$, is a simplified version that contains only the damped $C_{6}$ and $C_{8}$ terms. The damping parameter $b$ is the sole parameter to be optimized.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{model}}(R; b) = -\\frac{C_{6}\\,f_{6}(b R)}{R^{6}} - \\frac{C_{8}\\,f_{8}(b R)}{R^{8}}\n$$\nThe discrepancy between $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ (which contains the $C_{10}/R^{10}$ term) and $E_{\\mathrm{model}}$ (which does not) ensures that the fitting problem is non-trivial. The fitted parameter $b$ will attempt to compensate for the missing physics, and its optimal value will depend on which range of $R$ is prioritized in the fit.\n\nThe computational procedure involves a nonlinear least-squares optimization for each of the four specified fitting ranges. For each range, we seek the value of $b$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the model and the reference data points within that range:\n$$\n\\underset{b>0}{\\mathrm{minimize}} \\left( \\mathrm{SSR}(b) \\right) = \\underset{b>0}{\\mathrm{minimize}} \\left( \\sum_{R_{i} \\in \\text{range}} \\left[E_{\\mathrm{model}}(R_{i}; b) - E_{\\mathrm{ref}}(R_{i})\\right]^{2} \\right)\n$$\nThis is a standard numerical optimization task. The constraint $b > 0$ is physically necessary, as the damping parameter must be positive.\n\nAfter obtaining the optimized parameter $b_{j}$ for each fitting range $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, two metrics are computed.\nFirst, the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) is calculated to quantify the overall goodness of fit of the model using the parameter $b_{j}$. Crucially, the RMSE is evaluated over the *entire* set of ten reference data points, regardless of the range used for fitting. This provides a consistent measure of how well a given parameterization performs across the full potential well.\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE}(b_{j}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[E_{\\mathrm{model}}(R_{i}; b_{j}) - E_{\\mathrm{ref}}(R_{i})\\right]^{2}}, \\quad \\text{where } N=10\n$$\nSecond, a sensitivity metric, $\\Delta b$, is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum fitted values of $b$ obtained from the four ranges. This quantifies the instability or dependence of the parameter $b$ on the choice of fitting dataset.\n$$\n\\Delta b = \\max\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, b_{4}\\} - \\min\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, b_{4}\\}\n$$\nThe final output will consist of the sequence of fitted parameters $b_j$ and their corresponding RMSE values, followed by the sensitivity metric $\\Delta b$, all formatted to the required precision.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calibrates the Tang-Toennies damping parameter 'b' by least-squares fitting\n    of a damped dispersion model to a synthetic SAPT reference dispersion dataset.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
