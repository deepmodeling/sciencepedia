We will proceed with rigorous mathematical steps.\n\nFirst, we define the electric field envelope of the pulse as a Gaussian function of time, $t$. A transform-limited pulse has a zero temporal phase, so the envelope can be written as a real function:\n$$E(t) = E_0 \\exp(-a t^2)$$\nwhere $E_0$ is the peak amplitude and $a$ is a positive real constant that determines the pulse duration.\n\nThe intensity of the pulse, $I(t)$, is proportional to the square of the electric field magnitude:\n$$I(t) \\propto |E(t)|^2 = E_0^2 \\exp(-2a t^2)$$\nWe can write this as $I(t) = I_0 \\exp(-2a t^2)$, where $I_0$ is the peak intensity.\n\nThe problem specifies the temporal full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the *intensity* profile, denoted by $\\Delta t$. By definition, the intensity at $t = \\pm \\Delta t / 2$ is half of its maximum value:\n$$I(\\pm \\Delta t / 2) = \\frac{I_0}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the intensity equation:\n$$\\frac{I_0}{2} = I_0 \\exp\\left(-2a \\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a (\\Delta t)^2}{2}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{a (\\Delta t)^2}{2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{a (\\Delta t)^2}{2}$$\nSolving for the constant $a$ yields:\n$$a = \\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{(\\Delta t)^2}$$\nThus, we can express the electric field envelope in terms of the measurable quantity $\\Delta t$:\n$$E(t) = E_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2 \\ln(2)}{(\\Delta t)^2} t^2\\right)$$\n\nNext, we must find the spectral profile by taking the Fourier transform of the electric field envelope.

A solution will be derived.\n\n## Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on the evolution of the density operator, $\\rho$, under the influence of three sequential electric field interactions. The system begins in the ground state population, $\\rho^{(0)} = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$. The electric field of a pulse $j$ is $E_j \\propto e^{i(\\mathbf{k}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)} + c.c.$.\n\nThe signal wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_s$ arises from momentum conservation: $\\mathbf{k}_s = \\sigma_A \\mathbf{k}_A + \\sigma_B \\mathbf{k}_B + \\sigma_C \\mathbf{k}_C$, where $\\sigma_j = \\pm 1$. A positive sign ($\\sigma_j = +1$) corresponds to an interaction with the field component $E_j \\propto e^{i\\mathbf{k}_j\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, while a negative sign ($\\sigma_j = -1$) corresponds to an interaction with the complex conjugate field $E_j^* \\propto e^{-i\\mathbf{k}_j\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$.\n\nWithin the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), an interaction with $E_j$ drives an absorptive transition, acting on the ket side of the density operator: $\\lvert g \\rangle \\rightarrow \\lvert e \\rangle$. An interaction with $E_j^*$ can drive stimulated emission on the ket side, $\\lvert e \\rangle \\rightarrow \\lvert g \\rangle$, or an absorptive transition on the bra side, $\\langle g \\rvert \\rightarrow \\langle e \\rvert$. For the first interaction on the ground state $\\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$, $E_j$ creates the coherence $\\rho_{eg} = \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$, while $E_j^*$ creates the coherence $\\rho_{ge} = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle e \\rvert$.\n\nThe time evolution of a coherence $\\rho_{ab} = \\lvert a \\rangle\\langle b \\rvert$ under the field-free Hamiltonian is governed by $\\dot{\\rho}_{ab} = -i \\omega_{ab} \\rho_{ab}$, where $\\omega_{ab} = \\omega_a - \\omega_b$.\n- For the coherence $\\rho_{eg} = \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$, the evolution is governed by the frequency $\\omega_{eg} = \\omega_e - \\omega_g$. The phase accumulated during a time interval $t$ is $\\exp(-i\\omega_{eg}t)$.\n- For the coherence $\\rho_{ge} = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle e \\rvert$, the evolution is governed by the frequency $\\omega_{ge} = \\omega_g - \\omega_e = -\\omega_{eg}$. The phase accumulated is $\\exp(-i\\omega_{ge}t) = \\exp(+i\\omega_{eg}t)$.\n\nA pathway is defined as **rephasing** if the phase accumulated during $t_1$ has the opposite sign to the phase accumulated during $t_3$. This occurs if the coherence during $t_1$ is the complex conjugate of the coherence during $t_3$ (e.g., $\\rho_{ge}$ then $\\rho_{eg}$).\nA pathway is **nonrephasing** if the phases have the same sign, which occurs if the coherence is of the same type during $t_1$ and $t_3$ (e.g., $\\rho_{eg}$ then $\\rho_{eg}$).\n\n### Analysis of Case I\nThe phase-matching condition is $\\mathbf{k}_s^{(I)} = -\\mathbf{k}_A + \\mathbf{k}_B + \\mathbf{k}_C$. The pulses arrive in the order $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$.\n\n1.  **Interaction 1 (Pulse A)**: The interaction corresponds to $-\\mathbf{k}_A$, meaning an interaction with the complex-conjugated field $E_A^*$. Acting on the initial state $\\rho^{(0)} = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$, this creates the coherence $\\rho^{(1)} = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle e \\rvert = \\rho_{ge}$.\n2.  **Evolution during $t_1$**: The coherence $\\rho_{ge}$ evolves. The phase factor is $\\exp(+i\\omega_{eg}t_1)$.\n3.  **Intermediate Interactions**: Pulse $B$ ($+\\mathbf{k}_B$) and Pulse $C$ ($+\\mathbf{k}_C$) interact with the system. Tracing the full Liouville pathway shows that the system is driven into a population state during $t_2$ and then into the final radiating coherence $\\rho_{eg}$ during $t_3$. For instance, a common pathway is $\\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert \\xrightarrow{A^*} \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle e \\rvert \\xrightarrow{B} \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert \\xrightarrow{C} \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$.\n4.  **Final Coherence**: The final coherence that radiates the signal with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_s$ is $\\rho_{eg}$. Its evolution during $t_3$ is $\\exp(-i\\omega_{eg}t_3)$.\n5.  **Classification**: The phase accumulated during $t_1$ is proportional to $+\\omega_{eg}$, while during $t_3$ it is proportional to $-\\omega_{eg}$. Since the signs are opposite, the pathway is **rephasing**. The phase factor during the $t_1$ period is $\\exp(+ i \\,\\omega_{eg} t_1)$.\n\n### Analysis of Case II\nThe phase-matching condition is $\\mathbf{k}_s^{(II)} = +\\mathbf{k}_A - \\mathbf{k}_B + \\mathbf{k}_C$.\n\n1.  **Interaction 1 (Pulse A)**: The interaction corresponds to $+\\mathbf{k}_A$, meaning an interaction with the field $E_A$. Acting on the initial state $\\rho^{(0)} = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$, this creates the coherence $\\rho^{(1)} = \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert = \\rho_{eg}$.\n2.  **Evolution during $t_1$**: The coherence $\\rho_{eg}$ evolves. The phase factor is $\\exp(-i\\omega_{eg}t_1)$.\n3.  **Intermediate Interactions**: A representative pathway is $\\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert \\xrightarrow{A} \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert \\xrightarrow{B^*} \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle e \\rvert \\xrightarrow{C} \\lvert e \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$. The system is in a population state during $t_2$.\n4.  **Final Coherence**: The final radiating coherence is $\\rho_{eg}$. Its evolution during $t_3$ is $\\exp(-i\\omega_{eg}t_3)$.\n5.  **Classification**: The phase accumulated during $t_1$ is proportional to $-\\omega_{eg}$, and during $t_3$ it is also proportional to $-\\omega_{eg}$. Since the signs are the same, the pathway is **nonrephasing**. The phase factor during the $t_1$ period is $\\exp(- i \\,\\omega_{eg} t_1)$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n- **Case I**: Rephasing, with $\\exp(+ i \\,\\omega_{eg} t_1)$ evolution during $t_1$.\n- **Case II**: Nonrephasing, with $\\exp(- i \\,\\omega_{eg} t_1)$ evolution during $t_1$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A.

We are given the sign convention that in the final absorptive spectrum, SE contributions are positive and ESA contributions are negative.\n\nThe chromophore is modeled as a three-level ladder system with states $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$, and $|2\\rangle$. The relevant transition dipole matrix elements are $\\mu_{01}$ between the ground state $|0\\rangle$ and the one-exciton state $|1\\rangle$, and $\\mu_{12}$ between the one-exciton state $|1\\rangle$ and the two-exciton state $|2\\rangle$. We are given the relation $\\mu_{12} = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mu_{01}$, which is characteristic of a harmonic oscillator model where $\\mu_{v,v+1} \\propto \\sqrt{v+1}$. For this analysis, we assume the dipole matrix elements $\\mu_{01}$ and $\\mu_{12}$ are real and positive without loss of generality.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the Stimulated Emission (SE) pathway. This pathway involves only the first two electronic states, $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. The sequence of events for a rephasing SE pathway is as follows:\n$1$. The first pulse interaction creates a coherence between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n$2$. The second pulse interaction converts this coherence into a population in the excited state, $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$.\n$3$. The third pulse interaction converts this population back into a coherence between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n$4$. This final coherence radiates the signal field.\nEach of these four steps involves a transition between states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. Therefore, the transition dipole matrix element for each step is $\\mu_{01}$ (or its conjugate, which is equal for a real dipole). The amplitude of the SE signal pathway, $A_{\\mathrm{SE}}$, is thus proportional to the product of these four dipole moments:\n$$\n|A_{\\mathrm{SE}}| \\propto \\mu_{01} \\times \\mu_{01} \\times \\mu_{01} \\times \\mu_{01} = \\mu_{01}^4\n$$\nThis pathway contributes to a spectral feature at excitation frequency $\\omega_{01}$ and detection frequency $\\omega_{01}$. According to the problem's convention, this contribution is positive. We normalize this contribution to $+1$, which effectively sets an arbitrary scaling constant.\n\nNext, we analyze the Excited-State Absorption (ESA) pathway. This pathway involves all three states: $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$, and $|2\\rangle$. The sequence of events for a rephasing ESA pathway is:\n$1$. The first pulse interaction creates a coherence between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n$2$. The second pulse interaction converts this coherence into a population in the excited state, $|1\\rangle\\langle1|$.\n$3$. The third pulse interaction excites the system from the populated state $|1\\rangle$ to the state $|2\\rangle$, creating a coherence between $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$.\n$4$. This final coherence radiates the signal field.\nThe first two steps involve the $0 \\leftrightarrow 1$ transition, so they each contribute a factor of $\\mu_{01}$ to the amplitude. The third step is the $1 \\to 2$ transition, contributing a factor of $\\mu_{12}$. The final emission step corresponds to the $2 \\to 1$ transition, also contributing a factor of $\\mu_{12}$. The amplitude of the ESA signal pathway, $A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}$, is therefore proportional to:\n$$\n|A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}| \\propto \\mu_{01} \\times \\mu_{01} \\times \\mu_{12} \\times \\mu_{12} = \\mu_{01}^2 \\mu_{12}^2\n$$\nThis pathway contributes to a spectral feature at excitation frequency $\\omega_{01}$ and detection frequency $\\omega_{12}$. By convention, this contribution is negative.\n\nNow we can find the relative contribution of ESA with respect to the normalized SE contribution. We substitute the given relation $\\mu_{12} = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mu_{01}$ into the expression for the magnitude of the ESA amplitude:\n$$\n|A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}| \\propto \\mu_{01}^2 (\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mu_{01})^2 = \\mu_{01}^2 (2 \\mu_{01}^2) = 2 \\mu_{01}^4\n$$\nThe ratio of the magnitudes of the ESA and SE amplitudes is:\n$$\n\\frac{|A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}|}{|A_{\\mathrm{SE}}|} = \\frac{2 \\mu_{01}^4}{\\mu_{01}^4} = 2\n$$\nThe magnitude of the ESA contribution is twice the magnitude of the SE contribution.\nThe problem requires us to set the normalized SE contribution, $A_{\\mathrm{SE}}$, to $+1$. The ESA contribution has a negative sign and its magnitude is twice that of SE. Therefore, the relative ESA contribution, $A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}$, is $-2$.\n\nFinally, we must determine the net sign of the off-diagonal spectral feature located at excitation frequency $\\omega_{01}$ and detection frequency $\\omega_{12}$. A spectral feature at these coordinates corresponds to a process where energy is absorbed at frequency $\\omega_{01}$ and emitted at frequency $\\omega_{12}$. In our three-level ladder model, this corresponds precisely and exclusively to the ESA pathway ($0 \\to 1$ excitation, followed by $1 \\to 2$ excitation and $2 \\to 1$ emission). The SE and Ground State Bleach (GSB) pathways both result in emission at the same frequency as absorption, $\\omega_{01}$, and thus only contribute to the diagonal peak at $(\\omega_{01}, \\omega_{01})$. Therefore, the off-diagonal peak at $(\\omega_{01}, \\omega_{12})$ is purely due to ESA.\nAccording to the problem's sign convention, the ESA contribution appears with a negative sign. Thus, the net sign of this off-diagonal feature is negative. The parameter $s_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is defined to be $-1$ for a negative feature.\n\nThe final answer consists of the triplet $(A_{\\mathrm{SE}}, A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}, s_{\\mathrm{off}})$.\n- $A_{\\mathrm{SE}}$ is the normalized SE contribution, which is set to $+1$.\n- $A_{\\mathrm{ESA}}$ is the relative ESA contribution, which is $-2$.\n- $s_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is the sign of the off-diagonal feature, which is $-1$.\nSo, the result is $(1, -2, -1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -2 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2684870"}]}
