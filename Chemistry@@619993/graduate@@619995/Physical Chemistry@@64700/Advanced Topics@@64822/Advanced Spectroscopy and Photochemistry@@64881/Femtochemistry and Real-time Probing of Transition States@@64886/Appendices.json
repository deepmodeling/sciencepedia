Near a transition-state region, two diabatic electronic states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ form an avoided crossing as functions of $q$. In the diabatic representation and in the vicinity of the crossing coordinate $q_{c}$, the diabatic potentials are locally linear, $E_{1}(q) \\approx E_{c} + F\\,(q - q_{c})$ and $E_{2}(q) \\approx E_{c} - F\\,(q - q_{c})$, with a constant diabatic electronic coupling $V$.\n\nAssume that the pump prepares a wavepacket that reaches $q_{c}$ with a well-defined mean kinetic energy along $q$ equal to $K$, and that the nuclear motion near $q_{c}$ is well approximated as classical with instantaneous velocity $v_{q}$ given by $v_{q} = \\sqrt{2K/\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass associated with the coordinate $q$. In the diabatic basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$, the nuclear motion maps the time dependence of the diabatic energy difference to $E_{1}(t) - E_{2}(t) \\approx \\alpha t$ with $\\alpha = 2 F v_{q}$, and the coupled time-dependent electronic dynamics near $t=0$ are generated by the $2\\times 2$ Hamiltonian\n$$\nH(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t & V \\\\\nV & -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha t\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nStarting from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the above Hamiltonian, derive the nonadiabatic Landau–Zener transition probability $P_{\\mathrm{LZ}}$ for a single passage through the avoided crossing in terms of $V$, $\\alpha$, and fundamental constants.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem rooted in the fundamental principles of nonadiabatic quantum dynamics. It is a standard model problem in physical chemistry, particularly relevant to the field of femtochemistry as stated. No flaws are identified. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and subsequent numerical evaluation of the Landau-Zener nonadiabatic transition probability, $P_{\\mathrm{LZ}}$.\n\nThe dynamics of the two-level electronic system are governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE):\n$$i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt}|\\Psi(t)\\rangle = H(t)|\\Psi(t)\\rangle$$\nThe electronic state vector $|\\Psi(t)\\rangle$ is expanded in the diabatic basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$ as $|\\Psi(t)\\rangle = c_1(t)|1\\rangle + c_2(t)|2\\rangle$.

The initial conditions are therefore $|c_1(-\\infty)|^2 = 1$ and $|c_2(-\\infty)| = 0$. We wish to find the probability of a nonadiabatic transition.\n\nIn the diabatic representation given, for $t \\to -\\infty$, the state $|1\\rangle$ has energy $E_1 \\to -\\infty$ and state $|2\\rangle$ has energy $E_2 \\to +\\infty$. Thus, $|1\\rangle$ corresponds to the lower adiabatic state at $t \\to -\\infty$. For $t \\to +\\infty$, state $|1\\rangle$ has energy $E_1 \\to +\\infty$ and state $|2\\rangle$ has energy $E_2 \\to -\\infty$. Thus, $|2\\rangle$ corresponds to the lower adiabatic state at $t \\to +\\infty$.\n\nA nonadiabatic transition (a \"hop\") is defined as a transition between adiabatic potential energy surfaces. In this case, it corresponds to the system starting on the lower adiabatic surface (which is diabat $|1\\rangle$ at $t \\to -\\infty$) and ending on the upper adiabatic surface (which is diabat $|1\\rangle$ at $t \\to +\\infty$). Therefore, the nonadiabatic transition probability $P_{\\mathrm{LZ}}$ is the probability of the system remaining in diabatic state $|1\\rangle$ after passing through the crossing region, i.e., $P_{\\mathrm{LZ}} = |c_1(t \\to +\\infty)|^2$.\n\nTo solve the system of equations, one can decouple them to obtain a second-order differential equation, which can be solved using special functions (parabolic cylinder functions). The standard solution, first derived by Landau, Zener, Stueckelberg, and Majorana, gives the probability of the system remaining in the initial diabatic state after a single pass through the crossing region. This is the nonadiabatic transition probability, $P_{\\mathrm{LZ}}$.\nThe result is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{LZ}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi V^2}{\\hbar\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = 2 F v_{q}$, where $v_{q} = \\sqrt{2K/\\mu}$.

This exercise [@problem_id:2640593] addresses the practical challenge of maintaining the shortest possible pulses at the sample, where they can be broadened by dispersion in optics. You will apply the principles of Fourier optics to determine how a pulse shaper can pre-compensate for this broadening, a critical step in designing experiments capable of resolving the fleeting transition states of chemical reactions.", "problem": "In a femtosecond pump–probe experiment designed to resolve the transition state of a unimolecular isomerization, a Gaussian pump pulse is shaped before entering the sample and a Gaussian probe pulse interrogates the induced dynamics. The pump at the shaper input is transform-limited with intensity full width at half maximum (FWHM) $9.0$ fs and central wavelength $800$ nm. The sample cell (windows plus medium) imparts a positive group delay dispersion (GDD) of $+300$ fs$^{2}$ at $800$ nm to the pump. The probe is unaffected by the sample and arrives at the interaction region as a transform-limited Gaussian with intensity FWHM $12.0$ fs. A Fourier-plane pulse shaper imposes a programmable quadratic spectral phase $\\phi_{2}$ (in fs$^{2}$) on the pump before it traverses the sample.\n\nAssume linear propagation, neglect higher-order dispersion and nonlinear effects, and model the electric-field spectrum as Gaussian. The instrument response is set by the intensity cross-correlation of pump and probe at the sample. The goal is to achieve an intensity cross-correlation FWHM of $15.0$ fs at the sample to resolve the transition-state passage.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of Gaussian pulse Fourier transforms, the effect of quadratic spectral phase on temporal width, and the convolution property of Gaussians, determine the single value of the quadratic spectral phase $\\phi_{2}$ that the shaper must apply to the pump so that the target cross-correlation FWHM of $15.0$ fs is achieved at the sample.\n\nExpress your final answer as a signed number in fs$^{2}$, and round to four significant figures. Do not include units in your final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem is first subjected to validation.\n\nGivens:\n1.  Pump pulse at shaper input: Transform-limited Gaussian.\n2.  Initial pump intensity FWHM: $\\tau_{p,in} = 9.0$ fs.\n3.  Pump central wavelength: $800$ nm.\n4.  Sample GDD: $\\phi_{2,sample} = +300$ fs$^2$.\n5.  Probe pulse: Transform-limited Gaussian at sample.\n6.  Probe intensity FWHM: $\\tau_{pr} = 12.0$ fs.\n7.  Shaper GDD: $\\phi_{2}$ (quadratic spectral phase).\n8.  Target intensity cross-correlation FWHM: $\\tau_{XC,target} = 15.0$ fs.\n9.  Assumptions: Linear propagation, neglect of higher-order dispersion, Gaussian electric-field spectrum.\n\nValidation:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard femtosecond pump-probe experiment with pulse shaping, a core technique in physical chemistry. The concepts of Gaussian pulses, group delay dispersion (GDD), and intensity cross-correlation are fundamental to ultrafast optics. The provided values are physically realistic for typical Ti:sapphire laser systems. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to determine a unique value for the requested parameter, $\\phi_{2}$. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-scientific claims. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nSolution:\nThe solution requires establishing three key relationships: (1) the temporal broadening of a Gaussian pulse due to quadratic spectral phase (GDD), (2) the intensity cross-correlation of two Gaussian pulses, and (3) the total GDD experienced by the pump pulse.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between a pulse's temporal width and the quadratic spectral phase (GDD) it accumulates. For a transform-limited Gaussian pulse with an initial intensity FWHM of $\\tau_{in}$, propagating through a medium that imparts a total GDD of $\\phi_{2,total}$, the resulting pulse is chirped and its intensity FWHM, $\\tau_{out}$, is given by the broadening formula:\n$$ \\tau_{out}^2 = \\tau_{in}^2 + \\left(\\frac{4\\ln(2)\\phi_{2,total}}{\\tau_{in}}\\right)^2 = \\tau_{in}^2 + \\frac{(4\\ln(2))^2}{\\tau_{in}^2} \\phi_{2,total}^2 $$\nThis formula arises from the Fourier transform properties of chirped Gaussian functions.\n\nNext, we relate the individual pulse durations to the instrument response function. The instrument response is the intensity cross-correlation of the pump and probe pulses at the sample. The cross-correlation of two Gaussian functions is also a Gaussian function. If the pump pulse has intensity FWHM $\\tau_{p,samp}$ and the probe pulse has intensity FWHM $\\tau_{pr}$ at the sample, the FWHM of their cross-correlation function, $\\tau_{XC}$, is given by the quadrature sum:\n$$ \\tau_{XC}^2 = \\tau_{p,samp}^2 + \\tau_{pr}^2 $$\nWe are given the target cross-correlation FWHM, $\\tau_{XC,target} = 15.0$ fs, and the probe FWHM, $\\tau_{pr} = 12.0$ fs. We can solve for the required pump pulse FWHM at the sample, $\\tau_{p,samp}$:\n$$ (15.0)^2 = \\tau_{p,samp}^2 + (12.0)^2 $$\n$$ 225 = \\tau_{p,samp}^2 + 144 $$\n$$ \\tau_{p,samp}^2 = 225 - 144 = 81 $$\n$$ \\tau_{p,samp} = \\sqrt{81} = 9.0 \\text{ fs} $$\nThe pump pulse must arrive at the sample with an intensity FWHM of $9.0$ fs.\n\nThe pump pulse starts as a transform-limited (TL) pulse with an initial FWHM $\\tau_{p,in} = 9.0$ fs. It then propagates through the pulse shaper, which applies a GDD of $\\phi_2$, and the sample, which applies a GDD of $\\phi_{2,sample} = +300$ fs$^2$. The total GDD experienced by the pump pulse is the sum:\n$$ \\phi_{2,total} = \\phi_2 + \\phi_{2,sample} $$\nWe now use the pulse broadening equation for the pump pulse. Since the required final duration at the sample ($\\tau_{p,samp} = 9.0$ fs) is identical to the initial transform-limited duration ($\\tau_{p,in} = 9.0$ fs), the pulse must arrive at the sample in a transform-limited state. This implies that the total accumulated GDD must be zero.\n$$ \\phi_{2,total} = 0 $$\nWith this condition, we can solve for the shaper GDD, $\\phi_2$:\n$$ 0 = \\phi_2 + \\phi_{2,sample} $$\n$$ 0 = \\phi_2 + 300 \\text{ fs}^2 $$\n$$ \\phi_2 = -300 \\text{ fs}^2 $$\nThe pulse shaper must apply a GDD of $-300$ fs$^2$ to pre-compensate for the positive GDD of the sample, thereby delivering a transform-limited $9.0$ fs pump pulse to the interaction region to achieve the target instrument response function.\n\nThe final answer must be a signed number in fs$^2$ rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $-300$, which is written as $-300.0$ to satisfy the precision requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-300.0}$$", "id": "2640593"}]}
