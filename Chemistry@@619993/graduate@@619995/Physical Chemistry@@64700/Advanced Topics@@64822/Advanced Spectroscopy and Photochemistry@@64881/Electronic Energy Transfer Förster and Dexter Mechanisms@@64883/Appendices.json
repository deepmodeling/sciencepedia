The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise that requires correct application of first principles. No flaws are identified. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the FRET transfer rate $k_F(R)$.\nBased on the first foundational fact, the rate of FRET, $k_F$, is proportional to the inverse sixth power of the donor-acceptor separation, $R$. This can be written as:\n$$k_F(R) = C R^{-6}$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo determine this constant, we use the second foundational fact. The Förster radius, $R_0$, is the distance at which the FRET rate equals the donor's natural decay rate, $k_D$. The natural decay rate is the reciprocal of the unquenched lifetime, $\\tau_D$:\n$$k_D = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D}$$\nBy definition, at $R = R_0$:\n$$k_F(R_0) = k_D = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D}$$\nSubstituting $R = R_0$ into our rate expression gives:\n$$k_F(R_0) = C R_0^{-6}$$\nEquating these two expressions allows us to find $C$:\n$$C R_0^{-6} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\implies C = \\frac{R_0^6}{\\tau_D}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general rate law for $k_F(R)$ yields the final expression for the transfer rate as a function of $R$:\n$$k_F(R) = \\left(\\frac{R_0^6}{\\tau_D}\\right) R^{-6} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^6$$\n\nTask 2: Numerical evaluation of $k_F(R)$.\nThe problem provides the following values: $\\tau_D = 4\\,\\text{ns} = 4 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}$, $R_0 = 6\\,\\text{nm}$, and $R = 5\\,\\text{nm}$. We can substitute these into the derived expression.

According to the third foundational fact, the total decay rate, $k_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the rates of these independent first-order processes:\n$$k_{\\text{total}} = k_D + k_F(R)$$\nThe FRET efficiency, $E$, is defined as the fraction of donor de-excitations that occur via energy transfer. This corresponds to the branching fraction for the FRET channel:\n$$E(R) = \\frac{k_F(R)}{k_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{k_F(R)}{k_D + k_F(R)}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $k_D$ and $k_F(R)$:\n$$E(R) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^6}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_D} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^6}$$\nThe term $1/\\tau_D$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled:\n$$E(R) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^6}{1 + \\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^6}$$\nTo obtain a cleaner form, one can multiply the numerator and denominator by $R^6$:\n$$E(R) = \\frac{R_0^6}{R^6 + R_0^6}$$\nThis is the general expression for FRET efficiency.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values $R = 5\\,\\text{nm}$ and $R_0 = 6\\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$E = \\frac{(6)^6}{(5)^6 + (6)^6} = \\frac{46656}{15625 + 46656} = \\frac{46656}{62281}$$\n$$E \\approx 0.74911319$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$E \\approx 0.7491$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7491}\n$$", "id": "2637333"}, {"introduction": "The strength of the dipole-dipole coupling in FRET is critically dependent on the mutual orientation of the donor and acceptor molecules, a factor captured by the orientation factor, $\\kappa^2$.

We again use propagation of uncertainty. Taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln(R) = \\ln(R_0) + \\frac{1}{6}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-E}{E}\\right) = \\ln(R_0) + \\frac{1}{6}\\left[\\ln(1-E) - \\ln(E)\\right]$$\nThe variance of $\\ln(R)$ is given by the sum of the squared contributions from the independent variables $R_0$ and $E$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln(R)}{\\partial \\ln(R_0)}\\right)^2 (\\sigma_{\\ln(R_0)})^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln(R)}{\\partial E}\\right)^2 \\sigma_E^2$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln(R)}{\\partial \\ln(R_0)} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln(R)}{\\partial E} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{-1}{1-E} - \\frac{1}{E}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{E + 1 - E}{E(1-E)}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{6E(1-E)}$$\nSubstituting these into the variance equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 = (1)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{R_0}}{R_0}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{6E(1-E)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_E^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{R_0}}{R_0}\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{36 E^2 (1-E)^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $(\\sigma_{R_0}/R_0)^2$ from Part 1:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36} \\left(\\varepsilon_{\\kappa^2}^2 + \\varepsilon_{\\Phi_D}^2 + \\varepsilon_{J}^2 + 16\\varepsilon_{n}^2\\right) + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{36 E^2 (1-E)^2}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36} \\left(\\varepsilon_{\\kappa^2}^2 + \\varepsilon_{\\Phi_D}^2 + \\varepsilon_{J}^2 + 16\\varepsilon_{n}^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{E^2 (1-E)^2}\\right)$$\nTaking the square root gives the final expression for the fractional uncertainty of $R$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R} = \\frac{1}{6} \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\kappa^2}^2 + \\varepsilon_{\\Phi_D}^2 + \\varepsilon_{J}^2 + 16\\varepsilon_{n}^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{E^2(1-E)^2}}$$\nThis completes the derivation.
