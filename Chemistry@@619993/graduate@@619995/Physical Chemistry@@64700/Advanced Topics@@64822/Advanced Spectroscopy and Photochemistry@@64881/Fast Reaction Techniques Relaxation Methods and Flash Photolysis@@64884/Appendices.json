First, the general relationship between absorbance change and reaction extent will be derived. Second, this framework will be applied to a specific consecutive first-order reaction scheme to find the time-dependent absorbance and a particular amplitude coefficient.\n\nPart 1: Proportionality of Absorbance Change and Reaction Extent\n\nThe Beer-Lambert law states that the absorbance $A$ of a solution is given by the sum of the contributions from all absorbing species:\n$$A(t) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} c_{i}(t)$$\nwhere $l$ is the optical path length, $\\epsilon_{i}$ is the molar absorptivity of species $\\mathrm{X}_{i}$, and $c_{i}(t)$ is its concentration at time $t$.\n\nThe extent of reaction, $\\xi(t)$, defines the change in the amount of substance for each species. For a homogeneous reaction in a constant volume system, it is more convenient to use the extent of reaction per unit volume, which has units of concentration. We will use the symbol $\\xi(t)$ for this quantity, consistent with common practice in chemical kinetics. The change in concentration of any species $\\mathrm{X}_{i}$ from its initial state ($t=0$) is then related to $\\xi(t)$ by its stoichiometric coefficient $\\nu_{i}$:\n$$\\Delta c_{i}(t) = c_{i}(t) - c_{i}(0) = \\nu_{i} \\xi(t)$$\nThe convention is that $\\nu_{i}$ is negative for reactants and positive for products.\n\nThe change in absorbance, $\\Delta A(t)$, is the difference between the absorbance at time $t$ and the initial absorbance at $t=0$:\n$$\\Delta A(t) = A(t) - A(0) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} c_{i}(t) - l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} c_{i}(0)$$\n$$\\Delta A(t) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} (c_{i}(t) - c_{i}(0)) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} \\Delta c_{i}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta c_{i}(t)$ in terms of the reaction extent:\n$$\\Delta A(t) = l \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i} (\\nu_{i} \\xi(t)) = \\left( l \\sum_{i} \\nu_{i} \\epsilon_{i} \\right) \\xi(t)$$\nThe problem states that only species $\\mathrm{X}_{j}$ has a non-zero molar absorptivity, i.e., $\\epsilon_{j} \\neq 0$ and $\\epsilon_{i} = 0$ for all $i \\neq j$. The sum therefore simplifies to a single term:\n$$\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i} \\epsilon_{i} = \\nu_{j} \\epsilon_{j}$$\nThus, the relationship between the absorbance change and the reaction extent is:\n$$\\Delta A(t) = (l \\nu_{j} \\epsilon_{j}) \\xi(t)$$\nThis shows a direct proportionality between $\\Delta A(t)$ and $\\xi(t)$. The proportionality constant is $l \\nu_{j} \\epsilon_{j}$.\n\nPart 2: Consecutive First-Order Reaction\n\nThe reaction scheme is $\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} \\mathrm{B} \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} \\mathrm{C}$. The corresponding system of rate equations is:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{2}[\\mathrm{B}] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = k_{2}[\\mathrm{B}] $$\nWith the initial conditions $[\\mathrm{A}](0) = [\\mathrm{A}]_{0}$, $[\\mathrm{B}](0)=0$, and $[\\mathrm{C}](0)=0$.\n\nFirst, we solve for $[\\mathrm{A}](t)$. The first equation is a simple first-order decay:\n$$ \\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}^{[\\mathrm{A}](t)} \\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = -k_{1} \\int_{0}^{t} dt' \\implies [\\mathrm{A}](t) = [\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t) $$\nNext, we substitute this result into the rate equation for species $\\mathrm{B}$:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} + k_{2}[\\mathrm{B}] = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{2} dt) = \\exp(k_{2}t)$. Multiplying by $I(t)$ yields:\n$$ \\exp(k_{2}t)\\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} + k_{2}\\exp(k_{2}t)[\\mathrm{B}] = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp(-k_{1}t)\\exp(k_{2}t) $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( [\\mathrm{B}]\\exp(k_{2}t) \\right) = k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t) $$\nIntegrating from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$, assuming $k_{1} \\neq k_{2}$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}](t)\\exp(k_{2}t) - [\\mathrm{B}](0)\\exp(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} \\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t') dt' $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}](t)\\exp(k_{2}t) = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} \\left[ \\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t') \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} (\\exp((k_{2}-k_{1})t) - 1) $$\nUsing $[\\mathrm{B}](0)=0$ and multiplying by $\\exp(-k_{2}t)$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{B}](t) = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} (\\exp(-k_{1}t) - \\exp(-k_{2}t)) $$\nThe problem states that only species $\\mathrm{B}$ absorbs light. The absorbance is $A(t) = \\epsilon_{B} l [\\mathrm{B}](t)$. The initial absorbance is $A(0) = \\epsilon_{B} l [\\mathrm{B}](0) = 0$.\nThe absorbance change is $\\Delta A(t) = A(t) - A(0) = A(t)$:\n$$ \\Delta A(t) = \\epsilon_{B} l \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} (\\exp(-k_{1}t) - \\exp(-k_{2}t)) $$\nThis expression is a sum of two decaying exponentials.

Since $k_{1} > k_{2}$, the fast rate is $k_{\\text{fast}} = k_{1}$ and the slow rate is $k_{\\text{slow}} = k_{2}$.\nWe match the derived expression to the canonical form $\\Delta A(t) = \\alpha_{\\text{fast}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{fast}} t) + \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} \\exp(-k_{\\text{slow}} t)$.\nThe amplitude coefficient of the fast term, $\\exp(-k_{1}t)$, is:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{fast}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{B} l k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{2}-k_{1}} $$\nThe amplitude coefficient of the slow term, $\\exp(-k_{2}t)$, is:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{B} l k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]_{0}}{k_{1}-k_{2}} $$\nNote that since $[\\mathrm{B}](0)=0$, we must have $\\Delta A(0)=0$. Evaluating our expression at $t=0$ gives $\\Delta A(0) = \\alpha_{\\text{fast}} + \\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$, which indeed equals zero, confirming the consistency of our coefficients.\n\nFinal Calculation of $\\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$\n\nWe are required to compute the value of $\\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$ using the provided parameters:\n$k_{1} = 2.50 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{2} = 1.00 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$[\\mathrm{A}]_{0} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{M}$\n$\\epsilon_{B} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$\n$l = 1.00 \\ \\text{cm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{slow}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\text{M}^{-1} \\text{cm}^{-1})(1.00 \\ \\text{cm})(2.50 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{s}^{-1})(4.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{M})}{(2.50 \\times 10^{5} - 1.00 \\times 10^{5}) \\ \\text{s}^{-1}} $$\nFirst, evaluate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1.20 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (1.00) \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (4.00 \\times 10^{-6}) $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1.20 \\times 2.50 \\times 4.00) \\times (10^{4} \\times 10^{5} \\times 10^{-6}) = 12.0 \\times 10^{3} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4} $$\nNext, evaluate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 2.50 \\times 10^{5} - 1.00 \\times 10^{5} = 1.50 \\times 10^{5} $$\nNow, compute the ratio:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{4}}{1.50 \\times 10^{5}} = 0.08 $$\nThe calculation results in an exact value of 0.08.

The elements of this matrix are defined as $I_{jk} = -\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_j \\partial \\theta_k}\\right]$, where $\\theta_j$ and $\\theta_k$ are any two components of the parameter vector $\\theta$. A standard result for the Poisson distribution is that the Fisher Information Matrix has elements:\n$$\nI_{jk} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_k}\n$$\nNow, we analyze the weighted least-squares objective function $S_W(\\theta)$:\n$$\nS_W(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \\big[y_i - \\mu_i(\\theta)\\big]^2\n$$\nThe minimization of $S_W$ is typically performed using an iterative method like the Gauss-Newton algorithm. This algorithm approximates the Hessian of the objective function $S_W$. The Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian, $H^{GN}$, has elements:\n$$\nH^{GN}_{jk} \\approx 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_k}\n$$\nLocal equivalence between MLE and WLS, and thus asymptotic efficiency for the WLS estimator, is achieved when the WLS algorithm effectively replicates the MLE optimization. This occurs when the curvature of the objective functions are equivalent. Specifically, the Gauss-Newton Hessian of the WLS objective, $H^{GN}$, should be proportional to the Fisher information matrix, $I$, of the likelihood function.\n$$\nH^{GN} \\propto I\n$$\nBy comparing the expressions for their matrix elements:\n$$\n2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_k} \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{\\mu_i} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta_k}\n$$\nThis proportionality holds if we choose the weights $w_i$ such that $w_i \\propto 1/\\mu_i$. The optimal choice is to set the weights equal to the inverse of the variance for a Poisson distribution ($w_i = 1/\\mathrm{Var}(y_i) = 1/\\mu_i$).\n$$\nw_i^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_i}\n$$\nThis choice of weights transforms the WLS objective into the Pearson chi-squared statistic, $S_W = \\sum_i \\frac{(y_i - \\mu_i)^2}{\\mu_i}$, whose minimization is known to be asymptotically equivalent to maximizing the likelihood for Poisson data.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit form of the optimal weight $w_i^{\\star}$. Substituting the given expression for $\\mu_i$:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\Delta t \\big(A \\exp(-t_i/\\tau) + B\\big)\n$$\nThe optimal weight $w_i^{\\star}$ is therefore:\n$$\nw_i^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t \\big(A \\exp(-t_i/\\tau) + B\\big)}\n$$\nThis weight depends on the unknown parameters, implying that the practical fitting procedure must be iterative, for example using an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm where the weights are updated using the parameter estimates from the previous step.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\Delta t \\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_i}{\\tau}\\right) + B\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "2640227"}]}
