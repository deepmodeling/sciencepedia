It describes the standard model for dynamic fluorescence quenching, providing all necessary parameters and relations to derive the Stern-Volmer equation and perform the requested calculation. All provided values are physically realistic. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe depopulation of the excited singlet state, $S^{\\ast}$, follows a kinetic rate law that accounts for all decay pathways. The concentration of the quencher, $[Q]$, is assumed to be much greater than the concentration of the excited state, $[S^{\\ast}]$, and thus remains effectively constant. Consequently, the bimolecular quenching process behaves as a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to $[S^{\\ast}]$. The overall rate of decay of the excited state is given by the differential equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{d[S^{\\ast}]}{dt} = k_{r}[S^{\\ast}] + k_{nr}[S^{\\ast}] + k_{q}[Q][S^{\\ast}]\n$$\nThis equation can be simplified by factoring out $[S^{\\ast}]$:\n$$\n-\\frac{d[S^{\\ast}]}{dt} = (k_{r} + k_{nr} + k_{q}[Q])[S^{\\ast}]\n$$\nThe expression in the parentheses represents the total pseudo-first-order rate constant for the decay of $S^{\\ast}$, which we denote as $k_{tot}$.\n$$\nk_{tot} = k_{r} + k_{nr} + k_{q}[Q]\n$$\nThe excited-state lifetime, $\\tau$, is defined as the reciprocal of the total decay rate constant:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{tot}} = \\frac{1}{k_{r} + k_{nr} + k_{q}[Q]}\n$$\nThis equation describes the dependence of the lifetime $\\tau$ on the quencher concentration $[Q]$.\n\nTo express this in terms of the lifetime in the absence of the quencher, $\\tau_{0}$, we first define $\\tau_{0}$. When $[Q]=0$, the total decay rate constant is simply $k_{r} + k_{nr}$. Therefore, $\\tau_{0}$ is:\n$$\n\\tau_{0} = \\frac{1}{k_{r} + k_{nr}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\tau$, we can first write the expression for $1/\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = (k_{r} + k_{nr}) + k_{q}[Q] = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} + k_{q}[Q]\n$$\nSolving for $\\tau$ gives its dependence on $[Q]$ in the requested terms:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} + k_{q}[Q]} = \\frac{\\tau_{0}}{1 + k_{q}\\tau_{0}[Q]}\n$$\nThe problem states that the steady-state fluorescence intensity, $I$, is proportional to the fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_{f}$, which in turn is proportional to the lifetime, $\\tau$. The fluorescence quantum yield is the ratio of the rate of radiative emission to the total rate of decay, $\\Phi_{f} = k_{r}/k_{tot} = k_{r}\\tau$. Since the rate of excitation is held constant (constant absorbance), the steady-state intensity $I$ is directly proportional to the quantum yield. Thus, $I \\propto \\Phi_f \\propto \\tau$.

We calculate the ratio $\\tau_0/\\tau$ for each quencher concentration:\n- For $[Q] = 0.001 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = \\frac{4.00}{3.57143} \\approx 1.12000$\n- For $[Q] = 0.002 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = \\frac{4.00}{3.22581} \\approx 1.24000$\n- For $[Q] = 0.003 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = \\frac{4.00}{2.94118} \\approx 1.36000$\n- For $[Q] = 0.004 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = \\frac{4.00}{2.70270} \\approx 1.48000$\n- For $[Q] = 0.005 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = \\frac{4.00}{2.50000} = 1.60000$\nPlotting $\\tau_0/\\tau$ versus $[Q]$ yields a set of points that lie on a straight line passing through $(0, 1)$. The slope of this line is $K_{SV}$. We can calculate the slope from any two points. For example, using the endpoints:\n$$K_{SV} = \\frac{\\Delta(\\tau_0/\\tau)}{\\Delta[Q]} = \\frac{1.60000 - 1.12000}{0.005 \\, \\text{M} - 0.001 \\, \\text{M}} = \\frac{0.48000}{0.004 \\, \\text{M}} = 120.0 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$$\nThe calculation yields a consistent value of $120.0 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$ for all data pairs, indicating the data perfectly fits the dynamic quenching model. Thus, $K_{SV} = 120.0 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$.\n\nPart 2: Static Quenching and the Determination of $K_s$\n\nStatic quenching arises from the formation of a non-fluorescent ground-state complex, $FQ$, between the fluorophore $F$ and the quencher $Q$. The process is described by a $1{:}1$ association equilibrium:\n$$F + Q \\rightleftharpoons FQ$$\nThe equilibrium constant for this association, $K_s$, is given by:\n$$K_s = \\frac{[FQ]}{[F][Q]}$$\nwhere $[F]$ and $[FQ]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free fluorophore and the complex, respectively. The total concentration of the fluorophore species is $[F]_{total} = [F] + [FQ]$. The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the concentration of the fluorophore that can be excited, which is only the free form, $[F]$. In the absence of quencher, $[Q]=0$, so $[F]_{total} = [F]$ and the intensity is $I_0$. In the presence of quencher, only the fraction of fluorophores that remains uncomplexed can contribute to the fluorescence signal.\n\nThe fraction of free fluorophore, $f_{free}$, is given by $f_{free} = \\frac{[F]}{[F]_{total}}$. From the equilibrium expression, we have $[FQ] = K_s[F][Q]$. Substituting into the expression for $[F]_{total}$:\n$$[F]_{total} = [F] + K_s[F][Q] = [F](1 + K_s[Q])$$\nThe ratio of total to free fluorophore concentration is therefore:\n$$\\frac{[F]_{total}}{[F]} = 1 + K_s[Q]$$\nIf only static quenching were present, the intensity ratio $I_0/I$ would be equal to this concentration ratio, as $I_0 \\propto [F]_{total}$ and $I \\propto [F]$.\n\nHowever, in this system, both static and dynamic quenching occur simultaneously. The total effect on steady-state intensity $I$ is a product of both mechanisms. The static quenching reduces the concentration of molecules available for excitation, and dynamic quenching reduces the quantum yield of the molecules that are excited.\nThe observed intensity $I$ is related to the unquenched intensity $I_0$ by:\n$$\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{static} \\times \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{dynamic}$$\nThe dynamic quenching term affects intensity in the same way it affects lifetime: $(\\frac{I_0}{I})_{dynamic} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = 1 + K_{SV}[Q]$.\nThe static quenching term is due to the fraction of non-fluorescent complexes formed: $(\\frac{I_0}{I})_{static} = \\frac{[F]_{total}}{[F]} = 1 + K_s[Q]$.\nCombining these results in the modified Stern-Volmer equation for mixed quenching:\n$$\\frac{I_0}{I} = (1 + K_s[Q])(1 + K_{SV}[Q])$$\nWe have already determined the term $(1 + K_{SV}[Q])$ from the lifetime measurements, which is equal to $\\tau_0/\\tau$. We can therefore isolate the static contribution by rearranging the equation:\n$$\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau} = 1 + K_s[Q]$$\nThis provides the desired linear relationship. Plotting the quantity $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau}$ versus $[Q]$ should yield a straight line with an intercept of $1$ and a slope equal to the static association constant, $K_s$.\n\nWe now apply this to the data. We use the previously calculated $\\tau_0/\\tau$ values and calculate $I_0/I$ values, with $I_0 = 1.000$.\n- For $[Q] = 0.001 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{1.000}{0.826446} \\approx 1.21000$; $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau} = \\frac{1.21000}{1.12000} \\approx 1.08036$\n- For $[Q] = 0.002 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{1.000}{0.695652} \\approx 1.43750$; $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau} = \\frac{1.43750}{1.24000} \\approx 1.15927$\n- For $[Q] = 0.003 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{1.000}{0.592417} \\approx 1.68800$; $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau} = \\frac{1.68800}{1.36000} \\approx 1.24118$\n- For $[Q] = 0.004 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{1.000}{0.511945} \\approx 1.95333$; $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau} = \\frac{1.95333}{1.48000} \\approx 1.31982$\n- For $[Q] = 0.005 \\, \\text{M}$: $\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{1.000}{0.446429} \\approx 2.24000$; $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau} = \\frac{2.24000}{1.60000} = 1.40000$\n\nA linear regression of $\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau}$ versus $[Q]$ will give the slope $K_s$.\nUsing the endpoints to calculate the slope:\n$$K_s = \\frac{\\Delta\\left(\\frac{I_0/I}{\\tau_0/\\tau}\\right)}{\\Delta[Q]} = \\frac{1.40000 - 1.08036}{0.005 \\, \\text{M} - 0.001 \\, \\text{M}} = \\frac{0.31964}{0.004 \\, \\text{M}} \\approx 79.91 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$$\nA formal linear least-squares fit on all five data points yields a slope of $80.00 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$ with an intercept very close to $1$. The small deviations suggest minor rounding in the provided data, but the underlying model holds. The data is consistent with $K_s = 80.00 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$.\n\nThe determined constants, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Dynamic Stern-Volmer constant: $K_{SV} = 120.0 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$\n- Static association constant: $K_s = 80.00 \\, \\text{M}^{-1}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n120.0 & 80.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2642070"}]}
