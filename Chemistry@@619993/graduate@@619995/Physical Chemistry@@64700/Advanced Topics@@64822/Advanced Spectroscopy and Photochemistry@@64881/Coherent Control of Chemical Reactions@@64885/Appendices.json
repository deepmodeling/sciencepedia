The state of the system is described by the density matrix $\\rho$ in the basis $\\{\\lvert g \\rangle, \\lvert e \\rangle\\}$. The initial state at time $t=0$ is $\\rho(0) = \\lvert g \\rangle\\langle g \\rvert$, which in matrix form is:\n$$\n\\rho(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, the matrix representation is $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} \\rho_{gg} & \\rho_{ge} \\\\ \\rho_{eg} & \\rho_{ee} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**1. Evolution under the first pulse:**\nThe Hamiltonian in the rotating frame under the RWA is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\text{pulse}} = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Delta & \\Omega_{R} \\\\ \\Omega_{R} & \\Delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe evolution operator for a pulse of duration $\\tau$ is $U(\\tau) = \\exp(-i H_{\\text{pulse}} \\tau / \\hbar)$. Let the effective Rabi frequency be $\\Omega_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{\\Omega_{R}^2 + \\Delta^2}$ and the pulse area be $\\theta = \\Omega_{\\text{eff}} \\tau$. The unitary operator is:\n$$\nU(\\tau) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) + i\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) & i\\frac{\\Omega_{R}}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\\\ i\\frac{\\Omega_{R}}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) & \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) - i\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet's denote the matrix elements as $U_{gg}$, $U_{ge}$, $U_{eg}$, $U_{ee}$.

Evolution under the second pulse:**\nThe second pulse is identical to the first. The final density matrix $\\rho_f$ is $\\rho_f = U(\\tau) \\rho_2 U(\\tau)^{\\dagger}$. We are interested in the final excited-state population $P_e = (\\rho_f)_{ee}$.\n$$\nP_e = (U \\rho_2 U^\\dagger)_{ee} = |U_{eg}|^2 \\rho_{gg,2} + |U_{ee}|^2 \\rho_{ee,2} + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ U_{ee} U_{eg}^{*} \\rho_{eg,2} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\rho_2$ elements:\n$$\nP_e = |U_{eg}|^2 \\rho_{gg,1} + |U_{ee}|^2 \\rho_{ee,1} + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ U_{ee} U_{eg}^{*} \\rho_{eg,1} \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t - \\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nUsing $\\rho_{gg,1}=|U_{ee}|^2$, $\\rho_{ee,1}=|U_{eg}|^2$, and $\\rho_{eg,1}=U_{eg}U_{ee}$:\n$$\nP_e = |U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + |U_{ee}|^2 |U_{eg}|^2 + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ U_{ee} U_{eg}^{*} (U_{eg} U_{ee}) \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t - \\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP_e = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + 2 \\text{Re}\\left[ (U_{ee})^2 |U_{eg}|^2 \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t - \\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nLet a complex number $Z(\\Delta) = (U_{ee})^2 |U_{eg}|^2$. The expression for $P_e$ becomes:\n$$\nP_e(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + 2 \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\text{Re}\\left[ Z(\\Delta) \\exp(i\\Delta \\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nLet's express $Z(\\Delta)$ in polar form, $Z(\\Delta) = |Z(\\Delta)| \\exp(i\\delta(\\Delta))$. Then the real part becomes $|Z(\\Delta)|\\cos(\\Delta\\Delta t + \\delta(\\Delta))$. We note that $|Z(\\Delta)| = |(U_{ee})^2| |U_{eg}|^2 = |U_{ee}|^2 |U_{eg}|^2$.\n$$\nP_e(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 + 2 |U_{ee}|^2 |U_{eg}|^2 \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\cos(\\Delta\\Delta t + \\delta(\\Delta))\n$$\nLet's define $C(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2$. This term represents the amplitude of the population transfer.\n$$\nP_e(\\Delta) = C(\\Delta) \\left[ 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\cos(\\Delta\\Delta t + \\delta(\\Delta)) \\right]\n$$\nThe problem defines visibility $V$ by finding the maximum and minimum of $P_e$ as $\\Delta$ is scanned. The expression for $P_e(\\Delta)$ describes oscillations with a frequency given by $\\Delta t$ and a phase $\\delta(\\Delta)$, modulated by an envelope function $C(\\Delta)$. Both $C(\\Delta)$ and $\\delta(\\Delta)$ depend on $\\Delta$ through $\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}$ and $\\theta$.\nThe standard definition of visibility in interferometry refers to the contrast of the fast oscillations at a given point in the slowly varying envelope. We adopt this physically meaningful interpretation. For a given $\\Delta$, the population oscillates as a function of the interferometric phase. The extrema $P_{\\max}$ and $P_{\\min}$ are the values of the fringe envelope at that $\\Delta$.\nThus, for any given (local) $\\Delta$:\n$$\nP_{\\max}(\\Delta) = C(\\Delta) \\left[ 1 + \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\min}(\\Delta) = C(\\Delta) \\left[ 1 - \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t) \\right]\n$$\nNow we apply the definition of visibility $V$:\n$$\nV = \\frac{P_{\\max} - P_{\\min}}{P_{\\max} + P_{\\min}} = \\frac{C(\\Delta)[2\\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)]}{C(\\Delta)[2]} = \\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)\n$$\nThe visibility $V$ is a direct measure of the remaining coherence after the free evolution period $\\Delta t$ and is independent of the pulse parameters $\\Omega_R$ and $\\Delta$, provided the pulses create some coherence ($C(\\Delta) \\neq 0$). The problem's request for the expression in terms of $\\Delta$ and $\\Omega_R$ is satisfied by a function that has zero partial derivatives with respect to these variables.\n\n**Condition for Maximal Contrast:**\nThe contrast of the fringes may be defined as $K = P_{\\max} - P_{\\min} = 2C(\\Delta)\\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)$. To maximize this contrast, one must maximize the fringe amplitude function $C(\\Delta)$.\n$$\nC(\\Delta) = 2|U_{eg}|^2 |U_{ee}|^2 = 2 \\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta) \\rho_{gg,1}(\\Delta) = 2 \\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta) (1-\\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta))\n$$\nThis function of $\\rho_{ee,1}$ is maximized when $\\rho_{ee,1}(\\Delta) = 1/2$. This corresponds to the first pulse creating an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. The condition is:\n$$\n\\rho_{ee,1} = \\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R}{\\Omega_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis condition is most straightforwardly met on resonance ($\\Delta=0$), where $\\Omega_{\\text{eff}} = \\Omega_R$ and $\\theta = \\Omega_R \\tau$. The condition becomes $\\sin^2(\\Omega_R \\tau/2) = 1/2$, which implies $\\Omega_R \\tau/2 = \\pi/4$, or $\\Omega_R \\tau = \\pi/2$. Thus, the contrast is maximal for resonant $\\pi/2$-pulses.\nThe final answer required is only the expression for $V$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(-\\gamma_{\\phi}\\Delta t)}\n$$", "id": "2629814"}, {"introduction": "Having established the principles of quantum interference, we now apply them to a tangible chemical event: the breaking of a molecular bond.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Kinetic Energy Release (KER)**\n\nThe total energy of the system on the excited electronic state, $E_{e}$, is conserved. It is the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy $T(R)$ and the potential energy $V_{e}(R)$.\n$$E_{e} = T(R) + V_{e}(R)$$\nAt the moment of the dump transition at internuclear separation $R_{d}$, the kinetic energy of the nuclei on the excited state is:\n$$T(R_{d}) = E_{e} - V_{e}(R_{d})$$\nThe dump transition to the ground-state fragment channel $i$ is vertical. This means it occurs at a fixed nuclear configuration $R_{d}$ and with conservation of nuclear kinetic energy. Immediately after the transition, the system is on the ground state potential surface $V_{g,i}(R)$ at the same position $R_{d}$ and with the same kinetic energy $T(R_{d})$. The total energy on this ground state channel, $E_{g,i}$, is therefore:\n$$E_{g,i} = T(R_{d}) + V_{g,i}(R_{d})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T(R_{d})$:\n$$E_{g,i} = (E_{e} - V_{e}(R_{d})) + V_{g,i}(R_{d}) = E_{e} - (V_{e}(R_{d}) - V_{g,i}(R_{d}))$$\nAs the fragments separate, their internuclear distance $R$ approaches infinity ($R \\to \\infty$). The potential energy approaches the asymptotic energy of the fragment channel, $V_{g,i}(\\infty)$. The kinetic energy release, $\\mathrm{KER}_{i}$, is the kinetic energy of the fragments at this limit. By conservation of energy on the ground state surface:\n$$E_{g,i} = \\mathrm{KER}_{i} + V_{g,i}(\\infty)$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{KER}_{i}$ and substituting the expression for $E_{g,i}$ yields the general relation:\n$$\\mathrm{KER}_{i} = E_{g,i} - V_{g,i}(\\infty) = E_{e} - (V_{e}(R_{d}) - V_{g,i}(R_{d})) - V_{g,i}(\\infty)$$\nThis expression connects the KER to the excited-state total energy $E_{e}$, the potential energy gap at the dump position $R_{d}$, and the ground-state asymptote $V_{g,i}(\\infty)$. The dump position is determined by the propagation time, $R_{d}=R(t_{d})$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Condon Point**\n\nThe dump pulse is resonant at the Condon point $R_{1}^{*}$, where the photon energy $\\hbar\\omega_{d}$ matches the local vertical energy gap between the excited state and ground state channel $1$, $\\Delta_{1}(R_{1}^{*})$.\n$$\\hbar\\omega_{d} = \\Delta_{1}(R_{1}^{*}) = V_{e}(R_{1}^{*}) - V_{g,1}(R_{1}^{*})$$\nUsing the provided linear approximation for the energy gap:\n$$\\Delta_{1}(R) \\approx \\Delta_{1} + \\alpha(R-R_{0})$$\nWe set $R=R_{1}^{*}$ and solve for the displacement $(R_{1}^{*} - R_{0})$.\n$$\\hbar\\omega_{d} = \\Delta_{1} + \\alpha(R_{1}^{*} - R_{0})$$\n$$R_{1}^{*} - R_{0} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{d} - \\Delta_{1}}{\\alpha}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$R_{1}^{*} - R_{0} = \\frac{1.55\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 1.75\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{-0.0500\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}} = \\frac{-0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{-0.0500\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}} = 4.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nThe Condon point is located at a distance of $4.0\\,\\text{\\AA}$ beyond the initial separation $R_{0}$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Pump-Dump Delay**\n\nThe wavepacket center propagates on the excited state according to $R(t) = R_{0} + vt$. The pump-dump delay, $t_d$, is the time required for the wavepacket center to travel from $R_{0}$ to $R_{1}^{*}$.\n$$R(t_{d}) = R_{1}^{*} \\implies R_{0} + vt_{d} = R_{1}^{*}$$\nSolving for $t_{d}$:\n$$t_{d} = \\frac{R_{1}^{*} - R_{0}}{v}$$\nFirst, the speed $v$ must be calculated from $v=\\sqrt{2T_{0}/\\mu}$.

However, the control is restricted by the following two constraints:\n- A spectral constraint: the control field is restricted to a single monochromatic carrier $\\varepsilon(t) = E_0 \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi)$ over $t \\in [0,T]$, where $\\omega_c$ is fixed and $\\phi$ is a constant phase. Let the detuning be $\\Delta \\equiv \\omega_c - \\omega_0$.\n- An amplitude constraint: the field amplitude $E_0$ is bounded such that the corresponding on-resonance Rabi frequency $\\Omega \\equiv \\mu E_0/\\hbar$ satisfies $0 \\le \\Omega \\le \\Omega_{\\max}$.\n\nStarting only from the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation, the dipole interaction model, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA, Rotating-Wave Approximation), do the following:\n1. Transform to an appropriate rotating frame and, under the RWA, derive the driven two-level dynamics in terms of the effective Hamiltonian parameters $\\Delta$ and $\\Omega$, and obtain the excited-state population $P_e(T)$ as a function of $\\Delta$, $\\Omega$, $T$, and $\\phi$ for the initial condition $\\lvert \\psi(0)\\rangle=\\lvert g \\rangle$.\n2. Maximize $P_e(T)$ over $T \\ge 0$ and $\\phi$ for a fixed $\\Omega$ and $\\Delta$, and then maximize over $\\Omega$ subject to $0 \\le \\Omega \\le \\Omega_{\\max}$ to obtain the best achievable population $P_e^{\\star}$ under the constraints. Explain why the resulting maximizer is a constrained stationary point within the feasible set, yet it is suboptimal compared to the unconstrained global optimum $P_e=1$, thereby constituting a false trap introduced by the constraints.\n3. For a concrete counterexample, take $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{THz}$, fix $\\omega_c = \\omega_0 + 2\\pi \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$ so that $\\Delta = 2\\pi \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, and impose $\\Omega_{\\max} = 2\\pi \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$. Compute the resulting $P_e^{\\star}$ as a decimal fraction.\n\nRound your final numerical answer to four significant figures. Report only the maximal excited-state population as a unitless decimal fraction (do not use a percentage sign). The final answer must be a single number.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to scrutiny and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in quantum dynamics, based on established scientific principles, with all necessary information provided and no internal contradictions.\n\nThe task is to analyze the coherent control of a two-level system under specific constraints. We begin with the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE) and the given Hamiltonian, proceed to derive the excited-state population, perform the required optimization, and discuss the result.\n\nThe state of the system is a superposition $\\lvert \\psi(t)\\rangle = c_e(t)\\lvert e \\rangle + c_g(t)\\lvert g \\rangle$. In the basis $\\{\\lvert e \\rangle, \\lvert g \\rangle\\}$, represented by vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ respectively, the total Hamiltonian is\n$$ H(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2}\\sigma_z - \\mu \\varepsilon(t)\\,\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} & -\\mu E_0 \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi) \\\\ -\\mu E_0 \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi) & -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe TDSE is $i\\hbar \\,\\partial_t \\lvert \\psi(t)\\rangle = H(t)\\lvert \\psi(t)\\rangle$.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we transform to a rotating frame that oscillates at the carrier frequency $\\omega_c$ of the control field. This is achieved via the unitary transformation $U(t) = \\exp(-i \\frac{\\omega_c t}{2} \\sigma_z)$. The state vector in the rotating frame is $\\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(t)\\rangle = U^\\dagger(t)\\lvert \\psi(t)\\rangle$. The dynamics of $\\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(t)\\rangle$ are governed by the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame, $\\tilde{H}(t)$, given by\n$$ \\tilde{H}(t) = U^\\dagger(t) H(t) U(t) + i\\hbar (\\partial_t U^\\dagger(t)) U(t) $$\nThe term $i\\hbar (\\partial_t U^\\dagger(t)) U(t)$ evaluates to $-\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_c}{2}\\sigma_z$. The main Hamiltonian transforms as\n$$ U^\\dagger(t) H(t) U(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2} U^\\dagger(t)\\sigma_z U(t) - \\mu E_0 \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi) U^\\dagger(t)\\sigma_x U(t) $$\nSince $\\sigma_z$ commutes with $U(t)$, $U^\\dagger(t)\\sigma_z U(t) = \\sigma_z$. The transformation of $\\sigma_x$ is $U^\\dagger(t)\\sigma_x U(t) = \\sigma_x \\cos(\\omega_c t) + \\sigma_y \\sin(\\omega_c t)$.\nCombining these results, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame is\n$$ \\tilde{H}(t) = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_0}{2}\\sigma_z - \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_c}{2}\\sigma_z - \\mu E_0 \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi)[\\sigma_x \\cos(\\omega_c t) + \\sigma_y \\sin(\\omega_c t)] $$\n$$ \\tilde{H}(t) = -\\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_c - \\omega_0)}{2}\\sigma_z - \\mu E_0 [\\sigma_x \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi)\\cos(\\omega_c t) + \\sigma_y \\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi)\\sin(\\omega_c t)] $$\nUsing product-to-sum trigonometric identities, we expand the interaction term.\n$\\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi)\\cos(\\omega_c t) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(2\\omega_c t + \\phi) + \\cos(\\phi))$.\n$\\cos(\\omega_c t + \\phi)\\sin(\\omega_c t) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sin(2\\omega_c t + \\phi) - \\sin(\\phi))$.\nThe rotating-wave approximation (RWA) consists of neglecting the terms that oscillate at the high frequency $2\\omega_c$, as their effect averages to zero over the timescale of the system's evolution. This approximation is valid when the driving is near resonance and not excessively strong, i.e., $\\Omega, |\\Delta| \\ll \\omega_c, \\omega_0$. The time-independent RWA Hamiltonian, $\\tilde{H}_{RWA}$, becomes\n$$ \\tilde{H}_{RWA} = -\\frac{\\hbar (\\omega_c - \\omega_0)}{2}\\sigma_z - \\frac{\\mu E_0}{2}[\\sigma_x \\cos(\\phi) - \\sigma_y \\sin(\\phi)] $$\nSubstituting the definitions for the detuning $\\Delta = \\omega_c - \\omega_0$ and the on-resonance Rabi frequency $\\Omega = \\mu E_0/\\hbar$, we have\n$$ \\tilde{H}_{RWA} = -\\frac{\\hbar \\Delta}{2}\\sigma_z - \\frac{\\hbar \\Omega}{2}[\\sigma_x \\cos(\\phi) - \\sigma_y \\sin(\\phi)] $$\nIn matrix form, using the Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_{RWA} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Delta & -\\Omega(\\cos\\phi + i\\sin\\phi) \\\\ -\\Omega(\\cos\\phi - i\\sin\\phi) & \\Delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Delta & -\\Omega e^{i\\phi} \\\\ -\\Omega e^{-i\\phi} & \\Delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe evolution of the state in the rotating frame is given by the time-independent TDSE $i\\hbar \\,\\partial_t \\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(t)\\rangle = \\tilde{H}_{RWA} \\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(t)\\rangle$. The solution is $\\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(t)\\rangle = \\exp(-i \\tilde{H}_{RWA} t / \\hbar) \\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(0)\\rangle$.\nThe initial condition is $\\lvert \\psi(0)\\rangle = \\lvert g \\rangle$, which is unchanged by the transformation at $t=0$, so $\\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(0)\\rangle = \\lvert g \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo compute the exponential of the matrix, we use the identity $\\exp(i\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}) = \\cos(|\\vec{a}|)I + i \\sin(|\\vec{a}|)\\frac{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}}{|\\vec{a}|}$.\nHere, $-i\\tilde{H}_{RWA}t/\\hbar = -i \\frac{t}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Delta & -\\Omega e^{i\\phi} \\\\ -\\Omega e^{-i\\phi} & \\Delta \\end{pmatrix}$. We can write $\\tilde{H}_{RWA} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$ with $\\vec{v} = (-\\Omega \\cos\\phi, \\Omega \\sin\\phi, -\\Delta)$. The magnitude is $|\\vec{v}| = \\sqrt{\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2} \\equiv \\Omega_R$, the generalized Rabi frequency.\nThe evolution operator is $U_{RWA}(t) = \\exp(-i \\tilde{H}_{RWA} t / \\hbar) = \\cos(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2})I - i \\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2})\\frac{\\tilde{H}_{RWA}}{\\hbar\\Omega_R/2}$.\n$$ U_{RWA}(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2}\\right)I - \\frac{i}{\\Omega_R}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\Delta & -\\Omega e^{i\\phi} \\\\ -\\Omega e^{-i\\phi} & \\Delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nApplying this to the initial state $\\lvert g \\rangle$:\n$$ \\lvert \\tilde{\\psi}(T)\\rangle = U_{RWA}(T) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{i\\Omega e^{i\\phi}}{\\Omega_R} \\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2}) \\\\ \\cos(\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2}) - \\frac{i\\Delta}{\\Omega_R} \\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe excited-state population $P_e(T)$ is the squared magnitude of the coefficient of $\\lvert e \\rangle$. The populations are invariant under the transformation to the rotating frame.\n$$ P_e(T) = |\\tilde{c}_e(T)|^2 = \\left| \\frac{i\\Omega e^{i\\phi}}{\\Omega_R} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2}\\right) \\right|^2 = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Omega_R^2} |e^{i\\phi}|^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2}\\right) $$\nAs $|e^{i\\phi}|=1$, the population is independent of the phase $\\phi$. Substituting $\\Omega_R = \\sqrt{\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2}$, we obtain the final expression for the first part:\n$$ P_e(T) = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Omega^2 + \\Delta^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2} T}{2}\\right) $$\nThis expression is a function of $\\Omega$, $\\Delta$, and $T$, but not $\\phi$.\n\nNow, we perform the maximization as requested in the second part. We want to maximize $P_e(T)$ over $T \\ge 0$, $\\phi$, and $\\Omega \\in [0, \\Omega_{\\max}]$, for a fixed $\\Delta \\neq 0$.\nMaximization over $\\phi$: As $P_e(T)$ is independent of $\\phi$, any value of $\\phi$ is optimal.\nMaximization over $T \\ge 0$: For fixed $\\Omega$ and $\\Delta$, we must maximize the term $\\sin^2(\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2})$. The maximum value is $1$, achieved when the argument is an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$. The shortest time $T > 0$ to achieve this is when $\\frac{\\Omega_R T}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which gives $T = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega_R} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2}}$. At this optimal time, the population becomes\n$$ P_e^{\\max,T}(\\Omega) = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Omega^2 + \\Delta^2} $$\nMaximization over $\\Omega \\in [0, \\Omega_{\\max}]$: We must now maximize the function $f(\\Omega) = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Omega^2 + \\Delta^2}$ on the interval $[0, \\Omega_{\\max}]$. The derivative is $f'(\\Omega) = \\frac{2\\Omega\\Delta^2}{(\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2)^2}$. For $\\Omega \\ge 0$ and a fixed $\\Delta \\neq 0$, $f'(\\Omega) \\ge 0$. This indicates that $f(\\Omega)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\Omega$. Therefore, its maximum on the closed interval $[0, \\Omega_{\\max}]$ is achieved at the boundary point $\\Omega = \\Omega_{\\max}$.\nThe best achievable population under all constraints is\n$$ P_e^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Omega_{\\max}^2}{\\Omega_{\\max}^2 + \\Delta^2} $$\nThis result represents a constrained maximum. The unconstrained global optimum for population transfer is $P_e=1$. This is achievable with resonant driving ($\\Delta=0$), where $P_e^{\\max,T}(\\Omega) = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\Omega^2} = 1$ for any $\\Omega > 0$. The problem, however, fixes the control field frequency $\\omega_c$ to be off-resonance, resulting in a fixed, non-zero detuning $\\Delta$.\nThe set of available controls is restricted to monochromatic fields of a specific frequency $\\omega_c$ and a bounded amplitude. The optimization procedure correctly finds the maximum population achievable *within this restricted set*. The resulting value $P_e^{\\star} < 1$ is a stationary point (a maximum) for the given control problem. It is considered a \"false trap\" because it is an optimal solution under artificially restrictive constraints, not the true global optimum that a more flexible control strategy (e.g., a frequency-chirped pulse or a more complex amplitude modulation) could achieve. The constraints on the form of the control function itself prevent the system from reaching the ideal target state $\\lvert e \\rangle$ with probability $1$.\n\nFor the third part, we compute the numerical value. We are given:\n$\\Delta = 2\\pi \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 2\\pi \\times 3 \\times 10^9 \\text{ rad/s}$.\n$\\Omega_{\\max} = 2\\pi \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{GHz} = 2\\pi \\times 1 \\times 10^9 \\text{ rad/s}$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $P_e^{\\star}$:\n$$ P_e^{\\star} = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 1 \\times 10^9)^2}{(2\\pi \\times 1 \\times 10^9)^2 + (2\\pi \\times 3 \\times 10^9)^2} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^9)^2}{(1 \\times 10^9)^2 + (3 \\times 10^9)^2} $$\n$$ P_e^{\\star} = \\frac{1^2}{1^2 + 3^2} = \\frac{1}{1+9} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
