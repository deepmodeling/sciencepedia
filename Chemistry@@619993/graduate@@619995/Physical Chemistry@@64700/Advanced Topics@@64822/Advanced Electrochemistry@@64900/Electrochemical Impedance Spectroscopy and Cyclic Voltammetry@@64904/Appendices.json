It is a standard problem in the analysis of linear, time-invariant circuits and its application to electrochemical systems. The given information is complete and consistent. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet the imaginary unit be denoted by $i$, where $i^2 = -1$.\nA sinusoidal current $i(t)$ with angular frequency $\\omega$ and real amplitude $I_0$ can be represented as the real part of a complex exponential function: $i(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\tilde{I}(t)\\}$, where $\\tilde{I}(t) = I_0 \\exp(i \\omega t)$. The complex quantity $\\tilde{I}(t)$ is used for analysis, and its complex amplitude, $\\tilde{I} = I_0$, is the current phasor.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the time-domain constitutive relations for a resistor and a capacitor.\n\nFor a resistor with resistance $R$, the time-domain voltage-current relationship is $v_R(t) = R \\cdot i(t)$. The corresponding complex voltage is $\\tilde{V}_R(t) = R \\cdot \\tilde{I}(t) = R I_0 \\exp(i \\omega t)$. The voltage phasor across the resistor is $\\tilde{V}_R = R I_0$.\n\nFor a capacitor with capacitance $C$, the time-domain relationship is $i(t) = C \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$. Therefore, the rate of change of the complex voltage is $\\frac{d\\tilde{V}_C(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C}\\tilde{I}(t) = \\frac{I_0}{C}\\exp(i \\omega t)$. Integrating with respect to time $t$ to find the complex voltage gives $\\tilde{V}_C(t) = \\int \\frac{I_0}{C}\\exp(i \\omega t) dt = \\frac{I_0}{i \\omega C}\\exp(i \\omega t)$. The integration constant corresponds to a DC offset, which is zero in steady-state AC analysis. The voltage phasor across the capacitor is $\\tilde{V}_C = \\frac{I_0}{i \\omega C}$.\n\nThe total impedance $Z(\\omega)$ of a circuit element is defined as the ratio of its voltage phasor to the current phasor, $Z(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{V}}{\\tilde{I}}$.\nThe impedance of the resistor is $Z_R = \\frac{\\tilde{V}_R}{\\tilde{I}} = \\frac{R I_0}{I_0} = R$.\nThe impedance of the capacitor is $Z_C = \\frac{\\tilde{V}_C}{\\tilde{I}} = \\frac{I_0 / (i \\omega C)}{I_0} = \\frac{1}{i \\omega C}$.\n\nFor components connected in series, the total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages. Thus, the total voltage phasor is the sum of the individual voltage phasors: $\\tilde{V}_{total} = \\tilde{V}_R + \\tilde{V}_C$. The total impedance of the series circuit is the sum of the individual impedances:\n$$Z(\\omega) = Z_R + Z_C = R + \\frac{1}{i \\omega C}$$\nTo separate this into real and imaginary parts, we use the identity $1/i = -i$:\n$$Z(\\omega) = R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C}$$\nThe real part of the impedance is $\\text{Re}\\{Z(\\omega)\\} = R$, and the imaginary part is $\\text{Im}\\{Z(\\omega)\\} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}$.\n\nNow we proceed to derive the required quantities.\n\n1.  The magnitude of the complex impedance, $|Z(\\omega)|$, is the modulus of the complex number $Z(\\omega)$. For a complex number $z = x + iy$, its magnitude is $|z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.\n    $$|Z(\\omega)| = \\sqrt{(\\text{Re}\\{Z(\\omega)\\})^2 + (\\text{Im}\\{Z(\\omega)\\})^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)^2}$$\n    Since $R>0$, $C>0$, and $\\omega>0$, the magnitude is:\n    $$|Z(\\omega)| = \\sqrt{R^2 + \\frac{1}{(\\omega C)^2}}$$\n\n2.  The phase angle of the complex impedance, $\\varphi(\\omega)$, is the argument of the complex number $Z(\\omega)$. For $z = x + iy$, the phase angle is $\\varphi = \\arctan(y/x)$, with attention to the quadrant. Here, the real part $R$ is positive and the imaginary part $-1/(\\omega C)$ is negative, so the impedance lies in the fourth quadrant. The standard `arctan` function gives a result in $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, which is appropriate for this case.\n    $$\\varphi(\\omega) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\text{Im}\\{Z(\\omega)\\}}{\\text{Re}\\{Z(\\omega)\\}}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1/(\\omega C)}{R}\\right)$$\n    $$\\varphi(\\omega) = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\omega RC}\\right)$$\n    Using the property $\\arctan(-x) = -\\arctan(x)$:\n    $$\\varphi(\\omega) = -\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega RC}\\right)$$\n\n3.  The angular frequency $\\omega_{45}$ at which the phase angle equals $-\\pi/4$ radians is found by setting $\\varphi(\\omega_{45}) = -\\pi/4$:\n    $$-\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{45} RC}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n    Multiplying by $-1$ gives:\n    $$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{45} RC}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n    Taking the tangent of both sides of the equation yields:\n    $$\\tan\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_{45} RC}\\right)\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$$\n    $$\\frac{1}{\\omega_{45} RC} = 1$$\n    Solving for $\\omega_{45}$:\n    $$\\omega_{45} = \\frac{1}{RC}$$\nThe product $RC$ is the characteristic time constant of the circuit, and its reciprocal is indeed a characteristic frequency.

A cyclic voltammetry (CV; cyclic voltammetry) experiment is performed with a linear potential sweep at scan rate $v$, and the instrument records the control potential $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t)$ between the reference and working electrode leads. Because the reference lead is separated from the working electrode surface by an ohmic path, there is an uncompensated solution resistance $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$, so that the true interfacial potential at the working electrode is $E_{\\mathrm{WE}}(t) = E_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t) - i(t)\\,R_{\\mathrm{u}}$, where $i(t)$ is the instantaneous cell current.

The true potential at the working electrode interface, $E_{\\mathrm{WE}}$, differs from the potential measured by the instrument, $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, due to the ohmic potential drop across the solution resistance between the reference electrode tip and the working electrode surface. This relationship is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{WE}}(t) = E_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t) - i(t)\\,R_{\\mathrm{u}}$$\nThe current, $i(t)$, that causes this drop is the **total** current flowing through the cell. Both the faradaic current, $i_{\\mathrm{F}}(t)$, and the non-faradaic double-layer charging current, $i_{\\mathrm{C}}(t)$, must traverse this resistance. Therefore, $i(t) = i_{\\mathrm{F}}(t) + i_{\\mathrm{C}}(t)$. The problem provides the measured total peak currents, $i_{p,a}$ and $i_{p,c}$.

The correction formula, $E_{p}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{p}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - i_{\\mathrm{tot}} R_{\\mathrm{u}}$, is the correct strategy, as it uses the total current.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: The option's final calculated value for the formal potential, $E^{0'} \\approx 0.259\\,\\mathrm{V}$, matches our derived value. However, the intermediate values for the corrected peak potentials ($0.290\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $0.228\\,\\mathrm{V}$) are incorrect. Our correct calculations yield $0.296\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $0.222\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The error in the option's intermediate calculation appears to arise from an incorrect manipulation of currents, specifically by taking the measured total current and adding the capacitive current again before calculating the ohmic drop. This is a physical absurdity. Nevertheless, this error is constructed such that it cancels out perfectly when the potentials are averaged.\n- **Verdict**: Despite the flawed numerical demonstration for the intermediate steps, this option presents the only fundamentally correct physical principle and the correct overall strategy. The core of the statement is sound, and the final answer is correct. Thus, it is the best available option. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The uncompensated resistance only drops faradaic current because capacitive current does not traverse the solution resistance; therefore, use $E_{p}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = E_{p}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - i_{\\mathrm{F}} R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and ignore $i_{\\mathrm{C}}$ in the correction. This yields $E^{0'} \\approx 0.259\\,\\mathrm{V}$.**\n\n- **Principle**: The premise \"capacitive current does not traverse the solution resistance\" is fundamentally false. The charging of the double layer requires charge to flow from the external circuit through the electrolyte, and thus through $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$. The proposed strategy of using only the faradaic current for correction is therefore incorrect.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: First, we must find the faradaic current components. The capacitive current is $i_{\\mathrm{C}} = C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\,v = (1.50 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{F})(0.10\\,\\mathrm{V\\,s^{-1}}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$. So, $i_{\\mathrm{C,a}} = +15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ and $i_{\\mathrm{C,c}} = -15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$. The faradaic currents at the total current peaks are $i_{p,a,\\mathrm{F}} = i_{p,a} - i_{\\mathrm{C,a}} = 160\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} - 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 145\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ and $i_{p,c,\\mathrm{F}} = i_{p,c} - i_{\\mathrm{C,c}} = -155\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} - (-15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}) = -140\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$. Using these in the flawed strategy: $E_{p,a}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = 0.360 - (145\\times 10^{-6})(400) = 0.302\\,\\mathrm{V}$; $E_{p,c}^{\\mathrm{corr}} = 0.160 - (-140\\times 10^{-6})(400) = 0.216\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Averaging these gives $E^{0'} = (0.302+0.216)/2 = 0.259\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The result for $E^{0'}$ is coincidentally correct because the error introduced by omitting the symmetric capacitive currents from the ohmic drop calculation cancels upon averaging. However, a correct result from a fallacious method is not a correct answer.\n- **Verdict**: The underlying physical principle is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The apparent shift in $E_{p}$ is dominated by capacitive background; subtract a background CV to remove $i_{\\mathrm{C}}$ from the current axis and compute the midpoint of the measured peaks without any potential-axis correction. This yields $E^{0'} \\approx (0.360\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.160\\,\\mathrm{V})/2 \\approx 0.260\\,\\mathrm{V}$.**\n\n- **Principle**: This option proposes to ignore the ohmic drop correction entirely. With $R_{\\mathrm{u}}=400\\,\\Omega$ and currents over $150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}$, the ohmic drop is substantial (over $60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and cannot be ignored. The statement that the shift is \"dominated\" by capacitive background is misleading; the IR drop is the primary source of potential shift.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: The proposed calculation is simply the midpoint of the uncorrected, measured peak potentials: $(0.360\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.160\\,\\mathrm{V})/2 = 0.260\\,\\mathrm{V}$. This value is close to the correct answer only because the magnitudes of the anodic and cathodic peak currents are coincidentally close, making the ohmic drops nearly symmetric. However, they are not identical, and this method is fundamentally flawed.\n- **Verdict**: The strategy is physically unsound as it neglects a major, known systematic error. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Positive-feedback compensation of $R_{\\mathrm{u}}$ at $100\\%$ (using the EIS value) during CV eliminates both ohmic and capacitive distortions of $E_{p}$ across scan rates, so one may take $E^{0'}$ as the uncorrected midpoint $0.260\\,\\mathrm{V}$ in all cases without further analysis.**\n\n- **Principle**: This option discusses an experimental procedure (positive-feedback IR compensation) that was not part of the experiment described in the problem. The problem is one of data analysis for an uncompensated measurement. The suggestion to use the uncorrected midpoint is therefore irrelevant and inappropriate for the given data set. Furthermore, even perfect feedback does not \"eliminate\" capacitive distortions, although it mitigates some of their effects on the potential waveform.\n- **Quantitative Analysis**: The option advocates for the same incorrect calculation as in C, taking the uncorrected midpoint.\n- **Verdict**: This option is irrelevant to the problem posed, which is about analyzing existing data, not about hypothetical alternative experiments. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}]}
