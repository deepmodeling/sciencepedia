All aspects of the problem are grounded in standard semiconductor physics and are well-defined. The problem is thus deemed valid.\n\nThe relationship connecting the diffusion coefficient $D$ and mobility $\\mu$ of a charged carrier is derived under the condition of thermal equilibrium. At equilibrium, there is no net flow of charge carriers, meaning the total current density for any given species is zero. The one-dimensional flux density $J$ for a charged species with concentration $c$ and charge $z q$ (where $z$ is the charge number, $+1$ for holes, $-1$ for electrons) is given by the Nernst–Planck equation, which combines drift and diffusion components:\n$$J = J_{\\text{drift}} + J_{\\text{diff}}$$\nThe drift flux density is driven by the electric field $E$ and is given by $J_{\\text{drift}} = c(zq)\\mu E$. The diffusion flux density is driven by the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ and is given by Fick's first law, $J_{\\text{diff}} = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$.\nThus, the total flux density is:\n$$J = c(zq)\\mu E - D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nAt thermal equilibrium, the net flux is zero, $J=0$. Therefore:\n$$c(zq)\\mu E = D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nThe electric field $E$ is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential $\\phi$, so $E = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$. Substituting this into the zero-flux condition gives:\n$$-c(zq)\\mu \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nFurthermore, at thermal equilibrium in a non-degenerate semiconductor, the concentration of charge carriers is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The potential energy of a carrier is $U = (zq)\\phi$. The concentration $c$ is related to the potential $\\phi$ by:\n$$c(x) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(x)}{k_B T}\\right) = c_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{zq\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $c_0$ is a constant. We now compute the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ by applying the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{dc}{d\\phi}\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\left[ c_0 \\left(-\\frac{zq}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{zq\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\right] \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -\\frac{zq}{k_B T} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$$\nSubstituting this expression for the concentration gradient back into the zero-flux equation yields:\n$$-c(zq)\\mu \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = D \\left(-\\frac{zq}{k_B T} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)$$\nAssuming a non-trivial case where $c \\neq 0$, $q \\neq 0$, and $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} \\neq 0$, we can cancel the common terms $-c(zq)\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ from both sides of the equation. This leaves:\n$$\\mu = D \\frac{|z|q}{k_B T}$$\nNote that mobility $\\mu$ and diffusion coefficient $D$ are defined as positive quantities. For holes ($z=+1$) and electrons ($z=-1$), the charge is $q$ and $-q$ respectively. The derivation holds for both, with the final relation expressed in terms of the magnitude of the elementary charge, $q$. Rearranging for $D$ gives the Einstein relation:\n$$D = \\frac{\\mu k_B T}{q}$$\nThis relationship is general for any charge carrier in a dilute system at thermal equilibrium.\n\nNext, we use this derived relationship to compute the diffusion coefficients for electrons ($D_n$) and holes ($D_p$). The term $\\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage, $V_T$.

This asymmetry means that electrons are far more mobile and diffuse much faster than holes ($D_n \\gg D_p$).\nFor a **photoanode** (typically an n-type semiconductor), photogenerated holes are the minority carriers that must travel to the semiconductor-electrolyte interface to drive an oxidation reaction. The performance is limited by the transport of these slow holes. The hole diffusion length, $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$ (where $\\tau_p$ is minority carrier lifetime), is short due to the small value of $D_p$. To collect holes efficiently, they must be generated within or very near the space-charge region, where the strong electric field can assist their transport via drift. Holes generated deep in the bulk (at a distance greater than $L_p$ from the depletion region edge) are likely to recombine before being collected. Thus, an optimal photoanode made from this material must be very thin, on the order of the absorption depth or the sum of the depletion width $W$ and the short hole diffusion length $L_p$, whichever is more restrictive, to ensure that most holes are generated where they can be collected. This constraint can compromise light absorption.\nFor a **photocathode** (typically a p-type semiconductor), photogenerated electrons are the minority carriers that must travel to the surface to drive a reduction reaction. The performance is limited by electron transport. Due to the high electron mobility $\\mu_n$, the electron diffusion coefficient $D_n$ is large, leading to a long electron diffusion length, $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$. These fast-moving electrons can travel long distances before recombining. Therefore, electrons generated deep within the semiconductor bulk can still diffuse efficiently to the space-charge region and be swept to the surface reactive sites. This allows for the use of a thicker absorber layer, which enhances the absorption of incident photons and improves the overall quantum efficiency, especially for weakly absorbed, near-bandgap light.\nIn conclusion, the pronounced transport asymmetry ($\\mu_n \\gg \\mu_p$) makes this material intrinsically far better suited for application as a photocathode, where the highly mobile electrons are the minority carriers. Designing an efficient photoanode from this material would be a significant challenge, requiring careful nanostructuring or heterojunction engineering to overcome the severe limitation imposed by poor hole transport.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50.0}$$", "id": "2667402"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of carrier transport, we now turn our attention to the critical region where charge separation occurs: the semiconductor-electrolyte interface.
