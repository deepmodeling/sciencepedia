A primary application is identifying the rate-determining step (RDS) by observing whether the reaction rate is sensitive to isotopic substitution at a specific bond. This first exercise guides you through the critical logic of interpreting an experimental KIE value that is close to unity, a common and highly informative outcome in studies of multi-step reactions.

To probe the reaction mechanism, the kinetic properties of the reaction are studied using both normal ethanol and an isotopically labeled version, ethanol-1,1-d2 ($CH_3CD_2OH$), where both hydrogens on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group are replaced with deuterium.\n\nA simplified multi-step mechanism is proposed for the enzymatic reaction:\nStep 1: The ethanol substrate binds to the enzyme's active site.\nStep 2: An intramolecular hydrogen transfer occurs, breaking one of the C-H (or C-D) bonds at the C1 position.\nStep 3: The acetaldehyde product is released from the enzyme.\n\nThe overall rate of product formation is measured for both substrates under identical conditions. The experiment reveals that the rate constant for the reaction with normal ethanol, $k_H$, is virtually identical to the rate constant for the reaction with deuterated ethanol, $k_D$. The observed Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE), defined as the ratio $k_H/k_D$, is determined to be 1.02.\n\nBased solely on this KIE value, which of the following conclusions can be drawn about the rate-determining step (RDS) of the overall enzymatic reaction?\n\nA.

Product release (no C1 X-H bond cleavage).\n\nThe experimentally observed kinetic isotope effect is defined as\n$$\n\\text{KIE}=\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}}=1.02.\n$$\nUnder transition state theory, a rate constant for a given isotopologue can be written as\n$$\nk=\\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}}{Q}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nso the primary KIE for a step in which an X-H bond is broken in the rate-determining transition state takes the form\n$$\n\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}}=\\frac{\\left(Q^{\\ddagger}_{H}/Q_{H}\\right)}{\\left(Q^{\\ddagger}_{D}/Q_{D}\\right)}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{H}-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{D}}{RT}\\right).\n$$\nWhen the isotopically sensitive C-H or C-D bond is significantly weakened or broken in the rate-determining transition state (a primary isotope effect), the zero-point energy difference between C-H and C-D typically lowers the effective barrier for H relative to D, yielding a KIE appreciably greater than unity. Conversely, when the rate-determining step does not involve cleavage of the labeled C-H or C-D bond, only small secondary or equilibrium isotope effects are expected, so the observed KIE remains close to unity.\n\nIn the present system, Step 2 explicitly involves breaking a C-H or C-D bond at C1 and therefore would produce a primary isotope effect if it were the rate-determining step, leading to $k_{H}/k_{D}$ appreciably greater than 1. The observed value $k_{H}/k_{D}=1.02$ is essentially unity, indicating no substantial primary isotope effect. Thus, Step 2 is unlikely to be the rate-determining step.\n\nSteps 1 and 3 do not involve cleavage of the labeled C-H or C-D bond in their transition states; therefore, if either binding (Step 1) or product release (Step 3) were rate-determining, a KIE near unity would be expected. Based solely on the KIE value, one cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the data support that either Step 1 or Step 3 could be the rate-determining step, but not Step 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1520161"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a KIE near unity can exclude a step from being rate-determining, we now explore the quantitative origin of a significant primary KIE.
