First, the calculation of the ionic strength of a given electrolyte solution. Second, an assessment of the applicability of the Debye–Hückel limiting law (DHLL) for predicting kinetic salt effects in this solution, supported by a fundamental explanation of the primary kinetic salt effect.\n\nThe ionic strength, $I$, of a solution is a measure of the total concentration of ions. It is defined by the formula:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_i z_i^2$$\nwhere $c_i$ is the molar concentration of ion $i$ and $z_i$ is its charge number. The summation is over all types of ions present in the solution.\n\nThe solution is prepared by dissolving three salts in water: sodium chloride ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$) at a concentration of $0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, potassium nitrate ($\\mathrm{KNO}_3$) at $0.05\\,\\mathrm{M}$, and magnesium sulfate ($\\mathrm{MgSO}_4$) at $0.02\\,\\mathrm{M}$. We assume complete dissociation of these strong electrolytes.\n\nThe dissociation reactions and resulting ion concentrations are:\n1.  $\\mathrm{NaCl}(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}(aq) + \\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(aq)$\n    - $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = +1$\n    - $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = -1$\n2.  $\\mathrm{KNO}_3(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{K}^{+}(aq) + \\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}(aq)$\n    - $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}] = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} = +1$\n    - $[\\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}] = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}} = -1$\n3.  $\\mathrm{MgSO}_4(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + \\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)$\n    - $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = +2$\n    - $[\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}] = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{M}$, with charge $z_{\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}} = -2$\n\nNow, we substitute these concentrations and charges into the definition of ionic strength:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}](+1)^2 + [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}](-1)^2 + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}](+1)^2 + [\\mathrm{NO}_3^{-}](-1)^2 + [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}](+2)^2 + [\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}](-2)^2 \\right)$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (0.10)(1) + (0.10)(1) + (0.05)(1) + (0.05)(1) + (0.02)(4) + (0.02)(4) \\right)\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} (0.10 + 0.10 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.08 + 0.08)\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} (0.46)\\,\\mathrm{M} = 0.23\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe calculated ionic strength of the solution is $0.23\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nNext, we assess whether it is scientifically appropriate to apply the Debye–Hückel limiting law (DHLL) at this ionic strength. The DHLL is a theoretical model that provides an expression for the activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ of an ion in a very dilute solution:\n$$\\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant dependent on the solvent and temperature (for water at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $A \\approx 0.509\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1/2}$). The derivation of the DHLL relies on several key approximations, including treating ions as point charges and using a linearization of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which is valid only when the electrostatic potential energy of interaction between ions is much smaller than the thermal energy, $k_B T$. These approximations restrict the DHLL's validity to a regime of very low ionic strength, typically $I \\lesssim 0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nOur calculated ionic strength is $I = 0.23\\,\\mathrm{M}$. This value is substantially greater than the upper limit of the DHLL's range of validity ($0.23\\,\\mathrm{M} \\gg 0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}$). At such a concentration, the assumptions underlying the DHLL are no longer valid. The finite size of ions becomes significant, and ion-ion interactions are too strong for the linearization to hold. Furthermore, ion pairing, especially between divalent ions like $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$, becomes prevalent, which contradicts the assumption of complete dissociation and further invalidates the model. Therefore, it is scientifically inappropriate to apply the Debye–Hückel limiting law to this solution. More advanced models, such as the extended Debye-Hückel equation or the Davies equation, would be required for a semi-quantitative estimation at this ionic strength.\n\nFinally, we explain the primary kinetic salt effect. This effect describes the influence of the ionic strength of an inert electrolyte on the rate constant of a reaction between charged species. According to transition state theory (TST), for a bimolecular reaction $A + B \\rightarrow \\text{Products}$, the reactants are in equilibrium with an activated complex $(AB)^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$A^{z_A} + B^{z_B} \\rightleftharpoons (AB)^{\\ddagger, z_A+z_B}$$\nThe rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of the activated complex. The rate constant, $k$, is related to the rate constant at infinite dilution, $k_0$, and the activity coefficients of the reactants ($\\gamma_A$, $\\gamma_B$) and the activated complex ($\\gamma_{\\ddagger}$):\n$$k = k_0 \\frac{\\gamma_A \\gamma_B}{\\gamma_{\\ddagger}}$$\nTaking the base-10 logarithm gives:\n$$\\log_{10}(k) = \\log_{10}(k_0) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_A) + \\log_{10}(\\gamma_B) - \\log_{10}(\\gamma_{\\ddagger})$$\nUsing the DHLL expression $\\log_{10}(\\gamma_i) = -A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}$ for each species (even though it is not valid for the present case, it illustrates the leading-order behavior):\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = -A z_A^2 \\sqrt{I} - A z_B^2 \\sqrt{I} - (-A z_{\\ddagger}^2 \\sqrt{I})$$\nSince charge is conserved upon formation of the activated complex, $z_{\\ddagger} = z_A + z_B$. Substituting this in:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = -A\\sqrt{I} \\left( z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z_A+z_B)^2 \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = -A\\sqrt{I} \\left( z_A^2 + z_B^2 - (z_A^2 + 2z_A z_B + z_B^2) \\right)$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right) = 2 A z_A z_B \\sqrt{I}$$\nThis is the Brønsted-Bjerrum equation. It predicts that the logarithm of the rate constant changes linearly with the square root of the ionic strength. The sign of the effect depends on the product of the reactant charges, $z_A z_B$.\n- If $z_A z_B > 0$ (reactants have like charges), an increase in ionic strength increases the rate constant ($k > k_0$). The inert electrolyte ions form an ionic atmosphere that screens the electrostatic repulsion between the reactants, lowering the activation energy.\n- If $z_A z_B < 0$ (reactants have opposite charges), an increase in ionic strength decreases the rate constant ($k < k_0$). The ionic atmosphere screens the electrostatic attraction between reactants, making their encounter less favorable and increasing the activation energy.\n- If $z_A z_B = 0$ (one reactant is neutral), the DHLL predicts no primary kinetic salt effect to a first approximation.\n\nWhile the DHLL is quantitatively incorrect for the solution in question, this relationship correctly describes the qualitative trend and the leading-order dependence on $z_A z_B$ for the primary kinetic salt effect at low concentrations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.230}$$", "id": "2665664"}, {"introduction": "Moving from foundational concepts to quantitative prediction, this practice explores the Brønsted-Bjerrum equation in the limiting law regime.
