We will use the flux-over-population method in the quasi-stationary state.\n\nThe starting point is the one-dimensional Smoluchowski equation, which describes the evolution of the probability density $P(x,t)$ for a particle undergoing overdamped motion in a potential $U(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J(x,t)}{\\partial x} $$\nThe probability current $J(x,t)$ is given by:\n$$ J(x,t) = -\\frac{1}{\\zeta} \\left( \\frac{dU(x)}{dx} P(x,t) + k_B T \\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the friction coefficient, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. This expression for the current can be written more compactly by introducing the diffusion coefficient $D = k_B T / \\zeta$:\n$$ J(x,t) = -D e^{-U(x)/k_B T} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( P(x,t) e^{U(x)/k_B T} \\right) $$\n\nWe assume a quasi-stationary state, where the probability distribution changes very slowly, such that $\\frac{\\partial P(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\approx 0$ for the region between the reactant well and the barrier top. In this limit, the flux becomes independent of position, i.e., $J(x,t) \\approx j$, where $j$ is a constant. The equation for the stationary flux $j$ is:\n$$ j = -D e^{-U(x)/k_B T} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( P_{ss}(x) e^{U(x)/k_B T} \\right) $$\nwhere $P_{ss}(x)$ is the quasi-stationary probability distribution.\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{j}{D} e^{U(x)/k_B T} = - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( P_{ss}(x) e^{U(x)/k_B T} \\right) $$\nWe can integrate this equation from a point $A$ deep in the reactant well to a point $B$ far on the product side of the barrier:\n$$ \\frac{j}{D} \\int_{A}^{B} e^{U(x)/k_B T} dx = - \\left[ P_{ss}(x) e^{U(x)/k_B T} \\right]_{A}^{B} = P_{ss}(A)e^{U(A)/k_B T} - P_{ss}(B)e^{U(B)/k_B T} $$\nThe problem specifies an absorbing boundary on the product side, which implies that any particle reaching this region is removed from the system.

Substituting this ansatz into the equation, we get:\n$$ m \\lambda^2 \\exp(\\lambda t) + \\int_{0}^{t} \\eta(t-t') \\lambda \\exp(\\lambda t') \\,\\mathrm{d} t' - m \\omega_{b}^{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) = 0 $$\nDividing by $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ and evaluating the convolution integral in the long-time limit (which is equivalent to a Laplace transform), we have:\n$$ m \\lambda^2 + \\lambda \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\eta(\\tau) \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) \\,\\mathrm{d} \\tau - m \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nThe integral is the Laplace transform of the memory kernel, $\\tilde{\\eta}(\\lambda) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\eta(t)\\}(\\lambda)$. The characteristic equation for $\\lambda$ is therefore:\n$$ m \\lambda^2 + \\lambda \\tilde{\\eta}(\\lambda) - m \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nThe reactive frequency $\\lambda_r$ is the unique positive real root of this equation.\n\nThe problem specifies a Debye friction kernel: $\\eta(t) = \\gamma \\,\\omega_{c} \\,\\exp(-\\omega_{c} t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. Its Laplace transform is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\eta}(\\lambda) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\gamma \\omega_{c} \\exp(-\\omega_{c} t) \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\,\\mathrm{d} t = \\gamma \\omega_{c} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(\\lambda + \\omega_{c}) t) \\,\\mathrm{d} t = \\frac{\\gamma \\omega_{c}}{\\lambda + \\omega_{c}} $$\nSubstituting this into the characteristic equation gives:\n$$ m \\lambda^2 + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\gamma \\omega_{c}}{\\lambda + \\omega_{c}} \\right) - m \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nNow, we must use the special condition given for the friction amplitude $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{2 m}{\\omega_{c}} \\left(\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}^{2}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that this is physically admissible and positive for $\\omega_{b} > \\omega_{c}$. Substituting this expression for $\\gamma$ into the characteristic equation:\n$$ m \\lambda^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + \\omega_{c}} \\left( \\left( \\frac{2 m}{\\omega_{c}} (\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}^{2}) \\right) \\omega_{c} \\right) - m \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\n$$ m \\lambda^2 + \\frac{2 m \\lambda (\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}^{2})}{\\lambda + \\omega_{c}} - m \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nSince mass $m$ is non-zero, we can divide the entire equation by $m$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 + \\frac{2 \\lambda (\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}^{2})}{\\lambda + \\omega_{c}} - \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we clear the denominator by multiplying by $(\\lambda + \\omega_{c})$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 (\\lambda + \\omega_{c}) + 2 \\lambda (\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}^{2}) - \\omega_{b}^{2} (\\lambda + \\omega_{c}) = 0 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ \\lambda^3 + \\omega_{c}\\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda\\omega_{b}^{2} - 2\\lambda\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\lambda\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nCombining like terms, we obtain a cubic polynomial in $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda^3 + \\omega_{c}\\lambda^2 + (\\omega_{b}^{2} - 2\\omega_{c}^{2})\\lambda - \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2} = 0 $$\nWe search for the positive real root of this cubic equation. Let us test if $\\lambda = \\omega_{c}$ is a root:\n$$ (\\omega_{c})^3 + \\omega_{c}(\\omega_{c})^2 + (\\omega_{b}^{2} - 2\\omega_{c}^{2})\\omega_{c} - \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2} = \\omega_{c}^3 + \\omega_{c}^3 + \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2} - 2\\omega_{c}^3 - \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2} = (2\\omega_{c}^3 - 2\\omega_{c}^3) + (\\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2}) = 0 $$\nIndeed, $\\lambda = \\omega_{c}$ is a root. This implies that $(\\lambda - \\omega_{c})$ is a factor of the polynomial. We can perform polynomial division to find the other factors:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda^3 + \\omega_{c}\\lambda^2 + (\\omega_{b}^{2} - 2\\omega_{c}^{2})\\lambda - \\omega_{c}\\omega_{b}^{2}}{\\lambda - \\omega_{c}} = \\lambda^2 + 2\\omega_{c}\\lambda + \\omega_{b}^{2} $$\nThus, the characteristic equation can be written in factored form:\n$$ (\\lambda - \\omega_{c})(\\lambda^2 + 2\\omega_{c}\\lambda + \\omega_{b}^{2}) = 0 $$\nThe roots are $\\lambda_1 = \\omega_{c}$ and the roots of the quadratic equation $\\lambda^2 + 2\\omega_{c}\\lambda + \\omega_{b}^{2} = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, the other two roots are:\n$$ \\lambda_{2,3} = \\frac{-2\\omega_{c} \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\omega_{c})^2 - 4(1)(\\omega_{b}^{2})}}{2} = -\\omega_{c} \\pm \\sqrt{\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\omega_{b}^{2}} $$\nThe problem is constrained by the condition $\\omega_{b} > \\omega_{c} > 0$. This implies that $\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\omega_{b}^{2}  0$. Therefore, the roots $\\lambda_{2,3}$ are a pair of complex conjugates with a negative real part:\n$$ \\lambda_{2,3} = -\\omega_{c} \\pm i\\sqrt{\\omega_{b}^{2} - \\omega_{c}^{2}} $$\nThese roots correspond to stable, damped oscillatory modes. The only positive real root is $\\lambda_1 = \\omega_{c}$. This is the reactive frequency:\n$$ \\lambda_r = \\omega_{c} $$\nFinally, we compute the Grote–Hynes transmission coefficient $\\kappa$ using its definition:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\lambda_r}{\\omega_b} = \\frac{\\omega_c}{\\omega_b} $$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as required, and depends only on $\\omega_{b}$ and $\\omega_{c}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\omega_{b}}}$$", "id": "2647153"}]}
