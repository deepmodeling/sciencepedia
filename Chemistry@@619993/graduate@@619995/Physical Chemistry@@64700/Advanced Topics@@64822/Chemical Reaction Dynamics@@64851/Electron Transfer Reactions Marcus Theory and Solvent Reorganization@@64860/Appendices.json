For electron transfer, the initial state is the reactant (donor-acceptor pair, $D-A$) and the final state is the product ($D^+-A^-$). The perturbation is the electronic coupling between them, denoted by the matrix element $V$. The overall rate constant $k_{ET}$ is obtained by performing a thermal average over the manifold of initial vibronic states and summing over all final vibronic states.\n\nIn the context of Marcus theory, the complex nuclear motions of the solvent and the reactants are modeled by a single collective solvent coordinate, $q$. The free energy of the system as a function of this coordinate is described by two intersecting parabolas, representing the reactant ($R$) and product ($P$) electronic states:\n$$\nG_R(q) = \\frac{1}{2} C q^2\n$$\n$$\nG_P(q) = \\frac{1}{2} C (q - \\Delta q_0)^2 + \\Delta G^\\circ\n$$\nHere, the equilibrium configuration for the reactant state is at $q=0$, and for the product state at $q=\\Delta q_0$. $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction.
