All necessary information is provided. No contradictions or fallacies are present. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep derivation and analysis concerning a functional in the context of Density Functional Theory. We will proceed methodically through each part.\n\nFirst, we define the required derivatives. Let $F: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a functional on a normed linear space $X$.\n\nThe Gâteaux derivative of $F$ at a point $n \\in X$ in the direction of $h \\in X$ is defined as the limit:\n$$\nDF(n; h) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{F[n + \\epsilon h] - F[n]}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nprovided this limit exists. This is a directional derivative.\n\nThe Fréchet derivative of $F$ at $n \\in X$ is a bounded linear operator $A_n: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\|h\\|_{X} \\to 0} \\frac{|F[n+h] - F[n] - A_n(h)|}{\\|h\\|_{X}} = 0\n$$\nIf such an operator $A_n$ exists, it is unique and is denoted by $F'(n)$. For the Fréchet derivative to exist, the Gâteaux derivative must exist for all directions $h$ and must be a bounded linear operator in $h$, i.e., $DF(n; h) = A_n(h)$.\n\nNext, we consider the specific functional $F[n] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r})\\, n^{2}(\\mathbf{r})\\, d\\mathbf{r}$ on the space $X = L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. We compute its Gâteaux derivative.\nLet $n, h \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$ and $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We evaluate the functional at $n + \\epsilon h$:\n$$\nF[n + \\epsilon h] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) (n(\\mathbf{r}) + \\epsilon h(\\mathbf{r}))^{2} \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nExpanding the integrand:\n$$\nw(\\mathbf{r}) (n(\\mathbf{r}) + \\epsilon h(\\mathbf{r}))^{2} = w(\\mathbf{r}) \\left( n^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) + 2\\epsilon n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) + \\epsilon^{2} h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\right)\n$$\nAssuming the integrals of each term exist, we can write:\n$$\nF[n + \\epsilon h] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) n^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} + 2\\epsilon \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} + \\epsilon^{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\n$$\nF[n + \\epsilon h] = F[n] + 2\\epsilon \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} + \\epsilon^{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nNow we form the difference quotient for the Gâteaux derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{F[n + \\epsilon h] - F[n]}{\\epsilon} = 2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} + \\epsilon \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nTaking the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$\nDF(n; h) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\left( 2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} + \\epsilon \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\right) = 2 \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nThis is the Gâteaux derivative. The problem defines the functional derivative $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})}$ as the function that represents the Gâteaux derivative via the inner product on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$:\n$$\nDF(n; h) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nBy comparing this form with our result, we identify the functional derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} = 2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nNow we must determine the minimal sufficient assumptions on the weight function $w(\\mathbf{r})$.\n1. For the Gâteaux derivative to exist for all $n, h \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$, the integrals in its derivation must be finite. Specifically, $\\int w(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) h(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}$ and $\\int w(\\mathbf{r}) h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}$ must converge. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the product of two $L^{2}$ functions is in $L^{1}$. Thus $n(\\mathbf{r})h(\\mathbf{r}) \\in L^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$ and $h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\in L^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. For the integrals involving $w(\\mathbf{r})$ to converge for all choices of $n, h \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$, a sufficient and necessary condition is that $w(\\mathbf{r})$ is an essentially bounded function, i.e., $w \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. If $w \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$, then $|\\int wnh \\, d\\mathbf{r}| \\le \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\int |nh| \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\le \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\|n\\|_{2} \\|h\\|_{2}  \\infty$.\n\n2. For the Gâteaux derivative to coincide with the Fréchet derivative, we must check the limit condition. The Gâteaux derivative $DF(n; h)$ defines a linear operator in $h$, which we denote $A_n(h)$. The remainder term is $R(h) = F[n+h] - F[n] - A_n(h)$.\n$$\nR(h) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r})h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nWe must show $\\lim_{\\|h\\|_{2} \\to 0} \\frac{|R(h)|}{\\|h\\|_{2}} = 0$.\nIf we assume $w \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$, then $|w(\\mathbf{r})| \\le \\|w\\|_{\\infty}$ almost everywhere.\n$$\n|R(h)| = \\left| \\int w(\\mathbf{r}) h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\right| \\le \\int |w(\\mathbf{r})| h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\le \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\int h^{2}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} = \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\|h\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio is bounded:\n$$\n\\frac{|R(h)|}{\\|h\\|_{2}} \\le \\frac{\\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\|h\\|_{2}^{2}}{\\|h\\|_{2}} = \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\|h\\|_{2}\n$$\nAs $\\|h\\|_{2} \\to 0$, it follows that $\\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\|h\\|_{2} \\to 0$. Thus, the limit is $0$, and the Fréchet derivative exists and is equal to the Gâteaux derivative. The condition $w \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$ is sufficient.\n\n3. For the functional derivative $\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} = 2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})$ to be in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$ for any $n \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$, we require the map $n \\mapsto wn$ to be a bounded operator from $L^{2}$ to $L^{2}$. This is true if and only if $w \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. If $w \\in L^{\\infty}$, then\n$$\n\\left\\| \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta n} \\right\\|_{2}^{2} = \\int |2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})|^{2} \\, d\\mathbf{r} = 4 \\int |w(\\mathbf{r})|^{2} |n(\\mathbf{r})|^{2} \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\le 4\\|w\\|_{\\infty}^{2} \\int |n(\\mathbf{r})|^{2} \\, d\\mathbf{r} = 4\\|w\\|_{\\infty}^{2} \\|n\\|_{2}^{2}  \\infty\n$$\nThus, the single condition $w \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3})$ is sufficient for all three requirements.\n\nFinally, we articulate the Euler-Lagrange stationarity condition for minimizing the energy functional $E[n] = F[n] + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r})\\, n(\\mathbf{r})\\, d\\mathbf{r}$ subject to the constraint $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} n(\\mathbf{r})\\, d\\mathbf{r} = N$.\nThis is a constrained variational problem. We introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\\mu$ to enforce the constraint. We define an auxiliary functional $\\mathcal{L}[n]$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[n] = E[n] - \\mu \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} n(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} - N \\right)\n$$\nThe stationarity condition requires that the functional derivative of $\\mathcal{L}[n]$ with respect to $n(\\mathbf{r})$ vanishes for all $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{L}}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} = 0\n$$\nWe compute the functional derivatives of each term in $\\mathcal{L}[n]$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} = 2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}') n(\\mathbf{r}') \\, d\\mathbf{r}' = v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} \\left( -\\mu \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} n(\\mathbf{r}') \\, d\\mathbf{r}' \\right) = -\\mu\n$$\nThe derivative of the constant term $-\\mu(-N)$ is zero. Combining these results, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta E}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} - \\mu = 2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) - \\mu = 0\n$$\nOr, more commonly written as:\n$$\n2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mu\n$$\nThe Lagrange multiplier $\\mu$ is a constant determined by the condition that the resulting density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ integrates to the total number of particles $N$. In the context of quantum mechanics and DFT, $\\mu$ is identified as the chemical potential of the system. It ensures that the variation of the energy is zero only for those density variations that conserve the total particle number.\nThe question asks for the analytical expression for $\\delta F/\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})$, which we have determined to be $2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2w(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$", "id": "2634146"}, {"introduction": "One of the most frequently misinterpreted aspects of DFT is the meaning of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue gap.

We must first evaluate the energy at the endpoints $N=0$ and $N=1$.\nFor $N=0$, the density is zero, so all energy components are zero:\n$$\nE^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(0) = 0\n$$\nFor $N=1$:\n$$\nE^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(1) = K_{1}\\,(1) + U_{1}\\,(1)^{2} - \\lambda\\,U_{1}\\,(1)^{4/3} = K_{1} + U_{1} - \\lambda\\,U_{1}\n$$\nThe linear interpolation is therefore:\n$$\nL(N) = (1-N)\\,(0) + N\\,(K_{1} + U_{1} - \\lambda\\,U_{1}) = K_{1}\\,N + U_{1}\\,N - \\lambda\\,U_{1}\\,N\n$$\nThe deviation $\\delta(N)$ is found by subtracting $L(N)$ from $E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N)$:\n$$\n\\delta(N) = E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N) - L(N) = (K_{1}\\,N + U_{1}\\,N^{2} - \\lambda\\,U_{1}\\,N^{4/3}) - (K_{1}\\,N + U_{1}\\,N - \\lambda\\,U_{1}\\,N)\n$$\n$$\n\\delta(N) = U_{1}\\,N^{2} - U_{1}\\,N - \\lambda\\,U_{1}\\,N^{4/3} + \\lambda\\,U_{1}\\,N\n$$\nFactoring out $U_{1}$ gives the final analytical expression for the deviation:\n$$\n\\delta(N) = U_{1} \\left[ (N^{2} - N) - \\lambda(N^{4/3} - N) \\right]\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must evaluate $\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ using $\\lambda = 0.90$ and $U_{1} = \\frac{5}{16}$ Hartree. We substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\delta(N)$:\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{16} \\left[ \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 0.90\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4/3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{16} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 0.90\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4/3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{5}{16} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4} - 0.90\\left(2^{-4/3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n2^{-4/3} \\approx 0.39685026\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{5}{16} \\left[ -0.25 - 0.90(0.39685026 - 0.5) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{5}{16} \\left[ -0.25 - 0.90(-0.10314974) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{5}{16} \\left[ -0.25 + 0.092834766 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{5}{16} [-0.157165234] \\approx 0.3125 \\times (-0.157165234)\n$$\n$$\n\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx -0.0491141356 \\, \\text{Hartree}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we obtain $\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -0.04911$ Hartree.\n\nFor the final part, we must explain the origin of the convexity of the $E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N)$ curve for $N \\in (0,1)$. A function is convex if its curve lies at or below the straight line segment connecting its endpoints. This means $\\delta(N) = E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N) - L(N) \\leq 0$ for $N \\in [0,1]$. Our negative result for $\\delta\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ is consistent with convexity.\n\nThe linearity of the exact energy, $E(N)$, for a one-electron system arises from the perfect cancellation of the spurious self-interaction Hartree energy, $E_{H}[n_{N}]$, by the exact exchange-correlation energy, $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{exact}}[n_{N}] = -E_{H}[n_{N}]$. The non-linear terms in the approximate GGA energy are $E_{H}[n_{N}]$ and $E_{x}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_{N}]$. The source of the non-linear deviation $\\delta(N)$ is the sum of these two terms.\nThe Hartree energy scales as $E_{H}[n_{N}] = U_{1}N^{2}$. A function proportional to $N^2$ is inherently convex (its second derivative is a positive constant, $2U_1$).\nThe approximate GGA exchange energy scales as $E_{x}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_{N}] = -\\lambda U_{1}N^{4/3}$. A function proportional to $-N^{4/3}$ is concave (its second derivative is $-\\frac{4\\lambda U_1}{9}N^{-2/3}$, which is negative).\n\nThe total energy curve's curvature is determined by the competition between the convex Hartree term and the concave approximate exchange term. The total non-linear part of the energy is $E_{\\mathrm{nl}}(N) = U_{1}N^{2} - \\lambda U_{1}N^{4/3}$. The exact exchange energy would have to scale in such a way as to perfectly cancel the $N^2$ term from the Hartree energy. The GGA exchange, with its $N^{4/3}$ scaling, fails to do this. Because the exponent of the convex Hartree term ($2$) is greater than the exponent of the concave exchange term ($4/3$), the convex behavior of the Hartree self-interaction dominates the overall shape of the energy curve. This incomplete cancellation of the self-interaction in the GGA leads to a residual convex curvature, causing the total energy $E^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(N)$ to bow downwards below the straight-line interpolation. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the delocalization error inherent in many approximate density functionals.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.04911}\n$$", "id": "2634165"}]}
