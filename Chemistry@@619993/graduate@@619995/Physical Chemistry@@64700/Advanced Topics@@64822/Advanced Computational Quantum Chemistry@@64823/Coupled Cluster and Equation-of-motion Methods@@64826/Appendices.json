Use these commutation relations, the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff expansion, and the definition of the CC energy to demonstrate that the CCSD ground-state energy of the supersystem equals the sum of the monomer CCSD energies, i.e., $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(AB) = E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(A) + E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(B)$.\n\nPart II (explicit minimal model for truncated configuration interaction): Consider a minimal independent-fragment model for helium in which each monomer has one doubly occupied spatial orbital $i$ and one virtual spatial orbital $a$.

It is a standard, canonical problem in theoretical quantum chemistry used to illustrate the fundamental property of size-extensivity in electron correlation methods. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientifically unsound premises. The problem is valid, and we proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis comparing the size-extensivity of coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) and configuration interaction with singles and doubles (CISD), followed by a specific question regarding the CCSD error.\n\nPart I: Proof of CCSD Size-Extensivity\n\nWe are given two non-interacting subsystems, $A$ and $B$, described by a total Hamiltonian $H = H_A + H_B$. The Hartree-Fock reference wave function is a product of the monomer wave functions, $|\\Phi_{AB} \\rangle = |\\Phi_A \\rangle |\\Phi_B \\rangle$. The molecular orbitals of the supersystem can be partitioned into those localized on fragment $A$ and those localized on fragment $B$.\n\nThe cluster operator $T$ is a sum of excitation operators. An excitation operator creates a particle-hole pair. Since the fragments are non-interacting, the Hamiltonian $H$ does not contain any terms that couple orbitals of $A$ with orbitals of $B$. The coupled cluster amplitude equations, which determine the coefficients of the excitation operators in $T$, depend on matrix elements of the form $\\langle \\mu | \\exp(-T) H \\exp(T) | \\Phi_{AB} \\rangle$, where $|\\mu \\rangle$ is an excited determinant. If an excitation involves orbitals from both $A$ and $B$ (a so-called \"mixed\" excitation), the corresponding amplitude will be zero because there is no interaction in $H$ to generate it. Consequently, any excitation in the cluster operator $T$ for the supersystem must be localized entirely on either subsystem $A$ or subsystem $B$. The total cluster operator thus separates into a sum of monomer cluster operators:\n$$\nT = T_A + T_B\n$$\nwhere $T_A$ contains excitations involving only orbitals of $A$, and $T_B$ contains excitations involving only orbitals of $B$.\n\nGiven this separation, we establish the required commutation relations:\n1.  $[T_A, T_B] = 0$: The operators $T_A$ and $T_B$ act on disjoint sets of one-particle orbitals (fermionic creation and annihilation operators). Any two such operators commute.\n2.  $[H_A, T_B] = 0$ and $[H_B, T_A] = 0$: The Hamiltonian $H_A$ acts only on the Hilbert space of subsystem $A$, while the operator $T_B$ acts only on the Hilbert space of subsystem $B$. Operators acting on different, independent spaces commute. The same logic applies to $H_B$ and $T_A$.\n\nThe CCSD energy of the supersystem is given by $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_{AB} | \\exp(-T) H \\exp(T) | \\Phi_{AB} \\rangle$. Let us analyze the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\\bar{H} = \\exp(-T) H \\exp(T)$. Using the properties derived above:\n$$\n\\bar{H} = \\exp(-(T_A + T_B))(H_A + H_B)\\exp(T_A + T_B)\n$$\nSince $[T_A, T_B] = 0$, the exponential can be separated: $\\exp(T_A + T_B) = \\exp(T_A)\\exp(T_B)$.\n$$\n\\bar{H} = \\exp(-T_B)\\exp(-T_A)(H_A + H_B)\\exp(T_A)\\exp(T_B)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{H} = \\exp(-T_B) \\left[ \\exp(-T_A)H_A\\exp(T_A) + \\exp(-T_A)H_B\\exp(T_A) \\right] \\exp(T_B)\n$$\nUsing the commutation relation $[H_B, T_A] = 0$, we have $\\exp(-T_A)H_B\\exp(T_A) = H_B$. So,\n$$\n\\bar{H} = \\exp(-T_B) \\left[ \\bar{H}_A + H_B \\right] \\exp(T_B)\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{H}_A = \\exp(-T_A)H_A\\exp(T_A)$ is the transformed Hamiltonian for system $A$. Distributing the terms:\n$$\n\\bar{H} = \\exp(-T_B)\\bar{H}_A\\exp(T_B) + \\exp(-T_B)H_B\\exp(T_B)\n$$\nThe operator $\\bar{H}_A$ is constructed from $H_A$ and $T_A$, and thus acts only on the space of $A$. Therefore, it commutes with $T_B$, i.e., $[\\bar{H}_A, T_B] = 0$. This leads to $\\exp(-T_B)\\bar{H}_A\\exp(T_B) = \\bar{H}_A$. The expression for $\\bar{H}$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\bar{H} = \\bar{H}_A + \\bar{H}_B\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{H}_B = \\exp(-T_B)H_B\\exp(T_B)$. The transformed Hamiltonian is additive, just like the original Hamiltonian.\n\nNow, we compute the energy:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_A \\Phi_B | \\bar{H}_A + \\bar{H}_B | \\Phi_A \\Phi_B \\rangle\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_A \\Phi_B | \\bar{H}_A | \\Phi_A \\Phi_B \\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_A \\Phi_B | \\bar{H}_B | \\Phi_A \\Phi_B \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\bar{H}_A$ acts only on $A$ and $\\bar{H}_B$ acts only on $B$, we can separate the integrals:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_A | \\bar{H}_A | \\Phi_A \\rangle \\langle \\Phi_B | \\Phi_B \\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_A | \\Phi_A \\rangle \\langle \\Phi_B | \\bar{H}_B | \\Phi_B \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the normalization condition $\\langle \\Phi_i | \\Phi_i \\rangle = 1$ for $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$, and recognizing the definition of the monomer CCSD energies, $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(A) = \\langle \\Phi_A | \\bar{H}_A | \\Phi_A \\rangle$ and $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(B) = \\langle \\Phi_B | \\bar{H}_B | \\Phi_B \\rangle$, we arrive at the final result:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(AB) = E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(A) + E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(B)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that CCSD is rigorously size-extensive.\n\nPart II: Analysis of CISD Size-Extensivity Error\n\nWe analyze the minimal model provided for CISD.\nFor the monomer, the basis is $\\{|\\Phi \\rangle, |D \\rangle\\}$ and the Hamiltonian is $H_{\\text{mono}} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_0 & V \\\\ V & E_0 + \\Delta \\end{pmatrix}$.

This hands-on practice explores how point-group symmetry imposes strict selection rules on the single and double excitation amplitudes in both CCSD and EOM-CCSD.

It is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the application of group theory to quantum mechanics, specifically to determine which electronic excitations are allowed by the spatial symmetry of a molecule. The electronic Hamiltonian, $H$, of a molecule commutes with all symmetry operations, $P_g$, of its point group, i.e., $[H, P_g] = 0$. Consequently, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian must transform as one of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the point group.\n\nThe reference state is the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) determinant, $|\\Phi_0 \\rangle$, which for a closed-shell molecule is always totally symmetric. In the $\\mathrm{C_{2v}}$ point group, this corresponds to the $\\mathrm{A_1}$ irrep.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Selection Rules**\n\nFor the Coupled Cluster (CC) ground state, $|\\Psi_0 \\rangle = \\exp(T)|\\Phi_0 \\rangle$, the state must also be totally symmetric ($\\mathrm{A_1}$), as the true ground state of a nondegenerate molecule must be. The cluster operator is $T=T_1+T_2$. The expansion of the exponential is $\\exp(T) = 1 + T + \\frac{1}{2}T^2 + \\dots$. For $\\exp(T)|\\Phi_0 \\rangle$ to have purely $\\mathrm{A_1}$ symmetry, given that $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ has $\\mathrm{A_1}$ symmetry, the operator $T$ itself must be totally symmetric. Any component of $T$ transforming as a non-totally symmetric irrep would generate states of that other symmetry when acting on $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. Thus, $T$ must transform as $\\mathrm{A_1}$.\n\nAn excitation operator's symmetry is determined by the direct product of the irreps of the orbitals from which an electron is removed (hole state) and to which an electron is promoted (particle state). An annihilation operator for an electron in orbital $\\phi_k$ transforms as the complex conjugate of the irrep of $\\phi_k$, $\\Gamma_k^*$. A creation operator transforms as $\\Gamma_k$. For the real irreps of $\\mathrm{C_{2v}}$, $\\Gamma^* = \\Gamma$. Thus, the state created by a single excitation $i \\to a$, which is represented by the operator $a_i^a$, transforms as $\\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_i$.\n\nFor the cluster operator $T$ to be totally symmetric, each of its constituent excitation operators must transform as $\\mathrm{A_1}$:\n- For a single excitation $a_i^a$ to be in $T_1$: $\\Gamma(a_i^a) = \\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_i = \\mathrm{A_1}$.\n- For a double excitation $a_{ij}^{ab}$ to be in $T_2$: $\\Gamma(a_{ij}^{ab}) = \\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_b \\otimes \\Gamma_i \\otimes \\Gamma_j = \\mathrm{A_1}$.\n\nFor the Equation-of-Motion (EOM) excited state, $|\\Psi_E \\rangle = R |\\Psi_0 \\rangle$, we desire a state that transforms as a specific irrep $\\Gamma_E$. The reference state $|\\Psi_0 \\rangle$ has $\\mathrm{A_1}$ symmetry.

Therefore, the excitation operator $R$ must transform as the target irrep, $\\Gamma_E$.\n\nFor the operator $R = R_1+R_2$ to generate a state of symmetry $\\Gamma_E$, its constituent single and double excitation operators must transform according to $\\Gamma_E$:\n- For a single excitation $a_i^a$ in $R_1$: $\\Gamma(a_i^a) = \\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_i = \\Gamma_E$.\n- For a double excitation $a_{ij}^{ab}$ in $R_2$: $\\Gamma(a_{ij}^{ab}) = \\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_b \\otimes \\Gamma_i \\otimes \\Gamma_j = \\Gamma_E$.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of Excitation Counts**\n\nWe are given the orbital counts per irrep:\n- Occupied: $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{A_{1}})=3$, $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{A_{2}})=1$, $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{B_{1}})=2$, $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{B_{2}})=2$.\n- Virtual: $n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{A_{1}})=4$, $n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{A_{2}})=2$, $n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{B_{1}})=3$, $n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{B_{2}})=3$.\n\nThe direct product rules for $\\mathrm{C_{2v}}$ are used throughout.\n\n_Part A: Excitations for the CCSD operator $T$ (Ground State, $\\mathrm{A_1}$)_\n\nNumber of single excitations ($N_{T_1}$): The rule is $\\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_i = \\mathrm{A_1}$, which requires $\\Gamma_a = \\Gamma_i$.\n- $\\mathrm{A_1} \\to \\mathrm{A_1}$: $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{A_1}) \\times n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{A_1}) = 3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n- $\\mathrm{A_2} \\to \\mathrm{A_2}$: $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{A_2}) \\times n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{A_2}) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n- $\\mathrm{B_1} \\to \\mathrm{B_1}$: $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{B_1}) \\times n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{B_1}) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n- $\\mathrm{B_2} \\to \\mathrm{B_2}$: $n_{\\mathrm{occ}}(\\mathrm{B_2}) \\times n_{\\mathrm{vir}}(\\mathrm{B_2}) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n$$N_{T_{1}} = 12 + 2 + 6 + 6 = 26$$\n\nNumber of double excitations ($N_{T_2}$): The rule is $(\\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_b) \\otimes (\\Gamma_i \\otimes \\Gamma_j) = \\mathrm{A_1}$, which requires $\\Gamma_a \\otimes \\Gamma_b = \\Gamma_i \\otimes \\Gamma_j$.
