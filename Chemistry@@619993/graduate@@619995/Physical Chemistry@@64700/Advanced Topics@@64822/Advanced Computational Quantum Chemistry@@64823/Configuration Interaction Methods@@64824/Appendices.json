A solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of Configuration Interaction is the expansion of the exact many-electron wavefunction in a basis of Slater determinants. These determinants are constructed from a set of one-electron spin-orbitals, which are partitioned into occupied spin-orbitals (in the reference Hartree-Fock determinant, $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$) and virtual (unoccupied) spin-orbitals.\n\nAn excited determinant of rank $k$ is formed by promoting $k$ electrons from $k$ distinct occupied spin-orbitals to $k$ distinct virtual spin-orbitals. We are asked to find the number of unique Slater determinants that can be generated for a given excitation rank $k$. Let this number be $N_k$.\n\nThe process of creating a $k$-fold excited determinant involves two independent choices:\n1.  Choosing which $k$ occupied spin-orbitals to depopulate.\n2.  Choosing which $k$ virtual spin-orbitals to populate.\n\nGiven $n_o$ occupied spin-orbitals, the number of ways to choose $k$ distinct spin-orbitals from this set is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_o}{k}$.\n$$ \\binom{n_o}{k} = \\frac{n_o!}{k!(n_o - k)!} $$\nThis expression is valid for $0 \\le k \\le n_o$.\n\nSimilarly, given $n_v$ virtual spin-orbitals, the number of ways to choose $k$ distinct spin-orbitals to place the excited electrons into is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n_v}{k}$.\n$$ \\binom{n_v}{k} = \\frac{n_v!}{k!(n_v - k)!} $$\nThis is valid for $0 \\le k \\le n_v$.\n\nSince the choice of occupied orbitals and the choice of virtual orbitals are independent, the total number of distinct $k$-fold excited determinants, $N_k$, is the product of these two combinatorial factors.\n$$ N_k = \\binom{n_o}{k} \\binom{n_v}{k} $$\nThis is the general counting expression for the number of distinct $k$-fold excited determinants in a spin-orbital basis. Note that for $k=0$, we have $N_0 = \\binom{n_o}{0}\\binom{n_v}{0} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$, which represents the single Hartree-Fock reference determinant itself.\n\nThe total dimension of a truncated CI space is the sum of the number of determinants at each included excitation level.\nThe CIS (Configuration Interaction Singles) space includes the reference determinant ($k=0$) and all single excitations ($k=1$). Its dimension, $D_{CIS}$, is:\n$$ D_{CIS} = N_0 + N_1 = 1 + \\binom{n_o}{1}\\binom{n_v}{1} = 1 + n_o n_v $$\n\nThe CISD (Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles) space includes the reference, singles, and doubles ($k=2$).

The dimension of the CI space, $D_{CI}$, dictates the size of the Hamiltonian matrix, $\\mathbf{H}$, which must be constructed and diagonalized. The matrix has dimensions $D_{CI} \\times D_{CI}$. The computational cost of a CI calculation has two dominant components:\n$1$. Construction of the Hamiltonian matrix elements $H_{IJ} = \\langle \\Psi_I | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_J \\rangle$. The number of such elements is approximately $\\frac{1}{2}D_{CI}^2$.\n$2$. Diagonalization of the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ to obtain its eigenvalues (energies) and eigenvectors (wavefunctions). Standard diagonalization algorithms scale as $O(D_{CI}^3)$. For large problems, iterative methods like the Davidson algorithm are employed, with a cost that scales roughly as $O(N_{iter} D_{CI}^2)$ per root, where $N_{iter}$ is the number of iterations required for convergence.\n\nThe expressions derived show that $D_{CI}$ grows combinatorially with the excitation level $k$ and polynomially with the number of orbitals ($n_o$ and $n_v$). Specifically, for a fixed large $k$, $N_k \\sim O(n_o^k n_v^k)$. This rapid, factorial-like growth is known as the \"exponential wall\" of quantum chemistry. As seen from our calculation ($51 \\to 501 \\to 1701$), even for a small system and low excitation levels, the dimension of the CI matrix increases dramatically.
