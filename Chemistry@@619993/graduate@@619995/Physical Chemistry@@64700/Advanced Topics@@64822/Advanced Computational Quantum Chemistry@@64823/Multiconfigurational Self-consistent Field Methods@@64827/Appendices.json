Here, we analyze the lowest singlet state. For a homonuclear diatomic molecule (point group $D_{\\infty h}$), symmetry considerations are critical.\n\nThe CSFs given span the singlet manifold of the $(2,2)$ active space. We must determine their symmetries. The orbitals have symmetries $\\phi_g \\in \\Sigma_g$ and $\\phi_u \\in \\Sigma_u$ (assuming a $\\sigma$ bond).\n-   $\\vert \\phi_{g}^{2} \\rangle$: This closed-shell configuration has symmetry $\\Sigma_g \\otimes \\Sigma_g = \\Sigma_g$. Spin part is singlet. Overall state symmetry is $^1\\Sigma_g^+$.\n-   $\\vert \\phi_{u}^{2} \\rangle$: This closed-shell configuration has symmetry $\\Sigma_u \\otimes \\Sigma_u = \\Sigma_g$. Spin part is singlet. Overall state symmetry is $^1\\Sigma_g^+$.\n-   $\\vert \\phi_{g}^{1}\\phi_{u}^{1}; S{=}0 \\rangle$: This open-shell configuration has spatial symmetry $\\Sigma_g \\otimes \\Sigma_u = \\Sigma_u$. Spin part is singlet. Overall state symmetry is $^1\\Sigma_u^+$.\n\nThe electronic Hamiltonian is totally symmetric. Therefore, it does not mix states of different symmetries. The lowest electronic state of a typical homonuclear diatomic molecule like $\\mathrm{H}_2$ is of $^1\\Sigma_g^+$ symmetry for all internuclear distances $R$. Consequently, its wave function can only be a linear combination of CSFs with $^1\\Sigma_g^+$ symmetry. This imposes the constraint that $c_{2}=0$ for all $R$.\n\nThe wave function for the lowest singlet state is correctly written as:\n$$\n\\vert \\Psi_{\\mathrm{CAS}} \\rangle \\;=\\; c_{1}\\,\\vert \\phi_{g}^{2} \\rangle \\;+\\; c_{3}\\,\\vert \\phi_{u}^{2} \\rangle\n$$\nwith $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2} + \\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}=1$.\n\nThe natural orbital occupation numbers (NOONs) are the expectation values of the number operators for each orbital. They are given by:\n$n_{g} = \\langle \\Psi_{\\mathrm{CAS}} | \\hat{n}_g | \\Psi_{\\mathrm{CAS}} \\rangle = 2\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2} + 1\\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2} + 0\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}$\n$n_{u} = \\langle \\Psi_{\\mathrm{CAS}} | \\hat{n}_u | \\Psi_{\\mathrm{CAS}} \\rangle = 0\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2} + 1\\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2} + 2\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}$\nWith $c_{2}=0$, these simplify to $n_{g} = 2\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}$ and $n_{u} = 2\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}$.\n\nLet us analyze the two limits:\n\n1.  **Near Equilibrium ($R \\approx R_e$)**: The energy gap $\\Delta = \\epsilon_{u}-\\epsilon_{g}$ is large. To minimize the energy, the system will preferentially occupy the lowest-energy orbital, $\\phi_g$. The ground state is therefore dominated by the Hartree-Fock-like configuration $\\vert \\phi_{g}^{2} \\rangle$.\n    -   **CI Weights**: $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2} \\approx 1$ and $\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2} \\approx 0$.\n    -   **NOONs**: $n_{g} \\approx 2(1)=2$ and $n_{u} \\approx 2(0)=0$.\n    -   **Character**: The system is of single-reference character.\n\n2.  **At Dissociation ($R \\to \\infty$)**: The molecule separates into two neutral atoms, each with one of the active electrons. The orbitals $\\phi_g$ and $\\phi_u$ become degenerate combinations of the atomic orbitals $\\chi_A$ and $\\chi_B$: $\\phi_g \\propto (\\chi_A + \\chi_B)$ and $\\phi_u \\propto (\\chi_A - \\chi_B)$.\n    A correct description of two neutral atoms requires the total wave function to be purely covalent, with no ionic contributions like $\\mathrm{A}^+\\mathrm{B}^-$ or $\\mathrm{A}^-\\mathrm{B}^+$. Expressing the CSFs in terms of atomic orbitals reveals that both $\\vert \\phi_{g}^{2} \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\phi_{u}^{2} \\rangle$ contain equal parts covalent and ionic character. The specific linear combination that perfectly cancels the ionic terms is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\vert \\phi_g^2 \\rangle - \\vert \\phi_u^2 \\rangle)$. The variational principle within CASSCF finds precisely this solution at the dissociation limit.\n    -   **CI Weights**: This requires $c_{1} = -c_{3}$. With the normalization condition $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2} + \\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}=1$, we get $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2} = \\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2} = 1/2$.\n    -   **NOONs**: $n_{g} = 2(1/2)=1$ and $n_{u} = 2(1/2)=1$.\n    -   **Character**: Two CSFs having equal, large weights is the definition of strong (or static) multireference character. The NOONs deviating significantly from $2$ and $0$ to become $1$ and $1$ is a key signature of this diradical character.\n\n**Summary of Correct Trend**: As $R$ increases from $R_e$ to $\\infty$:\n-   CI weights $(\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}, \\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2}, \\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2})$ evolve from $(\\approx 1, 0, \\approx 0)$ to $(1/2, 0, 1/2)$.\n-   NOONs $\\{n_{g}, n_{u}\\}$ evolve from $\\{\\approx 2, \\approx 0\\}$ to $\\{1, 1\\}$.\n-   The system transitions from single-reference to strongly multireference.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each option against this correct derivation.\n\n**A. Near $R_{e}$, $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}\\approx 1$ and $\\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2},\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}\\approx 0$; as $R\\to\\infty$, the variationally optimized orbitals localize and the open-shell CSF dominates with $\\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2}\\to 1$ while $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2},\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}\\to 0$, and the natural occupations evolve from $\\{n_{g},n_{u}\\}\\approx \\{2,0\\}$ at $R_{e}$ to $\\{1,1\\}$ at dissociation, reflecting strong multireference character.**\n\n-   The description at $R_e$ is correct.\n-   The description of CI weights at $R\\to\\infty$ is **Incorrect**. It claims $\\lvert c_2 \\rvert^2 \\to 1$. As established by symmetry, $c_2$ must be zero for the lowest singlet state ($^1\\Sigma_g^+$). This option describes the behavior of an excited state, $^1\\Sigma_u^+$, or the lowest triplet state.\n-   The evolution of natural occupations from $\\{\\approx 2,0\\}$ to $\\{1,1\\}$ is **Correct**. This is a key physical signature of bond breaking.\n-   The conclusion that this reflects strong multireference character is **Correct**.\n-   **Verdict**: This option describes the correct overall physical transformation—the emergence of multireference character and the resulting NOONs—but it incorrectly identifies the contributing CSFs. The error is in the specifics of the wave function composition.\n\n**B. Near $R_{e}$, $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}\\approx 1$; as $R\\to\\infty$, the lowest singlet becomes an equal mixture of the two closed-shell CSFs with $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}=\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}=1/2$ and $\\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2}=0$, while the natural occupations remain fixed at $\\{2,0\\}$ for all $R$, indicating no change in multireference character.**\n\n-   The description at $R_e$ is correct.\n-   The description of CI weights at $R\\to\\infty$ ($\\lvert c_1 \\rvert^2 = \\lvert c_3 \\rvert^2 = 1/2, c_2 = 0$) is **Correct**.\n-   The claim that NOONs remain fixed at $\\{2,0\\}$ is **Incorrect**. It is also logically inconsistent with the stated change in CI weights. If the weights change, the NOONs must change.\n-   The conclusion of \"no change in multireference character\" is **Incorrect**.\n-   **Verdict**: This option correctly identifies the CI coefficients but draws patently false and self-contradictory conclusions about the physical properties (NOONs) and the nature of the electronic structure change.\n\n**C. Near $R_{e}$, the antibonding closed-shell configuration is stabilized so $\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}\\approx 1$; as $R$ increases, $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}$ grows and dominates at dissociation, with natural occupations evolving from $\\{0,2\\}$ at $R_{e}$ to $\\{2,0\\}$ at dissociation, indicating decreasing multireference character.**\n\n-   The initial condition $\\lvert c_3 \\rvert^2 \\approx 1$ for the lowest singlet state is physically absurd, as it implies double occupation of the high-energy antibonding orbital at equilibrium.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The CI weights are invariant with $R$ in CASSCF because the active space is fixed, so $\\lvert c_{i}\\rvert^{2}$ and $\\{n_{g},n_{u}\\}$ do not change along the stretch; multireference character is constant.**\n\n-   This statement fundamentally misunderstands the \"SCF\" part of CASSCF, where orbitals and CI coefficients are simultaneously optimized at each geometry $R$. Both change dramatically during bond dissociation.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. As $R\\to\\infty$, all three CSFs acquire equal weight $\\lvert c_{1}\\rvert^{2}=\\lvert c_{2}\\rvert^{2}=\\lvert c_{3}\\rvert^{2}=1/3$, and the natural occupations approach $\\{4/3,2/3\\}$, reflecting maximal multireference character.**\n\n-   The claim of equal weights for all three CSFs is **Incorrect**. It violates symmetry ($c_2=0$) and there is no physical basis for such equipartition.\n-   The stated NOONs $\\{4/3, 2/3\\}$ are inconsistent with the stated weights. With $|c_i|^2 = 1/3$, the NOONs would be $n_g = 2(1/3)+1(1/3)=1$ and $n_u = 1(1/3)+2(1/3)=1$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNone of the options are entirely correct. Option A incorrectly identifies the form of the wave function at dissociation but correctly describes the initial state, the evolution of the natural occupations, and the emergence of strong multireference character. Option B correctly identifies the form of the wave function but is grossly incorrect and self-contradictory regarding the consequences for occupations and multireference character.\n\nThe question asks for the option that **best captures** the qualitative trend. The central physical concept being tested is the transition from a single-reference to a multireference state upon bond breaking, which is most directly diagnosed by the evolution of the NOONs from integer values ($2,0$) to degenerate values ($1,1$). Option A correctly identifies this crucial trend and its interpretation. The error in Option A is misidentifying the specific CSFs for the lowest state, a mistake of symmetry analysis. The error in Option B is a fundamental logical failure to connect the wave function to its properties. Therefore, Option A provides a superior, albeit flawed, description of the overall physics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2653994"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most critical step in performing a successful CASSCF calculation is the selection of the active space.

Use a threshold $\\tau = 0.05$ on the per-orbital deviation from idempotency to classify static correlation; quantify the static correlation as approximately $0.05 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.15 = 1.20$ electrons of static correlation, ensuring that all non-integer occupations above this tolerance are treated as static.\n\nC. Propose $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$ including all six orbitals, because any deviation from $2$ or $0$ indicates static correlation. Use no threshold (i.e., any deviation counts); quantify the static correlation as approximately $0.02 + 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.15 + 0.10 = 1.32$ electrons of static correlation.\n\nD. Propose $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,3)$ including the orbitals with occupations $1.80$, $1.20$, and $0.15$, and use a threshold $\\tau = 0.10$ on per-orbital deviation; quantify the static correlation as approximately $0.20 + 0.80 + 0.15 = 1.15$ electrons of static correlation, arguing that a small but nonzero occupation such as $0.15$ must be treated as static to avoid biasing the reference.", "solution": "The problem asks for the proposal of a minimally sufficient Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) active space for a molecular system, given a set of natural orbital occupation numbers from a prior multireference calculation. The choice must be justified with a threshold criterion and a quantitative assessment of static correlation.\n\nThe first principles for selecting a CASSCF active space based on natural orbital occupation numbers are as follows:\n1.  In a single-determinant Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, spatial orbital occupation numbers are strictly $2$ (for occupied orbitals in a closed-shell system) or $0$ (for virtual orbitals). This property is related to the idempotency of the one-particle density matrix.\n2.  Electron correlation causes deviations from this picture. Natural orbital occupation numbers become fractional, lying in the interval $[0, 2]$.\n3.  Static (or nondynamical) correlation is associated with near-degeneracy of electronic configurations and is characterized by natural orbitals having occupation numbers that deviate *significantly* from $2$ or $0$. These orbitals are termed \"active\" and must be included in the CASSCF active space.\n4.  Dynamic correlation is associated with the short-range electron-electron cusp and involves contributions from a vast number of configurations with small weights. It results in natural orbitals having occupation numbers that deviate only *slightly* from $2$ or $0$. These orbitals are typically excluded from the active space to keep the calculation computationally tractable and are treated with post-CASSCF methods (e.g., CASPT2, NEVPT2, MRCI).\n5.  A \"minimally sufficient\" active space for static correlation should therefore include all orbitals whose occupation numbers are far from $0$ or $2$, based on a chosen deviation threshold, while excluding those with occupations close to $0$ or $2$.\n6.  The notation for a complete active space is $\\mathrm{CAS}(N, M)$, where $N$ is the number of active electrons and $M$ is the number of active spatial orbitals. A consistent choice of $N$ is typically made by summing the occupation numbers of the selected active orbitals and rounding to the nearest integer.\n\nThe given natural occupation numbers for six valence spatial orbitals are $\\{1.98, 1.95, 1.80, 1.20, 0.15, 0.10\\}$.\nLet us analyze the deviation of each occupation number $n$ from an integer value ($0$ or $2$). A reasonable measure of deviation is $\\min(|n-0|, |n-2|)$.\n-   $n_1 = 1.98$: deviation is $2 - 1.98 = 0.02$.\n-   $n_2 = 1.95$: deviation is $2 - 1.95 = 0.05$.\n-   $n_3 = 1.80$: deviation is $2 - 1.80 = 0.20$.\n-   $n_4 = 1.20$: deviation is $\\min(1.20, 2 - 1.20) = \\min(1.20, 0.80) = 0.80$. Alternatively, the deviation from the nearest integer $1$ is $0.20$. In any scientifically sound interpretation, this orbital shows a very large deviation from idempotency.\n-   $n_5 = 0.15$: deviation is $0.15 - 0 = 0.15$.\n-   $n_6 = 0.10$: deviation is $0.10 - 0 = 0.10$.\n\nThe two orbitals with occupations $n_3 = 1.80$ and $n_4 = 1.20$ exhibit the largest deviations from the single-determinant values of $0$ or $2$. The other orbitals have significantly smaller deviations ($0.05, 0.02$ for the mostly filled; $0.15, 0.10$ for the mostly empty). Therefore, a \"minimally sufficient\" active space to capture the essential static correlation must include the two orbitals with occupations $1.80$ and $1.20$. The number of active orbitals is $M=2$. The number of active electrons, $N$, should be the sum of their occupations: $N = 1.80 + 1.20 = 3.00$. Thus, a proper minimal active space based on this data is $\\mathrm{CAS}(3,2)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given options.\n\n**A. Propose $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ including the two orbitals with occupations $1.80$ and $1.20$, and exclude the orbitals with occupations $1.98$, $1.95$, $0.15$, and $0.10$. Use a threshold $\\tau = 0.20$ on the per-orbital deviation from idempotency to classify static correlation; quantify the static correlation as the sum over the included orbitals of their deviations, giving approximately $0.20 + 0.80 = 1.00$ electrons of static correlation, consistent with a single electron pair distributed over two near-degenerate orbitals.**\n\n-   **Orbital Selection**: The option correctly identifies the two orbitals with the largest deviations ($1.80$ and $1.20$) as the active ones, which is consistent with the principle of a minimal active space.\n-   **Threshold Criterion**: A threshold of $\\tau = 0.20$ on deviation is proposed. The deviations for the orbitals are $\\{0.02, 0.05, 0.20, \\dots\\}$. For $n=1.80$, the deviation $2-1.80=0.20 \\ge \\tau$. For $n=1.20$, the deviation is large, clearly exceeding $\\tau$. For all other orbitals, the deviations ($0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.10$) are less than $0.20$. Thus, the proposed threshold $\\tau=0.20$ consistently and uniquely selects the two orbitals with occupations $1.80$ and $1.20$. This part of the reasoning is sound.\n-   **CAS a priori designation**: The option proposes $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$. This is incorrect. The sum of the occupation numbers for the selected orbitals is $1.80 + 1.20 = 3.0$. This implies $N=3$ electrons, not $2$.\n-   **Physical Description**: The option claims consistency with \"a single electron pair,\" which means $2$ electrons. This is in direct contradiction with the data, which indicates $3$ electrons in the active space.\n\nDespite the incorrect designation $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ and the flawed physical description, this option correctly identifies the minimal set of active orbitals based on a consistently applied threshold. This is the most critical step in answering the problem.\n\n**B. Propose $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$ including the orbitals with occupations $1.95$, $1.80$, $1.20$, and $0.15$. Use a threshold $\\tau = 0.05$ on the per-orbital deviation from idempotency to classify static correlation; quantify the static correlation as approximately $0.05 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.15 = 1.20$ electrons of static correlation, ensuring that all non-integer occupations above this tolerance are treated as static.**\n\n-   **Orbital Selection and Threshold**: It proposes a threshold of $\\tau = 0.05$. The deviations are $\\{0.02, 0.05, 0.20, \\dots, 0.15, 0.10\\}$. With this threshold, one should include orbitals with occupations $1.95$ (dev=$0.05$), $1.80$ (dev=$0.20$), $1.20$ (large dev), $0.15$ (dev=$0.15$), and $0.10$ (dev=$0.10$). The option includes the orbital with $n=1.95$ but excludes the one with $n=0.10$, which is inconsistent with its own threshold. The inclusion of the orbital with $n=1.95$ is also questionable for a minimal space for *static* correlation.\n-   **CAS a priori designation**: The sum of occupations for the selected orbitals is $1.95 + 1.80 + 1.20 + 0.15 = 5.10$. Proposing a $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$ with 4 electrons is inconsistent with this sum. A $\\mathrm{CAS}(5,4)$ would be more justifiable.\nThis option is internally inconsistent and proposes a non-minimal active space. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Propose $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$ including all six orbitals, because any deviation from $2$ or $0$ indicates static correlation. Use no threshold (i.e., any deviation counts); quantify the static correlation as approximately $0.02 + 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.15 + 0.10 = 1.32$ electrons of static correlation.**\n\n-   **Orbital Selection**: This option violates the \"minimally sufficient\" criterion by including all orbitals, even those with very small deviations ($0.02, 0.05$) typical of dynamic correlation. The premise that *any* deviation indicates static correlation is a gross oversimplification that ignores the fundamental distinction between static and dynamic correlation.\n-   **CAS a priori designation**: It proposes $\\mathrm{CAS}(6,6)$, meaning $N=6$ electrons. The sum of all occupations is $1.98 + 1.95 + 1.80 + 1.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 = 7.18$. A choice of $N=6$ is not well-justified; $N=7$ would be a more reasonable choice.\nThis option fails to provide a minimal space. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Propose $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,3)$ including the orbitals with occupations $1.80$, $1.20$, and $0.15$, and use a threshold $\\tau = 0.10$ on per-orbital deviation; quantify the static correlation as approximately $0.20 + 0.80 + 0.15 = 1.15$ electrons of static correlation, arguing that a small but nonzero occupation such as $0.15$ must be treated as static to avoid biasing the reference.**\n\n-   **Orbital Selection and Threshold**: It proposes a threshold of $\\tau=0.10$. This would select orbitals with occupations $1.80$ (dev=$0.20$), $1.20$ (large dev), $0.15$ (dev=$0.15$), and $0.10$ (dev=$0.10$). The option proposes a 3-orbital space, excluding the orbital with $n=0.10$, which contradicts its own threshold criterion.\n-   **CAS a priori designation**: The sum of occupations for the proposed active orbitals is $1.80 + 1.20 + 0.15 = 3.15$. The proposal of $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,3)$ with $N=2$ electrons is inconsistent with this sum. A $\\mathrm{CAS}(3,3)$ would be more appropriate.\nThis option is internally inconsistent. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll options contain significant flaws, particularly in matching the number of active electrons $N$ to the sum of the orbital occupations. However, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies the minimal set of orbitals responsible for the dominant static correlation and proposes a threshold that is perfectly consistent with this selection. The errors in Option A, while substantial (incorrect $N$ and physical description), are in the subsequent labeling and interpretation, not in the primary, most crucial step of identifying the active space composition. The other options fail at this primary step, either by being non-minimal or by being internally inconsistent in their selection logic. Therefore, Option A represents the \"best\" or \"most correct\" choice among a set of flawed options, as it demonstrates the most sound physical reasoning in constructing the minimal active space itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2654001"}]}
