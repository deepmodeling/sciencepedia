The number of particles is constant at any temperature $T$. At absolute zero, $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution function is a step function: $f(\\varepsilon, T=0)=1$ for $\\varepsilon < \\varepsilon_{F}$ and $f(\\varepsilon, T=0)=0$ for $\\varepsilon > \\varepsilon_{F}$, where $\\varepsilon_{F}$ is the Fermi energy, which equals the chemical potential at $T=0$, i.e., $\\mu(0) = \\varepsilon_{F}$.

The shift from $\\varepsilon_{F}$ is negative and quadratically dependent on temperature ($\\propto T^2$). This behavior is a direct consequence of the need to conserve the total number of particles $N$ in a system where the density of states $D(\\varepsilon)$ is an increasing function of energy (for a $3$-dimensional gas, $D(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$). At finite temperature, the Fermi-Dirac distribution \"smears out\", causing some particles to be thermally excited from states below $\\mu$ to states above $\\mu$. Because $D(\\varepsilon)$ is larger at higher energies, more states are available for occupation above $\\mu$ than are being vacated below $\\mu$. If $\\mu$ were to remain constant at $\\varepsilon_{F}$, this asymmetric smearing into a region of higher state density would lead to an increase in the total particle count. To maintain a constant $N$, the chemical potential must shift to a lower energy, thereby slightly reducing the overall occupation of states to precisely compensate for this effect. The $T^{2}$ dependence is characteristic of low-temperature phenomena in Fermi systems and arises from the mathematical structure of the Sommerfeld expansion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\varepsilon_{F} - \\frac{\\pi^{2} (k_{B}T)^{2}}{12 \\varepsilon_{F}}}\n$$", "id": "2625463"}, {"introduction": "We now turn our focus to the signature phenomenon of integer-spin particles: Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC).
