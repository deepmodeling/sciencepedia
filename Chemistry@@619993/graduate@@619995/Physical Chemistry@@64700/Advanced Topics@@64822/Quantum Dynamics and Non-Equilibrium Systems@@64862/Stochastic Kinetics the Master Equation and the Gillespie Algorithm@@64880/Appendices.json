Constructing this array of $R$ elements requires a sequential summation, which is an $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ operation.\n3.  Once the cumulative sum array is built, finding the correct index $J$ by a linear scan also takes, on average and in the worst case, $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ time.

Since each evaluation is assumed to be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, this part of the step costs $\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{d})$.\n\nThe total computational cost per step is the sum of the costs for selection and updates, which is $\\mathcal{O}(R + \\bar{d})$. The statement is a correct assessment of the complexity of this naive algorithm.\n\n**Verdict on A**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B**\n\nThis statement considers a slight optimization where the total propensity $a_0$ is not recomputed from scratch but is maintained incrementally.\n\n1.  Following a reaction, $\\bar{d}$ propensities change. For each affected propensity $a_\\mu$, we can find the change $\\Delta a_\\mu = a_\\mu^{\\text{new}} - a_\\mu^{\\text{old}}$. The total propensity is then updated via $a_0^{\\text{new}} = a_0^{\\text{old}} + \\sum_{\\text{affected}} \\Delta a_\\mu$. This update process requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{d})$ work.\n2.  With the value of $a_0$ available, sampling the waiting time $\\tau = -\\frac{1}{a_0} \\ln(r_1)$ involves a random number generation, a logarithm, and a division, all of which are $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operations. The first part of the statement is therefore correct.\n3.  However, selecting the reaction index $J$ still requires sampling from the discrete distribution defined by the individual propensities $\\{a_\\mu\\}$. The statement specifies that no additional data structures are used. In this case, the only way to perform the inverse transform sampling is to iterate through the propensities, calculating partial sums on the fly, i.e., finding $J$ such that $\\sum_{\\nu=1}^{J-1} a_\\nu  r_2 a_0 \\leq \\sum_{\\nu=1}^{J} a_\\nu$. This linear scan is an $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ operation.\n\nThe statement correctly decomposes the per-step work and accurately assigns complexity to each part under the given implementation strategy.\n\n**Verdict on B**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C**\n\nThis statement proposes using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), or Fenwick tree, a data structure that enables efficient dynamic prefix sum calculations.\n\n1.  A BIT supports updating the value at a single index and querying the prefix sum up to any index, both in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$ time.\n2.  **Updating propensities**: When $\\bar{d}$ propensities must be updated, this translates to $\\bar{d}$ individual update operations on the BIT. The total cost for this phase is $\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{d} \\log R)$.\n3.  **Sampling $J$**: Selection requires finding the index $J$ corresponding to a value drawn from $U(0, a_0)$. First, the total propensity $a_0$ is found by querying the prefix sum up to $R$, which takes $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$. Then, a search must be performed on the BIT to find the index $J$ for which the prefix sum first exceeds the random threshold. This search on a BIT can be implemented to run in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$ time. Thus, the total selection process is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$.\n4.  The total per-step cost is the sum of the selection and update complexities: $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R) + \\mathcal{O}(\\bar{d}\\log R) = \\mathcal{O}(\\log R + \\bar{d}\\log R)$.\n\nThe statement correctly identifies the complexities of the relevant operations on a BIT and correctly combines them to find the total per-step complexity.\n\n**Verdict on C**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D**\n\nThis statement asserts that SSA selection involves picking the reaction with the largest propensity, $a_{\\mu}$. This premise is fundamentally incorrect. The Stochastic Simulation Algorithm is, by definition, stochastic. The selection rule is probabilistic: reaction $\\mu$ is chosen with a probability proportional to its propensity, $a_{\\mu}$, not because its propensity is the largest. An algorithm that deterministically chooses the reaction with the maximum propensity is not the Gillespie algorithm and would lead to qualitatively different, non-physical system dynamics. A binary heap keyed by propensity values is an efficient data structure for finding the maximum value, but this operation is not relevant for the correct SSA selection step.\n\n**Verdict on D**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement E**\n\nThe alias method is a well-known technique for sampling from a discrete distribution. It consists of an $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ setup phase to build internal tables, after which sampling can be performed in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. In the context of SSA, the underlying probability distribution (defined by the propensities) changes at every step. A naive implementation using the alias method would therefore require executing the expensive $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ setup phase at every single simulation step. The fact that the subsequent sampling is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ does not change the fact that the per-step cost is dominated by the $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ rebuild. The amortized cost is therefore $\\mathcal{O}(R)$, as correctly stated.\n\n**Verdict on E**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement F**\n\nThis statement describes the Next Reaction Method (NRM) of Gibson and Bruck, an exact but structurally different formulation of the SSA. Instead of one waiting time, it maintains $R$ tentative absolute firing times, $\\{T_\\mu\\}$, typically stored in a min-priority queue (e.g., a binary heap).\n\n1.  **Extracting the next reaction**: The next reaction to occur is the one with the minimum firing time, $T_J = \\min_{\\mu} \\{T_\\mu\\}$. Finding and removing this minimum element from a binary heap of size $R$ is an `extract-min` operation, which costs $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$.\n2.  **Updating**: After reaction $J$ fires, the state changes, which in turn alters the propensities of a subset of other reactions. A dependency graph is used to identify these affected reactions, of which there are $\\bar{d}$ on average. For each of these $\\bar{d}$ reactions, its tentative firing time must be recomputed and its position in the heap adjusted. Updating a key in a binary heap is an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$ operation. Performing $\\bar{d}$ such updates costs $\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{d} \\log R)$.\n\nThe statement provides a precise and accurate summary of the computational complexity of the NRM.\n\n**Verdict on F**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement G**\n\nThis statement claims that any data structure providing sublinear selection time for the direct method must have a worst-case update time of $\\mathcal{O}(R)$ for a single propensity change. This claim is false. It incorrectly assumes a necessary trade-off that can be circumvented by appropriate data structures.\n\nThe analysis of statement C provides a definitive counterexample. The Binary Indexed Tree allows for both selection (via an inverse prefix sum search) and single-propensity updates to be performed in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log R)$ time. Since $\\log R$ is sublinear in $R$, this demonstrates that it is possible to achieve sublinear complexity for both operations simultaneously. The statement's reasoning about the \"need to maintain cumulative sums\" is based on a narrow view of implementation; advanced data structures like BITs and segment trees maintain this information implicitly, avoiding the linear-time cost associated with a simple array of cumulative sums.\n\n**Verdict on G**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCEF}$$", "id": "2669219"}]}
