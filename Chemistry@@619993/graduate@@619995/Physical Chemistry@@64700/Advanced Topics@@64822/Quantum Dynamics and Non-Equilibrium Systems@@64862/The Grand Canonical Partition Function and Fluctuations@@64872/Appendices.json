It represents a standard derivation in statistical mechanics and can be solved by starting from the specified first principles. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the $N$-particle classical canonical partition function, $Q_N(T,V)$, for a system of $N$ indistinguishable, non-interacting particles of mass $m$ in a volume $V$ at an inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. Its definition, incorporating the Gibbs correction for indistinguishability, is given by the integral over the $6N$-dimensional phase space:\n$$\nQ_N(T,V) = \\frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} \\int \\prod_{i=1}^N d^3\\mathbf{q}_i d^3\\mathbf{p}_i \\, \\exp(-\\beta H(\\{\\mathbf{q}_i, \\mathbf{p}_i\\}))\n$$\nFor a monoatomic ideal gas, the Hamiltonian $H$ contains only the kinetic energy of the particles and is independent of their positions $\\{\\mathbf{q}_i\\}$:\n$$\nH(\\{\\mathbf{p}_i\\}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}_i|^2}{2m}\n$$\nDue to the separability of the Hamiltonian, the phase-space integral can be factored into integrals over position and momentum coordinates. The integration over the spatial coordinates of the $N$ particles yields the volume term:\n$$\n\\int \\prod_{i=1}^N d^3\\mathbf{q}_i = \\left(\\int_V d^3\\mathbf{q}\\right)^N = V^N\n$$\nThe integration over the momentum coordinates also separates into a product of $N$ identical single-particle integrals:\n$$\n\\int \\prod_{i=1}^N d^3\\mathbf{p}_i \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}_j|^2}{2m}\\right) = \\left[ \\int d^3\\mathbf{p} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta |\\mathbf{p}|^2}{2m}\\right) \\right]^N\n$$\nThe single-particle momentum integral is a standard three-dimensional Gaussian integral:\n$$\n\\int d^3\\mathbf{p} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta |\\mathbf{p}|^2}{2m}\\right) = \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) \\right]^3\n$$\nUsing the result for the one-dimensional Gaussian integral, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}}\n$$\nThis gives the value of the three-dimensional momentum integral as $(2\\pi m/\\beta)^{3/2}$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $Q_N(T,V)$, we find:\n$$\nQ_N(T,V) = \\frac{1}{N! h^{3N}} V^N \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}\\right)^{3N/2} = \\frac{1}{N!} \\left[ V \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m}{h^2 \\beta}\\right)^{3/2} \\right]^N\n$$\nWe define the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda$ as $\\lambda = h\\sqrt{\\beta/(2\\pi m)}$. With this definition, the canonical partition function acquires a compact form:\n$$\nQ_N(T,V) = \\frac{1}{N!} \\left(\\frac{V}{\\lambda^3}\\right)^N\n$$\nThis is the canonical partition function for $N$ classical ideal gas particles. It is related to the single-particle partition function $Q_1 = V/\\lambda^3$ by $Q_N = Q_1^N/N!$.\n\nNow, we move to the grand canonical ensemble (GCE). The grand partition function $\\Xi(T,V,\\mu)$ is defined as a sum over states with all possible particle numbers $N \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$, weighted by the chemical potential $\\mu$ through the activity $z = \\exp(\\beta\\mu)$:\n$$\n\\Xi(T,V,\\mu) = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} z^N Q_N(T,V)\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $Q_N$, we get:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} z^N \\frac{1}{N!} \\left(\\frac{V}{\\lambda^3}\\right)^N = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{N!} \\left(\\frac{zV}{\\lambda^3}\\right)^N\n$$\nThis sum is the Maclaurin series for the exponential function, $\\exp(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^k/k!$. Identifying $x = zV/\\lambda^3$, we find the grand partition function in closed form:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\exp\\left(\\frac{zV}{\\lambda^3}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability $P(N)$ of finding the system with a specific number of particles $N$ is the ratio of the corresponding term in the sum to the total sum $\\Xi$:\n$$\nP(N) = \\frac{z^N Q_N}{\\Xi} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{N!} (zV/\\lambda^3)^N}{\\exp(zV/\\lambda^3)} = \\frac{(zV/\\lambda^3)^N}{N!} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{zV}{\\lambda^3}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the particle-number distribution function. To show it is Poissonian, we compare it to the standard form of a Poisson distribution for a discrete random variable $k$, which is $P(k;\\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha^k e^{-\\alpha}}{k!}$, where $\\alpha$ is the average value $\\langle k \\rangle$. Our derived $P(N)$ matches this form precisely, with the parameter $\\alpha$ given by:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{zV}{\\lambda^3}\n$$\nThus, the distribution of particle numbers is indeed Poissonian. The mean number of particles in the system is $\\langle N \\rangle = \\alpha = zV/\\lambda^3$.\n\nFinally, we compute the variance of the particle number, $\\langle(\\Delta N)^2\\rangle$. A well-known property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean:\n$$\n\\langle(\\Delta N)^2\\rangle = \\langle N^2 \\rangle - \\langle N \\rangle^2 = \\langle N \\rangle\n$$\nTherefore, the number variance for the ideal gas in the GCE is:\n$$\n\\langle(\\Delta N)^2\\rangle = \\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{zV}{\\lambda^3}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the number variance, derived strictly from the given definitions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{zV}{\\lambda^3}}$$", "id": "2816826"}, {"introduction": "Having established the nature of fluctuations in a classical system, we now turn our attention to the quantum world.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive and implement estimators for the critical exponent ratio $\\gamma/\\nu$ and the anomalous dimension $\\eta$ for a $d$-dimensional lattice gas from finite-size scaling (FSS) data at criticality. The data are provided for the per-volume susceptibility $\\kappa(L)$ and the total particle number variance $\\mathrm{Var}(N;L)$ as a function of linear system size $L$.\n\nFirst, we establish the estimator for $\\gamma/\\nu$ from the scaling of the per-volume susceptibility, $\\kappa(L)$. In the theory of critical phenomena, a response function that diverges as $|t|^{-\\lambda}$ in the thermodynamic limit (where $t$ is a measure of distance from the critical point) is expected to scale as $L^{\\lambda/\\nu}$ at the critical point in a finite system of size $L$. The susceptibility is predicted to diverge with exponent $\\gamma$, hence the FSS hypothesis is $\\kappa(L) \\sim L^{\\gamma/\\nu}$. The problem provides a specific functional form for the data:\n$$\n\\kappa(L) = A L^r\n$$\nwhere the exponent $r$ is defined as $r \\equiv \\gamma/\\nu$. To extract this exponent, we perform a transformation to a linear relationship by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\kappa(L)) = \\ln(A) + r \\ln(L)\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $y = c + m x$, with $y = \\ln(\\kappa(L))$, $x = \\ln(L)$, intercept $c = \\ln(A)$, and slope $m = r$. Therefore, the first estimator for $\\gamma/\\nu$, which we denote $(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\kappa}$, is the slope of a linear regression fit to the data points $(\\ln(L), \\ln(\\kappa(L)))$.\n$$\n(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\kappa} = \\frac{d[\\ln(\\kappa(L))]}{d[\\ln(L)]}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the estimator for $\\gamma/\\nu$ from the scaling of the particle number variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(N;L)$. We begin with the fundamental fluctuation-response relation provided:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(N) = V \\kappa\n$$\nThe system volume $V$ for a $d$-dimensional hypercubic system is $V = L^d$. Substituting this and the FSS form for $\\kappa(L)$ gives the scaling of the variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(N;L) = L^d \\kappa(L) \\sim L^d L^{\\gamma/\\nu} = L^{d + \\gamma/\\nu}\n$$\nThe data generation rule given in the problem, $\\mathrm{Var}(N;L) = L^{d} \\, \\kappa(L) = L^d(A L^r) = A L^{d+r}$, is consistent with this derivation. Taking the natural logarithm gives:\n$$\n\\ln(\\mathrm{Var}(N;L)) = \\ln(A) + (d+r) \\ln(L)\n$$\nThis is again a linear relationship. The slope of a plot of $\\ln(\\mathrm{Var}(N;L))$ versus $\\ln(L)$ is $m' = d+r = d+\\gamma/\\nu$. To find the estimator for $\\gamma/\\nu$ from the variance data, denoted $(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{Var}}$, we must compute the slope $m'$ from the regression and subtract the spatial dimension $d$:\n$$\n(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{Var}} = \\frac{d[\\ln(\\mathrm{Var}(N;L))]}{d[\\ln(L)]} - d\n$$\n\nThird, we construct the estimator for the anomalous dimension $\\eta$. The standard scaling relation connecting $\\gamma$, $\\nu$, and $\\eta$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\nu(2-\\eta)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $\\eta$ in terms of the ratio $\\gamma/\\nu$:\n$$\n\\eta = 2 - \\gamma/\\nu\n$$\nAs per the problem specification, we first compute an average estimate for the ratio $\\gamma/\\nu$ from our two independent methods:\n$$\n(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\kappa} + (\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{Var}} \\right]\n$$\nThe final estimator for $\\eta$ is then:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{est}} = 2 - (\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{avg}}\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case $(d, A, r, \\{L_i\\})$ is as follows:\n$1$. Construct the data series $\\{\\kappa(L_i)\\}$ and $\\{\\mathrm{Var}(N;L_i)\\}$ using the given formulas $\\kappa(L) = A L^r$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(N;L) = L^d \\kappa(L)$.\n$2$. Create vectors of logarithmic variables: $x_i = \\ln(L_i)$, $y_{\\kappa,i} = \\ln(\\kappa(L_i))$, and $y_{\\mathrm{Var},i} = \\ln(\\mathrm{Var}(N;L_i))$.\n$3$. Perform a linear regression on $(x_i, y_{\\kappa,i})$ to find the slope $m_{\\kappa}$. This gives the estimate $(\\gamma/\\nu)_\\kappa = m_{\\kappa}$.\n$4$. Perform a linear regression on $(x_i, y_{\\mathrm{Var},i})$ to find the slope $m_{\\mathrm{Var}}$. The estimate is $(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{Var}} = m_{\\mathrm{Var}} - d$.\n$5$. Calculate the average $(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ and the estimate $\\eta_{\\mathrm{est}} = 2 - (\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{avg}}$.\n$6$. Round the three resulting values, $(\\gamma/\\nu)_\\kappa$, $(\\gamma/\\nu)_{\\mathrm{Var}}$, and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{est}}$, to $6$ decimal places for reporting.\n\nThis procedure is applied to all test cases, and the results are aggregated into a single flat list.
