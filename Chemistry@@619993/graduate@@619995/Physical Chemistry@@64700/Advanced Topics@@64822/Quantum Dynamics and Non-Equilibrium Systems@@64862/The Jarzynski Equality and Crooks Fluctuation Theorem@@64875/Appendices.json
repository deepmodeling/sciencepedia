To effectively use this tool, one must first have a solid grasp on the equilibrium quantity $\\Delta F$ itself. This foundational practice explores a simple yet profound scenario—the translation of a potential in space—where physical symmetry dictates that the free energy change must be zero.

Its Hamiltonian under a control parameter $\\ell$ is $H(p,x;\\ell)=\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}+V(x-\\ell)$, where $V$ is a fixed, sufficiently confining potential so that all required integrals converge, and $\\ell$ translates the potential rigidly in space.

Express the final energy in Joules. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical statistical mechanics. We shall proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three things: first, a principled explanation for why the equilibrium Helmholtz free energy change $\\Delta F$ is zero for a simple translation of the potential; second, an explicit verification of this fact by calculating the partition function; and third, a brief commentary on the consistency of this result with non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems.\n\nLet us begin. The Helmholtz free energy $F$ is defined in terms of the canonical partition function $Z$ at a temperature $T$ as\n$$F = -k_B T \\ln Z$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The change in free energy associated with changing the control parameter from $\\ell=0$ to $\\ell=L$ is therefore\n$$\\Delta F = F(L) - F(0) = -k_B T \\ln Z(L) - (-k_B T \\ln Z(0)) = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z(L)}{Z(0)}\\right)$$\nTo demonstrate that $\\Delta F = 0$, we must show that $Z(L) = Z(0)$.\n\nThe classical canonical partition function for a single particle in one dimension with Hamiltonian $H(p,x;\\ell)$ is given by the integral over phase space:\n$$Z(\\ell) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, \\exp(-\\beta H(p,x;\\ell))$$\nwhere $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$ and $h$ is a constant with units of action (Planck's constant) that makes $Z$ dimensionless, though its value is irrelevant for the calculation of $\\Delta F$. Substituting the given Hamiltonian, $H(p,x;\\ell) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x-\\ell)$, we have:\n$$Z(\\ell) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x-\\ell) \\right]\\right)$$\n\nTo prove from first principles that $Z(\\ell)$ is independent of $\\ell$, consider the expression for $Z(L)$:\n$$Z(L) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x-L) \\right]\\right)$$\nIn the spatial integral over $x$, we perform a change of variables. Let $x' = x-L$. Consequently, $x = x'+L$ and the differential element is $dx = dx'$. Since the original integration domain for $x$ is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, the new integration domain for $x'$ is also $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. Substituting this into the expression for $Z(L)$:\n$$Z(L) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx' \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V((x'+L)-L) \\right]\\right)$$\n$$Z(L) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx' \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x') \\right]\\right)$$\nNow, compare this expression with the partition function at $\\ell=0$:\n$$Z(0) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\right]\\right)$$\nThe expressions for $Z(L)$ and $Z(0)$ are identical. The integration variable is a dummy variable; whether it is denoted by $x$ or $x'$ is immaterial to the value of the definite integral. This demonstrates that $Z(L) = Z(0)$ due to the translational invariance of the integration measure over all of space. Thus,\n$$\\Delta F = -k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z(L)}{Z(0)}\\right) = -k_B T \\ln(1) = 0$$\n\nNext, we verify this conclusion by explicitly evaluating $Z(\\ell)$. The integral can be factorized into momentum and position parts:\n$$Z(\\ell) = \\left( \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, \\exp(-\\beta V(x-\\ell)) \\right)$$\nThe momentum integral is a standard Gaussian integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. Here, $a = \\frac{\\beta}{2m}$.\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dp \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m\\pi}{\\beta}} = \\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}$$\nLet us denote the configurational part of the partition function as $Z_x(\\ell)$:\n$$Z_x(\\ell) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, \\exp(-\\beta V(x-\\ell))$$\nAs before, we perform the change of variables $x' = x-\\ell$, so $dx = dx'$. The limits of integration are unchanged.\n$$Z_x(\\ell) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx' \\, \\exp(-\\beta V(x'))$$\nThis integral yields a constant value that depends on the shape of the potential $V$ and the temperature $T$, but it is manifestly independent of the parameter $\\ell$. Let us call this constant $C_V = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta V(x')) dx'$. The problem states the potential is sufficiently confining to ensure this integral converges.\nSo, the full partition function is:\n$$Z(\\ell) = \\frac{1}{h} \\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T} \\cdot C_V$$\nSince this expression for $Z(\\ell)$ does not contain $\\ell$, the partition function is a constant with respect to the control parameter. Therefore, $Z(L) = Z(0)$, and the equilibrium Helmholtz free energy does not change when the potential is translated: $F(L) = F(0)$, which means $\\Delta F = 0$. This explicitly verifies our initial conclusion.\n\nFinally, we comment on the consistency with the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks fluctuation theorem. The Jarzynski equality states that for a non-equilibrium process,\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)$$\nwhere $W$ is the work done on the system and the average is taken over an ensemble of trajectories starting from equilibrium. In our case, we have proven that $\\Delta F = 0$. Therefore, for any process that translates the potential from $\\ell=0$ to $\\ell=L$, the Jarzynski equality becomes:\n$$\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = 1$$\nThis is a non-trivial prediction. Even though for any finite-time process work will be performed and dissipated as heat (by the second law, we expect $\\langle W \\rangle \\ge \\Delta F$, so $\\langle W \\rangle \\ge 0$), the specific exponential average of this work must equal exactly one.\n\nThe Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the probability distribution of work for the forward process, $P_F(W)$, and the time-reversed process, $P_R(-W)$:\n$$\\frac{P_F(W)}{P_R(-W)} = \\exp(\\beta(W - \\Delta F))$$\nFor our system, with $\\Delta F = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{P_F(W)}{P_R(-W)} = \\exp(\\beta W)$$\nThis is known as the fluctuation theorem for a stationary state or, in this symmetric context, it shows a direct relation between the work distribution and its reverse. The result $\\Delta F=0$ is thus fundamentally consistent with these theorems and provides a key input for applying them to this specific physical situation. The physical basis for $\\Delta F=0$ is the homogeneity of space, which means that the equilibrium properties of the system cannot depend on the absolute position of the confining potential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2677133"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from equilibrium analysis to a genuine non-equilibrium process.

We perform a Taylor series expansion of $\\ln(\\bar{X}_{N})$ around the true mean of $X$, which we denote $\\mu_{X} = \\mathbb{E}[X]$.\nLet $\\delta = \\bar{X}_{N} - \\mu_{X}$. The expansion of $\\ln(\\mu_{X} + \\delta)$ is:\n$$\n\\ln(\\bar{X}_{N}) = \\ln(\\mu_{X} + \\delta) = \\ln(\\mu_{X}) + \\frac{\\delta}{\\mu_{X}} - \\frac{\\delta^2}{2\\mu_{X}^{2}} + O(\\delta^3)\n$$\nWe take the expectation of this expression.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(\\bar{X}_{N})] = \\ln(\\mu_{X}) + \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\delta]}{\\mu_{X}} - \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\delta^2]}{2\\mu_{X}^{2}} + O(\\mathbb{E}[\\delta^3])\n$$\nBy definition of $\\delta$, its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta] = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_{N} - \\mu_{X}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{X}_{N}] - \\mu_{X} = \\mu_{X} - \\mu_{X} = 0$.\nThe expectation of its square is the variance of the sample mean: $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(\\bar{X}_{N} - \\mu_{X})^2] = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{N})$.\nSince the $X_i$ are i.i.d., the variance of the sample mean is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{N}) = \\frac{\\text{Var}(X)}{N}$.\nSubstituting these results into the expansion gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(\\bar{X}_{N})] \\approx \\ln(\\mu_{X}) - \\frac{\\text{Var}(X)}{2N\\mu_{X}^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression is accurate to leading order in $1/N$. Now we must find $\\mu_{X}$ and $\\text{Var}(X)$ for the specified log-normal distribution.\nThe problem states that $\\ln X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. The moments of a log-normal random variable $X$ are given by $\\mathbb{E}[X^k] = \\exp(k\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}k^2\\sigma^2)$.\nFor $k=1$, the mean is $\\mu_{X} = \\mathbb{E}[X] = \\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)$.\nFor $k=2$, the second moment is $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \\exp(2\\mu + 2\\sigma^2)$.\nThe variance is $\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2 = \\exp(2\\mu + 2\\sigma^2) - \\left(\\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)\\right)^2$.\n$\\text{Var}(X) = \\exp(2\\mu + 2\\sigma^2) - \\exp(2\\mu + \\sigma^2) = \\exp(2\\mu + \\sigma^2)(\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1)$.\nThe required ratio for the bias term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Var}(X)}{\\mu_{X}^{2}} = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + \\sigma^2)(\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1)}{\\left(\\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + \\sigma^2)(\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1)}{\\exp(2\\mu + \\sigma^2)} = \\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1\n$$\nThus, the expected value of the logarithm of the sample mean is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(\\bar{X}_{N})] \\approx \\ln(\\mu_{X}) - \\frac{\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1}{2N}\n$$\nNow, we relate this back to the free energy. The Jarzynski equality is $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)$, which is precisely $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)$.\nTherefore, $\\mu_{X} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)$, and taking the logarithm gives $\\ln(\\mu_{X}) = -\\beta \\Delta F$. This implies that the true free energy difference is $\\Delta F = -\\beta^{-1}\\ln(\\mu_X)$.\nWe can now write the expected value of the estimator:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\Delta F}_{N}] = -\\beta^{-1}\\mathbb{E}[\\ln(\\bar{X}_{N})] \\approx -\\beta^{-1} \\left( \\ln(\\mu_{X}) - \\frac{\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1}{2N} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta F = -\\beta^{-1}\\ln(\\mu_X)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\Delta F}_{N}] \\approx \\Delta F + \\frac{\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1}{2N\\beta}\n$$\nThe bias $b_{N}$ is defined as $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\Delta F}_{N}] - \\Delta F$. To leading order in $1/N$, this is:\n$$\nb_{N} \\approx \\frac{\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1}{2N\\beta}\n$$\nThe problem requests the dimensionless bias $\\beta b_N$. Multiplying by $\\beta$ gives the final expression for the first part.\n\n**2. Justification of Log-Normality and the JE Constraint**\n\nFirst, we justify that if $W$ is Gaussian, then $X = \\exp(-\\beta W)$ is log-normal. This is straightforward from the definitions. If $W$ is a Gaussian random variable, $W \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_W, \\sigma_W^2)$, then any linear transformation of $W$ is also Gaussian. The variable $\\ln X$ is defined as $\\ln X = \\ln(\\exp(-\\beta W)) = -\\beta W$. As a linear scaling of the Gaussian variable $W$, $\\ln X$ must also be Gaussian. Its mean is $\\mathbb{E}[\\ln X] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\beta W] = -\\beta \\mathbb{E}[W] = -\\beta \\mu_W$, and its variance is $\\text{Var}(\\ln X) = \\text{Var}(-\\beta W) = (-\\beta)^2 \\text{Var}(W) = \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2$.\nTherefore, $\\ln X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-\\beta \\mu_W, \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2)$. This corresponds to the log-normal parameters $\\mu = -\\beta\\mu_W$ and $\\sigma^2 = \\beta^2\\sigma_W^2$. The assumption of Gaussian work $W$ in a CRN is physically justified for protocols that drive the system weakly, corresponding to a near-equilibrium regime. In this limit, the total work can be seen as a sum of many small contributions, invoking a central limit-type argument for its distribution.\n\nSecond, we identify the constraint imposed by the Jarzynski equality on the work statistics. The JE states $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)$. For a log-normal variable $X$ with parameters $(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma^2/2)$.\nEquating these two expressions for $\\mathbb{E}[X]$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\mu + \\sigma^2/2) = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta F)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} = -\\beta \\Delta F\n$$\nNow, substitute the relations for the log-normal parameters in terms of the work statistics: $\\mu = -\\beta \\langle W \\rangle$ and $\\sigma^2 = \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2$.\n$$\n-\\beta \\langle W \\rangle + \\frac{\\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2}{2} = -\\beta \\Delta F\n$$\nDividing by $-\\beta$ (since $\\beta \\neq 0$), we obtain the constraint:\n$$\n\\langle W \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\sigma_W^2 = \\Delta F\n$$\nThis equation reveals that the Jarzynski equality, when combined with the assumption of Gaussian work statistics, does not hold trivially but imposes a strong constraint: the average dissipated work, $\\langle W_{\\text{diss}} \\rangle \\equiv \\langle W \\rangle - \\Delta F$, must be exactly equal to one-half of the work variance scaled by $\\beta$. This is a specific instance of a fluctuation-dissipation relation for a non-equilibrium process.\n\n**3. Bias Mitigation Strategies**\n\nThe derived bias is $b_{N} \\approx \\frac{\\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1}{2N\\beta}$. To mitigate this bias, one must either increase the denominator $N$ or decrease the term $\\exp(\\sigma^2)-1$ in the numerator, which is dominated by $\\sigma^2$. This gives rise to two complementary strategies.\n\n- **Strategy 1: Increase the Protocol Duration $\\tau$ (Physical Strategy).**\nThe log-variance is $\\sigma^2 = \\beta^2 \\sigma_W^2$. The work variance $\\sigma_W^2$ is directly related to the degree of irreversibility of the process. For a fixed transformation from $\\lambda_0$ to $\\lambda_\\tau$, executing the protocol over a longer duration $\\tau$ brings the system closer to the quasi-static limit. This reduces the average rate of entropy production and, consequently, the average dissipated work $\\langle W_{\\text{diss}} \\rangle$. From the relation derived in part 2, $\\langle W_{\\text{diss}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\sigma_W^2$, a reduction in dissipated work directly implies a reduction in work variance $\\sigma_W^2$. Since the bias depends exponentially on $\\sigma^2$, even a modest decrease in $\\sigma_W^2$ achieved by slowing down the protocol can significantly suppress the bias. This strategy respects CFT, as the theorem is valid for any protocol, fast or slow.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Employ a Bidirectional Estimator (Statistical/Algorithmic Strategy).**\nThe Jarzynski estimator is known to be statistically inefficient and heavily biased by rare events with large work values. A superior approach is to collect data not only for the forward process ($A \\to B$ with work $W_F$) but also for the time-reversed process ($B \\to A$ with work $W_R$). The Crooks Fluctuation Theorem provides a direct link between the work distributions: $P_F(W) / P_R(-W) = \\exp(\\beta(W - \\Delta F))$. Estimators such as the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) are derived by finding the $\\Delta F$ that best satisfies this relation for the collected forward and reverse data. By using information from both distributions, BAR effectively focuses on the region of overlap where work values are typical and avoids the high-variance tails that plague the one-sided Jarzynski estimator. This leads to a dramatic reduction in both bias and statistical variance for the same total number of measurements. This strategy is physically grounded as it leverages the fundamental time-reversal symmetry of the dynamics encoded in CFT.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\exp(\\sigma^{2}) - 1}{2N}}\n$$", "id": "2644002"}]}
