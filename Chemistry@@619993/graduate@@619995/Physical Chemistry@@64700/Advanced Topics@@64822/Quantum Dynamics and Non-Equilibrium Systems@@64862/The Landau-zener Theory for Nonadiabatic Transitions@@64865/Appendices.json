The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness and well-posed nature. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to diagonalize the Hamiltonian $H(t)$ to find its instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which correspond to the adiabatic energies and states, respectively. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha t  V \\\\\nV  -\\alpha t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $E$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H(t) - E I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\alpha t - E  V \\\\\nV  -\\alpha t - E\n\\end{pmatrix} = -(\\alpha t - E)(\\alpha t + E) - V^2 = E^2 - (\\alpha t)^2 - V^2 = 0\n$$\nThis yields $E^2 = (\\alpha t)^2 + V^2$. The two eigenvalues are thus:\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(t) = \\pm \\sqrt{(\\alpha t)^2 + V^2}\n$$\nBy convention, $E_{+}(t)$ is the higher energy and $E_{-}(t)$ is the lower energy.\n\nThe adiabatic states $|+(t)\\rangle$ and $|-(t)\\rangle$ are the normalized eigenvectors corresponding to $E_{+}(t)$ and $E_{-}(t)$. The problem parameterizes these states using a mixing angle $\\theta(t)$. The transformation from the diabatic basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$ to the adiabatic basis is described by a rotation matrix. The angle of this rotation, $\\theta(t)$, relates the diabatic and adiabatic representations. For a general $2 \\times 2$ symmetric Hamiltonian of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} H_{11}  H_{12} \\\\ H_{21}  H_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ with $H_{12}=H_{21}$, the mixing angle $\\theta$ satisfies the relation:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2H_{12}}{H_{11} - H_{22}}\n$$\nFor the given Hamiltonian, $H_{11} = \\alpha t$, $H_{22} = -\\alpha t$, and $H_{12} = V$. Substituting these into the formula gives:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta(t)) = \\frac{2V}{\\alpha t - (-\\alpha t)} = \\frac{2V}{2\\alpha t} = \\frac{V}{\\alpha t}\n$$\nThis relation determines $2\\theta(t)$ up to an integer multiple of $\\pi$. We must select the branch that satisfies the given condition $\\theta(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. A convenient and continuous function that captures the correct physical behavior is the arccotangent function. From $\\tan(2\\theta) = V/(\\alpha t)$, we can write $\\cot(2\\theta) = \\alpha t/V$. This leads to:\n$$\n2\\theta(t) = \\operatorname{arccot}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha t}{V}\\right) \\implies \\theta(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{arccot}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha t}{V}\\right)\n$$\nThe principal value of $\\operatorname{arccot}(x)$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$.

The magnitude is maximized when the denominator is minimized. The term $\\alpha^2 t^2$ is non-negative, so the denominator $2(V^2 + \\alpha^2 t^2)$ has its minimum value at $t=0$.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution\nThe problem requires the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in matrix form:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\boldsymbol{\\psi}(t) = -\\mathrm{i} \\hat{H}(t) \\boldsymbol{\\psi}(t)\n$$\nwhere we have used units with $\\hbar=1$ and moved the imaginary unit $\\mathrm{i}$ to the right-hand side. The state vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1(t) \\\\ c_2(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. Standard numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers are typically designed for real-valued functions. Therefore, we must decompose the complex amplitudes $c_k(t)$ into their real and imaginary parts, $c_k(t) = x_k(t) + \\mathrm{i} y_k(t)$. This transforms the two-component complex-valued TDSE into a four-component real-valued system of first-order linear ODEs.\n\nLet the state be represented by the real vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [x_1(t), y_1(t), x_2(t), y_2(t)]^T$. The TDSE separates into real and imaginary parts as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (x_1 + \\mathrm{i}y_1) = -\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha t}{2} (x_1 + \\mathrm{i}y_1) + \\Delta (x_2 + \\mathrm{i}y_2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (x_2 + \\mathrm{i}y_2) = -\\mathrm{i} \\left( \\Delta (x_1 + \\mathrm{i}y_1) - \\frac{\\alpha t}{2} (x_2 + \\mathrm{i}y_2) \\right)\n$$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts of these two equations yields the system:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\n\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  \\alpha t/2  0  \\Delta \\\\\n-\\alpha t/2  0  -\\Delta  0 \\\\\n0  \\Delta  0  \\alpha t/2 \\\\\n-\\Delta  0  \\alpha t/2  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe initial condition $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(t_0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to $c_1(t_0)=1$ and $c_2(t_0)=0$. In our real-valued representation, this is $\\mathbf{y}(t_0) = [1, 0, 0, 0]^T$.\n\nThis system of ODEs, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(t, \\mathbf{y})$, can be integrated numerically from $t_0 = -t_{\\max}$ to $t_1 = t_{\\max}$ using an adaptive step-size algorithm, as specified. We will employ a high-order explicit Runge-Kutta method (such as the Dormand-Prince $8(5,3)$ method, `DOP853` in SciPy) with stringent absolute and relative error tolerances (e.g., $10^{-13}$) to ensure the numerical solution is accurate to near machine precision.\n\nAfter integration, the final state vector is $\\mathbf{y}(t_1) = [x_1(t_1), y_1(t_1), x_2(t_1), y_2(t_1)]^T$. The numerical probability of finding the system in the second diabatic state is then:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{num}} = |c_2(t_1)|^2 = x_2(t_1)^2 + y_2(t_1)^2\n$$\nFor comparison, we require the analytical Landau-Zener probability $P_{\\mathrm{LZ}}$ for a transition from the initial diabatic state $|1\\rangle$ to the final diabatic state $|2\\rangle$. At $t \\to -\\infty$, the system starts in state $|1\\rangle$, which is the lower energy diabatic state. For the system to follow the lower *adiabatic* energy curve, it must transition to state $|2\\rangle$ at $t \\to +\\infty$. The probability of this adiabatic following is given by $1 - P_{\\text{jump}}$, where $P_{\\text{jump}}$ is the probability of a non-adiabatic hop between the adiabatic surfaces. The Landau-Zener formula gives this jump probability as:\n$$\nP_{\\text{jump}} = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi \\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\hbar |\\alpha|}\\right)\n$$\nIn our units ($\\hbar=1$) and using the specified dimensionless parameter $\\delta = \\Delta^2/\\alpha$, this becomes $P_{\\text{jump}} = \\exp(-2\\pi \\delta)$.\nTherefore, the probability of interest, the transition to the opposite diabatic state, is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{LZ}} = P_{1 \\to 2} = 1 - P_{\\text{jump}} = 1 - \\exp(-2\\pi\\delta)\n$$\nThis is the correct analytical formula to use. The absolute error $\\varepsilon = |P_{\\mathrm{num}} - P_{\\mathrm{LZ}}|$ is then computed for each value of $\\delta$ in the test suite. The error arises from both the numerical integration and the approximation of an infinite time interval by the finite window $[-t_{\\max}, t_{\\max}]$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a two-level system\n    and compares the numerical transition probability with the analytical\n    Landau-Zener formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define problem constants as per the problem statement\n    DELTA_COUPLING = 0.5\n    S_FACTOR = 20.0\n    test_cases_delta_param = [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0]\n\n    absolute_errors = []\n\n    for delta_param in test_cases_delta_param:\n        # Calculate derived parameters for the current test case\n        # Sweep rate alpha\n        alpha = DELTA_COUPLING**2 / delta_param\n        # Integration time boundary\n        t_max = S_FACTOR * delta_param / DELTA_COUPLING\n        t_span = [-t_max, t_max]\n\n        def ode_system(t, y_vec, alpha_val, coupling_val):\n            \"\"\"\n            Defines the system of 4 real-valued first-order ODEs derived\n            from the complex-valued 2-level TDSE.\n            y_vec = [x1, y1, x2, y2] corresponds to the real and imaginary\n            parts of the amplitudes c1 and c2.\n            \"\"\"\n            x1, y1, x2, y2 = y_vec\n            \n            # Time-dependent diagonal Hamiltonian element H_11(t)\n            h11_t = alpha_val * t / 2.0\n            \n            # The system is d(y_vec)/dt = M(t) * y_vec\n            # From the derivation in the solution text:\n            # dx1/dt = (alpha*t/2)*y1 + Delta*y2\n            dx1_dt = h11_t * y1 + coupling_val * y2\n            # dy1/dt = -(alpha*t/2)*x1 - Delta*x2\n            dy1_dt = -h11_t * x1 - coupling_val * x2\n            # dx2/dt = Delta*y1 + (alpha*t/2)*y2\n            dx2_dt = coupling_val * y1 + h11_t * y2\n            # dy2/dt = -Delta*x1 + (alpha*t/2)*x2\n            dy2_dt = -coupling_val * x1 + h11_t * x2\n            \n            return [dx1_dt, dy1_dt, dx2_dt, dy2_dt]\n\n        # Initial condition: psi(t0) = [1, 0]^T, so c1(t0)=1, c2(t0)=0.\n        # This translates to y_vec(t0) = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0].\n        y0 = np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n\n        # Set tight tolerances for high-precision integration.\n        atol, rtol = 1e-13, 1e-13\n        \n        # Numerically integrate the ODE system using a high-order method.\n        # 'DOP853' is a good choice for smooth problems requiring high precision.\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            lambda t, y: ode_system(t, y, alpha, DELTA_COUPLING),\n            t_span,\n            y0,\n            method='DOP853',\n            atol=atol,\n            rtol=rtol\n        )\n\n        # Extract the state vector at the final time t_max.\n        y_final = sol.y[:, -1]\n        \n        # Calculate the numerical probability P_num = |c2(t_final)|^2.\n        p_num = y_final[2]**2 + y_final[3]**2\n        \n        # Calculate the analytical Landau-Zener probability for 1->2 transition.\n        # P_LZ = 1 - exp(-2*pi*delta), where delta is the dimensionless parameter.\n        p_lz = 1.0 - np.exp(-2.0 * np.pi * delta_param)\n\n        # Compute the absolute error between numerical and analytical results.\n        error = np.abs(p_num - p_lz)\n        absolute_errors.append(error)\n        \n    # Print the results in the specified single-line list format.\n    # The default string conversion of floats is used.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, absolute_errors))}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2678120"}]}
