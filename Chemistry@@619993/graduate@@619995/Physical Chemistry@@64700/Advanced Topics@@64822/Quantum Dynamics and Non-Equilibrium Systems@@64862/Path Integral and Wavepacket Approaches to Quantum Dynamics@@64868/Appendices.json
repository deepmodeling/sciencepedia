The core of the problem lies in analyzing the discretization error, or bias, $\\delta_{P}=\\langle V\\rangle_{P}-\\langle V\\rangle$, that arises from the second-order Trotter factorization of the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$.\n\nFirst, let us establish the theoretical foundation. The exact quantum statistical partition function is $Z = \\operatorname{Tr}(e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}})$, where $\\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}$ is the Hamiltonian, with $\\hat{T}=\\hat{p}^2/(2m)$ and $\\hat{V}=V(\\hat{x})$. The expectation value of the potential energy is $\\langle V \\rangle = \\operatorname{Tr}(\\hat{V} e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}) / Z$.\n\nIn the path integral formulation, the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ is discretized into $P$ small steps of imaginary time $\\tau = \\beta/P$. The problem specifies a second-order Trotter factorization, which is symmetric:\n$$e^{-\\tau \\hat{H}} \\approx e^{-\\tau \\hat{V}/2} e^{-\\tau \\hat{T}} e^{-\\tau \\hat{V}/2}$$\nThe approximation for the full operator is $(e^{-\\tau \\hat{V}/2} e^{-\\tau \\hat{T}} e^{-\\tau \\hat{V}/2})^P$. This defines an effective Hamiltonian for the discretized system, whose properties converge to the exact quantum system as $P \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe problem states that $\\langle V \\rangle$ is estimated by the bead-average of $V$, which is the primitive or diagonal estimator:\n$$\\langle V \\rangle_P = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{j=1}^P V(x_j) \\right\\rangle_P$$\nwhere the average $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_P$ is taken over the Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the discretized ring-polymer action derived from the second-order Trotter formula.\n\nThe error, or bias, $\\delta_P = \\langle V \\rangle_P - \\langle V \\rangle$, for an operator expectation value calculated with a finite number of beads $P$ can be derived using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion or path integral error analysis. For a general operator $\\hat{A} = A(\\hat{x})$ that depends only on position, its expectation value calculated using the primitive estimator and a second-order Trotter scheme has a leading-order error given by:\n$$\\langle A \\rangle_P - \\langle A \\rangle = -\\frac{\\beta^2 \\hbar^2}{24 m P^2} \\left\\langle \\frac{dA}{dx} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right\\rangle + O(P^{-4})$$\nIn our specific case, the operator of interest is the potential energy itself, so $\\hat{A} = \\hat{V}$. Thus, we have $A(x) = V(x)$ and $dA/dx = V'(x)$. The bias in the potential energy estimator is:\n$$\\delta_P = \\langle V \\rangle_P - \\langle V \\rangle = -\\frac{\\beta^2 \\hbar^2}{24 m P^2} \\langle (V'(x))^2 \\rangle + O(P^{-4})$$\nThis fundamental result demonstrates two key properties:\n1.  The leading error term scales with $P$ as $O(P^{-2})$.\n2.  The coefficient of the $P^{-2}$ term is negative, because $\\beta$, $\\hbar$, $m$ are positive constants, and the expectation value $\\langle (V'(x))^2 \\rangle$ must be non-negative (and is strictly positive for any non-trivial potential and physical state).\n\nThis error scaling implies that for large $P$, the expectation value can be written as an expansion in $1/P^2$:\n$$\\langle V \\rangle_P = \\langle V \\rangle_\\infty + \\frac{c_2}{P^2} + \\frac{c_4}{P^4} + \\dots$$\nwhere $\\langle V \\rangle_\\infty$ is the exact quantum value $\\langle V \\rangle$. Such a regular error expansion allows for Richardson extrapolation to accelerate convergence to the $P \\to \\infty$ limit. For an error series in powers of $P^{-2}$, a two-point extrapolation using results from simulations with $P$ and $2P$ beads is given by:\n$$A_\\infty \\approx A_{2P} + \\frac{A_{2P}-A_P}{2^n-1}$$\nwhere $n=2$ is the order of the leading error term.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For the primitive second-order Trotter factorization, the bias $\\delta_{P}=\\langle V\\rangle_{P}-\\langle V\\rangle$ scales as $O(P^{-1})$ at fixed $\\beta$. Therefore, a two-point Richardson extrapolation linear in $1/P$ with $\\langle V\\rangle_{\\infty}\\approx \\langle V\\rangle_{2P}+(\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}-\\langle V\\rangle_{P})$ is asymptotically unbiased.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. As derived, the bias for a second-order Trotter factorization scales as $O(P^{-2})$, not $O(P^{-1})$. The $O(P^{-1})$ scaling is characteristic of the first-order (primitive) Trotter factorization, $e^{-\\tau\\hat{H}} \\approx e^{-\\tau\\hat{T}}e^{-\\tau\\hat{V}}$. While the given extrapolation formula is correct for an $O(P^{-1})$ error, the premise of the scaling is wrong for the specified method.\n\n**B. For the primitive second-order Trotter factorization, the bias $\\delta_{P}=\\langle V\\rangle_{P}-\\langle V\\rangle$ scales as $O(P^{-2})$ at fixed $\\beta$. Therefore, a two-point Richardson extrapolation linear in $1/P^{2}$ with\n$\\langle V\\rangle_{\\infty}\\approx \\langle V\\rangle_{2P}+\\frac{\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}-\\langle V\\rangle_{P}}{2^{2}-1}=\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}+\\frac{\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}-\\langle V\\rangle_{P}}{3}$ is asymptotically unbiased.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. The scaling of the bias is indeed $O(P^{-2})$, as we have shown. The Richardson extrapolation formula for an error of order $n=2$ is $\\langle V \\rangle_\\infty \\approx \\langle V \\rangle_{2P} + (\\langle V \\rangle_{2P} - \\langle V \\rangle_{P})/(2^2-1)$, which simplifies to the expression given. Both the error scaling and the extrapolation formula are correct.\n\n**C. For any convex anharmonic potential $V(x)$, the coefficient of the leading bias term in $\\langle V\\rangle_{P}$ is universally positive, implying $\\langle V\\rangle_{P}\\ge \\langle V\\rangle$ for all $P$, so $\\langle V\\rangle_{P}$ is a monotone decreasing sequence in $P$ and no extrapolation is necessary.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The coefficient of the leading bias term is proportional to $-\\langle (V'(x))^2 \\rangle$. Since $\\langle (V'(x))^2 \\rangle > 0$, the coefficient is universally *negative*. This implies that for large $P$, $\\langle V \\rangle_P \\le \\langle V \\rangle$, and the sequence $\\langle V\\rangle_P$ approaches the exact result from below, i.e., it is a monotone *increasing* sequence in $P$. Furthermore, even if it were a monotonic sequence, extrapolation is a highly valuable and standard technique to obtain a more accurate estimate of the $P\\to\\infty$ limit from finite-$P$ calculations.\n\n**D. If one employs the Takahashi–Imada (TI) higher-order factorization, i.e., samples with an effective potential that incorporates the commutator correction based on $[V,[T,V]]$, and uses a consistent diagonal estimator for $V$, then the leading bias in $\\langle V\\rangle_{P}$ scales as $O(P^{-4})$ at fixed $\\beta$. Consequently, a two-point Richardson extrapolation linear in $1/P^{4}$ with\n$\\langle V\\rangle_{\\infty}\\approx \\langle V\\rangle_{2P}+\\frac{\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}-\\langle V\\rangle_{P}}{2^{4}-1}=\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}+\\frac{\\langle V\\rangle_{2P}-\\langle V\\rangle_{P}}{15}$ is asymptotically unbiased and more efficient.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. The Takahashi-Imada factorization is a well-known higher-order method specifically designed to eliminate the $O(P^{-2})$ error term from the path integral. It achieves this by introducing a modified potential that includes corrections proportional to $(V'(x))^2$. When sampling from the distribution generated by this modified potential and using a consistent estimator for the original potential energy, the error in the expectation value indeed scales as $O(P^{-4})$. The corresponding Richardson extrapolation formula for an error of order $n=4$ requires a denominator of $2^4-1=15$, which matches the formula provided. This faster convergence rate makes the calculation significantly more efficient, as higher accuracy can be reached with smaller $P$.\n\n**E. Using the centroid virial estimator for the potential energy eliminates all Trotter discretization bias for any anharmonic potential, yielding $\\langle V\\rangle_{P}=\\langle V\\rangle$ for any finite $P$.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. This claim is far too strong. While certain estimators for certain observables in a *harmonic* potential can be free of discretization error (because the harmonic oscillator path integral can be solved exactly), this does not hold for a general *anharmonic* potential, such as the one given. The Trotter discretization is an approximation, and for general potentials, a finite-$P$ calculation will always have a residual error that vanishes only in the limit $P \\to \\infty$. No known estimator for the potential energy can eliminate this error for *any* anharmonic potential at finite $P$.

The final numerical answers are unitless floats.\n\nYour program must implement the following fully specified simulation design, which is universally applicable and defined purely in mathematical terms:\n\n- Spatial domain and grid:\n  - Domain $x \\in [0,L_x)$ with periodic boundary conditions implicit in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n  - Length $L_x = 200$.\n  - Number of grid points $N = 2048$.\n  - Grid spacing $\\Delta x = L_x/N$.\n  - Discrete grid $x_j = j\\Delta x$ for $j=0,1,\\dots,N-1$.\n\n- Momentum grid for FFT-based kinetic propagation:\n  - Wave numbers $k_n = \\frac{2\\pi}{L_x}n$ where $n$ are the integer FFT frequencies consistent with spacing $\\Delta x$.\n\n- Time discretization:\n  - Total propagation time $T = 150$.\n  - Time step $\\Delta t = 0.05$.\n  - Number of steps $M = T/\\Delta t$.\n\n- Initial state (normalized Gaussian wavepacket):\n  - Center $x_0 = 50$.\n  - Width $\\sigma = 4$.\n  - Central wave number $k_0 > 0$ (varies per test case).\n  - Wavefunction\n    $$\n    \\psi(x,0) \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\right)^{1/4}\\,\\exp\\left[-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right]\\exp\\left(i\\,k_0\\,(x-x_0)\\right),\n    $$\n    followed by numerical renormalization to ensure $\\int |\\psi(x,0)|^2\\,dx = 1$ on the discrete grid.\n\n- Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP) near the right boundary:\n  - CAP onset location $x_a = 150$.\n  - CAP length $L_{\\mathrm{cap}} = L_x - x_a = 50$.\n  - Polynomial CAP profile of order $m = 2$:\n    $$\n    \\eta(x) \\;=\\; \\begin{cases}\n      0, & x < x_a,\\\\[6pt]\n      \\eta_0 \\left(\\dfrac{x - x_a}{L_{\\mathrm{cap}}}\\right)^{m}, & x \\ge x_a,\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    with strength parameter $\\eta_0 > 0$ (varies per test case).\n\n- Time propagation by the second-order split-operator (Strang) scheme at each time step:\n  1. Half-step potential propagation: $\\psi(x) \\leftarrow \\exp(-iV(x)\\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\\psi(x)$.\n  2. Full-step kinetic propagation in momentum space:\n     - Forward FFT to $\\tilde{\\psi}(k)$,\n     - Multiply by $\\exp(-i\\frac{k^2}{2}\\Delta t)$,\n     - Inverse FFT to $\\psi(x)$.\n  3. Half-step potential propagation: $\\psi(x) \\leftarrow \\exp(-iV(x)\\frac{\\Delta t}{2})\\psi(x)$.\n  Since $V(x)=-i\\eta(x)$, the potential propagator is a real exponential decay factor $\\exp(-\\eta(x)\\frac{\\Delta t}{2})$.\n\n- Flux measurement and reflection coefficient:\n  - Choose a monitor point $x_m = 100$, strictly to the left of the CAP region, and define the discrete index $j_m$ corresponding to $x_m$.\n  - Compute the discrete current at $x_m$:\n    $$\n    j(x_m,t) \\;\\approx\\; \\mathrm{Im}\\!\\left[ \\psi^*(x_m,t)\\,\\frac{\\psi(x_{m+1},t)-\\psi(x_{m-1},t)}{2\\,\\Delta x} \\right],\n    $$\n    which equals $j$ in atomic units since $\\hbar/m=1$.\n  - At each time step, accumulate\n    $$\n    J_{+} \\;+=\\; \\max\\!\\big( j(x_m,t),\\,0 \\big)\\,\\Delta t,\\qquad\n    J_{-} \\;+=\\; \\max\\!\\big( -j(x_m,t),\\,0 \\big)\\,\\Delta t.\n    $$\n    The incident probability crossing $x_m$ is $J_{+}$ and the reflected probability crossing $x_m$ is $J_{-}$.\n  - The reflection coefficient is\n    $$\n    R \\;=\\; \\frac{J_{-}}{J_{+}}\\,.\n    $$\n\nYour program must evaluate the reflection coefficient for the following test suite, which explores dependence on the CAP strength $\\eta_0$ and incident energy $E=k_0^2/2$:\n- Case 1: $k_0 = 1.5$, $\\eta_0 = 0.05$.\n- Case 2: $k_0 = 1.5$, $\\eta_0 = 0.20$.\n- Case 3: $k_0 = 1.5$, $\\eta_0 = 0.50$.\n- Case 4: $k_0 = 2.5$, $\\eta_0 = 0.05$.\n- Case 5: $k_0 = 2.5$, $\\eta_0 = 0.20$.\n- Case 6: $k_0 = 2.5$, $\\eta_0 = 0.50$.\n\nFinal output specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the 6 reflection coefficients in the order of the cases above, each rounded to 6 decimal places, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, `[...]`).", "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed numerical experiment in one-dimensional quantum dynamics. It is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and provides a complete specification for its solution. Therefore, a rigorous solution is warranted.\n\nThe objective is to compute the reflection coefficient, $R$, for a quantum wavepacket scattering from a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP). This will be accomplished by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) and analyzing the probability current density. All calculations are performed in atomic units, where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ and the particle mass $m$ are set to $\\hbar=1$ and $m=1$.\n\nThe governing equation is the TDSE:\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H}\\psi(x,t) = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V(x) \\right] \\psi(x,t)\n$$\nHere, $\\hat{H} = \\hat{K} + \\hat{V}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, composed of the kinetic energy operator $\\hat{K} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ and the potential energy operator $\\hat{V} = V(x)$. The potential is a purely imaginary CAP, $V(x) = -i\\eta(x)$, which makes the Hamiltonian non-Hermitian and causes the norm of the wavefunction, $\\int |\\psi(x,t)|^2 dx$, to decrease over time.\n\nThe numerical solution is implemented based on the provided specifications.\n\n**1. Discretization of Space and Momentum**\n\nThe continuous spatial domain $x \\in [0, L_x)$ is discretized into a uniform grid of $N=2048$ points. The domain length is $L_x = 200$. The grid points are $x_j = j \\Delta x$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L_x / N$. The wavefunction $\\psi(x,t)$ is represented by its values on this grid, $\\psi_j(t) = \\psi(x_j, t)$.\n\nThe kinetic energy operator is most conveniently evaluated in momentum space. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to switch between the spatial representation and the momentum (wave number) representation. The corresponding discrete wave numbers, consistent with the spatial grid and periodic boundary conditions, are given by $k_n = \\frac{2\\pi}{L_x} n$, where $n$ represents the integer frequencies managed by the FFT algorithm.\n\n**2. Initial State Preparation**\n\nThe initial state at $t=0$ is a right-moving Gaussian wavepacket centered at $x_0=50$ with an initial momentum $k_0$. Its analytical form is:\n$$\n\\psi(x,0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right] \\exp\\left(i k_0 (x-x_0)\\right)\n$$\nwhere the width is $\\sigma=4$. After evaluating this function on the discrete grid, it is numerically renormalized to ensure that the total probability is unity on the discrete domain:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} |\\psi_j(0)|^2 \\Delta x = 1\n$$\nThis is achieved by dividing the wavefunction array by the square root of the computed sum, i.e., $\\psi \\leftarrow \\psi / \\sqrt{\\sum |\\psi_j|^2 \\Delta x}$.\n\n**3. Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP)**\n\nA polynomial CAP of order $m=2$ is placed at the right end of the grid to absorb the outgoing wavepacket and prevent unphysical reflections from the periodic boundary. The potential is non-zero only for $x \\ge x_a = 150$. Its functional form is:\n$$\n\\eta(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    0, & x < x_a \\\\\n    \\eta_0 \\left(\\dfrac{x - x_a}{L_{\\mathrm{cap}}}\\right)^{m}, & x \\ge x_a\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $L_{\\mathrm{cap}} = L_x-x_a = 50$ is the length of the CAP region and $\\eta_0$ is the strength parameter which varies between test cases. The full potential is $V(x) = -i\\eta(x)$.\n\n**4. Time Evolution via the Split-Operator Method**\n\nThe formal solution to the TDSE is $\\psi(t+\\Delta t) = \\exp(-i \\hat{H} \\Delta t) \\psi(t)$. Since the kinetic ($\\hat{K}$) and potential ($\\hat{V}$) operators do not commute, the exponential of their sum cannot be separated into a product of exponentials directly. The second-order split-operator method, a form of Strang splitting, approximates the time-evolution operator for a single step $\\Delta t$ as:\n$$\n\\exp(-i(\\hat{K}+\\hat{V})\\Delta t) \\approx \\exp\\left(-i\\hat{V}\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\exp(-i\\hat{K}\\Delta t) \\exp\\left(-i\\hat{V}\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nThe propagation from time $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ is performed in three steps:\na. **Half potential step:** The wavefunction is multiplied by the potential propagator in position space. Since $V(x) = -i\\eta(x)$, the propagator is a real-valued decaying exponential:\n   $$\n   \\psi(x, t+\\Delta t/2) = \\exp\\left(-i V(x) \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\psi(x,t) = \\exp\\left(-\\eta(x)\\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right) \\psi(x,t)\n   $$\nb. **Full kinetic step:** The action of the kinetic operator is a simple multiplication in momentum space. The algorithm performs a forward FFT, multiplies by the kinetic propagator, and then performs an inverse FFT:\n   - $\\tilde{\\psi}(k) = \\mathcal{F}[\\psi(x)]$\n   - $\\tilde{\\psi}(k) \\leftarrow \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{k^2}{2} \\Delta t\\right) \\tilde{\\psi}(k)$\n   - $\\psi(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\tilde{\\psi}(k)]$\nc. **Second half potential step:** This step is identical to the first, acting on the result of the kinetic step.\n\nThis sequence is repeated for a total of $M = T/\\Delta t = 150/0.05 = 3000$ steps to cover the total propagation time $T=150$.\n\n**5. Flux Calculation and Reflection Coefficient**\n\nThe reflection coefficient $R$ is the ratio of the total reflected probability to the total incident probability. These probabilities are calculated by time-integrating the probability current density $j(x,t)$ at a fixed monitor point $x_m = 100$, located between the initial wavepacket position and the CAP region. The definition of current density is:\n$$\nj(x,t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\mathrm{Im}\\left[ \\psi^*(x,t) \\frac{\\partial\\psi(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right] = \\mathrm{Im}\\left[ \\psi^*(x,t) \\frac{\\partial\\psi(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right]\n$$\nOn the discrete grid, the spatial derivative at $x_m=x_{j_m}$ is approximated using a second-order central difference formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\psi(x_m,t)}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{\\psi(x_{m+1},t) - \\psi(x_{m-1},t)}{2 \\Delta x} = \\frac{\\psi_{j_m+1}(t) - \\psi_{j_m-1}(t)}{2 \\Delta x}\n$$\nThe discrete current at time $t$ is thus:\n$$\nj(x_m,t) \\approx \\mathrm{Im}\\left[ \\psi_{j_m}^*(t) \\frac{\\psi_{j_m+1}(t) - \\psi_{j_m-1}(t)}{2 \\Delta x} \\right]\n$$\nAt each time step, the current value is calculated. A positive value ($j>0$) corresponds to the incident wavepacket moving to the right, while a negative value ($j<0$) corresponds to the reflected wavepacket moving to the left. The time-integrated incident ($J_+$) and reflected ($J_-$) fluxes are accumulated as follows:\n$$\nJ_+ = \\int_0^T \\max(j(x_m,t), 0) dt \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\max(j(x_m, t_i), 0) \\Delta t\n$$\n$$\nJ_- = \\int_0^T \\max(-j(x_m,t), 0) dt \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\max(-j(x_m, t_i), 0) \\Delta t\n$$\nFinally, the reflection coefficient is computed as the ratio of these accumulated fluxes:\n$$\nR = \\frac{J_-}{J_+}\n$$\nThis procedure is applied to each of the six test cases specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a wavepacket scattering\n    off a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP) and calculates the reflection\n    coefficient for several test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Simulation parameters ---\n    L_x = 200.0  # Spatial domain length\n    N = 2048     # Number of grid points\n    dx = L_x / N # Grid spacing\n    x = np.arange(N) * dx # Spatial grid\n\n    T = 150.0    # Total propagation time\n    dt = 0.05    # Time step\n    num_steps = int(T / dt) # Number of time steps\n\n    # --- Initial state parameters ---\n    x0 = 50.0    # Initial center of wavepacket\n    sigma = 4.0  # Initial width of wavepacket\n\n    # --- CAP parameters ---\n    x_a = 150.0  # CAP onset location\n    L_cap = L_x - x_a # CAP length\n    m_cap = 2    # CAP polynomial order\n\n    # --- Flux measurement parameters ---\n    x_m = 100.0  # Monitor point location\n    # The monitor point is exactly on a grid point.\n    j_m = int(round(x_m / dx))\n\n    # --- Momentum grid and Kinetic Propagator ---\n    # Create the momentum grid corresponding to the FFT frequencies.\n    k = 2 * np.pi * np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=dx)\n    \n    # The kinetic propagator is constant in time.\n    # K_prop = exp(-i * K * dt) = exp(-i * (k^2/2) * dt)\n    K_prop = np.exp(-0.5j * k**2 * dt)\n\n    def run_simulation(k0, eta0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Runs a single simulation for a given initial momentum k0 and CAP strength eta0.\n        \n        Args:\n            k0 (float): Central wave number of the initial wavepacket.\n            eta0 (float): Strength parameter of the CAP.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The calculated reflection coefficient R.\n        \"\"\"\n        \n        # 1.
