The fundamental principle connecting the response of a system to an external field with its internal equilibrium fluctuations is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT).

The precise prefactor is a dimensionless number arising from the cubic lattice sum. Defining this number as $\\xi$, one obtains the leading finite-size correction\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu(L) \\;=\\; -\\,\\frac{\\xi}{6\\pi \\eta L} \\;+\\; \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{L^{3}}\\right).\n$$\nThe sign is negative because the periodic images hinder the flow, reducing the self-mobility compared to the infinite system. The $\\mathcal{O}(L^{-3})$ term comes from higher-order finite-size corrections that depend on tracer size and higher multipole hydrodynamics (for a sphere of radius $a$, the next term scales as $a^{2}/(\\eta L^{3})$).\n\nUsing the Einstein relation $D = k_{B} T \\,\\mu$, the finite-size corrected diffusion coefficient is\n$$\nD(L) \\;=\\; k_{B} T \\,\\mu(L) \\;=\\; k_{B} T \\left[ \\mu(\\infty) + \\Delta \\mu(L) \\right] \\;=\\; D(\\infty) \\;-\\; \\frac{\\xi \\, k_{B} T}{6\\pi \\eta L} \\;+\\; \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{L^{3}}\\right).\n$$\nThus, the requested leading-order expression is\n$$\nD(L) \\;=\\; D(\\infty) \\;-\\; \\frac{\\xi \\, k_{B} T}{6\\pi \\eta L}.\n$$\n\nAssumptions and range of validity: \n- The liquid is an incompressible Newtonian fluid with constant shear viscosity $\\eta$, and inertial effects are negligible (Stokes regime).\n- Linear response holds, and the Fluctuation–Dissipation Theorem applies so that $D = k_{B} T \\,\\mu$ at zero frequency.\n- Hydrodynamics at the scales comparable to $L$ is well described by continuum Stokes equations; the tracer size $a$ satisfies $a \\ll L$, ensuring that higher-order corrections are small.\n- The periodic boundary conditions conserve total momentum (no external momentum sink other than implicit periodicity), so that the hydrodynamic long-wavelength spectrum is discretized only by the box.\n- The leading correction is universal and geometry dependent only through the dimensionless constant $\\xi$ for the cubic lattice; the next non-vanishing correction is of order $L^{-3}$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the leading finite-size correction to the self-diffusion coefficient is given by the expression above, with $\\xi$ a dimensionless constant determined by the cubic lattice summation of the Oseen tensor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D(\\infty)\\;-\\;\\frac{\\xi\\,k_{B}T}{6\\pi\\,\\eta\\,L}}$$", "id": "2674563"}]}
