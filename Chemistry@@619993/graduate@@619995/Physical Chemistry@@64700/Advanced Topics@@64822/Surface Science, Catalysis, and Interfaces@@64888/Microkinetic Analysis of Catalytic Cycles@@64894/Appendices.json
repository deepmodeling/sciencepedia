It will be solved by first deriving the general expressions for surface coverages under the specified conditions, and then by substituting the provided numerical values to find the specific coverage of species $A$.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following physical assumptions, which constitute the Langmuir model for competitive adsorption:\n$1$. The gas phase containing species $A$, $B$, and $I$ behaves as an ideal-gas mixture.\n$2$. The catalytic surface is uniform, meaning it possesses a fixed number of identical, energetically equivalent adsorption sites. Let the total concentration of sites be $C_{total}$.\n$3$. Adsorption is non-dissociative and restricted to a monolayer. Each site can be occupied by at most one molecule.\n$4$. There are no lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules. The enthalpy of adsorption for a given species is independent of the coverage of other species.\n$5$. The system is isothermal. All rate and equilibrium constants are constant.\n$6$. The adsorption-desorption processes for all species are elementary and reversible. They are assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium, meaning their net rates are negligible compared to the rates of any subsequent, slower surface reactions.

The problem states that $I$ is a short-lived intermediate and that a quasi-steady regime exists. This approximation implies that the rate of change of the concentration of the intermediate is negligible compared to the rates of change of the reactant and product concentrations.
