A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts as requested: derivation, calculation, interpretation, and final averaging.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Relation**\nThe condition for thermodynamic equilibrium for adsorption is the equality of the chemical potential of the gas species in the gas phase, $\\mu_g$, and in the adsorbed phase, $\\mu_a$:\n$$ \\mu_g(T, P) = \\mu_a(T, \\theta) $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $P$ is the gas pressure, and $\\theta$ is the fractional surface coverage. For any change that maintains equilibrium, the differentials must be equal: $d\\mu_g = d\\mu_a$. It is more rigorous to work with the chemical potentials divided by temperature. At equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_g(T, P)}{T} = \\frac{\\mu_a(T, \\theta)}{T} $$\nWe are interested in the relationship between $P$ and $T$ at constant coverage $\\theta$. We differentiate the above equation with respect to $T$ while holding $\\theta$ constant. Note that $P$ is implicitly a function of $T$ along an isostere (a line of constant $\\theta$).\n$$ \\left( \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{\\theta} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_a}{T} \\right) \\right)_{\\theta} $$\nThe left-hand side is a total derivative with respect to $T$ at constant $\\theta$. We apply the chain rule, recognizing that $\\mu_g$ is a function of $T$ and $P$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{P} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{T} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_a}{T} \\right) \\right)_{\\theta} $$\nWe now evaluate each term. The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation states that $\\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = -\\frac{H_m}{T^2}$, where $H_m$ is the molar enthalpy. Applying this to the gas and adsorbed phases:\n- For the gas phase: $\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu_g/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = -\\frac{H_g}{T^2}$, where $H_g$ is the molar enthalpy of the gas.\n- For the adsorbed phase: We define the differential molar enthalpy of the adsorbate as $H_a$, such that $\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu_a/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{H_a}{T^2}$.\n\nFor the term involving the pressure derivative, we use the expression for the chemical potential of an ideal gas: $\\mu_g(T, P) = \\mu_g^\\circ(T) + RT \\ln(P/P^\\circ)$, where $P^\\circ$ is a standard pressure.\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} = \\frac{\\mu_g^\\circ(T)}{T} + R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P}{P^\\circ}\\right) $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $P$ at constant $T$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{T} = \\frac{R}{P} $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the central equation:\n$$ -\\frac{H_g}{T^2} + \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{H_a}{T^2} $$\nRearranging to solve for the pressure-temperature relationship:\n$$ \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{H_g - H_a}{T^2} $$\nThe isosteric heat of adsorption, $q_{st}$, is defined as the heat evolved when one mole of gas adsorbs onto the surface at constant coverage. For an exothermic process like physisorption, $q_{st}$ is positive. It is defined as the negative of the differential enthalpy of adsorption: $q_{st} = -\\Delta H_{ads} = -(H_a - H_g) = H_g - H_a$.\nSubstituting $q_{st}$ into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{q_{st}}{T^2} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged for easier integration by noting that $\\frac{1}{P} \\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{d\\ln P}{dT}$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{q_{st}}{RT^2} $$\nFinally, using the transformation $d(1/T) = -1/T^2 \\, dT$, we arrive at the desired relation, an analogue of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial (1/T)} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{q_{st}}{R} $$\nThis equation relates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium pressure at constant coverage to the isosteric heat of adsorption.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $q_{st}(\\theta)$**\nThe derived relation can be approximated using a two-point finite difference method for the derivative, assuming $q_{st}$ is constant over the small temperature interval $[T_1, T_2]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(P_2) - \\ln(P_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} \\approx -\\frac{q_{st}(\\theta)}{R} $$\nwhere $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the equilibrium pressures at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ for a given coverage $\\theta$.\nSolving for $q_{st}(\\theta)$:\n$$ q_{st}(\\theta) \\approx -R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} $$\nGiven $T_1 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_2 = 320\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the denominator is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{320} - \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{300 - 320}{300 \\times 320} = \\frac{-20}{96000} = -\\frac{1}{4800}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $q_{st}(\\theta)$:\n$$ q_{st}(\\theta) \\approx -R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{-1/4800} = 4800 R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right) $$\nUsing $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, we can now calculate $q_{st}$ for each value of $\\theta$:\n\n- For $\\theta=0.05$: $P_1 = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.122\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.05) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.122}{0.080}\\right) \\approx 16841.80\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.10$: $P_1 = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.230\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.10) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.230}{0.150}\\right) \\approx 17058.08\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.20$: $P_1 = 0.320\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.520\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.20) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.520}{0.320}\\right) \\approx 19375.46\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.30$: $P_1 = 0.600\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 1.050\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.30) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.050}{0.600}\\right) \\approx 22332.86\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Trend of $q_{st}(\\theta)$**\nThe calculated values of the isosteric heat of adsorption are approximately $16.8\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $17.1\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $19.4\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $22.3\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ for coverages of $0.05$, $0.10$, $0.20$, and $0.30$, respectively. It is observed that $q_{st}$ increases as the surface coverage $\\theta$ increases. This trend provides insight into the nature of the adsorption system. Two primary factors influence the coverage dependence of $q_{st}$: energetic heterogeneity of the surface and lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules.\n\n1.  **Energetic Heterogeneity**: If the adsorbent surface were energetically heterogeneous, it would possess a distribution of adsorption sites with varying adsorption energies. Adsorption would preferentially occur on the highest-energy sites first (those with the largest $q_{st}$). As coverage increases, molecules are forced to occupy lower-energy sites, which would result in a *decrease* of the measured $q_{st}$ with increasing $\\theta$. This is contrary to the observed trend.\n\n2.  **Lateral Interactions**: If the surface is energetically homogeneous, the change in $q_{st}$ must be due to interactions between adjacent adsorbed molecules (adsorbates).\n    - If these interactions are repulsive, an incoming molecule would be destabilized by its neighbors. This would make adsorption less favorable at higher coverages, causing $q_{st}$ to *decrease* with increasing $\\theta$.\n    - If these interactions are attractive, an incoming molecule would be stabilized by its neighbors. This cooperative effect enhances the overall binding energy, making adsorption more favorable at higher coverages. Consequently, the energy required to remove a molecule from the surface increases, leading to an *increase* of $q_{st}$ with increasing $\\theta$.\n\nSince the experimental data show a clear increase in $q_{st}$ with $\\theta$, the dominant phenomenon is attractive lateral interactions between the adsorbed gas molecules on the surface of the nonporous oxide.\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of the Mean Isosteric Heat of Adsorption**\nThe arithmetic mean of the four calculated $q_{st}$ values is:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( q_{st}(0.05) + q_{st}(0.10) + q_{st}(0.20) + q_{st}(0.30) \\right) $$\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 16841.80 + 17058.08 + 19375.46 + 22332.86 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 75608.20 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 18902.05 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = 18.90205 \\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} \\approx 18.90 \\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{18.90} $$", "id": "2467809"}]}
