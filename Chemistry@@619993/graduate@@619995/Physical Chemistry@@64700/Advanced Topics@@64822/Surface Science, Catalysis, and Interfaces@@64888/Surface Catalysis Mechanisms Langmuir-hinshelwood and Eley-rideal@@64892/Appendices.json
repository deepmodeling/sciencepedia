Consider an isothermal surface at temperature $T$, in contact with a dilute ideal gas mixture in which the partial pressure of $A$ is $P_A$ and the molecular mass of $A$ is $m_A$. From kinetic theory of gases, the impingement rate of $A$ onto a unit surface area is given by $Z_A = P_A/\\sqrt{2\\pi m_A k_B T}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Let $s_A$ denote the sticking probability (sticking coefficient), defined as the probability that an impinging $A$ adsorbs upon collision with an empty site. Let $N_s$ denote the surface site density (number of sites per unit area), and let $\\nu_{\\text{des}}$ be the intrinsic first-order desorption frequency (per occupied site) for $A$.\n\nUnder these definitions, the adsorption rate per unit area is $r_{\\text{ads}} = s_A Z_A (1-\\theta_A)$ and the desorption rate per unit area is $r_{\\text{des}} = (\\nu_{\\text{des}} N_s)\\theta_A$, where $\\theta_A$ is the fractional coverage by $A$. At quasi-equilibrium for the adsorption–desorption step, detailed balance implies $r_{\\text{ads}} = r_{\\text{des}}$, which yields a Langmuir adsorption isotherm of the form $\\theta_A/(1-\\theta_A) = K_A P_A$, where $K_A$ is the adsorption equilibrium constant.

We are to express the dimensions of these quantities in terms of the base SI units of mass ($\\mathrm{kg}$), length ($\\mathrm{m}$), and time ($\\mathrm{s}$). We represent mass by the dimension $M$, length by $L$, and time by $T$.\n\nFirst, we establish the dimensions of the known quantities. The adsorption equilibrium constant $K_A$ is stated to have dimensions of inverse pressure, $[\\mathrm{Pressure}]^{-1}$. The SI unit of pressure is the Pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), which is a newton per square meter ($\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2$). The dimension of force (newton) is $M L T^{-2}$.\nTherefore, the dimension of pressure is:\n$$\n[P] = \\frac{[\\text{Force}]}{[\\text{Area}]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}\n$$\nThe dimension of $K_A$ is the inverse of this:\n$$\n[K_A] = [P]^{-1} = (M L^{-1} T^{-2})^{-1} = M^{-1} L^{1} T^{2}\n$$\n\nWith this foundation, we analyze each quantity individually based on the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Dimensional analysis of $s_A$**:\n    The quantity $s_A$ is defined as the sticking probability or sticking coefficient. A probability is a dimensionless ratio, representing the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, $s_A$ is a pure number and has no physical dimensions.\n    $$\n    [s_A] = 1 = M^0 L^0 T^0\n    $$\n    The corresponding exponents $(a,b,c)$ are $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Dimensional analysis of $J_A$**:\n    The quantity $J_A$ is defined as the ratio of the impingement rate $Z_A$ to the partial pressure $P_A$, i.e., $J_A \\equiv Z_A/P_A$.\n    The impingement rate $Z_A$ is defined as the number of molecules striking a unit surface area per unit time. The dimension of 'number of molecules' is $1$ (dimensionless). Thus, the dimensions of $Z_A$ are:\n    $$\n    [Z_A] = \\frac{[\\text{Number}]}{[\\text{Area}] \\cdot [\\text{Time}]} = \\frac{1}{L^2 T} = L^{-2} T^{-1}\n    $$\n    We can verify this using the provided formula from kinetic theory, $Z_A = P_A/\\sqrt{2\\pi m_A k_B T}$.

Now, we can find the dimension of $J_A$:\n    $$\n    [J_A] = \\frac{[Z_A]}{[P_A]} = \\frac{L^{-2} T^{-1}}{M L^{-1} T^{-2}} = M^{-1} L^{-2 - (-1)} T^{-1 - (-2)} = M^{-1} L^{-1} T^{1}\n    $$\n    The corresponding exponents $(a,b,c)$ are $(-1, -1, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Dimensional analysis of $k_{\\text{des}}$**:\n    The quantity $k_{\\text{des}}$ is defined as the product of the desorption frequency $\\nu_{\\text{des}}$ and the surface site density $N_s$, i.e., $k_{\\text{des}} \\equiv \\nu_{\\text{des}} N_s$.\n    The quantity $\\nu_{\\text{des}}$ is a first-order frequency, which has units of inverse time. The qualifier \"per occupied site\" refers to the basis of the rate, but 'site' is a dimensionless count.\n    $$\n    [\\nu_{\\text{des}}] = T^{-1}\n    $$\n    The quantity $N_s$ is the surface site density, defined as the number of sites per unit area.\n    $$\n    [N_s] = \\frac{[\\text{Number of sites}]}{[\\text{Area}]} = \\frac{1}{L^2} = L^{-2}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the dimension of $k_{\\text{des}}$ is:\n    $$\n    [k_{\\text{des}}] = [\\nu_{\\text{des}}] [N_s] = (T^{-1}) (L^{-2}) = M^0 L^{-2} T^{-1}\n    $$\n    The corresponding exponents $(a,b,c)$ are $(0, -2, -1)$.\n\nFinally, we verify that these dimensions result in the correct dimension for $K_A$:\n$$\n[K_A] = \\frac{[s_A][J_A]}{[k_{\\text{des}}]} = \\frac{(M^0 L^0 T^0) \\cdot (M^{-1} L^{-1} T^{1})}{(M^0 L^{-2} T^{-1})} = M^{-1} L^{-1 - (-2)} T^{1 - (-1)} = M^{-1} L^{1} T^{2}\n$$\nThis result is identical to the dimension of inverse pressure, $M^{-1} L^{1} T^{2}$, which confirms the correctness of our analysis.\n\nThe required output is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix of the exponents $(a,b,c)$ for the dimensions $\\mathrm{kg}^a\\,\\mathrm{m}^b\\,\\mathrm{s}^c$ for $s_A$, $J_A$, and $k_{\\text{des}}$, respectively.\nRow 1 ($s_A$): $(a,b,c) = (0, 0, 0)$\nRow 2 ($J_A$): $(a,b,c) = (-1, -1, 1)$\nRow 3 ($k_{\\text{des}}$): $(a,b,c) = (0, -2, -1)$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2669647"}, {"introduction": "With a solid grasp of the individual kinetic parameters, we can now assemble them to describe a complete catalytic cycle.

This will be approached from first principles.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem statement is confirmed. The problem describes a canonical Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, a standard and scientifically grounded topic in physical chemistry. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is well-posed and solvable.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by its slowest, rate-determining step (RDS). In this case, the RDS is the surface reaction between an adsorbed species $A*$ and an adsorbed species $B*$:\n$$A* + B* \\xrightarrow{k} \\text{products} + 2*$$\nThe rate of this elementary step is proportional to the surface concentrations of the reactants, $A*$ and $B*$. It is conventional in surface kinetics to express rates in terms of fractional surface coverages, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$.

The Langmuir model for competitive adsorption applies. For the adsorption of species $A$ and $B$ on vacant sites $*$:\n$$ A(\\text{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A* $$\n$$ B(\\text{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons B* $$\nThe corresponding equilibrium relationships are:\n$$ K_A = \\frac{[A*]}{[A(\\text{g})][*]} = \\frac{\\theta_A}{P_A \\theta_v} $$\n$$ K_B = \\frac{[B*]}{[B(\\text{g})][*]} = \\frac{\\theta_B}{P_B \\theta_v} $$\nwhere $\\theta_v$ is the fraction of vacant sites, and the partial pressures $P_A$ and $P_B$ are used for the gas-phase concentrations, assuming ideal gas behavior. From these equations, we express the coverages of $A$ and $B$ in terms of the vacant site coverage:\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A P_A \\theta_v $$\n$$ \\theta_B = K_B P_B \\theta_v $$\nThe total number of sites is conserved.

An intrinsic property is one that depends only on the nature of the catalyst material and temperature, not on transport phenomena or reactor conditions. The key assumptions are:\n\n1.  **Validity of the Langmuirian Surface Model**: The catalytic surface is energetically uniform, meaning all active sites are identical. Adsorbed molecules do not exhibit lateral interactions, so the heat of adsorption is independent of coverage. Adsorption is limited to a monolayer.\n2.  **Correctness of the Kinetic Mechanism**: The proposed sequence of elementary steps (competitive adsorption of $A$ and $B$, surface reaction as the sole RDS, and rapid, irreversible product formation and desorption) accurately represents the true reaction pathway.\n3.  **Absence of Transport Limitations**: The reaction rate is controlled by the intrinsic kinetics of the surface chemical reaction, not by the rate of mass or heat transport. This implies:\n    a. No **external mass transfer limitations**: The transport of reactants from the bulk gas phase to the external surface of the catalyst is very fast compared to the reaction rate.\n    b. No **internal mass transfer limitations**: If the catalyst is porous, the diffusion of reactants within the pores is very fast compared to the reaction rate.\n    c. No **heat transfer limitations**: The reaction is conducted under isothermal conditions, with any heat generated or consumed by the reaction being dissipated rapidly, preventing temperature gradients across the catalyst particle or reactor bed.\n4.  **Catalyst Stability**: The structure, composition, and number of active sites of the catalyst remain constant throughout the measurement.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the measured rate reflects the true chemical kinetics at the active site, and the calculated TOF represents an intrinsic measure of catalytic activity under the specified temperature and partial pressures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8570}$$", "id": "2669659"}, {"introduction": "A derived rate law is not static; its behavior can shift dramatically with changing conditions, revealing different rate-limiting steps.

The rate is proportional to $k_r$, signifying that the surface reaction is the kinetic bottleneck.\n2.  **Adsorption-limited regime**: This occurs when the surface reaction is much faster than desorption, i.e., $k_r \\gg k_d$. Any molecule that successfully adsorbs is quickly converted to product. The denominator is dominated by $k_r$, and the overall rate becomes:\n    $$\n    Rate \\approx \\frac{k_a k_r P_A}{k_r} = k_a P_A\n    $$\n    The rate is limited by the rate of adsorption, $k_a P_A$. This corresponds to the \"adsorption flux\" mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nThe crossover between these two regimes occurs when the rates of the competing pathways for the surface intermediate $A*$ are equal. Therefore, the quantitative criterion for the crossover is:\n$$\nk_d(T) = k_r(T)\n$$\nWe denote the temperature at which this condition is met as the crossover temperature, $T_t$. Note that the parameters $k_a$ and $P_A$ do not appear in this criterion, as the crossover is determined solely by the competition between the two unimolecular steps involving the adsorbed species.\n\nTo find $T_t$, we substitute the given Arrhenius expressions for the rate constants, using the notation from the problem statement ($k_{\\text{des}}$ for $k_d$ and $k_{\\text{rxn}}$ for $k_r$):\n$$\nA_{\\text{des}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{des}}}{R T_t}\\right) = A_{\\text{rxn}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger}}{R T_t}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $T_t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(A_{\\text{des}}) - \\frac{E_{\\text{des}}}{R T_t} = \\ln(A_{\\text{rxn}}) - \\frac{E_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger}}{R T_t}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $T_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger}}{R T_t} - \\frac{E_{\\text{des}}}{R T_t} = \\ln(A_{\\text{rxn}}) - \\ln(A_{\\text{des}})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger} - E_{\\text{des}}}{R T_t} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{rxn}}}{A_{\\text{des}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for the crossover temperature:\n$$\nT_t = \\frac{E_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger} - E_{\\text{des}}}{R \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{rxn}}}{A_{\\text{des}}}\\right)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$E_{\\text{des}} = 1.05 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$E_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger} = 1.30 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$A_{\\text{des}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$A_{\\text{rxn}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$R = 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator and the term inside the logarithm:\n$$\nE_{\\text{rxn}}^{\\ddagger} - E_{\\text{des}} = (1.30 \\times 10^{5} - 1.05 \\times 10^{5}) \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 0.25 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 2.5 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\text{rxn}}}{A_{\\text{des}}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.00 \\times 10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 200\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $T_t$:\n$$\nT_t = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times \\ln(200)}\n$$\nUsing $\\ln(200) \\approx 5.298317$:\n$$\nT_t \\approx \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{4}}{8.314 \\times 5.298317} \\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx \\frac{25000}{44.053} \\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 567.51 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we obtain $T_t = 568 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{568}$$", "id": "2669678"}]}
