Assume there are no side reactions, no reverse reaction, and that mass action kinetics holds exactly.

It presents a standard scenario in chemical kinetics that is solvable using fundamental principles. The provided information is complete and consistent. Therefore, we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe autocatalytic reaction is given by $A+X \\xrightarrow{k} 2X$. The rate of reaction, $r(t)$, based on the law of mass action for this second-order process is $r(t)=k\\,A(t)\\,X(t)$, where $A(t)$ and $X(t)$ are the concentrations of species $A$ and $X$ at time $t$, and $k$ is the rate constant.\n\nThe rates of change of the concentrations are derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction. For each mole of $A$ consumed, one mole of $X$ is consumed and two moles of $X$ are produced, resulting in a net production of one mole of $X$.\nThe corresponding differential rate equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k\\,A(t)\\,X(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = +k\\,A(t)\\,X(t)\n$$\nSumming these two equations yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} + \\frac{dX}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(A(t) + X(t)) = -k\\,A(t)\\,X(t) + k\\,A(t)\\,X(t) = 0\n$$\nThis equation implies that the sum of the concentrations of $A$ and $X$ is a conserved quantity. We can integrate this equation with respect to time from $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\nA(t) + X(t) = \\text{constant}\n$$\nUsing the initial conditions $A(0) = A_{0}$ and $X(0) = X_{0}$, we find the value of this constant:\n$$\nA(t) + X(t) = A_{0} + X_{0}\n$$\nThis conservation law holds for all time $t \\ge 0$. We can use this to express $A(t)$ in terms of $X(t)$:\n$$\nA(t) = (A_{0} + X_{0}) - X(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $A(t)$ into the rate equation for $X(t)$ gives a single differential equation in terms of $X(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = k\\,X(t)\\,[(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X(t)]\n$$\nThis is a first-order, nonlinear, separable ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables to prepare for integration:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{X(t)\\,[(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X(t)]} = k\\,dt\n$$\nTo integrate the left-hand side, we use the method of partial fraction decomposition.

Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{total}}\\left(\\frac{1}{X} + \\frac{1}{C_{total} - X}\\right)dX = k\\,dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state at $t=0$ (where $X=X_{0}$) to the state at time $t$ (where the concentration is $X(t)$):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\int_{X_{0}}^{X(t)} \\left(\\frac{1}{X'} + \\frac{1}{(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X'}\\right) dX' = \\int_{0}^{t} k\\,dt'\n$$\nThe reaction progresses from $X_0$ towards $A_0+X_0$, with $A$ decreasing from $A_0$ to $0$. In the range of interest, $X(t)$ and $A(t)=(A_0+X_0)-X(t)$ are positive, so we can omit absolute value signs in the logarithms.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\left[ \\ln(X') - \\ln((A_{0} + X_{0}) - X') \\right]_{X_{0}}^{X(t)} = k[t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{X(t)}{(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{X_{0}}{(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X_{0}}\\right) \\right] = kt\n$$\nRecognizing that $(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X(t) = A(t)$ and $(A_{0} + X_{0}) - X_{0} = A_{0}$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{X(t)}{A(t)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{X_{0}}{A_{0}}\\right) \\right] = kt\n$$\n$$\nkt = \\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}X(t)}{A(t)X_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to find the time $t_{1/2}$ at which $X(t)$ reaches the value $\\frac{A_{0}+X_{0}}{2}$. Let's evaluate the state of the system at this specific time.\nAt $t=t_{1/2}$, we have $X(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_{0}+X_{0}}{2}$.\nUsing the conservation law, the concentration of $A$ at this time is:\n$$\nA(t_{1/2}) = (A_{0} + X_{0}) - X(t_{1/2}) = (A_{0} + X_{0}) - \\frac{A_{0}+X_{0}}{2} = \\frac{A_{0}+X_{0}}{2}\n$$\nThus, at time $t_{1/2}$, the concentrations of $A$ and $X$ are equal: $A(t_{1/2}) = X(t_{1/2})$. The ratio $\\frac{X(t_{1/2})}{A(t_{1/2})} = 1$.\nSubstituting this condition into our integrated rate equation:\n$$\nk t_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{X(t_{1/2})}{A(t_{1/2})}\\right) = \\frac{1}{A_{0} + X_{0}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}} \\cdot 1\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{k(A_{0}+X_{0})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem constraint $0<X_{0}<A_{0}$ ensures that the argument of the logarithm, $\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}}$, is greater than $1$, so $\\ln(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}})$ is positive. Thus, $t_{1/2}$ is positive, which is physically required.\n\nFor the qualitative discussion, we analyze the dependence of $t_{1/2}$ on the initial \"seed\" concentration $X_{0}$, holding $A_{0}$ and $k$ constant.\nThe expression is $t_{1/2}(X_{0}) = \\frac{1}{k(A_{0}+X_{0})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}}\\right)$.\nConsider the limit as $X_{0} \\to 0^{+}$. The term $\\frac{1}{k(A_{0}+X_{0})}$ approaches the finite value $\\frac{1}{k A_{0}}$, while the term $\\ln(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}})$ approaches $+\\infty$. Therefore, $t_{1/2} \\to \\infty$ as $X_{0} \\to 0^{+}$. This is physically sensible: an infinitesimal amount of autocatalyst results in an infinitely long time to reach the specified conversion, as the initial reaction rate is infinitesimally small.\nConsider the other limit as $X_{0} \\to A_{0}^{-}$. The term $\\frac{1}{k(A_{0}+X_{0})}$ approaches the finite value $\\frac{1}{2k A_{0}}$, while the term $\\ln(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}})$ approaches $\\ln(1)=0$. Therefore, $t_{1/2} \\to 0$ as $X_{0} \\to A_{0}^{-}$. This is also logical: if the initial concentration of catalyst $X_{0}$ is already very close to the final concentration $X(t_{1/2})=\\frac{A_0+X_0}{2}$ (since as $X_0 \\to A_0$, the target is $A_0$), the time required to bridge this small gap is very short.\nTo be more rigorous, the derivative of $t_{1/2}$ with respect to $X_{0}$ is strictly negative for $X_{0} \\in (0, A_{0})$, confirming that $t_{1/2}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $X_{0}$. A larger initial seed $X_{0}$ always shortens the time required to reach the state where $A=X$. The dependence is most sensitive for small values of $X_0$ due to the logarithmic term, which is characteristic of the \"induction period\" of autocatalytic reactions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{k(A_{0}+X_{0})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_{0}}{X_{0}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2624643"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the time evolution of a simple autocatalytic system, we now turn to a more general and powerful method of analysis: nondimensionalization.

This is achieved by making the coefficients in the equation equal to unity or simple constants, which consolidates the original parameters into dimensionless groups.\n\nFor the concentration scale, the most logical choice is the total concentration $C$. This is because $X(t)$ is physically bounded by $C$ (as $A(t) = C - X(t)$ must be non-negative). This choice normalizes the autocatalyst concentration to the range $[0, 1]$, assuming $X_0 \\le C$.

To make the primary term of the dynamics, the autocatalytic growth, have a coefficient of unity, we select $t_{char}$ based on the reaction rate.
