The concepts, definitions, and assumptions (indistinguishable particles, classical limit, separability of motions) are standard textbook material. The qualitative description \"well separated ... on chemical scales\" is a common and unambiguous way to state that electronic excitation energies are much larger than typical thermal energies ($k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$), a known physical fact for most molecules under ordinary conditions. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution to be derived.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Chemical Potential**\n\nThe canonical partition function, $Q_N$, for a system of $N$ non-interacting, indistinguishable particles in the classical limit (where the number of accessible states is much larger than the number of particles) is given by:\n$$Q_{N}(T,V) = \\frac{q(T,V)^{N}}{N!}$$\nwhere $q(T,V)$ is the single-particle partition function.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is defined as $F = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln Q_{N}$. Substituting the expression for $Q_N$:\n$$F = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\left(\\frac{q^N}{N!}\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T(N\\ln q - \\ln N!)$$\nFor macroscopic systems where $N$ is large, we apply Stirling’s approximation, $\\ln N! \\approx N\\ln N - N$:\n$$F \\approx -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T(N\\ln q - N\\ln N + N) = -N k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{q}{N}\\right) + 1 \\right)$$\nThe chemical potential, $\\mu$, is the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $N$ at constant $T$ and $V$:\n$$\\mu = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}\\right)_{T,V} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{q}{N}\\right) + 1 \\right) - N k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\left( \\frac{N}{q} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{q}{N^2}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$\\mu = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{q}{N}\\right) + 1 - 1 \\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{q}{N}\\right) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{q}\\right)$$\nThe single-particle partition function $q$ is separable into translational and internal contributions: $q = q_{\\mathrm{trans}}q_{\\mathrm{int}}$. The translational partition function is $q_{\\mathrm{trans}} = V/\\lambda^3$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{q_{\\mathrm{trans}}q_{\\mathrm{int}}}\\right) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{(V/\\lambda^3)q_{\\mathrm{int}}}\\right)$$\nUsing the definition of number density, $n=N/V$, we arrive at the general expression:\n$$\\mu = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n\\lambda^3}{q_{\\mathrm{int}}}\\right)$$\n\n**Analysis for the Monatomic Species**\nFor the monatomic species, the internal structure consists only of a degenerate ground electronic state with degeneracy $g$. It is stated that this degeneracy is temperature-independent, which implies that any electronically excited states are thermally inaccessible ($k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ll \\varepsilon_{j} - \\varepsilon_{0}$). The internal partition function is therefore simply the degeneracy of the ground state:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{int}} = g$$\nSubstituting this into our general expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n\\lambda^3}{g}\\right)$$\nThis result can also be written as $\\mu = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(n\\lambda^3) - k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g$. This demonstrates that the internal degeneracy $g$ lowers the chemical potential by an amount $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g$.\n\n**Analysis for the Diatomic Species**\nFor the diatomic species, the internal partition function includes contributions from electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. The problem directs our focus to the electronic contribution, represented by the electronic partition function, $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$. The chemical potential's dependence on the electronic structure is through this term:\n$$\\mu = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n\\lambda^3}{q_{\\mathrm{elec}} q_{\\mathrm{other\\_internal}}}\\right)$$\nThe electronic partition function is a sum over all electronic energy terms, with energies measured relative to the ground term energy $\\varepsilon_{0}$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{elec}} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} g_j e^{-\\beta(\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0)} = g_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} g_j e^{-\\beta(\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0)}$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\nElectronically excited states (those with $j \\ge 1$) contribute appreciably to $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ when the terms in the summation are not negligible compared to the first term, $g_0$. For any term $j \\ge 1$, its contribution is significant only if the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\\beta(\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0)}$ is not vanishingly small. This requires the exponent to be of order unity or smaller:\n$$\\beta(\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\lesssim 1$$\nThis condition means that the thermal energy $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ must be comparable to the excitation energy gap $\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0$.\nIf this condition is not met for any excited state (i.e., at low to moderate temperatures where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ll \\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon_0$ for all $j \\ge 1$), then all exponential terms are approximately zero, and the partition function is dominated by the ground state term:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{elec}} \\approx g_0$$\nIn this limit, the electronic contribution to the chemical potential reduces to a term $-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln g_0$, analogous to the monatomic case.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\!\\left(n\\lambda^{3}\\right)$; internal degeneracy $g$ does not affect $\\mu$ for indistinguishable particles, so electronic states never modify $\\mu$ in the classical ideal gas.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. Our derivation shows that $\\mu$ explicitly depends on the internal partition function, $q_{\\mathrm{int}}$. For the monatomic case, this becomes a dependence on $g$ via the term $-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g$. The factor of $N!$ for indistinguishability is a separate concept and does not cancel the contribution from internal structure.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\!\\left(n\\lambda^{3}/g\\right)$ for a monatomic species with temperature-independent degeneracy $g$. For a diatomic species, the electronic contribution enters via the internal partition function $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}=\\sum_{j}g_{j}e^{-\\beta(\\varepsilon_{j}-\\varepsilon_{0})}$, so that $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\!\\left(n\\lambda^{3}/q_{\\mathrm{elec}}\\right)$. Electronic excited states contribute appreciably only when $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ is comparable to at least one electronic excitation energy gap, i.e., when $\\beta(\\varepsilon_{j}-\\varepsilon_{0})\\lesssim 1$; otherwise $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}\\approx g_{0}$ and the effect reduces to $-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g_{0}$.**\nThis option correctly states the chemical potential for the monatomic species, $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(n\\lambda^{3}/g)$. It correctly identifies the role and form of the electronic partition function $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ for the diatomic species (in the context of analyzing electronic contributions). It correctly identifies the condition $\\beta(\\varepsilon_{j}-\\varepsilon_{0})\\lesssim 1$ for the contribution of excited states. Finally, it correctly describes the low-temperature limit where $q_{\\mathrm{elec}} \\approx g_0$. Every part of this statement is consistent with our rigorous derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\!\\left(n\\lambda^{3}g\\right)$ for a monatomic species; electronically excited states of a diatomic molecule never contribute to $\\mu$ because electronic and nuclear motions are separated, so $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ is exactly $g_{0}$ at all temperatures.**\nThe formula for the monatomic species is incorrect; the degeneracy $g$ should appear in the denominator of the logarithm's argument, not the numerator. A larger degeneracy increases entropy and thus decreases free energy and chemical potential. The claim that excited states never contribute is false; they contribute at sufficiently high temperatures. The separability of motions (Born-Oppenheimer approximation) allows the definition of $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$, it does not forbid thermal population of excited electronic states.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\!\\left(n\\lambda^{3}\\right)-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g$ holds at all temperatures with $g$ equal to the total number of electronic states (ground plus excited). Electronic excitations always shift $\\mu$ by the same constant, independent of temperature.**\nThe formula $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(n\\lambda^{3}) - k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g$ is equivalent to $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(n\\lambda^3/g)$, which is correct for the monatomic case where $g$ is the ground-state degeneracy. However, the option incorrectly claims this holds at all temperatures with $g$ being the total number of states. The contribution of states is weighted by the Boltzmann factor, so the effective \"degeneracy\" is the temperature-dependent partition function $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}(T)$. The resulting shift to $\\mu$ is $-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln q_{\\mathrm{elec}}(T)$, which is not a constant independent of temperature.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\mu=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln\\!\\left(n\\lambda^{3}/q_{\\mathrm{elec}}\\right)$ applies only to diatomic molecules. For monatomic atoms, tightly bound electrons imply no internal contribution to $\\mu$, so $g$ is irrelevant at all temperatures.**\nThe formula for $\\mu$ is general and not restricted to diatomic molecules. More importantly, the assertion that there is no internal contribution for monatomic atoms is false. Even if excited states are inaccessible (\"tightly bound electrons\"), the ground electronic state can possess a degeneracy $g>1$ (due to spin and/or orbital angular momentum), which contributes a term $-k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln g$ to the chemical potential. This contribution is not irrelevant.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2669050"}, {"introduction": "Building on the general concept of internal structure, we now focus on a specific, dynamic feature of diatomic molecules: vibration.

We first find $\\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$:\n$$ \\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\left[ 1 + 3e^{-2\\theta_r/T} + \\dots \\right] \\right) = -\\ln\\sigma + \\ln\\left( 1 + 3e^{-2\\theta_r/T} + \\dots \\right) $$\nUsing the approximation $\\ln(1+x) \\approx x$ for small $x$ (here, $x=3e^{-2\\theta_r/T}$ is very small):\n$$ \\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) \\approx -\\ln\\sigma + 3e^{-2\\theta_r/T} $$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $T$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln q_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{\\partial T} \\approx \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(3e^{-2\\theta_r/T}\\right) = 3e^{-2\\theta_r/T} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2\\theta_r}{T^2}\\right) = \\frac{6\\theta_r}{T^2} e^{-2\\theta_r/T} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for energy:\n$$ U_{\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T) \\approx R T^2 \\left( \\frac{6\\theta_r}{T^2} e^{-2\\theta_r/T} \\right) = 6 R \\theta_r e^{-2\\theta_r/T} $$\nThis shows that the rotational internal energy approaches zero exponentially as $T \\to 0$.\n\nFinally, we derive the molar rotational heat capacity at constant volume, $C_{V,\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T)$:\n$$ C_{V,\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}}{\\partial T} \\right)_V $$\nDifferentiating the expression for $U_{\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T)$:\n$$ C_{V,\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T) \\approx \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( 6 R \\theta_r e^{-2\\theta_r/T} \\right) = 6 R \\theta_r \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( e^{-2\\theta_r/T} \\right) $$\nThe derivative of the exponential is $e^{-2\\theta_r/T} \\cdot (2\\theta_r/T^2)$. Therefore:\n$$ C_{V,\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T) \\approx 6 R \\theta_r \\left( e^{-2\\theta_r/T} \\cdot \\frac{2\\theta_r}{T^2} \\right) = 12 R \\left(\\frac{\\theta_r}{T}\\right)^2 e^{-2\\theta_r/T} $$\n\nWith these results, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. In the limit $T \\ll \\theta_r$, the single-molecule rotational partition function has the asymptotic expansion...**\nThe statement provides the expansion $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\left[1+3\\,e^{-2\\theta_r/T}+ \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(e^{-6\\theta_r/T}\\right)\\right]$. Our derivation shows exactly this, where the next term is $5e^{-6\\theta_r/T}$, which is of order $\\mathcal{O}(e^{-6\\theta_r/T})$. The expression correctly indicates that $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$ approaches its zero-temperature limit $1/\\sigma$ from above.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the same limit, the molar rotational internal energy satisfies $U_{\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T)\\approx 3 R T$...**\nOur derivation yielded $U_{\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T) \\approx 6 R \\theta_r e^{-2\\theta_r/T}$. This expression correctly shows the energy \"freezing out\" and approaching zero as $T \\to 0$. The form $3RT$ is incorrect; it is not even the correct high-temperature limit for a linear rotor, which is $RT$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the same limit, the molar rotational heat capacity at constant volume satisfies...**\nThe statement provides $C_{V,\\mathrm{rot,\\,molar}}(T)\\approx 12\\,R\\,\\left(\\frac{\\theta_r}{T}\\right)^2 e^{-2\\theta_r/T}$. This matches our derived result precisely.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because only $J=0$ contributes in the limit $T \\to 0$, the symmetry number $\\sigma$ becomes irrelevant and $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)\\to 1$.**\nIn the calculation of $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$, the limit as $T \\to 0$ is $\\lim_{T \\to 0} q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}[1+0+\\dots] = 1/\\sigma$. The symmetry number $\\sigma$ is a fundamental constant factor in the definition of the partition function that accounts for nuclear spin statistics and does not become \"irrelevant\". The statement that $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) \\to 1$ is only true for molecules with $\\sigma=1$ (e.g., heteronuclear diatomics). For homonuclear diatomics like N$_2$ or O$_2$, $\\sigma=2$, and the limit is $1/2$. The statement is not generally correct.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For $T \\ll \\theta_r$, the single-molecule rotational partition function is approximately linear in $T$, $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)\\approx T/(\\sigma \\theta_r)$.**\nThe expression $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)\\approx T/(\\sigma \\theta_r)$ is the well-known high-temperature approximation ($T \\gg \\theta_r$), derived by replacing the partition sum with an integral. In the low-temperature limit $T \\ll \\theta_r$, the partition function approaches a constant value of $1/\\sigma$ with exponential corrections, as shown in option A. The linear approximation is incorrect for this regime.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2669070"}]}
