The integral becomes $\\exp(-z) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(n\\phi)) d\\phi$. We perform a change of variables, $u = n\\phi$, so $d\\phi = du/n$. The integration limits change from $[0, 2\\pi]$ to $[0, 2n\\pi]$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(n\\phi)) d\\phi = \\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{2n\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du\n$$\nSince $\\cos(u)$ is periodic with period $2\\pi$, the integral over $[0, 2n\\pi]$ is $n$ times the integral over $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\int_{0}^{2n\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du = \\frac{n}{n} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos(u)) du\n$$\nThis integral defines the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, $I_0(z)$, via the relation:\n$$\nI_0(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos\\theta) d\\theta\n$$\nThus, the angular integral evaluates to $2\\pi I_0(z) = 2\\pi I_0(\\beta V_0/2)$.\nThe full coordinate integral is $2\\pi \\exp(-\\beta V_0/2) I_0(\\beta V_0/2)$.\n\nCombining the momentum and coordinate integral results, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the torsional partition function:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) = \\frac{1}{nh} \\left(\\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}\\right) \\left(2\\pi \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta V_0}{2}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{\\beta V_0}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nExpressing $\\beta$ in terms of $T$ and $k_B$, this is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\n(iii) Asymptotic Analysis\n\nWe now analyze the behavior of this expression in the specified limits.\n\nLimit 1: Free internal rotor ($V_0 \\to 0$).\nIn this limit, the argument of the exponential and Bessel functions, $z = V_0 / (2k_B T)$, tends to zero. We use the small-argument expansion for these functions:\nAs $z \\to 0$, $\\exp(-z) \\to 1$ and $I_0(z) \\to I_0(0) = 1$.\nSubstituting these into our result for $q_{\\text{tors}}(T)$:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\xrightarrow{V_0 \\to 0} \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh}\n$$\nThis is the correct classical partition function for a one-dimensional free rotor with moment of inertia $I$ and symmetry number $n$, obtained from $q_{\\text{FR}} = \\frac{1}{nh} (\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta p_{\\phi}^2/2I} dp_{\\phi}) (\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi) = \\frac{1}{nh}(\\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T})(2\\pi)$.\n\nLimit 2: Small-amplitude harmonic torsion ($\\beta V_0 \\to \\infty$).\nThis limit corresponds to low temperature or a high potential barrier, where the molecule is confined to small oscillations within one of the potential wells. We analyze the potential $V(\\phi)$ near a minimum, for example at $\\phi=0$. Using a Taylor expansion for the cosine function, $\\cos(x) \\approx 1 - x^2/2$ for small $x$:\n$$\nV(\\phi) = \\frac{V_0}{2}(1 - \\cos(n\\phi)) \\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}\\left(1 - \\left(1-\\frac{(n\\phi)^2}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{V_0 n^2}{4}\\phi^2\n$$\nThis is a harmonic potential $V(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\text{tors}} \\phi^2$ with a torsional force constant $k_{\\text{tors}} = V_0 n^2 / 2$. The classical angular frequency of oscillation is $\\omega = \\sqrt{k_{\\text{tors}}/I} = n\\sqrt{V_0/(2I)}$. The vibration frequency is $\\nu = \\omega/(2\\pi) = \\frac{n}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{V_0/(2I)}$.\nThe classical partition function for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is $q_{\\text{HO,class}} = k_B T / (h\\nu)$. There are $n$ such equivalent wells, and the symmetry number $n$ correctly accounts for this when considering the full rotational space. The expected limiting form is thus:\n$$\nq_{\\text{HO,class}} = \\frac{k_B T}{h \\left( \\frac{n}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{V_0}{2I}} \\right)} = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T \\sqrt{2I}}{nh\\sqrt{V_0}}\n$$\nNow we must show that our exact expression for $q_{\\text{tors}}(T)$ reduces to this form. For large argument $z = \\beta V_0/2 \\to \\infty$, we use the asymptotic expansion for the Bessel function: $I_0(z) \\sim \\exp(z)/\\sqrt{2\\pi z}$.\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\exp(-z) \\frac{\\exp(z)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh \\sqrt{2\\pi z}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4\\pi^2(2\\pi I k_B T)}}{nh \\sqrt{2\\pi z}} = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2(2\\pi I k_B T)}{2\\pi z}} = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi I k_B T}{z}}\n$$\nSubstitute $z = V_0/(2k_B T)$ again:\n$$\nq_{\\text{tors}}(T) \\approx \\frac{1}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi I k_B T}{V_0 / (2k_B T)}} = \\frac{1}{nh} \\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi I (k_B T)^2}{V_0}} = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T \\sqrt{2I}}{nh\\sqrt{V_0}}\n$$\nThis result precisely matches the classical harmonic oscillator partition function $q_{\\text{HO,class}}$ derived above. The asymptotic analysis is therefore successful.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression derived in part (ii).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi I k_B T}}{nh} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right) I_0\\left(\\frac{V_0}{2k_B T}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2817602"}]}
