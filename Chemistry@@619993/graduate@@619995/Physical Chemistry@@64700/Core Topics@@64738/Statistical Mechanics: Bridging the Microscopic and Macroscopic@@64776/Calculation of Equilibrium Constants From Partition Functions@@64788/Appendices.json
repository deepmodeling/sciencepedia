The derivation must begin from the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics.\n\nThe standard equilibrium constant $K^\\circ(T)$ is related to the standard molar Gibbs energy of reaction, $\\Delta_r G^\\circ(T)$, by\n$$K^\\circ(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_r G^\\circ(T)}{R T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_r G^\\circ(T)}{N_A k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant.

We establish a common energy zero by defining the energy of the separated atoms $Y$ at rest to be zero. Thus, $E_{0,\\mathrm{Y}}=0$. The ground state of the molecule $\\mathrm{Y}_2$ is its lowest rovibrational state ($v=0, J=0$). Its energy relative to the separated atoms is $-D_0$, the true dissociation energy.

The Incorrect Calculation**\nThe colleague makes a specific error: they use the spectroscopic dissociation energy $D_e$ instead of $D_0$ in the exponential term, while correctly using the thermal partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib,thermal}}$ to calculate $q_{\\mathrm{Y}_2}^\\circ$. The expression for the partition functions remains the same as in the true calculation.

It is most convenient to work with the natural logarithm of $K^{\\circ}$:\n$$ \\ln K^{\\circ} = \\ln C - \\ln B - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) + \\frac{h c D_0}{k_B T} $$\nThe square of the relative uncertainty, $u_r(K^{\\circ})^2 = (u(K^{\\circ})/K^{\\circ})^2$, is given by:\n$$ u_r(K^{\\circ})^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\ln K^{\\circ})}{\\partial B} \\right)^2 u(B)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\ln K^{\\circ})}{\\partial \\omega} \\right)^2 u(\\omega)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\ln K^{\\circ})}{\\partial D_0} \\right)^2 u(D_0)^2 $$\nWe calculate the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\ln K^{\\circ})}{\\partial B} = -\\frac{1}{B} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\ln K^{\\circ})}{\\partial \\omega} = - \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right)} \\left[ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{h c}{k_B T}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{h c}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right)} = -\\frac{h c}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right) - 1} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial(\\ln K^{\\circ})}{\\partial D_0} = \\frac{h c}{k_B T} $$\nSubstituting these into the uncertainty formula:\n$$ u_r(K^{\\circ})^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{B}\\right)^2 u(B)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{h c}{k_B T} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right) - 1}\\right)^2 u(\\omega)^2 + \\left(\\frac{h c}{k_B T}\\right)^2 u(D_0)^2 $$\n$$ u_r(K^{\\circ})^2 = \\left(\\frac{u(B)}{B}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{h c}{k_B T}\\right)^2 \\frac{u(\\omega)^2}{\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)^2} + \\left(\\frac{h c}{k_B T}\\right)^2 u(D_0)^2 $$\nLet us denote the three terms contributing to the squared relative uncertainty as $S_B^2$, $S_\\omega^2$, and $S_{D_0}^2$. We now evaluate these terms using the provided data: $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $B = 1.50\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ with $u(B) = 0.005\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\omega = 1600\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ with $u(\\omega) = 5\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $D_0 = 25000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ with $u(D_0) = 25\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the constant $\\frac{h c}{k_B} = 1.4387769\\ \\mathrm{K\\ cm}$.\nFirst, calculate the common factor $\\frac{h c}{k_B T}$:\n$$ \\frac{h c}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.4387769\\ \\mathrm{K\\ cm}}{298\\ \\mathrm{K}} \\approx 0.00482811\\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\nThe contribution from the rotational constant uncertainty is:\n$$ S_B^2 = \\left(\\frac{u(B)}{B}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.005\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{1.50\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right)^2 \\approx 1.111 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThe contribution from the vibrational wavenumber uncertainty is:\nThe argument of the exponential is $\\frac{h c \\omega}{k_B T} = (0.00482811\\ \\mathrm{cm}) \\times (1600\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\approx 7.725$.\nThe denominator term is $\\exp(7.725) - 1 \\approx 2264 - 1 = 2263$.\n$$ S_\\omega^2 = (0.00482811\\ \\mathrm{cm})^2 \\frac{(5\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^2}{(2263)^2} \\approx (2.331 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2) \\frac{25\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}}{5.121 \\times 10^6} \\approx 1.138 \\times 10^{-10} $$\nThe contribution from the dissociation energy uncertainty is:\n$$ S_{D_0}^2 = \\left(\\frac{h c}{k_B T}\\right)^2 u(D_0)^2 = (0.00482811\\ \\mathrm{cm})^2 (25\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})^2 \\approx (2.331 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2) (625\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}) \\approx 0.01457 $$\nComparing the contributions:\n$S_{D_0}^2 \\approx 1.457 \\times 10^{-2}$\n$S_B^2 \\approx 1.111 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$S_\\omega^2 \\approx 1.138 \\times 10^{-10}$\nThe uncertainty in the dissociation energy $D_0$ provides the dominant contribution to the total uncertainty in $K^{\\circ}$, by several orders of magnitude. This is because $K^{\\circ}$ depends exponentially on $D_0$, and the term $\\frac{h c D_0}{k_B T}$ is large, which amplifies the effect of the uncertainty in $D_0$. The contribution from the vibrational frequency is negligible because the vibrational mode is mostly in its ground state at $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ (since $\\frac{h c\\omega}{k_B T} \\gg 1$), making the partition function insensitive to small changes in $\\omega$.\n\nThe total squared relative uncertainty is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ u_r(K^{\\circ})^2 = S_B^2 + S_\\omega^2 + S_{D_0}^2 \\approx 1.111 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.138 \\times 10^{-10} + 0.01457 \\approx 0.014581 $$\nThe combined relative standard uncertainty is the square root:\n$$ u_r(K^{\\circ}) = \\sqrt{0.014581} \\approx 0.12075 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain $0.121$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.121}$$", "id": "2626493"}]}
