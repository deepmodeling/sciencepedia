For a linear rotor, the degeneracy of the level $J$ is given by $g_J = 2J+1$. The population of the entire level $J$, denoted $N_J$, is the sum of the populations of its constituent states. Since all states within a given level $J$ have the same energy $E_J$, the level population is proportional to the degeneracy multiplied by the Boltzmann factor:\n$$\nN_J \\propto g_J \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_J}{k_B T}\\right) = (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_J}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor a rigid, linear rotor, the energy of a rotational level $J$ is given by:\n$$\nE_J = h c B_0 J(J+1)\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $B_0$ is the rotational constant in wavenumbers.\n\nThe ratio of the populations of two levels, $J_1$ and $J_2$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{J_1}}{N_{J_2}} = \\frac{(2J_1+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c B_0 J_1(J_1+1)}{k_B T}\\right)}{(2J_2+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c B_0 J_2(J_2+1)}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio for $J_1=10$ and $J_2=0$.

The state of the molecule is described by its energy levels. The rotational partition function, $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$, is defined as a sum over all accessible rotational states:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) = \\sum_{J} g_{J} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{J})$$\nwhere $J$ is the rotational quantum number, $g_{J}$ is the degeneracy of level $J$, $\\epsilon_{J}$ is the energy of level $J$, and $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\n\nThe rigid-rotor approximation assumes the bond length is fixed at $r_{e}$. This gives energy levels $\\epsilon_{J} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}J(J+1)$ with $I = \\mu r_{e}^2$ and degeneracies $g_{J} = 2J+1$. In this model, $J$ can take any non-negative integer value, $J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, \\infty$. The partition function is an infinite sum:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot, rigid}}(T) = \\sum_{J=0}^{\\infty} (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta\\hbar^2}{2I}J(J+1)\\right)$$\nIn the high-temperature limit ($T \\to \\infty$, or $\\beta \\to 0$), the spacing between energy levels becomes small compared to $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, and this sum can be approximated by an integral, yielding $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) \\approx \\frac{2Ik_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\hbar^2}$. This result indicates that the partition function grows linearly with temperature, which implies the sum itself diverges.\n\nHowever, this model is unphysical. A real chemical bond is not rigid and has a finite dissociation energy, $D_{e}$. The stability of a rotating molecule is correctly analyzed using the effective potential energy, $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r)$, which includes the centrifugal effects. For a rotational state $J$, the effective potential is given by:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r) = V(r) + \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} = V(r) + \\frac{\\hbar^2 J(J+1)}{2\\mu r^2}$$\nHere, $V(r)$ is the true molecular potential (e.g., a Morse potential), which approaches the dissociation energy $D_{e}$ as $r \\to \\infty$ (with $V(r_{e}) = 0$). The second term is the centrifugal potential, which is always repulsive and increases with $J$.\n\nFor $J=0$, $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r) = V(r)$, which possesses a potential well of depth $D_{e}$ that supports bound vibrational states. As $J$ increases, the centrifugal term is added. This term raises the energy minimum of the potential well and makes the well shallower. For a sufficiently large value of $J$, the minimum of the effective potential disappears entirely, or the energy at the minimum exceeds the dissociation energy $D_{e}$. Beyond this critical value, $J_{\\max}$, no stable, bound molecular states can exist; the centrifugal force is so strong that it breaks the chemical bond.\n\nTherefore, the summation for the partition function cannot extend to infinity. It must be truncated at $J_{\\max}$, including only the physically real, bound states:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot, bound}}(T) = \\sum_{J=0}^{J_{\\max}} (2J+1) \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{J})$$\nThis sum is now a finite sum of terms. We are asked to evaluate its behavior in the high-temperature limit, i.e., as $T \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) \\to 0$. For any finite energy level $\\epsilon_J$, the Boltzmann factor becomes:\n$$\\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{J}) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nTherefore, the partition function converges to a finite limit, which is the sum of the degeneracies of all bound rotational states:\n$$\\lim_{T \\to \\infty} q_{\\mathrm{rot, bound}}(T) = \\sum_{J=0}^{J_{\\max}} (2J+1)$$\nThis sum is a well-known arithmetic progression, equal to $(J_{\\max}+1)^2$.\n$$\\sum_{J=0}^{J_{\\max}} (2J+1) = 2 \\left(\\sum_{J=0}^{J_{\\max}} J\\right) + \\sum_{J=0}^{J_{\\max}} 1 = 2 \\frac{J_{\\max}(J_{\\max}+1)}{2} + (J_{\\max}+1) = (J_{\\max}+1)(J_{\\max}+1) = (J_{\\max}+1)^2$$\nThus, the rotational partition function, when correctly accounting for dissociation by including only bound states, converges to a finite value $(J_{\\max}+1)^2$ as $T \\to \\infty$. At such high temperatures, the molecule would in reality have a high probability of being dissociated, and a proper thermodynamic description would require considering the chemical equilibrium between the molecule and its constituent atoms. The bound-state partition function alone would cease to be sufficient.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. The rigid-rotor picture remains valid up to arbitrarily high $J$, so there is no $J_{\\max}$; consequently, $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$ grows without bound as $T$ increases and this growth is physically correct even near dissociation.\nThis statement is incorrect. The central premise, that the rigid-rotor picture is valid at high $J$, is false. Centrifugal forces cause the bond to stretch and eventually break, which is the fundamental reason for the breakdown.\n\nB. The rigid-rotor picture breaks down near dissociation because centrifugal distortion and the finite $D_{e}$ impose a finite $J_{\\max}$ for bound states; when only bound levels are counted, $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$ converges to a finite limit $\\sum_{J=0}^{J_{\\max}}(2J+1)=(J_{\\max}+1)^{2}$ as $T\\to\\infty$, while at sufficiently high $T$ the molecule dissociates and a bound-state rotational partition function ceases to control the thermodynamics.\nThis statement is entirely correct. It accurately describes the physical reason for the existence of $J_{\\max}$, correctly computes the high-temperature limit of the truncated partition function, and correctly notes the physical limitation of using only the bound-state partition function at temperatures where dissociation is prevalent.\n\nC. The rigid-rotor picture breaks down near dissociation, and because level spacings shrink indefinitely, the density of states diverges so that $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$ diverges faster than linearly with $T$ when $T$ is very large.\nThis statement is incorrect. While vibrational level spacings shrink near dissociation, the crucial factor for the rotational partition function is the finite number of bound rotational states, which truncates the sum. This truncation ensures the partition function converges to a finite value, rather than diverging.\n\nD. The breakdown of the rigid-rotor picture and the existence of $J_{\\max}$ occur only for heteronuclear diatomics with a permanent dipole; homonuclear diatomics do not exhibit this behavior, so $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$ grows without bound for them.\nThis statement is incorrect. The existence of $J_{\\max}$ is a consequence of mechanical instability due to centrifugal forces acting against a bond of finite strength. This phenomenon applies to all molecules, including homonuclear diatomics (e.g., $\\mathrm{H}_2$, $\\mathrm{N}_2$), regardless of whether they possess a permanent dipole moment. A dipole moment is relevant for spectroscopic activity, not mechanical stability.\n\nE. The coupling of rotation to vibration near dissociation forces all rotational levels upward so strongly that $q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T)$ tends to zero as $T\\to\\infty$ when only bound states are counted.\nThis statement is incorrect. The partition function is a sum of positive terms. In the high-temperature limit, the exponential terms approach $1$, not zero. Therefore, the sum must approach a finite, positive value, specifically $(J_{\\max}+1)^2$, not zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2684007"}]}
