The denominator $Q$ is a constant for a fixed temperature $T$, so we only need to find the maximum of the numerator, $N_J \\propto g_J e^{-E_J/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze Model I, where the degeneracy $g_J = 1$ for all non-negative integers $J$.\nThe population of level $J$ is proportional to:\n$$ p_J \\propto 1 \\cdot e^{-B J(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nThe energy $E_J = B J(J+1)$ is a strictly increasing function for $J \\ge 0$, since $B>0$. The exponential function $e^{-x}$ is a strictly decreasing function of its argument $x$. Therefore, the population $p_J$ is a strictly decreasing function of $J$ for any finite temperature $T > 0$.

A $2$-level system formed by levels $1$ and $2$ is driven resonantly by a strong monochromatic coherent field at angular frequency $\\omega_{12}$, with Rabi frequency $\\Omega$ much larger than the spontaneous emission rate $\\gamma$ of the $2 \\to 1$ transition. No other levels or reservoirs are involved.\n\nThis describes a coherently driven two-level atom. The dynamics are governed by the optical Bloch equations. In the steady state, the population of the excited state $|2\\rangle$ is given by $\\rho_{22} = \\frac{\\Omega^2/2}{\\gamma^2/2 + \\Delta^2 + \\Omega^2}$, where $\\Delta$ is the detuning, which is $0$ for resonant driving. Assuming for simplicity that the degeneracies are $g_1=g_2=1$, the populations are $p_1 = \\rho_{11}$ and $p_2 = \\rho_{22}$.\nIn this case, the steady-state population of level $2$ is:\n$$ p_2 = \\rho_{22} = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2} $$\nThe population of level $1$ is $p_1 = 1 - p_2 = \\frac{\\gamma^2 + \\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2}$.\nFor population inversion, we require $p_2 > p_1$.\n$$ \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2} > \\frac{\\gamma^2 + \\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2} \\implies \\Omega^2 > \\gamma^2 + \\Omega^2 \\implies 0 > \\gamma^2 $$\nThis is impossible since the spontaneous emission rate $\\gamma$ is a positive quantity. The maximum population of the upper state is achieved in the limit of very strong driving ($\\Omega \\gg \\gamma$), where $p_2 \\to \\frac{\\Omega^2}{2\\Omega^2} = 1/2$. The populations equalize but never invert. Even if we strictly adhere to the problem's premise of using rate equations, with a coherent drive causing stimulated absorption and emission at an equal rate $W$, the rate equations are $\\dot{p}_2 = W p_1 - W p_2 - \\gamma p_2$ and $\\dot{p}_1 = -W p_1 + W p_2 + \\gamma p_2$. In steady state, $W p_1 = (W+\\gamma)p_2$, giving $p_2/p_1 = W/(W+\\gamma) < 1$. No inversion is possible.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. A $3$-level system is continuously pumped from level $1$ to level $3$ at rate $W_p$. Rapid nonradiative relaxation brings population from level $3$ to level $2$ at a rate $k_{32}$ satisfying $k_{32} \\gg W_p, A_{21}$, where $A_{21}$ is the spontaneous emission rate for $2 \\to 1$.\n\nThis describes a classic three-level laser pumping scheme. Let us write the rate equations for the populations $p_1, p_2, p_3$ in the steady state ($\\dot{p}_i=0$), assuming for simplicity $g_1=g_2=g_3=1$:\n$$ \\dot{p}_3 = W_p p_1 - k_{32} p_3 = 0 \\implies p_3 = \\frac{W_p}{k_{32}} p_1 $$\n$$ \\dot{p}_2 = k_{32} p_3 - A_{21} p_2 = 0 \\implies k_{32} p_3 = A_{21} p_2 $$\nWe have ignored other weak processes as per the problem description. Substituting the expression for $p_3$ into the second equation:\n$$ k_{32} \\left(\\frac{W_p}{k_{32}} p_1\\right) = A_{21} p_2 \\implies W_p p_1 = A_{21} p_2 $$\nThis yields the population ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{W_p}{A_{21}} $$\nFor population inversion ($p_2/p_1 > 1$), we need the pumping rate to be greater than the decay rate of the upper lasing level, $W_p > A_{21}$. This is a standard condition for laser operation and is achievable by using a sufficiently strong pump. The condition $k_{32} \\gg A_{21}$ ensures that population arriving in level $3$ is efficiently transferred to level $2$ rather than decaying back to level $1$, which is crucial for the mechanism to work well. In the presence of degeneracies, the condition becomes $p_2/g_2 > p_1/g_1$, which requires $W_p/A_{21} > g_2/g_1$, which is also achievable. This mechanism drives a net population flow through the cycle $1 \\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1$, which is a direct violation of detailed balance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. A $2$-level system formed by levels $1$ and $2$ is coupled only to a single blackbody radiation field at temperature $T$ and the buffer gas at the same temperature $T$.\n\nThe system is coupled to reservoirs that are all at the same temperature $T$. According to the zeroth law of thermodynamics, the system will equilibrate with these reservoirs and reach the same temperature $T$. As demonstrated in the introductory analysis, a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ has its populations governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which forbids population inversion between levels with $E_2 > E_1$. This system obeys detailed balance by construction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. A $2$-level system formed by levels $1$ and $2$ is coupled to two distinct thermal radiation reservoirs: absorption $1 \\to 2$ couples to a hot source at temperature $T_h$, while emission $2 \\to 1$ couples predominantly to a cold sink at temperature $T_c$, with $T_h > T_c$.\n\nThis arrangement describes a non-equilibrium system driven by a temperature difference. We can model the rates as follows. The upward transition rate is driven by the hot reservoir: $R_{1 \\to 2} = W_{12} p_1$, where $W_{12}$ is proportional to the photon number density at $T_h$, i.e., $W_{12} = C n(\\omega_{21}, T_h)$, where $n(\\omega, T) = (e^{\\hbar\\omega/k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} - 1)^{-1}$. The downward rate involves both spontaneous emission (rate $A_{21}$) and stimulated emission, which is driven by the cold reservoir: $R_{2 \\to 1} = (A_{21} + W_{21}) p_2$, where $W_{21} = C' n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$. Using Einstein relations $g_1 C = g_2 C'$, we can set up the steady-state equation $R_{1 \\to 2} = R_{2 \\to 1}$.\n$$ (g_2 C p_1) n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) = (g_1 A_{21} + g_1 C n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)) p_2 $$\nThe population ratio per state is:\n$$ \\frac{p_2/g_2}{p_1/g_1} = \\frac{C n(\\omega_{21}, T_h)}{A_{21} + C n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)} $$\nPopulation inversion ($p_2/g_2 > p_1/g_1$) is achieved if $C n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) > A_{21} + C n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$, or $n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) > A_{21}/C + n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$. Since $T_h > T_c$, we have $n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) > n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$. Therefore, if the coupling $C$ is sufficiently strong relative to the spontaneous emission rate $A_{21}$, this condition can be met. This establishes a non-equilibrium steady state with a net flow of energy from the hot to the cold reservoir, necessarily violating detailed balance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. A $3$-level $\\Lambda$-system with lower states $1$ and $2$ and an excited state $3$ is driven by two phase-coherent lasers implementing a Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) sequence.\n\nSTIRAP is a coherent quantum control technique that allows for the transfer of population from an initial state $|1\\rangle$ to a final state $|2\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|3\\rangle$, without significantly populating state $|3\\rangle$. This is achieved by applying a \"counterintuitive\" pulse sequence: the Stokes laser (coupling $|2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$) is applied before the pump laser (coupling $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$). If the process is adiabatic, the system's state vector evolves along a \"dark state\" superposition which changes from being purely state $|1\\rangle$ at the beginning to purely state $|2\\rangle$ at the end. An ideal STIRAP process can achieve nearly $100\\%$ transfer efficiency. If the system starts with its entire population in level $1$ ($p_1=1, p_2=0, p_3=0$), after the STIRAP sequence it will be in the state $p_1=0, p_2=1, p_3=0$. This constitutes a complete population inversion between levels $1$ and $2$. As STIRAP is a process driven by external coherent fields, it is fundamentally non-equilibrium and does not obey detailed balance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, mechanisms B, D, and E are all capable of producing a population inversion and, as a necessary consequence, all operate in a non-equilibrium regime that violates the principle of detailed balance for a single temperature.", "answer": "D", "id": "2671128"}]}
