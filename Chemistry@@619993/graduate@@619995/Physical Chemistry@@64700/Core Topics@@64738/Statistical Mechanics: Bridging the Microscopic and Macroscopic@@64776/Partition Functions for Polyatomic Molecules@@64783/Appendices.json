All necessary data and constants are provided, and the assumptions are clearly defined and physically appropriate for an introductory problem in statistical mechanics. We shall therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. First, we must derive the single-molecule vibrational partition function, $q_{\\text{vib}}(T)$. Second, we must calculate the molar vibrational internal energy at absolute zero, $U_{\\text{vib}}(T=0)$.\n\nFor the first part, we begin from fundamental principles. The canonical partition function, $q$, for a single molecule is defined as the sum over all its quantum states $j$, weighted by the Boltzmann factor:\n$$q = \\sum_{j} g_{j} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon_{j}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\sum_{j} g_{j} \\exp(-\\beta \\epsilon_{j})$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{j}$ is the energy of state $j$, $g_{j}$ is its degeneracy, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\beta = (k_{B}T)^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem instructs us to consider only the vibrational contribution and to use the harmonic oscillator model. The energy levels of a single quantum harmonic oscillator for a given normal mode $i$ are given by:\n$$\\epsilon_{v_i} = \\left(v_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)h\\nu_{i} = \\left(v_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}$$\nwhere $v_i = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ is the vibrational quantum number, $h$ is the Planck constant, $\\nu_{i}$ is the fundamental frequency of the mode, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}$ is the corresponding wavenumber. Each of these energy levels is non-degenerate, so $g_{v_i} = 1$ for all $v_i$.\n\nThe partition function for a single vibrational mode $i$, denoted $q_{\\text{vib},i}$, is the sum over all its possible vibrational quantum numbers:\n$$q_{\\text{vib},i} = \\sum_{v_i=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left[-\\beta\\left(v_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}\\right]$$\nWe can separate the exponential term:\n$$q_{\\text{vib},i} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2}\\right) \\sum_{v_i=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta v_i hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})$$\n$$q_{\\text{vib},i} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2}\\right) \\sum_{v_i=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})\\right]^{v_i}$$\nThe summation is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n$, which converges to $(1-x)^{-1}$ for $|x|<1$. Here, $x = \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})$. Since $\\beta$, $h$, $c$, and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}$ are all positive, $x$ is always between $0$ and $1$, so the series converges. The sum is therefore:\n$$\\sum_{v_i=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})\\right]^{v_i} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})}$$\nSubstituting this result back gives the partition function for a single vibrational mode:\n$$q_{\\text{vib},i}(T) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2k_{B}T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}$$\nThe problem states that the normal modes are separable. For separable degrees of freedom, the total partition function is the product of the individual partition functions. For a non-linear triatomic molecule, there are $3N-6=3(3)-6=3$ vibrational modes. Thus, the total vibrational partition function $q_{\\text{vib}}$ is:\n$$q_{\\text{vib}}(T) = q_{\\text{vib},1}(T) \\times q_{\\text{vib},2}(T) \\times q_{\\text{vib},3}(T) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} q_{\\text{vib},i}(T)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q_{\\text{vib},i}(T)$, we arrive at the complete expression for the single-molecule vibrational partition function:\n$$q_{\\text{vib}}(T) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2k_{B}T}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}$$\nThis concludes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the molar internal energy due to vibration at absolute zero, $U_{\\text{vib}}(T=0)$. The average internal energy $U$ of a system of $N$ non-interacting particles is related to the canonical partition function $Q$ by:\n$$U = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln Q}{\\partial \\beta}\\right)_{V, N}$$\nFor a system of $N$ distinguishable particles (or for any system where indistinguishability corrections do not affect the energy, which is the case here), $Q = q^N$, so $\\ln Q = N \\ln q$. The molar internal energy is obtained by setting $N = N_{A}$, the Avogadro constant.\n$$U_{\\text{m}} = -N_{A} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln q}{\\partial \\beta}\\right)_{V}$$\nApplying this to our vibrational partition function $q_{\\text{vib}}(T)$:\n$$U_{\\text{vib}}(T) = -N_{A} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{3} q_{\\text{vib},i}\\right) = -N_{A} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\ln(q_{\\text{vib},i})$$\n$$U_{\\text{vib}}(T) = -N_{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(q_{\\text{vib},i})$$\nFirst, we find the expression for $\\ln(q_{\\text{vib},i})$:\n$$\\ln(q_{\\text{vib},i}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2})}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})}\\right) = -\\frac{\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})\\right)$$\nNow we differentiate with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln(q_{\\text{vib},i})}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} - \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})} \\cdot \\left(-hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i} \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln(q_{\\text{vib},i})}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} + \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i} \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i})} = -\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} + \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{\\exp(\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}) - 1}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $U_{\\text{vib}}(T)$:\n$$U_{\\text{vib}}(T) = -N_{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(-\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} + \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{\\exp(\\beta hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}) - 1}\\right)$$\n$$U_{\\text{vib}}(T) = N_{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} + \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{k_{B}T}\\right) - 1}\\right)$$\nWe are asked to find the value at absolute zero, $T=0$.

The internal energy at $T=0$ is therefore the sum of the zero-point energies of all modes, multiplied by the Avogadro constant:\n$$U_{\\text{vib}}(T=0) = N_{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{2} = \\frac{N_{A}hc}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\tilde{\\nu}_{i}$$\nThis is the molar vibrational zero-point energy.

While the rigid-rotor model provides a good starting point, its correct application requires a careful accounting for indistinguishable molecular orientations. This is accomplished using the symmetry number, $\\sigma$, but its determination is not always trivial. This problem [@problem_id:2658506] addresses a sophisticated and common point of confusion: the distinction between the full set of symmetry operations of a molecule and the subset of proper physical rotations that define $\\sigma$. By analyzing a molecule where this difference is critical, you will gain a deeper physical intuition for why the symmetry correction is necessary and how to apply it rigorously.", "problem": "A rigid, non-linear polyatomic molecule is modeled at high temperature where its rotational motion can be treated classically. The classical canonical partition function is obtained from the fundamental statistical mechanical definition as a phase-space integral over orientations and conjugate angular momenta. In this setting, overcounting of indistinguishable configurations arises if distinct orientations that are related by proper spatial rotations of the molecule’s symmetry are counted multiple times. A frequent mistake is to set the symmetry number equal to the order of the full point group, including improper operations such as reflections and inversion, thereby dividing by the wrong count of indistinguishable orientations and biasing the rotational partition function.\n\nConsider the specific case of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, which is well described as a rigid rotor with principal moments of inertia $I_{A}$, $I_{B}$, and $I_{C}$, and has point group $C_{2h}$.

It requires an application of fundamental principles of classical statistical mechanics to a specific, realistic molecular system.\n\nThe classical rotational partition function, $q_{\\text{rot}}$, for a single non-linear rigid rotor is defined by an integral over the relevant portion of phase space, corrected for the overcounting of indistinguishable orientations. The general expression is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma h^{3}} \\int \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\text{rot}}) \\, d\\mathcal{P} \\, d\\mathcal{Q}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1}$ with $k_B$ as the Boltzmann constant and $T$ as the absolute temperature, and $H_{\\text{rot}}$ is the classical rotational Hamiltonian. The integration is over the rotational phase space coordinates, which consist of three generalized momenta $\\mathcal{P}$ (the angular momenta) and three generalized coordinates $\\mathcal{Q}$ (the Euler angles specifying orientation). The term $\\sigma$ is the symmetry number, which is the crucial element of this problem.\n\nLet us define an uncorrected partition function, $q'_{\\text{rot}}$, as the full phase-space integral without the symmetry correction factor:\n$$\nq'_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{h^{3}} \\int \\exp(-\\beta H_{\\text{rot}}) \\, d\\mathcal{P} \\, d\\mathcal{Q}\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian for a rigid rotor expressed in the principal axis frame is $H_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{P_A^2}{2I_A} + \\frac{P_B^2}{2I_B} + \\frac{P_C^2}{2I_C}$, where $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_C$ are the components of angular momentum along the principal axes with moments of inertia $I_A$, $I_B$, and $I_C$. The phase space integral separates into a momentum part and a configuration (orientation) part.

However, this integral overcounts indistinguishable orientations. The symmetry number, $\\sigma$, is introduced to correct for this overcounting by dividing the result by the number of equivalent orientations.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the correct determination of $\\sigma$. The configuration of a rigid molecule is its orientation in space. Two orientations are physically indistinguishable if one can be transformed into the other by a physical rotation of the entire molecule that corresponds to a symmetry operation of the molecule. Such physical rotations are exclusively *proper rotations* (identity $E$ and rotations $C_n$). Improper symmetry operations, such as reflections ($\\sigma$) and inversions ($i$), cannot be achieved by physically rotating the rigid body in space; they would require its disassembly and reassembly into a mirror image. Therefore, the number of truly indistinguishable orientations that are counted in the $8\\pi^2$ orientational integral is equal to the number of proper rotation operations in the molecule's point group. This number is the order of the subgroup of proper rotations, denoted $\\lvert G^{+} \\rvert$.\n\nThus, the physically correct rotational partition function is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rot}}^{(\\text{correct})} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{correct}}} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\lvert G^{+} \\rvert}\n$$\nThe problem describes a \"naive\" calculation where the student mistakenly uses the order of the full point group, $\\lvert G \\rvert$, as the symmetry number. The full point group $G$ includes both proper and improper symmetry operations. This leads to the \"naive\" partition function:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rot}}^{(\\text{naive})} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{naive}}} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\lvert G \\rvert}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{q_{\\text{rot}}^{(\\text{naive})}}{q_{\\text{rot}}^{(\\text{correct})}}$. Substituting the expressions above, we derive the general analytical form for this ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{ \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\lvert G \\rvert} }{ \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\lvert G^{+} \\rvert} } = \\frac{\\lvert G^{+} \\rvert}{\\lvert G \\rvert}\n$$\nNote that the detailed expression for $q'_{\\text{rot}}$, including the moments of inertia and temperature, cancels out, as expected. The ratio $R$ depends only on the orders of the symmetry groups.\n\nNow, we evaluate this ratio for the specific case of trans-$1$,$2$-dichloroethylene, which has the point group $C_{2h}$.\nThe full point group is $G = C_{2h}$. The symmetry operations in this group are:\n$E$ (identity), $C_2$ (a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation), $i$ (inversion), and $\\sigma_h$ (reflection across a plane perpendicular to the $C_2$ axis).\nThe order of the full point group is the total number of symmetry operations. Therefore, $\\lvert G \\rvert = \\lvert C_{2h} \\rvert = 4$.\n\nNext, we must identify the subgroup of proper rotations, $G^{+}$. Proper rotations are the identity $E$ and the pure rotations $C_n$.\nFrom the set of operations $\\{E, C_2, i, \\sigma_h\\}$:\n- $E$ is a proper rotation.\n- $C_2$ is a proper rotation.\n- $i$ is an improper rotation.\n- $\\sigma_h$ is an improper rotation.\nThe set of proper rotations is $\\{E, C_2\\}$. This set forms a subgroup of $C_{2h}$ (isomorphic to $C_2$).\nThe order of this subgroup is $\\lvert G^{+} \\rvert = 2$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these values into our derived expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\lvert G^{+} \\rvert}{\\lvert G \\rvert} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis result quantifies the error made by using the order of the full point group instead of the order of its proper rotation subgroup.

The energy $V_3$ here is per molecule. The problem provides a molar energy, $V_{3,m}$, and specifies the result in terms of the gas constant $R$. Using the relations $V_{3} = V_{3,m}/N_A$ and $k_B=R/N_A$, the argument of the functions becomes $\\frac{V_3}{k_B T} = \\frac{V_{3,m}}{RT}$.
