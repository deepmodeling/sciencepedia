The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, thus a solution may be constructed.\n\nFirst, we address the origin of the symmetry number, $\\sigma$. The classical canonical partition function for a single non-linear rigid rotor is given by the phase-space integral over its rotational degrees of freedom. A rigid rotor has three rotational degrees of freedom, so its phase space is six-dimensional. The partition function is:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\iint \\exp(-\\beta E_{\\text{rot}}) \\, d\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{rot}} \\, d\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{rot}}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, and $E_{\\text{rot}}$ is the rotational kinetic energy. The integration is over the three conjugate pairs of rotational coordinates and momenta.\n\nIt is more convenient to express the kinetic energy in terms of the principal moments of inertia ($I_A$, $I_B$, $I_C$) and the components of the angular momentum vector $\\mathbf{L}$ in the molecule-fixed principal axis frame ($L_A$, $L_B$, $L_C$). The rotational Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{rot}} = H_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{L_A^2}{2I_A} + \\frac{L_B^2}{2I_B} + \\frac{L_C^2}{2I_C}\n$$\nThe phase space integral can be separated into an integral over angular momentum space and an integral over orientational space. The volume element becomes $d\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{rot}} \\, d\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{rot}} \\rightarrow dL_x dL_y dL_z \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta \\sin\\theta \\, d\\psi$, where $(\\phi, \\theta, \\psi)$ are the Euler angles defining the molecule's orientation in a space-fixed frame. The integral over the components of angular momentum in the space-fixed frame gives:\n$$\n\\int \\exp\\left(-\\beta H_{\\text{rot}}\\right) \\, dL_x \\, dL_y \\, dL_z = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\det(\\mathbf{I})} = (2\\pi k_B T)^{3/2} \\sqrt{I_A I_B I_C}\n$$\nThis result is independent of orientation.

For a molecule possessing rotational symmetry, multiple orientations in space are physically indistinguishable because they can be transformed into one another by a rotation operation that permutes identical nuclei. For example, a $180$-degree rotation of a water molecule about its $C_2$ axis results in a configuration identical to the original. The integral over Euler angles counts both of these orientations as distinct contributions to the partition function, which is incorrect. The degree of this overcounting is precisely the number of proper rotational symmetry operations (including the identity) that map the molecule onto an indistinguishable configuration. This number is the rotational symmetry number, denoted by $\\sigma$. It is the order of the rotational subgroup of the molecule's point group.\n\nTo correct for this overcounting of indistinguishable states, we must divide the partition function $q'_{\\text{rot}}$ by $\\sigma$. The correct classical rotational partition function is therefore:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{h^3} (2\\pi k_B T)^{3/2} \\sqrt{I_A I_B I_C}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in a more common form, which is identical to the high-temperature limit of the quantum mechanical rotational partition function:\n$$\nq_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^2 k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{I_A I_B I_C}\n$$\nThe problem states that the quantities $I_A$, $I_B$, $I_C$, and $T$ are identical for all four molecules. Thus, the entire expression aside from $\\sigma$ is a constant, let us call it $C$:\n$$\nC = \\sqrt{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^2 k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\sqrt{I_A I_B I_C}\n$$\nThe rotational partition function for a given molecule $X$ is then simply $q_{\\text{rot}}(X) = C/\\sigma_X$.\n\nNext, we must determine the symmetry number $\\sigma$ for each of the four specified molecular geometries.\n1.  Methane ($\\text{CH}_4$): This molecule has a tetrahedral geometry, belonging to the $T_d$ point group. The proper rotation operations are the identity ($E$), eight $C_3$ rotations along the C-H bonds ($4 \\times 2 = 8$), and three $C_2$ rotations bisecting opposite H-C-H angles. The rotational subgroup is $T$, with order $|\\text{T}| = 1 + 8 + 3 = 12$. Thus, $\\sigma(\\text{CH}_4) = 12$.\n\n2.  Ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$): This molecule has a trigonal pyramidal geometry, belonging to the $C_{3v}$ point group. The proper rotation operations are the identity ($E$) and two $C_3$ rotations about the principal axis. The rotational subgroup is $C_3$, with order $|C_3| = 1 + 2 = 3$. Thus, $\\sigma(\\text{NH}_3) = 3$.\n\n3.  Water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$): This molecule has a bent geometry, belonging to the $C_{2v}$ point group. The proper rotation operations are the identity ($E$) and one $C_2$ rotation about the axis bisecting the H-O-H angle. The rotational subgroup is $C_2$, with order $|C_2| = 1 + 1 = 2$. Thus, $\\sigma(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) = 2$.\n\n4.  Benzene ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$): This molecule is a planar regular hexagon, belonging to the $D_{6h}$ point group. The proper rotations constitute the $D_6$ group. These are the identity ($E$), rotations about the principal $C_6$ axis ($2C_6, 2C_3, C_2$), and six $C_2$ axes lying in the plane of the molecule ($3C_2'$ through opposite atoms and $3C_2''$ through midpoints of opposite bonds). The order of the $D_6$ group is $2n = 2 \\times 6 = 12$. Explicitly, $|D_6| = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12$.
