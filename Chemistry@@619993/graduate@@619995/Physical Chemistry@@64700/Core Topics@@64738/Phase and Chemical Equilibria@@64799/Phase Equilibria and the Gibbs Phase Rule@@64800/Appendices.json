It is a standard problem in the thermodynamics of materials, specifically concerning phase equilibria described by a Landau-type free energy model. There are no flaws; therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the coexistence conditions for a binary alloy undergoing phase separation, starting from fundamental thermodynamic principles. Let the binary alloy consist of components $A$ and $B$. Let $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ be the number of moles of each component, respectively. The total number of moles is $n = n_{A} + n_{B}$. The mole fraction of component $A$ is $x = \\frac{n_{A}}{n_{A} + n_{B}}$, and the mole fraction of component $B$ is $1-x = \\frac{n_{B}}{n_{A} + n_{B}}$. The total Gibbs free energy of the system is $G = G(T, P, n_{A}, n_{B})$.

We must express these in terms of the molar Gibbs free energy $g(x)$.\n\nUsing $G = n \\cdot g(x)$, we apply the chain rule. For $\\mu_{A}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_{A}} \\left[ (n_{A} + n_{B}) g\\left( \\frac{n_{A}}{n_{A} + n_{B}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{A} = g(x) + (n_{A} + n_{B}) \\frac{d g}{d x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_{A}}\n$$\nThe derivative of the mole fraction $x$ with respect to $n_{A}$ at constant $n_{B}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_{A}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_{A}} \\left( \\frac{n_{A}}{n_{A} + n_{B}} \\right) = \\frac{(n_{A} + n_{B}) \\cdot 1 - n_{A} \\cdot 1}{(n_{A} + n_{B})^{2}} = \\frac{n_{B}}{(n_{A} + n_{B})^{2}} = \\frac{1-x}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mu_{A}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{A} = g(x) + n \\frac{d g}{d x} \\left( \\frac{1-x}{n} \\right) = g(x) + (1-x)\\frac{dg}{dx}\n$$\nA similar derivation for $\\mu_{B}$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_{B}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_{B}} \\left( \\frac{n_{A}}{n_{A} + n_{B}} \\right) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (n_{A} + n_{B}) - n_{A} \\cdot 1}{(n_{A} + n_{B})^{2}} = \\frac{-n_{A}}{(n_{A} + n_{B})^{2}} = \\frac{-x}{n}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{B} = g(x) + n \\frac{d g}{d x} \\left( \\frac{-x}{n} \\right) = g(x) - x\\frac{dg}{dx}\n$$\nThese are the fundamental relations for chemical potentials in a binary mixture.\n\nFor two phases, denoted $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, with compositions $x_{\\alpha}$ and $x_{\\beta}$ to coexist in equilibrium at constant $T$ and $P$, the chemical potential of each component must be equal in both phases:\n$$\n\\mu_{A}(x_{\\alpha}) = \\mu_{A}(x_{\\beta}) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{B}(x_{\\alpha}) = \\mu_{B}(x_{\\beta}) \\quad (2)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the chemical potentials into these conditions:\n$$\ng(x_{\\alpha}) + (1-x_{\\alpha})\\frac{dg}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_{\\alpha}} = g(x_{\\beta}) + (1-x_{\\beta})\\frac{dg}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_{\\beta}} \\quad (1')\n$$\n$$\ng(x_{\\alpha}) - x_{\\alpha}\\frac{dg}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_{\\alpha}} = g(x_{\\beta}) - x_{\\beta}\\frac{dg}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_{\\beta}} \\quad (2')\n$$\nLet $g'(x) = \\frac{dg}{dx}$.

Substituting this result back into equation $(2')$ gives:\n$$\ng(x_{\\alpha}) - x_{\\alpha}g'(x_{\\alpha}) = g(x_{\\beta}) - x_{\\beta}g'(x_{\\alpha})\n$$\n$$\ng(x_{\\beta}) - g(x_{\\alpha}) = (x_{\\beta} - x_{\\alpha})g'(x_{\\alpha})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_{\\alpha}} = \\frac{g(x_{\\beta}) - g(x_{\\alpha})}{x_{\\beta} - x_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nTogether, these two derived conditions, $g'(x_{\\alpha}) = g'(x_{\\beta})$ and $g'(x_{\\alpha}) = \\frac{g(x_{\\beta}) - g(x_{\\alpha})}{x_{\\beta} - x_{\\alpha}}$, represent the \"common tangent construction.\" They state that the line segment connecting the points $(x_{\\alpha}, g(x_{\\alpha}))$ and $(x_{\\beta}, g(x_{\\beta}))$ is tangent to the curve $g(x)$ at both $x=x_{\\alpha}$ and $x=x_{\\beta}$.\n\nNow we apply this to the specific free energy function provided:\n$$\ng(x) = 2(x-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{4} - \\tfrac{1}{2}(x-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{2} + g_{0}\n$$\nThis function is symmetric about $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. That is, $g(\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta) = g(\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta)$ for any $\\delta$. Due to this symmetry, the coexisting compositions must also be symmetric about $x=\\frac{1}{2}$. Let $x_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\delta$ and $x_{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\delta$ for some $\\delta > 0$.\nWith this symmetry, we have $g(x_{\\alpha}) = g(x_{\\beta})$.

These points correspond to the local minima of the $g(x)$ curve.\n\nWe find these minima by solving $g'(x) = 0$:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 2(x-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{4} - \\tfrac{1}{2}(x-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{2} + g_{0} \\right]\n$$\n$$\ng'(x) = 8(x-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{3} - (x-\\tfrac{1}{2})\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n(x-\\tfrac{1}{2}) \\left[ 8(x-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{2} - 1 \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis equation has three real roots:\n$1$. $x - \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}$. This corresponds to the local maximum between the two wells and represents an unstable state.\n$2$. $8(x-\\frac{1}{2})^{2} - 1 = 0 \\implies (x-\\frac{1}{2})^{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThis gives $(x-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\nThe two solutions corresponding to the minima are:\n$$\nx = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\n$$\nThese are the compositions of the two coexisting phases. With the condition $x_{\\alpha}  x_{\\beta}$, we have:\n$$\nx_{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{4}\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{4}\n$$\n\nFinally, we comment on the Gibbs phase rule, $F = C - P + N$. $F$ is the number of degrees of freedom, $C$ is the number of components, $P$ is the number of phases, and $N$ is the number of non-compositional intensive variables (typically $T$ and $P$, so $N=2$).\nIn this problem, $C=2$ (binary alloy A-B) and $P=2$ (two coexisting liquid phases). The general number of degrees of freedom is:\n$$\nF = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2\n$$\nThis means that to specify the thermodynamic state of the two-phase system, two independent intensive variables (e.g., $T$ and $P$) must be fixed. The problem statement specifies fixed temperature and pressure. Fixing these two variables uses up both degrees of freedom. The number of remaining degrees of freedom is $F' = F - 2 = 0$.\nA system with zero degrees of freedom is called invariant. This means that once $T$ and $P$ are specified (to be within the two-phase coexistence region), all other intensive properties of the system are fixed. This includes the compositions of the coexisting phases, $x_{\\alpha}$ and $x_{\\beta}$. Our calculation confirms this: for a given $g(x)$ (which is defined by the fixed $T$ and $P$), the pair $(x_{\\alpha}, x_{\\beta})$ is uniquely determined by the geometric condition of the common tangent, which itself provides a unique solution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{4}  \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2506894"}, {"introduction": "Once the compositions of coexisting phases are determined from a phase diagram, the next crucial step is to calculate their relative amounts for a given overall system composition.

Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data to determine the state of the system. The question is specific and asks for a calculable quantity.\n-   **Objective**: The language is quantitative and precise, free from any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Consistency Check**: At $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the phase compositions are $x_{B}^{L} = 0.35 - (2.0 \\times 10^{-4})(930-900) = 0.344$ and $x_{B}^{\\alpha} = 0.02 + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(930-900) = 0.023$. The overall alloy composition $x_{B}^{0}=0.25$ lies between the solid and liquid compositions ($0.023  0.25  0.344$), which is the condition for the existence of a two-phase equilibrium between the $\\alpha$ and liquid phases. The setup is self-consistent.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution is now constructed from the required first principles.\n\nFirst, we consider the degrees of freedom in the system using the Gibbs phase rule. For a system with $C$ components and $P$ phases, the number of degrees of freedom is $F=C-P+2$. In this binary system, the number of components is $C=2$. The pressure is fixed at $p=1\\ \\text{bar}$, which removes one degree of freedom. This leads to the condensed phase rule, $F' = C - P + 1$. In the two-phase region where liquid and solid $\\alpha$ coexist, the number of phases is $P=2$. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom is $F' = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1$. This signifies that if one intensive variable (e.g., temperature $T$) is specified, all other intensive properties of the system at equilibrium, including the compositions of the coexisting phases, are uniquely determined.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium at a given temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ is the equality of the chemical potentials of each component in all coexisting phases. For the equilibrium between the liquid ($L$) phase and the solid ($\\alpha$) phase, this requires:\n$$ \\mu_{A}^{L}(T, x_{B}^{L}) = \\mu_{A}^{\\alpha}(T, x_{B}^{\\alpha}) $$\n$$ \\mu_{B}^{L}(T, x_{B}^{L}) = \\mu_{B}^{\\alpha}(T, x_{B}^{\\alpha}) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{i}^{\\phi}$ is the chemical potential of component $i$ in phase $\\phi$. Solving this system of two equations for the two unknown compositions, $x_{B}^{L}$ and $x_{B}^{\\alpha}$, at a given $T$ yields unique values. The problem statement provides the empirical result of this fundamental condition through the given linear functions $x_{B}^{L}(T)$ and $x_{B}^{\\alpha}(T)$. These functions define the liquidus and solidus lines on the phase diagram. We use these given relations to find the compositions of the two phases at the specified temperature $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe temperature difference from the eutectic is $\\Delta T = T - T_{E} = 930\\ \\mathrm{K} - 900\\ \\mathrm{K} = 30\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nThe mole fraction of component $B$ in the liquid phase at this temperature is:\n$$ x_{B}^{L}(930\\ \\mathrm{K}) = x_{B}^{E} - m_{L}(T-T_{E}) = 0.35 - (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(30\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 0.35 - 0.006 = 0.344 $$\nThe mole fraction of component $B$ in the $\\alpha$-solid phase at this temperature is:\n$$ x_{B}^{\\alpha}(930\\ \\mathrm{K}) = x_{B}^{\\alpha,E} + m_{\\alpha}(T-T_{E}) = 0.02 + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(30\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 0.02 + 0.003 = 0.023 $$\nAs established, the overall composition $x_{B}^{0}=0.25$ lies between these two values, confirming the system is in the $L+\\alpha$ two-phase field.\n\nNext, we use the principle of mass conservation to determine the relative amounts of the two phases. Let $f^{\\alpha}$ and $f^{L}$ be the mole fractions of the $\\alpha$ and liquid phases in the mixture, respectively. By definition, the sum of the mole fractions of the phases must be unity:\n$$ f^{\\alpha} + f^{L} = 1 $$\nThe overall mole fraction of component $B$, $x_{B}^{0}$, is the weighted average of the mole fractions of $B$ in each phase, where the weights are the phase fractions. This constitutes the mass (or mole) balance for component $B$:\n$$ x_{B}^{0} = f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{\\alpha} + f^{L}x_{B}^{L} $$\nThis expression does not assume any shortcut formulas. To find the mole fraction of the $\\alpha$ phase, $f^{\\alpha}$, we eliminate $f^{L}$ using the relation $f^{L} = 1 - f^{\\alpha}$.\n$$ x_{B}^{0} = f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{\\alpha} + (1 - f^{\\alpha})x_{B}^{L} $$\nRearranging to solve for $f^{\\alpha}$:\n$$ x_{B}^{0} = f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{\\alpha} + x_{B}^{L} - f^{\\alpha}x_{B}^{L} $$\n$$ x_{B}^{0} - x_{B}^{L} = f^{\\alpha}(x_{B}^{\\alpha} - x_{B}^{L}) $$\n$$ f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{x_{B}^{0} - x_{B}^{L}}{x_{B}^{\\alpha} - x_{B}^{L}} $$\nThis can be written in the more familiar form of the lever rule:\n$$ f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{x_{B}^{L} - x_{B}^{0}}{x_{B}^{L} - x_{B}^{\\alpha}} $$\nThis derivation explicitly shows how the phase fractions are determined by mass balance once the phase compositions are uniquely fixed by temperature.\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values for the compositions at $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$: $x_{B}^{L} = 0.344$, $x_{B}^{\\alpha} = 0.023$, and the overall composition $x_{B}^{0} = 0.25$.\n$$ f^{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.344 - 0.25}{0.344 - 0.023} = \\frac{0.094}{0.321} $$\n$$ f^{\\alpha} \\approx 0.29283489... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we obtain $f^{\\alpha} = 0.2928$.\n\nRegarding the solidification pathway upon slow cooling from $T=930\\ \\mathrm{K}$ toward $T_{E}$, the system evolves while maintaining equilibrium. As the temperature decreases, the equilibrium compositions of the liquid and solid phases change according to the given functions. The liquid composition $x_{B}^{L}(T)$ increases toward the eutectic composition $x_{B}^{E}=0.35$. The solid composition $x_{B}^{\\alpha}(T)$ decreases toward $x_{B}^{\\alpha,E}=0.02$. Consequently, as the alloy cools, more of the $\\alpha$ phase precipitates from the liquid. The fraction of solid, $f^{\\alpha}$, continuously increases. At any temperature $T$ in the interval $(T_{E}, 930\\ \\mathrm{K}]$, the compositions of the phases and their relative amounts are determined by the tie-line at that temperature and the lever rule. This process continues until the temperature reaches $T_{E}$. At this point, the remaining liquid has reached the eutectic composition $x_{B}^{E}$, and it will subsequently undergo the eutectic reaction, transforming into a fine mixture of solid $\\alpha$ and solid $\\beta$ phases at constant temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2928}$$", "id": "2506917"}, {"introduction": "The true power of the Gibbs phase rule lies not in the familiar formula, $F=C-P+2$, but in the method of its derivation: a careful accounting of a system's variables and the constraints imposed by thermodynamic equilibrium.

It is free of contradictions or ambiguities and represents a standard problem in the thermodynamics of ionic systems. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the number of independent composition variables in a single phase and the reduction in the total thermodynamic degrees of freedom, $F$, for the specified ionic system relative to a neutral one. We will address each part by a systematic enumeration of variables and constraints based on the provided thermodynamic definitions.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of independent composition variables in a single phase. Let us consider a single phase $\\alpha$. The composition of this phase is described by a set of $C$ mole fractions, $\\{x_{i}^{(\\alpha)}\\}_{i=1}^{C}$. These variables are not fully independent; they are subject to two linear constraints as specified in the problem statement.\n\n1.  The sum of mole fractions must equal one. This is a definitional requirement for mole fractions:\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_{i}^{(\\alpha)} = 1 $$\n2.  Each macroscopic phase must be locally electroneutral. This imposes a constraint on the mole fractions weighted by the integer charges $z_{i}$ of the ionic species:\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{C} z_{i} x_{i}^{(\\alpha)} = 0 $$\n\nThese two equations represent two independent constraints on the $C$ composition variables. The constraints are independent because the vector of charges $\\{z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_C\\}$ is not a scalar multiple of the vector $\\{1, 1, \\dots, 1\\}$ for any genuine ionic system (which must contain ions of both positive and negative charge).\n\nThe number of independent composition variables is therefore the total number of variables minus the number of independent constraints. For a single phase, this is:\n$$ \\text{Number of independent variables} = C - 2 $$\nThis result is valid for $C \\ge 2$, which is implicit in the definition of a multicomponent ionic melt. A single-component system ($C=1$) cannot satisfy electroneutrality unless its charge is zero, in which case it is not an ionic species. A system with two species ($C=2$) has $2-2=0$ independent composition variables; its composition is uniquely fixed by the charge neutrality condition.\n\nSecond, we determine the quantitative reduction in the thermodynamic degrees of freedom, $F$, for the ionic system compared to a non-ionic (neutral) system with the same number of components $C$ and phases $P$. The number of degrees of freedom is calculated using the Gibbsian method: $F = (\\text{Number of Variables}) - (\\text{Number of Constraints})$.\n\nLet us first analyze the reference case: a neutral mixture of $C$ components in $P$ phases.\n-   **Variables**: The state of the system is described by temperature $T$, pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, and the compositions of each of the $P$ phases. For each phase $\\alpha$, there are $C$ mole fractions $x_{i}^{(\\alpha)}$.\n    The total number of variables is $2 + C P$.\n-   **Constraints**:\n    1.  In each of the $P$ phases, the sum of mole fractions is unity: $\\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_{i}^{(\\alpha)} = 1$. This gives $P$ constraints.\n    2.  At equilibrium, for each of the $C$ components, the chemical potential $\\mu_i$ must be equal across all $P$ phases: $\\mu_{i}^{(1)} = \\mu_{i}^{(2)} = \\dots = \\mu_{i}^{(P)}$. This provides $C(P-1)$ independent equations.\n    The total number of constraints is $P + C(P-1)$.\n-   **Degrees of Freedom ($F_{\\text{neutral}}$)**:\n    $$ F_{\\text{neutral}} = (2 + CP) - (P + C(P-1)) = 2 + CP - P - CP + C = C - P + 2 $$\nThis is the standard Gibbs phase rule.\n\nNow, we analyze the ionic system as described in the problem.\n-   **Variables**: In addition to temperature, pressure, and compositions, the state variables must include the electric potential $\\phi^{(\\alpha)}$ of each phase, as the electrochemical potential depends on it.\n    -   $T, P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$: $2$ variables.\n    -   Mole fractions $x_{i}^{(\\alpha)}$: $CP$ variables.\n    -   Electric potentials $\\phi^{(\\alpha)}$: $P$ variables.\n    The total number of variables is $2 + CP + P$.\n-   **Constraints**:\n    1.  Sum of mole fractions in each phase: $P$ constraints ($\\sum x_{i}^{(\\alpha)} = 1$).\n    2.  Electroneutrality in each phase: $P$ constraints ($\\sum z_{i} x_{i}^{(\\alpha)} = 0$).\n    3.  Equilibrium of electrochemical potentials $\\tilde{\\mu}_{i}^{(\\alpha)} = \\mu_{i}^{(\\alpha)} + z_{i}F_{\\text{Faraday}}\\phi^{(\\alpha)}$. For each component $i$, we have $\\tilde{\\mu}_{i}^{(1)} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{i}^{(2)} = \\dots = \\tilde{\\mu}_{i}^{(P)}$. This gives $C(P-1)$ constraints.\n    4.  Arbitrary potential reference: As stated, only potential differences are thermodynamically meaningful. We can set the potential of one phase to a reference value (e.g., $\\phi^{(1)} = 0$) without loss of generality. This imposes $1$ constraint.\n    The total number of constraints is $P + P + C(P-1) + 1 = 2P + C(P-1) + 1$.\n-   **Degrees of Freedom ($F_{\\text{ionic}}$)**:\n    $$ F_{\\text{ionic}} = (2 + CP + P) - (2P + C(P-1) + 1) $$\n    $$ F_{\\text{ionic}} = 2 + CP + P - 2P - CP + C - 1 $$\n    $$ F_{\\text{ionic}} = C - P + 1 $$\nThis is the modified phase rule for the specified ionic system.\n\nThe reduction in the number of degrees of freedom is the difference between the neutral and ionic cases:\n$$ \\text{Reduction} = F_{\\text{neutral}} - F_{\\text{ionic}} = (C - P + 2) - (C - P + 1) = 1 $$\nThe presence of ionic species and the attendant constraints of electroneutrality effectively reduce the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom by precisely one, compared to a neutral system with the same number of species and phases. This reduction arises because the introduction of $P$ electroneutrality constraints and $1$ constraint for the potential reference outweighs the introduction of $P$ new electric potential variables. The net change is $(P) - (P+1) = -1$ degree of freedom.\n\nThe two results are therefore $C-2$ for the number of independent composition variables per phase, and $1$ for the reduction in degrees of freedom.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} C - 2  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2506950"}]}
