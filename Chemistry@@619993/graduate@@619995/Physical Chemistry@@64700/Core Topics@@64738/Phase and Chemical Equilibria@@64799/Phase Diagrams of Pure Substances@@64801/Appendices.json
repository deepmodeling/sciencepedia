It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objectively formulated. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: a derivation of the working equation, a numerical calculation of the molar enthalpy of vaporization, and a qualitative discussion of deviations from the idealized model.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the slope of a plot of $y = \\ln(P/P^{\\circ})$ versus $x = 1/T$ and the molar enthalpy of vaporization, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$. We begin with the Clapeyron equation, which governs the phase coexistence curve between two phases $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta S_m}{\\Delta V_m} = \\frac{S_{m,\\beta} - S_{m,\\alpha}}{V_{m,\\beta} - V_{m,\\alpha}}\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the molar Gibbs free energy change is zero, $\\Delta G_m = \\Delta H_m - T\\Delta S_m = 0$, which implies $\\Delta S_m = \\Delta H_m / T$. Substituting this into the Clapeyron equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_m}{T \\Delta V_m}\n$$\nFor the liquid($l$)–vapor($g$) equilibrium, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{T (V_{m,g} - V_{m,l})}\n$$\nWe introduce two standard assumptions for a system away from the critical point. First, the molar volume of the liquid is negligible compared to the molar volume of the gas, $V_{m,l} \\ll V_{m,g}$, so $\\Delta V_m \\approx V_{m,g}$. Second, the vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas, for which the molar volume is given by the Ideal Gas Law: $V_{m,g} = RT/P$.\nSubstituting these approximations yields the Clausius–Clapeyron equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{T (RT/P)} = \\frac{P \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to $\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}$. Recognizing that $d(\\ln P) = (1/P)dP$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a plot of $y = \\ln(P/P^{\\circ})$ versus $x = 1/T$. We seek the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. Using the chain rule for derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d(\\ln(P/P^{\\circ}))}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d(\\ln P - \\ln P^{\\circ})}{d(1/T)}\n$$\nSince $P^{\\circ}$ is a constant, $d(\\ln P^{\\circ}) = 0$. Thus, we need to evaluate $\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{d(1/T)}$. We use the chain rule again:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} \\cdot \\frac{dT}{d(1/T)}\n$$\nWe have $\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}$. For the second term, since $x=1/T$, we have $T=1/x$, and $\\frac{dT}{dx} = -1/x^2 = -T^2$.\nCombining these results:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}\\right) (-T^2) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}\n$$\nThis derivation shows that under the stated assumptions and the additional assumption that $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ is constant over the temperature range, a plot of $\\ln(P/P^{\\circ})$ versus $1/T$ is a straight line with a slope $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the numerical value of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ using the first four data points. These points $(x,y)$ are $(1/T, \\ln(P/P^{\\circ}))$.\nThe points are:\n$P_1 = (0.0031250000, -3.1250000)$, which corresponds to $(1/320, -25/8)$.\n$P_2 = (0.0030303030, -2.7272727)$, which corresponds to $(1/330, -30/11)$.\n$P_3 = (0.0029411765, -2.3529412)$, which corresponds to $(1/340, -40/17)$.\n$P_4 = (0.0028571429, -2.0000000)$, which corresponds to $(1/350, -2)$.\nWe compute the slope $m = \\Delta y / \\Delta x$ between any two of these points. Using points $P_1$ and $P_4$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_4 - y_1}{x_4 - x_1} = \\frac{-2 - (-3.125)}{0.0028571429 - 0.0031250000} = \\frac{1.125}{-0.0002678571} = -4200\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe calculation using the exact fractional forms confirms this slope is exact for all pairs among the first four points.\nFrom the derived relation $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}$, we solve for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = -mR\n$$\nSubstituting the values for the slope $m$ and the universal gas constant $R$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = -(-4200\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times (8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 34920.743\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 34.920743\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} \\approx 34.92\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\n\nThird, we discuss the reasons for the deviation of the two highest-temperature data points from the linear trend. The linear relationship $y = mx + c$ relies on three key assumptions: $V_{m,l} \\ll V_{m,g}$, the vapor is an ideal gas ($Z=PV/(RT)=1$), and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ is constant with temperature. As temperature increases along the coexistence curve, these assumptions become progressively less valid.\n\nThe observed data shows that the points for higher temperatures lie above the extrapolated line from the low-temperature data. This indicates an upward curvature of the plot of $\\ln P$ vs $1/T$, which means the magnitude of the negative slope, $|m|$, decreases as temperature $T$ increases (and $1/T$ decreases).\n\nThe slope is more accurately given by the expression $\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{d(1/T)} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{Z R (1 - V_{m,l}/V_{m,g})}$. The deviation from linearity arises from the temperature dependence of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$, the compression factor $Z$, and the liquid-to-gas volume ratio $V_{m,l}/V_{m,g}$.\n\n1.  **Temperature dependence of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$**: This is the principal cause of deviation. The enthalpy of vaporization is not constant; it decreases as temperature increases, eventually becoming zero at the critical point. According to Kirchhoff's law, $\\frac{d(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}})}{dT} = \\Delta C_p = C_{p, \\text{gas}} - C_{p, \\text{liquid}}$. For most substances, $C_{p, \\text{liquid}} > C_{p, \\text{gas}}$, so $\\Delta C_p$ is negative, causing $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ to decrease with increasing $T$. A decrease in $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ leads to a decrease in the slope's magnitude, causing the plot to curve upwards. This is consistent with the observed deviation.\n\n2.  **Real-gas effects ($Z \\neq 1$)**: At higher temperatures and pressures, the vapor deviates from ideal-gas behavior. For pressures that are not extreme, attractive intermolecular forces often dominate, leading to a compression factor $Z1$. This would make the denominator $Z R$ smaller and the slope magnitude $|m|$ larger, causing a downward curvature, opposite to the observed trend.\n\n3.  **Non-negligible liquid volume**: As temperature approaches the critical temperature, the molar volume of the liquid $V_{m,l}$ increases while that of the gas $V_{m,g}$ decreases. The term $(1 - V_{m,l}/V_{m,g})$ becomes significantly less than $1$. This makes the denominator smaller and the slope magnitude $|m|$ larger, also contributing to a downward curvature.\n\nThe observed upward deviation of the data points from the linear model indicates that the effect of the decreasing $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ with temperature is dominant over the opposing effects of real gas behavior and non-negligible liquid volume in this particular temperature and pressure regime.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{34.92}\n$$", "id": "2951265"}, {"introduction": "While the Clausius-Clapeyron equation describes the equilibrium coexistence curve, it doesn't explain the underlying behavior of the fluid across different densities.

The vdW equation is given as:\n$$\np = \\frac{R T}{v - b} - \\frac{a}{v^{2}}\n$$\nThe reduced variables are defined by the relations $p = p_r p_c$, $v = v_r v_c$, and $T = T_r T_c$. Substituting these into the vdW equation yields:\n$$\np_r p_c = \\frac{R (T_r T_c)}{v_r v_c - b} - \\frac{a}{(v_r v_c)^{2}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for the critical parameters $p_c = \\frac{a}{27b^2}$, $v_c = 3b$, and $T_c = \\frac{8a}{27Rb}$:\n$$\np_r \\left(\\frac{a}{27b^2}\\right) = \\frac{R T_r \\left(\\frac{8a}{27Rb}\\right)}{v_r (3b) - b} - \\frac{a}{(v_r (3b))^{2}}\n$$\nSimplifying the terms, we have:\n$$\np_r \\frac{a}{27b^2} = \\frac{T_r \\frac{8a}{27b}}{b(3v_r - 1)} - \\frac{a}{9b^2 v_r^2}\n$$\nTo isolate $p_r$, we divide the entire equation by the factor $\\frac{a}{27b^2}$:\n$$\np_r = \\left(\\frac{T_r \\frac{8a}{27b}}{b(3v_r - 1)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{27b^2}{a}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a}{9b^2 v_r^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{27b^2}{a}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_r = \\frac{8 T_r}{3v_r - 1} - \\frac{3}{v_r^2}\n$$\nThis is the renowned reduced van der Waals equation of state. Its form is universal, independent of the substance-specific parameters $a$ and $b$.\n\nNext, we identify the spinodal curve, which is the locus of points where the fluid becomes mechanically unstable. This condition is defined by the vanishing of the isothermal derivative of pressure with respect to volume at constant temperature:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v}\\right)_{T} = 0\n$$\nIn reduced variables, this condition becomes $\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial v_r}\\right)_{T_r} = 0$. We compute this derivative from the reduced EOS:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial v_r}\\right)_{T_r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_r} \\left(\\frac{8 T_r}{3v_r - 1} - \\frac{3}{v_r^2}\\right) = -\\frac{8 T_r \\cdot 3}{(3v_r - 1)^2} - (-2)\\frac{3}{v_r^3} = -\\frac{24 T_r}{(3v_r - 1)^2} + \\frac{6}{v_r^3}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the equation for the spinodal curve:\n$$\n\\frac{24 T_r}{(3v_r - 1)^2} = \\frac{6}{v_r^3} \\implies 4 T_r v_r^3 = (3v_r - 1)^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies a reduced temperature $T_r = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value, we obtain a specific equation for the spinodal volumes at this temperature:\n$$\n4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) v_r^3 = (3v_r - 1)^2 \\implies 2 v_r^3 = 9v_r^2 - 6v_r + 1\n$$\nThis is a cubic equation for $v_r$:\n$$\n2v_r^3 - 9v_r^2 + 6v_r - 1 = 0\n$$\nBy inspection, one can test for simple roots. For $v_r = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 - 9\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1 = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) - 9\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + 3 - 1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{9}{4} + 2 = -\\frac{8}{4} + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0\n$$\nThus, $v_r = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root. We can factor the cubic polynomial by dividing by $(2v_r - 1)$:\n$$\n(2v_r - 1)(v_r^2 - 4v_r + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe remaining roots are found by solving the quadratic equation $v_r^2 - 4v_r + 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nv_r = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}\n$$\nThe three mathematical roots are $v_r = \\frac{1}{2}$, $v_r = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$, and $v_r = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$. However, the molar volume $v$ must be greater than the excluded volume $b$, which is a fundamental constraint of the vdW model. In reduced variables, this means $v_r v_c  b$, or $v_r(3b)  b$, which simplifies to $v_r  \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe must check our roots against this physical constraint:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $v_r = 2 - \\sqrt{3} \\approx 2 - 1.732 = 0.268$. This root is less than $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$ and is therefore physically inadmissible.\n    \\item $v_r = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$. This root is greater than $\\frac{1}{3}$ and is physically valid.\n    \\item $v_r = 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\approx 2 + 1.732 = 3.732$. This root is also greater than $\\frac{1}{3}$ and is physically valid.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe two reduced spinodal molar volumes are thus $v_r = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $v_r = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$. By convention, the smaller volume is denoted $v_r^{-}$ and the larger is $v_r^{+}$.\nHence, $v_r^{-} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $v_r^{+} = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an explanation for why the reduced coexistence volumes for the liquid, $v_{r,\\ell}$, and gas, $v_{r,g}$, must satisfy $v_{r,\\ell}  v_{r}^{-}$ and $v_{r,g}  v_{r}^{+}$. This argument must be based on the sign of the isothermal compressibility and the structure of the Maxwell construction, without explicit calculation of $v_{r,\\ell}$ and $v_{r,g}$.\nThe isothermal compressibility, $\\kappa_T = -\\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial p}\\right)_T$, must be positive for a substance in a thermodynamically stable or metastable state. This condition of mechanical stability, $\\kappa_T  0$, is equivalent to $\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v}\\right)_T  0$.\nThe spinodal region is defined by $\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v}\\right)_T  0$, where the system is mechanically unstable and homogeneous phases cannot exist. The boundaries of this region are the spinodal points, $v_r^{-}$ and $v_r^{+}$, where $\\left(\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial v_r}\\right)_{T_r} = 0$.\nThe saturated liquid state $(p_{r,sat}, v_{r,\\ell})$ and the saturated vapor state $(p_{r,sat}, v_{r,g})$ are, by definition, states of stable thermodynamic equilibrium. Consequently, they must reside in regions of mechanical stability. This requires that they lie outside the spinodal interval $[v_r^{-}, v_r^{+}]$. Therefore, we must have $v_{r,\\ell} \\le v_r^{-}$ and $v_{r,g} \\ge v_r^{+}$.\nThe strict inequality is a consequence of the Maxwell equal-area construction. The construction equates the integral of the vdW isotherm from $v_{r,\\ell}$ to $v_{r,g}$ with the area of the rectangle formed by the saturation pressure $p_{r,sat}$ and the volumes $v_{r,\\ell}$ and $v_{r,g}$. This implies that the saturation pressure line must cut the vdW loop such that the area of the lobe above $p_{r,sat}$ is equal to the area of the lobe below it. For any temperature $T_r  1$, the vdW isotherm has a local maximum pressure at $v_r^{-}$ and a local minimum pressure at $v_r^{+}$. The equal-area construction is only possible if the saturation pressure $p_{r,sat}$ is strictly between these two extrema: $p_r(v_r^{+})  p_{r,sat}  p_r(v_r^{-})$.\nIf $v_{r,\\ell}$ were equal to $v_r^{-}$, then $p_{r,sat}$ would have to be $p_r(v_r^{-})$. At this pressure, the area of the lobe above the isobar is zero, while the area below it is strictly positive, which violates the Maxwell condition. A symmetrical argument shows that if $v_{r,g}$ were equal to $v_r^{+}$, the equal-area condition would also be violated. Therefore, the inequalities must be strict: $v_{r,\\ell}  v_r^{-}$ and $v_{r,g}  v_r^{+}$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the exact product of the two spinodal volumes, $v_r^{-} v_r^{+}$. Using the values we determined:\n$$\nv_{r}^{-} v_{r}^{+} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the exact analytical result required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$", "id": "2659684"}, {"introduction": "To capture the universal behavior of systems near a critical point, we turn to more general theoretical frameworks like Landau theory.

Consequently, the coexisting phases will be symmetric, with $\\phi_1 = -\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and $\\phi_2 = +\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\nThe first derivative is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = a\\tau\\phi + b\\phi^3$.\nThe common tangent slope condition is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi}\\bigg|_{\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}} = \\frac{f(\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}) - f(-\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}})}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}} - (-\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}})}$.\nDue to the even symmetry of $f(\\phi)$, we have $f(\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}) = f(-\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}})$, which means the numerator is zero. Therefore, the common tangent has zero slope:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi}\\bigg|_{\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}} = 0\n$$\nThis signifies that for a symmetric potential, the binodal points correspond to the minima of the free energy density. We solve for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}$:\n$$\na\\tau\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}} + b\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^{3} = 0\n$$\nThis equation has solutions $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}^2 = -\\frac{a\\tau}{b}$. For $\\tau  0$, we are below the critical temperature, and non-trivial solutions representing the two-phase region exist. Since $a  0$ and $b  0$, $-\\tau  0$, so the term $-\\frac{a\\tau}{b}$ is positive.\nThe binodal values are therefore:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}(\\tau) = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{a\\tau}{b}}\n$$\n\n**2) Determination of the spinodal values $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\tau)$**\n\nThe spinodal curve marks the limit of local thermodynamic stability of a homogeneous phase. A phase is locally stable against small fluctuations in the order parameter if the free energy is locally convex. The condition for convexity is a non-negative second derivative. The limit of stability is reached when the curvature of the free energy density becomes zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial \\phi^{2}}\\bigg|_{\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}} = 0\n$$\nWe compute the second derivative of $f(\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial \\phi^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left( a\\tau\\phi + b\\phi^3 \\right) = a\\tau + 3b\\phi^2\n$$\nSetting this to zero to find the spinodal points $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\na\\tau + 3b\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}^{2} = -\\frac{a\\tau}{3b}\n$$\nFor $\\tau  0$, the right side is positive. The spinodal values are:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\tau) = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{a\\tau}{3b}}\n$$\n\n**3) Calculation of the coefficient $K$**\n\nWe are asked to find the separation $\\Delta\\phi(\\tau) \\equiv \\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}(\\tau) - \\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\tau)$ for the branches where $\\phi  0$.\nUsing the positive roots derived above:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{b}}(\\tau) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a\\tau}{b}}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\tau) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a\\tau}{3b}}\n$$\nThe separation is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi(\\tau) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a\\tau}{b}} - \\sqrt{-\\frac{a\\tau}{3b}}\n$$\nWe can factor out the dependence on $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi(\\tau) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\\sqrt{-\\tau} - \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{3b}}\\sqrt{-\\tau} = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} \\right) \\sqrt{-\\tau}\n$$\nThis can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi(\\tau) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} \\sqrt{-\\tau}\n$$\nThis result shows that the separation $\\Delta\\phi(\\tau)$ is directly proportional to $\\sqrt{-\\tau}$. The problem states this as an asymptotic scaling $\\Delta\\phi(\\tau) \\sim K\\,\\sqrt{-\\tau}$. Within this mean-field model, the relation is exact for all $\\tau  0$, not just an asymptotic limit. The coefficient of proportionality, $K$, is therefore:\n$$\nK = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\n$$\nThis expression is the final required result, given in closed form in terms of the model parameters $a$ and $b$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}}\n$$", "id": "2659672"}]}
