The activities, $a_i$, are themselves functions of temperature, meaning the reaction quotient $Q$ varies with temperature. This introduces an additional term into the temperature coefficient of the potential.\nThe entropy is derived from $\\Delta S = nF\\left(\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = nF \\left( \\frac{\\partial E^\\circ}{\\partial T} \\right)_P - R\\ln Q - RT\\frac{d(\\ln Q)}{dT}$. Our calculation effectively extracts an apparent entropy, $\\Delta S_{exp}$, which is biased from the standard entropy, $\\Delta S^\\circ = nF \\left( \\frac{\\partial E^\\circ}{\\partial T} \\right)_P$, by the terms $-R\\ln Q$ and $-RT\\frac{d(\\ln Q)}{dT}$.\nSimilarly, the extracted enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{exp} = \\Delta G_{exp} + T\\Delta S_{exp}$, will be biased from the standard enthalpy, $\\Delta H^\\circ$. The enthalpy deviation is given by $\\Delta H_{exp} - \\Delta H^\\circ = -RT^2 \\frac{d(\\ln Q)}{dT}$. The temperature dependence of the activities is related to the partial molar enthalpies of the ions. The bias is therefore related to the difference in the relative partial molar enthalpies of the reactant and product ions, $\\Delta H_{exp} - \\Delta H^\\circ = (\\bar{H}_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}} - H^\\circ_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}}) - (\\bar{H}_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}} - H^\\circ_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}})$. The direction of the bias on $\\Delta S$ and $\\Delta H$ would depend on the specific temperature dependencies of the activities of $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ and $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$ in the given electrolyte solution, which cannot be determined without more information.

This relation forms the basis of our entire analysis. All potentials are calculated with respect to the vacuum level unless specified otherwise.\n\nFirst, we determine the standard absolute reduction potential, $E_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\circ}$. This requires the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction in solution, with the electron taken from the vacuum level. This energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{vac}}^{\\circ}$, is constructed using a thermodynamic cycle that connects gas-phase species to solvated species. The cycle is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{vac}}^{\\circ} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Red}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Ox}) $$\nHere, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\circ}$ is the reaction free energy for $\\mathrm{Ox}(\\mathrm{g}) + n\\,e^-(\\mathrm{vac}) \\to \\mathrm{Red}(\\mathrm{g})$, and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(i)$ is the free energy of solvation for species $i$. All free energy values are provided in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ and must be converted to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ by multiplying by $1000$. The standard absolute potential is then:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\circ} = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{vac}}^{\\circ}}{n F} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the standard reduction potential relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), $E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}^{\\circ}$. This is a simple shift of the potential scale from the absolute vacuum reference to the SHE reference:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}^{\\circ} = E_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\circ} - E_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} $$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}}$ is the given absolute potential of the SHE.\n\nThird, we compute the potential under non-standard conditions, $E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}$. The chemical potential $\\mu_i$ of a species $i$ depends on its activity $a_i$ as $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + R T \\ln a_i$, where $R$ is the gas constant, $R=8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. This leads to the Nernst equation for the absolute potential:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{abs}} = E_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\circ} - \\frac{R T}{n F} \\ln Q $$\nwhere $Q$ is the reaction quotient, $Q = a_{\\mathrm{Red}}/a_{\\mathrm{Ox}}$. Using the ideal-solution approximation, we replace activities $a_i$ with molar concentrations $c_i$. The potential relative to SHE is then:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}} = E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}^{\\circ} - \\frac{R T}{n F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{Red}}}{c_{\\mathrm{Ox}}} \\right) $$\n\nFourth, we evaluate a heuristic quantity, the initial driving difference $D_{\\mathrm{initial}}$, between the redox couple and a metal surface. Under the rigid-work-function approximation, this is defined as the difference between the standard absolute potential of the couple and the metal's work function, $\\Phi$:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{initial}} = E_{\\mathrm{abs}}^{\\circ} - \\Phi $$\nThe work function $\\Phi$, given in electronvolts, is treated numerically as an equivalent potential in volts for this calculation.\n\nFifth, we perform an uncertainty analysis to identify the dominant source of error in the calculated $E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}^{\\circ}$. The total variance of a function $f(x_1, x_2, \\dots)$ with independent variables $x_i$ is given by the sum of squared contributions: $u(f)^2 = \\sum_i (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} u(x_i))^2$. Our target quantity is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}^{\\circ} = -\\frac{1}{n F}\\left(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\circ} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Red}) - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Ox})\\right) - E_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}} $$\nThe individual uncertainty contributions from the four specified sources are determined by the magnitude of the term $|\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{vsSHE}}^{\\circ}}{\\partial x_i} u(x_i)|$.\nThe four input uncertainties are $u_{\\mathrm{gas}}$, $u_{\\mathrm{solv,Red}}$, $u_{\\mathrm{solv,Ox}}$ (all in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$) and $u_{\\mathrm{SHE}}$ (in $\\mathrm{V}$).\nThe contributions are calculated as follows, after converting free energy uncertainties to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n1.  From $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\circ}$: $\\text{contrib}_1 = \\left| \\frac{-1}{nF} \\right| (u_{\\mathrm{gas}} \\times 1000) = \\frac{1000 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{gas}}}{nF}$\n2.  From $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Red})$: $\\text{contrib}_2 = \\left| \\frac{-1}{nF} \\right| (u_{\\mathrm{solv,Red}} \\times 1000) = \\frac{1000 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{solv,Red}}}{nF}$\n3.  From $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\mathrm{Ox})$: $\\text{contrib}_3 = \\left| \\frac{+1}{nF} \\right| (u_{\\mathrm{solv,Ox}} \\times 1000) = \\frac{1000 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{solv,Ox}}}{nF}$\n4.  From $E_{\\mathrm{SHE}}^{\\mathrm{abs}}$: $\\text{contrib}_4 = \\left| -1 \\right| u_{\\mathrm{SHE}} = u_{\\mathrm{SHE}}$\n\nThe dominant error index is the index ($1, 2, 3,$ or $4$) corresponding to the maximum of these four values.
