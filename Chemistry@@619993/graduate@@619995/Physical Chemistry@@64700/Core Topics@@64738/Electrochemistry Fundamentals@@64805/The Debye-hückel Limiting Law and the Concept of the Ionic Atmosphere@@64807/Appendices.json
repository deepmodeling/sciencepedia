Treat each ion as a point charge in a dielectric continuum of absolute permittivity $\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{r}\\epsilon_{0}$, where $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the absolute vacuum permittivity. Assume that the electrostatic potential created by the ionic atmosphere is small compared to $k_{B}T/e$, so that linear response applies.

All necessary definitions, conditions, and assumptions are provided, and the problem is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds by following the structured steps outlined in the problem.\n\nThe analysis begins with two fundamental equations. The first is the Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ to the local charge density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$ is the absolute permittivity of the solvent. The local charge density is the sum over all mobile ionic species $i$:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $z_i$ is the valence of ion $i$, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $n_i(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local number density of ion $i$.\n\nThe second fundamental relation is the Boltzmann distribution, which connects the local number density $n_i(\\mathbf{r})$ to the bulk number density $n_i^0$ and the local electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\nn_i(\\mathbf{r}) = n_i^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n**1) Derivation of the Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann Equation and Debye Parameter $\\kappa$**\n\nWe substitute the Boltzmann distribution into the expression for the charge density:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the potential is small, $|z_i e \\phi| \\ll k_B T$. This permits the linearization of the exponential function, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$. Applying this approximation:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 \\left(1 - \\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 - \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{n_i^0 z_i^2 e^2}{k_B T}\\right) \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe first term, $\\sum_i z_i e n_i^0$, represents the net charge density of the bulk solution, which must be zero due to the principle of electroneutrality.

Thus:\n$$\n\\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2 = 2 I N_A \\times 10^3\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_B T} (2 I N_A \\times 10^3) = \\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T} I\n$$\nThe Debye screening parameter $\\kappa$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T} I}\n$$\n\n**2) Potential, Excess Chemical Potential, and Activity Coefficient**\n\nFor a central ion of charge $q = z_0 e$ at the origin, the potential is spherically symmetric, $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi(r)$.

First, the potential must vanish at infinity, $\\phi(r \\to \\infty) = 0$, which requires $C_2 = 0$. Second, as $r \\to 0$, the potential must approach that of the bare central ion in the dielectric continuum, $\\phi(r) \\to \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon r}$. For small $r$, the solution behaves as $\\phi(r) \\approx C_1/r$. Comparing these determines the constant $C_1 = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon}$. The potential is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi(r) = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r)}{r}\n$$\nThis total potential can be separated into the potential of the bare ion, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{ion}}(r) = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon r}$, and the potential due to the ionic atmosphere, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(r)$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(r) = \\phi(r) - \\phi_{\\mathrm{ion}}(r) = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon r} (\\exp(-\\kappa r) - 1)\n$$\nThe excess chemical potential $\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ is the work done to charge the ion in the presence of its ionic atmosphere. This work is found by a reversible (Gibbs) charging process. The potential at the location of the central ion ($r=0$) created by its own atmosphere is found by taking the limit of $\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(r)$ as $r \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(0) = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa r) - 1}{r} = \\frac{z_0 e}{4\\pi\\epsilon} (-\\kappa) = -\\frac{z_0 e \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe work done, $W$, to charge an ion of type $i$ from a charge of $0$ to its final charge $z_i e$ is calculated by integrating the electrostatic work. At an intermediate charge $\\lambda z_i e$ (with $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$), the potential of the atmosphere is $-\\frac{(\\lambda z_i e) \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon}$. The incremental work to add charge $d q = (z_i e)d\\lambda$ is $dW = \\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(0) d q$.\n$$\n\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}} = W = \\int_0^1 \\left(-\\frac{\\lambda z_i e \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon}\\right) (z_i e \\, d\\lambda) = -\\frac{(z_i e)^2 \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\int_0^1 \\lambda \\, d\\lambda = -\\frac{(z_i e)^2 \\kappa}{4\\pi\\epsilon} \\left[\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}\\right]_0^1\n$$\nThis yields the excess chemical potential:\n$$\n\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}} = -\\frac{z_i^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ is related to the excess chemical potential by $\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}} = k_B T \\ln \\gamma_i$. Thus:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_i = \\frac{\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}}{k_B T} = -\\frac{z_i^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\n\n**3) Mean Activity Coefficient and the Limiting-Law Constant $A$**\n\nFor an electrolyte $M_{\\nu_+}X_{\\nu_-}$, the mean activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ is defined by $\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\nu_+ + \\nu_-} = \\gamma_+^{\\nu_+} \\gamma_-^{\\nu_-}$. For a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte, $\\nu_+ = 1$, $\\nu_- = 1$, $z_+ = 1$, and $z_- = -1$. The definition becomes $\\gamma_{\\pm}^2 = \\gamma_+ \\gamma_-$. Taking the natural logarithm: $2 \\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\ln \\gamma_+ + \\ln \\gamma_-$.\nUsing the result from part 2:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_+ = -\\frac{(+1)^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_- = -\\frac{(-1)^2 e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\nSumming these gives:\n$$\n2 \\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -2\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\kappa$ in terms of ionic strength $I$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -\\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T} I} = -\\left( \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T}} \\right) \\sqrt{I}\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -A\\sqrt{I}$. The constant of proportionality, $A$, is identified as:\n$$\nA = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 N_A e^2 \\times 10^3}{\\epsilon k_B T}} = \\frac{e^3 \\sqrt{2N_A \\times 10^3}}{8\\pi (\\epsilon k_B T)^{3/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$, we obtain the explicit expression for $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{e^3 \\sqrt{2N_A \\times 10^3}}{8\\pi (\\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r k_B T)^{3/2}}\n$$\n\n**4) Ratio of Mean Activity Coefficients**\n\nWe are given the limiting-law relationship $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm} = -A\\sqrt{I}$, which holds for low ionic strength. We need to compute the ratio $\\gamma_{\\pm}(4I) / \\gamma_{\\pm}(I)$.\nFirst, we write the expression for $\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}$ for each ionic strength:\nFor ionic strength $I$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}(I) = -A\\sqrt{I}\n$$\nFor ionic strength $4I$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{\\pm}(4I) = -A\\sqrt{4I} = -A(2\\sqrt{I}) = -2A\\sqrt{I}\n$$\nTo find the ratio of the activity coefficients, we exponentiate these expressions:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\pm}(I) = \\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\pm}(4I) = \\exp(-2A\\sqrt{I})\n$$\nThe ratio is then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma_{\\pm}(4I)}{\\gamma_{\\pm}(I)} = \\frac{\\exp(-2A\\sqrt{I})}{\\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})} = \\exp(-2A\\sqrt{I} - (-A\\sqrt{I})) = \\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the ratio in terms of $A$ and $I$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(-A\\sqrt{I})}\n$$", "id": "2673299"}, {"introduction": "A powerful test of any scientific model is its ability to make quantitative predictions that can be experimentally verified.

The problem allows the use of molality $m_i$ for concentration $c_i$.\nFor the $1{:}1$ electrolyte:\n$$\nI_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{11}(+1)^2 + m_{11}(-1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (m_{11} + m_{11}) = m_{11} = 0.0100\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}\n$$\nFor the $2{:}1$ electrolyte, dissociation gives one ion of charge $+2$ and two ions of charge $-1$, so $m_+ = m_{21}$ and $m_- = 2m_{21}$.\n$$\nI_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{21}(+2)^2 + (2m_{21})(-1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} (4m_{21} + 2m_{21}) = 3m_{21}\n$$\n$$\nI_{21} = 3 \\times (3.333 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}) = 0.009999\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg}^{-1}\n$$\nThe ionic strengths are indeed matched to a high degree of precision ($I_{11} = 0.0100$ and $I_{21} = 0.009999$). We will use these calculated values.\n\nNext, we calculate $S_{\\pm}$ for each electrolyte using the definition $S_{\\pm} = -\\frac{\\log_{10}\\!\\gamma_{\\pm}}{\\sqrt{I}}$.\nFor the $1{:}1$ electrolyte:\n$$\nS_{\\pm}^{(1{:}1)} = -\\frac{\\log_{10}(0.8913)}{\\sqrt{0.0100}} = -\\frac{-0.0499743}{0.100} = 0.499743\n$$\nFor the $2{:}1$ electrolyte:\n$$\nS_{\\pm}^{(2{:}1)} = -\\frac{\\log_{10}(0.7943)}{\\sqrt{0.009999}} = -\\frac{-0.100002}{0.099995} = 1.00007\n$$\nFinally, we compute the diagnostic ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{S_{\\pm}^{(2{:}1)}}{S_{\\pm}^{(1{:}1)}} = \\frac{1.00007}{0.499743} = 2.0011...\n$$\nThis experimental ratio is very close to the theoretical prediction based on our derived formula $S_{\\pm} = A|z_+z_-|$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{theory}} = \\frac{|z_+ z_-|^{(2{:}1)}}{|z_+ z_-|^{(1{:}1)}} = \\frac{|(+2)(-1)|}{|(+1)(-1)|} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n$$\nThe experimental data are in excellent agreement with the theory. The problem asks for the numerical value of $R$ from the measured values, rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $R = 2.0011...$.

The problem is scientifically valid, self-contained, and well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation first, followed by the numerical calculation.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which describes the electrostatic potential $\\psi$ in an electrolyte solution. It combines the Poisson equation from electrostatics with the Boltzmann distribution for the spatial arrangement of ions.\n\nThe Poisson equation relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ to the local charge density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ in a dielectric medium with permittivity $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}{\\varepsilon} $$\nThe permittivity of the medium is given by $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r$, where $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity and $\\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the solvent. The charge density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is the sum of charges of all ionic species $i$ present in the solution at a position $\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i n_i(\\mathbf{r}) z_i e $$\nHere, $n_i(\\mathbf{r})$ is the local number density of ion species $i$, $z_i$ is its charge number (valence), and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nUnder conditions of thermal equilibrium, the local number density $n_i(\\mathbf{r})$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution, which relates it to the bulk number density $n_{i,0}$ and the local electrostatic potential energy $z_i e \\psi(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$ n_i(\\mathbf{r}) = n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\psi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann distribution into the expression for charge density gives:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = e \\sum_i z_i n_{i,0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\psi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nFor dilute solutions, the Debye-Hückel approximation assumes that the electrostatic energy of an ion is much smaller than its thermal energy, i.e., $|z_i e \\psi(\\mathbf{r})| \\ll k_B T$.

For an overall electrically neutral solution, this term is zero: $\\sum_i z_i n_{i,0} = 0$.

We define the term in parentheses as the square of the inverse Debye screening length, or the screening parameter, $\\kappa^2$:\n$$ \\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T} \\sum_i n_{i,0} z_i^2 $$\nThe equation is then written more compactly as:\n$$ \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\kappa^2 \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nTo perform calculations using molar concentrations, we relate the bulk number density $n_{i,0}$ (in ions per $\\mathrm{m^3}$) to the molar concentration $c_i$ (in $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$) using Avogadro's number $N_A$: $n_{i,0} = c_i N_A$.
