This problem challenges you to act as a detective, deducing the origins of spectral broadening by comparing a molecule's signature in two vastly different environments: a dynamic room-temperature solution and a static, cryogenic inert-gas matrix [@problem_id:1447685]. Mastering this type of analysis is key to understanding how molecular dynamics and intermolecular interactions, central to the distinction between homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening, are encoded in a spectral line shape.", "problem": "An analytical chemist investigates the vibrational properties of 1,2-dichloroethane ($\\text{ClCH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Cl}$), a molecule known to exist as a mixture of conformational isomers (*anti* and *gauche*) due to rotation about its central carbon-carbon bond. Two experiments are performed to record its Infrared (IR) absorption spectrum.\n\nExperiment 1: The spectrum is recorded for 1,2-dichloroethane dissolved in carbon tetrachloride ($\\text{CCl}_4$) at room temperature (298 K). The resulting spectrum shows a relatively small number of absorption bands, and these bands are notably broad. For example, the C-Cl stretching region shows a single, broad absorption centered around 730 cm$^{-1}$.\n\nExperiment 2: The spectrum is recorded using matrix isolation spectroscopy. A gaseous mixture of 1,2-dichloroethane heavily diluted in argon is deposited onto a cesium iodide window cooled to 10 K. The resulting solid is a rigid, inert argon matrix in which individual 1,2-dichloroethane molecules are trapped. The spectrum recorded under these conditions exhibits a significantly larger number of sharp, narrow absorption bands compared to the room-temperature solution spectrum. For instance, the C-Cl stretching region now clearly resolves separate, sharp peaks for the *anti* conformer (at 741 cm$^{-1}$) and the *gauche* conformer (at 707 cm$^{-1}$), among many other newly resolved features across the spectrum.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most complete and accurate physical rationale for the observed differences in the number of bands and their linewidths between the two experiments?\n\nA. At 10 K, Doppler broadening is eliminated, causing all spectral lines to become sharp. The increased number of bands is due to the formation of a molecular crystal of 1,2-dichloroethane, which introduces new lattice vibrational modes (phonons) that are IR active.\n\nB. In the room-temperature solution, a significant population of molecules exists in excited vibrational states. Transitions from these excited states (\"hot bands\") overlap with the fundamental transitions, causing the bands to appear broad and fewer in number. At 10 K, these excited states are depopulated, resulting in sharp, fundamental-only transitions.\n\nC. At room temperature, the molecules rotate freely and interact strongly with the surrounding solvent molecules, leading to significant lifetime and inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral lines. In the 10 K matrix, molecular rotation is quenched and dynamic solvent interactions are absent. This isolates the molecules, allowing for the observation of sharp bands corresponding to each distinct, non-interconverting conformer (*gauche* and *anti*) that were frozen out from the gas phase.\n\nD. The dielectric constant of the solid argon matrix is much lower than that of the liquid $\\text{CCl}_4$ solvent. This change in the surrounding medium causes a large shift in the vibrational frequencies, and according to selection rules, forbidden transitions become allowed in the low-dielectric argon environment, leading to more bands. The broadness in solution is due to rapid interconversion between conformers, which averages their signals.\n\nE. At 10 K, quantum mechanical tunneling between the *anti* and *gauche* potential wells is frozen out, locking each molecule into a single conformation. In the room-temperature solution, rapid tunneling averages the vibrational frequencies of the two conformers, leading to fewer, broader bands. The line sharpening is due to the increased detector sensitivity at cryogenic temperatures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the most accurate explanation for two key observations when comparing the Infrared (IR) spectrum of 1,2-dichloroethane in a room-temperature solution versus in a cryogenic, inert-gas matrix: (1) an increase in the number of observed bands and (2) a dramatic sharpening of these bands.\n\nLet's analyze the physical phenomena at play in each environment.\n\n1.  **Room-Temperature Solution (298 K in $\\text{CCl}_4$)**\n    *   **Conformational Dynamics**: 1,2-dichloroethane has a relatively low energy barrier for rotation around the C-C bond (a few kcal/mol or kJ/mol). At room temperature (298 K), the available thermal energy ($k_B T$) is sufficient for molecules to rapidly interconvert between the *anti* and *gauche* conformations. If this interconversion is fast on the timescale of the IR measurement, the spectrum can represent a population-weighted average of the conformers, potentially leading to the merging of distinct bands into a single, broader feature.\n    *   **Linewidth Broadening Mechanisms**:\n        *   **Inhomogeneous Broadening**: In a liquid solution, each solute molecule experiences a slightly different local environment due to the constantly changing positions and orientations of the surrounding solvent molecules. This distribution of local environments leads to a distribution of vibrational frequencies for the same mode in different molecules, causing the observed spectral band to be a superposition of many slightly shifted sharp lines, resulting in a broad envelope.\n        *   **Homogeneous Broadening**: Molecules in solution are free to rotate. While discrete rotational-vibrational lines are not resolved for a molecule of this size in the liquid phase, the unresolved rotational envelope contributes to the overall width of the vibrational band. Furthermore, collisions with solvent molecules can shorten the lifetime of the excited vibrational state, which, by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$), leads to a broadening of the energy level and thus the spectral line (lifetime broadening).\n\n2.  **Cryogenic Matrix Isolation (10 K in Solid Argon)**\n    *   **Conformational Dynamics**: At 10 K, the thermal energy ($k_B T$) is far too low to overcome the rotational barrier between the *anti* and *gauche* conformers. When the gas-phase mixture is rapidly cooled and deposited, the conformers present in the gas phase (at a higher temperature) are trapped or \"frozen out\" in the rigid argon matrix in their respective potential wells. They cannot interconvert. Therefore, the matrix contains a static population of both *anti* and *gauche* species. Since these two conformers have different symmetries and geometries, they have distinct sets of vibrational frequencies. The overall spectrum is a simple superposition of the individual spectra of the *anti* conformer and the *gauche* conformer. This directly explains the **increase in the number of observed bands**. For example, the single broad C-Cl stretch in solution resolves into two sharp, distinct peaks for the *anti* and *gauche* forms.\n    *   **Linewidth Narrowing**:\n        *   **Quenching of Rotation**: The trapped molecules are held in fixed positions and orientations within the argon \"cages.\" They cannot rotate freely. This completely eliminates the contribution of rotational envelopes to the linewidth.\n        *   **Uniform Environment**: Each trapped molecule is surrounded by a highly uniform and static cage of inert argon atoms. This eliminates the dynamic solvent-solute interactions that cause inhomogeneous broadening in the liquid phase. Intermolecular interactions are weak and nearly identical for every trapped molecule.\n        *   **Increased Lifetime**: At 10 K, collisional de-excitation is virtually nonexistent, increasing the lifetime of the excited vibrational state and correspondingly reducing lifetime broadening.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A**: This option incorrectly identifies Doppler broadening as the primary cause of sharpening. Doppler broadening is most significant in the gas phase and is negligible compared to the intermolecular interaction effects in a condensed phase. Furthermore, it incorrectly attributes the new bands to a molecular crystal lattice. Matrix isolation is specifically designed to *prevent* solute-solute aggregation and crystallization by trapping individual molecules in an inert host.\n\n*   **B**: This option focuses on \"hot bands\". While it is true that excited vibrational states are less populated at 10 K, and hot bands are less intense, this is not the primary reason for the dramatic sharpening of the fundamental bands, nor does it explain why the *number* of fundamental bands increases (i.e., why one band splits into two or more).\n\n*   **C**: This option correctly identifies all the key points. It explains the line broadening in solution by referencing molecular rotation and dynamic solvent interactions (inhomogeneous broadening). It correctly explains that in the 10 K matrix, these broadening mechanisms are removed (rotation is quenched, environment is static). Crucially, it also correctly explains the increase in the number of bands by stating that the distinct *anti* and *gauche* conformers are \"frozen out\" and observed as separate, non-interconverting species, each with its own spectrum. This is the most complete and accurate explanation.\n\n*   **D**: This option invokes a change in dielectric constant, which does affect vibrational frequencies, but it incorrectly suggests that selection rules change to allow forbidden transitions. While the local symmetry in the matrix might be lower, this is not the main reason for the appearance of so many new, strong bands. The primary reason is the resolution of different conformers. The explanation for broadening (\"rapid interconversion... averages their signals\") is plausible but less complete than the explanation in C, which also includes rotational and solvent effects.\n\n*   **E**: This option incorrectly focuses on quantum mechanical tunneling as the primary mechanism for interconversion. While tunneling can occur, the dominant process enabling interconversion at room temperature is classical thermal activation over the energy barrier. Attributing sharpening to detector sensitivity is also incorrect; the change is a property of the sample itself, not the instrument's electronics. The fundamental physics of the molecule-environment interaction is what changes.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the most comprehensive and physically sound rationale for all the observed spectral changes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1447685"}, {"introduction": "An observed spectral line is rarely ideal; it is the convolution of the intrinsic physical line shape with contributions from the measuring apparatus and data processing.

The spectrometer also contributes a static, frequency-domain Gaussian instrumental response with standard deviation $\\sigma_{I}$ (e.g., due to finite slit width and aberrations).

The relevant principle is the convolution theorem, which states that multiplication in one domain (e.g., time) is equivalent to convolution in the conjugate domain (e.g., frequency). The convolution of two functions $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ is denoted by $(g * h)(x)$.\n\nThe problem specifies three distinct contributions to the final line shape, all of which are modeled as Gaussian functions.\n$1$. The intrinsic line shape due to Doppler broadening, $L_{D}(f)$, is a Gaussian in the frequency domain with a given standard deviation $\\sigma_{D}$. Its variance is $\\sigma_{D}^2$.\n$2$. The static instrumental response, $L_{I}(f)$, is also a frequency-domain Gaussian function with a given standard deviation $\\sigma_{I}$. Its variance is $\\sigma_{I}^2$.\n$3$. The apodization function, $W(t)$, is applied as a multiplicative window in the time domain. According to the convolution theorem, its effect in the frequency domain is a convolution with the Fourier transform of the window, $L_{A}(f) = \\mathcal{F}[W(t)]$.\n\nThe observed line shape is thus the convolution of these three functions:\n$$L_{obs}(f) = L_{D}(f) * L_{I}(f) * L_{A}(f)$$\n\nA fundamental property of Gaussian functions is that the convolution of two or more Gaussians is another Gaussian. The variance of the resultant Gaussian is the sum of the variances of the individual Gaussians being convolved. Let $\\sigma_{obs}$ be the standard deviation of the observed line shape. Its variance, $\\sigma_{obs}^2$, is given by the sum of the variances from each contribution:\n$$\\sigma_{obs}^2 = \\sigma_{D}^2 + \\sigma_{I}^2 + \\sigma_{A}^2$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{A}$ is the standard deviation of the apodization line shape function $L_{A}(f)$.\n\nWe must determine $\\sigma_{A}$ from its time-domain definition.

The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian. For a time-domain Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma_t$, its Fourier transform (using the convention $S(f) = \\int s(t) \\exp(2 \\pi i f t) \\, dt$) is a frequency-domain Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma_f$ given by the uncertainty relation:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma_t}$$\nApplying this to the apodization window, we find the standard deviation of its frequency-domain representation $L_A(f)$ to be:\n$$\\sigma_{A} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_a}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the total variance gives:\n$$\\sigma_{obs}^2 = \\sigma_{D}^2 + \\sigma_{I}^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_a}\\right)^2$$\nThe standard deviation of the observed line shape is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_{obs} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{D}^2 + \\sigma_{I}^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_a}\\right)^2}$$\nThe problem asks for the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the observed line shape.

First, we compute $\\chi'_{\\text{num}}(\\omega) = -\\mathcal{H}[\\chi''(\\omega)]$. Then, we verify if the computed pair $(\\chi'_{\\text{num}}, \\chi'')$ satisfies both KK relations. This is quantified by the residuals $E_1$ and $E_2$.\n$E_1$ checks if $\\chi'' \\approx \\mathcal{H}[\\chi']$, and $E_2$ checks if $\\chi' \\approx -\\mathcal{H}[\\chi'']$. The use of mean-subtracted functions (e.g., $\\chi''(\\omega) - \\langle \\chi'' \\rangle$) is crucial because the discrete Hilbert transform of a non-zero constant (DC component) is zero, unlike the continuous case. This correction ensures we are testing the relations for the AC components of the signals, which is the correct procedure for functions on a finite periodic domain that do not decay to zero at the boundaries. The average of the two residuals, $\\mathrm{RMS}_{\\text{self}}$, provides a robust measure of the numerical transform's self-consistency.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import dawsn, wofz\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of numerically validating Kramers-Kronig relations\n    for different line shapes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Common Parameters ---\n    N = 2**14  # Number of grid points\n    Omega = 50.0  # Symmetric frequency grid range [-Omega, Omega]\n    alpha = 0.6  # Windowing factor\n\n    # --- Grid and Window Setup ---\n    # Use endpoint=False for FFT-friendly grid spacing.\n    # The grid spans from -Omega to Omega - d_omega.\n    omega = np.linspace(-Omega, Omega, N, endpoint=False)\n    d_omega = 2 * Omega / N\n    \n    omega_win = alpha * Omega\n    window_mask = np.abs(omega) <= omega_win\n    M = np.sum(window_mask)\n\n    def hilbert_transform(f):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the Hilbert transform using the FFT method, adhering to the\n        convention specified in the problem statement:\n        H[f](w) = (1/pi) * PV-Integral[ f(w') / (w - w') dw' ]\n        The Fourier transform of this operation is multiplication by i*sgn(nu).\n        \"\"\"\n        f_w = np.fft.fft(f)\n        \n        # Create the i*sgn(nu) multiplier for the discrete frequencies\n        h = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.complex128)\n        \n        # Positive frequencies\n        h[1 : N // 2] = 1j\n        # Negative frequencies\n        h[N // 2 + 1 :] = -1j\n        \n        # The Nyquist frequency (at N/2) is real and has no sgn partner, set to 0.\n        # DC component (at 0) is also set to 0.\n        \n        # Transform back to the original domain\n        f_h = np.fft.ifft(f_w * h)\n        \n        # The result should be real; taking .real removes negligible numerical noise\n        return f_h.real\n\n    results = []\n\n    # --- Test A: Homogeneous Lorentzian ---\n    gamma_L = 0.5\n    \n    # Imaginary part (absorption)\n    chi_pp_L = gamma_L / (omega**2 + gamma_L**2)\n    \n    # Numerically computed real part\n    chi_p_num_L = -hilbert_transform(chi_pp_L)\n    \n    # Analytic real part (KK partner)\n    chi_p_an_L = -omega / (omega**2 + gamma_L**2)\n    \n    # RMS deviation in the central window\n    rms_kk_A = np.sqrt(np.sum((chi_p_num_L[window_mask] - chi_p_an_L[window_mask])**2) / M)\n    results.append(rms_kk_A)\n\n    # --- Test B: Inhomogeneous Gaussian ---\n    sigma_G = 1.2\n    \n    # Imaginary part (absorption)\n    chi_pp_G = np.exp(-(omega / sigma_G)**2)\n    \n    # Numerically computed real part\n    chi_p_num_G = -hilbert_transform(chi_pp_G)\n    \n    # Analytic real part (KK partner)\n    # chi'_analytic = 2/sqrt(pi) * dawsn(omega/sigma)\n    chi_p_an_G = (2 / np.sqrt(np.pi)) * dawsn(omega / sigma_G)\n    \n    # RMS deviation in the central window\n    rms_kk_B = np.sqrt(np.sum((chi_p_num_G[window_mask] - chi_p_an_G[window_mask])**2) / M)\n    results.append(rms_kk_B)\n\n    # --- Test C: Voigt Profile ---\n    sigma_V = 0.8\n    gamma_V = 0.3\n    \n    # Argument for the Faddeeva function\n    z_V = (omega + 1j * gamma_V) / (sigma_V * np.sqrt(2))\n    \n    # Imaginary part (absorption) is proportional to Re[w(z)]\n    # Use wofz from scipy.special which computes w(z)\n    chi_pp_V = np.real(wofz(z_V))\n    \n    # Compute the numerical KK partner\n    chi_p_num_V = -hilbert_transform(chi_pp_V)\n\n    # For self-consistency check, apply DC offset correction\n    chi_pp_V_corr = chi_pp_V - np.mean(chi_pp_V)\n    chi_p_num_V_corr = chi_p_num_V - np.mean(chi_p_num_V)\n\n    # Check relation: chi_pp ~ H[chi_p]\n    h_chi_p_num = hilbert_transform(chi_p_num_V)\n    res1 = h_chi_p_num - chi_pp_V_corr\n    E1 = np.sqrt(np.sum(res1[window_mask]**2) / M)\n    \n    # Check relation: chi_p ~ -H[chi_pp]\n    # We already have chi_p_num = -H[chi_pp], so H[chi_pp] = -chi_p_num\n    h_chi_pp = -chi_p_num_V\n    res2 = h_chi_pp + chi_p_num_V_corr\n    E2 = np.sqrt(np.sum(res2[window_mask]**2) / M)\n    \n    rms_self_C = (E1 + E2) / 2\n    results.append(rms_self_C)\n\n    # --- Final Output ---\n    # Format results to six decimal places as requested.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2647666"}]}
