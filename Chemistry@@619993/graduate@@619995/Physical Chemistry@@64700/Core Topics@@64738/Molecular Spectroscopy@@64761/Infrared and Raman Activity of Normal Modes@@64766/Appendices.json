Work within the classical Placzek polarizability approximation for spontaneous Raman scattering of an isotropic ensemble, and consider right-angle (90-degree) scattering with linearly polarized incident light. Take the laboratory axes so that the incident beam propagates along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$, its polarization is along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, and the scattered light is collected along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$. Define the parallel detection geometry, denoted as “vertical-vertical” (VV), as the analyzer aligned along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, and the perpendicular detection geometry, denoted as “vertical-horizontal” (VH), as the analyzer aligned along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$.\n\nFor the totally symmetric mode in $C_{2v}$, the Raman tensor in its principal molecular axes is diagonal with unequal diagonal elements, so that\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)}=\\begin{pmatrix}\nR_{xx}  0  0\\\\\n0  R_{yy}  0\\\\\n0  0  R_{zz}\n\\end{pmatrix},\\quad R_{xx}\\neq R_{yy}\\neq R_{zz}.\n$$\nLet the isotropic Placzek invariant be $a_{k}=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(R_{xx}+R_{yy}+R_{zz}\\right)$ and the anisotropy invariant be\n$$\n\\gamma_{k}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(R_{xx}-R_{yy})^{2}+(R_{yy}-R_{zz})^{2}+(R_{zz}-R_{xx})^{2}\\right],\n$$\nwhich for a diagonal tensor coincides with the usual invariant since all off-diagonal elements vanish.\n\nStarting from the definition of the induced dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{p}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\boldsymbol{E}$ and the Raman scattering amplitude proportional to $A=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{s}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{i}$, and performing the appropriate orientational average over all molecular orientations of the isotropic liquid, derive expressions for the parallel and perpendicular orientationally averaged intensities, $I_{\\parallel}$ and $I_{\\perp}$, and hence compute the depolarization ratio $\\rho=I_{\\perp}/I_{\\parallel}$ for this totally symmetric mode. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the dimensionless ratio $\\gamma_{k}/a_{k}$. No numerical evaluation is required. State your final expression for $\\rho$ and briefly interpret its limiting behavior as $\\gamma_{k}/a_{k}\\to 0$ and $\\gamma_{k}/a_{k}\\to\\infty$. The final answer should be dimensionless and expressed only as a function of $\\gamma_{k}/a_{k}$.", "solution": "The central task is to compute the orientationally averaged scattered Raman intensity for two distinct polarization geometries. The intensity of scattered light, $I$, is proportional to the squared magnitude of the induced dipole moment projected onto the analyzer polarization direction. The induced dipole moment $\\boldsymbol{p}$ oscillating at the Stokes frequency $\\omega_S = \\omega_0 - \\omega_k$ is given by $\\boldsymbol{p}(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(k)}(t) \\boldsymbol{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega_0 t)$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(k)}(t)$ is the polarizability tensor modulated by the normal mode $k$, and $\\boldsymbol{E}_0$ is the amplitude of the incident electric field polarized along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_i$. Within the Placzek approximation, the Raman scattering amplitude for a transition is proportional to the matrix element of the polarizability tensor, which we call the Raman tensor $\\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)}$. In the laboratory frame, this amplitude is $A = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{s}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{\\text{lab}}^{(k)} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{i}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{\\text{lab}}^{(k)}$ is the Raman tensor in the laboratory coordinate system and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{s}$ is the polarization vector of the scattered light.\n\nThe Raman tensor in the molecule-fixed frame, $\\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)}$, is related to the laboratory-frame tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{\\text{lab}}^{(k)}$ by the transformation $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{\\text{lab}}^{(k)} = \\boldsymbol{C} \\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)} \\boldsymbol{C}^{\\mathsf{T}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is the direction cosine matrix specifying the orientation of the molecule. For an isotropic liquid, the observed intensity is proportional to the average of $|A|^2$ over all possible molecular orientations.\n\nThe orientational averaging of the fourth-rank tensor that arises in $\\langle |A|^2 \\rangle$ is a standard, albeit tedious, procedure. The result depends on the tensor invariants of $\\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)}$. For non-resonant Raman scattering, the tensor $\\boldsymbol{R}^{(k)}$ is symmetric. The scattered intensity for an isotropic ensemble of molecules with a symmetric Raman tensor, measured at a $90$-degree angle to the incident beam, is given by two well-established expressions for the parallel ($I_{\\parallel}$) and perpendicular ($I_{\\perp}$) polarized components relative to the incident linear polarization:\n$$ I_{\\parallel} \\propto 45 a_{k}^{2} + 4 \\gamma_{k}^{2} $$\n$$ I_{\\perp} \\propto 3 \\gamma_{k}^{2} $$\nHere, $a_k$ is the isotropic invariant (mean polarizability) and $\\gamma_k^2$ is the anisotropy invariant, defined in the problem as:\n$$ a_{k} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(R_{xx} + R_{yy} + R_{zz}\\right) $$\n$$ \\gamma_{k}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (R_{xx}-R_{yy})^{2} + (R_{yy}-R_{zz})^{2} + (R_{zz}-R_{xx})^{2} \\right] $$\nThese expressions for intensity are valid for the specific geometry described: incident polarization along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ (vertical), scattering observed along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$, with the parallel analyzer along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ (VV) and perpendicular analyzer along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$ (VH). The constant of proportionality, which includes factors like the incident intensity and the fourth power of the scattered frequency, is identical for both $I_{\\parallel}$ and $I_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe depolarization ratio, $\\rho$, is defined as the ratio of the perpendicular scattered intensity to the parallel scattered intensity.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{I_{\\perp}}{I_{\\parallel}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the intensities, we obtain:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{3 \\gamma_{k}^{2}}{45 a_{k}^{2} + 4 \\gamma_{k}^{2}} $$\nThe problem requires this expression to be written in terms of the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k}$. To achieve this, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by $a_{k}^{2}$, assuming $a_k \\neq 0$. For a totally symmetric mode, $a_k$ is generally non-zero.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\frac{3 \\gamma_{k}^{2}}{a_{k}^{2}}}{\\frac{45 a_{k}^{2}}{a_{k}^{2}} + \\frac{4 \\gamma_{k}^{2}}{a_{k}^{2}}} = \\frac{3 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k}\\right)^{2}}{45 + 4 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k}\\right)^{2}} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the depolarization ratio.\n\nWe must now interpret its limiting behavior.\n\nFirst, consider the limit where the anisotropy is small compared to the isotropic part, i.e., $\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k} \\to 0$. This corresponds to a Raman tensor that is nearly spherical, where $R_{xx} \\approx R_{yy} \\approx R_{zz}$.\n$$ \\lim_{\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k} \\to 0} \\rho = \\frac{3 \\cdot 0}{45 + 4 \\cdot 0} = 0 $$\nIn this limit, the scattered light is almost exclusively polarized parallel to the incident polarization. Raman bands with $\\rho \\ll \\frac{3}{4}$ are termed \"polarized\" and are characteristic of totally symmetric vibrations. For a perfectly isotropic tensor ($\\gamma_k = 0$), such as the $A_1$ mode of a tetrahedral molecule, $\\rho=0$ exactly.\n\nSecond, consider the limit where the anisotropy is very large compared to the isotropic part, i.e., $\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k} \\to \\infty$. This scenario, while less common for totally symmetric modes (where $a_k$ is typically large), is mathematically accessible and is the defining characteristic of non-totally symmetric modes, for which $a_k=0$ by symmetry. To evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and denominator by $\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k}\\right)^{2}$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{3}{45 \\left(\\frac{a_k}{\\gamma_k}\\right)^{2} + 4} $$\nTaking the limit:\n$$ \\lim_{\\frac{\\gamma_k}{a_k} \\to \\infty} \\rho = \\frac{3}{45 \\cdot 0 + 4} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThis value, $\\rho = \\frac{3}{4}$, is the theoretical maximum for the depolarization ratio of a symmetric Raman tensor. Raman bands with $\\rho = \\frac{3}{4}$ are termed \"depolarized\" and are characteristic of non-totally symmetric vibrations. For any totally symmetric mode, such as the one in this problem, we must have $0 \\le \\rho  \\frac{3}{4}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{3 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{k}}{a_{k}}\\right)^{2}}{45 + 4 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{k}}{a_{k}}\\right)^{2}}} $$", "id": "2645728"}]}
