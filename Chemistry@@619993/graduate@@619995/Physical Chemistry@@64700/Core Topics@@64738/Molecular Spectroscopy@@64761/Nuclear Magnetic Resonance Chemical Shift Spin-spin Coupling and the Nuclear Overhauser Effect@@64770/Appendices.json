The angle $\\phi = 60^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a synclinal (or gauche) conformation. The calculated coupling constant is largest for the anti conformation ($J(180^{\\circ}) = 9.00\\,\\text{Hz}$), while the gauche conformation exhibits a smaller coupling ($J(60^{\\circ}) = 6.00\\,\\text{Hz}$). This observation is physically correct and fundamental to conformational analysis using NMR. The efficiency of the through-bond Fermi contact interaction pathway is maximized for planar arrangements of the coupled nuclei and the intervening bonds, which occurs at $\\phi = 0^{\\circ}$ (syn-periplanar) and $\\phi = 180^{\\circ}$ (anti-periplanar), leading to larger coupling constants. The gauche conformation represents a less efficient overlap pathway, resulting in a smaller value for $J$. The value at $\\phi = 120^{\\circ}$ ($7.00\\,\\text{Hz}$) also reflects a non-maximal coupling interaction compared to the anti conformation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6.00 & 7.00 & 9.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2656439"}]}
