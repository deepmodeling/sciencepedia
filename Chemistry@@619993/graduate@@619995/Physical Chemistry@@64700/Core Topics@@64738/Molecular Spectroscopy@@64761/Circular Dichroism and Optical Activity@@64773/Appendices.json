This dependence arises primarily from the temperature-induced shift in the conformational equilibrium of the chiral molecule. Different conformers of a flexible molecule typically have different optical rotations. The observed specific rotation is a Boltzmann-weighted average over all populated conformers. A change in temperature from $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ will alter the Boltzmann distribution, changing the relative populations of the conformers and thus changing the value of $[\\alpha]$. A secondary, smaller effect is the temperature dependence of the solvent's refractive index. Therefore, using the value of $[\\alpha]$ at $20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to predict the rotation at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ introduces a systematic error, as the true value of $[\\alpha]$ at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ would be different.\n\n(ii) Effect of finite spectral bandwidth: The specific rotation is also a function of wavelength, a phenomenon known as optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). The calculation assumes the use of perfectly monochromatic light at precisely $\\lambda = 546\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Any real light source, however, possesses a finite spectral bandwidth, meaning it emits a distribution of wavelengths centered around $546\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The observed rotation is the integrated effect over this wavelength distribution, weighted by the spectral intensity. Since $[\\alpha]$ is a function of $\\lambda$, the measured rotation will be an average value, $\\langle\\alpha(\\lambda)\\rangle$, over the bandwidth. If the ORD curve, $[\\alpha]$ versus $\\lambda$, is non-linear across the spectral bandwidth, this average value will differ from the value at the central wavelength, $\\alpha(546\\,\\mathrm{nm})$. This deviation is particularly pronounced near an electronic transition, where $[\\alpha]$ changes rapidly with $\\lambda$ (the Cotton effect). Using a value for a single wavelength to predict the result from a source with a finite bandwidth neglects this effect and reduces the accuracy of the prediction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.05}\n$$", "id": "2628896"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, we now explore the powerful connection between circular dichroism and chemical thermodynamics.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires deriving an explicit expression for the temperature-dependent ellipticity, $\\theta(T)$. The observed ellipticity is stated to be proportional to the population-weighted average rotatory strength, $\\overline{R}(T)$. We can write this relationship as $\\theta(T) = C \\cdot \\overline{R}(T)$, where $C$ is a proportionality constant.\n\nThe average rotatory strength is given by:\n$$\n\\overline{R}(T) = x_A(T) R_{0n}^{(A)} + x_B(T) R_{0n}^{(B)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $R_{0n}^{(A)} = +R_0$ and $R_{0n}^{(B)} = -R_0$:\n$$\n\\overline{R}(T) = x_A(T) (+R_0) + x_B(T) (-R_0) = R_0 (x_A(T) - x_B(T))\n$$\nThe proportionality constant $C$ can be determined from the calibration measurement for pure conformer $A$. For pure $A$, $x_A=1$ and $x_B=0$, so $\\overline{R} = R_0$. The corresponding ellipticity is given as $\\theta_A^0$. Thus, $\\theta_A^0 = C \\cdot R_0$, which implies $C = \\theta_A^0 / R_0$.\n\nNow we can write the expression for $\\theta(T)$:\n$$\n\\theta(T) = C \\cdot \\overline{R}(T) = \\frac{\\theta_A^0}{R_0} \\cdot R_0 (x_A(T) - x_B(T)) = \\theta_A^0 (x_A(T) - x_B(T))\n$$\nThe mole fractions $x_A(T)$ and $x_B(T)$ are related by the equilibrium constant $K(T) = x_B(T) / x_A(T)$ and the conservation condition $x_A(T) + x_B(T) = 1$. From these two relations, we can express the mole fractions in terms of $K(T)$:\n$$\nx_A(T) = \\frac{1}{1 + K(T)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_B(T) = \\frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\theta(T)$:\n$$\n\\theta(T) = \\theta_A^0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K(T)} - \\frac{K(T)}{1 + K(T)} \\right) = \\theta_A^0 \\frac{1 - K(T)}{1 + K(T)}\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant is governed by the Gibbs free energy difference, $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$, through the relation $K(T) = \\exp(-\\Delta G / (RT))$. Substituting this gives the final explicit expression for $\\theta(T)$:\n$$\n\\theta(T) = \\theta_A^0 \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H - T\\Delta S}{RT}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H - T\\Delta S}{RT}\\right)} = \\theta_A^0 \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S}{R}\\right)}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part is to calculate $\\Delta H$.

A valid protocol must specify a density functional, a basis set, a treatment for the gauge-origin dependence of rotatory strengths, and a procedure to assess convergence with respect to diffuse basis functions.\n\nBefore evaluating the options, we establish the requirements for each component based on first principles of quantum chemistry and spectroscopy.\n\n1.  **Density Functional**: The simultaneous presence of valence and Rydberg excitations is a demanding test for any electronic structure method. Standard global hybrid functionals, such as `B3LYP` and `PBE0`, and pure functionals (not listed, but for completeness) suffer from an incorrect description of the long-range exchange-correlation potential, which does not have the correct Coulombic $(-1/r)$ asymptotic behavior. This deficiency leads to a severe underestimation of the excitation energies of Rydberg states, often causing them to collapse into the valence manifold. To correctly model Rydberg states, a functional that incorporates a correct long-range potential is mandatory. Long-range corrected (LRC) hybrid functionals, such as `CAM-B3LYP` and the `ωB97` family (e.g., `ωB97X-D`), are specifically designed to address this issue and are essential for this problem.\n\n2.  **Basis Set**: Rydberg states are characterized by an electron occupying a very spatially diffuse orbital. To represent such orbitals, the one-electron basis set must contain functions with very small exponents, known as diffuse functions. Basis sets lacking diffuse functions, such as standard Pople-style sets (e.g., `6-31G(d)`) or non-augmented correlation-consistent sets (e.g., `cc-pVTZ`), are fundamentally incapable of describing Rydberg states. The minimal requirement is a basis set augmented with at least one set of diffuse functions on all atoms, such as the Dunning `aug-` series (e.g., `aug-cc-pVDZ`) or the Ahlrichs `def2-` series with diffuse functions (e.g., `def2-TZVPD`).\n\n3.  **Gauge-Origin Problem**: The rotatory strength, $R_{0k}$, for an electronic transition from the ground state $\\psi_0$ to an excited state $\\psi_k$ is given by the Rosenfeld equation:\n    $$ R_{0k} = \\text{Im} \\left( \\langle \\psi_0 | \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{el} | \\psi_k \\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\psi_k | \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{mag} | \\psi_0 \\rangle \\right) $$\n    where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{el}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{mag}$ are the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments, respectively. While $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{el}$ is origin-independent in the length-gauge formulation, the magnetic dipole operator, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{mag} = (e/2m_e) \\sum_i (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}_G) \\times \\mathbf{p}_i$, explicitly depends on the choice of gauge origin, $\\mathbf{R}_G$. For an exact wavefunction, $R_{0k}$ is origin-independent. However, for approximate wavefunctions derived from finite basis sets, $R_{0k}$ becomes spuriously origin-dependent. Simply choosing a fixed origin (e.g., the center of mass) is an inadequate and arbitrary solution. A reliable calculation must employ an origin-invariant formulation. Modern methods include using Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAOs), or explicit origin-invariant rotatory strength expressions such as the modified velocity gauge (MVG) or origin-invariant length gauge (LG(OI)). The agreement between length-gauge (LG) and velocity-gauge (VG) rotatory strengths is also a powerful diagnostic of basis set completeness; for a complete basis, $R_{0k}^{\\text{LG}} = R_{0k}^{\\text{VG}}$.\n\n4.  **Convergence Assessment**: The problem explicitly requires a procedure to assess convergence with respect to diffuse functions. This is critical because Rydberg states and chiroptical properties are exceptionally sensitive to the diffuse part of the basis. A defensible procedure must therefore involve the systematic addition of diffuse functions (e.g., comparing results from a non-augmented basis to a singly-augmented `aug-` basis, and then to a doubly-augmented `d-aug-` basis) and monitoring the impact on the calculated properties. Crucially, one must monitor not only the excitation energies but also the rotatory strengths, as the latter are often far more sensitive to basis set deficiencies. Furthermore, checking the agreement between LG and VG rotatory strengths provides an independent and robust measure of basis set quality.\n\nWith these criteria established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Use the global hybrid functional `B3LYP` with the split-valence basis `6-31G(d)`, compute ECD in the standard length gauge by placing the gauge origin at the center of mass, and assess convergence by verifying that the lowest few excitation energies change by less than $0.02$ $\\text{eV}$ when moving to `6-311G(d,p)`.**\nThis protocol is incorrect. (1) `B3LYP` is a global hybrid and is unsuitable for Rydberg states. (2) `6-31G(d)` is a minimal basis set completely lacking the diffuse functions necessary for Rydberg states. (3) Placing the gauge origin at the center of mass does not solve the gauge-origin problem; the results remain origin-dependent and unreliable. (4) The convergence check is inadequate because it compares two basis sets that both lack diffuse functions, and it only considers excitation energies, ignoring the more sensitive rotatory strengths.\n\n**B.

(1) It specifies LRC functionals suitable for Rydberg states. (2) It mandates basis sets with the necessary diffuse functions. (3) It employs a proper origin-invariant formalism for rotatory strengths. (4) It describes a rigorous and appropriate convergence assessment procedure that focuses on the addition of diffuse functions, monitors the relevant physical observables (energies and rotatory strengths), and uses the LG/VG agreement as an additional quality check. This protocol represents the current state-of-the-art for this type of calculation.\n\n**C.

(4) The convergence check is flawed; it uses another basis without diffuse functions (`cc-pVQZ`) and incorrectly monitors oscillator strengths instead of the required rotatory strengths.\n\n**D. Use the long-range corrected hybrid `ωB97X-D` with `def2-TZVPD` and gauge-including atomic orbitals, compute length-gauge rotatory strengths without explicit origin-invariant corrections because gauge-including atomic orbitals ensure origin independence, and assess convergence by tightening the numerical integration grid and self-consistent field thresholds without adding further diffuse functions.**\nThis protocol is incorrect. While the choices of functional (`ωB97X-D`), basis set (`def2-TZVPD`), and gauge treatment (GIAOs) are sound, the convergence assessment procedure is completely misdirected. It fails entirely to address the problem's explicit requirement to assess convergence with respect to diffuse functions. Tightening numerical thresholds is a check for numerical noise, not for the physical accuracy of the basis set representation, which is the dominant source of error in this context.\n\n**E. Use time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF) in the Tamm–Dancoff approximation with `aug-cc-pVDZ`, compute ECD in the velocity gauge, and assess convergence by comparing the velocity- and length-gauge excitation energies for the brightest transitions only.**\nThis protocol is incorrect. (1) It proposes using TDHF, but the problem specifies TDDFT. (2) It relies on a single gauge (VG), which is origin-dependent and provides no internal check of quality. (3) The convergence check is nonsensical: excitation energies are identical in the LG and VG formalisms, while it is the oscillator and rotatory strengths that differ. Furthermore, focusing only on the \"brightest\" transitions is a critical error for ketones, where the diagnostically important $n \\to \\pi^\\*$ transition is often weak in absorption (low oscillator strength) but strong in ECD.\n\nIn conclusion, only protocol B satisfies all scientific and technical requirements for the stated problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2628885"}]}
