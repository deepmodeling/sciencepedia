We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is described by a three-state Jablonski diagram involving the ground singlet state $\\mathrm{S}_0$, the first excited singlet state $\\mathrm{S}_1$, and the lowest triplet state $\\mathrm{T}_1$. The depopulation of the $\\mathrm{S}_1$ state occurs via three competing first-order processes: fluorescence ($k_r$), internal conversion ($k_{nr}$), and intersystem crossing ($k_{ISC}$). The total decay rate constant for the $\\mathrm{S}_1$ state, denoted $k_{S_1}$, is the sum of the rate constants of these parallel channels:\n$$k_{S_1} = k_r + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}$$\nAccording to the provided definition, the fluorescence lifetime $\\tau_F$ is the reciprocal of the total decay rate constant of the emitting state $\\mathrm{S}_1$:\n$$\\tau_F = \\frac{1}{k_{S_1}} = \\frac{1}{k_r + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}}$$\nThe fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_F$ is defined as the fraction of molecules in $\\mathrm{S}_1$ that decay through the fluorescence channel. This is the ratio of the fluorescence rate constant to the total decay rate constant:\n$$\\Phi_F = \\frac{k_r}{k_r + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}} = k_r \\tau_F$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the radiative rate constant $k_r$ in terms of the experimental observables $\\Phi_F$ and $\\tau_F$:\n$$k_r = \\frac{\\Phi_F}{\\tau_F}$$\nThe sum of the rate constants for the nonradiative decay channels from $\\mathrm{S}_1$, which are internal conversion and intersystem crossing, is given by $k_{nr} + k_{ISC}$. This sum can be found by rearranging the expression for the total decay rate:\n$$k_{nr} + k_{ISC} = k_{S_1} - k_r = \\frac{1}{\\tau_F} - \\frac{\\Phi_F}{\\tau_F} = \\frac{1 - \\Phi_F}{\\tau_F}$$\nWith the given values $\\tau_F = 4\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 4 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ and $\\Phi_F = 0.6$, we can determine the value of $k_r$ and the sum $k_{nr} + k_{ISC}$.

The problem also specifies that no independent measurements of nonradiative decay rates from $\\mathrm{T}_1$ are made, which implies such processes could exist. Let the rate constant for any first-order nonradiative decay from $\\mathrm{T}_1$ (e.g., intersystem crossing to $\\mathrm{S}_0$) be $k_{nr,T}$. The total decay rate constant for the $\\mathrm{T}_1$ state, $k_{T_1}$, is:\n$$k_{T_1} = k_P + k_{nr,T}$$\nThe phosphorescence lifetime $\\tau_P$ is the lifetime of the $\\mathrm{T}_1$ state, given by the reciprocal of its total decay rate constant:\n$$\\tau_P = \\frac{1}{k_{T_1}} = \\frac{1}{k_P + k_{nr,T}}$$\nUsing the given value $\\tau_P = 1\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$, we find the total decay rate of $\\mathrm{T}_1$:\n$$k_{T_1} = \\frac{1}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nTherefore, we have the relation $k_P + k_{nr,T} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

A single dominant totally symmetric normal mode underlies the observed vibronic progressions.\n    2. The vibrational structure can be described by displaced harmonic oscillators for $S_0$ and $S_1$.\n    3. The Condon approximation is the baseline model, and deviations are described by Herzberg–Teller vibronic coupling.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement describes a standard scenario in molecular photophysics. The concepts invoked—vibronic progressions, displaced harmonic oscillators, the Condon approximation, Herzberg-Teller coupling, and the mirror-image rule—are fundamental to the field. The provided data (transition energies and relative intensities) are physically realistic for a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The question asks for an interpretation of the data within the given theoretical frameworks, which is a well-posed scientific problem.\n\nThe notation for the fluorescence transitions, specifically $E_{1-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}}$ and $E_{2-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}}$, is non-standard. Typically, fluorescence at room temperature originates from the lowest vibrational level of the first excited singlet state ($S_1, v'=0$) due to rapid vibrational relaxation (Kasha's rule). The vibronic progression in emission therefore corresponds to transitions to various vibrational levels of the ground state ($S_0, v''=0, 1, 2, \\dots$). These transitions are commonly denoted as $0-0, 0-1, 0-2$, etc. The problem's notation ($1-0, 2-0$) could be interpreted as `final vibrational level - initial vibrational level`, i.e., $v''=1 \\leftarrow v'=0$ and $v''=2 \\leftarrow v'=0$. Given the decreasing energy of these peaks relative to the $0-0$ fluorescence peak, this interpretation is physically consistent and allows for a coherent analysis.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent under this reasonable interpretation of the notation. It is not trivial and requires a detailed analysis of spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe central task is to analyze the provided absorption and fluorescence spectra in the context of the mirror-image rule. This rule predicts that the fluorescence spectrum, plotted on an energy axis, will be a mirror image of the absorption spectrum reflected about a point of symmetry, which is near the $0-0$ origin. This symmetry strictly holds only if two conditions are met:\n1. The vibrational frequencies of the chromophore are identical in the ground ($S_0$) and excited ($S_1$) electronic states.\n2. The vibronic transition probabilities are governed by the Condon approximation, where the electronic transition dipole moment is independent of nuclear coordinates, leading to symmetric Franck-Condon factors for corresponding absorption and emission transitions.\n\nWe will analyze the provided data to check if these conditions are met.\n\n**Analysis of Vibronic Spacings**\n\nThe vibronic progression in the absorption spectrum reveals the vibrational energy level spacing ($\\tilde{\\nu}'$) in the excited state, $S_1$. The transitions are from $S_0(v''=0)$ to $S_1(v')$.\n- The energy of the first vibrational quantum in $S_1$ is the difference between the $0-1$ and $0-0$ bands:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{abs}} = E_{0-1}^{\\mathrm{abs}} - E_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{abs}} = 24{,}950\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 23{,}400\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 1{,}550\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n- The energy of the second quantum relative to the first is:\n$$ E_{0-2}^{\\mathrm{abs}} - E_{0-1}^{\\mathrm{abs}} = 26{,}500\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 24{,}950\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 1{,}550\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThe spacing is constant, consistent with the harmonic oscillator model. Thus, the vibrational frequency in the excited state is $\\tilde{\\nu}' \\approx 1{,}550\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe vibronic progression in the fluorescence spectrum reveals the vibrational energy level spacing ($\\tilde{\\nu}''$) in the ground state, $S_0$. The transitions are from $S_1(v'=0)$ to $S_0(v'')$.\n- The energy of the first vibrational quantum in $S_0$ is the difference between the $0-0$ and the next vibronic band (denoted $E_{1-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}}$ in the problem, representing the $v'=0 \\to v''=1$ transition):\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{fl}} = E_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} - E_{1-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} = 21{,}800\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 20{,}450\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 1{,}350\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n- The energy of the second quantum relative to the first is:\n$$ E_{1-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} - E_{2-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} = 20{,}450\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 19{,}100\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 1{,}350\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThe spacing is again constant, and the vibrational frequency in the ground state is $\\tilde{\\nu}'' \\approx 1{,}350\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nSince $\\tilde{\\nu}' \\approx 1{,}550\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is not equal to $\\tilde{\\nu}'' \\approx 1{,}350\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the first condition for the mirror-image rule is violated. This difference in frequency implies that the force constant associated with this vibrational mode is different in the ground and excited states.\n\n**Analysis of Intensity Distributions**\n\n- **Absorption**: The relative intensities are $I_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{abs}}=0.30$, $I_{0-1}^{\\mathrm{abs}}=1.00$, and $I_{0-2}^{\\mathrm{abs}}=0.70$. The most intense peak is the $0-1$ band. Within the Condon approximation, this indicates a significant displacement of the potential energy surface along the normal coordinate upon excitation.\n- **Fluorescence**: The relative intensities are $I_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}}=1.00$, $I_{1-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}}=0.50$, and $I_{2-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}}=0.20$. The most intense peak is the $0-0$ band.\n\nIn the simple displaced harmonic oscillator model (Condon approximation), the intensity distribution should be symmetric for absorption and emission. That is, the ratio $I_{0-1}/I_{0-0}$ should be the same for both spectra. Here we have:\n- Absorption: $I_{0-1}^{\\mathrm{abs}} / I_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{abs}} = 1.00 / 0.30 \\approx 3.33$\n- Fluorescence: $I_{1-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} / I_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} = 0.50 / 1.00 = 0.50$\n\nThis pronounced asymmetry in the intensity envelopes is a clear violation of the second condition for the mirror-image rule. It indicates that the Condon approximation is failing. The problem explicitly directs us to consider Herzberg-Teller (HT) coupling, which provides a mechanism for this failure. HT coupling involves the dependence of the electronic transition dipole moment on the nuclear coordinates, which can lead to intensity borrowing and asymmetric absorption/emission profiles, particularly when the pure electronic transition is weak or forbidden. The observation that the $0-0$ absorption is weak relative to the $0-1$ band, while the $0-0$ fluorescence is strong, is a classic signature of HT effects.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. After aligning both spectra to their respective $0-0$ origins, the mirror-image rule holds to a good approximation; the different spacings observed in absorption and fluorescence reflect solvent reorganization alone and do not imply a change in vibrational frequency between $S_0$ and $S_1$.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The calculated spacings, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{abs}} \\approx 1{,}550\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{fl}} \\approx 1{,}350\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, are demonstrably different. This difference is an intrinsic property of the molecule's vibrational modes in the $S_0$ and $S_1$ states and directly implies a change in vibrational frequency. Solvent reorganization primarily affects the absolute positions of the spectra, contributing to the Stokes shift ($E_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{abs}} - E_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} = 1{,}600\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$), but it does not account for the different rovibronic spacing within each spectrum.\n\n**B. The mirror-image rule is violated because the vibronic spacing in absorption, approximately $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{abs}} \\approx 1{,}550\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, differs from that in fluorescence, approximately $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{fl}} \\approx 1{,}350\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This indicates different vibrational frequencies in $S_1$ and $S_0$, consistent with a change in force constant and equilibrium geometry upon excitation.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. Our analysis confirms the different vibrational spacings, $\\tilde{\\nu}' \\neq \\tilde{\\nu}''$. This is a primary reason for the breakdown of the mirror-image rule. A change in vibrational frequency ($\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{k/\\mu}$) implies a change in the force constant $k$ of the bond/mode upon electronic excitation. The presence of a vibronic progression itself indicates a change in equilibrium geometry. This statement accurately describes a key finding from the data.\n\n**C. The relatively strong $0-1$ absorption band compared to the $0-0$ absorption band, contrasted with a strong $0-0$ fluorescence band, can be rationalized by Herzberg–Teller vibronic coupling enhancing vibronically induced absorption, while emission from $v^{\\prime}=0$ is closer to the Condon limit. This asymmetry in intensity patterns contributes to deviations from mirror-image symmetry.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. The data shows a profound asymmetry in the intensity envelopes of absorption and fluorescence which cannot be explained by the simple Condon-based displaced oscillator model. This pattern is a textbook example of the influence of Herzberg-Teller vibronic coupling, where intensity is borrowed from other electronic transitions, often affecting absorption and emission profiles differently. This effect is a significant contributor to the breakdown of the mirror-image relationship.\n\n**D. The weaker $0-0$ absorption than fluorescence necessarily implies fast intersystem crossing from $S_1$ to $T_1$, which distorts the absorption spectrum but not the emission spectrum; thus, violations of the mirror-image rule are a diagnostic of strong spin–orbit coupling.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. First, one cannot compare the peak heights $I_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{abs}} = 0.30$ and $I_{0-0}^{\\mathrm{fl}} = 1.00$ as absolute measures, as they are relative intensities within spectra that are individually normalized to unit area. Second, intersystem crossing (ISC) is a nonradiative decay pathway from $S_1$ that occurs *after* the absorption process. It reduces the fluorescence quantum yield but does not alter the shape or vibronic structure of the *absorption* spectrum. The argument is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**E. Exact mirror symmetry of the two spectra about the absorption $0-0$ line is expected even in the presence of a finite Stokes shift and different normal-mode frequencies; therefore any observed mismatch must be due to experimental error.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. It contains multiple errors. The axis of symmetry for the mirror-image rule is not the absorption $0-0$ line. More fundamentally, the rule is explicitly violated if the normal-mode frequencies are different, as this directly leads to different spacings in the vibronic progressions. To claim that such a clear, interpretable physical effect must be experimental error is unscientific.\n\nBoth statements B and C describe correct and significant reasons, which are well-supported by the data, for the observed failure of the mirror-image rule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$"}, {"introduction": "Modern physical chemistry increasingly relies on building predictive models to interpret complex experimental results and guide further inquiry.

You must compute, from first principles:\n- the total fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_F$ (dimensionless fraction),\n- the total phosphorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_P$ (dimensionless fraction),\n- the prompt fluorescence lifetime $\\tau_p$ (defined as the intensity-weighted lifetime of emission originating directly from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ deactivation without requiring explicit time-resolved separation; for this minimal kinetic scheme, it is governed by the net first-order depopulation rate of $\\mathrm{S_1}$), and you must express $\\tau_p$ in nanoseconds (ns).\n\nBase your derivation on the following fundamental elements only:\n- population master equations for $\\mathrm{S_1}$ and $\\mathrm{T_1}$ under first-order kinetics,\n- conservation and absorption-probability reasoning for radiative versus nonradiative deactivation channels,\n- definitions of quantum yields as probabilities of eventual radiative deactivation in the appropriate channel,\n- definition of a first-order lifetime as the inverse of the net depopulation rate of the state.\n\nDo not assume or use any shortcut formulas that directly give the target results; instead, derive the expressions used by your program from these bases.\n\nFor each test case, you are given a baseline parameter set (the “reference condition”) consisting of the six rate constants in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. You are also given an “observed condition” (condition B) consisting of three observables: total fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_F$ (dimensionless), total phosphorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_P$ (dimensionless), and prompt fluorescence lifetime $\\tau_p$ in nanoseconds (ns). Your task is to determine, via sensitivity analysis, the smallest set of rate constants that must differ from the baseline values in order for the model to reproduce the observed condition within specified tolerances. You must:\n\n1. Implement the forward model from first principles to compute $(\\Phi_F, \\Phi_P, \\tau_p)$ from a given parameter vector $\\mathbf{k} = [k_r, k_{nr}^{S}, k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}, k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}, k_p, k_{nr}^{T}]$.\n2. Implement a local sensitivity (Jacobian) analysis with respect to the logarithms of the rate constants (i.e., sensitivities with respect to $\\log k_i$), computed numerically by symmetric multiplicative perturbations, to assemble a sensitivity matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ of the observables with respect to $\\log \\mathbf{k}$.\n3. For a candidate subset of indices $S \\subset \\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$ (mapping order defined below), solve a constrained nonlinear least-squares problem using Gauss–Newton iterations on $\\log \\mathbf{k}$ to minimize the residual between the predicted observables and the observed condition, altering only the parameters in $S$ and holding all others at their baseline values. Constrain multiplicative changes of each varied parameter to lie within the factor interval $[10^{-3}, 10^{3}]$ relative to baseline values, and enforce nonnegativity of all rate constants.\n4. Search subsets $S$ by increasing cardinality, beginning with singletons, then pairs, then triplets, etc., and select the first subset size for which a feasible solution is found that matches the observed condition within the specified absolute tolerances for all three observables simultaneously. If multiple subsets of the same minimal size are feasible, select the one with the smallest sum of absolute logarithmic changes $\\sum_{i \\in S} |\\Delta \\log k_i|$; if still tied, select the one with the smallest residual norm. Sort the chosen indices in ascending order for output.\n\nIndex mapping (fixed and must be used in your program):\n- index $0$: $k_r$,\n- index $1$: $k_{nr}^{S}$,\n- index $2$: $k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}$,\n- index $3$: $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}$,\n- index $4$: $k_p$,\n- index $5$: $k_{nr}^{T}$.\n\nIn addition, your program must propose a single targeted follow-up experiment code for each test case, based on the identified varying-rate set $S$, using the following mapping:\n- If $5 \\in S$, propose oxygen-quenching control: output code $0$.\n- Else if $2 \\in S$ or $4 \\in S$, propose heavy-atom perturbation control: output code $1$.\n- Else if $3 \\in S$, propose temperature dependence of delayed fluorescence: output code $2$.\n- Else, propose time-resolved emission to separate prompt/delayed components: output code $3$.\n\nUse the following absolute tolerances for matching the observed condition: for $\\Phi_F$ use $|\\Delta \\Phi_F| \\leq 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, for $\\Phi_P$ use $|\\Delta \\Phi_P| \\leq 5 \\times 10^{-4}$, and for $\\tau_p$ use $|\\Delta \\tau_p| \\leq 1 \\times 10^{-2}$ ns.\n\nTest suite. For all four cases below, the baseline rates (reference condition) are the same vector in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n- baseline rates $\\mathbf{k}^{(0)} = [2.0 \\times 10^{7}, 1.0 \\times 10^{7}, 4.0 \\times 10^{7}, 3.0 \\times 10^{5}, 1.0 \\times 10^{3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{5}]$.\n\nFor each case, the observed condition B is given as $(\\Phi_F^{(B)}, \\Phi_P^{(B)}, \\tau_p^{(B)}\\ \\mathrm{in\\ ns})$:\n- Case $1$ (oxygen quenching scenario): $(0.286197, 5.707 \\times 10^{-6}, 14.285714)$.\n- Case $2$ (heavy-atom perturbation scenario): $(0.322581, 0.258065, 9.090909)$.\n- Case $3$ (reduced temperature suppressing reverse intersystem crossing): $(0.328733, 0.005008, 14.285714)$.\n- Case $4$ (conflicting dataset: high $\\Phi_F$ with long $\\tau_p$): $(0.830551, 3.152 \\times 10^{-4}, 40.0)$.\n\nYour program must solve all four cases in a single run and produce exactly one line of output containing a list of four results, one per case, where each result is itself a list. For each case, output a list whose first element is the recommended experiment code as defined above, followed by the sorted indices of the minimal varying-rate subset $S$. For example, a valid overall output might look like:\n- $[[0,5],[1,2,4],[2,3],[3,0,1,3]]$,\nmeaning: case $1$ recommends experiment code $0$ and varies index $5$; case $2$ recommends code $1$ and varies indices $2$ and $4$; etc.\n\nYour program must print only this single-line list, with no additional text. All physical rates are in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; lifetimes must be handled and reported internally in $\\mathrm{ns}$ to match the test-suite values. Angles are not involved. Percentages are not used; all yields are dimensionless fractions in $[0,1]$.", "solution": "We begin from the fundamental kinetic picture of a minimal Jablonski diagram with one excited singlet state $\\mathrm{S_1}$ and one triplet state $\\mathrm{T_1}$, each with first-order exit channels. Let $S(t)$ and $T(t)$ denote the populations of $\\mathrm{S_1}$ and $\\mathrm{T_1}$ at time $t$, initialized as $S(0)=1$, $T(0)=0$ by a short excitation pulse. The rate equations are\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\left(k_r + k_{nr}^{S} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}\\right) S(t) + k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}\\, T(t),\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}\\, S(t) - \\left(k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_p + k_{nr}^{T}\\right) T(t).\n$$\nDefine the singlet total depopulation rate $k_S \\equiv k_r + k_{nr}^{S} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}$ and the triplet total depopulation rate $k_T \\equiv k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_p + k_{nr}^{T}$. The singlet prompt lifetime $\\tau_p$ is defined by first-order kinetics of the $\\mathrm{S_1}$ manifold in this minimal scheme, i.e.,\n$$\n\\tau_p = \\frac{1}{k_S}.\n$$\nTo compute total emission quantum yields from first principles, we regard the kinetics as a continuous-time Markov process with absorbing outcomes corresponding to radiative and nonradiative deactivation. Let $F_S$ be the probability that, starting from $\\mathrm{S_1}$, the system ultimately emits fluorescence (a radiative $\\mathrm{S_1} \\to \\mathrm{S_0}$ event). Let $P_S$ be the probability that, starting from $\\mathrm{S_1}$, the system ultimately emits phosphorescence (a radiative $\\mathrm{T_1} \\to \\mathrm{S_0}$ event). With $r = k_r/k_S$, $s = k_{nr}^{S}/k_S$, and $i = k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}/k_S$, the one-step transition probabilities out of $\\mathrm{S_1}$ are: fluorescence with probability $r$, nonradiative singlet decay with probability $s$, and intersystem crossing to $\\mathrm{T_1}$ with probability $i$. From $\\mathrm{T_1}$, define $u = k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}/k_T$, $p = k_p/k_T$, and $t = k_{nr}^{T}/k_T$. The one-step transitions out of $\\mathrm{T_1}$ are reverse intersystem crossing with probability $u$, phosphorescence with probability $p$, and nonradiative triplet decay with probability $t$.\n\nBy first-step analysis (absorption-probability reasoning), the total probability of eventual fluorescence starting from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ satisfies\n$$\nF_S = r + i\\, F_T, \\quad F_T = u\\, F_S,\n$$\nsince fluorescence can occur immediately from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ (with probability $r$) or, if intersystem crossing occurs (probability $i$), fluorescence can still occur after returning from $\\mathrm{T_1}$ via reverse intersystem crossing (with probability $u$) and then eventually fluorescing with probability $F_S$. Solving these coupled equations yields\n$$\nF_S = \\frac{r}{1 - i\\,u}.\n$$\nSimilarly, the total probability of eventual phosphorescence starting from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ satisfies\n$$\nP_S = i\\, P_T, \\quad P_T = p + u\\, P_S,\n$$\nbecause phosphorescence only occurs from $\\mathrm{T_1}$, which is reached from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ with one-step probability $i$. Solving gives\n$$\nP_S = \\frac{i\\, p}{1 - i\\,u}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total fluorescence and phosphorescence quantum yields are $\\Phi_F = F_S$ and $\\Phi_P = P_S$, respectively. The denominator factor $(1 - i\\,u)$ accounts for the possibility of cycling between $\\mathrm{S_1}$ and $\\mathrm{T_1}$ through intersystem crossing and reverse intersystem crossing (e.g., Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) when reverse intersystem crossing is thermally activated), enhancing radiative yields.\n\nAlgorithmic design for sensitivity analysis and subset selection:\n- We denote the parameter vector as $\\mathbf{k} = [k_r, k_{nr}^{S}, k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}, k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}, k_p, k_{nr}^{T}]$ in that fixed order and the observable vector as $\\mathbf{y}(\\mathbf{k}) = [\\Phi_F(\\mathbf{k}), \\Phi_P(\\mathbf{k}), \\tau_p(\\mathbf{k})]$ with $\\tau_p$ converted to nanoseconds for comparison.\n- We operate in logarithmic parameter space to preserve positivity and express multiplicative changes naturally: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\log \\mathbf{k}$ elementwise. The Jacobian with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is $\\mathbf{J}_{\\log}$ with entries $J_{\\alpha j} = \\partial y_\\alpha / \\partial \\log k_j$, computed numerically by symmetric multiplicative perturbations. Specifically, for a small scalar $h$ we evaluate $\\mathbf{y}$ at $k_j \\to k_j (1+h)$ and $k_j \\to k_j (1-h)$ holding other components fixed, and approximate\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{y}}{\\partial \\log k_j} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{y}(\\ldots,k_j(1+h),\\ldots) - \\mathbf{y}(\\ldots,k_j(1-h),\\ldots)}{2h}.\n$$\n- For a candidate subset $S$ of parameter indices, we solve the nonlinear least-squares problem\n$$\n\\min_{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_S} \\left\\|\\mathbf{y}\\big(\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(0)} + \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\big) - \\mathbf{y}^{(B)}\\right\\|_2^2,\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(0)} = \\log \\mathbf{k}^{(0)}$ and $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is zero outside $S$. We solve iteratively by Gauss–Newton: at iteration $n$, with current parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)}$, we compute the residual $\\mathbf{r}^{(n)} = \\mathbf{y}(\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)})) - \\mathbf{y}^{(B)}$ and the Jacobian $\\mathbf{J}_{\\log}^{(n)}$ restricted to columns in $S$, and solve the linear least-squares update $\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_S^{(n)} = \\arg\\min \\|\\mathbf{J}_{\\log,S}^{(n)} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_S + \\mathbf{r}^{(n)}\\|_2^2$. We then apply a backtracking line search on the step size to ensure residual decrease, updating $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n+1)} = \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)} + \\alpha\\, \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,1]$. We enforce constraints that each varied parameter remains within multiplicative bounds $[10^{-3},10^{3}]$ relative to its baseline (i.e., $\\theta_j - \\theta_j^{(0)} \\in [\\log 10^{-3}, \\log 10^{3}]$), and all rates remain nonnegative.\n- We deem a subset $S$ feasible if, after iterations, the absolute residuals satisfy the tolerances $|\\Delta \\Phi_F| \\le 5\\times 10^{-4}$, $|\\Delta \\Phi_P| \\le 5\\times 10^{-4}$, and $|\\Delta \\tau_p| \\le 1\\times 10^{-2}$ ns. We search subsets by increasing cardinality and select the minimal size. Among ties, we choose the one minimizing $\\sum_{i \\in S} |\\Delta \\log k_i|$ (preferring smaller cumulative multiplicative deviation) and then the one with smallest residual norm.\n- Based on the selected $S$, we choose a recommended experiment code: if $5 \\in S$ (triplet nonradiative change, e.g., oxygen quenching), we output $0$; else if $2 \\in S$ or $4 \\in S$ (spin–orbit coupling changes), output $1$; else if $3 \\in S$ (reverse intersystem crossing implicated), output $2$; else output $3$ (time-resolved emission to separate components).\n\nTest suite and physical interpretation:\n- Baseline rates for all cases are $\\mathbf{k}^{(0)} = [2.0 \\times 10^{7}, 1.0 \\times 10^{7}, 4.0 \\times 10^{7}, 3.0 \\times 10^{5}, 1.0 \\times 10^{3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{5}]$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which yield moderate $\\Phi_F$ and a prompt lifetime $\\tau_p \\approx 14.285714$ ns.\n- Case $1$ observed $(\\Phi_F^{(B)}, \\Phi_P^{(B)}, \\tau_p^{(B)}) = (0.286197, 5.707\\times 10^{-6}, 14.285714)$ is consistent with a large increase in $k_{nr}^{T}$ (oxygen quenching), suppressing $\\mathrm{T_1}$ involvement and eliminating delayed components while leaving $\\tau_p$ unchanged. The minimal subset is expected to be $S=\\{5\\}$, recommending experiment code $0$.\n- Case $2$ observed $(0.322581, 0.258065, 9.090909)$ is consistent with enhanced spin–orbit coupling (heavy-atom effect), notably increasing $k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}$ and $k_p$, which shortens $\\tau_p$, reduces $\\Phi_F$, and increases $\\Phi_P$. The minimal subset is expected to be $S=\\{2,4\\}$, recommending code $1$.\n- Case $3$ observed $(0.328733, 0.005008, 14.285714)$ is consistent with reduced $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}$ at lower temperature, decreasing the cycling contribution to fluorescence while leaving $\\tau_p$ (a singlet property) unchanged and $\\Phi_P$ only mildly affected. The minimal subset is expected to be $S=\\{3\\}$, recommending code $2$.\n- Case $4$ observed $(0.830551, 3.152\\times 10^{-4}, 40.0)$ displays high $\\Phi_F$ together with a long prompt lifetime, which cannot be achieved by $\\mathrm{S_1}$ radiative rate increase. A physically consistent explanation requires a slower $\\mathrm{S_1}$ depopulation (e.g., reduced $k_r$ and/or $k_{nr}^{S}$) compensated by very efficient cycling via $\\mathrm{T_1}$ (elevated $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}$ and suppressed triplet loss), yielding strong Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence. The algorithm will identify the smallest subset $S$ whose variations reproduce the data within tolerance; typical minimal subsets include $\\{0,3\\}$ with an additional singlet nonradiative or intersystem crossing adjustment to meet all three observables. The recommended experiment code will reflect the presence of index $3$ (temperature dependence of delayed fluorescence).\n\nThe program implements all of the above, performs subset search with Gauss–Newton updates in log-space under the specified constraints, and outputs, for the four cases, the recommended experiment code followed by the sorted indices of the minimal varying-rate subset found.
