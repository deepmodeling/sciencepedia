The process is divided into two parts: first, the application of a group theoretical projection operator, and second, the evaluation of a normalization integral.\n\nPart 1: Application of the Projection Operator\n\nThe projection operator, $\\hat{P}^{(\\Gamma_i)}$, which projects an arbitrary function onto the subspace of functions that transform according to the irreducible representation $\\Gamma_i$ of a group $G$, is defined from the Great Orthogonality Theorem as:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(\\Gamma_i)} = \\frac{l_i}{h} \\sum_{R \\in G} \\chi^{(\\Gamma_i)}(R)^* \\hat{R} $$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group, $l_i$ is the dimension of the irreducible representation $\\Gamma_i$, $\\chi^{(\\Gamma_i)}(R)$ is the character of the symmetry operation $R$ in the representation $\\Gamma_i$, and $\\hat{R}$ is the operator corresponding to the symmetry operation $R$.\n\nFor the given problem, the group is $C_{2v}$, which consists of the operations $G = \\{E, C_{2}(z), \\sigma_{v}(xz), \\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\}$. The order of the group is $h=4$. We are interested in the totally symmetric irreducible representation $A_1$. For any group, the totally symmetric representation has a dimension of $l_{A_1}=1$ and all its characters are $\\chi^{(A_1)}(R)=1$ for all $R \\in G$. Since the characters are real, the complex conjugate is redundant, $\\chi^{(A_1)}(R)^* = \\chi^{(A_1)}(R) = 1$.\n\nThe projection operator for the $A_1$ representation is therefore:\n$$ \\hat{P}^{(A_1)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{R \\in C_{2v}} (1) \\cdot \\hat{R} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\hat{E} + \\hat{C}_{2}(z) + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}(xz) + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v}'(yz) \\right) $$\n\nTo apply this operator to the function $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2$, we must determine the action of each symmetry operator $\\hat{R}$ on the function. The action is defined by $(\\hat{R}f)(\\mathbf{r}) = f(\\hat{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{r})$. First, we establish how the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ transform under each operation. For the $C_{2v}$ group with the $z$-axis as the principal axis:\n-   Identity $\\hat{E}$: $(x,y,z) \\rightarrow (x,y,z)$\n-   Two-fold rotation $\\hat{C}_2(z)$: $(x,y,z) \\rightarrow (-x,-y,z)$\n-   Reflection $\\hat{\\sigma}_v(xz)$: $(x,y,z) \\rightarrow (x,-y,z)$\n-   Reflection $\\hat{\\sigma}_v'(yz)$: $(x,y,z) \\rightarrow (-x,y,z)$\nEach of these operations is its own inverse, i.e., $R = R^{-1}$. Thus, the action of $\\hat{R}$ on $f$ is $(\\hat{R}f)(x,y,z) = f(R(x,y,z))$.\n\nNow we apply each transformed set of coordinates to the function $f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2$:\n-   $\\hat{E}f(x,y,z) = f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2$\n-   $\\hat{C}_2(z)f(x,y,z) = f(-x,-y,z) = (-x)^2 + (-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n-   $\\hat{\\sigma}_v(xz)f(x,y,z) = f(x,-y,z) = x^2 + (-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n-   $\\hat{\\sigma}_v'(yz)f(x,y,z) = f(-x,y,z) = (-x)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nThe function $f(x,y,z)$ is invariant under all operations of the $C_{2v}$ group. This signifies that the function itself is already a basis for the $A_1$ representation. Applying the projection operator confirms this:\n$$ f_{A_1}(x,y,z) = \\hat{P}^{(A_1)}f(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (x^2+y^2) + (x^2+y^2) + (x^2+y^2) + (x^2+y^2) \\right) $$\n$$ f_{A_1}(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 4(x^2+y^2) \\right) = x^2+y^2 $$\nThe $A_1$ component of $f(x,y,z)$ is the function itself.\n\nPart 2: Normalization\n\nThe second task is to normalize the function $f_{A_1}(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2$ using the specified weighted inner product. We seek a constant $c(\\alpha)$ such that the function $\\psi(x,y,z) = c(\\alpha)f_{A_1}(x,y,z)$ satisfies $\\langle \\psi, \\psi \\rangle = 1$. The normalization condition is:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\left[ c(\\alpha) (x^2+y^2) \\right]^2 \\exp\\left(-\\alpha (x^2+y^2+z^2)\\right) d^3\\mathbf{r} = 1 $$\nThis leads to:\n$$ c(\\alpha)^{-2} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (x^2+y^2)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\alpha (x^2+y^2+z^2)\\right) dx\\,dy\\,dz $$\nThe integral is separable into components involving $x,y$ and $z$:\n$$ c(\\alpha)^{-2} = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (x^2+y^2)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\alpha (x^2+y^2)\\right) dx\\,dy \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\alpha z^2) dz \\right) $$\nLet's evaluate the two integral factors. The integral over $z$ is a standard Gaussian integral:\n$$ I_z = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\alpha z^2) dz = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} $$\nThe integral over $x$ and $y$, $I_{xy}$, is best evaluated using plane polar coordinates, where $x=r\\cos\\theta$, $y=r\\sin\\theta$, $x^2+y^2=r^2$, and $dx\\,dy = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$.\n$$ I_{xy} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (r^2)^2 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) r\\,dr\\,d\\theta $$\n$$ I_{xy} = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^5 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) dr $$\nTo solve this integral, we perform a substitution $u = \\alpha r^2$, which implies $du = 2\\alpha r\\,dr$ or $r\\,dr = du/(2\\alpha)$. The term $r^4$ becomes $(u/\\alpha)^2$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^5 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^4 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) (r\\,dr) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{u}{\\alpha}\\right)^2 \\exp(-u) \\frac{du}{2\\alpha} $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^3} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^2 \\exp(-u) du $$\nThe integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt$. Here, $z-1=2$, so $z=3$. $\\Gamma(3) = 2! = 2$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^5 \\exp(-\\alpha r^2) dr = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^3} \\Gamma(3) = \\frac{2}{2\\alpha^3} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha^3} $$\nTherefore, the $xy$-integral is:\n$$ I_{xy} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^3}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha^3} $$\nNow we combine the results for $I_{xy}$ and $I_z$:\n$$ c(\\alpha)^{-2} = I_{xy} \\cdot I_z = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha^3}\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi^{3/2}}{\\alpha^{7/2}} $$\nThe normalization constant $c(\\alpha)$, taking the positive real root, is:\n$$ c(\\alpha) = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi^{3/2}}{\\alpha^{7/2}} \\right)^{-1/2} = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^{7/2}}{2\\pi^{3/2}} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\alpha^{7/4}}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi^{3/4}} $$\nFinally, the normalized function is obtained by multiplying the projected function $f_{A_1}(x,y,z)$ by the normalization constant $c(\\alpha)$:\n$$ \\psi(x,y,z) = c(\\alpha) f_{A_1}(x,y,z) = \\frac{\\alpha^{7/4}}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi^{3/4}} (x^2+y^2) $$\nThis expression is the complete and final answer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\alpha^{7/4}}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi^{3/4}} (x^2+y^2) } $$", "id": "2643273"}, {"introduction": "A key application of group theory in physical chemistry is its power to predict spectroscopic selection rules, bridging the gap between abstract symmetry principles and concrete experimental observables.

The condition is $\\Gamma(\\Psi_f) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\Psi_i) \\supset A_{1g}$.\n\nThe given information is as follows:\n-   Initial state: $\\Psi_i$ has symmetry $\\Gamma_i = A_{1g}$ (from the ${}^1A_{1g}$ ground term).\n-   Electric dipole operator $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$: The components transform as $\\Gamma(\\mu_z) = A_{2u}$ and $\\Gamma(\\mu_x, \\mu_y) = E_u$.\n-   Therefore, for a transition from the $A_{1g}$ ground state to be allowed, the final state symmetry $\\Gamma(\\Psi_f)$ must match the symmetry of a component of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$. This is because $A_{1g}$ is the identity element in the direct product group, so the condition simplifies to $\\Gamma(\\Psi_f) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\supset A_{1g}$, which holds if and only if $\\Gamma(\\Psi_f) = \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$.\n-   Allowed final electronic state symmetries are thus $A_{2u}$ (for $z$-polarized light) and $E_u$ (for $x,y$-polarized light). Both are ungerade ($u$) states, consistent with the Laporte selection rule for a centrosymmetric complex, which mandates a change in parity ($g \\leftrightarrow u$) for electric-dipole transitions.\n\nThe transitions to the two excited states are evaluated as:\n1.  Ground state ${}^1A_{1g} \\to$ Charge-transfer state ${}^1E_u$: The final state has $E_u$ symmetry. This transition is electric-dipole allowed and polarized in the $xy$-plane.\n2.  Ground state ${}^1A_{1g} \\to$ Ligand-field state ${}^1B_{1g}$: The final state has $B_{1g}$ symmetry. Since $B_{1g}$ is not one of the allowed symmetries ($A_{2u}$ or $E_u$), this transition is forbidden. It is a $g \\to g$ transition, thus violating the Laporte rule.\n\nIntensity can be \"borrowed\" by a forbidden transition if the corresponding \"dark\" state mixes with a \"bright\" state (one for which the transition is allowed). Such mixing is induced by a perturbation term $H'$ in the Hamiltonian, and is possible only if the matrix element $\\langle \\Psi_{\\text{bright}} | H' | \\Psi_{\\text{dark}} \\rangle$ is non-zero. The group-theoretical condition for this is $\\Gamma(\\Psi_{\\text{bright}}) \\otimes \\Gamma(H') \\otimes \\Gamma(\\Psi_{\\text{dark}}) \\supset A_{1g}$.\n\nWe now analyze each statement based on these principles.\n\nA. The statement claims that electronic configuration interaction (CI) can mix the ${}^1B_{1g}$ and ${}^1E_u$ states. The perturbation operator for CI is a part of the totally symmetric electronic Hamiltonian, $H_{el}$. Therefore, $\\Gamma(H') = A_{1g}$. The condition for mixing is $\\Gamma({}^1E_u) \\otimes \\Gamma(H_{el}) \\otimes \\Gamma({}^1B_{1g}) \\supset A_{1g}$. Substituting the irreps: $E_u \\otimes A_{1g} \\otimes B_{1g} = E_u \\otimes B_{1g} = E_u$. Since $E_u \\neq A_{1g}$, the integral is zero by symmetry. The states do not mix. Consequently, the ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^1B_{1g}$ transition cannot gain intensity through this mechanism. The statement is based on a misunderstanding of basic group theory.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. This statement describes intensity borrowing via vibronic coupling, specifically the Herzberg-Teller mechanism. The forbidden electronic transition $A_{1g} \\to B_{1g}$ gains intensity by exciting a non-totally symmetric vibration. Here, an $E_u$ mode is considered. In the perturbation theory picture, the vibronic coupling Hamiltonian, $H_{vib}$, which has the symmetry of the vibrational mode, mixes the electronic states. To borrow intensity from the allowed ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^1E_u$ transition, the ${}^1B_{1g}$ state must mix with the ${}^1E_u$ state. The operator is $H_{vib}$ corresponding to the $E_u$ mode, so $\\Gamma(H') = E_u$. The mixing condition is $\\Gamma({}^1E_u) \\otimes \\Gamma(H_{vib}) \\otimes \\Gamma({}^1B_{1g}) \\supset A_{1g}$. Substituting irreps: $E_u \\otimes E_u \\otimes B_{1g} \\supset A_{1g}$. The direct product $E_u \\otimes E_u = A_{1g} + A_{2g} + B_{1g} + B_{2g}$. So we evaluate $(A_{1g} + A_{2g} + B_{1g} + B_{2g}) \\otimes B_{1g}$. This product contains the term $B_{1g} \\otimes B_{1g} = A_{1g}$. The mixing is therefore allowed by symmetry. The \"dark\" ${}^1B_{1g}$ state acquires some ${}^1E_u$ character, making the transition weakly allowed. The polarization of the borrowed intensity must be that of the \"lending\" transition, which is ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^1E_u$, i.e., $x,y$-polarized. The statement correctly identifies the mechanism, the outcome, and the polarization. The alternative framing in terms of mixing of vibronic states $|{}^1B_{1g}\\rangle \\otimes |v(E_u)\\rangle$ and $|{}^1E_u\\rangle \\otimes |v(A_{1g})\\rangle$ is also valid, as both of these states possess an overall symmetry of $E_u$ ($B_{1g} \\otimes E_u = E_u$ and $E_u \\otimes A_{1g} = E_u$) and can thus be mixed by the totally symmetric electronic Hamiltonian.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. This statement proposes a hypothetical scenario where the charge-transfer state is ${}^1A_{2u}$, making the ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^1A_{2u}$ transition the allowed intensity source ($z$-polarized). It then asks if the same $E_u$ mode can facilitate intensity borrowing for the ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^1B_{1g}$ transition. This requires mixing of the ${}^1B_{1g}$ and ${}^1A_{2u}$ electronic states by $H_{vib}$ with $\\Gamma(H_{vib}) = E_u$. The symmetry condition is $\\Gamma({}^1A_{2u}) \\otimes \\Gamma(H_{vib}) \\otimes \\Gamma({}^1B_{1g}) \\supset A_{1g}$. Substituting irreps: $A_{2u} \\otimes E_u \\otimes B_{1g} \\supset A_{1g}$. We evaluate the products: $E_u \\otimes B_{1g} = E_u$. Then, $A_{2u} \\otimes E_u = E_g$. Since $E_g \\neq A_{1g}$, the integral is zero. The $E_u$ mode cannot couple these two electronic states. No intensity borrowing can occur via this pathway. A different vibrational mode, specifically one with $B_{2u}$ symmetry (since $A_{2u} \\otimes B_{1g} = B_{2u}$), would be required. The statement is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This statement considers the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The SOC Hamiltonian, $H_{SO}$, can mix states of different spin multiplicities. The operator $H_{SO}$ transforms as the rotations $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$, which in $D_{4h}$ correspond to the irreps $E_g + A_{2g}$. Both are of gerade parity. SOC can mix the ${}^1E_u$ state with the ${}^3E_u$ state if the integral $\\langle {}^1E_u | H_{SO} | {}^3E_u \\rangle$ is non-zero. Considering the spatial parts only, the condition is $\\Gamma(E_u) \\otimes \\Gamma(H_{SO}) \\otimes \\Gamma(E_u) \\supset A_{1g}$. Let's test the $A_{2g}$ component of $H_{SO}$: $E_u \\otimes A_{2g} \\otimes E_u = A_{2g} \\otimes (E_u \\otimes E_u) = A_{2g} \\otimes (A_{1g} + A_{2g} + B_{1g} + B_{2g})$. This product contains the term $A_{2g} \\otimes A_{2g} = A_{1g}$. Thus, mixing is allowed. The nominally spin-forbidden transition ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^3E_u$ borrows intensity from the spin-allowed and Laporte-allowed transition ${}^1A_{1g} \\to {}^1E_u$. The final state remains of ungerade parity, so the transition is $g \\to u$, satisfying the Laporte rule. The statement that this occurs \"without violating inversion-based selection rules\" is correct, as parity is conserved in the overall transition moment integral: $\\Gamma(\\text{final u-state}) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\text{u-operator}) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\text{initial g-state}) = u \\otimes u \\otimes g = g$, which can contain $A_{1g}$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. This statement invokes the Laporte selection rule in the absence of any mechanism that breaks the molecular inversion symmetry. The perturbations are restricted to CI among states of the same ($g$) parity. Any linear combination of $g$-symmetry states, $\\Psi_f = \\sum_k c_k \\psi_{g,k}$, is itself a $g$-symmetry state. The transition is from a $g$-symmetry ground state (${}^1A_{1g}$) to a $g$-symmetry excited state. The electric dipole operator $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ has $u$-symmetry. The transition moment integral is $\\langle \\Psi_f(g) | \\boldsymbol{\\mu}(u) | \\Psi_i(g) \\rangle$. The integrand has overall symmetry $g \\otimes u \\otimes g = u$. In a centrosymmetric point group, the integral over all space of any function with ungerade symmetry is identically zero. Therefore, no amount of CI between $g$-states can make a $g \\to g$ transition allowed. The total electric-dipole intensity for transitions into the manifold of all $g$-symmetry states is, and must remain, zero. This statement is a direct and correct consequence of the parity selection rule.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2643284"}]}
