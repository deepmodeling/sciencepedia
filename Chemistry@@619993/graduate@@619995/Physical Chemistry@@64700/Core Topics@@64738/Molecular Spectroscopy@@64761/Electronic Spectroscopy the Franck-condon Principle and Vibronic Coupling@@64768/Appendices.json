The nuclear motion is described by the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator.\n\nFor mathematical convenience, we introduce a dimensionless coordinate $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{\\hbar}} Q$. The displacement in this coordinate is $\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{\\hbar}} \\Delta Q$. The Huang-Rhys factor $S = \\frac{m\\omega \\Delta Q^2}{2\\hbar}$ is related to $\\delta$ by $S = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^2$, which implies $\\delta = \\sqrt{2S}$.\n\nThe vibrational wavefunctions for the ground electronic state, $|\\psi_g^v\\rangle$, are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_g = \\frac{\\hat{p}_Q^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 Q^2$.

Let $|\\psi_g^v\\rangle = |v_g\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_e^{v'}\\rangle = |v'_e\\rangle$. The ladder operators for the ground state potential (centered at $Q=0$) are $\\hat{a}_g$ and $\\hat{a}_g^\\dagger$. The ground state $|0_g\\rangle$ is defined by $\\hat{a}_g|0_g\\rangle=0$.

We can find this by expressing the state $|0_g\\rangle$ in the basis of the excited state vibrational levels, $\\{|v'_e\\rangle\\}$. The state $|0_g\\rangle$ is annihilated by the operator $\\hat{a}_g$. We can re-express this condition using the excited state operators:\n$$ \\hat{a}_g |0_g\\rangle = (\\hat{a}_e + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2}})|0_g\\rangle = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\hat{a}_e |0_g\\rangle = -\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2}} |0_g\\rangle $$\nThis equation shows that the state $|0_g\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator $\\hat{a}_e$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha = -\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2}}$.

The FCFs are already normalized. Thus, the distribution of relative FC intensities is a Poisson distribution with parameter $S$:\n$$ P(v') = \\frac{e^{-S} S^{v'}}{v'!} $$\nNow, we apply this result to the specific case where $S=1.5$.

The vibrational frequency is a typical value for such a molecule.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds from first principles, based on the specified displaced harmonic oscillator model. The potential energy surfaces for the electronic ground state ($g$) and excited state ($e$) are represented by two parabolas with identical curvature (i.e., identical force constants and vibrational frequencies, $\\omega_g = \\omega_e = \\omega_{\\text{eff}}$), displaced horizontally by $\\delta Q$ along a single effective normal coordinate $Q$ and vertically by the zero-point electronic energy difference $E_{00}$.\n\nThe potential energy functions are:\n$$V_g(Q) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega_{\\text{eff}}^2 Q^2$$\n$$V_e(Q) = E_{00} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega_{\\text{eff}}^2 (Q - \\delta Q)^2$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass for the effective mode.\n\nUnder the Franck-Condon principle, electronic transitions are vertical on this coordinate diagram, meaning they occur with no change in the nuclear coordinate $Q$. At low temperature, absorption originates from the lowest vibrational level ($v=0$) of the ground electronic state, where the equilibrium geometry is $Q=0$. Emission originates from the lowest vibrational level ($v'=0$) of the excited electronic state, where the equilibrium geometry is $Q=\\delta Q$, following vibrational relaxation.\n\nThe intensity of a vibronic transition $v' \\leftrightarrow v$ is proportional to the Franck-Condon factor, which is the squared overlap integral of the vibrational wavefunctions, $|\\langle \\chi_{v'} | \\chi_{v} \\rangle|^2$. For the displaced harmonic oscillator model, the vibronic transition with the maximum intensity (the band maximum) corresponds to a change in vibrational quantum number approximately equal to the Huang-Rhys factor, $S$.\n\nThus, for absorption ($v=0 \\to v' \\approx S$), the energy of the band maximum is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{abs,max}} \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_{00} + S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}$$\nFor emission ($v'=0 \\to v \\approx S$), the energy of the band maximum is:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{em,max}} \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_{00} - S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}$$\nHere, energies are expressed in wavenumbers ($\\text{cm}^{-1}$), and $\\tilde{\\nu}_{00}$ is the wavenumber corresponding to the $0-0$ transition energy $E_{00}$.\n\nThe Stokes shift, $\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}}$, is the difference between the absorption and emission maxima:\n$$\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{abs,max}} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{em,max}} = (\\tilde{\\nu}_{00} + S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}) - (\\tilde{\\nu}_{00} - S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}) = 2 S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}$$\n\nThe reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, is the energy lost due to nuclear relaxation in the excited state. It is the difference in potential energy between the Franck-Condon geometry ($Q=0$) and the relaxed geometry ($Q=\\delta Q$) on the excited state surface:\n$$\\lambda = V_e(Q=0) - V_e(Q=\\delta Q) = \\left( E_{00} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega_{\\text{eff}}^2 (0 - \\delta Q)^2 \\right) - E_{00} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu \\omega_{\\text{eff}}^2 (\\delta Q)^2$$\nThe Huang-Rhys factor $S$ is defined as the reorganization energy divided by the energy of one vibrational quantum:\n$$S = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\hbar \\omega_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{h c \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nIn terms of wavenumbers, let $\\tilde{\\lambda}$ be the Reorganization energy in $\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Then $\\lambda = hc\\tilde{\\lambda}$, and the relationship simplifies to:\n$$S = \\frac{hc\\tilde{\\lambda}}{hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\lambda}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nFrom this, we have $\\tilde{\\lambda} = S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the derived expression for the Stokes shift:\n$$\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = 2 S \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{\\lambda}}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}}} \\right) \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{eff}} = 2 \\tilde{\\lambda}$$\nThis provides the fundamental relationship between the reorganization energy and the Stokes shift for this model: the reorganization energy is exactly half of the Stokes shift energy.\n$$\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}}$$\n\nNow, we compute the required quantities.\nFirst, calculate the Stokes shift in wavenumbers from the given data:\n$$\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{Stokes}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{abs,max}} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{em,max}} = 23750\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} - 19990\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 3760\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\nNext, calculate the reorganization energy in wavenumbers:\n$$\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} (3760\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}) = 1880\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nTo convert $\\tilde{\\lambda}$ to $\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$, we use the relation $E = N_A h c \\tilde{\\nu}$.

Substituting these into the expression for the vibronic transition moment gives:\n$$\nM_{0 \\to v'} = \\langle v' \\lvert \\alpha Q \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\alpha \\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle\n$$\nTo evaluate the matrix element $\\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle$, we express the position operator $\\hat{Q}$ in terms of the lowering (annihilation) operator $\\hat{a}$ and the raising (creation) operator $\\hat{a}^\\dagger$ for the harmonic oscillator:\n$$\n\\hat{Q} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{a})\n$$\nThe actions of these operators on the vibrational eigenstates $\\lvert n \\rangle$ are given by:\n$$\n\\hat{a} \\lvert n \\rangle = \\sqrt{n} \\lvert n-1 \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\lvert n \\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1} \\lvert n+1 \\rangle\n$$\nThe states are orthonormal, satisfying $\\langle m \\lvert n \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$.\nWe now compute the matrix element:\n$$\n\\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\langle v' \\lvert (\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{a}) \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\left( \\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\rvert 0 \\rangle + \\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{a} \\rvert 0 \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nLet us evaluate each term in the sum. For the first term:\n$$\n\\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\langle v' \\lvert \\sqrt{0+1} \\rvert 1 \\rangle = \\langle v' \\lvert 1 \\rangle = \\delta_{v',1}\n$$\nFor the second term:\n$$\n\\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{a} \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\langle v' \\lvert \\sqrt{0} \\rvert -1 \\rangle = 0\n$$\nCombining these results, we find:\n$$\n\\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} (\\delta_{v',1} + 0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\delta_{v',1}\n$$\nThis result immediately provides the selection rule for the transition from the vibrational ground state $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$. The matrix element is non-zero only if $v'=1$. Therefore, the selection rule is $\\Delta v = v' - 0 = +1$.\n\nAs requested, we evaluate this matrix element for $v'=0, 1, 2$:\nFor $v'=0$: $\\langle 0 \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\delta_{0,1} = 0$.\nFor $v'=1$: $\\langle 1 \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\delta_{1,1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}}$.\nFor $v'=2$: $\\langle 2 \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\delta_{2,1} = 0$.\n\nThe absorption intensity, or line strength, for a vibronic transition $0 \\to v'$ is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the vibronic transition moment, $|M_{0 \\to v'}|^2$.\n$$\nI_{0 \\to v'} \\propto |M_{0 \\to v'}|^2 = |\\alpha \\langle v' \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle|^2 = \\alpha^2 \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\delta_{v',1} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\hbar}{2\\omega} \\delta_{v',1}^2\n$$\nThis shows that the intensity is non-zero only for the $v'=1$ final state. All other transitions from the $v=0$ state are forbidden in this model. The transition $0 \\to 1$ is thus the only allowed transition, making it, by definition, the dominant one.\n\nFinally, we compute the vibronic line strength for the $0 \\to 1$ transition. Setting $v'=1$:\n$$\nI_{0 \\to 1} \\propto |M_{0 \\to 1}|^2 = \\alpha^2 |\\langle 1 \\lvert \\hat{Q} \\rvert 0 \\rangle|^2 = \\alpha^2 \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\hbar}{2\\omega}\n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the line strength, up to a common proportionality constant that includes fundamental constants and orientational averaging factors.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha^{2} \\hbar}{2 \\omega}}\n$$", "id": "2637752"}]}
