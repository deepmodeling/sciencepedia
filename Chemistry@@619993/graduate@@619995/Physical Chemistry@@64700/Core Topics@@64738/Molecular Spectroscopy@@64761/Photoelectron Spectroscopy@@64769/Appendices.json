This practice explores the phenomenon of spin-orbit coupling, which lifts the degeneracy of core levels with non-zero orbital angular momentum (i.e., $p$, $d$, $f$ orbitals), causing a single peak to split into a doublet. This exercise [@problem_id:2010434] focuses on how the intensity ratio of these split peaks is governed by the electronic degeneracy, $2j+1$, of the final states, a key principle for correctly assigning and interpreting complex spectra.", "problem": "An experiment using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is performed on a pure gold (Au) sample to study its core-level electronic structure. A high-resolution scan of the energy region corresponding to the 4f orbitals reveals that the peak is not a single feature, but is split into a doublet due to spin-orbit coupling. According to the standard model of photoionization for core levels, the integrated intensity of each peak in this doublet is directly proportional to the total electronic degeneracy of the final state (i.e., the hole state) it represents. Based on this principle, determine the expected theoretical intensity ratio of the peak observed at the lower binding energy to the peak observed at the higher binding energy.\n\nSelect the correct ratio from the options below.\n\nA. $3 : 4$\n\nB. $4 : 3$\n\nC. $2 : 3$\n\nD. $3 : 2$\n\nE. $1 : 2$\n\nF. $1 : 1$", "solution": "The problem asks for the theoretical intensity ratio of the two peaks arising from the spin-orbit splitting of the 4f core level in gold.\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant quantum numbers for a 4f electron.\nFor an electron in a 4f orbital, the principal quantum number is $n=4$, and the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=3$. All electrons have a spin angular momentum quantum number of $s=1/2$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total angular momentum quantum numbers due to spin-orbit coupling.\nSpin-orbit coupling involves the vector addition of the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ and the spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$ to form the total angular momentum $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$. The magnitude of this total angular momentum is quantized by the total angular momentum quantum number, $j$. The possible values of $j$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n$$j = |l-s|, |l-s|+1, \\dots, l+s$$\nFor a 4f electron with $l=3$ and $s=1/2$, the possible values for $j$ are:\n$$j = |3 - \\frac{1}{2}|, \\dots, 3 + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$j = \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}$$\nThis means the 4f level splits into two distinct sublevels, which are commonly denoted as $4f_{5/2}$ and $4f_{7/2}$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the degeneracy of each sublevel.\nThe degeneracy of a state with a given total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is given by the formula $g_j = 2j+1$. This counts the number of possible projections of the total angular momentum vector onto a quantization axis.\nFor the $j=5/2$ sublevel:\n$$g_{5/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$$\nFor the $j=7/2$ sublevel:\n$$g_{7/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8$$\nSo, the 4f level, which initially has a total degeneracy of $2(2l+1) = 2(2(3)+1) = 14$ electrons, splits into a sublevel that can hold 6 electrons and another that can hold 8 electrons.\n\nStep 4: Relate the sublevels to the binding energies of the XPS peaks.\nIn atoms, spin-orbit coupling rules (part of Hund's rules for term symbols) state that for a subshell that is less than half-filled, the level with the lowest $j$ is lowest in energy. For a subshell that is more than half-filled, the level with the highest $j$ is lowest in energy. Photoemission creates a \"hole\" in a filled core shell. A filled shell corresponds to the \"more than half-filled\" case. Therefore, the final state with the hole in the $j=7/2$ level is more stable (lower in energy) than the final state with the hole in the $j=5/2$ level. A more stable final state requires less energy to create, which corresponds to a lower binding energy for the ejected photoelectron.\nThus:\n- The peak at lower binding energy corresponds to the $4f_{7/2}$ final state.\n- The peak at higher binding energy corresponds to the $4f_{5/2}$ final state.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the intensity ratio.\nThe problem states that the intensity of each peak is proportional to the degeneracy of its corresponding final state. We need to find the ratio of the intensity of the lower-binding-energy peak to the higher-binding-energy peak.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{I(\\text{lower binding energy})}{I(\\text{higher binding energy})} = \\frac{I(4f_{7/2})}{I(4f_{5/2})} $$\nUsing the degeneracies calculated in Step 3:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{g_{7/2}}{g_{5/2}} = \\frac{8}{6} $$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\nThis corresponds to an intensity ratio of $4:3$.\n\nStep 6: Match the result to the given options.\nThe calculated ratio $4:3$ matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2010434"}, {"introduction": "In practical applications, especially in materials science, identifying the precise chemical state of an element on a surface is crucial.

The calculated value, 1849.2, has five significant figures. Let's re-examine the precision of the input data. Both input values (932.5 and 916.7) are given to one decimal place. Standard rules for addition would suggest the result should also be reported to one decimal place. The value 1849.2 has one decimal place. Also, since the inputs have four significant figures, it is reasonable to provide the answer with at least that many. Reporting 1849.2 retains appropriate precision. Let's reassess the rounding requirement. \"Rounded to four significant figures\" implies that 1849.2 should be rounded to 1849.\n\nRecalculating with the rounding instruction applied:\nThe calculated value is 1849.2 eV.\nRounding this to four significant figures gives 1849 eV.\n\nLet's double-check the conventions. The sum of numbers with a certain number of decimal places should have the same number of decimal places. Both inputs are to 0.1 eV. The sum is 1849.2 eV. If we strictly follow the significant figures rule for addition/subtraction, it's about decimal places. The result should be reported to one decimal place, which is $1849.2$. This has five significant figures. The problem statement explicitly says \"rounded to four significant figures.\" This instruction overrides the general rule for addition.

Often in such problems, the input data is considered exact or the precision is implicitly tied to the requested output format. 1849.2 is a five-significant-figure number. It's possible the prompt meant \"at least four significant figures\" or that there is a slight ambiguity. Let's analyze the phrasing \"rounded to four significant figures.\" This is a direct instruction. 1849.2 rounded to four significant figures is 1849.\n\nLet's do the calculation again.\n$E_{\\text{sum}} = 916.7 + 932.5 = 1849.2$\nRounding 1849.2 to four significant figures: The first four significant figures are 1, 8, 4, 9. The next digit is 2. Since 2 < 5, we round down, and the number becomes 1849.\n\nLet's think if there's a subtle point missed. The values for $Cu_2O$ are indeed around these numbers, and the accepted $\\alpha'$ is typically quoted as 1849.1 eV or 1849.2 eV in literature. The rounding instruction to four significant figures might be a deliberate step to test rounding rules.
