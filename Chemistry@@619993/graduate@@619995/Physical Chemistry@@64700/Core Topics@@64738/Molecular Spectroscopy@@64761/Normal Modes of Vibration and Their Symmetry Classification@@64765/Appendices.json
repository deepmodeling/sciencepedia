It provides a self-contained, standard exercise in the application of group theory to determine the symmetries of molecular vibrations. All necessary information, including the molecular geometry, point group, coordinate system, character table, and basis functions, is provided and is consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to determine the irreducible representations that constitute the vibrational modes of the $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ molecule. This is achieved by first constructing the reducible representation for all $3N$ Cartesian displacements, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, where $N$ is the number of atoms. For $\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$, $N=3$. The vibrational representation, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, is then found by subtracting the representations for overall translation, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, and overall rotation, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}}$, from $\\Gamma_{3N}$.\n\nThe character of the representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ for a given symmetry operation $R$, denoted $\\chi_{3N}(R)$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$\n\\chi_{3N}(R) = N_u(R) \\cdot \\chi_{\\text{cart}}(R)\n$$\nwhere $N_u(R)$ is the number of atoms that are not moved by the operation $R$, and $\\chi_{\\text{cart}}(R)$ is the character of the $3 \\times 3$ matrix that transforms the Cartesian basis vectors $(x, y, z)$.\n\nWe will evaluate this for each of the four symmetry operations of the $C_{2v}$ point group: $E, C_{2}(z), \\sigma_{v}(xz), \\sigma_{v}'(yz)$.\n\n1.  **Operation $E$ (Identity):**\n    All $3$ atoms are unshifted, so $N_u(E) = 3$.\n    The identity operation matrix is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix, whose trace is $1+1+1=3$. So, $\\chi_{\\text{cart}}(E) = 3$.\n    Therefore, $\\chi_{3N}(E) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Operation $C_{2}(z)$ ($180^\\circ$ rotation about the $z$-axis):**\n    The $z$-axis passes only through the oxygen atom. The two hydrogen atoms are interchanged. Thus, only $1$ atom is unshifted: $N_u(C_{2}) = 1$.\n    The transformation for the coordinates is $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, z)$. The matrix has a trace of $-1 + (-1) + 1 = -1$. So, $\\chi_{\\text{cart}}(C_{2}) = -1$.\n    Therefore, $\\chi_{3N}(C_{2}) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n\n3.  **Operation $\\sigma_{v}(xz)$ (reflection in the $xz$-plane):**\n    The $\\sigma_v(xz)$ plane is perpendicular to the molecular plane. It contains the $z$-axis (the angle bisector) and reflects the two hydrogen atoms into each other. Therefore, only the central oxygen atom, which lies on the plane, is unshifted by this operation. Thus, $N_u(\\sigma_{v}(xz)) = 1$.\n    The transformation for the coordinates is $(x, y, z) \\to (x, -y, z)$. The matrix has a trace of $1 + (-1) + 1 = 1$.

All $3$ atoms lie within this plane and are therefore unshifted. Thus, $N_u(\\sigma_{v}'(yz)) = 3$.\n    The transformation is $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, y, z)$. The matrix has a trace of $-1 + 1 + 1 = 1$. So, $\\chi_{\\text{cart}}(\\sigma_{v}'(yz)) = 1$.\n    Therefore, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_{v}'(yz)) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\nCombining these results, the characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ are:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{3N} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 & -1 & 1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the representations for translation and rotation. The translational degrees of freedom transform as the Cartesian axes $x, y, z$. The rotational degrees of freedom transform as the rotations about these axes, $R_x, R_y, R_z$. From the provided character table:\n- $z$ transforms as $A_1$.\n- $x$ transforms as $B_1$.\n- $y$ transforms as $B_2$.\nSo, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}} = A_1 \\oplus B_1 \\oplus B_2$.

The elements are $G_{ij} = B_i M^{-1} B_j^{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n$$G_{11} = B_1 M^{-1} B_1^{\\mathrm{T}} = (-1)(\\tfrac{1}{m_A})(-1) + (1)(\\tfrac{1}{m_B})(1) = \\dfrac{1}{m_A} + \\dfrac{1}{m_B}$$\nSince $B_1 = B_2$, it follows that $G_{12} = G_{21} = G_{22} = G_{11}$.\nLet $\\mu^{-1} = \\frac{1}{m_A} + \\frac{1}{m_B}$ be the inverse of the reduced mass. The $G$ matrix is:\n$$G = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu^{-1} & \\mu^{-1} \\\\ \\mu^{-1} & \\mu^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{m_A} + \\dfrac{1}{m_B}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(G - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu^{-1} - \\lambda & \\mu^{-1} \\\\ \\mu^{-1} & \\mu^{-1} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\n$$(\\mu^{-1} - \\lambda)^2 - (\\mu^{-1})^2 = 0$$\n$$\\lambda^2 - 2\\mu^{-1}\\lambda + (\\mu^{-1})^2 - (\\mu^{-1})^2 = 0$$\n$$\\lambda(\\lambda - 2\\mu^{-1}) = 0$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2\\mu^{-1} = 2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{m_A} + \\dfrac{1}{m_B}\\right)$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$.\n\nThe presence of a zero eigenvalue in the $G$ matrix signifies a linear redundancy in the set of internal coordinates. The number of zero eigenvalues corresponds to the number of redundancies. Here, one zero eigenvalue indicates one redundancy.\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2=0$, defines the redundant combination of coordinates. Let the eigenvector be $\\mathbf{v}_2 = (v_1, v_2)^{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n$$(G - 0 \\cdot I)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\mu^{-1}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis gives the relation $v_1 + v_2 = 0$, so the eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -1)^{\\mathrm{T}}$. This corresponds to the linear combination $S_{red} = q_1 - q_2$. Since $q_1 = q_2 = r_{AB}$, this combination is identically zero, confirming it represents the redundancy.\n\nThe eigenvector corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1 = 2\\mu^{-1}$, defines the non-redundant, physically meaningful coordinate. Let this be $\\mathbf{v}_1 = (v_1, v_2)^{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n$$(G - 2\\mu^{-1} I)\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu^{-1} - 2\\mu^{-1} & \\mu^{-1} \\\\ \\mu^{-1} & \\mu^{-1} - 2\\mu^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0}$$\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu^{-1} & \\mu^{-1} \\\\ \\mu^{-1} & -\\mu^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nThis gives the relation $-v_1 + v_2 = 0$ or $v_1 = v_2$. The eigenvector is proportional to $(1, 1)^{\\mathrm{T}}$. This corresponds to the linear combination $S_{phys} = q_1 + q_2$. This is the valid vibrational coordinate.\n\nTo remove the redundancy, one projects out the null-space of $G$, spanned by the eigenvectors with zero eigenvalues. The physical analysis proceeds in the space spanned by the eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A.** $G = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{m_A} + \\dfrac{1}{m_B}\\right)\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda = 2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{m_A} + \\dfrac{1}{m_B}\\right)$ and $\\lambda = 0$. The zero eigenvalue signals that one linear combination of $\\{q_1,q_2\\}$ is redundant; remove the null-space direction proportional to $(1,-1)^{\\mathrm{T}}$ and retain the nonredundant combination proportional to $(1,1)^{\\mathrm{T}}$ (e.g., $q' = (q_1+q_2)/\\sqrt{2}$).\n    This statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The form of $G$, its eigenvalues, and the interpretation of the redundancy and its removal are all correct. The eigenvector for the zero eigenvalue is proportional to $(1, -1)^{\\mathrm{T}}$ and the eigenvector for the non-zero eigenvalue is proportional to $(1, 1)^{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n    **Verdict: Correct**.\n\n*   **B.** $G$ is diagonal with $G_{11} = G_{22} = \\dfrac{1}{m_A} + \\dfrac{1}{m_B}$ and no off-diagonal elements; the absence of zero eigenvalues shows there is no redundancy to remove.\n    Our calculation shows that $G$ has non-zero off-diagonal elements, $G_{12} = G_{21} = \\frac{1}{m_A} + \\frac{1}{m_B}$. Furthermore, our calculation shows there is a zero eigenvalue. The conclusion that there is no redundancy is incorrect, as the setup explicitly defines one.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C.** Any zero eigenvalue of $G$ necessarily originates from overall translations or rotations; redundant internal coordinates are instead detected from the force-constant matrix in internal coordinates, not from $G$.\n    This statement is fundamentally flawed. Zero eigenvalues of the $G$ matrix arise from linear dependencies within the chosen set of internal coordinates. They are a property of the molecular geometry and the coordinate definitions, entirely independent of the potential energy surface (and thus the force-constant matrix $F$). Zero frequencies of vibration, which correspond to translations and rotations, are found from the eigenvalues of the product matrix $GF$ (or the mass-weighted Cartesian force constant matrix). The claim that redundancies are detected from the $F$ matrix is incorrect; the $G$ matrix is the standard tool for this purpose.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D.** Because $G$ is positive definite by construction, it cannot have zero eigenvalues; the correct procedure is to retain all internal coordinates and later impose holonomic constraints to eliminate any redundancies.\n    The $G$ matrix is positive *semi-definite*, not strictly positive definite. It is only positive definite if the internal coordinates form a linearly independent set. The possibility of zero eigenvalues is a crucial feature, as it is the mechanism by which redundancies are detected. While using holonomic constraints is an alternative theoretical approach, the statement that $G$ cannot have zero eigenvalues is false and contradicts the standard use of Wilson's methodology.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2655957"}]}
