It describes a standard and fundamental case in EPR spectroscopy. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\n**1. The Spin Hamiltonian**\nIn the high-field approximation for an isotropic system, the spin Hamiltonian $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}$ is dominated by the electron Zeeman and the isotropic hyperfine interactions. It is given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = g \\beta_e B_0 \\hat{S}_z + a \\hat{\\mathbf{S}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{I}} $$\nwhere $g$ is the isotropic g-factor, $\\beta_e$ is the Bohr magneton, $B_0$ is the external magnetic field aligned along the $z$-axis, $\\hat{S}_z$ is the electron spin operator component along $z$, $a$ is the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{I}}$ are the electron and nuclear spin operators, respectively.\n\n**2. Energy Levels**\nWe use first-order perturbation theory, where the electron Zeeman term is the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the hyperfine term is the perturbation. The basis states are product functions $|m_S, m_I\\rangle$, where $m_S$ is the electron spin magnetic quantum number ($m_S = \\pm 1/2$) and $m_I$ is the nuclear spin magnetic quantum number ($m_I = -I, \\dots, +I$). For $I=1$, $m_I = -1, 0, +1$.\n\nIn the high-field limit, the main contribution from the isotropic hyperfine term $a \\hat{\\mathbf{S}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{I}} = a(\\hat{S}_x\\hat{I}_x + \\hat{S}_y\\hat{I}_y + \\hat{S}_z\\hat{I}_z)$ comes from the secular part, $a \\hat{S}_z \\hat{I}_z$. The non-secular terms ($\\hat{S}_x\\hat{I}_x, \\hat{S}_y\\hat{I}_y$) are neglected in a first-order treatment.\n\nThe energy of a state $|m_S, m_I\\rangle$ is then:\n$$ E(m_S, m_I) = \\langle m_S, m_I | \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} | m_S, m_I \\rangle \\approx g \\beta_e B_0 m_S + a m_S m_I $$\nThis gives a total of $(2S+1)(2I+1) = (2(1/2)+1)(2(1)+1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$ energy levels.\n\n**3. EPR Transitions and Selection Rules**\nFor a standard CW EPR experiment, the interaction with the microwave radiation induces transitions between electron spin states. The magnetic dipole selection rules are:\n$$ \\Delta m_S = \\pm 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta m_I = 0 $$\nThe condition $\\Delta m_I = 0$ means that the nuclear spin orientation does not change during the electron spin flip. Consequently, we must consider transitions for each possible value of $m_I$ separately.\n\n**4. Resonance Condition and Multiplet Pattern**\nAn EPR transition occurs when the energy difference $\\Delta E$ between the initial and final states matches the energy of the microwave photon, $h\\nu$.\n$$ \\Delta E = E(m_S=+1/2, m_I) - E(m_S=-1/2, m_I) = h\\nu $$\nSubstituting the energy expression:\n$$ \\Delta E = [g \\beta_e B_0 (1/2) + a (1/2) m_I] - [g \\beta_e B_0 (-1/2) + a (-1/2) m_I] $$\n$$ \\Delta E = g \\beta_e B_0 + a m_I $$\nThe resonance condition is $h\\nu = g \\beta_e B_{\\text{res}} + a m_I$. Since the experiment is field-swept at a fixed frequency $\\nu$, we solve for the resonance field $B_{\\text{res}}$:\n$$ B_{\\text{res}} = \\frac{h\\nu - a m_I}{g \\beta_e} $$\nSince $I=1$, the quantum number $m_I$ can take three values: $-1, 0, +1$. This leads to three distinct resonance fields:\n*   For $m_I = +1$: $B_1 = \\frac{h\\nu - a}{g \\beta_e}$\n*   For $m_I = 0$: $B_2 = \\frac{h\\nu}{g \\beta_e}$\n*   For $m_I = -1$: $B_3 = \\frac{h\\nu + a}{g \\beta_e}$\n\nThis demonstrates that the spectrum consists of a triplet (three lines). The spacing between adjacent lines is:\n$$ \\Delta B = |B_2 - B_1| = \\left|\\frac{h\\nu}{g \\beta_e} - \\frac{h\\nu - a}{g \\beta_e}\\right| = \\frac{|a|}{g \\beta_e} $$\n$$ \\Delta B = |B_3 - B_2| = \\left|\\frac{h\\nu + a}{g \\beta_e} - \\frac{h\\nu}{g \\beta_e}\\right| = \\frac{|a|}{g \\beta_e} $$\nThe lines are equally spaced, with a separation known as the hyperfine splitting constant (in field units).\n\n**5. Relative Intensities**\nThe integrated intensity of each transition is proportional to the transition probability and the population of the initial state.\n*   **Transition Probability**: For allowed EPR transitions ($\\Delta m_S = \\pm 1, \\Delta m_I = 0$), the transition matrix element is, to first order, independent of the nuclear spin state $m_I$. Thus, the intrinsic probability is the same for all three transitions.\n*   **Population**: The intensity also depends on the population of the initial states, which are the levels with $m_S = -1/2$. At typical experimental temperatures, the energy splittings within the $m_S = -1/2$ manifold due to the hyperfine interaction are very small compared to the thermal energy, $k_B T$. The energy difference between states $|-1/2, m_I\\rangle$ and $|-1/2, m'_I\\rangle$ is $|a/2 (m_I - m'_I)|$, which is negligible. Therefore, the populations of the three initial states ($|-1/2, +1\\rangle$, $|-1/2, 0\\rangle$, and $|-1/2, -1\\rangle$) are effectively equal.\n\nSince each of the three allowed transitions has the same intrinsic probability and originates from an equally populated initial level, the resulting spectral lines will have equal integrated intensities. The relative intensity ratio is $1:1:1$.\n\n**Conclusion**: The analysis based on first principles predicts a triplet of equally spaced lines with relative integrated intensities of $1:1:1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A triplet of equally spaced lines with relative integrated intensities $1:1:1$.**\nThis statement matches the derived result precisely. The coupling of an $S=1/2$ electron to a single $I=1$ nucleus produces $2I+1 = 3$ lines. The first-order perturbation treatment shows them to be equally spaced. The equal degeneracy (one state for each $m_I$) and nearly identical thermal populations of the initial states lead to a $1:1:1$ intensity ratio.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A triplet of equally spaced lines with relative integrated intensities $1:2:1$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the number of lines and their spacing but incorrectly states the intensities. An intensity ratio of $1:2:1$ typically arises from coupling to two equivalent $I=1/2$ nuclei, where the central line's intensity is enhanced due to the degeneracy of the total nuclear spin projection $M_I=0$ (which can be formed in two ways: $\\uparrow\\downarrow$ and $\\downarrow\\uparrow$). This is not the case for a single $I=1$ nucleus, where each $m_I$ state is non-degenerate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A quintet of equally spaced lines with relative integrated intensities $1:2:3:2:1$.**\nA quintet ($5$ lines) would result from coupling to a nucleus with $I=2$, or two equivalent nuclei with $I=1$. The problem specifies a single nucleus with $I=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A doublet of equally spaced lines with relative integrated intensities $1:1$.**\nA doublet ($2$ lines) results from coupling to a single nucleus with $I=1/2$. The problem specifies $I=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A sextet of equally spaced lines with relative integrated intensities $1:1:1:1:1:1$.**\nA sextet ($6$ lines) results from coupling to a single nucleus with $I=5/2$. The problem specifies $I=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2636422"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of hyperfine coupling, this next practice demonstrates a powerful experimental technique: isotopic substitution.

The scenario described is a classic experiment in physical chemistry. The provided values for nuclear spins and magnetic moments are consistent with established data. The postulate that fast tumbling in an isotropic liquid averages anisotropic interactions to yield an isotropic hyperfine coupling is a fundamental concept in solution-state magnetic resonance. The assumption of constant electron spin density upon isotopic substitution is a direct consequence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and is standard practice for such problems. The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary information to calculate the hyperfine pattern for the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ isotope based on the $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ data. The language used is objective and precise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe primary interaction causing the splitting of the EPR line is the isotropic hyperfine coupling between the electron spin $\\vec{S}$ and the nuclear spin $\\vec{I}$. In the high-field approximation, the spin Hamiltonian term for this interaction is $A_{iso} \\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{I}$, which simplifies to $A_{iso} S_z I_z$. The energy levels of the spin system are given by:\n$$ E(m_S, m_I) = g_e \\beta_e B m_S - g_N \\beta_N B m_I + A_{iso} m_S m_I $$\nwhere $m_S$ and $m_I$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for the electron and nuclear spins, respectively.\n\nThe EPR transitions obey the selection rules $\\Delta m_S = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m_I = 0$. The energy of a transition from $m_S = -1/2$ to $m_S = +1/2$ for a given nuclear state $m_I$ is:\n$$ \\Delta E = h\\nu = g_e \\beta_e B + A_{iso} m_I $$\nIn a continuous-wave experiment at fixed frequency $\\nu$, the magnetic field $B$ is swept. The resonance condition is met at fields $B_{res}$ that depend on $m_I$:\n$$ B_{res}(m_I) = \\frac{h\\nu}{g_e \\beta_e} - \\frac{A_{iso}}{g_e \\beta_e}m_I $$\nThe hyperfine lines are centered around $B_0 = h\\nu / (g_e \\beta_e)$, and their separation depends on the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant, $A_{iso}$ (in energy units). The spacing between adjacent lines in magnetic field units is $\\Delta B = |a|$, where $a = A_{iso} / (g_e \\beta_e)$ is the hyperfine coupling constant in mT.\n\nThe number of hyperfine lines is given by $2I+1$.\n\nThe isotropic hyperfine coupling constant, $A_{iso}$, is directly proportional to the nuclear magnetogyric ratio, $\\gamma_N$, and the unpaired electron spin density at the nucleus, $|\\psi(0)|^2$.\n$$ A_{iso} \\propto \\gamma_N |\\psi(0)|^2 $$\nThe nuclear magnetogyric ratio is related to the nuclear magnetic moment $\\mu$ and nuclear spin $I$ by $\\mu = \\gamma_N \\hbar I$. Thus, $\\gamma_N = \\mu / (\\hbar I)$, which implies:\n$$ A_{iso} \\propto \\frac{\\mu}{I} |\\psi(0)|^2 $$\nSince the problem states that the electron spin density $|\\psi(0)|^2$ is unchanged upon isotopic substitution, the ratio of the hyperfine coupling constants for $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ and $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{A_{15}}{A_{14}} = \\frac{\\mu(^{15}\\mathrm{N})/I(^{15}\\mathrm{N})}{\\mu(^{14}\\mathrm{N})/I(^{14}\\mathrm{N})} $$\n\n**Analysis for $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$**\nFor the $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ isotope, $I=1$. The number of lines is $2(1)+1=3$. The nuclear spin states are $m_I = -1, 0, +1$. This results in a triplet of equally intense and equally spaced lines, which is consistent with the problem statement. The observed spacing is $\\Delta B_{14} = 1.60\\,\\mathrm{mT}$.\n\n**Prediction for $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$**\n1.  **Number of lines:** For the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ isotope, $I=1/2$. The number of lines will be $2(1/2)+1=2$. The spectrum is a doublet, corresponding to $m_I = -1/2$ and $m_I = +1/2$.\n\n2.  **Hyperfine Splitting:** We calculate the ratio of the hyperfine constants.\n    $$ \\frac{A_{15}}{A_{14}} = \\frac{(-0.28319\\,\\mu_{\\mathrm{N}}) / (1/2)}{(+0.40376\\,\\mu_{\\mathrm{N}}) / 1} = \\frac{-0.56638}{0.40376} \\approx -1.4027 $$\n    The hyperfine coupling constant for $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, $A_{15}$, is approximately $1.40$ times larger in magnitude than $A_{14}$ and has the opposite sign.\n\n3.  **Line Separation:** The separation between the lines, $\\Delta B$, is proportional to the magnitude of the hyperfine coupling constant.\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta B_{15}}{\\Delta B_{14}} = \\left| \\frac{A_{15}}{A_{14}} \\right| \\approx |-1.4027| \\approx 1.40 $$\n    The new spacing is:\n    $$ \\Delta B_{15} \\approx 1.40 \\times \\Delta B_{14} = 1.40 \\times 1.60\\,\\mathrm{mT} = 2.24\\,\\mathrm{mT} $$\n\n4.  **Line Ordering:** The resonance field is $B_{res}(m_I) = B_0 - a \\cdot m_I$. For $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, $A_{14}$ is positive, so $a_{14}$ is positive. The line for $m_I = +1$ appears at a lower field than the line for $m_I = -1$. For $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$, $A_{15}$ is negative, so $a_{15}$ is negative. The line for $m_I = +1/2$ will appear at a higher field than the line for $m_I = -1/2$. This means the assignment of $m_I$ states to the low-field and high-field lines is reversed.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a triplet with equal spacing $\\Delta B_{14}$; $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a doublet with equal spacing approximately $0.70\\,\\Delta B_{14}$, i.e., about $1.12\\,\\mathrm{mT}$.**\nThe prediction of a triplet for $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ and a doublet for $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ is correct. However, the calculated spacing is incorrect. The ratio is approximately $1.40$, not $0.70$. A ratio of $\\approx 0.70$ would arise from incorrectly taking the simple ratio of the magnetic moments, $|\\mu(^{15}\\mathrm{N})/\\mu(^{14}\\mathrm{N})| \\approx 0.70$, while ignoring the nuclear spins. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a triplet with equal spacing $\\Delta B_{14}$; $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a doublet with equal spacing approximately $1.40\\,\\Delta B_{14}$, i.e., about $2.24\\,\\mathrm{mT}$, with the line ordering in magnetic field reversed because the hyperfine constant changes sign.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the multiplicity of the $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ spectrum (doublet), the magnitude of the new spacing ($\\approx 1.40 \\times \\Delta B_{14} = 2.24\\,\\mathrm{mT}$), and the consequence of the sign change of the hyperfine constant on the line ordering. **Correct**.\n\n**C. $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a doublet because $I=1$ splits the electron transition into two lines; $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ also gives a doublet, and the spacings are identical since the electron spin density is unchanged.**\nThe premise that $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ ($I=1$) gives a doublet is false; it gives a triplet ($2I+1=3$). This contradicts both theory and the problem statement itself. The claim that spacings are identical is also false, as the spacing depends on nuclear properties which differ between the isotopes. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a triplet with unequal spacings already in the isotropic liquid due to its electric quadrupole moment; $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a triplet as well because its hyperfine coupling is stronger.**\nThe problem states that the lines for $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ are equally spaced, which is the expected result in a fast-tumbling liquid where quadrupolar effects are averaged out. The prediction that $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a triplet is false; with $I=1/2$, it must give a doublet. Nuclei with $I=1/2$ do not possess an electric quadrupole moment. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a triplet with equal spacing $\\Delta B_{14}$; $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ gives a doublet with the same spacing $\\Delta B_{14}$ because only the number of nuclear spin projections changes.**\nThe statement wrongly claims the spacing remains the same. The hyperfine spacing is a function of the nuclear magnetic moment and spin, both of which change upon isotopic substitution.

In the high-field approximation, the electron Zeeman term, $\\hat{H}_{EZ} = \\mu_B \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}$, is the dominant term, and the hyperfine term, $\\hat{H}_{HF} = h \\hat{\\mathbf{S}} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{I}}$, is treated as a first-order perturbation.\n\nFor a system with axial symmetry and coincident principal axes for $\\mathbf{g}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$, the energy levels to first order are dependent on the angle $\\theta$ between the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ and the unique principal axis (denoted as the $z$-axis of the molecular frame). The energy for states described by quantum numbers $m_S$ and $m_I$ is:\n$$\nE(m_S, m_I, \\theta) = g(\\theta)\\mu_B B m_S + h A(\\theta) m_S m_I\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field and the orientation-dependent parameters are:\n$$\ng(\\theta) = \\sqrt{g_{\\parallel}^2 \\cos^2\\theta + g_{\\perp}^2 \\sin^2\\theta}\n$$\n$$\nA(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{g(\\theta)\\mu_B} \\sqrt{(g_{\\parallel}\\mu_B A_{\\parallel})^2 \\cos^2\\theta + (g_{\\perp}\\mu_B A_{\\perp})^2 \\sin^2\\theta} \\approx A_{\\parallel} \\cos^2\\theta + A_{\\perp} \\sin^2\\theta\n$$\nThe approximation for $A(\\theta)$ is valid to first order. The EPR transition corresponds to the selection rules $\\Delta m_S = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m_I = 0$. The energy of the absorbed microwave quantum is $h\\nu$, leading to the resonance condition:\n$$\nh\\nu = \\Delta E = E(+1/2, m_I, \\theta) - E(-1/2, m_I, \\theta) = g(\\theta)\\mu_B B + h A(\\theta) m_I\n$$\nThe turning points in an axial powder spectrum correspond to the principal orientations of the molecule relative to the magnetic field.\nFor the parallel orientation ($\\theta=0$), we have $g(0) = g_{\\parallel}$ and $A(0) = A_{\\parallel}$. The resonance field is:\n$$\nB_{\\parallel}(m_I) = \\frac{h\\nu - h m_I A_{\\parallel}}{g_{\\parallel} \\mu_B}\n$$\nFor the perpendicular orientation ($\\theta=\\pi/2$), we have $g(\\pi/2) = g_{\\perp}$ and $A(\\pi/2) = A_{\\perp}$. The resonance field is:\n$$\nB_{\\perp}(m_I) = \\frac{h\\nu - h m_I A_{\\perp}}{g_{\\perp} \\mu_B}\n$$\nThese are the required relations connecting the turning point fields to the principal values of the spin Hamiltonian parameters.\n\nUsing the four provided turning point fields for $m_I = \\pm 1/2$, we have a system of four equations:\n1. $g_{\\parallel} \\mu_B B_{+,\\parallel} = h\\nu - \\frac{1}{2}h A_{\\parallel}$\n2. $g_{\\perp} \\mu_B B_{+,\\perp} = h\\nu - \\frac{1}{2}h A_{\\perp}$\n3. $g_{\\parallel} \\mu_B B_{-,\\parallel} = h\\nu + \\frac{1}{2}h A_{\\parallel}$\n4. $g_{\\perp} \\mu_B B_{-,\\perp} = h\\nu + \\frac{1}{2}h A_{\\perp}$\n\nAdding and subtracting equations (1) and (3) yields expressions for $g_{\\parallel}$ and $A_{\\parallel}$. Similarly, using equations (2) and (4) gives expressions for $g_{\\perp}$ and $A_{\\perp}$. Specifically, for the hyperfine couplings:\n$$\nh A_{\\parallel} = g_{\\parallel} \\mu_B (B_{-,\\parallel} - B_{+,\\parallel})\n$$\n$$\n2h\\nu = g_{\\parallel} \\mu_B (B_{-,\\parallel} + B_{+,\\parallel})\n$$\nDividing these two equations eliminates $g_{\\parallel}$ and the fundamental constants:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\parallel}}{2\\nu} = \\frac{B_{-,\\parallel} - B_{+,\\parallel}}{B_{-,\\parallel} + B_{+,\\parallel}} \\implies A_{\\parallel} = 2\\nu \\frac{B_{-,\\parallel} - B_{+,\\parallel}}{B_{-,\\parallel} + B_{+,\\parallel}}\n$$\nBy an identical argument:\n$$\nA_{\\perp} = 2\\nu \\frac{B_{-,\\perp} - B_{+,\\perp}}{B_{-,\\perp} + B_{+,\\perp}}\n$$\nThe isotropic hyperfine coupling is defined as $A_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(A_{\\parallel} + 2 A_{\\perp}\\right)$. Substituting the expressions for $A_{\\parallel}$ and $A_{\\perp}$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{2\\nu}{3} \\left( \\frac{B_{-,\\parallel} - B_{+,\\parallel}}{B_{-,\\parallel} + B_{+,\\parallel}} + 2 \\frac{B_{-,\\perp} - B_{+,\\perp}}{B_{-,\\perp} + B_{+,\\perp}} \\right)\n$$\nNow we must perform the uncertainty analysis. The uncertainty in the measured fields has two components: a common multiplicative calibration error ($u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$) and an independent additive noise error ($u_{\\mathrm{noise}}$).\nLet us analyze the effect of the multiplicative calibration error. If all field values $B_i$ are scaled by a common factor $C$, i.e., $B_i \\rightarrow C \\cdot B_i$, the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ becomes:\n$$\nA'_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{2\\nu}{3} \\left( \\frac{C B_{-,\\parallel} - C B_{+,\\parallel}}{C B_{-,\\parallel} + C B_{+,\\parallel}} + 2 \\frac{C B_{-,\\perp} - C B_{+,\\perp}}{C B_{-,\\perp} + C B_{+,\\perp}} \\right) = \\frac{2\\nu}{3} \\left( \\frac{B_{-,\\parallel} - B_{+,\\parallel}}{B_{-,\\parallel} + B_{+,\\parallel}} + 2 \\frac{B_{-,\\perp} - B_{+,\\perp}}{B_{-,\\perp} + B_{+,\\perp}} \\right) = A_{\\mathrm{iso}}\n$$\nThe value of $A_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ is invariant under a common scaling of all magnetic field values. Consequently, the calibration uncertainty $u_{\\mathrm{cal}}$ does not contribute to the uncertainty of $A_{\\mathrm{iso}}$.\n\nThe only remaining source of uncertainty is the independent noise-limited picking uncertainty, $u_{\\mathrm{noise}} = 0.020$ mT, for each of the four field measurements. We denote the four field measurements as $B_1 = B_{+,\\parallel}$, $B_2 = B_{+,\\perp}$, $B_3 = B_{-,\\parallel}$, and $B_4 = B_{-,\\perp}$. Since these uncertainties are independent, the squared standard uncertainty of $A_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ is given by the sum of the squared partial derivatives with respect to each field, weighted by the squared uncertainty of that field:\n$$\nu(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left( \\frac{\\partial A_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{\\partial B_i} \\right)^2 u(B_i)^2 = u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left( \\frac{\\partial A_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{\\partial B_i} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe expression for $A_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ is separable into parallel and perpendicular components, $A_{\\mathrm{iso}} = \\frac{1}{3}(A_{\\parallel} + 2 A_{\\perp})$, where $A_{\\parallel}$ depends only on $B_1$ and $B_3$, and $A_{\\perp}$ depends only on $B_2$ and $B_4$. Due to independence, their uncertainties add in quadrature:\n$$\nu(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\left( u(A_{\\parallel})^2 + 4 u(A_{\\perp})^2 \\right)\n$$\nLet us now compute $u(A_{\\parallel})^2$ and $u(A_{\\perp})^2$. For convenient calculation, we express $A$ in MHz, $\\nu$ in GHz, and $B$ in mT.\n$$\nA_{\\parallel} [\\text{MHz}] = 2 \\nu[\\text{GHz}] \\times 1000 \\frac{B_3 - B_1}{B_3 + B_1}\n$$\nLet $K = 2 \\nu[\\text{GHz}] \\times 1000 = 2 \\times 9.500 \\times 1000 = 19000$ MHz.\nThe partial derivatives of $A_{\\parallel}$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{\\parallel}}{\\partial B_1} = K \\frac{-(B_3+B_1) - (B_3-B_1)}{(B_3+B_1)^2} = \\frac{-2 K B_3}{(B_3+B_1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{\\parallel}}{\\partial B_3} = K \\frac{(B_3+B_1) - (B_3-B_1)}{(B_3+B_1)^2} = \\frac{2 K B_1}{(B_3+B_1)^2}\n$$\nThe variance of $A_{\\parallel}$ is:\n$$\nu(A_{\\parallel})^2 = \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_{\\parallel}}{\\partial B_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial A_{\\parallel}}{\\partial B_3}\\right)^2 \\right) u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2 = \\left( \\frac{4K^2 B_3^2}{(B_3+B_1)^4} + \\frac{4K^2 B_1^2}{(B_3+B_1)^4} \\right) u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2 = \\frac{4 K^2 (B_1^2 + B_3^2)}{(B_1+B_3)^4} u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2\n$$\nBy analogy, the variance of $A_{\\perp}$ is:\n$$\nu(A_{\\perp})^2 = \\frac{4 K^2 (B_2^2 + B_4^2)}{(B_2+B_4)^4} u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2\n$$\nCombining these results, the variance of $A_{\\mathrm{iso}}$ is:\n$$\nu(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\left[ \\frac{4 K^2 (B_1^2 + B_3^2)}{(B_1+B_3)^4} u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2 + 4 \\frac{4 K^2 (B_2^2 + B_4^2)}{(B_2+B_4)^4} u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nu(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\frac{4 K^2 u_{\\mathrm{noise}}^2}{9} \\left[ \\frac{B_1^2 + B_3^2}{(B_1+B_3)^4} + 4 \\frac{B_2^2 + B_4^2}{(B_2+B_4)^4} \\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$K = 19000$ MHz\n$u_{\\mathrm{noise}} = 0.020$ mT\n$B_1 = B_{+,\\parallel} = 338.122$ mT\n$B_2 = B_{+,\\perp} = 338.869$ mT\n$B_3 = B_{-,\\parallel} = 338.880$ mT\n$B_4 = B_{-,\\perp} = 339.317$ mT\n\nFirst term in brackets:\n$B_1+B_3 = 677.002$ mT\n$B_1^2+B_3^2 = (338.122)^2 + (338.880)^2 = 114326.6 + 114839.6 = 229166.2$ mT$^2$\nTerm 1 = $\\frac{229166.2}{(677.002)^4} \\approx 1.0910 \\times 10^{-6}$ mT$^{-2}$\n\nSecond term in brackets:\n$B_2+B_4 = 678.186$ mT\n$B_2^2+B_4^2 = (338.869)^2 + (339.317)^2 = 114832.3 + 115136.0 = 229968.3$ mT$^2$\nTerm 2 = $4 \\times \\frac{229968.3}{(678.186)^4} \\approx 4 \\times (1.0870 \\times 10^{-6}) = 4.3480 \\times 10^{-6}$ mT$^{-2}$\n\nSum of terms in bracket = $(1.0910 + 4.3480) \\times 10^{-6} = 5.4390 \\times 10^{-6}$ mT$^{-2}$\n\n$u(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\frac{4 \\times (19000)^2 \\times (0.020)^2}{9} \\times (5.4390 \\times 10^{-6})$ MHz$^2$\n$u(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\frac{4 \\times (3.61 \\times 10^8) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{9} \\times (5.4390 \\times 10^{-6})$ MHz$^2$\n$u(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = \\frac{5.776 \\times 10^5}{9} \\times (5.4390 \\times 10^{-6})$ MHz$^2$\n$u(A_{\\mathrm{iso}})^2 = (64177.8) \\times (5.4390 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 0.3490$ MHz$^2$\n\nThe standard uncertainty is the square root:\n$u(A_{\\mathrm{iso}}) = \\sqrt{0.3490} \\approx 0.59076$ MHz.\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the combined standard uncertainty is $0.591$ MHz.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.591}\n$$", "id": "2636423"}]}
