It is a standard problem in chemical kinetics that tests the fundamental principles of Transition State Theory (TST). We thus proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the temperature dependence of the TST rate constant, $k$, in terms of activation state functions ($\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}, \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$). We begin from first principles as stipulated.\n\nConsider a unimolecular isomerization reaction:\n$$ R \\rightarrow P $$\nThis reaction proceeds through an activated complex at the transition state (TS), denoted by $\\ddagger$. TST posits a quasi-equilibrium between the reactant, $R$, and the activated complex, $TS^{\\ddagger}$.\n$$ R \\rightleftharpoons TS^{\\ddagger} $$\nThe rate of reaction, $v$, is defined as the flux of species passing through the transition state dividing surface towards the products. This is given by the concentration of activated complexes, $[TS^{\\ddagger}]$, multiplied by the frequency, $\\nu$, with which they cross the barrier to form products. A transmission coefficient, $\\kappa$, accounts for complexes that recross the barrier back to reactants.\n$$ v = \\kappa \\nu [TS^{\\ddagger}] $$\nThe rate is also given by the macroscopic rate law, $v = k[R]$, where $k$ is the rate constant. Equating the two expressions for the rate and solving for $k$ gives:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\kappa \\nu [TS^{\\ddagger}]}{[R]} $$\nThe ratio of concentrations is determined by the equilibrium constant for the formation of the activated complex, $K^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{[TS^{\\ddagger}]}{[R]}$.\n$$ k = \\kappa \\nu K^{\\ddagger} $$\nThe core of TST is the treatment of the motion along the reaction coordinate at the transition state. This motion is considered a loose vibration of frequency $\\nu^{\\ddagger}$, which is the frequency $\\nu$ in the expression above. We can express the equilibrium constant $K^{\\ddagger}$ using statistical mechanics in terms of molecular partition functions, $q$.\n$$ K^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{q_{TS^{\\ddagger}}}{q_R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nHere, $q_{TS^{\\ddagger}}$ and $q_R$ are the total partition functions for the transition state and reactant, respectively, $\\Delta E_0^{\\ddagger}$ is the difference in zero-point energies between the TS and the reactant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe partition function of the transition state, $q_{TS^{\\ddagger}}$, includes all degrees of freedom. We can factor out the contribution from the vibrational mode along the reaction coordinate, $q_{\\nu^{\\ddagger}}$:\n$$ q_{TS^{\\ddagger}} = q_{\\nu^{\\ddagger}} q_{\\ddagger} $$\nwhere $q_{\\ddagger}$ is the partition function of the activated complex with the reaction coordinate motion removed. The partition function for a harmonic oscillator of frequency $\\nu^{\\ddagger}$ is $q_{\\nu^{\\ddagger}} = (1 - \\exp(-h\\nu^{\\ddagger}/k_B T))^{-1}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant.\n\nFor the very low frequency of the unstable mode corresponding to the reaction coordinate, $h\\nu^{\\ddagger} \\ll k_B T$, we can use the high-temperature approximation: $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$.\n$$ q_{\\nu^{\\ddagger}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - (1 - h\\nu^{\\ddagger}/k_B T)} = \\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu^{\\ddagger}} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $K^{\\ddagger}$ gives:\n$$ K^{\\ddagger} = \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu^{\\ddagger}}\\right) \\frac{q_{\\ddagger}}{q_R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nNow we insert this into the expression for the rate constant $k$, with $\\nu = \\nu^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$ k = \\kappa \\nu^{\\ddagger} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{h\\nu^{\\ddagger}}\\right) \\frac{q_{\\ddagger}}{q_R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe arbitrary frequency $\\nu^{\\ddagger}$ conveniently cancels, yielding the fundamental equation of TST, also known as the Eyring equation:\n$$ k = \\kappa \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{q_{\\ddagger}}{q_R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThis expression can be related to thermodynamic state functions of activation.

We may proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe foundation of our analysis is the Eyring equation from Transition State Theory (TST):\n$$ k = \\frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/(RT)} $$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $R$ is the gas constant, and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ is the Gibbs free energy of activation.\n\nRearranging for the Eyring plot coordinates, $\\ln(k/T)$ versus $1/T$:\n$$ \\frac{k}{T} = \\frac{k_B}{h} e^{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R} e^{-\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}/(RT)} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{T}\\right) = \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R} \\right] - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThis equation predicts a linear plot of $\\ln(k/T)$ versus $1/T$ with a slope of $-\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}/R$ and an intercept related to $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$, provided that $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ are independent of temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the plot for the H-atom transfer exhibits upward (concave up) curvature at low temperatures. Curvature implies that the slope is not constant, which means that $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ is a function of temperature. The relationship is given by the heat capacity of activation, $\\Delta C_p^{\\ddagger} = d(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger})/dT$. The curvature of the plot is given by the second derivative of $y = \\ln(k/T)$ with respect to $x = 1/T$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2}{d(1/T)^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{T}\\right) = \\frac{T^2 \\Delta C_p^{\\ddagger}}{R} $$\nConcave up curvature means the second derivative is positive. Since $T^2$ and $R$ are positive, this implies $\\Delta C_p^{\\ddagger} \\gt 0$.\n\nHowever, an alternative and often dominant source of curvature in light-atom transfer reactions is quantum-mechanical tunneling. TST assumes particles must have enough energy to pass over the potential energy barrier. Quantum mechanics allows particles to \"tunnel\" through the barrier even with insufficient energy. This effect is incorporated into TST by introducing a temperature-dependent transmission coefficient, $\\kappa(T)$, which is the ratio of the true rate constant to the TST rate constant.\n$$ k_{\\text{obs}} = \\kappa(T) k_{\\text{TST}} $$\nFor tunneling, $\\kappa(T) \\gt 1$. The probability of tunneling, and thus the value of $\\kappa(T)$, increases as temperature decreases and is strongly dependent on the mass of the tunneling particle (lighter particles tunnel more readily).\n\nIncluding the tunneling correction, the Eyring equation becomes:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{obs}}}{T}\\right) = \\ln(\\kappa(T)) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{TST}}}{T}\\right) = \\ln(\\kappa(T)) + \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R} \\right] - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\ln(\\kappa(T))$ is added to the conventional linear expression. Since $\\kappa(T)$ increases as $T$ decreases (i.e., as $1/T$ increases), $\\ln(\\kappa(T))$ is an increasing, non-linear function of $1/T$. Adding this function to the linear TST term produces a curve with a continuously steepening slope as $1/T$ increases, which corresponds to upward (concave up) curvature. This matches the experimental observation.\n\nThe kinetic isotope effect (KIE), $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$, is a powerful diagnostic tool. With tunneling, the KIE is:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}(T) k_{\\text{TST, H}}}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T) k_{\\text{TST, D}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}(T)}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}}\\right)_{\\text{TST}} $$\nSince tunneling probability is highly sensitive to mass, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}(T)$ will be significantly larger than $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T)$, especially at low temperatures. As $T$ decreases, both $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}$ increase, but $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}$ increases much more sharply. Consequently, the ratio $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}(T)/\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T)$ increases as temperature decreases, causing the overall KIE to rise significantly at low temperatures. The observation that $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$ increases from $\\sim 3$ to $\\sim 9$ as temperature drops is a classic signature of tunneling.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For a light-atom transfer across a narrow barrier, quantum-mechanical tunneling introduces a multiplicative transmission coefficient $\\kappa(T) \\gt 1$ that increases as $T$ decreases, thereby adding a positive, temperature-dependent contribution to $\\ln(k/T)$ that grows with $1/T$ and produces upward curvature at low $T$.**\nThis statement is a precise and correct description of the effect of quantum tunneling on the Eyring plot. The introduction of $\\kappa(T) \\gt 1$, which increases as $T$ decreases, adds the term $\\ln(\\kappa(T))$ to the Eyring equation. As $1/T$ increases, $\\ln(\\kappa(T))$ increases, causing the slope to become more negative (steeper) and resulting in concave up curvature. The conditions mentioned (light-atom transfer, narrow barrier) are precisely those under which tunneling is significant.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. A negative heat capacity of activation $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger} \\lt 0$ always causes the same upward curvature as tunneling in $\\ln(k/T)$ versus $1/T$ plots and cannot be distinguished by isotopic substitution; therefore, curvature alone proves tunneling.**\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods. First, as derived above, upward (concave up) curvature corresponds to $\\Delta C_p^{\\ddagger} \\gt 0$. A negative $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}$ would cause downward curvature. Second, the effect of $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}$ can be distinguished from tunneling by isotopic substitution. While $\\Delta C_{p}^{\\ddagger}$ depends on isotope (through vibrational frequencies), the effect is typically modest. In contrast, tunneling shows an exponential dependence on mass, leading to a dramatic difference between H and D isotopes, as observed in the problem (curvature is large for H, negligible for D). Third, the conclusion that \"curvature alone proves tunneling\" is an oversimplification and epistemologically unsound in science; alternative hypotheses must always be ruled out.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If tunneling is responsible, replacing $\\mathrm{H}$ by $\\mathrm{D}$ should reduce tunneling probability, diminishing the low-$T$ curvature and leading to a primary kinetic isotope effect $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$ that increases as $T$ decreases.**\nThis statement describes the key experimental diagnostics for tunneling. Replacing hydrogen with the heavier deuterium isotope drastically reduces the tunneling probability. This diminishes the magnitude of $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T)$ and its temperature dependence, thus making the Eyring plot for the D-reaction far more linear, which is consistent with the problem statement. Furthermore, because $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{H}}(T)$ is much more sensitive to temperature than $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{D}}(T)$, the ratio $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$ becomes strongly temperature-dependent, increasing as temperature falls. This also matches the observations. This statement correctly outlines the expected consequences of isotopic substitution if tunneling is the cause.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In gas-phase kinetics, temperature-dependent viscosity is the primary origin of curvature; as a diagnostic for tunneling, one should instead plot $\\ln k$ versus $1/T$, which should be more linear than $\\ln(k/T)$ versus $1/T$ if tunneling is present.**\nThe premise of this statement is faulty. Viscosity is a medium transport property and is relevant for diffusion-controlled reactions in liquids or very high-pressure gases. The problem explicitly states the reaction is studied under \"low-pressure, collisionless conditions where transport properties are not rate limiting.\" Therefore, viscosity is not a relevant factor. The second part of the statement claims an Arrhenius plot ($\\ln k$ vs $1/T$) should be more linear than an Eyring plot ($\\ln(k/T)$ vs $1/T$) if tunneling is present. This is not generally true. Tunneling introduces non-linearity into both types of plots. There is no fundamental reason why one plot would be inherently more linear than the other in the presence of tunneling. The Eyring formulation is more physically rigorous as it explicitly accounts for the linear temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor from the flux across the transition state.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. A quantitative test for tunneling is to fit the data to a semiclassical tunneling correction model to obtain a transmission coefficient $\\kappa(T)$; if division by the fitted $\\kappa(T)$ collapses $\\ln(k/[\\kappa(T) T])$ versus $1/T$ onto a single straight line with a constant slope over the entire range, this is consistent with tunneling as the origin of the curvature.**\nThis describes a standard, powerful method for quantitatively analyzing kinetic data for tunneling. The procedure is to correct the observed rate constant $k_{\\text{obs}}$ by dividing out a theoretically calculated transmission coefficient, $k_{\\text{corr}} = k_{\\text{obs}}/\\kappa(T)$. If the curvature in the original Eyring plot was solely due to tunneling, and the model for $\\kappa(T)$ (e.g., Wigner, Eckart, or Bell correction) is accurate, then the corrected Eyring plot of $\\ln(k_{\\text{corr}}/T)$ vs $1/T$ should become linear. Achieving such a linearization provides strong quantitative support for the tunneling hypothesis. This statement correctly describes a valid and commonly used diagnostic procedure.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2962498"}]}
