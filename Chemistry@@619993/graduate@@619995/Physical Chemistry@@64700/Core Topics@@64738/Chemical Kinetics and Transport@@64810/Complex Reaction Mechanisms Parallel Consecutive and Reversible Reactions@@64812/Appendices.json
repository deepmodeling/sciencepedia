However, these elementary bottleneck rates, $k_{BC}^{+}$ and $k_{BC}^{-}$, are weighted by factors representing the availability of reactants at the \"gates\" of the bottleneck. The effective forward rate constant $k_{XY}$ is the elementary rate $k_{BC}^{+}$ multiplied by the probability $p_{\\mathrm{B}|X}$ of finding a molecule from the reactant pool $X$ in the reactive state $\\mathrm{B}$. Similarly, the effective reverse rate constant $k_{YX}$ is the elementary rate $k_{BC}^{-}$ multiplied by the probability $p_{\\mathrm{C}|Y}$ of finding a molecule from the product pool $Y$ in the reactive state $\\mathrm{C}$. The slow mode's dependence on the bottleneck step is therefore direct via $k_{BC}^{\\pm}$ and indirect via the fast equilibria on either side, which modulate the flux through the bottleneck.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the slowest relaxation time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{slow}} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{slow}}$, using the given numerical values:\n$$ k_{AB}^{+}=50\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1},\\quad k_{AB}^{-}=100\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{BC}^{+}=0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1},\\quad k_{BC}^{-}=0.1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{CD}^{+}=120\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1},\\quad k_{CD}^{-}=60\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nFirst, we calculate the equilibrium fractions:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{B}|X} = \\frac{k_{AB}^{+}}{k_{AB}^{+}+k_{AB}^{-}} = \\frac{50}{50+100} = \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{C}|Y} = \\frac{k_{CD}^{-}}{k_{CD}^{-}+k_{CD}^{+}} = \\frac{60}{60+120} = \\frac{60}{180} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nNow, we calculate the slow rate $k_{\\mathrm{slow}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{slow}} = (0.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + (0.1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{0.2+0.1}{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{0.3}{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe slowest relaxation time constant is the reciprocal of this rate:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{slow}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{slow}}} = \\frac{1}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the result is $10.00$ seconds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.00}$$", "id": "2631746"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most critical skill for a kineticist is not just solving equations, but determining which equations correctly describe reality.

This signifies that the concentration of $C$ increases fastest at $t=0$ and the rate of production subsequently decelerates as $A$ is consumed.\n\nHypothesis (ii): Consecutive unimolecular sequence\nThe mechanism is $A \\xrightarrow{k_a} B \\xrightarrow{k_b} C$.\nThe elementary step for the formation of $C$ is $B \\xrightarrow{k_b} C$, so the rate law for $C$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_b [B] $$\nThe initial rate of formation of $C$ at $t=0$ depends on the initial concentration of the intermediate $B$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_b [B](0) $$\nGiven the initial condition $[B](0) = 0$, the initial rate is:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = 0 $$\nThis zero initial rate is characteristic of a reaction mechanism where the monitored product is formed from an intermediate that is not present at the beginning of the reaction. This leads to an \"induction period\" or \"lag phase\" in the appearance of $C$.\n\nThe initial curvature is found by evaluating the second derivative at $t=0$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2[C]}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt} (k_b [B](t)) = k_b \\frac{d[B]}{dt} $$\nFrom the mechanism, the rate law for the intermediate $B$ is $\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_a [A] - k_b [B]$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the second derivative of $[C]$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d^2[C]}{dt^2} = k_b (k_a [A] - k_b [B]) $$\nEvaluating at $t=0$ with the initial conditions $[A](0) = [A]_0$ and $[B](0) = 0$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{d^2[C]}{dt^2}\\right|_{t=0} = k_b (k_a [A](0) - k_b [B](0)) = k_b (k_a [A]_0 - 0) = k_a k_b [A]_0 $$\nSince the rate constants $k_a, k_b$ and the initial concentration $[A]_0$ are all positive, the initial curvature is positive. This means that the curve for $[C](t)$ starts with a zero slope and is concave up, indicating an initial acceleration in the rate of product formation.\n\nWith this rigorous foundation, we evaluate each proposed option.\n\nA. The proposal is to measure the initial rate $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}$. Our analysis shows that for the direct path, $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_1 [A]_0 > 0$, while for the consecutive path, $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = 0$. This provides a clear, unambiguous distinction. A non-zero initial rate (within experimental error) would support the direct mechanism, while a zero initial rate (an observed lag) would support the consecutive mechanism. The reasoning presented in the option is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The proposal is to seed the reaction with a small amount of the intermediate, $[B](0) = \\varepsilon$.\nFor the direct path $A \\to C$, the rate law $\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt} = k_1 [A]$ is independent of $[B]$. Therefore, adding a seed of $B$ would have no effect on the time course of $[C]$, and the initial rate would remain $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_1 [A]_0$.\nFor the consecutive path $A \\to B \\to C$, the initial rate is $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_b [B](0)$. With the seed, this becomes $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_b \\varepsilon$. This is a positive initial rate, proportional to the seed concentration $\\varepsilon$. The induction period is thus eliminated.\nObserving whether a seed of $B$ abolishes the lag phase and introduces an initial rate is a definitive test to identify the role of $B$ as an intermediate. The description in the option is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. The proposal is to examine the dependence of the initial rate on $[A]_0$.\nFor the direct path, $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = k_1 [A]_0$. This is a linear dependence on $[A]_0$. The option states this correctly.\nFor the consecutive path, $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = 0$. The initial rate is zero, regardless of the value of $[A]_0$. The option wrongly claims a quadratic dependence, $\\left.\\dfrac{d[C]}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} \\propto [A]_0^2$. This is fundamentally incorrect for the given first-order mechanism. The initial rate is not quadratic in $[A]_0$; it is zero. An experimentalist might be tempted to measure an \"initial rate\" over a small but finite time interval $\\Delta t$, where $[C](\\Delta t) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} k_a k_b [A]_0 (\\Delta t)^2$. The average rate $\\frac{[C](\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}$ would then be proportional to $[A]_0$, not $[A]_0^2$. The premise of this diagnostic is flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The proposal is to use the sign of the initial curvature, $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2[C]}{dt^2}\\right|_{t=0}$, as the diagnostic tool.\nOur analysis showed that for the direct path, $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2[C]}{dt^2}\\right|_{t=0} = -k_1^2 [A]_0$, which is negative. This corresponds to a curve starting with a positive slope that decelerates (concave down), as correctly described.\nFor the consecutive path, $\\left.\\dfrac{d^2[C]}{dt^2}\\right|_{t=0} = k_a k_b [A]_0$, which is positive. This corresponds to a curve starting with a zero slope that accelerates (concave up), also correctly described.\nThe sign of the initial curvature is a direct and unambiguous consequence of the underlying mechanism and serves as an excellent diagnostic, complementary to the initial rate analysis in option A.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. The proposal is to vary the solvent viscosity and look for changes in the kinetics. This method introduces physical phenomena that are not part of the core kinetic model as specified. The rate constants of true unimolecular reactions are typically considered independent of solvent viscosity. While there are theories (like Kramers' theory) where viscosity can affect intramolecular processes, there is no information in the problem statement to suggest that one mechanism would be viscosity-dependent while the other would not. To \"attribute any change... to the presence of diffusion control\" would be an unsubstantiated assumption, not a logical deduction. This experiment cannot provide an unambiguous discrimination based on the given information because it relies on external, undefined assumptions about the physical nature of the reaction steps.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2631722"}]}
