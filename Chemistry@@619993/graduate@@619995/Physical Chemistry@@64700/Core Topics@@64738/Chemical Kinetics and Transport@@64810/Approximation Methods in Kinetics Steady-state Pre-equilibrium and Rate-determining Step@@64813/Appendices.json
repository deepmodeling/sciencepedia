It is a canonical problem in chemical kinetics that requires the application of fundamental principles. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires three distinct components: the derivation of the rate equations, the specification of initial conditions, and the analysis of approximation regimes.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Mass-Action Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nThe reaction mechanism consists of three elementary steps:\n1. $A \\xrightarrow{k_1} I$\n2. $I \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} A$\n3. $I \\xrightarrow{k_2} P$\n\nApplying the law of mass action to each species:\n\n- **Species A**: It is consumed in the first step with rate $k_1[A]$ and produced in the second step with rate $k_{-1}[I]$. The net rate of change of the concentration of $A$, $[A]$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[A]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[A] + k_{-1}[I]\n$$\n\n- **Species I**: It is an intermediate. It is produced in the first step with rate $k_1[A]$ and consumed in the second and third steps with rates $k_{-1}[I]$ and $k_2[I]$, respectively. The net rate of change of the concentration of $I$, $[I]$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[A] - k_{-1}[I] - k_2[I] = k_1[A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]\n$$\n\n- **Species P**: It is the final product, formed only in the third step with rate $k_2[I]$. The net rate of change of the concentration of $P$, $[P]$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[I]\n$$\n\nThus, the correct system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[A]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[A] + k_{-1}[I]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[I]\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Initial Conditions**\n\nThe problem specifies that the reactor is \"charged at $t=0$ with $A$ only\". This implies that at the beginning of the reaction ($t=0$), the only species present is the reactant $A$. Let its initial concentration be $[A]_0$. This concentration must be positive for any reaction to occur, so $[A]_0 > 0$. The initial concentrations of the intermediate $I$ and the product $P$ must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal and self-consistent set of initial conditions is:\n$$\n[A](0) = [A]_0 > 0, \\quad [I](0) = 0, \\quad [P](0) = 0\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Approximation Regimes and Overall Rate Laws**\n\nThe overall rate of product formation is $v(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[I]$. To express this in terms of the reactant concentration $[A]$, we must find an approximate expression for $[I]$.\n\n**a) The Steady-State Approximation (SSA) for the intermediate $I$**\n\nThe SSA is applicable when the intermediate $I$ is highly reactive and its concentration remains low and nearly constant throughout most of the reaction, i.e., $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx 0$. This approximation is valid when the rate of consumption of the intermediate is much greater than its rate of formation, which for this system corresponds to the condition $k_{-1} + k_2 \\gg k_1$.\n\nSetting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$:\n$$\nk_1[A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]_{ss} \\approx 0\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration of $I$, denoted $[I]_{ss}$:\n$$\n[I]_{ss} \\approx \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2}[A]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the rate law for $P$:\n$$\nv(t) = k_2[I]_{ss} \\approx k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\right) [A](t) = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}[A](t)\n$$\n\n**b) The Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA) for the step $A \\rightleftharpoons I$**\n\nThe PEA is applicable when the first reversible step is very fast compared to the subsequent product formation step. This means the rates of the forward and reverse reactions of the first step are much larger than the rate of the second step, establishing a rapid equilibrium. The condition for this is $k_1 \\gg k_2$ and $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$.\n\nUnder this condition, the first step is assumed to be at equilibrium:\n$$\nk_1[A] \\approx k_{-1}[I]\n$$\nSolving for the pre-equilibrium concentration of $I$, denoted $[I]_{pe}$:\n$$\n[I]_{pe} \\approx \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[A]\n$$\nThe overall rate is determined by the slow, rate-determining step, $I \\xrightarrow{k_2} P$:\n$$\nv(t) = k_2[I]_{pe} \\approx k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} \\right) [A](t) = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[A](t)\n$$\nNote that the PEA is a limiting case of the SSA. If $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$, the SSA expression $v(t) \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}[A](t)$ simplifies to $v(t) \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[A](t)$, which is the PEA result.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - ODEs: The set of ODEs provided, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[A]}{\\mathrm{d}t}=-k_1[A]+k_{-1}[I]$, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t}=k_1[A]-(k_{-1}+k_2)[I]$, and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t}=k_2[I]$, is identical to our derivation. **Correct**.\n  - Initial conditions: The set $[A](0)=[A]_0>0, \\;[I](0)=0, \\;[P](0)=0$ matches our derivation. **Correct**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates:\n    - The PEA is correctly identified for the regime $k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$, with the correct rate law $v(t)\\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[A](t)$. **Correct**.\n    - The SSA is correctly identified for the regime $k_{-1}+k_2 \\gg k_1$, with the correct rate law $v(t)\\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}+k_2}[A](t)$. **Correct**.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **Option B**:\n  - ODEs: The rate equation for $[A]$ is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[A]}{\\mathrm{d}t}=-k_1[A]-k_{-1}[I]$, which is incorrect as the term for the reverse reaction must be positive ($+k_{-1}[I]$). The equation for $[I]$ is also incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n  - Initial conditions: The condition $[P](0)=[A]_0$ contradicts the problem statement that the reactor is charged with $A$ only. **Incorrect**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates: The conditions and rate laws presented for both PEA and SSA are fundamentally flawed, confusing the conditions and resulting expressions. For example, the condition for PEA is given as $k_2\\gg k_{-1}$ and $k_2\\gg k_1$, which describes a scenario where the first step is rate-limiting, not a pre-equilibrium. **Incorrect**.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **Option C**:\n  - ODEs: The set of ODEs is correct. **Correct**.\n  - Initial conditions: The condition $[I](0)=[A]_0$ contradicts the problem statement that the reactor is charged with $A$ only. **Incorrect**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates: The labels for the PEA and SSA regimes are swapped. The condition $k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$ corresponds to PEA, not SSA. The condition $k_{-1}+k_2 \\gg k_1$ corresponds to SSA, not PEA. **Incorrect**.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **Option D**:\n  - ODEs: The rate equation for $[I]$ contains a sign error ($+k_2[I]$ instead of $-k_2[I]$). The rate equation for $[P]$ is also incorrect ($-k_2[I]$ instead of $+k_2[I]$). **Incorrect**.\n  - Initial conditions: The set of initial conditions is correct. **Correct**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates: The analysis is flawed. For pre-equilibrium, the condition is incomplete ($k_{-1}\\gg k_2$ alone is not sufficient), and the rate law is incorrect (missing a factor of $k_1$). For the steady-state, the condition given is a special case, not the general one, and the rate law is also missing the factor $k_1$. **Incorrect**.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of all components, only option A is correct in its entirety.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2624187"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational concepts, this exercise explores the subtle relationship between the pre-equilibrium approximation (PEA) and the steady-state approximation (SSA).

It requires rigorous derivation and comparison, which is a non-trivial exercise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution shall be provided.\n\nWe now proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\n1. Derivation of the Differential Equations\nBased on the law of mass action for the given reaction mechanism, we can write the system of ordinary differential equations that govern the time evolution of the concentrations of species $A$, $I$, and $P$.\nThe concentration of species $A$ decreases due to the forward reaction with rate constant $k_1$ and increases due to the reverse reaction with rate constant $k_{-1}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[A]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_{1}[A] + k_{-1}[I]\n$$\nThe concentration of the intermediate $I$ increases from the forward reaction of $A$, decreases by reverting to $A$, and decreases by forming the product $P$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{1}[A] - k_{-1}[I] - k_{2}[I] = k_{1}[A] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I]\n$$\nThe concentration of the product $P$ increases from the irreversible reaction of the intermediate $I$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{2}[I]\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n2. Rate-Determining Step (RDS) and Pre-Equilibrium Approximation\nThe assumption that the second step is rate-determining implies it is significantly slower than the first, reversible step. This means the rate constants for the first step are much larger than the rate constant for the second step: $k_{1}, k_{-1} \\gg k_{2}$. Under this condition, the first step, $A \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} I$, can be considered to be in a state of quasi-equilibrium. This means the forward and reverse rates of this step are nearly equal, and much larger than the rate of consumption of $I$ to form $P$.\nThe quasi-equilibrium condition is expressed as:\n$$\nk_{1}[A] \\approx k_{-1}[I]\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of the intermediate $[I]$ in terms of the reactant concentration $[A]$:\n$$\n[I]_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\approx \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A]\n$$\nThe rate of formation of the product $P$, designated as $v_{\\mathrm{RDS}}$, is governed by the slow step:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{RDS}} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{2}[I]\n$$\nSubstituting the quasi-equilibrium expression for $[I]$ gives the rate law under the pre-equilibrium approximation:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{RDS}} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A] \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A]\n$$\n\n3. Steady-State Approximation (SSA)\nThe steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of the reactive intermediate $I$ is low and its rate of change is negligible compared to the rates of change of the reactant $A$ and product $P$. Mathematically, this is stated as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx 0\n$$\nUsing the differential equation for $[I]$ derived in part 1:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[I]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{1}[A] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I] = 0\n$$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $[I]_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\n(k_{-1} + k_{2})[I]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{1}[A] \\implies [I]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A]\n$$\nThe rate of product formation, designated as $v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$, is again given by $\\mathrm{d}[P]/\\mathrm{d}t = k_{2}[I]$. Substituting the steady-state expression for $[I]$ yields the SSA rate law:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = k_{2} [I]_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A] \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A]\n$$\nThe steady-state approximation is generally more robust than the pre-equilibrium approximation. The condition for pre-equilibrium, $k_{-1} \\gg k_{2}$, is a special case of the condition under which SSA simplifies to the pre-equilibrium form.\n\n4. Fractional Error Calculation\nThe fractional error $\\varepsilon$ of the RDS rate relative to the SSA rate is defined as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\equiv \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{RDS}} - v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}}{v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}}\n$$\nWe substitute the derived expressions for $v_{\\mathrm{RDS}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$. We note that the problem specifies $[A](t)$ is finite and positive, so we can divide by it.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A] - \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A]}{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A]}\n$$\nThe common factor of $k_{1}k_{2}[A]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_{-1}} - \\frac{1}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}{\\frac{1}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(k_{-1} + k_{2})$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{-1}} - \\frac{1}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right) (k_{-1} + k_{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{2}}{k_{-1}} - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1}}\\right) - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1}}\n$$\nThis final, simple expression reveals that the fractional error is precisely the ratio of the rate constant of the second step to the rate constant of the reverse first step. The pre-equilibrium approximation becomes exact in the limit $k_2/k_{-1} \\to 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $k_{-1} = 47\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{2} = 12\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{12}{47}\n$$\nPerforming the division and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\approx 0.2553191...\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\approx 0.2553\n$$\nThe value of $k_1$ is irrelevant for this final calculation, as it cancels out during the derivation of the fractional error. The error of approximately $25.5\\%$ is substantial, which is consistent with the condition that the reverse step $k_{-1}$ is only moderately, not overwhelmingly, faster than the product formation step $k_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2553}$$", "id": "2624172"}, {"introduction": "One of the most common conceptual hurdles in chemical kinetics is the misinterpretation of the Rate-Determining Step (RDS).

Under this condition, the rate of the forward reaction in Step 1 is nearly equal to the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$ k_{1}[A] \\approx k_{-1}[I] $$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the concentration of the intermediate $[I]$ in terms of the concentration of reactant $[A]$:\n$$ [I] = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[I]$ into the rate equation for product formation yields the rate law:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A] \\right) [B] = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A][B] $$\nThe problem asks for the initial rate, $r_{\\text{true}} = \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[P]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right|_{t \\to 0^{+}}$. At $t=0$, the concentrations of the reactants are their initial values, $[A] = [A]_{0}$ and $[B] = [B]_{0}$. Thus, the true initial rate is:\n$$ r_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A]_{0}[B]_{0} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $k_{1} = 10\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{-1} = 10\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{2} = 100\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, $[A]_{0} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{M}$, and $[B]_{0} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{M}$:\n$$ r_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{(10\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(100\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1})}{10\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} (5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{M})(1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{M}) $$\n$$ r_{\\text{true}} = (100\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}) (5.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{2}) $$\n$$ r_{\\text{true}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Incorrect Rate ($r_{\\text{wrong}}$)**\n\nThe student's reasoning is flawed. The rate-determining step (RDS) is the slowest step in the reaction sequence, which acts as a kinetic bottleneck. In this mechanism, Step 2 is explicitly stated to be \"slow\" and is therefore the RDS. A fast equilibrium step can never be the RDS. The student incorrectly identifies Step 1 as the RDS and writes the rate as its forward component. We are asked to compute the numerical result of this flawed assertion:\n$$ r_{\\text{wrong}} = k_{1}[A]_{0} $$\nUsing the given values $k_{1} = 10\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $[A]_{0} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{M}$:\n$$ r_{\\text{wrong}} = (10\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{M}) $$\n$$ r_{\\text{wrong}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Error Ratio ($E$)**\n\nThe error introduced by the student's misapplication is quantified by the dimensionless ratio $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{r_{\\text{wrong}}}{r_{\\text{true}}} $$\nUsing the values calculated above:\n$$ E = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{5.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{5.00}{5.00} \\times 10^{-2 - (-4)} = 1 \\times 10^{2} $$\n$$ E = 100 $$\nThe misapplication of the RDS concept leads to an overestimation of the initial rate by a factor of $100$. This large error highlights the importance of correctly applying kinetic approximations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{100}$$", "id": "2624199"}]}
