It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the expression for the local volumetric rate of entropy production, $\\sigma_s$, for an irreversible process. For diffusion in a one-dimensional, isothermal system, this is given by:\n$$ T \\sigma_s = -J \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux of the solute, $\\mu$ is its chemical potential, and $T$ is the constant absolute temperature.\n\nAccording to the formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, in the linear regime near equilibrium, the thermodynamic flux is proportional to its conjugate thermodynamic force. From the entropy production equation, the flux is identified as $J$ and the conjugate force as $X = -d\\mu/dx$. The linear phenomenological relation is therefore:\n$$ J = L X = -L \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} $$\nwhere $L$ is the phenomenological transport coefficient, which is positive definite ($L > 0$).\n\nThe problem specifies a dilute, non-electrolytic solution, for which the chemical potential $\\mu$ can be described by the ideal solution model:\n$$ \\mu(c) = \\mu^{\\circ}(T, P) + RT \\ln(c) $$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard-state chemical potential (a function of $T$ and pressure $P$, but not concentration $c$), $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $c$ is the molar concentration.\n\nTo establish the constitutive relation for $J$ in terms of the concentration field $c(x)$, we must first express the force, $-d\\mu/dx$, in terms of the concentration gradient, $dc/dx$. We use the chain rule of differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\frac{d\\mu}{dc} \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThe derivative of $\\mu$ with respect to $c$ is found from its definition:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(c) \\right) = \\frac{RT}{c} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the gradient of the chemical potential yields:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\left( \\frac{RT}{c} \\right) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nNow, we insert this expression for the chemical potential gradient into our linear phenomenological law for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = -L \\left( \\frac{RT}{c} \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) = -\\left(\\frac{LRT}{c}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThis equation is the derived constitutive relation. By comparing it to the empirical Fick's first law of diffusion, $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$, we can identify the diffusion coefficient $D$ as:\n$$ D = \\frac{LRT}{c} $$\nThe problem states that $D$ is a constant, which implies that the phenomenological coefficient $L$ must be directly proportional to the concentration $c$, a condition that is consistent with more detailed kinetic theories (e.g., the Einstein relation, where the mobility is constant for a dilute system). With $D$ taken as a given constant, the derived constitutive relation is precisely Fick's first law:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\n\nWe now apply this law to compute the steady molar flux for the given linear concentration profile:\n$$ c(x) = c_0 + ax $$\nThe concentration gradient is found by differentiating $c(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (c_0 + ax) = a $$\nSince the gradient is constant, the flux $J$ is also constant throughout the channel, which is a condition for a steady-state system with no internal sources or sinks. Substituting the gradient into the flux law gives:\n$$ J = -D a $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the steady molar flux.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the sign of $J$ when $a > 0$. If $a > 0$, the concentration gradient is positive, meaning the concentration increases in the positive $x$-direction. The second law of thermodynamics dictates that net transport of a species occurs spontaneously from a region of higher chemical potential (and thus higher concentration for an ideal solution) to a region of lower chemical potential. Consequently, the flux must be directed in the negative $x$-direction. Our result $J = -Da$ confirms this: since $D > 0$ and we assume $a > 0$, the product $-Da$ is negative, so $J < 0$.\n\nFinally, we determine the SI units for the molar flux $J$. Molar flux represents the amount of substance (in moles) that flows across a unit area per unit time. Therefore, its units in the International System of Units (SI) are moles per square meter per second, which is written as $\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. This is consistent with the units of the derived expression $J = -Da$: the units of $D$ are $\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the units of $a = dc/dx$ are $(\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3})/\\text{m} = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-4}$, so the product has units of $(\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-4}) = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-D a}\n$$", "id": "2640913"}, {"introduction": "In an inhomogeneous medium where the diffusion coefficient $D(\\mathbf{r})$ varies with position, the formulation of Fick's law requires careful consideration.

The decision must be based on fundamental principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics and the specified physical condition that a uniform concentration, $c_0$, represents a stationary (equilibrium) state in a closed, force-free system.\n\nAccording to linear irreversible thermodynamics, the flux of a species, $\\mathbf{J}$, is driven by the gradient of its chemical potential, $\\mu$. For a dilute solution, this relation is expressed as:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = -c M \\nabla\\mu $$\nwhere $c$ is the concentration and $M$ is the mobility of the solute particles. The mobility $M$ is a kinetic coefficient that can depend on position, $M(\\mathbf{r})$, in an inhomogeneous medium.\n\nThe mobility is related to the diffusion coefficient $D$ via the Einstein relation, which holds locally even in an inhomogeneous medium:\n$$ D(\\mathbf{r}) = M(\\mathbf{r}) k_B T $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The gradient of the chemical potential is therefore:\n$$ \\nabla\\mu = \\nabla\\mu^0(\\mathbf{r}) + k_B T \\frac{\\nabla c}{c} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the flux $\\mathbf{J}$ yields:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = -c \\frac{D(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T} \\left( \\nabla\\mu^0(\\mathbf{r}) + k_B T \\frac{\\nabla c}{c} \\right) = -\\frac{c D(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T} \\nabla\\mu^0(\\mathbf{r}) - D(\\mathbf{r}) \\nabla c $$\nThis is the general expression for the flux.\n\nThe problem provides a critical physical constraint: \"a spatially uniform concentration $c(\\mathbf{r},t)=c_0$ should be a stationary solution\". A stationary solution implies that the system is at equilibrium. At equilibrium, the net flux must be zero everywhere, $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{0}$, and the time derivative of concentration must be zero, $\\partial c/\\partial t = 0$.\n\nIf we set $c(\\mathbf{r}, t) = c_0$ (a constant), then its gradient is zero, $\\nabla c = \\mathbf{0}$. The flux expression under these conditions becomes:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = -\\frac{c_0 D(\\mathbf{r})}{k_B T} \\nabla\\mu^0(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nFor this to be an equilibrium state, we must have $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{0}$. Since $c_0 > 0$ and $D(\\mathbf{r}) > 0$, this requires that:\n$$ \\nabla\\mu^0(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis means the standard chemical potential $\\mu^0$ must be constant throughout the medium.

This means that this constitutive law predicts a non-zero flux even when the concentration is uniform. This \"spurious flux\" would transport material from regions of high diffusivity to regions of low diffusivity, causing the system to spontaneously unmix and move away from the uniform state of maximum entropy. This is a violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics for a closed, isothermal, force-free system. Therefore, this form is physically incorrect.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.

All necessary conditions and parameters are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation from the principle of conservation of mass. Consider a differential control volume element of the slab with area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$, from position $x$ to $x + \\Delta x$. The mass balance for the solute in this volume is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = \\text{Rate of Inflow} - \\text{Rate of Outflow} + \\text{Rate of Generation}\n$$\nIn mathematical terms, this is written as:\n$$\nA \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = (A J_x)|_x - (A J_x)|_{x+\\Delta x} + R (A \\Delta x)\n$$\nwhere $c(x,t)$ is the solute concentration, $J_x$ is the molar flux in the $x$-direction, and $R$ is the volumetric rate of reaction.

We are given two constitutive relations. First, Fick's first law defines the diffusive flux:\n$$\nJ_x = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusivity, which is stated to be a constant. Second, the solute is consumed by a first-order reaction with rate $R = -k c$, where $k$ is a positive rate constant. Substituting these into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - k c\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c\n$$\nThis is the general reaction-diffusion equation for this system. The problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, $c(x)$, which means the concentration does not change with time. Therefore, the accumulation term is zero: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial derivatives with respect to $x$ become ordinary derivatives, as $c$ is now only a function of $x$. The steady-state governing equation is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - k c = 0\n$$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} c = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nNext, we must state the boundary conditions.\n1. At the boundary $x=0$, the concentration is held at a constant value $c_0$:\n$$\nc(0) = c_0\n$$\n2. At the boundary $x=L$, the slab is impermeable.
