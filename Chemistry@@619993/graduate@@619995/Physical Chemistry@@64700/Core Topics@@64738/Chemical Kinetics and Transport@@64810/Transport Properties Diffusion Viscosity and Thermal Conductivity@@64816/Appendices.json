This is a classic problem in kinetic theory, solved by applying the Chapman-Enskog method to the Boltzmann equation. The derivation proceeds in several stages: first, linearizing the Boltzmann equation for a small perturbation from local equilibrium; second, solving for the perturbation using the first Sonine polynomial approximation; third, relating the perturbation to the shear stress to find $\\eta$; and finally, explicitly calculating the required collision integrals for the hard-sphere model.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation in the absence of external forces is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}} f = \\mathcal{C}[f,f]\n$$\nwhere $f(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}, t)$ is the velocity distribution function and $\\mathcal{C}[f,f]$ is the collision operator. The Chapman-Enskog expansion assumes that the distribution function $f$ can be written as a perturbation to the local Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution $f^{(0)}$:\n$$\nf = f^{(0)}(1 + \\Phi)\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is small. The local equilibrium distribution is given as:\n$$\nf^{(0)} = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi k_{B} T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m C^2}{2 k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{r})$ is the peculiar velocity.\n\nTo first order in the gradients of the macroscopic fields ($n, T, \\mathbf{u}$), the Boltzmann equation linearizes to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}}\\right)f^{(0)} = \\mathcal{C}[f,f] \\approx \\mathcal{C}[f^{(0)}, f^{(0)}(1+\\Phi)] + \\mathcal{C}[f^{(0)}(1+\\Phi), f^{(0)}] \\equiv n^2 \\mathcal{L}[\\Phi]\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}[\\Phi]$ is the linearized collision operator. The term $\\mathcal{C}[f^{(0)}, f^{(0)}]$ vanishes. The left-hand side (LHS), representing the drift of the equilibrium distribution, acts as the source term that drives the system away from equilibrium.\nThe LHS can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{D}{Dt} + \\mathbf{C} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}}\\right)f^{(0)} - (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}} f^{(0)}) \\cdot \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = n^2 \\mathcal{L}[\\Phi]\n$$\nwhere $D/Dt = \\partial/\\partial t + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the material derivative. Using the Euler-level conservation equations and considering only the terms relevant to shear viscosity (i.e., gradients in $\\mathbf{u}$ with $\\nabla T=0, \\nabla n=0, \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0$), the linearized Boltzmann equation simplifies to:\n$$\nf^{(0)} \\frac{m}{k_{B} T} \\left(C_i C_j - \\frac{1}{3}C^2 \\delta_{ij}\\right) \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial r_j} = n^2 \\mathcal{L}[\\Phi]\n$$\nThe quantity on the left is a contraction of the symmetric traceless part of the velocity gradient tensor, $(\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^{(s,0)}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_j u_i + \\partial_i u_j)$, with the tensor $(C_i C_j - \\frac{1}{3}C^2 \\delta_{ij})$. For the specified shear flow $u_x = (\\partial u_x / \\partial y) y$, the only non-zero component is $\\partial u_x / \\partial y$, and the equation becomes:\n$$\nf^{(0)} \\frac{m}{k_{B} T} C_x C_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = n^2 \\mathcal{L}[\\Phi]\n$$\nThe solution for the perturbation $\\Phi$ must have the same tensorial structure as the source term. The first Sonine polynomial approximation consists of seeking a solution of the form:\n$$\n\\Phi = - B \\frac{m}{k_{B} T} \\left(C_i C_j - \\frac{1}{3}C^2 \\delta_{ij}\\right) \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial r_j}\n$$\nwhere $B$ is a scalar constant to be determined. For our specific flow, this is:\n$$\n\\Phi = - B \\frac{m}{k_{B} T} C_x C_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}\n$$\nTo solve for $B$, we substitute this ansatz back into the linearized equation and use a projection method. This is equivalent to using a variational principle. The result of this procedure for the first Sonine approximation relates the viscosity coefficient $\\eta$ directly to a collision integral $\\Omega^{(2,2)}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{5 k_B T}{8 \\Omega^{(2,2)}}\n$$\nThe problem demands we compute all integrals. Therefore, we must derive $\\Omega^{(2,2)}$ for hard spheres.

For rigid hard spheres of diameter $d$, the relationship between $b$ and $\\chi$ is $b = d \\cos(\\chi/2)$ for $b \\le d$. This can be rewritten as $\\cos\\chi = 2(b/d)^2 - 1$.

It represents a standard derivation in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We now construct the solution.\n\nThe state of the gas is described by the velocity distribution function $f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)$. In the Chapman-Enskog method, this function is expanded about a local equilibrium state:\n$$f = f^{(0)} + f^{(1)} + \\dots$$\nwhere $f^{(0)}$ is the local Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,\n$$f^{(0)} = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mc^2}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $n$, $T$, and $\\mathbf{u}$ are the local number density, temperature, and bulk velocity, respectively, and $\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}$ is the peculiar velocity. The term $f^{(1)}$ represents the first-order deviation from local equilibrium.\n\nA fundamental tenet of the Chapman-Enskog procedure is that the macroscopic variables $n$, $\\mathbf{u}$, and $T$ are defined completely by the zeroth-order distribution $f^{(0)}$. This imposes the following constraints on the first-order correction $f^{(1)}$:\n$$ \\int f^{(1)} d^3c = 0 $$\n$$ \\int m\\mathbf{c} f^{(1)} d^3c = 0 $$\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{2} m c^2 f^{(1)} d^3c = 0 $$\nThe third constraint, arising from the definition of local temperature $T$ based on the average kinetic energy of peculiar motion, is critical for this problem.\n\nThe pressure tensor $P_{ij}$ is defined as the second moment of the distribution function with respect to the peculiar velocity:\n$$P_{ij} = m \\int c_i c_j f d^3c = m \\int c_i c_j (f^{(0)} + f^{(1)}) d^3c = P_{ij}^{(0)} + P_{ij}^{(1)}$$\nThe zeroth-order term, $P_{ij}^{(0)}$, corresponds to the equilibrium pressure. Due to the isotropy of $f^{(0)}$, it is diagonal:\n$$P_{ij}^{(0)} = m \\int c_i c_j f^{(0)} d^3c = \\delta_{ij} p$$\nwhere $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure. We can verify this pressure is $p = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{P}^{(0)}) = \\frac{1}{3} m \\int c^2 f^{(0)} d^3c$. From the definition of temperature for a monatomic gas, $\\frac{3}{2} nk_B T = \\int \\frac{1}{2}m c^2 f^{(0)} d^3c$, it follows directly that $p=nk_B T$.\n\nThe problem asks for the bulk viscous pressure, $\\Pi$, which is the isotropic part of the non-equilibrium stress. Specifically, it is the trace of the first-order contribution to the pressure tensor, $P_{ij}^{(1)}$, divided by $3$:\n$$\\Pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_i P_{ii}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3} m \\int \\left(\\sum_i c_i^2\\right) f^{(1)} d^3c = \\frac{1}{3} m \\int c^2 f^{(1)} d^3c$$\nNow, we examine the constraint on $f^{(1)}$ related to the kinetic energy:\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{2} m c^2 f^{(1)} d^3c = 0$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\frac{m}{2} \\int c^2 f^{(1)} d^3c = 0$$\nSince $m \\neq 0$, this immediately implies:\n$$\\int c^2 f^{(1)} d^3c = 0$$\nSubstituting this result into our expression for the bulk viscous pressure $\\Pi$:\n$$\\Pi = \\frac{m}{3} \\left( \\int c^2 f^{(1)} d^3c \\right) = \\frac{m}{3} \\times 0 = 0$$\nThus, for a dilute monatomic gas described by purely elastic collisions, the first-order isotropic correction to the pressure is identically zero.\n\nThe bulk viscosity $\\zeta$ is defined as the coefficient of proportionality relating $\\Pi$ to the divergence of the velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\\Pi = -\\zeta (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$$\nWe have shown that $\\Pi=0$. This equality must hold for any small, slowly-varying flow, including compressional flows where $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\neq 0$. The only way for the equation $0 = -\\zeta (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$ to be valid for arbitrary non-zero values of $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ is if the coefficient $\\zeta$ is itself zero.\nTherefore, for a monatomic ideal gas, the bulk viscosity is $\\zeta = 0$. This result is a direct consequence of defining local temperature solely in terms of the average translational kinetic energy.\n\nThe second task is to explain why $\\zeta$ is generally non-zero for a dilute polyatomic gas.\nBulk viscosity represents a dissipative resistance to changes in volume. For a monatomic gas, compression increases the translational kinetic energy of the particles. Since temperature is directly proportional to this translational energy, the system remains in local thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to its internal energy distribution—there are no other internal modes to populate. The pressure and temperature change in lockstep.\n\nIn a polyatomic gas, molecules possess internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, in addition to translation. When the gas is compressed, the translational energy of the molecules increases first. This excess translational energy is then redistributed into the rotational and vibrational modes through inelastic collisions. This energy transfer is not instantaneous; it occurs over a characteristic relaxation time, $\\tau_{relax}$. If the compression or expansion occurs on a timescale comparable to or faster than $\\tau_{relax}$, the internal degrees of freedom will lag behind the translational degrees of freedom.\n\nDuring a rapid compression, the translational temperature rises, but the internal modes have not yet absorbed their equilibrium share of the energy. The pressure, which is dominated by translational motion, rises to a value higher than it would in a full equilibrium state. Conversely, during a rapid expansion, the translational modes cool faster, while the internal modes feed energy back into translation with a delay, causing the pressure to drop lower than its equilibrium value. This lag between translational and internal energy equilibration is an irreversible process that dissipates energy and produces entropy. This dissipative mechanism is the physical origin of bulk viscosity. Thus, for a polyatomic gas, $\\zeta$ is non-zero because there exists an internal energy reservoir with a finite relaxation time.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2684214"}, {"introduction": "This practice shifts our focus from viscosity to mass diffusion, exploring the deep connection between macroscopic transport equations and the microscopic world of thermal fluctuations.

We substitute this ansatz into the diffusion equation to determine the function $A(t)$.\n\nThe time derivative (left-hand side) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(c_0 + A(t)\\cos(kx)\\right) = \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\cos(kx).\n$$\nThe spatial derivatives for the right-hand side are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(c_0 + A(t)\\cos(kx)\\right) = -k A(t) \\sin(kx).\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-k A(t) \\sin(kx)\\right) = -k^2 A(t) \\cos(kx).\n$$\nSo, the right-hand side of the diffusion equation becomes:\n$$\nD \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} = -D k^2 A(t) \\cos(kx).\n$$\nEquating the left and right sides:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\cos(kx) = -D k^2 A(t) \\cos(kx).\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all $x$, so we can equate the coefficients of $\\cos(kx)$, which yields an ordinary differential equation for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = -D k^2 A(t).\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE with the solution $A(t) = A(0) \\exp(-D k^2 t)$. The initial amplitude $A(0)$ is determined from the initial condition $c(x,0) = c_0 + \\delta \\cos(kx)$, which implies $A(0) = \\delta$.\n\nTherefore, the time-dependent amplitude is:\n$$\nA(t) = \\delta \\exp(-D k^2 t).\n$$\nThe problem defines the decay rate $\\Gamma(k)$ through the relation $A(t) = \\delta \\exp(-\\Gamma(k) t)$. By direct comparison with our derived expression for $A(t)$, we identify the decay rate as:\n$$\n\\Gamma(k) = D k^2.\n$$\n\n(c) Determination of the Dynamic Structure Factor Line Shape:\n\nThe dynamics of a general concentration fluctuation $\\delta c(x,t)$ are governed by the same diffusion equation: $\\partial_t(\\delta c) = D \\partial_x^2(\\delta c)$. We analyze this equation in Fourier space. The Fourier mode $\\delta c_k(t)$ is defined as $\\delta c_k(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta c(x,t) \\exp(-ikx) dx$. Applying the Fourier transform to the PDE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\delta c_k(t) = D \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\delta c}{\\partial x^2} \\exp(-ikx) dx.\n$$\nIntegration by parts twice on the right side, assuming fluctuations vanish at infinity, yields a factor of $(ik)^2 = -k^2$. Thus, the PDE becomes an ODE in Fourier space for each mode $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\delta c_k(t) = -D k^2 \\delta c_k(t).\n$$\nThe solution for $t \\ge 0$ is $\\delta c_k(t) = \\delta c_k(0) \\exp(-D k^2 t)$.\n\nNow, we compute the normalized intermediate scattering function $F(k,t)$:\n$$\nF(k,t) = \\frac{\\langle \\delta c_k(t)\\,\\delta c_{-k}(0)\\rangle}{\\langle |\\delta c_k(0)|^2\\rangle}.\n$$\nSubstituting the solution for $\\delta c_k(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nF(k,t) = \\frac{\\langle \\delta c_k(0) \\exp(-D k^2 t)\\,\\delta c_{-k}(0)\\rangle}{\\langle |\\delta c_k(0)|^2\\rangle} = \\exp(-D k^2 t) \\frac{\\langle \\delta c_k(0)\\,\\delta c_{-k}(0)\\rangle}{\\langle |\\delta c_k(0)|^2\\rangle}.\n$$\nFor a real field $\\delta c(x,t)$, its Fourier transform has the property $\\delta c_{-k}(t) = (\\delta c_k(t))^*$. Thus, $\\delta c_k(0) \\delta c_{-k}(0) = \\delta c_k(0) (\\delta c_k(0))^* = |\\delta c_k(0)|^2$. The ensemble average of this quantity is $\\langle |\\delta c_k(0)|^2 \\rangle$. The expression for $F(k,t)$ simplifies to:\n$$\nF(k,t) = \\exp(-D k^2 t), \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0.\n$$\nThe dynamic structure factor $L(k,\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $F(k,t)$ over all time $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. For a system in thermal equilibrium, its time-correlation functions must be symmetric with respect to time reversal, meaning $F(k,t) = F(k,-t)$. We therefore extend the result to all $t$ as $F(k,t) = \\exp(-D k^2 |t|)$.\n\nLet $\\Gamma(k) = D k^2$. We must compute:\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\omega t) \\exp(-\\Gamma(k)|t|) dt.\n$$\nWe split the integral into two parts:\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp(i\\omega t) \\exp(\\Gamma(k)t) dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\omega t) \\exp(-\\Gamma(k)t) dt \\right].\n$$\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp((\\Gamma(k)+i\\omega)t) dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(\\Gamma(k)-i\\omega)t) dt \\right].\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\left.\\frac{\\exp((\\Gamma(k)+i\\omega)t)}{\\Gamma(k)+i\\omega}\\right|_{-\\infty}^0 + \\left.\\frac{\\exp(-(\\Gamma(k)-i\\omega)t)}{-(\\Gamma(k)-i\\omega)}\\right|_0^{\\infty} \\right].\n$$\nSince $\\Gamma(k) = D k^2 > 0$, the exponentials vanish at the limits $t \\to -\\infty$ and $t \\to \\infty$ respectively:\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)+i\\omega} - 0 + 0 - \\frac{1}{-(\\Gamma(k)-i\\omega)} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)+i\\omega} + \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(k)-i\\omega} \\right).\n$$\nCombining the fractions:\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{(\\Gamma(k)-i\\omega) + (\\Gamma(k)+i\\omega)}{(\\Gamma(k))^2 - (i\\omega)^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{2\\Gamma(k)}{(\\Gamma(k))^2 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(k)}{(\\Gamma(k))^2 + \\omega^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Gamma(k) = D k^2$, we obtain the Lorentzian line shape:\n$$\nL(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{D k^2}{(D k^2)^2 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{D k^2}{\\pi(D^2 k^4 + \\omega^2)}.\n$$\nThe three required results are:\n1. $A(t) = \\delta \\exp(-D k^2 t)$\n2. $\\Gamma(k) = D k^2$\n3. $L(k,\\omega) = \\frac{D k^2}{\\pi(D^2 k^4 + \\omega^2)}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} \\delta \\exp(-D k^2 t) & D k^2 & \\frac{D k^2}{\\pi (D^2 k^4 + \\omega^2)} \\end{bmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2684217"}]}
