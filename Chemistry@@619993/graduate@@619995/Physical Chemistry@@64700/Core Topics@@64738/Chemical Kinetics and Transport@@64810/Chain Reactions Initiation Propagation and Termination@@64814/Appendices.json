All terms are standard in the field of chemical kinetics.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, or unrealistic within the common idealizations of chemical kinetics. It is a standard, well-posed problem in physical chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Rate Law**\n\nThe rate of formation of product $B$, denoted $r_{B}$, is equivalent to the time derivative of its concentration, $\\frac{d[B]}{dt}$. Based on the stoichiometry of the provided elementary steps, species $B$ is formed only in the propagation step:\n$$R + A \\to R + B$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of this elementary step is given by $k_{p}[R][A]$. Therefore, the rate of formation of $B$ is:\n$$r_{B} = \\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_{p}[R][A]$$\nThis expression contains the concentration of the reactive intermediate, $[R]$, which is not a measurable parameter. To obtain a closed-form expression in terms of the given parameters, we must determine $[R]$ by applying the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA).\n\nThe QSSA posits that for a highly reactive, short-lived intermediate, its concentration rapidly reaches a state where its rate of formation is balanced by its rate of consumption. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{d[R]}{dt} \\approx 0$. We must first write the full rate expression for the species $R$.\n\n$R$ is formed in the initiation step and consumed in the termination step. In the propagation step, one molecule of $R$ is consumed and one is produced, resulting in no net change in the concentration of $R$.\n\n1.  **Rate of formation of R from Initiation ($I \\to 2R$)**:\n    The rate of this reaction is $k_{i}[I]$. Since two molecules of $R$ are produced for each molecule of $I$ that reacts, the rate of change of $[R]$ from this step is $+2k_{i}[I]$.\n\n2.  **Rate of change of R from Propagation ($R + A \\to R + B$)**:\n    The rate of this reaction is $k_{p}[R][A]$. One molecule of $R$ is consumed and one is produced, so the net rate of change of $[R]$ from this step is $-k_{p}[R][A] + k_{p}[R][A] = 0$.\n\n3.  **Rate of consumption of R from Termination ($2R \\to T$)**:\n    The rate of this reaction is $k_{t}[R]^2$. Since two molecules of $R$ are consumed, the rate of change of $[R]$ from this step is $-2k_{t}[R]^2$.\n\nCombining these contributions, the net rate of change of the concentration of the intermediate $R$ is:\n$$\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation}) - (\\text{rate of consumption})$$\n$$\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = 2k_{i}[I] - 2k_{t}[R]^2$$\nNow, we apply the QSSA by setting $\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = 0$:\n$$2k_{i}[I] - 2k_{t}[R]_{ss}^2 = 0$$\nwhere $[R]_{ss}$ denotes the steady-state concentration of the intermediate.\n\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $[R]_{ss}$:\n$$2k_{t}[R]_{ss}^2 = 2k_{i}[I]$$\n$$[R]_{ss}^2 = \\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}$$\nSince concentration must be a non-negative quantity, we take the positive square root:\n$$[R]_{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}}$$\nThis expression gives the steady-state concentration of the radical intermediate $R$ in terms of the known parameters.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[R]_{ss}$ back into the rate law for the formation of $B$:\n$$r_{B} = k_{p}[A][R]_{ss}$$\n$$r_{B} = k_{p}[A]\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the rate of formation of product $B$. It can be rearranged to group constants and concentrations separately:\n$$r_{B} = k_{p}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}}{k_{t}}}[A][I]^{1/2}$$\nThe rate of production is first-order with respect to $[A]$ and half-order with respect to the initiator concentration $[I]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_{p}[A]\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}}}\n$$", "id": "2631173"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical rate laws gain practical meaning when we use them to predict the outcome of real chemical reactions.

It is an objective, formal problem from physical chemistry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the stoichiometry of the elementary reaction step provided:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br} \\xrightarrow{k_{t}} \\mathrm{Br}_{2}\n$$\nThis is an elementary bimolecular process. The rate of this reaction, $v$, is given by a second-order rate law: $v = k_{t} [\\mathrm{Br}]^{2}$. The rate of change of the bromine atom concentration, $[\\mathrm{Br}]$, is related to the reaction rate $v$ by its stoichiometric coefficient, which is $-2$ since two $\\mathrm{Br}$ atoms are consumed in each reactive event. Therefore, the differential rate law governing the concentration $[\\mathrm{Br}](t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Br}]}{dt} = -2 v = -2 k_{t} [\\mathrm{Br}]^{2}\n$$\nIt is critical to include the stoichiometric factor of $2$ in this expression. This is a common point of error.\n\nTo find the time-dependent concentration $[\\mathrm{Br}](t)$, this differential equation must be solved subject to the initial condition $[\\mathrm{Br}](t=0) = [\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}$. The equation is separable:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{Br}]}{[\\mathrm{Br}]^{2}} = -2 k_{t} \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, [\\mathrm{Br}]_{0})$ to a later state $(t, [\\mathrm{Br}](t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{[\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}}^{[\\mathrm{Br}](t)} \\frac{d[\\mathrm{Br}]}{[\\mathrm{Br}]^{2}} = \\int_{0}^{t} -2 k_{t} \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{Br}]} \\right]_{[\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}}^{[\\mathrm{Br}](t)} = -2 k_{t} [t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{Br}](t)} + \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}} = -2 k_{t} t\n$$\nRearranging this gives the integrated rate law in its conventional form:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{Br}](t)} = \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}} + 2 k_{t} t\n$$\nTo obtain the explicit expression for $[\\mathrm{Br}](t)$, we solve for $[\\mathrm{Br}](t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{Br}](t)} = \\frac{1 + 2 k_{t} t [\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}}{[\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Br}](t) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}}{1 + 2 k_{t} t [\\mathrm{Br}]_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the first required result.\n\nNext, we must determine the rate constant $k_t$ using the experimental data. The problem states that the concentration is monitored via absorbance, which follows the Beer–Lambert law, $A(t) = \\varepsilon \\ell [\\mathrm{Br}](t)$. From this, we can express the concentration in terms of absorbance: $[\\mathrm{Br}](t) = \\frac{A(t)}{\\varepsilon \\ell}$.
