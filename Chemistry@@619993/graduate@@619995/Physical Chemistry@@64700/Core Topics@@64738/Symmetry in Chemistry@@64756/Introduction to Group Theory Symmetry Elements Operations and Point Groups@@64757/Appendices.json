The group is defined by the set of symmetry operations $G = \\{E, C_{2}(z), \\sigma_{v}(xz), \\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\}$. The method must be based on the fundamental action of these operations on a general point in three-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nWe adopt the specified right-handed Cartesian coordinate system where the molecule $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is placed such that the oxygen atom is at the origin, the principal $C_{2}$ axis coincides with the $z$-axis, and the molecular plane is the $xz$-plane. The action of each symmetry operation on a general point with coordinates $P = (x, y, z)$ is as follows:\n\n1.  Identity, $E$: This operation leaves the point unchanged.\n    $$E(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)$$\n2.  Rotation by $\\pi$ radians about the $z$-axis, $C_{2}(z)$: This operation negates the $x$ and $y$ coordinates.\n    $$C_{2}(z)(x, y, z) = (-x, -y, z)$$\n3.  Reflection in the $xz$-plane, $\\sigma_{v}(xz)$: This operation negates the $y$ coordinate.\n    $$\\sigma_{v}(xz)(x, y, z) = (x, -y, z)$$\n4.  Reflection in the $yz$-plane, $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)$: This operation negates the $x$ coordinate.\n    $$\\sigma_{v}'(yz)(x, y, z) = (-x, y, z)$$\n\nTo construct the multiplication table, we must compute the result of the composition $gh$ for all pairs of elements $g, h \\in G$. The composition $gh$ is defined as applying operation $h$ first, followed by operation $g$.\n\nThe products involving the identity element $E$ are trivial: for any $g \\in G$, $gE = Eg = g$.\n\nThe squares of the non-identity elements are:\n- $C_{2}(z)C_{2}(z)$: $C_{2}(z)(-x, -y, z) = (-(-x), -(-y), z) = (x, y, z)$. Thus, $C_{2}(z)^{2} = E$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}(xz)\\sigma_{v}(xz)$: $\\sigma_{v}(xz)(x, -y, z) = (x, -(-y), z) = (x, y, z)$. Thus, $\\sigma_{v}(xz)^{2} = E$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\sigma_{v}'(yz)$: $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)(-x, y, z) = (-(-x), y, z) = (x, y, z)$. Thus, $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)^{2} = E$.\nEvery element is its own inverse.\n\nNow we compute the mixed products. Let us demonstrate one case in detail, for instance, $C_{2}(z)\\sigma_{v}(xz)$:\n$$[C_{2}(z)\\sigma_{v}(xz)](x, y, z) = C_{2}(z)[\\sigma_{v}(xz)(x, y, z)] = C_{2}(z)(x, -y, z) = (-x, -(-y), z) = (-x, y, z)$$\nThe resulting transformation $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, y, z)$ is identical to the action of $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)$. Therefore, $C_{2}(z)\\sigma_{v}(xz) = \\sigma_{v}'(yz)$.\n\nWe systematically compute all other products in the same manner:\n- $C_{2}(z)\\sigma_{v}'(yz) = C_{2}(z)(-x, y, z) = (x, -y, z) = \\sigma_{v}(xz)$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}(xz)C_{2}(z) = \\sigma_{v}(xz)(-x, -y, z) = (-x, -(-y), z) = (-x, y, z) = \\sigma_{v}'(yz)$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}(xz)\\sigma_{v}'(yz) = \\sigma_{v}(xz)(-x, y, z) = (-x, -y, z) = C_{2}(z)$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)C_{2}(z) = \\sigma_{v}'(yz)(-x, -y, z) = (-(-x), -y, z) = (x, -y, z) = \\sigma_{v}(xz)$.\n- $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\sigma_{v}(xz) = \\sigma_{v}'(yz)(x, -y, z) = (-x, -y, z) = C_{2}(z)$.\n\nWith these results, we construct the complete multiplication table for the group $C_{2v}$. The row headers indicate the first operation ($g$) and the column headers indicate the second operation ($h$) in the product $gh$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\ngh & E & C_{2}(z) & \\sigma_{v}(xz) & \\sigma_{v}'(yz) \\\\\n\\hline\nE & E & C_{2}(z) & \\sigma_{v}(xz) & \\sigma_{v}'(yz) \\\\\nC_{2}(z) & C_{2}(z) & E & \\sigma_{v}'(yz) & \\sigma_{v}(xz) \\\\\n\\sigma_{v}(xz) & \\sigma_{v}(xz) & \\sigma_{v}'(yz) & E & C_{2}(z) \\\\\n\\sigma_{v}'(yz) & \\sigma_{v}'(yz) & \\sigma_{v}(xz) & C_{2}(z) & E \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to compute $N_{\\mathrm{nc}}$, the number of ordered pairs $(g, h) \\in G \\times G$ for which the commutative property fails, i.e., $gh \\neq hg$. We examine the multiplication table for non-commuting pairs. The commutativity of a pair $(g, h)$ is confirmed if the entry at row $g$, column $h$ is identical to the entry at row $h$, column $g$.\n\n- For $(C_{2}(z), \\sigma_{v}(xz))$: $C_{2}(z)\\sigma_{v}(xz) = \\sigma_{v}'(yz)$ and $\\sigma_{v}(xz)C_{2}(z) = \\sigma_{v}'(yz)$.

Thus, they commute.\n- For $(\\sigma_{v}(xz), \\sigma_{v}'(yz))$: $\\sigma_{v}(xz)\\sigma_{v}'(yz) = C_{2}(z)$ and $\\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\sigma_{v}(xz) = C_{2}(z)$. Thus, they commute.\n\nAll other pairs trivially commute (any element with itself or with the identity $E$). A visual inspection confirms that the multiplication table is symmetric with respect to its main diagonal. This demonstrates that $gh = hg$ for all $g, h \\in G$. Such a group is known as an Abelian group.\n\nThe quantity $N_{\\mathrm{nc}}$ is the count of ordered pairs $(g, h)$ where $gh \\neq hg$. Since we have rigorously established that $gh = hg$ for all elements in the group $C_{2v}$, there are no pairs that fail to commute.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-commuting ordered pairs is zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2646610"}, {"introduction": "A crucial practical skill for any chemist is the ability to correctly assign a molecule to its point group based on its three-dimensional structure.

The transformation for a $180^\\circ$ rotation about the $x$-axis is $(x, y, z) \\rightarrow (x, -y, -z)$.\nApplying this transformation to the ligand positions:\n- For $A_1$ at $\\frac{r_A}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$: The transformation yields $\\frac{r_A}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,-1,-1)$, which is the position of $A_2$. Since $A_1$ and $A_2$ are identical ligands, this mapping is valid.\n- For $A_2$ at $\\frac{r_A}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,-1,-1)$: The transformation yields $\\frac{r_A}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,-(-1),-(-1)) = \\frac{r_A}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$, which is the position of $A_1$. This mapping is also valid. Thus, $A_1 \\leftrightarrow A_2$.\n- For $B_1$ at $\\frac{r_B}{\\sqrt{3}}(-1,1,-1)$: The transformation yields $\\frac{r_B}{\\sqrt{3}}(-1,-1,-(-1)) = \\frac{r_B}{\\sqrt{3}}(-1,-1,1)$, which is the position of $B_2$.

In the absence of any higher-order rotation axes (which is the case, as any $C_3$ axis of the parent tetrahedron is broken by having two different ligand types), this $C_2$ axis is the principal axis.\n\nNext, we test for vertical mirror planes ($\\sigma_v$), which must contain the principal $C_2$ axis.

It does not lie on the plane.\n  Let's re-read the option A, which seems correct. \"mirror planes containing that axis given by $y+z=0$ and $y-z=0$\". Let's re-verify the reflection.\n  - Reflection across plane $y-z=0$ swaps $A_1 \\leftrightarrow A_1$ (it is on the plane, so invariant). No, the plane normal vector is $(0,1,-1)$. Let's use a reflection matrix or check the transformation more carefully. A point $(x,y,z)$ reflects to a point $(x',y',z')$. The midpoint must be on the plane, and the vector connecting them must be parallel to the normal. So $\\frac{y+y'}{2} - \\frac{z+z'}{2} = 0$, and $(x'-x, y'-y, z'-z)$ is parallel to $(0,1,-1)$. So $x'=x$, and $z'-z = -(y'-y)$. And $y' = z+y-z'$. This gives $y'=y-y+z = z$. And $z'=z-y+y' = z-y+z=2z-y$. Something is wrong.\n  The reflection across $y-z=0$ should swap the $y$ and $z$ coordinates for points relative to the plane. Wait, that's reflection across $y=z$ plane containing the origin.

It correctly identifies the $C_2$ axis but falsely claims that the mirror planes are destroyed by the condition $r_A \\neq r_B$. Our analysis demonstrated that two mirror planes exist regardless of whether $r_A=r_B$ or $r_A \\neq r_B$. One plane contains the $A$ ligands and swaps the $B$ ligands, while the other contains the $B$ ligands and swaps the $A$ ligands.

However, it incorrectly claims the point group becomes $D_{2d}$ when $r_A=r_B$. Even if the bond lengths are equal, the $S_4$ operation still maps a ligand of type $A$ to the position of a ligand of type $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are distinct chemical species, this operation is not a symmetry element.

For a symmetry operation $R$, only atoms whose positions are unchanged by $R$ contribute to $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(R)$, and each such atom contributes the trace of the $3\\times 3$ matrix acting on $(x,y,z)$ displacements at that atom.\n\nWe use the well-tested facts: for a proper rotation by angle $\\theta$, the trace is $1+2\\cos\\theta$; for a reflection in a plane, the trace is $1$; for a rotation by $\\pi$, the trace is $-1$.\n\nWe analyze each class in $D_{3h}$:\n\n- Class $E$: All $4$ atoms are fixed. The identity transformation on $(x,y,z)$ has trace $3$. Therefore $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(E)=4\\times 3=12$.\n\n- Class $2C_{3}$: A $C_{3}$ rotation by angle $\\theta=2\\pi/3$ about the principal axis leaves the central $\\mathrm{B}$ fixed and permutes the three $\\mathrm{F}$ atoms, so only $\\mathrm{B}$ contributes. The trace of a $C_{3}$ rotation is $1+2\\cos(2\\pi/3)=1+2(-\\tfrac{1}{2})=0$. Hence $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(C_{3})=0$.\n\n- Class $3C_{2}'$: Each $C_{2}'$ is a rotation by $\\pi$ about an in-plane axis through $\\mathrm{B}$ and one $\\mathrm{F}$. Atoms on the axis ($\\mathrm{B}$ and that $\\mathrm{F}$) are fixed; the other two $\\mathrm{F}$ atoms are exchanged. The trace of a rotation by $\\pi$ is $-1$. Two fixed atoms contribute, so $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(C_{2}')=2\\times(-1)=-2$.\n\n- Class $\\sigma_{h}$: Reflection in the molecular plane fixes all $4$ atoms. The trace for a planar reflection is $1$. Thus $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(\\sigma_{h})=4\\times 1=4$.\n\n- Class $2S_{3}$: Each $S_{3}$ is a $C_{3}$ followed by $\\sigma_{h}$. Only the central $\\mathrm{B}$ is fixed. The in-plane $(x,y)$ block undergoes a $C_{3}$ with trace $2\\cos(2\\pi/3)=-1$, and the $z$ coordinate is mapped to $-z$ by $\\sigma_{h}$ contributing $-1$ to the trace, so the total trace is $-1+(-1)=-2$. Therefore $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(S_{3})=-2$.\n\n- Class $3\\sigma_{v}$: Each vertical mirror plane contains the principal axis and one B-F bond; $\\mathrm{B}$ and the corresponding $\\mathrm{F}$ are fixed. The trace for a vertical reflection is $1$. Two fixed atoms contribute, so $\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(\\sigma_{v})=2\\times 1=2$.\n\nCollecting these in the class order $[E, 2C_{3}, 3C_{2}', \\sigma_{h}, 2S_{3}, 3\\sigma_{v}]$, the characters for the reducible representation are:\n$\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}} = [12, 0, -2, 4, -2, 2]$.\n\nStep 2: Reduction of $\\Gamma_{3N}$.\n\nThe reduction formula is\n$$\na_{i}=\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{R} n_{R}\\,\\chi^{\\Gamma_{3N}}(R)\\,\\chi^{(i)}(R)^{*},\n$$\nwith $h=12$ and class sizes $[n_{E}=1, n_{2C_{3}}=2, n_{3C_{2}'}=3, n_{\\sigma_{h}}=1, n_{2S_{3}}=2, n_{3\\sigma_{v}}=3]$.\n\nWe compute $a_{i}$ for each irreducible representation.\n\n- For $A_{1}^{\\prime}: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$:\n$$\na(A_{1}^{\\prime})=\\frac{1}{12}\\Big(1\\cdot 12\\cdot 1+2\\cdot 0\\cdot 1+3\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 1+1\\cdot 4\\cdot 1+2\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 1+3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\Big)=\\frac{12}{12}=1.\n$$\n\n- For $A_{2}^{\\prime}: [1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1]$:\n$$\na(A_{2}^{\\prime})=\\frac{1}{12}\\Big(1\\cdot 12\\cdot 1+2\\cdot 0\\cdot 1+3\\cdot(-2)\\cdot(-1)+1\\cdot 4\\cdot 1+2\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 1+3\\cdot 2\\cdot(-1)\\Big)=\\frac{12}{12}=1.\n$$\n\n- For $E^{\\prime}: [2, -1, 0, 2, -1, 0]$:\n$$\na(E^{\\prime})=\\frac{1}{12}\\Big(1\\cdot 12\\cdot 2+2\\cdot 0\\cdot(-1)+3\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 0+1\\cdot 4\\cdot 2+2\\cdot(-2)\\cdot(-1)+3\\cdot 2\\cdot 0\\Big)=\\frac{36}{12}=3.\n$$\n\n- For $A_{1}^{\\prime\\prime}: [1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1]$:\n$$\na(A_{1}^{\\prime\\prime})=\\frac{1}{12}\\Big(1\\cdot 12\\cdot 1+2\\cdot 0\\cdot 1+3\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 1+1\\cdot 4\\cdot(-1)+2\\cdot(-2)\\cdot(-1)+3\\cdot 2\\cdot(-1)\\Big)=\\frac{0}{12}=0.\n$$\n\n- For $A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}: [1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1]$:\n$$\na(A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime})=\\frac{1}{12}\\Big(1\\cdot 12\\cdot 1+2\\cdot 0\\cdot 1+3\\cdot(-2)\\cdot(-1)+1\\cdot 4\\cdot(-1)+2\\cdot(-2)\\cdot(-1)+3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\Big)=\\frac{24}{12}=2.\n$$\n\n- For $E^{\\prime\\prime}: [2, -1, 0, -2, 1, 0]$:\n$$\na(E^{\\prime\\prime})=\\frac{1}{12}\\Big(1\\cdot 12\\cdot 2+2\\cdot 0\\cdot(-1)+3\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 0+1\\cdot 4\\cdot(-2)+2\\cdot(-2)\\cdot 1+3\\cdot 2\\cdot 0\\Big)=\\frac{12}{12}=1.\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\Gamma_{3N}=A_{1}^{\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime}\\oplus 3E^{\\prime}\\oplus 2A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}\\oplus E^{\\prime\\prime}.\n$$\nA dimension check gives $1+1+3\\cdot 2+2\\cdot 1+2=12$, as required.\n\nStep 3: Vibrational representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$.\n\nThe translational and rotational representations are $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}}=E^{\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}}=E^{\\prime\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime}$. Subtracting these from $\\Gamma_{3N}$ yields\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}=\\Gamma_{3N}-\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}}-\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}}\n= \\Big(A_{1}^{\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime}\\oplus 3E^{\\prime}\\oplus 2A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}\\oplus E^{\\prime\\prime}\\Big)-\\Big(E^{\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}\\Big)-\\Big(E^{\\prime\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime}\\Big).\n$$\nCanceling like terms gives\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}=A_{1}^{\\prime}\\oplus 2E^{\\prime}\\oplus A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}.\n$$\n\nStep 4: Degeneracies and the requested number.\n\nIn $D_{3h}$, $A$-type irreducible representations are one-dimensional (nondegenerate) and $E$-type irreducible representations are two-dimensional (doubly degenerate). Thus $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ corresponds to one nondegenerate $A_{1}^{\\prime}$ mode, one nondegenerate $A_{2}^{\\prime\\prime}$ mode, and two doubly degenerate $E^{\\prime}$ modes. The number of doubly degenerate vibrational normal modes (i.e., the number of distinct $E$-type modes) is therefore $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2646621"}]}
