For high-spin configurations, electrons maximize spin and occupy orbitals to minimize pairing while following the octahedral splitting.\n\nCompute high-spin occupancies:\n- For $d^{6}$: high spin gives $t_{2g}^{4} e_{g}^{2}$.\n- For $d^{4}$: high spin gives $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{1}$.\n- For $d^{5}$: high spin gives $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{2}$.\n- For $d^{10}$: fully filled gives $t_{2g}^{6} e_{g}^{4}$.\n\nThe Jahn-Teller theorem states that any nonlinear molecule with a degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a distortion to lift the degeneracy. In octahedral complexes, a strong Jahn-Teller effect arises when there is an uneven occupancy of the $e_{g}$ set (because $e_{g}$ orbitals are directly antibonding along metal-ligand axes), notably for $e_{g}^{1}$ or $e_{g}^{3}$ configurations. Weaker effects can occur for uneven $t_{2g}$ occupancy but are typically much smaller.\n\nEvaluate each case:\n- $Fe^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^{4} e_{g}^{2}$: the $e_{g}$ set is symmetrically occupied with one electron in each orbital. The asymmetrically occupied $t_{2g}$ orbitals lead to a weak Jahn-Teller effect. Thus, significant distortion is not expected.\n- $Cr^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{1}$: this has an asymmetrically occupied $e_{g}$ set ($e_{g}^{1}$), which is the canonical strong Jahn-Teller active case in octahedral fields, leading to significant distortion.\n- $Mn^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^{3} e_{g}^{2}$: all orbitals are half-filled with no orbital degeneracy in the ground state; Jahn-Teller distortion is negligible.\n- $Zn^{2+}$, $t_{2g}^{6} e_{g}^{4}$: completely filled $d$ subshell; no orbital degeneracy; no Jahn-Teller distortion.\n\nTherefore, the complex expected to exhibit a significant geometric distortion in a high-spin octahedral field is that of $Cr^{2+}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294579"}, {"introduction": "Once a system is identified as Jahn-Teller active, the next step is to understand the nature of the resulting distortion and its effect on the electronic structure. This exercise explores the energetic consequences of a specific geometric change—axial compression—on a classic $d^9$ octahedral complex. By relating the change in metal-ligand distances to the energies of the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, you will gain a mechanistic insight into how the distortion lifts the degeneracy of the $e_g$ set to achieve a lower energy state [@problem_id:2294591].", "problem": "An octahedral transition metal complex with a $d^9$ electronic configuration, such as $\\text{[Cu(H}_2\\text{O)}_6\\text{]}^{2+}$, is subject to a geometric distortion known as the Jahn-Teller effect.

In a $d^{9}$ complex, the uneven occupancy of the $e_{g}$ set leads to a Jahn-Teller distortion to remove degeneracy and lower the total electronic energy.\n\nConsider an axial compression along $z$, defined by metal–ligand distances $R_{z}  R_{xy}$. The ligand–field (electrostatic plus covalent) repulsion for an orbital with electron density directed toward a ligand increases as the metal–ligand distance decreases. Qualitatively, the change in orbital energy due to ligands along a given axis is monotonic in $R^{-n}$ with $n > 0$, so decreasing $R_{z}$ increases the repulsion for orbitals whose lobes point along $z$ relative to those that do not. Therefore:\n- The $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital, which has lobes along the $z$ axis, experiences increased repulsion from the now-closer axial ligands, so its energy is raised (destabilized).\n- The $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital, which lies in the $xy$ plane and interacts primarily with the equatorial ligands (at the longer $R_{xy}$ compared to $R_{z}$ in a compression), is relatively stabilized (lowered in energy) compared to $d_{z^{2}}$.\n\nThus, under axial compression the ordering becomes\n$$\nE(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}})  E(d_{z^{2}}),\n$$\nwhich corresponds to the statement that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ is stabilized and $d_{z^{2}}$ is destabilized. Options asserting maintained $e_{g}$ degeneracy or exclusive $t_{2g}$ splitting are incorrect for this situation, and the reverse statement corresponds to axial elongation, not compression.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital is stabilized and the $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital is destabilized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294591"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative predictions, physical chemistry provides quantitative models to describe the Jahn-Teller effect.
