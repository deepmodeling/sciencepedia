It is well-posed, providing all necessary information—specifically the barycenter conservation rule and the definition of $\\Delta_{o}$—to unambiguously derive the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbitals and subsequently the LFSE for all required configurations. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions, pseudoscience, or ambiguity. It is a formalizable problem central to the topic of physical chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe foundation of this derivation rests upon the barycenter conservation rule. In a hypothetical spherical field, all five $d$-orbitals are degenerate. We define the energy of this degenerate manifold as zero. In an octahedral ligand field, this degeneracy is lifted, and the orbitals split into two sets: a triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set and a doubly degenerate $e_{g}$ set. Let the degeneracy of these sets be $g_{t_{2g}}=3$ and $g_{e_{g}}=2$, and their respective energies relative to the barycenter be $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_{g}}$.\n\nThe barycenter conservation principle requires that the degeneracy-weighted average energy of the split levels remains at zero:\n$$g_{t_{2g}} E_{t_{2g}} + g_{e_{g}} E_{e_{g}} = 0$$\nSubstituting the degeneracy values:\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{e_{g}} = 0$$\nThis is our first equation. The second equation is provided by the definition of the octahedral splitting parameter, $\\Delta_{o}$, which is the energy difference between the two sets:\n$$E_{e_{g}} - E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta_{o}$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations. From the first equation, we express $E_{e_{g}}$ in terms of $E_{t_{2g}}$:\n$$E_{e_{g}} = -\\frac{3}{2} E_{t_{2g}}$$\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$$(-\\frac{3}{2} E_{t_{2g}}) - E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta_{o}$$\n$$-\\frac{5}{2} E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta_{o}$$\nThis yields the energy of the $t_{2g}$ level:\n$$E_{t_{2g}} = -\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_{o}$$\nThe energy of the $e_{g}$ level is then:\n$$E_{e_{g}} = -\\frac{3}{2} \\left(-\\frac{2}{5} \\Delta_{o}\\right) = +\\frac{3}{5} \\Delta_{o}$$\nThe problem requires the result in units of $Dq$, using the relation $\\Delta_{o} = 10\\,Dq$.\n$$E_{t_{2g}} = -\\frac{2}{5} (10\\,Dq) = -4\\,Dq$$\n$$E_{e_{g}} = +\\frac{3}{5} (10\\,Dq) = +6\\,Dq$$\nThe Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) is the net energy change of the $d$-electrons upon moving from the spherical field to the octahedral field. For a configuration $t_{2g}^{p} e_{g}^{q}$, where $p$ is the number of electrons in the $t_{2g}$ set and $q$ is the number of electrons in the $e_{g}$ set, the LFSE is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{LFSE} = p \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + q \\cdot E_{e_{g}} = p(-4\\,Dq) + q(+6\\,Dq) = (-4p + 6q)\\,Dq$$\nWe now systematically determine the electron configuration and LFSE for each $d^{n}$ case, for $n=1$ to $n=10$, under the high-spin assumption. This assumption, a consequence of Hund's first rule, dictates that electrons will occupy all orbitals singly before any pairing occurs. In an octahedral field, this means electrons\noccupy the higher-energy $e_{g}$ orbitals after the $t_{2g}$ set is half-filled, rather than pairing in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n\n- **$d^1$**: Configuration is $t_{2g}^{1} e_{g}^{0}$. $p=1, q=0$.

The problem also provides the theoretical reduced energies $f_i$ for transitions to the excited states $^{1}T_{1g}$, $^{1}T_{2g}$, and $^{1}E_{g}$ (in that order) at three discrete values of $x$. According to ligand field theory for low-spin $d^6$ complexes, the energies of these excited states are expected to be in ascending order. Therefore, it is a necessary and standard step to assign the experimental energies accordingly:\n- $E(^{1}A_{1g} \\rightarrow \\,^{1}T_{1g}) = 17{,}600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- $E(^{1}A_{1g} \\rightarrow \\,^{1}T_{2g}) = 22{,}400\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- $E(^{1}A_{1g} \\rightarrow \\,^{1}E_{g}) = 28{,}000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n\nLet the vector of experimental energies be $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{exp}} = (17600, 22400, 28000)\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nLet the vector of theoretical reduced energies for a given $x$ be $\\mathbf{f}(x) = (f_{1}(x), f_{2}(x), f_{3}(x))$.\n\nThe best-fit parameters are those that minimize the sum of squared residuals, $S$:\n$$S(x, B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (E_{\\text{th},i} - E_{\\text{exp},i})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (B \\cdot f_{i}(x) - E_{\\text{exp},i})^2$$\n\nFor a fixed value of $x$, say $x_k$, the optimal value of $B$ (let's call it $B_k$) is found by setting the partial derivative of $S$ with respect to $B$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial B} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} 2 (B \\cdot f_{i}(x_k) - E_{\\text{exp},i}) \\cdot f_{i}(x_k) = 0$$\n$$B \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (f_{i}(x_k))^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_{\\text{exp},i} \\cdot f_{i}(x_k) = 0$$\nThis yields the standard linear least-squares solution for the scaling factor $B_k$:\n$$B_k = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_{\\text{exp},i} \\cdot f_{i}(x_k)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (f_{i}(x_k))^2}$$\n\nWe must evaluate $B_k$ and the corresponding minimum sum of squares, $S_k = S(x_k, B_k)$, for each of the three candidate values of $x$ provided.\n\nCase 1: $x = 2.00$\nThe reduced energies are $\\mathbf{f}(2.00) = (20.4, 26.2, 32.1)$.\n$\\sum E_{\\text{exp},i} f_{i}(2.00) = 17600 \\cdot 20.4 + 22400 \\cdot 26.2 + 28000 \\cdot 32.1 = 359040 + 586880 + 898800 = 1844720$.\n$\\sum (f_{i}(2.00))^2 = 20.4^2 + 26.2^2 + 32.1^2 = 416.16 + 686.44 + 1030.41 = 2133.01$.\n$B_{1} = \\frac{1844720}{2133.01} \\approx 864.84\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThe sum of squares $S_1$ for this fit would be non-zero.\n\nCase 2: $x = 2.20$\nThe reduced energies are $\\mathbf{f}(2.20) = (22.0, 28.0, 35.0)$.\n$\\sum E_{\\text{exp},i} f_{i}(2.20) = 17600 \\cdot 22.0 + 22400 \\cdot 28.0 + 28000 \\cdot 35.0 = 387200 + 627200 + 980000 = 1994400$.\n$\\sum (f_{i}(2.20))^2 = 22.0^2 + 28.0^2 + 35.0^2 = 484 + 784 + 1225 = 2493$.\n$B_{2} = \\frac{1994400}{2493} = 800.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThis is an exact integer. Let us check the quality of this fit by calculating the theoretical energies using $B_2 = 800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:\n$E_{\\text{th},1} = 800 \\cdot 22.0 = 17600\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$E_{\\text{th},2} = 800 \\cdot 28.0 = 22400\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n$E_{\\text{th},3} = 800 \\cdot 35.0 = 28000\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThe calculated theoretical energies, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{th}} = (17600, 22400, 28000)\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, perfectly match the experimental data $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{exp}}$. This indicates a perfect fit. The sum of squared residuals for this case is exactly zero: $S_2 = 0$.\n\nThis result arises because the ratios of the experimental energies, $17600:22400:28000$, simplify to $176:224:280$, which further simplifies to $22:28:35$ upon division by $800$. This matches the ratios of the reduced energies for $x=2.20$. Such a perfect correspondence makes further investigation of other $x$ values unnecessary for finding the best fit, as the sum of squared residuals cannot be less than zero.\n\nThus, the best-fit parameters are unequivocally determined as $x = 2.20$ and $B = 800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the nephelauxetic ratio, $\\beta$, defined as the ratio of the Racah parameter in the complex ($B$) to that in the free gas-phase ion ($B_{\\mathrm{free}}$):\n$$\\beta = \\frac{B}{B_{\\mathrm{free}}}$$\nGiven $B_{\\mathrm{free}} = 1{,}120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and having found $B = 800\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{800}{1120} = \\frac{80}{112} = \\frac{10}{14} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nAs a decimal, $\\beta \\approx 0.7142857...$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\nTherefore, $\\beta \\approx 0.7143$.\nThis value, being less than $1$, correctly indicates a reduction in interelectronic repulsion upon formation of the complex due to electron cloud expansion, which is the physical meaning of the nephelauxetic effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7143}$$", "id": "2633979"}]}
