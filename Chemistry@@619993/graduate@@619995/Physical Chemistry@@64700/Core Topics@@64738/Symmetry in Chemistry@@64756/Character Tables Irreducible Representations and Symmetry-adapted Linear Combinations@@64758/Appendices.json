It requires the application of fundamental principles of group representation theory to derive the character table for the $C_{3v}$ point group and subsequently compute the determinant of a matrix formed from these characters. The givens are consistent with established theory and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by constructing the character table for the $C_{3v}$ group. The group order is $h=6$. There are three classes of symmetry operations: $C_1=\\{E\\}$ of size $n_1=1$, $C_2=\\{C_3, C_3^2\\}$ of size $n_2=2$, and $C_3=\\{\\sigma_v\\}$ of size $n_3=3$. The problem stipulates that there are three irreducible representations (irreps), which is consistent with the number of classes. The dimensions of these irreps, $l_i$, are given as one two-dimensional irrep and two one-dimensional irreps. Let us label them $\\Gamma_E$, $\\Gamma_{A_1}$, and $\\Gamma_{A_2}$ respectively, with dimensions $l_E=2$, $l_{A_1}=1$, and $l_{A_2}=1$. We verify this against the sum-of-squares rule: $\\sum_i l_i^2 = l_{A_1}^2 + l_{A_2}^2 + l_E^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 1+1+4 = 6$, which correctly equals the group order $h=6$.\n\nThe character, $\\chi_i(g)$, of a symmetry operation $g$ in the $i$-th irrep is constant for all operations within a class. The character of the identity operation, $\\chi_i(E)$, is always equal to the dimension of the irrep, $l_i$. This allows us to populate the first column of the character table. Let the columns correspond to the classes $E$, $2C_3$, and $3\\sigma_v$, and the rows to the irreps $A_1$, $A_2$, and $E$.\n\nThe initial structure of the character table is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v \\\\\n\\hline\nA_1 & 1 & \\chi_{A_1}(C_3) & \\chi_{A_1}(\\sigma_v) \\\\\nA_2 & 1 & \\chi_{A_2}(C_3) & \\chi_{A_2}(\\sigma_v) \\\\\nE   & 2 & \\chi_{E}(C_3) & \\chi_{E}(\\sigma_v)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nOne of the one-dimensional irreps must be the totally symmetric representation, conventionally denoted $A_1$, for which all characters are $+1$. Thus, the first row is $(1, 1, 1)$. We can verify its normalization using the row orthogonality relation, $\\sum_k n_k |\\chi_i(C_k)|^2 = h$:\n$$1 \\cdot (1)^2 + 2 \\cdot (1)^2 + 3 \\cdot (1)^2 = 1+2+3 = 6 = h$$\nThis confirms the validity of the $A_1$ characters.\n\nNow we determine the characters for the second one-dimensional irrep, $A_2$. Let its characters for the classes $C_3$ and $\\sigma_v$ be $a$ and $b$, respectively. The orthogonality of the $A_1$ and $A_2$ irreps requires $\\sum_k n_k \\chi_{A_1}(C_k) \\chi_{A_2}(C_k) = 0$:\n$$1 \\cdot (1)(1) + 2 \\cdot (1)(a) + 3 \\cdot (1)(b) = 0 \\implies 1 + 2a + 3b = 0$$\nThe normalization condition for the $A_2$ irrep is $\\sum_k n_k |\\chi_{A_2}(C_k)|^2 = h$:\n$$1 \\cdot (1)^2 + 2 \\cdot a^2 + 3 \\cdot b^2 = 6 \\implies 1 + 2a^2 + 3b^2 = 6 \\implies 2a^2 + 3b^2 = 5$$\nFor a one-dimensional representation, the character of a group element $g$ of order $m$ must be an $m$-th root of unity. The order of $C_3$ is $3$, and the order of $\\sigma_v$ is $2$. Since the problem states the characters are real-valued, $a$ must be $1$ (the only real cube root of unity other than for the trivial action), and $b$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\nIf $a=1$, the first equation gives $1 + 2(1) + 3b = 0 \\implies 3b = -3 \\implies b = -1$.\nLet us check these values with the normalization equation: $2(1)^2 + 3(-1)^2 = 2+3=5$. The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the characters for $A_2$ are $(1, 1, -1)$.\n\nFinally, we determine the characters for the two-dimensional irrep, $E$. Let its characters for the classes $C_3$ and $\\sigma_v$ be $c$ and $d$. We use orthogonality with the other two irreps.\nOrthogonality with $A_1$: $\\sum_k n_k \\chi_{A_1}(C_k) \\chi_E(C_k) = 0$\n$$1 \\cdot (1)(2) + 2 \\cdot (1)(c) + 3 \\cdot (1)(d) = 0 \\implies 2 + 2c + 3d = 0$$\nOrthogonality with $A_2$: $\\sum_k n_k \\chi_{A_2}(C_k) \\chi_E(C_k) = 0$\n$$1 \\cdot (1)(2) + 2 \\cdot (1)(c) + 3 \\cdot (-1)(d) = 0 \\implies 2 + 2c - 3d = 0$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $c$ and $d$:\n1) $2c + 3d = -2$\n2) $2c - 3d = -2$\nAdding the two equations yields $4c = -4$, so $c = -1$.\nSubstituting $c=-1$ into the first equation: $2(-1) + 3d = -2 \\implies -2 + 3d = -2 \\implies 3d = 0$, so $d = 0$.\nThe characters for the $E$ irrep are $(2, -1, 0)$.\nThe completed character table for $C_{3v}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v \\\\\n\\hline\nA_1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\nA_2 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\nE   & 2 & -1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the determinant of the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, whose $(i,j)$ entry is the character of the $i$-th irrep on the $j$-th class, with row order $(A_1, A_2, E)$ and column order $(E, C_3, \\sigma_v)$.

Then interpret the contents physically by identifying a complete set of quadratic forms built from $(x,y)$ that span $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$ and identifying the axial quantity associated with $\\wedge^{2}(E)$ in $C_{3v}$ (for example, a rotation-like pseudovector).

It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the decomposition of the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of the two-dimensional irreducible representation $E$ of the point group $C_{3v}$. Let $\\Gamma$ be a representation with character $\\chi_{\\Gamma}(R)$ for a symmetry operation $R$. The characters of the symmetric square, $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(\\Gamma)$, and the antisymmetric square, $\\wedge^{2}(\\Gamma)$, are given by the following fundamental formulae:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(\\Gamma)}(R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{\\Gamma}(R)]^{2} + \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R^{2}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\chi_{\\wedge^{2}(\\Gamma)}(R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{\\Gamma}(R)]^{2} - \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R^{2}) \\right)\n$$\nWe apply these formulae to the representation $E$ of $C_{3v}$, for which the characters are given as $\\chi_{E}(E)=2$, $\\chi_{E}(C_{3})=-1$, and $\\chi_{E}(\\sigma_{v})=0$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the operation $R^{2}$ for a representative element $R$ from each conjugacy class.\nFor the class $\\{E\\}$, $R=E$, so $R^{2}=E^{2}=E$.\nFor the class $\\{2C_{3}\\}$, we take $R=C_{3}$. Then $R^{2}=C_{3}^{2}=C_{3}^{-1}$. Since $C_{3}$ and $C_{3}^{-1}$ belong to the same conjugacy class, their characters are identical: $\\chi_{E}(C_{3}^{2}) = \\chi_{E}(C_{3}) = -1$.\nFor the class $\\{3\\sigma_{v}\\}$, we take $R=\\sigma_{v}$. Then $R^{2}=\\sigma_{v}^{2}=E$. Thus, $\\chi_{E}(\\sigma_{v}^{2}) = \\chi_{E}(E) = 2$.\n\nWith these results, we can compute the characters for $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$ and $\\wedge^{2}(E)$.\n\nFor the symmetric square, $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$:\n- $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)}(E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{E}(E)]^{2} + \\chi_{E}(E^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (2)^{2} + 2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(4+2) = 3$.\n- $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)}(C_{3}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{E}(C_{3})]^{2} + \\chi_{E}(C_{3}^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (-1)^{2} + (-1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$.\n- $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)}(\\sigma_{v}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{E}(\\sigma_{v})]^{2} + \\chi_{E}(\\sigma_{v}^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (0)^{2} + 2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+2) = 1$.\nThe character for the reducible representation $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$ is therefore $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)} = (3, 0, 1)$.\n\nFor the antisymmetric square, $\\wedge^{2}(E)$:\n- $\\chi_{\\wedge^{2}(E)}(E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{E}(E)]^{2} - \\chi_{E}(E^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (2)^{2} - 2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(4-2) = 1$.\n- $\\chi_{\\wedge^{2}(E)}(C_{3}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{E}(C_{3})]^{2} - \\chi_{E}(C_{3}^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (-1)^{2} - (-1) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(1+1) = 1$.\n- $\\chi_{\\wedge^{2}(E)}(\\sigma_{v}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [\\chi_{E}(\\sigma_{v})]^{2} - \\chi_{E}(\\sigma_{v}^{2}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (0)^{2} - 2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0-2) = -1$.\nThe character for the representation $\\wedge^{2}(E)$ is therefore $\\chi_{\\wedge^{2}(E)} = (1, 1, -1)$.\n\nNext, we reduce these representations into their irreducible components. The multiplicity $m_{i}$ of an irreducible representation $\\Gamma_{i}$ within a reducible representation $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is given by the reduction formula:\n$$\nm_{i} = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{k} n_{k} \\chi_{\\mathrm{red}}(C_{k}) \\chi_{i}(C_{k})^{*}\n$$\nwhere $|G|=6$ is the order of the group, $n_{k}$ is the number of elements in class $k$, and the sum is over all conjugacy classes. The characters are real, so $\\chi^{*} = \\chi$. The classes are $\\{E\\}$ ($n_E=1$), $\\{2C_3\\}$ ($n_{C_3}=2$), and $\\{3\\sigma_v\\}$ ($n_{\\sigma_v}=3$).\n\nReduction of $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$ with $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)} = (3, 0, 1)$:\n- $m_{A_{1}}^{(\\mathrm{sym})} = \\frac{1}{6} [1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+0+3) = 1$.\n- $m_{A_{2}}^{(\\mathrm{sym})} = \\frac{1}{6} [1(3)(1) + 2(0)(1) + 3(1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+0-3) = 0$.\n- $m_{E}^{(\\mathrm{sym})} = \\frac{1}{6} [1(3)(2) + 2(0)(-1) + 3(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}(6+0+0) = 1$.\nThe decomposition is $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E) = A_{1} \\oplus E$.\n\nReduction of $\\wedge^{2}(E)$ with $\\chi_{\\wedge^{2}(E)} = (1, 1, -1)$:\nBy inspection, the character vector $(1, 1, -1)$ is identical to the character vector of the irreducible representation $A_{2}$. Therefore, $\\wedge^{2}(E) = A_{2}$. Formally calculating the multiplicities confirms this:\n- $m_{A_{1}}^{(\\mathrm{anti})} = \\frac{1}{6} [1(1)(1) + 2(1)(1) + 3(-1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(1+2-3) = 0$.\n- $m_{A_{2}}^{(\\mathrm{anti})} = \\frac{1}{6} [1(1)(1) + 2(1)(1) + 3(-1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(1+2+3) = 1$.\n- $m_{E}^{(\\mathrm{anti})} = \\frac{1}{6} [1(1)(2) + 2(1)(-1) + 3(-1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}(2-2+0) = 0$.\nThe decomposition is $\\wedge^{2}(E) = A_{2}$.\n\nThe required multiplicities are thus $(m_{A_{1}}^{(\\mathrm{sym})}, m_{A_{2}}^{(\\mathrm{sym})}, m_{E}^{(\\mathrm{sym})}, m_{A_{1}}^{(\\mathrm{anti})}, m_{A_{2}}^{(\\mathrm{anti})}, m_{E}^{(\\mathrm{anti})}) = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nFinally, we provide the physical interpretation. The representation $E$ has basis functions $(x,y)$. The symmetric square $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$ describes the transformation properties of quadratic forms built from this basis, namely $\\{x^{2}, y^{2}, xy\\}$. The dimension is $3$, consistent with $\\dim(\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E))=3$.\n- The $A_{1}$ component is totally symmetric. The quadratic form $x^{2}+y^{2}$ is invariant under all operations of $C_{3v}$ and thus provides a basis for the $A_{1}$ representation.\n- The $E$ component is two-dimensional. The remaining linearly independent quadratic forms can be taken as the pair $(x^{2}-y^{2}, xy)$ or, more conveniently, $(x^{2}-y^{2}, 2xy)$, which is known to transform as the $E$ representation in $C_{3v}$. Together, $\\{x^{2}+y^{2}\\}$ and $\\{x^{2}-y^{2}, xy\\}$ form a complete set of quadratic forms spanning $\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}(E)$.\n\nThe antisymmetric square $\\wedge^{2}(E)$ is found to be the $A_{2}$ representation. The problem notes that an axial vector in $C_{3v}$ transforms as $A_{2}$. The axial vector associated with the $C_{3v}$ point group is the rotation about the principal axis, $R_{z}$. Its transformation properties are:\n- Under $E$, $R_z$ is unchanged (character $+1$).\n- Under $C_{3}$, which is a rotation about the $z$-axis, $R_z$ is unchanged (character $+1$).\n- Under $\\sigma_{v}$, a reflection through a plane containing the $z$-axis, the sense of rotation is reversed, so $R_z \\to -R_z$ (character $-1$).\nThe character for $R_{z}$ is $(1, 1, -1)$, which is precisely the character of $A_{2}$. Thus, the physical quantity corresponding to $\\wedge^{2}(E)$ is the rotation $R_{z}$. This is consistent with the fact that the generator of rotations in the $xy$-plane, the angular momentum operator $L_z = xp_y - yp_x$, transforms as the antisymmetric product of the basis vectors $(x,y)$ and $(p_x, p_y)$, which both transform as $E$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2627661"}]}
