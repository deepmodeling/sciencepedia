The standard state convention requires $\\lim_{x_{2}\\to 1}\\gamma_{2}=1$, which is equivalent to $\\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0}\\gamma_{2}=1$. In terms of the logarithm, this condition is $\\ln \\gamma_{2}(x_1=0) = 0$.\nWe integrate from $x'_{1}=0$ to $x'_{1}=x_{1}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\ln \\gamma_{2}(x_{1})} d(\\ln \\gamma_{2}) = \\int_{0}^{x_{1}} \\left[ (2A-B)x'_{1} + 5B(x'_{1})^2 - 4B(x'_{1})^3 \\right] dx'_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(x_{1}) - \\ln \\gamma_{2}(0) = \\left[ (2A-B)\\frac{(x'_{1})^2}{2} + 5B\\frac{(x'_{1})^3}{3} - 4B\\frac{(x'_{1})^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{x_{1}}\n$$\nWith $\\ln \\gamma_{2}(0)=0$, we obtain the final analytical expression for $\\ln \\gamma_{2}(x_{1})$:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(x_{1}) = \\left(A - \\frac{B}{2}\\right)x_{1}^2 + \\frac{5B}{3}x_{1}^3 - Bx_{1}^4\n$$\nWe are asked to find the value of $\\ln \\gamma_{2}$ at $x_{1}=0.40$, given $A=0.80$ and $B=0.50$. We substitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(0.40) = \\left(0.80 - \\frac{0.50}{2}\\right)(0.40)^2 + \\frac{5(0.50)}{3}(0.40)^3 - (0.50)(0.40)^4\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(0.40) = (0.80 - 0.25)(0.16) + \\frac{2.5}{3}(0.064) - (0.50)(0.0256)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(0.40) = (0.55)(0.16) + \\frac{0.16}{3} - 0.0128\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(0.40) = 0.088 + 0.053333... - 0.0128\n$$\n$$\n\\ln \\gamma_{2}(0.40) = 0.141333... - 0.0128 = 0.1285333...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $0.1285$. This value is dimensionless.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1285}\n$$", "id": "2622647"}]}
