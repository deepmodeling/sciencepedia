We proceed by deriving the relationship between these conventions from first principles.\n\nThe condition for liquid-vapor phase equilibrium for any component $i$ is the equality of its chemical potential, or equivalently, its fugacity, in both phases:\n$$ f_i^\\ell (T, P, \\{x_j\\}) = f_i^v (T, P, \\{y_j\\}) $$\nwhere $f_i^\\ell$ and $f_i^v$ are the fugacities of component $i$ in the liquid and vapor phases, respectively, at temperature $T$ and total pressure $P$. The liquid composition is given by mole fractions $\\{x_j\\}$ and vapor by $\\{y_j\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that the vapor phase is ideal. For an ideal gas mixture, the fugacity of a component is equal to its partial pressure:\n$$ f_i^v = p_i = y_i P $$\nThus, for our solute $B$, the equilibrium condition becomes:\n$$ f_B^\\ell = p_B $$\nThe liquid-phase fugacity $f_B^\\ell$ can be expressed using different activity conventions and standard states. The activity $a_i$ is defined by $f_i^\\ell = a_i f_i^\\ominus$, where $f_i^\\ominus$ is the standard-state fugacity. The activity is related to mole fraction via an activity coefficient, $a_i = \\gamma_i x_i$.\n\nLet us analyze the two standard states given for the solute $B$.\n\n1.  **Raoult Standard State:**\n    The standard state is pure liquid $B$ at the system temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. The standard-state fugacity is $f_B^{\\ominus,R} = f_B^{\\text{pure liquid}}(T,P)$. The problem assumes the Poynting correction is negligible, so the fugacity of the pure liquid at pressure $P$ is approximately equal to its fugacity at its saturation vapor pressure, $p_B^\\ast(T)$. For an ideal vapor, this is simply $p_B^\\ast(T)$. Thus, we can write:\n    $$ f_B^{\\ominus,R} \\approx p_B^\\ast(T) $$\n    The liquid-phase fugacity of $B$ is then expressed as:\n    $$ f_B^\\ell = a_B \\cdot f_B^{\\ominus,R} = (\\gamma_B x_B) p_B^\\ast(T) $$\n    The Raoult-scale activity coefficient $\\gamma_B$ is defined by the limit: $\\gamma_B \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 1$.\n\n2.  **Henry Standard State:**\n    The standard state is a hypothetical state where the standard-state fugacity is the Henry's law constant for solute $B$ in solvent $A$ at the system $T$ and $P$.\n    $$ f_B^{\\ominus,H} = K_B(T,P;A) $$\n    The liquid-phase fugacity of $B$ is expressed as:\n    $$ f_B^\\ell = a_B^{(H)} \\cdot f_B^{\\ominus,H} = (\\gamma_B^{(H)} x_B) K_B(T,P;A) $$\n    The Henry-scale activity coefficient $\\gamma_B^{(H)}$ is defined by the limit: $\\gamma_B^{(H)} \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 0$.\n\n**Connecting the Standard States:**\nThe fugacity of component $B$ in the liquid, $f_B^\\ell$, is a physical property of the state of the system and does not depend on the convention used to describe it. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $f_B^\\ell$:\n$$ (\\gamma_B x_B) p_B^\\ast(T) = (\\gamma_B^{(H)} x_B) K_B(T,P;A) $$\nFor any non-zero concentration of $B$ ($x_B > 0$), we can divide by $x_B$:\n$$ \\gamma_B p_B^\\ast(T) = \\gamma_B^{(H)} K_B(T,P;A) $$\nThis equation provides the general relationship between the two activity coefficients. To find the relationship between the standard-state fugacities, $p_B^\\ast$ and $K_B$, we examine the limit of infinite dilution, $x_B \\to 0$:\n$$ \\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\left( \\gamma_B p_B^\\ast(T) \\right) = \\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\left( \\gamma_B^{(H)} K_B(T,P;A) \\right) $$\nBy their definitions:\n-   $\\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B = \\gamma_B^\\infty$, where $\\gamma_B^\\infty$ is the infinite-dilution activity coefficient on the Raoult scale.\n-   $\\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B^{(H)} = 1$.\nSubstituting these limits into the equation yields:\n$$ \\gamma_B^\\infty \\cdot p_B^\\ast(T) = 1 \\cdot K_B(T,P;A) $$\n$$ K_B(T,P;A) = \\gamma_B^\\infty p_B^\\ast(T) $$\nThis is the fundamental relationship connecting the Henry's constant to the Raoult's law framework. Now, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Option A:** In the Raoult standard state for $B$, $a_B = f_B^{\\ell} / f_B^\\ast$ with $f_B^\\ast$ the fugacity of pure liquid $B$ at the same $T,P$, and the Raoult-scale activity coefficient $\\gamma_B$ satisfies $\\gamma_B \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 1$. In the Henry standard state for $B$ in $A$, $a_B^{(H)} = f_B^{\\ell} / K_B$ with $K_B = K_B(T,P;A)$, and the Henry-scale activity coefficient satisfies $\\gamma_B^{(H)} \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 0$.\nThis statement is a precise and correct summary of the definitions of activity and activity coefficients for both the Raoult and Henry conventions as laid out in the problem statement and standard thermodynamic literature.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B:** For an ideal vapor phase and negligible Poynting correction, $K_B / p_B^\\ast = \\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B(x_B)$, the infinite-dilution limit of the Raoult-scale activity coefficient of $B$ in $A$. Therefore $K_B \\neq p_B^\\ast$ unless $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$, a condition that requires $B$ to behave Raoult-ideally in $A$ and that a pure liquid state of $B$ be meaningful under the same thermodynamic conditions.\nFrom our derivation, $K_B = \\gamma_B^\\infty p_B^\\ast(T)$. Rearranging gives $K_B / p_B^\\ast = \\gamma_B^\\infty$, which is precisely $\\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B(x_B)$. The first part is correct. Consequently, $K_B = p_B^\\ast$ if and only if $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. The condition $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$ describes a situation where the solute $B$ behaves ideally even at infinite dilution in solvent $A$. For an ideal solution that follows Raoult's law across all compositions, $\\gamma_B = 1$ for all $x_B$, so $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. The caveat that a pure liquid state of $B$ must be meaningful for $p_B^\\ast$ to be a well-defined physical property is also a necessary condition for the comparison.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C:** By construction, the Henry standard state is solvent independent; thus $K_B(T,P;A_1) = K_B(T,P;A_2)$ for any two solvents $A_1$ and $A_2$ at the same $T,P$.\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The notation $K_B(T,P;A)$ explicitly indicates a dependence on the solvent $A$. Our derived relation $K_B = \\gamma_B^\\infty p_B^\\ast$ confirms this. While $p_B^\\ast$ is a property of the pure solute $B$, the infinite-dilution activity coefficient, $\\gamma_B^\\infty$, is a measure of the interaction between solute molecules ($B$) and solvent molecules ($A$) at infinite dilution. These interactions are specific to the solute-solvent pair. Changing the solvent from $A_1$ to $A_2$ will, in general, change the value of $\\gamma_B^\\infty$, and therefore change the value of $K_B$. For example, the Henry's constant of oxygen in water is different from that in perfluorodecalin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:** When $B$ is sparingly soluble, the Raoult and Henry standard states become identical as $x_B \\to 0$, implying $K_B = p_B^\\ast$ generally in the infinite-dilution limit.\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, standard states are fixed reference points and do not depend on the composition of the mixture, so they cannot \"become identical\" as $x_B \\to 0$. The Raoult standard state is pure liquid $B$, while the Henry standard state is a hypothetical state. They are distinct concepts. Second, the implication that $K_B = p_B^\\ast$ is false. This would require $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. A solute being \"sparingly soluble\" is often a consequence of large positive deviations from Raoult's law, meaning the interactions between unlike molecules ($A-B$) are much less favorable than between like molecules ($A-A$ and $B-B$). This leads to a very large value for $\\gamma_B^\\infty$ ($\\gamma_B^\\infty \\gg 1$), and therefore $K_B \\gg p_B^\\ast$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E:** The reference chemical potentials for the Raoult and Henry standard states of $B$ are identical, that is, $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}(T,P) = \\mu_B^\\ast(T,P)$; they do not depend on the choice of solvent because both are defined at the same $T,P$.\nThe chemical potential of a standard state $\\mu_i^\\ominus$ is related to its fugacity $f_i^\\ominus$ by $\\mu_i^\\ominus = \\mu_i^{v,\\circ} + RT \\ln(f_i^\\ominus/P^\\circ)$, where $\\mu_i^{v,\\circ}$ and $P^\\circ$ are fixed. Thus, equality of standard-state chemical potentials implies equality of standard-state fugacities. The statement $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}(T,P) = \\mu_B^\\ast(T,P)$ (using $\\mu_B^\\ast$ for the Raoult state) is equivalent to saying $f_B^{\\ominus,H} = f_B^{\\ominus,R}$, which means $K_B = p_B^\\ast$. As established in our analysis of option B, this is only true in the special case where $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. In general, they are not equal. Furthermore, the Henry's law standard state chemical potential $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}$ depends on $K_B$, which is solvent-dependent. Therefore, $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}$ is solvent-dependent, contrary to the claim. The Raoult standard state chemical potential, $\\mu_B^\\ast(T,P)$, being that of the pure substance $B$, is indeed solvent-independent. The entire statement is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2645384"}, {"introduction": "Real-world chemical systems often contain multiple components that behave differently.

First, we must assess its validity. The problem provides a complete set of data: temperature $T$, liquid-phase mole fractions $x_i$ for three components, saturation pressures $P_i^{\\ast}$ for the two solvents, and the Henry's law constant $H_3$ for the dilute solute. The sum of the mole fractions is $x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 0.695 + 0.300 + 0.005 = 1.000$, which is consistent. The assumptions provided—ideal gas vapor phase, ideal solvent mixture (Lewis-Randall framework), ideal dilute solute (Henry's framework), and negligible Poynting correction—are standard and scientifically sound for such a calculation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium for each component $i$ is the equality of fugacity in the vapor phase ($f_{i}^{(v)}$) and the liquid phase ($f_{i}^{(l)}$):\n$$f_{i}^{(v)} = f_{i}^{(l)}$$\nThe problem stipulates that the vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas mixture. For an ideal gas mixture, the fugacity of component $i$ is equal to its partial pressure, which is given by Dalton's law as $y_i P$, where $y_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the vapor phase and $P$ is the total system pressure.\n$$f_{i}^{(v)} = y_{i} P$$\nThe expression for the fugacity in the liquid phase, $f_{i}^{(l)}$, depends on the choice of standard state for each component.\n\nFor the solvents (species $1$ and $2$), the problem states the liquid solution is ideal with respect to the Lewis–Randall (L-R) standard state. The L-R standard state is the pure liquid component at the system temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. The fugacity in the liquid for component $i$ is given by $f_{i}^{(l)} = \\gamma_{i} x_{i} f_{i}^{\\circ}$, where $\\gamma_{i}$ is the activity coefficient, $x_{i}$ is the liquid mole fraction, and $f_{i}^{\\circ}$ is the standard-state fugacity. For an ideal solution in the L-R framework, the activity coefficient is unity, so $\\gamma_{i} = 1$ for $i=1, 2$. The standard-state fugacity $f_{i}^{\\circ}$ is the fugacity of pure liquid $i$ at $(T, P)$. This is related to the fugacity at saturation, $f_i^{\\text{sat}}$, by the Poynting correction factor: $f_{i}^{\\circ} = f_i^{\\text{sat}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_i^{(l)}(P - P_i^{\\ast})}{RT}\\right)$. The problem states we can neglect the Poynting correction, so the exponential term is approximately $1$. The fugacity at saturation, $f_i^{\\text{sat}} = \\phi_i^{\\text{sat}} P_i^{\\ast}$, where $\\phi_i^{\\text{sat}}$ is the fugacity coefficient of the saturated vapor. For moderate pressures, we can assume the pure vapor is an ideal gas, so $\\phi_i^{\\text{sat}} \\approx 1$. Thus, the standard-state fugacity simplifies to the saturation pressure, $f_{i}^{\\circ} \\approx P_{i}^{\\ast}$. This formulation leads to Raoult's law.

This simplifies the equation to the Gibbs–Duhem relation for activity coefficients:\n$$x_1 d\\ln\\gamma_1 + x_2 d\\ln\\gamma_2 = 0$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the differential of $\\ln\\gamma_2$ in terms of the differential of $\\ln\\gamma_1$:\n$$d\\ln\\gamma_2 = -\\frac{x_1}{x_2} d\\ln\\gamma_1$$\nUsing the constraint $x_2 = 1 - x_1$, we can write this as a differential equation solely in terms of the composition variable $x_1$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln\\gamma_2)}{dx_1} = -\\frac{x_1}{1-x_1} \\frac{d(\\ln\\gamma_1)}{dx_1}$$\nThis demonstrates that if the functional form of $\\ln\\gamma_1(x_1)$ is known, the derivative of $\\ln\\gamma_2$ is fully determined. Integration then yields $\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1)$ up to an integration constant, thus completing the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given function $\\ln \\gamma_1(x_1) = A\\,(1 - x_1)^2 + B\\,(1 - x_1)^3$. First, we compute the derivative of $\\ln\\gamma_1$ with respect to $x_1$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln\\gamma_1)}{dx_1} = A \\cdot 2(1 - x_1)(-1) + B \\cdot 3(1 - x_1)^2(-1) = -2A(1 - x_1) - 3B(1 - x_1)^2$$\nSubstituting this derivative into the differential equation for $\\ln\\gamma_2$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln\\gamma_2)}{dx_1} = -\\frac{x_1}{1-x_1} \\left[-2A(1 - x_1) - 3B(1 - x_1)^2\\right]$$\nFactoring out common terms simplifies the expression:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln\\gamma_2)}{dx_1} = \\frac{x_1}{1-x_1} \\left[2A(1 - x_1) + 3B(1 - x_1)^2\\right] = x_1 \\left[2A + 3B(1-x_1)\\right]$$\nExpanding and collecting terms in powers of $x_1$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln\\gamma_2)}{dx_1} = 2Ax_1 + 3Bx_1 - 3Bx_1^2 = (2A + 3B)x_1 - 3Bx_1^2$$\nTo find $\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $x_1$:\n$$\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1) = \\int \\left[(2A + 3B)x_1 - 3Bx_1^2\\right] dx_1$$\n$$\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1) = (2A + 3B)\\frac{x_1^2}{2} - 3B\\frac{x_1^3}{3} + C$$\n$$\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1) = \\left(A + \\frac{3}{2}B\\right)x_1^2 - Bx_1^3 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\nFinally, we determine the value of $C$ by applying the boundary condition for the Raoult's law standard state for component $2$. This condition states that in the limit of pure component $2$, its activity coefficient must approach unity: $\\lim_{x_2 \\to 1} \\gamma_2 = 1$. This is equivalent to $\\lim_{x_2 \\to 1} \\ln\\gamma_2 = \\ln(1) = 0$. The limit $x_2 \\to 1$ corresponds to $x_1 \\to 0$. Applying this to our expression for $\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1)$:\n$$\\lim_{x_1 \\to 0} \\left[ \\left(A + \\frac{3}{2}B\\right)x_1^2 - Bx_1^3 + C \\right] = 0$$\nEvaluating the limit, we find:\n$$\\left(A + \\frac{3}{2}B\\right)(0)^2 - B(0)^3 + C = 0 \\implies C = 0$$\nThe integration constant is zero. Thus, the final expression for the activity coefficient of component $2$ as a function of $x_1$ is:\n$$\\ln\\gamma_2(x_1) = \\left(A + \\frac{3}{2}B\\right)x_1^2 - Bx_1^3$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(A + \\frac{3}{2}B\\right)x_1^2 - Bx_1^3}\n$$", "id": "2645409"}]}
