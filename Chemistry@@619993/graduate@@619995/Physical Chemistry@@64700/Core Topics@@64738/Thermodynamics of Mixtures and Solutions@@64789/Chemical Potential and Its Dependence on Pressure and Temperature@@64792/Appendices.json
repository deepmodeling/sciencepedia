The derivation must originate from first principles.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental thermodynamic identity for the Gibbs free energy, $G$, which is a function of its natural variables: pressure $p$, temperature $T$, and the number of moles $n$. For a closed, single-component system, the differential of the Gibbs free energy is given by:\n$$ dG = V dp - S dT + \\mu dn $$\nwhere $V$ is the volume, $S$ is the entropy, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu$ is defined as the partial molar Gibbs free energy:\n$$ \\mu = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n}\\right)_{T,p} $$\nFor a pure, single-component substance, the Gibbs free energy $G$ is a homogeneous function of first degree in the variable $n$. According to Euler's theorem for homogeneous functions, we can write $G(T, p, n) = n \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial n}\\right)_{T,p}$. This leads to the direct relationship for a pure substance:\n$$ G = n\\mu $$\nFrom this, the chemical potential is identical to the molar Gibbs free energy, $G_m$:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{G}{n} = G_m $$\nTo find how the chemical potential changes with temperature and pressure, we can derive the Gibbs-Duhem equation for a single-component system. We start by taking the total differential of the expression $G = n\\mu$:\n$$ dG = n d\\mu + \\mu dn $$\nEquating this with the fundamental identity for $dG$, we have:\n$$ n d\\mu + \\mu dn = V dp - S dT + \\mu dn $$\nThe term $\\mu dn$ cancels from both sides, yielding:\n$$ n d\\mu = V dp - S dT $$\nDividing by the number of moles, $n$, we obtain an expression for the differential of the chemical potential, which is an intensive property:\n$$ d\\mu = \\frac{V}{n} dp - \\frac{S}{n} dT $$\nThis can be written in terms of molar volume, $V_m = V/n$, and molar entropy, $S_m = S/n$:\n$$ d\\mu = V_m dp - S_m dT $$\nThis equation describes the dependence of the chemical potential on pressure and temperature for a pure substance.\n\nThe problem specifies that the process is isothermal, which means the temperature $T$ is constant. Therefore, the differential of temperature is zero, $dT = 0$. The expression for $d\\mu$ simplifies to:\n$$ (d\\mu)_T = V_m dp $$\nThis relation holds for any pure substance under isothermal conditions. The subscript $T$ indicates that temperature is held constant.\n\nNext, we must use the equation of state for an ideal gas, which is given as:\n$$ pV = nRT $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant. From this equation, we can express the molar volume, $V_m = V/n$, as:\n$$ V_m = \\frac{RT}{p} $$\nSubstituting this expression for the molar volume of an ideal gas into our equation for $(d\\mu)_T$:\n$$ (d\\mu)_T = \\left(\\frac{RT}{p}\\right) dp $$\nTo find the total change in chemical potential, $\\Delta \\mu$, as the system goes from an initial state $(T, p_1)$ to a final state $(T, p_2)$, we must integrate this differential expression.

Since the problem states that $p_1 > 0$ and $p_2 > 0$, we do not need to consider the absolute value.\n$$ \\Delta \\mu = RT \\left[ \\ln(p) \\right]_{p_1}^{p_2} $$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration gives:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu = RT (\\ln(p_2) - \\ln(p_1)) $$\nUsing the identity for logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we arrive at the final expression for the isothermal change in chemical potential:\n$$ \\Delta \\mu = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right) $$\nThis expression is derived entirely from first principles as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2628613"}, {"introduction": "Having established the principles for an ideal gas, we now extend our analysis to the condensed phase, where intermolecular interactions are dominant.
