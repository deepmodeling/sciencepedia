It is a standard, non-trivial exercise in the application of the definition of partial molar properties to a common thermodynamic model. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe partial molar excess volume of component $i$ is defined as\n$$\n\\bar{V}_i^{E} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{E}}{\\partial n_i}\\right)_{T,P,n_{j\\neq i}}\n$$\nWe are given $V_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{E} = n V_m^{E}(x)$, where $n = n_1 + n_2$ and $x = x_1 = n_1/n$. Direct differentiation of $V_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{E}$ with respect to $n_1$ and $n_2$ after substituting the mole numbers is possible but algebraically intensive. A more systematic approach is to first derive a general relation between a partial molar property $\\bar{Y}_i$ and the corresponding molar property $Y_m$.\n\nFor component $1$, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_1^{E} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial (n V_m^{E})}{\\partial n_1} \\right)_{n_2} = V_m^{E} \\left( \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial n_1} \\right)_{n_2} + n \\left( \\frac{\\partial V_m^{E}}{\\partial n_1} \\right)_{n_2}\n$$\nSince $n = n_1 + n_2$, we have $(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial n_1})_{n_2} = 1$. The derivative of $V_m^E$ with respect to $n_1$ is found using the chain rule, as $V_m^E$ is a function of $x$, which in turn is a function of $n_1$ and $n_2$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial V_m^{E}}{\\partial n_1} \\right)_{n_2} = \\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_1} \\right)_{n_2}\n$$\nThe derivative of the mole fraction $x = n_1/(n_1+n_2)$ is:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_1} \\right)_{n_2} = \\frac{(n_1+n_2)(1) - n_1(1)}{(n_1+n_2)^2} = \\frac{n_2}{(n_1+n_2)^2} = \\frac{n_2/n}{n} = \\frac{x_2}{n} = \\frac{1-x}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back, we obtain the expression for $\\bar{V}_1^{E}$:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_1^{E} = V_m^{E} + n \\left( \\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1-x}{n} \\right) = V_m^{E} + (1-x)\\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx}\n$$\nA symmetric derivation for component $2$ yields:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_2^{E} = V_m^{E} + (1-x_2)\\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx_2} = V_m^{E} - x \\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx}\n$$\nwhere we used $dx = -dx_2$. These relations satisfy the problem's requirement to start from the definition.\n\nNow we apply these general formulas to the given Redlich-Kister expansion. Let $V_m^{E}(x) = (x-x^2) G(x)$, where $G(x) = A_0 + A_1(2x-1) + A_2(2x-1)^2$.\nFirst, we find the derivative $\\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_m^{E}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\Big( (x-x^2)G(x) \\Big) = (1-2x) G(x) + (x-x^2) \\frac{dG}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{dG}{dx} = 2A_1 + 4A_2(2x-1)$.\n\nSubstitute this into the expression for $\\bar{V}_1^E$:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_1^{E} = (x-x^2)G(x) + (1-x)\\Big[ (1-2x)G(x) + (x-x^2)G'(x) \\Big]\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{V}_1^{E} = G(x) \\Big[ (x-x^2) + (1-x)(1-2x) \\Big] + (1-x)(x-x^2)G'(x)\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets simplifies: $x(1-x) + (1-x)(1-2x) = (1-x)(x+1-2x) = (1-x)^2$.\nThus,\n$$\n\\bar{V}_1^{E} = (1-x)^2 G(x) + x(1-x)^2 G'(x) = (1-x)^2 \\Big[ G(x) + x G'(x) \\Big]\n$$\nNow, we compute the term $G(x) + x G'(x)$:\n$$\nG(x) + x G'(x) = \\Big( A_0 + A_1(2x-1) + A_2(2x-1)^2 \\Big) + x \\Big( 2A_1 + 4A_2(2x-1) \\Big)\n$$\n$$\n= A_0 + A_1(2x-1+2x) + A_2(2x-1)( (2x-1)+4x )\n$$\n$$\n= A_0 + A_1(4x-1) + A_2(2x-1)(6x-1)\n$$\nTherefore, the partial molar excess volume for component $1$ is:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_1^{E}(x) = (1-x)^2 \\Big[ A_0 + A_1(4x-1) + A_2(2x-1)(6x-1) \\Big]\n$$\n\nFor component $2$, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_2^{E} = V_m^E - x \\frac{dV_m^E}{dx} = (x-x^2)G(x) - x\\Big[ (1-2x)G(x) + (x-x^2)G'(x) \\Big]\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{V}_2^{E} = G(x) \\Big[ (x-x^2) - x(1-2x) \\Big] - x(x-x^2)G'(x)\n$$\nThe term in square brackets simplifies: $x-x^2 - x+2x^2 = x^2$.\nThus,\n$$\n\\bar{V}_2^{E} = x^2 G(x) - x^2(1-x) G'(x) = x^2 \\Big[ G(x) - (1-x)G'(x) \\Big]\n$$\nNow, we compute the term $G(x) - (1-x)G'(x)$:\n$$\nG(x) - (1-x)G'(x) = \\Big( A_0 + A_1(2x-1) + A_2(2x-1)^2 \\Big) - (1-x) \\Big( 2A_1 + 4A_2(2x-1) \\Big)\n$$\n$$\n= A_0 + A_1(2x-1 - 2(1-x)) + A_2(2x-1)( (2x-1) - 4(1-x) )\n$$\n$$\n= A_0 + A_1(2x-1-2+2x) + A_2(2x-1)(2x-1-4+4x)\n$$\n$$\n= A_0 + A_1(4x-3) + A_2(2x-1)(6x-5)\n$$\nTherefore, the partial molar excess volume for component $2$ is:\n$$\n\\bar{V}_2^{E}(x) = x^2 \\Big[ A_0 + A_1(4x-3) + A_2(2x-1)(6x-5) \\Big]\n$$\n\nNext, we demonstrate consistency with the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The relation $x d\\bar{V}_1^{E} + (1-x) d\\bar{V}_2^{E} = 0$ is satisfied if and only if the molar property can be recovered from the partial molar properties via the summation rule $V_m^{E} = x\\bar{V}_1^{E} + (1-x)\\bar{V}_2^{E}$. Let us verify this:\n$$\nx\\bar{V}_1^{E} + (1-x)\\bar{V}_2^{E} = x(1-x)^2 [G(x) + xG'(x)] + (1-x)x^2 [G(x) - (1-x)G'(x)]\n$$\nFactor out the common term $x(1-x)$:\n$$\n= x(1-x) \\Big\\{ (1-x)[G(x) + xG'(x)] + x[G(x) - (1-x)G'(x)] \\Big\\}\n$$\n$$\n= x(1-x) \\Big\\{ G(x)(1-x) + x(1-x)G'(x) + xG(x) - x(1-x)G'(x) \\Big\\}\n$$\nThe terms involving $G'(x)$ cancel out:\n$$\n= x(1-x) \\Big\\{ G(x)(1-x+x) \\Big\\} = x(1-x)G(x) = V_m^{E}(x)\n$$\nThis confirms that the derived expressions for $\\bar{V}_1^{E}$ and $\\bar{V}_2^{E}$ are thermodynamically consistent and satisfy the Gibbs-Duhem relation.\n\nFinally, we analyze the composition limits.\nFor component $1$:\nAs $x \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\bar{V}_1^{E}(x) = (1-0)^2 \\Big[ A_0 + A_1(0-1) + A_2(0-1)(0-1) \\Big] = A_0 - A_1 + A_2\n$$\nThis limit is $\\bar{V}_1^{E, \\infty}$, the partial molar excess volume of component $1$ at infinite dilution in component $2$.

The central premise is the experimental observation that the total molar excess volume, $V^{E}(x_{1})$, is negative for all compositions $x_{1} \\in (0,1)$, where $x_1$ is the mole fraction of component $1$.\n\nThe fundamental relations governing molar and partial molar excess properties are essential for this analysis. For a binary mixture, the molar excess volume $V^{E}$ is related to the partial molar excess volumes, $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}$ and $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$, by:\n$$V^{E} = x_{1}\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} + x_{2}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$$\nwhere $x_{1}+x_{2}=1$.

The Gibbs–Duhem constraint for excess partial molar volumes at fixed $T$ and $P$ reads $x_{1}\\,d\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}+x_{2}\\,d\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}=0$.**\nThis statement represents the Gibbs-Duhem equation applied to partial molar excess volumes. The Gibbs-Duhem equation is a fundamental thermodynamic relation that holds for any set of partial molar quantities at constant temperature and pressure. It stems from the fact that the chemical potentials (and other partial molar properties) are not all independent. The derivation for excess properties is straightforward, as the reference state (ideal mixture) terms cancel out or are constant at fixed $T,P$. Thus, this statement is a correct and fundamental thermodynamic identity.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**II. If $V^{E}(x_{1})0$ for all $x_{1}\\in(0,1)$, then both $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}(x_{1})$ and $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}(x_{1})$ must be $0$ for all $x_{1}\\in(0,1)$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While $V^{E}$ is a weighted sum of $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}$ and $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$, it is not necessary for both terms to be negative for the sum to be negative. For example, consider the relation $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} = V^{E} + x_{2}\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}$. A function $V^{E}(x_{1})$ that is negative over the interval $(0,1)$ must start at $V^{E}(0)=0$, decrease to a minimum, and then increase back to $V^{E}(1)=0$. In the region where $V^{E}(x_{1})$ is increasing, its slope $\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}$ is positive. If this positive slope is sufficiently large, the term $x_{2}\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}$ can be positive and larger in magnitude than the negative $V^{E}$, making $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}$ positive. For a concrete counterexample, if at $x_{1}=0.8$, we have $V^{E}=-1 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{mol}$ and $\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}=+6 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{mol}$, then $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} = -1 + (1-0.8)(6) = +0.2 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{mol}$, which is positive.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**III. In the limit $x_{1}\\to 0$, one has $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}\\to 0$ and $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}\\to \\left.\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}\\right|_{x_{1}\\to 0}$.**\nThis statement concerns the limiting behavior of partial molar quantities at infinite dilution.\nAs $x_{1}\\to 0$, the mixture becomes pure component $2$. The excess volume of any pure component is zero by definition. The partial molar excess volume of a component in its pure state is also zero. Thus, $\\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} \\bar{V}_{2}^{E} = \\bar{V}_{2}^{E}(x_{2}=1) = 0$.\nFor the second part, we use the identity $\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}} = \\bar{V}_{1}^{E} - \\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$. Taking the limit as $x_{1} \\to 0$:\n$\\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} \\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}} = \\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} (\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} - \\bar{V}_{2}^{E}) = \\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} \\bar{V}_{1}^{E} - \\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} \\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$.\nSubstituting the result from the first part, $\\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} \\bar{V}_{2}^{E} = 0$, we get $\\left.\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}\\right|_{x_{1}=0} = \\lim_{x_{1}\\to 0} \\bar{V}_{1}^{E}$. Both parts of the statement are consequences of standard thermodynamic definitions and relations.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**IV. For any $x_{1}\\in(0,1)$, the composition derivative of the excess molar volume is $\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}=\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}-\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$.**\nThis is a standard identity in the thermodynamics of mixtures, which was derived in the preamble of this analysis. It follows directly from differentiating the expression $V^{E} = x_{1}\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} + (1-x_{1})\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$ with respect to $x_1$ and applying the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**V. If $V^{E}(x_{1})0$ for all $x_{1}\\in(0,1)$, then at each composition at least one of $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}$ or $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$ must be negative.**\nThis statement is a logical necessity. We have $V^{E} = x_{1}\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} + x_{2}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$. Given that $x_{1}>0$, $x_{2}>0$, and $V^{E}0$. Assume, for contradiction, that at some composition both $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} \\geq 0$ and $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E} \\geq 0$. It would follow that $x_{1}\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} \\geq 0$ and $x_{2}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E} \\geq 0$. The sum of two non-negative numbers cannot be negative: $V^{E} = x_{1}\\bar{V}_{1}^{E} + x_{2}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E} \\geq 0$. This contradicts the problem's premise that $V^{E}0$. Thus, the assumption is false, and at least one of the partial molar excess volumes must be negative.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**VI. If $V^{E}(x_{1})0$ for all $x_{1}\\in(0,1)$, then necessarily $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}0$ for all $x_{1}\\in(0,1)$.**\nThis statement makes two strong claims, both of which are false.\nFirst, the claim $\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}0$ (and $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}0$) for all compositions is equivalent to Statement II, which has already been proven incorrect.\nSecond, the claim $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$ for all compositions is equivalent to $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}-\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}0$. Using the identity from Statement IV, this means $\\dfrac{dV^{E}}{dx_{1}}0$ for all $x_1 \\in (0,1)$. This implies that $V^{E}(x_{1})$ is a strictly decreasing function. However, a function that starts at $V^{E}(0)=0$ and ends at $V^{E}(1)=0$ cannot be strictly decreasing over the whole interval. To return to zero, it must have a region where its slope is positive. Therefore, the inequality $\\bar{V}_{1}^{E}\\bar{V}_{2}^{E}$ cannot hold for all compositions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, statements I, III, IV, and V are valid conclusions from thermodynamic principles, while statements II and VI are incorrect generalizations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2658167"}, {"introduction": "Modern thermodynamic analysis is inseparable from computational methods.

Ensure the program is self-contained, uses the grid and formulas specified above, and requires no user input.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions or missing information. The task is a standard problem in chemical thermodynamics, requiring the derivation of expressions for activity coefficients from a model for the excess Gibbs free energy and subsequent numerical verification. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation and numerical implementation proceed as follows.\n\n### Derivation of Activity Coefficients from Molar Excess Gibbs Energy\n\nWe begin from fundamental thermodynamic definitions for a binary mixture at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.\n\n$1$. **Fundamental Relations**:\nLet $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the number of moles of components $1$ and $2$, respectively. The total moles are $n_T = n_1 + n_2$. The mole fractions are $x = x_1 = n_1/n_T$ and $1-x = x_2 = n_2/n_T$.\nThe total excess Gibbs free energy of the system is $G^E$. The molar excess Gibbs free energy is $G_m^E = G^E/n_T$. The problem provides the dimensionless molar excess Gibbs free energy $g(x) = G_m^E / (RT)$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant. Thus, the total excess Gibbs free energy is given by:\n$$\nG^E = n_T RT g(x) = (n_1 + n_2) RT g\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_1+n_2}\\right)\n$$\nThe excess chemical potential of component $i$, $\\mu_i^E$, is defined as the partial molar excess Gibbs energy:\n$$\n\\mu_i^E = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G^E}{\\partial n_i} \\right)_{T, P, n_{j\\neq i}}\n$$\nThe activity coefficient, $\\gamma_i$, is related to the excess chemical potential by the definition $\\mu_i^E = RT \\ln\\gamma_i$. Combining these definitions, we obtain an expression for the logarithm of the activity coefficient:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_i = \\frac{\\mu_i^E}{RT} = \\frac{1}{RT} \\left( \\frac{\\partial G^E}{\\partial n_i} \\right)_{T, P, n_{j\\neq i}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G^E$ in terms of $g(x)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_i = \\frac{1}{RT} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_i} \\left[ (n_1 + n_2) RT g(x) \\right] = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_i} \\left[ (n_1 + n_2) g(x) \\right]\n$$\n\n$2$. **Derivation for Component $1$**:\nWe compute $\\ln\\gamma_1$ by differentiating with respect to $n_1$ while holding $n_2$ constant. Using the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_1 = g(x) \\frac{\\partial(n_1+n_2)}{\\partial n_1} + (n_1+n_2) \\frac{\\partial g(x)}{\\partial n_1}\n$$\nThe first term is $g(x) \\cdot 1 = g(x)$. For the second term, we apply the chain rule, recognizing that $x$ is a function of $n_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g(x)}{\\partial n_1} = \\frac{dg}{dx} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_1}\n$$\nThe partial derivative of the mole fraction $x = n_1/(n_1+n_2)$ with respect to $n_1$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_1} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (n_1+n_2) - n_1 \\cdot 1}{(n_1+n_2)^2} = \\frac{n_2}{(n_1+n_2)^2} = \\frac{1}{n_T} \\frac{n_2}{n_T} = \\frac{1-x}{n_T}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\ln\\gamma_1$:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_1 = g(x) + n_T \\left( \\frac{dg}{dx} \\frac{1-x}{n_T} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for $\\ln\\gamma_1(x)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_1(x) = g(x) + (1-x)\\frac{dg}{dx}\n$$\n\n$3$. **Derivation for Component $2$**:\nThe derivation for $\\ln\\gamma_2$ is symmetric. We differentiate with respect to $n_2$ holding $n_1$ constant:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_2 = g(x) \\frac{\\partial(n_1+n_2)}{\\partial n_2} + (n_1+n_2) \\frac{\\partial g(x)}{\\partial n_2}\n$$\nThe first term is again $g(x)$. The second term requires the partial derivative of $x$ with respect to $n_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial n_2} = \\frac{0 \\cdot (n_1+n_2) - n_1 \\cdot 1}{(n_1+n_2)^2} = \\frac{-n_1}{(n_1+n_2)^2} = \\frac{-1}{n_T} \\frac{n_1}{n_T} = \\frac{-x}{n_T}\n$$\nSubstituting this result:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_2 = g(x) + n_T \\left( \\frac{dg}{dx} \\frac{-x}{n_T} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for $\\ln\\gamma_2(x)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\gamma_2(x) = g(x) - x\\frac{dg}{dx}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Stability and Boundary Conditions\n\nThe derived expressions do not involve numerical integration and are algebraically direct. They are inherently numerically stable as they avoid the indeterminate forms like $0/0$ that arise if one attempts to solve for $\\ln\\gamma_i$ from the relation $g(x) = x\\ln\\gamma_1 + (1-x)\\ln\\gamma_2$ at the composition endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\nThe Redlich-Kister form for $g(x)$ is $g(x) = x(1-x) S(x)$, where $S(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} A_k (2x-1)^k$. By construction, $g(0) = 0$ and $g(1) = 0$. The derivative is $g'(x) = (1-2x)S(x) + x(1-x)S'(x)$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are handled correctly and stably by these formulas:\n- At $x=0$, we have $g(0)=0$ and $g'(0) = S(0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} A_k (-1)^k$.\n  - $\\ln\\gamma_1(0) = g(0) + (1-0)g'(0) = S(0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} A_k (-1)^k$. This is the finite value for the infinite dilution activity coefficient logarithm of component $1$.\n  - $\\ln\\gamma_2(0) = g(0) - 0 \\cdot g'(0) = 0$. This correctly reflects that for pure component $2$, $\\gamma_2=1$.\n- At $x=1$, we have $g(1)=0$ and $g'(1) = -S(1) = -\\sum_{k=0}^{m} A_k$.\n  - $\\ln\\gamma_1(1) = g(1) + (1-1)g'(1) = 0$. This correctly reflects that for pure component $1$, $\\gamma_1=1$.\n  - $\\ln\\gamma_2(1) = g(1) - 1 \\cdot g'(1) = -g'(1) = S(1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{m} A_k$. This is the finite value for the infinite dilution activity coefficient logarithm of component $2$.\n\nSince the expressions evaluate to the correct, finite physical limits at the boundaries without any special handling, the formulation is numerically stable across the entire composition domain $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\n### Gibbs-Duhem Equation Verification\n\nThe Gibbs-Duhem equation for excess properties at constant $T,P$ provides a necessary consistency check:\n$$\nx \\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_1}{dx} + (1-x) \\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_2}{dx} = 0\n$$\nTo verify this, we differentiate our derived expressions for $\\ln\\gamma_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_1}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( g + (1-x)g' \\right) = g' - g' + (1-x)g'' = (1-x)g''(x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_2}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( g - xg' \\right) = g' - g' - xg'' = -xg''(x)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Gibbs-Duhem equation yields:\n$$\nx\\left( (1-x)g''(x) \\right) + (1-x)\\left( -xg''(x) \\right) = x(1-x)g''(x) - x(1-x)g''(x) = 0\n$$\nThe analytical expressions rigorously satisfy the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The numerical task is therefore a validation of the implementation and the accuracy of the finite difference scheme used to approximate the derivatives.\n\n### Numerical Implementation Plan\n\nThe calculation of the maximum absolute residual, $r$, proceeds as follows for each set of Redlich-Kister coefficients $A_k$:\n$1$. A uniform grid of $N=1001$ points $x_i$ is defined on the interval $[0,1]$.\n$2$. For each $x_i$ on the grid, the values of $g(x_i)$ and its derivative $g'(x_i)$ are computed from the Redlich-Kister polynomial.\n$3$. The values of $\\ln\\gamma_1(x_i)$ and $\\ln\\gamma_2(x_i)$ are computed using the stable formulas derived above.\n$4$. The derivatives $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln\\gamma_1(x_i)$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln\\gamma_2(x_i)$ are approximated using the specified second-order accurate finite difference formulas for the interior and endpoints.\n$5$. The Gibbs-Duhem residual $\\mathcal{R}(x_i) = x_i \\frac{d}{dx}\\ln\\gamma_1(x_i) + (1-x_i)\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln\\gamma_2(x_i)$ is computed for all grid points.\n$6$. The final result is the maximum absolute value of this residual over the entire grid, $r = \\max_i |\\mathcal{R}(x_i)|$.\nThe following program implements this procedure.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import polynomial\n\ndef calculate_max_residual(A: list[float]) - float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum absolute Gibbs-Duhem residual for a given set of RK coefficients.\n\n    Args:\n        A: A list of dimensionless Redlich-Kister coefficients [A_0, A_1, ...].\n\n    Returns:\n        The maximum absolute residual value over the composition grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
