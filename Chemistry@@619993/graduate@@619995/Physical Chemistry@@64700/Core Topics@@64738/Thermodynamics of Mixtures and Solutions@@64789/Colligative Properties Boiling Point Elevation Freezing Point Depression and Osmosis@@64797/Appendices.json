The large molar mass of antifreeze proteins amplifies their colligative effect, so at micromolar concentrations they can produce several kelvin of equilibrium freezing point depression through equilibrium thermodynamics alone.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. Colligative properties, such as freezing point depression, depend on the number concentration (molality or molarity) of solute particles, not on their individual mass or size. For a given *molar* concentration, the molar mass is irrelevant. For a given *mass* concentration, a larger molar mass implies fewer particles and thus a *weaker* colligative effect. Our calculation shows the effect is minuscule ($\\sim 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{K}$), not several kelvin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

This is due to the surface energy term, $\\Delta \\mu = 2\\gamma_{sl}v_m/r$.\n3.  \"depresses the local equilibrium temperature\": Correct. To maintain equilibrium at the interface, the higher chemical potential of the solid must be balanced by a lower temperature.\n4.  \"inversely proportional to the radius of curvature\": Correct. The Gibbs-Thomson equation shows $\\Delta T \\propto 1/r$.\nThe entire statement is a valid physical explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For fixed pin spacing, decreasing the solid–liquid interfacial free energy $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}$ decreases the magnitude of the kinetic freezing hysteresis, all else being equal.**\nThe formula for kinetic hysteresis is $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{hys}} \\approx (2 T_m v_m) / (r \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}) \\cdot \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}$. This shows that $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{hys}}$ is directly proportional to the solid-liquid interfacial free energy, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}$. Therefore, a decrease in $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sl}}$ will lead to a proportional decrease in $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{hys}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2630245"}]}
