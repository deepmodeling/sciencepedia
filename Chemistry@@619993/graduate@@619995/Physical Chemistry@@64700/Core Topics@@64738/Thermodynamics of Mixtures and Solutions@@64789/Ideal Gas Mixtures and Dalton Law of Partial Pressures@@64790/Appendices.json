Chamber 1 is filled with a pure, non-reactive gas, let's call it Gas X, until its pressure is $2.00$ atm. Simultaneously, Chamber 2 is filled with a mixture of gases. This mixture contains Gas X at a partial pressure of $1.00$ atm and an inert tracer gas, Gas Y, also at a partial pressure of $1.00$ atm.\n\nAt a specific moment, the valve between the two chambers is opened, allowing the gases to move freely between the chambers. Assuming both gases behave ideally, which of the following statements correctly describes the initial net direction of movement for each gas immediately after the valve is opened?\n\nA.

Diffusive motion of species $i$ at constant $T$ in an ideal gas mixture is driven by its chemical potential gradient, with $\\mu_{i} = \\mu_{i}^{\\circ}(T) + RT\\ln p_{i}$, so the initial net direction is from higher $p_{i}$ to lower $p_{i}$. Equivalently, at uniform $T$, the flux $J_{i}$ is proportional to $-\\nabla p_{i}$.\n\nInitial state:\n- Chamber 1: pure Gas X at total pressure $2.00$ atm, so $p_{X,1} = 2.00 \\text{ atm}$ and $p_{Y,1} = 0 \\text{ atm}$.\n- Chamber 2: Gas X at partial pressure $1.00$ atm and Gas Y at partial pressure $1.00$ atm, so $p_{X,2} = 1.00 \\text{ atm}$ and $p_{Y,2} = 1.00 \\text{ atm}$; total pressure $2.00$ atm.\n\nThus the total pressures satisfy $P_{\\text{total},1} = P_{\\text{total},2} = 2.00 \\text{ atm}$.

The physically correct final total pressure in the vessel is $4.89\\ \\mathrm{atm}$, obtained by applying the Ideal Gas Law to each component at the common $V$ and $T$ and adding their contributions at fixed $V$; the student’s method is conceptually invalid here because it uses pure-component saturated vapor pressures, which are properties relevant to condensed-phase equilibrium, not to a dry gas mixture.\nOur first-principles calculation yields a total pressure of $P_{total} \\approx 4.89\\ \\mathrm{atm}$, which matches the value provided. The described method, applying the Ideal Gas Law to each component in the final volume and summing the pressures, is precisely Dalton's Law, which is the correct approach. The critique of the student's method is also accurate: saturated vapor pressures are irrelevant in the absence of a condensed phase. This statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Because the mixture is ideal and nonreacting, the correct total pressure at fixed $T$ is the mole-fraction–weighted average of the pure-component saturated vapor pressures, so the student’s estimate is appropriate for this gas-phase mixture.\nThis statement endorses the student's incorrect method. As explained, Raoult's Law (the mole-fraction-weighted average of saturated vapor pressures) is not applicable here. The total pressure calculated by the student's method is $0.20\\ \\mathrm{atm} + 0.60\\ \\mathrm{atm} = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{atm}$, which starkly disagrees with the correct value of $4.89\\ \\mathrm{atm}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC.

Dalton's Law of additivity is a cornerstone of the ideal gas model and holds regardless of the relative molar amounts of the constituent gases, so long as they are ideal and non-reacting. The concept of \"suppression\" is characteristic of non-ideal interactions, which are explicitly excluded by the problem's premise of ideal gases. The total pressure is exactly the sum of the partial pressures derived from the Ideal Gas Law.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The saturated vapor pressure parameters $p_{i}^{\\ast}(T)$ enter only when a liquid solution is present and in equilibrium with its vapor (vapor–liquid equilibrium), and even then only under specific ideality conditions; with no condensed phase present, the appropriate gas-phase additivity relation is that the total pressure equals the sum of component pressures evaluated at the mixture volume and temperature.\nThis statement provides a correct and precise conceptual summary. The first part correctly identifies the context for using saturated vapor pressures: vapor-liquid equilibrium, typically for ideal solutions (Raoult's Law). The second part correctly states the principle for a simple gas mixture: Dalton's Law. This statement accurately explains why the student's method is wrong and what the correct physical law is.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. A more correct gas-phase additivity for this situation is Henry’s law applied to each component, because Henry’s constants replace the Ideal Gas Law in determining gas-phase partial pressures for nonreacting mixtures at fixed $T$ and $V$.\nThis statement is incorrect. Henry's Law, like Raoult's Law, describes vapor-liquid equilibrium, specifically for a dilute solute in a liquid solvent. It is irrelevant to a system composed solely of a gas phase. Furthermore, Henry's Law does not \"replace\" the Ideal Gas Law; the IGL describes the P-V-T behavior of the gas phase itself, while Henry's law concerns the equilibrium partitioning of a species between gas and liquid phases.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and D are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2933660"}, {"introduction": "The ideal gas laws provide a powerful foundation, but real-world applications often require us to account for intermolecular forces.

In the second virial framework, the deviation from volume additivity to leading order is governed by $y_A B_A + y_B B_B - B_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 2 y_A y_B\\big(\\tfrac{B_A + B_B}{2} - B_{AB}\\big)$. When the unlike interaction encoded in $B_{AB}$ equals the arithmetic mean of the like interactions $B_A$ and $B_B$, the mixture’s two-body nonideality is, to this order, indistinguishable from the linear average of the pure components, so the Amagat construction becomes exact to leading nonideal order. By contrast, Dalton’s law at common volume and temperature misses the cross contribution $2 y_A y_B B_{AB}\\,\\rho^2$ to the pressure that arises from unlike $A$–$B$ pairs; unless $B_{AB} = 0$, this cross term makes the sum of pure-component pressures differ from the true mixture pressure. For gases with similar sizes and interaction strengths (so that $B_{AB} \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}(B_A + B_B)$ but $B_{AB} \\neq 0$), this yields an explicit scenario where Amagat’s law approximately holds while Dalton’s law fails to the same order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02806}$$", "id": "2933694"}]}
