For an ideal solution, the chemical potential of each component $i$ in the mixture is related to the chemical potential of the pure component by the following fundamental relation:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^* + RT \\ln(x_i) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the mixture.\n\nSubstituting this relation into the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{mix}} = n_1 (RT \\ln x_1) + n_2 (RT \\ln x_2) $$\nTo obtain the molar Gibbs free energy of mixing, $\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}}$, we divide $\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}$ by the total number of moles, $n = n_1 + n_2$.\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}}}{n} = \\frac{n_1}{n} RT \\ln x_1 + \\frac{n_2}{n} RT \\ln x_2 $$\nRecognizing that the mole fraction is defined as $x_i = n_i / n$, we arrive at the general expression for the molar Gibbs free energy of mixing for an ideal binary solution:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} = RT (x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2) $$\nThis expression is a function of composition and temperature, as required.\n\nNow, we evaluate this quantity numerically using the provided data:\n-   Temperature, $T = 298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   Gas constant, $R = 8.314\\,462\\,618 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n-   Mole fraction of component $1$, $x_1 = 0.3$\n-   Mole fraction of component $2$, $x_2 = 1 - x_1 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} = (8.314\\,462\\,618 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298 \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times [0.3 \\ln(0.3) + 0.7 \\ln(0.7)] $$\nFirst, we compute the terms within the brackets:\n$$ \\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.20397 $$\n$$ \\ln(0.7) \\approx -0.35667 $$\n$$ 0.3 \\times (-1.20397) + 0.7 \\times (-0.35667) \\approx -0.36119 - 0.24967 = -0.61086 $$\nNow, we complete the calculation:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} \\approx (8.314\\,462\\,618 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298 \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times (-0.61086) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} \\approx (2477.71086 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (-0.61086) $$\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} \\approx -1513.56 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as instructed, gives $\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} \\approx -1514 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, we comment on the result. For any mixing process, the Gibbs free energy of mixing is related to the enthalpy and entropy of mixing by $\\Delta G_{\\text{mix}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{mix}} - T\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$. For an ideal solution, a defining characteristic is that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, $\\Delta H_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}} = 0$. This is because the intermolecular interactions between unlike molecules ($1-2$) are assumed to be identical to the average of the interactions between like molecules ($1-1$ and $2-2$). Consequently, for an ideal solution:\n$$ \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}} = -T \\Delta s_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}} $$\nThe molar entropy of mixing is given by $\\Delta s_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}} = -R(x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2)$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are fractions between $0$ and $1$, their logarithms are negative. The term $(x_1 \\ln x_1 + x_2 \\ln x_2)$ is therefore always negative for a mixture. This makes $\\Delta s_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}}$ always positive, reflecting the increase in randomness upon mixing. As a result, $\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}}$ must be negative for all compositions (except pure components where $x_i=1$) and positive temperatures, indicating that the mixing of ideal components is a spontaneous process. Our calculated value of $-1514 \\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ is negative, which is consistent with this fundamental principle.\n\nThe excess Gibbs free energy, $G^E$, is defined as the difference between the Gibbs free energy of mixing of a real solution and that of an ideal solution: $G^E = \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} - \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}}^{\\text{ideal}}$. Since the problem specifies the formation of an ideal solution, the excess Gibbs free energy is, by definition, zero: $G^E = 0$.

We may therefore proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe molar excess volume of mixing, denoted as $v^E$, is defined as the difference between the actual molar volume of the mixture, $v$, and the molar volume that the mixture would possess if it behaved as an ideal solution, $v^{id}$. The fundamental definition is:\n$$v^E = v - v^{id}$$\nTo determine $v^E$, we must calculate both $v$ and $v^{id}$ from the provided data.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the molar volume of an ideal mixture, $v^{id}$. For an ideal solution, the volumes of the pure components are additive on a molar basis. Therefore, the ideal molar volume is the mole-fraction-weighted average of the molar volumes of the pure components, $v_1^*$ and $v_2^*$.\n$$v^{id} = x_1 v_1^* + x_2 v_2^*$$\nSubstituting the given values for the mole fractions $x_1 = 0.600$ and $x_2 = 0.400$, and the pure-component molar volumes $v_1^{*} = 74.00\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ and $v_2^{*} = 80.20\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$:\n$$v^{id} = (0.600)(74.00\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) + (0.400)(80.20\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})$$\n$$v^{id} = 44.40\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} + 32.08\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 76.48\\ \\mathrm{cm}^3\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the actual molar volume of the real mixture, $v$.

A negative value for $v^E$, as found here, signifies a volume contraction upon mixing. This indicates that the volume of the mixture is smaller than the sum of the volumes of the pure components before mixing. Such a contraction occurs because the attractive forces between unlike molecules (acetone-chloroform) are stronger than the average of the attractive forces between like molecules (acetone-acetone and chloroform-chloroform). In this specific system, the electronegative chlorine atoms on chloroform make its single hydrogen atom unusually acidic. This allows for the formation of a relatively strong hydrogen bond between the chloroform hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of acetone.

The objective function to minimize is:\n$$ S(\\tau_{12}, \\tau_{21}) = \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{H_1}{p_1^{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) - \\left(\\tau_{21} + \\tau_{12} e^{-\\alpha\\tau_{12}}\\right) \\right]^2 + \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{H_2}{p_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}}\\right) - \\left(\\tau_{12} + \\tau_{21} e^{-\\alpha\\tau_{21}}\\right) \\right]^2 $$\nA numerical nonlinear least-squares solver is used to find the values of $(\\tau_{12}, \\tau_{21})$ that minimize $S$ for each of the given test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for NRTL binary interaction parameters tau12 and tau21 for three\n    test cases by fitting to limiting activity coefficients derived from\n    Henry's constants and saturation pressures.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite: (T, p1_sat, p2_sat, H1, H2, alpha)\n    # Pressures are in Pa, Temperature in K.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (general nonideal)\n        (298.15, 50000.0, 20000.0, 125000.0, 36000.0, 0.3),\n        # Case B (ideal boundary)\n        (298.15, 40000.0, 30000.0, 40000.0, 30000.0, 0.3),\n        # Case C (strong asymmetry)\n        (313.15, 8000.0, 3200.0, 48000.0, 3840.0, 0.47),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        _T, p1_sat, p2_sat, H1, H2, alpha = case\n        \n        # Calculate target values for the logarithm of limiting activity coefficients\n        # from experimental data.\n        # gamma_1_inf_exp = H1 / p1_sat\n        # gamma_2_inf_exp = H2 / p2_sat\n        log_gamma1_inf_exp = np.log(H1 / p1_sat)\n        log_gamma2_inf_exp = np.log(H2 / p2_sat)\n\n        def residual_function(tau):\n            \"\"\"\n            Calculates the residuals between the model-predicted log activity\n            coefficients and the target experimental values.\n            \n            Args:\n                tau (list or np.ndarray): A list containing [tau12, tau21].\n            \n            Returns:\n                list: A list of two residuals.\n            \"\"\"\n            tau12, tau21 = tau\n            \n            # Model prediction for log(gamma_1_inf) using the derived expression:\n            # ln(gamma_1^inf) = tau_21 + tau_12 * exp(-alpha * tau_12)\n            log_gamma1_inf_model = tau21 + tau12 * np.exp(-alpha * tau12)\n            \n            # Model prediction for log(gamma_2_inf) using the derived expression:\n            # ln(gamma_2^inf) = tau_12 + tau_21 * exp(-alpha * tau_21)\n            log_gamma2_inf_model = tau12 + tau21 * np.exp(-alpha * tau21)\n            \n            # Calculate residuals\n            res1 = log_gamma1_inf_model - log_gamma1_inf_exp\n            res2 = log_gamma2_inf_model - log_gamma2_inf_exp\n            \n            return [res1, res2]\n\n        # Initial guess for the parameters [tau12, tau21].\n        # A zero guess is a good starting point, corresponding to an ideal solution.\n        tau_initial_guess = [0.0, 0.0]\n\n        # Use scipy's least_squares solver to find the optimal tau values\n        # by minimizing the sum of squares of the residuals.\n        solution = least_squares(residual_function, tau_initial_guess)\n        \n        # The optimal parameters are in the 'x' attribute of the result object.\n        tau12_fit, tau21_fit = solution.x\n        \n        # Append the regressed parameters to the results list.\n        all_results.extend([tau12_fit, tau21_fit])\n\n    # Format the final output string as specified: a single line with\n    # comma-separated values rounded to six decimal places, enclosed in brackets.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in all_results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2651323"}]}
