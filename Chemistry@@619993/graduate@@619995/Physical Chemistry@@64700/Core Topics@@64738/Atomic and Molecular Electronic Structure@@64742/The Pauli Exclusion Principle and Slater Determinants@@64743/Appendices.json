It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to proceed. The core of the problem lies in the definition of the spin-orbitals, where $\\chi_{1}(x)$ and $\\chi_{2}(x)$ are identical. This is not a flaw in the problem statement but is precisely the condition whose consequences must be examined. The problem is a standard, fundamental exercise to illustrate the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to compute the value of the wavefunction $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$. The wavefunction is defined as a Slater determinant:\n$$\n\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3!}}\n\\det(M)\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the matrix whose determinant is taken, with elements $M_{ij} = \\chi_{j}(x_i)$:\n$$\nM = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\chi_{1}(x_{1}) & \\chi_{2}(x_{1}) & \\chi_{3}(x_{1})\\\\\n\\chi_{1}(x_{2}) & \\chi_{2}(x_{2}) & \\chi_{3}(x_{2})\\\\\n\\chi_{1}(x_{3}) & \\chi_{2}(x_{3}) & \\chi_{3}(x_{3})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom the provided definitions, we observe that the first and second spin-orbitals are identical:\n$$\n\\chi_{1}(x) = \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\alpha(s) = \\chi_{2}(x)\n$$\nThis identity holds for any coordinate $x$. Consequently, the first column of the matrix $M$ is identical to its second column. A fundamental property of determinants in linear algebra states that if two columns (or rows) of a square matrix are identical, its determinant is zero. This is because subtracting one identical column from another results in a column of zeros, and the determinant of a matrix with a zero column is necessarily zero.\n\nTherefore, for the matrix $M$:\n$$\n\\det(M) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the wavefunction $\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$:\n$$\n\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3!}} \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThis result is valid for any choice of coordinates $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$. The wavefunction is identically zero throughout the entire configuration space.\n\nThe second task is to explain why this configuration is not physically allowable.\nThe physical interpretation of a wavefunction $\\Psi$ is given by the Born rule, which states that the probability density of finding the particles at coordinates $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ is proportional to $|\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})|^2$. For our result, the probability density is:\n$$\n|\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})|^2 = |0|^2 = 0\n$$\nThis means the probability of finding the three-electron system in any configuration is zero. The total probability of finding the particles somewhere in the configuration space is the integral of the probability density over all possible coordinates:\n$$\n\\int |\\Psi(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})|^2 dx_{1}dx_{2}dx_{3} = \\int 0 \\, dx_{1}dx_{2}dx_{3} = 0\n$$\nHowever, for a wavefunction to represent a physical state, it must be normalizable to unity. That is, the total probability of finding the particles must be $1$. Since our wavefunction yields a total probability of $0$, it cannot be normalized and thus does not describe any physical state. A system of particles must exist somewhere.\n\nThis result is a direct mathematical consequence of a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics: the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In the context of this problem, the electrons are identical fermions, and their quantum states are the spin-orbitals $\\chi_{i}(x)$.\n\nThe setup of the problem attempts to place two electrons into the identical spin-orbital state $\\chi_{1}(x) = \\chi_{2}(x) = \\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\alpha(s)$. The Slater determinant is constructed specifically to enforce the antisymmetry requirement for a multi-fermion wavefunction, which means the wavefunction must change its sign upon the exchange of the coordinates of any two fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle is a direct consequence of this antisymmetry requirement. If one attempts to construct an antisymmetric wavefunction from a set of single-particle states that are not all distinct, the resulting wavefunction is identically zero.\n\nIn essence, the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics forbids such a state from existing from the very outset, by making its wavefunction vanish.

This requires determining the sign of the permutation $\\sigma$ that maps the sequence of indices $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)$ to $(3, 1, 6, 2, 5, 4)$.\nThe permutation $\\sigma$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 6 & 2 & 5 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the sign, we decompose $\\sigma$ into disjoint cycles:\n$1 \\to 3 \\to 6 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 1$. This is a cycle of length $5$, written as $(1, 3, 6, 4, 2)$.\nThe element $5$ is a fixed point, forming a cycle of length $1$, written as $(5)$.\nSo, $\\sigma = (1, 3, 6, 4, 2)(5)$. The sign of a permutation is the product of the signs of its disjoint cycles. The sign of a cycle of length $k$ is $(-1)^{k-1}$.\nFor the cycle $(1, 3, 6, 4, 2)$, $k=5$, so the sign is $(-1)^{5-1} = (-1)^{4} = +1$.\nFor the cycle $(5)$, $k=1$, so the sign is $(-1)^{1-1} = (-1)^{0} = +1$.\nThe sign of the permutation is $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma) = (+1) \\cdot (+1) = +1$.

We are restricted to a subspace of the total Hilbert space characterized by a fixed total spin projection $S_{z} = \\frac{1}{2}$.
