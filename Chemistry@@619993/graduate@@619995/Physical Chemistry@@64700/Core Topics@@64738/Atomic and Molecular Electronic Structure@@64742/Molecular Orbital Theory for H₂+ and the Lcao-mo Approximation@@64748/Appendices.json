It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained, representing a fundamental derivation in molecular orbital theory. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the symmetry-adapted molecular orbitals for the $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecular cation within the LCAO-MO approximation. We are given two equivalent nuclei, $A$ and $B$, with corresponding real, normalized atomic orbitals $\\chi_{A}$ and $\\chi_{B}$. The molecular orbitals, $\\psi$, must be eigenfunctions of the operator that exchanges the two nuclear centers.\n\n(a) Determination of Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combinations\n\nLet $\\hat{P}_{AB}$ be the operator that exchanges the spatial coordinates of nuclei $A$ and $B$. Since the nuclei are equivalent, the Hamiltonian is invariant under this operation. The action of this operator on the basis atomic orbitals is defined as $\\hat{P}_{AB}\\chi_{A} = \\chi_{B}$ and $\\hat{P}_{AB}\\chi_{B} = \\chi_{A}$. The molecular orbitals $\\psi$ are required to be eigenfunctions of $\\hat{P}_{AB}$, which means they must satisfy the eigenvalue equation $\\hat{P}_{AB}\\psi = \\lambda\\psi$.\n\nApplying the operator twice restores the original configuration, so $\\hat{P}_{AB}^2 = \\hat{I}$, where $\\hat{I}$ is the identity operator. Consequently, the eigenvalues must satisfy $\\lambda^2 = 1$, which yields $\\lambda = +1$ (symmetric) and $\\lambda = -1$ (antisymmetric).\n\nWe start with the general LCAO ansatz, $\\psi = c_{A}\\chi_{A} + c_{B}\\chi_{B}$. Applying the exchange operator gives:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{AB}\\psi = \\hat{P}_{AB}(c_{A}\\chi_{A} + c_{B}\\chi_{B}) = c_{A}(\\hat{P}_{AB}\\chi_{A}) + c_{B}(\\hat{P}_{AB}\\chi_{B}) = c_{A}\\chi_{B} + c_{B}\\chi_{A}\n$$\nNow we enforce the eigenfunction condition, $\\hat{P}_{AB}\\psi = \\lambda\\psi$:\n$$\nc_{A}\\chi_{B} + c_{B}\\chi_{A} = \\lambda(c_{A}\\chi_{A} + c_{B}\\chi_{B})\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n(c_{B} - \\lambda c_{A})\\chi_{A} + (c_{A} - \\lambda c_{B})\\chi_{B} = 0\n$$\nSince the atomic orbitals $\\chi_{A}$ and $\\chi_{B}$ are linearly independent (because the overlap integral $|S| < 1$), their coefficients must independently be zero. This gives two equations:\n$c_{B} - \\lambda c_{A} = 0 \\implies c_{B} = \\lambda c_{A}$\n$c_{A} - \\lambda c_{B} = 0 \\implies c_{A} = \\lambda c_{B}$\n\nThese two equations are consistent, yielding the relationship $c_{B} = \\pm c_{A}$. This leads to two distinct types of molecular orbitals based on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\nCase 1: Symmetric combination ($\\lambda = +1$)\nFor $\\lambda = +1$, we have $c_{B} = c_{A}$. The resulting molecular orbital, which we denote $\\psi_{+}$, has the form $\\psi_{+} = c_{A}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B})$. We can absorb the coefficient $c_A$ into a general normalization constant $N_{+}$, yielding the symmetry-adapted form:\n$$\n\\psi_{+} = N_{+}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B})\n$$\n\nCase 2: Antisymmetric combination ($\\lambda = -1$)\nFor $\\lambda = -1$, we have $c_{B} = -c_{A}$. The resulting molecular orbital, denoted $\\psi_{-}$, has the form $\\psi_{-} = c_{A}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B})$. Again, we absorb $c_A$ into a normalization constant $N_{-}$:\n$$\n\\psi_{-} = N_{-}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B})\n$$\nThese are the required symmetry-adapted linear combinations.\n\n(b, c) Determination and Verification of Normalization Coefficients\n\nTo determine the real normalization coefficients $N_{+}$ and $N_{-}$, we must impose the normalization condition $\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = 1$ for each molecular orbital. This process also serves as the explicit verification requested in part (c).\n\nFor the bonding molecular orbital $\\psi_{+}$:\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle \\psi_{+} | \\psi_{+} \\rangle = 1$. Substituting the expression for $\\psi_{+}$:\n$$\n\\langle N_{+}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B}) | N_{+}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B}) \\rangle = 1\n$$\nSince $N_{+}$ is a real constant, we have $N_{+}^2 \\langle \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} \\rangle = 1$.\nWe expand the inner product using its linearity:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{A} \\rangle + \\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle + \\langle \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} \\rangle + \\langle \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle\n$$\nWe are given that the atomic orbitals are normalized, so $\\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{A} \\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle = 1$. The overlap integral is defined as $S = \\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle$. Since the orbitals are real, the inner product is symmetric, so $\\langle \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle = S$. Substituting these values:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B} \\rangle = 1 + S + S + 1 = 2 + 2S = 2(1+S)\n$$\nThe normalization equation becomes $N_{+}^2 [2(1+S)] = 1$. Solving for $N_{+}$:\n$$\nN_{+}^2 = \\frac{1}{2(1+S)} \\implies N_{+} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S)}}\n$$\nWe choose the positive real root by convention.\n\nFor the antibonding molecular orbital $\\psi_{-}$:\nThe normalization condition is $\\langle \\psi_{-} | \\psi_{-} \\rangle = 1$. Substituting the expression for $\\psi_{-}$:\n$$\n\\langle N_{-}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B}) | N_{-}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B}) \\rangle = 1\n$$\nThis gives $N_{-}^2 \\langle \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} \\rangle = 1$.\nExpanding the inner product:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{A} \\rangle - \\langle \\chi_{A} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle - \\langle \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} \\rangle + \\langle \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{B} \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\langle \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} | \\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B} \\rangle = 1 - S - S + 1 = 2 - 2S = 2(1-S)\n$$\nThe normalization equation becomes $N_{-}^2 [2(1-S)] = 1$. Solving for $N_{-}$:\n$$\nN_{-}^2 = \\frac{1}{2(1-S)} \\implies N_{-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S)}}\n$$\nThus, the properly normalized bonding ($\\psi_{+}$) and antibonding ($\\psi_{-}$) molecular orbitals are:\n$$\n\\psi_{+} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S)}}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B})\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_{-} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S)}}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B})\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1+S)}}(\\chi_{A} + \\chi_{B}) & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(1-S)}}(\\chi_{A} - \\chi_{B})\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2652417"}, {"introduction": "With the analytical form of the molecular orbitals established, the next essential task is to calculate the system's energy.

This final practice moves from quantitative calculation to qualitative interpretation, challenging you to explain why the antibonding state of $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is repulsive. You will synthesize your understanding of wavefunction nodal structure, the physical meaning of the Hamiltonian matrix elements, and the inherent limitations of a minimal basis set to construct a complete physical argument for the absence of an antibonding potential well [@problem_id:2652405].", "problem": "Consider the one-electron diatomic cation $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$ within the clamped-nuclei Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a minimal-basis Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals—Molecular Orbital (LCAO-MO) model that uses the two hydrogenic $1s$ functions $\\{\\phi_{A},\\phi_{B}\\}$ centered at nuclei $A$ and $B$, separated by distance $R$. Let $E_{+}(R)$ and $E_{-}(R)$ denote the variational electronic energies of the gerade (bonding) and ungerade (antibonding) symmetry-adapted combinations, respectively, obtained by minimizing the Rayleigh quotient over the two-dimensional nonorthogonal space spanned by $\\{\\phi_{A},\\phi_{B}\\}$. The observable potential energy curves are the electronic energies plus the nuclear repulsion $E_{\\pm}(R)+1/R$.\n\nStarting from the variational principle, symmetry, and the definitions of the overlap $S(R)=\\langle \\phi_{A}|\\phi_{B}\\rangle$, Coulomb integral $H_{AA}(R)=\\langle \\phi_{A}|\\hat{H}_{e}|\\phi_{A}\\rangle$ (which includes the electron’s interaction with both nuclei at separation $R$), and resonance integral $H_{AB}(R)=\\langle \\phi_{A}|\\hat{H}_{e}|\\phi_{B}\\rangle$, reason through the $R$-dependence of $E_{-}(R)$ without invoking any pre-derived closed-form energy expressions. In particular:\n\n- Use the nodal structure of the antibonding molecular orbital, the signs and qualitative $R$-dependence of $S(R)$ and $H_{AB}(R)$ for $1s$ orbitals, and the variational structure of the generalized $2\\times 2$ problem to argue whether the antibonding potential $E_{-}(R)+1/R$ can possess a bound minimum at any finite $R$.\n- Discuss the limiting behaviors as $R\\to\\infty$ and as $R\\to 0$ (the united-atom limit), including how the antibonding state should correlate at $R\\to 0$.\n- Some minimal-basis computations display an apparent very shallow extremum of $E_{-}(R)+1/R$ at short $R$. Identify the physical origin (or lack thereof) of such a feature within the minimal-basis description.\n\nWhich of the following statements best captures the correct conclusions?\n\nA. The antibonding curve has no bound minimum because the ungerade molecular orbital has a node between the nuclei, depleting electron density in the internuclear region so that electron–nuclear attraction cannot compensate the increasing nuclear repulsion. In the minimal-basis variational problem for $1s$ functions, $H_{AB}(R)<0$ and $S(R)>0$ increase in magnitude as $R$ decreases, driving the antibonding electronic energy upward as $R$ decreases; adding $1/R$ increases the repulsion further, so no minimum can occur. Any shallow extremum at small $R$ in a minimal-basis calculation is an artifact of basis-set incompleteness near the united-atom limit: the antibonding state correlates to the united-atom $2p_{\\sigma}$ state, which cannot be represented by two $1s$ functions; as $S(R)\\to 1$ the nonorthogonality and forced orthogonality to the bonding state induce spurious features that vanish when $p$-type functions are included.\n\nB. The antibonding curve exhibits a true bound minimum because exchange stabilization overcomes nuclear repulsion at small $R$; the observed shallow extremum is a real metastable well that becomes deeper as a larger basis is used.\n\nC. The antibonding curve lacks a minimum because $H_{AB}(R)$ changes sign and becomes positive at small $R$, making the antibonding combination collapse into the bonding state; the shallow extremum reflects the sign change of $H_{AB}(R)$.\n\nD. The antibonding curve would have a minimum in the adiabatic BO picture, but the BO separation fails at small $R$ due to strong electron–nuclear coupling, washing out the minimum; the shallow extremum is caused by nonadiabatic coupling to the bonding state.\n\nE. The absence of a minimum is due solely to the nuclear repulsion term $1/R$; in a complete electronic basis the antibonding electronic energy $E_{-}(R)$ is attractive at all $R$, and the shallow extremum is a genuine short-range core–core attraction.", "solution": "The problem statement presented is a standard, well-posed exercise in introductory quantum chemistry. It requests a qualitative analysis of the potential energy curve for the first excited electronic state (ungerade, or antibonding) of the hydrogen molecular ion, $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and a minimal-basis LCAO-MO framework. All definitions and constraints are standard and scientifically sound. The problem is free of factual errors, contradictions, or ambiguities. It requires reasoning from first principles rather than rote memorization of formulas, which is a valid pedagogical objective.\n\nTherefore, the problem is valid and we shall proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe electronic wavefunction for the molecular orbitals (MOs) is approximated as a linear combination of the atomic orbitals (AOs) $\\{\\phi_{A}, \\phi_{B}\\}$, which are hydrogenic $1s$ functions. Due to the $D_{\\infty h}$ symmetry of the homonuclear diatomic molecule, the resulting MOs must be either symmetric (gerade, $g$) or antisymmetric (ungerade, $u$) with respect to inversion through the center of the molecule. The two MOs are:\n$$\n\\psi_{+} = \\mathcal{N}_{+} (\\phi_{A} + \\phi_{B}) \\quad (\\text{gerade, bonding})\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_{-} = \\mathcal{N}_{-} (\\phi_{A} - \\phi_{B}) \\quad (\\text{ungerade, antibonding})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}_{\\pm}$ are normalization constants. The problem asks for an analysis of the ungerade state, $\\psi_{-}$, and its associated total potential energy, $E_{-}(R) + 1/R$.\n\nThe variational principle states that the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{e}$, for any trial wavefunction is an upper bound to the true ground-state electronic energy. For states of a given symmetry, the principle extends to the lowest-energy state of that symmetry. Here, the energies $E_{\\pm}(R)$ are found by minimizing the Rayleigh quotient, which for this $2 \\times 2$ problem is equivalent to solving the generalized secular equation:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nH_{AA} - E & H_{AB} - ES \\\\\nH_{BA} - ES & H_{BB} - E\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nwhere $H_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_{i} | \\hat{H}_{e} | \\phi_{j} \\rangle$ and $S = \\langle \\phi_{A} | \\phi_{B} \\rangle$. For $\\mathrm{H}_2^+$, $H_{AA} = H_{BB}$ and $H_{AB} = H_{BA}$. The solutions for the electronic energy are $E_{\\pm}(R) = \\frac{H_{AA}(R) \\pm H_{AB}(R)}{1 \\pm S(R)}$. The ungerade state corresponds to the energy $E_{-}(R) = \\frac{H_{AA}(R) - H_{AB}(R)}{1 - S(R)}$. Although the problem directs us to avoid using this formula directly, it serves as a mathematical confirmation of our qualitative reasoning.\n\nLet us analyze the system as requested, without the final formula.\n\n1.  **Nodal Structure and Physical Consequences**: The ungerade wavefunction $\\psi_{-} = \\mathcal{N}_{-}(\\phi_{A} - \\phi_{B})$ possesses a nodal plane midway between the two nuclei A and B, where $\\phi_{A}(r) = \\phi_{B}(r)$ and thus $\\psi_{-} = 0$. The probability density, $|\\psi_{-}|^{2}$, is zero on this plane. This means the electron in the antibonding state has a very low probability of being found in the internuclear region. Instead, the electron density is pushed to the regions outside the two nuclei. The electron, therefore, cannot effectively screen the mutual repulsion of the two positively charged nuclei. In fact, by being predominantly outside the internuclear axis, the electronic charge pulls the nuclei *apart*, adding to the repulsion. Consequently, as the internuclear distance $R$ decreases from infinity, the total potential energy $E_{-}(R) + 1/R$ is expected to be monotonically repulsive. A stable bound state requires an energy minimum, which is not expected for such a repulsive interaction.\n\n2.  **Behavior of Integrals**:\n    *   The overlap integral $S(R) = \\langle \\phi_{A} | \\phi_{B} \\rangle$ involves the product of two positive-definite $1s$ functions. Thus, $S(R) > 0$ for all finite $R$. As $R$ decreases, the overlap increases, so $S(R)$ increases from $S(\\infty) = 0$ to $S(0) = 1$.\n    *   The resonance integral $H_{AB}(R) = \\langle \\phi_{A} | \\hat{H}_{e} | \\phi_{B} \\rangle$ is the key term responsible for chemical bonding (or antibonding). The electronic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{e} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{r_A} - \\frac{1}{r_B}$ contains the kinetic energy operator (positive expectation value) and the potential energy operator (negative expectation value). For orbitals on neighboring atoms, the potential energy term dominates, particularly the attraction of the overlap charge density $\\phi_{A}\\phi_{B}$ to the nuclei. This makes $H_{AB}(R)$ a negative quantity. As $R$ decreases, the magnitude $|H_{AB}(R)|$ increases.\n    *   Let's consider the energy expression $E_{-} = \\frac{H_{AA} - H_{AB}}{1 - S}$. Since $H_{AB} < 0$, the term $-H_{AB}$ is positive and destabilizing. As $R$ decreases, $|H_{AB}|$ increases, so $-H_{AB}$ becomes a larger positive number, driving the numerator to higher (less negative) energies. Simultaneously, the denominator $1 - S(R)$ decreases, approaching $0$ as $R \\to 0$. Both effects combine to make the electronic energy $E_{-}(R)$ increase sharply as $R$ decreases. Adding the explicitly repulsive nuclear term $1/R$ only reinforces this trend. Therefore, the total potential $E_{-}(R) + 1/R$ is purely repulsive and possesses no minimum at any finite, non-zero $R$.\n\n3.  **Limiting Behaviors**:\n    *   As $R \\to \\infty$, $S(R) \\to 0$ and $H_{AB}(R) \\to 0$. The Hamiltonian for one atom, say A, becomes that of an isolated hydrogen atom as the influence of nucleus B vanishes. Thus $H_{AA}(R) \\to E_{\\text{H}}(1s) = -0.5$ Hartree. The system correctly dissociates into a proton and a hydrogen atom: $E_{-}(\\infty) = E_{\\text{H}}(1s)$.\n    *   As $R \\to 0$, the system approaches the \"united atom,\" which is $\\text{He}^{+}$ with nuclear charge $Z=2$. The molecular orbitals must correlate to the atomic orbitals of $\\text{He}^{+}$. The gerade MO $\\psi_{+}$ correlates to the lowest energy state of $\\text{He}^{+}$, the $1s$ orbital. The ungerade MO $\\psi_{-}$, due to its nodal plane at the nucleus, must correlate to an atomic orbital with a node at the nucleus. The lowest-energy such state is a $p$-orbital. Specifically, it correlates to the $\\text{He}^{+}(2p_{\\sigma})$ state. The energy of this state is $$E_{\\text{He}^{+}}(2p) = -\\frac{Z^2}{2n^2} = -\\frac{2^2}{2 \\cdot 2^2} = -0.5 \\text{ Hartree}.$$\n    *   The total potential energy as $R \\to 0$ includes the nuclear repulsion, so $$\\lim_{R\\to 0} [E_{-}(R) + 1/R] = E_{\\text{He}^{+}}(2p) + \\lim_{R\\to 0} 1/R = -0.5 + \\infty = +\\infty.$$ This confirms the strong repulsion at small $R$.\n\n4.  **The Minimal-Basis Artifact**: The minimal basis of two $1s$ functions is fundamentally incapable of describing a $p$-type orbital. The wavefunction $\\mathcal{N}_{-}(\\phi_{A} - \\phi_{B})$ is an approximation to a $2p_{\\sigma}$ orbital, but it is a poor one, especially at small $R$. As $R \\to 0$, the basis functions become identical ($\\phi_A \\to \\phi_B$), and the basis set becomes linearly dependent ($S \\to 1$). The variational problem becomes ill-conditioned. The energy $E_{-}(R)$ calculated with this basis provides a very poor upper bound to the true energy. The inability of the basis to correctly represent the $2p_{\\sigma}$ united-atom wavefunction leads to unphysical behavior in the calculated energy curve, such as the spurious shallow extremum sometimes observed at small $R$. This is a classic example of a basis set incompleteness error. The feature vanishes upon inclusion of $p$-type functions in the basis set, which allow for a proper description of the united-atom limit.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A.** This statement asserts that the antibonding curve has no minimum due to the nodal structure depleting internuclear electron density, which is physically correct. It correctly describes the behavior of $H_{AB}(R)$ and $S(R)$ and their effect on the antibonding energy. Finally, it correctly identifies the shallow extremum as a basis-set incompleteness artifact arising from the inability of two $1s$ functions to represent the $2p_{\\sigma}$ united-atom state. This analysis is fully consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This statement claims a true bound minimum exists due to \"exchange stabilization,\" which is incorrect. The state is repulsive. It also incorrectly claims the artifactual minimum is real and deepens with a better basis set; the opposite is true, it disappears. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This statement claims the repulsion is due to $H_{AB}(R)$ changing sign to positive. This is factually wrong for the interaction of two $1s$ orbitals; $H_{AB}(R)$ is negative for all $R>0$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This statement incorrectly suggests that a minimum would exist in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation but is washed out by nonadiabatic effects. The potential is repulsive *within* the BO approximation. The artifact is due to basis set limitations, not a breakdown of the BO approximation itself. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** This statement incorrectly claims the electronic energy $E_{-}(R)$ is attractive at all $R$. The exact $E_{-}(R)$ curve is essentially flat, connecting the $-0.5$ Hartree energy at $R \\to \\infty$ to the $-0.5$ Hartree energy at $R \\to 0$. The LCAO model shows it rising steeply. In neither case is it \"attractive at all $R$.\" The repulsion comes from both the electronic energy behavior and the nuclear $1/R$ term combined. The claim about \"core-core attraction\" is also nonsensical for bare protons. **Incorrect**.\n\nThus, option A provides the only accurate and complete description of the phenomenon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2652405"}]}
