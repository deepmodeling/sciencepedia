The solution proceeds in three stages: first, constructing the manifold of all possible microstates consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle; second, decomposing this manifold into its constituent Russell-Saunders (LS) terms; and third, computing the required sum based on this decomposition.\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the Microstate Distribution**\n\nA $p$ electron is characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ and the spin angular momentum quantum number $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. The possible values for the magnetic orbital quantum number are $m_l \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and for the magnetic spin quantum number are $m_s \\in \\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. Consequently, a single $p$ subshell contains $2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ unique spin-orbitals, which can be denoted by the pair $(m_l, m_s)$.\n\nFor a $p^2$ configuration with two equivalent electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that the two electrons cannot occupy the same spin-orbital. Therefore, a valid microstate corresponds to a unique selection of two distinct spin-orbitals from the available six. The total number of such microstates is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\text{Number of microstates} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n$$\nEach microstate is characterized by the total magnetic orbital quantum number $M_L = m_{l,1} + m_{l,2}$ and the total magnetic spin quantum number $M_S = m_{s,1} + m_{s,2}$. We now enumerate all $15$ distinct pairs of spin-orbitals $\\{(m_{l,1}, m_{s,1}), (m_{l,2}, m_{s,2})\\}$ and calculate the corresponding $(M_L, M_S)$ values. Let's denote spin-up as $\\uparrow$ ($m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$) and spin-down as $\\downarrow$ ($m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}$).\n\n1.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+1=2, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (2, 0)$\n2.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (0\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (1, 1)$\n3.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (0\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n4.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (0, 1)$\n5.  $\\{(1\\uparrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n6.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (0\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n7.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (0\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (1, -1)$\n8.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n9.  $\\{(1\\downarrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (0, -1)$\n10. $\\{(0\\uparrow), (0\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0+0=0, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n11. $\\{(0\\uparrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (-1, 1)$\n12. $\\{(0\\uparrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n13. $\\{(0\\downarrow), (-1\\uparrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n14. $\\{(0\\downarrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (-1, -1)$\n15. $\\{(-1\\uparrow), (-1\\downarrow)\\} \\implies M_L=-1-1=-2, M_S=+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-2, 0)$\n\nAggregating these results yields the complete microstate distribution, typically presented in a table where rows correspond to $M_L$ values and columns to $M_S$ values. The numbers in the cells represent the count of microstates for each $(M_L, M_S)$ pair.\n\n| $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$ |\n| :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $2$   | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n| $1$   | $1$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n| $0$   | $1$ | $3$ | $1$ |\n| $-1$  | $1$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n| $-2$  | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\nThe sum of all entries is $1+1+2+1+1+3+1+1+2+1+1 = 15$, which confirms our enumeration is complete.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of LS Terms**\n\nWe identify the LS terms using the highest-weight method, which involves systematically accounting for all microstates. An LS term, denoted $^{2S+1}L$, corresponds to a block of $(2L+1)(2S+1)$ microstates.\n\n1.  The highest value of $M_L$ in the table is $M_L=2$. This microstate has $M_S=0$. The highest-weight microstate is thus $(M_L, M_S) = (2, 0)$. This must be part of a term with $L = M_{L, \\text{max}} = 2$ and $S=M_{S, \\text{max for this L}} = 0$. This defines the term $^1D$ ($L=2, S=0$). A $^1D$ term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (2(2)+1)(2(0)+1) = 5 \\times 1 = 5$ microstates. These have $M_S=0$ and $M_L \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. We subtract these $5$ microstates from our table.\n\n    Remaining microstates after removing the $^1D$ term:\n    | $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$ |\n    | :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|\n    | $1$   | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n    | $0$   | $1$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n    | $-1$  | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n\n2.  In the reduced table, the highest value of $M_L$ is $M_L=1$. For this $M_L$, the highest $M_S$ value is $M_S=1$. The new highest-weight microstate is $(M_L, M_S) = (1, 1)$. This implies a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$. This defines the term $^3P$ ($L=1, S=1$). A $^3P$ term accounts for $(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$ microstates. These correspond to all combinations of $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We subtract this $3 \\times 3$ block of microstates.\n\n    Remaining microstates after removing the $^3P$ term:\n    | $M_L \\setminus M_S$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $1$ |\n    | :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|\n    | $0$   | $0$ | $1$ | $0$ |\n\n3.  Finally, one microstate remains: $(M_L, M_S) = (0, 0)$. This must belong to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$. This defines the term $^1S$ ($L=0, S=0$). A $^1S$ term accounts for $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$ microstate, which is exactly what remains.\n\nThus, the $15$ microstates of the $p^2$ configuration are partitioned into three LS terms: $^1D$, $^3P$, and $^1S$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Sum $\\Sigma$**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $\\Sigma \\equiv \\sum_{\\text{all microstates}} L(L+1)$. Each microstate belonging to a specific LS term is an eigenstate of the squared total orbital angular momentum operator $\\hat{L}^2$ with eigenvalue $\\hbar^2 L(L+1)$. The value of $L(L+1)$ is constant for all microstates within a given term. Therefore, we can group the sum by the LS terms identified.\n\n-   For the $^1D$ term, $L=2$. There are $5$ microstates belonging to this term. The value of $L(L+1)$ is $2(2+1) = 6$. The total contribution from these microstates is $5 \\times 6 = 30$.\n-   For the $^3P$ term, $L=1$. There are $9$ microstates belonging to this term. The value of $L(L+1)$ is $1(1+1) = 2$. The total contribution from these microstates is $9 \\times 2 = 18$.\n-   For the $^1S$ term, $L=0$. There is $1$ microstate belonging to this term. The value of $L(L+1)$ is $0(0+1) = 0$. The total contribution from this microstate is $1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nThe total sum $\\Sigma$ is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\n\\Sigma = (5 \\times 6) + (9 \\times 2) + (1 \\times 0) = 30 + 18 + 0 = 48\n$$\n\nThe sum over all $15$ microstates of the eigenvalue of $\\hat{L}^2/\\hbar^2$ is $48$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{48}\n$$", "id": "2624402"}, {"introduction": "Once term symbols are identified, the next step is to understand their energy ordering, which is governed by spin-orbit coupling.

This configuration consists of a single electron in a $p$-orbital, for which the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$ and the spin quantum number is $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. For the atom, this gives total quantum numbers $L=1$ and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$, corresponding to the $^{2}P$ term.

Let the spin-orbit constant for this configuration be $A(p^1)$. We calculate the energy shifts for each level:\nFor $J=\\frac{3}{2}$ ($^{2}P_{3/2}$ level):\n$$\nE_{SO}(p^1, J=\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{A(p^1)}{2} \\left[ \\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}+1\\right) - 1(1+1) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) \\right] = \\frac{A(p^1)}{2} \\left[ \\frac{15}{4} - 2 - \\frac{3}{4} \\right] = \\frac{A(p^1)}{2} [3-2] = +\\frac{1}{2}A(p^1)\n$$\nFor $J=\\frac{1}{2}$ ($^{2}P_{1/2}$ level):\n$$\nE_{SO}(p^1, J=\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{A(p^1)}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) - 1(1+1) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) \\right] = \\frac{A(p^1)}{2} \\left[ \\frac{3}{4} - 2 - \\frac{3}{4} \\right] = \\frac{A(p^1)}{2} [-2] = -A(p^1)\n$$\nFor a subshell that is less than half-filled, such as $p^1$, the spin-orbit constant $A(p^1)$ is positive. Therefore, $E_{SO}(p^1, J=\\frac{1}{2}) < E_{SO}(p^1, J=\\frac{3}{2})$. The ground level is $^{2}P_{1/2}$, which conforms to Hund's third rule.\n\nNext, we consider the $p^5$ configuration, which has one hole in an otherwise filled $p^6$ subshell. A filled subshell is spherically symmetric and has $L_{closed}=0$, $S_{closed}=0$, and thus $J_{closed}=0$. The angular momentum operators for the $p^5$ configuration ($\\hat{L}_{p^5}$, $\\hat{S}_{p^5}$) and the single hole ($\\hat{L}_{hole}$, $\\hat{S}_{hole}$) are related by:\n$\\hat{L}_{p^5} + \\hat{L}_{hole} = \\hat{L}_{closed} = 0 \\implies \\hat{L}_{p^5} = -\\hat{L}_{hole}$\n$\\hat{S}_{p^5} + \\hat{S}_{hole} = \\hat{S}_{closed} = 0 \\implies \\hat{S}_{p^5} = -\\hat{S}_{hole}$\nA hole's quantum numbers are identical to those of the missing electron ($l=1, s=\\frac{1}{2}$), so the $p^5$ configuration also has $L=1, S=\\frac{1}{2}$, giving a $^{2}P$ term with the same $J$ values of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe spin-orbit operator for a configuration is the sum of one-electron operators, $\\sum_i a_i \\hat{l}_i \\cdot \\hat{s}_i$.

This implies $\\langle \\hat{H}_{SO}(p^5) \\rangle + \\langle \\hat{H}_{SO}(hole) \\rangle = \\langle \\hat{H}_{SO}(p^6) \\rangle = 0$. Thus, for corresponding states, the energy shifts are equal and opposite: $E_{SO}(p^5, J) = -E_{SO}(hole, J)$. Since the hole is equivalent to a single $p$ electron, $E_{SO}(hole, J)$ is formally identical to $E_{SO}(p^1, J)$. This leads to the conclusion that the effective spin-orbit constants must be negatives of each other: $A(p^5) = -A(p^1)$.\nSince $A(p^1)>0$, $A(p^5)$ is negative, leading to an inverted multiplet structure. The energy shifts for $p^5$ are:\n$$\nE_{SO}(p^5, J=\\frac{3}{2}) = -E_{SO}(p^1, J=\\frac{3}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2}A(p^1)\n$$\n$$\nE_{SO}(p^5, J=\\frac{1}{2}) = -E_{SO}(p^1, J=\\frac{1}{2}) = -(-A(p^1)) = +A(p^1)\n$$\nHere, $E_{SO}(p^5, J=\\frac{3}{2}) < E_{SO}(p^5, J=\\frac{1}{2})$.

Hund's First Rule: Maximize the total spin quantum number $S$.\n    The $d$ subshell ($l=2$) has $2l+1=5$ orbitals, corresponding to magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l} \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. To maximize $S = |\\sum_{i} m_{s,i}|$, we must place as many electrons as possible with parallel spins, without violating the Pauli exclusion principle. For a $d^{5}$ configuration, we can place one electron in each of the five distinct $d$ orbitals. By assigning the same spin magnetic quantum number, say $m_{s} = +1/2$, to each of the five electrons, we satisfy both the Pauli principle and Hund's first rule. The total spin projection is then $M_{S} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} m_{s,i} = 5 \\times (1/2) = 5/2$. The total spin quantum number $S$ is the maximum possible value of $M_{S}$, so we find $S=5/2$.

The total orbital angular momentum projection, $M_{L}$, is the sum of the individual $m_{l}$ values for these electrons: $M_{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} m_{l,i} = (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 = 0$. Since this is the only possible arrangement of $m_l$ values for the configuration that maximizes $S$, the maximum value of $M_{L}$ is $0$. Therefore, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L=0$. An electronic term with $L=0$ is designated by the letter $S$.\n\n    Combining these results, the ground term is a $^{6}S$ term.\n\n3.  Hund's Third Rule: Determine the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ for the ground level.\n    The possible values for $J$ are given by the vector coupling of $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, which yields $J$ values from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps. For our term, with $L=0$ and $S=5/2$, the only possible value for $J$ is $J = |0 - 5/2| = 5/2$. For a half-filled subshell, such as $d^{5}$, there is only one possible $J$ value for the ground term.

Substituting these values into the expression for the energy:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{SO}} = \\frac{A}{2} \\left[ \\frac{5}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+1\\right) - 0(0+1) - \\frac{5}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+1\\right) \\right]$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{SO}} = \\frac{A}{2} \\left[ \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{7}{2} - 0 - \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{7}{2} \\right] = \\frac{A}{2} \\left[ \\frac{35}{4} - \\frac{35}{4} \\right] = 0$$\nThe first-order spin-orbit correction is zero. Physically, spin-orbit coupling arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron's spin and the internal magnetic field created by its orbital motion relative to the nucleus. For an $S$ term ($L=0$), the total orbital angular momentum is zero. This corresponds to a spherically symmetric charge distribution with no net orbital motion, and thus no net internal magnetic field is generated. In the absence of this field, there is no potential for the spin magnetic moment to couple with, resulting in no first-order energy splitting. Any splitting of $S$ terms must arise from higher-order effects not considered here.\n\nFinally, we compute the Landé $g$-factor, $g_{J}$, for the $^{6}S_{5/2}$ level. The formula for the Landé $g$-factor in the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme is:\n$$g_{J} = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)}$$\nSubstituting the quantum numbers $J=5/2$, $S=5/2$, and $L=0$:\n$$g_{J} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}(\\frac{5}{2}+1) + \\frac{5}{2}(\\frac{5}{2}+1) - 0(0+1)}{2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{2}(\\frac{5}{2}+1)}$$\n$$g_{J} = 1 + \\frac{2 \\left[ \\frac{5}{2}(\\frac{7}{2}) \\right]}{2 \\left[ \\frac{5}{2}(\\frac{7}{2}) \\right]} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\nThe Landé $g$-factor is exactly $2$. This result is expected, as for any term with $L=0$, the total angular momentum $\\mathbf{J}$ is purely spin angular momentum ($\\mathbf{J}=\\mathbf{S}$). The associated magnetic moment is therefore purely due to spin, and the $g$-factor takes the value for a free electron, $g_{e} \\approx 2$ (approximated as exactly $2$ in this non-relativistic context).\n\nThe required values are the Landé factor $g_{J}=2$ and the spin-orbit energy correction $E_{\\mathrm{SO}}=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2624433"}]}
