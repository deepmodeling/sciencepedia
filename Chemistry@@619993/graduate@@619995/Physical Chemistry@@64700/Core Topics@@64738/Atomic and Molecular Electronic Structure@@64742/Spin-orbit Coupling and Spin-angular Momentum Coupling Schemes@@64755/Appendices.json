We will proceed with a systematic validation and subsequent solution.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem.\nThe givens are:\n1. The system is in the Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling regime.\n2. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L=1$.\n3. The total spin angular momentum quantum number is $S=1$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the well-established principles of quantum mechanics for angular momentum coupling. It is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($L=1$, $S=1$) to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not violate any physical laws or contain internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts, which we will address in sequence. The foundation of this analysis is the vector coupling of two angular momenta, $\\boldsymbol{L}$ and $\\boldsymbol{S}$, to form a total angular momentum $\\boldsymbol{J} = \\boldsymbol{L} + \\boldsymbol{S}$.\n\nPart 1: Determination of allowed values for the total angular momentum quantum number $J$.\nAccording to the quantum mechanical rules for the addition of angular momenta, if we couple two angular momenta with quantum numbers $j_1$ and $j_2$, the resulting total angular momentum quantum number $j$ can take on values in integer steps from $|j_1 - j_2|$ to $j_1 + j_2$.\nIn this problem, we have $L=1$ and $S=1$. Thus, the allowed values for the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ are given by:\n$$J \\in \\{|L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\dots, L+S\\}$$\nSubstituting the given values $L=1$ and $S=1$:\n$$J \\in \\{|1-1|, \\dots, 1+1\\}$$\n$$J \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$\nThus, the coupling of $L=1$ and $S=1$ gives rise to three spectroscopic terms, characterized by $J=0$, $J=1$, and $J=2$. These correspond to the term symbol ${}^{3}P$ splitting into three fine-structure levels: ${}^{3}P_0$, ${}^{3}P_1$, and ${}^{3}P_2$.\n\nPart 2: Counting states in the coupled basis, $|J, m_J\\rangle$.\nFor each value of the total angular momentum quantum number $J$, there are a set of allowed projections onto the quantization axis, given by the magnetic quantum number $m_J$. The values of $m_J$ range from $-J$ to $+J$ in integer steps. The number of such values, which is the degeneracy of the $J$ level, is given by $2J+1$.\nWe must sum these degeneracies for all allowed values of $J$ found in Part 1.\nFor $J=0$, the number of states is $2(0)+1 = 1$. ($m_J = 0$)\nFor $J=1$, the number of states is $2(1)+1 = 3$. ($m_J = -1, 0, +1$)\nFor $J=2$, the number of states is $2(2)+1 = 5$. ($m_J = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2$)\n\nThe total number of states in the coupled basis is the sum of the degeneracies of each $J$ level:\n$$N_{coupled} = \\sum_{J=|L-S|}^{L+S} (2J+1) = (2(0)+1) + (2(1)+1) + (2(2)+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9$$\nSo, there are a total of $9$ states in the coupled representation.\n\nPart 3: Counting states in the uncoupled basis, $|L, m_L, S, m_S\\rangle$, and comparison.\nIn the uncoupled basis, the states are specified by the quantum numbers $L$, $m_L$, $S$, and $m_S$. The total number of states is the product of the number of possible projections for the orbital angular momentum and the number of possible projections for the spin angular momentum.\nFor a given orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$, the number of possible projections $m_L$ is $2L+1$. For $L=1$, the number of projections is $2(1)+1 = 3$. The allowed values are $m_L \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$.\nFor a given spin angular momentum quantum number $S$, the number of possible projections $m_S$ is $2S+1$. For $S=1$, the number of projections is $2(1)+1 = 3$. The allowed values are $m_S \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$.\n\nThe total number of states in the uncoupled basis is the total number of unique combinations of $(m_L, m_S)$:\n$$N_{uncoupled} = (2L+1)(2S+1)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{uncoupled} = (2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$$\nSo, there are a total of $9$ states in the uncoupled representation.\n\nComparison:\nThe total number of states in the coupled basis, $N_{coupled} = 9$, is identical to the total number of states in the uncoupled basis, $N_{uncoupled} = 9$. This result is required by the principles of quantum mechanics. The transformation from the uncoupled basis $\\{|L, m_L, S, m_S\\rangle\\}$ to the coupled basis $\\{|J, m_J\\rangle\\}$ is a unitary transformation, which preserves the dimensionality of the vector space. The number of basis states must remain invariant. This confirms the correctness of our calculation. The total number of states is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "2668531"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract rules to physical reality, we now consider atoms with multiple, indistinguishable electrons. This practice introduces a critical constraint: the Pauli exclusion principle, which dictates that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric upon electron exchange and thus restricts the allowed combinations of orbital and spin states. By systematically constructing the microstates for a $p^2$ configuration, you will learn the essential technique for deriving the physically allowed spectroscopic terms, a core skill for interpreting atomic spectra. [@problem_id:2668526]", "problem": "An atom contains two equivalent electrons in a subshell with orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ (a $p$ subshell), so the electron configuration is $p^2$. In the Russell–Saunders (LS) coupling scheme, appropriate for light atoms where electrostatic interactions dominate over spin–orbit coupling, the total orbital angular momentum $\\boldsymbol{L}$ and the total spin angular momentum $\\boldsymbol{S}$ are formed by vector addition of the single-electron orbital angular momenta and spins, respectively.

The derivation must be founded on the Pauli exclusion principle and the rules of angular momentum coupling.\n\nAn electron in a $p$ subshell has orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ and spin quantum number $s=1/2$. The possible magnetic orbital quantum numbers are $m_l = -1, 0, +1$, and the possible magnetic spin quantum numbers are $m_s = -1/2, +1/2$. This gives a total of $2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ possible single-particle quantum states.\n\nThe configuration is $p^2$, meaning there are two equivalent electrons. Equivalence implies they have the same principal quantum number $n$ and the same orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Therefore, the two electrons must be distributed among the $6$ available single-particle states in such a way that each electron occupies a unique state. The total number of ways to place two indistinguishable electrons in $6$ distinct states is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{2}$, which is:\n$$ \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15 $$\nThis means there are exactly $15$ unique two-electron states, or microstates, for the $p^2$ configuration.

Spins can be parallel or antiparallel.\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item Parallel spins, $m_{s1}=m_{s2}=+1/2$, gives $M_S=1$.

A term defines a set of $(2S+1)(2L+1)$ microstates. We begin with the microstate corresponding to the maximum values of $M_L$ and $M_S$.\nThe maximum $M_L$ is $2$. This must belong to a term with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$. The only microstate with $M_L=2$ has $M_S=0$. The absence of microstates at $(M_L, M_S) = (2, \\pm 1)$ implies this term must have total spin $S=0$. Thus, we identify a term with $L=2$ and $S=0$, which is a ${}^{1}D$ term. A ${}^{1}D$ term has $(2S+1)=1$ and $(2L+1)=5$. It consists of $5$ microstates with $M_S=0$ and $M_L = 2, 1, 0, -1, -2$. We subtract these five microstates from our table.\nThe remaining microstates are:\n```\n      | M_S=-1 | M_S=0 | M_S=1\n------|--------|-------|-------\nM_L=1 |   1    |   1   |   1\nM_L=0 |   1    |   2   |   1\nM_L=-1|   1    |   1   |   1\n```\nIn this reduced table, the maximum $M_L$ is $1$, which occurs with a maximum $M_S$ of $1$. This combination $(M_L, M_S) = (1, 1)$ must correspond to a term with $L=1$ and $S=1$. This is a ${}^{3}P$ term. A ${}^{3}P$ term has $(2S+1)=3$ and $(2L+1)=3$, corresponding to $3 \\times 3 = 9$ microstates. These microstates span all combinations of $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. We remove one microstate for each of these nine $(M_L, M_S)$ combinations from the current table.\nThe remaining microstates are:\n```\n      | M_S=-1 | M_S=0 | M_S=1\n------|--------|-------|-------\nM_L=0 |   0    |   1   |   0\n```\nOnly a single microstate with $(M_L, M_S)=(0,0)$ remains. This must belong to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$, which is a ${}^{1}S$ term. A ${}^{1}S$ term consists of $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1)=1$ microstate. Subtracting this microstate leaves an empty table.\n\nThus, the allowed spectroscopic terms for the $p^2$ configuration are ${}^{1}S$, ${}^{3}P$, and ${}^{1}D$.\n\nNext, we find the allowed values for the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ for each term. $J$ is given by the Clebsch-Gordan series $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\ldots, L+S$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For the ${}^{1}S$ term: $L=0, S=0 \\implies J=0$. The level is ${}^{1}S_0$.\n    \\item For the ${}^{3}P$ term: $L=1, S=1 \\implies J=|1-1|, \\ldots, 1+1 \\implies J=0, 1, 2$. The levels are ${}^{3}P_0$, ${}^{3}P_1$, and ${}^{3}P_2$.\n    \\item For the ${}^{1}D$ term: $L=2, S=0 \\implies J=|2-0|, \\ldots, 2+0 \\implies J=2$. The level is ${}^{1}D_2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe complete set of allowed fine-structure levels, labeled by $J$, is $J=0$ (from ${}^{1}S_0$), $J=0, 1, 2$ (from the ${}^{3}P$ multiplet), and $J=2$ (from ${}^{1}D_2$).\n\nThe problem asks for the total degeneracy, which is the sum of the degeneracies of all allowed fine-structure levels. The degeneracy of a level with total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is $(2J+1)$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{\\text{all allowed }J}(2J+1)$.\n$$ \\sum (2J+1) = \\underbrace{(2(0)+1)}_{{}^{1}S_0} + \\underbrace{((2(0)+1) + (2(1)+1) + (2(2)+1))}_{{}^{3}P_{0,1,2}} + \\underbrace{(2(2)+1)}_{{}^{1}D_2} $$\n$$ \\sum (2J+1) = 1 + (1 + 3 + 5) + 5 $$\n$$ \\sum (2J+1) = 1 + 9 + 5 = 15 $$\nThis result is necessarily equal to the total number of microstates, $\\binom{6}{2}=15$, which confirms the correctness of our derivation.
