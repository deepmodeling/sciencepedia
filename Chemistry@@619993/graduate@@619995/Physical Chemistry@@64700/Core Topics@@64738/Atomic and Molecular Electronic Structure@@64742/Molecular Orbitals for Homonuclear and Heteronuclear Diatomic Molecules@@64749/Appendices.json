It is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds using the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals–Molecular Orbital (LCAO-MO) framework. The molecule under consideration is $\\mathrm{B}_2$. Each Boron atom has an atomic number $Z=5$ and a valence electron configuration of $2s^2 2p^1$, contributing $3$ valence electrons. The diatomic molecule $\\mathrm{B}_2$ therefore has a total of $6$ valence electrons to be placed in the molecular orbitals.\n\nThe problem specifies the energy ordering of the molecular orbitals for light homonuclear diatomics where $s$-$p$ mixing is significant:\n$$ \\sigma_{2s} < \\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast} < \\pi_{2p_x}=\\pi_{2p_y} < \\sigma_{2p_z} < \\pi_{2p_x}^{\\ast}=\\pi_{2p_y}^{\\ast} < \\sigma_{2p_z}^{\\ast} $$\nWe will fill the first few of these orbitals with the $6$ available valence electrons, following the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule.\n\n1.  The first $2$ electrons fill the lowest energy MO, the $\\sigma_{2s}$ bonding orbital, to give $(\\sigma_{2s})^2$.\n2.  The next $2$ electrons fill the $\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast}$ antibonding orbital, to give $(\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast})^2$.\n3.  We have used $4$ electrons. The remaining $2$ electrons must be placed in the next available orbitals. These are the degenerate $\\pi_{2p_x}$ and $\\pi_{2p_y}$ bonding orbitals.\n4.  According to Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity, when filling degenerate orbitals, electrons are placed singly in each orbital with parallel spins before any orbital is doubly occupied. Therefore, one electron occupies the $\\pi_{2p_x}$ orbital, and the second electron occupies the $\\pi_{2p_y}$ orbital. Their spins are parallel.\n\nThe resulting ground-state electron configuration for $\\mathrm{B}_2$ is:\n$$ (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast})^2 (\\pi_{2p_x})^1 (\\pi_{2p_y})^1 $$\nFrom this configuration, it is clear that there are two unpaired electrons, one in the $\\pi_{2p_x}$ orbital and one in the $\\pi_{2p_y}$ orbital. The number of unpaired electrons is $n=2$. The presence of unpaired electrons means that $\\mathrm{B}_2$ is paramagnetic.\n\nNext, we calculate the bond order. The bond order (BO) is defined as half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals ($N_b$) and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals ($N_a$).\n$$ \\text{BO} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_b - N_a) $$\nFrom the electron configuration:\n- The bonding orbitals are $\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\pi_{2p_x}$, and $\\pi_{2p_y}$. The number of electrons in these orbitals is $N_b = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n- The antibonding orbital populated is $\\sigma_{2s}^{\\ast}$. The number of electrons in this orbital is $N_a = 2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for bond order:\n$$ \\text{BO} = \\frac{1}{2} (4 - 2) = \\frac{1}{2} (2) = 1 $$\nThe bond order of $\\mathrm{B}_2$ is $1$, which corresponds to a single bond.\n\nNow, we compute the spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_S$. For light molecules where the orbital angular momentum contribution is quenched, the magnetic moment is well-approximated by the spin-only formula:\n$$ \\mu_S = \\sqrt{n(n+2)} \\, \\mu_B $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of unpaired electrons and $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. As determined previously, $n=2$.\nSubstituting this value:\n$$ \\mu_S = \\sqrt{2(2+2)} \\, \\mu_B = \\sqrt{2(4)} \\, \\mu_B = \\sqrt{8} \\, \\mu_B = 2\\sqrt{2} \\, \\mu_B $$\nThe value of the spin-only magnetic moment is $2\\sqrt{2}$ in units of Bohr magnetons.\n\nFinally, we contrast the MO prediction with a simple Valence Bond (VB) theory picture. In a simple VB model, bonding arises from the overlap of atomic orbitals containing one electron each. The valence configuration of a Boron atom is $2s^2 2p^1$. The $2s$ orbital is filled and its electrons are a lone pair. This leaves the singly occupied $2p$ orbital on each atom available for bonding. The overlap of the two half-filled $2p$ orbitals (one from each B atom) would form a single covalent bond (a $\\sigma$ bond). In this process, the two electrons are paired up within the bond. All other valence electrons (the two $2s^2$ pairs) are also paired. Consequently, the simple VB model predicts that the $\\mathrm{B}_2$ molecule has no unpaired electrons ($n=0$) and should therefore be diamagnetic. This prediction is in direct contradiction with experimental evidence, which shows that $\\mathrm{B}_2$ is paramagnetic. The MO theory, by delocalizing electrons across the entire molecule and correctly applying Hund's rule to degenerate $\\pi$ orbitals, naturally and correctly predicts the paramagnetism of $\\mathrm{B}_2$ with two unpaired electrons. The success of MO theory in this case is a classic example of its superiority over simple VB theory for describing the electronic structure of certain molecules.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2652665"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative predictions, this exercise delves into the quantitative interpretation of a molecular wavefunction for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule.

Thus, we identify the energies as:\n$$\nE_{+} = \\frac{H_{AA} + \\beta}{1+S} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E_{-} = \\frac{H_{AA} - \\beta}{1-S}\n$$\nTo find the inverse relations, we treat these as a system of two linear equations for $H_{AA}$ and $\\beta$:\n1. $E_{+}(1+S) = H_{AA} + \\beta$\n2. $E_{-}(1-S) = H_{AA} - \\beta$\n\nAdding (1) and (2) gives: $E_{+}(1+S) + E_{-}(1-S) = 2H_{AA}$, which simplifies to:\n$$\nH_{AA} = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( E_{+} + E_{-} + S(E_{+} - E_{-}) \\big)\n$$\nSubtracting (2) from (1) gives: $E_{+}(1+S) - E_{-}(1-S) = 2\\beta$, which simplifies to:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( E_{+} - E_{-} + S(E_{+} + E_{-}) \\big)\n$$\nThese are the required expressions.\n\n**2. Computation of Model Parameters**\n\nFirst, the overlap integral $S(R)$ is computed at $R=2$ and $R=1.4$ (in atomic units, $a_0=1$).\n$$\nS(R) = \\exp(-R) \\left( 1 + R + \\frac{R^2}{3} \\right)\n$$\nAt $R_1=2$:\n$S(2) = \\exp(-2) \\left( 1 + 2 + \\frac{2^2}{3} \\right) = \\frac{13}{3} \\exp(-2) \\approx 0.586118$\nAt $R_2=1.4$:\n$S(1.4) = \\exp(-1.4) \\left( 1 + 1.4 + \\frac{(1.4)^2}{3} \\right) \\approx 0.752835$\n\nNow, we use the inverse relations and provided energies to find the parameters.\nAt $R=2$: $E_{+} = -0.6000$, $E_{-} = -0.4010$.\n$E_{+} + E_{-} = -1.0010$\n$E_{+} - E_{-} = -0.1990$\n$$\nH_{AA}(2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -1.0010 + S(2)(-0.1990) \\big) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -1.0010 + (0.586118)(-0.1990) \\big) \\approx -0.558819\n$$\n$$\n\\beta(2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -0.1990 + S(2)(-1.0010) \\big) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -0.1990 + (0.586118)(-1.0010) \\big) \\approx -0.392852\n$$\nAt $R=1.4$: $E_{+} = -0.6800$, $E_{-} = -0.3300$.\n$E_{+} + E_{-} = -1.0100$\n$E_{+} - E_{-} = -0.3500$\n$$\n\\beta(1.4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -0.3500 + S(1.4)(-1.0100) \\big) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\big( -0.3500 + (0.752835)(-1.0100) \\big) \\approx -0.555182\n$$\n\n**3. and 4. Approximations and Error Calculation**\n\nWe now evaluate the two approximations for the energies at $R=2$. The \"exact\" energies are $E_{+}^{\\text{exact}} = -0.6000$ and $E_{-}^{\\text{exact}} = -0.4010$.\n\n**Approximation A (neglect overlap):**\nWe set $S(2)=0$ but use the parameters $H_{AA}(2) \\approx -0.558819$ and $\\beta(2) \\approx -0.392852$ derived previously.\nThe energy expressions simplify to $E_{\\pm}^{\\text{A}} = H_{AA} \\pm \\beta$.\n$$\nE_{+}^{\\text{A}} = H_{AA}(2) + \\beta(2) \\approx -0.558819 - 0.392852 = -0.951671\n$$\n$$\nE_{-}^{\\text{A}} = H_{AA}(2) - \\beta(2) \\approx -0.558819 - (-0.392852) = -0.165967\n$$\nThe errors are:\n$\\Delta E_{+}^{\\text{A}} = E_{+}^{\\text{A}} - E_{+}^{\\text{exact}} \\approx -0.951671 - (-0.6000) = -0.351671$\n$\\Delta E_{-}^{\\text{A}} = E_{-}^{\\text{A}} - E_{-}^{\\text{exact}} \\approx -0.165967 - (-0.4010) = 0.235033$\nThe RMSE is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE}[\\text{A}] = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\Delta E_{+}^{\\text{A}})^2 + (\\Delta E_{-}^{\\text{A}})^2}{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(-0.351671)^2 + (0.235033)^2}{2}} \\approx 0.299093\n$$\n\n**Approximation B (distance-independent resonance integral):**\nWe use $\\beta(2) \\approx \\beta(1.4) \\approx -0.555182$, while retaining the exact values for $H_{AA}(2) \\approx -0.558819$ and $S(2) \\approx 0.586118$.\nThe energy expressions are $E_{\\pm}^{\\text{B}} = (H_{AA} \\pm \\beta_{\\text{approx}})/(1 \\pm S)$.\n$$\nE_{+}^{\\text{B}} = \\frac{H_{AA}(2) + \\beta(1.4)}{1 + S(2)} \\approx \\frac{-0.558819 - 0.555182}{1 + 0.586118} \\approx \\frac{-1.114001}{1.586118} \\approx -0.702345\n$$\n$$\nE_{-}^{\\text{B}} = \\frac{H_{AA}(2) - \\beta(1.4)}{1 - S(2)} \\approx \\frac{-0.558819 - (-0.555182)}{1 - 0.586118} \\approx \\frac{-0.003637}{0.413882} \\approx -0.008788\n$$\nThe errors are:\n$\\Delta E_{+}^{\\text{B}} = E_{+}^{\\text{B}} - E_{+}^{\\text{exact}} \\approx -0.702345 - (-0.6000) = -0.102345$\n$\\Delta E_{-}^{\\text{B}} = E_{-}^{\\text{B}} - E_{-}^{\\text{exact}} \\approx -0.008788 - (-0.4010) = 0.392212$\nThe RMSE is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE}[\\text{B}] = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\Delta E_{+}^{\\text{B}})^2 + (\\Delta E_{-}^{\\text{B}})^2}{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(-0.102345)^2 + (0.392212)^2}{2}} \\approx 0.286622\n$$\n\n**5.
