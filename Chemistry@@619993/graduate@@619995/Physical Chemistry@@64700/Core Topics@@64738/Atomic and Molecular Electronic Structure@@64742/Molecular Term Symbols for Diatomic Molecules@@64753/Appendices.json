No rounding is required. Do not include any units in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous solution. We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe task is to determine key quantum numbers and properties for the ground electronic state of the molecular ion $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$, where a single electron occupies the lowest-energy molecular orbital, designated as $\\sigma_g$.\n\nFirst, we shall determine the ground electronic term symbol, which is conventionally written in the form $^{2S+1}\\Lambda_{g/u}^{(\\pm)}$. We must derive each component from fundamental principles.\nThe total electronic spin angular momentum quantum number, $S$, is the vector sum of the spin quantum numbers of the individual electrons. For a single-electron system such as $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$, the total spin $S$ is simply the spin of that one electron, which is $s = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $S = \\frac{1}{2}$. The spin multiplicity is given by the expression $2S+1$. Substituting the value of $S$, we find the multiplicity is $2(\\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = 2$. This is a doublet state.\n\nThe quantum number $\\Lambda$ represents the absolute value of the total projection of the electronic orbital angular momentum onto the internuclear axis. It is calculated as $\\Lambda = |\\sum_i m_{l_i}|$, where $m_{l_i}$ is the projection for the $i$-th electron. The problem specifies that the electron is in a $\\sigma$ orbital. By definition, a $\\sigma$ orbital is one for which the projection of orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis is zero, i.e., $m_l = 0$. Since there is only one electron, the total projection is also zero, and thus $\\Lambda = 0$. Electronic states with $\\Lambda = 0$ are denoted by the capital Greek letter $\\Sigma$.\n\nThe inversion symmetry for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is indicated by a subscript $g$ (for *gerade*, or even) or $u$ (for *ungerade*, or odd) depending on whether the total electronic wavefunction remains unchanged or changes sign upon inversion through the molecule's center of mass. The problem states that the electron occupies the $\\sigma_g$ orbital. For a single-electron system, the overall symmetry of the state is identical to the symmetry of the occupied orbital. As the orbital has $g$ symmetry, the electronic state is also *gerade*.\n\nThe reflection symmetry, denoted by a superscript $+$ or $-$, is a property of $\\Sigma$ states ($\\Lambda=0$) only. It describes the symmetry of the electronic wavefunction with respect to reflection through an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis. For a single electron in a $\\sigma$ orbital, the wavefunction is cylindrically symmetric about the internuclear axis. Consequently, such a reflection leaves the wavefunction completely unchanged. This corresponds to $+$ symmetry.\nCombining these components, we determine the ground electronic term symbol for $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ to be $^2\\Sigma_g^+$.\n\nSecond, we address the matter of spin-orbit coupling and the splitting of the electronic state. The total electronic angular momentum projected on the internuclear axis is given by the quantum number $\\Omega = |\\Lambda + \\Sigma|$, where $\\Sigma$ is the projection of the total spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$ onto the axis. For a state with total spin $S = \\frac{1}{2}$, the possible values for the projection quantum number $\\Sigma$ are $M_S = +\\frac{1}{2}$ and $M_S = -\\frac{1}{2}$. With $\\Lambda = 0$, the corresponding value for $\\Omega$ is $\\Omega = |0 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{1}{2}$. There is only one possible value for $\\Omega$. Spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic effect that couples the electron's spin to its orbital motion. In Hund's case (a), this interaction splits electronic terms with $\\Lambda > 0$ into multiple fine-structure components, characterized by different values of $\\Omega$. The energy of this interaction is, to first order, proportional to $A \\Lambda \\Sigma$, where $A$ is the spin-orbit coupling constant. For a $\\Sigma$ state, where $\\Lambda = 0$, this first-order interaction energy vanishes. Therefore, spin-orbit coupling does not split the $^2\\Sigma_g^+$ state into multiple $\\Omega$ components. The state remains a single level with a unique, well-defined value of $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThird, we must clarify the meaning of the phrase \"absence of spin multiplicity\". This description is not to be taken as the spin multiplicity being unity ($2S+1=1$), which would imply a singlet state ($S=0$). This is impossible for a one-electron system. Instead, the phrase refers to the fact that for a system with only one electron, the total spin quantum number $S$ is unequivocally fixed to be $S = \\frac{1}{2}$. Consequently, the spin multiplicity is also fixed at the single value $2S+1=2$. This is fundamentally different from a multi-electron system, where the same electronic configuration can often give rise to several electronic states with different total spins $S$ (and thus different multiplicities) depending on how the individual electron spins couple. For instance, a two-electron configuration can result in both singlet ($S=0$) and triplet ($S=1$) states. For $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$, such a choice does not exist; only one spin multiplicity is possible. The \"absence\" is thus an absence of alternatives for the spin multiplicity of the state.\n\nThe final answer requires the values for the spin multiplicity ($2S+1$), $\\Lambda$, and the unique value of $\\Omega$ for the ground state. From our rigorous derivation:\nSpin multiplicity: $2S+1 = 2$.\nLambda: $\\Lambda = 0$.\nOmega: $\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2653031"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, we now advance to a multi-electron system with two equivalent electrons in a $\\pi_g$ orbital.

The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the total electronic wavefunction be antisymmetric under exchange of the two electrons.

Explain qualitatively how the exchange symmetry links the appearance of $\\Sigma^{+}$ versus $\\Sigma^{-}$ with singlet ($S=0$) versus triplet ($S=1$) spin coupling in this configuration.\n\n3. Verify internal consistency by summing the degeneracies of all allowed terms and comparing this sum to the total number of distinct two-electron Slater-determinant microstates available within the $\\pi_{g}$ set. Here, the degeneracy associated with a given term arises from the spin multiplicity factor $(2S+1)$ and, for $|\\Lambda|>0$, the presence of both $+\\Lambda$ and $-\\Lambda$ components, whereas for $\\Lambda=0$ there is only a single component for each of $\\Sigma^{+}$ and $\\Sigma^{-}$.\n\nCompute the total number $N$ of distinct Slater-determinant microstates available within the $\\pi_{g}$ set for the $\\pi_{g}^{2}$ configuration under the Pauli principle, and report $N$ as your final answer.

This signifies two electrons occupying a doubly degenerate set of $\\pi_{g}$ molecular orbitals. These two orbitals are distinguished by the projection of the single-electron orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis, having quantum numbers $\\lambda=+1$ and $\\lambda=-1$. We denote these orbitals as $\\pi_{g,+}$ and $\\pi_{g,-}$, respectively. Each electron has a spin quantum number $s=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, with projection $m_s = \\pm\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\n1. Construction and Classification of Microstates\n\nA microstate is defined by a specific assignment of quantum numbers to all electrons. For the two-electron system, the state is described by $(\\lambda_1, m_{s1}; \\lambda_2, m_{s2})$. The Pauli exclusion principle mandates that the total electronic wavefunction be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons. This principle is automatically satisfied by constructing the wavefunction as a Slater determinant.\n\nThe available single-electron spin-orbitals are $\\pi_{g,+}\\alpha$, $\\pi_{g,+}\\beta$, $\\pi_{g,-}\\alpha$, and $\\pi_{g,-}\\beta$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ represent spin-up ($m_s=+\\tfrac{1}{2}$) and spin-down ($m_s=-\\tfrac{1}{2}$) states, respectively. We must place $2$ electrons into these $4$ distinct spin-orbitals. The total number of unique microstates is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$.\n\nWe classify these $6$ microstates according to the total projection of orbital angular momentum, $M_L = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2$, and the total projection of spin angular momentum, $M_S = m_{s1} + m_{s2}$.\n\nThe possible microstates are:\n- Electrons in the same spatial orbital ($\\pi_{g,+}$ or $\\pi_{g,-}$): Spin must be paired ($\\alpha\\beta$) to satisfy the Pauli principle.\n    1.  Both electrons in $\\pi_{g,+}$: $(\\pi_{g,+}\\alpha, \\pi_{g,+}\\beta)$. $M_L = 1+1 = 2$. $M_S = \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0$.\n    2.  Both electrons in $\\pi_{g,-}$: $(\\pi_{g,-}\\alpha, \\pi_{g,-}\\beta)$. $M_L = -1-1 = -2$. $M_S = \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0$.\n- Electrons in different spatial orbitals ($\\pi_{g,+}$ and $\\pi_{g,-}$): No restriction on spin orientation.\n    3.  Electron $1$ in $\\pi_{g,+}$ ($\\alpha$), electron $2$ in $\\pi_{g,-}$ ($\\alpha$): $M_L = 1-1=0$. $M_S = \\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2} = 1$.\n    4.  Electron $1$ in $\\pi_{g,+}$ ($\\beta$), electron $2$ in $\\pi_{g,-}$ ($\\beta$): $M_L = 1-1=0$. $M_S = -\\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2} = -1$.\n    5.  Electron $1$ in $\\pi_{g,+}$ ($\\alpha$), electron $2$ in $\\pi_{g,-}$ ($\\beta$): $M_L = 1-1=0$. $M_S = \\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0$.\n    6.  Electron $1$ in $\\pi_{g,+}$ ($\\beta$), electron $2$ in $\\pi_{g,-}$ ($\\alpha$): $M_L = 1-1=0$. $M_S = -\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2} = 0$.\n\nNow we group these microstates into term symbols ${}^{2S+1}\\Lambda_{g/u}^{\\pm}$. The inversion parity is determined by the product of the parities of the occupied orbitals. Here, both orbitals are $\\pi_g$, so the overall parity is $g \\otimes g = g$ for all resulting terms.\n\n- **${}^1\\Delta_g$ Term:** The states with the maximum value of $|M_L|$ are $M_L=2$ and $M_L=-2$. These correspond to microstates $1$ and $2$. Both have $M_S=0$. This indicates they belong to a term with $\\Lambda=|M_L|_{max}=2$ and $S=0$. This is a ${}^1\\Delta$ term. With $g$ parity, we have ${}^1\\Delta_g$. This term accounts for $2$ microstates.\n\n- **$\\Sigma$ Terms:** The remaining $4$ microstates all have $M_L=0$, and thus belong to $\\Sigma$ terms ($\\Lambda=0$). These are microstates $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. The available $(M_L, M_S)$ values are $(0, 1)$, $(0, -1)$, and two states with $(0, 0)$.\n\n- **${}^3\\Sigma_g^{-}$ Term:** The microstates with $M_S=1$ and $M_S=-1$ (states $3$ and $4$) must belong to a triplet term ($S=1$). To complete the triplet, we need one state with $M_S=0$. The proper linear combination of states $5$ and $6$ that is symmetric with respect to spin exchange forms the $M_S=0$ component of the triplet. The corresponding spatial wavefunction for this triplet state must be antisymmetric to satisfy the Pauli principle: $\\Psi_{space} \\propto \\pi_{g,+}(1)\\pi_{g,-}(2) - \\pi_{g,-}(1)\\pi_{g,+}(2)$. Reflection through a plane containing the internuclear axis (a $\\sigma_v$ operation) corresponds to interchanging $\\pi_{g,+}$ and $\\pi_{g,-}$. This operation transforms the spatial wavefunction as $\\Psi_{space} \\to -\\Psi_{space}$. This negative sign defines a $\\Sigma^{-}$ state. Thus, we have a ${}^3\\Sigma_g^{-}$ term. This term accounts for $3$ microstates (for $M_S = -1, 0, 1$).\n\n- **${}^1\\Sigma_g^{+}$ Term:** One state with $(M_L, M_S)=(0,0)$ remains. It is the linear combination of states $5$ and $6$ that is antisymmetric with respect to spin exchange (a singlet state, $S=0$). The corresponding spatial wavefunction must be symmetric: $\\Psi_{space} \\propto \\pi_{g,+}(1)\\pi_{g,-}(2) + \\pi_{g,-}(1)\\pi_{g,+}(2)$. Upon the $\\sigma_v$ reflection, this wavefunction transforms as $\\Psi_{space} \\to +\\Psi_{space}$, which defines a $\\Sigma^{+}$ state. Thus, we have a ${}^1\\Sigma_g^{+}$ term. This accounts for the final, single microstate.\n\nIn summary, the allowed molecular terms arising from the $\\pi_{g}^{2}$ configuration are ${}^1\\Delta_g$, ${}^3\\Sigma_g^{-}$, and ${}^1\\Sigma_g^{+}$.\n\n2. Symmetry-Adapted Reasoning\n\nThe problem can be analyzed using group theory by considering the direct product of the irreducible representations (irreps) corresponding to the two $\\pi_g$ orbitals. In the $D_{\\infty h}$ point group, a $\\pi_g$ orbital belongs to the $E_{1g}$ irrep (often denoted $\\Pi_g$). The spatial symmetry of the two-electron states is found by decomposing the direct product $\\Pi_g \\otimes \\Pi_g$.\n\nSince the two electrons are in equivalent orbitals, the total wavefunction $\\Psi_{total} = \\Psi_{space} \\otimes \\Psi_{spin}$ must be antisymmetric. The two electron spins ($s=\\tfrac{1}{2}$) couple to form a symmetric triplet state ($S=1$) and an antisymmetric singlet state ($S=0$). To ensure $\\Psi_{total}$ is antisymmetric:\n- A symmetric spatial state $\\Psi_{space}$ must be paired with the antisymmetric singlet spin state.\n- An antisymmetric spatial state $\\Psi_{space}$ must be paired with the symmetric triplet spin state.\n\nThe direct product $\\Pi_g \\otimes \\Pi_g$ can be decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts. The characters for the symmetric $[\\Pi_g \\otimes \\Pi_g]_{sym}$ and antisymmetric $\\{\\Pi_g \\otimes \\Pi_g\\}_{anti}$ products are given by:\n$\\chi_{sym}(\\hat{R}) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\chi^{\\Pi_g}(\\hat{R})^2 + \\chi^{\\Pi_g}(\\hat{R}^2)]$\n$\\chi_{anti}(\\hat{R}) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\chi^{\\Pi_g}(\\hat{R})^2 - \\chi^{\\Pi_g}(\\hat{R}^2)]$\n\nFor rotation $C(\\phi)$: $\\chi^{\\Pi_g}(C(\\phi))=2\\cos(\\phi)$ and $\\chi^{\\Pi_g}((C(\\phi))^2) = \\chi^{\\Pi_g}(C(2\\phi)) = 2\\cos(2\\phi)$.\n$\\chi_{sym}(C(\\phi)) = \\frac{1}{2}[(2\\cos\\phi)^2 + 2\\cos(2\\phi)] = \\frac{1}{2}[4\\cos^2\\phi + 2\\cos(2\\phi)] = 1+2\\cos(2\\phi)$. This is the sum of characters for $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Delta_g$.\n$\\chi_{anti}(C(\\phi)) = \\frac{1}{2}[(2\\cos\\phi)^2 - 2\\cos(2\\phi)] = 1$. This is the character for a $\\Sigma_g$ state.\n\nFor reflection $\\sigma_v$: $\\chi^{\\Pi_g}(\\sigma_v)=0$ and $\\chi^{\\Pi_g}((\\sigma_v)^2) = \\chi^{\\Pi_g}(E)=2$.\n$\\chi_{sym}(\\sigma_v) = \\frac{1}{2}[0^2+2] = 1$.\n$\\chi_{anti}(\\sigma_v) = \\frac{1}{2}[0^2-2] = -1$.\n\nThe symmetric spatial part has characters corresponding to $\\Sigma_g^{+}$ (character is $+1$ for $\\sigma_v$) and $\\Delta_g$. This symmetric part must be paired with the singlet spin state ($S=0$), yielding the terms ${}^1\\Sigma_g^{+}$ and ${}^1\\Delta_g$.\nThe antisymmetric spatial part has character $1$ for $C(\\phi)$ and $-1$ for $\\sigma_v$, which are the characters of the $\\Sigma_g^{-}$ irrep. This antisymmetric part must be paired with the triplet spin state ($S=1$), yielding the term ${}^3\\Sigma_g^{-}$.\nThis confirms the result from the microstate analysis. The appearance of $\\Sigma^{+}$ vs $\\Sigma^{-}$ is directly linked to the exchange symmetry of the spatial wavefunction, which in turn determines whether it must couple to a singlet or a triplet spin state to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n3. Consistency Check and Final Calculation\n\nWe verify that the sum of the degeneracies of the derived terms equals the total number of available microstates.\n- Degeneracy of ${}^1\\Delta_g$: $\\Lambda=2, S=0$. Degeneracy is $(2S+1) \\times 2 = (2 \\cdot 0+1) \\times 2 = 2$.\n- Degeneracy of ${}^3\\Sigma_g^{-}$: $\\Lambda=0, S=1$. Degeneracy is $(2S+1) \\times 1 = (2 \\cdot 1+1) \\times 1 = 3$.\n- Degeneracy of ${}^1\\Sigma_g^{+}$: $\\Lambda=0, S=0$. Degeneracy is $(2S+1) \\times 1 = (2 \\cdot 0+1) \\times 1 = 1$.\nThe sum of degeneracies is $2+3+1 = 6$.\n\nThe total number $N$ of distinct Slater-determinant microstates is the number of ways to place $k=2$ electrons into $n$ available spin-orbitals. The $\\pi_g$ shell is doubly degenerate spatially ($\\lambda=\\pm 1$), and each spatial orbital can accommodate two electrons of opposite spin. Therefore, there are $n=2 \\times 2 = 4$ available spin-orbitals.\nThe number of ways to choose $2$ spin-orbitals out of $4$ is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$ N = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6 $$\nThe sum of the term degeneracies ($6$) is consistent with the total number of microstates ($N=6$). The problem asks for this value $N$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "2653053"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem applies these concepts to a more complex system with multiple open shells, the $\\pi^3\\sigma^1$ configuration.

The constraints, such as neglecting parity and focusing on ${}^{2S+1}\\Lambda$ terms, are clearly stated and physically justified for a heteronuclear species. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nWe proceed by determining the term symbols arising from the specified configuration and then identifying the ground term. The total angular momentum quantum numbers, $\\Lambda$ and $S$, are found by coupling the angular momenta of the electrons in the open shells. The configuration $\\pi^{3}\\sigma^{1}$ consists of two open subshells.\n\nFirst, consider the $\\pi^{3}$ subshell. A $\\pi$ molecular orbital is doubly degenerate, characterized by orbital angular momentum projection quantum numbers $m_{\\lambda} = +1$ and $m_{\\lambda} = -1$. A $\\pi^{3}$ configuration is most easily analyzed using the concept of electron-hole equivalence. A fully occupied $\\pi^{4}$ subshell is a closed shell with total $M_{L} = 0$ and total $M_{S} = 0$, giving rise to a ${}^{1}\\Sigma$ term. The term symbols for a configuration with $k$ holes in a subshell are the same as those for a configuration with $k$ electrons. The $\\pi^{3}$ configuration has one hole in the $\\pi$ shell. This is equivalent to a $\\pi^{1}$ configuration. For a single electron in a $\\pi$ orbital ($\\pi^{1}$), the orbital angular momentum projection is $m_{\\lambda} = \\pm 1$, so the magnitude is $\\Lambda_{1} = |m_{\\lambda}| = 1$. The electron has spin $s=1/2$, so the total spin for this subshell is $S_{1} = 1/2$. The term arising from the $\\pi^{3}$ configuration is therefore ${}^{2S_{1}+1}\\Lambda_{1} = {}^{2(1/2)+1}\\Pi = {}^{2}\\Pi$.\n\nSecond, consider the $\\sigma^{1}$ subshell. A $\\sigma$ orbital is non-degenerate, with $m_{\\lambda} = 0$. For a single electron ($\\sigma^{1}$), the orbital angular momentum contribution is $\\Lambda_{2} = |m_{\\lambda}| = 0$. The spin is $s=1/2$, so the total spin for this subshell is $S_{2} = 1/2$. The term arising from the $\\sigma^{1}$ configuration is ${}^{2S_{2}+1}\\Lambda_{2} = {}^{2(1/2)+1}\\Sigma = {}^{2}\\Sigma$.\n\nNext, we couple the ${}^{2}\\Pi$ ($\\Lambda_{1} = 1$, $S_{1} = 1/2$) and ${}^{2}\\Sigma$ ($\\Lambda_{2} = 0$, $S_{2} = 1/2$) terms to find the total $\\Lambda$ and $S$ for the $\\pi^{3}\\sigma^{1}$ configuration.\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum projection $M_{L}$ is the sum of the individual projections $M_{L1}$ and $M_{L2}$. For the ${}^{2}\\Pi$ term, $M_{L1} = \\pm \\Lambda_{1} = \\pm 1$. For the ${}^{2}\\Sigma$ term, $M_{L2} = 0$.\nThus, $M_{L} = M_{L1} + M_{L2} = (\\pm 1) + 0 = \\pm 1$.\nThe magnitude of the total orbital angular momentum projection is $\\Lambda = |M_{L}| = 1$, which corresponds to a $\\Pi$ state.\n\nThe total spin quantum number $S$ is obtained by coupling $S_{1} = 1/2$ and $S_{2} = 1/2$. The possible values for $S$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n$$ S = |S_{1} - S_{2}|, |S_{1} - S_{2}| + 1, \\ldots, S_{1} + S_{2} $$\n$$ S = |\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}|, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis yields $S=0$ and $S=1$.\n\nCombining the possible $S$ values with the determined $\\Lambda$ value, we obtain the molecular term symbols ${}^{2S+1}\\Lambda$:\n1.  For $S=0$, the spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(0)+1 = 1$. This gives a ${}^{1}\\Pi$ term.\n2.  For $S=1$, the spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$. This gives a ${}^{3}\\Pi$ term.\n\nThis enumerates all possible terms for part (a): ${}^{1}\\Pi$ and ${}^{3}\\Pi$.\n\nFor part (b), we must identify the ground electronic term using Hund's rules.\nHund's first rule states that the term with the highest spin multiplicity (maximum $S$) has the lowest energy.\nComparing the terms ${}^{3}\\Pi$ ($S=1$) and ${}^{1}\\Pi$ ($S=0$), the ${}^{3}\\Pi$ term has the higher multiplicity. Therefore, the ground electronic term is ${}^{3}\\Pi$.\nHund's second rule (for a given $S$, the term with the highest $\\Lambda$ is lowest) is not required for this comparison since the $S$ values are different.\n\nFinally, the question asks for the value of the spin multiplicity $2S+1$ for the ground electronic term. The ground term is ${}^{3}\\Pi$. In the notation ${}^{2S+1}\\Lambda$, the spin multiplicity is the leading superscript. For the ${}^{3}\\Pi$ term, the spin multiplicity is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2653078"}]}
