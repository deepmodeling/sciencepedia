For the $x$-dimension, this means $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L) = 0$.\n\nThe general solution to the one-dimensional equation for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x) + B \\cos(k_x x)$, where $k_x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE_x}}{\\hbar}$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $X(0) = 0$, gives $A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0$. The solution reduces to $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $X(L) = 0$, gives $A \\sin(k_x L) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(k_x L) = 0$. This condition is met when $k_x L = n_x \\pi$, where $n_x$ is an integer. The case $n_x=0$ would lead to $k_x=0$ and $X(x)=0$ everywhere, which is a trivial solution and is discarded. Negative integers for $n_x$ do not produce new physical states, as $\\sin(-u) = -\\sin(u)$, and the negative sign is absorbed into the normalization constant.

In a general cuboid with side lengths $L_x, L_y, L_z$, the energy would be $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{n_x^2}{L_x^2} + \\frac{n_y^2}{L_y^2} + \\frac{n_z^2}{L_z^2} \\right)$. In such a case, permuting the quantum numbers (e.g., swapping $n_x$ and $n_y$) would in general lead to a different energy, unless $L_x=L_y$. For a cube, $L_x=L_y=L_z=L$, and the energy expression depends symmetrically on $n_x, n_y, n_z$ through the sum of their squares, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2$. Consequently, any permutation of a given set of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ will result in the same value for the sum of squares, and therefore the same energy. For instance, if $n_x \\neq n_y$, the state $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ and the state $(n_y, n_x, n_z)$ are distinct states (they have different wavefunctions), but they share the same energy. This is an example of \"exchange degeneracy,\" a consequence of the spatial symmetry of the Hamiltonian.\n\nWe now address the specific energy level labeled by the quantum numbers $(1,1,2)$. The \"label\" refers to one specific state, but we must find all states with the same energy. The energy of this level is determined by the sum of the squares of the quantum numbers:\n$$ S = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 $$\nThe energy of this level is $E_{1,1,2} = \\frac{6 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The degeneracy of this energy level is the number of distinct triplets of positive integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ for which the sum of squares is $6$. We seek all unique permutations of the triplet $(1,1,2)$. The distinct ordered triplets are:\n$1$. $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 1, 2)$\n$2$. $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 2, 1)$\n$3$. $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (2, 1, 1)$\nEach of these triplets corresponds to a unique wavefunction (an eigenstate) but yields the same energy eigenvalue. The number of such distinct triplets is the degeneracy of the energy level. For this case, there are $3$ such triplets. Therefore, the degeneracy is $3$.\nThere are no other combinations of three positive integers whose squares sum to $6$. For example, if we tried to use $n=3$, $3^2=9>6$, so no quantum number can be $3$ or higher. If all numbers were $1$, the sum is $1^2+1^2+1^2=3$. The only set of positive integers whose squares sum to $6$ is $\\{1, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe degeneracy due to the cubic symmetry is the number of distinct permutations of this set of numbers, which is $\\frac{3!}{2!} = 3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2663088"}, {"introduction": "Building directly on the concept of symmetry-induced degeneracy, this final practice explores what happens when that perfect symmetry is broken.

The total energy is the sum of the energies associated with each dimension: $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$.\n\nFor the $x$-dimension, the equation is:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = E_x X(x) $$\nThe boundary conditions are that the wavefunction must vanish at the walls of the infinite potential well, so $X(0) = 0$ and $X(L_x) = 0$.\nThe general solution to the equation is $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x) + B \\cos(k_x x)$, where $k_x = \\sqrt{2mE_x}/\\hbar$.\nThe condition $X(0)=0$ requires $B=0$.\nThe condition $X(L_x)=0$ requires $A \\sin(k_x L_x) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\ne 0$), we must have $k_x L_x = n_x \\pi$, where $n_x$ is a positive integer ($n_x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\nThus, the wave number is quantized: $k_x = \\frac{n_x \\pi}{L_x}$.\nThe energy for the $x$-dimension is then:\n$$ E_x = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n_x^2}{2m L_x^2} $$\nBy identical reasoning for the $y$ and $z$ dimensions, we find the total energy for the state $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ in a rectangular box of dimensions $L_x, L_y, L_z$:\n$$ E_{(n_x, n_y, n_z)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{n_x^2}{L_x^2} + \\frac{n_y^2}{L_y^2} + \\frac{n_z^2}{L_z^2} \\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the energy eigenvalues.\n\nNow, we introduce the specified anisotropic dimensions: $L_x = L(1+\\epsilon)$, $L_y = L(1-\\epsilon)$, and $L_z = L$. Substituting these into the energy expression gives:\n$$ E_{(n_x, n_y, n_z)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{n_x^2}{[L(1+\\epsilon)]^2} + \\frac{n_y^2}{[L(1-\\epsilon)]^2} + \\frac{n_z^2}{L^2} \\right) $$\n$$ E_{(n_x, n_y, n_z)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left( n_x^2(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} + n_y^2(1-\\epsilon)^{-2} + n_z^2 \\right) $$\nThe problem requires a solution to first order in $\\epsilon$. For $|\\epsilon| \\ll 1$, we use the binomial series expansion $(1+x)^\\alpha \\approx 1+\\alpha x$.\nThus, $(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$ and $(1-\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2(-\\epsilon) = 1 + 2\\epsilon$.\nSubstituting these first-order approximations into the energy expression:\n$$ E_{(n_x, n_y, n_z)} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left[ n_x^2(1 - 2\\epsilon) + n_y^2(1 + 2\\epsilon) + n_z^2 \\right] $$\n$$ E_{(n_x, n_y, n_z)} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left[ (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) - 2\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) \\right] $$\nThis is the energy of the state $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\nNext, we determine the energy of the permuted state $(n_y, n_x, n_z)$. We can obtain this by simply exchanging $n_x$ and $n_y$ in the expression above:\n$$ E_{(n_y, n_x, n_z)} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left[ (n_y^2 + n_x^2 + n_z^2) - 2\\epsilon(n_y^2 - n_x^2) \\right] $$\n$$ E_{(n_y, n_x, n_z)} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left[ (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) + 2\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) \\right] $$\nThe task is to compute the energy splitting $\\Delta E = E_{(n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})} - E_{(n_{y},n_{x},n_{z})}$.\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left\\{ \\left[ (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) - 2\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) \\right] - \\left[ (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) + 2\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) \\right] \\right\\} $$\nThe unperturbed energy terms, which are identical for both states, cancel. We are left with:\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left[ -2\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) - 2\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2mL^2} \\left[ -4\\epsilon(n_x^2 - n_y^2) \\right] $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the energy splitting to first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\Delta E = -\\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{m L^2} \\epsilon (n_x^2 - n_y^2) $$\nThe expression is given in terms of the required variables and fundamental constants.
