Therefore, all states with the same $n$ but different allowed values of $l$ and $m_l$ are degenerate in energy. This \"accidental\" degeneracy is a special feature of the $1/r$ Coulomb potential.\n\nTo find the total orbital degeneracy for a given $n$, we must sum the number of distinct states for all possible values of $l$ associated with that $n$.
