Derivation of Electric-Dipole Selection Rules\nThe probability of a transition between an initial state $|\\Psi_i\\rangle$ and a final state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle$ induced by an electric field is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the transition dipole moment integral, $\\vec{\\mu}_{fi} = \\langle \\Psi_f | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\Psi_i \\rangle$. A transition is \"allowed\" if this integral is non-zero. For a rigid linear rotor, the wavefunctions are the spherical harmonics, $|\\Psi\\rangle = |J, M\\rangle = Y_J^M(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number and $M$ is its projection onto the space-fixed $z$-axis. The initial state is $|J', M'\\rangle$ and the final state is $|J'', M''\\rangle$.\n\nThe electric dipole moment operator $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is a vector fixed in the molecule's frame with constant magnitude $\\mu_0$. Its components in the space-fixed frame are:\n$$\n\\mu_x = \\mu_0 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi \\\\\n\\mu_y = \\mu_0 \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\\n\\mu_z = \\mu_0 \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThese components can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_l^m(\\theta, \\phi)$:\n$$\n\\mu_z = \\mu_0 \\cos\\theta = \\mu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_x \\pm i\\mu_y = \\mu_0 \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi} = \\mp \\mu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi}{3}} Y_1^{\\pm 1}(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\nFor a transition to be allowed, at least one component of $\\vec{\\mu}_{fi}$ must be non-zero. Let us examine the integral for the $z$-component:\n$$\n\\langle J'', M'' | \\mu_z | J', M' \\rangle \\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi (Y_{J''}^{M''})^* Y_1^0 Y_{J'}^{M'} \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi\n$$\nThis is an integral over a product of three spherical harmonics. From the theory of angular momentum (specifically, the Wigner-Eckart theorem or the properties of Gaunt coefficients), this integral is non-zero only if two conditions are met:\n(a) The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is conserved: $M'' = M' + 0$, which implies $\\Delta M = M'' - M' = 0$.\n(b) The angular momentum quantum numbers satisfy the triangle inequality: $|J' - 1| \\le J'' \\le J' + 1$. This implies that $\\Delta J = J'' - J'$ can only be $0$, $+1$, or $-1$.\n\nSimilarly, for the $\\mu_x \\pm i\\mu_y$ components, which are proportional to $Y_1^{\\pm 1}$, the conditions are:\n(a) $M'' = M' \\pm 1$, which implies $\\Delta M = \\pm 1$.\n(b) $|J' - 1| \\le J'' \\le J' + 1$, which again implies $\\Delta J = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nCombining these results, the preliminary selection rules are $\\Delta J = 0, \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta M = 0, \\pm 1$. However, we must also consider parity. The wavefunction $Y_J^M$ has a parity of $(-1)^J$. The dipole operator $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is a vector and has odd parity, $(-1)^1$. For the integral $\\langle \\Psi_f | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\Psi_i \\rangle$ to be non-zero, the integrand as a whole must have even parity. The parity of the integrand is:\n$$\n\\text{Parity} = (\\text{Parity of } \\Psi_f^*) \\times (\\text{Parity of } \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}) \\times (\\text{Parity of } \\Psi_i) = (-1)^{J''} \\times (-1)^1 \\times (-1)^{J'} = (-1)^{J'' - J' + 1}\n$$\nFor the integral to be non-zero, the parity must be even, so the exponent must be an even integer. This requires $J'' - J'$ to be an odd integer. Therefore, the case $\\Delta J = 0$ is forbidden.\nThe final selection rules for electric-dipole pure rotational transitions are:\n$$\n\\Delta J = \\pm 1 \\\\\n\\Delta M = 0, \\pm 1\n$$\nAdditionally, the permanent dipole moment must be non-zero ($\\mu_0 \\ne 0$), which is true for the specified heteronuclear molecule $XY$.\n\n2. Identification of Allowed Absorption Transition from $J=5$\nThe energy levels of a rigid rotor are given by $E_J = B_{rot} J(J+1)$, where $B_{rot} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant in energy units and $I$ is the moment of inertia. Since $B_{rot} > 0$, the energy increases with increasing $J$. An absorption transition involves moving from a lower energy level to a higher one. Therefore, for absorption, the final state $J''$ must have a higher energy than the initial state $J'$, which means $J'' > J'$. This requires $\\Delta J = J'' - J' = +1$.\nThe initial state is given as $J = 5$. Applying the selection rule $\\Delta J = +1$, the final state must be $J'' = 5 + 1 = 6$.\nThus, the only allowed pure rotational absorption transition from the $J=5$ level is the transition $J=5 \\to J=6$. The selection rule on $M$ allows transitions between the various degenerate sublevels, but in the absence of an external field, these all correspond to a single absorption line frequency.\n\n3. Computation of the Absorption Line Frequency\nThe frequency $\\nu$ of the absorbed photon is given by Planck's relation, $\\Delta E = h\\nu$. The energy difference $\\Delta E$ for the transition $J \\to J+1$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{J+1} - E_J = B_{rot} (J+1)(J+2) - B_{rot} J(J+1) = B_{rot} (J+1) [(J+2) - J] = 2 B_{rot} (J+1)\n$$\nSubstituting $B_{rot} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} = \\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 I}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 2 \\left(\\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 I}\\right) (J+1) = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2 I}(J+1)\n$$\nThe frequency is then $\\nu = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} = \\frac{h}{4\\pi^2 I}(J+1)$. It is more conventional to define the rotational constant in frequency units, $B = \\frac{h}{8\\pi^2 I}$. Then the frequency of the transition is $\\nu = 2B(J+1)$.\nFor the transition $J=5 \\to J=6$, the frequency is $\\nu = 2B(5+1) = 12B$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass $\\mu$ of the molecule:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \\frac{(24.0\\ \\mathrm{u})(40.0\\ \\mathrm{u})}{24.0\\ \\mathrm{u} + 40.0\\ \\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{960}{64.0}\\ \\mathrm{u} = 15.0\\ \\mathrm{u}\n$$\nConverting to SI units:\n$$\n\\mu = 15.0 \\times (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 2.4908085999 \\times 10^{-26}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the moment of inertia $I = \\mu r^2$.

The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is $I = \\mu_r r^2$, where $\\mu_r = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}$ is the reduced mass.\n\nThe unperturbed stationary states are the eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}_0$, which are the spherical harmonics $Y_{JM}(\\theta, \\phi)$, denoted by the kets $|J,M\\rangle$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n$$ E_J^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) = B J(J+1) $$\nwhere $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant. These energy levels are $(2J+1)$-fold degenerate with respect to the magnetic quantum number $M$.\n\nThe perturbation is the potential energy of the permanent electric dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in the uniform electric field $\\vec{\\mathcal{E}}$, which is directed along the laboratory $z$-axis:\n$$ \\hat{V} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{\\mathcal{E}} = - \\mu \\mathcal{E} \\cos\\theta $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the magnitude of the dipole moment (aligned with the molecular axis) and $\\theta$ is the angle between the molecular axis and the $z$-axis.\n\nAccording to time-independent perturbation theory, the energy correction to the state $|J,M\\rangle$ is given by a series expansion.\n\nThe first-order energy correction is the expectation value of the perturbation in the unperturbed state:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(1)} = \\langle J,M | \\hat{V} | J,M \\rangle = - \\mu\\mathcal{E} \\langle J,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle $$\nThe operator $\\cos\\theta$ has odd parity, while the probability density $|\\Psi_{JM}|^2 = |Y_{JM}|^2$ has even parity. The integral of an odd function over the entire symmetric domain (the unit sphere) is zero. Therefore, the matrix element $\\langle J,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle = 0$ for all $J$ and $M$. Consequently, the first-order Stark effect for a rigid rotor is zero:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(1)} = 0 $$\n\nThe second-order energy correction is given by the expression:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\sum_{J' \\neq J, M'} \\frac{|\\langle J',M' | \\hat{V} | J,M \\rangle|^2}{E_J^{(0)} - E_{J'}^{(0)}} $$\nThe sum runs over all states $|J',M'\\rangle$ excluding the state $|J,M\\rangle$ itself.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{V}$ and $E_J^{(0)}$, we have:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\sum_{J' \\neq J, M'} \\frac{|\\langle J',M' | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2}{B[J(J+1) - J'(J'+1)]} $$\n\nTo evaluate this sum, we must determine the matrix elements $\\langle J',M' | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle$. The operator $\\cos\\theta$ is proportional to the spherical harmonic $Y_{1,0}$. From the properties of angular momentum addition (Wigner-Eckart theorem), these matrix elements are non-zero only if the following selection rules are satisfied:\n$1$. $\\Delta J = J' - J = \\pm 1$. This arises from coupling angular momenta $J$ and $1$ to yield $J'$ ($|J-1| \\le J' \\le J+1$) and the parity requirement that $J'+1+J$ must be even, implying $J' \\ne J$.\n$2$. $\\Delta M = M' - M = 0$. This is because $\\cos\\theta$ (proportional to $Y_{1,0}$) carries zero projection of angular momentum onto the $z$-axis.\n\nThese selection rules drastically simplify the sum. For a given state $|J,M\\rangle$, only states $|J-1, M\\rangle$ and $|J+1, M\\rangle$ can contribute to the sum.\nThe sum becomes:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\left( \\frac{|\\langle J-1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2}{E_J^{(0)} - E_{J-1}^{(0)}} + \\frac{|\\langle J+1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2}{E_J^{(0)} - E_{J+1}^{(0)}} \\right) $$\nNote that for the ground state $J=0$, the term with $J-1$ does not exist.\n\nThe required squared matrix elements of $\\cos\\theta$ are standard results from angular momentum theory:\n$$ |\\langle J-1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{J^2 - M^2}{(2J-1)(2J+1)} $$\n$$ |\\langle J+1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{(J+1)^2 - M^2}{(2J+1)(2J+3)} $$\nThe energy denominators are:\n$$ E_J^{(0)} - E_{J-1}^{(0)} = B[J(J+1) - (J-1)J] = B[\nJ^2+J-J^2+J] = 2BJ $$\n$$ E_J^{(0)} - E_{J+1}^{(0)} = B[J(J+1) - (J+1)(J+2)] = B(J+1)[J-(J+2)] = -2B(J+1) $$\n\nWe now derive the specific formulas for two cases.\n\nCase 1: $J=0$ (and thus $M=0$)\nOnly the transition to $J'=1$ is possible.\n$$ \\Delta E_{00}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\frac{|\\langle 1,0 | \\cos\\theta | 0,0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_1^{(0)}} $$\nUsing the formula for $|\\langle J+1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2$ with $J=0, M=0$:\n$$ |\\langle 1,0 | \\cos\\theta | 0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{(0+1)^2 - 0^2}{(2(0)+1)(2(0)+3)} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe energy denominator is $E_0^{(0)} - E_1^{(0)} = -2B(0+1) = -2B$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta E_{00}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\frac{1/3}{-2B} = -\\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{6B} = -\\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 I}{3\\hbar^2} $$\n\nCase 2: $J \\geq 1$\nBoth transitions to $J-1$ and $J+1$ contribute.\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2BJ} \\frac{J^2 - M^2}{(2J-1)(2J+1)} + \\frac{1}{-2B(J+1)} \\frac{(J+1)^2 - M^2}{(2J+1)(2J+3)} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{2B(2J+1)} \\left( \\frac{J^2 - M^2}{J(2J-1)} - \\frac{(J+1)^2 - M^2}{(J+1)(2J+3)} \\right) $$\nTo simplify the expression in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{(J^2 - M^2)(J+1)(2J+3) - ((J+1)^2 - M^2)J(2J-1)}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\nThe numerator simplifies to $(2J+1)[J(J+1) - 3M^2]$.\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the final expression:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{2B(2J+1)} \\frac{(2J+1)[J(J+1) - 3M^2]}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{2B} \\frac{J(J+1) - 3M^2}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\nUsing $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 I}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{J(J+1) - 3M^2}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\n\nThe program will implement these two derived formulas. For each test case, it will first convert all input parameters to SI units. It will calculate the moment of inertia $I$. Then, based on the value of $J$, it will apply the appropriate formula to compute $\\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)}$ in Joules. A special check is included for nonpolar molecules ($\\mu=0$), for which the Stark shift is trivially zero.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and computes the quadratic Stark energy correction for a linear rigid rotor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (m1 [u], m2 [u], r [pm], mu [D], E [kV/cm], J, M)\n        (35.453, 1.00784, 127.45, 1.08, 50.0, 0, 0),\n        (12.000000, 15.994915, 112.83, 0.112, 100.0, 1, 0),\n        (14.003074, 14.003074, 109.76, 0.0, 200.0, 4, 2),\n        (1.00784, 18.998403, 91.70, 1.826, 25.0, 2, 2),\n    ]\n\n    # Physical constants in SI units\n    H_BAR = 1.054571817e-34      # J·s\n    U_TO_KG = 1.66053906660e-27  # kg/u\n    D_TO_CM = 3.33564e-30      # C·m/D\n    KV_CM_TO_V_M = 1.0e5       # (V/m) / (kV/cm)\n    PM_TO_M = 1.0e-12          # m/pm\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        m1_u, m2_u, r_pm, mu_D, E_kV_cm, J, M = case\n\n        # For nonpolar molecules, the Stark effect is zero.\n        if mu_D == 0.0:\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n\n        # Convert input parameters to SI units\n        m1 = m1_u * U_TO_KG\n        m2 = m2_u * U_TO_KG\n        r = r_pm * PM_TO_M\n        mu = mu_D * D_TO_CM\n        E_field = E_kV_cm * KV_CM_TO_V_M\n\n        # Calculate derived physical quantities\n        reduced_mass = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n        moment_of_inertia = reduced_mass * r**2\n\n        # Common factor in the energy shift expressions\n        prefactor = (mu * E_field)**2 * moment_of_inertia / (H_BAR**2)\n\n        energy_shift = 0.0\n        if J == 0:\n            # Formula for the ground state (J=0, M=0)\n            # ΔE = - (μE)²I / (3ħ²)\n            energy_shift = -prefactor / 3.0\n        else:\n            # Formula for excited states (J >= 1)\n            # ΔE = (μE)²I/ħ² * [J(J+1) - 3M²] / [J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)]\n            numerator = float(J * (J + 1) - 3 * M**2)\n            denominator = float(J * (J + 1) * (2 * J - 1) * (2 * J + 3))\n            \n            # Denominator is non-zero for integer J >= 1\n            energy_shift = prefactor * (numerator / denominator)\n            \n        results.append(energy_shift)\n\n    # Format the results as specified and print\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.10e}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2679582"}]}
