The joint probability for this sequence, $P_{B\\to A}(b_{+},a_{+})$, is calculated analogously.\n\nThe probability of obtaining outcome $b_{+}$ from measuring $\\hat{B}$ on the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is:\n$$P(b_{+}) = |\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2$$\nThe state then collapses to $|b_{+}\\rangle$. The probability of subsequently measuring $a_{+}$ for observable $\\hat{A}$ on the state $|b_{+}\\rangle$ is:\n$$P(a_{+}|b_{+}) = |\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle|^2$$\nThe joint probability for the sequence $B \\to A$ is:\n$$P_{B\\to A}(b_{+},a_{+}) = P(b_{+}) P(a_{+}|b_{+}) = |\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2 |\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle|^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the order-effect magnitude $\\Delta \\equiv P_{A\\to B}(a_{+},b_{+}) - P_{B\\to A}(b_{+},a_{+})$.\nSince the quantum mechanical inner product satisfies $|\\langle u|v\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle v|u\\rangle|^2$, we have $|\\langle b_{+}|a_{+}\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle|^2$. The expression for $\\Delta$ can thus be simplified by factoring out this common term:\n$$\\Delta = (|\\langle a_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2 - |\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2) |\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle|^2$$\nThis expression reveals that the order effect is proportional to the difference in the probabilities of obtaining the outcomes $a_{+}$ and $b_{+}$ from the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nWe now calculate the three terms in the expression for $\\Delta$ using the givens.\nThe initial state is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos\\gamma\\,|a_{+}\\rangle + \\exp(i\\delta)\\,\\sin\\gamma\\,|a_{-}\\rangle$.\nThe eigenbasis relationship is $|b_{+}\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\,|a_{+}\\rangle + \\sin(\\theta/2)\\,|a_{-}\\rangle$.\nThe given angles are $\\theta=\\pi/3$, $\\gamma=\\pi/3$, and $\\delta=\\pi/2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $|\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle|^2$:\nThe inner product $\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle$ is found using the orthonormality of the $\\{|a_+\\rangle, |a_-\\rangle\\}$ basis:\n$$\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle = \\langle a_{+}|(\\cos(\\theta/2)\\,|a_{+}\\rangle + \\sin(\\theta/2)\\,|a_{-}\\rangle) = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\langle a_{+}|a_{+}\\rangle + \\sin(\\theta/2)\\langle a_{+}|a_{-}\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2)$$\nWith $\\theta=\\pi/3$, we have $\\theta/2 = \\pi/6$.\n$$|\\langle a_{+}|b_{+}\\rangle|^2 = \\cos^2(\\pi/6) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate $|\\langle a_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2$:\n$$\\langle a_{+}|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle a_{+}|(\\cos\\gamma\\,|a_{+}\\rangle + \\exp(i\\delta)\\,\\sin\\gamma\\,|a_{-}\\rangle) = \\cos\\gamma\\langle a_{+}|a_{+}\\rangle + \\exp(i\\delta)\\,\\sin\\gamma\\langle a_{+}|a_{-}\\rangle = \\cos\\gamma$$\nWith $\\gamma=\\pi/3$:\n$$|\\langle a_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = \\cos^2(\\pi/3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThird, we calculate $|\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2$:\nWe form the inner product $\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle = (\\cos(\\theta/2)\\langle a_{+}| + \\sin(\\theta/2)\\langle a_{-}|) (\\cos\\gamma\\,|a_{+}\\rangle + \\exp(i\\delta)\\sin\\gamma\\,|a_{-}\\rangle)$$\n$$\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\cos\\gamma + \\exp(i\\delta)\\sin(\\theta/2)\\sin\\gamma$$\nNow we substitute the values $\\theta/2 = \\pi/6$, $\\gamma = \\pi/3$, and $\\delta = \\pi/2$:\n$$\\cos(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\pi/6) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n$$\\sin(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\pi/6) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\cos\\gamma = \\cos(\\pi/3) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\sin\\gamma = \\sin(\\pi/3) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n$$\\exp(i\\delta) = \\exp(i\\pi/2) = i$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + i\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(1+i)$$\nThe squared modulus is:\n$$|\\langle b_{+}|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = \\left|\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(1+i)\\right|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 |1+i|^2 = \\frac{3}{16}(1^2+1^2) = \\frac{3}{16}(2) = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{3}{8}\\right) \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\left(\\frac{2}{8} - \\frac{3}{8}\\right) \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\times \\frac{3}{4} = -\\frac{3}{32}$$\n\nThe non-zero value of $\\Delta$ is a direct consequence of the non-commutativity of the observables $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$ (i.e., $[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]\\neq 0$ for $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$). If the observables commuted, the measurement order would be irrelevant and $\\Delta$ would be zero. The sign of $\\Delta$ being negative indicates that for this specific initial state and choice of outcomes, the joint probability of the sequence $B \\to A$ is greater than that of the sequence $A \\to B$: $P_{B\\to A}(b_{+},a_{+}) > P_{A\\to B}(a_{+},b_{+})$. This difference arises because the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ has a higher probability of yielding outcome $b_{+}$ ($P(b_{+})=3/8$) than outcome $a_{+}$ ($P(a_{+})=1/4$), and this initial probability difference outweighs other factors in the calculation of the joint probabilities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{32}}$$", "id": "2661184"}]}
