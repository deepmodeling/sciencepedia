This exercise guides you to derive the condition for thermal equilibrium—the equality of temperature—directly from the fundamental postulate that an isolated system evolves to its state of maximum entropy.

The total energy is fixed at $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The microcanonical entropy of each system is defined by $S(E) = k_B \\ln \\Omega(E)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\Omega(E)$ is the density of states. The microcanonical temperature $T$ is defined by the fundamental thermodynamic relation $T^{-1} = \\left(\\partial S/\\partial E\\right)_{N,V}$.

It is a standard problem in statistical mechanics that uses fundamental principles correctly. Therefore, the problem is valid and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics for an isolated composite system is that the condition for equilibrium corresponds to the configuration that maximizes the total entropy. The composite system consists of two subsystems, A and B, which are in weak thermal contact, meaning they can exchange energy but are otherwise independent. The total system is isolated, so its total energy $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is conserved, with the constraint $E_A + E_B = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nBecause the subsystems are weakly interacting, the total density of states $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the product of the individual densities of states, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_A, E_B) = \\Omega_A(E_A) \\Omega_B(E_B)$. Consequently, the total entropy $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the sum of the individual entropies:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{tot}} = S_A + S_B = k_B \\ln \\Omega_A(E_A) + k_B \\ln \\Omega_B(E_B)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Using the energy conservation constraint, $E_B = E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - E_A$, the total entropy can be expressed as a function of a single variable, $E_A$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_A) = S_A(E_A) + S_B(E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - E_A)\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium energy partition, denoted by $E_A^{\\ast}$, we must find the value of $E_A$ that maximizes $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_A)$. This is achieved by setting the first derivative of $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ with respect to $E_A$ equal to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{d E_A} = \\frac{\\partial S_A}{\\partial E_A} + \\frac{\\partial S_B}{\\partial E_B} \\frac{d E_B}{d E_A} = 0\n$$\nSince $\\frac{d E_B}{d E_A} = \\frac{d}{d E_A}(E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - E_A) = -1$, the equilibrium condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_A}{\\partial E_A} - \\frac{\\partial S_B}{\\partial E_B} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial S_A}{\\partial E_A} = \\frac{\\partial S_B}{\\partial E_B}\n$$\nUsing the provided definition of microcanonical temperature, $T^{-1} = (\\partial S/\\partial E)_{N,V}$, this condition is equivalent to the equality of the temperatures of the two subsystems:\n$$\nT_A^{-1} = T_B^{-1} \\quad \\implies \\quad T_A = T_B\n$$\nThis result demonstrates a crucial concept: the statistical principle of entropy maximization for an isolated system implies the existence of a common intensive parameter—temperature—for subsystems in thermal equilibrium, which is the essence of the zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n\nNow, we apply this condition to the specific systems given.

System A requires $0 < E_A < E_{\\max} = 100\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$. System B requires $E_B > 0$, which means $E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - E_A > 0$, or $E_A < E_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$. The physically permissible range for $E_A$ is therefore $0 < E_A < 60\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$.\n\nThe first solution, $E_A^{(1)} \\approx 76.265\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$, is greater than $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and is therefore unphysical. It would imply a negative energy for system B, which is forbidden.\nThe second solution, $E_A^{(2)} \\approx 15.735\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$, lies within the physical range $0 < E_A < 60\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$. This is the correct equilibrium energy $E_A^{\\ast}$.\n\nTo confirm this corresponds to a maximum of entropy, we examine the sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{d^2 S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{d E_A^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_B}\\frac{d^2 S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{d E_A^2} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{E_A^2} - \\frac{\\beta}{(E_{\\max} - E_A)^2} - \\frac{\\gamma}{(E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - E_A)^2}\n$$\nAs $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ are all positive and the denominators are squared terms, this expression is strictly negative for any physically allowed $E_A$. Thus, the extremum found is indeed a maximum, and the equilibrium is stable.\n\nThe equilibrium energy for system A is $E_A^{\\ast} \\approx 15.73451\\,\\mathrm{kJ}$.
