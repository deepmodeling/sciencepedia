All computations must be done in SI units as specified above.", "solution": "The problem requires a quantitative demonstration of the distinction between state functions and path functions in thermodynamics. The system is one mole of a fluid, described by the van der Waals equation of state, transitioning between an initial state $(T_1, V_1)$ and a final state $(T_2, V_2)$. We are to compute the work done, $W$, heat exchanged, $Q$, and change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, for two distinct reversible paths, $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nA state function is a property of a system whose value depends solely on the current equilibrium state of the system, defined by variables like temperature $T$ and volume $V$. The change in a state function between two states is therefore independent of the path taken. Internal energy, $U$, is a canonical example of a state function. In contrast, path functions, such as work, $W$, and heat, $Q$, are quantities whose values depend on the specific sequence of intermediate states (the path) connecting the initial and final states. Our objective is to rigorously demonstrate that for the two specified paths, $\\Delta U$ is identical, whereas $W$ and $Q$ are different.\n\nThe entire analysis is based on the First Law of Thermodynamics, which, for a reversible process, is expressed infinitesimally as $dU = \\delta Q - \\delta W$. The sign convention specifies that $W$ is work done *by* the system, so $\\delta W = P\\,dV$. The problem considers one mole of a fluid governed by the van der Waals equation of state:\n$$\nP(T,V;a,b) = \\frac{R\\,T}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2}\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are empirical parameters, and $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nThe first step, as mandated, is to find the exact differential of internal energy, $dU$. As $U$ is a function of state variables $T$ and $V$, its total differential is:\n$$\ndU = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T dV\n$$\nThe first term contains the definition of the isochoric heat capacity, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V \\equiv C_V$. For this problem, $C_V$ is a given constant. To determine the second term, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T$, which represents the change in internal energy with volume at constant temperature (the internal pressure), we start from the fundamental thermodynamic relation $dU = T\\,dS - P\\,dV$. From this, we derive:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial V}\\right)_T - P\n$$\nUsing the Maxwell relation $\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$, we can express the internal pressure using the equation of state:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V - P\n$$\nFor the van der Waals equation, we compute the partial derivative:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{R\\,T}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2} \\right)_V = \\frac{R}{V - b}\n$$\nSubstituting this result yields the internal pressure:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left( \\frac{R}{V - b} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{R\\,T}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2} \\right) = \\frac{a}{V^2}\n$$\nThis is a standard result; the internal energy's dependence on volume in a van der Waals fluid arises from the intermolecular attractive forces parameterized by $a$. For an ideal gas ($a=0$), this term vanishes. The complete differential for the internal energy is therefore:\n$$\ndU = C_V dT + \\frac{a}{V^2} dV\n$$\nSince $U$ is a state function, its total change, $\\Delta U$, between states $(T_1, V_1)$ and $(T_2, V_2)$ is path-independent. We can calculate this change by integrating the exact differential $dU$:\n$$\n\\Delta U = \\int_{(T_1,V_1)}^{(T_2,V_2)} dU = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_V dT + \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{a}{V^2} dV\n$$\nAs $C_V$ is constant, this integration is straightforward:\n$$\n\\Delta U = C_V (T_2 - T_1) + a \\left[ -\\frac{1}{V} \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = C_V (T_2 - T_1) - a \\left( \\frac{1}{V_2} - \\frac{1}{V_1} \\right)\n$$\nThis single formula is sufficient to calculate $\\Delta U$ for every test case, as the result must be the same regardless of the path taken.\n\nWe now analyze the two specific paths to calculate the path-dependent quantities $W$ and $Q$.\n\nPath $\\mathcal{A}$: An isothermal step at $T_1$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$, followed by an isochoric step at $V_2$ from $T_1$ to $T_2$.\n1.  Isothermal process from $(T_1, V_1)$ to $(T_1, V_2)$: The work done by the system is the line integral of pressure, $W_{\\mathcal{A},1} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P(T_1, V) dV$.\n    $$\n    W_{\\mathcal{A},1} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\left( \\frac{R\\,T_1}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2} \\right) dV\n    $$\n2.  Isochoric process from $(T_1, V_2)$ to $(T_2, V_2)$: The work done is $W_{\\mathcal{A},2} = \\int_{V_2}^{V_2} P dV = 0$, as $dV=0$.\nThe total work for Path $\\mathcal{A}$ is $W_{\\mathcal{A}} = W_{\\mathcal{A},1}$. The heat exchanged is found from the First Law: $Q_{\\mathcal{A}} = \\Delta U + W_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n\nPath $\\mathcal{B}$: An isochoric step at $V_1$ from $T_1$ to $T_2$, followed by an isothermal step at $T_2$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$.\n1.  Isochoric process from $(T_1, V_1)$ to $(T_2, V_1)$: The work done is $W_{\\mathcal{B},1} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_1} P dV = 0$.\n2.  Isothermal process from $(T_2, V_1)$ to $(T_2, V_2)$: The work done is $W_{\\mathcal{B},2} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P(T_2, V) dV$.\n    $$\n    W_{\\mathcal{B},2} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\left( \\frac{R\\,T_2}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2} \\right) dV\n    $$\nThe total work for Path $\\mathcal{B}$ is $W_{\\mathcal{B}} = W_{\\mathcal{B},2}$. The heat exchanged is $Q_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\Delta U + W_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n\nSince $T_1 \\neq T_2$ (in general), the pressure function is different along the isothermal segments of the two paths. Consequently, we expect $W_{\\mathcal{A}} \\neq W_{\\mathcal{B}}$. Because $\\Delta U$ is the same for both paths, it necessarily follows that $Q_{\\mathcal{A}} \\neq Q_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n\nThe implementation proceeds as follows:\nFor each supplied test case $(a, b, C_V, T_1, V_1, T_2, V_2)$:\n1.  Calculate the single, path-independent value of $\\Delta U$ using the derived analytical formula.\n2.  Define the van der Waals pressure function $P(T,V)$.\n3.  Calculate $W_{\\mathcal{A}}$ by numerically integrating $P(T_1, V)$ with respect to $V$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$.\n4.  Calculate $Q_{\\mathcal{A}}$ from the First Law: $Q_{\\mathcal{A}} = \\Delta U + W_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\n5.  Calculate $W_{\\mathcal{B}}$ by numerically integrating $P(T_2, V)$ with respect to $V$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$.\n6.  Calculate $Q_{\\mathcal{B}}$ as $Q_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\Delta U + W_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n7.  The five results ($W_{\\mathcal{A}}$, $Q_{\\mathcal{A}}$, $W_{\\mathcal{B}}$, $Q_{\\mathcal{B}}$, $\\Delta U$) are collected. All numerical integrations are performed using the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library to satisfy the problem requirement.
