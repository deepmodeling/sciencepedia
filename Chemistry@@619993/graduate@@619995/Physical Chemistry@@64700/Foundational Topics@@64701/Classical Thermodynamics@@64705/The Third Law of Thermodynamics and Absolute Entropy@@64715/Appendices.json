This first practice takes you back to first principles to explore the statistical origin of this 'residual' entropy.

Assume that all lattice sites are energetically equivalent for A and B in the limit $T \\to 0$, that the vibrational degrees of freedom are in their ground states so that excitations do not contribute, and that the only source of degeneracy at $T \\to 0$ is the substitutional arrangement of the isotopes on the sites. The solid is a macroscopically large, ergodically inaccessible, quenched random arrangement consistent with its low-temperature equilibrium composition. \n\nStarting from the Boltzmann definition of entropy $S = k_{B} \\ln W$ and a combinatorial count of the number of distinguishable configurations $W$ of isotopes on the lattice, derive the molar residual entropy per mole of lattice sites, $S_{\\mathrm{res},m}$, as a function of $x$ in the thermodynamic limit. Then evaluate this residual molar entropy for the equimolar case $x = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Express your final numerical result in $\\text{J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in physical chemistry that is solvable using fundamental principles of statistical mechanics.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the molar residual entropy, $S_{\\mathrm{res},m}$, for a binary isotopic mixture on a lattice. The foundation of this derivation is the Boltzmann definition of entropy, which relates entropy $S$ to the number of accessible microstates $W$ of a system:\n$$S = k_{B} \\ln W$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe problem specifies that at a temperature $T \\to 0$, the only source of entropy is the configurational degeneracy arising from the random arrangement of the two isotopes, $A$ and $B$, on $N$ lattice sites. We are given that there are $N_A = xN$ atoms of isotope $A$ and $N_B = (1-x)N$ atoms of isotope $B$, where $x$ is the molar fraction of isotope $A$ and $N$ is the total number of lattice sites.\n\nThe number of distinguishable configurations, $W$, is the number of ways to arrange $N_A$ identical items of type $A$ and $N_B$ identical items of type $B$ on $N = N_A + N_B$ distinct sites. This is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$W = \\binom{N}{N_A} = \\frac{N!}{N_A! N_B!}$$\nSubstituting this into Boltzmann's entropy formula gives:\n$$S = k_{B} \\ln \\left( \\frac{N!}{N_A! N_B!} \\right) = k_{B} (\\ln(N!) - \\ln(N_A!) - \\ln(N_B!))$$\nSince the solid is macroscopic, the number of atoms $N$, $N_A$, and $N_B$ are very large. We can therefore apply Stirling's approximation for the natural logarithm of a factorial, $\\ln(n!) \\approx n \\ln n - n$ for large $n$. Applying this to each factorial term:\n$$ \\ln(N!) \\approx N \\ln N - N $$\n$$ \\ln(N_A!) \\approx N_A \\ln N_A - N_A $$\n$$ \\ln(N_B!) \\approx N_B \\ln N_B - N_B $$\nSubstituting these approximations into the expression for entropy $S$:\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ (N \\ln N - N) - (N_A \\ln N_A - N_A) - (N_B \\ln N_B - N_B) \\right] $$\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - N_A \\ln N_A - N_B \\ln N_B - (N - N_A - N_B) \\right] $$\nSince $N = N_A + N_B$, the term $(N - N_A - N_B)$ equals $0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - N_A \\ln N_A - N_B \\ln N_B \\right] $$\nNow, we express $N_A$ and $N_B$ in terms of the total number of sites $N$ and the mole fraction $x$: $N_A = xN$ and $N_B = (1-x)N$.\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - (xN) \\ln(xN) - ((1-x)N) \\ln((1-x)N) \\right] $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(ab) = \\ln a + \\ln b$:\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - xN(\\ln x + \\ln N) - (1-x)N(\\ln(1-x) + \\ln N) \\right] $$\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ N \\ln N - xN \\ln x - xN \\ln N - (1-x)N \\ln(1-x) - (1-x)N \\ln N \\right] $$\nWe can group the terms containing $\\ln N$:\n$$ S \\approx k_{B} \\left[ (N - xN - (1-x)N) \\ln N - xN \\ln x - (1-x)N \\ln(1-x) \\right] $$\nThe term multiplying $\\ln N$ is $N - xN - N + xN = 0$. This leaves:\n$$ S = -N k_{B} \\left[ x \\ln x + (1-x) \\ln(1-x) \\right] $$\nThis is the total residual entropy of the system of $N$ sites. The problem asks for the molar residual entropy, $S_{\\mathrm{res},m}$, which is the entropy per mole of lattice sites. The number of moles of lattice sites is $n = N/N_{A}$, where $N_{A}$ is Avogadro's constant.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m} = \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{-N k_{B} \\left[ x \\ln x + (1-x) \\ln(1-x) \\right]}{N/N_{A}} $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m} = -N_{A} k_{B} \\left[ x \\ln x + (1-x) \\ln(1-x) \\right] $$\nThe product of Avogadro's constant and Boltzmann's constant is the universal gas constant, $R = N_{A} k_{B}$. Thus, the molar residual entropy as a function of composition $x$ is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m}(x) = -R \\left[ x \\ln x + (1-x) \\ln(1-x) \\right] $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part requires evaluating this expression for the equimolar case, where $x = \\frac{1}{2}$, or $x = 0.5$.\nSubstituting $x = 0.5$ into the derived formula:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m}(0.5) = -R \\left[ 0.5 \\ln(0.5) + (1-0.5) \\ln(0.5) \\right] $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m}(0.5) = -R \\left[ 0.5 \\ln(0.5) + 0.5 \\ln(0.5) \\right] = -R \\ln(0.5) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\ln(2)$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m}(0.5) = -R (-\\ln(2)) = R \\ln(2) $$\nTo find the numerical value, we use the value of the universal gas constant $R \\approx 8.314462618 \\, \\text{J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$ and the value of $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718056$.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m}(0.5) \\approx (8.314462618 \\, \\text{J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (0.69314718056) $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{res},m}(0.5) \\approx 5.76281 \\, \\text{J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
