It is a standard problem in physical chemistry that correctly tests the understanding of the First Law of Thermodynamics and its application beyond simple pressure-volume work. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as specified.\n\n**Task 1: Theoretical Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the differential form of the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system. According to the specified sign convention where work done by the system is positive, the law is written as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}U = \\delta Q - \\delta W\n$$\nHere, $\\mathrm{d}U$ is the infinitesimal change in the internal energy of the system, $\\delta Q$ is the infinitesimal heat added to the system, and $\\delta W$ is the infinitesimal work done by the system on its surroundings.\n\nThe total work done by the system, $\\delta W$, can be decomposed into two components: pressure-volume work, $\\delta W_{PV}$, and any other form of work, which we shall denote as non-pressure-volume work, $\\delta W_{non-PV}$. In this problem, this is specified as electrical work.\n$$\n\\delta W = \\delta W_{PV} + \\delta W_{non-PV}\n$$\nFor a process carried out quasi-statically, the internal pressure of the system, $p$, is equal to the constant external pressure, $p_{ext}$. The pressure-volume work is therefore given by $\\delta W_{PV} = p \\ \\mathrm{d}V$. Substituting this into the expression for total work gives:\n$$\n\\delta W = p \\ \\mathrm{d}V + \\delta W_{non-PV}\n$$\nSubstituting this expanded form of $\\delta W$ back into the First Law yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}U = \\delta Q - (p \\ \\mathrm{d}V + \\delta W_{non-PV})\n$$\nThe definition of enthalpy, $H$, is:\n$$\nH \\equiv U + pV\n$$\nTaking the total differential of this definition gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = \\mathrm{d}U + \\mathrm{d}(pV)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation on the $pV$ term, we have $\\mathrm{d}(pV) = p \\ \\mathrm{d}V + V \\ \\mathrm{d}p$. Thus, the expression for $\\mathrm{d}H$ becomes:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = \\mathrm{d}U + p \\ \\mathrm{d}V + V \\ \\mathrm{d}p\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\mathrm{d}U$ from the First Law into this equation for $\\mathrm{d}H$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = (\\delta Q - p \\ \\mathrm{d}V - \\delta W_{non-PV}) + p \\ \\mathrm{d}V + V \\ \\mathrm{d}p\n$$\nThe terms $-p \\ \\mathrm{d}V$ and $+p \\ \\mathrm{d}V$ cancel, simplifying the equation to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = \\delta Q - \\delta W_{non-PV} + V \\ \\mathrm{d}p\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the process occurs at constant external pressure. Since the process is quasi-static, the system pressure $p$ is constant, and therefore its differential $\\mathrm{d}p$ is zero. Under this condition, the heat exchanged is denoted as $\\delta Q_{p}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}H = \\delta Q_{p} - \\delta W_{non-PV}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express $\\delta Q_{p}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{d}H$ and $\\delta W_{non-PV}$:\n$$\n\\delta Q_{p} = \\mathrm{d}H + \\delta W_{non-PV}\n$$\nThis is the general relation required. It demonstrates that the heat transferred at constant pressure, $\\delta Q_{p}$, is equal to the change in enthalpy, $\\mathrm{d}H$, if and only if the non-pressure-volume work is zero ($\\delta W_{non-PV} = 0$). If the system performs non-PV work on its surroundings, such that $\\delta W_{non-PV} > 0$, then $\\delta Q_{p}$ will be greater than $\\mathrm{d}H$ by the amount of non-PV work done. This establishes the counterexample showing the failure of the equality $\\delta Q_{p} = \\mathrm{d}H$ when non-PV work is present.\n\n**Task 2: Quantitative Calculation**\n\nThe second task is to compute the numerical value of the discrepancy $D \\equiv Q_{p} - \\Delta H$ for a specific process. For a finite process occurring at constant pressure, we integrate the relationship derived in Task 1:\n$$\n\\int \\delta Q_{p} = \\int \\mathrm{d}H + \\int \\delta W_{non-PV}\n$$\nThis integration results in:\n$$\nQ_{p} = \\Delta H + W_{non-PV}\n$$\nwhere $Q_{p}$ is the total heat transferred at constant pressure, $\\Delta H$ is the total change in enthalpy, and $W_{non-PV}$ is the total non-pressure-volume work done by the system.\n\nThe discrepancy $D$ is defined as $D = Q_{p} - \\Delta H$. From the equation above, it is clear that this discrepancy is precisely equal to the non-pressure-volume work done by the system:\n$$\nD = W_{non-PV}\n$$\nFor the given galvanic fuel cell, the non-PV work is the electrical work, $W_{elec}$, performed by the cell on an external circuit. The process is described as reversible, so the electrical work can be calculated from the cell's electromotive force (EMF), $E$. The work done by the system is given by the product of the total charge transferred and the cell potential:\n$$\nW_{elec} = nFE\n$$\nHere, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred per mole of reaction, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $E$ is the EMF of the cell.\n\nThe problem provides the following values for the reaction of $1.000$ mol of $\\mathrm{H_2}$:\n- Moles of electrons transferred, $n = 2$ mol (this is an exact stoichiometric number for the reaction $\\mathrm{H_2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\mathrm{H_2O}$).\n- Faraday constant, $F = 96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\ mol^{-1}}$.\n- Electromotive force, $E = 1.229 \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nWe calculate the electrical work, which is equal to the discrepancy $D$.

We convert joules to kilojoules by dividing by $1000$:\n$$\nD = 237.15913 \\ \\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\nFinally, we must round the result to four significant figures, as this is the precision of the given EMF value ($1.229 \\ \\mathrm{V}$), which is the least precise value used in the calculation.\n$$\nD \\approx 237.2 \\ \\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\nThe provided value for the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^{\\circ} = -285.83 \\ \\mathrm{kJ \\ mol^{-1}}$, serves as context but is not required for the calculation of the discrepancy $D = W_{elec}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{237.2}$$", "id": "2638043"}, {"introduction": "Thermochemical properties like the enthalpy of vaporization, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$, are temperature-dependent.

The derivation must originate from fundamental principles.\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy $U$ is $dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$. For a reversible process at constant external pressure $p$, the work done on the system is $\\delta w = -p\\,dV$. Thus, $dU = \\delta q - p\\,dV$.\n\nEnthalpy, $H$, is defined as $H = U + pV$.

At constant pressure, $dp = 0$, which simplifies $dH$ to $dH_p = \\delta q_p$. This shows that the change in enthalpy at constant pressure is equal to the heat absorbed by the system.\n\nThe molar constant-pressure heat capacity, $C_p$, is defined as the partial derivative of molar enthalpy with respect to temperature at constant pressure: $C_p = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\right)_p$. For a finite change in temperature from $T_a$ to $T_b$ at constant pressure, the change in enthalpy is given by the integral $\\Delta H = \\int_{T_a}^{T_b} C_p(T) \\, dT$. This integral represents a \"sensible heat\" term, as it corresponds to a change in temperature without a phase transition.\n\nTo relate the enthalpy of vaporization at two different temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$, we construct a thermodynamic cycle.

One mole of liquid is vaporized at a constant temperature $T_1$ and pressure $p$. The enthalpy change is $\\Delta H_1 = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}(T_1)$.\n    $$\\text{Liquid}(T_1, p) \\xrightarrow{\\Delta H_1} \\text{Vapor}(T_1, p)$$\n2.
