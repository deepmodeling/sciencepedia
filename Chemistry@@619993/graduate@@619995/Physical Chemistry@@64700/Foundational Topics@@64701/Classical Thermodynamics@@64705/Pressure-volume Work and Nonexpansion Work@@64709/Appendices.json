Examine the case $n=\\gamma$ for a reversible adiabatic transformation of an ideal gas.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it deals with fundamental concepts of thermodynamics, namely pressure-volume work and polytropic processes, which are standard models in physical chemistry and engineering. It is well-posed, providing a specific path ($pV^n = \\text{const}$) for which a path-dependent quantity (work) is to be calculated. The problem is objective, using precise, universally accepted scientific terminology. It does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The constraints are clear and consistent. The requirement to analyze limiting cases serves as a verification of the derived formula against well-known results, which is a standard practice in physics. The problem is a non-trivial but standard exercise in thermodynamics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe mechanical expansion work, $w$, done on a closed system is defined by the integral of the external pressure, $p_{\\text{ext}}$, over the change in volume, $V$. The sign convention in physical chemistry defines work done *on* the system as positive.\n$$\ndw = -p_{\\text{ext}} dV\n$$\nThus, the total work for a finite transformation from an initial volume $V_i$ to a final volume $V_f$ is given by the path integral:\n$$\nw = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} p_{\\text{ext}} dV\n$$\nThe problem states that the process is reversible and quasi-static. For such a process, the system is always in a state of mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings. This means the external pressure $p_{\\text{ext}}$ is at all times equal to the internal pressure $p$ of the fluid. Therefore, we can replace $p_{\\text{ext}}$ with $p$ in the integral:\n$$\nw = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} p dV\n$$\nThe path of the transformation is specified as polytropic, following the equation $pV^n = C$, where $C$ is a constant and the polytropic exponent $n$ is a fixed value such that $n \\neq 1$. From this relation, we can express the pressure $p$ as a function of volume $V$:\n$$\np(V) = C V^{-n}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ can be determined from the initial state of the system $(p_i, V_i)$, as this state must lie on the process path.\n$$\nC = p_i V_i^n\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ and the function $p(V)$ into the work integral, we obtain:\n$$\nw = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} (p_i V_i^n) V^{-n} dV\n$$\nSince $p_i$, $V_i$, and $n$ are constants for the integration, we can move the term $p_i V_i^n$ outside the integral:\n$$\nw = -p_i V_i^n \\int_{V_i}^{V_f} V^{-n} dV\n$$\nThe integral of $V^{-n}$ with respect to $V$ is $\\frac{V^{-n+1}}{-n+1}$. This step is valid precisely because the problem specifies $n \\neq 1$, which prevents division by zero. Performing the definite integration:\n$$\nw = -p_i V_i^n \\left[ \\frac{V^{1-n}}{1-n} \\right]_{V_i}^{V_f} = -p_i V_i^n \\left( \\frac{V_f^{1-n} - V_i^{1-n}}{1-n} \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the negative sign into the denominator:\n$$\nw = p_i V_i^n \\left( \\frac{V_f^{1-n} - V_i^{1-n}}{n-1} \\right) = \\frac{p_i V_i^n V_f^{1-n} - p_i V_i^n V_i^{1-n}}{n-1}\n$$\nThe second term in the numerator simplifies to $p_i V_i^n V_i^{1-n} = p_i V_i^{n+1-n} = p_i V_i$. For the first term, we use the fact that the final state $(p_f, V_f)$ must also satisfy the polytropic relation $pV^n=C$. Thus, $p_f V_f^n = C = p_i V_i^n$. We can substitute this into the first term:\n$$\np_i V_i^n V_f^{1-n} = (p_f V_f^n) V_f^{1-n} = p_f V_f^{n+1-n} = p_f V_f\n$$\nSubstituting these simplified terms back into the expression for work gives the final closed-form result:\n$$\nw = \\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{n-1}\n$$\nThis expression is the mechanical expansion work for any reversible polytropic process with exponent $n \\neq 1$.\n\nNow, we examine the limiting cases as required.\n\nCase 1: The limit $n \\to 1$ for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible isothermal process.\nThe derived formula is indeterminate ($0/0$ form) if we directly substitute $n=1$, as for an ideal gas in an isothermal process, $pV = n_{\\text{gas}}RT = \\text{const}$, which means $p_iV_i = p_fV_f$. To evaluate the limit, we return to an intermediate form of the work expression:\n$$\nw = \\frac{p_i V_i^n V_f^{1-n} - p_i V_i}{n-1} = p_i V_i \\frac{(V_f/V_i)^{1-n} - 1}{n-1} = - p_i V_i \\frac{(V_f/V_i)^{1-n} - 1}{1-n}\n$$\nLet $x = V_f/V_i$ and $a = 1-n$. As $n \\to 1$, we have $a \\to 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nw = -p_i V_i \\lim_{a \\to 0} \\frac{x^a - 1}{a}\n$$\nThis limit is the definition of the derivative of the function $f(a) = x^a$ with respect to $a$, evaluated at $a=0$. The derivative is $f'(a) = x^a \\ln(x)$. At $a=0$, $f'(0) = x^0 \\ln(x) = \\ln(x)$.\nTherefore, the work in the limit $n \\to 1$ is:\n$$\nw_{n \\to 1} = -p_i V_i \\ln(x) = -p_i V_i \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)\n$$\nFor an ideal gas, $p_i V_i = n_{\\text{gas}} R T_i$. Since the process is isothermal, $T_i = T$.\n$$\nw_{\\text{isothermal}} = -n_{\\text{gas}} R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the correct, standard expression for the work of reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, which confirms the validity of our general formula in this limit.\n\nCase 2: The reversible adiabatic transformation of an ideal gas ($n = \\gamma$).\nFor an ideal gas, a reversible adiabatic process follows the path $pV^{\\gamma} = \\text{const}$, where $\\gamma = C_p/C_v$ is the heat capacity ratio. This is a polytropic process with $n=\\gamma$. We can directly apply our derived formula:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{\\gamma - 1}\n$$\nThe problem asks to relate this to state functions. For an ideal gas, the equation of state is $pV = n_{\\text{gas}}RT$. Substituting this into the work expression:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{gas}}RT_f - n_{\\text{gas}}RT_i}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{n_{\\text{gas}}R(T_f - T_i)}{\\gamma-1}\n$$\nFor an ideal gas, the universal gas constant $R$ is related to the molar heat capacities by Mayer's relation, $R = C_p - C_v$. Also, $\\gamma = C_p / C_v$, which implies $C_p = \\gamma C_v$. Substituting this gives $R = \\gamma C_v - C_v = C_v(\\gamma-1)$.\nWe substitute this expression for $R$ back into the work formula:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{gas}}C_v(\\gamma-1)(T_f - T_i)}{\\gamma-1} = n_{\\text{gas}}C_v(T_f - T_i)\n$$\nThe change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, for any process involving an ideal gas with a constant heat capacity $C_v$ is given by $\\Delta U = n_{\\text{gas}} C_v \\Delta T = n_{\\text{gas}}C_v(T_f - T_i)$.\nTherefore, we find that for this process:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\Delta U\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics, $\\Delta U = q + w$. For an adiabatic process, the heat transfer $q$ is zero ($q=0$), so the First Law reduces to $\\Delta U = w$. Our derivation correctly shows that the work done on the system is equal to the change in its internal energy, a state function. This further validates the derived expression for work.\nNonexpansion work, $w_{\\text{non-exp}}$, if present, would contribute to the change in internal energy alongside expansion work and heat, as per the full First Law: $\\Delta U = q + w_{\\text{exp}} + w_{\\text{non-exp}}$. This problem, however, focuses only on the mechanical expansion work component, $w = w_{\\text{exp}}$.\nThe derived expression $w = \\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{n-1}$ is general for any fluid undergoing a reversible polytropic process, not only for ideal gases. The analysis of the ideal gas cases simply serves as a powerful consistency check.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{n-1}}\n$$", "id": "2661834"}, {"introduction": "While the ideal gas model provides a useful starting point, real gases exhibit fascinating behaviors due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular size.

Let $\\bar{C}_{p,i}(T)$ denote the molar isobaric heat capacity of vented species $i$, and let $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T)$ and $p^\\star(T)$ denote the solvent’s molar enthalpy of vaporization and saturation vapor pressure at temperature $T$, respectively.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct under the stated assumptions.\n\nA. In an idealized case with no nonexpansion work and no mass exchange across the calorimeter boundary (i.e., no gas or solvent leave), the constant-pressure calorimetric measurement obeys $q_{\\text{meas}} = - \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.\n\nB. If nonexpansion work $w_{\\text{nonexp}}$ is performed on the reacting system (e.g., by an imposed electrical current), but there is still no mass exchange across the boundary, then at constant pressure the measured heat satisfies $q_{\\text{meas}} = - \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} + w_{\\text{nonexp}}$.\n\nC. If $\\Delta n_{\\text{g}}$ moles of an ideal gas are produced and vented, one must add a $P \\Delta V = \\Delta n_{\\text{g}} R T_f$ term to $q_{\\text{meas}}$ in order to recover $- \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.\n\nD. When gas products are vented but solvent evaporation is negligible, the sensible enthalpy carried away by the vented gas is approximately $\\sum_i n_i \\int_{T_i}^{T_f} \\bar{C}_{p,i}(T)\\, dT$, where $n_i$ is the number of moles of vented species $i$, and this contribution must be added to $q_{\\text{meas}}$ to obtain $- \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.\n\nE. If the vented gas stream is saturated with solvent vapor at $T_f$, and $n_{\\text{dry}}$ moles of dry gas (excluding solvent) are vented at total pressure $P$, then the expected solvent moles evaporated are $n_{\\text{vap}} = \\dfrac{p^\\star(T_f)}{P - p^\\star(T_f)}\\, n_{\\text{dry}}$, and the corresponding evaporative correction that must be added to $q_{\\text{meas}}$ to estimate $- \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$ is approximately $n_{\\text{vap}}\\, \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T_f)$ (with small additional sensible terms obtainable from heat capacities if needed).\n\nChoose all that apply: A, B, C, D, E.", "solution": "The problem statement describing a coffee-cup calorimetry experiment with potential non-idealities is presented. A validation of the problem statement is required before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System:** A well-stirred coffee-cup calorimeter.\n- **Process Conditions:** Constant atmospheric pressure $P$; effectively adiabatic with respect to the external laboratory; initial uniform temperature $T_i$; a chemical reaction occurs leading to a final uniform temperature $T_f$.\n- **Mass Exchange:** The calorimeter is vented at pressure $P$; gas products and evaporated solvent may leave.\n- **Work:** No nonexpansion work unless specified ($w_{\\text{nonexp}}$). Pressure-volume work occurs.\n- **Measurement:** The measured heat is $q_{\\text{meas}}$, defined as the heat gained by the calorimeter plus the remaining liquid solution.

The physical setup, a vented coffee-cup calorimeter, is a standard apparatus in physical chemistry. The non-idealities described (gas evolution, solvent evaporation) are realistic complications in such experiments. All definitions and symbols are standard. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The task is to evaluate a series of statements based on a defined physical scenario and fundamental principles. A unique and logical analysis of each statement is possible. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology, with one minor exception (\"idealized case\" in option A) which is acceptable in the context of isolating specific physical effects.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained and provides the necessary definitions and conditions to construct a thermodynamic model. There are no manifest contradictions. The definition of $\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$ as \"for the process as written in the calorimeter\" suggests a non-isothermal enthalpy change from state $(T_i)$ to state $(T_f)$, which is an unusual but not invalid definition for the purpose of a self-contained problem. Similarly, the definition of $q_{\\text{meas}}$ is unusually specific but clear.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is not metaphorical, trivial, or unrealistic. It requires a careful application of thermodynamic principles, particularly for open systems at constant pressure.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous analysis of the thermodynamic relationships and evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe foundation of calorimetry at constant pressure is the first law of thermodynamics, specialized for this condition. For any process occurring in an adiabatic, constant-pressure enclosure, the total change in enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\text{total}}$, must equal the non-expansion work, $w_{\\text{nonexp}}$, done on the system.\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{total}} = w_{\\text{nonexp}} $$\nThe total enthalpy change is the sum of the enthalpy changes of all components: the reaction itself, the calorimeter hardware, the solvent, and any mass that is vented. A more intuitive approach is an energy balance: the energy released by the process must equal the energy absorbed by various sinks or carried away.\n\nLet the energy released by the chemical transformation be $-\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$. Non-expansion work done on the system, $w_{\\text{nonexp}}$, is another energy source. This total available energy, $-\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} + w_{\\text{nonexp}}$, is distributed among several sinks:\n$1$. Heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the remaining liquid solution: this is defined as $q_{\\text{meas}}$.\n$2$. Heat absorbed by any products that are not part of the remaining liquid solution (e.g., solid precipitates): $\\Delta H_{\\text{prods,other}}$.\n$3$. Enthalpy carried away by vented species. This has two components:\n    a. Sensible heat: the energy associated with the vented material leaving at $T_f$ rather than $T_i$. Let this be $\\Delta H_{\\text{sens}}$.\n    b. Latent heat: the energy required for phase changes, such as solvent evaporation. Let this be $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$.\n\nThe general energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$ -\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} + w_{\\text{nonexp}} = q_{\\text{meas}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{prods,other}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{sens}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} $$\nRearranging for the measured quantity gives:\n$$ q_{\\text{meas}} = -\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} + w_{\\text{nonexp}} - (\\Delta H_{\\text{prods,other}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{sens}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}) $$\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on this framework.\n\n**A. In an idealized case with no nonexpansion work and no mass exchange across the calorimeter boundary (i.e., no gas or solvent leave), the constant-pressure calorimetric measurement obeys $q_{\\text{meas}} = - \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.**\n\nIn this case, $w_{\\text{nonexp}} = 0$ and there is no mass exchange, so $\\Delta H_{\\text{sens}} = 0$ and $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = 0$. The energy balance equation simplifies to $q_{\\text{meas}} = -\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{prods,other}}$. The statement claims $q_{\\text{meas}} = -\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$. This is only true if $\\Delta H_{\\text{prods,other}} = 0$. This condition holds if no new phases (like solids or internal gas bubbles) are formed, or if their heat capacities are negligible. The term \"idealized case\" must be interpreted as implying this condition. With this reasonable interpretation, the statement holds. This relationship, $\\Delta H = q_p$, where $q_p = -q_{\\text{meas}}$, is the cornerstone of simple constant-pressure calorimetry for closed systems.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If nonexpansion work $w_{\\text{nonexp}}$ is performed on the reacting system (e.g., by an imposed electrical current), but there is still no mass exchange across the boundary, then at constant pressure the measured heat satisfies $q_{\\text{meas}} = - \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} + w_{\\text{nonexp}}$.**\n\nThis scenario is similar to A, but with $w_{\\text{nonexp}} \\neq 0$. Again, no mass exchange implies $\\Delta H_{\\text{sens}} = 0$ and $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = 0$. Assuming, as in A, that $\\Delta H_{\\text{prods,other}} = 0$, our energy balance equation becomes $q_{\\text{meas}} = -\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} + w_{\\text{nonexp}}$. This matches the statement precisely. The non-expansion work acts as an additional energy input, which contributes to the heating of the calorimeter contents, thereby increasing $q_{\\text{meas}}$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. If $\\Delta n_{\\text{g}}$ moles of an ideal gas are produced and vented, one must add a $P \\Delta V = \\Delta n_{\\text{g}} R T_f$ term to $q_{\\text{meas}}$ in order to recover $- \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect as it fundamentally confuses the relationship between internal energy change ($\\Delta U$) and enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$). For a process at constant pressure, the heat exchanged, $q_p$, is equal to the enthalpy change, $\\Delta H$. The enthalpy is defined as $H = U + PV$. The change $\\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta(PV)$ already accounts for the pressure-volume work. For a reaction producing $\\Delta n_{\\text{g}}$ moles of gas at constant temperature and pressure, $\\Delta H = \\Delta U + P\\Delta V = \\Delta U + \\Delta n_{\\text{g}} R T$. A coffee-cup calorimeter, operating at constant pressure, is designed to measure $q_p$, which is directly related to $\\Delta H$, not $\\Delta U$. Therefore, one does not add a $P\\Delta V$ term to a constant-pressure heat measurement to find $\\Delta H$. The actual correction needed for vented gas is for the sensible heat it carries away, as described in option D.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. When gas products are vented but solvent evaporation is negligible, the sensible enthalpy carried away by the vented gas is approximately $\\sum_i n_i \\int_{T_i}^{T_f} \\bar{C}_{p,i}(T)\\, dT$, where $n_i$ is the number of moles of vented species $i$, and this contribution must be added to $q_{\\text{meas}}$ to obtain $- \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies a key correction required in open-system calorimetry. When a substance is created or exists at $T_i$ but exits the system at $T_f$, it carries away an amount of thermal energy, known as sensible heat. The expression for this enthalpy change for $n_i$ moles of species $i$ is precisely $\\Delta H_{sens, i} = n_i \\int_{T_i}^{T_f} \\bar{C}_{p,i}(T)\\, dT$. This represents an energy \"loss\" from the calorimeter that is not registered by the temperature sensor as part of $q_{\\text{meas}}$. To perform a complete energy balance and determine the total energy released by the reaction ($-\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$), this loss term must be added back to the measured heat. The proposed relation, $-\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} \\approx q_{\\text{meas}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{sens}}$, is consistent with our general energy balance (ignoring other effects).\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. If the vented gas stream is saturated with solvent vapor at $T_f$, and $n_{\\text{dry}}$ moles of dry gas (excluding solvent) are vented at total pressure $P$, then the expected solvent moles evaporated are $n_{\\text{vap}} = \\dfrac{p^\\star(T_f)}{P - p^\\star(T_f)}\\, n_{\\text{dry}}$, and the corresponding evaporative correction that must be added to $q_{\\text{meas}}$ to estimate $- \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$ is approximately $n_{\\text{vap}}\\, \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T_f)$ (with small additional sensible terms obtainable from heat capacities if needed).**\n\nThis statement consists of two parts.\nFirst, the calculation of evaporated solvent moles, $n_{\\text{vap}}$. According to Dalton's Law for an ideal gas mixture, the mole fraction of the vapor, $y_{\\text{vap}}$, is equal to the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure: $y_{\\text{vap}} = p^\\star(T_f) / P$. The mole fraction is also defined as $y_{\\text{vap}} = n_{\\text{vap}} / (n_{\\text{vap}} + n_{\\text{dry}})$. Equating the two expressions and solving for $n_{\\text{vap}}$ yields $n_{\\text{vap}} P = p^\\star(T_f) (n_{\\text{vap}} + n_{\\text{dry}})$, which rearranges to $n_{\\text{vap}}(P - p^\\star(T_f)) = n_{\\text{dry}} p^\\star(T_f)$, giving $n_{\\text{vap}} = \\dfrac{p^\\star(T_f)}{P - p^\\star(T_f)}\\, n_{\\text{dry}}$. The calculation is correct.\nSecond, the correction term. The evaporation of $n_{\\text{vap}}$ moles of solvent at temperature $T_f$ requires an energy input equal to the latent heat of vaporization, which is $n_{\\text{vap}} \\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}(T_f)$. This energy is drawn from the system, reducing the heat available to raise the temperature of the calorimeter contents. Thus, it is an energy loss unaccounted for in $q_{\\text{meas}}$. To recover $-\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$, this loss must be added to $q_{\\text{meas}}$. The statement correctly identifies this and notes that it is an approximation, with the full correction also including a sensible heat term for the vapor (as in option D), which is typically smaller. The logic is sound.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2661849"}]}
