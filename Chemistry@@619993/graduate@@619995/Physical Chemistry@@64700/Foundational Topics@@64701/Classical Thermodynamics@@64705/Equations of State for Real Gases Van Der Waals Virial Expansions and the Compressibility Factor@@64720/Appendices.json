This is related to the per-particle coefficient $B_2(T)$ by the Avogadro constant $N_{A}$:\n$$B(T) = N_{A} B_{2}(T)$$\nTherefore, the molar second virial coefficient for the hard-sphere gas is:\n$$B(T) = N_{A} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi N_{A} \\sigma^{3}$$\nAs noted, this quantity is independent of temperature.\n\nFor interpretation, we relate this result to the concept of excluded volume. For a pair of hard spheres, each of diameter $\\sigma$, their centers cannot approach each other closer than a distance $\\sigma$. This means that one sphere effectively excludes the center of the other sphere from a volume defined by a sphere of radius $\\sigma$. The volume of this excluded sphere is $V_{\\text{excl, pair}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$. The second virial coefficient per particle, $B_{2}(T)$, is exactly half of this pairwise excluded volume:\n$$B_{2}(T) = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\text{excl, pair}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$$\nThis confirms our calculation. This quantity can also be expressed in terms of the volume of a single hard-sphere particle, $V_{\\text{particle}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$. Then, $B_{2}(T) = 4V_{\\text{particle}}$. The molar second virial coefficient is thus $B(T) = N_{A} (4V_{\\text{particle}})$, which is four times the total volume of one mole of the particles themselves.\n\nFurthermore, we can compare this to the van der Waals equation of state, $(P + \\frac{a}{V_{m}^{2}})(V_{m} - b) = RT$. Expanding this for large $V_m$ (low density) yields the virial form $Z = 1 + \\frac{1}{V_{m}}\\left(b - \\frac{a}{RT}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(V_{m}^{-2})$. Comparing with the virial expansion, we identify the van der Waals second virial coefficient as $B_{2,\\text{vdW}}(T) = b - \\frac{a}{RT}$. The hard-sphere model has no attractive interactions, so the parameter $a$, which accounts for attractions, is zero ($a=0$). Thus, for a hard-sphere gas, the second virial coefficient should correspond to the van der Waals co-volume parameter $b$.

We construct a table to compute the required sums, $\\sum p_i^2$ and $\\sum p_i(Z_i - 1)$. There are $n=6$ data points.\n\n| $i$ | $p_i$ ($\\mathrm{bar}$) | $Z_i$ | $Z_i-1$ | $p_i^2$ ($\\mathrm{bar}^2$) | $p_i(Z_i-1)$ ($\\mathrm{bar}$) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $1$ | $0.5$ | $0.9970$ | $-0.0030$ | $0.25$ | $0.5 \\times (-0.0030) = -0.00150$ |\n| $2$ | $1.0$ | $0.9942$ | $-0.0058$ | $1.00$ | $1.0 \\times (-0.0058) = -0.00580$ |\n| $3$ | $1.5$ | $0.9915$ | $-0.0085$ | $2.25$ | $1.5 \\times (-0.0085) = -0.01275$ |\n| $4$ | $2.0$ | $0.9883$ | $-0.0117$ | $4.00$ | $2.0 \\times (-0.0117) = -0.02340$ |\n| $5$ | $3.0$ | $0.9827$ | $-0.0173$ | $9.00$ | $3.0 \\times (-0.0173) = -0.05190$ |\n| $6$ | $4.0$ | $0.9766$ | $-0.0234$ | $16.00$ | $4.0 \\times (-0.0234) = -0.09360$ |\n\nNow, we compute the sums:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_i^2 = 0.25 + 1.00 + 2.25 + 4.00 + 9.00 + 16.00 = 32.5\\ \\mathrm{bar}^2$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_i(Z_i - 1) = -0.00150 - 0.00580 - 0.01275 - 0.02340 - 0.05190 - 0.09360 = -0.18895\\ \\mathrm{bar}$$\nSubstituting these sums into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{-0.18895\\ \\mathrm{bar}}{32.5\\ \\mathrm{bar}^2} \\approx -0.005813846\\ \\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\alpha \\approx -5.81 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we interpret the sign of $\\alpha$.

Since the gas constant $R$ and the absolute temperature $T$ are always positive, the sign of $\\alpha$ is determined by the sign of $B(T)$.\nThe molar second virial coefficient, $B(T)$, quantifies the net effect of pairwise intermolecular interactions. A positive $B(T)$ indicates that repulsive forces are dominant, meaning molecules on average occupy a larger volume than predicted by the ideal gas law ($Z > 1$). A negative $B(T)$ indicates that attractive forces are dominant, meaning molecules are pulled closer together, occupying a smaller volume than predicted by the ideal gas law ($Z < 1$).\nIn this problem, we found that $\\alpha$ is negative.

We are asked to analyze the limit $V_m \\to b^+$. Let $V_m = b + \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon \\to 0^+$. Substituting this into the expression for $Z$:\n$$ Z(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{b + \\varepsilon}{(b + \\varepsilon) - b} - \\frac{a}{R T (b + \\varepsilon)} $$\n$$ Z(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{b + \\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{a}{R T (b + \\varepsilon)} $$\nWe can separate the first term:\n$$ Z(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{b}{\\varepsilon} + 1 - \\frac{a}{R T (b + \\varepsilon)} $$\nTo find the subdominant terms, we perform a Taylor expansion of the last term for small $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{b + \\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{b(1 + \\varepsilon/b)} = \\frac{1}{b} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b} + O(\\varepsilon^2)\\right) = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b^2} + O(\\varepsilon^2) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Z(\\varepsilon)$:\n$$ Z(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{b}{\\varepsilon} + 1 - \\frac{a}{R T} \\left( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b^2} + \\dots \\right) $$\n$$ Z(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{b}{\\varepsilon} + 1 - \\frac{a}{R T b} + \\frac{a \\varepsilon}{R T b^2} + O(\\varepsilon^2) $$\nThe term $\\frac{a \\varepsilon}{R T b^2} + O(\\varepsilon^2)$ goes to $0$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.

As $V_m \\to b^+$ with $V_m = b + \\varepsilon$, one has $$Z \\sim \\frac{b}{\\varepsilon} + 1 - \\frac{a}{R T b} + o(1),$$ so the divergence is dominated by excluded-volume repulsion, while attractions contribute only a finite correction.**\nThe derived asymptotic expansion matches the formula given in this option precisely.\nThe dominant term is $\\dfrac{b}{\\varepsilon} = \\dfrac{b}{V_m - b}$, which diverges as $V_m \\to b^+$. This term arises from the repulsive part of the vdW model, represented by the finite molecular volume $b$. The pressure must diverge to infinity to squeeze the substance into a volume approaching the excluded volume.\nThe attractive interactions, represented by the parameter $a$, contribute the term $-\\dfrac{a}{R T b}$, which is a finite, constant correction to $Z$ in this limit.\nThe statement and its physical interpretation are both correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.

As shown in the derivation, the term $\\dfrac{b}{V_m - b}$ diverges to $+\\infty$ as $V_m \\to b^+$. Therefore, $Z$ diverges to $+\\infty$. The attractive term provides only a finite correction and does not offset the divergence caused by the repulsive excluded-volume term.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.

As $V_m \\to b^+$, the first term diverges to $+\\infty$ while the second term approaches the finite value $\\dfrac{a}{b^2}$. Thus, $p \\to +\\infty$.\nFor the compressibility factor: $Z = \\dfrac{V_m}{V_m - b} - \\dfrac{a}{R T V_m}$. As $V_m \\to b^+$, the first term $\\dfrac{V_m}{V_m-b} \\sim \\dfrac{b}{V_m-b}$, which diverges to $+\\infty$. The second term approaches the finite value $-\\dfrac{a}{RTb}$. Thus, $Z \\to +\\infty$. The first part of the statement is correct.\nFor the second part, we must identify the coefficient of the leading-order divergence. In our asymptotic expansion, $Z = \\dfrac{b}{V_m - b} + (\\text{less singular terms})$. The coefficient of the $\\dfrac{1}{V_m-b}$ divergence is $b$. The parameter $b$ is a substance-specific constant and is independent of temperature $T$. Thus, the second part of the statement is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The divergence of $Z$ as $V_m \\to b^+$ indicates that the model predicts a negative isothermal compressibility (i.e., mechanical instability) at sufficiently high pressures, so the divergence is unphysical.**\nMechanical stability requires the isothermal compressibility, $\\kappa_T = -\\dfrac{1}{V_m}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial p}\\right)_T$, to be positive. This is equivalent to requiring $\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial V_m}\\right)_T < 0$.\nLet's compute this derivative from the vdW expression for $p$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial V_m}\\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_m} \\left( \\frac{R T}{V_m - b} - \\frac{a}{V_m^2} \\right)_T = -\\frac{R T}{(V_m - b)^2} + \\frac{2a}{V_m^3} $$\nIn the limit $V_m \\to b^+$, let $V_m = b + \\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial V_m}\\right)_T = -\\frac{R T}{\\varepsilon^2} + \\frac{2a}{(b+\\varepsilon)^3} $$\nAs $\\varepsilon \\to 0^+$, the first term $-\\dfrac{R T}{\\varepsilon^2}$ dominates and approaches $-\\infty$. Thus, $\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial V_m}\\right)_T$ is strongly negative in this limit. Since $\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial V_m}\\right)_T < 0$, the isothermal compressibility $\\kappa_T$ is positive, and the system is mechanically stable. The premise of the statement is false. The divergence is a feature of the model's hard-core repulsion, not a sign of instability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A virial expansion truncated at second order in $1/V_m$ reproduces the $1/(V_m - b)$ divergence of $Z$ in the limit $V_m \\to b^+$.**\nThe virial expansion of $Z$ is a power series in $1/V_m$: $Z = 1 + \\dfrac{B(T)}{V_m} + \\dfrac{C(T)}{V_m^2} + \\dots$. This expansion is derived under the condition of large molar volume, $V_m \\to \\infty$. A truncated virial series, for instance, at second order in $1/V_m$, is $Z \\approx 1 + \\dfrac{B(T)}{V_m}$. This is a polynomial in $1/V_m$. As $V_m \\to b^+$, this expression approaches the finite value $1 + \\dfrac{B(T)}{b}$. It has no pole at $V_m=b$ and cannot reproduce the $1/(V_m-b)$ divergence. Any finite truncation of the virial series in $1/V_m$ is analytic for $V_m > 0$ and cannot have the singularity that the full vdW equation exhibits at $V_m=b$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2638821"}]}
