This first exercise provides a foundational starting point by examining one of the most classic and spontaneous processes: the mixing of two ideal gases.

A thin, impermeable partition divides the vessel into two compartments of volumes $V_{A}^{0}$ and $V_{B}^{0}$. Each compartment contains only one species, with amounts $n_{A} = 1.20$ and $n_{B} = 2.80$ (in moles), respectively.

Express the final entropy change in joules per kelvin.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the entropy of mixing for two ideal gases, a subsequent numerical calculation, and a conceptual analysis of the case where the gases are identical. The derivation must originate from fundamental principles.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation for a closed system undergoing a reversible process is given by the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics:\n$$dU = \\delta q_{\\mathrm{rev}} - \\delta w_{\\mathrm{rev}} = TdS - PdV$$\nFrom this, the change in entropy $dS$ for a change in state can be expressed as:\n$$dS = \\frac{dU}{T} + \\frac{PdV}{T}$$\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy $U$ is a function of temperature only, so $dU = C_V dT$, where $C_V$ is the heat capacity at constant volume. The ideal gas equation of state is $PV = nRT$.\n\nThe process described is the removal of a partition between two ideal gases, $A$ and $B$, within a rigid, thermally insulated vessel. This is an irreversible process.\n1. The vessel is rigid, so no work is done on the surroundings: $w = 0$.\n2. The walls are thermally insulating, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings: $q = 0$.\nAccording to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in the internal energy of the total system is $\\Delta U = q + w = 0$.\nThe total internal energy is the sum of the internal energies of the two gases, $U = U_A + U_B$. Since the gases are ideal, $U_A$ and $U_B$ depend only on their respective temperatures. The total internal energy before mixing is $U_{\\mathrm{initial}} = U_A(T) + U_B(T)$. After mixing, the total internal energy is $U_{\\mathrm{final}}$. Since $\\Delta U = 0$, we have $U_{\\mathrm{final}} = U_{\\mathrm{initial}}$. For ideal gases, this implies that the final equilibrium temperature must be the same as the initial temperature, $T$. Therefore, the mixing process is isothermal.\n\nTo calculate the entropy change for this irreversible process, we must devise a reversible path between the same initial and final states. The initial state consists of gas $A$ in volume $V_{A}^{0}$ and gas $B$ in volume $V_{B}^{0}$, both at temperature $T$. The final state consists of a mixture of gases $A$ and $B$, with each gas occupying the total volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_{A}^{0} + V_{B}^{0}$ at temperature $T$.\n\nA suitable reversible path treats the expansion of each gas independently. We can imagine gas $A$ isothermally and reversibly expanding from its initial volume $V_{A}^{0}$ to the final volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$. Simultaneously, gas $B$ isothermally and reversibly expands from its initial volume $V_{B}^{0}$ to the final volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The total entropy change, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is the sum of the entropy changes for each gas, $\\Delta S_A$ and $\\Delta S_B$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta S_A + \\Delta S_B$$\nFor an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, $dT=0$, thus $dU = C_V dT = 0$. The expression for $dS$ simplifies to:\n$$dS = \\frac{P}{T}dV$$\nUsing the ideal gas law, $P/T = nR/V$, we have:\n$$dS = nR \\frac{dV}{V}$$\nIntegrating from an initial volume $V_i$ to a final volume $V_f$ at constant temperature gives the entropy change for the isothermal expansion:\n$$\\Delta S = \\int_{V_i}^{V_f} nR \\frac{dV}{V} = nR \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)$$\nWe apply this result to both gases $A$ and $B$.\nFor gas $A$: $\\Delta S_A = n_A R \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_A^0}\\right)$.\nFor gas $B$: $\\Delta S_B = n_B R \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_B^0}\\right)$.\n\nThe problem states that initially, both compartments are at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Using the ideal gas law:\n$V_{A}^{0} = \\frac{n_A R T}{P}$ and $V_{B}^{0} = \\frac{n_B R T}{P}$.\nThe total volume is $V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_{A}^{0} + V_{B}^{0} = \\frac{(n_A + n_B)RT}{P}$.\n\nThe volume ratios can be expressed in terms of mole fractions. Let $n_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_A+n_B$. The mole fractions are $x_A = n_A/n_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and $x_B = n_B/n_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n$$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_A^0} = \\frac{(n_A + n_B)RT/P}{n_A RT/P} = \\frac{n_A + n_B}{n_A} = \\frac{1}{x_A}$$\n$$\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_B^0} = \\frac{(n_A + n_B)RT/P}{n_B RT/P} = \\frac{n_A + n_B}{n_B} = \\frac{1}{x_B}$$\nSubstituting these ratios into the expressions for $\\Delta S_A$ and $\\Delta S_B$:\n$\\Delta S_A = n_A R \\ln(1/x_A) = -n_A R \\ln(x_A)$.\n$\\Delta S_B = n_B R \\ln(1/x_B) = -n_B R \\ln(x_B)$.\n\nThe total entropy of mixing is the sum:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta S_A + \\Delta S_B = -n_A R \\ln(x_A) - n_B R \\ln(x_B)$$\nThis expression can be written in terms of the total number of moles, $n_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -(n_{\\mathrm{total}} x_A) R \\ln(x_A) - (n_{\\mathrm{total}} x_B) R \\ln(x_B) = -n_{\\mathrm{total}} R (x_A \\ln(x_A) + x_B \\ln(x_B))$$\nSince mole fractions $x_i$ are always less than $1$, their logarithms are negative, which ensures that $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is positive, consistent with the second law for a spontaneous process.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given amounts.\nGiven: $n_A = 1.20$ mol and $n_B = 2.80$ mol.\nThe total number of moles is $n_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_A + n_B = 1.20 + 2.80 = 4.00$ mol.\nThe mole fractions are:\n$x_A = \\frac{n_A}{n_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{1.20}{4.00} = 0.300$.\n$x_B = \\frac{n_B}{n_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{2.80}{4.00} = 0.700$.\nThe universal gas constant is $R \\approx 8.3145 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -(4.00 \\text{ mol}) \\times (8.3145 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}) \\times [0.300 \\ln(0.300) + 0.700 \\ln(0.700)]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -33.258 \\text{ J K}^{-1} \\times [0.300 \\times (-1.20397) + 0.700 \\times (-0.35667)]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -33.258 \\text{ J K}^{-1} \\times [-0.36119 - 0.24967]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -33.258 \\text{ J K}^{-1} \\times [-0.61086]$$\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 20.3163 \\text{ J K}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 20.32 \\text{ J K}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we consider the case where the two gases are microscopically identical.\nIn this scenario, we are mixing two samples of the same gas, which are initially at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.\nThe initial state consists of $n_A$ moles of a gas in volume $V_A^0$ and $n_B$ moles of the same gas in volume $V_B^0$. Since $T$ and $P$ are the same, the molar volume $V_m = V/n = RT/P$ is the same in both compartments.\nThe final state, after removing the partition, is $n_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_A+n_B$ moles of the gas in a volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_A^0+V_B^0$. The final molar volume is $V_{\\mathrm{total}}/n_{\\mathrm{total}} = (V_A^0+V_B^0)/(n_A+n_B)$. Since $V_A^0 = n_A V_m$ and $V_B^0 = n_B V_m$, the final molar volume is $(n_A V_m + n_B V_m)/(n_A+n_B) = V_m$.\nThe final temperature is $T$, and the final pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{final}} = n_{\\mathrm{total}}RT/V_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_{\\mathrm{total}}R T / (n_{\\mathrm{total}}V_m) = RT/V_m = P$.\nThus, the final macroscopic state (defined by $T$, $P$, and molar volume $V_m$) is identical to the initial macroscopic state. Removing the partition between two identical gases at the same $T$ and $P$ causes no change in the thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nThe derivation for distinguishable gases is invalid here because it presumes that the particles are identifiable based on their origin (compartment $A$ or $B$). For identical, indistinguishable particles, this distinction is meaningless. We cannot say that the gas from compartment $A$ has \"expanded\" to fill the whole volume, as it is indistinguishable from the gas already present in compartment $B$. The concept of \"mixing\" does not apply.\nSince entropy is a state function, and the initial and final macroscopic states of the system are identical, the change in entropy must be zero.\nThe implication for $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is therefore:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0$$\nThis result is known as the Gibbs paradox. The seeming discontinuity (the entropy of mixing does not gradually go to zero as two gases become more and more similar) is resolved by quantum mechanics, which posits that particles of the same species are fundamentally indistinguishable. Within classical thermodynamics, it is taken as a postulate that $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0$ for identical gases under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20.32}$$", "id": "2680115"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the fundamentals, we now tackle a more general and practical challenge: calculating entropy changes when both temperature and pressure vary.

It then requires a numerical calculation of this entropy change. Entropy is a state function, so the change $\\Delta S$ depends only on the initial and final states, not on the path taken between them. The two derivations must, therefore, yield equivalent expressions.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental differential expressions for entropy change, starting from the laws of thermodynamics as stipulated. The first law of thermodynamics is $dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$. For a reversible process involving only pressure-volume work, $\\delta w_{\\text{rev}} = -P dV$, thus $dU = \\delta q_{\\text{rev}} - P dV$. The second law provides the definition of entropy change for a reversible process, $dS = \\frac{\\delta q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}$.\n\nCombining these, we get $\\delta q_{\\text{rev}} = dU + P dV$, which leads to\n$$\ndS = \\frac{dU + P dV}{T}\n$$\nFor a single-phase system of a pure substance, the internal energy $U$ can be considered a function of temperature $T$ and volume $V$. For an ideal gas, a special case, the internal energy depends only on temperature. The change in internal energy is given by $dU = n c_{v,m}(T) dT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $c_{v,m}(T)$ is the molar heat capacity at constant volume. Substituting this into the expression for $dS$ gives:\n$$\ndS = \\frac{n c_{v,m}(T) dT + P dV}{T} = n \\frac{c_{v,m}(T)}{T} dT + \\frac{P}{T} dV\n$$\nUsing the ideal gas equation of state, $PV = nRT$, we have $\\frac{P}{T} = \\frac{nR}{V}$.
