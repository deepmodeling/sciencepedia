It is a standard exercise in chemical thermodynamics that requires the application of fundamental mathematical and physical principles. We shall proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Cyclic Relation\n\nWe are given three interdependent state variables, $x$, $y$, and $z$. The interdependence implies the existence of an equation of state of the form $f(x, y, z) = 0$. By the implicit function theorem, if the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to any one variable is non-zero, we can express that variable as a function of the other two. Let us consider $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$, i.e., $z = z(x,y)$.\n\nThe primary assumption we must make is that $z(x,y)$ is a continuously differentiable function (of class $C^1$). This ensures that its first partial derivatives, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_y$ and $\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_x$, exist and are themselves continuous. Under this assumption, the total differential of $z$ is exact and can be written as:\n$$\ndz = \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y} dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_{x} dy\n$$\nNow, consider a process where the variable $y$ is held constant, so $dy=0$. Dividing by $dx$ under this condition gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_y = \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_y\n$$\nThis is trivial. A more rigorous path is to consider the relationships between the partial derivatives when we change which variable is dependent. From the equation of state, we can also write $x=x(y,z)$. Its total differential is:\n$$\ndx = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} dz\n$$\nWe can substitute the expression for $dz$ from the differential of $z(x,y)$ into this equation for $dx$:\n$$\ndx = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} dy + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y} dx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_{x} dy \\right]\n$$\nCollecting the terms with $dx$ and $dy$:\n$$\ndx \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y} \\right] = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_{x} \\right] dy\n$$\nSince $x$ and $y$ are independent variables, this equation must hold for any values of $dx$ and $dy$. This is only possible if the coefficients of both $dx$ and $dy$ are zero.\n\nFrom the coefficient of $dx$:\n$$\n1 - \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y} = 0 \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y}}\n$$\nThis is the reciprocity (or inverse) rule.\n\nFrom the coefficient of $dy$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_{x} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} = - \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_{x}\n$$\nUsing the reciprocity rule, we can write $\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)_{y} = 1 / \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y}$. Substituting this yields:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} = - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\right)_{x}}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $(\\partial y/\\partial z)_{x}$ and $(\\partial z/\\partial x)_{y}$ and recognizing that $(\\partial z/\\partial y)_x = 1/(\\partial y/\\partial z)_x$ is not the direct path. Instead, we rearrange the equation to the desired cyclic form:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}\\right)_{z} \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)_{x} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)_{y} = -1\n$$\nThis relation is also known as the triple product rule or Euler's chain rule. It holds for any three variables with a functional relationship between them, provided the functions are continuously differentiable and the partial derivatives in the denominators are non-zero.\n\nPart 2: Thermodynamic Derivation for $(\\partial T/\\partial P)_{S}$\n\nFirst, we must derive the appropriate Maxwell relation. The variables involved are $P$, $T$, $V$, and $S$. A Maxwell relation connecting derivatives with respect to $T$ and $P$ is obtained from the thermodynamic potential whose natural variables are $T$ and $P$, which is the Gibbs free energy, $G$.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy is defined as $G = U + PV - TS$. Its total differential is $dG = dU + P\\,dV + V\\,dP - T\\,dS - S\\,dT$. Using the fundamental thermodynamic relation $dU = T\\,dS - P\\,dV$ for a simple compressible system, we substitute for $dU$:\n$$\ndG = (T\\,dS - P\\,dV) + P\\,dV + V\\,dP - T\\,dS - S\\,dT\n$$\nSimplifying, we obtain the fundamental equation for $G$:\n$$\ndG = V\\,dP - S\\,dT\n$$\nSince $G$ is a state function, its differential is exact. This implies that the mixed second partial derivatives must be equal (Clairaut's Theorem). From the expression for $dG$, we identify:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = V \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = -S\n$$\nEquating the mixed second derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P}\\right)_T \\right]_P = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_P \\right]_T\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the first derivatives gives the Maxwell relation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial P}\\right)_T\n$$\nNext, we seek an expression for the isentropic pressure-temperature slope, $(\\partial T/\\partial P)_S$. We use the cyclic relation derived in Part 1 with the variables $x \\to T$, $y \\to P$, and $z \\to S$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_S \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S}\\right)_T \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = -1\n$$\nIsolating the desired derivative:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_S = - \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S}\\right)_T \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_P}\n$$\nUsing the reciprocity rule, we have $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S}\\right)_T = 1 / \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial P}\\right)_T$. Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_S = - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial P}\\right)_T}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_P}\n$$\nNow we introduce the experimentally accessible quantities. For the numerator, we use the Maxwell relation we derived: $(\\partial S/\\partial P)_T = -(\\partial V/\\partial T)_P$. For a molar quantity, this is $(\\partial S_m/\\partial P)_T = -(\\partial V_m/\\partial T)_P$.\nFor the denominator, we use the definition of the isobaric molar heat capacity: $C_{P,m} = T(\\partial S/\\partial T)_P$. This gives $(\\partial S/\\partial T)_P = C_{P,m}/T$. Note that this derivative is extensive, but the molar property is used, so we must be consistent. $(\\partial S_m/\\partial T)_P = C_{P,m}/T$.\nSubstituting these into our expression for $(\\partial T/\\partial P)_S$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_S = - \\frac{-\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial T}\\right)_P}{C_{P,m}/T} = \\frac{T \\left(\\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial T}\\right)_P}{C_{P,m}}\n$$\nFinally, we use the definition of the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{V_m}\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial T}\\right)_P$. Rearranging this gives $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial T}\\right)_P = \\alpha V_m$.\nSubstituting this final piece yields the desired expression:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_S = \\frac{T (\\alpha V_m)}{C_{P,m}} = \\frac{\\alpha T V_m}{C_{P,m}}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $(\\partial T/\\partial P)_S$ for a liquid at $T=298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $P=1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$, given the following data:\n$V_{m}=1.805\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$\\alpha=2.60\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n$C_{P,m}=75.0\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$T=298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_S = \\frac{(2.60 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}) (298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}) (1.805 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}})}{75.0\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}\n$$\nBefore computing the numerical value, we verify the units.

We must express the right-hand side of the identity in terms of these quantities. From the definition of $\\alpha$, we have $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = V\\alpha$. Differentiating this with respect to $T$ at constant $P$ using the product rule gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_{P} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(V\\alpha\\right)_P = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}\\alpha + V\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = V\\alpha$ again, we find:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial T^2}\\right)_{P} = (V\\alpha)\\alpha + V\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = V\\left(\\alpha^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our primary identity gives the final form for numerical testing:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_P}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} = -T V(T,P)\\left[\\alpha(T,P)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}\\right]\n$$\nTo verify this numerically, we define a residual, $\\mathcal{R}(T,P)$, which must be close to zero for a consistent system:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(T,P) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_P}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} + T V(T,P)\\left[\\alpha(T,P)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}\\right]\n$$\nThe partial derivatives in this expression are approximated using a symmetric two-point central finite difference scheme with steps $\\Delta T = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\Delta P = 100\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_P}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} \\approx \\frac{C_P(T, P+\\Delta P) - C_P(T, P-\\Delta P)}{2\\Delta P}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} \\approx \\frac{\\alpha(T+\\Delta T, P) - \\alpha(T-\\Delta T, P)}{2\\Delta T}\n$$\nThe program will implement functions for each equation of state ($V_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{toy}}$) and each data set ($C_{P,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, $C_{P,\\mathrm{toy,cons}}$, $C_{P,\\mathrm{toy,incons}}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{toy}}$). A central function will compute the residual $\\mathcal{R}(T,P)$ using the numerical approximations above for a given $(T,P)$ point and a provided set of functions for $V$, $C_P$, and $\\alpha$. The absolute value of this residual is then compared against the specified tolerance, $\\tau = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.
