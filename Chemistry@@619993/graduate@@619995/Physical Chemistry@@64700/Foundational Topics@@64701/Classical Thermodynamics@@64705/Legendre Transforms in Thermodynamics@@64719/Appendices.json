The problem is self-contained, objective, and free from any scientific or logical contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the total differential of the internal energy, $U(S,V,N)$. Using the chain rule for multivariate functions, we write:\n$$ dU = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S}\\right)_{V,N} dS + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_{S,N} dV + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial N}\\right)_{S,V} dN $$\nSubstituting the given definitions for temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and chemical potential $\\mu$:\n$$ dU = T dS - P dV + \\mu dN $$\nThis equation is the fundamental equation of thermodynamics, combining the first and second laws for a reversible process.\n\nWe are instructed to perform a Legendre transform on $U$ to replace the independent variable $V$ with its conjugate variable $P$. The conjugate pair is $(V, -P)$ because $(\\partial U / \\partial V) = -P$.

The consequence that the free energy as a function of an extensive variable (or free energy density as a function of an intensive variable) must be convex is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics and chemical thermodynamics. The use of the Legendre-Fenchel transform and its biconjugate to formalize the concept of a convex envelope is mathematically rigorous and standard in this context. The problem is therefore scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. The inputs are specified precisely for three test cases.

There is a clear path to a unique, deterministic solution given the fixed random seed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. It is free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or pseudo-scientific elements. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the second law of thermodynamics, which implies that a system at fixed temperature $T$, volume $V$, and number of particles $N$ will evolve to a state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy, $A$. Let us consider a system that can be described by a composition-like intensive variable $x$. The free energy density is a function $f(x)$. If this function is non-convex for some range of $x$, the system can achieve a lower total free energy by phase separating into two (or more) phases with distinct compositions, say $x_a$ and $x_b$. The average composition of the mixture is $x = \\lambda x_a + (1-\\lambda) x_b$ for some mole fraction $\\lambda \\in (0, 1)$, and its free energy density is given by the linear combination $f_{mix} = \\lambda f(x_a) + (1-\\lambda) f(x_b)$. This means the energy of the phase-separated system lies on the straight line segment connecting the points $(x_a, f(x_a))$ and $(x_b, f(x_b))$ on the graph of the free energy.\n\nTo achieve the absolute minimum energy for any average composition $x$ in $[x_a, x_b]$, the system will choose the phases $x_a$ and $x_b$ such that the line segment connecting $(x_a, f(x_a))$ and $(x_b, f(x_b))$ lies below the graph of $f(x)$ everywhere else. This line is known as a \"common tangent.\" The collection of all such points and common tangent segments forms the convex envelope of the original function $f(x)$. This convex envelope, denoted $f^{\\star\\star}(x)$, represents the true, observable macroscopic equilibrium free energy density.\n\nThe Legendre-Fenchel transform provides the rigorous mathematical framework. The transform $f^\\star(m) = \\sup_{x} \\{mx - f(x)\\}$ can be interpreted geometrically. The quantity $mx - f(x)$ is the negative of the $y$-intercept of a line with slope $m$ passing through the point $(x, f(x))$. Maximizing this is equivalent to finding the line of slope $m$ that is \"most above\" the graph of $-f(x)$, or equivalently, the supporting line that is \"most below\" the graph of $f(x)$. The inverse transform, the biconjugate $f^{\\star\\star}(x) = \\sup_{m} \\{mx - f^\\star(m)\\}$, reconstructs the function from all its supporting lines. This geometric construction of taking the supremum of all affine minorants precisely defines the convex envelope. A non-differentiable point in $f^\\star(m)$ corresponds to a slope $m$ for which multiple values of $x$ attain the supremum in the definition of $f^\\star(m)$. This corresponds to a common tangent construction, where a single slope $m$ (the constant conjugate field, e.g., chemical potential) characterizes an entire interval of compositions $[x_i, x_j]$, signifying phase coexistence.\n\nOur task is to approximate this procedure from a discrete, noisy set of points $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}$. The most direct computational analogue of finding the convex envelope $f^{\\star\\star}$ is to compute the lower convex hull of this point set. The vertices of the lower convex hull are a subset of the original points that form a convex polygon underneath all other points.\n\nThe algorithm to find the lower convex hull for a set of points already sorted by their $x$-coordinate is the Monotone Chain algorithm, which has a linear time complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, and thus satisfies the problem's requirement. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize an empty list, `hull`, to store the vertices of the lower convex hull.\n2. Iterate through the sorted points $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i=1, \\ldots, N$.\n3. For each point $P_i$, consider the last two points added to `hull`, say $P_{k-1}$ and $P_k$. We must determine if the sequence $P_{k-1} \\rightarrow P_k \\rightarrow P_i$ constitutes a \"left turn.\" For a lower hull, we must maintain a sequence of points that always turn left.\n4. The turn direction is determined by the sign of the 2D cross-product of the vectors $\\vec{P_{k-1}P_k}$ and $\\vec{P_{k-1}P_i}$. Let $P_{k-1}=(x_{k-1}, y_{k-1})$, $P_k=(x_k, y_k)$, and $P_i=(x_i, y_i)$. The cross-product is $C = (x_k - x_{k-1})(y_i - y_{k-1}) - (y_k - y_{k-1})(x_i - x_{k-1})$.\n   - $C > 0$: Left turn. The sequence is convex.\n   - $C < 0$: Right turn. The point $P_k$ is inside the hull formed by $P_{k-1}$ and $P_i$ and must be removed.\n   - $C = 0$: Collinear. Point $P_k$ is redundant and can be removed to find the minimal set of vertices.\n5. While the `hull` contains at least two points and the new point $P_i$ does not form a left turn with the last two points in `hull`, pop the last point from `hull`.\n6. After the popping loop terminates, append the current point $P_i$ to `hull`.\n7. After iterating through all points, `hull` will contain the ordered vertices of the lower convex hull.\n\nOnce the lower hull vertices are identified, we must detect the coexistence tie-lines. According to the problem definition, a tie-line is an edge of the convex hull, connecting points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ from the original data, where the original indices satisfy $j-i > 1$. This condition means the hull \"skips\" over intermediate data points, which are now located \"above\" the hull edge. This edge represents a linear segment of the convex envelope, corresponding to a phase-coexistence region.\nTo implement this, we first need to map each point back to its original index. Then, for each adjacent pair of vertices on the computed hull, say $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$, we find their original indices $i$ and $j$. If $j - i > 1$, we have found a tie-line. We then calculate the slope $m = (y_b - y_a)/(x_b - x_a)$ and record the triple $[x_a, x_b, m]$.\nThe implementation will follow this logic for each of the three test cases specified.", "answer": "[[],[[-1.0,1.0,-0.004633]],[[-2.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,2.0,0.0]]]", "id": "2647328"}]}
