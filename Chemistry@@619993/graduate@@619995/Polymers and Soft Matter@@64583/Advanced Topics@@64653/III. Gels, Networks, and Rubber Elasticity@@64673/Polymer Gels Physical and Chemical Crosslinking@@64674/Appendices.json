Report only the numerical value of $p_{c}$, which equals the conversion at the incipient gel point, rounded to $4$ significant figures. Express your final result as a unitless number.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the critical extent of reaction, $p_c$, for gelation in a system of trifunctional monomers, based on the Flory-Stockmayer theory. The theory postulates that gelation, the formation of an effectively infinite network molecule, occurs when the weight-average molecular weight of the polymer distribution diverges. This event can be analyzed by considering the branching process within the polymerizing system.\n\nThe a priori assumptions are that all functional groups are equally reactive, and that all reactions are intermolecular, meaning intramolecular cyclization is negligible. This allows the polymer clusters to be treated as tree-like structures, a key tenet of the model.\n\nLet us consider a monomer unit within a polymer cluster. This monomer has a functionality of $f$. We want to find the condition under which a path of chemical bonds extending from this monomer has a non-zero probability of being infinite in length. Let us select a monomer that is part of a larger molecule, and trace a path away from it along one of its reacted functional groups. This bond connects to another monomer unit. The question of network formation reduces to determining the expected number of new paths that branch out from this second monomer.\n\nThe second monomer has a total of $f$ functional groups. One of these groups is part of the bond we followed to reach it. Therefore, there are $f-1$ remaining functional groups available for further branching. The extent of reaction, $p$, is defined as the fraction of all functional groups that have reacted. Therefore, $p$ is also the probability that any randomly chosen functional group has formed a bond.\n\nThe expected number of new branches emanating from this second monomer is the number of its other available groups, $f-1$, multiplied by the probability that each one has reacted, $p$. This quantity is the branching factor, which we can denote as $\\sigma$.\n$$ \\sigma = (f-1)p $$\nFor the polymer network to grow infinitely, each reacted monomer must lead, on average, to at least one other reacted path. If $\\sigma < 1$, any given branch is likely to terminate, leading only to finite-sized oligomers. If $\\sigma > 1$, the number of branches proliferates, leading to the formation of an infinite network that spans the entire system. The critical point for the onset of gelation, the gel point, occurs precisely when this branching factor is equal to $1$.\n$$ \\sigma_c = (f-1)p_c = 1 $$\nHere, $p_c$ is the critical extent of reaction at the gel point.\n\nBy rearranging this equation, we can solve for $p_c$ in terms of the monomer functionality $f$.\n$$ p_c = \\frac{1}{f-1} $$\nThis is the celebrated Flory-Stockmayer gelation condition for the polymerization of a single species of $f$-functional monomers.\n\nThe problem specifies a system of trifunctional branchers, for which the functionality $f$ is given as $3$.\n$$ f = 3 $$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $p_c$:\n$$ p_c = \\frac{1}{3-1} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe question requires a numerical value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ p_c = 0.5000 $$\nThis result is a direct and fundamental consequence of the statistical theory of gelation as formulated by Flory and Stockmayer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5000}\n$$", "id": "2924764"}, {"introduction": "Once a gel is formed, its defining characteristic is its soft elasticity, which originates from the conformational entropy of its network strands.

For a single ideal Gaussian chain, the probability distribution of its end-to-end vector $\\vec{r}$ is Gaussian. Its entropy, $S$, relative to a reference state, is given by:\n$$S(\\vec{r}) = C - \\frac{3 k_B |\\vec{r}|^2}{2 \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq}}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq}$ is the mean-square end-to-end distance of the chain in the undeformed state. The change in Helmholtz free energy, $A = U - TS$, for an isothermal process is dominated by the entropic contribution, as the internal energy $U$ of an ideal chain does not change with conformation. Thus, the elastic free energy change of a single chain is:\n$$\\Delta A_{chain} = -T \\Delta S = \\frac{3 k_B T}{2 \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq}} (|\\vec{r}|^2 - |\\vec{r}_0|^2)$$\n\nThe affine network model posits that the junction points of the network transform in the same way as the macroscopic body. If a macroscopic deformation is described by the deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$, then a chain's end-to-end vector transforms from $\\vec{r}_0$ to $\\vec{r} = \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\cdot \\vec{r}_0$. We consider principal stretches $\\lambda_x, \\lambda_y, \\lambda_z$.\n\nThe total elastic free energy density of the network, $W$, is the sum of the free energy changes of all elastically active strands per unit volume. Let $\\nu_{strands}$ be the number density of such strands.\n$$W = \\nu_{strands} \\langle \\Delta A_{chain} \\rangle = \\nu_{strands} \\left\\langle \\frac{3 k_B T}{2 \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq}} (|\\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\cdot \\vec{r}_0|^2 - |\\vec{r}_0|^2) \\right\\rangle$$\nThe average is over the isotropic distribution of initial vectors $\\vec{r}_0$. For an isotropic distribution, $\\langle x_0^2 \\rangle = \\langle y_0^2 \\rangle = \\langle z_0^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq}$. Averaging $|\\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\cdot \\vec{r}_0|^2 = \\lambda_x^2 x_0^2 + \\lambda_y^2 y_0^2 + \\lambda_z^2 z_0^2$ yields:\n$$\\langle |\\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\cdot \\vec{r}_0|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq} (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $W$:\n$$W = \\nu_{strands} \\frac{3 k_B T}{2 \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq} (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2) - \\langle r_0^2 \\rangle_{eq} \\right)$$\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} \\nu_{strands} k_B T (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2 - 3)$$\nFor an incompressible material, $\\det(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}) = \\lambda_x \\lambda_y \\lambda_z = 1$. The term $(\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2)$ is the first invariant of the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor, $I_1$. So, $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\nu_{strands} k_B T (I_1 - 3)$.\n\nThe shear modulus, $G$, is determined from the stress-strain relationship in simple shear. The Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ for an incompressible neo-Hookean material is $\\sigma = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2 \\frac{dW}{dI_1} \\mathbf{B}$, where $\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}^T$ is the left Cauchy-Green tensor and $p$ is an arbitrary pressure. From our expression for $W$, we identify $2 \\frac{dW}{dI_1} = \\nu_{strands} k_B T$.\nFor simple shear by an amount $\\gamma$, the shear stress component is $\\sigma_{xy} = G\\gamma$. Theoretically, $\\sigma_{xy} = (\\nu_{strands} k_B T) B_{xy}$. For simple shear, $B_{xy} = \\gamma$, so $\\sigma_{xy} = \\nu_{strands} k_B T \\gamma$.\nComparing the two expressions for $\\sigma_{xy}$, we find the shear modulus for the affine network:\n$$G_{affine} = \\nu_{strands} k_B T$$\nThe problem provides the molar density of strands, $\\nu$, in units of mol m$^{-3}$. We convert from molecular density $\\nu_{strands}$ using Avogadro's number $N_A$: $\\nu_{strands} = \\nu N_A$. Using the given relation $R=N_A k_B$:\n$$G_{affine} = (\\nu N_A) k_B T = \\nu (N_A k_B) T = \\nu R T$$\n\n**Part 2: Phantom Network Correction**\n\nThe affine network model is an oversimplification. It assumes that cross-link junctions are fixed at their affine positions, ignoring their thermal motion. The phantom network model allows junctions to fluctuate around their mean positions, constrained only by the $f$ chains attached to each. This additional freedom for junctions to rearrange reduces the elastic energy stored for a given macroscopic deformation, thereby lowering the shear modulus.\n\nThe central result of the phantom network theory is that the elastic free energy is proportional to the cycle rank (or number of independent circuits) of the network, $\\xi$, per unit volume. The cycle rank is the number of cuts required to reduce the network to a structure with no closed loops. It is given by $\\xi = \\nu_{strands} - \\mu_{junct}$, where $\\mu_{junct}$ is the number density of cross-link junctions.\n\nThe number of junctions $\\mu_{junct}$ is related to the number of strands $\\nu_{strands}$ and the average junction functionality $f$. Each strand connects two junctions, and each junction is the meeting point of $f$ strands. By counting chain ends, we have $2\\nu_{strands} = f\\mu_{junct}$, which gives $\\mu_{junct} = \\frac{2}{f}\\nu_{strands}$.\n\nThe shear modulus of the phantom network is thus:\n$$G_{phantom} = \\xi k_B T = (\\nu_{strands} - \\mu_{junct}) k_B T$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_{junct}$:\n$$G_{phantom} = \\left(\\nu_{strands} - \\frac{2}{f}\\nu_{strands}\\right) k_B T = \\nu_{strands} k_B T \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{f}\\right)$$\nThe multiplicative reduction factor, which is the ratio of the phantom modulus to the affine modulus, is:\n$$\\frac{G_{phantom}}{G_{affine}} = \\frac{\\nu_{strands} k_B T (1 - 2/f)}{\\nu_{strands} k_B T} = 1 - \\frac{2}{f}$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now calculate the shear modulus for the phantom network using the provided data.

Subsequently, these relations are to be used to estimate $\\nu_e$ from the provided experimental data.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying rubber elasticity is that the macroscopic elastic response of a polymer network originates from the entropic penalty associated with the deformation of its constituent polymer chains. For an ideal network of Gaussian chains at thermal equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy of elasticity, $A_{el}$, is purely entropic, given by $A_{el} = -T \\Delta S_{el}$, where $T$ is the absolute temperature and $\\Delta S_{el}$ is the change in conformational entropy upon deformation.\n\nThe statistical mechanics of a single Gaussian chain gives its entropy as a function of its end-to-end vector. Summing over all $N_e$ elastically active strands in a network of volume $V$ and assuming an affine deformation—where the microscopic deformation of chain-end vectors follows the macroscopic deformation field—leads to the following expression for the elastic free energy density, $W = A_{el}/V$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{affine}} = \\frac{1}{2} n_e k_B T (\\lambda_x^2 + \\lambda_y^2 + \\lambda_z^2 - 3)$$\n Here, $n_e = N_e/V$ is the number density of elastically active strands, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\lambda_x, \\lambda_y, \\lambda_z$ are the principal extension ratios.\n\nThe small-strain shear modulus, $G$, is related to the strain energy density function $W$. For an incompressible material under simple shear, the shear stress $\\sigma$ is related to the shear strain $\\gamma$ by $\\sigma = G \\gamma$ in the linear regime. This relation is recovered from the free energy density expression. By comparing the statistical mechanical expression for $W$ with its counterpart from continuum mechanics, we identify the shear modulus for the affine model:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{affine}} = n_e k_B T$$\nThe problem requests the molar density $\\nu_e$, which is related to the number density $n_e$ by $n_e = \\nu_e N_A$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant.

It assumes that junctions are not fixed at their affine positions but are free to fluctuate, constrained only by the $f$ chains attached to them. This additional freedom reduces the effective number of elastic constraints in the network. The number of independent elastic constraints in the network is given by the cycle rank, $\\xi = N_e - N_c$, where $N_c$ is the number of junctions. For a large network with uniform junction functionality $f$, the number of strands and junctions are related by $N_e = \\frac{f}{2} N_c$. Thus, the cycle rank is $\\xi = N_e - \\frac{2}{f}N_e = N_e(1 - \\frac{2}{f})$. The shear modulus in the phantom model is proportional to the cycle rank density, $\\xi/V$.
