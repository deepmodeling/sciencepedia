It describes a canonical system in the field of soft matter physics—the electrical double layer in the counterion-only limit—and asks for a quantitative estimate based on fundamental principles. The provided parameters are physically reasonable. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the magnitude of the electrostatic potential curvature, $|\\nabla^2 \\psi|$, at the position $x=0^+$, immediately outside a uniformly charged planar surface.\n\nFor a system that is macroscopically uniform in the $y$ and $z$ directions, the electrostatic potential $\\psi$ varies only with the distance $x$ from the surface. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ thus simplifies to the second derivative with respect to $x$, i.e., $\\nabla^2 \\psi = \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2}$.\n\nThe governing equation for the electrostatic potential in a dielectric medium is the Poisson equation, which relates the potential curvature to the local volume charge density, $\\rho(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the dielectric permittivity of the medium. The magnitude of the curvature at the surface is therefore given by:\n$$ \\left|\\nabla^2 \\psi(0^+)\\right| = \\left|\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2}\\right|_{x=0^+} = \\frac{|\\rho(0^+)|}{\\varepsilon} $$\nThe system contains only monovalent counterions, each carrying a charge of magnitude $e$. Thus, the charge density at any point is $\\rho(x) = z e c(x)$, where $c(x)$ is the number concentration of ions and $z$ is their valency. For monovalent counterions, $|z|=1$, so $|\\rho(0^+)| = e c(0^+)$. The problem reduces to determining the counterion concentration at the surface, $c(0^+)$.\n\nThis concentration can be found by considering the condition of mechanical equilibrium at the interface, which is a consequence of overall thermodynamic equilibrium. The problem states we can use the concept of ideal gas osmotic pressure. The total pressure throughout the fluid must be constant. This pressure is the sum of the osmotic pressure from the mobile ions, $\\Pi(x) = c(x)k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$, and the Maxwell stress associated with the electric field. Specifically, the normal component of the pressure tensor must be constant. This gives the relation:\n$$ P(x) = \\Pi(x) - \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon E(x)^2 = \\mathrm{constant} $$\nwhere $E(x) = -d\\psi/dx$ is the electric field. In the bulk solution, far from the surface ($x \\to \\infty$), the problem specifies no added salt. This means the counterion concentration must decay to zero, so $c(\\infty)=0$. Consequently, the osmotic pressure $\\Pi(\\infty) = 0$ and the electric field $E(\\infty)=0$. The constant pressure throughout the system must therefore be zero.\n\nApplying this condition at the surface ($x=0^+$):\n$$ P(0^+) = \\Pi(0^+) - \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon E(0^+)^2 = 0 $$\nThis yields a fundamental relationship, often known as a contact value theorem:\n$$ \\Pi(0^+) = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon E(0^+)^2 $$\nWe can now use the other fundamental relations provided. The osmotic pressure at contact is given by the ideal gas law for ions:\n$$ \\Pi(0^+) = c(0^+) k_{\\mathrm{B}} T $$\nThe electric field at the surface is related to the surface charge density $\\sigma$ by Gauss's law for a planar conductor:\n$$ |E(0^+)| = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} $$\n(Here, $\\sigma$ is specified as a magnitude, so we use its positive value).\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Pi(0^+)$ and $E(0^+)$ into the pressure balance equation gives:\n$$ c(0^+) k_{\\mathrm{B}} T = \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\varepsilon} $$\nFrom this, we solve for the contact concentration of counterions:\n$$ c(0^+) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\nNow we have all components to calculate the potential curvature. The charge density at the surface is:\n$$ |\\rho(0^+)| = e c(0^+) = \\frac{e \\sigma^2}{2 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\nFinally, substituting this into the Poisson equation for the curvature:\n$$ |\\nabla^2 \\psi(0^+)| = \\frac{|\\rho(0^+)|}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{e \\sigma^2}{2 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) = \\frac{e \\sigma^2}{2 \\varepsilon^2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\nThis expression provides the required estimate in terms of the given physical constants and parameters.\n\nWe now proceed to the numerical evaluation.

A standard technique is to multiply both sides by $2(d\\psi/dx)$, which allows us to write:\n$$ 2 \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{4 e c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh(\\beta e \\psi) \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} $$\nIntegrating from a position $x$ in the diffuse layer to infinity ($x \\to \\infty$), where $\\psi=0$ and the electric field $E = -d\\psi/dx = 0$:\n$$ \\int_x^\\infty \\frac{d}{dx'} \\left( \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx'}\\right)^2 \\right) dx' = \\int_{\\psi(x)}^0 \\frac{4 e c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh(\\beta e \\psi') d\\psi' $$\n$$ \\left[ \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx'}\\right)^2 \\right]_x^\\infty = 0 - \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left[ \\frac{4 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon \\beta} \\cosh(\\beta e \\psi') \\right]_{\\psi(x)}^0 $$\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} (1 - \\cosh(\\beta e \\psi)) $$\nUsing the identity $\\cosh(u) - 1 = 2 \\sinh^2(u/2)$, we get:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{8 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{\\beta e \\psi}{2}\\right) $$\nThe surface charge density $\\sigma$ is related to the electric field at the surface ($x=0$) by Gauss's law: $\\sigma = -\\varepsilon (d\\psi/dx)_{x=0}$. At $x=0$, the potential is $\\psi_0$. We take the negative root for $d\\psi/dx$ assuming $\\psi_0>0$ so that the potential decays towards $0$.\n$$ \\sigma = -\\varepsilon \\left( - \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\beta e \\psi_0}{2}\\right) \\right) = \\sqrt{8 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\nThis is the Grahame equation.\n\nThe differential capacitance $C_d$ is defined as $C_d = d\\sigma/d\\psi_0$ at constant $T$ and $c_{\\infty}$:\n$$ C_d = \\frac{d}{d\\psi_0} \\left[ \\sqrt{8 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ C_d = \\sqrt{8 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty}} \\cdot \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{e}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$ C_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T c_{\\infty} e^2}{4 (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)^2}} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 e^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}} \\cdot \\varepsilon \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\nRecognizing the inverse Debye length $\\kappa_D = \\sqrt{2 e^2 c_{\\infty} / (\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)}$ for a symmetric $1$:$1$ electrolyte, we obtain the final expression for the differential capacitance in the ideal PB model:\n$$ C_d = \\varepsilon \\kappa_D \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n\n**Part 2: Modified Poisson-Boltzmann (Lattice-Gas) Model**\n\nThis model accounts for the finite size of ions by introducing a maximum packing density $c_{\\max} = 1/a^3$. The entropy of mixing is no longer that of an ideal gas but of a lattice gas. The electrochemical potential for ion species $i$ being constant everywhere ($\\bar{\\mu}_i(x) = \\text{const}$) leads to modified distributions for $n_\\pm(x)$:\n$$ n_{\\pm}(x) = \\frac{c_{\\infty} c_{\\max} \\exp(\\mp \\beta e \\psi(x))}{(c_{\\max} - 2c_{\\infty}) + 2 c_{\\infty} \\cosh(\\beta e \\psi(x))} $$\nLet's analyze the behavior at large surface potential, $|\\psi_0| \\to \\infty$. Assume $\\psi_0 > 0$. The surface is positively charged, so it attracts anions (counter-ions, species \"-\") and repels cations (co-ions, species \"+\").\nThe counter-ion concentration at the surface ($x=0$) is:\n$$ n_{-}(0) = \\frac{c_{\\infty} c_{\\max} \\exp(\\beta e \\psi_0)}{(c_{\\max} - 2c_{\\infty}) + 2 c_{\\infty} \\cosh(\\beta e \\psi_0)} $$\nFor large positive $\\psi_0$, $\\exp(\\beta e \\psi_0) \\to \\infty$ and $\\cosh(\\beta e \\psi_0) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(\\beta e \\psi_0)$.\n$$ \\lim_{\\psi_0 \\to \\infty} n_{-}(0) \\approx \\frac{c_{\\infty} c_{\\max} \\exp(\\beta e \\psi_0)}{c_{\\infty} \\exp(\\beta e \\psi_0)} = c_{\\max} $$\nThis shows that the counter-ion concentration at the surface saturates at the maximum possible density $c_{\\max}$. This is the phenomenon of **counter-ion crowding**.\n\nThis saturation has a profound effect on the differential capacitance $C_d = d\\sigma/d\\psi_0$.\nAt low $|\\psi_0|$, ion concentrations are small, crowding effects are negligible, and the model behaves like the ideal PB model. Thus, $C_d$ initially increases with $|\\psi_0|$.\nAs $|\\psi_0|$ increases further, counter-ions are strongly attracted to the surface, and their density increases. This leads to a more compact double layer and a continued increase in $C_d$.\nHowever, once $|\\psi_0|$ becomes very large, the layer of counter-ions immediately adjacent to the surface becomes saturated ($n_{counter}(0) \\approx c_{\\max}$). The system can no longer pack more counter-ions into this first layer. To accommodate a further increase in surface charge $\\sigma$ (by increasing $\\psi_0$), the additional counter-ions must be located further from the surface. This makes the charge storage less efficient, as the effective thickness of the double layer starts to increase. Consequently, a larger increment in potential $\\Delta \\psi_0$ is needed for a given increment in charge $\\Delta \\sigma$. This means the ratio $C_d = d\\sigma/d\\psi_0$ decreases.\nTherefore, the finite ion size and resulting crowding cause the differential capacitance $C_d$ to exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $|\\psi_0|$: it increases from a minimum at $\\psi_0=0$, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at very large $|\\psi_0|$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. In the ideal PB model for a symmetric monovalent electrolyte, the small-$|\\psi_0|$ differential capacitance scales with the square root of the bulk salt concentration and reduces to the Debye–Hückel result.**\nIn the limit of small surface potential, $|\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}| \\ll 1$, we have $\\cosh(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}) \\approx 1$. The capacitance becomes:\n$$ C_d(\\psi_0 \\to 0) = \\varepsilon \\kappa_D $$\nSince $\\kappa_D = \\sqrt{2 e^2 c_{\\infty} / (\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)}$, $C_d$ scales with $\\sqrt{c_{\\infty}}$. The expression $C_d = \\varepsilon \\kappa_D$ is the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with a plate separation equal to the Debye length $\\kappa_D^{-1}$, which is the characteristic result of the linearized PB theory (Debye-Hückel theory). The statement is therefore correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Within the ideal PB model at fixed $c_{\\infty}$, the differential capacitance increases monotonically with $|\\psi_0|$ and does not exhibit a maximum at large $|\\psi_0|$.**\nThe derived expression is $C_d = \\varepsilon \\kappa_D \\cosh(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T})$. The hyperbolic cosine function, $\\cosh(x)$, is an even function with a minimum at $x=0$, and it increases monotonically for $x>0$. Thus, $C_d$ increases monotonically with the magnitude of the potential, $|\\psi_0|$, for $|\\psi_0|>0$. As $|\\psi_0| \\to \\infty$, $\\cosh(\\dots) \\to \\infty$, so $C_d$ grows without bound and does not have a maximum.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Incorporating finite ion size through a lattice–gas modified Poisson–Boltzmann free energy leads to counterion crowding near the surface at large $|\\psi_0|$, which causes $C_d$ to attain a maximum and then decrease as $|\\psi_0|$ is further increased.**\nAs explained in Part 2, the finite volume of ions sets a maximum local density $c_{\\max}$. At large $|\\psi_0|$, the high concentration of counter-ions near the surface leads to saturation (crowding). This saturation is the physical mechanism that limits the efficiency of charge storage upon further increases in $|\\psi_0|$, causing $C_d$ to peak and then decrease. This statement accurately describes the physics and its consequence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In the lattice–gas modified model, the potential at which the differential capacitance is maximal and the height of this maximum are insensitive to $c_{\\infty}$.**\nThe crossover from ideal PB behavior to saturation-dominated behavior depends on the ratio of the bulk concentration to the maximum concentration, $\\phi_{\\infty} = c_{\\infty}/c_{\\max}$. In the limit $c_{\\infty} \\to 0$ ($\\phi_{\\infty} \\to 0$), the model reduces to the ideal PB theory, and the maximum in capacitance disappears (it moves to $|\\psi_0|=\\infty$). For finite $c_{\\infty}$, a maximum appears at a finite $|\\psi_0|$. Both the potential at which this maximum occurs and the value of the maximum capacitance explicitly depend on the parameter $\\phi_{\\infty}$, and thus on $c_{\\infty}$. For instance, a more dilute solution (smaller $c_{\\infty}$) will require a larger potential to reach the crowding regime, shifting the peak to higher $|\\psi_0|$. The statement that these quantities are \"insensitive\" to $c_{\\infty}$ is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Even in the ideal PB model with point ions and no compact layer, the differential capacitance at fixed $\\psi_0$ is nonmonotonic in $c_{\\infty}$.**\nFrom Part 1, the capacitance is $C_d = \\varepsilon \\kappa_D \\cosh(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T})$. At fixed $\\psi_0$ and $T$, the term $\\cosh(\\frac{e \\psi_0}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T})$ is a constant. The dependence on $c_{\\infty}$ is entirely through the Debye parameter, $\\kappa_D \\propto \\sqrt{c_{\\infty}}$. Therefore, $C_d$ is a monotonically increasing function of $c_{\\infty}$ ($C_d \\propto \\sqrt{c_{\\infty}}$). It is not nonmonotonic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2933323"}]}
