We must therefore examine the sign of the derivative on this interval. For any $x \\in [0.75, 1]$, we have $x > 0.5 = 1/\\gamma$. Thus, $(1 - \\gamma x)$ is negative.\nThis implies that $\\frac{dJ_1}{dx} < 0$ for all $x \\in [0.75, 1]$. Consequently, $J_1(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function in Region 1. The maximum value of $J_1(x)$ in this region occurs at the left boundary, i.e., at $x = x_c = 0.75$.\n\nRegion 2: $x \\in (0, x_c) = (0, 0.75)$.\nIn this region, the objective function is $J_2(x) = k_f(x) - \\lambda (T_g^{\\min} - T_g(x))$. Substituting the expressions for $k_f(x)$ and $T_g(x)$:\n$$\nJ_2(x) = k_0 x \\exp(\\gamma(1-x)) - \\lambda (T_g^{\\min} - (T_g^0 + ax)) = k_0 x \\exp(\\gamma(1-x)) + \\lambda a x - \\lambda(T_g^{\\min} - T_g^0)\n$$\nWe examine its derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_2}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k_0 x \\exp(\\gamma(1-x)) \\right) + \\frac{d}{dx}(\\lambda a x) = k_0 \\exp(\\gamma(1-x)) (1 - \\gamma x) + \\lambda a\n$$\nLet us evaluate the sign of this derivative for $x \\in (0, 0.75)$ using the provided parameters:\n$k_0=1.0\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\gamma=2.0$, $\\lambda=5.0\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, $a=60\\,\\text{K}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_2}{dx} = (1.0) \\exp(2.0(1-x)) (1 - 2.0x) + (5.0)(60) = \\exp(2(1-x)) (1 - 2x) + 300\n$$\nThe term $g(x) = \\exp(2(1-x)) (1 - 2x)$ is the derivative of $k_f(x)$ (up to the constant $k_0$). As established before, this term is positive for $x < 0.5$ and negative for $x > 0.5$. We need to find the minimum value of $g(x)$ on the interval $(0, 0.75)$. The derivative of $g(x)$ is $g'(x) = -4(1-x)\\exp(2(1-x))$, which is always negative for $x<1$. Thus, $g(x)$ is a decreasing function. Its minimum on $(0, 0.75)$ is approached at the right boundary $x=0.75$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 0.75^-} g(x) = \\exp(2(1-0.75)) (1 - 2(0.75)) = \\exp(0.5) (1 - 1.5) = -0.5 \\sqrt{e} \\approx -0.824\n$$\nThe minimum value of the derivative $\\frac{dJ_2}{dx}$ on $(0, 0.75)$ is therefore approximately $-0.824 + 300 = 299.176$. Since this value is significantly greater than zero, $\\frac{dJ_2}{dx} > 0$ for all $x \\in (0, 0.75)$.\nThis means $J_2(x)$ is a strictly increasing function in Region 2. The maximum value of $J_2(x)$ in this region is approached as $x$ approaches the right boundary, $x=x_c$.\n\nConclusion of Optimization:\nThe objective function $J(x)$ is continuous at $x=x_c$ because $\\lim_{x \\to x_c^-} J_2(x) = k_f(x_c) - \\lambda(T_g^{\\min} - T_g(x_c)) = k_f(x_c)$, and $J_1(x_c) = k_f(x_c)$.\nWe have shown that:\n- $J(x)$ is strictly increasing for $x \\in (0, x_c)$.\n- $J(x)$ is strictly decreasing for $x \\in [x_c, 1]$.\nTherefore, the global maximum of the objective function $J(x)$ over the domain $(0, 1]$ occurs precisely at the point $x^\\star = x_c$.\nThe optimal value is $x^\\star = 0.75$.\nThe problem asks for the optimal stoichiometric ratio $\\chi^\\star$. We convert back from $x$ to $\\chi$:\n$$\n\\chi^\\star = \\frac{1}{x^\\star} = \\frac{1}{0.75} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nThe numerical value, rounded to four significant figures, is $1.333$.\nThe optimal strategy is to operate exactly at the boundary of the minimum temperature constraint. Increasing $\\chi$ further (decreasing $x$) improves mobility and thus the pre-exponential factor of $k_f$, but the decrease in crosslink density (and thus the exponential term) dominates, causing an overall decrease in the healing rate $k_f$. Decreasing $\\chi$ (increasing $x$) below this point would satisfy the temperature constraint, but the penalty for violating it is so severe ($\\lambda a$ is large) that it is always detrimental to cross this boundary. The optimizer finds the balance at the constraint edge.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$$\n\\chi^\\star = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.3333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $\\chi^\\star = 1.333$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.333}\n$$", "id": "2927532"}]}
