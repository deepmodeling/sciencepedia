A perfect dendrimer is synthesized iteratively from a central core molecule. In each step, or \"generation\", a layer of branching units is added. This process is repeated until a dendrimer of the desired generation is formed, after which the outermost branches are capped with terminal units.\n\nConsider a specialized, perfect \"block-copolymer\" dendrimer of total generation $G$. It is built from a core of molecular weight $M_c$ and functionality (number of reactive sites) $N_c$. The synthesis proceeds in two stages using two different types of branch units.\n1.  For the inner generations, from generation $i=0$ to $i=G_1-1$ (where $GG_1 \\ge 1$), branching units of type 1 with molecular weight $M_{b1}$ are used.\n2.  For the outer generations, from generation $i=G_1$ to $i=G-1$, branching units of type 2 with molecular weight $M_{b2}$ are used.\n\nAll branching units, regardless of type, have the same branching multiplicity $f_b$, meaning each unit attaches to one inner-layer site and provides $f_b$ new reactive sites for the next layer. Assume $f_b  1$. After the final layer of type 2 branch units (at generation $G-1$) is attached, the structure is capped with terminal units, each having a molecular weight of $M_t$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytical expression for the total molecular weight, $M_{total}$, of this perfect G-generation block-copolymer dendrimer.", "solution": "We denote the number of new branches added at generation $i$ by \n$$n_i = N_c\\,f_b^i\\,. $$ \nThese receive weight $M_{b1}$ for $0\\le i\\le G_1-1$ and $M_{b2}$ for $G_1\\le i\\le G-1$, and after generation $G-1$ there are $n_G=N_c\\,f_b^G$ terminal sites each capped by $M_t$.

Consider the polycondensation of a single type of monomer, denoted as $AB_f$. Each monomer possesses one functional group of type 'A' and $f$ functional groups of type 'B'. Polymerization proceeds through the formation of a covalent bond between an 'A' group and a 'B' group.\n\nWe make the following simplifying assumptions based on the Flory-Stockmayer model for polycondensation:\n1.  All 'B' functional groups on any given monomer are equally reactive.\n2.  The reactivity of any functional group is independent of the size of the molecule to which it is attached.\n3.  The reactivity of a functional group is independent of whether other functional groups on the same monomer have already reacted.\n4.  Intramolecular reactions (cyclization) are negligible.\n\nLet $p$ be the extent of reaction, defined as the fraction of 'A' groups that have reacted. We are interested in characterizing the polymer structure. For this purpose, we classify the monomer units that have been incorporated into a polymer. A monomer is considered incorporated if its 'A' group has reacted. These incorporated units are categorized based on the number of their reacted 'B' groups:\n\n-   **Terminal Units:** Incorporated monomers where none of their 'B' groups have reacted.\n-   **Linear Units:** Incorporated monomers where exactly one of their 'B' groups has reacted.\n-   **Branched Units:** Incorporated monomers where two or more of their 'B' groups have reacted.\n\nThe Degree of Branching (DB) provides a quantitative measure of the polymer's topology.

However, we will model a more realistic scenario where reactions are incomplete. The process of adding monomers to create generation $g+1$ from the active sites of generation $g$ is performed as a discrete step. During each such step, any given active site has a constant probability $p$ of successfully reacting with a monomer.
