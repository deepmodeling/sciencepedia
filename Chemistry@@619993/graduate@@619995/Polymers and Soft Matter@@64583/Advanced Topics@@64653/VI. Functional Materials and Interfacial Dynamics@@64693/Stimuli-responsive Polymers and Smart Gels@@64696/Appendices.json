The problem specifies a starting theoretical premise ($G \\propto \\nu_{\\text{current}}$) from which to derive the solution, making it a direct test of applying fundamental principles.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation for the swollen-state shear modulus, $G_{\\text{swollen}}$, based on the premise that the shear modulus per current volume, $G$, is proportional to the number density of elastically active strands, $\\nu$, in that same volume. Let the constant of proportionality, which includes factors related to temperature and network-junction functionality, be denoted by $A$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$G = A \\nu$$\nThe number density of strands $\\nu$ is defined as the total number of elastically active strands, $N_{\\text{strands}}$, divided by the total volume of the network, $V$.\n$$\\nu = \\frac{N_{\\text{strands}}}{V}$$\nThe problem states that the network topology is conserved during swelling, which means $N_{\\text{strands}}$ is a constant. The proportionality factor $A$ is also constant as the temperature is fixed and the network structure does not change.\n\nIn the reference configuration (the dry state), the volume is $V_{\\text{dry}}$, and the shear modulus is $G_{\\text{dry}}$. The number density of strands is $\\nu_{\\text{dry}}$.\n$$G_{\\text{dry}} = A \\nu_{\\text{dry}} = A \\frac{N_{\\text{strands}}}{V_{\\text{dry}}}$$\nIn the swollen state, the volume is $V_{\\text{swollen}}$, and the shear modulus is $G_{\\text{swollen}}$. The number density of strands is $\\nu_{\\text{swollen}}$.\n$$G_{\\text{swollen}} = A \\nu_{\\text{swollen}} = A \\frac{N_{\\text{strands}}}{V_{\\text{swollen}}}$$\nTo find the relationship between $G_{\\text{swollen}}$ and $G_{\\text{dry}}$, we take the ratio of these two equations.\n$$\\frac{G_{\\text{swollen}}}{G_{\\text{dry}}} = \\frac{A \\frac{N_{\\text{strands}}}{V_{\\text{swollen}}}}{A \\frac{N_{\\text{strands}}}{V_{\\text{dry}}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dry}}}{V_{\\text{swollen}}}$$\nThis shows that the shear modulus scales inversely with the volume of the network.\n\nNext, we relate the volumes to the polymer volume fractions. The polymer volume fraction, $\\phi$, is defined as the ratio of the volume of the polymer, $V_{\\text{polymer}}$, to the total volume of the system, $V$.\nIn the reference state, the volume fraction is $\\phi_{0}$, and the total volume is $V_{\\text{dry}}$.\n$$\\phi_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\text{polymer}}}{V_{\\text{dry}}}$$\nIn the swollen state, the volume fraction is $\\phi$, and the total volume is $V_{\\text{swollen}}$.\n$$\\phi = \\frac{V_{\\text{polymer}}}{V_{\\text{swollen}}}$$\nSince the polymer itself is assumed to be incompressible, its volume $V_{\\text{polymer}}$ remains constant during the swelling process. We can express the total volumes in terms of the polymer volume and the volume fractions:\n$$V_{\\text{dry}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{polymer}}}{\\phi_{0}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{swollen}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{polymer}}}{\\phi}$$\nNow, we can find the ratio of the volumes:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{dry}}}{V_{\\text{swollen}}} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\text{polymer}}}{\\phi_{0}}}{\\frac{V_{\\text{polymer}}}{\\phi}} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the ratio of the moduli gives the desired relationship:\n$$\\frac{G_{\\text{swollen}}}{G_{\\text{dry}}} = \\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}}$$\nThus, the expression for the swollen-state shear modulus is:\n$$G_{\\text{swollen}} = G_{\\text{dry}} \\left( \\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}} \\right)$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the problem's premise that the modulus is proportional to the concentration of elastically active chains in the current volume.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical evaluation using the given values:\n$G_{\\text{dry}} = 3.210~\\text{MPa}$\n$\\phi_{0} = 1.000$\n$\\phi = 0.1234$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$G_{\\text{swollen}} = (3.210~\\text{MPa}) \\left( \\frac{0.1234}{1.000} \\right)$$\n$$G_{\\text{swollen}} = 0.396114~\\text{MPa}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in kilopascals ($\\text{kPa}$). We use the conversion factor $1~\\text{MPa} = 1000~\\text{kPa}$.\n$$G_{\\text{swollen}} = 0.396114 \\times 1000~\\text{kPa} = 396.114~\\text{kPa}$$\nFinally, rounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$G_{\\text{swollen}} \\approx 396.1~\\text{kPa}$$\nRe-checking the rounding for four significant figures on $396.114$, the fifth digit is $1$, so it rounds down. The result is $396.1$.\nLet me check the multiplication again: $3.210 \\times 0.1234 = 0.396114$. This is correct.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $396.1$.\nThe problem states \"small-strain shear modulus per unit dry volume is measured to be $G_{\\text{dry}}$\". This is a subtle but potentially critical point. Standard rubber elasticity theory defines shear modulus $G$ as having units of energy per volume, but the volume base (reference or current) can be a source of confusion. The problem however clarifies its premise for the derivation: \"the small-strain shear modulus **per current volume** is proportional to the number density of elastically active network strands\". My derivation strictly follows this premise. The phrase \"per unit dry volume\" in the problem set-up seems to be a slight imprecision in language for what should simply be called \"the shear modulus of the dry network\". Given the explicit instruction for the derivation, my approach is the only correct one.\nLet's check the significant figures one more time. $3.210$ has four significant figures. $0.1234$ has four significant figures. $1.000$ has four significant figures. The result of multiplication should be reported to four significant figures.\n$3.210 \\times 0.1234 = 0.396114$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $0.3961$.\nThen, $0.3961~\\text{MPa} = 396.1~\\text{kPa}$.\nThe answer is $396.1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{396.1}$$", "id": "2929710"}, {"introduction": "A key feature of many smart gels is their responsiveness to changes in the ionic environment, such as salt concentration or pH.

The elastic pressure contribution is then:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{\\text{el}}(\\phi) = -\\frac{\\Delta\\mu_{1, \\text{el}}}{v_1} = -RT \\nu_{e0} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0}\\right)^{1/3} - \\frac{\\phi}{2\\phi_0} \\right] = -\\frac{RT}{v_1} \\bar{\\nu}_e \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0}\\right)^{1/3} - \\frac{\\phi}{2\\phi_0} \\right]\n    $$\n    This pressure is negative for swelling ($\\phi < \\phi_0$), representing the elastic restoring force that opposes further expansion.\n\n3.  **Ionic Osmotic Pressure ($\\Pi_{\\text{ion}}$)**\n    The ionic contribution arises from the imbalance of mobile ion concentrations between the gel and the external reservoir, governed by Donnan equilibrium. The gel contains fixed charges of concentration $c_f$ per unit volume of pure polymer, which corresponds to a concentration of $c_f \\phi$ per unit volume of the swollen gel. Let us assume the fixed charges are negative.\n    The external monovalent salt reservoir has cation and anion concentrations $c_+^{\\text{out}} = c_-^{\\text{out}} = c_s$. Inside the gel, the concentrations $c_+^{\\text{in}}$ and $c_-^{\\text{in}}$ must satisfy two conditions:\n    -   Electroneutrality: $c_+^{\\text{in}} - c_-^{\\text{in}} - c_f \\phi = 0$\n    -   Donnan equilibrium for ideal ions: $c_+^{\\text{in}} c_-^{\\text{in}} = c_+^{\\text{out}} c_-^{\\text{out}} = c_s^2$\n    Solving this system of equations for the interior concentrations yields:\n    $$\n    c_+^{\\text{in}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\sqrt{(c_f \\phi)^2 + 4c_s^2} + c_f \\phi \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    c_-^{\\text{in}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\sqrt{(c_f \\phi)^2 + 4c_s^2} - c_f \\phi \\right]\n    $$\n    The total concentration of mobile ions inside the gel is $c_{\\text{ion}}^{\\text{in}} = c_+^{\\text{in}} + c_-^{\\text{in}} = \\sqrt{(c_f \\phi)^2 + 4c_s^2}$. The concentration outside is $c_{\\text{ion}}^{\\text{out}} = 2c_s$. The ionic osmotic pressure, according to the van 't Hoff equation for ideal solutions, is the difference in molar concentrations multiplied by $RT$:\n    $$\n    \\Pi_{\\text{ion}}(\\phi) = RT \\left( c_{\\text{ion}}^{\\text{in}} - c_{\\text{ion}}^{\\text{out}} \\right) = RT \\left( \\sqrt{(c_f \\phi)^2 + 4c_s^2} - 2c_s \\right)\n    $$\n    This pressure is always non-negative and drives swelling.\n\n**Final Governing Equation**\nCombining the three contributions, the total osmotic pressure balance $\\Pi_{\\text{tot}}(\\phi)=0$ becomes:\n$$\n-\\frac{RT}{v_1} \\left[ \\ln(1-\\phi) + \\phi + \\chi\\phi^2 \\right] - \\frac{RT}{v_1} \\bar{\\nu}_e \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0}\\right)^{1/3} - \\frac{\\phi}{2\\phi_0} \\right] + RT \\left( \\sqrt{(c_f \\phi)^2 + 4c_s^2} - 2c_s \\right) = 0\n$$\nFor computational convenience, we divide by $RT$ to obtain a non-dimensionalized equation, $f(\\phi) = \\Pi_{\\text{tot}}(\\phi)/RT = 0$, which we must solve for $\\phi$:\n$$\nf(\\phi) = -\\frac{1}{v_1} \\left( \\ln(1-\\phi) + \\phi + \\chi\\phi^2 \\right) - \\frac{\\bar{\\nu}_e}{v_1} \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0}\\right)^{1/3} - \\frac{\\phi}{2\\phi_0} \\right) + \\sqrt{(c_f \\phi)^2 + 4c_s^2} - 2c_s = 0\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear scalar equation for the equilibrium polymer volume fraction $\\phi$. A physically admissible solution must exist in the open interval $\\phi \\in (0,1)$. An analysis of the function $f(\\phi)$ shows that as $\\phi \\to 0^+$, the dominant term is the elastic pressure, making $f(\\phi)$ negative. As $\\phi \\to 1^-$, the mixing term $\\ln(1-\\phi)$ dominates, making $f(\\phi)$ approach $+\\infty$. This guarantees the existence of at least one root within the interval $(0, 1)$. We will employ a robust numerical root-finding algorithm, specifically the Brent method, to locate this root for each provided set of parameters.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import optimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the equilibrium polymer volume fraction for a polyelectrolyte gel\n    by solving the osmotic pressure balance equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define constants based on the problem statement ---\n    # Universal gas constant in J mol^-1 K^-1\n    R = 8.31446261815324\n    # Absolute temperature in K\n    T = 298.15\n    # Molar volume of solvent (water) in m^3 mol^-1\n    V1 = 18.0e-6\n\n    # --- Test Suite ---\n    # Each tuple contains parameters: (chi, nu_e_bar, phi_0, c_f, c_s)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: General polyelectrolyte, moderate solvent quality\n        (0.45, 0.050, 0.10, 1000.0, 100.0),\n        # Case B: Zero added salt limit\n        (0.45, 0.050, 0.10, 1000.0, 0.0),\n        # Case C: High-salt screening\n        (0.45, 0.050, 0.10, 1000.0, 1000.0),\n        # Case D: Neutral gel, no ion effect\n        (0.45, 0.050, 0.10, 0.0, 100.0),\n        # Case E: Good solvent, stronger swelling\n        (0.30, 0.050, 0.10, 1000.0, 100.0),\n        # Case F: Poorer solvent, closer to collapse\n        (0.52, 0.050, 0.10, 1000.0, 100.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        chi, nu_e_bar, phi_0, c_f, c_s = case\n\n        def total_osmotic_pressure_normalized(phi):\n            \"\"\"\n            Calculates the total osmotic pressure normalized by RT.\n            This is the function whose root we need to find.\n            phi: polymer volume fraction (dimensionless scalar)\n            \"\"\"\n            # Ensure phi is within the valid domain (0, 1) for calculations.\n            if phi = 0 or phi >= 1:\n                return np.inf\n\n            # 1.
