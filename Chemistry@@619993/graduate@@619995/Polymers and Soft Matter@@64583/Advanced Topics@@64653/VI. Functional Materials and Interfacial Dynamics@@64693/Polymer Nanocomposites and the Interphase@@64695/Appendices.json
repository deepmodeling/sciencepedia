This is the fundamental criterion for our analysis. In a system with a number density of rods $n$, the mean number of neighbors, $N$, within the connectedness range of a single test rod is given by the product of the number density and the average 'connectedness volume' around the test rod. This 'connectedness volume' is precisely the orientationally-averaged excluded volume, $\\langle V_{\\text{ex}} \\rangle$.

The excluded volume is defined for the objects whose overlap constitutes a connection. The problem states that a connection is formed when the interphase shells of thickness $h$ overlap. Therefore, the relevant object for the excluded volume calculation is not the core rod, but a larger effective cylinder of the same length $L$ and an effective connectivity diameter $D_c = D + 2h$.\n\nFor two slender rods (cylinders) of length $L$ and diameter $D_c$, with their axes oriented at a relative angle $\\gamma$, the excluded volume $V_{\\text{ex}}(\\gamma)$ is dominated by the side-to-side interactions.
