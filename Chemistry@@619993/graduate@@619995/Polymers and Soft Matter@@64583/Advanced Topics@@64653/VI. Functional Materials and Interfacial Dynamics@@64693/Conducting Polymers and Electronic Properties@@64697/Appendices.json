Each repeat unit contributes one $\\pi$-electron orbital, and the electronic structure is described by a nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian with on-site energy set to $0$ and a real, positive nearest-neighbor hopping integral $t$. The lattice spacing is $a$. Assume spin degeneracy and a half-filled chain with $N$ even, so that the total number of electrons is $N$ and each single-particle eigenstate can hold $2$ electrons.

It represents a standard, solvable problem in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, specifically the application of the Hückel or tight-binding model to a finite system. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe system is a $1$-dimensional chain of $N$ sites. The electronic wavefunction $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be expressed in the basis of localized orbitals $|j\\rangle$ centered at each site $j=1, 2, \\dots, N$:\n$$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_j |j\\rangle $$\nwhere $c_j$ is the complex amplitude of the wavefunction at site $j$. The stationary Schrödinger equation is $H|\\psi\\rangle = E|\\psi\\rangle$. In the tight-binding approximation with nearest-neighbor interactions, this becomes a set of difference equations for the amplitudes $c_j$. The on-site energy is given as $0$, and the nearest-neighbor hopping integral is $t$. For a generic site $j$ (where $2 \\le j \\le N-1$), the equation is:\n$$ t c_{j-1} + t c_{j+1} = E c_j $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous difference equation. For a finite chain with open boundaries, the wavefunction amplitude must be zero at fictitious sites $j=0$ and $j=N+1$. This means $c_0 = 0$ and $c_{N+1} = 0$.\n\nWe seek solutions in the form of standing waves, which can be constructed from a superposition of left- and right-propagating plane waves. A suitable ansatz that satisfies the boundary condition at $j=0$ is:\n$$ c_j = \\mathcal{A} \\sin(k j a) $$\nwhere $k$ is the wavevector, $a$ is the lattice spacing, and $\\mathcal{A}$ is a normalization constant. The condition $c_0 = \\mathcal{A} \\sin(0) = 0$ is automatically satisfied.\nThe second boundary condition, $c_{N+1}=0$, imposes a quantization condition on the wavevector $k$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A} \\sin(k (N+1) a) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($\\mathcal{A} \\neq 0$), this requires $k(N+1)a = n\\pi$ for an integer $n$. The allowed wavevectors are therefore:\n$$ k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{(N+1)a} $$\nThe distinct, physically meaningful eigenstates correspond to $n = 1, 2, \\dots, N$. The value $n=0$ gives a trivial null state ($c_j=0$ for all $j$), and values of $n$ beyond $N$ do not produce new independent states. The normalized eigenstates are:\n$$ c_j^{(n)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N+1}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi j}{N+1}\\right) $$\nTo find the energy eigenvalues, we substitute the ansatz back into the bulk difference equation:\n$$ t \\left[ \\sin(k(j-1)a) + \\sin(k(j+1)a) \\right] = E \\sin(kja) $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(X-Y) + \\sin(X+Y) = 2\\sin(X)\\cos(Y)$, we get:\n$$ t \\left[ 2\\sin(kja)\\cos(ka) \\right] = E \\sin(kja) $$\nThis yields the dispersion relation $E(k) = 2t \\cos(ka)$. Substituting the quantized wavevectors $k_n$, we obtain the discrete energy spectrum:\n$$ E_n = 2t \\cos(k_n a) = 2t \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{N+1}\\right), \\quad n=1, 2, \\dots, N $$\nThe problem states that $t$ is positive. Since the function $\\cos(x)$ is monotonically decreasing for $x \\in [0, \\pi]$, and the argument $\\frac{n\\pi}{N+1}$ ranges from near $0$ to near $\\pi$ as $n$ goes from $1$ to $N$, the energy levels $E_n$ decrease as the quantum number $n$ increases. The lowest energy state is $E_N$ and the highest is $E_1$.\n\nThe system has $N$ electrons, and each energy level can accommodate $2$ electrons due to spin degeneracy. To achieve the ground state, we must fill the $N/2$ lowest available energy levels. Since the energies are ordered as $E_N < E_{N-1} < \\dots < E_1$, the occupied states will be those with the largest quantum numbers.\nThe set of quantum numbers for the occupied states is $\\{N, N-1, \\dots, N - (N/2) + 1\\}$, which simplifies to $\\{N/2 + 1, N/2 + 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nThe Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is the occupied state with the highest energy. Within the set of occupied levels, the highest energy corresponds to the one with the smallest quantum number $n$, since $E_n$ decreases with $n$.\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = \\frac{N}{2} + 1 $$\nThe energy of the HOMO level is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = E_{N/2+1} = 2t \\cos\\left(\\frac{(\\frac{N}{2}+1)\\pi}{N+1}\\right) = 2t \\cos\\left(\\frac{(N+2)\\pi}{2(N+1)}\\right) $$\nThe Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is the unoccupied state with the lowest energy.
