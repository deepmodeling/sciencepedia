The Helfrich model is the canonical framework for describing the curvature elasticity of lipid bilayers. The use of a Monge gauge, small-slope approximation, and Fourier-like modes for the height function are standard methods in this field. All terms are well-defined and the problem is objective.\nThe problem is self-contained and consistent. The given parameters are physically realistic for a lipid bilayer. Let us check the small-slope condition $aq \\ll 1$:\n$a = 8\\,\\text{nm} = 8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n$L = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$\n$q = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} = \\frac{2\\pi}{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}} = 2\\pi \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n$aq = (8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})(2\\pi \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) = 16\\pi \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.05026$.\nThis value is indeed much less than $1$, so the small-slope assumption is valid. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is well-posed.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe Helfrich free-energy functional for a membrane surface $S$ is given by:\n$$ F_H = \\int_S \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (2H - C_0)^2 + \\bar{\\kappa} K \\right] dA $$\nwhere $H$ is the mean curvature, $K$ is the Gaussian curvature, $C_0$ is the spontaneous curvature, $\\kappa$ is the bending rigidity, $\\bar{\\kappa}$ is the Gaussian bending modulus, and $dA$ is the surface area element.\nThe problem specifies zero spontaneous curvature, $C_0=0$. The functional simplifies to:\n$$ F_H = \\int_S \\left( 2\\kappa H^2 + \\bar{\\kappa} K \\right) dA $$\nThe problem describes a doubly periodic system, which has the topology of a torus. For a closed surface without boundary, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature is a topological invariant:\n$$ \\int_S K \\, dA = 2\\pi \\chi $$\nwhere $\\chi$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a torus, the genus is $g=1$, so the Euler characteristic is $\\chi = 2 - 2g = 2 - 2(1) = 0$. Consequently, the contribution from the Gaussian curvature term to the total energy is zero:\n$$ \\int_S \\bar{\\kappa} K \\, dA = \\bar{\\kappa} (0) = 0 $$\nThe total bending energy is therefore given solely by the mean curvature term:\n$$ F = \\int_S 2\\kappa H^2 \\, dA $$\nFor a surface described in the Monge gauge $z=h(x,y)$ under the small-slope approximation ($|\\nabla h| \\ll 1$), the mean curvature $H$ and the area element $dA$ can be expanded in terms of the derivatives of $h$. The general expressions are:\n$$ 2H = \\frac{(1+h_y^2)h_{xx} - 2h_x h_y h_{xy} + (1+h_x^2)h_{yy}}{(1+h_x^2+h_y^2)^{3/2}} \\quad , \\quad dA = \\sqrt{1+h_x^2+h_y^2} \\,dx\\,dy $$\nwhere subscripts denote partial derivatives (e.g., $h_x = \\partial h / \\partial x$).\nThe problem asks for an expression for the energy to quadratic order in slopes. This corresponds to the lowest non-trivial order in an expansion in powers of $h$ and its derivatives.\nTo this order, we approximate $2H \\approx \\nabla^2 h = h_{xx} + h_{yy}$ and $dA \\approx dx\\,dy$. This is justified because $h_x, h_y$ are first order small quantities, and $h_{xx}, h_{yy}, h_{xy}$ are also first order small (assuming $h$ is a smooth function like the given cosine).\nThen $H^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}(\\nabla^2 h)^2$, which is a second-order term. The area element is $dA \\approx (1 + \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla h|^2)dx\\,dy$.\nThe energy integral becomes:\n$$ F = \\int_0^L \\int_0^L 2\\kappa \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2 h \\right)^2 (1 + \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla h|^2) \\,dx\\,dy + \\dots $$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla h|^2 (\\nabla^2 h)^2$ is of fourth order and is neglected. Thus, to quadratic order, the energy is given by the well-known expression:\n$$ F \\approx \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^L \\int_0^L (\\nabla^2 h)^2 \\,dx\\,dy $$\nNow, we evaluate this integral for the given height function $h(x,y) = a \\cos(qx)\\cos(qy)$.\nFirst, we compute the Laplacian $\\nabla^2 h$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = -aq \\sin(qx) \\cos(qy) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} = -aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = -aq \\cos(qx) \\sin(qy) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} = -aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) $$\n$$ \\nabla^2 h = \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} = -2aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) $$\nNext, we square the Laplacian:\n$$ (\\nabla^2 h)^2 = \\left( -2aq^2 \\cos(qx) \\cos(qy) \\right)^2 = 4a^2q^4 \\cos^2(qx) \\cos^2(qy) $$\nNow, we substitute this into the energy expression and integrate over the domain $[0,L] \\times [0,L]$:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^L \\int_0^L 4a^2q^4 \\cos^2(qx) \\cos^2(qy) \\,dx\\,dy $$\n$$ F = 2\\kappa a^2q^4 \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qy) \\,dy \\right) $$\nWe evaluate the integral $\\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$ and the given relation $q=2\\pi/L$:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx = \\int_0^L \\frac{1 + \\cos(2qx)}{2} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x + \\frac{\\sin(2qx)}{2q} \\right]_0^L $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( L + \\frac{\\sin(2qL)}{2q} \\right) - \\left( 0 + \\frac{\\sin(0)}{2q} \\right) \\right] $$\nSince $qL = 2\\pi$, we have $\\sin(2qL) = \\sin(4\\pi) = 0$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx = \\frac{L}{2} $$\nThe integral with respect to $y$ is identical. Therefore:\n$$ \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qx) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_0^L \\cos^2(qy) \\,dy \\right) = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{L^2}{4} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the energy $F$:\n$$ F = 2\\kappa a^2q^4 \\left( \\frac{L^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2 q^4 L^2 $$\nFinally, we substitute $q = 2\\pi/L$ to obtain the final analytical expression for the energy:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^4 L^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa a^2 \\frac{16\\pi^4}{L^4} L^2 = \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\kappa a^2}{L^2} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$L = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$\n$a = 8\\,\\text{nm} = 8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\kappa = 20\\,k_{B}T$\n$$ F = \\frac{8\\pi^4 (20\\,k_{B}T) (8 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})^2}{(10^{-6}\\,\\text{m})^2} $$\nWe want the result in units of $k_B T$, so we compute the numerical factor:\n$$ \\frac{F}{k_B T} = \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\times 20 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-9})^2}{(10^{-6})^2} = \\frac{8\\pi^4 \\times 20 \\times 64 \\times 10^{-18}}{10^{-12}} $$\n$$ \\frac{F}{k_B T} = 8 \\times 20 \\times 64 \\times \\pi^4 \\times 10^{-6} = 10240 \\times \\pi^4 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.01024 \\pi^4 $$\nUsing the value $\\pi^4 \\approx 97.40909$:\n$$ \\frac{F}{k_B T} = 0.01024 \\times 97.40909 \\approx 0.9974609664 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9975$.\nThe final result is $F = 0.9975\\,k_B T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9975}$$", "id": "2917342"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to compute bending energy, we now explore its implications for shape preference.
