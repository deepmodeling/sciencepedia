Consider stress-free packing of $N$ identical lipids into aggregates of three idealized geometries: a spherical micelle of radius $R$, a cylindrical micelle of radius $R$ and length $L$, and a planar bilayer with hydrophobic half-thickness approximately set by the chain length. The interfacial area per molecule at the aggregate surface is taken to be $a_0$, and the hydrophobic material is assumed to fill the interior core volume without voids. Start from these geometric and physical assumptions and, by imposing conservation of interfacial area and hydrophobic volume together with the non-stretched chain constraint (the relevant core radius not exceeding $l_c$), do the following:\n\n1) Derive a single dimensionless parameter built from $v$, $a_0$, and $l_c$ that controls the preferred interfacial curvature under these constraints, and obtain the stress-free bounds this parameter must satisfy for spherical, cylindrical, and planar geometries.\n\n2) Evaluate this dimensionless parameter for a lipid with $v = 1.2\\,\\text{nm}^3$, $l_c = 1.6\\,\\text{nm}$, and $a_0 = 0.6\\,\\text{nm}^2$.\n\n3) Using the bounds from part (1), use your computed value to decide, in excess water, whether bilayers or (normal) micelles are thermodynamically favored under the stress-free packing criterion.

The decision in part (3) should appear in your derivation, not in the final boxed answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless parameter that governs the preferred curvature of lipid aggregates based on molecular geometry. This parameter, often called the packing parameter or critical packing parameter, denoted here as $p$, relates the molecular volume to the headgroup area and the chain length. The derivation proceeds by analyzing the geometric constraints for three idealized aggregate structures: a sphere, an infinite cylinder, and a planar bilayer.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of identical lipid molecules forming an aggregate. Let $v$ be the volume of the hydrophobic core of a single molecule, and let $a_0$ be its preferred interfacial headgroup area. The total volume of the hydrophobic core of the aggregate is $V = Nv$, and the total interfacial area is $A = Na_0$. The ratio of the total volume to the total area is therefore a property of the molecule itself:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{A} = \\frac{Nv}{Na_0} = \\frac{v}{a_0}\n$$\nThis relationship is independent of the aggregate shape. We now apply this to the specific geometries, subject to the constraint that the hydrophobic core's characteristic dimension, $R$, which corresponds to the radius or half-thickness, cannot exceed the maximum effective chain length, $l_c$. That is, $R \\le l_c$.\n\n1) For a spherical micelle of radius $R$:\nThe volume of the spherical core is $V_{sph} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}$.\nThe surface area of the core is $A_{sph} = 4\\pi R^{2}$.\nEquating the ratio of these geometric quantities to the molecular ratio $\\frac{v}{a_0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{sph}}{A_{sph}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}{4\\pi R^{2}} = \\frac{R}{3}\n$$\nTherefore, we must have $\\frac{v}{a_0} = \\frac{R}{3}$, which determines the radius of the spherical micelle as $R = \\frac{3v}{a_0}$.\nApplying the non-stretching chain constraint, $R \\le l_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{3v}{a_0} \\le l_c\n$$\nRearranging this inequality defines the condition for the formation of spherical micelles in terms of a single dimensionless parameter $p = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c}$:\n$$\np = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} \\le \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n2) For a long cylindrical micelle of radius $R$ and length $L$:\nWe neglect the end caps, assuming $L \\gg R$.\nThe volume of the cylindrical core is $V_{cyl} = \\pi R^{2} L$.\nThe surface area of the core is $A_{cyl} = 2\\pi R L$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{cyl}}{A_{cyl}} = \\frac{\\pi R^{2} L}{2\\pi R L} = \\frac{R}{2}\n$$\nEquating this to the molecular ratio gives $\\frac{v}{a_0} = \\frac{R}{2}$, which determines the cylinder radius as $R = \\frac{2v}{a_0}$.\nApplying the constraint $R \\le l_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{2v}{a_0} \\le l_c\n$$\nIn terms of the packing parameter $p$, the condition for forming cylindrical micelles is:\n$$\np = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nCylindrical micelles are generally formed when spherical packing is no longer favorable but before bilayers become dominant, so the range is $\\frac{1}{3} < p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n3) For a planar bilayer:\nConsider a single leaflet of the bilayer. The hydrophobic core has a half-thickness $R$ and an interfacial area $A_{interface}$.\nThe volume of this core is $V_{leaf} = A_{interface} \\times R$.\nThe number of molecules in this leaflet is $N_{leaf} = \\frac{A_{interface}}{a_0}$.\nThe total volume of these molecules is also given by $V_{leaf} = N_{leaf} \\times v = \\frac{A_{interface}}{a_0} v$.\nEquating the two expressions for the volume:\n$$\nA_{interface} \\times R = \\frac{A_{interface}}{a_0} v\n$$\nThis gives $R = \\frac{v}{a_0}$.\nFor a stress-free planar bilayer, the chains must be fully extended to fill the space, so the half-thickness $R$ must be equal to the maximum chain length $l_c$. Thus, the ideal condition is $R = l_c$.\n$$\nl_c = \\frac{v}{a_0}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the condition for an ideal planar bilayer:\n$$\np = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} = 1\n$$\nBilayers are generally expected to form for packing parameters in the range $\\frac{1}{2} < p \\le 1$.\n\nIn summary, the dimensionless parameter is $p = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c}$. The stress-free bounds for the idealized geometries are:\n- Spherical micelles: $0 < p \\le \\frac{1}{3}$\n- Cylindrical micelles: $\\frac{1}{3} < p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Planar bilayers: $\\frac{1}{2} < p \\le 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate this parameter for the given lipid.\nThe provided values are $v = 1.2\\,\\text{nm}^3$, $l_c = 1.6\\,\\text{nm}$, and $a_0 = 0.6\\,\\text{nm}^2$.\nWe compute the value of the packing parameter $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} = \\frac{1.2\\,\\text{nm}^3}{(0.6\\,\\text{nm}^2)(1.6\\,\\text{nm})} = \\frac{1.2}{0.96} = \\frac{120}{96}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $24$:\n$$\np = \\frac{120 \\div 24}{96 \\div 24} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n$$\nThe dimensionless parameter has a value of $1.25$.\n\nFinally, we decide whether bilayers or normal micelles are thermodynamically favored. The calculated value is $p = 1.25$. We compare this to the established ranges.\n- Normal micelles (spherical or cylindrical) form for $p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Bilayers form for $\\frac{1}{2} < p \\le 1$.\n- Values of $p > 1$ indicate a preference for inverted (or reverse) structures, where the interface curves around the aqueous phase, such as inverted micelles. These structures relieve the packing stress of lipids whose hydrophobic tails are bulkier than their headgroups (a \"cone\" shape).\n\nThe calculated value $p = 1.25$ falls squarely in the regime of inverted structures. The question, however, forces a choice between normal micelles and bilayers. Neither of these structures is ideal for a lipid with $p = 1.25$; both would exhibit significant packing stress. To determine which is more 'favored', or less unstable, we consider which ideal geometry is 'closer' to the calculated parameter. The deviation from the ideal value is related to the free energy of packing stress. The ideal value for bilayers is $p=1$. The ideal values for micelles are $p \\le 1/2$. The calculated value $p=1.25$ is substantially greater than the entire range for normal micelles but is relatively close to the value for a planar bilayer. The packing stress is minimized for the geometry whose ideal $p$ is closest to the lipid's actual $p$. Since $|1.25 - 1| = 0.25$ is much smaller than $|1.25 - 0.5| = 0.75$ or $|1.25 - 1/3| \\approx 0.92$, the bilayer geometry incurs substantially less packing frustration than a normal micellar geometry. Therefore, between the two given choices, bilayers are thermodynamically favored over normal micelles.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.25}\n$$", "id": "2919361"}, {"introduction": "Biological membranes are far from simple, uniform surfaces; they are sophisticated mosaics composed of various lipids and cholesterol that can segregate into distinct coexisting phases, such as liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) domains.

We are asked to find the change in this free energy, $\\Delta F(r)$, upon the formation of a single circular pore of radius $r$. According to the problem statement, there are two competing energetic contributions to $\\Delta F(r)$.\n\nFirst, there is an energetic penalty associated with the creation of the pore's exposed edge.
