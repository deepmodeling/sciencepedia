The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to derive a unique analytical solution. The language is objective and precise. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles. The thermal power $P$, defined as the rate of heat transfer $\\frac{dQ}{dt}$, required to change the temperature of a system at a constant rate $\\beta = \\frac{dT}{dt}$ is related to the system's heat capacity $C$ by the fundamental equation of scanning calorimetry. From the chain rule, we have:\n$$P(T) = \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{dQ}{dT} \\frac{dT}{dt}$$\nThe isobaric heat capacity $C_p$ is defined as $C_p = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial T}\\right)_p$. Since the experiment is performed at constant pressure, we can write $\\frac{dQ}{dT} = C_p$. Thus, the thermal power is directly proportional to the heat capacity and the heating rate:\n$$P(T) = C_p(T) \\beta$$\nIn a DSC experiment, the instrument measures the total thermal power required to heat the sample and its container (the pan). Therefore, the total heat capacity $C_{\\mathrm{total}}(T)$ is the sum of the sample's heat capacity, $C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T)$, and the pan's heat capacity, $C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T)$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{total}}(T) = C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T) + C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T)$$\nThe total measured power is then:\n$$P(T) = \\left( C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T) + C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T) \\right) \\beta$$\nThe DSC instrument does not measure power directly but outputs an electrical signal, $y(T)$, which is proportional to the power. The instrument constant, $\\kappa$, is the calibration factor that converts this signal into physical power units:\n$$P(T) = \\kappa y(T)$$\nThis equation establishes the role of $\\kappa$ as the essential bridge between the instrument's raw output and the physical quantity of interest. By equating the two expressions for $P(T)$, we connect the measured signal to the heat capacities:\n$$\\kappa y(T) = \\left( C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T) + C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T) \\right) \\beta$$\nThis equation shows that the total power, as read from the signal via $\\kappa$, is distributed to heat both the sample and the pan. To determine the sample's properties, the contribution from the pan must be accounted for. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the sample's total heat capacity:\n$$C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T) = \\frac{\\kappa y(T)}{\\beta} - C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T)$$\nThis result demonstrates why the pan's heat capacity, $C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T)$, must be subtracted: it represents a background signal that is not intrinsic to the sample.\nThe problem requires the mass-specific heat capacity of the sample, $c_{p,s}(T)$, which is defined as the total heat capacity of the sample divided by its mass $m_s$:\n$$c_{p,s}(T) = \\frac{C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T)}{m_s}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{p,s, \\text{total}}(T)$ gives the final general formula for $c_{p,s}(T)$:\n$$c_{p,s}(T) = \\frac{1}{m_s} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa y(T)}{\\beta} - C_{\\mathrm{pan}}(T) \\right)$$\nNow, we must use the provided numerical values.

The solution is structured into three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Temperature-Dependent Buoyant Mass Correction**\n\nIn a TGA instrument, the microbalance measures an apparent weight, $W_{app}$, which is the true weight of the sample and pan, $W_{true}$, reduced by the buoyant force, $F_b$, exerted by the surrounding purge gas.\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid (gas) displaced by the suspended body (sample and pan).\n$$F_b = m_{gas} g$$\nwhere $m_{gas}$ is the mass of the displaced gas and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the displaced gas is the product of its density, $\\rho_{gas}$, and the total volume displaced by the suspended body, $V_{disp}$.\n$$F_b = \\rho_{gas} V_{disp} g$$\nThe relationship between true mass, $m_{true}$, and apparent mass, $m_{app}$, measured by the balance is given by equating the forces:\n$$m_{app} g = m_{true} g - F_b$$\nDividing by $g$, we obtain the relationship in terms of mass:\n$$m_{app} = m_{true} - \\rho_{gas} V_{disp}$$\nThe buoyant mass correction, $\\Delta m_b$, is the quantity that must be added to the apparent mass to obtain the true mass:\n$$m_{true} = m_{app} + \\Delta m_b$$\nBy comparison, the buoyant mass correction is:\n$$\\Delta m_b = \\rho_{gas} V_{disp}$$\nThe problem states that the purge gas behaves as an ideal gas. The Ideal Gas Law is given by:\n$$pV_{gas} = nRT$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $V_{gas}$ is the volume of the gas, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The number of moles $n$ can be expressed as the ratio of the mass of the gas, $m_{gas}$, to its molar mass, $M$:\n$$n = \\frac{m_{gas}}{M}$$\nSubstituting this into the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$pV_{gas} = \\left(\\frac{m_{gas}}{M}\\right) RT$$\nThe density of the gas, $\\rho_{gas}$, is defined as $\\frac{m_{gas}}{V_{gas}}$. Rearranging the equation to solve for this ratio gives:\n$$\\rho_{gas} = \\frac{m_{gas}}{V_{gas}} = \\frac{pM}{RT}$$\nSince the pressure $p$ is held constant, and $M$ and $R$ are constants, the gas density is a function of temperature, $\\rho_{gas}(T)$. The displaced volume $V_{disp}$ is assumed to be constant. Therefore, the temperature-dependent buoyant mass correction is:\n$$\\Delta m_b(T) = \\rho_{gas}(T) V_{disp} = \\frac{pM V_{disp}}{RT}$$\nThis is the required expression for the first part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of the Displaced Volume**\n\nThe problem specifies that the total displaced volume, $V_{disp}$, is the sum of the volumes of the sample, $V_s$, and the pan, $V_p$.\n$$V_{disp} = V_s + V_p$$\nThese volumes are to be estimated from their respective initial masses and bulk densities. The volume of an object is the ratio of its mass to its density. For the sample, using its initial mass $m_{s,0}$ and bulk density $\\rho_s$:\n$$V_s = \\frac{m_{s,0}}{\\rho_s}$$\nFor the pan, with mass $m_p$ and bulk density $\\rho_p$:\n$$V_p = \\frac{m_p}{\\rho_p}$$\nCombining these, the total displaced volume is:\n$$V_{disp} = \\frac{m_{s,0}}{\\rho_s} + \\frac{m_p}{\\rho_p}$$\nThis is the expression for the estimated displaced volume, assumed to be independent of temperature.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Buoyant Mass Correction at $T = 900\\ \\text{K}$**\n\nFirst, all given data must be converted to consistent SI units (kg, m, Pa, K, mol).\n- $M = 2.80134 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}$\n- $p = 1.01325 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $R = 8.314462618\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $T = 900\\ \\text{K}$\n- $m_{s,0} = 12.50\\ \\text{mg} = 1.250 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{kg}$\n- $\\rho_{s} = 1.180\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3} = 1.180 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\text{kg}}{(10^{-2}\\ \\text{m})^3} = 1.180 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$\n- $m_{p} = 85.0\\ \\text{mg} = 8.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{kg}$\n- $\\rho_{p} = 3.95\\ \\text{g}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3} = 3.95 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\ \\text{kg}}{(10^{-2}\\ \\text{m})^3} = 3.95 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$\n\nNext, we calculate the total displaced volume $V_{disp}$ using the expression from Part 2.\n$$V_s = \\frac{m_{s,0}}{\\rho_s} = \\frac{1.250 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{kg}}{1.180 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}} \\approx 1.059322 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3$$\n$$V_p = \\frac{m_p}{\\rho_p} = \\frac{8.50 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{kg}}{3.95 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}} \\approx 2.151899 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3$$\n$$V_{disp} = V_s + V_p \\approx (1.059322 + 2.151899) \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3 \\approx 3.211221 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3$$\nNow, we combine the expressions from Part 1 and Part 2 to find the buoyant mass correction, $\\Delta m_b(T)$:\n$$\\Delta m_b(T) = \\frac{pM}{RT} \\left( \\frac{m_{s,0}}{\\rho_s} + \\frac{m_p}{\\rho_p} \\right)$$\nSubstitute the numerical values for $T = 900\\ \\text{K}$:\n$$\\Delta m_b(900\\ \\text{K}) = \\frac{(1.01325 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{Pa})(2.80134 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1})}{(8.314462618\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1})(900\\ \\text{K})} \\times (3.211221 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3)$$\nFirst, calculate the gas density term:\n$$\\rho_{gas}(900\\ \\text{K}) = \\frac{pM}{RT} \\approx \\frac{2838.45}{7483.02} \\approx 0.379318\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$$\nThen, multiply by the displaced volume to find the mass correction in kilograms:\n$$\\Delta m_b(900\\ \\text{K}) \\approx (0.379318\\ \\text{kg}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (3.211221 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3) \\approx 1.218037 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{kg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in milligrams (mg).
