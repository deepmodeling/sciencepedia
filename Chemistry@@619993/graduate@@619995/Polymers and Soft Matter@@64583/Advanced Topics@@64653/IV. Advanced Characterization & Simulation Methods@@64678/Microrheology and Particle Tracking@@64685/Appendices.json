The motion is assumed to be in a Newtonian fluid, so the particle experiences a viscous drag force proportional to its velocity, $-\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt}$, where $\\gamma$ is the drag coefficient.

The plateau value is therefore:\n$$\\text{MSD}_{2D, \\text{plateau}} = \\frac{4k_B T}{k}$$\nThis is the desired relation. We can see that the plateau value depends only on thermal energy and trap stiffness, and is independent of the fluid viscosity $\\gamma$. This is expected, as the long-time limit reflects the equilibrium statistical properties of the system.\n\nFinally, we compute the in-plane spring constant $k$ using the provided experimental data.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and internally consistent, presenting a well-posed problem in optical physics and data analysis as applied to particle tracking, a standard technique in soft matter science. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: first, a theoretical justification for the proposed calibration model; second, the determination of the model parameters from provided data; and third, the explicit statement of the final calibration function.\n\n1) Theoretical Justification\n\nThe axial position $z$ of a point source is encoded in the shape of its image, the point-spread function (PSF). In an ideal, aberration-free system, the PSF is circularly symmetric and its size is minimal at the focal plane ($z=0$). The introduction of a weak astigmatism, for instance with a cylindrical lens, breaks this symmetry. Astigmatism introduces different effective focal lengths for the two orthogonal axes, which we align with the detector's $x$ and $y$ axes. Let the foci for these axes be at positions $z_x$ and $z_y$. The size of the PSF along each axis, characterized by the standard deviations $s_x(z)$ and $s_y(z)$, will be minimal at the corresponding focal plane. Away from its focus, the beam width along an axis increases. Therefore, the shape of the PSF, specifically its ellipticity, changes as a function of the axial position $z$. The difference $D(z) \\equiv s_x(z) - s_y(z)$ serves as a quantitative measure of this ellipticity and thus encodes information about $z$.\n\nThe problem states a key physical symmetry: interchanging $x \\leftrightarrow y$ is equivalent to the transformation $z \\to -z$. This is a direct consequence of the optical setup. Moving an object from a position $z$ above the nominal focal plane to a position $-z$ below it effectively swaps which of the two astigmatic line foci (one oriented along $x$, the other along $y$) is encountered first by the converging wavefront. This swaps the roles of the $x$ and $y$ axes in determining the shape of the PSF. Mathematically, this symmetry implies:\n$$s_x(z) = s_y(-z)$$\n$$s_y(z) = s_x(-z)$$\nWe use this symmetry to analyze the function $D(z) = s_x(z) - s_y(z)$. Let us evaluate $D(-z)$:\n$$D(-z) = s_x(-z) - s_y(-z)$$\nSubstituting the symmetry relations into this expression gives:\n$$D(-z) = s_y(z) - s_x(z) = -(s_x(z) - s_y(z)) = -D(z)$$\nThis identity, $D(-z) = -D(z)$, is the definition of an odd function. At the nominal focus, $z=0$, the system has no preferred orientation if the astigmatism is balanced, so $s_x(0) = s_y(0)$, which implies $D(0)=0$.\n\nAccording to Taylor's theorem, any sufficiently smooth function can be expanded as a power series around a point. The Maclaurin series for a smooth odd function $D(z)$ around $z=0$ contains only odd powers of $z$:\n$$D(z) = c_1 z + c_3 z^3 + c_5 z^5 + \\dots$$\nwhere $c_n = \\frac{1}{n!} \\frac{d^n D}{dz^n}|_{z=0}$.\n\nThe goal of calibration is to determine the function $z=f(D)$ which maps the observable $D$ to the physical coordinate $z$. This requires finding the inverse of the series for $D(z)$. If $D(z)$ is an odd function, its inverse $z(D)$ must also be an odd function. We can write the series for $z(D)$ as:\n$$z(D) = a_1 D + a_3 D^3 + a_5 D^5 + \\dots$$\nFor many practical applications, truncating this series at the cubic term provides a sufficiently accurate model. The problem states this is the case, leading to the calibration form:\n$$z = a_1 D + a_3 D^3$$\nThis justifies the proposed model from the foundational principles of optics and mathematical series expansions.\n\n2) Determination of Coefficients from Data\n\nFirst, we compute the ellipticity parameter $D = s_x - s_y$ for each data point provided. The units of $z$ are micrometers ($\\mu$m) and the units of $s_x, s_y$, and $D$ are pixels.\n\n- For $z = -1.875$: $D = 0.9625 - 2.4625 = -1.5000$.\n- For $z = -1.000$: $D = 1.1500 - 2.1500 = -1.0000$.\n- For $z = -0.4250$: $D = 1.3625 - 1.8625 = -0.5000$.\n- For $z = 0$: $D = 1.6000 - 1.6000 = 0$.\n- For $z = +0.4250$: $D = 1.8625 - 1.3625 = +0.5000$.\n- For $z = +1.000$: $D = 2.1500 - 1.1500 = +1.0000$.\n- For $z = +1.875$: $D = 2.4625 - 0.9625 = +1.5000$.\n\nThe data confirm the odd symmetry: for every point $(z, D)$, the point $(-z, -D)$ also exists. We must determine the coefficients $a_1$ and $a_3$ in the model $z = a_1 D + a_3 D^3$. This requires two equations, which we obtain from two non-trivial data points. Let us select two planes from the dataset:\n- Point 1: $(z_1, D_1) = (1.000, 1.0000)$\n- Point 2: $(z_2, D_2) = (0.4250, 0.5000)$\n\nSubstituting these values into the model equation yields a system of two linear equations for $a_1$ and $a_3$:\n$$1.000 = a_1(1.0000) + a_3(1.0000)^3 \\implies 1.000 = a_1 + a_3$$\n$$0.4250 = a_1(0.5000) + a_3(0.5000)^3 \\implies 0.4250 = 0.5000 a_1 + 0.1250 a_3$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we express $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$: $a_3 = 1.000 - a_1$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$$0.4250 = 0.5000 a_1 + 0.1250 (1.000 - a_1)$$\n$$0.4250 = 0.5000 a_1 + 0.1250 - 0.1250 a_1$$\n$$0.4250 - 0.1250 = (0.5000 - 0.1250) a_1$$\n$$0.3000 = 0.3750 a_1$$\nSolving for $a_1$:\n$$a_1 = \\frac{0.3000}{0.3750} = \\frac{300}{375} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8000$$\nNow, we find $a_3$:\n$$a_3 = 1.000 - a_1 = 1.000 - 0.8000 = 0.2000$$\nThe coefficients are $a_1 = 0.8000$ and $a_3 = 0.2000$. The units of $a_1$ are $\\mu m / \\text{pixel}$ and the units of $a_3$ are $\\mu m / \\text{pixel}^3$.\n\nWe verify this result using a third data point, as requested, for example, $(z_3, D_3) = (1.875, 1.5000)$.\nThe predicted value for $z$ is:\n$$z_{pred} = a_1 D_3 + a_3 D_3^3 = (0.8000)(1.5000) + (0.2000)(1.5000)^3$$\n$$z_{pred} = 1.2000 + (0.2000)(3.375)$$\n$$z_{pred} = 1.2000 + 0.6750 = 1.8750$$\nThe predicted value $z_{pred} = 1.8750$ is in exact agreement with the measured value $z_3 = 1.875$, which confirms the correctness of our coefficients and the suitability of the model for this dataset.\n\n3) Final Calibration Function\n\nThe explicit calibration function $z = f(s_x - s_y)$ is obtained by substituting the determined coefficients into the model. The coefficients are to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$a_1 = 0.8000$\n$a_3 = 0.2000$\nThe function, with $z$ in micrometers and $s_x, s_y$ in pixels, is:\n$$z = 0.8000(s_x - s_y) + 0.2000(s_x - s_y)^3$$\nThis is the final expression for the calibration law.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000(s_x - s_y) + 0.2000(s_x - s_y)^3}$$", "id": "2921315"}]}
