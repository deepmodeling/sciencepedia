{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The foundation of Gel Permeation Chromatography lies in the differential partitioning of solutes between the mobile phase flowing between porous particles and the stagnant mobile phase within the pores. This exercise challenges you to derive and apply the fundamental relationship for the partition coefficient, $K_d$, which quantifies the fraction of pore volume accessible to a solute of a given size. Mastering this calculation is the first step toward interpreting any GPC experiment quantitatively [@problem_id:2916694].", "problem": "A single-column gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiment is performed at isothermal conditions in tetrahydrofuran. You are told only the following foundational facts about size-exclusion chromatography: in the ideal, purely entropic (non-adsorbing) regime, solutes are separated by their hydrodynamic size because they partition between the interstitial (void) volume outside the pores and the pore volume inside the packing. A completely excluded solute reports the interstitial (void) volume, while a completely included small solute reports the total mobile phase volume. A partially included solute spends some fraction of its migration within the pore volume, which can be characterized by a dimensionless distribution coefficient that represents the fraction of pore volume that is effectively accessible to that solute.\n\nIn a particular experiment, a very high molar mass standard (fully excluded) elutes at a measured volume $V_{0} = 18.50\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, and a small molecule standard (fully included) elutes at a measured volume $V_{t} = 42.00\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. An unknown polymer analyte elutes at $V_{e} = 36.70\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ under identical conditions.\n\nStarting from the physical picture above and the definitions of the void volume and total mobile phase volume, derive a relationship linking $V_{e}$, $V_{0}$, $V_{t}$, and the distribution coefficient $K_{d}$, then compute the value of $K_{d}$ for the analyte. Round your final numerical value to four significant figures. Express $K_{d}$ as a pure number (no units).\n\nFinally, based on the value you compute, briefly interpret the physical meaning in terms of the analyte’s access to the pore volume and its hydrodynamic size relative to the pore size distribution. Your interpretation will be assessed separately from the numerical answer; the graded numerical answer is only $K_{d}$.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, well-posed exercise in the fundamental principles of size-exclusion chromatography, a sub-discipline of chemical engineering and polymer science. It is scientifically sound, contains all necessary information, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a relationship for the distribution coefficient, $K_{d}$, based on a physical model of chromatographic separation. In ideal size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), or gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the separation is governed solely by the entropy associated with the confinement of polymer coils within a porous medium. There are no enthalpic interactions, such as adsorption, with the stationary phase.\n\nThe total volume of the chromatography column, $V_{c}$, is composed of the volume occupied by the solid packing material, $V_{s}$, and the total volume of the mobile phase. The total mobile phase volume is, in turn, composed of two parts: the interstitial volume, $V_{0}$, which is the volume of the mobile phase between the packing particles, and the internal pore volume, $V_{p}$, which is the volume of the mobile phase inside the porous particles.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a very large molecule that is completely excluded from the pores will elute at a volume corresponding to the interstitial volume. Thus, the elution volume for a fully excluded species is defined as:\n$$V_{\\text{excluded}} = V_{0}$$\nThe problem provides this value as $V_{0} = 18.50\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nConversely, a very small molecule that can explore the entire volume of the mobile phase, both interstitial and all of the pore volume, will elute at a volume corresponding to the total mobile phase volume, $V_{t}$.\n$$V_{t} = V_{0} + V_{p}$$\nThe problem provides this total volume as $V_{t} = 42.00\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. From this relationship, we can express the total pore volume, $V_{p}$, in terms of the experimentally measurable quantities $V_{t}$ and $V_{0}$:\n$$V_{p} = V_{t} - V_{0}$$\n\nNow, consider an analyte of intermediate size, such as the unknown polymer. This analyte can access the interstitial volume $V_{0}$ but can only access a fraction of the pore volume $V_{p}$ due to steric hindrance. This accessible fraction is defined as the distribution coefficient, $K_{d}$. The value of $K_{d}$ ranges from $0$ for a fully excluded molecule to $1$ for a fully included molecule. The volume of the pores accessible to this intermediate analyte is thus $K_{d} V_{p}$.\n\nThe total volume that the analyte experiences during its transit through the column is its elution volume, $V_{e}$. This volume is the sum of the interstitial volume (which it must traverse) and the accessible portion of the pore volume. This gives us the fundamental equation for elution in SEC:\n$$V_{e} = V_{0} + K_{d} V_{p}$$\n\nTo derive the relationship requested by the problem, we substitute the expression for $V_{p}$ into this equation:\n$$V_{e} = V_{0} + K_{d} (V_{t} - V_{0})$$\nThis is the required relationship linking $V_{e}$, $V_{0}$, $V_{t}$, and $K_{d}$. To compute the value of $K_{d}$ for the analyte, we must rearrange this equation algebraically to solve for $K_{d}$:\n$$V_{e} - V_{0} = K_{d} (V_{t} - V_{0})$$\n$$\\implies K_{d} = \\frac{V_{e} - V_{0}}{V_{t} - V_{0}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided experimental values:\n$V_{0} = 18.50\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n$V_{t} = 42.00\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n$V_{e} = 36.70\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{36.70 - 18.50}{42.00 - 18.50}$$\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{18.20}{23.50}$$\n$$K_{d} \\approx 0.774468085...$$\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. The numerator, $18.20$, has four significant figures, and the denominator, $23.50$, also has four significant figures. Therefore, the result should be reported to four significant figures.\n$$K_{d} = 0.7745$$\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is straightforward. A distribution coefficient of $K_{d} = 0.7745$ signifies that the unknown polymer analyte is able to access, on average, $77.45\\%$ of the total pore volume of the stationary phase. This value is closer to $1$ than to $0$, indicating that the hydrodynamic size of the analyte molecules is relatively small compared to the pore size distribution of the packing material. The molecules are significantly smaller than the largest pores, allowing them substantial access to the interior of the packing beads, but they are still large enough to be excluded from the narrowest pores, preventing them from accessing the full pore volume (for which $K_{d}$ would be $1$). The analyte is therefore correctly classified as partially included.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7745}$$", "id": "2916694"}, {"introduction": "Building on the ideal concept of elution volumes, this practice delves into the realities of experimental measurement. A robust GPC analysis requires not just determining the void and total permeation volumes, but also quantifying the uncertainty in these measurements.

In size-exclusion mode, the elution of a completely excluded macromolecular standard operationally defines the void volume, and the elution of a fully permeating small-molecule standard operationally defines the total permeation volume. You are tasked with two goals: first, to formulate a scientifically sound protocol to measure these volumes and quantify their uncertainties; second, to propagate these uncertainties into the distribution coefficient of an unknown solute.\n\nDesign, in words, an experimental protocol to determine the void volume and total permeation volume and quantify their uncertainties using replicate injections. Your protocol must be rooted in the operational definitions of these volumes and standard practice in size-exclusion chromatography, including: choice of standards, replicate strategy, steady-state conditioning, and how to estimate the standard uncertainty of the mean from replicate measurements.\n\nThen, starting from first principles that connect accessible mobile phase volumes in a packed porous bed to elution volumes in size-exclusion chromatography, derive an expression for the distribution coefficient in terms of the elution volume of the analyte, the void volume, and the total permeation volume. Do not assume any particular functional form a priori; build the expression directly from the conceptual definitions of completely excluded and fully included tracers and accessible volumes.\n\nFinally, apply your protocol to the following dataset collected on the same day under unchanged conditions. Three replicate injections were performed for each species, and the instrument reported elution volumes for each injection:\n- Completely excluded standard (e.g., Blue Dextran) elution volumes: $5.12\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $5.09\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $5.14\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Fully included small-molecule standard (e.g., toluene) elution volumes: $12.45\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $12.50\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $12.47\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Unknown polymer solute elution volumes: $9.80\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $9.77\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $9.83\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nAssume statistical independence among all replicate sets and that environmental drift is negligible over the measurement window. Use the sample mean of each set as the best estimate of each volume and the standard uncertainty of the mean, computed from the sample standard deviation and the number of replicates, as the standard uncertainty of each mean. Using a first-order Taylor expansion for uncertainty propagation with zero covariances, compute the standard uncertainty in the distribution coefficient of the unknown solute. Round your final numerical result to three significant figures and express it as a pure number (no units).", "solution": "The problem presented is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It describes a standard procedure in polymer characterization using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), also known as Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). The concepts, data, and required calculations are consistent with established principles of analytical chemistry. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested: first, the design of an experimental protocol; second, a derivation of the distribution coefficient from first principles; and third, the application of this framework to the provided data to compute the uncertainty in the distribution coefficient of an unknown solute.\n\nAn experimental protocol to determine the void volume, $V_o$, and the total permeation volume, $V_t$, and to quantify their uncertainties is as follows:\nFirst, the GPC system, consisting of a pump, injector, column, and detector (typically a differential refractometer), must be brought to a steady state. This is achieved by flowing the mobile phase (in this case, tetrahydrofuran) at a constant flow rate and temperature through the entire system until a stable, flat baseline is observed from the detector signal. This process, known as system conditioning, is critical to ensure that subsequent measurements are not affected by thermal or chemical drifts.\n\nSecond, standards must be selected. For the void volume, $V_o$, a macromolecular standard must be chosen whose hydrodynamic radius is larger than the radius of the largest pores in the column's stationary phase. This ensures the standard is completely excluded from the pore volume and thus elutes at the interstitial volume of the column. A high molecular weight Blue Dextran is a suitable choice. For the total permeation volume, $V_t$, a small-molecule standard must be chosen that is small enough to access the entire pore volume of the stationary phase without any specific interaction (adsorption). A solvent marker like toluene is appropriate for this purpose. The unknown analyte is treated as a third species.\n\nThird, a replicate strategy must be executed. Prepare dilute solutions of the excluded standard, the included standard, and the unknown analyte in the mobile phase. A series of replicate injections, minimally three for each species, must be performed. After each injection, sufficient time must be allowed for the elution of all components and the return of the detector signal to the stable baseline before the next injection commences. For each resulting chromatogram, the elution volume, $V_e$, corresponding to the peak maximum is recorded.\n\nFourth, the data are analyzed to estimate the volumes and their standard uncertainties. For each set of $n$ replicate elution volumes ($x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$), the best estimate for the true elution volume is the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$, given by $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$. The uncertainty of this estimate is quantified by the standard uncertainty of the mean, $u(\\bar{x})$, which is derived from the sample standard deviation, $s_x$. The sample standard deviation is calculated as $s_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$. The standard uncertainty of the mean is then $u(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{s_x}{\\sqrt{n}}$. This procedure is applied independently to the replicate sets for the void volume ($V_o$), total permeation volume ($V_t$), and the analyte's elution volume ($V_e$).\n\nNext, the expression for the distribution coefficient, $K$, is derived from first principles. The total volume of a packed chromatography column consists of the volume occupied by the solid packing material and the volume occupied by the mobile phase. The mobile phase volume can be partitioned into the interstitial volume between the packing particles, which is the void volume $V_o$, and the volume contained within the pores of the particles, the pore volume $V_p$. The total permeation volume, $V_t$, is the volume accessible to a small molecule that can explore both the interstitial and all of the pore volume. Thus, by definition, $V_t = V_o + V_p$.\n\nAn analyte elutes at a volume, $V_e$, corresponding to the total volume accessible to it. This accessible volume is the sum of the interstitial volume, $V_o$, and a fraction of the pore volume, $V_p$. This fraction is defined as the size-exclusion distribution coefficient, $K$. Therefore, the elution volume for an arbitrary analyte is given by the fundamental equation of SEC:\n$$V_e = V_o + K \\cdot V_p$$\nThe value of $K$ ranges from $0$ for a completely excluded molecule (for which $V_e = V_o$) to $1$ for a fully permeating molecule (for which $V_e = V_o + V_p = V_t$). To express $K$ in terms of measurable quantities, we first express the pore volume, $V_p$, using the operational definitions of $V_o$ and $V_t$:\n$$V_p = V_t - V_o$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $V_e$:\n$$V_e = V_o + K(V_t - V_o)$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the distribution coefficient, $K$:\n$$V_e - V_o = K(V_t - V_o)$$\n$$K = \\frac{V_e - V_o}{V_t - V_o}$$\nThis is the required expression for the distribution coefficient in terms of the elution volume of the analyte ($V_e$), the void volume ($V_o$), and the total permeation volume ($V_t$).\n\nFinally, we apply this framework to the provided dataset. The number of replicates is $n=3$ for all species.\nThe given volumes are:\n- Excluded standard: $v_{o,1}=5.12\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $v_{o,2}=5.09\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $v_{o,3}=5.14\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Included standard: $v_{t,1}=12.45\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $v_{t,2}=12.50\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $v_{t,3}=12.47\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Unknown solute: $v_{e,1}=9.80\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $v_{e,2}=9.77\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $v_{e,3}=9.83\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample mean for each volume:\n$$\\bar{V}_o = \\frac{5.12 + 5.09 + 5.14}{3} = \\frac{15.35}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\approx 5.1167\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$\\bar{V}_t = \\frac{12.45 + 12.50 + 12.47}{3} = \\frac{37.42}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\approx 12.4733\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$\\bar{V}_e = \\frac{9.80 + 9.77 + 9.83}{3} = \\frac{29.40}{3} = 9.80\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the sample standard deviation for each set:\n$$s_{V_o} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(5.12-\\frac{15.35}{3})^2 + (5.09-\\frac{15.35}{3})^2 + (5.14-\\frac{15.35}{3})^2}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.00126...}{2}} \\approx 0.025166\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$s_{V_t} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(12.45-\\frac{37.42}{3})^2 + (12.50-\\frac{37.42}{3})^2 + (12.47-\\frac{37.42}{3})^2}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.00126...}{2}} \\approx 0.025166\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$s_{V_e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(9.80-9.80)^2 + (9.77-9.80)^2 + (9.83-9.80)^2}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0018}{2}} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThen, we find the standard uncertainty of each mean, $u(\\bar{V}) = s_V / \\sqrt{n}$:\n$$u(\\bar{V}_o) = \\frac{0.025166...}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.01453\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$u(\\bar{V}_t) = \\frac{0.025166...}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.01453\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$u(\\bar{V}_e) = \\frac{0.03}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.01732\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nTo find the uncertainty in $K$, we use the first-order Taylor expansion for uncertainty propagation. For $K = f(\\bar{V}_e, \\bar{V}_o, \\bar{V}_t)$, the squared uncertainty $u(K)^2$ is:\n$$u(K)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{V}_e}\\right)^2 u(\\bar{V}_e)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{V}_o}\\right)^2 u(\\bar{V}_o)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{V}_t}\\right)^2 u(\\bar{V}_t)^2$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{V}_e} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{V}_t - \\bar{V}_o}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{V}_o} = \\frac{\\bar{V}_e - \\bar{V}_t}{(\\bar{V}_t - \\bar{V}_o)^2} = \\frac{K-1}{\\bar{V}_t - \\bar{V}_o}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\bar{V}_t} = -\\frac{\\bar{V}_e - \\bar{V}_o}{(\\bar{V}_t - \\bar{V}_o)^2} = -\\frac{K}{\\bar{V}_t - \\bar{V}_o}$$\nSubstituting these into the uncertainty equation gives:\n$$u(K)^2 = \\frac{1}{(\\bar{V}_t - \\bar{V}_o)^2} \\left[ u(\\bar{V}_e)^2 + (K-1)^2 u(\\bar{V}_o)^2 + K^2 u(\\bar{V}_t)^2 \\right]$$\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values.

It can be derived from the fundamental definition:\n    $$ M_w = \\sum_i w_i M_i = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{N_i M_i}{\\sum_j N_j M_j} \\right) M_i = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i} $$\n-   **Z-average molar mass ($M_z$):** The next higher moment average.\n    $$ M_z = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i w_i M_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\left( \\frac{N_i M_i}{\\sum_j N_j M_j} \\right) M_i^2}{\\sum_i \\left( \\frac{N_i M_i}{\\sum_j N_j M_j} \\right) M_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^3 / \\sum_j N_j M_j}{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2 / \\sum_j N_j M_j} = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^3}{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2} $$\nThe Polydispersity Index ($\\mathrm{PDI}$) is defined as the ratio of the weight-average to the number-average molar mass:\n$$ \\mathrm{PDI} = \\frac{M_w}{M_n} $$\n\nNow, consider the GPC experiment. The chromatogram is a signal $S(V_e)$ as a function of elution volume $V_e$. The problem states that for a DRI detector, the signal is proportional to the mass concentration $c(V_e)$:\n$$ S(V_e) = K \\cdot c(V_e) $$\nwhere the constant $K$ is assumed to be independent of molar mass $M$.\n\nThe mass of polymer, $\\Delta m$, eluting in a small volume element $\\Delta V_e$ is $\\Delta m = c(V_e) \\Delta V_e$. From the detector response, this means:\n$$ \\Delta m \\propto S(V_e) \\Delta V_e $$\nFor a practical computation, the chromatogram is discretized into slices, indexed by $i$. For each slice, we have a signal intensity $S_i = S(V_i)$ and a volume width $\\Delta V_i$. The mass in this slice, $m_i$, is proportional to the area of the slice on the chromatogram:\n$$ m_i \\propto S_i \\Delta V_i $$\nThe total mass is proportional to the total area under the chromatogram, $\\sum_j S_j \\Delta V_j$. The weight fraction $w_i$ of the polymer in slice $i$ is therefore:\n$$ w_i = \\frac{m_i}{\\sum_j m_j} = \\frac{S_i \\Delta V_i}{\\sum_j S_j \\Delta V_j} $$\nUsing the GPC calibration $M_i = f(V_i)$, we can express the molar mass averages in terms of these computable quantities. We rewrite the definitions of $M_n$, $M_w$, and $M_z$ using weight fractions $w_i$.\n\n-   For $M_n$:\n    $$ M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i m_i}{\\sum_i (m_i/M_i)} = \\frac{m_{total} \\sum_i w_i}{m_{total} \\sum_i (w_i/M_i)} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_i (w_i/M_i)} = \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{w_i}{M_i}\\right)^{-1} $$\n-   For $M_w$:\n    $$ M_w = \\sum_i w_i M_i $$\n-   For $M_z$:\n    $$ M_z = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i w_i M_i} $$\nThis provides a complete and self-consistent procedure. We now evaluate each option against this derivation.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** This option presents the fundamental definitions for $M_n$, $M_w$, $M_z$, and $\\mathrm{PDI}$ as:\n$M_n = \\dfrac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i}$, $M_w = \\dfrac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i}$, $M_z = \\dfrac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^3}{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}$, and $\\mathrm{PDI} = M_w/M_n$. These are all **Correct**.\nThe computational procedure described is:\n1.  Discretize the chromatogram and calculate the mass contribution of each slice as being proportional to $S(V_i) \\Delta V_i$. This is **Correct**.\n2.  Use the calibration $M_i = f(V_i)$. This is **Correct**.\n3.  Calculate weight fractions as $w_i = \\dfrac{S(V_i)\\,\\Delta V_i}{\\sum_j S(V_j)\\,\\Delta V_j}$. This is **Correct**.\n4.  Compute the averages using the formulas: $M_n = \\left(\\sum_i \\dfrac{w_i}{M_i}\\right)^{-1}$, $M_w = \\sum_i w_i M_i$, and $M_z = \\dfrac{\\sum_i w_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i w_i M_i}$. These are precisely the formulas derived above and are **Correct**.\n5.  It correctly states the necessary condition that detector response per unit mass must be independent of molar mass. This is **Correct**.\nEvery part of this option is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option defines $M_n = \\sum_i w_i M_i$ and $M_w = \\left(\\sum_i \\dfrac{w_i}{M_i}\\right)^{-1}$. This is a reversal of the correct formulas for $M_n$ and $M_w$. The definition for $M_z$ is also incorrect, as is the definition of $\\mathrm{PDI} = M_z/M_n$. The computational procedure suggests using only the peak height at the apex, which is nonsensical for determining a distribution, and claims peak areas are not needed, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of chromatography.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option provides an incorrect definition for $M_n$ as $M_n = \\dfrac{\\sum_i N_i}{\\sum_i \\dfrac{N_i}{M_i}}$, which evaluates to the number-weighted harmonic mean, not the number-weighted arithmetic mean. The definition for $M_z$ is also missing a denominator. Critically, it posits that the DRI signal $S(V_e)$ is proportional to the *number concentration* of molecules ($N_i \\propto S(V_i)\\,\\Delta V_i$). This is fundamentally incorrect; a DRI detector is a mass-sensitive detector, so the signal is proportional to *mass concentration*.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option correctly references the definitions from option A, but its computational procedure is flawed. It suggests ignoring the $\\Delta V_i$ factor, stating $m_i \\propto S(V_i)$. This is incorrect; the mass in a slice is proportional to concentration multiplied by the volume of the slice, i.e., $S(V_i)\\Delta V_i$. More grievously, it proposes a confused application of the Universal Calibration principle. It suggests replacing $M_i$ with $[\\eta]_i M_i$ in the averaging sums, which is not how Universal Calibration works. Furthermore, it claims this can be done with only a single concentration detector, which is impossible as an ancillary detector (like a viscometer) is required to determine the intrinsic viscosity $[\\eta]_i$ for each slice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, only option A presents a fully correct and self-consistent set of definitions and procedures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2916703"}]}
