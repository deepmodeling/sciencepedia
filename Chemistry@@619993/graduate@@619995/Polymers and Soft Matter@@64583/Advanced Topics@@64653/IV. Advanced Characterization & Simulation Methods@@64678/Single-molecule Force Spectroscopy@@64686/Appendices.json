The parameters ($L_c$, ionic strengths, concentrations) and observed phenomena (specific vs. nonspecific adhesion, effect of salt, surfactant, competition assay, and surface passivation) are physically realistic and standard in the field of nanomechanics and biophysics. The question asks for an interpretation of these results based on established scientific principles. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided data and fundamental principles.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis of Options**\nThis problem requires distinguishing between specific ligand-receptor interactions and nonspecific adhesion based on a series of controlled experiments.\n\nFirst, we analyze the two types of observed events:\n1.  **Long-extension events**: These ruptures occur at extensions of $18$ to $22\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which is close to the PEG linker's contour length of $L_{c} \\approx 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This is a classic signature of a single polymer tether being stretched almost to its full length before the bond at its end—the specific ligand-receptor bond—ruptures. The definitive proof of specificity comes from the competition assay: the addition of free soluble ligand at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ eliminates these events. The free ligands in solution bind to the surface receptors, blocking them and thus preventing the tip-tethered ligand from binding.\n2.  **Short-rupture events**: These occur at very short tip-sample separations ($< 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), persist after the addition of free ligand, and are modulated by changes in ionic strength, addition of surfactant, and surface passivation. This collection of characteristics identifies them as nonspecific adhesion, or \"sticking,\" between the AFM tip assembly and the substrate.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In SMFS, nonspecific adhesion refers to tip–sample interactions not mediated by the intended ligand–receptor pair, arising from generic forces such as electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals dispersion, and hydrogen bonding; screening electrolytes can suppress the electrostatic component, nonionic surfactants can suppress hydrophobic adhesion, and PEG passivation reduces residual sticking by steric exclusion.**\nThis statement provides a correct and comprehensive definition of nonspecific adhesion in the context of SMFS. It correctly identifies the primary physical origins of such forces. Furthermore, it accurately describes the standard mitigation strategies and their underlying physical mechanisms. Screening electrolytes (like the phosphate buffer at higher ionic strength) reduce the range of electrostatic forces. Nonionic surfactants (like Tween-$20$) adsorb to surfaces and reduce nonspecific adhesion arising from hydrophobic effects. A polymer brush (like PEG) grafted onto the substrate creates a steric barrier that physically prevents the tip from making close contact with the surface, thereby reducing all forms of short-range adhesion. All parts of this statement are physically correct and consistent with experimental practice.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because increasing ionic strength reduces the Debye screening length and therefore attenuates long-range electrostatic interactions, the observed decrease in short-rupture adhesion when $I$ increases from $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ implicates an electrostatic attractive contribution to nonspecific adhesion.**\nThe Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$, which characterizes the decay length of the electrostatic potential in an electrolyte solution, is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength $I$: $\\kappa^{-1} \\propto I^{-1/2}$. Increasing $I$ from $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ significantly decreases $\\kappa^{-1}$, leading to more effective screening of electrostatic interactions. The experiment shows that this increase in screening causes a drop in the probability of short-rupture (nonspecific) events. If reducing an interaction leads to less adhesion, the interaction must have been attractive. Therefore, the observation correctly implicates an attractive electrostatic force as a component of the nonspecific adhesion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Hydrophobic interactions are strengthened by adding a nonionic surfactant; therefore, the observed decrease in adhesion upon adding $0.01\\,\\%$ Tween-$20$ indicates that specific ligand–receptor bonds, not nonspecific adhesion, were being removed.**\nThis statement is founded on a false premise. Nonionic surfactants such as Tween-$20$ are amphiphilic molecules used precisely because they *reduce* or *suppress* hydrophobic interactions. They adsorb at hydrophobic interfaces, presenting their hydrophilic head groups to the aqueous phase, thereby passivating the surface against hydrophobic aggregation. The observation that adhesion decreases upon adding Tween-$20$ is direct evidence that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the adhesion. Since it is the short-rupture events that are affected, this confirms a hydrophobic component to the nonspecific adhesion. The conclusion drawn in the statement is incorrect because the premise is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Rupture events that occur at extensions approaching the PEG contour length and that disappear upon addition of free ligand are diagnostic of specific binding, whereas nonspecific adhesion typically manifests as near-contact detachments at short separations with broad, context-dependent force distributions.**\nThis statement correctly summarizes the key diagnostic criteria used to distinguish specific from nonspecific events in SMFS. The rupture location (extension) is a primary indicator: extension close to the linker's contour length points to the unfolding of the tether, a hallmark of a single specific bond. The competition assay (disappearance upon adding free ligand) is the chemical \"gold standard\" for confirming specificity. Conversely, nonspecific adhesion is characterized by its short-range nature (near-contact detachment) and often a lack of a well-defined rupture force, reflecting the heterogeneous and multi-faceted nature of surface sticking. The statement accurately reflects the interpretation of the experimental data presented.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Van der Waals dispersion forces are dominant at separations $> 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; hence, the near-contact short-rupture events cannot originate from van der Waals interactions and must be specific bonds.**\nThis statement contains a fundamental error regarding the range of intermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces between macroscopic bodies are extremely short-ranged, typically decaying with distance $d$ as $d^{-n}$ where $n$ is large (e.g., $d^{-2}$ for parallel plates, $d^{-7}$ for interaction between an atom and a surface). They are significant only at separations of a few nanometers at most. At separations $> 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, they are utterly negligible compared to unscreened electrostatic forces. The premise that van der Waals forces are dominant at long range is false. Consequently, the conclusion is invalid. Van der Waals forces are, in fact, a prime candidate for contributing to *near-contact* nonspecific adhesion, contrary to the statement's claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, and D are scientifically correct and accurately interpret the provided experimental results.

The use of a Poisson distribution to model rare, independent binding events is a well-established and appropriate approximation of the underlying binomial process. The provided numerical values for $\\rho$, $A$, and $f$ are physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and all necessary information for a unique solution is provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or logical flaws.\n\n**Conclusion:** The problem is deemed valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed from first principles as required. The fundamental process involves multiple independent trials. The total number of ligands, $N$, within the contact area $A$ is given by the product of the surface density $\\rho$ and the area $A$.\n$$N = \\rho A$$\nEach of these $N$ ligands represents an independent trial, with a probability of success (forming a tether) being $f$. The number of tethers formed, $k$, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$P_{\\text{binomial}}(k; N, f) = \\binom{N}{k} f^k (1-f)^{N-k}$$\nThe problem specifies that the number of tethers is a Poisson random variable. This is the correct physical limit for the binomial distribution when the number of trials $N$ is large and the probability of success $f$ is small, such that their product, the mean $\\lambda = Nf$, is a finite constant. We verify these conditions with the given parameters:\n$$N = (1000~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) (1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}) = 1000$$\nThe number of trials $N=1000$ is large. The probability $f = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}$ is small. The conditions for the Poisson approximation are therefore well-satisfied. The Poisson distribution for the number of tethers $k$ is given by:\n$$P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ is the mean number of tethers formed per approach, calculated as:\n$$\\lambda = N f = (\\rho A) f$$\nThe event of \"double tethering\" corresponds to $k=2$. Substituting $k=2$ into the Poisson probability mass function gives the expression for the probability of this event:\n$$P(k=2; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^2 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{2!}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$ yields the final derived expression in terms of the given parameters:\n$$P(k=2) = \\frac{(\\rho A f)^2 \\exp(-\\rho A f)}{2}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values. First, we calculate the mean $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = (1000~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2})(1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1000 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.1$$\nThe mean number of tethers per approach is $0.1$. Using this value, we calculate the probability of double tethering:\n$$P(k=2) = \\frac{(0.1)^2 \\exp(-0.1)}{2} = \\frac{0.01 \\times \\exp(-0.1)}{2} = 0.005 \\times \\exp(-0.1)$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.904837418$, we find:\n$$P(k=2) \\approx 0.005 \\times 0.904837418 = 0.004524187$$\nRounding this result to $3$ significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$P(k=2) \\approx 0.00452$$\nFinally, we address the qualitative difference in the force-extension curve for a double-tether event compared to a single-tether event. Under quasi-static pulling, the two tethers in a double-tether event act as two identical springs (polymeric linkers) in parallel. The total force, $F_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the forces from each individual linker. For a given extension, $x$, the force contribution from a single linker is $F_{\\text{linker}}(x)$.\nFor a single-tether event, the measured force is:\n$$F_{\\text{single}}(x) = F_{\\text{linker}}(x)$$\nFor a double-tether event, with two identical linkers in parallel, the total force is:\n$$F_{\\text{double}}(x) = F_{\\text{linker}}(x) + F_{\\text{linker}}(x) = 2 F_{\\text{linker}}(x)$$\nTherefore, for any given extension $x$ prior to rupture, the force measured in a double-tether event is twice the force of a single-tether event. This means the force-extension curve for a double tethering will have a steeper initial slope, indicating a higher effective stiffness ($k_{\\text{eff}} = 2k_{\\text{linker}}$). Furthermore, the rupture signature will be distinct. A single-tether event shows one rupture event where the force drops to zero. A double-tether event will typically exhibit two sequential rupture events. As the force increases, one tether will break, causing the force to drop by approximately half to the force level of a single tether. The remaining tether is then stretched until it, too, ruptures, at which point the force drops to zero.

The function to be solved simplifies to $g(L_p) = A/L_p - f$.\n\nThe derivative of $g(L_p)$ with respect to $L_p$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dL_p} = -\\frac{A}{L_p^2} = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T C(z)}{L_p^2}\n$$\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{B}} > 0$, $T > 0$, $C(z) > 0$, and $L_p^2 > 0$, the derivative $dg/dL_p$ is strictly negative for all $L_p \\in (0, \\infty)$.

Based on the limit analysis, such a bracket is guaranteed to exist.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. **Bracket Finding**: We must identify an interval $[a, b]$ such that $g(a) > 0$ and $g(b)  0$. We can select a very small positive number for the lower bound, for example, $a = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, for which $g(a)$ will be large and positive. For the upper bound $b$, we can start with a candidate value, say $b_{init} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and check the sign of $g(b_{init})$. If $g(b_{init})$ is positive, we iteratively increase the upper bound, for instance by doubling it ($b_{new} = 2 \\cdot b_{old}$), until $g(b)$ becomes negative. This expansion is guaranteed to terminate as $\\lim_{L_p \\to \\infty} g(L_p) = -f  0$.\n\n$2$. **Iterative Refinement (Bisection)**: Once the bracket $[a, b]$ is established, we iteratively compute the midpoint $m = a + (b - a)/2$ and evaluate $g(m)$. Let $g_a = g(a)$. If $g_a$ and $g(m)$ have opposite signs (i.e., $g_a g(m)  0$), the root lies in $[a, m]$, so we update the bracket by setting $b = m$. Otherwise, the root must lie in $[m, b]$, so we set $a = m$ and update $g_a = g(m)$. This process halves the interval of uncertainty in each step.\n\n$3$. **Termination Criterion**: The iteration continues until the width of the bracket, $b - a$, is smaller than a specified tolerance.
