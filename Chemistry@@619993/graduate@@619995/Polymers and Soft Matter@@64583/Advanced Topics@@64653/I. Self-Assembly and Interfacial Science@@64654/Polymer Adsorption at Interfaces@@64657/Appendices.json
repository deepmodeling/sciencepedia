Therefore, a full analysis is warranted.\n\nThe first task is to derive the equilibrium condition for the contact angle of a sessile droplet on a flat, rigid solid surface. This condition, known as Young's equation, can be derived by considering the mechanical equilibrium of forces at the three-phase contact line. The contact line is the boundary where the solid ($S$), liquid ($L$), and vapor ($V$) phases meet.\n\nLet the interfacial free energies per unit area (or interfacial tensions) be denoted by $\\gamma_{SV}$, $\\gamma_{SL}$, and $\\gamma_{LV}$ for the solid-vapor, solid-liquid, and liquid-vapor interfaces, respectively. These quantities can be interpreted as forces acting per unit length along the contact line.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe transport of the adsorbing species is governed by Fick's second law in one dimension:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(z,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c(z,t)}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nThe problem is defined for the domain $z>0$ and $t>0$ with the following initial and boundary conditions:\n1.  Initial condition: $c(z,0) = c$ for $z>0$.\n2.  Absorbing boundary at the interface: $c(0,t) = 0$ for $t>0$.\n3.  Bulk concentration remains constant: $c(z \\to \\infty, t) = c$ for $t>0$.\n\nThis is a standard problem in heat and mass transfer. The solution for the concentration profile $c(z,t)$ is well-known and can be obtained using a similarity transformation or Laplace transforms. The solution is given in terms of the error function, $\\text{erf}(x)$:\n$$\nc(z,t) = c \\cdot \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere the error function is defined as $\\text{erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^x \\exp(-u^2)du$.\n\nThe diffusive flux in the $z$-direction is given by Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ_z(z,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c(z,t)}{\\partial z}\n$$\nTo find the flux onto the interface at $z=0$, we first compute the spatial derivative of the concentration profile:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c(z,t)}{\\partial z} = c \\cdot \\frac{d}{dz}\\left[\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right)\\right] = c \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{4Dt}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nEvaluating this derivative at $z=0$ gives the concentration gradient at the interface:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right|_{z=0} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\pi Dt}}\n$$\nThe flux at the interface is therefore:\n$$\nJ_z(0,t) = -D \\left(\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\pi Dt}}\\right) = -c\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the flux is in the $-z$ direction, i.e., towards the interface. The problem defines $\\Gamma(t)$ as the cumulative number of entities adsorbed per unit area. This is the time integral of the magnitude of the flux at the interface.\n$$\n\\Gamma(t) = \\int_0^t -J_z(0,t') dt' = \\int_0^t c\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t'}} dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\Gamma(t) = c\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi}} \\int_0^t (t')^{-1/2} dt' = c\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi}} \\left[2(t')^{1/2}\\right]_0^t\n$$\nThis yields the short-time asymptotic form for the surface coverage:\n$$\n\\Gamma(t) = 2c\\sqrt{\\frac{Dt}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis result is known as the Cottrell equation in electrochemistry. It is valid as long as the semi-infinite domain approximation holds and the surface does not become saturated.\n\n### Critical Discussion for Polymer Adsorption\n\nThe preceding derivation is generic for any point-like, non-interacting species. For a solution of flexible polymer chains, the interpretation of $c$ and $D$ and the validity of the result require careful consideration.\n\n1.  **Identification of Parameters**: In the context of a polymer solution, the \"adsorbing species\" is the polymer chain. Therefore, $c$ must be identified with the number concentration of chains, $c_c$. The relevant diffusion coefficient for the transport of whole chains from the bulk to the surface is the center-of-mass (COM) diffusion coefficient, $D_c$. The monomer concentration is $c_m = Nc_c$, where $N$ is the number of monomers (segments) per chain.\n\n2.  **Breakdown of the Point-Particle Approximation**: The derived result, $\\Gamma(t) \\propto \\sqrt{t}$, treats the polymer as a point particle. This approximation is only valid if the characteristic length scale of the diffusion process, the thickness of the depletion layer $\\delta(t) \\sim \\sqrt{D_c t}$, is much larger than the intrinsic size of the diffusing object. For a polymer, this size is its radius of gyration, $R_g$.\n\n3.  **The Role of Chain Connectivity and Crossover Time**: Chain connectivity is the fundamental reason for the breakdown of the simple model. It gives the polymer a finite-size, extended conformation (characterized by $R_g \\sim aN^{\\nu}$, where $a$ is segment length and $\\nu \\approx 0.588$ is the Flory exponent in a good solvent) and a spectrum of internal relaxation modes.\nThe simple diffusive model using $D_c$ fails when the length scales are comparable, i.e., when $\\delta(t) \\lesssim R_g$. This defines a critical crossover time, $t^*$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{D_c t^*} \\approx R_g \\implies t^* \\approx \\frac{R_g^2}{D_c}\n$$\nThis time scale $t^*$ corresponds to the longest internal relaxation time of the chain (the Rouse or Zimm time), which is the time required for a chain to diffuse a distance comparable to its own size.\n\n4.  **Adsorption Regimes**:\n    -   **Chain Diffusion Regime ($t > t^*$)**: For times significantly longer than the chain relaxation time, the chain's COM has diffused a distance greater than $R_g$. The polymer chain can be coarse-grained as a single diffusing particle. In this regime, the adsorption process is limited by the arrival of chains from the bulk, and the derived result $\\Gamma_c(t) = 2c_c\\sqrt{\\frac{D_c t}{\\pi}}$ is expected to be valid, provided the surface concentration is still low.\n    -   **Segmental/Internal Modes Regime ($t < t^*$)**: For times shorter than $t^*$, the chain's COM has barely moved. The chain cannot be treated as a point particle. Adsorption is governed by the dynamics of individual segments. Chains that are initially close to the surface ($z \\lesssim R_g$) can adsorb when one of their segments makes contact with the surface via conformational fluctuations. The kinetics are significantly more complex and are not described by a simple diffusion equation with coefficient $D_c$. The segmental diffusion coefficient $D_s$ plays a role, but because the segments are connected, the process is not simple diffusion of independent monomers. The $\\Gamma(t) \\propto \\sqrt{t}$ law, with the coefficients derived for COM diffusion, is invalid in this regime.\n\nIn summary, chain connectivity introduces an intrinsic length scale ($R_g$) and a corresponding time scale ($t^* = R_g^2/D_c$) which are absent for simple molecules. The short-time asymptotic result based on a single diffusion coefficient $D_c$ is only valid for times $t > t^*$, breaking down at shorter times where the internal structure and dynamics of the polymer chain dominate the adsorption process.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2c\\sqrt{\\frac{Dt}{\\pi}}}\n$$", "id": "2923556"}, {"introduction": "While thermodynamics dictates whether adsorption is favorable, the geometry and size of the polymer chains determine the ultimate surface coverage at saturation.

The problem explicitly directs us to model the lateral footprint of each chain by the area set by its coil size.\n\nThe characteristic size of an ideal polymer coil is its radius of gyration, $R_g$. The radius of gyration quantifies the average spatial extent of the polymer's segments around its center of mass.
