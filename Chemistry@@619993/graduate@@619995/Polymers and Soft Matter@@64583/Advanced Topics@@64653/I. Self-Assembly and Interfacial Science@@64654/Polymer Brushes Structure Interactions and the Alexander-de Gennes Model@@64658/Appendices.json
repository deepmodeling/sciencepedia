The premises are factually sound (e.g., the Flory exponent $\\nu=3/5$ for a self-avoiding walk in three dimensions). The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary scaling laws and numerical data to construct the required parameter and calculate its value. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity. It is a complete, consistent, and solvable problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested.\n\n**(a) Construction and Interpretation of the Overlap Parameter $\\Xi$**\n\nThe transition from the \"mushroom\" regime (isolated chains) to the \"brush\" regime (interacting chains) is governed by the degree of spatial overlap between neighboring polymer coils grafted onto the surface. We can quantify this by constructing a dimensionless parameter, $\\Xi$, that compares the characteristic lateral size of a polymer coil to the average distance between grafting points.\n\nFrom the givens, the typical size (radius) of an isolated polymer chain in a good solvent follows the Flory scaling:\n$$R \\sim a N^{\\nu}$$\nwhere $N$ is the degree of polymerization, $a$ is the monomer size, and $\\nu=3/5$ is the Flory exponent. This radius $R$ represents the size of a single \"mushroom.\"\n\nThe two-dimensional grafting density $\\sigma$ is the number of chains per unit area. Therefore, the area available to each chain on the surface is $A = \\sigma^{-1}$. The mean lateral spacing $d$ between adjacent grafting points can be estimated as the square root of this area:\n$$d \\sim A^{1/2} = \\sigma^{-1/2}$$\n\nOverlap begins when the size of the coils, $R$, becomes comparable to the spacing $d$. A dimensionless overlap parameter, $\\Xi$, can be defined as the ratio of the projected area of an unperturbed coil, which scales as $R^2$, to the area available per chain, $A = \\sigma^{-1}$. This definition directly captures the concept of lateral crowding.\n$$\\Xi \\equiv \\frac{R^2}{A} = R^2 \\sigma$$\nNote that this parameter can also be expressed as the square of the ratio of the two characteristic lengths, $\\Xi = (R/d)^2$, which is equivalent.\n\nSubstituting the scaling for $R$, we construct the overlap parameter in terms of the given variables:\n$$\\Xi \\sim (a N^{\\nu})^2 \\sigma = a^2 N^{2\\nu} \\sigma$$\nThis is the required expression for the dimensionless overlap parameter. The prefactor of order unity is omitted, as is standard in scaling theory.\n\nThe physical meaning of the regimes is as follows:\n- **Mushroom Regime ($\\Xi \\ll 1$):** If $\\Xi \\ll 1$, then $R^2 \\sigma \\ll 1$, which implies $R \\ll \\sigma^{-1/2} = d$. In this limit, the chains are grafted far apart from each other relative to their size. They do not interact with their neighbors and behave as isolated coils, adopting a flattened, three-dimensional random coil conformation, metaphorically described as a \"mushroom.\"\n- **Brush Regime ($\\Xi \\gg 1$):** If $\\Xi \\gg 1$, then $R^2 \\sigma \\gg 1$, which implies $R \\gg d$. In this limit, the chains are so densely grafted that their unperturbed coils would severely interpenetrate. To avoid the high osmotic penalty associated with this overlap in a good solvent, the polymer chains stretch away from the surface in the direction normal to it. This collective stretching minimizes unfavorable segment-segment contacts and leads to the formation of a dense layer of extended chains, known as a \"polymer brush.\" The AdG model successfully predicts the properties of this stretched state based on this fundamental idea of overlap avoidance.\n\n**(b) Numerical Evaluation of the Overlap Parameter $\\Xi$**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the numerical value of $\\Xi$ for a specific system.

Before proceeding to a solution, we must validate the premises. The problem provides five fundamental scaling relations for a polymer brush in a good solvent. We shall treat these as axioms for our derivation.\n\nThe given relations are:\n1. The correlation blob size $\\xi$ scales with the number of monomers per blob, $g$, as $\\xi \\sim a g^{\\nu}$, where $a$ is the monomer size and $\\nu$ is the Flory exponent.\n2. The total number of blobs per chain is given by the ratio $N/g$, where $N$ is the total degree of polymerization.\n3. The brush height $h$ is formed by the stacking of these blobs, leading to the scaling $h \\sim (N/g)\\xi$.\n4. The monomer concentration $c$ within the brush, assuming a uniform \"box\" profile, is the total number of monomers per unit area, $N\\sigma$, divided by the brush height $h$, giving $c \\sim N \\sigma / h$.\n5. In a semidilute solution or a brush, the concentration $c$ is equivalent to the concentration within a correlation blob, yielding $c \\sim g/\\xi^{3}$.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving expressions for $\\xi$ and $h$ and then evaluating them numerically. The set of provided scaling relations forms a closed system of equations. For the purpose of scaling analysis, we treat the proportionality '$\\sim$' as equality, understanding that this neglects dimensionless prefactors of order unity.\n\nThe system of equations is:\n$$ \\xi = a g^{\\nu} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ h = \\frac{N}{g} \\xi \\quad (2) $$\n$$ c = \\frac{N \\sigma}{h} \\quad (3) $$\n$$ c = \\frac{g}{\\xi^3} \\quad (4) $$\n\nTo derive an expression for the correlation length $\\xi$, we can eliminate the other variables $h$, $c$, and $g$. We begin by equating the two expressions for the concentration $c$ from equations $(3)$ and $(4)$:\n$$ \\frac{N \\sigma}{h} = \\frac{g}{\\xi^3} $$\nThis can be rearranged to express the product $gh$:\n$$ g h = N \\sigma \\xi^3 $$\nNow, we use equation $(2)$ which defines the height $h$.

We use equation $(2)$, $h = (N/g)\\xi$. We have an expression for $\\xi$, but we first need to express $g$ in terms of the given parameters. From equation $(1)$, we can write $g$ in terms of $\\xi$:\n$$ g = \\left( \\frac{\\xi}{a} \\right)^{1/\\nu} $$\nSubstituting our result for $\\xi = \\sigma^{-1/2}$:\n$$ g = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{-1/2}}{a} \\right)^{1/\\nu} = a^{-1/\\nu} \\sigma^{-1/(2\\nu)} $$\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $g$ and $\\xi$ into the equation for $h$:\n$$ h = \\frac{N}{g} \\xi = N \\cdot \\left( a^{-1/\\nu} \\sigma^{-1/(2\\nu)} \\right)^{-1} \\cdot \\sigma^{-1/2} $$\n$$ h = N a^{1/\\nu} \\sigma^{1/(2\\nu)} \\sigma^{-1/2} $$\n$$ h = N a^{1/\\nu} \\sigma^{\\frac{1}{2\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}} $$\n$$ h = N a^{1/\\nu} \\sigma^{\\frac{1-\\nu}{2\\nu}} $$\nThis is the closed-form scaling expression for the brush height $h$.\n\nThe set of relations provided is internally consistent and leads to the correct scaling for the Alexander-de Gennes model.

The brush height is more than an order of magnitude larger than the correlation length.
