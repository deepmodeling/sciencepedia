It is a valid problem in theoretical soft matter physics. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution will proceed by addressing the three specified tasks in order.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of $F(R)$ and Identification of Constant Terms**\n\nFor a sphere of radius $R$, the two principal curvatures are identical at every point on the surface: $k_{1} = k_{2} = \\frac{1}{R}$. The mean curvature $H$ and Gaussian curvature $K$ are therefore uniform over the surface:\n$$\nH = \\frac{k_{1} + k_{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R}}{2} = \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\n$$\nK = k_{1} k_{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right) = \\frac{1}{R^{2}}\n$$\nThe total surface area of the sphere is $A = 4\\pi R^{2}$.\n\nThe total free energy functional is $F = \\int_{A} \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( 2H - C_{0} \\right)^{2} + \\bar{\\kappa}\\, K + \\gamma_{0} \\right] \\, dA$.

Since $\\bar{\\kappa}$ is a constant, this is equal to $\\bar{\\kappa} \\int_{A} K dA$. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact, orientable 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary (such as a sphere), the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface is a topological invariant: $\\int_{A} K dA = 2\\pi\\chi$, where $\\chi$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For a single closed surface of spherical topology, the Euler characteristic is $\\chi=2$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{A} K dA = 2\\pi(2) = 4\\pi\n$$\nThis result is independent of the sphere's radius $R$. Consequently, the contribution to the free energy from Gaussian curvature, $\\int_{A} \\bar{\\kappa} K dA = 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa}$, is a constant for a fixed topology. It does not influence the minimization of $F$ with respect to $R$ and can be treated as a constant offset.\n\nNow we evaluate the remaining terms. Since the integrand is constant over the sphere's surface for a given $R$, the integral becomes the product of the integrand and the total area $A = 4\\pi R^{2}$:\n$$\nF(R) = \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( 2\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right) - C_{0} \\right)^{2} + \\gamma_{0} \\right] (4\\pi R^{2}) + 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa}\n$$\nExpanding the expression:\n$$\nF(R) = 4\\pi R^{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{R^{2}} - \\frac{4C_{0}}{R} + C_{0}^{2} \\right) + \\gamma_{0} \\right] + 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa}\n$$\n$$\nF(R) = 4\\pi \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( 4 - 4C_{0}R + C_{0}^{2}R^{2} \\right) + \\gamma_{0}R^{2} \\right] + 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa}\n$$\n$$\nF(R) = 4\\pi \\left[ 2\\kappa - 2\\kappa C_{0}R + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}C_{0}^{2}R^{2} + \\gamma_{0}R^{2} \\right] + 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa}\n$$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $R$, we obtain the total free energy as a function of the radius:\n$$\nF(R) = \\left( 2\\pi\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 4\\pi\\gamma_{0} \\right)R^{2} - 8\\pi\\kappa C_{0}R + (8\\pi\\kappa + 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa})\n$$\nThe term $(8\\pi\\kappa + 4\\pi\\bar{\\kappa})$ is constant with respect to $R$.\n\n**Task 2: Minimization of $F(R)$ and Analysis**\n\nTo find the optimal radius $R^{*}$ that minimizes the free energy, we compute the derivative of $F(R)$ with respect to $R$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dR} = \\frac{d}{dR} \\left[ \\left( 2\\pi\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 4\\pi\\gamma_{0} \\right)R^{2} - 8\\pi\\kappa C_{0}R + \\text{constant} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dR} = 2 \\left( 2\\pi\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 4\\pi\\gamma_{0} \\right)R - 8\\pi\\kappa C_{0}\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{dF}{dR} = 0$ at $R=R^{*}$:\n$$\n(4\\pi\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 8\\pi\\gamma_{0})R^{*} = 8\\pi\\kappa C_{0}\n$$\nSolving for $R^{*}$:\n$$\nR^{*}(\\gamma_{0}) = \\frac{8\\pi\\kappa C_{0}}{4\\pi\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 8\\pi\\gamma_{0}} = \\frac{2\\kappa C_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{0}}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a minimum, the second derivative must be positive:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}F}{dR^{2}} = 4\\pi\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 8\\pi\\gamma_{0} = 4\\pi(\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{0})\n$$\nThe bending modulus $\\kappa$ is a material property and must be positive ($\\kappa > 0$). Surface tension $\\gamma_{0}$ is typically non-negative ($\\gamma_{0} \\ge 0$). Given that the problem states $C_{0} > 0$, the term $C_{0}^{2}$ is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{d^{2}F}{dR^{2}} > 0$, and $R^{*}$ is a stable minimum.\n\nFor a physically meaningful radius, we require $R^{*} > 0$. Since the denominator $\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{0}$ is positive, the numerator $2\\kappa C_{0}$ must be positive. As $\\kappa > 0$, this requires $C_{0} > 0$. A positive spontaneous curvature signifies a preference for curving outwards, which is consistent with the formation of a spherical droplet.\n\nNext, we check the limit as $\\gamma_{0} \\to 0$:\n$$\nR^{*}(\\gamma_{0} \\to 0) = \\lim_{\\gamma_{0} \\to 0} \\frac{2\\kappa C_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2} + 2\\gamma_{0}} = \\frac{2\\kappa C_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}} = \\frac{2}{C_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the correct zero-tension optimum. In the absence of surface tension ($\\gamma_{0}=0$), the energy is minimized when the bending energy term alone is minimized. This occurs when the term $(2H - C_{0})^{2}$ is zero, which implies $2H - C_{0} = 0$, or $H = C_{0}/2$. For a sphere, $H=1/R$, so $1/R = C_{0}/2$, which gives $R = 2/C_{0}$.\n\n**Task 3: Expansion for Small $\\gamma_{0}$**\n\nWe expand $R^{*}(\\gamma_{0})$ in powers of the small dimensionless parameter $\\frac{\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}}$.\nFirst, we factor out $\\kappa C_{0}^{2}$ from the denominator:\n$$\nR^{*}(\\gamma_{0}) = \\frac{2\\kappa C_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}}\\right)} = \\frac{2}{C_{0}} \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nUsing the Taylor series expansion $(1+x)^{-1} = 1 - x + x^{2} - O(x^{3})$ for small $x$, with $x = \\frac{2\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}}$:\n$$\nR^{*}(\\gamma_{0}) \\approx \\frac{2}{C_{0}} \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{2\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nR^{*}(\\gamma_{0}) \\approx \\frac{2}{C_{0}} - \\frac{4\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{3}} + \\frac{8\\gamma_{0}^{2}}{\\kappa^{2}C_{0}^{5}}\n$$\nThis is the expansion to second order. Qualitatively, the leading-order correction to the zero-tension radius $R_{0} = 2/C_{0}$ is the linear term, $-\\frac{4\\gamma_{0}}{\\kappa C_{0}^{3}}$. For a positive surface tension $\\gamma_{0} > 0$, this correction is negative. Thus, increasing the bare surface tension $\\gamma_{0}$ from zero causes the optimal droplet radius $R^{*}$ to decrease. This is physically expected: the surface tension term $\\gamma_{0} A = 4\\pi\\gamma_{0}R^{2}$ penalizes area and favors smaller radii.

The equilibrium configuration of the surfactant monolayer in the tensionless limit ($\\sigma=0$) is dictated by the minimization of the Helfrich bending energy, which yields the condition:\n$$2H = C_{0}$$\nwhere $H$ is the mean curvature and $C_{0}$ is the spontaneous curvature.\n\nThe geometric relationship between the area per molecule on the measured headgroup surface, $a_{h}$, and the area per molecule on the neutral surface, $a_{n}$, is given by the linear-order parallel-surface transformation:\n$$a_{h} = a_{n}(1 + 2z_{h}H)$$\nwhere $z_{h}$ is the fixed geometric offset from the neutral surface to the headgroup surface. A crucial assumption is that in the tensionless state, the area per molecule on the neutral surface, $a_{n}$, relaxes to its preferred (stress-free) value, which we denote as $a_{n}^{*}$.\n\nWe analyze the system in two distinct states.\n\nState 0: The initial balanced microemulsion.\nThe problem states that at balance, the spontaneous curvature is zero, $C_{0}^{(0)} = 0$. Applying the equilibrium condition, we find the mean curvature:\n$$2H^{(0)} = C_{0}^{(0)} = 0 \\implies H^{(0)} = 0$$\nSubstituting this zero mean curvature into the parallel-surface relation for state 0 gives:\n$$a_{h}^{(0)} = a_{n}^{(0)}(1 + 2z_{h}H^{(0)}) = a_{n}^{(0)}(1 + 0) = a_{n}^{(0)}$$\nSince this is a tensionless state, the area on the neutral surface is the preferred area, $a_{n}^{(0)} = a_{n}^{*}$. Therefore, we find a direct link between the measured headgroup area at balance and the preferred neutral surface area:\n$$a_{h}^{(0)} = a_{n}^{*}$$\n\nState 1: After the addition of alcohol cosurfactant.\nThe system remains under tensionless conditions. The equilibrium condition is now:\n$$2H^{(1)} = C_{0}^{(1)} \\implies H^{(1)} = \\frac{C_{0}^{(1)}}{2}$$\nThe parallel-surface relation for state 1 is:\n$$a_{h}^{(1)} = a_{n}^{(1)}(1 + 2z_{h}H^{(1)})$$\nThe problem assumes that the preferred neutral surface area $a_{n}^{*}$ does not change upon alcohol addition. As the system is tensionless, the area on the neutral surface adjusts to this preferred value, so $a_{n}^{(1)} = a_{n}^{*}$. Using our result from state 0, we can write $a_{n}^{(1)} = a_{h}^{(0)}$.\nSubstituting $a_{n}^{(1)} = a_{h}^{(0)}$ and $H^{(1)} = C_{0}^{(1)}/2$ into the parallel-surface relation for state 1, we obtain:\n$$a_{h}^{(1)} = a_{h}^{(0)} \\left(1 + 2z_{h}\\left(\\frac{C_{0}^{(1)}}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$a_{h}^{(1)} = a_{h}^{(0)} (1 + z_{h}C_{0}^{(1)})$$\nThis equation relates the new spontaneous curvature $C_{0}^{(1)}$ to the given experimental and geometric parameters. We now solve for $C_{0}^{(1)}$ to fulfill the first part of the task:\n$$\\frac{a_{h}^{(1)}}{a_{h}^{(0)}} = 1 + z_{h}C_{0}^{(1)}$$\n$$z_{h}C_{0}^{(1)} = \\frac{a_{h}^{(1)}}{a_{h}^{(0)}} - 1 = \\frac{a_{h}^{(1)} - a_{h}^{(0)}}{a_{h}^{(0)}}$$\nThe derived expression for the spontaneous curvature in state 1 is:\n$$C_{0}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{z_{h}} \\left( \\frac{a_{h}^{(1)} - a_{h}^{(0)}}{a_{h}^{(0)}} \\right)$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the change in spontaneous curvature, $\\Delta C_{0} = C_{0}^{(1)} - C_{0}^{(0)}$. Since $C_{0}^{(0)} = 0$, the change is simply equal to $C_{0}^{(1)}$:\n$$\\Delta C_{0} = C_{0}^{(1)} = \\frac{a_{h}^{(1)} - a_{h}^{(0)}}{z_{h}a_{h}^{(0)}}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $a_{h}^{(0)} = 0.62\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2}$, $a_{h}^{(1)} = 0.54\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2}$, and $z_{h} = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$\\Delta C_{0} = \\frac{0.54\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2} - 0.62\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2}}{(0.40\\ \\mathrm{nm})(0.62\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2})}$$\n$$\\Delta C_{0} = \\frac{-0.08\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{2}}{0.248\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{3}}$$\n$$\\Delta C_{0} = -0.3225806... \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta C_{0} \\approx -0.323\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the addition of alcohol induces a spontaneous curvature that is concave with respect to the water phase, which is physically consistent with a reduction in the headgroup area.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.323}$$", "id": "2920888"}]}
