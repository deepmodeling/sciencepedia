A key parameter describing this phenomenon is the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), the concentration above which micelles form in significant numbers.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the thermodynamics of micellization in a dilute aqueous solution. The standard Gibbs free energy of transfer for a single surfactant monomer from the aqueous phase to a spherical micelle with an aggregation number $N$ (i.e., composed of $N$ monomers) is given by the function $\\Delta g^\\circ(N)$. This free energy is determined by a balance of competing energetic and entropic contributions. For this problem, we model this relationship as:\n$$\n\\Delta g^\\circ(N) = A N^{1/3} + B N^{-1/3} - U\n$$\nwhere $A$, $B$, and $U$ are positive constants at a given temperature $T$. The term $A N^{1/3}$ represents the cumulative repulsive interactions between surfactant headgroups, which increase as the micelle grows and the headgroups are forced closer. The term $B N^{-1/3}$ represents the unfavorable surface energy at the hydrocarbon-water interface, which decreases per monomer as the micelle grows. The term $-U$ represents the favorable hydrophobic effect of removing the hydrocarbon tail from the aqueous environment, assumed to be independent of micelle size.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  The system will spontaneously form micelles of a single, optimal aggregation number, $N^*$. This optimal number is the value of $N$ that *minimizes* the standard Gibbs free energy per monomer, $\\Delta g^\\circ(N)$.\n2.  The CMC, expressed as the mole fraction of free monomers $X_{CMC}$, can be determined using the pseudo-phase separation model. This model equates the chemical potential of a monomer in the aqueous solution at the CMC with the standard chemical potential of a monomer within the optimized micellar \"pseudo-phase\". This leads to the thermodynamic relationship:\n    $$\n    \\Delta g^\\circ(N^*) = k_B T \\ln(X_{CMC})\n    $$\n    where $\\Delta g^\\circ(N^*)$ is the minimized free energy per monomer, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nYour task is to derive the expression for the critical micelle concentration, $X_{CMC}$, in terms of the model parameters $A$, $B$, $U$, and the thermal energy $k_B T$.", "solution": "We have \n$$\\Delta g^\\circ(N)=A N^{1/3}+B N^{-1/3}-U.$$ \nTo find the optimal aggregation number $N^*$, set the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\Delta g^\\circ}{dN} = \\frac{A}{3}N^{-2/3}-\\frac{B}{3}N^{-4/3}=0.$$\nMultiply by $3N^{4/3}$:\n$$A\\,N^{2/3}-B=0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad N^{2/3}=\\frac{B}{A} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad N^*=\\Bigl(\\frac{B}{A}\\Bigr)^{3/2}.$$\nEvaluate $\\Delta g^\\circ$ at $N^*$:\n$$\\Delta g^\\circ(N^*) = A\\Bigl(\\frac{B}{A}\\Bigr)^{1/2} + B\\Bigl(\\frac{B}{A}\\Bigr)^{-1/2}-U = \\sqrt{AB}+\\sqrt{AB}-U = 2\\sqrt{AB}-U.$$\nThe pseudo-phase separation model gives $\\Delta g^\\circ(N^*)=k_B T \\ln(X_{CMC})$, so\n$$\\ln(X_{CMC})=\\frac{2\\sqrt{AB}-U}{k_B T} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad X_{CMC}=\\exp\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{2\\sqrt{AB}-U}{k_B T}\\Bigr).$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{2\\sqrt{AB}-U}{k_B T}\\Bigr)}$$", "id": "365241"}, {"introduction": "While our first model captured the general balance of forces, the primary engine driving micellization in aqueous solutions is the hydrophobic effect. This exercise [@problem_id:527265] isolates this crucial factor, asking you to derive the famous logarithmic relationship between surfactant tail length and the CMC. By connecting molecular architecture to macroscopic behavior, you will quantify how making a surfactant more hydrophobic dramatically increases its tendency to self-assemble.", "problem": "The self-assembly of surfactant molecules into micelles in an aqueous solution is a cornerstone of colloid science. For a homologous series of ionic or non-ionic surfactants with the same hydrophilic headgroup but differing lengths of their hydrocarbon tails, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is observed to decrease exponentially with the length of the tail. This behavior can be understood using the pseudo-phase model of micellization.\n\nIn this model, the micelles are treated as a distinct phase in equilibrium with the free surfactant monomers in the solution. The standard Gibbs free energy of micellization per monomer, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{mic}$, is related to the mole fraction of monomers at the CMC, $X_{CMC}$, by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_{mic} = k_B T \\ln(X_{CMC})\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe primary driving force for micellization is the hydrophobic effect. The contribution of the hydrocarbon tail to the free energy of micellization can be modeled as a linear function of the number of carbon atoms, $n_c$, in the tail. The total standard Gibbs free energy of micellization is thus given by:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_{mic} = n_c \\cdot g_{CH_2} + g_{const}\n$$\nHere, $g_{CH_2}$ is the free energy increment for transferring one methylene (–CH$_2$–) group from the aqueous solution to the non-polar interior of the micelle. The term $g_{const}$ accounts for the contributions from the hydrophilic headgroup and the terminal methyl (–CH$_3$) group, and is therefore considered constant for a given homologous series at a fixed temperature.\n\nFor a series of such surfactants, experimental data often shows a linear relationship when $\\ln(X_{CMC})$ is plotted against the number of carbon atoms, $n_c$, in the tail.
