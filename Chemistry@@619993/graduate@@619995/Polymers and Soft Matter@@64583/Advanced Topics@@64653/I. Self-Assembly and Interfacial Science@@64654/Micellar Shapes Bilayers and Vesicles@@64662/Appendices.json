This analysis is based on fundamental geometric constraints related to space-filling within the aggregate core.\n\nThe guiding principles are:\n$1$. The hydrophobic tails of the amphiphiles must pack together to form a core that has no \"voids\" (is space-filling).\n$2$. Each molecule occupies an area $a_{0}$ at the core-water interface.\n$3$. The radius of the hydrophobic core, or any of its principal dimensions, cannot exceed the fully extended length of the hydrophobic chain, $l_{c}$.\n\nLet us first define the dimensionless packing parameter, $p$. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of the hydrophobic tail, $v$, to the volume of a cylinder with a base area equal to the optimal headgroup area, $a_{0}$, and a height equal to the maximum chain length, $l_{c}$. This definition encapsulates the intrinsic molecular geometry.\n$$p = \\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}}$$\nThe value of $p$ determines the preferred curvature of the interface and thus the overall geometry of the aggregate.\n\nTo derive the relationship between $p$ and the aggregate geometry, consider an aggregate of $N$ molecules. The total volume of the hydrophobic core is $V_{core} = Nv$, and the total surface area of this core is $A_{interface} = Na_{0}$. The ratio of the total core volume to its total surface area is therefore a property of the molecule itself, independent of the aggregate size $N$:\n$$\\frac{V_{core}}{A_{interface}} = \\frac{Nv}{Na_{0}} = \\frac{v}{a_{0}}$$\nWe now analyze the volume-to-area ratio for aggregates of different simple geometries, each with a core radius $R$. The fundamental physical constraint is that $R \\le l_{c}$.\n\nCase $1$: Spherical Micelles\nThe core is a sphere of radius $R$. Its volume is $V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}$ and its surface area is $A_{sphere} = 4\\pi R^{2}$. The volume-to-area ratio for the sphere is:\n$$\\frac{V_{sphere}}{A_{sphere}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}}{4\\pi R^{2}} = \\frac{R}{3}$$\nEquating the geometric ratio with the molecular ratio:\n$$\\frac{v}{a_{0}} = \\frac{R}{3} \\implies R = \\frac{3v}{a_{0}}$$\nApplying the constraint $R \\le l_{c}$:\n$$\\frac{3v}{a_{0}} \\le l_{c} \\implies \\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}} \\le \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThus, for spherical micelles to form, the packing parameter must satisfy $p \\le \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nCase $2$: Cylindrical Micelles\nThe core is a long cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$. Neglecting the contributions from the end caps, the volume is $V_{cyl} = \\pi R^{2} L$ and the surface area is $A_{cyl} = 2\\pi R L$. The volume-to-area ratio for the cylinder is:\n$$\\frac{V_{cyl}}{A_{cyl}} = \\frac{\\pi R^{2} L}{2\\pi R L} = \\frac{R}{2}$$\nEquating with the molecular ratio:\n$$\\frac{v}{a_{0}} = \\frac{R}{2} \\implies R = \\frac{2v}{a_{0}}$$\nApplying the constraint $R \\le l_{c}$:\n$$\\frac{2v}{a_{0}} \\le l_{c} \\implies \\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis condition, $p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, defines the upper limit for cylindrical geometry. Since spheres are favored for $p \\le \\frac{1}{3}$, cylindrical micelles are stable in the intermediate range $\\frac{1}{3}  p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nCase $3$: Bilayers and Vesicles\nFor a planar bilayer, the radius of curvature is infinite. An ideal packing of molecules into a planar layer occurs when the molecular shape is cylindrical. A perfect cylinder of height $l_c$ and base area $a_0$ has a volume of $a_0 l_c$. If the actual molecular volume $v$ is equal to this value, then $p = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} = 1$. This corresponds to a stable planar bilayer. Structures with lower, but still near-unity, packing parameters form vesicles (closed bilayers) which have a large radius of curvature. This geometry is favored in the range $\\frac{1}{2}  p \\le 1$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the aggregate geometry is predicted by the value of $p$ as follows:\n- Spherical micelles: $p \\le \\frac{1}{3}$ ($g=1$)\n- Cylindrical micelles: $\\frac{1}{3}  p \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ ($g=2$)\n- Bilayers and vesicles: $\\frac{1}{2}  p \\le 1$ ($g=3$)\n- Inverted (reverse) structures: $p > 1$ ($g=4$)\n\nWe are given the following molecular parameters:\n- $v = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{3}$\n- $a_{0} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2}$\n- $l_{c} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nWe now compute the value of the packing parameter $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{c}} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{3}}{(0.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{2})(1.6\\,\\mathrm{nm})} = \\frac{0.5}{0.96}$$\n$$p = \\frac{25}{48} \\approx 0.520833...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, we get $p = 0.5208$.\n\nThis value falls within the range for bilayers and vesicles, as $0.5  0.5208 \\le 1$.\nTherefore, the favored aggregate geometry is a bilayer or vesicle, which corresponds to the geometry code $g=3$.
