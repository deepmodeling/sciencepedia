It requires the derivation of a fundamental relationship in surface science from first principles and its subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall proceed.\n\nThe system involves a three-phase contact line where solid (s), liquid (l), and vapor (v) phases meet. The equilibrium state is governed by the minimization of the total free energy. This can be analyzed from two equivalent perspectives: a mechanical balance of forces at the contact line and a thermodynamic consideration of the work required to alter the interfacial areas.\n\nFirst, we consider the mechanical equilibrium condition at the three-phase contact line, as required by point (i) of the problem. At the contact line, there are three interfacial tensions acting. These are the solid-vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sv}$; the solid-liquid interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sl}$; and the liquid-vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{lv}$. Each tension represents a force per unit length acting along the respective interface. For the system to be in mechanical equilibrium, the vector sum of these forces must be zero. We are concerned with the components of these forces parallel to the solid substrate.\n\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{sv}$ acts along the solid-vapor interface.\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{sl}$ acts along the solid-liquid interface, opposing the $\\gamma_{sv}$ force.\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{lv}$ acts tangentially to the liquid-vapor interface at an angle $\\theta$, the equilibrium contact angle, with respect to the solid substrate.\n\nThe balance of forces parallel to the substrate is thus given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Young's equation. It relates the interfacial tensions to the macroscopic contact angle.\n\nSecond, we consider the thermodynamic definition of the work of adhesion, $W_{ad}$, as stipulated by point (ii) of the problem. The work of adhesion is defined as the reversible work required per unit area to separate a solid-liquid interface, creating a new solid-vapor interface and a new liquid-vapor interface in its place. According to the first law of thermodynamics for an isothermal, reversible process, the work done on the system, $W_{ad}$, equals the change in the total surface free energy of the system, $\\Delta G_{surf}$.\n\nConsider a system with an initial area of contact $A$ between the solid and liquid. The initial surface free energy of this interface is $G_{initial} = \\gamma_{sl} A$. We perform work to separate the liquid from the solid over this area $A$. The final state consists of a solid-vapor interface of area $A$ and a liquid-vapor interface of area $A$. The final surface free energy is $G_{final} = \\gamma_{sv} A + \\gamma_{lv} A$.\n\nThe work of adhesion per unit area, $W_{ad}$, is the work done divided by the area $A$:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\frac{G_{final} - G_{initial}}{A} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{sv} A + \\gamma_{lv} A) - (\\gamma_{sl} A)}{A}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the Dupre equation for the work of adhesion:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} - \\gamma_{sl}\n$$\nThis $W_{ad}$ is precisely the minimum reversible work per unit area to separate the liquid from the solid.\n\nThe problem requires an expression for $W_{ad}$ in terms of only $\\gamma_{lv}$ and $\\theta$. We can achieve this by combining the Young equation and the Dupre equation. From Young's equation, we can express the difference $(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl})$ as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the Dupre equation:\n$$\nW_{ad} = (\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}) + \\gamma_{lv} = (\\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta) + \\gamma_{lv}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\gamma_{lv}$, we arrive at the desired expression, known as the Young-Dupre equation:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\gamma_{lv} (1 + \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThis equation correctly relates the thermodynamic work of adhesion to the macroscopically measurable quantities of liquid-vapor surface tension and contact angle.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression numerically for the given system. The provided values are:\nLiquid-vapor surface tension, $\\gamma_{lv} = 72.0\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$.\nEquilibrium contact angle, $\\theta = 108^\\circ$.\n\nFirst, we address the units.

The derivation must be from first principles, utilizing the definition of the total interfacial free energy and the local application of Young's equation.\n\nThe system's total interfacial free energy, $E$, is given by the sum of the energies of the three interfaces:\n$$E = \\gamma_{lv}A_{lv} + \\gamma_{sl}A_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv}A_{sv}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{lv}$, $\\gamma_{sl}$, and $\\gamma_{sv}$ are the liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor interfacial tensions, respectively, and $A_{lv}$, $A_{sl}$, and $A_{sv}$ are the corresponding interfacial areas.\n\nThe total area of the substrate surface under consideration is constant, $A_{sub} = A_{sl} + A_{sv}$.

At the advancing front, the local contact angle is the advancing angle, $\\theta_A$, and at the receding front, it is the receding angle, $\\theta_R$. The problem states that we can apply Young's equation locally at the contact line: $\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{lv}\\cos\\theta$. This implies that the term $(\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv})$ is not a single constant for the entire droplet but depends on the local contact angle $\\theta$ around the perimeter of the contact line.\n\nWe must evaluate the change in energy, $dE$, for an infinitesimal displacement $dx$. The term $\\gamma_{lv} \\frac{dA_{lv}}{dx}$ relates to the change in the droplet's surface area. For a quasi-static process where the droplet volume is conserved and the footprint radius $a$ is kept constant, this change is a second-order effect compared to the change in substrate energy and can be neglected. This is a standard simplification in this context. Thus, we consider the change in substrate energy, $dE_{sub} = d((\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv})A_{sl})$.\n\nLet us consider the displacement of the circular contact line of radius $a$ by a small distance $dx$ in the positive $x$-direction.
