The objectives are clear and logically sequenced.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be formulated.\n\nWe begin with the governing equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid in the creeping flow regime (low Reynolds number), which are the Stokes and continuity equations:\n$$ \\nabla p = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0 $$\nUnder the lubrication approximation, the Stokes equations reduce to $\\nabla_{xy}p = \\eta \\partial_{zz} \\mathbf{v}_{xy}$ and $\\partial_z p = 0$, implying $p=p(x,y,t)$. Integrating for the velocity profile with no-slip boundary conditions at $z = \\pm h/2$ (immobilized interfaces) yields a parabolic (Poiseuille) profile. The volumetric flux vector $\\mathbf{q}=(q_x,q_y)$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile across the film thickness:\n$$ \\mathbf{q} = -\\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} p $$\nThe evolution of the film thickness $h(x,y,t)$ is governed by mass conservation: $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{xy} \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$.\n\nThe crucial step is to determine the in-film pressure $p$. The pressure difference across a curved interface is given by the Young-Laplace equation, and it is modified by the disjoining pressure. The normal stress balance is $p_{\\mathrm{liquid}} - p_{\\mathrm{gas}} = \\sigma \\cdot (\\text{curvature}) + \\Pi(h)$. For small slopes, the curvature is $\\nabla_{xy}^2 z$. The top interface is at $z \\approx h/2$ and the bottom at $z \\approx -h/2$. The standard convention is $p_{\\mathrm{liquid}} = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h + \\Pi(h)$. However, a more stable convention, often used in the field, defines a repulsive disjoining pressure as lowering the liquid pressure: $p_{\\mathrm{liquid}} = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\sigma \\nabla_{xy}^2 h - \\Pi(h)$. Let's adopt this convention.\nThe in-film pressure is:\n$$ p(x,y,t) = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h) - \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h $$\nIn the nearly flat interior of the lamella, the curvature term is negligible, so the in-film pressure is approximately $p \\approx p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h)$. The volumetric flux is driven by the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\mathbf{q} = -\\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} (p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h) - \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h) = \\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} (\\Pi(h) + \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h) $$\nSubstituting this flux into the conservation equation gives the lubrication-scale evolution equation for $h(x, y, t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{xy} \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} (\\Pi(h) + \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h) \\right] = 0 $$\n\nNext, we consider arrested drainage. Drainage is the flow from the film to the Plateau borders. It stops when the film pressure equals the Plateau border pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{film}} = p_{\\mathrm{PB}}$. In the flat interior ($ \\nabla^2_{xy} h = 0$), $p_{\\mathrm{film}} = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h_e)$. We are given $p_{\\mathrm{PB}} = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - p_c$. Equating them gives $p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h_e) = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - p_c$. The mechanical condition for arrested drainage at equilibrium thickness $h_e$ is therefore:\n$$ \\Pi(h_e) = p_c $$\n\nTo investigate stability, we linearize the evolution equation around the uniform equilibrium state $h=h_e$. Let $h(x,y,t) = h_e + \\delta h(x,y,t)$ for a small perturbation $\\delta h$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} \\cdot \\left[ \\nabla_{xy} (\\Pi(h_e) + \\Pi'(h_e)\\delta h + \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} \\delta h) \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} \\left[ \\Pi'(h_e)\\nabla^2_{xy}(\\delta h) + \\sigma \\nabla^4_{xy}(\\delta h) \\right] = 0 $$\nWe analyze stability with a Fourier mode perturbation, $\\delta h \\propto \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + \\omega t)$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector ($k=|\\mathbf{k}|$) and $\\omega$ is the growth rate. This yields the dispersion relation for $\\omega(k)$:\n$$ \\omega + \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} [ \\Pi'(h_e)(-k^2) + \\sigma(k^4) ] = 0 $$\n$$ \\omega(k) = \\frac{k^2 h_e^3}{12\\eta} [ \\Pi'(h_e) - \\sigma k^2 ] $$\nThe equilibrium is stable if $\\omega(k)  0$ for all $k0$. For long-wavelength perturbations ($k \\to 0$), the $\\sigma k^2$ term is negligible. The stability is determined by the sign of $\\Pi'(h_e)$. For $\\omega(k)  0$, we require:\n$$ \\Pi'(h_e) = \\frac{d\\Pi}{dh}\\bigg|_{h_e}  0 $$\nThis is the criterion for linear stability. Physically, it means that for the film to be stable, the repulsive disjoining pressure must increase as the film thins (i.e., as $h$ decreases).\n\nFinally, we apply these conditions to the specified disjoining pressure: $\\Pi(h) = \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h)$, with $\\Pi_0  0, \\kappa  0$.\nThe equilibrium condition $\\Pi(h_e) = p_c$ becomes:\n$$ \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h_e) = p_c $$\nSolving for $h_e$:\n$$ \\exp(-\\kappa h_e) = \\frac{p_c}{\\Pi_0} \\implies -\\kappa h_e = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_c}{\\Pi_0}\\right) $$\n$$ h_e = -\\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_c}{\\Pi_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pi_0}{p_c}\\right) $$\nFor a physically meaningful equilibrium thickness ($h_e > 0$), the argument of the logarithm must be greater than $1$. This gives the parameter constraint for existence of the equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{\\Pi_0}{p_c} > 1 \\implies \\Pi_0 > p_c $$\nThis means the maximum possible repulsive disjoining pressure (as $h \\to 0$) must exceed the applied suction pressure.\n\nNow, we check the stability of this equilibrium. The stability criterion is $\\Pi'(h_e)  0$. We compute the derivative of $\\Pi(h)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Pi}{dh} = \\frac{d}{dh} \\left[ \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h) \\right] = -\\kappa \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h) $$\nSince $\\kappa  0$, $\\Pi_0  0$, and the exponential term is always positive, we have $\\frac{d\\Pi}{dh}  0$ for all $h  0$. Thus, the stability condition $\\Pi'(h_e)  0$ is always satisfied for this purely repulsive disjoining pressure.\nTherefore, a stable equilibrium thickness $h_e$ exists if and only if $\\Pi_0 > p_c$, and its value is given by the expression derived above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pi_0}{p_c}\\right)}$$", "id": "2914383"}, {"introduction": "The macroscopic rheology of an emulsion is a direct reflection of its underlying droplet microstructure.

The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective and all necessary definitions and relations to achieve it. The use of a lognormal distribution is standard for describing particle and droplet sizes. The definition of the monodisperse reference system is unambiguous. The language is objective and formal. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of the storage moduli is equal to the ratio of the total interfacial area per unit sample volume, $S_{v}$. We define the factor $F(c)$ as:\n$$\nF(c) = \\frac{G^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{poly}}}{G^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{mono}}} = \\frac{(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{poly}}}{(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{mono}}}\n$$\nLet us first derive a general expression for $S_{v}$. The total volume of the dispersed phase in a total sample volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is $V_{d} = \\phi V_{\\mathrm{total}}$. Let $p(R)$ be the number-weighted probability density function of the droplet radius $R$. The total number of droplets in the sample is $N_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The total volume of droplets is the sum of individual droplet volumes:\n$$\nV_{d} = N_{\\mathrm{total}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^{3}\\right) p(R) \\,dR = N_{\\mathrm{total}} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\right) \\langle R^{3} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\langle R^{k} \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} R^{k} p(R) \\,dR$ is the $k$-th number-weighted moment of the radius distribution.\nFrom this, we can express the total number of droplets as:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{V_{d}}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\langle R^{3} \\rangle} = \\frac{\\phi V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\langle R^{3} \\rangle}\n$$\nThe total interfacial area, $A_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the surface areas of all droplets:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{total}} = N_{\\mathrm{total}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (4\\pi R^{2}) p(R) \\,dR = N_{\\mathrm{total}} (4\\pi) \\langle R^{2} \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{\\phi V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\langle R^{3} \\rangle} (4\\pi \\langle R^{2} \\rangle) = 3\\phi V_{\\mathrm{total}} \\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle}{\\langle R^{3} \\rangle}\n$$\nThe total interfacial area per unit sample volume for the polydisperse system, $(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{poly}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{poly}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_{\\mathrm{total}}} = 3\\phi \\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle}{\\langle R^{3} \\rangle}\n$$\nFor the reference monodisperse system, all droplets have radius $R_{m}$. The moments are simply $\\langle R^{k} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{mono}} = R_{m}^{k}$. Thus, its specific surface area is:\n$$\n(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{mono}} = 3\\phi \\frac{R_{m}^{2}}{R_{m}^{3}} = \\frac{3\\phi}{R_{m}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the monodisperse radius $R_{m}$ is chosen such that the total dispersed volume per droplet is conserved, which implies $R_{m}^{3} = \\langle R^{3} \\rangle$. Therefore, $R_{m} = (\\langle R^{3} \\rangle)^{1/3}$. Substituting this into the expression for $(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{mono}}$ gives:\n$$\n(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\frac{3\\phi}{(\\langle R^{3} \\rangle)^{1/3}}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio $F(c)$:\n$$\nF(c) = \\frac{(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{poly}}}{(S_{v})_{\\mathrm{mono}}} = \\frac{3\\phi \\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle}{\\langle R^{3} \\rangle}}{\\frac{3\\phi}{(\\langle R^{3} \\rangle)^{1/3}}} = \\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle}{(\\langle R^{3} \\rangle)^{2/3}}\n$$\nThis expression must be related to the coefficient of variation, $c$. The droplet radius $R$ is lognormally distributed, such that $X = \\ln R$ is a normal random variable with mean $\\mu$ and variance $s^{2}$, i.e., $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, s^{2})$. The $k$-th moment of a lognormal distribution is given by:\n$$\n\\langle R^{k} \\rangle = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(kX)] = \\exp(k\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}k^{2}s^{2})\n$$\nUsing this formula, we calculate the required moments:\n$$\n\\langle R^{2} \\rangle = \\exp(2\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}(2^{2})s^{2}) = \\exp(2\\mu + 2s^{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\langle R^{3} \\rangle = \\exp(3\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}(3^{2})s^{2}) = \\exp(3\\mu + \\frac{9}{2}s^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $F(c)$:\n$$\nF(c) = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + 2s^{2})}{\\left(\\exp\\left(3\\mu + \\frac{9}{2}s^{2}\\right)\\right)^{2/3}} = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + 2s^{2})}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\left(3\\mu + \\frac{9}{2}s^{2}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + 2s^{2})}{\\exp(2\\mu + 3s^{2})} = \\exp(-s^{2})\n$$\nThe final step is to relate the logarithmic variance $s^{2}$ to the coefficient of variation $c$. The definition is $c^{2} = \\operatorname{Var}(R)/(\\mathbb{E}[R])^{2}$. The variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(R) = \\langle R^{2} \\rangle - \\langle R \\rangle^{2}$. So,\n$$\nc^{2} = \\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle - \\langle R \\rangle^{2}}{\\langle R \\rangle^{2}} = \\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle}{\\langle R \\rangle^{2}} - 1\n$$\nWe need the first moment $\\langle R \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle R \\rangle = \\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}s^{2})\n$$\nNow compute the ratio $\\langle R^{2} \\rangle / \\langle R \\rangle^{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\langle R^{2} \\rangle}{\\langle R \\rangle^{2}} = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + 2s^{2})}{(\\exp(\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}))^{2}} = \\frac{\\exp(2\\mu + 2s^{2})}{\\exp(2\\mu + s^{2})} = \\exp(s^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $c^{2}$:\n$$\nc^{2} = \\exp(s^{2}) - 1\n$$\nThis gives a direct relation between $\\exp(s^{2})$ and $c^{2}$:\n$$\n\\exp(s^{2}) = 1 + c^{2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into our expression for $F(c) = \\exp(-s^{2})$:\n$$\nF(c) = \\exp(-s^{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(s^{2})} = \\frac{1}{1+c^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the multiplicative factor by which polydispersity modifies the storage modulus, expressed as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the coefficient of variation $c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1+c^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2914390"}]}
