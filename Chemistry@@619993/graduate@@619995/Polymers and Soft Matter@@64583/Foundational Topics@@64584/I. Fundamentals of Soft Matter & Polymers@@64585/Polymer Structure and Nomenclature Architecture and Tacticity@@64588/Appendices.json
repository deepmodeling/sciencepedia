The pentad region is complex, but the signals are grouped into five statistical classes based on the number of meso dyads in the underlying four-dyad sequence. The normalized integral fractions for these classes are reported as follows: the `mmmm` class (4 meso) has 0.442, the `mmmr` class (3 meso) has 0.392, the `mmrr` class (2 meso) has 0.144, the `mrrr` class (1 meso) has 0.019, and the `rrrr` class (0 meso) has 0.003.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a three-step analysis of stereochemical sequence probabilities.\n\n**1. Computation of Meso Dyad Probability $P(m)$**\n\nIn a long polymer chain, the fraction of meso dyads, denoted $P(m)$, can be determined directly from the observed triad fractions without assuming any underlying statistical model for chain growth. A triad is a sequence of two adjacent dyads. An `mm` triad contains two meso dyads. An `mr` triad contains one meso and one racemo dyad. An `rr` triad contains two racemo dyads. The total population of meso dyads arises from the `mm` and `mr` triads.\n\nThe fraction of meso dyads is a weighted sum of the triad fractions. From first principles, considering any dyad placement in the chain, it can be the first or second dyad of a triad. The probability of picking a meso dyad at random is:\n$$ P(m) = [\\mathrm{mm}] + \\frac{1}{2} [\\mathrm{mr}] $$\nSimilarly, the probability of a racemo dyad is:\n$$ P(r) = [\\mathrm{rr}] + \\frac{1}{2} [\\mathrm{mr}] $$\nThese must sum to unity: $P(m) + P(r) = [\\mathrm{mm}] + [\\mathrm{mr}] + [\\mathrm{rr}] = 1$.\n\nUsing the given triad fractions:\n$[\\mathrm{mm}] = 0.660$\n$[\\mathrm{mr}] = 0.300$\n$[\\mathrm{rr}] = 0.040$\n\nThe meso dyad probability is:\n$$ P(m) = 0.660 + \\frac{1}{2}(0.300) = 0.660 + 0.150 = 0.810 $$\nThe racemo dyad probability is:\n$$ P(r) = 1 - P(m) = 1 - 0.810 = 0.190 $$\n\n**2. Bernoullian Model for Pentad Class Fractions**\n\nThe Bernoullian model assumes that the probability of forming a meso or racemo dyad is independent of the stereochemistry of the preceding dyads. A pentad is a sequence of four consecutive dyads. The problem defines five pentad classes based on the number of meso dyads ($k=4,3,2,1,0$) in the four-dyad sequence. Under the Bernoullian model, where each dyad formation is an independent event, the probability of a sequence having $k$ meso dyads and $4-k$ racemo dyads is given by the binomial probability formula. The five classes' probabilities, $f_{pred}$, are therefore given by the terms in the expansion of $(P(m) + P(r))^4$:\n\n- $f(\\mathrm{mmmm})_{pred}$: Probability of $4$ meso, $0$ racemo dyads.\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mmmm})_{pred} = \\binom{4}{4} P(m)^4 P(r)^0 = P(m)^4 $$\n- $f(\\mathrm{mmmr})_{pred}$: Probability of $3$ meso, $1$ racemo dyad.\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mmmr})_{pred} = \\binom{4}{3} P(m)^3 P(r)^1 = 4 P(m)^3 P(r) $$\n- $f(\\mathrm{mmrr})_{pred}$: Probability of $2$ meso, $2$ racemo dyads.\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mmrr})_{pred} = \\binom{4}{2} P(m)^2 P(r)^2 = 6 P(m)^2 P(r)^2 $$\n- $f(\\mathrm{mrrr})_{pred}$: Probability of $1$ meso, $3$ racemo dyads.\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mrrr})_{pred} = \\binom{4}{1} P(m)^1 P(r)^3 = 4 P(m) P(r)^3 $$\n- $f(\\mathrm{rrrr})_{pred}$: Probability of $0$ meso, $4$ racemo dyads.\n$$ f(\\mathrm{rrrr})_{pred} = \\binom{4}{0} P(m)^0 P(r)^4 = P(r)^4 $$\n\nUsing $P(m) = 0.810$ and $P(r) = 0.190$, we calculate the predicted fractions:\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mmmm})_{pred} = (0.810)^4 = 0.43046721 $$\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mmmr})_{pred} = 4(0.810)^3(0.190) = 0.40389516 $$\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mmrr})_{pred} = 6(0.810)^2(0.190)^2 = 0.14211126 $$\n$$ f(\\mathrm{mrrr})_{pred} = 4(0.810)(0.190)^3 = 0.02222316 $$\n$$ f(\\mathrm{rrrr})_{pred} = (0.190)^4 = 0.00130321 $$\nThe sum of these predicted fractions is exactly $1$, as expected from the binomial expansion $(P(m)+P(r))^4=1^4=1$.\n\n**3. Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) Calculation**\n\nThe RMSD quantifies the deviation between the observed ($f_{obs}$) and predicted ($f_{pred}$) pentad class fractions. It is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (f_{pred, i} - f_{obs, i})^2} $$\nwhere $N=5$ is the number of pentad classes.\n\nThe observed fractions are:\n$f(\\mathrm{mmmm})_{obs} = 0.442$\n$f(\\mathrm{mmmr})_{obs} = 0.392$\n$f(\\mathrm{mmrr})_{obs} = 0.144$\n$f(\\mathrm{mrrr})_{obs} = 0.019$\n$f(\\mathrm{rrrr})_{obs} = 0.003$\n\nWe now compute the squared differences for each class:\n- Class 1 (`mmmm`): $(0.43046721 - 0.442)^2 = (-0.01153279)^2 \\approx 0.000133005$\n- Class 2 (`mmmr`): $(0.40389516 - 0.392)^2 = (0.01189516)^2 \\approx 0.000141495$\n- Class 3 (`mmrr`): $(0.14211126 - 0.144)^2 = (-0.00188874)^2 \\approx 0.000003567$\n- Class 4 (`mrrr`): $(0.02222316 - 0.019)^2 = (0.00322316)^2 \\approx 0.000010389$\n- Class 5 (`rrrr`): $(0.00130321 - 0.003)^2 = (-0.00169679)^2 \\approx 0.000002879$\n\nThe sum of squared differences (SSD) is:\n$$ \\mathrm{SSD} \\approx 0.000133005 + 0.000141495 + 0.000003567 + 0.000010389 + 0.000002879 = 0.000291335 $$\n\nThe mean squared deviation (MSD) is:\n$$ \\mathrm{MSD} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SSD}}{N} = \\frac{0.000291335}{5} = 0.000058267 $$\n\nFinally, the root-mean-square deviation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSD} = \\sqrt{0.000058267} \\approx 0.007633275 $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the RMSD is $0.007633$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.007633}\n$$", "id": "2925437"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple linear chains, polymer science offers a vast zoo of complex architectures, such as the highly branched, globular structures known as hyperbranched polymers.

Quantitative Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) on a sufficiently high molar-mass sample yields the mole fractions of these units as $x_{D} = 0.362$, $x_{L} = 0.450$, and $x_{T} = 0.188$, with $x_{D} + x_{L} + x_{T} = 1$.\n\nStarting from first principles of architectural classification for $AB_{2}$-type hyperbranched polymers and using only general constraints that any sensible scalar measure of branching must satisfy (correct normalization in the perfectly dendritic limit, vanishing in the ideal linear-chain limit, and invariance under generation for perfect dendrimers), derive a linear-in-composition expression for the degree of branching in terms of $x_{D}$, $x_{L}$, and $x_{T}$, and then evaluate it numerically for the measured composition.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of polymer chemistry, specifically the architectural analysis of hyperbranched polymers. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the degree of branching, denoted as $DB$, for a hyperbranched polymer synthesized from an $AB_{2}$ monomer. The problem provides the mole fractions of dendritic ($x_{D}$), linear ($x_{L}$), and terminal ($x_{T}$) units and imposes several constraints on the form of the $DB$ expression.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. The expression for $DB$ must be a linear function of the compositions $x_{D}$, $x_{L}$, and $x_{T}$.\n2. In the limit of a perfect dendrimer, $DB$ must equal $1$.\n3. In the limit of an ideal linear chain, $DB$ must equal $0$.\n\nLet us postulate the most general linear expression for $DB$ in terms of the mole fractions:\n$$DB = c_{D}x_{D} + c_{L}x_{L} + c_{T}x_{T}$$\nwhere $c_{D}$, $c_{L}$, and $c_{T}$ are coefficients to be determined by applying the given constraints.\n\nFirst Constraint: Ideal Linear Chain Limit\nAn ideal linear polymer of high molar mass, formed from $AB_{2}$ monomers, consists almost exclusively of linear repeating units. In this limit, the number of dendritic units is zero ($N_{D} = 0$), and the number of terminal units is negligible compared to the total number of units ($N_{T} \\ll N$). Therefore, the mole fractions approach the following values:\n$$x_{D} \\to 0$$\n$$x_{L} \\to 1$$\n$$x_{T} \\to 0$$\nIn this limit, the degree of branching must be zero ($DB = 0$). Substituting these values into our general expression:\n$$0 = c_{D}(0) + c_{L}(1) + c_{T}(0)$$\n$$c_{L} = 0$$\nThis determines the coefficient for the linear unit fraction. The expression for $DB$ simplifies to:\n$$DB = c_{D}x_{D} + c_{T}x_{T}$$\n\nSecond Constraint: Perfect Dendrimer Limit\nA perfect dendrimer is a hyperbranched structure containing no linear units. Therefore, for any perfect dendrimer, $N_{L} = 0$, which implies $x_{L} = 0$. The mole fractions of dendritic and terminal units must sum to unity, as they are the only types of units present:\n$$x_{D} + x_{T} = 1$$\nIn this limit, the degree of branching must be one ($DB = 1$). Substituting this into our simplified expression for $DB$:\n$$1 = c_{D}x_{D} + c_{T}x_{T}$$\nUsing the relation $x_{T} = 1 - x_{D}$, we can write:\n$$1 = c_{D}x_{D} + c_{T}(1 - x_{D})$$\n$$1 = c_{T} + (c_{D} - c_{T})x_{D}$$\nThis equation must hold true for any perfect dendrimer, regardless of its generation (i.e., for any valid value of $x_{D}$ where $x_{L}=0$). For this to be universally true, the coefficient of the variable term $x_{D}$ must be zero, and the constant term must be one. This gives us two conditions:\n1. $c_{D} - c_{T} = 0 \\implies c_{D} = c_{T}$\n2. $c_{T} = 1$\n\nFrom these conditions, we find that $c_{D} = 1$ and $c_{T} = 1$.\n\nHaving determined all three coefficients ($c_{D}=1$, $c_{L}=0$, $c_{T}=1$), we can now write the unique linear expression for the degree of branching that satisfies all the problem's constraints:\n$$DB = (1)x_{D} + (0)x_{L} + (1)x_{T}$$\n$$DB = x_{D} + x_{T}$$\nThis expression, known as the Fréchet or Hölter definition of the degree of branching, is derived rigorously from the stated first principles and constraints.\n\nNumerical Evaluation\nThe problem provides the following experimentally determined mole fractions from a high molar-mass sample:\n$$x_{D} = 0.362$$\n$$x_{L} = 0.450$$\n$$x_{T} = 0.188$$\nWe note that the sum is $0.362 + 0.450 + 0.188 = 1.000$, as required.\n\nSubstituting the values of $x_{D}$ and $x_{T}$ into our derived formula for $DB$:\n$$DB = 0.362 + 0.188$$\n$$DB = 0.550$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Since each monomer is difunctional, the total number of functional groups is $2N_{0}$.\n\nThe extent of reaction, $p$, is defined as the fraction of functional groups that have reacted. The number of reacted functional groups is thus $p \\times (2N_{0})$.\nEach reaction, which forms one covalent bond linking two monomer units, consumes two functional groups. Therefore, the number of bonds formed is equal to half the number of reacted functional groups.\n$$\\text{Number of bonds formed} = \\frac{p(2N_{0})}{2} = pN_{0}$$\nThe formation of each bond reduces the total number of molecules in the system by one. Therefore, the number of molecules remaining at time $t$, $N(t)$, is the initial number of molecules, $N_{0}$, minus the number of bonds formed.\n$$N(t) = N_{0} - pN_{0} = N_{0}(1-p)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $N(t)$ into the definition of $X_{n}$, we obtain the Carothers equation for a linear, stoichiometric system:\n$$X_{n} = \\frac{N_{0}}{N_{0}(1-p)} = \\frac{1}{1-p}$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of the extent of reaction, $p^{\\star}$, needed to achieve a target number-average degree of polymerization of $X_{n}^{\\star} = 100$.\n$$100 = \\frac{1}{1-p^{\\star}}$$\nSolving for $p^{\\star}$:\n$$1 - p^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n$$p^{\\star} = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\nPart (b): Non-linear Step-Growth Polymerization and Gelation\n\nNext, we analyze the modified system with a mixture of $A_{2}$ and $A_{3}$ monomers reacting with $B_{2}$ monomers.

For an $A-B$ polymerization with a stoichiometric ratio of functional groups $r = \\frac{\\sum N_{A} f_{A}}{\\sum N_{B} f_{B}} \\le 1$, the critical extent of reaction of A-groups, $p_{A,c}$, at the gel point is given by:\n$$p_{A,c}^{2} = \\frac{1}{r(f_{w,A} - 1)(f_{w,B} - 1)}$$\nIn this problem, the initial feed is adjusted for stoichiometric equality of total $A$ and $B$ functional groups, which means $r=1$. Also, with $r=1$, the extents of reaction of $A$ and $B$ groups are equal, $p_{A} = p_{B} = p$. The criterion simplifies to:\n$$p_{c}^{2} = \\frac{1}{(f_{w,A} - 1)(f_{w,B} - 1)}$$\nHere, $f_{w,A}$ and $f_{w,B}$ are the weight-average functionalities of the A-group and B-group monomers, respectively.
