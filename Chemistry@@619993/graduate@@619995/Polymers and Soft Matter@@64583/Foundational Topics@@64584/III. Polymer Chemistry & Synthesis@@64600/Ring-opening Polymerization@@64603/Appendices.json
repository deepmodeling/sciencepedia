All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem is valid.\n\nProceeding with the solution.\n\nThe thermodynamic criterion for a spontaneous polymerization process is that the change in Gibbs free energy of polymerization, $\\Delta G_p$, must be negative. The relationship is given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G_p = \\Delta H_p - T \\Delta S_p\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_p$ is the enthalpy of polymerization, $\\Delta S_p$ is the entropy of polymerization, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe ceiling temperature, $T_c$, is defined as the temperature at which the polymerization and depolymerization rates are equal, meaning the system is at equilibrium. At this temperature, the Gibbs free energy change is zero, $\\Delta G_p = 0$.\n$$\n0 = \\Delta H_p - T_c \\Delta S_p\n$$\nSolving for $T_c$ yields:\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{\\Delta H_p}{\\Delta S_p}\n$$\nPolymerization is thermodynamically favorable only for temperatures below the ceiling temperature, $T < T_c$, as this condition ensures $\\Delta G_p < 0$ (since both $\\Delta H_p$ and $\\Delta S_p$ are negative).\n\nFirst, we calculate the ceiling temperature for each monomer.\n\nFor monomer $1$:\n$$\nT_{c,1} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{p,1}}{\\Delta S_{p,1}} = \\frac{-55\\,000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{-120\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}} = \\frac{5500}{12}\\ \\mathrm{K} = \\frac{1375}{3}\\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 458.33\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n\nFor monomer $2$:\n$$\nT_{c,2} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{p,2}}{\\Delta S_{p,2}} = \\frac{-35\\,000\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{-70\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}} = \\frac{3500}{7}\\ \\mathrm{K} = 500\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n\nComparing the two ceiling temperatures:\n$$\nT_{c,2} = 500\\ \\mathrm{K} > T_{c,1} \\approx 458.33\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nTherefore, monomer $2$ has the higher ceiling temperature.

The assumptions (fast initiation, constant active site concentration, negligible termination/transfer) are standard for this model. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary kinetic data and physical parameters to perform the requested derivations and calculations. It is expressed in objective, quantitative language and is free of contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Kinetic Equation and Calculation of $k_{\\mathrm{app}}$**\n\nThe rate of monomer consumption in a ring-opening polymerization, under the given conditions, is described by the rate law:\n$$ -\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = k_p [P^*] [M] $$\nwhere $k_p$ is the rate constant for propagation, $[P^*]$ is the concentration of active chain ends (living polymer chains), and $[M]$ is the monomer concentration.\nThe problem states that initiation is much faster than propagation and that termination and transfer are negligible. This defines a living polymerization where all initiator molecules are consumed rapidly to form active chains. With a monofunctional initiator, the concentration of active chains is constant throughout the polymerization and equal to the initial initiator concentration, $[I]_0$.\n$$ [P^*] = [I]_0 = \\text{constant} $$\nThe rate law thus simplifies to a pseudo-first-order form:\n$$ -\\frac{d[M]}{dt} = (k_p [I]_0) [M] = k_{\\mathrm{app}} [M] $$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{app}} = k_p [I]_0$ is the apparent first-order rate constant.\nTo find the relationship between monomer concentration and time, we separate variables and integrate from the initial condition ($t=0$, $[M]=[M]_0$) to an arbitrary time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{[M]_0}^{[M](t)} \\frac{d[M]}{[M]} = -\\int_{0}^{t} k_{\\mathrm{app}} \\, dt $$\n$$ \\ln([M](t)) - \\ln([M]_0) = -k_{\\mathrm{app}} t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0}\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{app}} t $$\nThe conversion, $x(t)$, is defined as $x(t) = 1 - \\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0}$. Rearranging this gives $\\frac{[M](t)}{[M]_0} = 1 - x(t)$. Substituting this into the integrated rate law yields the desired linearizable relationship:\n$$ \\ln\\left(1 - x(t)\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{app}} t $$\nThis equation indicates that a plot of $\\ln(1 - x)$ versus $t$ will be a straight line with a slope of $-k_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and an intercept of $0$.\n\nTo determine $k_{\\mathrm{app}}$, the provided time-conversion data is transformed. A linear regression of $y = \\ln(1 - x)$ on $t$ is performed. The slope of this fit, $m$, is equal to $-k_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The data points for the fit are ($t_i$, $\\ln(1-x_i)$), excluding the trivial point at $t=0$. Performing a standard least-squares linear regression on the $9$ non-zero data points yields a slope of $m = -2.9986 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nTherefore, the apparent rate constant is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{app}} = -m = 2.9986 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, gives $k_{\\mathrm{app}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of $M_n(x)$**\n\nThe number-average degree of polymerization, $DP_n$, is the average number of monomer units per polymer chain. For an ideal living polymerization, it ispools the ratio of the amount of monomer consumed to the total amount of chains formed (which equals the amount of initiator used).\n$$ DP_n = \\frac{\\text{moles of monomer consumed}}{\\text{moles of initiator}} = \\frac{([M]_0 - [M])V}{[I]_0 V} = \\frac{[M]_0(1 - [M]/[M]_0)}{[I]_0} $$\nUsing the definition of conversion $x$, this simplifies to:\n$$ DP_n(x) = \\frac{[M]_0 x}{[I]_0} $$\nThe number-average molar mass, $M_n$, is the mass of an average polymer chain. Each chain consists of $DP_n$ monomer units and one initiator fragment.\n$$ M_n = DP_n \\cdot M_0 + M_i $$\nSubstituting the expression for $DP_n(x)$:\n$$ M_n(x) = \\left(\\frac{[M]_0 M_0}{[I]_0}\\right) x + M_i $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = a x + b$, where $y=M_n(x)$, and the variable is the conversion $x$. Therefore, $M_n$ is a linear function of conversion $x$.\nThe slope of this relationship is $\\frac{d M_n}{dx} = \\frac{[M]_0 M_0}{[I]_0}$.\nThe intercept (at $x=0$) is $M_n(0) = M_i$. This corresponds to the molar mass of the initiated species before any propagation has occurred.\n\n**Part 3: Dispersity $\\mathrm{Đ}(x)$ and its Trend**\n\nFor an ideal living polymerization with instantaneous initiation, the chain length distribution follows a Poisson distribution. The dispersity, $\\mathrm{Đ}$ (also known as the polydispersity index, PDI), is given by the ratio of the weight-average molar mass $M_w$ to the number-average molar mass $M_n$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Đ} = \\frac{M_w}{M_n} = 1 + \\frac{DP_n}{(DP_n + 1)^2} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $DP_n$ as a function of conversion $x$ gives the functional form of $\\mathrm{Đ}(x)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Đ}(x) = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{[M]_0 x}{[I]_0}}{\\left(\\frac{[M]_0 x}{[I]_0} + 1\\right)^2} $$\nTo analyze the trend, consider the behavior of $\\mathrm{Đ}$ as conversion $x$ increases from $0$ towards $1$. As $x$ increases, $DP_n$ increases linearly. The term $\\frac{DP_n}{(DP_n+1)^2}$ is maximized when $DP_n=1$, where it equals $0.25$, giving a maximum dispersity of $\\mathrm{Đ}_{max} = 1.25$. For $DP_n > 1$, this term decreases as $DP_n$ increases. In this problem, the ratio $\\frac{[M]_0}{[I]_0} = \\frac{2.00}{0.0200} = 100$. Thus, $DP_n=1$ occurs at a very low conversion of $x = 1/100 = 0.01$. For nearly the entire course of the reaction ($x>0.01$), $DP_n$ is greater than $1$. Therefore, the qualitative trend is that after a very early peak, the dispersity $\\mathrm{Đ}$ decreases monotonically as conversion $x$ increases, approaching $1$ as $DP_n$ becomes large. A dispersity approaching $1$ is the hallmark of a narrow molar mass distribution, characteristic of a living polymerization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.00 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "2926666"}, {"introduction": "Ideal polymerization models provide a crucial foundation, but real-world synthesis often involves non-ideal factors such as impurities.

The data provided are self-consistent and realistic for a laboratory-scale bulk polymerization. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as required.\n\n**1) Mechanistic Explanation of Impurity Effects**\n\nIn an ideal ring-opening polymerization initiated by a monofunctional alcohol ($I$, e.g., benzyl alcohol), each initiator molecule is intended to start one polymer chain. The process begins with the activation of the initiator's hydroxyl group, forming an active alkoxide species. This alkoxide then nucleophilically attacks the monomer ($M$), opening its ring and propagating the polymer chain. In the absence of termination or chain transfer, the number of polymer chains is fixed by the initial number of initiator molecules.\n\nThe presence of a protic impurity like water ($W$) introduces an additional source of hydroxyl groups. The critical condition given is that reversible chain transfer is much faster than propagation ($k_{\\mathrm{tr}}[\\text{prot}] \\gg k_{p}[M]$). This kinetic regime is often called \"living polymerization with reversible transfer\" or \"immortal polymerization\". In this scenario, the active site (the propagating alkoxide end-group, $P_n-O^-$) can rapidly react with any available protic species (a species with an $-OH$ group). This includes the intended initiator ($I$), the impurity ($W$), and the hydroxyl end-groups of other, dormant polymer chains ($P_m-OH$).\n\nThe reversible exchange reactions are:\n$P_n-O^- + I-OH \\rightleftharpoons P_n-OH + I-O^-$\n$P_n-O^- + W-OH \\rightleftharpoons P_n-OH + W-O^-$\n$P_n-O^- + P_m-OH \\rightleftharpoons P_n-OH + P_m-O^-$\n\nBecause these exchange reactions are much faster than the propagation step ($P-O^- + M \\rightarrow P'-O^-$), the single active site is effectively shared among all available protic sites. The system behaves as if every protic molecule—be it the intended initiator or the water impurity—has an equal opportunity to be activated and start a chain. Consequently, both benzyl alcohol and water function as initiators. The total number of growing polymer chains is therefore not determined solely by the concentration of the designed initiator, $[I]_{0}$, but by the sum of the concentrations of all protic species present at the start of the reaction. Thus, the total concentration of polymer chains, $[N_{chains}]$, is given by $[N_{chains}] = [I]_{0} + [W]_{0}$. Addition of water increases the total number of chains formed.\n\n**2) Derivation of Number-Average Molecular Weight ($M_{n}$)**\n\nThe number-average degree of polymerization, $X_{n}$, is defined as the total number of monomer units incorporated into polymer chains divided by the total number of polymer chains.\n\n$$X_{n} = \\frac{\\text{moles of consumed monomer}}{\\text{moles of polymer chains}}$$\n\nIn terms of concentrations, for a homogeneous system of volume $V$:\n$$X_{n} = \\frac{([M]_{0} - [M]) \\cdot V}{[N_{chains}] \\cdot V} = \\frac{\\Delta[M]}{[N_{chains}]}$$\nGiven the monomer conversion $x$, the concentration of consumed monomer is $\\Delta[M] = x[M]_{0}$.\nTherefore, the expression for $X_n$ is:\n$$X_{n} = \\frac{x[M]_{0}}{[N_{chains}]}$$\n\nThe number-average molecular weight, $M_{n}$, is the product of the number-average degree of polymerization and the molar mass of a single monomer unit, $M_{0}$. We are instructed to ignore the mass of end-groups.\n\n$$M_{n} = X_{n} \\cdot M_{0} = \\frac{x[M]_{0}}{[N_{chains}]} M_{0}$$\n\nNow we apply this general formula to the two specified cases.\n\n**Case A: Without Water Impurity**\nIn the absence of water, the only protic species capable of initiating chains is the designed initiator, benzyl alcohol. The total concentration of chains is equal to the initial initiator concentration.\n$$[N_{chains}] = [I]_{0}$$\nSubstituting this into the general expression for $M_{n}$ gives the molecular weight in the ideal, water-free case, which we denote $M_{n, \\text{ideal}}$:\n$$M_{n, \\text{ideal}} = \\frac{x[M]_{0}}{[I]_{0}} M_{0}$$\n\n**Case B: With Water Impurity**\nWhen water is present, and under the specified regime of fast reversible transfer, both benzyl alcohol and water act as initiators. The total concentration of polymer chains is the sum of their initial concentrations.\n$$[N_{chains}] = [I]_{0} + [W]_{0}$$\nSubstituting this into the general expression for $M_{n}$ gives the molecular weight in the presence of water, denoted $M_{n, \\text{actual}}$:\n$$M_{n, \\text{actual}} = \\frac{x[M]_{0}}{[I]_{0} + [W]_{0}} M_{0}$$\nThese derived expressions show that for a fixed conversion, the presence of the protic impurity increases the denominator, thereby decreasing the resulting molecular weight.\n\n**3) Numerical Calculation of $\\Delta M_{n}$**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the drop in number-average molecular weight, $\\Delta M_{n}$, caused by the water impurity.\n$$\\Delta M_{n} = M_{n, \\text{ideal}} - M_{n, \\text{actual}}$$\nUsing the expressions derived above:\n$$\\Delta M_{n} = \\left( \\frac{x[M]_{0}}{[I]_{0}} \\right) M_{0} - \\left( \\frac{x[M]_{0}}{[I]_{0} + [W]_{0}} \\right) M_{0}$$\nWe can factor out the common terms:\n$$\\Delta M_{n} = x[M]_{0} M_{0} \\left( \\frac{1}{[I]_{0}} - \\frac{1}{[I]_{0} + [W]_{0}} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. First, ensure consistent units.\n$[I]_{0} = 20.0 \\text{ mmol/L} = 0.0200 \\text{ mol/L}$\n$[W]_{0} = 5.00 \\text{ mmol/L} = 0.00500 \\text{ mol/L}$\n$[M]_{0} = 2.00 \\text{ mol/L}$\n$x = 0.900$\n$M_{0} = 144.13 \\text{ g/mol}$\n\nFirst calculate the two molecular weights separately.\n$$M_{n, \\text{ideal}} = \\frac{(0.900)(2.00 \\text{ mol/L})}{0.0200 \\text{ mol/L}} \\cdot (144.13 \\text{ g/mol}) = 90.0 \\cdot 144.13 \\text{ g/mol} = 12971.7 \\text{ g/mol}$$\n$$M_{n, \\text{actual}} = \\frac{(0.900)(2.00 \\text{ mol/L})}{(0.0200 + 0.00500) \\text{ mol/L}} \\cdot (144.13 \\text{ g/mol}) = \\frac{1.80}{0.0250} \\cdot 144.13 \\text{ g/mol} = 72.0 \\cdot 144.13 \\text{ g/mol} = 10377.36 \\text{ g/mol}$$\n\nThe drop in molecular weight is:\n$$\\Delta M_{n} = 12971.7 \\text{ g/mol} - 10377.36 \\text{ g/mol} = 2594.34 \\text{ g/mol}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the precision of the input data gives $2594$ g/mol.\nThe numerical value of the drop is $2594$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2594}$$", "id": "2926739"}]}
