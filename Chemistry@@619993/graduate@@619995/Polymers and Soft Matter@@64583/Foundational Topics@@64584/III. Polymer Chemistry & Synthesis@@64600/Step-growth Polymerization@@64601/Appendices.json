The formation of each linkage, such as an ester bond, can proceed through different pathways, which has implications for reaction conditions and potential side products.

The reaction involves an equimolar mixture of a dicarboxylic acid, $\\text{HOOC-R-COOH}$, and a diol, $\\text{HO-R'-OH}$. The dicarboxylic acid is sourced with its natural isotopic abundance of oxygen (predominantly ${}^{16}\\text{O}$). The diol, however, has been specially prepared as a mixture of labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, the mole fraction of hydroxyl groups in the total diol population that are isotopically labeled as ${}^{18}\\text{O-H}$ is denoted by $x_{18}$, where $0 < x_{18} < 1$. The remaining fraction of hydroxyl groups, $(1-x_{18})$, are the naturally abundant ${}^{16}\\text{O-H}$.\n\nTwo plausible mechanisms are proposed for the fundamental esterification step:\n- **Mechanism I (Acyl-Oxygen Cleavage):** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of a diol oxygen on the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid, followed by the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen single bond of the carboxylic acid group.\n- **Mechanism II (Alkyl-Oxygen Cleavage):** The reaction proceeds via protonation of a diol hydroxyl group, followed by nucleophilic attack by a carboxylic acid oxygen on the adjacent carbon atom of the diol, leading to the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond of the diol.\n\nYou may assume that the principle of equal reactivity for all functional groups holds, and you should neglect any kinetic isotope effects (i.e., ${}^{16}\\text{O-H}$ and ${}^{18}\\text{O-H}$ groups are equally reactive).

Since the dicarboxylic acid is taken as naturally abundant (treated here as unlabeled relative to the variable $x_{18}$ in the diol), the probability that a given water molecule contains ${}^{18}\\text{O}$ from the acid is effectively zero, while all water molecules contain ${}^{16}\\text{O}$.

Therefore, the oxygen atom in each water molecule comes from the diol hydroxyl group. Under equal reactivity, the probability that the departing hydroxyl oxygen is ${}^{18}\\text{O}$ is $x_{18}$ and that it is ${}^{16}\\text{O}$ is $1-x_{18}$.
