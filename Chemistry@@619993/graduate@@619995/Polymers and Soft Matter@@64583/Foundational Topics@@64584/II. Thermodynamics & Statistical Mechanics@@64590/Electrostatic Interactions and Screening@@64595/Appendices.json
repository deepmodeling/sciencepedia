It is a standard exercise in mathematical physics applied to soft matter.

The boundary conditions are $\\phi(x, y, 0) = 0$ and $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\to 0$ as $|\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe employ the method of images. The problem is linear, so the principle of superposition is valid. We seek a solution in the half-space $z>0$ by considering an equivalent problem in the full space ($-\\infty < z < \\infty$) with an appropriate arrangement of image charges that satisfies the boundary condition at $z=0$.\n\nFirst, we identify the fundamental solution to the homogeneous equation, also known as the Green's function, which represents the potential from a point charge in an infinite, screened medium. The potential $\\phi_{\\text{source}}(\\mathbf{r})$ due to a charge $Q$ at a position $\\mathbf{r}'$ in an infinite medium with permittivity $\\varepsilon$ and inverse Debye length $\\kappa$ is the Yukawa potential:\n$$ \\phi_{\\text{source}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} $$\nThis function satisfies $(\\nabla^2 - \\kappa^2)\\phi_{\\text{source}} = -(Q/\\varepsilon)\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$.\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition $\\phi(x,y,0)=0$, we place an image charge $q_{img}$ at the mirror position $\\mathbf{r}_{img} = (0, 0, -d)$. The total potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ in the region $z>0$ is the superposition of the potential from the real charge $q$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ and the image charge $q_{img}$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{img}$:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{0}|)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{0}|} + \\frac{q_{img}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{img}|)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{img}|} $$\nFor this potential to be a solution in $z>0$, it must satisfy the governing equation within this domain. The source of the first term is at $\\mathbf{r}_0$ (in the domain) and the source of the second term is at $\\mathbf{r}_{img}$ (outside the domain). Therefore, for any $\\mathbf{r}$ with $z>0$, the second term is a solution to the homogeneous equation $(\\nabla^2 - \\kappa^2)\\phi = 0$. The superposition thus correctly satisfies the inhomogeneous equation inside the domain $z>0$.\n\nNow we must enforce the boundary condition $\\phi(x,y,0)=0$. For any point $\\mathbf{r}_{plane}=(x,y,0)$ on the plane $z=0$, the distance to the real charge is $|\\mathbf{r}_{plane}-\\mathbf{r}_{0}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(0-d)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+d^2}$. The distance to the image charge is $|\\mathbf{r}_{plane}-\\mathbf{r}_{img}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(0-(-d))^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+d^2}$. The distances are identical.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the potential at $z=0$:\n$$ \\phi(x,y,0) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+d^2})}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+d^2}} (q + q_{img}) $$\nFor this to equal zero for all $x$ and $y$, we must have $q+q_{img}=0$, which implies $q_{img}=-q$.\n\nThus, the unique potential in the region $z>0$ is given by:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{0}|)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{0}|} - \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{img}|)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{img}|} \\right) $$\n\nThe electrostatic force $\\mathbf{F}$ on the real charge $q$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{0}$ is due to the electric field created by all other sources. In the image charge method, this field is precisely the field generated by the image charge, evaluated at the position of the real charge.

The force on the real charge is $\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E}_{img}(\\mathbf{r}_{0})$.\n$$ \\mathbf{F} = -q \\nabla \\phi_{img}(\\mathbf{r}) \\bigg|_{\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_{0}} $$\nBy symmetry, the force must be directed along the $z$-axis. We need to compute only the $z$-component of the force, $F_z$.\n$$ F_{z} = -q \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{img}}{\\partial z} \\bigg|_{\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_{0}} $$\nLet us compute the derivative. Let $R = |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{img}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+d)^2}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{img}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa R)}{R} \\right) $$\nUsing the chain rule and product rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa R)}{R} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{-\\kappa \\exp(-\\kappa R)}{R} - \\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa R)}{R^2} \\right) \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa R)}{R^2} (1+\\kappa R) \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z} $$\nThe partial derivative of $R$ with respect to $z$ is $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial z} = \\frac{z+d}{R}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{img}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\left( -\\frac{\\exp(-\\kappa R)}{R^2} (1+\\kappa R) \\frac{z+d}{R} \\right) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{(z+d)(1+\\kappa R)}{R^3} \\exp(-\\kappa R) $$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the position of the real charge, $\\mathbf{r}_{0}=(0,0,d)$. At this point, $x=0$, $y=0$, $z=d$.\nThe distance $R$ becomes $R = \\sqrt{0^2+0^2+(d+d)^2} = 2d$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{img}}{\\partial z} \\bigg|_{\\mathbf{r}_{0}} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{(d+d)(1+\\kappa (2d))}{(2d)^3} \\exp(-\\kappa (2d)) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{img}}{\\partial z} \\bigg|_{\\mathbf{r}_{0}} = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon} \\frac{2d(1+2\\kappa d)}{8d^3} \\exp(-2\\kappa d) = \\frac{q(1+2\\kappa d)}{16\\pi\\varepsilon d^2} \\exp(-2\\kappa d) $$\nFinally, the $z$-component of the force on the charge $q$ is:\n$$ F_{z} = -q \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{img}}{\\partial z} \\bigg|_{\\mathbf{r}_{0}} \\right) = -q \\left( \\frac{q(1+2\\kappa d)}{16\\pi\\varepsilon d^2} \\exp(-2\\kappa d) \\right) $$\n$$ F_{z} = -\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon d^2} (1+2\\kappa d) \\exp(-2\\kappa d) $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is attractive, directed towards the grounded plane (in the negative $z$-direction), as expected for a charge and its opposite-signed image.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\varepsilon d^2}(1+2\\kappa d)\\exp(-2\\kappa d)}$$", "id": "2914121"}]}
