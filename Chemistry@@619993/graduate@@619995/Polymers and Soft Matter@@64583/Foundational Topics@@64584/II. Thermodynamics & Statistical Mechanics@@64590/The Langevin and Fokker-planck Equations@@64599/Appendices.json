It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question fundamental to the study of stochastic processes in theoretical chemistry and physics. It requests a derivation from first principles, which is a standard and necessary exercise for understanding the distinction between the Itô and Stratonovich calculi. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nWe are given the Stratonovich stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$\ndx = a(x)\\,dt + b(x)\\circ dW_t\n$$\nwhere $x(t)$ is the state variable, $a(x)$ is the drift coefficient, $b(x)$ is the diffusion coefficient (representing position-dependent mobility), and $dW_t$ is the increment of a standard Wiener process. Our objective is to find the equivalent Itô SDE by analyzing the definition of the Stratonovich integral.\n\nThe integral form of the SDE is:\n$$\nx(t) - x(t_0) = \\int_{t_0}^{t} a(x(s)) \\, ds + \\int_{t_0}^{t} b(x(s)) \\circ dW_s\n$$\nThe core of the problem lies in the interpretation of the stochastic integral. We discretize the time interval $[t_0, t]$ into $N$ subintervals of width $\\Delta t$, where $t_k = t_0 + k\\Delta t$. The Stratonovich integral is defined as the limit of a sum where the integrand is evaluated at the midpoint of each time-step $[t_k, t_{k+1}]$:\n$$\n\\int_{t_0}^{t} b(x(s)) \\circ dW_s = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b\\left(x\\left(\\frac{t_k + t_{k+1}}{2}\\right)\\right) [W(t_{k+1}) - W(t_k)]\n$$\nFor a sufficiently small step size, we can approximate the midpoint evaluation point $x\\left(\\frac{t_k + t_{k+1}}{2}\\right)$ using the average of the process at the endpoints, $\\frac{x(t_k) + x(t_{k+1})}{2}$. Let us denote $x_k = x(t_k)$ and the Wiener increment $\\Delta W_k = W(t_{k+1}) - W(t_k)$. The discrete sum approximating the Stratonovich integral, which we denote $I_S$, is then:\n$$\nI_S \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b\\left(\\frac{x_{k+1} + x_k}{2}\\right) \\Delta W_k\n$$\nTo relate this to the Itô integral, which evaluates the integrand at the start of the interval, $t_k$, we must expand the term $b\\left(\\frac{x_{k+1} + x_k}{2}\\right)$ around the point $x_k$. First, we approximate $x_{k+1}$ using a single discrete step of the SDE itself:\n$$\nx_{k+1} \\approx x_k + a(x_k)\\Delta t + b(x_k)\\Delta W_k\n$$\nUsing this, the argument of $b$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{k+1} + x_k}{2} \\approx \\frac{(x_k + a(x_k)\\Delta t + b(x_k)\\Delta W_k) + x_k}{2} = x_k + \\frac{1}{2}a(x_k)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}b(x_k)\\Delta W_k\n$$\nSince $b(x)$ is assumed to be a smooth function, we perform a Taylor expansion of $b$ around $x_k$. Let $b'(x) = \\frac{db}{dx}$.\n$$\nb\\left(\\frac{x_{k+1} + x_k}{2}\\right) \\approx b\\left(x_k + \\frac{1}{2}a(x_k)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}b(x_k)\\Delta W_k\\right)\n$$\n$$\nb\\left(\\frac{x_{k+1} + x_k}{2}\\right) \\approx b(x_k) + b'(x_k) \\left( \\frac{1}{2}a(x_k)\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}b(x_k)\\Delta W_k \\right) + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta t)^2, (\\Delta W_k)^2)\n$$\nWe substitute this expansion back into the sum for $I_S$:\n$$\nI_S \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left[ b(x_k) + \\frac{1}{2}b'(x_k)b(x_k)\\Delta W_k + \\frac{1}{2}b'(x_k)a(x_k)\\Delta t \\right] \\Delta W_k\n$$\nDistributing the $\\Delta W_k$ term yields:\n$$\nI_S \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b(x_k)\\Delta W_k + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} b(x_k) b'(x_k) (\\Delta W_k)^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} a(x_k) b'(x_k) \\Delta t \\Delta W_k\n$$\nWe now take the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$. The three sums behave as follows:\n1.  The first sum, $\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b(x_k)\\Delta W_k$, is precisely the definition of the Itô integral, where the integrand is evaluated at the left endpoint $t_k$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b(x_k)\\Delta W_k = \\int_{t_0}^{t} b(x(s)) dW_s \\quad (\\text{Itô})\n    $$\n2.  The second sum involves the quadratic variation of the Wiener process. The increments $\\Delta W_k$ are independent random variables with mean $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_k] = 0$ and variance $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_k)^2] = \\Delta t$. In the mean-square sense, the sum $\\sum (\\Delta W_k)^2$ converges to $t - t_0$. Thus, $(\\Delta W_k)^2$ becomes $dt$ in the continuous limit.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} b(x_k) b'(x_k) (\\Delta W_k)^2 = \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\frac{1}{2} b(x(s)) b'(x(s)) ds\n    $$\n3.  The third sum involves the term $\\Delta t \\Delta W_k$, which has a stochastic order of $(\\Delta t)^{3/2}$. This term vanishes faster than the other terms as $\\Delta t \\to 0$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} a(x_k) b'(x_k) \\Delta t \\Delta W_k = 0\n    $$\nCombining these results, the Stratonovich integral is expressed in terms of an Itô integral and a standard Riemann integral:\n$$\n\\int_{t_0}^{t} b(x(s)) \\circ dW_s = \\int_{t_0}^{t} b(x(s)) dW_s + \\int_{t_0}^{t} \\frac{1}{2} b(x(s)) b'(x(s)) ds\n$$\nIn differential notation, this relationship is:\n$$\nb(x) \\circ dW_t = b(x) dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} b(x) b'(x) dt\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the original Stratonovich SDE:\n$$\ndx = a(x) dt + \\left( b(x) dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} b(x) b'(x) dt \\right)\n$$\nWe group the terms proportional to $dt$ to obtain the final Itô form:\n$$\ndx = \\left( a(x) + \\frac{1}{2} b(x) b'(x) \\right) dt + b(x) dW_t\n$$\nThis is the equivalent Itô SDE. The original drift was $a(x)$. The new effective drift in the Itô representation is $a(x) + \\frac{1}{2} b(x) b'(x)$. The additional drift term, also known as the noise-induced or spurious drift, is the correction required when converting from the Stratonovich interpretation, which uses standard calculus rules, to the Itô interpretation. This term is the difference between the Itô drift and the Stratonovich drift:\n$$\na_{\\text{additional}}(x) = \\left( a(x) + \\frac{1}{2}b(x)b'(x) \\right) - a(x) = \\frac{1}{2}b(x)b'(x)\n$$\nThis term arises because the Stratonovich integral implicitly accounts for the correlation between the process $x(t)$ and the noise increment $dW_t$ within an infinitesimal time step, a correlation that the Itô integral, by its forward-point definition, ignores.

Over a small time $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta x \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\eta(t') dt' \\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{2D} \\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\langle \\eta(t') \\rangle dt' = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\eta(t') dt' \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle = 2D \\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\int_0^{\\Delta t} \\langle \\eta(t') \\eta(t'') \\rangle dt' dt''\n$$\nUsing the property $\\langle \\eta(t') \\eta(t'') \\rangle = \\delta(t' - t'')$, the double integral reduces to a single integral:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = 2D \\int_0^{\\Delta t} dt' = 2D \\Delta t\n$$\nHigher-order moments are of order $O((\\Delta t)^{3/2})$ or smaller and can be neglected. Substituting these moments back into the recursion for $\\tau(x_0)$:\n$$\n\\tau(x_0) = \\Delta t + \\tau(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2\\tau}{dx_0^2} (2D \\Delta t)\n$$\nSubtracting $\\tau(x_0)$ from both sides and dividing by $\\Delta t$ yields the ordinary differential equation for the MFPT, often called Dynkin's equation:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2\\tau}{dx_0^2} = -1\n$$\nThis equation must be solved subject to boundary conditions on $\\tau(x_0)$. These conditions are derived from the physical nature of the boundaries at $x_0=0$ and $x_0=L$.\n1. At the absorbing boundary $x_0=L$: If the particle starts at the exit, the time to reach it is zero. Therefore, $\\tau(L) = 0$.\n2. At the reflecting boundary $x_0=0$: A particle at an infinitesimal distance $\\epsilon$ from the wall has the same expectation of exit time as a particle that would be at $-\\epsilon$ in an unbounded system with the same exit at $L$. This symmetry implies that the MFPT must have an extremum at a reflecting wall. Consequently, its derivative must be zero. Thus, $\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0}\\bigg|_{x_0=0} = 0$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary-value problem. Integrating the differential equation once with respect to $x_0$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0} = -\\frac{x_0}{D} + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Applying the reflecting boundary condition at $x_0=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0}\\bigg|_{x_0=0} = -\\frac{0}{D} + C_1 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1 = 0\n$$\nThe equation for the first derivative simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0} = -\\frac{x_0}{D}\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $x_0$ gives the general solution for $\\tau(x_0)$:\n$$\n\\tau(x_0) = \\int \\left( -\\frac{x_0}{D} \\right) dx_0 = -\\frac{x_0^2}{2D} + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. We determine $C_2$ using the absorbing boundary condition at $x_0=L$:\n$$\n\\tau(L) = -\\frac{L^2}{2D} + C_2 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_2 = \\frac{L^2}{2D}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $C_2$ back into the expression for $\\tau(x_0)$ gives the final result:\n$$\n\\tau(x_0) = \\frac{L^2}{2D} - \\frac{x_0^2}{2D}\n$$\nThis can be written in a more compact form. The result is physically consistent: the MFPT is maximal for a particle starting at the reflecting wall ($x_0=0$) and zero for a particle starting at the absorbing exit ($x_0=L$). The time scales as $L^2/D$, which is characteristic of diffusive processes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{L^{2} - x_{0}^{2}}{2D}}\n$$", "id": "2932592"}]}
