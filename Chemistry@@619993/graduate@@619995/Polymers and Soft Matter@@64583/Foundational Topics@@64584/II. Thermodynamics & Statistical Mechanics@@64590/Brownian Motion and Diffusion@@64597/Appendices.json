It describes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a canonical model in statistical physics. The Langevin equation, noise properties, and the quantity to be calculated are all standard and well-defined. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a non-trivial but standard derivation in statistical mechanics, directly relevant to the specified topic. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows.\n\nThe quantity to be calculated is the self-intermediate scattering function, defined as\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\left\\langle \\exp\\!\\big( i q [x(t) - x(0)] \\big) \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nwhere the average $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is over the stationary equilibrium ensemble. The variable of interest is the displacement $\\Delta x(t) = x(t) - x(0)$.\n\nThe provided Langevin equation is a linear stochastic differential equation. The noise term $\\eta(t)$ is a Gaussian process. Since the displacement $\\Delta x(t)$ is a linear functional of the initial position $x(0)$ and the noise history, and since the system is in thermal equilibrium in a harmonic potential (implying $x(0)$ itself follows a Gaussian distribution), the variable $\\Delta x(t)$ is a Gaussian random variable for any fixed $t$.\n\nFor a Gaussian random variable $Y$, the characteristic function is given by the well-known identity:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(i q Y) \\rangle = \\exp\\left(i q \\langle Y \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2} q^2 \\left\\langle (Y - \\langle Y \\rangle)^2 \\right\\rangle \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, $Y = \\Delta x(t) = x(t) - x(0)$. We must first compute its mean and variance in the equilibrium ensemble.\n\nThe mean displacement is $\\langle \\Delta x(t) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(t) - x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(t) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} - \\langle x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\nIn the stationary equilibrium ensemble, the statistical properties are time-independent. The average position is determined by the potential $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$. Since the potential is symmetric about $x=0$, the equilibrium probability distribution $P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(x) \\propto \\exp(-U(x)/k_B T)$ is also symmetric. Thus, the average position is zero: $\\langle x \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0$.\nIn a stationary state, this holds for all time, so $\\langle x(t) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0$.\nTherefore, the mean displacement is zero:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta x(t) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the expression for $F(q,t)$ simplifies to:\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} q^2 \\left\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem is reduced to calculating the mean squared displacement (MSD) in equilibrium, $\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nThe MSD can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle (x(t)-x(0))^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(t)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} - 2 \\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\langle x(0)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nDue to stationarity, the mean squared position is constant in time: $\\langle x(t)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(0)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. This value is the equilibrium variance of the position. From the equipartition theorem for a quadratic degree of freedom, $\\langle U(x) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T$. This gives:\n$$\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_B T}{k}\n$$\nSo, the MSD becomes:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 2 \\langle x(0)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} - 2 \\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} - 2 \\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nTo find the time correlation function $\\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we must solve the Langevin equation.\nThe equation is $\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} = -k x + F_{\\mathrm{rand}}(t)$, where $F_{\\mathrm{rand}}(t) = \\sqrt{2 \\gamma k_B T} \\eta(t)$.\nRewriting it:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{k}{\\gamma} x(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma}} \\eta(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $x(t)$. We define the relaxation time $\\tau_R = \\gamma/k$. The equation is solved using an integrating factor $e^{t/\\tau_R}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( x(t) e^{t/\\tau_R} \\right) = e^{t/\\tau_R} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma}} \\eta(t)\n$$\nIntegrating from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$ gives the formal solution for $x(t)$ given its value $x(0)$ at time $t=0$:\n$$\nx(t) e^{t/\\tau_R} - x(0) e^{0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma}} \\int_0^t e^{t'/\\tau_R} \\eta(t') dt'\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = x(0) e^{-t/\\tau_R} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma}} \\int_0^t e^{-(t-t')/\\tau_R} \\eta(t') dt'\n$$\nNow, we compute the time correlation function by multiplying by $x(0)$ and taking the equilibrium average:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\left\\langle x(0)^2 e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T}{\\gamma}} \\int_0^t e^{-(t-t')/\\tau_R} \\langle x(0) \\eta(t') \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} dt'\n$$\nThe crucial step is to evaluate $\\langle x(0) \\eta(t') \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for $t' > 0$. The position of the particle at time $t=0$, $x(0)$, is determined by the history of the stochastic force for all times prior to $t=0$. The noise $\\eta(t')$ at a future time $t' > 0$ is, by the definition of white noise, uncorrelated with its past values. Therefore, $x(0)$ is statistically independent of $\\eta(t')$ for all $t' > 0$. This principle is known as causality.\n$$\n\\langle x(0) \\eta(t') \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\langle \\eta(t') \\rangle = 0 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThe second term in the expression for $\\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ vanishes. We are left with:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(0)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} e^{-t/\\tau_R} = \\frac{k_B T}{k} e^{-t/\\tau_R}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the MSD:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} - 2 \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{k} e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right) = 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we can assemble the final expression for $F(q,t)$:\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} q^2 \\left[ 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right) \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( - q^2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nFinally, substituting the definition of the relaxation time $\\tau_R = \\gamma/k$ back into the expression yields the final answer in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{q^2 k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-kt/\\gamma} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis derivation is from first principles, using only the Langevin equation and the statistical properties of the noise, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{q^{2} k_{B} T}{k} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kt}{\\gamma}\\right)\\right)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2907882"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus from confinement by a potential to interaction with a reactive boundary, a ubiquitous scenario in chemical kinetics and cell biology.

It is scientifically grounded in Fick's laws of diffusion and first-order reaction kinetics. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe physical process is governed by the conservation of solute molecules. The continuity equation in the absence of convection is $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, where $c(\\mathbf{r},t)$ is the solute concentration and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the diffusive flux. At steady state, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$, which simplifies the continuity equation to $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the diffusive flux is proportional to the concentration gradient: $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's law into the steady-state continuity equation yields the steady-state diffusion equation, which is Laplace's equation for the concentration field:\n$$ -D \\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) = 0 \\implies \\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) = 0 $$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the problem, the concentration $c$ depends only on the radial distance $r$ from the center of the particle, $c=c(r)$.

The models we use yield symmetric $\\mathbf{M}_{ij}$, so $\\mathbf{M}_{12} = \\mathbf{M}_{21}$. Let $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{R}_2 - \\mathbf{R}_1$ be the separation vector with magnitude $r=|\\mathbf{r}|$ and direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{r}/r$.\n\nIn the far-field limit ($r \\gg a$), the interaction is described by the Oseen tensor, which is the Green's function for the Stokes equations:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}_{12}(r) \\approx \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{8\\pi\\eta r} \\left(\\mathbf{I} + \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo include finite-size effects and ensure the mobility tensor is positive semidefinite for all separations, we employ the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor. For two non-overlapping spheres ($r \\ge 2a$), the off-diagonal mobility tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}_{12}(r) = \\frac{1}{8\\pi\\eta r} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{2a^2}{3r^2}\\right)\\mathbf{I} + \\left(1 - \\frac{2a^2}{r^2}\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\right] \\quad (\\text{for } r \\ge 2a)\n$$\nThis tensor has the required isotropic structure $A(r)\\mathbf{I} + B(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}}$ with two scalar functions $A(r)$ and $B(r)$.\n\nFor overlapping spheres ($r < 2a$), a regularization is required. A standard form that ensures continuity at $r=2a$ and maintains positive definiteness is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}_{12}(r) = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\eta a} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{9r}{32a}\\right)\\mathbf{I} + \\frac{3r}{32a}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\right] \\quad (\\text{for } r < 2a)\n$$\nThese expressions fully define the mobility tensor $\\mathbf{M}$ for the two-sphere system.\n\n**2. The Fluctuation–Dissipation Theorem and The Diffusion Tensor**\n\nThe overdamped Langevin equation for the particle positions $\\mathbf{R}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{R}}{dt} = \\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{R}) \\cdot \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{R}) + \\bm{\\xi}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{R})$ are systematic forces and $\\bm{\\xi}(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise term representing thermal fluctuations. The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) relates the magnitude of these random fluctuations to the dissipative response of the system, embodied by the mobility tensor. Specifically, the noise has zero mean, $\\langle \\bm{\\xi}(t) \\rangle = 0$, and covariance:\n$$\n\\langle \\bm{\\xi}(t) \\bm{\\xi}(t')^{\\mathsf{T}} \\rangle = 2 k_B T \\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{R}(t)) \\delta(t-t')\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe short-time diffusion tensor $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{R})$ is directly proportional to the mobility tensor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{R}) = k_B T \\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{R})\n$$\nThis is the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation generalized for configuration-dependent hydrodynamic interactions.\n\nFor the unforced case ($\\mathbf{F}=0$), the equation of motion for a small time increment $\\Delta t$ is $\\Delta \\mathbf{R} = \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\bm{\\xi}(t') dt'$. The covariance of this displacement is:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{R} \\Delta \\mathbf{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\rangle = \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} \\langle \\bm{\\xi}(t') \\bm{\\xi}(t'')^{\\mathsf{T}} \\rangle dt' dt''\n$$\nAssuming $\\Delta t$ is small enough that $\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{R})$ is constant over the interval, we find:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{R} \\Delta \\mathbf{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\rangle = 2 k_B T \\mathbf{M} \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta t} dt' = 2 k_B T \\mathbf{M} \\Delta t = 2 \\mathbf{D} \\Delta t\n$$\nThis result is derived assuming the Ito convention for the stochastic integral. If the configuration $\\mathbf{R}$ changes, a stochastic drift term proportional to $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D}$ appears in the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, but the covariance of the infinitesimal stochastic step itself remains $2\\mathbf{D}\\Delta t$.\n\n**3. Specific Diffusion Coefficients for N=2 Dimer**\n\nWe specialize to $N=2$ beads with $\\mathbf{R}_1=(0,0,0)$ and $\\mathbf{R}_2=(r,0,0)$, so $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = (1,0,0)$. The off-diagonal diffusion block is $\\mathbf{D}_{12} = k_B T \\mathbf{M}_{12}$. We can express $\\mathbf{D}_{12}$ in terms of its action parallel and perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D}_{12}(r) = D_{12,\\parallel}(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}} + D_{12,\\perp}(r)(\\mathbf{I}-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}})\n$$\nwhere $D_{12,\\parallel}(r)$ and $D_{12,\\perp}(r)$ are scalar diffusion coefficients.\n\nThe problem defines the parallel cross-diffusion as $D_{\\parallel}^{(12)} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{D}_{12} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. Using the decomposed form of $\\mathbf{D}_{12}$, this evaluates to $D_{12,\\parallel}(r)$.\nThe perpendicular cross-diffusion is defined as $D_{\\perp}^{(12)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{P}_\\perp \\mathbf{D}_{12})$ where $\\mathbf{P}_\\perp = \\mathbf{I} - \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. This evaluates to $D_{12,\\perp}(r)$.\nBy comparing the RPY tensor form with the decomposed form, we identify these coefficients.\nFor $r \\ge 2a$:\n$D_{\\parallel}^{(12)}(r) = k_B T \\cdot \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\eta r} \\left(1 - \\frac{2a^2}{3r^2}\\right)$\n$D_{\\perp}^{(12)}(r) = k_B T \\cdot \\frac{1}{8\\pi\\eta r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2a^2}{3r^2}\\right)$\n\nFor $r < 2a$:\n$D_{\\parallel}^{(12)}(r) = \\frac{k_B T}{6\\pi\\eta a} \\left(1 - \\frac{3r}{16a}\\right)$\n$D_{\\perp}^{(12)}(r) = \\frac{k_B T}{6\\pi\\eta a} \\left(1 - \\frac{9r}{32a}\\right)$\n\nFinally, we need $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{D})$, the minimum eigenvalue of the full $6 \\times 6$ diffusion tensor $\\mathbf{D}$. Due to the symmetry of the dimer configuration, $\\mathbf{D}$ is block-diagonal in a basis that separates center-of-mass and relative motion, or alternatively, in a basis aligned with the coordinate axes. The six eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{D}$ are found to be $D_0 \\pm D_{12,\\parallel}(r)$ and $D_0 \\pm D_{12,\\perp}(r)$ (this one doubly degenerate), where $D_0 = k_B T / (6\\pi\\eta a)$ is the single-particle diffusion coefficient.\nA comparison shows that $D_{12,\\parallel}(r) > D_{12,\\perp}(r)$ for all $r>0$. Therefore, the minimum eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{D}) = D_0 - D_{12,\\parallel}(r)\n$$\nThe positive definiteness of the RPY tensor guarantees that this eigenvalue is always positive for $r>0$.\n\nThese formulas are what will be implemented in the program to compute the required values for the specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes parallel and perpendicular cross-diffusion coefficients, and the\n    minimum eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor for a dimer of spherical beads\n    at various separations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the physical constants and bead parameters.\n    K_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    T = 298.0  # Absolute temperature in K\n    ETA = 1.0e-3  # Dynamic viscosity of the fluid in Pa.s\n    A = 0.5e-6  # Bead radius in m\n\n    # Define the test cases as center-to-center separations r.\n    test_cases = [\n        1.5 * A,  # Test 1: r = 1.5a (overlap)\n        2.0 * A,  # Test 2: r = 2.0a (contact)\n        4.0 * A,  # Test 3: r = 4.0a (moderate separation)\n        10.0 * A, # Test 4: r = 10.0a (far separation)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Calculate the single-particle diffusion coefficient (Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland).\n    D0 = K_B * T / (6 * np.pi * ETA * A)\n\n    for r in test_cases:\n        # The calculation depends on whether particles are overlapping.\n        # Implements the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor, including regularization.\n        \n        if r < 2 * A:\n            # For r < 2a, use the regularized form for overlapping spheres.\n            # These formulas are derived from the regularized mobility tensor.\n            d_para_12 = D0 * (1 - 3 * r / (16 * A))\n            d_perp_12 = D0 * (1 - 9 * r / (32 * A))\n        else: # r >= 2a\n            # For r >= 2a, use the standard RPY mobility tensor.\n            kbt_factor = K_B * T\n            \n            # Parallel component of the cross-diffusion tensor\n            # D_parallel = k_B * T * M_parallel\n            # M_parallel = (1 / (4*pi*eta*r)) * (1 - (2*a^2)/(3*r^2))\n            d_para_12 = (kbt_factor / (4 * np.pi * ETA * r)) * (1 - (2 * A**2) / (3 * r**2))\n            \n            # Perpendicular component of the cross-diffusion tensor\n            # D_perp = k_B * T * M_perp\n            # M_perp = (1 / (8*pi*eta*r)) * (1 + (2*a^2)/(3*r^2))\n            d_perp_12 = (kbt_factor / (8 * np.pi * ETA * r)) * (1 + (2 * A**2) / (3 * r**2))\n        \n        # The minimum eigenvalue of the 6x6 diffusion tensor is D0 - D_parallel.\n        lambda_min = D0 - d_para_12\n        \n        # Format results to 8 significant figures in scientific notation.\n        # The format string \"{:.7e}\" ensures 1 digit before and 7 after the decimal.\n        results.append(f\"{d_para_12:.7e}\")\n        results.append(f\"{d_perp_12:.7e}\")\n        results.append(f\"{lambda_min:.7e}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2907910"}]}
