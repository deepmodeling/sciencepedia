The ordinary Stokes-Einstein relation approximately holds for $\\tau \\ll \\tau_c$.**\n-   An elastic plateau ($G'(\\omega) \\approx G_0$, $G''(\\omega) \\approx 0$) would correspond to a time-independent MSD, $\\langle \\Delta r^2(\\tau) \\rangle \\approx$ constant, which contradicts the given $\\tau^{0.75}$ behavior.\n-   The ordinary Stokes-Einstein relation is a long-time result, not a short-time one.\nThis option is multiply flawed. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The regime $\\langle \\Delta r^2(\\tau) \\rangle \\sim \\tau^1$ indicates inertial, ballistic motion at long times, implying $G^*(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^2$ at low frequency. The ordinary Stokes-Einstein relation does not apply at any time.**\n-   The scaling $\\langle \\Delta r^2(\\tau) \\rangle \\sim \\tau^1$ is diffusive motion, not ballistic motion (which is $\\sim \\tau^2$). Ballistic motion would occur at extremely short times, not long times.\n-   This diffusive motion corresponds to $G^*(\\omega) \\sim \\omega$ at low frequencies, not $\\omega^2$.\n-   The ordinary Stokes-Einstein relation does apply, specifically in this long-time diffusive regime.\nThis option contains fundamental errors. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The subdiffusive exponent $0.75$ implies a frequency-dependent viscosity $\\eta^*(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^{-0.25}$ at high frequency, so one should use the ordinary Stokes-Einstein relation with $\\eta(\\omega)$ evaluated at $\\omega \\sim 1/\\tau$ in the short-time regime; it does not hold at long times.**\n-   The scaling $\\eta^*(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^{-0.25}$ is correctly derived from $G^*(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^{0.75}$ since $G^*(\\omega) = i\\omega \\eta^*(\\omega)$. However, the conclusion is flawed.\n-   Describing the use of a frequency-dependent viscosity in the \"ordinary\" Stokes-Einstein relation is a misuse of terminology. That would be a generalized relation.\n-   The claim that the ordinary relation does not hold at long times is the direct opposite of the truth. The long-time, low-frequency limit is precisely where it is defined and holds.\nThis option is conceptually confused. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation from first principles, only option A accurately describes the physical situation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2933894"}]}
