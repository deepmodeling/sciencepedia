Express your final answer as a single simplified analytical expression in terms of $R$, $N$, $b$, and $T$. Do not introduce phenomenological spring constants or fitting parameters.", "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in statistical polymer physics, free of scientific or logical flaws. We will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a freely-jointed polymer chain composed of $N$ rigid links, each of fixed length $b$. The end-to-end vector of the chain, $\\mathbf{R}$, is the vector sum of the individual link vectors, $\\mathbf{r}_i$:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{r}_i $$\nwhere $|\\mathbf{r}_i| = b$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $N$. The links are independently and isotropically oriented. The chain is held such that its end-to-end vector is fixed at $\\mathbf{R}$.\n\nFor a large number of links $N$, the Central Limit Theorem dictates that the probability distribution density for the end-to-end vector, $P(\\mathbf{R})$, will be a Gaussian distribution. This approximation holds in the specified regime of small extension, where the magnitude of the end-to-end vector $R = |\\mathbf{R}|$ is much smaller than the total contour length of the chain, i.e., $R \\ll Nb$.\n\nTo define this Gaussian distribution, we must first compute the mean and variance of $\\mathbf{R}$. Due to the isotropic orientation of each link, the average of any single link vector is the zero vector:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle = \\mathbf{0} $$\nConsequently, the mean of the end-to-end vector is also zero:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{R} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle = \\mathbf{0} $$\nNext, we compute the mean-square end-to-end distance, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle R^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{r}_i \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\mathbf{r}_j \\right) \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j \\rangle $$\nBecause the orientations of different links are independent, the average of the dot product of two different link vectors is zero: $\\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\mathbf{r}_j \\rangle = \\mathbf{0}$ for $i \\neq j$. The cross-terms vanish, and the sum simplifies to:\n$$ \\langle R^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\mathbf{r}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_i \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle |\\mathbf{r}_i|^2 \\rangle $$\nSince each link has a fixed length $b$, we have $\\langle |\\mathbf{r}_i|^2 \\rangle = b^2$. Therefore, the mean-square end-to-end distance is:\n$$ \\langle R^2 \\rangle = N b^2 $$\nBy symmetry in three-dimensional space, the variance is distributed equally among the Cartesian components: $\\langle R_x^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_y^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle R^2 \\rangle = \\frac{Nb^2}{3}$. The probability density for the end-to-end vector $\\mathbf{R}$ is the product of three independent one-dimensional Gaussian distributions:\n$$ P(\\mathbf{R}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\langle R_x^2 \\rangle}} \\right)^3 \\exp\\left( -\\frac{R_x^2 + R_y^2 + R_z^2}{2 \\langle R_x^2 \\rangle} \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N b^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3R^2}{2 N b^2}\\right) $$\nThe number of microscopic configurations, $W(\\mathbf{R})$, corresponding to a macroscopic state defined by $\\mathbf{R}$ is proportional to this probability density, $W(\\mathbf{R}) \\propto P(\\mathbf{R})$. Using the Boltzmann definition of entropy, $S = k_{B} \\ln W$, we find the configurational entropy as a function of $R$:\n$$ S(R) = k_{B} \\ln [C \\cdot P(\\mathbf{R})] = k_{B} \\ln(C) + k_{B} \\ln(P(\\mathbf{R})) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality. Substituting the expression for $P(\\mathbf{R})$:\n$$ S(R) = k_{B} \\ln\\left[C \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2 \\pi N b^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\right] - k_{B}\\frac{3R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nLet $S_0$ be the entropy for $R=0$. The change in entropy due to extension is:\n$$ S(R) = S_0 - \\frac{3 k_{B} R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nThe entropy decreases quadratically as the chain is stretched, reflecting an increase in order.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy is $A = U - TS$. The problem states that there are no conformation-dependent energetic interactions, meaning the internal energy $U$ is independent of $R$. Therefore, any change in free energy upon extension is purely entropic.\n$$ A(R) = U - T S(R) = U - T \\left( S_0 - \\frac{3 k_{B} R^2}{2 N b^2} \\right) = (U-TS_0) + \\frac{3 k_{B} T R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nLetting $A_0 = U-TS_0$ be the free energy of the un-stretched chain, we have:\n$$ A(R) = A_0 + \\frac{3 k_{B} T R^2}{2 N b^2} $$\nThe magnitude of the tensile force, $F$, required to maintain the extension $R$ at a constant temperature $T$ is given by the partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to the extension $R$:\n$$ F = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial R}\\right)_{T} $$\nWe perform the differentiation:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R} \\left( A_0 + \\frac{3 k_{B} T R^2}{2 N b^2} \\right) = \\frac{3 k_{B} T}{2 N b^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}(R^2) = \\frac{3 k_{B} T}{2 N b^2} (2R) $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the entropic force in the Gaussian approximation:\n$$ F = \\frac{3 k_{B} T R}{N b^2} $$\nThis result shows a linear relationship between force and extension, characteristic of a Hookean spring, where the effective spring constant is $\\frac{3 k_{B} T}{N b^2}$.

However, the given potential, $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2}k x^{2}$, is centered at the origin and thus provides a restoring force towards $x=0$, supplementing the polymer's own restoring force. This makes the setup a confinement experiment rather than a pulling experiment. This is a matter of imprecise terminology but does not create a contradiction in the physics or mathematics if we take the explicit formula for $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)$ as the definitive description of the potential. The problem remains solvable and self-consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. We proceed to a full solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe system, comprising the polymer and the microsphere in the trap, is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. The probability density $P(x)$ of finding the microsphere at position $x$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution for the total potential of mean force, which is the total Helmholtz free energy $A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x)$.\n\nThe total free energy is the sum of the polymer's internal free energy, $A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$, and the potential energy of the microsphere in the optical trap, $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)$:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) = A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) + U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)$$\nAccording to the principles of the canonical ensemble, the probability density $P(x)$ is:\n$$P(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$$\nwhere $Z$ is the partition function and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis relation can be inverted to express the total free energy in terms of the probability density:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(x) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. From this, we can isolate the polymer's free energy:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = A_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(x) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) + C$$\nThe entropic force exerted *by the polymer* on the microsphere, $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$, is defined as the negative gradient of the polymer's free energy:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\equiv -\\frac{d A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)}{dx}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln P(x) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) + C \\right)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln P(x) + \\frac{d U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)}{dx}$$\nThis is the general expression connecting the polymer force to the measured probability distribution and the trap potential. The experimental histogram $\\hat{P}(x)$ is used as an estimate for $P(x)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the stated conditions with $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2}k x^{2}$, the polymer’s entropic force can be inferred from the measured histogram via $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\,\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\ln \\hat{P}(x)+k\\,x$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant.**\n\nFor the given potential $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k x^2$, the derivative is $\\frac{d U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x)}{dx} = kx$. Substituting this into our general formula and using $\\hat{P}(x)$ for $P(x)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln \\hat{P}(x) + kx$$\nThis expression matches the statement in option A precisely. The logic is sound and follows directly from first principles.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The polymer’s entropic force can be inferred from the measured histogram without regard to the optical potential as $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\,\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\ln \\hat{P}(x)$.**\n\nThis statement is equivalent to setting the term from the optical trap to zero. Our derivation shows that $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x)$ is recovered from the total energy landscape by subtracting the known contribution from the trap. The measured distribution $\\hat{P}(x)$ is a convolution of the polymer and trap potentials; to deconvolve them, knowledge of the trap potential is essential. The expression in B would only be valid if $k=0$ (no trap), but the problem specifies a trap with stiffness $k$. Therefore, ignoring the trap potential leads to an incorrect inference.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. If instead the measured coordinate is the three-dimensional end-to-end distance $r$ and the trap is spherically symmetric, $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)=\\tfrac{1}{2}k r^{2}$, then the correct inference compensates for configurational degeneracy, giving $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r)=k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\,\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\ln\\!\\big[\\hat{P}(r)/r^{2}\\big]+k\\,r$.**\n\nWe extend the analysis to three dimensions with spherical symmetry. The total free energy depends on the radial distance $r$: $A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) = A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) + U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)$. The probability of finding the bead in a volume element $d^3\\mathbf{r}$ is proportional to $e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} d^3\\mathbf{r}$.\nThe measured histogram $\\hat{P}(r)$ is a radial probability density, meaning $\\hat{P}(r)dr$ is the probability of finding the bead at a distance between $r$ and $r+dr$. This is obtained by integrating over a spherical shell of volume $4\\pi r^2 dr$.\n$$P(r)dr \\propto e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} (4\\pi r^2 dr)$$\n$$P(r) \\propto r^2 e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$$\nThe term $r^2$ is a geometric (Jacobian) factor reflecting the increasing volume of phase space available at larger radii.\nInverting for $A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r)$:\n$$e^{-A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} \\propto \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\implies A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\right) + C'$$\nThe polymer free energy is $A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = A_{\\mathrm{total}}(r) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)$.\nThe radial force is $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = -\\frac{d A_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r)}{dr}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = -\\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ -k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\right) - U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r) \\right]$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dr} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(r)}{r^2} \\right) + \\frac{d U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r)}{dr}$$\nUsing $U_{\\mathrm{trap}}(r) = \\frac{1}{2}kr^2$, its derivative is $\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{trap}}}{dr}=kr$. Replacing $P(r)$ with $\\hat{P}(r)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(r) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dr} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\hat{P}(r)}{r^2} \\right) + kr$$\nThis expression correctly compensates for the configurational degeneracy via the $1/r^2$ term and matches the statement.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For finite trap stiffness, it is sufficient to replace $x$ by its time average $\\langle x\\rangle$ and drop the derivative term, so that $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\langle x\\rangle)=k\\,\\langle x\\rangle$ holds generally for equilibrium data.**\n\nLet us take the average of the correct expression from option A:\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = \\left\\langle kx + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln P(x) \\right\\rangle$$\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = \\int \\left( kx + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\frac{P'(x)}{P(x)} \\right) P(x) dx$$\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = k \\int x P(x) dx + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\int P'(x) dx$$\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = k \\langle x \\rangle + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T [P(x)]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}$$\nSince $P(x)$ must vanish at the boundaries of the accessible region, the boundary term is zero. Thus, we have the exact relation for the average forces:\n$$\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle = k \\langle x \\rangle$$\nHowever, option D states $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\langle x\\rangle) = k \\langle x \\rangle$. This replaces the average of the function, $\\langle F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(x) \\rangle$, with the function of the average, $F_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\langle x\\rangle)$. For any non-linear function $f(x)$, it is generally true that $\\langle f(x) \\rangle \\neq f(\\langle x \\rangle)$ due to fluctuations. Polymer force-extension relations are fundamentally non-linear. The approximation is only valid in the limit of an infinitely stiff trap ($k \\to \\infty$), where fluctuations vanish ($\\sigma_x \\to 0$) and $\\langle x \\rangle \\to x$. The problem specifies a finite trap stiffness. Thus, the statement is a physically incorrect simplification.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2914556"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores a more subtle and fascinating origin of entropic forces: topology.

All necessary information and definitions are provided to establish a relationship between the system's configurational entropy and the variable $\\ell$. The definition of entropic force is standard. No essential data is missing, and the constraints are consistent. The mention of the Kuhn length $b$ which does not appear in the final scaling laws is not a contradiction; it is a fundamental parameter that would be absorbed into the proportionality constants of the scaling relations, which are irrelevant for the final force calculation due to the derivative operation.\n\nThe problem is objective and free of ambiguity.

For an ideal (phantom) chain, the internal energy $U$ is independent of the chain's conformation. Therefore, changes in free energy are driven solely by changes in entropy: $dF = -TdS$.

The part of the free energy that depends on $\\ell$ is:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{dep}}(\\ell) = -k_B T \\left( -a_k \\ln(\\ell) - \\frac{3}{2} \\ln(L-\\ell) \\right) = k_B T \\left( a_k \\ln(\\ell) + \\frac{3}{2} \\ln(L-\\ell) \\right)\n$$\nThe generalized entropic force $f_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell)$ is defined as the negative partial derivative of the free energy with respect to $\\ell$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell) = -\\frac{\\partial F(\\ell)}{\\partial \\ell} = -\\frac{\\partial F_{\\mathrm{dep}}(\\ell)}{\\partial \\ell}\n$$\nWe now compute the derivative:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ell} \\left[ k_B T \\left( a_k \\ln(\\ell) + \\frac{3}{2} \\ln(L-\\ell) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $k_B$ and $T$ are constants with respect to $\\ell$, we can pull them out of the derivative:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell) = -k_B T \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ell}(a_k \\ln(\\ell)) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ell}\\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\ln(L-\\ell)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ell}(a_k \\ln(\\ell)) = \\frac{a_k}{\\ell}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ell}\\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\ln(L-\\ell)\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{L-\\ell} \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{3}{2(L-\\ell)}\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for the force:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell) = -k_B T \\left( \\frac{a_k}{\\ell} - \\frac{3}{2(L-\\ell)} \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the negative sign yields the final expression for the entropic force:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell) = k_B T \\left( \\frac{3}{2(L-\\ell)} - \\frac{a_k}{\\ell} \\right)\n$$\nThis force represents the statistical tendency for the system to change $\\ell$ in order to maximize its total number of configurations (entropy). A positive force tends to increase $\\ell$, while a negative force tends to decrease it. The term $-\\frac{k_B T a_k}{\\ell}$ is a compressive force seeking to minimize the length of the entropically costly knotted section. The term $+\\frac{3 k_B T}{2(L-\\ell)}$ is an expansive force seeking to minimize the length of the unknotted section, which is equivalent to maximizing the length of the knotted section. The balance between these two opposing entropic effects determines the net force and the equilibrium state where $f_{\\mathrm{ent}}(\\ell)=0$.\nThe units of $k_B T$ are energy (Joules), and the units of the term in parentheses are inverse length (meters$^{-1}$), so the final expression has units of force (Joules/meter), as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_B T \\left( \\frac{3}{2(L-\\ell)} - \\frac{a_k}{\\ell} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2914555"}]}
