It is based on the standard Frank-Oseen continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals, a fundamental framework in soft matter physics. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided to derive a scaling estimate for the elastic energies. The problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe elastic free energy density, $f_{el}$, of an achiral nematic liquid crystal is given by the Frank-Oseen expression, which includes terms quadratic in the spatial gradients of the director field $\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$f_{el} = \\frac{1}{2} K_{1} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} K_{2} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n}))^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} K_{3} (\\mathbf{n} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n}))^{2}$$\nHere, $K_{1}$, $K_{2}$, and $K_{3}$ are the elastic constants for splay, twist, and bend deformations, respectively. The director $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector, $|\\mathbf{n}|=1$. The problem specifies that the geometric configurations are chosen to isolate each of these three modes. The total elastic free energy, $F_{el}$, is obtained by integrating the energy density over the volume $V$ of the material:\n$$F_{el} = \\int_{V} f_{el} \\, dV$$\nThe problem describes a slab of cross-sectional area $A$ and a one-dimensional director variation over a length $L$. Thus, the volume is $V = A L$. As the variation is uniform over the cross-section, the total energy can be estimated by multiplying the characteristic energy density by the volume: $F_{el} \\approx f_{el} \\cdot (A L)$.\n\nThe core of the problem is a scaling argument. A distortion of the director field by a small angle $\\theta$ (in radians) over a characteristic length scale $L$ implies that the spatial derivatives of the director components, i.e., terms like $\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial x_j}$, will be of the order of magnitude of $\\frac{\\theta}{L}$. We will use this scaling to estimate the energy for each mode.\n\n1.  **Splay Deformation**\n    The splay energy is controlled by the $K_{1}$ term, involving $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. To isolate this mode, we consider a configuration where the director \"splays\" out. Let the director be predominantly along the $x$-axis, with its orientation varying along the $y$-axis. A suitable director field for small angles $\\theta$ over a length $L$ can be approximated as $\\mathbf{n}(y) \\approx (1, \\frac{\\theta}{L}y, 0)$ for $y \\in [0, L]$.\n    The divergence of the director field is:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\partial n_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial n_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial n_z}{\\partial z} \\approx 0 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{L}y\\right) + 0 = \\frac{\\theta}{L}$$\n    The curl is $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n} \\approx \\mathbf{0}$, so the twist and bend terms vanish. The splay energy density is therefore:\n    $$f_{splay} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} K_{1} \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{L}\\right)^{2}$$\n    The total splay energy, $F_{splay}$, integrated over the volume $V=AL$, is:\n    $$F_{splay} \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{2} K_{1} \\frac{\\theta^{2}}{L^{2}} \\right) (A L) = \\frac{1}{2} K_{1} \\frac{A \\theta^{2}}{L}$$\n\n2.  **Twist Deformation**\n    The twist energy is controlled by the $K_{2}$ term, involving the pseudoscalar quantity $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n})$. A pure twist is created when the director rotates in a plane perpendicular to the direction of spatial variation. Let the variation be along the $z$-axis. The director can be described as $\\mathbf{n}(z) = (\\cos(\\phi(z)), \\sin(\\phi(z)), 0)$. For a total rotation of $\\theta$ over length $L$, we have $\\phi(z) = \\frac{\\theta}{L}z$.\n    We compute the necessary quantities:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0$$\n    $$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n} = \\hat{x}(-\\frac{\\partial n_y}{\\partial z}) + \\hat{y}(\\frac{\\partial n_x}{\\partial z}) = \\hat{x}\\left(-\\frac{\\theta}{L}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta z}{L}\\right)\\right) + \\hat{y}\\left(-\\frac{\\theta}{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta z}{L}\\right)\\right)$$\n    The twist term is:\n    $$\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n}) = n_x (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n})_x + n_y (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n})_y = -\\frac{\\theta}{L}\\cos^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\theta z}{L}\\right) - \\frac{\\theta}{L}\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\theta z}{L}\\right) = -\\frac{\\theta}{L}$$\n    The bend term $\\mathbf{n} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n})$ is zero for this configuration. Thus, the twist energy density is:\n    $$f_{twist} = \\frac{1}{2} K_{2} \\left(-\\frac{\\theta}{L}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} K_{2} \\frac{\\theta^{2}}{L^{2}}$$\n    The total twist energy, $F_{twist}$, is:\n    $$F_{twist} \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{2} K_{2} \\frac{\\theta^{2}}{L^{2}} \\right) (A L) = \\frac{1}{2} K_{2} \\frac{A \\theta^{2}}{L}$$\n\n3.  **Bend Deformation**\n    The bend energy is controlled by the $K_{3}$ term, involving the vector $\\mathbf{n} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n})$. Bend occurs when the director changes direction while remaining in a plane that contains the direction of variation. Let the variation be along the $z$-axis, and the director lie in the $xz$-plane. For a small angular deviation, we can write $\\mathbf{n}(z) \\approx (\\frac{\\theta}{L}z, 0, 1)$.\n    We calculate the derivatives:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\approx 0$$\n    The curl is:\n    $$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n} \\approx \\hat{y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial n_x}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\hat{y}\\frac{\\theta}{L}$$\n    Therefore, the twist term $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{n}) \\approx 0$.
