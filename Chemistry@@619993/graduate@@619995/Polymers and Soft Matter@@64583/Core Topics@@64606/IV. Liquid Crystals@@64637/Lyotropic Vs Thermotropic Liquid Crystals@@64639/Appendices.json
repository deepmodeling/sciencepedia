Before providing the solution for the specific systems, we will first deduce the general expression for the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom, $F$, as required.\n\nLet a system be composed of $C$ independent chemical components and exist in $P$ coexisting phases at thermodynamic equilibrium. The state of this multiphase, multicomponent system is described by a set of intensive variables. The number of degrees of freedom, $F$, is the number of these intensive variables that can be varied independently without altering the number of phases in equilibrium.\n\nThe intensive variables that define the system are temperature $T$, pressure $p$, and the compositions of each phase. For each phase $j$ (where $j$ ranges from $1$ to $P$), the composition is specified by the mole fractions $x_{ij}$ of each component $i$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $C$).\n\nThe total number of intensive variables available to describe the system is therefore the sum of the temperature, the pressure, and all the mole fractions in all phases. This gives a total of $2 + C \\times P$ variables.\n\nHowever, these variables are not all independent. They are subject to two types of constraints imposed by the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium:\n\n1.  **Compositional Constraints:** Within each phase $j$, the sum of the mole fractions of all components must equal unity.\n    $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_{ij} = 1 \\quad (\\text{for each phase } j = 1, \\dots, P) $$\n    This provides $P$ independent equations, one for each phase.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constraints:** For the system to be in equilibrium, the temperature and pressure must be uniform throughout all phases.

The derivation hinges on writing a mass balance, or more conveniently a volume balance, for one of the components.

Let $V_{\\mathrm{I}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{N}}$ be the volumes of the isotropic and nematic phases, respectively.

Let $V_{\\mathrm{rod, tot}}$ be the total volume of rods in the entire sample. Let $V_{\\mathrm{rod, I}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{rod, N}}$ be the volume of rods within the isotropic and nematic phases, respectively. The conservation of rod volume dictates:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rod, tot}} = V_{\\mathrm{rod, I}} + V_{\\mathrm{rod, N}}$$\nThe volume fraction of rods in any given region is the volume of rods in that region divided by the total volume of that region.
