The exponent $n$ is what must be found.\n\nThe extended volume fraction $X_{e}(t)$ represents the sum of the volumes of all crystalline entities if they were allowed to grow without impinging upon one another. It is calculated by integrating the contributions from all nuclei formed up to time $t$. Let $\\dot{N}(t')$ be the nucleation rate density (number of nuclei formed per unit volume per unit time) at time $t'$. The contribution to $X_{e}(t)$ from nuclei formed in the interval $[t', t' + dt']$ is the number of such nuclei, $\\dot{N}(t') dt'$, multiplied by their volume at time $t$, $V_d(t, t')$. Thus, the general expression for the extended volume is:\n$$X_{e}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{N}(t') V_d(t, t') dt'$$\nThe growing objects are $d$-dimensional balls (hyperspheres) with a radius $R(t, t')$ that grows linearly with time: $R(t, t') = G(t - t')$ for a constant growth rate $G$. The volume of a $d$-ball of radius $R$ is given by $V_d(R) = C_d R^d$, where $C_d$ is a geometric factor equal to the volume of a unit $d$-ball. Specifically, $C_d = \\frac{\\pi^{d/2}}{\\Gamma(d/2 + 1)}$, where $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.

It is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Evaluation\n\nWe proceed to derive the correct methodology from first principles and evaluate the given options against it.\n\nThe Avrami equation describes the time evolution of the volume fraction of transformed material, $X(t)$, during an isothermal phase change:\n$$X(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left[-K(t-t_0)^n\\right]$$\nHere, $K$ is the overall kinetic constant, which depends on nucleation and growth rates; $n$ is the Avrami exponent, which reflects the mechanism of nucleation and the dimensionality of growth; and $t_0$ is the induction time, which is the period before the onset of stable crystal growth.\n\nTo determine $n$ and $K$ from experimental data, this equation is linearized. Rearranging the equation yields:\n$$-\\ln(1 - X(t)) = K(t-t_0)^n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the linear form:\n$$\\ln\\left[-\\ln(1 - X(t))\\right] = n \\ln(t - t_0) + \\ln(K)$$\nThis is the equation of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where the dependent variable is $y_i = \\ln\\left[-\\ln(1 - X(t_i))\\right]$, the independent variable is $x_i = \\ln(t_i - t_0)$, the slope is $m = n$, and the y-intercept is $c = \\ln(K)$. A plot of $y$ versus $x$ is known as the Avrami plot.\n\nNow, we evaluate the necessary steps to construct this plot and perform the fit correctly.\n\n1.  **Calculation of $X(t)$**: Premise (i) correctly states that $X(t)$ is determined from the heat released. The instantaneous heat flow rate, $\\frac{dQ}{dt}$, is proportional to the rate of crystallization, $\\frac{dX}{dt}$. The total heat released upon completion, $\\Delta H_c$, corresponds to $X=1$. Therefore, the fraction transformed at time $t$ is the ratio of the cumulative heat released up to time $t$, $Q(t)$, to the total heat of crystallization, $\\Delta H_c$.\n    $$X(t) = \\frac{Q(t)}{\\Delta H_c} = \\frac{\\int_{t_0}^{t} \\left(\\frac{dQ}{d\\tau}\\right) d\\tau}{\\int_{t_0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{dQ}{d\\tau}\\right) d\\tau}$$\n    The integrals must be performed on the baseline-subtracted heat flow data.\n\n2.  **Time Origin**: The physical process modeled by Avrami kinetics begins after an induction period $t_0$. Using laboratory time $t$ instead of the effective crystallization time $t_{eff} = t - t_0$ is a physical error that introduces curvature into the Avrami plot, especially at early times, and leads to incorrect estimates of $n$ and $K$. The value of $t_0$ must be identified from the data, typically as the time where the heat flow signal begins to deviate from the baseline.\n\n3.  **Range of Fit**: The simple Avrami model assumes ideal conditions (e.g., homogeneous nucleation, constant growth rate) that are only met during the primary stage of crystallization. The model fails at very early times ($X \\to 0$), where nucleation is stochastic, and at late times ($X \\to 1$), where spherulite impingement is complete and slower secondary crystallization or crystal perfection processes begin. Therefore, a linear regression must be performed only on an intermediate range of transformation, for example, over $X \\in [0.1, 0.7]$.\n\n4.  **Statistical Weighting**: Premise (iii) states the noise in the heat flow measurement, $\\sigma_{dQ/dt}$, is stationary (constant). The variable being fitted, $y(t) = \\ln[-\\ln(1 - X(t))]$, is a highly nonlinear transformation of the integrated heat flow. The propagation of error from the raw signal to $y(t)$ will result in a non-constant variance, $\\sigma_y^2(t)$. A statistically robust fitting procedure, such as Weighted Least Squares (WLS), is required to obtain unbiased and efficient estimates. In WLS, each data point $(x_i, y_i)$ is assigned a weight $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{y_i}^2$. An unweighted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) fit is statistically inappropriate as it implicitly assumes constant error variance for $y(t)$, which is here a false assumption.\n\nWith these principles established, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A**: This option is flawed in every aspect.\n- It proposes using heat flow rate as a proxy for the extent of transformation $X(t)$. This is physically incorrect; the rate of heat flow $\\frac{dQ}{dt}$ is proportional to the rate of transformation $\\frac{dX}{dt}$, not the extent $X(t)$.\n- It ignores the induction time $t_0$.\n- It proposes fitting over the entire data range, which is known to be incorrect due to deviations from the Avrami model at early and late stages.\n- It proposes Ordinary Least Squares, which is statistically non-rigorous for this problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option B**: This option correctly specifies all critical steps.\n- It correctly defines $X(t)$ via numerical integration of the heat flow and normalization by the total enthalpy $\\Delta H_c$. This is physically consistent with premise (i).\n- It correctly identifies the necessity of determining an induction time $t_0$ and using the effective time $t_{eff} = t - t_0$.\n- It correctly restricts the linear fit to an intermediate window of $X(t)$, thereby isolating the primary crystallization process for which the Avrami model is valid.\n- It correctly prescribes the use of a weighted linear regression with weights derived from the propagation of measurement noise, which is the most statistically principled approach given the non-linear transformations involved.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C**: This option contains multiple errors.\n- Normalizing by the peak height of the exotherm has no physical basis for defining the extent of transformation $X(t)$, which must span from $0$ to $1$. Total area ($\\Delta H_c$) is the correct normalization factor.\n- It incorrectly advises against adjusting the time origin.\n- The proposed weighting scheme, proportional to the square of the heat flow, is ad hoc and not derived from a principled error propagation analysis.\n- It incorrectly includes late-time data beyond the primary crystallization exotherm.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D**: This option is irrelevant to the problem.\n- It describes an analysis procedure for *non-isothermal* DSC experiments (e.g., Kissinger or Ozawa methods), not the *isothermal* experiment specified in the problem statement.\n- The proposed weighting scheme is, again, ad hoc.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E**: This option describes a simplified, approximate method.\n- The approximation $\\ln(X) \\approx n \\ln(t) + \\ln(K)$ is valid only for very small values of $X(t)$. Using only this early-time regime discards the majority of the data where the signal-to-noise ratio is highest, making the fit statistically inefficient and sensitive to the precise determination of $t_0$.\n- It fails to explicitly mention the correction for induction time, referring only to \"time $t$\".\n- It proposes an unweighted least squares fit, which is statistically suboptimal. While this approach can provide a quick estimate, it is not the \"most robust and scientifically sound procedure\" as demanded by the question.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, Option B is the only procedure that satisfies all the requirements of physical consistency, correct methodological implementation of the Avrami analysis, and statistical rigor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2924293"}, {"introduction": "In real-world experiments, crystallization kinetics can be more complex than the ideal Avrami model suggests, often resulting in tell-tale signs like curved Avrami plots.

The phenomena described—curved Avrami plots, time-dependent nucleation or growth rates, and the effect of self-heating—are standard and important topics in polymer physics. We may therefore proceed to a solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship in JMAK theory is between the transformed volume fraction $X(t)$ and the extended volume fraction $V_{ext}(t)$:\n$$X(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left[-V_{ext}(t)\\right]$$\nRearranging and taking logarithms yields the basis for the Avrami plot:\n$$\\ln\\left\\{-\\ln\\left[1 - X(t)\\right]\\right\\} = \\ln\\left[V_{ext}(t)\\right]$$\nA linear plot of this quantity against $\\ln t$ implies a power-law relationship $V_{ext}(t) = K t^n$, where $n$ is the Avrami exponent. The problem states this plot is curved, indicating that $V_{ext}(t)$ does not follow a simple power law. This deviation from ideal behavior arises because the underlying assumptions of the simple model—typically a constant nucleation rate $I$ and a constant linear growth rate $G$—are violated.\n\nThe general expression for the extended volume for three-dimensional spherical growth is an integral over the history of nucleation and growth:\n$$V_{ext}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} I(\\tau) \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left[R(t, \\tau)\\right]^3 \\right) d\\tau$$\nwhere $I(\\tau)$ is the nucleation rate per unit volume at time $\\tau$, and $R(t, \\tau)$ is the radius at time $t$ of a spherulite nucleated at time $\\tau$. The radius is given by the integral of the growth rate $G(s)$:\n$$R(t, \\tau) = \\int_{\\tau}^{t} G(s) \\, ds$$\nThe total number density of spherulites at time $t$ is the integral of the nucleation rate:\n$$N(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} I(\\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\nThe problem is to devise experiments that can distinguish between two primary causes for the curved Avrami plot:\n1.  **Time-dependent nucleation**: $I(t)$ is not constant, but $G(t)$ is a constant, $G_0$. In this case, $N(t)$ will be an increasing function of time, while direct measurement of any given spherulite's radius will show it to increase linearly with time ($dR/dt = G_0$).\n2.  **Decaying growth rate**: $G(t)$ is a decreasing function of time, while nucleation is effectively instantaneous (site-saturated, $I(t) = N_0 \\delta(t)$) or completes very early in the process. In this case, the spherulite number density $N(t)$ will quickly plateau to a constant value $N_0$, but the radius of each spherulite will grow sub-linearly with time ($dR/dt = G(t)$ is a decaying function).\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed criterion.\n\n**A. Directly measure the spherulite number density $N(t)$ by Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) and, on the same sample, independently track $R(t;\\tau)$ for multiple spherulites to extract $G(t) = dR/dt$. If $N(t)$ keeps increasing while $G(t)$ remains approximately constant, assign the curvature to time-dependent nucleation; if $N(t)$ plateaus early while $G(t)$ decays with time, assign it to growth-rate decay.**\n\nThis option proposes a direct deconvolution of the nucleation and growth contributions by measuring their defining quantities, $N(t)$ and $G(t)$, separately but simultaneously. Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) is the standard and appropriate technique for observing spherulites, counting them to determine $N(t)$, and tracking their radii over time to determine $G(t)$.\n- If POM reveals that the number of spherulites, $N(t)$, continually increases throughout a significant portion of the crystallization process while the radii of individual spherulites grow at a constant rate ($G(t) \\approx \\text{constant}$), this is a direct observation of time-dependent (protracted) nucleation with constant growth. This matches the first scenario described above.\n- If POM shows that the number of spherulites, $N(t)$, becomes constant very early in the transformation (site saturation), while the growth rate of these spherulites, $G(t)$, demonstrably decreases over time, this is a a direct observation of growth-rate decay under site-saturated conditions. This matches the second scenario.\nThis method is based on the fundamental definitions of the quantities involved and provides an unambiguous distinction.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Read off only the instantaneous slope of $\\ln\\big[-\\ln\\big(1 - X(t)\\big)\\big]$ at $X(t) \\approx 0.5$; if the slope is less than $2$, conclude that growth-rate decay is the origin, whereas if it exceeds $2$, conclude time-dependent nucleation.**\n\nThis method proposes using a single value, the local Avrami exponent $n(t) = d(\\ln V_{ext})/d(\\ln t)$ at one point in the transformation ($X \\approx 0.5$), to diagnose the kinetic mechanism. While a decaying growth rate often leads to a decrease in the effective Avrami exponent, and protracted nucleation can shift it, the use of a sharp, arbitrary threshold of $n = 2$ is not mechanistically robust. For example, for three-dimensional growth ($d=3$), instantaneous nucleation yields $n=3$ and sporadic nucleation yields $n=4$. If growth-rate decay is superimposed on the $n=3$ case, the local exponent might fall to, for example, $n(t)=2.5$. This is greater than $2$, yet growth-rate decay is present. Conversely, for two-dimensional growth ($d=2$), sporadic nucleation gives $n=3$. A superimposed decay in nucleation rate could cause the local exponent to fall below $3$, possibly even below $2$ at $X=0.5$, which would be misidentified as growth-rate decay under this criterion. The local exponent is a convoluted function of both nucleation and growth; a single value from this convoluted output cannot reliably separate the inputs. This is an empirical \"rule of thumb\" at best, not a first-principles diagnostic.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Perform a double-stage experiment: first create a site-saturated distribution of nuclei by a brief hold at a temperature chosen to maximize nucleation while minimizing growth, then jump to the target isothermal temperature and record $X(t)$ and $\\ln\\big[-\\ln\\big(1 - X(t)\\big)\\big]$ versus $\\ln t$. If the curvature largely disappears under site-saturated conditions, conclude that time-dependent nucleation caused the original curvature; if it persists, conclude that growth-rate decay is responsible.**\n\nThis is a powerful experimental design based on the principle of controlled intervention. It aims to experimentally fix the nucleation condition to be \"site-saturated\" (i.e., instantaneous) and then observe the resulting kinetics.\n- The pre-nucleation step at a temperature $T_{nucl}$ (where nucleation rate is maximal) creates a large density of nuclei, $N_0$, before significant growth occurs.\n- The subsequent temperature jump to the crystallization temperature $T_c$ allows these nuclei to grow.\n- If the original curvature at $T_c$ was due to time-dependent nucleation ($I(t)$ was not a delta function), this new protocol forces $I(t)$ to approximate $N_0 \\delta(t)$. If $G(t)$ is constant at $T_c$, the kinetics will now follow the ideal Avrami model for instantaneous nucleation, and the Avrami plot should become a straight line. The disappearance of curvature confirms that time-dependent nucleation was the original cause.\n- If the original curvature was due to a decaying growth rate $G(t)$ at $T_c$, this underlying cause is unaffected by the change in nucleation protocol. The growth will still be non-linear in time, and the Avrami plot measured in the second step will remain curved. Persistence of curvature thus points to growth-rate decay as the responsible mechanism.\nThis method correctly isolates the variable of interest.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Determine the asymptotic crystallinity $X_{\\infty}$ from long-time calorimetry; if $X_{\\infty} < 0.5$ the curvature must be due to growth-rate decay, whereas $X_{\\infty} \\ge 0.5$ indicates time-dependent nucleation.**\n\nThis proposition is mechanistically flawed. The final, or ultimate, degree of crystallinity, $X_{\\infty}$, is primarily determined by factors intrinsic to the polymer's molecular architecture and the thermodynamic state of the uncrystallized portion. These factors include chain regularity, presence of defects or branches, entanglements, and the vitrification of the remaining amorphous phase, which freezes chain mobility and halts crystallization. A polymer might have a low intrinsic $X_{\\infty}$ (e.g., $X_{\\infty} = 0.4$) irrespective of whether the kinetic pathway to that state involved time-dependent nucleation or growth-rate decay. Similarly, a highly regular polymer might achieve a high $X_{\\infty}$ (e.g., $X_{\\infty} = 0.8$) under either kinetic scenario. There is no fundamental principle linking the value of $X_{\\infty}$ to the specific cause of non-ideal Avrami kinetics.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Vary the sample thickness over at least a factor of $2$ to modulate self-heating and transport, and simultaneously measure $G(t)$ by POM or time-resolved Small-Angle Light Scattering (SALS). If curvature weakens in thinner samples where $G(t)$ is closer to constant, attribute the original curvature to growth-rate decay; if curvature and $N(t)$ evolution are thickness-invariant within experimental uncertainty, attribute it to time-dependent nucleation.**\n\nThis option tests a specific and common physical mechanism for growth-rate decay: self-heating. Crystallization is exothermic, and the released heat can raise the sample temperature. This temperature rise can in turn reduce the crystallization driving force (supercooling), causing $G(t)$ to decrease over time. The magnitude of this self-heating effect is dependent on the balance between heat generation (proportional to volume) and heat dissipation (proportional to surface area). Thinner samples have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio and thus dissipate heat more effectively, minimizing the temperature rise.\n- If growth-rate decay due to self-heating is the cause of curvature, reducing the sample thickness will suppress this effect. The growth rate $G(t)$ should become more constant, and as a result, the Avrami plot should become less curved (straighter). Observing this correlation is strong evidence for growth-rate decay being the origin.\n- Nucleation rate is an intrinsic function of temperature and is not expected to depend on sample geometry (thickness), provided the sample is statistically representative. If the curvature is caused by time-dependent nucleation, changing the sample thickness should have a negligible effect on the kinetics. Observing that the curvature and the measured $N(t)$ evolution are invariant with thickness would therefore point to time-dependent nucleation as the cause.\nThis is another sound experimental design based on controlled intervention.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2924248"}]}
