The givens are complete and consistent. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe excluded-volume parameter, denoted by $v$, quantifies the effective volume excluded to one monomer by the presence of another. In the context of dilute solutions, this parameter is directly related to the second virial coefficient, $B_{2}$, of the monomer gas. The fundamental connection is rooted in statistical mechanics, where $v$ is defined by an integral over the pair potential $U(r)$ between two monomers. The pair potential $U(r)$ is a function of the center-to-center distance $r$ between the monomers. The expression for $v$ is given by:\n$$v = \\int \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(r)}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\right) d^{3}\\mathbf{r}$$\nHere, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The term $\\exp(-U(r)/(k_{B}T))$ is related to the pair correlation function at low density, and the integral is taken over all space. The quantity $f(r) = \\exp(-U(r)/(k_{B}T)) - 1$ is known as the Mayer f-function, and the excluded volume is related to it by $v = - \\int f(r) d^{3}\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nThe problem models monomers as impenetrable hard spheres of diameter $a$. The pair potential $U(r)$ for this model is specified as:\n$$U(r) = \\begin{cases} \\infty & \\text{for } r < a \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } r \\ge a \\end{cases}$$\nThis potential reflects the physical reality that two hard spheres of diameter $a$ cannot have their centers closer than a distance $a$ without overlapping. For any center-to-center distance $r \\ge a$, there is no interaction.\n\nWe must now substitute this specific potential into the integral for $v$. The integrand, $1 - \\exp(-U(r)/(k_{B}T))$, must be evaluated piecewise for the two regions defined by the potential.\n\nFor the region where $r < a$, the potential is $U(r) = \\infty$. The exponential term becomes:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\infty}{k_{B}T}\\right) = 0$$\nThus, for $r < a$, the integrand is $1 - 0 = 1$.\n\nFor the region where $r \\ge a$, the potential is $U(r) = 0$. The exponential term becomes:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nThus, for $r \\ge a$, the integrand is $1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nThe integral for $v$ therefore simplifies significantly. The integrand is non-zero only within the sphere of radius $a$ centered at the origin.\n$$v = \\int_{r<a} 1 \\cdot d^{3}\\mathbf{r} + \\int_{r\\ge a} 0 \\cdot d^{3}\\mathbf{r}$$\nThe second integral is zero. The first integral is simply the volume of a sphere of radius $a$.\n$$v = \\int_{r<a} d^{3}\\mathbf{r} = \\text{Volume of a sphere of radius } a$$\nTo compute this volume, we perform the integration in spherical coordinates, where the volume element is $d^{3}\\mathbf{r} = 4\\pi r^{2} dr$.\n$$v = \\int_{0}^{a} 4\\pi r^{2} dr$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$v = 4\\pi \\left[ \\frac{r^{3}}{3} \\right]_{0}^{a} = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{a^{3}}{3} - 0 \\right)$$\n$$v = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^{3}$$\n\nThis is the analytic expression for the excluded-volume parameter for the hard-sphere monomer model.\n\nWe now address the remaining parts of the problem.\nFirst, on the dependence of $v$ on $a$ and $T$. Our result, $v = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^{3}$, clearly depends on the monomer diameter $a$ but is independent of the absolute temperature $T$. This is a characteristic feature of athermal interactions, such as the hard-sphere potential, where the energy scale is either zero or infinite. The Boltzmann factor becomes a simple step function ($0$ or $1$), eliminating any dependence on $T$.\n\nSecond, on the sign of $v$ in a good solvent. A good solvent is one where monomer-solvent interactions are more favorable than monomer-monomer interactions, leading to an effective repulsion between monomers. This repulsion causes the polymer chain to swell to maximize its contact with the solvent. The excluded-volume parameter $v$ is the measure of this net interaction. A positive value, $v > 0$, signifies repulsion and corresponds to a good solvent. A negative value would imply attraction and a poor solvent, leading to chain collapse. Our derived result, $v = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^{3}$, is manifestly positive since the diameter $a$ must be a positive physical quantity. This positive sign is consistent with the purely repulsive nature of the hard-sphere potential, which represents the idealized limit of a good solvent. The derived value represents the volume around one monomer's center that is inaccessible to the center of any other monomer, which is precisely the volume of a sphere of radius $a$, the minimum possible center-to-center distance.\n\nThe final expression for $v$ is requested in terms of $a$ only, which we have found. Assuming $a$ is given in SI units (meters), the resulting $v$ is in cubic meters, as is appropriate for a volume.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3} \\pi a^{3}}$$", "id": "2915203"}, {"introduction": "While the hard-sphere model captures pure repulsion, real-world interactions involve both short-range repulsion and longer-range attraction.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, and therefore is deemed valid.\n\nThe Flory theory approximates the total Helmholtz free energy, $F(R)$, of a polymer coil of size $R$ as the sum of two competing contributions: an entropic elastic term, $F_{el}(R)$, and a monomer-monomer interaction term, $F_{int}(R)$.\n$$F(R) = F_{el}(R) + F_{int}(R)$$\n\nFirst, we establish the form of the elastic free energy, $F_{el}(R)$. This term quantifies the entropic cost of deforming the polymer chain from its ideal, unperturbed dimensions. For an ideal Gaussian chain consisting of $N$ Kuhn segments of length $a$, the mean-square end-to-end distance is $\\langle R_0^2 \\rangle = N a^2$. The free energy associated with stretching the chain to a size $R$ is predominantly entropic and, for a Gaussian chain model, is quadratic in the deformation. It can be expressed as:\n$$F_{el}(R) = C_{el} k_B T \\frac{R^2}{N a^2}$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $C_{el}$ is a numerical constant of order unity (often taken as $3/2$). This term represents an energetic penalty for expanding the coil ($R > R_0$) and acts as an effective spring, providing a restoring force that favors a more compact conformation.\n\nSecond, we determine the interaction free energy, $F_{int}(R)$. This term accounts for the repulsive interactions between monomers in a good solvent, which cause the chain to swell. The problem specifies a description at the level of the second virial approximation. The interaction energy density in a system of particles at concentration $\\rho$ is proportional to $v \\rho^2$, where $v$ is the second virial coefficient, or the excluded volume parameter. We assume the polymer coil is a sphere of radius $R$ containing $N$ monomers distributed with a uniform concentration:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{N}{V} \\sim \\frac{N}{R^3}$$\nwhere we have approximated the volume $V$ of the coil as being proportional to $R^3$.
