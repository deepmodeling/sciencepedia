The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, resting on foundational principles of polymer physics. We shall proceed by following the three specified steps.\n\nStep 1: Dimensional Analysis\n\nWe are asked to find the most general form of the cooperative diffusion coefficient, $D_c(c)$, based on dimensional analysis using the physical quantities $k_B T$ (energy), $\\eta_s$ (shear viscosity), $a$ (monomer length), and $c$ (monomer number density). Let us list the physical dimensions of these quantities, using $L$ for length, $M$ for mass, and $T_{time}$ for time.\nThe dimension of the diffusion coefficient is $[D_c] = L^2 T_{time}^{-1}$.\nThe dimension of thermal energy is $[k_B T] = M L^2 T_{time}^{-2}$.\nThe dimension of shear viscosity is $[\\eta_s] = M L^{-1} T_{time}^{-1}$.\nThe dimension of monomer length is $[a] = L$.\nThe dimension of monomer number density is $[c] = L^{-3}$.\n\nOur goal is to construct a quantity with the dimensions of $D_c$ from the given parameters. The Stokes-Einstein relation suggests that a diffusion coefficient is typically proportional to $k_B T$ and inversely proportional to a viscosity and a characteristic length. Let us examine the combination $\\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s a}$. Its dimensions are:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s a}\\right] = \\frac{[k_B T]}{[\\eta_s][a]} = \\frac{M L^2 T_{time}^{-2}}{(M L^{-1} T_{time}^{-1})(L)} = \\frac{M L^2 T_{time}^{-2}}{M T_{time}^{-1}} = L^2 T_{time}^{-1}\n$$\nThis combination has the correct dimensions of a diffusion coefficient.\nNext, we must find all possible dimensionless combinations of the given parameters. The concentration $c$ and the monomer size $a$ are the only parameters that can be combined to form a dimensionless group. The quantity $c a^3$ has dimensions $[c][a]^3 = (L^{-3})(L^3) = L^0$, so it is dimensionless. This quantity, $\\phi = c a^3$, represents the effective volume fraction occupied by the monomers.\n\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, any physical law relating these quantities must be an equation relating their dimensionless combinations. We can express the dimensionless group $\\frac{D_c}{k_B T / (\\eta_s a)}$ as a function of the dimensionless group $c a^3$.\n$$\n\\frac{D_c(c)}{k_B T / (\\eta_s a)} = f(c a^3)\n$$\nwhere $f$ is an unknown dimensionless function. Therefore, the most general form of $D_c(c)$ is:\n$$\nD_c(c) = \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s a} f(c a^3)\n$$\n\nStep 2: Deduction of the Power-Law Form using the Blob Model\n\nIn the semi-dilute regime, the polymer solution is pictured as a network or mesh of entangled chains with a characteristic mesh size, the correlation length $\\xi$. The problem states that hydrodynamic dissipation for long-wavelength concentration fluctuations is governed by this length scale $\\xi$. This is a crucial physical insight. The cooperative diffusion process involves the collective motion of segments of the polymer mesh, and its rate is limited by the hydrodynamic friction experienced by these segments as they move through the solvent. The relevant object for this friction is a \"blob\" of size $\\xi$.\n\nThe Einstein relation links diffusivity to mobility $\\mu$ via $D_c = \\mu k_B T$. Mobility is the reciprocal of the friction coefficient, $\\mu = 1/\\zeta$. For an object of size $\\ell$ moving in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta_s$, the friction coefficient scales as $\\zeta \\propto \\eta_s \\ell$ (Stokes' law). Setting the characteristic length scale $\\ell$ to be the correlation length $\\xi$, we have $\\zeta \\propto \\eta_s \\xi$. This leads to a scaling relation for the cooperative diffusion coefficient:\n$$\nD_c(c) \\propto \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s \\xi(c)}\n$$\nNow we must find the dependence of $\\xi$ on the monomer concentration $c$ using the provided blob model relations for the semi-dilute regime in a good solvent:\n1) $c \\simeq g/\\xi^3$, where $g$ is the number of monomers per blob.\n2) $\\xi \\simeq a g^{\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the Flory exponent for a self-avoiding walk.\n\nFrom the second relation, we can express $g$ in terms of $\\xi$: $g \\simeq (\\xi/a)^{1/\\nu}$.\nSubstituting this into the first relation allows us to eliminate $g$:\n$$\nc \\simeq \\frac{1}{\\xi^3} \\left(\\frac{\\xi}{a}\\right)^{1/\\nu} = \\xi^{1/\\nu - 3} a^{-1/\\nu}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $\\xi$ as a function of $c$:\n$$\n\\xi^{1/\\nu - 3} \\simeq c a^{1/\\nu} \\implies \\xi^{(1-3\\nu)/\\nu} \\simeq c a^{1/\\nu}\n$$\n$$\n\\xi(c) \\simeq \\left(c a^{1/\\nu}\\right)^{\\frac{\\nu}{1-3\\nu}} = c^{\\frac{\\nu}{1-3\\nu}} a^{\\frac{1}{1-3\\nu}}\n$$\nSince for a good solvent $\\nu \\approx 3/5$, the exponent $\\frac{\\nu}{1-3\\nu}$ is negative, which correctly indicates that the correlation length $\\xi$ decreases as concentration $c$ increases.\n\nNow we substitute this scaling for $\\xi(c)$ into our expression for $D_c(c)$:\n$$\nD_c(c) \\propto \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s \\xi(c)} \\propto \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s} \\left(c^{\\frac{\\nu}{1-3\\nu}} a^{\\frac{1}{1-3\\nu}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s} c^{-\\frac{\\nu}{1-3\\nu}} a^{-\\frac{1}{1-3\\nu}} = \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s} c^{\\frac{\\nu}{3\\nu-1}} a^{\\frac{1}{3\\nu-1}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this to be written in the form $D_c(c) \\propto \\frac{k_B T}{\\eta_s a} [c a^3]^{\\alpha}$.

Substituting our expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n3\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{3\\nu-1}\\right) - 1 = \\frac{3\\nu - (3\\nu - 1)}{3\\nu - 1} = \\frac{1}{3\\nu - 1}\n$$\nThe relation is consistent. Thus, the exponent is $\\alpha = \\frac{\\nu}{3\\nu-1}$.\n\nStep 3: Specialization for a Good Solvent\n\nFor a good solvent, the Flory exponent for a self-avoiding walk is $\\nu = 3/5$. We substitute this value into our expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\nu}{3\\nu - 1} = \\frac{3/5}{3(3/5) - 1} = \\frac{3/5}{9/5 - 1} = \\frac{3/5}{9/5 - 5/5} = \\frac{3/5}{4/5}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe final value for the exponent is $3/4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\n$$", "id": "2909876"}, {"introduction": "The collective dynamics explored in the previous exercise are driven by thermodynamic forces that resist concentration gradients, which are quantified by the solution's osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$.

It presents a standard, solvable problem in the scaling theory of polymer solutions. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a semidilute solution of flexible polymer chains in a theta solvent. In the semidilute regime, defined by the monomer concentration $c_m$ being above the overlap concentration $c_m^*$, the chains overlap significantly. This complex many-body system can be simplified using a scaling approach, pioneered by de Gennes. The central idea is that on length scales smaller than a characteristic correlation length $\\xi$, a chain segment does not interact with other chains and thus exhibits single-chain statistics. On scales larger than $\\xi$, the solution is homogeneous, and the details of individual chains are screened out. The length $\\xi$ can be visualized as the average mesh size of the transient network formed by the entangled polymers.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three steps as requested.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the correlation length $\\xi$ and the monomer concentration $c_m$.\nLet us consider a \"blob\" of size $\\xi$. A chain segment that fits within this blob consists of $g$ monomers of size $a$. Since the chain conformation is unperturbed inside the blob, it follows the statistics of an isolated chain in the given solvent. For a theta solvent, the polymer is described by an ideal random walk model. The end-to-end distance $R$ for a chain of $N$ segments scales as $R \\sim a N^{1/2}$. Applying this to our blob of size $\\xi$ containing $g$ monomers, we have:\n$$\n\\xi \\approx a g^{1/2}\n$$\nThis implies that the number of monomers per blob is $g \\approx (\\xi/a)^2$.\n\nThe second piece of information comes from a self-consistency condition. The blob model is valid if the local monomer concentration inside a blob is, on average, equal to the overall macroscopic monomer concentration $c_m$ of the solution. The volume of a blob is $\\xi^3$. The monomer concentration within a blob is therefore $g/\\xi^3$. Setting this equal to the bulk concentration $c_m$ yields:\n$$\nc_m \\approx \\frac{g}{\\xi^3}\n$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $\\xi$ and $g$. We can eliminate $g$ to find how $\\xi$ depends on $c_m$. Substituting $g \\approx (\\xi/a)^2$ into the concentration relation gives:\n$$\nc_m \\approx \\frac{(\\xi/a)^2}{\\xi^3} = \\frac{1}{a^2 \\xi}\n$$\nSolving for the correlation length $\\xi$, we find its scaling with monomer concentration:\n$$\n\\xi \\approx \\frac{1}{a^2 c_m}\n$$\nThis result shows that as the solution becomes more concentrated (increasing $c_m$), the mesh size $\\xi$ of the polymer network decreases, as expected.\n\nSecond, we relate the free energy density of the solution to $\\xi$ and thence to the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$. In the semidilute regime, the osmotic pressure arises from the interactions between polymer segments. In the blob model, the solution is pictured as a space-filling packing of blobs of size $\\xi$. The dominant contribution to the free energy comes from the entropy loss due to confinement or, equivalently, from the interactions between blobs. The density of these blobs is approximately $1/\\xi^3$. Each blob, representing a degree of freedom or an elementary interacting unit, contributes an energy on the order of the thermal energy, $k_B T$. Therefore, the free energy per unit volume, $f$, scales as the density of blobs multiplied by the thermal energy per blob:\n$$\nf \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{\\xi^3}\n$$\nThe osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ is the thermodynamic quantity that has the same units and scaling as the free energy density. Formally, for a solution, $\\Pi = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T,N_{polymers}}$, and scaling arguments show that $\\Pi$ scales directly with $f$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{\\xi^3}\n$$\n\nThird, we combine these results to obtain the final expression for $\\Pi$ as a function of $c_m$. By substituting the expression for $\\xi$ from our first step into the expression for $\\Pi$, we get:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx k_B T \\left( \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\right)^3 \\approx k_B T (a^2 c_m)^3 = k_B T a^6 c_m^3\n$$\nTo present this in the requested form, we identify the dimensionless monomer concentration as $\\phi_m = a^3 c_m$. We can then rewrite the scaling law for $\\Pi$ as:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx k_B T a^{-3} (a^9 c_m^3) = k_B T a^{-3} (a^3 c_m)^3\n$$\nThis is a scaling relationship, meaning it is accurate up to a numerical prefactor of order unity, which is ignored in this type of analysis.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result by comparing it to the case of a good solvent. In a good solvent, repulsive excluded-volume interactions cause the chain to swell. Its size scales as $R \\sim a N^{\\nu}$ with the Flory exponent $\\nu \\approx 3/5$ (in $3$ dimensions). A similar scaling analysis for a good solvent yields $\\Pi \\sim c_m^{9/4}$.\nComparing the two results:\n- Theta solvent: $\\Pi \\sim c_m^3$.\n- Good solvent: $\\Pi \\sim c_m^{9/4} \\approx c_m^{2.25}$.\n\nThe concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure is stronger in a theta solvent than in a good solvent for the semidilute regime ($3 > 9/4$). The physical reason for this lies in the nature of the dominant interactions. A theta solvent is defined as a solvent in which the second virial coefficient $A_2$, which quantifies effective two-body interactions between chains, is zero. At low concentrations in the dilute regime, the chains behave ideally. However, in the semidilute regime, chains are forced to interact. Since pair interactions are screened on average, the leading contribution to the interaction free energy, and thus to the osmotic pressure, comes from three-body collisions. A term representing three-body interactions in a virial-like expansion for the free energy would be proportional to the cube of the concentration, $c_m^3$, which is precisely the scaling we derived. In contrast, for a good solvent, $A_2 > 0$, and repulsive two-body interactions are dominant. The scaling $\\Pi \\sim c_m^{9/4}$ reflects the physics of these screened two-body repulsions on a fractal structure (the polymer network), resulting in a weaker concentration dependence than the $c_m^3$ law for three-body interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_B T a^{-3} (a^3 c_m)^3}$$", "id": "2909896"}]}
