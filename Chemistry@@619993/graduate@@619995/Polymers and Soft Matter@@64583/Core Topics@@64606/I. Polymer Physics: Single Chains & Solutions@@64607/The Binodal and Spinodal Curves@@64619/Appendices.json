Physical Interpretation of Derivatives**\n\nIn the thermodynamics of binary mixtures, the first derivative of the free energy density with respect to composition is related to the difference in chemical potentials. Specifically, $f'(\\phi)$ is proportional to the exchange chemical potential, $\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_{2}/N_{2} - \\mu_{1}/N_{1}$, which is the chemical potential difference per segment. This quantity represents the thermodynamic force driving interdiffusion of components. At phase equilibrium between two phases $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ with compositions $\\phi^{\\alpha}$ and $\\phi^{\\beta}$, the chemical potentials of each component must be equal in both phases, which implies $f'(\\phi^{\\alpha}) = f'(\\phi^{\\beta})$.\n\nThe second derivative, $f''(\\phi)$, determines the local thermodynamic stability of the mixture. For a homogeneous mixture to be stable against infinitesimal composition fluctuations, the free energy curve must be convex, meaning $f''(\\phi) > 0$. If $f''(\\phi) < 0$, the mixture is unstable and will spontaneously separate via spinodal decomposition. The condition $f''(\\phi) = 0$ defines the limit of this local stability.\n\n**3. Spinodal Condition and Relation**\n\nThe spinodal curve separates the metastable and unstable regions of the phase diagram. It is defined by the locus of points where the second derivative of the free energy with respect to composition is zero. This is the curvature criterion for the onset of instability.\nThe spinodal condition is therefore:\n$$\nf''(\\phi) = 0\n$$\nUsing our expression for $f''(\\phi)$ (and noting that $k_{B}T \\neq 0$), this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi)} - 2\\chi = 0\n$$\nThis equation is the implicit spinodal relation between $\\phi$ and $\\chi$. We can express the spinodal interaction parameter, $\\chi_{sp}$, as an explicit function of composition $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\chi_{sp}(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi)} \\right]\n$$\n\n**4. The Critical Point**\n\nThe critical point is a unique point on the phase boundary where the distinction between two coexisting phases vanishes. It lies on the spinodal curve and is identified as the point where the stability condition is first violated. Mathematically, it is an inflection point of the free energy curve where both the second and third derivatives are zero.\nThe conditions for the critical point ($\\phi_{c}$, $\\chi_{c}$) are:\n1. $f''(\\phi_{c}) = 0$\n2. $f'''(\\phi_{c}) = 0$\n\nFirst, we find the third derivative, $f'''(\\phi)$, by differentiating $g''(\\phi)$ and multiplying by $k_{B}T$:\n$$\ng'''(\\phi) = \\frac{d}{d\\phi} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi} \\right) + \\frac{d}{d\\phi} \\left( \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi)} \\right) - \\frac{d}{d\\phi} \\left( 2\\chi \\right)\n$$\n$$\ng'''(\\phi) = -\\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi^{2}} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi)^{2}}\n$$\nSo, $f'''(\\phi) = k_{B}T \\left[ -\\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi^{2}} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi)^{2}} \\right]$.\n\nApplying the second condition, $f'''(\\phi_{c}) = 0$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi_{c}^{2}} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi_{c})^{2}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi_{c})^{2}} = \\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi_{c}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nN_{2}\\phi_{c}^{2} = N_{1}(1-\\phi_{c})^{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (and considering only the physically meaningful positive root since $\\phi_{c} > 0$ and $1-\\phi_{c} > 0$), we get:\n$$\n\\sqrt{N_{2}}\\phi_{c} = \\sqrt{N_{1}}(1-\\phi_{c})\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{N_{2}}\\phi_{c} = \\sqrt{N_{1}} - \\sqrt{N_{1}}\\phi_{c}\n$$\n$$\n(\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}})\\phi_{c} = \\sqrt{N_{1}}\n$$\nThis gives the critical composition:\n$$\n\\phi_{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}\n$$\nNow, we find $\\chi_{c}$ by substituting $\\phi_{c}$ into the spinodal relation (the first condition, $f''(\\phi_{c})=0$):\n$$\n\\chi_{c} = \\chi_{sp}(\\phi_{c}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_{2}\\phi_{c}} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}(1-\\phi_{c})} \\right]\n$$\nFrom the expression for $\\phi_{c}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\phi_{c}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}}}\n$$\nAnd for $1-\\phi_{c}$:\n$$\n1-\\phi_{c} = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}} - \\sqrt{N_{1}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}\n$$\nSo, $\\frac{1}{1-\\phi_{c}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{2}}}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\chi_{c}$:\n$$\n\\chi_{c} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{N_{1}}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{2}}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nFactor out the common term $(\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}})$:\n$$\n\\chi_{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_{2}\\sqrt{N_{1}}} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}\\sqrt{N_{2}}} \\right]\n$$\nTo simplify the bracketed term, find a common denominator, $\\sqrt{N_{1}N_{2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_{2}\\sqrt{N_{1}}} + \\frac{1}{N_{1}\\sqrt{N_{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{1}}(\\sqrt{N_{2}})^{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{2}}(\\sqrt{N_{1}})^{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}}N_{2}\\sqrt{N_{1}} + N_{1}\\sqrt{N_{2}}\\sqrt{N_{1}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{1}} + \\sqrt{N_{2}}}{N_{1}N_{2}}\n$$\nThis path is cumbersome.

Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\phi^2} = 0, \\quad \\text{for } \\phi \\in (0,1)\n$$\nTo derive the spinodal equation, we compute the first and second derivatives of $f(\\phi;T)$ with respect to $\\phi$:\nFirst derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{1}{N_1}(\\ln \\phi + 1) - \\frac{1}{N_2}(\\ln(1-\\phi) + 1) + \\chi(T)(1 - 2\\phi)\n$$\nSecond derivative (curvature):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\phi^2} = \\frac{1}{N_1 \\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_2 (1-\\phi)} - 2\\chi(T)\n$$\nSetting the second derivative to zero yields the spinodal equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_1 \\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_2 (1-\\phi)} - 2\\chi(T) = 0\n$$\nThis equation defines the spinodal compositions $\\phi_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ for a given set of parameters $(N_1, N_2, \\chi)$.\n\nTo analyze the number of solutions, it is instructive to express the interaction parameter $\\chi$ as a function of the spinodal composition $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{sp}}(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N_1 \\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_2 (1-\\phi)} \\right]\n$$\nThis function describes the spinodal curve in the $(\\phi, \\chi)$ plane. The number of solutions for $\\phi$ at a given $\\chi(T)$ depends on the value of $\\chi(T)$ relative to the minimum of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{sp}}(\\phi)$. This minimum represents the critical point for phase separation.\n\nThe critical point $(\\phi_c, \\chi_c)$ is found by minimizing $\\chi_{\\mathrm{sp}}(\\phi)$ with respect to $\\phi$, which is equivalent to setting the third derivative of the free energy to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\chi_{\\mathrm{sp}}}{d\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^3 f}{\\partial \\phi^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{1}{N_1 \\phi^2} + \\frac{1}{N_2 (1-\\phi)^2} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the critical composition $\\phi_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N_1 \\phi_c^2} = \\frac{1}{N_2 (1-\\phi_c)^2} \\implies \\sqrt{N_2}(1-\\phi_c) = \\sqrt{N_1}\\phi_c\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_2}}{\\sqrt{N_1} + \\sqrt{N_2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{N_1/N_2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\phi_c$ back into the expression for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{sp}}(\\phi)$ yields the critical interaction parameter $\\chi_c$:\n$$\n\\chi_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_1}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_2}} \\right)^2\n$$\nFor the given parameters $N_1=1$ and $N_2=1000$:\n$$\n\\phi_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{1000}}{\\sqrt{1} + \\sqrt{1000}} \\approx 0.96934651\n$$\n$$\n\\chi_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1000}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{10\\sqrt{10}} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.53212280\n$$\nThe system exhibits phase separation only when the interaction parameter $\\chi(T)$ exceeds this critical value $\\chi_c$.\n- If $\\chi(T) > \\chi_c$, there are two distinct spinodal compositions.\n- If $\\chi(T) = \\chi_c$, there is exactly one spinodal composition, $\\phi = \\phi_c$. This occurs at the critical temperature, $T_c$.\n- If $\\chi(T) < \\chi_c$, there are no real solutions for $\\phi \\in (0,1)$, and the mixture is stable at all compositions.\n\nThe critical temperature $T_c$ is found by solving $\\chi(T_c) = \\chi_c$ using the given temperature dependence $\\chi(T) = 0.4 + 50/T$:\n$$\n0.4 + \\frac{50}{T_c} = \\chi_c \\implies T_c = \\frac{50}{\\chi_c - 0.4}\n$$\nUsing the calculated value of $\\chi_c$:\n$$\nT_c \\approx \\frac{50}{0.53212280 - 0.4} = \\frac{50}{0.13212280} \\approx 378.423001 \\text{ K}\n$$\n\nThe numerical algorithm is designed based on this analysis. For each temperature $T$ in the test suite:\n1.  Calculate $\\chi(T) = 0.4 + 50/T$.\n2.  Compare $\\chi(T)$ to the pre-calculated $\\chi_c$.\n3.  If $\\chi(T) < \\chi_c$ (or $T > T_c$), there are no solutions.\n4.  If $\\chi(T) > \\chi_c$ (or $T < T_c$), there are two solutions. These are found by numerically solving the nonlinear equation $\\frac{1}{N_1 \\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_2 (1-\\phi)} - 2\\chi(T) = 0$. The roots are bracketed by $(0, \\phi_c)$ and $(\\phi_c, 1)$ and can be efficiently found using a stable algorithm such as Brent's method.\n5.  If $\\chi(T)$ is numerically indistinguishable from $\\chi_c$, the single solution is $\\phi_c$. A small tolerance must be used to handle this case in floating-point arithmetic.\n\nOne of the test temperatures is $T^*=378.7878787879$ K. This value is slightly greater than the calculated critical temperature $T_c \\approx 378.423$ K. At this temperature, $\\chi(T^*) \\approx 0.5320 < \\chi_c$, placing the system in the one-phase (miscible) region. Therefore, according to rigorous application of the theory, no spinodal compositions should exist at this temperature. The algorithm will correctly identify this case.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each input temperature $T$:\n- Calculate $\\chi(T)$.\n- The function to find roots of is $g(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{N_1\\phi} + \\frac{1}{N_2(1-\\phi)} - 2\\chi(T)$. The minimum value of the first two terms is $2\\chi_c$, occurring at $\\phi_c$. Therefore, the minimum value of $g(\\phi)$ is $2(\\chi_c - \\chi(T))$.\n- If $2(\\chi_c - \\chi(T)) > \\epsilon$ (a small positive tolerance), the minimum of $g(\\phi)$ is positive, so there are no roots.\n- If $|2(\\chi_c - \\chi(T))| \\le \\epsilon$, we are at the critical point, and the solution is $[\\phi_c]$.\n- If $2(\\chi_c - \\chi(T)) < -\\epsilon$, the minimum is negative, and two roots exist. They are found using `scipy.optimize.brentq` in the intervals $(0, \\phi_c)$ and $(\\phi_c, 1)$.
