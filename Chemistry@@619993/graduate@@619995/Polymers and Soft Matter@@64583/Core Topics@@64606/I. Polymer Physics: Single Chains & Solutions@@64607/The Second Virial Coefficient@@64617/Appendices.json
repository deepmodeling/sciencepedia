It is self-contained and free of contradictions. The setup is a standard theoretical problem in polymer physics and is therefore scientifically feasible. There are no ambiguities that would render the problem ill-posed. The problem is directly related to the specified topic of the second virial coefficient in polymer science.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by diligently following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we begin with the low-density virial expansion of the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ in terms of the polymer number density $\\rho$. This is given by the exact statistical mechanical result:\n$$ \\Pi = k_{B} T (\\rho + B_{2} \\rho^2 + O(\\rho^3)) $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $B_{2}$ is the second virial coefficient on a per-particle basis. For dimensional consistency within this equation, the term $k_B T B_2 \\rho^2$ must have units of pressure. The units of $\\rho$ are number per volume, or $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The units of $k_B T$ are energy, or $\\mathrm{J}$. Thus, the units of $B_2$ must be volume, $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nNext, we must rewrite this expansion in terms of the mass concentration $c$. The number density $\\rho$ (number of polymers per unit volume) is related to the mass concentration $c$ (mass of polymer per unit volume) and the molar mass $M$ (mass of polymer per mole) via the Avogadro constant $N_{A}$ (number of entities per mole). The number of moles per unit volume is given by the ratio $c/M$. Therefore, the number of polymer chains per unit volume is:\n$$ \\rho = N_{A} \\frac{c}{M} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho$ into the virial expansion for $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi = k_{B} T \\left( N_{A} \\frac{c}{M} + B_{2} \\left(N_{A} \\frac{c}{M}\\right)^2 + \\dots \\right) $$\nWe can rearrange this expression by distributing the $k_{B}T$ term and using the definition of the universal gas constant, $R = N_{A} k_{B}$:\n$$ \\Pi = (k_{B} N_{A}) T \\frac{c}{M} + k_{B} T B_{2} N_{A}^2 \\frac{c^2}{M^2} + \\dots $$\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{RT}{M} c + \\frac{RT B_{2} N_{A}}{M^2} c^2 + \\dots $$\nThe problem instructs to identify the second virial coefficient $A_{2}$ \"as used in polymer science\". In polymer physical chemistry, the standard form of the osmotic pressure expansion in terms of mass concentration is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Pi}{c} = RT \\left( \\frac{1}{M} + A_{2} c + A_{3} c^2 + \\dots \\right) $$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{RT}{M} c + (RT A_{2}) c^2 + (RT A_{3}) c^3 + \\dots $$\nBy comparing the coefficient of the $c^{2}$ term in our derived expansion with the coefficient of the $c^{2}$ term in the standard polymer science convention, we establish the identity for $A_{2}$.\nFrom our derivation, the coefficient of $c^2$ is $\\frac{RT B_{2} N_{A}}{M^2}$. From the standard convention, it is $RT A_{2}$. Equating these gives:\n$$ RT A_{2} = \\frac{RT B_{2} N_{A}}{M^2} $$\n$$ A_{2} = \\frac{B_{2} N_{A}}{M^2} $$\nThe final task is to determine the SI units of this specific coefficient $A_{2}$. This requires a dimensional analysis. Let $[X]$ denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$.\nWe require the units of $A_{2}$:\n$$ [A_{2}] = \\frac{[B_{2}] [N_{A}]}{[M]^2} $$\nThe base SI units for the quantities on the right-hand side are:\n- $[B_{2}]$: As established earlier, the second virial coefficient $B_{2}$ has units of volume. In SI units, this is $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n- $[N_{A}]$: The Avogadro constant has units of inverse moles, $\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n- $[M]$: The molar mass is given in units of mass per mole, $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting these units into the expression for $[A_{2}]$:\n$$ [A_{2}] = \\frac{(\\mathrm{m}^{3}) (\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}{(\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{kg}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-2}} $$\nSimplifying the expression for the units:\n$$ [A_{2}] = \\mathrm{kg}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{(-1 - (-2))} = \\mathrm{kg}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{1} $$\nThe problem asks for the exponents $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta, \\varepsilon)$ corresponding to the unit representation $\\mathrm{kg}^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{\\beta}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{\\gamma}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{\\delta}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{\\varepsilon}$. By comparing our result with this form, we can identify the exponents:\n- $\\alpha = -2$ (exponent of $\\mathrm{kg}$)\n- $\\beta = 3$ (exponent of $\\mathrm{m}$)\n- $\\gamma = 0$ (exponent of $\\mathrm{s}$, as seconds do not appear)\n- $\\delta = 1$ (exponent of $\\mathrm{mol}$)\n- $\\varepsilon = 0$ (exponent of $\\mathrm{K}$, as Kelvin does not appear)\n\nThe resulting ordered set of exponents is $(-2, 3, 0, 1, 0)$.\n\nAlternatively, one can perform the dimensional analysis directly on the standard osmotic pressure equation for polymer solutions:\n$$ \\frac{\\Pi}{c} = \\frac{RT}{M} + RTA_2 c + \\dots $$\nAccording to the principle of dimensional homogeneity, each term in this sum must have the same units. Let us verify the units of the first term, $\\frac{RT}{M}$:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{RT}{M}\\right] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}] [\\mathrm{K}]}{[\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{J}]}{[\\mathrm{kg}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}]}{[\\mathrm{kg}]} = \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2} $$\nTherefore, the term $RTA_2 c$ must also have units of $\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\n$$ [RTA_2 c] = \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2} $$\n$$ [A_2] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}]}{[R][T][c]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{(\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (\\mathrm{K}) (\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})} = \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{(\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) (\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})} $$\nSubstituting J = $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$:\n$$ [A_2] = \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{(\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) (\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})} = \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{\\mathrm{kg}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{kg}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{1} $$\nThis confirms the previous result.
