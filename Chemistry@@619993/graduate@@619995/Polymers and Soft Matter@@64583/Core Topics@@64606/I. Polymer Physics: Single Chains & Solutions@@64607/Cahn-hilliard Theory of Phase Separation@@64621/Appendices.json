The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and equations to perform a standard linear stability analysis. The parameters ($M$, $\\kappa$, $\\phi_0$) are symbolic, and the functions are defined with sufficient regularity (e.g., $f(\\phi)$ is twice-differentiable). The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is a standard, non-trivial exercise in mathematical physics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, the explicit form of the chemical potential $\\mu$ is determined from its definition as a variational derivative. Second, this expression for $\\mu$ is substituted into the Cahn-Hilliard dynamical equation. Third, the resulting partial differential equation is linearized with respect to the small perturbation $\\delta\\phi$ around the uniform base state $\\phi_0$. Finally, by considering a single Fourier mode for the perturbation, the dispersion relation $\\omega(k)$ is extracted.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the chemical potential $\\mu$.\nThe chemical potential $\\mu$ is the variational derivative of the free-energy functional $\\mathcal{F}[\\phi]$ with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta \\phi} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\phi} \\int_{\\Omega} \\left[ f(\\phi) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} |\\nabla \\phi|^{2} \\right] \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional with integrand $L(\\phi, \\nabla\\phi) = f(\\phi) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}|\\nabla\\phi|^2$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} - \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (\\nabla\\phi)} \\right)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $L$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\phi} = f'(\\phi)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (\\nabla\\phi)} = \\kappa \\nabla\\phi\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions gives the chemical potential:\n$$\n\\mu = f'(\\phi) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 \\phi\n$$\n\nStep 2: Substitution into the Cahn-Hilliard equation.\nThe Cahn-Hilliard equation for a constant mobility $M$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 \\mu\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu$ yields the full non-linear equation, often called the Cahn-Hilliard equation of fourth order:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 \\left( f'(\\phi) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 \\phi \\right) = M \\left( \\nabla^2(f'(\\phi)) - \\kappa \\nabla^4 \\phi \\right)\n$$\n\nStep 3: Linearization around the uniform state $\\phi_0$.\nWe introduce the perturbation $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\phi_0 + \\delta\\phi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, where $\\phi_0$ is a constant and $|\\delta\\phi| \\ll 1$.\nThe time derivative is simply $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial\\delta\\phi}{\\partial t}$.\nFor the right-hand side, we linearize each term.

A deep quench corresponds to a large $\\Delta T$, which leads to a large $\\sigma_{\\max}$ and thus a shorter $t_{\\mathrm{nl}}$ compared to a shallow quench (small $\\Delta T$). This part of the statement is correct. A quench at the symmetric composition $\\phi_0=0$ into the spinodal region results in two phases of equal volume fractions, which characteristically forms a bicontinuous (interconnected) structure. The entire statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. For a shallow quench that lies in the metastable region at an off-critical composition $\\,\\phi_0=0.3\\,$, linearly unstable spinodal modes still grow, albeit slowly, and produce a bicontinuous network; the nonlinearity onset time satisfies $\\,t_{\\mathrm{nl}}\\sim 1/\\sigma_{\\max}\\,$ with $\\,\\sigma_{\\max}0\\,$.\nThe problem states the quench \"lies in the metastable region\". By definition, the metastable region is characterized by $f''(\\phi_0)0$. As derived above, in this case, the growth rate $\\sigma(k) = -M k^2 (f''(\\phi_0) + \\kappa k^2)$ is negative for all $k0$. There are no linearly unstable modes, meaning $\\sigma_{\\max} \\le 0$. The statement that \"linearly unstable spinodal modes still grow\" is a fundamental contradiction. Phase separation in the metastable region proceeds via nucleation and growth, a nonlinear process, not by the linear instability of spinodal decomposition.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. For a shallow quench just inside the spinodal at $\\,\\phi_0=0.3\\,$, the band of unstable wavenumbers is narrow and growth rates are small, so $\\,t_{\\mathrm{nl}}\\,$ is longer than for a deep quench; depending on whether the minority component percolates at this $\\,\\phi_0\\,$, the emerging structure can be bicontinuous.\nA shallow quench \"just inside the spinodal\" means that $f''(\\phi_0) = -a\\,\\Delta T + 3b\\,\\phi_0^2$ is negative but has a small magnitude. The width of the unstable band is determined by $k_c = \\sqrt{-f''(\\phi_0)/\\kappa}$. A small $|f''(\\phi_0)|$ implies a small $k_c$, so the band is narrow. The maximum growth rate is $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{M}{4\\kappa}(f''(\\phi_0))^2$, which will be very small. Consequently, $t_{\\mathrm{nl}} \\propto 1/\\sigma_{\\max}$ will be long, significantly longer than for a deep quench where $|f''(\\phi_0)|$ and $\\sigma_{\\max}$ are large. This part of the logic is correct. For an off-critical composition like $\\phi_0=0.3$, the volume fractions of the two phases are unequal. Assuming $\\phi = \\psi_A - \\psi_B$ and $\\psi_A + \\psi_B = 1$, the average volume fractions are $\\psi_{A,0} = (1+\\phi_0)/2 = 0.65$ and $\\psi_{B,0} = (1-\\phi_0)/2 = 0.35$. The minority phase has a volume fraction of $0.35$. In three dimensions, this value is near or above the typical percolation threshold (around $0.31$). Whether a bicontinuous structure forms depends on whether this minority phase can form a percolating network. The statement accurately reflects this physical consideration.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Deeper quenches shift the most unstable wavelength to larger length scales, so the characteristic domain size at early times is larger than for shallow quenches.\nThe most unstable wavelength is $\\lambda_{\\max} = 2\\pi/k_{\\max}$. The characteristic wavenumber is $k_{\\max} = \\sqrt{(a\\,\\Delta T - 3b\\,\\phi_0^2)/(2\\kappa)}$. A deeper quench means a larger $\\Delta T$. This increases the value of the term under the square root, so $k_{\\max}$ increases with quench depth. Since $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is inversely proportional to $k_{\\max}$, a larger $k_{\\max}$ corresponds to a *smaller* $\\lambda_{\\max}$. Therefore, deeper quenches shift the most unstable wavelength to *smaller*, not larger, length scales. The statement is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In the Landau–Cahn–Hilliard model with constant mobility, the most unstable wavenumber increases with quench depth, implying a smaller initial characteristic domain size for deeper quenches.\nAs established in the analysis for option D, the most unstable wavenumber is $k_{\\max} = \\sqrt{(a\\,\\Delta T - 3b\\,\\phi_0^2)/(2\\kappa)}$. Increasing the quench depth $\\Delta T$ directly increases $k_{\\max}$. The first part of the statement is correct. The initial characteristic domain size is proportional to $\\lambda_{\\max} = 2\\pi/k_{\\max}$. As $k_{\\max}$ increases with quench depth, the characteristic domain size $\\lambda_{\\max}$ decreases.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or unphysical assumptions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution may be pursued.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps:\n1.  Determine the bulk equilibrium compositions $ \\pm\\phi_{b} $.\n2.  Derive the equilibrium interface profile $ \\phi(x) $ by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation.\n3.  Calculate the interfacial tension $ \\gamma $ using the derived profile.\n\nStep 1: Determine the bulk compositions $ \\phi_{b} $.\nThe bulk compositions correspond to the minima of the local free-energy density $ f(\\phi) $.
