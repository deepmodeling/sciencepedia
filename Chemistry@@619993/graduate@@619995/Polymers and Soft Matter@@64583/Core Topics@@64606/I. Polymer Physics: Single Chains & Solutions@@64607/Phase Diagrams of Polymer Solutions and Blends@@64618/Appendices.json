The miscibility of two polymers is governed by the change in the Gibbs free energy of mixing, which is a balance between the entropic drive to mix and the enthalpic cost or benefit of new intermolecular contacts. This first exercise provides essential practice in applying the core Flory-Huggins equation to calculate the free energy density for a binary polymer blend and encourages a quantitative comparison of the entropic and enthalpic contributions, building intuition for the forces that control polymer phase behavior [@problem_id:2922446].", "problem": "A binary polymer blend is modeled on a coordination-free lattice using the Flory–Huggins mean-field picture of mixing.

It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The parameters given are physically realistic. The problem is a standard exercise in statistical mechanics of polymers and is therefore valid.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy of mixing, $\\Delta G_{mix}$, is given by the standard thermodynamic relation:\n$$ \\Delta G_{mix} = \\Delta H_{mix} - T \\Delta S_{mix} $$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{mix}$ is the enthalpy of mixing and $\\Delta S_{mix}$ is the entropy of mixing. The problem asks for the free energy density of mixing per lattice site, $f$, which is obtained by dividing $\\Delta G_{mix}$ by the total number of lattice sites, $N_{sites}$. We seek the nondimensional form $f/(k_B T)$.\n$$ \\frac{f}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{mix}}{N_{sites} k_B T} - \\frac{\\Delta S_{mix}}{N_{sites} k_B} $$\n\nWe derive the entropic and enthalpic contributions separately.\n\n1. Entropy of Mixing:\nThe statistical mechanical athermal entropy of mixing for a system of $n_1$ polymer chains of length $N_1$ and $n_2$ chains of length $N_2$ on a lattice is given by the Flory-Huggins result:\n$$ \\Delta S_{mix} = -k_B (n_1 \\ln \\phi_1 + n_2 \\ln \\phi_2) $$\nwhere $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ are the volume fractions of the two species. In the problem's notation, $\\phi_1=\\phi$ and $\\phi_2=1-\\phi$. The total number of lattice sites is $N_{sites} = n_1 N_1 + n_2 N_2$. The volume fractions are defined as $\\phi = n_1 N_1 / N_{sites}$ and $1-\\phi = n_2 N_2 / N_{sites}$. From these definitions, we can express the number of molecules $n_1$ and $n_2$ as:\n$$ n_1 = \\frac{\\phi N_{sites}}{N_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_2 = \\frac{(1-\\phi) N_{sites}}{N_2} $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $\\Delta S_{mix}$:\n$$ \\Delta S_{mix} = -k_B \\left( \\frac{\\phi N_{sites}}{N_1} \\ln \\phi + \\frac{(1-\\phi) N_{sites}}{N_2} \\ln(1-\\phi) \\right) $$\nTo find the entropy of mixing per lattice site, we divide by $N_{sites}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta S_{mix}}{N_{sites}} = -k_B \\left( \\frac{\\phi}{N_1} \\ln \\phi + \\frac{1-\\phi}{N_2} \\ln(1-\\phi) \\right) $$\nThe nondimensional entropic contribution to the free energy density is therefore:\n$$ -\\frac{\\Delta S_{mix}}{N_{sites} k_B} = \\frac{\\phi}{N_1} \\ln \\phi + \\frac{1-\\phi}{N_2} \\ln(1-\\phi) $$\n\n2. Enthalpy of Mixing:\nIn the mean-field approximation, the enthalpy of mixing arises from the change in contact energies when the polymers are mixed. The change in energy for forming a contact between a segment of type $1$ and a segment of type $2$ from pure-component contacts is packaged into the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter $\\chi$. The total enthalpy of mixing is proportional to the number of $1$-$2$ contacts. The probability of finding a segment of type $1$ at a random site is $\\phi$, and that of finding a segment of type $2$ is $1-\\phi$. In a mean-field picture, the number of $1$-$2$ contacts is proportional to the product of their volume fractions, $\\phi(1-\\phi)$. The enthalpy of mixing per lattice site, $\\Delta h_{mix}$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta h_{mix} = k_B T \\chi \\phi (1-\\phi) $$\nThus, the nondimensional enthalpic contribution is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta H_{mix}}{N_{sites} k_B T} = \\frac{\\Delta h_{mix}}{k_B T} = \\chi \\phi (1-\\phi) $$\n\n3. Total Free Energy of Mixing:\nCombining the enthalpic and entropic terms, we obtain the final expression for the nondimensional free energy of mixing per lattice site:\n$$ \\frac{f(\\phi)}{k_B T} = \\chi \\phi (1-\\phi) + \\frac{\\phi}{N_1} \\ln \\phi + \\frac{1-\\phi}{N_2} \\ln(1-\\phi) $$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $N_1=100$, $N_2=200$, $\\chi=0.02$, and $\\phi=0.3$.\nFirst, calculate the enthalpic term:\n$$ \\text{Enthalpic term} = \\chi \\phi (1-\\phi) = (0.02)(0.3)(1-0.3) = (0.02)(0.3)(0.7) = 0.0042 $$\nNext, calculate the entropic term:\n$$ \\text{Entropic term} = \\frac{\\phi}{N_1} \\ln \\phi + \\frac{1-\\phi}{N_2} \\ln(1-\\phi) $$\n$$ = \\frac{0.3}{100} \\ln(0.3) + \\frac{1-0.3}{200} \\ln(1-0.3) $$\n$$ = (0.003) \\ln(0.3) + (0.0035) \\ln(0.7) $$\nUsing the natural logarithm: $\\ln(0.3) \\approx -1.20397$ and $\\ln(0.7) \\approx -0.35667$.\n$$ \\text{Entropic term} \\approx (0.003)(-1.20397) + (0.0035)(-0.35667) $$\n$$ \\approx -0.0036119 - 0.0012483 = -0.0048602 $$\nThe total nondimensional free energy density is the sum of these two terms:\n$$ \\frac{f}{k_B T} \\approx 0.0042 - 0.0048602 = -0.0006602 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{f}{k_B T} \\approx -0.0006602 $$\nWait, the calculation needs to be more precise for rounding.\n$(0.003) \\times \\ln(0.3) \\approx -0.0036119184$\n$(0.0035) \\times \\ln(0.7) \\approx -0.0012483623$\nEntropic term $\\approx -0.0048602807$\nSum = $0.0042 - 0.0048602807 = -0.0006602807$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $-0.0006603$.\n\nFinally, we comment on the dominant contribution. The magnitude of the enthalpic contribution is $|0.0042| = 0.0042$. The magnitude of the entropic contribution is $|-0.0048603| \\approx 0.00486$. Since $0.00486 > 0.0042$, the entropic contribution to the free energy of mixing is slightly dominant for these parameters. This dominance of the negative entropic term over the positive enthalpic term results in an overall negative free energy of mixing, indicating that the blend is thermodynamically stable (miscible) at this composition and temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-6.603 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "2922446"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply calculating the free energy for a given state, the Flory-Huggins model allows us to predict the conditions under which a mixture will spontaneously phase separate.

Parameter Estimation**\nFor each dataset, we are given measurements of the second virial coefficient $A_2$ at various temperatures $T$.\nFirst, we transform the data $(T_i, A_{2,i})$ into $(x_i, y_i)$ coordinates suitable for linear regression, where $x_i = 1/T_i$ and $y_i = \\chi_i$:\n$$\n\\chi_i = \\frac{1}{2} - A_{2,i}\n$$\nWe then fit the model $\\chi(T) = A + B/T$, which is linear in the transformed coordinates: $y_i = A + Bx_i$. The parameters $A$ (intercept) and $B$ (slope) are determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $\\sum_i (y_i - (A+Bx_i))^2$. This is a standard linear least-squares problem.\n\n**3. Predictive Calculation**\nOnce the parameters $A$ and $B$ are determined, the model $\\chi(T) = A + B/T$ is fully specified. We can then predict the critical and spinodal temperatures. Since the given data shows $A_2$ increasing with $T$, $\\chi$ decreases with $T$, implying $B > 0$. This corresponds to UCST behavior, where phase separation occurs upon cooling.\nThe temperature $T$ can be expressed as a function of $\\chi$:\n$$\nT(\\chi) = \\frac{B}{\\chi - A}\n$$\nThe critical temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is obtained by setting $\\chi = \\chi_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{B}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{c}} - A}\n$$\nSimilarly, the spinodal temperature $T_{\\mathrm{s}}$ for a given composition $\\phi$ is found by setting $\\chi = \\chi_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi)$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) = \\frac{B}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) - A}\n$$\n\n**4.
