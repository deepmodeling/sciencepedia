It is well-posed, providing all necessary physical constants and initial conditions. The language is objective and precise. The tasks are clearly defined. No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are detected.\n\n### Verdict\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Debye Parameter $\\kappa$\nThe derivation begins with the Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi$ to the local net charge density $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\psi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the medium, given by $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{0}$.\n\nThe net charge density $\\rho$ is the sum of charges from all mobile ion species present in the electrolyte:\n$$\n\\rho = \\sum_{i} n_{i} z_{i} e\n$$\nwhere $n_{i}$ is the local number density of ion species $i$, $z_{i}$ is its valence, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe local number density $n_{i}$ depends on the local electrostatic potential $\\psi$ according to the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nn_{i}(\\psi) = n_{i}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{i} e \\psi}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_{i}^{\\infty}$ is the bulk number density of ion species $i$ (far from any charged surface where $\\psi \\to 0$), $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann distribution into the expression for charge density gives:\n$$\n\\rho = \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i} e \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{i} e \\psi}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of small electrostatic potentials, which means the argument of the exponential is much less than $1$: $|\\frac{z_{i} e \\psi}{k_{B} T}| \\ll 1$. We can therefore linearize the exponential function using the Taylor series expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i} e \\left(1 - \\frac{z_{i} e \\psi}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\nDistributing the terms yields:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i} e - \\left(\\frac{e^2 \\psi}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2\n$$\nThe first term, $\\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i} e$, represents the net charge density in the bulk solution. The bulk solution must be electrically neutral, so this term is zero. The expression for the charge density simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho \\approx -\\left(\\frac{e^2}{k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2\\right) \\psi\n$$\nNow, we substitute this linearized expression for $\\rho$ back into the Poisson equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\psi = -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left[ -\\left(\\frac{e^2}{k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2\\right) \\psi \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, also known as the Debye-Hückel equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\psi = \\left(\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2\\right) \\psi\n$$\nThis equation has the form $\\nabla^{2} \\psi = \\kappa^2 \\psi$, where $\\kappa^2$ is the Debye parameter squared. By comparison, we identify the expression for $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2\n$$\nThus, the Debye parameter $\\kappa$ is:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} \\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of the Debye Length $\\kappa^{-1}$\nTo perform the numerical calculation, we first express the summation term $\\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2$ in terms of the given ionic strength $I$. The ionic strength is defined in terms of molar concentrations $c_{i}$ as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^2\n$$\nThe bulk number density $n_{i}^{\\infty}$ is related to the molar concentration $c_{i}$ by Avogadro's number $N_{A}$, such that $n_{i}^{\\infty} = c_{i} N_{A}$. For this relationship to hold with SI units, $c_i$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$. The summation term can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2 = \\sum_{i} (c_{i} N_{A}) z_{i}^2 = N_{A} \\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^2\n$$\nFrom the definition of ionic strength, we have $\\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^2 = 2I$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} n_{i}^{\\infty} z_{i}^2 = 2 I N_{A}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\kappa^2$:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T} (2 I N_{A}) = \\frac{2 N_{A} e^2 I}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T}\n$$\nNow we proceed with the numerical calculation.

A full solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand the limits of the mean-field approximation in electrolytes. This approximation, which underpins the Debye-Hückel theory and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, is valid when the electrostatic potential energy of interaction between ions is small compared to their kinetic energy, which is of the order of the thermal energy $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$. In this limit, ions behave like a weakly interacting gas, and their spatial distribution can be described by a continuous charge density responding to a mean electrostatic potential.\n\nWe can quantify the strength of electrostatic interactions by comparing the typical Coulomb energy between two neighboring counterions to the thermal energy. The typical distance between counterions in the bulk is the mean interionic spacing, given as $a \\sim n^{-1/3}$. The Coulomb energy between two counterions of charge $ze$ at this separation is $U(a) = (ze)^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon a) = z^2e^2/(4\\pi\\varepsilon a)$.\n\nTo form a dimensionless parameter, we take the ratio of this interaction energy to the thermal energy, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{U(a)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\frac{z^2e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon a k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} $$\nUsing the definition of the Bjerrum length, $l_{B} \\equiv e^{2}/(4\\pi\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$, and the estimate for the interionic spacing, $a \\sim n^{-1/3}$, we can rewrite this parameter as:\n$$ \\Gamma \\sim \\frac{z^2 l_B}{a} \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3} $$\nThis dimensionless quantity $\\Gamma$ is known as the electrostatic coupling parameter.\n-   When $\\Gamma \\ll 1$ (weak coupling), the thermal energy dominates over electrostatic interactions. The ions are weakly correlated, and their discrete nature is not important. Mean-field theories are applicable, and the concept of a single Debye screening length, $\\kappa_D^{-1} = ( \\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}}T / (e^2 \\sum_i n_i z_i^2) )^{1/2}$, is a valid description of electrostatic screening.\n-   When $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$ (strong coupling), electrostatic interactions are comparable to or greater than the thermal energy. The positions of ions become strongly correlated; they can no longer be treated as a continuous, ideal gas-like fluid. The mean-field approximation breaks down. Consequently, the standard Debye length loses its predictive power, and new physical phenomena emerge, driven by these strong correlations.\n\nWith this framework, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In mean-field linear screening, the Debye length remains a valid predictor even when $z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3} \\gg 1$ because screening depends only on the continuum permittivity and not on discrete ionic correlations.**\nThe condition $z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3} \\gg 1$ is precisely the strong coupling condition, $\\Gamma \\gg 1$. In this regime, ion-ion correlations are by definition strong and cannot be neglected. Mean-field theory, which fundamentally ignores these correlations, is therefore invalid. The premise that mean-field theory works because it ignores correlations is a circular and incorrect argument. It is the very neglect of these correlations that causes the theory to fail when they become significant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. A physically motivated strong-coupling parameter can be constructed by comparing a typical ion–ion Coulomb energy at separation $a \\sim n^{-1/3}$ to $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, giving a dimensionless measure $\\Gamma \\sim z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3}$; when $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$, ion–ion correlations invalidate mean-field assumptions and make a single Debye length ill-defined.**\nThis statement correctly outlines the physical reasoning for the breakdown of mean-field theory. It correctly identifies the coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ as the ratio of the characteristic Coulomb energy to the thermal energy, derives its correct functional form $\\Gamma \\sim z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3}$, and correctly states that when $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 1$, the underlying assumptions of mean-field theory are violated due to strong ion-ion correlations. This invalidates the universal applicability of a single Debye length.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Near a highly charged surface, multivalent counterions can form a laterally correlated layer whose fluctuations and bridging produce an effective attraction between like-charged colloids, a phenomenon that cannot be captured by mean-field theories that neglect correlations.**\nThis statement describes a key consequence of strong coupling. Mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory predicts purely repulsive interactions between like-charged surfaces at all separations. However, in the strong coupling regime (high surface charge, multivalent counterions), the counterions condensed near the charged surfaces can exhibit strong lateral correlations, forming a liquid-like or even quasi-2D Wigner crystal-like structure. The correlations between the counterion layers associated with two opposing, like-charged surfaces can give rise to an effective attraction. This is a classic example of a correlation-driven phenomenon that is fundamentally absent from any mean-field level description.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The only mechanism responsible for the breakdown of mean-field screening at high $z$ and $n$ is the dielectric decrement of water; if the permittivity were held constant, Debye screening would remain valid regardless of $z$.**\nThis statement is false. While dielectric decrement (the decrease in the dielectric constant of the solvent at high ion concentrations) is a real effect that contributes to deviations from ideal behavior, it is not the *only* or even the primary mechanism for the breakdown being discussed. The dominant mechanism, especially for multivalent ions ($z > 1$), is the onset of strong electrostatic correlations, as captured by the parameter $\\Gamma \\sim z^2 l_B n^{1/3}$. Even if the permittivity $\\varepsilon$ were assumed to be constant, this parameter can become large, leading to strong coupling and the failure of mean-field theory. The strong dependence on $z^2$ makes this effect particularly pronounced for multivalent ions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For water at $T \\approx 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ with $l_{B} \\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $z=3$, and $n=10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, the estimate $\\Gamma \\sim z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3}$ is of order unity, indicating the onset of strong coupling and the limitations of a unique Debye screening length.**\nThis statement requires a numerical calculation.\nFirst, convert the concentration $n=10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to units of ions per $\\mathrm{nm}^3$.\n$n = 10\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$.\nUsing Avogadro's number $N_A \\approx 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ and the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3$:\n$$ n = 10^{-2}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\,\\text{ions}}{\\mathrm{mol}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3} = 6.022 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{ions/nm}^3 $$\nNext, calculate the mean interionic spacing scale, $n^{-1/3}$:\n$$ n^{1/3} = (6.022 \\times 10^{-3})^{1/3} \\, \\mathrm{nm}^{-1} \\approx 0.1819 \\, \\mathrm{nm}^{-1} $$\nNow, calculate the coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ using the given values $z=3$ and $l_B \\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$ \\Gamma \\sim z^{2}l_{B}n^{1/3} \\approx (3)^2 \\times (0.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times (0.1819\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}) $$\n$$ \\Gamma \\approx 9 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.1819 = 6.3 \\times 0.1819 \\approx 1.146 $$\nThe calculated value $\\Gamma \\approx 1.15$ is indeed of order unity. This signifies that the system is at the verge of or already in the strong coupling regime. The conclusion that this indicates the onset of strong coupling and the associated limitations of the mean-field Debye screening concept is therefore correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2931405"}]}
