The derivation must be based on three specified conditions and a geometric-mean combining hypothesis. Subsequently, this relation is to be used for a numerical calculation and a physical interpretation.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the combining relation for $A_{132}$ in terms of the self-Hamaker constants $A_{11}$, $A_{22}$, and $A_{33}$. The self-Hamaker constants $A_{kk}$ represent the interaction of two bodies of material $k$ across a vacuum. The geometric-mean combining hypothesis, when applied to the underlying frequency-dependent dielectric response functions, motivates an approximate relation of the form:\n$$ A_{132} \\approx (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{22}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}}) $$\nThis relation directly connects the Hamaker constant for a heterogeneous system ($1-3-2$) to the self-Hamaker constants of the constituent materials. We must now validate this proposed relation against the three rigorous conditions stipulated in the problem statement.\n\nCondition 1: Symmetry upon exchange of materials $1$ and $2$.\nThe proposed relation is $A_{132} = (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{22}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})$. If we exchange materials $1$ and $2$, we compute $A_{231}$:\n$$ A_{231} = (\\sqrt{A_{22}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}}) $$\nSince multiplication is commutative, $A_{132} = A_{231}$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nCondition 2: The interaction vanishes when material $1$ or $2$ is identical to the intervening medium $3$.\nIf material $1$ is identical to medium $3$, then their physical properties are identical, and consequently their self-Hamaker constants must be equal: $A_{11} = A_{33}$. Substituting this into the relation gives:\n$$ A_{332} = (\\sqrt{A_{33}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{22}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}}) = (0)(\\sqrt{A_{22}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}}) = 0 $$\nSimilarly, if material $2$ is identical to medium $3$, then $A_{22} = A_{33}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ A_{133} = (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{33}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}}) = (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(0) = 0 $$\nIn both cases, the interaction correctly vanishes, as a material cannot interact with itself across an identical medium. The condition is satisfied.\n\nCondition 3: The relation reduces to the expected self-consistency when $1=2$.\nIf materials $1$ and $2$ are identical, then $A_{11} = A_{22}$, and the system becomes a symmetric interaction of material $1$ across medium $3$. The Hamaker constant for this case is denoted $A_{131}$. Substituting $A_{22} = A_{11}$ into our relation yields:\n$$ A_{131} = (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}}) = (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})^2 $$\nThis is the well-established combining rule for the interaction of two identical bodies across a third medium. It correctly predicts that the interaction vanishes if $A_{11}=A_{33}$ and is always positive otherwise, corresponding to an attractive van der Waals force for symmetric systems (in the absence of retardation effects). The condition is satisfied.\n\nHaving validated the proposed combining relation, we now proceed to the numerical calculation of $A_{132}$ using the provided values:\n- $A_{11} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n- $A_{22} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n- $A_{33} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$ A_{132} = (\\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-20}} - \\sqrt{5.0 \\times 10^{-20}})(\\sqrt{2.0 \\times 10^{-20}} - \\sqrt{5.0 \\times 10^{-20}}) $$\nWe can factor out the $\\sqrt{10^{-20}} = 10^{-10}$ term from each parenthesis:\n$$ A_{132} = [10^{-10}(\\sqrt{8.0} - \\sqrt{5.0})][10^{-10}(\\sqrt{2.0} - \\sqrt{5.0})] $$\n$$ A_{132} = 10^{-20} (\\sqrt{8.0} - \\sqrt{5.0})(\\sqrt{2.0} - \\sqrt{5.0}) $$\nNow we evaluate the numerical factors:\n$$ \\sqrt{8.0} \\approx 2.8284 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{2.0} \\approx 1.4142 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{5.0} \\approx 2.2361 $$\n$$ A_{132} \\approx 10^{-20} (2.8284 - 2.2361)(1.4142 - 2.2361) $$\n$$ A_{132} \\approx 10^{-20} (0.5923)(-0.8219) $$\n$$ A_{132} \\approx -0.48685 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J} $$\nIn standard scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures, this is:\n$$ A_{132} \\approx -4.87 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J} $$\n\nFinally, we must interpret the physical significance of a negative Hamaker constant within the framework of DLVO theory. The DLVO theory describes the total interaction potential, $V_{total}$, between two surfaces as the sum of the van der Waals potential, $V_{vdW}$, and the electrostatic double-layer potential, $V_{EDL}$. For two parallel planar surfaces separated by a distance $D$, the van der Waals interaction energy per unit area, $W_{vdW}$, is given by:\n$$ W_{vdW}(D) = -\\frac{A_{132}}{12\\pi D^2} $$\nIf the Hamaker constant $A_{132}$ is positive, $W_{vdW}(D)$ is negative, which signifies an attractive force. However, our calculation yielded a negative value for $A_{132}$. In this case, the interaction energy becomes:\n$$ W_{vdW}(D) = -\\frac{(-|A_{132}|)}{12\\pi D^2} = +\\frac{|A_{132}|}{12\\pi D^2} > 0 $$\nA positive interaction energy corresponds to a repulsive force. Therefore, a negative Hamaker constant implies a repulsive van der Waals interaction between materials $1$ and $2$ across medium $3$.\n\nFor the specific case of like-charged surfaces, the electrostatic double-layer interaction $V_{EDL}$ is always repulsive. If $A_{132}$ is negative, the van der Waals interaction $V_{vdW}$ is also repulsive. The total DLVO potential is then:\n$$ V_{total}(D) = V_{vdW}(D) + V_{EDL}(D) = (\\text{repulsive}) + (\\text{repulsive}) $$\nThe total interaction is therefore repulsive at all separations $D$. This scenario leads to unconditional colloidal stability, as there is no attractive well at short distances to cause particle aggregation or coagulation.\n\nThe condition for $A_{132}$ to be negative can be deduced from its formula: $A_{132} = (\\sqrt{A_{11}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})(\\sqrt{A_{22}} - \\sqrt{A_{33}})$. The product is negative if and only if the two terms have opposite signs. This occurs when the value of $\\sqrt{A_{33}}$ is intermediate between $\\sqrt{A_{11}}$ and $\\sqrt{A_{22}}$. Squaring these terms, the condition for a repulsive van der Waals interaction is that the Hamaker constant of the intervening medium, $A_{33}$, is intermediate between the Hamaker constants of the interacting bodies, $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}$:\n$$ A_{11}  A_{33}  A_{22} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad A_{22}  A_{33}  A_{11} $$\nThis condition is met by the given numerical values, where $A_{22} (2.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J})  A_{33} (5.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J})  A_{11} (8.0 \\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J})$, which correctly leads to the calculated negative sign for $A_{132}$. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as a \"wetting\" condition, where the medium \"prefers\" to be between the two surfaces more than they prefer to be near each other.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4.87 \\times 10^{-21}}$$", "id": "2912185"}, {"introduction": "Complementing the van der Waals force, the electrostatic double-layer interaction governs repulsion in many colloidal systems.

If this hypothesis is correct, the data should collapse to $y \\approx A_{\\sigma} e^{-x}$.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n1.  **Data Generation and Filtering**: For each case, we have three datasets corresponding to three values of $\\kappa_i$. For each dataset, we generate the force $F_i(h)$ at specified separations $h$. We only consider data points $(h_j, F_j)$ for which the dimensionless separation $\\kappa_i h_j \\ge 2$.\n\n2.  **Least-Squares Fit for Amplitude $A$**: For a given hypothesis, we collect all the retained and rescaled data points $(x_j, y_j)$. We must find the optimal amplitude $A$ for the model $y = A e^{-x}$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S(A) = \\sum_j (y_j - A e^{-x_j})^2$. The minimum is found by setting the derivative $\\frac{dS}{dA}$ to zero:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d S}{d A} = \\sum_j -2e^{-x_j}(y_j - A e^{-x_j}) = 0\n    $$\n    Solving for $A$ yields the expression for the best-fit amplitude:\n    $$\n    A = \\frac{\\sum_j y_j e^{-x_j}}{\\sum_j e^{-2x_j}}\n    $$\n    This calculation must be performed independently for the $\\psi$-scaled data and the $\\sigma$-scaled data, yielding $A_{\\psi}$ and $A_{\\sigma}$.\n\n3.  **Error Calculation**: The goodness-of-fit is quantified by the normalized mean squared deviation $E$:\n    $$\n    E = \\frac{\\sum_j \\left(y_j - A e^{-x_j}\\right)^2}{\\sum_j y_j^2}\n    $$\n    This is computed for both hypotheses, yielding $E_{\\psi}$ and $E_{\\sigma}$.\n\n4.  **Decision**: For each case, we compare the two error metrics. If $E_{\\psi} \\le E_{\\sigma}$, we conclude that the constant potential hypothesis is favored (result is `True`). Otherwise, the constant charge hypothesis is favored (result is `False`).\n\n**Implementation and Results**\nThe procedure described above can be implemented in a programming language such as Python with the NumPy library for numerical calculations.\n\n-   **Case 1**: The force is constructed to be proportional to $\\kappa$, so we expect the constant $\\psi$ hypothesis to yield a much better data collapse and a smaller error $E_{\\psi}$. The calculation confirms $E_{\\psi} \\ll E_{\\sigma}$, so the result is `True`.\n-   **Case 2**: The force is constructed to be proportional to $\\kappa^{-1}$. We expect the constant $\\sigma$ hypothesis to be superior, resulting in $E_{\\sigma} \\ll E_{\\psi}$. The calculation confirms this, so the result is `False`.\n-   **Case 3**: This case is a mixture, but the weighting factor $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{mix}}=0.7$ makes the behavior predominantly constant $\\psi$-like. We expect the constant $\\psi$ scaling to provide a better, though imperfect, collapse. The calculation confirms that $E_{\\psi}  E_{\\sigma}$, so the result is `True`.\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code to reach the conclusion.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_error(points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the best-fit amplitude A and normalized mean squared deviation E.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not points:\n        return float('inf')\n\n    xs = np.array([p[0] for p in points])\n    ys = np.array([p[1] for p in points])\n\n    # Calculate the optimal amplitude A using the least-squares formula\n    exp_neg_x = np.exp(-xs)\n    A_numerator = np.sum(ys * exp_neg_x)\n    A_denominator = np.sum(np.exp(-2.0 * xs))\n    \n    if A_denominator == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    \n    A = A_numerator / A_denominator\n    \n    # Calculate the normalized mean squared deviation E\n    residuals = ys - A * exp_neg_x\n    E_numerator = np.sum(residuals**2)\n    E_denominator = np.sum(ys**2)\n\n    if E_denominator == 0:\n        return 0.0 if E_numerator == 0.0 else float('inf')\n        \n    return E_numerator / E_denominator\n\ndef process_case(case_params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes a single case to determine the favored hypothesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    kappas = case_params[\"kappas\"]\n    hs = case_params[\"hs\"]\n    force_func = case_params[\"force_func\"]\n    \n    psi_points = []\n    sigma_points = []\n    \n    for k in kappas:\n        for h in hs:\n            if k * h >= 2.0:\n                F_h = force_func(h, k)\n                x = k * h\n                \n                y_psi = F_h / k\n                psi_points.append((x, y_psi))\n                \n                y_sigma = k * F_h\n                sigma_points.append((x, y_sigma))\n\n    E_psi = calculate_error(psi_points)\n    E_sigma = calculate_error(sigma_points)\n    \n    # Decide based on the rule: favor psi if E_psi = E_sigma\n    return E_psi = E_sigma\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define test cases, run the analysis, and generate results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case 1\",\n            \"kappas\": [0.10, 0.20, 0.30],\n            \"hs\": [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50],\n            \"force_func\": lambda h, k: 0.2 * k * np.exp(-k * h) * (1 + 0.01 * np.sin(0.1 * h))\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case 2\",\n            \"kappas\": [0.08, 0.16, 0.32],\n            \"hs\": [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50],\n            \"force_func\": lambda h, k: (0.02 / k) * np.exp(-k * h) * (1 + 0.01 * np.cos(0.07 * h))\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Case 3\",\n            \"kappas\": [0.09, 0.18, 0.36],\n            \"hs\": [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50],\n            \"force_func\": lambda h, k: (0.7 * 0.2 * k + 0.3 * 0.02 / k) * np.exp(-k * h) * (1 + 0.005 * np.sin(0.11 * h))\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = process_case(case)\n        results.append(str(result))\n    \n    return f\"[{','.join(results)}]\"\n\n# The final answer is obtained by running the solve function.\n# final_answer = solve()\n```", "answer": "`[True,False,True]`", "id": "2912191"}]}
