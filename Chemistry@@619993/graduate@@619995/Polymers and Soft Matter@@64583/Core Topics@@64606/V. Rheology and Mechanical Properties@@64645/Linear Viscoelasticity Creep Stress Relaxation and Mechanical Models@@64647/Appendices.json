The governing equation is correctly stated. The loading protocols are standard, with the ideal step strain being a common theoretical construct and the ramp-and-hold being its physically realizable counterpart. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with no contradictions or missing information. All terms are standard and clearly defined.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Stress Responses**\n\nThe constitutive equation for the Kelvin-Voigt model is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $$\n\n**Case 1: Ideal Strain Step**\nThe applied strain is $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. The strain rate is the derivative, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}[\\epsilon_0 H(t)] = \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. Substituting these into the constitutive equation gives the stress response:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,(\\epsilon_0 H(t)) + \\eta\\,(\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 H(t) + \\eta\\,\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t) $$\nFor times $t > 0$, $H(t)=1$ and $\\delta(t)=0$. The stress is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 \\quad (\\text{for } t > 0) $$\nThe stress does not relax but remains constant. The delta function term signifies an infinite stress impulse at $t=0$, required to instantaneously strain the dashpot.\n\n**Case 2: Ramp-and-Hold Strain**\nThe strain history is piece-wise. We analyze each piece.\n\n-   **Ramp Phase ($0 \\le t \\le t_r$)**:\n    The strain is $\\epsilon(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t$. The strain rate is constant, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}$.\n    The stress is:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,(\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t) + \\eta\\,(\\dot{\\epsilon}) = E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n\n-   **Hold Phase ($t > t_r$)**:\n    The strain is constant, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0$. The strain rate is zero, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = 0$.\n    The stress is:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = E\\,(\\epsilon_0) + \\eta\\,(0) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 $$\n\n-   **Stress at the transition time $t_r$**:\n    We evaluate the stress at the instant just before $t_r$, denoted $t_r^-$, and just after $t_r$, denoted $t_r^+$.\n    $$ \\sigma(t_r^-) = \\lim_{t \\to t_r^-} (E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}) = E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t_r + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n    Using the definition $t_r = \\epsilon_0 / \\dot{\\epsilon}$, we have $\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t_r = \\epsilon_0$. Thus:\n    $$ \\sigma(t_r^-) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n    The stress immediately after the ramp stops is:\n    $$ \\sigma(t_r^+) = E\\,\\epsilon_0 $$\n    There is a stress drop at $t=t_r$ of magnitude:\n    $$ \\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+) = (E\\,\\epsilon_0 + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}) - E\\,\\epsilon_0 = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon} $$\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under a strain step $\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_0 H(t)$, the total stress is $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0 H(t)+\\eta\\,\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta distribution; thus for $t>0$ the stress is a constant $E\\,\\epsilon_0$, and the impulse at $t=0$ makes a conventional relaxation modulus ill-posed for a true step strain.**\nThis statement is a perfect summary of our derivation for the ideal step strain. The formula for $\\sigma(t)$ is correct. The stress for $t>0$ is indeed constant at $E\\,\\epsilon_0$. The presence of the $\\delta(t)$ term means the relaxation modulus $G(t)=\\sigma(t)/\\epsilon_0$ is not a simple decaying function but contains a distribution, which is problematic for conventional definition and measurement. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under a strain step $\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_0 H(t)$, the stress decays exponentially as $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ with $\\tau=\\eta/E$, exhibiting classical stress relaxation.**\nThis is incorrect. As derived, for $t>0$, the stress is constant at $E\\,\\epsilon_0$. Exponential decay is characteristic of the Maxwell model in a stress relaxation test, not the Kelvin-Voigt model. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Under a linear strain ramp $\\epsilon(t)=\\dot{\\epsilon}\\, t$ for $0<t<t_r$ followed by a hold for $t\\ge t_r$, the stress response is $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t+\\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ for $0<t<t_r$ and $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0$ for $t\\ge t_r$.**\nOur derivation yielded $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\\,t+\\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ for the ramp phase and $\\sigma(t)=E\\,\\epsilon_0$ for the hold phase. The description in this option is in exact agreement with our findings. The function describing stress for $t \\ge t_r$ is $\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_0$, so it holds at $t=t_r$ as well (being the value from the right, $\\sigma(t_r^+)$). **Correct**.\n\n**D. In the finite ramp test, there is a downward jump in stress at $t=t_r$ of magnitude $\\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ as $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ drops from $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ to $0$, which can be used to estimate $\\eta$.**\nOur analysis showed that the stress drop at $t=t_r$ is $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+) = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$. This is a downward jump caused by the abrupt cessation of strain rate. Since the magnitude of the drop is directly proportional to $\\eta$ (with $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ being a known experimental parameter), measuring this drop allows for the calculation of $\\eta$. **Correct**.\n\n**E. In the hold segment of the finite ramp test ($t\\ge t_r$), the stress relaxes exponentially to zero; fitting this decay yields $\\eta$.**\nThis is incorrect. Our derivation for the hold segment ($t > t_r$) shows that the stress is constant, $\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon_0$. There is no relaxation or decay of any kind. The stress associated with the viscous element disappears instantly when the strain rate becomes zero. **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. From a single finite ramp test with known $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, the parameters can be extracted via $E=\\sigma(t_r^+)/\\epsilon_0$ and $\\eta=\\big(\\sigma(t_r^-)-\\sigma(t_r^+)\\big)/\\dot{\\epsilon}$, where $t_r^\\pm$ denote instants immediately before and after $t_r$.**\nFrom our analysis, the stress immediately after the ramp stops is $\\sigma(t_r^+) = E\\,\\epsilon_0$. Rearranging gives $E = \\sigma(t_r^+)/\\epsilon_0$, which matches the first formula.\nThe stress drop is $\\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+) = \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$. Rearranging gives $\\eta = (\\sigma(t_r^-) - \\sigma(t_r^+))/\\dot{\\epsilon}$, which matches the second formula. Both expressions are correct and provide a direct method for parameter extraction. **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "2919060"}, {"introduction": "While simple models have their place, describing the rich behavior of polymers often requires more complex representations.

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe mechanical model described is a set of elements connected in parallel. For a parallel arrangement, the total shear stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the sum of the stresses in each of the parallel branches, while the shear strain $\\gamma(t)$ is identical for all branches. The model consists of an ideal spring (branch $\\infty$) and three Maxwell branches (branches $i=1, 2, 3$).\nThe total stress is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\infty}(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_i(t)\n$$\nWe must determine the stress response $\\sigma_{\\infty}(t)$ and $\\sigma_i(t)$ for the imposed step strain $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_0 H(t)$.\n\nFirst, consider the ideal spring with modulus $G_{\\infty}$. The constitutive relation is $\\sigma = G \\gamma$. For the given strain history, the stress in this branch is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\infty}(t) = G_{\\infty} \\gamma(t) = G_{\\infty} \\gamma_0 H(t)\n$$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, $H(t)=1$, so $\\sigma_{\\infty}(t) = G_{\\infty} \\gamma_0$.\n\nNext, consider a single Maxwell branch $i$, which consists of an ideal spring with modulus $G_i$ and a Newtonian dashpot with viscosity $\\eta_i$ connected in series.\nFor a series connection, the stresses in the two elements are equal to the stress in the branch, $\\sigma_i$, and the total strain of the branch, $\\gamma$, is the sum of the strains on the spring, $\\gamma_{s,i}$, and the dashpot, $\\gamma_{d,i}$.\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{s,i}(t) + \\gamma_{d,i}(t)\n$$\nThe constitutive relations for the spring and dashpot are:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(t) = G_i \\gamma_{s,i}(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_i(t) = \\eta_i \\frac{d\\gamma_{d,i}(t)}{dt} = \\eta_i \\dot{\\gamma}_{d,i}(t)\n$$\nTo find the governing differential equation for the branch, we differentiate the strain summation with respect to time:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,i}(t) + \\dot{\\gamma}_{d,i}(t)\n$$\nFrom the constitutive relations, we express the strain rates in terms of the stress $\\sigma_i(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,i}(t) = \\frac{1}{G_i} \\dot{\\sigma}_i(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{\\gamma}_{d,i}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\eta_i} \\sigma_i(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the derivative of the strain sum gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\frac{1}{G_i} \\dot{\\sigma}_i(t) + \\frac{1}{\\eta_i} \\sigma_i(t)\n$$\nThis is the differential equation relating stress and strain rate for a Maxwell element. We are given the relaxation time $\\tau_i = \\eta_i / G_i$.

The time derivative of the strain is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\gamma_0 \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. The equation for the stress in branch $i$ becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}_i(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_i} \\sigma_i(t) = G_i \\gamma_0 \\delta(t)\n$$\nFor $t > 0$, the right-hand side is zero, so the equation is homogeneous: $\\dot{\\sigma}_i(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_i} \\sigma_i(t) = 0$. The solution to this first-order homogeneous ODE is an exponential decay:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(t) = A_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_i}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } t > 0\n$$\nwhere $A_i$ is a constant of integration. To determine $A_i$, we integrate the full inhomogeneous ODE across $t=0$ over an infinitesimal interval $[0^-, 0^+]$:\n$$\n\\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\dot{\\sigma}_i(t) dt + \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\frac{1}{\\tau_i} \\sigma_i(t) dt = \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} G_i \\gamma_0 \\delta(t) dt\n$$\nThe first term gives $\\sigma_i(0^+) - \\sigma_i(0^-)$. The second term is zero as the integration interval tends to zero (assuming $\\sigma_i$ is not a delta function itself). The integral on the right-hand side evaluates to $G_i \\gamma_0$. Since the system is at rest before the strain is applied, $\\sigma_i(0^-) = 0$. This yields the initial condition for the stress right after the step:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(0^+) = G_i \\gamma_0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our solution at $t \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(0^+) = A_i \\exp(0) = A_i\n$$\nTherefore, $A_i = G_i \\gamma_0$.

The problem states that the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ is approximated by a Prony series:\n$$\nG(t) \\;\\approx\\; \\sum_{k=1}^{K} G_{k}\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k})\n$$\nWe are given a set of $M$ measurements of the modulus, $\\{G(t_{i})\\}$, at discrete times $\\{t_{i}\\}$ for $i=1, \\dots, M$. For each measurement point, we can write an instance of this approximation:\n$$\nG(t_{i}) \\;\\approx\\; G_{1}\\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{1}) + G_{2}\\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{2}) + \\dots + G_{K}\\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{K})\n$$\nThis represents a system of $M$ linear equations in the $K$ unknown weights $\\{G_{k}\\}$. We can express this system in matrix-vector form. Let $\\mathbf{g} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M}$ be the vector of measured data, where its $i$-th element is $g_{i} = G(t_{i})$. Let $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$ be the vector of unknown weights, where its $k$-th element is $x_{k} = G_{k}$. The system of equations can then be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g} \\approx \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{A}$ is an $M \\times K$ matrix whose entries relate the unknown weights to the measurements. By comparing the matrix equation row by row with the summation for each $t_{i}$, we identify the entries of $\\mathbf{A}$ as:\n$$\nA_{ik} = \\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{k})\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the row index corresponding to the measurement time $t_{i}$, and $k$ is the column index corresponding to the relaxation time $\\tau_{k}$. This completes the first part.\n\nSecond, we are asked to formulate the linear least-squares problem with a nonnegativity constraint. The goal of a least-squares fit is to find the vector of weights $\\mathbf{x}$ that minimizes the discrepancy between the model prediction $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}$ and the measured data $\\mathbf{g}$. This discrepancy is quantified by the squared Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}$. The objective function to minimize is therefore $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2}$. Additionally, the problem specifies that the weights must be nonnegative, $G_{k} \\ge 0$, a constraint which stems from physical principles (thermodynamic admissibility). In vector notation, this is $\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$, where the inequality is understood element-wise. Combining the objective and the constraint gives the formal definition of the non-negative least-squares (NNLS) optimization problem:\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathbf{x}}{\\text{minimize}} \\quad \\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis completes the second part.\n\nThird, we must solve this problem for a specific dataset. The parameters are:\nNumber of relaxation modes, $K=2$.\nRelaxation times, $\\tau_{1}=1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\tau_{2}=2\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nNumber of data points, $M=3$.\nThe data points $(t_{i}, G(t_{i}))$ are:\n$(t_{1}, g_{1}) = (0\\,\\mathrm{s}, 4\\,\\mathrm{kPa})$\n$(t_{2}, g_{2}) = (2\\ln 2\\,\\mathrm{s}, \\frac{5}{4}\\,\\mathrm{kPa})$\n$(t_{3}, g_{3}) = (2\\ln 3\\,\\mathrm{s}, \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\mathrm{kPa})$\n\nThe vector of unknown weights is $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} G_{1} \\\\ G_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$. The vector of measurements is $\\mathbf{g} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5/4 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe construct the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with entries $A_{ik} = \\exp(-t_{i}/\\tau_{k})$:\n$A_{11} = \\exp(-t_{1}/\\tau_{1}) = \\exp(-0/1) = 1$\n$A_{12} = \\exp(-t_{1}/\\tau_{2}) = \\exp(-0/2) = 1$\n$A_{21} = \\exp(-t_{2}/\\tau_{1}) = \\exp(-(2\\ln 2)/1) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-2})) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$A_{22} = \\exp(-t_{2}/\\tau_{2}) = \\exp(-(2\\ln 2)/2) = \\exp(-\\ln 2) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$A_{31} = \\exp(-t_{3}/\\tau_{1}) = \\exp(-(2\\ln 3)/1) = \\exp(\\ln(3^{-2})) = \\frac{1}{9}$\n$A_{32} = \\exp(-t_{3}/\\tau_{2}) = \\exp(-(2\\ln 3)/2) = \\exp(-\\ln 3) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1/4 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/9 & 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem is to find $G_{1} \\ge 0$ and $G_{2} \\ge 0$ that minimize $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2}$.\nThe objective function $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2}$ is a sum of squares and thus is always non-negative. Its minimum value is $0$. This minimum is achieved if and only if the system of linear equations $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{g}$ is consistent, meaning it has an exact solution. Since this is an overdetermined system ($M=3 > K=2$), an exact solution is not guaranteed. However, we must check for this possibility first.\nThe system of equations is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nG_{1} + G_{2} = 4 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}G_{2} = \\frac{5}{4} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{9}G_{1} + \\frac{1}{3}G_{2} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nLet us solve the first two equations. From the first equation, we express $G_{2}$ in terms of $G_{1}$: $G_{2} = 4 - G_{1}$.\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}(4 - G_{1}) = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} + 2 - \\frac{1}{2}G_{1} = \\frac{5}{4}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{4}G_{1} = \\frac{5}{4} - 2 = \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{8}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThis gives $G_{1} = 3$.\nConsequently, $G_{2} = 4 - G_{1} = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\nNow, we must verify if this solution, $(G_{1}, G_{2}) = (3, 1)$, satisfies the third equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{9}(3) + \\frac{1}{3}(1) = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe third equation is satisfied exactly. This means that the system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{g}$ is consistent and has the unique exact solution $G_{1}=3$ and $G_{2}=1$.\nFor this solution, the residual norm is $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{g}\\|_{2}^{2} = 0$, which is the absolute minimum of the least-squares objective function.\nFinally, we check the nonnegativity constraint: $G_{1}=3 > 0$ and $G_{2}=1 > 0$. The constraints are satisfied.\nTherefore, the solution to the unconstrained least-squares problem is also the unique solution to the non-negative least-squares problem. The final weights are $G_{1}=3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ and $G_{2}=1\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2918996"}]}
