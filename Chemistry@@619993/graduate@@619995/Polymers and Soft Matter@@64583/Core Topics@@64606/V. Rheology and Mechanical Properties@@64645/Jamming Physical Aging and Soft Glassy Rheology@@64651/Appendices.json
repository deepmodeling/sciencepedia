Superposition means that these curves can be shifted horizontally along the $\\log t$ axis to collapse onto a single master curve.\n\nLet us choose a reference waiting time $t_{w0}$. The corresponding relaxation curve is the master curve, $G_{master}(t) = G(t, t_{w0}) = F(t/t_{w0}^{\\mu})$. A curve measured at a different waiting time $t_w$ is given by $G(t, t_w) = F(t/t_w^{\\mu})$.\nTo superpose the curve at $t_w$ onto the reference curve at $t_{w0}$, we must find a horizontal shift factor $a(t_w; t_{w0})$ such that when we rescale the time axis for the $t_w$ data by this factor, it matches the master curve. That is, we require the following equality to hold for all measurement times $t$:\n$$\nG(t, t_w) = G_{master}\\left(\\frac{t}{a(t_w; t_{w0})}\\right) = G\\left(\\frac{t}{a(t_w; t_{w0})}, t_{w0}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the functional form derived in part 1):\n$$\nF\\left(\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}}\\right) = F\\left(\\frac{t/a(t_w; t_{w0})}{t_{w0}^{\\mu}}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $F$ is a non-trivial function, this equality requires that its arguments are identical:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}} = \\frac{t}{a(t_w; t_{w0}) \\cdot t_{w0}^{\\mu}}\n$$\nSolving for the shift factor $a(t_w; t_{w0})$ yields:\n$$\na(t_w; t_{w0}) = \\frac{t_w^{\\mu}}{t_{w0}^{\\mu}} = \\left(\\frac{t_w}{t_{w0}}\\right)^{\\mu}\n$$\nThis is the scaling law for the horizontal shift factor.
