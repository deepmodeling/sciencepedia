The flow is in the creeping flow regime.\nThe calculated Weissenberg number, $Wi = 10.0$, is substantially greater than $1$. This signifies that elastic forces are dominant over viscous forces, placing the flow in a strongly elastic, non-Newtonian regime.\nGiven that inertial forces are negligible compared to viscous forces ($Re \\ll 1$), and viscous forces are in turn much smaller than elastic forces ($Wi \\gg 1$), it follows logically that inertial forces are also negligible when compared to elastic forces.
