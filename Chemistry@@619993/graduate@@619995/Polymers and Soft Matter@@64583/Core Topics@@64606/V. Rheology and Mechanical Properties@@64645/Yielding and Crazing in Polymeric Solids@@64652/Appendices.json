Derivation of Craze Initiation Stress ($\\sigma_c$):\n    The craze initiation criterion is given: crazing starts when the magnitude of the hydrostatic tension reaches a critical value $p_c > 0$. Hydrostatic tension is the negative of hydrostatic pressure, let us denote it $p_{tension} = -p$.\n    The criterion is thus $|p_{tension}| = p_c$, which is $|-p| = p_c$.\n    From our calculation, $p = -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma$. Therefore, $-p = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma$. Since $\\sigma > 0$, $-p$ is positive, and its magnitude is simply $-p$.\n    The condition for craze initiation is:\n    $$\n    -p = p_c\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for $p$ in terms of the applied uniaxial stress $\\sigma$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma = p_c\n    $$\n    The problem asks for the uniaxial tensile stress at craze initiation, which we denote as $\\sigma_c$. Replacing $\\sigma$ with $\\sigma_c$ at the point of initiation gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_c = p_c\n    $$\n    Solving for $\\sigma_c$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_c = 3 p_c\n    $$\n    This result shows that the critical tensile stress required to initiate crazing is three times the critical hydrostatic tension the material can withstand.\n\nThe final results are compiled into a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma & \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma & -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma & -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma & \\sigma & -\\frac{1}{3} & 3 p_{c} \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2937956"}, {"introduction": "With the tools to decompose stress, we can begin to test mathematical models that predict the onset of yielding.

It represents a standard analysis in the mechanics of materials.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe hypothesis to be tested is that yielding is governed by a pressure-insensitive $J_2$ criterion. This is also known as the von Mises yield criterion. The criterion states that yielding occurs when the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_2$, reaches a critical value, $k^2$, where $k$ is the yield stress in pure shear.\n$$J_2 = k^2$$\nEquivalently, using the definition of the von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{3J_2}$, the criterion can be stated as yielding occurs when $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ reaches a material constant, the uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_y$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sigma_y$$\nCrucially, for a \"pressure-insensitive\" criterion, this value $\\sigma_y$ must be constant, independent of the stress state, and in particular, independent of the hydrostatic pressure, $p = -\\sigma_m$.\n\nLet us calculate the relevant quantities for the two given test cases.\n\nCase 1: Simple Uniaxial Tension at Yield\nThe stress tensor, in a coordinate system aligned with the loading axis, is:\n$$[\\sigma^{(t)}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_y^{(t)} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_y^{(t)}$, $\\sigma_2 = 0$, and $\\sigma_3 = 0$.\nThe mean stress is $\\sigma_m^{(t)} = (\\sigma_y^{(t)} + 0 + 0)/3 = \\sigma_y^{(t)}/3$.\nThe hydrostatic pressure is $p^{(t)} = -\\sigma_m^{(t)} = -\\sigma_y^{(t)}/3$.\nThe deviatoric stress tensor is:\n$$[s^{(t)}] = [\\sigma^{(t)}] - \\sigma_m^{(t)}[I] = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\sigma_y^{(t)}/3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\sigma_y^{(t)}/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\sigma_y^{(t)}/3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress is:\n$$J_2^{(t)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2\\sigma_y^{(t)}}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_y^{(t)}}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_y^{(t)}}{3}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} \\right] (\\sigma_y^{(t)})^2 = \\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_y^{(t)})^2$$\nThe von Mises equivalent stress is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(t)} = \\sqrt{3J_2^{(t)}} = \\sqrt{3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_y^{(t)})^2} = \\sqrt{(\\sigma_y^{(t)})^2} = |\\sigma_y^{(t)}|$$\nGiven $\\sigma_y^{(t)} = +50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, we have $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(t)} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $p^{(t)} = -50/3\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx -16.7\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nCase 2: Simple Uniaxial Compression at Yield\nThe stress tensor is:\n$$[\\sigma^{(c)}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_y^{(c)} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe derivation is formally identical. The von Mises equivalent stress is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(c)} = |\\sigma_y^{(c)}|$$\nGiven $\\sigma_y^{(c)} = -120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, we have $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(c)} = |-120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}| = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nThe hydrostatic pressure is $p^{(c)} = -\\sigma_y^{(c)}/3 = -(-120)/3\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = +40\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nNow, we test the hypothesis. If the pressure-insensitive $J_2$ criterion holds, then the von Mises equivalent stress at yield must be the same in both tests: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(t)} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(c)}$.\nFrom the data:\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(t)} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(c)} = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\nClearly, $50\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\neq 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The difference is $70\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, which is vastly larger than the combined experimental uncertainty of $2\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + 3\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nTherefore, the hypothesis is decisively falsified by the experimental data. The data show that the yield behavior is strongly dependent on pressure: the material is stronger (higher $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ at yield) under hydrostatic compression ($p > 0$) than under hydrostatic tension ($p < 0$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. Under a pressure-insensitive $J_2$ criterion, simple uniaxial tension and compression at the same temperature and rate must have identical von Mises equivalent yield stress. Because in uniaxial loading $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}=|\\sigma|$, the observed inequality $|\\sigma_y^{(t)}|\\neq|\\sigma_y^{(c)}|$ by much more than the combined experimental uncertainty falsifies the hypothesis.\nThis statement accurately summarises the logic and conclusion of the derivation above. The premise that a $J_2$ criterion requires $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ to be constant is correct. The calculation that $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = |\\sigma|$ for uniaxial stress is correct. The comparison $|\\sigma_y^{(t)}| = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ versus $|\\sigma_y^{(c)}| = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and the conclusion that their inequality falsifies the hypothesis is also correct. The consideration of experimental uncertainty reinforces the conclusion.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The hydrostatic pressure $p$ at yield differs in sign between tension and compression, so the mere fact that $p_t<0$ and $p_c>0$ already falsifies pressure-insensitive $J_2$ yielding, regardless of the magnitudes of the yield stresses.\nThis reasoning is fundamentally flawed. A pressure-insensitive criterion means yield is *independent* of pressure. To test for this independence, one *must* perform experiments at different pressures. The fact that uniaxial tension and compression inherently generate different hydrostatic pressures ($p^{(t)} \\approx -16.7\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $p^{(c)} = +40\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$) provides the necessary condition to test the hypothesis. If the criterion were valid, we would find $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(t)} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(c)}$ *despite* the fact that $p^{(t)} \\neq p^{(c)}$. The difference in pressure is the independent variable in the conceptual experiment, not a source of falsification in itself.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Construct the two $(p,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})$ yield points using $p=-\\sigma/3$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}=|\\sigma|$. Regress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ on $p$ with a linear model $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}=\\sigma_0+\\alpha p$. A statistically significant nonzero slope $\\alpha$ implies pressure sensitivity and falsifies pressure-insensitive $J_2$ yielding. With the given data, the slope is positive and far from zero within the uncertainties.\nThis statement describes a valid and standard method for analyzing pressure-dependent yield criteria (such as the Drucker-Prager criterion, of which this is a linear form). The pressure-insensitive $J_2$ criterion is the special case where the pressure-sensitivity coefficient $\\alpha$ is zero. We have two data points in the $(p, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})$ plane: $(-16.7\\,\\mathrm{MPa}, 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$ for tension and $(40\\,\\mathrm{MPa}, 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$ for compression. A line connecting these points has a slope $\\alpha = \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} / \\Delta p = (120-50)/(40 - (-50/3)) = 70/(170/3) \\approx 1.24$. This slope is clearly positive and significantly different from zero, given the small input uncertainties. Therefore, this method correctly falsifies the pressure-insensitive hypothesis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Because the Lode parameter differs between uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression, pressure insensitivity cannot be evaluated from these two tests; therefore no falsification is possible from these data.\nThe Lode parameter, or Lode angle, characterizes the \"shape\" of the stress state on the deviatoric plane and depends on the third invariant of deviatoric stress, $J_3$. It is true that the Lode parameter is different for uniaxial tension ($\\xi = 1$) and uniaxial compression ($\\xi = -1$). However, the hypothesis under consideration is the pressure-insensitive **$J_2$** criterion, which by definition posits that yielding depends *only* on $J_2$, and not on pressure ($p$, related to the first stress invariant $I_1$) nor on the Lode parameter (related to $J_3$). The fact that the Lode parameter differs is irrelevant to testing a pure $J_2$ theory. In fact, the data are perfectly suitable for testing the pressure sensitivity, as shown in the analyses for options A and C.

Since $\\sigma_{t} = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa} > 0$, we have $\\sigma_{e,t} = \\sigma_{t}$.\nSubstituting into the yield condition $f = \\sigma_{e} + \\alpha p - k = 0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{t} + \\alpha \\frac{\\sigma_{t}}{3} - k = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n\nFor uniaxial compression, the stress tensor in principal components is $(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}, \\sigma_{3}) = (-\\sigma_{c}, 0, 0)$, following the sign convention that tensile stress is positive.\nThe mean stress is $p_{c} = \\frac{-\\sigma_{c} + 0 + 0}{3} = -\\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{3}$.\nThe von Mises equivalent stress is $\\sigma_{e,c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(-\\sigma_{c}-0)^{2} + (0-0)^{2} + (0-(-\\sigma_{c}))^{2}}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(-\\sigma_{c})^{2} + \\sigma_{c}^{2}}{2}} = |\\sigma_{c}|$. Since $\\sigma_{c} = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa} > 0$, we have $\\sigma_{e,c} = \\sigma_{c}$.\nSubstituting into the yield condition:\n$$ \\sigma_{c} - \\alpha \\frac{\\sigma_{c}}{3} - k = 0 \\quad (2) $$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $k$:\nFrom (1): $k = \\sigma_{t} (1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{3})$\nFrom (2): $k = \\sigma_{c} (1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3})$\n\nEquating the expressions for $k$:\n$$ \\sigma_{t} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\right) = \\sigma_{c} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{t} + \\frac{\\alpha\\sigma_{t}}{3} = \\sigma_{c} - \\frac{\\alpha\\sigma_{c}}{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{3} (\\sigma_{t} + \\sigma_{c}) = \\sigma_{c} - \\sigma_{t} $$\n$$ \\alpha = 3 \\frac{\\sigma_{c} - \\sigma_{t}}{\\sigma_{c} + \\sigma_{t}} $$\nSubstitute the given values $\\sigma_{t} = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma_{c} = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$$ \\alpha = 3 \\frac{100 - 60}{100 + 60} = 3 \\frac{40}{160} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.75 $$\nNow, we solve for $k$ using equation (2):\n$$ k = \\sigma_{c} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\right) = 100 \\left(1 - \\frac{0.75}{3}\\right) = 100 (1 - 0.25) = 100 \\times 0.75 = 75\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nSo, the calibrated DP yield condition is $\\sigma_{e} + 0.75 p - 75 = 0$.\n\nNext, we consider the specified biaxial stress state subject to proportional loading. The stress state at yield is $(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}, \\sigma_{3}) = (\\lambda_{y} \\cdot 30, \\lambda_{y} \\cdot 15, 0)$, where all stress values are in MPa.\nWe calculate the mean stress $p$ and von Mises stress $\\sigma_{e}$ for this state in terms of $\\lambda_{y}$.\nThe mean stress is:\n$$ p = \\frac{\\lambda_{y} \\cdot 30 + \\lambda_{y} \\cdot 15 + 0}{3} = \\frac{45 \\lambda_{y}}{3} = 15 \\lambda_{y} $$\nThe von Mises stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\lambda_{y} \\cdot 30 - \\lambda_{y} \\cdot 15)^{2} + (\\lambda_{y} \\cdot 15 - 0)^{2} + (0 - \\lambda_{y} \\cdot 30)^{2}}{2}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{e} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(15 \\lambda_{y})^{2} + (15 \\lambda_{y})^{2} + (-30 \\lambda_{y})^{2}}{2}} $$\nSince $\\lambda_{y} > 0$, we can factor it out of the square root:\n$$ \\sigma_{e} = \\lambda_{y} \\sqrt{\\frac{15^{2} + 15^{2} + (-30)^{2}}{2}} = \\lambda_{y} \\sqrt{\\frac{225 + 225 + 900}{2}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{e} = \\lambda_{y} \\sqrt{\\frac{1350}{2}} = \\lambda_{y} \\sqrt{675} $$\nTo simplify $\\sqrt{675}$: $675 = 225 \\times 3 = 15^{2} \\times 3$. Thus, $\\sqrt{675} = 15\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo, $\\sigma_{e} = 15\\sqrt{3} \\lambda_{y}$.\n\nNow, substitute these expressions for $p$ and $\\sigma_{e}$ into the calibrated yield condition $f=0$:\n$$ (15\\sqrt{3} \\lambda_{y}) + 0.75 (15 \\lambda_{y}) - 75 = 0 $$\nFactor out $\\lambda_{y}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{y} (15\\sqrt{3} + 0.75 \\times 15) = 75 $$\n$$ \\lambda_{y} (15\\sqrt{3} + 11.25) = 75 $$\nDivide by $15$:\n$$ \\lambda_{y} (\\sqrt{3} + 0.75) = 5 $$\nSolve for $\\lambda_{y}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{y} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3} + 0.75} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value. Using $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$:\n$$ \\lambda_{y} = \\frac{5}{1.73205 + 0.75} = \\frac{5}{2.48205} \\approx 2.01446 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain $\\lambda_{y} = 2.014$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.014}$$", "id": "2937907"}]}
