The theory predicts that $G^*_{\\text{app}}$ will be gap-dependent. Specifically, since the derivative $\\dfrac{d}{dh}\\left(\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}\\right) = \\dfrac{2b}{(h+2b)^2} > 0$ for $b>0$, the apparent modulus $|G^*_{\\text{app}}|$ will increase as $h$ increases. In the limit $h \\to \\infty$, $G^*_{\\text{app}} \\to G^*$, giving a gap-independent value, which is the true modulus.\n    -   **Correction**: For correction, one can fit the experimental data of $G^*_{\\text{app}}(h)$ vs. $h$ to the model $G^*_{\\text{app}} = G^* \\dfrac{h}{h+2b}$ using non-linear regression to find the two complex/real parameters $G^*(\\omega)$ and $b$.\n    Alternatively, for a linear fit, one can rearrange the equation:\n    $$\n    \\dfrac{1}{G^*_{\\text{app}}(h)} = \\dfrac{h+2b}{h} \\dfrac{1}{G^*} = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{2b}{h}\\right)\\dfrac{1}{G^*} = \\dfrac{1}{G^*} + \\dfrac{2b}{G^*} \\dfrac{1}{h}\n    $$\n    A plot of $1/G^*_{\\text{app}}$ versus $1/h$ should yield a straight line. The intercept at $1/h = 0$ gives $1/G^*$, from which the true modulus $G^*$ can be recovered. The slope gives $2b/G^*$, allowing for the calculation of the slip length $b$.\n\n    For the case of exactly two measurement points ($h_1, G^*_{\\text{app},1}$ and $h_2, G^*_{\\text{app},2}$), we can solve the system of two equations:\n    $$G^*_{\\text{app},1} = G^*\\,\\dfrac{h_1}{h_1+2b}$$\n    $$G^*_{\\text{app},2} = G^*\\,\\dfrac{h_2}{h_2+2b}$$\n    Solving for $G^*$ from the first equation gives $G^* = G^*_{\\text{app},1}\\left(\\dfrac{h_1+2b}{h_1}\\right) = G^*_{\\text{app},1}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{2b}{h_1}\\right)$.\n    Substituting this into the second equation and solving for $b$ gives $b = \\dfrac{G^*_{\\mathrm{app},2} - G^*_{\\mathrm{app},1}}{2\\left(G^*_{\\mathrm{app},1}/h_1 - G^*_{\\mathrm{app},2}/h_2\\right)}$. These algebraic manipulations are straightforward and correct.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A**: This option states that $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\omega,h) = G^*(\\omega)\\,\\dfrac{h}{h+2b}$, leading to identical scaling for $G'_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and $G''_{\\mathrm{app}}$ with no phase shift. It correctly describes the detection protocol by varying $h$ and observing an increase in $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}$ with $h$. It proposes a valid correction scheme by fitting to the derived relationship. Finally, it provides the correct algebraic solution for the two-point measurement case. Every part of this option is consistent with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Option B**: This option claims that slip is an \"interfacial elastic effect\" that suppresses $G'_{\\mathrm{app}}$ more than $G''_{\\mathrm{app}}$. This is incorrect. The Navier slip model as given is purely dissipative ($v \\propto \\dot{\\gamma}$), not elastic. Our derivation shows that the scaling factor is real, meaning $G'$ and $G''$ are affected proportionally, and the loss tangent is unchanged. The proposed correction method of only adjusting $G'_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is therefore baseless.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option C**: This option states that $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}$ increases as $h$ decreases, which is the opposite of our derived result. The functional form it proposes, $G^*_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\omega,h) = G^*(\\omega)\\left(1 + \\dfrac{2b}{h}\\right)$, is incorrect; this resembles the form for $1/G^*_{\\text{app}}$, not $G^*_{\\text{app}}$. It wrongly suggests extrapolating to $h \\to 0$, which would give a meaningless result $G^*_{\\text{app}} \\to 0$, not the true modulus.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option D**: This option incorrectly claims that the apparent moduli are independent of $h$ and instead depend on $R$. Our derivation shows a definitive dependence on $h$. The slip effect, as modeled, is governed by the ratio of slip length to gap height, $b/h$, not the plate radius $R$. While $R$ is part of the overall modulus calculation, it does not govern the slip artifact described. The proposed detection and correction method based on varying $R$ is therefore inappropriate for this model of slip.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2912764"}]}
