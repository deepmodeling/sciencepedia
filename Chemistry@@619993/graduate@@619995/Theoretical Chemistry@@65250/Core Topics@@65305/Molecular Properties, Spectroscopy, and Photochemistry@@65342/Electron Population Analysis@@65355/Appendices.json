Also, briefly explain in your working how increasing $s$ affects the magnitude and sign of $q_{A}(s)$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is a well-posed exercise in elementary quantum chemistry and is scientifically sound. It is self-contained, consistent, and all terms are formally defined. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Mulliken net atomic charge on atom $\\mathrm{A}$, denoted $q_{A}(s)$, as a function of the atomic orbital (AO) overlap parameter $s$. The charge is defined as $q_{A}(s) = Z_{A} - G_{A}(s)$, where $Z_{A}$ is the nuclear charge of atom $\\mathrm{A}$ and $G_{A}(s)$ is its Mulliken gross atomic population. We are given $Z_{A}=1$. The derivation must begin from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we must determine the normalized molecular orbital (MO) coefficient vector, $c$. We are given an unnormalized vector $d = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the overlap matrix $S(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s \\\\ s & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The normalization condition for the MO coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis is $c^{\\mathrm{T}} S c = 1$. The normalized vector $c$ is obtained from $d$ by:\n$$\nc = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{d^{\\mathrm{T}} S(s) d}}\n$$\nWe compute the normalization factor in the denominator. The transpose of $d$ is $d^{\\mathrm{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The quadratic form $d^{\\mathrm{T}} S(s) d$ is:\n$$\nd^{\\mathrm{T}} S(s) d = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s \\\\ s & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot s & 2 \\cdot s + 1 \\cdot 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2+s & 2s+1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nd^{\\mathrm{T}} S(s) d = 2(2+s) + 1(2s+1) = 4 + 2s + 2s + 1 = 4s + 5\n$$\nThe normalization constant is therefore $\\sqrt{4s+5}$. The normalized coefficient vector is:\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4s+5}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A} \\\\ c_{B} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $c_{A} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{4s+5}}$ and $c_{B} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4s+5}}$.\n\nNext, we construct the density matrix $P(s)$ for the two-electron closed-shell system where the single MO $\\phi$ is doubly occupied. The formula given is $P(s) = 2 c c^{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n$$\nP(s) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4s+5}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4s+5}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{2}{4s+5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nP(s) = \\frac{2}{4s+5} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{8}{4s+5} & \\frac{4}{4s+5} \\\\ \\frac{4}{4s+5} & \\frac{2}{4s+5} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe elements are $P_{AA} = \\frac{8}{4s+5}$, $P_{BB} = \\frac{2}{4s+5}$, and $P_{AB} = P_{BA} = \\frac{4}{4s+5}$.\n\nThe Mulliken population analysis partitions the total number of electrons, $N_e$, among the atoms. The total electron density is given by $\\sum_{\\mu,\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu} \\chi_\\mu \\chi_\\nu$. The total number of electrons is found by integrating this density over all space:\n$$\nN_e = \\int \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu} \\chi_\\mu \\chi_\\nu \\, d\\tau = \\sum_{\\mu,\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu} S_{\\mu\\nu} = \\mathrm{Tr}(PS)\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\mu\\nu} = \\int \\chi_\\mu \\chi_\\nu \\, d\\tau$ are the elements of the overlap matrix. The term $P_{\\mu\\mu}S_{\\mu\\mu}$ is the net population in orbital $\\chi_\\mu$, and $2 P_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu}$ (for $\\mu \\ne \\nu$) is the overlap population between $\\chi_\\mu$ and $\\chi_\\nu$. Mulliken's scheme assigns the net population $P_{\\mu\\mu}S_{\\mu\\mu}$ entirely to the atom on which $\\chi_\\mu$ is centered, and divides the overlap population equally between the two atoms involved. The gross atomic population for atom A, $G_A$, is the sum of populations for all AOs on atom A. In this minimal basis, only $\\chi_A$ is on atom A. Thus, $G_A$ is the net population in $\\chi_A$ plus half of the overlap population between $\\chi_A$ and $\\chi_B$:\n$$\nG_{A}(s) = P_{AA}S_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2} (2 P_{AB}S_{AB}) = P_{AA}S_{AA} + P_{AB}S_{AB}\n$$\nThis expression is precisely the diagonal element $(PS)_{AA}$ of the population matrix $PS$:\n$$\n(PS)_{AA} = \\sum_{k \\in \\{A, B\\}} P_{Ak}S_{kA} = P_{AA}S_{AA} + P_{AB}S_{BA}\n$$\nSince the overlap matrix is symmetric ($S_{AB} = S_{BA}$), we have $G_A(s) = (PS)_{AA}$. We now compute the matrix product $P(s)S(s)$:\n$$\nP(s)S(s) = \\frac{2}{4s+5} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s \\\\ s & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{4s+5} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot s & 4 \\cdot s + 2 \\cdot 1 \\\\ 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot s & 2 \\cdot s + 1 \\cdot 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nP(s)S(s) = \\frac{2}{4s+5} \\begin{pmatrix} 4+2s & 4s+2 \\\\ 2+s & 2s+1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe gross population on atom A is the (A,A) element of this matrix:\n$$\nG_{A}(s) = (PS)_{AA} = \\frac{2(4+2s)}{4s+5} = \\frac{8+4s}{4s+5}\n$$\nAs a check, the total number of electrons should be $\\mathrm{Tr}(PS) = G_A + G_B = (PS)_{AA} + (PS)_{BB}$:\n$$\nN_e = \\frac{2(4+2s)}{4s+5} + \\frac{2(2s+1)}{4s+5} = \\frac{8+4s+4s+2}{4s+5} = \\frac{8s+10}{4s+5} = \\frac{2(4s+5)}{4s+5} = 2\n$$\nThis confirms the conservation of the total number of electrons, which is $2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Mulliken net atomic charge on atom A, $q_A(s)$, using the provided nuclear charge $Z_A = 1$:\n$$\nq_{A}(s) = Z_{A} - G_{A}(s) = 1 - \\frac{8+4s}{4s+5}\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nq_{A}(s) = \\frac{(4s+5) - (8+4s)}{4s+5} = \\frac{4s+5-8-4s}{4s+5} = \\frac{-3}{4s+5}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the net charge on atom A.\n\nRegarding the behavior of $q_{A}(s)$ as $s$ increases over the domain $0 \\le s < 1$:\nThe sign of $q_{A}(s) = \\frac{-3}{4s+5}$ is determined by the denominator, $4s+5$. For $s \\ge 0$, the denominator is strictly positive, starting at $5$ for $s=0$. The numerator is a constant $-3$. Therefore, $q_{A}(s)$ is always negative, indicating that atom A carries a net negative charge. This is expected, as the unnormalized MO has a larger coefficient on atom A ($d_A=2$) than on atom B ($d_B=1$), implying the doubly-occupied bonding orbital has greater density contribution from $\\chi_A$.\n\nThe magnitude of the charge is $|q_{A}(s)| = \\frac{3}{4s+5}$. As $s$ increases, the denominator $4s+5$ increases. Consequently, the fraction $\\frac{3}{4s+5}$ decreases. Thus, as the overlap $s$ between the atomic orbitals increases, the magnitude of the net charge on atom A decreases, signifying a delocalization of electronic charge. At $s=0$, the charge is $q_{A}(0) = -3/5 = -0.6$. As $s$ approaches $1$, the charge approaches $q_{A}(1) = -3/(4+5) = -3/9 = -1/3$. The increasing overlap facilitates electron sharing, reducing the degree of ionicity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{-3}{4s+5}}\n$$", "id": "2770773"}, {"introduction": "While Mulliken charges are easy to compute, they suffer from a well-known and severe dependence on the choice of basis set.

The provided matrices are symmetric as required, and the values are physically plausible for a model calculation. No contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises are present. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution shall be provided.\n\nThe tasks will be addressed in the sequence presented.\n\nFirst, we verify that the total number of electrons, given by $N = \\mathrm{Tr}(PS)$, is $4$ in both scenarios. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of the product matrix $PS$.\n\nFor the initial basis (scenario $0$):\nThe matrix product $P^{(0)}S^{(0)}$ is not needed in its entirety; only its diagonal elements are required.\nThe diagonal elements $(P^{(0)}S^{(0)})_{ii} = \\sum_k P_{ik}^{(0)}S_{ki}^{(0)}$ are calculated.

The left hydrogen atom, $H_L$, is associated with the first basis function, $\\chi_L$, so the sum over AOs on $H_L$ involves only the index $\\mu=1$.\n$$\nN_A = \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} \\sum_{\\nu} P_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nFor $A=H_L$, this sum is:\n$$\nN_{H_L} = \\sum_{\\nu} P_{1\\nu}S_{1\\nu} = (PS)_{11}\n$$\nThis quantity is simply the first diagonal element of the $PS$ matrix product, which we have already calculated.\n\nFor scenario $0$:\n$$\nN_{H_L}^{(0)} = (P^{(0)}S^{(0)})_{11} = 0.925\n$$\nThe Mulliken charge is $q_A = Z_A - N_A$. With $Z_H=1$:\n$$\nq_{H_L}^{(0)} = 1 - 0.925 = 0.075\n$$\n\nFor scenario $1$:\n$$\nN_{H_L}^{(1)} = (P^{(1)}S^{(1)})_{11} = 1.1036\n$$\nThe corresponding charge is:\n$$\nq_{H_L}^{(1)} = 1 - 1.1036 = -0.1036\n$$\n\nThird, we explain the significant change in charge on $H_L$. The addition of a single diffuse $s$-function $\\chi_D$ (index $3$) on the central atom $M$ drastically alters the calculated charge on hydrogen from a small positive value ($q_{H_L}^{(0)}=+0.075$) to a significant negative value ($q_{H_L}^{(1)}=-0.1036$). This is a direct consequence of the definition of Mulliken population analysis and the properties of diffuse basis functions.\n\nThe gross population $N_{H_L}$ is the sum of terms $P_{1\\nu}S_{1\\nu}$. Let us analyze the contributions in each case:\nFor scenario $0$: $N_{H_L}^{(0)} = P_{11}^{(0)}S_{11}^{(0)} + P_{12}^{(0)}S_{12}^{(0)} + P_{13}^{(0)}S_{13}^{(0)} = 0.80 + 0.12 + 0.005$.\nFor scenario $1$: $N_{H_L}^{(1)} = P_{11}^{(1)}S_{11}^{(1)} + P_{12}^{(1)}S_{12}^{(1)} + P_{13}^{(1)}S_{13}^{(1)} + P_{14}^{(1)}S_{14}^{(1)} = 0.70 + 0.018 + 0.384 + 0.0016$.\n\nThe critical difference lies in the term involving the new diffuse function $\\chi_D$ (index $3$). The term is $P_{13}^{(1)}S_{13}^{(1)} = (1.20)(0.32) = 0.384$. A diffuse function is spatially very extended, causing it to have a non-negligible overlap $S_{13}^{(1)}=0.32$ with the distant $\\chi_L$ orbital. The electronic structure calculation resulted in a large density matrix element $P_{13}^{(1)}=1.20$, indicating substantial electronic coupling through the basis representation.\n\nThe Mulliken scheme partitions the electron population in an overlap region, $2P_{\\mu\\nu}S_{\\mu\\nu}$, by assigning half to atom A (if $\\mu \\in A$) and half to atom B (if $\\nu \\in B$). In our case, the population $2P_{13}^{(1)}S_{13}^{(1)}$ arises from the overlap between $\\chi_L$ (on $H_L$) and $\\chi_D$ (on $M$). The scheme mechanically assigns half of this population, a value of $P_{13}^{(1)}S_{13}^{(1)} = 0.384$, to $H_L$. This large, positive contribution dramatically increases the calculated gross population $N_{H_L}^{(1)}$, making the hydrogen atom appear electron-rich and thus negatively charged. This is an artifact; the diffuse function on $M$ extends into the region of space around $H_L$, and the Mulliken method incorrectly assigns a large portion of this shared density to the hydrogen atom. This demonstrates the well-known instability and basis-set dependence of Mulliken charges, particularly with diffuse basis functions.\n\nFinally, we report the numerical change in the Mulliken charge on $H_L$, $\\Delta q_{H_L} \\equiv q_{H_L}^{(1)} - q_{H_L}^{(0)}$.\n$$\n\\Delta q_{H_L} = (-0.1036) - (0.075) = -0.1786\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the value remains $-0.1786$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.1786}\n$$", "id": "2770788"}, {"introduction": "To overcome the basis-set dependence of methods like Mulliken analysis, we can turn to schemes that partition the electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ directly in real space.

Convergence is deemed achieved if the number of basins does not change upon grid refinement.\n\nD. Compute $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_j)$ via FFTs as in option A, but define basins by assigning each point to the nearest nucleus in Euclidean distance using the minimum-image convention, thereby avoiding path-following. Integrate $\\rho$ over these Voronoi-like cells to get $N_A$, and set $q_A = Z_A - N_A$. Convergence is checked by ensuring that the difference between these charges and Mulliken charges is below $\\epsilon$ and insensitive to halving $h_\\alpha$.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "We begin from the fundamental definitions and properties relevant to electron population analysis in periodic systems.\n\nThe electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is lattice-periodic, so it admits a Fourier series expansion\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} \\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{G}) e^{i \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{G}$ runs over reciprocal lattice vectors. The gradient follows from term-by-term differentiation,\n$$\n\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} i \\mathbf{G} \\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{G}) e^{i \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}.\n$$\nOn a uniform discrete grid, this operation is implemented via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): compute $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}})$ from $\\rho(\\mathbf{r}_j)$ by a discrete Fourier transform, multiply by $i \\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}$, and inverse FFT to obtain $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_j)$ on all grid points $\\mathbf{r}_j$. The reciprocal vectors on a discrete grid are $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{n_1}{L_1}\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\frac{n_2}{L_2}\\mathbf{b}_2 + \\frac{n_3}{L_3}\\mathbf{b}_3\\right)$ with integers $n_\\alpha$ and reciprocal basis vectors $\\mathbf{b}_\\alpha$ such that $\\mathbf{a}_\\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_\\beta = \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}$.\n\nIn the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) or Bader analysis, basins $\\Omega_A$ are defined as the sets of points whose gradient-ascent trajectories under $\\nabla \\rho$ terminate at a local maximum, typically at a nucleus in an all-electron density. The interbasin boundaries are zero-flux surfaces $S$ satisfying $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_S(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$, and these are recovered discretely by assigning each point to the attractor reached by following $\\nabla \\rho$. In periodic systems, the minimum-image convention must be used when comparing positions or stepping across cell boundaries: any displacement $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}$ between grid points is mapped to the shortest equivalent vector by adding or subtracting lattice vectors so that $\\|\\Delta \\mathbf{r}\\|$ is minimal. This ensures a physically consistent tracing of gradient paths across periodic boundaries.\n\nOnce basins are identified, the electron population associated with atom $A$ is\n$$\nN_A = \\int_{\\Omega_A} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\approx \\sum_{j \\in \\Omega_A} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_j) \\, \\Delta V,\n$$\nwith voxel volume $\\Delta V = V/(N_1 N_2 N_3)$. The Bader charge is then\n$$\nq_A = Z_A - N_A,\n$$\nwhere $Z_A$ denotes the nuclear charge consistent with the number of electrons represented in $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ (e.g., total for all-electron, or valence for pseudopotential valence densities).\n\nConvergence with respect to grid spacing $h_\\alpha = L_\\alpha/N_\\alpha$ must be established by principled checks: a standard requirement is that $|q_A(h) - q_A(h/2)|$ falls below a tolerance $\\epsilon$ upon uniform refinement, and that the sum of basin populations matches the total number of electrons $N_e$ within $\\epsilon$, i.e., $\\left|\\sum_A N_A - N_e\\right| < \\epsilon$. Additionally, a discrete measure of the zero-flux condition should decrease with refinement, for example the sum over inter-voxel faces belonging to different basins of $\\left|\\nabla \\rho \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\right|$ times the face area, which should approach zero as $h_\\alpha \\to 0$. Basin topology (e.g., number of basins and their connectivity) should also stabilize.\n\nWe now analyze each option.\n\nOption A: This option uses the FFT property of derivatives in reciprocal space, multiplying $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}})$ by $i \\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}}$ and inverse transforming to obtain $\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_j)$, which follows directly from $\\nabla e^{i \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} = i \\mathbf{G} e^{i \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$. It defines basins by steepest-ascent to density maxima, which matches the Bader definition. It correctly applies the minimum-image convention for neighbor decisions across periodic boundaries. It integrates $\\rho$ over basin voxels to obtain $N_A$ with $\\Delta V = V/(N_1 N_2 N_3)$ and defines $q_A = Z_A - N_A$, which is standard. The convergence checks listed are scientifically sound and tied to $h_\\alpha$: charge invariance upon refinement, conservation of total electrons, and decay of a discrete zero-flux residual. Option A is correct.\n\nOption B: This option uses finite differences to compute $\\nabla \\rho$, which is a legitimate alternative in general, but the prompt specifically requires an FFT-based gradient. More critically, it traces steepest-descent to local minima of $\\rho$ to define basins, which contradicts the Bader definition based on ascent to maxima and zero-flux boundaries around maxima, thus yielding the wrong partition. It also sets $q_A = N_A - Z_A$, which reverses the usual sign convention, and proposes convergence based on the Kohn–Sham total energy change, which is not an appropriate metric for the convergence of population analysis with respect to real-space grid spacing. Option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: This option omits the factor of $i$ in the reciprocal-space derivative and introduces an incorrect sign, proposing to inverse transform $-\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}} \\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbf{n}})$, which does not represent $\\nabla \\rho$ and would instead produce a non-physical field. It also misapplies the minimum-image convention in reciprocal space for choosing real-space neighbor steps; the minimum-image convention must be applied in real space when traversing across periodic boundaries, not by wrapping $\\mathbf{G}$-vectors. Further, it integrates $\\rho^{1/2}$ to damp noise, which has no basis in electron population definitions and would bias populations. The convergence criterion based solely on the number of basins is insufficient and can be misleading (topology may stabilize before charges converge quantitatively). Option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: Although it uses FFTs to compute $\\nabla \\rho$ as in option A, it does not actually use $\\nabla \\rho$ to define Bader basins; instead, it assigns points to nearest nuclei by Euclidean distance, which yields Voronoi (or Wigner–Seitz) cells. These cells generally do not satisfy the zero-flux condition for $\\nabla \\rho$ and do not reflect the Bader partition. The convergence check comparing against Mulliken charges is not an intrinsic or reliable metric for convergence of a real-space Bader analysis with respect to grid spacing, and insensitivity to $h_\\alpha$ does not validate correctness of the partitioning method. Option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option A provides a correct derivation and algorithmic prescription consistent with FFT-based gradients, the minimum-image convention in periodic boundary conditions, and appropriate convergence checks with respect to the real-space grid spacing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2770819"}]}
