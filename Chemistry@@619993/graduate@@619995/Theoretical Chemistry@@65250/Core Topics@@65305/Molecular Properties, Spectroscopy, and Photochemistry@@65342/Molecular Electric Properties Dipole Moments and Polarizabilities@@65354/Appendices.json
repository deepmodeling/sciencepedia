It is a self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed theoretical exercise. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe total potential energy, $U_{\\text{total}}(x)$, of the bound charge in the external electric field is the sum of its internal mechanical potential energy and its interaction energy with the field.\n$$\nU_{\\text{total}}(x) = U_{\\text{spr}}(x) + U_{\\text{int}}(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the provided expressions for the potential energy terms and the dipole moment definition $\\mu = qx$, we obtain:\n$$\nU_{\\text{total}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 - (q x) E\n$$\nThe condition of mechanical equilibrium states that the net force on the particle is zero. The force $F(x)$ is the negative gradient of the potential energy. For a one-dimensional system, this is:\n$$\nF(x) = -\\frac{dU_{\\text{total}}(x)}{dx}\n$$\nCalculating the derivative of the total potential energy with respect to the displacement $x$:\n$$\nF(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 - q E x \\right) = -(k x - q E) = -k x + q E\n$$\nThe first term, $-k x$, is the restoring force of the harmonic oscillator (Hooke's Law). The second term, $q E$, is the electrostatic force exerted by the external field. At the equilibrium position, which we denote as $x_{\\text{eq}}$, the net force is zero:\n$$\nF(x_{\\text{eq}}) = -k x_{\\text{eq}} + q E = 0\n$$\nSolving this equation for the equilibrium displacement $x_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$$\nk x_{\\text{eq}} = q E\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{q E}{k}\n$$\nThis displacement $x_{\\text{eq}}$ from the origin is induced by the external electric field $E$.

The force constant $k$ represents the stiffness of the harmonic potential that binds the charge $q$ to its equilibrium position at $x=0$. A large value of $k$ corresponds to a \"stiff\" spring, meaning the charge is tightly bound. In this case, a given external electric field $E$ can only produce a small displacement $x_{\\text{eq}}$, resulting in a small induced dipole moment $\\mu_{\\text{ind}}$ and thus a low polarizability. Conversely, a small value of $k$ corresponds to a \"soft\" spring, where the charge is loosely bound. The same electric field $E$ can cause a large displacement, leading to a large induced dipole moment and high polarizability. Therefore, the polarizability is a measure of how easily the charge distribution of the system can be distorted by an external electric field, and this ease of distortion is inversely related to the strength of the internal restoring forces, quantified here by $k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{q^2}{k}}\n$$", "id": "2786719"}, {"introduction": "Having established a classical intuition, we now turn to the language of modern quantum chemistry.

It is based on fundamental principles of linear response theory in theoretical chemistry and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. The problem is therefore valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct tasks: first, to derive the atomic unit of polarizability in terms of the Bohr radius, $a_0$; second, to explain its dimensional connection to volume; and third, to compute the isotropic mean polarizability for a given molecule and convert it to standard units.\n\nWe begin with the first task. The relationship between the induced dipole moment, $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{ind}}$, and the external electric field, $\\vec{E}$, is given by the polarizability tensor $\\alpha_{ij}$:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^{(0)} + \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{ij} E_j $$\nHere, $\\mu_i^{(0)}$ is the permanent dipole moment component. The induced component is $\\mu_{i, \\text{ind}} = \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{ij} E_j$. For dimensional analysis, we can simplify this to a scalar relation: $\\mu_{\\text{ind}} = \\alpha E$. The dimensions of polarizability, denoted $[\\alpha]$, must therefore satisfy:\n$$ [\\alpha] = \\frac{[\\mu]}{[E]} $$\nWe must determine the units of dipole moment, $[\\mu]$, and electric field, $[E]$, in the Hartree atomic unit system. The problem specifies the base units: the elementary charge $e=1$, the electron mass $m_e=1$, the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar=1$, and the Coulomb force constant is such that $4\\pi\\epsilon_0=1$.\n\nThe unit of length in this system is the Bohr radius, $a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}$. In atomic units, this becomes $a_0 = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1^2}{1 \\cdot 1^2} = 1$.\nThe unit of energy is the Hartree, $E_h = \\frac{m_e e^4}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2}$. In atomic units, this becomes $E_h = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1^4}{1^2 \\cdot 1^2} = 1$.\n\nA dipole moment, $\\mu$, has dimensions of charge times length. In atomic units, this is:\n$$ [\\mu]_{\\text{a.u.}} = e \\cdot a_0 $$\nAn electric field, $E$, has dimensions of force per unit charge, which is equivalent to energy per (charge times length). In atomic units, this is:\n$$ [E]_{\\text{a.u.}} = \\frac{E_h}{e \\cdot a_0} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the dimensions of polarizability:\n$$ [\\alpha]_{\\text{a.u.}} = \\frac{[\\mu]_{\\text{a.u.}}}{[E]_{\\text{a.u.}}} = \\frac{e \\cdot a_0}{E_h / (e \\cdot a_0)} = \\frac{e^2 a_0^2}{E_h} $$\nTo express this solely in terms of $a_0$, we use the definition of the Hartree energy, $E_h$, in terms of $a_0$: $E_h = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 a_0}$.\nSubstituting this for $E_h$:\n$$ [\\alpha]_{\\text{a.u.}} = \\frac{e^2 a_0^2}{e^2 / (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 a_0)} = (4\\pi\\epsilon_0) a_0^3 $$\nSince the problem defines the Hartree system of atomic units where $4\\pi\\epsilon_0 = 1$, the atomic unit of polarizability is indeed:\n$$ [\\alpha]_{\\text{a.u.}} = a_0^3 $$\nThis completes the first task. For the second task, this result provides the direct explanation. The atomic unit of polarizability is the cube of the atomic unit of length, $a_0^3$. Dimensionally, length cubed is a volume. Therefore, polarizability expressed in atomic units has the dimension of volume. This is physically intuitive: polarizability measures the deformability of the electron cloud, a property that is expected to scale with the volume occupied by the electrons. For a simple model of a perfectly conducting sphere of radius $R$, its polarizability is $\\alpha = 4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3$. In Hartree atomic units where $4\\pi\\epsilon_0=1$, this becomes $\\alpha = R^3$, directly equating polarizability to a volume.\n\nNow, we proceed to the third task, the numerical calculation. The isotropic mean polarizability, $\\bar{\\alpha}$, is defined as one-third of the trace of the polarizability tensor. For a tensor given in its principal axis system, this is the average of the diagonal components:\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} (\\alpha_{xx} + \\alpha_{yy} + \\alpha_{zz}) $$\nThe problem provides the principal components: $\\alpha_{xx} = 10.2\\,\\text{a.u.}$, $\\alpha_{yy} = 8.9\\,\\text{a.u.}$, and $\\alpha_{zz} = 13.7\\,\\text{a.u.}$. We substitute these values into the formula:\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} (10.2 + 8.9 + 13.7)\\,\\text{a.u.} $$\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{3} (32.8)\\,\\text{a.u.} \\approx 10.9333...\\,\\text{a.u.} $$\nThe final step is to convert this result from atomic units to cubic angstroms ($\\text{\\AA}^3$). The problem supplies the conversion factor: $1\\,\\text{a.u.}$ of polarizability is equivalent to $a_0^3$, which is $0.1481847\\,\\text{\\AA}^3$.\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} [\\text{\\AA}^3] = \\frac{32.8}{3} \\times 0.1481847\\,\\text{\\AA}^3 $$\n$$ \\bar{\\alpha} [\\text{\\AA}^3] \\approx 10.9333... \\times 0.1481847\\,\\text{\\AA}^3 \\approx 1.620246416\\,\\text{\\AA}^3 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Single-term leading-order power-law behavior: The model $\\Delta\\alpha(X)\\approx A X^{-p}$ with $p=4$ assumes that the dominant contribution to the basis-set error arises from the highest angular momenta not yet saturated, which, for response properties with augmented correlation-consistent basis sets, follows a $X^{-4}$ decay. This is motivated by the partial-wave analysis of electron correlation and the way additional polarization shells systematically recover the missing response density.\n\n2. Monotonic, regular convergence: It is assumed that $\\alpha(X)$ approaches $\\alpha(\\infty)$ smoothly and monotonically for sufficiently large $X$, so that higher-order terms like $B X^{-6}$ are small compared to the leading $A X^{-4}$ term between $X=4$ and $X=5$. The aug-cc-pV$X$Z sequence is designed to deliver such systematic convergence.\n\n3. Consistent electron correlation treatment: Both values are computed at the same correlated level (CCSD(T)) and geometry, ensuring that differences reflect basis-set incompleteness rather than changes in electron correlation or structure.\n\n4. Adequate treatment of diffuseness: Because $\\alpha$ probes the long-range response, augmented functions are essential; the use of aug-cc-pV$X$Z mitigates diffuse incompleteness so that angular-momentum incompleteness dominates and the $X^{-4}$ model is applicable.\n\n5. Linear-response regime and numerical stability: The finite fields are small enough to remain in the linear regime and numerical differentiation errors are negligible compared to basis-set errors, so that the extrapolated value reflects the underlying analytic property.\n\nUnder these conditions, the two-point estimator provides a reliable approximation to the CBS limit for $\\alpha_{zz}(0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.359}$$", "id": "2786747"}]}
