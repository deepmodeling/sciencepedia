{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "At the heart of Ligand Field Theory lies the quantitative assessment of electron configuration stability. This practice focuses on the fundamental energetic trade-off between the ligand field stabilization energy ($\\text{LFSE}$), which arises from the splitting of d-orbitals, and the electron-electron repulsion cost of pairing electrons in the same orbital, known as the pairing energy ($P$).

High-Spin (HS) Configuration:\nIn the high-spin case, electrons occupy orbitals to maximize spin multiplicity (Hund's rule) before pairing. The six $d$-electrons are distributed by placing one electron in each of the five $d$ orbitals ($t_{2g}$ and $e_g$) first, and then the sixth electron pairs up in a $t_{2g}$ orbital.\nThe resulting electron configuration is $t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals, $n = 4$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$ orbitals, $m = 2$.\n\nThe LFSE for the HS state is:\n$$\\text{LFSE}_{\\mathrm{HS}} = \\left( 4 \\times \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) \\right) + \\left( 2 \\times \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{8}{5}\\Delta_o + \\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_o = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o$$\nIn the $t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$ configuration, there are $4$ electrons in the $3$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals, resulting in one electron pair.

Low-Spin (LS) Configuration:\nIn the low-spin case, electrons fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals. The six $d$-electrons all occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\nThe resulting electron configuration is $t_{2g}^6 e_g^0$.\n- Number of electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals, $n = 6$.\n- Number of electrons in $e_g$ orbitals, $m = 0$.\n\nThe LFSE for the LS state is:\n$$\\text{LFSE}_{\\mathrm{LS}} = \\left( 6 \\times \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) \\right) + \\left( 0 \\times \\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_o\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{12}{5}\\Delta_o$$\nIn the $t_{2g}^6$ configuration, the $6$ electrons occupy the $3$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals, resulting in three electron pairs.

This is expected, as the pairing energy $P = 18{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ is greater than the octahedral splitting energy $\\Delta_o = 15{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. It is energetically less costly to promote electrons to the $e_g$ orbitals than to pair them in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n\n4.

We can use the symbolic expressions derived earlier.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = \\left(-\\frac{12}{5}\\Delta_o + 3P\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o + P\\right)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = -\\frac{12}{5}\\Delta_o + 3P + \\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_o - P$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = \\left(-\\frac{12}{5} + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\Delta_o + (3-1)P$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = -\\frac{10}{5}\\Delta_o + 2P = -2\\Delta_o + 2P$$\nNow, substitute the given numerical values:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = -2(15{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}) + 2(18{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1})$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = -30{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1} + 36{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{LS}} - E_{\\mathrm{HS}} = 6{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\nThe positive result confirms that the low-spin state is $6{,}000\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ higher in energy than the high-spin state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6000}$$", "id": "2633942"}, {"introduction": "Moving from pure theory to experimental chemistry, we often face the challenge of deducing the electronic structure of a newly synthesized complex from empirical measurements.

In an octahedral crystal field, the $d$-orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_g$ set. For a $d^6$ ion, two spin states are possible:\n    - **High-spin**: The electron configuration is $t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$. This configuration maximizes the spin multiplicity according to Hund's rule, resulting in $n=4$ unpaired electrons. The total spin quantum number is $S = n/2 = 4/2 = 2$.\n    - **Low-spin**: The electron configuration is $t_{2g}^6 e_g^0$. All electrons occupy the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals and are paired, resulting in $n=0$ unpaired electrons. The total spin quantum number is $S = n/2 = 0$.\n\n    The problem specifies the use of the spin-only formula for the effective magnetic moment, which is given by:\n    $$ \\mu_{S.O.} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}} $$\n    where $n$ is the number of unpaired electrons and $\\mu_{\\text{B}}$ is the Bohr magneton.\n\n    - For the high-spin case ($n=4$): $\\mu_{S.O.} = \\sqrt{4(4+2)} = \\sqrt{24} \\approx 4.90\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$.\n    - For the low-spin case ($n=0$): $\\mu_{S.O.} = \\sqrt{0(0+2)} = 0\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$.\n\n    The experimentally measured magnetic moment is $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = 5.2\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$. This value is drastically different from the $0\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$ expected for the low-spin case, but it is very close to the $4.90\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$ predicted for the high-spin case. The deviation from the spin-only value is expected and attributable to orbital angular momentum contributions, which arise because the ground electronic term for high-spin $d^6$ (${}^5T_{2g}$) is orbitally triply degenerate.\n    Thus, the magnetic data unequivocally establish that $[\\text{Fe(H}_2\\text{O)}_6]^{2+}$ is a **high-spin** complex with $S=2$.\n\n2.  **Assignment of Electronic Transitions and $10Dq$**\n    For a high-spin $d^6$ complex ($t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$), Crystal Field Theory predicts only one spin-allowed electronic transition. This transition involves the promotion of an electron from a $t_{2g}$ orbital to an $e_g$ orbital, resulting in the excited state configuration $t_{2g}^3 e_g^3$.\n    In terms of spectroscopic term symbols, this corresponds to the transition from the ground state ${}^5T_{2g}$ to the excited state ${}^5E_g$.\n    $$ {}^5T_{2g} \\rightarrow {}^5E_g $$\n    The energy of this transition is by definition equal to the octahedral crystal-field splitting parameter, $10Dq$ (also denoted $\\Delta_o$).\n    $$ \\Delta E = E({}^5E_g) - E({}^5T_{2g}) = 10Dq $$\n    The provided spectrum shows a broad, weak band at $\\tilde{\\nu}_1 = 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. This absorption is assigned to the spin-allowed ${}^5T_{2g} \\rightarrow {}^5E_g$ transition. Therefore, the estimate for the crystal field splitting parameter is:\n    $$ 10Dq \\approx 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} $$\n    The second band at $\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = 19{,}000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is likely due to either a spin-forbidden transition or, more accurately, a splitting of the ${}^5E_g$ excited state due to a Jahn-Teller distortion (as the $t_{2g}^3 e_g^3$ configuration is orbitally degenerate). Regardless of the precise assignment of the second band, the fundamental $10Dq$ value is determined by the energy of the primary spin-allowed transition.\n\n3.  **Consistency with the Spectrochemical Series**\n    The spectrochemical series ranks ligands according to their ability to split the d-orbitals. $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ is classified as a weak-field ligand.\n    - **Weak-field ligands** cause a relatively small crystal field splitting ($10Dq$).\n    - The spin state of a complex is determined by the balance between $10Dq$ and the mean spin-pairing energy, $P$. For a $d^6$ ion, the complex is high-spin if $10Dq  P$ and low-spin if $10Dq  P$.\n    - For $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$, the pairing energy is approximately $P \\approx 17{,}600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n    - Our determined value is $10Dq \\approx 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Since $10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}  17{,}600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, the theory correctly predicts a high-spin state.\n    - A $10Dq$ value of $\\sim 10{,}000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is typical for divalent aquo complexes of the first-row transition metals.\n    - Therefore, the finding that $[\\text{Fe(H}_2\\text{O)}_6]^{2+}$ is high-spin with $10Dq \\approx 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is entirely consistent with the established position of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ as a weak-field ligand.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. High-spin ($S=2$), $10Dq \\approx 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$; this is consistent with $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ as a weak-field ligand.**\n  - **Spin State**: Correct. The magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = 5.2\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$ corresponds to a high-spin $d^6$ configuration ($S=2$).\n  - **$10Dq$**: Correct. The single spin-allowed transition for high-spin $d^6$ corresponds to the observed band at $10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n  - **Consistency**: Correct. A weak-field ligand like $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ is expected to produce a high-spin complex with a relatively small $10Dq$ value, which is precisely what is observed and calculated.\n  - **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Low-spin ($S=0$), $10Dq \\approx 22{,}000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$; this is consistent with $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ as a strong-field ligand.**\n  - **Spin State**: Incorrect. A low-spin complex would be diamagnetic ($\\mu_{\\text{eff}}=0\\,\\mu_{\\text{B}}$), contradicting the experimental data.\n  - **$10Dq$**: Incorrect. This value does not correspond to any reasonable assignment from the given spectrum for either a high-spin or low-spin case.\n  - **Consistency**: Incorrect. $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ is not a strong-field ligand.\n  - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. High-spin ($S=2$), $10Dq \\approx 22{,}000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$; this is inconsistent because such a large splitting would typically favor low spin for $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$ with $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.**\n  - **Spin State**: Correct.\n  - **$10Dq$**: Incorrect. The value $22{,}000\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is not supported by the spectroscopic data for a high-spin $d^6$ complex.\n  - **Consistency Statement**: The internal logic of the consistency statement is sound (a large $10Dq$ would favor low spin, creating an inconsistency), but it is based on a false premise for $10Dq$.\n  - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Low-spin ($S=0$), $10Dq \\approx 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$; this is inconsistent with the observed magnetic moment but compatible with the spectrochemical series.**\n  - **Spin State**: Incorrect. It contradicts the magnetic data.\n  - **$10Dq$**: The value is taken from the spectrum, but the condition $10Dq \\approx 10{,}800\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is less than the pairing energy for $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$, which would dictate a high-spin state, not a low-spin one. This creates an internal contradiction.\n  - **Consistency Statement**: It correctly notes the inconsistency with magnetism. However, claiming this scenario is \"compatible with the spectrochemical series\" is flawed. While the $10Dq$ value is compatible with $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ being a weak-field ligand, a weak-field ligand would not produce a low-spin $\\text{Fe}^{2+}$ complex.\n  - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A provides a fully self-consistent analysis that correctly integrates the magnetic and spectroscopic data within the framework of crystal field theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2633972"}, {"introduction": "While Crystal Field Theory's single parameter, $\\Delta_o$, provides a powerful descriptive framework, the Angular Overlap Model (AOM) offers a deeper, more chemically intuitive picture by dissecting this parameter into its causal bonding contributions.

The line should look like\n$$\n\\big[ \\ [\\ \\cdots\\ ],\\ \\mathrm{RMSE} \\ \\big]\n$$\nwith all numeric values in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The program must be self-contained, require no input, and print exactly this single line.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. It is a standard application of the Angular Overlap Model (AOM), a cornerstone of modern ligand field theory. We shall proceed with the derivation and computational implementation.\n\n### Task A: Derivation of $\\Delta_o$ using the Angular Overlap Model\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the octahedral splitting parameter, $\\Delta_o$, for a homoleptic octahedral complex $[ML_6]$ in terms of the AOM parameters $e_\\sigma$ and $e_\\pi$. The derivation will be built from first principles of orbital symmetry and interaction geometry.\n\nWe place the metal ion $M$ at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system. The six identical ligands $L$ are positioned on the axes at distances $\\pm R$, defining an ideal $O_h$ symmetry. The metal's five valence $d$-orbitals split under this $O_h$ field into two symmetry sets: the doubly degenerate $e_g$ set ($d_{z^2}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$) and the triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ set ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$).\n\nThe AOM posits that the energy shift, $\\delta E$, of a metal $d$-orbital is the sum of pairwise interactions with each ligand. The interaction energy with a single ligand is given by the sum of $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ contributions, weighted by the square of the corresponding angular overlap factors, which depend on geometry.\n$$ \\delta E = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left( S_{\\sigma, i}^2 e_\\sigma + S_{\\pi, i}^2 e_\\pi \\right) $$\nHere, $S_{\\sigma, i}^2$ and $S_{\\pi, i}^2$ are the geometric factors for the interaction of the specific $d$-orbital with ligand $i$.\n\n**1. Energy of the $e_g$ orbitals**\n\nThe $e_g$ orbitals ($d_{z^2}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$) possess lobes that are directed along the Cartesian axes, towards the ligands. Consequently, these orbitals participate in $\\sigma$-bonding. By symmetry, they do not participate in $\\pi$-bonding with ligands positioned on the axes, so their energy shift depends only on $e_\\sigma$. We calculate the energy for one member of the set, for instance $d_{z^2}$. The result must be identical for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ due to the degeneracy of the $e_g$ set.\n\nThe total energy shift $\\delta E(d_{z^2})$ is the sum of interactions with all $6$ ligands.\n- **Ligands on the $z$-axis ($L_{\\pm z}$):** The $d_{z^2}$ orbital points directly at these two ligands. The overlap is maximal, so the geometric factor for $\\sigma$-interaction is $S_{\\sigma}^2 = 1$. The contribution from these two ligands is $2 \\times (1 \\cdot e_\\sigma) = 2e_\\sigma$.\n- **Ligands on the $x$- and $y$-axes ($L_{\\pm x}, L_{\\pm y}$):** These four ligands lie in the equatorial plane of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. The angular part of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is proportional to $(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1)$. For a ligand on the $x$-axis, $\\theta = \\pi/2$, so the angular function's value is relevant. The standard AOM geometrical factor for this orientation, derived from the rotation properties of spherical harmonics, is $S_{\\sigma}^2 = 1/4$. Thus, the contribution from these four ligands is $4 \\times (1/4 \\cdot e_\\sigma) = e_\\sigma$.\n\nThe total energy shift for the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ E(e_g) = \\delta E(d_{z^2}) = 2e_\\sigma + e_\\sigma = 3e_\\sigma $$\nA consistent result of $3e_\\sigma$ is obtained for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, confirming the degeneracy. The total $\\sigma$-destabilization of $2 \\times 3e_\\sigma = 6e_\\sigma$ is entirely contained within the $e_g$ set, as expected from group theory.\n\n**2. Energy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals**\n\nThe $t_{2g}$ orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) have their lobes directed between the Cartesian axes. The ligand positions on the axes coincide with the nodal planes of these orbitals. Therefore, the $\\sigma$-overlap is zero, and these orbitals do not participate in $\\sigma$-bonding ($S_{\\sigma}^2 = 0$ for all $6$ ligands). Their energy shift is determined solely by $\\pi$-interactions with $e_\\pi$.\n\nWe calculate the energy for one member of the set, for instance $d_{xy}$. The ligand $\\pi$-orbitals can be oriented in two orthogonal directions perpendicular to the metal-ligand bond axis.\n- **Ligands on the $z$-axis ($L_{\\pm z}$):** These ligands lie on an axis perpendicular to the $xy$-plane where the $d_{xy}$ orbital resides. There is no net overlap between the ligand $\\pi$-orbitals and the $d_{xy}$ orbital. The contribution is $0$.\n- **Ligands on the $x$-axis ($L_{\\pm x}$):** A ligand on the $x$-axis has $\\pi$-orbitals that can be aligned with the $y$- and $z$-directions. The ligand $\\pi$-orbital oriented along the $y$-direction has perfect overlap with the lobes of the $d_{xy}$ orbital. The geometric factor is $S_{\\pi}^2 = 1$. The ligand $\\pi$-orbital along the $z$-direction is orthogonal and does not contribute. So, each of the two ligands on the $x$-axis contributes $1 \\cdot e_\\pi$. The total contribution is $2e_\\pi$.\n- **Ligands on the $y$-axis ($L_{\\pm y}$):** By identical reasoning, the $\\pi$-orbitals of these ligands aligned with the $x$-direction overlap with the $d_{xy}$ orbital. The contribution from these two ligands is also $2e_\\pi$.\n\nThe total energy shift for the $d_{xy}$ orbital is the sum of these $\\pi$-contributions:\n$$ E(t_{2g}) = \\delta E(d_{xy}) = 0 + 2e_\\pi + 2e_\\pi = 4e_\\pi $$\nThis result is identical for $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ due to symmetry, confirming the degeneracy of the $t_{2g}$ set. The total $\\pi$-interaction energy of $3 \\times 4e_\\pi = 12e_\\pi$ is distributed among the $t_{2g}$ orbitals, consistent with group theory (there are $12$ ligand $\\pi$-orbitals, and the $t_{2g}$ subset interacts with the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals).\n\n**3. The Octahedral Splitting Parameter, $\\Delta_o$**\n\nThe parameter $\\Delta_o$ is defined as the energy difference between the $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ manifolds.\n$$ \\Delta_o = E(e_g) - E(t_{2g}) $$\nSubstituting the derived energies, we obtain the fundamental AOM expression for $\\Delta_o$:\n$$ \\Delta_o = 3e_\\sigma - 4e_\\pi $$\nThis expression correctly accounts for the fact that $\\sigma$-donors ($e_\\sigma  0$) increase $\\Delta_o$, $\\pi$-donors ($e_\\pi  0$) decrease $\\Delta_o$, and $\\pi$-acceptors ($e_\\pi  0$) increase $\\Delta_o$.\n\n### Task B: Computational Protocol\n\nThe computational task requires the implementation of the derived formula and its application to a series of test cases.\n\n- **Predicted Splitting ($\\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{pred}}$):** This is calculated directly from the derived formula:\n  $$ \\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 3e_\\sigma - 4e_\\pi $$\n- **Component Contributions:** The problem requires separating the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ contributions to $\\Delta_o$. Based on our formula, these are additive components:\n  - The $\\sigma$-contribution, $\\Delta_{o,\\sigma}$, is the term arising from the $\\sigma$-parameter: $\\Delta_{o,\\sigma} = 3e_\\sigma$.\n  - The $\\pi$-contribution, $\\Delta_{o,\\pi}$, is the term arising from the $\\pi$-parameter: $\\Delta_{o,\\pi} = -4e_\\pi$.\n  It is clear that $\\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{pred}} = \\Delta_{o,\\sigma} + \\Delta_{o,\\pi}$.\n- **Residual:** The difference between the AOM prediction and the experimental value:\n  $$ \\text{Residual} = \\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{pred}} - \\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{exp}} $$\n- **Validation Flag:** A boolean value indicating if the model is within the specified tolerance of $500\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$:\n  $$ \\text{Flag} = \\left| \\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{pred}} - \\Delta_o^{\\mathrm{exp}} \\right| \\le 500 $$\n- **Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE):** The overall performance of the model across $N$ test cases is quantified by the RMSE:\n  $$ \\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\Delta_{o,i}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - \\Delta_{o,i}^{\\mathrm{exp}}\\right)^2} $$\n\nThe following program will implement this protocol for the $6$ given test cases and produce the output in the required format.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes AOM predictions for d1 octahedral complexes and compares them to experimental data.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite: (e_sigma, e_pi, Delta_o_exp) in cm^-1\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Approximate sigma-donor water\n        (6500.0, 0.0, 19500.0),\n        # Case B: Approximate sigma-donor ammonia\n        (7000.0, 0.0, 21200.0),\n        # Case C: Weak-field pi-donor chloride\n        (5500.0, 600.0, 14000.0),\n        # Case D: Strong-field pi-acceptor cyanide\n        (7000.0, -800.0, 24500.0),\n        # Case E: Strong-field pi-acceptor carbon monoxide\n        (6800.0, -1000.0, 24000.0),\n        # Case F: Hard sigma-donor fluoride with modest pi-donation\n        (6000.0, 300.0, 17000.0),\n    ]\n\n    tolerance = 500.0\n    num_cases = len(test_cases)\n    \n    per_case_results = []\n    squared_residuals = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        e_sigma, e_pi, delta_o_exp = case\n        \n        # Calculate predicted Delta_o based on the AOM formula for Oh symmetry\n        # Delta_o = 3*e_sigma - 4*e_pi\n        delta_o_pred = 3.0 * e_sigma - 4.0 * e_pi\n        \n        # Separate the sigma and pi contributions to the predicted Delta_o\n        delta_o_sigma_contrib = 3.0 * e_sigma\n        delta_o_pi_contrib = -4.0 * e_pi\n        \n        # Compute the residual\n        residual = delta_o_pred - delta_o_exp\n        squared_residuals.append(residual**2)\n        \n        # Check if the absolute residual is within tolerance\n        is_within_tolerance = abs(residual) = tolerance\n        \n        # Store results for the current case\n        per_case_results.append([\n            delta_o_pred,\n            delta_o_sigma_contrib,\n            delta_o_pi_contrib,\n            residual,\n            is_within_tolerance\n        ])\n\n    # Compute the overall Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)\n    mean_squared_error = sum(squared_residuals) / num_cases\n    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error)\n\n    # Prepare the final output structure: [[case1_results, case2_results, ...], RMSE]\n    final_output = [per_case_results, rmse]\n    \n    # Print the final result in the specified single-line format.\n    # The default string representation of a list in Python matches the required format.\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2767118"}]}
