The problem states that the heavy-atom effect of iodine increases the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) matrix element magnitude, $|\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle|$, by a factor of $f=12$.\n$$\n|\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle'| = f |\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle_{0}|\n$$\nwhere the subscript $0$ refers to the unsubstituted molecule. According to Fermi's golden rule, the rate of a spin-forbidden transition is proportional to the square of the SOC matrix element connecting the initial and final states. The problem specifies that both intersystem crossing and phosphorescence rates scale in this manner.\n$$\nk \\propto |\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle|^{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the new rate constants for ISC and phosphorescence are:\n$$\nk'_{\\mathrm{ISC}} = k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0} \\left( \\frac{|\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle'|}{|\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle_{0}|} \\right)^2 = k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0} f^2\n$$\n$$\nk'_{P} = k_{P,0} \\left( \\frac{|\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle'|}{|\\langle \\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{SO}}\\rangle_{0}|} \\right)^2 = k_{P,0} f^2\n$$\nThe other rate constants ($k_{F}$, $k_{\\mathrm{IC}}$, $k_{T\\mathrm{nr}}$) are stated to be unaffected by iodination.\n$$\nk'_{F} = k_{F} = 2.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk'_{\\mathrm{IC}} = k_{\\mathrm{IC}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk'_{T\\mathrm{nr}} = k_{T\\mathrm{nr}} = 8.00 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the values of the scaled rate constants with $f=12$, so $f^2=144$:\n$$\nk'_{\\mathrm{ISC}} = (3.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 144 = 4.32 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk'_{P} = (2.00 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 144 = 2.88 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nWe now compute the phosphorescence quantum yield for the iodinated derivative, $\\Phi'_{P}$, using these new rate constants.\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P} = \\left( \\frac{k'_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}{k'_{F} + k'_{\\mathrm{IC}} + k'_{\\mathrm{ISC}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k'_{P}}{k'_{P} + k'_{T\\mathrm{nr}}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstitute the numerical values:\nFirst, for the triplet formation yield, $\\Phi'_{T}$:\n$$\n\\Phi'_{T} = \\frac{4.32 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(2.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) + (4.32 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi'_{T} = \\frac{4.32 \\times 10^{9}}{0.02 \\times 10^{9} + 0.10 \\times 10^{9} + 4.32 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{4.32 \\times 10^{9}}{4.44 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{4.32}{4.44}\n$$\nSecond, for the phosphorescence yield from the triplet state, $\\Phi'_{P, T_{1}}$:\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P, T_{1}} = \\frac{2.88 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(2.88 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) + (8.00 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P, T_{1}} = \\frac{2.88 \\times 10^{4}}{2.88 \\times 10^{4} + 0.08 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{2.88 \\times 10^{4}}{2.96 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{2.88}{2.96}\n$$\nIt is instructive to note the specific ratios in the initial data. The total rate of spin-allowed decay from $S_{1}$ is $k_F + k_{IC} = 2.0 \\times 10^7 + 1.0 \\times 10^8 = 1.2 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This is precisely $4$ times $k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0} = 3.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Likewise, the nonradiative decay rate from $T_{1}$ is $k_{T\\mathrm{nr}} = 8.00 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is $4$ times $k_{P,0} = 2.00 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nLet $k_{S,\\mathrm{allowed}} = k_F + k_{IC} = 4k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0}$ and $k_{T\\mathrm{nr}} = 4k_{P,0}$. The expression for $\\Phi'_P$ becomes:\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P} = \\left( \\frac{f^2 k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0}}{4k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0} + f^2 k_{\\mathrm{ISC},0}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{f^2 k_{P,0}}{f^2 k_{P,0} + 4k_{P,0}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P} = \\left( \\frac{f^2}{4 + f^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{f^2}{4 + f^2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{f^2}{4 + f^2} \\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting $f=12$, so $f^2=144$:\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P} = \\left( \\frac{144}{4 + 144} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{144}{148} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{36}{37} \\right)^2\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P} = \\left( \\frac{36}{37} \\right)^2 \\approx (0.97297297...)^2 \\approx 0.9466763...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain the final answer.\n$$\n\\Phi'_{P} \\approx 0.9467\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9467}\n$$", "id": "2782145"}]}
