It represents a standard, fundamental derivation in the theory of vibrational Raman spectroscopy. All necessary conditions and approximations are explicitly provided, rendering the problem valid and solvable without ambiguity. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe intensity of a Raman transition from an initial vibrational state $|v\\rangle$ to a final state $|v'\\rangle$ is governed by two factors: the population of the initial state, $N_v$, and the square of the transition dipole moment, $|\\langle v' | \\hat{\\mathbf{p}}_{\\text{ind}} | v \\rangle|^2$. The problem specifies that the induced dipole moment, within the Placzek approximation, is given by $\\mathbf{p} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{E}$. The oscillatory electric field is $\\mathbf{E}(t) = \\mathbf{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega_L t)$. The component of the induced dipole moment responsible for Raman scattering arises from the modulation of the polarizability $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ by the molecular vibration, represented by the normal coordinate $Q_k$.\n\nThe problem states the polarizability is expanded to first order in $Q_k$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(Q_k) \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_0 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}{\\partial Q_k}\\right)_0 Q_k\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the induced dipole gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}(t) = \\left[ \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_0 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}{\\partial Q_k}\\right)_0 Q_k(t) \\right] \\mathbf{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega_L t)\n$$\nThe first term, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_0 \\mathbf{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega_L t)$, corresponds to Rayleigh scattering at the incident frequency $\\omega_L$. The second term, involving the derivative of the polarizability, $\\left(\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}/\\partial Q_k\\right)_0$, is the source of Raman scattering. The transition moment for a vibrational transition is therefore proportional to the matrix element of the normal coordinate operator, $\\hat{Q}_k$:\n$$\n\\langle v' | \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}{\\partial Q_k}\\right)_0 \\hat{Q}_k | v \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}{\\partial Q_k}\\right)_0 \\langle v' | \\hat{Q}_k | v \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states that the Raman tensor element $\\left(\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}/\\partial Q_k\\right)_0$ and scattering geometry are the same for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes, thus this prefactor will cancel in the intensity ratio. The problem also specifies that any frequency dependence of scattering efficiency (the $\\omega_s^4$ factor) is to be ignored. Therefore, the ratio of intensities depends only on the initial state populations and the matrix elements of $\\hat{Q}_k$.\n\nThe vibrational mode is treated as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The non-zero matrix elements of the position operator $\\hat{Q}_k$ are governed by the selection rule $\\Delta v = v'-v = \\pm 1$.

The sum becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{v=1}^{\\infty} N_v (v) = \\sum_{u=0}^{\\infty} N_{u+1} (u+1)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the ratio, and replacing the dummy index $u$ with $v$ for consistency, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{S}}}{I_{\\mathrm{AS}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} N_v (v+1)}{\\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} N_{v+1} (v+1)}\n$$\nNow, we relate the populations of adjacent levels using the Boltzmann distribution. The energy difference between level $v+1$ and $v$ is $\\Delta E = E_{v+1} - E_v = \\hbar\\omega_k$.\n$$\n\\frac{N_{v+1}}{N_v} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-E_{v+1}/(k_B T)\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-E_v/(k_B T)\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{v+1}-E_v}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_k}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, we can write $N_{v+1} = N_v \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_k}{k_B T}\\right)$.

These terms represent the interference between the polarizability modulations associated with the motions of different atoms. They **necessarily contain cross-atom interference** and are not additive. Their sign can be positive or negative, corresponding to constructive or destructive interference between the contributions from different atoms to the overall mode-specific Raman activity.\nThis decomposition thus provides a formal and physically meaningful method for partitioning the total Raman intensity of a given vibrational mode into additive atomic \"self\" contributions and non-additive \"cross\" or \"interference\" contributions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{ij}}{\\partial Q_k}\\right)_{0} = \\sum_{A=1}^{N} \\sum_{a \\in \\{x,y,z\\}} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{ij}}{\\partial R_{A,a}}\\right)_{0} \\frac{L_{A,a}^{(k)}}{\\sqrt{m_A}}}\n$$", "id": "2800004"}]}
