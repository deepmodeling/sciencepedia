I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a series of derivations culminating in a function $f(\\theta)$ that describes the partitioning of orbital coupling in an $\\text{AH}_{3}$ molecule. We will proceed step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we determine the symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of the hydrogen $1s$ orbitals $\\{h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3}\\}$. This requires finding the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{H}$ spanned by this basis set in the $D_{3h}$ and $C_{3v}$ point groups and decomposing it into irreducible representations (irreps).\n\nFor the $C_{3v}$ point group (pyramidal geometry), the symmetry operations are $E$, $2C_{3}$, and $3\\sigma_{v}$. The effect of these operations on the three hydrogen atoms, which form the basis $\\{h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3}\\}$, gives the characters of the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{H}$.\n-   $E$: Leaves all $3$ atoms unchanged. $\\chi(E) = 3$.\n-   $C_{3}$: Cyclically permutes all $3$ atoms. $\\chi(C_{3}) = 0$.\n-   $\\sigma_{v}$: Each vertical mirror plane contains one A-H bond. It leaves that one H atom unchanged and permutes the other two. $\\chi(\\sigma_{v}) = 1$.\nThus, the character vector for $\\Gamma_{H}$ in $C_{3v}$ is $(3, 0, 1)$.\n\nUsing the reduction formula $n_{i} = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{R} \\chi_{\\Gamma}(R) \\chi_{i}(R)$, where $|G|=6$ is the order of the group, and the $C_{3v}$ character table, we decompose $\\Gamma_{H}$:\n-   $n_{A_{1}} = \\frac{1}{6}[1 \\cdot (3)(1) + 2 \\cdot (0)(1) + 3 \\cdot (1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+3) = 1$.\n-   $n_{A_{2}} = \\frac{1}{6}[1 \\cdot (3)(1) + 2 \\cdot (0)(1) + 3 \\cdot (1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}(3-3) = 0$.\n-   $n_{E} = \\frac{1}{6}[1 \\cdot (3)(2) + 2 \\cdot (0)(-1) + 3 \\cdot (1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}(6) = 1$.\nSo, $\\Gamma_{H}$ decomposes into $A_{1} \\oplus E$. This implies there is one SALC of $A_{1}$ symmetry and a degenerate pair of SALCs of $E$ symmetry.\n\nFor the $D_{3h}$ point group (trigonal planar geometry, $\\theta = \\pi/2$), the characters are: $\\chi(E)=3$, $\\chi(C_{3})=0$, $\\chi(C_{2})=1$, $\\chi(\\sigma_{h})=3$, $\\chi(S_{3})=0$, $\\chi(\\sigma_{v})=1$. The character vector for $\\Gamma_{H}$ is $(3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1)$. Using the $D_{3h}$ character table and the reduction formula with $|G|=12$, we find $\\Gamma_{H} = A_{1}' \\oplus E'$.\n\nNow, we construct the normalized SALCs using the projection operator method. The results are identical in form for both groups, differing only in their irrep labels.\n-   For the totally symmetric irrep ($A_{1}$ in $C_{3v}$, $A_{1}'$ in $D_{3h}$), the projector applied to $h_{1}$ yields a function proportional to $h_{1}+h_{2}+h_{3}$. Assuming the basis functions are orthonormal ($\\langle h_{i} | h_{j} \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$), the normalization constant is $1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $$ \\Psi_{A_{1}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(h_{1} + h_{2} + h_{3}) $$\n-   For the doubly degenerate irrep ($E$ in $C_{3v}$, $E'$ in $D_{3h}$), applying the projector for $E$ to $h_{1}$ yields a function proportional to $2h_{1} - h_{2} - h_{3}$. Normalizing this gives:\n    $$ \\Psi_{E,a} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2h_{1} - h_{2} - h_{3}) $$\n    A second, orthogonal partner can be constructed, for example, by taking the normalized difference of $h_{2}$ and $h_{3}$:\n    $$ \\Psi_{E,b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(h_{2} - h_{3}) $$\n    These two functions, $\\Psi_{E,a}$ and $\\Psi_{E,b}$, form an orthonormal basis for the $E$ representation.\n\nNext, we identify the symmetries of the central atom's valence orbitals ($s$, $p_{x}$, $p_{y}$, $p_{z}$) to determine possible couplings. An interaction is allowed by symmetry only if the involved orbitals belong to the same irrep.\n-   In $C_{3v}$: $s$ has $A_{1}$ symmetry. $p_{z}$ (along the principal axis) has $A_{1}$ symmetry. The pair $(p_{x}, p_{y})$ transforms as the $E$ representation.\n    -   Coupling: $s(A_{1})$ and $p_{z}(A_{1})$ couple with $\\Psi_{A_{1}}$. The $(p_{x}, p_{y})(E)$ pair couples with $(\\Psi_{E,a}, \\Psi_{E,b})(E)$.\n-   In $D_{3h}$: $s$ has $A_{1}'$ symmetry. $(p_{x}, p_{y})$ lie in the symmetry plane $\\sigma_{h}$ and transform as $E'$. $p_{z}$ is perpendicular to $\\sigma_{h}$ and transforms as $A_{2}''$.\n    -   Coupling: $s(A_{1}')$ couples with $\\Psi_{A_{1}'}$. $(p_{x}, p_{y})(E')$ couple with $(\\Psi_{E,a}, \\Psi_{E,b})(E')$. Notably, the central $p_{z}(A_{2}'')$ orbital has no symmetry match among the H SALCs ($A_{1}' \\oplus E'$) and is therefore non-bonding in the planar geometry.\n\nThe final task is to quantify the coupling in the $C_{3v}$ case using the specified tight-binding model. The interaction matrix element between a central p-orbital with orientation $\\mathbf{u}$ and a hydrogen $1s$ orbital on bond direction $\\mathbf{r}$ is $\\beta_{p} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}$. The total squared coupling is the sum of the squares of all Hamiltonian matrix elements between the $p$-orbital manifold $\\{p_x, p_y, p_z\\}$ and the SALC manifold $\\{\\Psi_{A_1}, \\Psi_{E,a}, \\Psi_{E,b}\\}$.\n\nWe calculate the squared coupling for the $a_{1}$ block. This involves the coupling between the central orbital of $A_{1}$ symmetry, $p_{z}$, and the SALC of $A_{1}$ symmetry, $\\Psi_{A_{1}}$. The orientation vector for $p_{z}$ is $\\mathbf{u}_{z} = (0, 0, 1)$. The hydrogen bond vector is $\\mathbf{r}_{k} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi_{k}, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi_{k}, \\cos\\theta)$.\nThe interaction with a single hydrogen $h_{k}$ is $\\langle p_{z} | \\hat{H} | h_{k} \\rangle = \\beta_{p} \\mathbf{u}_{z} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{k} = \\beta_{p} \\cos\\theta$. This is independent of $k$.\nThe matrix element with the SALC is:\n$$ \\langle p_{z} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{A_{1}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\langle p_{z} | \\hat{H} | h_{k} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(3 \\beta_{p} \\cos\\theta) = \\sqrt{3} \\beta_{p} \\cos\\theta $$\nThe squared coupling for the $a_{1}$ block is therefore:\n$$ S_{a_{1}}^{2} = |\\langle p_{z} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{A_{1}} \\rangle|^{2} = 3 \\beta_{p}^{2} \\cos^{2}\\theta $$\n\nNext, we calculate the squared coupling for the $e$ block. This involves the coupling between $(p_{x}, p_{y})$ and $(\\Psi_{E,a}, \\Psi_{E,b})$. We need the dot products $\\mathbf{u}_{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{k} = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{y} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{k} = \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi_{k}$. With $\\phi_{k} = 0, 2\\pi/3, 4\\pi/3$, we have $\\cos\\phi_{k} = (1, -1/2, -1/2)$ and $\\sin\\phi_{k} = (0, \\sqrt{3}/2, -\\sqrt{3}/2)$ for $k=1, 2, 3$.\n\n$$ \\langle p_{x} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{E,a} \\rangle = \\frac{\\beta_{p}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} c_{k} (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi_{k}) = \\frac{\\beta_{p}\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{6}} [2(1) - 1(-1/2) - 1(-1/2)] = \\frac{3\\beta_{p}\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\beta_{p} \\sin\\theta $$\n$$ \\langle p_{y} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{E,a} \\rangle = \\frac{\\beta_{p}\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{6}} [2(0) - 1(\\sqrt{3}/2) - 1(-\\sqrt{3}/2)] = 0 $$\n$$ \\langle p_{x} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{E,b} \\rangle = \\frac{\\beta_{p}\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} [(-1/2) - (-1/2)] = 0 $$\n$$ \\langle p_{y} | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_{E,b} \\rangle = \\frac{\\beta_{p}\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} [(\\sqrt{3}/2) - (-\\sqrt{3}/2)] = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\beta_{p}\\sin\\theta}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\beta_{p} \\sin\\theta $$\nThe total squared coupling for the $e$ block is the sum of the squares of these four matrix elements:\n$$ S_{e}^{2} = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\beta_{p} \\sin\\theta\\right)^{2} + 0^{2} + 0^{2} + \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\beta_{p} \\sin\\theta\\right)^{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\\beta_{p}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta + \\frac{3}{2}\\beta_{p}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta = 3\\beta_{p}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta $$\n\nThe total squared coupling to the $p$-orbital manifold is the sum of the contributions from each symmetry block:\n$$ S_{\\text{total}}^{2} = S_{a_{1}}^{2} + S_{e}^{2} = 3\\beta_{p}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta + 3\\beta_{p}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta = 3\\beta_{p}^{2}(\\cos^{2}\\theta + \\sin^{2}\\theta) = 3\\beta_{p}^{2} $$\nThe total coupling is constant, independent of the angle $\\theta$, reflecting the rotational invariance of the complete $p$-orbital manifold.\n\nThe fraction $f(\\theta)$ of the total squared coupling that resides in the $a_{1}$ symmetry block is the ratio of the $a_{1}$ squared coupling to the total squared coupling:\n$$ f(\\theta) = \\frac{S_{a_{1}}^{2}}{S_{\\text{total}}^{2}} = \\frac{3\\beta_{p}^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta}{3\\beta_{p}^{2}} = \\cos^{2}\\theta $$\n\nThis result correctly predicts that for a planar molecule ($\\theta=\\pi/2$), $f(\\pi/2)=0$, meaning there is no coupling of H $1s$ orbitals to the $p_z$ orbital, which is consistent with our $D_{3h}$ analysis.

It is a valid problem.

They will have analogous MO diagrams and occupations. With $8$ electrons, four MOs will be occupied.\n\n2.  **Walsh Diagram Analysis for an $\\mathrm{XH_3}$ System:**\n    The geometry of an $\\mathrm{XH_3}$ molecule is determined by the total energy, which is the sum of the energies of the occupied molecular orbitals. The preference for planar ($\\mathrm{D_{3h}}$) versus pyramidal ($\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$) geometry depends on how the energies of these four occupied MOs change with the H-X-H bond angle.\n    *   In the planar $\\mathrm{D_{3h}}$ geometry, the four occupied MOs, in increasing order of energy, are a bonding $1a_1'$ MO, a degenerate pair of bonding $1e'$ MOs, and a non-bonding $a_2''$ MO. The electronic configuration is $(1a_1')^2(1e')^4(a_2'')^2$. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is the $a_2''$ MO, which is essentially the pure $p_z$ atomic orbital of the central atom X, as it has no matching symmetry among the hydrogen SALCs (Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations).\n    *   Upon pyramidalization (bending towards $\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$ symmetry), the orbital symmetries change. The $a_1'$ and $a_2''$ orbitals of $\\mathrm{D_{3h}}$ both correlate to $a_1$ orbitals in $\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$, while the $e'$ pair correlates to an $e$ pair.\n    *   As stated in the problem, in $\\mathrm{C_{3v}}$ symmetry, the central atom's $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals both have $a_1$ symmetry. This allows the MOs derived from them to mix. The HOMO of the planar form (the $a_2''$ or $p_z$ orbital) and the lowest-energy MO (the $1a_1'$ or $s$-based orbital) now interact.\n    *   According to perturbation theory, this mixing causes the lower energy orbital to decrease in energy and the higher energy orbital to increase. However, in the context of Walsh diagrams, the critical change is that the HOMO ($a_2'' \\rightarrow 2a_1$) gains $s$-character from the lower $1a_1$ orbital and becomes bonding with the hydrogen orbitals, causing its energy to drop significantly upon bending. This stabilization of the doubly occupied HOMO is the primary driving force for the pyramidal geometry of 8-electron $\\mathrm{XH_3}$ systems. Thus, both $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ are predicted to be pyramidal.\n\n3.  **Comparison of Inversion Barriers:**\n    The inversion barrier is the energy difference between the planar transition state ($E_{plan}$) and the pyramidal ground state ($E_{pyr}$), i.e., $E_{barrier} = E_{plan} - E_{pyr}$. The magnitude of this barrier is directly related to the amount of stabilization gained upon pyramidalization.\n    *   The key stabilizing interaction is the mixing of the $s$- and $p_z$-derived $a_1$ MOs. The strength of this orbital mixing is inversely proportional to their energy separation.\n    *   As per assumption (iv), the energy stabilization scales as $-V^2/\\Delta E_{orbitals}$. The energy gap between the interacting MOs, $\\Delta E_{orbitals}$, is dominated by the energy gap of the parent atomic orbitals, $\\Delta_{sp} = \\varepsilon(p) - \\varepsilon(s)$.\n    *   We are given in assumption (iii) that the atomic $s-p$ gap is smaller for carbon than for nitrogen: $\\Delta_{sp}(\\mathrm{C}) < \\Delta_{sp}(\\mathrm{N})$.\n    *   A smaller energy denominator, $\\Delta_{sp}$, leads to a larger stabilization energy upon mixing. Therefore, the stabilization of the HOMO upon bending from planar to pyramidal is greater for $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ than for $\\mathrm{NH_3}$.\n    *   A greater stabilization upon bending means that the energy of the pyramidal minimum, $E_{pyr}$, is lowered more significantly relative to the planar energy, $E_{plan}$, in $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ compared to $\\mathrm{NH_3}$.\n    *   Consequently, the inversion barrier, $E_{plan} - E_{pyr}$, is predicted to be substantially larger for $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ than for $\\mathrm{NH_3}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ is pyramidal because bending allows $a_1(2s)$–$a_1(2p_z)$ mixing that strongly stabilizes the lone-pair $a_1$ MO; since $\\Delta_{sp}(\\mathrm{C})<\\Delta_{sp}(\\mathrm{N})$, this stabilization is larger in $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ than in $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, making the planar geometry higher relative to the minimum and thus the inversion barrier of $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ substantially larger than that of $\\mathrm{NH_3}$.**\n    This option correctly identifies that pyramidality is due to the stabilization of the lone-pair MO via $s-p$ mixing. It correctly uses the provided information that $\\Delta_{sp}(\\mathrm{C}) < \\Delta_{sp}(\\mathrm{N})$ to deduce that this stabilization is greater in $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$. It correctly concludes that this leads to a larger inversion barrier for $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$. This statement is entirely consistent with the derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ is planar because filling the degenerate $e'$ set in $\\mathrm{D_{3h}}$ maximizes delocalization; the inversion barrier is therefore lower than in $\\mathrm{NH_3}$.**\n    This is incorrect. $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ is an 8-electron system, which favors a pyramidal geometry due to the stabilization of the highest-occupied $a_1$ orbital (correlating with $a_2''$ in $\\mathrm{D_{3h}}$), not a planar one. 6-electron systems (e.g., $\\mathrm{BH_3}$) are planar. The reasoning is flawed.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Both $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ and $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ have similar inversion barriers because Walsh curves depend almost exclusively on $\\mathrm{H{-}H}$ repulsion, which is nearly identical in both molecules.**\n    This is incorrect. The dominant factor in the Walsh diagram for this geometry change is electronic stabilization of the HOMO, not simply steric H-H repulsion. The electronic properties of the central atom (C vs. N) are different and, as shown, lead to a significant difference in the inversion barrier.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ is pyramidal, but the inversion barrier is smaller than in $\\mathrm{NH_3}$ because the extra electron density in $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ suppresses $s$–$p$ mixing upon bending.**\n    This is incorrect. The conclusion that the barrier is smaller contradicts the derivation. The reasoning provided is also flawed; the lower nuclear charge of carbon, which is related to the \"extra electron density\" being more diffuse, leads to a *smaller* $\\Delta_{sp}$ gap, which *enhances* $s-p$ mixing, rather than suppressing it.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. $\\mathrm{CH_3^-}$ is pyramidal and has a higher inversion barrier than $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, but this is because the $e$ bonding set is greatly stabilized upon bending while the $a_1$ lone-pair energy is nearly unchanged.**\n    This is incorrect. While it correctly states that the barrier is higher, the reason is wrong. The primary effect is the strong stabilization of the $a_1$ lone-pair MO upon bending.
