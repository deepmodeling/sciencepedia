It is a well-posed problem in classical mechanics and physical chemistry, grounded in the standard theoretical framework of reaction dynamics on a potential energy surface. All terms are clearly defined, and sufficient information is provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe potential energy surface, $V(q)$, is given by the one-dimensional quartic function:\n$$V(q) = a q^{4} - b q^{2}$$\nwhere $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. The parameters ensure a symmetric double-well potential, with two minima separated by a barrier.\n\nFirst, we must identify the stationary points of the potential. Stationary points are locations where the force, and thus the gradient of the potential, is zero. We compute the first derivative of $V(q)$ with respect to the reaction coordinate $q$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dq} = \\frac{d}{dq}(a q^{4} - b q^{2}) = 4 a q^{3} - 2 b q$$\nSetting $\\frac{dV}{dq} = 0$:\n$$4 a q^{3} - 2 b q = 0$$\n$$2q(2aq^2 - b) = 0$$\nThis equation yields three solutions for the coordinates of the stationary points:\n$$q = 0$$\nand\n$$q^{2} = \\frac{b}{2a} \\implies q = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{2a}}$$\n\nNext, we must distinguish between minima (stable states) and the transition state (saddle point) by examining the curvature of the potential at these stationary points.

Therefore, the trace is negative:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{H}(P_2)) < 0\n$$\nSince the trace (sum of eigenvalues) is negative and the determinant (product of eigenvalues) is positive, both eigenvalues must be negative. This means $P_2$ is a local maximum (an index-$2$ stationary point).\n\nThe problem defines the transition state as an index-$1$ saddle point. Our analysis shows that only $P_1 = (0,0)$ fits this definition. Therefore, the transition state is located at the origin.\n\nThe final task is to find the reaction-coordinate curvature, which is defined as the negative eigenvalue of the Hessian at the transition state.

The final reported answer is specified to be only the expression for the curvature $\\kappa(x)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the equation of the MEP, denoted $y_{\\mathrm{MEP}}(x)$. The potential energy surface is given by:\n$$V(x,y) = V_{0}(x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\omega^{2}\\,\\big(y-c\\,x^{2}\\big)^{2}$$\nThe MEP is defined as the path that minimizes $V(x,y)$ with respect to the transverse coordinate $y$ for each value of the reaction coordinate $x$.

Applying the chain rule to the second term gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\omega^{2} \\cdot 2\\big(y-c\\,x^{2}\\big)^{1} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big(y-c\\,x^{2}\\big) = \\omega^{2}\\big(y-c\\,x^{2}\\big)$$\nSetting this derivative to zero yields the condition for the MEP:\n$$\\omega^{2}\\big(y-c\\,x^{2}\\big) = 0$$\nGiven that the transverse frequency $\\omega > 0$, its square $\\omega^2$ must also be positive. Thus, the expression in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$y - c\\,x^{2} = 0$$\n$$y = c\\,x^{2}$$\nThis equation defines the MEP. We will denote it as $y_{\\mathrm{MEP}}(x) = c\\,x^{2}$. To confirm this corresponds to a minimum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ \\omega^{2}\\big(y-c\\,x^{2}\\big) \\right] = \\omega^{2}$$\nSince $\\omega^{2} > 0$, the path $y_{\\mathrm{MEP}}(x) = c\\,x^{2}$ is indeed a locus of minima along the $y$ direction.\n\nSecond, we derive the curvature $\\kappa(x)$ of the MEP. The MEP is a planar curve described by the function $f(x) = c\\,x^{2}$. The curvature $\\kappa(x)$ of a curve defined by a function $y=f(x)$ is given by the standard formula from differential geometry:\n$$\\kappa(x) = \\frac{|f''(x)|}{\\left(1 + [f'(x)]^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}$$\nWe must calculate the first and second derivatives of $f(x)$:\nThe first derivative is:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(c\\,x^{2}\\right) = 2cx$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2cx) = 2c$$\nNow, we substitute these derivatives into the curvature formula. The numerator is $|f''(x)| = |2c| = 2|c|$. The term $[f'(x)]^2$ in the denominator is $(2cx)^2 = 4c^2x^2$.\nSubstituting these expressions yields the curvature of the MEP:\n$$\\kappa(x) = \\frac{2|c|}{\\left(1 + 4c^{2}x^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}$$\nThis is the required explicit analytic expression for the curvature of the Minimum Energy Path as a function of the reaction coordinate $x$ and the constant $c$.\n\nThird, we discuss the corner-cutting tendency of quantum tunneling paths. A tunneling path, or instanton, is the path that minimizes the Euclidean action, $S_{\\mathrm{E}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{E}}=\\int \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\dot{x}^{2}+\\dot{y}^{2}\\right)+V(x,y)\\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau$$\nThe total action is an integral over two competing contributions: a kinetic energy term $\\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{x}^2+\\dot{y}^2)$, which is related to the path length, and a potential energy term $V(x,y)$. The MEP, $y=cx^2$, is by definition the path of lowest potential energy. However, it is a curved path. The kinetic term can be reduced by choosing a shorter path, i.e., \"cutting the corner\" of the MEP. The optimal tunneling path is a compromise that minimizes the sum of these effects.\nThe corner-cutting tendency is driven by the curvature of the MEP, $\\kappa(x)$. A larger curvature implies a more sharply bent path, making the potential savings in path length from cutting the corner more significant. Therefore, the tendency to corner-cut increases with $\\kappa(x)$. This effect is most pronounced where $\\kappa(x)$ is maximal, which for this MEP occurs at $x=0$, where $\\kappa(0) = 2|c|$.\nConversely, the adiabatic limit corresponds to a large transverse frequency, $\\omega \\gg 0$. The potential energy away from the MEP is $V-V_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2(y-cx^2)^2$. A large $\\omega$ creates a very steep potential wall on either side of the MEP, imposing a severe energetic penalty on any path that deviates from it. Consequently, in the adiabatic limit, the tunneling path is forced to lie very close to the MEP, and the corner-cutting effect is suppressed. The deviation from the MEP, and thus the extent of corner-cutting, scales inversely with $\\omega$. In summary, the corner-cutting tendency scales directly with the curvature $\\kappa(x)$ and inversely with the transverse frequency $\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2|c|}{\\left(1 + 4c^{2}x^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}}$$", "id": "2661546"}]}
