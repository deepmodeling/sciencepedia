We will proceed from fundamental principles.\n\nAn electronic transition from an initial state $\\psi_i$ to a final state $\\psi_f$ is governed by the transition moment integral, $M_{\\alpha}$, within the electric dipole approximation. This integral is given by:\n$$\nM_{\\alpha} = \\int \\psi_f^* \\hat{\\mu}_{\\alpha} \\psi_i \\,d\\tau\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mu}_{\\alpha}$ is the component of the electric dipole operator along the axis $\\alpha \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$, and the integration is over all spatial coordinates. The transition is \"allowed\" if this integral is non-zero.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the molecule commutes with all symmetry operations $R$ of its point group. Consequently, the wavefunctions $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_f$ must serve as bases for the irreducible representations (irreps) of the group. Let $\\Gamma_i$ be the irrep corresponding to $\\psi_i$ and $\\Gamma_f$ be the irrep for $\\psi_f$. Similarly, the operator component $\\hat{\\mu}_{\\alpha}$ transforms according to an irrep $\\Gamma_{\\mu_{\\alpha}}$.\n\nThe transition moment integral $M_{\\alpha}$ is a scalar quantity, and thus it must be invariant under all symmetry operations of the group. This is only possible if the integrand, $\\psi_f^* \\hat{\\mu}_{\\alpha} \\psi_i$, transforms as the totally symmetric irreducible representation of the group, which for $C_{2v}$ is denoted $A_1$. The representation of a product of functions is the direct product of their individual representations. Assuming the wavefunctions are real, the representation of $\\psi_f^*$ is the same as that of $\\psi_f$. Therefore, the condition for a non-zero integral is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_f \\otimes \\Gamma_{\\mu_{\\alpha}} \\otimes \\Gamma_i \\supset A_1\n$$\nThis means that the direct product of the three representations must contain the totally symmetric representation $A_1$. Since all irreps of the $C_{2v}$ group are one-dimensional, the direct product of any two irreps yields another single irrep. The above condition simplifies. Multiplying by $\\Gamma_f$ from the left and using the property that $\\Gamma_f \\otimes \\Gamma_f = A_1$ for any one-dimensional irrep, we obtain:\n$$\nA_1 \\otimes \\Gamma_{\\mu_{\\alpha}} \\otimes \\Gamma_i \\supset \\Gamma_f\n$$\nSince $A_1$ is the identity element for the direct product, this simplifies to the central selection rule:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\mu_{\\alpha}} \\otimes \\Gamma_i \\supset \\Gamma_f\n$$\nFor one-dimensional irreps, this becomes an equality:\n$$\n\\Gamma_f = \\Gamma_{\\mu_{\\alpha}} \\otimes \\Gamma_i\n$$\n\nWe must now execute the specific tasks outlined.\n\n1) Classification of the transformations of $x$, $y$, and $z$:\nThe symmetry operations for $C_{2v}$ are $E$, $C_2(z)$, $\\sigma_v(xz)$, and $\\sigma_v'(yz)$. We analyze the transformation of the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ under these operations:\n- $E(x,y,z) = (x,y,z)$\n- $C_2(z)(x,y,z) = (-x,-y,z)$\n- $\\sigma_v(xz)(x,y,z) = (x,-y,z)$\n- $\\sigma_v'(yz)(x,y,z) = (-x,y,z)$\n\nFrom these transformations, we can determine the characters for the representations based on each coordinate, which correspond to the transformation of the dipole operator components $(\\mu_x, \\mu_y, \\mu_z)$.\n\n- For $z$: The coordinate $z$ is unchanged by any operation. The character for each operation is $1$. The character vector is $(\\chi(E), \\chi(C_2), \\chi(\\sigma_v), \\chi(\\sigma_v')) = (1,1,1,1)$. This corresponds to the totally symmetric irrep, $A_1$. Thus, $\\Gamma_{\\mu_z} = A_1$.\n\n- For $x$: The coordinate $x$ is unchanged by $E$ and $\\sigma_v(xz)$, but its sign is inverted by $C_2(z)$ and $\\sigma_v'(yz)$. The character vector is $(1,-1,1,-1)$. This corresponds to the $B_1$ irrep. Thus, $\\Gamma_{\\mu_x} = B_1$.\n\n- For $y$: The coordinate $y$ is unchanged by $E$ and $\\sigma_v'(yz)$, but its sign is inverted by $C_2(z)$ and $\\sigma_v(xz)$.

Since $A_2 \\neq B_2$, the triplet $(A_2, x, B_2)$ is allowed.\n    - If $\\Gamma_i = B_1$, then $\\Gamma_f = B_1 \\otimes B_1 = A_1$. Since $B_1 \\neq A_1$, the triplet $(B_1, x, A_1)$ is allowed.\n    - If $\\Gamma_i = B_2$, then $\\Gamma_f = B_1 \\otimes B_2 = A_2$. Since $B_2 \\neq A_2$, the triplet $(B_2, x, A_2)$ is allowed.\nIn all cases, $\\Gamma_f \\neq \\Gamma_i$. Thus, there are $4$ allowed triplets for x-polarization.\n\n- **y-polarization ($\\alpha = y$):** Here, $\\Gamma_{\\mu_y} = B_2$. The selection rule is $\\Gamma_f = B_2 \\otimes \\Gamma_i$. We check each possible $\\Gamma_i$:\n    - If $\\Gamma_i = A_1$, then $\\Gamma_f = B_2 \\otimes A_1 = B_2$.

Since $A_2 \\neq B_1$, the triplet $(A_2, y, B_1)$ is allowed.\n    - If $\\Gamma_i = B_1$, then $\\Gamma_f = B_2 \\otimes B_1 = A_2$.

For this system, MOs with an even number of nodes ($0, 2$) belong to one symmetry type, and those with an odd number of nodes ($1, 3$) belong to the other. Let's analyze the symmetry of the lowest-energy MO, $\\psi_1 \\approx \\phi_1+\\phi_2+\\phi_3+\\phi_4$. Under the $C_2(z)$ operation, $\\hat{C}_2(z) \\psi_1 = \\phi_4+\\phi_3+\\phi_2+\\phi_1 = \\psi_1$. An eigenvalue of $+1$ for $C_2(z)$ corresponds to the $B_{1u}$ irrep (given that the only other option is $B_{2g}$, which has character -1). Thus, orbitals with an even number of nodes have $B_{1u}$ symmetry. Orbitals with an odd number of nodes must have $B_{2g}$ symmetry.\n\nThe energy-ordered MOs with their symmetries are:\n-   $\\psi_1$ (0 nodes): $B_{1u}$ (bonding)\n-   $\\psi_2$ (1 node): $B_{2g}$ (bonding)\n-   $\\psi_3$ (2 nodes): $B_{1u}$ (antibonding, $\\pi^{\\ast}$)\n-   $\\psi_4$ (3 nodes): $B_{2g}$ (antibonding, $\\pi^{\\ast}$)\n\nButadiene has 4 $\\pi$ electrons, which occupy the two lowest-energy MOs in the ground state.\n-   Occupied orbitals: $\\{\\psi_1(B_{1u}), \\psi_2(B_{2g})\\}$. These are the HOMO-1 and HOMO, respectively.\n-   Unoccupied (virtual) orbitals: $\\{\\psi_3(B_{1u}), \\psi_4(B_{2g})\\}$. These are the LUMO and LUMO+1, respectively.\nThe ground state electronic configuration is $(\\psi_1)^2 (\\psi_2)^2$. Its total symmetry is $B_{1u} \\otimes B_{1u} \\otimes B_{2g} \\otimes B_{2g} = A_g \\otimes A_g = A_g$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nStep 4: Apply the electric-dipole selection rule\nThe selection rule states that a transition is allowed if $\\Gamma_i \\otimes \\Gamma(\\mu_k) \\otimes \\Gamma_f$ contains $A_g$. Since the initial state symmetry $\\Gamma_i = A_g$, this simplifies to the requirement that $\\Gamma(\\mu_k) \\otimes \\Gamma_f$ contains $A_g$. This is only true if $\\Gamma_f = \\Gamma(\\mu_k)$.\n\nThe symmetry of the final excited state, $\\Gamma_f$, resulting from a one-electron excitation from an occupied orbital $\\psi_o$ to a virtual orbital $\\psi_v$, is given by $\\Gamma_f = \\Gamma(\\psi_o) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi_v)$.

Your final answer must be a single expression. If you choose to simplify trigonometric combinations, you must provide an exact expression. Angles are in radians. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, solvable problem in the field of theoretical spectroscopy. The provided information is complete and consistent, and the required task is unambiguous. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Raman scattering intensity, $I$, which is proportional to the squared modulus of the scattering amplitude, $A$. The amplitude is given by the expression $A = \\mathbf{e}_{s}^{\\top}\\,\\mathbf{R}\\,\\mathbf{e}_{i}$, where $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_{s}$ are the polarization vectors for the incident and scattered light, respectively, and $\\mathbf{R}$ is the Raman tensor of the vibrational mode.\n\nFirst, we must define the polarization vectors in the specified crystallographic coordinate system. The incident light has its polarization vector $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$ in the $xy$-plane, at an angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the $x$-axis. The scattered light has its polarization vector $\\mathbf{e}_{s}$ also in the $xy$-plane, at an angle $\\beta$ with respect to the $x$-axis. In a Cartesian basis $(\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{z}})$, these unit vectors are represented as column vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_{i} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\ \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\mathbf{e}_{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\beta) \\\\ \\sin(\\beta) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe transpose of the scattered polarization vector, $\\mathbf{e}_{s}^{\\top}$, is the row vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_{s}^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\beta) & \\sin(\\beta) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies the Raman tensor for a $B_{2g}$ symmetry mode in the $D_{4h}$ point group, which is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{R}(B_{2g}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & d & 0\\\\\nd & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $d$ is a real constant representing the magnitude of the polarizability derivative.\n\nThe calculation of the scattering amplitude $A$ proceeds in two steps. First, we compute the product of the Raman tensor $\\mathbf{R}$ and the incident polarization vector $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}\\,\\mathbf{e}_{i} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & d & 0\\\\\nd & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n\\sin(\\alpha) \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n(0)(\\cos(\\alpha)) + (d)(\\sin(\\alpha)) + (0)(0) \\\\\n(d)(\\cos(\\alpha)) + (0)(\\sin(\\alpha)) + (0)(0) \\\\\n(0)(\\cos(\\alpha)) + (0)(\\sin(\\alpha)) + (0)(0)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\nd \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\\nd \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we pre-multiply this resulting vector by the transposed scattered polarization vector $\\mathbf{e}_{s}^{\\top}$ to obtain the scalar amplitude $A$:\n$$\nA = \\mathbf{e}_{s}^{\\top} (\\mathbf{R}\\,\\mathbf{e}_{i}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\beta) & \\sin(\\beta) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nd \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\\nd \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA = \\cos(\\beta) \\cdot (d \\sin(\\alpha)) + \\sin(\\beta) \\cdot (d \\cos(\\alpha))\n$$\nFactoring out the constant $d$, we have:\n$$\nA = d (\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta))\n$$\nThis expression is simplified using the trigonometric sum identity for sine, $\\sin(x+y) = \\sin(x)\\cos(y) + \\cos(x)\\sin(y)$. Applying this identity, the amplitude becomes:\n$$\nA = d \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)\n$$\n\nThe Raman intensity $I$ is proportional to the squared modulus of the amplitude, $I \\propto |A|^2$. Since $d$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ are real quantities, the amplitude $A$ is also real. The intensity, up to a constant prefactor that depends on instrumental factors and incident power, is thus given by:\n$$\nI(\\alpha, \\beta) = A^2 = (d \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta))^2\n$$\nThis yields the final expression for the angular dependence of the Raman intensity for the $B_{2g}$ mode.\n$$\nI(\\alpha, \\beta) = d^{2} \\sin^{2}(\\alpha + \\beta)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{d^{2} \\sin^{2}(\\alpha + \\beta)}\n$$", "id": "2810210"}]}
