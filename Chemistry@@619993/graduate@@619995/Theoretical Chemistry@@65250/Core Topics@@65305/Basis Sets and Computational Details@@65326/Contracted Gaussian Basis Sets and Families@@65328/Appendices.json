No rounding instruction is needed because the result is exact.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the change in the number of basis functions when upgrading the basis set for the molecule $\\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$ from $6$-$31$G to $6$-$31$G$(d)$. The solution must adhere to the provided definitions and the pure (spherical-harmonic) representation of angular functions.\n\nFirst, the atoms constituting the molecule $\\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$ must be identified. The molecule consists of one phosphorus atom ($\\mathrm{P}$) and three chlorine atoms ($\\mathrm{Cl}$).\n\nThe problem defines “second-row elements” as the third-period elements from sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}$) to argon ($\\mathrm{Ar}$). We must determine if $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}$ fall into this category.\nThe phosphorus atom ($\\mathrm{P}$) has an atomic number $Z=15$. Its ground-state electron configuration is $[\\mathrm{Ne}] \\, 3s^2 3p^3$. The principal quantum number of the valence shell is $n=3$, placing it in the third period of the periodic table. Thus, $\\mathrm{P}$ is a “second-row element” according to the problem's definition.\nThe chlorine atom ($\\mathrm{Cl}$) has an atomic number $Z=17$. Its ground-state electron configuration is $[\\mathrm{Ne}] \\, 3s^2 3p^5$. The principal quantum number of its valence shell is also $n=3$, placing it in the third period. Thus, $\\mathrm{Cl}$ is also a “second-row element”.\n\nThe basis set notation $6$-$31$G$(d)$ indicates that a single polarization shell is added to each designated atom. The problem states that the designated atoms are the “second-row elements” and that the polarization shell has the next higher angular momentum relative to the occupied valence shell.\n\nFor both phosphorus and chlorine, the valence electrons occupy the $3s$ and $3p$ subshells. The angular momentum quantum number, $l$, for an $s$-orbital is $l=0$, and for a $p$-orbital is $l=1$. The highest angular momentum quantum number for an occupied valence orbital in both $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}$ is therefore $l_{max} = 1$.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, the added polarization shell will have an angular momentum quantum number $l_{pol}$ given by:\n$$l_{pol} = l_{max} + 1$$\nSubstituting the value of $l_{max}$:\n$$l_{pol} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\nAn angular momentum quantum number of $l=2$ corresponds to a shell of $d$-type orbitals. Thus, for each of the “second-row atoms” in $\\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$ (which are all atoms in the molecule, namely one $\\mathrm{P}$ and three $\\mathrm{Cl}$), a shell of $d$-functions is added. This addresses the first task of enumerating the polarization shells.\n\nNext, we must compute the total increase in the number of contracted basis functions. The problem specifies the use of the pure (spherical-harmonic) representation. For a given angular momentum quantum number $l$, there are $2l+1$ independent spherical harmonic functions, corresponding to the magnetic quantum numbers $m_l$ ranging from $-l$ to $+l$.\n\nFor the added $d$-shell, $l=2$. The number of basis functions in this shell is:\n$$N_d = 2l_{pol} + 1 = 2(2) + 1 = 5$$\nThese five functions are conventionally denoted as $d_{z^2}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{xy}$, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$.\n\nThe $6$-$31$G$(d)$ basis set adds one such shell of $5$ functions to each specified atom. In $\\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$, this applies to the one phosphorus atom and the three chlorine atoms.\nThe total increase in the number of basis functions, $\\Delta N_{basis}$, is the sum of the functions added to each atom.\n-   Increase for the single $\\mathrm{P}$ atom: $1 \\times (2(2)+1) = 5$ functions.\n-   Increase for the three $\\mathrm{Cl}$ atoms: $3 \\times (2(2)+1) = 3 \\times 5 = 15$ functions.\n\nThe total increase for the entire $\\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$ molecule is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\\Delta N_{basis} = 5 + 15 = 20$$\nTherefore, upgrading the basis set from $6$-$31$G to $6$-$31$G$(d)$ for $\\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$ results in an increase of $20$ contracted basis functions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "2766236"}, {"introduction": "When we calculate the interaction energy between two or more molecules, the finite nature of our basis sets introduces a subtle but significant artifact known as Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE). This exercise immerses you in the widely used counterpoise (CP) correction method developed by Boys and Bernardi, which is designed to estimate and remove this error [@problem_id:2766248]. By processing a set of hypothetical energy calculations for a water dimer, you will quantify the magnitude of BSSE and appreciate why CP correction is a critical step for achieving physically meaningful results in studies of non-covalent interactions.", "problem": "Consider the Born–Oppenheimer electronic energy of the water dimer described with split-valence contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. A contracted Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions and is commonly organized into families such as split-valence sets where the valence space is represented by multiple contracted functions of differing radial extents. Due to the variational principle, adding basis functions lowers the computed total energy, which leads to basis set superposition error (BSSE) when two monomers share each other’s basis in a dimer calculation. The Boys–Bernardi counterpoise (CP) procedure mitigates this by recomputing each monomer in the full dimer basis using ghost functions on the partner.\n\nYou are given, for each test case, five total electronic energies in Hartree (atomic units): the dimer energy $E_{AB}$, the isolated monomer energies $E_A$ and $E_B$ each in its own basis, and the monomer-in-dimer-basis energies $E_A^{AB}$ and $E_B^{AB}$ where each monomer is computed in the full dimer basis with ghost functions on the partner.

All final values must be expressed in kilojoules per mole ($\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$), rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThe provided input energies for each case are the dimer total energy $E_{AB}$, the isolated monomer energies $E_A$ and $E_B$ in their respective bases, and the monomer energies $E_A^{AB}$ and $E_B^{AB}$ computed in the full dimer basis set. All energies are given in the atomic unit of Hartree ($E_h$).\n\nThe governing formulas, derived from the problem statement, are as follows:\n\n1.  The uncorrected interaction energy, $E_{\\text{int, uncorr}}$, is the simple difference between the energy of the supersystem (the dimer $AB$) and the sum of the energies of its isolated subsystems (monomers $A$ and $B$).\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{int, uncorr}} = E_{AB} - (E_A + E_B)\n    $$\n\n2.  The counterpoise-corrected interaction energy, $E_{\\text{int, CP}}$, accounts for the basis set superposition error (BSSE). The BSSE arises because in a dimer calculation, monomer $A$ can \"borrow\" basis functions from monomer $B$, and vice versa, leading to an artificial, non-physical lowering of each monomer's energy compared to its truly isolated state. The Boys–Bernardi counterpoise procedure corrects for this by calculating each monomer's energy in the full dimer basis. This provides the reference energies $E_A^{AB}$ and $E_B^{AB}$. The corrected interaction energy is then:\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{int, CP}} = E_{AB} - (E_A^{AB} + E_B^{AB})\n    $$\n    By the variational principle, using a larger basis set must yield an energy that is lower than or equal to the energy from a smaller basis set. Thus, $E_A^{AB} \\le E_A$ and $E_B^{AB} \\le E_B$. This implies that the CP correction will make the interaction energy less attractive (i.e., $E_{\\text{int, CP}} \\ge E_{\\text{int, uncorr}}$ if interaction is attractive).\n\n3.  The magnitude of the basis set superposition error, $E_{\\text{BSSE}}$, is defined as the absolute difference between the uncorrected and CP-corrected interaction energies.\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{BSSE}} = |E_{\\text{int, uncorr}} - E_{\\text{int, CP}}|\n    $$\n    Substituting the definitions for the interaction energies, this simplifies to:\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{BSSE}} = |(E_{AB} - (E_A + E_B)) - (E_{AB} - (E_A^{AB} + E_B^{AB}))| = |(E_A^{AB} - E_A) + (E_B^{AB} - E_B)|\n    $$\n    Since $E_A^{AB} \\le E_A$ and $E_B^{AB} \\le E_B$, the term inside the absolute value is non-positive. The BSSE is therefore the sum of the artificial stabilization energies of the monomers:\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{BSSE}} = (E_A - E_A^{AB}) + (E_B - E_B^{AB})\n    $$\n\nThe conversion from Hartree to kilojoules per mole is performed using the provided factor: $1\\ E_h = 2625.499638\\ \\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$.

Subtracting equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$ yields:\n$$E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - E_{\\text{corr}}(3) = \\left( E_{\\infty} + \\frac{A}{4^3} \\right) - \\left( E_{\\infty} + \\frac{A}{3^3} \\right) = A \\left( \\frac{1}{64} - \\frac{1}{27} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - E_{\\text{corr}}(3) = A \\left( \\frac{27 - 64}{1728} \\right) = A \\left( \\frac{-37}{1728} \\right)$$\nFrom this, we can express $A$ as:\n$$A = -\\frac{1728}{37} \\left( E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - E_{\\text{corr}}(3) \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $A$ back into equation $(2)$ to isolate $E_{\\infty}$:\n$$E_{\\infty} = E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - \\frac{A}{4^3} = E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - \\frac{A}{64}$$\n$$E_{\\infty} = E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - \\frac{1}{64} \\left[ -\\frac{1728}{37} \\left( E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - E_{\\text{corr}}(3) \\right) \\right]$$\nThe numerical constants simplify, as $1728 = 27 \\times 64$:\n$$E_{\\infty} = E_{\\text{corr}}(4) + \\frac{27}{37} \\left( E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - E_{\\text{corr}}(3) \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms to obtain a final expression for $E_{\\infty}$:\n$$E_{\\infty} = \\frac{37 E_{\\text{corr}}(4) + 27 E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - 27 E_{\\text{corr}}(3)}{37}$$\n$$E_{\\infty} = \\frac{64 E_{\\text{corr}}(4) - 27 E_{\\text{corr}}(3)}{37}$$\nThis is the explicit two-point extrapolation formula derived from first principles for the cardinal numbers $n=3$ and $n=4$.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the given data:\n$$E_{\\text{corr}}(3) = -0.331000\\,\\text{E}_{\\text{h}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{corr}}(4) = -0.346000\\,\\text{E}_{\\text{h}}$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$E_{\\infty} = \\frac{64(-0.346000) - 27(-0.331000)}{37}$$\n$$E_{\\infty} = \\frac{-22.144000 + 8.937000}{37} = \\frac{-13.207000}{37} \\approx -0.356945946\\,\\text{E}_{\\text{h}}$$\nThe problem asks for an error bar, defined as the magnitude of the difference between the extrapolated CBS limit and the cc-pVQZ energy:\n$$\\text{Error Bar} = |E_{\\infty} - E_{\\text{corr}}(4)|$$\n$$\\text{Error Bar} = |-0.356945946 - (-0.346000)| \\, \\text{E}_{\\text{h}}$$\n$$\\text{Error Bar} = |-0.010945946| \\, \\text{E}_{\\text{h}} = 0.010945946 \\, \\text{E}_{\\text{h}}$$\nThe final step is to convert this result to millihartree ($\\text{mE}_{\\text{h}}$) and round to four significant figures. Since $1\\,\\text{E}_{\\text{h}} = 1000\\,\\text{mE}_{\\text{h}}$:\n$$\\text{Error Bar} = 0.010945946 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mE}_{\\text{h}} = 10.945946 \\, \\text{mE}_{\\text{h}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $10.95\\,\\text{mE}_{\\text{h}}$. This value represents an estimate of the remaining basis set incompleteness error in the cc-pVQZ correlation energy.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{10.95} $$", "id": "2766349"}]}
