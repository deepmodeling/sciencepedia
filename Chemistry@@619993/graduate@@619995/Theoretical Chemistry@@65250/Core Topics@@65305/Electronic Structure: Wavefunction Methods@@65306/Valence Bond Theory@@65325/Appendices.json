A hybrid orbital $h_i$ is a linear combination of the given orthonormal atomic orbitals $\\{s, p_x, p_y, p_z\\}$:\n$$ h_i = a_i s + b_i p_x + c_i p_y + d_i p_z $$\nThe set of p-orbital coefficients can be represented as a vector $\\mathbf{v}_i = (b_i, c_i, d_i)$.

These vectors are normalized. The inner product between any two distinct vectors is, for example, $\\mathbf{n}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_2 = \\frac{1}{3}(1-1-1) = -\\frac{1}{3}$. This holds for any $i \\neq j$.\nBy tetrahedral symmetry, we set $a_i^2 = a^2$ and $\\beta_i^2 = \\beta^2$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\nThe normalization condition for any hybrid ($i=j$) is:\n$$ a^2 + \\beta^2 (\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_i) = 1 \\implies a^2 + \\beta^2 = 1 $$\nThe orthogonality condition for any pair of distinct hybrids ($i \\neq j$) is:\n$$ a^2 + \\beta^2 (\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_j) = 0 \\implies a^2 + \\beta^2(-\\frac{1}{3}) = 0 \\implies a^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\beta^2 $$\nWe solve the system:\n1. $a^2 + \\beta^2 = 1$\n2. $a^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\beta^2 \\implies \\beta^2 = 3a^2$\nSubstituting (2) into (1) gives $a^2 + 3a^2 = 1$, so $4a^2 = 1$.\nThe $s$-character for an $sp^3$ hybrid is $a^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Calculation of $Q$**\nThe problem asks for the quantity $Q$, defined as the product of the $s$-character fractions for each hybridization family.\n- $s$-character fraction for $sp$: $s_{sp} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $s$-character fraction for $sp^2$: $s_{sp^2} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $s$-character fraction for $sp^3$: $s_{sp^3} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe product is:\n$$ Q = s_{sp} \\times s_{sp^2} \\times s_{sp^3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{24} $$\nThe final result is an exact fraction as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}$$", "id": "2963149"}, {"introduction": "The explanation of bonding in \"hypervalent\" p-block molecules has evolved, moving away from models that invoke d-orbital participation toward more physically sound descriptions.
