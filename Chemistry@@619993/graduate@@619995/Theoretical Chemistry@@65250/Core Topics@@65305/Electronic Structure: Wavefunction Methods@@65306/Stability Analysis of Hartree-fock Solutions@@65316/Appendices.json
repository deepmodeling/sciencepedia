For a single particle–hole mode, the orbital-rotation Hessian reduces to a scalar block structure, and the corresponding RPA dynamic matrix becomes a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with real scalar entries $A$ and $B$, where $A$ represents the diagonal (direct) block and $B$ the coupling (exchange) block.

A fundamental principle of linear stability analysis is that a stationary point is stable if small perturbations do not grow exponentially in time. In the context of TDHF/RPA, the time evolution of a perturbation mode with frequency $\\omega$ is proportional to $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$.

This signifies an instability.\n\nThe eigenvalues we derived are $\\omega = \\pm \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}$.\nFor the eigenvalues to be real, the quantity under the square root must be non-negative:\n$$\nA^2 - B^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as $A^2 \\ge B^2$. Taking the square root of both sides and using the given condition that $A \\ge 0$, we find the condition for stability:\n$$\nA \\ge |B|\n$$\nConversely, the HF solution is unstable if the eigenvalues are not real. In our case, this occurs when the quantity under the square root is negative:\n$$\nA^2 - B^2  0\n$$\nWhen this condition holds, the eigenvalues become purely imaginary:\n$$\n\\omega = \\pm i \\sqrt{B^2 - A^2}\n$$\nAn imaginary eigenvalue corresponds to an exponentially growing or decaying mode, which signifies a dynamic instability of the HF stationary point. Therefore, the regime in which the HF solution is unstable is defined by the inequality:\n$$\nA^2  B^2\n$$\nAgain using the fact that $A \\ge 0$, this condition is equivalent to:\n$$\nA  |B|\n$$\nThis is the condition for instability, as requested.

The energy for this single-determinant wavefunction is:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{UHF}} = h_{AA} + h_{BB} + J_{AB}\n$$\nwhere $h_{AA}$ and $h_{BB}$ are the core integrals for the respective atomic orbitals, and $J_{AB}$ is the Coulomb repulsion between an electron in $\\chi_A$ and an electron in $\\chi_B$.

This has the following consequences for our model parameters:\n- The hopping integral $t(R) = h_{AB}(R)$ goes to zero, as it depends on the overlap between $\\chi_A$ and $\\chi_B$: $\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} t(R) = 0$.\n- The on-site core integral $\\alpha(R) = h_{AA}(R)$ approaches the energy of an electron in an isolated hydrogen atom, which we can denote $E_H$.\n- The on-site repulsion $U(R)$ approaches a constant value $U_0$, the energy required to place two electrons on the same hydrogen atom (to form H$^-$).\n\nThe correct dissociation energy of H$_2$ is the sum of the energies of two separate hydrogen atoms: $2 E_H$.\n\nLet us examine the dissociation limit for the two energies we derived:\n- **RHF Limit**:\n$$\n\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} E_{\\mathrm{RHF}}(R) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\left[ 2(\\alpha(R) + t(R)) + \\frac{1}{2}U(R) \\right] = 2(E_H + 0) + \\frac{1}{2}U_0 = 2E_H + \\frac{1}{2}U_0\n$$\nThe RHF energy incorrectly dissociates to a state with energy $U_0/2$ above the correct limit. This is a well-known failure. The RHF wavefunction contains equal parts covalent (H-H) and ionic (H$^+$...H$^-$) configurations. At infinite separation, the ionic configurations are physically incorrect but persist in the RHF description, artificially raising the energy by half the ionic penalty $U_0$.\n\n- **UHF Limit**:\n$$\n\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} E_{\\mathrm{UHF}}(R) = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} [2\\alpha(R)] = 2E_H\n$$\nThe broken-symmetry UHF solution correctly describes the dissociation into two neutral hydrogen atoms, one with spin-up and one with spin-down, yielding the correct dissociation energy.\n\n**4) RHF Instability Condition**\n\nThe RHF solution becomes unstable when a lower-energy solution can be found by breaking the spin symmetry. We can test for this by introducing a small spin-unrestricted perturbation to the RHF wavefunction and checking if the energy decreases.

The energy as a function of $\\theta$ is $E(\\theta) = h_{\\alpha\\alpha} + h_{\\beta\\beta} + J_{\\alpha\\beta}$. The core-hamiltonian terms are $h_{\\alpha\\alpha} = h_{\\beta\\beta} = \\cos^2\\theta h_{gg} + \\sin^2\\theta h_{uu}$. The Coulomb term is $J_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{U}{2}\\cos^2(2\\theta)$.\nThe total energy is:\n$$\nE(\\theta) = 2(\\cos^2\\theta h_{gg} + \\sin^2\\theta h_{uu}) + \\frac{U}{2}\\cos^2(2\\theta)\n$$\nUsing $h_{gg}=\\alpha+t$, $h_{uu}=\\alpha-t$, $\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, $\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$:\n$$\nE(\\theta) = 2(\\alpha+t\\cos(2\\theta)) + \\frac{U}{2}\\cos^2(2\\theta)\n$$\nThe RHF solution at $\\theta=0$ is an extremum. To check for stability, we examine the second derivative $E''(\\theta)$ at $\\theta=0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{d\\theta} = 2t(-2\\sin(2\\theta)) + \\frac{U}{2}(2\\cos(2\\theta)(-\\sin(2\\theta))(2)) = -4t\\sin(2\\theta) - 2U\\sin(2\\theta)\\cos(2\\theta) = -4t\\sin(2\\theta) - U\\sin(4\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{d\\theta^2} = -8t\\cos(2\\theta) - 4U\\cos(4\\theta)\n$$\nEvaluating at $\\theta=0$:\n$$\nE''(0) = -8t - 4U\n$$\nThe RHF solution is stable if $E''(0) > 0$.
