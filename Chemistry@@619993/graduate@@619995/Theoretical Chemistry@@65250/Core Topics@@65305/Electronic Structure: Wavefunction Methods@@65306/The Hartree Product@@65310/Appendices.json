The wavefunction is approximated by the Hartree product $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_{1},\\mathbf{r}_{2})=\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{2})$, where $\\phi$ is a normalized single-particle orbital, i.e., $\\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle=1$.\n\nThe expectation value of the energy is the functional $E[\\phi]$:\n$$\nE[\\phi] = \\langle\\Psi|\\hat{H}|\\Psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{2}) | \\hat{h}_{1} + \\hat{h}_{2} + \\frac{1}{r_{12}} | \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\rangle.\n$$\nExpanding this, we get:\n$$\nE[\\phi] = \\langle\\phi|\\hat{h}_{1}|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle + \\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\hat{h}_{2}|\\phi\\rangle + \\left\\langle\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\left|\\frac{1}{r_{12}}\\right|\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\right\\rangle.\n$$\nSince the electrons are indistinguishable and the orbital $\\phi$ is normalized, this simplifies to:\n$$\nE[\\phi] = 2\\langle\\phi|\\hat{h}|\\phi\\rangle + \\iint \\frac{|\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{1})|^{2}|\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{2})|^{2}}{r_{12}} d\\mathbf{r}_{1}d\\mathbf{r}_{2}.\n$$\nThe first task is to derive the Hartree equation by minimizing $E[\\phi]$ with respect to $\\phi$ under the constraint that $\\phi$ remains normalized. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, minimizing the functional $L[\\phi] = E[\\phi] - 2\\epsilon(\\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle - 1)$. The factor of $2$ is conventional for a two-electron system.

A direct calculation of this integral, for instance by using the multipole expansion of $1/r_{12}$ for spherically symmetric densities, yields the well-known result:\n$$\nJ_{11} = \\frac{5}{8}\\zeta.\n$$\nCombining these terms, the total energy functional becomes a function of $\\zeta$:\n$$\nE(\\zeta) = 2 I_{1} + J_{11} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\zeta^{2}}{2} - Z\\zeta\\right) + \\frac{5}{8}\\zeta = \\zeta^{2} - 2Z\\zeta + \\frac{5}{8}\\zeta.\n$$\nThe problem specifies $Z=2$ for helium.

The directive to use the \"exact one-electron limit implied by the antisymmetry requirement\" is key. For a one-electron system, any exact many-body theory must yield an energy free of electron-electron interactions, as there are no other electrons.

The Hartree-Fock theory, which is the simplest theory that correctly incorporates the antisymmetry of the fermionic wavefunction, is exact for a one-electron system. In Hartree-Fock theory, the spurious self-interaction contained in the Hartree term is precisely canceled by the self-exchange term. The total electron-electron interaction energy for a single electron in an orbital $\\phi$ is $E_{\\mathrm{int}} = J[\\phi] - K[\\phi]$, where $J$ is the Coulomb term and $K$ is the exchange term. For self-interaction, these are:\n$$\nJ[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{|\\phi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 |\\phi(\\mathbf{r}')|^2}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} d^3\\mathbf{r} d^3\\mathbf{r}' = E_H[\\rho]\n$$\n$$\nK[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{\\phi^*(\\mathbf{r})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}')\\phi^*(\\mathbf{r}')\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} d^3\\mathbf{r} d^3\\mathbf{r}'\n$$\nSince the orbital $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is real, the numerator in the exchange integral becomes $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\phi(\\mathbf{r}')\\phi(\\mathbf{r}')\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi^2(\\mathbf{r})\\phi^2(\\mathbf{r}') = |\\phi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 |\\phi(\\mathbf{r}')|^2$. Therefore, $K[\\phi] = J[\\phi]$.\nThe total self-interaction in Hartree-Fock theory is $J[\\phi] - K[\\phi] = 0$.\nThe problem, posed in terms of the density functional $\\rho$, requires a correction functional $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}[\\rho]$ such that the total interaction energy is nullified:\n$$\nE_{H}[\\rho] + E_{\\mathrm{corr}}[\\rho] = 0\n$$\nThis self-interaction free condition dictates that the minimal correction term must be the negative of the Hartree energy. This correction is, in fact, the exact exchange energy functional for a one-electron system.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corr}}[\\rho] = -E_{H}[\\rho]\n$$\nUsing our previously calculated result for $E_{H}[\\rho]$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{corr}}[\\rho] = -\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis is the final answer sought.

For this value, $\\sqrt{k}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $k^{1/4} = (\\frac{1}{4})^{1/4} = (\\frac{1}{2^{2}})^{1/4} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{H}}(k=\\tfrac{1}{4}) = 3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nThe exact ground-state energy is given as $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}=2$. The energy error $\\Delta E$ is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{H}} - E_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right) - 2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nFinally, we address the one-electron density and the Kato cusp condition. The one-electron density for this two-electron Hartree ansatz is $n_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathbf{r}) = 2|\\varphi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}$.\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{H}}(r) = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp(-\\alpha r^{2})\n$$\nThe electron-nucleus Kato cusp condition states $\\frac{1}{n(r)}\\frac{dn(r)}{dr}|_{r=0} = -2Z$. This condition is a direct consequence of the singularity in the Coulomb potential $-Z/r$ of a point-like nucleus. The Hamiltonian for the Hooke's atom contains a harmonic potential $\\frac{1}{2}kr^{2}$, which is analytic (smooth and infinitely differentiable) at the origin $r=0$. There is no singularity. Therefore, the physical premise for the Kato cusp condition does not exist in this system. For our Gaussian density, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{H}}(r)}{dr} = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp(-\\alpha r^{2})(-2\\alpha r) = -4\\alpha r \\, \\varphi_{\\alpha}^2(r)\n$$\nAt the origin, $\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{H}}(r)}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$. The density has a zero slope at the origin, reflecting the smooth nature of the underlying potential. This is the physically correct behavior. The Gaussian ansatz does not possess a cusp, and it correctly models the non-cuspidal nature of the exact wavefunction for this potential. Thus, the density does not \"violate\" the Kato cusp condition; rather, the condition is inapplicable to this system's potential. The failure of the Hartree ansatz lies in its inability to describe the electron-electron cusp, which is a failing of all single-determinant methods.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}} - \\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2814078"}]}
