The Hartree-Fock (HF) reference determinant is given as a closed-shell state, $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = \\lvert 1\\alpha,\\;1\\beta,\\;2\\alpha,\\;2\\beta \\rangle$. This notation implies that the spatial orbitals $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ are doubly occupied in the HF reference state. These are the occupied orbitals. The remaining spatial orbitals, $\\phi_{3}$ and $\\phi_{4}$, are unoccupied and are termed virtual orbitals.\n\nThe analysis is performed in the basis of Slater determinants with a conserved total spin projection $M_{S}=0$.

All necessary data are provided, and the concepts of Configuration Interaction Singles and Doubles (CISD), Hartree-Fock (HF) energy, and size-extensivity corrections are standard topics in theoretical quantum chemistry. We will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe fundamental deficiency of the truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) method, such as CISD, is its lack of size-extensivity. For a system composed of $N$ non-interacting identical subsystems, a size-extensive method must yield a total energy equal to $N$ times the energy of a single subsystem. CISD fails this requirement because it omits higher-order excitations that are crucial for describing the separation of electron pairs. Specifically, the CISD wavefunction,\n$$ |\\Psi_{\\text{CISD}}\\rangle = c_0 |\\Phi_0\\rangle + \\sum_{i,a} c_i^a |\\Phi_i^a\\rangle + \\sum_{i<j, a<b} c_{ij}^{ab} |\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\\rangle $$\nis normalized such that $c_0^2 + \\sum_{i,a} (c_i^a)^2 + \\sum_{i<j, a<b} (c_{ij}^{ab})^2 = 1$.

However, it omits, for instance, quadruple excitations. For two non-interacting molecules A and B, a double excitation on A and a double excitation on B constitute a quadruple excitation for the combined system A+B. CISD cannot describe this state, leading to the size-extensivity error.\n\nThe corrections developed by Davidson and others are designed to estimate the energy contribution of these missing excitations, primarily the unlinked quadruple excitations, which can be thought of as products of double excitations. The correlation energy recovered by the CISD calculation is defined as:\n$$ E_{\\text{corr, CISD}} = E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}} $$\nThe weight of all excited determinants in the normalized CISD wavefunction is $1 - c_0^2$. This term is dominated by the contribution from double excitations.\n\nFirst, we construct the Davidson correction. This correction is based on fourth-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory arguments. It approximates the energy contribution of the missing quadruple excitations, $\\Delta E_Q$, by assuming it is proportional to the correlation energy already recovered, scaled by the total weight of the excited determinants.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Davidson}} = (1 - c_0^2)(E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}) $$\nThis is the most common form of the correction. The total energy including this correction, which we denote $E_{\\text{Davidson}}$, is then:\n$$ E_{\\text{Davidson}} = E_{\\text{CISD}} + \\Delta E_{\\text{Davidson}} = E_{\\text{CISD}} + (1 - c_0^2)(E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}) $$\n\nNext, we construct the Pople correction. This correction, often referred to as the renormalized Davidson correction, is based on a more aggressive scaling assumption. The underlying heuristic is that the total correlation energy, $E_{\\text{corr, Total}}$, can be estimated by scaling the CISD correlation energy by the inverse of the weight of the reference determinant, $c_0^2$.\n$$ E_{\\text{corr, Total}} \\approx \\frac{E_{\\text{corr, CISD}}}{c_0^2} = \\frac{E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}}{c_0^2} $$\nThe correction term, $\\Delta E_{\\text{Pople}}$, is the difference between this estimated total correlation energy and the correlation energy already included in CISD.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Pople}} = E_{\\text{corr, Total}} - E_{\\text{corr, CISD}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}}{c_0^2} - (E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Pople}} = (E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}) \\left(\\frac{1}{c_0^2} - 1\\right) = (E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}) \\frac{1 - c_0^2}{c_0^2} $$\nThe total energy including the Pople correction, $E_{\\text{Pople}}$, is:\n$$ E_{\\text{Pople}} = E_{\\text{CISD}} + \\Delta E_{\\text{Pople}} = E_{\\text{CISD}} + \\frac{1 - c_0^2}{c_0^2}(E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}}) $$\n\nWe now evaluate these expressions using the provided data:\n- $E_{\\text{HF}} = -75.000000$ Hartree\n- $E_{\\text{CISD}} = -75.120000$ Hartree\n- $c_0^2 = 0.88$\n\nFirst, compute the CISD correlation energy:\n$$ E_{\\text{CISD}} - E_{\\text{HF}} = -75.120000 - (-75.000000) = -0.120000 \\text{ Hartree} $$\nAnd the weight of the excited determinants:\n$$ 1 - c_0^2 = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 $$\n\nNow, calculate the Davidson-corrected energy, $E_{\\text{Davidson}}$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Davidson}} = (0.12)(-0.120000) = -0.014400 \\text{ Hartree} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{Davidson}} = -75.120000 + (-0.014400) = -75.134400 \\text{ Hartree} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures, this is $-75.1344$.\n\nNext, calculate the Pople-corrected energy, $E_{\\text{Pople}}$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{Pople}} = \\frac{0.12}{0.88}(-0.120000) \\approx (0.13636363...)(-0.120000) = -0.01636363... \\text{ Hartree} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{Pople}} = -75.120000 + (-0.01636363...) = -75.13636363... \\text{ Hartree} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures, this is $-75.1364$.\n\nFinally, compute the difference $E_{\\text{Pople}} - E_{\\text{Davidson}}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{Pople}} - E_{\\text{Davidson}} = (-75.13636363...) - (-75.134400) = -0.00196363... \\text{ Hartree} $$\nAlternatively, using the analytical expressions for the corrections:\n$$ E_{\\text{Pople}} - E_{\\text{Davidson}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{Pople}} - \\Delta E_{\\text{Davidson}} = -0.01636363... - (-0.014400) = -0.00196363... \\text{ Hartree} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures gives $-0.00196364$.\n\nThe three requested numerical quantities, rounded to $6$ significant figures, are:\n1. Davidson-corrected energy: $-75.1344$ Hartree\n2. Pople-corrected energy: $-75.1364$ Hartree\n3.
