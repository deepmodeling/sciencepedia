Due to the homonuclear symmetry of $\\text{H}_2^+$, we have $H_{11} = H_{22}$ and $H_{12} = H_{21}$. The overlap integral $S_{12}$ is also equal to $S_{21}$.

The Coulomb integral $H_{11}(R)$ and the resonance integral $H_{12}(R)$ are both negative quantities for stable bonding configurations. The overlap integral $S_{12}(R)$ is positive and less than $1$. The bonding orbital corresponds to the lower energy. Since $H_{12}(R)$ is negative, adding it to $H_{11}(R)$ in the numerator of $\\varepsilon_2$ makes the energy more negative (lower). Conversely, subtracting the negative $H_{12}(R)$ in the numerator of $\\varepsilon_1$ makes the energy less negative (higher).\nTherefore, the bonding orbital energy, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{bonding}}$, is $\\varepsilon_2$, and the antibonding orbital energy, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{antibonding}}$, is $\\varepsilon_1$.\n\nBonding orbital energy ($\\sigma_g$):\n$$\n\\varepsilon_g(R) = \\frac{H_{11}(R) + H_{12}(R)}{1 + S_{12}(R)}\n$$\nAntibonding orbital energy ($\\sigma_u^*$):\n$$\n\\varepsilon_u(R) = \\frac{H_{11}(R) - H_{12}(R)}{1 - S_{12}(R)}\n$$\nThese are the analytical expressions for the two orbital energies as required.

Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combinations (SALCs) and Symmetry of Atomic Orbitals**\n\nFirst, we determine the irreducible representations spanned by the basis of the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals, which we denote as $\\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2, \\psi_3\\}$. We apply the symmetry operations of the $C_{3v}$ group and find the trace (character) of the resulting transformation matrix. The operations in $C_{3v}$ are the identity ($E$), two rotations by $\\pm 2\\pi/3$ ($2C_3$), and three vertical reflection planes ($3\\sigma_v$).\n-   $\\hat{E}$ leaves all three orbitals unchanged: $\\chi(E) = 3$.\n-   $\\hat{C_3}$ permutes all three orbitals, so none are left in their original position: $\\chi(C_3) = 0$.\n-   A $\\hat{\\sigma_v}$ plane passes through the nitrogen atom and one hydrogen atom (e.g., $\\mathrm{H_1}$), leaving its orbital $\\psi_1$ unchanged, while swapping the other two ($\\psi_2 \\leftrightarrow \\psi_3$): $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\nThe resulting reducible representation is $\\Gamma_{1s} = (3, 0, 1)$.\n\nTo decompose $\\Gamma_{1s}$ into its irreducible representation components ($A_1$, $A_2$, $E$), we use the reduction formula $n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_R \\chi_i(R)^* \\chi(R)$, where $h=6$ is the order of the group and $\\chi_i(R)$ are characters from the $C_{3v}$ character table.\n-   $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} [1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1] = \\frac{1}{6}(3+3) = 1$.\n-   $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} [1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1] = \\frac{1}{6}(3-3) = 0$.\n-   $n_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} [1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1] = \\frac{1}{6}(6) = 1$.\nThus, the combination of the three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals gives rise to SALCs of $A_1$ and $E$ symmetry: $\\Gamma_{1s} = A_1 \\oplus E$.\n\nWe construct the SALCs using the projection operator formalism, $\\hat{P}^{(i)} = \\frac{l_i}{h} \\sum_R \\chi_i(R)^* \\hat{R}$.\nFor the $A_1$ SALC, we project onto $\\psi_1$:\n$\\hat{P}^{(A_1)}\\psi_1 \\propto (\\hat{E} + \\hat{C_3} + \\hat{C_3^2} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v1} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v2} + \\hat{\\sigma}_{v3})\\psi_1 = \\psi_1 + \\psi_2 + \\psi_3 + \\psi_1 + \\psi_3 + \\psi_2 \\propto \\psi_1 + \\psi_2 + \\psi_3$.\nAssuming the atomic orbitals form an orthonormal set ($\\langle \\psi_i | \\psi_j \\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$), the normalization constant is $N = (\\langle (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) | (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) \\rangle)^{-1/2} = (1+1+1)^{-1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe normalized $A_1$ SALC is $\\phi_H^{(A_1)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\psi_1 + \\psi_2 + \\psi_3)$.\n\nFor the $E$ SALCs, we project $\\psi_1$ using $\\hat{P}^{(E)}$:\n$\\hat{P}^{(E)}\\psi_1 \\propto (2\\hat{E} - \\hat{C_3} - \\hat{C_3^2})\\psi_1 = 2\\psi_1 - \\psi_2 - \\psi_3$.\nNormalizing this gives the first $E$ SALC: $\\phi_{Ea} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(2\\psi_1 - \\psi_2 - \\psi_3)$.\nA second SALC, orthogonal to both $\\phi_H^{(A_1)}$ and $\\phi_{Ea}$, can be constructed. By inspection, the combination $\\psi_2 - \\psi_3$ is orthogonal to $\\phi_H^{(A_1)}$ and $\\phi_{Ea}$.\nNormalizing gives the second $E$ SALC: $\\phi_{Eb} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_2 - \\psi_3)$.\nThe pair $\\{\\phi_{Ea}, \\phi_{Eb}\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the $E$ representation.\n\nThe nitrogen atomic orbitals are centered on the principal axis. Their symmetries are determined by their transformation properties:\n-   The $2s$ orbital is spherically symmetric and remains unchanged under all operations: symmetry $A_1$.\n-   The $2p_z$ orbital is aligned with the $C_3$ axis ($z$-axis) and is also unchanged by any group operation: symmetry $A_1$.\n-   The $(2p_x, 2p_y)$ orbitals lie in the $xy$-plane and transform as the $(x, y)$ coordinates in the character table: symmetry $E$.\n\n**2. Block Diagonalization of Fock and Overlap Matrices**\n\nThe Roothaan-Hall equations are written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{C}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is the Fock matrix and $\\mathbf{S}$ is the overlap matrix. The molecular Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}$, and by extension the effective one-electron Fock operator, $\\hat{F}$, must be totally symmetric under all operations of the molecular point group.\nThe Great Orthogonality Theorem of group theory states that the matrix element of a totally symmetric operator between two functions that belong to different irreducible representations is zero. That is, $\\langle \\phi^{(i)} | \\hat{A} | \\phi^{(j)} \\rangle = 0$ if $i \\neq j$, for $\\hat{A}$ being totally symmetric.\nSince both $\\hat{F}$ and the identity operator (for the overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$) are totally symmetric, their matrix representations will have zero elements between basis functions of different symmetries. By choosing our basis set to be the SALCs, which are basis functions for the irreducible representations $A_1$ and $E$, the $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$ matrices become block-diagonal.\nThe basis for the $A_1$ block is composed of all basis functions of $A_1$ symmetry: $\\{\\chi_{2s}, \\chi_{2p_z}, \\phi_H^{(A_1)}\\}$.\nThe basis for the $E$ block is composed of all basis functions of $E$ symmetry: $\\{\\chi_{2p_x}, \\chi_{2p_y}, \\phi_{Ea}, \\phi_{Eb}\\}$.\nThe full matrices thus separate into an $A_1$ block and an $E$ block:\n$$ \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{F}_{A_1} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{F}_{E} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{S}_{A_1} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{S}_{E} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis simplifies the problem, as each block can be diagonalized independently.\n\n**3. & 4. Construction and Solution of the $A_1$ Block Fock Matrix**\n\nThe problem states to assume the basis has been orthonormalized such that $\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{I}$. This reduces the generalized eigenvalue problem to a standard one, $\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{C}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. We construct the $3 \\times 3$ Fock matrix $\\mathbf{F}_{A_1}$ for the $A_1$ block using the basis $\\{\\chi_{2s}, \\chi_{2p_z}, \\phi_H^{(A_1)}\\}$. The matrix elements $F_{ij} = \\langle \\chi_i | \\hat{F} | \\chi_j \\rangle$ are determined from the given parameters:\n-   $F_{11} = \\langle \\chi_{2s} | \\hat{F} | \\chi_{2s} \\rangle = \\alpha_s = -26.00$ eV.\n-   $F_{22} = \\langle \\chi_{2p_z} | \\hat{F} | \\chi_{2p_z} \\rangle = \\alpha_p = -13.40$ eV.\n-   $F_{33} = \\langle \\phi_H^{(A_1)} | \\hat{F} | \\phi_H^{(A_1)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3}\\langle (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) | \\hat{F} | (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) \\rangle$. Neglecting direct H-H interactions ($\\langle \\psi_i | \\hat{F} | \\psi_j \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$), this simplifies to $F_{33} = \\frac{1}{3}(3\\alpha_H) = \\alpha_H = -13.60$ eV.\n-   $F_{12} = \\langle \\chi_{2s} | \\hat{F} | \\chi_{2p_z} \\rangle = 0$, as given.\n-   $F_{13} = \\langle \\chi_{2s} | \\hat{F} | \\phi_H^{(A_1)} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\langle \\chi_{2s} | \\hat{F} | (\\psi_1+\\psi_2+\\psi_3) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(3\\beta_s) = \\sqrt{3}\\beta_s = -5.00\\sqrt{3}$ eV.\n-   $F_{23} = \\langle \\chi_{2p_z} | \\hat{F} | \\phi_H^{(A_1)} \\rangle = \\sqrt{3}\\beta_p = -2.00\\sqrt{3}$ eV, as per the defined parameters.\n\nThe resulting $\\mathbf{F}_{A_1}$ matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}_{A_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -26.00 & 0 & -5.00\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 0 & -13.40 & -2.00\\sqrt{3} \\\\ -5.00\\sqrt{3} & -2.00\\sqrt{3} & -13.60 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the orbital energies (eigenvalues $E$), we solve the secular equation $\\det(\\mathbf{F}_{A_1} - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} -26.00 - E & 0 & -5.00\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 0 & -13.40 - E & -2.00\\sqrt{3} \\\\ -5.00\\sqrt{3} & -2.00\\sqrt{3} & -13.60 - E \\end{vmatrix} = 0 $$\nExpanding the determinant:\n$(-26.00 - E) [(-13.40 - E)(-13.60 - E) - (-2.00\\sqrt{3})^2] - (-5.00\\sqrt{3})[0 - (-13.40 - E)(-5.00\\sqrt{3})] = 0$\n$-(E+26.00)[(E+13.40)(E+13.60) - 12.00] + 75.00(E+13.40) = 0$\nThis is a cubic equation for $E$.

Let the spatial molecular orbital occupations be $g_{b}$ and $g_{a}$ (with $0\\leq g_{i}\\leq 2$), so that the one-particle density matrix in the atomic orbital basis is\n$$\nP_{\\mu\\nu}=\\sum_{i\\in\\{b,a\\}} g_{i}\\,C_{\\mu i}\\,C_{\\nu i}.\n$$\nThe Wiberg bond index between atoms $A$ and $B$ is defined by\n$$\nW_{AB}=\\sum_{\\mu\\in A}\\sum_{\\nu\\in B}(P S)_{\\mu\\nu}\\,(P S)_{\\nu\\mu},\n$$\nwhere $(P S)_{\\mu\\nu}$ are the elements of the product matrix $P S$. Using only the definitions provided, derive $W_{AB}$ in closed form as a function of $g_{b}$ and $g_{a}$, simplifying your result as far as possible. Express your final answer as a single analytical expression. No numerical rounding is required. The Wiberg bond index is dimensionless, so do not include units in your final expression.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard derivation within the framework of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) molecular orbital theory. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided, and no inconsistencies are present. The problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to derive the Wiberg bond index $W_{AB}$ as a function of the molecular orbital occupation numbers $g_{b}$ and $g_{a}$. The definition provided is\n$$\nW_{AB}=\\sum_{\\mu\\in A}\\sum_{\\nu\\in B}(P S)_{\\mu\\nu}\\,(P S)_{\\nu\\mu}\n$$\nIn this minimal basis set, atom $A$ contributes one atomic orbital $\\chi_{A}$ (labeled $\\mu=A$) and atom $B$ contributes one atomic orbital $\\chi_{B}$ (labeled $\\nu=B$). The summations therefore each contain only a single term:\n$$\nW_{AB} = (PS)_{AB} (PS)_{BA}\n$$\nwhere $(PS)_{AB}$ and $(PS)_{BA}$ are elements of the matrix product $P S$. Our first objective is to compute this matrix product.\n\nThe coefficient matrix $C$ represents the transformation from the atomic orbital (AO) basis $\\{\\chi_{A}, \\chi_{B}\\}$ to the molecular orbital (MO) basis $\\{\\psi_{b}, \\psi_{a}\\}$. The columns of $C$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to the MOs. From the given definitions of the MOs,\n$$\n\\psi_{b}=N_{b}(\\chi_{A}+\\chi_{B}) = N_{b}\\chi_{A} + N_{b}\\chi_{B}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi_{a}=N_{a}(\\chi_{A}-\\chi_{B}) = N_{a}\\chi_{A} - N_{a}\\chi_{B}\n$$\nthe coefficient matrix is\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{Ab} & C_{Aa} \\\\ C_{Bb} & C_{Ba} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} N_{b} & N_{a} \\\\ N_{b} & -N_{a} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe normalization factors $N_{b}$ and $N_{a}$ are obtained from the condition that the MOs are normalized, $\\langle \\psi_{i} | \\psi_{i} \\rangle = 1$.\nFor the bonding orbital $\\psi_{b}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\psi_{b} | \\psi_{b} \\rangle = \\langle N_{b}(\\chi_{A}+\\chi_{B}) | N_{b}(\\chi_{A}+\\chi_{B}) \\rangle = N_{b}^{2} (\\langle \\chi_{A}|\\chi_{A} \\rangle + \\langle \\chi_{B}|\\chi_{B} \\rangle + 2\\langle \\chi_{A}|\\chi_{B} \\rangle) = 1\n$$\nUsing the given normalizations $\\langle \\chi_{\\mu}|\\chi_{\\mu} \\rangle = 1$ and the overlap integral $s = \\langle \\chi_{A}|\\chi_{B} \\rangle$, we have:\n$$\nN_{b}^{2} (1 + 1 + 2s) = 1 \\implies N_{b}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2(1+s)}\n$$\nFor the antibonding orbital $\\psi_{a}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\psi_{a} | \\psi_{a} \\rangle = \\langle N_{a}(\\chi_{A}-\\chi_{B}) | N_{a}(\\chi_{A}-\\chi_{B}) \\rangle = N_{a}^{2} (\\langle \\chi_{A}|\\chi_{A} \\rangle + \\langle \\chi_{B}|\\chi_{B} \\rangle - 2\\langle \\chi_{A}|\\chi_{B} \\rangle) = 1\n$$\n$$\nN_{a}^{2} (1 + 1 - 2s) = 1 \\implies N_{a}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2(1-s)}\n$$\nNext, we construct the one-particle density matrix $P$, whose elements are defined as $P_{\\mu\\nu}=\\sum_{i\\in\\{b,a\\}} g_{i}\\,C_{\\mu i}\\,C_{\\nu i}$.\n$$\nP_{AA} = g_{b} C_{Ab}^{2} + g_{a} C_{Aa}^{2} = g_{b} N_{b}^{2} + g_{a} N_{a}^{2} = \\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)} + \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}\n$$\n$$\nP_{BB} = g_{b} C_{Bb}^{2} + g_{a} C_{Ba}^{2} = g_{b} N_{b}^{2} + g_{a} (-N_{a})^{2} = P_{AA}\n$$\n$$\nP_{AB} = g_{b} C_{Ab} C_{Bb} + g_{a} C_{Aa} C_{Ba} = g_{b} N_{b}^{2} - g_{a} N_{a}^{2} = \\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)} - \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}\n$$\nSince the basis functions are real, $P$ is symmetric, so $P_{BA} = P_{AB}$.\n\nNow we compute the matrix product $PS$:\n$$\nPS = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{AA} & P_{AB} \\\\ P_{AB} & P_{AA} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s \\\\ s & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{AA} + s P_{AB} & s P_{AA} + P_{AB} \\\\ P_{AB} + s P_{AA} & s P_{AB} + P_{AA} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need the off-diagonal elements $(PS)_{AB}$ and $(PS)_{BA}$.\n$$\n(PS)_{AB} = s P_{AA} + P_{AB} = s\\left(\\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)} + \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)} - \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n(PS)_{AB} = \\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)}(s+1) + \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}(s-1) = \\frac{g_{b}}{2} - \\frac{g_{a}}{2} = \\frac{g_{b}-g_{a}}{2}\n$$\nSimilarly, for $(PS)_{BA}$:\n$$\n(PS)_{BA} = P_{AB} + s P_{AA} = \\left(\\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)} - \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}\\right) + s\\left(\\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)} + \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n(PS)_{BA} = \\frac{g_{b}}{2(1+s)}(1+s) + \\frac{g_{a}}{2(1-s)}(-1+s) = \\frac{g_{b}}{2} - \\frac{g_{a}}{2} = \\frac{g_{b}-g_{a}}{2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute these results into the expression for the Wiberg bond index:\n$$\nW_{AB} = (PS)_{AB} (PS)_{BA} = \\left(\\frac{g_{b}-g_{a}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{g_{b}-g_{a}}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{g_{b}-g_{a}}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThis expression can be expanded to obtain the final form.\n$$\nW_{AB} = \\frac{1}{4}(g_{b}-g_{a})^{2}\n$$\nThe result remarkably shows that for this symmetric system, the Wiberg bond index depends only on the occupations of the bonding and antibonding orbitals and is independent of the specific value of the overlap integral $s$. This is a consequence of the definition involving the matrix product $PS$, which corresponds to a representation in a symmetrically orthogonalized basis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}(g_{b}-g_{a})^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2816303"}]}
