By convention, the lower energy (bonding) orbital is associated with the symmetric combination of atomic orbitals, and the higher energy (antibonding) orbital with the antisymmetric combination.

From the first secular equation, $c_{A}(\\alpha - E) + c_{B}(\\beta - ES) = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{c_{A}}{c_{B}} = -\\frac{\\beta - ES}{\\alpha - E} = \\frac{ES - \\beta}{\\alpha - E} $$\nFor the bonding energy $E = E_{+}$, we find the corresponding ratio $(c_{A}/c_{B})_{+}$.\n$$ (c_{A}/c_{B})_{+} = \\frac{E_{+}S - \\beta}{\\alpha - E_{+}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1 + S}\\right)S - \\beta}{\\alpha - \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1 + S}} = \\frac{\\frac{(\\alpha + \\beta)S - \\beta(1+S)}{1+S}}{\\frac{\\alpha(1+S) - (\\alpha+\\beta)}{1+S}} = \\frac{\\alpha S + \\beta S - \\beta - \\beta S}{\\alpha + \\alpha S - \\alpha - \\beta} = \\frac{\\alpha S - \\beta}{\\alpha S - \\beta} = 1 $$\nThis corresponds to the symmetric combination $\\psi_{+} \\propto (\\phi_A + \\phi_B)$.\n\nFor the antibonding energy $E = E_{-}$, we find the corresponding ratio $(c_{A}/c_{B})_{-}$.\n$$ (c_{A}/c_{B})_{-} = \\frac{E_{-}S - \\beta}{\\alpha - E_{-}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1 - S}\\right)S - \\beta}{\\alpha - \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1 - S}} = \\frac{\\frac{(\\alpha - \\beta)S - \\beta(1-S)}{1-S}}{\\frac{\\alpha(1-S) - (\\alpha-\\beta)}{1-S}} = \\frac{\\alpha S - \\beta S - \\beta + \\beta S}{\\alpha - \\alpha S - \\alpha + \\beta} = \\frac{\\alpha S - \\beta}{-\\alpha S + \\beta} = -1 $$\nThis corresponds to the antisymmetric combination $\\psi_{-} \\propto (\\phi_A - \\phi_B)$.\n\nIn summary, the two energy solutions and their corresponding coefficient ratios are:\n$E_{+} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1 + S}$ with $(c_{A}/c_{B})_{+} = 1$.\n$E_{-} = \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1 - S}$ with $(c_{A}/c_{B})_{-} = -1$.\nThe problem requests the final answer as a single row matrix containing $E_{+}$, $E_{-}$, $(c_{A}/c_{B})_{+}$, and $(c_{A}/c_{B})_{-}$, in that order.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{1 + S} & \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{1 - S} & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2787574"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basic MO framework, we now apply these concepts to predict a key physical property of a more complex system, a heteronuclear diatomic molecule.

The transformation matrix is $S^{-1/2}$, and the density matrix in the new basis is $P' = S^{1/2} P S^{1/2}$. The Löwdin gross electron populations are the diagonal elements of $P'$, $N'_A = P'_{AA}$ and $N'_B = P'_{BB}$. The Löwdin bond index is defined as the Mayer bond index in the orthogonal basis, which for this case is $(P'_{AB})^2$.\nThe off-diagonal element of the transformed density matrix is given by the formula $P'_{AB} = \\frac{s}{2}(P_{AA}+P_{BB}) + P_{AB}$.\nUsing $s=0.20$ and the components of $P$:\n$P'_{AB} = (0.20/2)(1.25+0.45) + 0.75 = 0.10(1.70) + 0.75 = 0.17 + 0.75 = 0.92$.\nThe Löwdin bond index is $I_{AB}^{\\text{Löwdin}} = (P'_{AB})^2 = (0.92)^2 = 0.8464$.\n\nThe Löwdin gross population on atom A is $N'_A = (PS)_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\sqrt{1-s^2})(P_{BB}-P_{AA})$.\nUsing our calculated values:\n$N'_A = 1.40 + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\sqrt{1-0.20^2})(0.45-1.25) = 1.40 + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\sqrt{0.96})(-0.80)$\n$N'_A = 1.40 - 0.40(1-0.9798) = 1.40 - 0.40(0.0202) = 1.40 - 0.00808 \\approx 1.39192$.\nThe corresponding population on B is $N'_B = 2 - N'_A \\approx 0.60808$.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement:\n\n- **A. In Mulliken analysis, the gross electron population on atom $A$ is $1.40$, the gross population on $B$ is $0.60$, and the Mulliken bond index is $0.30$.**\nOur calculations yielded $N_A = 1.40$, $N_B = 0.60$, and $I_{AB}^{\\text{Mulliken}} = 0.30$. This statement is correct.\n\n- **B. Symmetric Löwdin orthogonalization redistributes overlap density to the AO diagonals in such a way that, for this case, the magnitude of the negative charge on the more electronegative atom $A$ is smaller than in Mulliken analysis.**\nThe charge on an atom is $Q_X = Z_X^{\\mathrm{val}} - N_X$.\nMulliken charge on A: $Q_A = 1 - N_A = 1 - 1.40 = -0.40$. The magnitude is $|Q_A| = 0.40$.\nLöwdin charge on A: $Q'_A = 1 - N'_A \\approx 1 - 1.39192 = -0.39192$. The magnitude is $|Q'_A| \\approx 0.39192$.\nThe comparison $|Q'_A|  |Q_A|$ ($0.39192  0.40$) is true. This statement is correct.\n\n- **C. The Löwdin bond index, taken as the Mayer bond index in the symmetrically orthogonalized basis, is $0.8464$ and is larger than the Mulliken overlap-population-based bond index for this example.**\nOur calculated Löwdin bond index is $I_{AB}^{\\text{Löwdin}} = 0.8464$. Our calculated Mulliken bond index is $I_{AB}^{\\text{Mulliken}} = 0.30$. The value $0.8464$ is correct, and the comparison $0.8464 > 0.30$ is also correct. This statement is correct.\n\n- **D. For any $s$ with $\\lvert s \\rvert  1$ and any $r$, if the MO is normalized with respect to $S$, the Mulliken and Löwdin atomic charges are identical; therefore the orthogonalization choice does not affect charges.**\nThis general statement is false. Our specific calculation shows that the charges are not identical: $Q_A=-0.40$ and $Q'_A \\approx -0.392$. The difference is non-zero unless $s=0$ or the density matrix is non-polar ($P_{AA}=P_{BB}$), which is not the general case. This statement is incorrect.\n\n- **E. In this two-function example, the Löwdin transformation always reduces the off-diagonal density element relative to the original $P_{AB}$, and thus the Löwdin bond index defined as the square of the off-diagonal density in the orthogonal basis is always smaller than the Mulliken bond index $2 s P_{AB}$.**\nThe first claim is that $|P'_{AB}|  |P_{AB}|$. In our case, $P'_{AB} = 0.92$ and $P_{AB}=0.75$. Since $0.92 > 0.75$, this claim is false for the given data. The second claim is that the Löwdin bond index is always smaller than the Mulliken bond index. In our case, $I_{AB}^{\\text{Löwdin}} = 0.8464$ and $I_{AB}^{\\text{Mulliken}} = 0.30$. Since $0.8464 > 0.30$, this claim is also false. This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A, B, and C are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2787529"}]}
