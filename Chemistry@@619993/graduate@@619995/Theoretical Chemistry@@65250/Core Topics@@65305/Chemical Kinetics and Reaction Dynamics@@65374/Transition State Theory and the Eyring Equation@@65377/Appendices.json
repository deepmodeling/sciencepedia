The question is a direct test of knowledge of a standard scientific methodology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It represents a standard task in computational chemistry. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe rate constant $k(T)$ according to TST with a tunneling correction $\\kappa(T)$ is given by the Eyring equation:\n$$ k(T) = \\kappa(T) \\frac{k_B T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T) / (RT)} $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)$ is the Gibbs free energy of activation. $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)$ is defined as the difference in Gibbs free energy between the activated complex ($^\\ddagger$) and the reactant ($R$):\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T) = G^{\\ddagger}(T) - G_R(T) $$\nThe total Gibbs free energy $G(T)$ for a molecule is calculated from its partition function $Q(T)$ using statistical mechanics, or more commonly, by summing its constituent energy terms:\n$$ G(T) = E_{\\text{elec}} + E_{\\text{ZPE}} + G_{\\text{thermal}}(T) $$\nHere, $E_{\\text{elec}}$ is the electronic energy from the quantum chemistry calculation, $E_{\\text{ZPE}}$ is the zero-point vibrational energy, and $G_{\\text{thermal}}(T)$ is the thermal correction to the Gibbs free energy, which includes translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions at temperature $T$.\n\nA correct workflow must rigorously perform the following steps:\n1.  **Stationary Point Location and Characterization**: Optimize the geometries of the reactant $R$ and the transition state structure $^\\ddagger$. A subsequent frequency calculation must confirm that $R$ is a true minimum (zero imaginary frequencies) and $^\\ddagger$ is a first-order saddle point (exactly one imaginary frequency, $\\nu_{im}$). This confirms their nature as stationary points.\n2.  **Connectivity Verification**: A saddle point is only mathematically defined. To be the *transition state* for the reaction $R \\to P$, it must dynamically connect these two minima. This is verified by an Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculation, which traces the minimum energy path from the saddle point down to the adjacent minima. This step is non-negotiable for establishing the relevance of the found saddle point to the reaction of interest.\n3.  **Partition Function and Thermodynamic Data Calculation**: To compute $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)$, one needs the properties of $R$ and $^\\ddagger$. This requires computing their partition functions under the RRHO approximation.\n    - For the reactant $R$, all $3N-6$ (or $3N-5$ for linear molecules) real vibrational modes are used.\n    - For the transition state $^\\ddagger$, the motion along the reaction coordinate, corresponding to the imaginary frequency, is treated as the reaction progress and is explicitly factored out in the derivation of the Eyring equation. Therefore, its vibrational partition function must be computed using only the $3N-7$ (or $3N-6$) real vibrational modes.\n    - Rotational partition functions depend on the moments of inertia (from geometry) and the rotational symmetry number ($\\sigma$). These must be included as they affect the entropy.\n    - The reaction path degeneracy ($m$), which accounts for multiple equivalent pathways, must also be considered.\n4.  **Rate Constant Calculation**: The individual free energies $G_R(T)$ and $G^\\ddagger(T)$ are assembled from electronic energy, ZPE (sum over real modes only), and thermal corrections. The activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)$ is then used in the Eyring equation to find $k_{\\mathrm{TST}}(T)$.\n5.  **Tunneling Correction**: Since TST is a classical barrier-crossing theory, quantum mechanical tunneling must be added as a correction. The rate is multiplied by a transmission coefficient $\\kappa(T)$. Simple models like the Wigner correction depend on the curvature of the potential energy barrier at the peak, which is directly related to the imaginary frequency $\\nu_{im}$. More advanced models (e.g., Eckart, small-curvature tunneling) also rely on properties of the barrier shape.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option presents a workflow that follows all the required steps in the correct logical sequence.\n- It correctly specifies optimization and frequency characterization of both $R$ and $^\\ddagger$.\n- It correctly mandates the IRC calculation to verify connectivity, ensuring the dynamical relevance of the transition state.\n- It correctly describes the calculation of partition functions, including the critical detail of removing the imaginary frequency from the $^\\ddagger$ calculation and including symmetry numbers and path degeneracy.\n- It correctly specifies the calculation of Gibbs free energies $G_R(T)$ and $G^\\ddagger(T)$ by including ZPE and thermal contributions, with a note on standard state consistency.\n- It correctly formulates the final step: calculating $k_{\\mathrm{TST}}(T)$ from $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)$ and then applying a physically justified tunneling correction $\\kappa(T)$ that is based on the barrier curvature.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option is fundamentally flawed.\n- It indefensibly skips the IRC verification, failing to establish that the saddle point is relevant to the reaction.\n- It incorrectly includes the imaginary frequency in the partition function of $^\\ddagger$, which is a nonsensical mathematical operation and violates the principles of TST.\n- It incorrectly neglects ZPE, thermal corrections, and symmetry numbers, all of which are essential for an accurate calculation.\n- It oversimplifies the activation energy to the electronic barrier height, ignoring ZPE and thermal/entropic effects.\n- It ignores the requirement for a tunneling correction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option contains numerous errors.\n- It replaces the rigorous IRC with a non-rigorous \"constrained scan\", which does not guarantee finding the true minimum energy path.\n- It omits rotational symmetry numbers and reaction path degeneracy, leading to an incorrect entropy of activation.\n- It proposes using the *smallest real frequency* to estimate tunneling. This is fundamentally wrong; the tunneling probability is related to the barrier shape along the reaction coordinate, which is quantified by the *imaginary frequency*.\n- It incorrectly computes the rate constant from only the ZPE-corrected electronic barrier, neglecting all thermal contributions to enthalpy and all entropy terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option is also incorrect.\n- It skips the essential IRC verification step.\n- It incorrectly omits the ZPE from the energy calculation. The ZPE is a dominant quantum correction to the barrier height and cannot be ignored.\n- It incorrectly equates $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}(T)$ with the electronic barrier height, ignoring both ZPE and thermal enthalpy corrections. This leads to an incorrect Gibbs free energy of activation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** This option contains a critical conceptual error.\n- It incorrectly claims that rotational contributions to the partition function cancel in a unimolecular reaction. While this is true for translation, it is not true for rotation. The moments of inertia and symmetry numbers of the reactant $R$ and transition state $^\\ddagger$ are generally different, leading to a non-zero rotational contribution to $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$.

All necessary data and simplifying assumptions are provided to permit a unique solution. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for a unimolecular reaction, defined as the ratio of the rate constant for the hydrogen isotopologue ($k_{\\mathrm{H}}$) to that of the deuterium isotopologue ($k_{\\mathrm{D}}$). The theoretical framework is canonical Transition State Theory (TST).\n\nAccording to TST, the rate constant $k(T)$ at a temperature $T$ is given by:\n$$ k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}}{Q_R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $Q_R$ is the total canonical partition function of the reactant species, and $Q^{\\ddagger}$ is the total partition function of the transition state (TS) with the motion along the reaction coordinate factored out. $V_0^{\\ddagger}$ is the classical potential energy barrier height, which is the difference in electronic energies between the transition state and the reactant.\n\nThe KIE, $k_{\\mathrm{H}}/k_{\\mathrm{D}}$, is the ratio of the rate constants:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{H}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{D}}^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{D}}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_0^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right)} $$\nThe pre-factor $\\frac{k_B T}{h}$ cancels. The problem states that the potential energy surface is isotope-invariant (Born-Oppenheimer approximation), so $V_0^{\\ddagger}$ is the same for both isotopologues and the term $\\exp(-V_0^{\\ddagger}/k_B T)$ also cancels. This leaves:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{H}}} \\frac{Q_{R,\\mathrm{D}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{D}}^{\\ddagger}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{\\mathrm{D}}^{\\ddagger}} \\frac{Q_{R,\\mathrm{D}}}{Q_{R,\\mathrm{H}}} $$\nThe total partition function $Q$ is a product of translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic partition functions: $Q = Q_{trans}Q_{rot}Q_{vib}Q_{elec}$. The problem explicitly states that all non-vibrational contributions (translational, rotational, electronic, and symmetry numbers) cancel in the KIE ratio. Therefore, the expression simplifies to the ratio of vibrational partition functions:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{Q_{vib,\\mathrm{H}}^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{vib,\\mathrm{D}}^{\\ddagger}} \\frac{Q_{vib,R,\\mathrm{D}}}{Q_{vib,R,\\mathrm{H}}} $$\nThe vibrational partition function for a molecule is the product of the partition functions for each of its vibrational modes. The problem is formulated under the harmonic approximation. The canonical partition function for a single harmonic oscillator of frequency $\\nu_i$, with energy levels measured from the bottom of the potential well, is:\n$$ q_{vib, i} = \\sum_{v=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h\\nu_i(v + 1/2)}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{\\exp(-h\\nu_i / (2k_B T))}{1 - \\exp(-h\\nu_i / k_B T)} $$\nThe numerator, $\\exp(-h\\nu_i / (2k_B T))$, accounts for the zero-point energy (ZPE) of the mode.\n\nThe total vibrational partition function for a species (Reactant or TS) is the product over all its stable vibrational modes: $Q_{vib} = \\prod_i q_{vib, i}$. The problem further simplifies this by stating that only a specified subset of modes is isotope-sensitive, and all other modes are identical and cancel out in the KIE ratio. Thus, the products need only be taken over the listed modes. Substituting the expression for $q_{vib,i}$ into the KIE ratio gives the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{H}}}{k_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\prod_{j \\in \\text{TS}_{\\mathrm{H}}} q_{vib,j} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i' \\in \\text{R}_{\\mathrm{D}}} q_{vib,i'} \\right)}{\\left( \\prod_{j' \\in \\text{TS}_{\\mathrm{D}}} q_{vib,j'} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i \\in \\text{R}_{\\mathrm{H}}} q_{vib,i} \\right)} $$\nThis is the required expression for the KIE in terms of products of harmonic vibrational partition functions.\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we define the dimensionless quantity $u_i = h\\nu_i/k_B T = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_i/k_B T$, where $\\tilde{\\nu}_i$ is the wavenumber.

From statistical mechanics, the rate constant for a unimolecular reaction is given by:\n$$\nk_{TST} = \\frac{k_B T}{h} K_c^{\\ddagger}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $K_c^{\\ddagger}$ is the equilibrium constant between the transition state (with the vibrational mode corresponding to the reaction coordinate factored out) and the reactants.\n\nThis equilibrium constant can be related to the standard Gibbs free energy of activation, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, by the thermodynamic relation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = -RT \\ln K^{\\ddagger}\n$$\nHere, $K^{\\ddagger}$ is the dimensionless equilibrium constant. For a gas-phase unimolecular reaction, $K^{\\ddagger} = K_c^{\\ddagger} / c^{\\circ}$ where $c^{\\circ}$ is the standard concentration. However, it is a known result of TST that for such reactions, the rate constant expression takes the form:\n$$\nk_{TST} = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Eyring equation. The standard Gibbs free energy of activation $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is related to the standard enthalpy of activation $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ and the standard entropy of activation $\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$ by the fundamental equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T \\Delta S^{\\ddagger}\n$$\nBy substituting the given values, we can calculate $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = (50.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) - (300.0\\,\\mathrm{K})(-10.0\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = 50000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} + 3000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 53000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}\n$$\nNow we compute the TST rate constant, $k_{TST}$:\n$$\nk_{TST} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})(300.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{53000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{(8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(300.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_{TST} = (6.25016... \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\exp(-21.2483...)\n$$\n$$\nk_{TST} = (6.25016... \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) (5.9180... \\times 10^{-10}) \\approx 3698.8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**Quantum Tunneling and the Wigner Correction**\n\nThe TST formalism is classical in its treatment of the motion along the reaction coordinate. Quantum mechanically, particles possess wave-like properties and can \"tunnel\" through a potential energy barrier even if they lack the classical energy to surmount it. This effect increases the overall reaction rate.\n\nThe Wigner correction provides the leading-order quantum correction to the classical TST rate. It is derived by considering the quantum mechanical transmission probability through a parabolic potential barrier, which approximates the shape of the true potential energy surface near the saddle point. The correction is valid under conditions where tunneling is a small perturbation, i.e., at high temperatures or for massive particles.\n\nThe Wigner-corrected rate constant, $k_W$, is given by:\n$$\nk_W = \\kappa_W(T) k_{TST}\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_W(T)$ is the Wigner tunneling correction factor:\n$$\n\\kappa_W(T) = 1 + \\frac{1}{24} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}\\right)^2\n$$\nHere, $\\omega^{\\ddagger}$ is the magnitude of the imaginary angular frequency corresponding to the unstable normal mode at the transition state. This frequency characterizes the curvature of the potential barrier. We are given the corresponding imaginary wavenumber, $\\tilde{\\nu}^{\\ddagger}$. The angular frequency is calculated as:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\ddagger} = 2\\pi c \\tilde{\\nu}^{\\ddagger}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\ddagger} = 2\\pi (2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}})(1000\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}) \\approx 1.88365 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nNow we compute the dimensionless quantity $u = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T}$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T} = \\frac{(\\frac{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}}{2\\pi})(1.88365... \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})(300.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}\n$$\n$$\nu = \\frac{1.98644... \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}} \\approx 4.79586\n$$\nThe Wigner correction factor is then:\n$$\n\\kappa_W(T) = 1 + \\frac{1}{24} (4.79586...)^2 = 1 + \\frac{23.0003...}{24} \\approx 1 + 0.95834... = 1.95834...\n$$\nFinally, the Wigner-corrected rate constant is:\n$$\nk_W = \\kappa_W(T) \\times k_{TST} = (1.95834...) \\times (3698.8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\approx 7243.6\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $7.24 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\n**Assessment of the Wigner Correction Reliability**\n\nThe Wigner correction is the result of a series expansion in the parameter $u^2 = (\\hbar \\omega^{\\ddagger}/k_B T)^2$. This expansion is only quantitatively reliable when the correction term is small compared to the leading term, which requires $u \\ll 1$. In this regime, the thermal energy $k_B T$ is much larger than the characteristic quantum energy of the barrier vibration, $\\hbar \\omega^{\\ddagger}$.\n\nIn this problem, we calculated:\n$$\nu = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega^{\\ddagger}}{k_B T} \\approx 4.80\n$$\nSince $u > 1$, the condition $u \\ll 1$ is severely violated. The correction term, $\\frac{1}{24}u^2 \\approx 0.96$, is of the same order of magnitude as the leading classical term ($1$). This indicates that the series expansion does not converge rapidly, and higher-order terms, which are neglected in the Wigner approximation, are likely significant. Therefore, the Wigner correction is not expected to be quantitatively reliable under these conditions. The system is in a deep quantum tunneling regime where a semi-classical approximation is insufficient. A more accurate calculation would require a full quantum-mechanical treatment of barrier transmission.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.24 \\times 10^3}$$", "id": "2683723"}]}
