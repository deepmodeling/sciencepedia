We proceed with the solution.\n\n(a) We are asked to derive the differential equation for the survival probability, $S(z)$. Let $S(z)$ be the probability that a projectile travels a distance $z$ without experiencing a collision. The probability of surviving to a distance $z+dz$ is the product of the probability of surviving to distance $z$ and the probability of not colliding in the infinitesimal interval $[z, z+dz]$. The annihilation events in disjoint intervals are stipulated to be independent.\n\nThe probability of at least one collision in the interval $[z, z+dz]$ is given to first order as $n(z)\\sigma dz$. Therefore, the probability of *no* collision in this interval is $1 - n(z)\\sigma dz$.\n\nWe can thus write the relation:\n$$ S(z+dz) = S(z) \\times (1 - n(z)\\sigma dz) $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ S(z+dz) - S(z) = -S(z)n(z)\\sigma dz $$\nDividing by $dz$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{S(z+dz) - S(z)}{dz} = -S(z)n(z)\\sigma $$\nIn the limit as $dz \\to 0$, the left-hand side becomes the definition of the derivative of $S(z)$ with respect to $z$. This gives the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dz} = -n(z)\\sigma S(z) $$\nThe initial condition is explicitly given as $S(0) = 1$, which signifies that the projectile starts at $z=0$ and has, by definition, not yet collided.\n\nTo solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation, we use the method of separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{S} = -n(z)\\sigma dz $$\nWe integrate both sides. The left side is integrated from the initial survival probability $S(0)=1$ to the probability $S(z)$, and the right side is integrated over the corresponding path from $z'=0$ to $z'=z$.\n$$ \\int_{S(0)}^{S(z)} \\frac{dS'}{S'} = -\\int_{0}^{z} n(z')\\sigma dz' $$\n$$ \\ln(S(z)) - \\ln(S(0)) = -\\sigma \\int_{0}^{z} n(z') dz' $$\nSubstituting the initial condition $S(0) = 1$, which means $\\ln(S(0)) = \\ln(1) = 0$, we find:\n$$ \\ln(S(z)) = -\\sigma \\int_{0}^{z} n(z') dz' $$\nExponentiating both sides provides the general solution for the survival probability:\n$$ S(z) = \\exp\\left(-\\sigma \\int_{0}^{z} n(z') dz'\\right) $$\n\n(b) Now we specialize to the case where the number density is given by $n(z) = \\frac{n_0}{1 + z/a}$. We first evaluate the integral in the exponent of $S(z)$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{z} n(z') dz' = \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{n_0}{1 + z'/a} dz' $$\nLet $u = 1 + z'/a$. Then $du = (1/a) dz'$, and the limits of integration change from $z'=0 \\to u=1$ to $z'=z \\to u=1+z/a$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{z} n(z') dz' = n_0 \\int_{1}^{1+z/a} \\frac{a}{u} du = n_0 a [\\ln|u|]_{1}^{1+z/a} = n_0 a (\\ln(1+z/a) - \\ln(1)) = n_0 a \\ln(1+z/a) $$\nSubstituting this result into the general solution for $S(z)$:\n$$ S(z) = \\exp(- \\sigma n_0 a \\ln(1+z/a)) $$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(k \\ln x) = x^k$, we simplify the expression for $S(z)$:\n$$ S(z) = \\left(1+\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{-\\sigma n_0 a} $$\nThe expected distance to the next collision, which we denote as $L$, is the expected value of the random variable representing the distance to the first collision. For a non-negative continuous random variable, the expected value can be computed by integrating its survival function from $0$ to $\\infty$. The survival function for the distance to the first collision is precisely $S(z)$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = \\int_0^\\infty S(z) dz $$\nWe substitute our specific form for $S(z)$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{z}{a}\\right)^{-\\sigma n_0 a} dz $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a substitution. Let $v = 1 + z/a$. Then $dv = (1/a) dz$, so $dz = a \\, dv$. The lower limit of integration $z=0$ corresponds to $v=1$, and the upper limit $z \\to \\infty$ corresponds to $v \\to \\infty$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} v^{-\\sigma n_0 a} (a \\, dv) = a \\int_{1}^{\\infty} v^{-\\sigma n_0 a} dv $$\nThis integral converges if and only if the exponent is less than $-1$, i.e., $-\\sigma n_0 a < -1$, which is equivalent to $\\sigma n_0 a > 1$. This condition is given in the problem statement, ensuring the mean free path is finite.\nWe now compute the definite integral:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = a \\left[ \\frac{v^{-\\sigma n_0 a + 1}}{-\\sigma n_0 a + 1} \\right]_{1}^{\\infty} $$\nSince $\\sigma n_0 a > 1$, the exponent $-\\sigma n_0 a + 1$ is negative. Thus, as $v \\to \\infty$, the term $v^{-\\sigma n_0 a + 1}$ approaches $0$. The evaluation yields:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = a \\left( 0 - \\frac{1^{-\\sigma n_0 a + 1}}{-\\sigma n_0 a + 1} \\right) = a \\left( - \\frac{1}{1 - \\sigma n_0 a} \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final result for the expected distance:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L] = \\frac{a}{\\sigma n_0 a - 1} $$\nThis expression has dimensions of length, as it should.

In the canonical ensemble, the probability density for a coordinate is proportional to the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-E/k_{B}T)$ times the appropriate phase-space measure. For a free rigid rotor in the absence of external fields, the energy $E$ does not depend on its instantaneous spatial orientation; hence, the orientational part of the Boltzmann factor is constant. Therefore, the orientation is distributed uniformly over the space of orientations, with respect to the invariant measure on orientations.

Accounting for an undirected axis. A homonuclear diatomic has an axis without a head or tail, so orientations $\\mathbf{n}$ and $-\\mathbf{n}$ are physically indistinguishable. The orientation space is the real projective plane, which is obtained by identifying antipodal points on the sphere. Equivalently, one may characterize an undirected orientation by the acute angle $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi/2]$ between the axis and any fixed direction (here, the line of centers) and an azimuthal angle $\\phi\\in[0,2\\pi)$.
