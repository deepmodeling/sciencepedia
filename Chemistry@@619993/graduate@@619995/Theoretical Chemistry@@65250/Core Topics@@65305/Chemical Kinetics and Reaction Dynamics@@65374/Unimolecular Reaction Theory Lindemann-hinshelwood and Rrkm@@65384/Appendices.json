In the high-pressure limit ($[\\mathrm{M}] \\to \\infty$), the term $k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}]$ dominates the denominator, so $k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_{2} \\approx k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}]$.\n$$\nk_{\\infty} = \\lim_{[\\mathrm{M}]\\to\\infty} k_{\\text{eff}} = \\lim_{[\\mathrm{M}]\\to\\infty} \\frac{k_{1} k_{2} [\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}]} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}\n$$\nIn the low-pressure limit ($[\\mathrm{M}] \\to 0$), the term $k_{2}$ dominates the denominator, so $k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] + k_{2} \\approx k_{2}$.

It is the ratio of the rate of energization to the rate of de-energization at the transition point. It is defined as:\n$$\nP_{r} \\equiv \\frac{k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{\\infty}}\n$$\nUsing this definition, $k_{\\text{eff}}$ can be written compactly as $k_{\\text{eff}} = k_{\\infty} \\frac{P_{r}}{1+P_{r}}$.\n\nThe physical meaning of the limits is as follows:\n- **$P_{r} \\ll 1$ (Low-Pressure Limit)**: This implies $k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}] \\ll k_{\\infty}$, which in terms of elementary constants is $k_{1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\ll \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}$, or $k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\ll k_{2}$. Physically, this means that the rate of collisional de-energization of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}$ ($k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}][\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}]$) is much slower than the rate of its unimolecular decomposition to products ($k_{2}[\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}]$). Consequently, nearly every energized molecule that is formed proceeds to products. The rate-determining step is the collisional activation step ($\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{A}^{\\ast} + \\mathrm{M}$), which is a bimolecular process. The overall reaction kinetics are second-order, with an effective rate constant $k_{\\text{eff}} \\approx k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}]$.\n\n- **$P_{r} \\gg 1$ (High-Pressure Limit)**: This implies $k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}] \\gg k_{\\infty}$, which simplifies to $k_{-1}[\\mathrm{M}] \\gg k_{2}$. Physically, the rate of collisional de-energization is much faster than the rate of product formation from $\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}$. An equilibrium is maintained between $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}$, where $[\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}] \\approx (k_{1}/k_{-1})[\\mathrm{A}]$. The rate-determining step is the unimolecular decomposition of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast}$ ($\\mathrm{A}^{\\ast} \\rightarrow \\text{Products}$). The overall reaction kinetics are first-order, and the rate constant approaches its maximum value, $k_{\\text{eff}} \\approx k_{\\infty}$.\n\n- **Connection to RRKM Theory**: The Lindemann-Hinshelwood model provides the conceptual framework but is quantitatively inaccurate, especially in the \"falloff\" region where $P_{r} \\sim 1$. RRKM theory provides a more rigorous, microcanonical treatment. It replaces the single rate constant $k_{2}$ with an energy-dependent microcanonical rate coefficient, $k(E)$. It explicitly considers the density of quantum states for the reactant and the sum of states for the transition state to calculate $k(E)$. The overall rate coefficient is then found by averaging over the thermal energy distribution of the reactant molecules. RRKM theory correctly predicts the shape of the falloff curve and provides a means to calculate $k_{0}$ and $k_{\\infty}$ from first principles based on molecular properties. The concepts of collisional activation being rate-limiting at low pressure and internal energy conversion being rate-limiting at high pressure are retained in RRKM theory but are described with much greater physical and mathematical sophistication.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nGiven the values:\n$k_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-30}\\ \\text{cm}^{3}\\ \\text{molecule}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\infty} = 3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$[\\mathrm{M}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$\n\nFirst, we compute the reduced pressure $P_{r}$:\n$$\nP_{r} = \\frac{k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{\\infty}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-30}\\ \\text{cm}^{3}\\ \\text{molecule}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) (1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\text{molecules}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3})}{3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nP_{r} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{3.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2.0}{3.0} \\times 10^{-17} \\approx 6.666... \\times 10^{-18}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $P_{r} = 6.67 \\times 10^{-18}$.\n\nNext, we compute the effective rate coefficient $k_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_{0}k_{\\infty}[\\mathrm{M}]}{k_{\\infty} + k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}]}\n$$\nThe product $k_{0}[\\mathrm{M}]$ is $2.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.

The classical TST rate constant, $k_{\\infty}^{\\text{cl}}(T)$, assumes that any particle with energy $E  E_0$ has zero probability of reacting. Quantum mechanics corrects this picture. The calculated value $\\kappa(E) \\approx 0.137$ for an energy *below* the barrier top demonstrates a non-zero reaction probability due to quantum tunneling. The overall quantum-corrected high-pressure rate constant is written as $k_{\\infty}(T) = \\kappa(T) k_{\\infty}^{\\text{cl}}(T)$, where $\\kappa(T)$ is the thermally averaged transmission coefficient. At low temperatures, the population of reactants with high energy is small, but tunneling allows the more significant population of reactants with energies below the barrier top ($E  E_0$) to contribute to the reaction. Because tunneling provides a reaction channel that is classically inaccessible, the quantum-corrected rate constant is larger than the classical one, meaning the tunneling correction factor, $\\kappa(T)$, is greater than 1. This effect is most significant at low temperatures, where tunneling can be the dominant reaction pathway.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.137}$$", "id": "2827680"}]}
