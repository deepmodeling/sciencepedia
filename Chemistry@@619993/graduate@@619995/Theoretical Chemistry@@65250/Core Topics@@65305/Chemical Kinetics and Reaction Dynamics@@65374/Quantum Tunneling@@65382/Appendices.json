In each iteration, compute the slice matrix $\\mathbf{P}_j$ based on the sign of $2(E-V_j)$ and update the total matrix by left-multiplication: $\\mathbf{P}_{total} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{P}_j \\, \\mathbf{P}_{total}$.\n6.  After iterating through all slices, extract the four elements of the final $\\mathbf{P}_{total}$.\n7.  Use the derived formula for $T$ to calculate the transmission coefficient.\nThis procedure will be implemented for all four test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the four test cases for quantum tunneling.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_transmission(params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the transmission coefficient for a single set of parameters.\n        The method uses the transfer matrix approach for the state vector (psi, psi').\n        \"\"\"\n        x_L, x_R, N, E, V_func = params\n        dx = (x_R - x_L) / N\n\n        if E = 0:\n            return 0.0\n        \n        k0 = np.sqrt(2 * E)\n\n        # Initialize the total propagation matrix\n        P_total = np.identity(2, dtype=np.float64)\n\n        # Define grid midpoints for potential evaluation\n        x_mids = x_L + dx / 2.0 + np.arange(N) * dx\n        \n        # Create an array of potential values for each slice\n        V_slices = V_func(x_mids)\n\n        # The total propagation matrix is P_N * P_{N-1} * ... * P_1\n        # Loop computes P_1, then P_2*P_1, then P_3*P_2*P_1, etc.\n        for i in range(N):\n            V = V_slices[i]\n            k_squared = 2 * (E - V)\n            \n            # This is the matrix for the i-th slice (P_{i+1} in formula)\n            P_slice = np.empty((2, 2), dtype=np.float64)\n\n            # E  V: Propagating region\n            if k_squared  0:\n                k = np.sqrt(k_squared)\n                # Handle k - 0 case for numerical stability\n                if np.abs(k * dx)  1e-9:\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = 1.0\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = dx\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = 0.0\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = 1.0\n                else:\n                    c = np.cos(k * dx)\n                    s = np.sin(k * dx)\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = c\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = s / k\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = -k * s\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = c\n            # E  V: Evanescent region\n            else:\n                kappa = np.sqrt(-k_squared)\n                # Handle kappa - 0 case (same as k - 0)\n                if np.abs(kappa * dx)  1e-9:\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = 1.0\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = dx\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = 0.0\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = 1.0\n                else:\n                    ch = np.cosh(kappa * dx)\n                    sh = np.sinh(kappa * dx)\n                    P_slice[0, 0] = ch\n                    P_slice[0, 1] = sh / kappa\n                    P_slice[1, 0] = kappa * sh\n                    P_slice[1, 1] = ch\n            \n            # Left-multiply to build P_i * P_{i-1} * ...\n            P_total = P_slice @ P_total\n\n        # Extract elements of the total propagation matrix\n        P11, P12, P21, P22 = P_total.flatten()\n        \n        # Calculate transmission coefficient T using the derived formula\n        denominator = (P21 - k0**2 * P12)**2 + (k0 * (P11 + P22))**2\n        \n        if denominator == 0:\n            # Should not happen for k0  0, but as a safeguard\n            return 1.0  # Physical limit for resonance\n\n        T = 4 * k0**2 / denominator\n        return T\n\n    # Common parameters for all test cases\n    x_L = -10.0\n    x_R = 10.0\n    N = 4000\n\n    # Test Case A: Single rectangular barrier, sub-barrier energy\n    V0_A = 0.5\n    a_A = 2.0\n    E_A = 0.2\n    V_func_A = lambda x: np.where(np.abs(x) = a_A / 2.0, V0_A, 0.0)\n    case_A = (x_L, x_R, N, E_A, V_func_A)\n\n    # Test Case B: Single rectangular barrier, high energy\n    V0_B = 0.5\n    a_B = 2.0\n    E_B = 2.0\n    V_func_B = lambda x: np.where(np.abs(x) = a_B / 2.0, V0_B, 0.0)\n    case_B = (x_L, x_R, N, E_B, V_func_B)\n\n    # Test Case C: No barrier, free propagation\n    E_C = 0.3\n    V_func_C = lambda x: np.zeros_like(x)\n    case_C = (x_L, x_R, N, E_C, V_func_C)\n\n    # Test Case D: Double barrier with a resonant well\n    V0_D = 0.6\n    b_D = 0.5\n    Lw_D = 4.0\n    E_D = 0.31\n    def V_func_D(x):\n        abs_x = np.abs(x)\n        return np.where((abs_x = Lw_D / 2.0)  (abs_x = Lw_D / 2.0 + b_D), V0_D, 0.0)\n    case_D = (x_L, x_R, N, E_D, V_func_D)\n\n    test_cases = [case_A, case_B, case_C, case_D]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = calculate_transmission(case)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Format the final output string as required\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2461151"}]}
