The group $G = C_{2v}$ consists of the four symmetry operations $\\{E, C_{2}(z), \\sigma_{v}(xz), \\sigma_{v}'(yz)\\}$. Let us denote these elements for brevity as $G = \\{e, a, b, c\\}$, where $e=E$, $a=C_{2}(z)$, $b=\\sigma_{v}(xz)$, and $c=\\sigma_{v}'(yz)$. The order of the group is $|G|=4$.\n\nThe class equation is an expression for the order of the group, $|G|$, as a sum of the sizes of its distinct conjugacy classes. The size of the conjugacy class $K(g)$ of an element $g \\in G$ is related to the size of its centralizer $C_{G}(g)$ by the orbit-stabilizer theorem for the conjugation action:\n$$ |K(g)| = \\frac{|G|}{|C_{G}(g)|} $$\nThe centralizer $C_{G}(g)$ is the set of all elements in $G$ that commute with $g$, defined as $C_{G}(g) = \\{h \\in G \\mid hg=gh\\}$.\n\nTo determine the centralizer for each element, we must first establish the multiplication table for the group $G$. The operations act on a general point $(x, y, z)$ in a Cartesian coordinate system as follows:\n-   $e(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)$ (Identity)\n-   $a(x, y, z) = (-x, -y, z)$ ($C_{2}$ rotation about the $z$-axis)\n-   $b(x, y, z) = (x, -y, z)$ (Reflection through the $xz$-plane)\n-   $c(x, y, z) = (-x, y, z)$ (Reflection through the $yz$-plane)\n\nLet us compute the products of these operations by sequential application. For example, consider the product $ab$:\n$$ (ab)(x, y, z) = a(b(x, y, z)) = a(x, -y, z) = (-x, -(-y), z) = (-x, y, z) = c(x, y, z) $$\nThus, $ab=c$.\n\nNow consider the product $ba$:\n$$ (ba)(x, y, z) = b(a(x, y, z)) = b(-x, -y, z) = (-x, -(-y), z) = (-x, y, z) = c(x, y, z) $$\nThus, $ba=c$. From these two results, we have $ab=ba$. The elements $a$ and $b$ commute.\n\nLet us examine the other products. It is trivial that any element commutes with itself and with the identity element $e$. We also check inverses.\n-   $a^2(x, y, z) = a(-x, -y, z) = (-(-x), -(-y), z) = (x, y, z) = e(x, y, z)$, so $a^2=e$.\n-   $b^2(x, y, z) = b(x, -y, z) = (x, -(-y), z) = (x, y, z) = e(x, y, z)$, so $b^2=e$.\n-   $c^2(x, y, z) = c(-x, y, z) = (-(-x), y, z) = (x, y, z) = e(x, y, z)$, so $c^2=e$.\nEvery element is its own inverse.\n\nThe full multiplication table for $G$ can be constructed. We already have $ab=c$ and $ba=c$.\n-   $ac = a(ab) = a^2b = eb = b$\n-   $ca = (ba)a = b(a^2) = be = b$\nSo, $ac=ca$. The elements $a$ and $c$ commute.\n-   $bc = b(ba) = b^2a = ea = a$\n-   $cb = (ab)b = a(b^2) = ae = a$\nSo, $bc=cb$. The elements $b$ and $c$ commute.\n\nThe multiplication table is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\cdot & e & a & b & c \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & a & b & c \\\\\na & a & e & c & b \\\\\nb & b & c & e & a \\\\\nc & c & b & a & e \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nFrom the symmetry of the multiplication table about its main diagonal ($gh=hg$ for all $g, h \\in G$), it is evident that the group $C_{2v}$ is an Abelian group.\n\nThe problem specifically requires a derivation based on the definition of the centralizer. For an arbitrary element $g \\in G$, its centralizer is $C_{G}(g) = \\{h \\in G \\mid hg=gh\\}$. Since we have rigorously proven that $hg=gh$ for all pairs of elements $h, g \\in G$, the centralizer of any element $g$ is the entire group $G$.\n$$ C_{G}(g) = G \\quad \\forall g \\in G $$\nThe size of the centralizer is therefore $|C_{G}(g)| = |G| = 4$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\nUsing the formula for the size of a conjugacy class, we can compute the size of the class for each element:\n-   For $g=e$: $|K(e)| = \\frac{|G|}{|C_{G}(e)|} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. The class is $K(e)=\\{e\\}$.\n-   For $g=a$: $|K(a)| = \\frac{|G|}{|C_{G}(a)|} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. The class is $K(a)=\\{a\\}$.\n-   For $g=b$: $|K(b)| = \\frac{|G|}{|C_{G}(b)|} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. The class is $K(b)=\\{b\\}$.\n-   For $g=c$: $|K(c)| = \\frac{|G|}{|C_{G}(c)|} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. The class is $K(c)=\\{c\\}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can use the definition of a conjugacy class directly: $K(g) = \\{hgh^{-1} \\mid h \\in G\\}$. Since the group is Abelian, $hgh^{-1} = ghh^{-1} = ge = g$ for any $h \\in G$. This immediately shows that the conjugacy class for any element $g$ contains only that element: $K(g) = \\{g\\}$. Therefore, the size of each conjugacy class is $1$. This confirms the result from the centralizer argument and fulfills the requirement to derive from first principles why each element is in its own class.\n\nThe group $G$ is partitioned into four distinct conjugacy classes, each of size $1$. The class equation is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint classes, which must equal the order of the group:\n$$ |G| = \\sum_{i} |K_{i}| $$\nSubstituting the sizes of the classes we have found:\n$$ 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 $$\nThis is the class equation for the point group $C_{2v}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1+1+1+1}\n$$", "id": "2775931"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the class structure that defines the columns of a character table, we now turn to constructing the entire table from scratch.

Since there are $3$ classes, there must be $3$ irreps. Let their dimensions be $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$.\n\nThe dimensions of these irreps are constrained by the second fact, often called the G.O.T. dimension theorem:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} d_i^2 = h$$\n$$d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 6$$\nSince the dimensions $d_i$ must be positive integers, the only unique solution to this Diophantine equation is $1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 6$. Therefore, the $C_{3v}$ group has two one-dimensional irreps ($d_1=1, d_2=1$) and one two-dimensional irrep ($d_3=2$).\n\nThe character table for $C_{3v}$ is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix where rows correspond to the irreps and columns to the conjugacy classes.

The characters must be real. The order of a $C_3$ operation is $3$, and the order of a $\\sigma_v$ operation is $2$.

We apply $\\hat{P}_{k}$ to a trial function, such as $\\phi_{1}=p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{1})$.\n\nFirst, we determine the transformation of $\\phi_{1}$ under all group operations:\n$E(\\phi_{1}) = \\phi_{1}$, $C_{2}(z)(\\phi_{1}) = -\\phi_{3}$, $C_{2}(y)(\\phi_{1}) = -\\phi_{3}$, $C_{2}(x)(\\phi_{1}) = \\phi_{1}$, $i(\\phi_{1}) = -\\phi_{3}$, $\\sigma(xy)(\\phi_{1}) = \\phi_{1}$, $\\sigma(xz)(\\phi_{1}) = \\phi_{1}$, $\\sigma(yz)(\\phi_{1}) = -\\phi_{3}$.\n\nNow we construct the SALC for the $B_{3u}$ irrep, which has characters $\\chi_{B_{3u}} = (1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1)$.\nLet $\\psi_{B_{3u}}$ be the unnormalized SALC.\n$\\psi_{B_{3u}} \\propto \\hat{P}_{B_{3u}}\\phi_{1} = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{g} [\\chi_{B_{3u}}(g)] (g\\phi_{1})$\n$\\psi_{B_{3u}} \\propto (1)E(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)C_{2}(z)(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)C_{2}(y)(\\phi_{1}) + (1)C_{2}(x)(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)i(\\phi_{1}) + (1)\\sigma(xy)(\\phi_{1}) + (1)\\sigma(xz)(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)\\sigma(yz)(\\phi_{1})$\n$\\psi_{B_{3u}} \\propto (1)(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)(-\\phi_{3}) + (-1)(-\\phi_{3}) + (1)(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)(-\\phi_{3}) + (1)(\\phi_{1}) + (1)(\\phi_{1}) + (-1)(-\\phi_{3})$\n$\\psi_{B_{3u}} \\propto \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} + \\phi_{3} + \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} + \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} = 4\\phi_{1} + 4\\phi_{3}$\nSo, the unnormalized SALC is $\\psi_{B_{3u}} = \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} = p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{1}) + p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{2})$.\n\nTo normalize this SALC, let $\\Psi_{B_{3u}} = N(\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3})$. We require the integral $\\langle \\Psi_{B_{3u}} | \\Psi_{B_{3u}} \\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle N(\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3}) | N(\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3}) \\rangle = N^{2} \\langle \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} | \\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3} \\rangle = 1$.\nExpanding this, we get $N^{2} (\\langle \\phi_{1} | \\phi_{1} \\rangle + \\langle \\phi_{3} | \\phi_{3} \\rangle + 2\\langle \\phi_{1} | \\phi_{3} \\rangle) = 1$.\nThe atomic orbitals are individually normalized, so $\\langle \\phi_{1} | \\phi_{1} \\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle \\phi_{3} | \\phi_{3} \\rangle = 1$. As they are centered on different atoms, they are treated as orthogonal for the purpose of constructing SALCs, so $\\langle\\phi_{i}|\\phi_{j}\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$.\n$N^{2} (1 + 1) = 2N^{2} = 1$, which gives $N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe normalized SALC is $\\Psi_{B_{3u}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\phi_{1} + \\phi_{3}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{1}) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{2})$.\n\nFor completeness, we note the other SALCs can be derived similarly:\n- Projecting $\\phi_1$ with $A_g$ yields $\\Psi_{A_g} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\phi_1 - \\phi_3)$.\n- Projecting a different trial function, $\\phi_2=p_y(C_1)$, with $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2u}$ yields $\\Psi_{B_{1g}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\phi_2 - \\phi_4)$ and $\\Psi_{B_{2u}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\phi_2 + \\phi_4)$.\n\n**Final Extraction**\nThe problem asks for the coefficient multiplying $p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{1})$ in the normalized SALC that transforms as the $B_{3u}$ irreducible representation.\nFrom the derived expression $\\Psi_{B_{3u}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{1}) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{2})$, the coefficient of $p_{x}(\\mathrm{C}_{1})$ is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}$$", "id": "2775918"}]}
