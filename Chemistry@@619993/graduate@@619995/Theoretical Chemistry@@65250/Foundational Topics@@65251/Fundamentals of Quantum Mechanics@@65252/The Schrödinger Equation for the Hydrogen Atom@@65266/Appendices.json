For a system in a stationary state with a potential of the form $V(r) = A r^k$, the virial theorem establishes the relationship $2\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle = k\\langle \\hat{V} \\rangle$.

Now, we substitute $\\langle \\hat{T} \\rangle_n = -E_n$ into our expression for the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_n}{\\partial \\mu} = -\\frac{(-E_n)}{\\mu} = \\frac{E_n}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis is a correct intermediate result. However, the problem requires the final expression to be in terms of the principal quantum number $n$ and fundamental constants $e$, $\\hbar$, and $\\epsilon_0$.

This implies that as the reduced mass $\\mu$ increases, the energy eigenvalue $E_n$ decreases (becomes more negative). A more negative energy corresponds to a more tightly bound system. The ionization energy, given by $|E_n|$, increases with $\\mu$. In the context of isotopic substitution, consider protium (nucleus is a proton, $m_p$) and deuterium (nucleus is a deuteron, $m_d$). The reduced mass is given by $\\mu = m_e m_{nuc} / (m_e + m_{nuc})$. Since $m_d \\approx 2m_p$, the reduced mass of the deuterium atom, $\\mu_D$, is slightly larger than that of the protium atom, $\\mu_P$. Consequently, $E_n(\\text{deuterium}) < E_n(\\text{protium})$. This phenomenon is known as the isotope shift, and it leads to a small shift in the spectral lines of deuterium to higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) compared to protium, because the energy differences between levels are slightly larger.\n\nThe scaling of the result is with $1/n^2$. The magnitude of the derivative, $|\\partial E_n/\\partial\\mu|$, is proportional to $1/n^2$. This indicates that the sensitivity of the energy levels to a change in reduced mass is greatest for the lowest energy state (the ground state, $n=1$) and decreases rapidly for higher excited states. Therefore, the absolute energy shift due to isotopic substitution is most significant for the ground state and for transitions involving states with small values of $n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{e^{4}}{32\\pi^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2}\\hbar^{2}n^{2}}}$$", "id": "2821945"}]}
