This exercise provides foundational practice by tasking you with analyzing the distinct symmetries of cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. By applying the fundamental definitions of rotations, reflections, and inversions to these simple planar isomers, you will see how a change in stereochemistry directly determines the molecular point group and its associated properties [@problem_id:2906237].", "problem": "A planar alkene with formula $\\mathrm{C_2H_2Cl_2}$ can exist as a cis isomer and a trans isomer at equilibrium, both adopting a rigid, planar geometry due to the $\\pi$ bond. Consider the two stereoisomers cis-1,2-dichloroethylene and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. Model each molecule as exactly planar with the carbon–carbon double bond along the $x$-axis in the $xy$-plane, and the $z$-axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. Place the carbon nuclei at $(x,y,z)=(\\pm a,0,0)$ with $a0$, and attach substituents on each carbon such that all four substituents lie in the $xy$-plane with no deviation along $z$. In the cis isomer, the two chlorine atoms lie on the same side of the $x$-axis (same sign of $y$), and the two hydrogen atoms lie on the opposite side. In the trans isomer, the chlorine atom on the left carbon and the chlorine atom on the right carbon lie on opposite sides of the $x$-axis (opposite signs of $y$), with the hydrogens arranged correspondingly.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of molecular symmetry operations in three-dimensional space—namely, identity, proper rotation $C_n$ about an axis, mirror reflection $\\sigma$ in a plane, and inversion $i$ through a point—determine, for each isomer, the complete set of symmetry elements (axes, planes, center) that map the molecule onto itself, and identify the principal rotation axis as the one with highest order. Then, from these symmetry elements, deduce the point group of each isomer strictly by definition (do not quote classification tables without justification).\n\nFinally, let $N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis})$ be the total number of distinct mirror planes present in cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, and let $N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans})$ be the corresponding number for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene.

From this, a quantity $M$ must be computed, which is the difference in the number of mirror planes between the two isomers.\n\nThe analysis is performed by systematically applying the definitions of symmetry operations—identity ($E$), proper rotation ($C_n$), reflection ($\\sigma$), and inversion ($i$)—to the specified molecular geometries. The coordinate system is defined with the carbon-carbon double bond along the $x$-axis, the molecule in the $xy$-plane, and the carbon atoms at $(\\pm a, 0, 0)$ where $a  0$.\n\nAnalysis of cis-1,2-dichloroethylene:\n\nIn the cis isomer, both chlorine atoms are on one side of the $x$-axis (e.g., positive $y$ coordinates), and both hydrogen atoms are on the other side (negative $y$ coordinates). The molecule is planar and resides in the $xy$-plane.\n\n1.  Identity ($E$): The identity operation leaves the molecule unchanged and is always a symmetry element.\n\n2.  Proper Rotation ($C_n$): We test for rotation axes that map the molecule onto an indistinguishable configuration.\n    - An axis along the C=C bond (the $x$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation would exchange the positions of atoms with positive $y$ coordinates with those with negative $y$ coordinates. This would map chlorine atoms to hydrogen atoms, so it is not a symmetry operation.\n    - An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (the $z$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation around the $z$-axis through the origin would map a point $(x, y, 0)$ to $(-x, -y, 0)$. This would map the left side of the molecule to the right side while also inverting the $y$ coordinate, again mapping chlorine atoms to hydrogen positions. This is not a symmetry operation.\n    - An axis in the molecular plane that bisects the C=C bond (the $y$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation around the $y$-axis maps a point $(x, y, z)$ to $(-x, y, -z)$. For atoms in the $xy$-plane, this is $(x, y, 0) \\to (-x, y, 0)$. This operation exchanges the carbon atom at $(-a, 0, 0)$ with the one at $(a, 0, 0)$. It also exchanges the chlorine atom on the left carbon with the chlorine atom on the right carbon, as they both have the same $y$ coordinate. Similarly, it exchanges the two hydrogen atoms. Thus, a $C_2$ axis exists along the $y$-axis. No higher-order rotation axes are present. This $C_2$ axis is the principal axis of rotation.\n\n3.  Mirror Reflection ($\\sigma$): We test for planes of reflection.\n    - The molecular plane ($xy$-plane, equation $z=0$): Reflection through this plane maps $(x, y, z) \\to (x, y, -z)$. Since all atoms lie in this plane ($z=0$), they are not moved. This is a valid symmetry operation. This plane is a mirror plane, which we denote $\\sigma(xy)$.\n    - A plane perpendicular to the C=C bond and bisecting it (the $yz$-plane, equation $x=0$): Reflection through this plane maps $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, y, z)$. This operation exchanges the left and right sides of the molecule and, like the $C_2(y)$ rotation, maps identical atoms onto each other. This is a valid symmetry operation. This plane is a mirror plane, which we denote $\\sigma(yz)$.\n    - A plane containing the C=C bond (the $xz$-plane, equation $y=0$): Reflection through this plane maps $(x, y, z) \\to (x, -y, z)$. This would map chlorine atoms (positive $y$) to hydrogen positions (negative $y$). This is not a symmetry operation.\n\n4.  Inversion ($i$): Inversion through the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ maps $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, -z)$. This operation would map a chlorine atom (positive $y$) to a hydrogen position (negative $y$) on the opposite side. It is not a symmetry operation.\n\nSummary for cis-1,2-dichloroethylene:\nThe symmetry elements are a $C_2$ axis (the $y$-axis), and two mirror planes, $\\sigma(xy)$ and $\\sigma(yz)$. The corresponding symmetry operations are $E$, $C_2(y)$, $\\sigma(xy)$, and $\\sigma(yz)$. The principal axis is the $C_2$ axis. Both mirror planes, $\\sigma(xy)$ and $\\sigma(yz)$, contain the principal $C_2(y)$ axis. A point group with a $C_n$ axis and $n$ mirror planes containing the axis is designated $C_{nv}$. Here, with $n=2$, the point group is $C_{2v}$.\nThe total number of distinct mirror planes is two. Therefore, $N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis}) = 2$.\n\nAnalysis of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene:\n\nIn the trans isomer, the two chlorine atoms are on opposite sides of the $x$-axis. The two hydrogen atoms are also on opposite sides. The arrangement is centrosymmetric.\n\n1.  Identity ($E$): Present.\n\n2.  Proper Rotation ($C_n$):\n    - An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (the $z$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation around the $z$-axis maps a point $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, z)$. For atoms in the $xy$-plane, this is $(x, y, 0) \\to (-x, -y, 0)$. This operation maps the carbon at $(-a, 0, 0)$ to $(a, 0, 0)$. It maps the chlorine atom on the left carbon (e.g., positive $y$) to the chlorine atom on the right carbon (negative $y$). Likewise, it maps the hydrogen on the left carbon (negative $y$) to the hydrogen on the right carbon (positive $y$). This is a valid symmetry operation. A $C_2$ axis exists along the $z$-axis. It is the principal axis.\n\n3.  Mirror Reflection ($\\sigma$):\n    - The molecular plane ($xy$-plane, equation $z=0$): Reflection through this plane leaves all atoms unmoved and is a symmetry operation. This is a horizontal plane of symmetry, $\\sigma_h$, as it is perpendicular to the principal $C_2(z)$ axis. We denote it $\\sigma(xy)$.\n    - No other mirror planes exist. A plane like $\\sigma(yz)$ or $\\sigma(xz)$ would map at least one chlorine atom to a position occupied by a hydrogen atom.\n\n4.  Inversion ($i$): Inversion through the origin maps $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, -z)$. This operation correctly maps the carbon atoms to each other. It also maps the chlorine atom on the left carbon to the chlorine atom on the right carbon, and the hydrogen atom on the left to the hydrogen atom on the right. Thus, a center of inversion exists at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\nSummary for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene:\nThe symmetry elements are a $C_2$ axis (the $z$-axis), a center of inversion $i$, and one mirror plane $\\sigma(xy)$. The corresponding symmetry operations are $E$, $C_2(z)$, $i$, and $\\sigma_h = \\sigma(xy)$. The principal axis is the $C_2$ axis. The presence of a mirror plane $\\sigma_h$ perpendicular to the $C_n$ axis defines the point group as $C_{nh}$. Here, with $n=2$, the point group is $C_{2h}$.\nThe total number of distinct mirror planes is one. Therefore, $N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans}) = 1$.\n\nCalculation of $M$:\n\nThe problem asks for the quantity $M = N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis}) - N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans})$.\nBased on the analysis:\n$N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis}) = 2$\n$N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans}) = 1$\nTherefore, the value of $M$ is:\n$$\nM = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2906237"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply listing symmetry elements, a deeper understanding of a point group comes from its underlying mathematical structure.

Justify from first principles that the set is closed under composition and that the composition is associative.\nTask 2: Compute the total number $N$ of ordered pairs $(g,h)$ with $g,h \\in C_{3v}$ such that the elements commute, i.e., $g h = h g$.\n\nStep 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens.\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The relations $r^{3} = E$, $s^{2} = E$, and $srs = r^{-1}$ are the standard presentation of the dihedral group of order $6$, denoted $D_{3}$. This group is isomorphic to the point group $C_{3v}$, which correctly describes the symmetry of molecules like ammonia ($NH_{3}$). The problem is thus a standard exercise in group theory as applied to chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (generators, relations, and the set of elements) to perform the requested tasks. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution.\n\nThe group $C_{3v}$ is generated by $r$ and $s$ with the given relations. Any element of the group can be written in the form $r^{i}s^{j}$ where $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ unique elements: $r^{0}s^{0}=E$, $r^{1}s^{0}=r$, $r^{2}s^{0}=r^{2}$, $r^{0}s^{1}=s$, $r^{1}s^{1}=rs$, and $r^{2}s^{1}=r^{2}s$. The provided set $G = \\{E, r, r^{2}, s, r s, r^{2} s\\}$ is therefore the complete set of elements for the group. The order of the group is $|G|=6$.\n\nTo construct the Cayley table, we need a consistent way to simplify products. From $r^{3} = E$, it follows that $r \\cdot r^{2} = E$, which implies $r^{-1} = r^{2}$. The third relation $srs = r^{-1}$ can thus be rewritten as $srs = r^{2}$. By left-multiplying by $s$ (and using $s^{2}=E$), we get $s(srs) = sr^{2}$, which simplifies to $rs = sr^{2}$. Alternatively, right-multiplying $srs = r^{2}$ by $s$ gives $sr(s^{2}) = r^{2}s$, which simplifies to $sr = r^{2}s$. These commutation rules, $sr = r^{2}s$ and $sr^{2} = rs$, are sufficient to compute all products.\n\nTask 1: Cayley Table and Justification of Properties.\n\nWe compute the $36$ products $gh$ for all $g,h \\in G$.\nThe rows are indexed by the first element of the product, and columns by the second.\n\nFor $g=E$: The row is $\\{E, r, r^{2}, s, r s, r^{2} s\\}$.\nFor $g=r$: $rE=r, r r=r^{2}, r r^{2}=r^{3}=E, rs, r(rs)=r^{2}s, r(r^{2}s)=r^{3}s=s$. The row is $\\{r, r^{2}, E, rs, r^{2}s, s\\}$.\nFor $g=r^{2}$: $r^{2}E=r^{2}, r^{2}r=E, r^{2}r^{2}=r^{4}=r, r^{2}s, r^{2}(rs)=r^{3}s=s, r^{2}(r^{2}s)=r^{4}s=rs$. The row is $\\{r^{2}, E, r, r^{2}s, s, rs\\}$.\nFor $g=s$: $sE=s, sr=r^{2}s, sr^{2}=rs, s^{2}=E, s(rs)=(sr)s=(r^{2}s)s=r^{2}s^{2}=r^{2}, s(r^{2}s)=(sr^{2})s=(rs)s=rs^{2}=r$. The row is $\\{s, r^{2}s, rs, E, r^{2}, r\\}$.\nFor $g=rs$: $(rs)E=rs, (rs)r=r(sr)=r(r^{2}s)=r^{3}s=s, (rs)r^{2}=r(sr^{2})=r(rs)=r^{2}s, (rs)s=rs^{2}=r, (rs)(rs)=r(sr)s=r(r^{2}s)s=r^{3}s^{2}=E, (rs)(r^{2}s)=r(sr^{2})s=r(rs)s=r^{2}s^{2}=r^{2}$. The row is $\\{rs, s, r^{2}s, r, E, r^{2}\\}$.\nFor $g=r^{2}s$: $(r^{2}s)E=r^{2}s, (r^{2}s)r=r^{2}(sr)=r^{2}(r^{2}s)=r^{4}s=rs, (r^{2}s)r^{2}=r^{2}(sr^{2})=r^{2}(rs)=r^{3}s=s, (r^{2}s)s=r^{2}s^{2}=r^{2}, (r^{2}s)(rs)=r^{2}(sr)s=r^{2}(r^{2}s)s=r^{4}s^{2}=r, (r^{2}s)(r^{2}s)=r^{2}(sr^{2})s=r^{2}(rs)s=r^{3}s^{2}=E$.

This demonstrates empirically that the set is closed under the defined composition operation.\n\nJustification of Associativity: The problem defines the symmetry operations as bijective mappings on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and their composition as function composition. The composition of functions is inherently associative. For any three such mappings $f, g, h$, it is a fundamental property that $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$. Since the group operation is function composition, associativity is guaranteed from first principles and does not require empirical verification from the table.\n\nTask 2: Number of Commuting Pairs.\n\nWe are asked to find the number $N$ of ordered pairs $(g,h)$ with $g,h \\in G$ such that $gh = hg$. A powerful result from group theory states that the total number of commuting pairs in a finite group $G$ is given by the product of the order of the group and the number of its conjugacy classes. That is, $N = k|G|$, where $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes.\n\nThe order of our group is $|G|=6$. We must determine the number of conjugacy classes. A conjugacy class of an element $a \\in G$ is the set $Cl(a) = \\{gag^{-1} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n1. The identity element $E$ always forms its own class: $Cl(E) = \\{gEg^{-1}\\} = \\{E\\}$.\n2.

The conjugacy class of $s$:\n$E s E^{-1} = s$\n$s s s^{-1} = s$\n$r s r^{-1} = r s r^{2} = r(sr^{2}) = r(rs) = r^{2}s$\n$r^{2} s (r^{2})^{-1} = r^{2} s r = r^{2}(sr) = r^{2}(r^{2}s) = r^{4}s = rs$\nThe elements $\\{s, rs, r^{2}s\\}$ are conjugates. We do not need to check further, as these three elements form a complete class. $Cl(s) = \\{s, rs, r^{2}s\\}$.\n\nThe group $G$ is partitioned into three disjoint conjugacy classes:\n$C_{1} = \\{E\\}$\n$C_{2} = \\{r, r^{2}\\}$\n$C_{3} = \\{s, rs, r^{2}s\\}$\nThe total number of conjugacy classes is $k=3$.\n\nUsing the formula $N=k|G|$, we find the number of commuting pairs:\n$N = 3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\nThis result can be verified by a direct counting method, which is equivalent to finding the sum of the sizes of the centralizers for each element, $N = \\sum_{g \\in G} |C_G(g)|$, where $C_G(g)=\\{h \\in G \\mid gh=hg\\}$.\n- $g=E$: commutes with all $6$ elements. $|C_G(E)|=6$.\n- $g=r$: commutes with $\\{E, r, r^{2}\\}$. $|C_G(r)|=3$.\n- $g=r^{2}$: commutes with $\\{E, r, r^{2}\\}$. $|C_G(r^{2})|=3$.\n- $g=s$: commutes with $\\{E, s\\}$. $|C_G(s)|=2$.\n- $g=rs$: commutes with $\\{E, rs\\}$. $|C_G(rs)|=2$.\n- $g=r^{2}s$: commutes with $\\{E, r^{2}s\\}$. $|C_G(r^{2}s)|=2$.\nThe sum is $N = 6 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18$.\nThe two methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18}$$", "id": "2906267"}, {"introduction": "The true power of group theory in chemistry lies in its ability to simplify complex quantum mechanical problems.

As a consistency check, the sum of the dimensions of the irreps, weighted by their multiplicities, must equal the dimension of the reducible representation. The dimension of a representation is its character for the identity element, $\\chi(\\mathrm{E})$. All irreps of $C_{2v}$ are one-dimensional, i.e., $\\chi^{\\alpha}(\\mathrm{E})=1$ for all $\\alpha$. The dimension of $\\Gamma$ is $\\chi^{\\Gamma}(\\mathrm{E}) = 12$.\nThe sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\alpha} a_{\\alpha} \\chi^{\\alpha}(\\mathrm{E}) = (5)(1) + (1)(1) + (3)(1) + (3)(1) = 5 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12\n$$\nThis sum matches the dimension of $\\Gamma$, confirming the correctness of the decomposition. The result is that the reducible representation $\\Gamma$ decomposes as $\\Gamma = 5A_1 \\oplus 1A_2 \\oplus 3B_1 \\oplus 3B_2$. The multiplicities are to be reported as a row matrix in the order $(A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5  1  3  3 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2787794"}]}
