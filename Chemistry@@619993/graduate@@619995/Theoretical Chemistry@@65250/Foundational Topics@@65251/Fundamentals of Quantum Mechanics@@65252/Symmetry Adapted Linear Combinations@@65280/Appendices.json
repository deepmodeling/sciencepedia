The $\\hat{C}_2'(y)$ axis passes through $2$ and $4$. In both cases, two orbitals are unshifted. $\\chi(C_2') = 2$.\n- $2\\hat{C}_2''$: These axes bisect the coordinate axes, so all ligands are moved. $\\chi(C_2'') = 0$.\n- $\\hat{i}$: Inversion maps each ligand to the one on the opposite side. All are moved. $\\chi(i) = 0$.\n- $2\\hat{S}_4(z)$: All orbitals are moved. $\\chi(S_4) = 0$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_h(xy)$: The $\\sigma$-orbitals are in the $xy$-plane and are typically symmetric with respect to this plane. All $4$ are unshifted. $\\chi(\\sigma_h) = 4$.\n- $2\\hat{\\sigma}_v$: The $\\sigma_v(xz)$ plane contains ligands $1$ and $3$. The $\\sigma_v(yz)$ plane contains ligands $2$ and $4$.

For a $\\sigma$-interaction to occur, the metal orbital and the ligand SALC must belong to the same irrep. The $\\sigma$-ligand orbitals provide SALCs of $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ symmetry. Therefore, the metal orbitals $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ can couple to these SALCs. The other $d$ orbitals ($d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$) have symmetries ($B_{2g}, E_g$) not present in the g-parity part of $\\Gamma_{\\sigma}$ and are thus non-bonding in a pure $\\sigma$-framework.\n\nTo construct the SALCs, we use the projection operator $\\hat{P}_k \\propto \\sum_R \\chi_k(R) \\hat{R}$ on a starting orbital, e.g., $\\chi^{(\\sigma)}_1$.\nFor $A_{1g}$, all characters are $+1$.

A $p_z$ orbital is antisymmetric with respect to reflection in the $xy$-plane.\nThe characters are found by considering the transformation of both the positions and the $p_z$ vectors.\n- $\\hat{E}$: $\\chi(E) = 4$.\n- Operations that move all atoms ($C_4, C_2, C_2'', i, S_4, \\sigma_d$): character is $0$.\n- $\\hat{C}_2'$ (e.g., $x$-axis): ligands $1$ and $3$ are unshifted. The operation rotates $z$ to $-z$, so $p_z \\to -p_z$. Contribution is $2(-1) = -2$. Thus $\\chi(C_2')=-2$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_h(xy)$: all ligands unshifted. $p_z \\to -p_z$ for each. $\\chi(\\sigma_h) = 4(-1)=-4$.\n- $\\hat{\\sigma}_v$ (e.g., $xz$-plane): ligands $1$ and $3$ are unshifted. The reflection plane contains the $p_z$ direction, so $p_z \\to p_z$. Contribution is $2(1)=2$. Thus $\\chi(\\sigma_v)=2$.\n\nThe character vector for $\\Gamma_{p_z}$ is $(4, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, 0, -4, 2, 0)$.\nDecomposition yields $\\Gamma_{p_z} = A_{2u} \\oplus B_{2u} \\oplus E_g$.\nThe metal $d$ orbitals relevant for $\\pi$-bonding are $d_{xy} (B_{2g})$ and $(d_{xz}, d_{yz}) (E_g)$. All $d$ orbitals have $g$ (gerade) parity under inversion.\nFor coupling to occur, the ligand SALC must have the same irrep and parity as the metal orbital.\n- The $A_{2u}$ and $B_{2u}$ SALCs have $u$ (ungerade) parity. Their overlap with any $g$-parity $d$ orbital is strictly zero.\n- The $E_g$ SALCs have $g$ parity and match the symmetry of the $(d_{xz}, d_{yz})$ pair of metal orbitals.\n- The $d_{xy}$ orbital has $B_{2g}$ symmetry. There is no corresponding $B_{2g}$ SALC from the $p_z$ set, so there is no coupling.\nTherefore, only the $E_g$ irreducible representation from the ligand $p_z$ set can couple to metal $d$ orbitals, specifically the $(d_{xz}, d_{yz})$ pair, via $\\pi$-interaction.\n\nPart 3: Tight-binding model\n\nWe set up the Hamiltonian matrix for the interaction between the metal $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and the ligand $\\sigma$-SALC of $B_{1g}$ symmetry. The basis is $\\{|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle, |\\psi(B_{1g})\\rangle\\}$, where $|\\psi(B_{1g})\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi_1 - \\chi_2 + \\chi_3 - \\chi_4)$. For simplicity, we drop the $(\\sigma)$ superscript.\n\nThe diagonal matrix elements are given as:\n$H_{11} = \\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | d_{x^2-y^2} \\rangle = \\alpha_d$.\n$H_{22} = \\langle \\psi(B_{1g}) | \\hat{H} | \\psi(B_{1g}) \\rangle = \\alpha_{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe off-diagonal element $H_{12}$ is calculated:\n$$ H_{12} = \\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | \\psi(B_{1g}) \\rangle = \\left\\langle d_{x^2-y^2} \\left| \\hat{H} \\right| \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi_1 - \\chi_2 + \\chi_3 - \\chi_4) \\right\\rangle $$\n$$ H_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | \\chi_1 \\rangle - \\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | \\chi_2 \\rangle + \\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | \\chi_3 \\rangle - \\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | \\chi_4 \\rangle \\right] $$\nUsing the given interaction integrals $\\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | \\hat{H} | \\chi_i \\rangle = s_i \\beta_{\\sigma}$, with $s_1=s_3=1$ and $s_2=s_4=-1$:\n$$ H_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} [ (1)\\beta_{\\sigma} - (-1)\\beta_{\\sigma} + (1)\\beta_{\\sigma} - (-1)\\beta_{\\sigma} ] = \\frac{1}{2} [4\\beta_{\\sigma}] = 2\\beta_{\\sigma} $$\nThe secular determinant for the orthonormal basis is:\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} \\alpha_d - E & 2\\beta_{\\sigma} \\\\ 2\\beta_{\\sigma} & \\alpha_{\\sigma} - E \\end{vmatrix} = 0 $$\nExpanding the determinant gives the quadratic equation:\n$$ (\\alpha_d - E)(\\alpha_{\\sigma} - E) - (2\\beta_{\\sigma})^2 = 0 $$\n$$ E^2 - (\\alpha_d + \\alpha_{\\sigma})E + \\alpha_d \\alpha_{\\sigma} - 4\\beta_{\\sigma}^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions for the energy eigenvalues $E$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ E = \\frac{(\\alpha_d + \\alpha_{\\sigma}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\alpha_d + \\alpha_{\\sigma})^2 - 4(\\alpha_d \\alpha_{\\sigma} - 4\\beta_{\\sigma}^2)}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{(\\alpha_d + \\alpha_{\\sigma}) \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha_d^2 + 2\\alpha_d \\alpha_{\\sigma} + \\alpha_{\\sigma}^2 - 4\\alpha_d \\alpha_{\\sigma} + 16\\beta_{\\sigma}^2}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{(\\alpha_d + \\alpha_{\\sigma}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\alpha_d - \\alpha_{\\sigma})^2 + 16\\beta_{\\sigma}^2}}{2} $$\nThe problem asks for the lower-energy (bonding) eigenvalue, denoted $E_{b_{1g},-}$, which corresponds to the negative sign in the solution.\n$$ E_{b_{1g},-} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\alpha_d + \\alpha_{\\sigma}) - \\sqrt{(\\alpha_d - \\alpha_{\\sigma})^2 + 16\\beta_{\\sigma}^2} \\right] $$\nThis is the required expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\alpha_{d} + \\alpha_{\\sigma} - \\sqrt{(\\alpha_{d} - \\alpha_{\\sigma})^{2} + 16\\beta_{\\sigma}^{2}} \\right)}$$", "id": "2809955"}]}
