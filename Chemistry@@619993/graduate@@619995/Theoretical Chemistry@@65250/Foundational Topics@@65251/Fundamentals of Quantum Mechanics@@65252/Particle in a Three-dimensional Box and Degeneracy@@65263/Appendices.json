Do not approximate.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It is a standard exercise in introductory quantum mechanics and is therefore valid. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the stationary-state energies. The time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional potential $V(x,y,z)$ is given by:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2}\\psi(x,y,z) + V(x,y,z)\\psi(x,y,z) = E\\psi(x,y,z)\n$$\nInside the cubic box of edge length $L$, the potential $V(x,y,z) = 0$. The TISE simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial z^{2}}\\right) = E\\psi\n$$\nThe boundary conditions state that the wavefunction $\\psi(x,y,z)$ vanishes on the faces of the cube, where $x=0$, $x=L$, $y=0$, $y=L$, $z=0$, or $z=L$.\n\nWe employ the method of separation of variables, assuming the wavefunction can be written as a product of three independent functions, each of a single variable:\n$$\n\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the TISE and subsequently dividing by $\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$ yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left(\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}} + \\frac{1}{Z(z)}\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dz^{2}}\\right) = E\n$$\nThe equation is arranged such that each term on the left-hand side is a function of only one independent variable ($x$, $y$, or $z$). Since their sum is a constant, $E$, each term must individually be a constant. We can write:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} = -k_{x}^{2} \\quad , \\quad \\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}} = -k_{y}^{2} \\quad , \\quad \\frac{1}{Z(z)}\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dz^{2}} = -k_{z}^{2}\n$$\nwhere $k_{x}$, $k_{y}$, and $k_{z}$ are separation constants. This leads to a set of three ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} = -k_{x}^{2}X(x) \\quad , \\quad \\frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}} = -k_{y}^{2}Y(y) \\quad , \\quad \\frac{d^{2}Z}{dz^{2}} = -k_{z}^{2}Z(z)\n$$\nAnd the total energy $E$ is related to these constants by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}(k_{x}^{2} + k_{y}^{2} + k_{z}^{2}) = E\n$$\nLet us solve the equation for $X(x)$. Its general solution is:\n$$\nX(x) = A\\sin(k_{x}x) + B\\cos(k_{x}x)\n$$\nThe boundary condition $\\psi(0,y,z) = 0$ implies $X(0) = 0$. Applying this:\n$$\nX(0) = A\\sin(0) + B\\cos(0) = B = 0\n$$\nThus, the solution must be of the form $X(x) = A\\sin(k_{x}x)$. The second boundary condition, $\\psi(L,y,z)=0$, implies $X(L)=0$:\n$$\nX(L) = A\\sin(k_{x}L) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(k_{x}L) = 0$. This condition quantizes the values of $k_{x}$:\n$$\nk_{x}L = n_{x}\\pi \\quad \\implies \\quad k_{x} = \\frac{n_{x}\\pi}{L}\n$$\nHere, $n_{x}$ must be a positive integer ($n_{x} = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$). If $n_x = 0$, then $k_x = 0$ and $X(x) = 0$, leading to a trivial wavefunction. Negative integers for $n_x$ do not produce new, linearly independent solutions.\n\nIdentical reasoning applies to the $y$ and $z$ dimensions, yielding:\n$$\nk_{y} = \\frac{n_{y}\\pi}{L} \\quad , \\quad k_{z} = \\frac{n_{z}\\pi}{L}\n$$\nwhere $n_{y}$ and $n_{z}$ are also positive integers. Substituting these quantized values of $k_{x}$, $k_{y}$, and $k_{z}$ into the energy expression gives the allowed energy eigenvalues:\n$$\nE_{n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\left(\\left(\\frac{n_{x}\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{n_{y}\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{n_{z}\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^{2}\\hbar^{2}}{2mL^{2}}(n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2})\n$$\nThe problem requires the expression in terms of the Planck constant $h$, where $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$. Substituting this:\n$$\nE_{n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}} = \\frac{\\pi^{2}(h/2\\pi)^{2}}{2mL^{2}}(n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2}) = \\frac{\\pi^{2}h^{2}}{4\\pi^{2} \\cdot 2mL^{2}}(n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2})\n$$\n$$\nE_{n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}} = \\frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}(n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2})\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the allowed stationary-state energies.\n\nNext, we address degeneracy. Degeneracy occurs when distinct quantum states have the same energy. A quantum state for the particle in a box is defined by the set of three quantum numbers $(n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z})$, which specifies a unique wavefunction $\\psi_{n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}}$. The energy $E_{n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}}$ depends only upon the sum of the squares of these integers, $n_{x}^{2} + n_{y}^{2} + n_{z}^{2}$. Because the box is a cube ($L_x=L_y=L_z=L$), the contribution of each quantum number to the energy is weighted equally. Consequently, any permutation of a given triple $(n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z})$ that results in a distinct triple will yield the same energy value. For example, the states $(n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z}) = (1, 2, 3)$ and $(n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z}) = (3, 1, 2)$ are distinct states with different wavefunctions, but they have the same energy because $1^{2} + 2^{2} + 3^{2} = 3^{2} + 1^{2} + 2^{2}$. This is a *systematic degeneracy* arising from the spatial symmetry of the cubic potential.\n\nWe now enumerate the degeneracies for the two specified sets:\n1.  For the set obtained by permutations of $(1, 1, 2)$: The sum of squares is $1^{2} + 1^{2} + 2^{2} = 6$. The distinct triples $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that yield this sum are permutations of $(1,1,2)$. These are:\n    $$\n    (1, 1, 2), \\quad (1, 2, 1), \\quad (2, 1, 1)\n    $$\n    There are $3$ such distinct states. Therefore, the degeneracy $g$ for this energy level is $3$.\n\n2.  For the set obtained by permutations of $(1, 2, 3)$: The sum of squares is $1^{2} + 2^{2} + 3^{2} = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14$. Since all three integers are distinct, all $3!$ permutations will result in a distinct triple of quantum numbers. These are:\n    $$\n    (1, 2, 3), \\quad (1, 3, 2), \\quad (2, 1, 3), \\quad (2, 3, 1), \\quad (3, 1, 2), \\quad (3, 2, 1)\n    $$\n    There are $3! = 6$ such distinct states. Therefore, the degeneracy $g$ for this energy level is $6$.\n\nFinally, we compute the common energy associated with each of these two sets. The energies will be expressed in Joules if the constants $h$, $m$, and $L$ are given in SI units.\n\n1.  Energy for the set $(1, 1, 2)$:\n    $$\n    E_{(1,1,2)} = \\frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}(1^{2} + 1^{2} + 2^{2}) = \\frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}(6) = \\frac{3h^{2}}{4mL^{2}}\n    $$\n2.  Energy for the set $(1, 2, 3)$:\n    $$\n    E_{(1,2,3)} = \\frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}(1^{2} + 2^{2} + 3^{2}) = \\frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}(14) = \\frac{7h^{2}}{4mL^{2}}\n    $$\nThe final answer is required as a two-entry row matrix containing these two energy values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3h^{2}}{4mL^{2}} & \\frac{7h^{2}}{4mL^{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2793169"}, {"introduction": "While symmetry is a common source of degeneracy, it is not the only one.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in quantum mechanics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the time-independent Schrödinger equation in three dimensions for a particle of mass $m$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y,z) + V(x,y,z) \\psi(x,y,z) = E \\psi(x,y,z) $$\nInside the box, where $0 < x < L$, $0 < y < L$, and $0 < z < L$, the potential $V(x,y,z) = 0$.

We postulate a solution of the form $\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. Substituting this into the equation and dividing by $\\psi(x,y,z)$ yields:\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{Y(y)} \\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2} + \\frac{1}{Z(z)} \\frac{d^2Z(z)}{dz^2} \\right) = E $$\nEach term on the left-hand side is a function of a single independent variable. For their sum to be a constant, $E$, each term must individually be a constant. We define these constants as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X(x)} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = -k_x^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{Y(y)} \\frac{d^2Y(y)}{dy^2} = -k_y^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{Z(z)} \\frac{d^2Z(z)}{dz^2} = -k_z^2 $$\nThe total energy $E$ is then related to these separation constants:\n$$ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2) = E $$\nThe solution to the ordinary differential equation for $X(x)$ is of the form $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x) + B \\cos(k_x x)$. The infinite potential walls impose boundary conditions. The wavefunction must be zero at the boundaries. At $x=0$, $\\psi(0,y,z)=0$, which implies $X(0)=0$. This requires $B=0$. The solution simplifies to $X(x) = A \\sin(k_x x)$. At $x=L$, $\\psi(L,y,z)=0$, implying $X(L)=0$. This leads to the condition $A \\sin(k_x L) = 0$. Since $A=0$ would give a trivial solution, we must have $\\sin(k_x L) = 0$. This quantizes the allowed values of $k_x$:\n$$ k_x L = n_x \\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n_x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\} $$\nThe quantum number $n_x$ must be a positive integer, as $n_x=0$ results in a trivial wavefunction, and negative integers merely change the sign of the wavefunction, which is physically equivalent.\nThus, $k_x = \\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}$. By symmetry, the same logic applies to the $y$ and $z$ dimensions, giving $k_y = \\frac{n_y \\pi}{L}$ and $k_z = \\frac{n_z \\pi}{L}$, where $n_y$ and $n_z$ are also positive integers.\n\nSubstituting these quantized wave numbers back into the expression for the energy $E$, we obtain the stationary-state energy spectrum:\n$$ E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\left(\\frac{n_x \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_y \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{n_z \\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\right) $$\n$$ E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we analyze the energy manifold specified by the condition $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 27$. The energy of this level is $E = \\frac{27 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Degeneracy arises when multiple distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ yield the same value for the sum of squares.\n\nThe problem requires demonstrating accidental degeneracy by checking two proposed sets of quantum numbers.\nFor the triplet $(3,3,3)$:\n$$ n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 $$\nThis triplet satisfies the condition.\nFor the triplet $(1,1,5)$:\n$$ n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 $$\nThis triplet also satisfies the condition, as do all its distinct permutations. The existence of two different sets of numbers, $\\{1,1,5\\}$ and $\\{3,3,3\\}$, which produce the same energy is known as accidental degeneracy. This is distinct from symmetric degeneracy, which arises from permuting unequal quantum numbers (e.g., $(1,2,3)$ and $(2,1,3)$ in a cube).\n\nFinally, we compute the total spatial degeneracy of this energy level. This corresponds to the total number of unique ordered triplets of positive integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy the condition $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 27$. We must find all such integer solutions.\nWe search for sums of three squares of positive integers that equal $27$. The possible squares are $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $4^2=16$, $5^2=25$. Any number larger than $5$ would have a square greater than $27$.\n\nCase 1: The quantum numbers are from the set $\\{3,3,3\\}$.\nThe only possible ordered triplet is $(3,3,3)$. This corresponds to one distinct quantum state. The number of states for this case is $1$.\n\nCase 2: The quantum numbers are from the set $\\{1,1,5\\}$.\nThe ordered triplets are the distinct permutations of $(1,1,5)$. These are:\n$(1,1,5)$, $(1,5,1)$, and $(5,1,1)$.\nThe number of distinct permutations of these three numbers, with one number repeated twice, is given by $\\frac{3!}{2!1!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. These three permutations correspond to three distinct quantum states.\n\nWe must verify that there are no other sets of positive integers whose squares sum to $27$. A systematic search shows that $\\{1,1,25\\}$ and $\\{9,9,9\\}$ are the only partitions of $27$ into three squares of positive integers. Therefore, the quantum number sets $\\{1,1,5\\}$ and $\\{3,3,3\\}$ are exhaustive.\n\nThe total spatial degeneracy of the energy level is the sum of the number of distinct states from all possible cases.\nTotal Degeneracy = (Number of states from Case 1) + (Number of states from Case 2)\nTotal Degeneracy = $1 + 3 = 4$.\nThe energy level corresponding to $n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2=27$ is therefore $4$-fold degenerate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "2914150"}, {"introduction": "Degenerate energy levels are foundational but often represent an idealized situation.
