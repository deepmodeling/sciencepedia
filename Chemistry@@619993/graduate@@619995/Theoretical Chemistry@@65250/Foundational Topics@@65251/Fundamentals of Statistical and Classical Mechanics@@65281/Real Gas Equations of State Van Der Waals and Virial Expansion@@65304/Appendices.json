The second virial coefficient $B_{2}(T)$ accounts for the leading-order correction to ideal-gas behavior due to pairwise interactions between particles. From the cluster expansion formalism in the canonical ensemble, $B_{2}(T)$ is given by an integral over the Mayer $f$-function, which is defined as $f(r) = \\exp(-\\beta u(r)) - 1$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$ and $u(r)$ is the pair potential.\n\nThe general expression for the second virial coefficient is:\n$$ B_{2}(T) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int f(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d^{3}r $$\nHere, the integral is over the relative position vector $\\mathbf{r}$ of a pair of particles. For a spherically symmetric potential $u(r)$, where $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$, the Mayer function $f$ also depends only on the magnitude $r$.\n\nThe problem specifies a hard-sphere potential, given by:\n$$ u(r) = \\begin{cases} +\\infty & \\text{for } r < \\sigma \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } r \\ge \\sigma \\end{cases} $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the diameter of the hard spheres. We must first determine the form of the Mayer function $f(r)$ for this potential.\n\nFor $r < \\sigma$, the potential $u(r) = +\\infty$. The argument of the exponential is $-\\beta u(r) = -\\infty$.

As predicted, it is a constant, independent of temperature.\n\nFor the interpretation, we analyze the physical meaning of this result. The positive sign of $B_{2}$ indicates that the net effect of the interaction is repulsive, leading to a pressure that is higher than that of an ideal gas at the same density and temperature. This is expected for hard spheres, which only experience repulsion. The quantity $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$ represents the volume of a sphere of radius $\\sigma$. This is the \"excluded volume\" for the center of one hard sphere due to the presence of another. The center of any sphere is excluded from a sphere of radius $\\sigma$ centered on any other sphere.\nThe coefficient $B_{2}$ is equal to one-half of this excluded volume for a pair of particles:\n$$ B_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\text{Volume of sphere of radius } \\sigma \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}\\right) $$\nThe factor of $1/2$ arises from the definition of $B_{2}$, which is concerned with pairwise interactions and avoids double-counting.\nIt is also instructive to relate $B_{2}$ to the volume of a single particle, $v_{\\text{particle}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\sigma/2)^{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3}$.\n$$ B_{2} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3} = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3} \\right) = 4 v_{\\text{particle}} $$\nThus, the second virial coefficient for hard spheres is four times the volume of a single particle.\n\nFinally, we connect this result to the van der Waals equation of state, which on a per-mole basis is $\\left(P + a/V_{m}^{2}\\right)(V_{m}-b) = RT$. By expanding this equation in powers of the inverse molar volume $1/V_{m}$ (equivalent to density), one finds the second virial coefficient for a van der Waals gas to be $B_{2}^{\\text{vdW}}(T) = b - a/(RT)$. The parameter $a$ accounts for attractive forces, and the parameter $b$ accounts for the finite size of the particles, the \"co-volume\". The hard-sphere model has no attractive forces, which corresponds to setting $a=0$. Thus, for a gas of hard spheres treated with the van der Waals equation, we would have $B_{2} = b$.\nBy comparing our first-principles result with the van der Waals model, we identify the molar co-volume parameter $b$ as:\n$$ b = N_{A} B_{2} = N_{A} \\left( \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3} \\right) = 4 \\left( N_{A} \\frac{1}{6}\\pi\\sigma^{3} \\right) $$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is the Avogadro constant. This shows that the van der Waals parameter $b$ corresponds to four times the total physical volume of the particles in one mole, a classic result of statistical mechanics that is rigorously confirmed by this derivation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\sigma^{3}} $$", "id": "2800866"}, {"introduction": "Having established the effect of pure repulsion, we now introduce attractive forces, a key feature of real intermolecular interactions.

A direct numerical approach requires truncating this to $[0, X_{max}]$. Simple truncation leads to significant error because the integrand decays slowly (as $x^{-4}$).\n    -   A superior strategy is to split the integral at a finite cutoff $X_{max}$:\n        $$\n        \\int_0^\\infty I(x; T^*) dx = \\int_0^{X_{max}} I(x; T^*) dx + \\int_{X_{max}}^\\infty I(x; T^*) dx\n        $$\n    -   The first part, from $0$ to $X_{max}$, is evaluated using a high-quality adaptive quadrature algorithm, such as the one implemented in `scipy.integrate.quad`.\n    -   The second part, the \"tail,\" is evaluated analytically by using the asymptotic expansion of the integrand for large $x$.\n        Let $z(x) = \\frac{4}{T^*}(x^{-6} - x^{-12})$. For large $x$, $z(x)$ is small.\n        $$\n        e^{z(x)} - 1 = z(x) + \\frac{z(x)^2}{2} + O(z(x)^3)\n        $$\n        $z(x)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)^2(x^{-6} - x^{-12})^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)^2(x^{-12} - 2x^{-18} + x^{-24})$.\n        Keeping terms that will result in $x^{-10}$ or larger powers after multiplication by $x^2$:\n        $$\n        I(x; T^*) \\approx x^2 \\left[ \\frac{4}{T^*}(x^{-6} - x^{-12}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)^2 x^{-12} \\right] = \\frac{4}{T^*}x^{-4} + \\left(\\frac{8}{(T^*)^2} - \\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)x^{-10}\n        $$\n        The analytical integral for the tail is:\n        $$\n        \\int_{X_{max}}^\\infty I(x; T^*) dx \\approx \\int_{X_{max}}^\\infty \\left[ \\frac{4}{T^*}x^{-4} + \\left(\\frac{8}{(T^*)^2} - \\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)x^{-10} \\right] dx\n        $$\n        $$\n        = \\left[ \\frac{4}{T^*} \\frac{x^{-3}}{-3} + \\left(\\frac{8}{(T^*)^2} - \\frac{4}{T^*}\\right) \\frac{x^{-9}}{-9} \\right]_{X_{max}}^\\infty = \\frac{4}{3T^*}X_{max}^{-3} + \\frac{1}{9}\\left(\\frac{8}{(T^*)^2} - \\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)X_{max}^{-9}\n        $$\n        This asymptotic tail correction dramatically improves accuracy, allowing for a modest value of $X_{max}$. A choice of $X_{max} = 20.0$ is sufficient to ensure the neglected higher-order terms (decaying as $x^{-16}$) are well below the target precision of $10^{-8}$.\n\n3.  **Concrete Algorithm:**\n    For each given reduced temperature $T^*$:\n    a.  Define the integrand function $I(x;T^*) = x^2 \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{T^*}(x^{-12} - x^{-6})\\right) - 1 \\right]$. It is numerically advantageous to use a library function like `numpy.expm1(y)` which accurately computes $e^y-1$.\n    b.  Set the integration cutoff $X_{max} = 20.0$.\n    c.  Compute the numerical part of the integral, $J_{num} = \\int_0^{X_{max}} I(x; T^*) dx$, using a reliable quadrature routine (`scipy.integrate.quad`).\n    d.  Compute the analytical tail correction, $J_{tail} = \\frac{4}{3T^*}X_{max}^{-3} + \\frac{1}{9}\\left(\\frac{8}{(T^*)^2} - \\frac{4}{T^*}\\right)X_{max}^{-9}$.\n    e.  The total integral is $J_{total} = J_{num} + J_{tail}$.\n    f.  The reduced second virial coefficient is $B_2^*(T^*) = -2\\pi J_{total}$.\n    g.  Round the final result to $8$ decimal places as required.\n\nThis algorithm is robust, systematically accurate, and directly implementable using standard scientific computing libraries.\n\n**Part 3: Implementation**\n\n```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the reduced second virial coefficient B2*(T*) for the \n    Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential for a given set of reduced temperatures T*.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        0.5,      # strong attractive effects\n        1.0,      # moderate temperature\n        2.0,      # warmer gas\n        3.417,    # near the Boyle temperature\n        10.0,     # high temperature\n        100.0     # asymptotically high temperature\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Set the cutoff for the numerical part of the integration.\n    # A value of 20.0 is sufficient for the required precision when using\n    # the analytical tail correction.\n    X_max = 20.0\n\n    for T_star in test_cases:\n        # Define the integrand for B2*.
