The distribution of particle momenta and thus $\\Omega_{\\text{mom}}$ depends on the system's temperature $T$. Since the temperature is constant at $T$ both before and after the mixing process, the momentum contribution to the entropy change is zero: $\\Delta S_{\\text{mom}} = S_{\\text{mom,after}} - S_{\\text{mom,before}} = 0$. We are thus justified in considering only the configurational entropy change, $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = \\Delta S_{\\text{config}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the configurational statistical weight for $N$ particles in a volume $V$ is proportional to $V^N$. For distinguishable particles, this is $\\Omega_{\\text{config}} = C V^N$, where $C$ is a proportionality constant. For $N$ indistinguishable particles, we must correct for overcounting by dividing by the number of permutations of the particles, $N!$. So, $\\Omega_{\\text{config}} = C \\frac{V^N}{N!}$. We can absorb the constant $C$ into a term $\\phi$ that depends on temperature but is independent of volume and particle number, giving $\\Omega_{\\text{config}} = \\frac{(\\phi V)^N}{N!}$.
