The system is isolated.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state of the system. The two gases are in separate compartments of volumes $V_A$ and $V_B$. Gas A has $N_A$ particles, energy $E_A$, and is confined to volume $V_A$. Gas B has $N_B$ particles, energy $E_B$, and is confined to volume $V_B$.

The partition is removed, and the gases mix in the total volume $V = V_A + V_B$. The total energy $E = E_A + E_B$ is conserved as the process is adiabatic for the isolated total system. Since the gases are ideal and nonreacting, they do not interact with each other. Therefore, even after mixing, they can be treated as two independent systems coexisting in the same volume $V$. The total number of microstates of the final system is the product of the microstates available to each gas in the total volume $V$, with a partition of the total energy $E$ into $E'_A$ and $E'_B$ such that $E'_A + E'_B = E$.\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{after}} = \\Omega_A(E'_A, V, N_A) \\Omega_B(E'_B, V, N_B)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that initially, the two gases are at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.

Thus, the canonical partition function is the Laplace transform of the microcanonical density of states.\n\nWe now evaluate this integral using the expression for $g(E)$ derived in Part 1.\n$$ Z(\\beta) = \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\hbar^2} \\right) \\exp(-\\beta E) dE $$\nSince $\\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\hbar^2}$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$ Z(\\beta) = \\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\hbar^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\beta E) dE = \\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\hbar^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E)}{-\\beta} \\right]_0^\\infty $$\n$$ Z(\\beta) = \\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\hbar^2} \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{-\\beta} \\right) = \\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\beta\\hbar^2} $$\nThis is the well-known high-temperature (small $\\beta$) expression for the rotational partition function of a linear molecule.\n\nTo confirm this result, we can also evaluate the partition function by approximating the original sum in the high-temperature limit.\n$$ Z(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\sum_{J=0}^{\\infty} (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)\\right) $$\nFor high temperature (small $\\beta$), the sum can be approximated by an integral over a continuous variable $J$:\n$$ Z(\\beta) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\int_0^\\infty (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)\\right) dJ $$\nLet $u = J(J+1)$. Then $du = (2J+1)dJ$. As $J$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$, $u$ also goes from $0$ to $\\infty$. The integral becomes:\n$$ Z(\\beta) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} u \\right) du = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{1}{\\beta \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}} = \\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\beta\\hbar^2} $$\nThe result derived from the Laplace transform of $g(E)$ matches the direct high-temperature evaluation of the partition function sum.\n\nThis agreement demonstrates the consistency between the microcanonical and canonical ensemble descriptions in the thermodynamic limit (for this system, the limit of large energy or high temperature). In this limit, where a large number of states are accessible, the macroscopic properties of the system become independent of the specific statistical ensemble used for calculation. The Laplace transform provides the formal mathematical connection between the fixed-energy-shell perspective of the microcanonical ensemble and the temperature-fixed, averaged-energy perspective of the canonical ensemble.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2I}{\\sigma\\hbar^2}} $$", "id": "2816859"}]}
