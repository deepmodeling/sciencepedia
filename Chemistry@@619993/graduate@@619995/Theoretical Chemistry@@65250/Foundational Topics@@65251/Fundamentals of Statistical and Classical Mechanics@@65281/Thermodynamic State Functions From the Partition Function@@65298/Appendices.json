A macroscopic system at fixed particle number $N$ and volume $V$.\n2. The system is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at absolute temperature $T$.\n3. The system's energy $E$ is a non-negative continuum, $E \\ge 0$.\n4. The density of states is $g(E) = \\frac{E^{a}}{\\Gamma(a+1)\\,\\epsilon_{0}^{\\,a+1}}$, where $a > -1$ is a real parameter, $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the gamma function, and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is a fixed energy scale.\n5. The inverse temperature is defined as $\\beta \\equiv 1/(k_{B} T)$, with $k_{B}$ being the Boltzmann constant.\nThe task is to derive the canonical partition function $Z(\\beta)$, internal energy $U(T)$, entropy $S(T)$, and constant-volume heat capacity $C_{V}$, and to state the conditions for convergence and stability.\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics. It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with all variables and functions properly defined. The form of $g(E)$ is a standard model, and the provided constraint $a > -1$ is physically and mathematically necessary, ensuring the problem leads to a meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe canonical partition function, $Z$, for a system with a continuous energy spectrum is defined by the integral of the Boltzmann factor over all states, weighted by the density of states $g(E)$:\n$$\nZ(\\beta) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(E) \\exp(-\\beta E) \\, dE\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $g(E)$:\n$$\nZ(\\beta) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{E^{a}}{\\Gamma(a+1)\\,\\epsilon_{0}^{\\,a+1}} \\exp(-\\beta E) \\, dE\n$$\nThe terms that do not depend on the integration variable $E$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nZ(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(a+1)\\,\\epsilon_{0}^{\\,a+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E^{a} \\exp(-\\beta E) \\, dE\n$$\nThis integral is related to the definition of the gamma function, $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{z-1} \\exp(-x) \\, dx$. To transform our integral into this form, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = \\beta E$, which implies $E = x/\\beta$ and $dE = dx/\\beta$. The limits of integration remain from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} E^{a} \\exp(-\\beta E) \\, dE = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{x}{\\beta}\\right)^{a} \\exp(-x) \\frac{dx}{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{\\beta^{a+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{a} \\exp(-x) \\, dx\n$$\nThe remaining integral is $\\Gamma(a+1)$. Substituting this back into the expression for $Z(\\beta)$:\n$$\nZ(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(a+1)\\,\\epsilon_{0}^{\\,a+1}} \\frac{\\Gamma(a+1)}{\\beta^{a+1}} = \\frac{1}{(\\beta \\epsilon_{0})^{a+1}} = (\\beta \\epsilon_{0})^{-(a+1)}\n$$\nThis integral, and thus the partition function $Z(\\beta)$, converges only if $a+1 > 0$, which is $a > -1$. This condition is given in the problem statement. It is also required that $\\beta > 0$, which is true for any physical system at a positive absolute temperature $T > 0$.\n\nThe average internal energy $U$ is derived from the partition function using the standard identity:\n$$\nU = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\nFirst, we find $\\ln Z$:\n$$\n\\ln Z(\\beta) = \\ln\\left((\\beta \\epsilon_{0})^{-(a+1)}\\right) = -(a+1) \\ln(\\beta \\epsilon_{0}) = -(a+1)(\\ln \\beta + \\ln \\epsilon_{0})\n$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta} = -(a+1) \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n$$\nTherefore, the internal energy is:\n$$\nU = -\\left(-(a+1) \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right) = \\frac{a+1}{\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$, we express $U$ as a function of temperature:\n$$\nU(T) = (a+1)k_{B}T\n$$\nThe constant-volume heat capacity $C_{V}$ is the rate of change of internal energy with respect to temperature at constant volume:\n$$\nC_{V} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V}\n$$\nDifferentiating our expression for $U(T)$:\n$$\nC_{V} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left((a+1)k_{B}T\\right) = (a+1)k_{B}\n$$\nFor the system to be thermodynamically stable, an addition of heat must result in an increase in temperature, which implies that the heat capacity must be non-negative: $C_{V} \\ge 0$. As $k_{B}$ is a positive constant, this requires $a+1 \\ge 0$, or $a \\ge -1$. Combining with the convergence criterion for $Z$, the condition for a stable system with a well-defined statistical description is $a > -1$.\n\nThe entropy $S$ is related to $U$ and $Z$ through the fundamental thermodynamic relation $S = \\frac{U}{T} + k_{B}\\ln Z$. Substituting our derived expressions for $U$ and $\\ln Z$:\n$$\nS(T) = \\frac{(a+1)k_{B}T}{T} + k_{B} \\left( -(a+1)\\ln(\\beta \\epsilon_{0}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nS(T) = (a+1)k_{B} - (a+1)k_{B}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{0}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = (a+1)k_{B}\\left(1 - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{0}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$$\nS(T) = (a+1)k_{B}\\left(1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B}T}{\\epsilon_{0}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we check for consistency with the second law of thermodynamics. A key consequence of the second law is that for a stable system at constant volume, entropy must be a monotonically increasing function of temperature. We test this by computing the derivative of $S(T)$ with respect to $T$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left[ (a+1)k_{B}\\left(1 + \\ln(k_{B}T) - \\ln(\\epsilon_{0})\\right) \\right] = (a+1)k_{B} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} \\cdot k_{B}\\right) = \\frac{(a+1)k_{B}}{T}\n$$\nUsing the thermodynamic identity $C_{V} = T(\\partial S/\\partial T)_{V}$, we find $C_V = T \\frac{(a+1)k_{B}}{T} = (a+1)k_B$, which is consistent with our direct calculation of $C_V$. For $T > 0$, the condition $(\\partial S/\\partial T)_{V} > 0$ requires $(a+1)k_{B} > 0$, which simplifies to $a > -1$. This demonstrates that the condition for thermodynamic stability ($C_V>0$) and for entropy to be a well-behaved increasing function of temperature is identical to the condition for the convergence of the partition function. This self-consistency is a hallmark of the logical structure of statistical mechanics and its agreement with thermodynamics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(\\beta \\epsilon_0)^{-(a+1)} & (a+1)k_B T & (a+1)k_B \\left[ 1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B T}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) \\right] & (a+1)k_B\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2680176"}, {"introduction": "Building on the general method, this exercise applies it to one of the most important model systems in physics and chemistry: the classical ideal gas.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the four specified tasks.\n\n1. Evaluation of the Canonical Partition Function $Z_{N}(V,T)$\n\nThe Hamiltonian $H(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{2}}{2m}$ depends only on the momenta $\\mathbf{p}$, not on the positions $\\mathbf{q}$. The phase-space integral can be separated into position and momentum integrals.\n$$Z_{N}(V,T) = \\frac{1}{N!\\,h^{3N}} \\left( \\int d^{3N}\\!q \\right) \\left( \\int \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{2}}{2m}\\right) d^{3N}\\!p \\right)$$\nThe integral over coordinates is taken over the volume $V$. Since the $N$ particles are noninteracting, this is the product of $N$ single-particle integrals:\n$$\\int d^{3N}\\!q = \\left( \\int_{V} d^3q_i \\right)^N = V^N$$\nThe momentum integral is also separable into a product of $N$ identical single-particle integrals:\n$$\\int \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{i}^{2}}{2m}\\right) d^{3N}\\!p = \\left( \\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) d^3p \\right)^N$$\nThe single-particle integral is a product of three one-dimensional Gaussian integrals:\n$$\\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^2}{2m}\\right) d^3p = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_x^2}{2m}\\right) dp_x \\right)^3$$\nUsing the standard result for a Gaussian integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2) dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, with $a = \\beta/(2m)$:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_x^2}{2m}\\right) dp_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m\\pi}{\\beta}}$$\nThus, the three-dimensional momentum integral for one particle is:\n$$\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2m\\pi}{\\beta}} \\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{2m\\pi}{\\beta}\\right)^{3/2} = (2\\pi m k_B T)^{3/2}$$\nCombining these results, the partition function becomes:\n$$Z_{N}(V,T) = \\frac{1}{N!\\,h^{3N}} V^N \\left( (2\\pi m k_B T)^{3/2} \\right)^N = \\frac{1}{N!} \\left[ \\frac{V}{h^3} (2\\pi m k_B T)^{3/2} \\right]^N$$\nThe problem requires introducing the thermal de Broglie wavelength, which is defined as $\\Lambda(T) = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$.

Derivation of Entropy $S(N,V,T)$\n\nThe entropy $S$ is related to the Helmholtz free energy $F$ by $S = -(\\partial F/\\partial T)_{N,V}$. Since $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$, this gives $S = k_B \\ln Z + k_B T (\\partial \\ln Z / \\partial T)_{N,V}$.\nFirst, we find the temperature derivative of $\\ln Z$.\n$$\\ln Z_{N}(V,T) = \\ln\\left[ \\frac{1}{N!} \\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right)^N \\right] = N\\ln V - N\\ln(\\Lambda^3) - \\ln(N!)$$\nThe temperature dependence resides entirely in the $\\Lambda(T)$ term.\n$$\\ln(\\Lambda^3) = 3\\ln\\Lambda = 3\\ln\\left( \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}} \\right) = 3\\ln(h) - \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(2\\pi m k_B) - \\frac{3}{2}\\ln T$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $T$ is:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_{N}(V,T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{N,V} = -N \\frac{\\partial(\\ln(\\Lambda^3))}{\\partial T} = -N \\left( -\\frac{3}{2T} \\right) = \\frac{3N}{2T}$$\nNow, we substitute this into the expression for entropy:\n$$S(N,V,T) = k_B \\ln Z_{N}(V,T) + k_B T\\left( \\frac{3N}{2T} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}N k_B + k_B \\ln Z_{N}(V,T)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\ln Z_N(V,T)$:\n$$S(N,V,T) = k_B \\left( N\\ln\\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - \\ln(N!) \\right) + \\frac{3}{2}N k_B$$\nThis expression is exact within the classical framework and does not yet use Stirling's approximation.\n\n3. Calculation of the Entropy Change $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$\n\nThe initial state consists of two identical, separate subsystems of size $(N,V,T)$. Since entropy is additive for independent subsystems, the total initial entropy is:\n$$S_{\\text{initial}} = S(N,V,T) + S(N,V,T) = 2 S(N,V,T)$$\n$$S_{\\text{initial}} = 2 \\left[ k_B \\left( N\\ln\\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - \\ln(N!) \\right) + \\frac{3}{2}N k_B \\right] = 2 N k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - 2 k_B \\ln(N!) + 3 N k_B$$\nThe final state is a single system of $(2N, 2V, T)$. Its entropy is $S_{\\text{final}} = S(2N,2V,T)$. We use the general formula for $S$ with $N \\to 2N$ and $V \\to 2V$:\n$$S_{\\text{final}} = k_B \\left( (2N)\\ln\\left(\\frac{2V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - \\ln((2N)!) \\right) + \\frac{3}{2}(2N) k_B$$\n$$S_{\\text{final}} = 2 N k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{2V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - k_B \\ln((2N)!) + 3 N k_B$$\nThe change in entropy is $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = S_{\\text{final}} - S_{\\text{initial}}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = \\left[ 2 N k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{2V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - k_B \\ln((2N)!) + 3 N k_B \\right] - \\left[ 2 N k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - 2 k_B \\ln(N!) + 3 N k_B \\right]$$\nThe term $3N k_B$ cancels. We can group the logarithmic terms:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = 2 N k_B \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{2V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\right) \\right] - k_B \\left[ \\ln((2N)!) - 2\\ln(N!) \\right]$$\nThe first term simplifies using $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$2 N k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{2V/\\Lambda^3}{V/\\Lambda^3}\\right) = 2 N k_B \\ln(2)$$\nThe second term can be written using the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2N}{N} = \\frac{(2N)!}{N!N!}$:\n$$-k_B \\left[ \\ln((2N)!) - \\ln((N!)^2) \\right] = -k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{(2N)!}{(N!)^2}\\right) = -k_B \\ln\\binom{2N}{N}$$\nSo, the exact expression for the entropy change is:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} = 2 N k_B \\ln(2) - k_B \\ln\\binom{2N}{N}$$\n\n4. Simplification using Stirling's Approximation\n\nThe problem requires simplification in the thermodynamic limit using Stirling's approximation to leading extensive order, which is $\\ln(M!) \\approx M\\ln M - M$. We apply this to the $\\ln\\binom{2N}{N}$ term.\n$$\\ln\\binom{2N}{N} = \\ln((2N)!) - 2\\ln(N!)$$\nApplying the approximation:\n$$\\ln((2N)!) \\approx (2N)\\ln(2N) - (2N) = 2N(\\ln 2 + \\ln N) - 2N = 2N\\ln 2 + 2N\\ln N - 2N$$\n$$2\\ln(N!) \\approx 2(N\\ln N - N) = 2N\\ln N - 2N$$\nSubtracting the two results:\n$$\\ln\\binom{2N}{N} \\approx (2N\\ln 2 + 2N\\ln N - 2N) - (2N\\ln N - 2N) = 2N\\ln 2$$\nThe terms that do not scale linearly with $N$ have been neglected, as required. Now, we substitute this approximation back into the expression for $\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}}$:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\text{mix}} \\approx 2 N k_B \\ln(2) - k_B (2N\\ln 2) = 2 N k_B \\ln(2) - 2 N k_B \\ln(2) = 0$$\nThe result that the entropy change is zero is physically correct. When the partition between two identical gases at the same temperature and density is removed, the final state is macroscopically indistinguishable from the sum of the initial states. The entropy, being an extensive state function, is $S(2N, 2V, T) = 2 S(N, V, T)$. This result hinges on the correct treatment of particles as indistinguishable via the $1/N!$ factor from the outset, which resolves the Gibbs paradox.

For a classical quadratic degree of freedom, the equipartition theorem emerges from the classical partition function and implies an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2}k_{B} T$ per quadratic term. A linear rotor has two rotational quadratic degrees of freedom, hence\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{rot}}(T) = k_{B} T, \\quad U_{\\mathrm{rot, mol}}(T) = R T, \\quad C_{V,\\mathrm{rot}}(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{rot, mol}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} = R.\n$$\nThus, under the stated high-temperature condition, the rotational contribution is temperature-independent and equal to $R$ per mole.\n\nVibrational part (independent quantum harmonic oscillators):\nFor a single harmonic mode with angular frequency $\\omega_{i} = 2\\pi \\nu_{i}$ and frequency $\\nu_{i} = c \\tilde{\\nu}_{i}$, the quantum energy levels are $\\varepsilon_{n,i} = h \\nu_{i}\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ for $n = 0,1,2,\\dots$. The single-mode partition function is\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{vib},i}(T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\!\\left[-\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right]\n= \\frac{\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\right)}.\n$$\nIf the mode has degeneracy $g_{i}$, then its contribution is $q_{\\mathrm{vib},i}^{\\,g_{i}}(T)$, and the total vibrational partition function is\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\prod_{i=1}^{s} \\left[q_{\\mathrm{vib},i}(T)\\right]^{g_{i}}.\n$$\nThe vibrational contribution to the per-molecule internal energy is\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T)\n= -\\sum_{i=1}^{s} g_{i}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\left[\\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib},i}(T)\\right].\n$$\nWith $\\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib},i}(T) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta h \\nu_{i} - \\ln\\!\\left(1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\right)\\right)$, differentiation gives\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\ln q_{\\mathrm{vib},i}(T)\n= \\frac{1}{2} h \\nu_{i} + \\frac{h \\nu_{i}}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\right) - 1}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^{s} g_{i}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} h \\nu_{i} + \\frac{h \\nu_{i}}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\right) - 1}\\right].\n$$\nThe zero-point energy term $\\sum_{i} g_{i}\\,\\frac{1}{2} h \\nu_{i}$ is independent of $T$ and does not contribute to the heat capacity. The temperature-dependent part is\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\ast}(T) = \\sum_{i=1}^{s} g_{i}\\,\\frac{h \\nu_{i}}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\beta h \\nu_{i}\\right) - 1}.\n$$\nThe molar vibrational internal energy is $U_{\\mathrm{vib, mol}}^{\\ast}(T) = N_{A}\\,u_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{\\ast}(T)$. Using $\\theta_{i} = \\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}_{i}}{k_{B}} = \\frac{h \\nu_{i}}{k_{B}}$, so that $h \\nu_{i} = k_{B} \\theta_{i}$ and $\\beta h \\nu_{i} = \\frac{\\theta_{i}}{T}$, we obtain\n$$\nU_{\\mathrm{vib, mol}}^{\\ast}(T) = R \\sum_{i=1}^{s} g_{i}\\,\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{T}\\right) - 1}.\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $T$ at constant $V$ gives the molar vibrational heat capacity:\n$$\nC_{V,\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{vib, mol}}^{\\ast}}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V}\n= R \\sum_{i=1}^{s} g_{i}\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left[\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{T}\\right) - 1}\\right].\n$$\nLet $x_{i} = \\frac{\\theta_{i}}{T}$, so that $\\frac{d x_{i}}{d T} = -\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{T^{2}} = -\\frac{x_{i}}{T}$.
