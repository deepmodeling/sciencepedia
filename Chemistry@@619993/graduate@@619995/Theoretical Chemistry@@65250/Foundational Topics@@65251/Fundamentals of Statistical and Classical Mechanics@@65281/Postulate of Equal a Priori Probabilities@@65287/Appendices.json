It is a standard problem in classical statistical mechanics concerning the calculation of the density of states for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. All given parameters are clearly defined.

It presents a standard exercise in classical statistical mechanics, providing all necessary physical and mathematical definitions to carry out the derivation. The problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we analyze a single classical spherical-top rigid rotor. Second, we extend this analysis to a system of $N$ such rotors.\n\nPart 1: Single Rotor System\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a single spherical rotor is given as $H = \\frac{L^2}{2I}$, where $L$ is the angular momentum vector and $I$ is the moment of inertia. This Hamiltonian describes a system with three rotational degrees of freedom. The corresponding phase space is $6$-dimensional. The volume element in phase space for these three degrees of freedom is $d\\Gamma_1 = d\\mathbf{q} \\, d\\mathbf{p}$. The generalized coordinates $\\mathbf{q}$ describe the orientation of the rotor, and the generalized momenta $\\mathbf{p}$ are their conjugate momenta.\n\nThe cumulative phase-space volume, $\\Omega_1(E)$, is defined as the number of microstates with energy not exceeding $E$. It is computed by integrating the uniform measure over the region of phase space where $H \\leq E$, and normalizing by the volume of a single quantum cell, $h^3$, and the rotational symmetry number, $\\sigma$.\n$$\n\\Omega_1(E) = \\frac{1}{h^3 \\sigma} \\int_{H \\leq E} d\\mathbf{q} \\, d\\mathbf{p}\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian $H = \\frac{L^2}{2I}$ is independent of the rotor's orientation. Therefore, the integral over the generalized coordinates can be performed separately. The configuration space for a rigid rotor is the space of three-dimensional rotations, $SO(3)$, parameterized, for example, by Euler angles $(\\phi, \\theta, \\psi)$. The volume of this configuration space is:\n$$\n\\int d\\mathbf{q} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\psi = (2\\pi) \\cdot (2) \\cdot (2\\pi) = 8\\pi^2\n$$\nThe momentum part of the integral is taken over the space of canonical momenta. The form of the Hamiltonian $H = \\frac{L^2}{2I} = \\frac{L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2}{2I}$ suggests that the integration is most conveniently performed in the space of angular momentum components $(L_x, L_y, L_z)$. The volume element in this space is $dL_x dL_y dL_z$. The condition $H \\leq E$ translates to $L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2 \\leq 2IE$. This inequality defines a sphere of radius $R_L = \\sqrt{2IE}$ in the $3$-dimensional angular momentum space.

The total Hamiltonian is the sum of the individual Hamiltonians: $H_N = \\sum_{i=1}^N H_i = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{L_i^2}{2I}$. The total phase space is $6N$-dimensional.\n\nThe cumulative phase-space volume $\\Omega_N(E)$ for the $N$-rotor system is given by the integral over the region $H_N \\leq E$. We must include the factor of $1/N!$ for indistinguishable particles and the normalization factor $(h^3\\sigma)^{-N}$ for the $N$ rotors.\n$$\n\\Omega_N(E) = \\frac{1}{N!(h^3\\sigma)^N} \\int_{H_N \\leq E} \\prod_{i=1}^N d\\mathbf{q}_i \\, d\\mathbf{p}_i\n$$\nAs before, the Hamiltonian does not depend on the coordinates. The integral over the $3N$-dimensional configuration space yields $(8\\pi^2)^N$. The momentum integral is over the domain defined by $\\sum_{i=1}^N L_i^2 \\leq 2IE$. This is the sum of squares of $3N$ components of angular momentum, $(L_{1x}, L_{1y}, L_{1z}, \\dots, L_{Nx}, L_{Ny}, L_{Nz})$.

We compute this derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( k_B \\ln C(N) + \\frac{3N k_B}{2} \\ln E \\right)\n$$\nThe term $k_B \\ln C(N)$ is a constant with respect to $E$, so its derivative is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{3N k_B}{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}(\\ln E) = \\frac{3N k_B}{2E}\n$$\nSolving for temperature $T$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\nT(E,N) = \\frac{2E}{3Nk_B}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the equipartition theorem for a classical system with $3N$ quadratic degrees of freedom in its Hamiltonian.
