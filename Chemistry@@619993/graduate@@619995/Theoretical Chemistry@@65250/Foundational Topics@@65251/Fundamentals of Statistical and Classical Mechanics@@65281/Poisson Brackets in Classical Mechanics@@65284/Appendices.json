No numerical approximation is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical Hamiltonian mechanics, containing no contradictions or ambiguities. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of expressions for the radial momentum, $p_r$, and the $z$-component of angular momentum, $L_z$, in terms of Cartesian coordinates and momenta $(x, y, p_x, p_y)$. It then requires the evaluation of the Poisson brackets $\\{r, p_r\\}$ and $\\{r, L_z\\}$ using the provided Cartesian definition.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions of the canonical momenta $(p_r, p_\\phi)$ in plane polar coordinates $(r, \\phi)$. The Lagrangian $L$ is given by $L = T - V$, where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is the potential energy. In Cartesian coordinates, $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)$.

The radial coordinate is $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

Substituting these into the expression for $\\dot{r}$:\n$$\np_r = m \\dot{r} = m \\left( \\frac{x(p_x/m) + y(p_y/m)}{r} \\right) = \\frac{x p_x + y p_y}{r} = \\frac{x p_x + y p_y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for $p_r$.\n\nFor the angular momentum, the definition is $\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$. In a $2$D plane $(x,y)$, this vector has only a $z$-component:\n$$\nL_z = (\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p})_z = x p_y - y p_x\n$$\nThis is consistent with our Lagrangian derivation, as one can show that $mr^2\\dot{\\phi} = x p_y - y p_x$. This is the required expression for $L_z$.\n\nNow we evaluate the Poisson brackets $\\{r, p_r\\}$ and $\\{r, L_z\\}$ using the specified Cartesian definition:\n$$\n\\{f, g\\} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_x} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_x}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p_y} - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_y}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}\n$$\nLet us compute $\\{r, p_r\\}$. Here, $f = r = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}$ and $g = p_r = (x p_x + y p_y)(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}$.\nSince $r$ is a function of coordinates only, $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial p_x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial p_y} = 0$. The bracket simplifies to:\n$$\n\\{r, p_r\\} = \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial p_x} + \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial p_y}\n$$\nThe necessary partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}(2x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \\frac{x}{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial y} = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \\frac{y}{r}\n$$\nNow for the derivatives of $p_r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial p_x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_x} \\left( \\frac{x p_x + y p_y}{r} \\right) = \\frac{x}{r}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p_r}{\\partial p_y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_y} \\left( \\frac{x p_x + y p_y}{r} \\right) = \\frac{y}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the simplified Poisson bracket expression:\n$$\n\\{r, p_r\\} = \\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{y}{r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y}{r}\\right) = \\frac{x^2}{r^2} + \\frac{y^2}{r^2} = \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{r^2} = \\frac{r^2}{r^2} = 1\n$$\nThis is the first result.\n\nNext, we compute $\\{r, L_z\\}$. Here, $f = r = (x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$ and $g = L_z = x p_y - y p_x$.\nAgain, $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial p_x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial p_y} = 0$. The bracket simplifies to:\n$$\n\\{r, L_z\\} = \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial L_z}{\\partial p_x} + \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial L_z}{\\partial p_y}\n$$\nThe derivatives of $r$ are the same as before. The derivatives of $L_z$ with respect to momenta are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_z}{\\partial p_x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_x}(x p_y - y p_x) = -y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L_z}{\\partial p_y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_y}(x p_y - y p_x) = x\n$$\nSubstituting these into the bracket expression:\n$$\n\\{r, L_z\\} = \\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right)(-y) + \\left(\\frac{y}{r}\\right)(x) = \\frac{-xy + yx}{r} = \\frac{0}{r} = 0\n$$\nThis is the second result.\n\nFinally, we interpret the results. In Hamiltonian mechanics, a pair of phase space variables $(q, p)$ is defined as canonically conjugate if their fundamental Poisson bracket is unity, i.e., $\\{q, p\\} = 1$.\nSince we found $\\{r, p_r\\} = 1$, the pair $(r, p_r)$ is a canonically conjugate pair. The variable $p_r$ is the momentum conjugate to the radial coordinate $r$.\nSince we found $\\{r, L_z\\} = 0$, the pair $(r, L_z)$ is not canonically conjugate. The vanishing of the Poisson bracket indicates that the quantities $r$ and $L_z$ commute.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row vector containing the values of $\\{r, p_r\\}$ and $\\{r, L_z\\}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2795125"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idea of verifying conjugacy, we now generalize to the concept of a canonical transformationâ€”any change of phase space variables that preserves the fundamental structure of Hamilton's equations.

Therefore, its partial derivative with respect to any position component $r_{c,k}$ is also identically zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_j}{\\partial r_{c,k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_{c,k}} \\left( \\sum_{b=1}^{N} p_{b,j} \\right) = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the second term of the Poisson bracket vanishes, as $\\frac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial p_{c,k}} \\frac{\\partial P_j}{\\partial r_{c,k}} = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nThe Poisson bracket simplifies to:\n$$\n\\{R_i, P_j\\} = \\sum_{c=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial r_{c,k}} \\frac{\\partial P_j}{\\partial p_{c,k}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the remaining two partial derivatives.\nThe derivative of $R_i$ with respect to the position component $r_{c,k}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial r_{c,k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_{c,k}} \\left( \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{a=1}^{N} m_a r_{a,i} \\right) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{a=1}^{N} m_a \\frac{\\partial r_{a,i}}{\\partial r_{c,k}}\n$$\nThe partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial r_{a,i}}{\\partial r_{c,k}}$ equals $1$ if and only if $a=c$ and $i=k$. This is represented by the product of Kronecker deltas, $\\delta_{ac} \\delta_{ik}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial r_{c,k}} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{a=1}^{N} m_a \\delta_{ac} \\delta_{ik}\n$$\nThe summation over $a$ collapses due to the presence of $\\delta_{ac}$, which selects only the term where $a=c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial r_{c,k}} = \\frac{m_c}{M} \\delta_{ik}\n$$\nNext, the derivative of $P_j$ with respect to the momentum component $p_{c,k}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_j}{\\partial p_{c,k}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{c,k}} \\left( \\sum_{b=1}^{N} p_{b,j} \\right) = \\sum_{b=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial p_{b,j}}{\\partial p_{c,k}}\n$$\nThe partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial p_{b,j}}{\\partial p_{c,k}}$ is equal to $\\delta_{bc} \\delta_{jk}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_j}{\\partial p_{c,k}} = \\sum_{b=1}^{N} \\delta_{bc} \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nThe summation over $b$ collapses due to $\\delta_{bc}$, selecting the term where $b=c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial P_j}{\\partial p_{c,k}} = \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nWe now substitute these results back into the simplified expression for the Poisson bracket:\n$$\n\\{R_i, P_j\\} = \\sum_{c=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{m_c}{M} \\delta_{ik} \\right) (\\delta_{jk}) = \\sum_{c=1}^{N} \\frac{m_c}{M} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jk} \\right)\n$$\nThe sum over the index $k$ involves a product of Kronecker deltas. This sum has a known property: $\\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jk} = \\delta_{ij}$. This identity holds because for the product $\\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jk}$ to be non-zero, it must be that $k=i$ and $k=j$ simultaneously, which implies $i=j$. If $i \\neq j$, the product is zero for all $k$, and the sum is zero. If $i=j$, the sum becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\delta_{ik}^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\delta_{ik} = 1$. In both cases, the result is $\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nSubstituting this identity into our expression:\n$$\n\\{R_i, P_j\\} = \\sum_{c=1}^{N} \\frac{m_c}{M} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThe terms $\\frac{1}{M}$ and $\\delta_{ij}$ are constant with respect to the summation over the particle index $c$. They can be factored out of the sum:\n$$\n\\{R_i, P_j\\} = \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{M} \\sum_{c=1}^{N} m_c\n$$\nBy definition of the total mass $M$, we have $\\sum_{c=1}^{N} m_c = M$.\nTherefore, the final result is:\n$$\n\\{R_i, P_j\\} = \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{M} (M) = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the components of the center-of-mass position and the total momentum form a set of canonical variables, satisfying the fundamental Poisson bracket relation $\\{q_i, p_j\\} = \\delta_{ij}$. The collective motion of the center of mass is thus canonically equivalent to that of a single particle with mass $M$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\delta_{ij}}\n$$", "id": "2795158"}]}
