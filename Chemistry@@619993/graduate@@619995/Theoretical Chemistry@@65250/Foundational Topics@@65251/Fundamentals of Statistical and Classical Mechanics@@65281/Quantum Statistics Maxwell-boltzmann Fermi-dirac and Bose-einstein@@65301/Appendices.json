It correctly employs the concepts of fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle, spin degeneracy, and the canonical ensemble. The physical model, while simplified, is a valid and widely used approximation for systems like diatomic molecules or localized electronic states. It is free of any pseudoscience or factual error.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information (number and type of particles, energy spectrum, degeneracies, statistical ensemble) to determine a unique and physically meaningful solution for the average energy $\\langle E \\rangle(T)$.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous language, devoid of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem statement is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem of theoretical chemistry. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to identify the available single-particle quantum states. The system has two spatial energy levels, $\\varepsilon_1 = 0$ and $\\varepsilon_2 = \\Delta$. Each level is two-fold spin-degenerate, corresponding to spin projections $m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-up, $\\uparrow$) and $m_s = -\\frac{1}{2}$ (spin-down, $\\downarrow$). This yields a total of four distinct single-particle states:\n1.  Energy $0$, spin $\\uparrow$: $|0, \\uparrow\\rangle$\n2.  Energy $0$, spin $\\downarrow$: $|0, \\downarrow\\rangle$\n3.  Energy $\\Delta$, spin $\\uparrow$: $|\\Delta, \\uparrow\\rangle$\n4.  Energy $\\Delta$, spin $\\downarrow$: $|\\Delta, \\downarrow\\rangle$\n\nWe must place $N=2$ identical fermions into these four states. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Therefore, a valid two-particle microstate is formed by choosing two distinct single-particle states from the four available. Since the fermions are indistinguishable, the order of selection is irrelevant. The total number of allowed many-body microstates is the number of ways to choose $2$ states from a set of $4$, which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$N_{\\text{states}} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$$\nWe now enumerate these $6$ microstates and their total energies. The total energy $E$ of a microstate is the sum of the energies of the two occupied single-particle states.\n\n1.  **Ground State Configuration**: The two fermions occupy the two lowest-energy single-particle states available: $|0, \\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|0, \\downarrow\\rangle$.\n    - Total Energy: $E_0 = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n    - There is only one way to achieve this. Thus, the degeneracy of this energy level is $g(0) = 1$.\n\n2.  **First Excited State Configurations**: One fermion is in a state with energy $0$ and the other is in a state with energy $\\Delta$. We must consider all possible spin combinations.\n    - Fermions in $|0, \\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|\\Delta, \\uparrow\\rangle$. Total Energy: $E_1 = 0 + \\Delta = \\Delta$.\n    - Fermions in $|0, \\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|\\Delta, \\downarrow\\rangle$. Total Energy: $E_1 = 0 + \\Delta = \\Delta$.\n    - Fermions in $|0, \\downarrow\\rangle$ and $|\\Delta, \\uparrow\\rangle$. Total Energy: $E_1 = 0 + \\Delta = \\Delta$.\n    - Fermions in $|0, \\downarrow\\rangle$ and $|\\Delta, \\downarrow\\rangle$. Total Energy: $E_1 = 0 + \\Delta = \\Delta$.\n    - There are four distinct microstates that result in a total energy of $\\Delta$. Thus, the degeneracy of this energy level is $g(\\Delta) = 4$.\n\n3.  **Second Excited State Configuration**: The two fermions occupy the two highest-energy single-particle states available: $|\\Delta, \\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|\\Delta, \\downarrow\\rangle$.\n    - Total Energy: $E_2 = \\Delta + \\Delta = 2\\Delta$.\n    - There is only one way to achieve this. Thus, the degeneracy of this energy level is $g(2\\Delta) = 1$.\n\nThe enumeration is complete. The many-body energy levels are $0$, $\\Delta$, and $2\\Delta$, with degeneracies $1$, $4$, and $1$ respectively. The sum of degeneracies is $1+4+1=6$, confirming our initial count.\n\nNext, we derive the canonical partition function for this two-fermion system, $Z_2(T)$. The partition function is the sum over all allowed many-body energy levels, weighted by their degeneracy and the Boltzmann factor.\n$$Z_2(T) = \\sum_{j} g(E_j) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_j}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the energies and degeneracies we found:\n$$Z_2(T) = g(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{k_B T}\\right) + g(\\Delta) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + g(2\\Delta) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$Z_2(T) = (1) \\exp(0) + (4) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + (1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$Z_2(T) = 1 + 4\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we obtain the average energy $\\langle E \\rangle(T)$ from the partition function.

Using the second form is more direct. We express $Z_2$ as a function of $\\beta$:\n$$Z_2(\\beta) = 1 + 4\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)$$\nNow, we compute the derivative of its natural logarithm:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln\\left(1 + 4\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)\\right)$$\nApplying the chain rule for derivatives, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(u) = \\frac{1}{u}\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{Z_2(\\beta)} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(1 + 4\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)\\right)$$\nThe derivative of the term in parenthesis is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(1 + 4\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)\\right) = 4(-\\Delta)\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + (-2\\Delta)\\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)$$\n$$= -4\\Delta\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) - 2\\Delta\\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{1 + 4\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)} \\left[-4\\Delta\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) - 2\\Delta\\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)\\right]$$\n$$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{4\\Delta\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + 2\\Delta\\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)}{1 + 4\\exp(-\\beta\\Delta) + \\exp(-2\\beta\\Delta)}$$\nThe final step is to replace $\\beta$ with $\\frac{1}{k_B T}$ to express the average energy as a function of temperature:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle(T) = \\frac{4\\Delta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + 2\\Delta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + 4\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the exact average energy of the system as a function of $T$, $\\Delta$, and $k_B$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4\\Delta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + 2\\Delta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + 4\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_B T}\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "2798479"}, {"introduction": "Having explored a fermionic system, we now turn to its bosonic counterpart to directly contrast the two fundamental types of quantum statistics.

A spin-up particle contributes $+\\mu$ and a spin-down particle contributes $-\\mu$:\n$$ M(B) = \\mu \\bar{N}_{+} - \\mu \\bar{N}_{-} = 2\\mu [f(\\varepsilon_{+}) - f(\\varepsilon_{-})] $$\n\nThe linear magnetic susceptibility under Fermi-Dirac statistics, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}$, is defined as the first derivative of the magnetization with respect to the magnetic field, evaluated at $B=0$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B}\\right|_{B=0} $$\nWe compute the derivative of $M(B)$ using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B} = 2\\mu \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f(\\varepsilon_{+})}{\\partial B} - \\frac{\\partial f(\\varepsilon_{-})}{\\partial B} \\right] $$\nThe derivatives of the energy levels are $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{+}}{\\partial B} = -\\mu$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{-}}{\\partial B} = +\\mu$. This gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B} = 2\\mu \\left[ \\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{+}}\\right) \\cdot (-\\mu) - \\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{-}}\\right) \\cdot (+\\mu) \\right] = -2\\mu^{2} \\left[ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{+}} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{-}} \\right] $$\nTo find $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}$, we evaluate this expression at $B=0$. At $B=0$, we have $\\varepsilon_{+} = \\varepsilon_{-} = \\varepsilon_{0}$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}} = -2\\mu^{2} \\left[ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} + \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} \\right] = -4\\mu^{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} $$\nThe derivative of the FD distribution function with respect to energy is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f(\\epsilon)}{\\partial \\epsilon} = -\\frac{\\beta \\exp(\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}}))}{(1 + \\exp(\\beta(\\epsilon - \\mu_{\\mathrm{c}})))^{2}} $$\nThis can be expressed in terms of $f(\\epsilon)$ as $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon} = -\\beta f(\\epsilon)(1-f(\\epsilon))$. The problem defines $f_{0}$ as the FD occupation at zero field for energy $\\varepsilon_{0}$, i.e., $f_{0} = f(\\varepsilon_{0})$. Therefore:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon_{0}} = -\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0}) $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}} = -4\\mu^{2} [-\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0})] = 4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0}) $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the MB Curie susceptibility, which is defined as $\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}} \\equiv \\mu^{2} \\beta \\,\\bar{N}_{0}$. We must first find the zero-field mean particle number, $\\bar{N}_{0}$. At $B=0$, the system has $4$ degenerate states, each with energy $\\varepsilon_{0}$. The occupation of each of these states is $f_{0}$. The total mean number of particles is:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{0} = 4 \\times f_{0} = 4f_{0} $$\nUsing the given definition of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}$:\n$$ \\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}} = \\mu^{2}\\beta \\bar{N}_{0} = \\mu^{2}\\beta (4f_{0}) = 4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}/\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}} = \\frac{4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}(1 - f_{0})}{4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}} $$\nFor any physically meaningful system where particles can exist ($f_{0} > 0$), we can simplify this expression by canceling the common terms $4\\mu^{2}\\beta f_{0}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{MB}}} = 1 - f_{0} $$\nThis result shows that the susceptibility for fermions is reduced from the classical (MB) value by a factor $(1 - f_{0})$, which accounts for the Pauli exclusion principle: a particle can only be excited to a higher-energy spin state if that state is unoccupied, an event with probability $(1 - f_{0})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - f_{0}}$$", "id": "2798469"}]}
