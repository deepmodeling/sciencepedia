It requires the application of fundamental principles of the canonical ensemble to model the vibrational properties of diatomic molecules. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of noninteracting diatomic molecules, so we can analyze a single molecule's partition function. According to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the total molecular partition function $q$ can be factorized into contributions from different degrees of freedom: translational ($q_{\\mathrm{trans}}$), rotational ($q_{\\mathrm{rot}}$), vibrational ($q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$), and electronic ($q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$). The problem states that the electronic ground state is isolated and non-degenerate, so $q_{\\mathrm{elec}}$ is a constant which we can set to $1$. The rotational states are assumed to be independent of the vibrational states. Therefore, the population of vibrational levels is determined solely by the vibrational partition function and the temperature.\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the probability $P_v$ of finding a molecule in a specific vibrational state $v$ with energy $E_v$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$P_v = \\frac{g_v \\exp(-\\beta E_v)}{q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}$$\nwhere $g_v$ is the degeneracy of the level $v$, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$ is the inverse thermal energy with $k_B$ being the Boltzmann constant, and $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the vibrational partition function, $q_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\sum_v g_v \\exp(-\\beta E_v)$. For a large number $N$ of molecules, the population of a level $v$ is $N_v = N P_v$. The ratio of the populations of the first excited vibrational state ($v=1$) to the ground state ($v=0$) is therefore:\n$$\\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \\frac{N P_1}{N P_0} = \\frac{g_1 \\exp(-\\beta E_1) / q_{\\mathrm{vib}}}{g_0 \\exp(-\\beta E_0) / q_{\\mathrm{vib}}} = \\frac{g_1}{g_0} \\exp(-\\beta(E_1 - E_0))$$\nThe vibrational motion is modeled as a quantum harmonic oscillator, whose energy levels are non-degenerate, so $g_v = 1$ for all $v$. The energy levels are given by $E_v = h c \\tilde{\\nu} \\left(v + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is the spectroscopic wavenumber, and $v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the vibrational quantum number.\nThe energy of the ground state is $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2} h c \\tilde{\\nu}$ and the energy of the first excited state is $E_1 = \\frac{3}{2} h c \\tilde{\\nu}$. The energy difference is $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = h c \\tilde{\\nu}$.\nThe population ratio simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the temperature $T_{\\ast}$**\n\nThe problem defines the temperature $T_{\\ast}$ as the temperature at which the ratio $\\frac{N_1}{N_0}$ equals $0.10$. We set this condition and solve for $T_{\\ast}$:\n$$0.10 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T_{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(0.10) = -\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T_{\\ast}}$$\nSince $\\ln(0.10) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10)$, we have:\n$$-\\ln(10) = -\\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B T_{\\ast}}$$\nSolving for $T_{\\ast}$ gives the first required expression:\n$$T_{\\ast} = \\frac{h c \\tilde{\\nu}}{k_B \\ln(10)}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the temperature in Kelvin, as all constants would be in SI units for a numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the heat capacity ratio $C_{V,\\mathrm{vib}}(T_{\\ast})/R$**\n\nTo find the vibrational contribution to the molar heat capacity, we first must derive the average vibrational energy. This begins with the vibrational partition function $q_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ for the harmonic oscillator.

It is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of the Born–Oppenheimer and Rigid Rotor Harmonic Oscillator approximations, and its stated assumptions, while simplifying physical reality, serve a clear pedagogical purpose: to isolate the contribution of rotational symmetry to a chemical equilibrium. We shall now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental connection between the macroscopic properties of a system, such as the equilibrium constant, and the microscopic properties of its constituent molecules is established through the canonical partition function. For a single molecule, the partition function, $q$, is defined as the sum over all its quantum states $i$, weighted by their Boltzmann factors:\n$$ q = \\sum_{i} g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon_i}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_i$ is the energy of state $i$, $g_i$ is its degeneracy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWithin the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic and nuclear motions are considered separable. Furthermore, if we assume the molecular energy can be expressed as a sum of independent contributions from translation, rotation, vibration, and electronic states, then:\n$$ E_{\\text{total}} = E_{\\text{trans}} + E_{\\text{rot}} + E_{\\text{vib}} + E_{\\text{elec}} $$\nThis additivity in energy leads to a multiplicative factorization of the molecular partition function:\n$$ q = q_{\\text{trans}} q_{\\text{rot}} q_{\\text{vib}} q_{\\text{elec}} $$\n\nThe central part of this problem concerns the rotational partition function, $q_{\\text{rot}}$. In the high-temperature limit, where the rotational energy spacing is small compared to $k_B T$, the sum over discrete rotational energy levels can be replaced by an integral. For a linear molecule, this yields:\n$$ q'_{\\text{rot}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h^2 J(J+1)}{8 \\pi^2 I k_B T}\\right) dJ \\approx \\frac{8 \\pi^2 I k_B T}{h^2} $$\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia and $J$ is the rotational quantum number.\n\nThis classical expression, however, overcounts the number of accessible unique quantum states for molecules containing identical nuclei, such as $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{D_2}$. The Pauli exclusion principle mandates that the total wavefunction of a system must be either symmetric (for bosons) or antisymmetric (for fermions) with respect to the exchange of any pair of identical particles. For a homonuclear diatomic molecule, the nuclei are identical. The total nuclear wavefunction, which is approximately a product of rotational and nuclear spin wavefunctions ($\\Psi_{\\text{nuclear}} \\approx \\psi_{\\text{rot}} \\psi_{\\text{ns}}$), must obey this symmetry requirement. This coupling restricts the allowed combinations of rotational states (with symmetry $(-1)^J$) and nuclear spin states.\n\nIn the high-temperature limit, the net effect of these quantum symmetry constraints is a simple division of the classical rotational partition function by a factor known as the symmetry number, $\\sigma$. The symmetry number is the number of indistinguishable orientations of the molecule that can be generated by rigid rotations. The corrected rotational partition function is therefore:\n$$ q_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{q'_{\\text{rot}}}{\\sigma} = \\frac{8 \\pi^2 I k_B T}{\\sigma h^2} $$\n\nWe now determine the symmetry number for each species in the reaction:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{D_2}$: These are homonuclear diatomic molecules.

This means the rotational energies $E_J$ are the same, and consequently, the value of $S$ is the same for both $^{14}\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{2}$.\n\nUsing this approximation, the partition functions become:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(^{14}\\mathrm{N}_{2}) \\approx 6 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{even}} + 3 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{odd}} \\approx 6S + 3S = 9S$$\n$$q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{2}) \\approx 1 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{even}} + 3 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{odd}} \\approx 1S + 3S = 4S$$\nThe desired ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(^{15}\\mathrm{N}_{2})}{q_{\\mathrm{rot}}(^{14}\\mathrm{N}_{2})} \\approx \\frac{4S}{9S} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nThis result is exact in the high-temperature limit.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}\n$$", "id": "2817561"}]}
