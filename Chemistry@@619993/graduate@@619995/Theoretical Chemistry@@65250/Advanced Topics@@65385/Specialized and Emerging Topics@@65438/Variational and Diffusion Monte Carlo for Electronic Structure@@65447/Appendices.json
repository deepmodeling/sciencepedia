Suppose that at a given Monte Carlo step you have both $S$ and its inverse $S^{-1}$ available. You propose a single-electron move that changes only electron $k$ from $\\mathbf{r}_k$ to $\\mathbf{r}_k'$, thereby replacing the $k$-th row $a_k^T$ of $S$ (with entries $a_{k,j} = \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_k)$) by the new row $p^T$ (with entries $p_j = \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_k')$), producing an updated Slater matrix $S'$.\n\nSelect all statements that correctly describe how to evaluate the determinant ratio $\\det(S')/\\det(S)$ and how to update $S^{-1}$ efficiently under this single-electron move using rank-one updates, and that correctly analyze numerical conditioning issues that arise when the occupied orbitals are nearly linearly dependent at the electron positions.\n\nOptions:\n- A. The row replacement can be written as a rank-one update $S' = S + u v^T$ with $u = e_k$ (the $k$-th standard basis vector) and $v = p - a_k$. The determinant ratio equals $r = p^T (S^{-1} e_k)$ and the inverse can be updated by the Sherman–Morrison formula $S'^{-1} = S^{-1} - \\dfrac{S^{-1} u v^T S^{-1}}{r}$ at cost $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ per accepted move. The denominator $r$ can be small near nodal surfaces, causing loss of accuracy; periodic refactorization of $S$ using a pivoted factorization mitigates this.\n\n- B. Because the occupied molecular orbitals are orthonormal, the Slater matrix $S$ is orthogonal for any configuration, so its $2$-norm condition number $\\kappa_2(S)$ equals $1$, and Sherman–Morrison updates are unconditionally stable without any need for stabilization.\n\n- C.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, describing a core computational task in electronic structure QMC methods. I will proceed with a full derivation and analysis of the options.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe new Slater matrix $S'$ is obtained from the old one $S$ by replacing the $k$-th row. Let $e_k$ be the $k$-th standard basis vector (a column vector with $1$ at position $k$ and $0$ elsewhere). The change from $S$ to $S'$ can be written as the addition of a matrix that is zero everywhere except in the $k$-th row, where it equals $p^T - a_k^T$. This is a rank-one update:\n$$ S' = S + e_k(p - a_k)^T $$\nThis update is of the form $S' = S + uv^T$, with vector $u = e_k$ and vector $v = p - a_k$.\n\n**Determinant Ratio**\nAccording to the matrix determinant lemma, $\\det(A + uv^T) = (1 + v^T A^{-1} u) \\det(A)$. The ratio of determinants is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\det(S')}{\\det(S)} = 1 + v^T S^{-1} u = 1 + (p - a_k)^T S^{-1} e_k $$\nLet's analyze the term $a_k^T S^{-1} e_k$. The vector $a_k^T$ is the $k$-th row of $S$. The vector $S^{-1} e_k$ is the $k$-th column of $S^{-1}$. Their product is the $(k,k)$-th element of the matrix product $S S^{-1}$.\n$$ a_k^T (S^{-1} e_k) = \\sum_{j=1}^N S_{kj} (S^{-1})_{jk} = (S S^{-1})_{kk} = I_{kk} = 1 $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\det(S')}{\\det(S)} = 1 + p^T S^{-1} e_k - a_k^T S^{-1} e_k = 1 + p^T S^{-1} e_k - 1 = p^T S^{-1} e_k $$\nThis ratio, which we shall call $r$, can be computed in $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time, as it is a dot product between the new row $p^T$ and the $k$-th column of the existing inverse $S^{-1}$.\n\n**Inverse Update**\nThe Sherman-Morrison formula gives the inverse of a rank-one updated matrix:\n$$ (A + uv^T)^{-1} = A^{-1} - \\frac{A^{-1}uv^T A^{-1}}{1 + v^T A^{-1} u} $$\nSubstituting $A=S$, $u=e_k$, $v=p-a_k$, and noting that the denominator is the determinant ratio $r = p^T S^{-1} e_k$, we get:\n$$ (S')^{-1} = S^{-1} - \\frac{(S^{-1}e_k)( (p-a_k)^T S^{-1})}{r} $$\nThe computational cost of this update is dominated by the matrix-vector product $(p-a_k)^T S^{-1}$ and the outer product of two vectors, both of which are $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operations.\n\n**Numerical Conditioning**\nNumerical instability can arise from two main sources:\n1.  **Acute Instability**: If the denominator $|r| = |\\det(S')/\\det(S)|$ is close to zero, the update formula involves division by a small number, which amplifies rounding errors catastrophically. This occurs when the proposed electron position $\\mathbf{r}_k'$ lies near a nodal surface of the trial wavefunction, making the new matrix $S'$ nearly singular.\n2.  **Cumulative Instability**: Even if all individual updates are stable, the repeated application of the update formula can lead to the accumulation of rounding errors. The magnitude of error propagation is related to the condition number of the matrices involved, $\\kappa(S) = \\|S\\|\\|S^{-1}\\|$. If $S$ is ill-conditioned (i.e., its columns are nearly linearly dependent), errors in the stored inverse $S^{-1}$ can grow over time.\n\nStandard mitigation strategies include periodically recomputing the inverse $S^{-1}$ from scratch using a numerically stable algorithm like LU or QR factorization with pivoting. More advanced schemes monitor an estimate of the condition number and trigger recomputation only when necessary.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A**\nThis statement claims $S' = S + uv^T$ with $u=e_k$ and $v=p-a_k$, which is correct. It gives the determinant ratio as $r = p^T (S^{-1} e_k)$, which is correct. It provides the Sherman-Morrison update as $S'^{-1} = S^{-1} - \\dfrac{S^{-1} u v^T S^{-1}}{r}$, which is also correct, with the denominator $r$ being the determinant ratio. The cost is correctly identified as $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. The analysis of numerical stability is also correct: a small denominator $r$ near nodal surfaces causes loss of accuracy, and periodic refactorization with a pivoted algorithm is a valid mitigation strategy. All parts of this statement are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B**\nThis statement claims that because the molecular orbitals are orthonormal (i.e., $\\int \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = \\delta_{ij}$), the Slater matrix $S$ is orthogonal. This is fundamentally false. The Slater matrix elements are $S_{ij} = \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_i)$. The orthogonality of the matrix $S$ would require its columns (or rows) to be orthonormal vectors, i.e., $\\sum_{l=1}^N S_{li} S_{lj} = \\delta_{ij}$. This sum is $\\sum_{l=1}^N \\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}_l) \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_l)$, which is a sum over a discrete set of points and is not, in general, equal to the integral that defines orbital orthonormality. The matrix $S$ is generally not orthogonal and can be very ill-conditioned ($\\kappa_2(S) \\gg 1$), for instance when two electrons are close to each other. Consequently, the conclusion that Sherman-Morrison updates are unconditionally stable is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C**\nThis statement proposes the formula $\\prod_{j=1}^N \\dfrac{\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_k')}{\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_k)}$ for the determinant ratio. This is incorrect. The determinant is a multilinear function of its rows, but it does not behave this way for a row replacement unless the new row is a scalar multiple of the old row, which is not the case here. The correct formula, $r = p^T(S^{-1}e_k)$, involves the inverse matrix and mixes contributions from all orbitals, as shown in the derivation. A simple $2 \\times 2$ counterexample demonstrates the incorrectness of this proposed formula.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D**\nThis option swaps the roles of $u$ and $v$, claiming $u = p - a_k$ and $v = e_k$. This would correspond to an update of the form $S' = S + (p - a_k)e_k^T$, which modifies the $k$-th column of $S$, not the $k$-th row as specified in the problem. The formula shown for the inverse mixes signs from different forms of the Sherman-Morrison identity. It incorrectly claims a computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, whereas the update of the inverse is an $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operation. Finally, it wrongly asserts that the denominator cannot vanish, while it can and will vanish on a nodal surface. This option is incorrect on multiple fundamental points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E**\nThis statement correctly identifies the determinant ratio $r = p^T (S^{-1} e_k)$ and the correct form of the Sherman-Morrison update with $u = e_k$, $v = p - a_k$, and cost $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. Its analysis of numerical conditioning is superior and more comprehensive than that of option A. It correctly identifies two sources of error amplification: ill-conditioning of $S$ (large $\\kappa_2(S)$) and acute instability from a small ratio $|r|$. It proposes a robust, adaptive mitigation strategy: monitoring a condition number estimate from a pivoted factorization (LU or QR) and recomputing the inverse when a threshold is met. It also correctly mentions \"delayed updates\" using the Woodbury identity as another valid technique to improve both performance and numerical stability. All parts of this statement are correct and reflect best practices in modern QMC implementations.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2828331"}, {"introduction": "While Diffusion Monte Carlo can achieve high accuracy, its results are fundamentally limited by the fixed-node approximation, which constrains the simulation to the nodal pockets defined by the trial wavefunction $\\Psi_T$.

It presents a standard, albeit advanced, problem in theoretical and computational chemistry, concerning the performance of different trial wavefunction forms within the fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo framework. The concepts invoked—static correlation, fixed-node error, Slater-Jastrow, multideterminant expansions, and backflow—are all standard in the field. The scenario of a stretched diatomic molecule is a canonical example used to test methods for strong correlation. The problem statement does not contain scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the variational principle of fixed-node DMC: a more accurate nodal surface $\\mathcal{N}(\\Psi_T)$ yields a lower fixed-node energy $E_{\\mathrm{FN}}$, and thus a smaller fixed-node error $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}$. The task is to rank the quality of the nodal surfaces produced by the three trial wavefunctions for a system dominated by static correlation.\n\nThe system is a homonuclear diatomic molecule with a stretched bond, a classic case of strong static correlation. This arises because the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) becomes very small, leading to near-degeneracy. For $\\mathrm{N}_2$ at stretched geometries, the ground state becomes strongly multiconfigurational, requiring a linear combination of Slater determinants involving excitations from bonding to antibonding orbitals to be described correctly.\n\nLet us analyze each trial wavefunction in this context:\n\n1.  **Single-determinant Slater-Jastrow ($\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{SD}}$)**: The nodes of this wavefunction are determined by a single Slater determinant, $D[\\{\\phi_p\\}]$. A single-determinant description (e.g., from Restricted Hartree-Fock) is qualitatively incorrect for a stretched covalent bond. It fails to describe the dissociation into neutral fragments, leading to an incorrect potential energy surface and a poor electronic structure description. Consequently, its nodal surface is expected to be highly inaccurate for this regime, resulting in a large fixed-node error, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}}$. This serves as our baseline of poorest performance.\n\n2.  **Multideterminant Slater-Jastrow ($\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{MD}}$)**: This wavefunction directly addresses the primary deficiency of $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{SD}}$. By constructing the fermionic part as a linear combination of determinants, $\\sum_{k} c_k D_k$, chosen from a compact active space (as specified), it allows the wavefunction to have the correct multireference character. This is the physically appropriate way to treat static correlation. The resulting nodal surface, defined by $\\sum_{k} c_k D_k = 0$, can have a different, more complex topology than that of a single determinant, correctly capturing the physics of the stretched bond. This leads to a substantial reduction in the fixed-node error compared to the single-determinant case. Therefore, we expect $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} \\ll \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}}$.\n\n3.  **Backflow-augmented Single-Determinant Slater-Jastrow ($\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$)**: Backflow introduces an electron-electron coordinate dependence into the orbitals of a single determinant. The transformation $\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\mathbf{r}_i + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_i(\\mathbf{R})$ makes the nodal surface flexible, allowing it to deform in response to the positions of other electrons. This is an extremely powerful method for capturing dynamic correlation, which is associated with the short-range avoidance of electrons. By allowing the nodes to \"move away\" from other electrons, backflow can recover a very large fraction of the correlation energy. It is a significant improvement over the rigid nodes of $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{SD}}$, so we must have $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}} < \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}}$.\n\nNow, we must compare $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{MD}}$ and $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$.\n- $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{MD}}$ uses the correct zero-order physical picture for static correlation (a multiconfigurational state) but may be less effective for dynamic correlation unless a very large number of determinants is used.\n- $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$ is very effective for dynamic correlation but is built upon a qualitatively incorrect zero-order picture (a single determinant).\nThe problem specifies \"strong static correlation\". While backflow deformations are powerful, they are smooth, continuous changes to the nodal geometry. They are typically insufficient to induce the necessary topological changes in the nodal surface required to fix a qualitatively incorrect single-reference description. A multideterminant expansion, in contrast, directly and efficiently introduces the correct physics by mixing electronic configurations, which can fundamentally alter the nodal topology. For a problem dominated by static correlation, the multideterminant approach is more direct and generally more effective at improving the nodes than a backflow transformation applied to a single determinant. Thus, one expects the nodes of $\\Psi_T^{\\mathrm{MD}}$ to be more accurate.\n\nThis leads to the following inequality for the fixed-node errors: $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} < \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$.\n\nCombining all comparisons, we arrive at the final qualitative ordering of fixed-node errors, from largest to smallest:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on this derived ordering and reasoning.\n\nA. $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}}$. Multideterminant mixing changes the nodal surface in a way that captures near-degenerate static correlation; backflow primarily provides smooth deformations well-suited to dynamic correlation, so it improves upon single-determinant nodes but typically less than a compact multideterminant in the stretched regime.\nThis option presents the exact error ordering derived from our analysis. The rationale provided is also precisely correct: it correctly identifies that a multideterminant expansion is the proper way to handle static correlation and that backflow, while an improvement, is fundamentally a smooth deformation of a single-determinant nodal surface and thus less suited for this specific type of correlation. **Correct**.\n\nB. $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$. Backflow directly modifies electron coordinates and therefore always provides the lowest fixed-node error regardless of correlation type.\nThe ordering is incorrect, placing backflow as superior to the multideterminant expansion. The reasoning is flawed; the statement that backflow \"always\" provides the lowest error is an unsubstantiated and incorrect generalization. The efficacy of a method is dependent on the nature of the electronic correlation. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}} = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$. In DMC, the projector removes bias independent of the nodal surface, so all three yield the same energy in the long-time limit.\nThis displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the fixed-node approximation. The final DMC energy is entirely dependent on the nodes of the trial wavefunction. Different nodal surfaces produce different energies. The statement is factually wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}} < \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} \\approx \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$. In stretched bonds, single-determinant Hartree–Fock nodes become exact as the system dissociates, so adding more flexibility cannot improve the fixed-node error.\nThe ordering is inverted. The reasoning is also factually wrong. For molecules like $\\mathrm{N}_2$, the single-determinant (Hartree-Fock) description of dissociation is qualitatively incorrect, and its nodes are far from exact. For this system, the dissociated limit of two N atoms requires a multideterminant wavefunction for a proper description of the overall singlet spin state. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}} < \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} < \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}}$. Backflow can arbitrarily change the number of nodal cells and therefore always outperforms multideterminant expansions, even for strong static correlation.\nThe ordering is $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SD}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{MD}} > \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{FN}}^{\\mathrm{SDBF}}$, which is the same as in option B. The reasoning is factually incorrect. A backflow transformation is a diffeomorphism, a continuous and invertible mapping. Such a transformation cannot change the topology of the nodal surface, such as the number of disconnected nodal cells (pockets). A multideterminant expansion, however, can change the nodal topology. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2828280"}]}
