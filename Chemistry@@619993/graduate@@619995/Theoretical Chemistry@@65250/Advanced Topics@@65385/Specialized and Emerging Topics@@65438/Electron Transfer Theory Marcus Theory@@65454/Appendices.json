To see this, equate the Gaussian curvature $1 / (\\beta \\sigma^{2})$ with the Marcus curvature $1/(4 \\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\beta \\sigma^{2}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\lambda} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sigma^{2} = 2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\lambda.\n$$\nThe minima of the two parabolas occur at $X = \\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and $X = \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}$, respectively. The standard reaction free energy $\\Delta G^{0}$ is the free energy difference between these minima:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{0} = G_{\\mathrm{A}}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}) - G_{\\mathrm{D}}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}) = C_{\\mathrm{A}} - C_{\\mathrm{D}}.\n$$\nBecause the two parabolas have equal curvature, the geometry of parabolas implies that the distance between the minima along $X$ is $|\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}|$, and the midpoint between the minima projects to the crossing symmetry that yields the relationships\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}}{2}, \\qquad \\Delta G^{0} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}}{2}.\n$$\nThese identities can be derived explicitly by expressing the two parabolas as equal-curvature quadratics whose vertex abscissas are $\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and whose vertical offsets differ by $\\Delta G^{0}$; enforcing the known gap at the crossing and symmetry about the vertical bisector yields the above symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.\n\nThus we obtain two distinct but consistent routes to estimate the reorganization energy:\n1. Mean-gap estimator based on the donor and acceptor averages,\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}}{2}.\n$$\n2. Variance estimators based on the equal-curvature relation $\\sigma^{2} = 2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\lambda$, separately on each surface,\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,D}} = \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{D}}^{2}}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}, \\qquad\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,A}} = \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{A}}^{2}}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T},\n$$\nwhere $s_{i}^{2}$ are the unbiased sample variances that estimate $\\sigma_{i}^{2}$.\n\nUncertainty estimation:\n- For independent donor and acceptor sampling, the standard errors of the sample means are\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{D}}^{2}}{n_{\\mathrm{D}}}}, \\qquad\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{A}}^{2}}{n_{\\mathrm{A}}}}.\n$$\nPropagating these to $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ and $\\Delta G^{0}$ yields\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SE}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}})^{2} + \\mathrm{SE}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}})^{2}}, \\qquad\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\Delta G^{0}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SE}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}})^{2} + \\mathrm{SE}(\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}})^{2}}.\n$$\n- For the variance-based estimates, under normality the sampling variance of the unbiased sample variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(s^{2}) = \\dfrac{2 \\sigma^{4}}{n - 1}$. Using $s^{2}$ as a plug-in estimator for $\\sigma^{2}$, the standard errors for the variance-based reorganization energies are\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,D}}) = \\frac{1}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 s_{\\mathrm{D}}^{4}}{n_{\\mathrm{D}} - 1}}, \\qquad\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,A}}) = \\frac{1}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 s_{\\mathrm{A}}^{4}}{n_{\\mathrm{A}} - 1}}.\n$$\n\nConsistency assessment:\nWe define a binary consistency flag that checks whether the linear response equal-curvature picture is internally consistent within two standard deviations. Specifically, we test whether\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,D}}| \\le 2 \\sqrt{\\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}})^{2} + \\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,D}})^{2}},\n$$\nand similarly for the acceptor,\n$$\n|\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,A}}| \\le 2 \\sqrt{\\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}})^{2} + \\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,A}})^{2}}.\n$$\nIf both inequalities hold, we set the flag to $1$, otherwise to $0$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- For each test case, read $(T,\\ \\mu_{\\mathrm{D}},\\ \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}},\\ s_{\\mathrm{D}}^{2},\\ s_{\\mathrm{A}}^{2},\\ n_{\\mathrm{D}},\\ n_{\\mathrm{A}})$.\n- Compute $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ using the provided $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ in $\\mathrm{eV/K}$.\n- Compute $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ and $\\Delta G^{0}$ from $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{D}}, \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}})$.\n- Compute $\\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{mean}})$ and $\\mathrm{SE}(\\Delta G^{0})$ from $(s_{\\mathrm{D}}^{2}, s_{\\mathrm{A}}^{2}, n_{\\mathrm{D}}, n_{\\mathrm{A}})$.\n- Compute $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,D}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{var,A}}$ and their standard errors.\n- Compute the consistency flag using the two-standard-deviation criteria above.\n- Round all floating-point outputs to six decimals and emit the final list for each case in the prescribed order.\n\nApplying this to the three provided test cases yields the required outputs. The final program implements these steps exactly and produces a single-line list-of-lists:\n$[[\\lambda_{1},\\ \\Delta G^{0}_{1},\\ \\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{1}),\\ \\mathrm{SE}(\\Delta G^{0}_{1}),\\ \\mathrm{flag}_{1}],\\ [\\lambda_{2},\\ \\Delta G^{0}_{2},\\ \\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{2}),\\ \\mathrm{SE}(\\Delta G^{0}_{2}),\\ \\mathrm{flag}_{2}],\\ [\\lambda_{3},\\ \\Delta G^{0}_{3},\\ \\mathrm{SE}(\\lambda_{3}),\\ \\mathrm{SE}(\\Delta G^{0}_{3}),\\ \\mathrm{flag}_{3}]]$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_case(T, mu_D, mu_A, s2_D, s2_A, n_D, n_A):\n    # Constants\n    kB_eV_per_K = 8.617333262145e-5  # eV/K\n\n    # k_B T in eV\n    kBT = kB_eV_per_K * T\n\n    # Mean-gap estimates\n    lambda_mean = 0.5 * (mu_D - mu_A)\n    dG0 = 0.5 * (mu_D + mu_A)\n\n    # Standard errors for means\n    se_mu_D = np.sqrt(s2_D / n_D)\n    se_mu_A = np.sqrt(s2_A / n_A)\n\n    # Propagate to lambda_mean and dG0\n    se_lambda_mean = 0.5 * np.sqrt(se_mu_D**2 + se_mu_A**2)\n    se_dG0 = 0.5 * np.sqrt(se_mu_D**2 + se_mu_A**2)\n\n    # Variance-based lambda estimates\n    lambda_var_D = s2_D / (2.0 * kBT)\n    lambda_var_A = s2_A / (2.0 * kBT)\n\n    # Standard errors for variance-based lambdas using Var(S^2) = 2 sigma^4/(n-1), plug-in sigma^2 ~ s^2\n    # Guard against n-1 = 0 (though test cases avoid n=1)\n    se_lambda_var_D = (1.0 / (2.0 * kBT)) * np.sqrt(2.0 * (s2_D**2) / (n_D - 1))\n    se_lambda_var_A = (1.0 / (2.0 * kBT)) * np.sqrt(2.0 * (s2_A**2) / (n_A - 1))\n\n    # Consistency checks: within 2 sigma with uncertainties combined in quadrature\n    diff_D = abs(lambda_mean - lambda_var_D)\n    diff_A = abs(lambda_mean - lambda_var_A)\n    thresh_D = 2.0 * np.sqrt(se_lambda_mean**2 + se_lambda_var_D**2)\n    thresh_A = 2.0 * np.sqrt(se_lambda_mean**2 + se_lambda_var_A**2)\n    consistency_flag = int((diff_D = thresh_D) and (diff_A = thresh_A))\n\n    # Round to six decimals as specified\n    def r6(x): return f\"{x:.6f}\"\n\n    return [r6(lambda_mean), r6(dG0), r6(se_lambda_mean), r6(se_dG0), str(consistency_flag)]\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case: (T, mu_D, mu_A, s2_D, s2_A, n_D, n_A)\n    test_cases = [\n        (298.15, 0.600000, -0.200000, 0.0205536, 0.0205536, 200, 200),\n        (310.0, -0.100000, -0.900000, 0.0215000, 0.0212000, 100, 80),\n        (250.0, 0.300000, 0.100000, 0.0040000, 0.0046000, 8, 7),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        T, mu_D, mu_A, s2_D, s2_A, n_D, n_A = case\n        result = compute_case(T, mu_D, mu_A, s2_D, s2_A, n_D, n_A)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Construct the exact required output format: a single line list of lists\n    # Inner lists are comma-separated without quotes around numbers; we already formatted floats as strings.\n    formatted_inner = [f\"[{','.join(items)}]\" for items in results]\n    output_line = f\"[{','.join(formatted_inner)}]\"\n    print(output_line)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2771011"}]}
