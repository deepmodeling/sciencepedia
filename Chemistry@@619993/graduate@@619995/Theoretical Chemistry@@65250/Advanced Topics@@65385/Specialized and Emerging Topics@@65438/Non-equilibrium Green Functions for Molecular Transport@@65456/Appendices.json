The problem specifies the Wide-Band Limit (WBL), which has two consequences:\n$1$. The Lamb shift is zero: $\\Lambda_{\\alpha}(E) = 0$.\n$2$.

Because the lead coupling matrices $\\Gamma_{L}$ and $\\Gamma_{R}$ are diagonal and couple to distinct sites ($1$ and $2$ respectively), the trace simplifies. Let us show this explicitly. The sum is over indices $i,j,k,l$:\n$T(E) = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} (\\Gamma_{L})_{ij} (G^{r})_{jk} (\\Gamma_{R})_{kl} (G^{a})_{li}$.\nWith $(\\Gamma_{L})_{ij} = \\delta_{i1}\\delta_{j1}\\Gamma_{L}$ and $(\\Gamma_{R})_{kl} = \\delta_{k2}\\delta_{l2}\\Gamma_{R}$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nT(E) = \\Gamma_{L}\\Gamma_{R} (G^{r})_{12} (G^{a})_{21}\n$$\nSince $G^{a} = (G^{r})^{\\dagger}$, we have $(G^{a})_{21} = (G^{r}_{12})^{*}$.

The asymmetry enters the expression for $T(E)$ in both the numerator (as the product $\\Gamma_{L}\\Gamma_{R}$) and the denominator. A key insight comes from examining the peak transmission. The denominator is a sum of two squared terms and is always non-negative. For a given total coupling strength $\\Gamma_{tot} = \\Gamma_{L} + \\Gamma_{R}$, the numerator $\\Gamma_{L}\\Gamma_{R}$ is maximized when the coupling is symmetric, i.e., $\\Gamma_{L} = \\Gamma_{R} = \\Gamma_{tot}/2$. Any deviation from this symmetry (asymmetry) while keeping the total coupling fixed will reduce the value of the numerator. A more detailed analysis shows that the prefactor $\\frac{4\\Gamma_{L}\\Gamma_{R}}{(\\Gamma_{L}+\\Gamma_{R})^{2}}$ determines the maximum possible peak height, and this factor is unity only for symmetric coupling and less than unity otherwise. Thus, contact asymmetry acts as an impedance mismatch between the electrodes and the device, which suppresses the overall transmission magnitude compared to a symmetrically coupled junction with the same total broadening.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\Gamma_{L} \\Gamma_{R} t_{c}^{2}}{\\left( E^{2} - t_{c}^{2} - \\frac{\\Gamma_{L} \\Gamma_{R}}{4} \\right)^{2} + \\frac{E^{2}(\\Gamma_{L} + \\Gamma_{R})^{2}}{4}}}\n$$", "id": "2790684"}, {"introduction": "This practice bridges the gap between elegant analytical theory and the practical realities of computational simulation.

Subsequently, a numerical verification must be implemented to demonstrate how this analytical conservation law can be numerically violated.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nWe begin from the fundamental principle of charge conservation. At steady state, the total number of electrons $ \\langle \\hat{N} \\rangle $ in the central molecular region is constant. The time evolution of $ \\langle \\hat{N} \\rangle $ is governed by the sum of currents flowing into the molecule from each electrode, indexed by $ \\alpha \\in \\{L, R\\} $. Thus, the continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\langle \\hat{N} \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{1}{e}\\left(I_L + I_R\\right) = 0 $$\nThis implies that analytically, $ I_L + I_R = 0 $, where $ I_{\\alpha} $ is the electrical current flowing from lead $ \\alpha $ into the molecule.\n\nTo derive expressions for $ I_L $ and $ I_R $, we use the Meir-Wingreen formula, a cornerstone of NEGF transport theory, which expresses the current from lead $ \\alpha $ as:\n$$ I_{\\alpha} = \\frac{ie}{\\hbar} \\int \\frac{dE}{2\\pi} \\text{Tr} \\left\\{ \\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) \\left[ f_{\\alpha}(E) \\left( G^r(E) - G^a(E) \\right) + G^(E) \\right] \\right\\} $$\nFor a single-level system, the trace becomes a scalar product, and using $ h = 2\\pi\\hbar $:\n$$ I_{\\alpha} = \\frac{ie}{h} \\int dE \\, \\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) \\left[ f_{\\alpha}(E) \\left( G^r(E) - G^a(E) \\right) + G^(E) \\right] $$\nWe require expressions for the Green's functions. The problem statement provides the relation for the spectral function $ A(E) = i\\left(G^r(E) - G^a(E)\\right) $, which means $ G^r(E) - G^a(E) = -iA(E) $.\n\nThe lesser Green's function $ G^(E) $ is determined by the lesser self-energy $ \\Sigma^(E) $ via the Keldysh equation:\n$$ G^(E) = G^r(E) \\Sigma^(E) G^a(E) $$\nThe total lesser self-energy is the sum of contributions from the leads, $ \\Sigma^(E) = \\Sigma_L^(E) + \\Sigma_R^(E) $. Each contribution is given by $ \\Sigma_{\\alpha}^(E) = i f_{\\alpha}(E) \\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) $, where $ f_{\\alpha}(E) $ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution of lead $ \\alpha $. For a single-level device, $ G^r(E)G^a(E) = |G^r(E)|^2 $, so we have:\n$$ G^(E) = i |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L(E)\\Gamma_L(E) + f_R(E)\\Gamma_R(E) \\right) $$\nSubstituting these relations into the Meir-Wingreen formula for $ I_{\\alpha} $, we obtain:\n$$ I_{\\alpha} = \\frac{ie}{h} \\int dE \\, \\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) \\left[ f_{\\alpha}(E) (-iA(E)) + i |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L(E)\\Gamma_L(E) + f_R(E)\\Gamma_R(E) \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ I_{\\alpha} = \\frac{e}{h} \\int dE \\, \\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) \\left[ f_{\\alpha}(E) A(E) - |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L(E)\\Gamma_L(E) + f_R(E)\\Gamma_R(E) \\right) \\right] $$\nThis gives distinct expressions for the current from each lead. The first term, $ \\propto f_{\\alpha} A $, represents the rate of electrons tunneling *from* lead $ \\alpha $ into the available states $ A(E) $ on the molecule. The second term, proportional to $ G^(E)/i $, represents the rate of electrons tunneling *out of* the occupied molecular states into lead $ \\alpha $.\n\nLet us denote the integrands for $ I_L $ and $ I_R $ by $ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) $ and $ \\mathcal{J}_R(E) $, respectively:\n$$ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) = \\Gamma_L(E) \\left[ f_L(E) A(E) - |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L\\Gamma_L + f_R\\Gamma_R \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\mathcal{J}_R(E) = \\Gamma_R(E) \\left[ f_R(E) A(E) - |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L\\Gamma_L + f_R\\Gamma_R \\right) \\right] $$\nTo prove that $ I_L + I_R = 0 $, we show that their integrands sum to zero at every energy $ E $.\n$$ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) + \\mathcal{J}_R(E) = A(E) \\left( f_L\\Gamma_L + f_R\\Gamma_R \\right) - \\left( \\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R \\right) |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L\\Gamma_L + f_R\\Gamma_R \\right) $$\nUsing the problem's provided relation $ A(E) = |G^r(E)|^2 (\\Gamma_L(E) + \\Gamma_R(E)) = |G^r(E)|^2 \\Gamma_{tot}(E) $, we substitute this into the first term:\n$$ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) + \\mathcal{J}_R(E) = |G^r(E)|^2 \\Gamma_{tot}(E) \\left( f_L\\Gamma_L + f_R\\Gamma_R \\right) - \\Gamma_{tot}(E) |G^r(E)|^2 \\left( f_L\\Gamma_L + f_R\\Gamma_R \\right) = 0 $$\nSince the sum of the integrands is identically zero for all $ E $, the sum of the integrals must also be zero:\n$$ I_L + I_R = \\frac{e}{h} \\int dE \\left( \\mathcal{J}_L(E) + \\mathcal{J}_R(E) \\right) = \\int 0 \\, dE = 0 $$\nThis completes the analytical proof based on the provided first principles.\n\n### Numerical Implementation\n\nThe numerical task is to calculate $ I_L $ and $ I_R $ by integrating the respective integrands $ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) $ and $ \\mathcal{J}_R(E) $ over a finite energy grid and compute the residual sum $ I_L + I_R $.\nAnalytically, $ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) + \\mathcal{J}_R(E) = 0 $. If we use the same linear quadrature operator $ Q(\\cdot) $ (e.g., trapezoidal rule) for both integrals, the numerical sum will also be zero up to machine precision, because linearity implies $ Q(\\mathcal{J}_L) + Q(\\mathcal{J}_R) = Q(\\mathcal{J}_L + \\mathcal{J}_R) = Q(0) = 0 $.\nHowever, the problem instructs us to use potentially *different* quadrature rules, $ Q_L $ and $ Q_R $, for each integral. In this case, the computed sum is $ Q_L(\\mathcal{J}_L) + Q_R(\\mathcal{J}_R) $. There is no mathematical guarantee that this sum will be zero. The resulting non-zero residual is a numerical artifact stemming from the different discretization errors of the two quadrature rules, not a violation of physical law.\n\nThe implementation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Constants and Units**: Physical constants ($ e $, $ h $, $ k_B $) are defined in SI units. All input parameters given in electronvolts ($eV$) are converted to Joules ($J$) by multiplying by $ e $.\n2.  **Energy Grid**: A uniform energy grid $ E $ is created from $ E_{\\min} $ to $ E_{\\max} $ with $ N $ points.\n3.  **Functions**: For a given energy grid, we compute arrays for:\n    -   Coupling functions: $ \\Gamma_L(E) $ (Gaussian) and $ \\Gamma_R(E) $ (Lorentzian).\n    -   Fermi-Dirac distributions: $ f_L(E) $ and $ f_R(E) $ with chemical potentials $ \\mu_L = E_F + eV/2 $ and $ \\mu_R = E_F - eV/2 $.\n    -   Total broadening: $ \\Gamma_{tot}(E) = \\Gamma_L(E) + \\Gamma_R(E) $.\n    -   Retarded Green's function for a single level $ \\varepsilon_0 $: $ G^r(E) = [E - \\varepsilon_0 + i\\Gamma_{tot}(E)/2]^{-1} $.\n    -   Spectral function: $ A(E) = |G^r(E)|^2 \\Gamma_{tot}(E) $.\n    -   Lesser Green's function term: $ G^(E)/i = |G^r(E)|^2 (f_L(E)\\Gamma_L(E) + f_R(E)\\Gamma_R(E)) $.\n4.  **Integrands**: The integrands $ \\mathcal{J}_L(E) $ and $ \\mathcal{J}_R(E) $ are constructed as arrays over the energy grid.\n5.  **Quadrature**:\n    -   **Trapezoidal Rule**: Implemented using `numpy.trapz`, which computes the integral of a function given samples on a grid.\n    -   **Midpoint Rule**: Implemented by evaluating the integrand on a new grid of midpoints between the original grid points, then summing these values and multiplying by the energy step $ \\Delta E $.\n6.  **Current Calculation**: The currents $ I_L $ and $ I_R $ are computed by applying the specified quadrature rule to their respective integrands and multiplying by the prefactor $ e/h $. The residual $ I_L + I_R $ is then reported.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the five test cases, which are designed to explore how grid density, integration window, and choice of quadrature rule affect the numerical conservation of current.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants in SI units\nE_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge in Coulombs\nH_PLANCK = 6.62607015e-34    # Planck's constant in J*s\nKB_BOLTZMANN = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann's constant in J/K\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main solver function to process test cases and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: dense grid, consistent quadrature\n        {\n            'params': {'eps0': 0.1, 'ef': 0.0, 'T': 300, 'V': 0.1},\n            'gamma_L': {'G0': 0.2, 'Ec': 0.0, 'sigma': 0.5, 'bg': 0.02},\n            'gamma_R': {'G0': 0.15, 'Ec': 0.05, 'gamma': 0.3, 'bg': 0.02},\n            'grid': {'Emin': -5.0, 'Emax': 5.0, 'N': 20001},\n            'quad': {'L': 'trapezoidal', 'R': 'trapezoidal'}\n        },\n        # Case 2: dense grid, inconsistent quadrature\n        {\n            'params': {'eps0': -0.2, 'ef': 0.0, 'T': 300, 'V': 1.0},\n            'gamma_L': {'G0': 0.3, 'Ec': -0.1, 'sigma': 0.4, 'bg': 0.01},\n            'gamma_R': {'G0': 0.05, 'Ec': 0.2, 'gamma': 0.2, 'bg': 0.01},\n            'grid': {'Emin': -6.0, 'Emax': 6.0, 'N': 20001},\n            'quad': {'L': 'trapezoidal', 'R': 'midpoint'}\n        },\n        # Case 3: coarse grid, inconsistent quadrature\n        {\n            'params': {'eps0': 0.0, 'ef': 0.0, 'T': 300, 'V': 0.2},\n            'gamma_L': {'G0': 0.15, 'Ec': 0.0, 'sigma': 0.2, 'bg': 0.005},\n            'gamma_R': {'G0': 0.15, 'Ec': 0.0, 'gamma': 0.25, 'bg': 0.005},\n            'grid': {'Emin': -2.0, 'Emax': 2.0, 'N': 401},\n            'quad': {'L': 'trapezoidal', 'R': 'midpoint'}\n        },\n        # Case 4: truncated window, inconsistent quadrature\n        {\n            'params': {'eps0': 0.0, 'ef': 0.0, 'T': 50, 'V': 2.0},\n            'gamma_L': {'G0': 0.2, 'Ec': 0.0, 'sigma': 0.3, 'bg': 0.01},\n            'gamma_R': {'G0': 0.2, 'Ec': 0.0, 'gamma': 0.3, 'bg': 0.01},\n            'grid': {'Emin': -1.0, 'Emax': 1.0, 'N': 2001},\n            'quad': {'L': 'trapezoidal', 'R': 'midpoint'}\n        },\n        # Case 5: sharp Fermi edges, very dense grid, consistent quadrature\n        {\n            'params': {'eps0': 0.05, 'ef': 0.0, 'T': 1, 'V': 0.05},\n            'gamma_L': {'G0': 0.1, 'Ec': 0.0, 'sigma': 0.25, 'bg': 0.005},\n            'gamma_R': {'G0': 0.1, 'Ec': 0.0, 'gamma': 0.25, 'bg': 0.005},\n            'grid': {'Emin': -2.0, 'Emax': 2.0, 'N': 40001},\n            'quad': {'L': 'trapezoidal', 'R': 'trapezoidal'}\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        residual = calculate_residual(case)\n        results.append(f\"{residual:.6e}\")\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef calculate_residual(case):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the residual current I_L + I_R for a given test case.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters and convert units from eV to Joules\n    p = {k: v * E_CHARGE for k, v in case['params'].items() if k not in ['T']}\n    p['T'] = case['params']['T']\n    \n    gl_p = {k: v * E_CHARGE for k, v in case['gamma_L'].items()}\n    gr_p = {k: v * E_CHARGE for k, v in case['gamma_R'].items()}\n\n    grid_p = {k: v for k, v in case['grid'].items()}\n    grid_p['Emin'] *= E_CHARGE\n    grid_p['Emax'] *= E_CHARGE\n    \n    # Define electrochemical potentials in Joules\n    mu_L = p['ef'] + p['V'] / 2\n    mu_R = p['ef'] -
