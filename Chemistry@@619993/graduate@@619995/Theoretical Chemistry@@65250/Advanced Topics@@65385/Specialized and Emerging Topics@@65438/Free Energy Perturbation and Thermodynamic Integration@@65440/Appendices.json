We will derive this quantity through three distinct methods as requested.\n\n(a) Exact configurational Helmholtz free energy $A_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T)$\n\nThe configurational partition function $Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}$ for a system with potential energy $U(x;k)$ at temperature $T$ is given by\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U(x;k)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$.

First, we compute the partial derivative of $U_{\\lambda}(x)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}k(\\lambda)}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) x^{2}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the ensemble average of this quantity, $\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\rangle_{\\lambda}$, in the canonical ensemble defined by the potential $U_{\\lambda}(x)$:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) x^{2} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) \\langle x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\langle x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda}$ is the mean-squared displacement of the oscillator with force constant $k(\\lambda)$. For a classical one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the equipartition theorem states that the average potential energy is $\\langle \\frac{1}{2}k(\\lambda)x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{B}T$. From this, we directly find the mean-squared displacement:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2} \\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{k(\\lambda)} = \\frac{1}{\\beta k(\\lambda)}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for the ensemble average derivative gives\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}(x)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{1} - k_{0}) \\frac{1}{\\beta k(\\lambda)} = \\frac{k_{1} - k_{0}}{2\\beta((1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1})}\n$$\nNow we can perform the integration over $\\lambda$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{k_{1} - k_{0}}{2\\beta((1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1})} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\lambda\n$$\nLet the denominator be $f(\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda)k_{0} + \\lambda k_{1} = k_{0} + \\lambda(k_{1}-k_{0})$.

Choosing the initial state with force constant $k_{0}$ as the reference, the formula is\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_{1} - A_{0} = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln \\left\\langle \\exp\\left(-\\beta (U_{1}(x) - U_{0}(x))\\right) \\right\\rangle_{0}\n$$\nHere, $U_{0}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{0}x^{2}$, $U_{1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}k_{1}x^{2}$, and $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_{0}$ denotes an ensemble average over the reference state $0$. The potential energy difference is $\\Delta U(x) = U_{1}(x) - U_{0}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(k_{1}-k_{0})x^{2}$.\n\nThe ensemble average is computed as\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U(x)) \\right\\rangle_{0} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U(x)) \\exp(-\\beta U_{0}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U_{0}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential in the numerator's integrand is\n$$\n-\\beta \\Delta U(x) - \\beta U_{0}(x) = -\\beta \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(k_{1}-k_{0})x^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}k_{0}x^{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\beta k_{1}x^{2} = -\\beta U_1(x)\n$$\nThus, the ensemble average is the ratio of two partition functions:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U(x)) \\right\\rangle_{0} = \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U_{1}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta U_{0}(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_1, T)}{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_0, T)}\n$$\nUsing the result for $Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}$ from part (a), $Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k,T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k}}$, we have\n$$\n\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_1, T)}{Z_{\\mathrm{conf}}(k_0, T)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k_{1}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta k_{0}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the FEP formula for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{1}}{k_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nAll three methods—direct calculation from the definition of $A$, thermodynamic integration, and free energy perturbation—yield the identical result, as required by consistency.

Further, an explanation of the regime of validity for this expression is demanded.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental definitions provided. The Helmholtz free energy of a state $i$ is given by $A_{i} = -k_{B}T \\ln Z_{i}$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Z_{i}$ is the canonical partition function for state $i$.

For a Gaussian-distributed random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$, the MGF is a standard result from probability theory:\n$$\nM_{X}(t) = \\exp\\left(\\mu t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}t^{2}\\right)\n$$\nApplying this to our variable $\\Delta U$ and evaluating at $t = -\\beta$:\n$$\n\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U) \\rangle_{0} = M_{\\Delta U}(-\\beta) = \\exp\\left(\\mu(-\\beta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}(-\\beta)^{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\beta\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute this back into the expression for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = -k_{B}T \\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\beta\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe logarithm and the exponential are inverse functions, which simplifies the expression to:\n$$\n\\Delta A = -k_{B}T \\left(-\\beta\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta^{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = -k_{B}T \\left(-\\frac{\\mu}{k_{B}T} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{(k_{B}T)^{2}}\\right) = \\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the free energy difference under the given Gaussian assumption.\n\nThe regime of validity of this expression must be considered from two perspectives: formal and practical.\n\nFormally, the derivation $\\Delta A = \\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2k_{B}T}$ is an exact identity contingent entirely on the premise that the distribution of $\\Delta U$ under $\\pi_{0}$ is perfectly Gaussian. This is because the free energy difference can be expressed as a cumulant expansion:\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-\\beta)^{n-1}}{n!} C_{n} = C_{1} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}C_{2} + \\frac{\\beta^{2}}{6}C_{3} - \\dots\n$$\nwhere $C_{n}$ is the $n$-th cumulant of the $\\Delta U$ distribution. For any distribution, $C_{1} = \\mu$ and $C_{2} = \\sigma^{2}$. A defining property of the Gaussian distribution is that all cumulants of order $n > 2$ are identically zero ($C_{3}=C_{4}=\\dots=0$). Thus, for a perfect Gaussian, the cumulant series truncates exactly after the second term, yielding our derived result.\n\nPractically, the distribution of $\\Delta U$ in a real physical system is rarely, if ever, perfectly Gaussian. The validity of the expression as an approximation hinges on several factors:\n$1$. Distributional Shape: The approximation is accurate only when the true distribution of $\\Delta U$ is close to Gaussian. This is more likely to occur in large, complex systems where the total energy difference $\\Delta U$ arises from the sum of many small, weakly correlated contributions, invoking a central-limit-theorem-like behavior. The approximation will fail if $\\Delta U$ is dominated by a few strong, specific interactions (e.g., the formation or rupture of a single covalent bond or a critical hydrogen bond), which can lead to highly skewed or even bimodal distributions. In terms of cumulants, this means the approximation is valid when higher-order cumulants, such as skewness ($C_{3}$) and excess kurtosis ($C_{4}$), are negligible compared to $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^{2}$.\n$2$. State Overlap: The variance $\\sigma^{2}$ serves as a measure of the \"distance\" or lack of overlap between the potential energy landscapes of states $0$ and $1$. A small variance (e.g., $\\sigma \\lesssim k_{B}T$) implies good overlap, meaning the important configurations of state $1$ are reasonably well sampled in the ensemble of state $0$. In this case, the $\\Delta U$ distribution is narrow and more likely to be symmetric and well-behaved, making the Gaussian approximation more robust. Conversely, a large variance ($\\sigma \\gg k_{B}T$) signifies poor overlap, where the $\\Delta U$ distribution is broad. In such cases, the distribution is more prone to non-Gaussian features (e.g., heavy tails), and the second-order approximation breaks down.\n$3$. Sampling Reliability: While the calculation of $\\mu = \\langle \\Delta U \\rangle_{0}$ and $\\sigma^{2} = \\langle (\\Delta U - \\mu)^{2} \\rangle_{0}$ is typically much more statistically stable than the direct calculation of $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta U) \\rangle_{0}$ (which is highly sensitive to rare events in the tails), the accuracy of the final result still depends on obtaining converged estimates of these first two moments. Any practical calculation, such as a molecular dynamics simulation, must be long enough to adequately sample the phase space of state $0$ to ensure the calculated $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ are representative of the true equilibrium values. Insufficient sampling will lead to biased moments and an inaccurate $\\Delta A$.\n\nIn summary, the expression is formally exact for a Gaussian energy difference distribution. In practice, it is a useful approximation when the states are sufficiently similar (small $\\sigma^{2}$), when the system is complex enough for the central limit theorem to hold approximately, and when computational sampling is sufficient to converge the mean and variance of the energy difference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2k_{B}T}}$$", "id": "2642298"}, {"introduction": "Moving from analytical theory to computational practice reveals that free energy calculations are fundamentally data analysis problems.

The formula for the composite Simpson's rule for $N$ intervals (where $N$ is even) is:\n$$ I_S = \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ f_0 + 4\\sum_{i=1, i \\text{ odd}}^{N-1} f_i + 2\\sum_{i=2, i \\text{ even}}^{N-2} f_i + f_N \\right] $$\nHere, $N=10$, $h=0.1$, and $f_i$ are the provided mean values of the integrand at $\\lambda_i$.\nThe values are $f_0 = 4.000$, $f_1 = 4.472$, $f_2 = 4.896$, $f_3 = 5.284$, $f_4 = 5.648$, $f_5 = 6.000$, $f_6 = 6.352$, $f_7 = 6.716$, $f_8 = 7.104$, $f_9 = 7.528$, and $f_{10} = 8.000$, all in units of $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nWe calculate the weighted sum:\nSum of odd-indexed terms: $f_1 + f_3 + f_5 + f_7 + f_9 = 4.472 + 5.284 + 6.000 + 6.716 + 7.528 = 30.000$.\nSum of even-indexed terms (excluding endpoints): $f_2 + f_4 + f_6 + f_8 = 4.896 + 5.648 + 6.352 + 7.104 = 24.000$.\nThe total expression within the brackets is:\n$$ [f_0 + f_{10} + 4(30.000) + 2(24.000)] = [4.000 + 8.000 + 120.000 + 48.000] = 180.000 $$\nThus, the estimate for the free energy difference is:\n$$ \\Delta F \\approx \\frac{0.1}{3} (180.000) = 6.000~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nIt is noteworthy that the provided data points perfectly fit the cubic polynomial $f(\\lambda) = 2(\\lambda-0.5)^3 + 3.5(\\lambda-0.5) + 6$. As Simpson's rule is exact for polynomials of degree up to $3$, our numerical estimate of $\\Delta F = 6.000~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ is, in fact, the exact integral of this underlying function.\n\nNext, we evaluate the uncertainty of this estimate. The total uncertainty arises from two independent sources: the statistical sampling uncertainty from the simulations at each $\\lambda_i$, and the systematic truncation uncertainty of the numerical quadrature rule.\n\n1.  **Sampling Uncertainty ($\\sigma_{\\text{samp}}$)**\n    The estimate of $\\Delta F$ is a linear combination of the measured mean values $f_i$, i.e., $\\Delta F = \\sum_{i=0}^{10} w_i f_i$, where $w_i$ are the Simpson's rule weights. Since the estimates at different $\\lambda_i$ are statistically independent, the variance of $\\Delta F$ is the weighted sum of the individual variances $\\sigma_i^2$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\text{samp}}^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{10} w_i^2 \\sigma_i^2 = \\left(\\frac{h}{3}\\right)^2 \\left[ 1^2\\sigma_0^2 + 4^2\\sigma_1^2 + 2^2\\sigma_2^2 + \\dots + 4^2\\sigma_9^2 + 1^2\\sigma_{10}^2 \\right] $$\n    The standard errors $\\sigma_i$ are: $\\sigma_0=0.080$, $\\sigma_1=0.090$, $\\sigma_2=0.080$, $\\sigma_3=0.070$, $\\sigma_4=0.060$, $\\sigma_5=0.050$, $\\sigma_6=0.060$, $\\sigma_7=0.070$, $\\sigma_8=0.080$, $\\sigma_9=0.090$, and $\\sigma_{10}=0.100$.\n    The weighted sum of variances is:\n    $$ \\sum w_i^2 \\sigma_i^2 / (h/3)^2 = 1^2(0.080)^2 + 16(0.090)^2 + 4(0.080)^2 + 16(0.070)^2 + 4(0.060)^2 + 16(0.050)^2 + 4(0.060)^2 + 16(0.070)^2 + 4(0.080)^2 + 16(0.090)^2 + 1^2(0.100)^2 $$\n    $$ = 0.0064 + 0.1296 + 0.0256 + 0.0784 + 0.0144 + 0.0400 + 0.0144 + 0.0784 + 0.0256 + 0.1296 + 0.0100 = 0.5524 $$\n    The variance due to sampling is:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\text{samp}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.1}{3}\\right)^2 (0.5524) = \\frac{0.01}{9} \\times 0.5524 \\approx 0.00061378 $$\n    The standard uncertainty from sampling is:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\text{samp}} = \\sqrt{0.00061378} \\approx 0.02477~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n\n2.  **Truncation Uncertainty ($u_{\\text{trunc}}$)**\n    The truncation error $E_S$ of the composite Simpson's rule is bounded by:\n    $$ |E_S| \\le \\frac{b-a}{180} h^4 \\max_{\\lambda \\in [a,b]} |f^{(4)}(\\lambda)| $$\n    Given $a=0$, $b=1$, $h=0.1$, and the bound $\\max |f^{(4)}(\\lambda)| \\leq M_4 = 1200~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, the maximum absolute error is:\n    $$ |E_S|_{\\max} = \\frac{1-0}{180} (0.1)^4 (1200) = \\frac{0.0001 \\times 1200}{180} = \\frac{0.12}{180} = \\frac{1}{1500} \\approx 0.000667~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n    The problem instructs to model this error as a rectangular (uniform) distribution over the interval $[-|E_S|_{\\max}, +|E_S|_{\\max}]$. The standard deviation of a uniform distribution on $[-c, c]$ is $c/\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the standard uncertainty from truncation is:\n    $$ u_{\\text{trunc}} = \\frac{|E_S|_{\\max}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{1500\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.000385~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n    This uncertainty is an estimate based on the provided conservative bound, despite the analytic function being cubic (implying zero truncation error). We follow the problem specification.\n\n3.  **Combined Standard Uncertainty ($u_c$)**\n    Assuming the sampling and truncation errors are independent, their standard uncertainties are combined in quadrature:\n    $$ u_c^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{samp}}^2 + u_{\\text{trunc}}^2 = 0.00061378 + \\left(\\frac{1}{1500\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.00061378 + 0.000000148 = 0.00061393 $$\n    $$ u_c = \\sqrt{0.00061393} \\approx 0.02478~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\n    The contribution from truncation uncertainty is negligible compared to the sampling uncertainty. Reporting the final uncertainty to two significant figures gives $u_c \\approx 0.025~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n    The final free energy difference is $\\Delta F = 6.000 \\pm 0.025~\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The central value rounded to four significant figures is $6.000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.000}\n$$", "id": "2774300"}]}
