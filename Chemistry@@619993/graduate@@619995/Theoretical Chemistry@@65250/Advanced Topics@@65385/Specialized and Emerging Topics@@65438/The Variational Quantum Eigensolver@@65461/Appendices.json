The concepts of Pauli strings, measurement settings, and qubit-wise commuting groups for measurement reduction are fundamental and factually correct within quantum information theory.\n- **Well-Posed:** The Hamiltonian is clearly defined. The rules for counting measurement settings for both parts of the problem are explicit and unambiguous. The problem is structured to yield a unique numerical answer for each part.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum number of measurement settings required to estimate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian $H = c_0\\, I + c_1\\, Z_0 + c_2\\, Z_1 + c_3\\, Z_0 Z_1$. The expectation value is given by $\\langle H \\rangle = c_0 \\langle I \\rangle + c_1 \\langle Z_0 \\rangle + c_2 \\langle Z_1 \\rangle + c_3 \\langle Z_0 Z_1 \\rangle$.\n\nAs stated in the problem, the identity term $c_0 I$ contributes a constant value $c_0$ to the energy, since $\\langle I \\rangle = 1$ for any state. This term requires no experimental measurement. We must therefore consider only the non-identity Pauli strings in the Hamiltonian, which are:\n- $P^{(1)} = Z_0 = Z \\otimes I$\n- $P^{(2)} = Z_1 = I \\otimes Z$\n- $P^{(3)} = Z_0 Z_1 = Z \\otimes Z$\n\nThere are $3$ such non-identity terms.\n\n**Part 1: No Grouping ($N_{\\text{no group}}$)**\nIn this scenario, each non-identity Pauli term's expectation value is estimated in a dedicated experiment. This means that data from one experiment cannot be reused to estimate the expectation value of another term.\nThe terms to be measured are $\\langle Z_0 \\rangle$, $\\langle Z_1 \\rangle$, and $\\langle Z_0 Z_1 \\rangle$.\nAccording to the problem's explicit rule for this part, we require:\n- One experiment (setting) to measure $\\langle Z_0 \\rangle$.\n- One experiment (setting) to measure $\\langle Z_1 \\rangle$.\n- One experiment (setting) to measure $\\langle Z_0 Z_1 \\rangle$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of required measurement settings is the count of the non-identity Pauli terms.\n$$\nN_{\\text{no group}} = 3\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Grouping under Qubit-Wise Commuting (QWC) Compatibility ($N_{\\text{QWC group}}$)**\nIn this scenario, we group Pauli strings that are qubit-wise commuting. Two Pauli strings $P = \\bigotimes_{i=0}^{n-1} P_i$ and $Q = \\bigotimes_{i=0}^{n-1} Q_i$ are qubit-wise commuting if $[P_i, Q_i] = 0$ for all qubit indices $i$, where $[A,B]=AB-BA$ is the commutator. For Pauli matrices, this condition simplifies to $P_i$ and $Q_i$ being the same operator or one of them being the identity $I$.\n\nLet us examine the set of non-identity Pauli strings: $\\{P^{(1)}, P^{(2)}, P^{(3)}\\} = \\{Z \\otimes I, I \\otimes Z, Z \\otimes Z\\}$.\nWe check the qubit-wise commutativity for the entire set by inspecting the Pauli operators at each qubit position.\n\n- For qubit $0$ (the first qubit), the operators are $\\{Z, I, Z\\}$. The Pauli operators in this set are either $I$ or $Z$. Since $[Z, I] = 0$ and $[Z, Z] = 0$, all operators at this position commute with each other.\n\n- For qubit $1$ (the second qubit), the operators are $\\{I, Z, Z\\}$. Similarly, the Pauli operators in this set are either $I$ or $Z$. Since $[I, Z] = 0$ and $[Z, Z] = 0$, all operators at this position also commute with each other.\n\nSince the operators commute on a per-qubit basis for all pairs of strings in the set $\\{P^{(1)}, P^{(2)}, P^{(3)}\\}$, the entire set is mutually qubit-wise commuting. Consequently, all three Pauli strings can be measured simultaneously in a single measurement group.\n\nThis single group requires a measurement setting that is compatible with all member strings. To measure a Pauli string containing a non-identity operator $P_i \\in \\{X, Y, Z\\}$ on qubit $i$, one must measure qubit $i$ in the eigenbasis of $P_i$.\n- To measure $P^{(1)} = Z \\otimes I$, we must measure qubit $0$ in the $Z$-basis.\n- To measure $P^{(2)} = I \\otimes Z$, we must measure qubit $1$ in the $Z$-basis.\n- To measure $P^{(3)} = Z \\otimes Z$, we must measure qubit $0$ in the $Z$-basis and qubit $1$ in the $Z$-basis.\n\nAll three requirements are satisfied by a single measurement setting: measuring both qubit $0$ and qubit $1$ in the $Z$-basis. This corresponds to the measurement setting defined by the operator $Z \\otimes Z$. By collecting statistics from this single experiment, one can compute all three expectation values $\\langle Z_0 \\rangle$, $\\langle Z_1 \\rangle$, and $\\langle Z_0 Z_1 \\rangle$.\n\nTherefore, only one measurement setting is required when using QWC grouping.\n$$\nN_{\\text{QWC group}} = 1\n$$\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} N_{\\text{no group}} & N_{\\text{QWC group}} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the derived values, we have $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2932509"}, {"introduction": "Even after optimizing the number of measurement settings through grouping, the statistical nature of quantum measurement remains a key challenge.

The constraint is the fixed total number of shots:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_{i} = N_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\nWe employ the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\{N_i\\}, \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{c_{i}^2 \\mathrm{Var}(P_{i})}{N_{i}} - \\lambda \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} N_{i} - N_{\\mathrm{tot}}\\right)\n$$\nTo find the stationary point, we set the partial derivatives of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $N_{k}$ (for $k = 1, \\dots, m$) and $\\lambda$ to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial N_{k}} = -\\frac{c_{k}^2 \\mathrm{Var}(P_{k})}{N_{k}^2} - \\lambda = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} N_{k} - N_{\\mathrm{tot}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFrom the first equation, we solve for $N_k$:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{k}^2 \\mathrm{Var}(P_{k})}{N_{k}^2} = -\\lambda\n$$\nSince $N_{k}^2 > 0$, $c_k^2 \\ge 0$, and $\\mathrm{Var}(P_k) \\ge 0$, it must be that $\\lambda \\le 0$.

Because each $P_i$ is a Pauli string, its constituent operators (Pauli matrices) square to the identity matrix. Consequently, $P_i^2 = I$, the identity operator. This implies $\\langle P_i^2 \\rangle = \\langle I \\rangle = 1$. The true variance is therefore $\\mathrm{Var}(P_i) = 1 - \\langle P_i \\rangle^2$. To estimate this quantity, we only need an estimate of the mean, $\\langle P_i \\rangle$.\n\nLet the sequence of $k$ measurement outcomes for $P_i$ be $o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_k$, where each $o_j \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$. The sample mean after $k$ measurements is $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k} = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^{k} o_j$. This sample mean can be updated recursively as new outcomes arrive without storing the entire history. If $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k}$ is the mean after $k$ outcomes, and a new outcome $o_{k+1}$ is measured, the new mean $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k+1}$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k+1} = \\frac{k\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k} + o_{k+1}}{k+1} = \\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k} + \\frac{o_{k+1} - \\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k}}{k+1}\n$$\nThis update rule requires storing only the current mean $\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k}$ and the number of measurements $k$. At each step of the iterative VQE run, one can update the estimate of the mean for each $P_i$ using this formula. The variance is then estimated simply as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(P_i) = 1 - (\\widehat{\\mu}_{i,k+1})^2$. These updated variance estimates are then used in the formula for $N_{i}^{\\star}$ to adaptively re-allocate the shot budget for the next VQE iteration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{N_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{|c_i| \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(P_i)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m} |c_j| \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(P_j)}}}$$", "id": "2932482"}, {"introduction": "The heart of the VQE algorithm is the classical optimization loop that adjusts the ansatz parameters to find the ground state energy.

In the computational basis $\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}$, its matrix representation is:\n$$\nG_{pq} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(G_{pq} - \\lambda I) = \\lambda^2(\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0$. The eigenvalues are therefore $\\{0, 0, 1, -1\\}$. The set of distinct eigenvalues is $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Since there are three distinct eigenvalues, the 2-point parameter-shift rule does not apply.\n\n- **Untrotterized double-excitation gate, $U_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\theta) = \\exp(-i \\theta G_{pq}^{rs})$**: The generator $G_{pq}^{rs}$ is derived from the fermionic double-excitation operator $a_{p}^{\\dagger} a_{q}^{\\dagger} a_{s} a_{r} - \\text{h.c.}$ followed by a fermion-to-qubit mapping like Jordan–Wigner. A single such term maps to a linear combination of multiple non-commuting Pauli words with real coefficients. A generic linear combination of non-commuting operators does not have a simple spectrum with only two eigenvalues. Therefore, the 2-point parameter-shift rule is generally not applicable for these gates.\n\n- **First-order Trotter product, $U_{\\mathrm{Trot}}(\\theta) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} \\exp(-i \\theta c_k P_k)$**: This unitary is a product of exponentials where the parameter $\\theta$ is coupled to each exponent. This is not of the form $\\exp(-i\\theta G)$ for a single, simple generator $G$. The derivative must be computed using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{Trot}}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{j-1} e^{-i\\theta c_k P_k} \\right) \\left( -i c_j P_j e^{-i\\theta c_j P_j} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k=j+1}^{K} e^{-i\\theta c_k P_k} \\right)\n$$\nThis leads to a gradient of the form $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\theta} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} c_k \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\phi_k}\\big|_{\\phi_k=\\theta c_k}$, where $\\phi_k$ is the parameter of the $k$-th gate in the product. Each term $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\phi_k}$ corresponds to a gate with generator $P_k$, for which the 2-point parameter-shift rule applies. Thus, the total gradient is exact and can be computed as a sum of $K$ terms, each obtained via a 2-point shift. The total number of circuit evaluations would be $2K$.\n\nWe now proceed to evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A**:\nThe statement claims that the generator $G_{pq}$ for the exchange gate $U_{\\mathrm{ex}}(\\theta)$ has more than $2$ distinct eigenvalues, thus invalidating the 2-point parameter-shift rule. Our analysis showed that the distinct eigenvalues are $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which confirms this claim. The statement then proposes that unbiased gradients can be obtained via a generalized multi-point parameter-shift rule (an LCU method) or via an ancilla-assisted interference circuit. Both are valid and standard advanced techniques for computing gradients when the 2-point rule does not apply.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B**:\nThe statement claims that a single Pauli rotation $U_P(\\theta)$ does not admit a 2-point parameter-shift rule. This is fundamentally incorrect. The generator is a Pauli word $P$ with eigenvalues $\\{-1, 1\\}$, which is the canonical case where the 2-point rule is applicable. The premise of the statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C**:\nThe statement asserts that the generator $G_{pq}^{rs}$ of the untrotterized double-excitation gate $U_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\theta)$ is a sum of noncommuting Pauli words and thus does not admit a 2-point parameter-shift rule. This is correct, as such generators typically have complex spectra with more than two distinct eigenvalues. The statement then proposes two valid methods for obtaining unbiased gradients: a generalized parameter-shift rule (an LCU estimator based on the generator's spectrum) and an ancilla-assisted Hadamard-test construction. The latter is a general method for measuring commutators or implementing LCU, and is indeed a valid strategy. Both proposed solutions are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option D**:\nThis statement claims that for a Trotter product $U_{\\mathrm{Trot}}(\\theta)$, the 2-point parameter-shift property is violated and \"exact parameter-shift gradients are impossible\". While the composite gate itself does not satisfy the condition for a single 2-point shift rule, the conclusion that exact gradients are impossible is false. As shown in our analysis, the exact gradient can be computed by applying the product rule and evaluating each of the $K$ resulting terms using the 2-point parameter-shift rule, since each component gate is a simple Pauli rotation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E**:\nThe statement claims that adding a control ancilla to a gate $U_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\theta)$ makes the 2-point parameter-shift rule applicable. This is a misunderstanding of the role of ancilla qubits in gradient computation. Ancilla-based methods provide an alternative measurement scheme to *calculate* the gradient, essentially by constructing a circuit that estimates the necessary commutator. They do not alter the spectral properties of the original generator $G_{pq}^{rs}$. The applicability of the parameter-shift rule is an intrinsic property of the generator of the parameterized gate, not a feature that can be induced by an external measurement circuit.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nTherefore, statements A and C are the only correct descriptions of the situation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2932516"}]}
