The string method in collective variables is a standard and widely used algorithm for finding minimum energy or free energy paths for transitions, such as chemical reactions or conformational changes.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in theoretical chemistry that admits a rigorous analytical solution. I will now proceed to derive this solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution will be derived in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1) Identification of Stationary Points\n\nStationary points of the free energy surface $F(\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$ are points where the gradient vanishes, i.e., $\\nabla F = \\vec{0}$. The gradient is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla F(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\xi_1}, \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\xi_2} \\right) = (4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1, 2\\lambda\\xi_2)\n$$\nSetting the components to zero gives a system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1 = 4\\xi_1(\\xi_1^2 - 1) = 0 \\\\\n2\\lambda\\xi_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, we find $\\xi_1 = 0$ or $\\xi_1 = \\pm 1$. From the second equation, since $\\lambda > 0$, we must have $\\xi_2 = 0$.\nThus, there are three stationary points: $(-1, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(0, 0)$.\n\nTo classify these points, we compute the Hessian matrix of second derivatives, $H$:\n$$\nH(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\xi_1^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\xi_1 \\partial \\xi_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\xi_2 \\partial \\xi_1} & \\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\xi_2^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12\\xi_1^2 - 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian at each stationary point:\n-   At the points $(\\pm 1, 0)$:\n    $$\n    H(\\pm 1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(1)^2 - 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $8$ and $2\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda > 0$, both eigenvalues are positive. The Hessian is positive definite, so the points $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$ are two symmetry-related local minima.\n\n-   At the point $(0, 0)$:\n    $$\n    H(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(0)^2 - 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $-4$ and $2\\lambda$. Since one eigenvalue is negative and one is positive, this point is a saddle point of index $1$. This saddle point connects the two minima.\n\n2) Determination of the MFEP\n\nThe MFEP is a curve $\\vec{\\alpha}(t) = (\\xi_1(t), \\xi_2(t))$ where the gradient $\\nabla F$ is always parallel to the tangent vector $\\vec{\\tau}(t) = \\frac{d\\vec{\\alpha}}{dt}$. The metric $G=I$ is Euclidean, so orthogonality is defined by the standard dot product. The condition is that the gradient vector has no component orthogonal to the path.\n\nLet the path be represented as a function $\\xi_2 = f(\\xi_1)$. The tangent vector to this curve at any point $(\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$ is proportional to $(1, f'(\\xi_1))$, where $f'(\\xi_1) = \\frac{d\\xi_2}{d\\xi_1}$. A normal vector is therefore proportional to $(-f'(\\xi_1), 1)$.\n\nThe string condition requires that the dot product of the gradient and the normal vector is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla F \\cdot \\vec{n} = (4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1, 2\\lambda\\xi_2) \\cdot (-f'(\\xi_1), 1) = 0\n$$\nThis gives the equation:\n$$\n-(4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1)f'(\\xi_1) + 2\\lambda\\xi_2 = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $f'(\\xi_1) = \\frac{d\\xi_2}{d\\xi_1}$ and $\\xi_2 = f(\\xi_1)$, we obtain the ordinary differential equation for the path:\n$$\n(4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1) \\frac{d\\xi_2}{d\\xi_1} = 2\\lambda\\xi_2\n$$\nThis ODE must be solved subject to the condition that the path connects the two minima, $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$.\n\nA direct and powerful approach is to use the symmetry of the problem. The free energy function $F(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = \\xi_1^4 - 2\\xi_1^2 + \\lambda\\xi_2^2$ is an even function of $\\xi_2$, meaning $F(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = F(\\xi_1, -\\xi_2)$. The $\\xi_1$-axis (where $\\xi_2=0$) is a line of symmetry for the potential. Both minima and the saddle point lie on this axis.\n\nLet us test the hypothesis that the MFEP is the straight line segment along this axis of symmetry, given by $\\xi_2(\\xi_1) = 0$ for $\\xi_1 \\in [-1, 1]$.\nIf we substitute $\\xi_2 = 0$ into the differential equation, we get:\n$$\n(4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1) \\frac{d}{d\\xi_1}(0) = 2\\lambda (0) \\implies 0 = 0\n$$\nThe equation is satisfied for all $\\xi_1$ where the coefficient $(4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1)$ is non-zero (i.e., away from the stationary points). The path $\\xi_2=0$ passes through the points $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$, thus satisfying the boundary conditions. This is a valid solution. Due to the simple nature of the potential, this is the unique MFEP connecting the specified minima.\n\nThis conclusion is also supported by the \"constrained minimization\" principle mentioned in the problem. For any point $(\\xi_1, 0)$ on the proposed path, the orthogonal direction is the $\\xi_2$-axis. The free energy along this direction, for fixed $\\xi_1$, is $F_{\\xi_1}(\\xi_2) = C + \\lambda \\xi_2^2$ where $C = \\xi_1^4-2\\xi_1^2$ is constant. The force along this direction is $-\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\xi_2} = -2\\lambda\\xi_2$. This force is zero at $\\xi_2=0$. Furthermore, $\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\xi_2^2} = 2\\lambda > 0$, so $\\xi_2=0$ represents a minimum of the energy in the hyperplane orthogonal to the path.\n\n3) Verification of the String Condition\n\nWe verify the string condition explicitly for the candidate path $\\xi_2(\\xi_1) = 0$.\nThe path can be parameterized as $\\vec{\\alpha}(\\xi_1) = (\\xi_1, 0)$ for $\\xi_1 \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThe tangent direction is given by the vector $\\vec{\\tau} = (1, 0)$.\nThe normal direction (since $G=I$) is given by the vector $\\vec{n} = (0, 1)$.\nThe gradient of the free energy is $\\nabla F = (4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1, 2\\lambda\\xi_2)$.\nWe evaluate the gradient at a generic point on the path, $(\\xi_1, 0)$:\n$$\n\\nabla F(\\xi_1, 0) = (4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1, 2\\lambda(0)) = (4\\xi_1^3 - 4\\xi_1, 0)\n$$\nThe string condition requires that the component of the gradient normal to the path is zero. This component is given by the projection of $\\nabla F$ onto the normal vector $\\vec{n}$.

It presents a standard scenario in theoretical chemistry to illustrate the critical importance of choosing appropriate collective variables (CVs) for methods like the string method. We will proceed to solve it step-by-step.\n\nThe system is described by the interparticle vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, with magnitude $r = \\|\\mathbf{y}\\|$. The collective variables are given by the map $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(\\mathbf{y}) = (\\theta_{1}(\\mathbf{y}), \\theta_{2}(\\mathbf{y}))$, where $\\theta_{1}(\\mathbf{y}) = r$ and $\\theta_{2}(\\mathbf{y}) = 1/r$. The induced metric on the CV space is given by the tensor $g_{ij}(\\mathbf{y}) = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{i}(\\mathbf{y}) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{j}(\\mathbf{y})$.\n\nFirst, we must compute the gradients of the CVs with respect to the microscopic coordinates $\\mathbf{y}$.\nThe first CV is $\\theta_{1} = r = (\\mathbf{y} \\cdot \\mathbf{y})^{1/2}$. Its gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{1} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} r = \\frac{\\mathbf{y}}{\\|\\mathbf{y}\\|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{y}}{r}\n$$\nThis is a unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{y}$, which we can denote as $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. So, $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{1} = \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nThe second CV is $\\theta_{2} = 1/r$. We compute its gradient using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{2} = \\frac{d(1/r)}{dr} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} r = \\left(-\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the components of the $2 \\times 2$ metric tensor $g(r)$:\n$$\ng_{11} = (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{1}) \\cdot (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{1}) = \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = 1\n$$\n$$\ng_{12} = g_{21} = (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{1}) \\cdot (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{2}) = \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{r^{2}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = -\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\n$$\n$$\ng_{22} = (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{2}) \\cdot (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{2}) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r^{4}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{1}{r^{4}}\n$$\nThus, the metric tensor as a function of $r$ is:\n$$\ng(r) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{r^{2}} & \\frac{1}{r^{4}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the eigenvalues of $g(r)$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(g - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - \\lambda & -\\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{r^{2}} & \\frac{1}{r^{4}} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1 - \\lambda)\\left(\\frac{1}{r^{4}} - \\lambda\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^{4}} - \\lambda - \\frac{\\lambda}{r^{4}} + \\lambda^{2} - \\frac{1}{r^{4}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} - \\lambda\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{r^{4}}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda \\left( \\lambda - \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{r^{4}}\\right) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = 0$ and $\\lambda_{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{r^{4}}$.\n\nThe conditioning of the metric tensor is analyzed through its condition number, $\\kappa(g) = |\\lambda_{\\text{max}}| / |\\lambda_{\\text{min}}|$. Since one eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\text{min}} = 0$ for all $r > 0$, the matrix $g(r)$ is singular, and its condition number is formally infinite. This is the definition of an ill-conditioned system. The source of this singularity is the functional dependence of the CVs: $\\theta_{2} = 1/\\theta_{1}$. This means that the two CVs do not span a two-dimensional space but are confined to a one-dimensional curve. Consequently, their gradients are linearly dependent (in fact, collinear): $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{2} = -(1/r^{2}) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{1}$. This redundancy results in a rank-deficient metric tensor.\n\nAs $r \\to 0^{+}$, the non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}(r) = 1 + 1/r^{4}$ diverges to infinity. This behavior indicates a severe pathology. The divergence comes from the gradient of $\\theta_{2}$, whose magnitude $\\|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta_{2}\\| = 1/r^{2}$ blows up as $r$ approaches zero. This implies that an infinitesimally small displacement in the microscopic coordinates $\\mathbf{y}$ near the origin corresponds to an explosively large distance in the CV space, rendering numerical calculations such as arc-length parametrization in the string method unstable or impossible.\n\nTo propose a better-behaved set of CVs, we must address the two identified flaws: the functional dependence (collinear gradients) and the diverging gradient magnitude. A well-behaved set of CVs should have gradients that are linearly independent (ideally orthogonal) and whose magnitudes do not diverge in the domain of interest.\n\nA simple and robust choice is to use a subset of the Cartesian components of $\\mathbf{y}$ itself. For instance, let the new CVs be:\n$$\n\\theta'_{1}(\\mathbf{y}) = y_{1}, \\quad \\theta'_{2}(\\mathbf{y}) = y_{2}\n$$\nThe gradients of these CVs are the constant standard basis vectors:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta'_{1} = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{1} = (1, 0, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\theta'_{2} = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{2} = (0, 1, 0)\n$$\nThese gradients are orthogonal ($\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{1} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_{2} = 0$) and have constant unit norm. The resulting metric tensor is the identity matrix:\n$$\ng' = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis metric is perfectly conditioned, with both eigenvalues equal to $1$ and a condition number of $1$ everywhere. It has no singularities and introduces no numerical instabilities. The only theoretical compromise is the loss of rotational invariance, as the CVs now depend on the orientation of the coordinate system. In many physical problems, this is an acceptable trade-off for numerical stability. If rotational invariance is paramount, one must recognize that for an isolated two-particle system, only one such independent CV (e.g., $r$) can be defined, and attempting to force a second creates the exact problem we have analyzed.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the analytical expression for the nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda(r)$ of the original metric $g(r)$. As derived, this is $\\lambda_{2}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 + \\frac{1}{r^{4}}} $$", "id": "2822361"}]}
