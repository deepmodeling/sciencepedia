By analytically solving this model, you will directly see how the electron-hole interaction mixes initial transitions, leading to the formation of optically 'bright' and 'dark' excitons and revealing the physical origin of excitonic energy splittings.", "problem": "Consider a minimal Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) model for singlet excitons constructed in a basis of two independent interband transitions, denoted by $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$. Each transition has the same independent-particle excitation energy $\\Delta > 0$. In this minimal model, the electron-hole screened direct interaction adds an identical diagonal shift $U$ to both transitions, and the electron-hole exchange interaction couples the transitions with a symmetric off-diagonal matrix element $X$. Thus, in the resonant particle-hole basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\}$, the excitonic Hamiltonian is a $2\\times 2$ real symmetric matrix\n$$\nH \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\Delta + U  X \\\\\nX  \\Delta + U\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe excitonic eigenproblem is $H\\,\\boldsymbol{A}=\\Omega\\,\\boldsymbol{A}$, where $\\boldsymbol{A}=(A_{1}, A_{2})^{\\mathsf{T}}$ are the expansion coefficients of the exciton in the chosen basis. The optical oscillator strength along a fixed polarization is proportional to the squared magnitude of the exciton transition dipole, which in this basis is $|\\boldsymbol{t}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{A}|^2$, where $\\boldsymbol{t}=(t_{1}, t_{2})$ collects the single-particle transition dipoles.

The Hamiltonian represents a common scenario of two degenerate states coupled by an interaction. This is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and solid-state physics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is presented as a standard eigenvalue problem for a $2\\times 2$ symmetric matrix, which is always solvable. The condition for a \"dark\" state is mathematically precise. The problem is well-posed and has a unique solution for the energy of the dark state.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. All terms are defined within the context of theoretical physics. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- The problem is self-contained, consistent, and provides all necessary information to arrive at a solution.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is a standard exercise in quantum mechanics. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues $\\Omega$ and corresponding eigenvectors $\\boldsymbol{A}$ of the exciton are determined by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation, which in matrix form is the eigenproblem $H\\boldsymbol{A} = \\Omega\\boldsymbol{A}$. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H - \\Omega I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta + U - \\Omega  X \\\\ X  \\Delta + U - \\Omega \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the secular equation:\n$$\n(\\Delta + U - \\Omega)^2 - X^2 = 0\n$$\nThis equation is solved for $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\Delta + U - \\Omega = \\pm X\n$$\n$$\n\\Omega = \\Delta + U \\mp X\n$$\nThis yields two distinct energy eigenvalues for the exciton states, provided $X \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{1} = \\Delta + U - X\n$$\n$$\n\\Omega_{2} = \\Delta + U + X\n$$\nNext, we determine the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor the eigenvalue $\\Omega_{1} = \\Delta + U - X$, the eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{A}_{1} = (A_{1,1}, A_{1,2})^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is found by solving:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta + U  X \\\\ X  \\Delta + U \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,1} \\\\ A_{1,2} \\end{pmatrix} = (\\Delta + U - X) \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,1} \\\\ A_{1,2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the system of linear equations:\n$$\n(\\Delta + U)A_{1,1} + X A_{1,2} = (\\Delta + U - X)A_{1,1}\n$$\nSimplifying the equation, we obtain:\n$$\nX A_{1,1} + X A_{1,2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nX(A_{1,1} + A_{1,2}) = 0\n$$\nAssuming the coupling $X$ is non-zero (otherwise the states are trivially degenerate and uncoupled, a case we can address later), this implies $A_{1,1} = -A_{1,2}$. The unnormalized eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nFor the eigenvalue $\\Omega_{2} = \\Delta + U + X$, the eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{A}_{2} = (A_{2,1}, A_{2,2})^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is found by solving:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta + U  X \\\\ X  \\Delta + U \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_{2,1} \\\\ A_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix} = (\\Delta + U + X) \\begin{pmatrix} A_{2,1} \\\\ A_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the equation:\n$$\n(\\Delta + U)A_{2,1} + X A_{2,2} = (\\Delta + U + X)A_{2,1}\n$$\nSimplifying, we have:\n$$\n-X A_{2,1} + X A_{2,2} = 0\n$$\n$$\nX(-A_{2,1} + A_{2,2}) = 0\n$$\nAgain, assuming $X \\neq 0$, this implies $A_{2,1} = A_{2,2}$. The unnormalized eigenvector is proportional to $(1, 1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nNow, we must identify the \"dark\" state. A state is dark if its oscillator strength is zero. The oscillator strength is proportional to $|\\boldsymbol{t}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{A}|^2$, where $\\boldsymbol{t} = (t_{1}, t_{2})$. We are given that $t_{1} = t_{2} = t$ and $t \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{t} = (t, t)$.\nThe condition for a dark state is $|\\boldsymbol{t}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{A}|^2=0$, which is equivalent to $\\boldsymbol{t}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{A}=0$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{A} = (t, t) \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1} \\\\ A_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = tA_{1} + tA_{2} = t(A_{1} + A_{2}) = 0\n$$\nSince $t \\neq 0$, the condition for a dark state simplifies to:\n$$\nA_{1} + A_{2} = 0\n$$\nWe check this condition for the two eigenvectors we found.\n- For the state with energy $\\Omega_{1} = \\Delta + U - X$, the eigenvector components satisfy $A_{1,1} = -A_{1,2}$. Thus, $A_{1,1} + A_{1,2} = -A_{1,2} + A_{1,2} = 0$. This condition is met. This state is the dark exciton.\n- For the state with energy $\\Omega_{2} = \\Delta + U + X$, the eigenvector components satisfy $A_{2,1} = A_{2,2}$. Thus, $A_{2,1} + A_{2,2} = A_{2,2} + A_{2,2} = 2A_{2,2}$. This is zero only if $A_{2,2}=0$, which would mean the eigenvector is the null vector, which is not a valid physical state. Therefore, this state is not dark; it is \"bright\".\n\nThe energy of the dark state, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{d}}$, is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector that satisfies the dark state condition. This is $\\Omega_{1}$.\nTherefore, the exciton energy of the dark state is:\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\Delta + U - X\n$$\nIf we consider the case where $X=0$, the Hamiltonian is diagonal, $H = (\\Delta+U)I$. Any vector is an eigenvector with the degenerate energy $\\Omega = \\Delta+U$. We can still form the \"symmetric\" and \"antisymmetric\" combinations of the basis states. The state with eigenvector proportional to $(1, -1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is dark and has energy $\\Delta+U$. Our formula gives $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\Delta + U - 0 = \\Delta + U$, so it remains correct.\nThe final answer is the derived analytical expression for the energy of the dark exciton.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\Delta + U - X}\n$$", "id": "2463571"}, {"introduction": "Solving the full BSE involves a Hamiltonian with a specific structure that couples resonant (electron-hole) and antiresonant (hole-electron) excitations, which can be computationally demanding.

All provided data and definitions are consistent with the established principles of many-body perturbation theory used in computational chemistry and condensed matter physics. The task is a straightforward numerical implementation of a standard theoretical model. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the singlet exciton binding energy, $E_b$, for two different theoretical starting points, Hartree-Fock ($HF$) and Density Functional Theory ($DFT$-$PBE$), and then find the difference between these two results. This is to be repeated for four distinct test cases.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is the Bethe-Salpeter equation ($BSE$) within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation ($TDA$). For singlet excitations, the excitonic Hamiltonian, $H$, is constructed in a discrete basis of $N$ single-particle transitions from occupied states $\\ket{v_i}$ to unoccupied states $\\ket{c_i}$. The Hamiltonian matrix elements are given by:\n$$\nH_{ij} = \\Delta_i \\delta_{ij} + K_{ij}\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta_i = \\epsilon_{c_i} - \\epsilon_{v_i}$ are the energy differences of the non-interacting transitions, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The matrix $K$ is the interaction kernel, which for singlet excitons is:\n$$\nK_{ij} = -W_{ij} + 2v_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $W_{ij}$ is the statically screened direct electron-hole Coulomb interaction and $v_{ij}$ is the bare exchange interaction. All matrices are real and symmetric.\n\nThe computational procedure to determine the binding energy $E_b$ for a given set of parameters ($\\{\\Delta_i\\}$, $W$, $v$) is as follows:\n\n1.  **Construct the Interaction Kernel Matrix $K$**:\n    For each pair of indices $(i, j)$ from $1$ to $N$, calculate the kernel matrix element $K_{ij}$ using the provided matrices for the screened interaction $W$ and the bare exchange $v$. The calculation is $K = -W + 2v$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Excitonic Hamiltonian Matrix $H$**:\n    The Hamiltonian $H$ is formed by adding the diagonal matrix of transition energies, $\\text{diag}(\\Delta)$, to the kernel $K$. In matrix form, this is $H = \\text{diag}(\\Delta_1, \\Delta_2, \\dots, \\Delta_N) + K$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Lowest Exciton Energy $E_0$**:\n    The Hamiltonian $H$ is a real, symmetric $N \\times N$ matrix. Its eigenvalues represent the energies of the excitonic states. We must solve the eigenvalue problem $H \\Psi = E \\Psi$. The lowest exciton energy, $E_0$, is the minimum eigenvalue of $H$.\n    $$\n    E_0 = \\min(\\text{eig}(H))\n    $$\n    This is a standard numerical linear algebra task, accomplished by diagonalizing the matrix $H$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Quasiparticle Gap $E_g$**:\n    The quasiparticle gap, $E_g$, is defined as the minimum energy required to create a non-interacting electron-hole pair. This corresponds to the smallest single-particle transition energy provided.\n    $$\n    E_g = \\min_{i} \\Delta_i\n    $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Exciton Binding Energy $E_b$**:\n    The exciton binding energy is the energy gained by the electron and hole binding together via their interaction, relative to the non-interacting state. It is the difference between the quasiparticle gap and the lowest exciton energy.\n    $$\n    E_b = E_g - E_0\n    $$\n\nThis entire procedure is performed twice for each test case: once using the Hartree-Fock parameters ($\\Delta^{\\mathrm{HF}}$, $W^{\\mathrm{HF}}$, $v^{\\mathrm{HF}}$) to obtain $E_b^{\\mathrm{HF}}$, and once using the DFT-PBE parameters ($\\Delta^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$, $W^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$, $v^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$) to obtain $E_b^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$.\n\nFinally, the difference in binding energies is calculated as:\n$$\n\\Delta E_b = E_b^{\\mathrm{HF}} - E_b^{\\mathrm{PBE}}\n$$\nThe problem requires these three values, $[E_b^{\\mathrm{HF}}, E_b^{\\mathrm{PBE}}, \\Delta E_b]$, to be reported for each test case, with each numerical value rounded to six decimal places.
