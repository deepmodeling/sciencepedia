It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantum scattering theory that is free of contradictions or ambiguities.

It is a well-posed problem within the established framework of quantum scattering theory, with all necessary definitions provided and no internal contradictions or scientific inaccuracies.\n\nThe solution proceeds by directly solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the specified potential.

The first term on the right-hand side is an operator proportional to the projector $|\\chi\\rangle\\langle\\chi|$. The second term also contains this projector, as $V$ acts first on $G_{0}^{(+)}(E) T(E)$. This structure implies that the operator $T(E)$ itself must be proportional to the projector $|\\chi\\rangle\\langle\\chi|$. We therefore make the ansatz:\n$$T(E) = |\\chi\\rangle \\tau(E) \\langle\\chi|$$\nwhere $\\tau(E)$ is a scalar function of energy $E$ that must be determined. This is the only possible form for the operator $T(E)$, as any state vector resulting from the action of $T(E)$ must be proportional to $|\\chi\\rangle$.\n\nSubstituting this ansatz back into the Lippmann-Schwinger equation yields:\n$$|\\chi\\rangle \\tau(E) \\langle\\chi| = |\\chi\\rangle \\lambda \\langle\\chi| + |\\chi\\rangle \\lambda \\langle\\chi| G_{0}^{(+)}(E) \\left( |\\chi\\rangle \\tau(E) \\langle\\chi| \\right)$$\nThe term $\\langle\\chi| G_{0}^{(+)}(E) |\\chi\\rangle$ is a scalar complex number, which we can denote for brevity as $g(E)$.

The denominator of $\\tau(E)$ is $1 - \\lambda \\langle\\chi|G_{0}^{(+)}(E)|\\chi\\rangle$. For $E < 0$, the operator $E - H_{0}$ is strictly negative definite, since the spectrum of the free Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ is non-negative. Consequently, the Green's operator $G_{0}(E) = (E - H_{0})^{-1}$ is well-defined on the negative real axis and has no poles, so the infinitesimal imaginary part $\\mathrm{i}0^{+}$ in $G_{0}^{(+)}(E)$ is not required. The analytic continuation of $\\langle\\chi|G_{0}^{(+)}(E)|\\chi\\rangle$ to the negative real axis is simply $\\langle\\chi|G_{0}(E)|\\chi\\rangle$.\nTherefore, a bound state with energy $E_{b} < 0$ exists if the analytically continued denominator vanishes at $E = E_{b}$:\n$$1 - \\lambda \\langle\\chi| G_{0}(E_{b}) |\\chi\\rangle = 0$$\nThe problem asks for the scalar analytic denominator function, $D_{b}(E)$, whose zeros for $E < 0$ determine the bound-state energies.

We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. First, we must address the pathologies of the first Born approximation when applied to the pure Coulomb potential. Second, we must derive the scattering amplitude for a regularized, screened potential. Third, we must recover the Coulomb scattering amplitude in a specific, well-defined limit.\n\nPart (a): The first Born approximation for the scattering amplitude $f^{(1)}(\\theta, \\phi)$ is given by the expression\n$$\nf^{(1)}(\\theta, \\phi) = -\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} \\int d^{3}r' V(\\vec{r}') \\exp(i\\vec{q} \\cdot \\vec{r}')\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $V(\\vec{r}')$ is the scattering potential, and $\\vec{q} = \\vec{k}_{i} - \\vec{k}_{f}$ is the momentum transfer vector, with $\\vec{k}_{i}$ and $\\vec{k}_{f}$ being the incident and final wave vectors, respectively. For elastic scattering, $|\\vec{k}_{i}| = |\\vec{k}_{f}| = k$, and the magnitude of the momentum transfer is $q = 2k\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$, where $\\theta$ is the scattering angle.\n\nThe Born approximation is derived from perturbation theory. Its validity rests on the assumption that the scattered wave is a small perturbation to the incident plane wave. This is generally true for potentials that are \"weak\" or for high incident energies. A more formal condition is that the potential must be short-ranged, meaning it must fall off sufficiently fast at large distances $r$. A common requirement for the applicability of the standard scattering formalism, including the first Born approximation, is that the potential $V(r)$ must satisfy $\\int_{a}^{\\infty} |V(r)| dr < \\infty$ for some radius $a$, and ideally that $rV(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe Coulomb potential, $V(r) = C/r$, violates this condition. It is a long-range potential. The integral $\\int^{\\infty} |C/r| dr$ diverges logarithmically. Physically, a long-range potential modifies the state of the particle even at arbitrarily large distances. The true asymptotic wave functions are not plane waves $e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}}$, but are distorted by a logarithmic phase factor. The assumption of an incident plane wave, fundamental to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the resulting Born series, is therefore invalid from the outset.\n\nA direct mathematical symptom of this failure appears when we attempt to calculate the scattering amplitude.

It oscillates without approaching a limit. This mathematical divergence is a direct consequence of the invalid physical assumption that the Coulomb potential is a short-range perturbation. The Fourier transform of the $1/r$ potential is not well-defined as a regular function, but only as a distribution.\n\nPart (b): To regularize the potential, we replace it with the screened Yukawa potential $V_{\\lambda}(r) = C \\exp(-\\lambda r)/r$, where $\\lambda > 0$ is a screening parameter.
