In a lowest-order Linear Vibronic Coupling (LVC) model, we include linear terms that split and couple the diabatic states and quadratic harmonic terms that stabilize displacements away from the MECI. Because we adopt dimensionless normal-mode coordinates, the harmonic coefficients enter as effective frequencies in energy units $\\hbar \\omega$.\n\n1. Model construction. Consider the diabatic Hamiltonian\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_\\text{dia}(g,h) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nE_0 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Omega_g g^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Omega_h h^2 + \\kappa_g g & \\kappa_h h \\\\\n\\kappa_h h & E_0 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Omega_g g^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Omega_h h^2 - \\kappa_g g\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nwhere $E_0$ is an energy offset at $g=h=0$, $\\kappa_g$ controls the linear splitting along $g$ (tuning coordinate), $\\kappa_h$ controls the linear interstate coupling along $h$ (coupling coordinate), and $\\Omega_g,\\Omega_h$ are effective harmonic coefficients (in eV) along $g$ and $h$, respectively. The diagonal average is\n$$\nE_\\text{avg}(g,h) = E_0 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Omega_g g^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Omega_h h^2,\n$$\nthe diabatic difference is $\\Delta(g,h) = 2\\kappa_g g$, and the diabatic coupling is $C(g,h)=\\kappa_h h$.\n\n2. Adiabatic energies. The adiabatic energies $E_{S_0}$ and $E_{S_1}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{H}_\\text{dia}(g,h)$, which for a real symmetric $2 \\times 2$ matrix with equal average and difference $\\pm \\Delta/2$ and coupling $C$ are\n$$\nE_{S_{1,0}}(g,h) = E_\\text{avg}(g,h) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\kappa_g g\\right)^2 + \\left(\\kappa_h h\\right)^2}.\n$$\nThis follows from the characteristic polynomial of a $2\\times 2$ matrix, yielding eigenvalues $E_\\text{avg} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\Delta/2)^2 + C^2}$, with $(\\Delta/2)^2 = (\\kappa_g g)^2$ and $C^2=(\\kappa_h h)^2$. The â$+$â branch corresponds to the upper adiabatic state $S_1$ and the â$-$â branch to the lower adiabatic state $S_0$.\n\n3. Coordinate parameterization. A one-dimensional scan at angle $\\theta$ (in degrees) is parameterized by a displacement $q \\in \\mathbb{R}$ via\n$$\ng(q,\\theta) = q \\cos\\left(\\theta \\dfrac{\\pi}{180}\\right), \\quad\nh(q,\\theta) = q \\sin\\left(\\theta \\dfrac{\\pi}{180}\\right).\n$$\nThis permits straightforward generation of training and validation points along straight lines in the branching plane.\n\n4. Fitting task. We are given synthetic âab initioâ datasets that are defined by evaluating the model adiabatic energies at specified training scans for known true parameters, but we do not use these truths in the fitting; instead, we recover them by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between model and data. Denote the parameter vector by\n$$\n\\mathbf{p} = \\left(E_0, \\kappa_g, \\kappa_h, \\Omega_g, \\Omega_h\\right),\n$$\nand the model energies by $E^{\\text{model}}_{S_0}(g,h;\\mathbf{p})$ and $E^{\\text{model}}_{S_1}(g,h;\\mathbf{p})$ according to the expressions in step 2. For a set of training points $\\{(g_i,h_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$ with synthetic data $\\{E^{\\text{data}}_{S_0,i}, E^{\\text{data}}_{S_1,i}\\}$, define the residual vector\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{p}) = \\left(\nE^{\\text{model}}_{S_0}(g_1,h_1;\\mathbf{p}) - E^{\\text{data}}_{S_0,1}, \\;\nE^{\\text{model}}_{S_1}(g_1,h_1;\\mathbf{p}) - E^{\\text{data}}_{S_1,1}, \\;\n\\dots,\\;\nE^{\\text{model}}_{S_0}(g_N,h_N;\\mathbf{p}) - E^{\\text{data}}_{S_0,N}, \\;\nE^{\\text{model}}_{S_1}(g_N,h_N;\\mathbf{p}) - E^{\\text{data}}_{S_1,N}\n\\right)^\\top.\n$$\nThe least-squares problem is\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{p}} \\; \\|\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{p})\\|_2^2\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad\n\\kappa_g \\ge 0, \\; \\kappa_h \\ge 0, \\; \\Omega_g \\ge 0, \\; \\Omega_h \\ge 0,\n$$\nwith $E_0$ unconstrained. We solve this numerically (for example, by a trust-region or LevenbergâMarquardt-like method with bound constraints), using reasonable initial guesses such as the average of all training energies for $E_0$ and positive values for the remaining parameters. The constraints reflect the physical interpretation that linear magnitudes and harmonic curvatures are non-negative near the MECI; the sign indeterminacy of $\\kappa_g$ and $\\kappa_h$ in the eigenvalue formula is resolved by restricting to non-negative solutions.\n\n5. Validation. After obtaining the fitted parameters $\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}$, we predict energies on a validation scan orthogonal to one of the training scans: for a set of validation points $\\{(g_j^\\text{val},h_j^\\text{val})\\}_{j=1}^M$, compute\n$$\nE^{\\text{pred}}_{S_{0,1},j} = E^{\\text{model}}_{S_{0,1}}(g_j^\\text{val},h_j^\\text{val};\\widehat{\\mathbf{p}}), \\quad\nE^{\\text{true}}_{S_{0,1},j} = E^{\\text{model}}_{S_{0,1}}(g_j^\\text{val},h_j^\\text{val};\\mathbf{p}_\\text{true}),\n$$\nand the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in electronvolts over both states combined:\n$$\n\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\n\\dfrac{1}{2M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M}\n\\left( \\left[E^{\\text{pred}}_{S_0,j} - E^{\\text{true}}_{S_0,j}\\right]^2 +\n\\left[E^{\\text{pred}}_{S_1,j} - E^{\\text{true}}_{S_1,j}\\right]^2 \\right)\n}.\n$$\nBecause the synthetic data are noiseless and the parameterization is identifiable with two non-collinear training scans, the fit should recover the true parameters to within numerical precision, and the RMSE should be effectively zero.\n\n6. Algorithmic design. For each of the three cases in the test suite:\n- Generate training and validation coordinates $(g,h)$ from the $(q,\\theta)$ specification using $g=q\\cos(\\theta \\pi/180)$ and $h=q\\sin(\\theta \\pi/180)$.\n- Generate synthetic training energies by evaluating the model at the true parameters.\n- Set initial guesses, assemble the residuals over all training points, and solve the constrained least-squares problem numerically.\n- Using the fitted parameters, generate predictions on the validation scan and compute the RMSE in electronvolts as described.\n- Round the fitted parameters and RMSE to five decimal places.\n\n7. Output. Collect the results for the three cases in order, each as a list\n$$\n\\left[ \\kappa_g^\\text{fit},\\; \\kappa_h^\\text{fit},\\; \\Omega_g^\\text{fit},\\; \\Omega_h^\\text{fit},\\; E_0^\\text{fit},\\; \\text{RMSE} \\right],\n$$\nand print a single line that is a list of these three lists, with entries rounded to five decimal places, for example:\n$$\n\\left[\n[\\dots],\\; [\\dots],\\; [\\dots]\n\\right].\n$$\nAll entries must be in units of electronvolts (eV).\n\nThis procedure demonstrates how the LVC model near a conical intersection connects fundamental diabatic expansions to observable adiabatic energy splittings, and how parameter inference by least squares enables quantitative predictions on orthogonal scans in the branching plane.", "answer": "[[1.20000, 0.80000, 0.50000, 0.70000, 3.80000, 0.00000], [0.90000, 1.10000, 0.60000, 0.40000, 4.30000, 0.00000], [1.50000, 0.60000, 0.55000, 0.55000, 3.20000, 0.00000]]", "id": "2765943"}]}
