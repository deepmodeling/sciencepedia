Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe motion of the particle is governed by Newton's second law, which includes the harmonic potential force, a linear friction force, and a stochastic random force from the heat bath.

We will proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the transformation of the Itô SDE\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x_{t} = a(x_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + b(x_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nunder the change of variables $y_{t} = g(x_{t})$, where $g(x) = \\arctan(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,x)$. The resulting SDE is to be expressed in the form\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}y_{t} = \\mathcal{A}(y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\mathcal{B}(y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}.\n$$\nThe transformation of the drift and diffusion coefficients is dictated by the Itô chain rule (also known as Itô's lemma). For a function $y = g(x)$, the rule states:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}y_{t} = \\left( a(x_{t}) g'(x_{t}) + \\frac{1}{2} b(x_{t})^2 g''(x_{t}) \\right) \\mathrm{d}t + b(x_{t}) g'(x_{t}) \\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the transformed drift $\\mathcal{A}(y)$ and diffusion amplitude $\\mathcal{B}(y)$ as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(y) = a(x) g'(x) + \\frac{1}{2} b(x)^2 g''(x)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(y) = b(x) g'(x)\n$$\nwhere the final expressions must be given as functions of $y$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required derivatives of the transformation function $g(x) = \\arctan(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,x)$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\arctan(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{1 + (\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,x)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\n$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\ng''(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\cdot (-1) (1 + \\lambda x^2)^{-2} \\cdot (2\\lambda x) = -\\frac{2\\lambda^{\\frac{3}{2}} x}{(1 + \\lambda x^2)^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the explicit forms for the original drift $a(x)$ and the term $b(x)^2$.\nThe potential is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$, so its derivative is $U'(x) = kx$.\nThe diffusion profile is $D(x) = D_{0}(1 + \\lambda x^2)$, so its derivative is $D'(x) = 2D_{0}\\lambda x$.\nSubstituting these into the given expression for the drift $a(x) = -\\beta D(x) U'(x) + D'(x)$:\n$$\na(x) = -\\beta \\left(D_{0}(1 + \\lambda x^2)\\right) (kx) + 2D_{0}\\lambda x = - \\beta D_{0} k x (1 + \\lambda x^2) + 2D_{0}\\lambda x\n$$\nThe noise amplitude is $b(x) = \\sqrt{2D(x)}$, which gives:\n$$\nb(x)^2 = 2D(x) = 2D_{0}(1 + \\lambda x^2)\n$$\n\nNow we compute the terms for the transformed drift $\\mathcal{A}(y)$.\nThe first term is $a(x)g'(x)$:\n$$\na(x)g'(x) = \\left[- \\beta D_{0} k x (1 + \\lambda x^2) + 2D_{0}\\lambda x\\right] \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\\right) = - \\beta D_{0} k x \\sqrt{\\lambda} + \\frac{2D_{0}\\lambda^{\\frac{3}{2}} x}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\n$$\nThe second term is $\\frac{1}{2} b(x)^2 g''(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} b(x)^2 g''(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[2D_{0}(1 + \\lambda x^2)\\right] \\left(-\\frac{2\\lambda^{\\frac{3}{2}}x}{(1 + \\lambda x^2)^2}\\right) = -\\frac{2D_{0}\\lambda^{\\frac{3}{2}}x}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\n$$\nSumming these two terms to find $\\mathcal{A}(y)$, we observe a cancellation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(y) = \\left(- \\beta D_{0} k x \\sqrt{\\lambda} + \\frac{2D_{0}\\lambda^{\\frac{3}{2}} x}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{2D_{0}\\lambda^{\\frac{3}{2}}x}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\\right) = - \\beta D_{0} k x \\sqrt{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the transformed diffusion amplitude $\\mathcal{B}(y)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(y) = b(x)g'(x) = \\sqrt{2D(x)} g'(x) = \\sqrt{2D_{0}(1 + \\lambda x^2)} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{1 + \\lambda x^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2D_{0}\\lambda}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\lambda x^2}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we express these results in terms of the new coordinate $y$. The coordinate transformation is $y = \\arctan(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,x)$. This is invertible for $y \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, giving $\\tan(y) = \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\,x$, or $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\tan(y)$.\nWe substitute this inverse relation into the expressions for $\\mathcal{A}(y)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(y)$.\nFor the drift $\\mathcal{A}(y)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(y) = - \\beta D_{0} k x \\sqrt{\\lambda} = - \\beta D_{0} k \\left(\\frac{\\tan(y)}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\right) \\sqrt{\\lambda} = - \\beta D_{0} k \\tan(y)\n$$\nFor the diffusion $\\mathcal{B}(y)$, we first re-express the term $\\sqrt{1 + \\lambda x^2}$:\n$$\n1 + \\lambda x^2 = 1 + \\lambda \\left(\\frac{\\tan(y)}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\tan^2(y) = \\sec^2(y)\n$$\nSince $y \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $\\cos(y) > 0$ and thus $\\sec(y) > 0$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{1 + \\lambda x^2} = \\sec(y)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathcal{B}(y)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(y) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2D_{0}\\lambda}}{\\sec(y)} = \\sqrt{2D_{0}\\lambda} \\cos(y)\n$$\n\nThe explicit analytic expressions for the transformed drift and diffusion amplitude in terms of $y$ and the given parameters are:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(y) = - \\beta D_{0} k \\tan(y)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}(y) = \\sqrt{2D_{0}\\lambda} \\cos(y)\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a row vector $\\big[\\mathcal{A}(y), \\mathcal{B}(y)\\big]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} - \\beta D_{0} k \\tan(y) & \\sqrt{2 D_{0} \\lambda} \\cos(y) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2815970"}]}
