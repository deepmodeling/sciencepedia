As instructed, the trapezoidal rule is used:\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\gamma}(s) \\approx \\int_0^T \\gamma(t) e^{-st} dt \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\frac{f(t_n) + f(t_{n+1})}{2} \\Delta t\n    $$\n    where the time grid is $t_n = n\\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, N$, with $T=N\\Delta t$.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Reactive Frequency $s_\\star$**: The positive root $s_\\star$ of the characteristic equation $f(s) = s^2 + s\\hat{\\gamma}(s) - \\omega_{b, \\text{est}}^2 = 0$ is found using a numerical root-finding algorithm. We note that $f(0) = -\\omega_{b, \\text{est}}^2  0$ and $f(\\omega_{b, \\text{est}}) = \\omega_{b, \\text{est}} \\hat{\\gamma}(\\omega_{b, \\text{est}}) > 0$. This brackets the root $s_\\star$ in the interval $(0, \\omega_{b, \\text{est}})$, allowing for the use of a robust algorithm such as the Brent-Dekker method.\n\n4.  **Calculate Transmission Coefficient $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{GH}}$**: With the estimated $\\omega_{b, \\text{est}}$ and the computed $s_\\star$, the transmission coefficient is calculated as $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{GH}} = s_\\star / \\omega_{b, \\text{est}}$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three test cases specified.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Grote-Hynes theory problem for three test cases.\n    The procedure involves:\n    1.
