Using a standard model for basis-set error, you will quantify the dramatic improvement F12 methods offer, demonstrating how they enable the routine achievement of chemical accuracy with computationally tractable basis sets [@problem_id:2773778].", "problem": "You will model the basis-set convergence of reaction barrier heights in Coupled Cluster with Singles Doubles and perturbative Triples (CCSD(T)) and its explicitly correlated variant CCSD(T)-F12b (explicitly correlated F12 method) using first-principles assumptions about the electron-electron cusp and the resulting basis-set incompleteness error. Work entirely in the Born–Oppenheimer electronic energy framework. The explicit correlation ansatz introduces the interelectronic distance into the wave function to satisfy the Kato cusp condition, accelerating the convergence of the correlation energy with respect to the one-electron basis cardinal number.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions to use:\n- The barrier height for a reaction is the difference between the transition state energy and reactant energy, both defined on the same potential energy surface, i.e., the barrier height is $B = E_{\\mathrm{TS}} - E_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n- For correlation-consistent basis families, the leading basis-set incompleteness error in the electronic correlation energy for each electronic state decays as a power law in the basis cardinal number $n$ (e.g., $n=2$ for a double-zeta basis, $n=3$ for a triple-zeta basis), with a method-dependent exponent reflecting how well the electron-electron cusp is treated. This exponent is smaller for conventional orbital-only methods and larger when Explicitly Correlated (R12/F12) terms are included. The proportionality constants can differ between the reactant and the transition state due to their differing correlation characteristics.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the barrier definition $B = E_{\\mathrm{TS}} - E_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and the linearity of energy differences, derive how the leading-order barrier height error depends on the basis cardinal number $n$, the method-dependent convergence exponent, and the state-specific proportionality constants. Do this for both conventional CCSD(T) and CCSD(T)-F12b. No shortcuts or pre-baked formulas should be invoked beyond the assumptions above and the definition of a barrier height.\n2. Using your derived expressions, write a program that, for each reaction in the test suite below, computes the barrier height error at $n=2$ (double-zeta) and $n=3$ (triple-zeta) for both CCSD(T) and CCSD(T)-F12b, then aggregates the following metrics across the test suite, all expressed in kilojoules per mole:\n   - Mean absolute error (MAE) at $n=2$ for CCSD(T).\n   - Mean absolute error (MAE) at $n=2$ for CCSD(T)-F12b.\n   - Mean absolute error (MAE) at $n=3$ for CCSD(T).\n   - Mean absolute error (MAE) at $n=3$ for CCSD(T)-F12b.\n   - Maximum absolute error at $n=2$ for CCSD(T).\n   - Maximum absolute error at $n=2$ for CCSD(T)-F12b.\n   - Maximum absolute error at $n=3$ for CCSD(T).\n   - Maximum absolute error at $n=3$ for CCSD(T)-F12b.\n   - Fraction (expressed as a decimal, not a percentage) of reactions with absolute error less than or equal to the chemical accuracy threshold of $1$ kcal/mol at $n=2$ for CCSD(T), where $1$ kcal/mol $= 4.184$ kJ/mol.\n   - Fraction (expressed as a decimal) within the same threshold at $n=2$ for CCSD(T)-F12b.\n   - Fraction (expressed as a decimal) within the same threshold at $n=3$ for CCSD(T).\n   - Fraction (expressed as a decimal) within the same threshold at $n=3$ for CCSD(T)-F12b.\n3. Use the following test suite. For each reaction $i$, the complete-basis-set (CBS) barrier height is provided relative to the reactant as $B^{\\mathrm{CBS}}_i$ in kJ/mol, and the leading-order proportionality constants for the reactant and transition state are given for both methods. Use a conventional CCSD(T) exponent $p = 3$ and a CCSD(T)-F12b exponent $p_{\\mathrm{F12}} = 6$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum chemistry, specifically electronic structure theory, and is mathematically well-posed. All necessary data and constraints are provided, forming a self-contained and logical problem. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, a derivation of the basis-set error in a calculated reaction barrier height, and second, a numerical implementation to quantify this error for conventional and explicitly correlated quantum chemical methods across a given test suite.\n\nWe begin with the derivation. The fundamental premise is the asymptotic behavior of the electronic energy computed with a basis set of cardinal number $n$. For a given electronic state $S$, which may be a reactant ($S = \\mathrm{R}$) or a transition state ($S = \\mathrm{TS}$), the energy $E_S(n)$ approximates the complete-basis-set (CBS) limit energy $E_S^{\\mathrm{CBS}}$ according to the leading-order error term:\n$$\nE_S(n) \\approx E_S^{\\mathrm{CBS}} + \\frac{A_S}{n^p}\n$$\nHere, $A_S$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the specifics of the electronic state $S$, and $p$ is an exponent that depends on the theoretical method used. The term $\\frac{A_S}{n^p}$ represents the basis-set incompleteness error (BSIE), which is positive, as variational calculations with finite basis sets yield energies above the true CBS limit.\n\nThe reaction barrier height, $B$, is defined as the energy difference between the transition state and the reactant:\n$$\nB(n) = E_{\\mathrm{TS}}(n) - E_{\\mathrm{R}}(n)\n$$\nThis is the barrier height computed with a basis of cardinal number $n$. The true, or CBS, barrier height is:\n$$\nB^{\\mathrm{CBS}} = E_{\\mathrm{TS}}^{\\mathrm{CBS}} - E_{\\mathrm{R}}^{\\mathrm{CBS}}\n$$\nTo derive the error in the barrier height, we substitute the expressions for $E_{\\mathrm{TS}}(n)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{R}}(n)$ into the equation for $B(n)$:\n$$\nB(n) \\approx \\left( E_{\\mathrm{TS}}^{\\mathrm{CBS}} + \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{TS}}}{n^p} \\right) - \\left( E_{\\mathrm{R}}^{\\mathrm{CBS}} + \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{R}}}{n^p} \\right)\n$$\nBy the linearity of the operation, we can rearrange the terms to separate the CBS components from the error components:\n$$\nB(n) \\approx (E_{\\mathrm{TS}}^{\\mathrm{CBS}} - E_{\\mathrm{R}}^{\\mathrm{CBS}}) + \\left( \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{TS}}}{n^p} - \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{R}}}{n^p} \\right)\n$$\nRecognizing that the first term is the CBS barrier height, $B^{\\mathrm{CBS}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nB(n) \\approx B^{\\mathrm{CBS}} + \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{TS}} - A_{\\mathrm{R}}}{n^p}\n$$\nThe error in the barrier height, $\\Delta B(n)$, is the difference between the computed value $B(n)$ and the true value $B^{\\mathrm{CBS}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta B(n) = B(n) - B^{\\mathrm{CBS}}\n$$\nFrom our derived expression for $B(n)$, we obtain the final formula for the leading-order barrier height error:\n$$\n\\Delta B(n) \\approx \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{TS}} - A_{\\mathrm{R}}}{n^p}\n$$\nThis result is fundamental. It shows that the error in an energy difference converges with the same power law as the individual energies, but its magnitude is governed by the *difference* in the proportionality constants, $A_{\\mathrm{TS}} - A_{\\mathrm{R}}$. This implies that if the basis-set error is similar for the reactant and the transition state (i.e., $A_{\\mathrm{TS}} \\approx A_{\\mathrm{R}}$), a fortuitous cancellation of errors can occur, leading to a smaller error in the barrier height than in the individual energies.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the specific methods given in the problem.\nFor conventional CCSD(T), the exponent is $p = 3$:\n$$\n\\Delta B_{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)}}(n) \\approx \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{TS}} - A_{\\mathrm{R}}}{n^3}\n$$\nFor the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b method, which is designed to better model the electron-electron cusp and thus exhibits much faster convergence, the exponent is $p_{\\mathrm{F12}} = 6$:\n$$\n\\Delta B_{\\mathrm{CCSD(T)-F12b}}(n) \\approx \\frac{A^{\\mathrm{F12}}_{\\mathrm{TS}} - A^{\\mathrm{F12}}_{\\mathrm{R}}}{n^6}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to perform a numerical analysis for the provided test suite. The program below implements the calculation of the absolute barrier height error, $|\\Delta B(n)|$, for each reaction using these formulas, with cardinal numbers $n=2$ (double-zeta) and $n=3$ (triple-zeta). It then computes and aggregates the twelve specified statistical metrics: the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Maximum Absolute Error (MaxAE) for both methods at both basis set levels, and the fraction of reactions whose absolute error is within the chemical accuracy threshold of $1.0 \\, \\text{kcal/mol}$ ($4.184 \\, \\text{kJ/mol}$).\n\nThe calculations will quantitatively demonstrate the vastly superior performance of the CCSD(T)-F12b method. Due to the $n^{-6}$ error decay, we anticipate that even with a small $n=2$ basis, the F12 method will yield errors that are significantly smaller than those from the conventional CCSD(T) method with a larger $n=3$ basis, which only benefits from an $n^{-3}$ decay.
