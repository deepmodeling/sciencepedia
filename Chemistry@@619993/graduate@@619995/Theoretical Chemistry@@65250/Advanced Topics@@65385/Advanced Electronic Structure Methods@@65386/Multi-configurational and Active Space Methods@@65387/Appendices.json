The dimension, denoted $D(N_{\\text{act}}, n_{\\text{act}}, S)$, is a function of the number of active electrons $N_{\\text{act}}$, the number of active spatial orbitals $n_{\\text{act}}$, and the total spin quantum number $S$. The derivation must proceed from first principles as specified.\n\nFirst, we establish the basis of Slater determinants. A CAS with $n_{\\text{act}}$ spatial orbitals comprises $2n_{\\text{act}}$ spin orbitals: $n_{\\text{act}}$ with spin-up ($\\alpha$, $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$) and $n_{\\text{act}}$ with spin-down ($\\beta$, $m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}$). A Slater determinant for $N_{\\text{act}}$ electrons is constructed by selecting $N_{\\text{act}}$ spin orbitals from this set of $2n_{\\text{act}}$ spin orbitals.\n\nThe projection of the total spin, $M_S$, for any given determinant is determined by the number of $\\alpha$ electrons, $N_\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ electrons, $N_\\beta$:\n$$M_S = \\frac{1}{2}(N_\\alpha - N_\\beta)$$\nThe total number of electrons is fixed:\n$$N_{\\text{act}} = N_\\alpha + N_\\beta$$\nSolving this system of linear equations for $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta$ yields:\n$$N_\\alpha = \\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} + M_S$$\n$$N_\\beta = \\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} - M_S$$\nFor $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta$ to be non-negative integers, $N_{\\text{act}}$ and $2M_S$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe number of ways to construct a Slater determinant with a specific $M_S$ is the number of ways to choose $N_\\alpha$ electrons from the $n_{\\text{act}}$ available $\\alpha$ orbitals, multiplied by the number of ways to choose $N_\\beta$ electrons from the $n_{\\text{act}}$ available $\\beta$ orbitals. This combinatorial count gives the total number of Slater determinants in the $M_S$ sector, which we denote as $d(M_S)$.\n$$d(M_S) = \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{N_\\alpha} \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{N_\\beta} = \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} + M_S} \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} - M_S}$$\nHere, we use the convention that $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$ if $k < 0$ or $k > n$. This ensures that $d(M_S)$ is non-zero only for valid populations.\n\nNext, we relate the number of determinants, $d(M_S)$, to the number of spin-adapted configuration state functions (CSFs). A CSF is an eigenfunction of the total spin squared operator, $\\hat{S}^2$, with eigenvalue $S(S+1)$. A set of CSFs for a given $S$ forms a spin multiplet of dimension $2S+1$, with components corresponding to $M_S = -S, -S+1, \\dots, S$.\n\nLet $D(S)$ be the number of linearly independent CSFs with total spin $S$. This is the quantity we seek. Each of these $D(S)$ spin multiplets contributes one state to each $M_S$ subspace for which $|M_S| \\le S$. Consequently, the space of determinants with a given spin projection $M_S$ is spanned by states belonging to all multiplets with total spin $S' \\ge |M_S|$.\nTherefore, the total number of determinants $d(M_S)$ can be expressed as a sum over the number of CSFs $D(S')$ for all spin quantum numbers $S'$ that can have a projection equal to $M_S$. Assuming, without loss of generality, that $M_S \\ge 0$, this relation is:\n$$d(M_S) = \\sum_{S'=M_S, M_S+1, \\dots} D(S')$$\nThe summation extends over all possible spin values in the system.\n\nTo isolate $D(S)$, we exploit this relationship. Consider the number of determinants for two adjacent $M_S$ values, $M_S=S$ and $M_S=S+1$:\n$$d(S) = D(S) + D(S+1) + D(S+2) + \\dots$$\n$$d(S+1) = \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ D(S+1) + D(S+2) + \\dots$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first directly yields the number of CSFs with total spin $S$:\n$$D(S) = d(S) - d(S+1)$$\nThis fundamental result, derived from the structure of spin multiplets, allows us to compute the desired dimension.\n\nSubstituting our expression for $d(M_S)$ into this equation gives the final closed-form expression for the dimension of the spin-adapted CAS CI space for a total spin $S$:\n$$D(N_{\\text{act}}, n_{\\text{act}}, S) = \\left[ \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} + S} \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} - S} \\right] - \\left[ \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} + S + 1} \\binom{n_{\\text{act}}}{\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} - S - 1} \\right]$$\nThis is the Weyl-Paldus formula, which is the required result.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression for the specific case of a CAS(6,6) system ($N_{\\text{act}} = 6$ electrons in $n_{\\text{act}} = 6$ orbitals) with a total spin $S=0$ (singlet state).\nThe parameters are:\n$$N_{\\text{act}} = 6$$\n$$n_{\\text{act}} = 6$$\n$$S = 0$$\n\nWe first compute the arguments of the binomial coefficients:\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} + S = \\frac{6}{2} + 0 = 3$$\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} - S = \\frac{6}{2} - 0 = 3$$\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} + S + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$$\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{2} - S - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$D(6, 6, 0) = \\binom{6}{3} \\binom{6}{3} - \\binom{6}{4} \\binom{6}{2}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the required binomial coefficients:\n$$\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$$\n$$\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$$\n$$\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dimension:\n$$D(6, 6, 0) = (20) \\times (20) - (15) \\times (15) = 400 - 225 = 175$$\nThe dimension of the singlet ($S=0$) CAS CI space for a CAS(6,6) problem is $175$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{175}$$", "id": "2788750"}, {"introduction": "A crucial skill in computational chemistry is knowing when a simple single-reference model is insufficient and a more sophisticated multi-configurational approach is required.

I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe problem directs us to consider the mixing of two orbitals, $\\phi_p$ and $\\phi_q$, which are candidates for an active space. This is a classic two-level problem. In the basis of these two orbitals, the relevant physics is captured by the $2 \\times 2$ subblock of an effective Hamiltonian. The problem states we should use the generalized Fock matrix $F[\\gamma]$ for this purpose. The subblock is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}^{(pq)} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{pp} & F_{pq} \\\\ F_{qp} & F_{qq} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is Hermitian, $F[\\gamma]$ is also Hermitian, meaning $F_{qp} = F_{pq}^*$. For real-valued orbitals, $F_{qp} = F_{pq}$.\n\nThe new orbitals, $\\phi'_p$ and $\\phi'_q$, that diagonalize this subblock are obtained through a unitary rotation of the original orbitals. For a $2 \\times 2$ real symmetric matrix, this is a simple Jacobi rotation:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi'_p \\\\ \\phi'_q \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_p \\\\ \\phi_q \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe angle of rotation, $\\theta$, is determined by the condition that the corresponding off-diagonal element in the rotated basis is zero. This leads to the standard result:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2 F_{pq}}{F_{qq} - F_{pp}}\n$$\nStrong mixing between orbitals $\\phi_p$ and $\\phi_q$ implies a large rotation angle $\\theta$. Maximum mixing occurs at $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, for which $\\tan(2\\theta) \\to \\infty$. This happens when the denominator $F_{qq} - F_{pp}$ is small (near-degeneracy) compared to the numerator $2 F_{pq}$ (the coupling).\n\nThe problem specifies that the diagnostic should use the HF orbital energy differences, $\\epsilon_q - \\epsilon_p$, as a proxy for the level spacing. This is a reasonable approximation, as the diagonal elements of the generalized Fock matrix can be seen as perturbed HF energies, i.e., $F_{pp} \\approx \\epsilon_p$ and $F_{qq} \\approx \\epsilon_q$. Substituting this approximation into our expression, we get:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) \\approx \\frac{2 F_{pq}}{\\epsilon_q - \\epsilon_p}\n$$\nThe right-hand side of this expression is the quantity that governs the magnitude of orbital mixing. Let us define a dimensionless parameter $\\eta_{pq}$ based on this ratio:\n$$\n\\eta_{pq} = \\frac{2 |F_{pq}|}{|\\epsilon_q - \\epsilon_p|}\n$$\nThis parameter $\\eta_{pq}$ has a clear physical meaning.\n-   If $\\eta_{pq} \\ll 1$, then $2\\theta \\approx \\tan(2\\theta) \\approx \\eta_{pq}$, so the mixing angle $\\theta$ is small. The HF description is stable.\n-   If $\\eta_{pq} \\gtrsim 1$, then $\\tan(2\\theta) \\gtrsim 1$, which implies a significant rotation angle ($2\\theta \\gtrsim \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, or $\\theta \\gtrsim \\frac{\\pi}{8}$). This indicates that the initial orbitals are poorly chosen and significant mixing is required, which is a hallmark of static correlation.\n\nTherefore, $\\eta_{pq}$ itself is a physically motivated, dimensionless diagnostic with a natural threshold of order $O(1)$. To create a single scalar diagnostic for the entire valence window $\\mathcal{W}$, we should identify the most problematic pair of orbitals. This is achieved by taking the maximum value of $\\eta_{pq}$ over all pairs in $\\mathcal{W}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\max} = \\max_{\\substack{p,q\\in \\mathcal{W}\\\\ p<q}} \\frac{2\\,|F_{pq}|}{|\\epsilon_q-\\epsilon_p|}\n$$\nThis construction satisfies all requirements stipulated in the problem statement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Define $\\eta_{\\max} = \\max_{\\substack{p,q\\in \\mathcal{W}\\\\ p<q}} \\frac{2\\,|F_{pq}|}{|\\epsilon_q-\\epsilon_p|}$, and flag multiconfigurational character when $\\eta_{\\max} \\gtrsim 1$.**\nThis expression is identical to the one derived from first principles.\n-   It is dimensionless (energy/energy).\n-   It directly quantifies mixing based on the ratio of coupling to energy spacing.\n-   It uses the specified quantities ($F[\\gamma]$ and $\\epsilon_q-\\epsilon_p$).\n-   It has a natural threshold of $O(1)$ arising from the tangent of the rotation angle.\n-   By taking the maximum over pairs in $\\mathcal{W}$, it isolates the worst-case scenario within the specified window.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Define $S = \\sum_{\\substack{p,q\\in \\mathcal{W}\\\\ p<q}} |F_{pq}|$, and flag multiconfigurational character when $S \\gtrsim 0.1$.**\nThis expression is a simple sum of the magnitudes of the off-diagonal Fock elements.\n-   It is **not dimensionless**. $F_{pq}$ has units of energy, so $S$ has units of energy. This violates a primary requirement.\n-   It ignores the orbital energy differences $(\\epsilon_q - \\epsilon_p)$. A large coupling $|F_{pq}|$ between two orbitals with a very large energy gap does not imply strong mixing. This diagnostic is physically incomplete.\n-   The threshold is not natural; it is an arbitrary value in Hartrees that would depend on the size of the system and the window $\\mathcal{W}$.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Define $D = \\max_{\\substack{i\\in \\text{occ},\\, a\\in \\text{vir}}} \\frac{|F_{ia}|}{\\sqrt{F_{ii}^2+F_{aa}^2}}$, and flag multiconfigurational character when $D \\gtrsim 0.1$.**\nThis expression compares the occupied-virtual coupling to the geometric mean of the diagonal elements.\n-   It is dimensionless.\n-   The denominator $\\sqrt{F_{ii}^2+F_{aa}^2}$ is physically incorrect for diagnosing near-degeneracy. The relevant quantity is the energy *difference* $|F_{aa} - F_{ii}|$, not a norm of the diagonal elements. Two orbitals could be nearly degenerate (e.g., $F_{ii} \\approx F_{aa}$) but have large magnitudes, leading to a large denominator that incorrectly suppresses the diagnostic.\n-   The definition is restricted to occupied-virtual pairs, ignoring potential near-degeneracies between two occupied or two virtual orbitals, which can be crucial for multiconfigurational character (e.g., in transition metal complexes). It does not operate on the specified window $\\mathcal{W}$ which may contain occ-occ or vir-vir pairs.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Define $T = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i\\in \\text{occ}} \\sum_{a\\in \\text{vir}} \\left(\\frac{F_{ia}}{\\epsilon_a-\\epsilon_i}\\right)^2}$, and flag multiconfigurational character when $T \\gtrsim 0.02$.**\nThis expression is the L2-norm of the first-order wavefunction correction amplitudes from perturbation theory, summed over all occupied-virtual pairs. It is related to the T1 diagnostic in coupled-cluster theory.\n-   It is a global diagnostic, summing over all pairs, rather than a maximum-based diagnostic designed to find the single worst-offending pair within a specific window $\\mathcal{W}$. A strong local near-degeneracy could be hidden by the multitude of small contributions.\n-   Its natural threshold is not of order $O(1)$. Experience shows that for this type of diagnostic, values as small as $0.02$ already indicate that a single-reference treatment is questionable. A value of $T \\approx 1$ would signify a catastrophic breakdown, not merely a need for a small active space calculation.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.

It fails to capture the essential physics of the problem.\n-   The proposed threshold of $0.3$ is not naturally derived from first principles in the way that the threshold of $O(1)$ is for Option A.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2788793"}, {"introduction": "Successfully applying multi-configurational methods to describe chemical processes, such as bond dissociation, requires more than just choosing an active space; it demands ensuring the results are physically sound across the entire potential energy surface.

The minimal active space to achieve this is $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$, which includes both the bonding ($\\sigma$) and antibonding ($\\sigma^*$) molecular orbitals. At large internuclear distances, these two molecular orbitals become degenerate and can be linearly combined to form localized atomic orbitals on each fragment. The ground state wavefunction is a linear combination of the configurations $|\\dots \\sigma^2 \\rangle$ and $|\\dots (\\sigma^*)^2 \\rangle$.\n\nA $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,1)$ active space, by definition, contains only one active orbital (the $\\sigma$ orbital) and two active electrons. The only possible configuration for the active electrons is $|\\sigma^2 \\rangle$. At the dissociation limit, this single-determinant wavefunction describes an ionic dissociation, e.g., $\\text{H}_2 \\to \\text{H}^+ + \\text{H}^-$, not the homolytic dissociation to two neutral radicals $\\text{H}^\\bullet + \\text{H}^\\bullet$. The energy of the ionic products is significantly higher than that of the radical products. Therefore, the calculated energy $E(A{+}B)$ at the $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,1)$ level does not equal the sum of the energies of the individual radical fragments, $E(A) + E(B)$. The method is not size-consistent with this active space. The argument regarding the later addition of dynamic correlation is irrelevant; size-consistency is a property required of the reference wavefunction itself for describing bond dissociation correctly.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For an MCSCF wavefunction, if the active orbital space $\\mathcal{A}$ at $R \\to \\infty$ can be partitioned as a direct sum $\\mathcal{A}=\\mathcal{A}_{A}\\oplus \\mathcal{A}_{B}$ such that the Slater determinant basis factorizes and all one- and two-electron inter-fragment integrals vanish, then the variational minimum delivers $E_{AB}=E_{A}+E_{B}$, that is, size-consistency holds under these conditions.**\n\nThis statement provides a formal set of conditions for size-consistency within the MCSCF framework. At infinite separation ($R \\to \\infty$), the Hamiltonian becomes a sum of non-interacting fragment Hamiltonians, $\\hat{H}_{AB} = \\hat{H}_A + \\hat{H}_B$, and all integrals involving basis functions on both fragments vanish. If the active space $\\mathcal{A}$ can be partitioned into subspaces $\\mathcal{A}_A$ and $\\mathcal{A}_B$ that are localized on fragments $A$ and $B$ respectively, then the full CI space within $\\mathcal{A}$ becomes a tensor product of the CI spaces within $\\mathcal{A}_A$ and $\\mathcal{A}_B$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the variational optimization of the total energy $E_{AB} = \\langle \\Psi_{AB} | \\hat{H}_A + \\hat{H}_B | \\Psi_{AB} \\rangle$ decouples into two independent variational problems, one for each fragment. The optimal total wavefunction $\\Psi_{AB}$ becomes a simple product of the optimal fragment wavefunctions, $\\Psi_{AB} = \\Psi_A \\otimes \\Psi_B$, where $\\Psi_A$ and $\\Psi_B$ are the ground state wavefunctions for fragments $A$ and $B$ determined within their respective active subspaces. The total energy is then $E_{AB} = \\langle \\Psi_A | \\hat{H}_A | \\Psi_A \\rangle + \\langle \\Psi_B | \\hat{H}_B | \\Psi_B \\rangle = E_A + E_B$. The statement correctly formalizes the conditions under which an MCSCF calculation is size-consistent.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Keeping the same active-space dimension $m$ (number of active orbitals) and the same active electron count $n$ at every geometry is necessary and sufficient to avoid root flipping and discontinuities in the potential energy curve.**\n\nMaintaining a constant active space definition ($n$ electrons in $m$ orbitals) is a **necessary** condition for defining a consistent potential energy surface (PES). Changing the model chemistry ($n$ or $m$) from one point to the next would introduce artificial seams and discontinuities by definition.\n\nHowever, this condition is by no means **sufficient**. Even with a fixed active space, at least two major problems can lead to discontinuities or unphysical behavior:\n1.  **Root Flipping**: The CASSCF procedure variationally minimizes the energy. If two electronic states become close in energy or cross, the character of the $k$-th root (e.g., the ground state, $k=1$) can change abruptly. The calculation at geometry $R_i$ might converge on one state, while at the next geometry $R_{i+1}$ it converges on another state that has become lower in energy. This jump between electronic states of different character leads to a discontinuity in the PES.\n2.  **Orbital Space Rotation**: The identity of the orbitals in the active space can change. The optimization algorithm can swap an intended active orbital (e.g., $\\sigma^*$) with a virtual orbital of similar symmetry and energy, leading to a converged solution that is physically different from the one at the previous geometry. This also causes discontinuities or sharp, unphysical kinks in the PES.\n\nTherefore, while necessary, keeping $n$ and $m$ constant is not sufficient. The assertion of sufficiency is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A practical way to maintain consistent active orbitals along the coordinate is to use state-averaged CASSCF over a set of relevant states combined with maximum-overlap tracking of the active subspace between successive geometries.**\n\nThis statement proposes a combination of two standard, powerful techniques designed to overcome the insufficiency described in the analysis of statement C.\n1.  **State-Averaged (SA) CASSCF**: This method optimizes a single set of molecular orbitals for a weighted average of several electronic states. Near (avoided) crossings, this provides a balanced description of all interacting states, preventing the orbitals from biasing towards only the lowest-energy state at that specific geometry. This is the primary tool for generating smooth and continuous PESs for multiple states and for mitigating root flipping.\n2.  **Maximum-Overlap Tracking**: To prevent the orbital space from rotating to a physically distinct solution, one can enforce continuity by choosing the orbital set at geometry $R_{i+1}$ that has the maximum overlap with the orbital set from the previous geometry $R_i$. This ensures that the qualitative character of the inactive, active, and virtual subspaces is preserved along the reaction coordinate.\n\nThe combination of these two methods is a widely used and robust strategy in computational chemistry to produce smooth, well-behaved potential energy curves, especially in complex situations involving bond breaking and state crossings.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Localizing the active orbitals on atomic fragments (for example, by Pipek–Mezey localization) at all geometries guarantees size-consistency even if the antibonding counterpart(s) of the bond(s) being broken are excluded from the active space.**\n\nLocalization of orbitals is a unitary transformation performed *within* a given orbital subspace (e.g., the active space). Such a transformation changes the representation of the orbitals but does not change the total energy, the wavefunction, or the vector space spanned by the configuration state functions. If the active space is fundamentally deficient, no unitary transformation can correct it.\n\nAs established in the analysis of statement A, for homolytic cleavage of a $\\sigma$ bond, the exclusion of the $\\sigma^*$ antibonding orbital from the active space leads to an incorrect description of the separated fragments and a failure of size-consistency. The active space is incomplete. Applying a localization procedure to an incomplete active space cannot magically introduce the missing physics. The localization procedure would act on the single $\\sigma$ orbital in a $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,1)$ space, which is a trivial transformation that does not change anything. Size-consistency is determined by the completeness of the CI expansion in the active space, not by the specific representation (canonical vs. localized) of the active orbitals.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. In Restricted Active Space Self-Consistent Field (RASSCF), placing the antibonding orbital in the $\\mathrm{RAS}3$ subspace with an occupation cap of at most $2$ electrons will necessarily break size-consistency for dissociation of a $2$-electron $\\sigma$ bond.**\n\nLet us analyze the required configurations for a size-consistent description of a dissociated $2$-electron $\\sigma$ bond. The minimal CAS description is $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ on the $\\{\\sigma, \\sigma^*\\}$ orbital set, which includes the configurations $|\\dots \\sigma^2 \\rangle$, $|\\dots \\sigma (\\sigma^*) \\rangle$, and $|\\dots (\\sigma^*)^2 \\rangle$. The last configuration, a double excitation into $\\sigma^*$, is crucial for describing the separated fragments correctly.\n\nIn a RASSCF scheme, the orbital space is partitioned into RAS1, RAS2, and RAS3. Let us construct a RASSCF space that mimics the $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$. We can place the $\\sigma$ orbital in RAS2 and the $\\sigma^*$ orbital in RAS3. The 2 active electrons can then be distributed. The definition of RAS3 is a space into which a limited number of electrons can be excited. The statement specifies an \"occupation cap of at most $2$ electrons\" for RAS3. This means that configurations with $0$, $1$, or $2$ electrons in RAS3 are allowed. With $\\sigma^*$ being the sole occupant of RAS3, this allows the configurations:\n-   Zero electrons in $\\sigma^*$ (i.e., electrons are elsewhere, e.g., $|\\sigma^2\\rangle$).\n-   One electron in $\\sigma^*$ (e.g., $|\\sigma^1(\\sigma^*)^1\\rangle$).\n-   Two electrons in $\\sigma^*$ (i.e., $|\\sigma^0(\\sigma^*)^2\\rangle$).\n\nThis set of allowed excitations into RAS3 is precisely what is needed to construct the full configuration space of a $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ calculation. Therefore, such a RASSCF calculation is equivalent to a $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ calculation and will be size-consistent. The statement claims this arrangement will *necessarily break* size-consistency, which is false. Had the occupation cap for RAS3 been set to $1$, then the crucial $|\\dots (\\sigma^*)^2 \\rangle$ configuration would be excluded, and size-consistency would indeed be broken. But a cap of $2$ ensures it.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2788787"}]}
