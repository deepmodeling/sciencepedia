Therefore, any determinant describing a doubly occupied orbital is a pure singlet state.\nSo, two of our singlet CSFs are:\n$^1\\Psi_1 = D_1 = |\\phi_a\\alpha, \\phi_a\\beta|$\n$^1\\Psi_2 = D_2 = |\\phi_b\\alpha, \\phi_b\\beta|$\n\nThe final CSF must be a singlet residing in the subspace spanned by $\\{D_5, D_6\\}$ and must be orthogonal to the triplet function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(D_5 + D_6)$ which also resides in this subspace.

Choosing the standard phase convention where the coefficient of the $|\\dots\\alpha\\beta\\rangle$ determinant is positive, we take $c_5 = +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThis gives the third singlet CSF, corresponding to the singly-occupied configuration $\\phi_a^1 \\phi_b^1$:\n$^1\\Psi_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(D_5 - D_6)$.\n\nThis CSF physically represents a covalent singlet bond, formed by a symmetric spatial combination $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\phi_a(1)\\phi_b(2)+\\phi_b(1)\\phi_a(2))$ and the antisymmetric singlet spin function.\n\nThe problem requires the coefficient row vector for this specific CSF, $^1\\Psi_3$, in the ordered basis $\\{D_{1},D_{2},D_{3},D_{4},D_{5},D_{6}\\}$.\nThe expansion is:\n$^1\\Psi_3 = (0)D_1 + (0)D_2 + (0)D_3 + (0)D_4 + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})D_5 + (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})D_6$.\nThe coefficient row vector is therefore $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2788958"}, {"introduction": "While powerful, truncated Configuration Interaction methods like MR-CISD suffer from a significant theoretical flaw: a lack of size-consistency, meaning the energy of two non-interacting fragments is not equal to the sum of their individual energies.

For a given method $M$, the error is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{M} = E_{M}(AB) - \\left( E_{M}(A) + E_{M}(B) \\right)\n$$\nA value of $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{M} = 0$ indicates perfect size-consistency for the method $M$. We will now apply this formula to the provided test suite. All energies are given in atomic units (Hartree). The computed errors will be reported in the same units, rounded to six decimal places as required.\n\n**Test Case 1**\nFor this case, we are given:\n- MR-CISD: $E_A = -75.120000$, $E_B = -75.120000$, $E_{AB} = -150.235500$.\n- MRCI+Q: $E_A = -75.125500$, $E_B = -75.125500$, $E_{AB} = -150.250400$.\n- MRCI+P: $E_A = -75.126200$, $E_B = -75.126200$, $E_{AB} = -150.252500$.\n\nThe size-consistency errors are calculated as follows:\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MR-CISD}} = -150.235500 - (-75.120000 + -75.120000) = -150.235500 - (-150.240000) = 0.004500$.\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MRCI+Q}} = -150.250400 - (-75.125500 + -75.125500) = -150.250400 - (-150.251000) = 0.000600$.\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MRCI+P}} = -150.252500 - (-75.126200 + -75.126200) = -150.252500 - (-150.252400) = -0.000100$.\n\n**Test Case 2**\nFor this case, we are given:\n- MR-CISD: $E_A = -100.200000$, $E_B = -20.050000$, $E_{AB} = -120.240000$.\n- MRCI+Q: $E_A = -100.205000$, $E_B = -20.052000$, $E_{AB} = -120.256300$.\n- MRCI+P: $E_A = -100.206000$, $E_B = -20.052500$, $E_{AB} = -120.259300$.\n\nThe size-consistency errors are:\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MR-CISD}} = -120.240000 - (-100.200000 + -20.050000) = -120.240000 - (-120.250000) = 0.010000$.\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MRCI+Q}} = -120.256300 - (-100.205000 + -20.052000) = -120.256300 - (-120.257000) = 0.000700$.\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MRCI+P}} = -120.259300 - (-100.206000 + -20.052500) = -120.259300 - (-120.258500) = -0.000800$.\n\n**Test Case 3**\nFor this case, we are given:\n- MR-CISD: $E_A = -1.100000$, $E_B = -0.500000$, $E_{AB} = -1.599700$.\n- MRCI+Q: $E_A = -1.100000$, $E_B = -0.500000$, $E_{AB} = -1.600000$.\n- MRCI+P: $E_A = -1.100000$, $E_B = -0.500000$, $E_{AB} = -1.600100$.\n\nThe size-consistency errors are:\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MR-CISD}} = -1.599700 - (-1.100000 + -0.500000) = -1.599700 - (-1.600000) = 0.000300$.\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MRCI+Q}} = -1.600000 - (-1.100000 + -0.500000) = -1.600000 - (-1.600000) = 0.000000$.\n- $\\Delta E_{\\text{SC}}^{\\text{MRCI+P}} = -1.600100 - (-1.100000 + -0.500000) = -1.600100 - (-1.600000) = -0.000100$.\n\nThese calculations demonstrate the known behavior: uncorrected MR-CISD exhibits a positive size-consistency error. The Davidson (+Q) correction significantly reduces this error, bringing it closer to zero. The Pople (+P) correction can sometimes overcorrect, resulting in a small negative error. In the third case, the Davidson correction achieves perfect size-consistency.
