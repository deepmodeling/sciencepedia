In many non-aqueous systems, simple quasi-reference electrodes (QREs) are convenient, but their potentials can be unstable and 'drift' during an experiment. This thought experiment helps you develop an intuition for how such instability visually manifests in experimental data, such as cyclic voltammograms, and underscores why this issue must be addressed for accurate measurements [@problem_id:1584261].", "problem": "An electrochemistry student is investigating a newly synthesized compound in an acetonitrile solution. The compound is known to undergo a stable and electrochemically reversible one-electron reduction/oxidation process. The student performs a series of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiments, recording five consecutive scans under identical conditions. For a reference electrode, the student uses a simple silver wire, which acts as a quasi-reference electrode. Due to slow reactions with trace impurities in the \"anhydrous\" solvent, the potential of this quasi-reference electrode is known to drift. Between the start of the first scan and the start of the fifth scan, the potential of the silver wire reference electrode, $E_{ref}$, has drifted linearly with time, becoming more positive by a total of $40$ millivolts. All other experimental conditions, including the stability and concentration of the analyte, are considered constant.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements best describes the expected observation when comparing the first CV scan to the fifth CV scan?\n\nA. The formal potential, calculated as the midpoint of the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, will shift by approximately $40$ mV to a more positive value, while the peak-to-peak separation will remain constant.\n\nB.

Both the formal potential and the peak-to-peak separation will remain unchanged, but the peak currents will decrease due to the potential drift.", "solution": "For a reversible one-electron couple in cyclic voltammetry, the anodic and cathodic peak potentials measured versus a reference electrode are related to their absolute potentials by a simple offset due to the reference potential. Let $E_{pa}^{abs}$ and $E_{pc}^{abs}$ be the absolute anodic and cathodic peak potentials of the redox couple (set by the analyte and thermodynamics), and let $E_{ref}^{(i)}$ be the reference electrode potential at the start of scan $i$. The measured peak potentials in scan $i$ are\n$$\nE_{pa}^{(i)}=E_{pa}^{abs}-E_{ref}^{(i)}, \\quad E_{pc}^{(i)}=E_{pc}^{abs}-E_{ref}^{(i)}.\n$$\nThe formal potential measured in scan $i$, defined as the midpoint of the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, is\n$$\nE^{0'(i)}=\\frac{E_{pa}^{(i)}+E_{pc}^{(i)}}{2}=\\frac{E_{pa}^{abs}+E_{pc}^{abs}}{2}-E_{ref}^{(i)}=E^{0'abs}-E_{ref}^{(i)}.\n$$\nTherefore, the change in the measured formal potential between scans $5$ and $1$ is\n$$\n\\Delta E^{0'}=E^{0'(5)}-E^{0'(1)}=-(E_{ref}^{(5)}-E_{ref}^{(1)}).\n$$\nGiven that the quasi-reference potential drifts more positive by $40$ millivolts between the start of the first and the start of the fifth scan, we have $E_{ref}^{(5)}-E_{ref}^{(1)}=+40\\ \\text{mV}$, hence\n$$\n\\Delta E^{0'}=-40\\ \\text{mV},\n$$\nmeaning the measured formal potential shifts to a more negative value by approximately $40$ mV.\n\nNext, the peak-to-peak separation in scan $i$ is\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p}^{(i)}=E_{pa}^{(i)}-E_{pc}^{(i)}=(E_{pa}^{abs}-E_{ref}^{(i)})-(E_{pc}^{abs}-E_{ref}^{(i)})=E_{pa}^{abs}-E_{pc}^{abs}.\n$$\nThus, $\\Delta E_{p}^{(i)}$ is independent of $E_{ref}^{(i)}$ and remains constant across scans. For a reversible one-electron couple, $\\Delta E_{p}$ is determined by fundamental kinetics and mass transport (for an ideal Nernstian system, $\\Delta E_{p}=\\frac{2.218RT}{F}$) and does not change with a uniform reference potential offset.\n\nTherefore, when comparing the first and fifth scans, the formal potential will shift by approximately $40$ mV to a more negative value, while the peak-to-peak separation will remain constant. This corresponds to option B, and rules out options A, C, D, and E: A has the wrong sign for the shift; C and D incorrectly predict a change in peak separation; E incorrectly asserts unchanged potentials and reduced currents, whereas peak currents are unaffected by a simple reference potential drift under constant experimental conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1584261"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the problems caused by a drifting potential, we now turn to the standard solution: using an internal reference standard, as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
