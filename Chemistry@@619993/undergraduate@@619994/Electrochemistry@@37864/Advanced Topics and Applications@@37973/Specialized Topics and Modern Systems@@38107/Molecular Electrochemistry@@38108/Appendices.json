This problem challenges you to analyze voltammograms recorded at different scan rates, connecting experimental observables to fundamental principles [@problem_id:1572570]. You will apply the Randles-Sevcik relationship to understand peak currents and analyze peak separation to gain insights into the kinetics of electron transfer, moving from ideal theory to the realities of a quasi-reversible system.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is conducting an electrochemical experiment to study a classic organometallic compound, ferrocene (Fc), which undergoes a one-electron oxidation to the ferrocenium cation (Fc$^+$). The student uses a technique called Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), where the potential of a working electrode is ramped linearly versus time. Two separate experiments, labeled Experiment X and Experiment Y, are performed on identical ferrocene solutions under the same conditions, with the only difference being the scan rate of the applied potential. The two scan rates used are 100 mV/s and 400 mV/s.\n\nThe student records the anodic peak current ($i_{p,a}$), the cathodic peak current ($i_{p,c}$), and the potential separation between these peaks ($\\Delta E_p = |E_{p,a} - E_{p,c}|$). The key observations are:\n1.  The magnitude of the peak currents (both anodic and cathodic) measured in Experiment Y is approximately double the magnitude of the peak currents measured in Experiment X.\n2.  The peak-to-peak separation measured in Experiment Y ($\\Delta E_{p,Y}$) is noticeably larger than the separation measured in Experiment X ($\\Delta E_{p,X}$).\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements correctly identifies the scan rates for each experiment and provides the correct electrochemical reasoning?\n\nA. Experiment Y was run at 100 mV/s. A slower scan rate allows more time for the redox reaction to occur at the electrode surface, resulting in a larger peak current. The larger peak separation is due to slower electrode kinetics at this scan rate.\n\nB. Experiment Y was run at 400 mV/s. Peak current is directly proportional to the scan rate, hence a 4x increase in scan rate should lead to a 4x increase in current, which is close to the observation. The larger peak separation is unexpected and likely due to experimental error.\n\nC. Experiment Y was run at 400 mV/s. This is because peak current is proportional to the square root of the scan rate, and a 4x increase in scan rate results in a $\\sqrt{4}=2$ times increase in current. The larger peak separation indicates that the redox process is quasi-reversible, where kinetic limitations become more apparent at faster scan rates.\n\nD. Experiment X was run at 400 mV/s. A faster scan rate does not allow the diffusion layer to fully develop, resulting in a smaller peak current. The smaller peak separation at this faster scan rate indicates the system is behaving more ideally.\n\nE. It is impossible to determine which scan rate corresponds to which experiment without knowing the concentration of the ferrocene solution and the area of the working electrode.", "solution": "We model Fc/Fc^{+} as a diffusion-controlled, one-electron process interrogated by cyclic voltammetry. For a reversible redox couple at a planar electrode under semi-infinite linear diffusion, the Randles–Sevcik relation gives the peak current as\n$$\ni_{p}=\\beta\\, n F A C \\left(\\frac{n F D v}{R T}\\right)^{1/2},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $A$ is electrode area, $C$ is bulk concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $v$ is the scan rate, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $\\beta$ is a dimensionless constant for a reversible system. This implies the proportionality\n$$\ni_{p}\\propto v^{1/2}.\n$$\nTherefore, for two experiments X and Y performed on the same solution with identical $A$, $C$, $D$, and $T$,\n$$\n\\frac{i_{p,Y}}{i_{p,X}}=\\left(\\frac{v_{Y}}{v_{X}}\\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nThe observation that $i_{p,Y}\\approx 2\\, i_{p,X}$ gives\n$$\n2\\approx \\left(\\frac{v_{Y}}{v_{X}}\\right)^{1/2}\\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\;\\frac{v_{Y}}{v_{X}}\\approx 4.\n$$\nGiven the only available scan rates are $100$ mV/s and $400$ mV/s (a factor of $4$), Experiment Y must be the faster scan, $v_{Y}=400$ mV/s, and Experiment X the slower scan, $v_{X}=100$ mV/s.\n\nNext, consider the peak-to-peak separation. For a reversible couple, the peak separation is independent of scan rate and equals\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p}^{\\mathrm{rev}}=c\\,\\frac{R T}{n F},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a numerical constant characteristic of reversible CV. Thus, if the system were fully reversible over this scan-range, $\\Delta E_{p}$ would not increase with $v$. The observation that $\\Delta E_{p,Y}>\\Delta E_{p,X}$ indicates kinetic limitations that become more pronounced at higher scan rate, i.e., quasi-reversible behavior. In the Nicholson treatment of quasi-reversible CV, the dimensionless kinetic parameter\n$$\n\\psi \\propto \\frac{k^{0}}{v^{1/2}},\n$$\nwith $k^{0}$ the standard heterogeneous rate constant, decreases as $v$ increases, producing larger $\\Delta E_{p}$. Therefore, the larger peak separation at the faster scan is expected for a quasi-reversible process.\n\nThese two observations together (a twofold increase in peak current for a fourfold increase in scan rate, and an increased peak separation at the faster scan) uniquely support that Experiment Y was run at $400$ mV/s and that the system exhibits quasi-reversible kinetics at the higher scan rate. This corresponds to option C. The other options contradict $i_{p}\\propto v^{1/2}$, incorrectly attribute larger currents to slower scans, or dismiss the increased $\\Delta E_{p}$ as error rather than a known kinetic effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1572570"}]}
