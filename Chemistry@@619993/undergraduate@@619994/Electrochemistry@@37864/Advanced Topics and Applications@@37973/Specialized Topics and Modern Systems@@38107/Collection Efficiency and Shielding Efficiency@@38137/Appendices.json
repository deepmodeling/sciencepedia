The experiment uses a solution containing ferrocene (Fc), a stable redox species that undergoes a one-electron transfer. A chronoamperometric experiment is performed where the potential of the disk electrode is stepped to a value that ensures the oxidation of ferrocene to ferrocenium ($Fc \\rightarrow Fc^+$) is limited purely by mass transport. Simultaneously, the potential of the concentric ring electrode is held at a value that causes the immediate and complete reduction of any ferrocenium ions that are swept outward from the disk ($Fc^+ \\rightarrow Fc$). After the initial transient response, the system reaches a steady state. The steady-state diffusion-limited current at the disk ($I_D$) is measured to be $-0.158$ milliamperes, and the corresponding steady-state limiting current at the ring ($I_R$) is measured to be $37.6$ microamperes.

This practice will allow you to quantify the effect of a competing chemical reaction, demonstrating how the RRDE serves as a powerful tool for investigating reaction mechanisms and kinetics.", "problem": "An electrochemist is investigating the stability of a reactive intermediate species, R, using a Rotating Ring-Disk Electrode (RRDE). The experiment is designed as follows: At the disk electrode, a stable precursor P is reduced to the reactive species R. The disk potential is held at a value such that this reaction is diffusion-limited, producing a steady-state current $I_D = -125.0 \\text{ µA}$. The ring electrode is held at a potential that re-oxidizes any species R reaching it back to the precursor P, also under diffusion-limited conditions. In the absence of any side reactions, the theoretical collection efficiency of this particular RRDE setup, which depends only on its geometry, is known to be $N_0 = 0.240$.\n\nThe experiment is conducted in a solution containing a scavenger molecule, S, which is electrochemically inactive at the applied potentials but chemically reacts with and consumes the intermediate R as it travels from the disk to the ring.
