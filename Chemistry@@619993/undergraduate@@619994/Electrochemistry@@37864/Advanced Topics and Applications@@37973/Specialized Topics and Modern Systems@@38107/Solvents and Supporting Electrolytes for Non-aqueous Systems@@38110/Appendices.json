This practice problem [@problem_id:1588827] challenges you to think like an experimentalist, weighing factors such as the electrochemical potential window against viscosity to select the optimal solvent for studying a reaction at a very negative potential. Successfully navigating this choice is fundamental to ensuring your species of interest can be observed at all.", "problem": "An electrochemist is planning a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment to investigate the reduction of a newly synthesized organometallic compound. The compound is air-sensitive but known to be soluble in both acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The supporting electrolyte, tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate ($\\text{TBAPF}_6$), is also soluble in both solvents. The electrochemist needs to choose a solvent that will allow them to observe the reduction process, which is anticipated to occur at a very negative potential. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment to guide the solvent choice for this specific experiment?\n\nA. Acetonitrile should be chosen because its lower viscosity will result in a larger diffusion-limited current, making the reduction wave easier to detect.\n\nB. Dimethyl sulfoxide should be chosen because its higher dielectric constant will better solvate the supporting electrolyte, completely eliminating any uncompensated resistance.\n\nC. Acetonitrile is preferable because it has a significantly wider electrochemical potential window, especially in the negative direction, compared to dimethyl sulfoxide.\n\nD. Dimethyl sulfoxide is the more suitable choice because it typically provides access to more negative potentials before the solvent itself is reduced, which is crucial for studying reductions, even though its higher viscosity will result in a smaller current signal compared to acetonitrile.\n\nE. Since the analyte and electrolyte are soluble in both, either solvent can be used with identical results, and the choice is merely one of convenience.", "solution": "To choose a solvent for observing a very negative reduction in cyclic voltammetry, the governing considerations are: (i) the electrochemical potential window (especially the cathodic limit before solvent reduction), (ii) the magnitude of the diffusion-limited current (which affects detectability), and (iii) solution resistance and uncompensated resistance effects.\n\nFirst, the electrochemical window is defined by the onset potentials at which the solvent (or supporting electrolyte) undergoes oxidation or reduction. For a reduction process occurring at a very negative potential, the crucial requirement is that the solvent must remain stable to reduction at potentials more negative than the analyte’s reduction potential. Empirically, among common aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DMSO typically allows access to more negative cathodic potentials before solvent breakdown than ACN. Therefore, DMSO generally provides a wider cathodic window than ACN, which is decisive when the target reduction is very negative.\n\nSecond, the peak current in a reversible CV is governed (in its scaling) by the Randles–Sevcik relationship,\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto n^{\\frac{3}{2}} F A C \\sqrt{\\frac{v D}{R T}},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, $A$ is electrode area, $C$ is analyte concentration, $v$ is scan rate, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is temperature, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient $D$ scales inversely with solvent viscosity $\\eta$ via the Stokes–Einstein relation (for spherical solutes),\n$$\nD \\propto \\frac{k_{B} T}{\\eta r},\n$$\nwith $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant and $r$ an effective hydrodynamic radius. Since ACN has a much lower viscosity than DMSO, $D$ is larger in ACN, leading to larger $i_{p}$ in ACN than in DMSO. Thus, statement A is correct in its premise about larger current in ACN but it does not address the dominant constraint: if the solvent reduces before the analyte, the target wave cannot be observed regardless of current magnitude. Hence A is not the most accurate guidance for this experiment.\n\nThird, regarding solution resistance, the potential at the working electrode differs from the potentiostat setpoint due to uncompensated resistance $R_{u}$ via\n$$\nE_{\\text{electrode}} = E_{\\text{applied}} - i R_{u}.\n$$\nA higher dielectric constant generally improves ion dissociation, but it does not eliminate $R_{u}$; moreover, ionic conductivity depends strongly on viscosity and ion mobility, and higher viscosity tends to increase resistance. Therefore, statement B is incorrect: higher dielectric constant in DMSO does not “completely eliminate” uncompensated resistance.\n\nFourth, the claim that ACN has a significantly wider electrochemical potential window “especially in the negative direction” than DMSO (statement C) is not generally accurate; DMSO is typically favored for access to more negative cathodic limits compared to ACN, which is precisely what matters for observing very negative reductions.\n\nFifth, statement E is incorrect because even though both solvents dissolve the analyte and electrolyte, they do not yield identical results: differences in electrochemical window, viscosity (affecting $D$ and thus $i_{p}$), and conductivity lead to different achievable potentials and signal magnitudes.\n\nCombining these principles, the most accurate assessment for selecting a solvent to study a very negative reduction is that DMSO is more suitable due to its typically more negative cathodic limit, even though its higher viscosity reduces the diffusion-limited current compared to ACN.

To investigate the effects of the solvent environment on molecular transport, a second experiment is conducted using benzonitrile (BN), a more viscous solvent.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume that the temperature is identical for both experiments and that the ferrocene molecule can be modeled as a rigid sphere with a constant effective hydrodynamic radius.
