The QCM measures changes in its resonant frequency, $\\Delta f$, which are related to changes in mass on its surface. The experiment is conducted in an aggressive acidic environment.\n\nTwo competing processes are observed to affect the total mass sensed by the QCM over time, $t$:\n1.  **Etching:** The copper film is uniformly etched away, causing a mass loss. The rate of this mass loss is modeled as a constant, $-k_1$, where $k_1 > 0$.\n2.  **Solvent Trapping:** As the etching proceeds, the surface becomes progressively rougher.

It is a quadratic function of time, $t$. Since the coefficient of the $t^2$ term, $-\\frac{1}{2} C_f k_2$, is negative (as $C_f > 0$ and $k_2 > 0$), the function represents a downward-opening parabola.\n\nLet's check the behavior at key points:\n1.  **At $t=0$**: $\\Delta f(0) = C_f k_1 (0) - \\frac{1}{2} C_f k_2 (0)^2 = 0$. The process starts with zero frequency shift, as stated.\n2.  **Initial behavior (small $t$)**: For very small $t$, the linear term $C_f k_1 t$ dominates the quadratic term. Since $C_f > 0$ and $k_1 > 0$, the initial slope is positive. Thus, $\\Delta f$ initially increases from zero. This corresponds to the initial phase where mass loss from etching is the dominant effect.\n3.  **Maximum frequency shift**: The frequency shift will reach a maximum when its derivative with respect to time is zero.\n    $$ \\frac{d(\\Delta f)}{dt} = C_f k_1 - C_f k_2 t $$\n    Setting the derivative to zero:\n    $$ C_f k_1 - C_f k_2 t_{max} = 0 \\implies t_{max} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2} $$\n    Since $k_1 > 0$ and $k_2 > 0$, there is a positive time at which the frequency shift reaches a maximum. The value of this maximum is positive because it occurs at $t > 0$ and the function started by increasing from zero.\n4.  **Long-term behavior ($t > t_{max}$)**: For times greater than $t_{max}$, the derivative $\\frac{d(\\Delta f)}{dt}$ is negative. This means the frequency shift starts to decrease. The effect of apparent mass gain from solvent trapping is now overcoming the effect of mass loss from etching.\n5.  **Crossing zero**: The frequency shift will return to zero when $\\Delta f(t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n    $$ C_f k_1 t - \\frac{1}{2} C_f k_2 t^2 = 0 $$\n    $$ t \\left(C_f k_1 - \\frac{1}{2} C_f k_2 t \\right) = 0 $$\n    This gives two solutions, $t=0$ and $t = \\frac{2 C_f k_1}{C_f k_2} = \\frac{2k_1}{k_2}$.\n    So, after reaching its maximum at $t = k_1/k_2$, the frequency shift decreases, passing through zero again at $t = 2k_1/k_2$.\n6.  **For $t > 2k_1/k_2$**: The quadratic term dominates and is negative, so $\\Delta f(t)$ becomes negative. A negative frequency shift corresponds to a net mass gain relative to the initial state at $t=0$.\n\nIn summary, the frequency shift $\\Delta f$ starts at zero, increases to a positive maximum, then decreases, passes through zero, and continues to become more negative.\n\nThis behavior is described by option D. Let's analyze the other options:\nA. Incorrect. This would happen if only etching occurred ($\\Delta f(t) = C_f k_1 t$).\nB. Incorrect. This is the inverse behavior, corresponding to a rapid initial mass gain followed by a slower mass loss.\nC. Incorrect. This would imply the net rate of mass change approaches zero, leading to a constant mass and thus constant frequency shift. This is not what our model predicts.\nE. Incorrect. This would require $-k_1 + k_2 t = 0$ for all $t$, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the frequency shift initially increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases, eventually becoming negative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1598079"}]}
