This exercise [@problem_id:1574662] explores the consequences of using an insufficient concentration, helping you develop the crucial skill of diagnosing non-ideal voltammograms by understanding the physical effects of ohmic drop and ion migration.", "problem": "An electrochemistry student is performing a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment to study the redox behavior of ferrocene (Fc) in an acetonitrile solvent. The ferrocene/ferrocenium ($Fc/Fc^+$) couple is known to undergo a chemically and electrochemically reversible, one-electron transfer process. The student aims to use a standard three-electrode setup with a glassy carbon working electrode.\n\nThe student prepares two solutions:\n- **Solution A:** Contains 1.0 mM of ferrocene and a high concentration of supporting electrolyte, 0.1 M Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6). This concentration is considered sufficient to ensure high conductivity and suppress ion migration.\n- **Solution B:** Contains 1.0 mM of ferrocene but an unusually low, insufficient concentration of the supporting electrolyte, 0.1 mM TBAPF6.\n\nAssuming all other experimental parameters (e.g., temperature, scan rate, electrode geometry) are identical for the CV scans of both solutions, how will the shape of the voltammogram obtained from Solution B most likely differ from the ideal voltammogram obtained from Solution A?\n\nA. The peak potentials for the anodic and cathodic scans will be much farther apart, and the peaks will appear broader and less sharp.\n\nB.

The redox peaks for ferrocene will completely disappear, resulting in a flat line characteristic of only the solvent.\n\nE. The peak currents will increase dramatically by several orders of magnitude, while the peak separation remains unchanged.", "solution": "We first recall the ideal, diffusion-controlled, Nernstian response expected for a chemically and electrochemically reversible, one-electron couple at a planar electrode with sufficient supporting electrolyte. Under these conditions, migration is suppressed and mass transport is dominated by diffusion. The peak current scales as\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto n F A C \\left(\\frac{n F v D}{R T}\\right)^{1/2},\n$$\nand the peak-to-peak separation for a reversible one-electron process is small and scan-rate independent, with magnitude on the order of $\\frac{R T}{n F}$. The anodic and cathodic peaks are sharp and symmetric, and $|i_{p,a}| \\approx |i_{p,c}|$.\n\nSupporting electrolyte plays two critical roles:\n- It raises the solution conductivity $\\kappa$ (thus lowering uncompensated resistance) and screens the electric field so that the potential gradient is small in the bulk and migration is negligible; this leaves diffusion as the dominant transport mode.\n- It maintains electroneutrality and stabilizes the double layer, which contributes to well-defined, sharp peaks with small peak separation.\n\nConsider now Solution B with insufficient supporting electrolyte. Two non-ideal effects arise.\n\n1) Migration is no longer negligible. The full Nernstâ€“Planck flux for species $i$ is\n$$\nJ_{i} = -D_{i} \\nabla C_{i} - z_{i} u_{i} F C_{i} \\nabla \\phi + C_{i} \\mathbf{v},\n$$\nwith convection negligible in a quiescent CV. In the Fc/Fc$^{+}$ couple, Fc is neutral while Fc$^{+}$ is positively charged. With a nonzero $\\nabla \\phi$ (due to low ionic strength and poor screening), the migration term drives Fc$^{+}$ in the electric field, altering its interfacial concentration relative to the diffusion-only case. During the return (cathodic) scan, migration tends to draw Fc$^{+}$ away from the electrode, diminishing and broadening the cathodic peak and upsetting the symmetry expected for a reversible couple. The overall result is peak distortion and loss of sharpness.\n\n2) The solution resistance is high, producing a significant uncompensated $i R$ drop. The interfacial potential that controls electron transfer is related to the applied potential by\n$$\nE_{\\text{int}} = E_{\\text{app}} - i R_{u},\n$$\nwith $R_{u}$ large when $\\kappa$ is small. Because the current reverses sign between the anodic and cathodic scans, the $i R_{u}$ drop shifts the observed anodic peak to more positive potentials and the observed cathodic peak to more negative potentials. Consequently, the measured peak separation increases, and the peaks appear broadened, since $i R$ distortion spreads the current over a wider potential range.\n\nThese effects do not produce a simple uniform potential shift of the entire voltammogram; instead, they increase peak separation and degrade peak sharpness. They also do not cause orders-of-magnitude increases in current; if anything, peak currents are often reduced or distorted due to less efficient mass transport for the charged product and ohmic losses. The peaks do not vanish entirely under the stated conditions.\n\nTherefore, relative to the ideal voltammogram from Solution A, the voltammogram from Solution B will have significantly increased peak separation and broader, less sharp peaks.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A: Consistent with migration and $i R$-drop effects.\n- B: Opposite of the expected behavior.\n- C: Incorrect; the distortion is not a uniform shift but an increased separation with broadening.\n- D: Too extreme for the stated conditions.\n- E: Incorrect; currents do not increase by several orders of magnitude and peak separation is not unchanged.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1574662"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple electron transfers, cyclic voltammetry is a powerful tool for unraveling complex reaction mechanisms where chemical steps are coupled to electrochemical events.
