Its properties are achieved by introducing a controlled number of defects into the crystal lattice of zirconia (ZrO₂). This process involves doping with yttria (Y₂O₃). In the YSZ crystal structure, trivalent yttrium cations (Y³⁺) substitute for tetravalent zirconium cations (Zr⁴⁺) on the cation sublattice. To preserve overall charge neutrality in the crystal, this substitution is compensated by the creation of oxygen vacancies. An oxygen vacancy is a lattice site where a divalent oxygen anion (O²⁻) is missing, resulting in a net effective positive charge at that site.\n\nConsider a sample of YSZ prepared with a doping level of 8.00 mol% Y₂O₃. This percentage is defined relative to the total moles of oxides, meaning a mixture of 8.00 moles of Y₂O₃ and 92.00 moles of ZrO₂. Assuming that all dopant atoms are incorporated substitutionally into the zirconia lattice and that charge compensation occurs exclusively through the formation of oxygen vacancies, calculate the mole fraction of oxygen vacancies on the anion sublattice. The anion sublattice consists of all sites available to oxygen anions.\n\nExpress your final answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the mole fraction of oxygen vacancies in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) doped with 8.00 mol% Y₂O₃. This mole fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of vacant anion sites to the total number of moles of anion sites.\n\nStep 1: Establish a basis for calculation.\nLet's consider a total of 100.00 moles of the initial oxide mixture used to create the YSZ ceramic. According to the problem statement, a doping level of 8.00 mol% Y₂O₃ means this mixture contains:\n- 8.00 moles of Y₂O₃\n- 92.00 moles of ZrO₂\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of moles of each cation.\nFrom the basis amounts, we can find the number of moles of each type of cation that will be present in the final crystal lattice.\n- Moles of Y³⁺ cations = 2 × (moles of Y₂O₃) = 2 × 8.00 mol = 16.00 mol\n- Moles of Zr⁴⁺ cations = 1 × (moles of ZrO₂) = 1 × 92.00 mol = 92.00 mol\nThe total number of moles of cations in the lattice is the sum of the moles of Y³⁺ and Zr⁴⁺:\nTotal moles of cations = 16.00 mol + 92.00 mol = 108.00 mol\n\nStep 3: Apply the principle of charge neutrality to find the number of oxygen vacancies.\nIn the original ZrO₂ lattice, each Zr⁴⁺ cation site is compensated by two O²⁻ anions. When a trivalent Y³⁺ ion substitutes for a tetravalent Zr⁴⁺ ion, there is a charge deficit of -1 at the cation site. To maintain overall electroneutrality, the crystal lattice creates positively charged defects. The problem states that this compensation occurs by forming oxygen vacancies. An oxygen vacancy (often denoted V_O^••) corresponds to a missing O²⁻ anion, which leaves behind an effective charge of +2 at that site.\n\nLet $n_{V_O}$ be the number of moles of oxygen vacancies.\nThe total effective negative charge introduced by the substitution of all Y³⁺ ions for Zr⁴⁺ ions is:\nTotal negative charge = (moles of Y³⁺) × (charge difference) = 16.00 mol × (3 - 4) = -16.00 molar units of charge.\n\nThe total effective positive charge introduced by the oxygen vacancies is:\nTotal positive charge = (moles of vacancies) × (effective charge of a vacancy) = $n_{V_O}$ × (+2).\n\nFor charge neutrality, the magnitude of the total positive effective charge must equal the magnitude of the total negative effective charge:\n$2 \\times n_{V_O} = 16.00 \\text{ mol}$\nSolving for the number of moles of oxygen vacancies:\n$n_{V_O} = \\frac{16.00 \\text{ mol}}{2} = 8.00 \\text{ mol}$\n\nStep 4: Determine the total number of anion sites in the lattice.\nThe YSZ crystal adopts a structure related to the fluorite (CaF₂) structure of ZrO₂, where the ratio of cation sites to anion sites is 1:2. Therefore, the total number of anion sites is twice the total number of cation sites.\nFrom Step 2, the total moles of cations is 108.00 mol.\nTotal moles of anion sites = 2 × (Total moles of cations) = 2 × 108.00 mol = 216.00 mol.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the mole fraction of oxygen vacancies.\nThe mole fraction of oxygen vacancies, $X_{V_O}$, is the ratio of the moles of vacancies to the total moles of anion sites.\n$X_{V_O} = \\frac{\\text{moles of oxygen vacancies}}{\\text{total moles of anion sites}}$\n$X_{V_O} = \\frac{n_{V_O}}{\\text{Total moles of anion sites}} = \\frac{8.00 \\text{ mol}}{216.00 \\text{ mol}}$\n\n$X_{V_O} = \\frac{8}{216} = \\frac{1}{27}$\n\nStep 6: Convert to a decimal and round to the specified precision.\nNow, we convert the fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$X_{V_O} = \\frac{1}{27} \\approx 0.037037037...$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$X_{V_O} \\approx 0.0370$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0370}$$", "id": "1542492"}, {"introduction": "The presence of charge carriers is only the first step; their mobility is what determines conductivity.
