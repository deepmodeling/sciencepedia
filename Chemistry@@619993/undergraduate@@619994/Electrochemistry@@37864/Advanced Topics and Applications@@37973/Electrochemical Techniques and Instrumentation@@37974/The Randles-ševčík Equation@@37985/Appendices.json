The student systematically varies the scan rate, $v$, and records the resulting anodic peak current, $i_p$, for each scan.\n\nAccording to the theory for a simple, reversible electrochemical reaction where the reactant reaches the electrode via diffusion from the bulk solution, the peak current should follow the Randles-Ševčík equation, which predicts that $i_p$ is proportional to the square root of the scan rate, i.e., $i_p \\propto v^{1/2}$.\n\nHowever, upon plotting the experimental data, the student finds a clear linear relationship between the peak current and the scan rate, i.e., $i_p \\propto v$.

The key signature is the $v^{1/2}$ dependence arising from semi-infinite diffusion (Fickian transport).\n\nThe observation $i_{p} \\propto v$ indicates a different control regime. A well-known case is a surface-confined (adsorption-controlled) redox process. If the redox-active species is strongly adsorbed on the electrode surface with surface coverage $\\Gamma$ (in mol per unit area) and behaves reversibly (Nernstian equilibrium at the surface), the peak current in cyclic voltammetry scales linearly with the scan rate:\n$$\ni_{p,\\mathrm{ads}} = c_{2}\\,\\frac{n^{2} F^{2} A \\Gamma}{R T}\\,v,\n$$\nwhere $c_{2}$ is a dimensionless numerical constant (for a symmetric reversible wave, $c_{2}$ is of order unity). This linear dependence on $v$ directly matches the experimental finding.\n\nWe now assess the options against the scaling laws:\n\n- Option A (high supporting electrolyte causing ion-pairing): Ion-pairing can change $D$ and effective activity but preserves diffusion-controlled transport. The Randles-Ševčík $i_{p} \\propto v^{1/2}$ scaling remains; only the prefactor changes. Therefore this does not explain $i_{p} \\propto v$.\n\n- Option B (solution stirred by vibrations): Introduction of convection replaces semi-infinite diffusion with convective-diffusive transport toward steady state. In cyclic voltammetry under significant convection, the current approaches a steady-state limiting value set by hydrodynamics and diffusion and is not expected to scale linearly with $v$; it typically becomes weakly dependent on $v$ and the voltammogram becomes sigmoidal rather than showing a diffusion-controlled peak. Hence this does not systematically produce $i_{p} \\propto v$.\n\n- Option C (strong adsorption on the working electrode): As shown above, a surface-confined reversible redox process yields\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto v,\n$$\nconsistent with the observed linear relationship. This is the canonical explanation for $v$-linear peak currents.\n\n- Option D (significant uncompensated resistance, $iR$ drop): Ohmic drop distorts potentials and peak separation, and can attenuate peak heights. However, it does not change the fundamental transport regime from diffusion control to a linear-in-$v$ dependence. The primary $v$-dependence from diffusion ($v^{1/2}$) is not converted to $v^{1}$ solely by $iR$.\n\n- Option E (temperature not at $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$): Temperature enters the prefactors via $D^{1/2}$ and $(R T)^{-1/2}$ for diffusion control and via $(R T)^{-1}$ for adsorption control, modifying only the magnitude, not the exponent of $v$. A different $T$ cannot convert $v^{1/2}$ to $v$.\n\nTherefore, the most likely physical explanation for $i_{p} \\propto v$ is that the redox-active complex is surface-confined (adsorbed) on the electrode, producing an adsorption-controlled response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1597165"}]}
