The experimental setup consists of a standard three-electrode cell connected to a potentiostat. The cell contains a Working Electrode (WE), a Reference Electrode (RE), and a Counter Electrode (CE), all immersed in the solution. The potentiostat is programmed to sweep the potential of the WE over a specific range and record the resulting current that flows through it.\n\nUpon running the experiment, the student observes that the output on the screen, which plots current versus potential, is a perfectly flat horizontal line at exactly zero current for the entire duration of the potential sweep.

The measured current is the WE current, which necessarily flows through the external circuit WE–potentiostat–CE and returns through the solution. Thus, a nonzero current requires a closed current path between WE and CE.\n\nA perfectly flat line at exactly zero current over the entire sweep indicates an open circuit in the current-carrying path. In circuit terms, if the effective resistance between WE and CE is $R \\to \\infty$, then by Ohm’s law,\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\Delta E}{R} \\to 0\n$$\nfor any finite applied potential difference $\\Delta E$. Therefore, an open CE connection (broken or disconnected counter electrode lead) yields identically zero current.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\n- A. Swapping WE and CE: The current path WE–solution–CE remains intact, so current can still flow. The voltammogram may be distorted or inverted, but not identically zero. Hence not consistent with a flat zero line.\n\n- B. Broken or disconnected RE: The feedback loop that controls WE potential is lost. The control amplifier typically drives to compliance, often producing large or erratic currents rather than exactly zero. Not consistent with a flat zero line.\n\n- C.

This produces a nonzero background current (rectangular baseline), not exactly zero. Moreover, the problem states the solution was prepared properly.\n\n- E. Swapping RE and CE: The instrument attempts to reference to a low-impedance CE and drive current through the high-impedance RE. The RE typically has large internal resistance $R_{\\text{RE}}$, so current would be severely limited, but not strictly zero unless the path is effectively open. The control loop also fails, often triggering errors or odd signals rather than a perfect zero line.

The setup consists of a platinum disc as the working electrode (WE), a platinum wire as the counter electrode (CE), and a standard silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode as the reference electrode (RE). The electrodes are immersed in an acidic aqueous electrolyte. The student is using a potentiostat, a device designed to control the potential of the WE relative to the RE while measuring the resulting current that flows between the WE and the CE.\n\nUpon applying a sufficiently positive potential to the WE to drive the OER, the student observes the expected formation of gas bubbles on the surface of the platinum WE. However, they also notice, to their alarm, that gas bubbles are vigorously forming on the silver wire within the glass body of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.

The potentiostat controls the working electrode (WE) potential relative to the reference electrode (RE) while sourcing/sinking current at the counter electrode (CE). The RE input is designed to be of very high impedance so that essentially no current flows through the RE. Therefore, under correct connections, only the WE and CE carry the faradaic current, and no gas evolution should occur inside the RE.\n\n2) Identify the reactions expected during OER in acid. At the WE under sufficiently positive polarization for OER:\n$$\n2\\,H_{2}O \\rightarrow O_{2} + 4\\,H^{+} + 4\\,e^{-}.\n$$\nTo conserve charge, the complementary reduction occurs at the CE (in an acidic electrolyte):\n$$\n4\\,H^{+} + 4\\,e^{-} \\rightarrow 2\\,H_{2}.\n$$\nThus, gas evolution should be observed at the WE (oxygen) and at the CE (hydrogen), but not at the RE, because the RE carries negligible current by design.\n\n3) Interpret the observation of vigorous gas bubble formation on the silver wire inside the Ag/AgCl RE. Gas evolution inside the reference electrode implies that substantial current is being driven through the RE internal element (the Ag wire), which can only occur if the RE is mistakenly connected to the potentiostat’s current-driving terminal (the CE output). In that case, the RE is unintentionally functioning as the CE, and the complementary reaction (e.g., hydrogen evolution in acid) will occur within the reference electrode body, causing bubbles on the Ag wire.\n\n4) Map the wiring error that produces this failure. If the potentiostat leads to the CE and RE are accidentally swapped, the potentiostat measures the potential between WE and what it believes is the RE (now actually connected to the Pt CE wire), and it sources/sinks the current between the WE and what it believes is the CE (now actually the Ag/AgCl RE). As a result, high current passes through the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, driving electrolysis on its internal Ag wire and producing bubbles, exactly as observed.\n\n5) Exclude the other options:\n- Option B (WE and CE swapped): This would cause current to flow between the two Pt electrodes (the one intended as WE and the one intended as CE), but the RE would still be connected to a high-impedance input and would not carry current; no bubbles would form inside the RE.\n- Option C (faulty or miscalibrated RE): A wrong potential reading shifts the potential scale but does not cause the RE to carry current; it does not explain vigorous gas formation inside the RE.\n- Option D (contamination with a reducible species): This could change currents or observed products at WE/CE but cannot force the RE to carry substantial current; again, no gas inside the RE is expected.\n- Option E (applied potential too high): Exceeding the solvent stability window increases gas evolution at WE and CE, not at RE, which remains a high-impedance probe.\n\n6) Conclude that the only option consistent with vigorous gas evolution inside the Ag/AgCl reference electrode is that the CE and RE leads are swapped, causing the reference electrode to act as the current-carrying counter electrode.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1599495"}, {"introduction": "Beyond correct wiring, the physical arrangement of electrodes is crucial for accurate measurements, as the electrolyte solution itself possesses resistance.

Due to a poorly designed cell geometry, the bulky insulating sheath of the reference electrode is positioned directly in front of the center of the planar working electrode's active surface.

The voltammogram will appear distorted, characterized by a significant increase in the separation between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials and a reduction in the peak currents.\n\nB. The placement of the reference electrode will cause its potential to drift, resulting in a continuous, sloping baseline shift in the voltammogram without affecting the peak shapes.\n\nC.

Ionic current flows along field lines between CE and WE through the electrolyte with conductivity $\\kappa$. A local obstruction increases the effective path length and reduces the effective cross-sectional area for current entering the central region, which increases the local resistance. In a homogeneous medium, a representative segment contributes $dR = \\frac{dl}{\\kappa A_{\\perp}}$; the sheath raises the integral $R_{u} = \\int dR$ for current reaching the central WE. As a result:\n- The uncompensated resistance $R_{u}$ increases, so the ohmic drop $i R_{u}$ becomes significant. Because $i$ changes sign between forward and reverse scans, the peaks are displaced in opposite directions. To leading order, the observed peak separation increases approximately as\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p,\\text{obs}} \\approx \\Delta E_{p}^{\\text{rev}} + 2\\, i_{p}\\, R_{u},\n$$\nso the voltammogram exhibits a larger separation between anodic and cathodic peaks than the reversible value.\n- The obstruction also redistributes current density $j(\\boldsymbol{r})$ toward the unobstructed periphery. The central region carries less current due to the elevated local resistance. This current crowding effectively reduces the active area contributing to diffusion-controlled current at a given overpotential, yielding\n$$\ni_{p,\\text{obs}} < i_{p}^{\\text{ideal}}.\n$$\nAdditionally, because $E_{\\text{int}} = E_{\\text{ctrl}} - i R_{u}$, the instantaneous interfacial overpotential is reduced at high $|i|$, broadening peaks and lowering their maxima.\n\nThese effects do not correspond to a uniform potential offset (which would require a constant, current-independent shift), but instead to a current-dependent distortion: increased peak separation and reduced peak currents with broadened peaks.\n\nThis eliminates the alternatives:\n- A drifting RE potential (option B) is excluded by the assumption of a stable RE; geometric shielding does not intrinsically cause RE potential drift.\n- Potentiostat compliance limiting and flat-topped clipping (option C) requires the available output voltage or current to be exceeded; mere obstruction of field lines does not necessarily force compliance and, instead, manifests as increased $R_{u}$ and distorted shapes rather than clipped plateaus.\n- A rigid horizontal shift of the entire CV (option D) would require a constant offset independent of current, contrary to the $i R_{u}$ dependence and the known increase in peak separation.\n- Pure mass-transport blocking with preserved reversible peak separation (option E) is not the primary outcome; the dominant artifact here is electrical (ohmic) rather than diffusional, and the increased $R_{u}$ necessarily inflates $\\Delta E_{p}$.\n\nTherefore, the primary artifact is a distorted voltammogram with a significant increase in peak separation and reduced peak currents.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1599509"}]}
