The electrochemical interface is probed using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The collected impedance data, when plotted on a Nyquist diagram ($-Z''$ vs. $Z'$), reveals a complex shape. The system's behavior is well-approximated by a Randles equivalent circuit. This circuit consists of the solution resistance, $R_s$, in series with a parallel combination of the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{ct}$, and the double-layer capacitance, $C_{dl}$. This entire network is, in turn, in series with a Warburg impedance element, $Z_W$, which accounts for the semi-infinite diffusion of oxygen to the metal surface.\n\nThe total complex impedance, $Z(\\omega)$, of this system is given by the expression:\n$$Z(\\omega) = R_s + \\frac{R_{ct}}{1 + j\\omega R_{ct}C_{dl}} + Z_W(\\omega)$$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $j = \\sqrt{-1}$.

The high-frequency intercept on the real axis is located at $Z'_{HF}$. This corresponds to the impedance as the frequency approaches infinity.\n2.  At intermediate frequencies, the plot forms a semicircle. If the diffusion process were absent (i.e., if $Z_W = 0$), this semicircle would intercept the real axis at a low-frequency value of $Z'_{LF}$. In the actual experiment, the plot deviates from the semicircle at low frequencies and transitions into a 45-degree line characteristic of diffusion, so $Z'_{LF}$ must be determined by fitting and extrapolating the measured semicircle to the real axis.\n\nBased on this model and these observations, derive a symbolic expression for the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{ct}$, in terms of the observable parameters $Z'_{HF}$ and $Z'_{LF}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for an expression for the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{ct}$, based on two characteristic values from the Nyquist plot of a Randles circuit with a Warburg element.

Since the impedance at this limit is purely real, we can equate the two:\n$$ Z'_{HF} = R_s $$\n\nNext, we analyze the low-frequency intercept of the semicircle portion, $Z'_{LF}$. The problem specifies that this is the value where the semicircle would intercept the real axis *if the Warburg impedance were absent*. This corresponds to the total impedance of the sub-circuit $Z_{sub}(\\omega) = R_s + \\frac{R_{ct}}{1 + j\\omega R_{ct}C_{dl}}$ in the low-frequency limit, as $\\omega \\to 0$.\nIn this sub-circuit, as $\\omega \\to 0$:\n- The term $j\\omega R_{ct}C_{dl}$ in the denominator approaches zero.\n- The impedance of the parallel RC component thus approaches $R_{ct}$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{R_{ct}}{1 + j\\omega R_{ct}C_{dl}} = \\frac{R_{ct}}{1 + 0} = R_{ct} $$\nThe total impedance of this hypothetical sub-circuit at low frequency is therefore:\n$$ Z_{sub}(\\omega \\to 0) = R_s + R_{ct} $$\nThis value corresponds to the extrapolated low-frequency intercept of the semicircle, $Z'_{LF}$.
