Understanding these potential interferences, from protein binding to electrode fouling, is crucial for developing robust and reliable analytical methods.", "problem": "An electrochemist is developing a method for detecting a novel pharmaceutical compound, 'DrugX', in blood plasma using Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV). The molecule is known to undergo a single-electron oxidation. Preliminary studies in a simple aqueous buffer show a well-defined, reversible oxidation peak at a potential of $+0.75$ V versus a standard reference electrode. When the electrochemist attempts to measure a plasma sample spiked with DrugX at a concentration of $20 \\ \\mu\\text{M}$, the voltogram, scanned from $+0.20$ V to $+1.20$ V, shows a flat baseline with no discernible peak.

You may select more than one option.\n\nA. DrugX binds strongly to a major plasma protein, such as albumin, making the drug molecule unavailable to reach the electrode surface for oxidation.\n\nB. The electron transfer kinetics for the oxidation of DrugX are significantly slower in the complex plasma matrix compared to the simple buffer, rendering the reaction electrochemically irreversible on the timescale of the SWV experiment.\n\nC. A component in the plasma adsorbs onto the electrode surface, forming a passive layer that blocks the electron transfer reaction of DrugX.\n\nD. The formal potential of DrugX is shifted to a potential more positive than $+1.20$ V due to interactions with the plasma matrix, moving the reaction outside the scanned potential window.\n\nE. The diffusion coefficient of DrugX in plasma is much lower than in the aqueous buffer, a change which is sufficient to completely eliminate the SWV peak.", "solution": "Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV) measures faradaic currents driven by potential modulation near the formal potential. For a diffusion-controlled, reversible, one-electron process, the SWV peak current scales as\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto n F A C_{\\text{free}} \\left(D f\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\, \\Phi(\\text{kinetics}),\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $A$ is the electroactive area, $C_{\\text{free}}$ is the concentration of electroactive species at the electrode, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $f$ is the square-wave frequency, and $\\Phi(\\text{kinetics})$ is a dimensionless factor that equals unity for reversible kinetics and decreases toward zero as kinetics become slow on the SWV timescale.

This is a plausible cause.\n\nB. The electron-transfer kinetics in plasma can become sluggish due to specific interactions, microviscosity, or coupled chemistry, so that the reaction becomes quasi-irreversible or effectively irreversible on the SWV timescale.

In SWV, a relevant dimensionless kinetic parameter is $\\Lambda = k^{0}/\\sqrt{D f}$; if $\\Lambda \\ll 1$, $\\Phi(\\text{kinetics}) \\to 0$, and the SWV peak collapses. Thus, slower kinetics in plasma can plausibly yield no observable peak.\n\nC. Adsorption of plasma components (proteins, lipids) can foul the electrode, forming a blocking layer.

Then\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto A_{\\text{eff}} = \\theta A.\n$$\nFor $\\theta \\to 0$ due to passivation, the faradaic response vanishes even if the analyte is present. This is a well-known and plausible cause in biological matrices.\n\nD. Interactions in plasma (binding, ion pairing, pH or speciation changes, coupled equilibria) can shift the apparent formal potential. For a ligand-coupled electron transfer, the apparent potential shifts by\n$$\nE_{\\text{app}}^{0'} = E^{0'} + \\frac{R T}{n F} \\ln \\Gamma,\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is a function of equilibrium constants and activities for the matrix-dependent speciation. If $E_{\\text{app}}^{0'}$ is shifted to a value greater than the upper limit of the scan, i.e., $E_{\\text{app}}^{0'} > 1.20 \\ \\text{V}$, then the oxidation peak would lie outside the window and no peak would be seen.

A lower diffusion coefficient reduces the peak magnitude via\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto D^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n$$\nA decrease in $D$ by any finite factor changes $i_{p}$ only by the square root of that factor. To eliminate the peak entirely by this mechanism alone would require $D \\to 0$, which is not physically realistic for a small molecule in plasma. Therefore, while a reduced $D$ diminishes signal, it is not, by itself, a sufficient explanation for the complete absence of the peak.\n\nTherefore, the plausible reasons are A, B, C, and D; E alone is not sufficient to completely eliminate the SWV peak.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "1589419"}]}
