The goal is to characterize a standard aqueous solution of a redox-active species, which is known to undergo a one-electron, reversible, diffusion-controlled reduction. The student uses a standard three-electrode setup with a planar working electrode of known geometric area $A$. Based on the known concentration of the analyte $C$, its diffusion coefficient $D$, the scan rate $v$, and the number of electrons transferred $n=1$, the student calculates the theoretical peak cathodic current, $i_{p,c}$, using the Randles-Sevcik equation.\n\nUpon running the experiment, the student obtains a voltammogram. However, the observed peak is very broad and ill-defined. Furthermore, the magnitude of the measured peak current is only about 40% of the theoretically predicted value. Assuming the student correctly prepared the solution and all instrumental parameters were set as intended, which of the following is the most plausible explanation for this significant discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the experimental observation?\n\nA. The scan rate, $v$, was accidentally set to a value much lower than what was used in the theoretical calculation.\n\nB. The working electrode was not properly polished and cleaned before the experiment, leaving its surface partially blocked by an insulating layer.\n\nC.

The potential of the reference electrode was unstable and drifted during the scan.", "solution": "For a reversible, diffusion-controlled, one-electron process at a planar electrode under linear sweep, the Randles–Sevcik relation gives the theoretical cathodic peak current as\n$$\ni_{p,c}^{\\text{theory}} = k\\, n F\\, A\\, C \\left(\\frac{n F}{R T}\\right)^{1/2} (D v)^{1/2},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the dimensionless coefficient for a reversible system, $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $A$ is the geometric electrode area, $C$ is the bulk analyte concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $v$ is the scan rate, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

Consider the possible causes in light of the scaling:\n- If the scan rate is lower than intended, the current scales as $i_{p,c} \\propto v^{1/2}$, so a mis-set $v$ could reduce magnitude. However, the assumption states instrumental parameters were set as intended, and, importantly, a simple reduction in $v$ within reversible diffusion control does not produce a very broad, ill-defined peak; the peak shape remains characteristic of reversible behavior. Therefore, this is not the most plausible explanation.\n- If the electrode surface is partially blocked by an insulating layer, the effective electroactive area is $A_{\\text{eff}} = \\beta A$ with $0<\\beta<1$. Then\n$$\ni_{p,c}^{\\text{meas}} = k\\, n F\\, A_{\\text{eff}}\\, C \\left(\\frac{n F}{R T}\\right)^{1/2} (D v)^{1/2} = \\beta\\, i_{p,c}^{\\text{theory}}.\n$$\nAn observed ratio of approximately $0.4$ corresponds to $\\beta \\approx 0.4$. Surface fouling also decreases the heterogeneous rate and introduces surface inhomogeneity, making the response appear quasi-reversible, which broadens and ill-defines the peak. This simultaneously explains both the reduced magnitude and the broadened peak.\n- If the supporting electrolyte concentration is very high, migration is further suppressed and solution resistance is reduced; within reasonable ranges this does not decrease the diffusion-controlled peak current by a large factor and typically improves peak definition. Thus it is not consistent with the observation.\n- If the analyte concentration is higher than labeled, $i_{p,c}$ would increase, not decrease, contradicting the observation.\n- If the reference electrode potential drifts, the potential axis is shifted, which can move or smear the peak position, but it does not systematically reduce the diffusion-controlled current magnitude to about $0.4$ of the predicted value. Large drift could distort the voltammogram, but this is a less direct and less plausible cause of the large, reproducible attenuation and broadening than surface fouling.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation consistent with both the reduced peak current and the broad, ill-defined peak is partial blocking of the working electrode surface due to inadequate polishing/cleaning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1578513"}]}
