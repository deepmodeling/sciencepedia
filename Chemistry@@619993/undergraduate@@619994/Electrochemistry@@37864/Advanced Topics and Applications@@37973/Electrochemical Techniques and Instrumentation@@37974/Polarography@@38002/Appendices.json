The equation is given by:\n$$i_d = k \\cdot n \\cdot D^{1/2} \\cdot m^{2/3} \\cdot t^{1/6} \\cdot C$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the half-reaction for the analyte, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte, $m$ is the mass flow rate of the mercury from the DME, $t$ is the drop lifetime, and $C$ is the concentration of the analyte.\n\nWe are given two different scenarios, one for thallium(I) and one for cadmium(II). Let's denote the parameters for the thallium(I) solution with subscript 1 and for the cadmium(II) solution with subscript 2.\n\nFor the first solution containing Tl⁺, the reduction reaction is $\\text{Tl}^{+} + e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Tl(Hg)}$. The number of electrons transferred per ion, $n_1$, is 1. The diffusion current, $i_{d,1}$, can be written as:\n$$i_{d,1} = k \\cdot n_1 \\cdot D_1^{1/2} \\cdot m_1^{2/3} \\cdot t_1^{1/6} \\cdot C_1$$\n\nFor the second solution containing Cd²⁺, the reduction reaction is $\\text{Cd}^{2+} + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{Cd(Hg)}$. The number of electrons transferred per ion, $n_2$, is 2. The diffusion current, $i_{d,2}$, can be written as:\n$$i_{d,2} = k \\cdot n_2 \\cdot D_2^{1/2} \\cdot m_2^{2/3} \\cdot t_2^{1/6} \\cdot C_2$$\n\nThe problem states several equivalences between the two experiments:\n1. The same DME is used, so the mass flow rate and drop time are identical: $m_1 = m_2 = m$ and $t_1 = t_2 = t$.\n2. The analytes have the same diffusion coefficient: $D_1 = D_2 = D$.\n3. The concentrations of the analytes are the same: $C_1 = C_2 = C$.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{i_{d,2}}{i_{d,1}}$. We can express this ratio using the Ilkovič equations for each case:\n$$\\frac{i_{d,2}}{i_{d,1}} = \\frac{k \\cdot n_2 \\cdot D_2^{1/2} \\cdot m_2^{2/3} \\cdot t_2^{1/6} \\cdot C_2}{k \\cdot n_1 \\cdot D_1^{1/2} \\cdot m_1^{2/3} \\cdot t_1^{1/6} \\cdot C_1}$$\n\nGiven the stated equalities, we can simplify this expression. The constant $k$, the diffusion coefficient term $D^{1/2}$, the mass flow rate term $m^{2/3}$, the drop time term $t^{1/6}$, and the concentration $C$ all cancel out from the numerator and the denominator.\n$$\\frac{i_{d,2}}{i_{d,1}} = \\frac{\\cancel{k} \\cdot n_2 \\cdot \\cancel{D^{1/2}} \\cdot \\cancel{m^{2/3}} \\cdot \\cancel{t^{1/6}} \\cdot \\cancel{C}}{\\cancel{k} \\cdot n_1 \\cdot \\cancel{D^{1/2}} \\cdot \\cancel{m^{2/3}} \\cdot \\cancel{t^{1/6}} \\cdot \\cancel{C}}$$\n\nThis simplifies the ratio to be solely dependent on the number of electrons transferred in each reaction:\n$$\\frac{i_{d,2}}{i_{d,1}} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$\n\nSubstituting the known values, $n_1 = 1$ and $n_2 = 2$:\n$$\\frac{i_{d,2}}{i_{d,1}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$$\n\nTherefore, the diffusion current for the cadmium(II) solution is twice the diffusion current for the thallium(I) solution under the specified conditions.
