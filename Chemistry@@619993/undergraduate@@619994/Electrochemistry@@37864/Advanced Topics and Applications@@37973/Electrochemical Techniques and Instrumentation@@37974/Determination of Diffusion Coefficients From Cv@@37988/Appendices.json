The reduced species R is not present initially. A Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment is performed on this solution using a planar working electrode with an area of $A = 0.0400$ cm$^2$.

Your task is to play the role of a data detective and identify the most likely experimental artifact responsible for this non-ideal behavior [@problem_id:1549097].", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is studying a newly synthesized organometallic compound using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) to determine the diffusion coefficient of its oxidized form in an acetonitrile solution. The compound undergoes a one-electron, reversible reduction. The researcher performs a series of CV experiments at different scan rates ($v$) and measures the corresponding cathodic peak current ($i_p$). To verify that the process is diffusion-controlled, they construct a plot of the absolute peak current, $|i_p|$, versus the square root of the scan rate, $v^{1/2}$. The data points form an excellent straight line, but when a linear regression is performed, the line has a significant, positive y-intercept instead of passing through the origin as predicted by the Randles-Sevcik equation.\n\nWhich of the following experimental artifacts is the most likely cause for this observation of a linear $|i_p|$ vs. $v^{1/2}$ plot with a positive y-intercept?\n\nA. The presence of a constant background current from a slow, steady-state electrochemical reaction involving an impurity in the solvent.\n\nB. High uncompensated solution resistance ($R_u$) between the working and reference electrodes.\n\nC. A significant contribution from the capacitive charging current of the electrical double layer at the electrode surface.\n\nD. Strong adsorption of the organometallic compound onto the surface of the working electrode.\n\nE. The reduction process is kinetically irreversible rather than chemically reversible.", "solution": "The analysis of this problem begins with the Randles-Sevcik equation, which describes the peak current ($i_p$) for a reversible, diffusion-controlled electrochemical process. The equation is given by:\n$$i_p = (2.69 \\times 10^5) n^{3/2} A D^{1/2} C v^{1/2}$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the redox event, $A$ is the electrode area, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the species, $C$ is the bulk concentration of the species, and $v$ is the scan rate.\n\nThis equation can be simplified to the form $i_p = k v^{1/2}$, where $k$ is a constant comprising all the other terms. This relationship shows that the peak current is directly proportional to the square root of the scan rate. Consequently, a plot of $|i_p|$ versus $v^{1/2}$ should yield a straight line that passes through the origin (0,0).\n\nThe problem states that the experimental plot is indeed a straight line but has a positive y-intercept. This means the measured current, let's call it $i_{meas}$, follows an empirical relationship of the form $i_{meas} = m \\cdot v^{1/2} + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the positive y-intercept. This suggests that the total measured current is the sum of the expected diffusion-controlled Faradaic current ($m \\cdot v^{1/2}$) and an additional, constant current component ($b$) that is independent of the scan rate $v$. We must now evaluate each option to see which one could produce such a constant, scan-rate-independent current.\n\nA. The presence of a constant background current from a slow, steady-state electrochemical reaction involving an impurity in the solvent.\nA slow, steady-state reaction would contribute a small, relatively constant current to the total measured current, irrespective of how quickly the potential is scanned. This constant current acts as an offset, $b$. The total current would then be $i_{meas} = i_p + i_{background} = k v^{1/2} + b$. This perfectly matches the observed linear relationship with a positive y-intercept. Thus, this is a very likely cause.\n\nB. High uncompensated solution resistance ($R_u$).\nUncompensated resistance causes an $iR$ drop, which distorts the shape of the voltammogram. It leads to a broadening of the peaks and a shift in the peak potentials. While it can affect the accuracy of the measured peak current, it does not introduce a scan-rate-independent offset current. The relationship $i_p \\propto v^{1/2}$ still fundamentally holds, and the plot should still extrapolate to the origin. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nC. A significant contribution from the capacitive charging current of the electrical double layer.\nThe current required to charge the electrical double layer at the electrode surface is known as capacitive current, $i_c$. This current is given by the relationship $i_c = C_{dl} v$, where $C_{dl}$ is the double-layer capacitance. The total measured current would be the sum of the Faradaic and capacitive currents: $i_{total} = i_p + i_c = k v^{1/2} + C_{dl} v$. A plot of $i_{total}$ versus $v^{1/2}$ would be $i_{total} = k (v^{1/2}) + C_{dl} (v^{1/2})^2$. This is the equation of a parabola, not a straight line. The plot would show an upward curvature. Since the problem explicitly states the plot is linear, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Strong adsorption of the organometallic compound onto the surface of the working electrode.\nFor species adsorbed to an electrode surface, the peak current is directly proportional to the scan rate, $v$, not $v^{1/2}$. If both diffusing and adsorbed species contribute to the current, the total peak current would be a sum of the two: $i_{total} = i_{diffusion} + i_{adsorbed} = k_1 v^{1/2} + k_2 v$. Similar to the capacitive current case, plotting this $i_{total}$ versus $v^{1/2}$ would result in a curve, not a straight line. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\nE. The reduction process is kinetically irreversible rather than chemically reversible.\nFor a totally irreversible process, the peak current is also proportional to the square root of the scan rate, described by the Delahay equation: $i_p = (2.99 \\times 10^5) n (\\alpha n_a)^{1/2} A D^{1/2} C v^{1/2}$, where $\\alpha$ is the transfer coefficient and $n_a$ is the number of electrons in the rate-determining step. Although the constant of proportionality is different from the reversible case, the dependence is still $i_p \\propto v^{1/2}$. A plot of $|i_p|$ versus $v^{1/2}$ would still be a straight line passing through the origin. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only phenomenon that results in a scan-rate-independent additive current, leading to a linear $|i_p|$ vs. $v^{1/2}$ plot with a positive y-intercept, is a constant background reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1549097"}]}
