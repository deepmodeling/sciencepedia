The molecule undergoes a one-electron transfer reaction ($n=1$). To characterize its electrochemical behavior, the researcher performs Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), a technique where the potential of a working electrode is ramped linearly versus time.\n\nAn initial experiment at a scan rate of $\\nu = 100$ mV/s reveals a well-defined pair of cathodic and anodic peaks. The measured potential separation between the anodic peak ($E_{pa}$) and the cathodic peak ($E_{pc}$), denoted as $\\Delta E_p = |E_{pa} - E_{pc}|$, is found to be 85 mV. This value is significantly larger than the theoretical value of approximately 59 mV expected for a simple, fast (Nernstian) one-electron transfer process.\n\nBased on this single observation, the researcher hypothesizes that the electrochemical system is **quasi-reversible**. In a quasi-reversible system, the rate of electron transfer at the electrode surface is finite and comparable to the rate of mass transport of the reactant to the electrode. To test this hypothesis, the researcher plans to conduct a series of CV experiments by systematically varying only the scan rate, $\\nu$.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would provide the strongest evidence to support the hypothesis that the system is quasi-reversible?\n\nA. The peak separation, $\\Delta E_p$, remains constant at 85 mV for all scan rates from 20 mV/s to 500 mV/s.\n\nB.

At low scan rates (e.g., 20 mV/s), both peaks are observed, but at high scan rates (e.g., 500 mV/s), the reverse (anodic) peak disappears completely.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the experimental observation, based on varying the scan rate in a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment, that would support the hypothesis of a quasi-reversible electrochemical system. To answer this, we must understand how the key observable in CV, the peak potential separation $\\Delta E_p$, behaves as a function of scan rate $\\nu$ for different types of systems: reversible, quasi-reversible, and irreversible.\n\nStep 1: Define the characteristics of different electrochemical systems in CV.\nThe behavior of an electrochemical system in CV is determined by the interplay between the rate of electron transfer (kinetics) and the rate of mass transport (diffusion). The scan rate, $\\nu$, controls the timescale of the experiment. A fast scan rate corresponds to a short experimental time, while a slow scan rate allows for a longer time.\n\n- **Reversible System**: Electron transfer is extremely fast (effectively instantaneous) compared to the rate of mass transport. The system is always at equilibrium at the electrode surface, governed by the Nernst equation. For a reversible one-electron process at room temperature (298 K), the theory predicts a peak separation $\\Delta E_p = |E_{pa} - E_{pc}|$ that is independent of the scan rate and has a constant value of approximately $57 - 59$ mV. The ratio of peak currents, $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$, is unity.\n\n- **Irreversible System**: Electron transfer is very slow. A large overpotential is required to drive the reaction, resulting in a very large $\\Delta E_p$. Often, the reverse peak is so broad and shifted that it is not observed at all within the potential window. The peak potentials, $E_p$, shift significantly with scan rate. For example, for an irreversible reduction, the cathodic peak potential $E_{pc}$ will shift to more negative values as the scan rate increases.\n\n- **Quasi-reversible System**: The rate of electron transfer is finite and comparable to the rate of mass transport. The behavior of the system is intermediate between reversible and irreversible and depends strongly on the scan rate.\n    - At very low scan rates, the experimental timescale is long, giving the electron transfer process enough time to keep up with the changing potential. The system behaves more like a reversible system, and $\\Delta E_p$ approaches the reversible value (e.g., ~59 mV for $n=1$).\n    - At very high scan rates, the experimental timescale is short. The potential sweeps past the equilibrium potential so quickly that the finite electron transfer kinetics cannot keep up. The system is \"outrun\" by the scan rate, behaving more like an irreversible system. This requires a larger overpotential to drive the reaction, which manifests as a larger peak separation $\\Delta E_p$.\n    - Therefore, for a quasi-reversible system, $\\Delta E_p$ is always greater than the reversible value and *increases* as the scan rate $\\nu$ increases.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given experimental hypothesis and initial data.\nThe initial observation is $\\Delta E_p = 85$ mV for a one-electron process. This is larger than the ~59 mV expected for a reversible system, which correctly rules out ideal reversibility and suggests either quasi-reversible or irreversible kinetics. The hypothesis is that the system is quasi-reversible.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option based on the theory.\n\n- **Option A**: \"The peak separation, $\\Delta E_p$, remains constant at 85 mV for all scan rates.\" If $\\Delta E_p$ is constant and independent of the scan rate, the system is, by definition, kinetically reversible. The fact that the value (85 mV) is larger than the theoretical value (59 mV) might be due to experimental artifacts like uncompensated solution resistance ($iR_{u}$ drop), not the intrinsic electron transfer kinetics. This observation would contradict the quasi-reversible hypothesis, which requires $\\Delta E_p$ to be dependent on $\\nu$.\n\n- **Option B**: \"The peak separation, $\\Delta E_p$, increases as the scan rate, $\\nu$, is increased.\" This is the hallmark signature of a quasi-reversible system. As $\\nu$ increases, the kinetic limitations of the electron transfer become more prominent, requiring larger overpotentials for both the forward and reverse scans, thus leading to a larger separation between the peaks. This observation directly supports the hypothesis.\n\n- **Option C**: \"The peak separation, $\\Delta E_p$, decreases as the scan rate, $\\nu$, is increased.\" This behavior is the opposite of what is expected for a quasi-reversible system. A decreasing $\\Delta E_p$ with increasing $\\nu$ is not a characteristic of any standard simple electron transfer model and would disprove the hypothesis.\n\n- **Option D**: \"The ratio of the anodic peak current to the cathodic peak current, $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$, is measured to be approximately 1.0 at all scan rates, and the peak separation $\\Delta E_p$ is constant.\" This describes an ideal or near-ideal reversible system. It contradicts both the initial measurement ($\\Delta E_p = 85$ mV > 59 mV) and the quasi-reversible hypothesis.\n\n- **Option E**: \"At low scan rates, both peaks are observed, but at high scan rates, the reverse (anodic) peak disappears completely.\" The disappearance of a reverse peak is typically characteristic of a fast chemical reaction that consumes the product of the initial electron transfer (an EC mechanism). While the system might also be quasi-reversible, this observation more strongly points towards chemical irreversibility rather than kinetic quasi-reversibility. It does not provide the most direct or unambiguous evidence for the quasi-reversible nature of the *electron transfer step* itself.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and strongest evidence for a quasi-reversible system among the choices is the systematic increase of the peak separation, $\\Delta E_p$, with an increasing scan rate, $\\nu$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1582777"}, {"introduction": "After identifying the qualitative signatures of different kinetic regimes, the next step is quantitative analysis.
