The data is visualized in a Nyquist plot, which shows the negative of the imaginary part of the impedance ($-Z''$) against the real part ($Z'$).\n\nIn an initial experiment conducted in a quiescent (unstirred) solution, the Nyquist plot clearly shows a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line with a slope close to 1 in the low-frequency region.

The associated limiting current density is\n$$\ni_{L} = n F k_{m} C^{*},\n$$\nwhich becomes large as $\\delta$ decreases. In impedance terms, the diffusion element becomes a finite-length diffusion impedance whose low-frequency limit is a finite real resistance rather than a $45^{\\circ}$ line; as $k_{m}$ increases, the magnitude of the mass-transport impedance decreases and can become negligible over the measured frequency range. Consequently, the Nyquist plot loses the Warburg tail and retains only the high-frequency semicircle.\n\nTherefore, with vigorous stirring, mass transport is no longer the rate-limiting step; the dominant (and thus rate-limiting) process is interfacial electron transfer, characterized by $R_{ct} = \\frac{R T}{n F i_{0}}$ (with $i_{0}$ the exchange current density). The persistence of the semicircle and the disappearance of the Warburg feature uniquely indicate kinetic (charge-transfer) control rather than diffusion limitation. Ohmic resistance $R_{s}$ only shifts the plot along the real axis and cannot account for the observed change in low-frequency behavior; thermodynamic favorability is not a kinetic limitation; and a coupled homogeneous reaction would produce a different impedance signature (e.g., Gerischer), which is not observed.\n\nHence, under vigorous stirring, the rate-limiting step is the electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1601010"}, {"introduction": "A powerful application of impedance spectroscopy is the ability to extract meaningful physical parameters from experimental data.
