The reduction of water to produce hydrogen gas.\n\nE. The oxidation of the chloride ions from a potential KCl supporting electrolyte.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to identify the most probable interfering electrochemical reaction that occurs when an aqueous solution is not deaerated before a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment, particularly when scanning to negative potentials.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental oversight.**\nThe key piece of information is that the student did not purge the aqueous solution with an inert gas. The primary purpose of this purging step in electrochemistry is to remove dissolved atmospheric oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$). Standard air is approximately 21% oxygen, which is soluble in water. Therefore, the solution contains a significant concentration of electroactive $\\text{O}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the nature of the expected interference.**\nThe question asks for a cathodic (reduction) peak observed while scanning in the negative potential direction (from $+0.5 \\text{ V}$ to $-1.0 \\text{ V}$). We must therefore look for a reduction reaction involving a species present in the unpurged solution that occurs within this potential window.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each option.**\n\n*   **A. The oxidation of water to produce oxygen gas.**\n    The electrochemical oxidation of water is given by the half-reaction:\n    $$2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightarrow \\text{O}_2(g) + 4\\text{H}^+(aq) + 4e^-$$\n    This is an *oxidation* reaction, which would produce an anodic current, not a cathodic (reduction) current. Furthermore, this process occurs at highly *positive* potentials, generally greater than $+1.23 \\text{ V}$ vs. the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), and is thus outside the scanned potential window. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. The reduction of the nitrogen component of dissolved air.**\n    Atmospheric air is about 78% nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$). However, the triple bond in the $\\text{N}_2$ molecule is exceptionally strong, making it extremely stable and electrochemically inert under these conditions. The reduction of dinitrogen is a very difficult process that requires specialized catalysts and extreme conditions, not achievable in a standard CV experiment. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. The reduction of dissolved atmospheric oxygen.**\n    Dissolved oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) is a well-known electroactive species. In neutral or alkaline aqueous solutions, its reduction is a prominent process that typically occurs in two steps. The first reduction step, which is usually the most visible in CV, is the two-electron reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide:\n    $$\\text{O}_2(aq) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2(aq) + 2\\text{OH}^-(aq)$$\n    On a glassy carbon electrode in neutral solution, the peak for this reduction typically appears in the range of $-0.2 \\text{ V}$ to $-0.6 \\text{ V}$ vs. a standard reference electrode like Ag/AgCl. This potential is well within the experimental window of $+0.5 \\text{ V}$ to $-1.0 \\text{ V}$. This is a cathodic (reduction) process and is the primary reason why deaeration is a standard and critical procedure in most electrochemical experiments. This is a very strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\n*   **D. The reduction of water to produce hydrogen gas.**\n    The reduction of water, also known as the hydrogen evolution reaction, is:\n    $$2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2(g) + 2\\text{OH}^-(aq)$$\n    The standard potential for this reaction at pH 7 is $-0.828 \\text{ V}$ vs. SHE. While this potential is within the scan range, the reaction often exhibits a large overpotential on many electrode surfaces, including glassy carbon. This means that a significantly more negative potential than the thermodynamic value is required to drive the reaction at an appreciable rate. Therefore, while hydrogen evolution might begin at the very end of the scan (near $-1.0 \\text{ V}$), the oxygen reduction peak (option C) occurs at a much less negative potential and would be observed first and more prominently as the major interfering peak. For this reason, option C is a better description of the *most likely* and *significant* interference.\n\n*   **E. The oxidation of the chloride ions from a potential KCl supporting electrolyte.**\n    If KCl were the electrolyte, the oxidation of chloride ions would be:\n    $$2\\text{Cl}^-(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^-$$\n    This is an *oxidation* reaction (anodic current), not a reduction. Also, it occurs at very positive potentials (standard potential is $+1.36 \\text{ V}$ vs. SHE), which is outside the experimental scan window. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nComparing the options, the reduction of dissolved atmospheric oxygen (C) is the only process that is a) a reduction (cathodic), b) involves a species present due to the lack of purging, and c) occurs reliably and significantly within the specified potential window on a standard electrode. It is the classic interfering reaction that necessitates deaeration in reductive electrochemistry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1548149"}, {"introduction": "While ideal cyclic voltammograms provide clear data, real-world measurements are often distorted by experimental artifacts. This exercise tackles the important issue of uncompensated solution resistance, known as the $iR$ drop, which can significantly alter the measured peak potentials. By calculating the impact of this resistance on peak separation ($\\Delta E_p$), you will learn to diagnose and quantify a common non-ideal effect, a crucial step toward accurate experimental analysis [@problem_id:1548104].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is performing a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment to characterize a new organometallic compound in an acetonitrile solution. The compound is known to undergo a chemically and electrochemically reversible one-electron oxidation. In an ideal experiment at the working temperature of 298.15 K, the theoretical separation between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials ($\\Delta E_p = E_{pa} - E_{pc}$) for this process is 59.2 mV.\n\nDue to an incorrect experimental setup, the Luggin capillary of the reference electrode was placed far from the surface of the working electrode. This introduces a significant uncompensated solution resistance, $R_u$, between the reference and working electrodes, which is measured to be 225 $\\Omega$.

Express your answer in millivolts (mV) and round it to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the observed peak separation in a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiment where there is a significant uncompensated solution resistance, $R_u$.\n\nThe key principle is to understand how uncompensated resistance affects the potential measured and controlled by the potentiostat. The potential applied by the potentiostat, $E_{applied}$, is not the same as the potential experienced at the electrode-solution interface, $E_{interface}$, where the redox reaction occurs. The difference is the potential drop across the solution resistance, often called the iR drop, governed by Ohm's Law.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$E_{applied} = E_{interface} + iR_u$$\nwhere $i$ is the current flowing through the cell and $R_u$ is the uncompensated resistance.\n\nThe voltammogram plots the current $i$ versus the applied potential $E_{applied}$. Therefore, the peak potentials we observe, $E_{pa,obs}$ (anodic) and $E_{pc,obs}$ (cathodic), are values of $E_{applied}$. The ideal peak potentials, $E_{pa,ideal}$ and $E_{pc,ideal}$, correspond to the potential at the interface.\n\nAt the anodic peak, the current is the anodic peak current, $i_{pa}$, and the observed potential is $E_{pa,obs}$. So, we have:\n$$E_{pa,obs} = E_{pa,ideal} + i_{pa}R_u$$\n\nSimilarly, at the cathodic peak, the current is the cathodic peak current, $i_{pc}$, and the observed potential is $E_{pc,obs}$:\n$$E_{pc,obs} = E_{pc,ideal} + i_{pc}R_u$$\n\nThe observed peak separation, $\\Delta E_{p,obs}$, is the difference between the observed anodic and cathodic peak potentials:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = E_{pa,obs} - E_{pc,obs}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the observed potentials:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = (E_{pa,ideal} + i_{pa}R_u) - (E_{pc,ideal} + i_{pc}R_u)$$\n\nRearranging the terms, we can separate the ideal component from the resistance-induced component:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = (E_{pa,ideal} - E_{pc,ideal}) + (i_{pa} - i_{pc})R_u$$\n\nThe first term, $(E_{pa,ideal} - E_{pc,ideal})$, is the ideal peak separation for a reversible system, which is given in the problem as $\\Delta E_{p,ideal} = 59.2$ mV.\n\nThe second term involves the peak currents. By convention, anodic current (oxidation) is positive, and cathodic current (reduction) is negative. The problem states that the magnitude of the peak current is $i_p = 75.0$ $\\mu$A. Therefore:\n$i_{pa} = i_p = 75.0$ $\\mu$A\n$i_{pc} = -i_p = -75.0$ $\\mu$A\n\nSubstituting these into the second term:\n$$(i_{pa} - i_{pc})R_u = (i_p - (-i_p))R_u = 2i_p R_u$$\n\nNow we can calculate the numerical value of this additional potential separation caused by the resistance. First, we must use consistent SI units.\n$i_p = 75.0$ $\\mu$A = $75.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ A\n$R_u = 225$ $\\Omega$\n\nThe additional separation is:\n$$2i_p R_u = 2 \\times (75.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ A}) \\times (225 \\text{ }\\Omega) = 0.03375 \\text{ V}$$\n\nTo add this to the ideal separation, we should convert it to millivolts (mV):\n$$0.03375 \\text{ V} = 33.75 \\text{ mV}$$\n\nNow, we can find the total observed peak separation:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = \\Delta E_{p,ideal} + 2i_p R_u$$\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = 59.2 \\text{ mV} + 33.75 \\text{ mV} = 92.95 \\text{ mV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculation of the resistive term $2i_p R_u$ involves values with three significant figures ($75.0$ $\\mu$A and $225$ $\\Omega$). The result $33.75$ mV should be rounded to three significant figures, which gives $33.8$ mV.\nThen, we perform the addition:\n$$\\Delta E_{p,obs} = 59.2 \\text{ mV} + 33.8 \\text{ mV} = 93.0 \\text{ mV}$$\nThe addition rule requires rounding to the last common decimal place, which is the tenths place, so the result is 93.0 mV.
