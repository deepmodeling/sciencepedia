It is known that the oxidized species O and the reduced species R are both stable and soluble in the electrolyte solution. The experiment involves recording a series of voltammograms at different potential scan rates, denoted by $\\nu$. At very low scan rates, the system exhibits electrochemically reversible behavior, meaning the rate of electron transfer is much faster than the rate of mass transport. However, as the scan rate is progressively increased, the system's kinetics can no longer keep pace with the rate of potential change, and the behavior transitions into the quasi-reversible regime, where electron transfer and mass transport rates are comparable. The Nicholson method is a procedure that relates kinetic parameters, like the standard heterogeneous rate constant ($k^0$), to the experimental data obtained in this quasi-reversible region.\n\nWhich of the following experimental observations is the most direct and defining indicator that the system has transitioned from the reversible to the quasi-reversible regime, which is the key phenomenon leveraged by the Nicholson method analysis?\n\nA. The peak current, $i_p$, ceases to be proportional to the square root of the scan rate, $\\nu^{1/2}$.\n\nB.

At very low scan rates $\\nu$, the electron transfer is fast compared to mass transport, so the electrode surface maintains Nernstian equilibrium:\n$$\nE = E^{0'} + \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{c_{O}(0,t)}{c_{R}(0,t)}\\right),\n$$\nwith $n=1$ here. Under these reversible conditions, two hallmark results follow.\n\nFirst, the Randles–Sevcik relation gives for a diffusion-controlled reversible process\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto \\nu^{1/2},\n$$\nwith the proportionality depending on $n$, $F$, $A$, bulk concentration, diffusion coefficients, and $T$, but crucially the square-root dependence on $\\nu$ holds.\n\nSecond, the peak separation is a constant determined only by $T$ and $n$, independent of $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{p}^{\\mathrm{rev}} = |E_{pa} - E_{pc}| = \\kappa \\frac{RT}{nF},\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a known numerical constant for planar diffusion in reversible CV. Thus, at low $\\nu$, $\\Delta E_{p}$ is independent of $\\nu$.\n\nAs $\\nu$ increases, the system can enter the quasi-reversible regime, where finite electron-transfer kinetics are comparable to mass transport. The interfacial concentrations no longer follow the Nernst relation instantaneously, causing kinetic polarization that shifts the peak potentials away from their reversible values.

Nicholson tabulated a monotonic functional relation $\\Delta E_{p} = f(\\psi)$: as $\\psi$ decreases, $\\Delta E_{p}$ increases above its reversible constant. Therefore, the defining and most direct observable of the transition into the quasi-reversible regime, and the key quantity exploited by the Nicholson analysis, is that $\\Delta E_{p}$ begins to increase from its constant reversible value and becomes a function of $\\nu$.\n\nBy contrast:\n- The proportionality $i_{p} \\propto \\nu^{1/2}$ (option A) can approximately persist even as kinetics slow; its breakdown is not the primary Nicholson diagnostic and can be influenced by other nonidealities.\n- The peak current ratio $|i_{pa}/i_{pc}|$ (option C) can deviate from unity even for reversible systems if $D_{O} \\neq D_{R}$; hence it is not a defining indicator of quasi-reversibility.\n- The midpoint potential shift (option D) can be affected by unequal diffusion coefficients and ohmic or capacitive effects, and is not the primary parameter used in Nicholson’s method.\n- Charge imbalance between forward and reverse scans (option E) indicates additional processes (e.g., follow-up chemistry or adsorption) and is not required for quasi-reversible electron-transfer kinetics.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and defining indicator used by the Nicholson method is the increase of $\\Delta E_{p}$ with $\\nu$ from its reversible constant value.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1573807"}, {"introduction": "Once a quasi-reversible system has been identified, the next step is to quantify its kinetics.
