This means that one or more of the parameters in the numerator ($n, F, A, D, C^*$) must be effectively smaller in the experiment than the values used in the theoretical calculation. Let's examine each option:\n\n**A. A significant portion of the electrode surface is electrochemically inactive or \"blocked\".**\nThe parameter $A$ in the Cottrell equation represents the electroactive area of the electrode. If a portion of the surface is blocked or passivated (e.g., by impurities or an oxide layer), the effective area $A_{eff}$ where the reaction can occur is smaller than the geometric area $A_{geom}$ used in the theoretical calculation. Since the slope $m$ is directly proportional to the area ($m \\propto A$), a smaller effective area ($A_{eff} < A_{geom}$) will result in a smaller experimental slope. This change does not affect the time dependence, so the plot of $i$ versus $t^{-1/2}$ would remain linear. This is a very strong and direct explanation for the observation.\n\n**B. The diffusion coefficient of the reactant species $\\text{O}$ is actually larger than the literature value used in the calculation.**\nThe slope $m$ is proportional to the square root of the diffusion coefficient ($m \\propto \\sqrt{D}$). If the actual diffusion coefficient $D$ were *larger* than the value used for the theoretical calculation, the experimental slope would be *larger* than predicted, not smaller. This contradicts the observation.\n\n**C. The experiment was performed without stirring, allowing a concentration gradient to develop.**\nThe derivation of the Cottrell equation explicitly assumes that mass transport occurs only by diffusion in a semi-infinite, unstirred (quiescent) solution. The formation of a concentration gradient (or depletion layer) is the fundamental physical process that the equation describes. Therefore, this is a necessary condition for observing Cottrell behavior, not a reason for deviation from it.\n\n**D. Natural convection begins to enhance mass transport after the first few seconds of the experiment.**\nThe Cottrell model assumes mass transport is purely by diffusion. Convection (either natural or forced) is an additional mechanism of mass transport that brings fresh reactant to the electrode surface. This would *increase* the current compared to the purely diffusional case, especially at longer times when the diffusion-driven flux has decreased. An increased current would lead to a slope that is *larger* than the theoretical prediction, or would cause an upward deviation from linearity in the plot. This contradicts the observation.\n\n**E. The product species $\\text{R}$ strongly adsorbs to the electrode surface as it is formed.**\nIf the product $\\text{R}$ adsorbs onto the electrode, it would progressively block the active sites as the reaction proceeds. This would cause the effective area $A_{eff}$ to decrease with time. A time-dependent area would mean the current decays *faster* than $t^{-1/2}$. Consequently, the plot of $i$ versus $t^{-1/2}$ would not be linear; it would show a downward curvature. The problem states the plot *is* linear, making this explanation inconsistent with the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible explanation that is consistent with all aspects of the experimental observation (linearity maintained, but slope is smaller) is that the electroactive area is smaller than the geometric area assumed in the calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1592849"}]}
