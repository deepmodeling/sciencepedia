The bulk electrolyte solution between the working and counter electrodes has been completely consumed, creating an open circuit.", "solution": "The problem describes a galvanostatic experiment where the instrument is tasked with maintaining a constant current flow between the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE). The instrument achieves this by adjusting the potential difference between the WE and CE. The potential of the WE itself is monitored relative to a stable reference electrode (RE). The observation is that the measured potential, $E_{\\text{WE-RE}}$, suddenly plummets to the instrument's most negative possible output value (the compliance voltage).\n\nLet's analyze the core principle. A galvanostat is a current source. According to a conceptual form of Ohm's Law, $V = IR$, to maintain a constant current $I$ when the effective resistance $R$ of the system increases, the voltage $V$ must also increase. In an electrochemical cell, \"resistance\" to the flow of current can come from many sources, including solution resistance, charge transfer kinetics, and limitations in the transport of reactants to the electrode surface. The cathodic current is carried by the reduction of Cu²⁺ ions at the WE. The rate of this reaction is proportional to the current.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The surface of the copper counter electrode has become passivated by an insulating oxide layer, halting the anodic counter-reaction.**\nThe counter electrode's role is to complete the electrical circuit by performing the opposite reaction (in this case, oxidation, likely of copper to Cu²⁺ or water to O₂). If the CE passivates, its resistance to charge transfer would skyrocket. The galvanostat, which controls the current in the WE-CE loop, would indeed have to apply a much larger total voltage between the WE and CE to force the set current through. This would cause the potential of *both* the WE and the CE to shift. While this would affect the measured $E_{\\text{WE-RE}}$, the primary failure is at the CE, not the WE. Depletion at the WE (Option B) is a more direct cause for the potential of the WE itself to rail.\n\n**B. The concentration of Cu²⁺ ions in the electrolyte immediately adjacent to the working electrode surface has been depleted, approaching zero.**\nThis is the most likely explanation. The galvanostat forces a constant rate of reaction (constant current). This reaction consumes Cu²⁺ ions at the WE surface. These ions are replenished from the bulk solution by diffusion and convection. If the rate of consumption (set by the current) is faster than the rate of replenishment, the concentration of Cu²⁺ at the electrode surface, $C_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}}^{\\text{surface}}$, will decrease. At a certain point, $C_{\\text{Cu}^{2+}}^{\\text{surface}}$ will drop to nearly zero. This condition is known as mass transport limitation. The maximum current that can be supported by the diffusion of reactants to the surface is called the limiting current, $I_L$. If the galvanostat's set current, $I_{\\text{set}}$, is greater than $I_L$ ($I_{\\text{set}} > I_L$), the cell can no longer supply the required current via Cu²⁺ reduction. To maintain the constant current $I_{\\text{set}}$, the instrument must find another cathodic reaction to carry the current. It does so by drastically increasing the cathodic overpotential (making $E_{\\text{WE-RE}}$ far more negative) until another species, typically the solvent (water), begins to reduce: $2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2(\\text{g}) + 2\\text{OH}^-$. The potential required for water reduction is much more negative than that for copper deposition. Therefore, the potential rapidly drops and hits the instrument's negative compliance voltage limit. This perfectly explains the observation.\n\n**C. The deposited copper layer on the working electrode has become highly porous, significantly increasing its electrochemically active surface area.**\nIf the surface area of the WE increases, the current density ($j = I/A$) for a constant total current $I$ would decrease. According to electrochemical kinetics (e.g., the Butler-Volmer equation), a lower current density requires a *smaller* overpotential. This means the potential $E_{\\text{WE-RE}}$ would become *less* negative (closer to the equilibrium potential), which is the opposite of what was observed.\n\n**D. The Luggin capillary of the reference electrode has become clogged with a crystalline precipitate, electrically isolating the reference electrode.**\nThe RE circuit is a high-impedance measurement circuit; it does not carry the main cell current. If the RE becomes isolated, its potential measurement becomes unstable and \"floats.\" While a floating input to a voltmeter can sometimes rail to one of its limits, there is no physical reason it would specifically rail to the *negative* limit. The direction of the potential shift gives a strong clue. The specific drop to the negative rail is characteristic of the galvanostat trying to force a cathodic process that has failed, as described in option B.\n\n**E. The bulk electrolyte solution between the working and counter electrodes has been completely consumed, creating an open circuit.**\nThis is an extreme and unlikely scenario. Unless the volume of electrolyte was minuscule, it would not be \"completely consumed\". Even if it were, this would create an open circuit between the WE and CE. The instrument's response would be to drive the voltage between WE and CE to its limit, but this is a catastrophic cell failure rather than a specific chemical process like depletion. Reactant depletion at the electrode surface (Option B) is a standard, expected phenomenon in unstirred or high-current-density experiments and is a much more common and probable cause.\n\nTherefore, the depletion of the electroactive species (Cu²⁺) at the working electrode surface is the most direct and accurate explanation for the observed behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1581033"}]}
