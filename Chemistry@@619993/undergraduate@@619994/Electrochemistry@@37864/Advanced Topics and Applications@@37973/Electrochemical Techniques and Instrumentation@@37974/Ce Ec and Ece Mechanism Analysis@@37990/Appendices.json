Voltammetric studies reveal that only the enol form (E) is electrochemically active, undergoing rapid reduction at a planar electrode surface when a sufficiently negative potential is applied. The ketone form (K) is electro-inactive.\n\nUnder conditions where the potential is held at a value that causes the instantaneous reduction of any enol molecules arriving at the electrode, the system reaches a steady state. In this steady state, a thin \"reaction layer\" of thickness $\\mu$ forms adjacent to the electrode. Within this layer, the concentration of the enol is depleted because of the electrode reaction, and this deficit is replenished by the chemical conversion of the ketone to the enol.\n\nThe thickness of this reaction layer, $\\mu$, can be defined as the characteristic distance an enol molecule can diffuse from its point of creation before it is likely to be converted back into the inactive ketone form by the reverse reaction. This balance between diffusion and chemical reaction kinetics determines the size of the region from which the electrode can draw current.\n\nAssuming the reverse reaction (E $\\to$ K) is a first-order process, derive a symbolic expression for the steady-state reaction layer thickness, $\\mu$.
