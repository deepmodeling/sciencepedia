This directly explains a linear Anson plot with a negative y-intercept.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n\nA. Incomplete overpotential (mixed kinetic-diffusion control) violates the Cottrell $t^{-1/2}$ dependence, typically causing curvature in the Anson plot rather than a perfect straight line; it does not selectively create a negative constant offset while preserving linearity.\n\nB. Uncompensated solution resistance produces a time-dependent $iR$ drop that perturbs the effective potential at the electrode, again causing deviations from pure $t^{-1/2}$ behavior and curvature, not a purely linear plot with a shifted intercept.\n\nC. A constant oxidation current from an impurity adds an approximately time-independent current $I_{\\text{imp}}$, contributing a term $I_{\\text{imp}} t$ to the charge. In $Q$ versus $t^{1/2}$ coordinates, this yields curvature (since $t$ is not proportional to $t^{1/2}$), not a straight line with a negative intercept.\n\nD. Over-subtraction of background charge due to a blank with higher double-layer capacitance subtracts too large a constant $Q_{\\text{dl}}$, shifting the intercept negative while maintaining the correct Cottrell slope and linearity at late times. This matches the observation.\n\nE. Natural convection drives the current toward a steady value at longer times, adding an $I_{\\text{ss}} t$ contribution to $Q$, which produces curvature in the Anson plot rather than a straight line.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation for a linear Anson plot with a negative y-intercept is an erroneous background subtraction using a blank with higher double-layer capacitance than the main experiment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1538985"}]}
