The key information provided is that the electrochemical process is diffusion-controlled and reversible.\n\nFor a reversible, diffusion-controlled process, the peak current, $i_p$, is described by the Randles-Sevcik equation:\n$$ i_p = (2.69 \\times 10^5) n^{3/2} A D^{1/2} C_0 \\nu^{1/2} $$\nwhere:\n- $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the redox event.\n- $A$ is the electrode surface area.\n- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte.\n- $C_0$ is the bulk concentration of the analyte.\n- $\\nu$ is the potential scan rate.\n\nIn this problem, we are comparing two experiments where only the scan rate $\\nu$ is changed. All other parameters—n, A, D, and C—are constant. Therefore, we can group all the constant terms into a single constant, $k$:\n$$ k = (2.69 \\times 10^5) n^{3/2} A D^{1/2} C_0 $$\nThe Randles-Sevcik equation then simplifies to a direct proportionality between the peak current and the square root of the scan rate:\n$$ i_p = k \\sqrt{\\nu} $$\nWe can use this relationship to compare the two experimental conditions. Let $i_{p,1}$ and $\\nu_1$ be the peak current and scan rate for the first experiment, and $i_{p,2}$ and $\\nu_2$ be the values for the second experiment. We can write:\n$$ i_{p,1} = k \\sqrt{\\nu_1} $$\n$$ i_{p,2} = k \\sqrt{\\nu_2} $$\nTo find the unknown peak current $i_{p,2}$, we can take the ratio of these two equations, which eliminates the constant $k$:\n$$ \\frac{i_{p,2}}{i_{p,1}} = \\frac{k \\sqrt{\\nu_2}}{k \\sqrt{\\nu_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu_2}{\\nu_1}} $$\nNow, we can solve for $i_{p,2}$:\n$$ i_{p,2} = i_{p,1} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu_2}{\\nu_1}} $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $i_{p,1} = 2.57\\,\\mu\\text{A}$\n- $\\nu_1 = 100.0 \\text{ mV/s}$\n- $\\nu_2 = 350.0 \\text{ mV/s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ i_{p,2} = (2.57\\,\\mu\\text{A}) \\sqrt{\\frac{350.0 \\text{ mV/s}}{100.0 \\text{ mV/s}}} $$\nThe units of scan rate (mV/s) cancel out inside the square root:\n$$ i_{p,2} = (2.57\\,\\mu\\text{A}) \\sqrt{3.500} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ i_{p,2} \\approx (2.57\\,\\mu\\text{A}) \\times 1.87082869 $$\n$$ i_{p,2} \\approx 4.8079357\\,\\mu\\text{A} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ i_{p,2} \\approx 4.81\\,\\mu\\text{A} $$\nThe final answer is therefore 4.81.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.81}$$", "id": "1569587"}, {"introduction": "The classic peak-shaped voltammogram is characteristic of a quiescent (unstirred) solution where mass transport is governed purely by diffusion. This practice challenges you to consider what happens to the voltammetric response if the solution is vigorously stirred, introducing forced convection. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1569605] is critical for understanding the distinction between diffusion-controlled transient responses and convection-driven steady-state responses, a core concept that differentiates various families of electrochemical techniques.", "problem": "An electrochemical experiment is designed to study the oxidation of a soluble species $R$, which undergoes a reversible one-electron transfer to form product $O$: $R \\rightleftharpoons O + e^{-}$. The experiment is conducted in an electrochemical cell containing a working electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode. The solution initially contains species $R$ at a bulk concentration of $C_R^*$ and a high concentration of an inert supporting electrolyte to minimize ion migration effects.\n\nIn a first experiment, a Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) measurement is performed on the solution while it is kept perfectly still (quiescent). The potential of the working electrode is scanned linearly with time from a region where no reaction occurs to a potential sufficiently positive to cause the oxidation of $R$. The resulting voltammogram (a plot of current vs. potential) exhibits the characteristic shape for a diffusion-controlled process: the current rises to a peak value, $i_p$, and then decays.\n\nA second experiment is then performed under identical conditions (same cell, solution, and potential scan rate), but with one critical modification: the solution is vigorously and constantly stirred throughout the entire potential scan, inducing a steady rate of forced convection.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the shape of the voltammogram that will be observed in this second, stirred-solution experiment?\n\nA. The voltammogram will retain its peak shape, but the peak current will be significantly larger than the original peak current $i_p$.\n\nB. The voltammogram will not exhibit a current peak. Instead, the current will rise as the potential becomes more positive and then level off, reaching a steady-state limiting current plateau. The overall curve will have a sigmoidal shape.\n\nC. The voltammogram will show a peak at the same potential as the unstirred experiment, but the current will decay much more rapidly after the peak due to the disruptive effect of stirring.\n\nD. The current will be approximately zero throughout the potential scan because the stirring prevents the formation of a stable concentration gradient of the reactant $R$ at the electrode surface.\n\nE. The voltammogram will be identical to the one from the quiescent solution experiment, as the rate of electron transfer, not mass transport, is the sole determinant of the current.", "solution": "The key to understanding the difference between the two experiments lies in analyzing the dominant mode of mass transport of the reactant species $R$ to the surface of the working electrode. In electrochemistry, there are three modes of mass transport: diffusion (movement due to a concentration gradient), migration (movement of charged species in an electric field), and convection (movement due to mechanical forces like stirring or solution flow).\n\nIn the first experiment (quiescent solution), the presence of a high concentration of supporting electrolyte effectively eliminates the electric field gradient in the bulk solution, so migration of the reactant $R$ (if charged) is negligible. Since the solution is unstirred, there is no forced convection. Therefore, mass transport is governed exclusively by diffusion. As the potential is swept to values where the oxidation of $R$ occurs, the concentration of $R$ at the electrode surface, $C_R(x=0)$, begins to decrease. This creates a concentration gradient between the surface and the bulk solution, driving the diffusion of $R$ towards the electrode. The region over which this concentration gradient exists is called the diffusion layer. The current, which is proportional to the flux of $R$ at the surface, initially increases as the applied potential becomes more positive, driving the reaction faster. However, as the reaction proceeds, the diffusion layer grows thicker, meaning $R$ has to travel a longer distance to reach the electrode. This expanding depletion region causes the flux to decrease, resulting in the characteristic current peak followed by a decay. This is described by the Randles-Sevcik equation for the peak current, $i_p$.\n\nIn the second experiment, the solution is vigorously and constantly stirred. This introduces forced convection as the dominant mode of mass transport in the bulk solution. The stirring is much more efficient at transporting the reactant $R$ towards the electrode than diffusion is. The stirring action continuously replenishes the solution near the electrode, preventing the formation of a large-scale depletion region that grows with time.\n\nHowever, even with vigorous stirring, there is a very thin layer of stagnant solution immediately adjacent to the electrode surface, known as the Nernst diffusion layer (or hydrodynamic boundary layer), with a fixed thickness, $\\delta$. Within this thin layer, mass transport still occurs by diffusion. The crucial difference is that convection maintains the concentration of $R$ at its bulk value, $C_R^*$, at the outer edge of this thin layer (at distance $x=\\delta$).\n\nAs the potential is swept into the region where the oxidation of $R$ is very fast, the surface concentration $C_R(x=0)$ is driven to essentially zero. At this point, the reaction rate is limited only by how fast the reactant can be brought to the surface. The concentration gradient across the Nernst diffusion layer becomes constant and maximal: $(C_R(x=\\delta) - C_R(x=0)) / \\delta = (C_R^* - 0) / \\delta = C_R^*/\\delta$. According to Fick's first law, the flux $J$ is proportional to the gradient, $J = D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Since the gradient is now constant (because both $\\delta$ and $C_R^*$ are constant), the flux becomes constant.\n\nConsequently, the current, which is directly proportional to the flux ($i = nFAJ$, where $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $A$ is the electrode area), does not peak and decay. Instead, it rises as the potential activates the reaction and then reaches a constant plateau value, known as the limiting current, $i_L$.\n$$i_L = nFAD \\frac{C_R^*}{\\delta}$$\nThis plateau represents the maximum rate at which mass transport can supply the reactant to the electrode under these hydrodynamic conditions. The overall shape of the current-potential curve is no longer a peak but a sigmoidal (S-shaped) wave, characteristic of steady-state hydrodynamic voltammetry techniques.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of stirring fundamentally changes the mass transport regime from transient diffusion to steady-state convection-diffusion, which in turn transforms the voltammogram from a peaked shape to a sigmoidal shape with a limiting current plateau.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA is incorrect because the peak shape is lost.\nB is correct as it accurately describes the transition to a sigmoidal shape with a steady-state limiting current.\nC is incorrect because the current does not decay more rapidly; it reaches a steady state.\nD is incorrect. Stirring enhances, rather than prevents, mass transport to the electrode, leading to a significant current.\nE is incorrect because in this type of experiment (for a reversible system at potentials beyond the initial rise), the current is almost always limited by mass transport, not the intrinsic rate of electron transfer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1569605"}, {"introduction": "Beyond studying species dissolved in solution, voltammetry is an essential technique for characterizing molecules attached to an electrode surface.
