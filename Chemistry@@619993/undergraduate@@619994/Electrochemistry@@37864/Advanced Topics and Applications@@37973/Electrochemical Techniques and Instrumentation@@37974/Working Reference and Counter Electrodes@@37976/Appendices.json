This setup utilizes a device called a potentiostat to precisely control the experimental conditions. The three electrodes are the Working Electrode (WE), where the reaction of interest occurs; the Reference Electrode (RE), which provides a stable potential for comparison; and the Counter Electrode (CE), also known as the auxiliary electrode, which completes the circuit.\n\nThe fundamental principle of a potentiostat is to maintain a user-defined potential difference between the Working Electrode and the Reference Electrode. It achieves this by dynamically adjusting the voltage applied to the Counter Electrode. For the Reference Electrode to maintain its stable potential, it is crucial that negligible current passes through it. The main current required to drive the electrochemical reaction at the WE must therefore flow through a different path.\n\nGiven these roles, which of the following statements accurately describes the functional connections and current flow in a standard three-electrode potentiostatic experiment?\n\nA. The potentiostat measures the potential difference between the Working Electrode and the Reference Electrode. To maintain this potential at a setpoint, it adjusts the voltage of the Counter Electrode. Consequently, the primary electrochemical current flows in a circuit between the Working Electrode and the Counter Electrode, while essentially no current flows through the Reference Electrode.\n\nB. The potentiostat measures the potential difference between the Working Electrode and the Counter Electrode. To maintain this potential, it adjusts the voltage of the Reference Electrode. The primary electrochemical current flows in a circuit between the Working Electrode and the Reference Electrode.\n\nC. The potentiostat measures the potential difference between the Reference Electrode and the Counter Electrode. To keep this potential constant, it adjusts the voltage on the Working Electrode. The primary current flows between the Counter Electrode and the Reference Electrode.\n\nD. The three electrodes are connected in series to the potentiostat. The potentiostat drives a current through the series circuit and measures the potential drop between the Working Electrode and the Reference Electrode. The Counter Electrode's role is simply to complete this series connection.\n\nE. The potentiostat applies a fixed voltage between the Working Electrode and a Counter Electrode. It then measures the potential of the Reference Electrode to determine the reaction rate. The primary electrochemical current flows from the Working Electrode to the Reference Electrode.", "solution": "Define the electrode potentials relative to a common reference as $\\phi_{WE}$, $\\phi_{RE}$, and $\\phi_{CE}$ for the Working, Reference, and Counter electrodes, respectively. In a potentiostatic experiment, the control objective is to set and maintain the potential difference between the Working and Reference electrodes at a user-defined setpoint $E_{set}$:\n$$\nE_{WE-RE} \\equiv \\phi_{WE} - \\phi_{RE} = E_{set}.\n$$\nA potentiostat measures $E_{WE-RE}$ using a high-impedance input connected to the Reference Electrode so that essentially no current flows through the Reference Electrode. Denote the currents at the three electrodes by $I_{WE}$, $I_{RE}$, and $I_{CE}$, with the sign convention that currents entering the electrolyte from the potentiostat are positive. Kirchhoff’s current law at the cell requires\n$$\nI_{WE} + I_{RE} + I_{CE} = 0.\n$$\nBecause the Reference Electrode input is high impedance, one has\n$$\nI_{RE} \\approx 0,\n$$\nso the main current path is between the Working and Counter electrodes, giving\n$$\nI_{WE} \\approx - I_{CE}.\n$$\nTo enforce $E_{WE-RE} = E_{set}$ under changing reaction conditions at the Working Electrode, the potentiostat adjusts the Counter Electrode potential $\\phi_{CE}$ (through its power output) so that the resulting current through the electrolyte shifts $\\phi_{WE}$ appropriately while leaving $\\phi_{RE}$ undisturbed. Thus, the functional connections are: sense the potential between Working and Reference, drive the Counter to control the Working potential relative to the Reference, and keep the Reference at negligible current.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Option A states that the potentiostat measures the WE–RE potential, adjusts the CE voltage to maintain it, and that the primary current flows between WE and CE with essentially no current through RE. This matches the analysis above.\n- Option B incorrectly claims the potentiostat measures WE–CE and adjusts the RE voltage; furthermore it incorrectly places the main current between WE and RE, which contradicts $I_{RE} \\approx 0$.\n- Option C incorrectly measures RE–CE, adjusts the WE voltage directly, and asserts primary current between CE and RE, contradicting the required negligible $I_{RE}$.\n- Option D incorrectly treats the three electrodes as a series current path; the Reference Electrode is not part of the current-carrying loop.\n- Option E incorrectly applies a fixed WE–CE voltage rather than controlling WE–RE, and incorrectly states that primary current flows to the Reference Electrode.\n\nTherefore, only Option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1601220"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical knowledge is put to the test when practical mistakes occur. This thought experiment simulates a common but critical setup error: swapping the reference and counter electrode leads. Analyzing the consequences will deepen your appreciation for the distinct and non-interchangeable roles of these two electrodes, highlighting why the high-impedance sensing circuit must be separate from the current-carrying circuit [@problem_id:1601190].", "problem": "An electrochemistry student is setting up a three-electrode cell to study the oxidation of a compound in solution. The setup consists of a Working Electrode (WE), where the reaction of interest occurs; a stable silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) Reference Electrode (RE), which provides a constant potential reference; and a platinum wire Counter Electrode (CE), which serves to complete the electrical circuit.\n\nThe potentiostat, the instrument controlling the experiment, operates via a feedback loop. It measures the potential difference between the WE and the RE and adjusts the potential of the CE to maintain the desired WE vs. RE potential. The cell current flows between the WE and the CE, while ideally, no current flows through the RE.\n\nIn a moment of haste, the student incorrectly connects the potentiostat's leads. The lead designated for the RE is connected to the CE, and the lead designated for the CE is connected to the RE. The WE is connected correctly. The student then initiates a potential scan, intending to sweep the WE potential from a starting value to a final value.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the immediate consequence of this incorrect connection when the experiment begins?\n\nA. The experiment will fail because no current can flow. The potentiostat will attempt to apply voltage to the RE, but the RE's high internal impedance will prevent any current from passing to the WE, resulting in a reading of zero current.\n\nB. The experiment will fail because the potentiostat will try to control the potential difference between the WE and the CE. To do this, it will apply a large and potentially damaging voltage to the actual RE, causing the control amplifier to saturate at its compliance voltage limit.\n\nC. The experiment will proceed, but all measured potentials will be incorrect. The shape of the resulting voltammogram will be recognizable, but shifted along the potential axis due to the stable, but different, open-circuit potential of the platinum CE.\n\nD. The experiment will fail because the WE potential will become unstable and oscillate rapidly. The potentiostat will be trying to control two independent variables (WE-CE potential and CE-RE potential) with only one output, leading to an unstable feedback condition.", "solution": "Define the intended control variable and current paths in a correctly wired three-electrode potentiostat:\n- The potentiostat enforces $E_{\\text{WE-RE}}=E_{\\text{set}}$ via a high-gain feedback loop that senses the potential difference between the working electrode (WE) and the reference electrode (RE), and drives the counter electrode (CE).\n- The measurement input at RE is high impedance, so $I_{\\text{RE}} \\approx 0$ ideally.\n- The cell current $I$ flows between WE and CE, so $I_{\\text{cell}}=I_{\\text{WE-CE}}$.\n\nNow label the potentials (all defined as WE minus the other node):\n$$E_{\\text{WE-RE}}= \\phi_{\\text{WE}} - \\phi_{\\text{RE}}, \\quad E_{\\text{WE-CE}}=\\phi_{\\text{WE}}-\\phi_{\\text{CE}}.$$\n\nConsider the incorrect wiring described:\n- The potentiostat’s RE sense lead is connected to the actual CE, so the sensed potential becomes $E_{\\text{WE-CE}}$.\n- The potentiostat’s CE drive lead is connected to the actual RE, so the output current is driven through the reference electrode.\n- The actual CE is connected only to the high-impedance sense input; thus $I_{\\text{CE}} \\approx 0$ and the CE floats at its open-circuit potential, denoted $E_{\\text{CE}}^{\\text{oc}}$ relative to the solution.\n\nConsequences for control and current paths:\n1) The feedback loop now enforces\n$$E_{\\text{WE-CE}} \\to E_{\\text{set}},$$\ni.e., it tries to make $\\phi_{\\text{WE}}-\\phi_{\\text{CE}}=E_{\\text{set}}$, while sensing $\\phi_{\\text{CE}}$ through a high-impedance input. Since no current flows to the CE, $\\phi_{\\text{CE}}$ remains near its open-circuit value $E_{\\text{CE}}^{\\text{oc}}$.\n2) The potentiostat therefore adjusts its output to drive current between WE and the electrode attached to the drive lead, which is the actual RE. Hence the cell current now flows WE $\\leftrightarrow$ RE:\n$$I_{\\text{cell}} \\approx I_{\\text{WE-RE}}, \\quad I_{\\text{CE}} \\approx 0.$$\n\nElectrical and electrochemical implications of using the RE as counter:\n- A reference electrode is not designed to carry significant current; it has a substantial series resistance (through the junction and internal frit), denote this by $R_{\\text{RE}}$, and exhibits polarization under current. The voltage that the potentiostat must deliver to force the desired $E_{\\text{WE-CE}}$ is increased by the drop across $R_{\\text{RE}}$ and by overpotentials at the RE interface.\n- For a demanded current $I$, the required output voltage can be approximated as\n$$V_{\\text{out}} \\approx I R_{\\text{RE}} + \\eta_{\\text{RE}} + \\text{other drops},$$\nwhere $\\eta_{\\text{RE}}$ represents the polarization of the RE when misused as a current-carrying electrode. Because $R_{\\text{RE}}$ and $\\eta_{\\text{RE}}$ can be large, $V_{\\text{out}}$ often exceeds the potentiostat’s compliance limit, causing the control amplifier to saturate.\n\nImmediate outcome:\n- The feedback loop is still single-variable (it enforces $E_{\\text{WE-CE}}$), so there is no inherent two-loop instability, but it accomplishes this by driving current through the actual RE. This frequently forces a large and potentially damaging voltage and current through the RE, leading to amplifier saturation at the compliance limit and failure to maintain the intended setpoint.\n- Therefore the most accurate description of the immediate consequence is that the potentiostat attempts to control WE versus CE by driving the RE, likely reaching compliance and risking damage to the reference electrode.\n\nThis matches statement B and rules out the others:\n- A is incorrect because a reference electrode can conduct; its impedance is high but not infinite, so current does not necessarily drop to zero.\n- C is misleading as a general immediate consequence; while the sensed potential is versus the CE, the misuse of the RE as counter typically forces large drops and polarization, leading to saturation/failure rather than a simple potential shift.\n- D is incorrect because the potentiostat still controls a single measured potential difference with one output; instability from “two independent variables” is not the primary issue here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1601190"}, {"introduction": "Even with a correctly wired cell, the physical properties of the electrolyte can distort experimental results.
