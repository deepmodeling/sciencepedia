During charging, lithium ions ($\\text{Li}^+$) must intercalate into the layered structure of graphite. If the solvent molecules are too large, they can co-intercalate with the lithium ions and physically force the graphite layers apart, a destructive process known as exfoliation. This prevents the formation of a stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI), a passivating layer necessary for long-term battery performance.\n\nAn electrochemical engineer is evaluating two common solvents, Ethylene Carbonate (EC) and Propylene Carbonate (PC), for use with a graphite anode. The interlayer spacing of the graphite is $d_\\text{graphite} = 3.35 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n\nTo assess the risk of exfoliation, a simplified geometric model is used. The model assumes that a lithium ion complexes with a single solvent molecule, and this entire complex attempts to fit between the graphite layers. The total size of this complex, perpendicular to the graphite planes, is approximated as the sum of the lithium ion's radius and the effective thickness of the solvent molecule. Exfoliation is predicted to occur if this total size exceeds the graphite's interlayer spacing.\n\nThe relevant physical parameters are:\n- Ionic radius of a lithium ion, $r_{\\text{Li}^+} = 0.76 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n- Effective thickness of an EC molecule, $t_\\text{EC} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n- Effective thickness of a PC molecule, $t_\\text{PC} = 3.60 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n\nBased on this model and the provided data, which of the following statements correctly assesses the viability of these solvents for stable operation with a graphite anode?\n\nA. Both EC and PC are suitable, as the $[\\text{Li(solvent)}]^+$ complex is smaller than the graphite interlayer spacing for both, preventing exfoliation.\n\nB. Neither EC nor PC is suitable, as the $[\\text{Li(solvent)}]^+$ complex is larger than the graphite interlayer spacing for both, guaranteeing exfoliation.\n\nC. EC is suitable while PC is not. The complex formed with EC is small enough to fit within the graphite layers, whereas the complex with PC is too large and would cause exfoliation.\n\nD. PC is suitable while EC is not. The complex formed with PC is small enough to fit within the graphite layers, whereas the complex with EC is too large and would cause exfoliation.\n\nE.

The growth of this layer consumes electrolyte and active material, impacting the battery's long-term performance. Consider a simplified one-dimensional model for the growth of a planar SEI layer.\n\nThe growth is assumed to be limited by the diffusion of a single reactive species from the bulk electrolyte through the existing SEI layer to the anode surface, where it is consumed instantaneously upon arrival. The concentration of this reactive species in the bulk electrolyte, far from the anode, is constant and denoted by $C_b$. The diffusion of this species through the SEI material is characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nThe reaction at the anode surface converts the diffusing species into the solid SEI material.

The rate of growth of the layer's thickness, $\\frac{dL}{dt}$, is determined by the rate at which the reactive species arrives at the anode surface. This arrival rate is given by the molar flux, $J$, of the species through the SEI layer.\n\nThe volumetric growth rate per unit area is equal to the flux $J$ (in units of $\\text{mol m}^{-2} \\text{ s}^{-1}$) multiplied by the volume of SEI material produced per mole of the consumed reactant species. We are given that $n$ moles of the reactive species are required to form one mole of the SEI product, which has a molar volume $V_m$.

We can use Fick's first law to describe the flux $J$. For a one-dimensional system, Fick's law is $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$. With a linear concentration profile across the layer of thickness $L(t)$, the concentration gradient can be approximated as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x}$.\n\nThe concentration at the electrolyte-SEI interface (let's say at $x=L$) is $C(L) = C_b$.\nThe concentration at the anode-SEI interface (at $x=0$) is $C(0) = 0$.\nThe change in concentration is $\\Delta C = C(0) - C(L) = 0 - C_b = -C_b$.\nThe distance over which this change occurs is $\\Delta x = L - 0 = L$.\n\nSo, the concentration gradient is $\\frac{dC}{dx} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-C_b}{L}$.\nSubstituting this into Fick's law, the magnitude of the flux is:\n$$\nJ = -D \\left( \\frac{-C_b}{L(t)} \\right) = \\frac{D C_b}{L(t)}\n$$\n\nNow we substitute this expression for the flux $J$ back into our equation for the growth rate of the thickness:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{D C_b}{L(t)} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{V_m}{n}\n$$\n\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation.
