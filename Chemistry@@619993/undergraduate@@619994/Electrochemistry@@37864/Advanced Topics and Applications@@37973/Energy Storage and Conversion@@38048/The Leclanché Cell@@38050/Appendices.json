Based on the simplified overall electrochemical reaction for this process, what is the fundamental stoichiometric mole ratio of zinc metal consumed to manganese(IV) oxide consumed?

We will do this by writing and balancing the two half-reactions separately and then combining them.\n\nFirst, we consider the oxidation half-reaction at the anode. The problem states that zinc metal ($\\text{Zn}$) is oxidized to zinc ions ($\\text{Zn}^{2+}$).\nThe unbalanced reaction is:\n$$ \\text{Zn}(s) \\to \\text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) $$\nThe zinc atoms are balanced. To balance the charge, we must add two electrons ($e^-$) to the product side, as the charge on the left is 0 and on the right is +2.\nThe balanced oxidation half-reaction is:\n$$ \\text{Anode (Oxidation): } \\text{Zn}(s) \\to \\text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} $$\n\nNext, we consider the reduction half-reaction at the cathode. The problem states that manganese(IV) oxide ($\\text{MnO}_2$) is reduced in the presence of ammonium ions ($\\text{NH}_4^+$) to form manganese(III) oxide ($\\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3$), ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$), and water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\nThe unbalanced reaction with the specified reactants and products is:\n$$ \\text{MnO}_2(s) + \\text{NH}_4^{+}(aq) \\to \\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + \\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) $$\nWe balance this equation step-by-step:\n1.  Balance the manganese (Mn) atoms. There is one Mn on the left and two on the right. We place a coefficient of 2 in front of $\\text{MnO}_2$:\n    $$ 2\\text{MnO}_2(s) + \\text{NH}_4^{+}(aq) \\to \\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + \\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) $$\n2.  Balance the nitrogen (N) atoms. There is one N on the left and one on the right. To facilitate balancing other atoms later, let's consider the source of the products. The $\\text{NH}_4^+$ is the source of $\\text{NH}_3$. Let's try balancing N by adding a coefficient of 2 in front of $\\text{NH}_4^+$ and $\\text{NH}_3$:\n    $$ 2\\text{MnO}_2(s) + 2\\text{NH}_4^{+}(aq) \\to \\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + 2\\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) $$\n    Now, N is balanced.\n3.  Balance the oxygen (O) atoms. On the left, we have $2 \\times 2 = 4$ oxygen atoms. On the right, we have $3 + 1 = 4$ oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms are balanced.\n4.  Balance the hydrogen (H) atoms. On the left, we have $2 \\times 4 = 8$ hydrogen atoms. On the right, we have $(2 \\times 3) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8$ hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms are balanced.\n5.  Balance the charge. On the left, the total charge is $2 \\times (+1) = +2$. On the right, all species are neutral, so the total charge is 0. To balance the charge, we must add two electrons ($e^-$) to the side with the higher charge, which is the left side.\nThe balanced reduction half-reaction is:\n$$ \\text{Cathode (Reduction): } 2\\text{MnO}_2(s) + 2\\text{NH}_4^{+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\to \\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + 2\\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) $$\n\nNow, we combine the two balanced half-reactions to get the overall cell reaction. The number of electrons lost in oxidation (2) is equal to the number of electrons gained in reduction (2), so we can add the two equations directly.\n$$ \\text{Zn}(s) \\to \\text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} $$\n$$ 2\\text{MnO}_2(s) + 2\\text{NH}_4^{+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\to \\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + 2\\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) $$\nAdding these and canceling the electrons on both sides gives the overall balanced reaction:\n$$ \\text{Overall: } \\text{Zn}(s) + 2\\text{MnO}_2(s) + 2\\text{NH}_4^{+}(aq) \\to \\text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \\text{Mn}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + 2\\text{NH}_3(aq) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the stoichiometric mole ratio of zinc metal consumed to manganese(IV) oxide consumed. Looking at the reactants in the overall balanced equation, we can see that the stoichiometric coefficient for $\\text{Zn}$ is 1 and for $\\text{MnO}_2$ is 2.\nThis means that for every 1 mole of $\\text{Zn}$ consumed, 2 moles of $\\text{MnO}_2$ are consumed.\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{moles of Zn consumed}}{\\text{moles of MnO}_2 \\text{ consumed}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nAs a single numerical value, this ratio is 0.5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "1595448"}, {"introduction": "With a balanced reaction, we can now predict a battery's practical limits based on the amount of material it contains.
