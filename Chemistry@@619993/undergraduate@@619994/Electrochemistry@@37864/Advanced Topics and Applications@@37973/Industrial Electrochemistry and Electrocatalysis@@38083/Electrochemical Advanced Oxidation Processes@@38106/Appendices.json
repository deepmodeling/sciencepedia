Using the standard assignments $+1$ for hydrogen and $-2$ for oxygen, and the fact that the molecule is neutral, we write\n$$x + 2\\cdot(+1) + 2\\cdot(-2) = 0 \\implies x + 2 - 4 = 0 \\implies x = +2.$$\nIn carbon dioxide $CO_{2}$, the oxidation state of carbon is\n$$x + 2\\cdot(-2) = 0 \\implies x = +4.$$\nThus, carbon goes from $+2$ in $HCOOH$ to $+4$ in $CO_{2}$, an increase of $2$ units, corresponding to the loss of $2$ electrons per molecule of formic acid.\n\nThis can be confirmed by balancing the oxidation half-reaction in acidic medium:\n$$\\mathrm{HCOOH} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO_{2}} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}} + 2\\,\\mathrm{e^{-}}.$$\nAtom balances: C: $1\\to 1$, O: $2\\to 2$, H: $2\\to 2$ (on right as $2\\,\\mathrm{H^{+}}$).
