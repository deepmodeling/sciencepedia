This often results in a characteristic \"volcano-shaped\" curve when plotting catalytic activity against a descriptor like adsorption energy.\n\nLet's model a simplified surface-catalyzed reaction involving a single reactant species, A. The first step is the reversible adsorption of a gas-phase molecule A onto a vacant surface site, denoted by $*$, according to the equilibrium:\n$A(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons A^*$\n\nThe fractional surface coverage of the adsorbed species, $\\theta$, is described by the Langmuir isotherm model. The equilibrium for this process is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption, $\\Delta G_{ads}$, the partial pressure of A, $p_A$, and the absolute temperature, $T$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = \\frac{p_A}{p^\\circ} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{ads}}{RT}\\right) $$\nwhere $p^\\circ$ is the standard pressure and $R$ is the molar gas constant.\n\nThe overall catalytic activity, $\\mathcal{A}$, which is proportional to the reaction rate, is controlled by different factors depending on the adsorption strength:\n\n1.  **Weak-Binding Limit**: When adsorption is weak (i.e., $\\Delta G_{ads}$ is not strongly negative), the surface has low coverage. The activity is limited by the amount of adsorbed reactant and is thus directly proportional to the surface coverage: $\\mathcal{A} = k_1 \\theta$, where $k_1$ is a constant.\n\n2.  **Strong-Binding Limit**: When adsorption is very strong (i.e., $\\Delta G_{ads}$ is highly negative), the surface is nearly saturated. A subsequent reaction step requires a free site, making the activity limited by the availability of vacant sites. Thus, the activity is proportional to the fraction of vacant sites, $(1-\\theta)$: $\\mathcal{A} = k_2 (1-\\theta)$, where $k_2$ is another constant.\n\nIn both of these limiting regimes, the natural logarithm of the activity, $\\ln(\\mathcal{A})$, can be approximated as a linear function of the adsorption energy: $\\ln(\\mathcal{A}) \\approx m \\cdot \\Delta G_{ads} + C$, where $C$ is a constant that depends on temperature, pressure, and the kinetic constants.\n\nYour task is to determine the slopes of this linear relationship for both the weak-binding regime ($m_{weak}$) and the strong-binding regime ($m_{strong}$).\n\nCalculate the numerical values of $m_{weak}$ and $m_{strong}$ at a temperature of $T = 300 \\, \\text{K}$.
