An Evans diagram is a plot of potential (y-axis) versus the logarithm of current density (x-axis) for the anodic and cathodic half-reactions involved in a corrosion process. The intersection of the anodic and cathodic polarization curves determines the corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$) and the corrosion current ($i_{corr}$), where the latter is directly proportional to the corrosion rate.\n\n**Case 1: Copper in Deaerated Acid**\n\nIn the initial scenario, the copper component is in a deaerated acidic solution. The possible electrochemical reactions are:\n1.  Anodic reaction (oxidation of copper): $Cu \\rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-}$\n2.  Cathodic reaction (reduction of protons): $2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow H_2$\n\nTo determine if corrosion is spontaneous, we must compare the equilibrium potentials of these two half-reactions under the given conditions. The anodic polarization curve originates at the equilibrium potential for the copper reaction, $E_{eq,Cu}$, and the potential increases as the anodic current increases. The cathodic polarization curve originates at the equilibrium potential for the hydrogen reaction, $E_{eq,H}$, and the potential decreases as the cathodic current increases.\n\nThe equilibrium potential for the hydrogen electrode at pH 1 ([$H^+$] = $10^{-1}$ M) can be calculated using the Nernst equation (at 298 K, and assuming hydrogen partial pressure $P_{H_2} = 1$ atm):\n$$E_{eq,H} = E^0_{H^{+}/H_2} - \\frac{0.0592}{2}\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{H_2}}{[H^{+}]^2}\\right)$$\n$$E_{eq,H} = 0.00 \\text{ V} - \\frac{0.0592}{2}\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{(10^{-1})^2}\\right) = -0.0296 \\log_{10}(100) = -0.0592 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe equilibrium potential for the copper electrode, $E_{eq,Cu}$, depends on the concentration of $Cu^{2+}$ ions. However, its standard potential is $E^0_{Cu^{2+}/Cu} = +0.34 \\text{ V}$. For any reasonable (non-zero) concentration of $Cu^{2+}$, the equilibrium potential $E_{eq,Cu}$ will be a positive value close to $+0.34$ V.\n\nCritically, we see that $E_{eq,Cu} > E_{eq,H}$. For spontaneous corrosion to occur, the equilibrium potential of the oxidant (cathode) must be greater than the equilibrium potential of the reductant (anode). Here, the potential of the metal (Cu) is higher than that of the cathodic species ($H^+$). Therefore, copper is thermodynamically stable in deaerated, non-oxidizing acid. The corrosion rate is negligible ($i_{corr} \\approx 0$), and the potential of the copper piece is simply its rest potential, which is effectively $E_{eq,Cu}$.\n\n**Case 2: Copper in Acid with Aqueous Bromine**\n\nWhen aqueous bromine ($Br_2(aq)$) is added, a new, powerful oxidizing agent is introduced. We now have two possible cathodic reactions: the reduction of $H^+$ and the reduction of $Br_2$.\n1.  Anodic reaction: $Cu \\rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-}$ (unchanged)\n2.  Cathodic reaction 1: $2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow H_2$ (unchanged)\n3.  Cathodic reaction 2: $Br_2 + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow 2Br^{-}$\n\nThe standard reduction potential for the bromine reaction is $E^0_{Br_2/Br^{-}} = +1.09 \\text{ V}$. This is significantly higher than the standard potential for both the hydrogen reaction ($0.00$ V) and the copper reaction ($+0.34$ V). Since kinetics are assumed to be facile, the cathodic process will be overwhelmingly dominated by the reduction of bromine because it has a much higher reduction potential.\n\nWe now construct the new Evans diagram. The anodic curve for copper is the same as before. The new dominant cathodic curve is that for bromine reduction. This curve starts at the high equilibrium potential $E_{eq,Br}$ (near $+1.09$ V) and slopes downwards.\n\nThe new corrosion potential, $E'_{corr}$, and corrosion current, $i'_{corr}$, are found at the intersection of the copper anodic curve and the bromine cathodic curve.\n-   **Potential Change**: The anodic curve for copper starts at $E_{eq,Cu} \\approx +0.34$ V and has a positive slope. The cathodic curve for bromine starts at $E_{eq,Br} > +0.34$ V and has a negative slope. Their intersection, $E'_{corr}$, must therefore occur at a potential between $E_{eq,Cu}$ and $E_{eq,Br}$. Thus, the new corrosion potential $E'_{corr}$ is significantly higher than the initial negligible-corrosion potential $E_{corr} \\approx E_{eq,Cu}$. So, the corrosion potential increases.\n-   **Rate Change**: In the first case, the corrosion current $i_{corr}$ was negligible. In the second case, the intersection of the copper and bromine curves occurs at a current value, $i'_{corr}$, that is significantly greater than zero. This means the rate of copper dissolution, which is proportional to this current, increases dramatically.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe addition of the strong oxidizing agent, bromine, introduces a new cathodic reaction with a much higher equilibrium potential than that of copper. This leads to a new corrosion system where the corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$) is elevated to a value between the equilibrium potentials of copper and bromine, and the corrosion current ($i_{corr}$), and thus the corrosion rate, increases from a negligible value to a significant one. Therefore, both the corrosion potential and the corrosion rate increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1560280"}, {"introduction": "Corrosion science extends beyond simple, uniform attack to complex phenomena like passivation and localized corrosion, where Evans diagrams remain a powerful analytical tool.

You will use the diagram to visualize how shifting the corrosion potential can inadvertently create conditions for intense pitting, a non-intuitive result with severe practical consequences.", "problem": "A specific type of steel alloy is used in an industrial process where it is exposed to a neutral, aerated aqueous solution. In this environment, the steel undergoes corrosion. The primary anodic reaction is the dissolution of the metal, and the primary cathodic reaction is the reduction of dissolved oxygen. The anodic polarization behavior of this steel is characterized by an active dissolution region, followed by passivation that begins at a passivation potential, $E_p$. However, the protective passive film is susceptible to localized breakdown and pitting corrosion if the potential rises above a critical pitting potential, $E_{pitt}$. For this system, the initial corrosion potential, $E_{corr}$, is well below both $E_p$ and $E_{pitt}$ (i.e., $E_{corr} < E_p < E_{pitt}$).\n\nTo mitigate corrosion, an anodic inhibitor is introduced into the solution. Anodic inhibitors function by adsorbing onto the metal surface, facilitating the formation of a passive film and thereby increasing the potential at which the anodic reaction occurs. A common concern with anodic inhibitors is the risk associated with using an insufficient concentration.\n\nConsider a scenario where an insufficient amount of this anodic inhibitor is added to the system. The amount is just enough to shift the corrosion potential to a new value, $E'_{corr}$, such that it falls into the region between the passivation potential and the pitting potential, i.e., $E_p < E'_{corr} < E_{pitt}$.\n\nBased on the principles of corrosion electrochemistry and the function of anodic inhibitors, which of the following statements most accurately and completely describes the primary danger of this specific scenario?\n\nA. The steel becomes thermodynamically immune to corrosion, and all corrosion processes cease.\n\nB. The corrosion rate increases dramatically and uniformly across the entire surface of the steel.\n\nC. The overall corrosion rate, as measured by total mass loss, decreases significantly, leading to safe and uniform protection of the steel.\n\nD. The corrosion potential of the steel remains at its original value, $E_{corr}$, but the corrosion current density is significantly reduced.\n\nE. While the overall corrosion rate averaged over the surface may be low, the conditions promote the initiation of intense, localized pitting corrosion, which can lead to rapid perforation and structural failure.\n\nF. The addition of the inhibitor stops the cathodic reaction (oxygen reduction), thereby halting the corrosion process without affecting the anodic reaction.", "solution": "The anodic dissolution of steel in a neutral, aerated aqueous solution is described by the anodic branch $i_{a}(E)$, with an active region that transitions at the passivation potential $E_{p}$ into a passive region characterized by a near-constant passive current density $i_{pass}$. The cathodic branch $i_{c}(E)$ is dominated by dissolved oxygen reduction. According to mixed-potential theory, the corrosion potential $E_{corr}$ satisfies the current-balance condition\n$$\ni_{a}(E_{corr}) = i_{c}(E_{corr}).\n$$\nInitially, the system has $E_{corr} < E_{p} < E_{pitt}$, so the mixed potential lies in the active region and corrosion is predominantly uniform.\n\nAn anodic inhibitor adsorbs on the surface and facilitates passive film formation, shifting the anodic polarization curve to higher potentials and lowering the active dissolution rate. If an insufficient inhibitor dose is added such that the new mixed potential moves to $E'_{corr}$ with\n$$\nE_{p} < E'_{corr} < E_{pitt},\n$$\nthen the intersection of $i_{a}(E)$ and $i_{c}(E)$ occurs on the passive branch. In that case the uniform corrosion rate becomes small because\n$$\ni_{a}(E'_{corr}) \\approx i_{pass} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad i_{pass} \\ll i_{a} \\text{ (active)},\n$$\nso the average metal loss decreases.\n\nHowever, this condition introduces a specific danger intrinsic to insufficient anodic inhibition. The predominantly passive surface serves as a large-area cathode for oxygen reduction, while any defect, inclusion, or locally unprotected spot that fails to passivate remains an active anodic site. Let $A_{c}$ denote the cathodic (passive) area and $A_{a}$ the residual active anodic area; by overall current balance at $E'_{corr}$,\n$$\nA_{c}\\, i_{c}(E'_{corr}) = A_{a}\\, i_{a,\\text{local}}(E'_{corr}),\n$$\nso that\n$$\ni_{a,\\text{local}}(E'_{corr}) = \\frac{A_{c}}{A_{a}}\\, i_{c}(E'_{corr}).\n$$\nBecause $A_{c} \\gg A_{a}$ when only small regions remain active, the local anodic current density $i_{a,\\text{local}}$ becomes very large, causing intense localized dissolution. Moreover, although $E'_{corr} < E_{pitt}$ globally, pit initiation and growth are facilitated by the elevated potential and the large cathode-to-anode area ratio; once a pit nucleates, occluded chemistry inside the pit (acidification and aggressive ion concentration) lowers the local stability threshold and sustains rapid penetration even below the nominal $E_{pitt}$ for the bulk environment.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is false: passivity is not thermodynamic immunity; corrosion can proceed, especially locally.\n- B is false: uniform corrosion does not increase; it typically decreases due to passivation.\n- C is incomplete/misleading: although average mass loss decreases, protection is not uniformly safe because localized attack is promoted.\n- D is false: $E_{corr}$ shifts to $E'_{corr}$; it does not remain at $E_{corr}$.\n- F is false: anodic inhibitors act on the anodic process; they do not stop the cathodic oxygen reduction.\n\nThe primary danger is severe localized pitting with low overall average corrosion rate, potentially leading to rapid perforation and structural failure, which is most accurately described by option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1560352"}]}
