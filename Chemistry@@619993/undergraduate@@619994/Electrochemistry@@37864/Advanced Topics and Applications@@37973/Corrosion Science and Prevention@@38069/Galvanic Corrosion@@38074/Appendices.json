[@problem_id:1563344]", "problem": "To prevent corrosion of a ship's steel hull, which is primarily iron (Fe), blocks of a more electrochemically active metal are attached to it. This technique, a form of cathodic protection, causes the attached metal to act as a sacrificial anode, corroding in place of the steel. Consider a scenario where a large block of zinc (Zn) is attached to the hull of a ship. The seawater acts as the electrolyte, completing an electrochemical cell between the zinc and the iron.\n\nGiven the following standard reduction potentials at 298 K:\n$Fe^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Fe(s)$ with $E^\\circ = -0.440$ V\n$Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Zn(s)$ with $E^\\circ = -0.763$ V\n\nCalculate the initial standard electromotive force (EMF), also known as the standard cell potential ($E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$), generated by this galvanic cell.

A galvanic cell is a spontaneous electrochemical cell, which means the overall cell potential must be positive. The standard cell potential is calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cells involved.\n\nFirst, we must identify which metal serves as the anode (where oxidation occurs) and which serves as the cathode (where reduction occurs). In a galvanic cell, the half-reaction with the more negative (or less positive) standard reduction potential will proceed as an oxidation. This electrode is the anode. The half-reaction with the less negative (or more positive) standard reduction potential will proceed as a reduction. This electrode is the cathode.\n\nThe given standard reduction potentials are:\n$E^\\circ(\\text{Fe}^{2+}/\\text{Fe}) = -0.440$ V\n$E^\\circ(\\text{Zn}^{2+}/\\text{Zn}) = -0.763$ V\n\nComparing the two values, we see that $-0.763 < -0.440$. Therefore, the zinc half-reaction has a greater tendency to be reversed (i.e., for Zn to be oxidized). This means zinc will act as the anode, and iron will act as the cathode. This is consistent with the problem's description of zinc being a \"sacrificial anode\" to protect the iron hull.\n\nThe half-reactions at each electrode are as follows:\nAnode (Oxidation): $Zn(s) \\rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-}$\nCathode (Reduction): $Fe^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Fe(s)$\n\nThe standard cell potential, $E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, can be calculated using the formula:\n$$E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = E^\\circ_{\\text{cathode}} - E^\\circ_{\\text{anode}}$$\nwhere $E^\\circ_{\\text{cathode}}$ and $E^\\circ_{\\text{anode}}$ are the standard *reduction* potentials of the respective half-cells.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\nThe cathode is iron, so $E^\\circ_{\\text{cathode}} = E^\\circ(\\text{Fe}^{2+}/\\text{Fe}) = -0.440$ V.\nThe anode is zinc, so $E^\\circ_{\\text{anode}} = E^\\circ(\\text{Zn}^{2+}/\\text{Zn}) = -0.763$ V.\n\n$$E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = (-0.440 \\text{ V}) - (-0.763 \\text{ V})$$\n$$E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = -0.440 \\text{ V} + 0.763 \\text{ V}$$\n$$E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = 0.323 \\text{ V}$$\n\nThe calculated standard cell potential is $0.323$ V. The positive sign confirms that the reaction is spontaneous, as expected for a galvanic cell designed for corrosion protection. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
