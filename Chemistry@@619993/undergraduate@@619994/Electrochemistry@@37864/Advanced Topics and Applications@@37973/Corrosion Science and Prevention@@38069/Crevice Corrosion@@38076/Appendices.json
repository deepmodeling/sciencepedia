For fixed local alkalinity near the cathode, a decrease in $a_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ increases the logarithmic term and therefore decreases $E_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, shifting the local mixed potential in the negative direction. Thus, inside the crevice (Region 1) where $a_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is low, the local cathodic oxygen reduction is suppressed and the equilibrium potential is lower (more active), predisposing this area to act as the anode relative to the well-aerated Region 2.\n\nBy mixed potential theory and galvanic coupling through the continuous steel, the region with lower oxygen access (Region 1) cannot sustain the necessary cathodic current density; it therefore supplies anodic current via iron dissolution. Electrons produced in Region 1 flow through the metal to Region 2, where oxygen reduction proceeds due to the higher $a_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The electrolyte (seawater) closes the circuit via ionic current.

Corrosion is not uniformly distributed (contradicting uniform attack), nor is it confined only to the precise boundary; rather, it localizes within and just inside the crevice, driven by the differential aeration.
