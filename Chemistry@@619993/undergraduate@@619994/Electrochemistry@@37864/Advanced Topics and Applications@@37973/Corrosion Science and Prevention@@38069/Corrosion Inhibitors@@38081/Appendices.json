The objective is to quantify its effectiveness in protecting mild steel components within an acidic industrial cleaning solution. Two experiments are conducted under identical temperature and environmental conditions.\n\nIn the first experiment (the control case), a pre-weighed coupon of mild steel is fully immersed in a 1.0 Molar solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) for 24 hours. After this period, the coupon is carefully removed, cleaned of corrosion products, dried, and re-weighed. The total mass loss due to corrosion is determined to be 2.56 grams.\n\nIn the second experiment, an identical mild steel coupon is immersed for the same 24-hour duration in an identical 1.0 Molar HCl solution, which has been modified with a small concentration of the new plant-derived inhibitor. After the exposure, the coupon undergoes the same cleaning, drying, and weighing procedure.

An inhibitor is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends on specific chemical interactions with both the metal surface and the surrounding environment. This problem [@problem_id:1546541] challenges you to think critically about material-specific chemistry, exploring why a successful inhibitor for steel might not only fail but actually accelerate the corrosion of aluminum by considering the properties of their respective passive films.", "problem": "A manufacturing facility uses an aqueous solution of sodium phosphate ($\\text{Na}_3\\text{PO}_4$) as an effective corrosion inhibitor for its carbon steel components. The mechanism involves the formation of a stable, non-conductive passivation layer of iron(III) phosphate on the steel surface, which acts as a physical barrier to the corrosive environment. An engineer, noting the success of this inhibitor, proposes using the same aqueous solution to protect a new line of components made from pure aluminum.\n\nFrom an electrochemical and chemical properties standpoint, which of the following statements provides the primary reason why this proposal is flawed and may even accelerate the corrosion of the aluminum parts?\n\nA. Aluminum phosphate ($\\text{AlPO}_4$) is significantly more soluble in neutral water than iron(III) phosphate ($\\text{FePO}_4$), which prevents the formation of a stable protective film.\n\nB. The standard reduction potential of $\\text{Al}^{3+}/\\text{Al}$ is much more negative than that of $\\text{Fe}^{3+}/\\text{Fe}$, which causes the phosphate ions to be directly reduced by the aluminum metal, thus consuming the inhibitor.\n\nC. Aluminum naturally forms a passive layer of aluminum oxide ($\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$), which is amphoteric. An aqueous solution of sodium phosphate is alkaline, which will chemically dissolve this protective oxide layer and expose the active aluminum metal underneath.\n\nD. The ionic radius of the phosphate ion is too large to create a dense, passivating film on the surface of aluminum, which has a smaller atomic radius than iron.\n\nE. The formation of the aluminum phosphate layer requires a high activation energy, making the passivation process kinetically unfeasible under typical operating conditions compared to the rapid formation of iron phosphate.", "solution": "We analyze the inhibitor’s action on steel and why extending it to aluminum is flawed by invoking electrochemical passivation, oxide chemistry, and acid-base behavior.\n\n1) On carbon steel, phosphate inhibits corrosion by forming a sparingly soluble iron(III) phosphate film:\n$$Fe^{3+}\\text{(aq)} + PO_{4}^{3-}\\text{(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{FePO}_{4}\\text{(s)}.$$\nThis adherent, non-conductive $\\text{FePO}_{4}\\text{(s)}$ layer passivates the surface and reduces further anodic dissolution of iron.\n\n2) Aluminum, however, already self-passivates in neutral environments by forming a thin, adherent film of aluminum oxide:\n$$Al\\text{(s)} + \\text{oxygen/water} \\to \\text{Al}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}\\text{(s)} \\text{ on the surface.}$$\nCrucially, $\\text{Al}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$ is amphoteric, meaning it dissolves in both acids and bases.

The dominant factor is alkaline dissolution of $\\text{Al}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$, not $\\text{AlPO}_{4}$ solubility in neutral water.\n- B is incorrect: While $\\text{Al}^{3+}/\\text{Al}$ has a much more negative standard potential than $\\text{Fe}^{3+}/\\text{Fe}$, phosphate is not an oxidizing agent and is not “reduced” by aluminum; the inhibitor is not consumed via phosphate reduction.\n- D is incorrect: Passivation depends on the chemistry and stability of surface compounds, not a simple size mismatch between $\\text{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ and metal atomic radii.\n- E is not the primary reason: Even if kinetics were considered, the key practical effect is the chemical dissolution of the existing protective $\\text{Al}_{2}\\text{O}_{3}$ in alkaline phosphate, not a kinetic barrier to forming $\\text{AlPO}_{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason the proposal is flawed, and may even accelerate corrosion, is that the alkaline phosphate solution dissolves aluminum’s protective oxide due to its amphoteric nature.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1546541"}, {"introduction": "In real-world applications like pipelines, corrosion occurs under fluid flow, where the rate of inhibition can be limited by how fast the inhibitor reaches the surface (diffusion) or by how fast it adsorbs onto it (kinetics).
