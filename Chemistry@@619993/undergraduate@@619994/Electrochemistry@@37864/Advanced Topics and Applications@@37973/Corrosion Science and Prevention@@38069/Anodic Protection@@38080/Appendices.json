To assess its corrosion behavior, the team characterizes the anodic polarization of Alloy X in the acid. All potentials are measured with respect to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). The key features of the polarization behavior are determined as follows:\n\n- The alloy exhibits an open-circuit corrosion potential ($E_{corr}$) of -0.55 V. At this potential, the corrosion current density ($i_{corr}$) is $5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ A/cm$^2$.\n- To induce passivation, the potential must be increased. This process requires passing through a peak active-state current density, known as the critical anodic current density ($i_{crit}$), which is measured to be $1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ A/cm$^2$.\n- The potential corresponding to this peak current density is the primary passivation potential ($E_{pp}$), found to be -0.20 V.\n- For potentials more positive than $E_{pp}$, the alloy enters a passive state where the current density drops to a stable, low value. This passive current density ($i_p$) is observed to be $3.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ A/cm$^2$.\n- This state of low corrosion is maintained until the potential reaches the transpassive potential ($E_t$) of +0.85 V, above which the current density begins to increase sharply again, indicating breakdown of the passive film.\n\nFor anodic protection of this alloy to be considered technically and economically viable, three engineering criteria must be satisfied:\n- **Criterion 1 (Corrosion Tolerance):** The passive current density, $i_p$, must not exceed $5.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ A/cm$^2$.\n- **Criterion 2 (Control Stability):** The width of the passive potential range, defined as the difference between the transpassive and primary passivation potentials ($E_t - E_{pp}$), must be at least 1.00 V to ensure stable potentiostatic control.\n- **Criterion 3 (Power Requirement):** The critical anodic current density, $i_{crit}$, must not exceed $1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ A/cm$^2$ to be within the capacity of standard industrial potentiostats.\n\nBased on the provided data and the engineering criteria, which of the following statements correctly assesses the suitability of Alloy X for anodic protection in this sulfuric acid environment?\n\nA.
