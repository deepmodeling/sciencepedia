For species indexed by $j$ in the set of electroactive species, this can be written as\n$$\ni(V)=\\sum_{j} k_{j} C_{j}(V)+i_{\\text{res}},\n$$\nwhere $k_{j}$ is a constant determined by the electrochemical and mass-transport parameters for species $j$ under the fixed experimental conditions, and $C_{j}(V)$ is its bulk concentration as a function of the added titrant volume $V$.\n\nBefore any titrant is added, only the analyte $X$ (and supporting electrolyte) is present. The initial current is\n$$\ni_{0}=k_{X} C_{X}^{0}+i_{\\text{res}}.\n$$\nThe observation that $i_{0}$ is significant and stable above the residual implies $k_{X} C_{X}^{0}>0$, hence the analyte is electroactive.\n\nLet the stoichiometric reaction be $X+\\nu T\\to P$, proceeding to completion. Before the equivalence point, all added titrant $T$ is consumed, so $C_{T}(V)\\approx 0$, $C_{X}(V)$ decreases from its initial value by the stoichiometric consumption, and $C_{P}(V)$ increases accordingly. The observed linear decrease of the current with added titrant up to equivalence is described by\n$$\ni(V)=k_{X} C_{X}(V)+i_{\\text{res}},\n$$\nwith no additional terms from $T$ or $P$. A linear decrease to the equivalence point is consistent with only the analyte contributing to the current while its concentration is reduced by reaction; any contribution from $T$ or $P$ would alter this simple linear behavior unless it were negligible.\n\nAfter the equivalence point, $C_{X}=0$ and no further product forms, while the concentration of $T$ increases with added volume. The observation that the current remains at a very low, near-zero residual value implies that neither the excess titrant nor the product contributes to the current. If the titrant were electroactive, the post-equivalence current would increase linearly with $C_{T}(V)$, rather than remaining constant. If the product were electroactive, the current at and after equivalence would plateau at a nonzero value $k_{P} C_{P} + i_{\\text{res}}$, contrary to the near-zero residual observation.\n\nTherefore, the analyte is electroactive, while the titrant and the product are not.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1537666"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's consider the inverse situation, where the titrant is electroactive but the analyte is inert, leading to a different but equally informative titration curve.
