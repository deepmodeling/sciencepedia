The procedure involves a deposition step where a potential of -1.20 V versus a standard reference electrode is applied for 120 seconds. During this time, both metal ions are reduced and concentrated as amalgams in the mercury drop. This is followed by a stripping step where the potential is scanned linearly towards more positive values, causing the metals to be re-oxidized and producing a current that is proportional to their concentration.\n\nThe analysis of the wastewater sample yields a voltammogram with a sharp, well-defined peak for copper stripping near -0.2 V.

For a metal ion $\\text{M}^{z+}$ forming an amalgam $\\text{M(Hg)}$, the equilibrium potential for the reduction half-reaction $\\text{M}^{z+} + z e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{M(Hg)}$ is governed by the Nernst equation\n$$\nE = E^{0}_{M^{z+}/M(\\text{Hg})} + \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{a_{\\text{M}^{z+}}}{a_{\\text{M(Hg)}}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $a_{\\text{M}^{z+}}$ is the activity of the solvated ion and $a_{\\text{M(Hg)}}$ is the activity of the metal in the amalgam phase.

Copper and zinc exhibit strong mutual interactions and can form mixed phases (solid solutions or intermetallic-like domains) within the amalgam. This has two key consequences for the zinc stripping response:\n\n1) Thermodynamic effect on potential: Formation of a Cu–Zn mixed phase stabilizes zinc in the amalgam and lowers its effective activity $a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}$ relative to a pure $\\text{Zn}$–Hg amalgam. From the Nernst relation above, decreasing $a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}$ increases $\\ln\\!\\big(a_{\\text{Zn}^{2+}}/a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}\\big)$ and therefore shifts $E_{\\text{Zn}}$ to more positive values. Moreover, because the local composition of the ternary Hg–Cu–Zn amalgam is heterogeneous, $a_{\\text{Zn}(\\text{Hg})}$ is distributed over a range of values, so the oxidation of zinc occurs over a spread of potentials, broadening the peak.\n\n2) Kinetic and dealloying effects: Oxidation of zinc embedded in a Cu-rich environment requires dealloying and may proceed via multiple steps with slower charge-transfer and solid-state diffusion, which reduces the peak current and broadens the response. A fraction of zinc can be retained in more stable Cu–Zn domains during the scan window, further suppressing the apparent zinc signal.\n\nThese behaviors—suppressed magnitude, broadening, and a shift to more positive potential—are hallmarks of alloy or intermetallic formation affecting the activity and stripping kinetics of the less noble metal (zinc) in the presence of the more noble metal (copper). The copper peak remains sharp because copper is less affected by zinc at its oxidation potential and because its own activity in the amalgam is not similarly suppressed at the relevant potential range.\n\nThe alternative options are less consistent with the observations:\n- A would mostly reduce the amount of zinc available to strip but would not inherently cause a broadened peak and systematic positive shift; furthermore, pre-scan re-oxidation catalyzed by dissolved copper is not expected under these deposition conditions.\n- B posits a physical barrier on mercury, but both metals form amalgams rather than a blocking film; deposition is simultaneous, and such a barrier mechanism is not consistent with HMDE behavior.\n- C (hydrogen evolution) would affect both the sample and the zinc-only control under the same potential and medium; it would not selectively distort zinc only in the presence of copper while leaving the copper peak sharp.\n- E would also suppress zinc in the control if the same supporting electrolyte were used; the control shows a sharp zinc peak, contradicting this explanation.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible explanation is the formation of a stable Cu–Zn mixed phase within the mercury drop that stabilizes zinc and complicates its oxidation, yielding a suppressed, broadened, and positively shifted zinc stripping peak.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1538463"}]}
