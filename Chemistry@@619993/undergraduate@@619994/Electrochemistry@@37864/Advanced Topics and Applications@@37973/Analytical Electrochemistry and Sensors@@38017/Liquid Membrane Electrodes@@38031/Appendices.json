The factor of 2.303 arises from the conversion of the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) to the base-10 logarithm ($\\log$).\n\nFirst, we must calculate the theoretical slope for a fluoride-selective electrode at the given temperature.\nThe ion is fluoride, F⁻, so its charge number is $z = -1$.\nThe temperature is given as $T = 25.00 \\, ^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. We must convert this to Kelvin:\n$$T(\\text{K}) = 25.00 + 273.15 = 298.15 \\, \\text{K}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation for the theoretical slope:\n$$S_{\\text{theoretical}} = \\frac{2.303 \\times (8.314 \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1}) \\times (298.15 \\, \\text{K})}{(-1) \\times (96485 \\, \\text{C}\\cdot\\text{mol}^{-1})}$$\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n$$S_{\\text{theoretical}} = \\frac{5706.3}{ -96485} \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{C}}$$\nSince 1 Joule per Coulomb is 1 Volt (1 J/C = 1 V), the unit is Volts.\n$$S_{\\text{theoretical}} = -0.05914 \\, \\text{V/decade}$$\n\nThe problem gives the experimental slope in millivolts (mV), so we convert our theoretical value to mV:\n$$S_{\\text{theoretical}} = -0.05914 \\, \\text{V/decade} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{mV}}{1 \\, \\text{V}} = -59.14 \\, \\text{mV/decade}$$\n\nNow we compare the experimental slope, $S_{\\text{exp}} = -58.0 \\, \\text{mV/decade}$, with the theoretical ideal slope, $S_{\\text{theoretical}} = -59.14 \\, \\text{mV/decade}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the experimental slope, $|-58.0| = 58.0$, is slightly less than the magnitude of the theoretical slope, $|-59.14| = 59.14$. In practice, real-world electrodes rarely achieve the perfect theoretical response. A response slope whose magnitude is less than the ideal Nernstian slope is termed a \"sub-Nernstian\" response. This indicates that the electrode is functioning well, but with a sensitivity slightly lower than the ideal maximum. A slope of 95-99% of the theoretical value is often considered good. In this case, the efficiency is $\\frac{58.0}{59.14} \\approx 0.981$, or 98.1%, which is excellent performance.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The electrode is exhibiting a perfect, ideal Nernstian response. This is incorrect. An ideal response would have a slope of -59.14 mV/decade, not -58.0 mV/decade.\nB. The electrode is primarily responding to a divalent anion, such as sulfate (SO₄²⁻). If the electrode were responding to a divalent anion, $z$ would be -2. The theoretical slope would be $S = -59.14 / 2 = -29.57$ mV/decade. The experimental value of -58.0 mV/decade is far from this, so this option is incorrect.\nC. The electrode is exhibiting a sub-Nernstian response, indicating good but non-ideal performance. This is the correct conclusion. The slope's magnitude is close to, but slightly less than, the ideal value.\nD. The electrode is exhibiting a super-Nernstian response. This would mean the magnitude of the slope is greater than the theoretical value (e.g., -60.0 mV/decade). This is not the case.\nE. The electrode is non-functional. A non-functional or non-responsive electrode would have a slope close to 0 mV/decade. A slope of -58.0 mV/decade indicates a very strong and selective response to the fluoride ion. This option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the electrode shows a sub-Nernstian response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1570183"}, {"introduction": "A primary challenge in using ion-selective electrodes is the presence of interfering ions in the sample matrix.
