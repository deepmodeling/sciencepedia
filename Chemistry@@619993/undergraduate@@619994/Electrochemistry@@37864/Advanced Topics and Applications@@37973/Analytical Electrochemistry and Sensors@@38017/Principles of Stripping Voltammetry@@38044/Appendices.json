The ASV experiment consists of two main steps. First, a deposition step is performed at a sufficiently negative potential to reduce the cadmium ions in the solution to cadmium metal, which then accumulates by forming an amalgam with a hanging mercury drop electrode. Second, a stripping step is performed where the potential is scanned in the positive direction, causing the accumulated cadmium metal to be oxidized back into Cd$^{2+}$, which generates a measurable current. The peak value of this current is the analytical signal.\n\nIn an initial measurement, the chemist applies a deposition potential for a duration of $t_{d,1} = 120$ seconds and observes a peak stripping current of $i_{p,1} = 0.46$ µA. To improve the sensitivity of the measurement for a subsequent analysis of the same sample, the chemist increases the deposition time to $t_{d,2} = 360$ seconds, while keeping all other experimental parameters constant (including electrode size, stirring rate, and the potential scan rate during the stripping step).\n\nAssuming that the amount of metal deposited is directly proportional to the deposition time and that the peak stripping current is directly proportional to the amount of metal accumulated in the amalgam, calculate the new peak stripping current, $i_{p,2}$.

The ASV process consists of two key stages. First, in the deposition stage, a sufficiently negative potential is applied to the electrode for a fixed period to reduce metal ions from the solution and preconcentrate them into the mercury, forming an amalgam. Second, in the stripping stage, the potential is scanned linearly toward more positive values, causing the dissolved metals to be oxidized and \"stripped\" back into the solution, which generates a current peak for each metal. The height of this peak is ideally proportional to the metal's concentration.\n\nThe chemist first runs a calibration standard containing only a known concentration of $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ and observes a sharp, well-defined current peak at the expected stripping potential. However, when analyzing the wastewater sample, the chemist observes that the peak corresponding to zinc is significantly smaller and broader than anticipated for the expected concentration range.

The stripping peak for copper appears normal.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible electrochemical explanation for the observed suppression and broadening of the zinc stripping peak in the presence of copper?\n\nA.

During the deposition step, the reduced zinc and copper atoms form a stable intermetallic compound within the mercury amalgam, which is thermodynamically more difficult to oxidize than pure zinc amalgam.\n\nC. Copper ions have a much more positive reduction potential than zinc ions, which causes copper to completely cover the mercury surface first, physically blocking the subsequent deposition of zinc ions.\n\nD.

If a distribution of Cu–Zn compositions is present, then $a_{\\text{Zn}}$ spans a range of values, producing a distribution of stripping potentials. This spreads the zinc oxidation over a broader potential interval, manifesting as a broadened and suppressed peak (the same total charge is distributed over a wider potential window, lowering the peak height).\n\nBy contrast:\n- Option A proposes immediate catalytic re-reduction of $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ during stripping by copper ions. Under a controlled potential scan, the electrode dictates the direction of electron transfer; spontaneous re-reduction of $\\text{Zn}^{2+}$ by $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$ at the electrode is not a credible pathway for selective suppression and broadening of the zinc peak.\n- Option C asserts complete surface blocking by copper. At a mercury drop, deposition involves dissolution into the mercury phase; total blocking is unlikely, and simple site blocking would mainly reduce the amount of deposited zinc without necessarily causing pronounced broadening. Moreover, the observed broadening and selective suppression are more consistent with altered thermodynamics than mere geometric blocking.\n- Option D suggests an uncompensated resistance effect. A large $iR$ drop would distort the entire voltammogram, typically affecting all peaks similarly; the copper peak appears normal, contradicting this explanation.\n- Option E asserts zinc complexation independent of copper; this does not explain why the zinc peak degrades specifically in the presence of copper while copper’s peak remains normal.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible electrochemical explanation is that co-deposition produces Cu–Zn intermetallic-like environments that lower $a_{\\text{Zn}}$ and create a distribution of stripping potentials, causing the zinc peak to be suppressed and broadened.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1582104"}]}
