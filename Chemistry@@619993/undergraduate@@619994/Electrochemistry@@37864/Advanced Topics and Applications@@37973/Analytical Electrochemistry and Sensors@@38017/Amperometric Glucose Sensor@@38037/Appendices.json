Both sensors operate by immobilizing the enzyme Glucose Oxidase (GOx) on an electrode surface. The enzymatic reaction of glucose with oxygen produces hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which is then electrochemically oxidized at the electrode to generate a current proportional to the reaction rate. The two sensors are identical in every way except for the surface concentration of active GOx. Sensor A has a GOx surface concentration of $\\Gamma_A$, while Sensor B has a concentration of $\\Gamma_B = 5 \\Gamma_A$.\n\nThe performance of such sensors can be modeled by considering both the mass transfer of glucose from the bulk solution to the enzyme layer and the enzyme kinetics within the layer.

The rate $R$ is given by the Michaelis-Menten expression $R = \\frac{V'_{max} [G]_{surface}}{K_M + [G]_{surface}}$.

The measured current is directly proportional to $R$.\n\nTwo key performance metrics are the sensitivity and the linear dynamic range.\n1.
