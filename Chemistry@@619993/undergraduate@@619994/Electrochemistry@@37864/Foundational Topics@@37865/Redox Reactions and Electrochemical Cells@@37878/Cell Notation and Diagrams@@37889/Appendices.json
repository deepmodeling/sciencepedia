This first exercise challenges you to act as a proofreader, scrutinizing a proposed notation for a common reference electrode, an electrode of the second kind. Correctly identifying the error here will solidify your understanding that the notation must precisely reflect the physical sequence of phases and interfaces within the electrode system [@problem_id:1541843].", "problem": "An electrochemistry student is constructing a galvanic cell and proposes the following cell notation to represent it. The cell is composed of a silver-silver chloride electrode and a Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), which is an electrode that involves the conversion between hydrogen ions and hydrogen gas.\n\nThe proposed cell notation is:\n$Ag(s) | Cl^{-}(aq) | AgCl(s) || H^{+}(aq) | H_{2}(g) | Pt(s)$\n\nWhich of the following statements identifies the fundamental error in the student's application of cell notation conventions?\n\nA. The order of species in the anode compartment is incorrect. The notation for an electrode of the second kind must reflect the physical layering of the components.\n\nB. The use of a double vertical line `||` is incorrect; a single vertical line `|` should be used to represent the salt bridge.\n\nC. The silver-silver chloride electrode must be the cathode. Cell notation always places the electrode with the higher standard reduction potential on the right.\n\nD. The physical states of the species are missing. For example, $Cl^{-}$ should be written as $Cl^{-}(aq)$.\n\nE. An inert electrode like Platinum ($Pt$) is not required for the Standard Hydrogen Electrode half-cell.", "solution": "Cell notation conventions require the following: a single vertical line $|$ denotes a phase boundary; a double vertical line $||$ denotes a liquid junction or salt bridge; species are written in the order they are physically contacted from the electrode surface out to the solution on each side; and, by common convention in galvanic cells, the anode half-cell is written on the left and the cathode half-cell on the right, although the latter is not a strict rule of notation (reversing the order reverses the sign of the cell potential but is still valid notation).\n\nEvaluate each option against these conventions.\n\nFirst, assess the left half-cell, which is a silver-silver chloride electrode (an electrode of the second kind). Physically, the metal silver is covered by solid silver chloride, which is in equilibrium with chloride ions in solution. Therefore, the correct order must reflect the layering $Ag(s)$ in contact with $AgCl(s)$, which in turn contacts $Cl^{-}(aq)$. Hence the proper notation of this half-cell is $Ag(s) | AgCl(s) | Cl^{-}(aq)$. The student wrote $Ag(s) | Cl^{-}(aq) | AgCl(s)$, which places the aqueous chloride between the metal and its sparingly soluble salt and does not reflect the actual phase boundaries. This violates the rule that the order in the notation follows the physical sequence of phases and interfaces. Thus the fundamental error lies in the ordering in the anode compartment, as stated in option A.\n\nNext, evaluate the salt bridge notation. The double vertical line $||$ is the correct symbol for the liquid junction or salt bridge; a single vertical line $|$ would incorrectly denote a phase boundary within a half-cell. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nRegarding option C, while in a spontaneous cell under standard conditions $AgCl(s) + e^{-} \\rightarrow Ag(s) + Cl^{-}(aq)$ has a positive standard potential relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode, cell notation does not require that the higher standard reduction potential be placed on the right; the left-right placement is a convention that can be reversed, changing the sign of the reported cell potential. Therefore, stating that the silver-silver chloride electrode must be on the right as the cathode because notation “always” places the higher potential on the right is incorrect as a rule of notation. Thus, option C is not the fundamental error.\n\nFor option D, the student has included physical states: $Ag(s)$, $Cl^{-}(aq)$, $AgCl(s)$, $H^{+}(aq)$, $H_{2}(g)$, and $Pt(s)$, so the claim that states are missing is false.\n\nFinally, for option E, an inert electrode is required for the Standard Hydrogen Electrode, since neither $H^{+}(aq)$ nor $H_{2}(g)$ can serve as a conducting solid. The correct SHE notation is $Pt(s) | H_{2}(g) | H^{+}(aq)$ or, when written from the salt bridge toward the electrode on the right side of a full cell, $H^{+}(aq) | H_{2}(g) | Pt(s)$. Therefore, stating that platinum is not required is incorrect.\n\nThe only statement that correctly identifies the fundamental error in the student’s notation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1541843"}, {"introduction": "Once you've mastered the structure of cell notation, the next step is to interpret what it tells us about the cell's behavior.
