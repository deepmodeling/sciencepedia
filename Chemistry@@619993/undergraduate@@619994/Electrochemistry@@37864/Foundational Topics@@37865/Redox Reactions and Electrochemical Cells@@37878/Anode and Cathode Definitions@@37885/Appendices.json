Electrode A is immersed in a 0.010 M aqueous solution of silver nitrate ($AgNO_3$), which constitutes half-cell A. Electrode B is immersed in a 1.0 M aqueous solution of the same salt, constituting half-cell B. The two half-cells are maintained at a constant temperature $T$ and are connected by a salt bridge containing a saturated solution of potassium nitrate ($KNO_3$). The two silver electrodes are connected by an external wire, allowing the cell to operate spontaneously. Given this setup, which one of the following statements provides a completely correct description of the processes occurring as the cell generates an electric current?\n\nA. Electrode A is the anode, and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$) from the salt bridge will migrate towards half-cell A.\n\nB. Electrode B is the anode, and electrons flow from electrode B to electrode A through the external wire.\n\nC. Electrode A is the cathode, and potassium ions ($K^+$) from the salt bridge will migrate towards half-cell A.\n\nD. Electrode B is the cathode, and the concentration of $Ag^+$ in half-cell B will increase over time.\n\nE.

At the anode A, oxidation produces $Ag^{+}$, creating excess positive charge; therefore, anions from the bridge migrate into half-cell A. With a $KNO_{3}$ bridge, $NO_{3}^{-}$ migrates toward A. At the cathode B, reduction consumes $Ag^{+}$, leaving an excess of anions; therefore, cations $K^{+}$ migrate toward B.\n\nAmong the options, the fully correct statement is that electrode A is the anode and $NO_{3}^{-}$ migrates toward half-cell A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1538181"}, {"introduction": "The definitions of anode and cathode are universal, but their polarities can change depending on the type of electrochemical cell.
