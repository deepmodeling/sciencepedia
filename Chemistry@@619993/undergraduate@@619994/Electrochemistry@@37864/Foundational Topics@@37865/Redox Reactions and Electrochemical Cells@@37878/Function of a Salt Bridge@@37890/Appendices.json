Mastering this concept is the first step to understanding how a galvanic cell operates as a complete circuit [@problem_id:1562578].", "problem": "An electrochemical cell is constructed using two half-cells at standard conditions. The first half-cell consists of a solid zinc electrode immersed in a solution containing zinc ions ($Zn^{2+}$). The second half-cell consists of a solid silver electrode immersed in a solution containing silver ions ($Ag^{+}$). The two half-cells are connected by a salt bridge filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of potassium nitrate ($KNO_3$). An external wire connects the two electrodes, allowing the cell to operate spontaneously.\n\nThe standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions are:\n$Zn^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \\rightarrow Zn(s)$, $E^\\circ = -0.76$ V\n$Ag^{+}(aq) + e^- \\rightarrow Ag(s)$, $E^\\circ = +0.80$ V\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the net direction of movement for the potassium ions ($K^+$) and nitrate ions ($NO_3^-$) within the salt bridge while the cell is discharging?\n\nA.

Specifically:\n- In the zinc half-cell (anode), oxidation produces $Zn^{2+}$, increasing positive charge in solution; to counterbalance, anions from the salt bridge must enter this half-cell. Thus $NO_{3}^{-}$ migrates toward the zinc half-cell.\n- In the silver half-cell (cathode), $Ag^{+}$ is consumed by reduction, decreasing the concentration of cations and leaving an excess of negative charge; to counterbalance, cations from the salt bridge must enter this half-cell. Thus $K^{+}$ migrates toward the silver half-cell.\n\nTherefore, potassium ions move toward the silver half-cell and nitrate ions move toward the zinc half-cell, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1562578"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals of ion migration, this next exercise explores a critical, practical aspect of cell design: the chemical nature of the salt bridge electrolyte [@problem_id:1562607]. An effective salt bridge must be composed of an *inert* salt. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario where this rule is violated, forcing you to predict the consequences of using a reactive electrolyte. Successfully analyzing this situation will highlight why chemical compatibility is just as vital as ionic conductivity for sustained cell operation.", "problem": "An electrochemical cell is constructed at 298 K. One half-cell consists of a zinc electrode immersed in a 1.0 M solution of zinc nitrate, Zn(NO₃)₂.

The cell will operate normally with an initial voltage of 1.10 V, as the salt bridge ions are inert with respect to the electrode materials.\n\nB. The cell potential will rapidly drop to zero because the formation of a precipitate prevents the maintenance of charge neutrality in one of the half-cells.\n\nC. The cell will operate, but its initial voltage will be significantly lower than 1.10 V because the precipitation reaction consumes ions that would otherwise contribute to conductivity.\n\nD. The roles of anode and cathode will be reversed from what is predicted by the standard potentials, with copper being oxidized and zinc being reduced.\n\nE. A layer of barium metal will be deposited onto the copper electrode because the Ba²⁺ ions will be preferentially reduced over the Cu²⁺ ions.\n\nF. The cell voltage will slowly increase over time as the precipitation of BaSO₄ removes sulfate ions, shifting the cathode reaction equilibrium according to Le Châtelier's principle.", "solution": "Step 1: Determine the anode and cathode of the galvanic cell.\nThe half-reaction with the more positive (or less negative) standard reduction potential will be the reduction half-reaction, occurring at the cathode.

Anions from the salt bridge flow into the anode compartment to balance the positive charge created by oxidation, and cations from the salt bridge flow into the cathode compartment to balance the negative charge left behind by reduction.\nThe salt bridge contains barium nitrate, Ba(NO₃)₂, which dissociates into $Ba^{2+}$ cations and $NO_3^{-}$ anions.\n\n- Anode Compartment (Zn in Zn(NO₃)₂): Zn is oxidized to $Zn^{2+}$, increasing the concentration of positive ions. To maintain neutrality, anions from the salt bridge, $NO_3^{-}$, must flow into this compartment. Zinc nitrate is soluble, so no reaction occurs.\n- Cathode Compartment (Cu in CuSO₄): $Cu^{2+}$ is reduced to Cu(s), removing positive ions from the solution. This leaves an excess of sulfate anions ($SO_4^{2-}$). To maintain neutrality, cations from the salt bridge, $Ba^{2+}$, must flow into this compartment.\n\nStep 4: Identify and analyze the consequence of the chemical reaction in the cathode compartment.\nAs $Ba^{2+}$ ions from the salt bridge enter the cathode compartment, they encounter the $SO_4^{2-}$ ions from the copper sulfate electrolyte. The problem states that barium sulfate (BaSO₄) is a nearly insoluble salt. Therefore, a precipitation reaction will occur:\n$$ Ba^{2+}(aq) + SO_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow BaSO_4(s) $$\n\nStep 5: Determine the effect of this precipitation on cell function.\nThe purpose of the $Ba^{2+}$ ions flowing into the cathode compartment is to replenish the positive charge lost by the reduction of $Cu^{2+}$. However, because the $Ba^{2+}$ ions are immediately removed from the solution as a solid precipitate, they fail to achieve this. The reduction of $Cu^{2+}$ continues for a very short time, leading to a build-up of uncompensated negative charge (excess $SO_4^{2-}$ ions). This accumulation of negative charge in the cathode compartment creates an electrostatic potential that opposes the flow of electrons to the cathode. As a result, the flow of current stops, and the cell potential rapidly drops to zero. The cell ceases to operate.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\nA. Incorrect. The cell will not operate normally because the precipitation reaction prevents the salt bridge from functioning correctly.\nB. Correct. The formation of $BaSO_4$ precipitate prevents the $Ba^{2+}$ ions from balancing the charge in the cathode compartment. This \"blocks\" the circuit by stopping ion migration, leading to a rapid drop in potential to zero.\nC. Incorrect. The effect is not merely a reduction in voltage; it's a complete and rapid cessation of cell function. The potential doesn't just get lower, it drops to zero.\nD. Incorrect. The inherent chemical properties (standard potentials) dictate the roles of anode and cathode. The side reaction in the salt bridge does not reverse these fundamental roles.\nE. Incorrect. The standard reduction potential of $Ba^{2+}$ to Ba is extremely negative (approx. -2.91 V), making it much harder to reduce than $Cu^{2+}$ ($+0.34$ V). $Cu^{2+}$ will be reduced exclusively.\nF. Incorrect. The cell potential will not increase; it will plummet. While removing sulfate could theoretically shift the equilibrium, the primary effect is the failure of the salt bridge to maintain charge neutrality, which is catastrophic for cell operation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1562607"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding, our final practice connects the macroscopic electrical current measured in the external circuit to the microscopic flow of ions within the salt bridge.
