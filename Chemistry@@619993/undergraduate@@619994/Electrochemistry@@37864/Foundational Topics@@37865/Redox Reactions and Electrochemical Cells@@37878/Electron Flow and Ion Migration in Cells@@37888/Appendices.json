Based on this, you will deduce the direction of electron flow in the external wire and the crucial corresponding migration of ions from the salt bridge that keeps the system in balance.", "problem": "A galvanic cell is constructed under standard conditions. One half-cell consists of a solid nickel (Ni) electrode immersed in a solution of $1.0 \\, \\text{M}$ nickel(II) nitrate, $Ni(NO_3)_2$. The other half-cell consists of a solid silver (Ag) electrode in a solution of $1.0 \\, \\text{M}$ silver nitrate, $AgNO_3$. The two half-cells are connected by a salt bridge containing a concentrated solution of potassium nitrate, $KNO_3$. The standard reduction potentials for the relevant half-reactions are:\n\n$Ag^{+}(aq) + e^{-} \\rightarrow Ag(s) \\quad E^{\\circ} = +0.80 \\, \\text{V}$\n$Ni^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Ni(s) \\quad E^{\\circ} = -0.25 \\, \\text{V}$\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the movement of particles when the cell is operating?\n\nA.

Potassium ions ($K^{+}$) migrate into the nickel half-cell, and nitrate ions ($NO_3^{-}$) migrate into the silver half-cell.\n\nC. Silver ions ($Ag^{+}$) migrate from the silver half-cell, through the salt bridge, and into the nickel half-cell.\n\nD. Nitrate ions ($NO_3^{-}$) from the salt bridge migrate into the nickel half-cell, and potassium ions ($K^{+}$) from the salt bridge migrate into the silver half-cell.\n\nE. Electrons flow through the external wire from the silver electrode to the nickel electrode.", "solution": "The relevant standard reduction half-reactions and potentials are:\n$$Ag^{+}(aq) + e^{-} \\rightarrow Ag(s), \\quad E^{\\circ} = +0.80 \\text{ V}$$\n$$Ni^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow Ni(s), \\quad E^{\\circ} = -0.25 \\text{ V}$$\nBy the principle that in a galvanic cell the half-reaction with the higher standard reduction potential occurs as a reduction at the cathode, silver is reduced at the silver electrode (cathode), and nickel must be oxidized at the nickel electrode (anode). The oxidation half-reaction at the anode is:\n$$Ni(s) \\rightarrow Ni^{2+}(aq) + 2e^{-}$$\n\nElectrons flow through the external circuit from anode to cathode; therefore, electrons flow from the nickel electrode to the silver electrode. This makes any statement asserting electron flow from silver to nickel, or electron flow through the salt bridge, incorrect, because the salt bridge carries ions, not electrons.\n\nCharge balance in the solutions is maintained by ion migration through the salt bridge. The general rule is that anions migrate into the anode compartment (where cations are produced) and cations migrate into the cathode compartment (where cations are consumed). In this cell, $Ni^{2+}$ accumulates in the anode compartment, so anions from the salt bridge, $NO_{3}^{-}$, migrate into the nickel half-cell. At the cathode, $Ag^{+}$ is consumed, so cations from the salt bridge, $K^{+}$, migrate into the silver half-cell.\n\nTherefore:\n- Electrons do not migrate through the salt bridge (reject A).\n- $K^{+}$ does not migrate into the nickel half-cell and $NO_{3}^{-}$ does not migrate into the silver half-cell (reject B).\n- $Ag^{+}$ does not migrate through the salt bridge into the nickel half-cell (reject C).\n- Electrons do not flow from silver to nickel through the external wire (reject E).\n- $NO_{3}^{-}$ migrates into the nickel half-cell and $K^{+}$ migrates into the silver half-cell (accept D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1558543"}, {"introduction": "Once we know the direction of ion flow, the next critical skill is to quantify the amount of migration. This practice [@problem_id:1558542] links the stoichiometry of the half-reactions to the principle of electroneutrality. By calculating the moles of ions that must migrate to balance the charge generated by a specific amount of electrode deposition, you will solidify your quantitative understanding of how the two half-cells are coupled.", "problem": "Researchers are investigating a simplified model for a novel aqueous battery. The battery is constructed as a galvanic cell with a magnesium metal anode immersed in a 1.0 M magnesium sulfate ($MgSO_4$) solution and an aluminum metal cathode in a 1.0 M aluminum sulfate ($Al_2(SO_4)_3$) solution. A salt bridge containing a concentrated solution of potassium sulfate ($K_2SO_4$) connects the two half-cells, allowing ions to migrate to maintain charge neutrality. The spontaneous overall cell reaction is:\n$$3Mg(s) + 2Al^{3+}(aq) \\rightarrow 3Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2Al(s)$$\nDuring the discharge of this cell, for every one mole of solid aluminum that is deposited onto the cathode, a certain number of moles of sulfate ions ($SO_4^{2-}$) must migrate from the salt bridge into the anode compartment to balance the charge.\n\nCalculate the number of moles of sulfate ions that migrate into the anode compartment.

These $3$ moles of electrons must be supplied by oxidation at the anode, where each mole of $Mg(s)$ produces $2$ moles of electrons. Let $n_{Mg}$ be the moles of $Mg$ oxidized. Charge balance of electrons gives:\n$$2\\,n_{Mg} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_{Mg} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\nThus, $1.5$ moles of $Mg^{2+}$ are produced in the anode compartment:\n$$n_{Mg^{2+}} = 1.5$$\n\nThe creation of $1.5$ moles of $Mg^{2+}$ increases the positive charge in the anode compartment by $+3$ equivalents (since each $Mg^{2+}$ carries charge $+2$). To maintain electroneutrality, anions must migrate from the salt bridge into the anode compartment. Let $n_{SO_{4}^{2-}}$ be the moles of sulfate ions migrating in. Each $SO_{4}^{2-}$ carries charge $-2$, so charge neutrality requires:\n$$2\\,n_{SO_{4}^{2-}} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_{SO_{4}^{2-}} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\n\nTherefore, for every $1$ mole of aluminum deposited, $1.5$ moles of sulfate ions migrate into the anode compartment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.5}$$", "id": "1558542"}, {"introduction": "Electrochemical processes are dynamic, and their rate is measured as current.

An external potentiostat pumps electrons into this compartment at a perfectly constant rate, creating a steady electric current $I$.
