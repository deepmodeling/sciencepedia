Electrical conductivity in a solution is directly related to the concentration, charge, and mobility of the dissolved ions.\n\n**1. Initial State (Before adding titrant)**\nThe initial solution contains barium chloride ($\\text{BaCl}_2$), which is a strong electrolyte. It dissociates completely in water:\n$$\\text{BaCl}_2\\text{(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{Ba}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + 2\\text{Cl}^{-}\\text{(aq)}$$\nThe initial conductivity is due to the presence of mobile $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ and $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions.\n\n**2. During Titration (Before the Equivalence Point)**\nThe titrant is an aqueous solution of sodium sulfate ($\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4$), also a strong electrolyte, which provides $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions. A precipitation reaction occurs between barium ions and sulfate ions:\n$$\\text{Ba}^{2+}\\text{(aq)} + \\text{SO}_4^{2-}\\text{(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{BaSO}_4\\text{(s)}$$\nThe overall reaction in this stage is:\n$$\\text{BaCl}_2\\text{(aq)} + \\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4\\text{(aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{BaSO}_4\\text{(s)} + 2\\text{NaCl}\\text{(aq)}$$\nLet's examine the change in the ionic species. For every mole of $\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4$ added, one mole of $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ions is removed from the solution as it precipitates. The added $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions are also removed via this precipitation. However, two moles of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions are added to the solution and remain dissolved, while the original $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions act as spectator ions.\nEffectively, a single highly charged $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ion is being replaced in the solution by two singly charged $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions.\n\nTo understand the impact on conductivity, we compare the contribution of the ions being replaced with those being added. The molar ionic conductivity ($\\lambda^\\circ$) is a measure of an ion's contribution to the overall conductivity. The relevant values are approximately:\n$\\lambda^\\circ(\\text{Ba}^{2+}) > \\lambda^\\circ(\\text{Na}^{+})$.\nMore specifically, the contribution of an ion to conductivity is proportional to its concentration, charge, and mobility. A $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ion has a charge of +2, while an $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ion has a charge of +1. The molar ionic conductivity of $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ is significantly higher than that of $\\text{Na}^{+}$. So, replacing one $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ion with two $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions results in a net decrease in the solution's overall conductivity. Therefore, from the start of the addition until the equivalence point, the conductivity decreases.\n\n**3. At the Equivalence Point**\nThe equivalence point is reached when just enough $\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4$ has been added to precipitate all the initial $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ions as $\\text{BaSO}_4\\text{(s)}$. At this specific point, the concentration of the highly conductive $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ions is at a minimum. The solution now primarily contains the dissolved salt formed during the reaction, sodium chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$), which consists of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions. Since $\\text{NaCl}$ is a soluble strong electrolyte, the solution still conducts electricity. However, because the high-mobility $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ions have been removed, the overall conductivity reaches a minimum value at this point. This minimum is non-zero due to the presence of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ ions.\n\n**4. After the Equivalence Point**\nOnce all the $\\text{BaCl}_2$ has reacted, any further addition of the $\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4$ solution introduces excess $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions into the solution. No further precipitation occurs. The concentration of mobile ions in the solution begins to increase, with both $\\text{Na}^{+}$ and $\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ contributing to the charge transport. This leads to a steady increase in the overall electrical conductivity of the solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\nCombining these steps, the conductivity of the solution initially decreases as $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ ions are replaced by less conductive $\\text{Na}^{+}$ ions. It reaches a non-zero minimum at the equivalence point when the concentration of $\\text{Ba}^{2+}$ is negligible. After the equivalence point, the conductivity increases as excess electrolyte ($\\text{Na}_2\\text{SO}_4$) is added to the solution. This behavior corresponds to a decrease followed by an increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1558025"}]}
