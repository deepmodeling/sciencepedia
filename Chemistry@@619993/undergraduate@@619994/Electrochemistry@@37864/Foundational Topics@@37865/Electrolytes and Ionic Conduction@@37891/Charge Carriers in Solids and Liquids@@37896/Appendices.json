We can find these by analyzing the two given measurements separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the charge carrier density $p$ using the data from the transverse voltage measurement. This transverse voltage is the Hall voltage, which arises from the balance between the magnetic Lorentz force and the transverse electric force acting on the charge carriers.\nThe magnetic force on a charge carrier with charge $q$ moving at the drift velocity $v_d$ in a magnetic field $B$ is given by $F_B = q v_d B$. For the p-type semiconductor, the charge carriers are holes, so $q = e$.\nThis magnetic force pushes the holes towards one side of the slab, creating a transverse electric field, the Hall field $E_H$. This field exerts an opposing electric force on the holes, $F_E = q E_H = e E_H$.\nIn the steady state, these two forces balance: $F_E = F_B$, which means $e E_H = e v_d B$, or $E_H = v_d B$.\nThe Hall voltage $V_H$ is the potential difference across the width $w$ of the slab due to the Hall field $E_H$. Assuming a uniform field, $V_H = E_H w$.\nSubstituting the expression for $E_H$, we get $V_H = v_d B w$.\n\nNext, we relate the drift velocity $v_d$ to the total current $I$. The current is the total charge passing through a cross-section per unit time. It is given by $I = p q v_d A$, where $p$ is the number density of charge carriers, $q=e$ is their charge, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area through which the current flows. The area is the product of the width and thickness of the slab, $A = w t$. So, $I = p e v_d (w t)$.\nWe can express the drift velocity from this equation as $v_d = \\frac{I}{p e w t}$.\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $v_d$ back into our equation for the Hall voltage:\n$$V_H = \\left(\\frac{I}{p e w t}\\right) B w = \\frac{I B}{p e t}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the hole number density $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{I B}{V_H e t}$$\nWe are given all the values on the right-hand side: $I = 15.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ A, $B = 0.750$ T, $V_H = 3.05 \\times 10^{-3}$ V, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C, and $t = 250.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nPlugging in these values:\n$$p = \\frac{(15.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ A})(0.750 \\text{ T})}{(3.05 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V})(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C})(250.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m})}$$\n$$p = \\frac{1.125 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.221525 \\times 10^{-25}} \\text{ m}^{-3} = 9.20979... \\times 10^{22} \\text{ m}^{-3}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the hole mobility $\\mu_p$.
