This process is driven by pure electrostatic attraction, where ions in a solution are drawn to a surface of opposite charge without forming any chemical bonds. This practice explores a crucial, and often counter-intuitive, aspect of this phenomenon: the role of the ion's hydration shell. By considering how alkali metal cations behave in water, you will develop a strong conceptual foundation for how an ion's size and charge density influence its ability to approach and adsorb onto a surface [@problem_id:1589039].", "problem": "In the design of modern electrochemical systems, such as certain types of batteries or water desalination units, understanding ion behavior near charged surfaces is crucial. Consider a simplified model for a cation-exchange process where a material with a uniformly negative surface charge is submerged in an aqueous solution containing various dissolved salts. The removal of cations from the solution occurs via non-specific adsorption, a process driven primarily by electrostatic forces.\n\nThe solution contains the following alkali metal cations: Lithium ($Li^+$), Sodium ($Na^+$), and Potassium ($K^+$). In water, these ions do not exist as bare ions but are surrounded by a hydration shell of water molecules. The effective size of an ion in solution, its hydrated radius, is determined by the strength of its interaction with these water molecules. For ions of the same charge, a smaller bare ionic radius leads to a higher surface charge density, which in turn causes a stronger electrostatic attraction to polar water molecules. This results in a larger and more tightly bound hydration shell, and thus a larger effective hydrated radius.\n\nThe non-specific adsorption of these hydrated cations is limited by how closely they can approach the negatively charged surface. The distance of closest approach for the center of a hydrated ion to the surface is equal to its hydrated radius.\n\nBased on these principles, which of the following options correctly ranks the cations in order of **increasing** likelihood of non-specific adsorption onto the negatively charged surface?\n\nA. $Li^+  Na^+  K^+$\n\nB. $K^+  Na^+  Li^+$\n\nC. $Na^+  Li^+  K^+$\n\nD. $K^+  Li^+  Na^+$\n\nE.

Let the electrostatic potential of the surface into the solution be $\\phi(x)$, with $x$ the normal distance from the surface.
