Consider two ionic compounds, lithium fluoride (LiF) and cesium iodide (CsI), dissolved in a non-polar solvent such as benzene. We can model an ion pair as two spherical ions in direct contact. The stability of such a pair is determined by its electrostatic potential energy: a more stable pair has a lower (more negative) potential energy. According to a simplified electrostatic model, this energy is inversely proportional to the center-to-center distance between the two ions, which is the sum of their ionic radii.\n\nGiven the following ionic radii:\n- Lithium ion ($\\text{Li}^{+}$): $76$ pm\n- Fluoride ion ($\\text{F}^{-}$): $133$ pm\n- Cesium ion ($\\text{Cs}^{+}$): $167$ pm\n- Iodide ion ($\\text{I}^{-}$): $220$ pm\n\nBased on this model, which of the following statements correctly describes the relative stability of the LiF and CsI ion pairs in the non-polar solvent?\n\nA. The LiF ion pair is more stable than the CsI ion pair.\n\nB. The CsI ion pair is more stable than the LiF ion pair.\n\nC. Both ion pairs have the same stability since the magnitude of the charge on each ion is the same.\n\nD.
