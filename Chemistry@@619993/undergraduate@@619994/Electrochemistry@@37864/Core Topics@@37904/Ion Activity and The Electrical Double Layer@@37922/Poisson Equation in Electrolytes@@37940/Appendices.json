When a non-zero DC voltage is applied, the electrode surface acquires a static charge, causing mobile ions from the electrolyte to redistribute. This creates a region near the electrode-electrolyte interface with a non-uniform ion concentration and thus a non-zero net electric charge density, $\\rho$. The electrostatic potential, $\\phi$, throughout the electrolyte is described by the Poisson equation: $\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the static permittivity of the solution.\n\nThe structure formed by the charged electrode and the adjacent layer of ions is known as the Electric Double Layer (EDL). The characteristic length scale over which the net charge density decays back to zero is the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. For distances from the electrode surface significantly larger than $\\lambda_D$, the electrolyte is considered to be in the \"bulk\" region.\n\nIn computational modeling of such cells, it is often advantageous to simplify the governing equation where possible. In which physical region of the electrolyte is it valid to approximate the Poisson equation by the Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$?\n\nA.

Within the diffuse part of the Electric Double Layer, at distances from the electrode comparable to the Debye length ($x \\approx \\lambda_D$).\n\nE. The approximation is never valid, as the presence of a charged electrode ensures a potential gradient, and therefore a non-zero charge density, everywhere.", "solution": "The central task is to identify the region in the electrolyte where the Poisson equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}$, can be simplified to the Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$.\n\nThis simplification is mathematically valid if and only if the term on the right-hand side of the Poisson equation is equal to zero. Since the permittivity $\\epsilon$ is a non-zero material constant, this condition requires that the net local charge density, $\\rho$, must be approximately zero.\n\nWe must therefore determine in which region of the electrolyte the net charge density is negligible. The problem describes the physical scenario: a charged electrode in an electrolyte solution.\n\n1.  **Near the Electrode Surface:** The electrode is held at a certain potential, meaning it has a surface charge. This charge attracts ions of the opposite sign (counter-ions) and repels ions of the same sign (co-ions) from the electrolyte. This separation of charge leads to the formation of the Electric Double Layer (EDL) adjacent to the electrode. Within the EDL, there is an imbalance between the local concentration of positive and negative ions. Consequently, the net charge density $\\rho$ is significantly different from zero in this region. Therefore, the Poisson equation in its full form must be used to describe the potential distribution within the EDL. The compact layer (Option A) and the diffuse layer (Option D) are both parts of the EDL where $\\rho \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Far from the Electrode Surface:** The problem states that the characteristic length scale of this charge imbalance is the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. This length represents how far the electrostatic field from the electrode \"penetrates\" into the electrolyte before being effectively screened by the cloud of counter-ions. At distances from the electrode surface much greater than the Debye length ($x \\gg \\lambda_D$), we enter the \"bulk\" electrolyte region. In this bulk region, the influence of the charged electrode is negligible. The electrolyte re-establishes local electroneutrality, meaning that on any small but macroscopic volume element, the concentration of positive ions is effectively equal to the concentration of negative ions. This results in a net charge density $\\rho \\approx 0$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since $\\rho \\approx 0$ in the bulk electrolyte, the Poisson equation $\\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}$ simplifies to $\\nabla^2 \\phi \\approx 0$, which is the Laplace equation. This makes Option C the correct choice.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect. The compact layer has a very high charge density.\n- Option B is incorrect. While the electrolyte as a whole is charge neutral, there is a local charge imbalance near the electrode within the EDL, so the simplification is not valid everywhere.\n- Option D is incorrect. The diffuse layer is characterized by a decaying but still significant non-zero charge density.\n- Option E is incorrect. It misunderstands the concept of screening. The ions in the EDL screen the electrode's charge, allowing the bulk of the electrolyte to remain locally neutral ($\\rho \\approx 0$) even though a potential gradient might exist due to current flow (which would be described by Laplace's equation for a steady current in a uniform conductor).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1579439"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the general structure of the charged interface, we now examine a special and insightful case: an electrode held at its potential of zero charge (PZC).

If $\\rho(x)=0$ everywhere and the electric field were constant and non-zero, then $\\phi$ would be linear and could not remain finite with $\\phi(x\\to\\infty)=0$, so a non-zero constant field is impossible.
