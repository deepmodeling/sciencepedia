Mastering this will help you interpret electrocapillary data and build an intuitive feel for the charge state of an electrode.", "problem": "An electrochemist is studying the interface between a liquid mercury electrode and an aqueous solution of a salt that does not specifically adsorb onto the mercury surface. The experiment aims to understand the relationship between the electrode's electrical potential, $E$, and the interfacial tension, $\\gamma$, at the mercury-solution boundary. The electrochemist measures an initial interfacial tension $\\gamma_1$ at an electrode potential $E_1$. Upon adjusting the potential to a slightly more positive value, $E_2 = E_1 + \\Delta E$ (where $\\Delta E$ is a small, positive increment), they observe that the new interfacial tension, $\\gamma_2$, is greater than the initial tension ($\\gamma_2 > \\gamma_1$).\n\nBased solely on this observation, what can be concluded about the surface charge density, $\\sigma$, on the mercury electrode when it is held at the potential $E_1$?

The experiment must be faulty, as interfacial tension cannot increase when the potential is made more positive.", "solution": "The relationship between interfacial tension ($\\gamma$), electrode potential ($E$), and surface charge density ($\\sigma$) for an ideal polarized electrode is described by the Lippmann equation. Assuming constant temperature, pressure, and chemical composition of the electrolyte, the equation is:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E} \\right) = -\\sigma\n$$\nThis equation states that the rate of change of interfacial tension with respect to the electrode potential is equal to the negative of the surface charge density.\n\nIn the experiment, the potential is changed from an initial value $E_1$ to a new, more positive value $E_2$. This means the change in potential, $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$, is positive. It is observed that the interfacial tension increases, meaning the change in tension, $\\Delta \\gamma = \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_1$, is also positive.\n\nFor a small change in potential, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E}$ can be approximated by the ratio of the changes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\gamma_2 - \\gamma_1}{E_2 - E_1}\n$$\nSince both the numerator ($\\gamma_2 - \\gamma_1$) and the denominator ($E_2 - E_1$) are positive, the value of the derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E}$ at or near the potential $E_1$ must be positive.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E} > 0\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the Lippmann equation:\n$$\n-\\sigma > 0\n$$\nTo find the sign of $\\sigma$, we multiply both sides of the inequality by -1. Remember that multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$\n\\sigma  0\n$$\nTherefore, the surface charge density on the electrode at potential $E_1$ is negative. This corresponds to option B.\n\nLet's analyze the other options to confirm our choice:\n- A: If $\\sigma > 0$, the Lippmann equation would predict $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E}  0$. This means that making the potential more positive would cause the interfacial tension to *decrease*, which contradicts the observation. So, A is incorrect.\n- C: If $\\sigma = 0$, the electrode is at the PZC. At this point, $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E} = 0$, which means the interfacial tension is at a local maximum. Any small change in potential (either positive or negative) from the PZC would result in a *decrease* in interfacial tension. This contradicts the observation that tension increased. So, C is incorrect.\n- D: The PZC is the potential at which $\\sigma = 0$. For non-specifically adsorbing electrolytes, potentials more positive than the PZC result in a positive surface charge ($\\sigma > 0$), and potentials more negative than the PZC result in a negative surface charge ($\\sigma  0$). Since we have determined that $\\sigma  0$, it must be that the potential $E_1$ is more negative than the PZC, i.e., $E_1  E_{PZC}$. Option D states the opposite, so it is incorrect.\n- E: The relationship between $\\gamma$ and $E$ is typically parabolic, with a maximum at the PZC. On the branch of the parabola where $E  E_{PZC}$ (the \"negative branch\"), the surface is negatively charged, and the slope $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial E}$ is positive. This means that as the potential becomes less negative (i.e., more positive) and moves towards the PZC, the interfacial tension increases. The observation is therefore physically valid. So, E is incorrect.\n\nThe only conclusion consistent with the experimental observation and the Lippmann equation is that the surface charge density is negative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1580439"}, {"introduction": "At the potential of zero charge, the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) undergoes a significant change, which is reflected in its capacitance.
