Particles of the silver anode flaked off, were suspended in the anolyte, and were included in the sample that was subsequently prepared for analysis by dissolving all components in acid.\n\nB. The porous divider separating the anode and central compartments was partially clogged, which impeded the migration of ions between the compartments.\n\nC. Significant evaporation of water occurred from the anolyte compartment due to localized heating near the anode, concentrating the solution.\n\nD. When withdrawing the anolyte for analysis, some solution from the central compartment, which remains at the initial concentration, was accidentally drawn into the pipette along with the anolyte sample.\n\nE. The student did not completely drain the anolyte compartment, leaving a small amount of the final anolyte solution behind and analyzing only the portion that was successfully removed.", "solution": "Let $Q$ be the total charge passed and $F$ the Faraday constant. Define $N = Q/F$ as the moles of electrons (and hence of Ag) transferred at the electrodes. In a Hittorf experiment with silver electrodes in $AgNO_{3}$ solution, the electrode reactions are:\nanode: $Ag(s) \\to Ag^{+} + e^{-}$, producing $N$ moles of $Ag^{+}$ in the anode compartment,\ncathode: $Ag^{+} + e^{-} \\to Ag(s)$, consuming $N$ moles of $Ag^{+}$ in the cathode compartment.\n\nLet $t_{+}$ be the cation transport number of $Ag^{+}$, so $t_{-} = 1 - t_{+}$ for $NO_{3}^{-}$.

This is opposite to the true behavior (the anode compartment should show an increase in $AgNO_{3}$), so the only way to obtain $t_{+}^{\\text{app}} > 1$ under otherwise accurate charge measurement and accurate chemical analysis of the prepared sample is a sampling/handling error that makes the analyzed sample have a lower $AgNO_{3}$ content than the true final anolyte.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\nA. Inclusion of flaked silver that is later dissolved adds extra $Ag^{+}$ to the analyzed sample, increasing the measured $AgNO_{3}$ amount. This would make $\\Delta n_{\\text{salt, anode}}^{\\text{app}}$ more positive and hence $t_{+}^{\\text{app}} < 1$, not $> 1$. Not plausible.\n\nB. A clogged porous divider alters rates and gradients but cannot make the anode compartment lose salt; physically $t_{+}$ remains in $[0,1]$. No mechanism to yield $\\Delta n_{\\text{salt, anode}}^{\\text{app}} < 0$. Not plausible.\n\nC. Evaporation concentrates the anolyte (removes solvent), increasing measured concentration and the apparent $AgNO_{3}$ amount unless correctly volume-corrected; this would decrease $t_{+}^{\\text{app}}$, not increase it above 1. Not plausible.\n\nD. Drawing some solution from the central compartment (at the initial, lower concentration) into the anolyte sample dilutes the analyzed sample. The chemical analysis can be accurate for that mixed sample, yet the inferred change for the anolyte becomes underestimated and can even appear negative, i.e., $\\Delta n_{\\text{salt, anode}}^{\\text{app}} < 0$, which yields $t_{+}^{\\text{app}} > 1$. This directly explains the non-physical result.\n\nE. Not completely draining the anolyte compartment but analyzing only the removed portion, if well mixed, does not bias the measured composition; without an additional specified stratification error, this does not systematically yield an apparent decrease. Not plausible as a single clear cause.\n\nTherefore, the single procedural error that plausibly explains $t_{Ag^{+}}^{\\text{app}} = 1.15$ is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1564976"}]}
