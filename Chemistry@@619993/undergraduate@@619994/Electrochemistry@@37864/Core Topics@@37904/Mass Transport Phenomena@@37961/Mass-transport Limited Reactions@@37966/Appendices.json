In the experiment, a large potential is suddenly applied to a planar working electrode of surface area $A$. This potential step is sufficient to cause the concentration of the reactant species at the electrode surface to become zero instantaneously. The reaction is then limited purely by the rate at which the reactant species, with a bulk concentration $c_{b}$ and diffusion coefficient $D$, can diffuse to the electrode surface.

The student expects the resulting current, $I(t)$, to decay over time according to the Cottrell equation, which is valid for planar diffusion in a quiescent solution. However, after an initial period of decay lasting for about 20 seconds, the measured current stabilizes and remains nearly constant for the next several minutes.\n\nWhich of the following phenomena is the most likely cause for this observed deviation from the ideal Cottrell behavior?\n\nA. Migration of the negatively charged $[\\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{4-}$ ions in the electric field, which provides a steady flux to the electrode.\n\nB.

In a solution with a high concentration of supporting electrolyte, electroneutrality holds over macroscopic distances, and the potential gradient in the bulk is suppressed so that $\\nabla \\phi \\approx 0$. Thus, migration of the electroactive species is negligible compared to diffusion and any convection that may arise.\n\nThe observation is that after an initial Cottrell-like decay for about $20$ seconds, the current becomes nearly constant for minutes. A constant diffusion-limited current indicates a steady effective mass-transfer boundary layer of thickness $\\delta$, for which\n$$\nI_{\\text{lim}} = n F A \\frac{D C^{*}}{\\delta},\n$$\nwhich is independent of time. Such a boundary layer is not produced by pure diffusion in a quiescent solution; rather, it arises from convection. In unstirred beakers, buoyancy-driven natural convection can develop because the electrochemical reaction creates concentration gradients that alter the local solution density near the electrode. Once the density gradient is sufficiently large, buoyancy overcomes viscous and diffusive damping, and convection sets in. This onset can be rationalized in terms of a concentration Rayleigh number,\n$$\n\\text{Ra} \\sim \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta C L^{3}}{\\nu D},\n$$\nwhere $g$ is gravitational acceleration, $\\beta$ is the solutal expansion coefficient relating density to concentration, $\\Delta C$ is the concentration difference formed near the electrode, $L$ is a characteristic length, and $\\nu$ is kinematic viscosity. When $\\text{Ra}$ exceeds a critical value, natural convection establishes a steady convective boundary layer, leading to a time-independent limiting current consistent with the observation.\n\nWe now examine the options:\n\nA. Migration term $-z u F C \\nabla \\phi$ is negligible due to the $1.0\\ \\text{M}$ supporting electrolyte, which makes $\\nabla \\phi \\approx 0$ in the bulk. Migration cannot sustain a steady flux under these conditions; thus A is not the cause.\n\nB. Double-layer charging current following a potential step is given by a capacitive transient, often modeled as $i_{\\text{dl}}(t) = \\frac{\\Delta E}{R_{\\text{u}}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{\\text{u}} C_{\\text{dl}}}\\right)$, with time constant $\\tau = R_{\\text{u}} C_{\\text{dl}}$. This decays rapidly and cannot persist for minutes, nor does it produce a constant faradaic current. Hence B is not consistent.\n\nC. Natural convection due to density gradients produced by concentration changes near the electrode provides a steady convective boundary layer and therefore a constant limiting current $I_{\\text{lim}} = n F A D C^{*} / \\delta$ after an initial diffusion-controlled transient. This matches the observed transition from Cottrell decay to a nearly constant current.\n\nD. Passivation by adsorption would typically decrease the active area or block sites, leading to a further decline in current over time, not a stable constant current plateau. The redox couple $[\\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{4-}/[\\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{3-}$ on platinum is not known to produce such sustained passivation consistent with the described behavior.\n\nE. Intrinsically slow electron transfer would impose kinetic control from the outset. The problem states the potential step is sufficiently large to render the process mass-transport limited initially, as evidenced by the initial Cottrell decay; a switch to kinetic limitation after $20$ seconds is not expected, and kinetics do not typically yield a long, constant current plateau in this configuration without a concomitant mass-transfer limitation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause is the onset of natural convection due to density gradients generated by the electrochemical reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1570907"}, {"introduction": "To overcome the unpredictability of natural convection, electrochemists often use a rotating disk electrode (RDE) to establish well-defined, forced convection.

This prediction relies on the von Karman laminar boundary layer solution and implies a straight line of $i_{L}$ versus $\\omega^{1/2}$ through the origin.\n\nThe observed deviation is that at very high $\\omega$ the measured limiting current $i_{\\text{meas}}$ exceeds the Levich prediction. We test each option against the governing transport and kinetic relations.\n\nFor finite electron-transfer kinetics, the Koutecký–Levich relation applies:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{1}{i_{K}} + \\frac{1}{i_{L}},\n$$\nwith $i_{K}$ the kinetic current and $i_{L}$ the Levich mass-transport limit.
