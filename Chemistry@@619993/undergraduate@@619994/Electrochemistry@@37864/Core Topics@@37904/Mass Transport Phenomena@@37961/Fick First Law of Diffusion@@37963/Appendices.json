The patch consists of a polymer hydrogel layer with a uniform thickness $L$. This hydrogel is saturated with a lithium chloride ($LiCl$) solution, resulting in an initial, uniform concentration of $Li^{+}$ ions, $C_1$. To test the passive diffusion rate, the patch is placed in contact with a large, well-stirred volume of a saline solution that initially contains no lithium ions, so the concentration of $Li^{+}$ at the interface with the saline solution can be considered to be $C_2 = 0$.
