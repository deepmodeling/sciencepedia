This is because the copper wire effectively \"shorts\" the two half-cells in a way that equalizes the potentials of the two external electrodes. For a potential difference to develop and be sustained as in a galvanic cell, a salt bridge is required. A salt bridge allows for the transport of ions to maintain charge neutrality in each half-cell as electrons flow through the external circuit. An electron-conducting wire cannot perform this function. Instead, it establishes its own equilibria with the solutions, forcing the entire metallic part of the circuit (the two electrodes and the connecting wire) to be at the same potential.
