Changing the temperature modifies the factor $RT/(nF)$ linearly with $T$. A shift from $298.15$ K to $273.15$ K would change the predicted $E$ by only a modest fraction and contradicts the assumption that the temperature probe is accurate, so this is not the most plausible explanation.\n\nB. The mass of the solid copper electrodes does not enter the Nernst equation and does not affect the electrode potentials at equilibrium. Thus it cannot change the open-circuit cell potential.\n\nC. Contamination of the $1.00$ M solution with chloride can form strong chloro-copper(II) complexes such as $\\left[\\text{CuCl}_{4}\\right]^{2-}$. This reduces the free $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$ activity in the cathode compartment, i.e., $a_{\\text{cath}}(\\text{Cu}^{2+}) \\ll c_{\\text{cath}}(\\text{Cu}^{2+})$, thereby decreasing the activity ratio $a_{\\text{cath}}/a_{\\text{an}}$ in the Nernst expression and lowering $E$ relative to the ideal prediction. This is a direct chemical effect on activities and is fully consistent with the observed smaller open-circuit potential.\n\nD. A high internal resistance produces an $iR$ drop only when current flows. At open circuit, $i=0$, so the potential drop across internal resistance is $iR_{\\text{int}}=0$, and the measured open-circuit potential equals the equilibrium potential given by the Nernst equation. With an accurate voltmeter (as assumed), internal resistance cannot explain the discrepancy, and in any case it is not a chemical cause.\n\nE. Using $\\text{Cu}^{+}$ instead of $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$ would change the redox couple to $\\text{Cu}^{+}/\\text{Cu}$ with $n=1$, altering the Nernst slope. For the same concentration ratio, this would increase the predicted potential rather than decrease it. Moreover, $\\text{Cu}^{+}$ is unstable in aqueous solution and undergoes disproportionation, and this option contradicts the assumption that the solutions were prepared correctly for $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$. Hence this is not a plausible explanation for a lower measured potential.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible chemical explanation for a significantly smaller-than-ideal open-circuit potential is chloride-induced complexation that lowers the free $\\text{Cu}^{2+}$ activity in the concentrated half-cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1555093"}]}
