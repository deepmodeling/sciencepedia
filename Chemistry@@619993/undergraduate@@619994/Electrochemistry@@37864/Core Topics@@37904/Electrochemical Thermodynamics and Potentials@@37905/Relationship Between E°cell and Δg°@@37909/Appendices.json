The relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change and the standard cell potential is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = -nFE^\\circ_{cell}\n$$\nHere, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the cell reaction, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. For a process to be thermodynamically spontaneous under standard conditions, its standard Gibbs free energy change must be negative ($\\Delta G^\\circ < 0$).\n\nA galvanic cell, by definition, is a device that uses a spontaneous chemical reaction to generate electrical energy. Therefore, for a functioning galvanic cell, the reaction must be spontaneous. This means $\\Delta G^\\circ$ must be negative. Looking at the correct equation, since $n$ and $F$ are both positive constants, a negative $\\Delta G^\\circ$ requires a positive standard cell potential ($E^\\circ_{cell} > 0$).

The researcher uses the incorrect formula:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ_{incorrect} = nFE^\\circ_{cell}\n$$\nWe need to determine the sign of the result from this incorrect calculation.\n1.  The number of moles of electrons transferred, $n$, is an integer count and is always positive.\n2.  The Faraday constant, $F$, is a fundamental physical constant and is positive ($F \\approx 96,485 \\text{ C/mol}$).\n3.

A positive value for the standard Gibbs free energy change indicates that the forward reaction is thermodynamically non-spontaneous under standard conditions. A non-spontaneous reaction does not proceed on its own; it requires a continuous input of energy from an external source to be driven in the forward direction. In an electrochemical context, a cell that uses an external power source to drive a non-spontaneous reaction is called an electrolytic cell, not a galvanic cell.\n\nTherefore, based on the incorrect calculation yielding a positive $\\Delta G^\\circ$, the researcher would erroneously conclude that the reaction is non-spontaneous and would not function as a power source, instead requiring external energy input. This matches option A.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n-   Option B: This is the correct physical conclusion for a galvanic cell with a positive $E^\\circ_{cell}$, but it contradicts the result of the flawed calculation.\n-   Option C: This conclusion corresponds to $\\Delta G^\\circ = 0$ and $E^\\circ_{cell} = 0$, which is not the case here.\n-   Option D: The sign of $\\Delta G^\\circ_{incorrect}$ is definitively positive because $n$, $F$, and $E^\\circ_{cell}$ are all positive. The specific values are not needed to determine the sign.\n-   Option E: This is incorrect. Both cell potential and Gibbs free energy are measures of spontaneity, and they must be consistent.
