The term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{F\\eta}{RT}\\right)$ is greater than 1 and grows exponentially as $\\eta$ increases. Therefore, the net current density $j$ becomes large and positive, increasing exponentially with $\\eta$.\n\nCase 2: Negative overpotential ($\\eta  0$).\nThis condition drives the cathodic (reduction) process. As $\\eta$ becomes more negative (e.g., $\\eta \\to -\\infty$), the argument of the exponential term $\\frac{F\\eta}{RT}$ becomes a large negative number.\n$$\\lim_{\\eta \\to -\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F\\eta}{RT}\\right) = 0$$\nIn this limit, the net current density $j$ approaches:\n$$j \\to j_0 (0 - 1) = -j_0$$\nThis means that for large negative overpotentials, the current density does not grow infinitely but instead approaches a constant, limiting cathodic value of $-j_0$.\n\nCase 3: Zero overpotential ($\\eta = 0$).\nAt equilibrium, where the overpotential is zero, the equation gives:\n$$j = j_0 [\\exp(0) - 1] = j_0 [1-1] = 0$$\nThis is consistent with the definition of equilibrium, where the net current is zero.\n\nThe overall shape of the $j$ vs. $\\eta$ curve is highly asymmetric.

The activation energy for the cathodic reaction, $\\Delta G_c^{\\ddagger}$, is related to the zero-potential barrier, $\\Delta G_{c,0}^{\\ddagger}$, by:\n$$\\Delta G_c^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta G_{c,0}^{\\ddagger} - \\alpha F \\eta$$\nSimilarly, the activation energy for the anodic reaction, $\\Delta G_a^{\\ddagger}$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta G_a^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta G_{a,0}^{\\ddagger} + (1-\\alpha) F \\eta$$\n\nIf $\\alpha = 0$:\nThe cathodic activation energy becomes:\n$$\\Delta G_c^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta G_{c,0}^{\\ddagger} - 0 \\cdot F \\eta = \\Delta G_{c,0}^{\\ddagger}$$\nThis means the activation energy barrier for the cathodic reaction is constant and completely independent of the applied potential. This is why the cathodic current saturates at a limiting value ($j_c = j_0 \\exp(-\\alpha F\\eta/RT) = j_0 \\exp(0) = j_0$).\n\nThe anodic activation energy becomes:\n$$\\Delta G_a^{\\ddagger} = \\Delta G_{a,0}^{\\ddagger} + (1-0) F \\eta = \\Delta G_{a,0}^{\\ddagger} + F \\eta$$\nThe activation energy for the anodic reaction is fully modulated by the overpotential, decreasing as $\\eta$ becomes more positive.

This describes the case for $\\alpha=1$, where the anodic current would be constant and the cathodic current would be exponential. This is incorrect.\n\nC. This describes the symmetric case, which occurs when $\\alpha \\approx 0.5$. This is incorrect.\n\nD.
