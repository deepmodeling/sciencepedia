This consumption can lead to a difference between the concentration of $O$ at the electrode surface, denoted as $C_O^s$, and its concentration in the bulk of the solution, $C_O^b$. This concentration difference gives rise to a potential shift known as the concentration overpotential, $\\eta_c$.\n\nFor this reaction, the concentration overpotential related to the reactant species $O$ is given by the equation:\n$$ \\eta_c = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_O^s}{C_O^b}\\right) $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\nConsider a scenario where the electrochemical cell is at open circuit, meaning the net current flowing through the electrode is exactly zero. Under this specific condition, what is the theoretical value of the concentration overpotential, $\\eta_c$, and what is the fundamental reason for this value?\n\nA. $\\eta_c = 0$, because at zero net current, the system is at equilibrium, which implies that the surface concentration of the reactant is equal to its bulk concentration.\n\nB. $\\eta_c > 0$, because a positive potential is always necessary to initiate the mass transport of reactants towards the electrode, even in the absence of current.\n\nC. $\\eta_c  0$, because even at zero net current, the dynamic equilibrium involves a non-zero rate for the forward reaction, causing a slight depletion of the reactant at the surface.\n\nD. The value depends on the specific reaction and cannot be determined without knowing the exchange current density, $i_0$.\n\nE. $\\eta_c = 0$, because at zero current, the temperature $T$ of the system must be absolute zero, which makes the entire expression zero.", "solution": "The given reaction is the cathodic reduction $O + z e^{-} \\rightarrow R$.
