A bound state is defined as a stationary state with energy $E  0$ whose wavefunction is normalizable.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical reason why this potential cannot support any bound states?\n\nA. The uncertainty principle dictates that a particle localized by the infinitely narrow potential must have an infinite kinetic energy, which always exceeds any possible binding energy.\n\nB. A bound state in a symmetric potential must have definite parity (be either a purely even or purely odd function). An odd wavefunction must be zero at the origin, $\\psi(0)=0$, which is a trivial solution, and an even wavefunction cannot satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by a repulsive potential.\n\nC. The time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation requires a discontinuity (a \"kink\") in the slope of the wavefunction at the delta-function's location.
