However, the correspondence principle dictates that in the limit of large quantum numbers, this discreteness should become unnoticeable. This first exercise provides a quantitative look at this transition by examining the simplest quantum system: the particle in a one-dimensional box. By calculating the quantum number $n$ at which adjacent energy levels become nearly indistinguishable, you will see firsthand how the quantum energy ladder effectively smooths into the continuous energy spectrum of a classical particle [@problem_id:1402980].", "problem": "An electron is confined within a one-dimensional region of length $L$. This system can be modeled as a particle in an infinite potential well, where the potential energy is zero for $0 < x < L$ and infinite elsewhere. The energy levels of the electron are quantized and described by a principal quantum number $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer ($n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$). As $n$ becomes very large, the system is expected to behave more classically, meaning the discrete nature of the energy levels becomes less apparent.\n\nYour task is to quantify this transition. Determine the smallest integer quantum number $n$ for which the relative difference between the energy of the state $n+1$ and the energy of the state $n$ is less than $0.1\\%$. The relative difference is defined as $\\frac{E_{n+1} - E_n}{E_n}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the smallest integer quantum number $n$ for which the relative energy difference between adjacent levels in a one-dimensional infinite potential well is less than $0.1\\%$.\n\nFirst, we write down the expression for the quantized energy levels of a particle of mass $m$ in a one-dimensional box of length $L$. The energy of the $n$-th state, $E_n$, is given by:\n$$\nE_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe energy of the next higher state, $E_{n+1}$, is found by replacing $n$ with $n+1$:\n$$\nE_{n+1} = \\frac{(n+1)^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy difference, $\\Delta E$, between these adjacent levels:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = \\frac{(n+1)^2 h^2}{8mL^2} - \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} \\left( (n+1)^2 - n^2 \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the $(n+1)^2$ term gives $n^2 + 2n + 1$. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} (n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2) = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} (2n+1)\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the relative difference is defined as $\\frac{E_{n+1} - E_n}{E_n}$, which is $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E_n}$. Let's compute this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta E}{E_n} = \\frac{\\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} (2n+1)}{\\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}}\n$$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$ cancels out, leaving a simple expression that depends only on $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta E}{E_n} = \\frac{2n+1}{n^2}\n$$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer $n$ for which this relative difference is less than $0.1\\%$.

Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n^2$ is always positive, so we can multiply both sides by $n^2$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n2n+1 < 0.001 n^2\n$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form gives:\n$$\n0.001 n^2 - 2n - 1 > 0\n$$\nTo find the values of $n$ for which this inequality holds, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation $0.001 n^2 - 2n - 1 = 0$ using the quadratic formula $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=0.001$, $b=-2$, and $c=-1$.\n$$\nn = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(0.001)(-1)}}{2(0.001)}\n$$\n$$\nn = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 0.004}}{0.002} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4.004}}{0.002}\n$$\nSince the quantum number $n$ must be positive, we only consider the solution with the plus sign:\n$$\nn = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{4.004}}{0.002}\n$$\nCalculating the value of the square root: $\\sqrt{4.004} \\approx 2.00099975$.\n$$\nn \\approx \\frac{2 + 2.00099975}{0.002} = \\frac{4.00099975}{0.002} \\approx 2000.499875\n$$\nThe quadratic expression $0.001 n^2 - 2n - 1$ represents an upward-opening parabola. Therefore, the inequality $0.001 n^2 - 2n - 1 > 0$ is satisfied for values of $n$ greater than the larger root.\nSo, we need $n > 2000.499875$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest *integer* quantum number $n$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer greater than $2000.499875$ is $n=2001$.\n\nTo verify, let's check the values for $n=2000$ and $n=2001$.\nFor $n=2000$:\n$$ \\frac{2(2000)+1}{(2000)^2} = \\frac{4001}{4000000} = 0.00100025 $$\nThis value is greater than $0.001$, so $n=2000$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\nFor $n=2001$:\n$$ \\frac{2(2001)+1}{(2001)^2} = \\frac{4003}{4004001} \\approx 0.00099975 $$\nThis value is less than $0.001$, so $n=2001$ is the first integer to satisfy the condition.\n\nThus, the smallest integer quantum number is 2001.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2001}$$", "id": "1402980"}, {"introduction": "Having explored how energy levels converge, we now turn our attention to the spatial distribution of a particle.
