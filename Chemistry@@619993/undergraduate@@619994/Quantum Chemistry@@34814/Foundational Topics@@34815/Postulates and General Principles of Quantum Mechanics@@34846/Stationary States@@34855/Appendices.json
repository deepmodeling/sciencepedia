Understanding why such a combination remains a stationary state is key to justifying the familiar shapes and orientations of orbitals used in bonding theories.", "problem": "In the quantum mechanical description of the hydrogen atom, the stationary states are given by the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator, $\\hat{H}$. These are typically represented as the complex-valued orbitals $\\psi_{n,l,m_l}$. However, for chemical applications, it is often more convenient to use real-valued orbitals, which are specific linear combinations of the complex ones.

No, because the state is not an eigenfunction of the z-component of the angular momentum operator, $\\hat{L}_z$. A state must be an eigenfunction of a complete set of commuting observables to be stationary.\n\nE. No, because the state $\\Psi_{rot}$ has a different spatial orientation than the basis orbitals $\\psi_{2p_x}$ and $\\psi_{2p_y}$, and only states aligned with the coordinate axes can be stationary states.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to determine whether the given state $\\Psi_{rot}$ is a stationary state. By definition, a quantum state is a stationary state if and only if it is an eigenfunction of the time-independent Hamiltonian operator, $\\hat{H}$. This means that if $\\Psi$ is a stationary state, it must satisfy the eigenvalue equation $\\hat{H}\\Psi = E\\Psi$, where $E$ is a constant representing the energy of the state.\n\nThe state in question is given by the linear combination:\n$$\n\\Psi_{rot} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_{2p_x} - \\psi_{2p_y})\n$$\nThe components of this superposition are the real-valued hydrogen atom orbitals $\\psi_{2p_x}$ and $\\psi_{2p_y}$. For the hydrogen atom, the energy of an orbital is determined solely by the principal quantum number, $n$. The energy eigenvalues are given by the formula $E_n = -E_R/n^2$, where $E_R$ is a constant (the Rydberg energy).\n\nBoth the $\\psi_{2p_x}$ and $\\psi_{2p_y}$ orbitals have the same principal quantum number, $n=2$. Therefore, they are both eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian with the same energy eigenvalue, $E_2$.\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\psi_{2p_x} = E_2 \\psi_{2p_x}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\psi_{2p_y} = E_2 \\psi_{2p_y}\n$$\nStates that are eigenfunctions of an operator with the same eigenvalue are called degenerate. Thus, $\\psi_{2p_x}$ and $\\psi_{2p_y}$ are degenerate energy eigenfunctions.\n\nNow, we test if $\\Psi_{rot}$ is an eigenfunction of $\\hat{H}$. We apply the Hamiltonian operator to $\\Psi_{rot}$ and utilize the linearity of the operator:\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\Psi_{rot} = \\hat{H}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_{2p_x} - \\psi_{2p_y})\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\Psi_{rot} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\hat{H}\\psi_{2p_x} - \\hat{H}\\psi_{2p_y} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the known eigenvalue relations for $\\psi_{2p_x}$ and $\\psi_{2p_y}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\Psi_{rot} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( E_2\\psi_{2p_x} - E_2\\psi_{2p_y} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the constant energy eigenvalue $E_2$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\Psi_{rot} = E_2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\psi_{2p_x} - \\psi_{2p_y}) \\right]\n$$\nThe expression in the brackets is the original state $\\Psi_{rot}$.

According to the definition, this makes $\\Psi_{rot}$ a stationary state.\n\nThis demonstrates a general principle: any linear combination of degenerate eigenfunctions of an operator is also an eigenfunction of that operator with the same eigenvalue.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. This statement is false. A linear combination of non-degenerate energy eigenfunctions (e.g., $\\psi_{1s}$ and $\\psi_{2s}$) is not an energy eigenfunction.\nB. This statement is correct. It precisely states the principle of linear combinations of degenerate states, which we have used to show that $\\Psi_{rot}$ is a stationary state.\nC. This is false. While the potential is spherically symmetric, most stationary states (like the p, d, f orbitals) are not. Only s-orbitals ($l=0$) are spherically symmetric.\nD. This is false. While it is true that $\\Psi_{rot}$ is not an eigenfunction of $\\hat{L}_z$, this is not a condition for a state to be stationary. The only requirement is that it must be an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian.\nE. This is false. The orientation of a state in space does not determine whether it is stationary. The allowed stationary states are determined by the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, and as we have shown, this includes superpositions of degenerate states which may have different orientations.\n\nTherefore, the only correct option is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1399203"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that a superposition of degenerate orbitals can form a new stationary state.
