The governing equation is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE). Inside the box, where the potential $V(x)=0$, the TISE is:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E \\psi(x)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -k^2 \\psi(x)$$\nwhere $k^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}$. The general solution to this second-order differential equation is:\n$$\\psi(x) = C \\sin(kx) + D \\cos(kx)$$\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n**Scenario A: Dirichlet Boundary Conditions**\n\nIn this scenario, the boundary conditions are $\\psi(0)=0$ and $\\psi(L)=0$.\nFirst, apply the condition at $x=0$:\n$$\\psi(0) = C \\sin(k \\cdot 0) + D \\cos(k \\cdot 0) = C(0) + D(1) = D$$\nSince we must have $\\psi(0)=0$, this implies $D=0$.

This condition is met when $kL$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$:\n$$kL = n_A \\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n_A = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$$\nThe case $n_A=0$ would mean $k=0$, which leads to $\\psi(x)=0$ everywhere, a trivial solution that represents no particle. Thus, the quantum number $n_A$ starts from 1.\n\nNow we relate $k$ back to energy $E$:\n$$k^2 L^2 = (n_A \\pi)^2 \\implies \\frac{2mE_{A,n_A}}{\\hbar^2} L^2 = n_A^2 \\pi^2$$\nSolving for the energy eigenvalues $E_{A,n_A}$:\n$$E_{A,n_A} = \\frac{n_A^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}, \\quad \\text{for } n_A=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$$\nThe problem defines $n$ as the index for the energy states, so $n=n_A$.
