They decide to compute the molecule's ground state electronic energy at a series of internuclear distances, $R$, starting from the equilibrium bond length and extending to a large separation. For this task, they employ the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) method, which approximates the electronic wavefunction as a single Slater determinant composed of doubly-occupied molecular orbitals. The student observes that for internuclear distances near the equilibrium value, the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) procedure converges rapidly to a stable energy. However, as they increase $R$ to values significantly larger than the equilibrium bond length (e.g., $R > 2.5$ Angstroms), the SCF calculation consistently fails to converge. Despite increasing the maximum number of SCF cycles and trying different convergence algorithms, the energy and orbital coefficients oscillate and never reach a stable solution.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for this well-known computational issue?\n\nA. The chosen basis set is too small to correctly describe the electron density of the separated nitrogen atoms, leading to a numerically unstable calculation.\n\nB. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which assumes fixed nuclei, breaks down at large internuclear separations, invalidating the entire computational approach.\n\nC. At large separations, the ground state electronic wavefunction acquires significant multi-reference character and can no longer be well-approximated by the single-determinant RHF ansatz.\n\nD. The computational cost of the RHF method scales poorly with the size of the molecular system, and separating the atoms effectively creates a larger, more complex system that exceeds the available computational resources.\n\nE. Relativistic effects, which are ignored in the standard RHF method, become dominant when the covalent bond is broken and are the primary cause of the convergence failure.", "solution": "We analyze why a Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) Self-Consistent Field (SCF) calculation for a homonuclear diatomic such as $\\text{N}_2$ converges near equilibrium but fails to converge at large internuclear separation $R$.\n\n1. RHF ansatz and SCF stationarity. In RHF, the $N$-electron wavefunction is constrained to a single Slater determinant with doubly occupied spatial orbitals, i.e., each occupied spatial orbital $\\phi_i$ is occupied by an $\\alpha$ and a $\\beta$ electron. The RHF energy is a functional $E[\\{\\phi_i\\}]$ that is minimized under orthonormality constraints, giving the Fock equations\n$$\n\\hat{F}[\\{\\phi_i\\}]\\,\\phi_p=\\epsilon_p\\,\\phi_p,\n$$\nwith the Fock operator $\\hat{F}$ depending on the occupied orbitals via Coulomb and exchange terms. SCF convergence relies on the existence of a well-defined minimum (or at least a stable stationary point) of $E$ under the RHF constraint.\n\n2. Behavior near equilibrium. Near the equilibrium bond length, the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals are well separated in energy. The HOMO-LUMO gap\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon(R)=\\epsilon_{\\text{LUMO}}(R)-\\epsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}(R)\n$$\nis appreciable, providing a unique, stable closed-shell solution. Iterative SCF updates converge rapidly to this local minimum.\n\n3. Large-$R$ limit and near-degeneracy. As $R$ increases, the overlap between atomic centers decreases and the bonding-antibonding splitting collapses. In a simple two-orbital model built from atomic orbitals $\\{\\phi_A,\\phi_B\\}$, the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations form bonding and antibonding MOs. The splitting $\\Delta \\epsilon(R)$ scales with the resonance integral between centers, which decays as the interatomic overlap $S(R) \\to 0$; hence\n$$\n\\lim_{R\\to \\infty}\\Delta \\epsilon(R)=0.\n$$\nThus, multiple determinants that differ by occupations of nearly degenerate orbitals become quasi-degenerate in energy.\n\n4. Exact dissociation and multireference character. The exact ground state at large $R$ is dominated by strong static (near-degeneracy) correlation. For the prototypical two-electron, two-orbital case (e.g., the minimal-basis dissociation picture as in H$_{2}$, generalized here as an illustration), the correct singlet dissociation state is a linear combination of determinants,\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\lvert \\sigma_{g}^{2} \\rangle - \\lvert \\sigma_{u}^{2} \\rangle),\n$$\nwhich corresponds in the atomic picture to one electron localized on each fragment with opposite spins (a Heitler-London-type structure). A single closed-shell RHF determinant enforces double occupancy of a single spatial orbital and cannot represent this superposition. For $\\text{N}_2$, multiple near-degenerate configurations arise as several bonding-antibonding pairs collapse in energy, further amplifying multireference character.\n\n5. Consequences for RHF SCF convergence. Because the true minimum lies outside the RHF manifold, the restricted closed-shell solution becomes unstable as $R$ increases. The RHF energy Hessian develops negative eigenvalues (instabilities), and the vanishing $\\Delta \\epsilon(R)$ leads to strong coupling between occupied and virtual spaces, causing oscillatory behavior in the SCF iterations. An unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) calculation often converges by breaking spin symmetry (spin contamination), or a multireference method (e.g., CASSCF) is required to capture the correct static correlation while preserving the appropriate spin symmetry. The failure is therefore fundamentally due to the breakdown of the single-determinant, closed-shell ansatz in the dissociation regime.\n\n6. Elimination of alternative explanations.\n- A is not the primary cause: although basis set size affects quantitative accuracy, the RHF failure persists even with large or complete basis sets because it is due to the inadequacy of the single-determinant constraint in the presence of strong static correlation.\n- B is incorrect: the Born-Oppenheimer approximation remains valid for fixed-nuclei electronic structure at large $R$.\n- D is incorrect: computational cost does not increase with $R$ for a fixed electron count and basis; the nonconvergence is not due to system size.\n- E is incorrect: relativistic effects are negligible for nitrogen and are not the driver of SCF failure in bond dissociation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physical explanation is that at large separations the ground state acquires strong multireference character that cannot be described by the single-determinant RHF ansatz.\n\nHence, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1383226"}, {"introduction": "Once we establish the need for a multi-reference method like CASSCF, the most critical step is defining the active space.
