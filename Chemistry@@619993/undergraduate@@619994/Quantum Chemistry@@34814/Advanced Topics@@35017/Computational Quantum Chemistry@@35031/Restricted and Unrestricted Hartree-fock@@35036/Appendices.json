Two common variants of this method are the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) approaches. In RHF, it is assumed that for every pair of electrons, the spatial orbital for the spin-up electron is identical to the spatial orbital for the spin-down electron. In contrast, the UHF method removes this constraint, allowing the spatial orbitals for spin-up and spin-down electrons to be different.\n\nConsider the ground state of a neutral Helium (He) atom, which has two electrons. A theoretical chemist wants to calculate its electronic energy using both the RHF and UHF methods with the same basis set. Let $E_{RHF}$ be the energy obtained from the RHF calculation and $E_{UHF}$ be the energy from the UHF calculation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between these two energies and provides the most accurate physical reasoning?\n\nA. $E_{UHF} = E_{RHF}$, because for the closed-shell singlet ground state of Helium, the UHF calculation naturally finds that the optimal spatial orbitals for the two electrons are identical, causing the solution to converge to the RHF solution.\n\nB. $E_{UHF} < E_{RHF}$, because the UHF method has more variational freedom by allowing different spatial orbitals for different spins, which always allows it to find a lower energy state.\n\nC. $E_{UHF} > E_{RHF}$, because the added complexity of the UHF method introduces an artifact known as spin contamination, which artificially raises the energy compared to the more constrained RHF method.\n\nD. The relationship cannot be determined without knowing the specific basis set used for the calculation, as the energy ordering can change depending on the quality of the basis set.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the variational structure of Hartree-Fock. Let $S_{RHF}$ denote the set of restricted determinants (same spatial orbital for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ spins) and $S_{UHF}$ the set of unrestricted determinants (different spatial orbitals allowed for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$). Since $S_{RHF} \\subseteq S_{UHF}$, the variational principle immediately gives\n$$\nE_{UHF}^{\\min} \\le E_{RHF}^{\\min}.\n$$\nThus, $E_{UHF}$ cannot be larger than $E_{RHF}$ for the same basis and a properly converged calculation.\n\nFor the helium atom in its closed-shell singlet ground state with two electrons, consider the UHF energy functional with one occupied $\\alpha$ orbital $\\phi_{\\alpha}$ and one occupied $\\beta$ orbital $\\phi_{\\beta}$:\n$$\nE[\\phi_{\\alpha},\\phi_{\\beta}] = \\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\{\\alpha,\\beta\\}} \\langle \\phi_{\\sigma} | \\hat{h} | \\phi_{\\sigma} \\rangle + \\iint \\frac{|\\phi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})|^{2}\\,|\\phi_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})|^{2}}{r_{12}} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}_{2},\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{h}$ is the one-electron Hamiltonian (kinetic energy plus electron–nuclear attraction). There is no exchange term between opposite spins, and within each spin channel the self-Coulomb is exactly canceled by same-spin exchange for the singly occupied orbital, so only the opposite-spin Coulomb interaction remains in the two-electron case.\n\nThe UHF Euler–Lagrange equations can be written as\n$$\n\\left(\\hat{h} + \\hat{J}[|\\phi_{\\beta}|^{2}] \\right)\\phi_{\\alpha} = \\epsilon_{\\alpha}\\,\\phi_{\\alpha},\\qquad\n\\left(\\hat{h} + \\hat{J}[|\\phi_{\\alpha}|^{2}] \\right)\\phi_{\\beta} = \\epsilon_{\\beta}\\,\\phi_{\\beta},\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{J}[\\rho]$ denotes the Coulomb operator generated by the density $\\rho$. At a symmetry-adapted stationary point with $\\phi_{\\alpha}=\\phi_{\\beta}\\equiv \\phi$, both equations reduce to the same one:\n$$\n\\left(\\hat{h} + \\hat{J}[|\\phi|^{2}] \\right)\\phi = \\epsilon\\,\\phi.\n$$\nThis is exactly the RHF orbital equation for a doubly occupied single spatial orbital. In RHF language, the closed-shell Fock operator for a single doubly occupied orbital is $\\hat{F}=\\hat{h}+2\\hat{J}[\\phi]-\\hat{K}[\\phi]$, and since for a single orbital $ \\hat{K}[\\phi]\\phi = \\hat{J}[\\phi]\\phi$, one has $\\hat{F}\\phi=(\\hat{h}+\\hat{J}[\\phi])\\phi$, identical to the UHF equation above when $\\phi_{\\alpha}=\\phi_{\\beta}$. Therefore, the RHF solution is a stationary point of the UHF equations and, for helium, a stable minimum (no spin-symmetry breaking).\n\nCombining this with the variational inclusion $S_{RHF}\\subseteq S_{UHF}$, we obtain\n$$\nE_{UHF} \\le E_{RHF} \\quad\\text{and for He specifically}\\quad E_{UHF} = E_{RHF},\n$$\nbecause the unrestricted minimum occurs at $\\phi_{\\alpha}=\\phi_{\\beta}$, i.e., the UHF solution collapses to the RHF solution for the closed-shell singlet helium atom. This rules out a strict inequality and also rules out any increase in energy due to spin contamination at the minimum, since the minimizing UHF determinant is an eigenfunction of $\\hat{S}^{2}$ when $\\phi_{\\alpha}=\\phi_{\\beta}$.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A is correct: for closed-shell singlet He, UHF converges to the RHF solution, yielding $E_{UHF}=E_{RHF}$.\n- B is incorrect: while $E_{UHF} \\le E_{RHF}$ in general, equality often holds; it is not always strictly lower, and for He it is equal.\n- C is incorrect: spin contamination does not raise the variational minimum above RHF; moreover, at the minimum for He there is no spin contamination and energies are equal.\n- D is incorrect: the inclusion $S_{RHF}\\subseteq S_{UHF}$ holds for any given basis, and for He the unrestricted minimum is the restricted one, so the ordering does not depend on the basis in this case.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1391579"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a stable atom to a dynamic chemical process, we now consider the dissociation of the dinitrogen molecule, $N_2$. This practice [@problem_id:1391561] illustrates a classic and critical scenario where the RHF and UHF methods provide starkly different results.

We wish to model its dissociation into two separate nitrogen atoms by calculating the potential energy as a function of the internuclear distance, $R$. Two common ab-initio quantum chemistry methods are the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) methods. In the RHF method, pairs of electrons with opposite spin are constrained to occupy the same spatial orbital. In the UHF method, this constraint is relaxed, and electrons of opposite spin are allowed to occupy different spatial orbitals.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{RHF}}(R)$ and $E_{\\text{UHF}}(R)$ be the potential energy curves obtained from the RHF and UHF methods, respectively. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate qualitative description of the behavior of these two potential energy curves, particularly in the limit of dissociation ($R \\to \\infty$)?\n\nA. For all internuclear distances $R$, the UHF energy is significantly lower than the RHF energy. Both methods predict that the energy approaches a constant value as $R \\to \\infty$, but the RHF limit is much higher than the correct dissociation energy.\n\nB. For small internuclear distances near the equilibrium bond length, the RHF and UHF energies are nearly identical. As $R$ increases, both curves rise and approach the same energy value, correctly describing the dissociation into two neutral nitrogen atoms.\n\nC. For small internuclear distances near the equilibrium bond length, the RHF and UHF energies are nearly identical. As $R$ increases, both curves rise. However, at large distances, the RHF energy continues to rise to an unphysically high value, while the UHF energy correctly plateaus at the energy corresponding to two separate neutral nitrogen atoms.\n\nD. Both the RHF and UHF methods provide identical potential energy curves for all internuclear distances $R$. They correctly predict the equilibrium bond length but fail to describe dissociation, with the energy increasing without bound as $R \\to \\infty$.\n\nE. The RHF method provides a qualitatively correct potential energy curve, approaching the correct dissociation limit as $R \\to \\infty$. The UHF method fails for this system, predicting a potential energy curve that is unphysically high at all internuclear distances.", "solution": "We compare the qualitative behavior of the potential energy curves $E_{\\text{RHF}}(R)$ and $E_{\\text{UHF}}(R)$ for $N_{2}$ as a function of internuclear distance $R$, especially in the dissociation limit $R \\to \\infty$.\n\nFirst, by construction, RHF enforces the constraint that for each doubly occupied spatial orbital $\\phi_{i}$, the spin-up and spin-down electrons share the same spatial function, i.e., $\\phi_{i}^{\\alpha}=\\phi_{i}^{\\beta}=\\phi_{i}$. UHF relaxes this by allowing $\\phi_{p}^{\\alpha}\\neq \\phi_{q}^{\\beta}$, thereby enlarging the variational space. Consequently, by the variational principle,\n$$\nE_{\\text{UHF}}(R) \\leq E_{\\text{RHF}}(R)\n$$\nfor each fixed $R$, with equality holding when the optimal UHF solution remains spin-restricted (no symmetry breaking). Near the equilibrium bond length $R_{e}$, the singlet closed-shell description is qualitatively appropriate for $N_{2}$, so the UHF solution often coincides with the RHF solution (no spin-symmetry breaking), implying that $E_{\\text{UHF}}(R)\\approx E_{\\text{RHF}}(R)$ near $R_{e}$.\n\nSecond, consider the correct dissociation limit. Physically, as $R \\to \\infty$, the molecule dissociates into two separate nitrogen atoms. Each nitrogen atom has an open-shell high-spin ground state, and the exact molecular dissociation limit is the sum of the exact atomic energies. At the Hartree-Fock level, the qualitatively correct limit is the sum of the HF atomic energies. Because UHF permits different $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ spatial orbitals that can localize on different fragments, the UHF solution can break spin symmetry beyond a Coulson-Fischer point and describe two separated open-shell atoms with opposite overall spin coupling. In the dissociation limit, the interfragment Coulomb and exchange interactions vanish, and the UHF determinants localize, giving\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} E_{\\text{UHF}}(R)=2\\,E_{\\text{HF}}(\\text{N}),\n$$\ni.e., a plateau at the correct Hartree-Fock dissociation limit for two neutral nitrogen atoms.\n\nThird, RHF enforces spin pairing in identical spatial orbitals across all $R$. In the large-$R$ regime this constraint prevents proper localization and forces a delocalized closed-shell description that mixes ionic configurations (schematically, $|\\text{N}^{+}\\text{N}^{-}\\rangle$ and $|\\text{N}^{-}\\text{N}^{+}\\rangle$) with the covalent component. This spurious ionic admixture persists as $R \\to \\infty$, producing an unphysical fractionally spin- and charge-delocalized description and an energy that is too high relative to the correct dissociation limit. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lim_{R \\to \\infty} E_{\\text{RHF}}(R) > 2\\,E_{\\text{HF}}(\\text{N}),\n$$\nand the RHF curve does not properly plateau at the correct limit; instead, beyond the symmetry-breaking point where UHF lowers the energy, the RHF curve remains significantly higher and effectively continues to rise relative to UHF.\n\nCombining these points:\n- Near $R_{e}$: $E_{\\text{UHF}}(R)\\approx E_{\\text{RHF}}(R)$ (often identical if no symmetry breaking).\n- Large $R$: RHF fails qualitatively, remaining too high due to enforced pairing and ionic contamination; UHF correctly plateaus at the energy of two separated neutral nitrogen atoms (within the HF model).\n\nThis matches the qualitative description in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1391561"}, {"introduction": "While the UHF method can correctly describe bond dissociation where RHF fails, the resulting wavefunction must be interpreted with care.
