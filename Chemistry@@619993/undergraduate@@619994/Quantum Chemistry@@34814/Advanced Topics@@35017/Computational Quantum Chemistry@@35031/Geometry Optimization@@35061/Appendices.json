By starting with a highly unstable, hypothetical structure, you are asked to predict the molecule's initial relaxation, helping you build an intuition for how the algorithm translates abstract energy gradients into concrete atomic movements toward stability.", "problem": "In the field of computational quantum chemistry, geometry optimization algorithms are used to find the minimum energy structure of a molecule. Imagine a computational experiment where a geometry optimization is initiated for a single phosphine ($\\text{PH}_3$) molecule, but starting from a non-equilibrium, perfectly trigonal planar geometry. In this initial state, the central phosphorus (P) atom and the three hydrogen (H) atoms all lie in the same plane, and all H-P-H bond angles are exactly $120^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe optimization algorithm will proceed to move the atoms in a way that continuously lowers the total energy of the system until a stable structure (a local minimum on the potential energy surface) is reached. Based on fundamental principles of molecular structure, which of the following statements best describes the initial motion of the atoms as the molecule begins to relax from this planar configuration?\n\nA. The phosphorus atom moves in a direction perpendicular to the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms, causing the H-P-H bond angles to decrease.\nB. The H-P-H bond angles increase from $120$ degrees, and the P-H bond lengths shorten to conserve molecular volume.\nC. The three hydrogen atoms move radially outward away from the phosphorus atom, while the entire molecule remains planar.\nD. One P-H bond shortens significantly while the other two lengthen, leading to an asymmetric C-shaped intermediate.\nE. The P-H bond lengths remain fixed, and the H-P-H bond angles contract, but the molecule remains strictly planar throughout the optimization.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the electron-domain geometry of $\\text{PH}_3$. Phosphorus has $5$ valence electrons. Forming three P–H bonds uses three electron pairs, leaving one lone pair on phosphorus. Thus there are four electron domains around P (three bonding pairs and one lone pair), which by VSEPR principles favor a tetrahedral electron-domain arrangement and a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry. In such a geometry the H–P–H bond angles are less than tetrahedral and, in any case, strictly less than $120^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe given initial structure is perfectly trigonal planar, with all atoms in one plane and H–P–H angles of $120^{\\circ}$; this corresponds to a $D_{3h}$ symmetric configuration. For $\\text{AH}_3$ molecules like $\\text{PH}_3$, Walsh diagram analysis shows that the planar $D_{3h}$ structure is higher in energy than the pyramidal $C_{3v}$ structure, because the lone pair is destabilized in the planar geometry and is stabilized upon pyramidalization through mixing that localizes the lone pair and strengthens bonding. Accordingly, the planar geometry is not a local minimum; it is a first-order saddle point on the potential energy surface.\n\nNear such a saddle point, the steepest-descent direction (the negative-eigenvalue normal mode of the Hessian) corresponds to the umbrella mode that breaks planarity. In symmetry terms, this is the $a_{2}''$ out-of-plane distortion of $D_{3h}$ that lowers the symmetry to $C_{3v}$. Physically, this mode moves the central phosphorus atom perpendicular to the plane defined by the three hydrogens (and, in a mass-weighted sense, the hydrogens undergo a correlated umbrella motion), thereby reducing all H–P–H bond angles from $120^{\\circ}$ toward their pyramidal values. Therefore, as the optimization begins from the planar structure, the immediate motion that lowers energy is the out-of-plane displacement that decreases the H–P–H angles.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A states that P moves perpendicular to the H plane, causing H–P–H angles to decrease. This matches the umbrella mode that leads from $D_{3h}$ planar to $C_{3v}$ pyramidal and is the correct initial relaxation direction.\n- B claims angles increase from $120^{\\circ}$; this contradicts the known pyramidal geometry where angles are less than $120^{\\circ}$, and there is no volume-conservation constraint enforcing P–H bond shortening.\n- C keeps the molecule planar while moving H radially; the planar geometry is unstable specifically to out-of-plane distortion, not to purely radial in-plane expansion.\n- D invokes strong asymmetric bond-length changes; the leading instability from the symmetric planar point is a symmetric umbrella distortion, not a bond-localized asymmetry.\n- E keeps the molecule strictly planar with angle contraction; planar contraction without out-of-plane motion does not achieve the lower-energy pyramidal arrangement and does not follow the unstable normal mode.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the initial motion is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1370824"}, {"introduction": "A successful geometry optimization converges to a \"stationary point\" where the forces on all atoms are zero. However, this mathematical condition alone doesn't guarantee a physically stable molecule; the point could be an energy minimum (a valley) or a saddle point (a mountain pass).

The frequency calculation is needed to compute the Zero-Point Vibrational Energy (ZPVE), which must be added to the electronic energy to find the true lowest-energy geometry.\nB.

For the ammonia molecule, $\\text{NH}_3$, a classic example is the \"umbrella\" inversion, where the nitrogen atom passes through the plane of the three hydrogen atoms, moving from one pyramidal configuration to the other through a planar transition state. To compute the energy barrier for this inversion, one performs a series of constrained geometry optimizations (a \"relaxed scan\"). In each step of the scan, a single geometric parameter is fixed at a specific value, while all other degrees of freedom are allowed to relax to minimize the total energy.\n\nYour task is to identify the most suitable geometric parameter to constrain for mapping this inversion pathway.

Ammonia, $\\text{NH}_{3}$, has $C_{3v}$ symmetry in its pyramidal minima and a planar transition state of $D_{3h}$ symmetry. The inversion proceeds along the totally symmetric out-of-plane (umbrella) normal mode, which preserves $C_{3v}$ equivalence of the three $\\text{N-H}$ bonds along the path and passes through the planar geometry.\n\nFor a relaxed scan that maps the inversion barrier, the most direct and physically meaningful internal coordinate is the one that:\n- Follows the symmetry-adapted umbrella motion (totally symmetric),\n- Connects the two equivalent minima through the planar transition state,\n- Varies a single degree of freedom while allowing all others to relax, and\n- Does not artificially break the $C_{3v}$ symmetry by distinguishing among the three hydrogens.\n\nWe evaluate the options against these criteria:\n- A. Constraining the length of a single $\\text{N-H}$ bond breaks $C_{3v}$ symmetry by distinguishing one hydrogen. It does not directly drive the out-of-plane inversion and couples to bond stretching rather than the umbrella motion.\n- B. Constraining a single $\\text{H-N-H}$ angle also distinguishes two hydrogens and breaks $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Although the umbrella motion changes all three $\\text{H-N-H}$ angles collectively, fixing one specific angle is not symmetry-adapted and can introduce asymmetry into the scan.\n- C. A dihedral of the type $\\text{H-N-H-H}$ necessarily singles out specific hydrogens, breaking $C_{3v}$ symmetry, and can couple to torsional motions around the $C_{3}$ axis. It is also awkward at the planar transition state, where such dihedrals become ambiguous with different hydrogen choices.\n- D. The signed distance of the nitrogen atom from the plane defined by the three hydrogens is exactly the umbrella inversion coordinate. Varying this distance continuously takes the molecule from one pyramidal minimum, through the planar transition state (distance zero), to the opposite minimum, while preserving $C_{3v}$ symmetry and allowing all other coordinates (bond lengths and angles) to relax appropriately.\n- E. The total electronic energy is not a geometric parameter and cannot be used as a constrained internal coordinate for a geometry optimization scan.\n\nTherefore, the correct internal coordinate to constrain for a relaxed scan of the $\\text{NH}_{3}$ umbrella inversion is the distance between the nitrogen atom and the plane of the three hydrogens, which directly parametrizes the inversion coordinate and preserves $C_{3v}$ symmetry throughout the path.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1370862"}]}
