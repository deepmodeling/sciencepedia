The Hamiltonian, while simplified to one-body terms, is a valid model studied in quantum chemistry (e.g., in the context of non-interacting electrons). The coupled cluster formalism presented is standard. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions and constraints to determine a unique solution. The question is specific and the required output is clearly defined.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, mathematical, and free of any subjective or speculative content.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is complete, consistent, realistic within its theoretical model, and directly related to the specified topic of coupled cluster theory. It does not contain any of the listed flaws.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is to express the given Hamiltonian in the second-quantized formalism. The basis for this representation is the set of orthonormal spin-orbitals formed from the eigenfunctions $\\{\\phi_p\\}$ of the one-electron operator $\\hat{h}$. Let $a_p^\\dagger$ and $a_p$ be the creation and annihilation operators for an electron in the spin-orbital corresponding to $\\phi_p$. The Hamiltonian, which is a sum of one-body operators, is written as:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_{p,q} \\langle p|\\hat{h}|q \\rangle a_p^\\dagger a_q\n$$\nSince the basis functions $\\{\\phi_p\\}$ are eigenfunctions of $\\hat{h}$, the matrix elements $\\langle p|\\hat{h}|q \\rangle$ are diagonal:\n$$\n\\langle p|\\hat{h}|q \\rangle = \\int \\phi_p^*(x) \\hat{h}(x) \\phi_q(x) dx = \\epsilon_q \\int \\phi_p^*(x) \\phi_q(x) dx = \\epsilon_p \\delta_{pq}\n$$\nThus, the Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\sum_p \\epsilon_p a_p^\\dagger a_p\n$$\nThe problem states that the reference state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is the single Slater determinant constructed from the $N$ eigenfunctions corresponding to the $N$ lowest eigenvalues. We label the set of occupied spin-orbitals with indices $i, j, k, \\dots$ and the set of unoccupied (virtual) spin-orbitals with indices $a, b, c, \\dots$. The reference state is an eigenfunction of this particular Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\hat{H} |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\left( \\sum_p \\epsilon_p a_p^\\dagger a_p \\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\text{occ}} \\epsilon_i \\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = E_0 |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $E_0 = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{occ}} \\epsilon_i$ is the sum of the energies of the occupied spin-orbitals. This shows that the reference state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is an exact eigenstate of the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$.\n\nThe goal of coupled cluster theory is to find the exact ground-state energy. Since the reference state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is already the exact ground state, the CCSD wave function $|\\Psi\\rangle$ must be equal to $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ (up to a phase factor, which is irrelevant here for the energy).\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle = \\exp(\\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nThis implies that the cluster operator $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$ must be the zero operator. We can formally prove this by solving the CCSD amplitude equations.\n\nThe cluster amplitudes $t_i^a$ and $t_{ij}^{ab}$ are determined by projecting the Schrödinger equation onto the space of singly and doubly excited determinants:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_i^a | e^{-\\hat{T}} \\hat{H} e^{\\hat{T}} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{ij}^{ab} | e^{-\\hat{T}} \\hat{H} e^{\\hat{T}} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 0\n$$\nwhere $|\\Phi_i^a\\rangle = a_a^\\dagger a_i |\\Phi_0\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\\rangle = a_a^\\dagger a_b^\\dagger a_j a_i |\\Phi_0\\rangle$. Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H} = e^{-\\hat{T}}\\hat{H}e^{\\hat{T}}$, the singles amplitude equation is, up to second order in the amplitudes:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_i^a | \\hat{H} + [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_1] + \\dots | \\Phi_0 \\rangle_c = 0\n$$\nThe subscript $c$ indicates that only connected terms are included. For a one-body Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\hat{F}$, the connected terms simplify significantly. The singles equation becomes:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_i^a | \\hat{F} | \\Phi_0 \\rangle_c + \\langle \\Phi_i^a | [\\hat{F}, \\hat{T}_1] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle_c = 0\n$$\nThe first term is $\\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{h} | \\phi_a \\rangle = f_{ia} = 0$, as the basis diagonalizes $\\hat{h}$. This is the statement of Brillouin's theorem.\nThe second term is computed as follows. The single excitation operator is $\\hat{T}_1 = \\sum_{j,b} t_j^b a_b^\\dagger a_j$.\n$$\n[\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_1] = \\left[ \\sum_p \\epsilon_p a_p^\\dagger a_p, \\sum_{j,b} t_j^b a_b^\\dagger a_j \\right] = \\sum_{j,b} (\\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_j) t_j^b a_b^\\dagger a_j\n$$\nProjecting onto $\\langle \\Phi_i^a |$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_i^a | [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_1] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = \\sum_{j,b} (\\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_j) t_j^b \\langle \\Phi_i^a | a_b^\\dagger a_j | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = \\sum_{j,b} (\\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_j) t_j^b \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{ab} = (\\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_i) t_i^a\n$$\nThe singles amplitude equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\epsilon_a - \\epsilon_i) t_i^a = 0\n$$\nSince the occupied orbitals $\\{i\\}$ are the $N$ lowest energy states and the virtual orbitals $\\{a\\}$ are all other states, we have $\\epsilon_a > \\epsilon_i$ (assuming no degeneracy between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals). Therefore, the only solution is $t_i^a = 0$ for all $i,a$. This means $\\hat{T}_1=0$.\n\nSimilarly, the doubles amplitude equation for a one-body Hamiltonian is:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{ij}^{ab} | [\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle_c = 0\n$$\nThe double excitation operator is $\\hat{T}_2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k,l,c,d} t_{kl}^{cd} a_c^\\dagger a_d^\\dagger a_l a_k$. The commutator is:\n$$\n[\\hat{H}, \\hat{T}_2] = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k,l,c,d} (\\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_d - \\epsilon_k - \\epsilon_l) t_{kl}^{cd} a_c^\\dagger a_d^\\dagger a_l a_k\n$$\nProjecting this onto $\\langle \\Phi_{ij}^{ab} |$ yields:\n$$\n(\\epsilon_a + \\epsilon_b - \\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j) t_{ij}^{ab} = 0\n$$\nAs before, since $\\epsilon_{a,b} > \\epsilon_{i,j}$, the prefactor is non-zero (barring accidental degeneracies summing to zero), which forces $t_{ij}^{ab} = 0$ for all $i,j,a,b$. This means $\\hat{T}_2=0$.\n\nWith all singles and doubles amplitudes being zero, $\\hat{T}_1=0$ and $\\hat{T}_2=0$. Now we can evaluate the CCSD energy:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\exp(-0)\\,\\hat{H}\\,\\exp(0) | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{0} \\rangle\n$$\nThis is simply the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for the reference state, which we have already shown to be an eigenvalue equation.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} = \\langle \\Phi_0 | E_0 | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = E_0 \\langle \\Phi_0 | \\Phi_0 \\rangle = E_0\n$$\nThe energy is the sum of the orbital energies of the $N$ electrons occupying the lowest-energy spin-orbitals. The problem denotes the set of occupied eigenvalues as $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$. If we label these $N$ eigenvalues as $\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\dots, \\epsilon_N$, the total energy is their sum.\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CCSD}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\epsilon_i\n$$\nThis result is expected: since the Hartree-Fock reference determinant is the exact ground state for this specific one-body Hamiltonian, any valid many-body method designed to be exact in the full limit, such as coupled cluster theory, must return the exact energy, which is the Hartree-Fock energy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\epsilon_i}\n$$", "id": "2453787"}, {"introduction": "A critical feature of any reliable quantum chemical method is its ability to correctly describe the energy of multiple, non-interacting fragments.

It presents a well-defined theoretical question about the size-extensivity of many-body electronic structure methods. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe central concept in this problem is **size-extensivity**. An electronic structure method is called size-extensive if the energy of a system composed of $N$ non-interacting subsystems is equal to the sum of the energies of the individual subsystems calculated with the same method. For our dimer system of two non-interacting atoms $A$ and $B$, a method is size-extensive if $E_{AB} = E_A + E_B$. The problem states that the atoms are non-interacting for all separations $R$ due to the specified separable Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_A + \\hat{H}_B$.\n\n**Coupled Cluster (CC) Theory**\nThe coupled cluster wavefunction is given by the exponential ansatz, $\\lvert \\Psi_{\\text{CC}} \\rangle = e^{\\hat{T}} \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle$, where $\\hat{T}$ is the cluster operator. For CCSD, $\\hat{T} = \\hat{T}_1 + \\hat{T}_2$. For a system of two non-interacting fragments $A$ and $B$ with localized orbitals, the cluster operator for the combined system is the sum of the cluster operators for the individual fragments: $\\hat{T}_{AB} = \\hat{T}_A + \\hat{T}_B$. Crucially, the operators for different fragments commute, $[\\hat{T}_A, \\hat{T}_B] = 0$.\n\nThe CCSD energy for the dimer is $E_{\\text{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_0 \\rvert \\hat{H}_{AB} e^{\\hat{T}_{AB}} \\rvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle$. Substituting the separable forms:\n$$E_{\\text{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_0^A \\Phi_0^B \\rvert (\\hat{H}_A + \\hat{H}_B) e^{\\hat{T}_A + \\hat{T}_B} \\rvert \\Phi_0^A \\Phi_0^B \\rangle$$\nSince $\\hat{T}_A$ and $\\hat{T}_B$ commute, $e^{\\hat{T}_A + \\hat{T}_B} = e^{\\hat{T}_A} e^{\\hat{T}_B}$.\n$$E_{\\text{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_0^A \\Phi_0^B \\rvert \\hat{H}_A e^{\\hat{T}_A} e^{\\hat{T}_B} \\rvert \\Phi_0^A \\Phi_0^B \\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_0^A \\Phi_0^B \\rvert \\hat{H}_B e^{\\hat{T}_A} e^{\\hat{T}_B} \\rvert \\Phi_0^A \\Phi_0^B \\rangle$$\nOperators for one subsystem act as the identity on the other. Integrating over the coordinates of the other subsystem yields:\n$$E_{\\text{CCSD}}(AB) = \\langle \\Phi_0^A \\rvert \\hat{H}_A e^{\\hat{T}_A} \\rvert \\Phi_0^A \\rangle \\langle \\Phi_0^B \\rvert e^{\\hat{T}_B} \\rvert \\Phi_0^B \\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_0^A \\rvert e^{\\hat{T}_A} \\rvert \\Phi_0^A \\rangle \\langle \\Phi_0^B \\rvert \\hat{H}_B e^{\\hat{T}_B} \\rvert \\Phi_0^B \\rangle$$\nBy the properties of the cluster operator, $\\langle \\Phi_0 \\rvert e^{\\hat{T}} \\rvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle = 1$. The energy expression for a single system is $E_{\\text{CCSD}} = \\langle \\Phi_0 \\rvert \\hat{H} e^{\\hat{T}} \\rvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle$. Therefore, we get:\n$$E_{\\text{CCSD}}(AB) = E_{\\text{CCSD}}(A) \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot E_{\\text{CCSD}}(B) = E_{\\text{CCSD}}(A) + E_{\\text{CCSD}}(B)$$\nThis demonstrates that CCSD is size-extensive. Because this equality holds regardless of the value of $R$ (under the problem's conditions), the calculated CCSD dimer energy is constant and equal to the sum of the monomer energies.\n\n**Configuration Interaction (CI) Theory**\nThe CI wavefunction is a linear expansion of determinants. For CISD, the wavefunction is $\\lvert \\Psi_{\\text{CISD}} \\rangle = c_0 \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle + \\hat{C}_1 \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle + \\hat{C}_2 \\lvert \\Phi_0 \\rangle$, where $\\hat{C}_1$ and $\\hat{C}_2$ are linear operators for single and double excitations.\nThe correct wavefunction for the non-interacting dimer should be the product of the monomer wavefunctions. If we use CISD for the monomers, the ideal dimer wavefunction would be:\n$$\\lvert \\Psi_{A}^{\\text{CISD}} \\rangle \\lvert \\Psi_{B}^{\\text{CISD}} \\rangle = (1+\\hat{C}_{1,A}+\\hat{C}_{2,A})\\lvert \\Phi_0^A \\rangle \\otimes (1+\\hat{C}_{1,B}+\\hat{C}_{2,B})\\lvert \\Phi_0^B \\rangle$$\nExpanding this product gives a wavefunction that includes terms like $\\hat{C}_{2,A} \\hat{C}_{2,B} \\lvert \\Phi_0^{AB} \\rangle$. This term represents a simultaneous double excitation on monomer $A$ and a double excitation on monomer $B$. From the perspective of the dimer, this is a quadruple excitation.\nHowever, a CISD calculation on the dimer $AB$ truncates the expansion at double excitations. It includes single excitations on $A$ (or $B$), double excitations on $A$ (or $B$), and simultaneous single excitations on $A$ and $B$ (which is a double excitation of the dimer). It *excludes* triple and quadruple excitations, such as the $\\hat{C}_{2,A} \\hat{C}_{2,B}$ term.\nBecause the variational space of CISD for the dimer is incomplete (it's missing the product space of higher monomer excitations), the variational principle dictates that the energy will be higher than the energy of the ideal product wavefunction. Thus, for any many-electron system like Argon:\n$$E_{\\text{CISD}}(AB) > E_{\\text{CISD}}(A) + E_{\\text{CISD}}(B)$$\nThis failure to be additive is the size-extensivity error of truncated CI methods. The interaction energy, defined as $\\Delta E = E(AB) - (E(A) + E(B))$, is spurious and positive (repulsive). Since this error is an intrinsic property of the method applied to non-interacting systems, it does not depend on the separation $R$. The CISD dimer energy will be constant for all $R$, but it will be higher than the sum of the monomer energies.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The CCSD dimer energy is exactly independent of $R$ and equal to $E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(A)+E_{\\mathrm{CCSD}}(B)$; the CISD dimer energy is higher (less negative) than $E_{\\mathrm{CISD}}(A)+E_{\\mathrm{CISD}}(B)$, yielding a spurious positive interaction energy even at $R=100\\,\\text{\\AA}$.**\n-   The first part correctly identifies that CCSD is size-extensive, and thus for the given non-interacting system, the energy is additive and independent of $R$.\n-   The second part correctly identifies that CISD is not size-extensive, resulting in a dimer energy that is greater than the sum of monomer energies.

A direct consequence of this condition: $|\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}\\rangle = |\\Psi_{\\text{FCI}}\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle$.\n8.  The task is to determine the value of all cluster amplitudes, $t_{i}^{a}$, $t_{ij}^{ab}$, etc.\n\nValidation verdict: The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded within the framework of quantum chemistry, specifically coupled cluster theory. The premise, while a theoretical limiting case, is well-defined and does not violate any physical or mathematical principles. It is an objective, self-contained problem that admits a unique, rigorous solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe primary condition of the problem is that the coupled cluster wavefunction $|\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}\\rangle$ is identical to the reference state $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the CC ansatz, $|\\Psi_{\\text{CC}}\\rangle = \\exp(T)\\,|\\Phi_0\\rangle$, into this equation, we obtain:\n$$\n\\exp(T)\\,|\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nThe exponential operator $\\exp(T)$ is defined by its Taylor series expansion:\n$$\n\\exp(T) = \\hat{1} + T + \\frac{1}{2!}T^2 + \\frac{1}{3!}T^3 + \\cdots\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{1}$ is the identity operator. Applying this expansion to the reference state yields:\n$$\n\\left(\\hat{1} + T + \\frac{1}{2!}T^2 + \\cdots\\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nThis equation simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\Phi_0\\rangle + T|\\Phi_0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2!}T^2|\\Phi_0\\rangle + \\cdots = |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nSubtracting $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ from both sides gives the central equation to be solved:\n$$\n\\left(T + \\frac{1}{2!}T^2 + \\frac{1}{3!}T^3 + \\cdots\\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis can be written compactly as $(\\exp(T) - \\hat{1})|\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$. The state $(\\exp(T) - \\hat{1})|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is a vector in the many-electron Hilbert space. For this vector to be the zero vector, its components in any basis must all be zero.\n\nThe standard basis for the many-electron Hilbert space (the FCI space) is composed of the reference determinant $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ and all possible excited determinants: the set of singly excited determinants $\\{|\\Phi_i^a\\rangle\\}$, the set of doubly excited determinants $\\{|\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\\rangle\\}$, and so on. These determinants are mutually orthogonal.\n$$\n|\\Phi_i^a\\rangle = a_a^\\dagger a_i |\\Phi_0\\rangle, \\quad |\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\\rangle = a_a^\\dagger a_b^\\dagger a_j a_i |\\Phi_0\\rangle, \\quad \\text{etc.}\n$$\nThe cluster operator $T = T_1 + T_2 + \\dots$ acts on $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ to create a linear combination of excited determinants. Specifically, $T_n$ acting on $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ generates a state within the manifold of $n$-tuply excited determinants. All excited determinants are orthogonal to the reference, $\\langle \\Phi_0 | \\Phi_{i \\dots}^{a \\dots} \\rangle = 0$.\n\nLet us solve the equation $(\\exp(T) - \\hat{1})|\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$ by projecting it onto the manifolds of excited determinants.\n\nStep 1: Projection onto the singly excited manifold.\nWe project the equation onto an arbitrary singly excited determinant $|\\Phi_k^c\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_k^c | \\left(T + \\frac{1}{2}T^2 + \\dots\\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0\n$$\nLet us analyze each term. The first term is $\\langle \\Phi_k^c | T |\\Phi_0\\rangle$. Since $T = T_1 + T_2 + \\dots$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_k^c | T |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_k^c | T_1 |\\Phi_0\\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_k^c | T_2 |\\Phi_0\\rangle + \\cdots\n$$\nThe operator $T_n$ generates $n$-tuply excited states. Due to the orthogonality of the different excitation manifolds, $\\langle \\Phi_k^c | T_n |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$ for all $n \\ne 1$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_k^c | T |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_k^c | T_1 |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_k^c | \\sum_{i,a} t_i^a |\\Phi_i^a\\rangle = t_k^c\n$$\nNow consider the higher-order terms, $\\langle \\Phi_k^c | T^m |\\Phi_0\\rangle$ for $m \\ge 2$. The operator $T$ maps $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ into the space of excited states. Acting with $T$ again, $T(T|\\Phi_0\\rangle)$, will generate states with at least two excitations relative to $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$. For example, $T_1(T_1|\\Phi_0\\rangle)$ produces doubly excited determinants. More generally, $T^m|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ for $m \\ge 2$ is a state that is a linear combination of determinants with two or more excitations. Such a state is orthogonal to any singly excited determinant $|\\Phi_k^c\\rangle$. Thus, $\\langle \\Phi_k^c | T^m |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nThe projection equation for the singles manifold therefore reduces to:\n$$\nt_k^c = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for all occupied indices $k$ and virtual indices $c$, we conclude that all single excitation amplitudes are zero, which implies the operator $T_1=0$.\n\nStep 2: Projection onto the doubly excited manifold.\nNow we project the equation $(\\exp(T) - \\hat{1})|\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$ onto an arbitrary doubly excited determinant $|\\Phi_{kl}^{cd}\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{kl}^{cd} | \\left(T + \\frac{1}{2}T^2 + \\dots\\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0\n$$\nWe have already established that $T_1=0$. Therefore, the cluster operator is now $T = T_2 + T_3 + \\dots$.\nLet's analyze the terms again with this new information. The first term is:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{kl}^{cd} | T |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{kl}^{cd} | (T_2 + T_3 + \\dots) |\\Phi_0\\rangle\n$$\nBy orthogonality, only the $T_2$ component contributes:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{kl}^{cd} | T_2 |\\Phi_0\\rangle = t_{kl}^{cd}\n$$\nNow, consider the higher-order terms $\\langle \\Phi_{kl}^{cd} | T^m |\\Phi_0\\rangle$ for $m \\ge 2$. Since the lowest-level excitation operator remaining in $T$ is $T_2$, the operator $T^m$ will generate states with at least $2m$ excitations. For $m \\ge 2$, the number of excitations is at least $4$. Any state with $4$ or more excitations is orthogonal to any doubly excited determinant. Therefore, $\\langle \\Phi_{kl}^{cd} | T^m |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$ for all $m \\ge 2$.\nThe projection equation for the doubles manifold becomes:\n$$\nt_{kl}^{cd} = 0\n$$\nThis must hold for all $k,l,c,d$, so all double excitation amplitudes are zero, which implies $T_2=0$.\n\nGeneralization by Induction.\nWe can generalize this procedure. Assume we have proven that $T_1 = T_2 = \\dots = T_{n-1} = 0$. To find the amplitudes of $T_n$, we project the equation $(\\exp(T) - \\hat{1})|\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0$ onto an arbitrary $n$-tuply excited determinant $|\\Phi_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n}\\rangle$.\nThe cluster operator under the assumption is $T = T_n + T_{n+1} + \\dots$.\nThe projection is:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n} | \\left(T + \\frac{1}{2}T^2 + \\dots\\right) |\\Phi_0\\rangle = 0\n$$\nThe first term gives the amplitude $t_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Phi_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n} | T |\\Phi_0\\rangle = \\langle \\Phi_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n} | T_n |\\Phi_0\\rangle = t_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n}\n$$\nFor the higher-order terms $\\langle \\Phi_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n} | T^m |\\Phi_0\\rangle$ with $m \\ge 2$, the operator $T^m$ creates states with at least $nm$ excitations. For $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 2$, we have $nm > n$. Thus, the state $T^m|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is orthogonal to the $n$-tuply excited manifold. All higher-order terms in the projection are zero.\nThe projection equation reduces to:\n$$\nt_{i_1 \\dots i_n}^{a_1 \\dots a_n} = 0\n$$\nThis inductive step proves that all cluster amplitudes at all excitation levels must be zero. Intuitively, if the correlated wavefunction is the same as the reference wavefunction, there are no electronic correlation effects to describe, and thus the correlation operator $T$ must be the zero operator.\n\nThe common value taken by any cluster amplitude ($t_{i}^{a}$, $t_{ij}^{ab}$, etc.) under these conditions is therefore $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2453845"}]}
