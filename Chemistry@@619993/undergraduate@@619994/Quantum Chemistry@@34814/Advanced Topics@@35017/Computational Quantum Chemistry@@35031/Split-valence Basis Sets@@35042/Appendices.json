The Pople-style basis sets, like $6\\text{-}31\\text{G}$, offer a systematic way to construct these sets.

A computational study is planned using the $6\\text{-}31\\text{G}$ basis set. To begin estimating the resources needed, you must first determine the total number of contracted basis functions for the entire molecule.\n\nThe rules for interpreting the $6\\text{-}31\\text{G}$ basis set are as follows:\n*   For any second-row atom (from Lithium to Neon), the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted basis function. The valence shell (containing 2s and 2p orbitals) is represented by two sets of functions: an \"inner\" set and an \"outer\" set. The inner set consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions. The outer set also consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions.\n*   For a Hydrogen atom, its 1s valence orbital is represented by two separate s-type contracted functions.\n*   Note that a \"set of p-type functions\" always includes three distinct functions: $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$.\n\nCalculate the total number of contracted basis functions for one molecule of formaldehyde ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$) using the $6\\text{-}31\\text{G}$ basis set.", "solution": "We identify the atoms in formaldehyde $\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$: one carbon (C), two hydrogens (H), and one oxygen (O).

The core contributes $1$ s-type function. Each valence set consists of one s-type function and one set of p-type functions, and each p-set contains $3$ functions ($p_{x}$, $p_{y}$, $p_{z}$).

This thought experiment tackles a common point of confusion by comparing calculations on hydrogen ($\\text{H}_2$) and its heavier isotope, deuterium ($\\text{D}_2$) [@problem_id:1398967]. By explaining why a standard calculation yields the same electronic energy for both, you will connect the practical use of basis sets to the theoretical bedrock of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, clarifying the distinction between electronic energy and total molecular energy.", "problem": "An undergraduate student, Alex, is performing a series of *ab initio* quantum chemistry calculations on hydrogen and its heavier isotope, deuterium. Alex computes the ground-state electronic energy of a single dihydrogen molecule ($\\text{H}_2$) at a fixed internuclear distance of $R = 0.741$ ångström using the 6-31G basis set. Next, Alex performs the exact same calculation for a single dideuterium molecule ($\\text{D}_2$) at the same internuclear distance $R$, using the same 6-31G basis set and level of theory. To Alex's surprise, the electronic energy obtained for $\\text{D}_2$ is identical to the electronic energy obtained for $\\text{H}_2$. Alex knows from spectroscopy that $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{D}_2$ have different bond dissociation energies and vibrational frequencies, and thus expected the calculation to yield different energies.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the electronic energies calculated for $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{D}_2$ are identical in this computational setup?\n\nA. The 6-31G basis set is a relatively small basis set and lacks the flexibility (e.g., polarization and diffuse functions) required to distinguish between isotopes. A much larger basis set, such as aug-cc-pVQZ, would show a difference in the electronic energies.\n\nB. The electronic Schrödinger equation, as solved in standard quantum chemistry calculations under the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, depends only on the positions and charges of the nuclei, not their masses. The basis set is used to describe the behavior of the electrons for this fixed nuclear framework.\n\nC. The student's observation is incorrect and likely due to a software error. The difference in nuclear mass leads to a different reduced mass for the molecule, which must alter the electronic wavefunction and therefore the electronic energy, even if the effect is small.\n\nD. The Gaussian functions in the 6-31G basis set are centered on the nuclear positions. Since the mass of deuterium is different from hydrogen, the center of mass of the nucleus is slightly shifted, causing an artifact that coincidentally cancels the expected energy difference.\n\nE. The identity of the calculated energies is an artifact of neglecting the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE). The total energy, which is the sum of the electronic and vibrational energies, would be different, and modern electronic structure theory is only designed to be accurate for this total energy, not the electronic part alone.", "solution": "We identify the core theoretical framework: in standard quantum chemistry for a fixed nuclear geometry, the electronic energy is obtained by solving the clamped-nuclei (Born-Oppenheimer) electronic Schrödinger equation. The total molecular Hamiltonian can be written as\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\hat{T}_{n} + \\hat{H}_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}; \\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}),\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{T}_{n}$ is the nuclear kinetic energy operator and $\\hat{H}_{e}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian with nuclei treated as fixed point charges at positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$. Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, one first solves the electronic eigenproblem\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}; \\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\Psi_{e} = E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\Psi_{e}.\n$$\nThe explicit form of the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian is\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{e} = \\sum_{i}^{N_{e}} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m_{e}} \\nabla_{i}^{2} \\right)\n- \\sum_{i,A} \\frac{Z_{A} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{R}_{A}|}\n+ \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{r}_{i} - \\mathbf{r}_{j}|}\n+ \\sum_{A<B} \\frac{Z_{A} Z_{B} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} |\\mathbf{R}_{A} - \\mathbf{R}_{B}|}.\n$$\nCrucially, $\\hat{H}_{e}$ depends on the electron mass $m_{e}$, the nuclear charges $Z_{A}$, and the nuclear positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$, but it does not contain the nuclear masses $M_{A}$. The nuclear masses $M_{A}$ appear only in the nuclear kinetic operator\n$$\n\\hat{T}_{n} = - \\sum_{A} \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 M_{A}} \\nabla_{A}^{2},\n$$\nwhich is not part of the clamped-nuclei electronic problem.\n\nFor $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{D}_2$ at the same internuclear distance $R$, we have identical nuclear charges ($Z_{A}=1$ for both isotopes) and identical nuclear positions $\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}$. Therefore, the operator $\\hat{H}_{e}$ is identical for $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{D}_2$. Since the operator is identical, the electronic eigenvalues $E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\})$ are identical for both species when computed at the same geometry and level of theory. A basis set, such as 6-31G, provides an approximate representation of $\\Psi_{e}$ for this fixed nuclear framework; it does not introduce nuclear-mass dependence into $\\hat{H}_{e}$ and hence cannot create an isotope dependence in $E_{e}$ at fixed geometry. Enlarging the basis (for example, to aug-cc-pVQZ) improves the approximation to the same mass-independent eigenvalue and does not break the equality between isotopologues.\n\nThe observed spectroscopic differences (vibrational frequencies and bond dissociation energies including zero-point vibrational energy) arise when solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation on the electronic potential energy surface $E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\})$, where\n$$\n\\hat{T}_{n} \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) + E_{e}(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}) = E_{\\text{tot}} \\chi(\\{\\mathbf{R}_{A}\\}).\n$$\nFor a diatomic molecule, the vibrational level spacings and zero-point energies depend on the reduced mass\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{M_{1} M_{2}}{M_{1} + M_{2}},\n$$\nwhich differs for $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{D}_2$. Hence vibrational frequencies and total energies including zero-point vibrational energy differ, even though the clamped-nuclei electronic energy $E_{e}$ at a fixed $R$ is the same.\n\nBeyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, there are small corrections such as the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) and mass-polarization terms that introduce a dependence on $M_{A}^{-1}$ into an effective electronic energy. However, standard electronic structure calculations that report the electronic energy at a fixed geometry typically do not include these terms by default, and even if included, they are small corrections; the fundamental mass-independence of $\\hat{H}_{e}$ within the clamped-nuclei framework remains the primary reason for the equality observed here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the electronic energy depends only on nuclear charges and positions, not on nuclear masses. This matches option B. Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect for the following reasons:\n- A is incorrect because basis set size does not introduce nuclear-mass dependence into the clamped-nuclei electronic Hamiltonian; a larger basis would not change the equality across isotopologues at fixed geometry.\n- C is incorrect because, within the standard BO electronic problem, nuclear mass does not alter the electronic wavefunction or energy; any mass dependence arises only beyond BO and is not the default in typical calculations.\n- D is incorrect because Gaussian basis functions are centered on nuclear positions, which are the same; the nuclear center of mass is irrelevant to $\\hat{H}_{e}$ at fixed geometry.\n- E is incorrect as a cause of identical electronic energies: zero-point vibrational energy is a nuclear motion contribution added to $E_{e}$; neglecting it cannot explain the equality of $E_{e}$ itself, and modern electronic structure theory is explicitly designed to compute $E_{e}$ accurately.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1398967"}, {"introduction": "The design of a split-valence basis set embodies a chemical intuition: core and valence electrons behave differently and require different levels of descriptive flexibility.
