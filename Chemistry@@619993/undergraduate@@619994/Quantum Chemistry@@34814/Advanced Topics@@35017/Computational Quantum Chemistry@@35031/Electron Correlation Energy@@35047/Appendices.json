The analysis must be conducted under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, using the nonrelativistic electronic Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe correlation energy is defined by the given relation:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{c}}(R) \\equiv E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R) - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(R)\n$$\nHere, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R)$ represents the exact nonrelativistic ground-state electronic energy, and $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(R)$ represents the ground-state energy obtained from the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. Both quantities are to be considered at the complete basis set limit.\n\nLet us first examine the system in question. The molecular ion $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ is composed of two protons and a single electron. This is a one-electron system.\n\nThe exact nonrelativistic electronic energy, $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R)$, is the lowest eigenvalue of the electronic Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{el}} \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}; R) = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R) \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}; R)\n$$\nwhere $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}; R)$ is the electronic wavefunction and $\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{el}}$ is the electronic Hamiltonian. For $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$, with the two nuclei labeled $A$ and $B$ located at positions $\\mathbf{R}_A$ and $\\mathbf{R}_B$ respectively, and the electron at position $\\mathbf{r}$, the Hamiltonian in atomic units is:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{el}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_A|} - \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_B|}\n$$\nThe nuclear-nuclear repulsion term, $\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{R}_A - \\mathbf{R}_B|} = \\frac{1}{R}$, is a constant for a fixed internuclear distance $R$ and is typically added to the electronic energy to obtain the total energy. Since it would be added to both $E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(R)$, it cancels in their difference and can be disregarded for the calculation of $E_{\\mathrm{c}}(R)$.\n\nNow, let us analyze the Hartree-Fock energy, $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(R)$. The Hartree-Fock method is an approximation for many-electron systems. It approximates the N-electron wavefunction as a single Slater determinant of one-electron orbitals, $|\\phi_i\\rangle$. The central approximation is that each electron moves independently in a mean field generated by the other $N-1$ electrons.\n\nThe orbitals $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ and their corresponding energies $\\epsilon_i$ are solutions to the canonical Hartree-Fock equations:\n$$\n\\hat{F}|\\phi_i\\rangle = \\epsilon_i |\\phi_i\\rangle\n$$\nThe Fock operator, $\\hat{F}$, for a general N-electron system is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{F}(1) = \\hat{h}(1) + \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( \\hat{J}_j(1) - \\hat{K}_j(1) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{h}(1)$ is the one-electron core Hamiltonian (kinetic energy and nuclear attraction), $\\hat{J}_j$ is the Coulomb operator representing the average electrostatic repulsion from an electron in orbital $\\phi_j$, and $\\hat{K}_j$ is the exchange operator, which has no classical analogue and arises from the antisymmetry requirement of the electronic wavefunction.\n\nThe concept of electron correlation arises precisely because the Hartree-Fock method replaces instantaneous electron-electron interactions with an averaged, or mean-field, interaction. The correlation energy is the correction required to account for the detailed, correlated motion of electrons, which is neglected in the HF approximation.\n\nWe now apply this framework to the $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ ion. For this system, the number of electrons is $N=1$. With $N=1$, the summation in the Fock operator runs from $j=1$ to $1$, but typically the sum is over all other electrons, or the self-interaction term ($j=i$) cancels out perfectly, i.e., $(\\hat{J}_i - \\hat{K}_i)|\\phi_i\\rangle = 0$. In a one-electron system, there are no \"other\" electrons. The sum over $j$ is empty. Consequently, there are no electron-electron repulsion terms, and thus the Coulomb and exchange operators, $\\hat{J}$ and $\\hat{K}$, do not exist.\n\nThe Fock operator for the $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ system simplifies exactly to the core Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\hat{F} = \\hat{h}(1)\n$$\nThe core Hamiltonian for the single electron in $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{h}(1) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_A|} - \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_B|}\n$$\nThis is identical to the exact electronic Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{el}}$, for the $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ system.\n\nTherefore, for a one-electron system, the Hartree-Fock equation $\\hat{F}|\\phi\\rangle = \\epsilon|\\phi\\rangle$ becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{el}}|\\phi\\rangle = \\epsilon|\\phi\\rangle\n$$\nThis is precisely the exact electronic Schrödinger equation. This means that for any one-electron system, the Hartree-Fock method is not an approximation but is, in fact, exact. The Hartree-Fock wavefunction is the exact wavefunction, and the Hartree-Fock energy is the exact energy.\n\nGiven that the problem specifies the calculations are performed in the complete basis set limit, there is no error from basis set incompleteness. Thus, the theoretical Hartree-Fock energy is identical to the exact nonrelativistic energy:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{HF}}(R) = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R)\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the definition of correlation energy:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{c}}(R) = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R) - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(R) = E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R) - E_{\\mathrm{exact}}(R) = 0\n$$\nThe correlation energy for the $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ molecular ion is identically zero for all internuclear separations $R$. This is a fundamental consequence of the definition of correlation energy, which quantifies the error of the mean-field approximation for modeling electron-electron interactions. In the absence of such interactions, as in any one-electron system, this error is by definition zero.\n\nThe final answer is exactly $0$.
