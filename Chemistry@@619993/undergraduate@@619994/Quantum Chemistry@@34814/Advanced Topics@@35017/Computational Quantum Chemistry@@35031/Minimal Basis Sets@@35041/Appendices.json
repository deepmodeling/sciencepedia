These atomic orbitals are, in turn, described by a set of mathematical functions known as a basis set. A common type of minimal basis set is the STO-3G basis, where STO stands for Slater-Type Orbital. In a minimal basis set, one basis function is used to represent each atomic orbital required to accommodate all the electrons of the neutral atom in its ground state. This includes both core and valence orbitals.\n\nConsider the formaldehyde molecule, which has the chemical formula $\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nCalculate the total number of basis functions required to describe the formaldehyde molecule using a minimal basis set like STO-3G.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of basis functions for the formaldehyde molecule ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$) when described by a minimal basis set. The problem states that a minimal basis set includes one basis function for each occupied core and valence atomic orbital of a neutral atom in its ground state. The total number of basis functions for the molecule is the sum of the basis functions for each of its constituent atoms. The formaldehyde molecule is composed of one carbon atom (C), two hydrogen atoms (H), and one oxygen atom (O).\n\nFirst, we determine the number of basis functions for a single hydrogen atom (H).\nA neutral hydrogen atom has an atomic number of 1. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^1$. The only occupied atomic orbital is the $1s$ orbital. Therefore, a minimal basis set for a hydrogen atom requires 1 basis function corresponding to the $1s$ orbital.\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions for a single carbon atom (C).\nA neutral carbon atom has an atomic number of 6. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$ (core), $2s$ (valence), and the three $2p$ orbitals ($2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$) (valence). Even though only two electrons are in the $2p$ subshell, all three $p$-orbitals are included to allow for proper bonding description. The set of atomic orbitals is $\\{1s, 2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z\\}$. Counting these orbitals gives a total of $1 + 1 + 3 = 5$ basis functions for a carbon atom.\n\nThen, we determine the number of basis functions for a single oxygen atom (O).\nA neutral oxygen atom has an atomic number of 8. Its ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$. Similar to carbon, the occupied atomic orbitals are the $1s$ (core), $2s$ (valence), and the three $2p$ orbitals ($2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$) (valence). The set of atomic orbitals is $\\{1s, 2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z\\}$. This gives a total of $1 + 1 + 3 = 5$ basis functions for an oxygen atom.\n\nFinally, we sum the number of basis functions for all atoms in the formaldehyde molecule ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$).\nThe molecule consists of:\n- One carbon atom, which contributes 5 basis functions.\n- Two hydrogen atoms, each contributing 1 basis function, for a total of $2 \\times 1 = 2$ basis functions.\n- One oxygen atom, which contributes 5 basis functions.\n\nThe total number of basis functions is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\text{Total basis functions} = (\\text{functions for C}) + 2 \\times (\\text{functions for H}) + (\\text{functions for O}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total basis functions} = 5 + 2 \\times 1 + 5 = 12 $$\nTherefore, a minimal basis set description of the formaldehyde molecule requires 12 basis functions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "1380727"}, {"introduction": "A crucial, and sometimes non-intuitive, rule in basis set theory is that the set of functions for an element is determined by its neutral atomic configuration, regardless of its charge state in a molecule.
