The general formula for a system with $N$ electrons is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i} n_{i} |\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n$$\nIn this equation, the sum is over all Kohn-Sham spatial orbitals $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})$. The term $n_i$ represents the occupation number of the $i$-th orbital, and $|\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ is the probability density associated with that orbital at a point in space $\\mathbf{r}$. Note that $|\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ is equivalent to $\\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})$, which is important if the orbitals are complex-valued.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the system has four electrons, and these electrons occupy only two spatial orbitals: $\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r})$. All other orbitals are unoccupied. Therefore, the sum will only include terms for $i=1$ and $i=2$.\n\nThe problem specifies that each of these two orbitals is \"doubly occupied.\" This means that each spatial orbital contains two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down (spin-paired). This sets the occupation number for each of these occupied orbitals to 2.\n- For the orbital $\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r})$, the occupation number is $n_1 = 2$.\n- For the orbital $\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r})$, the occupation number is $n_2 = 2$.\n- For all other orbitals $\\phi_i$ where $i > 2$, the occupation number is $n_i = 0$, so they do not contribute to the density.\n\nSubstituting these values into the general formula for the electron density, we get:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = n_1 |\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r})|^2 + n_2 |\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n$$\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = 2 |\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r})|^2 + 2 |\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n$$\n\nThis expression can be written more compactly by factoring out the common occupation number of 2:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = 2 \\left( |\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r})|^2 + |\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r})|^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the total electron density of the system.

Since a one-electron system has no other electrons to interact with, it is inherently a \"non-interacting\" system. Therefore, its true kinetic energy is identical to the Kohn-Sham non-interacting kinetic energy: $T_{true} = T_s[\\rho]$.\n- **External Potential Energy:** The interaction with the external potential (the nucleus) is the same in both the true system and the Kohn-Sham description: $V_{ext, true} = E_{ext}[\\rho]$.\n\nStep 5: Equate the energy expressions and simplify.\nThe true energy of the system is $E_{true} = T_{true} + V_{ext, true}$. Using the equivalences from Step 4, we can write this as $E_{true} = T_s[\\rho] + E_{ext}[\\rho]$.\nNow, we set this equal to the full Kohn-Sham energy expression:\n$$T_s[\\rho] + E_{ext}[\\rho] = T_s[\\rho] + E_{ext}[\\rho] + J[\\rho] + E_{xc}[\\rho]$$\nSubtracting $T_s[\\rho] + E_{ext}[\\rho]$ from both sides reveals a crucial constraint on the remaining terms:\n$$0 = J[\\rho] + E_{xc}[\\rho]$$\nThis means that for a one-electron system, the exact exchange-correlation energy must be precisely the negative of the Hartree energy:\n$$E_{xc}[\\rho] = -J[\\rho]$$\nThis is an exact condition. The Hartree energy $J[\\rho]$ represents the spurious self-interaction of the electron's charge density with itself, which is not present in the true quantum mechanical description of a single electron. The exchange-correlation energy $E_{xc}[\\rho]$ must therefore exactly cancel this non-physical self-interaction term.\n\nStep 6: Relate the energy functionals to their corresponding potentials.\nThe Hartree potential $v_H(\\mathbf{r})$ and the exchange-correlation potential $v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r})$ are defined as the functional derivatives of their respective energy functionals with respect to the electron density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$v_H(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\delta J[\\rho]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}$$\n$$v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\delta E_{xc}[\\rho]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nTaking the functional derivative of the relationship $E_{xc}[\\rho] = -J[\\rho]$ with respect to $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ gives:\n$$\\frac{\\delta E_{xc}[\\rho]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})} = -\\frac{\\delta J[\\rho]}{\\delta \\rho(\\mathbf{r})}$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the potentials, we arrive at the final relationship:\n$$v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r}) = -v_H(\\mathbf{r})$$\n\nThis result shows that for a one-electron system, the exchange-correlation potential must exactly cancel the Hartree potential (the self-interaction potential). This ensures that the total Kohn-Sham effective potential, $v_{KS}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{ext}(\\mathbf{r}) + v_H(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r})$, simplifies to $v_{KS}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{ext}(\\mathbf{r})$.
