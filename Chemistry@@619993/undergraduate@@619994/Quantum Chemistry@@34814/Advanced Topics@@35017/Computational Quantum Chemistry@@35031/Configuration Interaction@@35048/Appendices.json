First, the variational principle states that for any normalized trial state $\\lvert \\Psi \\rangle$, the expectation value $\\langle \\Psi | \\hat{H} | \\Psi \\rangle$ is an upper bound to the exact ground-state energy $E_{0}$. Second, the Hartree–Fock (HF) procedure determines orbitals by making the energy stationary with respect to orbital rotations; in canonical HF orbitals, this yields Brillouin’s theorem, which for a closed-shell non-degenerate HF solution implies $\\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle = 0$ for all single excitations $\\lvert \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle$.\n\nConsider the Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS) subspace $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle, \\lvert \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle\\}$. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ within this subspace include the couplings $\\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle$. By Brillouin’s theorem, these couplings vanish for a closed-shell HF reference, so the Hamiltonian in $\\mathcal{S}$ takes a block form in which $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ decouples from all $\\lvert \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle$. As a consequence, upon diagonalization of $\\hat{H}$ in $\\mathcal{S}$, one eigenpair is identically the HF ground state with eigenvalue $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$. Therefore, the CIS ground-state energy $E_{\\mathrm{CIS,g}}$ equals $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$, and the ground-state correlation energy recovered by CIS, defined as $E_{\\mathrm{corr}}^{\\mathrm{CIS}} = E_{\\mathrm{CIS,g}} - E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$, is $0$. True ground-state correlation arises primarily through mixing with double and higher excitations, such as $\\lvert \\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \\rangle$, which do couple to $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$ and are absent in CIS. Hence, CIS is a poor method for ground-state correlation energy.\n\nFor excited states, the situation differs. Many low-lying valence excitations have dominant single-excitation character relative to the HF ground state, meaning that their exact wave functions have large components along $\\{ \\lvert \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle \\}$. Projecting the Schrödinger equation onto the singles subspace and diagonalizing yields approximate excited-state energies that are the best (in the variational sense restricted to $\\mathcal{S}$) within the singles manifold. Although the variational principle strictly provides an upper bound only for the lowest state of a given symmetry in the chosen subspace, the CIS eigenvalues often approximate one-electron promotions reasonably because the leading physics of these excitations is captured by mixing among $\\lvert \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle$ determinants. Missing double excitations in CIS cause substantial errors for states with significant double-excitation character and contribute second-order corrections even for predominantly single-excitation states, but the leading-order description for many excitations is nevertheless reasonable.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA) This option correctly invokes Brillouin’s theorem: for a canonical HF reference, $\\langle \\Phi_{0} | \\hat{H} | \\Phi_{i}^{a} \\rangle = 0$, so CIS cannot lower the ground-state energy below $E_{\\mathrm{HF}}$, capturing $0$ ground-state correlation energy. It also correctly states that many low-lying excited states are predominantly single excitations, so diagonalization within the singles space provides a reasonable first approximation to their energies. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB) This option mischaracterizes CIS for the ground state. CIS does not overestimate the correlation energy; rather, for a closed-shell non-degenerate HF reference it recovers $0$ ground-state correlation energy because singles do not couple to $\\lvert \\Phi_{0} \\rangle$. The dynamic versus static correlation dichotomy does not justify the stated behavior. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC) This option incorrectly claims CIS is size-consistent and that it recovers most ground-state correlation energy. CIS is not size-consistent and, as shown, captures $0$ ground-state correlation for a closed-shell HF reference. It also incorrectly suggests that excited states generally require double excitations; many do not and are well described at the single-excitation level. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD) While CIS indeed lacks explicit orbital relaxation, this limitation does not make ground and excited states similarly inaccurate; the distinctive failure for the ground state arises from the vanishing singles coupling. Moreover, the success of CIS for many excitations is not coincidental but reflects the single-excitation character of those states. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE) The variational principle does not guarantee exact excited-state energies, and it provides an upper bound only for the lowest state of a given symmetry within the chosen subspace, not the exact excited spectrum. Furthermore, spin contamination is not the cause of CIS’s ground-state failure; spin-adapted formulations avoid this issue, and the key point remains Brillouin’s theorem.
