This is equivalent to comparing the cation energies $E^{\\mathrm{HF,frozen}}_{N-1}$ and $E^{\\mathrm{HF}}_{N-1}$, since $E^{\\mathrm{HF}}_{N}$ is common to both definitions.\n\nAccording to the variational principle, the Hartree–Fock energy obtained from any trial wavefunction (represented by a Slater determinant of a set of orbitals) is an upper bound to the true HF ground-state energy.\n- $E^{\\mathrm{HF}}_{N-1}$ is the true HF ground-state energy for the cation, obtained using the variationally optimal orbitals for the $N-1$ electron system.\n- $E^{\\mathrm{HF,frozen}}_{N-1}$ is the HF energy for the cation calculated using a non-optimal set of orbitals (the orbitals from the neutral atom).\n\nTherefore, the variationally optimized energy must be lower than or equal to the energy from the non-optimal, frozen orbitals:\n$$E^{\\mathrm{HF}}_{N-1} \\le E^{\\mathrm{HF,frozen}}_{N-1}$$\nWhen an electron is removed from the $\\text{Li}$ atom, the electron-electron repulsion changes.

The reasoning must be based on the differential effects of orbital relaxation and electron correlation, particularly how orbital localization versus delocalization influences the magnitude of relaxation.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The vertical ionization potential, $I_{k}$, for removing an electron from orbital $k$ is rigorously defined as the difference in total energies between the final $(N-1)$-electron cationic state and the initial $N$-electron neutral ground state:\n$$I_{k} = E_{k}^{N-1} - E^{N}$$\nwhere both energies are calculated at the fixed geometry of the neutral molecule.\n\nKoopmans' theorem provides an approximation to $I_{k}$ within the Hartree-Fock framework. It states that the ionization potential is approximately equal to the negative of the canonical HF orbital energy, $\\epsilon_{k}$:\n$$I_{k} \\approx -\\epsilon_{k}$$\nThis approximation relies on two main assumptions:\n1.  **Frozen Orbitals**: The orbitals of the cation ($E_{k}^{N-1}$) are assumed to be identical to the orbitals of the neutral molecule ($E^{N}$).\n2.  **Neglect of Correlation Energy Difference**: The difference in electron correlation energy between the $N$-electron and $(N-1)$-electron states is ignored.\n\nDeviations from Koopmans' theorem arise because these assumptions are not strictly valid. The exact ionization potential can be expressed by correcting the Koopmans' value:\n$$I_{k} = -\\epsilon_{k} - E_{\\text{relax}, k} + \\Delta E_{\\text{corr}, k}$$\nHere, $E_{\\text{relax}, k}$ is the orbital relaxation energy. Upon electron removal, the remaining electrons experience a less-screened nuclear charge, causing their orbitals to contract and reorganize. This relaxation always lowers the energy of the cation, meaning $E_{\\text{relax}, k}$ is a positive quantity that reduces the ionization potential relative to the Koopmans' prediction. $\\Delta E_{\\text{corr}, k}$ is the difference in correlation energy between the neutral and cationic states. Since the $N$-electron system typically has a larger magnitude of correlation energy than the $(N-1)$-electron system, this term usually increases the ionization potential.\n\nThe problem asks to focus on the effect of orbital relaxation, which is strongly dependent on the spatial character of the orbital from which the electron is removed.\n-   Removal of an electron from a **spatially localized** orbital (e.g., a lone pair) creates a concentrated positive hole. The remaining electrons can reorganize very effectively to screen this charge, leading to a **large** relaxation energy, $E_{\\text{relax}, k}$.\n-   Removal of an electron from a **spatially delocalized** orbital (e.g., a $\\pi$ or $\\sigma$ bonding orbital spread over several atoms) creates a diffuse positive hole. The electronic reorganization is less pronounced, leading to a **small** relaxation energy, $E_{\\text{relax}, k}$.\n\nAn inversion in the ordering of ionization potentials occurs when the Koopmans' prediction is reversed by the correction terms. Consider two orbitals, $i$ and $j$, with an HF ordering $\\epsilon_{j}  \\epsilon_{i}$. Koopmans' theorem predicts $I_{j}  I_{i}$. An inversion means that experimentally, we find $I_{j}  I_{i}$. This is most likely to happen if the differential relaxation energy, $E_{\\text{relax}, i} - E_{\\text{relax}, j}$, is large and positive enough to overcome the initial energy difference, $|\\epsilon_{j} - \\epsilon_{i}|$. This scenario is favored when:\n1.  The initial HF energy gap $|\\epsilon_{j} - \\epsilon_{i}|$ is small.\n2.  The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, orbital $j$) is **delocalized** (small $E_{\\text{relax}, j}$).\n3.  The next-highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-1, orbital $i$) is **localized** (large $E_{\\text{relax}, i}$).\n\nNow, we analyze each molecule based on the provided information.\n\n**A. $\\text{N}_2$**\nThe problem states the HF ordering is $\\epsilon(3\\sigma_{g})  \\epsilon(1\\pi_{u})$. This means the HOMO is $3\\sigma_{g}$ and HOMO-1 is $1\\pi_{u}$.\n-   Koopmans' prediction: $I(3\\sigma_{g})  I(1\\pi_{u})$.\n-   Experimental results for the first two IPs are $I(3\\sigma_{g}) \\approx 15.6 \\, \\text{eV}$ and $I(1\\pi_{u}) \\approx 17.0 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n-   Thus, the experimental ordering is $I(3\\sigma_{g})  I(1\\pi_{u})$. In this case, the ordering predicted by Koopmans' theorem (based on the provided HF energies) **matches** the experimental ordering. No inversion occurs. Therefore, $\\text{N}_2$ is not the correct answer.\n\n**B. CO**\nThe problem states the HF ordering is $\\epsilon(1\\pi)  \\epsilon(5\\sigma)$.\n-   HOMO: $1\\pi$ orbital, which is described as delocalized $\\pi$ bonding. This implies a **small** relaxation energy, $E_{\\text{relax}}(1\\pi)$.\n-   HOMO-1: $5\\sigma$ orbital, described as a carbon-localized $\\sigma$ lone pair. This implies a **large** relaxation energy, $E_{\\text{relax}}(5\\sigma)$.\n-   Koopmans' prediction: $I(1\\pi)  I(5\\sigma)$.\n-   The large differential relaxation, where $E_{\\text{relax}}(5\\sigma) \\gg E_{\\text{relax}}(1\\pi)$, provides a strong mechanism to lower the ionization potential of the $5\\sigma$ state significantly more than that of the $1\\pi$ state. This can be sufficient to overcome the initial HF energy gap and invert the ordering.\n-   Indeed, experimental PES shows that the first (lowest) ionization potential of CO corresponds to the removal of an electron from the $5\\sigma$ orbital ($I(5\\sigma) \\approx 14.0 \\, \\text{eV}$), while the second corresponds to the $1\\pi$ orbital ($I(1\\pi) \\approx 16.9 \\, \\text{eV}$). So, experimentally $I(5\\sigma)  I(1\\pi)$.\n-   This is an inversion relative to the Koopmans' prediction from the given HF ordering ($I(1\\pi)  I(5\\sigma)$). CO perfectly fits the profile of a molecule where a delocalized HOMO and a localized HOMO-1 lead to a failure of Koopmans' theorem due to differential orbital relaxation.\n\n**C. $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$**\nThe HF ordering is given as $\\epsilon(1b_{1})  \\epsilon(3a_{1})$.\n-   HOMO: $1b_{1}$, a nonbonding p-type orbital on oxygen. This is **localized**.\n-   HOMO-1: $3a_{1}$, largely an oxygen lone-pair orbital. This is also **localized**.\n-   Since both the HOMO and HOMO-1 are highly localized on the oxygen atom, the relaxation energies for ionization from both orbitals are expected to be large and of similar magnitude. There is no large differential relaxation effect to cause an inversion. The Koopmans' ordering is experimentally confirmed for water.\n\n**D. $\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4$**\nThe HF ordering is given as $\\epsilon(\\pi)  \\epsilon(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CH}})$.\n-   HOMO: $\\pi$ orbital, which is **delocalized** over the two carbon atoms.\n-   HOMO-1: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ orbitals, which are bonding orbitals more localized in the C-H bond regions.\n-   This case resembles CO in having a delocalized HOMO and a more localized HOMO-1. However, a $\\sigma$ bonding orbital is generally less compact and localized than a non-bonding lone pair orbital like the $5\\sigma$ in CO. Consequently, the differential relaxation energy between the $\\pi$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CH}}$ states in ethylene is expected to be smaller than the differential relaxation between the $1\\pi$ and $5\\sigma$ states in CO. An inversion is therefore less likely. The Koopmans' ordering for ethylene is in fact correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, CO is the molecule where the combination of orbital characteristics (a delocalized HOMO and a highly localized HOMO-1 with a small energy gap) creates the ideal conditions for a large differential orbital relaxation effect, leading to an inversion of the ionization potential ordering compared to the prediction from the given HF orbital energies.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis Summary:**\n- **A. $\\text{N}_2$**: According to the provided data, the HF ordering and the experimental PES ordering are the same.
