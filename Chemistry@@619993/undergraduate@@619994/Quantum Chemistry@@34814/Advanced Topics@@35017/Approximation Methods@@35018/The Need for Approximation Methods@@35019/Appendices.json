This first practice explores why calculating a fundamental chemical property, the electron affinity of a fluorine atom, is an analytically impossible task. By examining the Hamiltonian for this multi-electron system, you will pinpoint the mathematical term that is the ultimate source of this complexity—the heart of the infamous \"many-body problem\" that necessitates the use of approximation methods. [@problem_id:1409108]", "problem": "The electron affinity of an element is a crucial chemical property, defined as the energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom in its gaseous state. Calculating this quantity from first principles for a fluorine atom to form a fluoride ion ($\\text{F}^-$) requires finding the ground state energies of both the 9-electron fluorine atom and the 10-electron fluoride ion using quantum mechanics. The calculation for the fluoride ion involves solving the non-relativistic, time-independent Schrödinger equation for a system consisting of a single nucleus of charge $+Ze$ (with $Z=9$) and $N=10$ electrons, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nucleus is considered stationary.\n\nDespite the well-defined nature of the governing equation and the potential, an exact analytical solution for the energy of the $\\text{F}^-$ ion is impossible to obtain, necessitating the use of sophisticated approximation methods.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the fundamental mathematical reason for this analytical intractability?\n\nA. The Hamiltonian operator includes inter-electronic repulsion terms, which prevent the separation of the Schrödinger equation into independent equations for each electron.\n\nB. The Pauli exclusion principle requires the total electronic wavefunction to be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons, which introduces mathematical constraints that are too complex to solve analytically.\n\nC. Relativistic effects, such as spin-orbit coupling, become significant for atoms with many electrons and are not included in the standard non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, making any non-relativistic solution inherently incomplete and thus unsolvable.\n\nD. The model of a point-like nucleus is an oversimplification; the finite size and complex charge distribution of the fluorine nucleus prevent an exact solution for the electron-nucleus potential.\n\nE. The kinetic energy operator for ten electrons results in a partial differential equation in 30 spatial dimensions, which is inherently too high-dimensional to be solved analytically, regardless of the form of the potential energy.", "solution": "To understand why the Schrödinger equation for the fluoride ion ($\\text{F}^-$) is analytically unsolvable, we must examine the structure of its Hamiltonian operator, $\\hat{H}$. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the nucleus is fixed at the origin. The $\\text{F}^-$ ion has a nucleus with charge $+Ze$ (where $Z=9$ for fluorine) and $N=10$ electrons. The position of the $i$-th electron is given by the vector $\\mathbf{r}_i$, and its mass is $m_e$. The non-relativistic Hamiltonian for this system is the sum of the kinetic energy of all electrons, the potential energy of attraction between each electron and the nucleus, and the potential energy of repulsion between every pair of electrons.\n\nMathematically, the Hamiltonian is expressed as:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla_i^2 \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\left( -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |\\mathbf{r}_i|} \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j>i}^{10} \\left( \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|} \\right) $$\n\nLet's break this down into its three main parts:\n1.  $\\hat{T} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla_i^2 \\right)$: This is the total kinetic energy operator, which is a sum of the individual kinetic energy operators for each of the 10 electrons.\n2.  $\\hat{V}_{ne} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\left( -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |\\mathbf{r}_i|} \\right)$: This is the nucleus-electron attraction potential energy. It is also a sum of terms, where each term depends only on the coordinates of a single electron, $\\mathbf{r}_i$.\n3.  $\\hat{V}_{ee} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j>i}^{10} \\left( \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|} \\right)$: This is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy. This term is the source of the difficulty. Each term in this double summation depends on the coordinates of *two* different electrons, $\\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\\mathbf{r}_j$, specifically on the distance between them, $|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|$.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation we need to solve is $\\hat{H}\\Psi = E\\Psi$, where $\\Psi$ is the total electronic wavefunction, $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{r}_{10})$. A common method for solving such multi-dimensional partial differential equations is the separation of variables. This method would work if the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ could be written as a sum of one-electron operators, i.e., $\\hat{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\hat{h}_i$, where each $\\hat{h}_i$ depends only on the coordinates of the $i$-th electron.\n\nIf we were to ignore the electron-electron repulsion term $\\hat{V}_{ee}$, the Hamiltonian would be $\\hat{H}' = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}_{ne} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla_i^2 - \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |\\mathbf{r}_i|} \\right)$. This simplified Hamiltonian *is* separable, as it is a sum of 10 identical one-electron operators. The solution would be a product of hydrogen-like atomic orbitals.\n\nHowever, the actual Hamiltonian for $\\text{F}^-$ includes the $\\hat{V}_{ee}$ term. This term \"couples\" the motion of all the electrons. The position of electron $i$ directly influences the potential energy experienced by electron $j$, and vice-versa. Because of this coupling term, the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ cannot be separated into a sum of independent one-electron operators. This non-separability of the variables in the partial differential equation is the fundamental mathematical barrier that prevents us from finding an exact, analytical, closed-form solution.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options:\n- **A** correctly identifies that the inter-electronic repulsion terms couple the electron coordinates and prevent the separation of the Schrödinger equation. This is the core reason for the analytical intractability.\n- **B** is incorrect. The Pauli exclusion principle is a fundamental postulate that dictates the symmetry properties of the wavefunction for fermions. While it is essential for constructing a physically correct approximate solution (e.g., using a Slater determinant), it is not the reason the underlying differential equation itself is unsolvable. The problem of non-separability exists even if electrons were bosons.\n- **C** is incorrect. Relativistic effects are corrections to the non-relativistic model. The problem of analytical unsolvability exists firmly within the simpler non-relativistic framework itself. Omitting these effects does not make the problem solvable.\n- **D** is incorrect. Treating the nucleus as a point charge is an approximation (part of the Born-Oppenheimer model). While a more realistic nuclear model would be more accurate, the fundamental problem of electron-electron repulsion and non-separability would remain. The point-nucleus model is already unsolvable.\n- **E** is incorrect. The high dimensionality is a challenge, but not the root cause. A 30-dimensional PDE can be solved analytically if its operator is separable. It is the *coupling* of these dimensions by the electron-electron repulsion potential that makes it unsolvable, not the dimensionality itself.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason is the electron-electron repulsion term that makes the Hamiltonian operator non-separable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1409108"}, {"introduction": "While the presence of multiple interacting particles is a primary reason for analytical intractability, it is not the only one.

The attractive nature of the impurity potential ($V_0 > 0$) fundamentally alters the form of the kinetic energy operator in the Hamiltonian.\n\nC. The boundary condition that the wavefunction is zero at $r=R$ is violated by the presence of the singular potential from the impurity.\n\nD. The impurity potential breaks the spherical symmetry of the system, coupling the radial and angular parts of the Schrödinger equation and thus preventing a solution by separation of variables.\n\nE.
