This exercise [@problem_id:1422368] demonstrates a core principle: how adding an electron can alter a molecule's preferred geometry. By analyzing the energy trend of the orbital that the new electron occupies, we can predict whether the molecule will bend more or straighten out to achieve its most stable energetic state.", "problem": "The analysis of Walsh diagrams is a powerful tool in quantum chemistry for predicting the shapes of small molecules. It correlates the energies of molecular orbitals with changes in a molecule's geometry, such as its bond angle.\n\nConsider the sulfur dioxide molecule, $SO_2$, which is known to be a bent triatomic molecule with 18 valence electrons. We are interested in predicting how its O-S-O bond angle changes when it accepts an additional electron to form the anion $SO_2^-$. In this process, the added electron occupies the orbital that was the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) in the neutral $SO_2$ molecule.\n\nTheoretical calculations, consistent with a general Walsh diagram for $AB_2$ type molecules, reveal the following property of the $SO_2$ LUMO: its energy is strongly dependent on the O-S-O bond angle, $\\theta$. Specifically, as the molecule's geometry changes from linear ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$) to a more bent configuration (i.e., as $\\theta$ decreases), the energy of this LUMO is significantly lowered.\n\nBased on this information and the general principle that molecules adopt a geometry that minimizes their total energy, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the change in bond angle and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The bond angle will increase, because the added electron occupies an orbital that is stabilized at larger angles.\n\nB. The bond angle will decrease, because the added electron occupies an orbital that is stabilized at smaller angles.\n\nC. The bond angle will not change significantly, because the added electron enters a non-bonding orbital whose energy is independent of the angle.\n\nD. The bond angle will increase, because the increased overall electron-electron repulsion is best relieved by moving the terminal oxygen atoms further apart.\n\nE. The bond angle will decrease, because adding an electron weakens the S-O bonds, causing the molecule to relax into a more compact, bent shape.", "solution": "We use the Walsh diagram principle: the equilibrium geometry minimizes the total electronic energy, which can be tracked by how occupied molecular orbital energies vary with the bond angle. Let $\\theta$ be the O-S-O bond angle. Let $E^{0}(\\theta)$ be the total energy of neutral $SO_{2}$ and $\\varepsilon_{L}(\\theta)$ be the energy of the LUMO of neutral $SO_{2}$. By the statement, as $\\theta$ decreases from linearity, $\\varepsilon_{L}(\\theta)$ decreases significantly; equivalently,\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{L}}{d\\theta} > 0\n$$\nover the relevant range, meaning increases in $\\theta$ raise $\\varepsilon_{L}$, while decreases in $\\theta$ lower it.\n\nUpon adding one electron to form $SO_{2}^{-}$, and within the Walsh analysis framework, the anion total energy can be approximated as\n$$\nE^{-}(\\theta) = E^{0}(\\theta) + \\varepsilon_{L}(\\theta) + \\Delta(\\theta),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta(\\theta)$ represents smaller corrections from electron-electron interactions and relaxation beyond the one-electron picture.

Therefore, to reach the new minimum of $E^{-}(\\theta)$, the system must move toward smaller $\\theta$ (into a region where the slope of $E^{-}(\\theta)$ changes sign), i.e., to a more bent geometry. This follows the general Walsh rule: occupying an orbital that is stabilized upon bending drives the molecule to bend further.\n\nThus the bond angle decreases upon electron attachment because the added electron occupies an orbital that is stabilized at smaller angles. This directly selects option B. Options A and D contradict the given angular stabilization trend. Option C is invalid because the LUMO energy is not angle-independent. Option E, while predicting a decrease, gives an incorrect generic rationale not tied to the explicit Walsh stabilization of the specific LUMO with angle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1422368"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, this practice explores a complementary scenario that solidifies your understanding of Walsh diagrams. Here [@problem_id:1422390], we examine how populating a molecular orbital that is *destabilized* by bending influences the equilibrium bond angle. This contrast highlights the versatility of Walsh diagrams in rationalizing a wide range of geometric structures based on electronic configuration.", "problem": "Walsh diagrams are used in quantum chemistry to illustrate how the energies of molecular orbitals (MOs) for a particular molecule change as its geometry is distorted. Consider the triatomic amidogen species, which can exist as a neutral radical ($NH_2$) or an anion ($NH_2^-$). The geometry of such an $AH_2$ molecule can be described by the H-A-H bond angle.\n\nA simplified Walsh diagram for an $AH_2$ molecule provides the following information about its valence molecular orbitals as the molecule changes from a linear geometry (180°) to a bent geometry (e.g., 90°):\n\n1.  An orbital with $a_1$ symmetry, which is doubly occupied in both $NH_2$ and $NH_2^-$, is strongly stabilized by bending. This means its energy decreases significantly as the bond angle becomes smaller.\n2.  The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the $NH_2$ radical is an orbital with $b_1$ symmetry. This orbital's energy slightly increases as the molecule bends (i.e., its energy is minimized at the linear 180° geometry).\n3.  The amidogen anion, $NH_2^-$, is formed by adding one electron to the $NH_2$ radical. This electron occupies the lowest available energy level, which is the aforementioned $b_1$ orbital.\n\nBased on this information and the principles of Walsh diagrams, determine the relationship between the equilibrium bond angle of the $NH_2^-$ anion and the $NH_2$ radical.\n\nA. The bond angle in $NH_2^-$ is larger than in $NH_2$.\n\nB. The bond angle in $NH_2^-$ is smaller than in $NH_2$.\n\nC. The bond angles are essentially identical.\n\nD. The $NH_2^-$ anion will become a linear molecule.\n\nE. A prediction cannot be made without knowing the behavior of all other orbitals.", "solution": "Let $\\theta$ denote the H–A–H bond angle. In the Walsh diagram approximation, the total electronic energy is written as the sum of the occupied MO energies,\n$$\nE(\\theta)=\\sum_{i\\in \\text{occ}} n_{i}\\,\\varepsilon_{i}(\\theta),\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{i}(\\theta)$ is the energy of MO $i$ and $n_{i}$ is its occupation number. The equilibrium angle satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{d\\theta}=0.\n$$\n\nFrom the given Walsh behavior:\n- The $a_{1}$ orbital is doubly occupied in both $NH_{2}$ and $NH_{2}^{-}$ and is strongly stabilized by bending, i.e., $\\varepsilon_{a_1}(\\theta)$ decreases as $\\theta$ decreases. Thus $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{a_1}}{d\\theta}>0$.\n- The $b_{1}$ orbital is the HOMO of $NH_{2}$; its energy slightly increases upon bending, i.e., $\\varepsilon_{b_1}(\\theta)$ increases as $\\theta$ decreases. Thus $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{b_1}}{d\\theta}<0$, with its minimum at the linear geometry.\n\nLet $\\theta_{r}$ be the equilibrium angle of the radical $NH_{2}$.

Physically, doubling the occupancy of an orbital that is destabilized by bending increases the preference for a less bent (larger angle) geometry.\n\nBecause the $a_{1}$ orbital remains doubly occupied and is strongly stabilized by bending in both species, it prevents linearization; thus the anion does not become linear. The qualitative trend is determined by the stated orbitals, so a prediction is possible.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium bond angle in $NH_{2}^{-}$ is larger than in $NH_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1422390"}, {"introduction": "While powerful, simple models in chemistry often have important limitations. This final practice [@problem_id:1422415] delves into a well-known exception to the introductory Walsh diagram rules for $AX_2$ molecules. By examining why a molecule like $CaF_2$ is bent against the simple prediction, we can appreciate the crucial role that factors beyond valence s and p orbitals, such as d-orbital participation, can play in determining molecular structure.", "problem": "Walsh diagrams are a powerful tool in quantum chemistry used to predict the geometry of small molecules by plotting the energy of molecular orbitals as a function of a geometric parameter, typically a bond angle. For a generic triatomic molecule of the type $AX_2$, a simple Walsh diagram constructed using only the valence s and p orbitals of the central atom A predicts that molecules with 16 or fewer valence electrons will be linear, while those with 17 to 20 valence electrons will be bent.\n\nHowever, experimental evidence from gas-phase studies shows that some alkaline earth dihalides are exceptions to this rule. For instance, Calcium Fluoride ($CaF_2$) is known to have a bent geometry with a bond angle of approximately 145°, despite having 16 valence electrons (2 from Ca, and 7 from each of the two F atoms).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate quantum mechanical reason for why the simple Walsh diagram model fails to predict the correct geometry for $CaF_2$?\n\nA. The simple Walsh diagram model neglects the participation of the energetically accessible d-orbitals of the central calcium atom, which can mix with other orbitals to stabilize the bent conformation.\n\nB. The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which is more accurate for ionic compounds, predicts a bent structure due to the presence of lone pairs on the calcium atom.\n\nC. The high electronegativity of fluorine atoms polarizes the electron density so strongly that the molecule is purely ionic, rendering molecular orbital theory and Walsh diagrams inapplicable.\n\nD. Repulsive interactions between the electron lone pairs on the two terminal fluorine atoms become the dominant factor, forcing the molecule to bend to minimize this repulsion.\n\nE. Relativistic effects, which are significant for the heavy calcium atom, contract the s-orbitals and expand the d-orbitals, altering the molecular orbital energy levels in a way not captured by the simple model.", "solution": "We begin from the premise of Walsh diagrams for $AX_2$ molecules that include only the central atom’s valence $s$ and $p$ orbitals. In that restricted basis, the qualitative energy ordering of molecular orbitals as a function of bond angle predicts that species with 16 or fewer valence electrons are linear because the set of MOs derived from the central atom $s$ and $p$ orbitals (notably the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$-type combinations) are optimized at linear geometry.\n\nHowever, for $CaF_2$ the central atom possesses low-lying, energetically accessible $d$ orbitals (the $3d$ shell of Ca). If the molecule is bent, the point group is $C_{2v}$, and the ligand group orbitals constructed from the two $X$ atoms can transform as $a_1$, $b_1$, and $b_2$. The central atom $d$ orbitals decompose under $C_{2v}$ as linear combinations having $a_1$ symmetry (from $d_{z^{2}}$), $b_1$ (from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ or $d_{xy}$, depending on the chosen axis), and $b_2$ (from $d_{xz}$ or $d_{yz}$), so there exist symmetry-allowed interactions between occupied ligand-based orbitals and the empty $d$ orbitals of Ca when the molecule is bent. By contrast, at linear geometry ($D_{\\infty h}$ for homonuclear terminals), the corresponding symmetry prevents certain $s/p$–$d$ mixing matrix elements from being nonzero, thereby suppressing this stabilizing interaction.\n\nThe energetic consequence can be written via second-order perturbation theory (second-order Jahn–Teller or pseudo–Jahn–Teller stabilization):\n$$\n\\Delta E^{(2)} \\;=\\; -\\sum_{o,u} \\frac{|\\langle \\phi_{o} | H' | \\phi_{u} \\rangle|^{2}}{E_{u}-E_{o}},\n$$\nwhere $|\\phi_{o}\\rangle$ denotes occupied states (largely ligand group orbitals with appropriate symmetry), $|\\phi_{u}\\rangle$ denotes low-lying empty central-atom orbitals (including Ca $3d$ functions), and $H'$ is the perturbation associated with bending. In $CaF_2$, the energy gap $E_{u}-E_{o}$ between ligand-based occupied orbitals and the Ca $3d$ manifold is sufficiently small that the term\n$$\n-\\frac{|\\langle \\phi_{o} | H' | \\phi_{u} \\rangle|^{2}}{E_{u}-E_{o}}\n$$\nis sizeable, leading to a net stabilization upon bending. This stabilization is absent in a Walsh diagram that excludes $d$ orbitals, hence that simple model overestimates the stability of the linear geometry for 16-electron $AX_2$ species.\n\nWe can rule out the alternative explanations as follows:\n- VSEPR invoking lone pairs on calcium (Option B) is incorrect; $Ca$ is essentially $Ca^{2+}$ with no valence lone pairs in this context, and VSEPR does not supersede MO arguments here.\n- A claim of complete ionic character making MO theory inapplicable (Option C) is false; MO descriptions remain valid, and the bonding is not purely ionic in a way that would nullify Walsh-type considerations.\n- Dominant repulsion between terminal-atom lone pairs (Option D) is neither the primary nor a generally sufficient driver of bending in these dihalides; moreover, Walsh diagrams implicitly account for ligand interactions through group orbitals.\n- Relativistic effects (Option E) are comparatively small for calcium ($Z=20$) and are not the principal reason for the deviation; the decisive factor is the low-lying $3d$ participation and the associated second-order stabilization upon bending, which the simple $s/p$-only Walsh model neglects.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate quantum mechanical reason for the failure of the simple Walsh diagram in $CaF_2$ is the neglect of central-atom $d$ orbitals whose symmetry-allowed mixing in the bent geometry gives a significant second-order stabilization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1422415"}]}
