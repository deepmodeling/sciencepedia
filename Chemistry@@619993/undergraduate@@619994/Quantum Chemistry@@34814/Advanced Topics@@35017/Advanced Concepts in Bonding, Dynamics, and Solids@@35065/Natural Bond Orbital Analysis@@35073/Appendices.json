After performing a calculation, the student runs a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to understand the nature of the chemical bond between the two atoms. The NBO analysis transforms the complex molecular orbitals into a more intuitive picture of localized bonds and lone pairs. For the primary bonding orbital between lithium (atom 1) and hydrogen (atom 2), the program provides the following output snippet:\n\n```\n(1.98765) BD (1) Li 1 - H 2\n          ( 12.34%)   0.3513*Li 1 s(100.00%)\n          ( 87.66%)   0.9363*H  2 s(100.00%)\n```\n\nHere, `BD (1)` refers to the first bonding orbital, `(1.98765)` is its electron occupation, the percentages `(12.34%)` and `(87.66%)` represent the contribution of each atom's orbital to the bond, and the numerical values `0.3513` and `0.9363` are the coefficients of the respective atomic orbitals in the linear combination that forms the bond.\n\nBased exclusively on the NBO data provided, which of the following statements most accurately describes the polarity of the Li-H bond?\n\nA. The bond is polarized towards Hydrogen, as indicated by Hydrogen's larger percentage contribution (87.66%) to the bonding orbital.\n\nB. The bond is polarized towards Lithium, because as the atom with the smaller coefficient (0.3513), it attracts the electron density more strongly.\n\nC. The bond is essentially nonpolar, because the bonding orbital is formed from pure s-orbitals on both atoms, indicating symmetric sharing.\n\nD. The bond is polarized towards Lithium, because the analysis lists the Lithium atom first in the `Li 1 - H 2` designation.\n\nE. The provided data is insufficient to determine the bond's polarity, as this requires the electronegativity values for Li and H.", "solution": "We interpret the NBO bonding orbital as a normalized linear combination of atomic orbitals on Li and H.

Squaring the coefficients yields the orbital fractions on each atom:\n$$\n|c_{\\text{Li}}|^{2}\\approx 0.3513^{2}\\approx 0.1234,\\quad |c_{\\text{H}}|^{2}\\approx 0.9363^{2}\\approx 0.8766.\n$$\nThese match the reported atomic contributions (0.1234 and 0.8766, respectively). The electron occupation of this bonding NBO is $n\\approx 1.98765$ electrons, so the electron populations associated with this bond on each atom are\n$$\nn_{\\text{Li}}=n\\,|c_{\\text{Li}}|^{2},\\qquad n_{\\text{H}}=n\\,|c_{\\text{H}}|^{2}.\n$$\nSince $|c_{\\text{H}}|^{2}\\gg |c_{\\text{Li}}|^{2}$, it follows that $n_{\\text{H}}\\gg n_{\\text{Li}}$, i.e., the bonding electron density is predominantly localized on hydrogen. Therefore, the bond is polarized toward hydrogen.\n\nThis directly rules out the alternatives:\n- The smaller coefficient on lithium does not imply stronger attraction of electron density; rather, it indicates a smaller contribution to the bonding NBO, so option B is incorrect.\n- The fact that both basis functions are $s$-type does not imply nonpolarity; the highly unequal weights demonstrate polarity, so option C is incorrect.\n- The listing order “Li 1 - H 2” is purely nominative and not indicative of polarity, so option D is incorrect.\n- The NBO contributions themselves provide sufficient information about the direction of bond polarization; one does not need external electronegativity values to conclude the direction from these data, so option E is incorrect.\n\nHence, the correct statement is that the bond is polarized toward hydrogen due to its much larger contribution to the bonding orbital.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1383438"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing individual bonds, NBO analysis provides a complete accounting of an atom's valence orbitals, based on the principle of orbital conservation.
