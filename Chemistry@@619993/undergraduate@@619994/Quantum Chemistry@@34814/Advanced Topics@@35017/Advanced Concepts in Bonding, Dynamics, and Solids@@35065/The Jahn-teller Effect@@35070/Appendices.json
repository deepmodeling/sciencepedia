By Hund’s rule and the weak-field condition, the electron configuration is\n$$\nt_{2g}^{5} e_{g}^{2}\n$$.\nThe Jahn-Teller theorem states that any non-linear molecule in a degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometric distortion that removes the degeneracy and lowers the total energy. In octahedral complexes, the strongest Jahn-Teller distortions arise when the $e_{g}$ set is unevenly occupied (e.g., $e_{g}^{1}$ or $e_{g}^{3}$), because $e_{g}$ orbitals ($d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$) point directly at ligands and are strongly antibonding. This typically leads to a significant tetragonal elongation or compression.\n\nFor the high-spin $d^{7}$ case, the $e_{g}$ set is evenly occupied with one electron in each $e_{g}$ orbital, so there is no first-order Jahn-Teller driving force from the $e_{g}$ manifold. However, the $t_{2g}^{5}$ configuration is orbitally degenerate in the $t_{2g}$ set (equivalently, it can be viewed as $t_{2g}^{1}$ with a hole), which can produce a Jahn-Teller effect. Because $t_{2g}$ orbitals do not point directly at ligands and are less antibonding, the associated Jahn-Teller distortion is typically weak. The usual outcome is a slight tetragonal distortion (elongation or compression) along a four-fold axis that lifts the residual $t_{2g}$-derived degeneracy:\n$$\nO_{h} \\to D_{4h}, \\quad t_{2g} \\to b_{2g} + e_{g}, \\quad e_{g} \\to a_{1g} + b_{1g}.\n$$\nThus, a weak geometric distortion is expected rather than a strong distortion, a perfect octahedron, a wholesale rearrangement to trigonal prismatic geometry, or a spin-state change (especially since water is a weak-field ligand favoring high spin).\n\nTherefore, the correct expectation is a weak Jahn-Teller distortion with slight elongation or compression along a four-fold axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294593"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand the Jahn-Teller effect, we must look beyond electron-counting rules and delve into the language of molecular symmetry.
