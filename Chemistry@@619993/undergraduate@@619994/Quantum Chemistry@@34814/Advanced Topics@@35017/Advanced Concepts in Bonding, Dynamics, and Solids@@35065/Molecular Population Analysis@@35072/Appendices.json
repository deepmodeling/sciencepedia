Within the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) framework, the total number of electrons, $N$, can be expressed as the sum of net atomic populations on each atom and overlap populations for each pair of atoms. The Mulliken overlap population, denoted $q_{AB}$ for a pair of atoms A and B, is a measure of the electron density accumulated in the region between the two nuclei.\n\nConsider a hypothetical homonuclear diatomic molecule, $X_2$, for which a molecular orbital calculation has been performed. The analysis of the resulting wavefunction yields a Mulliken overlap population between the two X atoms of $q_{XX} = -0.018$.\n\nBased on this result, which of the following statements provides the most accurate physical interpretation of the interaction between the two atoms in the $X_2$ molecule?\n\nA. A strong covalent bond has formed, as the negative value indicates electrons are attracted away from the midpoint and closer to the nuclei.\nB. The interaction is antibonding; electron density in the internuclear region is depleted, leading to a net repulsive force between the nuclei.\nC. The value, being close to zero, signifies a purely ionic interaction where electrons have been fully transferred from one atom to the other.\nD. This result indicates an error in the calculation, as the electron density, and therefore the overlap population, cannot be negative.\nE. The two atoms form a stable molecule held together by weak van der Waals forces, which are characterized by a small, negative overlap population.", "solution": "We begin with the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) framework and Mulliken population analysis. The total number of electrons $N$ is partitioned into net atomic populations and pairwise overlap populations:\n$$\nN = \\sum_{A} P_{A} + \\sum_{AB} q_{AB}.\n$$\nHere, $q_{AB}$ is the Mulliken overlap population between atoms $A$ and $B$. In terms of molecular orbital coefficients, for a closed-shell system it is commonly written as\n$$\nq_{AB} = 2 \\sum_{i}^{\\text{occ}} n_{i} \\sum_{\\mu \\in A} \\sum_{\\nu \\in B} c_{\\mu i}\\,c_{\\nu i}\\,S_{\\mu \\nu},\n$$\nwhere $n_{i}$ is the occupation number of molecular orbital $i$, $c_{\\mu i}$ are the MO coefficients on basis function $\\mu$, and $S_{\\mu \\nu}$ is the overlap integral between basis functions $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. The sign of $q_{AB}$ reflects the net phase-weighted overlap of the occupied MOs between atoms $A$ and $B$:\n- If the dominant contributions have $c_{\\mu i}$ and $c_{\\nu i}$ with the same sign on the two atoms and $S_{\\mu \\nu}  0$ (in-phase combination), then the cross term is positive and $q_{AB}  0$, indicating accumulation of electron density in the internuclear region (bonding character).\n- If the dominant contributions have opposite signs (out-of-phase combination), the cross term is negative and $q_{AB}  0$, indicating depletion of electron density in the internuclear region and the presence of a nodal character between the nuclei (antibonding character).\n\nPhysically, electron density in the internuclear region lowers the energy by screening nuclear repulsion and increasing electron-nucleus attraction across the bond, thus favoring bonding. Depletion of density in this region reduces screening and increases the effective nuclear-nuclear repulsion, which corresponds to antibonding character.\n\nFor the homonuclear diatomic $X_2$, the reported Mulliken overlap population is $q_{XX} = -0.018$. The negative sign directly indicates antibonding character, i.e., net depletion of electron density in the region between the two nuclei relative to what would be expected for a bonding interaction. The small magnitude indicates that this antibonding character is weak, but the sign still determines the qualitative interpretation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: a negative overlap population does not indicate a strong covalent bond; it indicates antibonding, not bonding.\n- B is correct: a negative $q_{XX}$ signifies antibonding with depleted internuclear electron density, which increases effective nuclear repulsion.\n- C is incorrect: a value close to zero does not imply a purely ionic interaction, especially for a homonuclear diatomic where full charge transfer is not meaningful; moreover, ionic character is not diagnosed by the sign of $q_{AB}$.\n- D is incorrect: negative overlap populations are physically meaningful and commonly interpreted as antibonding.\n- E is incorrect: van der Waals interactions are not characterized by a small negative Mulliken overlap population; dispersion-bound complexes typically exhibit negligible covalent overlap (values near zero), and a negative sign specifically implies antibonding rather than van der Waals stabilization.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is that the interaction is antibonding with a slight depletion of electron density in the internuclear region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1382554"}, {"introduction": "While conceptually powerful, population analysis methods have practical limitations that require careful consideration.
