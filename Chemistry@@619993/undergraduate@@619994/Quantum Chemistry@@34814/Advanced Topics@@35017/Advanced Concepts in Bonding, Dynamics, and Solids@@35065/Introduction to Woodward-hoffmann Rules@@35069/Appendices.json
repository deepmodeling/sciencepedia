This advanced conceptual problem explores the interplay between orbital symmetry analysis and modern computational chemistry, which can reveal stepwise, non-concerted reaction mechanisms. By reconciling these perspectives, you will gain a more nuanced understanding that a \"forbidden\" concerted pathway simply has a high energy barrier, often forcing the reaction to find a lower-energy, alternative route [@problem_id:1376474].", "problem": "The thermal rearrangement of vinylcyclopropane to cyclopentene is a classic example in physical organic chemistry. High-level computational studies of the reaction's potential energy surface consistently indicate a non-concerted, stepwise mechanism. These calculations show that the reaction proceeds by first breaking a carbon-carbon bond in the cyclopropane ring to form a short-lived diradical intermediate. This intermediate then rapidly undergoes ring closure to yield the final cyclopentene product. However, when viewed as a pericyclic reaction, this transformation can be classified as a [1,3]-sigmatropic shift. A standard analysis using the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for a thermally induced, concerted [1,3]-sigmatropic shift predicts that the suprafacial pathway is symmetry-forbidden.\n\nGiven these two established pieces of information—the computational evidence for a stepwise diradical mechanism and the theoretical prediction that the concerted pathway is forbidden—which of the following statements provides the most accurate and physically sound resolution to this apparent conflict?\n\nA. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules are derived from simplified models and are fundamentally invalid for rearrangements involving strained three-membered rings, so they should not be applied in this case.\n\nB. The computational results are likely in error; the species identified as a diradical intermediate is actually the high-energy, symmetric transition state for the concerted, symmetry-forbidden pathway predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\nC. The reaction avoids the symmetry-forbidden suprafacial pathway by proceeding through a thermally-allowed, concerted [1,3]-antarafacial sigmatropic shift, which is sterically unhindered and easily accessible for this molecular framework.\n\nD. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules exclusively assess the energetic favorability of concerted reaction pathways. The \"forbidden\" designation for the concerted [1,3]-suprafacial shift correctly indicates that this path has a high activation barrier, forcing the system to follow a lower-energy, non-concerted stepwise pathway via the diradical intermediate found computationally.\n\nE. The reaction should be reclassified as a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (a Cope rearrangement), which is well-known to be thermally allowed. The computational finding of a diradical is an artifact arising from the limitations of the theoretical methods used to model the potential energy surface.", "solution": "The problem asks us to reconcile the computational finding of a stepwise, diradical mechanism for the vinylcyclopropane-to-cyclopentene rearrangement with the Woodward-Hoffmann (WH) rule prediction that the concerted version of this reaction is symmetry-forbidden.\n\nLet's analyze the reaction and the provided options step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the Woodward-Hoffmann analysis. The reaction involves the migration of a sigma bond across a pi system. Let's number the carbons: `CH2(5)=CH(4)-CH(1)(CH2(2)-CH2(3))`. The rearrangement involves breaking the C2-C3 bond of the cyclopropane ring and forming a new sigma bond between C3 and C5. This constitutes the migration of the C1-C2 bond across the C4=C5 pi bond, with C3 as the migrating atom. This is a [1,3]-sigmatropic shift, where the migrating sigma bond moves from position 1 to position 3 of a three-atom chain (the allyl system formed notionally by C1-C4-C5).\n\nAccording to the rules for sigmatropic shifts, we analyze the interaction between the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the two fragments involved. Under thermal conditions, the controlling FMO interaction is between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of one fragment and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the other. The most common FMO analysis considers the HOMO of the extended pi system and the orbitals of the migrating group.\n\nFor a [1,3]-shift, the pi system is an allyl radical. The HOMO of the allyl system has lobes of opposite phase at its terminal carbons (C1 and C3 in the IUPAC numbering of allyl). For a concerted suprafacial shift, the migrating group must interact with the same face (e.g., the top face) of the pi system at both ends. Because the terminal lobes of the allyl HOMO have opposite symmetry, a bonding interaction at one end would be an antibonding interaction at the other. This orbital symmetry mismatch leads to a high activation energy barrier. Therefore, the thermal [1,3]-suprafacial sigmatropic shift is symmetry-forbidden, as stated in the problem.\n\nConversely, a thermal [1,3]-antarafacial shift, where the migrating group bonds to opposite faces of the pi system, is symmetry-allowed. However, this requires significant geometric distortion, forcing the small five-carbon framework to twist in a way that is sterically prohibited. The transition state for such a process would be extremely high in energy due to strain, making this pathway non-viable.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n\nOption A suggests the WH rules are invalid for this system. This is incorrect. The WH rules are a powerful and general theoretical framework derived from the conservation of orbital symmetry. While they are a model, they have been shown to be remarkably predictive for a vast range of pericyclic reactions, including those in strained systems. Their prediction is not that the reaction is impossible, but that the *concerted* path is unfavorable.\n\nOption B confuses a reaction intermediate with a transition state. A reaction intermediate, like the diradical, is a local minimum on the potential energy surface—it has a finite lifetime, however short. A transition state is a first-order saddle point, representing the point of maximum energy along a reaction coordinate. These are fundamentally different concepts. The computational results reliably distinguish between minima and saddle points.\n\nOption C suggests the reaction proceeds via an allowed [1,3]-antarafacial shift. As discussed above, while this pathway is indeed symmetry-allowed thermally, it is geometrically and sterically impossible for the vinylcyclopropane system. Therefore, this is not a viable low-energy path. This option tests the student's ability to consider not just electronic factors (symmetry) but also steric factors (geometry).\n\nOption E proposes a reclassification to a [3,3]-shift. A [3,3]-sigmatropic shift involves a six-atom system, which is not the case here. This is a clear misclassification of the reaction type. The Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene, not a vinylcyclopropane.\n\nOption D provides the correct resolution. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules and the concept of \"symmetry-forbidden\" apply specifically to *concerted* reaction mechanisms, where all bond-making and bond-breaking occur in a single step. The prediction that the concerted [1,3]-suprafacial shift is forbidden means that this specific pathway has a very high activation barrier due to orbital symmetry mismatch. Nature will always seek the lowest energy path available. If the concerted path is energetically costly, the system can and will follow an alternative, lower-energy pathway if one exists. The stepwise mechanism involving a diradical intermediate is precisely such an alternative. The computational results show that the activation energy to form the diradical is lower than the activation energy of the forbidden concerted process. Thus, the WH rules are not contradicted by the computational evidence; rather, they explain *why* the reaction avoids the concerted mechanism and proceeds stepwise. The two pieces of information are complementary, not contradictory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1376474"}]}
