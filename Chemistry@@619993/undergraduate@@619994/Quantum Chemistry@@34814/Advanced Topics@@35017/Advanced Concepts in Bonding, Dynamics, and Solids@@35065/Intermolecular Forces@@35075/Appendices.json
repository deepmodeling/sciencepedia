This exercise [@problem_id:1986852] is fundamental for understanding why isomers with the same chemical formula can exhibit vastly different behaviors.", "problem": "In organic chemistry, isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms in space. Consider the two geometric isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene ($\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_2\\text{Cl}_2$): cis-1,2-dichloroethene and trans-1,2-dichloroethene. A student in a laboratory must predict which of these two liquids will have a higher boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The key to this prediction lies in understanding how their different molecular structures affect the intermolecular forces between them.\n\nYou are to make your prediction based primarily on the differences in dipole-dipole interactions arising from the molecular geometry of each isomer. Assume that other types of intermolecular forces, such as London dispersion forces, are of a similar magnitude for both molecules.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate prediction and a correct explanation?\n\nA. The cis-isomer will have a higher boiling point because its molecular structure results in a non-zero net dipole moment, leading to stronger dipole-dipole interactions between molecules.\n\nB. The trans-isomer will have a higher boiling point because its symmetrical structure allows for more efficient packing in the liquid phase, leading to stronger overall intermolecular attractions.\n\nC. The trans-isomer will have a higher boiling point because the individual C-Cl bond dipoles are oriented in a way that maximizes intermolecular attraction, despite the molecule being nonpolar.\n\nD. The two isomers will have nearly identical boiling points because they have the same chemical formula and molar mass, which are the primary determinants of the strength of intermolecular forces.\n\nE. The cis-isomer will have a lower boiling point because steric hindrance between the chlorine atoms in its structure prevents molecules from approaching each other closely, weakening the overall intermolecular forces.", "solution": "We compare cis-1,2-dichloroethene and trans-1,2-dichloroethene by isolating the effect of permanent dipole-dipole interactions, as instructed, and assuming London dispersion forces are similar due to identical molecular formula and comparable polarizability.\n\n1) Molecular dipole moments arise as the vector sum of individual bond dipoles:\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{net}}=\\sum_{i}\\vec{\\mu}_{i}.\n$$\nIn 1,2-dichloroethene, the molecule is planar with two C-Cl and two C-H bonds around the double bond. For the trans isomer, the molecular geometry has an inversion symmetry that places the two C-Cl bonds opposite each other. Thus, the C-Cl bond dipoles are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{C-Cl},1}=-\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{C-Cl},2},\n$$\nand similarly the C-H bond dipoles cancel. Hence,\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{net}}^{\\text{trans}}=\\vec{0}.\n$$\nFor the cis isomer, the two C-Cl bond dipoles lie on the same side of the double bond and add vectorially, while the C-H dipoles add on the opposite side with smaller magnitude (since C-H bonds are less polar than C-Cl). Therefore,\n$$\n|\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{net}}^{\\text{cis}}|>0.\n$$\n\n2) The orientation-averaged interaction energy between permanent dipoles (Keesom interaction) for two identical molecules with dipole magnitude $\\mu$ separated by distance $r$ at temperature $T$ is\n$$\nU_{\\text{K}}(r,T)=-\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\mu^{4}}{(4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0})^{2}k_{B}T}\\frac{1}{r^{6}}.\n$$\nConsequently, if $\\mu=0$ (as in the trans isomer), the permanent dipole-dipole term vanishes:\n$$\nU_{\\text{K}}^{\\text{trans}}=0.\n$$\nFor the cis isomer with $\\mu=|\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{net}}^{\\text{cis}}|>0$,\n$$\nU_{\\text{K}}^{\\text{cis}}<0,\n$$\nindicating additional attractive stabilization relative to the trans isomer. By assumption, London dispersion contributions $U_{\\text{L}}(r)=-C_{6}/r^{6}$ have similar $C_{6}$ for both isomers, so the main difference in total attraction arises from the permanent dipole term, which is larger in magnitude (more negative) for the cis isomer.\n\n3) Stronger intermolecular attractions increase the enthalpy of vaporization $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$. From the Clausius-Clapeyron relation,\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln p}{dT}=\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R T^{2}},\n$$\nat fixed external pressure the liquid with larger $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ reaches its boiling condition at a higher temperature. Since the cis isomer has an extra attractive term from permanent dipole-dipole interactions, one expects\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}^{\\text{cis}}>\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}^{\\text{trans}}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad T_{b}^{\\text{cis}}>T_{b}^{\\text{trans}}.\n$$\n\n4) Therefore, the most accurate prediction and explanation, consistent with focusing on dipole-dipole interactions and assuming similar dispersion forces, is that the cis isomer has the higher boiling point because it has a nonzero net dipole moment that produces stronger dipole-dipole attractions between molecules.\n\nThis corresponds to option A; options B, C, D, and E either contradict the specified focus on dipole interactions or give incorrect physical reasoning for these isomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1986852"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theme of isomerism, this problem explores a fascinating case where the trends for boiling and melting points appear to contradict each other. You will analyze n-pentane and neopentane, two nonpolar isomers, to understand how molecular shape distinctly affects both London dispersion forces and the ability to pack into a stable crystal lattice. This practice [@problem_id:2177496] highlights the crucial difference between the intermolecular interactions governing the liquid state and the packing efficiency that stabilizes the solid state.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with identifying two unlabeled liquid samples, designated Compound P and Compound Q.

Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The lower boiling point of n-pentane is due to its chain flexibility. The higher melting point of neopentane is due to its rigid, branched structure which promotes stronger intermolecular attractions in the solid state.\n\nB. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane arises because its compact, spherical shape reduces the available surface area for contact between molecules, leading to weaker London dispersion forces. Its higher melting point is a result of its high symmetry, which allows for very efficient packing into a crystal lattice, making the solid state unusually stable.\n\nC. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. Both the lower boiling point and the higher melting point of neopentane are a consequence of its compact shape leading to weaker intermolecular forces compared to n-pentane.\n\nD. Compound P is n-pentane and Compound Q is neopentane. The trends are reversed from what is expected; n-pentane's larger size should lead to a higher melting point, and neopentane's compact structure should lead to a higher boiling point due to density effects.\n\nE. Compound P is neopentane and Compound Q is n-pentane. The lower boiling point of neopentane is due to weaker London dispersion forces associated with its smaller surface area. Its higher melting point is due to stronger dipole-dipole interactions that are only present in the solid phase.", "solution": "The problem requires us to identify two isomers, n-pentane and neopentane, based on their given boiling and melting points, and to select the correct physical-chemical explanation for these properties.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular structures.**\nBoth n-pentane and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) have the same molecular formula, $\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{12}$. This means they have the same molar mass, and any differences in physical properties must arise from their different shapes.\n*   **n-pentane**: A straight-chain alkane, its molecule is long, linear, and flexible.\n*   **neopentane**: A branched-chain alkane, its molecule is highly compact and symmetrical, approaching a spherical shape.\n\nSince both molecules are nonpolar alkanes, the only intermolecular forces present are London dispersion forces (a type of van der Waals force).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the boiling point trend.**\nBoiling is the process of transitioning from the liquid phase to the gas phase. This requires overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the molecules together in the liquid. The strength of London dispersion forces depends on the polarizability of the electron cloud and the surface area available for intermolecular contact.\n*   n-pentane's long, chain-like shape provides a large surface area for contact with neighboring molecules. This allows for stronger, more extensive London dispersion forces.\n*   neopentane's compact, spherical shape minimizes its surface area. This reduces the area of contact between molecules, resulting in weaker London dispersion forces.\n\nTherefore, more energy is required to separate n-pentane molecules than neopentane molecules. This means n-pentane should have a higher boiling point than neopentane.\nComparing the data: Compound Q has a boiling point of $36.1\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, while Compound P has a boiling point of $9.5\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. Thus, **Compound Q must be n-pentane**, and **Compound P must be neopentane**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the melting point trend.**\nMelting is the process of transitioning from the ordered solid (crystal lattice) to the less-ordered liquid phase. The energy required, and thus the melting point, depends on two main factors: the strength of the intermolecular forces and the efficiency of packing in the crystal lattice.\n*   n-pentane, being a flexible and somewhat awkward shape, does not pack very efficiently into a crystal lattice. There are gaps and inefficiencies in the solid structure.\n*   neopentane, due to its high degree of symmetry (it's nearly spherical), can pack very neatly and efficiently into a crystal lattice, similar to the way marbles pack in a box. This efficient packing leads to a very stable and well-ordered solid structure.\n\nAlthough the individual intermolecular forces are weaker for neopentane, the energy required to break down its highly ordered and stable crystal lattice is significantly greater than the energy required to melt the less-efficiently packed n-pentane solid.\nTherefore, neopentane should have a higher melting point than n-pentane.\nComparing the data: Compound P has a melting point of $-16.6\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, while Compound Q has a melting point of $-129.7\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. The much higher melting point of Compound P confirms that it is neopentane, and the much lower melting point of Compound Q confirms it is n-pentane. This aligns with our conclusion from Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n*   **A**: Incorrectly identifies P as n-pentane and Q as neopentane.\n*   **B**: Correctly identifies P as neopentane and Q as n-pentane. It correctly explains the lower boiling point of neopentane as due to its smaller surface area and weaker London dispersion forces. It correctly explains the higher melting point of neopentane as due to its high symmetry allowing for efficient crystal lattice packing. This statement is entirely correct.\n*   **C**: Correctly identifies the compounds but provides an incorrect explanation for the melting point. Weaker forces alone would suggest a lower, not higher, melting point. It misses the crucial concept of packing efficiency.\n*   **D**: Incorrectly identifies the compounds and provides incorrect reasoning.\n*   **E**: Correctly identifies the compounds and the reason for the boiling point difference. However, it incorrectly attributes the melting point trend to dipole-dipole interactions, which do not exist in these nonpolar molecules.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, statement B is the only one that correctly identifies both compounds and provides the correct physical-chemical reasoning for both boiling point and melting point trends.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2177496"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from qualitative comparisons to a quantitative mathematical description of the interaction between neutral atoms.
