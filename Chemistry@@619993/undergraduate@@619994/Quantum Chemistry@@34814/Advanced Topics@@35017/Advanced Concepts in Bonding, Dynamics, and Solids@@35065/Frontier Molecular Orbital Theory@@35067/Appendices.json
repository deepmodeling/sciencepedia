{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first exercise puts one of the core principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital theory into practice. When a molecule acts as a nucleophile, its reactivity is largely governed by the energy of its Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). By comparing the HOMO energies of two isomers, allene and propyne, you will predict which is more reactive towards an electrophile and solidify your understanding of the relationship between orbital energy and nucleophilicity [@problem_id:1370342].", "problem": "In the study of chemical reactivity, Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory provides a powerful model for predicting the outcomes of reactions. Consider the reaction of a C₃H₄ isomer with a generic electrophile. A computational chemistry analysis was performed on two such isomers: allene (CH₂=C=CH₂) and propyne (CH₃C≡CH). The analysis yielded the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) for each molecule.\n\nFor allene, the HOMO energy is -10.18 eV.\nFor propyne, the HOMO energy is -10.36 eV.\n\nBased on these results and the principles of FMO theory, which of the following statements correctly predicts the relative reactivity of these isomers towards an electrophile and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Allene is more reactive than propyne because its HOMO energy is higher (less negative), making its valence electrons more available for donation to an electrophile.\n\nB. Propyne is more reactive than allene because its HOMO energy is higher (less negative), making its valence electrons more available for donation to an electrophile.\n\nC. Propyne is more reactive than allene because its HOMO energy is lower (more negative), which indicates a more electron-rich system that is more attracted to an electrophile.\n\nD. Allene is more reactive than propyne because its HOMO energy is lower (more negative), which corresponds to a less stable orbital that is more prone to react.\n\nE. Both molecules will have the same reactivity towards an electrophile because they are isomers with the same molecular formula.", "solution": "We identify the relevant FMO principle: when a nucleophile reacts with an electrophile, the dominant stabilizing interaction occurs between the nucleophile’s HOMO and the electrophile’s LUMO. In second-order perturbation theory, the interaction energy is strengthened when the HOMO energy of the nucleophile is higher (less negative), because the energy denominator between the interacting orbitals is reduced and electron donation is facilitated. Symbolically, for a nucleophile N and electrophile E, the leading stabilization can be sketched as\n$$\n\\Delta E \\propto -\\frac{|\\langle \\psi_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{N}}|\\hat{H}'|\\psi_{\\text{L}}^{\\text{E}}\\rangle|^{2}}{\\epsilon_{\\text{L}}^{\\text{E}}-\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{N}}},\n$$\nso larger $\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{N}}$ (less negative) makes the denominator smaller and the magnitude of stabilization larger, increasing reactivity toward the electrophile.\nAdditionally, by Koopmans’ theorem, the ionization energy $I$ of the molecule is approximately $I \\approx -\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}$. Thus, a higher HOMO energy (less negative $\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}$) corresponds to a smaller $I$, meaning electrons are less tightly bound and more easily donated, which increases nucleophilicity and reactivity toward electrophiles.\n\nWe compare the given HOMO energies:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{allene}} = -10.18\\ \\text{eV}, \\quad \\epsilon_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{propyne}} = -10.36\\ \\text{eV}.\n$$\nSince $-10.18\\ \\text{eV} > -10.36\\ \\text{eV}$, we have $\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{allene}} > \\epsilon_{\\text{H}}^{\\text{propyne}}$, which implies $I_{\\text{allene}}  I_{\\text{propyne}}$ by $I \\approx -\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}$. Therefore, allene is the better electron donor (more nucleophilic) and should be more reactive toward a generic electrophile.\n\nEvaluating the statements:\n- A correctly states that allene is more reactive because its HOMO is higher (less negative), making its electrons more available for donation.\n- B is incorrect because propyne does not have the higher HOMO.\n- C is incorrect because a lower (more negative) HOMO corresponds to a larger $I$, not a more electron-donating system toward an electrophile.\n- D is incorrect because a lower (more negative) HOMO is more stable and less prone to donate electrons.\n- E is incorrect because isomerism does not guarantee identical frontier orbital energies or reactivities.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1370342"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple energy comparisons, this problem explores how the spatial distribution of the HOMO influences reactivity. You will analyze an enolate ion, a classic ambident nucleophile, to understand why it reacts at different sites depending on the nature of the electrophile. This practice illustrates the powerful interplay between orbital control, favored by soft electrophiles, and charge control, favored by hard electrophiles, providing a more sophisticated framework for predicting reaction outcomes [@problem_id:1370340].", "problem": "An enolate ion is a key intermediate in organic chemistry, known for its ability to act as an ambident nucleophile, meaning it can react with electrophiles at two different sites. Consider the enolate of propanal, which has the structure $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{O}^-$. Its reactivity can be analyzed using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which posits that chemical reactions are often governed by the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the nucleophile and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the electrophile.\n\nA simplified quantum chemical calculation provides the following data for the $\\pi$-system of the propanal enolate. The data includes the energies and the atomic orbital coefficients for the two highest energy occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and HOMO-1) at the $\\alpha$-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) and the oxygen atom ($O$).

Soft electrophiles are primarily governed by orbital control and will preferentially react at the oxygen atom because its coefficient is largest in the HOMO-1 orbital. Hard electrophiles react at the $\\alpha$-carbon.\n\nB. All electrophiles will react at the oxygen atom because it has both the largest negative charge and a large coefficient in the HOMO-1 orbital.\n\nC. Hard electrophiles are primarily governed by charge control and react at the oxygen atom due to its larger negative charge. Soft electrophiles are governed by orbital control and react at the $\\alpha$-carbon, which has the largest orbital coefficient in the HOMO.\n\nD. Hard electrophiles react at the $\\alpha$-carbon because its net charge is less negative, making it a \"softer\" center. Soft electrophiles react at the oxygen atom because it is a \"harder\" center, following the \"like reacts with like\" principle which is an exception to FMO theory.\n\nE. All electrophiles will react at the $\\alpha$-carbon because it has the largest orbital coefficient in the HOMO, and reactions are always controlled by the HOMO-LUMO interaction.", "solution": "We apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory together with the hard–soft acid–base (HSAB) concept interpreted as charge control (hard) versus orbital control (soft).\n\nFor soft electrophiles, reactivity is governed by HOMO–LUMO orbital interactions. The second-order stabilization from donor HOMO to acceptor LUMO is approximately\n$$\n\\Delta E^{(2)} \\approx -\\frac{|F_{HL}|^{2}}{\\Delta E_{HL}},\n$$\nwith the Fock matrix element scaling as\n$$\nF_{HL} \\propto \\beta\\,c_{\\text{site}}\\,c_{\\text{LUMO}},\n$$\nso, for a given electrophile, larger $|c_{\\text{site}}|$ in the nucleophile HOMO increases interaction. From the table, the HOMO coefficients are $c_{C_{\\alpha}}=0.71$ and $c_{O}=-0.42$. Since $|0.71|>|0.42|$, the HOMO is more localized at $C_{\\alpha}$, predicting that soft electrophiles (e.g., $\\text{CH}_{3}\\text{I}$) will favor $C$-attack. Although the HOMO-1 has a larger coefficient on oxygen ($0.81$), its lower energy makes $\\Delta E_{(HOMO-1)-LUMO}$ larger, reducing its contribution relative to the HOMO; thus the HOMO, not HOMO-1, controls soft-electrophile reactivity.\n\nFor hard electrophiles, reactivity is governed predominantly by electrostatics (charge control), which can be represented by a Coulombic stabilization proportional to\n$$\nE_{\\text{Coul}} \\propto \\frac{q_{\\text{el}}\\,q_{\\text{site}}}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}\\,r},\n$$\nwith $q_{\\text{el}}>0$ for a hard electrophile such as $H^{+}$. The site with the more negative charge provides greater stabilization (more negative energy). From the table, $q_{O}=-0.88$ and $q_{C_{\\alpha}}=-0.45$, so hard electrophiles preferentially react at oxygen.\n\nTherefore, hard electrophiles react at oxygen by charge control, and soft electrophiles react at $C_{\\alpha}$ by orbital control using the HOMO coefficients. This matches statement C and rules out alternatives: A incorrectly prioritizes HOMO-1 for soft electrophiles; B and E ignore the duality of charge versus orbital control; D reverses hard/soft site preferences contrary to HSAB/FMO reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1370340"}, {"introduction": "Frontier Molecular Orbital theory also provides profound insights into pericyclic reactions, which proceed through concerted cyclic transition states. This problem challenges you to explain why a thermal [2+2] cycloaddition is forbidden for two simple alkenes but allowed for a ketene and an alkene. By applying FMO principles in the context of orbital symmetry and topology, you will uncover how the unique electronic structure of the ketene enables a geometrically feasible, symmetry-allowed reaction pathway [@problem_id:1370302].", "problem": "Experimental evidence shows that the thermal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between two ethylene molecules to form cyclobutane is highly unfavorable and considered \"symmetry-forbidden\" under concerted reaction conditions. However, the thermal [2+2] cycloaddition between a ketene ($R_2C=C=O$) and an alkene readily occurs to form a cyclobutanone derivative. Using the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions, identify the correct explanation for this marked difference in reactivity. For the purpose of this analysis, consider the reaction to be a concerted process involving the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of one reactant and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the other, and that the cycloaddition involves the C=C double bond of the ketene.\n\nA. The thermal [2+2] reaction is a 4$\\pi$-electron process, which is symmetry-allowed via a [suprafacial + antarafacial] pathway. A ketene can readily act as the antarafacial component due to its linear geometry, while this pathway is sterically inaccessible for a simple alkene.\n\nB. The reaction is allowed because the HOMO of the ketene and the HOMO of the alkene have the correct symmetry for a suprafacial-suprafacial interaction, which is a lower energy pathway than a HOMO-LUMO interaction.\n\nC. The thermal [2+2] reaction is always allowed via a suprafacial-suprafacial pathway, but the high activation energy for two alkenes is purely due to steric hindrance, which is less pronounced for the less substituted ketene.\n\nD. The ketene is isoelectronic with $\\text{CO}_2$ and its LUMO has a different symmetry than an alkene's LUMO, allowing a photochemically-allowed pathway to occur under thermal conditions.\n\nE. The highly electronegative oxygen atom in the ketene drastically lowers the energy of its LUMO. This reduction in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap makes the reaction kinetically fast enough to overcome the symmetry-imposed barrier that forbids the reaction for two simple alkenes.", "solution": "We analyze the thermal $[2+2]$ cycloaddition using the Woodward–Hoffmann orbital symmetry rules and Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) reasoning, under the assumption of a concerted pathway involving the HOMO of one component and the LUMO of the other, and that the ketene’s reactive site is its $C=C$ bond.\n\n1) Classification of the cycloaddition by electron count and topology:\n- A $[2+2]$ cycloaddition involves $4\\pi$ electrons in total.\n- For thermal pericyclic reactions, the Woodward–Hoffmann rules state:\n  - $4q$ electron cycloadditions (here $q=1$) are symmetry-allowed only via a mixed-topology pathway, namely a suprafacial plus antarafacial ($s+a$) interaction.\n  - A suprafacial plus suprafacial ($s+s$) pathway is symmetry-forbidden for $4q$ electrons under thermal conditions.\n\n2) Consequences for two simple alkenes:\n- For two simple alkenes, the thermally allowed option is $s+a$. However, executing an antarafacial interaction on a typical $C=C$ bond during formation of a four-membered ring is geometrically and sterically impractical because it requires opposite-face bonding at the two termini of the same double bond while closing a small ring. Hence, although $s+a$ is symmetry-allowed, it is effectively inaccessible for two alkenes; the $s+s$ pathway is symmetry-forbidden. This explains why the thermal $[2+2]$ of two alkenes is unfavorable under concerted conditions.\n\n3) Special orbital topology of ketenes:\n- A ketene $R_{2}C=C=O$ contains a cumulated system in which the two adjacent $\\pi$ systems are orthogonal. The reactive $C=C$ of the ketene can accommodate an antarafacial component more readily due to its linear, cumulated geometry and the distinct orientation of its frontier orbitals. Thus, in a concerted FMO interaction with an alkene, the thermally allowed $s+a$ pathway becomes geometrically feasible with the ketene serving as the antarafacial partner, while the alkene engages suprafacially.\n\n4) FMO phase matching:\n- In the allowed $s+a$ manifold, one considers the HOMO of one reactant and the LUMO of the other. For a simple alkene, the HOMO is the $\\pi$ orbital, and for the ketene, the relevant LUMO centered on the $C=C$ bond has the appropriate nodal properties such that, when approached in an antarafacial manner, both forming bonds overlap constructively with the phases of the partner’s frontier orbital. This phase-matched overlap is not available in an $s+s$ mode for a $4\\pi$ process under thermal conditions, and it is not geometrically accessible for two alkenes in an $s+a$ mode. With a ketene, the $s+a$ symmetry-allowed pathway becomes both symmetry- and geometry-allowed.\n\n5) Evaluation of the options:\n- A: Correct. It states that the thermal $[2+2]$ is a $4\\pi$ process that is symmetry-allowed via $[\\text{suprafacial}+\\text{antarafacial}]$, and that a ketene can serve as the antarafacial component due to its geometry while this pathway is inaccessible for a simple alkene.\n- B: Incorrect. Thermal $[2+2]$ via $s+s$ is symmetry-forbidden; invoking a HOMO–HOMO $s+s$ interaction does not resolve the orbital symmetry issue.\n- C: Incorrect. Thermal $[2+2]$ is not “always allowed” via $s+s$; $s+s$ is forbidden for $4\\pi$ electrons.\n- D: Incorrect. The reaction proceeds thermally, not by invoking a photochemical selection rule; ketene’s being isoelectronic with $\\text{CO}_2$ does not convert a photochemical allowance into a thermal one.\n- E: Incorrect. Lowering the HOMO–LUMO gap does not lift a symmetry-forbidden pathway; the key is the availability of an $s+a$ topology, not merely energy lowering.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the ketene enables the symmetry-allowed $s+a$ pathway by acting as the antarafacial component, which is not feasible for a simple alkene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1370302"}]}
