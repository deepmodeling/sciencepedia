This molecule has a linear conjugated system of four carbon atoms, each contributing one p-orbital and one electron to the $\\pi$-system. So, we have a 4-electron, 4-orbital system. The Hückel secular determinant for a linear 4-atom chain is given by:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\alpha - E & \\beta & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\beta & \\alpha - E & \\beta & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & \\alpha - E & \\beta \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\beta & \\alpha - E\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nTo simplify this, we can divide each entry by $\\beta$ and let $x = \\frac{\\alpha - E}{\\beta}$.
