You will assess a series of carbocyclic species, including both neutral molecules and charged ions, to determine if they are aromatic, anti-aromatic, or non-aromatic. This practice [@problem_id:1353683] is crucial for mastering the step-by-step application of the core criteria: analyzing the ring structure, planarity, conjugation, and finally, the pi-electron count using the $(4n+2)$ and $4n$ rules.", "problem": "In quantum chemistry, the concept of aromaticity describes a property of certain cyclic, planar molecules with a ring of resonance bonds that gives them exceptional stability. Hückel's rule is a powerful heuristic for predicting whether a monocyclic, planar, and fully conjugated system will exhibit aromatic character. The rule states that a system is aromatic if it contains a total of $(4n+2)$ pi electrons, where $n$ is any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, ...$). If a system meets the cyclic, planar, and conjugated criteria but possesses $4n$ pi electrons, it is termed anti-aromatic and is exceptionally unstable. Systems that fail to meet one or more of the criteria (e.g., are not cyclic, not planar, or not fully conjugated) are classified as non-aromatic.\n\nA chemistry student is analyzing the potential aromatic character of several species to predict their relative stability. The species under consideration are:\nI. The cyclobutadienyl dication ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4^{2+}$)\nII. The cycloheptatrienyl cation, also known as the tropylium cation ($\\text{C}_7\\text{H}_7^{+}$)\nIII. The cyclopropenyl anion ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_3^{-}$)\nIV. Cyclooctatetraene ($\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$), which is known to be non-planar\n\nBased on a rigorous application of Hückel's criteria, which of the following statements provides the correct classification for one of these species?\n\nA. The cyclopropenyl anion ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_3^{-}$) is aromatic because it is cyclic, planar, fully conjugated, and contains 4 pi electrons.\nB. The cyclobutadienyl dication ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4^{2+}$) is anti-aromatic because it is a four-membered ring, and four is a $4n$ number.\nC. Cyclooctatetraene ($\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$) is anti-aromatic because it is cyclic, fully conjugated, and contains 8 pi electrons.\nD. The cycloheptatrienyl cation ($\\text{C}_7\\text{H}_7^{+}$) is aromatic because it is cyclic, planar, fully conjugated, and contains 6 pi electrons.\nE. All of the listed charged species (I, II, and III) are non-aromatic because charged molecules cannot be aromatic.", "solution": "To determine the correct statement, we must analyze each species according to Hückel's criteria for aromaticity, anti-aromaticity, and non-aromaticity. The criteria for aromaticity are that the species must be:\n1. Cyclic\n2. Planar\n3. Fully conjugated (every atom in the ring must have a p-orbital participating in the pi system)\n4. Contain $(4n+2)$ pi electrons, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nA species that satisfies the first three criteria but has $4n$ pi electrons is anti-aromatic. A species that fails any of the first three criteria is non-aromatic.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Analysis of Option A:** The cyclopropenyl anion ($\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_3^{-}$).\n- **Cyclic:** Yes, it is a three-membered ring.\n- **Planar:** Yes, three-membered rings are planar.\n- **Fully conjugated:** Yes. The ring contains one double bond and a carbanion. For the lone pair of the carbanion to participate in resonance, it must occupy a p-orbital, creating a continuous ring of three p-orbitals.\n- **Pi electron count:** The system has 4 pi electrons (2 from the double bond and 2 from the lone pair). This fits the $4n$ rule for $n=1$.\n- **Conclusion for A:** Since it is cyclic, planar, and fully conjugated with $4n$ pi electrons, the cyclopropenyl anion is **anti-aromatic**, not aromatic. The statement claims it is aromatic, so statement A is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:** The cyclobutadienyl dication ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4^{2+}$).\n- **Cyclic:** Yes, it is a four-membered ring.\n- **Planar:** Yes, it is planar.\n- **Fully conjugated:** Neutral cyclobutadiene ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4$) has 4 pi electrons, one from each of the four $sp^2$-hybridized carbons. The dication is formed by removing two electrons from the pi system. This leaves a system with 2 pi electrons, but the ring of four p-orbitals remains, so it is fully conjugated.\n- **Pi electron count:** The system has 2 pi electrons. We check this against Hückel's rule: $4n+2=2 \\implies 4n=0 \\implies n=0$. Since $n=0$ is a valid non-negative integer, the system is aromatic.\n- **Conclusion for B:** The statement claims the dication is anti-aromatic. This is incorrect. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:** Cyclooctatetraene ($\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_8$).\n- **Cyclic:** Yes.\n- **Fully conjugated:** Yes, it has alternating single and double bonds around the ring.\n- **Pi electron count:** It has 4 double bonds, so it has $4 \\times 2 = 8$ pi electrons. This fits the $4n$ rule for $n=2$.\n- **Planar:** The problem explicitly states that this molecule is non-planar.\n- **Conclusion for C:** Because the molecule is not planar, it fails one of the fundamental criteria for both aromaticity and anti-aromaticity. Therefore, cyclooctatetraene is classified as non-aromatic. The statement claims it is anti-aromatic, which is an incorrect classification for the non-planar molecule. Thus, statement C is false.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:** The cycloheptatrienyl cation ($\\text{C}_7\\text{H}_7^{+}$), or tropylium cation.\n- **Cyclic:** Yes, it is a seven-membered ring.\n- **Planar:** Yes, the cation is known to be planar.\n- **Fully conjugated:** The neutral cycloheptatriene molecule has one $sp^3$-hybridized $\\text{CH}_2$ group, which breaks the conjugation. However, in the cation, this carbon becomes a carbocation, rehybridizes to $sp^2$, and has an empty p-orbital. This empty p-orbital completes the continuous ring of p-orbitals, making the system fully conjugated.\n- **Pi electron count:** The neutral precursor has 3 double bonds, meaning 6 pi electrons. Removing a hydride ($H^-$) from the $\\text{CH}_2$ group to form the cation does not change the number of pi electrons in the ring system. It has 6 pi electrons.\n- **Check against rule:** We check the pi electron count: $4n+2=6 \\implies 4n=4 \\implies n=1$. Since $n=1$ is a valid non-negative integer, the system is aromatic.\n- **Conclusion for D:** The statement correctly identifies the species as cyclic, planar, fully conjugated, containing 6 pi electrons, and therefore aromatic. Thus, statement D is true.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:** This statement makes a general claim that charged species cannot be aromatic. This is fundamentally incorrect. Aromaticity depends on the electronic structure and geometry, not the net charge. As we have seen with the tropylium cation ($\\text{C}_7\\text{H}_7^{+}$) and the cyclobutadienyl dication ($\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4^{2+}$), cations can be aromatic. The cyclopentadienyl anion ($\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_5^{-}$) is a classic example of an aromatic anion. Therefore, statement E is false.\n\nThe only correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1353683"}, {"introduction": "Aromaticity is not limited to hydrocarbons; many important molecules contain heteroatoms within the ring.
