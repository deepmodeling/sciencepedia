This final practice challenges you to apply Valence Bond Theory to predict the most basic site in the aromatic molecule imidazole. By integrating concepts of hybridization, lone pair availability, and resonance stabilization, you will see how a careful analysis of electronic structure can explain and predict a molecule's reactivity, a cornerstone of chemical science [@problem_id:1419958].", "problem": "Imidazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle with the chemical formula $\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_4\\text{N}_2$. The atoms in the ring are numbered sequentially, starting with a nitrogen atom at position 1 (N1), a carbon at position 2, a second nitrogen at position 3 (N3), and carbons at positions 4 and 5 which connect back to N1. In the neutral molecule, N1 is bonded to a hydrogen atom and its lone pair contributes to the aromatic system. N3 is not bonded to a hydrogen atom and possesses a lone pair of electrons that is not part of the aromatic system. Both nitrogen atoms can act as Lewis bases and be protonated by an acid.\n\nUsing the principles of Valence Bond (VB) theory, specifically the concept of resonance, determine which nitrogen atom (N1 or N3) is the more basic site. Your analysis should focus on comparing the stability of the conjugate acids formed upon protonation at each site. Which of the following statements provides the correct identification and the most accurate justification?\n\nA. N1 is more basic. The conjugate acid formed by protonating N1 is more stable because it is a secondary amine, which is inherently more basic than the imine-like N3, and the resulting positive charge is delocalized over the entire ring.\n\nB. N3 is more basic. The lone pair on N3 is less available for protonation because it is held more tightly in an sp2 hybrid orbital compared to the p-orbital lone pair of N1.\n\nC. N1 is more basic. Protonating N1 generates a conjugate acid that has a greater number of possible resonance structures compared to the conjugate acid formed by protonating N3, leading to greater stabilization.\n\nD. N3 is more basic. The lone pair on N3 resides in an sp2 hybrid orbital, external to the aromatic pi-system. Protonation at N3 yields a symmetric, resonance-stabilized imidazolium cation that retains its aromatic character, with the positive charge delocalized over both nitrogen atoms.\n\nE. Both N1 and N3 are equally basic. The rapid tautomeric exchange of the proton between N1 and N3 makes the two sites electronically indistinguishable, leading to identical stabilities for the conjugate acids regardless of the initial protonation site.", "solution": "The basicity of a site is determined by its ability to donate a lone pair of electrons to a proton ($\\text{H}^+$). The strength of a base is inversely related to the stability of its conjugate acid; a stronger base will form a more stable conjugate acid. We will use Valence Bond (VB) theory to analyze the electronic structure of imidazole and the stability of the two possible conjugate acids formed by protonating N1 and N3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the electronic structure of neutral imidazole.**\nImidazole is an aromatic heterocycle. According to Hückel's rule, a planar, cyclic, fully conjugated system with $(4n+2)$ pi electrons is aromatic. In imidazole, all five ring atoms are sp2-hybridized.\n- The nitrogen at position 1 (N1), often called a \"pyrrole-type\" nitrogen, is bonded to one hydrogen and two carbon atoms. It uses its three sp2 hybrid orbitals for these three sigma bonds. Its lone pair of electrons resides in its remaining p-orbital, which is perpendicular to the plane of the ring. These two electrons are part of the aromatic pi-system.\n- The nitrogen at position 3 (N3), often called a \"pyridine-type\" nitrogen, is bonded to two carbon atoms. It uses two of its sp2 hybrid orbitals for these sigma bonds. The third sp2 hybrid orbital, which lies in the plane of the ring, contains its lone pair of electrons. Its remaining p-orbital contains a single electron, which contributes to the aromatic pi-system.\n- The three carbon atoms (C2, C4, C5) are also sp2-hybridized, each contributing one electron to the aromatic pi-system from their p-orbitals.\n- The total number of pi electrons is $2 \\text{ (from N1)} + 1 \\text{ (from N3)} + 1 \\text{ (from C2)} + 1 \\text{ (from C4)} + 1 \\text{ (from C5)} = 6$. Since 6 is a $(4n+2)$ number (for $n=1$), imidazole is aromatic. This aromaticity confers significant stabilization energy to the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the conjugate acid formed by protonation at N3.**\nThe lone pair on N3 is located in an sp2 hybrid orbital in the plane of the ring. It is sterically and electronically available for bonding with a proton.\n- When N3 is protonated, it uses this lone pair to form a new $\\text{N}-\\text{H}$ sigma bond. The resulting cation is the imidazolium ion.\n- The crucial point is that this protonation event does not involve the electrons of the aromatic pi-system. The 6-pi electron system remains intact, and the resulting imidazolium cation is therefore still aromatic.\n- The positive formal charge is initially on N3. However, due to the preserved conjugated system, this charge can be delocalized through resonance. The resulting cation is symmetric. We can draw two equivalent resonance structures:\n    1. One with the positive charge on N3 and double bonds at N1-C2 and C4-C5.\n    2. An equivalent structure where the positive charge is on N1 and double bonds are at C2-N3 and C4-C5.\n- This delocalization of the positive charge over two nitrogen atoms, combined with the preservation of aromaticity, makes the imidazolium ion a very stable conjugate acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conjugate acid formed by protonation at N1.**\nThe lone pair on N1 is located in a p-orbital and is an integral part of the 6-pi electron aromatic system.\n- To protonate N1, the lone pair from this p-orbital must be used to form a new $\\text{N}-\\text{H}$ sigma bond.\n- This action removes two electrons from the aromatic pi-system. The ring system in the resulting cation would be left with only 4 pi electrons.\n- A 4-pi electron system is anti-aromatic (or at best, non-aromatic), and it loses the significant stabilization energy associated with aromaticity.\n- The resulting conjugate acid is non-aromatic and its positive charge is more localized. The loss of aromatic stabilization energy makes this cation far less stable than the imidazolium ion formed by protonating N3.\n\n**Step 4: Compare stability and conclude.**\nThe conjugate acid formed by protonating N3 is aromatic and resonance-stabilized. The conjugate acid formed by protonating N1 is non-aromatic and has lost its aromatic stabilization energy. Therefore, the conjugate acid of N3 is vastly more stable than the conjugate acid of N1.\nSince a stronger base yields a more stable conjugate acid, N3 is a much stronger base than N1.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\n- A is incorrect. While N1 is like a secondary amine, its lone pair is involved in aromaticity, which is the overriding factor. The general rule does not apply. Protonation does not lead to a charge-delocalized stable species; it breaks aromaticity.\n- B is incorrect. The lone pair on N3 is in an sp2 orbital, which is more sterically available and \"points away\" from the ring, making it *more* available for protonation, not less. The p-orbital lone pair of N1 is delocalized and unavailable.\n- C is incorrect. Protonating N1 breaks aromaticity, leading to a much less stable cation, regardless of the number of resonance structures one might draw for the resulting non-aromatic diene system. The quality (stability) of resonance structures is more important than their quantity.\n- D is correct. It correctly identifies that the N3 lone pair is in an sp2 orbital outside the pi-system. It correctly states that protonation at N3 preserves aromaticity and leads to a resonance-stabilized symmetric cation where the charge is shared between the two nitrogen atoms. This accurately describes why N3 is the more basic site.\n- E is incorrect. While tautomerism does occur, the two nitrogen atoms are electronically distinct in the neutral molecule regarding their lone pairs. The initial act of protonation is overwhelmingly favored at the more basic N3 site due to the vast difference in the stability of the resulting conjugate acids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1419958"}]}
