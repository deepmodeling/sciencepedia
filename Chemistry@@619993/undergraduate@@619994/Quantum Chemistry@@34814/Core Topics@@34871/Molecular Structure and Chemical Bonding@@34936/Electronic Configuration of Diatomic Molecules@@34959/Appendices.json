Bond Order = 2.0, Diamagnetic", "solution": "We start by determining the total number of electrons in $B_2^-$. Each boron atom has atomic number $5$, so a neutral $B_2$ has $10$ electrons. The anion $B_2^-$ has one extra electron, hence $11$ total electrons. For bonding and magnetism, the $1s$ core orbitals are fully occupied and form $\\sigma_{1s}$ and $\\sigma_{1s}^{*}$ pairs that cancel in bond order and contribute no unpaired electrons. Therefore, we focus on the valence electrons. Each boron contributes $3$ valence electrons ($2s^2 2p^1$), so neutral $B_2$ has $6$ valence electrons, and $B_2^-$ has $7$ valence electrons.\n\nFor second-row homonuclear diatomics with $Z8$ (i.e., B, C, N), the relevant molecular orbital energy ordering for the valence shell is\n$$\n\\sigma_{2s}  \\sigma_{2s}^{*}  \\pi_{2p_{x}}=\\pi_{2p_{y}}  \\sigma_{2p_{z}}  \\pi_{2p}^{*}  \\sigma_{2p}^{*}.\n$$\nWe fill the $7$ valence electrons according to the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund’s rule:\n- Fill $\\sigma_{2s}$ with $2$ electrons: $n(\\sigma_{2s})=2$.\n- Fill $\\sigma_{2s}^{*}$ with $2$ electrons: $n(\\sigma_{2s}^{*})=2$.\n- The remaining $3$ electrons go into the degenerate $\\pi_{2p_{x}}$ and $\\pi_{2p_{y}}$ orbitals. Hund’s rule gives one electron in each, then the third pairs in one of them. Thus, across the two $\\pi$ orbitals we have $3$ electrons total with one unpaired: $n(\\pi_{2p})=3$.\n\nThe bond order is given by\n$$\n\\text{BO}=\\frac{N_{b}-N_{a}}{2},\n$$\nwhere $N_{b}$ is the total number of electrons in bonding MOs and $N_{a}$ is the total in antibonding MOs.

With $3$ electrons in the two degenerate $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, there is one unpaired electron, so $B_2^-$ is paramagnetic.\n\nMatching with the given options, this corresponds to bond order $1.5$ and paramagnetic character, which is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1366397"}, {"introduction": "Not all diatomic molecules follow the same molecular orbital energy ordering.
