An $sp^2$ hybridization scheme involves the mixing of one s atomic orbital and two p atomic orbitals to create three new, equivalent hybrid orbitals.\n\nThe \"character\" of a hybrid orbital (e.g., \"s-character\" or \"p-character\") is defined as the fractional contribution of a particular atomic orbital type to the hybrid orbital's overall wave function. A fundamental principle of hybridization is that the total character of a given atomic orbital type, when summed over all the generated hybrid orbitals, must equal the total number of atomic orbitals of that type used in the mixing. For the case of $sp^2$ hybridization, this means the sum of the s-characters across the three hybrid orbitals is 1, and the sum of the p-characters is 2.\n\nGiven that the three $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals are chemically and physically equivalent, determine the percentage of s-character and the percentage of p-character for a single $sp^2$ hybrid orbital.

For hybridization to be favorable, the energy gained from forming stronger, more stable bonds must outweigh the initial energy cost required to promote electrons and reconfigure the orbitals. This exercise uses a simplified energetic model to provide a quantitative look at this cost-benefit analysis, explaining why phosphine ($PH_3$) largely foregoes hybridization, unlike its lighter cousin ammonia ($NH_3$). This practice deepens your understanding by showing that chemical bonding principles are ultimately governed by thermodynamics.
