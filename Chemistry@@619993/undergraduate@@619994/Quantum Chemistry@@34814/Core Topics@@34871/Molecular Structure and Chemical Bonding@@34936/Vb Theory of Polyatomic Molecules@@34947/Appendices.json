It is an established experimental fact that the phosphate ion exhibits a perfect tetrahedral geometry, with the phosphorus atom at the center and the four oxygen atoms at the vertices. To account for this geometry, the students propose several different hybridization schemes for the central phosphorus atom. Their proposals are listed below.\n\n- **Proposal A:** The phosphorus atom is $sp$ hybridized.\n- **Proposal B:** The phosphorus atom is $sp^2$ hybridized.\n- **Proposal C:** The phosphorus atom is $sp^3$ hybridized.\n- **Proposal D:** The phosphorus atom is $sp^3d$ hybridized.\n- **Proposal E:** The phosphorus atom is unhybridized, using its pure atomic p-orbitals for bonding.\n\nBased on the principles of VB theory and the given molecular geometry, which of these proposals correctly describes the hybridization required for the central phosphorus atom to form the sigma-bond framework of the phosphate ion?", "solution": "Valence Bond (VB) theory relates the local geometry of the sigma-bond framework around a central atom to the set of hybrid orbitals used by that atom: to form $n$ equivalent sigma bonds directed toward $n$ vertices with the angles observed experimentally, the central atom forms $n$ equivalent hybrids whose orientations reproduce the molecular geometry. A perfect tetrahedral geometry with four equivalent sigma bonds requires four equivalent hybrids directed to the corners of a tetrahedron, which VB theory achieves by mixing one $s$ and three $p$ orbitals to create four $sp^{3}$ hybrids.\n\nEvaluate each proposal against this principle:\n- Proposal A ($sp$): $sp$ hybridization produces two equivalent hybrids oriented $180^{\\circ}$ apart, with the two remaining $p$ orbitals orthogonal to each other and to the $sp$ axis. Using these for four sigma bonds would produce bond angles of $180^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$, not a set of four equivalent bonds at $109.5^{\\circ}$; hence it cannot yield a perfect tetrahedron.\n- Proposal B ($sp^{2}$): $sp^{2}$ hybridization produces three equivalent hybrids in a trigonal planar arrangement ($120^{\\circ}$) with one unhybridized $p$ orbital perpendicular to the plane. Four sigma bonds made from these would not be equivalent and would not produce tetrahedral angles; thus it is incompatible with a perfect tetrahedral geometry.\n- Proposal C ($sp^{3}$): $sp^{3}$ hybridization mixes one $s$ and three $p$ orbitals to generate four equivalent hybrids directed toward the vertices of a tetrahedron, giving bond angles of $109.5^{\\circ}$. This exactly matches the observed perfect tetrahedral geometry and provides four equivalent orbitals for the four P–O sigma bonds.\n- Proposal D ($sp^{3}d$): $sp^{3}d$ hybridization produces five hybrids directed to a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement. Even if only four were used, any subset of four directions from a trigonal bipyramid is not a perfect tetrahedron (it yields a see-saw set of directions), so it does not reproduce a perfect tetrahedral set of four equivalent bonds. Moreover, invoking a fifth unused hybrid is unnecessary for a four-coordinate tetrahedral sigma framework.\n- Proposal E (unhybridized $p$ orbitals): Using pure atomic $p$ orbitals for bonding yields three orthogonal directions at $90^{\\circ}$ and, if the $s$ orbital were also used, one non-directional orbital; this cannot generate four equivalent, directional bonds at $109.5^{\\circ}$.\n\nTherefore, to account for the observed perfect tetrahedral geometry of the sigma-bond framework in $PO_{4}^{3-}$, VB theory requires $sp^{3}$ hybridization on phosphorus.\n\nHence, only Proposal C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1420314"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational concepts, we now explore molecules where the central atom accommodates more than the standard octet of electrons. The triiodide ion ($I_3^-$) is a classic example of a \"hypervalent\" species, which within the VB model requires the inclusion of valence $d$-orbitals in hybridization. This practice challenges you to integrate Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory with VB theory to determine not only the underlying electron-domain geometry but also the final molecular shape, a crucial skill for predicting the structures of more complex polyatomic ions [@problem_id:1420263].", "problem": "The triiodide ion, $I_3^-$, is a well-known polyatomic ion formed by the reaction of iodine with iodide ions.

For the ion $I_3^-$, the total number of valence electrons is $3 \\times 7 + 1 = 22$.\n\nA valid Lewis structure places one iodine as the central atom bonded to two terminal iodine atoms. To satisfy octets while accounting for the extra electron, the central iodine carries three lone pairs and forms two single bonds to the terminal iodines; each terminal iodine has three lone pairs. The steric number at the central iodine is therefore the sum of the number of $\\sigma$ bonds and lone pairs: $\\text{SN} = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nBy Valence Bond theory, a steric number of $5$ corresponds to $sp^3d$ hybridization on the central atom. By VSEPR, $5$ electron domains adopt a trigonal bipyramidal electron-domain geometry. Lone pair–lone pair repulsions are greater than lone pair–bond pair repulsions, which are greater than bond pair–bond pair repulsions; hence the three lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions to minimize repulsion, leaving the two bond pairs in the axial positions. This arrangement gives a linear molecular geometry for $I_3^-$.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is $sp^3d$ hybridization with a linear molecular geometry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1420263"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves beyond the idealized integer-based hybridization models to reflect chemical reality more accurately.
