No rounding is required.", "solution": "The task is to determine the bond order of the dicarbon molecule, $\\text{C}_{2}$.\nFirst, we establish the number of valence electrons to be placed in the molecular orbitals. A neutral carbon atom ($\\text{C}$) has the atomic electron configuration $1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{2}$. The valence electrons are those in the $n=2$ shell. Therefore, each carbon atom contributes $2+2=4$ valence electrons. For the diatomic molecule $\\text{C}_{2}$, the total number of valence electrons is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nNext, we fill the valence molecular orbitals with these $8$ electrons according to the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule, using the provided energy ordering:\n$$\n\\sigma_{2s} < \\sigma^{*}_{2s} < \\pi_{2p_{x}} = \\pi_{2p_{y}} < \\sigma_{2p_{z}} < \\pi^{*}_{2p_{x}} = \\pi^{*}_{2p_{y}} < \\sigma^{*}_{2p_{z}}\n$$\nFollowing this order:\n$1$. The $\\sigma_{2s}$ bonding orbital is filled with $2$ electrons.\n$2$. The $\\sigma^{*}_{2s}$ antibonding orbital is filled with $2$ electrons.\n$3$. The degenerate $\\pi_{2p_{x}}$ and $\\pi_{2p_{y}}$ bonding orbitals are filled next. We have $8 - 2 - 2 = 4$ electrons remaining. These $4$ electrons will completely fill the two $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals.\n\nThe resulting ground-state valence electron configuration for $\\text{C}_{2}$ is:\n$$\n(\\sigma_{2s})^{2} (\\sigma^{*}_{2s})^{2} (\\pi_{2p_{x}})^{2} (\\pi_{2p_{y}})^{2} \\quad \\text{or, more compactly,} \\quad (\\sigma_{2s})^{2} (\\sigma^{*}_{2s})^{2} (\\pi_{2p})^{4}\n$$\nThe bond order is defined as one-half the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals ($N_{b}$) and the number of electrons in antibonding orbitals ($N_{a}$):\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (N_{b} - N_{a})\n$$\nFrom the electron configuration, we count the bonding and antibonding electrons:\n- Electrons in bonding orbitals ($\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\pi_{2p_{x}}$, $\\pi_{2p_{y}}$): $N_{b} = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n- Electrons in antibonding orbitals ($\\sigma^{*}_{2s}$): $N_{a} = 2$.\n- The higher-energy orbitals ($\\sigma_{2p_{z}}$, $\\pi^{*}_{2p}$, $\\sigma^{*}_{2p_{z}}$) are unoccupied.\n\nSubstituting these values into the bond order formula:\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (6 - 2) = \\frac{1}{2} (4) = 2\n$$\nThe bond order of $\\text{C}_{2}$ is $2$.\n\nThe problem also requires a brief qualitative explanation for the strong double bond character. A bond order of $2$ corresponds to a double bond. The composition of this bond is noteworthy. The contribution from the $2s$-derived orbitals involves $2$ bonding electrons in $\\sigma_{2s}$ and $2$ antibonding electrons in $\\sigma^{*}_{2s}$, resulting in a net bond order contribution of $\\frac{1}{2} (2 - 2) = 0$. The entire bonding interaction arises from the $p$-orbitals. Specifically, there are $4$ electrons in the $\\pi_{2p}$ bonding orbitals and $0$ electrons in the $\\sigma_{2p_{z}}$ bonding orbital and any $2p$-derived antibonding orbitals. The bond order contribution from the $2p$ shell is therefore $\\frac{1}{2}(4-0) = 2$. This indicates that the double bond in $\\text{C}_{2}$ is composed of two $\\pi$ bonds, with no net $\\sigma$ bond contribution. The presence of two full bonding $\\pi$ orbitals results in a strong covalent interaction, classifying it as a double bond, despite the unusual absence of a net $\\sigma$ component which is typically present in double bonds (e.g., in ethene, $\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{4}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2465017"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple diatomics, the LCAO method truly shines when applied to delocalized $\\pi$ systems using the Hückel approximation.
