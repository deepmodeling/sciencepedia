One such process involves the capture of a free-moving electron by a neutral dinitrogen molecule ($N_2$), the most abundant component of our atmosphere, to form the dinitrogen anion ($N_2^-$). The stability and chemical reactivity of this newly formed species depend critically on the nature of its chemical bond.\n\nUsing molecular orbital theory for second-period homonuclear diatomic molecules, analyze the dinitrogen anion. A neutral nitrogen atom has the electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^3$.

The bond order is a measure of the number of chemical bonds between two atoms and is calculated using the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\text{Number of bonding electrons} - \\text{Number of antibonding electrons})\n$$\nA higher bond order corresponds to a stronger and shorter bond.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the neutral $N_2$ molecule. A nitrogen atom has 7 electrons. Therefore, the $N_2$ molecule has a total of $7 + 7 = 14$ electrons. We fill the molecular orbitals according to the aufbau principle and the specified energy ordering for $N_2$: $\\sigma_{1s}, \\sigma^*_{1s}, \\sigma_{2s}, \\sigma^*_{2s}, \\pi_{2p}, \\sigma_{2p}, \\pi^*_{2p}, \\sigma^*_{2p}$.\n\nThe electron configuration for $N_2$ with 14 electrons is:\n$$\n(\\sigma_{1s})^2 (\\sigma^*_{1s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma^*_{2s})^2 (\\pi_{2p})^4 (\\sigma_{2p})^2\n$$\nNow, we count the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals. Bonding orbitals are those without an asterisk (*), and antibonding orbitals are those with an asterisk.\nNumber of bonding electrons ($N_b$) = 2 (from $\\sigma_{1s}$) + 2 (from $\\sigma_{2s}$) + 4 (from $\\pi_{2p}$) + 2 (from $\\sigma_{2p}$) = 10.\nNumber of antibonding electrons ($N_a$) = 2 (from $\\sigma^*_{1s}$) + 2 (from $\\sigma^*_{2s}$) = 4.\n\nThe bond order of $N_2$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order}_{N_2} = \\frac{1}{2}(10 - 4) = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n$$\nThis corresponds to the well-known triple bond in dinitrogen.\n\nNext, we analyze the dinitrogen anion, $N_2^-$. This ion has one additional electron compared to the neutral molecule, for a total of $14 + 1 = 15$ electrons. This 15th electron is added to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the neutral $N_2$ molecule. Based on the configuration of $N_2$, the next available orbital is the $\\pi^*_{2p}$ antibonding orbital.\n\nThe electron configuration for $N_2^-$ with 15 electrons is:\n$$\n(\\sigma_{1s})^2 (\\sigma^*_{1s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma^*_{2s})^2 (\\pi_{2p})^4 (\\sigma_{2p})^2 (\\pi^*_{2p})^1\n$$\nNow, we count the electrons for $N_2^-$:\nNumber of bonding electrons ($N_b$) = 2 (from $\\sigma_{1s}$) + 2 (from $\\sigma_{2s}$) + 4 (from $\\pi_{2p}$) + 2 (from $\\sigma_{2p}$) = 10.\nNumber of antibonding electrons ($N_a$) = 2 (from $\\sigma^*_{1s}$) + 2 (from $\\sigma^*_{2s}$) + 1 (from $\\pi^*_{2p}$) = 5.\n\nThe bond order of $N_2^-$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Bond Order}_{N_2^-} = \\frac{1}{2}(10 - 5) = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n$$\nSo, the bond order of the $N_2^-$ anion is 2.5.\n\nFinally, we compare the bond strengths. The bond order of $N_2$ is 3, while the bond order of $N_2^-$ is 2.5. Since the bond order of $N_2^-$ is lower than that of $N_2$ ($2.5 < 3$), the bond in the $N_2^-$ anion is weaker than the bond in the neutral $N_2$ molecule. This is because the additional electron occupies an antibonding orbital, which destabilizes and weakens the overall bond.\n\nCombining our findings: the bond order of $N_2^-$ is 2.5, and its bond is weaker than in $N_2$.
