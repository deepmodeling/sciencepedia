By definition, this is the internuclear distance at which the potential energy $V(R)$ is at a minimum. To find this minimum, we must take the derivative of $V(R)$ with respect to $R$ and set it to zero.\n\nThe potential energy function is given by:\n$$V(R) = D_0 \\left( \\exp(-2a(R-R_0)) - C \\exp(-a(R-R_0)) \\right)$$\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to $R$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dR} = D_0 \\left( \\frac{d}{dR}\\exp(-2a(R-R_0)) - C \\frac{d}{dR}\\exp(-a(R-R_0)) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dR} = D_0 \\left( -2a\\exp(-2a(R-R_0)) - C(-a)\\exp(-a(R-R_0)) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dR} = aD_0 \\left( -2\\exp(-2a(R-R_0)) + C\\exp(-a(R-R_0)) \\right)$$\n\nWe set the derivative to zero to find the extremum.
