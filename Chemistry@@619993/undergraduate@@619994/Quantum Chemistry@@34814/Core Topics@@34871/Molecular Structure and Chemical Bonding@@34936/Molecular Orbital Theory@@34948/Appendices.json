Each boron atom has $Z=5$, so the B₂ molecule has 10 electrons.

In Scheme A, the ordering places $\\sigma_{2p_z}$ below the degenerate set $(\\pi_{2p_x}, \\pi_{2p_y})$. The two remaining electrons therefore occupy $\\sigma_{2p_z}$ as $\\sigma_{2p_z}^2$, resulting in zero unpaired electrons (a diamagnetic state). This contradicts the experimental observation that B₂ is paramagnetic, so Scheme A cannot describe the magnetic properties of B₂.\n\nIn Scheme B, the ordering places the degenerate set $(\\pi_{2p_x}, \\pi_{2p_y})$ below $\\sigma_{2p_z}$. By the Aufbau principle and Hund’s rule, the two remaining electrons occupy these degenerate $\\pi$ orbitals singly with parallel spins, giving $(\\pi_{2p_x})^1(\\pi_{2p_y})^1$ and hence two unpaired electrons. This predicts paramagnetism, in agreement with experiment.\n\nAs a consistency check, the bond order computed from the valence levels in Scheme B is\n$$\n\\text{bond order}=\\frac{N_{\\text{bond}}-N_{\\text{antibond}}}{2}=\\frac{2-0}{2}=1,\n$$\nsince the $2s$ block contributes zero net bond order and the two electrons in the bonding $\\pi$ orbitals contribute $2$ to $N_{\\text{bond}}$.

This problem delves into the case of the methane radical cation ($CH_4^+$), a species with a degenerate electronic ground state. You will apply the Jahn-Teller theorem to predict how this electronic degeneracy drives a geometric distortion, demonstrating the profound link between a molecule's electronic structure and its stable geometry [@problem_id:2006197].", "problem": "Methane ($CH_4$) in its ground electronic state possesses a stable tetrahedral geometry, corresponding to the $T_d$ point group. A molecular orbital (MO) analysis reveals its valence electron configuration is $(a_1)^2(t_2)^6$, where the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is the triply degenerate set of $t_2$ orbitals. Consider the process of one-electron oxidation, which removes an electron from the HOMO to form the methane radical cation, $CH_4^+$. This leaves the cation in a triply degenerate electronic state of $T_2$ symmetry.\n\nThe Jahn-Teller theorem predicts that any non-linear molecule in a degenerate electronic state will spontaneously distort its geometry to remove the degeneracy and lower its energy. The nature of this distortion determines the new, lower-symmetry point group of the molecule and how the degenerate electronic state splits. For the $CH_4^+$ cation, three plausible distortion pathways from the initial $T_d$ geometry are:\n\n1.  Distortion to a $C_{3v}$ geometry, which would split the $T_2$ electronic state into two new states with $A_1$ and $E$ symmetry.\n2.

One-electron oxidation removes an electron from the HOMO, leaving a hole in the triply degenerate $t_2$ set, so the electronic state of $CH_4^+$ is an orbitally degenerate $^2T_2$ state.\n\nBy the Jahn-Teller theorem, any non-linear molecule in an orbitally degenerate electronic state is unstable to a distortion that lowers the symmetry and lifts the degeneracy. For a $T_2$ electronic state in $T_d$, the linear Jahn-Teller active vibrational modes are those irreducible representations $\\Gamma_{vib}$ that appear in the symmetric direct product of $T_2$. Using $T_2 \\otimes T_2 = A_1 \\oplus E \\oplus T_1 \\oplus T_2$, the Jahn-Teller active modes are $E$ and $T_2$. Distortions along these modes lead to lower-symmetry structures in which the $T_2$ electronic state splits according to subgroup correlations.\n\nThe three candidate distortions and their splittings are:\n- To $C_{3v}$: $T_2 \\to A_1 \\oplus E$ (one singlet plus one doubly degenerate level).\n- To $D_{2d}$: $T_2 \\to B_2 \\oplus E$ (one singlet plus one doubly degenerate level).\n- To $C_{2v}$: $T_2 \\to A_1 \\oplus B_1 \\oplus B_2$ (three nondegenerate levels).\n\nThe problem specifies the principle that the most effective stabilization is achieved by a distortion that completely removes the electronic degeneracy. Among the listed possibilities, only the $C_{2v}$ distortion fully lifts the degeneracy of the $T_2$ state into three singlets. In contrast, both $C_{3v}$ and $D_{2d}$ retain an $E$ doublet, leaving residual orbital degeneracy that would drive further distortion. Option $A$ ($T_d$) contradicts the Jahn-Teller prediction for an orbitally degenerate state, and $D_{4h}$ is not a plausible Jahn-Teller product subgroup for $T_d$ in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most probable point group for the ground-state geometry of $CH_4^+$ under the stated criterion is $C_{2v}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2006197"}]}
