The central oxygen atom has two bonding pairs with hydrogen atoms and two non-bonding lone pairs of electrons. According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, these four electron domains arrange themselves in a tetrahedral geometry to minimize repulsion, suggesting $sp^3$ hybridization for the oxygen atom. This model, in its simplest form, implies the formation of four energetically and spatially equivalent $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals, which would predict an H-O-H bond angle of exactly 109.5°.

The quantum-mechanical explanation proceeds by considering how hybridization adjusts to minimize total energy:\n- Orbitals with higher s-character are lower in energy and more compact (because s-functions are nodeless at the nucleus), stabilizing electron density localized on the central atom.\n- Nonbonding (lone-pair) electrons are fully localized on oxygen and thus gain maximal stabilization by occupying orbitals with increased s-character.\n- To conserve orthogonality and the total s-character budget at the atom, if the lone-pair hybrids take more s-character, the bonding hybrids must become correspondingly richer in p-character (i.e., have a larger effective $n$ in $sp^{n}$).\n\nThe geometry follows from the relation between hybrid composition and inter-orbital angle.
