The +1 formal charge resides on the central carbon atom, and all three nitrogen atoms are neutral.", "solution": "We analyze the guanidinium cation $[C(NH_2)_3]^+$ using Lewis structures and formal charges, following Valence Bond resonance principles: major resonance contributors must (i) be valid Lewis structures, (ii) maximize octets for second-row atoms, and (iii) minimize formal charges.\n\nUse the formal charge formula for an atom:\n$$\n\\text{FC} = V - \\left(N_{\\text{nonbond}} + \\frac{1}{2}N_{\\text{bond}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of valence electrons, $N_{\\text{nonbond}}$ is the number of nonbonding electrons, and $N_{\\text{bond}}$ is the number of bonding electrons.\n\nConsider a resonance contributor in which the central carbon is double-bonded to one nitrogen and single-bonded to the other two nitrogens. Compute formal charges:\n\n- Central carbon: it has one double bond and two single bonds, i.e., four bonds, no lone pairs. Then $N_{\\text{bond}}=8$, $N_{\\text{nonbond}}=0$, and $V=4$. Thus\n$$\n\\text{FC}(C)=4-\\left(0+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 8\\right)=4-4=0.\n$$\n- The nitrogen with the double bond: it is bound to carbon via a double bond and to two hydrogens via single bonds, totaling four bonds and no lone pairs to satisfy an octet. For nitrogen, $V=5$, $N_{\\text{bond}}=8$, $N_{\\text{nonbond}}=0$, hence\n$$\n\\text{FC}(N_{\\text{double}})=5-\\left(0+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 8\\right)=5-4=+1.\n$$\n- Each single-bonded nitrogen: it is singly bonded to carbon and to two hydrogens, with one lone pair to complete an octet. Then $N_{\\text{bond}}=6$, $N_{\\text{nonbond}}=2$, $V=5$, so\n$$\n\\text{FC}(N_{\\text{single}})=5-\\left(2+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6\\right)=5-(2+3)=0.\n$$\n\nThus, in this contributor, the central carbon is neutral, the double-bonded nitrogen bears $+1$, and the other two nitrogens are neutral. This structure satisfies octets for all second-row atoms and has the smallest possible magnitude of formal charge (only a single $+1$). By symmetry, there are exactly three equivalent such contributors, corresponding to placing the C=N double bond to any one of the three nitrogens. This directly matches option A.\n\nNow exclude the other options:\n\n- Option B proposes a single structure with carbon single-bonded to all three nitrogens and carrying the $+1$ charge. In that structure, carbon has only three bonds (six electrons), i.e., an incomplete octet, which makes it a less significant contributor. Major contributors should maximize octet completion. Therefore B is not the complete set of major contributors.\n\n- Option C assigns $+1$ on carbon and $-1$ on one nitrogen with a double bond present. The stated charge distribution is inconsistent with the formal charge calculations above. In particular, with a double bond to one nitrogen, carbon has four bonds and is neutral, not $+1$. Furthermore, a single-bonded $\\mathrm{NH_{2}}$ nitrogen attached to carbon cannot carry $-1$ while maintaining a valid octet with three single bonds; achieving $\\text{FC}=-1$ for nitrogen requires two bonds and two lone pairs, which is incompatible with an $\\mathrm{NH_{2}}$ unit also bonded to carbon. Hence C is invalid.\n\n- Option D describes constitutional isomers involving proton transfer (e.g., $[H_2N-C(H)=N-NH_3]^+$), which change atom connectivity. Resonance structures must have the same connectivity and only differ in placement of electrons. Thus D does not describe resonance contributors.\n\n- Option E claims that in the double-bonded set the $+1$ charge resides on carbon while all nitrogens are neutral. As shown, with one double bond and two single bonds, carbon’s formal charge is zero, not $+1$. Hence E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of three equivalent, major resonance contributors is correctly described by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1391301"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond two-dimensional drawings, a deeper understanding of resonance requires us to consider the three-dimensional arrangement of atomic orbitals. This exercise challenges you to analyze why some molecules with multiple double bonds exhibit resonance while others do not. By comparing a conjugated system with the cumulated diene allene ($H_2C=C=CH_2$), you will discover the crucial role that parallel $p$-orbital alignment plays in enabling electron delocalization, revealing the geometric basis of resonance [@problem_id:1391312].", "problem": "Consider the molecule allene, which has the chemical structure $H_2C=C=CH_2$.

Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why allene does not exhibit the extensive pi-electron delocalization characteristic of conjugated systems?\n\nA. All carbon atoms in allene are sp²-hybridized, but steric hindrance between the terminal hydrogen atoms twists the molecule, breaking the pi-system conjugation.\n\nB. The central carbon atom in allene is sp-hybridized, utilizing two orthogonal p-orbitals to form two separate pi bonds with the sp²-hybridized terminal carbons. This perpendicular arrangement of the two pi systems prevents continuous overlap across the carbon backbone.\n\nC. Allene is a fully conjugated system because the sequence of double bonds allows for resonance structures like ${}^{+}CH_2-C^{-}=CH_2$, which significantly lowers the overall energy of the molecule through delocalization.\n\nD. The terminal carbon atoms in allene are sp-hybridized and the central carbon is sp²-hybridized. This hybridization mismatch prevents the formation of a stable, delocalized molecular orbital.\n\nE.

In 1,3-butadiene, each of the four carbon atoms is $sp^{2}$-hybridized and contributes one unhybridized $p$ orbital; these four $p$ orbitals are all parallel, allowing continuous overlap and formation of delocalized $\\pi$ bonding across the chain.\n\nFor allene $H_{2}C=C=CH_{2}$, the central carbon is $sp$-hybridized because it forms two $\\sigma$ bonds along a straight line to the terminal carbons. This leaves two unhybridized $p$ orbitals on the central carbon, which we may denote $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$, and these are orthogonal. Each terminal carbon is $sp^{2}$-hybridized and carries one unhybridized $p$ orbital. One of the central carbon’s $p$ orbitals overlaps with the $p$ orbital on one terminal carbon to form one $\\pi$ bond, while the other central $p$ orbital overlaps with the other terminal carbon’s $p$ orbital to form the other $\\pi$ bond. Because the two central $p$ orbitals are perpendicular, the two terminal $p$ orbitals that they overlap with are also arranged in mutually perpendicular planes. Consequently, the two $\\pi$ systems are orthogonal and do not overlap with each other; there is no continuous, co-planar chain of parallel $p$ orbitals spanning all three carbons. This orthogonality fundamentally prevents the extensive $\\pi$-electron delocalization characteristic of conjugated systems.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because not all carbons in allene are $sp^{2}$-hybridized, and the orthogonal arrangement arises from the $sp$ central carbon’s two perpendicular $p$ orbitals rather than steric twisting.\n- B correctly states that the central carbon is $sp$-hybridized, uses two orthogonal $p$ orbitals to form two separate $\\pi$ bonds, and that this perpendicular arrangement prevents continuous overlap across the carbon backbone.\n- C is incorrect because allene is not fully conjugated; charge-separated resonance forms such as ${}^{+}CH_{2}-C^{-}=CH_2$ are not dominant contributors and do not reflect extensive delocalization across all three carbons.\n- D is incorrect because the terminal carbons are $sp^{2}$ and the central is $sp$, not the reverse.\n- E is incorrect because invoking a large electronegativity difference for the $sp$ carbon to explain localization is not the primary or fundamental reason; the key reason is orbital orthogonality.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is given by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1391312"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a scientific theory lies in its ability to make testable predictions.

Hence, conjugated dienes are more stable (lower $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$) than isolated dienes with the same substitution.\n- Alkene substitution and hyperconjugation further stabilize double bonds. Disubstituted alkenes are more stabilized than monosubstituted ones.\n- For stereoisomers, the trans (E) alkene is typically more stable than the cis (Z) due to reduced steric repulsion, hence $(E)$ is lower in $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$ than $(Z)$.\n\nApply these to the candidates:\n- A. 1,4-Pentadiene, $CH_2=CH-CH_2-CH=CH_2$, is an isolated diene with two terminal, monosubstituted double bonds. It lacks conjugative stabilization between the double bonds and has the least substitution, making it the least stabilized (largest $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$).\n- B.

(E)-1,3-Pentadiene is the most stable among the dienes due to both conjugation and the more favorable trans geometry, giving the smallest $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}$ of A–C.\n- D. Pentane has no double bonds; its “complete hydrogenation to pentane” consumes zero hydrogen and has\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text{hyd}}^{\\circ}(\\text{pentane})=0,\n$$\nso it is not the most exothermic.\n\nRanking by stability (most to least stable): C $>$ B $>$ A.
