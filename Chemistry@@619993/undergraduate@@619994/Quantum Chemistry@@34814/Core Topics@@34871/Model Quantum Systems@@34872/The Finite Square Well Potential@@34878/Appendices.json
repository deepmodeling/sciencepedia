The search for a root $x$ is confined to the range $[(n-1)\\pi/2, \\min(n\\pi/2, \\zeta)]$.\n\n3.  **Numerical Method**: A robust numerical root-finding algorithm is required. The Brent-Dekker method (available in SciPy as `brentq`) is an excellent choice. It is a hybrid bracketing method that guarantees convergence if the function values at the endpoints of the search interval have opposite signs.\n    - For even parity states, the function $f_e(x)$ changes sign from negative to positive over the interval $(m\\pi, m\\pi+\\pi/2)$, where $m = (n-1)/2$.\n    - For odd parity states, the function $f_o(x)$ changes sign from negative to positive over the interval $(m\\pi+\\pi/2, (m+1)\\pi)$, where $m=(n-2)/2$.\n    This sign-change property ensures the reliability of the `brentq` method. To avoid singularities of $\\tan(x)$ and $\\cot(x)$ at the interval boundaries, the search bracket is slightly contracted, for example, by a small amount $\\epsilon$.\n\n4.  **Energy Calculation and Finalization**: For each root $x_n$ found, the corresponding energy $E_n$ is calculated in joules using the formula derived earlier.
