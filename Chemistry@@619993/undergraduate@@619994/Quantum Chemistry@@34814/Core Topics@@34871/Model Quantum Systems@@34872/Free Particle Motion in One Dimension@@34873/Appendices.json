The probability current, $j(x)$, is a crucial concept that quantifies this flow. This exercise provides a foundational understanding by asking you to calculate the current for a real-valued standing wave, which models a particle in certain idealized systems. By analyzing this specific case [@problem_id:1370080], you'll uncover the fundamental difference between a state with no net motion and a traveling wave that carries momentum.", "problem": "In certain idealized one-dimensional quantum systems, such as an electron confined within a very long but finite nanowire, the electron's state can be approximated as a standing wave. Consider a free particle of mass $m$ in one dimension whose quantum state is described by the real-valued spatial wave function $\\psi(x) = A \\cos(kx)$, where $A$ is a real normalization constant and $k$ is a positive real constant known as the wave number.\n\nThe probability current density, $j(x)$, quantifies the flow of probability. For a stationary state with spatial wave function $\\psi(x)$, it is given by the formula:\n$$j(x) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} \\left( \\psi^*(x) \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} - \\psi(x) \\frac{d\\psi^*(x)}{dx} \\right)$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $i$ is the imaginary unit, and $\\psi^*(x)$ is the complex conjugate of $\\psi(x)$.\n\nCalculate the probability current density $j(x)$ for this particle.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability current density $j(x)$ for a particle described by the spatial wave function $\\psi(x) = A \\cos(kx)$.

The given wave function is $\\psi(x) = A \\cos(kx)$. Since $A$ and $k$ are real constants, and the cosine function is real-valued for real arguments, the entire wave function $\\psi(x)$ is real. For any real function, its complex conjugate is the function itself.\nTherefore,\n$$\\psi^*(x) = \\psi(x) = A \\cos(kx)$$\n\nNext, we need to find the derivative of $\\psi(x)$ with respect to $x$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( A \\cos(kx) \\right) = A \\cdot (-\\sin(kx)) \\cdot k = -Ak \\sin(kx)$$\n\nSince $\\psi(x)$ is real, the derivative of its complex conjugate is the same as the derivative of the function itself:\n$$\\frac{d\\psi^*(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = -Ak \\sin(kx)$$\n\nNow we substitute these expressions back into the formula for $j(x)$:\n$$j(x) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} \\left( (A \\cos(kx)) (-Ak \\sin(kx)) - (A \\cos(kx)) (-Ak \\sin(kx)) \\right)$$\n\nLet's examine the two terms inside the parentheses.\nThe first term is $\\psi^*(x) \\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} = -A^2 k \\cos(kx) \\sin(kx)$.\nThe second term is $\\psi(x) \\frac{d\\psi^*(x)}{dx} = -A^2 k \\cos(kx) \\sin(kx)$.\n\nThe expression inside the parentheses is the difference between these two identical terms:\n$$j(x) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} \\left( (-A^2 k \\cos(kx) \\sin(kx)) - (-A^2 k \\cos(kx) \\sin(kx)) \\right)$$\n$$j(x) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi} (0)$$\n$$j(x) = 0$$\n\nThe result is that the probability current density is zero for all positions $x$. This result has a clear physical interpretation. The probability current density $j(x)$ describes the net flow of probability across the point $x$. A standing wave, like $\\cos(kx)$, can be viewed as a superposition of two traveling waves with the same amplitude moving in opposite directions: $\\cos(kx) = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{ikx} + e^{-ikx})$. The wave $e^{ikx}$ represents a particle moving to the right (positive $x$-direction), and it generates a positive probability current. The wave $e^{-ikx}$ represents a particle moving to the left (negative $x$-direction), and it generates a negative probability current of the same magnitude. For a standing wave, the probability flow to the right is perfectly balanced by the probability flow to the left at every point $x$. Consequently, there is no net flow of probability, and the probability current density is zero everywhere.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1370080"}, {"introduction": "A free particle localized in space is described by a wave packet, a superposition of momentum eigenstates.
