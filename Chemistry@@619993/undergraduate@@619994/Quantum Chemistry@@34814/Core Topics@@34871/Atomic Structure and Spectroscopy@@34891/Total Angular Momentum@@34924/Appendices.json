The total number of states for such a system is the product of the number of states available to each individual atom.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of quantum states for a single atom whose state is characterized by a total angular momentum quantum number $J$. For a given value of $J$, the orientation of the total angular momentum vector in space is quantized. The projection of the total angular momentum onto a chosen axis (conventionally the z-axis) is given by the magnetic quantum number, $m_J$. The possible values of $m_J$ range from $-J$ to $+J$ in integer steps.\n$$m_J = -J, -J+1, \\dots, J-1, J$$\nThe number of possible values for $m_J$ determines the degeneracy of the energy level.
