To do this, we need to analyze their structure based on their quantum numbers. The key features to compare are size, number of angular nodes, and number of radial nodes.\n\nThe designation of an orbital provides its principal quantum number, $n$, and its angular momentum quantum number, $l$. The letter 'p' corresponds to $l=1$. The subscript 'x' indicates the directional orientation of the orbital along the x-axis.\n\nFirst, let's establish the general rules for determining the number of nodes in a hydrogenic orbital:\n- The total number of nodes is given by the formula $n-1$.\n- The number of angular nodes is equal to the angular momentum quantum number, $l$. These nodes are planar or conical surfaces.\n- The number of radial nodes is given by the formula $n - l - 1$. These nodes are spherical surfaces.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the $2p_x$ orbital:\n- Principal quantum number, $n=2$.\n- Angular momentum quantum number, $l=1$ (since it is a p-orbital).\n- Total number of nodes = $n-1 = 2-1 = 1$.\n- Number of angular nodes = $l = 1$. For a $p_x$ orbital, this is the y-z plane where $x=0$.\n- Number of radial nodes = $n - l - 1 = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nSo, the $2p_x$ orbital has a characteristic dumbbell shape with two lobes of opposite phase lying along the x-axis, separated by a single angular nodal plane (the y-z plane). It has no spherical (radial) nodes.\n\nNext, let's apply the same rules to the $3p_x$ orbital:\n- Principal quantum number, $n=3$.\n- Angular momentum quantum number, $l=1$ (since it is a p-orbital).\n- Total number of nodes = $n-1 = 3-1 = 2$.\n- Number of angular nodes = $l = 1$. Just like the $2p_x$ orbital, this is the y-z plane.\n- Number of radial nodes = $n - l - 1 = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, the $3p_x$ orbital also has its main lobes oriented along the x-axis and is separated by a single angular nodal plane (the y-z plane). However, it has one additional node, which is a radial node. This radial node is a spherical surface that separates an inner region of the orbital from an outer region. The overall shape is a larger dumbbell containing a smaller, nested dumbbell of opposite phase. The $3p_x$ orbital is also significantly larger in spatial extent than the $2p_x$ orbital because of its higher principal quantum number, $n=3$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n- **A. The $3p_x$ orbital has two angular nodes and one radial node, whereas the $2p_x$ orbital has one angular node and no radial nodes.** This is incorrect. Both orbitals are p-orbitals ($l=1$) and therefore both have exactly one angular node.\n- **B. The $3p_x$ orbital is identical in shape to the $2p_x$ orbital, only larger in size. Both orbitals consist of two lobes of opposite phase separated by a single nodal plane, and neither possesses a radial node.** This is incorrect because it fails to account for the radial node in the $3p_x$ orbital.\n- **C. Both the $2p_x$ and $3p_x$ orbitals possess a single angular nodal plane. The key difference is that the $3p_x$ orbital, in addition to being larger, contains one spherical radial node which is not present in the $2p_x$ orbital.** This statement is entirely correct. It accurately identifies that both have one angular node, and correctly states the difference in size and the presence of one radial node in the $3p_x$ orbital.\n- **D. The primary difference is the number of lobes. The $2p_x$ orbital has two lobes along the x-axis, while the $3p_x$ orbital has a more complex shape with four lobes.** This is incorrect. The number of lobes is determined by the shape, which is related to $l$. Both are p-orbitals and have a fundamental two-lobe structure. Four-lobed structures are characteristic of d-orbitals ($l=2$).\n- **E. The $2p_x$ orbital has one radial node and one angular node. The $3p_x$ orbital has two radial nodes and one angular node.** This is incorrect. It misstates the number of radial nodes for both orbitals. The $2p_x$ has 0 radial nodes, and the $3p_x$ has 1 radial node.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that provides a completely accurate comparison is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1371263"}, {"introduction": "After learning how quantum numbers dictate orbital structure, we can challenge ourselves to work in reverse. A powerful graphical tool in quantum chemistry is the radial distribution function (RDF), $P(r)$, which reveals the probability of finding an electron at a certain distance from the nucleus.

The overall shape of this function is determined by the number of radial nodes present in the wavefunction.\n\nA radial node is a spherical surface (at a specific radius $r>0$) where the radial wavefunction $R_{n,l}(r)$ is zero, and thus the probability of finding the electron is zero. The radial distribution function $P(r)$ will also be zero at these nodes.\n\nThe function $P(r)$ is zero at $r=0$ (due to the $r^2$ term) and approaches zero as $r \\to \\infty$. Between these points, the function rises and falls. Each time the function passes through zero at a radial node, it must have had a maximum before the node and will have another maximum after the node (before decaying to zero at infinity or hitting another node).\n\nThe number of local maxima in the radial distribution function, $P(r)$, is directly related to the number of radial nodes. Let $N_{rad}$ be the number of radial nodes.\n- An orbital with $N_{rad} = 0$ will have its RDF start at 0, rise to a single maximum, and then decay to 0. It has 1 maximum.\n- An orbital with $N_{rad} = 1$ will have its RDF start at 0, rise to a maximum, fall to 0 at the node, rise to a second maximum, and then decay to 0. It has 2 maxima.\n- An orbital with $N_{rad} = k$ will have $k+1$ maxima.\n\nThe problem states that there are exactly two local maxima in $P(r)$. Using the relationship derived above:\nNumber of maxima = $N_{rad} + 1$\n$$2 = N_{rad} + 1$$\nSolving for the number of radial nodes, we find:\n$$N_{rad} = 1$$\nSo, the orbital in question must have exactly one radial node.\n\nThe number of radial nodes for an orbital with quantum numbers $n$ and $l$ is given by the formula:\n$$N_{rad} = n - l - 1$$\nWe can now set this expression equal to 1:\n$$n - l - 1 = 1$$\n$$n - l = 2$$\nThis equation relates the possible values of $n$ and $l$. We are looking for the minimum possible integer values that satisfy this relation, subject to the rules governing quantum numbers.

We can rearrange the equation to $l = n-2$.\nTo find the minimum possible $n$, let's test integer values of $n$ starting from 1:\n- If $n=1$: Then $l = 1-2 = -1$. This is not a valid value for $l$, as $l$ must be non-negative ($l \\ge 0$).\n- If $n=2$: Then $l = 2-2 = 0$. This is a valid set of quantum numbers. For $n=2$, the allowed values of $l$ are $0$ and $1$. Since $l=0$ is allowed, the pair $(n=2, l=0)$ is a valid solution. This corresponds to the 2s orbital.\n- If $n=3$: Then $l = 3-2 = 1$. This is a valid set of quantum numbers. For $n=3$, the allowed values of $l$ are $0, 1, 2$. Since $l=1$ is allowed, the pair $(n=3, l=1)$ is a valid solution. This corresponds to the 3p orbital.\n\nWe are asked for the *minimum possible* value for the principal quantum number $n$. Comparing the valid solutions, the smallest value for $n$ we found is $n=2$. The corresponding value for the angular momentum quantum number is $l=0$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible values for the quantum numbers are $n=2$ and $l=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1371305"}, {"introduction": "Beyond radial features, the angular part of the wavefunction governs an orbital's iconic shape and orientation.
