This first exercise serves as a crucial check on our understanding of how quantum states are accounted for when new interactions are introduced. You will verify that while spin-orbit coupling lifts degeneracy and splits energy levels, the total number of available quantum states for a given orbital angular momentum $l$ is conserved [@problem_id:1368848]. This principle of state conservation is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.", "problem": "In the quantum theory of a hydrogen-like atom, a state is characterized by several quantum numbers. In a simplified model that neglects relativistic effects, an energy level corresponding to a specific orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ has a degeneracy that accounts for both the possible spatial orientations of the orbital (described by the magnetic quantum number $m_l$) and the electron's spin (described by the spin magnetic quantum number $m_s$).\n\nA more refined model includes the effect of spin-orbit coupling, which is a relativistic correction. This interaction lifts some of the degeneracy, causing the original level to split into distinct, closely-spaced 'fine-structure' sublevels. These sublevels are no longer described by $l$ and $s$ separately, but by a total angular momentum quantum number $j$. For an electron (which has a spin quantum number $s=1/2$) in an orbital with quantum number $l > 0$, the quantum number $j$ can take the values $l+1/2$ and $l-1/2$. If $l=0$, the only possible value is $j=1/2$. Each of these fine-structure sublevels, characterized by a specific $j$, itself has a degeneracy of $2j+1$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical hydrogen-like atom where the single electron has been excited to a state in an H-orbital, which corresponds to the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=5$.

Each fine-structure sublevel with a given $j$ has degeneracy $2j+1$. Therefore, the total number of states obtained by splitting the original $l$ level is the sum of these degeneracies:\n$$\nN=\\sum_{j}(2j+1)=(2(l+\\tfrac{1}{2})+1)+(2(l-\\tfrac{1}{2})+1).\n$$\nEvaluate this expression symbolically:\n$$\nN=(2l+2)+(2l)=4l+2=2(2l+1).\n$$\nFor $l=5$ (H-orbital), this gives\n$$\nN=4\\cdot 5+2=22,\n$$\nequivalently $N=2(2\\cdot 5+1)=22$.
