Finally, compute the total number of distinct $M_J$ microstates across all these levels in LS coupling and report that total as a single integer. Provide only that final integer as your answer. Do not include any other information in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in quantum mechanics concerning the application of angular momentum coupling rules and the Pauli exclusion principle to a system of two equivalent electrons. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system under consideration is a $p^2$ configuration, which denotes two electrons in the same subshell. This means the electrons are equivalent, having the same principal quantum number $n$ and the same orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. For identical fermions, the total wavefunction, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$, must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of the two particles.\n\nIn the Russell-Saunders (LS) coupling scheme, the total wavefunction is approximated as a product of a spatial part and a spin part: $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\Psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\times \\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$. For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, one of two conditions must be met:\n1. $\\Psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is symmetric and $\\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$ is antisymmetric.\n2. $\\Psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is antisymmetric and $\\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$ is symmetric.\n\nFirst, we determine the possible total spin $S$ and total orbital angular momentum $L$ by applying the rules of angular momentum addition.\nFor the two electrons, each has spin $s=1/2$. The possible values for the total spin $S$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n$$S = |s_1 - s_2|, \\dots, s_1 + s_2 = \\left|\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right|, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\implies S \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$\nThe spin multiplicity is $2S+1$.\n- For $S=0$, the multiplicity is $1$ (a singlet state), and the corresponding spin wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$ is antisymmetric under particle exchange.\n- For $S=1$, the multiplicity is $3$ (a triplet state), and the corresponding spin wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$ is symmetric under particle exchange.\n\nFor the orbital part, each electron has $l=1$. The possible values for the total orbital angular momentum $L$ are:\n$$L = |l_1 - l_2|, \\dots, l_1 + l_2 = |1-1|, \\dots, 1+1 \\implies L \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$$\nThe exchange symmetry of the spatial wavefunction for two equivalent $p$-electrons depends on the total orbital angular momentum $L$. It can be shown that:\n- For $L=0$ (S term) and $L=2$ (D term), the spatial wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is symmetric.\n- For $L=1$ (P term), the spatial wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is antisymmetric.\n\nNow, we combine these symmetries to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle:\n- If the spatial part is symmetric ($L \\in \\{0, 2\\}$), the spin part must be antisymmetric ($S=0$). This gives us the following allowed terms:\n  - $L=0, S=0 \\implies {}^1S$ term.\n  - $L=2, S=0 \\implies {}^1D$ term.\n- If the spatial part is antisymmetric ($L=1$), the spin part must be symmetric ($S=1$). This gives us the following allowed term:\n  - $L=1, S=1 \\implies {}^3P$ term.\n\nAny other combination is forbidden. For example, a ${}^3S$ term ($L=0, S=1$) would require a symmetric spatial part and a symmetric spin part, resulting in a forbidden symmetric total wavefunction. Similarly, a ${}^1P$ term ($L=1, S=0$) would require an antisymmetric spatial part and an antisymmetric spin part, also resulting in a forbidden symmetric total wavefunction. The derived allowed terms are thus ${}^1S$, ${}^3P$, and ${}^1D$, which confirms the premise of the problem statement.\n\nNext, we find the allowed values for the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ for each term. The value of $J$ is found by coupling $L$ and $S$:\n$$J = |L-S|, \\dots, L+S$$\n- For the ${}^1S$ term: $L=0, S=0 \\implies J=0$. The level is ${}^1S_0$.\n- For the ${}^1D$ term: $L=2, S=0 \\implies J=2$. The level is ${}^1D_2$.\n- For the ${}^3P$ term: $L=1, S=1 \\implies J = |1-1|, \\dots, 1+1 \\implies J \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The levels are ${}^3P_0$, ${}^3P_1$, and ${}^3P_2$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the total number of distinct microstates, which are distinguished by the projection of the total angular momentum, $M_J$. For a given level with total angular momentum $J$, there are $2J+1$ possible values of $M_J$, from $-J$ to $+J$. We sum this degeneracy over all allowed levels.\n- For the ${}^1S_0$ level ($J=0$): Number of states = $2(0)+1 = 1$.\n- For the ${}^1D_2$ level ($J=2$): Number of states = $2(2)+1 = 5$.\n- For the ${}^3P_0$ level ($J=0$): Number of states = $2(0)+1 = 1$.\n- For the ${}^3P_1$ level ($J=1$): Number of states = $2(1)+1 = 3$.\n- For the ${}^3P_2$ level ($J=2$): Number of states = $2(2)+1 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of distinct $M_J$ microstates is the sum of the degeneracies of all these levels:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = (2J_{{}^1S_0}+1) + (2J_{{}^1D_2}+1) + (2J_{{}^3P_0}+1) + (2J_{{}^3P_1}+1) + (2J_{{}^3P_2}+1)$$\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = 1 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 15$$\n\nAs a verification, the number of ways to place $N=2$ electrons into the $k=2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ available spin-orbitals of a $p$ subshell is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = \\binom{k}{N} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$$\nThe result is consistent. The total number of microstates for the $p^2$ configuration is $15$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$", "id": "2874603"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles for equivalent electrons, this exercise examines an electronically excited atom with non-equivalent electrons, specifically the $2p^5 3s^1$ configuration of neon.
