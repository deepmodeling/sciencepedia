An intuitive hypothesis might be that their valence electrons experience similar chemical environments. To investigate this, we can calculate the effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) experienced by a valence electron in each species. The effective nuclear charge is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a many-electron atom, which is a result of the attractive force of the nucleus being shielded by the repulsive forces of the other electrons.

The formula for effective nuclear charge is given by $Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S$, where $Z$ is the atomic number and $S$ is the shielding constant.\n\nFirst, we determine the electron configuration for both species. $Cl^-$ and Ar are isoelectronic.\nA neutral chlorine atom ($Z=17$) has the configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^5$. The chloride ion, $Cl^-$, gains one electron, so its configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$.\nA neutral argon atom ($Z=18$) has the configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$.\nBoth species have the same electron configuration.

This calculation is the same for both $Cl^-$ and Ar as they have identical electron configurations.\n1.  **Shielding from electrons in the same group $(3s, 3p)$**: There are 8 electrons in this group. For the electron of interest, the other 7 electrons in this group will contribute to shielding.\n    Contribution = $7 \\times 0.35 = 2.45$.\n2.  **Shielding from electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell**: The $n-1$ shell is the $n=2$ shell, which contains the $(2s, 2p)$ group.

So the answer is $(5.75, 6.75)$.\nThe calculation reveals that even though $Cl^-$ and Ar are isoelectronic, the valence electrons in Ar experience a significantly greater effective nuclear charge.
