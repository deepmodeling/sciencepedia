This exercise connects the familiar concept of electron configurations to the quantum mechanical description of an electron's orbital motion. By determining the magnitude of orbital angular momentum for an electron in a silicon atom, you will practice applying the core formula, $L = \\sqrt{l(l+1)}\\hbar$, which governs this intrinsic property [@problem_id:1389281].", "problem": "A neutral silicon (Si) atom in its ground electronic state is a fundamental component of modern semiconductor devices. The atomic number of silicon is 14. According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, electrons occupy specific orbitals, each characterized by a set of quantum numbers. For an electron in the highest-energy occupied atomic orbital of a ground-state silicon atom, calculate the magnitude of its orbital angular momentum. Express your final answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.", "solution": "A neutral silicon atom has atomic number 14, so it has 14 electrons. In its ground electronic state, the electrons fill orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, and the Pauli exclusion principle, yielding the configuration\n$$\n1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{2}.\n$$\nThe highest-energy occupied atomic orbital in the ground state is the $3p$ subshell.

In multi-electron atoms, these individual spins combine to produce a total spin angular momentum, $S$, which is critical for understanding atomic spectroscopy and magnetic properties. This practice will guide you through calculating the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$, for a manganese atom, a classic example that illustrates Hund's rule and the principle of spin addition [@problem_id:1389301].", "problem": "The magnetic properties of an atom are determined by its electronic structure, specifically the arrangement of electrons in its orbitals.

The $4s^{2}$ subshell is fully occupied with two electrons of opposite spin, contributing zero net spin. The $3d^{5}$ subshell in the ground state follows Hund's first rule: electrons occupy different $d$ orbitals with parallel spins to maximize the total spin. Thus, all five $3d$ electrons are unpaired and aligned.\n\nEach unpaired electron has spin quantum number $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. With $N=5$ unpaired electrons aligned, the total spin quantum number is\n$$\nS = N \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}.\n$$\nThe spin multiplicity is defined as $2S+1$, hence\n$$\n2S+1 = 2 \\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n$$\nTherefore, the spin multiplicity of ground-state Mn is $6$ (a sextet).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1389301"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the magnitude of the angular momentum vector, we now turn to its direction, which reveals one of quantum mechanics' most striking features: space quantization. Unlike a classical vector, the orbital angular momentum vector cannot point in any arbitrary direction; its orientation relative to an external axis is also quantized.
