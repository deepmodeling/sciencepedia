A key descriptor of a multi-electron atomic state is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, denoted by the symbol $L$. This quantum number arises from the vector coupling of the orbital angular momenta of the individual electrons. For any atom, the value of $L$ for a given electronic state is determined almost exclusively by the electrons in its outermost, partially-filled subshells, as completed subshells contribute nothing to the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nConsider a neutral Silicon (Si) atom in its ground electronic state. The electron configuration for Si is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2$. Based on the established principles for determining the ground state of multi-electron atoms, calculate the value of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$.", "solution": "The closed subshells $1s^{2}$, $2s^{2}$, $2p^{6}$, and $3s^{2}$ contribute no net orbital angular momentum, so only the two electrons in the partially filled $3p$ subshell determine $L$.

The Pauli principle for two equivalent $p$ electrons restricts the allowed term symbols to\n$$\n{}^{1}S\\ (L=0,\\ S=0),\\quad {}^{1}D\\ (L=2,\\ S=0),\\quad {}^{3}P\\ (L=1,\\ S=1).\n$$\nHundâ€™s first rule states that, among terms arising from a given electron configuration, the term with the maximum multiplicity (maximum $S$) lies lowest in energy. Therefore, the ground term is the triplet ${}^{3}P$, which has $S=1$ and hence $L=1$.\n\nThus, for the ground state of Si with configuration $3p^{2}$, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "1418652"}, {"introduction": "The different total angular momentum states, or 'terms,' arising from a configuration have different energies due to electron-electron interactions.
