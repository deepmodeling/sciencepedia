[@problem_id:1373298]", "problem": "The electronic configuration of an atom dictates its chemical properties and spectroscopic behavior. For a multi-electron atom like iron (Fe, atomic number Z = 26), the arrangement of electrons in orbitals is governed by a set of rules, including Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. This rule asserts that for a given electronic configuration, the state with the highest possible total spin multiplicity lies lowest in energy.\n\nThe valence electron configuration of a neutral iron atom in its ground state is [Ar] $4s^2 3d^6$. Consider the various possible arrangements of the six electrons within the $3d$ subshell, represented by the orbital diagrams below.

Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity states that the lowest energy arrangement of electrons in a subshell is the one with the greatest number of parallel spins. To achieve this for a $3d^6$ configuration:\n1.  Place one electron in each of the five $d$ orbitals with parallel spins (e.g., all spin-up). This accounts for five electrons.\n2.  Place the sixth electron in one of the orbitals, pairing it with the electron already present. The spin of this new electron must be opposite to the first, according to the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThis procedure results in one doubly-occupied orbital and four singly-occupied orbitals. The four unpaired electrons all have parallel spins. The orbital diagram is: [↑↓] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ].\n\nThe total spin angular momentum, $S$, is the sum of the spin quantum numbers ($m_s = +1/2$ for ↑, $m_s = -1/2$ for ↓).\nFor the ground state, the paired electrons have a total spin of $(+1/2) + (-1/2) = 0$. The four unpaired electrons have a total spin of $S = 4 \\times (+1/2) = 2$.\nThe spin multiplicity is given by the formula $2S+1$. For the ground state, the multiplicity is $2(2) + 1 = 5$. This is the maximum possible multiplicity for a $d^6$ configuration. Any valid configuration with a multiplicity less than 5 represents an excited state that violates Hund's rule.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A: $3d$: [↑↓] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ]**\n    This is the exact configuration we determined for the ground state. It has the maximum multiplicity of 5. Therefore, it is not an excited state and does not violate Hund's rule.\n\n*   **Option B: $3d$: [↑↓] [↑↓] [↑↓] [  ] [  ]**\n    This configuration has six electrons, so it is a valid $3d^6$ arrangement in terms of electron count. However, it pairs electrons into three orbitals while leaving two orbitals completely empty. This violates Hund's rule, which requires filling orbitals singly first. Let's calculate the multiplicity. All electrons are paired, so the total spin is $S = 0$. The multiplicity is $2(0) + 1 = 1$. Since $1  5$, this configuration violates Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity and represents a valid excited state.\n\n*   **Option C: $3d$: [↑↓] [↑↓] [↑ ] [↑ ] [  ]**\n    This is another valid $3d^6$ configuration. It has one empty orbital, which violates the \"fill singly first\" aspect of Hund's rule. There are two unpaired electrons with parallel spins. The total spin is $S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$. The multiplicity is $2(1) + 1 = 3$. Since $3  5$, this configuration violates Hund's rule and represents a valid excited state.\n\n*   **Option D: $3d$: [↑↓] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↓ ]**\n    This is a valid $3d^6$ configuration. Each orbital is occupied before complete pairing, but the spins of the electrons in the singly occupied orbitals are not all parallel. There are three spin-up electrons and one spin-down electron among the four singly-occupied orbitals. The total spin is $S = (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) + (-1/2) = 1$. The multiplicity is $2(1) + 1 = 3$. Since $3  5$, this configuration violates Hund's rule and represents a valid excited state.\n\n*   **Option E: $3d$: [↑↑] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ] [↑ ]**\n    This diagram shows two electrons with the same spin (spin-up) in the first orbital. This violates the Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids any two electrons in an atom from having the same four quantum numbers (in this case, $n, l, m_l, \\text{ and } m_s$). Therefore, this is not a physically possible or valid configuration for an atom.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\nOptions B, C, and D all represent physically valid electronic configurations for the $3d^6$ subshell of iron. Each of these configurations has a total spin multiplicity (1, 3, and 3, respectively) that is less than the maximum multiplicity of the ground state (5).

The determination of the ground-state term symbol, $^{2S+1}L_J$, follows Hund's rules.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the maximum total spin quantum number, S.**\nThe configuration is $f^2$. For an f-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=3$. The magnetic orbital quantum numbers $m_l$ can take values from $-l$ to $+l$, i.e., $m_l \\in \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3\\}$.\nHund's first rule states that the ground state will have the maximum possible total spin, which maximizes the spin multiplicity $2S+1$. To achieve this, the two electrons should be placed in different spatial orbitals with parallel spins.\nLet the spin quantum number for each electron be $m_{s,1} = +1/2$ and $m_{s,2} = +1/2$.\nThe total spin quantum number is $S = \\sum m_s = m_{s,1} + m_{s,2} = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.\nThe spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. This corresponds to a triplet state.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the maximum total orbital angular momentum quantum number, L.**\nHund's second rule states that for a given multiplicity, the state with the largest value of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ will have the lowest energy. To maximize $L = |\\sum m_l|$, we must place the two electrons (which already have parallel spins) into the available orbitals with the highest possible $m_l$ values.\nThe available $m_l$ values are $\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. To maximize the sum, we place the first electron in the $m_l = +3$ orbital and the second electron in the $m_l = +2$ orbital.\nThe total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L = |m_{l,1} + m_{l,2}| = |3 + 2| = 5$.\nThe spectroscopic letter corresponding to $L=5$ is H.\nCombining results from Step 1 and Step 2, the term is $^3H$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the total angular momentum quantum number, J.**\nHund's third rule determines the value of $J$ for the ground state. The possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series: $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\dots, L+S$.\nWith $L=5$ and $S=1$, the possible values of $J$ are:\n$J = |5-1|, \\dots, 5+1 \\implies J \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\}$.\nTo select the ground-state $J$ value, we must consider the filling of the subshell.\nAn f-subshell can accommodate a maximum of $2(2l+1) = 2(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) = 14$ electrons. The configuration is $f^2$, which is less than half-filled (a half-filled f-subshell would be $f^7$).\nFor subshells that are less than half-filled, the ground state is the one with the minimum possible $J$ value.\nTherefore, the ground state has $J=4$.\nThe ground-state term symbol for an $f^2$ configuration is $^{2S+1}L_J = {}^3H_4$. This eliminates options B, D, and E.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the validity of L-S coupling for $Pr^{3+}$ versus $U^{4+}$.**\nThe L-S (Russell-Saunders) coupling scheme assumes that the electrostatic repulsion between electrons is the dominant interaction, and spin-orbit coupling is a smaller perturbation. Spin-orbit coupling describes the interaction between an electron's spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field generated by its orbital motion around the nucleus. The strength of this interaction scales strongly with the nuclear charge, approximately as $Z^4$.\n\n$Pr^{3+}$ is a lanthanide ion with atomic number $Z=59$.\n$U^{4+}$ is an actinide ion with atomic number $Z=92$.\n\nSince Uranium ($Z=92$) has a significantly larger nuclear charge than Praseodymium ($Z=59$), the spin-orbit coupling interaction will be much stronger in the $U^{4+}$ ion. In actinides, the spin-orbit interaction becomes comparable in magnitude to the electrostatic repulsions. This causes the L-S coupling scheme to break down. For such heavy elements, the j-j coupling scheme (where individual electron total angular momenta $j_i$ are coupled) becomes a better approximation, although an intermediate coupling scheme is often the most accurate description.\nFor lanthanides like $Pr^{3+}$, while not perfect, the L-S coupling scheme remains a reasonably good approximation for describing the electronic ground state and lower excited states.\n\nTherefore, the ground-state term symbol $^3H_4$ is a much more accurate description for $Pr^{3+}$ than for $U^{4+}$. For $U^{4+}$, $^3H_4$ is best understood as a label for the state that arises from the $f^2$ configuration in the L-S coupling limit, even though the actual physical state is a complex mixture of different $L$ and $S$ terms due to strong spin-orbit mixing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe ground-state term symbol is $^3H_4$, and this L-S coupling description is more accurate for $Pr^{3+}$ than for the heavier $U^{4+}$ ion.
