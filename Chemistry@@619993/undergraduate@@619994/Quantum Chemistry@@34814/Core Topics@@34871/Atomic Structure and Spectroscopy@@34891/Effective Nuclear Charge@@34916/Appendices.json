Successfully reasoning through this problem demonstrates a deeper, more holistic understanding of the factors governing electronic structure and reactivity.", "problem": "The first ionization energy, the energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous atom, generally increases across a period in the periodic table. This trend is primarily attributed to the increase in effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\\text{eff}}$) experienced by the valence electrons. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend. Consider the third-period elements phosphorus (P, atomic number $Z=15$) and sulfur (S, atomic number $Z=16$). The first ionization energy of phosphorus is 1012 kJ/mol, while that of sulfur is 1000 kJ/mol, showing a slight decrease.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most complete and accurate explanation for this anomaly?\n\nA. The effective nuclear charge of sulfur is indeed higher than that of phosphorus, but the additional electron-electron repulsion in the first doubly-occupied 3p orbital in sulfur slightly outweighs the effect of the increased nuclear attraction, making the electron easier to remove.\nB. The effective nuclear charge of phosphorus is significantly higher than that of sulfur, which is why it costs more energy to remove an electron from phosphorus.\nC. Phosphorus has a half-filled 3p subshell, which confers an exceptionally high stability. This stability is the sole reason its ionization energy is greater than that of sulfur.\nD. The valence electrons in sulfur experience less shielding from core electrons compared to phosphorus, leading to a stronger attraction to the nucleus and thus a higher ionization energy.\nE. The atomic radius of sulfur is larger than that of phosphorus, meaning its valence electron is further from the nucleus and therefore easier to remove, resulting in a lower ionization energy.", "solution": "The first ionization energy $I_{1}$ is the energy required to remove the most weakly bound (valence) electron from a gaseous atom. Across a period, $I_{1}$ generally increases because the effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ experienced by valence electrons increases while the principal quantum number remains constant, strengthening the electron–nucleus attraction.\n\nPhosphorus and sulfur have electron configurations:\n- Phosphorus: $[\\text{Ne}]\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{3}$.\n- Sulfur: $[\\text{Ne}]\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{4}$.\n\nBy Hund’s rule, phosphorus has a half-filled $3p$ subshell with three electrons occupying three different $p$ orbitals with parallel spins, which maximizes exchange stabilization and avoids any electron pairing. In sulfur, the $3p^{4}$ configuration introduces the first doubly occupied $3p$ orbital, which adds an intra-orbital electron–electron repulsion term (pairing energy). Symbolically, one can decompose the binding energy of a valence $p$ electron as a sum of a one-electron term that increases with $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and two-electron interaction terms:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\approx E_{1}(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}) + E_{\\mathrm{Coul}} - E_{\\mathrm{exch}} - E_{\\mathrm{pair}}\n$$\nGoing from phosphorus to sulfur:\n- $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ increases, which raises $E_{1}(Z_{\\text{eff}})$ and would increase $I_{1}$.\n- The first pairing in sulfur increases $E_{\\mathrm{pair}}$ (an energy penalty in the neutral atom), which is relieved upon removing the paired electron, effectively lowering $I_{1}$ relative to the trend.\n- Exchange stabilization is maximal for the half-filled $3p^{3}$ and is partially reduced for $3p^{4}$, also making the sulfur electron slightly easier to remove.\n\nThus the net change in ionization energy from P to S can be expressed qualitatively as\n$$\n\\Delta I_{1}(\\text{S-P}) \\approx \\Delta E_{1}(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}) - \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{pair}} - \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{exch}}\n$$,\nand the observed slight decrease implies that the increase in $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is slightly outweighed by the additional electron–electron repulsion associated with pairing (and reduced exchange stabilization) in sulfur. Therefore:\n- Statement A correctly acknowledges that $Z_{\\text{eff}}(\\text{S})>Z_{\\text{eff}}(\\text{P})$ but explains that the additional intra-orbital repulsion in sulfur slightly lowers $I_{1}$.\n- Statement B is incorrect because $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ is not higher for phosphorus.\n- Statement C is incomplete and overstated: while half-filled subshell stability contributes via exchange energy, it is not the sole reason; the explanation must weigh both $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and electron–electron repulsion.\n- Statement D contradicts the observed lower $I_{1}$ for sulfur.\n- Statement E is factually incorrect because atomic radius decreases from phosphorus to sulfur.\n\nHence the most complete and accurate explanation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2248608"}]}
