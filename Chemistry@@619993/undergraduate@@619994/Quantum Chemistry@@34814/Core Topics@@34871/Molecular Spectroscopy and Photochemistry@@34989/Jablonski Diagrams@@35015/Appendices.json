The quantum yield of a particular photophysical process is the ratio of the rate of that process to the sum of the rates of all deactivation processes from the excited state.\n\nFirst, we must identify all possible deactivation pathways for the $S_1$ state and their corresponding rate constants. The problem states three pathways:\n1.  Fluorescence: $S_1 \\to S_0 + h\\nu$, with rate constant $k_F = 1.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n2.

Intersystem Crossing (ISC): $S_1 \\to T_k$, with rate constant $k_{ISC}$.\n\nThe total rate of deactivation of the $S_1$ state, $k_{total}$, is the sum of the rates of all these processes:\n$$k_{total} = k_F + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}$$\n\nThe quantum yield of intersystem crossing is then given by:\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{k_{ISC}}{k_{total}} = \\frac{k_{ISC}}{k_F + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}}$$\n\nTo calculate $\\Phi_{ISC}$, we must first determine the value of $k_{ISC}$. There are two possible triplet states, $T_1$ and $T_2$, to which the molecule can cross from $S_1$. We need to determine which pathway is dominant.\n\nThe rate of ISC is proportional to the square of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) matrix element, $|\\langle S_1 | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_k \\rangle|^2$. Let's examine the two possibilities:\n-   **Path 1: $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\to T_1(\\pi, \\pi^*)$**\n    The SOC matrix element is given as $|\\langle S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\rangle| = 0.05 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n-   **Path 2: $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\to T_2(n, \\pi^*)$**\n    The SOC matrix element is given as $|\\langle S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_2(n, \\pi^*) \\rangle| = 0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\nAccording to El-Sayed's rule, spin-orbit coupling, and thus intersystem crossing, is significantly more efficient between states of different electronic orbital character (e.g., $(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\leftrightarrow (n, \\pi^*)$) than between states of the same character (e.g., $(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\leftrightarrow (\\pi, \\pi^*)$). The provided matrix elements reflect this rule, as the value for the $S_1 \\to T_2$ transition ($0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$) is much larger than for the $S_1 \\to T_1$ transition ($0.05 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\nSince the rate constant $k_{ISC}$ is proportional to the square of this matrix element, the rate of crossing to $T_2$ will be $(0.80/0.05)^2 = 16^2 = 256$ times faster than the rate of crossing to $T_1$. Therefore, the ISC process is overwhelmingly dominated by the $S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) \\to T_2(n, \\pi^*)$ pathway. We can neglect the contribution from the $S_1 \\to T_1$ pathway and use the matrix element for the $S_1 \\to T_2$ transition to calculate the overall $k_{ISC}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $k_{ISC}$ using the provided formula and the dominant matrix element:\n$$k_{ISC} = C \\times |\\langle S_1(\\pi, \\pi^*) | \\hat{H}_{SO} | T_2(n, \\pi^*) \\rangle|^2$$\nGiven values are $C = 4.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the matrix element is $0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n$$k_{ISC} = (4.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.80 \\text{ cm}^{-1})^2$$\n$$k_{ISC} = (4.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\times (0.64) \\text{ s}^{-1} = 2.56 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n\nNow we have all the rate constants needed to calculate the quantum yield:\n-   $k_F = 1.2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{IC} = 5.0 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 0.5 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n-   $k_{ISC} = 2.56 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n\nLet's substitute these into the quantum yield formula:\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{k_{ISC}}{k_F + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{1.2 \\times 10^8 + 5.0 \\times 10^7 + 2.56 \\times 10^{10}}$$\nTo simplify the sum in the denominator, let's express all terms with a common power of 10.\n$$k_F + k_{IC} = 1.2 \\times 10^8 + 0.5 \\times 10^8 = 1.7 \\times 10^8 \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{1.7 \\times 10^8 + 2.56 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{0.017 \\times 10^{10} + 2.56 \\times 10^{10}}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{10}}{(0.017 + 2.56) \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2.56}{2.577}$$\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} \\approx 0.993399...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Phi_{ISC} = 0.993$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.993}$$", "id": "1376725"}, {"introduction": "Beyond tracking the fate of excited state populations, it is crucial to account for the flow of energy in a photophysical system.
