This first practice explores the fundamental \"gross selection rule\" for pure rotational Raman scattering.

The goal is to study the rotational energy levels of the molecule. To the researcher's surprise, after careful data acquisition and background subtraction, the resulting spectrum shows a very strong central line corresponding to Rayleigh scattering, but there are no distinct, equally spaced lines on either side of the Rayleigh line that would indicate a pure rotational Raman spectrum. The researcher confirms the instrument is functioning correctly by observing a clear pure rotational Raman spectrum for nitrogen ($N_2$) gas under the same conditions. Methane is known as a \"spherical top\" molecule due to its tetrahedral geometry.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical explanation for the absence of a pure rotational Raman spectrum for methane?\n\nA. Methane lacks a permanent electric dipole moment, and this selection rule forbids any interaction with the incident electromagnetic radiation that could lead to a rotational transition.\n\nB. The polarizability of a spherical top molecule is isotropic, meaning it does not change as the molecule rotates, thus failing to meet the gross selection rule for rotational Raman activity.\n\nC. The C-H chemical bonds in methane are non-polarizable, preventing any form of Raman scattering, both rotational and vibrational.\n\nD. Due to methane's high symmetry, the rotational energy levels are degenerate, and quantum mechanics forbids transitions between states with the same energy.\n\nE. The specific rotational selection rule for spherical top molecules is $\\Delta J = 0$ only, which corresponds to Rayleigh scattering, while transitions with $\\Delta J \\neq 0$ are strictly forbidden.", "solution": "Raman scattering arises from the interaction of the incident field with the molecule’s induced dipole moment. The induced dipole is given by\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{ind}}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\cdot \\mathbf{E},\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the molecular polarizability tensor and $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field of the light. The gross selection rule for Raman activity is that the molecular motion must change the polarizability tensor; in particular, for pure rotational Raman scattering, the rotation must modulate the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ in the laboratory frame.\n\nDecompose the polarizability tensor into its isotropic and anisotropic parts. Define the mean (isotropic) polarizability\n$$\n\\bar{\\alpha}=\\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\n$$\nand the anisotropy measure\n$$\n\\gamma^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\alpha_{xx}-\\alpha_{yy})^{2}+(\\alpha_{yy}-\\alpha_{zz})^{2}+(\\alpha_{zz}-\\alpha_{xx})^{2}\\right],\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{ii}$ are principal components in the molecular frame. The intensity of pure rotational Raman lines is proportional to $\\gamma^{2}$; specifically, the inelastic rotational sidebands (with $\\Delta J=\\pm 2$) vanish if $\\gamma^{2}=0$, while the elastic Rayleigh line (with $\\Delta J=0$) depends on $\\bar{\\alpha}$.\n\nFor a spherical top molecule such as methane, symmetry imposes\n$$\n\\alpha_{xx}=\\alpha_{yy}=\\alpha_{zz}\\equiv \\alpha_{0},\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\alpha_{0}\\mathbf{I},\\quad \\bar{\\alpha}=\\alpha_{0},\\quad \\gamma^{2}=0.\n$$\nBecause $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is proportional to the identity, it is invariant under rotation, and rotational motion does not modulate the tensor in the laboratory frame. Consequently, the induced dipole\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{ind}}=\\alpha_{0}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nis always colinear with $\\mathbf{E}$ and does not acquire time-dependent components associated with rotational motion. Therefore, only elastic (Rayleigh) scattering is observed, and there are no pure rotational Raman sidebands.\n\nThis explains why methane shows a strong Rayleigh line but no pure rotational Raman lines, whereas nitrogen, a linear molecule with anisotropic polarizability ($\\alpha_{\\parallel}\\neq \\alpha_{\\perp}$, hence $\\gamma^{2}\\neq 0$), exhibits a clear pure rotational Raman spectrum.\n\nEvaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect because the absence of a permanent dipole moment suppresses pure rotational microwave absorption, not Raman scattering; homonuclear diatomics like $N_{2}$ have no dipole yet are rotationally Raman active.\n- B is correct: for a spherical top, the polarizability is isotropic and does not change with molecular rotation, violating the gross Raman requirement for pure rotational activity.\n- C is incorrect: C–H bonds are polarizable; methane has strong vibrational Raman lines and exhibits Rayleigh scattering.\n- D is incorrect: although spherical tops have degeneracies, rotational energy levels labeled by $J$ are separated; the absence of lines is due to vanishing matrix elements from isotropy, not forbidden same-energy transitions.\n- E is incorrect: the rotational Raman selection rule in general is $\\Delta J=0,\\pm 2$, but for spherical tops the $\\Delta J=\\pm 2$ intensities vanish because $\\gamma^{2}=0$; it is not that the selection rule is $\\Delta J=0$ only.\n\nTherefore, the correct physical explanation is that the polarizability of a spherical top is isotropic, so rotation does not modulate it, and pure rotational Raman lines are absent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1390287"}, {"introduction": "After establishing that a molecule can exhibit a rotational Raman spectrum, the next step is to predict the positions of the spectral lines.
