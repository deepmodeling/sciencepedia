This practice [@problem_id:2031438] challenges you to connect this structural change to the features of a realistic absorption spectrum, where transitions to excited vibrational levels ($v'>0$) can be much stronger than the $0 \\to 0$ transition. Mastering this connection is key to deciphering the rich information about molecular structure encoded in vibronic spectra.", "problem": "In the absorption spectroscopy of a certain diatomic molecule, an electronic transition is observed. It is found that the vast majority of the molecules are initially in the ground vibrational state ($v''=0$) of the ground electronic state. The observed spectrum shows that the transition from this initial state to the ground vibrational state of the excited electronic state ($v'=0$) is extremely weak. However, the transitions to the first and second excited vibrational states of the excited electronic state ($v'=1$ and $v'=2$) are observed to be very strong. Let $R_e''$ be the equilibrium internuclear distance of the ground electronic state and $R_e'$ be the equilibrium internuclear distance of the excited electronic state.\n\nBased on the Franck-Condon principle, which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The equilibrium internuclear distance of the excited state, $R_e'$, is significantly different from that of the ground state, $R_e''$.\n\nB.

The selection rules for vibronic transitions forbid the $v''=0 \\to v'=0$ transition.", "solution": "We apply the Franck-Condon principle and the Condon approximation. The absorption intensity for a vibronic transition from an initial vibrational level $v''$ in the lower electronic potential to a final vibrational level $v'$ in the upper electronic potential is proportional to $I_{v'v''} \\propto |\\langle \\chi_{v'}'(R) \\mid \\chi_{v''}''(R) \\rangle|^2 |\\mu_{el}|^2$, where $\\chi_{v''}''(R)$ and $\\chi_{v'}'(R)$ are the vibrational wavefunctions on the lower and upper electronic potentials, and $\\mu_{el}$ is the (approximately $R$-independent) electronic transition dipole moment. Thus, the relative intensities are governed by Franck-Condon (FC) factors, $q_{v'v''} = |\\langle \\chi_{v'}'(R) \\mid \\chi_{v''}''(R) \\rangle|^2$.\n\nBy the Franck-Condon principle, electronic transitions are vertical in $R$ (nuclei are effectively stationary during the fast electronic transition), so the observed $v'$ distribution reflects the overlap between the initial vibrational wavefunction, localized near the ground-state equilibrium distance $R_{e}''$, and the vibrational eigenfunctions of the excited electronic state, centered near its equilibrium distance $R_{e}'$.\n\nAssume the harmonic approximation for both electronic states and model the two potentials as displaced harmonic oscillators with the same normal coordinate mass and curvature parameters for simplicity. Define the displacement $\\Delta R = R_{e}' - R_{e}''$ and the Huang-Rhys factor\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\mu \\omega'}{2\\hbar}\\,(\\Delta R)^{2},\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass and $\\omega'$ is the harmonic frequency of the excited state (an analogous expression holds if one uses the normal coordinate with identical curvatures; the key point is $S \\propto (\\Delta R)^{2}$). In this displaced harmonic-oscillator model, for initial $v''=0$, the FC factors follow a Poisson-like distribution:\n$\nq_{v'0} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,\\frac{S^{v'}}{v'!}.\n$\nHence,\n$$\nq_{00} \\propto \\exp(-S),\\quad q_{10} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,S,\\quad q_{20} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,\\frac{S^{2}}{2}.\n$$\nThe distribution peaks near $v' \\approx S$. Therefore:\n- If $R_{e}' \\approx R_{e}''$ so that $\\Delta R \\approx 0$, then $S \\approx 0$ and $q_{00}$ dominates, yielding a strong $v''=0 \\to v'=0$ transition.\n- If $R_{e}'$ is significantly displaced from $R_{e}''$, then $S$ is of order unity or larger, suppressing $q_{00}$ and enhancing $q_{10}$ and $q_{20}$, with the strongest transitions around $v' \\approx S$.\n\nThe observation reports an extremely weak $v''=0 \\to v'=0$ line, with very strong $v''=0 \\to v'=1$ and $v''=0 \\to v'=2$ lines. This is consistent with $S \\approx 1$ to $2$, which in turn requires a significant displacement $\\Delta R \\neq 0$, i.e., $R_{e}'$ significantly different from $R_{e}''$.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- A. $R_{e}'$ significantly different from $R_{e}''$: This directly accounts for a nonzero $S$ that shifts intensity from $v'=0$ to $v'=1,2$, matching the observation.\n- B. $R_{e}' \\approx R_{e}''$: This would give $S \\approx 0$ and a strong $0$-$0$ band, contrary to the observation.\n- C. Unbound excited state: This would yield a continuum rather than intense discrete $v'$ lines; it does not match the observed strong $v'=1,2$ lines.\n- D. Much smaller $\\omega'$ but identical $R_{e}$: With no displacement, the $0$-$0$ overlap remains large; frequency differences alone do not suppress $q_{00}$ to be extremely weak.\n- E. Selection rules forbid $v''=0 \\to v'=0$: There is no general vibronic selection rule forbidding $0$-$0$; suppression arises from FC overlap, not selection-rule prohibition.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the equilibrium internuclear distances are significantly different, consistent with option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2031438"}, {"introduction": "The consequences of a geometry change upon excitation extend beyond the absorption spectrum, creating a distinct signature when we compare absorption to fluorescence.
