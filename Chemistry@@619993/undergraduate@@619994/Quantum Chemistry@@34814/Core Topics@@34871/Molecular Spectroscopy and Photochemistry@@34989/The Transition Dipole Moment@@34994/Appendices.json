The primary goal is to predict its color. Using quantum chemical software, the chemist first calculates the energy difference between the ground electronic state, $\\psi_0$, and the first singlet excited state, $\\psi_1$. The result shows that this energy gap corresponds precisely to the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 580 nm (yellow light). It is also determined that this is the only electronic transition for the molecule that falls within the visible spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm).\n\nIn the second step of the analysis, the chemist computes the Transition Dipole Moment (TDM), defined as $\\vec{\\mu}_{10} = \\int \\psi_1^* \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} \\psi_0 d\\tau$, where $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is the electric dipole moment operator.
