The conservation of total angular momentum cannot be satisfied for a system comprising the atom and a single emitted photon.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental reason why a single-photon transition between two atomic states, both having a total angular momentum quantum number $J=0$, is forbidden. We need to analyze the options based on the principles of quantum mechanics and atomic physics.\n\nThe rate of spontaneous emission, governed by the Einstein A coefficient $A_{21}$, is primarily determined by the electric dipole interaction between the atom and the electromagnetic field. The transition is \"allowed\" if the electric dipole transition moment $\\vec{d}_{21} = \\langle 2 | e\\vec{r} | 1 \\rangle$ is non-zero, where $e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator. If this matrix element is zero, the transition is \"forbidden\" in the electric dipole approximation.\n\nWhether this matrix element is zero or non-zero is determined by selection rules, which are derived from fundamental conservation laws. Let's analyze the role of angular momentum conservation.\n\nA photon is a quantum particle with an intrinsic spin angular momentum of $s=1$. When an atom emits a single photon, the total angular momentum of the isolated system (atom + photon) must be conserved. Let $\\vec{J}_{atom, initial}$ be the initial angular momentum of the atom, and $\\vec{J}_{atom, final}$ be the final angular momentum of the atom. Let $\\vec{L}_{photon}$ be the orbital angular momentum of the emitted photon relative to the atom, and $\\vec{S}_{photon}$ be its spin angular momentum.\n\nThe conservation of total angular momentum requires:\n$$ \\vec{J}_{atom, initial} = \\vec{J}_{atom, final} + \\vec{L}_{photon} + \\vec{S}_{photon} $$\nLet $\\vec{j}_{photon} = \\vec{L}_{photon} + \\vec{S}_{photon}$ be the total angular momentum carried away by the photon. The quantum number $j$ associated with this total angular momentum must be a positive integer, $j \\ge 1$, because the photon spin is $s=1$. The simplest case (a dipole transition) corresponds to $j=1$.\n\nIn our specific problem, the initial state of the atom has $J_{initial} = 0$, and the final state has $J_{final} = 0$.\nThe conservation of angular momentum becomes a vector addition problem. The initial total angular momentum of the system is just that of the atom, which is 0. The final total angular momentum of the system is the sum of the atom's final angular momentum and the photon's angular momentum, which must also be 0.\n$$ \\vec{J}_{final, system} = \\vec{J}_{atom, final} + \\vec{j}_{photon} = \\vec{0} $$\nSince the atom's final state has $J_{final}=0$, its angular momentum vector is $\\vec{J}_{atom, final} = \\vec{0}$. This implies:\n$$ \\vec{j}_{photon} = \\vec{0} $$\nThis is a contradiction. A single photon, being a spin-1 particle, cannot have a total angular momentum of zero. It must carry away at least one unit of angular momentum ($j \\ge 1$). Therefore, it is impossible to conserve total angular momentum in a single-photon emission process that connects two $J=0$ states. This leads to the well-known selection rule for electric dipole transitions that a $J=0 \\to J=0$ transition is forbidden.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. The Pauli exclusion principle forbids the transition.\nThis is incorrect. The Pauli exclusion principle applies to identical fermions (like electrons) and states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. While it is fundamental to atomic structure, it is not the direct principle that forbids this radiative transition between two distinct energy levels of the atom as a whole.\n\nB. A transition between any two states of identical total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is always forbidden.\nThis is incorrect. Transitions where $\\Delta J = J_{final} - J_{initial} = 0$ are generally allowed. For example, a transition from a $J=2$ state to another $J=2$ state is possible, provided other selection rules (like parity change) are met. The special case that is forbidden is $J=0 \\to J=0$.\n\nC. For an allowed transition to occur, the initial and final states must have the same parity.\nThis is incorrect. For an electric dipole (E1) transition, which is the most common type, the selection rule for parity is that it must *change*. That is, $\\Delta \\Pi = \\pm 1$. If the initial and final states have the same parity, the E1 transition is forbidden.\n\nD. The conservation of total angular momentum cannot be satisfied for a system comprising the atom and a single emitted photon.\nThis is correct. As explained above, an initial state with $J=0$ has zero angular momentum. The final state consists of an atom with $J=0$ (zero angular momentum) and an emitted photon, which must carry at least one unit of angular momentum ($j \\ge 1$). The final total angular momentum is therefore non-zero, while the initial was zero. This violates the conservation of total angular momentum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1989119"}]}
