The vibrational state of the molecule is described by a quantum number $v$ (where $v = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$) and a corresponding real-valued wavefunction $\\psi_v(x)$, where $x$ represents the displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium separation.\n\nAn electromagnetic wave can induce a transition between an initial vibrational state $\\psi_i$ and a final vibrational state $\\psi_f$. In the electric dipole approximation, such a transition is considered \"allowed\" only if the transition dipole moment integral, given by $\\mu_{fi} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_f(x) \\hat{\\mu}_x \\psi_i(x) dx$, is non-zero. If the integral is exactly zero, the transition is \"forbidden\".\n\nFor a molecule to show a vibrational spectrum, its electric dipole moment must change during the vibration. We can model the electric dipole moment operator along the vibrational axis, $\\hat{\\mu}_x$, as being directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium, i.e., $\\hat{\\mu}_x = c \\cdot x$, where $c$ is a non-zero constant.\n\nA key property of the QHO wavefunctions is their parity: $\\psi_v(x)$ is an even function (symmetric, i.e., $\\psi_v(-x) = \\psi_v(x)$) if the quantum number $v$ is even, and it is an odd function (antisymmetric, i.e., $\\psi_v(-x) = -\\psi_v(x)$) if $v$ is odd.\n\nUsing only this information about the parity of the functions involved, determine the nature of the first overtone transition, which corresponds to the excitation from the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) to the second excited vibrational state ($v=2$).

The transition is allowed because both the initial ($v=0$) and final ($v=2$) states are described by even functions.\n\nC.
