This exercise explores a hypothetical molecule belonging to the $C_1$ point group, which has no symmetry elements besides the identity operation.

The molecule has a total of 10 fundamental vibrational modes.\n\nB. All vibrational modes of the molecule are active in either Infrared (IR) spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy, but no single mode can be active in both.\n\nC.

For a non-linear molecule with $N$ atoms, the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom is given by\n$$\n3N-6.\n$$\nHere $N=5$, so the number of fundamental vibrational modes is\n$$\n3 \\times 5 - 6 = 9,\n$$\nwhich shows that option A (10 modes) is incorrect.\n\nIn $C_1$ there is only one irreducible representation, which is one-dimensional (totally symmetric). Therefore all normal modes are non-degenerate; this contradicts option C, which incorrectly attributes a high degree of symmetry and degeneracy.\n\nIR activity requires that the irreducible representation of a vibrational mode transform like one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. In $C_1$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ all transform as the totally symmetric irreducible representation, and so does every vibrational mode. Hence all vibrational modes are IR active.\n\nRaman activity requires that the mode transform like one of the quadratic functions ($x^{2}$, $y^{2}$, $z^{2}$, $xy$, $xz$, $yz$). In $C_1$, all quadratic functions also transform as the totally symmetric irreducible representation, so all vibrational modes are Raman active. Therefore, all fundamental vibrations are simultaneously IR and Raman active, which rules out the mutual exclusion implied by option B and supports option D. The mutual exclusion rule applies to centrosymmetric point groups, which $C_1$ is not.\n\nFinally, planarity is not required for $C_1$ symmetry; $C_1$ simply means the absence of any symmetry beyond the identity, which may occur in nonplanar geometries.

For $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, the molecule is bent and planar with two identical $\\mathrm{H}$ atoms. The symmetry operations are the identity $E$, a twofold rotation $C_{2}$ about an axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and passing through O, and two mirror planes $\\sigma_{v}$: one is the molecular plane itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane and bisects the $\\angle\\mathrm{HOH}$. These operations define the point group $C_{2v}$.\n\nUpon isotopic substitution to form $\\mathrm{HDO}$, the $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ atoms are no longer equivalent. Any symmetry operation that exchanges the two hydrogens in $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ is no longer valid for $\\mathrm{HDO}$. Specifically, the $C_{2}$ rotation and the perpendicular mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}$ that would swap $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{D}$ cease to be symmetries. However, the molecular plane remains a mirror plane because all atoms lie in that plane and are not exchanged under reflection in it. Therefore, the remaining symmetry operations are $E$ and the molecular plane $\\sigma$, which corresponds to the point group $C_{s}$. Thus, the point group is lowered from $C_{2v}$ to $C_{s}$.\n\nNext, we determine the number of fundamental vibrational modes.

The IR selection rule is that a vibrational mode is IR-active if its normal coordinate transforms as one of the Cartesian components of the dipole moment vector $(\\mu_{x},\\mu_{y},\\mu_{z})$, equivalently as $(x,y,z)$ under the point group.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ in $C_{2v}$, the Cartesian components transform as $A_{1}$ for $z$, $B_{1}$ for $x$, and $B_{2}$ for $y$. The three normal modes of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ have symmetries $A_{1}$ (symmetric stretch), $A_{1}$ (bend), and $B_{2}$ (asymmetric stretch), all of which correspond to $x$, $y$, or $z$ and are therefore IR-active. Hence $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ has $3$ IR-active fundamentals.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{HDO}$ in $C_{s}$, the irreducible representations are $A'$ (in-plane) and $A''$ (out-of-plane). The dipole components transform as $x,y\\to A'$ and $z\\to A''$, so both $A'$ and $A''$ are IR-active.
