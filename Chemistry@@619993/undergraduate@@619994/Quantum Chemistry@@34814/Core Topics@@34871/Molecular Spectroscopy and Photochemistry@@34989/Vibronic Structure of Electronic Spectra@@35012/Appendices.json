The molecule is first exposed to light, which excites it from the ground vibrational level ($v''=0$) of $S_0$ to various vibrational levels of $S_1$.

The fluorescence spectrum will exhibit a long progression of vibronic peaks, with the maximum intensity corresponding to a transition to a high vibrational level ($v'' \\gg 0$) of the ground state.\n\nE. Both absorption and fluorescence spectra will be weak and extremely broad, almost featureless, because the identical geometries of the states prevent strong coupling to any specific vibrational mode.", "solution": "By the Franck-Condon principle under the Condon approximation, the intensity for a vibronic transition is proportional to the squared overlap of vibrational wavefunctions (the Franck-Condon factor) times the square of the electronic transition dipole moment, treated as approximately coordinate-independent:\n$$\nI_{v''\\to v'} \\propto |\\mu_{eg}|^{2}\\,|\\langle v'|v''\\rangle|^{2}.\n$$\nFor harmonic potentials with the same frequency in the ground and excited states and a displacement \\Delta Q between their equilibrium geometries, the Franck-Condon factors for transitions originating from $v''=0$ form a Poisson distribution in terms of the Huang-Rhys factor $S$, which measures the dimensionless reorganization energy and scales with the square of the displacement:\n$$\nS \\propto \\Delta Q^{2}, \\quad FC_{0\\to n} \\equiv |\\langle n|0\\rangle|^{2} = \\exp(-S)\\frac{S^{n}}{n!}.\n$$\nThe problem states that the $S_{0}$ and $S_{1}$ potential energy surfaces have nearly identical equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies for the dominant modes. This implies $\\Delta Q \\approx 0$ and thus $S \\approx 0$. Therefore:\n- For absorption from $v''=0$ to $v'=n$, the Franck-Condon factors satisfy $FC_{0\\to 0}\\approx 1$ and $FC_{0\\to n\\ge 1}\\approx 0$, so the absorption spectrum is strongly dominated by the 0-0 transition.\n- After rapid intrastate vibrational relaxation to $v'=0$ in $S_{1}$, fluorescence occurs from $v'=0$ to $v''=n$ with intensities proportional to $FC_{n\\to 0}=|\\langle n|0\\rangle|^{2}=FC_{0\\to n}$ by symmetry of the overlap. Hence, the fluorescence spectrum is also strongly dominated by the 0-0 transition.\n\nThe transition energies for harmonic potentials with equal frequencies $\\omega$ are\n$$\nE_{0\\to n}^{\\text{abs}}=E_{00}+n\\hbar\\omega,\\qquad E_{0\\to n}^{\\text{fl}}=E_{00}-n\\hbar\\omega,\n$$\nand the corresponding intensities for absorption and emission share the same Franck-Condon factors $FC_{0\\to n}$. Therefore, the absorption and fluorescence spectra are mirror images about the 0-0 energy $E_{00}$. The Stokes shift (difference between the absorption and emission maxima) scales as the reorganization energy, which is $2S\\hbar\\omega$ in this model, and thus is negligible when $S\\approx 0$.\n\nAt low temperature, only $v''=0$ in $S_{0}$ is initially populated, so these conclusions hold without thermal broadening or hot bands. Consequently, both spectra are strongly dominated by the 0-0 line and exhibit near-perfect mirror symmetry about the 0-0 frequency, with minimal Stokes shift.\n\nThis corresponds to option C. The other options are inconsistent with $S\\approx 0$: options B and D require a large displacement ($S\\gg 1$) to produce long vibronic progressions with maxima at high $v$, option A requires a large Stokes shift (large $S$), and option E contradicts the expectation of sharp, intense 0-0 transitions when $S$ is small.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1422115"}]}
