Understanding this difference provides deep insight into physical phenomena like the thermal expansion of materials, as the average bond length changes with vibrational energy.", "problem": "The vibration of a diatomic molecule can be modeled in a simplified way using the quantum harmonic oscillator. In this model, the potential energy $V$ is a quadratic function of the displacement $x$ from the equilibrium internuclear separation $r_e$, i.e., $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x = r - r_e$. A more realistic description is provided by an anharmonic oscillator model, where the potential energy is not symmetric about the equilibrium position. For real molecules, the potential rises more steeply for bond compression ($x0$) than for bond stretching ($x0$), reflecting the fact that it is much harder to push two atoms together than to pull them slightly apart.\n\nConsider a diatomic molecule in a highly excited vibrational state, specifically the state with vibrational quantum number $v=10$.

The harmonic oscillator's probability density has its maximum at the equilibrium position ($x=0$), while the anharmonic oscillator's maximum is shifted to a positive displacement ($x0$).\nB. Both probability densities are symmetric about the equilibrium position ($x=0$), but the distribution for the anharmonic oscillator is significantly broader than for the harmonic oscillator.\nC. The harmonic oscillator's probability density is symmetric about the equilibrium position ($x=0$) with two main peaks of equal height near the classical turning points. In contrast, the anharmonic oscillator's probability density is asymmetric, with the peak corresponding to a larger internuclear separation ($x0$) being more pronounced than the peak at a smaller separation ($x0$).\nD. The number of nodes in the wavefunction $\\psi_{v=10}(x)$, and consequently the number of points where the probability density is zero, is different for the two models because of the different potential shapes.\nE. For the harmonic oscillator, the average internuclear separation $\\langle r \\rangle$ is equal to $r_e$. For the anharmonic oscillator, the average internuclear separation is less than $r_e$ because the strong repulsion during compression dominates the particle's position.", "solution": "We compare the harmonic oscillator model with a more realistic anharmonic model for a diatomic molecule at a high vibrational quantum number, here $v=10$.\n\nFor the harmonic oscillator, the potential is $V_{h}(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$, which is an even function, $V_{h}(x)=V_{h}(-x)$. In one dimension, for an even potential, the Hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator, so the eigenfunctions have definite parity.

Also, by symmetry, $\\langle x\\rangle=0$, so $\\langle r\\rangle=r_{e}$.\n\nFor a more realistic anharmonic potential, such as the Morse potential $V_{M}(x)=D_{e}\\left(1-\\exp(-ax)\\right)^{2}$, the potential is asymmetric: it is much steeper for $x0$ (compression) and shallower for $x0$ (stretching). In this case, the two classical turning points $x_{-}0$ and $x_{+}0$ are not symmetrically placed, and the local slope near $x_{-}$ is larger. The WKB argument above implies the probability density is enhanced where the classical speed $v_{\\text{cl}}(x)=p(x)/\\mu$ is smaller, i.e., where the particle spends more time. Because the potential rises more gently for $x0$, the particle lingers longer near the outer turning point, producing a more pronounced peak in $|\\psi(x)|^{2}$ on the $x0$ side.
