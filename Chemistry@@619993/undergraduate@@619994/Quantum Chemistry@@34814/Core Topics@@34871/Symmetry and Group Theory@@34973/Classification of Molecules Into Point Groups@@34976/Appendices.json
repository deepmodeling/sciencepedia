A fundamental method for classifying molecular geometry is to determine its symmetry point group.\n\nConsider the octahedral complex triamminetrichlorocobalt(III), which has the chemical formula $[\\text{Co(NH}_3)_3\\text{Cl}_3]$. This complex can exist as two different geometric isomers: facial (fac) and meridional (mer). In the facial (fac) isomer, the three ammine ligands ($\\text{NH}_3$) are positioned on the vertices of one triangular face of the octahedron, and the three chloride ligands (Cl) are on the opposite triangular face.\n\nBased on this geometric description, identify the correct point group for the facial isomer of triamminetrichlorocobalt(III) from the options below.\n\nA) $C_{2v}$\n\nB) $C_{3v}$\n\nC) $D_{3d}$\n\nD) $T_d$\n\nE) $C_s$", "solution": "We analyze the facial isomer of $[\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{3}\\text{Cl}_{3}]$, where the three $\\text{NH}_{3}$ ligands occupy one triangular face of the octahedron and the three $\\text{Cl}$ ligands occupy the opposite triangular face.\n\nFirst, identify the principal rotation axis. The line passing through the cobalt center and the centers of the two opposite triangular faces (one of $\\text{NH}_{3}$ and the other of $\\text{Cl}$) is a $C_{3}$ axis: a rotation by $2\\pi/3$ permutes the three $\\text{NH}_{3}$ among themselves and the three $\\text{Cl}$ among themselves, leaving the molecule indistinguishable. Thus, the principal axis is $C_{3}$.\n\nSecond, check for vertical mirror planes. There are three planes that contain the $C_{3}$ axis and pass through one $\\text{NH}_{3}$ ligand, the metal, and the opposite $\\text{Cl}$ ligand. Reflection in any such plane exchanges the other two $\\text{NH}_{3}$ and the other two $\\text{Cl}$, leaving the structure unchanged. Hence, there are three $\\sigma_{v}$ planes.\n\nThird, test for a horizontal mirror plane. A $\\sigma_{h}$ plane perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis would interchange the $\\text{NH}_{3}$ face with the $\\text{Cl}$ face. Since the ligand types differ, this is not a symmetry; therefore, no $\\sigma_{h}$ is present.\n\nFourth, test for $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis. Any putative $C_{2}$ axis perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis would interchange at least one $\\text{NH}_{3}$ with a $\\text{Cl}$, which is not allowed. Thus, there are no such $C_{2}$ axes.\n\nFifth, test for inversion and improper rotations. An inversion center would map the $\\text{NH}_{3}$ face to the $\\text{Cl}$ face, which is not allowed, so there is no inversion center. Without a $\\sigma_{h}$ plane, improper rotations such as $S_{3}$ are also absent.\n\nCollecting these elements, the molecule has a $C_{3}$ principal axis and three $\\sigma_{v}$ planes, with no $\\sigma_{h}$, no $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $C_{3}$, and no inversion center. This set of symmetry elements defines the point group $C_{3v}$.\n\nTherefore, among the options, the correct choice is $C_{3v}$, which corresponds to option B. For comparison, the meridional isomer of $[\\text{Co(NH}_{3})_{3}\\text{Cl}_{3}]$ has point group $C_{2v}$, not applicable here.

The geometric center of the molecule is at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The two boron atoms lie on the $z$-axis, positioned symmetrically with respect to the origin.

This swaps the bridging H at $(\\pm a,0,0)$, leaves boron positions invariant as a set, and maps terminal H in the $yz$-plane to symmetry-equivalent positions. Hence $C_{2}(z)$ exists.\n- About the $x$-axis: $C_{2}(x)$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,-y,-z)$. This interchanges the two boron atoms, maps terminal H appropriately within the $yz$-plane, and leaves each bridging H fixed (since $y=z=0$). Hence $C_{2}(x)$ exists.\n- About the $y$-axis: $C_{2}(y)$ is $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,y,-z)$.
