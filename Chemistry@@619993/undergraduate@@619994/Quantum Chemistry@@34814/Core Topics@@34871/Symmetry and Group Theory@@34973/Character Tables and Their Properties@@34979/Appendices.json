Activity in Raman spectroscopy requires that the irreducible representation transforms as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2$, $y^2$, $z^2$, $xy$, $xz$, or $yz$).\n\nThe character table for the $D_{3h}$ point group provides the necessary information. The irreducible representations and their relevant basis functions are as follows:\n- $A'_1$: transforms as $x^2+y^2, z^2$\n- $A'_2$: transforms as $R_z$ (a rotation, not a coordinate or quadratic function)\n- $E'$: transforms as the pair $(x, y)$ and also as the pair $(x^2-y^2, xy)$\n- $A''_1$: has no simple function basis\n- $A''_2$: transforms as $z$\n- $E''$: transforms as the pair $(xz, yz)$\n\nBased solely on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the possibility of a vibrational mode of ZY$_3$ being simultaneously active in both IR and Raman spectroscopy?\n\nA.

This directly demonstrates that simultaneous IR and Raman activity is possible in $D_{3h}$.\n\nRegarding mutual exclusion: the mutual exclusion rule (that no mode can be both IR and Raman active) applies to centrosymmetric point groups, i.e., those with an inversion center $i$. In such groups, $x$, $y$, $z$ are ungerade while quadratic functions are gerade, and a single irreducible representation cannot be both gerade and ungerade.
