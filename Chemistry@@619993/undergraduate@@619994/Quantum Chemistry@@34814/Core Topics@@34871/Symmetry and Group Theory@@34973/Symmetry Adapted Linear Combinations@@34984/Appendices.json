For a symmetry operation $g$, the reducible representation character $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(g)$ equals the trace of the transformation matrix on this basis. In this labeling-by-atom basis, a basis vector contributes to the trace only if its hydrogen atom is left in place by $g$; it contributes $+1$ if the displacement direction along the bond axis is preserved and $-1$ if it is reversed. If the atom is moved to a different atom, the corresponding contribution to the trace is $0$.\n\nWe analyze each $D_{2h}$ operation in the standard orientation (molecule in $xy$-plane, C=C along $x$):\n\n1) $E$: All four hydrogens (and their bond-axis displacement vectors) are unchanged. Each contributes $+1$. Hence $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(E)=4$.\n\n2) $C_{2}(z)$: This is a 180-degree rotation about the $z$-axis, sending $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,-y,z)$.

No hydrogen lies on this axis; all hydrogens are permuted pairwise. Thus $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(C_{2}(x))=0$.\n\n5) $i$: Inversion through the molecular center sends $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)$. No hydrogen is at the inversion center; each hydrogen is mapped to a different hydrogen. Hence $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(i)=0$.\n\n6) $\\sigma(xy)$: Reflection in the molecular plane sends $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,y,-z)$. All atoms lie in the $xy$-plane ($z=0$), so each hydrogen is left in place. Each C–H bond axis lies in the $xy$-plane, so the in-plane displacement vectors are unchanged in direction. Each contributes $+1$, giving $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(\\sigma(xy))=4$.\n\n7) $\\sigma(xz)$: Reflection in the $xz$-plane sends $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,-y,z)$. No hydrogen lies in this plane (since the hydrogens have $y\\neq 0$); the two hydrogens on each carbon are interchanged.
