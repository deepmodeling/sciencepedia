This practice challenges you to think like an analytical detective, using the observed elution order of a carefully selected test mixture to deduce the polarity of an unknown stationary phase. By understanding how the functional groups of analytes interact with the column, you can transform a simple chromatogram into a definitive \"fingerprint\" of the column's chemical nature [@problem_id:1443510].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with identifying the nature of an unlabeled Gas Chromatography (GC) column. To do this, an equimolar test mixture is prepared containing three compounds: n-dodecane ($C_{12}H_{26}$), 4-decanone ($C_{10}H_{20}O$), and 1-nonanol ($C_9H_{19}OH$). These compounds are specifically chosen because they have very similar boiling points, ensuring that their separation is governed primarily by their interactions with the stationary phase rather than by their volatility.\n\nThe mixture is injected into the GC system, and the chromatogram shows three distinct peaks emerging at different times. The observed order of elution from the column is:\n1.  n-Dodecane\n2.  4-Decanone\n3.  1-Nonanol\n\nBased on this experimental result, determine the most likely characteristic of the stationary phase used in this unlabeled GC column.\n\nA.

An intermediate polarity stationary phase with strong $\\pi$-$\\pi$ interaction capabilities.", "solution": "We aim to infer the stationary-phase character from the elution order by invoking gas chromatography partitioning principles while eliminating volatility as the dominant factor (the three analytes have similar boiling points by design).\n\nIn capillary GC, the retention factor is defined as\n$$\nk'=\\frac{t_{R}-t_{M}}{t_{M}},\n$$\nwhere $t_{R}$ is the retention time and $t_{M}$ is the dead (hold-up) time. The retention factor is related to the distribution (partition) constant $K$ and the phase-volume ratio by\n$$\nk'=K\\,\\frac{V_{s}}{V_{m}},\n$$\nwith $K=C_{s}/C_{m}$, where $C_{s}$ and $C_{m}$ are the solute concentrations in the stationary and mobile phases, respectively, and $V_{s}$ and $V_{m}$ are the corresponding phase volumes. Thus, for a fixed column and temperature, larger $K$ implies larger $k'$ and hence longer $t_{R}$.\n\nBecause the analytes were chosen to have similar boiling points, differences in volatility (and thus vapor pressure) are minimized; therefore, differences in $K$ are governed primarily by specific solute–stationary phase interactions. The qualitative rule is “like dissolves like”: polar stationary phases yield larger $K$ for polar solutes due to dipole–dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions, whereas nonpolar stationary phases emphasize dispersive interactions and tend to retain nonpolar solutes more strongly when volatility dominates.\n\nAssess the relative polarity of the analytes:\n- n-Dodecane is nonpolar (hydrocarbon).\n- 4-Decanone is polar (carbonyl dipole, hydrogen-bond acceptor).\n- 1-Nonanol is strongly polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).\n\nOn a polar stationary phase, we therefore expect\n$$\nK(\\text{n-dodecane})<K(\\text{4-decanone})<K(\\text{1-nonanol}),\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nt_{R}(\\text{n-dodecane})<t_{R}(\\text{4-decanone})<t_{R}(\\text{1-nonanol}).\n$$\nThis exactly matches the observed elution order: n-dodecane first, 4-decanone second, 1-nonanol last. Hence, the stationary phase is most likely polar.\n\nCheck of alternatives:\n- A nonpolar stationary phase would not preferentially retain the most polar analyte; with similar boiling points, the observed strong increase in retention with polarity would not be expected.\n- A chiral stationary phase is irrelevant here because the analytes are not enantiomeric pairs; no chiral discrimination is probed.\n- Elution order cannot be attributed to molar mass alone; indeed, the heaviest (n-dodecane) elutes first, contradicting a mass-determined order.\n- $\\pi$-$\\pi$ interactions are not pertinent because none of the analytes have aromatic $\\pi$ systems.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent conclusion is that the stationary phase is polar.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1443510"}, {"introduction": "While elution order gives us qualitative information about a column's polarity, raw retention times are dependent on specific instrument conditions.

The operating conditions involve repeated injections of acidic samples and sustained operation at high temperature near the upper limit of the phase’s thermal stability. The observed chromatographic symptoms are broad and tailing peaks across most analytes, indicating loss of efficiency and increased secondary interactions, consistent with chemical degradation of the stationary phase.\n\nStep 1: Establish the chemically susceptible functionality.\n- PEG is a polyether. The key functional group is an ether linkage $R-O-R^{\\prime}$. Ethers are generally resistant to base, but are susceptible to acid-catalyzed cleavage at elevated temperatures via protonation to form an oxonium ion, followed by C–O bond cleavage.\n\nStep 2: Write the acid-catalyzed cleavage mechanism for a representative backbone segment.\n- Consider a segment $R-O-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-O-R^{\\prime}$ within the polymer.\n- Protonation (general acid catalysis):\n$$\nR-O-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-O-R^{\\prime} + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons R-O^{+}H-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-O-R^{\\prime}\n$$\n- Nucleophilic attack by trace $H_{2}O$ and cleavage (overall chain scission), regenerating the acid catalyst:\n$$\nR-O^{+}H-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-O-R^{\\prime} + H_{2}O \\to R-OH + HO-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-O-R^{\\prime} + H^{+}\n$$\nThis results in breaking the polymer chain into shorter oligomers and generating additional terminal hydroxyl groups.\n\nStep 3: Connect mechanism to observed performance loss.\n- Chain scission reduces molecular weight and cohesive film properties, increasing stationary phase bleed and decreasing efficiency, which manifests as broadened peaks.\n- New polar end groups ($-OH$) increase specific interactions with analytes and active sites, promoting peak tailing.\n- The rate of acid-catalyzed cleavage increases with both $[H^{+}]$ and temperature.

Moreover, the classical and most rapid degradation route for PEG under acid and heat is acid-catalyzed ether cleavage, not radical oxidation.\n- D (cross-linking via dehydration of terminal $-OH$): This would require condensation of rare end groups and typically strong acid catalysts; moreover, additional cross-linking tends to increase rigidity rather than cause the widespread chain scission and bleed that produce broad, tailing peaks. Commercial PEG phases are often already end-capped/cross-linked to some extent.\n- E (electrophilic aromatic substitution on fused silica): Fused silica is amorphous $\\text{SiO}_{2}$, not aromatic, so EAS is inapplicable.\n\nTherefore, given the polymer structure, acidic environment, and elevated temperature, the most probable mechanism is acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether linkages in the PEG backbone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1443520"}]}
