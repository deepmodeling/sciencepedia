The mixture to be separated contains three organic compounds of similar carbon chain length: n-pentane, pentan-2-one, and pentan-1-ol.

The fundamental chromatographic relation for the retention factor is\n$$\nk=\\frac{t_{R}-t_{M}}{t_{M}},\n$$\nand for a partitioning mechanism on a capillary column,\n$$\nk=K\\,\\frac{V_{s}}{V_{m}},\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the equilibrium partition coefficient between stationary and mobile phases, and $V_{s}$ and $V_{m}$ are the stationary and mobile phase volumes, respectively.
