The capillary column selected for the separation has a well-characterized maximum capacity of 50 ng for a single analyte; introducing a mass greater than this limit will cause significant column overload, resulting in a distorted, fronting peak shape. The standard solution has a deltamethrin concentration of 75 ng/µL. The chemist plans to inject a 1.0 µL volume. Two injection techniques are being considered:\n\n1.  **On-column injection:** This technique involves the direct injection of the liquid sample into the beginning of the capillary column at a low temperature, ensuring all of the analyte is deposited.\n2.  **Splitless injection:** This technique involves vaporizing the sample in a hot inlet. For the duration of the \"splitless period,\" the vapor is swept onto the column. After this period, a high purge flow (the split flow) is activated to flush the remaining contents of the inlet to waste. For the specific instrument, solvent, and analyte conditions, prior optimization studies have shown that this splitless injection method achieves a transfer efficiency of 60%, meaning only 60% of the injected analyte mass is actually transferred onto the column.\n\nBased on this information and the goal of achieving a sharp, symmetrical peak, which of the following statements correctly describes the expected outcome?\n\nA.
