This means it has six acidic protons that can be lost. Its structure consists of an ethylenediamine backbone with four carboxymethyl groups ($-CH_2COOH$). The two nitrogen atoms of the ethylenediamine backbone can also be protonated. Thus, the fully protonated species can be written as $H_6Y^{2+}$, where the $+2$ charge comes from the two protonated amine groups.\n\nThe process of deprotonation involves the loss of six protons ($H^{+}$). The first four protons are lost from the four carboxylic acid groups ($-COOH \\rightarrow -COO^{-}$), and the next two protons are lost from the two ammonium groups ($-NH_2^{+}- \\rightarrow -N-)$.\n\nLet's track the charge change. The starting species is $H_6Y^{2+}$. The loss of six protons ($6 H^{+}$) corresponds to the removal of a total charge of $+6$.\nThe charge of the fully deprotonated ligand, denoted as $Y^{n-}$, can be calculated as follows:\nInitial charge of $H_6Y^{2+}$ = +2\nCharge of 6 protons lost = 6 * (+1) = +6\nFinal charge of the ligand $Y^{n-}$ = (Initial charge) - (Charge lost) = (+2) - (+6) = -4.\nTherefore, the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand has a charge of -4, and its formula is $Y^{4-}$.\n\nNow, this ligand forms a 1:1 complex with a single magnesium ion. The magnesium ion is given as $Mg^{2+}$, which has a charge of +2.\n\nThe net charge of the resulting complex is the algebraic sum of the charges of the metal ion and the ligand.\nNet Charge = (Charge of $Mg^{2+}$) + (Charge of $Y^{4-}$)\nNet Charge = (+2) + (-4)\nNet Charge = -2\n\nThe resulting complex ion is $[Mg(Y)]^{2-}$.
