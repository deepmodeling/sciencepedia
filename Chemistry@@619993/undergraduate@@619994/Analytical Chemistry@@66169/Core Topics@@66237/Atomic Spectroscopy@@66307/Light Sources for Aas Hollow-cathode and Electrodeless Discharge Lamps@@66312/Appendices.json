The emission spectrum of a hollow-cathode lamp is a direct reflection of the elemental composition of its cathode material. This exercise presents a classic troubleshooting puzzle, asking you to identify the most plausible cause for a spectral impurity, thereby reinforcing your understanding of the fundamental sputtering and excitation mechanism within the lamp. [@problem_id:1454129]", "problem": "An analytical chemist is setting up a new Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). As part of the instrument validation, they are testing a new Hollow-Cathode Lamp (HCL) that is certified by the manufacturer to be a high-purity magnesium (Mg) lamp. The HCL contains a low pressure of neon as the inert fill gas.\n\nThe chemist places the Mg-HCL in the instrument, turns it on, and allows it to stabilize. Instead of immediately proceeding with a magnesium analysis, they decide to scan the lamp's emission spectrum. Surprisingly, when the monochromator is set to 213.9 nm, which is a primary analytical wavelength for zinc (Zn), a strong and sharp emission line is detected. The chemist has verified that the AAS instrument itself is functioning correctly and is free from contamination.\n\nGiven this observation, which of the following provides the most physically plausible explanation for the unexpected emission of zinc's characteristic radiation from the magnesium HCL?\n\nA. The high temperature of the discharge causes the neon fill gas to undergo nuclear fusion, producing trace amounts of excited zinc atoms.\n\nB. The material used to fabricate the lamp's cathode, while primarily magnesium, is not perfectly pure and contains a small amount of zinc as a contaminant.\n\nC. The tungsten wire used for the anode is contaminated with zinc, which is vaporized by the high current and enters the plasma discharge.\n\nD. Electrons in the plasma discharge are energetic enough to excite the inner-shell electrons of the magnesium atoms, causing them to emit radiation at a wavelength corresponding to that of zinc.\n\nE. The borosilicate glass envelope of the HCL contains zinc impurities, which are liberated into the gas phase by the intense ultraviolet radiation from the discharge and subsequently excited.", "solution": "We start from the operating principle of a hollow-cathode lamp (HCL). A noble gas (here, neon) at low pressure is ionized by an electrical discharge. The resulting positive ions are accelerated toward the negatively biased hollow cathode and sputter neutral atoms of the cathode material into the discharge. These sputtered atoms are then excited by electron impact in the plasma and emit their element-specific spectral lines upon relaxation. Therefore, the set of sharp emission lines observed from an HCL corresponds to the elemental composition of the cathode material (and any elements present as trace contaminants in that cathode).\n\nGiven that the unexpected emission is at $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, a primary analytical line for zinc, a physically consistent explanation is that zinc atoms are present in the sputtered vapor. Because sputtering predominantly originates from the cathode surface, any zinc impurities in the cathode will be efficiently introduced into the discharge and produce their characteristic radiation.\n\nWe now assess each option against this mechanism and basic physical constraints:\n\n- Option A posits nuclear fusion of the neon fill gas producing zinc. Fusion requires reaction energies and conditions many orders of magnitude beyond those present in a low-pressure electrical discharge. The discharge electron energies are on the order of electron volts, whereas fusion requires energies in the kiloelectron-volt to megaelectron-volt regime with extremely high temperatures and densities. Hence, neon fusion to zinc in an HCL is physically untenable.\n\n- Option B posits that the magnesium cathode contains a small amount of zinc. This is the most consistent explanation with HCL physics: positive-ion bombardment sputters whatever elements are present at the cathode surface. If zinc is present as a trace impurity, those zinc atoms will be sputtered, excited, and will emit at their characteristic wavelengths, including $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n- Option C suggests zinc contamination of the tungsten anode. In an HCL, sputtering and emission are dominated by the cathode; the anode is at positive potential and does not experience the same sputtering by positive ions. Electron bombardment of the anode does not efficiently sputter metal into the discharge, and standard HCL designs and operating conditions are specifically optimized for cathode sputtering. Thus, the anode is an implausible source of strong, sharp zinc lines.\n\n- Option D proposes that inner-shell excitations in magnesium produce radiation at zinc’s wavelength. Atomic line positions are element-specific because they arise from discrete energy-level differences unique to each element. A magnesium transition cannot reproduce a zinc line. Moreover, inner-shell (core-level) excitations correspond to much higher photon energies (X-ray regime), whereas $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is in the ultraviolet and corresponds to valence-level transitions. Using $E = h\\nu = hc/\\lambda$, a photon at $\\lambda = 213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ has an energy characteristic of UV electronic transitions, not inner-shell X-ray transitions. Therefore, magnesium cannot emit zinc’s $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ line via inner-shell excitation.\n\n- Option E suggests zinc impurities in the borosilicate glass envelope are liberated and excited. Borosilicate glass typically does not contain appreciable zinc, and even if trace amounts were present, the discharge region and sputtering dynamics do not favor liberation of free metallic zinc from the glass envelope into the plasma as a strong, sharp atomic emission source. The observed strong line is much more consistent with cathode-originating species.\n\nTherefore, the most physically plausible and standard explanation is that the cathode, while nominally magnesium, contains a small amount of zinc impurity that is sputtered and emits its characteristic radiation at $213.9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.
