Before setting up the experiment, the student needs to predict whether this specific molecular vibration will be detectable using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, or both. The decision depends on the fundamental selection rules associated with each technique.\n\nConsidering the selection rules for these two techniques, which of the following statements correctly describes the spectroscopic activity of the HCl stretching vibration?\n\nA. The vibration is IR-active only, because the bond stretch causes a change in the molecule's dipole moment, but the polarizability of the molecule remains constant throughout the vibration.\n\nB. The vibration is Raman-active only, because the bond stretch causes a change in the molecule's polarizability, but since the vibration is a simple stretch, the dipole moment does not change.\n\nC. The vibration is both IR-active and Raman-active, because the bond stretch causes a change in both the molecule's dipole moment and its polarizability.\n\nD. The vibration is neither IR-active nor Raman-active, because as a simple, linear molecule, its fundamental vibration is symmetric and does not meet the selection criteria for either technique.\n\nE.

In terms of the normal coordinate $Q$ for the mode, the selection rule is\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q} \\right)_{0} \\neq 0,\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dipole moment and the subscript $0$ denotes evaluation at the equilibrium geometry.\n\nFor a heteronuclear diatomic molecule such as HCl, the stretching vibration changes the internuclear distance $R$. The dipole moment $\\mu(R)$ depends on $R$ because the charge distribution and bond polarity vary with bond length. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mu}{dR} \\neq 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial Q} \\right)_{0} \\neq 0,\n$$\nso the HCl stretch is IR-active.\n\n2) Raman activity condition: A vibrational mode is Raman-active if the molecular polarizability tensor changes during the vibration.

HCl has no center of inversion, so a mode can be both IR- and Raman-active.\n\nConsequently, the HCl stretching vibration is both IR-active and Raman-active. Option A is incorrect because the polarizability does change with bond stretching. Option B is incorrect because the dipole moment does change during a heteronuclear bond stretch.

This exercise focuses on a key principle for molecules possessing a center of inversion: the Rule of Mutual Exclusion.

The molecule is centrosymmetric, meaning it possesses a center of inversion symmetry element ($i$).\n2. A specific vibrational mode is observed to be strong in the IR spectrum, meaning it is \"IR active\".\n\nThe relationship between IR and Raman activity for centrosymmetric molecules is governed by the **Rule of Mutual Exclusion**. This rule is a direct consequence of the symmetry properties of the vibrational modes.\n\nLet's break down the selection rules for IR and Raman spectroscopy:\n\n**1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Selection Rule:**\nA vibrational mode is IR active if and only if it causes a change in the net dipole moment of the molecule. From a group theory perspective, this means the irreducible representation of the vibrational normal mode must transform in the same way as one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x$, $y$, or $z$). In a molecule with a center of inversion, the Cartesian coordinates are antisymmetric with respect to the inversion operation. Such representations are labeled as *ungerade* (German for \"odd\"), often denoted with a 'u' subscript (e.g., $A_{u}$, $E_{1u}$). Therefore, for a centrosymmetric molecule, only *ungerade* modes can be IR active.\n\n**2. Raman Spectroscopy Selection Rule:**\nA vibrational mode is Raman active if and only if it causes a change in the polarizability of the molecule's electron cloud. From a group theory perspective, this means the irreducible representation of the vibrational normal mode must transform in the same way as one of the quadratic products ($x^2$, $y^2$, $z^2$, $xy$, $xz$, $yz$). In a molecule with a center of inversion, these quadratic products are symmetric with respect to the inversion operation. Such representations are labeled as *gerade* (German for \"even\"), often denoted with a 'g' subscript (e.g., $A_{1g}$, $E_{g}$). Therefore, for a centrosymmetric molecule, only *gerade* modes can be Raman active.\n\n**Applying the Rule of Mutual Exclusion:**\nSince a vibrational mode must belong to a single irreducible representation, it can be either *gerade* or *ungerade* (or neither, if it involves a combination of symmetry operations, but it cannot be both 'g' and 'u' simultaneously).\n- If a mode is *ungerade*, it can be IR active but must be Raman inactive.\n- If a mode is *gerade*, it can be Raman active but must be IR inactive.\n\nIn this problem, we are told that the molecule is centrosymmetric and that a particular vibrational mode at wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$ gives rise to a strong absorption in the IR spectrum. This confirms that this mode is IR active. According to the Rule of Mutual Exclusion, because this mode is IR active, it must be Raman inactive.\n\nIn an experimental context, \"inactive\" means that the transition is forbidden by the selection rules, and thus no signal should be observed. In practice, this translates to either a completely absent band or one that is extremely weak (often considered spectral noise level).\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The band will be absent or extremely weak. - This is the direct consequence of the Rule of Mutual Exclusion for a known IR-active mode in a centrosymmetric molecule. This is the correct prediction.\nB. The band will appear with strong intensity, similar to its IR absorption. - This would imply that the selection rules for IR and Raman are the same, which is incorrect, especially for a centrosymmetric molecule.\nC. The band will be observable, but its intensity is fundamentally unpredictable relative to the IR spectrum. - While predicting relative intensities can be complex, for a centrosymmetric molecule, the activity (present vs. absent) is predictable. This option incorrectly suggests the band will be observable.\nD. and E. These options confuse the concept of a Raman *shift* with the activity of a band. The Raman spectrum plots intensity versus the Raman shift. The Raman shift *is* the wavenumber of the vibrational mode ($\\tilde{\\nu}$). These options incorrectly suggest the band's position will move, when the real question is about its intensity at that position.\n\nTherefore, the correct prediction is that the band corresponding to the IR-active mode will be absent or extremely weak in the Raman spectrum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1432044"}, {"introduction": "To move beyond simple cases, chemists use the formal language of group theory to analyze molecular vibrations.
