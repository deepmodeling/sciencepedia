An ideal pellet is transparent, behaving like a glass window that allows infrared light to pass through the sample with minimal interference. This exercise explores the most common reason for a failed preparation—an opaque, white pellet—and asks you to diagnose the procedural error by considering the physics of light scattering.", "problem": "An undergraduate chemistry student is preparing a solid organic compound for analysis using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The student employs the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet technique. The procedure involves thoroughly grinding a small amount of the solid sample with spectroscopic-grade KBr powder in an agate mortar and pestle, transferring the resulting fine powder into a pellet die, and applying high pressure using a hydraulic press. Upon removing the disc from the die, the student observes that the pellet is mechanically stable and does not crumble, but it is opaque and has a uniform, milky-white appearance instead of the desired transparent, glass-like quality.\n\nWhich of the following procedural errors is the most likely reason for the pellet's opaque and white appearance?\n\nA. The die was not cleaned properly and was contaminated with a previous sample.\n\nB. The KBr and sample mixture was not ground to a sufficiently fine particle size before pressing.\n\nC. The pressure applied to the die was too high, causing excessive fracturing of the KBr crystal lattice.\n\nD. The amount of solid sample mixed with the KBr was too low, resulting in a concentration below the detection limit.\n\nE. The KBr was contaminated with atmospheric water due to its hygroscopic nature.", "solution": "We are asked to identify the most likely procedural error that causes a mechanically stable KBr pellet to appear opaque and milky-white rather than transparent.\n\nPrinciple: Transparency of a KBr pellet depends on minimizing light scattering within the pellet. Scattering arises from refractive index discontinuities such as large crystallites, poor compaction that traps voids, and heterogeneities. For particulate media, when particle diameter $d$ is comparable to the probing wavelength $\\lambda$ (visible or infrared), Mie scattering is strong, causing opacity. When particles are sufficiently small, $d \\ll \\lambda$, scattering approaches the Rayleigh regime with intensity scaling as $I \\propto d^{6}\\lambda^{-4}$, so transparency improves markedly. Thorough grinding reduces $d$ and homogenizes the mixture, minimizing scattering and improving transparency.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Die contamination introduces extraneous chemical species, which would add spurious absorbance bands in the FTIR spectrum. It does not systematically increase elastic light scattering through the entire pellet, so it is not the primary cause of a uniform milky-white appearance. The pellet could still be clear but spectrally contaminated.\n\nB. If the KBr and sample are not ground to a sufficiently fine and homogeneous mixture, the particle size remains too large, $d \\sim \\lambda$, and interfaces remain abundant, leading to strong Mie scattering and a uniformly opaque, milky pellet. Insufficient grinding also leaves microvoids that further increase scattering. This directly matches the observed appearance while allowing the pellet to remain mechanically intact.\n\nC. Excessively high pressure generally improves optical clarity by better compaction and sintering of KBr, reducing voids. If pressure were so high as to cause microfracturing, one would expect cracks and reduced mechanical integrity. The pellet here is mechanically stable; moreover, excessive pressure is not the typical cause of uniform milkiness.\n\nD. Too little sample lowers absorbance of analyte bands, but the optical body of the pellet is dominated by KBr, which is transparent when properly prepared. This would tend to increase, not decrease, transparency; it does not explain the milky appearance.\n\nE. Hygroscopic uptake of water by KBr can degrade pellet quality, introducing broad water bands and sometimes cloudiness. However, the hallmark effect is spectral interference (broad O–H features) and potential mechanical issues, not necessarily a uniformly milky-white pellet if grinding and compaction are otherwise optimal. While moisture can contribute to cloudiness, the most direct and common cause of the described uniform opacity is inadequate grinding leading to large particle sizes and trapped voids.\n\nConclusion: The most likely procedural error is that the KBr and sample were not ground to a sufficiently fine particle size, causing strong scattering and an opaque, milky-white pellet.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468562"}, {"introduction": "Beyond achieving the physical transparency discussed previously [@problem_id:1468562], a spectroscopist must also be vigilant for chemical contamination that introduces spurious peaks into the spectrum. Potassium bromide (KBr) is notoriously hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. This practice problem challenges you to identify the spectral signature of water contamination, a crucial skill for distinguishing sample features from experimental artifacts.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with obtaining an Infrared (IR) spectrum of a solid sample, hexachlorobenzene ($C_{6}Cl_{6}$), which is known to be anhydrous and contains no hydrogen atoms. The student prepares a sample for analysis by grinding a small amount of the analyte with potassium bromide (KBr) powder and pressing the mixture into a transparent pellet. Upon analyzing the pellet, the resulting IR spectrum shows the characteristic peaks for hexachlorobenzene, but it also displays an unexpectedly strong and broad absorption band centered at approximately $3400 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$.

The presence of atmospheric carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_{2}$) in the spectrometer's sample chamber.\n\nB. The KBr powder used to prepare the pellet was hygroscopic and absorbed residual water from the air.\n\nC. An N-H stretching vibration from an unexpected amine contaminant in the hexachlorobenzene sample.\n\nD. A C-H aromatic stretching vibration from a different, related aromatic compound impurity.\n\nE. The pellet was pressed with too much force, causing a shift in the fundamental vibrations of the KBr lattice.", "solution": "We begin by identifying the key observation: an unexpectedly strong and broad absorption centered near $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ appears in the IR spectrum of a KBr pellet containing hexachlorobenzene. Hexachlorobenzene, $C_{6}Cl_{6}$, is anhydrous and contains no hydrogen atoms, so it cannot give rise to intrinsic O–H or N–H stretches.\n\nThe characteristic IR regions relevant here are:\n- O–H stretching vibrations: typically broad and strong due to hydrogen bonding, centered in the range $3200$ to $3600\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, often around $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ in condensed phases.\n- N–H stretching vibrations: typically in the $3300$ to $3500\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ region; primary amines often show a pair of sharper bands, and these are not expected without nitrogen in the sample.\n- Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations: typically near $3030\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, not at $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n- Atmospheric $\\text{CO}_{2}$: strong asymmetric stretch near $2350\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and a bending mode near $667\\text{ cm}^{-1}$; not near $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n- KBr lattice modes: far-IR; pressing force does not create a strong, broad band at $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n\nGiven these assignments, a broad, strong band near $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ is diagnostic of O–H stretching from hydrogen-bonded water. KBr is known to be hygroscopic; it readily absorbs water from ambient air. Water incorporated in the KBr pellet produces a broad O–H stretching band in this region. This explains both the position and the broadness of the extra absorption. In contrast:\n- Option A is inconsistent because $\\text{CO}_{2}$ does not absorb near $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n- Option C is unlikely because there is no nitrogen source; furthermore, N–H bands are typically sharper and show characteristic patterns (e.g., primary amine doublet).\n- Option D is inconsistent with the position, since aromatic C–H stretches occur near $3030\\text{ cm}^{-1}$.\n- Option E is not physically plausible for generating a broad O–H-like band at $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$; KBr lattice fundamentals are in the far-IR and pressing does not shift modes into this region.\n\nTherefore, the most probable explanation is that the KBr pellet contains absorbed water, yielding the broad O–H stretching band near $3400\\text{ cm}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468592"}, {"introduction": "While KBr pellets are a powerful tool, they are not universally applicable; some samples may react with the alkali halide matrix or be too sensitive for the high pressures involved. In such cases, the mull technique provides an essential alternative. This final exercise presents a complex scenario where you must choose the appropriate sample preparation method by weighing multiple factors—including chemical reactivity, thermal stability, and the inherent spectral limitations of different mulling agents—to devise a comprehensive analytical plan.", "problem": "You are an analytical chemist tasked with obtaining a high-quality Infrared (IR) spectrum of a newly synthesized, air-stable solid, designated 'Complex P'. The primary goal is to obtain a complete spectrum from $4000 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ to $650 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ to confirm its structure.\n\nFrom preliminary data and theoretical calculations, you have the following information about Complex P:\n1.  It is a solid at room temperature.\n2.  The two most structurally significant vibrational modes are a carbonyl (C=O) stretch expected near $1685 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and a nitrile (C≡N) stretch expected near $2240 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. It is also expected to have aliphatic C-H bonds.\n3.  The complex is thermally sensitive and begins to irreversibly decompose at temperatures exceeding 60 °C.\n4.  An initial attempt to prepare a sample using a standard potassium bromide (KBr) pellet press resulted in a visible color change of the sample. The resulting IR spectrum failed to show the expected nitrile peak at $2240 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$, suggesting a chemical reaction with the alkali halide matrix under pressure.\n\nYou have the following mulling agents available for an alternative sample preparation method:\n*   **Nujol:** A mineral oil primarily composed of long-chain alkanes.

Prepare a single mull of Complex P using Nujol only and record the spectrum.\n\nB. Prepare a single mull of Complex P using Fluorolube only and record the spectrum.\n\nC. Prepare a KBr pellet, but grind the sample and KBr together in a mortar chilled with liquid nitrogen before pressing to prevent the decomposition reaction.\n\nD. Prepare two separate mulls of Complex P: one with Nujol and one with Fluorolube. Record the spectrum of each and then digitally combine the transparent regions to create a composite spectrum.\n\nE. Dissolve Complex P in a suitable solvent and record the spectrum in a solution cell.", "solution": "The objective is to obtain a complete IR spectrum from $4000\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ for a solid, air-stable, thermally sensitive sample that showed evidence of chemical reaction with an alkali halide matrix under pressure. The diagnostically important bands are expected near $1685\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ ($C=O$) and $2240\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ ($C\\equiv N$), with additional aliphatic C–H features.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- The sample begins to decompose irreversibly above $60^\\circ\\text{C}$, so methods that introduce heat or friction must be minimized or avoided.\n- The failed KBr pellet (color change, loss of the nitrile band at $2240\\text{ cm}^{-1}$) indicates a pressure- or matrix-induced chemical reaction with the alkali halide, independent of thermal decomposition, so alkali halide pellets are contraindicated.\n- The requirement is a complete, reliable spectrum across the full range $4000$ to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, not just detection of the two key modes.\n\nEvaluate each option against spectral transparency windows and chemical compatibility:\n\nA. Nujol mull only. Nujol exhibits strong, broad absorptions in the C–H stretch region $3000$ to $2850\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and strong bends at approximately $1460$ and $1375\\text{ cm}^{-1}$. While the $2240\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ ($C\\equiv N$) and $1685\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ (C=O) bands would likely be observable, this approach cannot deliver a complete spectrum because significant regions ($3000$ to $2850\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and around $1460$ and $1375\\text{ cm}^{-1}$) are obscured. Therefore, it fails the completeness requirement.\n\nB. Fluorolube mull only. Fluorolube is transparent above $1350\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, so the $2240\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and $1685\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ bands and the C–H stretches can be recorded cleanly. However, it exhibits strong C–F absorptions that obscure the entire region below $1350\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, preventing acquisition of the fingerprint region down to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Hence, it also fails the completeness requirement.\n\nC. KBr pellet with cryogenic grinding. The prior failure indicates a chemical reaction with the alkali halide matrix under high pressure, as evidenced by a visible color change and loss of the nitrile band. Cooling the mortar with liquid nitrogen may suppress thermally driven decomposition but does not address pressure-induced or matrix-facilitated chemical reactions. The pellet pressing step still applies high pressure, so the risk of reaction remains high. This is therefore not appropriate.\n\nD. Two mulls, one in Nujol and one in Fluorolube, then digitally combine transparent regions. Fluorolube provides a clean spectrum from $4000$ to $1350\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, covering the C–H stretches, the $C\\equiv N$ near $2240\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, and the C=O near $1685\\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Nujol is relatively transparent below $1350\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ (its strong bands are at approximately $1460$ and $1375\\text{ cm}^{-1}$, above this lower window), allowing access to the fingerprint region down to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$. By recording both spectra and compositing the transparent regions—use Fluorolube for $4000$ to $1350\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and Nujol for $1350$ to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$—one obtains a complete spectrum. This avoids reactive alkali halide matrices and minimizes thermal/mechanical stress, satisfying the thermal sensitivity constraint. It directly addresses the goal of a complete and reliable spectrum.\n\nE. Solution IR. Dissolution introduces risks of solvolysis, coordination changes, or conformational changes relative to the solid state, potentially altering vibrational frequencies and intensities. Suitable solvents typically have strong absorptions that complicate acquisition of an unperturbed, complete spectrum across $4000$ to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ with reasonable path lengths. Since the sample is air-stable solid and solid-state methods are available that avoid matrix reactions, solution IR is not the most appropriate strategy here.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate experimental strategy is to prepare two separate mulls, one in Nujol and one in Fluorolube, and combine their transparent regions to yield a complete, reliable spectrum from $4000$ to $650\\text{ cm}^{-1}$ while avoiding KBr-induced reactions and thermal stress.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1468543"}]}
