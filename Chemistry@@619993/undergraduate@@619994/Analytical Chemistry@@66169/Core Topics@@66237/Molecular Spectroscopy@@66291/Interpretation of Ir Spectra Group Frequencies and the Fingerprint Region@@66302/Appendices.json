The student decides to use Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, a technique that measures the absorption of infrared radiation by a molecule's vibrations. A vibration is IR-active, meaning it produces a signal, only if it causes a change in the molecule's net dipole moment. Both 1-hexyne and 3-hexyne are isomers with the chemical formula C₆H₁₀.

The governing physical principle is the IR selection rule: a vibrational mode is IR-active only if it produces a change in the molecular dipole moment during the vibration. For alkynes, two characteristic regions are relevant:\n- The $\\mathrm{C}\\equiv \\mathrm{C}$ stretching vibration, typically weak to medium, appears in the $2100$ to $2260\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ region and can be very weak or even IR-inactive for symmetric internal alkynes because the dipole moment change is small.\n- The terminal alkyne $\\equiv \\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ stretching vibration is a strong, sharp band near $3300\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, arising from an $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ bond present only in terminal alkynes.\n\nIdentify structural differences:\n- 1-hexyne is a terminal alkyne and contains an $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ bond; therefore, it exhibits a strong, sharp $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ stretch near $3300\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n- 3-hexyne is an internal alkyne and lacks any $\\mathrm{sp}$ $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ bond; therefore, it does not exhibit this $3300\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band.\n\nEvaluate the options:\nA. Strong $\\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ stretching in $2850$ to $3000\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ occurs for alkyl groups present in both isomers; not distinguishing.\nB.

In particular, the carbonyl stretch is a strong, diagnostic band whose position is sensitive to functional group type and conjugation, and coupling between adjacent carbonyls can split the band into two distinct absorptions corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes.\n\n1) The spectrum exhibits two very strong, sharp peaks in the carbonyl region at $1810\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $1760\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. A pair of strong C=O absorptions in this high-frequency region is the hallmark of an acid anhydride. In an anhydride, two adjacent carbonyl groups are coupled; their symmetric and asymmetric C=O stretching modes appear as two distinct strong bands typically near $1820\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $1760\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$. This directly points to an anhydride functionality.\n\n2) The presence of medium-to-strong absorptions between $2850\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and $2980\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ is consistent with aliphatic $\\text{sp}^{3}$ C–H stretching, which is expected for common aliphatic derivatives of all candidates.

This argues against the presence of O–H (alcohols and especially the very broad carboxylic acid O–H, which typically spans roughly $2500$–$3300\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and would usually be noticeable) and against N–H stretches (typically sharp bands near $3300\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ for amides and amines). The absence of N–H is consistent with an anhydride and inconsistent with a secondary amide such as N-methylbutanamide.\n\n4) Evaluate each option against these features:\n- A. Pentanoic acid: Expected a single C=O near $1710\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ and a very broad O–H band roughly $2500$–$3300\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.

This exactly matches the data.\n- C. 2-Pentanone: Expected a single strong C=O near $1715\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$, not two peaks at higher frequency. Inconsistent.\n- D. Ethyl propanoate: Expected a single ester C=O near $1735\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ (plus C–O stretches in the $1000$–$1300\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$ region), not a pair at $1810$ and $1760\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$.
