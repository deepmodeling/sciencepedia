The instrument uses a xenon arc lamp as a broadband light source and two diffraction grating-based monochromators, one for selecting the excitation wavelength and one for scanning the emission spectrum. The researcher sets the excitation wavelength to 325 nm and records the emission spectrum. In addition to the expected broad fluorescence from the compound, a small but very sharp peak appears in the spectrum at a wavelength of exactly 650 nm. The researcher suspects this is an instrumental artifact rather than a true feature of the compound.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and common explanation for the origin of this sharp peak at 650 nm?\n\nA. Rayleigh scattering of the 325 nm excitation light, which is incorrectly plotted by the instrument's software at twice its actual wavelength.\n\nB. The fluorescent compound undergoes a two-photon absorption of the 325 nm light, leading to an emission at 650 nm.\n\nC. The emission monochromator, while mechanically set to scan for 650 nm light, is also passing Rayleigh-scattered excitation light (at 325 nm) due to second-order diffraction.\n\nD. Raman scattering by the water solvent, where the energy shift coincidentally corresponds to exactly half the energy of the excitation photons.\n\nE.

This is a well-known and common grating second-order artifact, typically mitigated by order-sorting (long-pass) filters in the emission path.\n\nBy contrast:\n- A: Software doubling of wavelength is not the standard cause; the optical second-order mechanism explains the exact factor-of-two relation physically via the grating equation.\n- B: Two-photon absorption requires very high irradiance not provided by a xenon arc lamp and would produce fluorescence bands, not a razor-sharp line coincident with exactly twice the excitation wavelength.\n- D: Raman scattering follows $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{em}}=\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{ex}}-\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$ with a fixed vibrational shift $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$ independent of excitation wavelength; an exact half-energy relation $\\lambda_{\\text{em}}=2\\lambda_{\\text{ex}}$ would imply $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}=\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{ex}}/2$, which is not a fixed solvent vibrational constant.\n- E: There is no creation of a second harmonic by the lamp or excitation monochromator; moreover, for the excitation monochromator set at $325\\,\\text{nm}$, second order would correspond to transmitting $\\lambda=162.5\\,\\text{nm}$, not $650\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nThus the most accurate and common explanation is second-order transmission of Rayleigh-scattered excitation light by the emission monochromator, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1448165"}, {"introduction": "A stable signal is crucial for reliable fluorescence measurements, but sometimes the very act of measuring can alter the sample itself.

Thus, internal conversion (option B) and collisional quenching (option E) would set the fluorescence level but would not produce a continuous, irreversible decay over minutes if conditions are steady; collisional quenching follows the Sternâ€“Volmer relation\n$$\n\\frac{I_{0}}{I} = 1 + K_{\\text{SV}}[Q], \\quad K_{\\text{SV}} = k_{q}\\tau_{0},\n$$\nwhich is constant for fixed $[Q]$ and does not imply a time drift.\n\nRayleigh scattering (option A) is elastic scattering at the excitation wavelength and does not irreversibly deplete $N(t)$ or cause a monotonic decay in detected fluorescence at a fixed emission wavelength. Phosphorescence (option C) is emission from the triplet state and would manifest as delayed emission at typically longer wavelengths; it does not cause the fluorescence signal to irreversibly decrease.\n\nUnder sustained high excitation, the population of intact fluorophores $N(t)$ can decrease due to irreversible photochemical reactions, i.e., photobleaching. Photobleaching is well described by a first-order loss process under constant illumination:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -k_{b} N(t) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N(t) = N_{0}\\exp(-k_{b} t),\n$$\nwith a bleaching rate constant $k_{b}$.
