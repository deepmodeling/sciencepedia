The ATR accessory uses a zinc selenide (ZnSe) crystal, which is transparent in the mid-infrared region. The student places a small mound of the powder onto the crystal surface and acquires a spectrum. The resulting spectrum is of very poor quality, characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio and extremely weak, almost indistinguishable, absorption bands. The instrument was functioning correctly for a liquid sample analyzed just minutes before.\n\nWhich of the following is the most probable cause for the poor quality of the powder's spectrum?\n\nA. Inadequate pressure was applied, resulting in poor physical contact between the powder and the ATR crystal.\n\nB. The infrared detector was saturated by the strong signal from the reflective powder.\n\nC. The sample is a pure solid and is therefore \"too concentrated\" for ATR analysis, causing non-linear signal response.\n\nD. The powder particles are scattering the infrared light away from the detector.\n\nE. The ZnSe crystal is chemically reacting with the organic powder, degrading the signal.", "solution": "In attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, the infrared beam propagates inside a high-refractive-index crystal (here ZnSe with refractive index $n_{1}$) and undergoes total internal reflection at the interface with the sample (refractive index $n_{2}$), provided the incidence angle $\\theta$ inside the crystal exceeds the critical angle. This condition follows from Snell’s law,\n$$\nn_{1}\\sin\\theta = n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{2},\n$$\nand the total internal reflection criterion $\\theta > \\theta_{c}$ with\n$$\n\\sin\\theta_{c} = \\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}.\n$$\nAt total internal reflection, an evanescent field extends into the sample with an amplitude that decays exponentially with distance $z$ normal to the interface. The penetration depth $d_{p}$ is defined such that the field amplitude decays as $\\exp(-z/d_{p})$, and is given by\n$$\nd_{p} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi n_{1}\\sqrt{\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\left(\\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\\right)^{2}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the vacuum wavelength. The intensity in the sample therefore decays as $\\exp(-2z/d_{p})$, and the absorbance in ATR is approximately proportional to the effective interaction pathlength, which scales with $d_{p}$ and the number of reflections.\n\nFor a dry powder, effective ATR absorbance critically depends on intimate physical contact between particles and the crystal so that the evanescent field penetrates into the solid. If there is an air gap of thickness $g$ at the interface (due to inadequate pressure or poor packing), the evanescent field must traverse the gap before reaching the sample. The field amplitude at the sample surface is then reduced by a factor $\\exp(-g/d_{p})$, and the intensity by $\\exp(-2g/d_{p})$, which drastically reduces the absorption signal and yields weak bands and low signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nLiquids usually wet the crystal and provide conformal contact, so a spectrum taken minutes earlier on a liquid appears normal, consistent with proper instrument function. In contrast, finely ground powders can sit loosely and form micron-scale gaps unless pressed firmly with the ATR pressure device, leading to the observed poor spectrum.\n\nConsideration of the alternatives:\n- B is unlikely: detector saturation from a reflective powder would not produce extremely weak bands; saturation typically causes clipping or distorted baselines, not low absorbance.\n- C is incorrect: ATR routinely measures pure solids; non-linear response from “too concentrated” samples would manifest as band distortion at high absorbance, not extremely weak signals.\n- D is not the dominant mechanism in ATR: scattering in the bulk sample is far less relevant because the beam is confined in the crystal and only the evanescent field interacts locally; poor contact dominates the loss of signal.\n- E is improbable: ZnSe is generally compatible with organic powders; deleterious reactions are more associated with strong acids or bases, not inert organic solids.\n\nTherefore, the most probable cause is inadequate pressure leading to poor contact between the powder and the ATR crystal.\n\nHence the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1425525"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply obtaining a spectrum, a skilled analyst can tailor an ATR experiment to probe a specific depth within a sample.
