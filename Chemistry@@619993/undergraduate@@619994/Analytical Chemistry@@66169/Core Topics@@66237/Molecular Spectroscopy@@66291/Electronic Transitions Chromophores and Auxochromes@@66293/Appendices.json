An auxochrome is a functional group attached to a chromophore that modifies the chromophore's ability to absorb light, typically altering the wavelength and intensity of absorption. Consider the aromatic amine, aniline ($C_6H_5NH_2$), which consists of a phenyl group attached to an amino group. When aniline is dissolved in a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), it is protonated to form the anilinium ion ($C_6H_5NH_3^+$).\n\nThe absorption of UV radiation by these molecules corresponds to a $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^*$ electronic transition within the benzene ring chromophore. Predict which species, aniline or the anilinium ion, will absorb light at a longer wavelength ($\\lambda_{max}$) and select the option that provides the correct reasoning.\n\nA.
