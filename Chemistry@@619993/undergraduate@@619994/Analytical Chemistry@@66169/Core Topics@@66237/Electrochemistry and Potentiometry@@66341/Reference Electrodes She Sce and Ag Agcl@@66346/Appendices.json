Both electrodes are designed to maintain a stable potential by utilizing a redox couple in equilibrium with a solution containing a fixed concentration of chloride ions. In this case, both electrodes are filled with a solution saturated with potassium chloride (KCl).\n\nThe half-reaction for the SCE is:\n$$ \\text{Hg}_2\\text{Cl}_2(s) + 2e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{Hg}(l) + 2\\text{Cl}^-(aq) $$\nThe half-reaction for the Ag/AgCl electrode is:\n$$ \\text{AgCl}(s) + e^- \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ag}(s) + \\text{Cl}^-(aq) $$\n\nLet $E^\\circ_{\\text{SCE}}$ and $E^\\circ_{\\text{Ag/AgCl}}$ represent the standard electrode potentials for these half-reactions, respectively, which are defined at a chloride ion concentration of 1 M.

The relationship is opposite to the relationship between their standard potentials.\n\nE. The relationship cannot be determined without knowing the exact solubility of KCl and the temperature.", "solution": "We consider each half-reaction and apply the Nernst equation using activities. For a general reduction half-reaction, the electrode potential relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) is given by\n$$\nE = E^{\\circ} - \\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln Q,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of electrons transferred and $Q$ is the reaction quotient written in terms of activities.\n\nFor the SCE:\n$$\n\\text{Hg}_{2}\\text{Cl}_{2}(s) + 2e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{Hg}(l) + 2\\text{Cl}^{-}(aq).\n$$\nThe reaction quotient is $Q_{\\text{SCE}} = a_{\\text{Cl}^{-}}^{2}$, because the activities of the pure solid and liquid phases are unity.

This practice problem shifts our focus from the chemistry of the half-cell to the physical and practical aspects of electrode maintenance and troubleshooting [@problem_id:1467677]. You are asked to diagnose the cause of an anomalously high resistance in an electrochemical cell, a common issue in the lab that requires connecting theoretical knowledge to real-world equipment failure.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is performing a potentiometric titration and has set up an electrochemical cell consisting of a glass pH indicator electrode and a Silver/Silver Chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode. The Ag/AgCl electrode consists of a silver wire coated with silver chloride, immersed in a filling solution of saturated potassium chloride (KCl). This internal assembly is contained within a glass body that makes contact with the external analyte solution through a porous ceramic frit. Before starting the titration, the student uses a high-impedance multimeter to check the resistance of the complete cell and measures an unexpectedly high value, on the order of several megaohms ($10^6 \\Omega$). A properly functioning cell of this type should typically exhibit a resistance in the range of a few kiloohms ($10^3 \\Omega$).\n\nWhich of the following options presents the most probable cause for this anomalously high electrical resistance?\n\nA. The concentration of the saturated KCl filling solution has decreased slightly due to water evaporation.\n\nB. The silver wire of the reference electrode has become partially tarnished by trace sulfide impurities.\n\nC. The porous ceramic frit has become clogged with silver chloride precipitate or has dried out.\n\nD. The surface of the glass pH electrode has a layer of adsorbed protein from a previous experiment.\n\nE. The temperature of the analyte solution is 15 °C instead of the standard 25 °C.", "solution": "We identify the measured quantity as the total ohmic resistance of the ionic path connecting the two half-cells. In a potentiometric cell with a reference electrode that contacts the analyte through a porous frit, the dominant resistive elements are the porous junction and the solution path between the electrodes. The total resistance can be modeled as a series sum\n$$\nR_{\\text{total}}=R_{\\text{junction}}+R_{\\text{solution}}+R_{\\text{other}},\n$$\nwhere $R_{\\text{junction}}$ is the resistance of the porous frit (liquid junction), $R_{\\text{solution}}$ is the bulk solution resistance, and $R_{\\text{other}}$ includes any minor interfacial contributions that are not rate-limiting for ion transport. For an electrolyte-filled porous frit, the junction resistance is governed by\n$$\nR_{\\text{junction}}=\\rho_{\\text{eff}}\\frac{l_{\\text{eff}}}{A_{\\text{eff}}}, \\quad \\rho_{\\text{eff}}=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective ionic conductivity within the porous network, $l_{\\text{eff}}$ is an effective tortuous path length, and $A_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective cross-sectional area available for ion transport. Any process that greatly reduces $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}$ (e.g., drying) or reduces $A_{\\text{eff}}$ and increases $l_{\\text{eff}}$ (e.g., clogging/precipitation in pores) will cause $R_{\\text{junction}}$ to increase dramatically, potentially by orders of magnitude.\n\nWe now assess each option against the observed jump from a few $10^{3}\\ \\Omega$ to several $10^{6}\\ \\Omega$:\n\nA. Slight decrease in the concentration of a saturated KCl filling solution due to water evaporation is internally inconsistent (evaporation of water tends to increase concentration until saturation; a saturated solution remains saturated as long as solid is present). Even if the concentration changed slightly, the conductivity $\\kappa$ of concentrated KCl varies smoothly with concentration; the resistance change obeys $R\\propto 1/\\kappa$, so small concentration changes cannot produce a $10^{3}$-fold increase. Thus A cannot account for the observed megohm resistance.\n\nB. Partial tarnishing (formation of Ag_{2}S or related surface films) on the Ag wire affects the equilibrium potential (Ag/AgCl reference potential) more than the ohmic resistance of the ionic path. Electron transfer at a metal electrode is typically fast, and any added interfacial resistance is negligible compared to ionic transport through the junction. This will not raise $R_{\\text{total}}$ by three orders of magnitude.\n\nC. A clogged or dried porous ceramic frit directly targets $R_{\\text{junction}}$. Clogging with AgCl precipitate reduces $A_{\\text{eff}}$ and increases tortuosity $l_{\\text{eff}}$, yielding\n$$\nR_{\\text{junction}}\\propto \\frac{l_{\\text{eff}}}{A_{\\text{eff}}}\\uparrow,\n$$\nwhile drying removes the continuous aqueous phase, driving $\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}\\to 0$ and hence $\\rho_{\\text{eff}}\\to \\infty$, so\n$$\nR_{\\text{junction}}=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_{\\text{eff}}}\\frac{l_{\\text{eff}}}{A_{\\text{eff}}}\\to \\infty.\n$$\nEither mechanism can elevate the resistance from $10^{3}\\ \\Omega$ to $10^{6}\\ \\Omega$ or more. This matches the observation.\n\nD. An adsorbed protein layer on the glass pH electrode surface primarily affects the electrode response (sluggishness, drift) by altering ion exchange at the hydrated gel layer. It does not create a severe bottleneck in the ionic conduction path between the two half-cells that would explain a jump to megohm resistance. Any change in effective membrane impedance is minor compared to the drastic effect of a blocked junction.\n\nE. The temperature dependence of ionic conductivity can be approximated for small temperature changes by either an Arrhenius form $\\kappa(T)\\propto \\exp(-E_{a}/(k_{B}T))$ or a linearized empirical form $\\kappa(T)\\approx \\kappa(T_{0})[1+\\alpha(T-T_{0})]$ with $\\alpha$ of order $10^{-2}$ per kelvin. A change of about $10$ kelvin reduces $\\kappa$ by at most a modest factor, so\n$$\n\\frac{R(15)}{R(25)}\\approx \\frac{\\kappa(25)}{\\kappa(15)}\n$$\nis on the order of unity, not $10^{3}$. Temperature cannot explain megohm readings.\n\nTherefore, the only option that plausibly and specifically explains the anomalously high resistance is a blocked or dried porous ceramic frit, which greatly increases the junction resistance and can readily yield megohm-scale values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1467677"}, {"introduction": "Building on the diagnostic challenge of a high-resistance electrode, this final exercise quantifies the resulting measurement error.
