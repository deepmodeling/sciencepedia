The electrode's response is primarily to the principal ion, $Cu^{2+}$, but other ions present in the sample can interfere with the measurement. The degree of interference from a specific ion is quantified by the selectivity coefficient, $k_{\\text{primary ion, interfering ion}}$. A larger value for the selectivity coefficient indicates a stronger response by the electrode to the interfering ion, implying more significant interference.\n\nThe chemist tests the new $Cu^{2+}$ ISE against three potential interfering ions known to be present in the effluent: zinc(II) ($Zn^{2+}$), nickel(II) ($Ni^{2+}$), and iron(III) ($Fe^{3+}$). The experimentally determined selectivity coefficients are as follows:\n- For zinc(II) interference, $k_{Cu^{2+},Zn^{2+}} = 1 \\times 10^{-2}$\n- For nickel(II) interference, $k_{Cu^{2+},Ni^{2+}} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- For iron(III) interference, $k_{Cu^{2+},Fe^{3+}} = 1 \\times 10^{-1}$\n\nBased on these values, which of the following options correctly ranks the interfering ions from the one causing the most interference to the one causing the least interference?\n\nA. $Ni^{2+} > Zn^{2+} > Fe^{3+}$\n\nB. $Fe^{3+} > Ni^{2+} > Zn^{2+}$\n\nC. $Fe^{3+} > Zn^{2+} > Ni^{2+}$\n\nD. $Zn^{2+} > Fe^{3+} > Ni^{2+}$", "solution": "We use the Nicolsky–Eisenman equation for an ion-selective electrode responding to a primary ion $i$ in the presence of interfering ions $j$:\n$$\nE=E^{0}+\\frac{RT}{z_{i}F}\\ln\\!\\left(a_{i}+\\sum_{j}k_{i,j}\\,a_{j}^{z_{i}/z_{j}}\\right).\n$$\nHere, for a $Cu^{2+}$ ISE, $z_{i}=2$ and the interfering ions are $Zn^{2+}$, $Ni^{2+}$, and $Fe^{3+}$. According to the problem statement, the degree of interference from a specific ion is quantified by the selectivity coefficient $k_{i,j}$, and a larger $k_{i,j}$ indicates a stronger response to the interfering ion, hence greater interference.\n\nTherefore, to rank the interferents by their interference, we compare the given selectivity coefficients directly:\n$$\nk_{Cu^{2+},Fe^{3+}}=1\\times 10^{-1},\\quad\nk_{Cu^{2+},Zn^{2+}}=1\\times 10^{-2},\\quad\nk_{Cu^{2+},Ni^{2+}}=1\\times 10^{-3}.\n$$\nSince $1\\times 10^{-1}>1\\times 10^{-2}>1\\times 10^{-3}$, the order from most to least interfering is\n$$\nFe^{3+} > Zn^{2+} > Ni^{2+},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1470758"}, {"introduction": "Now that you understand what a selectivity coefficient represents, the next logical step is to learn how it is determined experimentally.
