The electrode is performing ideally according to the Nernstian response for a divalent cation. This is incorrect. The ideal response is a slope of ~29.6 mV/decade, not 20.0 mV/decade.\nB. The electrode is exhibiting a super-Nernstian response. This is incorrect. A super-Nernstian response would mean the slope is greater than the theoretical value (e.g.,  29.6 mV/decade).\nC. The electrode is exhibiting a sub-Nernstian response, suggesting it is not operating at its theoretical optimum. This is correct. The measured slope of 20.0 mV/decade is less than the theoretical 29.6 mV/decade.\nD. The measured slope is incorrect, as the theoretical slope for any ion at this temperature is approximately 59.2 mV/decade. This is incorrect. A slope of ~59.2 mV/decade is the Nernstian response for a *monovalent* ion ($z=1$), not for any ion. The slope is dependent on the charge $z$.\nE. The electrode is likely designed for a monovalent cation, such as $Na^+$, and has been mistakenly used for calcium. This is a poor conclusion. If it were designed for a monovalent cation, its ideal response would be ~59.2 mV/decade. A measured slope of 20.0 mV/decade would still be a sub-Nernstian response, and a very poor one at that. The most direct and certain conclusion is that its performance for the divalent ion being tested is sub-Nernstian.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the electrode has a sub-Nernstian response and is not operating optimally.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1437713"}, {"introduction": "Moving from static measurements to a dynamic process, potentiometric titrations use an electrode to monitor concentration changes throughout a chemical reaction.

The titration is monitored using a copper ion-selective electrode (ISE) paired with a reference electrode. The potential of the ISE is related to the activity of free copper(II) ions.

The copper ISE potential follows the Nernst equation $E = E^{0} + \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln(a_{Cu^{2+}})$ with $z=2$, so decreasing $[Cu^{2+}]$ corresponds to increasing pCu. The titration reaction is\n$$Cu^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CuY^{2-},$$\nwith overall formation constant $K_{f} = \\frac{[CuY^{2-}]}{[Cu^{2+}][Y^{4-}] }$. At constant pH, EDTA speciation is constant, so one may use a conditional stability constant $K_{f}^{\\prime}$ defined by $K_{f}^{\\prime} = K_{f}\\alpha_{Y^{4-}}$, where $\\alpha_{Y^{4-}}$ is the fraction of total EDTA present as $Y^{4-}$ at the buffered pH. Thus,\n$$K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\frac{[CuY^{2-}]}{[Cu^{2+}][Y]_{\\text{eff}}},$$\nwhere $[Y]_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective concentration of complexing EDTA species.\n\nLet the initial sample volume be $V_{0}$ with total copper concentration $C_{M0}$, and the titrant EDTA concentration be $C_{L}$ with added volume $V$. The total volume is $V_{t} = V_{0}+V$. Define total concentrations after mixing:\n$$M_{T} = \\frac{C_{M0}V_{0}}{V_{t}}, \\quad L_{T} = \\frac{C_{L}V}{V_{t}}.$$\nMass balances and equilibrium relations give\n$$M_{T} = [Cu^{2+}] + [CuY^{2-}], \\quad L_{T} = [Y]_{\\text{eff}} + [CuY^{2-}],$$\nand\n$$K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\frac{[CuY^{2-}]}{[Cu^{2+}][Y]_{\\text{eff}}}.$$\nLet $x = [CuY^{2-}]$, $m = [Cu^{2+}]$, and $y = [Y]_{\\text{eff}}$.

The equivalence condition is $L_{T} = M_{T}$, which corresponds to $C_{L}V = C_{M0}V_{0}$ (a one-to-one stoichiometry). For $V  V_{\\text{eq}}$ (ligand limiting), $L_{T}  M_{T}$ and complexation is strong, so $x \\approx L_{T}$, $m \\approx M_{T}-L_{T}$, and $y \\approx 0$. As $V$ increases toward $V_{\\text{eq}}$, $m$ decreases markedly due to the large $K_{f}^{\\prime}$, causing pCu $= -\\log_{10}(m)$ to increase, with the change becoming steep near equivalence because small additions of EDTA heavily suppress $m$.\n\nAt $V \\approx V_{\\text{eq}}$, the denominator $(M_{T}-x)(L_{T}-x)$ in $K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\frac{x}{(M_{T}-x)(L_{T}-x)}$ becomes very small, so $m$ drops sharply and pCu rises sharply; this produces the steepest slope around equivalence.\n\nFor $V > V_{\\text{eq}}$ (ligand in excess), $L_{T} > M_{T}$ and $x \\approx M_{T}$, $m \\approx \\frac{x}{K_{f}^{\\prime} y} \\approx \\frac{M_{T}}{K_{f}^{\\prime}(L_{T}-M_{T})}$, which is very small and decreases further as $V$ increases (since $L_{T}-M_{T}$ increases). Consequently pCu is high and increases more slowly with further addition due to dilution and the equilibrium expression, giving a flattened high-pCu tail.\n\nTherefore, as EDTA is added, $[Cu^{2+}]$ decreases, so pCu increases, with a steep rise near the equivalence point and flatter regions before and after—an increasing sigmoidal curve with the steepest increase at equivalence. This matches option A and contradicts the alternatives: B would require $[Cu^{2+}]$ to increase with EDTA (incorrect), C ignores equilibrium nonlinearity, and D/E predict extrema at equivalence inconsistent with strong complexation behavior for pCu.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1437696"}, {"introduction": "This final practice problem highlights the distinct strengths of direct potentiometry versus potentiometric titration by presenting a compelling analytical puzzle.
