The standard procedure involves adding a sufficient amount of a soluble sulfate salt to precipitate all the strontium as strontium sulfate ($SrSO_4$). The precipitate is then filtered, dried, and weighed.\n\nHowever, the chemist is aware that the wastewater might also contain a significant concentration of barium ions ($Ba^{2+}$). Due to their similar ionic radii and charge, $Ba^{2+}$ ions can be incorporated into the strontium sulfate crystal lattice during precipitation, substituting for $Sr^{2+}$ ions. This type of coprecipitation is known as inclusion.\n\nLet the molar mass of a strontium atom be $MM_{Sr}$ and the molar mass of a barium atom be $MM_{Ba}$. It is given that $MM_{Ba} > MM_{Sr}$. The chemist, following the standard protocol, weighs the final dried precipitate and assumes it is 100% pure $SrSO_4$ for the subsequent calculations to determine the mass of strontium in the original sample.\n\nHow does the presence of this barium coprecipitation affect the final calculated result for the mass of strontium?\n\nA.

The calculated mass of strontium will be unaffected because the 1:1 molar substitution of cations does not change the total moles of precipitate.\n\nD. The effect cannot be determined without knowing the molar mass of the sulfate group ($SO_{4}^{2-}$).", "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding how the mass of the precipitate and the subsequent calculations are affected by the substitution of the analyte ion ($Sr^{2+}$) with a contaminant ion ($Ba^{2+}$).\n\n**Step 1: Define the Gravimetric Calculation**\nIn a standard gravimetric analysis, the mass of the analyte is determined from the mass of the precipitate using a gravimetric factor (GF). The formula is:\n$$m_{\\text{analyte}} = m_{\\text{precipitate}} \\times \\text{GF}$$\nIn this case, the analyte is strontium ($Sr$) and the precipitate is assumed to be strontium sulfate ($SrSO_4$). The gravimetric factor is the ratio of the molar mass of the analyte to the molar mass of the precipitate.\n$$\\text{GF} = \\frac{MM_{Sr}}{MM_{SrSO_4}}$$\nThe chemist measures the mass of the precipitate, $m_{\\text{precipitate, measured}}$, and calculates the mass of strontium as:\n$$m_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} = m_{\\text{precipitate, measured}} \\times \\frac{MM_{Sr}}{MM_{SrSO_4}}$$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Effect of Contamination on the Precipitate Mass**\nThe contamination process involves a substitution (inclusion) where one $Ba^{2+}$ ion replaces one $Sr^{2+}$ ion in the crystal lattice. Let's consider a scenario where $n$ moles of $Sr^{2+}$ ions are replaced by $n$ moles of $Ba^{2+}$ ions.\nThe true amount of strontium precipitated is less than what would have been precipitated without contamination. Let's say the total moles of cation sites in the final crystal is $N_{total}$. Then the moles of actual $SrSO_4$ formed are $(N_{total} - n)$ and the moles of contaminant $BaSO_4$ formed are $n$.\n\nThe total mass of the precipitate measured by the chemist is the sum of the masses of the two components:\n$$m_{\\text{precipitate, measured}} = (N_{total} - n) \\times MM_{SrSO_4} + n \\times MM_{BaSO_4}$$\n\nWe are given that $MM_{Ba} > MM_{Sr}$. The molar mass of the sulfate group, $MM_{SO_4}$, is constant.\nTherefore, the molar mass of barium sulfate, $MM_{BaSO_4} = MM_{Ba} + MM_{SO_4}$, is greater than the molar mass of strontium sulfate, $MM_{SrSO_4} = MM_{Sr} + MM_{SO_4}$.\nFor every mole of strontium replaced by barium, the mass of the precipitate increases by $(MM_{BaSO_4} - MM_{SrSO_4})$. Since $MM_{BaSO_4} > MM_{SrSO_4}$, this change is positive.\nThus, the measured mass of the contaminated precipitate is greater than the mass of a pure precipitate that would contain the *true* amount of strontium.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Error in the Final Calculation**\nThe chemist uses the artificially high measured mass, $m_{\\text{precipitate, measured}}$, in their calculation, while incorrectly assuming the entire mass is pure $SrSO_4$. Let's determine the number of moles the chemist *thinks* they have.\n$$n_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{precipitate, measured}}}{MM_{SrSO_4}} = \\frac{(N_{total} - n) \\times MM_{SrSO_4} + n \\times MM_{BaSO_4}}{MM_{SrSO_4}}$$\n$$n_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} = (N_{total} - n) + n \\left( \\frac{MM_{BaSO_4}}{MM_{SrSO_4}} \\right)$$\nThe *true* number of moles of strontium in the precipitate is $n_{Sr, \\text{true}} = (N_{total} - n)$.\n\nTo see if the calculated result is high or low, we compare $n_{Sr, \\text{calculated}}$ with $n_{Sr, \\text{true}}$. The difference is:\n$$\\text{Error in moles} = n_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} - n_{Sr, \\text{true}} = n \\left( \\frac{MM_{BaSO_4}}{MM_{SrSO_4}} \\right) - n = n \\left( \\frac{MM_{BaSO_4}}{MM_{SrSO_4}} - 1 \\right)$$\nSince we established that $MM_{BaSO_4} > MM_{SrSO_4}$, the ratio $\\frac{MM_{BaSO_4}}{MM_{SrSO_4}} > 1$.\nConsequently, the term $\\left( \\frac{MM_{BaSO_4}}{MM_{SrSO_4}} - 1 \\right)$ is positive. As $n > 0$ for any contamination, the error is positive.\nThis means $n_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} > n_{Sr, \\text{true}}$.\n\nSince the calculated mass of strontium is directly proportional to the calculated moles of strontium ($m_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} = n_{Sr, \\text{calculated}} \\times MM_{Sr}$), a higher calculated number of moles leads to a higher calculated mass.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe coprecipitation of barium, an ion with a higher molar mass than strontium, results in a precipitate that is heavier than it should be for the actual amount of strontium present. When the analyst uses this inflated precipitate mass in the standard calculation (which assumes the precipitate is pure, lighter $SrSO_4$), they overestimate the number of moles of strontium, leading to a final calculated mass of strontium that is artificially high.\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer. Option D is incorrect because the conclusion only depends on the relative molar masses of $Ba$ and $Sr$, which directly translates to the relative molar masses of $BaSO_4$ and $SrSO_4$, regardless of the specific value of $MM_{SO_4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1435842"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the conceptual understanding of precipitation errors, this exercise transitions to practical, quantitative correction.

The method involves precipitating barium as barium sulfate ($BaSO_4$) by adding a solution of sodium sulfate ($Na_2SO_4$). Two separate series of experiments, Series A and Series B, are conducted.\n\nIn Series A, the initial solution contains a known concentration of $Ba^{2+}$ and a large, synthesized organic dye molecule, `ChromoFluor-P`, as the impurity. In Series B, the initial solution contains the same concentration of $Ba^{2+}$ but with ferric ions ($Fe^{3+}$) as the impurity.\n\nFor both series, the precipitation is carried out by adding the $Na_2SO_4$ solution at three different rates: slow, moderate, and fast. After precipitation, the impurity concentration in the solid $BaSO_4$ is measured and reported as \"initial contamination\" (in micrograms of impurity per gram of $BaSO_4$). Subsequently, each precipitate undergoes a standardized purification treatment: it is heated and stirred in its mother liquor for one hour (a process known as digestion) and then thoroughly washed with a dilute acid solution. After this treatment, the impurity concentration is measured again and reported as \"final contamination\". The experimental observations are summarized below.\n\n**Observations for Series A (ChromoFluor-P impurity):**\nThe initial contamination was found to be strongly dependent on the rate of precipitation; the sample formed by fast addition of the precipitant showed approximately ten times more contamination than the sample from the slow addition. However, after the digestion and washing treatment, the final contamination for all three samples (slow, moderate, and fast) was reduced to a nearly identical, negligible level, close to the detection limit of the measurement technique.\n\n**Observations for Series B ($Fe^{3+}$ impurity):**\nThe initial contamination also increased as the rate of precipitation increased. The sample from fast addition had significantly more contamination than the one from slow addition. After the digestion and washing treatment, the contamination level in all samples was reduced, but only by about 20-30% of the initial amount.

Faster precipitation produces more, smaller particles with larger total surface area, increasing initial adsorption. Digestion (Ostwald ripening) causes crystal growth and surface rearrangement, reducing surface area and allowing desorption; thorough washing removes the loosely held species, so final contamination becomes low and largely independent of the initial precipitation rate.\n- Occlusion: impurity species become mechanically trapped within growing crystals during rapid growth. This effect increases with faster precipitation but is not effectively removed by washing, and digestion only partially reduces it unless significant recrystallization occurs; thus a positive correlation with precipitation rate persists in the final contamination.\n- Inclusion: impurity replaces a lattice ion due to similar size and charge; this is largely permanent and depends on ionic match, not primarily on precipitation rate.\n- Post-precipitation: a separate, slow-forming impurity phase deposits onto the primary precipitate during standing or digestion, often increasing with longer digestion times.\n\nApply these to the observations:\n1) Series A with the large organic dye ChromoFluor-P shows strong rate dependence in initial contamination: fast addition gives much higher contamination than slow addition. After digestion and washing, the final contamination for all rates is nearly identical and near the detection limit. A large organic molecule is unlikely to substitute into or be included within the $BaSO_4$ crystal lattice due to size and charge mismatch, and post-precipitation would not be eliminated by digestion and washing to a negligible, rate-independent level. The pattern—strong initial rate dependence followed by near-complete removal and loss of rate dependence after digestion—matches surface adsorption.\n2) Series B with $Fe^{3+}$ shows initial contamination increasing with precipitation rate, and after digestion and washing, only a modest reduction (about 0.2 to 0.3 of the initial amount) occurs; importantly, the strong positive correlation with precipitation rate remains. This persistence after digestion and washing indicates the impurity is not merely surface-adsorbed. Inclusion is unlikely because $Fe^{3+}$ does not match the $Ba^{2+}$ lattice site in $BaSO_4$ in charge, and post-precipitation typically would not be reduced by digestion. The observations are characteristic of occlusion, where $Fe^{3+}$-bearing species become trapped within the growing $BaSO_4$ crystals during rapid precipitation and are not readily removed by digestion or washing.\n\nTherefore, the dominant mechanisms are surface adsorption for Series A and occlusion for Series B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1435857"}]}
