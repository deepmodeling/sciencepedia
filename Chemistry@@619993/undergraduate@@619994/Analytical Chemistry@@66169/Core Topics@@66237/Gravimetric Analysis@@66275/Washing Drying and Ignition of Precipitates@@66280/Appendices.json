The precipitate is then collected on a piece of ashless filter paper.\n\nThe next step is the ignition of the precipitate and filter paper in a crucible. A critical error occurs at this stage: the student heats the crucible too rapidly in the presence of limited air. This improper technique fails to completely combust the filter paper, leaving a visible residue of black carbon mixed with the final white precipitate.

The calculation is based on the mass of the precipitate, which is assumed to be pure barium sulfate ($\\text{BaSO}_4$).

Let's analyze the two sources of error described.\n\n**Error 1: Inclusion of residual carbon.**\nThe incomplete combustion of the filter paper leaves unreacted carbon ($\\text{C}$) in the crucible. This carbon has mass and is weighed along with the precipitate. This effect, considered in isolation, would make the weighed mass greater than the ideal mass of pure $\\text{BaSO}_4$. This would lead to a calculated mass of sulfate that is erroneously high.\n\n**Error 2: Chemical reduction of $\\text{BaSO}_4$ to $\\text{BaS}$.**\nThe reaction $\\text{BaSO}_4(s) + 4\\text{C}(s) \\rightarrow \\text{BaS}(s) + 4\\text{CO}(g)$ consumes some of the intended precipitate ($\\text{BaSO}_4$) and converts it into a different compound, barium sulfide ($\\text{BaS}$). To determine the effect of this conversion on the mass, we must compare the molar masses of the reactant and product solids.\n- Molar Mass of $\\text{BaSO}_4$: $M_{BaSO_4} \\approx 137.33 + 32.07 + 4(16.00) = 233.40 \\text{ g/mol}$\n- Molar Mass of $\\text{BaS}$: $M_{BaS} \\approx 137.33 + 32.07 = 169.40 \\text{ g/mol}$\n\nFor every mole of $\\text{BaSO}_4$ that is converted to $\\text{BaS}$, the mass of the solid precipitate decreases by $233.40 \\text{ g} - 169.40 \\text{ g} = 64.00 \\text{ g}$. This chemical reaction therefore leads to a significant loss of mass. This effect, considered in isolation, would make the weighed mass lower than the ideal mass of pure $\\text{BaSO}_4$, leading to a calculated mass of sulfate that is erroneously low.\n\n**Net Effect:**\nWe must compare the magnitude of the two opposing effects. Let's analyze the stoichiometry of the reduction reaction. To achieve the mass loss of $64.00$ g by converting one mole of $\\text{BaSO}_4$, four moles of carbon are *consumed*. The mass of four moles of carbon is $4 \\times 12.01 \\text{ g/mol} = 48.04 \\text{ g}$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the net effect for a given amount of carbon from the filter paper. A portion of the carbon, let's call it $C_{reacted}$, reacts with $\\text{BaSO}_4$, causing a mass loss. The remaining portion, $C_{residual}$, is simply mixed in, causing a mass gain.\n- The mass change from the reaction is a loss. For every gram of carbon that reacts, the mass of the precipitate decreases by $\\frac{64.00 \\text{ g}}{48.04 \\text{ g}} \\approx 1.33$ g.\n- The mass change from residual carbon is a gain. For every gram of carbon that remains unreacted, the mass of the precipitate increases by 1 g.\n\nSince the mass loss per gram of carbon involved in the reaction (a factor of 1.33) is greater than the mass gain per gram of residual carbon (a factor of 1), the reduction effect is more potent than the inclusion effect for a given amount of carbon. In practice, the reduction of sulfate is a well-known and significant error in this gravimetric procedure, and analytical chemistry protocols are designed specifically to prevent it. When it does occur, it typically leads to a substantial decrease in the final mass. Therefore, the net effect is a final weighed mass that is lower than the ideal mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the final weighed mass is erroneously low, the calculated mass of sulfate will also be erroneously low. Consequently, the final calculated mass percentage of sulfate in the original sample will be erroneously low.\n\nLet's examine the options:\nA. Incorrect. This would only happen if the carbon inclusion were the only error.\nB. Correct. The mass loss from chemical reduction is the dominant effect.\nC. Incorrect. There is no chemical or physical reason for the two effects to cancel perfectly.\nD. Incorrect. The gravimetric factor is based on the molar mass of $\\text{BaSO}_4$. Using the mass of a mixture containing $\\text{BaS}$ with the GF for $\\text{BaSO}_4$ is the source of the error. The GFs for the two compounds would be different.\nE. Incorrect.

After placing a hot crucible on the balance, two thermal effects arise:\n\n1) The air immediately surrounding the hot crucible is warmed, reducing its density to $\\rho_{\\text{hot}}<\\rho_{\\text{amb}}$.

This force is directed upward and reduces the net downward force sensed by the balance, making $m_{\\text{meas}}$ smaller than $m$.\n\nThe measured mass, relative to the ambient, quiescent condition, is shifted by the competition of these two effects:\n$$\nm_{\\text{meas}} g \\approx mg - \\big(F_{\\text{b,hot}}+F_{\\text{d}}\\big) \\quad\\text{versus}\\quad mg - F_{\\text{b,amb}}.\n$$\nSubtracting the ambient expression from the hot-object expression gives the change in indicated force,\n$$\n\\Delta (m_{\\text{meas}} g) \\approx -F_{\\text{d}} + \\Delta F_{\\text{b}},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{meas}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta F_{\\text{b}} - F_{\\text{d}}}{g}.\n$$\nThus the indication decreases (appears too low) if $F_{\\text{d}}>\\Delta F_{\\text{b}}$.
