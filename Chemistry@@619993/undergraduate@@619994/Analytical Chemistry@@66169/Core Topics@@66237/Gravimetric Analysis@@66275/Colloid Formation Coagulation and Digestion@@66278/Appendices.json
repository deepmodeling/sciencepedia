The resulting iron(III) hydroxide, $\\text{Fe(OH)}_3$, is known to have an extremely low solubility in water.\n\nThe goal is to understand the initial state of the material formed immediately after mixing. Based on the fundamental principles governing precipitation from solution, which of the following statements best describes the nature of the precipitate formed under these specific experimental conditions?\n\nA. A crystalline precipitate is formed, because the rapid mixing provides the activation energy necessary for ions to arrange into an ordered crystal lattice.\n\nB. A gelatinous precipitate is formed, because the high initial reactant concentrations lead to a state of high relative supersaturation, which overwhelmingly favors rapid nucleation over crystal growth.\n\nC. A crystalline precipitate is formed, because the very low solubility of iron(III) hydroxide means that any solid formed will be highly stable and thus must be crystalline.\n\nD. A gelatinous precipitate is formed, because the presence of spectator ions ($\\text{Na}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$) physically interferes with and inhibits the formation of a regular crystal structure.\n\nE. An equal mixture of crystalline and gelatinous material is formed, because the high concentration and rapid mixing cause the rates of nucleation and crystal growth to become comparable.", "solution": "The precipitation reaction is the formation of the sparingly soluble solid from its ions:\n$$\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}(aq) + 3\\,OH^{-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Fe(OH)_{3}(s)}.$$\nThe solubility product is defined in terms of activities as\n$$K_{\\mathrm{sp}}=a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}\\,a_{\\mathrm{OH^{-}}}^{3}.$$\nImmediately after rapidly mixing equal volumes of highly concentrated solutions of $\\mathrm{FeCl_{3}}$ and $\\mathrm{NaOH}$, the ion activity product\n$$Q=a_{\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}}\\,a_{\\mathrm{OH^{-}}}^{3}$$\nis large, and because $Fe(OH)_{3}$ is extremely insoluble, the relative supersaturation\n$$S=\\frac{Q}{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}}$$\nsatisfies $S \\gg 1$.\n\nClassical nucleation theory relates the reversible work to form a cluster of radius $r$ to a competition between surface and volume terms:\n$$\\Delta G(r)=4\\pi r^{2}\\gamma-\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3}\\Delta g_{v},$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the interfacial free energy and $\\Delta g_{v}$ is the bulk free energy change per unit volume driving precipitation.

Under the stated conditions (rapid mixing, high initial reactant concentrations), $S$ is very large, so nucleation is overwhelmingly favored over crystal growth. This produces a very high number density of nuclei with very small $r^{*}$, causing the solute to be partitioned among many subcritical-to-critical clusters. Growth is then limited by diffusion and surface rearrangement, so the initially formed solid lacks long-range order and is highly hydrated and polymeric, resulting in an amorphous, gelatinous precipitate characteristic of metal hydroxides like $Fe(OH)_{3}$ at high supersaturation. Aging and Ostwald ripening may later transform this gel into more crystalline phases, but the immediate product is gelatinous.\n\nThese principles also diagnose the incorrect options:\n- A is incorrect because vigorous mixing does not supply thermal activation energy to order ions; the key control is the supersaturation lowering $\\Delta G^{*}$, which favors nucleation, not direct lattice ordering.\n- C is incorrect because low $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ increases the thermodynamic driving force to precipitate but does not guarantee crystallinity; kinetics at high supersaturation yield amorphous gels initially.\n- D is incorrect because spectator ions primarily affect activity coefficients and double-layer interactions; they do not fundamentally prevent crystallization, and their presence does not outweigh the dominant effect of high supersaturation on nucleation.\n- E is incorrect because at very high supersaturation nucleation rates far exceed growth rates; there is no basis for an equal mixture, and the initial state is nucleation-dominated and gelatinous.\n\nTherefore, the best description is that a gelatinous precipitate forms due to high relative supersaturation that favors rapid nucleation over crystal growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1431062"}, {"introduction": "Once a colloid has been coagulated, its stability is not set in stone; it remains sensitive to its environment. This exercise examines what happens when a coagulated precipitate is washed to remove impurities [@problem_id:1431024]. You will investigate the phenomenon of peptization, where the removal of an electrolyte causes the precipitate to re-disperse into a stable colloid. This practice highlights the vital role of ionic strength in screening surface charges and provides a practical lesson on why precipitates can be lost during washing if the wrong solvent is used.", "problem": "In a gravimetric analysis experiment, a student synthesizes a hydrous ferric oxide precipitate, $\\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3 \\cdot x\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, by slowly adding a dilute solution of aqueous ammonia, $\\text{NH}_3$, to a heated solution of ferric chloride, $\\text{FeCl}_3$, until the ammonia is in slight excess. The resulting gelatinous, reddish-brown precipitate is held at an elevated temperature for a short period to promote the formation of larger aggregates, a process known as digestion. The bulk of the supernatant liquid, which contains the soluble byproduct ammonium chloride ($\\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}$), is then carefully decanted. To purify the precipitate, the student begins a washing process. This involves repeatedly adding a large volume of pure deionized water, stirring the mixture, allowing the solid to settle, and decanting the wash water. After several such washing cycles, the student observes a distinct change in the physical state of the precipitate.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the observed phenomenon and its underlying scientific principle?\n\nA. The precipitate begins to re-disperse into the deionized water, forming a stable reddish-brown colloidal suspension. This process, known as peptization, occurs because the washing removes the high concentration of electrolyte ($\\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}$) that was shielding the electrostatic repulsion between the primary particles of the precipitate.\n\nB. The precipitate dissolves to form a clear, colorless solution. This happens because the hydrous ferric oxide, being amphoteric, reacts with the pure water (acting as a very weak acid) to form a soluble iron(III) aquo complex.\n\nC. The precipitate particles become visibly smaller due to the mechanical agitation of stirring but continue to settle out of solution rapidly after each wash. The overall mass of the precipitate decreases as smaller particles are inadvertently decanted.\n\nD. The precipitate becomes more compact and crystalline with each wash. The removal of the ammonium chloride impurity allows the primary particles to pack more efficiently, leading to faster settling and a denser solid mass.\n\nE. The precipitate particles swell and change color from reddish-brown to a brighter yellow-orange as they become more hydrated by the deionized water, but they remain a settled, non-dispersed solid at the bottom of the container.", "solution": "The formation and behavior of the hydrous ferric oxide precipitate are governed by colloid chemistry and electrolyte effects. The precipitation reaction can be represented schematically as the formation of a hydrated ferric oxide (often written as $\\text{Fe}( \\text{OH} )_{3}$ or $\\text{Fe}_{2}\\text{O}_{3} \\cdot x \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$) in the presence of excess ammonia, producing ammonium chloride in solution:\n$$\n\\text{FeCl}_{3} + 3\\,\\text{NH}_{3} + 3\\,\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\longrightarrow \\text{Fe}( \\text{OH} )_{3}\\,(\\text{s, colloidal}) + 3\\,\\text{NH}_{4}\\text{Cl}\\,(\\text{aq}).\n$$\nThe freshly formed hydrous ferric oxide is a gelatinous colloid whose primary particles carry surface charge and are surrounded by a diffuse ionic atmosphere (electrical double layer). In the presence of the electrolyte $\\text{NH}_{4}\\text{Cl}$, the ionic strength $I$ is elevated. The ionic strength is defined by\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^{2},\n$$\nwhere $c_{i}$ and $z_{i}$ are the molar concentration and charge number of ion $i$, respectively. An increased $I$ compresses the electrical double layer according to Debye-Huckel theory. For a symmetric electrolyte, the Debye parameter $\\kappa$ satisfies\n$$\n\\kappa^{2} = \\frac{2 e^{2} N_{A}}{\\varepsilon k_{B} T}\\, I,\n$$\nso that the Debye length is $\\kappa^{-1} \\propto I^{-1/2}$. A high $I$ therefore yields a small $\\kappa^{-1}$, thinning the double layer and screening the electrostatic repulsion between like-charged particles. This facilitates coagulation during digestion, allowing aggregates to grow and settle.\n\nWhen the precipitate is washed repeatedly with deionized water, $I$ in the supernatant decreases substantially as $\\text{NH}_{4}\\text{Cl}$ is removed. As $I \\downarrow$, one has $\\kappa \\downarrow$ and hence $\\kappa^{-1} \\uparrow$, thickening the double layer. The electrostatic repulsive interaction between particles increases in range and magnitude; a common DLVO representation of the interparticle potential is\n$$\nV(h) = V_{\\text{vdW}}(h) + V_{\\text{el}}(h),\n$$\nwith $V_{\\text{el}}(h)$ typically decaying as $\\exp(-\\kappa h)$ and $V_{\\text{vdW}}(h)$ attractive. Decreasing $I$ increases the repulsive barrier height relative to thermal energy $k_{B} T$, so that Brownian encounters are no longer able to overcome the barrier. The aggregates then break up into smaller units or primary particles and form a stable colloidal dispersion. This redispersion of a coagulated precipitate upon removal of electrolyte is called peptization. In this system, the colloid exhibits the characteristic reddish-brown color of hydrous ferric oxide and remains stably dispersed rather than settling rapidly.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that washing out $\\text{NH}_{4}\\text{Cl}$ removes charge screening, increases double-layer thickness, and restores electrostatic stabilization, producing a stable colloidal suspension (peptization), as stated in option A.\n\nThe other options are inconsistent with the principles above:\n- Option B is incorrect because hydrous ferric oxide does not dissolve in pure water; amphoterism refers to dissolution in strong acid or strong base via protonation or formation of hydroxo complexes, not in neutral water. A clear, colorless solution is not expected.\n- Option C misattributes the behavior to mechanical comminution; the central effect is electrostatic stabilization leading to redispersion, not merely smaller yet still rapidly settling particles.\n- Option D describes further coagulation and crystallization, which is promoted by electrolyte and digestion, not by its removal via washing; reducing $I$ opposes coagulation by increasing repulsion.\n- Option E asserts swelling and a color change without dispersion; the characteristic phenomenon upon electrolyte removal is peptization and stable dispersion, not mere swelling with a color shift.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1431024"}, {"introduction": "Beyond passively controlling ionic strength, we can actively manipulate colloidal stability using specific ions, a cornerstone of many industrial processes.

The zeta potential will monotonically approach zero from its initial negative value. The sol will coagulate and flocculate, and will not restabilize at any concentration of the added salt.\n\nB.

The net surface charge density becomes\n$$\n\\sigma=\\sigma_{0}+\\sigma_{S}.\n$$\nAs the concentration of aluminum increases, $\\sigma$ increases from negative values toward zero, and the zeta potential $\\zeta$ correspondingly becomes less negative, approaching zero. At the isoelectric point where $\\sigma=0$, the zeta potential satisfies $\\zeta\\approx 0$, the electrostatic repulsion vanishes, and the DLVO energy barrier collapses; this condition promotes rapid coagulation and flocculation.\n\nWith further addition of aluminum, specific adsorption overcompensates the initial negative charge, so that $\\sigma>0$ and the surface potential changes sign. Consequently, the zeta potential becomes positive, $\\zeta>0$, indicating charge reversal (overcharging). In this regime, like-charged particles again experience electrostatic repulsion with amplitude scaling as $\\zeta^{2}$, and the dispersion can restabilize as a positively charged colloid, provided that the ionic strength has not suppressed the repulsive barrier to the extent that coagulation persists.
