The KF titration is based on the reaction of iodine with water in the presence of sulfur dioxide and a base (e.g., imidazole) in a non-aqueous solvent like methanol. The titration cell is first \"pre-titrated\" by electrochemically generating iodine until all residual moisture in the solvent is consumed, at which point a stable endpoint is reached, indicated by the presence of a slight excess of iodine, giving the solution a characteristic pale brown color.\n\nThe chemist then injects a precisely measured volume of the organic sample into the conditioned titration cell.

The platinum double-pin indicator electrode is dirty or has become disconnected.\n\nD. The Karl Fischer reagent has been contaminated with a strong reducing agent other than water.\n\nE. An excessively acidic sample was introduced into the unbuffered KF solvent system.", "solution": "Fundamental principle: In a coulometric Karl Fischer (KF) titration, iodine is generated electrochemically and reacts stoichiometrically with water in the presence of sulfur dioxide and a base in an alcohol solvent. A representative overall reaction sequence is:\n$$\\text{I}_2 + \\text{SO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 3B \\rightarrow 2BH^+\\text{I}^- + B\\text{SO}_3^-$$\nfollowed by trapping of the sulfite in alcohol:\n$$B\\text{SO}_3^- + ROH \\rightarrow BH^+RO\\text{SO}_3^-$$\nThus, each mole of water consumes one mole of $\\text{I}_2$. The KF endpoint corresponds to a slight, persistent excess of $\\text{I}_2$ (pale brown color), detected electrically by the indicator electrode and visually by color.\n\nExpected behavior on sample addition: If the injected sample contains water, the freshly generated $\\text{I}_2$ is immediately consumed, the brown color disappears, and only after all water is titrated does a persistent excess of $\\text{I}_2$ reappear, restoring the endpoint.\n\nObserved behavior: The pale brown endpoint color remains persistent and stable almost immediately after sample addition. This indicates that essentially no $\\text{I}_2$ is being consumed by water upon injection, i.e., the instantaneous consumption term is negligible.\n\nOption analysis:\n- A (very high water): This would increase iodine consumption, causing the color to disappear for a prolonged period until sufficient $\\text{I}_2$ is generated. This contradicts the observed immediate persistence of the brown color. Reject A.\n- B (essentially anhydrous sample): With negligible water, the consumption of $\\text{I}_2$ is negligible, so the endpoint color persists immediately upon addition. This directly matches the observation. Accept B.\n- C (dirty/disconnected indicator electrode): While this can disrupt electrical endpoint control, it does not prevent the chemical reaction between $\\text{I}_2$ and water. If water were present, $\\text{I}_2$ would still be consumed and the brown color would transiently disappear regardless of the electrode status. The observation of persistent color is therefore not best explained by C. Reject C.\n- D (reagent contaminated with a strong reducing agent): A reducing contaminant would consume $\\text{I}_2$, preventing attainment of a stable endpoint during pre-titration and leading to loss of the brown color, not its persistence. This contradicts the successful initial conditioning and the observed persistence. Reject D.\n- E (excessively acidic sample into an unbuffered system): Strong acidity can suppress the KF reaction by neutralizing the base, which could lead to persistent excess $\\text{I}_2$. However, the stem describes a standard KF system with base present, and the cell was successfully conditioned to endpoint, indicating proper buffering at the outset. Given the standard practice and the simplicity of the observation, this is less likely than a truly anhydrous sample. Reject E as less likely.\n\nConclusion: The most likely cause of persistent endpoint color immediately after sample addition is that the sample contains negligible water.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1452839"}]}
