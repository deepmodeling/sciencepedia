[@problem_id:1450764]", "problem": "An analytical chemistry student is tasked with determining the precise concentration of an aqueous potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) solution via iodometric titration. The procedure involves the following steps: An exact volume of the KMnO₄ solution is pipetted into an Erlenmeyer flask. Then, an excess of an acidified potassium iodide (KI) solution is added. This results in the rapid conversion of iodide (I⁻) to iodine (I₂) by the permanganate ion (MnO₄⁻), which itself is reduced to the manganese(II) ion (Mn²⁺). Finally, the liberated iodine is titrated with a standardized sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) solution to a starch endpoint.\n\nDuring one trial, after adding the acidified KI solution, the student is interrupted and leaves the un-stoppered flask on a laboratory bench exposed to direct sunlight for approximately 30 minutes before proceeding with the titration.

Which of the following statements best describes the systematic error introduced by this delay and its effect on the calculated molarity of the KMnO₄ solution?\n\nA. The calculated concentration of KMnO₄ will be erroneously low. This is because sunlight provides energy for the liberated iodine (I₂) to sublime from the open flask, reducing the amount of iodine available for titration.\n\nB.

Any photochemical side reactions are negligible in this time frame and do not involve the primary reactants or products in a way that would alter the titration results.\n\nE.

However, excess iodide is present specifically to retain iodine in solution via\n$$\n\\mathrm{I_{2} + I^{-} \\rightleftharpoons I_{3}^{-}},\n$$\nfor which the equilibrium constant is large, greatly suppressing iodine volatility. Consequently, iodine loss to the atmosphere is minimized relative to the light-promoted oxidation of iodide by oxygen in acidic solution over the stated time.\n\nOther options are inconsistent with the chemistry. Sunlight does not alter the stoichiometric yield of the rapid permanganate-iodide reaction (so it cannot create more iodine than dictated by stoichiometry), and any unreacted $\\mathrm{MnO_{4}^{-}}$ would already have been consumed rapidly by the excess iodide under acidic conditions, rendering subsequent photodecomposition of permanganate irrelevant. Therefore, the dominant systematic effect of the delay in sunlight is the formation of extra iodine by oxidation of iodide by atmospheric oxygen, causing an erroneously high calculated $\\mathrm{KMnO_{4}}$ concentration.\n\nHence the best choice is that the calculated concentration is erroneously high because sunlight promotes oxidation of excess iodide by atmospheric oxygen, generating additional iodine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1450764"}]}
