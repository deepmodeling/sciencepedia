The separation is performed on a standard C18 packed column with a length $L = 15.0$ cm and an internal diameter $d = 4.6$ mm. The column packing has a total porosity $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}} = 0.65$. The analysis is run under isocratic conditions with a constant mobile phase flow rate of $F = 1.00$ mL/min.

The time difference between these two maxima is measured to be $\\Delta t_R = 0.20$ minutes.\n\nA common cause for this type of peak splitting is the formation of a void at the column inlet. This creates a \"fast track\" path for a portion of the injected analyte. We can model this situation by assuming that a fraction of the analyte molecules effectively bypasses the stationary phase over a length $L_{\\text{void}}$ at the inlet, while the remaining analyte interacts with the stationary phase over the full column length $L$. For both populations of molecules, assume the transit time through the mobile phase is determined by the total column volume and flow rate.

Express your answer in millimeters (mm), rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the length of a void, $L_{\\text{void}}$, that has formed at the inlet of an HPLC column, based on an observed splitting of a chromatographic peak. We are given a model to account for this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental relationship for retention time, $t_R$, in chromatography:\n$t_R = t_M (1+k)$\nwhere $t_M$ is the column dead time (the time it takes for an unretained species to pass through the column) and $k$ is the retention factor. The retention factor is defined as the ratio of time the analyte spends in the stationary phase ($t_S$) to the time it spends in the mobile phase ($t_M$), so $k = t_S/t_M$. This means $t_S = k \\cdot t_M$, and the total retention time can be written as the sum of time in the mobile phase and time in the stationary phase: $t_R = t_M + t_S = t_M + k \\cdot t_M$.\n\nAccording to the proposed model, the injected analyte splits into two populations giving two peaks.\n\nFor the \"normal\" population, the analyte interacts with the stationary phase along the entire column length $L$. Its retention time, $t_{R, \\text{normal}}$, is given by the standard equation:\n$t_{R, \\text{normal}} = t_M (1+k)$\n\nFor the \"fast track\" population, the analyte travels through the mobile phase for the entire column length, so its time in the mobile phase is still $t_M$. However, it only interacts with the stationary phase over an effective length of $(L - L_{\\text{void}})$. Since the time spent in the stationary phase, $t_S$, is proportional to the amount of stationary phase encountered, which is proportional to the packed length, the time in the stationary phase for this population, $t_{S, \\text{fast}}$, is reduced by a factor of $(L - L_{\\text{void}})/L$.\n$t_{S, \\text{fast}} = t_S \\cdot \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L} = (k \\cdot t_M) \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L}$\nThe retention time for the fast-track population, $t_{R, \\text{fast}}$, is the sum of its time in the mobile phase and its reduced time in the stationary phase:\n$t_{R, \\text{fast}} = t_M + t_{S, \\text{fast}} = t_M + k \\cdot t_M \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L} = t_M \\left(1 + k \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L}\\right)$\n\nThe observed time separation between the two peak maxima, $\\Delta t_R$, is the difference between these two retention times:\n$\\Delta t_R = t_{R, \\text{normal}} - t_{R, \\text{fast}}$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M(1+k) - t_M \\left(1 + k \\frac{L - L_{\\text{void}}}{L}\\right)$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M \\left[ (1+k) - \\left(1 + k\\left(1 - \\frac{L_{\\text{void}}}{L}\\right)\\right) \\right]$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M \\left[ 1+k - 1 - k + k\\frac{L_{\\text{void}}}{L} \\right]$\n$\\Delta t_R = t_M \\cdot k \\cdot \\frac{L_{\\text{void}}}{L}$\n\nWe need to solve for $L_{\\text{void}}$:\n$L_{\\text{void}} = \\frac{\\Delta t_R \\cdot L}{k \\cdot t_M}$\n\nTo use this equation, we first need to calculate the column dead time, $t_M$.
