The output, called a chromatogram, shows peaks corresponding to each separated component.\n\nThe chemist obtains a chromatogram for a standard sample of pure acetylsalicylic acid. The time elapsed between the injection of the sample and the maximum height of the resulting peak is defined as the retention time ($t_R$). The width of the peak at its base, estimated by extrapolating the relatively straight sides of the peak down to the baseline, is denoted as the baseline peak width ($W_b$).\n\nFrom the experiment, the retention time ($t_R$) for the acetylsalicylic acid peak is measured to be 8.50 minutes, and the baseline peak width ($W_b$) is 0.475 minutes.
