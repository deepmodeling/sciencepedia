This practice problem presents a thought-provoking scenario where the elution order of two compounds reverses when switching from an isocratic to a gradient method. By dissecting this apparent contradiction, you will explore the dynamic and crucial effect of changing mobile phase composition on the ionization state of acidic or basic analytes, a key concept in advanced method development. [@problem_id:1452289]", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with separating a mixture of two compounds using Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) with a C18 stationary phase. The two compounds are Benzoic Acid (analyte A, a weak organic acid with a $pK_a$ of approximately 4.2) and Naphthalene (analyte B, a neutral, nonpolar hydrocarbon).\n\nThe chemist first attempts a separation using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 30% acetonitrile and 70% aqueous buffer maintained at a constant pH of 5.0. In this experiment, analyte A elutes from the column before analyte B.\n\nNext, the chemist tries a gradient elution method. The run starts with the same mobile phase (30% acetonitrile, 70% aqueous buffer at pH 5.0), but the concentration of acetonitrile is linearly increased to 95% over a period of 10 minutes. Under these gradient conditions, the chemist is surprised to find that the elution order has reversed: analyte B now elutes before analyte A.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate scientific explanation for this observed reversal in elution order between the isocratic and gradient methods?\n\nA. The retention of benzoic acid is much more sensitive to the mobile phase composition than that of naphthalene. As the gradient increases the acetonitrile concentration, the polarity of the mobile phase decreases, which suppresses the ionization of benzoic acid. This shift toward its neutral form makes it significantly more nonpolar and thus more strongly retained, causing it to elute only at the very high organic solvent concentrations reached late in the gradient, after naphthalene has already eluted.\n\nB. The viscosity of the mobile phase decreases as the gradient progresses. This leads to a substantial increase in the longitudinal diffusion of the smaller naphthalene molecule, causing it to travel through the column much faster and elute before the larger benzoic acid molecule.\n\nC. Naphthalene has a much higher solubility in acetonitrile than benzoic acid. In the gradient run, as the acetonitrile concentration rapidly increases, the naphthalene is effectively \"washed out\" of the column before the benzoic acid has a chance to interact with the mobile phase.\n\nD. Gradient elution programs inherently generate significant heat. This temperature increase during the run selectively decreases the van der Waals interactions between naphthalene and the C18 stationary phase, reducing its retention time, but does not affect the interactions of benzoic acid.\n\nE. In the initial isocratic run at pH 5.0, the benzoic acid is fully protonated and neutral, making it more nonpolar than naphthalene. The observed elution of A before B must be due to an experimental artifact, and the gradient method simply reveals the true elution order.", "solution": "In reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 stationary phase, retention increases with analyte hydrophobicity and decreases as the organic volume fraction, denoted by $\\phi$, of the mobile phase increases. For neutral analytes, the Snyder–Soczewinski relation holds:\n$$\n\\log_{10} k(\\phi) = \\log_{10} k_{w} - S \\phi, \\quad S>0,\n$$\nso that $k$ decreases monotonically as $\\phi$ increases.\n\nIsocratic case at $\\phi=0.30$ and $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$: Benzoic acid (analyte A) is a weak acid with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}\\approx 4.2$. Its degree of ionization at a given $\\mathrm{pH}$ is governed by the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_{a} + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}\\right), \\quad\nf_{\\mathrm{HA}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}}}.\n$$\nWith $\\mathrm{pH}-\\mathrm{p}K_{a} > 0$, $f_{\\mathrm{HA}}\\ll 1$, so analyte A is predominantly anionic, which is very weakly retained in RP-HPLC. Naphthalene (analyte B) is neutral and nonpolar, hence strongly retained. Therefore A elutes before B under the isocratic condition, as observed.\n\nGradient case with $\\phi$ ramping from $0.30$ to $0.95$ over $10$ minutes: For analyte B (neutral), the retention factor follows\n$$\n\\log_{10} k_{B}(\\phi) = \\log_{10} k_{w,B} - S_{B}\\phi,\n$$\nso $k_{B}(\\phi)$ decreases steadily with increasing $\\phi$, and B elutes when $k_{B}(\\phi)$ becomes sufficiently small.\n\nFor analyte A (weak acid), the effective or apparent acidity constant depends on solvent composition. In mixed aqueous–organic media, the apparent $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ increases with $\\phi$ for weak acids, and the effective $\\mathrm{pH}$ sensed by the analyte decreases relative to the aqueous-calibrated reading as $\\phi$ increases. Denote these by $\\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi)$ and $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi)$. Then\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]} = 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi) - \\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi)}, \\quad\nf_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi) - \\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi)}}.\n$$\nAs $\\phi$ increases, $\\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi)$ increases and $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{app}}(\\phi)$ decreases, so $f_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)$ increases: ionization is suppressed and A becomes more neutral. The composite retention factor is\n$$\nk_{A}(\\phi) = f_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)\\,k_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi) + \\bigl(1 - f_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)\\bigr)\\,k_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}(\\phi),\n$$\nwith $k_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}(\\phi)\\approx 0$ on C18 and $k_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)$ decreasing with $\\phi$ per Snyder–Soczewinski. Because $f_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)$ increases markedly during the gradient, $k_{A}(\\phi)\\approx f_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)\\,k_{\\mathrm{HA}}(\\phi)$ can remain comparatively large until higher $\\phi$, whereas $k_{B}(\\phi)$ for naphthalene decreases smoothly throughout. Consequently, B reaches the low-$k$ condition earlier in the gradient and elutes before A, reversing the order observed in the isocratic run.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that increasing organic content suppresses the ionization of benzoic acid, shifting it to its neutral, more strongly retained form late in the gradient, leading to elution after naphthalene. This corresponds to option A. Options B, C, and D invoke mechanisms that do not control retention order in RP-HPLC, and option E contradicts the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation at $\\mathrm{pH}=5.0$ for a weak acid with $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}\\approx 4.2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1452289"}, {"introduction": "A successful separation depends not only on chemical principles but also on the physical characteristics of the HPLC instrument.
