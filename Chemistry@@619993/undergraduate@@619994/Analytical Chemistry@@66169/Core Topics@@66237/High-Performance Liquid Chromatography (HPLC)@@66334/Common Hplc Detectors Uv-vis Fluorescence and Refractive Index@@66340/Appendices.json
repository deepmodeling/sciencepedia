The separation is monitored with a differential Refractive Index (RI) detector. This type of detector continuously measures the difference in refractive index ($\\Delta n$) between the eluent passing through a sample cell and a static portion of the pure mobile phase held in a reference cell. The detector's output signal is directly proportional to this difference. By convention, a positive signal, which results in a positive chromatographic peak, occurs when the refractive index of the liquid in the sample cell is greater than that of the reference cell.\n\nThe mobile phase used for the separation has a refractive index of $n_{\\text{mobile phase}} = 1.352$. For the dilute concentrations used in HPLC, the refractive index of the solution in the sample cell as an analyte elutes is lower than $n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$ if the pure analyte's refractive index is lower than $n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$, and higher if the pure analyte's RI is higher.\n\nThe pure compounds have the following refractive indices:\n- Compound X: $n_X = 1.364$\n- Compound Y: $n_Y = 1.341$\n\nIn the developed chromatographic method, compound Y elutes from the column before compound X.

When a peak elutes, the eluent is a dilute solution of the analyte in the mobile phase. Let's call the refractive index of this solution $n_{\\text{solution}}$.\nSo, $S \\propto n_{\\text{solution}} - n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\n\nThe problem states that a positive peak is observed when the signal is positive, which means $n_{\\text{solution}} > n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$. Conversely, a negative peak is observed when $n_{\\text{solution}} < n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\nThe problem also provides the crucial link between the analyte's refractive index ($n_{\\text{analyte}}$) and the solution's refractive index ($n_{\\text{solution}}$):\n- If $n_{\\text{analyte}} > n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$, then $n_{\\text{solution}} > n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\n- If $n_{\\text{analyte}} < n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$, then $n_{\\text{solution}} < n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\n\nWe are given that compound Y elutes before compound X. This means the first peak in the chromatogram corresponds to compound Y, and the second peak corresponds to compound X.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Compound Y (the first peak)**\nThe refractive index of pure compound Y is $n_Y = 1.341$.\nThe refractive index of the mobile phase is $n_{\\text{mobile phase}} = 1.352$.\nWe compare the two values: $1.341 < 1.352$, so $n_Y < n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\nAccording to the principle given, when compound Y elutes, the refractive index of the solution in the sample cell will be less than that of the mobile phase, i.e., $n_{\\text{solution}} < n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\nThis results in a refractive index difference of $\\Delta n = n_{\\text{solution}} - n_{\\text{mobile phase}} < 0$.\nA negative $\\Delta n$ corresponds to a negative signal and thus a **negative** peak for compound Y.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Compound X (the second peak)**\nThe refractive index of pure compound X is $n_X = 1.364$.\nThe refractive index of the mobile phase is $n_{\\text{mobile phase}} = 1.352$.\nWe compare the two values: $1.364 > 1.352$, so $n_X > n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\nAccording to the principle given, when compound X elutes, the refractive index of the solution in the sample cell will be greater than that of the mobile phase, i.e., $n_{\\text{solution}} > n_{\\text{mobile phase}}$.\nThis results in a refractive index difference of $\\Delta n = n_{\\text{solution}} - n_{\\text{mobile phase}} > 0$.\nA positive $\\Delta n$ corresponds to a positive signal and thus a **positive** peak for compound X.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results**\nThe first peak (compound Y) is negative.\nThe second peak (compound X) is positive.\nThis matches the description in option D.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. Both peaks will be positive. (Incorrect)\nB. The peak for compound X will be negative, and the peak for compound Y will be positive. (Incorrect, the signs are reversed)\nC.
