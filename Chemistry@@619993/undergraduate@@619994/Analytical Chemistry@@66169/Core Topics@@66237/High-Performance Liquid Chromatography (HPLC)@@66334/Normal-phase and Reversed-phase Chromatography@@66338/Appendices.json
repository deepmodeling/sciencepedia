Pentane is a nonpolar hydrocarbon. Diethyl ether is moderately polar due to the ether oxygen and can act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, but it lacks hydrogen-bond donation. 1-Butanol is more polar because of the hydroxyl group, which enables both hydrogen-bond donation and acceptance.

This practice shifts the focus from retention time to peak shape by exploring a common laboratory issue: the solvent effect. You will analyze what happens when a sample is injected in a solvent that is significantly stronger than the mobile phase, helping you develop crucial troubleshooting skills for diagnosing and correcting peak-distorting phenomena like fronting. [@problem_id:1458554]", "problem": "An analytical chemist is developing a method to separate a moderately nonpolar analyte using reversed-phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The separation is performed on a column packed with a nonpolar C18 stationary phase. The mobile phase is a relatively polar mixture of 70% water and 30% acetonitrile. Due to poor solubility of the analyte in the mobile phase, the chemist dissolves the sample in a small volume of pure isopropanol, which is a much stronger (less polar) solvent than the mobile phase. The sample is then injected onto the column.\n\nAssuming the analyte is well-retained under normal conditions with a mobile-phase-matched solvent, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected effect on the analyte's chromatographic peak shape and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The peak will exhibit significant tailing, because the strong sample solvent creates secondary interaction sites on the stationary phase, leading to slower desorption for a fraction of the analyte molecules.\n\nB. The peak will be significantly sharper and have a shorter retention time, because the strong sample solvent ensures the analyte is rapidly and efficiently transferred onto the stationary phase as a very narrow initial band.\n\nC. The peak shape will be largely unaffected, because the small injection volume of the strong solvent is quickly diluted by the bulk mobile phase, rendering its effect negligible.\n\nD.

The peak will be completely lost, as the strong solvent will cause the analyte to irreversibly bind to the nonpolar stationary phase.", "solution": "We consider reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 stationary phase with a relatively polar mobile phase (water and acetonitrile), and an analyte that is well retained when injected in a solvent matched to the mobile phase. The sample is instead dissolved in pure isopropanol, which is a much stronger (less polar) solvent than the bulk mobile phase. The key chromatographic principle governing retention in isocratic reversed-phase HPLC is that the retention factor $k$ decreases as the mobile phase becomes stronger (i.e., more organic or a stronger solvent). A common empirical relation is Snyder’s solvent strength model,\n$$\n\\log_{10} k \\;=\\; \\log_{10} k_{w} \\;-\\; S\\,\\phi,\n$$\nwhere $k_{w}$ is the extrapolated retention factor in pure water, $S$ is a solute-dependent constant, and $\\phi$ is the volume fraction (or effective strength) of the organic modifier. A stronger solvent (larger effective strength) yields a smaller $k$.\n\nThe retention time in isocratic elution is related to $k$ by\n$$\nt_{R} \\;=\\; t_{0}\\,(1 + k),\n$$\nwhere $t_{0}$ is the column dead time. The effective migration velocity of the analyte band can be expressed as\n$$\nv_{\\text{eff}} \\;=\\; \\frac{u}{1 + k},\n$$\nwith $u$ being the interstitial mobile-phase linear velocity. Hence, a smaller $k$ results in a larger $v_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nWhen the analyte is injected in a strong solvent plug (isopropanol), the local mobile-phase composition within the injection zone is much stronger than the bulk mobile phase. Therefore, within the strong solvent plug, the analyte experiences a much smaller local retention factor $k_{\\text{plug}}$ than it would under the bulk composition, $k_{\\text{bulk}}$. By the equations above, the fraction of analyte residing in the strong plug travels with a larger $v_{\\text{eff}}$ and attains a shorter local retention. As the plug disperses and mixes with the bulk mobile phase, the remaining analyte outside the strong zone is subject to the larger $k_{\\text{bulk}}$ and thus migrates more slowly.\n\nThis differential in migration speeds produces a composite peak in which the front (leading edge) is formed by analyte molecules that remained in the strong solvent zone and advanced rapidly, while the remainder lags behind under the weaker bulk mobile phase. The characteristic distortion is significant fronting (a leading edge or shoulder), sometimes accompanied by band broadening rather than sharpening, because there is no band focusing at the column head when the injection solvent is stronger than the mobile phase. Band focusing occurs when the sample solvent is weaker than the mobile phase; here, the opposite is true, so de-focusing and leading are expected.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect: strong solvent does not create secondary interaction sites causing tailing; tailing typically arises from slow desorption due to specific active sites or adsorption heterogeneity, not from a stronger sample solvent.\n- Option B is incorrect: a strong sample solvent prevents focusing and instead causes de-focusing; peaks are typically broadened with a leading edge, not sharpened.\n- Option C is incorrect: although a very small injection volume can mitigate the effect, a strong solvent mismatch commonly produces observable fronting for retained analytes; the premise specifies a strong mismatch and poor solubility necessitating the strong solvent.\n- Option E is incorrect: a stronger sample solvent reduces analyte retention rather than causing irreversible binding; irreversible binding would not be caused by a strong eluent.\n\nThe correct outcome and reasoning are captured by Option D: significant fronting due to a fraction of the analyte traveling rapidly within the strong solvent plug ahead of the portion that has mixed with the weaker bulk mobile phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1458554"}]}
