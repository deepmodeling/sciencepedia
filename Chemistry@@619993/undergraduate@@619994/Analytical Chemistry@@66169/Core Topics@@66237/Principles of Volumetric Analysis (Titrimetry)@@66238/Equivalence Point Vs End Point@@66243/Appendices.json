{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "In any titration, the ideal goal is to stop adding titrant at the exact stoichiometric equivalence point. However, in practice, we rely on an observable physical change, the end point, which is often detected by a chemical indicator. This first exercise [@problem_id:1485086] explores the fundamental consequences of a mismatch between these two points. By analyzing a classic scenario where the indicator changes color after the equivalence point has been passed, you will develop an intuitive understanding of how this common experimental error propagates into your final calculated result.", "problem": "An analytical chemistry student is assigned the task of determining the molar concentration of a solution of a weak monoprotic base, represented as B. The student titrates a sample of the base solution with an initial volume $V_B$ using a standardized solution of hydrochloric acid ($\\text{HCl}$), a strong acid, of known concentration $C_A$. The reaction is a one-to-one stoichiometry: $B + H^{+} \\rightarrow BH^{+}$.\n\nThe equivalence point of this titration occurs at a specific pH value less than 7. However, the student mistakenly chooses a pH indicator that completes its color change at a pH value significantly lower than the pH of the true equivalence point. Consequently, the student stops the titration and records the volume of the acid titrant added, $V_{end}$, only after the true equivalence point has been passed. The student then uses this recorded volume, $V_{end}$, to calculate the concentration of the weak base, $C_B$.\n\nAssuming no other experimental errors occurred, which of the following statements correctly describes the outcome of the student's calculation?\n\nA. The calculated concentration $C_B$ will be erroneously high.\n\nB. The calculated concentration $C_B$ will be erroneously low.\n\nC. The calculated concentration $C_B$ will be correct, as the error in pH is compensated for by the precision of the volumetric glassware.\n\nD. The effect on the calculated concentration $C_B$ cannot be determined without knowing the base dissociation constant, $K_b$, of the weak base.\n\nE. The calculated concentration $C_B$ will be correct because the reaction follows a one-to-one stoichiometry.", "solution": "We consider the acid-base reaction with one-to-one stoichiometry:\n$$\nB + H^{+} \\rightarrow BH^{+}.\n$$\nBy the definition of the equivalence point in a titration, the equivalence condition is governed solely by stoichiometry: the moles of added strong acid equal the initial moles of weak base. If $V_{eq}$ is the true equivalence volume of the acid titrant and $C_A$ is its concentration, while $V_B$ and $C_B$ are the initial volume and concentration of the base solution, then the equivalence condition is\n$$\nC_A V_{eq} = C_B V_B.\n$$\nSolving for the true base concentration gives\n$$\nC_B = \\frac{C_A V_{eq}}{V_B}.\n$$\nThe indicator chosen completes its color change at a pH significantly lower than the pH at the true equivalence point. In a weak-base/strong-acid titration, the pH decreases as acid is added, and the equivalence point occurs at a pH less than $7$, but still higher than the endpoint pH of the chosen indicator. Therefore, the color change (endpoint) occurs only after the true equivalence point has been surpassed. Consequently, the recorded endpoint volume satisfies\n$$\nV_{end} > V_{eq}.\n$$\nThe student computes the base concentration using the endpoint volume,\n$$\nC_{B,\\text{calc}} = \\frac{C_A V_{end}}{V_B}.\n$$\nComparing to the true concentration,\n$$\nC_{B,\\text{calc}} = \\frac{C_A V_{end}}{V_B} > \\frac{C_A V_{eq}}{V_B} = C_B,\n$$\nso the calculated concentration is erroneously high.\n\nThis conclusion follows from stoichiometry and the direction of the pH error; it does not depend on $K_b$, because the volume at equivalence is determined purely by mole balance, not by the pH value. It is also not corrected by glassware precision, and one-to-one stoichiometry does not rescue an incorrect volume measurement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1485086"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond a purely qualitative assessment, this next practice challenges you to precisely quantify the titration error.
