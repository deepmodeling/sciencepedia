The radiant power of this stray light is constant and has been measured to be 0.800% of the radiant power transmitted through a reference cell containing only the solvent, $P_0$.

The transmittance is the ratio of radiant power transmitted through the sample ($P$) to that transmitted through the reference ($P_0$), so $T = P/P_0$.
