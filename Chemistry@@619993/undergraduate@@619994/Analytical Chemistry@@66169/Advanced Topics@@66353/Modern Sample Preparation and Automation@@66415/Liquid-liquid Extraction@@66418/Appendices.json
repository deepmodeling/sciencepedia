An emulsion consists of fine droplets stabilized at the interface; to break it efficiently and safely, one should modify solution properties to promote droplet coalescence and phase separation without increasing hazard.\n\nThe most effective simple approach is to increase the ionic strength of the aqueous phase to induce a salting-out effect.
