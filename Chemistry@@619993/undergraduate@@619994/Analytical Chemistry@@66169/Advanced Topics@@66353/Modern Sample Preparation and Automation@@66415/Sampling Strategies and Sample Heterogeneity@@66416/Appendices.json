This exercise uses a familiar example—a bag of mixed nuts—to introduce a fundamental statistical tool: the sample standard deviation, $s$.

The marketing department claims the product contains 20% cashews by weight, but the production team is concerned about the uniformity of the mix. A non-uniform distribution, known as heterogeneity, can lead to customer dissatisfaction even if the overall batch composition is correct.\n\nTo quantify this heterogeneity, you take a series of small samples, called increments, from a large 1.00 kg container of the mixed nuts. You collect five separate increments, each having a mass of precisely 50.0 g. For each increment, you meticulously separate the cashews from the other nuts and weigh them. The masses of the cashews isolated from each of the five increments are recorded as follows:\n- Increment 1: 11.2 g\n- Increment 2: 9.8 g\n- Increment 3: 10.5 g\n- Increment 4: 8.9 g\n- Increment 5: 11.6 g\n\nA key industrial metric for characterizing the variability arising from product heterogeneity is the sample standard deviation of the mass of the component of interest (in this case, cashews) across the collected increments. Calculate this value based on your measurements.\n\nExpress your final answer in grams, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "We have five measured cashew masses (in grams): $x_{1}=11.2$, $x_{2}=9.8$, $x_{3}=10.5$, $x_{4}=8.9$, $x_{5}=11.6$, with $n=5$.\n\nThe sample mean is computed using\n$$\n\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}.\n$$\nFirst compute the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5}x_{i}=11.2+9.8+10.5+8.9+11.6=52.0,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\bar{x}=\\frac{52.0}{5}=10.4.\n$$\n\nThe sample standard deviation is\n$$\ns=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\nCompute each deviation and its square:\n$$\nx_{1}-\\bar{x}=0.8,\\quad (x_{1}-\\bar{x})^{2}=0.64,\n$$\n$$\nx_{2}-\\bar{x}=-0.6,\\quad (x_{2}-\\bar{x})^{2}=0.36,\n$$\n$$\nx_{3}-\\bar{x}=0.1,\\quad (x_{3}-\\bar{x})^{2}=0.01,\n$$\n$$\nx_{4}-\\bar{x}=-1.5,\\quad (x_{4}-\\bar{x})^{2}=2.25,\n$$\n$$\nx_{5}-\\bar{x}=1.2,\\quad (x_{5}-\\bar{x})^{2}=1.44.\n$$\nSum of squared deviations:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5}\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}=0.64+0.36+0.01+2.25+1.44=4.70.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\ns=\\sqrt{\\frac{4.70}{5-1}}=\\sqrt{1.175}\\approx 1.084.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, the sample standard deviation is $1.08$ in grams.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.08}$$", "id": "1469419"}, {"introduction": "Once we can measure heterogeneity, the next step is to design sampling strategies that account for it. When a material or area isn't uniformly heterogeneous but consists of distinct zones (strata) with different properties, a simple random sample may not be efficient. This practice introduces stratified sampling, a powerful technique where we divide the population into strata and sample them independently, allowing us to create a more precise overall estimate [@problem_id:1469431]. You will apply optimal allocation, a method that directs more sampling effort towards more variable strata to maximize efficiency.", "problem": "An environmental chemist is designing a sampling plan to measure the average concentration of a new herbicide in a 50-hectare agricultural test field. The field consists of two distinct soil zones: Zone L, a 20-hectare area of loam, and Zone C, a 30-hectare area of clay. It is known from prior studies that the variability of chemical concentrations differs between the two zones. A pilot study provided the following estimates for the standard deviations of the herbicide concentration:\n- Standard deviation in Zone L: $s_L = 0.60$ mg/kg\n- Standard deviation in Zone C: $s_C = 1.10$ mg/kg\n\nThe chemist decides to use a stratified sampling strategy to account for the soil heterogeneity. A total of 90 samples will be collected. To maximize the precision of the estimate for the overall mean concentration, the chemist will use optimal allocation (also known as Neyman allocation). In this scheme, the number of samples collected from each stratum (zone) is made proportional to the product of the stratum's relative area and its standard deviation.\n\nGiven a total of 90 samples, how many samples should be collected from Zone C to adhere to the optimal allocation plan? The number of samples must be an integer.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the number of samples to be taken from Zone C ($n_C$) using an optimal allocation strategy for a total of $n_{total} = 90$ samples.\n\nFirst, we identify the parameters for each stratum (Zone L and Zone C).\nThe total area of the field is $A_{total} = 20 \\text{ ha} + 30 \\text{ ha} = 50 \\text{ ha}$.\n\nFor Zone L:\nArea $A_L = 20$ ha.\nStandard deviation $s_L = 0.60$ mg/kg.\nThe relative area, or weight, of Zone L is $W_L = \\frac{A_L}{A_{total}} = \\frac{20}{50} = 0.4$.\n\nFor Zone C:\nArea $A_C = 30$ ha.\nStandard deviation $s_C = 1.10$ mg/kg.\nThe relative area, or weight, of Zone C is $W_C = \\frac{A_C}{A_{total}} = \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6$.\n\nThe principle of optimal (Neyman) allocation states that the number of samples taken from each stratum $i$, denoted $n_i$, should be proportional to the product of the stratum's weight $W_i$ and its standard deviation $s_i$.\nMathematically, this is expressed as $n_i \\propto W_i s_i$.\n\nThe fraction of the total samples to be allocated to stratum $i$ is therefore given by the ratio of its allocation factor ($W_i s_i$) to the sum of all allocation factors:\n$$f_i = \\frac{W_i s_i}{\\sum_j W_j s_j}$$\n\nWe need to calculate this fraction for Zone C ($f_C$) and then multiply it by the total number of samples, $n_{total}$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the allocation factor for each zone:\nAllocation factor for Zone L: $W_L s_L = 0.4 \\times 0.60 = 0.24$.\nAllocation factor for Zone C: $W_C s_C = 0.6 \\times 1.10 = 0.66$.\n\nNext, we compute the sum of the allocation factors:\n$\\sum_j W_j s_j = W_L s_L + W_C s_C = 0.24 + 0.66 = 0.90$.\n\nNow, we can find the number of samples to be collected from Zone C, $n_C$:\n$$n_C = n_{total} \\times f_C = n_{total} \\times \\frac{W_C s_C}{W_L s_L + W_C s_C}$$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$n_C = 90 \\times \\frac{0.66}{0.90}$$\n$$n_C = 90 \\times \\frac{66}{90}$$\n$$n_C = 66$$\n\nThe number of samples to be collected from Zone C is 66.\nFor completeness, the number of samples from Zone L would be:\n$$n_L = n_{total} - n_C = 90 - 66 = 24$$\nAlternatively, using the formula for $n_L$:\n$$n_L = 90 \\times \\frac{W_L s_L}{W_L s_L + W_C s_C} = 90 \\times \\frac{0.24}{0.90} = 90 \\times \\frac{24}{90} = 24$$\nThe sum $n_L + n_C = 24 + 66 = 90$, which matches the total number of samples.
