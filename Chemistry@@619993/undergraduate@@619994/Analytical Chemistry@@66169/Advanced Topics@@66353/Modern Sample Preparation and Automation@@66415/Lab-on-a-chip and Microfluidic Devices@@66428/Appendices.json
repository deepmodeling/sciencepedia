The design of the channel ensures a very large aspect ratio, where $w_0 \\gg h_0$. For a new experiment, an engineer plans to continuously flow toluene through this channel. However, PDMS is known to swell significantly when in contact with nonpolar organic solvents like toluene. After prolonged exposure, the PDMS material reaches an equilibrium state where it has swollen isotropically. This equilibrium swelling is characterized by a volume swelling ratio of $S_V = 1.42$, defined as the ratio of the final swollen volume of the polymer to its initial dry volume. The isotropic swelling causes all linear dimensions of the PDMS block, and consequently the channel embedded within it, to expand by the same factor.
