This exercise explores what happens when a sample is not uniform, leading to a fundamental type of systematic sampling error. By considering a scenario involving a settled slurry, you will learn to identify how physical processes can sabotage an analysis before it even begins [@problem_id:1468967].", "problem": "An environmental chemist is tasked with determining the average concentration of a dense, water-insoluble contaminant, lead(II) sulfide ($\\text{PbS}$), in a large batch of soil collected from a former industrial site. To prepare the sample for analysis, the chemist takes a representative 100 g portion of the bulk soil, grinds it into a fine powder, and mixes it with 1 liter of deionized water to form a uniform slurry. The chemist then leaves the slurry undisturbed on the lab bench for one hour to attend a meeting. Upon returning, the chemist observes that the heavier soil particles have settled, leaving a clearer layer of water on top. Without re-homogenizing the mixture, a 10 mL aliquot is carefully pipetted from the top liquid layer for subsequent acid digestion and analysis by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).\n\nAssuming the analytical instrument is perfectly calibrated and the digestion procedure is flawless, which of the following options best categorizes the primary error introduced by taking the aliquot from the undisturbed slurry?\n\nA. Random instrumental error\nB. Personal error\nC. Systematic matrix error\nD. Systematic sampling error\nE. Random sampling error", "solution": "The contaminant $\\text{PbS}$ is described as dense and water-insoluble. When the soil-water slurry is left undisturbed, gravitational settling causes heavier particles to accumulate at the bottom while the supernatant becomes depleted of those dense particulates. Sampling a 10 mL aliquot from the top without re-homogenization preferentially collects the clearer liquid phase, which is systematically deficient in the particulate-bound analyte.\n\nThis introduces a bias: the aliquot under-represents the true average concentration of $\\text{PbS}$ in the original 100 g soil portion. If this sampling approach were repeated under the same conditions, it would consistently yield low measurements. Therefore, the error is not random but directional and reproducible.\n\nIt is not a random instrumental error because the instrument is assumed perfectly calibrated and the digestion flawless, and the mechanism of error arises before measurement. It is not a personal error in the sense of a one-off mistake such as misreading or mishandling, but rather a procedural choice that induces a consistent bias. It is not a systematic matrix error, which would involve chemical or physical interferences during measurement due to the sample matrix affecting the analytical signal. Instead, the problem lies in how the sample was taken from a physically segregated mixture. It is also not a random sampling error, which would arise from stochastic variability in sub-sampling; the observed effect is not stochastic but systematically low due to settling.\n\nThus, the primary error is a systematic sampling error caused by non-representative sampling from a stratified slurry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1468967"}, {"introduction": "Once a representative sample is collected, it must be prepared for analysis, often involving homogenization. However, the tools we use can sometimes betray us by introducing contaminants, a critical issue in trace analysis. This problem presents a classic case of analytical detective work, challenging you to pinpoint the source of an unexpectedly high result by scrutinizing the materials used in the lab procedure [@problem_id:1468897].", "problem": "An undergraduate student in an environmental chemistry course is tasked with determining the concentration of trace zinc (Zn) in a soil sample collected from a site near an old metal plating facility. The established laboratory procedure is as follows:\n1. The soil sample is dried in an oven.\n2. The dried sample is homogenized by passing it through a sieve.\n3. A precisely weighed portion of the homogenized sample is digested in hot, concentrated nitric acid inside a glass beaker.\n4. The resulting solution is filtered and diluted to a known volume with high-purity deionized water.\n5. The final solution's zinc concentration is measured using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).\n\nThe student follows the procedure and obtains a zinc concentration that is over ten times higher than the expected background levels for the area. A review of the student's detailed lab notes is conducted to find the source of this significant positive error. Which of the following observations noted by the student is the most probable cause of the erroneously high zinc measurement?\n\nA. The soil sample was initially collected and stored in a sealed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle.\nB. A brass sieve was used to homogenize the dried soil sample before digestion.\nC. The acid digestion was performed using concentrated nitric acid in a borosilicate glass beaker.\nD. The deionized water used for dilution had a measured resistivity of 18 MΩ·cm.\nE. The AAS instrument was calibrated using a series of certified zinc standard solutions, each prepared in a 2% nitric acid matrix.", "solution": "We analyze each procedural observation for its potential to introduce a positive bias in the measured zinc concentration by considering contamination pathways and matrix effects. A positive bias manifests when the measured concentration exceeds the true sample concentration due to external zinc addition, so that\n$$\nC_{\\text{meas}}=C_{\\text{true}}+C_{\\text{contam}},\n$$\nwith $C_{\\text{contam}}>0$ arising from materials or reagents that contribute zinc which is then solubilized during digestion and measured by AAS.\n\nA. Collection and storage in a sealed high-density polyethylene bottle is standard practice for trace metals. HDPE is chemically inert toward nitric acid digests and does not contain zinc as a structural component. Thus it is not a plausible source of significant $C_{\\text{contam}}$.\n\nB. Use of a brass sieve to homogenize dried soil is a highly probable zinc contamination source. Brass is an alloy composed primarily of copper and zinc; let $f_{\\text{Zn}}$ denote the mass fraction of zinc in the brass. Mechanical abrasion during sieving transfers a mass $m_{\\text{abr}}$ of brass particles to the sample, introducing zinc mass\n$$\nm_{\\text{Zn,contam}}=f_{\\text{Zn}}\\,m_{\\text{abr}}.\n$$\nThis zinc will be quantitatively dissolved during nitric acid digestion, and upon dilution to a final volume $V_{\\text{final}}$ the added zinc concentration is\n$$\n\\Delta C=\\frac{m_{\\text{Zn,contam}}}{V_{\\text{final}}}=\\frac{f_{\\text{Zn}}\\,m_{\\text{abr}}}{V_{\\text{final}}}.\n$$\nBecause $f_{\\text{Zn}}$ in brass is substantial and $m_{\\text{abr}}$ need not be large to yield a sizable $\\Delta C$, this pathway can readily produce a concentration that is over an order of magnitude above background. This is the canonical source of falsely elevated zinc when brass contact occurs before digestion.\n\nC. Performing nitric acid digestion in a borosilicate glass beaker can leach certain glass constituents (e.g., boron or sodium), but zinc is not a typical or significant component of borosilicate glass formulations. Any zinc leaching from glass is negligible compared to a tenfold elevation and would normally be detected and controlled via reagent and vessel blanks. Therefore, this is not the most probable cause of a large positive error for zinc.\n\nD. High-resistivity deionized water indicative of ultrapure Type I water minimizes ionic contamination. Such water is standard for trace metal analysis and does not contribute meaningful zinc contamination. Thus $C_{\\text{contam}}$ from this source is effectively zero.\n\nE. Calibration with certified zinc standards prepared in a nitric acid matrix that matches the sample matrix minimizes matrix effects and adsorption losses, supporting accurate calibration. This procedure does not cause a positive bias; rather, it improves accuracy.\n\nBy elimination and mechanistic plausibility based on alloy composition and sample contact before digestion, the most probable cause of the erroneously high zinc measurement is the use of a brass sieve, which introduces zinc that is then measured by AAS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1468897"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, we would prevent all contamination, but in practice, some sources like leaching from storage containers are difficult to eliminate completely. This is where quality control measures, such as blanks, become indispensable tools for the analytical chemist. This practice demonstrates how to use a 'storage blank' to quantify and correct for contamination, allowing you to determine the true analyte concentration in your sample [@problem_id:1468966].", "problem": "An environmental chemistry laboratory is tasked with measuring trace levels of the organic contaminant Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a common plasticizer, in a water sample collected from a remote, pristine alpine lake.
