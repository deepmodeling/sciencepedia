Developing this deductive skill is essential for obtaining reliable data and maintaining a robust analytical method.", "problem": "An analytical chemist is using a Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) system to determine the concentration of nitrite in water samples. The method involves injecting a sample into a carrier stream containing a colorimetric reagent. The mixture then flows through a reaction coil and into a flow cell positioned in a spectrophotometric detector set to a specific wavelength. The system is designed to produce a transient signal, or fiagram, where the peak height is proportional to the analyte concentration.\n\nDuring the analysis of a particular sample, the chemist observes that while the baseline signal is stable and low-noise, the recorded fiagram, which should be a single smooth peak, is instead overlaid with several very sharp, narrow, and randomly occurring spikes of high intensity. These spikes are not reproducible in subsequent injections of the same sample.

The viscosity of the sample is significantly different from the carrier stream, causing poor dispersion.", "solution": "The goal of this problem is to diagnose a specific issue in a Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) system based on the characteristics of the output signal (the fiagram). The key observation is the presence of \"sharp, narrow, and randomly occurring spikes\" superimposed on the expected analytical peak. We must evaluate each option to see which physical phenomenon would produce such a signal.\n\nThe detector is a spectrophotometer, which measures the absorbance of light passing through the sample in a flow cell. According to the Beer-Lambert law, absorbance is related to the concentration of the absorbing species. Any phenomenon that abruptly and significantly changes the amount of light reaching the detector will cause a spike in the signal.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. The peristaltic pump is generating excessive flow pulsations.**\nA peristaltic pump works by compressing a flexible tube with a series of rotating rollers. This action inherently creates a non-uniform, or pulsating, flow. These pulsations in flow rate would cause the concentration of the analyte in the detector cell to fluctuate, leading to oscillations in the absorbance signal. However, these oscillations would be regular and periodic, synchronized with the rotation of the pump rollers. The problem describes the spikes as *randomly occurring*, which contradicts the periodic nature of pump pulsations. Therefore, this is not the most likely cause.\n\n**B. The injected sample concentration is too high, causing detector saturation.**\nIf the analyte concentration is too high, the absorbance may exceed the linear dynamic range of the spectrophotometer. As the peak of the sample plug passes through the detector, the absorbance will rise and then plateau at the maximum value the detector can measure. This results in a \"flat-topped\" peak. This phenomenon does not produce sharp, narrow spikes; rather, it distorts the top of the main analytical peak. Therefore, this is incorrect.\n\n**C. The reagents in the carrier stream are slowly degrading over the course of the experiment.**\nIf the colorimetric reagent in the carrier stream were degrading, its ability to react with the analyte and produce the colored product would change over time. This would typically manifest as a slow, steady drift in the baseline signal or a gradual decrease in the peak heights for standards run over a long period (e.g., hours). It would not cause rapid, sharp, random spikes on the timescale of a single injection (which is typically seconds to a minute). Therefore, this is not the correct explanation.\n\n**D. Small air bubbles are being intermittently introduced into the flow path and are passing through the detector's flow cell.**\nThis is the most plausible explanation. An air bubble entering the spectrophotometer's flow cell displaces the liquid medium. The interface between the liquid and the air bubble has a large difference in refractive index, causing significant light scattering. The detector interprets this sudden loss of transmitted light (due to scattering) as a massive, instantaneous increase in absorbance. This creates a very sharp, narrow, and intense spike in the signal. Since bubbles can be introduced randomly (e.g., from a loose fitting or outgassing of a solution), the appearance of these spikes would be random and not reproducible. This perfectly matches the description in the problem.\n\n**E. The viscosity of the sample is significantly different from the carrier stream, causing poor dispersion.**\nA mismatch in viscosity between the sample and the carrier stream affects the dispersion of the injected sample plug. Typically, a more viscous sample will disperse less, leading to a sharper, less symmetric peak, while a less viscous sample might exhibit more complex flow patterns. This phenomenon affects the overall shape (width, symmetry, and height) of the main analytical peak. It does not, however, create sharp, transient spikes *on top of* the peak. Therefore, this is not the cause of the observed artifact.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy evaluating all the options, the only phenomenon that accounts for sharp, narrow, and random spikes in a spectrophotometric FIA signal is the passage of air bubbles through the flow cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1441042"}, {"introduction": "Modern FIA has evolved into powerful, computer-controlled techniques like Multicommuted Flow Injection Analysis (MCFIA), capable of performing complex analytical procedures automatically.
