The established protocol involves homogenizing a 10.0 g sample, followed by a liquid-liquid extraction with 10.0 mL of acetonitrile. Phase separation is then induced by adding a salt mixture containing 4.0 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate ($\\text{MgSO}_4$) and 1.0 g of sodium chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$). The purpose of the $\\text{MgSO}_4$ is to act as a drying agent, absorbing water to promote the separation of the acetonitrile layer, while both salts contribute to a \"salting-out\" effect.\n\nThe chemist wishes to analyze a smaller 5.0 g sample and decides to scale down all reagents proportionally. They use 5.0 mL of acetonitrile and a salt mixture of 2.0 g of $\\text{MgSO}_4$ and 0.5 g of $\\text{NaCl}$. The procedure fails, as a distinct upper layer of acetonitrile does not form, preventing its collection for analysis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best physical and chemical explanation for this failure?\n\nA. The amount of $\\text{NaCl}$ was insufficient to initiate the \"salting-out\" process in the smaller volume.\nB. The total water content, which includes a substantial, non-scalable amount initially miscible with acetonitrile, was not adequately reduced by the proportionally scaled amount of $\\text{MgSO}_4$.\nC. The 5.0 mL of acetonitrile used was below a critical absolute volume required to form a stable phase, regardless of the salt concentration.\nD. Proportional scaling caused the pH of the mixture to shift outside the optimal range for phase separation.\nE. The heat of hydration from the 2.0 g of $\\text{MgSO}_4$ was insufficient to raise the system temperature, a condition which is necessary for phase separation to occur.", "solution": "We begin by formalizing the compositions and the physical chemistry of the system.\n\nThe sample is a fruit with water mass fraction $f=0.85$. Thus, for a sample mass $m_{s}$, the water mass is\n$$\nm_{w}=f\\,m_{s}.\n$$\nIn the established protocol: $m_{s}=10.0$ g gives $m_{w}=0.85\\times 10.0$ g $=8.5$ g, mixed with $V_{a}=10.0$ mL of acetonitrile and salts $m_{\\text{MgSO}_{4}}=4.0$ g and $m_{\\text{NaCl}}=1.0$ g. In the scaled trial: $m_{s}=5.0$ g gives $m_{w}=0.85\\times 5.0$ g $=4.25$ g, mixed with $V_{a}=5.0$ mL of acetonitrile and salts $m_{\\text{MgSO}_{4}}=2.0$ g and $m_{\\text{NaCl}}=0.5$ g.\n\nKey physical and chemical principles:\n\n1) Miscibility and salting out. Acetonitrile and water are fully miscible without salt, so before salt addition there is a single phase. Adding electrolyte raises the aqueous activity coefficient of acetonitrile and reduces mutual solubility, creating a two-phase region in the ternary diagram acetonitrile–water–salt. Whether phase separation occurs depends on the overall composition crossing the binodal, i.e., it is governed by composition, not by absolute volume.\n\n2) Role of salts. Both $\\text{NaCl}$ and $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$ contribute to the salting-out effect (electrolyte strength). In addition, anhydrous $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$ acts as a drying agent by forming hydrates, thereby removing water from the organic-rich phase. The drying capacity is stoichiometrically limited:\n$$\nn_{w,\\text{bound}}\\leq \\nu\\,n_{\\text{MgSO}_{4}},\n$$\nwith $\\nu$ the hydration number (up to $7$ for $\\text{MgSO}_{4}\\cdot 7\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$) and $n_{\\text{MgSO}_{4}}$ the moles of anhydrous $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$. This water binding effectively reduces the free water that would otherwise remain miscible with acetonitrile and inhibits formation of an acetonitrile-rich phase unless enough water is sequestered.\n\n3) Threshold to cross the binodal. From the initial single-phase point, there exists a minimum absolute water removal, call it $\\Delta n_{w}^{\\ast}$, required to move the overall composition into the two-phase region and to establish an acetonitrile-rich layer that is sufficiently dehydrated. If $n_{w,\\text{bound}}<\\Delta n_{w}^{\\ast}$, the system remains as a single phase (or an emulsion without a clear upper layer).\n\nNow, analyze the options in light of these principles:\n\n- Option A claims that $\\text{NaCl}$ alone was insufficient to initiate salting out. However, salting out is a function of total ionic strength; both salts contribute, and the composition was scaled proportionally, so the ionic strength relative to water is preserved. There is no basis that $\\text{NaCl}$ specifically, and only in the smaller volume, becomes uniquely insufficient when the overall composition is unchanged. Therefore A does not best explain the failure.\n\n- Option C proposes a critical absolute acetonitrile volume regardless of salt. Thermodynamically, phase separation is composition-driven; there is no intrinsic absolute-volume threshold for forming two phases. While small volumes can be more prone to emulsions kinetically, the statement claims independence from salt concentration, which is not physically correct for salting out. Therefore C is not the best explanation.\n\n- Option D invokes pH shifts from proportional scaling. With only $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$ and $\\text{NaCl}$ used (no buffering citrate salts mentioned), pH is neither expected to shift from proportional scaling nor is pH the controlling factor for acetonitrile–water phase separation. Thus D is not appropriate.\n\n- Option E asserts that the heat of hydration must raise temperature for phase separation. QuEChERS salting out does not require a temperature rise; phase separation is driven by salt-induced activity changes and by water sequestration, not by endothermic or exothermic effects. Hence E is incorrect.\n\n- Option B focuses on the drying role of $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$ and the necessity to remove enough water that is initially entirely miscible with acetonitrile. Because $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$ has a finite, stoichiometric hydration capacity, the amount of water that must be removed to cross into the two-phase region, $\\Delta n_{w}^{\\ast}$, acts as an absolute requirement from the initial single-phase composition. Proportional scaling reduces $n_{\\text{MgSO}_{4}}$ and thus $n_{w,\\text{bound}}$ in direct proportion, but nonidealities (matrix water release into the acetonitrile-rich microenvironment, water already present in acetonitrile, and the need to leave the aqueous phase at high ionic strength) can make $\\Delta n_{w}^{\\ast}$ effectively non-negligible at small scale. If the scaled $n_{w,\\text{bound}}$ falls below $\\Delta n_{w}^{\\ast}$, the composition does not cross the binodal, and no distinct acetonitrile layer forms. This matches the observation and correctly emphasizes the primary chemical function of $\\text{MgSO}_{4}$ in QuEChERS: to remove water sufficiently to allow an acetonitrile-rich phase to separate. Therefore B provides the best physical and chemical explanation among the choices.\n\nConclusion: B is the best answer, because it correctly attributes the failure to insufficient dehydration capacity relative to the water that is initially miscible with acetonitrile, a critical requirement for salting-out driven phase separation in QuEChERS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1483078"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of any quantitative analysis is to determine the concentration of an analyte in the original, unprocessed sample.
