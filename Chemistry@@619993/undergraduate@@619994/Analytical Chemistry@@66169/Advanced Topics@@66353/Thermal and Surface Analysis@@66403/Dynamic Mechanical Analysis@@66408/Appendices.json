In the experiment, a rectangular sample of the polymer is subjected to a small, oscillating sinusoidal strain at a fixed frequency. The temperature of the sample is slowly ramped up from a low temperature, where the polymer is rigid and glassy, to a high temperature, where it becomes soft and rubbery.\n\nThe instrument records two primary variables as a function of temperature:\n- **Variable M1**: This variable is defined as the component of the resulting stress that is perfectly in-phase with the applied strain, divided by the strain amplitude. Physically, it relates to the elastic character and stiffness of the material.\n- **Variable M2**: This variable is defined as the component of the resulting stress that is 90 degrees out-of-phase with the applied strain, divided by the strain amplitude. Physically, it relates to the viscous character and energy-dissipating properties of the material.\n\nThe experimental data shows the following behavior for the two variables across the temperature scan:\n- At low temperatures, Variable M1 has a high, stable value. As the temperature increases through a narrow, characteristic range, the value of M1 drops sharply by several orders of magnitude. At temperatures above this range, M1 remains at a new, much lower stable value.\n- At low temperatures, Variable M2 has a very low value. As the temperature enters the same characteristic range where M1 drops, Variable M2 rises to a distinct peak and then decreases as the temperature is further increased.\n\nBased on these definitions and observed behaviors, identify Variable M1 and Variable M2.\n\nA.

The loss tangent is $\\tan\\delta=\\frac{E''}{E'}$, which is not the same as the out-of-phase stress component divided by the strain amplitude.\n\nAs temperature increases through the glass transition:\n- $E'$ is high and approximately constant in the glassy region, drops sharply by orders of magnitude through the transition, and reaches a lower rubbery plateau, matching the observed behavior for M1.\n- $E''$ is small at low temperature, exhibits a peak near the glass transition (the primary $\\alpha$ relaxation), then decreases at higher temperatures, matching the observed behavior for M2.\n\nThus, the variable identifications are M1 as $E'$ and M2 as $E''$, corresponding to option B. Options A and C misassign the in-phase and out-of-phase definitions; option E assigns M2 as $\\tan\\delta$, which, though it often peaks near the transition, is not defined as the out-of-phase stress component divided by strain amplitude; option D is unrelated to DMA linear viscoelastic moduli.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1437994"}, {"introduction": "Once you can distinguish the storage and loss moduli, the next step is to extract quantitative parameters from the data.
