The 4-mercaptopyridine molecule possesses two potential binding sites: the sulfur atom of the thiol group and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring. To determine the dominant binding mode and molecular orientation, three separate SERS experiments are conducted.\n\nThe molecule in its free, unbound state exhibits a characteristic C-S stretching vibration at $695~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and a prominent symmetric pyridine ring breathing mode at $991~\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe experimental observations from the SERS spectra are as follows:\n\n1.  **Unlabeled 4-mercaptopyridine:** When adsorbed on the silver nanoparticles, the C-S stretching vibration at $695~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ disappears completely. A new, intense peak appears at $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The symmetric ring breathing mode shifts to $1096~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ and is significantly enhanced.\n\n2.  **$^{15}$N-substituted 4-mercaptopyridine:** In this experiment, the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring is an $^{15}\\text{N}$ isotope (atomic mass ~15 amu) instead of the natural $^{14}\\text{N}$ (atomic mass ~14 amu). The SERS spectrum shows the prominent ring breathing mode at $1084~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The peak at $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ remains unshifted.\n\n3.  **$^{34}$S-substituted 4-mercaptopyridine:** Here, the sulfur atom is a $^{34}\\text{S}$ isotope (atomic mass ~34 amu) instead of the natural $^{32}\\text{S}$ (atomic mass ~32 amu). The SERS spectrum shows the ring breathing mode at $1096~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The peak at $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ shifts down to $236~\\text{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the most likely binding site and orientation of the 4-mercaptopyridine molecule on the silver surface?\n\nA. Binding occurs via the nitrogen atom, with the molecular axis oriented perpendicular to the silver surface.\n\nB. The molecule physisorbs and lies flat on the surface, with the pyridine ring plane parallel to the silver surface.\n\nC. Binding occurs via the sulfur atom, with the molecular axis oriented perpendicular to the silver surface.\n\nD. Binding occurs simultaneously through both the sulfur and nitrogen atoms to different silver atoms on the surface.\n\nE. Binding occurs via the nitrogen atom, with the pyridine ring plane oriented parallel to the silver surface.", "solution": "We identify the key spectroscopic signatures and apply vibrational frequency–mass relations and the SERS surface selection rule to determine both the binding site and the orientation.\n\n1) Appearance of the low-frequency mode and disappearance of the C–S stretch upon adsorption:\n- In the free molecule, the C–S stretching vibration appears at $695~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Upon adsorption, this band vanishes and a new intense band appears at $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Formation of a metal–sulfur bond upon chemisorption typically produces a metal–sulfur stretching band in the $200-300~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ region and strongly perturbs the C–S bond; the disappearance of the free-molecule C–S stretch alongside the emergence of a new band at $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ is therefore consistent with formation of an Ag–S bond.\n- Thus, the unlabeled spectrum suggests binding via sulfur, producing an Ag–S stretch.\n\n2) Isotopic substitution and the diatomic-oscillator frequency law:\n- For a normal mode that can be approximated as a diatomic-like stretch, the vibrational wavenumber scales as\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the effective force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the vibrating pair. For a metal–X stretch, $\\mu = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Ag}} m_{X}}{m_{\\mathrm{Ag}} + m_{X}}$ with $X$ the ligand atom involved in the bond.\n- $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ substitution: The ring breathing mode shifts from $1096~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ to $1084~\\text{cm}^{-1}$, consistent with increased mass in the ring contributing to the mode ($\\mu$ increases, so $\\tilde{\\nu}$ decreases). The $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ peak remains unshifted, which rules out an Ag–N assignment for this low-frequency mode because, for an Ag–N stretch, replacing $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ by $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ would increase $\\mu$ and decrease the wavenumber.\n- $^{34}\\mathrm{S}$ substitution: The ring breathing remains at $1096~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ (no ring mass change at N), whereas the $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ peak shifts down to $236~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. This is exactly the behavior expected for an Ag–S stretch: increasing $m_{\\mathrm{S}}$ increases $\\mu$ and decreases $\\tilde{\\nu}$.\n- Therefore, the low-frequency mode is an Ag–S stretch, and there is no evidence for an Ag–N stretch. Binding is via sulfur, not nitrogen.\n\n3) Orientation from the SERS surface selection rule:\n- The SERS surface selection rule for isotropic metals dictates that the intensity of a vibrational mode is dominated by the component of the Raman polarizability derivative along the surface normal:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{SERS}} \\propto \\left|\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}' \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_{z}\\right|^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{e}_{z}$ is the unit vector normal to the surface and $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}'$ is the derivative of the polarizability tensor with respect to the normal coordinate of the mode.\n- The symmetric pyridine ring breathing mode (totally symmetric) is strongly enhanced and upshifted (from $991~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ to $1096~\\text{cm}^{-1}$), indicating strong chemisorptive coupling and that its polarizability change projects strongly onto the surface normal. For 4-mercaptopyridine bound through sulfur, the Ag–S bond is typically oriented close to the surface normal. Because the C–S bond lies in the plane of the pyridine ring, aligning the S–Ag bond along the surface normal constrains the ring plane to be approximately perpendicular to the surface. This “upright” geometry maximizes the normal component for many totally symmetric in-plane ring modes, thereby explaining their strong SERS enhancement.\n- A flat, physisorbed geometry would not produce the strong chemisorption marker at $238~\\text{cm}^{-1}$, and binding via nitrogen would produce an Ag–N stretch sensitive to $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ substitution, which is not observed. Simultaneous S and N binding would be expected to show signatures of both Ag–S and Ag–N and isotope sensitivity to both substitutions, which is not observed.\n\nConclusion: The data collectively require binding via sulfur to silver and an upright orientation with the molecular axis (through the C–S bond) perpendicular to the surface, which places the pyridine ring plane approximately perpendicular to the surface.

The success of the experiment critically depends on the choice of the plasmonic substrate.
