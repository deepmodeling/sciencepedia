The observation of a distinct mass loss between $90\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $130\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ implies that in this interval $\\Delta m<0$, which can only occur if a volatile species is leaving the solid, such as solvent, water of crystallization, or decomposition products.\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measures the heat flow associated with transitions, qualitatively reflecting the enthalpy change $\\Delta H$.

The coincidence of a broad endothermic feature with a mass loss under an inert $\\text{N}_2$ atmosphere constrains the mechanism to processes where heat is absorbed while a volatile species is released.\n\nEvaluate the options against these constraints:\n- Melting (A) is endothermic ($\\Delta H>0$) but does not involve mass loss, so it would show $\\Delta m=0$ on TGA. This contradicts the observed $\\Delta m<0$.\n- Glass transition (B) is not a first-order transition; it manifests as a step change in heat capacity without a latent heat peak and without mass change, so it would produce no endothermic peak and $\\Delta m=0$. This contradicts both observations.\n- Crystallization from an amorphous state (C) is exothermic ($\\Delta H<0$) and does not involve mass loss ($\\Delta m=0$). This contradicts both the endothermic DSC signal and the TGA mass loss.\n- Dehydration of a hydrate (D) involves release of water vapor, giving $\\Delta m<0$, and is typically endothermic due to breaking of hydrogen bonds and lattice stabilization, giving $\\Delta H>0$. The temperature range $90$ to $130\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ is common for loss of water of crystallization in pharmaceutical hydrates, and the inert $\\text{N}_2$ atmosphere is consistent with an intramolecular or lattice solvent loss process rather than oxidative chemistry.\n- Solid-state oxidation (E) generally requires oxygen; under $\\text{N}_2$ it is suppressed.
