The technique involves bombarding the surface with high-energy electrons, which causes the ejection of core-level electrons from the atoms in the sample. The resulting core-hole is then filled by an electron from a higher energy level, and the energy released in this transition is transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom. This ejected electron is known as an Auger electron, and its kinetic energy is characteristic of the parent atom.\n\nFor a specific Auger process in a copper atom, a core-hole is created in the $L_3$ shell. An electron from the $M_2$ shell fills this hole, and the energy is transferred to an electron in the $M_4$ shell, which is then ejected. The binding energies of the electrons in these shells for a neutral copper atom are given as:\n- Binding energy of the $L_3$ shell, $E_{B}(L_3) = 932.7$ eV.\n- Binding energy of the $M_2$ shell, $E_{B}(M_2) = 77.3$ eV.\n- Binding energy of the $M_4$ shell, $E_{B}(M_4) = 3.6$ eV.\n\nUsing a simplified model that neglects the change in electron binding energies in the ionized atom, calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected $L_3 M_2 M_4$ Auger electron.
