This exercise challenges you to think critically about the fundamental principles of two common thermal analysis techniques: Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). By considering a specific physical change—a polymorphic transition—you will explore what each technique is designed to measure, and why they provide complementary, not redundant, information about a material [@problem_id:1437243].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with characterizing a newly synthesized crystalline organic compound, designated \"Compound Z\". Preliminary studies suggest that at a temperature of approximately 150 °C, Compound Z undergoes a polymorphic transition, converting from its stable room-temperature form (Form α) to a different crystalline form (Form β). This process is known to be endothermic. The compound does not decompose or sublime at this temperature. To confirm this behavior, the chemist performs two separate analyses on a sample of Compound Z, heating it at a constant rate from 25 °C to 200 °C.\n\nThe first analysis is Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), which measures the mass of the sample as a function of temperature. The second is Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), which measures the temperature difference ($\\Delta T$) between the sample and an inert reference material as both are subjected to the same heating program. In DTA, an endothermic process in the sample results in a negative $\\Delta T$, conventionally plotted as a downward peak, while an exothermic process results in a positive $\\Delta T$, plotted as an upward peak.\n\nWhich of the following options most accurately describes the expected instrumental output from the TGA and DTA experiments in the temperature region around 150 °C?\n\nA. The TGA curve will show a sharp, step-wise decrease in mass, and the DTA curve will show a distinct downward peak.\n\nB.

A polymorphic transition is a solid-state rearrangement of the crystal lattice without any change in chemical composition or release/uptake of volatile species. The problem states that the compound does not decompose or sublime at the transition temperature, and the process is only a polymorphic transition. Therefore, there is no mass loss or gain at the transition. The governing statement is that the mass change across the transition is zero:\n$$\n\\Delta m = 0,\n$$\nso the TGA trace $m(T)$ remains essentially constant through the transition region (neglecting instrumental baseline drift). Hence, no sharp step-wise decrease in mass is expected around $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFor DTA: DTA measures the temperature difference between the sample and an inert reference under the same programmed heating, $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{sample}} - T_{\\text{reference}}$. During an endothermic event in the sample, heat is absorbed by the sample; under the same external heating rate, the sample temperature lags behind the reference, giving\n$$\n\\Delta T < 0,\n$$\nwhich, by the sign convention specified in the problem, appears as a downward peak on the DTA curve at the transition temperature. A polymorphic transition with positive enthalpy change (endothermic) thus produces a distinct downward DTA peak near $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because it predicts a TGA mass loss that is not consistent with $\\Delta m = 0$ for a solid–solid polymorphic transition without sublimation or decomposition, although it correctly predicts a downward DTA peak.\n- B is incorrect because it predicts an upward DTA peak, which would correspond to an exothermic process, contrary to the stated endothermic nature.\n- C is correct: the TGA curve remains essentially flat (no mass change), and the DTA shows a distinct downward peak (endothermic, $\\Delta T < 0$).\n- D is incorrect because it predicts a mass loss on TGA and no DTA peak, both inconsistent with the described endothermic transition.\n\nTherefore, the expected outputs are a flat TGA trace and a downward DTA peak near $150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1437243"}, {"introduction": "Real-world materials rarely undergo just a single, simple change upon heating. This practice moves beyond isolated events to the interpretation of a more complex thermogram, where a substance undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal processes. By analyzing a hypothetical DTA curve featuring both a sharp, endothermic dip and a broad, exothermic peak, you will learn to decipher the story of a material's transformation and connect peak characteristics like direction and shape to specific physical and chemical events like melting and decomposition [@problem_id:1437256].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is studying a newly synthesized organic compound using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). In the experiment, a small amount of the compound (the sample) and an equal mass of a thermally inert reference material (e.g., alumina, $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$) are placed in a furnace and heated at a constant, controlled rate. The instrument records the temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{sample}} - T_{\\text{reference}}$, as a function of the furnace temperature, $T$.\n\nThe resulting DTA thermogram shows the following features:\n1.  Starting from room temperature, $\\Delta T$ remains close to zero.\n2.  At a furnace temperature of $T_1$, the trace exhibits a sharp, negative dip, after which it returns to the baseline value of near zero.\n3.  As the furnace temperature continues to increase, the trace shows a broad, positive peak centered at a temperature $T_2$, where $T_2 > T_1$. After this peak, the signal again returns to the baseline.\n\nWhich of the following sequences of physical or chemical changes is the most plausible explanation for the observed thermogram?\n\nA.

Under identical furnace heating, this extra absorption causes the sample to lag in temperature relative to the inert reference, giving $T_{\\text{sample}} < T_{\\text{reference}}$, hence $\\Delta T < 0$ and a negative deflection.\n- During an exothermic event in the sample (e.g., crystallization, exothermic decomposition, curing), the sample releases heat, making $T_{\\text{sample}} > T_{\\text{reference}}$, hence $\\Delta T > 0$ and a positive deflection.\n\nInterpretation of feature at $T_{1}$:\n- The trace exhibits a sharp, negative dip at $T_{1}$, then returns to baseline. A sharp peak at a well-defined temperature with negative sign is characteristic of a first-order endothermic transition with latent heat, most plausibly melting. Melting typically appears as a narrow, well-defined endothermic peak because it occurs at a specific equilibrium temperature $T_{m}$ under quasi-equilibrium conditions.\n- A glass transition would not produce a sharp peak nor a distinct negative dip; it has no latent heat and manifests as a baseline shift due to a change in heat capacity $C_{p}$ rather than a peak. Therefore, a sharp negative dip at $T_{1}$ is inconsistent with a glass transition.\n\nInterpretation of feature at $T_{2} > T_{1}$:\n- The broad, positive peak centered at $T_{2}$ indicates an exothermic process distributed over a temperature range, which is typical of kinetically controlled processes such as exothermic decomposition or cold crystallization of an amorphous material. Since the signal returns to baseline after the peak, it corresponds to a discrete exothermic event that completes over that interval.\n- If it were endothermic decomposition, the sign would be negative, contradicting the observed positive peak. Boiling (vaporization) is endothermic and would also produce a negative feature, not positive.\n\nConsistency check of given options:\n- Option A (melting at $T_{1}$, then endothermic decomposition at $T_{2}$) predicts a negative peak at $T_{2}$, inconsistent with the observed positive broad peak.\n- Option B (glass transition at $T_{1}$, then crystallization at $T_{2}$) misassigns the first feature: a glass transition does not produce a sharp negative dip; moreover, while crystallization is exothermic and could give a broad positive peak, the $T_{1}$ feature is incompatible with $T_{g}$.\n- Option C (melting at $T_{1}$, then exothermic decomposition at $T_{2}$) matches both the sharp negative peak at $T_{1}$ (melting, endothermic) and the broad positive peak at $T_{2}$ (exothermic decomposition), and is physically plausible for an organic compound.\n- Option D (exothermic reaction at $T_{1}$, then boiling at $T_{2}$) predicts a positive peak at $T_{1}$ and a negative peak at $T_{2}$, both opposite to observations.\n- Option E (crystallization at $T_{1}$, then melting at $T_{2}$) would give a positive peak at $T_{1}$ (exothermic) and a negative peak at $T_{2}$ (endothermic), inconsistent with the signs observed.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible sequence matching the observed sharp negative dip at $T_{1}$ and broad positive peak at $T_{2}$ is melting followed by an exothermic decomposition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1437256"}, {"introduction": "Differential Thermal Analysis is not just a qualitative tool; it provides valuable quantitative insights into material properties.
