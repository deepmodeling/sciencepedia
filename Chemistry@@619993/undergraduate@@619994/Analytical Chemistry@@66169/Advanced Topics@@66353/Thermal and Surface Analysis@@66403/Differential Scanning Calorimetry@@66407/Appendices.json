The key quality metric is the degree of cure, which quantifies how far the cross-linking reaction has proceeded.

In the context of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of an exothermic curing reaction, the total enthalpy change for the complete reaction of a given mass of material is a constant.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the amount of heat released during a DSC scan is proportional to the amount of unreacted material present in the sample. The degree of cure can be calculated using the following relationship:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{total}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{residual}}}{\\Delta H_{\\text{total}}} = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{residual}}}{\\Delta H_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\text{total}}$ is the total enthalpy of reaction for a fully unreacted sample and $\\Delta H_{\\text{residual}}$ is the residual enthalpy measured from a partially cured sample.\n\nFor this comparison to be valid, the enthalpy values must be normalized by mass to obtain the specific enthalpy (enthalpy per unit mass), as the two samples have different masses.
