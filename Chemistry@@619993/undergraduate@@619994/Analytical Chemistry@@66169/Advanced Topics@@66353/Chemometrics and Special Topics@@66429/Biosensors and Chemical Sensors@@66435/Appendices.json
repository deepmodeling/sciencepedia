To characterize the sensor's performance, the chemist performs a series of measurements. First, to establish the baseline signal and its noise, the sensor's response is measured five times in a blank solution, which is known to contain zero Contaminant X. The measured signals are: 0.052 V, 0.048 V, 0.055 V, 0.047 V, and 0.053 V.\n\nNext, a calibration curve is prepared by measuring the sensor's signal for five different standard solutions of Contaminant X at low concentrations. The data are as follows:\n\n| Concentration ($\\mu$M) | Signal (V) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 1.0 | 0.153 |\n| 2.0 | 0.249 |\n| 5.0 | 0.555 |\n| 8.0 | 0.848 |\n| 10.0 | 1.055 |\n\nThe relationship between signal ($S$) and concentration ($C$) in this range is assumed to be linear, following the equation $S = mC + b$, where $m$ is the sensitivity and $b$ is the signal intercept.

The formula for the LOD is given as $LOD = \\frac{3 s_{blank}}{m}$, where $s_{blank}$ is the standard deviation of the blank measurements and $m$ is the slope (sensitivity) of the calibration curve. The solution involves three main steps: 1) calculating the statistics for the blank signal, 2) determining the slope of the calibration curve using linear regression, and 3) substituting these values into the LOD formula.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of the five blank signal measurements: 0.052 V, 0.048 V, 0.055 V, 0.047 V, and 0.053 V.\n\nThe mean of the blank signal, $\\bar{S}_{blank}$, is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements, $N=5$.\n$$ \\bar{S}_{blank} = \\frac{0.052 + 0.048 + 0.055 + 0.047 + 0.053}{5} = \\frac{0.255}{5} = 0.051 \\text{ V} $$\n\nThe standard deviation of the blank signal, $s_{blank}$, is calculated using the formula $s_{blank} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(S_i - \\bar{S}_{blank})^2}{N-1}}$.\nThe squared deviations from the mean are:\n$(0.052 - 0.051)^2 = (0.001)^2 = 0.000001$\n$(0.048 - 0.051)^2 = (-0.003)^2 = 0.000009$\n$(0.055 - 0.051)^2 = (0.004)^2 = 0.000016$\n$(0.047 - 0.051)^2 = (-0.004)^2 = 0.000016$\n$(0.053 - 0.051)^2 = (0.002)^2 = 0.000004$\n\nThe sum of the squared deviations is $0.000001 + 0.000009 + 0.000016 + 0.000016 + 0.000004 = 0.000046$.\nThus, the standard deviation is:\n$$ s_{blank} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.000046}{5-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.000046}{4}} = \\sqrt{0.0000115} \\approx 0.00339116 \\text{ V} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the slope, $m$, of the calibration curve using the provided standard concentration ($C$) and signal ($S$) data.
