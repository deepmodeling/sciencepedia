Arsenic in the water is present primarily as arsenite, As(III), and arsenate, As(V). The chemist performs two separate measurements on identical aliquots of the sample.\n\n**Measurement A (for Total Arsenic):** An aliquot of the water sample is acidified with hydrochloric acid. A solution of potassium iodide (KI) and ascorbic acid is added as a pre-reduction agent, and the mixture is allowed to react for 30 minutes. Subsequently, a solution of sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$) is introduced, which reacts to produce volatile arsine gas ($\\text{AsH}_3$). This gas is then swept into the spectrometer for quantification.\n\n**Measurement B (for Arsenite):** A second aliquot of the water sample is acidified with hydrochloric acid. Without any pre-reduction step, the solution is immediately treated with sodium borohydride ($\\text{NaBH}_4$) to generate arsine gas, which is quantified in the same manner as in Measurement A.\n\nThe result from Measurement A corresponds to the total arsenic concentration, while the result from Measurement B is assumed to correspond to the concentration of arsenite, As(III), only. The concentration of arsenate, As(V), is then determined by the difference between these two measurements.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the chemical principle behind this analytical strategy?\n\nA. The KI/ascorbic acid mixture is added in Measurement A to precipitate interfering metal ions, while Measurement B is faster but less accurate due to these interferences.\n\nB. In Measurement A, the KI/ascorbic acid mixture directly reduces both As(III) and As(V) to volatile arsine (AsH$_3$), which is a more efficient process than using NaBH$_4$ alone.\n\nC. The KI/ascorbic acid mixture acts as a catalyst to speed up the slow reaction between As(V) and sodium borohydride in Measurement A, while in Measurement B this reaction is allowed to proceed slowly to selectively measure As(III).\n\nD. The purpose of the KI/ascorbic acid in Measurement A is to chemically reduce As(V) to As(III). This ensures that all arsenic species are in the As(III) state, which rapidly forms arsine gas with NaBH$_4$. Measurement B omits this step to selectively measure only the original As(III) content.\n\nE. The KI/ascorbic acid mixture in Measurement A converts As(III) to As(V), as As(V) produces a stronger signal in the AAS. Measurement B is performed to correct for the initial As(III) concentration.", "solution": "The problem requires an understanding of the chemical principles underlying the speciation analysis of arsenic using Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (HG-AAS). The core of the method relies on converting arsenic into a volatile form, arsine gas (AsH$_3$), for detection. The key to differentiating between the arsenic species, arsenite As(III) and arsenate As(V), lies in their different reactivities.\n\nFirst, let's consider the reaction that generates the detected substance, arsine gas. This is achieved by reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH$_4$) in an acidic medium. The crucial point is the kinetics of this reduction for the two different oxidation states of arsenic.\nThe reduction of As(III) to AsH$_3$ is rapid:\n$$ \\text{As(III)} + \\text{BH}_4^- \\xrightarrow{\\text{fast}} \\text{AsH}_3 $$\nIn contrast, the reduction of As(V) to AsH$_3$ using NaBH$_4$ is kinetically very slow and can be considered negligible during the short time frame of an analytical measurement.\n$$ \\text{As(V)} + \\text{BH}_4^- \\xrightarrow{\\text{very slow}} \\text{AsH}_3 $$\n\nNow, we can analyze the two measurements described.\n\nIn **Measurement B**, the acidified sample is treated directly with NaBH$_4$. Because only the reaction with As(III) is fast, the amount of AsH$_3$ generated and measured corresponds almost exclusively to the amount of As(III) originally present in the sample. Thus, Measurement B provides the concentration of arsenite, [As(III)].\n\nIn **Measurement A**, an additional \"pre-reduction\" step is performed before the addition of NaBH$_4$. The sample is treated with potassium iodide (KI) and ascorbic acid. The purpose of this step is to convert the kinetically unreactive As(V) into the reactive As(III) form. The iodide ion (I$^-$) from KI acts as the reducing agent in this step:\n$$ \\text{H}_3\\text{AsO}_4 (\\text{As(V)}) + 2\\text{I}^- + 2\\text{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_3\\text{AsO}_3 (\\text{As(III)}) + \\text{I}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\nAscorbic acid is typically added to reduce the iodine (I$_2$) produced back to iodide (I$^-$), which drives the equilibrium to the right, ensuring a complete and quantitative conversion of As(V) to As(III). After this pre-reduction step, virtually all arsenic in the sample—both the original As(III) and the As(III) formed from the reduction of As(V)—is present in the As(III) oxidation state. When NaBH$_4$ is subsequently added, all of this As(III) is rapidly converted to AsH$_3$ and measured. Therefore, the signal from Measurement A corresponds to the total arsenic concentration, [As(total)] = [As(III)] + [As(V)].\n\nThe speciation is completed by subtraction: [As(V)] = [As(total)] - [As(III)].\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this analysis:\n- A is incorrect. The primary role of KI is not to remove interferences by precipitation but to act as a reducing agent for As(V).\n- B is incorrect. The KI/ascorbic acid mixture does not generate arsine gas; it reduces As(V) to As(III). The subsequent addition of NaBH$_4$ is what generates the AsH$_3$.\n- C is incorrect. KI is a stoichiometric reactant (a reductant), not a catalyst. It is consumed in the reaction of reducing As(V).\n- D is correct. This statement accurately describes the entire process: KI/ascorbic acid reduces As(V) to As(III) so that all arsenic is in the reactive As(III) form for total arsenic measurement. Omitting this step allows for the selective measurement of the original As(III) due to the kinetic differences in hydride generation.\n- E is incorrect. This statement proposes the opposite reaction (oxidation of As(III) to As(V)) and incorrectly claims As(V) gives a stronger signal. The method relies on the rapid signal generation from As(III).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1474707"}, {"introduction": "Accurate speciation analysis begins long before the sample reaches the instrument; it starts with proper sample collection and preservation.
