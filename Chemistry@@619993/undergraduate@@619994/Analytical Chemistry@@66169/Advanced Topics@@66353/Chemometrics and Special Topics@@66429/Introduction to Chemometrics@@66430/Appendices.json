While visual inspection is useful, a quantitative measure is essential for objective decision-making.

This practice will guide you through the calculation of $r$ for two simplified spectra, providing a concrete understanding of how we can numerically assess chemical identity [@problem_id:1450484].", "problem": "In a quality control laboratory, an analytical chemist is tasked with verifying the identity of a new batch of a drug substance. The primary analytical method used is ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry.

For a simplified comparison, the absorbance values are recorded at four specific, identical wavelengths for both the reference standard (Spectrum A) and the new batch (Spectrum B). The data are as follows:\n\nFor the reference standard (Spectrum A), the absorbance values are 0.20, 0.50, 0.80, and 0.40.\n\nFor the new batch (Spectrum B), the corresponding absorbance values at the same wavelengths are 0.25, 0.58, 0.85, and 0.47.\n\nTo quantitatively assess the similarity between the two spectra, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$.
