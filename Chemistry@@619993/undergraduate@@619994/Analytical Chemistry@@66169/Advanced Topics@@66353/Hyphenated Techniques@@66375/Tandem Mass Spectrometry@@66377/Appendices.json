The first stage of the experiment involves electrospray ionization, creating ions of the peptide. In the first mass analyzer (MS1), the chemist isolates the singly-charged protonated molecule, represented as $[M+H]^+$, which shows a prominent peak at a mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of 492.3.\n\nThis isolated precursor ion is then directed into a collision cell filled with an inert gas, where it undergoes Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID). The resulting product ions (or fragment ions) are then analyzed in the second mass analyzer (MS2) to generate a product ion spectrum.\n\nUpon reviewing the MS2 spectrum, a trainee reports observing a distinct, reproducible peak at an $m/z$ of 514.3. Assuming the mass spectrometer is perfectly calibrated and functioning correctly, which of the following statements provides the most scientifically valid explanation for this observation in the context of a CID experiment?\n\nA. The precursor ion, during its transit through the collision cell, reacted with a molecule of nitrogen ($N_2$, molecular weight approx. 28 u) from a minor air leak, forming a new, heavier adduct.\n\nB. The observation is fundamentally impossible under the principles of mass conservation applied to fragmentation. The peak at $m/z$ 514.3 cannot be a fragment of the precursor at $m/z$ 492.3, and must therefore originate from a different source, such as a co-isolated contaminant ion that was not fully filtered out by the first mass analyzer.\n\nC. The high-energy collision in the CID cell induced an intramolecular rearrangement that created a more stable, isomerized ion with a higher mass.\n\nD. The precursor ion did not fragment but instead picked up a sodium ion ($Na^+$, atomic weight approx. 23 u) that was present as an impurity, forming an $[M+H+Na]^{2+}$ ion.\n\nE. The isolated precursor ion was actually a doubly-charged ion, $[M+2H]^{2+}$, misidentified as singly-charged. The peak at 514.3 corresponds to the true singly-charged molecule, $[M+H]^+$.", "solution": "Define the neutral peptide mass as $M$. For a singly charged protonated precursor, the observed mass-to-charge is\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z}\\left([M+H]^{+}\\right)=\\frac{M+m_{H}}{1}=M+m_{H}.\n$$\nIn CID, collisions with an inert, neutral gas deposit internal energy that induces bond cleavages. The fundamental constraints are mass conservation and charge conservation. For a singly charged precursor, any product ion that is detected must carry $z\\geq 1$, and its mass must be drawn from the original $M+m_{H}$ (with the remainder ejected as neutrals). Therefore, for any fragment ion produced purely by CID of $[M+H]^{+}$,\n$$\nm_{\\text{frag}} \\leq M+m_{H},\n$$\nwith equality only if no fragmentation occurs (i.e., the surviving precursor). Consequently, for $z=1$, no CID fragment can have $\\frac{m}{z}>M+m_{H}$; a peak at higher $m/z$ than the precursor cannot arise from fragmentation of that precursor.\n\nEvaluate each option under these constraints:\n\n- A: An adduct with $N_{2}$ would require association with a neutral collision partner inside the CID cell. CID conditions promote dissociation, not association, and $N_{2}$ is chemically inert. Moreover, such an adduct would appear at $M+m_{H}+m_{N_{2}}$, implying a shift by $m_{N_{2}}$, which does not match the reported shift. This is not a scientifically valid explanation for a reproducible CID product ion.\n\n- B: Since $\\frac{m}{z}=514.3>M+m_{H}$ for the isolated precursor at $\\frac{m}{z}=492.3$, the 514.3 peak cannot be a fragment of that precursor under CID. The most consistent explanation is that the signal arises from a different ion (e.g., a co-isolated contaminant or adduct such as $[M+Na]^{+}$) that was not fully excluded by MS1 and appears in MS2 (either as a surviving ion or its own product).\n\n- C: Intramolecular rearrangement conserves mass; it cannot produce a higher-mass ion from the same precursor without adding mass from an external species. Thus it cannot explain a peak at higher $m/z$.\n\n- D: If a sodium ion were added to form a dication, the observed mass-to-charge would be\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z}\\left([M+H+Na]^{2+}\\right)=\\frac{M+m_{H}+m_{Na}}{2}.\n$$\nBecause $M+m_{H}\\gg m_{Na}$ for a peptide, one has $\\frac{M+m_{H}+m_{Na}}{2}<M+m_{H}$, so this cannot yield a peak at higher $m/z$ than the singly charged precursor. Furthermore, the collision gas does not supply Na$^{+}$.\n\n- E: If $492.3$ were actually $\\frac{M+2m_{H}}{2}$ (a doubly charged precursor), then the true singly charged $[M+H]^{+}$ would be at $M+m_{H}\\approx 2\\times 492.3 - m_{H}$, which would be near twice the precursor $m/z$, not $514.3$.\n\nTherefore, the only scientifically valid explanation among the options is that the peak at $m/z$ $514.3$ is not a CID fragment of the isolated $[M+H]^{+}$ at $m/z$ $492.3$, but instead originates from a different ion that was not completely excluded in MS1 (co-isolation or contamination).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1479320"}]}
