The procedure involves digesting a known mass of soil to bring the Cadmium into an aqueous solution. The concentration of Cadmium in this solution is then determined using Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS). The natural isotopic abundances of Cadmium are known, and a calibrated spike solution, highly enriched in the isotope $^{111}\\text{Cd}$, is used.\n\nThe standard procedure is as follows:\n1. A precisely weighed aliquot of the aqueous soil digest is taken.\n2. A precisely known amount of the $^{111}\\text{Cd}$ spike solution is added to this aliquot.\n3. The mixture is thoroughly homogenized to ensure complete equilibration between the natural Cadmium and the spike.\n4. The isotopic ratio of two selected Cadmium isotopes (e.g., $^{111}\\text{Cd}$/ $^{114}\\text{Cd}$) in the mixture is measured using a mass spectrometer.\n5. The original amount of Cadmium in the aliquot is calculated from the measured isotopic ratio and the known quantities.\n\nDuring one such analysis, after taking the aliquot of the soil digest but *before* adding the isotopic spike, the chemist accidentally spills and loses a significant fraction of the aliquot.

Because the spill occurred before spiking, the mixture contains only $n_{s}=\\alpha n_{s,0}$ from the intended aliquot. The isotope-dilution calculation therefore returns $n_{s}=\\alpha n_{s,0}$, not $n_{s,0}$.\n\nIf the chemist (unaware of the loss) interprets the calculated $n_{s}$ as the amount in the originally taken aliquot, then the inferred Cadmium amount is low by the factor $\\alpha$. Any subsequent back-calculation to the original soil sample (via known dilution and aliquot factors recorded before the spill) will propagate this proportional deficit, yielding a systematic underestimate of the Cadmium mass in the original soil sample.\n\nBy contrast, losses occurring after spike addition would not bias the result because both isotopes are affected proportionally and the ratio $R_{m}$ remains unchanged; however, that condition does not apply here.
