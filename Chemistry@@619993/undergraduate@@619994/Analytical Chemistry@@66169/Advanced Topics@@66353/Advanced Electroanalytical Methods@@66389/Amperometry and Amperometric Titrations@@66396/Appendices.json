A constant potential is applied to a dropping mercury electrode, which is sufficient to reduce Pb$^{2+}$ but not the titrant species. The titrant is a standard solution of sodium sulfate, Na$_2$SO$_4$, which reacts with Pb$^{2+}$ to form a sparingly soluble precipitate, lead(II) sulfate (PbSO$_4$). During the titration, the diffusion-limited current is recorded as a function of the volume of titrant added.\n\nThe resulting titration curve, a plot of current versus volume of titrant, shows two distinct regions with approximately linear behavior. The first region shows a decreasing current as Pb$^{2+}$ is consumed. The second region, after the equivalence point, shows a nearly constant, low residual current. However, in the immediate vicinity of the equivalence point, the data points deviate from these two linear trends, creating a smooth, rounded transition between them.
