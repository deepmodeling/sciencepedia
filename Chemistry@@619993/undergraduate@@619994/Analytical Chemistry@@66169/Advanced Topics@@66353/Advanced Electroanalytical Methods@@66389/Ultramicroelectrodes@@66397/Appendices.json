The characteristic diffusion layer thickness over time $t$ is\n$$\n\\delta(t) \\sim \\sqrt{D t},\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient (assume equal $D$ for simplicity of shape arguments). The geometry of diffusion relative to the electrode radius $a$ determines the voltammetric response.\n\nScenario I (very slow scan; steady-state at a UME): The potential scan is slow such that at each potential the diffusion field reaches steady state. At a UME, steady-state is sustained by radial diffusion. The steady-state diffusion-limited current for a disk UME is independent of time and potential once fully mass-transport limited:\n$$\ni_{\\text{ss}} = 4 n F D C^{*} a,\n$$\nwhere $C^{*}$ is the bulk concentration and $a$ is the radius of the microdisk (the numerical prefactor is the classical steady-state result for a microdisk; the key feature is that $i_{\\text{ss}}$ is constant). Under a reversible CV, as the potential is swept through $E^{0'}$, the surface concentrations adjust Nernstianly, and the current transitions smoothly from one limiting branch to the other, approaching a constant diffusion-limited value. Therefore, the voltammogram displays a sigmoidal (S-shaped) $i$–$E$ curve with a steady-state limiting current plateau.\n\nScenario II (very fast scan; planar diffusion; no steady-state): When the scan is very fast, the characteristic timescale is short so that $\\delta(t) \\ll a$.

Following a potential perturbation, the transient current for planar diffusion follows the Cottrell scaling:\n$$\ni(t) \\sim n F A C^{*} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}},\n$$\nwith $A$ the electrode area. In cyclic voltammetry under reversible conditions with planar diffusion, the current exhibits a peak on the forward scan due to depletion and the time dependence of the diffusion layer. The reversible peak current scales as\n$$\ni_{p} \\propto n F A C^{*} D^{1/2} v^{1/2},\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the scan rate (Randles–Sevcik dependence), and the voltammogram is peak-shaped, akin to the response at a macroelectrode.
