The diffusion-limited current, $i_d$, is a key observable that is related to the analyte concentration. This current is also dependent on the physical characteristics of the DME, which are controlled by the height of the mercury reservoir.\n\nIn an initial measurement, the corrected height of the mercury column, denoted as $h_1$, is set to $81.0$ cm. This setup yields a stable, time-averaged diffusion current $i_{d,1} = 15.6$ µA. For a subsequent run, the experimental conditions are altered by lowering the mercury reservoir.

In its simplified form, the diffusion current is proportional to the product of the two-thirds power of the mercury mass flow rate, $m$, and the one-sixth power of the drop time, $t$. All other factors, including the diffusion coefficient of the analyte, its concentration, and the number of electrons transferred, can be grouped into a single proportionality constant, $K$, since they are held constant in this problem.\n\n$$i_d = K m^{2/3} t^{1/6}$$\n\nThe mass flow rate, $m$, is directly proportional to the corrected height of the mercury column, $h$. This is because the pressure driving the mercury flow through the capillary is proportional to this height (Poiseuille's law). We can write this relationship as:\n\n$$m \\propto h$$\n\nThe drop time, $t$, is the time required for a mercury drop to grow to a size where its weight overcomes the surface tension at the capillary tip. It is found experimentally and theoretically that the drop time is inversely proportional to the mass flow rate, and therefore inversely proportional to the height of the mercury column.\n\n$$t \\propto \\frac{1}{m} \\propto \\frac{1}{h}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these relationships for $m$ and $t$ back into the proportionality for the diffusion current, $i_d$:\n\n$$i_d \\propto (h)^{2/3} \\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right)^{1/6}$$\n\nCombining the terms involving $h$:\n\n$$i_d \\propto h^{2/3} h^{-1/6} = h^{(4/6 - 1/6)} = h^{1/2}$$\n\nThis shows that the diffusion current, $i_d$, is directly proportional to the square root of the corrected height of the mercury column, $h$.

The onset of the cadmium reduction causes a significant current contribution before the diffusion-limited plateau for lead is reached.\n\nTo overcome this, the chemist employs a simultaneous equation method. They measure the current at two fixed potentials for the sample mixture and for individual standard solutions of each ion. The two potentials are selected as $E_1 = -0.500$ V, which lies on the overlapping portion of the two waves, and $E_2 = -0.800$ V, which is on the final diffusion-limited plateau where both species are reduced at their maximum rate.
