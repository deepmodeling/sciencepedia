The area under each resonance signal is directly proportional to the number of protons giving rise to that signal, providing a ratio of the different types of protons within a molecule.

An organic chemist is analyzing the $^1$H NMR spectrum of a purified compound. By calibrating the instrument, the chemist sets the integral value for a signal corresponding to a methylene ($-\\text{CH}_2-$) group to be 4.70.

This splitting pattern provides valuable information about the connectivity of atoms in a molecule.\n\nConsider a proton, designated as $H_X$, within an unknown acyclic organic molecule. The signal for $H_X$ in the spectrum is observed as a complex multiplet described as a **triplet of quartets**. This pattern arises from coupling to two distinct sets of chemically non-equivalent neighboring protons. Which of the following describes the number of protons in these two neighboring sets?\n\nA. One set of 2 equivalent protons and another set of 4 equivalent protons.\n\nB. One set of 3 equivalent protons and another set of 4 equivalent protons.\n\nC.

If a proton $H_{X}$ couples to two non-equivalent sets of equivalent protons containing $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ protons, respectively, and the coupling constants are sufficiently different to be resolved, the observed pattern is a composite multiplet described as an $(n_{1}+1)$ of $(n_{2}+1)$, giving a total of $(n_{1}+1)(n_{2}+1)$ lines.\n\nA “triplet of quartets” means the signal is first split into $3$ lines (a triplet) by one set, and each of those lines is further split into $4$ lines (a quartet) by the other set. Therefore,\n$$\nn_{1}+1=3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_{1}=2,\n$$\n$$\nn_{2}+1=4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_{2}=3.\n$$\nThus, $H_{X}$ is coupled to one set of $2$ equivalent protons and another set of $3$ equivalent protons, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192066"}, {"introduction": "As our analysis becomes more sophisticated, we must consider the subtleties of molecular symmetry. Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation are termed 'chemically equivalent,' but this does not always mean they behave identically in the NMR experiment. This practice [@problem_id:2192135] explores the crucial distinction between chemical and magnetic equivalence, a concept essential for understanding why some seemingly simple molecules produce unexpectedly complex spectra.", "problem": "In the study of molecular structure using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the concepts of chemical and magnetic equivalence are fundamental to interpreting spectra. Two nuclei are defined as **chemically equivalent** if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation of the molecule, such as a rotation or a reflection. Chemically equivalent nuclei resonate at the same frequency and thus have the same chemical shift ($\\delta$). For two chemically equivalent nuclei to also be **magnetically equivalent**, they must couple identically to every other magnetic nucleus in the molecule.\n\nConsider that for the purposes of this problem, only protons ($^{1}$H) and fluorine-19 ($^{19}$F) nuclei are magnetically active (spin-1/2), and coupling to all other types of nuclei should be ignored. For couplings between nuclei across a carbon-carbon double bond, the coupling constant for nuclei in a *cis* relationship is different from the coupling constant for nuclei in a *trans* relationship.\n\nGiven these definitions, examine the following list of molecules. Which molecule contains a pair of protons that are chemically equivalent but are *not* magnetically equivalent?\n\nA.

They are magnetically equivalent if, in addition, for every other magnetic nucleus in the molecule, each member of the pair has the same scalar coupling constant to that specific nucleus.

Methane, $\\text{CH}_4$. By $T_{d}$ symmetry, all four protons are chemically equivalent. There are no $^{19}\\text{F}$ nuclei and, by the problem’s instruction, couplings to other nuclei are ignored. Thus no inequality of couplings to other spins can arise; the protons are magnetically equivalent. Not the desired case.\n\nB. *cis*-1,2-Dichloroethene, *cis*-$\\text{CHCl=CHCl}$. The molecule is planar and has symmetry that interchanges the two vinyl protons, so they are chemically equivalent and have the same chemical shift. The only other magnetic nucleus is the other vinyl proton; each proton couples to the other with the same vicinal cis coupling $J_{\\text{HH,cis}}$. There are no $^{19}\\text{F}$ nuclei. Therefore the two protons are magnetically equivalent. Not the desired case.\n\nC. 1,1-Difluoroethene, $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CF}_2$. The two vinylic protons on the same carbon are interchanged by a $C_{2}$ rotation about the C=C axis that also interchanges the two fluorines; hence the two protons are chemically equivalent and have the same chemical shift. Consider magnetic equivalence: label the fluorines $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$. For a given proton $H_{a}$, the three-bond couplings across the double bond satisfy $J_{H_{a},F_{1}}=J_{\\text{cis}}$ and $J_{H_{a},F_{2}}=J_{\\text{trans}}$ (or vice versa), while for the other proton $H_{b}$ these relationships are interchanged: $J_{H_{b},F_{1}}=J_{\\text{trans}}$ and $J_{H_{b},F_{2}}=J_{\\text{cis}}$. Because $J_{\\text{cis}} \\neq J_{\\text{trans}}$, it follows that $J_{H_{a},F_{1}} \\neq J_{H_{b},F_{1}}$ and $J_{H_{a},F_{2}} \\neq J_{H_{b},F_{2}}$. Magnetic equivalence requires equality of couplings to each specific other magnetic nucleus, which is violated here. Therefore the two protons are chemically equivalent but not magnetically equivalent. This is the desired case.\n\nD. Acetaldehyde, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CHO}$. The three methyl protons are chemically equivalent due to rapid rotation about the C–C bond and symmetry; there are no $^{19}\\text{F}$ nuclei. Each methyl proton has the same three-bond coupling to the aldehyde proton, so they are magnetically equivalent. Not the desired case.\n\nE. Benzene, $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$. By $D_{6h}$ symmetry, all six protons are chemically equivalent; there are no $^{19}\\text{F}$ nuclei. Since there are no non-equivalent magnetic nuclei to which couplings could differ, the protons are magnetically equivalent and collapse to a single resonance. Not the desired case.\n\nTherefore, only $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CF}_2$ contains a pair of protons that are chemically equivalent but not magnetically equivalent, due to $J_{\\text{cis}} \\neq J_{\\text{trans}}$ couplings to two distinct $^{19}\\text{F}$ nuclei.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192135"}]}
