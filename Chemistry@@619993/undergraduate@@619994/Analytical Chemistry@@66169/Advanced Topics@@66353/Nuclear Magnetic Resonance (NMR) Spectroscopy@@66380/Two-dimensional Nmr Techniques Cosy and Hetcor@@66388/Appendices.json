The technique being used is ${}^1\\text{H}-{}^1\\text{H}$ Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY), which reveals scalar (J-coupling) interactions between protons.\n\nThe one-dimensional ${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum of 1,3-dichloropropane in a standard deuterated solvent shows two distinct signals. The protons on the carbons adjacent to the chlorine atoms (C1 and C3) appear at a chemical shift of approximately $\\delta = 3.75$ ppm. The protons on the central carbon atom (C2) appear at a chemical shift of approximately $\\delta = 2.20$ ppm.\n\nA COSY spectrum is plotted with the one-dimensional ${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum on both the horizontal (F2) and vertical (F1) axes. The spectrum contains diagonal peaks, which correspond to the signals in the 1D spectrum, and cross-peaks (off-diagonal peaks), which indicate coupling between protons at different chemical shifts. A cross-peak at coordinates $(\\delta_X, \\delta_Y)$ signifies that the protons at chemical shift $\\delta_X$ are J-coupled to the protons at chemical shift $\\delta_Y$.\n\nBased on the structure of 1,3-dichloropropane and the principles of COSY, which of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the expected spectrum?\n\nA. The spectrum will show two diagonal peaks at approximately (3.75, 3.75) and (2.20, 2.20). A pair of cross-peaks will appear at approximately (3.75, 2.20) and (2.20, 3.75).\n\nB.

The spectrum will show three diagonal peaks, corresponding to the three chemically non-equivalent $\\text{CH}_2$ groups, and two pairs of cross-peaks connecting adjacent groups.\n\nD. The spectrum will show only a single diagonal peak because all six protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n\nE. The spectrum will show two diagonal peaks at approximately (3.75, 3.75) and (2.20, 2.20), but only a single cross-peak at (3.75, 2.20), as the correlation is only from the downfield to the upfield protons.", "solution": "Identify distinct proton sets by symmetry. In 1,3-dichloropropane, the two terminal methylene groups are related by symmetry, so their protons have the same chemical shift. Denote the terminal methylenes as C1 and C3 and the central methylene as C2.

In an alkane chain, vicinal ${}^3J_{\\text{HH}}$ couplings exist between adjacent methylene protons. Thus $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C1}}$ couples to $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C2}}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C3}}$ couples to $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C2}}$. Because C1 and C3 are symmetry equivalent, both couplings have the same ${}^3J_{\\text{HH}}$ magnitude and connect the same two chemical shifts, $3.75$ and $2.20$. Long-range ${}^4J_{\\text{HH}}$ across the three-carbon chain between $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C1}}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{C3}}$ is typically negligible and, moreover, any correlation between magnetically equivalent nuclei at the same chemical shift would not produce a resolvable off-diagonal cross-peak.\n\nApply COSY cross-peak principle. In ${}^1\\text{H}-{}^1\\text{H}$ COSY, a cross-peak at $(\\delta_{X},\\delta_{Y})$ indicates $J$-coupling between the spins at $\\delta_{X}$ and $\\delta_{Y}$. The COSY spectrum is symmetric with respect to the diagonal, so a cross-peak at $(\\delta_{X},\\delta_{Y})$ is accompanied by one at $(\\delta_{Y},\\delta_{X})$. Therefore, the vicinal couplings between the terminal and central methylenes produce a pair of cross-peaks at approximately $(3.75,2.20)$ and $(2.20,3.75)$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A states two diagonal peaks and a symmetric pair of cross-peaks at $(3.75,2.20)$ and $(2.20,3.75)$, which matches the above reasoning.\n- B is incorrect because vicinal ${}^3J_{\\text{HH}}$ couplings between different carbons do produce COSY cross-peaks.\n- C is incorrect because there are only two chemically distinct $\\text{CH}_2$ groups due to symmetry, not three.\n- D is incorrect because not all six protons are equivalent; there are two distinct environments.\n- E is incorrect because COSY cross-peaks are symmetric; one does not observe only a single off-diagonal cross-peak.\n\nHence, A is the most accurate description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1485941"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics of COSY, this next practice [@problem_id:1485958] introduces HETCOR, a technique that maps direct connections between protons and the carbon atoms they are attached to.

Then, we apply the rules for COSY and HETCOR spectroscopy.\n\nThe structure is:\n$$\n\\text{CH}_3(\\text{a}) - \\text{C(O)} - \\text{O} - \\text{CH}_2(\\text{b}) - \\text{CH}(\\text{c}) - (\\text{CH}_3(\\text{d}))_2\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Identify unique proton environments.**\nWe can label the protons based on their chemical environment.\n- Protons (a): The three protons on the methyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{C(O)}-$). These are chemically equivalent to each other but unique from all other protons. This is one proton environment.\n- Protons (b): The two protons on the methylene group ($-\\text{OCH}_2-$). These are equivalent to each other. This is a second proton environment.\n- Proton (c): The single proton on the methine group ($-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$). This is a third proton environment.\n- Protons (d): The six protons on the two methyl groups of the isopropyl fragment. Due to free rotation around the C-C bond, these two methyl groups are equivalent, and all six protons are chemically equivalent to each other. This is a fourth proton environment.\n\nThus, there are 4 distinct proton environments (a, b, c, d).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the COSY spectrum.**\nA COSY spectrum displays correlations between J-coupled protons. It has two types of peaks:\n- **Diagonal Peaks**: These appear at coordinates $(\\delta, \\delta)$ for each unique proton environment. Since there are 4 unique proton environments, there will be **4 diagonal peaks**.\n- **Cross-Peaks**: These appear at coordinates $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2)$ where protons at chemical shift $\\delta_1$ are coupled to protons at chemical shift $\\delta_2$. Coupling typically occurs between protons separated by two or three bonds (vicinal coupling). We look for ³J-coupling relationships.\n    - Protons (a) are separated from the nearest protons (b) by four bonds and an oxygen atom, so they show no coupling.\n    - Protons (b) are three bonds away from proton (c). Thus, (b) and (c) are coupled. This will produce a pair of symmetric cross-peaks, one at $(\\delta_b, \\delta_c)$ and one at $(\\delta_c, \\delta_b)$.\n    - Proton (c) is three bonds away from protons (b) and three bonds away from protons (d). So, (c) is coupled to both (b) and (d). The coupling to (b) is already noted. The coupling between (c) and (d) will produce another pair of symmetric cross-peaks at $(\\delta_c, \\delta_d)$ and $(\\delta_d, \\delta_c)$.\n    - Protons (d) are coupled only to proton (c), which is already accounted for.\n\nIn total, we have two coupling partnerships: (b)-(c) and (c)-(d). Each partnership gives rise to a pair of symmetric off-diagonal cross-peaks. Therefore, the total number of cross-peaks is 2 + 2 = **4 cross-peaks**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the HETCOR spectrum.**\nA one-bond HETCOR spectrum shows correlations between protons and the carbon atoms to which they are directly attached. We need to identify the number of unique carbon environments that bear protons.\n\nLet's identify the unique carbon environments first:\n- Carbon from (a): The methyl carbon of the acetyl group, $\\text{CH}_3-$.\n- Carbonyl Carbon: The C=O carbon. This has no attached protons.\n- Carbon from (b): The methylene carbon, $-\\text{OCH}_2-$.\n- Carbon from (c): The methine carbon, $-\\text{CH}-$.\n- Carbon from (d): The two equivalent methyl carbons of the isopropyl group, $-(\\text{CH}_3)_2$.\n\nNow we count the C-H correlations:\n1.  Protons (a) are attached to the methyl carbon of the acetyl group. This gives one HETCOR peak.\n2.  Protons (b) are attached to the methylene carbon. This gives a second HETCOR peak.\n3.  Proton (c) is attached to the methine carbon. This gives a third HETCOR peak.\n4.  Protons (d) are attached to the equivalent methyl carbons of the isopropyl group. This gives a fourth HETCOR peak.\n\nThe carbonyl carbon has no attached protons, so it will not produce a peak in the one-bond HETCOR spectrum. Therefore, there are a total of **4 HETCOR peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and select the correct option.**\nOur analysis yields:\n- 4 diagonal peaks in COSY\n- 4 cross-peaks in COSY\n- 4 peaks in HETCOR\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1485958"}, {"introduction": "In real-world spectroscopic analysis, unexpected results are not just frustrating, but are often sources of deeper insight. This problem [@problem_id:1485986] presents a scenario where an expected HETCOR cross-peak is missing, a frequent puzzle for practicing chemists.

The ${}^1\\text{H}$ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum, acquired in Methanol-d$_4$ ($\\text{CD}_3\\text{OD}$) solution, displays a sharp singlet at a chemical shift of $\\delta = 4.50$ ppm, which integrates to 2 protons. This signal is attributed to a methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$) group. The broadband proton-decoupled ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ NMR spectrum shows a signal at $\\delta = 49.1$ ppm, which is tentatively assigned to the carbon atom of this same $\\text{CH}_2$ group.\n\nTo confirm this ${}^1\\text{H}-{}^{13}\\text{C}$ connectivity, a standard one-bond ${}^1\\text{H}-{}^{13}\\text{C}$ Heteronuclear Correlation (HETCOR) spectrum was recorded. While all other expected HETCOR cross-peaks for the molecule appeared with good intensity, the specific cross-peak that should correlate the ${}^1\\text{H}$ signal at 4.50 ppm to the ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ signal at 49.1 ppm was conspicuously absent.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most plausible explanation for the absence of this specific cross-peak?\n\nA. The protons of the $\\text{CH}_2$ group are magnetically inequivalent (diastereotopic), a condition which fundamentally prevents the formation of a HETCOR cross-peak.\n\nB. The one-bond scalar coupling constant, ${}^1J_{\\text{CH}}$, for this particular $\\text{CH}_2$ group happens to be exactly zero due to a unique combination of electronic and geometric factors.\n\nC. The spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) for the carbon atom at 49.1 ppm is extremely long, preventing its signal from building to a detectable level during the timeframe of the HETCOR experiment.\n\nD. The resonance frequency of the $\\text{CH}_2$ carbon at $\\delta = 49.1$ ppm coincides with the resonance frequency of the solvent, $\\text{CD}_3\\text{OD}$, leading to signal overlap and potential suppression.\n\nE. The $\\text{CH}_2$ group is involved in a chemical exchange process, such as a slow conformational change, that causes severe line broadening of its corresponding carbon signal, making the cross-peak too broad to observe.", "solution": "The experiment seeks a one-bond ${}^1\\text{H}-{}^{13}\\text{C}$ correlation for a $\\text{CH}_2$ group whose ${}^1\\text{H}$ signal is a sharp singlet at $\\delta = 4.50$ and whose ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ is at $\\delta = 49.1$. In a standard one-bond HETCOR (INEPT-based) transfer, the cross-peak intensity for an $I$–$S$ spin pair with scalar coupling $J_{IS}$ is proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J_{IS} \\tau)$ for a suitable transfer delay $\\tau$, with maximal transfer at $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2 J_{IS}}$. Because all other one-bond cross-peaks are observed with good intensity, the pulse sequence timing and the general efficiency of ${}^1J_{\\text{CH}}$-based transfer are appropriate for this sample. Therefore, explanations that would globally suppress one-bond cross-peaks or require ${}^1J_{\\text{CH}} = 0$ are implausible.\n\nOption A is not valid: diastereotopic $\\text{CH}_2$ protons are magnetically inequivalent, but each proton remains one-bond coupled to the same carbon. In HETCOR, such a $\\text{CH}_2$ typically yields two correlations (one from each proton) to the same carbon; magnetic inequivalence does not prevent cross-peaks.\n\nOption B is implausible: for a covalent $\\text{C}-\\text{H}$ bond, ${}^1J_{\\text{CH}}$ arises predominantly from the Fermi contact term and scales with $s$-character at carbon, so ${}^1J_{\\text{CH}} \\neq 0$. One-bond $\\text{C}-\\text{H}$ couplings cannot vanish identically under normal electronic structure; $\\tau = \\frac{1}{2 J_{\\text{CH}}}$ exists and is finite.\n\nOption C is not selective: an unusually long $T_1$ for the carbon would primarily affect recovery between scans and overall sensitivity, not eliminate only a single specific cross-peak when others of comparable type are present. Moreover, in proton-detected, INEPT-based HETCOR, magnetization originates on ${}^1\\text{H}$ and is transferred on a timescale $\\tau \\ll T_1$, so $T_1$ does not selectively suppress one isolated correlation when the rest are strong.\n\nOption E is inconsistent with the data: severe chemical-exchange broadening sufficient to hide the ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ correlation would usually also broaden or distort the attached ${}^1\\text{H}$ resonance. Here, the ${}^1\\text{H}$ at $\\delta = 4.50$ is a sharp singlet, arguing against exchange-induced line broadening for that site.\n\nOption D is the most plausible: the ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ resonance of $\\text{CD}_3\\text{OD}$ lies near $\\delta \\approx 49$ in many field/frequency settings. In a HETCOR, the solvent ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ line can be extremely intense due to solvent concentration, and many standard pulse programs apply ${}^{13}\\text{C}$-channel solvent suppression (selective saturation or gradients) at the solvent carbon frequency to avoid artifacts. If the analyte carbon happens to coincide at $\\delta = 49.1$, such suppression or the sheer overlap with the intense solvent ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ line can annihilate or obscure the analyte’s ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ coherence in the indirect dimension, thereby preventing the appearance of the ${}^1\\text{H}-{}^{13}\\text{C}$ cross-peak at $(\\delta_\\text{H}, \\delta_\\text{C}) = (4.50, 49.1)$. In terms of coherence transfer, any step requiring a well-defined $S_z$ term at that carbon frequency is compromised if that frequency is selectively saturated or dominated by solvent magnetization, so the $I \\rightarrow S$ transfer proportional to $\\sin(\\pi J_{\\text{CH}} \\tau)$ does not produce an observable cross-peak for that site even though other sites correlate normally.\n\nTherefore, coincidence with and suppression/overlap by the $\\text{CD}_3\\text{OD}$ solvent ${}^{13}\\text{C}$ resonance provides the most plausible explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1485986"}]}
