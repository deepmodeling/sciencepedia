The experimental goal is to determine the precise pulse duration, which we will call $t_{2\\pi}$, that results in a full $360^\\circ$ rotation of the bulk magnetization. Such a pulse, like a $180^\\circ$ pulse, returns the magnetization vector to the z-axis and thus produces no signal from the transverse (xy) plane.\n\nIn the calibration experiment, the pulse duration $t_p$ is systematically increased from zero.

If the initial equilibrium magnetization along the z-axis is $M_0$, the transverse magnetization after a pulse of flip angle $\\theta$ is $M_{xy} = M_0 \\sin(\\theta)$. Therefore, the signal intensity is given by:\n$$ S \\propto \\sin(\\theta) $$\n\nA null signal ($S=0$) is observed when $\\sin(\\theta) = 0$.
