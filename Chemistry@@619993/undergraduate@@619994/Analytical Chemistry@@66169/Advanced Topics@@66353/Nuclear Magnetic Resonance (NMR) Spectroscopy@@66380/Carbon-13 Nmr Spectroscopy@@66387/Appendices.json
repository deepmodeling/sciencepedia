Assuming the compound is one of the isomers listed below, which structure is consistent with this spectroscopic data?\n\nA. Cyclohexane\nB. 1-Hexene\nC. 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene\nD. 4-Methyl-1-pentene\nE. Methylcyclopentane", "solution": "The fundamental principle of proton-decoupled Carbon-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ($^{13}$C NMR) spectroscopy is that the number of signals (or peaks) in the spectrum corresponds to the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in a molecule. Carbon atoms are considered chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane of symmetry or an axis of rotation) or by a rapid conformational process. The problem states that a compound with the formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$ exhibits exactly two signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. We must analyze the structure of each of the given isomers to determine how many sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons it contains.\n\nA. Cyclohexane ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$): This is a cyclic alkane. At room temperature, cyclohexane undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This process is so fast on the NMR timescale that all axial and equatorial positions average out, rendering all six carbon atoms chemically equivalent. Consequently, cyclohexane shows only one signal in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nB. 1-Hexene ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}_3$): This is a straight-chain alkene. There are no elements of symmetry that would make any of the carbon atoms equivalent. The six carbons are: C1 ($\\text{CH}_2=$), C2 ($-\\text{CH}=$), C3 ($-\\text{CH}_2-$), C4 ($-\\text{CH}_2-$), C5 ($-\\text{CH}_2-$), and C6 ($-\\text{CH}_3$). Each carbon is in a unique position relative to the double bond and the end of the chain. Therefore, 1-hexene will show six distinct signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nC. 2,3-Dimethyl-2-butene ($\\text{(CH}_3)_2\\text{C}=\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$): This alkene is highly symmetric. There is a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the C=C bond and passing through its midpoint. This symmetry makes the two $sp^2$ hybridized carbons of the double bond chemically equivalent. It also makes all four methyl ($\\text{CH}_3$) groups chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the molecule contains only two sets of non-equivalent carbons: (1) the two carbons of the C=C double bond, and (2) the four carbons of the methyl groups. This structure would produce exactly two signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This matches the experimental data.\n\nD. 4-Methyl-1-pentene ($\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$): This is a branched alkene. Let's number the carbons to check for equivalence.\nC1: $\\text{CH}_2=$\nC2: $-\\text{CH}=$\nC3: $-\\text{CH}_2-$\nC4: $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$\nC5: The two methyl carbons attached to C4.\nThe two methyl groups attached to C4 are equivalent to each other due to free rotation around the C3-C4 single bond. However, carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4 are all in unique chemical environments. Thus, there are five sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons: C1, C2, C3, C4, and the two equivalent C5 methyl carbons. This structure would show five signals. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nE. Methylcyclopentane ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}$): This is a substituted cycloalkane. The methyl substituent breaks the high symmetry of the parent cyclopentane ring. Let's label the ring carbons C1 through C5, with the methyl group attached to C1.\n- The methyl carbon is unique (one signal).\n- The ring carbon C1, to which the methyl group is attached, is unique (a second signal).\n- The ring carbons C2 and C5 are adjacent to C1 and are equivalent to each other due to a plane of symmetry passing through C1, the methyl group, and the C3-C4 bond midpoint. This forms a third set of equivalent carbons.\n- The ring carbons C3 and C4 are further from C1 and are equivalent to each other by the same plane of symmetry. This forms a fourth set.\nIn total, methylcyclopentane has four sets of chemically non-equivalent carbons and would therefore show four signals in its $^{13}$C NMR spectrum. This does not match the observed two signals.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene is predicted to have a $^{13}$C NMR spectrum with two signals.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1429600"}, {"introduction": "While counting signals is a powerful first step, sometimes different isomers have the same number of unique carbons.

The natural abundance of the $^{13}$C isotope is only about 1.1%, which is too low for the signal intensity to be quantitatively reliable.\nB. The chemical shifts of carbon atoms are highly sensitive to their electronic environment, causing overlapping signals that cannot be accurately integrated.\nC.

The gyromagnetic ratios of $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C are different, preventing any quantitative comparison between signals in a spectrum that involves decoupling of protons.\nE. In a proton-decoupled experiment, the coupling information is lost, which is essential for determining the number of carbons contributing to a signal.", "solution": "Goal: Decide whether summing integrated areas of all $^{13}$C signals for each isomer in a standard proton-decoupled $^{13}$C NMR and taking their ratio yields the molar ratio. Identify the primary flaw among the options.\n\nFundamental principle: In NMR, the integrated area $A_{i}$ of a resonance from nucleus type $X$ (here $^{13}$C) is proportional not only to the number of equivalent spins contributing, but also to factors that affect equilibrium magnetization, relaxation, and steady-state enhancement. For a standard proton-decoupled $^{13}$C experiment, an appropriate model for the observed area of carbon site $i$ is\n$$\nA_{i} \\propto N_{i}\\,M_{0,X}\\,E_{i}\\,F_{i},\n$$\nwhere:\n- $N_{i}$ is the number of equivalent carbons giving that resonance,\n- $M_{0,X}$ is the equilibrium magnetization for nucleus $X$ (constant across carbons of the same nucleus under fixed conditions),\n- $E_{i}$ is the site-dependent Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) enhancement factor induced by proton decoupling,\n- $F_{i}$ is the saturation/relaxation factor that depends on the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_{1,i}$ and the repetition time $\\mathrm{TR}$:\n$$\nF_{i} = 1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{TR}}{T_{1,i}}\\right).\n$$\n\nKey consequences:\n1) In a standard proton-decoupled $^{13}$C experiment, proton irradiation during acquisition and often during the relaxation delay induces NOE, so $E_{i}$ varies strongly with the number of directly attached protons and local motion. Typical trends differ among $CH_{3}$, $CH_{2}$, $CH$, and quaternary carbons, producing different $E_{i}$ values.\n2) $T_{1,i}$ differs among carbon types; thus $F_{i}$ varies by site unless $\\mathrm{TR} \\gg \\max_{i} T_{1,i}$, which is seldom satisfied in routine acquisitions. Consequently, the degree of saturation and recovery varies among sites.\n\nFor an isomer $j$ with resonance set $\\{i\\in j\\}$, the total integrated area the student sums is\n$$\nS_{j} = \\sum_{i\\in j} A_{i} \\propto \\sum_{i\\in j} N_{i}\\,E_{i}\\,F_{i}.\n$$\nThe student’s method assumes $E_{i}$ and $F_{i}$ are equal across all carbons in both isomers so that $S_{j} \\propto$ (number of carbons)$\\times$ (moles of isomer $j$). In reality, $E_{i}$ and $F_{i}$ depend on carbon type and environment and differ between, for example, $CH_{3}$, $CH_{2}$, and $CH$ carbons present in 1-propanol and 2-propanol. Therefore, $S_{1}/S_{2}$ is not equal to the molar ratio.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A is not the primary reason. Low natural abundance affects signal-to-noise, but with sufficient scans quantitative work is possible; it does not fundamentally invalidate proportionality.\n- B is not the primary reason. Overlap can be managed or avoided and is not inherent; moreover, the problem states five distinct signals are resolved.\n- C correctly identifies the fundamental flaw: site-dependent NOE enhancements under proton decoupling and differing $T_{1}$ values make $A_{i}$ non-uniformly scaled across carbon types, breaking quantitative proportionality of summed areas to moles.\n- D is incorrect. Different gyromagnetic ratios are irrelevant to comparing carbon signals within a $^{13}$C spectrum; decoupling does not preclude quantitation per se.\n- E is incorrect. Loss of $^{13}$C–$^{1}$H coupling patterns does not remove the ability to count carbons per signal; the problem arises from NOE and relaxation, not from loss of multiplicities.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason the proposed quantitative approach is fundamentally flawed in a standard proton-decoupled $^{13}$C NMR is the variability of NOE and $T_{1}$ among different carbons, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1429596"}]}
