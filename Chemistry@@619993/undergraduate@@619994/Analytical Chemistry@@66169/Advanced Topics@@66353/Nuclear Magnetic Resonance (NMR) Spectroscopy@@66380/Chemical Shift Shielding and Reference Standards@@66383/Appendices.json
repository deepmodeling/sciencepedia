This practice problem builds fundamental intuition by asking you to predict the relative $^{13}$C chemical shifts of methane versus tetrachloromethane, connecting the abstract concept of electronic shielding to the tangible chemical property of electronegativity. Mastering this principle is the essential first step toward interpreting any NMR spectrum and assigning signals to specific atoms within a molecule. [@problem_id:1429831]", "problem": "In the field of analytical chemistry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the structure of molecules. The chemical shift, denoted by $\\delta$ and measured in parts per million (ppm), provides information about the local electronic environment of an atomic nucleus. The spectrum is typically referenced against an internal standard, such as tetramethylsilane ($\\text{Si}(\\text{CH}_3)_4$), for which the chemical shift is defined as $\\delta=0.0$ ppm.\n\nConsider the $^{13}$C NMR spectra of two simple organic molecules: methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) and tetrachloromethane ($\\text{CCl}_4$). Let $\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$ be the chemical shift of the carbon atom in methane and $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$ be the chemical shift of the carbon atom in tetrachloromethane.

A nucleus is surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field, $B_0$, is applied, these electrons circulate and generate a small, local induced magnetic field, $B_{\\text{induced}}$, that opposes the external field. The effective magnetic field experienced by the nucleus is therefore $B_{\\text{eff}} = B_0 - B_{\\text{induced}}$. This phenomenon is called **shielding**.\n\nA higher electron density around a nucleus leads to a larger $B_{\\text{induced}}$, which means the nucleus is more shielded. A more shielded nucleus experiences a weaker effective magnetic field ($B_{\\text{eff}}$) and thus resonates at a lower frequency for a given $B_0$. By convention in NMR, a lower frequency corresponds to a smaller chemical shift ($\\delta$), a position referred to as **upfield**.\n\nConversely, if electron density is withdrawn from the vicinity of a nucleus, $B_{\\text{induced}}$ is smaller, and the nucleus is less shielded, or **deshielded**. A deshielded nucleus experiences a stronger effective magnetic field ($B_{\\text{eff}}$) and resonates at a higher frequency. A higher frequency corresponds to a larger chemical shift ($\\delta$), a position referred to as **downfield**.\n\nWe can apply this principle to methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) and tetrachloromethane ($\\text{CCl}_4$) by considering the electronegativity of the atoms bonded to the central carbon. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond.\nThe electronegativity values on the Pauling scale are approximately:\n- Carbon (C): 2.55\n- Hydrogen (H): 2.20\n- Chlorine (Cl): 3.16\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Methane ($\\text{CH}_4$)**\nIn the C-H bonds of methane, carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. This means that the electron density in the bonds is slightly polarized towards the carbon atom. This leads to a relatively high electron density around the carbon nucleus in methane, making it a well-shielded nucleus. Consequently, the $^{13}$C chemical shift for methane ($\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$) is expected to be small and upfield (close to the TMS standard). In fact, its experimental value is approximately -2 ppm.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Tetrachloromethane ($\\text{CCl}_4$)**\nIn the C-Cl bonds of tetrachloromethane, chlorine is significantly more electronegative than carbon. As a result, each of the four chlorine atoms strongly withdraws electron density from the central carbon atom via the inductive effect. This drastically reduces the electron density around the carbon nucleus. The carbon nucleus in $\\text{CCl}_4$ is therefore strongly deshielded. This deshielding effect will cause it to resonate at a much higher frequency, resulting in a large, downfield chemical shift ($\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$). Its experimental value is approximately 96 ppm.\n\n**Step 3: Compare and Conclude**\nComparing the two, the carbon in $\\text{CCl}_4$ is heavily deshielded while the carbon in $\\text{CH}_4$ is shielded. Therefore, the chemical shift of tetrachloromethane will be significantly larger than that of methane: $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n- **A:** This is incorrect. The mass of the substituents is not the primary factor determining chemical shift. It is the electronic environment.\n- **B:** This statement correctly claims that $\\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CH}_4}$. The reasoning provided is also correct: the high electronegativity of chlorine withdraws electron density (deshielding), leading to a higher chemical shift.\n- **C:** This statement has the incorrect relationship ($\\delta_{\\text{CH}_4} > \\delta_{\\text{CCl}_4}$). The reasoning is flawed; although chlorine atoms have more electrons than hydrogen atoms, their high electronegativity causes them to pull electron density *away* from the carbon, resulting in deshielding, not shielding.\n- **D:** This statement is incorrect. While both molecules are nonpolar overall due to their tetrahedral symmetry, this symmetry does not negate the strong local inductive effects of the highly polar C-Cl bonds. The local electronic environment is what matters for chemical shift, and it is vastly different in the two molecules.\n\nThus, the only correct statement and reasoning is provided in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1429831"}, {"introduction": "While the underlying physics of shielding is expressed as a frequency shift in Hertz ($Hz$), this absolute value depends directly on the spectrometer's magnetic field strength.

Since the exchange between the different protonation states (C, Z, and A) is rapid on the NMR timescale, the observed chemical shift, $\\delta_{obs}$, will be a weighted average of the chemical shifts of the individual species present in the solution. The weighting factor for each species is its mole fraction.\n\nThe general equation for the observed chemical shift is:\n$$ \\delta_{obs} = x_C \\delta_C + x_Z \\delta_Z + x_A \\delta_A $$\nwhere $x_C$, $x_Z$, and $x_A$ are the mole fractions of the cation, zwitterion, and anion, respectively.\n\nWe first need to determine the relative populations of the three species at pD = 8.50. We can use the two given $pKa$ values to assess the dominant species.\n\nThe first equilibrium is the deprotonation of the cation (C) to form the zwitterion (Z):\n$$ C \\rightleftharpoons Z + D^+ \\quad (pKa_1 = 2.75) $$\nThe second equilibrium is the deprotonation of the zwitterion (Z) to form the anion (A):\n$$ Z \\rightleftharpoons A + D^+ \\quad (pKa_2 = 10.12) $$\n\nLet's analyze the state of these equilibria at pD = 8.50.\nFor the first equilibrium, the pD (8.50) is much greater than $pKa_1$ (2.75). The difference is $8.50 - 2.75 = 5.75$ pD units. This means the equilibrium lies overwhelmingly to the right. The ratio of $[Z]$ to $[C]$ can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the first equilibrium:\n$$ pD = pKa_1 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[C]}\\right) $$\n$$ 8.50 = 2.75 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[C]}\\right) $$\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{[Z]}{[C]}\\right) = 5.75 \\implies \\frac{[Z]}{[C]} = 10^{5.75} \\approx 5.6 \\times 10^5 $$\nThe concentration of the cation (C) is negligible compared to the zwitterion (Z). Thus, we can approximate the mole fraction $x_C \\approx 0$.\n\nNow we consider the second equilibrium. The pD (8.50) is reasonably close to $pKa_2$ (10.12), so we expect a significant equilibrium mixture of the zwitterion (Z) and the anion (A).

So, $R = 10^{-1.62} \\approx 0.023988$.\n\nSince the cation concentration is negligible, the total concentration of alanine species is approximately $[Z] + [A]$.
