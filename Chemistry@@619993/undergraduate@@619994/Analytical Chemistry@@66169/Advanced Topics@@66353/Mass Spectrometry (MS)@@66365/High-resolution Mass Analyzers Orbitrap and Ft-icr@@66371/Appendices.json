By considering a catastrophic failure—a magnet quench—you can solidify your knowledge of why ions undergo cyclotron motion and how they are trapped for analysis [@problem_id:1444907].", "problem": "An analytical chemist is operating a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer to analyze a large biomolecule. Inside the ICR cell, a single ion with charge $+e$ has been excited into a stable, coherent circular orbit in the plane perpendicular to a strong, uniform magnetic field, $\\vec{B}$. This cyclotron motion induces a detectable image current in the receiver plates. The ion is also confined along the axis of the magnetic field by a static electric potential applied to a pair of \"trapping\" plates located at either end of the cylindrical cell.\n\nSuddenly, the superconducting magnet undergoes a \"quench,\" a rapid and complete loss of its magnetic field, such that $\\vec{B}$ drops to zero almost instantaneously. The electric potential on the trapping plates remains unchanged.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the immediate consequence for the ion's motion and the detected signal?\n\nA. The ion is accelerated along the magnetic field axis by the trapping potential and collides with one of the trapping plates.\n\nB. The ion's motion becomes a random, chaotic trajectory, but it remains trapped indefinitely within the cell by the electric field.\n\nC. The ion stops all motion and remains suspended at the location where the magnetic field vanished.\n\nD. The ion ceases its circular motion and travels in a straight line at its last instantaneous velocity until it collides with the radial walls of the cell, causing the induced signal to terminate.\n\nE. The ion continues its circular motion at the same frequency and radius, but the signal is lost because the detector electronics are coupled to the magnet.", "solution": "The motion of a charged particle in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields is governed by the Lorentz force equation:\n$$ \\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\nwhere $q$ is the charge of the particle, $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field, $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the particle, and $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial state (before the quench).**\nIn a standard FT-ICR cell, the fields are set up to serve distinct purposes.\nThe strong, uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is directed along the central axis of the cell (let's call it the z-axis). The magnetic force component, $\\vec{F}_B = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})$, acts perpendicular to both the ion's velocity and the magnetic field. For an ion moving in the xy-plane, this force is directed radially inward, providing the centripetal force required for circular motion. The frequency of this motion, the cyclotron frequency, is given by $\\omega_c = \\frac{qB}{m}$, and is the basis for mass determination.\nThe static electric field $\\vec{E}$ is generated by the trapping plates. This field is primarily axial (along the z-axis) and creates a potential well that prevents the ion from escaping the cell along the z-direction. It exerts a restoring force, $F_E = qE_z$, that pushes the ion back towards the central xy-plane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the state immediately after the magnet quench.**\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ drops to zero. We must re-evaluate the Lorentz force under this new condition.\n$$ \\vec{B} \\rightarrow 0 $$\nThe magnetic force term in the Lorentz equation becomes zero:\n$$ \\vec{F}_B = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\rightarrow q(\\vec{v} \\times 0) = 0 $$\nThe total force on the ion is now only due to the electric field:\n$$ \\vec{F} = q\\vec{E} $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the subsequent motion of the ion.**\nWithout the magnetic force, there is no longer a centripetal force to maintain the ion's circular path in the xy-plane. According to Newton's first law, an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. At the instant the magnetic field vanishes, the ion has an instantaneous tangential velocity $\\vec{v}$. Since the force that was causing it to change direction (the magnetic force) is now gone, the ion will continue to travel in a straight line along the direction of that instantaneous velocity vector.\n\nThis straight-line path is in the xy-plane (or close to it). The ion will travel along this tangent until it collides with a physical barrier. The radial boundary of the ICR cell is typically formed by the excitation and detection plates. Therefore, the ion will collide with one of these plates.\n\nThe trapping electric field $\\vec{E}$ is still active. However, its primary function is to provide an axial confining force. It prevents the ion from drifting out of the cell along the z-axis but does not prevent its radial motion in the absence of a magnetic field.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the effect on the detected signal.**\nThe signal in FT-ICR is an \"image current\" induced in the detection plates by the coherent, periodic motion of a packet of ions moving past them. When the magnetic field disappears, the circular motion ceases. The ion packet immediately disperses as each ion travels in a straight line. The coherent, periodic motion is destroyed, and thus the image current signal terminates instantly.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given options.**\nA. Incorrect. The trapping potential is *confining*, meaning it creates a force that pushes the ion towards the center of the cell along the z-axis, not accelerates it towards the end plates.\nB. Incorrect. The motion is not chaotic; it is a simple straight-line trajectory according to Newton's first law. The ion is not trapped indefinitely because its radial motion is now unconstrained.\nC. Incorrect. The ion possesses a significant tangential velocity from its cyclotron motion, so it will not simply stop.\nD. Correct. The circular motion ceases due to the loss of the centripetal magnetic force. The ion continues moving in a straight line (tangent to its former circular path) due to its inertia, eventually colliding with the radial walls of the cell. This loss of coherent circular motion terminates the induced image current signal.\nE. Incorrect. The circular motion is fundamentally dependent on the magnetic field; if $B=0$, the cyclotron motion cannot occur. The detector electronics are separate from the magnet's function in causing ion motion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1444907"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of the underlying principles, we can now move to quantifying an instrument's performance.
