Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a \"soft\" technique that transfers molecules from solution to the gas phase as intact ions, making it ideal for analyzing delicate compounds. In positive ion mode, neutral molecules often become charged by forming adducts with available cations, such as protons ($H^+$) or sodium ions ($Na^+$). This exercise will challenge you to identify the specific adduct formed by matching the predicted mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of potential ions with the experimentally observed signal, a fundamental skill in mass spectrometry.", "problem": "An analytical chemist is tasked with confirming the molecular weight of a newly synthesized, neutral small molecule, designated \"Compound M\".
