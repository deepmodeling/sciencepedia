In an initial experiment, a bare fused silica capillary with a total length of 50.0 cm and a length to the detector of 41.5 cm is used. A voltage of 20.0 kV is applied with standard polarity, where the inlet is the anode (+) and the outlet is the cathode (-). Under these conditions, a neutral marker, thiourea, is detected at a migration time of 2.50 minutes. The target analyte, the benzoate anion, is detected at 4.00 minutes.\n\nTo improve the separation speed, the chemist modifies the procedure. The inner surface of the capillary is dynamically coated with a cationic surfactant, which reverses the direction of the Electroosmotic Flow (EOF). The magnitude of the new, reversed electroosmotic mobility is measured to be 85.0% of the magnitude of the original EOF mobility. For the subsequent analysis of the benzoate anion, the polarity of the applied voltage is also reversed (inlet is cathode, outlet is anode) to ensure the anion migrates towards the detector.\n\nAssuming all other experimental parameters (applied voltage magnitude, capillary dimensions, buffer composition affecting electrophoretic mobility) remain constant, calculate the new migration time for the benzoate anion under these modified conditions.
