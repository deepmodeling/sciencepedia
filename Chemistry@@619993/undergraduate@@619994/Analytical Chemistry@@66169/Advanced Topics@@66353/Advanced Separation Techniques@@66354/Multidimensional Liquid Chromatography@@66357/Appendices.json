The first dimension ($^{1}$D) employs reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC), which uses a nonpolar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase.

The retention factor is defined as $k = \\frac{t_{R} - t_{0}}{t_{0}}$, where $t_{0}$ is the column dead time. In RP-LC, nonpolar (hydrophobic) analytes exhibit stronger interactions with the nonpolar stationary phase, leading to larger $k$ and thus larger $t_{R}$. Conversely, highly polar and hydrophilic analytes interact weakly with the nonpolar stationary phase and prefer the polar mobile phase, resulting in small $k$ and therefore small $^{1}t_{R}$. Hence, polar analytes elute early in $^{1}$D and appear at low $^{1}t_{R}$ (left side of the 2D plot).\n\nIn the second dimension (HILIC), the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is less polar (high organic content), with a water-enriched layer at the stationary phase surface. Polar and hydrophilic analytes have stronger interactions with the polar stationary phase and partition more into this layer, increasing their retention factor $k$ and thus increasing $t_{R}$. Therefore, highly polar analytes exhibit large $^{2}t_{R}$ (upper side of the 2D plot).\n\nCombining both behaviors, analytes that are highly polar and hydrophilic will have low $^{1}t_{R}$ in RP-LC and high $^{2}t_{R}$ in HILIC, placing them in the region of low $^{1}t_{R}$ and high $^{2}t_{R}$.\n\nThus, the correct region is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1458072"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of any LCxLC system is the modulator, which samples the effluent from the first dimension and injects it into the second.
