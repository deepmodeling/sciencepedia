The method employs a reversed-phase column and a mobile phase gradient. For the first several injections of a standard solution, the system operates as expected, with a maximum backpressure reading of 620 bar. However, after injecting a newly prepared sample from a bulk manufacturing batch, the pressure rapidly climbs to 1150 bar, exceeding the instrument's safety limit and causing an emergency shutdown. The programmed flow rate, temperature, and mobile phase composition settings were not altered.\n\nWhich of the following are plausible and distinct causes for this sudden, severe increase in system backpressure? Select all that apply.\n\nA. A major leak has developed at a connection fitting between the pump and the injector.\n\nB.

The system backpressure is then given by\n$$\n\\Delta P = Q\\,R_{\\text{hyd}}.\n$$\nA sudden, severe pressure increase at fixed $Q$ therefore requires a sudden increase in $R_{\\text{hyd}}$. For a packed-bed column, a standard form (Kozeny–Carman scaling) gives\n$$\n\\Delta P \\propto \\mu \\,\\frac{L}{d_{p}^{2}}\\,u\\,\\Phi(\\epsilon),\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the mobile-phase dynamic viscosity, $L$ is the column length, $d_{p}$ is the particle diameter, $u$ is the interstitial velocity, and $\\Phi(\\epsilon)$ encodes the porosity dependence.

A major leak adds a parallel low-resistance path. If the column path has resistance $R$ and the leak path has resistance $R_{\\ell}$, then the equivalent resistance is\n$$\nR_{\\text{eq}}=\\left(R^{-1}+R_{\\ell}^{-1}\\right)^{-1}<R,\n$$\nso at fixed $Q$ one obtains $\\Delta P=Q\\,R_{\\text{eq}}$ that is lower, not higher. A leak causes pressure to drop or fluctuate, not to spike upward. Therefore A does not plausibly cause a severe pressure increase.\n\nB. Preparing the mobile phase with a higher fraction of a more viscous component increases $\\mu$, and since $\\Delta P \\propto \\mu$ this would increase backpressure. However, the method ran normally for several standard injections under the same programmed gradient. A composition error present in the mobile phase would have increased pressure from the start rather than suddenly coincident with a new sample injection. Absent an independent change such as an autoswitch to a newly prepared bottle at exactly that moment (not stated), B does not explain the sudden, sample-triggered spike. Hence, B is not the best plausible cause for the observed sudden increase.\n\nC. A failure of the column oven thermostat causing the column temperature to drop by twenty on the Celsius scale increases the solvent viscosity $\\mu(T)$ and thus $R_{\\text{hyd}}$. Because $\\Delta P \\propto \\mu$, a sufficiently large temperature decrease can cause a large pressure rise. Such a hardware failure can occur abruptly, matching the sudden pressure increase. Therefore C is a plausible cause.\n\nD. Unfiltered sample containing insoluble particulates can rapidly load onto and clog the column inlet frit, decreasing the effective porosity or effective radius $r$ of flow paths, which, via $R \\propto \\mu L/r^{4}$ or via a sharp increase in $\\Phi(\\epsilon)$, causes $R_{\\text{hyd}}$ to increase dramatically. This typically presents as a sudden, severe pressure spike upon or shortly after injection of such a sample. Therefore D is a plausible cause.\n\nE. An air bubble in a pump head reduces delivered flow per stroke and commonly yields erratic, reduced, or oscillatory pressure; it does not create a sustained increase in hydraulic resistance. This generally manifests as pressure collapse or pulsation, not a sustained high-pressure spike. Therefore E is not a plausible cause of the observed severe increase.\n\nF. A marginally soluble analyte that precipitates under the initial mobile-phase conditions can nucleate solids inside the tubing between the injector and column, forming a partial blockage that reduces the effective radius $r$ and increases $R \\propto \\mu L/r^{4}$. This produces a sudden and severe backpressure increase, often exactly upon injecting such a sample.
