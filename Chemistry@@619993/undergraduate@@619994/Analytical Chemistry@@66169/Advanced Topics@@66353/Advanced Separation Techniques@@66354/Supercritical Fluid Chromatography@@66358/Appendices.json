The modifier must be sufficiently polar to interact with analytes and active sites (e.g., silanols) to improve peak shape, while also being miscible with supercritical $CO_2$ under operating conditions.\n\nEvaluate each option based on polarity and miscibility:\n- Hexane (A) and toluene (D) are nonpolar organic solvents. Adding them to $CO_2$ does not increase the polarity or solvent strength for polar analytes, so they are unsuitable as polar modifiers in this context.\n- Water (B) is highly polar and can improve elution of very polar analytes in liquid chromatography, but it has very limited solubility in supercritical $CO_2$. Although small amounts can sometimes be added with an organic co-solvent, water alone is not generally effective as the primary modifier in SFC due to miscibility constraints and operational challenges.\n- Methanol (C) is polar, protic, and exhibits good miscibility with supercritical $CO_2$ at typical SFC pressures and temperatures.

The goal is to separate and quantify a newly synthesized drug candidate, \"aminopyridine-X,\" a small molecule with several strongly basic amine functional groups. The SFC system uses a stationary phase based on unmodified silica particles and a mobile phase consisting of supercritical carbon dioxide with methanol as a co-solvent. Initial experiments show severe peak tailing for aminopyridine-X, indicating strong, unwanted interactions with the stationary phase.

Isopropylamine ($(CH_3)_2CHNH_2$)\nC. Toluene ($C_7H_8$)\nD. Deionized Water ($H_2O$)\nE. Sodium acetate ($CH_3COONa$)", "solution": "The problem asks to identify the most suitable additive to improve the peak shape of a strongly basic analyte in Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) using a silica-based stationary phase.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the root cause of the peak tailing.**\nThe stationary phase is unmodified silica. The surface of silica contains silanol groups ($\\text{Si-OH}$), which are weakly acidic. The analyte, \"aminopyridine-X,\" is described as strongly basic due to its amine functional groups. Peak tailing in chromatography occurs when a fraction of the analyte molecules undergoes stronger-than-average retention on the column. In this case, the basic amine groups of the analyte can engage in strong acid-base interactions (or strong hydrogen bonding) with the acidic silanol groups on the silica surface. These high-energy interaction sites hold onto the analyte molecules for longer than the average retention time, causing them to elute slowly and create a \"tail\" on the peak.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the function of the required additive.**\nTo prevent this tailing, the additive must suppress the strong interaction between the basic analyte and the acidic stationary phase. The most effective strategy is to introduce a \"masking agent\" that will compete with the analyte for the active sites on the stationary phase. Since the analyte is basic and the problematic sites on the column are acidic, the ideal additive would be a base that is stronger or more concentrated than the analyte, which can preferentially bind to the acidic silanol groups and effectively \"shield\" them from the analyte.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each option based on this requirement.**\n\n*   **A. Trifluoroacetic acid ($CF_3COOH$):** This is a strong acid. Adding an acid to the mobile phase would protonate the basic amine groups on the analyte, turning them into positively charged ammonium ions ($R\\text{-NH}_3^+$). This would likely *increase* their electrostatic interaction with the deprotonated, negatively charged siloxide sites ($\\text{Si-O}^-$) on the silica surface, worsening the peak tailing or causing irreversible binding. Therefore, this is an incorrect choice.\n\n*   **B. Isopropylamine ($(CH_3)_2CHNH_2$):** This is a primary amine and a relatively strong, volatile organic base. When added to the mobile phase, it will readily compete with the basic analyte for the acidic silanol sites on the silica stationary phase. By saturating these active sites, the isopropylamine acts as a competitive binding agent, preventing the analyte from being excessively retained. This allows the analyte to move through the column more uniformly, resulting in a sharp, symmetrical peak. Its organic nature also ensures good solubility in the methanol/$CO_2$ mobile phase. This is the most effective choice.\n\n*   **C. Toluene ($C_7H_8$):** This is a non-polar, aprotic solvent. It has no significant acidic or basic properties. It would not interact with the acidic silanol sites and therefore would not prevent the basic analyte from binding to them. It would merely act as a weak non-polar component of the mobile phase, which is not helpful.\n\n*   **D. Deionized Water ($H_2O$):** Water is amphiprotic (can act as a weak acid or weak base). While it can hydrogen bond with the silanol groups, it is not a strong enough base to effectively outcompete the strongly basic analyte for the most acidic sites. Its presence might slightly alter the retention but would not be an effective tool for eliminating strong tailing caused by acid-base interactions.\n\n*   **E. Sodium acetate ($CH_3COONa$):** This is an ionic salt. While the acetate ion is basic, inorganic salts like sodium acetate have extremely poor solubility in the largely non-polar supercritical $CO_2$/methanol mobile phase. It would likely precipitate and clog the chromatography system (tubing, injector, and column). Furthermore, non-volatile additives are generally undesirable as they can contaminate the system and the detector.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, a volatile organic base is needed to act as a competitive agent for the acidic sites on the stationary phase. Isopropylamine fits this description perfectly and is a common type of additive used for this exact purpose in SFC and normal-phase HPLC.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1477973"}, {"introduction": "For complex samples containing analytes with a wide range of polarities, a constant mobile phase composition is often insufficient.
