Due to the sheer number of expected components, a standard one-dimensional gas chromatography setup is deemed insufficient. The chemist opts for a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) system. The first-dimension separation is performed on a long, non-polar column which has a theoretical peak capacity of 200 for the compounds of interest. The effluent from this column is then subjected to rapid, repeated separation on a short, polar second-dimension column. The peak capacity for a single one of these rapid second-dimension separations is 40.
