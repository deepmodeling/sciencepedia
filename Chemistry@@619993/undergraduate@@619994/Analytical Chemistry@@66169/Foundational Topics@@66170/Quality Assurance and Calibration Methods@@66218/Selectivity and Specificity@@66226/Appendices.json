During characterization, it is discovered that the sensor also exhibits a response to acetaminophen, a common over-the-counter pain reliever, which acts as an interferent. The response of the sensor is known to be linear with respect to the concentration of both substances.\n\nTo quantify this interference, a series of experiments are conducted. It is found that the signal generated by the sensor when immersed in a solution containing $1.50 \\text{ mM}$ of glucose (and no acetaminophen) is identical to the signal generated when it is immersed in a solution containing $47.5 \\text{ mM}$ of acetaminophen (and no glucose).\n\nThe selectivity coefficient, $K_{\\text{Analyte, Interferent}}$, is a measure of a sensor's preference for the analyte over an interferent. It is defined as the ratio of the sensor's sensitivity towards the interferent to its sensitivity towards the primary analyte.
