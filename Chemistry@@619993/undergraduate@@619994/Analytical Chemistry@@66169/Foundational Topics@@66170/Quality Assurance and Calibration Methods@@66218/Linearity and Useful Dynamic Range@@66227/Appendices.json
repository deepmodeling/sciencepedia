The sensor's response signal, $S$, is a function of the analyte's molar concentration, $C$. This relationship is well-described by the Langmuir isotherm model:\n\n$$S(C) = S_{max} \\frac{K_a C}{1 + K_a C}$$\n\nwhere $S_{max}$ is the maximum possible signal at sensor saturation, and $K_a$ is the equilibrium association constant for the binding of the analyte to the sensor surface.\n\nFor quantitative analysis, it is often desirable to operate within the linear dynamic range of the sensor. The ideal linear response, denoted as $S_{lin}(C)$, is defined by the initial slope of the isotherm, i.e., the tangent to the $S(C)$ curve at $C=0$.

This is defined as the line passing through the origin with a slope equal to the initial slope of the isotherm $S(C)$ at $C=0$. The slope is found by taking the first derivative of $S(C)$ with respect to $C$.\n\nThe Langmuir isotherm is given by:\n$$S(C) = S_{max} \\frac{K_a C}{1 + K_a C}$$\n\nTo find the derivative, $S'(C) = \\frac{dS}{dC}$, we apply the quotient rule for differentiation, where $u = S_{max} K_a C$ and $v = 1 + K_a C$.
