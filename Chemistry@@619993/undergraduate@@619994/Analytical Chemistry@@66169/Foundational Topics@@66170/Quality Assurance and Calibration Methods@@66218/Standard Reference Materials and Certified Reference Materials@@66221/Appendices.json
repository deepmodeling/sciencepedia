This is a classic application of the Student's t-test for comparing a sample mean to a known population mean.\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that there is no significant difference between the experimental mean ($\\bar{x}$) and the certified value ($\\mu_0$), meaning any observed difference is due to random error. The alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) is that a significant difference exists, which would indicate the presence of a systematic error (bias).\n$H_0: \\bar{x} = \\mu_0$\n$H_A: \\bar{x} \\neq \\mu_0$\n\nWe will calculate the experimental t-value, $t_{calc}$, and compare it to the given critical t-value, $t_{critical}$.

If $|t_{calc}| \\leq t_{critical}$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning there is no statistical evidence of a significant difference at the chosen confidence level.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the experimental mean ($\\bar{x}$)**\nThe experimental mean is the average of the six replicate measurements.\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{32.58 + 32.25 + 32.49 + 32.31 + 32.65 + 32.42}{6}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{194.70}{6} = 32.45 \\text{ mg/g}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the experimental standard deviation ($s$)**\nThe sample standard deviation is calculated using the formula:\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\n$$\nwhere $n=6$ is the number of measurements, and $n-1 = 5$ is the degrees of freedom.\n\nFirst, we find the squared deviations from the mean:\n*   $(32.58 - 32.45)^2 = (0.13)^2 = 0.0169$\n*   $(32.25 - 32.45)^2 = (-0.20)^2 = 0.0400$\n*   $(32.49 - 32.45)^2 = (0.04)^2 = 0.0016$\n*   $(32.31 - 32.45)^2 = (-0.14)^2 = 0.0196$\n*   $(32.65 - 32.45)^2 = (0.20)^2 = 0.0400$\n*   $(32.42 - 32.45)^2 = (-0.03)^2 = 0.0009$\n\nNext, we sum these squared deviations:\n$$\n\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = 0.0169 + 0.0400 + 0.0016 + 0.0196 + 0.0400 + 0.0009 = 0.1190\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the standard deviation:\n$$\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1190}{6-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1190}{5}} = \\sqrt{0.0238} \\approx 0.15427 \\text{ mg/g}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the experimental t-value ($t_{calc}$)**\nThe t-value is calculated using the formula:\n$$\nt_{calc} = \\frac{|\\bar{x} - \\mu_0|}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nWe have:\n*   $\\bar{x} = 32.45$ mg/g\n*   $\\mu_0 = 32.50$ mg/g (the certified value)\n*   $s = 0.15427$ mg/g\n*   $n=6$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\nt_{calc} = \\frac{|32.45 - 32.50|}{0.15427 / \\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.15427 / 2.4495} = \\frac{0.05}{0.0630} \\approx 0.7937\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Compare $t_{calc}$ with $t_{critical}$ and draw a conclusion**\nThe calculated t-value is $t_{calc} \\approx 0.794$.\nThe critical t-value given in the problem for a 95% confidence level and 5 degrees of freedom is $t_{critical} = 2.571$.\n\nWe compare the absolute value of our calculated t-value with the critical value:\n$$\n|t_{calc}| < t_{critical} \\quad (0.794 < 2.571)\n$$\n\nSince the calculated t-value is less than the critical t-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is no statistically significant difference between the experimental mean and the certified value at the 95% confidence level. Therefore, we conclude that there is no evidence of a significant systematic error or bias in the analytical method.\n\nThis conclusion matches option B.\n- Option A is incorrect because $t_{calc} < t_{critical}$.\n- Option C is incorrect because the experimental mean (32.45) is not exactly equal to the certified value (32.50).\n- Option D is incorrect because the conclusion is not based on the magnitude of the standard deviation alone, but on the t-statistic which relates the mean's deviation to the measurement uncertainty.\n- Option E is incorrect because a t-test is appropriate for small sample sizes like n=6.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1475989"}, {"introduction": "Beyond verifying accuracy, CRMs are essential for creating traceable calibration standards.
