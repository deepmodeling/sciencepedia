The analytical procedure involves extracting the pesticide from the soil and then analyzing the extract using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV).\n\nFor the analysis, a series of external standards of pure Chlorpyrifos-Methyl in a solvent were prepared and their absorbance measured to create a calibration curve. The data are as follows:\n- Standard 1: 1.00 mg/L, Absorbance = 0.150\n- Standard 2: 2.00 mg/L, Absorbance = 0.300\n- Standard 3: 5.00 mg/L, Absorbance = 0.750\n- Standard 4: 10.00 mg/L, Absorbance = 1.500\n\nA soil sample with a mass of 25.0 g is subjected to a solvent extraction procedure, yielding a final extract volume of 50.0 mL.

Then, we compute the relative systematic error.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the calibration equation**\n\nThe relationship between absorbance ($A$) and concentration ($C$) is established by the external standards. According to the Beer-Lambert law, we expect a linear relationship of the form $A = kC + b$, where $k$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nFrom the provided data points, we can determine the slope $k$. Let's use the first and last points:\n$$k = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta C} = \\frac{1.500 - 0.150}{10.00 \\, \\text{mg/L} - 1.00 \\, \\text{mg/L}} = \\frac{1.350}{9.00 \\, \\text{mg/L}} = 0.150 \\, \\text{L/mg}$$\nWe can check if the line passes through the origin by using another point, e.g., for Standard 2: $A = (0.150 \\, \\text{L/mg}) \\times (2.00 \\, \\text{mg/L}) = 0.300$. This matches the data, so the y-intercept $b=0$.\nThe calibration equation is $A = (0.150 \\, \\text{L/mg}) \\times C$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the apparent concentration in the extract**\n\nThe student uses the sample absorbance, $A_{sample} = 0.540$, to find the concentration of the pesticide in the analyzed extract. Let's call this $C_{apparent}$.\n$$C_{apparent} = \\frac{A_{sample}}{k} = \\frac{0.540}{0.150 \\, \\text{L/mg}} = 3.60 \\, \\text{mg/L}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the student's reported concentration in soil (Reported Value)**\n\nThe student incorrectly assumes that the concentration found in the extract, $C_{apparent}$, corresponds to the total amount of pesticide from the soil sample.\nFirst, calculate the mass of pesticide in the extract volume, $V_{extract} = 50.0 \\, \\text{mL} = 0.0500 \\, \\text{L}$.\n$$m_{pesticide, apparent} = C_{apparent} \\times V_{extract} = 3.60 \\, \\text{mg/L} \\times 0.0500 \\, \\text{L} = 0.180 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nNext, calculate the concentration in the solid soil sample, using the soil mass $m_{soil} = 25.0 \\, \\text{g} = 0.0250 \\, \\text{kg}$.\n$$\\text{Reported Concentration} = \\frac{m_{pesticide, apparent}}{m_{soil}} = \\frac{0.180 \\, \\text{mg}}{0.0250 \\, \\text{kg}} = 7.20 \\, \\text{mg/kg}$$\nThis is the \"Reported Value\".\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the true concentration in soil (True Value)**\n\nTo find the true value, we must account for the recovery efficiency, $\\eta = 75.0\\% = 0.750$. The mass of pesticide measured in the extract, $m_{pesticide, apparent} = 0.180 \\, \\text{mg}$, is only 75.0% of the true mass of pesticide that was originally in the soil sample, $m_{pesticide, true}$.\n$$m_{pesticide, apparent} = m_{pesticide, true} \\times \\eta$$\n$$m_{pesticide, true} = \\frac{m_{pesticide, apparent}}{\\eta} = \\frac{0.180 \\, \\text{mg}}{0.750} = 0.240 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nNow, we can calculate the true concentration in the soil sample.\n$$\\text{True Concentration} = \\frac{m_{pesticide, true}}{m_{soil}} = \\frac{0.240 \\, \\text{mg}}{0.0250 \\, \\text{kg}} = 9.60 \\, \\text{mg/kg}$$\nThis is the \"True Value\".\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the relative systematic error**\n\nThe relative systematic error is defined as $\\text{Error} = \\frac{\\text{Reported Value} - \\text{True Value}}{\\text{True Value}}$.\n$$\\text{Error} = \\frac{7.20 \\, \\text{mg/kg} - 9.60 \\, \\text{mg/kg}}{9.60 \\, \\text{mg/kg}} = \\frac{-2.40}{9.60} = -0.250$$\n\nAlternatively, we can reason more generally. The reported concentration, $C_{reported}$, is derived from the apparent mass of analyte, while the true concentration, $C_{true}$, is derived from the true mass.\n$$C_{reported} \\propto m_{pesticide, apparent}$$\n$$C_{true} \\propto m_{pesticide, true} = \\frac{m_{pesticide, apparent}}{\\eta}$$\nTherefore, the relationship between the reported and true concentrations is:\n$$C_{reported} = C_{true} \\times \\eta$$\nSubstituting this into the error formula:\n$$\\text{Error} = \\frac{(C_{true} \\times \\eta) - C_{true}}{C_{true}} = \\frac{C_{true}(\\eta - 1)}{C_{true}} = \\eta - 1$$\nGiven $\\eta = 0.750$:\n$$\\text{Error} = 0.750 - 1 = -0.250$$\nThis confirms our result.
