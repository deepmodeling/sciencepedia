The method is colorimetric, meaning the presence of the pesticide produces a colored compound whose concentration can be measured by its absorbance of light in a spectrophotometer.

The goal is to determine if a specific chemical accelerant is present. The analytical method has been previously validated, and its performance characteristics are well-established.\n\nThe chemist first establishes the baseline by analyzing several blank samples (identical debris matrix known to be free of the accelerant). These blanks produce an average signal, $\\bar{S}_{blank}$, with some statistical variation.
