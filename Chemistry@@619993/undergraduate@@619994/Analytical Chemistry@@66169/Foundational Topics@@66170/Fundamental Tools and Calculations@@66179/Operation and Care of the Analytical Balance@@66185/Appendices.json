This chapter specifies a criterion for the minimum weighable quantity on an analytical balance. The rule states that a weighing is acceptable only if twice the repeatability standard deviation of the balance, $s$, divided by the nominal mass being weighed, $m$, does not exceed a specified relative tolerance, $T$.

The criterion is given by the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{2s}{m} \\le T\n$$\nwhere $s$ is the repeatability standard deviation, $m$ is the mass being weighed, and $T$ is the allowed relative tolerance.\n\nThe minimum weighable quantity, $m_{min}$, is the smallest mass that satisfies this condition. This occurs at the limit where the expression equals the tolerance:\n$$\n\\frac{2s}{m_{min}} = T\n$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $m_{min}$:\n$$\nm_{min} = \\frac{2s}{T}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Repeatability standard deviation, $s = 0.00015$ g.\n- Relative tolerance, $T = 0.10\\%$.\n\nWe must first convert the tolerance from a percentage to a decimal fraction:\n$$\nT = 0.10\\% = \\frac{0.10}{100} = 0.0010\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of $s$ and $T$ into the equation for $m_{min}$:\n$$\nm_{min} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.00015 \\text{ g}}{0.0010} = \\frac{0.00030 \\text{ g}}{0.0010} = 0.30 \\text{ g}\n$$\nThis is the minimum mass of $KMnO_4$ that can be weighed to be compliant with the guideline.\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the solution that requires this minimum mass of solute. The relationship between the mass of a solute ($m$), the concentration of the solution ($C$), the volume of the solution ($V$), and the molar mass of the solute ($M$) is:\n$$\nm = C \\times V \\times M\n$$\n\nTo find the minimum volume, $V_{min}$, that can be prepared, we set the required mass $m$ equal to the minimum weighable quantity $m_{min}$:\n$$\nm_{min} = C \\times V_{min} \\times M\n$$\n\nWe can now solve for $V_{min}$:\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{m_{min}}{C \\times M}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Target concentration, $C = 0.02000$ mol/L.\n- Molar mass of $KMnO_4$, $M = 158.034$ g/mol.\n- We have calculated $m_{min} = 0.30$ g.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $V_{min}$:\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{0.30 \\text{ g}}{(0.02000 \\text{ mol/L}) \\times (158.034 \\text{ g/mol})}\n$$\n\n$$\nV_{min} = \\frac{0.30 \\text{ g}}{3.16068 \\text{ g/L}} \\approx 0.094916 \\text{ L}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in milliliters (mL).

The limiting values in the calculation are $s$ (0.00015 g) and $T$ (0.10%), both of which have two significant figures. This makes our calculated $m_{min}$ of $0.30$ g have two significant figures.
