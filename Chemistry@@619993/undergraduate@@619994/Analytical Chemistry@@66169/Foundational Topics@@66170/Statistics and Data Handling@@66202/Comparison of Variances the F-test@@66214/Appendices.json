The team is debating whether to use a simple \"reagent blank\" (the mobile phase solvent) or a more complex \"matrix blank\" (the oral suspension formulation without Compound Z) for this purpose. The choice depends on whether the complex matrix introduces significant additional variability compared to the simple solvent.\n\nTo investigate this, two sets of blank samples were prepared and analyzed.\n1.  **Reagent Blank**: Eleven replicate injections ($n_R = 11$) of the pure mobile phase were analyzed, yielding a sample standard deviation of the instrument signal of $s_R = 0.085$ micro-absorbance units.\n2.  **Matrix Blank**: Nine replicate injections ($n_M = 9$) of the pediatric oral suspension formulation (without Compound Z) were analyzed, yielding a sample standard deviation of the instrument signal of $s_M = 0.142$ micro-absorbance units.\n\nYou are asked to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the variances of the two blank populations at the 95% confidence level.

Curve B is prepared by spiking the same standards into extracted human plasma, a significantly more complex matrix.\n\nFor both sets of standards, the instrumental response is measured, and a simple linear regression model of Response vs. Concentration is fitted to the data. The summary statistics from the two regression analyses are as follows:\n\n*   **Curve A (Clean Matrix):** Number of calibration points, $n_A=8$; Sum of Squared Residuals, $SSR_A = 0.0416$.\n*   **Curve B (Complex Matrix):** Number of calibration points, $n_B=10$; Sum of Squared Residuals, $SSR_B = 0.1512$.\n\nThe Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR) is defined as $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$, where $y_i$ is the observed instrumental response for the $i$-th standard and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the response predicted by the linear regression line.\n\nThe chemist wants to test the hypothesis that the complex plasma matrix introduces a significantly larger amount of random measurement error compared to the clean solvent. This is equivalent to comparing the variances of the random errors around the respective regression lines.
