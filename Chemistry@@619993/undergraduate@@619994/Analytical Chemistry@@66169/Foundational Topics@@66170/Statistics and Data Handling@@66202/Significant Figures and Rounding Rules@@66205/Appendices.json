This first practice focuses on a fundamental operation: unit conversion. By converting a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, you will apply the core rule for handling precision in addition and subtraction, which is governed by the number of decimal places, not the total number of significant figures [@problem_id:1472234].

Before starting the reaction, the student must record the initial temperature of the system. The digital thermometer provides a stable reading of $21.85\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. For all subsequent thermodynamic calculations, this temperature must be converted to the absolute Kelvin scale. The relationship between degrees Celsius ($T_C$) and Kelvin ($T_K$) is given by the equation $T_K = T_C + 273.15$.\n\nWhat value for the temperature, in Kelvin, should the student record and use in their calculations to properly reflect the precision of their measurement?", "solution": "The absolute temperature in Kelvin is obtained from the Celsius reading using the linear relation\n$$T_{K}=T_{C}+273.15.$$\nSubstituting the measured value $T_{C}=21.85$ gives\n$$T_{K}=21.85+273.15=295.00.$$\nFor addition, the appropriate precision is determined by the number of decimal places; both terms are specified to the hundredth, so the result must be reported to the hundredth.

The key challenge here is to correctly navigate between the rules for addition (to find total mass) and division (to calculate density), a critical skill for properly reporting a final value.", "problem": "In a laboratory, a student is tasked with preparing a saline solution. The student carefully weighs a sample of sodium chloride (NaCl) and finds its mass to be 12.4 g. This salt is then dissolved completely in a beaker containing 375.18 g of pure, deionized water. Using a graduated cylinder, the student measures the final volume of the resulting solution to be 381.5 mL.\n\nBased on these experimental measurements, calculate the density of the saline solution. Express your answer in g/mL, ensuring it reflects the correct number of significant figures determined by the precision of the measurements.", "solution": "The problem asks for the density of a saline solution prepared by dissolving a known mass of sodium chloride in a known mass of water, resulting in a measured final volume. The key to this problem is the correct application of the rules for significant figures during calculations involving addition and division.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass of the solution. The total mass is the sum of the mass of the solute (NaCl) and the mass of the solvent (water).\n$$ m_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\text{NaCl}} + m_{\\text{water}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ m_{\\text{total}} = 12.4 \\text{ g} + 375.18 \\text{ g} = 387.58 \\text{ g} $$\n\nWhen adding or subtracting measured quantities, the result must be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places.\n- The mass of NaCl, $12.4$ g, has one decimal place.\n- The mass of water, $375.18$ g, has two decimal places.\nTherefore, the sum must be rounded to one decimal place. The unrounded sum is $387.58$ g. Rounding this to one decimal place gives $387.6$ g. This rounded mass has four significant figures. This step determines the number of significant figures for the mass in the subsequent density calculation.\n\nNext, we calculate the density ($\\rho$) of the solution. Density is defined as mass per unit volume.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{m_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{solution}}} $$\nIt is best practice to use the unrounded value for the mass in the intermediate calculation and then apply the significant figure rules at the final step. The number of significant figures in our mass is four (from $387.6$ g), and the number of significant figures in our volume, $381.5$ mL, is also four.\n\nWhen multiplying or dividing measured quantities, the result must be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures.\n- Total mass ($m_{\\text{total}}$) has 4 significant figures.\n- Solution volume ($V_{\\text{solution}}$) has 4 significant figures.\nTherefore, the final answer for the density must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\nLet's perform the division using the unrounded mass for better accuracy before the final rounding:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{387.58 \\text{ g}}{381.5 \\text{ mL}} \\approx 1.01593709... \\text{ g/mL} $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.016$.\n\nTherefore, the density of the saline solution, reported to the correct number of significant figures, is $1.016$ g/mL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.016}$$", "id": "1472262"}, {"introduction": "Analytical procedures frequently involve multiple sequential steps, such as preparing a standard solution through serial dilution.
