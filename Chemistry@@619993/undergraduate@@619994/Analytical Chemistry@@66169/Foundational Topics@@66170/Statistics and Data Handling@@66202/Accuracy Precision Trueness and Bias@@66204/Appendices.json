This problem [@problem_id:1423555] explores the impact of a systematic error introduced during the calibration phase of an analysis. Through this hypothetical scenario, you will see how a consistent procedural flaw can compromise trueness, leading to a biased result, while leaving the precision of the measurements deceptively unaffected.", "problem": "An analytical chemistry student is tasked with determining the concentration of caffeine in an energy drink using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. To do this, the student must first prepare a series of calibration standards by diluting a certified 100.0 mg/L caffeine stock solution. For all dilutions, the student uses a single 10.00 mL Class A volumetric pipette, which is intended to deliver 10.00 mL of solution. However, due to a manufacturing defect, this specific pipette consistently delivers 9.90 mL.\n\nThe student plots the measured absorbance of each standard against its *calculated nominal concentration* (i.e., the concentration they *thought* they prepared) to generate a calibration curve. They then use this calibration curve to determine the caffeine concentration in an unknown sample of the energy drink, which was prepared for analysis without using the faulty pipette.\n\nFor the purpose of this question, assume the following definitions:\n*   **Trueness:** The closeness of agreement between the average of a large series of test results and the accepted reference value. Poor trueness is indicative of systematic error (bias).\n*   **Precision:** The closeness of agreement among a series of independent test results obtained under stipulated conditions. Poor precision is indicative of large random error.\n\nGiven this scenario, which of the following statements best describes the effect of using the faulty pipette for the calibration standards on the final reported concentration of caffeine in the unknown sample?\n\nA. The trueness of the result will be poor, and the precision will be poor.\n\nB. The trueness of the result will be good, but the precision will be poor.\n\nC. The trueness of the result will be poor, but the precision will be unaffected.\n\nD. The trueness of the result will be good, and the precision will be unaffected.\n\nE. Both the trueness and precision of the result will be unaffected.", "solution": "Let's analyze the effect of the systematic error introduced by the faulty pipette on the calibration process and the subsequent analysis of the unknown.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Nature of the Error**\nThe volumetric pipette consistently delivers 9.90 mL instead of its stated 10.00 mL. This is a systematic error, not a random one. The volume is consistently low by a fixed percentage:\n$$\n\\text{Error Percentage} = \\frac{10.00 \\, \\text{mL} - 9.90 \\, \\text{mL}}{10.00 \\, \\text{mL}} \\times 100\\% = 1.0\\%\n$$\nThis means every standard solution prepared using this pipette will have an actual concentration that is 1.0% lower than the student's calculated nominal concentration.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Effect on the Calibration Curve**\nThe Beer-Lambert Law states a linear relationship between absorbance ($A$) and concentration ($C$):\n$$\nA = \\epsilon b C\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity and $b$ is the path length. Let's combine these constants into a single proportionality constant, $k = \\epsilon b$.\n$$\nA = k C_{\\text{true}}\n$$\nThe student prepares standards and calculates their concentrations assuming the pipette delivers 10.00 mL. We can call this the nominal concentration, $C_{\\text{nominal}}$. However, the true concentration, $C_{\\text{true}}$, is lower because less volume of the stock solution was used in the dilution. The relationship between the true and nominal concentrations is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{true}} = C_{\\text{nominal}} \\times \\frac{9.90 \\, \\text{mL}}{10.00 \\, \\text{mL}} = 0.99 C_{\\text{nominal}}\n$$\nThe student plots Absorbance ($A$) versus *nominal* concentration ($C_{\\text{nominal}}$). The relationship on their graph is:\n$$\nA = k C_{\\text{true}} = k (0.99 C_{\\text{nominal}})\n$$\nThe slope of the calibration curve, $m$, is defined as $\\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta C}$. The student calculates the slope from their graph as $m_{\\text{student}} = \\frac{A}{C_{\\text{nominal}}}$. Substituting the expression for $A$:\n$$\nm_{\\text{student}} = \\frac{k(0.99 C_{\\text{nominal}})}{C_{\\text{nominal}}} = 0.99k\n$$\nThe true slope of the calibration should be $k$. The student's calibration curve has a slope that is systematically 1% lower than the true slope.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Effect on the Unknown Sample's Concentration**\nThe student measures the absorbance of the unknown sample, $A_{\\text{unknown}}$. The unknown was prepared correctly, so its absorbance is related to its true concentration, $C_{\\text{unknown, true}}$, by the correct relationship:\n$$\nA_{\\text{unknown}} = k C_{\\text{unknown, true}}\n$$\nTo find the concentration, the student uses their flawed calibration curve:\n$$\nC_{\\text{unknown, reported}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{unknown}}}{m_{\\text{student}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{\\text{unknown}}$ and $m_{\\text{student}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{unknown, reported}} = \\frac{k C_{\\text{unknown, true}}}{0.99k} = \\frac{1}{0.99} C_{\\text{unknown, true}} \\approx 1.01 C_{\\text{unknown, true}}\n$$\nThis shows that the reported concentration will be systematically and consistently about 1% higher than the true concentration.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Impact on Trueness and Precision**\n*   **Trueness:** Trueness measures how close the experimental result is to the true value. Since the reported concentration is consistently higher than the true value, there is a clear systematic error, or bias. Therefore, the trueness of the result is **poor**.\n\n*   **Precision:** Precision measures the reproducibility or scatter of a set of measurements. The error introduced by the pipette is systematic; it affects every measurement in the same way (shifting the result up by about 1%). It does not increase the random variation or scatter among replicate measurements of the unknown. If the student were to measure the unknown multiple times, the results would cluster tightly together, but around a value that is 1% too high. Thus, the precision is **unaffected** by this specific systematic error.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe faulty pipette introduces a systematic error that leads to a biased result (poor trueness), but it does not affect the random error or scatter of the measurements (precision is unaffected).
