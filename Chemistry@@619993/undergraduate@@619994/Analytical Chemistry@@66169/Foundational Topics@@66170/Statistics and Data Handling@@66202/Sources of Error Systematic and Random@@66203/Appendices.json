The soil is heterogeneous, containing small, inert pebbles that are free of the contaminant. Two different analytical protocols are tested, each involving five replicate measurements on subsamples drawn from the same batch.\n\n**Protocol A:** Five subsamples are taken directly from the soil batch. The mass of each subsample is measured, and the contaminant concentration is determined. Due to the random inclusion of pebbles in some subsamples but not others, the results are expected to show variability. The measured concentrations in parts per million (ppm) are:\n$45.2, 51.5, 43.8, 53.1, 46.4$\n\n**Protocol B:** The soil batch is first sieved to remove all pebbles, creating a much more homogeneous powder. Five subsamples are then taken from this sieved powder for analysis. However, the analytical instrument used has a calibration issue that introduces a consistent, positive systematic error into every measurement. The measured concentrations in parts per million (ppm) are:\n$55.1, 54.8, 55.3, 54.9, 55.4$\n\nCalculate the ratio of the sample standard deviation of the results from Protocol A to the sample standard deviation of the results from Protocol B.

This represents a significant source of systematic error, as the measured composition changes during the analysis.\n\nTo correct for this error, the chemist performs a time-resolved experiment, acquiring a series of spectra over time and measuring the ratio of the signal intensities, $R(t) = I_{Cu(I)} / I_{Cu(II)}$, at different exposure times, $t$.
