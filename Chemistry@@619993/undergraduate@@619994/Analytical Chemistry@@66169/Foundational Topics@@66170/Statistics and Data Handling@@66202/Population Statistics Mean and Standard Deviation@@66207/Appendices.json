To validate their measurement protocol, the student must analyze a Certified Reference Material (CRM). This CRM is a substance with a very accurately and precisely known concentration of a particular element.\n\nFor this exercise, the CRM has a certified population mean ($\\mu$) concentration of copper of $12.72$ parts per million (ppm). From extensive testing across many laboratories, the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) associated with this measurement is known to be $0.25$ ppm. The student performs a single, careful measurement of the CRM and obtains a copper concentration ($x$) of $13.35$ ppm.\n\nTo determine if this result is statistically consistent with the certified values, calculate the z-score. The z-score quantifies the number of standard deviations a single data point is from the population mean.
