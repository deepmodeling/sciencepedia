The sensor provides a reading of $pH = 4.50 \\pm 0.80$. The relationship between pH and the molar concentration of hydronium ions, $[H^+]$, is given by the equation $[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$. Due to the large uncertainty and the highly non-linear nature of the pH scale, standard linear error propagation methods (which are based on a first-order Taylor expansion) are inadequate for this situation and can lead to physically meaningless results.\n\nYour task is to determine the physically realistic confidence interval for the hydronium ion concentration by directly evaluating the function at the extremes of the input uncertainty range.

The standard linear error propagation formula, $\\delta f = |f'(x)| \\delta x$, assumes the function $f(x)$ is approximately linear over the interval $x \\pm \\delta x$. However, the function relating pH to $[H^+]$ is $f(pH) = [H^+] = 10^{-pH}$, which is an exponential function and is highly non-linear. Applying the linear approximation over a large input interval like $\\pm 0.80$ pH units would yield an inaccurate and symmetric uncertainty interval for $[H^+]$, which is not appropriate for an exponential relationship.\n\nThe correct and more fundamental method is to determine the range of possible pH values and then calculate the corresponding range for $[H^+]$ by applying the function to the endpoints of the pH interval.\n\nFirst, let's define the minimum and maximum possible pH values based on the measurement and its uncertainty.\nThe central value is $pH_{central} = 4.50$.\nThe uncertainty is $\\delta(pH) = 0.80$.\n\nThe lower bound of the pH interval is:\n$pH_{min} = pH_{central} - \\delta(pH) = 4.50 - 0.80 = 3.70$\n\nThe upper bound of the pH interval is:\n$pH_{max} = pH_{central} + \\delta(pH) = 4.50 + 0.80 = 5.30$\n\nSo, the true pH value is expected to lie within the interval $[3.70, 5.30]$.\n\nNow, we use the relationship $[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$ to find the corresponding interval for the hydronium ion concentration. Note that because of the negative sign in the exponent, the function is monotonically decreasing.
