The first step is to determine the initial number of moles of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) from the acid and hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) from the base.\n\nSince HBr is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water:\n$HBr(aq) \\rightarrow H^+(aq) + Br^-(aq)$\nThe number of moles of $H^+$ is equal to the number of moles of HBr.

We convert the volume of the KOH solution from milliliters to liters:\n$V_{KOH} = 21.50 \\text{ mL} = 0.02150 \\text{ L}$\nNow, we calculate the moles of $OH^-$:\n$n_{OH^-} = \\text{Concentration} \\times \\text{Volume} = (0.110 \\text{ mol/L}) \\times (0.02150 \\text{ L}) = 0.002365 \\text{ mol}$\n\nWhen the solutions are mixed, the $H^+$ and $OH^-$ ions react in a neutralization reaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry:\n$H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow H_2O(l)$\nWe need to determine which ion is the limiting reactant by comparing the number of moles.\n$n_{H^+} = 0.0031875 \\text{ mol}$\n$n_{OH^-} = 0.002365 \\text{ mol}$\nSince $n_{H^+} > n_{OH^-}$, the hydroxide ion ($OH^-$) is the limiting reactant, and the hydrogen ion ($H^+$) is in excess.
