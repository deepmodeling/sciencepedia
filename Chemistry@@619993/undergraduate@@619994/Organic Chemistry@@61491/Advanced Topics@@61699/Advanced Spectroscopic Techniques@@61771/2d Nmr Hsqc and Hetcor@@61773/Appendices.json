This requires correlating the $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR signal data with the $^{1}\\text{H}$ chemical shifts of the HSQC cross-peaks.\n\nFirst, we analyze the $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR data provided for 1-propanol (CH₃CH₂CH₂OH).\nThe structure of 1-propanol has four distinct types of protons: the three protons of the methyl group ($\\text{-CH}_3$), the two protons of the central methylene group ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$), the two protons of the methylene group attached to the oxygen ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$), and the single proton of the hydroxyl group ($\\text{-OH}$).\n\nWe can assign each signal in the $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum based on its integration, multiplicity, and chemical shift.\n\n*   **Signal P4** at δ = 0.92 ppm has an integration of 3H. The only group in 1-propanol with three protons is the methyl ($\\text{-CH}_3$) group. Its upfield chemical shift is consistent with its position, furthest from the electronegative oxygen atom. The multiplicity is a triplet, which is consistent with being coupled to the two adjacent protons of the $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$ group (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). Thus, Signal P4 corresponds to the $\\text{-CH}_3$ protons.\n\n*   **Signal P2** at δ = 2.25 ppm has an integration of 1H. This uniquely identifies it as the hydroxyl ($\\text{-OH}$) proton. Its characteristic broad singlet appearance is due to chemical exchange and lack of coupling to adjacent protons on carbon under typical conditions.\n\n*   **Signal P1** at δ = 3.58 ppm has an integration of 2H. Its downfield chemical shift is characteristic of protons on a carbon atom directly bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen. This signal must therefore correspond to the protons of the $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group. Its triplet multiplicity is due to coupling with the adjacent two protons of the central $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$ group (n+1 rule: 2+1=3).\n\n*   **Signal P3** at δ = 1.60 ppm has an integration of 2H. This signal must correspond to the protons of the remaining central methylene ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$) group. Its chemical shift is intermediate between the $\\text{-CH}_3$ and $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$ groups. It is adjacent to a 3-proton group ($\\text{-CH}_3$) and a 2-proton group ($\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$), so it is coupled to a total of 5 protons. The predicted multiplicity is a sextet (n+1 rule: 5+1=6), which matches the experimental data.\n\nSummary of $^{1}\\text{H}$ signal assignments and their integrations:\n*   Signal P1 (δ = 3.58 ppm) corresponds to the $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{OH}$ protons, so it represents 2H.\n*   Signal P2 (δ = 2.25 ppm) corresponds to the $\\text{-OH}$ proton, representing 1H.\n*   Signal P3 (δ = 1.60 ppm) corresponds to the central $\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-}$ protons, representing 2H.\n*   Signal P4 (δ = 0.92 ppm) corresponds to the $\\text{-CH}_3$ protons, representing 3H.\n\nNext, we analyze the HSQC data. An HSQC spectrum shows a cross-peak at the coordinates corresponding to the chemical shifts of a proton and the carbon to which it is directly attached. We can use the $^{1}\\text{H}$ chemical shift coordinate of each cross-peak to identify which $^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR signal it corresponds to.\n\n*   **Cross-peak X** is at ($^{1}\\text{H}$: 3.58 ppm, $^{13}\\text{C}$: 64.5 ppm). The $^{1}\\text{H}$ chemical shift of 3.58 ppm matches Signal P1. Signal P1 has an integration of 2H. Therefore, Cross-peak X is associated with 2 protons.\n\n*   **Cross-peak Y** is at ($^{1}\\text{H}$: 1.60 ppm, $^{13}\\text{C}$: 25.9 ppm). The $^{1}\\text{H}$ chemical shift of 1.60 ppm matches Signal P3. Signal P3 has an integration of 2H. Therefore, Cross-peak Y is associated with 2 protons.\n\n*   **Cross-peak Z** is at ($^{1}\\text{H}$: 0.92 ppm, $^{13}\\text{C}$: 10.5 ppm). The $^{1}\\text{H}$ chemical shift of 0.92 ppm matches Signal P4. Signal P4 has an integration of 3H. Therefore, Cross-peak Z is associated with 3 protons.\n\nNote that there is no cross-peak corresponding to the $\\text{-OH}$ proton (Signal P2, δ = 2.25 ppm) because it is not attached to a carbon atom.\n\nCombining our findings, we get the following assignments for the number of protons for each cross-peak:\n*   Cross-peak X: 2H\n*   Cross-peak Y: 2H\n*   Cross-peak Z: 3H\n\nComparing this result with the given multiple-choice options, we find that option C matches our derived assignment.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2151048"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise serves as a capstone, challenging you to apply your accumulated knowledge to a common scenario in organic chemistry: determining the structure of an unknown compound.
