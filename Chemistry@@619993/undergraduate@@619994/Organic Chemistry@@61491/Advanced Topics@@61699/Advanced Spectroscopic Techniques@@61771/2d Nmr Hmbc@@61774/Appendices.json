The ethyl group is attached at the C-2 position. The carbons of the ethyl group are labeled C-1' for the methylene carbon ($-\\text{CH}_2-$) and C-2' for the terminal methyl carbon ($-\\text{CH}_3$).

One-bond correlations $^1J_{\\text{CH}}$ are suppressed in HMBC and are instead observed in HSQC-type experiments.\n\nIn 2-ethylpyridine with the ethyl substituent at C-2, the key connectivities are:\n- H-1' is attached to C-1', and C-1' is directly bonded to the ring carbon C-2.\n- H-2' is attached to C-2', which is bonded to C-1', which is bonded to C-2.\n\nEvaluate each option by counting bonds from the proton to the carbon:\n- Option A: H-1' to C-2. Path: H-1'–C-1' (one bond), C-1'–C-2 (second bond). This is a two-bond correlation, $^2J_{\\text{CH}}$, which is optimal for HMBC and directly confirms that the methylene is attached to C-2. This is the most structurally diagnostic correlation for the point of attachment.\n- Option B: H-1' to C-1'. Path: H-1'–C-1' (one bond). This is a $^1J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation, typically suppressed in HMBC, and not informative for attachment site in this experiment.\n- Option C: H-2' to C-2. Path: H-2'–C-2' (one), C-2'–C-1' (two), C-1'–C-2 (three). This is a three-bond correlation, $^3J_{\\text{CH}}$, which can be observed in HMBC and supports attachment but is generally less direct than the $^2J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation in Option A.\n- Option D: H-1' to C-4.

This is a four-bond pathway, $^4J_{\\text{CH}}$, typically weak or absent in standard HMBC and not reliable for assignment.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and structurally informative HMBC correlation confirming attachment at C-2 is the $^2J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation between H-1' and C-2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2150832"}, {"introduction": "Often, a one-dimensional ${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum contains multiple signals of the same multiplicity, such as several singlets for different methyl groups, making their assignment ambiguous. HMBC provides a clear solution by relating these protons to distant, but structurally informative, carbon atoms like carbonyls [@problem_id:2150805].

The HMBC experiment is designed to show correlations between protons and carbons that are separated by multiple bonds, typically two or three.

There are three methyl groups: one acetyl methyl directly attached to the carbonyl ($\\text{CO–CH}_3$) and two geminal methyls attached to the quaternary vinylic carbon of the $\\text{C=C}$ bond.\n\nRecall the HMBC principle: it shows long-range heteronuclear correlations via ${}^nJ_{\\text{CH}}$ with $n=2$ or $n=3$ predominantly, as stated (“typically two or three”). Four-bond correlations ($n=4$) are generally weak and usually not observed under standard HMBC conditions.\n\nCount the number of bonds from each methyl group’s protons to the carbonyl carbon:\n- For the acetyl methyl ($\\text{CO–CH}_3$): the path H–C(methyl)–C(carbonyl) involves $n=2$ bonds. Therefore, a $^2J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation to the carbonyl carbon is expected and typically observed in HMBC.\n- For each geminal methyl on the double bond: the path H–C(methyl)–C(vinylic quaternary)–C(vinylic)–C(carbonyl) involves $n=4$ bonds. Therefore, only a $^4J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation to the carbonyl carbon is possible, which HMBC is not typically set to detect (“typically two or three”). Hence, these correlations are not expected under standard HMBC settings.\n\nTherefore, the key observation that enables unambiguous assignment is that only the acetyl methyl protons show an HMBC cross-peak to the carbonyl carbon, while the two geminal vinylic methyls do not.

For 1-bromopropane $\\mathrm{CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}Br}$, let $\\text{C}_1$ denote the terminal methyl carbon, $\\text{C}_2$ the internal methylene carbon, and $\\text{C}_3$ the bromomethylene carbon.

A $^3J_{\\text{CH}}$ path exists to the other methyl carbon, but because the two methyl carbons are equivalent, the only non-self, non-1-bond distinct carbon center that a methyl group can correlate to is $\\text{C}_\\text{c}$. In contrast, in 1-bromopropane the terminal methyl protons must correlate to two different, non-equivalent carbons ($\\text{C}_2$ and $\\text{C}_3$).\n- There is no methylene group present, so any HMBC feature requiring methylene protons cannot occur.\n\nEvaluate the options using these rules:\n- A: A methyl–to–brominated carbon correlation can arise via a $^3J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation in 1-bromopropane (from $\\text{C}_1$ H to $\\text{C}_3$) and via a $^2J_{\\text{CH}}$ correlation in 2-bromopropane (from methyl H to $\\text{C}_\\text{c}$), so this observation is not unique to 2-bromopropane.\n- B: If methyl protons show HMBC correlations to only one other carbon center, that matches 2-bromopropane (methyl H correlates uniquely to $\\text{C}_\\text{c}$ as the only non-equivalent carbon within two or three bonds), whereas in 1-bromopropane the terminal methyl H must correlate to two different carbons ($\\text{C}_2$ and $\\text{C}_3$). This unambiguously supports 2-bromopropane.\n- C: Protons on the brominated carbon showing correlations to two different carbons is characteristic of 1-bromopropane (CH$_{2}$Br H to $\\text{C}_2$ and $\\text{C}_1$), not 2-bromopropane (the CH–Br H correlates only to the equivalent methyl carbons, appearing as one carbon resonance).\n- D: A methylene–to–methyl correlation requires a methylene group and thus indicates 1-bromopropane; 2-bromopropane has no methylene group.\n\nTherefore, only option B would unambiguously confirm 2-bromopropane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2150824"}]}
