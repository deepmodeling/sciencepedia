For nucleophilic additions to $\\alpha$-chiral carbonyl compounds, chemists can often steer the reaction toward a specific diastereomer by carefully selecting the reaction conditions. This first exercise challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist and decide which set of reagents will best enforce a chelation-controlled pathway, as described by the Cram chelation model, over the competing non-chelation (Felkin-Anh) pathway [@problem_id:2201404]. Understanding this choice is the first step toward rationally designing stereoselective reactions.", "problem": "Consider the nucleophilic addition of a methyl group to the chiral ketone, 2-benzyloxy-3-pentanone.

Nucleophilic addition of a methyl group generates two diastereomeric tertiary alcohols. According to the Cram chelation model, high diastereoselectivity arises when a bidentate chelate forms between the metal and both the carbonyl oxygen and the $\\alpha$-alkoxy oxygen, producing a five-membered ring chelate and directing the nucleophile to one face of the carbonyl.\n\nChelation control is favored by:\n- Metals capable of strong bidentate coordination (e.g., $Mg^{2+}$, $Zn^{2+}$).\n- Ether solvents that do not disrupt internal chelation (e.g., THF, diethyl ether).\n- Avoiding conditions that either promote non-chelation (Felkin-Anh) or disrupt the chelate by competitive coordination or protic solvation.\n\nNow assess each option:\n- A. $CH_3MgBr$ in THF: Grignard reagents with $Mg^{2+}$ readily form a five-membered chelate with $\\alpha$-alkoxy carbonyls. THF is an ether solvent that permits internal chelation. This condition is classic for Cram chelation control, giving high diastereoselectivity for the chelation-controlled product.\n- B. $CH_3Li$ in diethyl ether: $Li^{+}$ is less effective at forming the stabilizing bidentate chelate; reactions of $\\alpha$-alkoxy carbonyls with organolithiums commonly follow Felkin-Anh (non-chelation) control. Thus, not optimal for the chelation product.\n- C. $NaBH_4$ in MeOH: This is hydride delivery, not methyl addition, and the protic solvent disrupts chelation. It neither installs a methyl group nor favors chelation control; thus it is inappropriate.\n- D. $CH_3MgBr$ with $CeCl_3$: Under Luche-type conditions, the Grignard is converted to an organocerium species. These conditions are well known to suppress chelation and favor non-chelation (Felkin-Anh) addition to carbonyls. Therefore, this disfavors the Cram chelation product.\n\nTherefore, the reagents and conditions expected to provide the highest diastereoselectivity in favor of the Cram chelation product are $CH_3MgBr$ in THF (option A).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2201404"}, {"introduction": "The stereochemical models we've discussed are powerful for predicting the major product of reactions under kinetic control, where the product ratio is governed by the relative speeds of competing reaction pathways. However, not all reactions are irreversible. This practice explores the crucial distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control by comparing two different additions to the same chiral aldehyde [@problem_id:2201432]. You will calculate and contrast the diastereomeric ratio from an irreversible Grignard reaction, governed by transition state energies, with that of a reversible cyanohydrin formation, determined by the relative thermodynamic stability of the final products.", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic additions to the $\\alpha$-chiral aldehyde, (S)-2-methoxypropanal. Two different reactions are performed under distinct conditions.\n\n**Reaction A (Kinetic Control):**\nThe aldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide ($MeMgBr$) in an ether solvent, followed by an acidic aqueous workup. This addition reaction is irreversible and therefore kinetically controlled. The reaction is observed to produce the two diastereomers of 3-methoxybutan-2-ol with a selectivity of 95:5, where the chelation-controlled product is the major component.\n\n**Reaction B (Thermodynamic Control):**\nIn a separate experiment, the aldehyde is treated with hydrogen cyanide ($HCN$) using a catalytic amount of potassium cyanide ($KCN$) as a base. The reaction is reversible and is allowed to proceed until equilibrium is established, placing the reaction under thermodynamic control. At the reaction temperature of $T=298.15$ K, the standard Gibbs free energy of the *syn* diastereomeric cyanohydrin product is higher than that of the *anti* diastereomer by 3.00 kJ/mol.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, the terms *syn* and *anti* refer to the relative stereochemistry of the newly formed hydroxyl group and the pre-existing methoxy group. When the main carbon backbone is drawn in a standard zigzag projection, if these two substituents point in the same general direction from the chain (e.g., both on wedges or both on dashes), the isomer is defined as *syn*. If they point in opposite directions, it is defined as *anti*.\n\nFor both reactions, the diastereomeric ratio, $dr$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the *syn* product to the concentration of the *anti* product.

The outcome is kinetically controlled, meaning the product ratio is determined by the relative rates of formation of the diastereomers, which in turn depend on the energies of the respective transition states.\n\nThe starting aldehyde has an $\\alpha$-methoxy group. The oxygen atom of this group can coordinate to the Lewis acidic magnesium ion of the Grignard reagent. This leads to the formation of a rigid five-membered chelate ring involving the magnesium ion, the carbonyl oxygen, and the methoxy oxygen. This is the basis of the Cram chelation model.\n\nIn the chelated intermediate, the aldehyde is locked into a specific conformation. The nucleophile (the methyl group from $MeMgBr$) will then attack the carbonyl carbon from the less sterically hindered face. The two faces of the carbonyl are distinguished by the other substituents on the $\\alpha$-carbon: a hydrogen atom and a methyl group. Since the hydrogen atom is much smaller than the methyl group, the attack occurs from the face bearing the hydrogen atom. This approach leads to the formation of the *syn* diastereomer, where the new hydroxyl group and the existing methoxy group have a *syn* relationship.\n\nThe problem states that the chelation-controlled product is the major component and the selectivity is 95:5. Since the chelation model predicts the *syn* product, we have:\n$$[\\text{syn}] : [\\text{anti}] = 95 : 5$$\nThe diastereomeric ratio under kinetic control, $dr_{\\text{kin}}$, is defined as the ratio of the *syn* product to the *anti* product.\n$$dr_{\\text{kin}} = \\frac{[\\text{syn}]}{[\\text{anti}]} = \\frac{95}{5} = 19$$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B and determine $dr_{\\text{th}}$.**\n\nReaction B is the reversible formation of a cyanohydrin. Since the reaction is allowed to reach equilibrium, the product ratio is determined by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the two diastereomeric products. This is a case of thermodynamic control. The diastereomeric ratio at equilibrium, $dr_{\\text{th}}$, is equal to the equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$, for the interconversion of the two products.\n\nLet's consider the equilibrium between the two diastereomers:\n$$ \\text{anti-product} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{syn-product} $$\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is $K_{eq} = \\frac{[\\text{syn}]}{[\\text{anti}]}$. By definition, this is equal to $dr_{\\text{th}}$.\n\nThe relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\\Delta G^\\circ$) for a reaction and its equilibrium constant ($K_{eq}$) is given by:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln(K_{eq}) $$\nIn our case, $\\Delta G^\\circ = G^\\circ_{syn} - G^\\circ_{anti}$ and $K_{eq} = dr_{\\text{th}}$. So,\n$$ G^\\circ_{syn} - G^\\circ_{anti} = -RT \\ln(dr_{\\text{th}}) $$\nThe problem states that the standard Gibbs free energy of the *syn* diastereomer is higher than that of the *anti* diastereomer by 3.00 kJ/mol. This means:\n$$ G^\\circ_{syn} - G^\\circ_{anti} = +3.00 \\text{ kJ/mol} = +3000 \\text{ J/mol} $$\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$ 3000 \\text{ J/mol} = -(8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1})(298.15 \\text{ K}) \\ln(dr_{\\text{th}}) $$\nNow, we solve for $\\ln(dr_{\\text{th}})$:\n$$ \\ln(dr_{\\text{th}}) = - \\frac{3000 \\text{ J/mol}}{(8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1})(298.15 \\text{ K})} $$\n$$ \\ln(dr_{\\text{th}}) \\approx - \\frac{3000}{2478.8} \\approx -1.21025 $$\nTo find $dr_{\\text{th}}$, we take the exponential of this value:\n$$ dr_{\\text{th}} = \\exp(-1.21025) \\approx 0.29813 $$\nAs expected, since the *syn* product is less stable (higher in energy), its proportion at equilibrium is smaller, and the ratio $dr_{\\text{th}}$ is less than 1.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final quotient $Q$.**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $Q = \\frac{dr_{\\text{kin}}}{dr_{\\text{th}}}$. Using the values calculated in the previous steps:\n$$ Q = \\frac{19}{0.29813} \\approx 63.729 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ Q \\approx 63.7 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63.7}$$", "id": "2201432"}, {"introduction": "Scientific models are powerful because they provide reliable predictions, but their strength is truly tested at their limits. The Cram chelation model, for example, assumes the substrate can adopt a specific conformation to form a stable chelate ring. This final, advanced problem presents a hypothetical scenario where this assumption is deliberately violated by a rigid molecular scaffold that prevents chelation [@problem_id:2201450]. To solve this, you must look past the simple \"rules\" and apply the fundamental steric and electronic principles of the non-chelating Felkin-Anh model, demonstrating a deeper understanding of what governs facial selectivity in the absence of chelation.", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying stereoselective additions to a custom-synthesized aldehyde. The aldehyde possesses a single chiral center at the $\\alpha$-position ($C_{\\alpha}$) relative to the carbonyl group. The groups attached to this alpha-carbon are a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and a bulky, rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl fragment, which we will abbreviate as '$R_{\\text{cyc}}$'.\n\nDue to the extreme steric demands of the bicyclic framework, the conformation of the molecule is rigidly locked. Specifically, the dihedral angle between the C=O bond of the aldehyde and the $C_{\\alpha}-O$ bond of the hydroxyl group is fixed at approximately 0 degrees, a *syn-periplanar* arrangement. This rigid lock also sterically prevents the formation of a five-membered Cram-type chelate between the magnesium ion of a Grignard reagent and the two oxygen atoms.\n\nThe aldehyde is treated with an excess of methylmagnesium bromide ($CH_3MgBr$) in diethyl ether, followed by a careful aqueous workup with dilute ammonium chloride. This reaction produces a mixture of two diastereomeric diol products. The two products can be described as the *syn*-diol and the *anti*-diol, where these terms refer to the relative configuration of the pre-existing and newly-formed hydroxyl groups when the $C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\text{carbonyl}}$ backbone is drawn in a planar, extended zigzag conformation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the major outcome of this reaction?\n\nA.

The aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol instead of undergoing addition.", "solution": "The substrate is an aldehyde bearing a single stereogenic center at the $\\alpha$-carbon bearing three substituents: a hydroxyl group, hydrogen, and a very large bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl fragment (abbreviated $R_{\\text{cyc}}$). This makes the aldehyde an $\\alpha$-alkoxy aldehyde. The problem states two key constraints: (i) the dihedral angle between the $C=O$ bond and the $C_{\\alpha}-O$ bond is rigidly fixed at approximately 0 degrees (syn-periplanar), and (ii) the steric environment prevents formation of a five-membered chelate between the metal and the two oxygens. Therefore, addition will proceed under non-chelating conditions.\n\nFor additions of organometallic reagents to $\\alpha$-heteroatom-substituted carbonyl compounds, two classical models compete: Cram chelation control and Felkin-Anh (non-chelation) control. Because chelation is explicitly disallowed here, the Cram chelation pathway is excluded. Under non-chelating conditions, the Felkin-Anh model governs the facial selectivity: the nucleophile approaches the carbonyl from the face opposite the largest substituent at the adjacent stereocenter to minimize steric interactions along the Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory. In this substrate, the largest substituent at $C_{\\alpha}$ is $R_{\\text{cyc}}$, by far larger than hydrogen and hydroxyl.\n\nThus, in the preferred transition state, the nucleophile approaches anti to $R_{\\text{cyc}}$. For $\\alpha$-alkoxy carbonyls, the polar Felkin-Anh rationale further disfavors approach on the same face as the electron-rich $\\alpha$-oxygen; approach opposite to the $\\alpha$-oxygen minimizes unfavorable dipole interactions in the transition state. Although the molecule is locked with the $C=O$ and $C_{\\alpha}-O$ bonds syn-periplanar (0 degrees) and cannot adopt the usual anti alignment advocated by Cornforth dipole minimization, the non-chelating facial selectivity still directs the nucleophile away from both the largest group ($R_{\\text{cyc}}$) and, by polar considerations, away from the $\\alpha$-oxygen face.\n\nAfter methyl addition to the aldehyde and aqueous workup, the product is a 1,2-diol. In the standard extended zigzag depiction of the $C_{\\alpha}-C_{\\text{carbonyl}}$ backbone, the Felkin-Anh approach anti to $R_{\\text{cyc}}$ yields the diastereomer in which the newly formed hydroxyl at the former carbonyl carbon and the pre-existing hydroxyl at $C_{\\alpha}$ are on opposite sides (the anti-1,2-diol). This outcome is the well-established prediction for non-chelation-controlled additions to $\\alpha$-alkoxy aldehydes: non-chelating conditions give the anti-1,2-diol as the major product, whereas chelation control would have led to the syn-1,2-diol.\n\nAlternative options are inconsistent with the mechanistic analysis: no reaction is implausible because aldehydes are highly reactive toward Grignard reagents; reduction to a primary alcohol does not occur with methylmagnesium bromide under these conditions; and an approximately 1:1 ratio is unlikely given the very large steric differentiation imposed by $R_{\\text{cyc}}$ and the conformational lock that prevents conformational averaging.
