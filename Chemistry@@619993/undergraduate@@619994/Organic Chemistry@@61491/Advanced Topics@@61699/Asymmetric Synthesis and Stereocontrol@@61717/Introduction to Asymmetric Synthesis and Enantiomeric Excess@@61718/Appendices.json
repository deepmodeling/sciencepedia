This exercise introduces the fundamental concept of enantiomeric excess ($ee$), a crucial metric for quantifying the purity of a chiral substance. By calculating the $ee$ from a given ratio of enantiomers, you will master the basic definition used to assess the success of an asymmetric synthesis [@problem_id:2178180].", "problem": "In the development of a new chiral catalyst for synthesizing a novel therapeutic agent, a key reaction produces a chiral center. The process, however, is not perfectly stereoselective and yields a scalemic mixture of the two possible enantiomers.
