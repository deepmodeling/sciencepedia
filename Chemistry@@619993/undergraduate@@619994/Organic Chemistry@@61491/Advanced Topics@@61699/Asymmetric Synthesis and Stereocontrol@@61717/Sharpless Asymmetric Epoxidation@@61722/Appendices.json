This problem [@problem_id:2199062] presents a scenario with a bifunctional substrate, challenging you to consider not only the desired epoxidation but also potential inhibiting interactions.

Deactivation: The Lewis acidic titanium catalyst promotes a competing polymerization pathway for the unsaturated substrate.", "solution": "This problem involves two key aspects: predicting the stereochemical outcome of the Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation (SAE) and identifying the cause of catalyst deactivation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the catalyst deactivation. The substrate, (E)-4-hydroxy-2-butenoic acid, contains both an allylic alcohol and a carboxylic acid functional group. The SAE catalyst is a Lewis acidic Ti(IV) complex. Carboxylic acids are known to be problematic in this reaction. In the basic reaction medium (containing alkoxides), the carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate. This carboxylate anion is a strong Lewis base and can coordinate tightly to the Lewis acidic titanium center, often in a bidentate fashion. This strong binding sequesters the catalyst in an inactive state, preventing it from participating in the catalytic cycle. This is a classic example of catalyst poisoning and correctly explains why the reaction is sluggish and gives a low yield.\n\nSecond, we predict the stereochemistry of the epoxide. The starting material is an (E)-alkene, and the chiral ligand is D-(−)-diethyl tartrate, which is (−)-DET. The established mnemonic for the Sharpless epoxidation gives the following result for this combination:\n*   Reaction of an (E)-alkene with (−)-DET yields the (2S,3R)-epoxide.\n\nTherefore, the major organic product expected from the reaction (if it were to proceed efficiently) is (2S,3R)-2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n\nCombining these two points, the correct option must state that the major product is (2S,3R)-2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxybutanoic acid and that the deactivation is due to the coordination of the substrate's carboxylate group to the titanium center. This corresponds to option A. Option B predicts the wrong stereoisomer. Options C, D, and E propose less likely deactivation pathways under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2199062"}, {"introduction": "Kinetic resolution is one of the most elegant applications of the Sharpless epoxidation, but it comes with its own set of challenges. This practice problem [@problem_id:2199069] explores the phenomenon of product inhibition, a common issue where the epoxide product sequesters the catalyst and halts turnover. By comparing a catalytic protocol with a stoichiometric one, you will uncover the mechanistic reasons for catalyst stalling and learn to devise strategies for successful kinetic resolutions.", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the kinetic resolution of racemic 4-methyl-1-penten-3-ol using the Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation (SAE) protocol. The goal is to isolate one enantiomer of the starting alcohol in high enantiomeric purity. Two separate experiments are conducted.\n\n**Experiment A (Catalytic Protocol):**\nThe racemic alcohol is treated with 1.5 equivalents of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant in the presence of 5 mol% titanium(IV) isopropoxide ($Ti(\\text{O}^i\\text{Pr})_4$) and 6 mol% (+)-diethyl tartrate ((+)-DET). The reaction is monitored by chiral chromatography. After an initial period of rapid conversion, the reaction rate slows drastically and effectively stops when only 35% of the starting material has been consumed. The remaining unreacted alcohol is isolated and found to have a modest enantiomeric excess.\n\n**Experiment B (Stoichiometric Protocol):**\nThe racemic alcohol is treated with 0.6 equivalents of a pre-formed complex made from 1.2 equivalents of $Ti(\\text{O}^i\\text{Pr})_4$ and 1.2 equivalents of (+)-DET, followed by the addition of TBHP. In this case, the reaction proceeds smoothly until approximately 50% of the starting material is consumed. Halting the reaction at this point and isolating the unreacted alcohol reveals it to have a very high enantiomeric excess, consistent with a successful kinetic resolution.\n\nBased on these observations, select the most accurate chemical explanation for why the stoichiometric protocol (Experiment B) is significantly more effective than the catalytic protocol (Experiment A) for this specific kinetic resolution.\n\nA) Under catalytic conditions, the TBHP oxidant causes slow decomposition of the titanium-tartrate complex. The stoichiometric reaction is complete before significant catalyst decomposition can occur, whereas the catalytic reaction is too slow and the catalyst degrades.\n\nB) The product of the epoxidation is a 2,3-epoxy alcohol, which acts as a potent bidentate ligand. In the catalytic protocol, this product binds very tightly to the titanium center, causing product inhibition and halting catalytic turnover. The stoichiometric protocol avoids this issue as there is no requirement for catalyst turnover.\n\nC) The catalytic reaction has an intrinsically low turnover frequency for this sterically hindered substrate. Using a stoichiometric amount of the reagent simply increases the overall reaction rate to a synthetically useful level, allowing it to reach 50% conversion in a reasonable time frame.\n\nD) The isopropanol produced from the titanium(IV) isopropoxide starting material competes with the allylic alcohol for binding to the catalyst in Experiment A. In Experiment B, the pre-formed complex minimizes the concentration of free isopropanol, leading to a more efficient reaction.\n\nE) In the catalytic protocol, trace amounts of water lead to the formation of inactive Ti-O-Ti oligomers. The higher concentration of the complex in the stoichiometric protocol makes the reaction less sensitive to this deactivation pathway.", "solution": "We analyze the Sharpless Asymmetric Epoxidation (SAE) as a catalytic cycle in which an allylic alcohol $S$ binds to a chiral titanium–tartrate complex to form a chelated substrate–catalyst complex, which then reacts with TBHP to deliver epoxide product $P$ and regenerate the active titanium species. In kinetic resolution, one enantiomer of $S$ reacts faster, so the ideal outcome is to stop the reaction at approximately one-half conversion to isolate the unreacted alcohol in high enantiomeric excess.\n\nThe key physical principle governing the difference between Experiment A and Experiment B is product inhibition by tight binding of the epoxy alcohol product to the titanium center. Let $[Ti]_{\\text{tot}}$ be the total titanium concentration, $[Ti]_{\\text{free}}$ the free active titanium sites, and $K_{S}$ and $K_{P}$ the equilibrium association constants for binding of $S$ and $P$, respectively. Writing the standard site-balance with competitive binding,\n$$\n[Ti]_{\\text{tot}} = [Ti]_{\\text{free}} \\left( 1 + K_{S}[S] + K_{P}[P] + \\dots \\right),\n$$\nso\n$$\n[Ti]_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{[Ti]_{\\text{tot}}}{1 + K_{S}[S] + K_{P}[P] + \\dots}.\n$$\nIf the epoxidation product is a 2,3-epoxy alcohol, it can chelate strongly to titanium (bidentate binding via the epoxide oxygen and the alcohol), which corresponds to $K_{P} \\gg K_{S}$. As $[P]$ increases during the catalytic reaction, the denominator grows rapidly, forcing $[Ti]_{\\text{free}} \\to 0$ even when substantial $[S]$ remains. The catalytic rate scales as\n$$\nv = k_{\\text{cat}} [Ti]_{\\text{free}} [S],\n$$\nso as $[P]$ builds, $v$ collapses due to the large $K_{P}[P]$ term, and the reaction can stall well before reaching one-half conversion. This explains the observation in Experiment A that the reaction effectively stops around 0.35 consumption of $S$ with only modest enrichment of the unreacted alcohol: the catalyst is trapped as $Ti\\!\\cdot\\!P$ and cannot turn over further.\n\nIn the stoichiometric protocol (Experiment B), a pre-formed titanium–tartrate complex is used in an amount on the order of the required epoxidation events (here, 0.6 equivalents relative to $S$), so the process does not rely on multiple turnovers. Even if product binding is extremely strong and the catalyst is sequestered as $Ti\\!\\cdot\\!P$ after each epoxidation event, each titanium center only needs to effect approximately one reaction to reach the target of about 0.50 consumption of $S$. In this regime, product inhibition does not prevent achieving approximately one-half conversion; it merely arrests further turnover beyond that point. Halting at about one-half conversion thus yields the unreacted alcohol with very high enantiomeric excess, consistent with successful kinetic resolution.\n\nAlternative explanations are less consistent with the data and known SAE behavior: (A) generalized TBHP-induced decomposition would not specifically induce a sharp plateau at approximately 0.35 consumption, and catalytic SAE is typically robust to TBHP under standard conditions; (C) a low intrinsic turnover frequency would slow the reaction but would not cause the abrupt stalling well below 0.50 conversion, nor explain why a stoichiometric protocol uniquely solves the problem; (D) competition from isopropanol is not uniquely mitigated by preforming the complex and is not the dominant determinant of the observed plateau; (E) water-induced Ti–O–Ti oligomerization would not be selectively bypassed by using stoichiometric amounts in a way that allows smooth progress to approximately 0.50 conversion.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is strong product inhibition by the epoxy alcohol, which blocks catalytic turnover in Experiment A, while Experiment B succeeds because it does not require turnover beyond approximately one reaction per titanium center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2199069"}]}
