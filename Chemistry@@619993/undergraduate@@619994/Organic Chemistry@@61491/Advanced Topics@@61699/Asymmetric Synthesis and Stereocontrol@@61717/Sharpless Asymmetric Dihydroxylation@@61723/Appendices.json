The standard protocol involves dissolving the alkene in a tert-butanol/water solvent system and treating it with \"AD-mix-β\". AD-mix-β is a commercially available, pre-packaged mixture of reagents containing a catalytic amount of potassium osmate ($\\text{K}_2\\text{OsO}_2(\\text{OH})_4$) as the osmium source, a stoichiometric amount of potassium ferricyanide ($\\text{K}_3[\\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_6]$) as the co-oxidant, a chiral ligand ($(\\text{DHQD})_2\\text{PHAL}$), and potassium carbonate ($\\text{K}_2\\text{CO}_3$) as a base.\n\nIn a procedural error, the student prepares a custom mixture containing all the correct components in their proper ratios *except* for the potassium carbonate, which is completely omitted.

The reaction will proceed to completion with the expected high enantioselectivity, but the overall reaction rate will be significantly slower.", "solution": "We identify the role of each component in the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) catalytic cycle under standard conditions and then deduce the effect of omitting potassium carbonate.\n\n1) Standard catalytic cycle components and roles:\n- Osmium source: potassium osmate provides the catalytically active osmium species after oxidation to an Os(VIII) tetraoxo complex coordinated by the chiral ligand. The chiral ligand controls the enantioselective approach of the alkene.\n- Co-oxidant: potassium ferricyanide reoxidizes the reduced osmium after dihydroxylation, enabling catalytic turnover.\n- Base (potassium carbonate): maintains a basic pH, which (i) converts osmium species into their anionic hydroxo forms, improving solubility and reactivity; (ii) promotes hydrolysis (cleavage) of the cyclic osmate ester to release the vicinal diol; and (iii) enables efficient reoxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII) by ferricyanide.\n\n2) Elementary steps in the AD cycle:\n- Asymmetric cycloaddition of Os(VIII) to the alkene to give a cyclic osmate ester (Os(VI)):\n$$\\text{Os}^{\\text{VIII}} + \\text{alkene} \\rightarrow \\text{osmate ester}(\\text{Os}^{\\text{VI}})$$\n- Hydrolytic cleavage of the osmate ester to release the vicinal diol and generate a hydroxo Os(VI) species; this step is base-promoted:\n$$\\text{osmate ester} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O} \\xrightarrow{\\text{base}} \\text{vicinal diol} + \\text{Os}^{\\text{VI}}(\\text{hydroxo})$$\n- Reoxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII) by ferricyanide; this step is efficient under basic conditions where the osmium exists as an anionic hydroxo complex:\n$$\\text{Os}^{\\text{VI}} + \\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_{6}^{3-} \\xrightarrow{\\text{base}} \\text{Os}^{\\text{VIII}} + \\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_{6}^{4-}$$\n\n3) Consequence of omitting potassium carbonate:\n- Without base, the hydrolysis of the osmate ester is greatly slowed or arrested, so release of the diol is inefficient. Even if hydrolysis occurs to a small extent, the reoxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII) by ferricyanide is highly inefficient in the absence of basic conditions that stabilize the necessary anionic osmium hydroxo species. Thus, catalytic turnover is effectively shut down.\n- As a result, the reaction does not proceed to completion. At most, a very small amount of diol can form corresponding to the limited, non-catalytic conversion enabled by the initially available high-valent osmium species before the cycle stalls. Because only a catalytic amount of osmium is present, the total diol formed is minimal.\n- The stereochemical outcome (enantioselectivity) is governed by the chiral ligand, not by the base; omitting base does not invert or erase enantioselection by itself. The dominant and immediate effect is failure of catalytic turnover, not a change in enantioselectivity or ligand degradation.\n\n4) Evaluation of options:\n- A is incorrect because the chiral ligand remains and enantioselection is not nullified specifically by removing base; the primary issue is turnover failure, not racemization.\n- B is incorrect because enantiomeric sense is dictated by the ligand (DHQ vs DHQD systems), not by the presence of base; removing base does not invert selectivity.\n- C is correct: absent base, hydrolysis and reoxidation steps are crippled, so oxidation is minimal and the reaction stalls after a very small, effectively stoichiometric amount relative to the initially available high-valent osmium species.\n- D is incorrect: ferricyanide does not primarily and rapidly degrade the chiral ligand upon omission of base; the immediate and significant effect is failure of the osmium reoxidation/hydrolysis sequence.\n- E is incorrect: the reaction does not simply slow; it fails to achieve catalytic turnover and will not proceed to completion.\n\nTherefore, the most significant and immediate chemical consequence of omitting potassium carbonate is that the oxidation of the alkene is minimal and the reaction effectively halts after a very small, stoichiometric yield of diol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2198810"}, {"introduction": "While the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation is renowned for its high enantioselectivity, real-world laboratory conditions can sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes.

Under prolonged exposure to excess oxidant (NMO) and base ($\\text{K}_{2}\\text{CO}_{3}$), vicinal diols are susceptible to further oxidation by the $OsO_{4}$/NMO system. The relevant chemical principle is oxidative dehydrogenation of vicinal diols to carbonyl derivatives: a 1,2-diol $R^{1}\\text{CH(OH)CH(OH)}R^{2}$ can be oxidized to the $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone $R^{1}\\text{COCH(OH)}R^{2}$ (an acyloin), and with further oxidation potentially to the $\\alpha$-diketone.\n\nStep 1: Identify the immediate over-oxidation product from the chiral diol.\nHydrobenzoin (1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol) under $OsO_{4}$/NMO and base is known to oxidize to the corresponding $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone (benzoin, 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone). This step removes hydrogen from one of the alcohols to form a carbonyl adjacent to the remaining hydroxyl group.\n\nStep 2: Explain why this intermediate leads to racemization.\nThe $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone has its stereocenter at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, which is $\\alpha$ to the carbonyl. Under basic conditions, $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketones undergo enolization (or enolate formation) at this stereocenter, passing through a planar enol/enolate intermediate. Because the intermediate is achiral (planar at the reactive center), reprotonation is not stereospecific and yields racemic $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone. Thus, the $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone derived from the enantioenriched diol racemizes under the basic, oxidative conditions.\n\nStep 3: Connect back to the observed diol racemization.\nOnce racemized benzoin is present, re-conversion to the diol under the reaction conditions (e.g., via hydration and subsequent reduction-like steps in the catalytic environment, or via non-stereoselective addition across the transient enol/enediol) occurs without stereochemical control, delivering hydrobenzoin with degraded enantiomeric excess. Therefore, the $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone is the key intermediate most directly responsible for the observed racemization because it both forms readily from the diol under the conditions and racemizes via enolization, and it can be converted back to the diol non-stereoselectively.\n\nStep 4: Exclude the other options.\n- Epoxide (B): Not formed from the diol under $OsO_{4}$/NMO; epoxidation pertains to alkenes, and diol-to-epoxide formation is not operative here.\n- Oxidative cleavage product benzaldehyde (C): Cleavage is not readily reversible to the diol under these conditions; it would destroy, not racemize, stereochemistry.\n- Cyclic osmate(VI) ester of the product diol (D): Such esters preserve the relative configuration and do not cause racemization; their hydrolysis is stereospecific rather than scrambling.\n- $\\alpha$-Diketone benzil (E): This is a further over-oxidation product but is not efficiently converted back to the diol under the given oxidative, basic conditions; its formation represents degradation rather than a racemizing intermediate directly equilibrating with the diol.\n\nTherefore, the key racemization-mediating intermediate is the $\\alpha$-hydroxy ketone (benzoin).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2198800"}]}
