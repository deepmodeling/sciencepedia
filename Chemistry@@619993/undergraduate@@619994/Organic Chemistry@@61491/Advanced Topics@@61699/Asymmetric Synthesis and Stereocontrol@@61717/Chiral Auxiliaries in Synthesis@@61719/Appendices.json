Once a diastereoselective reaction is complete, the resulting ratio of diastereomers directly translates into the enantiomeric excess of the final product after the auxiliary is cleaved. This practice problem [@problem_id:2159678] guides you through this crucial calculation, connecting the diastereomeric ratio ($dr$) of an intermediate to the final enantiomeric excess ($ee$) of the desired product.", "problem": "In an asymmetric synthesis designed to produce a chiral alcohol, an achiral aldehyde is first reacted with a chiral auxiliary, (S)-1-amino-2-(methoxymethyl)pyrrolidine, commonly known as SAMP. The resulting chiral hydrazone is then treated with an organolithium reagent. This sequence generates a pair of diastereomeric intermediates. After chromatographic separation is attempted, analysis reveals that the mixture contains the two diastereomers in a ratio of 98:2. This entire mixture is then subjected to an ozonolysis step, which cleaves the chiral auxiliary, yielding a mixture of the (R) and (S) enantiomers of the final alcohol product. Assuming that the cleavage of the auxiliary proceeds cleanly and does not cause any racemization or epimerization at the newly formed stereocenter, calculate the enantiomeric excess of the final alcohol mixture.\n\nProvide your answer as a decimal value, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We begin with an achiral aldehyde converted to a chiral hydrazone using a chiral auxiliary (SAMP). Subsequent addition of an organolithium reagent creates a new stereocenter, generating two diastereomeric intermediates in a ratio of 98:2. Let the amounts of these two diastereomers be proportional to 98 and 2, respectively.\n\nUpon ozonolysis, the chiral auxiliary is cleaved cleanly without racemization or epimerization at the stereocenter. Therefore, each diastereomer maps to a distinct enantiomer of the final alcohol in the same proportion. Denoting the amounts of the two enantiomers as $n_{R}$ and $n_{S}$, we have either $(n_{R}, n_{S}) = (98, 2)$ or $(2, 98)$; the enantiomeric excess depends only on the absolute difference.\n\nThe enantiomeric excess is defined by\n$$\nee = \\frac{|n_{R} - n_{S}|}{n_{R} + n_{S}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the values gives\n$$\nee = \\frac{|98 - 2|}{98 + 2} = \\frac{96}{100} = 0.96.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, this remains $0.96$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.96}$$", "id": "2159678"}, {"introduction": "The Evans oxazolidinone auxiliaries are a cornerstone of modern asymmetric synthesis, renowned for their high and predictable stereocontrol in reactions like the aldol addition. However, their true power lies in their tunability; the stereochemical outcome is exquisitely sensitive to the reaction conditions. This exercise [@problem_id:2159661] presents a scenario where a change in the Lewis acid completely inverts the stereochemical outcome, challenging you to deduce the reagent responsible and deepening your understanding of how to control the formation of *syn* versus *anti* products.", "problem": "In a typical Evans aldol reaction, the N-propionyl derivative of (4R,5S)-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone is treated with dibutylboron triflate ($Bu_2BOTf$) and a hindered amine base such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). The resulting Z-boron enolate is then reacted with an aldehyde, for example, isobutyraldehyde ((CH$_3$)$_2$CHCHO), at low temperature. This standard procedure reliably yields the *syn*-aldol adduct as the major product.\n\nAn organic chemistry student attempts to perform a similar reaction. However, upon characterization of the major product, they are surprised to find that it is the *anti*-aldol adduct, representing a complete reversal of the expected diastereoselectivity. A review of the lab notebook reveals that all reagents and conditions were standard, except for one critical substitution: a different Lewis acidic reagent was used in place of $Bu_2BOTf$ during the enolization step.\n\nWhich of the following Lewis acidic reagents, when substituted for $Bu_2BOTf$, is the most plausible cause for the formation of the *anti*-aldol product as the major isomer?\n\nA. Titanium(IV) chloride ($TiCl_4$)\n\nB. 9-Borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane triflate (9-BBN-OTf)\n\nC. Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA)\n\nD. Trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf)\n\nE. Boron trifluoride etherate ($BF_3 \\cdot OEt_2$)", "solution": "The standard Evans aldol uses $Bu_{2}BOTf$ with a hindered amine base to generate a $Z$-boron enolate of the $N$-acyloxazolidinone. The ensuing aldol addition proceeds through a Zimmerman–Traxler chair transition state in which a $Z$-enolate delivers the nucleophile and electrophile to give the *syn*-aldol as the major product.\n\nTo invert the diastereoselectivity to the *anti*-aldol product, the transition state of the reaction must be altered. This is typically achieved by changing the Lewis acid used for enolization. A well-established principle in the Evans auxiliary platform is:\n- Boron enolates, formed with reagents like $Bu_{2}BOTf$, are predominantly *Z* and react via a Zimmerman-Traxler transition state to give *syn*-aldol products.\n- Titanium-mediated reactions, using reagents like $TiCl_4$, also proceed through a *Z*-enolate, but the organization of the transition state is different, leading to the formation of *anti*-aldol products as the major isomer. This change in outcome is due to the nature of the metal center, not a switch in enolate geometry.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- A. $TiCl_{4}$ is a strong Lewis acid known to mediate the Evans *anti*-aldol reaction. Its substitution for a boron triflate is the classic method for reversing the diastereoselectivity to favor the *anti*-product.\n- B. 9-BBN-OTf is another boron triflate; it would similarly produce a $Z$-boron enolate and thus favor the *syn*-product, not *anti*.\n- C. LDA is a strong base, not a Lewis acid, and its use would generate a lithium enolate. This does not match the described “substitution of a Lewis acidic reagent” and represents a different reaction pathway.\n- D. TMSOTf is a silylating Lewis acid that would form a silyl enol ether (for a Mukaiyama aldol), not directly lead to the titanium-type *anti*-selectivity under these conditions.\n- E. $BF_{3}\\cdot OEt_{2}$ is a Lewis acid commonly used to activate electrophiles, not typically to generate the enolate in an Evans aldol, and would not enforce the known titanium-based *anti*-outcome.\n\nTherefore, substituting $TiCl_{4}$ for $Bu_{2}BOTf$ is the most plausible cause of observing the *anti*-aldol product as the major isomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2159661"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, chiral auxiliaries would be perfectly effective and fully recoverable after use.
