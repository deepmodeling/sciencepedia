Identify the directionality of solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS): In standard SPPS, the peptide is assembled from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. Therefore, the first residue attached to the resin must be the C-terminal amino acid of the target peptide.\n\n2. Determine the C-terminal residue in glycylalanine (Gly-Ala): By convention, the sequence Gly-Ala denotes glycine at the N-terminus and alanine at the C-terminus. Hence, alanine is the first residue that must be attached to the resin.\n\n3. Apply the Fmoc strategy requirement: In an Fmoc-based SPPS, the amino acid to be attached to the resin must have its alpha-amino group protected with an Fmoc group to prevent undesired reactions during attachment and subsequent coupling steps. The carboxyl group is used to form the bond to the resin’s linker.\n\n4. Evaluate the options:\n- A (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycine): Glycine is not the C-terminal residue for Gly-Ala; using this would give the wrong sequence.\n- B (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)alanine): This is alanine with an Fmoc-protected alpha-amino group, exactly the required protected C-terminal residue for Fmoc-SPPS of Gly-Ala.\n- C (N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)alanine): Boc protection is used in Boc-based strategies, not in an Fmoc-based synthesis.\n- D (Alanine): Unprotected alpha-amino group would lead to side reactions; not compatible with the Fmoc strategy requirements for the initial loading.\n- E (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycylalanine): A preformed dipeptide is not used as the first loading step in this plan, which builds residues one by one.\n\n5.

The deprotection step is crucial as it removes the temporary $N$-terminal protecting group, preparing the growing peptide chain for the addition of the next amino acid. This practice focuses on the chemical transformation that occurs during the base-mediated Fmoc deprotection, a cornerstone of modern SPPS. [@problem_id:2199554]", "problem": "In a modern automated peptide synthesizer employing Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), the C-terminus of the first amino acid is covalently attached to an insoluble polymer resin. Subsequent amino acids are added one by one to the N-terminus of the growing chain. A common strategy uses the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group to protect the N-terminus of the incoming amino acid. This protecting group must be removed before the next amino acid can be coupled.\n\nConsider the first step in the synthesis of a dipeptide. The amino acid Leucine (Leu) has been attached to the resin via its carboxyl group, and its amino group is protected with an Fmoc group. This initial species, Fmoc-Leu-Resin, is treated with a solution of piperidine to remove the Fmoc group.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions best represents the major organic product that remains covalently attached to the resin after this deprotection step is complete?\n\nA. Leucine attached to the resin, with a piperidine amide formed at the N-terminus.\n\nB. Free Leucine, which has been cleaved from the resin.\n\nC. The starting material, Fmoc-Leu-Resin, as piperidine is not a strong enough reagent for this transformation.\n\nD. Leucine attached to the resin, with a free primary amine at the N-terminus.\n\nE. Leucine attached to the resin, with a carbamic acid formed at the N-terminus.", "solution": "The initial resin-bound species is Fmoc-Leu-Resin. In standard Fmoc-based SPPS, the amino group of the resin-bound amino acid is protected as an Fmoc carbamate. The resin attachment is via the carboxyl group of leucine to a linker on the insoluble polymer; this bond is designed to be stable to base and cleaved only under acidic conditions at the end of synthesis.\n\nUpon treatment with piperidine, deprotection of the Fmoc group occurs by a base-promoted mechanism. Piperidine acts as a base to initiate the well-established Fmoc removal pathway: deprotonation at the benzylic position of the Fmoc group leads to fragmentation of the carbamate, releasing carbon dioxide and generating dibenzofulvene. The dibenzofulvene is trapped by piperidine in solution, preventing recombination. Crucially, the leucine remains attached to the resin through its carboxyl-linker bond, which is not cleaved under these basic conditions.\n\nTherefore, the functional group left on the leucine after deprotection is a free primary amine at the N-terminus, ready for the next coupling step. There is no formation of a piperidine amide at the N-terminus because there is no activated acyl species on nitrogen; there is also no carbamic acid persisting, as the transient carbamate fragments and decarboxylates under the deprotection conditions. Piperidine is the standard reagent for Fmoc removal, so the starting Fmoc species does not persist. The peptide is not cleaved from the resin by base; cleavage typically requires strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because no amide with piperidine forms at the N-terminus.\n- B is incorrect because base does not cleave the resin linker used in Fmoc-SPPS.\n- C is incorrect because piperidine is the standard and sufficient reagent for Fmoc deprotection.\n- D is correct: the product is Leu attached to the resin with a free primary amine on nitrogen.\n- E is incorrect because any carbamic acid intermediate collapses, releasing carbon dioxide, and does not remain attached.\n\nThus, the correct description is leucine attached to the resin with a free primary amine at the N-terminus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2199554"}, {"introduction": "In a real laboratory setting, simply running the reactions is not enough; we must monitor their progress to ensure success. This problem explores a common and practical challenge in SPPS: what to do when a standard analytical test gives an unexpected result. By analyzing the chemistry of both the peptide and the monitoring test itself—in this case, the Kaiser test with proline—you will develop critical troubleshooting skills essential for any synthetic chemist. [@problem_id:2199569]", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is tasked with synthesizing the tripeptide Gly-Pro-Ala using an automated Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) instrument. The synthesis begins with an Fmoc-Ala-functionalized resin (a solid polymer support). The standard SPPS cycle consists of two main steps: (1) N-terminal deprotection, where the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group is removed with a base (e.g., piperidine) to expose a free amine; and (2) coupling, where the next Fmoc-protected amino acid is activated and linked to the newly exposed amine.\n\nTo check for the completion of each deprotection step, a small sample of resin beads is subjected to the Kaiser test. This test involves heating the beads with solutions of ninhydrin, pyridine, and phenol. A successful deprotection, indicated by the presence of a free primary amine on the resin, yields a characteristic deep blue color (due to the formation of a chromophore called Ruhemann's purple). A resin with a protected N-terminus (an amide or carbamate) or no amine functionality will give a negative result (beads remain colorless or yellow).\n\nThe synthesis of the dipeptide on the resin proceeds smoothly:\n1.  Deprotection of Fmoc-Ala-Resin yields $\\text{H}_2\\text{N-Ala-Resin}$. A Kaiser test on a sample is positive (deep blue), confirming the presence of the free primary amine of alanine.\n2.  Coupling with Fmoc-Pro yields Fmoc-Pro-Ala-Resin. A Kaiser test on a sample is negative (yellow), as expected for the protected N-terminus.\n\nThe researcher then initiates the deprotection of this dipeptide to prepare for the final coupling:\n3.  The Fmoc-Pro-Ala-Resin is treated with piperidine to generate the deprotected peptide, H-Pro-Ala-Resin.\n\nUpon performing the Kaiser test on a sample of the H-Pro-Ala-Resin beads from step 3, the researcher is surprised to find that the beads turn a faint yellow-orange, not the expected deep blue. This result is typically interpreted as a failed deprotection. Assuming all reagents, solvents, and instrumental functions are correct, which of the following statements provides the best explanation for this observation and proposes the most appropriate subsequent procedure?\n\nA. The Fmoc deprotection in step 3 was incomplete due to steric hindrance, leaving most N-termini protected. The procedure should be to repeat the piperidine deprotection step for an extended time and then re-test with the Kaiser test.\n\nB. The coupling of proline in step 2 failed, so the test is detecting nothing. The procedure should be to start the synthesis over from the beginning with fresh resin.\n\nC. The N-terminal proline is a secondary amine and does not react with ninhydrin to form the blue Ruhemann's purple chromophore. The procedure should be to perform an alternative test, such as the isatin test, which gives a characteristic blue-green color for N-terminal proline, to confirm deprotection before proceeding to the next coupling step.\n\nD. The peptide bond between proline and alanine is unstable and was cleaved during the basic deprotection step. The procedure should be to cleave the resulting Ala-Resin from the support and confirm its identity using mass spectrometry.\n\nE. The Kaiser test reagents have degraded. The procedure should be to prepare fresh ninhydrin, phenol, and pyridine solutions and repeat the test on the H-Pro-Ala-Resin sample.", "solution": "The SPPS sequence described is standard: the Fmoc group is base-labile and is removed by piperidine to expose the N-terminal amine, after which the Kaiser test detects a free primary amine by formation of Ruhemann's purple in the presence of ninhydrin, pyridine, and phenol. The key chemical principle is that ninhydrin gives the characteristic deep blue chromophore only with primary amines; secondary amines do not form Ruhemann's purple and instead yield a yellow to orange color due to formation of different iminium-derived products.\n\nProline is a secondary amine (an imino acid) because its nitrogen is embedded in a pyrrolidine ring. Therefore, after deprotection of Fmoc-Pro-Ala-Resin with piperidine, the resin bears H-Pro-Ala-Resin with an N-terminal secondary amine, which is expected to give a negative or faint yellow-orange Kaiser test rather than the deep blue indicative of a primary amine. Thus, the observed faint yellow-orange is consistent with successful deprotection and the inherent limitation of the Kaiser test for secondary amines.\n\nConsequently, the correct explanation is that the Kaiser test is not suitable for detecting free N-terminal proline. The appropriate procedure is to employ an alternative test that detects secondary amines on resin, such as the isatin test, which yields a characteristic blue-green color for N-terminal proline (or alternatively, the chloranil test for secondary amines). Upon obtaining a positive isatin test, the synthesis can proceed to the next coupling (e.g., Fmoc-Gly).\n\nWhy the other options are not appropriate:\n- A: Incomplete Fmoc deprotection due to sterics is unlikely under standard piperidine conditions for Fmoc removal; moreover, even complete deprotection of proline would still not give a blue Kaiser test because the N-terminal amine is secondary. Repeating deprotection would not convert a secondary amine into a primary amine.\n- B: If proline coupling had failed, the resin would remain Fmoc-Ala-Resin; after deprotection in step 3, a free primary amine (H-Ala-Resin) would be generated, which would give a deep blue Kaiser test, contrary to observation. Additionally, a negative Kaiser test after step 2 supports successful coupling of proline.\n- D: Peptide bonds are stable to the basic conditions used for Fmoc deprotection; piperidine does not cleave the amide bond between proline and alanine under standard SPPS conditions. The observed color does not indicate bond cleavage.\n- E: The reagents are assumed correct by the problem statement, and earlier tests functioned as expected. The faint yellow-orange is the expected response with a secondary amine rather than evidence of reagent degradation.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation and next step are to recognize the limitation of the Kaiser test with secondary amines and use the isatin test to confirm deprotection before proceeding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2199569"}]}
