Two rules are paramount: the specific hydrogen-bonding between base pairs (Adenine with Thymine, Guanine with Cytosine) and the antiparallel orientation of the two strands. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to apply these foundational rules by constructing the complementary strand for a given DNA sequence [@problem_id:2185510], a skill central to nearly all of molecular biology.", "problem": "In the study of molecular biology, the structure of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is fundamental. A DNA molecule is a double helix composed of two polynucleotide chains that are complementary to each other. The building blocks of these chains are nucleotides, each containing one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). The complementarity is governed by specific base-pairing rules: Adenine pairs with Thymine, and Guanine pairs with Cytosine. Furthermore, the two strands are antiparallel, meaning they run in opposite directions. The orientation of a strand is indicated by its 5' (five prime) and 3' (three prime) ends.\n\nConsider a short, single-stranded DNA sequence that is a fragment of a gene's coding region, given as:\n`5'-ATGCAG-3'`\n\nWhich of the following options correctly represents the sequence and orientation of the complementary DNA strand?\n\nA. 3'-UACGUC-5'\n\nB. 5'-TACGTC-3'\n\nC. 3'-TACGTC-5'\n\nD. 3'-GCATGA-5'\n\nE. 5'-GCATGA-3'", "solution": "We use the DNA base-pairing rules (A pairs with T, and G pairs with C) and the fact that the two strands are antiparallel, meaning the complementary strand runs in the opposite orientation: the $5'$ end of one strand aligns with the $3'$ end of the other.\n\nStarting from the given strand 5'-ATGCAG-3', we determine the complementary bases for each position:\nA pairs with T, T pairs with A, G pairs with C, C pairs with G, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.

They can exist in rare, alternative tautomeric forms that alter their hydrogen-bonding capabilities, providing a chemical basis for spontaneous mutations. In this final practice, you will explore how the rare imino tautomer of cytosine disrupts standard pairing and instead forms a stable mispair with adenine, illustrating a key mechanism of genetic change [@problem_id:2185458].", "problem": "In the structure of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the nitrogenous bases are key to its function. The four canonical bases are Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). According to the Watson-Crick model, base pairing occurs with high fidelity: Adenine pairs with Thymine via two hydrogen bonds, and Guanine pairs with Cytosine via three hydrogen bonds. However, these bases can exist in rare tautomeric forms, which can lead to incorrect base pairing during DNA replication, a fundamental mechanism of point mutations.\n\nThe common, stable form of cytosine is the amino tautomer. Consider a rare tautomer of cytosine, the imino form, which arises when a proton from the exocyclic amino group at position 4 migrates to the ring nitrogen at position 3. This changes the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the base.

Adenine\n\nB. Guanine\n\nC. Thymine\n\nD. Cytosine", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the incorrect base-pairing partner for the rare imino tautomer of cytosine. To solve this, we must first understand the hydrogen bonding patterns of the normal bases and then analyze how the tautomeric shift in cytosine alters its ability to form hydrogen bonds.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the standard Cytosine-Guanine (C-G) pairing.**\nIn its common amino form, cytosine has the following hydrogen-bonding sites on its Watson-Crick face:\n- An acceptor at the N3 ring nitrogen (a lone pair).\n- A donor group at the exocyclic C4 amino group (-NH2).\n- An acceptor at the C2 carbonyl oxygen (C=O).\n\nGuanine, its standard partner, has complementary sites:\n- A donor at the N1 ring nitrogen (-NH).\n- An acceptor at the C6 carbonyl oxygen (C=O).\n- A donor group at the exocyclic C2 amino group (-NH2).\n\nThese align perfectly to form three specific hydrogen bonds:\n1.  Guanine(N1-H) --- (N3)Cytosine [Donor---Acceptor]\n2.  Guanine(N2-H) --- (O2)Cytosine [Donor---Acceptor]\n3.  Guanine(O6) --- (H-N4)Cytosine [Acceptor---Donor]\n\nThis D-A-D pattern on Guanine pairs with the A-D-A pattern on Cytosine.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the imino tautomer of Cytosine.**\nThe problem states that the imino tautomer (let's call it C*) is formed by the migration of a proton from the C4 amino group to the N3 ring nitrogen.\n- The exocyclic C4 group changes from an amino group (-NH2) to an imino group (=NH). This group now acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor via its nitrogen lone pair.\n- The N3 ring nitrogen, which was an acceptor, becomes protonated (-NH-) and is now a hydrogen bond donor.\n- The C2 carbonyl oxygen remains a hydrogen bond acceptor.\n\nSo, the new hydrogen-bonding pattern for the imino cytosine (C*) on its Watson-Crick face is:\n- **Donor** at N3.\n- **Acceptor** at the C4 imino nitrogen.\n- Acceptor at the C2 carbonyl oxygen.\n\nFor the purpose of standard base-pairing geometry, the most relevant sites are at positions 3 and 4. Thus, C* presents a **Donor-Acceptor** pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Test the pairing of imino-Cytosine (C*) with each canonical base.**\n\n**A. Pairing with Adenine (A):**\nAdenine's hydrogen-bonding pattern on its Watson-Crick face is:\n- An acceptor at the N1 ring nitrogen.\n- A donor at the exocyclic C6 amino group (-NH2).\nThis is an **Acceptor-Donor** pattern.\n\nLet's align C* and A:\n1.  C*(N3-H) --- (N1)Adenine [Donor---Acceptor]\n2.  C*(N4) --- (H-N6)Adenine [Acceptor---Donor]\n\nThis alignment results in two stable hydrogen bonds, forming a C*-A pair that is sterically similar to a standard Watson-Crick A-T or G-C pair. This is a very strong candidate for a stable mispair.\n\n**B. Pairing with Guanine (G):**\nGuanine's pattern is Donor-Acceptor (from N1 and O6 sites).\n- C*(N3-H) would face Guanine(N1-H). This is a [Donor---Donor] repulsion.\nNo stable pairing is possible in the standard geometry.\n\n**C. Pairing with Thymine (T):**\nThymine's pattern is Acceptor-Donor-Acceptor (from C4=O, N3-H, C2=O). Focusing on the main pairing sites:\n- C*(N3-H) would face Thymine(N3-H). This is a [Donor---Donor] repulsion.\nNo stable pairing is possible.\n\n**D. Pairing with Cytosine (C):**\nThe normal amino-cytosine's pattern is Acceptor-Donor (from N3 and N4 sites).\n- C*(N3-H) could pair with C(N3). This is a [Donor---Acceptor] bond.\n- C*(N4) could pair with C(N4-H). This is an [Acceptor---Donor] bond.\nHowever, this symmetric C*-C pairing can be sterically hindered and is generally less favored than the C*-A pairing which mimics the geometry of a standard purine-pyrimidine pair. The C*-A pair fits perfectly within the DNA double helix dimensions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy changing its tautomeric form from amino to imino, cytosine alters its hydrogen-bonding pattern from Acceptor-Donor to Donor-Acceptor. This new pattern is no longer complementary to guanine but is perfectly complementary to the Acceptor-Donor pattern of adenine. This allows the formation of a stable, two-hydrogen-bond mispair (C*-A), which can be incorporated into the DNA helix during replication, leading to a C-G to T-A transition mutation in the subsequent round of replication. Therefore, the imino tautomer of cytosine would most likely pair with adenine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2185458"}]}
