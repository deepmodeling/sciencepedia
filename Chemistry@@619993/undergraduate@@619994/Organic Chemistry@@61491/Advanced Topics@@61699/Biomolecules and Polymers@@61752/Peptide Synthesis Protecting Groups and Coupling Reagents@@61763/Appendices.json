In solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the most fundamental rule is that the peptide is built from its C-terminus to its N-terminus. This exercise challenges you to apply this core principle to determine the very first component required to synthesize a simple dipeptide, reinforcing the foundational logic of the entire process. [@problem_id:2189163]", "problem": "In an organic chemistry laboratory, a student is tasked with synthesizing the dipeptide glycylalanine (Gly-Ala) using a modern automated synthesizer that employs an Fmoc-based strategy for Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). The synthesis begins by anchoring the C-terminal amino acid to a solid polymer resin. Subsequent amino acids are then added one by one to build the peptide from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. For each coupling step, the incoming amino acid must have its alpha-amino group protected by a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group to prevent unwanted side reactions.\n\nGiven this synthetic plan, which one of the following compounds must be used in the very first step to be attached to the functionalized solid resin?\n\nA. N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycine\n\nB. N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)alanine\n\nC. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)alanine\n\nD. Alanine\n\nE. N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycylalanine", "solution": "1. Identify the directionality of solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS): In standard SPPS, the peptide is assembled from the C-terminus to the N-terminus. Therefore, the first residue attached to the resin must be the C-terminal amino acid of the target peptide.\n\n2. Determine the C-terminal residue in glycylalanine (Gly-Ala): By convention, the sequence Gly-Ala denotes glycine at the N-terminus and alanine at the C-terminus. Hence, alanine is the first residue that must be attached to the resin.\n\n3. Apply the Fmoc strategy requirement: In an Fmoc-based SPPS, the amino acid to be attached to the resin must have its alpha-amino group protected with an Fmoc group to prevent undesired reactions during attachment and subsequent coupling steps. The carboxyl group is used to form the bond to the resinâ€™s linker.\n\n4. Evaluate the options:\n- A (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycine): Glycine is not the C-terminal residue for Gly-Ala; using this would give the wrong sequence.\n- B (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)alanine): This is alanine with an Fmoc-protected alpha-amino group, exactly the required protected C-terminal residue for Fmoc-SPPS of Gly-Ala.\n- C (N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)alanine): Boc protection is used in Boc-based strategies, not in an Fmoc-based synthesis.\n- D (Alanine): Unprotected alpha-amino group would lead to side reactions; not compatible with the Fmoc strategy requirements for the initial loading.\n- E (N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycylalanine): A preformed dipeptide is not used as the first loading step in this plan, which builds residues one by one.\n\n5.

This practice explores the use of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ($DCC$), a classic coupling reagent, to achieve this transformation. By identifying the major byproduct and its properties, you will gain insight into how the choice of reagent can profoundly simplify the purification process, a key consideration in practical organic synthesis. [@problem_id:2189173]", "problem": "In the field of solid-phase or solution-phase peptide synthesis, the formation of an amide bond between two amino acids requires the activation of the carboxyl group of one amino acid to make it susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the other. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) is a widely used coupling reagent for this purpose.\n\nConsider a scenario where a chemist is synthesizing a dipeptide from an N-terminally protected amino acid (e.g., Boc-Alanine) and a C-terminally protected amino acid (e.g., Glycine methyl ester) using DCC as the coupling agent in Dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent.

The solid is dicyclohexylurea (DCU). Its insolubility in common organic solvents allows for its simple removal from the reaction mixture by filtration, greatly simplifying the purification of the desired peptide.\n\nB.

The general principle is that a carbodiimide activates a carboxylic acid to form an O-acylisourea intermediate, which then undergoes nucleophilic acyl substitution by the amine to furnish the amide and a urea byproduct.

As the reaction proceeds, DCU precipitates as a white solid, which can be removed efficiently by simple filtration. This removal simplifies downstream purification because the main inorganic/neutral byproduct is physically separated without requiring chromatographic steps.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly identifies the solid as DCU and correctly states that its insolubility enables facile removal by filtration, simplifying purification.\n- B is incorrect because DCC is a carbodiimide, not an amine base forming an ammonium carboxylate salt; formation of a dicyclohexylammonium carboxylate is not the defining byproduct of DCC couplings.\n- C is generally incorrect under the given conditions; the desired dipeptide (e.g., Boc-Ala-Gly-OMe) is typically more soluble than DCU in DCM, and the prevalent precipitate in DCC couplings is DCU, not the peptide.\n- D is incorrect because unreacted DCC is soluble in DCM; its precipitation is not a signature of equilibrium stalling. The observed precipitate is DCU, not DCC.\n- E is incorrect as a general identification of the precipitate; while side reactions such as N-acylurea formation can occur, the characteristic, abundant white insoluble solid routinely observed is DCU, not a symmetrical anhydride, and the statement does not accurately describe the practical purification advantage.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2189173"}, {"introduction": "The power of solid-phase peptide synthesis comes from its iterative nature, where a cycle of coupling and deprotection is repeated to build the chain.

N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)glycine is a carbamate of glycine, with the Fmoc group attached via an oxygen to the carbonyl that protects the glycine nitrogen. Under base, the benzylic position of the Fmoc group is deprotonated to give a carbanion stabilized by the fluorenyl system. This promotes elimination to expel the carbamate fragment attached to glycine.\n\nStep 2: Formation of dibenzofulvene and free amine via carbamate fragmentation and decarboxylation. The leaving carbamate fragment collapses to produce the free amine (glycine) and carbon dioxide.
