The mass of a b-ion is the sum of the residue masses of the amino acids it contains.\n2.  **y-ions**: Fragments containing the C-terminus. The mass of a y-ion is the sum of the residue masses of the amino acids it contains, plus the mass of a single water molecule (H₂O).\n\nThe MS/MS spectrum reveals the following set of major fragment ions, with their mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) given in daltons (Da) or atomic mass units (u):\n\n{89.06, 147.07, 188.13, 262.10, 303.16, 361.17}\n\nUsing the provided table of amino acid residue masses, determine the primary sequence of the tetrapeptide.

Its structure is investigated using a combination of biochemical techniques. Gel filtration chromatography, a method for determining the mass of a protein in its native, folded state, indicates that nectarin has a molecular weight of 200 kDa.\n\nFurther analysis is performed using Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a technique that denatures proteins and separates the resulting polypeptide chains based on their mass. Two separate SDS-PAGE experiments are conducted:\n\n1.  In the first experiment, the protein is treated with SDS but **without** any reducing agent. This experiment yields a single band on the gel corresponding to a molecular weight of 100 kDa.\n2.  In the second experiment, the protein is treated with SDS and also with a reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol (BME), which specifically breaks covalent disulfide bonds. This experiment results in two distinct bands on the gel, one corresponding to a molecular weight of 60 kDa and the other to 40 kDa.\n\nBased on these experimental results, determine which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete description of the quaternary structure of the native nectarin protein.\n\nA. The protein is a homodimer composed of two identical 100 kDa polypeptide chains associated via non-covalent interactions.\n\nB.

The protein is a heterotetramer, best described as a dimer of dimers. Each of the larger dimers is composed of a 60 kDa polypeptide chain and a 40 kDa polypeptide chain covalently linked by at least one disulfide bond. These two larger dimeric units are associated non-covalently to form the native protein.", "solution": "We apply the following principles:\n- Gel filtration (size-exclusion chromatography) reports the molecular mass of the native, folded assembly, preserving noncovalent and covalent associations.\n- SDS-PAGE denatures proteins and disrupts noncovalent interactions; without reducing agent, disulfide bonds remain intact; with a reducing agent such as β-mercaptoethanol (BME), disulfide bonds are cleaved.\n\nFrom gel filtration, the native nectarin has mass $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$, so the intact quaternary assembly has $m_{\\text{native}}=200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$.\n\nIn SDS-PAGE without reducing agent, a single band at $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ is observed. Since SDS denaturation removes noncovalent interactions, the persistence of a $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ species indicates that within the native complex there exists at least one covalently (disulfide) linked unit of mass $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ that does not dissociate without reduction. Therefore, there is a disulfide-linked subassembly of mass $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$.\n\nIn SDS-PAGE with BME, two bands at $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ appear. The only change from the nonreducing condition is the reduction of disulfide bonds; therefore, the $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked unit must be composed of one $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide and one $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide linked by at least one disulfide bond. Symbolically, $60+40=100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ for the disulfide-linked dimer observed under nonreducing SDS-PAGE.\n\nCombining with the native mass, $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ equals two copies of the $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked heterodimer. Since SDS removes noncovalent interactions and the nonreducing SDS-PAGE already yields the $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked unit, the additional association needed to reach $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ in the native state must be noncovalent between two such heterodimers. Thus, the native quaternary structure is a heterotetramer best described as a dimer of dimers: each dimer is a $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ chain covalently (disulfide) linked to a $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ chain, and two such dimers associate noncovalently to form the $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ native protein.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incompatible with the reducing SDS-PAGE, which reveals non-identical chains of $60$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ rather than identical $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ chains.\n- B is incompatible with the nonreducing SDS-PAGE, which shows a $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ band, indicating disulfide linkage; if only noncovalent interactions were present, one would observe $60$ and $40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ bands without reduction.\n- C matches the disulfide-linked $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ heterodimer but fails to account for the native $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ mass.\n- D predicts disulfide-linked $60$-$60$ and $40$-$40$ dimers, which would appear near $120$ and $80\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ under nonreducing SDS-PAGE, not the observed single $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ band.\n- E matches all observations: a $200\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ native mass composed of two $100\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ disulfide-linked $60$-$40$ heterodimers associated noncovalently.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description is a heterotetramer that is a dimer of disulfide-linked $60\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$-$40\\ \\mathrm{kDa}$ heterodimers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2192802"}]}
