This exercise focuses on a core skill: determining the structure of an enantiomer and applying the D/L naming convention. By working through the configuration of D-arabinose and its mirror image, you will practice the essential rules that govern the classification of simple sugars [@problem_id:2203562].", "problem": "In carbohydrate chemistry, Fischer projections are a standard way to represent the stereochemistry of sugars. Consider the aldopentose D-arabinose. In its standard Fischer projection, the carbon chain is oriented vertically with the aldehyde group ($\\text{CHO}$) at the top, designated as carbon-1 ($C_1$), and the primary alcohol group ($\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$) at the bottom, designated as carbon-5 ($C_5$).\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of D-arabinose is defined by the orientation of the hydroxyl ($-\\text{OH}$) groups on its three chiral centers:\n- On $C_2$, the $-\\text{OH}$ group is on the left.\n- On $C_3$, the $-\\text{OH}$ group is on the right.\n- On $C_4$, the $-\\text{OH}$ group is on the right.\n\nYour task is to identify the correct description for the Fischer projection of the enantiomer of D-arabinose. From the options below, select the one that accurately describes both the stereochemical configuration and the correct D/L designation for this enantiomer.\n\nA.

The $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_2$ is on the right, the $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_3$ is on the left, the $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_4$ is on the left. It is designated as L-arabinose.\n\nC. The $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_2$ is on the right, the $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_3$ is on the right, the $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_4$ is on the right. It is designated as D-ribose.\n\nD. The $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_2$ is on the right, the $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_3$ is on the left, the $-\\text{OH}$ on $C_4$ is on the right. It is designated as a diastereomer.", "solution": "We are given the Fischer projection configuration of D-arabinose with the vertical chain oriented with $C_{1}$ ($\\text{CHO}$) at the top and $C_{5}$ ($\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$) at the bottom, and with the following stereochemical pattern at its three stereocenters: at $C_{2}$ the hydroxyl is on the left, at $C_{3}$ on the right, and at $C_{4}$ on the right. In shorthand, this configuration can be summarized as $\\left(\\text{left at }C_{2},\\ \\text{right at }C_{3},\\ \\text{right at }C_{4}\\right)$.\n\nBy definition, enantiomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images that invert the configuration at every stereogenic center. Therefore, to obtain the enantiomer of D-arabinose, we invert the configuration at all three chiral centers $C_{2}$, $C_{3}$, and $C_{4}$. This transforms the pattern\n$$\n\\left(\\text{left at }C_{2},\\ \\text{right at }C_{3},\\ \\text{right at }C_{4}\\right)\\ \\to\\ \\left(\\text{right at }C_{2},\\ \\text{left at }C_{3},\\ \\text{left at }C_{4}\\right).\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the D/L designation of this enantiomer. For aldoses in the standard Fischer projection ($\\text{CHO}$ at $C_{1}$ on top, $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at the bottom), the D/L designation is determined by the configuration at the highest-numbered stereocenter. For an aldopentose, the highest-numbered stereocenter is $C_{4}$. If the hydroxyl at $C_{4}$ is on the right, the sugar is in the D series; if it is on the left, the sugar is in the L series. In the enantiomer obtained above, the hydroxyl at $C_{4}$ is on the left, so the sugar is in the L series, i.e., it is L-arabinose.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the enantiomer is: $C_{2}$ hydroxyl on the right, $C_{3}$ hydroxyl on the left, $C_{4}$ hydroxyl on the left, designated as L-arabinose. This matches option B. For completeness, option A reproduces the original D-arabinose, option C describes a different sugar (D-ribose) with all hydroxyls on the right, and option D inverts only two centers, giving a diastereomer rather than the enantiomer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2203562"}, {"introduction": "While Fischer projections depict linear sugars, most monosaccharides exist as cyclic structures in solution. This practice explores the Haworth projection, which represents these ring forms. The process of cyclization creates a new chiral center, the anomeric carbon, resulting in stereoisomers called anomers ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$). This problem challenges you to identify this key carbon and its configuration in a ketofuranose, extending your understanding beyond simple aldopyranoses [@problem_id:2203557].", "problem": "Consider the Haworth projection of a cyclic monosaccharide derived from a D-ketohexose. The structure is a furanose (a five-membered ring). The carbon atoms of the parent chain are numbered $C_1$ through $C_6$. The five-membered ring is composed of carbons $C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5$, and an oxygen atom, where the oxygen atom provides the linkage between $C_2$ and $C_5$. The orientations of the substituents on the ring carbons are described as follows:\n\n*   On $C_2$: A hydroxymethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$, which corresponds to $C_1$ of the parent chain) is oriented downwards.

The carbonyl carbon becomes the new stereogenic (anomeric) center. Therefore, by definition, the anomeric carbon is $C_{2}$.\n\nIn Haworth projections, for D-sugars the reference substituent is the $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at $C_{5}$; it is drawn up. The anomeric designation follows:\n- $\\alpha$ if the anomeric hydroxyl is trans to the $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at $C_{5}$ (i.e., one up and the other down),\n- $\\beta$ if the anomeric hydroxyl is cis to the $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at $C_{5}$ (both up or both down).\n\nFrom the description:\n- At $C_{5}$, the $-\\!CH_{2}OH$ (corresponding to $C_{6}$) is oriented up.\n- At $C_{2}$ (the anomeric carbon), the $-\\!OH$ is oriented up (and the $-\\!CH_{2}OH$ corresponding to $C_{1}$ is down).\n\nThus, the anomeric $-\\!OH$ at $C_{2}$ and the $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at $C_{5}$ are on the same side (both up), i.e., they are cis.
