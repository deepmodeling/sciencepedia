By converting both ends of an aldose into carboxylic acid groups to form an aldaric acid, we create a molecule whose optical activity depends on its internal symmetry. This exercise challenges you to use the resulting optical properties to deduce the structure of the original sugar, a classic technique in carbohydrate chemistry.

To distinguish between them, the student performs a vigorous oxidation reaction using hot, concentrated nitric acid ($\\text{HNO}_3$). This reaction is known to convert the aldehyde group at carbon-1 and the primary alcohol group at carbon-6 of an aldose into carboxylic acid groups, yielding a type of dicarboxylic acid known as an aldaric acid.\n\nAfter the reaction and purification, polarimetry analysis reveals that the resulting aldaric acid is optically inactive.

Neither D-Allose nor D-Altrose would produce an optically inactive aldaric acid.", "solution": "The key chemical principle is that hot, concentrated nitric acid oxidizes an aldose by converting the aldehyde at C1 and the primary alcohol at C6 into carboxylic acids, producing an aldaric acid. This oxidation leaves the configurations at C2, C3, C4, and C5 unchanged. Therefore, the stereochemical pattern at these four centers in the aldaric acid is inherited directly from the starting aldohexose.\n\nAn aldaric acid is optically inactive if, and only if, it is meso. For a linear aldaric acid derived from an aldohexose, meso symmetry is achieved when there is an internal mirror plane that exchanges the top and bottom halves of the molecule. In a Fischer projection with identical ends (COOH at C1 and C6), this requires that the substituent patterns at equidistant stereocenters from the center match: specifically,\n- C2 and C5 must have the same configuration,\n- C3 and C4 must have the same configuration.\nEquivalently, the sequence of configurations at C2–C5 must be palindromic.\n\nNow evaluate the two candidates:\n- D-Allose has all hydroxyl groups on the right at C2, C3, C4, and C5, i.e., the pattern (right, right, right, right). Thus C2 and C5 match, and C3 and C4 match. The resulting aldaric acid has a horizontal internal mirror plane through the midpoint between C3 and C4 and is meso, hence optically inactive.\n- D-Altrose has the pattern (left, right, right, right) at C2–C5. Here C2 and C5 do not match, although C3 and C4 do. The overall sequence is not palindromic, so the aldaric acid lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is optically active.\n\nTherefore, only D-Allose yields an optically inactive (meso) aldaric acid under these conditions, so the unknown sample was D-Allose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194726"}, {"introduction": "Beyond modifying terminal carbons, chemists can selectively cleave the carbon backbone of a monosaccharide using periodic acid ($\\text{HIO}_4$). This reaction is exquisitely specific for vicinal diols (adjacent -OH groups) and serves as a fundamental technique for mapping the structure of complex carbohydrates.

Each cleaved 1,2-diol consumes one mole of $\\text{HIO}_4$ and converts each of the two carbons into a carbonyl group (aldehyde if the carbon bears a hydrogen, ketone if not).\n\nMethyl $\\beta$-D-fructofuranoside is a methyl glycoside of D-fructose in the furanose form. The five-membered ring comprises C2-O5-C5-C4-C3-C2, with C2 as the anomeric (acetal) carbon bearing $-\\text{OCH}_3$ and O5 substituents. The free hydroxyl groups in this glycoside are on C1 (primary $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$), C3, C4 (both secondary), and C6 (primary $\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$). Crucially, C2 is an acetal carbon with no OH, and C5 is part of the ring oxygen linkage, also without OH.\n\nTherefore, the only vicinal diol present in the molecule is the C3-C4 pair. The adjacent pairs C1-C2, C2-C3, C4-C5, and C5-C6 are not diols because either C2 or C5 lacks a hydroxyl group. By the Malaprade rule, cleavage of this single oxidizable 1,2-diol consumes exactly one mole of $\\text{HIO}_4$ per mole of substrate:\n$$\nn_{\\text{HIO}_4} = 1 \\quad \\text{per mole of methyl } \\beta\\text{-D-fructofuranoside}.\n$$\nUpon oxidation of the C3-C4 diol, the C3-C4 bond is cleaved and each of C3 and C4 becomes a carbonyl center. Since both C3 and C4 are secondary carbons bearing a hydrogen, each is converted into an aldehyde. The molecule remains a single, continuous structure because C3 and C4 are still connected through the alternative path C3-C2-O5-C5-C4 in the original ring framework. No new vicinal diols are created, and the other potential pairs involving C1 or C6 remain non-oxidizable due to the absence of adjacent OH at C2 or C5. Consequently, no further $\\text{HIO}_4$ is consumed.\n\nBecause neither C1 nor C6 participates in a vicinal diol with an adjacent hydroxyl-bearing carbon, no formaldehyde or formic acid is produced. The sole organic product is a single molecule bearing two aldehyde functions at the former C3 and C4 positions.\n\nThese conclusions match the statement that 1 mole of $\\text{HIO}_4$ is consumed per mole of substrate and the sole organic product is one larger molecule containing two aldehyde groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2194731"}, {"introduction": "This final practice bridges the gap between reaction theory and modern spectroscopic analysis, demonstrating how molecular symmetry directly influences experimental data.
