In an aqueous solution, D-glucose exists in equilibrium between its cyclic forms and its open-chain form. The dominant cyclic form is a pyranose ring, which is a cyclic hemiacetal. A key characteristic of a hemiacetal is that this cyclic structure can reversibly open to form the corresponding aldehyde and alcohol. For D-glucose, this equilibrium means a small but significant concentration of the open-chain form, which possesses a free aldehyde group ($-\\text{CHO}$) at the C1 carbon, is always present.\n\n$$\n\\text{Cyclic hemiacetal (D-glucose)} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Open-chain aldehyde form}\n$$\n\nTollens' reagent, $[Ag(NH_{3})_{2}]^{+}$, is a mild oxidizing agent. Its specific function is to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylate ions. During this redox reaction, the silver(I) ions ($Ag^{+}$) in the complex are reduced to elemental silver ($Ag(s)$), which then plates out on the glass surface as a reflective silver mirror.\n\n$$\n\\text{R-CHO} + 2[Ag(NH_{3})_{2}]^{+} + 3OH^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{R-COO}^{-} + 2Ag(s) + 4NH_{3} + 2H_{2}O\n$$\n\nSince Sample A (D-glucose) exists in equilibrium with its open-chain aldehyde form, it will react positively with Tollens' reagent. As the aldehyde form is consumed by the reaction, Le Châtelier's principle dictates that the equilibrium will shift from the cyclic hemiacetal form to the open-chain form to replenish the aldehyde, allowing the reaction to proceed until a visible silver mirror is formed. Sugars that give a positive test with Tollens' reagent are known as reducing sugars.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of methyl $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside (Sample B). This molecule is formed when the anomeric hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) on the C1 carbon of D-glucose is replaced by a methoxy group ($-\\text{OCH}_{3}$). This creates a glycosidic bond. The resulting functional group at the anomeric carbon is an acetal, not a hemiacetal.\n\nUnlike hemiacetals, acetals are stable in neutral or basic solutions (the conditions of the Tollens' test). The acetal linkage does not spontaneously open to form an aldehyde. Therefore, methyl $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside cannot provide a free aldehyde group to be oxidized by the Tollens' reagent. Consequently, no reaction will occur, and no silver mirror will be observed. Sugars like this are known as non-reducing sugars.\n\nTherefore, the expected observation that confirms the successful conversion is that Sample A (D-glucose) will give a positive test (silver mirror), while Sample B (methyl $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside) will give a negative test (no silver mirror).\n\nAnalyzing the choices:\nA. Incorrect. Sample B, the acetal, will not react.\nB. Incorrect. Sample A, the hemiacetal, will react.\nC. Correct. Sample A (hemiacetal) reacts, but Sample B (acetal) does not.\nD. Incorrect. This reverses the expected reactivity.\nE. Incorrect.
