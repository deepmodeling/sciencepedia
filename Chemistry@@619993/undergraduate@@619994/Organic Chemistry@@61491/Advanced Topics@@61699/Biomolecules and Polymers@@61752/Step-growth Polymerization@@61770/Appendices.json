For this specific batch, the reaction vessel is charged with 1.000 mole of terephthalic acid and 1.000 mole of ethylene glycol. However, just before initiating the polymerization, it is discovered that the ethylene glycol stock was contaminated, and 0.020 moles of ethanol (a monofunctional alcohol) were inadvertently added to the reaction mixture.\n\nThe polymerization is allowed to proceed until the reaction reaches an extent of reaction, $p$, of 0.995. The extent of reaction is defined as the fraction of the initial functional groups of the limiting reactant that have reacted.\n\nAssuming the reaction goes to this extent, calculate the number-average degree of polymerization ($\\bar{X}_n$) for the resulting polymer.

This can be calculated as the ratio of the total initial number of monomer molecules, $N_0$, to the total final number of molecules in the system, $N$.\n\n$$\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{N_0}{N}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total initial number of moles of all monomer molecules, $N_0$.\nThe initial mixture contains:\n- Moles of terephthalic acid (a difunctional monomer, A-A type) = $1.000 \\text{ mol}$\n- Moles of ethylene glycol (a difunctional monomer, B-B type) = $1.000 \\text{ mol}$\n- Moles of ethanol (a monofunctional monomer, B type) = $0.020 \\text{ mol}$\n\nThe total initial moles of monomer molecules is the sum of these quantities:\n$$N_0 = 1.000 \\text{ mol} + 1.000 \\text{ mol} + 0.020 \\text{ mol} = 2.020 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the total final number of molecules, $N$. In a polymerization reaction, the total number of molecules decreases as monomers link together. For each bond (in this case, an ester linkage) that is formed, the number of molecules in the system decreases by one. Therefore, the final number of molecules is given by:\n$$N = N_0 - (\\text{number of bonds formed})$$\n\nTo find the number of bonds formed, we must first identify the limiting reactant by counting the total number of each type of functional group. Let A represent the carboxylic acid functional group and B represent the alcohol (hydroxyl) functional group.\n- Total moles of carboxylic acid groups ($N_A$): Each mole of terephthalic acid has 2 moles of carboxylic acid groups.\n$$N_A = 1.000 \\text{ mol of diacid} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ mol A-groups}}{\\text{mol of diacid}} = 2.000 \\text{ mol of A-groups}$$\n- Total moles of hydroxyl groups ($N_B$): Ethylene glycol is a diol and ethanol is a mono-ol.\n$$N_B = \\left(1.000 \\text{ mol of diol} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ mol B-groups}}{\\text{mol of diol}}\\right) + \\left(0.020 \\text{ mol of mono-ol} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mol B-group}}{\\text{mol of mono-ol}}\\right)$$\n$$N_B = 2.000 \\text{ mol} + 0.020 \\text{ mol} = 2.020 \\text{ mol of B-groups}$$\n\nComparing $N_A$ and $N_B$, we see that $N_A < N_B$. Therefore, the carboxylic acid groups (A-groups) are the limiting functional groups.\n\nThe problem states that the extent of reaction, $p$, is 0.995 for the limiting reactant's functional groups. The number of bonds formed is equal to the number of limiting functional groups that have reacted.\n$$\\text{Bonds formed} = p \\times N_A = 0.995 \\times 2.000 \\text{ mol} = 1.990 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the final number of molecules, $N$:\n$$N = N_0 - (\\text{bonds formed}) = 2.020 \\text{ mol} - 1.990 \\text{ mol} = 0.030 \\text{ mol}$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the number-average degree of polymerization, $\\bar{X}_n$:\n$$\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{N_0}{N} = \\frac{2.020 \\text{ mol}}{0.030 \\text{ mol}} = 67.333...$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\bar{X}_n \\approx 67.3$$\nThe presence of the monofunctional ethanol creates a stoichiometric imbalance and acts as a chain stopper, significantly limiting the final degree of polymerization compared to what would be achievable with a purely equimolar difunctional system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{67.3}$$", "id": "2201145"}, {"introduction": "Beyond stoichiometric control, the success of a polymerization often hinges on kinetic factors, where the desired chain-forming reaction must outpace competing side reactions.
