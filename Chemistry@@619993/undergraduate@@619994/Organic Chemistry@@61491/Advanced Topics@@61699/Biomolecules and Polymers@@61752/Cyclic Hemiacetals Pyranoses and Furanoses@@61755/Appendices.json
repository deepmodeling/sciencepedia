Mastering this will allow you to distinguish between closely related sugar structures with confidence.", "problem": "In aqueous solution, aldohexoses like D-glucose and D-mannose exist in a dynamic equilibrium between their open-chain aldehyde form and various cyclic hemiacetal forms. The most stable of these cyclic forms are six-membered rings, known as pyranoses, formed by the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group at carbon C-5 onto the aldehyde carbonyl at carbon C-1. This cyclization creates a new stereocenter at C-1, the anomeric carbon, leading to two possible anomers, designated $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nD-glucose and D-mannose are themselves stereoisomers, specifically classified as epimers because they differ in configuration at only a single chiral center, which is the C-2 carbon.\n\nConsider the specific cyclic forms $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose and $\\alpha$-D-mannopyranose.

D-glucose and D-mannose are stereoisomers that differ only at one stereogenic center, specifically at carbon $C\\text{-}2$, and are therefore epimers at $C\\text{-}2$.

In the Fischer projection, D-glucose has the $C\\text{-}2$ hydroxyl on the right, while D-mannose has the $C\\text{-}2$ hydroxyl on the left.
