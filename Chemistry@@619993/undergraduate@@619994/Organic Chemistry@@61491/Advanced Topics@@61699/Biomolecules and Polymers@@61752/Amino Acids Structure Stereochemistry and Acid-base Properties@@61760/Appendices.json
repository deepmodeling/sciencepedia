The identity of the amino acid is determined by its R-group. Consider a particular alpha-amino acid where the R-group is a *sec*-butyl group. Determine the total number of stereocenters (chiral centers) present in a single molecule of this amino acid.", "solution": "A stereocenter, or chiral center, is an atom (typically carbon) that is bonded to four different groups. To solve this problem, we must first construct the molecule described and then examine each carbon atom to see if it meets this criterion.\n\nStep 1: Define the structure of an alpha-amino acid.\nAs stated in the problem, an alpha-amino acid has a central alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) bonded to four distinct entities:\n1.  An amino group: $-\\text{NH}_2$\n2.  A carboxyl group: $-\\text{COOH}$\n3.  A hydrogen atom: $-\\text{H}$\n4.  A side chain: R-group\n\nStep 2: Define the structure of the R-group.\nThe problem specifies that the R-group is a *sec*-butyl group. A butyl group has four carbon atoms. The prefix *sec*- (secondary) indicates that the group is attached to the main structure via its secondary carbon atom. The structure of a *sec*-butyl group is $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)(\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3)$.\n\nStep 3: Assemble the complete molecule.\nWe attach the *sec*-butyl group to the alpha-carbon of the amino acid structure. Let's analyze the atoms in the resulting molecule to identify stereocenters.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$).\nThe alpha-carbon is bonded to the following four groups:\n1.  The amino group ($-\\text{NH}_2$)\n2.  The carboxyl group ($-\\text{COOH}$)\n3.  The hydrogen atom ($-\\text{H}$)\n4.  The *sec*-butyl side chain ($-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)(\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3)$)\n\nThese four groups are all different from each other. Therefore, the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) is a stereocenter.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the carbons in the *sec*-butyl side chain.\nThe *sec*-butyl side chain has the structure $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)(\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3)$. Let's label the carbons for clarity. The carbon attached to $C_{\\alpha}$ is the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$), the next in the ethyl part is the gamma-carbon ($C_{\\gamma}$), and the terminal carbon of the ethyl part is the delta-carbon ($C_{\\delta}$). The methyl branch is also attached to $C_{\\beta}$.\n\nLet's analyze the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$): This is the carbon atom of the side chain directly attached to the alpha-carbon. It is bonded to the following four groups:\n1.  The rest of the amino acid backbone, attached via $C_{\\alpha}$. The group is $-\\text{CH}(\\text{NH}_2)(\\text{COOH})$.\n2.  A hydrogen atom ($-\\text{H}$).\n3.  A methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$).\n4.  An ethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$).\n\nThese four groups are all different from each other. Therefore, the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$) is also a stereocenter.\n\nLet's analyze the other carbons:\n-   The carbon atom of the methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) attached to $C_{\\beta}$ is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. It is not a stereocenter.\n-   The gamma-carbon ($C_{\\gamma}$) of the ethyl part ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms. It is not a stereocenter.\n-   The delta-carbon ($C_{\\delta}$) of the ethyl part ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms. It is not a stereocenter.\n-   The carbon atom of the carboxyl group ($-\\text{COOH}$) is double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen. Since it is not bonded to four different groups (it's not $sp^3$ hybridized), it cannot be a stereocenter.\n\nStep 6: Tally the stereocenters.\nWe have identified two stereocenters in the molecule: the alpha-carbon ($C_{\\alpha}$) and the beta-carbon ($C_{\\beta}$). This amino acid is known as isoleucine.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stereocenters in the molecule is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2154558"}, {"introduction": "Moving from static structure to dynamic behavior, we now explore the acid-base properties of amino acids, which are crucially characterized by their isoelectric point ($pI$).
