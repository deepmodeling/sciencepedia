The stereochemistry of its acyclic form can be described by its Fischer projection. With the aldehyde group at C1 (the top), the hydroxyl groups on carbons C2, C3, C4, and C5 are oriented to the right, left, right, and right, respectively.\n\nIn aqueous solution, D-glucose undergoes intramolecular cyclization where the hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the aldehyde group at C1. This reaction forms a stable six-membered ring structure known as a pyranose. This cyclization creates a new stereocenter at C1, which is now called the anomeric carbon. The resulting pair of diastereomers are called anomers, denoted as $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nFor D-sugars in their cyclic Haworth projection, the terminal $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{OH}$ group (C6) is conventionally drawn pointing 'up'. The $\\beta$-anomer is defined as the isomer where the newly formed hydroxyl group on the anomeric carbon (C1) also points 'up', meaning it is on the same side of the ring as the C6 substituent.\n\nThe pyranose ring is not planar and preferentially adopts a stable, non-planar chair conformation to minimize steric and torsional strain.

Upon intramolecular cyclization (C5 hydroxyl attacking C1 aldehyde), a pyranose ring forms, and the anomeric center at C1 is created. For the $\\beta$-anomer of a D-sugar, both the anomeric hydroxyl at C1 and the terminal $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at C5 are drawn “up” in the Haworth projection.\n\nConversion rules from Fischer to Haworth for D-pyranoses:\n- Substituents on the right in the Fischer projection project down in the Haworth projection.\n- Substituents on the left in the Fischer projection project up in the Haworth projection.\n- For D-sugars, the $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ at C5 projects up.\n- In the $\\beta$-anomer, the anomeric OH at C1 is up.\n\nApplying these to D-glucopyranose:\n- C1: OH is up (by definition of $\\beta$).\n- C2: OH is down (right in Fischer).\n- C3: OH is up (left in Fischer).\n- C4: OH is down (right in Fischer).\n- C5: substituent is $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$, up (D-sugar).\n\nNow map Haworth up/down to axial/equatorial in the most stable chair. The stable chair for D-glucopyranose is the $^{4}\\text{C}_{1}$ chair, in which the axial directions alternate up and down around the ring. In this chair:\n- At C1, “up” is equatorial and “down” is axial.\n- At C2, “down” is equatorial and “up” is axial.\n- At C3, “up” is equatorial and “down” is axial.\n- At C4, “down” is equatorial and “up” is axial.\n- At C5, “up” is equatorial and “down” is axial.\n\nAssigning equatorial/axial to the hydroxyl groups:\n- C1 OH: up at C1 ⇒ equatorial.\n- C2 OH: down at C2 ⇒ equatorial.\n- C3 OH: up at C3 ⇒ equatorial.\n- C4 OH: down at C4 ⇒ equatorial.\n\nThus, all four ring hydroxyl substituents (at C1, C2, C3, C4) are equatorial in $\\beta$-D-glucopyranose in its $^{4}\\text{C}_{1}$ chair. The substituent at C5 is $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ (equatorial up), but the hydroxyl within $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ is not a ring substituent and does not itself occupy an axial or equatorial position; the equatorial site at C5 is occupied by the $\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{OH}$ group as a whole.
