{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Mastering the language of chemistry is the first step toward understanding the function of molecules. This exercise focuses on a critical skill: translating between the two major nomenclature systems for unsaturated fatty acids, the delta ($\\Delta$) and omega ($\\omega$) notations. Understanding this conversion is not just an academic task; it is essential for deciphering the nutritional and metabolic roles of important lipids, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids [@problem_id:2182665].", "problem": "In the study of lipids, two primary nomenclature systems are used to describe the structure of unsaturated fatty acids. The delta ($\\Delta$) notation indicates the position of double bonds by counting carbons from the carboxyl group, which is designated as carbon number 1 (C1). The omega ($\\omega$) notation identifies the position of the *first* double bond by counting carbons from the methyl group at the opposite end of the chain, referred to as the omega carbon.\n\nA biologically significant polyunsaturated fatty acid, found in various animal and vegetable fats, is designated by the notation 20:4($\\Delta^{5,8,11,14}$). This notation indicates a fatty acid with 20 carbon atoms and 4 double bonds, with the double bonds starting at carbons 5, 8, 11, and 14, respectively, when counted from the carboxyl end.\n\nBased on these standard conventions, how is this fatty acid classified according to the omega system?\n\nA. Omega-3 fatty acid\n\nB. Omega-6 fatty acid\n\nC. Omega-7 fatty acid\n\nD. Omega-9 fatty acid\n\nE. The notation is structurally invalid for a 20-carbon chain.", "solution": "By definition in the $\\Delta$ system, a double bond at $\\Delta i$ lies between carbons $i$ and $i+1$ when counting from the carboxyl end (C1). Let the total number of carbons be $L$. The mapping from carboxyl indexing $k$ to $\\omega$ indexing is:\n$$\nk \\mapsto \\omega\\text{-index }(L - k + 1).\n$$\nTherefore, the bond between $i$ and $i+1$ (carboxyl count) corresponds to a bond between $\\omega$ indices\n$$\nL - i + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad L - (i+1) + 1 = L - i.\n$$\nThe position of the first double bond from the methyl end (the $\\omega$ classification) is given by the smaller $\\omega$ index among these two, namely $L - i$. Hence, for a polyunsaturated fatty acid with multiple $\\Delta$ positions, the first double bond from the methyl end corresponds to the largest $\\Delta$ index $i_{\\max}$, and the $\\omega$ number is\n$$\nn = L - i_{\\max}.\n$$\nFor the given fatty acid $20:4(\\Delta^{5,8,11,14})$, we have $L = 20$ and $i_{\\max} = 14$, so\n$$\nn = 20 - 14 = 6.\n$$\nThus, it is an $\\omega$-6 fatty acid, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2182665"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental structure of fatty acids, we now explore how they assemble into more complex lipids like triglycerides. When different fatty acids are attached to a glycerol backbone, the specific arrangement gives rise to distinct constitutional isomers with potentially unique properties. This practice challenges you to think systematically about the structure of glycerol and determine the possible isomers that can form from a given set of fatty acid building blocks [@problem_id:2182655].", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis, a mixed triglyceride is formed through the esterification of one molecule of glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol) with a specific mixture of fatty acids. The reaction mixture contains two molecules of stearic acid and one molecule of oleic acid for every one molecule of glycerol, and the reaction is carried to completion to form triglycerides.\n\nFor context, stearic acid is the common name for octadecanoic acid, an 18-carbon saturated fatty acid. Oleic acid is the common name for (Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid, an 18-carbon monounsaturated fatty acid.\n\nWhen naming triglycerides, the fatty acyl groups are listed, and their positions on the glycerol backbone (1, 2, or 3) are specified. For example, a triglyceride formed from three stearic acid molecules is named 1,2,3-tristearoyl-glycerol.\n\nAssuming that all possible constitutional isomers are formed, which of the following pairs correctly identifies the names of the two constitutional isomers of the mixed triglyceride produced in this synthesis?\n\nA. 1,3-Distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol and 1,2-Distearoyl-3-oleoyl-glycerol\n\nB. 1,2,3-Tristearoyl-glycerol and 1,2,3-Trioleoyl-glycerol\n\nC. 1-Stearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol and 1,3-Distearoyl-glycerol\n\nD. 1,3-Dipalmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol and 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-3-oleoyl-glycerol\n\nE. Only one isomer, 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, is possible.", "solution": "We are esterifying glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol), which has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3, with a mixture of two stearic acid molecules and one oleic acid molecule. The reaction proceeds to completion to form triacylglycerols, so each glycerol molecule will be triesterified with exactly two stearoyl and one oleoyl groups.\n\nConstitutional isomers differ by the connectivity, here by which positions on the glycerol backbone receive which acyl groups. The glycerol backbone has two terminal positions (1 and 3) and one central position (2). Positions 1 and 3 are constitutionally equivalent under renumbering, while position 2 is distinct.\n\nTherefore, with two identical stearoyl groups (S) and one distinct oleoyl group (O), there are exactly two distinct constitutional arrangements:\n- O at position 2 and S at positions 1 and 3, giving the name 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol.\n- O at a terminal position (either 1 or 3) and S at the remaining two positions. Because positions 1 and 3 are equivalent by renumbering, this is a single constitutional isomer, named 1,2-distearoyl-3-oleoyl-glycerol (equivalently 1-oleoyl-2,3-distearoyl-glycerol).\n\nHence, the two constitutional isomers produced are 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol and 1,2-distearoyl-3-oleoyl-glycerol, which corresponds to option A. The other options are incorrect because:\n- B lists homotriacylglycerols not matching the composition.\n- C lists diacylglycerols (only two acyl groups), not triglycerides.\n- D uses palmitoyl groups, which are not present.\n- E incorrectly claims only one isomer, but there are two as shown.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2182655"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the structure of lipids is key, but equally important is understanding their chemical reactivity.
