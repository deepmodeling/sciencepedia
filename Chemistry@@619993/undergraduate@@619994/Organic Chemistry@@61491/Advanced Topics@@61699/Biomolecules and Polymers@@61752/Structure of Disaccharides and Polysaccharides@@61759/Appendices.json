By translating the term '$\\beta(1\\to4)$ linkage' into a specific three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, you will solidify your understanding of how monosaccharides connect to form larger structures [@problem_id:2205734].", "problem": "Cellobiose is a disaccharide that serves as the repeating structural unit of cellulose, the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. It is formed by the condensation of two D-glucose monosaccharide units.

The anomeric carbon (C1) of one D-glucose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C4 position of a second D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is beta, meaning the oxygen atom of the bond is in an equatorial position with respect to the first glucose ring.\n\nB. The anomeric carbon (C1) of one D-glucose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C4 position of a second D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is alpha, meaning the oxygen atom of the bond is in an axial position with respect to the first glucose ring.\n\nC. The anomeric carbon (C1) of one D-glucose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C6 position of a second D-glucose unit.

The anomeric carbon (C1) of a D-galactose unit is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group at the C4 position of a D-glucose unit. The stereochemistry of this glycosidic linkage is beta.", "solution": "We first recall the nomenclature and structural principles for disaccharide glycosidic linkages:\n- The term $\\beta(1\\rightarrow 4)$ specifies that the glycosidic bond is formed from the anomeric carbon at C1 of the first sugar to the oxygen of the hydroxyl group attached to C4 of the second sugar, with the configuration at the anomeric center of the first sugar being $\\beta$.\n- The $\\beta$ designation refers to the configuration at the anomeric carbon of the donor monosaccharide: for D-glucopyranose in the standard ${}^{4}C_{1}$ chair, the $\\beta$ substituent at C1 is equatorial. Thus, a $\\beta$-glycosidic bond from D-glucose implies that the glycosidic oxygen attached at C1 is equatorial with respect to the first glucose ring.\n- In cellobiose, both units are D-glucopyranose, and the linkage is specifically $\\beta(1\\rightarrow 4)$, so the anomeric carbon C1 of one D-glucose is bonded via oxygen to the hydroxyl on C4 of the second D-glucose. The second glucose’s anomeric carbon remains free (reducing end), consistent with cellulose repeating units.\n\nNow evaluate each option against these criteria:\n- Option A: States that C1 of one D-glucose is bonded to the oxygen of the hydroxyl at C4 of a second D-glucose, and that the stereochemistry is $\\beta$ with the glycosidic oxygen equatorial relative to the first glucose. This exactly matches the definition and conformational implication for D-glucopyranose in a $\\beta(1\\rightarrow 4)$ linkage. This is correct.\n- Option B: Identical connectivity but specifies $\\alpha$ (axial) stereochemistry. This contradicts the known $\\beta(1\\rightarrow 4)$ linkage of cellobiose; incorrect.\n- Option C: Specifies a $(1\\rightarrow 6)$ linkage. Cellobiose is $(1\\rightarrow 4)$; incorrect.\n- Option D: Describes a glucose-fructose disaccharide linked via two anomeric carbons, characteristic of sucrose, not cellobiose; incorrect.\n- Option E: Describes a $\\beta(1\\rightarrow 4)$ linkage between D-galactose and D-glucose, which is lactose, not cellobiose; incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description is given in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205734"}, {"introduction": "While the glycosidic bond locks one part of a disaccharide in place, the other end can often remain chemically dynamic. This practice uses lactose, the sugar in milk, to explore the concept of a \"reducing end\" and the resulting phenomenon of anomerism. You will examine how the free hemiacetal group on the glucose unit allows lactose to exist as two distinct anomers, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, and determine the specific structural change that differentiates them in their most stable conformation [@problem_id:2205736].", "problem": "Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, composed of a D-galactose unit and a D-glucose unit. The two monosaccharides are linked by a $\\beta$-1,4-glycosidic bond, where the anomeric carbon (C1) of the galactose unit is linked to the oxygen atom at carbon-4 (C4) of the glucose unit. Both monosaccharide units exist in their pyranose (six-membered ring) form and adopt their most stable chair conformations. Because the anomeric carbon (C1) of the glucose residue is a free hemiacetal, lactose can exist in two anomeric forms, designated as $\\alpha$-lactose and $\\beta$-lactose.\n\nIn the most stable chair conformation of $\\alpha$-lactose, the hydroxyl group attached to the anomeric carbon (C1) of the glucose residue is in the axial position. Based on this information, which of the following statements accurately describes the structure of $\\beta$-lactose in its most stable chair conformation?\n\nA. The hydroxyl group attached to the anomeric carbon (C1) of the glucose residue is in the equatorial position, and the configurations of all other chiral centers remain unchanged.\nB. The hydroxyl group attached to the anomeric carbon (C1) of the galactose residue changes from an equatorial to an axial position.\nC. The entire glucose ring undergoes a chair flip, causing all its axial substituents to become equatorial and all its equatorial substituents to become axial.\nD. The glycosidic bond between the galactose and glucose units changes from a $\\beta$-1,4 linkage to an $\\alpha$-1,4 linkage.\nE. The hydroxyl group at carbon-4 (C4) of the galactose residue changes from an axial to an equatorial position.", "solution": "Lactose is a disaccharide of D-galactose and D-glucose linked by a $\\beta$-1,4-glycosidic bond. In this linkage, the anomeric carbon $C1$ of the galactose unit is fixed in the $\\beta$ configuration and bonded to the oxygen at $C4$ of the glucose unit. The glucose residue retains a free hemiacetal at its anomeric center ($C1$), so it can undergo mutarotation, interconverting between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ anomers. Mutarotation specifically inverts the configuration at the free anomeric carbon ($C1$ of glucose) via ring opening and reclosing, without changing the configurations at other stereocenters or the configuration of the glycosidic bond.\n\nFor D-glucopyranose in its most stable $^{4}C_{1}$ chair conformation, the $\\alpha$ anomer has the anomeric hydroxyl group at $C1$ axial, while the $\\beta$ anomer has that hydroxyl equatorial. The problem states that in the most stable chair conformation of $\\alpha$-lactose, the hydroxyl on $C1$ of glucose is axial, which is consistent with $\\alpha$-D-glucopyranose in the $^{4}C_{1}$ chair. Therefore, in $\\beta$-lactose, the only change upon mutarotation at the glucose residue is that the hydroxyl at $C1$ becomes equatorial; all other chiral centers (including those in both glucose and galactose) retain their configurations, and the $\\beta$-1,4 glycosidic linkage remains unchanged.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that in $\\beta$-lactose, the hydroxyl at $C1$ of glucose is equatorial and all other chiral centers are unchanged.\n- B is incorrect because the galactose anomeric center is involved in the glycosidic bond and cannot undergo anomerization.\n- C is incorrect because conversion between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ anomers occurs by mutarotation at $C1$ of glucose, not by a chair flip of the entire ring; the most stable chair conformation remains $^{4}C_{1}$.\n- D is incorrect because the glycosidic bond configuration ($\\beta$-1,4) does not change.\n- E is incorrect because it refers to $C4$ of galactose, which is not the site of change; moreover, the linkage involves $C4$ of glucose, not galactose.\n\nThus the correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205736"}, {"introduction": "Biochemistry is often a process of deduction, where experimental results are used to unravel complex molecular structures. This final practice puts you in the role of a researcher tasked with identifying an unknown oligosaccharide. Starting with amylose, a polymer of glucose, and given a key piece of evidence—that your isolated trisaccharide is non-reducing—you must synthesize your knowledge to deduce its complete structure. This problem challenges you to think critically about how linkage patterns determine the overall chemical properties of a carbohydrate [@problem_id:2205748].", "problem": "A biochemist is studying the products of carbohydrate degradation. A sample of pure amylose, which is a linear polysaccharide composed entirely of D-glucopyranose units joined by $\\alpha(1 \\to 4)$-glycosidic bonds, is subjected to partial acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The resulting mixture of oligosaccharides is carefully separated using chromatography. One of the isolated fractions is identified as a pure, unbranched trisaccharide. Further analysis of this trisaccharide with Fehling's reagent yields a negative result, indicating that it is a non-reducing sugar.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following descriptions most plausibly represents the structure of this non-reducing trisaccharide? For the purpose of these options, the abbreviation 'Glc' represents a D-glucopyranose unit.\n\nA. Three Glc units are connected in series. The anomeric carbon of the first unit is linked to the C4 hydroxyl of the second unit. The anomeric carbon of the second unit is then linked to the anomeric carbon of the third unit, forming a terminal trehalose-like moiety.\n\nB. Three Glc units are connected in a linear chain by two successive $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds.\n\nC. Two Glc units are linked by an $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ bond, and a third Glc unit is attached as a branch to the C6 hydroxyl of the central glucose unit.\n\nD. Three Glc units are linked head-to-tail by three successive $\\alpha(1\\to4)$ glycosidic bonds to form a small, cyclic structure.", "solution": "We start from the definition of the substrate and the test outcome. Amylose is a linear homopolymer of D-glucopyranose units joined by $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ glycosidic bonds. Partial acid-catalyzed hydrolysis cleaves some of these bonds to give oligosaccharides; such hydrolysis by itself does not introduce branching and preserves the $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ connectivity in any intact linkage. A carbohydrate is reducing if it contains at least one residue with a free anomeric carbon (a hemiacetal) that can undergo ring opening to an aldehyde and reduce Fehling's reagent; conversely, it is non-reducing if all anomeric carbons are engaged in acetal (glycosidic) linkages so that no free anomeric carbon remains.\n\nFor a trisaccharide ($n=3$), there are three anomeric carbons. To be non-reducing, the count of free anomeric carbons must be zero; that is, each anomeric carbon must be involved in a glycosidic (acetal) bond.\n\nEvaluate each option against these criteria and the constraints “pure, unbranched trisaccharide” and “most plausible from partial hydrolysis of amylose”:\n\nOption B describes a linear chain with two successive $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ bonds, i.e., maltotriose. In such a linear maltooligosaccharide, one terminus is the reducing end with a free anomeric carbon, so it would give a positive Fehling’s test. Therefore it contradicts the observed non-reducing behavior and is excluded.\n\nOption C introduces a branch at C6 of the central unit. This contradicts the explicit “unbranched” description. Moreover, such a structure would still leave at least one terminal free anomeric carbon, making it a reducing sugar. Hence it is excluded.\n\nOption D proposes a cyclic trimer formed by three successive $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ linkages, which would indeed be non-reducing because each anomeric carbon would be acetalized in the cycle. However, formation of a three-unit $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ macrocycle is chemically implausible: known cyclodextrins formed from $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ linkages require at least six units, and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of amylose does not produce such small cyclic oligosaccharides. Thus, despite being non-reducing in principle, this is not a plausible product under the stated conditions.\n\nOption A describes an unbranched trisaccharide where the first two units are connected by an $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ linkage (consistent with amylose’s native connectivity), and the second and third units are linked anomeric-to-anomeric (a trehalose-like $1\\leftrightarrow 1$ acetal). In this arrangement, the anomeric carbon of the first unit is involved in the $\\alpha(1\\to 4)$ bond, and both anomeric carbons of the second and third units are tied up in the $1\\leftrightarrow 1$ linkage; thus no free anomeric carbon remains, and the trisaccharide is non-reducing. The structure is unbranched and, among the given choices, is the most plausible representation consistent with an amylose-derived backbone and the observed negative Fehling’s test.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible description is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205748"}]}
