[@problem_id:2158869]", "problem": "Anionic polymerization is a method of chain-growth polymerization in which the active propagating center is an anion. Organolithium reagents, such as n-butyllithium ($CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2Li$), are powerful initiators for this type of reaction. A chemist observes that n-butyllithium can effectively initiate the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene ($CH_2=CH-CH=CH_2$) to form polybutadiene. However, under identical reaction conditions, n-butyllithium fails to initiate any significant polymerization of ethylene ($CH_2=CH_2$).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical explanation for this observed difference in reactivity?\n\nA. The initiation step with 1,3-butadiene produces a resonance-stabilized allylic carbanion, whereas initiation with ethylene would produce a highly unstable primary carbanion.\n\nB. Ethylene is a gas at standard temperature and pressure, which prevents it from dissolving sufficiently in the nonpolar solvents typically used for anionic polymerization.\n\nC. n-Butyllithium is not a strong enough base to deprotonate an sp$^2$-hybridized C-H bond on ethylene, whereas it is strong enough to deprotonate a C-H bond on 1,3-butadiene.\n\nD. The carbon-carbon double bonds in 1,3-butadiene are more sterically accessible to the bulky butyl group of the initiator compared to the double bond in ethylene.\n\nE. The propagation of the ethylene chain is thermodynamically unfavorable because the resulting polymer, polyethylene, is too flexible and has low chain-packing efficiency.", "solution": "The process of initiation in anionic polymerization involves the nucleophilic attack of the initiator on the monomer. In this case, the initiator is n-butyllithium, which can be thought of as a source of the nucleophilic butyl anion ($CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2^-$). The monomer must have a structural feature that makes it susceptible to nucleophilic attack and capable of stabilizing the resulting negative charge.\n\nLet's analyze the initiation step for both monomers.\n\n**Case 1: Initiation with 1,3-butadiene**\n\nThe butyl anion attacks one of the terminal, electron-deficient carbons of the conjugated system in 1,3-butadiene. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to the alkene. For instance, attack at C1 of 1,3-butadiene leads to the formation of a new carbanion.\n\n$$CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2^- + CH_2=CH-CH=CH_2 \\longrightarrow CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2-CH_2-\\overline{C}H-CH=CH_2$$\n\nThe resulting carbanion is an allylic carbanion. The negative charge is not localized on a single carbon atom. Instead, it is delocalized across multiple atoms through resonance, as shown by its resonance structures:\n\n$$[CH_3(CH_2)_3CH_2-\\overline{C}H-CH=CH_2 \\longleftrightarrow CH_3(CH_2)_3CH_2-CH=CH-\\overline{C}H_2]$$\n\nThis resonance delocalization significantly stabilizes the anionic intermediate. Because the formation of this intermediate is energetically favorable, the initiation step proceeds readily, and the stabilized anion can then act as a nucleophile itself to attack another monomer, propagating the polymer chain.\n\n**Case 2: Hypothetical Initiation with Ethylene**\n\nIf the butyl anion were to attack ethylene, a similar nucleophilic addition would occur.\n\n$$CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2^- + CH_2=CH_2 \\longrightarrow CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2-CH_2-\\overline{C}H_2$$\n\nThe product of this hypothetical reaction is the hexyl anion. This is a primary carbanion ($1^{\\circ}$). In a primary carbanion, the negative charge is localized on a single carbon atom and is an extremely unstable, high-energy species. There are no resonance structures to delocalize and stabilize this charge. The formation of such a high-energy intermediate is energetically prohibitive, meaning the activation energy for this step is very high. Consequently, the initiation reaction does not occur to any significant extent.\n\n**Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nThe critical difference lies in the stability of the carbanion formed during the initiation step.\n\n*   **A. The initiation step with 1,3-butadiene produces a resonance-stabilized allylic carbanion, whereas initiation with ethylene would produce a highly unstable primary carbanion.** This statement accurately captures the core chemical principle. The stability of the intermediate is the determining factor for whether initiation is feasible. This is the correct explanation.\n\n*   **B. The initiation with ethylene is prevented by its physical state.** While ethylene is a gas, polymerizations are often carried out under pressure to increase the concentration of the gaseous monomer in the solvent. The failure to polymerize is a fundamental chemical issue, not just a physical limitation.\n\n*   **C. The reaction depends on the basicity of n-butyllithium.** This statement confuses the mechanism. Anionic polymerization initiation is a nucleophilic *addition*, not an acid-base *deprotonation* of the monomer. The butyl anion adds across the double bond. Although n-butyllithium is a very strong base, its role as a base is not what initiates polymerization in this context.\n\n*   **D. Steric hindrance is the primary factor.** This is incorrect. Ethylene ($CH_2=CH_2$) is a small, planar molecule. 1,3-Butadiene is larger. Therefore, ethylene is sterically *less* hindered than 1,3-butadiene, not more. Steric hindrance does not explain why the less-hindered monomer fails to react.\n\n*   **E. The properties of the final polymer prevent the reaction.** The thermodynamic properties of the final polymer (the product) do not determine the kinetic feasibility of the initial step of the reaction. The activation energy of the initiation step is the barrier that must be overcome, and this is dictated by the stability of the transition state and the intermediate, not the final polymer. Polyethylene is a very stable polymer, so this reasoning is flawed.\n\nTherefore, the only correct explanation is the difference in the stability of the carbanionic intermediates formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2158869"}, {"introduction": "Moving from \"if\" a reaction works to \"what\" it produces, this exercise dives into the quantitative aspects of free-radical polymerization.

Achieving a well-defined final product with good control over molecular weight and low dispersity requires careful selection of polymerization mechanisms and the design of specific chemical transformations to switch between them.\n\nThe proposed three-stage synthesis is as follows:\n1.  **Stage 1: PCL Synthesis.** Synthesis of the first block, PCL, from the $\\epsilon$-caprolactone monomer, resulting in a polymer terminated with a reactive functional group.\n2.  **Stage 2: PS Synthesis.** Use of the PCL-based macroinitiator from Stage 1 to polymerize styrene, forming a diblock copolymer that is itself terminated with a new reactive functional group.\n3.  **Stage 3: PIB Synthesis.** Use of the PCL-PS diblock macroinitiator from Stage 2 to polymerize isobutylene, yielding the final PCL-PS-PIB triblock terpolymer.\n\nConsider the following options, each proposing a set of reagents for three critical steps in this synthesis:\n- **Step 1a:** The initiator used to begin the polymerization of $\\epsilon$-caprolactone.\n- **Step 2a:** The key reagent used to transform the terminus of the PCL block into an active initiating site for the controlled polymerization of the subsequent styrene block.

A strong alkoxide such as potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide generates a reactive alkoxide that opens the lactone ring and propagates with good control, yielding PCL bearing a terminal hydroxyl after quench. In contrast, n-butyllithium will not provide clean, controlled ROP of a lactone and risks side reactions; potassium naphthalenide is a strong reducing agent rather than an ROP initiator; and radical initiators such as AIBN or benzoyl peroxide do not effect controlled ROP of lactones. Therefore, potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide is the synthetically viable choice.\n\nFor step 2a, to grow polystyrene in a controlled manner from the PCL chain end, the PCL terminal hydroxyl must be converted into a suitable macroinitiator for a controlled radical polymerization of styrene, most commonly atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Acylation of the hydroxyl using 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide installs a 2-bromoisobutyrate end group, a standard ATRP initiator for styrene. Symbolically, if the PCL end-group is $\\mathrm{PCL-OH}$, reaction with 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide affords $\\mathrm{PCL-O-C(O)-C(CH_{3})_{2}Br}$, which under ATRP conditions yields $\\mathrm{PCL-PS-Br}$ with controlled molecular weight and low dispersity. Allyl bromide would only form an ether and is not a controlled initiator for styrene; divinylbenzene is a crosslinker rather than an initiating group; ethylene oxide followed by 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide is unnecessary elaboration and is paired with an unsuitable step 1a; and conversion to a chloroformate via $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ then $\\mathrm{SOCl_{2}}$ does not create a known controlled initiator for styrene.\n\nFor step 3a, polymerization of isobutylene proceeds by living cationic mechanisms using strong Lewis acids (e.g., $\\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$ or $\\mathrm{BF_{3}\\cdot OEt_{2}}$) in the presence of an appropriate cationogen such as a tertiary alkyl halide or benzylic halide. After ATRP of styrene from a 2-bromoisobutyrate macroinitiator, the PCL-PS chain bears a terminal halide (typically bromide) at the PS end. A strong Lewis acid such as $\\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$ can abstract halide from a benzylic or tertiary halide terminus to generate a carbocation with a non-nucleophilic counterion, which then initiates living cationic polymerization of isobutylene under the standard low-temperature conditions. Among the listed choices, $\\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$ is a well-established Lewis acid for living cationic polymerization of isobutylene from tert-halide or benzylic halide initiators; $\\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$ with a trace of water is also known but appears only in an option with incorrect earlier steps; $\\mathrm{BF_{3}\\cdot OEt_{2}}$ generally requires an alcohol or a suitable tert-halide coinitiator not provided in the corresponding option; $\\mathrm{AgBF_{4}}$ can abstract halide to generate a carbocation, but its use from a polystyrene halide end-group is less standard and can promote side reactions; n-butyllithium cannot initiate isobutylene, which polymerizes cationically, not anionically.\n\nTherefore, the only synthetically coherent and mechanistically sound combination across the three stages is:\n- Step 1a: potassium 3,3-dimethyl-1-butoxide for anionic ROP of $\\epsilon$-caprolactone to PCL with an alcohol terminus.\n- Step 2a: 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide to convert the PCL hydroxyl into an ATRP-competent 2-bromoisobutyrate macroinitiator for styrene, yielding PCL-PS with a terminal halide.\n- Step 3a: $\\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$ to effect halide abstraction at the PS terminus and generate a carbocation that initiates living cationic polymerization of isobutylene.\n\nThis set corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2158904"}]}
