The aromatic sextet of $6\\pi$ electrons is contributed by the ring carbons and the nitrogen $\\pi$ orbital, not by the lone pair.\n- Because the lone pair is not part of the aromatic sextet, it is available for nucleophilic attack and basicity.\n- With an excess of methyl iodide ($CH_3I$), pyridine undergoes $S_N2$ N-alkylation (quaternization) at nitrogen to give the quaternary ammonium salt, N-methylpyridinium iodide.\n- Symbolically: pyridine + $CH_3I$ $\\to$ $[\\text{N-methylpyridinium}]^{+} I^{-}$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze pyrrole nitrogen.\n- In pyrrole, the nitrogen is $sp^2$-hybridized but its lone pair occupies a $p$ orbital and is delocalized into the ring, providing two electrons to complete the $6\\pi$ aromatic sextet.\n- Removal of the nitrogen lone pair from conjugation (as would occur upon N-alkylation) would disrupt aromaticity, which is energetically unfavorable. Consequently, pyrrole is weakly basic and a poor nucleophile at nitrogen under neutral conditions.\n- Methyl iodide ($CH_3I$) requires a sufficiently nucleophilic lone pair to undergo $S_N2$ at nitrogen; in pyrrole this is strongly disfavored due to loss of aromaticity. Thus, under the stated conditions, pyrrole does not undergo significant N-alkylation.\n- Pyrrole typically reacts with electrophiles by electrophilic aromatic substitution at carbon (especially C-2), but $CH_3I$ is not suited to EAS on pyrrole; it is an alkylating agent that reacts via $S_N2$ at nucleophilic centers.\n\nConclusion: Pyridine is readily N-alkylated to N-methylpyridinium iodide; pyrrole does not undergo significant N-alkylation with excess methyl iodide under the same conditions.

Thiophene-2,5-disulfonic acid\n\nD. 2,3-Dihydrothiophene-2-sulfonic acid\n\nE. No reaction occurs", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution is favored on thiophene because it is aromatic with a six-electron delocalized system that satisfies Hückel’s rule, $4n+2$ with $n=1$. The aromatic sextet consists of four electrons from the two C=C bonds and two electrons from a sulfur lone pair in a $p$ orbital.\n\nFuming sulfuric acid generates a very strong electrophile (sulfur trioxide and its protonated forms), so sulfonation proceeds readily by the standard electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism: attack of the ring on the electrophile to form a $\\sigma$-complex (arenium ion), followed by deprotonation to restore aromaticity.\n\nRegioselectivity in thiophene EAS strongly favors substitution at the 2-position (alpha) over the 3-position (beta). This preference is explained by the relative stabilization of the $\\sigma$-complexes:\n- For attack at C-2, the resulting cationic intermediate can delocalize the positive charge over two carbons and onto sulfur, providing more and better-stabilized resonance structures (including one with positive charge on sulfur, which is stabilized by sulfur’s ability to bear positive charge and by overlap with its lone pairs).\n- For attack at C-3, delocalization does not place positive charge on sulfur in an equivalently stabilizing way and leads to fewer stabilizing resonance contributors; thus, the $\\sigma$-complex is less stabilized.\n\nTherefore, kinetic control strongly favors substitution at C-2, leading to thiophene-2-sulfonic acid as the major product under moderate conditions. Under harsher conditions, disulfonation at 2,5 can occur, but at moderate temperature monosulfonation predominates. The options proposing 3-substitution, disulfonation, or loss of aromaticity (dihydrothiophene) are inconsistent with the mechanism and conditions, and “no reaction” is incorrect because thiophene is more reactive than benzene toward EAS.\n\nHence, the major monosubstitution product is thiophene-2-sulfonic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194938"}, {"introduction": "In a reversal of the typical aromatic reactivity, the \"electron-deficient\" nature of pyridine makes its $\\pi$-system susceptible to attack by nucleophiles.

Strong nucleophiles can therefore undergo nucleophilic addition to pyridine at these positions to give nonaromatic, anionic sigma-adducts (Meisenheimer-type intermediates) in which the negative charge is delocalized onto the ring and especially onto the nitrogen atom.\n\nMethyllithium provides a strongly nucleophilic methyl anion equivalent, and in an aprotic solvent the lithium cation can coordinate to the pyridine nitrogen. This coordination both activates the ring toward nucleophilic attack and directs attack to the 2-position (ortho) by chelation control, facilitating a 1,2-addition pathway. The resulting sigma-adduct is the 1-aza-2-methyl-cyclohexa-3,5-dienyl anion (a 1,2-dihydropyridyl anion), in which the negative charge is delocalized and can be represented in resonance forms that place negative charge on nitrogen, providing extra stabilization.\n\nAssessing the options:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because nucleophilic attack at nitrogen is disfavored; the nitrogen is the locus of electron density, and methyl anion is not an electrophile that would alkylate nitrogen. Moreover, N-alkylation would generate a pyridinium cation, not an anion.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it describes deprotonation at C2 by methyl anion and an anion named as if N were methylated; methyllithium is not an electrophile to N-methylate, and simple deprotonation at C2 of unsubstituted pyridine is not the dominant process under these conditions relative to nucleophilic addition. The described species does not match the known initial sigma-adduct of nucleophilic addition.\n\n- Option C corresponds to 4-addition (para). While nucleophilic addition at C4 is possible, the major adduct with organolithiums in aprotic media is typically the 2-addition product due to stronger stabilization and $Li^+$ coordination to nitrogen during attack.\n\n- Option D (3-addition, meta) is disfavored because the LUMO coefficient at C3 is small and the resulting anion is less effectively stabilized by resonance with nitrogen.\n\n- Option E corresponds to 2-addition (ortho), yielding the 1-aza-2-methyl-cyclohexa-3,5-dienyl anion, the well-established Meisenheimer-type adduct for nucleophilic addition of strong carbanions to pyridine under these conditions, and is therefore the best representation of the major anionic intermediate.\n\nHence, the best choice is addition at C2, described in option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2194969"}]}
