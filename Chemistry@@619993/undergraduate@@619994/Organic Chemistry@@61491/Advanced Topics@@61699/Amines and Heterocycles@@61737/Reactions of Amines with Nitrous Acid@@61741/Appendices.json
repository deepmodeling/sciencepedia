When a chiral amine reacts, the resulting product mixture is often neither fully inverted nor completely racemized, a clue that simple mechanistic models are incomplete. This problem challenges you to explain such an observation, pushing you to consider the role of intimate ion pairs versus free carbocations and to appreciate the three-dimensional nature of reaction pathways [@problem_id:2194595].", "problem": "When a pure enantiomeric sample of (R)-2-aminobutane is treated with aqueous sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid at low temperature, a substitution reaction occurs. The unstable intermediate formed rapidly decomposes, liberating nitrogen gas and yielding a mixture of alcohols upon reaction with water. Careful analysis of the resulting alcohol mixture reveals that it consists of 65% (S)-butan-2-ol and 35% (R)-butan-2-ol.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best mechanistic explanation for this specific stereochemical outcome?\n\nA. The carbocation intermediate formed after the loss of nitrogen is not completely free. The departing nitrogen molecule partially shields the front face of the carbocation, favoring nucleophilic attack by water from the rear face.\nB. The reaction proceeds through a direct, one-step SN2 mechanism, where a water molecule acts as a nucleophile and displaces the diazonium group, leading to complete inversion of configuration.\nC. The reaction forms a stable, planar, and fully solvated secondary carbocation intermediate. Water, as a nucleophile, attacks this symmetrical intermediate from either face with equal probability.\nD. To achieve greater stability, the initially formed secondary carbocation undergoes a hydride shift to form a primary carbocation before being attacked by water.\nE. The (S)-butan-2-ol product is thermodynamically more stable than the (R)-butan-2-ol product, and the reaction proceeds to form the products in a ratio that reflects their relative stabilities.", "solution": "The substrate is a chiral, primary aliphatic amine at a secondary stereogenic center. Under aqueous sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid at low temperature, nitrous acid generates the nitrosyl cation, which converts the primary amine into an alkyldiazonium ion at the stereogenic carbon. Aliphatic diazonium ions are unstable and expel nitrogen to form a carbocation at the same carbon. The key mechanistic question is whether this carbocation is a fully solvated, free carbocation or remains as a tight ion pair with the departing nitrogen (and counterion) that can shield one face.\n\nIf the carbocation were fully free and planar, attack by water would occur with equal probability from either face, giving a racemic mixture, i.e., an equal ratio of the two enantiomers. That prediction is $0.50:0.50$, which contradicts the observed $0.65:0.35$ ratio. Therefore, a fully free, fully solvated carbocation (as in option C) cannot explain the data.\n\nIf the reaction proceeded by a direct one-step $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ displacement of the diazonium group by water, the outcome would be complete inversion at the stereocenter, approaching $1.00:0.00$ (all inversion). The observed partial inversion excess $0.65:0.35$ contradicts such a simple $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ pathway (option B).\n\nA hydride shift from a secondary carbocation to a primary carbocation (option D) would be thermodynamically unfavorable and mechanistically unnecessary; moreover, it provides no rationale for the specific enantiomeric excess observed. Likewise, invoking thermodynamic preference of one enantiomer over the other (option E) is invalid in an achiral environment, since enantiomers have identical thermodynamic stabilities; thus product ratios cannot reflect a thermodynamic difference between enantiomers.\n\nThe observed stereochemical outcome is characteristic of ion-pair or solvent-cage effects. After loss of nitrogen begins, the developing carbocation is not completely free; instead, the departing nitrogen molecule and counterion remain in close proximity on one face (an intimate ion pair), partially blocking that face. Water therefore preferentially attacks from the opposite (unshielded) face, giving more inversion than retention. Simultaneously, a fraction of intermediates can escape the cage to a fully solvated, planar carbocation, which is then attacked from either face equally, contributing a racemic component.\n\nThis mixed-pathway model quantitatively explains the data. Let $f$ be the fraction that reacts via the tight ion pair pathway, which yields exclusive inversion from the starting configuration. Let $1-f$ be the fraction that forms a free carbocation, giving a racemic contribution. Then the mole fractions of products are\n$$\nx_{S} = f + \\frac{1-f}{2} = \\frac{1+f}{2}, \\quad x_{R} = \\frac{1-f}{2}.\n$$\nGiven $x_{S} = 0.65$ and $x_{R} = 0.35$, solving\n$$\n\\frac{1+f}{2} = 0.65 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 1+f = 1.3 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; f = 0.30,\n$$\nwhich also gives\n$$\nx_{R} = \\frac{1-f}{2} = \\frac{1-0.30}{2} = 0.35,\n$$\nmatching the observation. Thus, approximately $0.30$ of the reaction proceeds through the tight ion pair that enforces inversion by shielding one face with the departing nitrogen, and $0.70$ proceeds through a free, planar carbocation that racemizes. This is precisely the mechanistic rationale described in option A: the carbocation is not completely free, and the departing nitrogen shields one face, biasing attack from the opposite face and producing an excess of inversion.\n\nTherefore, the best mechanistic explanation is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2194595"}]}
