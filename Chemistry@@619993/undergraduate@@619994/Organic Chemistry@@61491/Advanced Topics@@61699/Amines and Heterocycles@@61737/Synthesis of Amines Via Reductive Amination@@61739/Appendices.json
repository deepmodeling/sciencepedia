Reductive amination is a two-step process (often performed in one pot) where a carbonyl group is converted into an amine. The carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone) first reacts with an amine to form an imine or an iminium ion intermediate. This intermediate is then reduced in situ to form the final amine product. The key insight is that the carbon-nitrogen single bond in the product is located at the exact position of the original carbon-oxygen double bond of the carbonyl group.\n\nThe product of the reaction is given as N,N-dimethyl-3-pentanamine. Let's break down this name to determine its structure.\n- The parent chain is \"pentane,\" which is a five-carbon chain: $C-C-C-C-C$.\n- The locant \"3\" in \"3-pentanamine\" indicates that the amino group is attached to carbon-3 of the pentane chain.\n- The prefix \"N,N-dimethyl\" specifies that there are two methyl groups ($CH_3$) attached to the nitrogen atom of the amino group.\n\nCombining these pieces, the structure of N,N-dimethyl-3-pentanamine is:\n$$CH_3-CH_2-CH(N(CH_3)_2)-CH_2-CH_3$$\n\nThe amine used in the reaction is dimethylamine, $(CH_3)_2NH$. The product has a N,N-dimethylamino group, $-N(CH_3)_2$. The reaction involves forming a bond between a carbon atom from the carbonyl compound and the nitrogen atom from the dimethylamine.\n\nAs established, the C-N bond in the product corresponds to the location of the C=O bond in the reactant. In N,N-dimethyl-3-pentanamine, the nitrogen atom is bonded to carbon-3 of the pentane skeleton. Therefore, the starting carbonyl compound must have had its carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon-3 of a five-carbon chain.\n\nLet's draw the structure of this required carbonyl compound. A five-carbon chain with a carbonyl group at the third position is:\n$$CH_3-CH_2-C(=O)-CH_2-CH_3$$\n\nThis compound is a ketone since the carbonyl group is bonded to two other carbon atoms. Its IUPAC name is 3-pentanone.\n\nLet's verify the molecular formula of 3-pentanone. The structure contains 5 carbon atoms, 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. The molecular formula is $C_5H_{10}O$. This matches the formula given in the problem statement, confirming that 3-pentanone is a valid candidate.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options:\nA. Pentanal: $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2CHO$. Reductive amination with dimethylamine would yield N,N-dimethyl-1-pentanamine. This is incorrect.\nB. 2-Pentanone: $CH_3C(=O)CH_2CH_2CH_3$. Reductive amination with dimethylamine would yield N,N-dimethyl-2-pentanamine. This is incorrect.\nC. 3-Pentanone: $CH_3CH_2C(=O)CH_2CH_3$. Reductive amination with dimethylamine would yield N,N-dimethyl-3-pentanamine. This matches the product described in the problem.\nD. 3-Methyl-2-butanone: $(CH_3)_2CHC(=O)CH_3$. Reductive amination with dimethylamine would yield N,N,3-trimethyl-2-butanamine. This is incorrect.\nE. 2-Methylbutanal: $CH_3CH_2CH(CH_3)CHO$. Reductive amination with dimethylamine would yield N,N,2-trimethyl-1-butanamine. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the initial carbonyl compound must be 3-pentanone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2207028"}, {"introduction": "Effective synthetic design often involves recognizing that multiple pathways can lead to the same target.
