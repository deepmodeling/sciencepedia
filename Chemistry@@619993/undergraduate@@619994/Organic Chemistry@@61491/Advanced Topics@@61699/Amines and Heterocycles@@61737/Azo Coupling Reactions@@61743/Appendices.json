Precursor for diazonium salt: Aniline; Coupling partner: Nitrobenzene", "solution": "We aim to synthesize 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline, which is para-aminoazobenzene. In a standard azo coupling sequence, the first step is diazotization of an aromatic amine to give an aryl diazonium salt, and the second step is electrophilic aromatic substitution (azo coupling) of this diazonium species onto an electron-rich aromatic ring.\n\nKey reaction principles:\n- Only aromatic amines form aryl diazonium salts under nitrosation conditions. Symbolically,\n$$\nArNH_{2} \\xrightarrow[\\text{acid}]{\\text{NaNO}_{2}} ArN_{2}^{+}X^{-}.\n$$\n- Azo coupling is an electrophilic aromatic substitution where the aryl diazonium cation $ArN_{2}^{+}$ acts as the electrophile and couples preferentially at the para (or ortho) position of an activated aromatic ring bearing strong electron-donating groups such as $-NH_{2}$ or $-OH$. The coupling product has the general form\n$$\nAr{-}N{=}N{-}Ar',\n$$\nwith the azo group entering para to the activating substituent on $Ar'$ when available.\n\nStructural logic for the target:\n- The target 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline has one ring that is unsubstituted phenyl (the “phenyldiazenyl” part) and the other ring bearing an $-NH_{2}$ group para to the azo linkage. In azo coupling, the substituents on the coupling partner ring are retained, while the diazonium ring loses its $-NH_{2}$ functionality (converted to $N_{2}^{+}$ and then to the azo bond). Therefore:\n  - The diazonium precursor ring in the final product should be unsubstituted phenyl, which corresponds to generating the diazonium salt from aniline (unsubstituted on the ring aside from $-NH_{2}$).\n  - The coupling partner must already contain $-NH_{2}$ to furnish the para-amino group in the final product, so the coupling partner should be aniline (or a protected variant such as acetanilide in practice; however, among the provided options, aniline is the correct choice).\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Precursor aniline; coupling partner aniline. This yields $C_{6}H_{5}N_{2}^{+}$ coupling para to $-NH_{2}$ on aniline to give 4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline. Correct.\n- B: Coupling partner phenol would give a para-hydroxy azo compound, not the target amine. Incorrect.\n- C: Phenol cannot be diazotized; only aromatic amines form diazonium salts. Incorrect.\n- D: Using 4-nitroaniline as precursor would place a nitro group on the diazonium-derived ring in the product, not present in the target; benzene is too deactivated for efficient coupling. Incorrect.\n- E: Nitrobenzene is strongly deactivated and does not serve as an effective coupling partner. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is aniline as diazonium precursor and aniline as coupling partner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2156369"}, {"introduction": "Once you can identify the building blocks for an azo dye, the next step is to predict the precise structure of the product. This requires an understanding of regioselectivity in electrophilic aromatic substitution, where substituents on the aromatic ring direct the incoming electrophile to specific positions. This exercise [@problem_id:2156416] uses the synthesis of the well-known indicator Methyl Orange to test your ability to apply these directing rules and determine the exact point of connection between the diazonium salt and the coupling partner.", "problem": "In an organic chemistry laboratory, a student is tasked with synthesizing an azo dye known as Methyl Orange, which functions as a common acid-base indicator. The synthesis begins with sulfanilic acid, which has the systematic name 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\nThe sulfanilic acid is first treated with an ice-cold aqueous solution of sodium nitrite ($\\text{NaNO}_2$) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This process, known as diazotization, converts the aromatic primary amine group into a diazonium salt. The resulting diazonium salt solution is then slowly added to a weakly acidic solution of N,N-dimethylaniline, which serves as the coupling partner.\n\nThe reaction between the diazonium salt and N,N-dimethylaniline is an electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Thus, the electrophile for the next step is $\\text{Ar}-\\text{N}_{2}^{+}\\ \\text{X}^{-}$ (where $\\text{X}^{-}$ is the counterion, typically $\\text{Cl}^{-}$).\n\n2) Nature of the coupling reaction:\n- Azo coupling between an aryldiazonium ion (electrophile) and an activated aromatic ring (nucleophile) proceeds via electrophilic aromatic substitution on the activated ring, forming an $\\text{Ar}-\\text{N}=\\text{N}-\\text{Ar}'$ linkage. The bond forms between the diazonium-bearing ring carbon (the carbon that originally held the amino group) and a ring carbon of the activated aromatic partner.\n- The coupling partner is N,N-dimethylaniline, $\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{5}\\text{N}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}$. Under weakly acidic conditions, the dimethylamino group remains largely unprotonated, retaining a lone pair that donates electron density by resonance into the ring. Therefore, $\\text{N}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}$ is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.\n\n3) Regioselectivity on N,N-dimethylaniline:\n- Resonance donation from $\\text{N}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}$ increases electron density and stabilizes the sigma complex most effectively at the ortho and para positions, not at the meta position. Therefore, meta substitution is disfavored.\n- Between ortho and para positions, the para position is typically favored due to reduced steric hindrance and better overlap, particularly in coupling with a bulky electrophile such as an aryldiazonium ion. Thus, the major product arises from para coupling on the N,N-dimethylaniline ring.\n\n4) Position of bond formation on the sulfanilic acid ring:\n- The diazonium electrophile reacts through the diazonium-bearing carbon (the ring carbon that originally bore the amino group). The sulfonic acid group on that ring does not determine the coupling site on the diazonium ring; options implying coupling at a carbon ortho to, or the carbon bearing, the sulfonic acid group are inconsistent with the mechanism. Therefore, the new $\\text{C}-\\text{N}=\\text{N}-\\text{C}$ bond connects at the diazonium carbon of the sulfanilic ring.\n\n5) Conclusion mapping to the options:\n- The major product is the azo compound where the azo bridge connects the diazonium carbon (original amino position) of sulfanilic acid to the carbon para to the dimethylamino group in N,N-dimethylaniline. This corresponds to option A.\n- Ortho coupling on N,N-dimethylaniline (option B) is minor relative to para due to steric effects.\n- Meta coupling (option C) contradicts the ortho/para-directing effect of $\\text{N}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{2}$.\n- Options D and E incorrectly assign the coupling position on the sulfanilic acid ring to carbons other than the diazonium-bearing carbon.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2156416"}, {"introduction": "A mark of a skilled chemist is the ability to anticipate or explain unexpected outcomes. While azo coupling is a robust reaction, its success can be thwarted by factors like extreme steric hindrance. In this thought experiment [@problem_id:2156401], we explore a scenario where the standard electrophilic substitution is blocked, forcing us to consider alternative, competing reaction pathways to correctly predict the major product.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student attempts to perform an azo coupling reaction to synthesize a new dye. The student prepares an ice-cold aqueous solution of benzenediazonium chloride, which serves as the electrophile. For the coupling partner, the student uses 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol dissolved in a suitable solvent, maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature between 0 and 5 degrees Celsius and a pH of approximately 8.\n\nThe student expects to see the formation of a brightly colored precipitate, the azo dye, resulting from an electrophilic aromatic substitution. However, upon workup and analysis, it is found that the standard azo coupling product is not the major species formed. Instead, a different principal organic product derived from the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol starting material is isolated.\n\nFrom the choices below, identify the major organic product that is actually formed from the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol under these conditions.\n\nA. 4-(Phenyldiazenyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol\n\nB. 2-(Phenyldiazenyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol\n\nC. 3,3',5,5'-Tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone\n\nD.

No reaction occurs, and 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol is recovered unchanged.", "solution": "The key mechanistic expectation in azo coupling is electrophilic aromatic substitution of an aryldiazonium salt onto an activated aromatic ring. A phenol is a strong ortho/para director: under mildly basic conditions (pH about 8), partial deprotonation to the phenoxide increases ring nucleophilicity, and coupling typically occurs at the para position to give a para-azo product.\n\nHowever, with 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, steric effects dominate:\n1) The ortho positions are occupied by tert-butyl groups, so ortho coupling is precluded.\n2) The para position is flanked by two bulky tert-butyl groups at the 2 and 6 positions, which imposes severe steric hindrance to approach and planar alignment of the benzenediazonium electrophile necessary for electrophilic aromatic substitution. This greatly suppresses the rate of azo coupling that would give 4-(phenyldiazenyl)-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol.\n\nConcurrently, under the same mildly basic, cold conditions, benzenediazonium salts can serve as one-electron oxidants toward phenoxides. Specifically:\n3) At pH approximately 8, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol is partially converted to its phenoxide, a good single-electron donor.\n4) Single-electron transfer from the phenoxide to the diazonium cation generates a phenoxyl radical and reduces the diazonium, with loss of nitrogen. The hindered 2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxyl radical is unusually stabilized due to steric protection and resonance.\n5) Two such stabilized phenoxyl radicals couple at their least hindered positions, which are the para carbons, forming a C–C bond between the aromatic rings.\n6) Subsequent oxidation under the reaction conditions (the diazonium salt and dissolved oxygen both serve as oxidants) converts the coupled dihydroxy biphenyl intermediate to the corresponding diphenoquinone. For 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, this gives 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone as the principal product.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A (para-azo) is disfavored by severe steric hindrance and loses to the faster radical oxidation pathway.\n- Option B (ortho-azo) is blocked by tert-butyl substituents.\n- Option D (benzene) is unrelated to the observed transformation.\n- Option E (no reaction) is incorrect because oxidation and coupling occur readily for this hindered phenol under these conditions.\n\nThe major product is 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert-butyldiphenoquinone, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2156401"}]}
