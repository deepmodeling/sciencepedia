This practice exercise focuses on applying the fundamental rules of IUPAC nomenclature to name a compound with more than one principal functional group. By determining the systematic name for the naturally occurring diamine, cadaverine, you will practice identifying the parent alkane chain and correctly assigning locants to the amino groups.

It is, along with putrescine, largely responsible for the foul odor of decaying flesh. The chemical structure of cadaverine can be represented as $\\text{H}_2\\text{N}-(\\text{CH}_2)_5-\\text{NH}_2$. Based on the guidelines from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), select the correct systematic name for this compound from the options below.\n\nA. Pentane-1,5-diamine\n\nB. 1,5-Diaminopentane\n\nC. 1,5-Pentanediamine\n\nD. 1-Amino-5-pentanamine\n\nE. Pentane-1,5-diamide", "solution": "Identify the parent hydrocarbon skeleton: the structure $\\text{H}_2\\text{N}-(\\text{CH}_2)_5-\\text{NH}_2$ contains a continuous chain of five carbon atoms, which corresponds to pentane as the parent.\n\nIdentify and count the principal functional groups: there are two primary amino groups (-NH2), one at each end of the chain. Amino groups are the principal characteristic groups here, so the amine suffix is used rather than treating amino as a substituent prefix.\n\nAssign locants to the amino groups: numbering the pentane chain from either end places the amino groups at positions 1 and 5, giving locants 1 and 5.\n\nApply IUPAC suffix rules for multiple identical functional groups: with two amino groups, use the suffix “-diamine,” and place the locants immediately before the suffix as “-1,5-diamine,” attached to the parent name “pentane.” This yields the systematic name “pentane-1,5-diamine.”\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A. Pentane-1,5-diamine: This follows the correct IUPAC format for a diamine with locants placed before the suffix.\n- B. 1,5-Diaminopentane: Uses “diamin-” as a prefix with “pentane” as the parent, which is not the preferred IUPAC suffix-based name when amine is the principal group.\n- C. 1,5-Pentanediamine: Locants are misplaced; IUPAC places locants immediately before the suffix (pentane-1,5-diamine), not before the parent name as written here.\n- D. 1-Amino-5-pentanamine: Incorrect mixed use of prefix and an improperly formed suffix; also the correct suffix form would be “pentan-1-amine,” not “pentanamine,” and duplication is unnecessary since both ends are amines.\n- E. Pentane-1,5-diamide: Refers to amides, not amines, so it denotes a different functional group entirely.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC systematic name is “pentane-1,5-diamine,” corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205520"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond nomenclature, we now explore how an amine's structure dictates its chemical properties. This next practice challenges you to qualitatively rank a series of substituted anilines by basicity, a crucial chemical characteristic. Successfully completing this exercise [@problem_id:2205491] requires you to analyze how electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring influence the availability of the nitrogen's lone pair for protonation, a cornerstone concept in understanding chemical reactivity.", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the effect of substituents on the chemical properties of aromatic amines. Four aniline derivatives are considered:\n- Compound I: Aniline\n- Compound II: p-nitroaniline\n- Compound III: p-methylaniline\n- Compound IV: p-methoxyaniline\n\nYour task is to arrange these four compounds in order of increasing basicity. Basicity in this context refers to the ability of the amino group's nitrogen atom to accept a proton in an acid-base reaction. Which of the following options correctly represents the order from least basic to most basic?\n\nA) II < I < III < IV\n\nB) IV < III < I < II\n\nC) II < I < IV < III\n\nD) I < II < III < IV\n\nE) III < IV < I < II", "solution": "Basicity of an aromatic amine refers to the tendency of the nitrogen lone pair to accept a proton. For an aniline derivative $\\text{ArNH}_2$, the relevant equilibrium is\n$$\\text{ArNH}_2 + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{ArNH}_3^{+},$$\nand basicity increases with greater electron density on the nitrogen lone pair and decreases when that lone pair is rendered less available by delocalization or electron withdrawal. Substituent effects are evaluated via inductive effects ($+I$ donates, $-I$ withdraws) and resonance (mesomeric) effects ($+M$ donates, $-M$ withdraws) transmitted through the aromatic ring.\n\nFor the reference compound, aniline (Compound I), the nitrogen lone pair is partially delocalized into the ring via resonance, which makes aniline less basic than typical aliphatic amines. Substituents at the para position modulate this baseline.\n\nFor p-nitroaniline (Compound II), the $\\text{NO}_2$ group is a strong $-M$ and $-I$ substituent. Its $-M$ effect withdraws electron density from the ring by resonance, which competes with and enhances delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the ring, thereby decreasing its availability for protonation. Its $-I$ effect further withdraws electron density through sigma bonds. Both effects significantly decrease basicity relative to aniline, making II the least basic.\n\nFor p-methylaniline (Compound III), the methyl group is a weak electron donor by $+I$ and hyperconjugation. At the para position, this increases electron density in the ring slightly, which in turn reduces the driving force for nitrogen lone-pair delocalization and modestly increases the availability of the lone pair for protonation. Thus III is slightly more basic than aniline.\n\nFor p-methoxyaniline (Compound IV), the methoxy group exerts a strong $+M$ (resonance donation) effect and a weaker $-I$ effect. At the para position, the $+M$ effect dominates, donating electron density into the ring and raising the electron density at the amino nitrogen indirectly, thereby decreasing the extent of lone-pair delocalization into the ring and increasing its availability for protonation. Consequently, IV is more basic than both aniline and p-methylaniline.\n\nCombining these effects gives the increasing basicity order:\n$$\\text{p-nitroaniline (II)} < \\text{aniline (I)} < \\text{p-methylaniline (III)} < \\text{p-methoxyaniline (IV)},$$\nwhich matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2205491"}, {"introduction": "While qualitative trends are powerful, quantitative comparisons are essential for precise chemical work, such as designing a separation protocol.
