In a laboratory procedure, a solution of sulfanilic acid is treated with sodium nitrite and a cooled mineral acid to form its corresponding aryldiazonium salt. This resulting diazonium salt solution is then divided into two equal portions.\n\nThe first portion is subjected to **Reaction 1**: it is treated with a solution of copper(I) bromide (CuBr).\nThe second portion is subjected to **Reaction 2**: it is gently warmed in its aqueous environment.\n\nLet P1 be the major organic product of Reaction 1, and P2 be the major organic product of Reaction 2.

Let $Ar$ denote the $p$-sulfophenyl ring ($\\text{C}_{6}\\text{H}_{4}$ bearing $\\text{SO}_{3}\\text{H}$ para to the diazonium site). The diazotization step is the standard conversion of a primary aromatic amine to an aryldiazonium salt using nitrous acid generated in situ:\n$$\nAr{-}NH_{2} + HNO_{2} + HX \\longrightarrow Ar{-}N_{2}^{+}X^{-} + 2H_{2}O,\n$$\nwhere $HX$ is the mineral acid and $X^{-}$ is its conjugate base.\n\nFor Reaction 1, the aryldiazonium salt is treated with copper(I) bromide. This invokes the Sandmeyer reaction, in which an aryldiazonium ion is substituted by bromide under catalysis or mediation by $CuBr$, expelling nitrogen gas. The substituent $\\text{SO}_{3}\\text{H}$ is retained because the substitution occurs specifically at the diazonium-bearing ipso carbon:\n$$\nAr{-}N_{2}^{+}X^{-} \\xrightarrow[\\text{}]{CuBr} Ar{-}Br + N_{2} + CuX,\n$$\nso the major product $P1$ is 4-bromobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\nFor Reaction 2, gentle warming of an aryldiazonium salt in aqueous medium leads to hydrolysis of the diazonium group to a phenol, expelling nitrogen.

This exercise moves from simple product prediction to a more nuanced analysis of reaction conditions. You must consider how the pH of the solution alters the electronic nature of the aromatic coupling partner, determining its suitability for electrophilic aromatic substitution and highlighting the importance of a molecule's protonation state in controlling its reactivity.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is tasked with synthesizing an azo dye via an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The student prepares a solution of benzenediazonium chloride ($C_6H_5N_2^+ Cl^-$) in water, buffered to a pH of 2.0. To complete the synthesis, the student must add a \"coupling partner\" to the diazonium salt solution. The student has the following five purified aromatic compounds available:\n\n*   Aniline\n*   Phenol\n*   Nitrobenzene\n*   Toluene\n*   Anisole (methoxybenzene)\n\nThe goal is to select the compound that will react most effectively and rapidly with the benzenediazonium salt under these specific acidic conditions to form the desired azo product.\n\nWhich of the following choices correctly identifies the best coupling partner and provides the most accurate chemical reasoning for its effectiveness at a pH of 2.0?\n\nA. Aniline, because the amino group is a powerful activating group that directs ortho-para substitution.\n\nB. Phenol, because the hydroxyl group remains a strong activating group in the acidic environment.\n\nC. Aniline, because the acidic conditions protonate the diazonium salt, making it more reactive.\n\nD. Nitrobenzene, because its electron-withdrawing nature complements the electrophilic character of the diazonium salt.\n\nE. Phenol, because it is readily deprotonated to the highly reactive phenoxide ion in the acidic solution.", "solution": "The coupling of an aryl diazonium ion with an aromatic ring is an electrophilic aromatic substitution in which the electrophile is the aryl diazonium cation $ArN_{2}^{+}$, and the rate is governed by the nucleophilicity (electron density) of the aromatic partner. Electron-donating substituents activate the ring and direct to ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing substituents deactivate the ring and retard the reaction.\n\nAt $pH=2.0$, acid–base equilibria determine the form and hence the directing/activating power of substituents:\n- For aniline, the relevant equilibrium is $\\text{PhNH}_2 + \\text{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{PhNH}_3^+$. By the Henderson–Hasselbalch relation for a conjugate acid–base pair,\n$$\n\\frac{[\\text{PhNH}_2]}{[\\text{PhNH}_3^+]} = 10^{pH - pK_a(\\text{PhNH}_3^+)}.\n$$\nSince $pH  pK_a(\\text{PhNH}_3^+)$, it follows that $[\\text{PhNH}_2]/[\\text{PhNH}_3^+] \\ll 1$, so aniline is predominantly present as $\\text{PhNH}_3^+$. The $\\text{PhNH}_3^+$ group is not able to donate its lone pair into the ring and is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, making coupling slow to negligible. Therefore, options asserting aniline is best (A and C) fail; moreover, the claim in C about “protonating the diazonium salt” is not pertinent because the electrophile $ArN_{2}^{+}$ is already a cation and further protonation is not the controlling factor for rate.\n- For phenol, the relevant equilibrium is $\\text{PhOH} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{PhO}^- + \\text{H}^+$. The Henderson–Hasselbalch relation gives\n$$\n\\frac{[\\text{PhO}^-]}\n{[\\text{PhOH}]} = 10^{pH - pK_a(\\text{PhOH})}.\n$$\nSince $pH \\ll pK_a(\\text{PhOH})$, we have $[\\text{PhO}^-]/[\\text{PhOH}] \\ll 1$, so phenol remains largely as neutral $\\text{PhOH}$, not as $\\text{PhO}^-$. This directly contradicts option E. However, even as $\\text{PhOH}$, the hydroxyl group donates electron density to the ring by resonance, remaining an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent that promotes azo coupling. Thus, phenol is a good coupling partner under these acidic conditions, supporting option B.\n- Nitrobenzene bears a strongly electron-withdrawing $\\text{NO}_2$ group that deactivates the ring and directs meta; it is a poor substrate for electrophilic aromatic substitution, so D is incorrect.\n\nAmong the given choices, the only substrate that remains activated under $pH=2.0$ and is therefore effective for rapid azo coupling is phenol, and the correct reasoning is that its hydroxyl group continues to activate the ring in this acidic environment, not that it is deprotonated to phenoxide under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2206513"}, {"introduction": "In practical synthesis, achieving a high yield often means minimizing unwanted side reactions. This problem bridges the gap between reaction mechanisms and physical chemistry by exploring how to control product selectivity in a competitive reaction scenario.
