The chosen synthetic route is a Williamson ether synthesis involving a macrocyclization reaction. According to the plan, two molecules of ethylene glycol (C₂H₆O₂) and two molecules of 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂) combine to form one molecule of 12-crown-4 (C₈H₁₆O₄).\n\nIn the laboratory, the chemist starts with 20.0 g of ethylene glycol and 30.0 g of 1,2-dichloroethane, with other reagents like the base being in excess.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers a powerful window into molecular structure and dynamics. This exercise [@problem_id:2165104] challenges you to predict how the ${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR spectrum of 15-crown-5 changes upon binding a sodium ion. Understanding these changes deepens your grasp of molecular symmetry and how complexation alters the chemical environment of protons, providing direct evidence of the host-guest interaction.", "problem": "The cyclic polyether 15-crown-5 has the chemical structure $(\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4\\text{O})_5$. At room temperature, its proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (${}^1\\text{H}$ NMR) spectrum, when recorded in a suitable non-coordinating deuterated solvent, displays a single, sharp signal at approximately 3.6 ppm. This observation indicates that all twenty methylene ($\\text{CH}_2$) protons are chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n\nConsider an experiment where a sodium salt, such as sodium tetrafluoroborate ($\\text{NaBF}_4$), is gradually added to the NMR tube containing the 15-crown-5 solution. It is known that 15-crown-5 can form a stable host-guest complex with the sodium cation ($\\text{Na}^+$).

The single signal remains, but it shifts significantly upfield (to a lower ppm value).\n\nB. The spectrum remains completely unchanged.\n\nC. The single, sharp signal is replaced by a more complex pattern of multiple signals.\n\nD. The signal corresponding to the crown ether protons completely disappears.", "solution": "At room temperature in a non-coordinating deuterated solvent, 15-crown-5, with formula $(\\text{C}_{2}\\text{H}_{4}\\text{O})_{5}$, undergoes rapid conformational averaging that renders all twenty methylene protons chemically equivalent on the ${}^{1}\\text{H}$ NMR timescale. By the principle of time-averaged symmetry in NMR, this produces a single sharp resonance near 3.6 ppm because all $\\text{CH}_{2}$ protons experience the same averaged electronic environment.\n\nUpon addition of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ (e.g., from $\\text{NaBF}_{4}$), the crown ether forms a host-guest complex in which the cation coordinates to the five ether oxygens. This coordination has two qualitative consequences governed by NMR principles:\n1) Symmetry reduction and loss of equivalence: Binding of $\\text{Na}^{+}$ breaks the high effective symmetry of the free macrocycle. The methylene groups become magnetically non-equivalent due to their distinct spatial relationships to the bound cation and to each oxygen; furthermore, within each $\\text{CH}_{2}$ group, the two protons can become diastereotopic in the chiral environment created by the metal coordination. By the principle that chemically non-equivalent protons give distinct resonances, the single signal of the free ligand is replaced by multiple resonances for the complex.\n2) Exchange effects and chemical shift changes: Complexation alters the electronic environment of the $\\text{OCH}_{2}$ protons, typically causing deshielding (a downfield shift to higher ppm) rather than an upfield shift, because electron density is drawn toward the coordinated cation. Depending on the exchange rate between free and bound forms relative to the NMR timescale, one may observe separate sets of signals (slow exchange) or broadened/averaged signals (intermediate to fast exchange). In any case, the spectrum becomes more complex than a single sharp peak as the complex forms.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because an upfield shift is not expected, and the single signal would not generally remain due to reduced symmetry.\n- Option B is incorrect because complexation changes both symmetry and electronic environment.\n- Option C is correct: the single, sharp signal is replaced by a more complex pattern of multiple signals corresponding to the inequivalent protons in the bound complex (and potentially separate free and bound signals).\n- Option D is incorrect because the crown ether protons do not vanish; at most, resonances may broaden, but they remain observable under typical conditions.\n\nThus, the best description is that the single signal is replaced by multiple signals as the complex forms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2165104"}, {"introduction": "Beyond spectroscopy, the formation of a host-guest complex can also manifest as a change in the bulk physical properties of a solution.
