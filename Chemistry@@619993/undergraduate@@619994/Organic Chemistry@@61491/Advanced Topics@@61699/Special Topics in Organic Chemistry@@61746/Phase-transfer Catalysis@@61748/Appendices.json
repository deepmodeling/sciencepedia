By analyzing the difference between the thiocyanate ($SCN^-$) and bisulfite ($HSO_3^-$) anions, you'll uncover the critical and often decisive role that anion hydration energy plays in the success or failure of phase-transfer catalysis. [@problem_id:2189379]", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating nucleophilic substitution reactions on 1-bromooctane using a Phase-Transfer Catalysis (PTC) setup. The reaction system consists of two immiscible phases: an organic phase of 1-bromooctane dissolved in toluene, and an aqueous phase containing the nucleophilic salt. Tetrabutylammonium bromide ($(\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_9)_4\\text{N}^+ \\text{Br}^-$) is used as the phase-transfer catalyst.\n\nTwo parallel experiments are conducted under identical conditions of temperature and stirring:\n\n*   **Experiment A:** The aqueous phase contains sodium thiocyanate ($NaSCN$). After several hours, analysis shows a high yield of the product, octyl thiocyanate.\n*   **Experiment B:** The aqueous phase contains sodium bisulfite ($NaHSO_3$). After the same amount of time, analysis shows that virtually no reaction has occurred, and the 1-bromooctane remains unreacted.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental chemical reason for the success of Experiment A and the failure of Experiment B?\n\nA. The bisulfite anion ($HSO_3^-$) is a significantly weaker nucleophile than the thiocyanate anion ($SCN^-$) in all solvents, making the reaction kinetically unfeasible.\nB. The sodium bisulfite salt is significantly less soluble in the aqueous phase than sodium thiocyanate, resulting in a very low concentration of available nucleophile.\nC. The bisulfite anion ($HSO_3^-$) is highly stabilized by a strong hydration shell in the aqueous phase. The energetic cost to desolvate and transport this hydrophilic anion into the organic phase via the catalyst is prohibitively high compared to the more lipophilic thiocyanate anion.\nD. The bisulfite anion ($HSO_3^-$) acts as a reducing agent, converting the tetrabutylammonium catalyst into an inactive species, thereby halting the catalytic cycle before substitution can occur.\nE. The steric bulk of the pyramidal bisulfite anion ($HSO_3^-$) prevents it from effectively attacking the primary carbon of 1-bromooctane, whereas the linear thiocyanate anion ($SCN^-$) has no such steric impediment.", "solution": "We identify the transformation as an $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ substitution of 1-bromooctane by an anionic nucleophile under phase-transfer catalysis (PTC). The key mechanistic requirement is that the reactive anion must be present in the organic phase where the electrophile (1-bromooctane in toluene) resides. Under quaternary ammonium PTC, the catalyst shuttles anions from the aqueous phase to the organic phase by forming a lipophilic ion pair with the quaternary ammonium cation.\n\nFundamental principle 1 (PTC extraction thermodynamics): The ability of an anion $X^{-}$ to be transferred into the organic phase as $Q^{+}X^{-}$ (with $Q^{+}$ a tetrabutylammonium cation) is governed by a free-energy balance\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(X^{-})=\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv,aq}}(X^{-})+\\Delta G_{\\text{pair}}(Q^{+},X^{-})+\\Delta G_{\\text{solv,org}}(Q^{+}X^{-}),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv,aq}}(X^{-})$ is the free energy to remove the hydration shell of $X^{-}$, $\\Delta G_{\\text{pair}}(Q^{+},X^{-})$ is the free energy of forming the ion pair with the quaternary ammonium cation, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv,org}}(Q^{+}X^{-})$ is the free energy of solvating that ion pair in the organic phase. A smaller (more negative) $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$ leads to higher concentration of $Q^{+}X^{-}$ in the organic phase and thus higher reaction rate.\n\nFundamental principle 2 (hydration and polarizability): Strongly hydrated, hard, oxyanions possess large negative $\\Delta G_{\\text{hydr}}$ in water, so $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv,aq}}$ is large and positive; they resist extraction. Softer, more polarizable, charge-diffuse anions have weaker hydration and lower $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv,aq}}$, and they form more lipophilic ion pairs with $Q^{+}$ that are better solvated in organic media.\n\nApplication to the two anions:\n- For $X^{-} = \\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$ (thiocyanate), the anion is soft and highly polarizable with charge delocalization over sulfur and nitrogen. Consequently, $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv,aq}}(\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})$ is relatively small, $|\\Delta G_{\\text{pair}}(Q^{+},\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})|$ is large due to favorable ion pairing with a bulky lipophilic cation, and $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv,org}}(Q^{+}\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})$ is favorable in toluene. Therefore, $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\mathrm{SCN}^{-})$ is relatively low, allowing significant $Q^{+}\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$ concentration in the organic phase, where $\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$ performs $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$ attack on 1-bromooctane to give octyl thiocyanate.\n- For $X^{-} = \\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ (bisulfite), the anion is a hard, strongly hydrated oxyanion with strong hydrogen-bonding to water and high charge density localized on oxygen. Thus, $\\Delta G_{\\text{desolv,aq}}(\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-})$ is large and positive, and the resulting $Q^{+}\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ ion pair is relatively hydrophilic and poorly solvated in toluene, making $\\Delta G_{\\text{solv,org}}$ unfavorable. Overall, $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}(\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-})$ is large and positive, so essentially no nucleophile is present in the organic phase and no reaction occurs.\n\nEvaluation of the options using these principles:\n- A is incorrect in its absolutist claim \"in all solvents\" and misidentifies the dominant factor under PTC; nucleophilicity scales are solvent-dependent and here the decisive factor is phase transfer, not intrinsic gas-phase nucleophilicity.\n- B is incorrect because both sodium thiocyanate and sodium bisulfite are readily soluble in water; moreover, PTC is designed to overcome phase separation by extracting anions into the organic phase.\n- C correctly identifies the fundamental thermodynamic barrier: the strong hydration of $\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ renders $\\Delta G_{\\text{transfer}}$ prohibitively high relative to $\\mathrm{SCN}^{-}$, preventing effective transport and reaction.\n- D is mechanistically implausible; $\\mathrm{HSO}_{3}^{-}$ does not reduce the quaternary ammonium cation to an inactive species under these conditions.\n- E is not the controlling factor; steric hindrance is minimal for attack at a primary carbon, and the failure arises from transfer/solvation energetics, not sterics.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is the differential hydration and transfer energetics captured in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2189379"}]}
