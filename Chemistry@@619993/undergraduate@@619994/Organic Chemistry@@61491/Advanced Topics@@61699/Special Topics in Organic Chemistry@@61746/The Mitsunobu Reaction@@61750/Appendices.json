The substrate is 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentan-1-one, which has the structure $\\mathrm{Ph\\text{-}CO\\text{-}CH_2\\text{-}CH(OH)\\text{-}C(CH_3)_2\\text{-}CH_3}$. The alcohol is secondary at C3 and is flanked on one side (C4) by a quaternary carbon, creating severe steric hindrance, and on the other side (C2) by a methylene that is $\\alpha$ to a carbonyl, which bears acidic $\\beta$-hydrogens with respect to the putative leaving group at C3.\n\nUnder Mitsunobu conditions with $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$ and DEAD in the presence of benzoic acid, the general mechanistic sequence is:\n1) $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$ adds to DEAD forming a betaine, which then activates the alcohol to the corresponding alkoxyphosphonium salt, $[R-O-PPh_3]^+$. Concurrently, benzoic acid is deprotonated to give the benzoate anion.\n2) From this point, two pathways can compete:\n   - $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ at the hindered secondary center by benzoate to give inversion and the ester $R-CH(OBz)$.\n   - $E_2$ elimination, in which a base (benzoate or the basic betaine) removes a $\\beta$-hydrogen antiperiplanar to the leaving group, expelling the oxyphosphonium and forming an alkene.\n\nAnalysis of the $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ pathway: The electrophilic center is C3, a secondary carbon rendered extremely hindered by the adjacent quaternary center at C4, which strongly raises the barrier to backside attack required for $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$. Thus, the $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ pathway to give 3-(benzoyloxy)-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpentan-1-one is highly disfavored.\n\nAnalysis of the $E_2$ pathway: The leaving group is an excellent leaving group (alkoxyphosphonium), and the only accessible $\\beta$-hydrogens are located at C2 (adjacent to the carbonyl), because C4 is quaternary and lacks hydrogens. The C2 hydrogens are relatively acidic due to $\\alpha$-carbonyl stabilization of the developing carbanion character in the $E_2$ transition state. Therefore, deprotonation at C2 with simultaneous loss of the oxyphosphonium from C3 gives a double bond between C2 and C3. This produces an $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone, which is thermodynamically stabilized by conjugation with the carbonyl. Rotation about the C2–C3 bond in the starting material allows an antiperiplanar arrangement for $E_2$, and the more stable $E$ alkene is formed preferentially due to minimized steric interactions between the large substituents on the double bond.\n\nRegiochemical and stereochemical outcome: Elimination can occur only toward C2 (no hydrogens at C4), giving the conjugated enone $\\mathrm{Ph\\text{-}CO\\text{-}CH=CH\\text{-}C(CH_3)_2\\text{-}CH_3}$. The favored geometry is $E$, written as (E)-4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpent-2-en-1-one.\n\nMatching to the options:\n- A corresponds to the disfavored $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ substitution product.\n- B corresponds to the favored $E_2$ elimination product, the conjugated enone.\n- C, D, and E do not follow from the Mitsunobu manifold for this substrate.\n\nTherefore, the major product is option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2211909"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding reaction mechanisms, a practical chemist must also consider the purification of the final product.
