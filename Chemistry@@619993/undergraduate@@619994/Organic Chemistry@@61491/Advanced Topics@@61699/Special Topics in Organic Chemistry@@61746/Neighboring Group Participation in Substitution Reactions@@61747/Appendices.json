The reaction of Substrate **I** yields an approximately 1:1 mixture of **P_cis** and **P_trans**, while the reaction of Substrate **II** yields **P_trans** as the sole product.", "solution": "Identify the reactive site and leaving group behavior: in both substrates the p-toluenesulfonate (tosylate, OTs) is attached at C1 and is an excellent leaving group. In acetic acid (AcOH), acetolysis proceeds by solvolysis at C1, replacing OTs by acetate. The bromine at C2 remains in place under these conditions because acetic acid is a weak nucleophile and the tosylate leaves more readily.\n\nState the operative mechanism and stereochemical control: the medium favors an $S_N1$-type ionization at C1. However, the adjacent C2–Br exerts neighboring group participation (anchimeric assistance) during ionization. Specifically, as OTs departs from C1, the C2–Br bond donates electron density to form a nonclassical, bridged bromonium-like cation spanning C1 and C2. This anchimeric assistance greatly accelerates ionization and, crucially, stereochemically organizes the intermediate.\n\nDescribe the conformational requirement and accessibility for each diastereomer:\n- For the trans-1,2 substrate (Substrate I), a ring flip can produce a trans-diaxial conformer in which the C2–Br bond is axial and suitably aligned to assist departure of the C1–OTs. Although the diequatorial conformer is thermodynamically favored, the diaxial conformer reacts much faster because of anchimeric assistance, so the reaction proceeds predominantly through the bridged intermediate.\n- For the cis-1,2 substrate (Substrate II), one of the two interconverting axial–equatorial conformers has the C2–Br axial, again enabling anchimeric assistance upon ionization at C1. Thus, despite different ground-state preferences, both diastereomers access the same type of bridged bromonium-like intermediate.\n\nEstablish the product-determining step: acetate attacks the bromonium-like intermediate at C1. Opening of a halonium bridge occurs with backside attack relative to the bridging halogen, i.e., anti to the Br bridge. Therefore, nucleophilic capture at C1 places the incoming OAc on the face opposite to Br. The net result is that the C1–OAc and C2–Br end up trans in the product.\n\nContrast with the alternative (free carbocation) pathway: if a fully free cyclohexyl cation at C1 were operative without neighboring assistance, attack by acetate would occur from both faces to give an approximately 1:1 mixture of cis and trans products. The stereospecific trans outcome observed and predicted here reflects dominant neighboring group participation by Br.\n\nConclude the stereochemical outcome: for both Substrate I (trans) and Substrate II (cis), acetolysis proceeds via a bromonium-like bridged intermediate that enforces anti opening by acetate at C1, yielding trans-2-bromocyclohexyl acetate as the major (indeed, essentially exclusive) product. Hence, both reactions give P_trans.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2184709"}, {"introduction": "While NGP can be a dominant pathway, it often competes with other mechanisms, such as direct bimolecular substitution ($S_{N}2$). This exercise investigates the delicate balance between the internal, NGP-mediated pathway and attack by an external nucleophile. You will analyze how changing the reaction conditions—specifically, the concentration and strength of the external nucleophile—can shift the mechanistic landscape, leading to different stereochemical products (retention vs. inversion) and revealing the competitive nature of these reaction pathways [@problem_id:2184692].", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is studying the solvolysis of optically active (2R,3R)-3-bromo-2-butanol. Two separate experiments are conducted under different conditions.\n\n**Experiment A:** The substrate is dissolved in pure formic acid (HCOOH), a polar protic solvent with very low nucleophilicity. After the reaction is complete, the student isolates the substitution product, (2R,3R)-3-formyloxy-2-butanol, and finds that it is formed with almost complete retention of stereochemistry at the carbon atom C-3, which was originally bonded to the bromine atom.\n\n**Experiment B:** The substrate is dissolved in ethanol containing a high concentration of sodium ethoxide (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$ONa). This medium provides a strongly nucleophilic species, the ethoxide ion (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$O$^{-}$). After this reaction is complete, the student finds that two substitution products are formed: (2R,3R)-3-ethoxy-2-butanol (the retention product) and (2R,3S)-3-ethoxy-2-butanol (the inversion product).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best mechanistic explanation for the difference in stereochemical outcomes between Experiment A and Experiment B?\n\nA. In both solvents, the reaction proceeds via a standard $S_{N}1$ mechanism, forming a planar carbocation that leads to a racemic mixture of products. The difference in observed stereochemistry is likely due to the preferential solvation of one face of the carbocation in formic acid.\n\nB. In formic acid, the reaction is a standard $S_{N}2$ displacement, and the observed retention is the result of a double-inversion process involving the solvent. In the ethoxide/ethanol mixture, the hydroxyl group of the substrate acts as an internal nucleophile, leading to a mix of retention and inversion products.\n\nC. The highly nucleophilic ethoxide in Experiment B exclusively promotes a direct $S_{N}2$ attack, leading to complete inversion. The retention product observed is formed through a subsequent $S_{N}1$ reaction of the initially formed inversion product.\n\nD. In weakly nucleophilic formic acid, the reaction is dominated by neighboring group participation (NGP) where the adjacent hydroxyl group acts as an internal nucleophile, leading to a bridged intermediate and overall retention of configuration. In the strongly nucleophilic ethoxide medium, a direct $S_{N}2$ pathway by the external ethoxide nucleophile competes effectively with the NGP pathway, resulting in a mixture of inversion and retention products.\n\nE. The neighboring group participation mechanism is only possible in non-polar solvents. Since both formic acid and ethanol are polar, the observed retention in Experiment A is an anomaly. The result in Experiment B, a mixture of products, is indicative of a competing E2 elimination pathway.", "solution": "Identify the reaction center and relevant stereochemical element: the reacting stereocenter is C-3, bearing bromine in the starting (2R,3R)-3-bromo-2-butanol, and the observed stereochemical outcomes are measured at C-3 in the substitution products.\n\nState the core mechanistic possibilities and their stereochemical signatures:\n- A direct bimolecular substitution, $S_{N}2$, at C-3 by an external nucleophile proceeds with inversion at C-3.\n- A unimolecular ionization, $S_{N}1$, would generate a planar carbocation at C-3 and typically give racemization, unless constrained by neighboring group participation.\n- Neighboring group participation (anchimeric assistance) by the adjacent C-2 hydroxyl oxygen can occur: the oxygen lone pair intramolecularly attacks C-3 with departure of bromide to form a three-membered cyclic oxonium (a bridged intermediate). Formation of this intermediate involves inversion at C-3. Subsequent ring opening by an external nucleophile at C-3 occurs with backside attack relative to the C-3–O bond in the oxonium ring, producing a second inversion. The net consequence is overall retention at C-3 (double inversion).\n\nAnalyze Experiment A (formic acid, weak nucleophile): Formic acid is a polar protic solvent of very low nucleophilicity. Under these conditions, external $S_{N}2$ displacement at a secondary center is disfavored, and a simple $S_{N}1$ pathway would predict substantial racemization, not the observed high retention. The adjacent hydroxyl can, however, participate intramolecularly: the C-2 oxygen attacks C-3 as bromide leaves, generating the bridged cyclic oxonium. Even weak nucleophiles such as formic acid or formate (after acid-base steps) can open this strained, positively charged ring at C-3 by backside attack to give the formate ester. Because ring formation gives inversion and ring opening gives inversion, the overall process yields retention at C-3, matching the observation. Thus, Experiment A is best explained by neighboring group participation dominating, with a cyclic oxonium intermediate and net retention.\n\nAnalyze Experiment B (ethanol with high [ethoxide], strong nucleophile): The presence of a high concentration of a strong external nucleophile, $\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}}$, makes direct $S_{N}2$ attack at C-3 competitive. This $S_{N}2$ pathway yields inversion at C-3, forming the (2R,3S) product. Simultaneously, the same neighboring group participation pathway operative in Experiment A can still occur, forming the cyclic oxonium followed by ring opening by ethoxide (or ethanol after proton transfers), giving the retention product (2R,3R). The observed mixture of inversion and retention products thus reflects competition between direct external $S_{N}2$ (inversion) and NGP-mediated double inversion (retention).\n\nExclude alternative options:\n- Option A invokes $S_{N}1$ in both media; that would predict racemization at C-3, inconsistent with the near-complete retention in formic acid. Preferential solvation of one face is not a general or sufficient explanation for such high retention.\n- Option B suggests a standard $S_{N}2$ by formic acid with double inversion via the solvent; this is implausible because formic acid is a very weak nucleophile for $S_{N}2$ at a secondary center, and the well-established source of retention here is intramolecular NGP, not sequential external inversions by solvent.\n- Option C claims exclusive $S_{N}2$ giving complete inversion, then a subsequent $S_{N}1$ of the inversion product to account for retention; this is mechanistically strained and does not reflect the established efficiency of NGP in vicinal haloalcohols.\n- Option E incorrectly asserts that NGP requires non-polar solvents and attributes the mixture in Experiment B to E2 competition; the data are substitution products with defined stereochemical outcomes, and NGP is well documented in polar protic media.\n\nTherefore, the best mechanistic explanation is neighboring group participation dominating in weakly nucleophilic formic acid to give retention via a bridged oxonium intermediate, while in strongly nucleophilic ethoxide medium, direct external $S_{N}2$ competes with NGP, giving a mixture of inversion and retention products.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2184692"}, {"introduction": "Beyond stereochemical control, a key signature of NGP is a dramatic increase in reaction rate, an effect known as anchimeric assistance.

The equilibrium between the neutral carboxylic acid (HA) and its conjugate base, the carboxylate anion (A⁻), is governed by its pKa value. The pKa of 4-bromobutanoic acid is given as approximately 4.5.\n\nAt a pH of 2.0, the pH is significantly lower than the pKa (pH << pKa). According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, $\\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}\\right)$, when pH << pKa, the logarithmic term must be large and negative, meaning the concentration of the protonated form, [HA], is much greater than the concentration of the deprotonated form, [A⁻]. Thus, at pH 2.0, the reactant is almost exclusively the neutral 4-bromobutanoic acid. In this form, the nucleophile for the intramolecular SN2 reaction is the neutral hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid. This is a relatively weak nucleophile, resulting in a slow reaction rate, characterized by the rate constant $k_{low\\_pH}$.\n\nAt a pH of 12.0, the pH is significantly higher than the pKa (pH >> pKa). In this case, the logarithmic term in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation must be large and positive, meaning the concentration of the deprotonated form, [A⁻], is much greater than the concentration of the protonated form, [HA]. Therefore, at pH 12.0, the reactant is almost exclusively the 4-bromobutanoate anion. The nucleophile is now the carboxylate anion, which is a much more potent nucleophile compared to the neutral hydroxyl group due to its negative charge. This powerful internal nucleophile can attack the carbon bearing the bromine atom very efficiently, leading to a large rate enhancement.
