Consider the reaction of lithium di-tert-butylcuprate, $((\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C})_2\\text{CuLi}$, with two different alkyl halides: 1-iodopropane and 2-iodopropane. It is experimentally observed that the reaction with 1-iodopropane to form 2,2-dimethylpentane proceeds at a reasonable rate, whereas the corresponding reaction with 2-iodopropane to form 2,2,3-trimethylbutane is extremely slow.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best explanation for this significant difference in reaction rates?\n\nA. The secondary carbocation that would be formed from 2-iodopropane is more stable than the primary carbocation from 1-iodopropane, which disfavors the reaction.\nB. The iodide leaving group is less stable when attached to a secondary carbon compared to a primary carbon, making it more difficult to displace from 2-iodopropane.\nC. The electrophilic carbon in 2-iodopropane is a secondary carbon, which is significantly more sterically hindered and less accessible to the nucleophile than the primary carbon in 1-iodopropane.\nD. The tert-butyl group transferred from the Gilman reagent is a much stronger base than it is a nucleophile, leading exclusively to elimination with secondary halides like 2-iodopropane.\nE. Lithium di-tert-butylcuprate is a sterically bulky reagent, which prevents it from reacting with any alkyl halide more substituted than a methyl halide.", "solution": "Corey–House couplings of lithium dialkylcuprates with alkyl halides proceed by a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution pathway at the electrophilic carbon. The key elementary step can be represented schematically as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R_2CuLi} + \\mathrm{R'}\\text{-}\\mathrm{X} \\to \\mathrm{R}\\text{-}\\mathrm{R'} + \\mathrm{RCu} + \\mathrm{LiX},\n$$\nwhere the carbon–halogen bond in $\\mathrm{R'}\\text{-}\\mathrm{X}$ is displaced via backside attack. This is an $\\mathrm{S_{N}2}$-type process, which is highly sensitive to steric hindrance at the electrophilic carbon: $\\text{primary} \\gg \\text{secondary} \\gg \\text{tertiary}$ for substitution.\n\nApply this to the two substrates:\n- With 1-iodopropane (primary), the electrophilic carbon is minimally hindered, allowing the bulky $t\\text{-Bu}$ group from $((\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C})_2\\text{CuLi}$ to approach and displace iodide efficiently, forming 2,2-dimethylpentane at a reasonable rate.\n- With 2-iodopropane (secondary), the electrophilic carbon bears two methyl substituents that block the required backside trajectory for substitution. Combined with the intrinsic bulk of the tert-butyl cuprate, this steric congestion drastically elevates the activation barrier, making the reaction extremely slow.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because the mechanism is not $\\mathrm{S_{N}1}$; no carbocation intermediate is formed, so carbocation stability is irrelevant.\n- B is incorrect because iodide is an excellent leaving group irrespective of primary versus secondary substitution; leaving group ability does not become worse at secondary carbon to account for the large rate drop.\n- C is correct: the secondary electrophilic carbon in 2-iodopropane is significantly more sterically hindered and less accessible for backside attack than the primary carbon in 1-iodopropane, accounting for the observed rate difference.\n- D is incorrect because cuprates are less basic and more nucleophilic than the corresponding organolithiums; while elimination can compete with more substituted halides, the dominant reason for the sluggish substitution here is steric hindrance, not exclusive elimination due to strong basicity.\n- E is incorrect because Gilman reagents routinely couple with primary alkyl halides; they are not restricted to methyl halides only.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is the steric hindrance at the secondary electrophilic center in 2-iodopropane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2173231"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of the reaction's mechanistic preferences, we can now design efficient carbon-carbon bond forming reactions using the Corey-House synthesis.
