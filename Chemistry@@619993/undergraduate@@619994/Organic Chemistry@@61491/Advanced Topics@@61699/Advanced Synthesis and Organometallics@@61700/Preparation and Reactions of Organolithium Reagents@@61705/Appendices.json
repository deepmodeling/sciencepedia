To achieve this, a titration is performed under an inert atmosphere. A 5.00 mL aliquot of the n-BuLi solution is withdrawn and dissolved in 20 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). A small amount of 1,10-phenanthroline is added as an indicator, which complexes with the n-BuLi to form a deep reddish-brown solution. This mixture is then titrated against a standardized 0.485 M solution of sec-butanol in anhydrous THF. The endpoint of the titration is reached when the reddish-brown color permanently disappears, which occurs after the addition of 12.7 mL of the sec-butanol solution.\n\nAssuming the reaction between n-butyllithium and sec-butanol proceeds with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, calculate the molarity of the original commercial n-butyllithium solution.
