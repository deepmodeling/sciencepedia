In this reaction, the normally electrophilic carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde is converted into a nucleophile. This is achieved by first reacting the aldehyde with 1,3-propanedithiol to form a cyclic thioacetal, known as a 1,3-dithiane. The C-H bond at the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is sufficiently acidic to be deprotonated by a strong base, such as n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), to form a stabilized carbanion. This dithianyl anion can then act as a nucleophile, reacting with a primary alkyl halide in an $S_{\\text{N}}2$ reaction.

Propanal reacts with 1,3-propanedithiol under acid catalysis (p-toluenesulfonic acid) to form a 1,3-dithiane via acetal formation, protecting the carbonyl as a dithiane. The product is the propanal-derived 2-substituted 1,3-dithiane (Compound A).\n\nStep 2: Generation of the acyl anion equivalent. Treatment of Compound A with one equivalent of n-butyllithium in dry tetrahydrofuran at low temperature deprotonates the acidic C-2 position of the dithiane to give the corresponding 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane. This species is a nucleophilic acyl anion equivalent.\n\nStep 3: Attempted alkylation with tert-pentyl bromide fails by $S_{\\text{N}}2$ and proceeds by $E2$. The electrophile is 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, a tertiary alkyl bromide. Tertiary alkyl halides are not viable substrates for $S_{\\text{N}}2$ due to severe steric hindrance; therefore the 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane (and any residual strong base such as n-butyllithium) acts as a base, not as an $S_{\\text{N}}2$ nucleophile.

After the $E2$ consumes the tertiary bromide, no alkylation of the dithiane occurs. Upon standard aqueous workup, the 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane is protonated, regenerating Compound A, which is observed as one of the major products.
