This problem presents a thought experiment comparing two different methods for hydrating the same alkene. By investigating why acid-catalyzed hydration and oxymercuration-demercuration lead to different products, we can appreciate the profound impact that reaction intermediates, specifically the potential for carbocation rearrangements, have on regioselectivity.

Pathway A involves treating the alkene with water in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. Pathway B is a two-step sequence, starting with the reaction of the alkene with mercury(II) acetate in an aqueous solution, followed by a reduction step using sodium borohydride.\n\nThe student correctly predicts that the major organic product from Pathway A will be a constitutional isomer of the major organic product from Pathway B, due to a difference in their reaction mechanisms.\n\nWhich of the following compounds is the major organic product formed via Pathway A?\n\nA. 3,3-dimethylbutan-1-ol\nB. 2,2-dimethylbutan-1-ol\nC. 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol\nD. 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol\nE. 4-methylpentan-2-ol", "solution": "Interpret the substrate as 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, i.e., a but-1-ene backbone with two methyl groups on carbon 3. Consider the two hydration mechanisms.\n\nFor Pathway B (oxymercuration-demercuration), addition of water occurs in Markovnikov fashion without carbocation rearrangement. Thus, the hydroxyl group adds to the more substituted alkene carbon (carbon 2), giving the secondary alcohol 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol. This corresponds to option C and will be a constitutional isomer of the Pathway A product if rearrangement occurs in Pathway A.\n\nFor Pathway A (acid-catalyzed hydration with catalytic $\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4$ in water), proceed stepwise:\n1) Protonation of the double bond occurs such that the more stable carbocation forms. Proton adds to carbon 1, generating a secondary carbocation at carbon 2 adjacent to the quaternary carbon at carbon 3.\n2) A $1,2$-methyl shift from carbon 3 to carbon 2 occurs because carbon 3 is quaternary and migration creates a more stable tertiary carbocation at carbon 3. The positive charge relocates from carbon 2 to carbon 3 after the methyl migration.\n3) Water attacks the tertiary carbocation at carbon 3, followed by deprotonation, yielding a tertiary alcohol with the hydroxyl on carbon 3.\n\nTo name the rearranged product, choose the longest chain containing the hydroxyl group. A suitable chain is a four-carbon chain through the tertiary center; numbering to give the hydroxyl the lowest possible number places the OH at carbon 2 and reveals methyl substituents at carbons 2 and 3, i.e., 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol. This is a constitutional isomer of 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol (the Pathway B product), consistent with the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the major product via Pathway A is 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2196136"}, {"introduction": "Beyond determining *where* atoms connect, we must also consider their arrangement in three-dimensional space—a concept known as stereoselectivity. This exercise shifts our focus to the stereochemical outcome of an addition reaction to a cyclic alkene. Catalytic hydrogenation is a stereospecific process, and by understanding its mechanism, we can precisely predict the 3D geometry of the product formed from a *syn*-addition.

The product is a mixture of diastereomers.\nE. The starting material is unreactive under these conditions and no product is formed.", "solution": "Catalytic hydrogenation of an alkene with $\\text{H}_2$ over Pd/C proceeds by adsorption of the alkene onto the metal surface, followed by delivery of two hydrogen atoms to the same face of the double bond. This is a stereospecific syn addition: both new C–H bonds form on the same face of the former $\\pi$ bond.\n\nLet the alkene carbons of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene be $C_1$ and $C_2$. Upon syn addition, both hydrogens are delivered to, say, the top face of the double bond. Consequently, at each of $C_1$ and $C_2$, the newly added H is on the same face (both up), and the pre-existing substituent on that carbon (the methyl group) is oriented on the opposite face (both down). Therefore, in the product, the two methyl groups are on the same face of the ring relative to each other; this is the cis-1,2 relationship.\n\nThe product thus formed is cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. For 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes with identical substituents, the cis isomer possesses an internal plane of symmetry in an appropriate chair conformation (one methyl axial up and the other methyl equatorial up, or both down in the ring-flipped form). Hence, cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane is a meso compound and is optically inactive.\n\nBecause hydrogenation on Pd/C is stereospecific syn addition, only the cis isomer is formed; the trans-1,2 isomer (which would be a pair of enantiomers) is not produced under these conditions. Addition from the opposite face of the alkene gives the same meso product by symmetry, so the outcome is a single, optically inactive meso compound rather than a racemic mixture or a mixture of diastereomers. The starting cyclohexene is reactive under these conditions, so no unreacted starting material remains.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the product is a single, optically inactive meso compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2196110"}]}
