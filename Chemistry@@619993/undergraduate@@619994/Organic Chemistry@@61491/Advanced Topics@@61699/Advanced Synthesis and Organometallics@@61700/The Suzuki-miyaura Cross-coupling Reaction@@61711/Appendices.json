The synthesis will be accomplished via a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The readily available starting aryl halide is 1,4-dibromobenzene.

Starting from 1,4-dibromobenzene, the synthesis requires replacing both C–Br bonds with phenyl groups. The Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction forms a biaryl bond by coupling an aryl halide with an aryl organoboron reagent in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base, proceeding via oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Pd(0), transmetalation with the organoboron reagent, and reductive elimination to forge the C–C bond.\n\nTo introduce a phenyl group, the appropriate organoboron reagent is phenylboronic acid, $Ph-B(OH)_2$. Each C–Br bond requires one equivalent of the organoboron reagent to undergo coupling.

By analyzing the impact of substituents on the transmetalation step, you develop a more nuanced, mechanistic view of the catalytic cycle.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is designing a synthesis of a biaryl compound via a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The plan is to couple bromobenzene with an appropriate organoboron reagent. In the chemical storeroom, two potential reagents are available: Phenylboronic acid and 2,6-Dimethylphenylboronic acid. Assuming all other reaction conditions (catalyst, base, solvent, temperature) are identical and optimized for the reaction, the student must select the reagent that will result in a significantly faster reaction rate to ensure the synthesis is completed in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the more reactive boronic acid and provides the correct mechanistic justification for its enhanced reactivity compared to the other?\n\nA. Phenylboronic acid will react faster because it is less sterically hindered, which allows for a more facile transmetalation step with the arylpalladium(II) intermediate.\n\nB. 2,6-Dimethylphenylboronic acid will react faster because the inductive effect of the two electron-donating methyl groups increases the nucleophilicity of the aryl ring, accelerating the transmetalation step.\n\nC. 2,6-Dimethylphenylboronic acid will react faster because its steric bulk promotes the reductive elimination step, which is the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle.\n\nD. Phenylboronic acid will react faster because the absence of substituents makes the oxidative addition of the boronic acid to the palladium(0) catalyst more efficient.\n\nE. Both reactions will proceed at approximately the same rate because the rate-determining step for Suzuki couplings is always the oxidative addition of the aryl halide, which is bromobenzene in both cases.", "solution": "The Suzuki-Miyaura catalytic cycle for coupling an aryl bromide with an arylboronic acid proceeds through three fundamental steps: (i) oxidative addition of the aryl bromide (here, bromobenzene) to a palladium(0) complex to form an arylpalladium(II) bromide, (ii) transmetalation in which the aryl group from the organoboron reagent is transferred to the palladium center (typically via a base-activated boronate intermediate), and (iii) reductive elimination from a diarylpalladium(II) intermediate to forge the biaryl bond and regenerate palladium(0).\n\nUnder otherwise identical and optimized conditions, the identity of the boronic acid affects the transmetalation step, not the oxidative addition of the aryl bromide. Oxidative addition involves bromobenzene and palladium(0) and is independent of which boronic acid is present. Reductive elimination for aryl-aryl couplings is typically fast relative to the other steps and rarely rate-determining under standard Suzuki conditions.\n\nThe transmetalation step requires formation of a tetracoordinate boronate and approach of the arylboronate to the arylpalladium(II) center. Steric hindrance around the aryl group of the boronic acid retards both boronate formation and the approach/transfer to palladium. Phenylboronic acid is less sterically hindered than 2,6-dimethylphenylboronic acid, which bears two ortho methyl groups that increase steric bulk and impede transmetalation. Consequently, phenylboronic acid generally undergoes faster transmetalation and thus a faster overall reaction under identical conditions.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is correct: it identifies phenylboronic acid as more reactive and correctly attributes the rate enhancement to reduced steric hindrance facilitating transmetalation.\n- B is incorrect: invoking increased nucleophilicity of the aryl ring by inductive donation from methyl groups is not the controlling factor for Suzuki transmetalation; steric effects dominate, and ortho substituents typically slow transmetalation.\n- C is incorrect: while steric bulk can promote reductive elimination, reductive elimination is typically not the rate-determining step for aryl-aryl Suzuki couplings under standard conditions.\n- D is incorrect: boronic acids do not undergo oxidative addition to palladium(0); oxidative addition involves the aryl halide (bromobenzene).\n- E is incorrect: the rate-determining step is not always oxidative addition; for many Suzuki couplings, especially with aryl bromides, transmetalation can be rate-limiting and is sensitive to sterics of the boronic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2213462"}, {"introduction": "The true power of modern organic synthesis lies in the ability to control stereochemistry, and the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction is no exception. This advanced problem [@problem_id:2213453] delves into the sophisticated topic of asymmetric catalysis to create axially chiral biaryls, or atropisomers. You are asked to pinpoint the enantiodetermining step of the catalytic cycle and explain how a chiral ligand orchestrates the formation of a single enantiomeric product, a hallmark of state-of-the-art synthetic methodology.", "problem": "In a modern synthetic laboratory, the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction is a cornerstone for constructing carbon-carbon bonds. A particularly challenging application is the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral biaryls, where rotation around the central C-C bond is restricted due to large ortho-substituents, giving rise to stable, non-interconverting enantiomers called atropisomers.\n\nConsider the coupling of 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene with 1-naphthaleneboronic acid, catalyzed by a system formed from a palladium(II) acetate precatalyst and the chiral ligand (R)-BINAP, which is (R)-(+)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl. The reaction proceeds in the presence of a suitable base to yield a single atropisomeric product in high enantiomeric excess.\n\nThe (R)-BINAP ligand possesses C2 symmetry and creates a chiral environment around the palladium center. The four phenyl groups on its two phosphorus atoms define the steric nature of this environment. Given the standard catalytic cycle for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction (Oxidative Addition, Transmetalation, Reductive Elimination), which of the following statements provides the most accurate and widely accepted mechanistic rationale for the high degree of enantioselectivity observed in the formation of the axially chiral biaryl product?\n\nA. The enantiodetermining step is the reductive elimination from the square-planar Pd(II) intermediate, [Pd((R)-BINAP)(aryl1)(aryl2)]. The C2-symmetric ligand creates a chiral pocket that forces the two ortho-substituted aryl groups into a conformationally restricted arrangement. Of the two possible diastereomeric transition states leading to the two atropisomers, one is significantly destabilized by a severe steric clash between an ortho-methyl group of the benzene ring and one of the phenyl groups of the BINAP ligand, thus favoring the pathway to a single atropisomeric product.\n\nB. The enantiodetermining step is the transmetalation. The chiral palladium(II) complex, [Pd((R)-BINAP)(aryl1)(Br)], preferentially binds to and accepts the naphthyl group from only one of the two enantiotopic faces of the trigonal planar 1-naphthaleneboronic acid, establishing the chirality before the final bond is formed.\n\nC. The enantiodetermining step is the oxidative addition. The chiral Pd(0) complex, [Pd((R)-BINAP)], recognizes and adds to the carbon-bromine bond from only one of the two enantiotopic faces of the 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene substrate, thereby setting the absolute configuration of the final product at the very beginning of the catalytic cycle.\n\nD. The selectivity arises from a pre-equilibrium between the two possible diastereomeric ground-state intermediates, [Pd((R)-BINAP)(aryl1)(aryl2)], just before reductive elimination. The final product ratio simply reflects the thermodynamic populations of these two intermediates, with one being much more stable than the other due to minimized steric repulsion in the ground state.\n\nE. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic resolution of the starting 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene. The chiral catalyst reacts significantly faster with one of the two rapidly interconverting enantiomers of the aryl bromide, which transiently exist due to pyramidalization at the bromine-bound carbon, leading to the observed enantioselectivity.", "solution": "We begin from the standard Suzuki–Miyaura catalytic cycle comprising oxidative addition (OA) of the aryl halide to a Pd(0)–ligand complex to give a Pd(II)–aryl–halide species, transmetalation (TM) with a base-activated boron reagent to generate a Pd(II)–diaryl intermediate, and reductive elimination (RE) to form the biaryl product and regenerate Pd(0). The axial chirality of the product arises only upon formation of the biaryl C–C bond; therefore, the step that forges this bond (RE) is the natural locus for enantiodetermination in atropselective biaryl coupling.\n\nKey stereochemical principle: Prior to C–C bond formation, no axial chirality is present in the substrate or intermediate; only after the two aryls become bonded is an axis of chirality established. As such, OA and TM cannot, in a direct sense, “set” the axial configuration of the final biaryl. Instead, enantioselection most plausibly arises from differences in the diastereomeric transition states for RE of the square-planar Pd(II)–diaryl complex bound to a chiral ligand such as (R)-BINAP, which presents a C2-symmetric, sterically anisotropic environment (quadrant model).\n\nEvaluate option A: The proposal that the enantiodetermining step is RE from a square-planar Pd(II) intermediate, with (R)-BINAP imposing a chiral pocket so that one RE transition state is strongly destabilized by steric clash (here, between an ortho-methyl on the 2,6-dimethylphenyl and a BINAP phenyl) is consistent with widely accepted mechanistic models for atropselective biaryl formation under Pd–BINAP catalysis. In a square-planar Pd(II)–diaryl complex, the two aryl ligands occupy cis positions; their relative orientations within the chiral steric quadrants of BINAP generate two diastereomeric RE transition states leading to opposite atropisomers. The large ortho substituents accentuate steric repulsions in one diastereomeric transition state, increasing its activation free energy. Under Curtin–Hammett control, the product ratio is determined by the difference in these transition-state free energies:\n$$\n\\frac{[P_{R}]}{[P_{S}]} \\approx \\frac{k_{R}}{k_{S}} = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the difference in activation free energies for the two RE pathways. This rationale directly explains high enantioselectivity as kinetic (transition-state) control in the RE step and aligns with experimental and computational precedents.\n\nEvaluate option B: TM transfers the naphthyl group to Pd to form the diaryl Pd(II) intermediate. However, the naphthaleneboronic acid is achiral, and the concept of “enantiotopic faces” of a planar aryl boronic acid is not applicable in a way that sets axial chirality of the eventual biaryl. Even if TM generates diastereomeric Pd(II)–diaryl intermediates, extensive data and the logic of axial chirality formation show that enantioselection is determined at RE, not by facial selectivity at boron during TM. Therefore, TM is not the enantiodetermining step in the widely accepted mechanism for this class of reactions.\n\nEvaluate option C: OA of Pd(0)–(R)-BINAP into an aryl–Br bond of 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene yields a Pd(II)–aryl–Br complex but does not form the axial bond that defines the atropisomer. The substrate is achiral and does not present two enantiotopic faces in a manner that would set an axial configuration during OA. Thus, OA does not control the absolute configuration of the final atropisomer.\n\nEvaluate option D: A purely ground-state population control model (pre-equilibrium of diastereomeric Pd(II)–diaryl intermediates reflected directly in the product ratio) is contrary to the Curtin-Hammett principle under typical conditions. If the diastereomeric intermediates interconvert faster than RE, the product distribution reflects the relative RE transition-state free energies, not the relative ground-state stabilities. Empirically and computationally, atropselectivity in these systems correlates with RE transition-state energetics rather than ground-state intermediate populations.\n\nEvaluate option E: There is no kinetic resolution of 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene because it is not chiral; the notion of “rapidly interconverting enantiomers” via pyramidalization at an sp2 carbon bearing bromine is chemically unfounded. Hence this option is incorrect.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate and widely accepted rationale is that enantioselectivity arises in the reductive elimination step from a chiral, C2-symmetric BINAP–Pd(II)–diaryl complex, where one diastereomeric transition state is destabilized by severe steric clash between the ortho substituents and the BINAP phenyl groups.
