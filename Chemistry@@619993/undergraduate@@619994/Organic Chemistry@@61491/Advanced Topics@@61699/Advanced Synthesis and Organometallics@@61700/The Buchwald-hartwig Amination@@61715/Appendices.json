Iodobenzene and N,N-dimethylaniline\n\n", "solution": "We need to form an aryl C-N bond via a Buchwald-Hartwig amination to obtain N-benzyl-N-methylaniline. The Buchwald-Hartwig amination couples an aryl (pseudo)halide, typically denoted as Ar-X, with an amine nucleophile that must bear at least one N-H bond. The general outcome is the formation of an Ar-N bond, increasing the degree of substitution at nitrogen by replacing the N-H with Ar. Therefore:\n- The aryl fragment (the aniline ring) must come from an aryl halide such as bromobenzene or iodobenzene.\n- The amine partner must be primary or secondary (i.e., with at least one N-H), and it must already carry the other two nitrogen substituents required in the product after arylation if a tertiary amine is the target.\n\nThe target, N-benzyl-N-methylaniline, is a tertiary aniline in which nitrogen is bonded to an aryl group, a benzyl group, and a methyl group. Accordingly, the Buchwald-Hartwig step should couple an aryl halide (to deliver the aniline aryl group) with a secondary amine that already contains benzyl and methyl substituents (and one N-H to participate in the coupling). Evaluate each option:\n\n- A. Bromobenzene (Ar-X) and N-benzyl-N-methylamine (a secondary amine, i.e., benzylmethylamine, R-CH_{2}-NH-CH_{3}). This amine has one N-H and carries benzyl and methyl substituents. Coupling installs the aryl group on nitrogen to give the desired tertiary amine, N-benzyl-N-methylaniline. This matches the Buchwald-Hartwig requirements.\n\n- B. Aniline and benzyl bromide. This is an alkylation of aniline with an alkyl halide, not a Buchwald-Hartwig aryl C-N coupling. It does not use an aryl halide and thus is not the specified transformation.\n\n- C. N-methylaniline and benzyl chloride. Again, this is an alkylation using an alkyl halide rather than an aryl halide; it is not a Buchwald-Hartwig amination.\n\n- D. Benzylamine and bromobenzene. This would form N-benzylaniline (a secondary amine) by coupling Ar-X with a primary amine. It lacks the methyl substituent, so it does not give the target.\n\n- E. Iodobenzene and N,N-dimethylaniline. N,N-dimethylaniline is a tertiary amine and has no N-H bond; Buchwald-Hartwig amination requires an N-H. Thus this combination is not viable.\n\nTherefore, the only valid combination for the specified Buchwald-Hartwig step to form N-benzyl-N-methylaniline is bromobenzene with N-benzyl-N-methylamine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "Once you can identify the correct starting materials, the next step is to predict how readily they will react.

Both compounds will react at nearly the same rate, as the rate is primarily determined by the carbon-chlorine bond strength, which is not significantly affected by the para-substituent.\nD. 4-nitrochlorobenzene, because the nitro group is a Lewis base that can coordinate to the palladium catalyst, thereby increasing the effective local concentration of the catalyst near the reaction site.\nE. 4-methoxychlorobenzene, because the electron-donating methoxy group increases the nucleophilicity of the aromatic ring, facilitating the initial interaction with the catalyst.\n\n", "solution": "We analyze the Buchwald-Hartwig amination mechanism under identical conditions for two aryl chlorides: 4-nitrochlorobenzene and 4-methoxychlorobenzene. The canonical catalytic cycle involves:\n- Oxidative addition of the aryl chloride to a Pd(0) complex to give an aryl–Pd(II)–Cl species.\n- Amine coordination and deprotonation to form an aryl–Pd(II)–amido complex.\n- Reductive elimination to form the C–N bond, regenerating Pd(0).\n\nFor aryl chlorides, the oxidative addition step is commonly rate-determining because the C–Cl bond is strong and its activation is highly sensitive to the electronic nature of the aryl ring. In oxidative addition of Pd(0) into an aryl C–Cl bond, Pd donates electron density into the $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital of the C–Cl bond while accepting back-donation; in the transition state, there is significant polarization with partial positive character at the aryl ipso carbon and developing chloride departure. An electron-withdrawing substituent on the aromatic ring stabilizes this transition state by:\n- Lowering the energy of the $\\sigma^{*}_{\\text{C–Cl}}$ orbital, improving overlap and facilitating insertion.\n- Increasing the electrophilicity at the ipso carbon, which favors bond polarization during oxidative addition.\n\nBy contrast, an electron-donating substituent raises the aryl ring electron density, making the aryl carbon less electrophilic and the C–Cl bond less susceptible to oxidative addition.\n\nThis trend is captured by Hammett correlations for oxidative addition of aryl halides to Pd(0), often showing a positive reaction constant $\\rho$ in the relation\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{k}{k_{0}}\\right)=\\rho\\,\\sigma,\n$$\nindicating that substituents with positive $\\sigma$ (electron-withdrawing) increase the rate constant $k$ relative to $k_{0}$.\n\nApplying this to the two substrates:\n- 4-nitrochlorobenzene bears a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group, which accelerates oxidative addition.\n- 4-methoxychlorobenzene bears a strongly electron-donating methoxy group, which retards oxidative addition.\n\nTherefore, 4-nitrochlorobenzene would react faster. Evaluating the options:\n- A correctly attributes the increased rate to the electron-withdrawing nitro group enhancing susceptibility to oxidative addition.\n- B is incorrect because electron donation generally slows oxidative addition of aryl chlorides.\n- C is incorrect; para substituents significantly modulate rate beyond intrinsic C–Cl bond strength.\n- D is incorrect; the nitro group is a poor ligand for Pd under these conditions and coordination is not the primary cause of rate acceleration.\n- E is incorrect; nucleophilicity of the aromatic ring is not the key factor in oxidative addition to Pd(0).\n\nHence the best explanation is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "In practice, chemical reactions often have competing pathways that can lead to undesired side-products, and a key skill for a chemist is to anticipate and understand them.

Subsequent steps (e.g., imine fragmentation or further base-promoted processes) lead to N-dealkylation and release of an alkene derived from the sec-butyl group.\n\nAmong possible C4H8 isomers, elimination from a sec-butyl fragment most favorably yields the more substituted and more thermodynamically stable internal alkene, but-2-ene, rather than but-1-ene.
