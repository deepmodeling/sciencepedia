Consider the reaction of 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene with exactly one equivalent of phenylacetylene in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst, a copper(I) co-catalyst, and a base.

No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "1) Identify the reactive sites and reagents. The substrate 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene contains two aryl carbon–halogen bonds, C–Br and C–Cl. The Sonogashira coupling joins a terminal alkyne (phenylacetylene) to an aryl or vinyl halide under Pd/Cu catalysis and base.\n\n2) Establish chemoselectivity based on oxidative addition rates. The key step controlling which carbon–halogen bond reacts is oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Pd(0). The well-established reactivity order for aryl halides toward Pd(0) oxidative addition under standard Sonogashira conditions is\n$$\n\\text{Ar–I} \\;>\\; \\text{Ar–Br} \\;\\gg\\; \\text{Ar–Cl}.\n$$\nTherefore, in a mixed dihalide containing Br and Cl, the Pd catalyst inserts selectively into the C–Br bond, not the C–Cl bond, under typical conditions.\n\n3) Consider stoichiometry and single-coupling conditions. The problem specifies exactly one equivalent of phenylacetylene and conditions that favor a single coupling event. Thus, only one aryl–halogen bond will be replaced by the alkynyl group, and the other halogen remains intact.\n\n4) Outline the catalytic sequence consistent with this selectivity:\n- Base deprotonates phenylacetylene to give the acetylide, which is captured by Cu(I) to form a copper acetylide.\n- Pd(0) undergoes oxidative addition into the aryl C–Br bond of 1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene to form an aryl–Pd(II)–Br complex.\n- Transmetalation transfers the alkynyl group from Cu to Pd, yielding an aryl–Pd(II)–alkynyl species.\n- Reductive elimination forms the aryl–alkynyl C–C bond and regenerates Pd(0), leaving the chlorine substituent untouched.\n\n5) Deduce the structure of the product. Since coupling occurs at the aryl bromide position and only one coupling occurs, the bromine is replaced by the phenylethynyl group while the chlorine remains para to it. The product is 1-chloro-4-(phenylethynyl)benzene.\n\n6) Match to the provided options. This corresponds to option B. Options A and D are inconsistent with selectivity or substitution pattern; option C requires two coupling events; option E is incorrect because standard Sonogashira conditions do effect coupling at aryl bromides.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2212942"}, {"introduction": "This final challenge invites you to step into the role of a mechanistic chemist and interpret experimental data to probe the reaction's inner workings. You will analyze a \"broken\" Hammett plot, a classic tool in physical organic chemistry, to explain how substituent electronic effects can alter a reaction's rate-determining step [@problem_id:2212971]. This exercise demonstrates how kinetic studies provide deep insights into the complex catalytic cycle of the Sonogashira coupling.", "problem": "A research team is investigating the kinetics of a palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction. The specific reaction involves coupling phenylacetylene with a series of *para*-substituted aryl bromides (p-Z-C₆H₄-Br), where Z represents different substituent groups. The reaction is conducted under identical conditions for each substituent, using a Pd(PPh₃)₂Cl₂/CuI catalytic system.\n\nThe generally accepted catalytic cycle for the Sonogashira coupling involves three principal steps:\n1.  **Oxidative Addition (OA):** The Pd(0) active catalyst inserts into the aryl-bromide bond.\n2.  **Transmetalation (TM):** The acetylide group is transferred from a copper(I) acetylide intermediate to the palladium(II) center.\n3.  **Reductive Elimination (RE):** The C-C bond is formed between the aryl and acetylide groups, regenerating the Pd(0) catalyst.\n\nThe team measures the initial reaction rate constant, $k_Z$, for each substituent Z and for the unsubstituted case where Z is hydrogen ($k_H$). They construct a Hammett plot by graphing $\\log(k_Z / k_H)$ versus the Hammett substituent constant, $\\sigma_p$, for each group Z.\n\nTheir data does not yield a single straight line. Instead, the plot clearly shows two distinct linear regions:\n-   For aryl bromides with electron-donating substituents Z (e.g., -OCH₃, -CH₃), the plot is linear with a slope (reaction constant) of $\\rho_1 = +2.1$.\n-   For aryl bromides with electron-withdrawing substituents Z (e.g., -CF₃, -NO₂), the plot is also linear but with a significantly smaller slope of $\\rho_2 = +0.5$.\n\nBased on this experimental evidence, which of the following statements provides the most chemically sound explanation for the observed \"broken\" Hammett plot?\n\nA. Oxidative addition is the rate-determining step (RDS) for electron-donating groups, while transmetalation becomes the RDS for electron-withdrawing groups.\n\nB. Reductive elimination is the RDS for electron-donating groups, while oxidative addition becomes the RDS for electron-withdrawing groups.\n\nC. Transmetalation is the RDS for electron-donating groups, while oxidative addition becomes the RDS for electron-withdrawing groups.\n\nD. Oxidative addition is the RDS across all substituents, but its transition state structure changes significantly, leading to two different $\\rho$ values.\n\nE. Reductive elimination is the RDS for electron-donating groups, while transmetalation becomes the RDS for electron-withdrawing groups.", "solution": "Define the Hammett relation for a given elementary step as\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{k_{Z}}{k_{H}}\\right)=\\rho\\,\\sigma_{p}.\n$$\nFor a fixed mechanism and rate-determining step (RDS), the sign of $\\rho$ indicates how substituents affect the rate: $\\rho>0$ means electron-withdrawing substituents (larger $\\sigma_{p}$) increase the rate of the RDS, while $\\rho<0$ means electron-donating substituents increase that rate. The magnitude $|\\rho|$ measures the sensitivity of the RDS to substituent electronics.\n\nThe observed data show two distinct positive slopes, $\\rho_{1}=+2.1$ (for the set of electron-donating substituents with negative $\\sigma_{p}$) and $\\rho_{2}=+0.5$ (for electron-withdrawing substituents with positive $\\sigma_{p}$). Since both slopes are positive, in both regimes electron-withdrawing groups accelerate the overall rate; the difference in magnitudes indicates that the electronic sensitivity of the overall rate changes between the two regimes. A straightforward interpretation is that the identity of the RDS changes with substituent class.\n\nAmong the Sonogashira steps:\n- Oxidative addition of aryl bromides to $\\text{Pd}(0)$ is typically accelerated by electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryl ring because these substituents increase polarization of the C–Br bond and stabilize the oxidative-addition transition state. Consequently, when oxidative addition is rate-limiting, one expects $\\rho>0$ with relatively large magnitude.\n- Transmetalation between a $\\text{Pd}(II)$ aryl species and a copper acetylide is generally much less sensitive to aryl substituent electronics; if it becomes rate-limiting, a smaller $|\\rho|$ is expected, and the sign can remain positive if electron-withdrawing aryl groups render the $\\text{Pd}(II)$ center more electrophilic, slightly facilitating transmetalation.\n- Reductive elimination to form the aryl–alkynyl bond often shows different and typically smaller or opposite substituent effects relative to oxidative addition; it is not expected to present a strong positive $\\rho$ that is larger in the electron-donating regime and smaller in the electron-withdrawing regime.\n\nTherefore, the most chemically consistent explanation is:\n- For electron-donating substituents (negative $\\sigma_{p}$), oxidative addition is slow and rate-determining, giving a strong positive $\\rho$ (here, $\\rho_{1}=+2.1$).\n- For electron-withdrawing substituents (positive $\\sigma_{p}$), oxidative addition becomes fast; the RDS shifts to transmetalation, which is less sensitive to aryl substituent electronics, yielding a smaller positive slope (here, $\\rho_{2}=+0.5$).\n\nThis pattern aligns with a change in RDS from oxidative addition to transmetalation as the aryl bromide becomes more electron-deficient, matching option A. Options B, C, and E predict either the wrong RDS assignment versus substituent class or the wrong trend in $\\rho$ magnitude and sign. Option D (same RDS but different transition-state structure) would generally not be expected to produce two positive slopes with such a marked difference in magnitude that align with the known electronic sensitivities of oxidative addition and transmetalation; moreover, a mechanistic switch within oxidative addition across substituent classes would more plausibly alter the sign or produce curvature rather than two clean linear regimes with magnitudes consistent with a change of RDS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2212971"}]}
