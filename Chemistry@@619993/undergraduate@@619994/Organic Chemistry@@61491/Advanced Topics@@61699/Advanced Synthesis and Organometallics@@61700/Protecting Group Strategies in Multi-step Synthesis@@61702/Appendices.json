Key principles: \n- Primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes under anhydrous, mild conditions with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC); aqueous chromic acid (e.g., $\\text{Na}_2\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7/\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4/\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) overoxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.\n- Chemoselectivity between two identical functional groups generally requires temporary protection of one group.\n- Silyl ethers (e.g., TBDMS) protect alcohols; they are installed with a non-nucleophilic base and removed with a fluoride source. Aldehydes are not protected by TBDMSCl.\n- Grignard reagents are incompatible with free alcohols and add to carbonyls to form alcohols, not aldehydes.\n\nEvaluate each route:\n\nA. 1. PCC (1.0 equivalent); 2. $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. Although PCC stops at the aldehyde for a primary alcohol, here both ends are equally reactive. Using 1.0 equivalent does not enforce selective mono-oxidation at the molecular level; it statistically distributes oxidation across molecules, giving a mixture of unreacted diol and mono-oxidized product, and potentially some over-oxidation if more oxidant is present locally during the reaction. This is not efficient or high-yielding for the selective transformation.\n\nB. 1. $\\text{Na}_2\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4$, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$; 2. $\\text{LiAlH}_4$. Jones conditions oxidize each primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, producing the diacid (succinic acid). Subsequent $\\text{LiAlH}_4$ reduces carboxylic acids back to primary alcohols, regenerating the diol. This does not produce the aldehyde; it is a detour back to starting material.\n\nC. 1. TBDMSCl, non-nucleophilic base; 2. PCC; 3. Fluoride source. First, selectively protect one alcohol as a TBDMS ether under controlled stoichiometry to obtain a monoprotected diol. Then oxidize the remaining free primary alcohol with PCC to the aldehyde. Finally, remove the TBDMS group with a fluoride source (e.g., TBAF) to regenerate the free alcohol, yielding 4-hydroxybutanal. This strategy is standard for high-yield, chemoselective oxidation when two identical alcohols are present.\n\nD. 1. PCC; 2. TBDMSCl, non-nucleophilic base. Oxidation first risks forming the dialdehyde (with excess PCC) or an inseparable mixture; moreover, TBDMSCl protects alcohols, not aldehydes, so it cannot secure the newly formed aldehyde, and it does not address the need to leave the other alcohol unoxidized. Not an effective route.\n\nE. 1. $\\text{SOCl}_2$; 2. $\\text{Mg}$, ether; 3. $\\text{CH}_2\\text{O}$, then $\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$. Converting one alcohol to a chloride, then to a Grignard reagent, is incompatible with the remaining free alcohol (which would quench the Grignard). Reaction with formaldehyde followed by workup gives a longer-chain alcohol, not an aldehyde. This does not achieve the target.\n\nConclusion: The protection–oxidation–deprotection sequence in option C is the most efficient and high-yielding route to 4-hydroxybutanal from 1,4-butanediol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2192351"}, {"introduction": "A successful multi-step synthesis is like a well-choreographed dance where every step is planned in harmony.

Therefore, the nitro-to-amine transformation is feasible under these conditions and does not represent a lack of reducing power.\n\nAssess the selectivity issue with Pd/C hydrogenation:\n- A fundamental property of Pd/C hydrogenation is hydrogenolysis of benzylic $C\\text{--}O$ bonds. Benzyl ethers ($\\text{Ar}\\text{--}\\text{CH}_2\\text{--}O\\text{--}R$ or $R\\text{--}O\\text{--}\\text{CH}_2\\text{--}\\text{Ph}$) are classic protecting groups that are cleaved under $\\text{H}_2$/Pd/C conditions.

Under $\\text{H}_2$/Pd/C, the hydrogenolysis reaction selectively cleaves at the benzylic carbon–oxygen bond to give the free hydroxymethyl group (–$\\text{CH}_2$–OH) on the aromatic ring, concomitant with formation of toluene from the benzyl moiety. Thus, the intended benzyl protection is lost during the hydrogenation.\n- Consequently, the proposed step will not selectively produce 2-amino-4-(benzyloxymethyl)phenol; instead, it will tend to give the amine with concomitant deprotection of the benzyloxymethyl to a hydroxymethyl substituent, explaining why the desired product is not the major component.\n\nPropose a chemically sound alternative that preserves the benzyl protecting group while reducing the nitro group:\n- A standard, chemoselective method to reduce aromatic nitro groups to anilines in the presence of benzyl ethers is the use of $\\text{SnCl}_2$ in concentrated $\\text{HCl}$, which reduces the nitro group to the anilinium salt without effecting hydrogenolysis. A subsequent basic workup liberates the free aniline.\n- This approach avoids the use of molecular hydrogen and palladium, thereby preventing cleavage of the benzyl ether.\n\nEvaluate the provided options:\n- A is incorrect because Pd/C hydrogenation is sufficiently powerful to reduce aromatic nitro groups; LAH is unnecessary and introduces additional chemoselectivity risks.\n- B is correct: Pd/C will hydrogenolyze benzyl ethers; $\\text{SnCl}_2$/$\\text{HCl}$ with basic workup is an established alternative that preserves benzyl protecting groups while reducing nitro groups.\n- C is incorrect: phenolic OH does not generally poison Pd/C to the point of preventing nitro reduction under these conditions, and protecting the phenol as a silyl ether is unnecessary for this purpose.\n- D is incorrect: under mild $\\text{H}_2$/Pd/C conditions at room temperature, aromatic ring hydrogenation is not competitive; the principal side reaction is benzyl ether hydrogenolysis.\n- E is incorrect: benzyl ethers do not rearrange to diphenylmethane derivatives under $\\text{H}_2$/Pd/C; $\\text{NaBH}_4$ with $\\text{NiCl}_2$ is not a standard, selective protocol for this transformation in the presence of benzyl ethers.\n\nTherefore, the flaw and the correct alternative are identified by option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2192367"}, {"introduction": "Protecting groups are not merely defensive shields; they are powerful tools that can enable otherwise impossible transformations.

The strategy involves protecting the functional groups of glycine, performing a C-alkylation at the alpha-carbon, and finally deprotecting to yield the target molecule. You are asked to identify a key intermediate in this synthetic pathway.\n\nThe synthesis begins with glycine.\n1. First, glycine is reacted with phthalic anhydride under heating to protect the amine functionality.\n2. The product from the first step is then esterified by reacting it with benzyl alcohol in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid.\n3. The resulting doubly-protected glycine derivative is then treated with one equivalent of Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), a very strong and sterically hindered base, in an appropriate solvent at low temperature.\n4.

The amine of glycine attacks one of the anhydride carbonyls, and intramolecular cyclization/elimination furnishes the imide. This converts the free amine into a phthalimide (Gabriel-type protection), yielding the N-phthaloyl derivative commonly referred to as phthalimidoacetic acid. In IUPAC terms, this is 2-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)acetic acid.\n\nStep 2: Protection of the carboxyl group as a benzyl ester. Acid-catalyzed esterification with benzyl alcohol converts the carboxylic acid into the benzyl ester, giving benzyl 2-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)acetate. This is a doubly protected glycine equivalent: the nitrogen is protected as a phthalimide and the carboxyl is protected as a benzyl ester.\n\nStep 3: Generation of the alpha-carbanion with LDA. Lithium diisopropylamide (one equivalent, strong, non-nucleophilic base) deprotonates the methylene alpha to the ester carbonyl and adjacent to the electron-withdrawing phthalimide substituent. This forms the corresponding alpha-carbanion/enolate centered at the carbon between the phthalimide nitrogen and the ester carbonyl. Under these conditions, C-alkylation is favored over O-alkylation.\n\nStep 4: Alkylation with 4-bromobut-1-ene. The primary bromide $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CH}\\text{--}\\text{CH}_2\\text{--}\\text{CH}_2\\text{--}\\text{Br}$ undergoes an S$_{N}$2 reaction with the alpha-carbanion, installing a but-3-enyl fragment at the alpha-carbon. The benzyl ester remains intact, and the phthalimide protection is unchanged. The product is thus the benzyl ester of a six-carbon acid where the alpha-carbon (C2) bears the 1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl substituent, and the side chain from C2 is a three-carbon spacer terminating in a terminal alkene, giving a hex-5-ene skeleton.\n\nIUPAC naming of the product: view the molecule as the benzyl ester of hex-5-enoic acid with a 1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl substituent at C2. Therefore, the correct name is Benzyl 2-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)hex-5-enoate.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.
