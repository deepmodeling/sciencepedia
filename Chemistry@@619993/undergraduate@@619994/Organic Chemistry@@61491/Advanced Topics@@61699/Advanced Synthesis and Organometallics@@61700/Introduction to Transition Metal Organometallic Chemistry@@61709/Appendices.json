The catalyst chosen for this transformation is a well-known organometallic complex with the chemical formula $\\text{RhCl(PPh}_3)_3$, often called Wilkinson's catalyst. To understand the reaction mechanism, the chemist must first characterize the electronic state of the metal center in the starting catalyst. The complex as a whole is electrically neutral. For the purpose of assigning the oxidation state to the metal, the chloro ligand (Cl) is treated as an anion with a formal charge of -1. The triphenylphosphine ligand (PPhâ‚ƒ) is a neutral donor ligand with a formal charge of 0. Based on this information, determine the oxidation state of the central rhodium (Rh) atom in the catalyst.", "solution": "Assign oxidation states using the rule that the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral complex equals the overall charge on the complex.\n\nLet the oxidation state of rhodium be $x$. The chloro ligand is an anion with charge $-1$, and each triphenylphosphine ligand is neutral with charge $0$. There are three triphenylphosphine ligands. The overall charge of the complex is $0$. Therefore,\n$$\nx+(-1)+3(0)=0.\n$$\nSolving,\n$$\nx-1=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x=+1.\n$$\nThus, the oxidation state of rhodium in $\\text{RhCl(PPh}_3)_3$ is $+1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{+1}$$", "id": "2180524"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the formal oxidation state, a more powerful tool for understanding the stability and reactivity of organometallic compounds is the valence electron count. Many stable complexes follow the 18-electron rule, an analogue to the octet rule for main-group elements, but equally important are the systematic exceptions, such as the preference for 16 electrons in square planar $d^8$ metal complexes.
