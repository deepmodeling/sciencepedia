This is an oxidative insertion producing an organomagnesium species in which the carbon bonded to magnesium is nucleophilic (carbanion-like), i.e., the bond is polarized as $C^{\\delta -}\\text{-}Mg^{\\delta +}$.\n$$\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br} + Mg \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{MgBr}$$\nHere, $\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{MgBr}$ is $n$-propylmagnesium bromide, and the carbon bearing Mg is the terminal (C1) carbon.\n\nStep 2 (quench with $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$): Grignard reagents are strong bases and nucleophiles; when treated with heavy water, they undergo deuterolysis (acid-base reaction) to replace the $C{-}MgBr$ bond with a $C{-}D$ bond, transferring a deuteron from $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ to the carbanion center.\n$$\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{MgBr} + \\text{D}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{D} + MgBr(OD)$$\nThus, the organic product is deuterated at the carbon that originally bore Mg, namely the terminal carbon (C1), giving 1-deuteropropane.\n\nExcess $\\text{D}_2\\text{O}$ ensures complete quenching and prevents side reactions. No rearrangement occurs because the Grignard reagent is primary and there is no competing pathway to an alcohol under these conditions.
