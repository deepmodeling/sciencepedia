In an experiment, 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene is treated with 1-octene in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a phosphine ligand, and a tertiary amine base.

The key steps and selectivities are as follows.\n\nFirst, chemoselectivity of oxidative addition: in 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene, the carbon–bromine bond undergoes oxidative addition to palladium in the zero oxidation state far more readily than the carbon–fluorine bond, because the aryl–fluorine bond is significantly stronger and resistant to oxidative addition under standard Heck conditions. Therefore, the catalytic cycle begins with oxidative addition at carbon–bromine, generating a 2-fluorophenyl–palladium(II)–bromide complex; the aryl fragment that persists in the product is thus 2-fluorophenyl and the bromine is lost.\n\nSecond, alkene coordination and migratory insertion: 1-octene coordinates to the palladium center and undergoes migratory insertion into the aryl–palladium bond. For terminal, electronically unbiased alkenes such as 1-octene, the dominant pathway gives the so-called linear product, in which the aryl group becomes bonded to the terminal carbon of the alkene and palladium ends up on the internal carbon of the newly formed alkyl–palladium intermediate. This regioselectivity arises from a combination of steric and electronic factors under standard phosphine-ligated conditions.\n\nThird, beta-hydride elimination: the alkyl–palladium intermediate bears a suitable beta hydrogen and undergoes syn beta-hydride elimination to form the substituted alkene and a palladium–hydride species. Because migratory insertion and beta-hydride elimination proceed with syn stereochemistry but occur sequentially on opposite faces, the net result is formation of the trans-alkene, i.e., the E stereoisomer, as the major product for arylations of terminal alkenes.\n\nFourth, base turnover: the tertiary amine base captures the hydrogen halide formed (here, hydrogen bromide), facilitating reductive elimination to regenerate palladium in the zero oxidation state and close the catalytic cycle.\n\nPutting these together, coupling occurs at the aryl bromide site to give a 2-fluorophenyl-substituted 1-alkene with E geometry, specifically (E)-1-(2-fluorophenyl)oct-1-ene. Evaluating the options:\n- A is inconsistent because bromine would have been the leaving group and should not remain on the aryl ring.\n- B corresponds to the branched regioisomer, which is not the major product under standard conditions.\n- C matches the expected chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and E stereoselectivity.\n- D is the Z isomer, not favored in the Heck reaction under these conditions.\n- E and F are not Heck coupling products from these reactants.\n\nTherefore, the single major product is (E)-1-(2-fluorophenyl)oct-1-ene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2210934"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the fundamental rules of regioselectivity, this problem [@problem_id:2210950] delves into a more nuanced aspect of the Heck reaction mechanism that often arises with cyclic alkenes.

For cycloalkenes, the neutral Heck pathway typically delivers an allylic arylation product in which the aryl group is located at the position allylic to the double bond, not vinylic on the double-bond carbon.\n- In a five-membered ring, this process preferentially yields the 3-substituted cyclopent-1-ene (aryl at $C_3$ with the double bond at $C_1-C_2$), rather than a vinylic 1-arylcyclopent-1-ene or a 4-substituted isomer. The 3-arylcyclopent-1-ene arises because chain walking in cyclopentene typically stops at the allylic position that provides a stable internal double bond and minimizes ring strain and unfavorable 1,3-interactions.\n\nEliminating the other options:\n- 1-Phenylcyclopent-1-ene (vinylic arylation, option B) is not the major product under neutral phosphine-ligated Heck conditions.\n- Phenylcyclopentane (option C) would require net hydrogenation, which does not occur in the Heck manifold.\n- (Cyclopentylidenemethyl)benzene (option D) corresponds to an exocyclic alkene attached to benzene and is not formed in this standard aryl–alkene coupling.\n- 4-Phenylcyclopent-1-ene (option E) is not the favored isomer for the five-membered ring; the allylic 3-substituted isomer predominates.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 3-Phenylcyclopent-1-ene.\n\nHence, the correct IUPAC name is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2210950"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a synthetic method lies not just in its reliability, but also in its tunability. This advanced problem [@problem_id:2210971] explores how a chemist can manipulate reaction conditions to completely reverse the regiochemical outcome of a Heck reaction.

In the neutral pathway, the reaction proceeds via migratory insertion where the aryl group adds to the more electron-rich $\\beta$-carbon of the vinyl ether. In the cationic pathway, the $[\\text{Ph-Pd-L}]^+$ complex activates the coordinated vinyl ether towards nucleophilic attack by the phenyl group, which adds to the $\\alpha$-carbon as it can better stabilize the developing positive charge in the transition state via resonance from the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\nB. The reversal is primarily governed by sterics. In the neutral pathway, the bulky iodide ligand on the palladium(II) intermediate, $L_2\\text{Pd(Ph)I}$, forces the phenyl group to add to the less sterically hindered $\\beta$-carbon. In the cationic pathway, the absence of the iodide ligand reduces steric congestion, allowing the phenyl group to access the more hindered $\\alpha$-carbon.\n\nC. In both pathways, the rate-determining step is $\\beta$-hydride elimination. For the neutral complex, elimination to form the conjugated $\\beta$-product is kinetically fast. For the cationic complex, the positive charge accelerates the elimination from the $\\alpha$-arylated intermediate, making the formation of the terminal alkene product more favorable.\n\nD. The halide scavenger, $\\text{AgBF}_4$, promotes a single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism. This generates a phenyl radical that preferentially attacks the $\\alpha$-carbon of the vinyl ether, as the resulting radical intermediate is stabilized by the adjacent ethoxy group. The neutral pathway proceeds via a standard, non-radical, concerted mechanism.\n\nE. In the cationic pathway, the $[\\text{Ph-Pd-L}]^+$ species acts as a powerful Lewis acid, protonating the vinyl ether at the $\\beta$-position to form a stable secondary carbocation at the $\\alpha$-position. This carbocation is then trapped by the palladium-bound phenyl group acting as a nucleophile. The neutral pathway does not involve such carbocationic intermediates.", "solution": "The Heck reaction proceeds by a Pd-catalyzed two-electron pathway in which regioselectivity is established at the migratory insertion step of an arylpalladium species into a coordinated alkene. The general sequence is oxidative addition, alkene coordination, migratory insertion, and then $\\beta$-hydride elimination.\n\nUnder neutral conditions (with halide present), oxidative addition of iodobenzene to $\\text{Pd}^0 L_n$ gives a neutral arylpalladium(II) halide:\n$$\n\\text{Pd}^0 L_n + \\text{PhI} \\to L_n\\text{Pd}^{\\text{II}}(\\text{Ph})(\\text{I}) .\n$$\nCoordination of the vinyl ether, $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{CHOEt}$, to $L_n\\text{Pd}^{\\text{II}}(\\text{Ph})(\\text{I})$ is followed by migratory insertion. Vinyl ethers are polarized enol ethers; resonance donation from oxygen places greater electron density at the $\\beta$-carbon and stabilizes positive charge at the $\\alpha$-carbon. For the neutral, less electrophilic arylpalladium iodide, migratory insertion proceeds in a way that places the aryl group at the $\\beta$-carbon (the observed $\\beta$-arylation), while Pd ends up at the $\\alpha$-carbon. Subsequent $\\beta$-hydride elimination furnishes predominantly the $\\beta$-arylation product. Thus, in neutral pathways, migratory insertion into the coordinated enol ether is governed by the polar effects of the alkene and the lower electrophilicity of the neutral Pd(II) center, leading to $\\beta$-arylation.\n\nAddition of a stoichiometric halide scavenger, such as $\\text{AgBF}_4$, removes iodide to generate a cationic arylpalladium species:\n$$\nL_n\\text{Pd}^{\\text{II}}(\\text{Ph})(\\text{I}) + \\text{AgBF}_4 \\to [L_n\\text{Pd}^{\\text{II}}(\\text{Ph})]^{+}\\text{BF}_4^{-} + \\text{AgI} .\n$$\nThe cationic complex $[\\text{Ph-Pd-L}]^{+}$ is significantly more electrophilic and forms a stronger $\\pi$-complex with the vinyl ether. In the migratory insertion transition state of this cationic pathway, there is substantial carbocationic character at the $\\alpha$-carbon of the enol ether, which is stabilized by resonance with the adjacent oxygen (oxocarbenium-like character). To maximize this stabilization, the aryl group migrates to the $\\alpha$-carbon, giving the $\\alpha$-arylation product after $\\beta$-hydride elimination. Hence, the switch from a neutral Pd(II) halide to a cationic Pd(II) species reverses the polarization of the migratory insertion transition state and inverts the regioselectivity from $\\beta$- to $\\alpha$-arylation.\n\nTherefore, the mechanistically sound explanation is that neutral and cationic Pd(II) intermediates differ in electrophilicity and in the polarization of the migratory insertion transition state. In the neutral pathway, the aryl group adds at the $\\beta$-carbon; in the cationic pathway, the carbocation-stabilizing $\\alpha$-carbon is favored for aryl addition due to oxocarbenium-like character. This corresponds to option A. Options B, C, D, and E are inconsistent with established two-electron Heck mechanisms: B overemphasizes sterics rather than electronic polarization; C incorrectly assigns $\\beta$-hydride elimination as rate-determining and as the origin of regioselectivity; D invokes an unlikely SET pathway induced by $\\text{AgBF}_4$; E proposes protonation and a discrete carbocation, which is not a feature of the cationic Heck mechanism with Pd-aryl complexes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2210971"}]}
