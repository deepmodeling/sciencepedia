After an extended period of reflux, the student analyzes the reaction mixture and finds only the unchanged starting material. Which of the following statements provides the correct chemical reason for this experimental outcome?\n\nA. The molecule lacks the required allyl aryl ether functional group, as the allyl substituent is attached to the aromatic ring via a carbon-carbon bond.\n\nB. The reaction is sterically hindered because the methoxy group in the para-position blocks the required [3,3]-sigmatropic shift.\n\nC. The methoxy group is a strong electron-donating group, which deactivates the aromatic ring towards this type of pericyclic reaction.\n\nD. A Claisen rearrangement is not a thermal reaction and requires the addition of a strong Lewis acid catalyst to proceed.\n\nE. The allyl group is not sufficiently substituted; the rearrangement only occurs if the terminal carbon of the allyl double bond bears at least one alkyl group.", "solution": "The Claisen rearrangement is a concerted, thermal, pericyclic $[3,3]$-sigmatropic rearrangement that specifically requires an allyl vinyl or allyl aryl ether functional group. In the aryl case, the requisite substrate has the general form $Ar-O-CH_2-CH=CH_2$ (an allyl aryl ether), which undergoes a suprafacial-suprafacial $[3,3]$-shift through a six-atom, chair-like transition state to give an o-allyl phenol after tautomerization.\n\nKey mechanistic requirement: the reaction proceeds by breaking the O–allyl sigma bond and forming a new C–C bond at the ortho position of the ring. Therefore, the presence of an O–allyl bond is essential for the pericyclic topology and orbital overlap that enable the $[3,3]$-sigmatropic transition state.\n\nIn the given substrate, 1-methoxy-4-(prop-2-en-1-yl)benzene, the substituents are:\n- A methoxy group bound to the ring as $Ar-O-CH_3$ (a methyl aryl ether), not an allyl aryl ether.\n- An allyl group bound to the ring via a carbon–carbon bond, $Ar-CH_2-CH=CH_2$.\n\nBecause there is no Ar–O–allyl linkage, the molecule lacks the functional group necessary for a Claisen rearrangement. Heating in an inert solvent cannot induce the $[3,3]$-sigmatropic shift in this substrate, so the starting material remains unchanged.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n- A is correct: the required allyl aryl ether functionality is absent; the allyl group is attached via a C–C bond rather than through oxygen.\n- B is incorrect: para substitution by methoxy does not sterically block a Claisen rearrangement; moreover, the prerequisite O–allyl bond is missing.\n- C is incorrect: the electron-donating nature of methoxy is irrelevant here; Claisen rearrangements are pericyclic, not electrophilic aromatic substitutions that depend on ring activation/deactivation in this way.\n- D is incorrect: Claisen rearrangements are classic thermal pericyclic reactions and do not require Lewis acid catalysis.\n- E is incorrect: Claisen rearrangements proceed with simple allyl groups; substitution at the terminal alkene carbon is not required.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason is that the substrate lacks the allyl aryl ether functionality required for a Claisen rearrangement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2209347"}, {"introduction": "Having established the necessary structural features, we now turn to predicting the product of a classic Claisen rearrangement.

In the present substrate, allyl 2,6-dimethylphenyl ether, both positions ortho to the ether oxygen (C-2 and C-6) are substituted by methyl groups, so the conventional ortho-Claisen pathway is sterically blocked for direct tautomerization to an ortho-product.\n\nWhen both ortho positions are blocked, the reaction follows the para-Claisen pathway: a concerted $[3,3]$-sigmatropic shift delivers an intermediate with the allyl group at the ortho position. Since this cannot directly tautomerize to a stable phenol, it undergoes a second $[3,3]$-sigmatropic (Cope) rearrangement. This moves the allyl group to the para position, forming a para-cyclohexadienone. This dienone is not the final product; it rapidly undergoes keto-enol tautomerization with concomitant rearomatization to furnish the stable phenol.
