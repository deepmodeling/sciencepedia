In a normal electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction, the principal frontier molecular orbital interaction is between the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile; the anhydride group on maleic anhydride lowers its LUMO, facilitating this interaction.\n\nMaleic anhydride is cis-disubstituted and symmetric, so the only stereochemical issue is endo versus exo approach. According to Alder’s endo rule, when the dienophile bears electron-withdrawing substituents with low-lying $\\pi^{\\ast}$ orbitals, secondary orbital interactions between these $\\pi^{\\ast}$ orbitals and the diene’s developing $\\pi$ system in the endo transition state stabilize that transition state relative to the exo transition state.

Under kinetic conditions, the substituents adopt the endo orientation relative to the norbornene bridge. Therefore, the major product is endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n\nThis excludes the exo isomer (option A) because it is typically the thermodynamic product obtained under higher temperature or longer reaction time. It also excludes the bicyclo[2.2.2] system (option C), which is not formed from cyclopentadiene and a simple two-atom dienophile, and the unrelated structures in options D and E.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the endo-norbornene anhydride adduct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2201687"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, we now scrutinize the product's intrinsic stereochemical nature. The formation of new C-C bonds in the Diels-Alder reaction often generates stereocenters, raising questions of chirality. This problem [@problem_id:2201718] challenges you to analyze the symmetry of the *endo* adduct from the reaction of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride, leading to the important conclusion that even with two stereocenters, the product is an achiral meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.", "problem": "In an organic chemistry laboratory, a student performs a Diels-Alder reaction by mixing freshly distilled cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride. The reaction proceeds readily to yield a single major product, which is isolated as a white crystalline solid. Spectroscopic analysis confirms that the isolated product is the *endo* adduct, as predicted by the Alder endo rule for kinetically controlled [4+2] cycloaddition reactions.\n\nBased on the structure of this major *endo* product, which of the following statements correctly describes its stereochemical properties?\n\nA. The product is chiral and is formed as a single enantiomer.\n\nB. The product is chiral and is formed as a racemic mixture.\n\nC. The product is achiral because it is a meso compound.\n\nD. The product is achiral, but it is not a meso compound.\n\nE. The product exists as a pair of rapidly interconverting diastereomers.", "solution": "The Diels-Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene (a symmetric diene) and maleic anhydride (a symmetric dienophile) proceeds by a concerted, suprafacial on both components, [4+2] cycloaddition. Under kinetic control, the Alder endo rule predicts endo approach of the electron-withdrawing anhydride, giving the endo adduct on the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n\nIn this transformation, two new stereocenters are formed at the adjacent carbons derived from the dienophile alkene (the 2 and 3 positions of the norbornene skeleton). Because the cycloaddition is concerted and suprafacial, the two substituents derived from the maleic anhydride are placed cis to each other and oriented endo (toward the bridge).\n\nMaleic anhydride introduces identical substituents at C-2 and C-3, since the two carboxyl groups are interconnected as an anhydride and are symmetry-equivalent. The resulting endo product possesses an internal mirror plane that bisects the bicyclic framework and the anhydride substituents, interconverting the two stereocenters. Consequently, the configurations at the two stereocenters are opposite (for example, $2R,3S$), and the molecule is superposable on its mirror image due to this plane of symmetry.\n\nTherefore, although the product contains two stereocenters, it is achiral because it is a meso compound. It is not formed as a single enantiomer or as a racemic mixture, and there is no pair of rapidly interconverting diastereomers in this case; rather, a single meso diastereomer is obtained as the major endo product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2201718"}, {"introduction": "This final practice integrates two critical stereochemical principles of the Diels-Alder reaction: the stereospecificity related to the diene's geometry and the stereoselectivity of the endo rule. Starting with a stereodefined (2E,4E)-diene, you must first determine how the diene's geometry translates into the relative stereochemistry of substituents on the newly formed ring [@problem_id:2201719]. You will then combine this with the endo preference to predict the complete stereostructure of the major product, demonstrating a comprehensive command of the reaction's stereochemical outcome.", "problem": "A thermal reaction is conducted between (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene and maleic anhydride. Assuming the reaction proceeds under kinetic control to yield a single major cycloaddition product, identify the correct relative stereochemistry of this product from the options below.\n\nIn the descriptions, the term *syn* means that the specified groups are on the same face of the newly formed six-membered ring, while *anti* means they are on opposite faces. The term *cis* and *trans* refer to the relative positions of the two methyl groups with respect to each other.\n\nA: The product where the two methyl groups are *cis* to each other, and the fused anhydride ring is *anti* to the two methyl groups.\n\nB: The product where the two methyl groups are *cis* to each other, and the fused anhydride ring is *syn* to the two methyl groups.\n\nC: The product where the two methyl groups are *trans* to each other, and the fused anhydride ring is *anti* to the two methyl groups.\n\nD: The product where the two methyl groups are *trans* to each other, and the fused anhydride ring is *syn* to the two methyl groups.\n\nE: The reaction does not proceed to form a cycloaddition product.", "solution": "The reaction between (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene and maleic anhydride is a thermal Diels–Alder cycloaddition, which is a concerted, pericyclic, suprafacial-suprafacial process on both the diene and dienophile. Two key stereochemical principles apply:\n\n1) Stereospecificity of the diene: In a suprafacial addition on the diene, the relative orientation of substituents on the diene is preserved in the product. The reactive conformation is the s-cis conformation about the internal single bond of the diene. For the (2E,4E) diene in the s-cis conformation, analyze each double bond:\n- For the left double bond, E geometry means the outer substituent (the terminal methyl at one end) must lie on the side opposite to the internal C–C connection to the rest of the diene.\n- For the right double bond, E geometry likewise places the other terminal methyl on the side opposite to the internal C–C connection.\nIn the standard s-cis depiction where the internal connection between the two double bonds lies on the same side (the “inside” or concave face), both E constraints force both terminal methyl groups to lie on the opposite face (the “outside” face). Therefore, both methyl groups are on the same face of the diene in the transition state and remain on the same face of the newly formed six-membered ring in the product; hence, the two methyl groups are cis to each other.\n\n2) Endo selectivity under kinetic control (Alder endo rule): Maleic anhydride is an electron-poor dienophile bearing electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. Under kinetic control, the transition state that places the dienophile’s electron-withdrawing substituents oriented toward the diene’s developing π-system (endo orientation) is favored due to secondary orbital interactions. In the s-cis depiction, this endo approach orients the anhydride ring toward the concave face of the diene (the same face as the internal diene connection). From the analysis above, the two methyl groups lie on the opposite (outside) face. Consequently, in the product the fused anhydride ring is on the face opposite to the two methyl groups, i.e., anti to them.\n\nCombining these conclusions, the major kinetic product has the two methyl groups cis to each other, and the fused anhydride ring anti to the two methyl groups. This matches option A. The reaction does proceed (so E is incorrect), and the endo preference rules out the syn relationship to the methyls for this E,E diene (so B is incorrect).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2201719"}]}
