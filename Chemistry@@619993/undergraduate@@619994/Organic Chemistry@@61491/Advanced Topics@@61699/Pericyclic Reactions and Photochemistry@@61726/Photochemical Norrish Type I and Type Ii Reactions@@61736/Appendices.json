The Norrish Type II reaction is a powerful intramolecular process that relies on a ketone's ability to fold into a specific six-membered transition state. This first practice problem [@problem_id:2189701] walks you through the fundamental mechanism for a simple, flexible ketone, from the initial hydrogen abstraction to the formation of the final stable products.", "problem": "In the field of polymer science, understanding the photodegradation of materials is crucial. Ketone functionalities within polymer chains can act as photosensitizers, initiating degradation pathways through well-known photochemical reactions. A model system for studying this process involves the irradiation of simple acyclic ketones with ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\nConsider the specific case of 2-pentanone being irradiated with UV light, causing it to undergo a Norrish Type II reaction. The primary photochemical step is an intramolecular hydrogen abstraction, leading to a 1,4-biradical intermediate. This biradical subsequently undergoes carbon-carbon bond cleavage (fragmentation) to produce an alkene and an enol intermediate. The enol is thermodynamically unstable and rapidly rearranges to form a stable ketone.\n\nWhat is the final, stable ketone product generated from this photodegradation pathway? Provide your answer as the standard International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this molecule.", "solution": "2-Pentanone has the structure CH3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, with the carbonyl carbon designated as position 2. In a Norrish Type II process, the photoexcited ketone (typically the $n \\rightarrow \\pi^*$ triplet) abstracts a hydrogen that is gamma to the carbonyl. For 2-pentanone, the gamma position relative to the carbonyl is the terminal methyl at C5, so an intramolecular gamma-hydrogen abstraction occurs to give a 1,4-biradical in which the oxygen bears an O–H bond and radical centers reside at the carbonyl carbon and the gamma carbon.\n\nFrom this 1,4-biradical, the characteristic Norrish Type II fragmentation proceeds by cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond between the alpha and beta carbons on the side bearing the abstracted gamma hydrogen (here, the C3–C4 bond). This scission is concerted with formation of an alkene between the beta and gamma carbons (C4 and C5), yielding ethene as the alkene fragment, and with reformation of the carbonyl via the enol of the remaining fragment derived from the carbonyl side. The enol formed corresponds to the enol of propanone and rapidly tautomerizes to the thermodynamically favored ketone.\n\nTherefore, the final, stable ketone product of the Norrish Type II photofragmentation of 2-pentanone is propanone (common name: acetone).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{propanone}$$", "id": "2189701"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how flexibility enables the Norrish Type II pathway, let's explore the opposite scenario: a molecule locked in a rigid conformation. The caged structure of 2-adamantanone presents a fascinating puzzle, as it physically prevents the geometric arrangement necessary for intramolecular hydrogen transfer. This exercise [@problem_id:2189728] challenges you to apply your knowledge of reaction mechanisms to a structurally constrained system and predict its photochemical fate.", "problem": "The photochemical reactions of ketones are fundamental processes in organic chemistry. Upon absorption of ultraviolet light, a ketone is promoted to an excited state which can then undergo several characteristic reactions. Two of the most common pathways are the Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II reactions. A Norrish Type I reaction involves the homolytic cleavage of one of the alpha-carbon to carbonyl-carbon bonds, forming a diradical intermediate. A Norrish Type II reaction involves the intramolecular abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the gamma-position by the excited carbonyl oxygen, proceeding through a six-membered cyclic transition state to form a 1,4-diradical.\n\nConsider the molecule 2-adamantanone, a ketone incorporated into the rigid, cage-like, bridged polycyclic framework of adamantane. Based on the mechanistic requirements for each pathway, predict the photochemical reactivity of 2-adamantanone upon irradiation with ultraviolet light.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the expected outcome?\n\nA. It undergoes a Norrish Type II reaction but not a Norrish Type I reaction.\n\nB. It undergoes a Norrish Type I reaction but not a Norrish Type II reaction.\n\nC. It undergoes both Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II reactions.\n\nD. It undergoes neither a Norrish Type I nor a Norrish Type II reaction because its rigid structure renders it photochemically unreactive.\n\nE. It rearranges directly to an unsaturated epoxide without forming a diradical intermediate.", "solution": "A Norrish Type I reaction requires that the excited ketone, typically in the $n, \\pi^*$ state ($S_{1}$ or after intersystem crossing $T_{1}$), undergo homolytic cleavage of one of the $\\alpha$ carbon–carbon bonds adjacent to the carbonyl, generating an acyl radical and an alkyl radical. This process primarily depends on the bond dissociation energy of the $\\alpha$ C–C bond and does not require large-amplitude conformational motion or a specific cyclic transition state.\n\nA Norrish Type II reaction requires the presence of an abstractable $\\gamma$ hydrogen and the ability of the excited carbonyl to reach that hydrogen through a six-membered, 1,5-intramolecular hydrogen abstraction transition state to generate a 1,4-diradical. This pathway demands both appropriate spatial proximity and conformational flexibility to achieve the requisite geometry.\n\nIn 2-adamantanone, the carbonyl is embedded in a rigid, bridged adamantane framework. This rigidity prevents the molecule from adopting the six-membered transition state geometry needed for $\\gamma$-hydrogen abstraction. Moreover, due to the cage topology, suitable $\\gamma$ hydrogens are not geometrically accessible to the excited carbonyl oxygen. Therefore, a Norrish Type II reaction is effectively precluded.\n\nBy contrast, Norrish Type I $\\alpha$-cleavage is feasible in such rigid systems because it only requires homolysis of an $\\alpha$ C–C bond from the excited state; in a polycyclic ketone like 2-adamantanone, this cleavage leads to ring-opening diradicals and subsequent fragmentation or recombination pathways. Thus, Norrish Type I is allowed whereas Norrish Type II is disallowed.\n\nTherefore, 2-adamantanone undergoes a Norrish Type I reaction but not a Norrish Type II reaction upon ultraviolet irradiation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2189728"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice extends the theme of structure's influence to reaction efficiency, beyond just which pathway is possible. Di-tert-butyl ketone serves as a critical case study where a Norrish Type I cleavage can occur, but the subsequent steps are dramatically affected by extreme steric bulk. By analyzing this molecule's behavior [@problem_id:2189730], you will uncover the \"cage effect,\" a key concept explaining why some potentially reactive molecules are surprisingly inert.", "problem": "The photochemical reactions of ketones, initiated by the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, often proceed through pathways known as Norrish Type I and Norrish Type II reactions. A Norrish Type I reaction involves the homolytic cleavage of the bond between the carbonyl carbon and an alpha-carbon (alpha-cleavage), forming a radical pair. A Norrish Type II reaction is an intramolecular process that requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a gamma-carbon, which is abstracted by the excited carbonyl oxygen.\n\nConsider the ketone 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-pentanone, also known as di-tert-butyl ketone. When this compound is subjected to UV irradiation, it is found to be exceptionally resistant to undergoing a net chemical change, with a very low quantum yield for product formation.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for the observed photochemical inertness of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-pentanone?\n\nA. It cannot undergo a Type II reaction due to the absence of gamma-hydrogens, and its Type I cleavage is inefficient because the rapid recombination of the initially formed radical pair outcompetes other reaction pathways.\n\nB. The alpha-cleavage in a Type I reaction is energetically unfavorable because it would produce highly unstable primary radicals.\n\nC. The molecule has gamma-hydrogens, but they are sterically hindered by the bulky tert-butyl groups, preventing the intramolecular hydrogen transfer required for a Type II reaction.\n\nD. The C=O bond in this ketone has an unusually high bond dissociation energy, preventing the initial n → π* electronic transition required for any photochemical reaction.\n\nE. It is unreactive towards Type I cleavage because the resulting acyl radical cannot undergo decarbonylation, and it is unreactive towards a Type II reaction because the alpha-hydrogens are too acidic to be abstracted.", "solution": "We consider the two principal photochemical pathways for aliphatic ketones after absorption of $h\\nu$ into an $n \\rightarrow \\pi^*$ excited state: Norrish Type I (homolysis of a C–C bond $\\alpha$ to the carbonyl) and Norrish Type II (intramolecular abstraction of a $\\gamma$-hydrogen by the excited carbonyl oxygen via a six-membered transition state).\n\nFirst, we analyze the structural requirements for a Norrish Type II reaction. A $\\gamma$-hydrogen is one located three carbon–carbon bonds away from the carbonyl carbon. Label the carbonyl carbon as $C_{0}$, the $\\alpha$-carbon as $C_{1}$, the $\\beta$-carbon as $C_{2}$, and the $\\gamma$-carbon as $C_{3}$. In 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-pentanone (di-tert-butyl ketone), each $\\alpha$-carbon ($C_{1}$) is a tert-carbon bonded to three methyl groups. Thus each branch terminates at $C_{2}$ (methyl), and there is no $C_{3}$. Therefore, there are no $\\gamma$-hydrogens, and a Norrish Type II pathway is structurally disallowed.\n\nNext, we analyze the Norrish Type I pathway. The general Type I step is\n$$\nR^{1}COR^{2} \\xrightarrow{h\\nu} R^{1}\\cdot + \\cdot COR^{2}.\n$$\nFor di-tert-butyl ketone,\n$$\nt\\text{-Bu}C(O)t\\text{-Bu} \\xrightarrow{h\\nu} t\\text{-Bu}\\cdot + \\cdot C(O)t\\text{-Bu}.\n$$\nThe radicals formed are a tert-butyl radical ($t\\text{-Bu}\\cdot$, a tertiary radical) and a tert-butyl acyl radical ($\\cdot C(O)t\\text{-Bu}$). The initially formed radicals are geminate and reside within a solvent cage. Within this cage, the principal competing processes and their rate constants are:\n- Geminate recombination to regenerate the ketone: rate $k_{\\text{rec}}$.\n- Decarbonylation of the acyl radical: $\\cdot C(O)t\\text{-Bu} \\rightarrow t\\text{-Bu}\\cdot + CO$, rate $k_{\\text{dec}}$.\n- Cage escape to form free radicals: rate $k_{\\text{esc}}$.\n\nThe branching probabilities within the cage are given by the standard competition formula. For example, the probability of recombination is\n$$\nP_{\\text{rec}}=\\frac{k_{\\text{rec}}}{k_{\\text{rec}}+k_{\\text{dec}}+k_{\\text{esc}}}.\n$$\nThe fraction leading to product formation through nonrecombination channels (e.g., decarbonylation followed by radical combination/disproportionation, or cage escape followed by bimolecular reactions) is\n$$\nP_{\\text{prod}}=\\frac{k_{\\text{dec}}+k_{\\text{esc}}}{k_{\\text{rec}}+k_{\\text{dec}}+k_{\\text{esc}}}.\n$$\nFor di-tert-butyl ketone, the steric bulk of the tert-butyl groups enhances the cage effect and facilitates very rapid geminate recombination of the initially formed radical pair to re-form the ketone. Consequently,\n$$\nk_{\\text{rec}} \\gg k_{\\text{dec}},\\;k_{\\text{esc}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P_{\\text{prod}} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{dec}}+k_{\\text{esc}}}{k_{\\text{rec}}} \\ll 1,\n$$\nwhich directly accounts for the very low quantum yield for net chemical change.\n\nWe now evaluate the options in light of this analysis:\n- A: Correct and complete. There are no $\\gamma$-hydrogens, so Type II is impossible. In Type I, the initially formed geminate radical pair undergoes rapid recombination that outcompetes decarbonylation and escape, yielding a very low net product quantum yield.\n- B: Incorrect. The radicals formed by $\\alpha$-cleavage here are tertiary (not primary), so the premise of energetic disfavour due to primary radical formation is false.\n- C: Incorrect. The molecule does not have $\\gamma$-hydrogens at all; the issue is absence, not steric hindrance of existing $\\gamma$-hydrogens.\n- D: Incorrect. The $n \\rightarrow \\pi^*$ transition is an electronic excitation governed by orbital energies and selection rules, not by the C=O bond dissociation energy; ketones generally absorb UV light in this band.\n- E: Incorrect. Acyl radicals commonly undergo decarbonylation; there is no special inhibition here. Moreover, Type II concerns $\\gamma$-hydrogens, not $\\alpha$-hydrogens, and their acidity is irrelevant to the photochemical hydrogen abstraction step.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2189730"}]}
