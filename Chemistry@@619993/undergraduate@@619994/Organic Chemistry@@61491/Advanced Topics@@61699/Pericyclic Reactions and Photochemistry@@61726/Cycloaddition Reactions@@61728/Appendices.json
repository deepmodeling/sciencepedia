Reactivity order: A < B < C. This is because electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile lower the energy of its Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), decreasing the energy gap between the diene's Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the dienophile's LUMO.\n\nB. Reactivity order: C < B < A. This is because electron-donating groups increase the reactivity of the dienophile by raising the energy of its LUMO, which enhances the orbital overlap with the diene's HOMO.\n\nC.

Reactivity order: C < A < B. This is because the reaction rate is primarily determined by steric hindrance; bulkier dienophiles react more slowly.\n\nE. Reactivity order: A < C < B. This is because the stability of the transition state is maximized when there is a moderate degree of electronic perturbation, making the mono-substituted dienophile the most reactive after the unsubstituted one.", "solution": "For a normal-electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction, the dominant interaction is between the diene’s HOMO and the dienophile’s LUMO. The interaction energy is stabilized by second-order perturbation theory as\n$$\nE_{\\text{stabilization}} \\propto -\\frac{|V|^{2}}{\\Delta E},\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the HOMO–LUMO coupling and the energy gap is\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\text{LUMO}}^{\\text{dienophile}} - E_{\\text{HOMO}}^{\\text{diene}}.\n$$\nA smaller $\\Delta E$ increases the magnitude of stabilization and thus increases the reaction rate. Electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile lower $E_{\\text{LUMO}}^{\\text{dienophile}}$, which decreases $\\Delta E$ and therefore increases reactivity.\n\nApplying this to the given dienophiles:\n- Dienophile A (ethene, $CH_2=CH_2$) has no electron-withdrawing groups, so its LUMO is relatively high in energy, giving a large $\\Delta E$ and the lowest reactivity.\n- Dienophile B (acrylonitrile, $CH_2=CHCN$) has one $CN$ group, a strong electron-withdrawing substituent, which lowers the LUMO relative to ethene, decreasing $\\Delta E$ and increasing reactivity compared to A.\n- Dienophile C (tetracyanoethylene, $C_2(CN)_4$) has four $CN$ groups, which strongly lower the LUMO, giving the smallest $\\Delta E$ and the highest reactivity.\n\nThus, the reactivity order is A < B < C, and the correct justification is that electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile lower its LUMO, decreasing the HOMO(diene)–LUMO(dienophile) gap.

In Diels-Alder reactions, stereoselectivity is often governed by the 'endo rule,' which arises from stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state.

The stereochemical outcome is determined by the relative orientation of the dienophile substituents with respect to the forming bicyclic bridge, giving rise to endo and exo adducts.\n\nAccording to Alder’s endo rule, when the dienophile bears electron-withdrawing groups with low-lying vacant orbitals (as in maleic anhydride), secondary orbital interactions between the diene’s highest occupied molecular orbital and the dienophile’s substituent orbitals stabilize the endo transition state. This stabilization is a kinetic effect; therefore, under kinetic control the endo adduct forms preferentially.\n\nFuran Diels–Alder reactions are often reversible due to the relative instability of the cycloadduct, and under thermodynamic control, the exo adduct can become favored because it is typically less sterically congested. However, the problem explicitly states that the reaction conditions favor the kinetically controlled product, so the major product must be the endo adduct.\n\nRegiochemistry is not an issue here because maleic anhydride is symmetric, and the bicyclic framework resulting from furan as the diene is the 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton bearing the anhydride at the positions corresponding to the dienophile carbons. The endo designation places the anhydride group oriented toward the developing bicyclic bridge.\n\nTherefore, the major stereoisomer under kinetic control is the endo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, which corresponds to option B. The exo adduct (option A) corresponds to the thermodynamic preference, option C is not the standard [4+2] adduct of this pair, option D is not formed in this transformation, and option E contradicts kinetic endo selectivity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2165952"}, {"introduction": "Cycloaddition reactions are fundamentally controlled by the conservation of orbital symmetry, a principle elegantly captured by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.

Two distinct cycloadducts can be envisioned: Product A, 3-cyclohexenecarboxaldehyde, which results from a [4+2] cycloaddition, and Product B, 2-formyl-3-vinylcyclobutane, which results from a [2+2] cycloaddition involving the alkene moiety of acrolein. The chemist's goal is to devise a strategy to selectively synthesize Product A under one set of conditions and Product B under another.\n\nBased on the principles governing pericyclic reactions, which of the following statements correctly identifies the optimal reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical) for forming each product and the fundamental reason for this selectivity?\n\nA. Thermal conditions will favor the [4+2] product (A) because the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile is symmetry-allowed. Photochemical conditions will favor the [2+2] product (B) because photoexcitation promotes an electron, changing the symmetry of the relevant frontier orbital and allowing the otherwise forbidden cycloaddition.\nB. Thermal conditions will favor the [2+2] product (B) because this pathway involves fewer electrons and is therefore kinetically faster. Photochemical conditions will favor the [4+2] product (A) because the added energy of the photons is required to overcome the higher activation energy of the six-membered ring formation.\nC. Thermal conditions will favor the [4+2] product (A) because it is thermodynamically more stable due to reduced ring strain. Photochemical conditions favor the less stable [2+2] product (B) simply because the high energy of the photons enables reactions that are otherwise impossible, regardless of orbital symmetry.\nD.

A concerted $[i+j]$ cycloaddition proceeds thermally in a symmetry-allowed manner if the topology of orbital overlap is compatible with the electron count:\n- For $4n+2$ $\\pi$ electrons (with integer $n$), a suprafacial–suprafacial pathway is thermally allowed.\n- For $4n$ $\\pi$ electrons, a suprafacial–suprafacial pathway is thermally forbidden; only a suprafacial–antarafacial pathway is allowed, which is geometrically inaccessible for simple alkenes.\n\nConsider Product A, the $[4+2]$ cycloaddition (Diels–Alder) of 1,3-butadiene with the alkene of acrolein. This involves $6$ $\\pi$ electrons, so it is a $4n+2$ system with $n=1$. Therefore, under thermal conditions, the suprafacial–suprafacial $[4+2]$ cycloaddition is symmetry-allowed. In frontier molecular orbital terms, the dominant interaction is between the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile; these have matching symmetry phases at the bonding termini, enabling constructive overlap and a low-barrier, concerted reaction to form Product A.\n\nConsider Product B, the $[2+2]$ cycloaddition between two alkenes (one double bond of butadiene and the alkene of acrolein). This involves $4$ $\\pi$ electrons, i.e., a $4n$ system with $n=1$. Under thermal conditions, a concerted suprafacial–suprafacial $[2+2]$ cycloaddition is symmetry-forbidden. Although a suprafacial–antarafacial path would be symmetry-allowed, it is not geometrically feasible for simple alkenes, so Product B is not formed via a concerted thermal pathway.\n\nUnder photochemical conditions, photoexcitation promotes an electron from $\\pi$ to $\\pi^{\\ast}$ in one alkene, changing the occupancy and effective symmetry of the frontier orbital. This inversion of orbital symmetry makes a suprafacial–suprafacial $[2+2]$ cycloaddition symmetry-allowed for a $4n$ system under photochemical control. Consequently, the $[2+2]$ pathway becomes accessible, enabling selective formation of Product B.\n\nTherefore, thermal conditions favor the $[4+2]$ product (A) due to symmetry-allowed HOMO(diene)–LUMO(dienophile) overlap, while photochemical conditions favor the $[2+2]$ product (B) because photoexcitation alters the frontier orbital symmetry to allow the otherwise forbidden cycloaddition.
