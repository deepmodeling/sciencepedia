This first practice problem [@problem_id:1376436] serves as a fundamental entry point, asking you to predict the stereochemical outcome for the thermal cyclization of a polyene with $4n$ $\\pi$-electrons. Mastering this foundational case is the first step toward understanding and predicting the behavior of a wide range of pericyclic reactions.", "problem": "An electrocyclic reaction is a pericyclic reaction in which a new sigma ($\\sigma$) bond is formed between the termini of a linear, conjugated $\\pi$-system, leading to the formation of a cyclic compound. The stereochemistry of this ring closure is determined by the relative rotation of the terminal p-orbitals. If both termini rotate in the same direction (e.g., both clockwise), the process is termed **conrotatory**. If they rotate in opposite directions (e.g., one clockwise, one counter-clockwise), the process is called **disrotatory**.\n\nConsider a generic open-chain, conjugated polyene containing $4n$ $\\pi$-electrons, where $n$ is a positive integer. When this polyene undergoes a thermally induced electrocyclic ring closure, what is the stereochemically preferred pathway according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules?\n\nA. The reaction proceeds via a conrotatory motion.\n\nB. The reaction proceeds via a disrotatory motion.\n\nC. The reaction is symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions and only proceeds photochemically.\n\nD. The stereochemical outcome switches between conrotatory and disrotatory depending on the specific value of $n$.\n\nE. The stereochemical outcome cannot be predicted without knowing the specific substituents on the polyene termini.", "solution": "We consider a linear, conjugated polyene with $N=4n$ $p$ orbitals and $4n$ $\\pi$ electrons undergoing a thermal electrocyclic ring closure. By the Woodward-Hoffmann conservation of orbital symmetry, the stereochemical course of electrocyclic reactions is determined by the symmetry of the ground-state frontier molecular orbital (the HOMO) along the reaction coordinate.\n\nUsing the standard Hückel description for a linear polyene, the molecular orbitals are\n$$\n\\psi_{k}=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_{j}^{(k)} \\phi_{j}, \\quad c_{j}^{(k)} \\propto \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{j k \\pi}{N+1}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $k=1,\\dots,N$ indexes the MOs from lowest to highest energy and $j$ indexes the atomic $p$ orbitals at the termini and along the chain. The relative phase at the termini for MO $k$ is given by the ratio\n$$\n\\frac{c_{N}^{(k)}}{c_{1}^{(k)}}=\\frac{\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{N k \\pi}{N+1}\\right)}{\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{N+1}\\right)}=\\frac{\\sin\\!\\left(k\\pi-\\frac{k\\pi}{N+1}\\right)}{\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{N+1}\\right)}=-\\cos(k\\pi).\n$$\nFor $N=4n$ electrons filling up to the HOMO, the HOMO index is $k=2n$ (all orbitals are doubly occupied up to $k=2n$). Thus\n$$\n\\cos(k\\pi)=\\cos(2n\\pi)=1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{c_{N}^{(2n)}}{c_{1}^{(2n)}}=-1,\n$$\nwhich shows that the terminal lobes of the HOMO are out of phase.\n\nBond formation at the termini in a thermal electrocyclic closure must conserve orbital symmetry: the new $\\sigma$ bond must arise from constructive overlap of the terminal lobes of the ground-state HOMO along the reaction coordinate. Because the HOMO termini are out of phase for a $4n$ system, a disrotatory motion would maintain an out-of-phase overlap at the forming bond, correlating with an antibonding interaction and rendering the pathway symmetry-forbidden. In contrast, a conrotatory motion rotates both terminal $p$ orbitals in the same sense, effecting the phase alignment required for constructive overlap at the forming $\\sigma$ bond and correlating the ground-state HOMO of the reactant with a bonding orbital in the product. Therefore, under thermal conditions, the symmetry-allowed pathway for a $4n$ $\\pi$-electron electrocyclic ring closure is conrotatory.\n\nEvaluating the options, the correct statement is that the reaction proceeds via a conrotatory motion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1376436"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principles of thermal reactions, we now explore how light can dramatically alter the course of an electrocyclization.

Invoke the Woodward-Hoffmann orbital symmetry conservation rules for electrocyclic reactions: These rules relate the allowed stereochemical mode of terminal orbital rotation (conrotatory vs. disrotatory) to the electron count and whether the reaction proceeds thermally or photochemically.\n3. State the general selection rules: \n   - Thermal conditions: $4n$ $\\pi$-electrons favor conrotatory closure; $(4n+2)$ $\\pi$-electrons favor disrotatory closure.\n   - Photochemical conditions: The selection rules invert relative to thermal reactions because excitation promotes an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO, changing the symmetry of the frontier orbital that governs bonding at the termini; thus, $4n$ $\\pi$-electrons favor disrotatory closure and $(4n+2)$ $\\pi$-electrons favor conrotatory closure.\n4.
