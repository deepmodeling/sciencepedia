Chemists use experimental tools like the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) to probe these mechanisms. This exercise [@problem_id:2178430] demonstrates how replacing hydrogen with its heavier isotope, deuterium, can slow down a reaction, providing direct evidence that the $C_{\\beta}-H$ bond is broken in the rate-determining step of the E2 pathway.", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the E2 elimination reaction of 2-bromopropane (CH$_3$CH(Br)CH$_3$) using sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) as the base in an ethanol solvent. The reaction produces propene. The chemist prepares a special isotopically-labeled version of the starting material, 2-bromo-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeuteropropane (CD$_3$CH(Br)CD$_3$), where all six hydrogens on the methyl groups have been replaced by their isotope, deuterium (D).\n\nBoth reactions are run under identical conditions. Let the rate constant for the elimination of standard 2-bromopropane be denoted as $k_H$, and the rate constant for the elimination of its deuterated analog be denoted as $k_D$.\n\nFor this specific type of reaction, breaking a carbon-hydrogen ($C_{\\beta}-H$) bond in the rate-determining step is known to be significantly faster than breaking the corresponding carbon-deuterium ($C_{\\beta}-D$) bond. This phenomenon is known as the primary Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE). Assume that the value of the primary KIE for the cleavage of a single $C_{\\beta}-H$ versus a single $C_{\\beta}-D$ bond in this reaction is 7.0.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the overall reaction rates, $k_H / k_D$. Report your answer as a number rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the overall reaction rates, $k_H / k_D$, for the E2 elimination of 2-bromopropane versus its hexadeuterated analog.\n\nFirst, let's identify the mechanism of the reaction. The reaction of a secondary alkyl halide (2-bromopropane) with a strong, non-bulky base (sodium ethoxide) favors the E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\nThe rate law for an E2 reaction is second-order overall:\n$$\n\\text{rate} = k[\\text{alkyl halide}][\\text{base}]\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant. We are asked to find the ratio of the rate constants, $k_H / k_D$.\n\nThe E2 mechanism is a concerted, one-step process. For 2-bromopropane, the ethoxide ion (EtO$^-$) acts as a base, abstracting a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbon bearing the bromine atom (a $\\beta$-hydrogen). Simultaneously, the C-H bond breaks, a $\\pi$ bond forms between the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ carbons, and the C-Br bond breaks, expelling the bromide ion as the leaving group.\n\nBecause the entire process occurs in a single step, this concerted step is the rate-determining step (RDS) of the reaction. Crucially, the cleavage of the $C_{\\beta}-H$ bond is an integral part of this RDS.\n\nThe Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE) is the effect on the reaction rate observed when an atom in the reactant is replaced by one of its isotopes. A primary KIE is observed when the bond to the isotopically substituted atom is broken or formed in the RDS.\n\nIn this problem, the standard reactant is 2-bromopropane, which has six equivalent $\\beta$-hydrogens on the two methyl groups. The deuterated reactant, 2-bromo-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexadeuteropropane, has six equivalent $\\beta$-deuteriums instead.\n\nThe C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond due to its lower zero-point vibrational energy. Consequently, more energy is required to break a C-D bond than a C-H bond. Since the cleavage of this bond occurs in the RDS of the E2 reaction, the reaction involving the deuterated substrate will be slower than the reaction involving the standard substrate.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the primary KIE for the cleavage of a single $C_{\\beta}-H$ versus a single $C_{\\beta}-D$ bond is 7.0. By definition, the KIE is the ratio of the rate constant for the reaction with the lighter isotope ($k_H$) to the rate constant for the reaction with the heavier isotope ($k_D$).\n$$\n\\text{KIE} = \\frac{k_H}{k_D}\n$$\nThe value of the KIE directly reflects the difference in reaction rates caused by isotopic substitution at the position where a bond is broken in the rate-determining step. The fact that there are six equivalent $\\beta$-hydrogens (or $\\beta$-deuteriums) is a statistical factor that affects the probability of a successful collision at any one of these sites. However, this statistical factor is the same for both the hydrogen-containing and deuterium-containing molecules and cancels out when taking the ratio of the rates. The fundamental chemical event being compared is the cleavage of a C-H bond versus a C-D bond.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the overall reaction rates, $k_H / k_D$, is simply equal to the given primary kinetic isotope effect.\n$$\n\\frac{k_H}{k_D} = \\text{KIE} = 7.0\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The given KIE is 7.0, which already has two significant figures.

In its most stable chair, the trans-1,4 substituents can be diequatorial, but E2 requires an axial leaving group. Ring flip gives the diaxial conformer, in which both halogens are axial and each is antiperiplanar to an axial hydrogen on an adjacent carbon, allowing E2 from either site.\n\nBetween the two possible eliminations, the leaving group ability controls the rate under identical antiperiplanar geometries. Bromide is a better leaving group than chloride, so E2 occurs preferentially by loss of $\\text{Br}^{-}$ from C1 with abstraction of an axial $\\text{H}$ from C2 or C6 by $\\text{NH}_{2}^{-}$, forming the double bond adjacent to C1. The chloride at C4 remains unchanged. The product is the cyclohexene bearing chlorine at C4, i.e., 4-chlorocyclohexene.\n\nOnly one molar equivalent of base is present and the reaction is at low temperature, disfavoring sequential eliminations; thus conjugated diene or aromatized products are not formed under these conditions.
