They are meso compounds.", "solution": "The substrate is optically pure (R)-3-iodo-3-methylhexane, which has a stereogenic center at C3. Under hydrolysis in water proceeding exclusively via an $\\text{S}_\\text{N}1$ mechanism, the reaction occurs in two key steps:\n\n1) Ionization: The C–I bond heterolytically cleaves to form a tertiary carbocation at C3 and iodide. The tertiary carbocation is stabilized by the three alkyl substituents (methyl, ethyl, propyl), and crucially, this carbocation has a trigonal planar geometry at C3, rendering the reactive center achiral during this intermediate stage.\n\n2) Nucleophilic attack: Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks the planar carbocation from either face with comparable probability. Attack from one face leads to inversion relative to the original configuration and attack from the opposite face leads to retention relative to the original orientation. After deprotonation, both pathways yield 3-methylhexan-3-ol with opposite configurations at C3 (one R and one S).\n\nSince the product has a single stereogenic center and the two major products differ only by inversion at that single center, they are non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, the two major isomeric alcohol products are enantiomers.\n\nThey are not constitutional isomers because the connectivity is unchanged (only the configuration at the stereocenter differs). They are not diastereomers, which would require at least two stereocenters or stereochemical difference not as mirror images. They are not identical because they have opposite configurations. They cannot be meso because a meso compound requires at least two stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry, which is not the case here.\n\nThus, the correct stereochemical relationship is enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2202482"}, {"introduction": "While racemization is the textbook outcome for an $\\text{S}_\\text{N}1$ reaction at a single stereocenter, many molecules possess additional, non-reacting stereocenters. This practice [@problem_id:2202457] challenges you to analyze how such a \"spectator\" stereocenter influences the final product mixture.

In an $\\text{S}_\\text{N}1$ reaction in water, the mechanism proceeds by:\n1) Heterolytic cleavage of the C2–Br bond to form a tertiary carbocation at C2. This carbocation is planar and $sp^2$-hybridized, allowing nucleophilic attack from either face.\n2) Water attacks the planar carbocation at C2 from both faces with comparable probability, yielding after deprotonation two alcohols that differ only in the configuration at C2. The stereochemistry at C4 remains unchanged because C4 is not involved in the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the two major alcohol products are the pair (2R,4S)-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylhexane and (2S,4S)-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylhexane. These two products have the same connectivity and the same configuration at C4 but opposite configuration at C2. By definition, compounds that differ at one (but not all) stereocenters are diastereomers, not enantiomers. They are not identical, not constitutional isomers, and cannot be a meso compound because the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry and the stereocenters are not symmetrically equivalent.\n\nHence, the stereochemical relationship between the two major alcohol products is that they are diastereomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2202457"}, {"introduction": "True mastery in organic chemistry comes from integrating multiple concepts to solve a single problem.

You will explore how a nucleophile capable of attacking from different atoms generates a mixture of constitutional isomers, each of which is formed as a pair of enantiomers, showcasing a rich interplay of regiochemistry and stereochemistry.", "problem": "An optically pure sample of (R)-3-chloro-3-methylhexane is treated with an excess of sodium nitrite ($\\text{NaNO}_2$) in a suitable polar, protic solvent, leading to a Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular ($\\text{S}_\\text{N}1$) reaction.

In an $\\text{S}_\\text{N}1$ reaction under polar protic conditions, the mechanism proceeds by:\n1) Ionization of the tertiary chloride to form a planar, trigonal $sp^2$ carbocation at C3. This rate-determining step eliminates the original stereochemistry at C3.\n2) Nucleophilic capture of the planar carbocation from either face, leading to racemization at C3 for any product formed.\n\nThe nucleophile $\\text{NO}_2^-$ is ambident and can attack the electrophilic center through nitrogen or through oxygen. Therefore, two distinct linkage (constitutional) isomers are formed:\n- N-attack gives the nitro compound, 3-methyl-3-nitrohexane, where C3 is bonded to $\\text{NO}_2$ via nitrogen.\n- O-attack gives the alkyl nitrite, 3-methylhexan-3-yl nitrite, where C3 is bonded to the nucleophile via oxygen to form an $R-O-N=O$ functionality. Due to resonance equivalence of the two oxygen atoms in $\\text{NO}_2^-$ prior to capture, only one alkyl nitrite constitutional isomer results from O-attack.\n\nIn each constitutional pathway, the planar carbocation intermediate is attacked from either face with comparable probability, giving a racemic mixture at C3. Thus:\n- The nitro pathway yields a pair of enantiomers, $(R)$- and $(S)$-3-methyl-3-nitrohexane.\n- The nitrite pathway yields a pair of enantiomers, $(R)$- and $(S)$-3-methylhexan-3-yl nitrite.\n\nAltogether, four substitution products are formed: two pairs of enantiomers. Any product from the nitro pair is a constitutional isomer (not a stereoisomer) of any product from the nitrite pair. Therefore, the statement that most accurately and completely describes the product mixture is that the reaction yields two pairs of enantiomers, with products in different pairs being constitutional isomers of each other.\n\nEliminations:\n- A is incorrect because there are two constitutional isomers and each appears as a racemic pair; the mixture is not a single achiral compound.\n- B is incomplete because it ignores the O-alkylation (alkyl nitrite) pathway.\n- C is incorrect because within each constitutional set the two stereoisomers are enantiomers, not diastereomers; across sets they are constitutional isomers.\n- E is incorrect because $\\text{S}_\\text{N}1$ is not stereospecific and does not give complete inversion.\n\nTherefore, D is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2202473"}]}
