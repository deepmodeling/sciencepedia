In the context of the E1 mechanism, this often involves determining all possible alkene isomers that can form. This exercise challenges you to reverse that process: by understanding the principles of regioselectivity and molecular symmetry, you must identify a starting material that, by its very structure, limits the elimination pathway to a single constitutional isomer. This practice hones your ability to connect substrate structure directly to product outcome, a fundamental aspect of synthetic strategy.

The subsequent removal of a beta-proton by a weak base leads to the formation of an alkene. If multiple, non-equivalent beta-protons are available for abstraction, a mixture of constitutional isomers of alkenes can be formed.\n\nConsider the following tertiary alkyl bromides. Which one, when subjected to solvolysis by heating in ethanol, will yield a single, unique constitutional isomer of an alkene as the exclusive elimination product?\n\nA. 2-bromo-2-methylpropane\nB. 2-bromo-2-methylbutane\nC. 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane\nD. 3-bromo-3-methylpentane\nE. 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane", "solution": "The reaction proceeds by the E1 mechanism: ionization to a carbocation, followed by deprotonation at a beta position to form an alkene. A single, unique constitutional isomer as the exclusive elimination product requires that all available beta-hydrogen sites be equivalent or that only one set of beta-hydrogens exists, so that elimination can lead to only one alkene constitutional isomer.\n\nAnalyze each substrate with respect to the carbocation formed and the set of non-equivalent beta positions:\n\nA. 2-bromo-2-methylpropane forms the tert-butyl carbocation, in which all three beta positions are the three identical methyl groups. Deprotonation at any beta site gives the same alkene, 2-methylpropene. Therefore, only one constitutional alkene is possible.\n\nB. 2-bromo-2-methylbutane forms a tertiary carbocation with two non-equivalent beta sites (the terminal methyl at C1 and the methylene at C3). Deprotonation at C1 gives 2-methyl-1-butene, and at C3 gives 2-methyl-2-butene, i.e., a mixture of constitutional isomers.\n\nC. 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane forms a tertiary cyclohexyl carbocation. Beta-hydrogens exist on the ring carbons adjacent to the cation (C2/C6, equivalent by symmetry) and on the methyl substituent. Elimination at C2/C6 gives 1-methylcyclohexene (internal double bond), while elimination at the methyl gives methylene cyclohexane (exocyclic double bond). These are distinct constitutional isomers, so a mixture results.\n\nD. 3-bromo-3-methylpentane forms a tertiary carbocation. The only beta-protons are on the methylene groups at C2 and C4, which are equivalent by symmetry. Deprotonation yields a single constitutional isomer, 3-methyl-2-pentene. However, this alkene exists as a mixture of E and Z stereoisomers. By contrast, option A yields a single product with no possible stereoisomers, making it the superior answer for a question asking for a single, unique product.\n\nE. 2-bromo-2,3-dimethylbutane forms a tertiary carbocation with two non-equivalent beta positions: the protons on the C1 methyl groups and the single proton on the C3 methine. Elimination at these different sites leads to different alkenes (2,3-dimethyl-1-butene and 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene), so a mixture forms.\n\nOnly option A has all beta-hydrogens equivalent and yields a single alkene constitutional isomer that also has no stereoisomers, making it the only unambiguous answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2210170"}, {"introduction": "Reactions rarely occur in isolation. The E1 pathway is in constant competition with other mechanisms, particularly SN1 and E2. Understanding which pathway will dominate is a critical predictive skill that depends heavily on the reaction conditions. This problem provides a classic scenario comparing a reaction run with a weak base (solvolysis) against one run with a strong base, illustrating how a simple change in reagent can completely shift the reaction from a unimolecular (E1/SN1) to a bimolecular (E2) mechanism.

Two separate experiments are conducted.\n\nIn **Experiment A**, the student dissolves 2-chloro-2-methylpropane in pure, anhydrous ethanol and heats the solution. The reaction proceeds slowly, and analysis of the product mixture reveals the formation of 2-methylpropene as the major elimination product, but also a substantial amount of 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane.\n\nIn **Experiment B**, the student dissolves 2-chloro-2-methylpropane in anhydrous ethanol and then adds a stoichiometric equivalent of sodium ethoxide ($CH_3CH_2ONa$). This reaction proceeds much more rapidly than Experiment A, yielding 2-methylpropene as the overwhelming major product, with only trace amounts of 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane observed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate mechanistic explanation for the difference in reaction rates and product distributions observed between Experiment A and Experiment B?\n\nA. The reaction in Experiment A proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, while the reaction in Experiment B proceeds via an E2 mechanism. The steric bulk of the ethoxide ion in Experiment B prevents it from acting as a nucleophile.\nB. In Experiment A, ethanol acts as a strong base, promoting a rapid E1 reaction. In Experiment B, the ethoxide ion is a weaker base than ethanol, which slows down the reaction but favors elimination.\nC. Both experiments proceed through a stable tertiary carbocation intermediate. The reaction is faster in Experiment B because the higher concentration of negative charge from the ethoxide ion better stabilizes this carbocation.\nD. In Experiment A, the reaction proceeds slowly via competing E1 and SN1 pathways that share a common carbocation intermediate, as ethanol is a weak base and nucleophile. In Experiment B, the strong ethoxide base promotes a rapid, concerted E2 reaction that outpaces the other pathways.\nE. The primary difference is the solvent polarity. The addition of ionic sodium ethoxide in Experiment B drastically increases the solvent's polarity, which selectively accelerates the E2 transition state compared to the E1 transition state.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the correct mechanistic explanation for the different outcomes of the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane under two different conditions: (A) with ethanol alone, and (B) with sodium ethoxide in ethanol.\n\n**Analysis of the Substrate and Reagents**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the starting material. 2-chloro-2-methylpropane is a tertiary alkyl halide. Due to significant steric hindrance around the alpha-carbon, it cannot undergo an SN2 reaction. It is, however, an excellent substrate for reactions that involve a carbocation intermediate (SN1, E1) because it can form a stable tertiary carbocation. It can also undergo an E2 reaction if a sufficiently strong base is present.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment A**\n\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Pure ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$).\n*   **Properties:** Ethanol is a polar protic solvent. It is a weak nucleophile and a very weak base.\n*   **Mechanism:** When a tertiary alkyl halide is placed in a solution with only a weak nucleophile/weak base, the reaction must proceed through a unimolecular pathway. The rate-determining step is the spontaneous dissociation of the leaving group (chloride ion) to form a stable tertiary carbocation, $(CH_3)_3C^{+}$.\n    $$(CH_3)_3C-Cl \\xrightarrow{\\text{slow}} (CH_3)_3C^{+} + Cl^{-}$$\n*   **Product Formation:** This carbocation intermediate is planar and highly reactive. It can be attacked by the solvent in two ways:\n    1.  **SN1 Pathway:** The ethanol molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbocation. A subsequent deprotonation step yields the substitution product, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane.\n        $$(CH_3)_3C^{+} + CH_3CH_2OH \\rightarrow (CH_3)_3C-O^{+}(H)CH_2CH_3 \\xrightarrow{-H^{+}} (CH_3)_3C-OCH_2CH_3$$\n    2.  **E1 Pathway:** The ethanol molecule acts as a base, removing a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbocation (a beta-carbon). This forms the elimination product, 2-methylpropene.\n        $$CH_3-C^{+}(CH_3)_2 + CH_3CH_2OH \\rightarrow CH_2=C(CH_3)_2 + CH_3CH_2OH_2^{+}$$\n*   **Conclusion for Experiment A:** The reaction is slow because the rate-determining step (carbocation formation) has a high activation energy. The formation of both substitution (2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane) and elimination (2-methylpropene) products is consistent with competing SN1 and E1 pathways proceeding through a common carbocation intermediate.\n\n**Analysis of Experiment B**\n\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium ethoxide ($CH_3CH_2ONa$) in ethanol. This salt dissociates to provide sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) and a high concentration of ethoxide ions ($CH_3CH_2O^{-}$).\n*   **Properties:** The ethoxide ion is a strong base and a strong nucleophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** In the presence of a strong base, a bimolecular elimination (E2) pathway becomes available and is highly favored for tertiary substrates. In the E2 mechanism, the base removes a beta-proton in a single, concerted step while the leaving group departs. There is no carbocation intermediate. The rate of an E2 reaction is dependent on the concentration of both the substrate and the base: $\\text{Rate} = k[\\text{Substrate}][\\text{Base}]$.\n    $$CH_3CH_2O^{-} + H-CH_2-C(Cl)(CH_3)_2 \\xrightarrow{\\text{fast, concerted}} CH_3CH_2OH + CH_2=C(CH_3)_2 + Cl^{-}$$\n*   **Conclusion for Experiment B:** The E2 pathway has a lower activation energy than the E1 pathway (it doesn't require forming a high-energy carbocation) and is therefore much faster, especially with a high concentration of strong base. This rapid E2 reaction dominates, leading to a high yield of the elimination product, 2-methylpropene. Since the strong base preferentially attacks the more accessible beta-proton rather than the sterically hindered alpha-carbon, elimination is heavily favored over substitution.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **A:** Incorrect. SN2 does not occur on a tertiary substrate. While ethoxide's bulk can disfavor substitution in some cases, its primary role here is as a strong base, and it is not considered particularly bulky compared to bases like tert-butoxide.\n*   **B:** Incorrect. Ethanol is a very weak base, not a strong one. Ethoxide is a much stronger base than ethanol. The premise is flawed.\n*   **C:** Incorrect. The E2 reaction in Experiment B is concerted and does not proceed through a carbocation intermediate. This is a fundamental difference between the E1 and E2 mechanisms.\n*   **D:** Correct. This statement accurately describes the situation. Experiment A involves slow, competing unimolecular (E1/SN1) reactions with a weak base/nucleophile. Experiment B involves a fast, bimolecular (E2) reaction promoted by the strong ethoxide base, which outcompetes the slower unimolecular pathways.\n*   **E:** Incorrect. While adding an ionic salt can affect solvent polarity, this is a secondary effect. The primary reason for the dramatic change in rate and product distribution is the introduction of a strong base, which fundamentally changes the dominant reaction mechanism from unimolecular (E1/SN1) to bimolecular (E2).\n\nTherefore, option D provides the most accurate and complete mechanistic explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2210120"}, {"introduction": "The carbocation intermediate is the heart of the E1 mechanism, and its behavior isn't always straightforward.

The substrate is 2-bromo-3,3-dimethyl-1,1,1-trideuteriobutane with the connectivity CD3 (C1)–CH(Br) (C2)–C(CH3)3 (a tert-butyl group, with C3 as the quaternary carbon).\n\nApply the E1 mechanism. In ethanol under E1-favoring conditions, the first, rate-determining step is unimolecular ionization: loss of bromide from C2 to give a secondary carbocation at C2. This obeys the principle that E1 proceeds via carbocation formation.\n\nConsider carbocation rearrangement. The initially formed secondary carbocation at C2 is adjacent to a quaternary carbon (C3). A 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon C3 to C2 is highly favorable because it transforms the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3. A 1,2-hydride shift is impossible since C3 has no hydrogens. The 1,2-methyl shift moves one of the methyl groups from C3 to C2, and the positive charge moves from C2 to C3. This follows the general principle that carbocations rearrange to achieve greater stability.\n\nEliminate from the tertiary carbocation. After the 1,2-methyl shift, the new carbocation intermediate is `CD3-CH(CH3)-C(+)(CH3)2`. From this tertiary carbocation, a weak base (ethanol) can remove a beta-proton from an adjacent carbon to form an alkene. There are two types of beta-protons:\n- From C2 (which now bears one hydrogen): deprotonation at C2 forms a double bond between C2 and C3. The resulting alkene is tetrasubstituted: `CD3-C(CH3)=C(CH3)2`.\n- From one of the methyl groups attached to C3: deprotonation at a methyl carbon forms a double bond between that carbon and C3. The resulting alkene is trisubstituted: `CD3-CH(CH3)-C(=CH2)(CH3)`.\n\nZaitsev’s rule states that the most stable, most substituted alkene will be the major product. The tetrasubstituted alkene is more stable than the trisubstituted one. Therefore, the tetrasubstituted alkene is the major product.\n\nTrack the isotopic label. The starting material is `CD3-CH(Br)-C(CH3)3`. After ionization, rearrangement, and elimination, the major product is `CD3-C(CH3)=C(CH3)2`. The carbon skeleton is that of 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene. In this product, the `CD3` group is attached to carbon C2, which is one of the sp²-hybridized carbons of the C=C double bond. The deuterium label remains intact.\n\nConclude the identity of the major product. The major alkene is 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene, with the CD3 group attached to an sp² carbon of the double bond. This corresponds to statement A. Statement B describes a rearranged, but less stable (anti-Zaitsev) product. Statement C describes an incorrect carbon skeleton.
