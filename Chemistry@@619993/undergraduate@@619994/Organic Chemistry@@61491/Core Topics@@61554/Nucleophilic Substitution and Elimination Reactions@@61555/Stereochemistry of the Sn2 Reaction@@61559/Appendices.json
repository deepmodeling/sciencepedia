(S), (S)", "solution": "The stereocenter in 2-bromopentane is at C-2, which is bonded to four different groups: bromine, an ethyl group, a methyl group, and hydrogen. By the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) rules, priorities are assigned as follows for the starting material:\n- Compare the atoms directly attached to C-2: Br, C (of ethyl), C (of methyl), H. Using atomic numbers, $\\text{Br}$ has the highest priority, then $\\text{C}$, then $\\text{C}$, then $\\text{H}$.\n- To distinguish ethyl versus methyl, compare the next layer: ethyl is attached to $\\{\\text{C},\\text{H},\\text{H}\\}$ while methyl is attached to $\\{\\text{H},\\text{H},\\text{H}\\}$, so ethyl outranks methyl.\nThus, the initial priority order at C-2 in $(R)$-2-bromopentane is $1=\\text{Br}$, $2=\\text{ethyl}$, $3=\\text{methyl}$, $4=\\text{H}$, and the configuration is given as $(R)$.\n\nFirst experiment (reaction with $NaN_3$): $N_3^-$ is a strong nucleophile and weak base, and under typical substitution-favoring, polar aprotic conditions, a secondary alkyl bromide undergoes an $S_N2$ reaction, which proceeds by a single, concerted backside attack with Walden inversion at the stereocenter. The substitution replaces $\\text{Br}$ with an $\\text{N}_{3}$ group at C-2. In the product 2-azidopentane, by CIP rules the new priorities at C-2 are determined by the atoms directly attached: $\\text{N}$ (from $\\text{N}_{3}$), $\\text{C}$ (ethyl), $\\text{C}$ (methyl), $\\text{H}$. Since $\\text{N}$ has higher atomic number than $\\text{C}$ and $\\text{H}$, and ethyl still outranks methyl as before, the product priority order is $1=\\text{N}_{3}$, $2=\\text{ethyl}$, $3=\\text{methyl}$, $4=\\text{H}$. Because the mechanism is $S_N2$, there is inversion of configuration at C-2. Moreover, the leaving group in the reactant (Br) and the incoming nucleophile in the product ($\\text{N}_{3}$) both occupy the highest priority position relative to the other substituents. Therefore, the Walden inversion converts $(R)$ to $(S)$. The 2-azidopentane is $(S)$.\n\nSecond experiment (reaction with $NaOH$ under substitution-favoring conditions): Under conditions that favor substitution and a single predictable stereochemical outcome, a secondary bromide reacting with a strong nucleophile such as $\\text{OH}^{-}$ proceeds via $S_N2$, again giving backside attack and a single Walden inversion at C-2. The substitution replaces $\\text{Br}$ with $\\text{OH}$. In the product pentan-2-ol, the priorities at C-2 are assigned by the atoms directly attached: $\\text{O}$ (from $\\text{OH}$), $\\text{C}$ (ethyl), $\\text{C}$ (methyl), $\\text{H}$. Since $\\text{O}$ outranks $\\text{C}$ and $\\text{H}$ and ethyl outranks methyl, the product priority order is $1=\\text{OH}$, $2=\\text{ethyl}$, $3=\\text{methyl}$, $4=\\text{H}$. The $S_N2$ mechanism inverts the configuration, and here again the leaving group in the reactant (Br) and the incoming nucleophile in the product ($\\text{OH}$) are both the highest-priority substituents relative to the other three. Consequently, the initial $(R)$ configuration is inverted to $(S)$. The pentan-2-ol is $(S)$.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configurations are $(S)$ for 2-azidopentane and $(S)$ for pentan-2-ol, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2202697"}, {"introduction": "Organic synthesis often involves multiple steps, and controlling stereochemistry throughout the sequence is crucial for producing the desired target molecule. This exercise [@problem_id:2202712] explores this challenge through a two-step transformation, where each step proceeds with inversion of configuration.

The major product of this reaction is 2-acetoxybutane, also known as sec-butyl acetate.\n\nGiven the standard mechanisms for these reactions, determine the stereochemical configuration of the final 2-acetoxybutane product.\n\nA.

For $(R)$-2-butanol, the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) priority order at C2 is: OH (highest, due to O), then ethyl (–CH$_{2}$CH$_{3}$), then methyl (–CH$_{3}$), with H being lowest.\n\nStep 1: Conversion of alcohol to chloride with SOCl$_{2}$ in pyridine.\n- Mechanistic principle: In the presence of pyridine, SOCl$_{2}$ converts the alcohol to the corresponding alkyl chloride via formation of an alkyl chlorosulfite intermediate followed by an $S_N2$ displacement by Cl$^{-}$ with backside attack. This step is stereospecific and proceeds with inversion of configuration at the stereogenic center. The competing $S_{Ni}$ (retention) pathway is characteristic of SOCl$_{2}$ without a base; pyridine suppresses $S_{Ni}$ and promotes $S_N2$.\n- Stereochemical consequence: $(R)$-2-butanol undergoes one inversion to give 2-chlorobutane with the opposite configuration at C2. For 2-chlorobutane, the CIP priorities at C2 are: Cl (highest), then ethyl, then methyl, with H lowest. This ordering is analogous to the alcohol case in that the heteroatom substituent remains highest and the carbon substituents rank ethyl above methyl. Therefore, one $S_N2$ inversion converts $(R)$ to $(S)$, yielding $(S)$-2-chlorobutane.\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic substitution with sodium acetate in DMF.\n- Reaction conditions: DMF is a polar aprotic solvent, which enhances nucleophilicity and favors bimolecular substitutions. Sodium acetate (CH$_{3}$COO$^{-}$) is a nucleophile that will attack secondary alkyl chlorides under these conditions via $S_N2$.\n- Mechanistic principle: The substitution proceeds via a single backside attack at C2 with a concerted transition state, giving inversion of configuration and forming the ester 2-acetoxybutane (sec-butyl acetate).\n- Stereochemical consequence: Starting from $(S)$-2-chlorobutane, one $S_N2$ inversion gives $(R)$-2-acetoxybutane. For 2-acetoxybutane, the CIP priorities at C2 are: OAc (highest, due to O), then ethyl, then methyl, with H lowest, matching the relative ranking pattern used above. Thus, inversion at C2 converts $(S)$ to $(R)$.\n\nOverall stereochemical outcome:\n- Two consecutive $S_N2$ inversions (first with SOCl$_{2}$/pyridine, then with acetate in DMF) give net retention relative to the starting $(R)$-2-butanol, and because the substituent change preserves the CIP priority pattern (heteroatom group highest, ethyl second, methyl third), the absolute configuration of the final product is $(R)$.\n- There is no carbocation formation or $S_N1$ pathway under the stated conditions, so no racemization occurs. The product has a single stereogenic center and cannot be meso.\n\nTherefore, the major (and exclusive, under these stereospecific conditions) product is $(R)$-2-acetoxybutane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2202712"}, {"introduction": "The stereochemical consequences of an $S_N2$ reaction are not merely abstract R/S labels; they are deeply rooted in the three-dimensional shape and conformational preferences of the molecule.

In a 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane, a cis relationship requires one substituent axial and the other equatorial on the same face (both up or both down) in a given chair. Because the tert-butyl group has a very strong preference for an equatorial position due to steric bulk, the most stable chair of cis-1-bromo-4-tert-butylcyclohexane places tert-butyl equatorial and, to maintain cis stereochemistry at 1,4, places bromine axial on the same face.\n\nAssess the feasibility of the $S_N2$ displacement. For secondary cyclohexyl halides, an efficient backside approach in $S_N2$ occurs when the leaving group is axial, which aligns the C–X bond along the appropriate trajectory for nucleophilic attack. In the preferred conformation identified above, bromine is axial, so the necessary stereoelectronic alignment is available and the reaction is not prohibitively slow.\n\nApply the stereochemical outcome of $S_N2$. The $S_N2$ mechanism proceeds with inversion at the reacting center (carbon 1). Starting from an axial substituent at C1 (bromine), inversion installs the incoming ethynyl group into the equatorial position on the opposite face. Thus, an axial-up bromine is replaced by an equatorial-down ethynyl group. Relative to the tert-butyl group at C4 (which remains equatorial on the original face), the product now has a trans-1,4 relationship between ethynyl and tert-butyl.\n\nDetermine the most stable chair conformation of the product. In a trans-1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane, a diequatorial arrangement is possible. Given the dominant equatorial preference of tert-butyl and the availability of an equatorial site for the ethynyl group, the lowest-energy conformation of the product is the trans isomer with both tert-butyl and ethynyl equatorial.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is: trans-1-ethynyl-4-tert-butylcyclohexane with the tert-butyl group equatorial and the ethynyl group equatorial.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2202764"}]}
