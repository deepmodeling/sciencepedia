In an $E2$ reaction, dehydrohalogenation can occur from either of the two $\\beta$ positions: removal of a $\\beta$-hydrogen at C1 gives 1-butene (Hofmann product, less substituted), while removal at C3 gives 2-butene (Zaitsev product, more substituted). According to Zaitsev’s rule, small, unhindered strong bases preferentially give the more substituted alkene (2-butene), whereas bulky bases favor the less substituted alkene (1-butene) due to steric hindrance in the transition state for $\\beta$-deprotonation.\n\nEvaluate each base:\n- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH): It is a small, strong base. With a secondary substrate under elimination-favoring conditions (e.g., heat, alcoholic solvent), NaOH promotes $E2$ and follows Zaitsev selectivity, making 2-butene the major alkene relative to 1-butene.\n- Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu): It is a bulky base, which typically favors Hofmann elimination, increasing the proportion of 1-butene and decreasing the relative yield of 2-butene.\n- Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA): It is a very strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. Its steric bulk also biases toward Hofmann elimination, favoring 1-butene over 2-butene under $E2$ conditions.\n\nTherefore, among the provided choices, NaOH best maximizes the desired 2-butene relative to isomeric byproducts.

Abstraction of a hydrogen from the internal beta carbon yields 2-hexene (Zaitsev), whereas abstraction from the terminal beta carbon yields 1-hexene (Hofmann). To maximize 1-hexene, a bulky, strong, non-nucleophilic base is required to preferentially remove the less hindered terminal beta hydrogen.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- Sodium methoxide, $CH_3O^-Na^+$ (A), and sodium ethoxide, $C_2H_5O^-Na^+$ (B), are small, strong bases that favor Zaitsev elimination to 2-hexene; they do not optimize formation of 1-hexene.\n- Potassium tert-butoxide, $(CH_3)_3CO^-K^+$ (C), is a bulky, strong base that disfavors approach to the more substituted beta hydrogen and promotes abstraction at the less hindered site, yielding the Hofmann product 1-hexene.\n- Sodium hydroxide, $OH^-Na^+$ (D), is small and can also promote competing substitution; as a small base, it favors Zaitsev elimination.\n- Pyridine, $C_5H_5N$ (E), is a weak base and is ineffective for $E2$ on a secondary alkyl halide under typical conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most effective choice to favor 1-hexene from 2-bromohexane via $E2$ is the bulky base potassium tert-butoxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2215739"}, {"introduction": "Rules like those of Zaitsev and Hofmann are powerful predictive tools, but they are subject to the fundamental mechanistic requirements of a reaction.

Experimentally, this reaction is observed to yield 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene as the sole alkene product, which represents the less substituted, or \"Hofmann,\" product.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for this specific outcome, where the Zaitsev product is not formed at all?\n\nA. The beta-carbon that would lead to the Zaitsev product is a quaternary carbon and therefore has no hydrogen atoms to be abstracted by the base.\n\nB. The reaction requires a sterically hindered base, which can only access the less sterically hindered protons, leading exclusively to the Hofmann product.\n\nC.
