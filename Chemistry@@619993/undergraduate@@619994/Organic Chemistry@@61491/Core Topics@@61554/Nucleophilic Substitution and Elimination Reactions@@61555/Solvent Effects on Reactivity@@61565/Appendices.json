This is especially true for reactions that involve the formation of charged intermediates. This practice invites you to analyze a reaction that proceeds through a carbocation, predicting how the rate changes when moving from a low-polarity to a high-polarity solvent, reinforcing the critical concept of transition state stabilization [@problem_id:2200077].", "problem": "Consider the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol to 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone. The established mechanism for this reaction indicates that the rate-determining step is the formation of a tertiary carbocation intermediate from a protonated alcohol precursor.\n\nAn experiment is designed to investigate the influence of the solvent on this reaction. Two parallel trials are conducted:\n- **Condition 1:** The reaction is carried out in diethyl ether acting as the solvent, with a catalytic amount of a strong, non-nucleophilic acid added.\n- **Condition 2:** The reaction is carried out using a dilute aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, where the solvent system is primarily water and also serves as the acid catalyst.\n\nAssuming the initial concentrations of the diol and the effective catalytic activity of the acid are identical in both setups, and both reactions are maintained at the same temperature, how would the rate of reaction in Condition 2 compare to the rate of reaction in Condition 1?\n\nA.

The reaction rate will be approximately the same in both conditions.\n\nD. The product composition will be different, but the rates will be unaffected.\n\nE. The reaction will only proceed in Condition 2 because diethyl ether is an aprotic solvent.", "solution": "The problem asks us to predict the effect of changing the solvent from diethyl ether (Condition 1) to aqueous sulfuric acid (Condition 2) on the rate of a reaction whose rate-determining step is the formation of a carbocation.\n\nThe central principle to apply here is the effect of solvent polarity on the stability of reactants, transition states, and intermediates. According to reaction rate theory, the rate of a reaction is inversely related to the activation energy ($E_a$). Any factor that stabilizes the transition state of the rate-determining step more than it stabilizes the reactant will lower the activation energy and increase the reaction rate.\n\nLet's analyze the rate-determining step (RDS) of the reaction. The problem states the RDS is the formation of a carbocation from a protonated alcohol.\nLet R-OH be the starting diol.\nStep 1 (fast equilibrium): $R-OH + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons R-OH_{2}^{+}$ (protonated alcohol, an oxonium ion)\nStep 2 (slow, RDS): $R-OH_2^+$ $\\rightarrow$ $R^+$ (carbocation) + $H_2O$\n\nThe species involved in the RDS are the reactant (the protonated diol, $R-OH_2^+$) and the products of this step (the carbocation, $R^+$, and a water molecule). The transition state for this step, denoted as $[TS]^{\\ddagger}$, will be a structure where the C-O bond is partially broken and a positive charge is developing on the carbon atom. Therefore, the transition state is highly polar and carries a partial positive charge, resembling the carbocation it is about to form.\n\nNow, let's compare the two solvents:\n- **Condition 1: Diethyl ether ($(CH_3CH_2)_2O$)** is a relatively non-polar, aprotic solvent. It has a low dielectric constant. While the oxygen atom's lone pairs can provide some solvation for cations, its ability to stabilize charged species is weak.\n- **Condition 2: Aqueous sulfuric acid ($H_2O/H_2SO_4$)** means the primary solvent is water. Water is a highly polar, protic solvent with a high dielectric constant. It is exceptionally effective at solvating charged species through ion-dipole interactions and, for anions, hydrogen bonding.\n\nLet's compare the stabilization of the species in the RDS in both solvents.\nThe reactant for the RDS is $R-OH_2^+$, which is already a charged species. Both solvents will solvate it.\nThe transition state $[TS]^{\\ddagger}$ has a significant, delocalized positive charge.\nThe intermediate $R^+$ is a fully formed carbocation.\n\nThe key is the *change* in stabilization energy in going from the reactant to the transition state. The highly polar and protic water in Condition 2 is much better at stabilizing the large, charge-dispersed transition state and the resulting carbocation intermediate compared to the non-polar diethyl ether in Condition 1. Because the transition state is more stabilized by the polar solvent than the initial protonated alcohol (which has a more localized charge on the oxygen), the overall activation energy ($E_a$) for the RDS is significantly lowered in water.\n\nSince the reaction rate ($k$) is related to activation energy by the Arrhenius equation, $k = A \\exp(-E_a / RT)$, a lower activation energy ($E_a$) leads to an exponentially higher reaction rate.\n\nTherefore, changing the solvent from the non-polar diethyl ether to the highly polar water will dramatically increase the reaction rate.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\nA. The reaction rate will be significantly faster in Condition 2. This is consistent with our analysis.\nB. The reaction rate will be significantly slower in Condition 2. This is incorrect. Polar solvents stabilize carbocation formation.\nC. The reaction rate will be approximately the same in both conditions. This is incorrect; solvent effects are profound for reactions involving charged intermediates.\nD. The product composition will be different, but the rates will be unaffected. While side reactions might differ, the primary effect is on the rate. The claim of unaffected rates is false.\nE. The reaction will only proceed in Condition 2. This is an overstatement. The reaction would likely be extremely slow in diethyl ether but not impossible. Polar solvents accelerate it, not enable it in an absolute sense.\n\nThe correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2200077"}, {"introduction": "While polar solvents often accelerate reactions involving charged species, this is not a universal rule; the net effect on the rate depends on the solvent's interaction with both the reactant and the transition state. This exercise explores a fascinating decarboxylation that proceeds through a cyclic, less-polar transition state, challenging you to apply a more nuanced analysis of solvation effects [@problem_id:2200071]. By comparing the relative stabilization of the ground state versus the transition state, you will understand why a polar solvent can sometimes slow a reaction down.", "problem": "Consider the thermal decarboxylation of 3-oxobutanoic acid, an example of a beta-keto acid. The reaction mechanism is known to proceed in a single, concerted step through a six-membered cyclic transition state, which involves an intramolecular transfer of a proton from the carboxylic acid group to the ketone's oxygen atom.\n\nA chemist wishes to compare the rate of this reaction in two different solvents: hexane, a nonpolar solvent, and ethanol, a polar protic solvent. Which of the following statements most accurately predicts and explains the observed difference in reaction rates?\n\nA. The rate will decrease in ethanol compared to hexane because the polar solvent stabilizes the polar starting material more effectively than it stabilizes the less polar, cyclic transition state.\n\nB. The rate will increase in ethanol compared to hexane because the polar solvent helps to stabilize the charge separation that occurs during the bond-breaking process in the transition state.\n\nC. The rate will remain essentially unchanged in either solvent because the intramolecular nature of the reaction makes it insensitive to the external solvent environment.\n\nD. The rate will increase in ethanol compared to hexane because the protic solvent can donate a proton to the ketone group, acting as an acid catalyst and lowering the activation energy.\n\nE. The rate will decrease in ethanol compared to hexane because the polar solvent molecules will form a tight solvation shell around the starting material, creating a steric barrier that prevents the formation of the required cyclic transition state.", "solution": "The thermal decarboxylation of a beta-keto acid proceeds by a single, concerted step through a six-membered cyclic transition state in which the carboxylic acid proton is transferred intramolecularly to the ketone oxygen as the C–C bond to the carboxyl group breaks, releasing CO2. The key kinetic quantity is the activation free energy, defined in a given solvent $s$ by\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{s} = G_{\\text{TS},s} - G_{\\text{R},s},\n$$\nwhere $G_{\\text{TS},s}$ and $G_{\\text{R},s}$ are the free energies of the transition state and reactant in solvent $s$.

The cyclic transition state is intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded, with the proton in flight and limited charge separation; its polarity is not markedly greater than that of the already polar starting acid, and the specific solvation that stabilizes the free acid (strong hydrogen bonding to the acid OH and carbonyl groups) is partially disrupted in forming the preorganized, intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded cyclic arrangement. Consequently, ethanol stabilizes the reactant free energy $G_{\\text{R},\\text{ethanol}}$ significantly more than it stabilizes the transition state free energy $G_{\\text{TS},\\text{ethanol}}$, whereas in hexane both are much less solvated:\n$$\n\\left[G_{\\text{TS},\\text{ethanol}} - G_{\\text{R},\\text{ethanol}}\\right] > \\left[G_{\\text{TS},\\text{hexane}} - G_{\\text{R},\\text{hexane}}\\right],\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{ethanol}} > \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{hexane}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad k_{\\text{ethanol}} < k_{\\text{hexane}}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the rate decreases in ethanol relative to hexane because the polar protic solvent stabilizes the polar starting material more than the less polar, cyclic transition state. This directly supports option A.\n\nBy contrast, option B incorrectly assumes significant charge separation in the transition state that would be preferentially stabilized by ethanol; the concerted, intramolecular, hydrogen-bonded cyclic transition state is not strongly ionic. Option C neglects well-established solvent effects on relative stabilization of ground and transition states even for intramolecular processes. Option D posits acid catalysis by ethanol; however, the canonical thermal decarboxylation proceeds without external acid catalysis, and protonation of the ketone oxygen would invoke a different, more ionic pathway not implied under the stated conditions. Option E attributes the rate decrease to a steric solvation shell; while solvation can influence organization, the dominant and more accurate rationale is differential stabilization of the reactant relative to the transition state by a polar protic solvent, as in A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2200071"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond qualitative predictions, physical organic chemists use quantitative models called Linear Free-Energy Relationships (LFERs) to dissect complex solvent effects.
