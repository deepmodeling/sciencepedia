This first practice challenges you to connect the substrate's structure—in this case, a tertiary bromide—to the experimentally observable rate law. Understanding this connection is the first step toward building a predictive model for nucleophilic substitution reactions. [@problem_id:2170045]", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is investigating the kinetics of a substitution reaction. The chosen reaction involves dissolving 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane in a large excess of methanol, which serves as both the nucleophile and the solvent, at a constant temperature. The student's goal is to determine the rate law that governs the formation of the resulting ether product, 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexane.\n\nAfter consulting their textbook, the student proposes two plausible rate laws for the reaction:\n\n**Rate Law I:** rate = $k$[1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane]\n**Rate Law II:** rate = $k$[1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane][methanol]\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the reactants and the principles of substitution reaction mechanisms, which rate law is expected to be experimentally observed, and what is the fundamental reason for this?\n\nA. Rate Law I, because the reaction proceeds through a bimolecular transition state involving both the substrate and the nucleophile.\nB. Rate Law I, because the rate-determining step involves only the dissociation of the substrate.\nC. Rate Law II, because the reaction is a concerted process where the bond to the nucleophile forms as the bond to the leaving group breaks.\nD. Rate Law II, because a stable carbocation intermediate is formed in the first step of the reaction.", "solution": "We begin by classifying the substrate. In 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane, the carbon bearing bromine is bonded to a methyl group and to two carbons of the cyclohexane ring; thus, the electrophilic carbon is tertiary. Tertiary alkyl halides strongly favor an $S_N1$ pathway in polar protic solvents.\n\nConsider the two canonical substitution mechanisms and their corresponding rate laws:\n\n1. $S_N1$ mechanism (unimolecular nucleophilic substitution):\n- Rate-determining step is ionization (dissociation) of the substrate to form a carbocation and a leaving group. For a tertiary halide in methanol (a polar protic solvent), this step is facilitated by carbocation stability and solvation of ions.\n- Elementary steps:\n$$\\text{R-Br} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\text{R}^+ + \\text{Br}^- \\quad \\text{(slow)}$$\n$$\\text{R}^+ + \\text{MeOH} \\to \\text{ether conjugate acid} \\quad \\text{(fast)}$$\n- Rate law determined by the slow step:\n$$\\text{rate} = k_1[\\text{R-Br}]$$\nThus, the rate depends only on the substrate concentration and is independent of the methanol concentration.\n\n2. $S_N2$ mechanism (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution):\n- Single concerted transition state where the C–Nu bond forms as the C–Br bond breaks. The rate law is second order:\n$$\\text{rate} = k_2[\\text{R-Br}][\\text{MeOH}]$$\n- This is disfavored here because the tertiary center is sterically hindered, and methanol is a weak nucleophile in a polar protic solvent.\n\nGiven the substrate is tertiary and the solvent is methanol (polar protic), the reaction proceeds via $S_N1$, so the experimentally observed rate law is first order in the substrate:\n$$\\text{rate} = k[\\text{1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane}]$$\nThe fundamental reason is that the rate-determining step involves only unimolecular dissociation to form a tertiary carbocation; the nucleophile does not participate in the transition state of the slow step. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNote: Although a large excess of methanol could render any methanol-dependent rate pseudo-first-order, the mechanistic and structural analysis shows that the intrinsic rate law is unimolecular ($S_N1$), not bimolecular ($S_N2$), for this substrate-solvent system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2170045"}, {"introduction": "The $S_N2$ reaction is highly sensitive to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms around the reaction center. This exercise moves beyond simple substrate classification of primary, secondary, or tertiary, and into the world of conformational analysis. By comparing two stereoisomers of a substituted cyclohexane, you will discover how a molecule's preferred shape dictates its reactivity in an $S_N2$ reaction. [@problem_id:2170012]", "problem": "Consider the reaction of two stereoisomers, cis-1-bromo-4-methylcyclohexane and trans-1-bromo-4-methylcyclohexane, with sodium iodide in acetone. This reaction proceeds via a Substitution, Nucleophilic, Bimolecular ($S_N2$) mechanism. Based on your understanding of cyclohexane conformations and the stereoelectronic requirements of the $S_N2$ reaction, determine which isomer will react at a significantly faster rate. Select the option that correctly identifies the faster-reacting isomer and provides the correct chemical reasoning.\n\nA. The cis isomer reacts faster because its most stable chair conformation places the bromine atom in an axial position, which allows for unimpeded backside attack by the nucleophile.\nB. The trans isomer reacts faster because its most stable chair conformation places the bromine atom in an equatorial position, which is more sterically accessible.\nC. The cis isomer reacts faster because the bulky methyl group sterically shields the equatorial bromine atom, forcing the reaction to proceed through the more reactive axial conformer.\nD. The trans isomer reacts faster because both substituents are in equatorial positions in its most stable chair conformation, leading to a more stable reactant and a lower activation energy.\nE. Both isomers react at approximately the same rate because the energy difference between their respective chair conformers is negligible.", "solution": "The $S_N2$ mechanism requires a single, concerted backside attack by the nucleophile at the carbon bearing the leaving group. The stereoelectronic requirement is that the nucleophile approaches colinearly with the C–Br bond from the side opposite the leaving group. In cyclohexanes, the accessibility of this backside trajectory depends strongly on whether the leaving group is axial or equatorial: an axial C–Br bond projects along the ring axis, giving a relatively unhindered approach path, whereas an equatorial C–Br bond points roughly outward into the ring periphery, where the backside trajectory is sterically encumbered by the ring framework.\n\nFor 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexanes:\n- The cis-1,4 isomer has one axial and one equatorial substituent in each chair conformation. Between the two possible chairs, the lower-energy conformation places the larger substituent equatorial. Using steric parameters $A_{\\text{sub}}$ (A-values) to quantify the energetic penalty for axial substitution, with $A_{\\text{Me}}$ and $A_{\\text{Br}}$ for methyl and bromine respectively and $A_{\\text{Me}} > A_{\\text{Br}}$, the most stable chair of the cis isomer places the methyl group equatorial and therefore the bromine axial.\n- The trans-1,4 isomer can adopt a diequatorial conformation (both substituents equatorial) or a diaxial conformation (both axial). The diequatorial conformation is strongly favored because it avoids the combined axial penalties $A_{\\text{Me}} + A_{\\text{Br}}$; thus, in the dominant conformer of the trans isomer, the bromine is equatorial.\n\nSince $S_N2$ at a cyclohexyl carbon is much faster when the leaving group is axial, let $k_{\\text{ax}}$ denote the intrinsic $S_N2$ rate constant for an axial C–Br and $k_{\\text{eq}}$ for an equatorial C–Br, with $k_{\\text{ax}} \\gg k_{\\text{eq}}$. The observed rate is proportional to $f_{\\text{ax}}k_{\\text{ax}} + f_{\\text{eq}}k_{\\text{eq}}$, where $f_{\\text{ax}}$ and $f_{\\text{eq}}$ are the conformer populations bearing axial and equatorial bromine, respectively. For the cis isomer, the most populated conformer has bromine axial, so $f_{\\text{ax}}^{\\text{cis}}$ is large. For the trans isomer, the most populated conformer has bromine equatorial (diequatorial overall), so $f_{\\text{ax}}^{\\text{trans}} \\ll 1$. Consequently, the cis isomer undergoes $S_N2$ substantially faster.\n\nThis matches the statement that the cis isomer reacts faster because its most stable chair conformation places the bromine axial, allowing favorable backside attack. Therefore, option A is correct, while options B, C, D, and E misstate either the conformational preferences or the stereoelectronic requirement for the $S_N2$ reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2170012"}, {"introduction": "A defining characteristic of the $S_N1$ pathway is the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is not always static.

The reaction medium is hot ethanol, which is a polar protic solvent and a weak nucleophile/base. Under solvolysis conditions in a polar protic solvent, the operative pathway is $S_N1/E1$ via carbocation formation.\n\nStep 1 (ionization): Loss of bromide from the primary bromide generates the cyclobutylmethyl carbocation. Although primary carbocations are generally unstable, the cyclobutylmethyl cation is a special case that is known to rearrange extremely rapidly.\n\nStep 2 (rearrangement): The cyclobutylmethyl carbocation undergoes a rapid ring expansion rearrangement (cyclobutylcarbinyl to cyclopentyl cation) through a nonclassical/bicyclobutonium intermediate or an equivalent 1,2-shift, yielding the more stable cyclopentyl carbocation. This rearrangement is a hallmark of cyclobutylcarbinyl systems.\n\nStep 3 (nucleophilic capture): Ethanol, present as solvent and nucleophile, attacks the cyclopentyl carbocation to produce the corresponding ethoxylated product. Subsequent deprotonation gives the neutral ether, ethoxycyclopentane. Because ethanol is a weak base, substitution is favored over elimination under solvolysis conditions, even at elevated temperature, so the ether is the major product.\n\nElimination to form cyclopentene is possible via $E1$ from the cyclopentyl cation but is not the major pathway with ethanol as the nucleophile/base. Direct $S_N2$ on the primary bromide would give (ethoxymethyl)cyclobutane, but ethanol is a weak nucleophile and the observed chemistry under solvolysis conditions is dominated by ionization and rearrangement.
