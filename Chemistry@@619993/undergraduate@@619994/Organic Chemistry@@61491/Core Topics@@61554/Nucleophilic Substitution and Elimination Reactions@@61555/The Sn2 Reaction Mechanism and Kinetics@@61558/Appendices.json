This practice explores a classic example of an unreactive substrate, an aryl halide, and challenges you to identify the fundamental mechanistic barrier. Correctly analyzing this scenario is key to defining the geometric and orbital rules that govern the $S_N2$ pathway and avoiding common pitfalls in synthetic planning [@problem_id:2212812].", "problem": "An undergraduate student is studying nucleophilic substitution reactions. They successfully react 1-bromobutane with sodium methoxide in methanol, observing the formation of 1-methoxybutane. Encouraged, the student attempts to synthesize anisole (methoxybenzene) by reacting bromobenzene with sodium methoxide under identical conditions. To their surprise, no reaction is observed. The student hypothesizes that the reaction on bromobenzene is simply very slow but still proceeds through a standard bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) mechanism. This proposed mechanism involves a backside attack of the methoxide ion on the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, leading to a pentacoordinate transition state before the bromide ion is expelled.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental and accurate reason why the student's proposed $S_N2$ mechanism for the reaction on bromobenzene is considered mechanistically invalid?\n\nA. The C-Br bond in bromobenzene is significantly stronger than in 1-bromobutane due to partial double bond character from resonance, which makes the bromide a poor leaving group in this specific context.\n\nB. The backside attack pathway required for an $S_N2$ mechanism is geometrically impossible because the nucleophile's trajectory is blocked by the benzene ring, and the sp2-hybridized carbon cannot undergo the necessary stereochemical inversion.\n\nC. The methoxide ion is too sterically hindered to approach the bromobenzene molecule, a phenomenon that is particularly pronounced in aromatic systems.\n\nD. Bromobenzene is a nonpolar molecule, and the polar protic solvent methanol cannot effectively solvate it to facilitate the substitution reaction.\n\nE. The electron-rich pi system of the benzene ring creates a strong electrostatic repulsion with the incoming electron-rich methoxide nucleophile, preventing it from reaching the electrophilic carbon.", "solution": "An $S_N2$ mechanism has strict geometric and orbital requirements:\n- The nucleophile must approach along the line opposite the C–leaving group bond (backside attack), aligning with the C–X $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital. This approach is 180 degrees from the leaving group and produces a single, concerted transition state with Walden inversion.\n- This inversion is only well-defined for an $sp^3$-hybridized, tetrahedral carbon center capable of passing through a trigonal bipyramidal, pentacoordinate transition state.\n\nApplying these requirements to 1-bromobutane, the reacting carbon is $sp^3$ and the backside trajectory is accessible, so $S_N2$ occurs readily with methoxide.\n\nIn bromobenzene, the carbon bearing bromine is $sp^2$ and part of the aromatic ring. This invalidates $S_N2$ for two fundamental, inseparable reasons:\n- Geometric/orbital alignment: a backside trajectory collinear with the C–Br bond would require approach through the plane of the ring from the “backside,” which is blocked by the aromatic framework. The necessary alignment with the C–Br $\\sigma^{*}$ orbital cannot be achieved because the carbon is embedded in the planar $sp^2$ system.\n- Stereoelectronic constraint: Walden inversion at an $sp^2$ center is not defined; the $sp^2$ carbon cannot adopt the trigonal bipyramidal geometry required for the $S_N2$ transition state.\n\nTherefore, a bimolecular backside displacement on an aryl (or vinylic) carbon is mechanistically disallowed. Other statements (A, C, D, E) discuss contributing or contextual factors, but they do not capture the fundamental mechanistic impossibility. The most accurate and fundamental reason is the geometric and stereoelectronic impossibility of backside attack and inversion at an $sp^2$ aryl carbon, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2212812"}, {"introduction": "This final practice beautifully integrates the two defining features of the $S_N2$ reaction: its second-order kinetics and its characteristic backside attack leading to stereochemical inversion.

At the experimental temperature, the iodide ion ($I^-$) from sodium iodide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the (S)-2-iodooctane in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) reaction, which results in the displacement of the iodide leaving group and inversion of stereochemistry.\n\nThe kinetics of this substitution are first-order with respect to 2-iodooctane and first-order with respect to the iodide ion.
