The key step involves a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) reaction where sodium methoxide ($\\text{NaOCH}_3$) is used as the nucleophile. The chemist has two possible starting materials: 1-bromobutane and 1-tosyloxybutane (butyl p-toluenesulfonate). A good leaving group is one that is stable as an anion, and the stability of this anion is often correlated with the acidity of its conjugate acid. For reference, the approximate $pK_a$ of hydrobromic acid ($\\text{HBr}$) is -9.0, and the $pK_a$ of p-toluenesulfonic acid ($\\text{TsOH}$) is -2.8.\n\nBased on an understanding of leaving group ability in $S_N2$ reactions, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the relative reaction rates and provides the correct underlying chemical principle?\n\nA. 1-bromobutane will react significantly faster because its conjugate acid, $\\text{HBr}$, is a stronger acid than $\\text{TsOH}$ (as indicated by its more negative pKa), which makes the bromide anion a more stable and therefore better leaving group.\n\nB. 1-tosyloxybutane will react significantly faster because the tosylate anion's negative charge is extensively delocalized across its three sulfonyl oxygens and the aromatic ring through resonance, making it an exceptionally stable and excellent leaving group.\n\nC. 1-bromobutane will react significantly faster because the bromide ion is much smaller and less sterically bulky than the tosylate ion, allowing it to depart from the transition state more easily.\n\nD. Both substrates will react at nearly identical rates because both bromide and tosylate are conjugate bases of strong acids (pKa < 0), and are thus considered to be equally effective \"good\" leaving groups.\n\nE. 1-tosyloxybutane will react significantly faster because the carbon-oxygen bond in a sulfonate ester is inherently weaker and more polarized than the carbon-bromine bond in an alkyl bromide.", "solution": "For a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) reaction, the rate law is $v = k[\\text{substrate}][\\text{nucleophile}]$. The leaving group affects the rate constant $k$ by influencing the activation barrier: a better leaving group stabilizes the developing negative charge in the transition state and the anion formed in the products, thereby lowering the activation energy and increasing the rate.\n\nLeaving group ability correlates with the stability of the anion formed, which in turn often correlates with the acidity of its conjugate acid: if $HX$ is more acidic (lower $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$), then $X^{-}$ is a weaker base and typically a better leaving group. Comparing $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ and $\\mathrm{TsO^{-}}$, one finds $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\mathrm{HBr}) < \\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\mathrm{TsOH})$, which indicates that $\\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ is indeed a very weak base and a good leaving group. However, the tosylate anion, $\\mathrm{TsO^{-}}$, benefits from extensive resonance stabilization: its negative charge is delocalized over three sulfonyl oxygens and further into the aromatic ring. This resonance delocalization makes $\\mathrm{TsO^{-}}$ exceptionally stable, often surpassing halides in leaving group ability. Empirically and mechanistically, sulfonate esters (e.g., $\\mathrm{OTs}$) are ranked as superior leaving groups relative to bromide, commonly ordered as $\\mathrm{OTf^{-}} > \\mathrm{OTs^{-}} \\gtrsim \\mathrm{MsO^{-}} > \\mathrm{I^{-}} > \\mathrm{Br^{-}} > \\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$.\n\nTherefore, in the $S_N2$ reaction with $\\mathrm{NaOCH_{3}}$, 1-tosyloxybutane will react significantly faster than 1-bromobutane because the tosylate anion is stabilized by resonance and is an excellent leaving group.

In the first step, treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl) in pyridine converts the alcohol into the corresponding tosylate (2-butyl tosylate). The key principle is that tosylation forms a sulfonate ester by replacing the O–H bond with an O–S bond; the C–O bond at the stereogenic center is not broken. Therefore, the configuration at C-2 is retained during tosylation, giving (R)-2-butyl tosylate as the product of step one. Pyridine serves as a base to neutralize HCl and facilitates formation of the tosylate.\n\nIn the second step, the secondary tosylate is dissolved in DMSO and treated with excess NaCN. Cyanide is a strong nucleophile and a relatively weak base, and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent that favors bimolecular nucleophilic substitution. The tosylate is an excellent leaving group. Therefore, the dominant pathway is an $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ displacement of the tosylate by cyanide at C-2. An $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ mechanism proceeds via backside attack and results in inversion of configuration at the stereogenic center. Since the tosylation step retained configuration and the $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ step inverts it once, the overall effect is a single inversion relative to the starting alcohol. Thus, the major product is (S)-2-cyanobutane.\n\nElimination to give but-2-ene would be minor under these conditions because cyanide favors nucleophilic substitution over elimination in a polar aprotic solvent, and racemization does not occur because the mechanism is a single, stereospecific $S_{\\mathrm{N}}2$ displacement.\n\nMatching the choices, the correct answer is (S)-2-cyanobutane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2182181"}]}
