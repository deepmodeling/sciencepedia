{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice problem provides a classic scenario where a carbocation rearrangement dictates the final product. When adding an electrophile like HCl to an alkene, the initially formed carbocation may not be the most stable one possible, leading to a structural shift. This exercise [@problem_id:2157926] challenges you to trace a 1,2-methyl shift from a secondary to a more stable tertiary carbocation, a fundamental process in organic chemistry.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is investigating the electrophilic addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes. The student treats a sample of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene with an excess of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in a suitable inert solvent. Assuming the reaction goes to completion via the most stable pathway, predict the major organic product that is formed.\n\nChoose from the following options:\nA. 2-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane\nB. 1-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane\nC. 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane\nD. 1-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane", "solution": "Label the alkene carbons in 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene as $C_1=C_2-C_3-C_4$, with $C_3$ bearing two additional methyl groups (so $C_3$ is attached to $C_2$, $C_4$, and two methyls, i.e., a quaternary carbon). Treatment with HCl proceeds by electrophilic addition via the more stable carbocation.\n\nProtonation can occur at either $C_1$ or $C_2$:\n- If $H^{+}$ adds to $C_1$, the carbocation forms at $C_2$. This $C_2^+$ is secondary (attached to $C_1$ and $C_3$ as carbon substituents).\n- If $H^{+}$ adds to $C_2$, the carbocation forms at $C_1$, which would be primary and much less stable.\n\nThus initial protonation favors addition to $C_1$ to give the secondary carbocation at $C_2$. From this $C_2^+$, a 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary $C_3$ to $C_2$ is possible. $C_3$ bears no hydrogens, so hydride shift cannot occur; the methyl shift generates a more stable tertiary carbocation at $C_3$. Chloride then captures this tertiary carbocation, placing Cl at the original $C_3$.\n\nThe resulting structure, when named along the butane parent chain to give the lowest set of locants, is 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane. This corresponds to option C. A direct Markovnikov capture without rearrangement would give 2-chloro-3,3-dimethylbutane (option A), but the rearranged product derived from the tertiary carbocation is the major product under the stated “most stable pathway” condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2157926"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous example, this practice explores a different type of migration: the 1,2-hydride shift. We will examine a reaction initiated by the diazotization of an amine, which generates a carbocation intermediate ripe for rearrangement [@problem_id:2157960]. This problem will sharpen your ability to identify the most favorable rearrangement pathway by comparing the stability of secondary and tertiary carbocations.", "problem": "The diazotization of primary amines provides a classic route for generating carbocations, which can subsequently undergo rearrangements to form more stable intermediates. Consider the reaction of optically pure (S)-3-methylbutan-2-amine when treated with an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This process generates a highly unstable diazonium salt that rapidly loses nitrogen gas to form a carbocation. This carbocation is then trapped by water to yield an alcohol.\n\nGiven the potential for structural rearrangements, identify the major alcohol product from the following options.\n\nA. 2-methylbutan-2-ol\nB. 3-methylbutan-2-ol\nC. 3-methylbutan-1-ol\nD. 2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol\nE. 1-methoxy-3-methylbutane", "solution": "The substrate is (S)-3-methylbutan-2-amine, which has the structure $CH_3-CH(CH_3)-CH(NH_2)-CH_3$. Under NaNO₂/HCl, a primary aliphatic amine is converted to an alkyldiazonium species that is highly unstable; it expels nitrogen to generate a carbocation at the carbon that originally bore the amino group. Thus, loss of $N_2$ produces a secondary carbocation at C2: $CH_3-CH(CH_3)-CH^+-CH_3$.\n\nCarbocations readily undergo 1,2-rearrangements to increase stability. The carbon adjacent to C2 (the C3 position) is a tertiary carbon which bears a hydride. A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to the C2 carbocation transfers a hydride with its bonding pair, thereby neutralizing C2 and placing the positive charge on C3. This yields a more stable tertiary carbocation: $CH_3-C^+(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3$.\n\nWater, present in the reaction medium, then captures the tertiary carbocation at C3 to give the corresponding tertiary alcohol. The resulting structure is $CH_3-C(OH)(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3$, which is 2-methylbutan-2-ol.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to option A. The unrearranged product (option B, a secondary alcohol at C2) would be minor relative to the rearranged tertiary alcohol. Options C and D would require formation of less stable primary carbocations or different rearrangements that are disfavored. Option E is an ether, not expected as the major product under aqueous acidic conditions where water is the nucleophile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2157960"}, {"introduction": "A crucial aspect of mastering carbocation chemistry is recognizing when rearrangements will not occur. This final exercise focuses on such a scenario, using an $S_N1$ reaction that begins with a highly stable tertiary carbocation [@problem_id:2157962]. Analyzing why a shift is unfavorable here will reinforce the core principle: rearrangements are driven by the pursuit of enhanced stability, and if no more stable intermediate can be formed, the structure will remain unchanged.", "problem": "The solvolysis of 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane in a protic solvent like ethanol proceeds via a Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular ($S_N1$) mechanism. A key feature of $S_N1$ reactions is the potential for the intermediate carbocation to rearrange to form a more stable carbocation, which would then lead to a mixture of constitutional isomers as products. However, in the case of 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane, it is observed that no products resulting from rearrangement are formed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best chemical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The initial carbocation formed is tertiary, and any potential 1,2-hydride or 1,2-alkyl shift would lead to a less stable secondary carbocation.\nB. The cyclohexane ring exists in a rigid chair conformation that sterically hinders the migration of a hydrogen or alkyl group.\nC. A 1,2-hydride shift would generate a positive charge on a bridgehead carbon, which is a violation of Bredt's rule.\nD. The significant steric bulk of the methyl group and the cyclohexane ring prevents the bromide leaving group from departing, thus inhibiting the $S_N1$ reaction pathway altogether.\nE. The C-Br bond is exceptionally strong due to hyperconjugation with the adjacent methyl group, which raises the activation energy for carbocation formation above the energy required for a competing $S_N2$ reaction.", "solution": "In solvolysis of 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane in a protic solvent, the rate-determining step of an $S_N1$ pathway is ionization to form the carbocation at C1. The carbon bearing the leaving group (C1) is bonded to three carbons (the methyl group, C2, and C6), so the initially formed carbocation is tertiary, which is the most stable class of simple alkyl carbocations due to greater hyperconjugation and inductive stabilization.\n\nA 1,2-rearrangement (hydride or alkyl shift) is thermodynamically favorable only if it generates a carbocation that is at least as stable as, and typically more stable than, the starting carbocation. For this substrate:\n- A 1,2-hydride shift from C2 or C6 to C1 would relocate the positive charge from C1 to C2 or C6. Each of those centers is bonded to only two carbons (C1 and the next ring carbon), so the resulting carbocation would be secondary, which is less stable than the original tertiary carbocation. Such a shift is therefore disfavored.\n- A 1,2-alkyl shift from C2 or C6 would likewise place the positive charge on C2 or C6, again producing a secondary carbocation, which is less stable than the starting tertiary carbocation. Migration of the methyl group from C1 is not the relevant 1,2-shift because the migrating group in a 1,2-rearrangement originates from the adjacent carbon, not from the cationic center itself. Ring expansion pathways that would improve stability are not available here without first passing through a less stable secondary cation, making them unfavorable.\n\nThe alternative explanations are not applicable: the cyclohexane chair does not inherently block 1,2-shifts; there is no bridgehead cation issue (Bredt’s rule is irrelevant); the reaction does proceed by $S_N1$ (so it is not inhibited by steric bulk of the leaving group), and the C-Br bond is not exceptionally strengthened by hyperconjugation in a way that contradicts the observed $S_N1$ process.\n\nTherefore, the absence of rearrangement products is best explained by the fact that the initially formed tertiary carbocation would rearrange only to less stable secondary carbocations, so rearrangement is disfavored.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2157962"}]}
