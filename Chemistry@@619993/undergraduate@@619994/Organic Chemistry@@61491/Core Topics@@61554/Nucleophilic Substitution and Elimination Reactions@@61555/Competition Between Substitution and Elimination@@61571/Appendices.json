I, II, III, IV, and V", "solution": "Identify the substrate and carbocation: 3-chloro-3-ethylpentane is a tertiary alkyl chloride. In a polar protic solvent mixture (methanol and water) under warming, tertiary alkyl halides undergo unimolecular ionization to a tertiary carbocation (SN1/E1 conditions). The leaving group departs to form the tertiary carbocation at C3. This carbocation is triethylcarbinyl in nature (the cationic center is bonded to three ethyl groups), so it is highly stabilized and there is no driving force for rearrangement (any 1,2-shift would give a secondary carbocation, which is less stable).\n\nNucleophilic substitution (SN1): Both water and methanol act as nucleophiles.\n- Capture by water followed by deprotonation gives the tertiary alcohol 3-ethylpentan-3-ol (I).\n- Capture by methanol followed by deprotonation gives the tertiary methyl ether 3-methoxy-3-ethylpentane (II).\n\nElimination (E1): From the tertiary carbocation, deprotonation at any beta carbon gives an alkene with the double bond between the cationic center and that beta carbon. The three beta positions are the methylene carbons of the three ethyl groups bonded to the cationic center; by symmetry, elimination at any of these positions yields the same constitutional alkene. The unique alkene thus formed is 3-ethylpent-2-ene (III). No distinct isomer with the double bond at another position is formed, because all beta eliminations are equivalent by symmetry, and there is no rearrangement.\n\nGeometric isomerism: The alkene has two identical ethyl substituents on the cation-side alkene carbon, so E/Z stereoisomerism is not defined. Therefore, (E)-3-ethylpent-2-ene (VI) is not a distinct product.\n\nOther listed options ruled out:\n- 2-ethylpent-1-ene (IV) would require rearrangement to a less stable secondary carbocation or a subsequent isomerization; neither is favored under these conditions.\n- 3-ethylpentan-2-ol (V) would require nucleophilic attack on a rearranged secondary carbocation; again, no rearrangement is favored from the more stable tertiary carbocation.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of neutral organic products is I (tertiary alcohol), II (tertiary methyl ether), and III (the single alkene).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160882"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's shift our focus to bimolecular reactions where the base and substrate interact in a single, concerted step. This problem asks you to compare the reactions of two isomeric primary alkyl halides with a strong, sterically hindered base [@problem_id:2160888]. By analyzing this hypothetical experiment, you'll develop a deeper intuition for how steric hindrance on the substrate can dramatically favor the elimination ($E2$) pathway over the substitution ($S_{N}2$) pathway.", "problem": "Consider two separate reactions performed under identical conditions, using potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$) in tert-butanol as the solvent.\n\nReaction A involves the reaction of 1-bromobutane with potassium tert-butoxide.\nReaction B involves the reaction of its structural isomer, 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, with potassium tert-butoxide.\n\nBased on your understanding of substitution and elimination reaction mechanisms, identify the correct statement among the choices below that best describes and compares the outcomes of Reaction A and Reaction B.\n\nA.

Both reactions predominantly form substitution products, but the ratio of substitution to elimination product is significantly greater in Reaction A than in Reaction B.\n\nE. Both reactions produce the substitution and elimination products in roughly equal amounts.", "solution": "We compare bimolecular substitution versus bimolecular elimination pathways for primary alkyl bromides under identical conditions with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol. The key mechanistic competition is between $S_N2$ and $E2$, with respective rate expressions\n$$\n\\text{rate}_{S_N2}=k_{S_N2}[\\text{RX}][\\text{Nu}^{-}],\\quad \\text{rate}_{E2}=k_{E2}[\\text{RX}][\\text{Base}].\n$$\nUnder identical concentrations, selectivity is controlled by the relative magnitudes of $k_{S_N2}$ and $k_{E2}$, which depend on steric and solvent effects and on the nature of the reagent.\n\nFirst, the reagent and solvent: $t$-BuO$^{-}$ is a strong, bulky base and a sterically hindered nucleophile. In a protic solvent such as $t$-BuOH, nucleophilicity is further attenuated by solvation, whereas basicity is less diminished relative to nucleophilicity. Consequently, $k_{S_N2}$ is suppressed more than $k_{E2}$, biasing the competition toward $E2$.\n\nSecond, substrate structure effects on each pathway:\n- For $S_N2$, steric hindrance at the $\\alpha$ and even $\\beta$ positions strongly lowers $k_{S_N2}$, and bulky nucleophiles suffer especially.\n- For $E2$, a strong base drives deprotonation of a $\\beta$-hydrogen anti to the leaving group; bulky bases favor elimination and often lead to Hofmann orientation when multiple $\\beta$ sites exist. Formation of a more substituted alkene can also thermodynamically reinforce $E2$ when accessible.\n\nApply these to each reaction.\n\nReaction A (1-bromobutane, a primary unbranched halide, with $t$-BuO$^{-}/t$-BuOH):\n- $S_N2$ is feasible for a primary substrate but is substantially slowed with $t$-BuO$^{-}$ in a protic solvent due to steric hindrance and solvation. The $S_N2$ product would be tert-butyl butyl ether.\n- $E2$ is favored by the strong bulky base. There is a single $\\beta$-carbon (C-2) bearing $\\beta$-hydrogens, so elimination leads specifically to 1-butene (the less substituted, Hofmann alkene). Because $t$-BuO$^{-}$ is bulky and $t$-BuOH is protic, $E2$ tends to predominate, though some $S_N2$ remains competitive for this unhindered primary substrate.\n\nReaction B (1-bromo-2-methylpropane, i.e., isobutyl bromide, a primary but $\\beta$-branched halide, with $t$-BuO$^{-}/t$-BuOH):\n- $\\beta$-branching markedly depresses $k_{S_N2}$ even for a primary center (the neopentyl-like effect), and this is exacerbated by the bulky, solvated $t$-BuO$^{-}$, making $S_N2$ especially disfavored.\n- $E2$ removes the single $\\beta$-hydrogen on the adjacent methine, forming 2-methylpropene, a more substituted and more stable alkene. With a strong bulky base and a protic solvent, $E2$ is strongly dominant here.\n\nTherefore, both A and B predominantly undergo $E2$ under these conditions, but the elimination-to-substitution ratio is significantly larger for Reaction B than for Reaction A due to the much greater suppression of $S_N2$ in B and the favorable formation of a highly substituted alkene.\n\nThis pattern corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160888"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice presents a fascinating puzzle that defies simple classification. We investigate a primary alkyl halide so sterically hindered near the reaction center that both the $S_{N}2$ and $E2$ pathways are effectively blocked [@problem_id:2160860].

The student prepares a solution of 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylpropane in anhydrous ethanol.

No reaction occurs", "solution": "Identify the substrate and its implications:\n- The substrate 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylpropane is a neopentyl bromide, i.e., a sterically hindered primary alkyl halide. Such substrates are exceptionally poor in $S_{N2}$ reactions due to severe steric hindrance at the $\\beta$-carbon.\n\nEvaluate $S_{N2}$:\n- Direct $S_{N2}$ displacement by $EtO^-$ to give the primary ether (choice A) is strongly disfavored because the neopentyl system blocks backside attack. Thus, A is not the major product.\n\nEvaluate $E2$:\n- An $E2$ elimination requires at least one $\\beta$-hydrogen anti to the leaving group. In neopentyl bromide, the carbon bearing the leaving group is $\\text{CH}_2\\text{Br}$, and its only adjacent carbon is quaternary (the tert-butyl carbon), which has no hydrogens. Therefore, the count of accessible $\\beta$-hydrogens is $n_{\\beta-H}=0$, so $E2$ is impossible. Hence, neither C nor D can arise via $E2$.\n\nConsider $S_{N1}/E1$ with rearrangement:\n- Although a primary carbocation is generally unstable, ionization of neopentyl bromide in polar protic solvent (ethanol) under heat can proceed because the initially formed primary carbocation immediately undergoes a rapid 1,2-alkyl (methyl) shift to a far more stable tertiary carbocation (the tert-amyl cation). Symbolically: ionization gives a neopentyl cation, which promptly rearranges via a 1,2-methyl shift to the tertiary 2-methyl-2-butyl carbocation.\n- From the tertiary carbocation, two competing pathways exist:\n  1) Nucleophilic capture by $EtO^-$ to give the tertiary ether (choice B).\n  2) Base-induced $E1$ elimination by $EtO^-$ or solvent to give the more substituted alkene by Zaitsev’s rule.\n- Under the given conditions (strong base $EtO^-$ in ethanol and heating), elimination is favored over substitution from a tertiary carbocation, leading predominantly to the Zaitsev alkene. Deprotonation at the appropriate site furnishes the more substituted alkene, 2-methyl-2-butene, rather than the less substituted 2-methyl-1-butene. Therefore, the major product is 2-methyl-2-butene (choice C), formed via rearrangement followed by $E1$ elimination.\n\nConclusion:\n- $S_{N2}$ to give A is suppressed.\n- $E2$ is impossible since $n_{\\beta-H}=0$.\n- Rearrangement enables a tertiary carbocation, and under basic, heated conditions, $E1$ gives the Zaitsev alkene, 2-methyl-2-butene.\n- Thus, the major product is choice C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160860"}]}
