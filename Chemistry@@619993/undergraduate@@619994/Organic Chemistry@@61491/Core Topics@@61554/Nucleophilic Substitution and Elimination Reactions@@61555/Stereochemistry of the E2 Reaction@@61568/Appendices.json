The E2 reaction can only occur if there is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent (or $\\beta$) to the carbon bearing the leaving group. This exercise [@problem_id:2202224] challenges you to apply this foundational rule by analyzing a substrate where the structure limits elimination to a single possible pathway.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is investigating elimination reactions. The student decides to treat a pure sample of (S)-3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutane with a solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol at a slightly elevated temperature. Assuming the reaction proceeds to completion via the expected major pathway under these conditions, identify the structure of the principal alkene product formed.\n\nChoose the correct option from the list below:\n\nA. The major product is (E)-3,3-dimethylbut-2-ene.\n\nB. The major product is (Z)-3,3-dimethylbut-2-ene.\n\nC. An equimolar mixture of (E)- and (Z)-3,3-dimethylbut-2-ene is formed.\n\nD. The major product is 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene.\n\nE. No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "Identify the substrate connectivity: 3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutane is CH3–C(CH3)2–CH(Br)–CH3. Numbering the main chain as C1–C2–C3–C4, the bromide is on C3 and there are two methyl groups on C2. The absolute configuration at C3 is given as (S), but for the major elimination pathway, the absolute configuration will not affect which alkene skeleton forms.\n\nUnder potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol at slightly elevated temperature, a strong, bulky base in a protic solvent, the expected pathway for a secondary bromide is a concerted E2 elimination. The key mechanistic requirements for E2 are:\n- A $\\beta$-hydrogen anti-periplanar to the C–Br bond.\n- Abstraction of that $\\beta$-hydrogen by base, with simultaneous loss of bromide, forming the alkene.\n\nIdentify $\\beta$-carbons relative to C3 (the carbon bearing Br): these are C2 and C4. Check for available $\\beta$-hydrogens:\n- C2 is a quaternary carbon (it is bonded to C1 and to two methyl groups as well as to C3), so it bears no hydrogens. Therefore, no elimination can form a double bond between C2 and C3.\n- C4 is a methyl group and has $\\beta$-hydrogens available. In a flexible acyclic system, a conformation exists with one of these C4–H bonds anti-periplanar to the departing C3–Br bond, satisfying the stereoelectronic requirement for E2.\n\nTherefore, the only possible E2 elimination removes a hydrogen from C4 and bromide from C3 to form the C3=C4 double bond, giving the product CH3–C(CH3)2–CH=CH2. This alkene is a terminal double bond; thus, E/Z stereoisomerism does not apply. The correct IUPAC name is 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene.\n\nSince there is no $\\beta$-hydrogen at C2, internal 3,3-dimethylbut-2-ene (either E or Z) cannot form. The reaction does occur under the stated conditions, and only the terminal alkene is formed via the accessible $\\beta$-site.\n\nThus, the principal product is 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2202224"}, {"introduction": "The E2 reaction's strict geometric requirements are most vividly illustrated in cyclic systems like cyclohexanes, where reactivity is governed by conformational analysis. For an efficient E2 elimination to occur, the leaving group and a $\\beta$-hydrogen must adopt a trans-diaxial alignment, which is a perfect anti-periplanar arrangement. This practice [@problem_id:2202189] will guide you in using chair conformations to predict which stereoisomer reacts faster, connecting the abstract stereoelectronic rule to tangible differences in reaction rates.", "problem": "Consider the two stereoisomers of 1-bromo-3-isopropylcyclohexane (cis and trans). Both isomers are placed in separate flasks and subjected to reaction conditions with a strong, non-nucleophilic base, promoting an Elimination, Bimolecular (E2) reaction. The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement for the arrangement of the leaving group and the proton being abstracted.\n\nBased on an analysis of the chair conformations of each isomer, which of the following statements correctly predicts the relative rates of the E2 reaction and provides the correct justification?\n\nA. The cis-isomer reacts faster because in its most stable conformation, the substituents are arranged to minimize steric strain, allowing the base to approach a beta-proton more easily.\n\nB. The trans-isomer reacts faster because its most stable chair conformation places the bromine atom in an axial position, which allows it to be anti-periplanar to axial beta-protons.\n\nC. The cis-isomer reacts faster because it can more easily achieve a conformation where the bulky isopropyl group is axial, which in turn forces the bromine atom into a reactive axial position.\n\nD. Both isomers react at approximately the same rate because the energy barrier for chair interconversion is low, allowing both to access the reactive conformation required for elimination.\n\nE. The trans-isomer reacts faster because the bulky isopropyl group sterically hinders the base from attacking the bromine atom, thus favoring elimination over substitution.", "solution": "Step 1: State the stereoelectronic requirement for the E2 reaction on cyclohexanes. An E2 elimination requires the leaving group and the abstracted beta-hydrogen to be anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane chair, this corresponds to a trans-diaxial arrangement: the leaving group must be axial to be anti-periplanar to an axial beta-hydrogen on an adjacent carbon.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conformations of 1,3-disubstituted cyclohexanes. For 1,3-disubstitution, the cis isomer is either diaxial or diequatorial in a given chair, whereas the trans isomer is axial-equatorial (and interconverts to equatorial-axial upon chair flip).\n\nStep 3: Compare substituent preferences. The isopropyl group is bulkier than bromine, so the lowest-energy conformer places the isopropyl group equatorial whenever possible.\n\nStep 4: Apply to the cis isomer. For cis-1-bromo-3-isopropylcyclohexane, the lowest-energy conformer is diequatorial (both substituents equatorial), which places the bromine equatorial and therefore not aligned for E2. The alternative diaxial conformer would put both substituents axial, which is strongly destabilized; although it provides the required axial bromine and trans-diaxial beta-hydrogen relationship, its population is very small. Therefore, the cis isomer reacts slowly under E2 conditions because the reactive conformer is high in energy and minimally populated.\n\nStep 5: Apply to the trans isomer. For trans-1-bromo-3-isopropylcyclohexane, the two chair conformers are axial-equatorial interconverting with equatorial-axial. The lower-energy conformer places the bulky isopropyl group equatorial, which forces the bromine into the axial position. This conformation is already reactive for E2 because the axial bromine is anti-periplanar to an axial beta-hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (trans-diaxial). Thus, the trans isomer reacts faster.\n\nStep 6: Choose the correct option. The statement that the trans isomer reacts faster because its most stable chair conformation places the bromine axial, enabling the necessary anti-periplanar alignment with axial beta-hydrogens, is correct. This corresponds to option B. The other options either ignore the trans-diaxial requirement (A, D), misstate the conformational preferences (C), or offer incorrect mechanistic justification (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2202189"}, {"introduction": "A true test of understanding is the ability to work in reverse, using experimental outcomes to deduce the structure of an unknown reactant. The stereospecific nature of the E2 reaction means that the identity of the product(s) provides crucial clues about the starting material's stereochemistry. In this problem [@problem_id:2202202], you will act as a chemical detective, using the exclusive formation of a specific alkene to determine the relative stereochemistry of the starting material by identifying which geometries make the alternative elimination pathway impossible.", "problem": "An unknown stereoisomer of 1-chloro-2,3-dimethylcyclohexane is treated with a strong, non-bulky base, promoting a bimolecular elimination (E2) reaction. It is observed that the reaction yields exclusively 3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene as the only alkene product. Based on this outcome, determine the possible relative stereochemistry of the starting material. The relative positions of the substituents are described as *cis* (on the same side of the ring) or *trans* (on opposite sides of the ring).\n\nSelect all valid options.\n\nA. The chloro group at C1 is *cis* to the methyl group at C2, and the methyl group at C2 is *cis* to the methyl group at C3.\n\nB. The chloro group at C1 is *cis* to the methyl group at C2, and the methyl group at C2 is *trans* to the methyl group at C3.\n\nC. The chloro group at C1 is *trans* to the methyl group at C2, and the methyl group at C2 is *cis* to the methyl group at C3.\n\nD. The chloro group at C1 is *trans* to the methyl group at C2, and the methyl group at C2 is *trans* to the methyl group at C3.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the relative stereochemistry of a 1-chloro-2,3-dimethylcyclohexane isomer that yields only 3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene upon an E2 reaction.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the reaction and products.\nThe starting material is 1-chloro-2,3-dimethylcyclohexane. The base-promoted E2 reaction involves the removal of the chloro group from C1 and a proton from an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n- Elimination of H from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding the Zaitsev product: 2,3-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.\n- Elimination of H from C6 would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding the Hofmann product: 3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.\n\nThe problem states that *only* 3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene (the Hofmann product) is formed. This means that the pathway leading to the Zaitsev product is completely blocked.\n\nStep 2: Apply the stereochemical requirement for the E2 reaction.\nThe E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Cl) and the proton being eliminated must be anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this corresponds to a 1,2-diaxial arrangement. That is, both the leaving group and the proton must be in axial positions and on opposite faces of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down).\n\nStep 3: Deduce the necessary geometry in the reactive conformation.\nFor any E2 elimination to occur from a cyclohexane derivative, the leaving group (Cl) must be in an axial position. Let's call the chair conformation with an axial chlorine the \"reactive conformer\".\n- The formation of the Hofmann product (from C6-H elimination) requires an axial proton on C6 that is anti-periplanar to the axial Cl.\n- The fact that the Zaitsev product (from C2-H elimination) is *not* formed means that there is no axial proton on C2 that is anti-periplanar to the axial Cl in any accessible reactive conformer.\n\nThe only way for C2 not to have an available anti-periplanar proton is if its proton is equatorial. If the proton on C2 is equatorial, the methyl group on C2 must be axial.\n\nTherefore, the key condition is that in the reactive chair conformation, both the chloro group at C1 and the methyl group at C2 must be in axial positions.\n\nStep 4: Relate the diaxial requirement to relative stereochemistry.\nIn a cyclohexane ring, a 1,2-diaxial relationship between two substituents on adjacent carbons means they are *trans* to each other. Thus, the chloro group at C1 must be *trans* to the methyl group at C2. This immediately eliminates options A and B. We now only need to evaluate options C and D.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the diastereomers with a C1-Cl, C2-Me *trans* relationship.\n\nCase C: C1-Cl is *trans* to C2-Me; C2-Me is *cis* to C3-Me.\nLet's analyze the two chair conformations of this isomer. We can define the relative \"up/down\" positions: a 1,2-trans relationship is up/down, and a 2,3-cis relationship is down/down. So, we have C1(up), C2(down), C3(down).\n- Conformer 1: Let's place the groups to maximize stability (equatorial positions). C1-Cl(eq, up), C2-Me(ax, down), C3-Me(eq, down). This conformer has one axial methyl group. The chloro group is equatorial, so this conformer is unreactive in an E2 reaction.\n- Conformer 2 (ring flip): The substituents switch to C1-Cl(ax, up), C2-Me(eq, down), C3-Me(ax, down). This conformer has an axial chloro group, so it is the reactive conformer.\n- Let's analyze the protons in this reactive conformer. The C1-Cl is axial and \"up\". For an E2 reaction, we need a proton that is axial and \"down\" on an adjacent carbon.\n  - At C2, the methyl group is equatorial (\"down\"), so the proton is axial and \"up\". This proton is *syn*-periplanar to the axial Cl, not anti-periplanar. Therefore, Zaitsev elimination is impossible.\n  - At C6, there is an axial proton pointing \"down\". This proton is anti-periplanar to the axial Cl. Therefore, Hofmann elimination is possible.\n- Conclusion for C: This isomer reacts via its less stable conformer to produce *only* the Hofmann product. This matches the problem's description.\n\nCase D: C1-Cl is *trans* to C2-Me; C2-Me is *trans* to C3-Me.\nLet's define the relative \"up/down\" positions: 1,2-trans is up/down, and 2,3-trans is down/up. So, we have C1(up), C2(down), C3(up).\n- Conformer 1 (the all-equatorial conformer): C1-Cl(eq, up), C2-Me(eq, down), C3-Me(eq, up). All bulky groups are equatorial. This is a very stable conformer. However, since the chloro group is equatorial, this conformer is unreactive.\n- Conformer 2 (ring flip, the all-axial conformer): C1-Cl(ax, up), C2-Me(ax, down), C3-Me(ax, up). This conformer is very unstable due to multiple 1,3-diaxial interactions. However, it is the only conformer from which E2 elimination can proceed.\n- Let's analyze the protons in this reactive conformer. The C1-Cl is axial and \"up\".\n  - At C2, the methyl group is axial (\"down\"), so the proton is equatorial (\"up\"). There is no axial proton anti-periplanar to the Cl. Therefore, Zaitsev elimination is impossible.\n  - At C6, there is an axial proton pointing \"down\". This proton is anti-periplanar to the axial Cl. Therefore, Hofmann elimination is possible.\n- Conclusion for D: This isomer must adopt a very high-energy, all-axial conformation to react. When it does, it can only form the Hofmann product. This also matches the problem's description.\n\nStep 6: Final Conclusion.\nBoth stereoisomers described in options C and D, upon E2 elimination, can only form the Hofmann product (3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene) because the Zaitsev pathway is geometrically forbidden in their respective reactive conformations. Therefore, both C and D are valid possibilities for the starting material.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CD}$$", "id": "2202202"}]}
