This practice delves into what makes a good leaving group by comparing a simple halide with a more complex sulfonate ester. Through this problem, you will explore the relationship between a leaving group's stability, its basicity, and the powerful effect of resonance delocalization, providing a deeper understanding of this critical component in substitution reactions [@problem_id:2178732].", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is planning to synthesize an ether via a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution ($S_N2$) reaction. The plan involves reacting an alkyl substrate with sodium methoxide ($NaOCH_3$). Two possible starting alkyl substrates are available: alkyl chloride (R-Cl) and alkyl tosylate (R-OTs). The rate of the $S_N2$ reaction is highly dependent on the ability of the leaving group to depart.\n\nTo help decide which substrate will react faster, the student finds the $pK_a$ values for the conjugate acids of the two potential leaving groups, chloride ($Cl^-$) and tosylate ($OTs^-$):\n- The $pK_a$ of hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) is approximately -7.\n- The $pK_a$ of p-toluenesulfonic acid ($TsOH$) is approximately -2.8.\n\nBased on the principles governing leaving group ability in $S_N2$ reactions, which of the following statements correctly identifies the superior leaving group and provides the most accurate justification?\n\nA. Chloride ($Cl^-$) is the superior leaving group because its conjugate acid, $HCl$, has a lower $pK_a$, which indicates that $Cl^-$ is a weaker and therefore more stable base.\n\nB. Tosylate ($OTs^-$) is the superior leaving group because its conjugate acid, $TsOH$, has a higher $pK_a$, which indicates that $OTs^-$ is a stronger and therefore more reactive base.\n\nC. Tosylate ($OTs^-$) is the superior leaving group because the negative charge on the anion is delocalized through resonance over three oxygen atoms, making it an exceptionally stable and weak base.\n\nD. Chloride ($Cl^-$) is the superior leaving group because it is a smaller atom than the bulky tosylate group, leading to less steric hindrance as it departs from the substrate.\n\nE. Both leaving groups are equally effective because the $pK_a$ values of their conjugate acids are both very negative, implying that both $Cl^-$ and $OTs^-$ are very weak bases and thus excellent leaving groups.", "solution": "For a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution, the rate law is\n$$v = k[\\text{R-LG}][\\text{Nu}^{-}],$$\nand for a given substrate structure and nucleophile, a better leaving group increases the rate constant $k$. Leaving group ability correlates inversely with basicity: the more stable (weaker) the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. A commonly invoked relation is that lower $pK_a$ of the conjugate acid $HA$ implies a weaker conjugate base $A^-$ and thus a better leaving group within a given class of related anions.\n\nThe two candidate leaving groups are $Cl^-$ and $OTs^-$. The given $pK_a$ values are\n$$pK_{a}(HCl) \\approx -7,\\quad pK_{a}(TsOH) \\approx -2.8.$$\nOn a purely numerical comparison in water, $HCl$ is the stronger acid, which would suggest $Cl^-$ is the weaker base relative to $OTs^-$. However, leaving group ability in $S_N2$ reactions is governed by the intrinsic stability of the departing anion under the reaction conditions. Sulfonate anions such as $OTs^-$ are exceptionally stabilized because the negative charge is delocalized by resonance over three oxygen atoms of the sulfonyl group:\n- the anion has multiple resonance contributors distributing charge over the three oxygens,\n- the strongly electron-withdrawing $\\text{SO}_2$ group exerts an inductive effect that further stabilizes the anion.\n\nThis resonance delocalization makes $OTs^-$ a very weak base and an excellent leaving group, superior to $Cl^-$ in typical $S_N2$ conditions. The well-established empirical leaving group order reflects this:\n$$OTs^- \\gg I^- > Br^- > Cl^- \\gg F^-.$$\n\nTherefore, the correct identification and justification is that tosylate is the superior leaving group because its negative charge is delocalized through resonance over three oxygen atoms, rendering it exceptionally stable and weakly basic. Option C states precisely this. Options A and D incorrectly conclude chloride is superior; A overgeneralizes the $pK_a$ rule across dissimilar anion families, and D misattributes leaving group ability to steric size. Option B incorrectly claims a stronger base is a better leaving group. Option E is incorrect because the two leaving groups are not equally effective; $OTs^-$ is markedly better.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2178732"}, {"introduction": "While the $S_N2$ reaction is a concerted, single-step process, the unimolecular ($S_N1$) pathway involves a discrete carbocation intermediate. This fundamental difference opens the door to fascinating and sometimes unexpected outcomes. This problem presents a classic scenario where an initially formed carbocation can rearrange to a more stable species before being captured by the nucleophile, a hallmark of the $S_N1$ mechanism that is crucial for correctly predicting reaction products [@problem_id:2178723].", "problem": "Consider the solvolysis reaction of 2-bromo-3-methylbutane when it is gently heated in a large excess of ethanol.

Under these conditions, the reaction proceeds via a mechanism that involves a carbocation intermediate, and may form one or more isomeric substitution products. Your task is to identify the major organic substitution product formed.\n\nWhich of the following compounds represents the major substitution product of this reaction?\n\nA. 2-ethoxy-3-methylbutane\n\nB. 1-ethoxy-3-methylbutane\n\nC. 2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane\n\nD. 2-methyl-2-butanol\n\nE. 3-methyl-1-butene", "solution": "We analyze the substrate 2-bromo-3-methylbutane, which can be written as CH3-CH(Br)-CH(CH3)-CH3. In a large excess of ethanol under gentle heating, a polar protic solvent and weak nucleophile/base are present, so solvolysis proceeds predominantly by an $S_N1/E1$ pathway.\n\nStep 1: Formation of the carbocation. Ionization of the Câ€“Br bond occurs to give a secondary carbocation at C2:\n$\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}^+\\text{-CH(CH}_3\\text{)-CH}_3 + \\text{Br}^-$.\nThis follows the $S_N1$ principle that the rate-determining step is ionization to form a carbocation intermediate.\n\nStep 2: Carbocation rearrangement. Carbocation stability follows the order tertiary greater than secondary greater than primary. The secondary carbocation at C2 is adjacent to C3, which bears a hydrogen and two alkyl groups (C4-CH3 and a methyl substituent). A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to C2 generates a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3:\n$\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-C}^+(\\text{CH}_3)\\text{-CH}_3$.\nThis is favored by the principle that rearrangements (1,2-hydride shifts) occur when they lead to a more stable carbocation.\n\nStep 3: Nucleophilic capture by ethanol. The solvent ethanol, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the tertiary carbocation at C3 to form the oxonium intermediate:\n$\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-C(OEtH)}^+(\\text{CH}_3)\\text{-CH}_3$.\n\nStep 4: Deprotonation. A base (ethanol or bromide) removes the extra proton from oxygen to give the neutral ether:\nCH3-CH2-C(OEt)(CH3)-CH3.\n\nStep 5: Identify the major substitution product. Naming the product using the lowest locants for substituents on the longest chain gives 2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane. This corresponds to option C. Unrearranged substitution (option A, 2-ethoxy-3-methylbutane) would arise from direct capture of the initial secondary carbocation and is minor relative to the rearranged tertiary product. Elimination products (such as option E) and formation of an alcohol (option D) are not the major substitution product under these solvolysis conditions in ethanol.\n\nTherefore, the major substitution product is 2-ethoxy-2-methylbutane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2178723"}]}
