The overall reaction is:\n$$ (CH_3)_3CCl + H_2O \\rightarrow (CH_3)_3COH + HCl $$\nAn experiment is conducted to study the kinetics of this reaction at a constant temperature. The reaction is observed to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to tert-butyl chloride.

Ionization of the C–Br bond at C1 forms a secondary cyclohexyl cation centered at C1, adjacent to C2 which bears a methyl substituent. \n\nCarbocation stability dictates the next step: a 1,2-hydride shift from C2 to the cationic C1 generates a more stable tertiary carbocation at C2 (now bearing bonds to C1, C3, and the methyl substituent). Such a tertiary carbocation is favored over the initial secondary carbocation, so the rearrangement occurs faster than nucleophilic capture of the initial cation.\n\nMethanol, acting as the nucleophile, then attacks the tertiary carbocation at C2 to give the substitution product in which methoxy and methyl are geminal on the same ring carbon. This constitutional isomer is named by numbering the substituted carbon as C1, giving 1-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexane. \n\nIf no rearrangement occurred, direct capture at C1 would give 1-methoxy-2-methylcyclohexane, but the rearranged tertiary pathway is favored.
