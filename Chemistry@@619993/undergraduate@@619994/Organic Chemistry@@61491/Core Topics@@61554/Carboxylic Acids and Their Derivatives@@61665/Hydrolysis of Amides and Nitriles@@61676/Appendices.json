This practice challenges you to do just that. By analyzing the products of a base-catalyzed amide hydrolysis, you can piece together the structure of the original unknown compound, a skill fundamental to synthetic planning and chemical analysis [@problem_id:2176323].", "problem": "An unknown organic compound, identified as a primary amide, is subjected to reaction with a hot aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The reaction is allowed to proceed until completion. Subsequent analysis of the reaction mixture reveals the formation of two principal products: one organic and one inorganic. The organic product is determined to be sodium pentanoate, and the inorganic product is identified as ammonia gas.\n\nBased on this experimental outcome, determine the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the original primary amide from the options provided below.\n\nA.

Butanamide", "solution": "We are told the unknown is a primary amide and that hot aqueous sodium hydroxide converts it completely into two principal products: sodium pentanoate (organic) and ammonia (inorganic). The key chemical principle is base-promoted hydrolysis of amides. For a primary amide of general formula $\\mathrm{RCONH_{2}}$, hot aqueous base effects hydrolysis to the carboxylate salt and ammonia, according to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RCONH_{2} + NaOH \\longrightarrow RCOO^{-}\\ Na^{+} + NH_{3}}\n$$\nBecause the organic product is sodium pentanoate, the carboxylate anion must be the pentanoate anion. This implies the carbon skeleton of the original amide corresponds to pentanamide, since base hydrolysis preserves the carbon framework at the carbonyl carbon and produces the carboxylate of the same acid (aside from deprotonation). Therefore, the original amide must be pentanamide:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}CONH_{2} \\xrightarrow[\\text{hot}]{\\mathrm{NaOH(aq)}} CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}COO^{-}\\ Na^{+} + NH_{3}}\n$$\nVerification against the options:\n- A. Pentanamide: primary amide; yields sodium pentanoate and $\\mathrm{NH_{3}}$; matches the observation.\n- B. N-Methylbutanamide: a secondary amide $\\mathrm{RCONHR'}$; base hydrolysis would yield sodium butanoate and methylamine $\\mathrm{CH_{3}NH_{2}}$, not ammonia.\n- C. 2-Methylbutanamide: a primary amide; would yield sodium 2-methylbutanoate, not sodium pentanoate.\n- D. N,N-Dimethylpropanamide: a tertiary amide; would not yield ammonia and would give propanoate with dimethylamine under hydrolysis.\n- E.

This exercise provides a valuable glimpse into the mechanism of nitrile hydrolysis by presenting a scenario where the reaction is stopped midway. By identifying the stable intermediate, you will reinforce the close relationship between nitriles and amides and appreciate that the amide is not just a separate functional group to be hydrolyzed, but also a key waypoint on the path from a nitrile to a carboxylic acid [@problem_id:2176343].", "problem": "An organic chemist is attempting to synthesize a carboxylic acid from its corresponding nitrile. The starting material for the synthesis is acetonitrile ($CH_3CN$). The procedure involves heating the nitrile in the presence of dilute aqueous sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). Due to an oversight, the reaction is terminated before it reaches completion. Analysis of the reaction mixture reveals that a significant amount of a stable intermediate has been formed, which is the major organic product instead of the expected carboxylic acid.\n\nFrom the options below, select the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major organic product isolated from this incomplete hydrolysis reaction.\n\nA.

N-methylethanamide\n\nE. 2-aminoethenol", "solution": "Under dilute aqueous acid and heat, nitriles undergo stepwise hydrolysis via a stable amide intermediate to give the corresponding carboxylic acid. The general sequence is:\n1) Acid-catalyzed hydration of the nitrile to an amide.\n2) Further acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the amide to a carboxylic acid.\n\nApplying this to acetonitrile, the transformations are:\n$$\nCH_{3}CN \\xrightarrow[\\text{H_{2}O}]{\\text{H_{2}SO_{4}, \\ \\Delta}} CH_{3}CONH_{2} \\xrightarrow[\\text{H_{2}O}]{\\text{H_{2}SO_{4}, \\ \\Delta}} CH_{3}COOH\n$$\nThe first step produces the amide $CH_{3}CONH_{2}$ (acetamide, IUPAC name ethanamide), which is a stable, isolable intermediate. Since the reaction was terminated before completion, the major organic product will be this amide rather than the final carboxylic acid.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (acetic acid) is the product of complete hydrolysis, not the major product in an incomplete reaction.\n- B (ethanamide) is the amide intermediate formed from acetonitrile under these conditions and is the expected major product upon incomplete hydrolysis.\n- C (acetonitrile) is the starting material; the prompt specifies a significant amount of a stable intermediate is formed as the major product.\n- D (N-methylethanamide) would require methylation of the amide nitrogen, which does not occur under simple aqueous sulfuric acid hydrolysis.\n- E (2-aminoethenol) does not correspond to the amide intermediate; the transient imidic acid tautomer is not the isolated major product under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name for the major product is ethanamide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2176343"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond two-dimensional structures, this problem introduces the crucial dimension of stereochemistry. Molecules possess a three-dimensional architecture, and understanding how a reaction affects this architecture is a cornerstone of modern organic chemistry. This practice asks you to consider whether a chemical transformation at one end of a molecule—the hydrolysis of a nitrile group—can affect a distant chiral center, forcing you to think critically about the reaction mechanism and its spatial consequences [@problem_id:2176362].", "problem": "A chemist performs a complete acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a chiral nitrile, specifically (S)-3-methylpentanenitrile.

Under acidic, aqueous, heated conditions, a nitrile undergoes complete hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid via an amide intermediate. The overall stoichiometry of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a nitrile is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R{-}C{\\equiv}N} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_{2}O} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{H^{+}}} \\mathrm{R{-}COOH} + \\mathrm{NH_{4}^{+}}.\n$$\nMechanistically, protonation of the nitrile nitrogen activates the $\\mathrm{C\\equiv N}$ bond toward nucleophilic addition by water, forming an imidate that tautomerizes to the corresponding amide. Further acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the amide yields the carboxylic acid and ammonium. Throughout these steps, the carbon skeleton remains intact and there is no formation or breaking of the $\\mathrm{C{-}C}$ bond at the stereogenic center.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome is dictated by whether the chiral center is involved in any step that could lead to racemization (such as formation of a planar carbocation at that center or enolization at that center). In this case, the stereocenter is at $\\mathrm{C3}$, while the functional group being transformed is at $\\mathrm{C1}$ (the nitrile carbon becoming the carboxyl carbon). No bond is made or broken at $\\mathrm{C3}$, and under these conditions there is no mechanism that would cause racemization at $\\mathrm{C3}$ (acid-catalyzed enolization affects the $\\alpha$-carbon to the carbonyl, which after hydrolysis is $\\mathrm{C2}$, not $\\mathrm{C3}$). Therefore, the absolute configuration at $\\mathrm{C3}$ is retained.\n\nConsequently, complete acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of (S)-3-methylpentanenitrile gives (S)-3-methylpentanoic acid as the major product. Options inconsistent with this include:\n- B, which would require inversion at $\\mathrm{C3}$;\n- C, which would require racemization at $\\mathrm{C3}$;\n- D, which is an amine obtainable by reduction of a nitrile, not hydrolysis;\n- E, which is the amide intermediate and not the product of complete hydrolysis.\n\nThus, the correct choice is (S)-3-methylpentanoic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2176362"}]}
