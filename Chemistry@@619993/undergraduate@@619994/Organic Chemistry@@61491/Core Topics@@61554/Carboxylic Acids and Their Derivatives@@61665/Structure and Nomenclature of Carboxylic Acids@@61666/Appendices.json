By dissecting this error, you will sharpen your ability to look beyond superficial structures and apply the core principles of nomenclature with precision.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is working on synthesizing an organic compound. After spectral analysis, the student confidently identifies the product as an acyclic carboxylic acid and proposes the name '3-propylbutanoic acid' according to the rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). However, this name is incorrect because it violates a fundamental IUPAC rule. Your task is to identify the specific error in the student's application of the IUPAC nomenclature rules for this molecule.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the error made in naming the compound '3-propylbutanoic acid'?\n\nA. The principal functional group was incorrectly identified.\n\nB. The parent chain was numbered from the wrong end.\n\nC. The parent chain was not the longest continuous carbon chain containing the principal functional group.\n\nD. The substituent was named incorrectly.\n\nE. The substituents were not listed in alphabetical order.", "solution": "Apply IUPAC nomenclature rules step by step:\n1) Identify the principal functional group. For an acyclic carboxylic acid, the carboxyl group is the highest-priority functional group and must define the suffix “-oic acid”. Thus the functional group identification in the student’s name is not the source of error.\n2) Select the parent chain. The IUPAC rule requires choosing the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the carboxyl carbon. In the proposed name “3-propylbutanoic acid,” the parent chosen is a four-carbon chain (butanoic acid) with a propyl substituent at carbon 3. However, at the branching carbon, one can trace a longer continuous chain by proceeding through the three-carbon substituent instead of continuing to the terminal methyl of the four-carbon chain. This yields a six-carbon chain that still contains the carboxyl carbon, so the correct parent should be hexanoic acid rather than butanoic acid. Consequently, the proposed name violates the “longest chain containing the principal functional group” rule.\n3) Numbering and substituent naming are not the primary issues once the correct parent is chosen; with the six-carbon parent, the structure corresponds to a methyl-substituted hexanoic acid (e.g., 3-methylhexanoic acid), confirming that the initial error lies in parent-chain selection.\nTherefore, the specific error is that the parent chain was not the longest continuous chain containing the principal functional group, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2204951"}, {"introduction": "Nomenclature is not just about assigning names; it's a language that describes molecular structure and properties.

Numbering from the carboxyl carbon: C1 is the carboxyl carbon, C2 is $\\text{CH}_2$, C3 is $\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$. Since there are two identical $\\text{CH}_3$ groups on C3, C3 is not bonded to four different groups; thus the molecule is achiral. Although it is a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons, it fails the chirality condition.\n\nB. Pentanoic acid: This is a straight-chain carboxylic acid with 5 carbons. There is no stereogenic center because no carbon is bonded to four different groups. It is achiral.\n\nC. 2,2-Dimethylpropanoic acid: Total carbons are 5. The quaternary carbon at C2 is bonded to three identical $\\text{CH}_3$ groups and the carboxyl-bearing carbon; it does not have four different substituents, so the molecule is achiral.\n\nD. 2-Methylbutanoic acid: The parent is butanoic acid (4 carbons) plus one methyl substituent at C2, giving 5 total carbons. At C2, the substituents are $\\text{H}$, a $\\text{CH}_3$ group (the 2-methyl), a $\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$ group (the rest of the chain), and a $\\text{COOH}$ group (C1). These are four different groups, so C2 is a stereogenic center and the molecule is chiral. It is also a carboxylic acid with exactly 5 carbons.\n\nE. 3-Methylpentanoic acid: The parent pentanoic acid has 5 carbons; adding a methyl substituent makes 6 total carbons.

The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid, and the longest continuous carbon chain containing this group consists of seven carbon atoms. The carboxyl carbon is designated as carbon-1.\n2.  A single carbon-carbon double bond is present between carbon-4 and carbon-5.\n3.  A single methyl group is attached to carbon-3, which is a chiral center.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the molecule is specified as follows:\n-   At the chiral center (carbon-3), the substituent with the lowest Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority is oriented away from the observer. When viewed from this perspective, the sequence from the highest-priority substituent to the second-highest priority, and then to the third-highest priority, traces a clockwise path.\n-   With respect to the double bond between carbon-4 and carbon-5, the substituent of higher CIP priority on carbon-4 and the substituent of higher CIP priority on carbon-5 are located on opposite sides of the double bond's axis.\n\nBased on this information, determine the complete and correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for this compound from the options provided below.\n\nA.

(5S, 3E)-5-methylhept-3-enoic acid", "solution": "The principal functional group is a carboxylic acid and the parent chain containing it has seven carbons with the carboxyl carbon as carbon-1, so the base name is hept-4-enoic acid, with a double bond between carbons 4 and 5, and a methyl substituent at carbon-3. Thus, the skeletal name is 3-methylhept-4-enoic acid.\n\nAssigning the absolute configuration at carbon-3 by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules:\n- The four substituents at C-3 are: hydrogen, methyl (C), the C-2 side leading to the carboxyl group (C), and the C-4 side leading toward the double bond (C).\n- We compare the atoms attached to each of these carbons. The C-4 substituent is a vinyl carbon, which counts higher than the $\\text{CH}_2$ of the C-2 side. The methyl carbon is lower still. The priority order is: vinyl group (C-4 side) > ethyl-like group (C-2 side) > methyl group > hydrogen (lowest).\n- The problem states that with the lowest-priority substituent oriented away, the sequence from highest to second to third is clockwise. By the R/S convention, this corresponds to the R configuration at C-3. Therefore, the stereodescriptor at the chiral center is (3R).\n\nAssigning the double-bond configuration at C-4/C-5:\n- At C-4, the two substituents are H and the C-3 side; the C-3 side has higher priority than H.\n- At C-5, the two substituents are H and the C-6 side; the C-6 side has higher priority than H.\n- The problem states that the higher-priority substituents on C-4 and C-5 lie on opposite sides, which defines the E configuration. Therefore, the double bond is (4E).\n\nCombining these, the correct IUPAC name is (3R, 4E)-3-methylhept-4-enoic acid, which corresponds to option A. Options with Z, S, or with different locants (such as 5-methylhept-3-enoic acid) do not match the specified structure and stereochemistry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2204970"}]}
