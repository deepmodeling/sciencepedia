However, their high electrophilicity requires careful selection of reagents to achieve the desired transformation. This practice explores the concept of chemoselectivity by comparing the reaction of benzoyl chloride with two different types of nucleophiles, demonstrating how one can either fully reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol or selectively form a new carbon-carbon bond to produce a ketone [@problem_id:2194278].", "problem": "An organic chemistry student is exploring the different outcomes of reactions involving acyl chlorides. The student performs two separate experiments starting from the same material, benzoyl chloride.\n\nIn Experiment 1, benzoyl chloride is dissolved in dry diethyl ether and treated with an excess amount of lithium aluminum hydride ($LiAlH_4$). The reaction is then quenched by the careful addition of water. The major organic product of this reaction is designated as Product A.\n\nIn Experiment 2, a fresh sample of benzoyl chloride is dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran and cooled. It is then treated with lithium dimethylcuprate ($(CH_3)_2CuLi$). After the reaction is complete, it is also subjected to an aqueous workup.

This exercise focuses on the nucleophilic acyl substitution of a cyclic anhydride, a common strategy for synthesizing molecules with multiple functional groups. By reacting glutaric anhydride with an amine, you will explore the ring-opening mechanism that yields a valuable amide-acid product, reinforcing the fundamental principles of anhydride reactivity [@problem_id:2194301].", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis, glutaric anhydride is treated with an equimolar amount of ethylamine in a suitable solvent at room temperature.

This problem presents a classic scenario where a seemingly straightforward Friedel-Crafts acylation fails due to competing reactivity within the starting material itself. By analyzing the interaction between the Lewis acid catalyst and the basic amino group of aniline, you will uncover why N-acylation outcompetes the expected C-acylation of the aromatic ring, a crucial lesson in reaction design [@problem_id:2194325].", "problem": "An undergraduate chemist attempts to synthesize *p*-aminoacetophenone via a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The student mixes aniline ($C_6H_5NH_2$) with one molar equivalent of acetyl chloride ($CH_3COCl$) and adds a molar excess of the Lewis acid catalyst aluminum trichloride ($AlCl_3$). The student expects the amino group of aniline, being a strong activating ortho, para-director, to facilitate acylation at the para position of the aromatic ring. However, upon completion of the reaction and subsequent aqueous workup, analysis of the reaction mixture shows that the desired *p*-aminoacetophenone is not the major product. Instead, a different organic compound is isolated in high yield.\n\nWhich of the following compounds represents the major organic product of this attempted reaction?\n\nA. *p*-aminoacetophenone\n\nB. *m*-aminoacetophenone\n\nC. Acetanilide\n\nD. The aniline-aluminum trichloride salt, $[C_6H_5NH_2AlCl_3]$", "solution": "Aniline $C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}$ is a strong Lewis base. In the presence of a Lewis acid such as $AlCl_{3}$, the aniline lone pair coordinates immediately, forming a Lewis acid-base complex:\n$$C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} + AlCl_{3} \\to C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}\\!:\\!AlCl_{3}.$$\nThis coordination withdraws electron density from the aniline nitrogen and, by resonance and inductive effects, deactivates the aromatic ring toward electrophilic substitution, effectively converting the strongly activating $-NH_{2}$ group into a deactivating, meta-directing ammonium-like species under the reaction conditions. Therefore, electrophilic aromatic substitution (Friedel-Crafts acylation on the ring) is strongly suppressed.\n\nConcurrently, acetyl chloride is activated by $AlCl_{3}$ to generate a potent acylating species:\n$$CH_{3}COCl + AlCl_{3} \\to CH_{3}CO^{+} + AlCl_{4}^{-}.$$\nIn this mixture, the most nucleophilic site available is the aniline nitrogen, not the deactivated aromatic ring. Thus, the dominant pathway is nucleophilic acyl substitution at nitrogen (N-acylation), yielding the amide (acetanilide) under the Lewis acidic conditions:\n$$C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} + CH_{3}COCl \\xrightarrow[]{AlCl_{3}} C_{6}H_{5}NHCOCH_{3} + HCl.$$\nAny $AlCl_{3}$ complexes of the amide formed during the reaction are broken during the aqueous workup, liberating neutral acetanilide as the isolated organic product. The alternative possibilities are disfavored: para Friedel-Crafts acylation does not occur because the ring is deactivated by coordination to $AlCl_{3}$; meta acylation is also not formed in high yield for the same reason; and the $[C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}AlCl_{3}]$ complex is not the final isolated organic product after aqueous workup and is not a purely organic compound.\n\nTherefore, the major isolated product is acetanilide, corresponding to choice C. This is why, in practice, to perform Friedel-Crafts acylation on an aniline derivative, the amino group is first protected as an amide (e.g., acetanilide), which is less basic yet still ortho/para-directing, and only then is the aromatic acylation carried out, followed by deprotection to regenerate the amine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2194325"}]}
