The biological impact and environmental fate of these acids are known to be highly dependent on their pKa values, as this determines their predominant charge state at the near-neutral pH of natural water systems.

Hence\n$$pK_{a}(\\text{2-methylpropanoic})>pK_{a}(\\text{acetic}).$$\n\n2) Between chloroacetic acid and fluoroacetic acid, fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine and exerts a stronger inductive electron-withdrawing effect, stabilizing the conjugate base more and making fluoroacetic acid the stronger acid.
