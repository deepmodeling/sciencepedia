This first practice uses a thought experiment to explore the fundamental rule governing nucleophilic acyl substitutions: the role of the leaving group. By analyzing a hypothetical reaction between an ester and sodium chloride, you will solidify your understanding of how leaving group ability, which is inversely related to basicity, dictates the energetic favorability and outcome of the entire process [@problem_id:2172664].", "problem": "In a hypothetical experiment, a student attempts to synthesize an acyl chloride from an ester. The student mixes ethyl acetate ($CH_3COOCH_2CH_3$) with a large excess of sodium chloride ($NaCl$) in a suitable aprotic solvent, hoping to form acetyl chloride ($CH_3COCl$) and sodium ethoxide ($NaOCH_2CH_3$). Despite heating the mixture, no significant amount of acetyl chloride is formed.\n\nThe general mechanism for nucleophilic acyl substitution involves the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, which then collapses by expelling a leaving group. The success of the reaction is largely determined by the relative stability of the potential leaving groups. A more stable leaving group is a weaker base.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the best chemical reasoning for why this reaction does not proceed as intended?\n\nA. The chloride ion ($Cl^{-}$) is a much stronger base than the ethoxide ion ($CH_3CH_2O^{-}$), and therefore the chloride ion cannot displace the ethoxide group.\nB. The sodium cation ($Na^{+}$) strongly coordinates to the ethoxide leaving group, preventing it from dissociating from the tetrahedral intermediate.\nC. The ethoxide ion ($CH_3CH_2O^{-}$) is a much stronger base than the chloride ion ($Cl^{-}$), making ethoxide a very poor leaving group compared to chloride.\nD. The ester's carbonyl group is not electrophilic enough to be attacked by a relatively weak nucleophile like the chloride ion; an acid catalyst is required.\nE. The chloride ion is sterically hindered and too large to effectively attack the compact carbonyl carbon of ethyl acetate.", "solution": "We consider the nucleophilic acyl substitution pathway. In the first step, a nucleophile $Cl^{-}$ may attack the carbonyl carbon of the ester $CH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3}$ to give a tetrahedral intermediate:\n$$\nCH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3} + Cl^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{(tetrahedral intermediate)}.\n$$\nThis intermediate can collapse by expelling one of two potential leaving groups: either $Cl^{-}$ or $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$. The direction of collapse is governed by leaving group ability, which is inversely related to basicity: the weaker base is the better leaving group.\n\nTo compare basicities, we use $pK_a$ of the conjugate acids. For $Cl^{-}$, the conjugate acid is $\\mathrm{HCl}$ with $pK_a \\ll 0$, while for $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$, the conjugate acid is ethanol with $pK_a \\approx 16$. Since higher $pK_a$ of the conjugate acid corresponds to a stronger base, we have:\n$$\n\\text{basicity: } CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-} \\gg Cl^{-}.\n$$\nTherefore, $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$ is a much stronger base and thus a much poorer leaving group than $Cl^{-}$. Consequently, when the tetrahedral intermediate collapses, it preferentially expels the better leaving group $Cl^{-}$ rather than $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$. This regenerates the starting ester instead of forming $CH_{3}COCl$:\n$$\n\\text{(tetrahedral intermediate)} \\to CH_{3}COOCH_{2}CH_{3} + Cl^{-}.\n$$\nHence, the equilibrium strongly disfavors substitution of $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$ by $Cl^{-}$, and the attempted conversion of an ester to an acid chloride does not proceed. This directly supports the statement that the ethoxide ion is a much stronger base than chloride, making ethoxide a very poor leaving group compared to chloride.\n\nTherefore, the best reasoning is option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2172664"}, {"introduction": "Building on the core principle of leaving groups, this exercise introduces the concept of chemoselectivity in a molecule with multiple reactive sites. You are challenged to predict which functional group—an ester or a thioester—will react preferentially with a nucleophile. This problem highlights the established reactivity hierarchy among carboxylic acid derivatives, linking it directly back to the relative stabilities and leaving group abilities of alkoxides versus thiolates [@problem_id:2172688].", "problem": "A chemist synthesizes the compound Methyl 4-(ethylthio)-4-oxobutanoate, which possesses both a methyl ester and an S-ethyl thioester functional group. This compound is treated with exactly one molar equivalent of ammonia ($NH_3$) in an inert solvent. The reaction is allowed to proceed to completion. Your task is to predict the major organic product formed.\n\nWhich of the following compounds is the major product of this reaction?\n\nA. Methyl 4-amino-4-oxobutanoate\nB. S-ethyl 4-amino-4-oxobutanoate\nC. Butanediamide\nD. A nearly 1:1 mixture of Methyl 4-amino-4-oxobutanoate and S-ethyl 4-amino-4-oxobutanoate\nE. No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "The substrate is best represented as a four-carbon chain bearing two acyl derivatives: a methyl ester at C1 and an S-ethyl thioester at C4. In condensed form, this is MeOCO–CH2–CH2–C(=O)–SEt. The reaction partner is one equivalent of $NH_3$, a nucleophile that performs nucleophilic acyl substitution on activated acyl derivatives.\n\nPrinciple 1 (relative acyl reactivity): Among common carboxylic acid derivatives, the general order of electrophilicity to nucleophilic acyl substitution is\n$$\n\\text{acyl chloride} > \\text{anhydride} > \\text{thioester} \\gg \\text{ester} > \\text{amide}.\n$$\nTherefore, under identical conditions, $NH_3$ will attack the thioester carbonyl much faster than the methyl ester carbonyl.\n\nMechanistic step 1 (nucleophilic addition): $NH_3$ attacks the thioester carbonyl at C4 to form a tetrahedral intermediate.\n\nMechanistic step 2 (collapse and leaving group departure): The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, expelling $SEt^{-}$ as the leaving group and forming the amide at C4. The immediate product is MeOCO–CH2–CH2–C(=O)–$NH_2$.\n\nMechanistic step 3 (proton transfer): The expelled $SEt^{-}$ is protonated under the reaction conditions, typically by $NH_4^{+}$ generated during the process, to give EtSH. The net stoichiometry for this selective aminolysis is\n$$\n\\mathrm{MeOCO{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}C(=O){-}SEt} + NH_{3} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{MeOCO{-}CH_{2}{-}CH_{2}{-}C(=O){-}NH_{2}} + \\mathrm{EtSH}.\n$$\n\nStoichiometry and selectivity: Because only one molar equivalent of $NH_3$ is present and the thioester reacts much more rapidly than the methyl ester, the ammonia is consumed converting the thioester into an amide, leaving the methyl ester unreacted. Conversion of the methyl ester to an amide would require additional equivalents of $NH_3$ and proceeds much more slowly; formation of the diamide (butanediamide) requires excess $NH_3$ and is not possible with only one equivalent. A nearly 1:1 mixture is not expected due to the strong kinetic preference for aminolysis of the thioester.\n\nTherefore, the major product is the compound in which the C4 thioester is converted to an amide while the C1 methyl ester remains intact. This corresponds to “Methyl 4-amino-4-oxobutanoate,” which denotes an amide functionality at C4 and a methyl ester at C1.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2172688"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores a critical nuance in nucleophilic acyl substitution, particularly in the context of organometallic reagents. The reaction of an ester with a Grignard reagent often leads to a surprising result, as the intermediate product can be more reactive than the starting material.

The student is surprised to find that the reaction yields very little of the desired acetophenone. Instead, a different major organic product is formed, along with a significant amount of unreacted ethyl benzoate.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds to completion with the available Grignard reagent, which of the following compounds is the principal organic product formed from the reaction of the Grignard reagent?\n\nA. Acetophenone\nB. 2-Phenyl-2-propanol\nC. Benzoic acid\nD. Benzyl alcohol\nE. Phenylacetic acid", "solution": "Esters require two equivalents of a Grignard reagent to reach the tertiary alcohol after aqueous workup because the first equivalent forms a ketone, which is more electrophilic than the starting ester and thus reacts preferentially with any remaining Grignard reagent. For ethyl benzoate and methylmagnesium bromide, the elementary steps are:\n\nFirst addition and collapse to the ketone:\n$$\nC_{6}H_{5}COOCH_{2}CH_{3} + CH_{3}MgBr \\to C_{6}H_{5}COCH_{3} + CH_{3}CH_{2}OMgBr\n$$\n\nSecond addition to the ketone (faster than addition to the ester):\n$$\nC_{6}H_{5}COCH_{3} + CH_{3}MgBr \\to C_{6}H_{5}C(OMgBr)(CH_{3})_{2}\n$$\n\nAqueous workup gives the tertiary alcohol:\n$$\nC_{6}H_{5}C(OMgBr)(CH_{3})_{2} + H_{3}O^{+} \\to C_{6}H_{5}C(OH)(CH_{3})_{2}\n$$\n\nLet the initial moles of ester be $n_{E}$ and of Grignard be $n_{G}$. Here $n_{G}=n_{E}$. If $x$ moles of ester undergo the first addition to give $x$ moles of ketone, this consumes $x$ moles of Grignard, leaving $n_{E}-x$ moles of Grignard and $x$ moles of ketone. Because the ketone is more electrophilic, the remaining $n_{E}-x$ moles of Grignard react with ketone until one reagent is depleted. To minimize accumulation of ketone (which is typically not isolated), the system proceeds such that $x=n_{E}/2$, consuming all remaining Grignard with the ketone to give $n_{E}/2$ moles of tertiary alcohol and leaving $n_{E}/2$ moles of unreacted ester. Thus, with one equivalent of Grignard, the principal product formed from the Grignard addition is the tertiary alcohol $C_{6}H_{5}C(OH)(CH_{3})_{2}$, i.e., 2-phenyl-2-propanol.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the tertiary alcohol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2172699"}]}
