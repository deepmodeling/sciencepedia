Propanamide is the amide derived from propanoic acid: $\\text{CH}_{3}-\\text{CH}_{2}-\\text{C}(= \\text{O})-\\text{NH}_{2}$.

According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, a carboxylic acid has higher priority than an ester. Therefore, the carboxyl group is the principal functional group, and the compound will be named as a carboxylic acid.\n\nStep 2: Identify the parent structure.\nThe principal functional group is attached to a naphthalene ring system. When a carboxyl group is attached directly to a cyclic structure, the parent name is formed by appending the suffix \"-carboxylic acid\" to the name of the ring system. The carboxyl group is located at the C1 position of the naphthalene ring. The standard numbering of naphthalene starts at one of the carbons adjacent to the ring fusion (an alpha-carbon), proceeds around the first ring (positions 1-4), passes the fusion carbons (4a, 8a), and continues around the second ring (positions 5-8). Thus, the parent name of the compound is naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid.\n\nStep 3: Identify and name the substituent.\nThe other functional group, the methoxycarbonyl group ($-\\text{COOCH}_3$), is treated as a substituent. The IUPAC-preferred name for this substituent is \"methoxycarbonyl\". It is located at the C5 position of the naphthalene ring.\n\nStep 4: Assemble the complete IUPAC name.\nThe substituent name is placed as a prefix to the parent name, preceded by its locant. The complete name is constructed as follows: (locant)-(substituent name)(parent name). This gives 5-(methoxycarbonyl)naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid. Parentheses are used around \"methoxycarbonyl\" to clarify that the '5-' locant applies to the entire complex substituent.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the given options.\nA. 5-(Methoxycarbonyl)naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid: This name correctly identifies the carboxylic acid as the principal functional group, uses the correct parent name (naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid), and correctly names and locates the methoxycarbonyl substituent. This is the correct IUPAC name.\n\nB. Methyl 1-carboxynaphthalene-5-carboxylate: This name incorrectly treats the ester as the principal functional group and the carboxylic acid as a substituent (\"carboxy\"). This violates the priority rules.\n\nC. 4-(Methoxycarbonyl)naphthalene-8-carboxylic acid: This name uses an incorrect numbering scheme for the naphthalene ring. The alpha positions are 1, 4, 5, and 8. The groups are specified to be at C1 and C5.\n\nD. 1-Carboxy-5-(methoxycarbonyl)naphthalene: This name improperly treats both functional groups as substituents on a naphthalene parent. The principal functional group must be indicated by a suffix.\n\nE. 5-Carbomethoxynaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid: This name uses \"carbomethoxy\" as the substituent name. While this name is sometimes used colloquially or in older literature, \"methoxycarbonyl\" is the preferred and systematically correct IUPAC term.
