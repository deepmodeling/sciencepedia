This exercise investigates the saponification of an ester with a stereocenter adjacent to the carbonyl group, prompting you to determine if the reaction proceeds with retention, inversion, or racemization. Answering this question requires a precise understanding of the nucleophilic acyl substitution mechanism and an awareness of potential side reactions like enolization. [@problem_id:2176668]", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis aimed at producing a chiral carboxylic acid, an organic chemistry student starts with an enantiomerically pure sample of methyl (S)-2-phenylpropanoate. The student subjects this ester to saponification by heating it with a stoichiometric amount of aqueous sodium hydroxide. After the reaction is complete, the mixture is cooled and then acidified with aqueous hydrochloric acid to isolate the final product.

Exclusively (R)-2-phenylpropanoic acid.\nB. Exclusively (S)-2-phenylpropanoic acid.\nC. A racemic (1:1) mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-phenylpropanoic acid.\nD. A non-racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-phenylpropanoic acid, enriched in the (S)-enantiomer.", "solution": "The starting material is methyl (S)-2-phenylpropanoate, whose sole stereocenter is the benzylic, alpha carbon adjacent to the ester carbonyl. Under basic saponification, hydroxide promotes nucleophilic acyl substitution at the carbonyl carbon of the ester, not at the stereocenter.\n\nMechanistic steps:\n1) Nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on the ester carbonyl produces a tetrahedral intermediate. This step involves bond formation at the carbonyl carbon; the alpha stereocenter is not involved in bond making or breaking.\n2) Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate expels methoxide and generates the carboxylic acid, which under the basic conditions is immediately present as its carboxylate anion.\n3) Upon acidification with aqueous hydrochloric acid, the carboxylate is protonated to give the free carboxylic acid. Protonation at oxygen does not affect the carbon stereocenter.\n\nThus, if no configurational change occurs at the alpha carbon, the configuration is retained from (S) ester to (S) acid.\n\nPotential racemization pathway and its relevance:\n- Racemization would require formation of a planar enolate at the alpha carbon, followed by reprotonation from either face. This requires deprotonation of the alpha hydrogen by base. The equilibrium for enolate formation from an ester in aqueous hydroxide is strongly unfavorable because the alpha $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of an ester is much larger than the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of water. Writing the equilibrium constant symbolically,\n$$\nK_{\\text{deprot}} \\approx 10^{-\\left(\\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\alpha}(\\text{ester})-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\\right)} \\ll 1,\n$$\nso the steady-state concentration of enolate is negligible under standard saponification conditions. Consequently, nucleophilic acyl substitution at the carbonyl proceeds to completion far faster than any enolization-driven racemization.\n- The final acidification step is a simple protonation at oxygen and does not involve enolization or carbocation formation under the stated conditions.\n\nTherefore, the stereocenter remains intact, and the product is enantiomerically pure 2-phenylpropanoic acid with the same absolute configuration as the starting ester, namely the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nHence, the best choice is exclusively (S)-2-phenylpropanoic acid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2176668"}, {"introduction": "The overall rate of a chemical reaction can sometimes be the sum of multiple competing pathways. This problem explores a fascinating case where two stereoisomers react at vastly different speeds due to the availability of a unique intramolecular pathway for only one of them.
