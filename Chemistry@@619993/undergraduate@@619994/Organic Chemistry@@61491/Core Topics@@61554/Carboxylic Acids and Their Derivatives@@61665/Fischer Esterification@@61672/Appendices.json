This problem [@problem_id:2170307] challenges you to think critically about the reaction mechanism by considering a hypothetical scenario where the necessary acid catalyst is mistakenly replaced with a strong base. Analyzing the outcome will illuminate the fundamental role of the acid in activating the carboxylic acid, making the carbonyl carbon a better electrophile for the alcohol to attack.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is attempting to synthesize ethyl acetate from acetic acid and ethanol. The standard procedure for this Fischer esterification calls for a catalytic amount of a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid. However, the student mistakenly adds one molar equivalent of sodium hydroxide ($\\text{NaOH}$), a strong base, to the reaction mixture instead. Upon heating the mixture, the student observes that no significant amount of the desired ethyl acetate product is formed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary chemical reason for this failure?\n\nA. The sodium hydroxide deprotonates the ethanol to form sodium ethoxide, a powerful nucleophile that is too sterically hindered to attack the acetic acid.\n\nB. The sodium hydroxide deprotonates the acetic acid to form sodium acetate. The resulting acetate anion is a poor electrophile because its negative charge is delocalized, rendering the carbonyl carbon resistant to nucleophilic attack by ethanol.\n\nC. The sodium hydroxide acts as a catalyst for the reverse reaction, rapidly hydrolyzing any ethyl acetate that is formed back into acetic acid and ethanol.\n\nD. The sodium hydroxide promotes an E2 elimination reaction on the ethanol, converting it to ethene, which then escapes from the reaction mixture as a gas.\n\nE. The hydroxide ion acts as a stronger nucleophile than ethanol, and it preferentially attacks the carbonyl carbon of acetic acid, leading to a stable, unreactive tetrahedral intermediate.", "solution": "Identify the role of acid in Fischer esterification. In the standard mechanism, the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid is protonated, which increases the electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon, enabling nucleophilic attack by the alcohol. In symbolic terms, acid catalysis generates an activated acylium-like species that facilitates formation and collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate to give the ester and water. Without this protonation, the carbonyl is insufficiently electrophilic and the leaving group is not activated.\n\nAccount for the effect of adding one equivalent of a strong base. Sodium hydroxide quantitatively deprotonates the carboxylic acid:\n$$\n\\text{RCO}_2\\text{H} + \\text{OH}^- \\to \\text{RCO}_2^- + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant for this acid–base reaction can be expressed in terms of $pK_a$ values by\n$$\nK = 10^{pK_a(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) - pK_a(\\text{RCO}_2\\text{H})}\n$$\nand since $pK_a(\\text{RCO}_2\\text{H}) \\ll pK_a(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$, it follows that $K \\gg 1$. With one molar equivalent of $\\text{OH}^-$, essentially all $\\text{RCO}_2\\text{H}$ is converted to $\\text{RCO}_2^-$, eliminating the required proton source and the protonated carbonyl intermediate.\n\nAnalyze the reactivity of the resulting carboxylate. The carboxylate anion $\\text{RCO}_2^-$ has its negative charge delocalized over both oxygens via resonance. This delocalization reduces the partial positive character at the carbonyl carbon, making it a poor electrophile. Consequently, nucleophilic attack by ethanol is disfavored. Furthermore, in basic medium the putative tetrahedral intermediate would be anionic and its collapse would not generate a good leaving group; expulsion of $\\text{OH}^-$ is highly unfavorable in base. Thus, ester formation from a carboxylate and a neutral alcohol does not proceed under these conditions.\n\nEvaluate the provided options:\n- A is incorrect because while bases can generate some alkoxide, the principal issue is not steric hindrance of the nucleophile; moreover, the dominant event is deprotonation of the acid to the unreactive carboxylate.\n- B is correct: deprotonation to the resonance-stabilized carboxylate removes electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon and prevents the necessary acid activation.\n- C is not the primary reason. Although base-catalyzed hydrolysis (saponification) of esters is possible, essentially no ester forms in the first place because the substrate is converted to carboxylate and the reaction lacks acid activation.\n- D is incorrect; $\\text{OH}^-$ does not promote E2 elimination on ethanol to give ethene under these conditions.\n- E is incorrect; $\\text{OH}^-$ attacking a carboxylic acid would first undergo proton transfer, and formation of a “stable, unreactive tetrahedral intermediate” is not the operative explanation; the key problem is the absence of an electrophilic acyl species.\n\nTherefore, the primary chemical reason is that base converts the carboxylic acid into a resonance-stabilized carboxylate anion, which is a poor electrophile and cannot undergo Fischer esterification with ethanol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2170307"}, {"introduction": "Organic synthesis often involves molecules with multiple functional groups, presenting the challenge of selectively targeting just one.

This reaction is a Fischer esterification.\n\nFirst, let's identify the structure of the starting material, 3-methylbutane-1,3-diol. The butane chain has four carbons. There are hydroxyl (-OH) groups at positions 1 and 3, and a methyl (-CH3) group at position 3. The structure is:\n$\\text{HO-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-C(OH)(CH}_3\\text{)CH}_3$\n\nWe can classify the two alcohol functional groups:\n1.  The hydroxyl group at position 1 is attached to a carbon that is bonded to only one other carbon atom. This is a primary ($1^\\circ$) alcohol.\n2.  The hydroxyl group at position 3 is attached to a carbon that is bonded to three other carbon atoms. This is a tertiary ($3^\\circ$) alcohol.\n\nThe reaction is a Fischer esterification, which involves the nucleophilic attack of an alcohol on a protonated carboxylic acid. The overall reaction for an alcohol (R-OH) and a carboxylic acid (R'-COOH) is:\n$\\text{R-OH} + \\text{R'-COOH} \\xrightarrow{H^+} \\text{R'-COO-R} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n\nSince we are using only one equivalent of acetic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}$), the reaction will predominantly form a mono-ester. The question is one of regioselectivity: which of the two hydroxyl groups, the primary or the tertiary, will react preferentially?\n\nThe mechanism of Fischer esterification involves several steps, but the key step that determines the rate for sterically different alcohols is the nucleophilic attack of the alcohol's oxygen atom on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the protonated carboxylic acid. The rate of this step is highly dependent on steric hindrance.\n\nLet's compare the steric environment of the two hydroxyl groups:\n-   The primary alcohol at C1 is sterically unhindered. Its oxygen atom can easily access the electrophilic center of the protonated acetic acid.\n-   The tertiary alcohol at C3 is sterically crowded. The carbon atom it's attached to is tertiary (bonded to three other carbon atoms). This significant steric bulk makes it difficult for the tertiary oxygen atom to approach and attack the carbonyl carbon.\n\nDue to this difference in steric hindrance, the nucleophilic attack by the primary alcohol is kinetically favored and occurs at a much faster rate than the attack by the tertiary alcohol. Therefore, the major product will be the one where the primary alcohol has been converted to an ester.\n\nThe esterification of the primary hydroxyl group involves replacing its hydrogen with an acetyl group ($\\text{-COCH}_3$) from acetic acid.\nReactant: $\\text{HO-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-C(OH)(CH}_3\\text{)CH}_3$\nAcid: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{COOH}$\nProduct: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO-CH}_2\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-C(OH)(CH}_3\\text{)CH}_3$\n\nNow, we must name this product to match it with the given options. The parent structure is an acetate ester. The alcohol-derived part is a '3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl' group. Therefore, the IUPAC name for the major product is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl acetate.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\nA. 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl acetate: This is the product formed from the esterification of the primary alcohol. This matches our prediction.\nB. 1-hydroxy-3-methylbutan-3-yl acetate: This would be the product from the esterification of the tertiary alcohol. This is the minor product due to steric hindrance.\nC. 3-methylbutane-1,3-diyl diacetate: This would be the product if two or more equivalents of acetic acid were used, esterifying both alcohol groups.\nD. 3-methylbut-3-en-1-ol: This is an alkene-alcohol that would result from the acid-catalyzed dehydration (elimination of water) of the tertiary alcohol. While this is a possible side reaction, Fischer esterification conditions are optimized for ester formation, and it is less likely to be the major product compared to the kinetically favored esterification at the primary site.\nE. 4,4-dimethyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-ol: This is a cyclic hemiacetal, which might form under different conditions or from a different starting material, but it is not the expected product of an intermolecular esterification with acetic acid.\n\nBased on the kinetic preference for the reaction at the sterically less hindered primary alcohol, the major product is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl acetate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2170329"}]}
