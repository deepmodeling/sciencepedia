The reagent is methylmagnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent, used in excess, in an ether solvent, followed by an aqueous acid workup with dilute HCl.\n\nKey reactivity principles:\n1) Grignard reagents act as carbon nucleophiles that add to carbonyl groups. For esters, the first addition gives a tetrahedral intermediate that collapses with loss of alkoxide to form a ketone. Because ketones are more electrophilic than esters, a second equivalent of the Grignard reagent adds to the ketone, yielding a tertiary alkoxide. Aqueous acid workup then protonates the alkoxide to give a tertiary alcohol.\n2) Overall, an ester $R^{1}COOR^{2}$ treated with $2$ equivalents of $RMgX$, then $H_{3}O^{+}$, furnishes $R^{1}C(OH)(R)_{2}$, a tertiary alcohol bearing two $R$ groups from the Grignard reagent and the $R^{1}$ group from the acyl portion of the ester.\n\nApplying this to the present case:\n- The ester is $ArCOOMe$ with $Ar$ being the $4$-methoxyphenyl group.\n- The Grignard reagent is $MeMgBr$.\n- First addition and collapse yield the aryl methyl ketone (4-methoxyacetophenone) as an intermediate.\n- Because the reagent is in excess, a second $Me$ adds to the ketone to form the tertiary alkoxide $ArC(OMgBr)(Me)_{2}$.\n- Acid workup ($H_{3}O^{+}$) converts the alkoxide to the tertiary alcohol $ArC(OH)(Me)_{2}$.\n\nIn compact form:\n$$ArCOOMe + 2\\,MeMgBr \\xrightarrow{\\text{ether}} ArC(OMgBr)(Me)_{2} \\xrightarrow{H_{3}O^{+}} ArC(OH)(Me)_{2}$$\nwith $Ar = \\text{4-methoxyphenyl}$. The product is therefore 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-ol.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A (4-methoxyacetophenone) would be the intermediate from one equivalent, but with excess Grignard it is further converted to the tertiary alcohol.\n- B (1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol) would arise from addition to an aldehyde, not an ester.\n- C (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-ol) matches the expected tertiary alcohol from two additions to the ester.\n- D (4-methoxybenzoic acid) would result from hydrolysis of the ester, which does not occur under Grignard reaction conditions; moreover, acid would quench the Grignard reagent.\n- E (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol) would require demethylation of the anisole ether, which does not occur under these conditions.\n\nThus, the major product is 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2194064"}, {"introduction": "Building on the standard reaction, this problem introduces a critical nuance: what happens when the Grignard reagent is the limiting reactant?

The reagent is methylmagnesium iodide, $CH_{3}MgI$, a strong nucleophile and base.\n\nKey reactivity principle: Grignard reagents add to esters via nucleophilic acyl substitution to give a ketone, which, being more electrophilic than the starting ester, undergoes a second, faster nucleophilic addition by the Grignard reagent to form a tertiary alkoxide. Acidic workup then protonates the alkoxide to give the tertiary alcohol.\n\nStep 1 (first addition to the ester, nucleophilic acyl substitution):\nFor a general ester $R^{1}C(=O)OR^{2}$ and a Grignard reagent $R^{3}MgX$,\n$$\nR^{1}C(=O)OR^{2} + R^{3}MgX \\rightarrow R^{1}C(OMgX)(R^{3})OR^{2} \\rightarrow R^{1}C(=O)R^{3} + R^{2}OMgX.\n$$\nApplying $R^{1} = \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}$, $R^{2} = \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}$, and $R^{3} = \\text{CH}_{3}$ gives the ketone $CH_{3}CH_{2}C(=O)CH_{3}$ (butan-2-one) and magnesium ethoxide.\n\nStep 2 (second addition to the ketone, nucleophilic addition):\nFor the ketone $R^{1}C(=O)R^{3}$,\n$$\nR^{1}C(=O)R^{3} + R^{3}MgX \\rightarrow R^{1}C(OMgX)(R^{3})_{2}.\n$$\nAfter aqueous quench (saturated $NH_{4}Cl$),\n$$\nR^{1}C(OMgX)(R^{3})_{2} \\xrightarrow{\\text{workup}} R^{1}C(OH)(R^{3})_{2}.\n$$\nWith $R^{1} = \\text{CH}_{3}\\text{CH}_{2}$ and $R^{3} = \\text{CH}_{3}$, the product is $(CH_{3})_{2}C(OH)CH_{2}CH_{3}$, which is 2-methylbutan-2-ol.\n\nStoichiometric and kinetic rationale with one equivalent of $CH_{3}MgI$:\n- Overall, converting one mole of ester to the tertiary alcohol requires two moles of Grignard reagent. With only one equivalent of $CH_{3}MgI$, at most half of the ester can be driven all the way to the tertiary alcohol.\n- However, the ketone intermediate is more electrophilic than the starting ester; thus $CH_{3}MgI$ reacts with the ketone faster than with the ester. As soon as ketone is formed, the remaining Grignard reagent preferentially adds to it, channeling consumption toward the second addition rather than further first additions.\n- Consequently, under the given conditions, the major organic product formed from the transformation of the ester upon quench is the tertiary alcohol, 2-methylbutan-2-ol.\n\nElimination by options:\n- A (butan-2-one) is the ephemeral intermediate and is not the major product because ketones react faster than esters with Grignard reagents.\n- C (propanoic acid) would require hydrolysis/oxidation not present under these conditions.\n- D (ethanol) arises from protonation of the ethoxide leaving group, but it is not the principal carbon framework product of the acyl portion.\n- E (propan-1-ol) is not formed in this reaction pathway.\n\nTherefore, the expected major organic product is 2-methylbutan-2-ol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2194042"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the forward reaction, let's now approach the challenge from a synthetic chemist's perspective by working backward from a desired product.
