This reaction is typically carried out using a strong oxidizing agent, such as a hot, acidic solution of potassium permanganate or chromic acid. A key requirement for this reaction to proceed is the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon—the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. If no benzylic hydrogens are present, the alkyl group is resistant to oxidation under these conditions.\n\nAn unknown alkylbenzene with the molecular formula $C_{10}H_{14}$ is subjected to vigorous oxidation with hot chromic acid.

Any alkylbenzene with at least one benzylic hydrogen is converted to the corresponding benzoic acid derivative; if the benzylic carbon bears no hydrogens (i.e., is quaternary), the side chain is resistant to oxidation and the compound is recovered unchanged.\n\nThe unknown has formula $C_{10}H_{14}$. For a monosubstituted benzene, this corresponds to $C_{6}H_{5}$ plus an alkyl group $C_{4}H_{9}$, which is consistent with all butylbenzene isomers, including tert-butylbenzene. It is also consistent with 1,4-diethylbenzene, which corresponds to $C_{6}H_{4}$ plus two $C_{2}H_{5}$ groups.\n\nEvaluate each option for the presence or absence of benzylic hydrogens:\n- In $n$-butylbenzene (option A), the benzylic carbon is a $CH_{2}$ group ($\\text{Ph-}CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{3}$), which has benzylic hydrogens; it would be oxidized to benzoic acid.\n- In $sec$-butylbenzene (option B), the benzylic carbon is $CH$ ($\\text{Ph-}CH(CH_{3})CH_{2}CH_{3}$), which has one benzylic hydrogen; it would be oxidized.\n- In isobutylbenzene (option C), the benzylic carbon is $CH_{2}$ ($\\text{Ph-}CH_{2}CH(CH_{3})_{2}$); it would be oxidized.\n- In tert-butylbenzene (option D), the benzylic carbon is quaternary, $C(\\text{Ph})(CH_{3})_{3}$, with zero benzylic hydrogens; it resists oxidation and would be recovered unchanged. Its formula is $C_{6}H_{5}+C_{4}H_{9}=C_{10}H_{14}$, matching the unknown.\n- In 1,4-diethylbenzene (option E), each benzylic carbon is $CH_{2}$, so benzylic hydrogens are present; under vigorous oxidation, both side chains convert to carboxyl groups, giving terephthalic acid, not unchanged starting material.\n\nTherefore, the only structure consistent with being recovered unchanged under hot chromic acid is tert-butylbenzene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2191555"}, {"introduction": "Beyond oxidation reactions, new carbon-carbon bonds can be formed to construct carboxylic acids.

Cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of propan-2-one (acetone), forming an alkoxide intermediate. Protonation of the alkoxide gives the cyanohydrin. Starting from acetone, this yields the tertiary cyanohydrin with the structure $(CH_3)_2C(OH)CN$. The IUPAC name of this intermediate is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile.\n\nStep 2 (acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile): Under strong aqueous acid and heat, the nitrile group hydrolyzes via the amide to the carboxylic acid. The carbon of the nitrile becomes the carboxyl carbon, and the C−C bond between the former carbonyl carbon and the nitrile carbon remains intact. Therefore, the product has the structure $(CH_3)_2C(OH)COOH$. For IUPAC naming, choose the parent chain as propanoic acid, numbering from the carboxyl carbon. Both the hydroxy and methyl substituents are located at carbon 2.
