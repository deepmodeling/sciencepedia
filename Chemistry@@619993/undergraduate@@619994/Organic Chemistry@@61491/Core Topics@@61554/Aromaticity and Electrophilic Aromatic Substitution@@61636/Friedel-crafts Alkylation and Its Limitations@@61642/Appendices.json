Neither reaction is effective; the starting materials are recovered largely unreacted.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the major product of two different Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions on benzene. The outcome of these reactions is determined by the electrophile that attacks the benzene ring. In Friedel-Crafts alkylations, the electrophile is a carbocation, and its structure is subject to rearrangement to form a more stable species. The stability of simple alkyl carbocations follows the order: tertiary > secondary > primary.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 1: Benzene + 1-chloropropane + $AlCl_3$**\n\nFirst, the Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum trichloride ($AlCl_3$), interacts with 1-chloropropane to generate an electrophile. This interaction pulls the chloride away from the alkyl chain, generating a primary carbocation, the n-propyl carbocation ($CH_3CH_2CH_2^+$), and the tetrachloroaluminate anion ($AlCl_4^-$).\n$$CH_3CH_2CH_2Cl + AlCl_3 \\rightleftharpoons CH_3CH_2CH_2^+ + AlCl_4^-$$\nThe n-propyl carbocation is a primary ($1^{\\circ}$) carbocation. Primary carbocations are relatively unstable and are prone to rearrangement if a more stable carbocation can be formed. In this case, a 1,2-hydride shift can occur. A hydrogen atom from the central carbon (C-2) migrates with its electron pair to the terminal, positively charged carbon (C-1).\n$$CH_3-CH(H)-CH_2^+ \\longrightarrow CH_3-CH^+-CH_3$$\nThis rearrangement converts the unstable primary n-propyl carbocation into the more stable secondary ($2^{\\circ}$) isopropyl carbocation. Because this rearrangement is rapid and leads to a significant increase in stability, the electrophile that predominantly attacks the benzene ring is the isopropyl carbocation, not the initially formed n-propyl carbocation.\n\nThe subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction between benzene and the isopropyl carbocation yields isopropylbenzene as the major product.\n$$C_6H_6 + CH_3-CH^+-CH_3 \\longrightarrow C_6H_5CH(CH_3)_2 + H^+$$\n\nTherefore, the major product of Reaction 1 is isopropylbenzene.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction 2: Benzene + 2-chloropropane + $AlCl_3$**\n\nIn this reaction, the catalyst $AlCl_3$ abstracts the chloride from 2-chloropropane. This directly generates a secondary carbocation, the isopropyl carbocation ($CH_3CH^+CH_3$).\n$$CH_3CH(Cl)CH_3 + AlCl_3 \\rightleftharpoons CH_3CH^+CH_3 + AlCl_4^-$$\nThe isopropyl carbocation is a secondary ($2^{\\circ}$) carbocation. We must consider if any rearrangement could lead to a more stable carbocation. A 1,2-hydride shift from the secondary carbon to an adjacent primary carbon is not possible. A hydride shift from a primary carbon to the secondary carbon would generate a primary carbocation ($CH_3CH_2CH_2^+$), which is less stable. Since there is no possibility of forming a more stable carbocation (such as a tertiary carbocation) via a simple shift, the isopropyl carbocation does not rearrange.\n\nThis stable secondary carbocation acts as the electrophile and attacks the benzene ring, leading to the formation of isopropylbenzene.\n$$C_6H_6 + CH_3-CH^+-CH_3 \\longrightarrow C_6H_5CH(CH_3)_2 + H^+$$\n\nTherefore, the major product of Reaction 2 is also isopropylbenzene.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of carbocation stability and rearrangement, both Reaction 1 (starting with 1-chloropropane) and Reaction 2 (starting with 2-chloropropane) will yield isopropylbenzene as the major organic product.

This exercise [@problem_id:2172428] challenges you to think in three dimensions by considering the reaction of an optically pure starting material. You will apply your knowledge of the planar, achiral nature of carbocations to predict the optical activity of the product, a key skill for designing stereoselective syntheses.", "problem": "A student performs a Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction by treating an excess of benzene with optically pure (R)-2-butanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of concentrated sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$).

It will be an optically pure sample of (R)-2-phenylbutane.\n\nB. It will be an optically pure sample of (S)-2-phenylbutane.\n\nC. It will be a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-phenylbutane, which is optically inactive.\n\nD. It will be an unequal mixture of (R)- and (S)-2-phenylbutane, resulting in a product that is optically active but not optically pure.\n\nE. The main product will be 1-phenylbutane due to carbocation rearrangement, which is achiral.", "solution": "We consider the mechanistic pathway for alkylation of benzene using an alcohol under strongly acidic conditions. The relevant principles are:\n\n- Under catalytic concentrated sulfuric acid, a secondary alcohol is protonated to form an oxonium ion; loss of water generates a secondary carbocation. This is an SN1/E1-type ionization step that produces a carbocation intermediate.\n- A planar, trigonal carbocation is achiral at the cationic center. Formation of such an intermediate erases the stereochemical information originally present at that center.\n- In electrophilic aromatic substitution with a carbocation electrophile, benzene attacks the carbocation to give a sigma complex, and subsequent deprotonation restores aromaticity. Attack on a planar carbocation occurs with equal probability from either face in an achiral environment, yielding enantiomeric products in equal amounts.\n\nApply these to the specific case:\n\n1) Starting from optically pure (R)-2-butanol, protonation of the hydroxyl group by sulfuric acid gives a protonated alcohol. Departure of water forms the 2-butyl carbocation at C2. This carbocation is secondary and has a planar, trigonal geometry at the cationic carbon, rendering the intermediate achiral and removing any “memory” of the original configuration at C2.\n\n2) Benzene then attacks the carbocation. Because the cationic center is planar and the reaction medium is achiral, attack from either face is equally likely. Formation of the Wheland intermediate (sigma complex) followed by deprotonation gives 2-phenylbutane.\n\n3) The two possible approaches (from the two faces of the planar carbocation) produce the two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-2-phenylbutane, in equal amounts. Therefore, the isolated product is a racemic mixture, which is optically inactive.\n\n4) Competing rearrangements that would lead to 1-phenylbutane would require formation of a less stable primary carbocation via hydride shift, which is disfavored; no more stable tertiary carbocation is accessible. Thus, 2-phenylbutane remains the primary product.\n\nTherefore, the expected stereochemical nature of the 2-phenylbutane product is a racemic mixture of enantiomers, which is optically inactive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2172428"}, {"introduction": "Friedel-Crafts alkylation is often reversible, a feature that becomes particularly prominent under conditions that favor thermodynamic equilibrium.

This equilibrium is driven to the right by two thermodynamic factors:\n- Enthalpic relief: removing three bulky tert-butyl groups from a single ring relieves severe steric crowding; distributing them over separate benzene molecules lowers steric strain, decreasing $\\Delta H$.\n- Mass-action with a large benzene excess: the activity of benzene is effectively constant and very large, so Le Châtelier’s principle favors capture of any released $\\text{tBu}^{+}$ by benzene to form tert-butylbenzene, pulling the dealkylation equilibrium to the right.\n\nCompeting pathways are disfavored:\n- Isomerization to 1,2,4-tri-tert-butylbenzene increases ortho crowding and is not the thermodynamic minimum; moreover, continued transalkylation with benzene will outcompete retention of three tert-butyl groups on a single ring.\n- Electrophilic aromatic sulfonation to give a tri-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid would require attack at positions that are each flanked by two tert-butyl groups, imposing prohibitive steric barriers, and is further suppressed by the huge benzene dilution and only catalytic acid present.\n- Partial dealkylation to a di-tert-butylbenzene is not the thermodynamic endpoint under these conditions; with continued acid catalysis and overwhelming benzene, further transalkylation proceeds to favor monofunctionalization of many benzene molecules rather than multiple tert-butyl groups on one ring.\n\nTherefore, at thermodynamic equilibrium, the major organic components derived from the starting material are benzene (the dealkylated ring) and tert-butylbenzene (formed by trapping of the tert-butyl cation by the solvent). This corresponds to a transalkylation outcome, matching the description that the primary components (besides the large excess of benzene solvent already present) are benzene and tert-butylbenzene.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the statement identifying benzene and tert-butylbenzene as the primary components formed via transalkylation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2172449"}]}
