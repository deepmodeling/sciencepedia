In the first step, an unknown aromatic hydrocarbon, Compound X, is treated with ethanoyl chloride ($CH_{3}COCl$) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride ($AlCl_{3}$). The resulting product is then subjected to a Clemmensen reduction using zinc amalgam ($Zn(Hg)$) and concentrated hydrochloric acid ($HCl$). The sole organic product isolated from this reaction sequence is unequivocally identified as ethylbenzene ($C_{6}H_{5}CH_{2}CH_{3}$).\n\nBased on this information, identify the starting aromatic hydrocarbon, Compound X.\n\nA.

Toluene ($C_6H_5CH_3$):** The methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) is an activating, ortho, para-director. Friedel-Crafts acylation of toluene would produce a mixture of *o*-methylacetophenone and *p*-methylacetophenone. Subsequent Clemmensen reduction would yield a mixture of *o*-ethyltoluene and *p*-ethyltoluene, not solely ethylbenzene.\n-   **C. Naphthalene ($C_{10}H_8$):** Friedel-Crafts acylation of naphthalene would produce acetylnaphthalene. Reduction of this product would yield ethylnaphthalene, which has a different molecular formula and structure from ethylbenzene.\n-   **D. Phenol ($C_6H_5OH$):** The hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$) is strongly activating. However, it contains lone pairs of electrons that complex strongly with the Lewis acid catalyst ($AlCl_3$), deactivating the ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally unsuccessful with phenols.\n-   **E. Nitrobenzene ($C_6H_5NO_2$):** The nitro group ($-\\text{NO}_2$) is a powerful deactivating group. It makes the aromatic ring so electron-poor that Friedel-Crafts reactions (both acylation and alkylation) do not occur.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only starting material that leads to ethylbenzene as the sole product is benzene.
