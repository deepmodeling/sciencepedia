Only Compound A will form a benzyne intermediate.\nB. Only Compound B will form a benzyne intermediate.\nC. Both Compound A and Compound B will form a benzyne intermediate.\nD. Neither Compound A nor Compound B will form a benzyne intermediate.\n\n", "solution": "The formation of a benzyne intermediate from an aryl halide using a strong base like sodium amide ($NaNH_2$) proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism. The first step, which is the key elimination step, requires the base to abstract a proton from a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon atom bearing the halogen leaving group. If there is no proton available at either of the two ortho positions, this initial deprotonation cannot occur, and the benzyne intermediate will not form.\n\nLet's analyze each compound based on this requirement.\n\n**Analysis of Compound A (2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene):**\n1.  **Identify the leaving group and its position:** The leaving group is the bromine atom, which is located at position C2 of the benzene ring. The methyl groups are at C1 and C3.\n2.  **Identify the ortho positions:** The positions ortho to C2 are C1 and C3.\n3.  **Check for ortho hydrogens:** At position C1, there is a methyl group, not a hydrogen atom. At position C3, there is also a methyl group, not a hydrogen atom.\n4.  **Conclusion for Compound A:** Since there are no hydrogen atoms on the carbons ortho to the bromine leaving group, the strong base ($NaNH_2$) cannot perform the initial deprotonation step required for the elimination. Therefore, Compound A will not form a benzyne intermediate under these conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Compound B (4-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene):**\n1.  **Identify the leaving group and its position:** The leaving group is the bromine atom, located at position C4 of the benzene ring. The methyl groups are at C1 and C3.\n2.  **Identify the ortho positions:** The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5.\n3.  **Check for ortho hydrogens:** At position C3, there is a methyl group, so there is no hydrogen available for abstraction. However, position C5 is unsubstituted and therefore has a hydrogen atom attached to it.\n4.  **Conclusion for Compound B:** Since there is a hydrogen atom at the C5 position (which is ortho to the bromine at C4), the amide anion ($NH_2^-$) can abstract this proton. This forms a carbanion at C5. This carbanion then triggers the elimination of the bromide ion from C4, resulting in the formation of a triple bond between C4 and C5. This creates the benzyne intermediate, specifically 3,5-dimethylbenzyne.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nBased on the mechanistic requirement for an available ortho-proton, only Compound B can successfully form a benzyne intermediate. Compound A lacks the necessary ortho-protons for the initial elimination step. Therefore, the correct statement is that only Compound B will form a benzyne intermediate.

This reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that occurs via a benzyne mechanism.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps of the benzyne mechanism for bromobenzene.\n\n**Step 1: Elimination**\nThe reaction is initiated by the strong base, amide anion ($NH_2^-$), abstracting a proton from one of the positions *ortho* to the bromine atom. This is an acid-base reaction. The resulting phenyl anion is unstable and rapidly eliminates the bromide ion ($Br^-$) to form a neutral but highly strained intermediate called benzyne.\n\n$$\n\\text{Bromobenzene} \\xrightarrow[{-HBr}]{\\text{NaNH}_2} \\text{Benzyne}\n$$\n\nThis elimination step can be broken down into two parts:\n1a. Deprotonation: The amide anion removes an ortho-proton.\n$$\nC_6H_5Br + NH_2^- \\rightleftharpoons [C_6H_4Br]^- + NH_3\n$$\n1b. Elimination of halide: The aryl anion eliminates bromide.\n$$\n[C_6H_4Br]^- \\rightarrow C_6H_4 (\\text{benzyne}) + Br^-\n$$\n\nThe first part, the deprotonation (1a), is the slow, rate-determining step of the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Addition**\nThe benzyne intermediate is a powerful electrophile and is rapidly attacked by a nucleophile present in the mixture, which is another amide anion. This addition is followed by protonation by the solvent (ammonia) to yield the final product, aniline.\n\n$$\n\\text{Benzyne} \\xrightarrow[2. \\text{ protonation}]{\\text{1. } NH_2^-} \\text{Aniline}\n$$\n\n**Applying the Mechanism to the Isotope Effect**\nThe key to understanding the rate difference lies in the rate-determining step (RDS). As established, the RDS is the initial deprotonation at the ortho position. For bromobenzene (Compound I), this step involves the cleavage of a C-H bond. For 1-bromo-2,6-dideuteriobenzene (Compound II), the only substitutents at the ortho positions are deuterium atoms. Therefore, for Compound II to react, the amide base must abstract a deuteron, which involves the cleavage of a C-D bond.\n\nThis situation is a classic example of a primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE). The KIE arises because a bond to a heavier isotope (deuterium, D) is stronger than a bond to a lighter isotope (protium, H). The zero-point vibrational energy of a C-D bond is lower than that of a C-H bond. Consequently, more energy is required to reach the transition state for C-D bond cleavage compared to C-H bond cleavage. This translates to a higher activation energy ($E_a$) for the reaction of the deuterated compound.\n\nSince the reaction rate is exponentially dependent on the activation energy (as described by the Arrhenius equation, $k = A \\exp(-E_a/RT)$), a higher activation energy for the C-D bond cleavage results in a significantly slower reaction rate for Compound II compared to Compound I.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A. The deuterium atoms in Compound II are slightly larger than hydrogen atoms, creating steric hindrance that impedes the approach of the amide anion to the ortho positions.**\n    This is incorrect. While the C-D bond length is slightly shorter than the C-H bond, the van der Waals radius of deuterium is considered identical to that of hydrogen for practical purposes in organic chemistry. The steric difference is negligible and cannot account for the large observed difference in reaction rates.\n\n*   **B. The rate-determining step of the reaction involves the cleavage of a bond to an ortho substituent, and the carbon-deuterium bond is significantly stronger than the carbon-hydrogen bond.**\n    This is the correct explanation. The deprotonation/de-deuteronation is the rate-determining step. The greater strength of the C-D bond compared to the C-H bond leads to a higher activation energy and thus a slower reaction rate. This is the definition of the primary kinetic isotope effect.\n\n*   **C. Deuterium is more electron-donating than hydrogen, which reduces the acidity of the ortho positions and disfavors the initial deprotonation step.**\n    This is incorrect. While deuterium is indeed slightly more electron-donating than protium due to a hyperconjugative effect (a bond with a lower zero-point energy is a better electron donor), this electronic effect is very small and cannot explain the substantial rate difference observed. The dominant effect is the KIE related to bond strength, not this minor electronic perturbation.\n\n*   **D. The benzyne intermediate formed from Compound II, 3-deuteriobenzyne, is less stable than the non-deuterated benzyne formed from Compound I, thus increasing the activation energy for its formation.**\n    This is incorrect. The stability of the benzyne intermediate is not significantly affected by the isotopic substitution at a position not involved in the \"triple\" bond. The Hammond postulate would suggest that the transition state resembles the aryl anion intermediate, and the stability of the final benzyne product has a lesser impact on the RDS. Moreover, there's no reason to believe 3-deuteriobenzyne is substantially less stable.\n\n*   **E. The presence of deuterium atoms at the ortho positions strengthens the carbon-bromine bond through an inductive effect, making the elimination of the bromide ion more difficult.**\n    This is incorrect. First, the C-Br bond cleavage occurs *after* the rate-determining deprotonation step, so a change in its strength would not affect the overall rate. Second, any electronic effect of deuterium on the C-Br bond would be minimal and not the primary reason for the observed phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the profound difference in reaction rates is a direct consequence of the primary kinetic isotope effect, where the stronger C-D bond must be broken in the rate-determining step for the deuterated substrate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding its formation and mechanism, the true power of the benzyne intermediate lies in its application in organic synthesis.
