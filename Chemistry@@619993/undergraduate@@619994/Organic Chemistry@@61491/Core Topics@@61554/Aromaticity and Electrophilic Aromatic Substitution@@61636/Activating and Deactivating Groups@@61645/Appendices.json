The reaction is to be carried out under identical, harsh nitrating conditions, using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid ($HNO_3$) and concentrated sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). Your task is to predict the outcome of this comparative experiment.\n\nWhich one of the following statements most accurately describes the relative reaction rates and the underlying electronic reasons?\n\nA. Benzaldehyde will react faster than nitrobenzene because the formyl group (–CHO) is a less powerful deactivating group than the nitro group (–NO$_2$).\nB. Nitrobenzene will react faster than benzaldehyde because the nitro group (–NO$_2$) is a less powerful deactivating group than the formyl group (–CHO).\nC. Both benzaldehyde and nitrobenzene will react at approximately the same rate because both the formyl and nitro groups are meta-directing deactivators.\nD. Benzaldehyde will react faster than nitrobenzene because the formyl group (–CHO) is an activating group, whereas the nitro group (–NO$_2$) is a deactivating group.\nE. Neither compound will undergo nitration because both substituents are strongly deactivating, which completely inhibits electrophilic aromatic substitution.", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic nitration under mixed acid is governed by the electrophile nitronium ion, generated under strongly acidic conditions. The rate-determining step of electrophilic aromatic substitution is formation of the sigma complex (arenium ion), whose stability (and thus the activation energy) is controlled by the electronic effect of the ring substituent. According to the Arrhenius relation, $k = A \\exp(-E_{a}/RT)$, a higher activation barrier $E_{a}$ yields a smaller rate constant $k$.\n\nElectron-withdrawing substituents deactivate the aromatic ring by reducing its electron density and destabilizing the sigma complex, especially for ortho/para attack where resonance places positive charge adjacent to the substituent. Consequently, strongly withdrawing groups are meta directing and reduce the rate. The nitro group $-\\text{NO}_2$ exerts a strong $-M$ (resonance withdrawing) effect, as well as a strong $-I$ (inductive withdrawing) effect; its resonance structures withdraw electron density from the ring into the nitro functionality. The formyl group $-\\text{CHO}$ is also $-M$ and $-I$, but it is a less powerful deactivator than $-\\text{NO}_2$. This established ordering is captured, for example, by Hammett parameters: $\\sigma_{m}(\\mathrm{NO}_2) > \\sigma_{m}(\\mathrm{CHO}) > 0$, implying stronger deactivation by $-\\text{NO}_2$. Therefore, the activation energies satisfy $E_{a,\\mathrm{NO}_2} > E_{a,\\mathrm{CHO}}$, and hence $k_{\\mathrm{NO}_2}  k_{\\mathrm{CHO}}$ via $k = A \\exp(-E_{a}/RT)$.\n\nBoth $-\\text{NO}_2$ and $-\\text{CHO}$ are meta-directing deactivators, but they do not deactivate to the same extent; $-\\text{NO}_2$ is markedly stronger. Under harsh mixed-acid conditions, nitration can occur for both substrates, but benzaldehyde will react faster than nitrobenzene.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A correctly states that benzaldehyde reacts faster because $-\\text{CHO}$ is less deactivating than $-\\text{NO}_2$.\n- B incorrectly reverses the relative deactivation strengths.\n- C is incorrect because, despite both being meta directors, their rates differ significantly.\n- D is incorrect because $-\\text{CHO}$ is deactivating, not activating.\n- E is incorrect because harsh conditions do effect nitration of both, albeit very slowly for nitrobenzene.\n\nThus, A is the most accurate statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2153701"}, {"introduction": "Halogens present a classic case where opposing electronic forces are at play, making them excellent subjects for a deeper study of substituent effects. This problem asks you to compare the reactivity of fluorobenzene and chlorobenzene, which requires you to weigh the deactivating inductive effect against the activating resonance effect. Successfully solving this requires an appreciation for how orbital overlap influences the strength of resonance, a key concept for explaining observed reactivity trends in electrophilic aromatic substitution [@problem_id:2153669].", "problem": "In the context of Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), the reactivity of a substituted benzene ring is governed by the interplay of two primary electronic effects exerted by the substituent: the inductive effect and the resonance effect. The inductive effect involves the withdrawal or donation of electron density through the sigma bond network, while the resonance effect involves the delocalization of lone pair or pi electrons through the pi system.\n\nHalogens are a classic case where these two effects are in opposition. For this problem, consider the following fundamental principles:\n1.  **Inductive Effect (-I):** Due to their high electronegativity, halogens withdraw electron density from the aromatic ring inductively, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack. The strength of this deactivating effect correlates with electronegativity. The electronegativity order is F  Cl  Br  I.\n2.  **Resonance Effect (+R):** Halogens possess lone pairs of electrons that can be donated into the aromatic ring through resonance. This effect increases electron density in the ring, which activates the ring towards electrophilic attack. The effectiveness of this donation depends on the quality of orbital overlap between the halogen's p-orbital and the carbon's 2p orbital in the pi system. Overlap is most effective when the interacting orbitals are of similar size and energy.\n\nGiven these principles, compare the overall reactivity of fluorobenzene and chlorobenzene in an EAS reaction. Which compound is more reactive, and what is the correct reasoning for this difference in reactivity?\n\nA. Fluorobenzene is more reactive. While its inductive effect is stronger, its resonance effect is significantly more effective due to better 2p-2p orbital overlap, and this enhanced resonance donation sufficiently counteracts the stronger induction, leading to a smaller net deactivation compared to chlorobenzene.\nB. Chlorobenzene is more reactive. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, so its powerful inductive withdrawing effect makes fluorobenzene the most deactivated and least reactive of all halobenzenes.\nC. Both are equally reactive. The stronger inductive withdrawal of fluorine is perfectly cancelled by its stronger resonance donation, leading to a net electronic effect identical to that of chlorine.\nD. Chlorobenzene is more reactive. The larger 3p orbital of chlorine allows for a more significant resonance donation of electron density compared to the smaller 2p orbital of fluorine, making the ring more activated.\nE. Fluorobenzene is more reactive. Its inductive effect is weaker than chlorine's, and its resonance effect is stronger, making it unambiguously more activated.", "solution": "Electrophilic aromatic substitution rate is governed by the net electronic effect of a substituent, which is the vector sum of an inductive term that is deactivating and a resonance term that is activating for substituents with lone pairs on atoms adjacent to the ring. Let the net substituent effect on reactivity be represented qualitatively by a parameter $\\sigma=\\sigma_{I}+\\sigma_{R}$, where $\\sigma_{I}0$ (electron withdrawal by induction, deactivating) and $\\sigma_{R}0$ (electron donation by resonance, activating). A smaller $\\sigma$ implies a smaller net deactivation and hence a higher EAS reactivity.\n\nFor halogens:\n- Inductive effect: electronegativity decreases down the group, so $|\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{F}}||\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}|$, i.e., $\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{F}}\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}0$.\n- Resonance effect: donation depends on orbital overlap between the halogen lone pair orbital and the ring $2p$ orbitals. The overlap integral satisfies $S_{2p\\text{-}2p}S_{3p\\text{-}2p}$, so the resonance donation of fluorine is stronger than that of chlorine, giving $|\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{F}}||\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}|$ and $\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{F}}\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}0$.\n\nComparing net effects:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\mathrm{F}}=\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{F}}+\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{F}},\\quad\n\\sigma^{\\mathrm{Cl}}=\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}+\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}.\n$$\nAlthough $\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{F}}\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, the more effective resonance donation of fluorine means that\n$$\n|\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{F}}-\\sigma_{R}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}||\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{F}}-\\sigma_{I}^{\\mathrm{Cl}}|,\n$$\nwhich yields\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\mathrm{F}}\\sigma^{\\mathrm{Cl}}.\n$$\nTherefore, fluorobenzene is less deactivated (more reactive) than chlorobenzene. Mechanistically, the better $2p$–$2p$ overlap in fluorobenzene provides greater stabilization of the Wheland intermediate and lowers the activation barrier relative to chlorobenzene sufficiently to offset the stronger inductive withdrawal by fluorine. Chlorine’s poorer $3p$–$2p$ overlap reduces its resonance donation; thus the net deactivation is greater for chlorobenzene.\n\nThis reasoning matches the observed ordering that halobenzenes are all deactivated overall, but fluorobenzene is the least deactivated among them compared to chlorobenzene.\n\nHence, the correct choice is that fluorobenzene is more reactive because its superior resonance donation (from better $2p$–$2p$ overlap) more than compensates for its stronger inductive withdrawal relative to chlorine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2153669"}, {"introduction": "Real-world organic synthesis often involves molecules with multiple functional groups and complex scaffolds, where several directing effects compete or cooperate.

This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction, where the electrophile is the nitronium ion, $\\text{NO}_2^+$, generated from the mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. To predict the major product, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the quinoline ring system.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Quinoline Ring System**\nQuinoline is a fused aromatic heterocycle composed of a benzene ring and a pyridine ring.\n- The pyridine ring contains an electronegative nitrogen atom, which makes this ring strongly electron-deficient and thus highly deactivated towards electrophilic substitution.\n- Consequently, EAS on the quinoline scaffold occurs preferentially on the more electron-rich benzene ring (also known as the carbocyclic ring), which comprises positions 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n- The fused pyridine ring as a whole acts as a deactivating group on the attached benzene ring. Within this carbocyclic ring, substitution generally favors the \"alpha\" positions (5 and 8) over the \"beta\" positions (6 and 7). This is because the intermediates formed by attack at the alpha positions are better stabilized. For example, the nitration of unsubstituted quinoline yields a mixture of 5-nitroquinoline and 8-nitroquinoline.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Methoxy Substituent**\nThe starting material is 6-methoxyquinoline, which has a methoxy group ($-\\text{OCH}_3$) at position 6.\n- The methoxy group is a powerful activating group for EAS. It has a lone pair on the oxygen atom that can be donated into the aromatic ring through resonance (a $+R$ or $+M$ effect). This effect strongly outweighs its electron-withdrawing inductive effect ($-I$ effect).\n- As a strong activating group, the methoxy group is an *ortho-, para-* director. For the substituent at position 6, the *ortho* positions are 5 and 7. The *para* position is 3, which is on the highly deactivated pyridine ring and can be discounted as a likely site for substitution.\n- Therefore, the methoxy group strongly activates the ring and directs the incoming electrophile to positions 5 and 7.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Competing and Synergistic Effects**\nWe must now combine the directing influences of the quinoline ring system and the methoxy substituent to determine the most reactive position.\n\n- **Position 5:** This position is *ortho* to the strongly activating methoxy group, so it is strongly electronically activated by resonance. Furthermore, position 5 is an \"alpha\" position of the quinoline system, which is inherently more reactive towards EAS than the \"beta\" positions. Thus, the activating effect of the methoxy group and the inherent reactivity of the quinoline ring are synergistic, both favoring substitution at C5.\n\n- **Position 7:** This position is also *ortho* to the strongly activating methoxy group and benefits from its resonance donation. However, position 7 is a \"beta\" position of the quinoline system, which is inherently less reactive than the \"alpha\" positions.\n\n- **Position 8:** This position is an inherently reactive \"alpha\" position of the quinoline ring. However, it is *meta* to the methoxy group. It does not benefit from the powerful ortho-, para-directing resonance effect of the methoxy group. While the whole ring is activated by the methoxy group, the directing effect does not favor this position.\n\n- **Positions on the Pyridine Ring (e.g., Position 2):** As discussed, this ring is strongly deactivated towards EAS and is not a plausible site for substitution under these conditions, especially when the other ring is so strongly activated.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nComparing the potential sites, position 5 is the most favored. It receives strong activation from the ortho-directing methoxy group, and it is also an intrinsically favored \"alpha\" position of the quinoline ring. The combination of these two favorable factors makes it the primary site of attack for the nitronium ion. Attack at position 7 is the next most likely possibility, but is disfavored relative to C5 due to C7 being an inherently less reactive \"beta\" position. Attack at C8 is significantly less likely as it is meta to the powerful directing group.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the mononitration of 6-methoxyquinoline is 6-methoxy-5-nitroquinoline. This corresponds to choice B. Choice E describes an isomer of the starting material and is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2153690"}]}
