A classic example is its reaction with molecular bromine ($Br_2$) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, such as iron(III) bromide ($FeBr_3$), to produce bromobenzene ($C_6H_5Br$) and hydrogen bromide ($HBr$).\n\nConsider the complete mechanism for the bromination of benzene using $Br_2$ and $FeBr_3$. From the list of statements below, identify all that are chemically correct descriptions of the species or steps involved in this reaction.\n\nA. The active electrophile that attacks the benzene ring is a free $Br^+$ cation, which is generated by the spontaneous heterolytic cleavage of a $Br_2$ molecule.\n\nB. The iron(III) bromide catalyst functions by reacting with a bromine molecule to form the complex anion $[FeBr_4]^-$.\n\nC.

The Lewis acid $FeBr_{3}$ coordinates to a $Br_{2}$ molecule to polarize the $Br{-}Br$ bond, which is often represented formally as generating a highly electrophilic bromine species together with the counterion $[FeBr_{4}]^{-}$. The aromatic $\\pi$ system of benzene donates electron density to the electrophilic bromine, forming a $\\sigma$ bond to bromine and producing the arenium ion (sigma complex), a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate. In the final step, a base removes the proton from the carbon that was attacked, re-forming the aromatic $\\pi$ system and giving $HBr$ while regenerating the $FeBr_{3}$ catalyst. In this mechanism, the base is the bromide contained in $[FeBr_{4}]^{-}$, which abstracts the proton to yield $HBr$ and $FeBr_{3}$.\n\nAssessing each statement:\n\nA. Incorrect. The active electrophile is not a free, freely solvated $Br^{+}$ formed by spontaneous heterolysis of $Br_{2}$. Instead, $Br_{2}$ is activated by complexation with $FeBr_{3}$, and electrophilic attack proceeds via the polarized $Br_{2}\\cdot FeBr_{3}$ complex or a formally represented $Br^{+}$ paired with $[FeBr_{4}]^{-}$; a free $Br^{+}$ is not generated by spontaneous heterolysis.\n\nB. Correct. The Lewis acid $FeBr_{3}$ reacts with $Br_{2}$ to form a complex that is commonly represented as $Br^{+}$ and the complex anion $[FeBr_{4}]^{-}$. The presence of $[FeBr_{4}]^{-}$ as the counterion and subsequent base is an essential feature of the mechanism.\n\nC. Correct. After electrophilic attack, the intermediate is a resonance-stabilized carbocation known as the sigma complex or arenium ion.\n\nD. Incorrect. Restoration of aromaticity occurs by deprotonation (loss of $H^{+}$) from the arenium ion; it is not by elimination of $Br^{-}$ from the carbocation. The $Br$ remains attached to the ring in the product.\n\nE. Correct. The benzene $\\pi$ electron system functions as the nucleophile, donating electron density to the electrophile.\n\nF. Incorrect.
