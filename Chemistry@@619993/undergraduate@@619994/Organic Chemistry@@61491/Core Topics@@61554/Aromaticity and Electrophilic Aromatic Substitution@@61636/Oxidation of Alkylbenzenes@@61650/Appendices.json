The benzylic carbon of the ethyl substituent is the carbon directly attached to the ring and bears benzylic hydrogens.\n\n2) The key reagent and condition is hot, concentrated aqueous potassium permanganate, followed by acidification. The well-established principle is that hot, aqueous $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ oxidizes any alkyl side chain on an aromatic ring that contains at least one benzylic hydrogen to a carboxylate, regardless of the length of the side chain. The aryl halide substituent (here, bromine) is not removed or otherwise modified under these conditions.\n\n3) Therefore, the ethyl group, which has benzylic hydrogens, is fully oxidized to a carboxylate.

Options B, C, D, E, and F are inconsistent with the benzylic oxidation outcome: benzoic acid would require loss of bromine (which does not occur here), partial oxidation to an alcohol or ketone does not occur under these vigorous conditions (the oxidation proceeds to the acid), and dihydroxylation of the aromatic ring does not occur under these conditions.

This problem challenges you to move beyond simple product prediction and analyze the substrate's structure to determine its reactivity. By identifying the compound that resists oxidation, you will reinforce your understanding of the crucial role that benzylic hydrogens play in the reaction mechanism, a key detail for planning a successful synthesis. [@problem_id:2187045]", "problem": "The permanganate oxidation of alkylbenzenes is a classic transformation in organic synthesis, used to convert an alkyl side chain on an aromatic ring into a carboxylic acid. The reaction is typically carried out by heating the substrate with an aqueous solution of potassium permanganate ($\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$), often under basic conditions, followed by an acidic workup. This process is known to be selective, and its success depends on the structure of the alkyl substituent.\n\nAn organic chemist plans to subject several aromatic hydrocarbons to these vigorous oxidative conditions. The goal is to identify which compound, due to its specific molecular structure, will fail to be converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nFrom the list below, identify the compound that will not undergo oxidation of its alkyl substituent to a carboxylic acid group when treated with hot, aqueous potassium permanganate followed by acidification.\n\nA. 1-tert-Butyl-4-ethylbenzene\n\nB. 1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene\n\nC. 9,10-Dihydrophenanthrene\n\nD. 1-Adamantylbenzene\n\nE. Indane", "solution": "Fundamental principle: Hot, aqueous, basic $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ followed by acidic workup oxidizes an alkyl substituent on an aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid only if the benzylic carbon (the carbon directly attached to the ring) bears at least one hydrogen. If there is at least one benzylic C–H bond, oxidative cleavage of the side chain occurs to give an aryl carboxylate (after workup, the carboxylic acid). If the benzylic carbon has no hydrogens (e.g., is quaternary), oxidation does not proceed under these conditions.\n\nApply this criterion to each option:\n\nA. 1-tert-Butyl-4-ethylbenzene. The ethyl substituent has benzylic hydrogens at the methylene directly attached to the ring, so it is oxidized by $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ to give the corresponding carboxyl group at that position. The tert-butyl substituent lacks benzylic hydrogens and remains intact, but the molecule as a whole is converted to an aromatic carboxylic acid (p-tert-butylbenzoic acid). Therefore, A does undergo the oxidation to a carboxylic acid.\n\nB. 1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene. In each isopropyl group, the benzylic carbon is secondary and bears one hydrogen; such benzylic C–H bonds are oxidized by hot $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$. Under vigorous conditions, this yields the triacid (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid). Therefore, B undergoes oxidation to carboxylic acids.\n\nC. 9,10-Dihydrophenanthrene. The 9- and 10-positions are benzylic methylenes bearing benzylic hydrogens. These positions are readily oxidized by $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$; such systems are well known to undergo benzylic oxidation (often to the corresponding quinone or, under more forcing conditions, to ring-cleaved dicarboxylic acids). The key criterion—presence of benzylic hydrogens—is satisfied, so it does not fail the oxidation requirement.\n\nD. 1-Adamantylbenzene. The carbon of the adamantyl group bonded to the ring is a bridgehead tertiary carbon that, upon substitution, is quaternary at the benzylic position and bears no hydrogens. With no benzylic C–H bond, the necessary initial oxidation cannot occur, so hot $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ does not convert this substituent into a carboxyl group. Therefore, D will not be converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nE. Indane. The saturated ring fused to the benzene contains benzylic methylene groups; hot $\\mathrm{KMnO_4}$ oxidizes such benzylic positions exhaustively to give ortho-dicarboxylation on the aromatic ring (o-phthalic acid). Therefore, E does undergo oxidation to carboxylic acids.\n\nConclusion: The compound that fails to be converted into an aromatic carboxylic acid under these conditions is the one with no benzylic hydrogens at the substituted position, namely 1-adamantylbenzene (D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2187045"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting products, understanding the stoichiometry of a reaction allows us to use it for quantitative analysis.
