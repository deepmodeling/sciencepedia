According to IUPAC rules:\n1) Choose benzene as the parent and number the ring to give the lowest set of locants. For meta substitution, the lowest set is $1,3$ rather than $1,5$.\n2) When two different numbering schemes both give the same lowest set of locants (here, $1,3$ whether numbering starts at the ethyl or the nitro group), the tie is resolved by assigning the lowest locant to the substituent that is cited first alphabetically. Between ethyl and nitro, \"ethyl\" precedes \"nitro\" alphabetically, so ethyl is assigned position $1$ and nitro position $3$.\n3) List substituents in alphabetical order with their locants, giving the systematic name as $1$-ethyl-$3$-nitrobenzene.\n\nComparing with the options:\n- A and D reflect an alternative numbering that does not follow the alphabetical tie-breaker.\n- B is a common name using the meta descriptor, not the fully systematic locanted name.\n- E uses the non-preferred locant set $1,5$.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is $1$-ethyl-$3$-nitrobenzene, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2204404"}, {"introduction": "Building on basic nomenclature, this exercise explores the concept of constitutional isomerism within aromatic systems.

A constitutional isomer differs by the connectivity of atoms. For dichlorobenzene, the two chlorine substituents can be placed at different positions on the benzene ring, but many apparent position labels are equivalent by the symmetry of benzene.\n\nLet the benzene ring positions be labeled cyclically as integers modulo 6: $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Any placement of two identical substituents corresponds to an unordered pair $\\{i,j\\}$ with $i \\neq j$. Due to the rotational and reflection symmetry of benzene, the only invariant distinguishing such pairs is the minimal ring distance\n$$\nd=\\min\\left(|i-j|,\\;6-|i-j|\\right),\n$$\nwhich can take values $d \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.

The exercise requires you to correctly identify the parent compound by prioritizing a principal functional group and systematically name a branched alkyl substituent attached to the ring.

The molecule is a disubstituted benzene with an amino group, so the amine is the principal functional group and the parent can be named using the retained name “aniline” (acceptable in IUPAC) or as “benzenamine” in fully systematic form. The other substituent is specified as $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{3}$ at the para position relative to the amino group.\n\nNext, we determine the correct systematic name for the alkyl substituent. The structure $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{3}$ is the neopentyl group, whose systematic name is 2,2-dimethylpropyl. This follows from numbering the propyl substituent from the point of attachment (the carbon directly attached to the ring is carbon 1), giving methyl groups at carbon 2 twice, so the substituent is 2,2-dimethylpropyl. Therefore, the substituent name corresponding to $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{3}$ is 2,2-dimethylpropyl.\n\nThe ring substitution pattern is para relative to the amino group, so the locant for the 2,2-dimethylpropyl group is 4 when the amino group is taken as position 1. Hence, the systematic name using the retained parent “aniline” is 4-(2,2-dimethylpropyl)aniline.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- Option A: 4-(2,2-dimethylpropyl)aniline. This correctly identifies the substituent and uses an allowed retained parent name, with the correct locant 4 for the para position.\n- Option B: 1-(2,2-dimethylpropyl)-4-aminobenzene. This treats the amino as a substituent “amino-” rather than as the principal suffix “-amine.” The preferred IUPAC approach would be “benzenamine” (or retained “aniline”) with the alkyl group at position 4. Thus this is not the preferred systematic name.\n- Option C: p-neopentylaniline. This uses the non-systematic “neopentyl” and the non-systematic “p-” descriptor; not IUPAC systematic.\n- Option D: 4-neopentylbenzamine. This uses the non-systematic “neopentyl,” and “benzamine” is not the correct IUPAC parent (the correct suffix form is “benzenamine”); therefore incorrect.\n- Option E: 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)aniline. The substituent 1,1-dimethylpropyl implies a different connectivity (quaternary carbon at the point of attachment), which does not match $-\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_{3})_{3}$; therefore incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct IUPAC-consistent choice is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2204434"}]}
