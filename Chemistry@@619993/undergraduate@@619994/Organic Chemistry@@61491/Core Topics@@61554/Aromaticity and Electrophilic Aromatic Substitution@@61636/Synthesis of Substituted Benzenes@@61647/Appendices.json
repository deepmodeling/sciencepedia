The reactions involved are electrophilic aromatic substitutions (EAS) and, in one proposal, a carbonyl reduction. The key directing and reactivity principles are:\n- Friedel–Crafts alkylation introduces an alkyl group; alkyl substituents are activating and direct further EAS to ortho/para.\n- Halogens are ortho/para directors but are deactivating; deactivated rings react more slowly in Friedel–Crafts alkylation and may even fail under standard conditions.\n- Acyl groups are deactivating and meta-directing; after acylation, subsequent EAS occurs meta to the acyl group.\n- Clemmensen reduction of an aryl ketone reduces the carbonyl to a methylene, converting an acyl substituent $-\\text{COCH}_3$ to an ethyl group $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$; it does not shorten the side chain to a methyl group.\n- Simultaneous presence of multiple strong electrophiles and a Lewis acid leads to competing reactions and poor selectivity.\n\nEvaluate each route:\n\nA. First, Friedel–Crafts methylation: benzene + $\\text{CH}_3\\text{Cl}/\\text{AlCl}_3 \\rightarrow$ toluene. Methyl is an activating ortho/para director. Second, bromination: toluene + $\\text{Br}_2/\\text{FeBr}_3 \\rightarrow$ o- and p-bromotoluene as the major products. The para isomer can be favored under controlled conditions (sterics and temperature) and is readily enriched and isolated (the para isomer often crystallizes preferentially), making this route practical for obtaining p-bromotoluene as a major isolable isomer. This sequence employs reliable steps with good rate and selectivity management.\n\nB. First, bromination: benzene + $\\text{Br}_2/\\text{FeBr}_3 \\rightarrow$ bromobenzene. Second, Friedel–Crafts methylation: bromobenzene + $\\text{CH}_3\\text{Cl}/\\text{AlCl}_3$. Because the bromo substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive toward Friedel–Crafts alkylation; the reaction is sluggish and may require harsher conditions, leading to low yield and potential side reactions (including rearrangements and polyalkylation). Orientation would still be ortho/para, giving a mixture, not specifically favoring para, and overall practicality is inferior to A.\n\nC. First, Friedel–Crafts acylation: benzene + $\\text{CH}_3\\text{COCl}/\\text{AlCl}_3 \\rightarrow$ acetophenone. The acyl group is meta-directing; bromination next gives meta-bromoacetophenone predominantly. Clemmensen reduction with $\\text{Zn(Hg)}, \\text{HCl}$ converts $-\\text{COCH}_3$ to $-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$, yielding meta-bromoethylbenzene, not p-bromotoluene.

They devise the following three-step synthetic plan:\n\n1.  Oxidation of toluene using hot, concentrated potassium permanganate ($\\text{KMnO}_4$) followed by an acidic workup to produce benzoic acid.\n2.

Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and significant chemical reason why this synthetic plan is inefficient and likely to give a very poor yield?\n\nA. The methyl group of toluene is an ortho, para-director, and this property should have been utilized to install the substituents before the final oxidation step.\n\nB. The carboxylic acid group is an ortho, para-director, so the nitration in step 2 would incorrectly yield a mixture of 2-nitrobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\nC. The final bromination step is performed on an aromatic ring that is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making the reaction extremely slow and low-yielding.\n\nD. The bromine atom is too large to be installed at the C5 position due to severe steric hindrance from the adjacent carboxylic acid and nitro groups.\n\nE. The nitration and bromination steps should be reversed; brominating benzoic acid first would lead to a much higher yield of the final product.", "solution": "We analyze each step and the directing/activation effects to assess where the inefficiency arises, using standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) principles:\n\n1. Oxidation: Toluene is converted to benzoic acid. This removes the electron-donating methyl group and replaces it with a strongly electron-withdrawing carboxyl group. The carboxyl group deactivates the ring toward EAS and is a meta director. This choice sacrifices the activation and ortho, para-directing power of the methyl group.\n\n2. Nitration of benzoic acid: In EAS, a carboxyl group directs electrophiles meta. Therefore, nitration of benzoic acid gives predominantly 3-nitrobenzoic acid (meta to the carboxyl group). Although the ring is deactivated, a single deactivator still allows nitration under typical mixed-acid conditions. Hence step 2 is feasible and regiochemically correct.\n\n3. Bromination of 3-nitrobenzoic acid: The substrate now bears two strong electron-withdrawing groups (the carboxyl group and the nitro group), both of which are deactivating and meta directing. Although the only available position that is meta to both is C5 (the desired site), the combined deactivation dramatically reduces the rate of EAS. Even with a Lewis acid such as $\\text{FeBr}_3$, electrophilic bromination on a doubly deactivated ring is extremely slow and typically requires forcing conditions, leading to very low yields and possible side reactions. This is the dominant inefficiency and yield problem.\n\nNow we evaluate the statements:\n\n- A: While the methyl group is indeed an ortho, para director, using it to preinstall substituents would not directly provide the 3,5-pattern relative to the eventual carboxyl group, because methyl directs to ortho and para rather than meta positions. Although postponing oxidation can sometimes help, this reasoning does not capture the main cause of poor yield here.\n- B: Incorrect. A carboxylic acid is a meta director, not an ortho, para director; nitration of benzoic acid gives mainly 3-nitrobenzoic acid.\n- C: Correct. The final bromination targets a ring that is strongly deactivated by two electron-withdrawing groups, making EAS bromination extremely slow and low yielding.\n- D: Incorrect. C5 is meta to both substituents, not flanked by immediate ortho steric clashes with both; sterics are not the principal barrier.\n- E: Incorrect. Reversing nitration and bromination still leaves the problem of performing EAS on a strongly deactivated ring; bromination of benzoic acid is also difficult, and nitration after bromination would be even more deactivated.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and significant reason for poor synthetic efficiency is the severe deactivation in the final bromination step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2207590"}, {"introduction": "Powerful synthetic tools often come with specific limitations.

This complex both sequesters the catalyst needed to generate the acylium ion and strongly deactivates the aromatic ring toward electrophilic aromatic substitution, thereby preventing Friedel–Crafts acylation.\n\nA viable strategy is to protect the aniline as an amide (e.g., acetanilide) so that the nitrogen lone pair is delocalized into the carbonyl and is significantly less basic. The amide therefore does not strongly bind $\\text{AlCl}_3$ and remains an ortho/para director, enabling the Friedel–Crafts acylation to occur, with the para position favored by sterics. After installing the benzoyl group, the amide protecting group is removed by hydrolysis to regenerate the free aniline, now bearing the para-benzoyl substituent, that is, 4-aminobenzophenone.\n\nConcretely, the correct sequence is:\n1. Protection: aniline reacts with acetic anhydride by nucleophilic acyl substitution to give acetanilide. This transforms a strongly basic amine into a less basic amide that will not poison $\\text{AlCl}_3$ and remains an ortho/para director.\n2. Friedel–Crafts acylation: benzoyl chloride with $\\text{AlCl}_3$ generates the benzoyl acylium ion; electrophilic aromatic substitution on acetanilide occurs predominantly at the para position to give $p$-benzoyl acetanilide.\n3.

Option B starts from benzene rather than aniline and, after benzoylation, nitration occurs meta to the benzoyl group (the carbonyl is a meta director), and subsequent reduction gives $m$-aminobenzophenone, not the para isomer. Option C attempts Friedel–Crafts acylation on nitrobenzene, but the nitro group is a strong ring deactivator, and Friedel–Crafts acylation does not proceed. Option D forms an amide by reaction of aniline with benzoyl chloride, but a subsequent “rearrangement” with $\\text{AlCl}_3$ is not a valid pathway to install a benzoyl group onto the ring from an anilide; furthermore, it lacks a deprotection step to reveal the free amine. Option E performs the correct protection and acylation, but then uses $\\text{LiAlH}_4$, which reduces the aryl ketone to a benzylic alcohol (and reduces the amide), thereby destroying the benzophenone carbonyl; this does not furnish 4-aminobenzophenone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2207597"}]}
