This practice challenges you to apply the core criteria—cyclic structure, planarity, full conjugation, and the crucial $(4n+2)$ π-electron count—to several fundamental carbocyclic species. By working through these classic examples, you will build a solid foundation for recognizing aromatic stability and anti-aromatic instability [@problem_id:2164270].", "problem": "In organic chemistry, the concept of aromaticity is used to describe a special stability found in certain cyclic, planar, and fully conjugated molecules. According to Hückel's rule, a molecule is considered aromatic if it possesses a total of $(4n+2)$ pi electrons, where $n$ is any non-negative integer (i.e., $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$). Conversely, a molecule that meets the first three criteria but has $4n$ pi electrons (where $n$ is an integer) is considered anti-aromatic and is notably unstable. Molecules that fail to meet any of the first three criteria (cyclic, planar, or fully conjugated) are classified as non-aromatic.\n\nBased on these criteria, determine which one of the following species is aromatic.\n\nA. Cyclopropenyl anion\nB. Cyclobutadiene\nC. Cyclopropenyl cation\nD.

If a species is not cyclic, not planar, or not fully conjugated, it is non-aromatic.\n\nEvaluate each option by verifying conjugation and counting $N_{\\pi}$:\n\nCyclopropenyl anion (A): The three-membered ring is cyclic and can adopt a planar, fully conjugated arrangement with $p$ orbitals on each carbon. The anion places a lone pair in a $p$ orbital, leading to a total $\\pi$ electron count of $N_{\\pi}=2$ (from one double bond) $+2$ (from the lone pair) $=4$. Since $4=4\\times 1$, this matches $N_{\\pi}=4n$ and therefore meets the anti-aromatic criterion, not aromatic.\n\nCyclobutadiene (B): The four-membered ring with two double bonds is cyclic and, in the idealized square form, planar and fully conjugated with $N_{\\pi}=2+2=4$. Since $4=4\\times 1$, it falls under $N_{\\pi}=4n$ and is anti-aromatic; in practice it distorts to avoid anti-aromaticity, but it is not aromatic.\n\nCyclopropenyl cation (C): The three-membered ring is cyclic, planar, and fully conjugated with one electron pair in the $\\pi$ system delocalized over three $p$ orbitals. The total $\\pi$ electron count is $N_{\\pi}=2$. This satisfies $N_{\\pi}=4n+2$ with $n=0$ (since $2=4\\times 0+2$). Hence it is aromatic.\n\nCyclopentadienyl cation (D): The five-membered ring with two double bonds is cyclic and can be planar and fully conjugated, but the cationic center has an empty $p$ orbital and contributes no extra $\\pi$ electrons. Thus $N_{\\pi}=2+2=4$, which matches $N_{\\pi}=4n$ with $n=1$, indicating anti-aromaticity rather than aromaticity.\n\nAmong the given options, only the cyclopropenyl cation satisfies $N_{\\pi}=4n+2$ while being cyclic, planar, and fully conjugated.

The sulfur atom in thiophene is effectively $\\text{sp}^2$-hybridized; it has two lone pairs, of which one occupies an unhybridized p orbital perpendicular to the ring and overlaps with the adjacent carbon p orbitals, while the other lone pair lies in the plane of the ring and does not participate in $\\pi$ conjugation.

This problem investigates pentafulvene, a molecule whose electronic structure is best understood by considering its resonance contributors. You will explore how the formation of an aromatic ring within a charge-separated resonance structure can create a significant dipole moment, demonstrating that aromaticity is a powerful driving force that shapes a molecule's character [@problem_id:2164253].", "problem": "Pentafulvene is an organic molecule with the chemical formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$.

The molecule will have a significant dipole moment, with the center of positive charge located on the exocyclic methylene group and the center of negative charge on the five-membered ring.\nD. The molecule will rapidly isomerize into benzene and thus its dipole moment is transient and immeasurable.\nE. The molecule's high degree of symmetry will cause all local bond dipoles to cancel, resulting in a zero net dipole moment.", "solution": "We analyze the dominant resonance contributors of pentafulvene to predict the direction and magnitude of its ground-state dipole moment.\n\nFirst, note that the molecule is a planar, fully conjugated hydrocarbon with all carbon atoms $\\text{sp}^{2}$-hybridized, creating a continuous $\\pi$ system. Although it contains only carbon and hydrogen, polarity can arise from asymmetric charge distribution in its resonance hybrid. The electric dipole moment is defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\sum q_{i}\\mathbf{r}_{i}$, so any persistent separation of positive and negative charge will yield a nonzero $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nConsider two key zwitterionic resonance contributors arising from the cross-conjugated exocyclic double bond:\n1) Electron density flows from the exocyclic $\\pi$ bond into the ring, yielding a resonance form in which the five-membered ring carries a negative charge while the exocyclic methylene carbon bears a positive charge. In this form, the ring has $6$ $\\pi$ electrons, satisfying Hückel’s aromaticity condition $4n+2$ with $n=1$. Aromatic stabilization lowers the energy of this contributor.\n2) Electron density flows from the ring to the exocyclic $\\pi$ bond, yielding a resonance form in which the ring carries a positive charge and the exocyclic methylene carbon bears a negative charge. In this form, the ring has $4$ $\\pi$ electrons, corresponding to $4n$ with $n=1$, which is antiaromatic and therefore strongly destabilized.\n\nBy Hückel’s rule, an aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion ($6$ $\\pi$ electrons, $4n+2$ with $n=1$) is significantly stabilized, whereas a cyclopentadienyl cation ($4$ $\\pi$ electrons, $4n$ with $n=1$) is destabilized by antiaromaticity. Therefore, the resonance contributor with negative charge on the ring and positive charge on the exocyclic methylene is favored relative to the opposite polarity. Consequently, in the resonance hybrid, electron density is biased toward the five-membered ring, and there is a significant, persistent separation of charge with the center of negative charge on the ring and the center of positive charge on the exocyclic methylene.\n\nThis implies a significant net dipole moment directed from the exocyclic methylene carbon (positive) toward the ring (negative). Hence:\n- A is false because hydrocarbons can be polar if their resonance hybrid is polarized.\n- B is false because it assigns the more negative character to the exocyclic group, which corresponds to the antiaromatic contributor and is disfavored.\n- D is false because pentafulvene does not spontaneously isomerize to benzene under ground-state conditions.\n- E is false because the molecule lacks the requisite symmetry to cancel bond dipoles entirely and, more importantly, exhibits a polarized resonance hybrid.\n\nThus, the most accurate prediction is that the molecule has a significant dipole moment with positive charge on the exocyclic methylene and negative charge on the five-membered ring.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2164253"}]}
