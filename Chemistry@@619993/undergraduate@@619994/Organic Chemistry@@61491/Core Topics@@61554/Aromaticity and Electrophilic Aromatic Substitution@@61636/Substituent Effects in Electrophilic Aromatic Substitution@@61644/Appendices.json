{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp substituent effects, we must move beyond single-molecule reactions and consider competitive scenarios, which more closely mimic the complexity of real-world chemical synthesis. This practice problem models a common synthetic challenge: what happens when an electrophile has a choice between two different aromatic rings? By analyzing the competition between an activated ring and a deactivated ring for a limited amount of reagent, you will develop a deeper, practical understanding of activating and deactivating groups [@problem_id:2206084]. This exercise highlights not just where a reaction occurs, but, more fundamentally, which molecule reacts at all.", "problem": "In a synthetic chemistry laboratory, a student prepares a reaction flask containing an equimolar mixture of toluene and nitrobenzene dissolved in an inert solvent. To this mixture, exactly one molar equivalent of molecular bromine ($\\text{Br}_2$) is added, followed by a catalytic amount of anhydrous iron(III) bromide ($\\text{FeBr}_3$). The reaction is allowed to proceed to completion at room temperature. Assuming the reaction yields are high, which of the following options best describes the major organic product(s) that would be isolated from the reaction mixture?\n\nA. 3-Bromonitrobenzene\n\nB. A mixture of 2-bromotoluene and 4-bromotoluene\n\nC. (Bromomethyl)benzene\n\nD. A mixture of 4-bromotoluene and 3-bromonitrobenzene\n\nE. 3-Bromotoluene", "solution": "This problem requires an understanding of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), specifically the directing and activating/deactivating effects of substituents on a benzene ring in a competitive reaction scenario.\n\nStep 1: Identify the reaction type and the electrophile.\nThe reagents are molecular bromine ($\\text{Br}_2$) and a Lewis acid catalyst, iron(III) bromide ($\\text{FeBr}_3$). This combination is characteristic of an electrophilic aromatic bromination reaction. The catalyst polarizes the $\\text{Br}-\\text{Br}$ bond, generating a potent electrophile, the bromonium ion ($\\text{Br}^+$) or a complex that functions as its equivalent.\n$$Br_2 + FeBr_3 \\rightleftharpoons Br^+ + FeBr_4^-$$\n\nStep 2: Analyze the substrates and their substituents.\nThe reaction mixture contains two aromatic substrates: toluene and nitrobenzene.\n- Toluene has a methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) attached to the benzene ring.\n- Nitrobenzene has a nitro group ($-\\text{NO}_2$) attached to the benzene ring.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the effect of each substituent on the reactivity of the aromatic ring.\nThe rate of electrophilic aromatic substitution is determined by the electron density of the aromatic ring. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) increase the electron density, making the ring more nucleophilic and thus more reactive towards electrophiles. They are called \"activating\" groups. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decrease the electron density, making the ring less nucleophilic and less reactive. They are called \"deactivating\" groups.\n- The methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) in toluene is an EDG, primarily through hyperconjugation and weak inductive effects. Therefore, the methyl group is an **activating group**. It makes the toluene ring significantly more reactive than unsubstituted benzene.\n- The nitro group ($-\\text{NO}_2$) in nitrobenzene is a strong EWG due to both strong inductive and resonance effects. Therefore, the nitro group is a strong **deactivating group**. It makes the nitrobenzene ring vastly less reactive than unsubstituted benzene.\n\nStep 4: Compare the relative rates of reaction for the two substrates.\nSince toluene is activated and nitrobenzene is strongly deactivated, the rate of bromination for toluene is many orders of magnitude faster than the rate of bromination for nitrobenzene. The electrophile ($\\text{Br}^+$) will react preferentially with the more nucleophilic (i.e., more activated) ring.\n\nStep 5: Consider the stoichiometry of the reaction.\nThe problem states that only one molar equivalent of $\\text{Br}_2$ is used for an equimolar mixture of the two substrates. This means there is only enough electrophile to react with half of the total aromatic molecules present. Due to the vast difference in reaction rates, the limited amount of electrophile will react almost exclusively with the much more reactive substrate, which is toluene. Negligible amounts of brominated nitrobenzene will be formed.\n\nStep 6: Determine the regioselectivity of the reaction with toluene.\nNow that we have established that toluene is the substrate that reacts, we must determine where the bromine atom will add to the ring. This is governed by the directing effect of the substituent.\n- The methyl group ($-\\text{CH}_3$) is an **ortho, para-director**. It stabilizes the carbocation intermediates formed during electrophilic attack at the ortho and para positions through resonance and hyperconjugation.\n- Therefore, the bromination of toluene will yield a mixture of the ortho-substituted product (2-bromotoluene) and the para-substituted product (4-bromotoluene). The meta-substituted product (3-bromotoluene) is not formed in any significant quantity. Typically, the para isomer is the major product of the two due to reduced steric hindrance compared to the ortho position.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. 3-Bromonitrobenzene: This would be the product if nitrobenzene reacted. This is incorrect because nitrobenzene is highly deactivated and will not compete effectively with toluene.\n- B. A mixture of 2-bromotoluene and 4-bromotoluene: This correctly identifies that the activated substrate, toluene, reacts and that the reaction gives the expected ortho and para products. Both are considered the major products of the reaction in the sense that they are formed in high yield relative to any other possible product.\n- C. (Bromomethyl)benzene: This is the product of benzylic bromination, which typically occurs under radical conditions (e.g., using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) with light or a radical initiator), not under EAS conditions with a Lewis acid catalyst.\n- D. A mixture of 4-bromotoluene and 3-bromonitrobenzene: This incorrectly suggests that a significant amount of both substrates react. Given the huge rate difference, this is not the case.\n- E. 3-Bromotoluene: This is the meta-isomer. The methyl group is an ortho, para-director, so this product is not formed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the major organic products will be the ortho and para isomers of bromotoluene. Option B is the best description of this outcome.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2206084"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise demonstrated that deactivated rings are poor competitors in electrophilic reactions, they are not completely inert. Under sufficiently energetic, or \"forcing,\" conditions, substitution can occur, but the question of regioselectivity remains. This problem [@problem_id:2206109] challenges you to predict the outcome of nitrating benzonitrile, which features a strongly deactivating cyano group ($-\\text{CN}$), thereby clarifying the electronic principles that govern regioselectivity for meta-directing substituents.", "problem": "In the synthesis of precursors for advanced materials, precise control over regioselectivity is paramount. A chemist is investigating the functionalization of benzonitrile ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{CN}$), a common industrial starting material.

Importantly, $-\\text{CN}$ is meta-directing: for ortho or para attack, the $\\sigma$-complex resonance structures include a form with the positive charge located at the carbon bearing the cyano group, which is especially destabilized by the electron-withdrawing $-\\text{CN}$. In contrast, for meta attack, none of the key resonance forms places the positive charge on the ipso carbon bearing $-\\text{CN}$, avoiding this destabilization. Therefore, meta substitution is favored despite overall deactivation.\n\nConsequently, under sufficiently strong nitration conditions (heating with concentrated mixed acid), benzonitrile undergoes electrophilic nitration predominantly at the meta position to give 3-nitrobenzonitrile. Thus among the options, the single major monosubstituted product is 3-nitrobenzonitrile.\n\nOptions proposing ortho or para products (A, B) or their mixture (D) are disfavored due to the directing effect of $-\\text{CN}$, and option E is incorrect because such deactivated rings can still undergo nitration under forcing conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2206109"}, {"introduction": "Activating groups are well-known to direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, but the distribution between these two sites is rarely random.
