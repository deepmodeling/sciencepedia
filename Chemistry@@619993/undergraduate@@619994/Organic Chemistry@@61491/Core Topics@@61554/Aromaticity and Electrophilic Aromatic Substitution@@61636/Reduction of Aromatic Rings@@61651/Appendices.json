A key to mastering this reaction lies in understanding how substituents on the ring direct the regiochemical outcome.

The reaction is carried out by dissolving the starting material in a mixture of liquid ammonia and ethanol, followed by the slow addition of sodium metal. After the reaction is complete and the mixture is carefully quenched, the organic products are isolated. Assuming the reaction proceeds to yield a single major organic product, which of the following compounds represents this product?\n\nA. 1,4-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene\nB. 1,4-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene\nC. 2,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene\nD. cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane\nE. No reaction occurs under these conditions.", "solution": "The described conditions (sodium metal in liquid ammonia with an alcohol as proton source) are those of the Birch reduction. The Birch reduction converts an aromatic ring to a nonconjugated 1,4-cyclohexadiene by the sequence of steps: \n(1) single-electron transfer to form a radical anion, \n(2) protonation at a position of highest anionic character, \n(3) a second single-electron transfer, and \n(4) a second protonation, furnishing a 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\nRegiochemistry is governed by the substituent’s electronic effect on the radical anion. For electron-donating groups such as alkyl groups, the carbons bearing the substituents remain $sp^2$-hybridized (that is, they end up as part of the double bonds in the 1,4-cyclohexadiene product). This is because this pathway avoids placing negative charge on the electron-rich substituted carbons in the reaction intermediates.\n\nApplying this to 1,4-dimethylbenzene (p-xylene), both methyl groups are electron-donating alkyl groups. Due to the para-disubstituted symmetry, this implies that both methyl-bearing carbons remain $sp^2$ in the product. Therefore, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene has double bonds at the carbons bearing the methyl substituents, corresponding to 1,4-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A places both methyl groups on $sp^2$ carbons in a 1,4-cyclohexadiene, matching the Birch outcome for para dialkylbenzene.\n- B would place one methyl on $sp^2$ and the other on $sp^3$, which is inconsistent with the symmetry and directing effects.\n- C changes the substitution pattern (implying rearrangement), which does not occur in a Birch reduction.\n- D is complete hydrogenation, which is not achieved under Birch conditions.\n- E is incorrect because Birch reduction does proceed under the given conditions.\n\nThus, the single major product is 1,4-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2195344"}, {"introduction": "Real-world organic synthesis often involves molecules with multiple functional groups, demanding a high degree of precision and selectivity. The ability to choose a reagent that reacts with one part of a molecule while leaving another untouched is a critical skill for any chemist.

The target transformation is selective dearomatization of the benzene ring to a non-aromatic 1,4-cyclohexadiene while leaving the terminal alkene unchanged.\n\nWe assess each reagent set based on known chemoselectivities:\n\n- Option A employs catalytic hydrogenation with excess $H_2$ and $Pd/C$ under high pressure. Catalytic hydrogenation readily reduces isolated alkenes, and under high pressure it can eventually hydrogenate aromatic rings to cyclohexanes. This would hydrogenate both the aromatic ring and the terminal alkene, thus failing the selectivity requirement.\n\n- Option B uses $NaBH_4$ in methanol. $NaBH_4$ is a hydride donor that reduces polar $\\pi$-bonds such as aldehydes and ketones. It does not reduce aromatic rings or isolated alkenes. Therefore, it would not produce the desired non-aromatic diene.\n\n- Option C uses $LiAlH_4$ followed by aqueous workup. $LiAlH_4$ reduces polarized bonds such as $C=O$ or $C-X$ but does not reduce aromatic rings or isolated alkenes. Thus, it is not suitable.\n\n- Option D uses $Na$ in liquid $NH_3(\\text{l})$ with an alcohol such as ethanol (Birch reduction conditions). The Birch reduction involves sequential electron transfer from the alkali metal to the arene to form a radical anion, protonation by the alcohol, a second electron transfer, and a second protonation, yielding a 1,4-cyclohexadiene. For anisole (an electron-donating substituent), the ring is reduced to a non-aromatic diene in a predictable pattern, and crucially, isolated nonconjugated alkenes are typically unreactive under these dissolving metal conditions. Therefore, the aromatic ring is selectively reduced while the terminal alkene remains intact.\n\n- Option E employs ozonolysis followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This would cleave the terminal alkene and leave the aromatic ring unaffected, contrary to the goal.\n\nTherefore, the only reagent set that selectively reduces the aromatic ring to a non-aromatic diene while preserving the isolated terminal alkene is the Birch reduction: $Na$, $NH_3(\\text{l})$, EtOH.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2195374"}, {"introduction": "The power of a chemical reaction is often realized not in isolation, but as a step within a larger synthetic sequence.

For rings bearing an electron-donating substituent with lone pairs, such as a methoxy group, the reduction pattern places the double bonds away from the substituent; the carbon bearing the methoxy group becomes $sp^3$, giving a 1,4-cyclohexadiene in which the methoxy-bearing carbon is saturated (specifically, 1-methoxy-1,4-cyclohexadiene). This involves two successive one-electron transfers from the metal, followed by two protonations from the alcohol. Therefore, lithium metal in liquid ammonia with tert-butanol is the correct first step.\n\nPrinciple for step 2 (isomerization to conjugated enol ether): To obtain 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene, the double bonds must migrate to form a conjugated system. This rearrangement is achieved under basic conditions via allylic deprotonation and subsequent reprotonation to form the more thermodynamically stable conjugated diene. A strong, non-nucleophilic base such as potassium tert-butoxide in a polar aprotic solvent like dimethyl sulfoxide is ideal for promoting this isomerization. Mild aqueous acid workups do not effect this isomerization, and oxidative or ozonolytic conditions would degrade or cleave the diene rather than isomerize it.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Birch reduction followed by mild aqueous acid workup gives the nonconjugated 1-methoxy-1,4-cyclohexadiene; no base-induced isomerization occurs. Does not yield the target conjugated diene.\n- B: Catalytic hydrogenation of benzene at 1 atmosphere does not efficiently reduce the aromatic ring; even if reduction occurred, it would not stop selectively at the diene stage.\n- C: Birch reduction ($Li/NH_3$, tert-butanol) to the 1,4-dihydro product, followed by base-induced isomerization with potassium tert-butoxide in dimethyl sulfoxide to form the conjugated 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. This matches the required two-step sequence.\n- D: Cold, dilute $KMnO_4$ effects syn-dihydroxylation of alkenes or oxidizes benzylic positions; it does not reduce aromatic rings to dienes. Not applicable.\n- E: Birch reduction followed by ozonolysis would cleave the double bonds, not isomerize them. Not applicable.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is lithium in liquid ammonia with tert-butanol, followed by potassium tert-butoxide in dimethyl sulfoxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2195348"}]}
