This first practice problem challenges you to predict the relative reactivity of several chlorobenzene derivatives toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution. By analyzing the electronic effects of different substituents on the aromatic ring, you will develop a core skill: identifying how activating and deactivating groups govern the speed of the S$_N$Ar reaction, which proceeds via an addition-elimination mechanism. This exercise lays the groundwork for planning successful syntheses and optimizing reaction conditions. [@problem_id:2185962]", "problem": "An organic chemist is planning the synthesis of several substituted phenols by reacting chlorobenzene derivatives with aqueous sodium hydroxide. This reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S$_N$Ar) mechanism. To optimize the reaction conditions for each synthesis, the chemist needs to predict the relative rates of reaction for the following three starting materials:\n\n- **Compound I**: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene\n- **Compound II**: 4-chloronitrobenzene\n- **Compound III**: 4-chloro-3-nitrotoluene\n\nArrange these three compounds in order of increasing reactivity toward aqueous sodium hydroxide. Select the correct ordering from the options below.\n\nA. I < II < III\nB. II < III < I\nC. III < I < II\nD. III < II < I\nE. II < I < III", "solution": "The reaction proceeds by the S$_N$Ar (addition-elimination) mechanism. The rate-determining step is nucleophilic addition to the aryl carbon bearing the leaving group to form the Meisenheimer intermediate. The stability of this anionic intermediate, and thus the rate, increases when there are strong electron-withdrawing groups that can delocalize and stabilize the negative charge, particularly when located ortho or para to the leaving group (through resonance). Multiple nitro groups further accelerate the reaction, while electron-donating groups at ortho or para positions destabilize the intermediate and decrease the rate.\n\nAnalyze each substrate relative to the chlorine leaving group:\n- Compound I (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene): It has two nitro groups, one ortho and one para to the leaving group. Both strongly stabilize the Meisenheimer intermediate via resonance and inductive effects. This gives the highest reactivity among the three.\n- Compound II (4-chloronitrobenzene): It has a single nitro group para to the leaving group, providing strong resonance stabilization of the intermediate. This is significantly activated, but less so than the dinitro derivative.\n- Compound III (4-chloro-3-nitrotoluene): In this molecule (systematically named 1-methyl-3-nitro-4-chlorobenzene), the leaving group is the chlorine at C-4. The nitro group is at the C-3 position, which is *meta* to the leaving group. A meta nitro group cannot stabilize the negative charge of the Meisenheimer intermediate through resonance; it provides only a weaker stabilizing inductive effect. Furthermore, the methyl group is at the C-1 position, which is *para* to the leaving group. The methyl group is electron-donating and actively destabilizes the anionic intermediate. The combination of a weakly activating meta-nitro group and a deactivating para-methyl group makes this compound the least reactive of the three.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing reactivity toward aqueous sodium hydroxide is:\nCompound III < Compound II < Compound I.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2185962"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of electronic activation, we now turn to a fascinating and often counter-intuitive aspect of the S$_N$Ar mechanism: the role of the halogen leaving group. While your experience with S$_N$1 and S$_N$2 reactions might suggest one trend, this problem reveals why the order of reactivity for halogens in S$_N$Ar is completely reversed. This exercise is key to grasping the importance of the rate-determining nucleophilic addition step and the stabilizing influence of electronegativity on the intermediate.

The planned reaction involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (NAS) using sodium methoxide ($CH_3ONa$) as the nucleophile and methanol as the solvent.

Two key effects apply:\n- The para $NO_{2}$ group stabilizes the negative charge in the $\\sigma$-complex by resonance, accelerating $k_{\\text{add}}$.\n- The halogen substituent influences the electrophilicity at the ipso carbon and the stability of the $\\sigma$-complex primarily through a strong inductive effect. A stronger $-I$ effect increases the polarization of the C–X bond, lowers the LUMO at the ipso carbon, and stabilizes the developing negative charge in the Meisenheimer intermediate, thereby lowering $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{add}}$.\n\nAmong halogens, the inductive effect magnitude follows:\n$$F > Cl > Br > I.$$\nConsequently, for NAS via addition-elimination, the rate order for aryl halides is:\n$$\\text{Ar-F} > \\text{Ar-Cl} > \\text{Ar-Br} > \\text{Ar-I}.$$\n\nAlthough $F^{-}$ is generally a poorer leaving group in aliphatic substitutions, in NAS the leaving-group departure is not rate-limiting; the dominant effect is the facilitation of the addition step by the strong $-I$ effect of fluorine. Thus, 4-fluoronitrobenzene (A) is expected to react the fastest under identical conditions to form 4-methoxynitrobenzene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2185926"}, {"introduction": "Not all nucleophilic aromatic substitutions follow the addition-elimination pathway. This final practice introduces a different set of conditions—a substrate lacking strong electron-withdrawing groups and the presence of a very powerful base.

Therefore, the reaction proceeds via the benzyne mechanism.\n\n2) Benzyne formation:\n- $NH_{2}^{-}$ abstracts an ortho proton relative to $Cl$ (at C2 or C6). This generates a carbanion adjacent to the carbon bearing $Cl$.\n- Elimination of $Cl^{-}$ from the carbanion produces a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2 (if C2 was deprotonated) or between C1 and C6 (if C6 was deprotonated). With a para $-CH_{3}$ substituent, these possibilities are symmetry-related and lead to the same set of products.\n\n3) Nucleophilic addition to benzyne and product regiochemistry:\n- $NH_{2}^{-}$ adds to either carbon of the benzyne triple bond.\n- Addition at C1 (the carbon that originally bore $Cl$) followed by protonation by $NH_{3}$ gives an $NH_{2}$ substituent at C1, with $CH_{3}$ at C4, i.e., p-toluidine (4-methylaniline).\n- Addition at the adjacent benzyne carbon (C2 or C6) followed by protonation gives an $NH_{2}$ substituent at C2 (or C6). Relative to $CH_{3}$ at C4, positions C2 and C6 are meta, giving m-toluidine (3-methylaniline).\n- No o-toluidine is formed in this mechanism because the $NH_{2}$ group can only be installed at the benzyne carbons (C1 and C2 or C1 and C6), which correspond to para or meta positions relative to the $CH_{3}$ at C4.\n\n4) Conclusion:\n- Under $NaNH_{2}/NH_{3}(l)$, p-chlorotoluene undergoes benzyne-mediated substitution to give a mixture of p-toluidine and m-toluidine.\n- Therefore, the correct choice is the mixture of p- and m-toluidine.\n\nHence, the major organic products are a mixture of p-toluidine and m-toluidine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2185950"}]}
