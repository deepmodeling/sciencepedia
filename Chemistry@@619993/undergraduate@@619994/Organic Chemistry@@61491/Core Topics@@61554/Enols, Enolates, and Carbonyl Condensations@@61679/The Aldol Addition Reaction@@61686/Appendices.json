{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The aldol reaction is a powerful tool for forming carbon-carbon bonds, and its success often hinges on understanding the factors that govern reactivity. This first exercise invites you to explore how the electronic nature of substituents on an aromatic aldehyde can either accelerate or decelerate its reaction with an enolate. By analyzing these effects, you will build a foundational understanding of how structure influences the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group, a key skill for predicting reaction outcomes and designing effective syntheses. [@problem_id:2207763]", "problem": "An organic chemist is studying the factors that influence the rate of crossed aldol addition reactions. In a series of experiments, acetone is treated with a base to form its enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile. This nucleophile is reacted separately with three different aromatic aldehydes. These aldehydes are: benzaldehyde (Compound I), p-chlorobenzaldehyde (Compound II), and p-tolualdehyde (Compound III). Assuming all other reaction conditions (temperature, concentration, solvent) are identical for the three experiments, arrange the three aldehydes in order of decreasing reactivity toward the acetone enolate.\n\nA) II > I > III\n\nB) III > I > II\n\nC) I > II > III\n\nD) I > III > II\n\nE) III > II > I", "solution": "The problem asks to determine the relative reactivity of three substituted benzaldehydes in a crossed aldol addition reaction where they act as electrophiles. The reactivity in this context is determined by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.\n\nStep 1: Identify the roles of the reactants.\nIn this crossed aldol addition, acetone is deprotonated by a base to form a nucleophilic enolate. The aromatic aldehydes (Compounds I, II, and III) serve as the electrophiles. The reaction rate is dependent on how susceptible the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde is to nucleophilic attack.\n\nStep 2: Relate reactivity to electrophilicity.\nThe carbonyl group is polarized, with a partial positive charge ($\\delta+$) on the carbon and a partial negative charge ($\\delta-$) on the oxygen. The rate of nucleophilic attack by the acetone enolate is directly proportional to the magnitude of the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. A larger partial positive charge makes the carbon more electrophilic and increases the reaction rate.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the electronic effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\nSubstituents on the benzene ring can modify the electron density at the carbonyl carbon through inductive and resonance effects.\n- Electron-donating groups (EDGs) increase the electron density in the aromatic ring and, consequently, at the carbonyl carbon. This reduces the partial positive charge, making the carbonyl less electrophilic and less reactive.\n- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decrease the electron density in the aromatic ring and pull electron density away from the carbonyl carbon. This increases the partial positive charge, making the carbonyl more electrophilic and more reactive.\n\nStep 4: Classify the substituents for each compound.\n- **Compound I (Benzaldehyde):** The substituent at the para position is a hydrogen atom (-H). This serves as the baseline or reference for comparing the effects of other groups.\n- **Compound II (p-Chlorobenzaldehyde):** The substituent at the para position is a chloro group (-Cl). Chlorine is highly electronegative, exerting a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect). It also possesses lone pairs that can be donated to the ring via resonance (+R effect). However, for halogens, the inductive effect is dominant. Thus, the chloro group is a net electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring in electrophilic aromatic substitution but, importantly for this problem, increases the electrophilicity of the attached carbonyl group.\n- **Compound III (p-Tolualdehyde):** The substituent at the para position is a methyl group (-CH$_{3}$). Alkyl groups are electron-donating through induction (+I effect) and hyperconjugation. This group increases the electron density in the ring and at the carbonyl carbon, reducing its electrophilicity.\n\nStep 5: Establish the order of reactivity.\n- **Compound II (p-chlorobenzaldehyde):** The electron-withdrawing -Cl group makes the carbonyl carbon the most electrophilic of the three. Therefore, it will be the most reactive.\n- **Compound III (p-tolualdehyde):** The electron-donating -CH$_{3}$ group makes the carbonyl carbon the least electrophilic of the three. Therefore, it will be the least reactive.\n- **Compound I (benzaldehyde):** With no strong donating or withdrawing group, its reactivity falls between that of Compound II and Compound III.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order of electrophilicity, and thus reactivity, is p-chlorobenzaldehyde > benzaldehyde > p-tolualdehyde. In terms of the given labels, this is II > I > III.

A poorly chosen base can react preferentially with the solvent instead of forming the desired enolate, leading to complete reaction failure. This practice problem uses acid-dissociation constants ($pK_a$) to diagnose a common experimental flaw, teaching you how to apply fundamental acid-base principles to select appropriate reaction conditions and avoid unintended side reactions. [@problem_id:2207811]", "problem": "A chemist is designing an experiment to synthesize an aldol addition product from butan-2-one. The proposed procedure involves dissolving butan-2-one in a large excess of absolute ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$) and then adding sodium amide ($NaNH_2$) to generate the necessary enolate. This experimental design is fundamentally flawed and will not proceed as intended.\n\nTo understand the flaw, consider the relevant acid-dissociation constants (pKa) for the species involved. The pKa of the alpha-protons of a typical ketone like butan-2-one is approximately 20. The pKa of ethanol is approximately 16. The pKa of ammonia ($NH_3$), the conjugate acid of the amide ion ($NH_2^-$), is approximately 38.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the principal chemical event that will occur upon mixing these reagents?\n\nA. The amide ion will act as a powerful nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one to form a stable tetrahedral intermediate.\n\nB. The amide ion will selectively and efficiently deprotonate the alpha-carbon of butan-2-one because ketones are intrinsically more reactive towards bases than alcohols are.\n\nC. The sodium amide and butan-2-one will fail to react because sodium amide is insoluble in ethanol, resulting in a non-reactive heterogeneous slurry.\n\nD. The amide ion will be almost entirely neutralized by the ethanol solvent in a rapid acid-base reaction, primarily yielding ammonia and sodium ethoxide.\n\nE. The butan-2-one, in the presence of a strong base, will preferentially undergo a self-condensation reaction via a pathway that does not involve enolate formation.", "solution": "Principle: In Brønsted acid-base reactions, the equilibrium favors formation of the weaker acid and weaker base. Using $pK_{a}$ values, the equilibrium constant for a proton transfer $B^{-} + HA \\rightleftharpoons HB + A^{-}$ is\n$$\nK \\approx 10^{pK_{a}(HB) - pK_{a}(HA)}.\n$$\nThe higher the $pK_{a}$, the weaker the acid.\n\nGiven $pK_{a}(CH_{3}CH_{2}OH) \\approx 16$, $pK_{a}(\\text{ketone } \\alpha\\text{-H}) \\approx 20$, and $pK_{a}(NH_{3}) \\approx 38$:\n\n1) Reaction of amide with ethanol (solvent, present in large excess):\n$$\nNH_{2}^{-} + CH_{3}CH_{2}OH \\longrightarrow NH_{3} + CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}.\n$$\nHere $HA = CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$ with $pK_{a} \\approx 16$ and $HB = NH_{3}$ with $pK_{a} \\approx 38$, so\n$$\nK \\approx 10^{38 - 16} = 10^{22},\n$$\nwhich is overwhelmingly product-favored.

However, because ethanol is both a stronger acid than the ketone $\\alpha$-C–H (lower $pK_{a}$ by 4 units) and present in large excess as the solvent, the kinetically and thermodynamically dominant process is deprotonation of ethanol. Practically all $NH_{2}^{-}$ is consumed by ethanol before significant ketone deprotonation can occur.\n\n3) After $NH_{2}^{-}$ is consumed, the base present is ethoxide. Ethoxide cannot efficiently generate the ketone enolate in ethanol:\n$$\nCH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-} + (\\text{ketone } \\alpha\\text{-H}) \\rightleftharpoons CH_{3}CH_{2}OH + (\\text{ketone enolate}),\n$$\nwith\n$$\nK \\approx 10^{16 - 20} = 10^{-4},\n$$\nwhich strongly favors the left side. Hence, enolate concentration remains negligible, and aldol addition will not proceed.\n\nAssessment of options:\n- A is incorrect: proton transfer to ethanol dominates; nucleophilic addition by $NH_{2}^{-}$ to the carbonyl is not the principal event.\n- B is incorrect: ethanol is more acidic than the ketone $\\alpha$-C–H, so $NH_{2}^{-}$ does not selectively deprotonate the ketone in ethanol.\n- C is incorrect: even if heterogeneous, the acid-base reaction between $NH_{2}^{-}$ and ethanol is extremely favorable and rapid; lack of solubility does not prevent reaction.\n- D is correct: $NH_{2}^{-}$ is essentially entirely quenched by ethanol to give $NH_{3}$ and $CH_{3}CH_{2}O^{-}$.\n- E is incorrect: aldol chemistry requires enolate (or equivalent) formation, which is suppressed; there is no alternative base-promoted self-condensation pathway that bypasses enolate formation here.\n\nTherefore, the principal chemical event is the neutralization of amide by ethanol to form ammonia and sodium ethoxide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2207811"}, {"introduction": "With a grasp of electrophilicity and reagent selection, we can now tackle more complex intramolecular aldol reactions.

The product is a cyclopentanol with the OH at C1 (former aldehyde) and an exocyclic ketone at C6 attached to ring carbon C5 as an acetyl substituent. This corresponds to 2-acetylcyclopentan-1-ol.\n- Enolate at C7 (the methyl side of the ketone): attack on the aldehyde C1 would require traversing C6–C5–C4–C3–C2 (five-atom tether), giving a seven-membered ring, which is disfavored relative to five-membered rings.\n- Enolate at C2 (alpha to the aldehyde): intramolecular attack on the ketone C6 closes a five-membered ring via the three-atom tether C3–C4–C5. The aldehyde remains intact as a formyl substituent on the ring (principal functional group), while the ketone is converted to a tertiary alcohol at the ring carbon that also bears a methyl substituent (from C7). Numbering the ring for a carbaldehyde (the ring carbon bearing the formyl is position 1), the adjacent ring carbon (position 2) bears both hydroxy and methyl substituents. This corresponds to 2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentane-1-carbaldehyde.\n\nCondition A (catalytic NaOH, heating): Enolate formation is reversible and under thermodynamic control, and cyclization favors the five-membered ring using the more substituted enolate at C5 and the more electrophilic aldehyde. Thus $P_{A}$ is 2-acetylcyclopentan-1-ol.\n\nCondition B (1.0 equivalent LDA in THF at low temperature, then aqueous workup): Irreversible kinetic deprotonation occurs at the most acidic, least hindered site, here alpha to the aldehyde (C2). The resulting aldehyde enolate undergoes intramolecular aldol addition to the less electrophilic ketone, but intramolecular five-membered ring formation is strongly favored; the aldehyde remains as the ring carbaldehyde, and the ketone becomes a tertiary alcohol bearing a methyl. Thus $P_{B}$ is 2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentane-1-carbaldehyde.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is $P_{A}=$ 2-acetylcyclopentan-1-ol and $P_{B}=$ 2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentane-1-carbaldehyde, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2207838"}]}
