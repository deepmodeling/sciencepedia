By resonance, this places significant positive charge density at the $\\beta$-carbon (the distal alkene carbon relative to the carbonyl, here carbon 4), making C4 electrophilic.\n\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack by methanol at the $\\beta$-carbon (C4) forms a C4–O bond, giving a conjugate addition intermediate in which the C3–C4 double bond is broken and the carbonyl remains activated.\n\nStep 3: Deprotonation of the methanol oxygen and subsequent keto–enol tautomerization restore the neutral ketone at C2 and yield the saturated ketone bearing methoxy at C4.\n\nMapping onto the pentan-2-one framework: the main chain remains pentan-2-one; carbon 4 bears both a methyl substituent (from the original 4-methyl) and the newly installed methoxy group.

This final practice delves into the stereochemical outcome of a conjugate addition on a substituted cyclohexane ring. By analyzing the approach of a Gilman reagent to 4-tert-butylcyclohex-2-enone, a molecule with a conformationally 'locked' ring due to the bulky group, you will learn how steric hindrance dictates the facial selectivity of the attack and leads to the formation of one major diastereomer [@problem_id:2162579].", "problem": "The reaction of 4-tert-butylcyclohex-2-enone with lithium dimethylcuprate, $(CH_3)_2\\text{CuLi}$, in diethyl ether, followed by a protonation step with aqueous acid ($\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$), yields a substituted cyclohexanone as the major product.

The dominant resonance form is the O-enolate with a C1= C2 double bond, so C2 remains trigonal (sp2) in the enolate. The only stereocenter set in the C–C bond-forming step is at C3.\n2) Protonation: Aqueous acid protonates the enolate oxygen to regenerate the C1=O, furnishing a saturated cyclohexanone bearing substituents at C3 (methyl) and C4 (tert-butyl). Because protonation occurs at oxygen, the configuration at C3 established during the addition is preserved.\n\nEstablish the preferred conformation and face selectivity:\n- The tert-butyl group at C4 strongly locks the ring in the chair conformation where the tert-butyl is equatorial (to avoid severe axial 1,3-diaxial strain).\n- In this locked chair, approach of the nucleophile to C3 occurs from the face opposite the bulky tert-butyl group to minimize steric interactions in the transition state. If the tert-butyl at C4 is equatorial up, the less hindered approach is from the down face at C3, which places the newly formed C3–CH3 bond on the down face.\n\nRelate approach direction to the final chair substituent orientations:\n- In the same locked chair, the equatorial direction at C3 is down. Thus attack from the down face gives an equatorial methyl at C3.\n- Therefore, the product places both substituents, C4–tert-butyl and C3–methyl, in equatorial positions (diequatorial). For adjacent substituents on a cyclohexane, the diequatorial arrangement corresponds to a trans relationship.\n\nExclude the alternatives:\n- 1,2-addition products (options C and D) are disfavored for cuprates, which strongly prefer 1,4-addition.\n- Option E is not an addition product.\n- The cis-3-methyl-4-tert-butylcyclohexanone (option B) would force one substituent axial in the locked chair, increasing 1,3-diaxial strain and making it less favorable than the trans diequatorial product.\n\nTherefore, the major product is trans-3-methyl-4-tert-butylcyclohexanone.\n\nHence, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2162579"}]}
