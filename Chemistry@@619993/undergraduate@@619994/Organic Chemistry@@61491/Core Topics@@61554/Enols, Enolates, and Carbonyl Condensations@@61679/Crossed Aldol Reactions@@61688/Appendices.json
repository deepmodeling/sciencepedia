{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The key to a successful crossed aldol reaction often lies in preventing self-condensation and ensuring one molecule acts as the nucleophile while the other acts as the electrophile. This first practice explores the most direct strategy: using a carbonyl compound that lacks $\\alpha$-hydrogens, thereby forcing it to act exclusively as an electrophile. By mastering this fundamental concept, you can predict the major product in a controlled aldol addition with confidence [@problem_id:2164524].", "problem": "A crossed aldol reaction is carried out under basic conditions (e.g., using NaOH in ethanol/water) between acetophenone and p-anisaldehyde. The reaction is carefully controlled at a low temperature to isolate the initial addition product before any subsequent dehydration can occur. Your task is to identify the correct chemical structure of this major aldol addition product from the choices provided below.\n\nThe structures are represented using the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES), a text-based notation for chemical species.

Acetophenone has alpha-hydrogens and forms its enolate under base (e.g., hydroxide), whereas p-anisaldehyde lacks alpha-hydrogens and therefore cannot form an enolate. Consequently, only acetophenone provides the enolate, and the electrophile is p-anisaldehyde.\n\nThe acetophenone enolate adds to the carbonyl carbon of p-anisaldehyde, forming a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha-carbon of acetophenone and the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The immediate product is a benzylic alkoxide adjacent to a ketone. Under the reaction conditions, this alkoxide is protonated to give the aldol addition product, a beta-hydroxy ketone.\n\nKey structural features of the major product:\n- The original ketone carbonyl remains on the acetophenone ring, so the carbonyl carbon is attached to an unsubstituted phenyl ring.\n- The new carbon-carbon bond connects the acetophenone alpha-carbon to the former carbonyl carbon of p-anisaldehyde.\n- The aldehyde carbonyl is converted into a secondary alcohol, which is beta to the ketone.\n- Low temperature and careful control prevent dehydration; therefore, the product is the beta-hydroxy ketone, not the conjugated enone.\n\nTranslating this into a connectivity description, the product has the skeleton: acetophenone-derived ketone $-$ methylene $-$ secondary alcohol $-$ p-anisyl ring, i.e., Ph$-$CO$-$CH$_{2}$–CH(OH)–Ar(OMe-p). In SMILES terms, this corresponds to O=C(c1ccccc1)CC(O)c1ccc(OC)cc1.\n\nAnalysis of the options:\n- A, O=C(c1ccccc1)C=Cc1ccc(OC)cc1, is the dehydrated enone (aldol condensation) product, not the isolated aldol addition product.\n- B, O=C(c1ccc(OC)cc1)CC(O)c1ccccc1, places the ketone carbonyl on the anisyl ring rather than on the acetophenone phenyl ring; this does not match the reaction outcome.\n- C, O=C(c1ccccc1)CC(O)(C)c1ccccc1, has a tertiary alcohol and lacks the anisyl methoxy group; it does not match the expected product.\n- D, O=C(c1ccccc1)CC(O)c1ccc(OC)cc1, exactly matches the beta-hydroxy ketone with the ketone carbonyl on the acetophenone ring and the secondary alcohol attached to the p-anisyl ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2164524"}, {"introduction": "When a ketone has two different $\\alpha$-positions, how do we control which one forms the enolate? This exercise delves into the concept of kinetic versus thermodynamic control in a directed aldol reaction. You will explore how specific reaction conditions, particularly the use of a strong, sterically hindered base like lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, enable the selective formation of the less-substituted (kinetic) enolate for a precise regiochemical outcome [@problem_id:2164503].", "problem": "In a laboratory synthesis, a chemist aims to perform a directed crossed aldol reaction. The procedure begins by dissolving 2-methylcyclohexanone in a suitable aprotic solvent and cooling the solution to -78 °C. Subsequently, one equivalent of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is added, and the mixture is stirred for a short period to ensure complete formation of the lithium enolate. Finally, an excess of acetaldehyde ($CH_3CHO$) is introduced into the reaction flask, followed by an aqueous workup to neutralize the mixture and isolate the product.\n\nAssuming the reaction proceeds under kinetic control, identify the major organic product formed in this sequence from the options below.\n\nA. 6-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nB. 2-(1-Hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one\n\nC. 1-Hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(propan-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nD. 2-Methyl-6-(2-methylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nE. 2-Methyl-6-ethylidenecyclohexan-1-one", "solution": "The substrate 2-methylcyclohexanone has two sets of acidic $\\alpha$-hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl at C1: at C2 (which bears a methyl substituent) and at C6 (the less substituted side). Under the stated directed aldol conditions—strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base (one equivalent of LDA), aprotic solvent, and low temperature—the deprotonation is irreversible and is governed by kinetic control. The kinetic enolate forms faster at the less substituted, more accessible $\\alpha$-position due to lower steric hindrance; therefore, LDA selectively removes an $\\alpha$-hydrogen at C6 to give the less substituted lithium enolate with $C1\\text{-}C6$ enolate formation.\n\nWith the preformed C6-enolate, addition of excess $\\mathrm{CH_{3}CHO}$ (acetaldehyde) ensures that the enolate reacts with the aldehyde rather than undergoing self-aldol reactions. The enolate carbon at C6 attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of acetaldehyde to form a new C–C bond, generating an alkoxide at the aldehyde oxygen (the aldolate). Subsequent aqueous workup protonates this alkoxide to furnish the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone. Regiochemically, this places a 1-hydroxyethyl group at C6 of the cyclohexanone ring, while the original methyl substituent remains at C2 and the ketone at C1. Thus, the product is the aldol addition product 6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\nAlternative options are disfavored under these conditions: formation via the more substituted (thermodynamic) enolate at C2 would lead to substitution at C2 (option B), but this requires thermodynamic control (higher temperature or less hindered base). Dehydration to the enone (option E) represents the aldol condensation product; under cold, directed aldol conditions with a simple aqueous workup, the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone is typically isolated rather than the dehydrated enone. The dimeric or unrelated structures in options C and D are inconsistent with the directed crossed aldol described.

This problem introduces a powerful strategy, enamine catalysis, to solve the challenge of a selective intramolecular aldol reaction where two different carbonyls are present. By temporarily converting the ketone into an enamine, we can precisely control its role as the nucleophile, directing its attack onto the more electrophilic aldehyde within the same molecule and demonstrating a sophisticated method for constructing cyclic systems [@problem_id:2164523].", "problem": "A synthetic organic chemist aims to synthesize a bicyclic precursor via an intramolecular aldol reaction starting from 5-oxohexanal. The desired reaction pathway involves the formation of a five-membered ring. This requires the enolate (or an enolate equivalent) derived from the ketone portion of the molecule to act as the nucleophile, attacking the aldehyde carbonyl group. However, the presence of two different carbonyl groups and multiple alpha-proton sites (at C-2, adjacent to the aldehyde, and at C-4 and C-6, adjacent to the ketone) presents a significant chemoselectivity challenge. A simple base like sodium hydroxide would lead to a mixture of products.\n\nWhich of the following reaction strategies would be the most effective and selective for achieving the desired intramolecular cyclization to form the five-membered ring intermediate?\n\nA.

Using a strong, non-hindered base such as sodium ethoxide ($NaOEt$) in ethanol at room temperature.\n\nE. Using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride ($NaBH_4$) followed by heating.", "solution": "The goal is to achieve an intramolecular aldol cyclization in which the nucleophile is the enol/enolate derived from the ketone portion, and the electrophile is the aldehyde carbonyl, giving the desired ring. The main challenge is chemoselective generation of the correct nucleophilic species in the presence of two different carbonyl groups and two distinct sets of alpha-protons that can be deprotonated to form enolates. Under simple base conditions, multiple enolates and competing inter- and intramolecular aldol reactions lead to mixtures.\n\nKey principles:\n- Relative acidity: alpha-protons next to an aldehyde are generally more acidic than those next to a ketone; in simple base deprotonations, this can lead to competing enolate formation. Denote acidity qualitatively by $pK_\\text{a}$; the aldehyde alpha $pK_\\text{a}$ is typically lower than the ketone alpha $pK_\\text{a}$.\n- Kinetic versus thermodynamic control: strong, non-nucleophilic bases like LDA at low temperature favor kinetic enolate formation but do not inherently guarantee site-selectivity when two different carbonyls are present; competition between more acidic (aldehyde alpha) and less hindered (ketone alpha) sites can still occur.\n- Enamine chemistry: a secondary amine can convert a ketone selectively into an enamine, which behaves as an enolate equivalent, while leaving the aldehyde as an electrophile. Intramolecular attack of the enamine on the aldehyde produces a cyclic iminium that hydrolyzes to the aldol product, enforcing both chemoselectivity and intramolecularity.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\nA. LDA at low temperature forms the kinetic enolate irreversibly, but site-selectivity is not ensured because the aldehyde alpha site is more acidic (lower $pK_\\text{a}$), whereas the ketone alpha site may be less hindered; both factors can compete. In addition, generating an aldehyde enolate can lead to undesired pathways, and mixtures are common without further control. This is not the most selective strategy to enforce reaction at the ketone-derived nucleophile only.\nB. Strong acid catalysis proceeds via enol (not enolate) chemistry. Protonation of the aldehyde increases its electrophilicity, but enolization can occur at either carbonyl, and competing intermolecular reactions and dehydration are common. This does not solve the chemoselectivity problem and often gives complex mixtures.\nC. Catalytic secondary amine (e.g., pyrrolidine) forms an enamine selectively with the ketone (ketones form enamines readily with secondary amines, whereas aldehydes tend to form imines/iminium species rather than stable enamines). The enamine is an enolate equivalent localized at the ketone portion, ensuring that the nucleophile is derived from the ketone exclusively. Intramolecular attack onto the aldehyde gives a cyclic iminium, which upon hydrolysis furnishes the aldol adduct. This strategy enforces both intramolecularity and chemoselectivity, and is a textbook solution to this problem.\nD. Sodium ethoxide in ethanol at ambient conditions generates an equilibrium mixture of enolates (thermodynamic control) and promotes both inter- and intramolecular aldol reactions, leading to mixtures without ensuring selective formation of the desired intermediate.\nE. Sodium borohydride reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, destroying the necessary electrophile for an aldol reaction and preventing the desired cyclization pathway; heating afterward does not restore the carbonyl needed for aldol formation.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and selective strategy to achieve the desired intramolecular aldol cyclization with the nucleophile derived specifically from the ketone is to employ enamine catalysis with a secondary amine, such as pyrrolidine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2164523"}]}
