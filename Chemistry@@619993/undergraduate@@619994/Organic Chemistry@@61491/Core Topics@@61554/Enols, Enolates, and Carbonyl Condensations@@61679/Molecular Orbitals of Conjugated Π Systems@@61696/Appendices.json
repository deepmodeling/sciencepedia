One of the species under investigation is the cyclopentadienyl cation, C₅H₅⁺. To predict its properties, the chemist considers the applicability of Hückel's criteria for aromaticity.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly classifies the cyclopentadienyl cation and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Aromatic, because it is a cyclic, planar, fully conjugated system with 4 π-electrons, which follows the 4n rule for aromaticity.\nB. Antiaromatic, because it is a cyclic, planar, fully conjugated system with 4 π-electrons, which follows the 4n rule for antiaromaticity (where n=1).\nC. Nonaromatic, because the molecule is not cyclic and planar, thus failing one of the primary criteria for aromaticity or antiaromaticity.\nD. Aromatic, because it has 5 π-electrons (one from each of the five carbons), which is an odd number, making it a stable radical cation.\nE. Nonaromatic, because as a charged species, it cannot be aromatic or antiaromatic, which are properties reserved for neutral molecules.\nF.

The $\\pi$-electron count proceeds as follows:\n- There are five $p$ orbitals around the ring (one per carbon).\n- The neutral cyclopentadienyl radical would have $5$ $\\pi$ electrons (one from each carbon).
