{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey into keto-enol tautomerism begins with a fundamental concept: acidity. The entire process hinges on the removal of a proton from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, the $\\alpha$-carbon, to form an enolate intermediate. This practice challenges you to identify the most acidic proton in a molecule by evaluating the stability of the resulting conjugate base, a critical skill for predicting reaction pathways [@problem_id:2181384]. Understanding which proton is most easily removed is the first step toward controlling the structure of the enol or enolate that forms.", "problem": "Consider the organic molecule 1-phenylpropan-2-one, which has the chemical structure $C_6H_5CH_2C(O)CH_3$. In this molecule, there are three distinct types of carbon-hydrogen bonds: those on the terminal methyl group (-CH₃), those on the methylene group (-CH₂-), and those on the aromatic phenyl group (-C₆H₅). The acidity of a hydrogen atom is determined by the stability of the conjugate base formed upon its removal as a proton (H⁺).\n\nWhich set of hydrogen atoms in 1-phenylpropan-2-one is the most acidic?\n\nA. The three hydrogens of the methyl group.\nB. The two hydrogens of the methylene group.\nC. The five hydrogens of the phenyl group.\nD. All non-aromatic hydrogens (methyl and methylene) are equally acidic.", "solution": "Principle: The relative acidity of hydrogens at different positions in an organic molecule is determined by the thermodynamic stability of the conjugate base formed upon deprotonation. Greater stabilization of the resulting anion (by resonance delocalization and inductive effects) corresponds to greater acidity.\n\nIdentify the three sets of C–H bonds in 1-phenylpropan-2-one ($C_6H_5CH_2C(O)CH_3$):\n- The terminal methyl group hydrogens on the carbonyl side (denote this site as the acyl methyl).\n- The methylene group hydrogens at the benzylic position adjacent to the carbonyl (alpha to the carbonyl and benzylic to the ring).\n- The aromatic phenyl ring hydrogens.\n\nAnalyze each conjugate base:\n1) Deprotonation at the acyl methyl (the $-C(O)CH_{3}$ end) yields an enolate. The negative charge is delocalized between the alpha carbon and the carbonyl oxygen via the standard two enolate resonance contributors. This resonance stabilization lowers the energy of the conjugate base relative to a simple alkyl carbanion, increasing acidity compared to nonactivated alkyl C–H bonds.\n\n2) Deprotonation at the benzylic methylene ($-CH_{2}-$ next to both the phenyl ring and the carbonyl) also yields an enolate. As with case (1), there are the standard two enolate resonance contributors that delocalize charge onto the carbonyl oxygen. In addition, because the deprotonated carbon is benzylic, the anionic character at the alpha carbon can further delocalize into the aromatic ring through additional resonance contributors (placing negative charge density at the ortho and para positions of the phenyl ring). Thus, this conjugate base is stabilized both by enolate resonance (carbonyl delocalization) and by benzylic resonance (aromatic delocalization). Having more extensive resonance delocalization than in case (1), it is more stabilized and therefore corresponds to greater acidity.\n\n3) Deprotonation at an aromatic C–H bond on the phenyl ring would give a phenyl carbanion. This anion is not effectively resonance-stabilized within the aromatic sextet without incurring loss of aromatic stabilization or placing the lone pair in an orbital that does not effectively overlap with the ring’s $\\pi$ system. Consequently, these hydrogens are far less acidic than alpha-to-carbonyl hydrogens.\n\nConclusion: The benzylic methylene hydrogens, being alpha to the carbonyl and benzylic to the aromatic ring, form the most stabilized conjugate base (enolate plus benzylic delocalization) and are therefore the most acidic. Hence, among the given options, the most acidic hydrogens are those of the methylene group.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2181384"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand that $\\alpha$-protons are acidic, the next question for an organic chemist is one of control, especially with unsymmetrical ketones. Can we selectively deprotonate one side of the carbonyl over the other? This exercise introduces the powerful concept of kinetic versus thermodynamic control in enolate formation [@problem_id:2181355].

The C1 position has three alpha hydrogens, and the C3 position has one alpha hydrogen.

CH₃I", "solution": "Goal: methylate 2-benzylcyclopentan-1-one at the less substituted alpha-carbon (the one not bearing the benzyl group). This requires formation of the kinetic enolate selectively, followed by alkylation.\n\nPrinciples:\n1) A ketone has two alpha positions. Here, one alpha-carbon is benzylic (more substituted) and the other is less substituted. The kinetic enolate forms faster at the less hindered alpha-carbon, whereas the thermodynamic enolate is the more substituted and more stable one.\n2) Kinetic control is achieved with a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base (e.g., LDA) in an aprotic solvent (e.g., THF) at low temperature (typically $-78\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), to favor the fastest deprotonation and prevent equilibration.\n3) Thermodynamic control is favored by weaker bases, protic solvents, higher temperatures, or conditions that allow enolate equilibration, leading to the more substituted enolate.\n4) After generating the enolate, methylation proceeds by SN2 with methyl iodide to give the C-alkylated product.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- Step 1 (enolate generation under kinetic control): Use LDA in THF at $-78\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. LDA, being a strong base, deprotonates the ketone irreversibly under these conditions. The acid-base driving force is large since $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}$ of diisopropylamine (the conjugate acid of LDA) is higher than that of the ketone alpha protons; the equilibrium constant satisfies $K=\\left(10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\mathrm{BH^{+}})-\\mathrm{p}K_{a}(\\mathrm{HA})}\\right)\\gg 1$, so enolate formation is strongly favored. Low temperature suppresses interconversion to the thermodynamic enolate. The deprotonation occurs faster at the less substituted alpha-carbon due to lower steric hindrance, giving the kinetic enolate positioned to install a methyl at C5.\n- Step 2 (alkylation): Treat the lithium enolate with CH3I. The enolate carbon attacks methyl iodide via SN2 at the methyl carbon, forming a new C–C bond and yielding 2-benzyl-5-methylcyclopentan-1-one.\n\nWhy other options are inferior:\n- A (NaOEt/EtOH, $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Protic solvent and weaker base promote enolate equilibration, favoring the thermodynamic enolate (more substituted), giving the wrong regioisomer and potential side reactions (aldol, O-alkylation).\n- B (NaH in THF, $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Strong base but not bulky; at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ equilibration can erode kinetic selectivity, leading to the thermodynamic enolate or mixtures.\n- D (LDA in THF, $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Higher temperature allows enolate equilibration, favoring the thermodynamic enolate; regioselectivity is lost.\n- E (t-BuOK in t-BuOH, $80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Protic solvent and high temperature strongly favor equilibration to the thermodynamic enolate and increase side reactions.\n\nTherefore, the set that most effectively and selectively delivers methylation at the less substituted alpha-carbon is LDA in THF at $-78\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ followed by CH3I.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2181387"}]}
