The standard two-step strategy is: (1) generate the ketone enolate cleanly and quantitatively with a strong, non-nucleophilic base in an aprotic solvent at low temperature to avoid side reactions such as aldol self-condensation, and (2) perform an $S_N2$ alkylation with a primary halide electrophile.\n\nKey principles:\n- A strong, non-nucleophilic base such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in an aprotic solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, THF) at low temperature produces the kinetic lithium enolate efficiently and suppresses competing aldol and O-alkylation pathways.\n- Allyl bromide is a primary, highly reactive $S_N2$ electrophile (allylic activation), minimizing elimination and favoring clean C-alkylation at the alpha carbon.\n- Protic solvents and weaker bases (e.g., sodium ethoxide in ethanol, aqueous sodium hydroxide) promote self-aldol condensation of cyclopentanone and do not generate high steady-state concentrations of the enolate needed for efficient alkylation. Water also quenches enolates and disfavors nucleophilic substitution on the alkyl halide.\n- The electrophile must match the desired product: allyl bromide is required to obtain the allyl substituent; propyl bromide would give the wrong product.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- A: Sodium ethoxide in ethanol is a weaker, nucleophilic base in a protic medium, which promotes aldol self-condensation and does not cleanly generate the enolate; significant side reactions expected. Not optimal.\n- B: LDA in THF at low temperature, followed by allyl bromide, is the textbook protocol: strong, non-nucleophilic base in aprotic solvent forms the enolate cleanly; allyl bromide then undergoes $S_N2$ to give 2-allylcyclopentanone in high yield with minimal side reactions.\n- C: Reagent order is incorrect; adding allyl bromide before base does not produce the enolate first, and aqueous NaOH will quench enolates and favor aldol processes rather than clean alkylation.\n- D: Correct base and solvent, but the electrophile is propyl bromide, which would furnish 2-propylcyclopentanone, not 2-allylcyclopentanone.\n- E: Aqueous NaOH is a protic, relatively weak base for enolate generation and promotes aldol side reactions; subsequent allylation is inefficient.\n\nTherefore, the most effective protocol is LDA in THF at low temperature followed by allyl bromide.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2167365"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simply choosing the right reagents, a chemist must also understand the quantitative aspects of a reaction.

The base is LDA and the alkylating agent is methyl iodide (MeI). The solvent is aprotic and the reaction is run at low temperature.\n\nStep 1 (stoichiometric enolate formation by a strong, non-nucleophilic base). LDA deprotonates the alpha position of $K$ in a $1:1$ stoichiometry:\n$$\nK + \\text{LDA} \\longrightarrow E + \\text{iPr}_{2}\\text{NH}.\n$$\nGiven $n_K=1.0$ mol and $n_{\\text{LDA}}=0.5$ mol, the maximum moles of $E$ formed are limited by LDA:\n$$\nn_E=\\min\\{n_K,n_{\\text{LDA}}\\}=0.5 \\text{ mol}, \\quad n_{K,\\text{remaining}}=1.0-0.5=0.5 \\text{ mol}.\n$$\nThis is consistent with acid-base strength: LDA is a much stronger base than diisopropylamine, so LDA effects essentially quantitative deprotonation up to its equivalence. The conjugate base left after this step ($\\text{iPr}_2\\text{NH}$) is too weak to further deprotonate $K$.\n\nStep 2 (C-alkylation of the lithium enolate with a primary alkyl iodide). The lithium enolate $E$ reacts with methyl iodide under $S_N2$ conditions to give C-alkylation as the major pathway for an unhindered primary halide:\n$$\nE + \\text{MeI} \\longrightarrow P + \\text{LiI}.\n$$\nBecause methyl iodide is added in excess, the extent of this step is limited by $n_E$, so\n$$\nn_P=n_E=0.5 \\text{ mol}.\n$$\n\nStep 3 (assessment of possible further alkylation). Formation of a second alpha-alkylation product (either 2,2-dimethylcyclopentanone or 2,5-dimethylcyclopentanone) would require generation of a new enolate from either $P$ or the remaining $K$. However:\n- All LDA has already been consumed in Step 1.\n- The only base present after Step 1 is diisopropylamine, which is too weak to deprotonate $K$ or $P$ to any significant extent in aprotic solvent at low temperature, since $pK_a(\\text{iPr}_2\\text{NH}_2^+) \\gg pK_a(\\text{ketone's } \\alpha\\text{-H})$.\n- Iodide is a poor base and cannot generate enolate.\nTherefore, no further enolate formation occurs, and no dialkylation occurs despite excess MeI.\n\nStep 4 (quench). Quenching neutralizes any residual reactive species but does not change the organic product distribution. Excluding solvent and byproducts from LDA or methyl iodide (such as diisopropylamine and lithium iodide), the major organic components are unreacted cyclopentanone $K$ and 2-methylcyclopentanone $P$.\n\nThus, the correct choice is the mixture of cyclopentanone and 2-methylcyclopentanone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2167373"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a chemical reaction is revealed when it is used to construct complex molecular architectures.

Specifically, for B, the distances between the enolate carbon (C7) and the anchor (C3) around the ring are $3$ and $2$, with tether length $2$, giving $[3.2.2]$; if the enolate were formed at C2, the short ring path between C2 and C3 has length $0$, leading to a fused system $[4.2.0]$, not the target. For C, the $\\alpha$-positions C2 and C7 are equivalently substituted, so LDA does not provide a clear kinetic selectivity; enolate at C2 would give $[4.2.1]$, whereas enolate at C7 would give $[3.2.2]$, leading to nonselective outcomes inconsistent with the stated selective formation of bicyclo[4.2.1]nonan-9-one.\n\nThus, only option A both provides the correct carbon count and, under kinetic enolate control, delivers the bicyclo[4.2.1] framework selectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2167328"}]}
