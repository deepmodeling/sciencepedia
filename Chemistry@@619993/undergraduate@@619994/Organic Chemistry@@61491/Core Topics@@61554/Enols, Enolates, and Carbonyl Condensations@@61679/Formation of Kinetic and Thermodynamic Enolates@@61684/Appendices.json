When working with unsymmetrical ketones, this often means controlling which alpha-proton is removed to form the enolate. This exercise challenges you to apply the core principles of kinetic versus thermodynamic control to select the ideal conditions for forming the *kinetic enolate*—the one that forms fastest—by considering the interplay of base strength, steric hindrance, and temperature [@problem_id:2171913].", "problem": "An organic chemist aims to perform a regioselective reaction starting with 2-methylcyclopentanone. The first step of the proposed synthesis requires the formation of an enolate intermediate by selectively removing a proton from the less substituted alpha-carbon. Which of the following sets of reagents and conditions is most suitable for achieving this specific deprotonation?\n\nA. Sodium ethoxide in ethanol at 25 °C\n\nB. Potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at -78 °C\n\nC. Aqueous sodium hydroxide at 100 °C\n\nD. Pyridine in dichloromethane at 0 °C", "solution": "The target is the enolate formed by deprotonation at the less substituted alpha-carbon of 2-methylcyclopentanone. This corresponds to kinetic enolate formation, which is governed by rate control rather than thermodynamic stability. The principles for selective kinetic deprotonation are: use a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base to abstract the most accessible proton rapidly, employ a polar aprotic solvent to solvate ions without promoting proton exchange, and maintain low temperature to suppress equilibration to the thermodynamic enolate.\n\nEvaluating the options using these criteria: Sodium ethoxide in ethanol is a smaller, less hindered base in a protic solvent and at moderate temperature; the conjugate acid ethanol promotes reversible proton transfers, favoring thermodynamic control rather than selective kinetic deprotonation, so A is unsuitable. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base; THF is an aprotic solvent; and low temperature favors kinetic control and suppresses equilibration, so B satisfies the requirements and will preferentially remove the less hindered alpha proton. Aqueous sodium hydroxide at elevated temperature provides a protic medium and high thermal energy that enhance equilibration and side reactions such as aldol processes, favoring thermodynamic rather than kinetic control, so C is unsuitable. Pyridine is a weak base that cannot generate a significant concentration of enolate from a ketone, so D is unsuitable.\n\nTherefore, the conditions that best achieve selective deprotonation at the less substituted alpha-carbon are potassium tert-butoxide in THF at low temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2171913"}, {"introduction": "While we often speak qualitatively about the 'thermodynamic' enolate being 'more stable,' it is crucial to understand what this means in quantitative terms.

Some molecules possess such rigid frameworks that they cannot achieve the necessary geometry for a reaction to occur, even if the electronic factors are favorable. This problem presents a fascinating case study with the bicyclic ketone fenchone, pushing you to consider how structural constraints, summarized by Bredt's rule, can override standard reactivity patterns and forbid enolate formation [@problem_id:2171869].", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the reactivity of fenchone, a rigid bicyclic ketone. The structure of fenchone consists of a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton with a carbonyl group at the C2 position. The bridgehead C1 position bears a methyl group and a single hydrogen atom. The C3 position is a quaternary center bearing two methyl groups.\n\nThe chemist attempts to generate an enolate from fenchone by treating it with a strong, non-nucleophilic base, Lithium Diisopropylamide (LDA), in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at low temperature. Consider the following statement about the expected outcome:\n\n\"Fenchone is readily deprotonated by LDA to form a stable enolate, which can then be trapped by an electrophile.\"\n\nEvaluate this statement and select the option below that provides the most accurate chemical reasoning.\n\nA. The statement is true. The alpha-proton at the C1 bridgehead is acidic due to the inductive effect of the adjacent carbonyl group, and its removal leads to a stable, planar enolate intermediate.\n\nB. The statement is false. The alpha-proton at the C1 bridgehead cannot be removed because the resulting carbanion would be located at a bridgehead position, which is inherently unstable due to its pyramidal geometry.\n\nC. The statement is false. The resonance-stabilized enolate cannot form because it would require a carbon-carbon double bond at the C1 bridgehead position, a configuration that is geometrically forbidden in this strained bicyclic system according to Bredt's rule.\n\nD. The statement is true. Deprotonation occurs, but at one of the methyl groups attached to C3. These protons are more sterically accessible and lead to the formation of a thermodynamically favored exocyclic enolate.\n\nE. The statement is false. Although the alpha-proton at C1 is acidic, the three methyl groups on the molecule create overwhelming steric hindrance that physically prevents the bulky LDA base from accessing the proton.", "solution": "We analyze enolate formation by deprotonation at an $\\alpha$-position to a ketone. The general mechanistic step is that a strong base $B^{-}$ removes an $\\alpha$-hydrogen to give an enolate, which is a resonance hybrid of a carbanion and an oxyanion:\n$$\n\\text{(i)}\\quad R-CO-CHR' \\xrightarrow{B^{-}} R-CO-CR'^{-} \\leftrightarrows R-C(=CR')-O^{-}.\n$$\nFor a valid enolate, the $\\pi$ bond between the carbonyl carbon and the $\\alpha$-carbon in the resonance form $R-C(=CR')-O^{-}$ must be able to adopt planarity and proper $p$-orbital overlap at both centers. In fenchone (a norbornanone-type framework, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one), the carbonyl is at C2; the $\\alpha$-carbons are C1 (a bridgehead) and C3 (a quaternary center).\n\nConsider deprotonation at C1. C1 bears a single hydrogen (an $\\alpha$-hydrogen) and is a bridgehead carbon. If this proton were abstracted, the enolate resonance demands formation of a $C1=C2$ double bond in the $R-C(=CR')-O^{-}$ representation. However, Bredt's rule dictates that in a small bridged bicyclic system such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead because the required trigonal planar geometry and $p$-orbital alignment at the bridgehead cannot be achieved. Therefore, the resonance-stabilized enolate that would require $C1=C2$ is geometrically forbidden. As a result, LDA does not produce a stable, trappable enolate via deprotonation at C1. This directly contradicts the claim that a stable, planar enolate forms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes planarity and enolate stabilization at the bridgehead; this is disallowed by Bredt's rule. Option B cites instability due to pyramidal geometry of a bridgehead carbanion; while poor conjugation at a bridgehead is an aspect, the most accurate and standard rationale is the geometric impossibility of the required bridgehead double bond for the enolate resonance structure, i.e., Bredt's rule. Option D is incorrect because C3 is a quaternary $\\alpha$-carbon with no $\\alpha$-hydrogens; removing protons from the methyl substituents on C3 yields a carbanion not conjugated to the carbonyl (not an enolate) and is not thermodynamically favored under LDA conditions. Option E is incorrect because steric hindrance by methyl groups is not the governing factor; the prohibition arises from geometric constraints on forming the enolate’s requisite $C=C$ at a bridgehead.\n\nTherefore, the statement that fenchone is readily deprotonated by LDA to give a stable enolate that can be trapped by an electrophile is false for the reason that the resonance-stabilized enolate would require a bridgehead double bond forbidden by Bredt’s rule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2171869"}]}
