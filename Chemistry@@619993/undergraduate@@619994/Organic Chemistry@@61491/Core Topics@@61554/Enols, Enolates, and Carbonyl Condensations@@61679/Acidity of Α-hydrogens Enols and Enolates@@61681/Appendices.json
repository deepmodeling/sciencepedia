These conditions favor the rate-controlled, less hindered deprotonation at C1, giving the kinetic enolate with high selectivity and suppressing equilibration to the thermodynamic enolate. This set best matches the requirement.\n- Potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol at $82^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ employs a bulky base but in a protic solvent and at elevated temperature, which promotes reversibility and equilibration, thus favoring thermodynamic control or giving mixtures.
