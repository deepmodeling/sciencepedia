The conjugated system involves carbons 1 through 4. Under strong protic acid, the initial step is electrophilic protonation at one of the ends of the conjugated system to generate an allylic carbocation. There are two possible pathways leading to two different allylic cations:\n\n1) Protonation at C1: The proton adds to C1, and the positive charge forms at C2. This generates a tertiary allylic carbocation, which is in resonance with a secondary carbocation at C4.\n- Cation at C2 (tertiary) with the C3=C4 double bond: CH3–C+(Me)–CH=CH–CH3.\n- After resonance, cation at C4 (secondary) with a C2=C3 double bond: CH3–C(Me)=CH–C+H–CH3.\nThe dominant contributor to this resonance hybrid is the tertiary carbocation at C2. The IUPAC name corresponding to this major resonance form is 2-methylpent-3-en-2-yl cation.\n\n2) Protonation at C4: The proton adds to C4, and the positive charge forms at C3. This generates a secondary allylic carbocation, which is in resonance with a primary carbocation at C1.\n- Cation at C3 (secondary) with the C1=C2 double bond: CH2=C(Me)–C+H–CH2–CH3.\n- After resonance, cation at C1 (primary) with a C2=C3 double bond: C+H2–C(Me)=CH–CH2–CH3.\nThe dominant contributor here is the secondary allylic carbocation at C3.\n\nCarbocation stability follows the order: tertiary allylic > secondary allylic > primary allylic.

The most stable intermediate is the resonance hybrid dominated by the 2-methylpent-3-en-2-yl cation structure.\n\nThe other listed options are incorrect: (E) is not allylic; (C) and (D) are not valid intermediates for this reaction; and (B) represents the less stable allylic cation formed via pathway 2.\n\nHence, the most stable allylic carbocation is best represented by the 2-methylpent-3-en-2-yl cation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2169005"}, {"introduction": "Once an allylic carbocation is formed, it can be attacked by a nucleophile at two different positions, leading to a competition between kinetic and thermodynamic control.

Using standard IUPAC numbering, the conjugated pi system involves carbons C2, C3, C4, and C5.\n\nStep 1: Electrophilic addition of $H^{+}$ to the conjugated system. Due to the molecule's symmetry, protonation at C2 is equivalent to protonation at C5. Let's consider protonation at C2. This forms a resonance-stabilized secondary allylic carbocation, with the positive charge delocalized between C3 and C5.\n- The resonance forms of the intermediate are: $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{C}^+\\text{H}-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{CH}_3$ and $\\text{CH}_3-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}=\\text{CH}-\\text{C}^+\\text{H}-\\text{CH}_3$.\n\nStep 2: Capture of the carbocation by the bromide ion ($\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$) can occur at either cationic center, leading to two constitutional isomers.\n- **1,2-addition:** The bromide ion attacks at C3.

This is the 1,4-addition product.\n\nStep 3: Distinguishing between kinetic and thermodynamic control.\n- Under **kinetic control** (low temperature), the reaction favors the product that forms fastest (i.e., has the lowest activation energy). For conjugated dienes, the 1,2-adduct is typically the kinetic product, partly due to the proximity of the nucleophile to the adjacent carbocation center. Thus, the kinetic product is (E)-4-bromohex-2-ene.\n- Under **thermodynamic control** (high temperature), the reaction is reversible and reaches equilibrium, favoring the most stable product. The 1,4-adduct, (E)-2-bromohex-3-ene, has its double bond in the center of the molecule. The 1,2-adduct, (E)-4-bromohex-2-ene, also has an internal double bond. In many such cases, the 1,4-product is found to be slightly more stable, making it the thermodynamic product. The E isomer is favored in both cases due to lower steric strain.\n\nTherefore:\n- Kinetic product: (E)-4-bromohex-2-ene.\n- Thermodynamic product: (E)-2-bromohex-3-ene.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2168990"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise asks you to think in reverse, a common task for a synthetic chemist.
