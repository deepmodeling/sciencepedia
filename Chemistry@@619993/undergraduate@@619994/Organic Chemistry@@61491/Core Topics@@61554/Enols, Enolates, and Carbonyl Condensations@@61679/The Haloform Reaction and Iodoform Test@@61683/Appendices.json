This practice challenges you to apply the mechanistic details of the haloform reaction to a more complex, sterically constrained substrate, camphor [@problem_id:2210680]. Analyzing this case will solidify your understanding of the non-negotiable structural requirement for an $\\alpha$-methyl group, preventing you from over-generalizing the reaction's scope.", "problem": "The haloform reaction is a characteristic reaction of methyl ketones (and compounds that can be oxidized to methyl ketones, such as secondary alcohols with the hydroxyl group on the second carbon). The reaction involves treating the substrate with an excess of a halogen (e.g., iodine, I₂), in the presence of a strong base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, NaOH), which results in the formation of a carboxylate salt and a haloform molecule (e.g., iodoform, $\\text{CHI}_3$).\n\nConsider the rigid bicyclic ketone camphor, whose systematic name is 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. The carbonyl group is at the C2 position, which is flanked by the bridgehead C1 position and the C3 position.\n\nBased on the mechanism and substrate requirements of the haloform reaction, determine whether camphor will give a positive test (i.e., undergo a haloform reaction).

Yes, camphor will undergo the haloform reaction because it is a ketone with accessible alpha-hydrogens at the C3 position.\n\nB. No, camphor will not undergo the haloform reaction because the gem-dimethyl group on the C7 bridge creates excessive steric hindrance that prevents the base from abstracting any alpha-hydrogens.\n\nC. No, camphor will not undergo the haloform reaction because it lacks a methyl group directly attached to the carbonyl carbon, making the formation of a trihalomethyl group impossible.\n\nD. Yes, camphor will undergo the haloform reaction because the alpha-hydrogen at the C1 bridgehead position is sufficiently acidic to be removed.\n\nE. No, camphor will not undergo the haloform reaction because the formation of an enolate intermediate involving the bridgehead carbon (C1) would violate Bredt's rule.", "solution": "The haloform reaction proceeds under base and halogen via the following general sequence: (i) deprotonation at an alpha position to form an enolate, (ii) alpha-halogenation, repeated until an alpha-methyl group $\\text{CH}_3$ is fully converted to $\\text{CX}_3$, and (iii) nucleophilic acyl substitution and C–C bond cleavage to give a carboxylate and haloform $\\text{HCX}_3$. A necessary structural requirement is a methyl group directly alpha to the carbonyl, i.e., a methyl ketone of the form $R\\text{-CO-CH}_3$ (or a precursor oxidizable to it).\n\nFor camphor (1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one), the carbonyl at C2 has two alpha positions: C1 (a bridgehead) and C3. Analyze each alpha site:\n\n1) At C1: This bridgehead carbon is quaternary due to bonding to three ring carbons and a methyl substituent, so it has no alpha-hydrogen to remove. Moreover, even hypothetically, formation of an enolate requiring a C1=C2 double bond would violate Bredt’s rule in this small bicyclic system, disfavoring such an enolate.\n\n2) At C3: This position bears alpha-hydrogen(s), so base can form the enolate with a C2=C3 double bond, and alpha-halogenation at C3 is possible. However, C3 is not a methyl group attached directly to the carbonyl; it does not have three hydrogens, so repeated halogenation cannot produce an alpha-trihalomethyl group $\\text{CX}_3$. Consequently, the characteristic cleavage step to give $\\text{HCX}_3$ (haloform) cannot occur.\n\nTherefore, camphor is not a methyl ketone and cannot form the requisite trihalomethyl intermediate; it will not give a positive haloform test. Among the options, the correct prediction and most accurate reasoning is that camphor lacks a methyl directly attached to the carbonyl, making trihalomethyl formation impossible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2210680"}, {"introduction": "In practice, chemists rarely rely on a single test; instead, they integrate data from various sources to solve a structural puzzle. This final exercise places the iodoform test into a realistic context of identifying an unknown compound [@problem_id:2210740].

This requires a methyl ketone functionality, i.e., a substrate of the form $R\\text{-CO-CH}_3$ (or a secondary alcohol of the form $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH(OH)-}R$ that is oxidized in situ to the corresponding methyl ketone). Because Compound A is subsequently reduced by $\\text{NaBH}_4$ to give alcohols, A must itself be a carbonyl compound (secondary alcohols are not reduced by $\\text{NaBH}_4$), so A is a methyl ketone:\n$$\n\\text{A} = R\\text{-CO-CH}_3.\n$$\nUnder the haloform conditions, a methyl ketone gives:\n$$\nR\\text{-CO-CH}_3 \\xrightarrow{I_2, \\text{base}} R\\text{COO}^- + \\text{CHI}_3.\n$$\nAcidification of the carboxylate yields $R\\text{COOH}$ (Compound B).

Reduction of a ketone creates a new stereocenter at the former carbonyl carbon. If the ketone has no pre-existing stereocenter, $\\text{NaBH}_4$ reduction gives a racemic pair of enantiomers. However, 3-methylpentan-2-one already contains a stereocenter at C-3 (the $\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)$ carbon), so reduction generates two stereoisomeric alcohols that are diastereomeric with respect to the existing stereocenter.
