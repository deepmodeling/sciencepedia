The stepwise reasoning is as follows.\n\n1) Under basic conditions (e.g., hydroxide), acetone undergoes deprotonation at its $\\alpha$-position to generate the enolate. This uses the principle that $\\alpha$-hydrogens of carbonyl compounds are acidic due to resonance stabilization of the resulting enolate.\n\n2) The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of acetone. This is nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl, forming a new C–C bond between the $\\alpha$-carbon of the enolate and the carbonyl carbon of the electrophile. After protonation of the alkoxide, the product of this aldol addition step is the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone known as 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one. This corresponds to option A, but it is the intermediate before dehydration.\n\n3) Upon gentle heating in basic medium, the $\\beta$-hydroxy ketone undergoes base-promoted dehydration (an E1cB-type elimination), in which the hydroxyl group and an adjacent $\\alpha$-hydrogen are removed to form a C=C bond conjugated with the carbonyl (driving force: formation of a conjugated enone). The double bond forms between the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-carbons relative to the ketone, yielding the $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone 4-methylpent-3-en-2-one (commonly known as mesityl oxide).\n\n4) Therefore, the major product of the self-aldol condensation of acetone under basic conditions with heat is 4-methylpent-3-en-2-one, which matches option B.

This practice challenges you to identify the starting material required to form a specific aldol addition product [@problem_id:2208039].

Careful quench before dehydration isolates this beta-hydroxyketone.\n\nThe named product, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, is a beta-hydroxyketone. Writing its condensed structure as CH3-CO-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH3 shows a ketone at C-2 and a tertiary alcohol at C-4 bearing a methyl substituent. A retro-aldol disconnection between the C-3 (the methylene next to the ketone) and C-4 (the carbinol carbon) regenerates two identical carbonyl fragments. Performing this disconnection on CH3-CO-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH3 yields two molecules of CH3-CO-CH3, i.e., propanone (acetone). This identifies the single ketone that, by self-aldol addition, gives the observed product.\n\nA carbon count cross-check supports this: a self-aldol addition of a ketone with $n$ carbons affords a beta-hydroxyketone with $2n$ carbons. The product has $6$ carbons (a pentanone backbone with one additional methyl substituent), so $2n=6$ and hence $n=3$. Among the options, the only $3$-carbon ketone is propanone. Options A and D are aldehydes (not ketones), and C (butan-2-one) or E (3-pentanone) would give $2n=8$ or $10$ carbons, respectively, which do not match the observed product.\n\nTherefore, the starting ketone is propanone.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2208039"}, {"introduction": "This advanced exercise moves beyond product prediction to a deeper mechanistic investigation using isotopic labeling.

This problem illuminates the dynamic and often reversible nature of reaction intermediates in an acidic aqueous environment, revealing how the solvent can play a crucial and active role in the reaction pathway.", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating the mechanism of the acid-catalyzed aldol condensation.

In an acid-catalyzed aldol condensation between acetophenone (as its enol) and benzaldehyde, the enol of acetophenone attacks the protonated benzaldehyde. In the aldol addition intermediate, the oxygen derived from the aldehyde carbonyl becomes the $\\beta$-hydroxy group. Upon dehydration, that hydroxyl is the leaving group (as water), and the $\\alpha,\\beta$-unsaturated ketone carbonyl oxygen comes from the acetophenone carbonyl. Therefore, in the absence of exchange, the benzaldehyde oxygen does not become the chalcone carbonyl oxygen. Hence option A is inconsistent with the intrinsic connectivity.\n\n2) Acid-catalyzed oxygen exchange with water. In acidic aqueous solution, aldehydes and ketones undergo rapid, reversible hydration and dehydration via protonation of the carbonyl and nucleophilic addition of water, followed by deprotonation. Denote the hydration equilibrium and exchange rate schematically as\n$$\n\\text{Ar-C}(^{18}\\text{O})\\text{H} \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} \\text{Ar-C}(\\text{OH})(\\text{OH}_2^+)\\text{H} \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-2}]{k_{2}} \\text{Ar-C}(^{16}\\text{O})\\text{H} + \\text{H}_2^{18}\\text{O},\n$$\nwhere water oxygens can swap between the carbonyl and solvent pool under catalytic acid. Even if the equilibrium constant for hydration, $K_\\text{hyd}$, is less than unity for benzaldehyde, repeated reversible steps over the reaction timescale lead to isotopic exchange of the carbonyl oxygen with the vast excess of solvent water.\n\n3) Dehydration step and the fate of the hydroxyl oxygen. In the $\\beta$-hydroxyketone intermediate, the hydroxyl oxygen originates from the benzaldehyde carbonyl oxygen. Under acidic conditions, this hydroxyl also exchanges with solvent through protonation and reversible substitution by water. The dehydration eliminates water composed of the $\\beta$-OH oxygen and a proton from the $\\alpha$-position or solvent. If no exchange occurred, the eliminated water would carry $^{18}\\text{O}$. However, because protonation and exchange steps occur repeatedly in bulk $\\text{H}_2^{16}\\text{O}$, the $\\beta$-OH oxygen also equilibrates with the solvent oxygen pool before elimination.\n\n4) Statistical distribution in a large solvent volume. Let $N_\\text{w}$ be the number of solvent water molecules. The single $^{18}\\text{O}$ atom initially present in benzaldehyde, after many exchange cycles, is randomized among the $N_\\text{w}$ solvent molecules and any exchangeable oxygen sites. The probability that the specific water molecule produced in the final dehydration carries the $^{18}\\text{O}$ is approximately $1/N_\\text{w}$, which is negligible for a large aqueous volume. Likewise, incorporation into the chalcone carbonyl would require exchange of the ketone oxygen with the solvent pool and then selection of the $^{18}\\text{O}$ from that pool, which again has probability on the order of $1/N_\\text{w}$ at any given incorporation event, and the product ketone oxygen initially derives from acetophenone, not benzaldehyde.\n\nFormally, if $x_{^{18}\\text{O}}$ denotes the mole fraction of $^{18}\\text{O}$ in the solvent oxygen pool after exchange, then for a single labeled atom dispersed in a large pool,\n$$\nx_{^{18}\\text{O}} \\approx \\frac{1}{N_\\text{w}} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad N_\\text{w} \\gg 1,\n$$\nso the predominant location of the label is within the bulk water, highly diluted among many water molecules. Consequently:\n- A is false because the chalcone carbonyl oxygen originates from acetophenone and also undergoes exchange that dilutes any $^{18}\\text{O}$.\n- B is false because the eliminated water is only one molecule among many and will not exclusively carry the label after exchange.\n- D is false because equal distribution between product carbonyl and byproduct water does not occur; the dominant sink is the bulk solvent.\n- E is false; there is no pathway under these conditions to oxidize and evolve $^{18}\\text{O}_2$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the $^{18}\\text{O}$ label is found primarily distributed within the bulk water solvent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2208029"}]}
