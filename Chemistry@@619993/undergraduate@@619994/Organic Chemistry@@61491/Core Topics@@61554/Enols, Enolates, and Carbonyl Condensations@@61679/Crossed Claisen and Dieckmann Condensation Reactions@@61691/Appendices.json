Sodium hydride ($\\text{NaH}$) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base that deprotonates an $\\alpha$-methylene next to an ester, generating an ester enolate. With one equivalent of $\\text{NaH}$, a single $\\alpha$-enolate is formed:\n$$\\text{EtOOC-CH}^-\\text{-(CH}_2)_3\\text{-COOEt} \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad \\text{enolate conjugate base}.$$\n\nThis enolate undergoes an intramolecular Claisen condensation (Dieckmann cyclization). The carbanion at the $\\alpha$-carbon attacks the carbonyl carbon of the distal ester, forming a new $\\text{C-C}$ bond and giving a cyclic tetrahedral intermediate, which then expels ethoxide ($\\text{EtO}^{-}$) to afford a cyclic $\\beta$-keto ester enolate. Protonation upon the $H_3O^+$ quench furnishes the neutral $\\beta$-keto ester.\n\nTo determine the ring size, let $x$ be the number of methylene units between the two ester carbonyl carbons.

The acidic workup ($H_3O^+$) serves only to protonate the enolate; no saponification or decarboxylation conditions are present, so the product is not a ketone (such as cyclopentanone) nor the diacid (adipic acid). A six-membered ring is not formed from a 1,6-diester; a 1,7-diester would be required for $r=6$.\n\nTherefore, the major product is ethyl 2-oxocyclopentane-1-carboxylate.\n\nAmong the options, this corresponds to:\nA.
