The goal is to identify an acyclic ketone with the molecular formula $\\mathrm{C_5H_{10}O}$ that, upon reaction with one equivalent of molecular bromine ($\\mathrm{Br_2}$) in an acidic aqueous solution, yields exclusively one unique monobrominated organic product.\n\nWhich of the following ketones satisfies this condition?\n\nA. 3-Pentanone\nB. 2-Pentanone\nC. 3-Methyl-2-butanone\nD. Pentanal\nE. 2,2-Dimethylpropanal", "solution": "The core principle governing this problem is the mechanism of acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of ketones. This reaction proceeds through an enol intermediate. The position of halogenation is the α-carbon, the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group. The number of possible unique monohalogenated products is determined by the number of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) α-carbons that bear hydrogen atoms. To obtain a single monobrominated product, the starting ketone must have only one type of enolizable α-proton. This occurs if the ketone is symmetric with respect to the carbonyl group, or if one of the α-carbons has no protons. We must analyze each option to see which one fits this criterion.\n\nLet's examine the structure of each compound listed:\n\n**A. 3-Pentanone**\nThe structure is CH₃-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\nThe α-carbons are the two -CH₂- groups at positions C2 and C4. Due to the plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, these two methylene groups are chemically equivalent. Enolization at C2 is indistinguishable from enolization at C4. Consequently, bromination at either α-position results in the same single product: 2-bromo-3-pentanone (which is identical to 4-bromo-3-pentanone). Therefore, 3-pentanone meets the specified condition.\n\n**B. 2-Pentanone**\nThe structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.\nThe α-carbons are at C1 (a -CH₃ group) and C3 (a -CH₂- group). These two positions are chemically non-equivalent. The C1 methyl protons are different from the C3 methylene protons. Reaction with bromine in acid can therefore lead to two different enol intermediates and subsequently two distinct monobrominated products: 1-bromo-2-pentanone and 3-bromo-2-pentanone. Thus, 2-pentanone does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**C. 3-Methyl-2-butanone**\nThe structure is (CH₃)₂CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\nThe α-carbons are at C1 (a -CH₃ group) and C3 (a -CH- group, or methine). These two positions are clearly chemically non-equivalent. Bromination can occur on the methyl group or the methine group, leading to two different products: 1-bromo-3-methyl-2-butanone and 3-bromo-3-methyl-2-butanone. Thus, 3-methyl-2-butanone does not satisfy the condition.\n\n**D. Pentanal**\nThe structure is CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂-CHO. This is an aldehyde, not a ketone. The problem explicitly asks for a ketone. Therefore, this option is incorrect based on the definition of the starting material. (Although it is true that pentanal only has one α-position with protons and would give a single product, it does not fit the ketone requirement).\n\n**E. 2,2-Dimethylpropanal**\nThe structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. This is also an aldehyde, not a ketone, so it is an invalid choice. Furthermore, its α-carbon is a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms. It has no enolizable protons and thus cannot undergo α-halogenation under these conditions.\n\nBased on the analysis, only 3-pentanone is an acyclic 5-carbon ketone that possesses only one type of chemically equivalent α-proton, leading to the formation of a single monobrominated product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2215988"}, {"introduction": "Moving from acidic to basic conditions drastically changes the character of α-halogenation. This exercise introduces the haloform reaction, a powerful transformation that serves as a classic qualitative test for methyl ketones [@problem_id:2215992]. Your task is to analyze a ketone's structure and predict the visible outcome of this test, bridging the gap between molecular structure and laboratory observation.", "problem": "In an organic chemistry laboratory, a standard qualitative test is performed to detect the presence of specific structural motifs in aldehydes and ketones. The procedure involves treating the compound with an excess of iodine ($\\mathrm{I_2}$) in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide ($\\mathrm{NaOH}$).

You are tasked with predicting the outcome of this test for this specific compound.

The test will be positive because the molecule is a methyl ketone, allowing for exhaustive iodination at the methyl group followed by cleavage to form triiodomethane.\nB. The test will be negative because the bulky tert-butyl group introduces significant steric hindrance, preventing the hydroxide base from deprotonating any α-protons.\nC. The test will be negative because the molecule lacks α-protons on the carbon adjacent to the tert-butyl group, and the reaction cannot be initiated.\nD. The test will be positive, but the reaction will stop after a single iodination at the methyl group, as the introduction of a large iodine atom prevents further reaction.\nE. The test will be inconclusive because under these basic conditions, the ketone will preferentially undergo a self-aldol condensation reaction, consuming the starting material before halogenation can occur.", "solution": "Identify the structure and the positions of possible $\\alpha$-hydrogens. The given ketone, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone, is $\\mathrm{(CH_3)_3C-CO-CH_3}$ (tert-butyl methyl ketone). The carbonyl is flanked by a tert-butyl group on one side and a methyl group on the other.

The iodoform (haloform) reaction under $\\mathrm{I_2}/\\mathrm{NaOH}$ is characteristic of methyl ketones $\\mathrm{R-CO-CH_3}$.
