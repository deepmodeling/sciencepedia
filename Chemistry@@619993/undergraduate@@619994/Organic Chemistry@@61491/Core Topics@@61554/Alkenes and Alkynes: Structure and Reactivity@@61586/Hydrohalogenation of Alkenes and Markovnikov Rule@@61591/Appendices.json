This problem challenges you to reverse this process: by knowing the final product of a hydrohalogenation reaction, you must deduce the structure of the starting alkene. Successfully solving this requires a firm grasp of Markovnikov's rule, as the product's structure is a direct consequence of the formation of the most stable possible carbocation intermediate.

The reaction yields a single major organic product, which is identified as 2-chloro-2-methylbutane. Based on this outcome, identify the structure of the original alkene from the choices below.\n\nA. 2-methyl-2-butene\nB. 1-pentene\nC. (E)-2-pentene\nD. Cyclopentane\nE. 3-methyl-1-butene", "solution": "The molecular formula $\\text{C}_{5}\\text{H}_{10}$ is consistent with either an alkene (one degree of unsaturation) or a cycloalkane. The reaction described is electrophilic addition of $\\text{HCl}$, which proceeds with alkenes via a carbocation mechanism and follows Markovnikov orientation: the proton adds to the double-bond carbon that leads to the more substituted (more stable) carbocation. Carbocation stability follows the order tertiary $>$ secondary $>$ primary, so formation of a tertiary carbocation is strongly favored, and the major product will reflect that.\n\nThe observed product is 2-chloro-2-methylbutane, a tertiary chloride. This implies that the key intermediate was a tertiary carbocation located at the carbon that becomes substituted by chlorine.\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\n- A. 2-methyl-2-butene. Its double bond is between the substituted internal carbon and an adjacent carbon. Protonation according to Markovnikov adds $\\text{H}^{+}$ to the less substituted alkene carbon, generating a tertiary carbocation at the more substituted carbon (the one bearing two methyl groups and an ethyl group). Subsequent attack by $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ at that tertiary center gives exactly 2-chloro-2-methylbutane. This pathway gives a single major product without requiring any rearrangement.\n\n- B. 1-pentene. Markovnikov addition yields 2-chloropentane (from a secondary carbocation), not 2-chloro-2-methylbutane, so this is inconsistent.\n\n- C. (E)-2-pentene. Addition of $\\text{HCl}$ can give 2-chloropentane and/or 3-chloropentane via secondary carbocations; it does not give 2-chloro-2-methylbutane, so this is inconsistent.\n\n- D. Cyclopentane. This is not an alkene and does not undergo electrophilic addition of $\\text{HCl}$ under these conditions; it is incompatible with the stated reaction.\n\n- E. 3-methyl-1-butene. Markovnikov protonation initially forms a secondary carbocation. A 1,2-hydride shift can rearrange this to a tertiary carbocation that would also lead to 2-chloro-2-methylbutane upon $\\text{Cl}^{-}$ attack. However, this route involves rearrangement and typically gives a mixture including unrearranged products, whereas option A furnishes the observed product directly and cleanly as the single major product expected from carbocation stability without competing regioisomers.\n\nTherefore, the alkene that directly and uniquely accounts for the observed major product is 2-methyl-2-butene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2176186"}, {"introduction": "Markovnikov's rule accurately predicts the initial site of protonation, but the story doesn't always end there. This exercise demonstrates a critical feature of carbocation chemistry: the possibility of rearrangement.

Carbon-3 is a tertiary center bearing two methyl groups.\n\nState the governing principle. In an inert solvent and in the absence of peroxides, addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes proceeds via an electrophilic addition mechanism that follows Markovnikovâ€™s rule: protonation of the double bond forms the more stable carbocation intermediate, which is then trapped by the halide anion.\n\nAnalyze the initial protonation step. Protonation can occur at either vinylic carbon:\n- Protonation at C1 (the terminal carbon) places the positive charge on C2, forming a secondary carbocation: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}^+\\text{-CH(CH}_3\\text{)}_2$.\n- Protonation at C2 places the positive charge on C1, forming a primary carbocation: $\\text{CH}_2^+\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-CH(CH}_3\\text{)}_2$.\n\nBy carbocation stability considerations (tertiary more stable than secondary, which is more stable than primary), the pathway forming the secondary carbocation at C2 is preferred over the primary carbocation at C1.\n\nEvaluate possible rearrangements. The secondary carbocation at C2 is adjacent to C3, which bears a hydrogen. A 1,2-hydride shift from C3 to C2 transforms the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C3: $\\text{CH}_3\\text{-CH}_2\\text{-C}^+\\text{(CH}_3\\text{)}_2$.\n\nNucleophilic capture.

Number the chain to give the lowest possible locants to substituents; numbering from the end closer to the substituted carbon places both substituents at C2. The substituents are iodo and methyl, both at carbon 2. Therefore, the complete IUPAC name of the major product is 2-iodo-2-methylbutane.\n\nConclusion.
