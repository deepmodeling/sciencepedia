A foundational rule, yet a common point of error for students, is identifying the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the principal functional group—in this case, the alkene double bond. This practice problem [@problem_id:2203971] directly addresses this challenge, forcing you to look beyond the most obvious linear chain and correctly apply the parent chain rule in the presence of branching.", "problem": "An undergraduate student is synthesizing a series of branched alkenes. In their lab notebook, they propose the name \"4-propyl-2-hexene\" for one of their target products. However, upon review, a senior chemist points out that this name is incorrect because it does not follow the systematic naming rules established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).\n\nAssuming the student drew the intended molecular structure correctly based on their proposed name, what is the correct IUPAC name for this compound?\n\nA. 4-propyl-2-hexene\n\nB. 4-ethyl-2-heptene\n\nC. 3-ethyl-4-heptene\n\nD. 4-propyl-3-hexene\n\nE. 5-propyl-4-heptene", "solution": "Interpret the student’s proposed name as the intended structure: a hexene backbone with the double bond between C2 and C3, and an n-propyl substituent at C4. Represent the connectivity as a six-carbon chain $1-2=3-4-5-6$ with a three-carbon branch attached at C4.\n\nApply IUPAC rules:\n- The parent chain must be the longest chain containing the double bond. Tracing from C1 through the double bond and then through the branch gives a seven-carbon chain: $1-2=3-4-a-b-c$, where $a-b-c$ are the propyl carbons attached to C4. This yields a heptene parent rather than a hexene.\n- Number the parent chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the end that places the double bond at C2 gives hept-2-ene; the reverse direction would give hept-5-ene, which is not preferred.\n- Identify substituents not included in the parent chain. The two-carbon fragment $5-6$ (from the original hexyl chain beyond C4) becomes an ethyl substituent attached at carbon 4 of the hept-2-ene chain.\n\nThus, the correct IUPAC name is 4-ethyl-2-heptene, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2203971"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond naming a given structure, a key skill in organic chemistry is the ability to deduce a structure from a set of specific criteria. This exercise [@problem_id:2203986] presents a structural puzzle that requires you to integrate several distinct concepts: the index of hydrogen deficiency, the definition of a quaternary carbon, and the conditions for geometric ($E/Z$) isomerism. By systematically applying these constraints, you will construct a unique alkene isomer and then apply your nomenclature skills to name it correctly.", "problem": "An unknown hydrocarbon is isolated and analyzed. Elemental analysis reveals its molecular formula to be $C_6H_{12}$. Further structural elucidation is required to determine its precise structure. You are tasked with identifying the specific constitutional isomer that meets a set of specific criteria. A constitutional isomer is one of two or more compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas.\n\nUsing the rules set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), determine the systematic name of the specific acyclic alkene isomer of $C_6H_{12}$ that satisfies both of the following conditions:\n1. The molecule must contain one and only one quaternary carbon atom. A quaternary carbon is a carbon atom that is bonded to four other carbon atoms.\n2. The molecule must not exhibit E/Z (geometric) isomerism. A double bond exhibits E/Z isomerism if each of its two carbon atoms is bonded to two different groups.\n\nProvide the complete IUPAC name for this unique molecule.", "solution": "The molecular formula $C_{6}H_{12}$ has an index of hydrogen deficiency\n$$\\text{DU}=\\frac{2C+2-H}{2}=\\frac{2\\cdot 6+2-12}{2}=1,$$\nso the compound has exactly one double bond (acyclic as required).\n\nTo eliminate E/Z isomerism, at least one alkene carbon must bear two identical substituents. For hydrocarbons, the straightforward way is to use a terminal double bond, i.e., a $=\\text{CH}_2$ group, because one vinylic carbon then has two identical hydrogens and cannot be stereogenic about the double bond.\n\nThe structure must also contain one and only one quaternary carbon (sp3 carbon bonded to four carbons). Let the quaternary carbon be part of the carbon skeleton and adjacent (via a single bond) to the internal vinylic carbon of the terminal alkene. Counting carbons:\n$$N=6=1\\ \\text{(quaternary center)}+2\\ \\text{(the two vinylic carbons of the terminal alkene)}+k,$$\nhence $k=3$. These $k=3$ carbons must be distributed as three separate one-carbon substituents on the quaternary center, i.e., three methyl groups. Any attempt to replace one of these with an ethyl (or to interpose an extra methylene between the quaternary center and the alkene) would increase the total carbon count beyond six. Therefore, the unique feasible connectivity is the tert-butyl group attached to the internal carbon of a terminal alkene, namely $(\\text{CH}_3)_3\\text{C-CH=CH}_2$.\n\nThis molecule has exactly one quaternary carbon (the central carbon bonded to three methyls and the vinylic carbon), and the double bond is terminal, so it does not exhibit E/Z isomerism. The longest chain containing the double bond has four carbons; numbering from the terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ gives the double bond at carbon 1 and two methyl substituents at carbon 3. By IUPAC rules, the name is 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene.\n\nNo other acyclic $C_{6}H_{12}$ alkene can simultaneously contain exactly one quaternary carbon and avoid E/Z isomerism without exceeding six carbons or losing the quaternary center, so this structure is unique under the stated conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene}}$$", "id": "2203986"}, {"introduction": "The principles of structure and nomenclature are not just academic exercises; they are vital tools for a practicing chemist.

For $n=8$, this is $\\text{C}_{8}\\text{H}_{14}$, consistent with bicyclo[2.2.2]octane.\n\nSince Compound X has $\\text{IHD}=4$ and upon complete hydrogenation becomes a compound with $\\text{IHD}=2$, the difference of $2$ must correspond to two double bonds that are removed by hydrogenation. Therefore, Compound X must be a diene embedded in the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework; hydrogenation removes the two double bonds but preserves the bicyclic skeleton, giving bicyclo[2.2.2]octane as a single product.\n\nAmong the options, only names that denote the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton are candidates: these are bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,5-diene and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,7-diene (options B and E). In the highly symmetric bicyclo[2.2.2] framework, these denote the same structural motif of two double bonds in two of the equivalent bridges; by IUPAC rules, numbering is chosen to give the lowest set of locants, making 2,5 preferred over 2,7. Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,5-diene.\n\nThe other options feature different ring systems ([3.2.1], spiro[3.4], [4.2.0]) that would hydrogenate to saturated frameworks distinct from bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, so they are not compatible with the given outcome.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2203985"}]}
