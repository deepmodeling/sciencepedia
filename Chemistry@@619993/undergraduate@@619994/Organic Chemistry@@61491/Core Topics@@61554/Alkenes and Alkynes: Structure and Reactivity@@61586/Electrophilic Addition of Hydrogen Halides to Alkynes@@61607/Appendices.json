The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n\nApply the governing principle: Addition of a hydrogen halide ($HX$) to an alkyne proceeds via electrophilic addition. In the absence of peroxides, $HCl$ adds in a Markovnikov fashion. With one equivalent of $HX$, the reaction stops at the vinyl halide stage rather than proceeding to the geminal dihalide (which would require excess $HX$ and/or more forcing conditions).\n\nDetail the stepwise mechanism and regiochemistry:\n- Protonation of the alkyne forms a vinyl cation. The regioselective step follows Markovnikov’s rule: the proton adds to the terminal carbon (C1), generating the more substituted and more stable vinylic carbocation at C2.\n- The chloride anion then attacks the cationic carbon (C2), forming a C-Cl bond. The resulting double bond remains between C1 and C2.\n\nRelate to the product structure and naming: The product is the corresponding vinyl chloride with the double bond at the C1–C2 position and the chlorine atom at C2. The IUPAC name is 2-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene. Stereochemistry at the alkene (E/Z) is not controlled in this ionic addition and a mixture is typically formed; therefore, the option that does not specify stereochemistry is appropriate.\n\nExclude other options:\n- (E)-1-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene places Cl at C1 (anti-Markovnikov) and specifies a single stereoisomer; both are inconsistent.\n- 2,2-dichloro-4-methylpentane requires addition of two equivalents of $HCl$ to form a geminal dihalide.\n- 4-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene and 3-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene do not arise from direct Markovnikov addition to the alkyne.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-chloro-4-methyl-1-pentene.\n\nThus, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2168463"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple prediction, this problem challenges you to think like a synthetic chemist working backward from a known product.

The substrate is 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentyne, an unsymmetrical internal alkyne. The reagent is exactly one equivalent of hydrogen bromide ($HBr$) under ionic (polar) conditions. The reaction is electrophilic addition of $HX$ to an alkyne.\n\nState the general mechanistic principle. Under ionic conditions, addition of $HX$ to an alkyne proceeds by initial electrophilic protonation of the triple bond to generate a vinylic carbocation, followed by nucleophilic capture by the halide. For an unsymmetrical internal alkyne $R^{1}C\\equiv CR^{2}$, both orientations of protonation are possible, leading to two regioisomeric vinylic cations and thus to two regioisomeric vinyl halides. The process is not stereospecific; both syn and anti additions can occur, leading to both $E$ and $Z$ alkenyl halides.\n\nApply regiochemistry to the given alkyne. Label the alkyne carbons as $C2\\equiv C3$ in 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentyne. Protonation can occur at $C2$ or at $C3$:\n- Protonation at $C2$ places a positive charge at $C3$.\n- Protonation at $C3$ places a positive charge at $C2$.\nBecause both possible secondary vinylic carbocations are of similar stability, both are formed, leading to two regiochemical outcomes: bromine at $C2$ (giving 2-bromo-4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene) and bromine at $C3$ (giving 3-bromo-4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene).\n\nAddress stereochemistry. Formation of the vinylic cation followed by capture by the bromide ion ($\\text{Br}^-$) is stepwise and not stereospecific.
