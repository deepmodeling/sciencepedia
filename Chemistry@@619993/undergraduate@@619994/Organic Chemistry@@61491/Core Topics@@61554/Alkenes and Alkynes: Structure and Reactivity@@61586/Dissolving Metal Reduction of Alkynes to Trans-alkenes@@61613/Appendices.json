{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A core skill in synthetic organic chemistry is the ability to work backward from a desired product to a suitable starting material, a process known as retrosynthesis. This first exercise challenges you to apply this thinking to the dissolving metal reduction. Given a specific *trans*-alkene as the target, you must identify the alkyne precursor that would yield this product, reinforcing the key principle that this reduction cleanly converts an alkyne's triple bond into a *trans* (*E*) double bond without altering its position in the carbon chain [@problem_id:2167728].", "problem": "An organic chemist is tasked with synthesizing a specific alkene for a subsequent reaction. The target molecule is (E)-4-octene. The chemist decides to use a dissolving metal reduction, a classic method for this type of transformation, employing sodium metal (Na) in liquid ammonia ($NH_3$) as the solvent and proton source. The reaction proceeds cleanly, yielding (E)-4-octene as the only major organic product. Based on this outcome, identify the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name of the single alkyne that was used as the starting material.\n\nA. 3-Octyne\n\nB. 3-Heptyne\n\nC. 4-Octyne\n\nD. 1-Octyne\n\nE. (Z)-4-Octene", "solution": "The key reaction principle is the dissolving metal reduction of alkynes using sodium in liquid ammonia. This transformation proceeds via stepwise single-electron transfer and protonation steps that effect anti addition of two hydrogen atoms across the carbon–carbon triple bond, producing a trans-alkene. Therefore, $Na/NH_3$ reduces an internal alkyne to the corresponding trans (E) alkene without shifting the position of the multiple bond. A terminal alkyne would give a terminal alkene, which does not exhibit E/Z stereochemistry.\n\nThe target product is (E)-4-octene. This alkene has a double bond between C4 and C5 in an eight-carbon chain, with trans geometry. Hence, the precursor alkyne must be an internal alkyne with the triple bond between C4 and C5, so that anti addition gives the trans alkene at the same position. That starting material is 4-octyne.\n\nChecking the options:\n- 3-Octyne would reduce to (E)-3-octene, not (E)-4-octene.\n- 3-Heptyne has seven carbons, not eight.\n- 4-Octyne reduces to (E)-4-octene, matching the product.\n- 1-Octyne would give 1-octene, which does not have E/Z stereochemistry.\n- (Z)-4-Octene is not an alkyne and cannot be the starting material.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name of the starting alkyne is 4-octyne, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2167728"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, we now move from identifying a reactant to predicting a product. This practice asks you to determine the outcome when an unsymmetrical internal alkyne undergoes reduction with an alkali metal in liquid ammonia. Successfully solving this problem requires not only applying the rule of *anti*-addition but also correctly assigning the stereochemical descriptor (*E* or *Z*) to the resulting alkene using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, a crucial skill for describing molecular geometry [@problem_id:2167723].", "problem": "An organic chemist is investigating stereoselective reductions. A reaction is set up by dissolving the internal alkyne 5-methyl-2-hexyne in a flask containing liquid ammonia as the solvent. Small pieces of potassium metal are then added to the solution, causing a characteristic blue color to appear and then fade as the reaction proceeds. Once the reaction is complete and has been appropriately worked up to isolate the neutral organic compound, what is the correct International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for the major organic product formed?\n\nSelect the correct option from the choices below.\n\nA. (*E*)-5-Methyl-2-hexene\n\nB. (*Z*)-5-Methyl-2-hexene\n\nC. 5-Methylhexane\n\nD. (*E*)-5-Methyl-3-hexene\n\nE. 5-Methyl-2-hexyne", "solution": "The starting material, 5-methyl-2-hexyne, is an internal alkyne with the structure $CH_3-C\\equiv C-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2$, where the triple bond is between C2 and C3 and there is a methyl substituent at C5. The reaction conditions are potassium metal in liquid ammonia. These conditions generate solvated electrons in $NH_3(l)$ (blue solution), and this is the classic dissolving metal reduction of alkynes, which stereoselectively gives the trans-alkene via anti addition of hydrogen.\n\nMechanistic sequence:\n1. Single-electron transfer from solvated $e^-$ to the alkyne gives a radical anion (vinyl radical anion).\n2. Protonation by $NH_3$ gives a vinyl radical.\n3. A second single-electron transfer gives a vinyl anion.\n4. A second protonation by $NH_3$ furnishes the alkene.\n\nThe key stereochemical outcome arises because the protonation steps occur anti to the site of electron density in the radical anion and vinyl anion intermediates, leading to anti addition overall. For an internal alkyne $R-C\\equiv C-R'$, dissolving metal conditions give the trans-alkene $R-CH=CH-R'$ as the major product. This contrasts with catalytic hydrogenation over Lindlar catalyst, which gives the cis-alkene.\n\nApplying this to 5-methyl-2-hexyne:\n- The double bond remains between C2 and C3 after reduction, giving a 2-hexene skeleton.\n- Each alkene carbon (C2 and C3) bears one hydrogen and one carbon substituent. On C2, the higher-priority substituent (by CIP rules) is the C1 alkyl group ($CH_3$) rather than H. On C3, the higher-priority substituent is the C4 chain ($-CH_2CH(CH_3)_2$) rather than H.\n- Because the dissolving metal reduction produces anti (trans) addition of hydrogens, the two hydrogens end up on opposite sides of the double bond; therefore, the higher-priority substituents (the carbon chains on C2 and C3) are also on opposite sides. By CIP definition, this is the $E$ configuration.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for the major product is therefore $(E)$-5-methyl-2-hexene.\n\nAmong the provided options, this corresponds to choice A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2167723"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical knowledge is most powerful when it can be used to understand real-world laboratory outcomes. This problem shifts our focus to experimental troubleshooting, presenting a scenario where a dissolving metal reduction has failed to go to completion. To find the cause, you must think critically about the role of each reagent and the consequence of altering the procedural sequence, highlighting the delicate interplay between the powerful reducing agent (solvated electrons) and the proton source in this synthesis [@problem_id:2167682].", "problem": "A student in an undergraduate organic chemistry lab attempts to synthesize (E)-stilbene via a dissolving metal reduction of diphenylacetylene. The planned procedure is as follows:\n1.  Cool a flask to -78 °C and condense 50 mL of anhydrous ammonia (NH₃) into it.\n2.  Dissolve 5.0 g of diphenylacetylene in the liquid ammonia.\n3.  Slowly add small pieces of sodium (Na) metal until a persistent deep blue color is observed, and then add two molar equivalents in total.\n4.  Stir the blue solution for 30 minutes.\n5.  Add 10 mL of absolute ethanol (EtOH) dropwise to quench the reaction.\n6.  Allow the ammonia to evaporate and work up the reaction to isolate the product.\n\nAfter carrying out the synthesis and analyzing the crude product by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the student is surprised to find that the product mixture contains a significant amount of unreacted diphenylacetylene along with the desired (E)-stilbene. Which of the following procedural errors is the most likely cause for the incomplete reaction?\n\nA. The ethanol was accidentally added to the solution of diphenylacetylene in liquid ammonia *before* the addition of sodium metal.\n\nB. The reaction was run at -78 °C (dry ice/acetone bath) instead of at the boiling point of ammonia (-33 °C).\n\nC. An insufficient amount of liquid ammonia was used, causing the concentration of the alkyne to be too high.\n\nD. The quench was performed with absolute ethanol instead of with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride ($NH_{4}Cl$).\n\nE. The reaction was only stirred for 30 minutes, which was not enough time for the reduction to go to completion.", "solution": "The dissolving-metal reduction of an internal alkyne to a trans-alkene in liquid ammonia proceeds by two sequential single-electron transfers and two protonations. Symbolically, for an alkyne substrate:\n$$\\text{RC}\\equiv\\text{CR'} \\xrightarrow[\\text{ROH}]{\\text{Na/NH}_{3}} \\text{RCH}=\\text{CHR'} \\ (\\text{predominantly } E)$$\nwith the following idealized steps:\n1) First electron transfer: \n$$RC\\equiv CR' + e^{-} \\to [RC\\equiv CR']^{\\bullet -}$$\n2) First protonation:\n$$[RC\\equiv CR']^{\\bullet -} + ROH \\to R\\dot{C}=CR'H + RO^{-}$$\n3) Second electron transfer:\n$$R\\dot{C}=CR'H + e^{-} \\to RC^{-}=CR'H$$\n4) Second protonation:\n$$RC^{-}=CR'H + ROH \\to RCH=CHR' + RO^{-}$$\n\nThus, per mole of alkyne, the process requires $2$ equivalents of electrons (from $2$ equivalents of Na) and $2$ equivalents of a proton source (commonly an alcohol). Crucially, the electrons must exist as solvated electrons in liquid ammonia; any strong proton source present before electron generation will compete for and consume those electrons or the sodium metal.\n\nIf ethanol is present before adding sodium, two deleterious pathways occur:\n- Direct protonolysis of sodium metal:\n$$2 Na + 2 ROH \\to 2 RONa + H_{2}$$\n- Rapid consumption of solvated electrons by the alcohol:\n$$e^{-} + ROH \\to RO^{-} + H^{\\bullet}$$\n\nLet $n_{alkyne}$ be the moles of alkyne, $n_{Na}$ the moles of sodium added, and $n_{EtOH}$ the moles of ethanol present before sodium addition. The student added $n_{Na}=2 n_{alkyne}$ (two equivalents relative to the alkyne). If ethanol is added before sodium and $n_{EtOH}\\geq n_{Na}$, then sodium is consumed stoichiometrically by ethanol:\n$$\\Delta n_{Na,available}=n_{Na}-\\min(n_{Na},n_{EtOH})\\leq 0,$$\nleaving no sodium to generate solvated electrons and therefore preventing complete reduction of the alkyne. Even if $0 < n_{EtOH} < n_{Na}$, a significant fraction of sodium (and hence solvated electrons) will be consumed, leading to incomplete conversion and a mixture of unreacted alkyne and alkene—exactly what was observed.\n\nAssessing the alternatives:\n- B: Running at lower temperature (around the temperature of a dry ice bath) is standard for liquid ammonia reactions; electron transfer still proceeds efficiently. Temperature alone is not the primary cause of large amounts of starting alkyne remaining.\n- C: Using less ammonia (higher substrate concentration) does not inherently prevent the dissolving-metal reduction; it can affect mixing but is not the typical cause of substantial unreacted alkyne.\n- D: The choice of quench (absolute ethanol versus saturated aqueous $NH_{4}Cl$) impacts workup and final protonation conditions but does not retroactively cause incomplete reduction once the blue solution stage is complete.\n- E: Thirty minutes is generally ample for this fast electron-transfer process under dissolving-metal conditions; time is unlikely the limiting factor.\n\nTherefore, the most likely procedural error that would specifically leave a significant amount of unreacted diphenylacetylene is adding ethanol before sodium, which consumes sodium and solvated electrons and suppresses the reduction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2167682"}]}
