Excess sodium amide in liquid ammonia effects two successive E2 dehydrohalogenations of dihalides to form an alkyne. For a terminal alkyne adjacent to an aryl ring, the appropriate precursor is a two-carbon side chain bearing two halogens on adjacent carbons (vicinal) attached to the ring, so that two consecutive eliminations generate the carbon–carbon triple bond at the terminus next to the ring. In general, a vicinal dibromide of the form $Ph–CHBr–CH_2Br$ undergoes:\n$$Ph–CHBr–CH_2Br \\xrightarrow[\\text{excess}]{\\text{NaNH}_{2}, \\text{NH}_{3(l)}} Ph–C \\equiv CH$$\nwith two E2 eliminations to install the triple bond; under the strongly basic conditions, the terminal alkyne is transiently deprotonated to the acetylide and is obtained after protonation on workup.\nNow evaluate the options with the constraint “vicinal dibromide” and the requirement to form phenylacetylene:\n- A. (1,2-Dibromoethyl)benzene is a vicinal dibromide on the benzylic side chain ($Ph–CHBr–CH_2Br$) and undergoes two E2 eliminations to give phenylacetylene. This matches both the vicinal requirement and the target structure.\n- B. (1,1-Dibromoethyl)benzene is geminal, not vicinal; although geminal dihalides can also yield alkynes under these conditions, it does not satisfy the “vicinal” criterion.\n- C. (2,2-Dibromoethyl)benzene is also geminal, not vicinal.\n- D. 1,2-Dibromobenzene has halogens on the aromatic ring and under $NaNH_2$ generates benzyne intermediates, not phenylacetylene.\n- E. 1,2-Dibromopropane is a vicinal dibromide but lacks the phenyl group; it would give propyne, not phenylacetylene.\nTherefore, the appropriate vicinal dibromide precursor is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2191320"}, {"introduction": "A successful synthesis depends not only on choosing the right reagents but also on using them in the correct amounts.

No reaction occurs", "solution": "Identify the substrate and the reaction conditions. The substrate is 2,2-dibromopropane, which has the structure $CH_3-CBr_2-CH_3$ (a geminal dihalide on the central carbon). The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, a very strong base that promotes dehydrohalogenation via an E2 mechanism.\n\nState the relevant principle. For vicinal or geminal dihalides, strong base induces successive E2 eliminations of HBr. Each elimination consumes one equivalent of base. The first elimination from a geminal dihalide yields a vinyl halide; a second elimination (requiring another equivalent of strong base) converts the vinyl halide to an alkyne.\n\nApply the principle with exactly one equivalent of base. With one equivalent of NaNH2, only a single E2 dehydrohalogenation occurs: one bromide leaves from the central carbon and one beta hydrogen is abstracted from an adjacent methyl group, forming a double bond between the methyl carbon and the central carbon. The remaining bromine stays on the vinylic carbon. The transformation can be represented as:\n$$CH_3-CBr_2-CH_3 + NaNH_2 \\rightarrow CH_2=C(Br)-CH_3 + NaBr + NH_3$$\nBecause the molecule is symmetric, elimination from either side gives the same vinyl bromide: 2-bromopropene.\n\nExclude other options based on stoichiometry and mechanism. Formation of propyne would require a second elimination from the vinyl bromide and thus at least a second equivalent of strong base; therefore, with exactly one equivalent present, the reaction stops at the vinyl bromide. Propadiene does not arise from this substrate under these conditions. Nucleophilic substitution to give 2-amino-2-bromopropane is disfavored (no SN2 at a hindered vinylic or tertiary center; SN1 is not supported in these basic conditions), and “no reaction” is inconsistent with the known strong-base-promoted elimination.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromopropene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2191313"}, {"introduction": "Real-world organic synthesis often involves molecules with multiple functional groups, requiring a careful analysis of reactivity.

This consumes one equivalent of base:\n$$\\text{ROH} + NaNH_2 \\rightarrow \\text{RONa} + NH_3$$\nTherefore, from $n$ total equivalents of $NaNH_2$, only $n-1$ equivalents remain available for elimination.\n\nKey principle 2: Dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide to an alkyne proceeds by two successive eliminations of $HBr$. The first elimination gives a vinyl bromide (bromoalkene) via $E2$; the second elimination of $HBr$ from the vinyl bromide to the alkyne also requires a strong base such as $NaNH_2$. Thus, two base equivalents are required for the two $E2$ steps beyond any equivalents consumed by acid-base reaction with an alcohol.\n\nKey principle 3: Stereochemical outcome of $E2$ from a vicinal dihalide depends on the relative configuration. A threo-1,2-dihalide (one center $R$, the other $S$) undergoes anti-elimination to give the $E$-alkene, whereas an erythro-1,2-dihalide gives the $Z$-alkene. Here, the starting material is $(4S,5R)$, i.e., threo.\n\nApply these to each scenario:\n\nScenario A (2.0 equivalents of $NaNH_2$): One equivalent is consumed to form the alkoxide at C1. Only one equivalent remains for elimination, so only a single dehydrohalogenation occurs, producing a vinyl bromide. Because the substrate is threo $(4S,5R)$, anti $E2$ gives the $E$-alkenyl bromide. With the numbering fixed by the alcohol at C1, this product is $(E)$-5-bromohex-4-en-1-ol.\n\nScenario B (3.0 equivalents of $NaNH_2$): One equivalent again deprotonates the alcohol. Two equivalents remain available, which are sufficient for the two eliminations of $HBr$ to form the alkyne between C4 and C5. After aqueous workup, the alkoxide is reprotonated to regenerate the alcohol, giving hex-4-yn-1-ol as the neutral product.\n\nTherefore, the major products are:\n- Scenario A: $(E)$-5-bromohex-4-en-1-ol.\n- Scenario B: hex-4-yn-1-ol.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2191325"}]}
