In oxymercuration with mercury(II) acetate in water, the alkene reacts to form a bridged mercurinium ion. Nucleophilic attack by water occurs at the more substituted carbon due to better stabilization of positive charge in the transition state, giving Markovnikov regiochemistry. Therefore, after nucleophilic opening and deprotonation, the intermediate has an alcohol function at C1 (the more substituted carbon bearing the methyl group) and a C–Hg(OAc) group at C2 (the less substituted carbon). Oxymercuration proceeds without carbocation rearrangement.\n\nIn the subsequent demercuration step using sodium borodeuteride, the borodeuteride reagent reduces the carbon–mercury bond by delivering deuteride to the carbon bearing mercury, replacing Hg(OAc) with deuterium while leaving the hydroxyl group in place. Thus deuterium is installed at C2, and the hydroxyl remains at C1. The methyl substituent remains at C1 throughout.\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature for cyclohexanols, the ring is numbered so that the carbon bearing the hydroxyl is C1. In the product, both the hydroxyl and the methyl are on C1, and deuterium is on C2.
