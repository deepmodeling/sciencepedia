This is typically accomplished through a two-step sequence involving the formation of an epoxide intermediate, which is then opened via nucleophilic attack.\n\nConsider the synthesis of pentane-1,2-diol starting from 1-pentene.

This is not the epoxide pathway and not anti, so it is incorrect.\n\nB. $O_3$ followed by Zn, $H_2O$ is reductive ozonolysis that cleaves the double bond to carbonyl compounds; it does not yield a diol. Incorrect.\n\nC. $BH_3 \\cdot THF$ followed by $H_2O_2$, $NaOH$ is hydroboration–oxidation, giving a single alcohol (anti-Markovnikov hydration), not a vicinal diol. Incorrect.\n\nD. m-CPBA epoxidizes the alkene to the corresponding epoxide. Subsequent treatment with $H_3O^+$ protonates the epoxide and water attacks in an anti fashion (backside attack on the protonated epoxide), yielding the trans (anti) 1,2-diol. This exactly follows the described two-step epoxide formation then nucleophilic opening and gives pentane-1,2-diol. Correct.\n\nE. $Br_2, H_2O$ forms a halohydrin (anti addition of Br and OH). $NaOH$ (aq) then deprotonates the alcohol to form the epoxide via intramolecular displacement. Although hydroxide in water can, in principle, open epoxides to give trans diols, the sequence as written specifies epoxide formation in step 2, not a distinct subsequent opening step; it therefore does not match the described two-step “epoxide then opening” sequence as given. The canonical outcome emphasized for this two-step set is epoxide formation rather than the diol under the listed conditions.

Starting with a symmetrical cis-alkene, you will trace the stereochemistry through the formation of an achiral meso-epoxide and its subsequent ring-opening. This problem is crucial for understanding how the strict anti-addition of the two hydroxyl groups dictates the final three-dimensional structure of the products, leading to a racemic mixture [@problem_id:2155051].", "problem": "A two-step synthesis is performed starting from cis-3-hexene. In the first step, cis-3-hexene is reacted with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) to form an intermediate, which we will call Compound A. In the second step, Compound A is isolated and then hydrolyzed using dilute aqueous sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$).

A racemic mixture of a pair of enantiomers is formed.\n\nC. A single, optically active chiral compound is formed.\n\nD. A pair of diastereomers is formed in unequal amounts.\n\nE. No reaction occurs in the second step.", "solution": "Step 1 (epoxidation): cis-3-hexene is an internal alkene with identical substituents (ethyl groups) on each alkene carbon and one hydrogen on each alkene carbon. Reaction with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid proceeds by a concerted, stereospecific syn epoxidation. A cis-disubstituted alkene gives a cis-epoxide, preserving the relative stereochemistry of substituents. Because the alkene is symmetrically disubstituted (ethyl on both alkene carbons), the resulting epoxide (3,4-epoxyhexane) possesses an internal mirror plane and is meso (achiral). This epoxide is Compound A.\n\nStep 2 (acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the epoxide): In dilute aqueous sulfuric acid, the epoxide is first protonated at oxygen to form an oxonium ion. Nucleophilic attack by water then occurs with backside attack at an epoxide carbon, opening the ring with inversion at the attacked carbon. Under acidic conditions, in an unsymmetrical epoxide attack is favored at the more substituted carbon; here, both epoxide carbons are equivalent, so attack occurs at either carbon with equal probability. The opening is anti relative to the departing $C-O$ bond, giving overall anti addition of two hydroxyl groups across the original double bond. Therefore, the product is the trans-1,2-diol, specifically trans-3,4-hexanediol.\n\nStereochemical outcome: Anti dihydroxylation of a cis-disubstituted, symmetrical alkene produces a pair of enantiomers in equal amounts (a racemic mixture). Although the epoxide intermediate is meso, its acid-catalyzed, anti opening can occur from either face to give enantiomeric trans diols with no internal plane of symmetry. Thus, the final product mixture is racemic.\n\nTherefore, a racemic mixture of a pair of enantiomers is formed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2155051"}, {"introduction": "The true power of understanding a reaction lies in the ability to use it for targeted synthesis. This final practice flips the script from prediction to design, asking you to work backward from a desired product. To synthesize a specific stereoisomer, (2S,3S)-pentane-2,3-diol, you must apply your knowledge of how an alkene's initial geometry ($E$ versus $Z$) translates through the anti-dihydroxylation sequence to the final diol's relative stereochemistry.

It preserves the relative geometry of substituents: a $Z$-alkene gives a cis-disubstituted epoxide, and an $E$-alkene gives a trans-disubstituted epoxide.\n- Acid-catalyzed epoxide opening by $H_{2}O$ proceeds via protonation of the epoxide followed by nucleophilic attack at the more substituted carbon with backside attack (inversion at the attacked carbon). Overall, opening of the epoxide gives anti addition of two $-OH$ groups across the original $C=C$.\n\nNet stereochemical outcome:\n- Epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis corresponds to anti dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n- For anti dihydroxylation, the relative stereochemistry correlates with alkene geometry as follows: anti addition to a $Z$-alkene gives the threo diol (enantiomeric pair $(2R,3R)$ and $(2S,3S)$), while anti addition to an $E$-alkene gives the erythro diol (enantiomeric pair $(2R,3S)$ and $(2S,3R)$). This correlation is established by considering the planar alkene with cis or trans higher-priority substituents, placing the two $-OH$ groups anti across the double bond, and assigning Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priorities to determine that a $Z$-alkene leads to both centers having the same absolute configuration (either both $R$ or both $S$), whereas an $E$-alkene leads to opposite configurations at $C2$ and $C3$.\n\nApplication to the options:\n- A (pent-1-ene) and E (3-methylbut-1-ene) place the double bond at $C1-C2$, leading to a 1,2-diol, not the desired 2,3-diol.\n- D (2-methylbut-2-ene) has the wrong carbon skeleton and would not give pentane-2,3-diol.\n- B is $(E)$-pent-2-ene, which under anti dihydroxylation gives the erythro diol, i.e., $(2R,3S)/(2S,3R)$, not the desired $(2S,3S)$ diastereomer.\n- C is $(Z)$-pent-2-ene, which under anti dihydroxylation gives the threo diol, i.e., the enantiomeric pair $(2R,3R)$ and $(2S,3S)$, matching the required diastereomer.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting alkene is $(Z)$-pent-2-ene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2155046"}]}
