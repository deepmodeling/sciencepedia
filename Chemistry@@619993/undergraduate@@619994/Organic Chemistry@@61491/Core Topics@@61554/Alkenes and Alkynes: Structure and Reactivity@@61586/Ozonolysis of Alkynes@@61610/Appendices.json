By analyzing the fragments produced after cleaving a carbon-carbon multiple bond, we can deduce the structure of the original molecule. This first exercise [@problem_id:2188481] challenges you to apply the principles of oxidative ozonolysis, where an alkyne is cleaved to form carboxylic acids, to work backward from a known product to identify an unknown symmetrical alkyne.", "problem": "An unknown symmetrical alkyne has the molecular formula $C_8H_{14}$. When this compound is subjected to a two-step reaction sequence, first with ozone ($O_3$) and then with water ($H_2O$), the only organic product isolated is butanoic acid. Determine the name of the original alkyne according to the nomenclature rules set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).", "solution": "We are told the unknown alkyne is symmetrical and has formula $C_8H_{14}$. For an acyclic alkyne, the general formula is $C_nH_{2n-2}$, which for $n=8$ gives $H=2 \\cdot 8 - 2 = 14$, consistent with an acyclic $C_8$ alkyne.\n\nOzonolysis of an internal alkyne followed by oxidative workup (here $O_3$ then $H_2O$) effects oxidative cleavage of the $C \\equiv C$ bond, converting each alkyne carbon into the carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid. Thus, for a symmetrical internal alkyne of the form $R-C \\equiv C-R$, the products are two equivalents of the same carboxylic acid, namely $R-COOH$. In contrast, a terminal alkyne would give $CO_2$ plus a carboxylic acid, which is ruled out because the only organic product observed is butanoic acid. Therefore, the alkyne must be an internal symmetrical alkyne.\n\nLet $m$ be the number of carbon atoms in $R$. The carboxylic acid formed has\n$$\n\\text{carbons in acid} = 1 + m\n$$\nbecause the alkyne carbon becomes the carboxyl carbon (counted as $1$) and $R$ contributes $m$ carbons as the alkyl substituent on the carbonyl. The observed acid is butanoic acid, which has $4$ carbons, so\n$$\n1 + m = 4 \\Rightarrow m = 3.\n$$\nHence $R$ must be a propyl group. To obtain unbranched butanoic acid (and not a branched isomer such as 2-methylpropanoic acid), $R$ must be the $n$-propyl group. Therefore the alkyne is\n$$\nCH_3CH_2CH_2-C \\equiv C-CH_2CH_2CH_3,\n$$\nwhich is an $8$-carbon chain with the triple bond in the middle. Numbering the longest chain of eight carbons to give the lowest possible locant for the triple bond places it at carbon $4$, giving the IUPAC name oct-4-yne.\n\nThis structure also accounts for the molecular formula $C_8H_{14}$ and for ozonolysis yielding only butanoic acid (two equivalents).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{oct-4-yne}}$$", "id": "2188481"}, {"introduction": "The products of an ozonolysis reaction are critically determined by the workup procedure that follows the initial reaction with ozone.
