The goal is to perform a reaction using exactly one equivalent of sodium amide ($NaNH_2$), a very strong base, in an inert solvent. An acid-base reaction is expected to occur, where the base removes the most acidic proton from the 4-hydroxy-1-butyne molecule.\n\nTo aid in your analysis, you are provided with the following representative pKa values:\n- The pKa for the acidic proton of a typical primary alcohol ($R-CH_2-OH$) is approximately 17.\n- The pKa for the acidic proton of a typical terminal alkyne ($R-C \\equiv C-H$) is approximately 25.\n- The pKa for a proton on a saturated $sp^3$ carbon atom ($R_3C-H$) is approximately 50.\n\nBased on this information, which proton in the 4-hydroxy-1-butyne molecule is most likely to be removed in this reaction?

Equivalently, for two competing acidic sites $HA_{1}$ and $HA_{2}$, the base removes the proton from the site with the lower $pK_{a}$ (the more acidic site).\n\nIn 4-hydroxy-1-butyne, labeled $HO-C_{4}H_{2}-C_{3}H_{2}-C_{2}\\equiv C_{1}-H$, the potentially acidic protons are:\n- D: the $O\\!-\\!H$ proton of the alcohol,\n- A: the terminal alkyne proton at carbon-1 ($C_{1}-H$),\n- B and C: saturated $sp^{3}$ $C\\!-\\!H$ protons at carbons 3 and 4.\n\nThe provided representative $pK_{a}$ values are:\n- $pK_{a}(R-CH_{2}-OH) \\approx 17$ for the alcohol $O\\!-\\!H$,\n- $pK_{a}(R-C\\equiv C-H) \\approx 25$ for a terminal alkyne $C\\!-\\!H$,\n- $pK_{a}(R_{3}C-H) \\approx 50$ for saturated $sp^{3}$ $C\\!-\\!H$.\n\nThus, the acidity order is\n$$O\\!-\\!H\\ \\text{(}pK_{a}\\approx 17\\text{)}\\;>\\;C\\equiv C\\!-\\!H\\ \\text{(}pK_{a}\\approx 25\\text{)}\\;>\\;sp^{3}\\ C\\!-\\!H\\ \\text{(}pK_{a}\\approx 50\\text{)}.$$\n\nWith exactly one equivalent of $NaNH_{2}$ (base $NH_{2}^{-}$) in an inert solvent, the dominant acid–base event will be deprotonation at the most acidic site. Comparing the two plausible acidic sites, alcohol $O\\!-\\!H$ versus terminal alkyne $C\\!-\\!H$, the alcohol has the lower $pK_{a}$, so $NH_{2}^{-}$ removes the alcohol proton:\n$$HO\\!-\\!CH_{2}CH_{2}C\\equiv CH + NH_{2}^{-} \\longrightarrow ^{-}O\\!-\\!CH_{2}CH_{2}C\\equiv CH + NH_{3}.$$\nDeprotonation at carbon-1,\n$$HO\\!-\\!CH_{2}CH_{2}C\\equiv CH + NH_{2}^{-} \\longrightarrow HO\\!-\\!CH_{2}CH_{2}C\\equiv C^{-} + NH_{3},$$\nis less favored relative to the $O\\!-\\!H$ deprotonation because $pK_{a}(RC\\equiv CH)$ is higher than $pK_{a}(ROH)$. Deprotonation at carbons 3 or 4 would require removing an $sp^{3}$ $C\\!-\\!H$ proton with $pK_{a}\\approx 50$, which is far less acidic and therefore not competitive under these conditions. With only one equivalent of base, it will be consumed at the most acidic site, yielding the alkoxide.\n\nTherefore, the proton most likely to be removed is the one attached to the oxygen atom.\n\nThe correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2153215"}, {"introduction": "Once formed, acetylide anions are powerful carbon nucleophiles used to construct larger molecular frameworks.
