To master organic synthesis, it's as important to work backward from a target product as it is to predict the outcome of a reaction. This problem [@problem_id:2169806] challenges you to identify the correct alkene starting material to form a specific epoxide, reinforcing your understanding of how the core carbon skeleton is preserved during epoxidation.", "problem": "In organic synthesis, the epoxidation of an alkene using a peroxyacid, such as meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), is a fundamental transformation. This reaction is known for its stereospecificity, where an oxygen atom is delivered to one face of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nA chemist wishes to synthesize a specific bicyclic ether, cis-1,2-epoxy-4,4-dimethylcyclohexane. To achieve this, she must choose the correct alkene starting material to react with m-CPBA. Given the list of possible starting materials below, identify the correct alkene that will yield the desired product.\n\nA. 3,3-Dimethylcyclohexene\n\nB. 4,4-Dimethylcyclohexene\n\nC. 1,2-Dimethylcyclohexene\n\nD. 1,5-Dimethylcyclohexene", "solution": "The relevant principle is that epoxidation of an alkene by a peroxyacid such as m-CPBA proceeds by a concerted, stereospecific, syn addition to the carbon-carbon double bond. Consequently, the relative stereochemistry of substituents on the alkene carbons is preserved, and substituents not on the alkene carbons remain in their original positions; only the double bond is converted into an epoxide.\n\nThe target product is cis-1,2-epoxy-4,4-dimethylcyclohexane. This indicates:\n- The epoxide spans carbons 1 and 2 of the cyclohexane ring (a 1,2-epoxide).\n- There is a geminal dimethyl group at carbon 4 that remains unchanged during epoxidation.\n- Epoxidation of cyclohexene inherently gives the cis-fused epoxide due to syn oxygen delivery.\n\nTherefore, the correct alkene must be a cyclohexene with the double bond at carbons 1 and 2 and gem-dimethyl substitution at carbon 4. By nomenclature, “cyclohexene” without position numbers denotes the 1,2-double bond; hence “4,4-dimethylcyclohexene” is the substrate that, upon epoxidation, yields cis-1,2-epoxy-4,4-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\nChecking the options:\n- A (3,3-dimethylcyclohexene) would give a 3,3-dimethyl epoxide, not the desired 4,4-dimethyl product.\n- B (4,4-dimethylcyclohexene) has the correct geminal dimethyl at C4 and the standard 1,2-alkene, giving the desired product upon epoxidation.\n- C (1,2-dimethylcyclohexene) places methyl groups on the alkene carbons, not at C4, yielding a different substitution pattern.\n- D (1,5-dimethylcyclohexene) places methyl groups at C1 and C5, not geminal at C4.\n\nThus, the correct choice is 4,4-dimethylcyclohexene.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2169806"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've established the basic transformation, let's explore its crucial three-dimensional nature. The epoxidation of alkenes with peroxyacids is a stereospecific reaction, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting material dictates the stereochemistry of the product. This exercise [@problem_id:2169785] uses the classic example of stilbene isomers to demonstrate how an $(E)$-alkene and a $(Z)$-alkene lead to distinctly different stereochemical outcomes—either a racemic mixture or an achiral meso compound.", "problem": "The epoxidation of an alkene using a peroxyacid, such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA), is a common method for synthesizing epoxides. The reaction is known to be stereospecific, meaning that the stereochemistry of the starting alkene dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide. Consider the two geometric isomers of stilbene (1,2-diphenylethene): (E)-stilbene and (Z)-stilbene. When one of these isomers is treated with a peroxyacid, the reaction can potentially yield a single chiral product, a pair of enantiomers (as a racemic mixture), or an achiral meso compound.\n\nWhich of the following starting materials will produce a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides upon reaction with m-CPBA?\n\nA. (E)-stilbene\n\nB. (Z)-stilbene\n\nC. A 1:1 mixture of (E)- and (Z)-stilbene\n\nD. Neither isomer, as this reaction always produces an achiral meso compound.", "solution": "The key principles are:\n- Peroxyacid epoxidation proceeds by a concerted, stereospecific mechanism (the oxygen is delivered to the alkene in a single step), so the relative configuration of substituents on the alkene is preserved in the epoxide.\n- For a 1,2-disubstituted alkene with identical substituents on each carbon (here each alkene carbon bears phenyl and hydrogen), the resulting epoxide has two stereocenters. Whether the product is meso or a pair of enantiomers depends on the relative (cis or trans) arrangement of the substituents in the epoxide.\n\nStep 1: Map alkene geometry to epoxide stereochemistry.\n- An $(E)$-alkene gives a trans-epoxide (the two phenyl groups end up on opposite faces of the epoxide ring).\n- A $(Z)$-alkene gives a cis-epoxide (the two phenyl groups end up on the same face of the epoxide ring).\n\nStep 2: Determine chirality and symmetry of the epoxides.\n- For cis-1,2-disubstituted epoxides with identical substituents at C1 and C2 (phenyl/hydrogen on each), there is an internal mirror plane, so the product is a single achiral meso compound.\n- For trans-1,2-disubstituted epoxides with identical substituents at C1 and C2, there is no internal mirror plane; the two stereocenters give a pair of enantiomers. With an achiral reagent (m-CPBA), these are formed in equal amounts, i.e., as a racemic mixture.\n\nStep 3: Apply to the options.\n- A. $(E)$-stilbene gives the trans-epoxide, which is formed as a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n- B. $(Z)$-stilbene gives the cis-epoxide, which is meso (not racemic).\n- C. A 1:1 mixture of $(E)$- and $(Z)$-stilbene would yield a mixture of a racemic pair (from $(E)$) and a meso compound (from $(Z)$), not solely a racemic mixture.\n- D. Incorrect because $(E)$-stilbene does not produce a meso epoxide.\n\nTherefore, only $(E)$-stilbene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomeric epoxides with m-CPBA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2169785"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of structure and stereochemistry, we now turn to the question of selectivity. What happens when a molecule contains more than one double bond? This practice [@problem_id:2169783] introduces the concept of chemoselectivity, which is governed by the electronic nature of the reaction. You will predict which of two different alkene groups will react preferentially with a limited amount of peroxyacid, a key skill for designing complex syntheses.", "problem": "An organic chemistry student investigates the selective epoxidation of a non-conjugated diene. The student treats 1-methylcyclohexa-1,4-diene with exactly one molar equivalent of meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) in dichloromethane, a non-polar, aprotic solvent. Assuming the reaction proceeds to completion, which of the following statements best describes the major organic product formed?\n\nA. The major product is the epoxide formed at the double bond between C-1 and C-2.\n\nB. The major product is the epoxide formed at the double bond between C-4 and C-5.\n\nC. Both possible mono-epoxides are formed in approximately equal amounts, resulting in a nearly 1:1 mixture.\n\nD. A diepoxide is the major product, resulting from the reaction of both double bonds with m-CPBA.\n\nE. A rearranged allylic alcohol, 4-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol, is the major product.", "solution": "Identify the reactive sites: 1-methylcyclohexa-1,4-diene contains two isolated double bonds, at C-1–C-2 and C-4–C-5. The C-1–C-2 alkene is more substituted because C-1 bears a methyl group; this alkene is effectively trisubstituted, whereas the C-4–C-5 alkene is disubstituted.\n\nRecall the governing principle for Prilezhaev epoxidation with peracids (such as m-CPBA): the reaction proceeds via a concerted electrophilic addition, and the rate increases with alkene electron density and degree of substitution. Thus, more substituted, more electron-rich alkenes are epoxidized faster than less substituted ones. Steric effects are generally secondary to this electronic preference under typical conditions.\n\nApply selectivity: therefore, the C-1–C-2 double bond reacts preferentially with m-CPBA to give the corresponding epoxide.\n\nAccount for stoichiometry: exactly one molar equivalent of m-CPBA is used. With two potential alkenes in each substrate molecule, a diepoxide cannot be the major product under oxidant-limited conditions; the more reactive double bond will consume the available oxidant first, furnishing predominantly the mono-epoxide at C-1–C-2.\n\nExclude rearrangements and side products: the solvent, dichloromethane, is non-polar and aprotic, which does not promote epoxide opening or rearrangements. Under these conditions, formation of an allylic alcohol is not expected.\n\nConclusion: the major product is the epoxide formed at the C-1–C-2 double bond, not a mixture, not the C-4–C-5 epoxide, not a diepoxide, and not a rearranged alcohol. Hence, option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2169783"}]}
