In the oxidation step with $\\mathrm{H_{2}O_{2},\\,NaOH}$, the C–B bond is converted to a C–O bond with retention of configuration at carbon, so the overall addition of H and OH is *syn*.\n\nApply this to 1-methylcyclopentene, which has the double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl substituent on C1:\n- Hydroboration places B at C2 (less substituted) and H at C1 (more substituted), in a *syn* fashion from one face of the alkene.\n- Oxidation converts C2–B to C2–OH with retention of configuration. Therefore, H at C1 and OH at C2 are installed on the same face of the ring (*syn* addition across the former double bond).\n\nThe product has new stereocenters at C1 and C2:\n- At C1, after addition, the substituents are $\\mathrm{H}$ (new), $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$, and two different ring paths, making C1 stereogenic.\n- At C2, after addition, the substituents are $\\mathrm{OH}$ (new), $\\mathrm{H}$, and two different ring paths, making C2 stereogenic.\n\nBecause the *syn* addition can occur from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability and there is no internal plane of symmetry (the substituents at C1 and C2 are different, e.g., $\\mathrm{CH_{3}}$ versus $\\mathrm{OH}$), the two products formed are non-superimposable mirror images. No other diastereomeric products are formed because the mechanism enforces *syn* addition and fixed regiochemistry.

(Z)-Hex-2-ene", "solution": "The problem asks to identify an alkene with the formula $C_6H_{12}$ that yields a single, achiral alcohol upon hydroboration-oxidation. Let's analyze the key features of this reaction and the required properties of the product. The hydroboration-oxidation reaction proceeds in two steps. The first step, hydroboration, involves the addition of a borane (like $\\mathrm{BH_3}$) across the double bond. This addition is regioselective, following an anti-Markovnikov pattern, where the boron atom adds to the less sterically hindered (less substituted) carbon of the double bond. The addition is also stereospecific, occurring via a *syn*-addition, where the boron and the hydrogen atom add to the same face of the alkene. The second step, oxidation, replaces the boron atom with a hydroxyl ($-OH$) group with retention of stereochemistry. The net result is the *syn*-addition of $H$ and $OH$ across the double bond, with the $OH$ group on the less substituted carbon.\n\nThe product must be a \"single, achiral alcohol\".\n- \"Single\" implies that the reaction produces predominantly one constitutional isomer and that this product is not a mixture of stereoisomers (like a racemic mixture).\n- \"Achiral\" means the product molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. This is typically true for molecules that lack a stereocenter or for meso compounds which possess an internal plane of symmetry despite having stereocenters.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. (E)-Hex-3-ene: The structure is $\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH=CHCH_2CH_3}$. This is a symmetrically substituted internal alkene. Hydroboration can occur at either C-3 or C-4, but due to the molecule's symmetry, both additions lead to the same constitutional isomer: hexan-3-ol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH(OH)CH_2CH_2CH_3}$). So, a single constitutional isomer is formed. However, C-3 in hexan-3-ol is a stereocenter (it is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, ethyl, and propyl). Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce a racemic mixture of (R)-hexan-3-ol and (S)-hexan-3-ol. This is a mixture of two enantiomers, not a single product. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\nB. 2-Methylpent-2-ene: The structure is $\\mathrm{CH_3C(CH_3)=CHCH_2CH_3}$. This is an unsymmetrical, trisubstituted alkene. According to the anti-Markovnikov rule, the boron atom will add to the less substituted carbon of the double bond, which is C-3. Oxidation then yields 2-methylpentan-3-ol ($\\mathrm{CH_3CH(CH_3)CH(OH)CH_2CH_3}$). The product molecule has two stereocenters: C-2 and C-3. The *syn*-addition mechanism leads to the formation of a specific pair of enantiomers (one diastereomer). The result is a racemic mixture. This is not a single, achiral product. Thus, B is incorrect.\n\nC. 2,3-Dimethylbut-2-ene: The structure is $\\mathrm{(CH_3)_2C=C(CH_3)_2}$. This is a symmetrically substituted, tetrasubstituted alkene. Due to its symmetry, the addition of the hydroxyl group to either of the double-bonded carbons (C-2 or C-3) results in the same product: 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which has the structure $\\mathrm{(CH_3)_2C(OH)CH(CH_3)_2}$. Let's examine the product for chirality. The carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C-2) is bonded to an OH group, an isopropyl group ($\\mathrm{CH(CH_3)_2}$), and two methyl groups. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a stereocenter. No other carbon in the molecule is a stereocenter. Therefore, the product is achiral. The reaction produces one product, 2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which is achiral. This matches the conditions specified in the problem. Thus, C is the correct answer.\n\nD. 1-Methylcyclopentene: This is a cyclic, trisubstituted alkene. The double bond is between C-1 (which has a methyl group) and C-2. Boron will add to the less substituted carbon, C-2. Subsequent oxidation gives 2-methylcyclopentanol. In the product, both C-1 (bearing the methyl group) and C-2 (bearing the hydroxyl group) are stereocenters. The *syn*-addition of H and OH results in the formation of *cis*-2-methylcyclopentanol. Since the starting alkene is achiral, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of *cis*-2-methylcyclopentanol is formed. This is a mixture of chiral molecules, not a single achiral product. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\nE. (Z)-Hex-2-ene: The structure is $\\mathrm{CH_3CH=CHCH_2CH_2CH_3}$. The double bond is between two non-equivalent secondary carbons. Hydroboration of such an alkene is not highly regioselective and will produce a mixture of two constitutional isomers: hexan-2-ol and hexan-3-ol. Both of these alcohols are chiral, so the final product is a complex mixture of at least four different stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers). This clearly does not meet the condition of a single product. Thus, E is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2201926"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice [@problem_id:2201912] moves into a more advanced realm of stereocontrol: diastereoselectivity. While an unhindered alkene may react from either face with equal probability, the presence of existing substituents can create a steric bias, favoring reaction on one face over the other. This exercise will challenge you to leverage this steric effect to devise a synthesis for a specific diastereomer, demonstrating how chemists can control stereochemistry to build complex molecules with precision.", "problem": "An organic chemist is planning a synthesis of a specific stereoisomer of 2-methylcyclohexanol. The chosen synthetic method is a two-step hydroboration-oxidation reaction sequence, starting from an alkene.

Mechanistically, boron adds to the less substituted carbon and is then replaced by OH with retention of configuration.\n(2) Stereochemistry: *syn* addition of H and B across the double bond; after oxidation, the net result is *syn* addition of H and OH across the alkene.\n\nTo obtain *trans*-2-methylcyclohexanol, the product must be cyclohexanol with OH at C1 (by nomenclature) and a methyl at C2, and the OH and methyl must be on opposite faces. This is achieved if:\n(i) the double bond is between the carbons that become C1 and C2 in the product,\n(ii) the OH ends up on the less substituted alkene carbon,\n(iii) the addition occurs from the face opposite the methyl substituent (steric control), so that the *syn*-added H and OH are on the face opposite the methyl, giving a trans 1,2 relationship between OH and Me in the product.\n\nAnalyze each option:\n- 1-methylcyclohexene has the double bond between the methyl-bearing carbon (call it C1) and its neighbor (C2). In hydroboration, B adds to the less substituted carbon (C2), H to the more substituted carbon (C1), *syn*. Oxidation gives OH at C2. Renumbering the product as cyclohexanol places OH at C1 and the methyl at C2, i.e., 2-methylcyclohexanol. Because the bulky hydroboration approaches preferentially from the face opposite the methyl, the added H at C1 and OH at C2 are both delivered to the face opposite the methyl. Consequently, in the product, OH and Me are on opposite faces (trans), making *trans*-2-methylcyclohexanol the major product.\n- 3-methylcyclohexene and 4-methylcyclohexene would yield 3- and 4-methylcyclohexanol after hydroboration-oxidation, not 2-methylcyclohexanol, because the OH installs adjacent to the original double bond and the methyl is not adjacent to that bond.\n- Methylenecyclohexane has an exocyclic double bond; hydroboration-oxidation places OH at the exocyclic (less substituted) carbon, giving cyclohexylmethanol rather than a 2-substituted cyclohexanol.\n- (E)-hept-2-ene is acyclic and cannot give a cyclohexanol product.\n\nTherefore, only 1-methylcyclohexene both yields the 2-methylcyclohexanol skeleton and, by steric approach from the less hindered face with *syn* addition, gives *trans*-2-methylcyclohexanol as the major product.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2201912"}]}
