This is the Lindlar catalyst. The key principle is selective, syn-addition partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a cis (Z) alkene, stopping at the alkene and not reducing further. Under these conditions, isolated alkenes are not appreciably hydrogenated, and dienes or cycloalkenes would not selectively give a single (Z)-3-hexene.\n\nThe product is specifically given as $(Z)$-3-hexene, which is the cis-alkene with the double bond between C3 and C4. By syn addition on an alkyne, the only way to place the double bond at C3–C4 and obtain the Z stereochemistry is to start from the corresponding internal alkyne at that position, namely 3-hexyne.\n\nCheck each option against Lindlar hydrogenation:\n- A. 1-Hexyne would give 1-hexene (no E/Z), not $(Z)$-3-hexene.\n- B. 2-Hexyne would give $(Z)$-2-hexene, wrong position.\n- C. 3-Hexyne would give $(Z)$-3-hexene by syn addition, correct position and stereochemistry.\n- D. 1,5-Hexadiene is an alkadiene; Lindlar catalyst does not selectively convert it to $(Z)$-3-hexene, and no single stereodefined product at C3–C4 would result.\n- E. Cyclohexene under Lindlar conditions is not reduced to an acyclic $(Z)$-3-hexene; at most, stronger catalysts could hydrogenate it to cyclohexane.\n\nTherefore, only 3-hexyne is consistent with the observed product $(Z)$-3-hexene under Lindlar hydrogenation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2188616"}, {"introduction": "A synthesis is only successful if the identity of the product can be confirmed.

The reaction is carried out using hydrogen gas ($H_2$) in the presence of Lindlar's catalyst.

The IR diagnostic changes must reflect consumption of the alkyne functional group and formation of a cis-disubstituted alkene.\n\nFirst, identify diagnostic IR features of the starting material:\n- Internal alkyne C≡C stretching gives a weak absorption in the region from $2100$ to $2260\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Although internal alkynes often show weak or even absent intensity due to symmetry, the expected change upon hydrogenation is the loss of any C≡C absorption present. Therefore, the disappearance of a weak absorption in this region is consistent with consumption of 3-hexyne, supporting option A.\n- A sharp, strong absorption around $3300\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to the $\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ stretch of a terminal alkyne. Because 3-hexyne is an internal alkyne, it does not possess a terminal $\\equiv\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ bond and thus does not show this band to begin with. Its “disappearance” is not a valid indicator here, so option C is not correct for this system.\n\nSecond, identify diagnostic IR features of the product:\n- An internal alkene introduces $=\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ stretching absorptions of medium intensity in the region from $3000$ to $3100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. 3-hexene has vinylic hydrogens, so the appearance of new absorptions in this region is expected.

A cis-disubstituted alkene shows a strong band in the region from $675$ to $730\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, whereas a trans-disubstituted alkene shows a strong band near $960$ to $970\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.

This advanced problem presents a scenario where the expected reaction does not go to completion, forcing a deeper look at the reaction mechanism. By rationalizing this unexpected selectivity, you will gain a more sophisticated appreciation for how steric effects can control reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis by governing access to the catalyst's surface. [@problem_id:2188623]", "problem": "The partial hydrogenation of alkynes to cis-alkenes using Lindlar's catalyst (palladium on calcium carbonate, poisoned with quinoline or lead acetate) is a cornerstone of stereoselective synthesis. Normally, in a molecule containing multiple alkynes, one would expect sequential hydrogenation to occur until all alkynes are reduced to alkenes, provided an excess of hydrogen gas is not used.\n\nConsider the molecule 1,4-di-tert-butylbuta-1,3-diyne. When this compound is subjected to hydrogenation ($H_2$) in the presence of Lindlar's catalyst, the reaction stops cleanly after the addition of one equivalent of $H_2$, selectively yielding (Z)-1,4-di-tert-butyl-1-buten-3-yne as the major product. The expected di-hydrogenation product, (Z,Z)-1,4-di-tert-butylbuta-1,3-diene, is not significantly formed.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate chemical rationale for this observed regioselectivity and arrested reactivity?\n\nA. The formation of the enyne intermediate creates a conjugated system that electronically deactivates the remaining alkyne, making it less susceptible to catalytic hydrogenation than the alkynes in the starting material.\nB. The (Z)-1,4-di-tert-butyl-1-buten-3-yne product is a more effective catalyst poison than the quinoline added to the Lindlar's catalyst, causing complete deactivation of the palladium surface upon its formation.\nC. After the first hydrogenation, the bulky tert-butyl group on the newly formed (Z)-alkene sterically hinders the adsorption of the remaining alkyne moiety onto the flat surface of the palladium catalyst, preventing the second hydrogenation step.\nD. The second hydrogenation to form the (Z,Z)-diene is thermodynamically unfavorable (endergonic), whereas the first hydrogenation to the enyne is thermodynamically favorable (exergonic).\nE. The C-H bond of the vinylic hydrogen in the (Z)-enyne intermediate preferentially adsorbs to the catalyst surface over the alkyne's pi-bonds, effectively blocking the active sites.", "solution": "Relevant principles:\n- Heterogeneous Lindlar hydrogenation proceeds by syn addition of surface-adsorbed hydrogen to an alkyne that must first adsorb to the palladium surface with its $\\pi$-system cofacial to the metal. Efficient reaction requires the alkyne to approach and bind in a relatively flat geometry to the Pd surface; steric bulk near the alkyne strongly impedes this adsorption and thereby suppresses hydrogenation.\n- The first hydrogenation of an internal alkyne under Lindlar conditions gives a $Z$-alkene due to syn addition on the surface.\n- Thermodynamically, hydrogenation of $\\pi$-bonds to form stronger $\\sigma$-bonds is broadly exergonic; suppression of further hydrogenation under Lindlar conditions is therefore a kinetic/adsorption phenomenon, not a reversal of thermodynamic driving force.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning applied to 1,4-di-tert-butylbuta-1,3-diyne:\n1) The starting diyne, tert-butyl–$C\\equiv C$–$C\\equiv C$–tert-butyl, can adsorb one of its alkynes onto the poisoned Pd surface and undergo syn addition of $H_{2}$ to give the $Z$-alkene, producing the enyne (Z)-tert-butyl–$CH=CH$–$C\\equiv C$–tert-butyl.\n2) This newly formed $Z$-alkene places the tert-butyl group on the same face as the carbon chain. As a consequence, when attempting a second hydrogenation on the remaining internal alkyne, the molecule would need to present that alkyne flat to the Pd surface. However, the $Z$-alkene’s syn-oriented tert-butyl group now creates a severe steric clash with the surface and/or blocks conformations that allow the distal $C\\equiv C$ to adsorb cofacially to Pd. With two tert-butyl groups at the termini, this steric congestion is especially pronounced.\n3) Because adsorption is the prerequisite for catalytic hydrogenation on Lindlar Pd, this steric inhibition of adsorption by the $Z$-alkene tert-butyl substituent kinetically arrests further hydrogenation at the enyne stage, even though the second hydrogenation would be thermodynamically favorable.\n\nExcluding the alternatives:\n- A is inadequate: both the starting diyne and the enyne are conjugated systems. Purely electronic conjugation effects do not invert reactivity so dramatically; under Lindlar conditions the dominant determinant is adsorption geometry and steric accessibility, not electronic deactivation of the remaining alkyne.\n- B is implausible: the enyne product is not a more potent poison than the deliberately added quinoline/lead modifiers; selective arrest occurs through hindered adsorption, not wholesale catalyst deactivation by the product.\n- D is incorrect: hydrogenation of a second alkyne to form a diene remains exergonic; the observed selectivity is kinetic, not due to an endergonic step.\n- E is unsupported: vinylic C–H bonds do not preferentially adsorb to Pd over $\\pi$-bonds to block sites; adsorption and reaction occur via the $\\pi$-systems.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate rationale is steric hindrance of adsorption after formation of the $Z$-alkene, i.e., option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2188623"}]}
